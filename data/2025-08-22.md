### [1] [Heatmap Regression without Soft-Argmax for Facial Landmark Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14929)
*Chiao-An Yang,Raymond A. Yeh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文重新审视了面部关键点检测中广泛使用的Soft-argmax方法，提出了一种基于结构化预测框架的替代训练目标，在多个基准测试中实现了最先进性能，训练收敛速度提升2.2倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 热图回归方法在面部关键点检测中广泛应用，但argmax操作不可微分，传统使用Soft-argmax作为近似。作者质疑这种长期选择是否唯一最优方案，寻求替代方法。

Method: 提出基于经典结构化预测框架的训练目标替代Soft-argmax，避免了近似操作，实现了端到端可微分训练。

Result: 在WFLW、COFW和300W三个面部关键点基准测试中达到最先进性能，训练收敛速度快2.2倍，同时保持更好或相当的精度。

Conclusion: Soft-argmax并非实现高性能的唯一途径，结构化预测框架提供了有效的替代方案，在保持精度的同时显著提升训练效率。

Abstract: Facial landmark detection is an important task in computer vision with
numerous applications, such as head pose estimation, expression analysis, face
swapping, etc. Heatmap regression-based methods have been widely used to
achieve state-of-the-art results in this task. These methods involve computing
the argmax over the heatmaps to predict a landmark. Since argmax is not
differentiable, these methods use a differentiable approximation, Soft-argmax,
to enable end-to-end training on deep-nets. In this work, we revisit this
long-standing choice of using Soft-argmax and demonstrate that it is not the
only way to achieve strong performance. Instead, we propose an alternative
training objective based on the classic structured prediction framework.
Empirically, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on three facial
landmark benchmarks (WFLW, COFW, and 300W), converging 2.2x faster during
training while maintaining better/competitive accuracy. Our code is available
here: https://github.com/ca-joe-yang/regression-without-softarg.

### [2] [Fast Graph Neural Network for Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14958)
*Mustafa Mohammadi Gharasuie,Luis Rueda*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新题的图卷积神经网络方法，通过结合Voronoi图和Delaunay三角化来优化图像图表示，在多个标准数据集上实现了预处理效率和分类准确性的显著提升，超越了现有最优方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统卷积神经网络(CNNs)在处理复杂数据结构时有限，而图卷积神经网络(GCNs)能够更有效地模型关联数据。研究者想要利用Voronoi图的特性来增强图像分类的性能。

Method: 将图像表示为图结构，像素或区域作为顶点，然后使用对应的Delaunay三角化来精炼图表示以优化其结构。通过结合GCNs和Voronoi图的新题方法来提升图像分类性能。

Result: 在多个标准数据集上进行了实验，通过交叉验证确认了方法的有效性。结果显示该方法在预处理效率和分类准确性方面都实现了显著提升，特别是在复杂场景和细粒度分类任务中超越了现有最优方法。

Conclusion: 这项研究不仅为图像分类提供了新题视角，还扩展了图基学习范式在计算机视觉和非结构化数据分析中的潜在应用。GCNs与Voronoi图的结合为图像分类领域带来了重要进步。

Abstract: The rapid progress in image classification has been largely driven by the
adoption of Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs), which offer a robust framework
for handling complex data structures. This study introduces a novel approach
that integrates GCNs with Voronoi diagrams to enhance image classification by
leveraging their ability to effectively model relational data. Unlike
conventional convolutional neural networks (CNNs), our method represents images
as graphs, where pixels or regions function as vertices. These graphs are then
refined using corresponding Delaunay triangulations, optimizing their
representation. The proposed model achieves significant improvements in both
preprocessing efficiency and classification accuracy across various benchmark
datasets, surpassing state-of-the-art approaches, particularly in challenging
scenarios involving intricate scenes and fine-grained categories. Experimental
results, validated through cross-validation, underscore the effectiveness of
combining GCNs with Voronoi diagrams for advancing image classification. This
research not only presents a novel perspective on image classification but also
expands the potential applications of graph-based learning paradigms in
computer vision and unstructured data analysis.

### [3] [You Only Pose Once: A Minimalist's Detection Transformer for Monocular RGB Category-level 9D Multi-Object Pose Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14965)
*Hakjin Lee,Junghoon Seo,Jaehoon Sim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: YOPO是一个单阶段、基于查询的框架，将类别级9自由度姿态估计统一到2D检测中，仅使用RGB图像就达到了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖伪深度、CAD模型或多阶段级联，需要开发更简单的RGB-only替代方案，直接在类别级别学习，统一目标检测和9自由度姿态估计。

Method: 在transformer检测器基础上增加轻量级姿态头、边界框条件平移模块和6D感知匈牙利匹配成本，仅使用RGB图像和类别级姿态标签进行端到端训练。

Result: 在REAL275数据集上达到79.6% IoU50和54.1% 10°10cm指标，超越所有RGB-only方法，缩小了与RGB-D系统的差距。

Conclusion: YOPO证明了单阶段RGB-only方法可以在类别级9自由度姿态估计任务中实现高性能，无需额外数据或复杂多阶段流程。

Abstract: Accurately recovering the full 9-DoF pose of unseen instances within specific
categories from a single RGB image remains a core challenge for robotics and
automation. Most existing solutions still rely on pseudo-depth, CAD models, or
multi-stage cascades that separate 2D detection from pose estimation. Motivated
by the need for a simpler, RGB-only alternative that learns directly at the
category level, we revisit a longstanding question: Can object detection and
9-DoF pose estimation be unified with high performance, without any additional
data? We show that they can with our method, YOPO, a single-stage, query-based
framework that treats category-level 9-DoF estimation as a natural extension of
2D detection. YOPO augments a transformer detector with a lightweight pose
head, a bounding-box-conditioned translation module, and a 6D-aware Hungarian
matching cost. The model is trained end-to-end only with RGB images and
category-level pose labels. Despite its minimalist design, YOPO sets a new
state of the art on three benchmarks. On the REAL275 dataset, it achieves 79.6%
$\rm{IoU}_{50}$ and 54.1% under the $10^\circ$$10{\rm{cm}}$ metric, surpassing
prior RGB-only methods and closing much of the gap to RGB-D systems. The code,
models, and additional qualitative results can be found on our project.

### [4] [Paired-Sampling Contrastive Framework for Joint Physical-Digital Face Attack Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14980)
*Andrei Balykin,Anvar Ganiev,Denis Kondranin,Kirill Polevoda,Nikolai Liudkevich,Artem Petrov*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种统一的对抗物理和数字人脸欺骗攻击的训练框架，通过配对采样对比学习实现模态无关的活体检测，在基准测试中达到2.10%的错误率，且计算轻量高效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统人脸识别系统使用独立模型分别处理物理呈现攻击和数字伪造攻击，这增加了系统复杂性、推理延迟，且无法应对组合攻击向量。

Method: 提出了配对采样对比框架，利用自动匹配的真实和攻击自拍对，学习模态无关的活体线索，实现统一的训练方法。

Result: 在第6届人脸反欺骗挑战赛统一物理-数字攻击检测基准上，平均分类错误率(ACER)达到2.10%，优于先前解决方案，且模型轻量(4.46 GFLOPs)，训练时间少于一小时。

Conclusion: 该框架提供了一种实用且高效的统一解决方案，能够同时应对物理和数字人脸欺骗攻击，适合实际部署应用。

Abstract: Modern face recognition systems remain vulnerable to spoofing attempts,
including both physical presentation attacks and digital forgeries.
Traditionally, these two attack vectors have been handled by separate models,
each targeting its own artifacts and modalities. However, maintaining distinct
detectors increases system complexity and inference latency and leaves systems
exposed to combined attack vectors. We propose the Paired-Sampling Contrastive
Framework, a unified training approach that leverages automatically matched
pairs of genuine and attack selfies to learn modality-agnostic liveness cues.
Evaluated on the 6th Face Anti-Spoofing Challenge Unified Physical-Digital
Attack Detection benchmark, our method achieves an average classification error
rate (ACER) of 2.10 percent, outperforming prior solutions. The framework is
lightweight (4.46 GFLOPs) and trains in under one hour, making it practical for
real-world deployment. Code and pretrained models are available at
https://github.com/xPONYx/iccv2025_deepfake_challenge.

### [5] [TAIGen: Training-Free Adversarial Image Generation via Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15020)
*Susim Roy,Anubhooti Jain,Mayank Vatsa,Richa Singh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TAIGen是一种无需训练的黑盒对抗图像生成方法，仅需3-20个采样步骤即可从无条件扩散模型生成高质量对抗样本，攻击成功率高且计算效率提升10倍


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有生成模型的对抗攻击往往产生低质量图像且计算资源需求大，扩散模型虽然能生成高质量图像但通常需要数百个采样步骤，需要开发更高效的对抗生成方法

Method: 通过在混合步骤区间注入扰动实现有效攻击，无需处理所有时间步；采用选择性RGB通道策略，对红色通道应用注意力图，对绿色和蓝色通道使用GradCAM引导的扰动

Result: 在ImageNet数据集上，对VGGNet源模型，攻击ResNet成功率达70.6%，MNASNet达80.8%，ShuffleNet达97.8%；PSNR超过30dB保持视觉质量；生成速度比现有扩散攻击快10倍

Conclusion: TAIGen实现了最有效的对抗攻击，防御机制对其生成的图像净化效果最差，表明该方法具有最强的攻击影响力

Abstract: Adversarial attacks from generative models often produce low-quality images
and require substantial computational resources. Diffusion models, though
capable of high-quality generation, typically need hundreds of sampling steps
for adversarial generation. This paper introduces TAIGen, a training-free
black-box method for efficient adversarial image generation. TAIGen produces
adversarial examples using only 3-20 sampling steps from unconditional
diffusion models. Our key finding is that perturbations injected during the
mixing step interval achieve comparable attack effectiveness without processing
all timesteps. We develop a selective RGB channel strategy that applies
attention maps to the red channel while using GradCAM-guided perturbations on
green and blue channels. This design preserves image structure while maximizing
misclassification in target models. TAIGen maintains visual quality with PSNR
above 30 dB across all tested datasets. On ImageNet with VGGNet as source,
TAIGen achieves 70.6% success against ResNet, 80.8% against MNASNet, and 97.8%
against ShuffleNet. The method generates adversarial examples 10x faster than
existing diffusion-based attacks. Our method achieves the lowest robust
accuracy, indicating it is the most impactful attack as the defense mechanism
is least successful in purifying the images generated by TAIGen.

### [6] [Reversible Unfolding Network for Concealed Visual Perception with Generative Refinement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15027)
*Chunming He,Fengyang Xiao,Rihan Zhang,Chengyu Fang,Deng-Ping Fan,Sina Farsiu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RUN++是一个可逆展开网络，通过生成式细化解决隐蔽视觉感知问题，在掩码和RGB域同时应用可逆建模，并使用扩散模型处理不确定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有隐蔽视觉感知方法主要局限于掩码域的可逆策略，未能充分利用RGB域的潜力，且存在不确定性处理不足的问题。

Method: 将CVP任务建模为数学优化问题，展开为多阶段深度网络。包含三个模块：CORE模块在掩码域进行可逆建模识别核心对象区域；CARE模块在RGB域扩展可逆原则实现前景-背景分离；FINE模块使用定向Bernoulli扩散模型细化不确定区域。

Result: 提出的方法能够有效减少假阳性和假阴性，在真实世界退化条件下保持鲁棒性，计算成本低于全图像处理过程。

Conclusion: RUN++通过可逆展开网络与生成式细化的独特协同，为构建鲁棒的CVP系统提供了新范式，并扩展为更广泛的双层优化框架。

Abstract: Existing methods for concealed visual perception (CVP) often leverage
reversible strategies to decrease uncertainty, yet these are typically confined
to the mask domain, leaving the potential of the RGB domain underexplored. To
address this, we propose a reversible unfolding network with generative
refinement, termed RUN++. Specifically, RUN++ first formulates the CVP task as
a mathematical optimization problem and unfolds the iterative solution into a
multi-stage deep network. This approach provides a principled way to apply
reversible modeling across both mask and RGB domains while leveraging a
diffusion model to resolve the resulting uncertainty. Each stage of the network
integrates three purpose-driven modules: a Concealed Object Region Extraction
(CORE) module applies reversible modeling to the mask domain to identify core
object regions; a Context-Aware Region Enhancement (CARE) module extends this
principle to the RGB domain to foster better foreground-background separation;
and a Finetuning Iteration via Noise-based Enhancement (FINE) module provides a
final refinement. The FINE module introduces a targeted Bernoulli diffusion
model that refines only the uncertain regions of the segmentation mask,
harnessing the generative power of diffusion for fine-detail restoration
without the prohibitive computational cost of a full-image process. This unique
synergy, where the unfolding network provides a strong uncertainty prior for
the diffusion model, allows RUN++ to efficiently direct its focus toward
ambiguous areas, significantly mitigating false positives and negatives.
Furthermore, we introduce a new paradigm for building robust CVP systems that
remain effective under real-world degradations and extend this concept into a
broader bi-level optimization framework.

*Toqi Tahamid Sarker,Mohamed Embaby,Taminul Islam,Amer AbuGhazaleh,Khaled R Ahmed*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GasTwinFormer是一种混合视觉Transformer，用于实时监测牲畜甲烷排放，通过光学气体成像实现甲烷分割和饮食分类，在效率和准确性方面表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 牲畜甲烷排放占人为甲烷排放的32%，需要自动化监测来支持气候缓解策略。现有方法缺乏统一的实时监测解决方案。

Method: 提出混合视觉Transformer架构，采用新颖的Mix Twin编码器，交替使用空间缩减全局注意力和局部分组注意力机制，配合轻量级LR-ASPP解码器进行多尺度特征聚合。

Result: 在11,694帧标注数据上达到74.47% mIoU和83.63% mF1分割精度，仅3.348M参数和3.428G FLOPs，推理速度114.9 FPS，饮食分类准确率100%。

Conclusion: GasTwinFormer通过有效利用饮食-排放相关性，为实时牲畜排放监测提供了实用解决方案，消融研究验证了各架构组件的有效性。

Abstract: Livestock methane emissions represent 32% of human-caused methane production,
making automated monitoring critical for climate mitigation strategies. We
introduce GasTwinFormer, a hybrid vision transformer for real-time methane
emission segmentation and dietary classification in optical gas imaging through
a novel Mix Twin encoder alternating between spatially-reduced global attention
and locally-grouped attention mechanisms. Our architecture incorporates a
lightweight LR-ASPP decoder for multi-scale feature aggregation and enables
simultaneous methane segmentation and dietary classification in a unified
framework. We contribute the first comprehensive beef cattle methane emission
dataset using OGI, containing 11,694 annotated frames across three dietary
treatments. GasTwinFormer achieves 74.47% mIoU and 83.63% mF1 for segmentation
while maintaining exceptional efficiency with only 3.348M parameters, 3.428G
FLOPs, and 114.9 FPS inference speed. Additionally, our method achieves perfect
dietary classification accuracy (100%), demonstrating the effectiveness of
leveraging diet-emission correlations. Extensive ablation studies validate each
architectural component, establishing GasTwinFormer as a practical solution for
real-time livestock emission monitoring. Please see our project page at

### [8] [CurveFlow: Curvature-Guided Flow Matching for Image Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15093)
*Yan Luo,Drake Du,Hao Huang,Yi Fang,Mengyu Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CurveFlow通过引入曲率正则化来学习非线性轨迹，在文本到图像生成任务中实现了最先进的性能，显著提升了语义一致性和图像质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的整流流模型基于数据和噪声分布之间的线性轨迹，这种线性性强制零曲率，可能迫使图像生成过程通过数据流形的低概率区域。需要探索轨迹曲率如何与生成图像和对应标题之间的语义对齐（即指令遵循）相关联。

Method: 提出CurveFlow框架，通过直接在流路径中融入曲率指导来学习平滑的非线性轨迹。采用鲁棒的曲率正则化技术，惩罚轨迹内在动力学的突变。

Result: 在MS COCO 2014和2017数据集上的广泛实验表明，CurveFlow在文本到图像生成中达到最先进性能，显著优于标准整流流变体和其他非线性基线如Rectified Diffusion。在BLEU、METEOR、ROUGE和CLAIR等语义一致性指标上改进尤为明显。

Conclusion: 曲率感知建模显著增强了模型忠实遵循复杂指令的能力，同时保持高图像质量。代码已公开。

Abstract: Existing rectified flow models are based on linear trajectories between data
and noise distributions. This linearity enforces zero curvature, which can
inadvertently force the image generation process through low-probability
regions of the data manifold. A key question remains underexplored: how does
the curvature of these trajectories correlate with the semantic alignment
between generated images and their corresponding captions, i.e., instructional
compliance? To address this, we introduce CurveFlow, a novel flow matching
framework designed to learn smooth, non-linear trajectories by directly
incorporating curvature guidance into the flow path. Our method features a
robust curvature regularization technique that penalizes abrupt changes in the
trajectory's intrinsic dynamics.Extensive experiments on MS COCO 2014 and 2017
demonstrate that CurveFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance in
text-to-image generation, significantly outperforming both standard rectified
flow variants and other non-linear baselines like Rectified Diffusion. The
improvements are especially evident in semantic consistency metrics such as
BLEU, METEOR, ROUGE, and CLAIR. This confirms that our curvature-aware modeling
substantially enhances the model's ability to faithfully follow complex
instructions while simultaneously maintaining high image quality. The code is
made publicly available at
https://github.com/Harvard-AI-and-Robotics-Lab/CurveFlow.

### [9] [HiRQA: Hierarchical Ranking and Quality Alignment for Opinion-Unaware Image Quality Assessment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15130)
*Vaishnav Ramesh,Haining Wang,Md Jahidul Islam*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HiRQA是一个自监督的无参考图像质量评估框架，通过分层排序和质量对齐实现质量感知嵌入，无需参考图像或主观标签，在合成和真实失真场景下都表现出优异性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的无参考图像质量评估方法存在数据集偏见和依赖主观标签的问题，限制了其泛化性能。需要开发不依赖原始参考图像或辅助模态的自监督方法。

Method: 提出HiRQA框架，结合排序学习和对比学习：1）高阶排序损失监督质量预测的关系排序；2）嵌入距离损失确保特征距离与感知差异一致；3）基于结构化文本提示的对比对齐损失增强表示学习。

Result: 仅在合成失真上训练的HiRQA能有效泛化到真实退化场景（如镜头光晕、雾霾、运动模糊、低光条件）。轻量版HiRQA-S推理时间仅3.5ms/图像，在合成和真实基准测试中达到SOTA性能。

Conclusion: HiRQA通过自监督的层次化排序和质量对齐方法，解决了NR-IQA的泛化问题，在保持高精度的同时实现了实时部署能力，为无参考图像质量评估提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Despite significant progress in no-reference image quality assessment
(NR-IQA), dataset biases and reliance on subjective labels continue to hinder
their generalization performance. We propose HiRQA, Hierarchical Ranking and
Quality Alignment), a self-supervised, opinion-unaware framework that offers a
hierarchical, quality-aware embedding through a combination of ranking and
contrastive learning. Unlike prior approaches that depend on pristine
references or auxiliary modalities at inference time, HiRQA predicts quality
scores using only the input image. We introduce a novel higher-order ranking
loss that supervises quality predictions through relational ordering across
distortion pairs, along with an embedding distance loss that enforces
consistency between feature distances and perceptual differences. A
training-time contrastive alignment loss, guided by structured textual prompts,
further enhances the learned representation. Trained only on synthetic
distortions, HiRQA generalizes effectively to authentic degradations, as
demonstrated through evaluation on various distortions such as lens flare,
haze, motion blur, and low-light conditions. For real-time deployment, we
introduce \textbf{HiRQA-S}, a lightweight variant with an inference time of
only 3.5 ms per image. Extensive experiments across synthetic and authentic
benchmarks validate HiRQA's state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance, strong
generalization ability, and scalability.

### [10] [Reliable Multi-view 3D Reconstruction for `Just-in-time' Edge Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15158)
*Md. Nurul Absur,Abhinav Kumar,Swastik Brahma,Saptarshi Debroy*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出基于投资组合理论的边缘资源管理策略，用于在时空相关中断情况下保证多视角3D重建的可靠性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 应急响应等关键应用需要近实时3D重建，但边缘环境的动态性和操作逆境会导致相机操作中断，影响重建质量

Method: 采用投资组合理论启发的方法，通过遗传算法解决优化问题，选择最优相机组合以应对时空相关中断

Result: 在公开和定制3D数据集上的实验表明，该方法相比传统基线策略能更好地保证3D重建的可靠性

Conclusion: 提出的相机选择策略能有效应对边缘环境中的时空相关中断，确保多视角3D重建的质量满足要求

Abstract: Multi-view 3D reconstruction applications are revolutionizing critical use
cases that require rapid situational-awareness, such as emergency response,
tactical scenarios, and public safety. In many cases, their near-real-time
latency requirements and ad-hoc needs for compute resources necessitate
adoption of `Just-in-time' edge environments where the system is set up on the
fly to support the applications during the mission lifetime. However,
reliability issues can arise from the inherent dynamism and operational
adversities of such edge environments, resulting in spatiotemporally correlated
disruptions that impact the camera operations, which can lead to sustained
degradation of reconstruction quality. In this paper, we propose a novel
portfolio theory inspired edge resource management strategy for reliable
multi-view 3D reconstruction against possible system disruptions. Our proposed
methodology can guarantee reconstruction quality satisfaction even when the
cameras are prone to spatiotemporally correlated disruptions. The portfolio
theoretic optimization problem is solved using a genetic algorithm that
converges quickly for realistic system settings. Using publicly available and
customized 3D datasets, we demonstrate the proposed camera selection strategy's
benefits in guaranteeing reliable 3D reconstruction against traditional
baseline strategies, under spatiotemporal disruptions.

Conclusion: XDR-LVLM成功弥合了自动化诊断与临床需求之间的差距，通过提供可解释的洞察力增强了糖尿病视网膜病变诊断的透明度和可信度

Abstract: Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is a major cause of global blindness, necessitating
early and accurate diagnosis. While deep learning models have shown promise in
DR detection, their black-box nature often hinders clinical adoption due to a
lack of transparency and interpretability. To address this, we propose XDR-LVLM
(eXplainable Diabetic Retinopathy Diagnosis with LVLM), a novel framework that
leverages Vision-Language Large Models (LVLMs) for high-precision DR diagnosis
coupled with natural language-based explanations. XDR-LVLM integrates a
specialized Medical Vision Encoder, an LVLM Core, and employs Multi-task Prompt
Engineering and Multi-stage Fine-tuning to deeply understand pathological
features within fundus images and generate comprehensive diagnostic reports.
These reports explicitly include DR severity grading, identification of key
pathological concepts (e.g., hemorrhages, exudates, microaneurysms), and
detailed explanations linking observed features to the diagnosis. Extensive
experiments on the Diabetic Retinopathy (DDR) dataset demonstrate that XDR-LVLM
achieves state-of-the-art performance, with a Balanced Accuracy of 84.55% and
an F1 Score of 79.92% for disease diagnosis, and superior results for concept
detection (77.95% BACC, 66.88% F1). Furthermore, human evaluations confirm the
high fluency, accuracy, and clinical utility of the generated explanations,
showcasing XDR-LVLM's ability to bridge the gap between automated diagnosis and
clinical needs by providing robust and interpretable insights.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 城市网格模型缺乏真实纹理，限制了在虚拟城市导航和自动驾驶中的应用，现有图像和视频扩散模型难以直接生成3D一致场景

Method: 三阶段管道：1)使用级联外绘ControlNet生成几何一致的稀疏视图；2)通过AGInpaint传播更密集的中间视图；3)使用GCAlign模块全局消除视觉不一致性，同时重建3D高斯溅射场景

Conclusion: MeSS方法成功解决了城市网格模型的纹理生成问题，为虚拟城市应用提供了高质量的3D一致场景生成方案

Abstract: Mesh models have become increasingly accessible for numerous cities; however,
the lack of realistic textures restricts their application in virtual urban
navigation and autonomous driving. To address this, this paper proposes MeSS
(Meshbased Scene Synthesis) for generating high-quality, styleconsistent
outdoor scenes with city mesh models serving as the geometric prior. While
image and video diffusion models can leverage spatial layouts (such as depth
maps or HD maps) as control conditions to generate street-level perspective
views, they are not directly applicable to 3D scene generation. Video diffusion
models excel at synthesizing consistent view sequences that depict scenes but
often struggle to adhere to predefined camera paths or align accurately with
rendered control videos. In contrast, image diffusion models, though unable to
guarantee cross-view visual consistency, can produce more geometry-aligned
results when combined with ControlNet. Building on this insight, our approach
enhances image diffusion models by improving cross-view consistency. The
pipeline comprises three key stages: first, we generate geometrically
consistent sparse views using Cascaded Outpainting ControlNets; second, we
propagate denser intermediate views via a component dubbed AGInpaint; and
third, we globally eliminate visual inconsistencies (e.g., varying exposure)
using the GCAlign module. Concurrently with generation, a 3D Gaussian Splatting
(3DGS) scene is reconstructed by initializing Gaussian balls on the mesh
surface. Our method outperforms existing approaches in both geometric alignment
and generation quality. Once synthesized, the scene can be rendered in diverse
styles through relighting and style transfer techniques.

Abstract: Surgical site infection (SSI) is one of the most common and costly
healthcare-associated infections and and surgical wound care remains a
significant clinical challenge in preventing SSIs and improving patient
outcomes. While recent studies have explored the use of deep learning for
preliminary surgical wound screening, progress has been hindered by concerns
over data privacy and the high costs associated with expert annotation.
Currently, no publicly available dataset or benchmark encompasses various types
of surgical wounds, resulting in the absence of an open-source Surgical-Wound
screening tool. To address this gap: (1) we present SurgWound, the first
open-source dataset featuring a diverse array of surgical wound types. It
contains 697 surgical wound images annotated by 3 professional surgeons with
eight fine-grained clinical attributes. (2) Based on SurgWound, we introduce
the first benchmark for surgical wound diagnosis, which includes visual
question answering (VQA) and report generation tasks to comprehensively
evaluate model performance. (3) Furthermore, we propose a three-stage learning
framework, WoundQwen, for surgical wound diagnosis. In the first stage, we
employ five independent MLLMs to accurately predict specific surgical wound
characteristics. In the second stage, these predictions serve as additional
knowledge inputs to two MLLMs responsible for diagnosing outcomes, which assess
infection risk and guide subsequent interventions. In the third stage, we train
a MLLM that integrates the diagnostic results from the previous two stages to
produce a comprehensive report. This three-stage framework can analyze detailed
surgical wound characteristics and provide subsequent instructions to patients
based on surgical images, paving the way for personalized wound care, timely
intervention, and improved patient outcomes.

Abstract: Existing approaches in reinforcement learning train an agent to learn desired
optimal behavior in an environment with rule based surrounding agents. In
safety critical applications such as autonomous driving it is crucial that the
rule based agents are modelled properly. Several behavior modelling strategies
and IDM models are used currently to model the surrounding agents. We present a

Abstract: Accurate morphological quantification of renal pathology functional units
relies on instance-level segmentation, yet most existing datasets and automated
methods provide only binary (semantic) masks, limiting the precision of
downstream analyses. Although classical post-processing techniques such as
watershed, morphological operations, and skeletonization, are often used to
separate semantic masks into instances, their individual effectiveness is
constrained by the diverse morphologies and complex connectivity found in renal
tissue. In this study, we present DyMorph-B2I, a dynamic, morphology-guided
binary-to-instance segmentation pipeline tailored for renal pathology. Our
approach integrates watershed, skeletonization, and morphological operations
within a unified framework, complemented by adaptive geometric refinement and
customizable hyperparameter tuning for each class of functional unit. Through
systematic parameter optimization, DyMorph-B2I robustly separates adherent and
heterogeneous structures present in binary masks. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method outperforms individual classical approaches and
na\"ive combinations, enabling superior instance separation and facilitating
more accurate morphometric analysis in renal pathology workflows. The pipeline

Conclusion: 证明了仅使用拆录摄像头视频输入可以实现高效的交通事故预测，STAGNet模型在预测精度和预警时间方面都显著改进

Abstract: Accident prediction and timely warnings play a key role in improving road
safety by reducing the risk of injury to road users and minimizing property
damage. Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) are designed to support human
drivers and are especially useful when they can anticipate potential accidents
before they happen. While many existing systems depend on a range of sensors
such as LiDAR, radar, and GPS, relying solely on dash-cam video input presents
a more challenging but a more cost-effective and easily deployable solution. In
this work, we incorporate better spatio-temporal features and aggregate them
through a recurrent network to improve upon state-of-the-art graph neural
networks for predicting accidents from dash-cam videos. Experiments using three
publicly available datasets show that our proposed STAGNet model achieves
higher average precision and mean time-to-collision values than previous
methods, both when cross-validated on a given dataset and when trained and
tested on different datasets.

TL;DR: TriMM是首个前馈式3D原生生成模型，通过整合RGB、RGBD和点云等多模态数据，利用协作多模态编码和三平面潜在扩散模型，实现高质量的3D资产生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的3D生成架构大多局限于单一模态或3D结构，无法充分利用多模态数据的互补优势，限制了训练数据集的范围和模型性能。

Method: 1) 引入协作多模态编码整合模态特定特征；2) 使用辅助2D和3D监督提升鲁棒性；3) 基于三平面潜在扩散模型生成高质量3D资产

Result: 在多个知名数据集上的实验表明，TriMM通过有效利用多模态数据，在使用少量训练数据的情况下实现了与大规模数据集训练模型相竞争的性能

Conclusion: TriMM证明了多模态数据在3D生成中的有效性，并为整合其他多模态数据集到3D生成中提供了可行性

Abstract: 3D content inherently encompasses multi-modal characteristics and can be
projected into different modalities (e.g., RGB images, RGBD, and point clouds).
Each modality exhibits distinct advantages in 3D asset modeling: RGB images
contain vivid 3D textures, whereas point clouds define fine-grained 3D
geometries. However, most existing 3D-native generative architectures either
operate predominantly within single-modality paradigms-thus overlooking the
complementary benefits of multi-modality data-or restrict themselves to 3D
structures, thereby limiting the scope of available training datasets. To
holistically harness multi-modalities for 3D modeling, we present TriMM, the
first feed-forward 3D-native generative model that learns from basic
multi-modalities (e.g., RGB, RGBD, and point cloud). Specifically, 1) TriMM
first introduces collaborative multi-modal coding, which integrates
modality-specific features while preserving their unique representational
strengths. 2) Furthermore, auxiliary 2D and 3D supervision are introduced to
raise the robustness and performance of multi-modal coding. 3) Based on the
embedded multi-modal code, TriMM employs a triplane latent diffusion model to
generate 3D assets of superior quality, enhancing both the texture and the
geometric detail. Extensive experiments on multiple well-known datasets
demonstrate that TriMM, by effectively leveraging multi-modality, achieves
competitive performance with models trained on large-scale datasets, despite
utilizing a small amount of training data. Furthermore, we conduct additional
experiments on recent RGB-D datasets, verifying the feasibility of
incorporating other multi-modal datasets into 3D generation.

Motivation: 现有对比学习方法在聚类任务中存在类间冲突问题，硬原型计算与真实聚类中心存在偏差，需要更有效的原型计算方法。

Method: 采用软原型对比模块使用样本属于聚类中心的概率作为权重计算类别原型，双重一致性学习模块对齐相同样本的不同变换和不同样本的邻域。

Result: 在五个数据集上的大量实验表明，该方法相比最先进方法具有更好的效果。

Conclusion: 提出的中心导向原型对比聚类框架能有效减少类间冲突和原型漂移，提供可靠的语义信息和紧凑的类内分布。

Abstract: Contrastive learning is widely used in clustering tasks due to its
discriminative representation. However, the conflict problem between classes is
difficult to solve effectively. Existing methods try to solve this problem
through prototype contrast, but there is a deviation between the calculation of
hard prototypes and the true cluster center. To address this problem, we
propose a center-oriented prototype contrastive clustering framework, which
consists of a soft prototype contrastive module and a dual consistency learning
module. In short, the soft prototype contrastive module uses the probability
that the sample belongs to the cluster center as a weight to calculate the
prototype of each category, while avoiding inter-class conflicts and reducing
prototype drift. The dual consistency learning module aligns different
transformations of the same sample and the neighborhoods of different samples
respectively, ensuring that the features have transformation-invariant semantic
information and compact intra-cluster distribution, while providing reliable
guarantees for the calculation of prototypes. Extensive experiments on five
datasets show that the proposed method is effective compared to the SOTA. Our
code is published on https://github.com/LouisDong95/CPCC.

Conclusion: 双高度无人机协同框架能够有效结合广视角环境理解和精确导航能力，通过最小化信息交换实现高效协作，为复杂外部环境导航提供了新的解决方案

Abstract: Aerial Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) is an emerging task that enables
Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to navigate outdoor environments using natural
language instructions and visual cues. However, due to the extended
trajectories and complex maneuverability of UAVs, achieving reliable UAV-VLN
performance is challenging and often requires human intervention or overly
detailed instructions. To harness the advantages of UAVs' high mobility, which
could provide multi-grained perspectives, while maintaining a manageable motion
space for learning, we introduce a novel task called Dual-Altitude UAV
Collaborative VLN (DuAl-VLN). In this task, two UAVs operate at distinct
altitudes: a high-altitude UAV responsible for broad environmental reasoning,
and a low-altitude UAV tasked with precise navigation. To support the training
and evaluation of the DuAl-VLN, we construct the HaL-13k, a dataset comprising
13,838 collaborative high-low UAV demonstration trajectories, each paired with
target-oriented language instructions. This dataset includes both unseen maps
and an unseen object validation set to systematically evaluate the model's
generalization capabilities across novel environments and unfamiliar targets.
To consolidate their complementary strengths, we propose a dual-UAV
collaborative VLN framework, AeroDuo, where the high-altitude UAV integrates a
multimodal large language model (Pilot-LLM) for target reasoning, while the
low-altitude UAV employs a lightweight multi-stage policy for navigation and
target grounding. The two UAVs work collaboratively and only exchange minimal
coordinate information to ensure efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型虽然在各生成任务中表现优异，但其顺序生成过程需要多步迭代，采样效率低。现有方法如DDIM通过非马尔可夫过程减少采样步数，但缺乏对原始扩散过程能否以马尔可夫方式实现相同效率的理解。

Method: 提出跳过步采样机制，在迭代生成过程中绕过多个中间去噪步骤，与传统逐步细化不同。该方法从与标准扩散模型相同的训练目标推导而来，证明通过马尔可夫方式加速采样是预训练扩散模型的内在属性。还将该加速采样技术与DDIM结合提出增强生成方法。

Result: 在OpenAI ADM、Stable Diffusion和Open Sora等流行预训练扩散模型上的大量实验表明，该方法能以显著减少的采样步数实现高质量生成。

Conclusion: 跳过步采样机制是扩散模型的内在属性，可以通过马尔可夫方式实现高效采样，无需依赖非马尔可夫过程，为扩散模型的实际应用提供了更高效的采样方案。

Abstract: Diffusion models have been achieving state-of-the-art results across various
generation tasks. However, a notable drawback is their sequential generation
process, requiring long-sequence step-by-step generation. Existing methods,
such as DDIM, attempt to reduce sampling steps by constructing a class of
non-Markovian diffusion processes that maintain the same training objective.
However, there remains a gap in understanding whether the original diffusion
process can achieve the same efficiency without resorting to non-Markovian
processes. In this paper, we provide a confirmative answer and introduce
skipped-step sampling, a mechanism that bypasses multiple intermediate
denoising steps in the iterative generation process, in contrast with the
traditional step-by-step refinement of standard diffusion inference. Crucially,
we demonstrate that this skipped-step sampling mechanism is derived from the
same training objective as the standard diffusion model, indicating that
accelerated sampling via skipped-step sampling via a Markovian way is an
intrinsic property of pretrained diffusion models. Additionally, we propose an
enhanced generation method by integrating our accelerated sampling technique
with DDIM. Extensive experiments on popular pretrained diffusion models,
including the OpenAI ADM, Stable Diffusion, and Open Sora models, show that our
method achieves high-quality generation with significantly reduced sampling
steps.

Conclusion: 该方法为图像压缩中的人工通用智能提供了有前景的发展方向，实现了智能化的用户交互体验。

Abstract: We present Comp-X, the first intelligently interactive image compression
paradigm empowered by the impressive reasoning capability of large language
model (LLM) agent. Notably, commonly used image codecs usually suffer from
limited coding modes and rely on manual mode selection by engineers, making
them unfriendly for unprofessional users. To overcome this, we advance the
evolution of image coding paradigm by introducing three key innovations: (i)
multi-functional coding framework, which unifies different coding modes of
various objective/requirements, including human-machine perception, variable
coding, and spatial bit allocation, into one framework. (ii) interactive coding
agent, where we propose an augmented in-context learning method with coding
expert feedback to teach the LLM agent how to understand the coding request,
mode selection, and the use of the coding tools. (iii) IIC-bench, the first
dedicated benchmark comprising diverse user requests and the corresponding
annotations from coding experts, which is systematically designed for
intelligently interactive image compression evaluation. Extensive experimental
results demonstrate that our proposed Comp-X can understand the coding requests
efficiently and achieve impressive textual interaction capability. Meanwhile,
it can maintain comparable compression performance even with a single coding
framework, providing a promising avenue for artificial general intelligence
(AGI) in image compression.

Abstract: Anomaly detection in computational pathology aims to identify rare and scarce
anomalies where disease-related data are often limited or missing. Existing

built on a pre-trained vision-language model with a lightweight trainable MLP.
By incorporating both normal and abnormal pathology knowledge, Ano-NAViLa

Conclusion: RATopo通过冗余分配策略实现了数量丰富和几何多样化的拓扑监督，有效解决了现有方法监督范围有限的问题，显著提升了车道拓扑推理性能。

Abstract: Lane topology reasoning plays a critical role in autonomous driving by
modeling the connections among lanes and the topological relationships between
lanes and traffic elements. Most existing methods adopt a
first-detect-then-reason paradigm, where topological relationships are
supervised based on the one-to-one assignment results obtained during the
detection stage. This supervision strategy results in suboptimal topology
reasoning performance due to the limited range of valid supervision. In this
paper, we propose RATopo, a Redundancy Assignment strategy for lane Topology
reasoning that enables quantity-rich and geometry-diverse topology supervision.
Specifically, we restructure the Transformer decoder by swapping the
cross-attention and self-attention layers. This allows redundant lane
predictions to be retained before suppression, enabling effective one-to-many
assignment. We also instantiate multiple parallel cross-attention blocks with
independent parameters, which further enhances the diversity of detected lanes.
Extensive experiments on OpenLane-V2 demonstrate that our RATopo strategy is
model-agnostic and can be seamlessly integrated into existing topology
reasoning frameworks, consistently improving both lane-lane and lane-traffic
topology performance.

Abstract: In the field of design patent analysis, traditional tasks such as patent
classification and patent image retrieval heavily depend on the image data.
However, patent images -- typically consisting of sketches with abstract and
structural elements of an invention -- often fall short in conveying
comprehensive visual context and semantic information. This inadequacy can lead
to ambiguities in evaluation during prior art searches. Recent advancements in
vision-language models, such as CLIP, offer promising opportunities for more
reliable and accurate AI-driven patent analysis. In this work, we leverage CLIP
models to develop a unified framework DesignCLIP for design patent applications
with a large-scale dataset of U.S. design patents. To address the unique
characteristics of patent data, DesignCLIP incorporates class-aware
classification and contrastive learning, utilizing generated detailed captions
for patent images and multi-views image learning. We validate the effectiveness
of DesignCLIP across various downstream tasks, including patent classification
and patent retrieval. Additionally, we explore multimodal patent retrieval,
which provides the potential to enhance creativity and innovation in design by
offering more diverse sources of inspiration. Our experiments show that
DesignCLIP consistently outperforms baseline and SOTA models in the patent
domain on all tasks. Our findings underscore the promise of multimodal

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前超声视频CHD检测方法存在图像噪声、探头位置变异、忽略时序信息、仅限于二分类且缺乏预测校准等问题，需要开发更可靠的自动化诊断方法。

Method: 提出时序提示对齐(TPA)方法，利用基础图像-文本模型和提示感知对比学习：1)图像编码器提取帧特征；2)可训练时序提取器聚合心脏运动信息；3)边缘铰链对比损失对齐视频表示与类别文本提示；4)CVAESM模块学习潜在风格向量调制嵌入并量化分类不确定性。

Conclusion: TPA框架通过整合时序建模、提示感知对比学习和不确定性量化，显著提升了超声视频CHD分类的准确性和临床可靠性，为自动化心脏诊断提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Congenital heart defect (CHD) detection in ultrasound videos is hindered by
image noise and probe positioning variability. While automated methods can
reduce operator dependence, current machine learning approaches often neglect
temporal information, limit themselves to binary classification, and do not
account for prediction calibration. We propose Temporal Prompt Alignment (TPA),
a method leveraging foundation image-text model and prompt-aware contrastive
learning to classify fetal CHD on cardiac ultrasound videos. TPA extracts
features from each frame of video subclips using an image encoder, aggregates
them with a trainable temporal extractor to capture heart motion, and aligns
the video representation with class-specific text prompts via a margin-hinge
contrastive loss. To enhance calibration for clinical reliability, we introduce
a Conditional Variational Autoencoder Style Modulation (CVAESM) module, which
learns a latent style vector to modulate embeddings and quantifies
classification uncertainty. Evaluated on a private dataset for CHD detection
and on a large public dataset, EchoNet-Dynamic, for systolic dysfunction, TPA
achieves state-of-the-art macro F1 scores of 85.40% for CHD diagnosis, while
also reducing expected calibration error by 5.38% and adaptive ECE by 6.8%. On
EchoNet-Dynamic's three-class task, it boosts macro F1 by 4.73% (from 53.89% to
58.62%). Temporal Prompt Alignment (TPA) is a framework for fetal congenital
heart defect (CHD) classification in ultrasound videos that integrates temporal
modeling, prompt-aware contrastive learning, and uncertainty quantification.

Abstract: Real-time 3D trajectory player tracking in sports plays a crucial role in
tactical analysis, performance evaluation, and enhancing spectator experience.
Traditional systems rely on multi-camera setups, but are constrained by the
inherently two-dimensional nature of video data and the need for complex 3D
reconstruction processing, making real-time analysis challenging. Basketball,
in particular, represents one of the most difficult scenarios in the MOT field,
as ten players move rapidly and complexly within a confined court space, with
frequent occlusions caused by intense physical contact.
  To address these challenges, this paper constructs BasketLiDAR, the first
multimodal dataset in the sports MOT field that combines LiDAR point clouds
with synchronized multi-view camera footage in a professional basketball
environment, and proposes a novel MOT framework that simultaneously achieves
improved tracking accuracy and reduced computational cost. The BasketLiDAR
dataset contains a total of 4,445 frames and 3,105 player IDs, with fully
synchronized IDs between three LiDAR sensors and three multi-view cameras. We
recorded 5-on-5 and 3-on-3 game data from actual professional basketball
players, providing complete 3D positional information and ID annotations for
each player. Based on this dataset, we developed a novel MOT algorithm that
leverages LiDAR's high-precision 3D spatial information. The proposed method
consists of a real-time tracking pipeline using LiDAR alone and a multimodal

TL;DR: 提出RAG-SEG训练自由范式，通过检索增强生成粗掩码作为提示，再用SAM进行精炼，无需传统训练即可在COD任务上达到SOTA性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有COD方法需要大量训练和计算资源，基础模型如SAM需要高质量提示但手动生成成本高，需要更高效实用的解决方案

Method: 两阶段方法：第一阶段RAG通过无监督聚类构建检索数据库生成粗掩码提示，第二阶段SEG使用SAM2进行精炼分割

Result: 在基准COD数据集上达到或超越最先进方法性能，所有实验在个人笔记本上完成，计算效率高

Conclusion: RAG-SEG提供了一种无需训练的高效COD解决方案，具有实际应用价值，计算资源需求低

Abstract: Camouflaged object detection (COD) poses a significant challenge in computer
vision due to the high similarity between objects and their backgrounds.
Existing approaches often rely on heavy training and large computational
resources. While foundation models such as the Segment Anything Model (SAM)
offer strong generalization, they still struggle to handle COD tasks without
fine-tuning and require high-quality prompts to yield good performance.
However, generating such prompts manually is costly and inefficient. To address
these challenges, we propose \textbf{First RAG, Second SEG (RAG-SEG)}, a
training-free paradigm that decouples COD into two stages: Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) for generating coarse masks as prompts, followed by SAM-based
segmentation (SEG) for refinement. RAG-SEG constructs a compact retrieval
database via unsupervised clustering, enabling fast and effective feature
retrieval. During inference, the retrieved features produce pseudo-labels that
guide precise mask generation using SAM2. Our method eliminates the need for
conventional training while maintaining competitive performance. Extensive
experiments on benchmark COD datasets demonstrate that RAG-SEG performs on par
with or surpasses state-of-the-art methods. Notably, all experiments are
conducted on a \textbf{personal laptop}, highlighting the computational
efficiency and practicality of our approach. We present further analysis in the
Appendix, covering limitations, salient object detection extension, and
possible improvements.

TL;DR: VideoEraser是一个无需训练的即插即用框架，通过两阶段处理有效防止文本到视频扩散模型生成不良内容，在多个擦除任务中平均减少46%的不良内容生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文本到视频扩散模型的快速发展引发了隐私、版权和安全问题，这些模型可能被滥用来生成有害或误导性内容，需要一种有效的方法来防止不良内容的生成。

Method: 采用两阶段处理：选择性提示嵌入调整（SPEA）和抗干扰噪声引导（ARNG），作为即插即用模块与现有T2V扩散模型无缝集成。

Result: 在物体擦除、艺术风格擦除、名人擦除和显式内容擦除四个任务中，VideoEraser在效果、完整性、保真度、鲁棒性和泛化性方面均优于现有方法，平均减少46%的不良内容生成。

Conclusion: VideoEraser提供了一个有效的训练免费解决方案，能够显著抑制文本到视频生成中的不良内容，为解决扩散模型的安全和伦理问题提供了实用工具。

Abstract: The rapid growth of text-to-video (T2V) diffusion models has raised concerns
about privacy, copyright, and safety due to their potential misuse in
generating harmful or misleading content. These models are often trained on
numerous datasets, including unauthorized personal identities, artistic
creations, and harmful materials, which can lead to uncontrolled production and
distribution of such content. To address this, we propose VideoEraser, a
training-free framework that prevents T2V diffusion models from generating
videos with undesirable concepts, even when explicitly prompted with those
concepts. Designed as a plug-and-play module, VideoEraser can seamlessly
integrate with representative T2V diffusion models via a two-stage process:
Selective Prompt Embedding Adjustment (SPEA) and Adversarial-Resilient Noise
Guidance (ARNG). We conduct extensive evaluations across four tasks, including
object erasure, artistic style erasure, celebrity erasure, and explicit content
erasure. Experimental results show that VideoEraser consistently outperforms
prior methods regarding efficacy, integrity, fidelity, robustness, and
generalizability. Notably, VideoEraser achieves state-of-the-art performance in
suppressing undesirable content during T2V generation, reducing it by 46% on
average across four tasks compared to baselines.

vehicles are now reality in different parts of the world. These vehicles
require sensors and cameras to detect objects and maneuver according to that.
It becomes important to for such vehicles to also predict from a distant if a
person is about to cross a road or not. The current study focused on predicting
the intent of crossing the road by pedestrians in an experimental setup. The
study involved working with deep learning models to predict poses and sequence
modelling for temporal predictions. The study analysed three different sequence
modelling to understand the prediction behaviour and it was found out that GRU
was better in predicting the intent compared to LSTM model but 1D CNN was the
best model in terms of speed. The study involved video analysis, and the output
of pose detection model was integrated later on to sequence modelling
techniques for an end-to-end deep learning framework for predicting road
crossing intents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Video-LLMs研究主要关注性能提升，对其内部工作机制理解有限，需要系统性的实证研究来揭示模型如何处理和理解视频内容。

Method: 采用注意力敲除作为主要分析工具，设计了三种敲除变体：视频时间敲除、视频空间敲除和语言到视频敲除，通过控制敲除层窗口和类型进行全局和细粒度分析。

Result: 发现视频信息提取主要在早期层完成；某些中间层对视频问答有异常大的影响；时空建模更依赖语言引导检索而非视频token间的自注意力机制。

Conclusion: 这些发现可用于减少Video-LLMs的注意力计算，为未来研究提供可解释性和效率方面的见解，是首个系统揭示Video-LLMs内部视频处理机制的工作。

Abstract: Taking advantage of large-scale data and pretrained language models, Video
Large Language Models (Video-LLMs) have shown strong capabilities in answering
video questions. However, most existing efforts focus on improving performance,
with limited attention to understanding their internal mechanisms. This paper
aims to bridge this gap through a systematic empirical study. To interpret
existing VideoLLMs, we adopt attention knockouts as our primary analytical tool
and design three variants: Video Temporal Knockout, Video Spatial Knockout, and
Language-to-Video Knockout. Then, we apply these three knockouts on different
numbers of layers (window of layers). By carefully controlling the window of
layers and types of knockouts, we provide two settings: a global setting and a
fine-grained setting. Our study reveals three key findings: (1) Global setting
indicates Video information extraction primarily occurs in early layers,
forming a clear two-stage process -- lower layers focus on perceptual encoding,
while higher layers handle abstract reasoning; (2) In the fine-grained setting,
certain intermediate layers exert an outsized impact on video question
answering, acting as critical outliers, whereas most other layers contribute
minimally; (3) In both settings, we observe that spatial-temporal modeling
relies more on language-guided retrieval than on intra- and inter-frame
self-attention among video tokens, despite the latter's high computational
cost. Finally, we demonstrate that these insights can be leveraged to reduce
attention computation in Video-LLMs. To our knowledge, this is the first work
to systematically uncover how Video-LLMs internally process and understand
video content, offering interpretability and efficiency perspectives for future
research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统微调方法需要更新所有模型参数，容易导致过拟合和计算成本高。需要一种更高效的迁移学习方法

Method: 使用进化算法识别需要微调的层子集，专注于相关层进行选择性微调

Result: 在9个图像分类数据集上评估，BioTune相比AutoRGN和LoRA等方法实现了竞争性或改进的准确率和效率

Conclusion: 通过集中微调过程在相关层子集上，BioTune减少了可训练参数数量，降低了计算成本，促进了跨不同数据特征的高效迁移学习

Abstract: Deep learning has shown substantial progress in image analysis. However, the
computational demands of large, fully trained models remain a consideration.
Transfer learning offers a strategy for adapting pre-trained models to new
tasks. Traditional fine-tuning often involves updating all model parameters,
which can potentially lead to overfitting and higher computational costs. This
paper introduces BioTune, an evolutionary adaptive fine-tuning technique that
selectively fine-tunes layers to enhance transfer learning efficiency. BioTune
employs an evolutionary algorithm to identify a focused set of layers for
fine-tuning, aiming to optimize model performance on a given target task.
Evaluation across nine image classification datasets from various domains
indicates that BioTune achieves competitive or improved accuracy and efficiency
compared to existing fine-tuning methods such as AutoRGN and LoRA. By
concentrating the fine-tuning process on a subset of relevant layers, BioTune
reduces the number of trainable parameters, potentially leading to decreased
computational cost and facilitating more efficient transfer learning across
diverse data characteristics and distributions.

Motivation: 现有3DGS压缩方法只能压缩到兆字节级别，不适用于大规模场景或场景集合，且缺乏对归档后场景变化的适应机制

Method: 图像条件化高斯溅射量化器，联合利用高斯间和属性间相关性，使用共享码本，编码-量化-解码联合训练，支持基于图像的场景更新

Result: 实验结果表明ICGS-Quantizer在压缩效率和场景变化适应性方面持续优于最先进方法，将存储需求降低到千字节范围

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了3D高斯溅射的压缩效率，同时提供了对归档后场景变化的适应能力，解决了现有方法的两个关键限制

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has attracted considerable attention for
enabling high-quality real-time rendering. Although 3DGS compression methods
have been proposed for deployment on storage-constrained devices, two
limitations hinder archival use: (1) they compress medium-scale scenes only to
the megabyte range, which remains impractical for large-scale scenes or
extensive scene collections; and (2) they lack mechanisms to accommodate scene
changes after long-term archival. To address these limitations, we propose an
Image-Conditioned Gaussian Splat Quantizer (ICGS-Quantizer) that substantially
enhances compression efficiency and provides adaptability to scene changes
after archiving. ICGS-Quantizer improves quantization efficiency by jointly
exploiting inter-Gaussian and inter-attribute correlations and by using shared
codebooks across all training scenes, which are then fixed and applied to
previously unseen test scenes, eliminating the overhead of per-scene codebooks.
This approach effectively reduces the storage requirements for 3DGS to the
kilobyte range while preserving visual fidelity. To enable adaptability to
post-archival scene changes, ICGS-Quantizer conditions scene decoding on images
captured at decoding time. The encoding, quantization, and decoding processes
are trained jointly, ensuring that the codes, which are quantized
representations of the scene, are effective for conditional decoding. We
evaluate ICGS-Quantizer on 3D scene compression and 3D scene updating.
Experimental results show that ICGS-Quantizer consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in compression efficiency and adaptability to scene
changes. Our code, model, and data will be publicly available on GitHub.

TL;DR: DriveSplat是一种基于神经高斯表示的动态-静态解耦方法，用于驾驶场景的高质量3D重建，通过区域体素初始化、可变形神经高斯和深度/法线先验监督，在Waymo和KITTI数据集上实现了最先进的性能。

Motivation: 驾驶场景中存在快速移动的车辆、行人和大规模静态背景，给3D场景重建带来挑战。现有基于3D高斯泼溅的方法在解耦动态静态组件时忽视了背景优化的几何关系，仅通过添加高斯来拟合训练视图，导致新视角渲染鲁棒性有限且几何表示不准确。

Method: 1) 采用区域体素初始化方案，将场景分为近、中、远区域以增强近景细节表示；2) 引入可变形神经高斯建模非刚性动态物体，通过可学习变形网络进行时间参数调整；3) 使用预训练模型的深度和法线先验监督整个框架，提高几何结构准确性。

Conclusion: DriveSplat通过创新的动态-静态解耦策略和几何先验监督，有效解决了驾驶场景3D重建中的运动模糊和几何表示不准确问题，为自动驾驶等应用提供了高质量的场景重建解决方案。

Abstract: In the realm of driving scenarios, the presence of rapidly moving vehicles,
pedestrians in motion, and large-scale static backgrounds poses significant
challenges for 3D scene reconstruction. Recent methods based on 3D Gaussian
Splatting address the motion blur problem by decoupling dynamic and static
components within the scene. However, these decoupling strategies overlook
background optimization with adequate geometry relationships and rely solely on
fitting each training view by adding Gaussians. Therefore, these models exhibit
limited robustness in rendering novel views and lack an accurate geometric
representation. To address the above issues, we introduce DriveSplat, a
high-quality reconstruction method for driving scenarios based on neural
Gaussian representations with dynamic-static decoupling. To better accommodate
the predominantly linear motion patterns of driving viewpoints, a region-wise
voxel initialization scheme is employed, which partitions the scene into near,
middle, and far regions to enhance close-range detail representation.
Deformable neural Gaussians are introduced to model non-rigid dynamic actors,
whose parameters are temporally adjusted by a learnable deformation network.
The entire framework is further supervised by depth and normal priors from
pre-trained models, improving the accuracy of geometric structures. Our method
has been rigorously evaluated on the Waymo and KITTI datasets, demonstrating
state-of-the-art performance in novel-view synthesis for driving scenarios.

Motivation: 当前深度学习模型在抽象推理方面存在根本性瓶颈，Raven渐进矩阵(RPM)被用作评估抽象推理能力的权威基准。论文旨在通过解决RPM问题来增强机器智能的抽象推理能力。

Method: 采用因果链建模视角分析RPM任务的完整因果链，设计了基线模型DIO的网络架构。针对DIO优化目标的局限性，逐步提出了三种改进方法来解决互信息下界紧致性和因果关系捕获的问题。

Conclusion: 论文通过因果链分析揭示了当前方法的局限性，并提出了渐进式的改进方案来更好地解决RPM问题和提升抽象推理能力。

Abstract: Despite the outstanding performance of current deep learning models across
various domains, their fundamental bottleneck in abstract reasoning remains
unresolved. To address this challenge, the academic community has introduced
Raven's Progressive Matrices (RPM) problems as an authoritative benchmark for
evaluating the abstract reasoning capabilities of deep learning algorithms,
with a focus on core intelligence dimensions such as abstract reasoning,
pattern recognition, and complex problem-solving. Therefore, this paper centers
on solving RPM problems, aiming to contribute to enhancing the abstract
reasoning abilities of machine intelligence. Firstly, this paper adopts a
``causal chain modeling'' perspective to systematically analyze the complete
causal chain in RPM tasks: image $\rightarrow$ abstract attributes
$\rightarrow$ progressive attribute patterns $\rightarrow$ pattern consistency
$\rightarrow$ correct answer. Based on this analysis, the network architecture
of the baseline model DIO is designed. However, experiments reveal that the
optimization objective formulated for DIO, namely maximizing the variational
lower bound of mutual information between the context and the correct option,
fails to enable the model to genuinely acquire the predefined human reasoning
logic. This is attributed to two main reasons: the tightness of the lower bound
significantly impacts the effectiveness of mutual information maximization, and
mutual information, as a statistical measure, does not capture the causal
relationship between subjects and objects. To overcome these limitations, this
paper progressively proposes three improvement methods:

Conclusion: SpiVG网络通过结合脉冲神经网络和变分推理，有效提升了视频摘要的信息密度和计算效率，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: With the rise of short video content, efficient video summarization
techniques for extracting key information have become crucial. However,
existing methods struggle to capture the global temporal dependencies and
maintain the semantic coherence of video content. Additionally, these methods
are also influenced by noise during multi-channel feature fusion. We propose a
Spiking Variational Graph (SpiVG) Network, which enhances information density
and reduces computational complexity. First, we design a keyframe extractor
based on Spiking Neural Networks (SNN), leveraging the event-driven computation
mechanism of SNNs to learn keyframe features autonomously. To enable
fine-grained and adaptable reasoning across video frames, we introduce a
Dynamic Aggregation Graph Reasoner, which decouples contextual object
consistency from semantic perspective coherence. We present a Variational
Inference Reconstruction Module to address uncertainty and noise arising during
multi-channel feature fusion. In this module, we employ Evidence Lower Bound
Optimization (ELBO) to capture the latent structure of multi-channel feature
distributions, using posterior distribution regularization to reduce
overfitting. Experimental results show that SpiVG surpasses existing methods
across multiple datasets such as SumMe, TVSum, VideoXum, and QFVS. Our codes

Conclusion: 研究为MAE超参数选择提供了理论指导，有助于在实际应用中更好地选择掩码比例和补丁大小等关键参数。

Abstract: Masked Autoencoders (MAEs) have emerged as a powerful pretraining technique
for vision foundation models. Despite their effectiveness, they require
extensive hyperparameter tuning (masking ratio, patch size, encoder/decoder
layers) when applied to novel datasets. While prior theoretical works have
analyzed MAEs in terms of their attention patterns and hierarchical latent
variable models, the connection between MAE hyperparameters and performance on
downstream tasks is relatively unexplored. This work investigates how MAEs
learn spatial correlations in the input image. We analytically derive the
features learned by a linear MAE and show that masking ratio and patch size can
be used to select for features that capture short- and long-range spatial
correlations. We extend this analysis to non-linear MAEs to show that MAE
representations adapt to spatial correlations in the dataset, beyond
second-order statistics. Finally, we discuss some insights on how to select MAE
hyper-parameters in practice.

Result: 大量实验表明BIRD方法不仅达到最先进性能，而且显示出快速推理速度

Conclusion: BIRD方法通过双向时间信息传播有效解决了红外小目标检测中全局时间信息利用不足的问题，取得了优异性能

Abstract: Moving infrared small target detection is broadly adopted in infrared search
and track systems, and has attracted considerable research focus in recent
years. The existing learning-based multi-frame methods mainly aggregate the
information of adjacent frames in a sliding window fashion to assist the
detection of the current frame. However, the sliding-window-based methods do
not consider joint optimization of the entire video clip and ignore the global
temporal information outside the sliding window, resulting in redundant
computation and sub-optimal performance. In this paper, we propose a
Bidirectional temporal information propagation method for moving InfraRed small
target Detection, dubbed BIRD. The bidirectional propagation strategy
simultaneously utilizes local temporal information of adjacent frames and
global temporal information of past and future frames in a recursive fashion.
Specifically, in the forward and backward propagation branches, we first design
a Local Temporal Motion Fusion (LTMF) module to model local spatio-temporal
dependency between a target frame and its two adjacent frames. Then, a Global
Temporal Motion Fusion (GTMF) module is developed to further aggregate the
global propagation feature with the local fusion feature. Finally, the
bidirectional aggregated features are fused and input into the detection head
for detection. In addition, the entire video clip is jointly optimized by the
traditional detection loss and the additional Spatio-Temporal Fusion (STF)
loss. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed BIRD method not only
achieves the state-of-the-art performance but also shows a fast inference
speed.

Abstract: Conventional car damage inspection techniques are labor-intensive, manual,
and frequently overlook tiny surface imperfections like microscopic dents.
Machine learning provides an innovative solution to the increasing demand for
quicker and more precise inspection methods. The paper uses the YOLOv8 object
recognition framework to provide a deep learning-based solution for
automatically detecting microscopic surface flaws, notably tiny dents, on car
exteriors. Traditional automotive damage inspection procedures are manual,
time-consuming, and frequently unreliable at detecting tiny flaws. To solve
this, a bespoke dataset containing annotated photos of car surfaces under
various lighting circumstances, angles, and textures was created. To improve
robustness, the YOLOv8m model and its customized variants, YOLOv8m-t4 and
YOLOv8m-t42, were trained employing real-time data augmentation approaches.
Experimental results show that the technique has excellent detection accuracy
and low inference latency, making it suited for real-time applications such as
automated insurance evaluations and automobile inspections. Evaluation
parameters such as mean Average Precision (mAP), precision, recall, and
F1-score verified the model's efficacy. With a precision of 0.86, recall of
0.84, and F1-score of 0.85, the YOLOv8m-t42 model outperformed the YOLOv8m-t4
model (precision: 0.81, recall: 0.79, F1-score: 0.80) in identifying
microscopic surface defects. With a little reduced mAP@0.5:0.95 of 0.20, the
mAP@0.5 for YOLOv8m-t42 stabilized at 0.60. Furthermore, YOLOv8m-t42's PR curve
area was 0.88, suggesting more consistent performance than YOLOv8m-t4 (0.82).
YOLOv8m-t42 has greater accuracy and is more appropriate for practical dent
detection applications, even though its convergence is slower.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MATR是一个基于Transformer的视频到视频时刻检索模型，通过双阶段序列对齐和自监督预训练，在ActivityNet-VRL和SportsMoments数据集上显著超越现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频到视频时刻检索任务需要解决语义帧级对齐和建模查询视频与目标视频之间复杂依赖关系的挑战。

Method: 提出MATR模型，使用基于Transformer的双阶段序列对齐来捕获语义上下文和时间细节，结合前景/背景分类和边界预测头，并采用自监督预训练技术。

Result: 在ActivityNet-VRL数据集上R@1提升13.1%，mIoU提升8.1%；在SportsMoments数据集上R@1提升14.7%，mIoU提升14.4%。

Conclusion: MATR通过有效的序列对齐和自监督预训练，在视频到视频时刻检索任务上取得了显著性能提升，证明了其方法的有效性。

Abstract: Video-to-video moment retrieval (Vid2VidMR) is the task of localizing unseen
events or moments in a target video using a query video. This task poses
several challenges, such as the need for semantic frame-level alignment and
modeling complex dependencies between query and target videos. To tackle this
challenging problem, we introduce MATR (Moment Alignment TRansformer), a
transformer-based model designed to capture semantic context as well as the
temporal details necessary for precise moment localization. MATR conditions
target video representations on query video features using dual-stage sequence
alignment that encodes the required correlations and dependencies. These
representations are then used to guide foreground/background classification and
boundary prediction heads, enabling the model to accurately identify moments in
the target video that semantically match with the query video. Additionally, to
provide a strong task-specific initialization for MATR, we propose a
self-supervised pre-training technique that involves training the model to
localize random clips within videos. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
MATR achieves notable performance improvements of 13.1% in R@1 and 8.1% in mIoU
on an absolute scale compared to state-of-the-art methods on the popular
ActivityNet-VRL dataset. Additionally, on our newly proposed dataset,
SportsMoments, MATR shows a 14.7% gain in R@1 and a 14.4% gain in mIoU on an
absolute scale over strong baselines.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需SfM的3D高斯泼溅方法，能够在极稀疏视角输入下联合估计相机位姿和重建3D场景，显著提升渲染质量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3DGS方法严重依赖密集多视角输入和精确相机位姿，但在现实场景中这些条件很难满足。当输入视角极其稀疏时，SfM初始化方法无法准确重建3D几何结构，导致渲染质量下降

Method: 提出密集立体模块逐步估计相机位姿并重建全局密集点云进行初始化；设计一致性视角插值模块生成额外监督信号；引入多尺度拉普拉斯一致性正则化和自适应空间感知多尺度几何正则化

Result: 在极稀疏视角条件下（仅使用2个训练视角），PSNR指标显著提升2.75dB，合成图像失真最小且保留丰富高频细节，视觉质量优于现有技术

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了3DGS在稀疏视角输入下的性能瓶颈，为实际应用提供了可行的解决方案

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated remarkable real-time
performance in novel view synthesis, yet its effectiveness relies heavily on
dense multi-view inputs with precisely known camera poses, which are rarely
available in real-world scenarios. When input views become extremely sparse,
the Structure-from-Motion (SfM) method that 3DGS depends on for initialization
fails to accurately reconstruct the 3D geometric structures of scenes,
resulting in degraded rendering quality. In this paper, we propose a novel
SfM-free 3DGS-based method that jointly estimates camera poses and reconstructs
3D scenes from extremely sparse-view inputs. Specifically, instead of SfM, we
propose a dense stereo module to progressively estimates camera pose
information and reconstructs a global dense point cloud for initialization. To
address the inherent problem of information scarcity in extremely sparse-view
settings, we propose a coherent view interpolation module that interpolates
camera poses based on training view pairs and generates viewpoint-consistent
content as additional supervision signals for training. Furthermore, we
introduce multi-scale Laplacian consistent regularization and adaptive
spatial-aware multi-scale geometry regularization to enhance the quality of
geometrical structures and rendered content. Experiments show that our method
significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art 3DGS-based approaches,
achieving a remarkable 2.75dB improvement in PSNR under extremely sparse-view
conditions (using only 2 training views). The images synthesized by our method
exhibit minimal distortion while preserving rich high-frequency details,
resulting in superior visual quality compared to existing techniques.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究系统评估了三种深度学习人脸检测模型(YOLOv11、YOLOv12、MTCNN)在不同分辨率下的性能表现，发现YOLOv11在高分辨率下精度最优，YOLOv12召回率略好，MTCNN在实时推理速度方面落后。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的低分辨率图像条件对人脸检测性能造成显著挑战，需要系统研究输入分辨率对不同检测模型的影响。

Method: 使用WIDER FACE数据集，在多种图像分辨率(160x160、320x320、640x640)下评估三种主流人脸检测模型，采用精确率、召回率、mAP50、mAP50-95和推理时间等指标。

Result: YOLOv11在高分辨率下检测精度最优，YOLOv12召回率略好，MTCNN在实时推理速度方面表现不佳但在特征点定位方面有竞争力。

Conclusion: 研究结果为根据不同操作约束选择分辨率感知的人脸检测模型提供了实用指导。

Abstract: Face detection is a crucial component in many AI-driven applications such as
surveillance, biometric authentication, and human-computer interaction.
However, real-world conditions like low-resolution imagery present significant
challenges that degrade detection performance. In this study, we systematically
investigate the impact of input resolution on the accuracy and robustness of
three prominent deep learning-based face detectors: YOLOv11, YOLOv12, and
MTCNN. Using the WIDER FACE dataset, we conduct extensive evaluations across
multiple image resolutions (160x160, 320x320, and 640x640) and assess each
model's performance using metrics such as precision, recall, mAP50, mAP50-95,
and inference time. Results indicate that YOLOv11 outperforms YOLOv12 and MTCNN
in terms of detection accuracy, especially at higher resolutions, while YOLOv12
exhibits slightly better recall. MTCNN, although competitive in landmark
localization, lags in real-time inference speed. Our findings provide
actionable insights for selecting resolution-aware face detection models
suitable for varying operational constraints.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LGMSNet是一个轻量级医学图像分割框架，通过局部和全局双多尺度设计，在保持低计算开销的同时实现最先进性能，并在零样本泛化测试中表现优异


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有轻量级模型在医学图像分割中性能与效率的权衡问题，特别是缺乏全局上下文感知能力和通道冗余问题

Method: 采用异构层内卷积核提取局部高频信息并缓解通道冗余，集成稀疏Transformer-卷积混合分支捕获低频全局信息

Result: 在六个公共数据集上超越现有最先进方法，在四个未见数据集上保持优异的零样本泛化性能

Conclusion: LGMSNet具有在资源受限医疗场景中实际部署的潜力，为轻量级医学图像分割提供了有效的解决方案

Abstract: Medical image segmentation plays a pivotal role in disease diagnosis and
treatment planning, particularly in resource-constrained clinical settings
where lightweight and generalizable models are urgently needed. However,
existing lightweight models often compromise performance for efficiency and
rarely adopt computationally expensive attention mechanisms, severely
restricting their global contextual perception capabilities. Additionally,
current architectures neglect the channel redundancy issue under the same
convolutional kernels in medical imaging, which hinders effective feature
extraction. To address these challenges, we propose LGMSNet, a novel
lightweight framework based on local and global dual multiscale that achieves
state-of-the-art performance with minimal computational overhead. LGMSNet
employs heterogeneous intra-layer kernels to extract local high-frequency
information while mitigating channel redundancy. In addition, the model
integrates sparse transformer-convolutional hybrid branches to capture
low-frequency global information. Extensive experiments across six public
datasets demonstrate LGMSNet's superiority over existing state-of-the-art
methods. In particular, LGMSNet maintains exceptional performance in zero-shot
generalization tests on four unseen datasets, underscoring its potential for
real-world deployment in resource-limited medical scenarios. The whole project
code is in https://github.com/cq-dong/LGMSNet.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MExECON是一个从稀疏多视角RGB图像重建穿衣人体三维模型的新方法，通过多视角联合优化提升几何和姿态估计精度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有单视角方法ECON在重建精度上有限，需要利用多视角信息来提升穿衣人体三维重建的几何细节和身体姿态估计准确性

Method: 提出JMBO算法联合优化SMPL-X人体模型，保持多视角一致性；使用优化后的身体模型作为低频先验，通过法线图积分添加几何细节；整合前后视角的法线图来捕捉衣物褶皱和发型等细节

Result: 实验结果表明MExECON相比单视角基线方法在保真度上有显著提升，与当前少样本三维重建方法相比具有竞争力

Conclusion: MExECON成功扩展了单视角方法到多视角场景，无需重新训练网络即可实现多视角增益，为穿衣人体三维重建提供了有效的解决方案

Abstract: This work presents MExECON, a novel pipeline for 3D reconstruction of clothed
human avatars from sparse multi-view RGB images. Building on the single-view
method ECON, MExECON extends its capabilities to leverage multiple viewpoints,
improving geometry and body pose estimation. At the core of the pipeline is the
proposed Joint Multi-view Body Optimization (JMBO) algorithm, which fits a
single SMPL-X body model jointly across all input views, enforcing multi-view
consistency. The optimized body model serves as a low-frequency prior that
guides the subsequent surface reconstruction, where geometric details are added
via normal map integration. MExECON integrates normal maps from both front and
back views to accurately capture fine-grained surface details such as clothing
folds and hairstyles. All multi-view gains are achieved without requiring any
network re-training. Experimental results show that MExECON consistently
improves fidelity over the single-view baseline and achieves competitive
performance compared to modern few-shot 3D reconstruction methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AdaSFFuse是一个新颖的多模态图像融合框架，通过自适应跨域协同融合学习解决模态不对齐、高频细节破坏等问题，在多个融合任务中表现出色且计算效率高。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态图像融合方法面临模态不对齐、高频细节破坏和任务特定限制等挑战，需要一种通用的融合框架来提升图像质量和下游应用效果。

Method: 提出AdaSFFuse框架，包含自适应近似小波变换(AdaWAT)进行频率解耦，以及空间-频率Mamba块进行跨域融合，通过可学习映射动态调整实现鲁棒融合。

Result: 在红外-可见光、多焦点、多曝光和医学图像融合四个任务上的大量实验表明，AdaSFFuse具有优越的融合性能，同时保持低计算成本和紧凑网络结构。

Conclusion: AdaSFFuse通过创新的频率解耦和跨域融合机制，有效提升了多模态图像融合的质量和泛化能力，在性能和效率之间取得了良好平衡。

Abstract: Multimodal Image Fusion (MMIF) aims to integrate complementary information
from different imaging modalities to overcome the limitations of individual
sensors. It enhances image quality and facilitates downstream applications such
as remote sensing, medical diagnostics, and robotics. Despite significant
advancements, current MMIF methods still face challenges such as modality
misalignment, high-frequency detail destruction, and task-specific limitations.
To address these challenges, we propose AdaSFFuse, a novel framework for
task-generalized MMIF through adaptive cross-domain co-fusion learning.
AdaSFFuse introduces two key innovations: the Adaptive Approximate Wavelet
Transform (AdaWAT) for frequency decoupling, and the Spatial-Frequency Mamba
Blocks for efficient multimodal fusion. AdaWAT adaptively separates the high-
and low-frequency components of multimodal images from different scenes,
enabling fine-grained extraction and alignment of distinct frequency
characteristics for each modality. The Spatial-Frequency Mamba Blocks
facilitate cross-domain fusion in both spatial and frequency domains, enhancing
this process. These blocks dynamically adjust through learnable mappings to
ensure robust fusion across diverse modalities. By combining these components,
AdaSFFuse improves the alignment and integration of multimodal features,
reduces frequency loss, and preserves critical details. Extensive experiments
on four MMIF tasks -- Infrared-Visible Image Fusion (IVF), Multi-Focus Image
Fusion (MFF), Multi-Exposure Image Fusion (MEF), and Medical Image Fusion (MIF)
-- demonstrate AdaSFFuse's superior fusion performance, ensuring both low
computational cost and a compact network, offering a strong balance between
performance and efficiency. The code will be publicly available at
https://github.com/Zhen-yu-Liu/AdaSFFuse.

TL;DR: ExtraGS是一个用于自动驾驶场景轨迹外推的框架，结合几何和生成先验，通过创新的高斯表示和自监督不确定性估计，显著提升外推视图的真实性和几何一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的方法利用生成先验作为伪真值，但往往导致几何一致性差和渲染过度平滑的问题，需要一种能够同时保持几何准确性和视觉真实性的解决方案。

Method: 提出ExtraGS框架，包含基于混合高斯-SDF设计的道路表面高斯(RSG)表示、使用可学习缩放因子的远场高斯(FFG)，以及基于球谐函数的自监督不确定性估计框架来选择性地集成生成先验。

Result: 在多个数据集、多样化多相机设置和各种生成先验上的广泛实验表明，ExtraGS显著提升了外推视图的真实性和几何一致性，同时在原始轨迹上保持高保真度。

Conclusion: ExtraGS通过整合几何和生成先验的创新方法，有效解决了自动驾驶场景外推视图合成中的关键挑战，为模拟驾驶场景提供了更高质量的解决方案。

Abstract: Synthesizing extrapolated views from recorded driving logs is critical for
simulating driving scenes for autonomous driving vehicles, yet it remains a
challenging task. Recent methods leverage generative priors as pseudo ground
truth, but often lead to poor geometric consistency and over-smoothed
renderings. To address these limitations, we propose ExtraGS, a holistic
framework for trajectory extrapolation that integrates both geometric and
generative priors. At the core of ExtraGS is a novel Road Surface Gaussian(RSG)
representation based on a hybrid Gaussian-Signed Distance Function (SDF)
design, and Far Field Gaussians (FFG) that use learnable scaling factors to
efficiently handle distant objects. Furthermore, we develop a self-supervised
uncertainty estimation framework based on spherical harmonics that enables
selective integration of generative priors only where extrapolation artifacts
occur. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets, diverse multi-camera setups,
and various generative priors demonstrate that ExtraGS significantly enhances
the realism and geometric consistency of extrapolated views, while preserving
high fidelity along the original trajectory.

TL;DR: GroupSketch是一种新颖的矢量草图动画方法，通过两阶段流程（运动初始化和运动细化）有效处理多对象交互和复杂运动，解决了现有方法的时间不一致性和泛化能力差的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有草图动画方法在处理多对象交互和复杂运动时存在局限，要么仅限于单对象情况，要么存在时间不一致性和泛化能力差的问题，需要一种能够有效处理这些复杂场景的方法。

Method: 采用两阶段流程：1）运动初始化阶段交互式分割语义组并定义关键帧，通过插值生成粗略动画；2）运动细化阶段使用基于组的位移网络（GDN）预测组特定位移场，利用文本到视频模型的先验，并包含上下文条件特征增强（CCFE）等专门模块来提高时间一致性。

Result: 大量实验表明，该方法在生成高质量、时间一致的多对象复杂草图动画方面显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: GroupSketch方法成功扩展了草图动画的实际应用范围，能够有效处理复杂的多对象交互场景，生成高质量的动画效果。

Abstract: We introduce GroupSketch, a novel method for vector sketch animation that
effectively handles multi-object interactions and complex motions. Existing
approaches struggle with these scenarios, either being limited to single-object
cases or suffering from temporal inconsistency and poor generalization. To
address these limitations, our method adopts a two-stage pipeline comprising
Motion Initialization and Motion Refinement. In the first stage, the input
sketch is interactively divided into semantic groups and key frames are
defined, enabling the generation of a coarse animation via interpolation. In
the second stage, we propose a Group-based Displacement Network (GDN), which
refines the coarse animation by predicting group-specific displacement fields,
leveraging priors from a text-to-video model. GDN further incorporates
specialized modules, such as Context-conditioned Feature Enhancement (CCFE), to
improve temporal consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
approach significantly outperforms existing methods in generating high-quality,
temporally consistent animations for complex, multi-object sketches, thus
expanding the practical applications of sketch animation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: D3FNet是一个用于高分辨率遥感图像中细粒度窄路分割的扩张双流差分注意力融合网络，通过创新的注意力机制和双流解码策略，在窄路提取任务上取得了优异性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高分辨率遥感图像中的窄路提取面临宽度有限、拓扑结构碎片化和频繁遮挡等挑战，传统模型容易过拟合到通用道路宽度，无法有效处理细粒度、遮挡和低对比度的道路段。

Method: 基于D-LinkNet编码器-解码器架构，提出三个关键创新：1）差分注意力扩张提取模块增强细微道路特征；2）双流解码融合机制平衡空间精度和语义上下文；3）多尺度扩张策略减少网格伪影并改善连续性。

Result: 在DeepGlobe和CHN6-CUG基准测试中，D3FNet在具有挑战性的道路区域实现了优异的IoU和召回率，超越了最先进的基线方法。消融研究验证了注意力引导编码和双路径解码的互补协同作用。

Conclusion: D3FNet被证实为复杂遥感和协同感知场景中细粒度窄路提取的鲁棒解决方案，特别适用于处理遮挡和低对比度的道路段。

Abstract: Extracting narrow roads from high-resolution remote sensing imagery remains a
significant challenge due to their limited width, fragmented topology, and
frequent occlusions. To address these issues, we propose D3FNet, a Dilated
Dual-Stream Differential Attention Fusion Network designed for fine-grained
road structure segmentation in remote perception systems. Built upon the
encoder-decoder backbone of D-LinkNet, D3FNet introduces three key
innovations:(1) a Differential Attention Dilation Extraction (DADE) module that
enhances subtle road features while suppressing background noise at the
bottleneck; (2) a Dual-stream Decoding Fusion Mechanism (DDFM) that integrates
original and attention-modulated features to balance spatial precision with
semantic context; and (3) a multi-scale dilation strategy (rates 1, 3, 5, 9)
that mitigates gridding artifacts and improves continuity in narrow road
prediction. Unlike conventional models that overfit to generic road widths,
D3FNet specifically targets fine-grained, occluded, and low-contrast road
segments. Extensive experiments on the DeepGlobe and CHN6-CUG benchmarks show
that D3FNet achieves superior IoU and recall on challenging road regions,
outperforming state-of-the-art baselines. Ablation studies further verify the
complementary synergy of attention-guided encoding and dual-path decoding.
These results confirm D3FNet as a robust solution for fine-grained narrow road
extraction in complex remote and cooperative perception scenarios.

TL;DR: ADAPT是一种无需反向传播的测试时自适应方法，通过高斯概率推理建模类别条件似然，利用CLIP先验和历史知识库进行轻量级正则化，在多种分布偏移下实现最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有测试时自适应方法存在两个主要问题：1）依赖反向传播或迭代优化，限制了可扩展性和实时部署；2）缺乏对类别条件特征分布的显式建模，导致决策边界不可靠和预测校准不足。

Method: 将测试时自适应重构为高斯概率推理任务，使用逐渐更新的类别均值和共享协方差矩阵建模类别条件似然，实现闭式、无训练推理。引入基于CLIP先验和历史知识库的轻量级正则化来纠正潜在似然偏差。

Result: 在多种基准测试上的广泛实验表明，该方法在广泛的分布偏移下实现了最先进的性能，具有优越的可扩展性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: ADAPT方法无需源数据、梯度更新或完整访问目标数据，支持在线和转导设置，为测试时自适应提供了高效可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Test-time adaptation (TTA) enhances the zero-shot robustness under
distribution shifts by leveraging unlabeled test data during inference. Despite
notable advances, several challenges still limit its broader applicability.
First, most methods rely on backpropagation or iterative optimization, which
limits scalability and hinders real-time deployment. Second, they lack explicit
modeling of class-conditional feature distributions. This modeling is crucial
for producing reliable decision boundaries and calibrated predictions, but it
remains underexplored due to the lack of both source data and supervision at
test time. In this paper, we propose ADAPT, an Advanced Distribution-Aware and
backPropagation-free Test-time adaptation method. We reframe TTA as a Gaussian
probabilistic inference task by modeling class-conditional likelihoods using
gradually updated class means and a shared covariance matrix. This enables
closed-form, training-free inference. To correct potential likelihood bias, we
introduce lightweight regularization guided by CLIP priors and a historical
knowledge bank. ADAPT requires no source data, no gradient updates, and no full
access to target data, supporting both online and transductive settings.
Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks demonstrate that our method
achieves state-of-the-art performance under a wide range of distribution shifts
with superior scalability and robustness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 隐式神经表示(INRs)存在频谱偏差问题，倾向于学习低频分量而难以捕捉高频细节如锐利边缘和精细纹理

Method: 采用两阶段训练策略：第一阶段使用邻居感知软掩码对局部变化强烈的像素赋予更高权重，引导模型早期关注高频细节；第二阶段进行全图像训练

Result: 实验结果表明该方法能持续改善重建质量，并与现有INR方法形成互补

Conclusion: 作为首个在图像INR中为像素分配频率感知重要性的尝试，为缓解频谱偏差问题提供了新途径

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) have emerged as a powerful alternative
to traditional pixel-based formats by modeling images as continuous functions
over spatial coordinates. A key challenge, however, lies in the spectral bias
of neural networks, which tend to favor low-frequency components while
struggling to capture high-frequency (HF) details such as sharp edges and fine
textures. While prior approaches have addressed this limitation through
architectural modifications or specialized activation functions, we propose an
orthogonal direction by directly guiding the training process. Specifically, we
introduce a two-stage training strategy where a neighbor-aware soft mask
adaptively assigns higher weights to pixels with strong local variations,
encouraging early focus on fine details. The model then transitions to
full-image training. Experimental results show that our approach consistently
improves reconstruction quality and complements existing INR methods. As a
pioneering attempt to assign frequency-aware importance to pixels in image INR,
our work offers a new avenue for mitigating the spectral bias problem.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管截断最小二乘(TLS)能够承受达95%的离群点，但求解这个组合优化问题到全局最优极其困难，现有的半正定规划方法需要数百秒时间。

Method: 提出了新的线性时间凸杰缩编方法，以及一种缩编器方法来加速分支限界(BnB)算法。这个法在知道旋转轴时可以解决仅旋转的TLS问题。

Result: 该法能够在半秒内完成100个点的3D点云注册，速度比当前最好的SDP法STRIDE快两个数量级。还通过对抗性实例验证了全局最优性。

Conclusion: 该方法虽然目前无法解决完整6DoF问题，但在旋转仅TLS问题上实现了量级的速度提升，并能够提供可供证明的全局最优解。

Abstract: Recent results showed that point cloud registration with given
correspondences can be made robust to outlier rates of up to 95\% using the
truncated least squares (TLS) formulation. However, solving this combinatorial
optimization problem to global optimality is challenging. Provably globally
optimal approaches using semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxations take
hundreds of seconds for 100 points. In this paper, we propose a novel linear
time convex relaxation as well as a contractor method to speed up Branch and
Bound (BnB). Our solver can register two 3D point clouds with 100 points to
provable global optimality in less than half a second when the axis of rotation
is provided. Although it currently cannot solve the full 6DoF problem, it is
two orders of magnitude faster than the state-of-the-art SDP solver STRIDE when
solving the rotation-only TLS problem. In addition to providing a formal proof
for global optimality, we present empirical evidence of global optimality using
adversarial instances with local minimas close to the global minimum.

effective for detecting objects in camera trap imagery. Drone based thermal
imagery, analyzed with an enhanced Faster RCNN model, added a complementary
aerial viewpoint for camera trap detections. Spatial pattern analysis
identified clear hotspots for both wildlife and human activities and their
overlapping patterns within certain areas in the CNP and buffer zones
indicating potential conflict. This study reveals human wildlife conflicts

*Pengcheng Fang,Yuxia Chen,Rui Guo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Grounded VideoDiT是一个视频大语言模型，通过扩散时间潜在编码器、对象接地表示和混合令牌方案，显著提升了视频时间感知和实体交互理解能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频LLM在时间感知方面存在局限：时间戳编码隐式、帧级特征连续性差、语言视觉对齐漂移，需要更精细的时间推理能力。

Method: 提出三个关键创新：1）扩散时间潜在编码器增强边界敏感性和时间一致性；2）对象接地表示显式绑定查询实体与视觉证据；3）混合令牌方案提供显式时间戳建模。

Result: 在Charades STA、NExT GQA和多个VideoQA基准测试中取得了最先进的性能表现。

Conclusion: Grounded VideoDiT通过创新的时间建模和实体接地机制，为视频理解提供了强大的时间感知和实体交互推理能力。

Abstract: Understanding videos requires more than answering open ended questions, it
demands the ability to pinpoint when events occur and how entities interact
across time. While recent Video LLMs have achieved remarkable progress in
holistic reasoning, they remain coarse in temporal perception: timestamps are
encoded only implicitly, frame level features are weak in capturing continuity,
and language vision alignment often drifts from the entities of interest. In
this paper, we present Grounded VideoDiT, a Video LLM designed to overcome
these limitations by introducing three key innovations. First, a Diffusion
Temporal Latent (DTL) encoder enhances boundary sensitivity and maintains
temporal consistency. Second, object grounded representations explicitly bind
query entities to localized visual evidence, strengthening alignment. Third, a
mixed token scheme with discrete temporal tokens provides explicit timestamp
modeling, enabling fine grained temporal reasoning. Together, these designs
equip Grounded VideoDiT with robust grounding capabilities, as validated by
state of the art results on Charades STA, NExT GQA, and multiple VideoQA
benchmarks.

TL;DR: 提出了一种弱监督方法，通过人工质量评估标签训练评分模型，然后利用评分模型的反馈来微调分割模型，显著提高了树木实例识别的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机载激光扫描数据中的树木实例分割对森林监测至关重要，但面临数据变化大和精确标注数据获取成本高的问题。

Method: 使用非微调模型或闭式算法获得初始分割结果，由人工操作员进行质量评级，然后训练评分模型对分割输出进行分类，最后利用评分模型的反馈微调分割模型。

Result: 原始分割模型的正确识别树木实例数量提高了34%，同时显著减少了非树木实例的预测数量。

Conclusion: 该方法在稀疏林区和小树木（高度小于2米）或复杂环境（包含灌木、岩石等）中仍存在挑战，这些情况下方法性能会降低。

Abstract: Tree instance segmentation of airborne laser scanning (ALS) data is of utmost
importance for forest monitoring, but remains challenging due to variations in
the data caused by factors such as sensor resolution, vegetation state at
acquisition time, terrain characteristics, etc. Moreover, obtaining a
sufficient amount of precisely labeled data to train fully supervised instance
segmentation methods is expensive. To address these challenges, we propose a
weakly supervised approach where labels of an initial segmentation result
obtained either by a non-finetuned model or a closed form algorithm are
provided as a quality rating by a human operator. The labels produced during
the quality assessment are then used to train a rating model, whose task is to
classify a segmentation output into the same classes as specified by the human
operator. Finally, the segmentation model is finetuned using feedback from the
rating model. This in turn improves the original segmentation model by 34\% in
terms of correctly identified tree instances while considerably reducing the
number of non-tree instances predicted. Challenges still remain in data over
sparsely forested regions characterized by small trees (less than two meters in
height) or within complex surroundings containing shrubs, boulders, etc. which
can be confused as trees where the performance of the proposed method is
reduced.

TL;DR: 提出CFG方法，通过关键特征引导提升3D点云对抗样本的迁移性，在黑盒攻击中无需目标模型信息，在多个基准数据集上显著优于现有方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实场景中难以获取目标模型信息，现有3D对抗攻击方法依赖模型参数或输出，需要开发不依赖目标模型信息的迁移攻击方法

Method: 基于关键特征一致性的观察，提出关键特征引导(CFG)方法，通过计算特征重要性来正则化对抗点云搜索，优先破坏不同架构可能采用的关键特征，并在损失函数中约束最大偏差以确保不可感知性

Result: 在ModelNet40和ScanObjectNN基准数据集上的大量实验表明，CFG方法大幅优于最先进的攻击方法

Conclusion: CFG方法通过关键特征引导有效提升了3D点云对抗样本的迁移性，为黑盒攻击场景提供了有效的解决方案

Abstract: Deep neural networks for 3D point clouds have been demonstrated to be
vulnerable to adversarial examples. Previous 3D adversarial attack methods
often exploit certain information about the target models, such as model
parameters or outputs, to generate adversarial point clouds. However, in
realistic scenarios, it is challenging to obtain any information about the
target models under conditions of absolute security. Therefore, we focus on
transfer-based attacks, where generating adversarial point clouds does not
require any information about the target models. Based on our observation that
the critical features used for point cloud classification are consistent across
different DNN architectures, we propose CFG, a novel transfer-based black-box
attack method that improves the transferability of adversarial point clouds via
the proposed Critical Feature Guidance. Specifically, our method regularizes
the search of adversarial point clouds by computing the importance of the
extracted features, prioritizing the corruption of critical features that are
likely to be adopted by diverse architectures. Further, we explicitly constrain
the maximum deviation extent of the generated adversarial point clouds in the
loss function to ensure their imperceptibility. Extensive experiments conducted
on the ModelNet40 and ScanObjectNN benchmark datasets demonstrate that the
proposed CFG outperforms the state-of-the-art attack methods by a large margin.

Motivation: 现有在线高精地图构建方法依赖离线地图先验和多模态传感器，导致推理时计算开销大且依赖过时的离线地图信息。

Method: 提出Teacher-Coach-Student三阶段知识蒸馏框架，包含多模态教师模型、视觉教练模型和轻量学生模型，并引入TGPD和MSRD两种蒸馏策略进行特征对齐和语义学习指导。

Result: 在nuScenes数据集上，学生模型的mIoU提升+6.68，mAP提升+10.94，同时推理速度加快。

Conclusion: MapKD框架有效解决了跨模态知识转移问题，实现了高性能、低成本的纯视觉在线高精地图构建方案。

Abstract: Online HD map construction is a fundamental task in autonomous driving
systems, aiming to acquire semantic information of map elements around the ego
vehicle based on real-time sensor inputs. Recently, several approaches have
achieved promising results by incorporating offline priors such as SD maps and
HD maps or by fusing multi-modal data. However, these methods depend on stale
offline maps and multi-modal sensor suites, resulting in avoidable
computational overhead at inference. To address these limitations, we employ a
knowledge distillation strategy to transfer knowledge from multimodal models
with prior knowledge to an efficient, low-cost, and vision-centric student
model. Specifically, we propose MapKD, a novel multi-level cross-modal
knowledge distillation framework with an innovative Teacher-Coach-Student (TCS)
paradigm. This framework consists of: (1) a camera-LiDAR fusion model with
SD/HD map priors serving as the teacher; (2) a vision-centric coach model with
prior knowledge and simulated LiDAR to bridge the cross-modal knowledge
transfer gap; and (3) a lightweight vision-based student model. Additionally,
we introduce two targeted knowledge distillation strategies: Token-Guided 2D
Patch Distillation (TGPD) for bird's eye view feature alignment and Masked
Semantic Response Distillation (MSRD) for semantic learning guidance. Extensive
experiments on the challenging nuScenes dataset demonstrate that MapKD improves
the student model by +6.68 mIoU and +10.94 mAP while simultaneously
accelerating inference speed. The code is available

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LoD1和LoD2建筑模型缺乏详细的立面元素，而LoD3模型虽然包含这些细节但需要手动建模，难以大规模应用。需要自动化方法来高效生成LoD3模型

Method: 利用光线到模型先验分析获得的冲突图(CMs)，开发语义冲突图生成器(SCMG)生成合成CMs，通过语义分割真实和合成CMs，并结合纹理模型的分割结果进行置信度融合

Result: 实验结果表明CM2LoD3方法在建筑开口分割和重建方面有效，通过不确定性感知的纹理分割融合达到61%的性能

Conclusion: 该方法推动了自动化LoD3模型重建的进展，为可扩展和高效的三维城市建模铺平了道路

Abstract: Detailed 3D building models are crucial for urban planning, digital twins,
and disaster management applications. While Level of Detail 1 (LoD)1 and LoD2
building models are widely available, they lack detailed facade elements
essential for advanced urban analysis. In contrast, LoD3 models address this
limitation by incorporating facade elements such as windows, doors, and
underpasses. However, their generation has traditionally required manual
modeling, making large-scale adoption challenging. In this contribution,
CM2LoD3, we present a novel method for reconstructing LoD3 building models
leveraging Conflict Maps (CMs) obtained from ray-to-model-prior analysis.
Unlike previous works, we concentrate on semantically segmenting real-world CMs
with synthetically generated CMs from our developed Semantic Conflict Map
Generator (SCMG). We also observe that additional segmentation of textured
models can be fused with CMs using confidence scores to further increase
segmentation performance and thus increase 3D reconstruction accuracy.
Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our CM2LoD3 method in
segmenting and reconstructing building openings, with the 61% performance with
uncertainty-aware fusion of segmented building textures. This research
contributes to the advancement of automated LoD3 model reconstruction, paving
the way for scalable and efficient 3D city modeling. Our project is available:

TL;DR: 提出了MDPR框架，通过多维动态提示路由解决VLM在类别不平衡场景下的微调偏差问题，在多个长尾基准测试中达到SOTA性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练视觉语言模型(VLMs)在类别不平衡场景下微调时存在偏差，现有方法忽略了VLM预训练中固有的类别不平衡问题，导致下游任务中的偏差积累

Method: 构建包含五个视觉语义维度的综合知识库，采用动态路由机制对齐全局视觉类别、检索最优提示、平衡细粒度语义，并通过logits融合获得稳定预测

Result: 在CIFAR-LT、ImageNet-LT和Places-LT等长尾基准测试中取得了与当前SOTA方法相当的结果，动态路由计算开销极小

Conclusion: MDPR为数据不平衡下的VLM微调提供了一个灵活高效的增强方案，语义库对尾部类别特别有效

Abstract: Pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, have demonstrated
impressive capability in visual tasks, but their fine-tuning often suffers from
bias in class-imbalanced scene. Recent works have introduced large language
models (LLMs) to enhance VLM fine-tuning with supplementing semantic
information. However, they often overlook inherent class imbalance in VLMs'
pre-training, which may lead to bias accumulation in downstream tasks. To
address this problem, this paper proposes a Multi-dimensional Dynamic Prompt
Routing (MDPR) framework. MDPR constructs a comprehensive knowledge base for
classes, spanning five visual-semantic dimensions. During fine-tuning, the
dynamic routing mechanism aligns global visual classes, retrieves optimal
prompts, and balances fine-grained semantics, yielding stable predictions
through logits fusion. Extensive experiments on long-tailed benchmarks,
including CIFAR-LT, ImageNet-LT, and Places-LT, demonstrate that MDPR achieves
comparable results with current SOTA methods. Ablation studies further confirm
the effectiveness of our semantic library for tail classes, and show that our
dynamic routing incurs minimal computational overhead, making MDPR a flexible
and efficient enhancement for VLM fine-tuning under data imbalance.

TL;DR: StreamMem是一种查询无关的KV缓存内存机制，用于流式视频理解，通过注意力分数压缩视觉token和通用查询token之间的KV缓存，在内存受限的长视频场景中实现高效问答。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在处理长视频时面临内存和计算开销大的问题，现有视觉压缩方法需要预先编码整个视觉上下文或提前获取问题，这在长视频理解和多轮对话场景中不实用。

Method: 提出StreamMem方法，以流式方式编码新视频帧，使用视觉token和通用查询token之间的注意力分数压缩KV缓存，并维护固定大小的KV内存。

Result: 在三个长视频理解和两个流式视频问答基准测试中，StreamMem在查询无关的KV缓存压缩方面达到最先进性能，并与查询感知压缩方法相竞争。

Conclusion: StreamMem提供了一种高效的流式视频理解解决方案，能够在内存受限环境下处理长视频问答任务，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have made significant progress in
visual-language reasoning, but their ability to efficiently handle long videos
remains limited. Despite recent advances in long-context MLLMs, storing and
attending to the key-value (KV) cache for long visual contexts incurs
substantial memory and computational overhead. Existing visual compression
methods require either encoding the entire visual context before compression or
having access to the questions in advance, which is impractical for long video
understanding and multi-turn conversational settings. In this work, we propose
StreamMem, a query-agnostic KV cache memory mechanism for streaming video
understanding. Specifically, StreamMem encodes new video frames in a streaming
manner, compressing the KV cache using attention scores between visual tokens
and generic query tokens, while maintaining a fixed-size KV memory to enable
efficient question answering (QA) in memory-constrained, long-video scenarios.
Evaluation on three long video understanding and two streaming video question
answering benchmarks shows that StreamMem achieves state-of-the-art performance
in query-agnostic KV cache compression and is competitive with query-aware
compression approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前生成视频建模方法主要依赖RGB信号，在长序列中会出现对象结构和运动的累积错误，需要解决时间一致性和结构保持的问题。

Method: 提出WorldWeaver框架，联合预测感知条件和颜色信息；利用深度线索构建记忆库；采用分段噪声调度训练预测组。

Result: 在扩散模型和整流流模型上的大量实验表明，WorldWeaver能有效减少时间漂移，提高生成视频的保真度。

Conclusion: WorldWeaver通过统一的长期建模方案，在长视频生成中实现了更好的时间一致性和结构保持，为生成视频建模提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Generative video modeling has made significant strides, yet ensuring
structural and temporal consistency over long sequences remains a challenge.
Current methods predominantly rely on RGB signals, leading to accumulated
errors in object structure and motion over extended durations. To address these
issues, we introduce WorldWeaver, a robust framework for long video generation
that jointly models RGB frames and perceptual conditions within a unified
long-horizon modeling scheme. Our training framework offers three key
advantages. First, by jointly predicting perceptual conditions and color
information from a unified representation, it significantly enhances temporal
consistency and motion dynamics. Second, by leveraging depth cues, which we
observe to be more resistant to drift than RGB, we construct a memory bank that
preserves clearer contextual information, improving quality in long-horizon
video generation. Third, we employ segmented noise scheduling for training
prediction groups, which further mitigates drift and reduces computational
cost. Extensive experiments on both diffusion- and rectified flow-based models
demonstrate the effectiveness of WorldWeaver in reducing temporal drift and
improving the fidelity of generated videos.

Motivation: 现有的视觉基础模型在细粒度语义分割（如特定细胞亚型识别）方面存在挑战，需要减少像素级标注需求并提高分割准确性。

Method: 采用全栈方法：1)分子赋能的标注减少详细标注需求；2)SAM适配器增强语义特异性；3)分子导向校正学习(MOCL)提升分割精度。

Abstract: Purpose: Recent developments in computational pathology have been driven by
advances in Vision Foundation Models, particularly the Segment Anything Model
(SAM). This model facilitates nuclei segmentation through two primary methods:
prompt-based zero-shot segmentation and the use of cell-specific SAM models for
direct segmentation. These approaches enable effective segmentation across a
range of nuclei and cells. However, general vision foundation models often face
challenges with fine-grained semantic segmentation, such as identifying
specific nuclei subtypes or particular cells. Approach: In this paper, we
propose the molecular-empowered All-in-SAM Model to advance computational
pathology by leveraging the capabilities of vision foundation models. This
model incorporates a full-stack approach, focusing on: (1) annotation-engaging
lay annotators through molecular-empowered learning to reduce the need for
detailed pixel-level annotations, (2) learning-adapting the SAM model to
emphasize specific semantics, which utilizes its strong generalizability with
SAM adapter, and (3) refinement-enhancing segmentation accuracy by integrating
Molecular-Oriented Corrective Learning (MOCL). Results: Experimental results
from both in-house and public datasets show that the All-in-SAM model
significantly improves cell classification performance, even when faced with
varying annotation quality. Conclusions: Our approach not only reduces the
workload for annotators but also extends the accessibility of precise
biomedical image analysis to resource-limited settings, thereby advancing
medical diagnostics and automating pathology image analysis.

from 5 to 10 seconds at a native resolution of 720p, which are subsequently
upscaled to 1080p. The model simultaneously supports text-to-video (T2V),
image-to-video (I2V), and text-to-image (T2I) generation within a single,
integrated framework. We introduce a Hybrid Stream DiT architecture to enhance
modality alignment and accelerate training convergence. To ensure training data
quality, we establish a comprehensive data curation pipeline and manually
annotate and train an MLLM-based video quality model to filter for the
highest-quality samples. Furthermore, we provide detailed training and
inference recipes to facilitate the generation of high-quality videos. Building
on these contributions, Waver excels at capturing complex motion, achieving

Motivation: 现有参数化人体模型在捕捉多样化姿态和形状细节方面存在困难，主要由于训练数据多样性有限和建模假设限制，且传统方法中内部骨骼与外部软组织之间存在问题依赖关系。

Method: 使用240个同步相机捕获的60万高分辨率扫描数据，通过将网格表示基于人体骨骼来显式解耦形状和骨骼基础，采用非线性姿态校正方法。

Conclusion: ATLAS通过骨骼基础的解耦方法实现了增强的形状表达能力、细粒度身体属性定制以及独立于外部软组织特征的关键点拟合，显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Parametric body models offer expressive 3D representation of humans across a
wide range of poses, shapes, and facial expressions, typically derived by
learning a basis over registered 3D meshes. However, existing human mesh
modeling approaches struggle to capture detailed variations across diverse body
poses and shapes, largely due to limited training data diversity and
restrictive modeling assumptions. Moreover, the common paradigm first optimizes
the external body surface using a linear basis, then regresses internal
skeletal joints from surface vertices. This approach introduces problematic
dependencies between internal skeleton and outer soft tissue, limiting direct
control over body height and bone lengths. To address these issues, we present
ATLAS, a high-fidelity body model learned from 600k high-resolution scans
captured using 240 synchronized cameras. Unlike previous methods, we explicitly
decouple the shape and skeleton bases by grounding our mesh representation in
the human skeleton. This decoupling enables enhanced shape expressivity,
fine-grained customization of body attributes, and keypoint fitting independent
of external soft-tissue characteristics. ATLAS outperforms existing methods by
fitting unseen subjects in diverse poses more accurately, and quantitative
evaluations show that our non-linear pose correctives more effectively capture
complex poses compared to linear models.

Abstract: 3D content generation has recently attracted significant research interest
due to its applications in VR/AR and embodied AI. In this work, we address the
challenging task of synthesizing multiple 3D assets within a single scene
image. Concretely, our contributions are fourfold: (i) we present SceneGen, a
novel framework that takes a scene image and corresponding object masks as
input, simultaneously producing multiple 3D assets with geometry and texture.
Notably, SceneGen operates with no need for optimization or asset retrieval;
(ii) we introduce a novel feature aggregation module that integrates local and
global scene information from visual and geometric encoders within the feature
extraction module. Coupled with a position head, this enables the generation of
3D assets and their relative spatial positions in a single feedforward pass;
(iii) we demonstrate SceneGen's direct extensibility to multi-image input
scenarios. Despite being trained solely on single-image inputs, our
architectural design enables improved generation performance with multi-image
inputs; and (iv) extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations confirm the
efficiency and robust generation abilities of our approach. We believe this
paradigm offers a novel solution for high-quality 3D content generation,
potentially advancing its practical applications in downstream tasks. The code

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have brought remarkable visual fidelity
to instruction-guided image editing. However, their global denoising process
inherently entangles the edited region with the entire image context, leading
to unintended spurious modifications and compromised adherence to editing
instructions. In contrast, autoregressive models offer a distinct paradigm by
formulating image synthesis as a sequential process over discrete visual
tokens. Their causal and compositional mechanism naturally circumvents the
adherence challenges of diffusion-based methods. In this paper, we present
VAREdit, a visual autoregressive (VAR) framework that reframes image editing as
a next-scale prediction problem. Conditioned on source image features and text
instructions, VAREdit generates multi-scale target features to achieve precise
edits. A core challenge in this paradigm is how to effectively condition the
source image tokens. We observe that finest-scale source features cannot

gap, we introduce a Scale-Aligned Reference (SAR) module, which injects
scale-matched conditioning information into the first self-attention layer.

TL;DR: 提出了一种可扩展的组推理方法，通过将组推理建模为二次整数分配问题，在提升样本质量的同时最大化组内多样性，解决了独立采样导致的冗余问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统生成模型独立采样导致输出冗余，限制了用户选择和创意探索。在实际应用中，用户通常需要一组多样化的输出结果。

Method: 将组推理建模为二次整数分配问题：候选输出作为图节点，通过优化样本质量（一元项）和最大化组多样性（二元项）来选择子集。采用渐进式剪枝候选集的方法提高运行效率。

Result: 实验表明该方法相比独立采样基线和最新推理算法，显著提升了组的多样性和质量。

Conclusion: 该框架可广泛应用于文本到图像、图像到图像、图像提示和视频生成等任务，使生成模型能够将多个输出视为有凝聚力的组而非独立样本。

Abstract: Generative models typically sample outputs independently, and recent
inference-time guidance and scaling algorithms focus on improving the quality
of individual samples. However, in real-world applications, users are often
presented with a set of multiple images (e.g., 4-8) for each prompt, where
independent sampling tends to lead to redundant results, limiting user choices
and hindering idea exploration. In this work, we introduce a scalable group
inference method that improves both the diversity and quality of a group of
samples. We formulate group inference as a quadratic integer assignment
problem: candidate outputs are modeled as graph nodes, and a subset is selected
to optimize sample quality (unary term) while maximizing group diversity
(binary term). To substantially improve runtime efficiency, we progressively
prune the candidate set using intermediate predictions, allowing our method to
scale up to large candidate sets. Extensive experiments show that our method
significantly improves group diversity and quality compared to independent
sampling baselines and recent inference algorithms. Our framework generalizes
across a wide range of tasks, including text-to-image, image-to-image, image
prompting, and video generation, enabling generative models to treat multiple
outputs as cohesive groups rather than independent samples.

Motivation: 现有视觉扩散模型由于训练分辨率有限和计算资源约束，难以生成高质量的高分辨率图像和视频，容易出现重复模式问题

Method: 提出针对不同类型视频生成架构的专用变体，基于最先进的开源视频生成框架，实现高分辨率I2V和V2V合成

Conclusion: CineScale成功解决了高分辨率视觉生成中的重复模式问题，显著提升了生成质量，为高分辨率视觉内容生成提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Visual diffusion models achieve remarkable progress, yet they are typically
trained at limited resolutions due to the lack of high-resolution data and
constrained computation resources, hampering their ability to generate
high-fidelity images or videos at higher resolutions. Recent efforts have
explored tuning-free strategies to exhibit the untapped potential
higher-resolution visual generation of pre-trained models. However, these
methods are still prone to producing low-quality visual content with repetitive
patterns. The key obstacle lies in the inevitable increase in high-frequency
information when the model generates visual content exceeding its training
resolution, leading to undesirable repetitive patterns deriving from the
accumulated errors. In this work, we propose CineScale, a novel inference
paradigm to enable higher-resolution visual generation. To tackle the various
issues introduced by the two types of video generation architectures, we
propose dedicated variants tailored to each. Unlike existing baseline methods
that are confined to high-resolution T2I and T2V generation, CineScale broadens
the scope by enabling high-resolution I2V and V2V synthesis, built atop
state-of-the-art open-source video generation frameworks. Extensive experiments
validate the superiority of our paradigm in extending the capabilities of
higher-resolution visual generation for both image and video models.
Remarkably, our approach enables 8k image generation without any fine-tuning,
and achieves 4k video generation with only minimal LoRA fine-tuning. Generated
video samples are available at our website:

Conclusion: DeepNaniNet能够在数据稀疏、冷启动严重的环境中提供高质量、保护隐私的推荐，同时有效整合异构内容源。

Abstract: Recommender systems for niche and dynamic communities face persistent
challenges from data sparsity, cold start users and items, and privacy
constraints. Traditional collaborative filtering and content-based approaches
underperform in these settings, either requiring invasive user data or failing
when preference histories are absent. We present DeepNaniNet, a deep neural
recommendation framework that addresses these challenges through an inductive
graph-based architecture combining user-item interactions, item-item relations,
and rich textual review embeddings derived from BERT. Our design enables cold
start recommendations without profile mining, using a novel "content basket"
user representation and an autoencoder-based generalization strategy for unseen
users. We introduce AnimeULike, a new dataset of 10,000 anime titles and 13,000
users, to evaluate performance in realistic scenarios with high proportions of
guest or low-activity users. DeepNaniNet achieves state-of-the-art cold start
results on the CiteULike benchmark, matches DropoutNet in user recall without
performance degradation for out-of-matrix users, and outperforms Weighted
Matrix Factorization (WMF) and DropoutNet on AnimeULike warm start by up to 7x
and 1.5x in Recall@100, respectively. Our findings demonstrate that DeepNaniNet
delivers high-quality, privacy-preserving recommendations in data-sparse, cold
start-heavy environments while effectively integrating heterogeneous content
sources.

Conclusion: 该研究提出了一个结合变分量子计算和深度学习的创新框架，能够处理现实世界数据集，性能与纯经典方法相当。模型在噪声配置下表现良好，展示了稳定的性能，为推荐系统的未来应用提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Quantum computing, with its ability to do exponentially faster computation
compared to classical systems, has found novel applications in various fields
such as machine learning and recommendation systems. Quantum Machine Learning
(QML), which integrates quantum computing with machine learning techniques,
presents powerful new tools for data processing and pattern recognition. This
paper proposes a hybrid recommendation system that combines Quantum Hopfield
Associative Memory (QHAM) with deep neural networks to improve the extraction
and classification on the MovieLens 1M dataset. User archetypes are clustered
into multiple unique groups using the K-Means algorithm and converted into
polar patterns through the encoder's activation function. These polar patterns
are then integrated into the variational QHAM-based hybrid recommendation
model. The system was trained using the MSE loss over 35 epochs in an ideal
environment, achieving an ROC value of 0.9795, an accuracy of 0.8841, and an
F-1 Score of 0.8786. Trained with the same number of epochs in a noisy
environment using a custom Qiskit AER noise model incorporating bit-flip and
readout errors with the same probabilities as in real quantum hardware, it
achieves an ROC of 0.9177, an accuracy of 0.8013, and an F-1 Score equal to
0.7866, demonstrating consistent performance.
  Additionally, we were able to optimize the qubit overhead present in previous
QHAM architectures by efficiently updating only one random targeted qubit. This
research presents a novel framework that combines variational quantum computing
with deep learning, capable of dealing with real-world datasets with comparable
performance compared to purely classical counterparts. Additionally, the model
can perform similarly well in noisy configurations, showcasing a steady
performance and proposing a promising direction for future usage in
recommendation systems.

Conclusion: 通过引入协作感知的标记化和高效的生成架构，成功解决了生成式推荐系统的关键限制，为生成式推荐系统提供了实用的解决方案

Abstract: Recent work has explored generative recommender systems as an alternative to
traditional ID-based models, reframing item recommendation as a sequence
generation task over discrete item tokens. While promising, such methods often
underperform in practice compared to well-tuned ID-based baselines like SASRec.
In this paper, we identify two key limitations holding back generative
approaches: the lack of collaborative signal in item tokenization, and
inefficiencies in the commonly used encoder-decoder architecture. To address
these issues, we introduce COSETTE, a contrastive tokenization method that
integrates collaborative information directly into the learned item
representations, jointly optimizing for both content reconstruction and
recommendation relevance. Additionally, we propose MARIUS, a lightweight,
audio-inspired generative model that decouples timeline modeling from item
decoding. MARIUS reduces inference cost while improving recommendation
accuracy. Experiments on standard sequential recommendation benchmarks show
that our approach narrows, or even eliminates, the performance gap between
generative and modern ID-based models, while retaining the benefits of the
generative paradigm.

Conclusion: 该框架为推荐系统提供了更灵活有效的范式，通过成对比较和效用优化更好地捕捉用户真实偏好

Abstract: Recommender systems play a critical role in enhancing user experience by
providing personalized suggestions based on user preferences. Traditional
approaches often rely on explicit numerical ratings or assume access to fully
ranked lists of items. However, ratings frequently fail to capture true
preferences due to users' behavioral biases and subjective interpretations of
rating scales, while eliciting full rankings is demanding and impractical. To
overcome these limitations, we propose a generalized utility-based framework
that learns preferences from simple and intuitive pairwise comparisons. Our
approach is model-agnostic and designed to optimize for arbitrary,
task-specific utility functions, allowing the system's objective to be
explicitly aligned with the definition of a high-quality outcome in any given
application. A central contribution of our work is a novel utility-based active
sampling strategy for preference elicitation. This method selects queries that
are expected to provide the greatest improvement to the utility of the final
recommended outcome. We ground our preference model in the probabilistic
Plackett-Luce framework for pairwise data. To demonstrate the versatility of
our approach, we present two distinct experiments: first, an implementation
using matrix factorization for a classic movie recommendation task, and second,
an implementation using a neural network for a complex candidate selection
scenario in university admissions. Experimental results demonstrate that our
framework provides a more accurate, data-efficient, and user-centric paradigm
for personalized ranking.

Conclusion: MSPA通过多模态自校正偏好对齐，有效解决了直播推荐中用户动态偏好与作者多模态属性的匹配问题，提升了推荐性能和可解释性

Abstract: With the rapid growth of live streaming platforms, personalized
recommendation systems have become pivotal in improving user experience and
driving platform revenue. The dynamic and multimodal nature of live streaming
content (e.g., visual, audio, textual data) requires joint modeling of user
behavior and multimodal features to capture evolving author characteristics.
However, traditional methods relying on single-modal features or treating
multimodal ones as supplementary struggle to align users' dynamic preferences
with authors' multimodal attributes, limiting accuracy and interpretability. To
address this, we propose MSPA (Multimodal Self-Corrective Preference
Alignment), a personalized author recommendation framework with two components:
(1) a Multimodal Preference Composer that uses MLLMs to generate structured
preference text and embeddings from users' tipping history; and (2) a
Self-Corrective Preference Alignment Recommender that aligns these preferences
with authors' multimodal features to improve accuracy and interpretability.
Extensive experiments and visualizations show that MSPA significantly improves
accuracy, recall, and text quality, outperforming baselines in dynamic live
streaming scenarios.

Abstract: Recommendation systems have been essential for both user experience and
platform efficiency by alleviating information overload and supporting
decision-making. Traditional methods, i.e., content-based filtering,
collaborative filtering, and deep learning, have achieved impressive results in
recommendation systems. However, the cold-start and sparse-data scenarios are
still challenging to deal with. Existing solutions either generate
pseudo-interaction sequence, which often introduces redundant or noisy signals,
or rely heavily on semantic similarity, overlooking dynamic shifts in user
motivation. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a novel
recommendation framework, termed M-$LLM^3$REC, which leverages large language
models for deep motivational signal extraction from limited user interactions.
M-$LLM^3$REC comprises three integrated modules: the Motivation-Oriented
Profile Extractor (MOPE), Motivation-Oriented Trait Encoder (MOTE), and
Motivational Alignment Recommender (MAR). By emphasizing motivation-driven
semantic modeling, M-$LLM^3$REC demonstrates robust, personalized, and
generalizable recommendations, particularly boosting performance in cold-start
situations in comparison with the state-of-the-art frameworks.

Abstract: Approximate unlearning for session-based recommendation refers to eliminating
the influence of specific training samples from the recommender without
retraining of (sub-)models. Gradient ascent (GA) is a representative method to
conduct approximate unlearning. However, there still exist dual challenges to
apply GA for session-based recommendation. On the one hand, naive applying of
GA could lead to degradation of recommendation performance. On the other hand,
existing studies fail to consider the ordering of unlearning samples when
simultaneously processing multiple unlearning requests, leading to sub-optimal
recommendation performance and unlearning effect. To address the above
challenges, we introduce CAU, a curriculum approximate unlearning framework
tailored to session-based recommendation. CAU handles the unlearning task with
a GA term on unlearning samples. Specifically, to address the first challenge,
CAU formulates the overall optimization task as a multi-objective optimization
problem, where the GA term for unlearning samples is combined with retaining
terms for preserving performance. The multi-objective optimization problem is
solved through seeking the Pareto-Optimal solution, which achieves effective
unlearning with trivial sacrifice on recommendation performance. To tackle the
second challenge, CAU adopts a curriculum-based sequence to conduct unlearning
on batches of unlearning samples. The key motivation is to perform unlearning
from easy samples to harder ones. To this end, CAU first introduces two metrics
to measure the unlearning difficulty, including gradient unlearning difficulty
and embedding unlearning difficulty. Then, two strategies, hard-sampling and
soft-sampling, are proposed to select unlearning samples according to
difficulty scores.

Conclusion: MMQ框架成功解决了语义ID在推荐系统中的关键挑战，实现了多模态信息的有效利用和行为偏好的精准对齐

Abstract: Recommender systems traditionally represent items using unique identifiers
(ItemIDs), but this approach struggles with large, dynamic item corpora and
sparse long-tail data, limiting scalability and generalization. Semantic IDs,
derived from multimodal content such as text and images, offer a promising
alternative by mapping items into a shared semantic space, enabling knowledge
transfer and improving recommendations for new or rare items. However, existing
methods face two key challenges: (1) balancing cross-modal synergy with
modality-specific uniqueness, and (2) bridging the semantic-behavioral gap,
where semantic representations may misalign with actual user preferences. To
address these challenges, we propose Multimodal Mixture-of-Quantization (MMQ),
a two-stage framework that trains a novel multimodal tokenizer. First, a
shared-specific tokenizer leverages a multi-expert architecture with
modality-specific and modality-shared experts, using orthogonal regularization
to capture comprehensive multimodal information. Second, behavior-aware
fine-tuning dynamically adapts semantic IDs to downstream recommendation
objectives while preserving modality information through a multimodal
reconstruction loss. Extensive offline experiments and online A/B tests
demonstrate that MMQ effectively unifies multimodal synergy, specificity, and
behavioral adaptation, providing a scalable and versatile solution for both
generative retrieval and discriminative ranking tasks.

Conclusion: FSAP构成了对神经检索系统的现实且可扩展的威胁，能有效跨专有和开源大语言模型泛化

Abstract: While neural ranking models (NRMs) have shown high effectiveness, they remain
susceptible to adversarial manipulation. In this work, we introduce Few-Shot
Adversarial Prompting (FSAP), a novel black-box attack framework that leverages
the in-context learning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to
generate high-ranking adversarial documents. Unlike previous approaches that
rely on token-level perturbations or manual rewriting of existing documents,
FSAP formulates adversarial attacks entirely through few-shot prompting,
requiring no gradient access or internal model instrumentation. By conditioning
the LLM on a small support set of previously observed harmful examples, FSAP
synthesizes grammatically fluent and topically coherent documents that subtly
embed false or misleading information and rank competitively against authentic
content. We instantiate FSAP in two modes: FSAP-IntraQ, which leverages harmful
examples from the same query to enhance topic fidelity, and FSAP-InterQ, which
enables broader generalization by transferring adversarial patterns across
unrelated queries. Our experiments on the TREC 2020 and 2021 Health
Misinformation Tracks, using four diverse neural ranking models, reveal that
FSAP-generated documents consistently outrank credible, factually accurate
documents. Furthermore, our analysis demonstrates that these adversarial
outputs exhibit strong stance alignment and low detectability, posing a
realistic and scalable threat to neural retrieval systems. FSAP also
effectively generalizes across both proprietary and open-source LLMs.

Abstract: Multimodal recommendation typically combines the user behavioral data with
the modal features of items to reveal user's preference, presenting superior
performance compared to the conventional recommendations. However, existing
methods still suffer from two key problems: (1) the initialization methods of
user multimodal representations are either behavior-unperceived or
noise-contaminated, and (2) the KNN-based item-item graph contains noisy edges
with low similarities and lacks audience co-occurrence relationships. To
address such issues, we propose MLLMRec, a novel MLLM-driven multimodal
recommendation framework with two item-item graph refinement strategies. On the
one hand, the item images are first converted into high-quality semantic
descriptions using an MLLM, which are then fused with the textual metadata of
items. Then, we construct a behavioral description list for each user and feed
it into the MLLM to reason about the purified user preference containing
interaction motivations. On the other hand, we design the threshold-controlled
denoising and topology-aware enhancement strategies to refine the suboptimal
item-item graph, thereby enhancing the item representation learning. Extensive
experiments on three publicly available datasets demonstrate that MLLMRec
achieves the state-of-the-art performance with an average improvement of 38.53%
over the best baselines.

Conclusion: REG4Rec通过多语义路径推理和自反思机制有效解决了生成式推荐中的推理单一性和可靠性问题，为大规模推荐系统提供了高性能的解决方案。

Abstract: Sequential recommendation aims to predict a user's next action in large-scale
recommender systems. While traditional methods often suffer from insufficient
information interaction, recent generative recommendation models partially
address this issue by directly generating item predictions. To better capture
user intents, recent studies have introduced a reasoning process into
generative recommendation, significantly improving recommendation performance.
However, these approaches are constrained by the singularity of item semantic
representations, facing challenges such as limited diversity in reasoning
pathways and insufficient reliability in the reasoning process. To tackle these
issues, we introduce REG4Rec, a reasoning-enhanced generative model that
constructs multiple dynamic semantic reasoning paths alongside a
self-reflection process, ensuring high-confidence recommendations.
Specifically, REG4Rec utilizes an MoE-based parallel quantization codebook
(MPQ) to generate multiple unordered semantic tokens for each item, thereby
constructing a larger-scale diverse reasoning space. Furthermore, to enhance
the reliability of reasoning, we propose a training reasoning enhancement
stage, which includes Preference Alignment for Reasoning (PARS) and a
Multi-Step Reward Augmentation (MSRA) strategy. PARS uses reward functions
tailored for recommendation to enhance reasoning and reflection, while MSRA
introduces future multi-step actions to improve overall generalization. During
inference, Consistency-Oriented Self-Reflection for Pruning (CORP) is proposed
to discard inconsistent reasoning paths, preventing the propagation of
erroneous reasoning. Lastly, we develop an efficient offline training strategy
for large-scale recommendation. Experiments on real-world datasets and online
evaluations show that REG4Rec delivers outstanding performance and substantial
practical value.

TL;DR: DiffuMIN是一个基于扩散模型的多兴趣网络，用于长序列用户行为建模，通过正交分解和扩散生成来探索完整的用户兴趣空间，在CTR预测任务中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的两阶段模型在长序列用户行为建模中往往过滤掉重要信息，无法捕捉多样化的用户兴趣和构建完整的用户兴趣潜在空间。

Method: 提出目标导向的多兴趣提取方法：1）正交分解目标获得兴趣通道；2）建模兴趣通道与用户行为关系来解耦多兴趣；3）采用上下文兴趣和兴趣通道引导的扩散模块生成增强兴趣；4）利用对比学习确保生成兴趣符合用户真实偏好。

Conclusion: DiffuMIN通过扩散驱动的多兴趣建模方法，有效解决了长序列用户行为建模中的信息丢失问题，能够更全面地探索用户兴趣空间，显著提升了CTR预测性能。

Abstract: CTR (Click-Through Rate) prediction, crucial for recommender systems and
online advertising, etc., has been confirmed to benefit from modeling long-term
user behaviors. Nonetheless, the vast number of behaviors and complexity of
noise interference pose challenges to prediction efficiency and effectiveness.
Recent solutions have evolved from single-stage models to two-stage models.
However, current two-stage models often filter out significant information,
resulting in an inability to capture diverse user interests and build the
complete latent space of user interests. Inspired by multi-interest and
generative modeling, we propose DiffuMIN (Diffusion-driven Multi-Interest
Network) to model long-term user behaviors and thoroughly explore the user
interest space. Specifically, we propose a target-oriented multi-interest
extraction method that begins by orthogonally decomposing the target to obtain
interest channels. This is followed by modeling the relationships between
interest channels and user behaviors to disentangle and extract multiple user
interests. We then adopt a diffusion module guided by contextual interests and
interest channels, which anchor users' personalized and target-oriented
interest types, enabling the generation of augmented interests that align with
the latent spaces of user interests, thereby further exploring restricted
interest space. Finally, we leverage contrastive learning to ensure that the
generated augmented interests align with users' genuine preferences. Extensive
offline experiments are conducted on two public datasets and one industrial
dataset, yielding results that demonstrate the superiority of DiffuMIN.
Moreover, DiffuMIN increased CTR by 1.52% and CPM by 1.10% in online A/B
testing. Our source code is available at

Motivation: 当前CTR模型性能提升遇到瓶颈，受大语言模型缩放定律启发，希望通过模型扩展和知识蒸馏来提升CTR预测性能

Method: 构建SUAN模型使用UAB编码器统一建模序列和非序列特征，堆叠UAB提升模型等级；通过稀疏自注意力和并行推理构建LightSUAN，采用在线蒸馏从高等级SUAN教师模型训练轻量级模型

Result: SUAN在模型等级和数据规模上展现缩放定律，蒸馏后的LightSUAN性能优于高一级的SUAN，在线部署使CTR提升2.81%，CPM提升1.69%

Conclusion: 提出的SUAN和蒸馏框架有效解决了CTR模型性能瓶颈问题，实现了高性能与低推理时间的平衡，具有实际部署价值

Abstract: CTR models play a vital role in improving user experience and boosting
business revenue in many online personalized services. However, current CTR
models generally encounter bottlenecks in performance improvement. Inspired by
the scaling law phenomenon of LLMs, we propose a new paradigm for improving CTR
predictions: first, constructing a CTR model with accuracy scalable to the
model grade and data size, and then distilling the knowledge implied in this
model into its lightweight model that can serve online users. To put it into
practice, we construct a CTR model named SUAN (Stacked Unified Attention
Network). In SUAN, we propose the UAB as a behavior sequence encoder. A single
UAB unifies the modeling of the sequential and non-sequential features and also
measures the importance of each user behavior feature from multiple
perspectives. Stacked UABs elevate the configuration to a high grade, paving
the way for performance improvement. In order to benefit from the high
performance of the high-grade SUAN and avoid the disadvantage of its long
inference time, we modify the SUAN with sparse self-attention and parallel
inference strategies to form LightSUAN, and then adopt online distillation to
train the low-grade LightSUAN, taking a high-grade SUAN as a teacher. The
distilled LightSUAN has superior performance but the same inference time as the
LightSUAN, making it well-suited for online deployment. Experimental results
show that SUAN performs exceptionally well and holds the scaling laws spanning
three orders of magnitude in model grade and data size, and the distilled
LightSUAN outperforms the SUAN configured with one grade higher. More
importantly, the distilled LightSUAN has been integrated into an online
service, increasing the CTR by 2.81% and CPM by 1.69% while keeping the average
inference time acceptable. Our source code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在推荐系统中存在幻觉问题，其思维链推理的有效性无法保证，需要提升LLMs在推荐任务中的推理能力。

Method: 设计TrackRec框架，包含RecCoT生成器(G)和验证器(V)，通过交替反馈学习机制：G通过V的反馈进行直接偏好优化生成准确RecCoT，V通过G的推理反馈进行微调提升验证能力。

Result: 大量实验证明该方法超越最先进方法，已在亿级用户广告平台部署并取得显著收益。

Conclusion: TrackRec通过生成器和验证器的交替反馈学习，有效提升了LLMs在推荐系统中的推理能力和推荐效果。

Abstract: The extensive world knowledge and powerful reasoning capabilities of large
language models (LLMs) have attracted significant attention in recommendation
systems (RS). Specifically, The chain of thought (CoT) has been shown to
improve the performance of LLMs on complex reasoning tasks for RS. However, due
to the fact that LLMs often suffer from hallucination issues, there is no
guarantee that their reasoning CoT is effective. A key challenge is to further
enhance the recommendation capabilities of LLMs through effective CoT
reasonings. Therefore, we propose \textbf{TrackRec}, a framework designed to
enhance reasoning capabilities of LLMs for RS. TrackRec specifically focuses on
accurately inferring recommendation CoT \textbf{(RecCoT)} for user preference
using the knowledge from LLMs. This RecCoT can serve both as an explanation for
the LLM's completion of recommendation tasks and as auxiliary features to
assist recommendation models in accomplishing recommendation tasks. TrackRec
consists of a RecCoT generator $(G)$ and a RecCoT validator $(V)$. Furthermore,
we design alternating feedback learning mechanism that $G$ undergoes direct
preference optimization via feedback from $V$ to produce increasingly accurate
RecCoT aligned with $V$'s standards. Meanwhile, $V$ is fine-tuned using the
inference feedback from $G$ to enhance its validation capabilities in alignment
with recommendation tasks. Through iterative alternating feedback learning
between $G$ and $V$, TrackRec continuously improves the user preference
analysis capability of $G$ and the validation capacity of $V$. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, showing that it
surpasses state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, TrackRec has been deployed on a
lagre advertising platform with hundreds of millions of users, achieving
substantial gains.

Abstract: We present the first systematic investigation of graph reordering effects for
graph-based Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search (ANNS) on a GPU. While
graph-based ANNS has become the dominant paradigm for modern AI applications,
recent approaches focus on algorithmic innovations while neglecting memory
layout considerations that significantly affect execution time. Our unified
evaluation framework enables comprehensive evaluation of diverse reordering
strategies across different graph indices through a graph adapter that converts
arbitrary graph topologies into a common representation and a GPU-optimized
graph traversal engine. We conduct a comprehensive analysis across diverse
datasets and state-of-the-art graph indices, introducing analysis metrics that
quantify the relationship between structural properties and memory layout
effectiveness. Our GPU-targeted reordering achieves up to 15$\%$ QPS
improvements while preserving search accuracy, demonstrating that memory layout
optimization operates orthogonally to existing algorithmic innovations. We will
release all code upon publication to facilitate reproducibility and foster
further research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RAG框架将检索和推理作为孤立组件处理，在需要迭代证据收集或高精度检索的复杂任务中存在性能限制。近期研究开始通过引入反馈机制来缩小这一差距。

Method: 对集成反馈的高级检索排序机制进行结构化综述，根据反馈信号的来源和作用（改进查询、检索上下文或文档池）进行分类整理。

Result: 系统总结了信息检索和NLP社区在自适应检索和排序方法方面的最新进展，提供了反馈机制的分类框架。

Conclusion: 通过整合这些发展，旨在促进检索作为端到端RAG系统中动态可学习组件的认知，为构建更高效的RAG系统提供理论指导。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a standard framework for
knowledge-intensive NLP tasks, combining large language models (LLMs) with
document retrieval from external corpora. Despite its widespread use, most RAG
pipelines continue to treat retrieval and reasoning as isolated components,
retrieving documents once and then generating answers without further
interaction. This static design often limits performance on complex tasks that
require iterative evidence gathering or high-precision retrieval. Recent work
in both the information retrieval (IR) and NLP communities has begun to close
this gap by introducing adaptive retrieval and ranking methods that incorporate
feedback. In this survey, we present a structured overview of advanced
retrieval and ranking mechanisms that integrate such feedback. We categorize
feedback signals based on their source and role in improving the query,
retrieved context, or document pool. By consolidating these developments, we
aim to bridge IR and NLP perspectives and highlight retrieval as a dynamic,
learnable component of end-to-end RAG systems.

TL;DR: 本文首次系统评估了多模态实体链接模型在视觉对抗攻击下的鲁棒性，发现现有模型普遍缺乏足够的抗干扰能力，并提出了一种基于大语言模型和检索增强的解决方案LLM-RetLink，显著提升了模型在对抗条件下的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着多模态数据的爆炸式增长，多模态实体链接(MEL)模型快速发展，但现有研究尚未系统探讨视觉对抗攻击对MEL模型的影响，需要填补这一研究空白。

Method: 采用两阶段方法：首先使用大型视觉模型提取初始实体描述，然后通过基于网络的检索动态生成候选描述句子，构建LLM-RetLink模型来增强抗干扰能力。

Result: 在五个数据集上的实验表明，LLM-RetLink将MEL准确率提高了0.4%-35.7%，在对抗条件下表现出显著优势，并构建发布了首个MEL对抗样本数据集。

Conclusion: 本研究揭示了MEL鲁棒性中一个未被探索的方面，为未来加强多模态系统在对抗环境中的韧性奠定了基础，证明了上下文语义信息可以部分缓解对抗扰动的影响。

Abstract: The explosive growth of multimodal data has driven the rapid development of
multimodal entity linking (MEL) models. However, existing studies have not
systematically investigated the impact of visual adversarial attacks on MEL
models. We conduct the first comprehensive evaluation of the robustness of
mainstream MEL models under different adversarial attack scenarios, covering
two core tasks: Image-to-Text (I2T) and Image+Text-to-Text (IT2T). Experimental
results show that current MEL models generally lack sufficient robustness
against visual perturbations. Interestingly, contextual semantic information in
input can partially mitigate the impact of adversarial perturbations. Based on
this insight, we propose an LLM and Retrieval-Augmented Entity Linking
(LLM-RetLink), which significantly improves the model's anti-interference
ability through a two-stage process: first, extracting initial entity
descriptions using large vision models (LVMs), and then dynamically generating
candidate descriptive sentences via web-based retrieval. Experiments on five
datasets demonstrate that LLM-RetLink improves the accuracy of MEL by
0.4%-35.7%, especially showing significant advantages under adversarial
conditions. This research highlights a previously unexplored facet of MEL
robustness, constructs and releases the first MEL adversarial example dataset,
and sets the stage for future work aimed at strengthening the resilience of
multimodal systems in adversarial environments.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了图书推荐系统中的主题偏见问题，发现内容不平衡和用户参与模式会放大偏见，导致小众兴趣用户获得较少个性化推荐，而多样化兴趣用户获得更一致的推荐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 推荐系统虽然帮助用户发现新内容，但也会强化现有偏见，导致不公平曝光和多样性减少。本文旨在调查图书推荐中的主题偏见问题。

Method: 采用多阶段偏见评估框架，使用Book-Crossing数据集评估推荐中的主题偏见及其对不同用户群体的影响。

Result: 研究发现主题偏见源于内容不平衡，并被用户参与模式放大。小众和长尾兴趣用户获得的个性化推荐较少，而多样化兴趣用户获得更一致的推荐。

Conclusion: 推荐系统应精心设计以容纳更广泛的用户兴趣，这项工作为将主题偏见分析扩展到其他领域奠定了基础，有助于实现负责任AI的更大目标。

Abstract: Recommender systems help users discover new content, but can also reinforce
existing biases, leading to unfair exposure and reduced diversity. This paper
introduces and investigates thematic bias in book recommendations, defined as a
disproportionate favouring or neglect of certain book themes. We adopt a
multi-stage bias evaluation framework using the Book-Crossing dataset to
evaluate thematic bias in recommendations and its impact on different user
groups.
  Our findings show that thematic bias originates from content imbalances and
is amplified by user engagement patterns. By segmenting users based on their
thematic preferences, we find that users with niche and long-tail interests
receive less personalised recommendations, whereas users with diverse interests
receive more consistent recommendations. These findings suggest that
recommender systems should be carefully designed to accommodate a broader range
of user interests. By contributing to the broader goal of responsible AI, this
work also lays the groundwork for extending thematic bias analysis to other
domains.

Abstract: Autonomous vehicles hold great promise for reducing traffic fatalities and
improving transportation efficiency, yet their widespread adoption hinges on
embedding robust ethical reasoning into routine and emergency maneuvers. Here,
we present a hierarchical Safe Reinforcement Learning (Safe RL) framework that
explicitly integrates moral considerations with standard driving objectives. At
the decision level, a Safe RL agent is trained using a composite ethical risk
cost, combining collision probability and harm severity, to generate high-level
motion targets. A dynamic Prioritized Experience Replay mechanism amplifies
learning from rare but critical, high-risk events. At the execution level,
polynomial path planning coupled with Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID)
and Stanley controllers translates these targets into smooth, feasible
trajectories, ensuring both accuracy and comfort. We train and validate our
approach on rich, real-world traffic datasets encompassing diverse vehicles,
cyclists, and pedestrians, and demonstrate that it outperforms baseline methods
in reducing ethical risk and maintaining driving performance. To our knowledge,
this is the first study of ethical decision-making for autonomous vehicles via
Safe RL in real-world scenarios. Our results highlight the potential of
combining formal control theory and data-driven learning to advance ethically
accountable autonomy in complex, human-mixed traffic environments.

Method: 使用生成平衡算子(GEOs)和有限维深度平衡层，处理可分离希尔伯特空间中的凸优化问题，输入为光滑凸损失函数，输出为对应的近似解。

Conclusion: GEOs方法成功弥合了神经算子理论与实践的差距，为无限维空间中的算子学习问题提供了高效的解决方案，参数复杂度仅为对数增长。

Abstract: Neural operators (NOs) are a class of deep learning models designed to
simultaneously solve infinitely many related problems by casting them into an
infinite-dimensional space, whereon these NOs operate. A significant gap
remains between theory and practice: worst-case parameter bounds from universal
approximation theorems suggest that NOs may require an unrealistically large
number of parameters to solve most operator learning problems, which stands in
direct opposition to a slew of experimental evidence. This paper closes that
gap for a specific class of {NOs}, generative {equilibrium operators} (GEOs),
using (realistic) finite-dimensional deep equilibrium layers, when solving
families of convex optimization problems over a separable Hilbert space $X$.
Here, the inputs are smooth, convex loss functions on $X$, and outputs are the
associated (approximate) solutions to the optimization problem defined by each
input loss.
  We show that when the input losses lie in suitable infinite-dimensional
compact sets, our GEO can uniformly approximate the corresponding solutions to
arbitrary precision, with rank, depth, and width growing only logarithmically
in the reciprocal of the approximation error. We then validate both our
theoretical results and the trainability of GEOs on three applications: (1)
nonlinear PDEs, (2) stochastic optimal control problems, and (3) hedging
problems in mathematical finance under liquidity constraints.

Motivation: 由于不同病人群体和临床环境存在显著差异，没有单一模型能在所有群体中都表现最佳，需要个性化的风险预测方案

Method: 两阶段流程：1）使用FAISS相似性搜索在9个多样化真实世界群体中找到最相似的病人群体；2）用LLM分析找到的群体和其性能指标，从8个代表性模型中推荐最优预测算法

Result: 设计了一个动态、群体感知的风险预测系统，能够根据每个病人的特征个性化选择最合适的预测模型

Conclusion: 该两阶段代理流程提供了一种灵活的、群体驱动的模型选择方案，为真实世界肺癌筛查中的个体化风险评估提供了实用路径

Abstract: Accurate lung cancer risk prediction remains challenging due to substantial
variability across patient populations and clinical settings -- no single model
performs best for all cohorts. To address this, we propose a personalized lung
cancer risk prediction agent that dynamically selects the most appropriate
model for each patient by combining cohort-specific knowledge with modern
retrieval and reasoning techniques. Given a patient's CT scan and structured
metadata -- including demographic, clinical, and nodule-level features -- the
agent first performs cohort retrieval using FAISS-based similarity search
across nine diverse real-world cohorts to identify the most relevant patient
population from a multi-institutional database. Second, a Large Language Model
(LLM) is prompted with the retrieved cohort and its associated performance
metrics to recommend the optimal prediction algorithm from a pool of eight
representative models, including classical linear risk models (e.g., Mayo,
Brock), temporally-aware models (e.g., TDVIT, DLSTM), and multi-modal computer
vision-based approaches (e.g., Liao, Sybil, DLS, DLI). This two-stage agent
pipeline -- retrieval via FAISS and reasoning via LLM -- enables dynamic,
cohort-aware risk prediction personalized to each patient's profile. Building
on this architecture, the agent supports flexible and cohort-driven model
selection across diverse clinical populations, offering a practical path toward
individualized risk assessment in real-world lung cancer screening.

Motivation: DeepONet的输出相对于分支网络最后一层参数是线性的，这些参数可以用最小二乘法优化，但直接求解所有分支和主干输入组合的大型线性系统计算量过大

Method: 将大型LS系统分解为分支网络和主干网络两个更小的子问题分别求解，并推广到包含正则化项的L2损失函数，包括物理信息无监督学习

Result: 该方法能够有效处理原本计算不可行的大型线性问题，提高了训练效率

Conclusion: 提出的混合优化方法为DeepONet训练提供了计算高效的解决方案，特别适用于包含物理信息损失的无监督学习场景

Abstract: We propose an efficient hybrid least squares/gradient descent method to
accelerate DeepONet training. Since the output of DeepONet can be viewed as
linear with respect to the last layer parameters of the branch network, these
parameters can be optimized using a least squares (LS) solve, and the remaining
hidden layer parameters are updated by means of gradient descent form. However,
building the LS system for all possible combinations of branch and trunk inputs
yields a prohibitively large linear problem that is infeasible to solve
directly. To address this issue, our method decomposes the large LS system into
two smaller, more manageable subproblems $\unicode{x2014}$ one for the branch
network and one for the trunk network $\unicode{x2014}$ and solves them
separately. This method is generalized to a broader type of $L^2$ loss with a
regularization term for the last layer parameters, including the case of
unsupervised learning with physics-informed loss.

structural perception and temporal modeling. The method leverages graph neural
networks to model the structural relationships among multimodal clinical
symptoms and introduces graph-based representations to capture semantic
dependencies between symptoms. It also incorporates a Transformer architecture
to model dynamic temporal features during disease progression. To fuse
structural and temporal information, a structure-aware gating mechanism is
designed to dynamically adjust the fusion weights between structural encodings
and temporal features, enhancing the model's ability to identify key
progression stages. To improve classification accuracy and stability, the
framework includes a multi-component modeling pipeline, consisting of a graph
construction module, a temporal encoding module, and a prediction output layer.
The model is evaluated on real-world longitudinal Parkinson's disease data. The
experiments involve comparisons with mainstream models, sensitivity analysis of
hyperparameters, and graph connection density control. Results show that the
proposed method outperforms existing approaches in AUC, RMSE, and IPW-F1
metrics. It effectively distinguishes progression stages and improves the
model's ability to capture personalized symptom trajectories. The overall
framework demonstrates strong generalization and structural scalability,
providing reliable support for intelligent modeling of chronic progressive
diseases such as Parkinson's disease.

TL;DR: 提出HHNAS-AM方法，通过分层混合架构搜索和自适应变异策略，有效解决文本分类中NAS搜索空间过大和冗余的问题，在Spider数据集上测试准确率提升8%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有NAS模型在文本分类中缺乏分层混合结构，搜索空间无限制导致过大且冗余，现有RL模型无法有效导航搜索空间，平面架构搜索导致搜索空间混乱难以遍历。

Method: 引入分层架构模板组织搜索空间，基于领域特定线索设计搜索空间，采用Q-learning动态调整变异策略，基于性能反馈自适应变异，实现完全概率化搜索空间探索。

Result: 在数据库ID预测任务中持续发现高性能架构，在Spider数据集上测试准确率相比现有基线提升8%。

Conclusion: HHNAS-AM方法通过分层组织和自适应变异策略，有效解决了NAS在文本分类中的搜索空间问题，显著提升了架构搜索效率和性能。

Abstract: Neural Architecture Search (NAS) has garnered significant research interest
due to its capability to discover architectures superior to manually designed
ones. Learning text representation is crucial for text classification and other
language-related tasks. The NAS model used in text classification does not have
a Hybrid hierarchical structure, and there is no restriction on the
architecture structure, due to which the search space becomes very large and
mostly redundant, so the existing RL models are not able to navigate the search
space effectively. Also, doing a flat architecture search leads to an
unorganised search space, which is difficult to traverse. For this purpose, we
propose HHNAS-AM (Hierarchical Hybrid Neural Architecture Search with Adaptive
Mutation Policies), a novel approach that efficiently explores diverse
architectural configurations. We introduce a few architectural templates to
search on which organise the search spaces, where search spaces are designed on
the basis of domain-specific cues. Our method employs mutation strategies that
dynamically adapt based on performance feedback from previous iterations using
Q-learning, enabling a more effective and accelerated traversal of the search
space. The proposed model is fully probabilistic, enabling effective
exploration of the search space. We evaluate our approach on the database id
(db_id) prediction task, where it consistently discovers high-performing
architectures across multiple experiments. On the Spider dataset, our method
achieves an 8% improvement in test accuracy over existing baselines.

TL;DR: LPO是一种新的偏好对齐框架，通过梯度解耦、偏移约束和可控拒绝抑制来解决DPO的过拟合和崩溃问题，在各种任务上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DPO虽然简单稳定但容易过拟合和崩溃，需要更好的偏好优化算法来解决这些问题。

Method: 引入梯度解耦（用绝对差损失替代log-sigmoid）、偏移约束加正正则化保持响应质量、可控拒绝抑制（梯度分离和可调系数线性控制拒绝概率下降）。

Result: 在通用文本任务、数学任务和文本转语音任务上均表现出持续的性能提升。

Conclusion: LPO是一个鲁棒且可调的偏好对齐范式，已公开源代码、模型和训练数据。

Abstract: DPO (Direct Preference Optimization) has become a widely used offline
preference optimization algorithm due to its simplicity and training stability.
However, DPO is prone to overfitting and collapse. To address these challenges,
we propose Linear Preference Optimization (LPO), a novel alignment framework
featuring three key innovations. First, we introduce gradient decoupling by
replacing the log-sigmoid function with an absolute difference loss, thereby
isolating the optimization dynamics. Second, we improve stability through an
offset constraint combined with a positive regularization term to preserve the
chosen response quality. Third, we implement controllable rejection suppression
using gradient separation with straightforward estimation and a tunable
coefficient that linearly regulates the descent of the rejection probability.
Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that LPO consistently improves
performance on various tasks, including general text tasks, math tasks, and
text-to-speech (TTS) tasks. These results establish LPO as a robust and tunable
paradigm for preference alignment, and we release the source code, models, and
training data publicly.

Abstract: Online advertising relies on accurate recommendation models, with recent
advances using pre-trained large-scale foundation models (LFMs) to capture
users' general interests across multiple scenarios and tasks. However, existing
methods have critical limitations: they extract and transfer only user
representations (URs), ignoring valuable item representations (IRs) and
user-item cross representations (CRs); and they simply use a UR as a feature in
downstream applications, which fails to bridge upstream-downstream gaps and
overlooks more transfer granularities. In this paper, we propose LFM4Ads, an
All-Representation Multi-Granularity transfer framework for ads recommendation.
It first comprehensively transfers URs, IRs, and CRs, i.e., all available
representations in the pre-trained foundation model. To effectively utilize the
CRs, it identifies the optimal extraction layer and aggregates them into
transferable coarse-grained forms. Furthermore, we enhance the transferability
via multi-granularity mechanisms: non-linear adapters for feature-level
transfer, an Isomorphic Interaction Module for module-level transfer, and
Standalone Retrieval for model-level transfer. LFM4Ads has been successfully
deployed in Tencent's industrial-scale advertising platform, processing tens of
billions of daily samples while maintaining terabyte-scale model parameters
with billions of sparse embedding keys across approximately two thousand
features. Since its production deployment in Q4 2024, LFM4Ads has achieved 10+
successful production launches across various advertising scenarios, including
primary ones like Weixin Moments and Channels. These launches achieve an
overall GMV lift of 2.45% across the entire platform, translating to estimated
annual revenue increases in the hundreds of millions of dollars.

Abstract: Recent advances in quantum computing and machine learning have given rise to
quantum machine learning (QML), with growing interest in learning from
sequential data. Quantum recurrent models like QLSTM are promising for
time-series prediction, NLP, and reinforcement learning. However, designing
effective variational quantum circuits (VQCs) remains challenging and often
task-specific. To address this, we propose DiffQAS-QLSTM, an end-to-end
differentiable framework that optimizes both VQC parameters and architecture
selection during training. Our results show that DiffQAS-QLSTM consistently
outperforms handcrafted baselines, achieving lower loss across diverse test
settings. This approach opens the door to scalable and adaptive quantum
sequence learning.

Method: 提出算法集体行动框架，协调的少数群体战略性重新标注自身数据来增强公平性。开发了三种实用的模型无关方法来近似理想重新标注，并在真实数据集上进行验证

Result: 研究发现少数群体的一个子群可以显著减少不公平性，同时对整体预测误差的影响很小

Conclusion: 用户端通过协调重新标注数据的集体行动是有效的公平性提升方法，能够在不需要企业端修改训练过程的情况下实现公平性改善

Abstract: Machine learning models often preserve biases present in training data,
leading to unfair treatment of certain minority groups. Despite an array of
existing firm-side bias mitigation techniques, they typically incur utility
costs and require organizational buy-in. Recognizing that many models rely on
user-contributed data, end-users can induce fairness through the framework of
Algorithmic Collective Action, where a coordinated minority group strategically
relabels its own data to enhance fairness, without altering the firm's training
process. We propose three practical, model-agnostic methods to approximate
ideal relabeling and validate them on real-world datasets. Our findings show
that a subgroup of the minority can substantially reduce unfairness with a
small impact on the overall prediction error.

TL;DR: CuMoLoS-MAE是一种基于课程引导的蒙特卡洛随机集成掩码自编码器，用于恢复大气遥感数据中的精细特征，学习数据驱动先验，并量化像素级不确定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的大气遥感数据（如多普勒激光雷达、雷达和辐射计）经常受到低信噪比、距离折叠和虚假不连续性的影响。传统方法会模糊精细结构，而深度学习模型缺乏置信度估计。

Method: 采用课程引导的掩码比例策略，训练ViT解码器从逐渐稀疏的上下文中重建。推理时通过蒙特卡洛方法对随机掩码实现进行采样，多次评估MAE并聚合输出，获得后验预测均值和像素级不确定性图。

Conclusion: 该深度学习工作流程支持增强的对流诊断、实时数据同化和改进的长期气候再分析。

Abstract: Accurate atmospheric profiles from remote sensing instruments such as Doppler
Lidar, Radar, and radiometers are frequently corrupted by low-SNR (Signal to
Noise Ratio) gates, range folding, and spurious discontinuities. Traditional
gap filling blurs fine-scale structures, whereas deep models lack confidence
estimates. We present CuMoLoS-MAE, a Curriculum-Guided Monte Carlo Stochastic
Ensemble Masked Autoencoder designed to (i) restore fine-scale features such as
updraft and downdraft cores, shear lines, and small vortices, (ii) learn a
data-driven prior over atmospheric fields, and (iii) quantify pixel-wise
uncertainty. During training, CuMoLoS-MAE employs a mask-ratio curriculum that
forces a ViT decoder to reconstruct from progressively sparser context. At
inference, we approximate the posterior predictive by Monte Carlo over random
mask realisations, evaluating the MAE multiple times and aggregating the
outputs to obtain the posterior predictive mean reconstruction together with a
finely resolved per-pixel uncertainty map. Together with high-fidelity
reconstruction, this novel deep learning-based workflow enables enhanced
convection diagnostics, supports real-time data assimilation, and improves
long-term climate reanalysis.

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了大型机器学习模型分布式分区中的内存约束和性能优化问题，通过智能搜索策略实现了全自动的高效分区解决方案。

Abstract: Partitioning large machine learning models across distributed accelerator
systems is a complex process, requiring a series of interdependent decisions
that are further complicated by internal sharding ambiguities. Consequently,
existing auto-partitioners often suffer from out-of-memory errors or are
prohibitively slow when exploring the exponentially large space of possible
partitionings. To mitigate this, they artificially restrict the search space,
but this approach frequently yields infeasible solutions that violate device
memory constraints or lead to sub-optimal performance.
  We propose a system that combines a novel static compiler analysis with a
Monte Carlo Tree Search. Our analysis constructs an efficient decision space by
identifying (i) tensor dimensions requiring identical sharding, and (ii)
partitioning "conflicts" that require resolution.
  Our system significantly outperforms state-of-the-art industrial methods
across diverse hardware platforms and model architectures, discovering
previously unknown, superior solutions, and the process is fully automated even
for complex and large models.

Motivation: 图神经网络在分子属性预测方面表现出色，但其黑盒性质降低了可解释性，限制了在药物发现等重要应用中的可信度。现有解释技术往往无法可靠量化单个原子或子结构的贡献。

Method: SEAL将输入图分解为化学相关片段，通过减少片段间消息传递来估计它们对模型输出的因果影响，实现片段贡献与预测之间的强对齐。

Result: 在合成基准测试和真实分子数据集上的广泛评估表明，SEAL在定量归因指标和人类对齐可解释性方面均优于其他可解释性方法。用户研究进一步证实SEAL为领域专家提供了更直观可信的解释。

Conclusion: SEAL通过弥合预测性能和可解释性之间的差距，为更透明和可操作的分子建模提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Graph neural networks have demonstrated remarkable success in predicting
molecular properties by leveraging the rich structural information encoded in
molecular graphs. However, their black-box nature reduces interpretability,
which limits trust in their predictions for important applications such as drug
discovery and materials design. Furthermore, existing explanation techniques
often fail to reliably quantify the contribution of individual atoms or
substructures due to the entangled message-passing dynamics. We introduce SEAL
(Substructure Explanation via Attribution Learning), a new interpretable graph
neural network that attributes model predictions to meaningful molecular
subgraphs. SEAL decomposes input graphs into chemically relevant fragments and
estimates their causal influence on the output. The strong alignment between
fragment contributions and model predictions is achieved by explicitly reducing
inter-fragment message passing in our proposed model architecture. Extensive
evaluations on synthetic benchmarks and real-world molecular datasets
demonstrate that SEAL outperforms other explainability methods in both
quantitative attribution metrics and human-aligned interpretability. A user
study further confirms that SEAL provides more intuitive and trustworthy
explanations to domain experts. By bridging the gap between predictive
performance and interpretability, SEAL offers a promising direction for more
transparent and actionable molecular modeling.

Motivation: 传统梯度下降方法只能提供点估计而无法衡量置信度，特别是在过参数化和数据稀缺的情况下容易过拟合。传统bootstrap方法在深度学习中不实用，需要训练多个副本且无法指导学习过程

Method: 提出Twin-Bootstrap Gradient Descent (Twin-Boot)：并行训练两个相同模型在独立的bootstrap样本上，通过周期性均值重置保持两个轨迹在同一basin中，利用其分歧反映局部不确定性，并在训练中使用该估计进行自适应权重采样

Result: 在深度神经网络和复杂高维逆问题中，该方法提高了校准性和泛化能力，并产生了可解释的不确定性图

Conclusion: Twin-Boot成功将不确定性估计集成到优化过程中，解决了传统bootstrap在深度学习中的局限性，为过参数化模型提供了有效的正则化和不确定性量化方法

Abstract: Standard gradient descent methods yield point estimates with no measure of
confidence. This limitation is acute in overparameterized and low-data regimes,
where models have many parameters relative to available data and can easily
overfit. Bootstrapping is a classical statistical framework for uncertainty
estimation based on resampling, but naively applying it to deep learning is
impractical: it requires training many replicas, produces post-hoc estimates
that cannot guide learning, and implicitly assumes comparable optima across
runs - an assumption that fails in non-convex landscapes. We introduce
Twin-Bootstrap Gradient Descent (Twin-Boot), a resampling-based training
procedure that integrates uncertainty estimation into optimization. Two
identical models are trained in parallel on independent bootstrap samples, and
a periodic mean-reset keeps both trajectories in the same basin so that their
divergence reflects local (within-basin) uncertainty. During training, we use
this estimate to sample weights in an adaptive, data-driven way, providing
regularization that favors flatter solutions. In deep neural networks and
complex high-dimensional inverse problems, the approach improves calibration
and generalization and yields interpretable uncertainty maps.

Abstract: We consider federated learning of linearly-parameterized nonlinear systems.
We establish theoretical guarantees on the effectiveness of federated nonlinear
system identification compared to centralized approaches, demonstrating that
the convergence rate improves as the number of clients increases. Although the
convergence rates in the linear and nonlinear cases differ only by a constant,
this constant depends on the feature map $\phi$, which can be carefully chosen
in the nonlinear setting to increase excitation and improve performance. We
experimentally validate our theory in physical settings where client devices
are driven by i.i.d. control inputs and control policies exhibiting i.i.d.
random perturbations, ensuring non-active exploration. Experiments use
trajectories from nonlinear dynamical systems characterized by real-analytic
feature functions, including polynomial and trigonometric components,
representative of physical systems including pendulum and quadrotor dynamics.
We analyze the convergence behavior of the proposed method under varying noise
levels and data distributions. Results show that federated learning
consistently improves convergence of any individual client as the number of
participating clients increases.

Abstract: With the growing size of deep neural networks and datasets, the computational
costs of training have significantly increased. The layer-freezing technique
has recently attracted great attention as a promising method to effectively
reduce the cost of network training. However, in traditional layer-freezing
methods, frozen layers are still required for forward propagation to generate
feature maps for unfrozen layers, limiting the reduction of computation costs.
To overcome this, prior works proposed a hypothetical solution, which caches
feature maps from frozen layers as a new dataset, allowing later layers to
train directly on stored feature maps. While this approach appears to be
straightforward, it presents several major challenges that are severely
overlooked by prior literature, such as how to effectively apply augmentations
to feature maps and the substantial storage overhead introduced. If these
overlooked challenges are not addressed, the performance of the caching method
will be severely impacted and even make it infeasible. This paper is the first
to comprehensively explore these challenges and provides a systematic solution.
To improve training accuracy, we propose \textit{similarity-aware channel
augmentation}, which caches channels with high augmentation sensitivity with a
minimum additional storage cost. To mitigate storage overhead, we incorporate
lossy data compression into layer freezing and design a \textit{progressive
compression} strategy, which increases compression rates as more layers are
frozen, effectively reducing storage costs. Finally, our solution achieves
significant reductions in training cost while maintaining model accuracy, with
a minor time overhead. Additionally, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of
freezing and compression strategies, providing insights into optimizing their
application for efficient DNN training.

Abstract: Conversion rate (CVR) prediction is a core component of online advertising
systems, where the attribution mechanisms-rules for allocating conversion
credit across user touchpoints-fundamentally determine label generation and
model optimization. While many industrial platforms support diverse attribution
mechanisms (e.g., First-Click, Last-Click, Linear, and Data-Driven Multi-Touch
Attribution), conventional approaches restrict model training to labels from a
single production-critical attribution mechanism, discarding complementary
signals in alternative attribution perspectives.
  To address this limitation, we propose a novel Multi-Attribution Learning
(MAL) framework for CVR prediction that integrates signals from multiple
attribution perspectives to better capture the underlying patterns driving user
conversions. Specifically, MAL is a joint learning framework consisting of two
core components: the Attribution Knowledge Aggregator (AKA) and the Primary
Target Predictor (PTP). AKA is implemented as a multi-task learner that
integrates knowledge extracted from diverse attribution labels. PTP, in
contrast, focuses on the task of generating well-calibrated conversion
probabilities that align with the system-optimized attribution metric (e.g.,
CVR under the Last-Click attribution), ensuring direct compatibility with
industrial deployment requirements. Additionally, we propose CAT, a novel
training strategy that leverages the Cartesian product of all attribution label
combinations to generate enriched supervision signals. This design
substantially enhances the performance of the attribution knowledge aggregator.
Empirical evaluations demonstrate the superiority of MAL over
single-attribution learning baselines, achieving +0.51% GAUC improvement on
offline metrics. Online experiments demonstrate that MAL achieved a +2.6%
increase in ROI (Return on Investment).

### [106] [Robust Estimation Under Heterogeneous Corruption Rates](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15051)
*Syomantak Chaudhuri,Jerry Li,Thomas A. Courtade*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文研究了异构腐败率下的鲁棒估计问题，针对不同样本具有已知但非相同的腐败概率的情况，给出了多元有界分布和单变量高斯分布均值估计的紧致极小极大率，以及多元高斯均值估计和线性回归的近似极小极大率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分布式学习、众包和传感器网络等应用中，样本的腐败率通常是异构的而非均匀的，但现有鲁棒估计方法大多忽略这种结构性异质性，因此需要开发能够利用腐败率先验信息的估计器。

Method: 通过理论分析建立异构腐败模式下的极小极大风险下界和上界，证明最优估计器可以丢弃超过特定腐败阈值的样本，该阈值由给定的腐败率经验分布决定。

Result: 获得了多元有界分布和单变量高斯分布均值估计的紧致极小极大率，以及多元高斯均值估计和线性回归的平方误差极小极大率（达到√d因子）。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明，在异构腐败设置下，最优估计策略是丢弃腐败率超过特定阈值的样本，这一发现为实际应用中的鲁棒估计提供了理论指导。

Abstract: We study the problem of robust estimation under heterogeneous corruption
rates, where each sample may be independently corrupted with a known but
non-identical probability. This setting arises naturally in distributed and
federated learning, crowdsourcing, and sensor networks, yet existing robust
estimators typically assume uniform or worst-case corruption, ignoring
structural heterogeneity. For mean estimation for multivariate bounded
distributions and univariate gaussian distributions, we give tight minimax
rates for all heterogeneous corruption patterns. For multivariate gaussian mean
estimation and linear regression, we establish the minimax rate for squared
error up to a factor of $\sqrt{d}$, where $d$ is the dimension. Roughly, our
findings suggest that samples beyond a certain corruption threshold may be
discarded by the optimal estimators -- this threshold is determined by the
empirical distribution of the corruption rates given.

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Modern optimization algorithms that incorporate momentum and adaptive
step-size offer improved performance in numerous challenging deep learning
tasks. However, their effectiveness is often highly sensitive to the choice of
hyperparameters, especially the step-size. Tuning these parameters is often
difficult, resource-intensive, and time-consuming. Therefore, recent efforts
have been directed toward enhancing the stability of optimizers across a wide
range of hyperparameter choices [Schaipp et al., 2024]. In this paper, we
introduce an algorithm that matches the performance of state-of-the-art
optimizers while improving stability to the choice of the step-size
hyperparameter through a novel adaptation of the NGN step-size method [Orvieto
and Xiao, 2024]. Specifically, we propose a momentum-based version (NGN-M) that
attains the standard convergence rate of $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{K})$ under less
restrictive assumptions, without the need for interpolation condition or
assumptions of bounded stochastic gradients or iterates, in contrast to
previous approaches. Additionally, we empirically demonstrate that the
combination of the NGN step-size with momentum results in enhanced robustness
to the choice of the step-size hyperparameter while delivering performance that
is comparable to or surpasses other state-of-the-art optimizers.

TL;DR: 该研究分析了深度神经网络在过参数化状态下的泛化行为，揭示了输出特征空间崩溃现象及其与网络层数的关系，提出了绕过退化状态的"虫洞"解决方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究深度神经网络中"欺骗性示例"的现象，即神经网络对看似随机的输入产生高置信度分类，旨在理解DNN的泛化行为并提供理论分析框架。

Method: 采用基于最大似然估计的分析框架，避免传统的基于梯度的优化和显式标签方法，研究过参数化状态下DNN的输出特征空间崩溃现象。

Result: 发现DNN在过参数化状态下会出现输出特征空间崩溃，虽然提高泛化能力但增加层数会导致退化状态；提出的"虫洞"解决方案能够绕过退化状态，将随机输入与有意义的标签关联。

Conclusion: 研究为理解DNN泛化提供了新视角，揭示了特征空间崩溃与网络深度的关系，"虫洞"解决方案为理解捷径学习提供了新思路，指出了无监督学习动态研究的未来方向。

Abstract: This work investigates the generalization behavior of deep neural networks
(DNNs), focusing on the phenomenon of "fooling examples," where DNNs
confidently classify inputs that appear random or unstructured to humans. To
explore this phenomenon, we introduce an analytical framework based on maximum
likelihood estimation, without adhering to conventional numerical approaches
that rely on gradient-based optimization and explicit labels. Our analysis
reveals that DNNs operating in an overparameterized regime exhibit a collapse
in the output feature space. While this collapse improves network
generalization, adding more layers eventually leads to a state of degeneracy,
where the model learns trivial solutions by mapping distinct inputs to the same
output, resulting in zero loss. Further investigation demonstrates that this
degeneracy can be bypassed using our newly derived "wormhole" solution. The
wormhole solution, when applied to arbitrary fooling examples, reconciles
meaningful labels with random ones and provides a novel perspective on shortcut
learning. These findings offer deeper insights into DNN generalization and
highlight directions for future research on learning dynamics in unsupervised
settings to bridge the gap between theory and practice.

*Moghis Fereidouni,Muhammad Umair Haider,Peizhong Ju,A. B. Siddique*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文首次系统评估稀疏自编码器(SAE)在单义性方面的表现，提出基于Jensen-Shannon距离的概念分离度评分，发现SAE能减少多义性但稀疏性不一定带来更好分离度，并提出了新的干预方法APP。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型存在多义性问题（神经元对多个不相关概念激活），稀疏自编码器被提出用于改善可解释性，但缺乏与基础模型的定量比较。

Method: 使用Gemma-2-2B模型和多种SAE变体，在五个基准测试上引入基于Jensen-Shannon距离的概念分离度评分，评估两种干预策略：完全神经元掩码和部分抑制。

Result: SAE减少了多义性并实现了更高的概念分离度，但更大的稀疏性并不总是带来更好的分离度，且经常损害下游性能。SAE在使用部分抑制时能实现更精确的概念级控制。

Conclusion: 提出的新干预方法APP（基于后验概率的衰减）在目标概念移除方面优于现有方法，SAE为概念级控制提供了更精确的工具。

Abstract: A key barrier to interpreting large language models is polysemanticity, where
neurons activate for multiple unrelated concepts. Sparse autoencoders (SAEs)
have been proposed to mitigate this issue by transforming dense activations
into sparse, more interpretable features. While prior work suggests that SAEs
promote monosemanticity, there has been no quantitative comparison with their
base models. This paper provides the first systematic evaluation of SAEs
against base models concerning monosemanticity. We introduce a fine-grained
concept separability score based on the Jensen-Shannon distance, which captures
how distinctly a neuron's activation distributions vary across concepts. Using
Gemma-2-2B and multiple SAE variants across five benchmarks, we show that SAEs
reduce polysemanticity and achieve higher concept separability. However,
greater sparsity of SAEs does not always yield better separability and often
impairs downstream performance. To assess practical utility, we evaluate
concept-level interventions using two strategies: full neuron masking and
partial suppression. We find that, compared to base models, SAEs enable more
precise concept-level control when using partial suppression. Building on this,
we propose Attenuation via Posterior Probabilities (APP), a new intervention
method that uses concept-conditioned activation distributions for targeted
suppression. APP outperforms existing approaches in targeted concept removal.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Hydra是一个1.6B参数的混合长上下文语言模型架构，结合了条件计算、长上下文记忆机制和稀疏专家混合，旨在实现模块化、输入自适应的长上下文处理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决传统语言模型在处理长上下文时面临的计算复杂度和内存使用问题，同时保持模型效率和处理能力。

Method: 整合Mamba式结构化状态空间模型(SSM)骨干网络、间歇性稀疏全局注意力、分块级MoE前馈路由以及双记忆系统(工作记忆+事实PKM记忆)，并采用分阶段课程学习策略。

Result: 通过小规模原型验证了实现可行性，展示了长上下文吞吐量交叉和可控专家路由等定性扩展行为，但尚未进行大规模性能验证。

Conclusion: Hydra提供了一个蓝图架构，结合了SSM效率、选择性稀疏注意力、MoE容量和可学习记忆，为模块化长上下文语言模型指明了发展方向，但最终性能验证仍需未来工作。

Abstract: We present Hydra as an architectural proposal for hybrid long-context
language models that combine conditional computation, long-context memory
mechanisms, and sparse mixture-of-experts within an approximately 1.6B
parameter design envelope. Hydra integrates a Mamba-style Structured State
Space Model (SSM) backbone with intermittent sparse global attention,
chunk-level MoE feed-forward routing, and dual (workspace plus factual PKM)
memories. We formalize the component interfaces, give transparent parameter and
complexity accounting, and outline a staged curriculum intended to stably
activate the parts. We accompany the specification with illustrative toy-scale
prototype measurements (tens of millions of parameters on synthetic data) whose
sole purpose is to demonstrate implementation feasibility and qualitative
scaling behaviors (for example, long-context throughput crossover and
controllable expert routing), not to claim competitive full-scale performance.
We explicitly delineate assumptions and open risks (training complexity, memory
utilization, specialization dynamics) and position Hydra as a blueprint to
stimulate empirical follow-up rather than a finished system. By combining SSM
efficiency, selective sparse attention, MoE capacity, and learnable memory,
Hydra sketches a path toward modular, input-adaptive long-context language
models; validating end-task gains at target scale remains future work.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着文本到图像生成模型在隐私、版权和安全方面的担忧日益增加，概念擦除技术被开发出来阻止生成特定不良概念。然而这些技术的实际效果和鲁棒性需要系统评估。

Method: 提出了Side Effect Evaluation (SEE)评估基准，包含分层和组合式提示词，通过自动化评估管道从三个维度量化CETs的副作用：对邻近概念的影响、目标规避和属性泄漏。

Result: 实验表明CETs可以通过超类-子类层级结构和语义相似提示词轻易绕过，存在属性泄漏问题，并出现注意力集中或分散的反直觉现象。

Conclusion: 当前的概念擦除技术存在严重缺陷，需要更鲁棒的解决方案。作者发布了数据集、代码和评估工具以支持未来研究。

Abstract: Concerns about text-to-image (T2I) generative models infringing on privacy,
copyright, and safety have led to the development of Concept Erasure Techniques
(CETs).
  The goal of an effective CET is to prohibit the generation of undesired
``target'' concepts specified by the user, while preserving the ability to
synthesize high-quality images of the remaining concepts.
  In this work, we demonstrate that CETs can be easily circumvented and present
several side effects of concept erasure.
  For a comprehensive measurement of the robustness of CETs, we present Side
Effect Evaluation (\see), an evaluation benchmark that consists of hierarchical
and compositional prompts that describe objects and their attributes.
  This dataset and our automated evaluation pipeline quantify side effects of
CETs across three aspects: impact on neighboring concepts, evasion of targets,
and attribute leakage.
  Our experiments reveal that CETs can be circumvented by using
superclass-subclass hierarchy and semantically similar prompts, such as
compositional variants of the target. We show that CETs suffer from attribute
leakage and counterintuitive phenomena of attention concentration or dispersal.
  We release our dataset, code, and evaluation tools to aid future work on
robust concept erasure.

Motivation: 随着机器学习普及和数据隐私法规发展，从训练模型中移除私有或受版权保护信息的需求日益重要。现有遗忘方法通常需要访问完整训练数据集，但在实际场景中原始数据可能无法获取。

Method: 基于最近研究，提出了一种估计未知剩余训练数据Hessian矩阵的方法，这是高效遗忘的关键组件。利用这种估计技术，实现了高效的零样本遗忘。

Result: 广泛的实验验证了该方法在各种数据集上的有效性，能够在保持剩余数据性能的同时提供稳健的理论保证。

Conclusion: 该方法解决了无源设置下的模型遗忘问题，为实际应用中的隐私保护和版权合规提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: As machine learning becomes more pervasive and data privacy regulations
evolve, the ability to remove private or copyrighted information from trained
models is becoming an increasingly critical requirement. Existing unlearning
methods often rely on the assumption of having access to the entire training
dataset during the forgetting process. However, this assumption may not hold
true in practical scenarios where the original training data may not be
accessible, i.e., the source-free setting. To address this challenge, we focus
on the source-free unlearning scenario, where an unlearning algorithm must be
capable of removing specific data from a trained model without requiring access
to the original training dataset. Building on recent work, we present a method
that can estimate the Hessian of the unknown remaining training data, a crucial
component required for efficient unlearning. Leveraging this estimation
technique, our method enables efficient zero-shot unlearning while providing
robust theoretical guarantees on the unlearning performance, while maintaining
performance on the remaining data. Extensive experiments over a wide range of
datasets verify the efficacy of our method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统强化学习框架在数学基础上存在局限性，需要更强大的数学工具来统一处理各种动态系统模型，并支持异步分布式计算。

Method: 使用范畴论和函子理论建模RL算法空间，将MDP、POMDP、PSR等动态系统视为特殊类型的余代数，通过确定最终余代数来推广RL中的固定点求解问题。

Result: 建立了URL的理论框架，展示了如何用范畴论工具统一处理各种RL模型，并将Bertsekas和Tsitsiklis的异步分布式最小化模型与度量共归纳联系起来。

Conclusion: URL提供了一个强大的数学框架，能够统一处理传统RL模型，支持异步并行分布式计算，并为RL理论发展提供了新的方向。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a categorial generalization of RL, termed
universal reinforcement learning (URL), building on powerful mathematical
abstractions from the study of coinduction on non-well-founded sets and
universal coalgebras, topos theory, and categorial models of asynchronous
parallel distributed computation. In the first half of the paper, we review the
basic RL framework, illustrate the use of categories and functors in RL,
showing how they lead to interesting insights. In particular, we also introduce
a standard model of asynchronous distributed minimization proposed by Bertsekas
and Tsitsiklis, and describe the relationship between metric coinduction and
their proof of the Asynchronous Convergence Theorem. The space of algorithms
for MDPs or PSRs can be modeled as a functor category, where the co-domain
category forms a topos, which admits all (co)limits, possesses a subobject
classifier, and has exponential objects. In the second half of the paper, we
move on to universal coalgebras. Dynamical system models, such as Markov
decision processes (MDPs), partially observed MDPs (POMDPs), a predictive state
representation (PSRs), and linear dynamical systems (LDSs) are all special
types of coalgebras. We describe a broad family of universal coalgebras,
extending the dynamic system models studied previously in RL. The core problem
in finding fixed points in RL to determine the exact or approximate (action)
value function is generalized in URL to determining the final coalgebra
asynchronously in a parallel distributed manner.

Abstract: There is a flurry of recent research papers proposing novel differentially
private machine learning (DPML) techniques. These papers claim to achieve new
state-of-the-art (SoTA) results and offer empirical results as validation.
However, there is no consensus on which techniques are most effective or if
they genuinely meet their stated claims. Complicating matters, heterogeneity in
codebases, datasets, methodologies, and model architectures make direct
comparisons of different approaches challenging.
  In this paper, we conduct a reproducibility and replicability (R+R)
experiment on 11 different SoTA DPML techniques from the recent research
literature. Results of our investigation are varied: while some methods stand
up to scrutiny, others falter when tested outside their initial experimental
conditions. We also discuss challenges unique to the reproducibility of DPML,
including additional randomness due to DP noise, and how to address them.
Finally, we derive insights and best practices to obtain scientifically valid
and reliable results.

Motivation: 越狱攻击通过制作对抗性提示绕过LLM的对齐机制，导致模型产生有害内容，严重威胁LLM的安全性。

Method: 采用三阶段管道：1) 动态不安全输出检测（外部分类器+模型内部评估）；2) 通过FFN激活进行词级有害内容追踪；3) 约束优化抑制不安全行为而不降低模型质量

Result: 在多个越狱基准测试中显著降低攻击成功率，同时保持高性能，相比标准防御方法提供更强的安全保证和鲁棒性

Conclusion: 遗忘学习是LLM安全领域一个可扩展且有效的有前景方向

Abstract: Jailbreak attacks pose a serious threat to the safety of Large Language
Models (LLMs) by crafting adversarial prompts that bypass alignment mechanisms,
causing the models to produce harmful, restricted, or biased content. In this
paper, we propose SafeLLM, a novel unlearning-based defense framework that
unlearn the harmful knowledge from LLMs while preserving linguistic fluency and
general capabilities. SafeLLM employs a three-stage pipeline: (1) dynamic
unsafe output detection using a hybrid approach that integrates external
classifiers with model-internal evaluations; (2) token-level harmful content
tracing through feedforward network (FFN) activations to localize harmful
knowledge; and (3) constrained optimization to suppress unsafe behavior without
degrading overall model quality. SafeLLM achieves targeted and irreversible
forgetting by identifying and neutralizing FFN substructures responsible for
harmful generation pathways. Extensive experiments on prominent LLMs (Vicuna,
LLaMA, and GPT-J) across multiple jailbreak benchmarks show that SafeLLM
substantially reduces attack success rates while maintaining high
general-purpose performance. Compared to standard defense methods such as
supervised fine-tuning and direct preference optimization, SafeLLM offers
stronger safety guarantees, more precise control over harmful behavior, and
greater robustness to unseen attacks. Moreover, SafeLLM maintains the general
performance after the harmful knowledge unlearned. These results highlight
unlearning as a promising direction for scalable and effective LLM safety.

Motivation: 随着机器学习系统在高风险决策中的应用日益增多，确保算法结果的公平性变得至关重要。预处理方法具有模型无关性和更好的隐私合规性优势，但缺乏标准化评估工具

Method: 基于AIF360平台构建的FairPrep框架，提供数据集、公平性干预措施和预测模型的无缝集成，具有批处理接口和自动报告功能

Result: 该框架支持标准化流水线和可重复评估，为数据级公平性研究提供了实用基础

Conclusion: FairPrep填补了公平性基准测试领域的关键空白，为推进数据级公平性研究提供了重要工具

Abstract: As machine learning systems become increasingly integrated into high-stakes
decision-making processes, ensuring fairness in algorithmic outcomes has become
a critical concern. Methods to mitigate bias typically fall into three
categories: pre-processing, in-processing, and post-processing. While
significant attention has been devoted to the latter two, pre-processing
methods, which operate at the data level and offer advantages such as
model-agnosticism and improved privacy compliance, have received comparatively
less focus and lack standardised evaluation tools. In this work, we introduce
FairPrep, an extensible and modular benchmarking framework designed to evaluate
fairness-aware pre-processing techniques on tabular datasets. Built on the
AIF360 platform, FairPrep allows seamless integration of datasets, fairness
interventions, and predictive models. It features a batch-processing interface
that enables efficient experimentation and automatic reporting of fairness and
utility metrics. By offering standardised pipelines and supporting reproducible
evaluations, FairPrep fills a critical gap in the fairness benchmarking
landscape and provides a practical foundation for advancing data-level fairness
research.

Abstract: Tensor neural networks (TNNs) have demonstrated their superiority in solving
high-dimensional problems. However, similar to conventional neural networks,
TNNs are also influenced by the Frequency Principle, which limits their ability
to accurately capture high-frequency features of the solution. In this work, we
analyze the training dynamics of TNNs by Fourier analysis and enhance their
expressivity for high-dimensional multi-scale problems by incorporating random
Fourier features. Leveraging the inherent tensor structure of TNNs, we further
propose a novel approach to extract frequency features of high-dimensional
functions by performing the Discrete Fourier Transform to one-dimensional
component functions. This strategy effectively mitigates the curse of
dimensionality. Building on this idea, we propose a frequency-adaptive TNNs
algorithm, which significantly improves the ability of TNNs in solving complex
multi-scale problems. Extensive numerical experiments are performed to validate
the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed frequency-adaptive TNNs
algorithm.

Abstract: Classification of sleep stages is essential for assessing sleep quality and
diagnosing sleep disorders such as insomnia. However, manual inspection of EEG
characteristics for each stage is time-consuming and prone to human error.
Although machine learning and deep learning methods have been actively
developed, they continue to face challenges from the non-stationarity and
variability of electroencephalography (EEG) and electrooculography (EOG)
signals, often leading to poor generalization on unseen datasets. This research
proposed a Sleep Stage Classification method by developing Multivariate
Differential Transformer (SleepDIFFormer) for joint EEG and EOG representation
learning. Specifically, SleepDIFFormer was developed to process EEG and EOG
signals using our Multivariate Differential Transformer Architecture (MDTA) for
time series, trained with cross-domain alignment. Our method mitigated spatial
and temporal attention noise while learning a domain-invariant joint EEG-EOG
representation through feature distribution alignment, thereby enabling
generalization to unseen target datasets. Empirically, we evaluated our method
on five different sleep staging datasets and compared it with existing

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种基于局部最优性保证的框架，用于更高效地合成黑盒机器学习模型的解释，在准确性和可解释性之间寻找平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多目标解释合成方法要么缺乏对帕索托最优性的保证，要么在探索帕索托最优空间时面临严重的可扩展性问题。

Method: 首先使用多目标学习或搜索技术生成帕索托最优候选解释，然后通过SAT求解器验证每个候选解在局部邻域内的最优性。

Result: 在一组基准测试中，该方法生成的解释与提供全局保证的方法类似，但更具可扩展性。

Conclusion: 通过局部最优性保证，该框架能够在保持解释质量的同时提高合成效率。

Abstract: Creating meaningful interpretations for black-box machine learning models
involves balancing two often conflicting objectives: accuracy and
explainability. Exploring the trade-off between these objectives is essential
for developing trustworthy interpretations. While many techniques for
multi-objective interpretation synthesis have been developed, they typically
lack formal guarantees on the Pareto-optimality of the results. Methods that do
provide such guarantees, on the other hand, often face severe scalability
limitations when exploring the Pareto-optimal space. To address this, we
develop a framework based on local optimality guarantees that enables more
scalable synthesis of interpretations. Specifically, we consider the problem of
synthesizing a set of Pareto-optimal interpretations with local optimality
guarantees, within the immediate neighborhood of each solution. Our approach
begins with a multi-objective learning or search technique, such as
Multi-Objective Monte Carlo Tree Search, to generate a best-effort set of
Pareto-optimal candidates with respect to accuracy and explainability. We then
verify local optimality for each candidate as a Boolean satisfiability problem,
which we solve using a SAT solver. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach
on a set of benchmarks, comparing it against previous methods for exploring the
Pareto-optimal front of interpretations. In particular, we show that our
approach yields interpretations that closely match those synthesized by methods
offering global guarantees.

TL;DR: 提出多窗口对比学习框架，通过从每个ECG实例提取多个时间窗口构建正样本对，学习时间不变性和生理学意义的特征，在PTB-XL数据集上取得更好性能且训练效率更高


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自监督对比学习方法通常只生成成对的增强视图，未能充分利用ECG记录的丰富时间结构，限制了模型性能

Method: 多窗口对比学习框架，从每个ECG实例提取多个时间窗口构建正样本对，通过统计最大化它们的一致性，并借鉴慢特征分析原理学习时间不变特征

Result: 在PTB-XL数据集上，多标签超类分类的AUROC达到0.891（vs 0.888），F1分数0.680（vs 0.679），预训练epoch减少4倍（32 vs 128），总预训练时间减少14.8%

Conclusion: 多窗口对比学习为ECG分析提供了一种高效可扩展的自监督学习范式，也为生物医学时间序列数据的表示学习提供了有前景的通用框架

Abstract: Electrocardiogram (ECG) analysis is foundational for cardiovascular disease
diagnosis, yet the performance of deep learning models is often constrained by
limited access to annotated data. Self-supervised contrastive learning has
emerged as a powerful approach for learning robust ECG representations from
unlabeled signals. However, most existing methods generate only pairwise
augmented views and fail to leverage the rich temporal structure of ECG
recordings. In this work, we present a poly-window contrastive learning
framework. We extract multiple temporal windows from each ECG instance to
construct positive pairs and maximize their agreement via statistics. Inspired
by the principle of slow feature analysis, our approach explicitly encourages
the model to learn temporally invariant and physiologically meaningful features
that persist across time. We validate our approach through extensive
experiments and ablation studies on the PTB-XL dataset. Our results demonstrate
that poly-window contrastive learning consistently outperforms conventional
two-view methods in multi-label superclass classification, achieving higher
AUROC (0.891 vs. 0.888) and F1 scores (0.680 vs. 0.679) while requiring up to
four times fewer pre-training epochs (32 vs. 128) and 14.8% in total wall clock
pre-training time reduction. Despite processing multiple windows per sample, we
achieve a significant reduction in the number of training epochs and total
computation time, making our method practical for training foundational models.
Through extensive ablations, we identify optimal design choices and demonstrate
robustness across various hyperparameters. These findings establish poly-window
contrastive learning as a highly efficient and scalable paradigm for automated
ECG analysis and provide a promising general framework for self-supervised
representation learning in biomedical time-series data.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown great potential in reasoning tasks
through test-time scaling methods like self-consistency with majority voting.
However, this approach often leads to diminishing returns in accuracy and high
computational overhead. To address these challenges, we introduce Deep Think

reasoning efficiency and performance at test time. DeepConf leverages
model-internal confidence signals to dynamically filter out low-quality
reasoning traces during or after generation. It requires no additional model
training or hyperparameter tuning and can be seamlessly integrated into
existing serving frameworks. We evaluate DeepConf across a variety of reasoning
tasks and the latest open-source models, including Qwen 3 and GPT-OSS series.
Notably, on challenging benchmarks such as AIME 2025, DeepConf@512 achieves up
to 99.9% accuracy and reduces generated tokens by up to 84.7% compared to full

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文批判性评估了CSG指标在知识图谱链接预测中的有效性，发现其对参数敏感且与性能指标相关性弱，提出了更可靠的结构和语义复杂度指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解数据集复杂度对于评估知识图谱链接预测模型至关重要，但之前提出的CSG指标尚未在KG环境中得到验证，需要系统评估其在多关系链接预测中的有效性。

Method: 在知识图谱链接预测环境中评估CSG指标，结合transformer生成的语义表示，并引入和基准测试一组结构和语义KG复杂度指标，包括关系熵、最大关系多样性等。

Result: CSG对参数高度敏感，不能稳健地随类别数量扩展，与MRR和Hit@1等性能指标相关性弱或不一致。而关系熵、最大关系多样性等指标与性能指标呈现强负相关。

Conclusion: CSG在链接预测环境中缺乏稳定性和泛化预测能力，需要开发更稳定、可解释且与任务对齐的数据集复杂度度量方法。

Abstract: Understanding dataset complexity is fundamental to evaluating and comparing
link prediction models on knowledge graphs (KGs). While the Cumulative Spectral
Gradient (CSG) metric, derived from probabilistic divergence between classes
within a spectral clustering framework, has been proposed as a classifier
agnostic complexity metric purportedly scaling with class cardinality and
correlating with downstream performance, it has not been evaluated in KG
settings so far. In this work, we critically examine CSG in the context of
multi relational link prediction, incorporating semantic representations via
transformer derived embeddings. Contrary to prior claims, we find that CSG is
highly sensitive to parametrisation and does not robustly scale with the number
of classes. Moreover, it exhibits weak or inconsistent correlation with
standard performance metrics such as Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) and Hit@1. To
deepen the analysis, we introduce and benchmark a set of structural and
semantic KG complexity metrics. Our findings reveal that global and local
relational ambiguity captured via Relation Entropy, node level Maximum Relation
Diversity, and Relation Type Cardinality exhibit strong inverse correlations
with MRR and Hit@1, suggesting these as more faithful indicators of task
difficulty. Conversely, graph connectivity measures such as Average Degree,
Degree Entropy, PageRank, and Eigenvector Centrality correlate positively with
Hit@10. Our results demonstrate that CSGs purported stability and
generalization predictive power fail to hold in link prediction settings and
underscore the need for more stable, interpretable, and task-aligned measures
of dataset complexity in knowledge driven learning.

TL;DR: PL-Reg是一种基于部分逻辑正则化的新方法，通过在模型中为未定义逻辑公式预留空间，有效提升对未知类别的泛化能力，解决了现有方法在未知类别处理上的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉分类方法在泛化能力方面存在显著挑战，特别是处理现实应用中的未知类别。传统类发现范式偏向已知类别，增量学习范式存在灾难性遗忘问题，而L-Reg等逻辑正则化方法受限于完全定义逻辑公式的要求，缺乏对未知类别的灵活性。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，PL-Reg consistently显示出性能提升，特别是在处理未知类别方面表现优异，证明了部分逻辑方法在提升模型泛化能力方面的有效性。

Conclusion: 部分逻辑正则化为解决未知类别相关挑战提供了有效途径，PL-Reg方法在保持模型灵活性的同时显著提升了泛化性能，为视觉分类任务的现实应用提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Generalization remains a significant challenge in visual classification
tasks, particularly in handling unknown classes in real-world applications.
Existing research focuses on the class discovery paradigm, which tends to favor
known classes, and the incremental learning paradigm, which suffers from
catastrophic forgetting. Recent approaches such as the L-Reg technique employ
logic-based regularization to enhance generalization but are bound by the
necessity of fully defined logical formulas, limiting flexibility for unknown
classes. This paper introduces PL-Reg, a novel partial-logic regularization
term that allows models to reserve space for undefined logic formulas,
improving adaptability to unknown classes. Specifically, we formally
demonstrate that tasks involving unknown classes can be effectively explained
using partial logic. We also prove that methods based on partial logic lead to
improved generalization. We validate PL-Reg through extensive experiments on
Generalized Category Discovery, Multi-Domain Generalized Category Discovery,
and long-tailed Class Incremental Learning tasks, demonstrating consistent
performance improvements. Our results highlight the effectiveness of partial
logic in tackling challenges related to unknown classes.

Conclusion: ExBigBang通过整合多模态数据和可解释技术，有效解决了人物角色分类中的上下文建模和可解释性问题，为以用户为中心的设计提供了更可靠的指导。

Abstract: In user-centric design, persona development plays a vital role in
understanding user behaviour, capturing needs, segmenting audiences, and
guiding design decisions. However, the growing complexity of user interactions
calls for a more contextualized approach to ensure designs align with real user
needs. While earlier studies have advanced persona classification by modelling
user behaviour, capturing contextual information, especially by integrating
textual and tabular data, remains a key challenge. These models also often lack
explainability, leaving their predictions difficult to interpret or justify. To
address these limitations, we present ExBigBang (Explainable BigBang), a hybrid
text-tabular approach that uses transformer-based architectures to model rich
contextual features for persona classification. ExBigBang incorporates
metadata, domain knowledge, and user profiling to embed deeper context into
predictions. Through a cyclical process of user profiling and classification,
our approach dynamically updates to reflect evolving user behaviours.
Experiments on a benchmark persona classification dataset demonstrate the
robustness of our model. An ablation study confirms the benefits of combining
text and tabular data, while Explainable AI techniques shed light on the
rationale behind the model's predictions.

TL;DR: EvoFormer是一个用于动态图级表示学习的Transformer框架，通过结构感知和时间敏感模块解决结构访问偏差和突变演化盲点问题，在多个基准数据集上达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有动态图嵌入方法存在两个关键问题：结构访问偏差（随机游走采样过度强调高节点导致冗余噪声）和突变演化盲点（刚性时间建模策略无法有效检测突然结构变化），需要新的框架来解决这些问题。

Method: 提出EvoFormer框架，包含：1）结构感知Transformer模块，基于节点结构角色引入位置编码；2）演化敏感时间模块，采用三步策略：随机游走时间戳分类、图级时间分割、段感知时间自注意力结合边演化预测任务。

Conclusion: EvoFormer通过纠正结构和时间偏差，有效解决了动态图表示学习中的关键挑战，验证了其在捕捉结构演化趋势方面的有效性。

Abstract: Dynamic graph-level embedding aims to capture structural evolution in
networks, which is essential for modeling real-world scenarios. However,
existing methods face two critical yet under-explored issues: Structural Visit
Bias, where random walk sampling disproportionately emphasizes high-degree
nodes, leading to redundant and noisy structural representations; and Abrupt
Evolution Blindness, the failure to effectively detect sudden structural
changes due to rigid or overly simplistic temporal modeling strategies,
resulting in inconsistent temporal embeddings. To overcome these challenges, we
propose EvoFormer, an evolution-aware Transformer framework tailored for
dynamic graph-level representation learning. To mitigate Structural Visit Bias,
EvoFormer introduces a Structure-Aware Transformer Module that incorporates
positional encoding based on node structural roles, allowing the model to
globally differentiate and accurately represent node structures. To overcome
Abrupt Evolution Blindness, EvoFormer employs an Evolution-Sensitive Temporal
Module, which explicitly models temporal evolution through a sequential
three-step strategy: (I) Random Walk Timestamp Classification, generating
initial timestamp-aware graph-level embeddings; (II) Graph-Level Temporal
Segmentation, partitioning the graph stream into segments reflecting
structurally coherent periods; and (III) Segment-Aware Temporal Self-Attention
combined with an Edge Evolution Prediction task, enabling the model to
precisely capture segment boundaries and perceive structural evolution trends,
effectively adapting to rapid temporal shifts. Extensive evaluations on five
benchmark datasets confirm that EvoFormer achieves state-of-the-art performance
in graph similarity ranking, temporal anomaly detection, and temporal
segmentation tasks, validating its effectiveness in correcting structural and
temporal biases.

Conclusion: CITE数据集填补了异构文本图标准数据集的空白，为冶金材料领域的表录学习研究提供了重要支撑，有助于推动相关方法的发展和比较

Abstract: Text-attributed graphs(TAGs) are pervasive in real-world systems,where each
node carries its own textual features. In many cases these graphs are
inherently heterogeneous, containing multiple node types and diverse edge
types. Despite the ubiquity of such heterogeneous TAGs, there remains a lack of
large-scale benchmark datasets. This shortage has become a critical bottleneck,
hindering the development and fair comparison of representation learning
methods on heterogeneous text-attributed graphs. In this paper, we introduce
CITE - Catalytic Information Textual Entities Graph, the first and largest
heterogeneous text-attributed citation graph benchmark for catalytic materials.
CITE comprises over 438K nodes and 1.2M edges, spanning four relation types. In
addition, we establish standardized evaluation procedures and conduct extensive
benchmarking on the node classification task, as well as ablation experiments
on the heterogeneous and textual properties of CITE. We compare four classes of
learning paradigms, including homogeneous graph models, heterogeneous graph
models, LLM(Large Language Model)-centric models, and LLM+Graph models. In a
nutshell, we provide (i) an overview of the CITE dataset, (ii) standardized
evaluation protocols, and (iii) baseline and ablation experiments across
diverse modeling paradigms.

Abstract: In this study, we present an Evolving Fuzzy System within the context of
Federated Learning, which adapts dynamically with the addition of new clusters
and therefore does not require the number of clusters to be selected apriori.
Unlike traditional methods, Federated Learning allows models to be trained
locally on clients' devices, sharing only the model parameters with a central
server instead of the data. Our method, implemented using PyTorch, was tested
on clustering and classification tasks. The results show that our approach
outperforms established classification methods on several well-known UCI

Conclusion: 证实了在嵌入式平台上实现快速、轻量级且有效的个性化是可行的，为可扩展和用户感知的HAR系统铺平了道路

Abstract: Human Activity Recognition (HAR) using wearable devices has advanced
significantly in recent years, yet its generalization remains limited when
models are deployed to new users. This degradation in performance is primarily
due to user-induced concept drift (UICD), highlighting the importance of
efficient personalization. In this paper, we present a hybrid framework that
first generalizes across users and then rapidly adapts to individual users
using few-shot learning directly on-device. By updating only the classifier
layer with user-specific data, our method achieves robust personalization with
minimal computational and memory overhead. We implement this framework on the
energy-efficient RISC-V-based GAP9 microcontroller and validate it across three
diverse HAR scenarios: RecGym, QVAR-Gesture, and Ultrasound-Gesture.
Post-deployment adaptation yields consistent accuracy improvements of 3.73\%,
17.38\%, and 3.70\% respectively. These results confirm that fast, lightweight,
and effective personalization is feasible on embedded platforms, paving the way
for scalable and user-aware HAR systems in the wild

Result: 新方法计算速度比现有方法快数倍，能够有效检测重叠聚类同时避免合并正交聚类

Conclusion: 该方法为流式数据在线聚类提供了高效的重叠检测解决方案，具有较高的计算效率和实际应用价值

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new measure for detecting overlap in multivariate
Gaussian clusters. The aim of online learning from data streams is to create
clustering, classification, or regression models that can adapt over time based
on the conceptual drift of streaming data. In the case of clustering, this can
result in a large number of clusters that may overlap and should be merged.
Commonly used distribution dissimilarity measures are not adequate for
determining overlapping clusters in the context of online learning from
streaming data due to their inability to account for all shapes of clusters and
their high computational demands. Our proposed dissimilarity measure is
specifically designed to detect overlap rather than dissimilarity and can be
computed faster compared to existing measures. Our method is several times
faster than compared methods and is capable of detecting overlapping clusters
while avoiding the merging of orthogonal clusters.

Conclusion: MRP方法通过不可逆投影变换从根本上解决了机器遗忘中信息痕迹残留的问题，为模型安全提供了更有效的解决方案。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance
in various domains and tasks, concerns about their safety are becoming
increasingly severe. In particular, since models may store unsafe knowledge
internally, machine unlearning has emerged as a representative paradigm to
ensure model safety. Existing approaches employ various training techniques,
such as gradient ascent and negative preference optimization, in attempts to
eliminate the influence of undesired data on target models. However, these
methods merely suppress the activation of undesired data through parametric
training without completely eradicating its informational traces within the
model. This fundamental limitation makes it difficult to achieve effective
continuous unlearning, rendering these methods vulnerable to relearning
attacks. To overcome these challenges, we propose a Metamorphosis
Representation Projection (MRP) approach that pioneers the application of
irreversible projection properties to machine unlearning. By implementing
projective transformations in the hidden state space of specific network
layers, our method effectively eliminates harmful information while preserving
useful knowledge. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach enables
effective continuous unlearning and successfully defends against relearning
attacks, achieving state-of-the-art performance in unlearning effectiveness
while preserving natural performance. Our code is available in

Abstract: This paper studies an input-driven one-state differential equation model
initially developed for an experimentally demonstrated dynamic molecular switch
that switches like synapses in the brain do. The linear-in-the-state and
nonlinear-in-the-input model is exactly solvable, and it is shown that it also
possesses mathematical properties of convergence and fading memory that enable
stable processing of time-varying inputs by nonlinear dynamical systems. Thus,
the model exhibits the co-existence of biologically-inspired behavior and
desirable mathematical properties for stable learning on sequential data. The
results give theoretical support for the use of the dynamic molecular switches
as computational units in deep cascaded/layered feedforward and recurrent
architectures as well as other more general structures for neuromorphic
computing. They could also inspire more general exactly solvable models that
can be fitted to emulate arbitrary physical devices which can mimic
brain-inspired behaviour and perform stable computation on input signals.

Result: 在MNIST和CIFAR-10的全连接和卷积网络上测试，平均提速2.3倍，最高4.1倍，将24小时分析时间缩短至6小时

Conclusion: BaVerLy通过批量验证策略有效提升了局部鲁棒性验证的效率和可扩展性

Abstract: Neural network image classifiers are ubiquitous in many safety-critical
applications. However, they are susceptible to adversarial attacks. To
understand their robustness to attacks, many local robustness verifiers have
been proposed to analyze $\epsilon$-balls of inputs. Yet, existing verifiers
introduce a long analysis time or lose too much precision, making them less
effective for a large set of inputs. In this work, we propose a new approach to
local robustness: group local robustness verification. The key idea is to
leverage the similarity of the network computations of certain $\epsilon$-balls
to reduce the overall analysis time. We propose BaVerLy, a sound and complete
verifier that boosts the local robustness verification of a set of
$\epsilon$-balls by dynamically constructing and verifying mini-batches.
BaVerLy adaptively identifies successful mini-batch sizes, accordingly
constructs mini-batches of $\epsilon$-balls that have similar network
computations, and verifies them jointly. If a mini-batch is verified, all
$\epsilon$-balls are proven robust. Otherwise, one $\epsilon$-ball is suspected
as not being robust, guiding the refinement. In the latter case, BaVerLy
leverages the analysis results to expedite the analysis of that $\epsilon$-ball
as well as the other $\epsilon$-balls in the batch. We evaluate BaVerLy on
fully connected and convolutional networks for MNIST and CIFAR-10. Results show
that BaVerLy scales the common one by one verification by 2.3x on average and
up to 4.1x, in which case it reduces the total analysis time from 24 hours to 6
hours.

TL;DR: HypSeek是一个双曲表示学习框架，将配体、蛋白质口袋和序列嵌入到Lorentz模型双曲空间中，统一了虚拟筛选和亲和力排序任务，在DUD-E和JACS数据集上分别提升了20.7%和25.4%的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于检索的方法在欧几里得空间中嵌入配体和蛋白质口袋进行相似性搜索，但欧几里得嵌入的几何结构往往无法捕捉分子相互作用中固有的层次结构和细粒度亲和力变化，特别是在活性悬崖等挑战性案例中。

Method: 提出HypSeek框架，利用双曲空间的指数几何和负曲率特性，采用蛋白质引导的三塔架构，将配体、蛋白质口袋和序列嵌入到Lorentz模型双曲空间中，实现表达性强、对亲和力敏感的嵌入表示。

Result: 在DUD-E数据集上，虚拟筛选的早期富集从42.63提升到51.44（+20.7%）；在JACS数据集上，亲和力排序相关性从0.5774提升到0.7239（+25.4%）。

Conclusion: 双曲几何在蛋白质-配体建模中具有强大潜力，能够有效建模全局活性和细微功能差异，特别是在活性悬崖等挑战性案例中表现优异。

Abstract: Protein-ligand binding prediction is central to virtual screening and
affinity ranking, two fundamental tasks in drug discovery. While recent
retrieval-based methods embed ligands and protein pockets into Euclidean space
for similarity-based search, the geometry of Euclidean embeddings often fails
to capture the hierarchical structure and fine-grained affinity variations
intrinsic to molecular interactions. In this work, we propose HypSeek, a
hyperbolic representation learning framework that embeds ligands, protein
pockets, and sequences into Lorentz-model hyperbolic space. By leveraging the
exponential geometry and negative curvature of hyperbolic space, HypSeek
enables expressive, affinity-sensitive embeddings that can effectively model
both global activity and subtle functional differences-particularly in
challenging cases such as activity cliffs, where structurally similar ligands
exhibit large affinity gaps. Our mode unifies virtual screening and affinity
ranking in a single framework, introducing a protein-guided three-tower
architecture to enhance representational structure. HypSeek improves early
enrichment in virtual screening on DUD-E from 42.63 to 51.44 (+20.7%) and
affinity ranking correlation on JACS from 0.5774 to 0.7239 (+25.4%),
demonstrating the benefits of hyperbolic geometry across both tasks and
highlighting its potential as a powerful inductive bias for protein-ligand
modeling.

Conclusion: 通过优化伪任务中的公平性可以有效增强结构公平性，促进跨不同下游应用的公平性泛化。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable success across diverse
applications. However, due to the biases in the graph structures, graph neural
networks face significant challenges in fairness. Although the original user
graph structure is generally biased, it is promising to guide these existing
structures toward unbiased ones by introducing new links. The fairness guidance
via new links could foster unbiased communities, thereby enhancing fairness in
downstream applications. To address this issue, we propose a novel framework
named FairGuide. Specifically, to ensure fairness in downstream tasks trained
on fairness-guided graphs, we introduce a differentiable community detection
task as a pseudo downstream task. Our theoretical analysis further demonstrates
that optimizing fairness within this pseudo task effectively enhances
structural fairness, promoting fairness generalization across diverse
downstream applications. Moreover, FairGuide employs an effective strategy
which leverages meta-gradients derived from the fairness-guidance objective to
identify new links that significantly enhance structural fairness. Extensive
experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of our
proposed method across a variety of graph-based fairness tasks.

Specifically, we focus on designing a novel ADMM-based algorithm that is

the agents perform multiple training epochs between communication rounds, and
ii) compressed transmissions are used. We prove exact linear convergence of the

results by numerical comparisons with state of the art techniques on a

TL;DR: SPOF是一种用于多用户本地差分隐私的稳定扰动损失函数训练机制，通过扰动泰勒展开多项式近似来保护隐私，相比DP-SGD具有更好的计算效率和稳定性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的梯度基隐私保护方法（如DP-SGD）需要在梯度中注入噪声，导致计算效率低且训练不稳定，需要一种更高效稳定的多用户隐私保护训练方法

Method: SPOF通过扰动稳定化的泰勒展开多项式近似来保护隐私，为每个用户的数据添加校准噪声到多项式系数中，而不是在梯度中注入噪声

Result: 在无线体域网场景中，SPOF相比DP-SGD平均重建准确率提高3.5%，训练时间减少57.2%，在异构用户数据和信道噪声环境下表现稳定

Conclusion: SPOF在多用户环境中提供了优越的隐私-效用权衡，具有更好的计算效率、稳定性和对环境噪声的鲁棒性

Abstract: We propose SPOF (Stabilization of Perturbed Loss Function), a differentially
private training mechanism intended for multi-user local differential privacy
(LDP). SPOF perturbs a stabilized Taylor expanded polynomial approximation of a
model's training loss function, where each user's data is privatized by
calibrated noise added to the coefficients of the polynomial. Unlike
gradient-based mechanisms such as differentially private stochastic gradient
descent (DP-SGD), SPOF does not require injecting noise into the gradients of
the loss function, which improves both computational efficiency and stability.
This formulation naturally supports simultaneous privacy guarantees across all
users. Moreover, SPOF exhibits robustness to environmental noise during
training, maintaining stable performance even when user inputs are corrupted.
We compare SPOF with a multi-user extension of DP-SGD, evaluating both methods
in a wireless body area network (WBAN) scenario involving heterogeneous user
data and stochastic channel noise from body sensors. Our results show that SPOF
achieves, on average, up to 3.5% higher reconstruction accuracy and reduces
mean training time by up to 57.2% compared to DP-SGD, demonstrating superior
privacy-utility trade-offs in multi-user environments.

Abstract: This study presents a practical approach for early fault detection in
industrial pump systems using real-world sensor data from a large-scale
vertical centrifugal pump operating in a demanding marine environment. Five key
operational parameters were monitored: vibration, temperature, flow rate,
pressure, and electrical current. A dual-threshold labeling method was applied,
combining fixed engineering limits with adaptive thresholds calculated as the
95th percentile of historical sensor values. To address the rarity of
documented failures, synthetic fault signals were injected into the data using
domain-specific rules, simulating critical alerts within plausible operating
ranges. Three machine learning classifiers - Random Forest, Extreme Gradient
Boosting (XGBoost), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) - were trained to
distinguish between normal operation, early warnings, and critical alerts.
Results showed that Random Forest and XGBoost models achieved high accuracy
across all classes, including minority cases representing rare or emerging
faults, while the SVM model exhibited lower sensitivity to anomalies. Visual
analyses, including grouped confusion matrices and time-series plots, indicated
that the proposed hybrid method provides robust detection capabilities. The
framework is scalable, interpretable, and suitable for real-time industrial
deployment, supporting proactive maintenance decisions before failures occur.
Furthermore, it can be adapted to other machinery with similar sensor
architectures, highlighting its potential as a scalable solution for predictive
maintenance in complex systems.

Abstract: Understanding the nuanced performance of machine learning models is essential
for responsible deployment, especially in high-stakes domains like healthcare
and finance. This paper introduces a novel framework, Conformalized Exceptional
Model Mining, which combines the rigor of Conformal Prediction with the
explanatory power of Exceptional Model Mining (EMM). The proposed framework
identifies cohesive subgroups within data where model performance deviates
exceptionally, highlighting regions of both high confidence and high
uncertainty. We develop a new model class, mSMoPE (multiplex Soft Model
Performance Evaluation), which quantifies uncertainty through conformal
prediction's rigorous coverage guarantees. By defining a new quality measure,
Relative Average Uncertainty Loss (RAUL), our framework isolates subgroups with
exceptional performance patterns in multi-class classification and regression
tasks. Experimental results across diverse datasets demonstrate the framework's
effectiveness in uncovering interpretable subgroups that provide critical
insights into model behavior. This work lays the groundwork for enhancing model
interpretability and reliability, advancing the state-of-the-art in explainable
AI and uncertainty quantification.

Result: 在合成和实际数据集上，包括医学标记物估计，方法性能超过或平等于RoPE和其他标准估计器。

Conclusion: 该方法在具有模型错设的具有挑战性环境中，提供了更好的可扩展性和适用性。

Abstract: Simulation-based inference (SBI) is a statistical inference approach for
estimating latent parameters of a physical system when the likelihood is
intractable but simulations are available. In practice, SBI is often hindered
by model misspecification--the mismatch between simulated and real-world
observations caused by inherent modeling simplifications. RoPE, a recent SBI
approach, addresses this challenge through a two-stage domain transfer process
that combines semi-supervised calibration with optimal transport (OT)-based
distribution alignment. However, RoPE operates in a fully transductive setting,
requiring access to a batch of test samples at inference time, which limits
scalability and generalization. We propose here a fully inductive and amortized
SBI framework that integrates calibration and distributional alignment into a
single, end-to-end trainable model. Our method leverages mini-batch OT with a
closed-form coupling to align real and simulated observations that correspond
to the same latent parameters, using both paired calibration data and unpaired
samples. A conditional normalizing flow is then trained to approximate the
OT-induced posterior, enabling efficient inference without simulation access at
test time. Across a range of synthetic and real-world benchmarks--including
complex medical biomarker estimation--our approach matches or surpasses the
performance of RoPE, as well as other standard SBI and non-SBI estimators,
while offering improved scalability and applicability in challenging,
misspecified environments.

Motivation: 现有动态主题模型需要一次性处理整个训练语料，而在线主题模型虽然能持续更新但缺乏长期记忆，需要一种既能持续学习又能保持长期记忆的主题模型方法。

Method: 使用全局先验分布的持续更新机制，在后续时间步中持续学习主题模型而不遗忘先前学习的内容。

Result: CoNTM在主题质量和预测困惑度方面一致优于动态主题模型，能够在线捕捉主题变化，学习更多样化的主题并更好地捕捉时间变化。

Conclusion: CoNTM填补了持续学习主题模型的空白，通过全局先验分布的持续更新实现了不遗忘的持续学习，在多个指标上优于现有方法。

Abstract: In continual learning, our aim is to learn a new task without forgetting what
was learned previously. In topic models, this translates to learning new topic
models without forgetting previously learned topics. Previous work either
considered Dynamic Topic Models (DTMs), which learn the evolution of topics
based on the entire training corpus at once, or Online Topic Models, which are
updated continuously based on new data but do not have long-term memory. To
fill this gap, we propose the Continual Neural Topic Model (CoNTM), which
continuously learns topic models at subsequent time steps without forgetting
what was previously learned. This is achieved using a global prior distribution
that is continuously updated. In our experiments, CoNTM consistently
outperformed the dynamic topic model in terms of topic quality and predictive
perplexity while being able to capture topic changes online. The analysis
reveals that CoNTM can learn more diverse topics and better capture temporal
changes than existing methods.

Conclusion: GRASPED通过频域编码和解码的独特设计，有效解决了图异常检测中标注数据稀缺和多尺度信息捕获的挑战，为无监督图异常检测提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Graph machine learning has been widely explored in various domains, such as
community detection, transaction analysis, and recommendation systems. In these
applications, anomaly detection plays an important role. Recently, studies have
shown that anomalies on graphs induce spectral shifts. Some supervised methods
have improved the utilization of such spectral domain information. However,
they remain limited by the scarcity of labeled data due to the nature of
anomalies. On the other hand, existing unsupervised learning approaches
predominantly rely on spatial information or only employ low-pass filters,
thereby losing the capacity for multi-band analysis. In this paper, we propose
Graph Autoencoder with Spectral Encoder and Spectral Decoder (GRASPED) for node
anomaly detection. Our unsupervised learning model features an encoder based on
Graph Wavelet Convolution, along with structural and attribute decoders. The
Graph Wavelet Convolution-based encoder, combined with a Wiener Graph
Deconvolution-based decoder, exhibits bandpass filter characteristics that
capture global and local graph information at multiple scales. This design
allows for a learning-based reconstruction of node attributes, effectively
capturing anomaly information. Extensive experiments on several real-world
graph anomaly detection datasets demonstrate that GRASPED outperforms current
state-of-the-art models.

Abstract: With the advent of wearable recorders, scientists are increasingly turning to
automated methods of analysis of audio and video data in order to measure
children's experience, behavior, and outcomes, with a sizable literature
employing long-form audio-recordings to study language acquisition. While
numerous articles report on the accuracy and reliability of the most popular
automated classifiers, less has been written on the downstream effects of
classification errors on measurements and statistical inferences (e.g., the
estimate of correlations and effect sizes in regressions). This paper proposes
a Bayesian approach to study the effects of algorithmic errors on key
scientific questions, including the effect of siblings on children's language
experience and the association between children's production and their input.
In both the most commonly used \gls{lena}, and an open-source alternative (the
Voice Type Classifier from the ACLEW system), we find that classification
errors can significantly distort estimates. For instance, automated annotations
underestimated the negative effect of siblings on adult input by 20--80\%,
potentially placing it below statistical significance thresholds. We further
show that a Bayesian calibration approach for recovering unbiased estimates of
effect sizes can be effective and insightful, but does not provide a fool-proof
solution. Both the issue reported and our solution may apply to any classifier
involving event detection and classification with non-zero error rates.

Result: 实验证明该方法有效，能够产生经验上公平且准确的模型，且比基于认证训练的方法更高效。

Conclusion: 该框架为机器学习训练过程提供了形式化的个体公平性保证，解决了现有方法缺乏理论保证和训练效率低的问题。

Abstract: Fairness in machine learning is more important than ever as ethical concerns
continue to grow. Individual fairness demands that individuals differing only
in sensitive attributes receive the same outcomes. However, commonly used
machine learning algorithms often fail to achieve such fairness. To improve
individual fairness, various training methods have been developed, such as
incorporating fairness constraints as optimisation objectives. While these
methods have demonstrated empirical effectiveness, they lack formal guarantees
of fairness. Existing approaches that aim to provide fairness guarantees
primarily rely on verification techniques, which can sometimes fail to produce
definitive results. Moreover, verification alone does not actively enhance
individual fairness during training. To address this limitation, we propose a
novel framework that formally guarantees individual fairness throughout
training. Our approach consists of two parts, i.e., (1) provably fair
initialisation that ensures the model starts in a fair state, and (2) a
fairness-preserving training algorithm that maintains fairness as the model
learns. A key element of our method is the use of randomised response
mechanisms, which protect sensitive attributes while maintaining fairness
guarantees. We formally prove that this mechanism sustains individual fairness
throughout the training process. Experimental evaluations confirm that our
approach is effective, i.e., producing models that are empirically fair and
accurate. Furthermore, our approach is much more efficient than the alternative
approach based on certified training (which requires neural network
verification during training).

Abstract: Accurate dose-response forecasting under sparse sampling is central to
precision pharmacotherapy. We present the Amortized In-Context Mixed-Effect
Transformer (AICMET) model, a transformer-based latent-variable framework that
unifies mechanistic compartmental priors with amortized in-context Bayesian
inference. AICMET is pre-trained on hundreds of thousands of synthetic
pharmacokinetic trajectories with Ornstein-Uhlenbeck priors over the parameters
of compartment models, endowing the model with strong inductive biases and
enabling zero-shot adaptation to new compounds. At inference time, the decoder
conditions on the collective context of previously profiled trial participants,
generating calibrated posterior predictions for newly enrolled patients after a
few early drug concentration measurements. This capability collapses
traditional model-development cycles from weeks to hours while preserving some
degree of expert modelling. Experiments across public datasets show that AICMET
attains state-of-the-art predictive accuracy and faithfully quantifies
inter-patient variability -- outperforming both nonlinear mixed-effects
baselines and recent neural ODE variants. Our results highlight the feasibility
of transformer-based, population-aware neural architectures as offering a new
alternative for bespoke pharmacokinetic modeling pipelines, charting a path
toward truly population-aware personalized dosing regimens.

Abstract: Effective modeling of heterogeneous subpopulations presents a significant
challenge due to variations in individual characteristics and behaviors. This
paper proposes a novel approach to address this issue through multi-task
learning (MTL) and low-rank tensor decomposition techniques. Our MTL approach
aims to enhance personalized modeling by leveraging shared structures among
similar tasks while accounting for distinct subpopulation-specific variations.
We introduce a framework where low-rank decomposition decomposes the collection
of task model parameters into a low-rank structure that captures commonalities
and variations across tasks and subpopulations. This approach allows for
efficient learning of personalized models by sharing knowledge between similar
tasks while preserving the unique characteristics of each subpopulation.
Experimental results in simulation and case study datasets demonstrate the
superior performance of the proposed method compared to several benchmarks,
particularly in scenarios with high variability among subpopulations. The
proposed framework not only improves prediction accuracy but also enhances
interpretability by revealing underlying patterns that contribute to the
personalization of models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实际世界环境具有多段特性和人类专家，通过社会智能可以加速AI代理的学习，但目前缺乏适合的研究环境。

Method: 设计了一个多段代理环境，允许自利代理追求复杂独立目标，模拟实际挑战。研究社会学习对代理表现的影响。

Result: 环境能够支持隐式合作行为，如联手对抗共同敌人、建造和共享工具、实现长期限目标等。

Conclusion: 该环境为研究开放式多段设置下社会智能AI的发展提供了平台，有助于探索合作与竞争对代理能力的影响。

Abstract: Many challenges remain before AI agents can be deployed in real-world
environments. However, one virtue of such environments is that they are
inherently multi-agent and contain human experts. Using advanced social
intelligence in such an environment can help an AI agent learn adaptive skills
and behaviors that a known expert exhibits. While social intelligence could
accelerate training, it is currently difficult to study due to the lack of
open-ended multi-agent environments. In this work, we present an environment in
which multiple self-interested agents can pursue complex and independent goals,
reflective of real world challenges. This environment will enable research into
the development of socially intelligent AI agents in open-ended multi-agent
settings, where agents may be implicitly incentivized to cooperate to defeat
common enemies, build and share tools, and achieve long horizon goals. In this
work, we investigate the impact on agent performance due to social learning in
the presence of experts and implicit cooperation such as emergent collaborative
tool use, and whether agents can benefit from either cooperation or competition
in this environment.

Abstract: We present several advances to the physics and equality constrained
artificial neural networks (PECANN) framework that substantially improve its
capability to learn solutions of canonical partial differential equations
(PDEs). First, we generalize the augmented Lagrangian method (ALM) to support
multiple independent penalty parameters, enabling simultaneous enforcement of
heterogeneous constraints. Second, we reformulate pointwise constraint
enforcement and Lagrange multipliers as expectations over constraint terms,
reducing memory overhead and permitting efficient mini-batch training. Third,
to address PDEs with oscillatory, multi-scale features, we incorporate Fourier
feature mappings and show that a single mapping suffices where multiple
mappings or more costly architectures were required in related methods. Fourth,
we introduce a time-windowing strategy for long-time evolution in which the
terminal state of each window is enforced as an initial-condition constraint
for the next, ensuring continuity without discrete time models. Crucially, we
propose a conditionally adaptive penalty update (CAPU) strategy for ALM, which
preserves the principle that larger constraint violations incur stronger
penalties. CAPU accelerates the growth of Lagrange multipliers for selectively
challenging constraints, enhancing constraint enforcement during training. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of PECANN-CAPU on problems including the
transonic rarefaction problem, reversible advection of a passive by a vortex,
high-wavenumber Helmholtz and Poisson equations, and inverse identification of
spatially varying heat sources. Comparisons with established methods and recent
Kolmogorov-Arnold network approaches show that PECANN-CAPU achieves competitive
accuracy across all cases. Collectively, these advances improve PECANN's
robustness, efficiency, and applicability to demanding problems in scientific
computing.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文探索了D-Wave量子逆温器与经典MCMC在RBM采样性能上的突出差异，尝试混合采样方法改善训练效果，并首次证明量子采样在减缓灾除忘过程中的应用潜力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解释之前研究中使用D-Wave采样时RBM训练效果不明显的原因，并探索如何利用量子逆温器与经典方法的差异来改善机器学习性能

Method: 提出了一种新的混合采样方法，结合了经典MCMC和量子逆温器的采样贡献，并在灾除忘过问题中测试了量子生成模式的效果

Result: 混合采样方法没有实现RBM训练的显著改善，但首次证明量子逆温器在灾除忘过缩减方面具有应用潜力，生成大量特异模式的速度和效果与经典方法相当

Conclusion: 量子逆温器与MCMC在分布低概率区域的差异不足以改善RBM训练，但在灾除忘过缩减等其他机器学习应用中具有应用前景，速度优势和进一步改善潜力使得该方法对具有挑战性的机器学习任务充满约束

Abstract: Modest statistical differences between the sampling performances of the
D-Wave quantum annealer (QA) and the classical Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC),
when applied to Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs), are explored to explain,
and possibly address, the absence of significant and consistent improvements in
RBM trainability when the D-Wave sampling was used in previous investigations.
A novel hybrid sampling approach, combining the classical and the QA
contributions, is investigated as a promising way to benefit from the modest
differences between the two sampling methods. No improvements in the RBM
training are achieved in this work, thereby suggesting that the differences
between the QA-based and MCMC sampling, mainly found in the medium-to-low
probability regions of the distribution, which are less important for the
quality of the sample, are insufficient to benefit the training. Difficulties
in achieving sufficiently high quality of embedding RBMs into the lattice of
the newer generation of D-Wave hardware could be further complicating the task.
On the other hand, the ability to generate samples of sufficient variety from
lower-probability parts of the distribution has a potential to benefit other
machine learning applications, such as the mitigation of catastrophic
forgetting (CF) during incremental learning. The feasibility of using
QA-generated patterns of desirable classes for CF mitigation by the generative
replay is demonstrated in this work for the first time. While the efficiency of
the CF mitigation using the D-Wave QA was comparable to that of the classical
mitigation, both the speed of generating a large number of distinct desirable
patterns and the potential for further improvement make this approach promising
for a variety of challenging machine learning applications.

*Amir Sarfi,Benjamin Thérien,Joel Lidin,Eugene Belilovsky*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SparseLoCo是一种通信高效的分布式训练算法，通过Top-k稀疏化和2位量化实现高达1-3%的压缩比，在通信受限的LLM训练中优于全精度DiLoCo。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有分布式训练算法在带宽受限环境下仍存在通信瓶颈，即使减少通信频率也需要传输完整梯度副本，且性能略低于基准方法。量化方法在LLM预训练中难以同时利用稀疏化技术。

Method: 结合Top-k稀疏化和量化技术，利用外部动量的局部近似和误差反馈，通过稀疏聚合提升模型性能。

Result: 在多种通信受限的LLM训练场景中，SparseLoCo在性能和通信成本方面均表现出显著优势，压缩比达到1-3%稀疏度和2位量化。

Conclusion: SparseLoCo成功解决了LLM分布式训练中的通信瓶颈问题，通过极端压缩技术实现了通信效率的显著提升，同时保持或超越全精度方法的性能。

Abstract: Communication-efficient distributed training algorithms have received
considerable interest recently due to their benefits for training Large
Language Models (LLMs) in bandwidth-constrained settings, such as across data
centers and over the internet. Despite reducing communication frequency, these
methods still typically require communicating a full copy of the model's
gradients-resulting in a communication bottleneck even for cross-datacenter
links. Furthermore, they can slightly degrade performance compared to a naive
AdamW DDP baseline. While quantization and error feedback are often applied to
reduce the pseudo-gradient's size, in the context of LLM pre-training, existing
approaches have been unable to additionally leverage sparsification and have
obtained limited quantization. In this work, we introduce SparseLoCo, a
communication-efficient training algorithm for LLMs that effectively leverages
Top-k sparsification and quantization to reach extreme compression ratios of up
to 1-3% sparsity and 2-bit quantization while outperforming full-precision
DiLoCo. Our key observations are that outer momentum can be locally
approximated by an error feedback combined with aggressive sparsity and that
sparse aggregation can actually improve model performance. We empirically
demonstrate in a range of communication-constrained LLM training settings that
SparseLoCo provides significant benefits in both performance and communication
cost.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个统一的数学框架，将经典估计理论、统计推断和现代机器学习（包括深度学习和大型语言模型）联系起来，展示了这些方法都基于共同的概率原理来处理不确定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从不确定、嘈杂的数据中提取意义是时间序列分析、模式识别和语言建模中的基本问题。论文旨在建立一个统一的理论框架，揭示不同AI方法背后的共同概率基础。

Method: 通过分析最大似然估计、贝叶斯推断和注意力机制等技术如何处理不确定性，使用系统辨识、图像分类和语言生成等示例场景来说明复杂模型如何在这些基础上构建。

Result: 论文证明了最大似然估计、MAP估计、贝叶斯分类和深度学习都代表了实现共同目标的不同方面：从噪声和/或有偏观测中推断隐藏原因。

Conclusion: 这项工作既是对机器学习的理论综合，也是为学生和研究人员在机器学习不断发展的领域中导航的实用指南，强调了各种方法在概率原理上的统一性。

Abstract: Extracting meaning from uncertain, noisy data is a fundamental problem across
time series analysis, pattern recognition, and language modeling. This survey
presents a unified mathematical framework that connects classical estimation
theory, statistical inference, and modern machine learning, including deep
learning and large language models. By analyzing how techniques such as maximum
likelihood estimation, Bayesian inference, and attention mechanisms address
uncertainty, the paper illustrates that many AI methods are rooted in shared
probabilistic principles. Through illustrative scenarios including system
identification, image classification, and language generation, we show how
increasingly complex models build upon these foundations to tackle practical
challenges like overfitting, data sparsity, and interpretability. In other
words, the work demonstrates that maximum likelihood, MAP estimation, Bayesian
classification, and deep learning all represent different facets of a shared
goal: inferring hidden causes from noisy and/or biased observations. It serves
as both a theoretical synthesis and a practical guide for students and
researchers navigating the evolving landscape of machine learning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文探讨了生成模型中基于似然度的离群检测方法，通过在预训练ResNet-18的表征空间而非像素空间训练变分扩散模型，验证似然度作为OOD检测器的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管似然度在理论上是最优的离群检测器，但先前研究表明其在实践中经常失效。本研究旨在探究这是否是由于生成模型通常使用的像素空间问题，还是表征空间也存在密度估计能力不足的问题。

Method: 在预训练的ResNet-18表征空间上训练变分扩散模型，使用似然度作为OOD检测分数，并与OpenOOD套件中的最先进方法进行比较评估。

Result: 通过在表征空间而非像素空间进行实验，验证了似然度作为OOD检测器的性能表现，并与现有方法进行了对比分析。

Conclusion: 研究表明，选择适当的表征空间对于基于似然度的离群检测至关重要，这为解决先前观察到的似然度失效问题提供了新的视角。

Abstract: Despite rapid advances in AI, safety remains the main bottleneck to deploying
machine-learning systems. A critical safety component is out-of-distribution
detection: given an input, decide whether it comes from the same distribution
as the training data. In generative models, the most natural OOD score is the
data likelihood. Actually, under the assumption of uniformly distributed OOD
data, the likelihood is even the optimal OOD detector, as we show in this work.
However, earlier work reported that likelihood often fails in practice, raising
doubts about its usefulness. We explore whether, in practice, the
representation space also suffers from the inability to learn good density
estimation for OOD detection, or if it is merely a problem of the pixel space
typically used in generative models. To test this, we trained a Variational
Diffusion Model not on images, but on the representation space of a pre-trained
ResNet-18 to assess the performance of our likelihood-based detector in
comparison to state-of-the-art methods from the OpenOOD suite.

Abstract: In recent years, a plethora of open-source foundation models have emerged,
achieving remarkable progress in some widely attended fields, with performance
being quite close to that of closed-source models. However, in high-value but
more challenging scientific professional fields, either the fields still rely
on expert models, or the progress of general foundation models lags
significantly compared to those in popular areas, far from sufficient for
transforming scientific research and leaving substantial gap between
open-source models and closed-source models in these scientific domains. To
mitigate this gap and explore a step further toward Artificial General
Intelligence (AGI), we introduce Intern-S1, a specialized generalist equipped
with general understanding and reasoning capabilities with expertise to analyze
multiple science modal data. Intern-S1 is a multimodal Mixture-of-Experts (MoE)
model with 28 billion activated parameters and 241 billion total parameters,
continually pre-trained on 5T tokens, including over 2.5T tokens from
scientific domains. In the post-training stage, Intern-S1 undergoes offline and
then online reinforcement learning (RL) in InternBootCamp, where we propose
Mixture-of-Rewards (MoR) to synergize the RL training on more than 1000 tasks
simultaneously. Through integrated innovations in algorithms, data, and
training systems, Intern-S1 achieved top-tier performance in online RL
training.On comprehensive evaluation benchmarks, Intern-S1 demonstrates
competitive performance on general reasoning tasks among open-source models and
significantly outperforms open-source models in scientific domains, surpassing
closed-source state-of-the-art models in professional tasks, such as molecular

Motivation: 解决连续动作空间下协作多智能体强化学习面临的对抗攻击检测问题，需要一种仅依赖局部观测的分散式检测方法。

Method: 使用DNN近似智能体正常行为的参数化多元高斯分布，基于预测密度函数定义正态性评分，采用双侧CUSUM程序实时检测评分偏离。

Result: 在多个PettingZoo基准测试中，对最有效攻击的AUC-ROC得分超过0.95，在所有评估环境中优于离散对应方法。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效检测有影响的对抗攻击，在连续动作空间的协作多智能体环境中表现出色。

Abstract: We address the problem of detecting adversarial attacks against cooperative
multi-agent reinforcement learning with continuous action space. We propose a
decentralized detector that relies solely on the local observations of the
agents and makes use of a statistical characterization of the normal behavior
of observable agents. The proposed detector utilizes deep neural networks to
approximate the normal behavior of agents as parametric multivariate Gaussian
distributions. Based on the predicted density functions, we define a normality
score and provide a characterization of its mean and variance. This
characterization allows us to employ a two-sided CUSUM procedure for detecting
deviations of the normality score from its mean, serving as a detector of
anomalous behavior in real-time. We evaluate our scheme on various multi-agent
PettingZoo benchmarks against different state-of-the-art attack methods, and
our results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in detecting impactful
adversarial attacks. Particularly, it outperforms the discrete counterpart by
achieving AUC-ROC scores of over 0.95 against the most impactful attacks in all
evaluated environments.

Abstract: Recent efforts have extended the capabilities of transformers in logical
reasoning and symbolic computations. In this work, we investigate their
capacity for non-linear latent pattern discovery in the context of functional
decomposition, focusing on the challenging algebraic task of multivariate
polynomial decomposition. This problem, with widespread applications in science
and engineering, is proved to be NP-hard, and demands both precision and
insight. Our contributions are threefold: First, we develop a synthetic data
generation pipeline providing fine-grained control over problem complexity.
Second, we train transformer models via supervised learning and evaluate them
across four key dimensions involving scaling behavior and generalizability.
Third, we propose Beam Grouped Relative Policy Optimization (BGRPO), a
rank-aware reinforcement learning method suitable for hard algebraic problems.
Finetuning with BGRPO improves accuracy while reducing beam width by up to
half, resulting in approximately 75% lower inference compute. Additionally, our
model demonstrates competitive performance in polynomial simplification,
outperforming Mathematica in various cases.

TL;DR: 这研究通过信息级联实验分析了大语言模型的社会从众行为，发现信息影响是主要驱动因素，但不确定性会调节其表现方式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大语言模型在协作团队中的社会从众行为，探索其是否与人类心理机制相似，特别是信息影响和规范影响的作用机制。

Method: 采用行为经济学的信息级联实验范式，在医疗、法律和投资三个场景中评估九个领先的LLM，操纵不确定性水平。

Result: 模型在所有场景中都显示以信息影响为主，准确性和信心随着证据增强而提高。但不确定性调节了这一机制：低中不确定性下模型采用保守策略，而高不确定性下模型过度重视公共信号。

Conclusion: 大语言模型的从众行为主要由信息影响驱动，但不确定性导致其行为模式发生重大变化，在高不确定性下显示出类似于规范影响的特征。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) integrate into collaborative teams, their
social conformity -- the tendency to align with majority opinions -- has
emerged as a key concern. In humans, conformity arises from informational
influence (rational use of group cues for accuracy) or normative influence
(social pressure for approval), with uncertainty moderating this balance by
shifting from purely analytical to heuristic processing. It remains unclear
whether these human psychological mechanisms apply to LLMs. This study adapts
the information cascade paradigm from behavioral economics to quantitatively
disentangle the two drivers to investigate the moderate effect. We evaluated
nine leading LLMs across three decision-making scenarios (medical, legal,
investment), manipulating information uncertainty (q = 0.667, 0.55, and 0.70,
respectively). Our results indicate that informational influence underpins the
models' behavior across all contexts, with accuracy and confidence consistently
rising with stronger evidence. However, this foundational mechanism is
dramatically modulated by uncertainty. In low-to-medium uncertainty scenarios,
this informational process is expressed as a conservative strategy, where LLMs
systematically underweight all evidence sources. In contrast, high uncertainty
triggers a critical shift: while still processing information, the models
additionally exhibit a normative-like amplification, causing them to overweight
public signals (beta > 1.55 vs. private beta = 0.81).

Abstract: As Artificial Intelligence (AI) increasingly impacts professional practice,
there is a growing need to AI-related competencies into higher education
curricula. However, research on the implementation of AI education within study
programs remains limited and requires new forms of collaboration across
disciplines. This study addresses this gap and explores perspectives on
interdisciplinary curriculum development through the lens of different
stakeholders. In particular, we examine the case of curriculum development for
a novel undergraduate program in AI in engineering. The research uses a mixed
methods approach, combining quantitative curriculum mapping with qualitative
focus group interviews. In addition to assessing the alignment of the
curriculum with the targeted competencies, the study also examines the
perceived quality, consistency, practicality and effectiveness from both
academic and industry perspectives, as well as differences in perceptions
between educators who were involved in the development and those who were not.
The findings provide a practical understanding of the outcomes of
interdisciplinary AI curriculum development and contribute to a broader
understanding of how educator participation in curriculum development
influences perceptions of quality aspects. It also advances the field of AI
education by providing a reference point and insights for further
interdisciplinary curriculum developments in response to evolving industry
needs.

Motivation: 随着算法在信贷、住房、就业等高风险领域的广泛应用，民事执法行动成为对抗算法歧视的重要工具，但现有算法公平性研究往往无法满足法律调查的实际需求。

Method: 通过分析美国15起民事执法行动（包括监管执法、集体诉讼和个人诉讼），识别算法歧视案件中的实际挑战和研究机会。

Result: 识别出5个关键研究空白：1）寻找同等准确但歧视性更小的算法；2）级联算法偏见；3）量化不同影响；4）应对信息障碍；5）处理缺失受保护群体信息。

Conclusion: 需要开发更符合法律实践需求的工具和方法来加强针对不公平算法的法律行动，为算法公平性研究提供了具体的方向性建议。

Abstract: As algorithms increasingly take on critical roles in high-stakes areas such
as credit scoring, housing, and employment, civil enforcement actions have
emerged as a powerful tool for countering potential discrimination. These legal
actions increasingly draw on algorithmic fairness research to inform questions
such as how to define and detect algorithmic discrimination. However, current
algorithmic fairness research, while theoretically rigorous, often fails to
address the practical needs of legal investigations. We identify and analyze 15
civil enforcement actions in the United States including regulatory
enforcement, class action litigation, and individual lawsuits to identify
practical challenges in algorithmic discrimination cases that machine learning
research can help address. Our analysis reveals five key research gaps within
existing algorithmic bias research, presenting practical opportunities for more
aligned research: 1) finding an equally accurate and less discriminatory
algorithm, 2) cascading algorithmic bias, 3) quantifying disparate impact, 4)
navigating information barriers, and 5) handling missing protected group
information. We provide specific recommendations for developing tools and
methodologies that can strengthen legal action against unfair algorithms.

Abstract: Improving artificial intelligence (AI) literacy has become an important
consideration for academia and industry with the widespread adoption of AI
technologies. Collaborative learning (CL) approaches have proven effective for
information literacy, and in this study, we investigate the effectiveness of CL
in improving AI knowledge and skills. We systematically collected data to
create a corpus of nine studies from 2015-2023. We used the
Interactive-Constructive-Active-Passive (ICAP) framework to theoretically
analyze the CL outcomes for AI literacy reported in each. Findings suggest that
CL effectively increases AI literacy across a range of activities, settings,
and groups of learners. While most studies occurred in classroom settings, some
aimed to broaden participation by involving educators and families or using AI
agents to support teamwork. Additionally, we found that instructional
activities included all the ICAP modes. We draw implications for future
research and teaching.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解学生如何、为何学习AI，以便正规教育能更好地支持他们的AI素养发展，包括意识、知识、应用、评估和发展五个能力维度

Method: 进行为期六周的反思日志研究，让学生每周描述与AI的互动，采用涌现式解释过程分析数据

Result: 参与者意识到AI的存在，对未来AI技能应用表达看法，对深度学习AI专业知识表现出矛盾情感，描述AI使用的伦理担忧，并视自己为朋友家人的知识中介

Conclusion: 研究揭示了学生对AI学习的复杂态度和认知，为未来AI教育提供了重要启示，建议进一步探索如何更好地支持学生的AI素养发展

Abstract: This research paper presents a study of undergraduate technology students'
self-reflective learning about artificial intelligence (AI). Research on AI
literacy proposes that learners must develop five competencies associated with
AI: awareness, knowledge, application, evaluation, and development. It is
important to understand what, how, and why students learn about AI so formal
instruction can better support their learning. We conducted a reflective
journal study where students described their interactions with AI each week.
Data was collected over six weeks and analyzed using an emergent interpretive
process. We found that the participants were aware of AI, expressed opinions on
their future use of AI skills, and conveyed conflicted feelings about
developing deep AI expertise. They also described ethical concerns with AI use
and saw themselves as intermediaries of knowledge for friends and family. We
present the implications of this study and propose ideas for future work in
this area.

TL;DR: 本文分析了人工智能多边主义的两个关键特征：通用原则和协调机制，指出虽然AI多边主义涉及多方利益相关者，但国家仍保持决策主导地位。


<details>

Motivation: 探讨国际多边主义如何应对通用人工智能技术的出现，分析AI多边主义的特征和运作机制。

Method: 通过区分AI多边主义的通用原则（时代变革、决定论、辩证理解）和考察现有合作框架的适应性调整来展开分析。

Result: 发现AI多边主义在国家与非国家行为体关系层级下发展，国家在议程设置、谈判和执行软法国际承诺方面保持决定性决策能力。

Conclusion: 尽管AI多边主义呈现多方参与特征，但国家仍然是关键决策者，在多边治理结构中保持核心地位。

Abstract: This chapter inquires how international multilateralism addresses the
emergence of the general-purpose technology of Artificial Intelligence. In more
detail, it analyses two key features of AI multilateralism: its generalized
principles and the coordination of state relations in the realm of AI. Firstly,
it distinguishes the generalized principles of AI multilateralism of epochal
change, determinism, and dialectical understanding. In the second place, the
adaptation of multilateralism to AI led to the integration of AI issues into
the agendas of existing cooperation frameworks and the creation of new ad hoc
frameworks focusing exclusively on AI issues. In both cases, AI multilateralism
develops in the shadow of the state hierarchy in relations with other AI
stakeholders. While AI multilateralism is multi-stakeholder, and the hierarchy
between state and non-state actors may seem blurred, states preserve the
competence as decisive decision-makers in agenda-setting, negotiation, and
implementation of soft law international commitments.

*André Felipe Zanella,Linus W. Dietz,Sanja Šćepanović,Ke Zhou,Zbigniew Smoreda,Daniele Quercia*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 本研究通过分析移动基站数据和应用程序使用模式，提出了一种量化城市公园功能的新方法，识别出午餐休息型、文化型和休闲型三种公园功能类型，并验证了中心城区假说和社会空间假说。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注公园的形式特征，对功能研究受限于小规模调查和粗粒度测量，无法捕捉公园访问背后的活动和动机，导致对城市公园功能角色的理解不完整。

Method: 通过优化移动基站天线方位角覆盖范围，清晰区分公园内外的移动流量；分析巴黎45个公园的4.92亿条小时级应用程序使用记录，基于时间和应用使用模式进行聚类分析。

Result: 公园具有独特的移动流量特征，聚类识别出三种功能类型：午餐休息型（工作时间使用）、文化型（多样化应用使用）和休闲型（反映社区数字行为）；中心城区公园显示更多样化的应用使用和时间变化。

Conclusion: 移动流量数据可作为研究城市绿地功能的有效代理指标，研究结果对公园规划、公共健康和福祉具有重要意义，证明了数字行为数据在城市研究中的价值。

Abstract: Landscape architecture typically considers urban parks through the lens of
form and function. While past research on equitable access has focused mainly
on form, studies of functions have been constrained by limited scale and coarse
measurement. Existing efforts have partially quantified functions through
small-scale surveys and movement data (e.g., GPS) or general usage records
(e.g., CDR), but have not captured the activities and motivations underlying
park visits. As a result, our understanding of the functional roles urban parks
play remains incomplete. To address this gap, we introduce a method that
refines mobile base station coverage using antenna azimuths, enabling clearer
distinction of mobile traffic within parks versus surrounding areas. Using
Paris as a case study, we analyze a large-scale set of passively collected
per-app mobile network traffic - 492 million hourly records for 45 parks. We
test two hypotheses: the central-city hypothesis, which posits multifunctional
parks emerge in dense, high-rent areas due to land scarcity; and the
socio-spatial hypothesis, which views parks as reflections of neighborhood
routines and preferences. Our analysis shows that parks have distinctive mobile
traffic signatures, differing from both their surroundings and from each other.
By clustering parks on temporal and app usage patterns, we identify three
functional types - lunchbreak, cultural, and recreational - with different
visitation motivations. Centrally located parks (cultural and lunchbreak)
display more diverse app use and temporal variation, while suburban
(recreational) parks reflect digital behaviors of nearby communities, with app
preferences aligned to neighborhood income. These findings demonstrate the
value of mobile traffic as a proxy for studying urban green space functions,
with implications for park planning, public health, and well-being.

### [164] [A Fully Spectral Neuro-Symbolic Reasoning Architecture with Graph Signal Processing as the Computational Backbone](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14923)
*Andrew Kiruluta*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种完全基于频谱的神经符号推理架构，使用图信号处理作为核心计算框架，将整个推理流程置于图频谱域中处理，在多个基准数据集上表现出优于现有方法的逻辑一致性和计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统神经符号模型通常将频谱图方法作为外围组件，而本文旨在通过将整个推理流程完全置于图频谱域中，实现符号逻辑与神经推理的更深度整合，提供数学基础更扎实且计算高效的推理系统。

Method: 将逻辑实体和关系编码为图信号，通过可学习的频谱滤波器控制多尺度信息传播，然后映射到符号谓词进行基于规则的推理。包括图傅里叶变换、频带选择性注意力和频谱规则接地等完整数学框架。

Result: 在ProofWriter、EntailmentBank、bAbI、CLUTRR和ARC-Challenge等基准推理数据集上的实验表明，相比最先进的神经符号模型，在逻辑一致性、可解释性和计算效率方面都有提升。

Conclusion: 图信号处理为构建鲁棒且可解释的推理系统提供了数学基础扎实且计算高效的底层支持，证明了完全频谱推理架构的有效性。

Abstract: We propose a fully spectral, neuro\-symbolic reasoning architecture that
leverages Graph Signal Processing (GSP) as the primary computational backbone
for integrating symbolic logic and neural inference. Unlike conventional
reasoning models that treat spectral graph methods as peripheral components,
our approach formulates the entire reasoning pipeline in the graph spectral
domain. Logical entities and relationships are encoded as graph signals,
processed via learnable spectral filters that control multi-scale information
propagation, and mapped into symbolic predicates for rule-based inference. We
present a complete mathematical framework for spectral reasoning, including
graph Fourier transforms, band-selective attention, and spectral rule
grounding. Experiments on benchmark reasoning datasets (ProofWriter,
EntailmentBank, bAbI, CLUTRR, and ARC-Challenge) demonstrate improvements in
logical consistency, interpretability, and computational efficiency over
state\-of\-the\-art neuro\-symbolic models. Our results suggest that GSP
provides a mathematically grounded and computationally efficient substrate for
robust and interpretable reasoning systems.

### [165] [Goals and the Structure of Experience](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15013)
*Nadav Amir,Stas Tiomkin,Angela Langdon*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个基于目标导向状态表示的计算框架，其中描述性和规范性方面从智能体-环境交互序列中共同涌现，而不是传统强化学习中分离的状态表示和奖励函数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统计算模型（如强化学习）将世界模型分为描述性状态表示和规范性奖励函数两个独立组件，但作者认为这两个方面可能从智能体目标中相互依赖地共同涌现，这一可能性尚未被计算化建模。

Method: 引入佛教认识论中的目标导向（telic）状态概念，定义为目标等价经验分布的类别。通过统计散度来衡量行为策略与期望经验特征之间的差异，提供目标导向学习的简约解释。

Result: 提出了一个统一的计算框架，能够解释行为、现象学和神经维度上的目的性行为，支持描述性和规范性方面的共同涌现理论。

Conclusion: 目标导向状态表示框架为理解跨不同基质的目性行为提供了新的理论基础，挑战了传统分离式世界模型的观点，强调描述性和规范性方面的内在关联性。

Abstract: Purposeful behavior is a hallmark of natural and artificial intelligence. Its
acquisition is often believed to rely on world models, comprising both
descriptive (what is) and prescriptive (what is desirable) aspects that
identify and evaluate state of affairs in the world, respectively. Canonical
computational accounts of purposeful behavior, such as reinforcement learning,
posit distinct components of a world model comprising a state representation
(descriptive aspect) and a reward function (prescriptive aspect). However, an
alternative possibility, which has not yet been computationally formulated, is
that these two aspects instead co-emerge interdependently from an agent's goal.
Here, we describe a computational framework of goal-directed state
representation in cognitive agents, in which the descriptive and prescriptive
aspects of a world model co-emerge from agent-environment interaction
sequences, or experiences. Drawing on Buddhist epistemology, we introduce a
construct of goal-directed, or telic, states, defined as classes of
goal-equivalent experience distributions. Telic states provide a parsimonious
account of goal-directed learning in terms of the statistical divergence
between behavioral policies and desirable experience features. We review
empirical and theoretical literature supporting this novel perspective and
discuss its potential to provide a unified account of behavioral,
phenomenological and neural dimensions of purposeful behaviors across diverse
substrates.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Collab-REC是一个多智能体框架，使用三个LLM智能体从不同角度生成旅游推荐，通过协商机制提升推荐多样性和平衡性，有效缓解流行度偏见。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决旅游推荐系统中的流行度偏见问题，避免过度旅游，提升推荐多样性，让更多小众景点得到关注。

Method: 使用三个基于LLM的智能体（个性化、流行度、可持续性）从不同角度生成城市建议，然后通过非LLM调解器进行多轮协商和精炼。

Result: 在欧洲城市查询实验中，相比单智能体基线，Collab-REC提高了推荐多样性和整体相关性，能够推荐更多被忽视的小众地点。

Conclusion: 多利益相关者协作的LLM驱动推荐系统具有很大潜力，能够提供更平衡、上下文感知的推荐，更好地满足用户约束条件。

Abstract: We propose Collab-REC, a multi-agent framework designed to counteract
popularity bias and enhance diversity in tourism recommendations. In our
setting, three LLM-based agents -- Personalization, Popularity, and
Sustainability generate city suggestions from complementary perspectives. A
non-LLM moderator then merges and refines these proposals via multi-round
negotiation, ensuring each agent's viewpoint is incorporated while penalizing
spurious or repeated responses. Experiments on European city queries show that
Collab-REC improves diversity and overall relevance compared to a single-agent
baseline, surfacing lesser-visited locales that often remain overlooked. This
balanced, context-aware approach addresses over-tourism and better aligns with
constraints provided by the user, highlighting the promise of multi-stakeholder
collaboration in LLM-driven recommender systems.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于大语言模型(LLMs)的群体动画方法，通过对话系统和语言驱动导航来控制智能体运动，使群体行为更加真实自然。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有群体动画方法主要关注转向和高层目标推断，忽略了语言对话对人群导航和运动的重要影响，缺乏复杂的社会和环境交互。

Method: 使用基于智能体的LLMs系统，结合角色个性、欲望和关系生成智能体间对话，并利用对话内容、个性、情感状态、视觉和物理状态来控制每个智能体的导航和转向。

Result: 在复杂场景中验证了方法有效性，观察到智能体自动分组和解组，方法可作为群体内的信息传递机制，产生更真实的群体模拟和自然涌现的群体行为。

Conclusion: 该方法通过整合语言对话和感知输入，显著提升了群体动画的真实性，能够自然产生基于环境设置的涌现性群体行为。

Abstract: Animating and simulating crowds using an agent-based approach is a
well-established area where every agent in the crowd is individually controlled
such that global human-like behaviour emerges. We observe that human navigation
and movement in crowds are often influenced by complex social and environmental
interactions, driven mainly by language and dialogue. However, most existing
work does not consider these dimensions and leads to animations where
agent-agent and agent-environment interactions are largely limited to steering
and fixed higher-level goal extrapolation.
  We propose a novel method that exploits large language models (LLMs) to
control agents' movement. Our method has two main components: a dialogue system
and language-driven navigation. We periodically query agent-centric LLMs
conditioned on character personalities, roles, desires, and relationships to
control the generation of inter-agent dialogue when necessitated by the spatial
and social relationships with neighbouring agents. We then use the conversation
and each agent's personality, emotional state, vision, and physical state to
control the navigation and steering of each agent. Our model thus enables
agents to make motion decisions based on both their perceptual inputs and the
ongoing dialogue.
  We validate our method in two complex scenarios that exemplify the interplay
between social interactions, steering, and crowding. In these scenarios, we
observe that grouping and ungrouping of agents automatically occur.
Additionally, our experiments show that our method serves as an
information-passing mechanism within the crowd. As a result, our framework
produces more realistic crowd simulations, with emergent group behaviours
arising naturally from any environmental setting.

*Romain Lacombe,Kerrie Wu,Eddie Dilworth*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 这篇论文通过系统评估发现，超长的思考预算会导致大语言模型自信心过度，而不是提高准确性，搜索增强生成能够显著改善自信心检测的准确度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大语言模型在问题回答任务中的自信心检测准确性，并识别信息访问而非推理深度或计算预算是改善自信心检测的关键瓶颈。

Method: 使用ClimateX数据集并扩展到人类和地球健康预监，系统评估推理能力和计算预算对自信心检测准确性的影响，对比纯推理与搜索增强生成的效果。

Result: 推理模型在专家自信心评估中仅获得48.7%准确性，增加推理预算反而导致系统性过度自信；搜索增强生成达到89.3%准确性，显著优于纯推理方式。

Conclusion: 信息访问能力是改善大语言模型自信心检测的关键因素，过长的推理预算会导致负面效果，而搜索和知识获取能够实现更好的自信心检测性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models deployed as question answering tools require robust
calibration to avoid overconfidence. We systematically evaluate how reasoning
capabilities and budget affect confidence assessment accuracy, using the
ClimateX dataset (Lacombe et al., 2023) and expanding it to human and planetary
health. Our key finding challenges the "test-time scaling" paradigm: while
recent reasoning LLMs achieve 48.7% accuracy in assessing expert confidence,
increasing reasoning budgets consistently impairs rather than improves
calibration. Extended reasoning leads to systematic overconfidence that worsens
with longer thinking budgets, producing diminishing and negative returns beyond
modest computational investments. Conversely, search-augmented generation
dramatically outperforms pure reasoning, achieving 89.3% accuracy by retrieving
relevant evidence. Our results suggest that information access, rather than
reasoning depth or inference budget, may be the critical bottleneck for
improved confidence calibration of knowledge-intensive tasks.

TL;DR: S3LoRA是一个轻量级、无需数据、模型无关的框架，通过分析LoRA微调权重更新来缓解安全风险，使用MAS-SVD分析结构特性和SSI指标检测危险层，通过剪枝提高安全性同时保持任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LoRA的参数高效微调方法在增强LLM智能体能力的同时，可能会无意中破坏安全对齐，导致不安全行为。现有安全感知适应方法需要访问基础模型和指令微调检查点，这在实践中往往不可用。

Method: 提出S3LoRA框架：1) MAS-SVD方法分析LoRA更新结构特性并保留全局幅度信息；2) SSI尖锐度感知指标检测高度集中且可能不安全的更新层；3) 对危险层进行后剪枝处理。

Result: 在智能体规划和语言生成任务上的广泛实验表明，S3LoRA持续改善安全指标，同时保持或改善效用指标，并显著降低推理成本。

Conclusion: S3LoRA为在现实世界、资源受限和安全关键环境中安全部署基于LLM的智能体提供了实用且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Adapting Large Language Models (LLMs) using parameter-efficient fine-tuning
(PEFT) techniques such as LoRA has enabled powerful capabilities in LLM-based
agents. However, these adaptations can unintentionally compromise safety
alignment, leading to unsafe or unstable behaviors, particularly in agent
planning tasks. Existing safety-aware adaptation methods often require access
to both base and instruction-tuned model checkpoints, which are frequently
unavailable in practice, limiting their applicability. We propose S3LoRA (Safe
Spectral Sharpness-Guided Pruning LoRA), a lightweight, data-free, and
model-independent framework that mitigates safety risks in LoRA-adapted models
by inspecting only the fine-tuned weight updates. We first introduce
Magnitude-Aware Spherically Normalized SVD (MAS-SVD), which robustly analyzes
the structural properties of LoRA updates while preserving global magnitude
information. We then design the Spectral Sharpness Index (SSI), a
sharpness-aware metric to detect layers with highly concentrated and
potentially unsafe updates. These layers are pruned post-hoc to reduce risk
without sacrificing task performance. Extensive experiments and ablation
studies across agent planning and language generation tasks show that S3LoRA
consistently improves safety metrics while maintaining or improving utility
metrics and significantly reducing inference cost. These results establish
S3LoRA as a practical and scalable solution for safely deploying LLM-based
agents in real-world, resource-constrained, and safety-critical environments.

Abstract: Workforce management is a complex problem optimising the makespan and travel
distance required for a team of operators to complete a set of jobs, using a

accommodate change and obtain faithful explanations. We show, with a user
study, that our tool and explanations lead to faster and more accurate problem
solving than conventional solutions by hand.

Result: 在基于文本的杂货购物领域和AI2Thor模拟家庭机器人环境中，使用合成用户配置文件进行评估，GOOD方法在LLM和人类评估中都优于没有显式目标跟踪的基线

Conclusion: GOOD方法能够实现丰富的目标表示和不确定性估计，无需大型离线数据集，在开放宇宙辅助游戏中表现出色

Abstract: Embodied AI agents must infer and act in an interpretable way on diverse
human goals and preferences that are not predefined. To formalize this setting,
we introduce Open-Universe Assistance Games (OU-AGs), a framework where the
agent must reason over an unbounded and evolving space of possible goals. In
this context, we introduce GOOD (GOals from Open-ended Dialogue), a
data-efficient, online method that extracts goals in the form of natural
language during an interaction with a human, and infers a distribution over
natural language goals. GOOD prompts an LLM to simulate users with different
complex intents, using its responses to perform probabilistic inference over
candidate goals. This approach enables rich goal representations and
uncertainty estimation without requiring large offline datasets. We evaluate
GOOD in a text-based grocery shopping domain and in a text-operated simulated
household robotics environment (AI2Thor), using synthetic user profiles. Our
method outperforms a baseline without explicit goal tracking, as confirmed by
both LLM-based and human evaluations.

Conclusion: aiXiv为AI科学家建立了新一代开放获取生态系统的基础，加速了高质量AI生成研究内容的发表和传播，推动了自主科学发现的发展。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled AI agents to
autonomously generate scientific proposals, conduct experiments, author papers,
and perform peer reviews. Yet this flood of AI-generated research content
collides with a fragmented and largely closed publication ecosystem.
Traditional journals and conferences rely on human peer review, making them
difficult to scale and often reluctant to accept AI-generated research content;
existing preprint servers (e.g. arXiv) lack rigorous quality-control
mechanisms. Consequently, a significant amount of high-quality AI-generated
research lacks appropriate venues for dissemination, hindering its potential to
advance scientific progress. To address these challenges, we introduce aiXiv, a
next-generation open-access platform for human and AI scientists. Its
multi-agent architecture allows research proposals and papers to be submitted,
reviewed, and iteratively refined by both human and AI scientists. It also
provides API and MCP interfaces that enable seamless integration of
heterogeneous human and AI scientists, creating a scalable and extensible
ecosystem for autonomous scientific discovery. Through extensive experiments,
we demonstrate that aiXiv is a reliable and robust platform that significantly
enhances the quality of AI-generated research proposals and papers after
iterative revising and reviewing on aiXiv. Our work lays the groundwork for a
next-generation open-access ecosystem for AI scientists, accelerating the
publication and dissemination of high-quality AI-generated research content.

performance to 73.3 on AndroidWorld and 37.7 on OSWorld, setting a new
state-of-the-art for open-source GUI agent frameworks. GUI-Owl incorporates
three key innovations: (1) Large-scale Environment Infrastructure: a
cloud-based virtual environment spanning Android, Ubuntu, macOS, and Windows,
enabling our Self-Evolving GUI Trajectory Production framework. This generates
high-quality interaction data via automated query generation and correctness
validation, leveraging GUI-Owl to refine trajectories iteratively, forming a
self-improving loop. It supports diverse data pipelines and reduces manual
annotation. (2) Diverse Foundational Agent Capabilities: by integrating UI
grounding, planning, action semantics, and reasoning patterns, GUI-Owl supports
end-to-end decision-making and can act as a modular component in multi-agent
systems. (3) Scalable Environment RL: we develop a scalable reinforcement
learning framework with fully asynchronous training for real-world alignment.
We also introduce Trajectory-aware Relative Policy Optimization (TRPO) for
online RL, achieving 34.9 on OSWorld. GUI-Owl and Mobile-Agent-v3 are

TL;DR: PuzzleClone是一个基于SMT的形式化框架，用于大规模生成可验证的数学逻辑谜题数据集，通过训练显著提升了LLM在逻辑推理任务上的表现


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM生成的数据集存在可靠性、多样性和可扩展性有限的问题，需要高质量可验证的数学逻辑数据集来增强大语言模型的推理能力

Method: 使用SMT将种子谜题编码为结构化逻辑规范，通过系统变量和约束随机化生成可扩展变体，并通过复制机制确保有效性

Result: 构建了包含83K+多样化谜题的基准测试集，训练后PuzzleClone平均准确率从14.4提升到56.2，在7个逻辑数学基准上获得最高12.5个百分点的提升

Conclusion: PuzzleClone框架能够有效生成大规模可验证的逻辑数学数据，显著提升LLM的推理能力，为解决数据可靠性问题提供了有效方案

Abstract: High-quality mathematical and logical datasets with verifiable answers are
essential for strengthening the reasoning capabilities of large language models
(LLMs). While recent data augmentation techniques have facilitated the creation
of large-scale benchmarks, existing LLM-generated datasets often suffer from
limited reliability, diversity, and scalability. To address these challenges,
we introduce PuzzleClone, a formal framework for synthesizing verifiable data
at scale using Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT). Our approach features
three key innovations: (1) encoding seed puzzles into structured logical
specifications, (2) generating scalable variants through systematic variable
and constraint randomization, and (3) ensuring validity via a reproduction
mechanism. Applying PuzzleClone, we construct a curated benchmark comprising
over 83K diverse and programmatically validated puzzles. The generated puzzles
span a wide spectrum of difficulty and formats, posing significant challenges
to current state-of-the-art models. We conduct post training (SFT and RL) on
PuzzleClone datasets. Experimental results show that training on PuzzleClone
yields substantial improvements not only on PuzzleClone testset but also on
logic and mathematical benchmarks. Post training raises PuzzleClone average
from 14.4 to 56.2 and delivers consistent improvements across 7 logic and
mathematical benchmarks up to 12.5 absolute percentage points (AMC2023 from
52.5 to 65.0). Our code and data are available at

TL;DR: LLM4Sweat是一个针对罕见病多汗症的开源LLM框架，通过数据增强、微调和专家评估三阶段流程，提供可信赖且富有同理心的医疗支持


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在医疗领域的应用受到罕见病数据稀缺和不可靠的限制，多汗症作为影响2-3%人群的罕见病，目前缺乏专门的LLM支持

Method: 采用三阶段流程：1) 使用前沿LLM从开源数据生成医学上合理的合成病例；2) 在开源基础模型上进行微调；3) 临床和心理专家评估准确性、适当性和同理心

Result: LLM4Sweat在实验中优于基线模型，提供了首个针对多汗症的开源LLM框架，并为其他具有类似数据挑战的罕见病提供了可推广的方法

Conclusion: 该研究成功开发了专门针对多汗症的LLM框架，解决了罕见病数据稀缺问题，为其他罕见病的LLM应用提供了可行的技术路径

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in healthcare, their
application for rare medical conditions is still hindered by scarce and
unreliable datasets for fine-tuning. Hyperhidrosis, a disorder causing
excessive sweating beyond physiological needs, is one such rare disorder,
affecting 2-3% of the population and significantly impacting both physical
comfort and psychosocial well-being. To date, no work has tailored LLMs to
advance the diagnosis or care of hyperhidrosis. To address this gap, we present
LLM4Sweat, an open-source and domain-specific LLM framework for trustworthy and
empathetic hyperhidrosis support. The system follows a three-stage pipeline. In
the data augmentation stage, a frontier LLM generates medically plausible
synthetic vignettes from curated open-source data to create a diverse and
balanced question-answer dataset. In the fine-tuning stage, an open-source
foundation model is fine-tuned on the dataset to provide diagnosis,
personalized treatment recommendations, and empathetic psychological support.
In the inference and expert evaluation stage, clinical and psychological
specialists assess accuracy, appropriateness, and empathy, with validated
responses iteratively enriching the dataset. Experiments show that LLM4Sweat
outperforms baselines and delivers the first open-source LLM framework for
hyperhidrosis, offering a generalizable approach for other rare diseases with
similar data and trustworthiness challenges.

*Raj Jain,Marc Wetter*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: R-ConstraintBench是一个评估大语言模型在资源约束项目调度问题(RCPSP)中推理能力的框架，通过逐步增加约束复杂度来测试模型性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前对大语言模型在高度约束环境下的推理可靠性研究不足，特别是在资源、时间和操作约束严格的大规模规划场景中

Method: 构建可扩展的R-ConstraintBench框架，在DAG中逐步增加非冗余的前序约束，然后引入停机时间、时间窗口和分离约束，并在数据中心迁移场景中进行实例化评估

Result: 强模型在仅有前序约束的DAG上表现接近上限，但当停机时间、时间窗口和分离约束相互作用时，可行性性能崩溃，约束交互是主要瓶颈而非图深度

Conclusion: 模型在干净合成数据上的性能不能保证在领域场景中的迁移，表明大语言模型在约束推理方面的泛化能力有限

Abstract: Effective scheduling under tight resource, timing, and operational
constraints underpins large-scale planning across sectors such as capital
projects, manufacturing, logistics, and IT fleet transitions. However, the
reliability of large language models (LLMs) when reasoning under
high-constraint regimes is insufficiently characterized. To address this gap,
we present R-ConstraintBench, a scalable framework that evaluates models on
Resource-Constrained Project Scheduling Problems (RCPSP), an NP-Complete
feasibility class, while difficulty increases via linear growth in constraints.
R-ConstraintBench incrementally increases non-redundant precedence constraints
in Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) and then introduces downtime, temporal
windows, and disjunctive constraints. As an illustrative example, we
instantiate the benchmark in a data center migration setting and evaluate
multiple LLMs using feasibility and error analysis, identifying degradation
thresholds and constraint types most associated with failure. Empirically,
strong models are near-ceiling on precedence-only DAGs, but feasibility
performance collapses when downtime, temporal windows, and disjunctive
constraints interact, implicating constraint interaction, not graph depth, as
the principal bottleneck. Performance on clean synthetic ramps also does not
guarantee transfer to domain-grounded scenarios, underscoring limited
generalization.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出See it. Say it. Sorted.系统，通过VLM和LLM的协同工作，将手绘草图转换为精确的可编辑SVG图表，解决了扩散模型在空间精度和符号结构方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在生成逼真图像方面表现出色，但在处理流程图等需要精确空间对齐和符号结构的图表时存在困难，需要一种能够保持布局精度和全局约束的方法。

Method: 采用训练免费的代理系统，结合视觉语言模型(VLM)和大型语言模型(LLM)，通过迭代循环：批判VLM提出定性编辑建议，多个候选LLM生成不同的SVG更新策略，评判VLM选择最佳候选，确保稳定改进。

Result: 在10个来自已发表论文的流程图草图测试中，该方法比GPT-5和Gemini-2.5-Pro等前沿闭源图像生成LLM更准确地重建布局和结构，能够精确组合图元而不插入不需要的文本。

Conclusion: 该方法生成程序化的SVG输出，易于通过API扩展到演示工具，可通过改进提示和任务特定工具进行专门化，代码已开源。

Abstract: We study sketch-to-diagram generation: converting rough hand sketches into
precise, compositional diagrams. Diffusion models excel at photorealism but
struggle with the spatial precision, alignment, and symbolic structure required
for flowcharts. We introduce See it. Say it. Sorted., a training-free agentic
system that couples a Vision-Language Model (VLM) with Large Language Models
(LLMs) to produce editable Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) programs. The system
runs an iterative loop in which a Critic VLM proposes a small set of
qualitative, relational edits; multiple candidate LLMs synthesize SVG updates
with diverse strategies (conservative->aggressive, alternative, focused); and a
Judge VLM selects the best candidate, ensuring stable improvement. This design
prioritizes qualitative reasoning over brittle numerical estimates, preserves
global constraints (e.g., alignment, connectivity), and naturally supports
human-in-the-loop corrections. On 10 sketches derived from flowcharts in
published papers, our method more faithfully reconstructs layout and structure
than two frontier closed-source image generation LLMs (GPT-5 and
Gemini-2.5-Pro), accurately composing primitives (e.g., multi-headed arrows)
without inserting unwanted text. Because outputs are programmatic SVGs, the
approach is readily extensible to presentation tools (e.g., PowerPoint) via
APIs and can be specialized with improved prompts and task-specific tools. The
codebase is open-sourced at

Conclusion: 约束松弛技术能够在保持实际约束的同时实现更广泛的解空间探索，为城市规划者和政策制定者提供基于证据的计算工具，支持快速城市化地区更有效的城市发展政策。

Abstract: Urban land-use allocation represents a complex multi-objective optimization
problem critical for sustainable urban development policy. This paper presents
novel computational intelligence approaches for optimizing land-use allocation
in mixed-use areas, addressing inherent trade-offs between land-use
compatibility and economic objectives. We develop multiple optimization
algorithms, including custom variants integrating differential evolution with
multi-objective genetic algorithms. Key contributions include: (1) CR+DES
algorithm leveraging scaled difference vectors for enhanced exploration, (2)
systematic constraint relaxation strategy improving solution quality while
maintaining feasibility, and (3) statistical validation using Kruskal-Wallis
tests with compact letter displays. Applied to a real-world case study with
1,290 plots, CR+DES achieves 3.16\% improvement in land-use compatibility
compared to state-of-the-art methods, while MSBX+MO excels in price
optimization with 3.3\% improvement. Statistical analysis confirms algorithms
incorporating difference vectors significantly outperform traditional
approaches across multiple metrics. The constraint relaxation technique enables
broader solution space exploration while maintaining practical constraints.
These findings provide urban planners and policymakers with evidence-based
computational tools for balancing competing objectives in land-use allocation,
supporting more effective urban development policies in rapidly urbanizing
regions.

TL;DR: 基于认知心理学理论的多重记忆系统(MMS)，通过将短期记忆处理成多个长期记忆片段，构建检索记忆单元和上下文记忆单元，提高了记忆质量和回忆性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有记忆模块方法(如MemoryBank、A-MEM)存储的记忆内容质量差，影响回忆性能和响应质量，需要更好地处理大量历史交互数据。

Method: 设计受认知心理学启发的多重记忆系统(MMS)，将短期记忆处理成多个长期记忆片段，构建检索记忆单元和上下文记忆单元，两者一一对应。在检索阶段匹配相关检索记忆单元，获取对应上下文记忆作为响应背景。

Result: 在LoCoMo数据集上与三种方法进行对比实验，证明了方法的有效性。消融实验确认了记忆单元的合理性，分析了选择记忆段数量和存储开销的稳健性。

Conclusion: MMS系统能够构建高质量的长期记忆内容，有效利用历史数据，提高了回忆性能和响应质量，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: An agent powered by large language models have achieved impressive results,
but effectively handling the vast amounts of historical data generated during
interactions remains a challenge. The current approach is to design a memory
module for the agent to process these data. However, existing methods, such as
MemoryBank and A-MEM, have poor quality of stored memory content, which affects
recall performance and response quality. In order to better construct
high-quality long-term memory content, we have designed a multiple memory
system (MMS) inspired by cognitive psychology theory. The system processes
short-term memory to multiple long-term memory fragments, and constructs
retrieval memory units and contextual memory units based on these fragments,
with a one-to-one correspondence between the two. During the retrieval phase,
MMS will match the most relevant retrieval memory units based on the user's
query. Then, the corresponding contextual memory units is obtained as the
context for the response stage to enhance knowledge, thereby effectively
utilizing historical data. Experiments on LoCoMo dataset compared our method
with three others, proving its effectiveness. Ablation studies confirmed the
rationality of our memory units. We also analyzed the robustness regarding the
number of selected memory segments and the storage overhead, demonstrating its
practical value.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于记忆机制的LLM智能体主要依赖单粒度记忆，受限于经验收集质量，限制了知识多样性和规划灵活性

Method: 将环境信息转化为粗粒度关注点指导经验收集，然后从每个经验中提取可操作的混合粒度提示。在推理时检索任务相关经验和提示，遇到异常时通过细粒度关键信息进行自我问答反思和计划修正

Result: 该框架能够充分利用记忆进行灵活的场景适应，提升LLM智能体在复杂规划任务中的表现

Conclusion: Coarse-to-Fine Grounded Memory框架通过多粒度记忆机制有效解决了现有单粒度记忆的局限性，为LLM智能体提供了更强大的规划能力

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have driven growing
interest in LLM-based agents for complex planning tasks. To avoid costly agent
training, many studies adopted memory mechanism that enhances LLM with offline
experiences or online trajectory analysis. However, existing works focus on
single-granularity memory derived from dynamic environmental interactions,
which are inherently constrained by the quality of the collected experiences.
This limitation, in turn, constrain the diversity of knowledge and the
flexibility of planning. We propose Coarse-to-Fine Grounded Memory (\Ours{}), a
novel framework that grounds coarse-to-fine memories with LLM, thereby fully
leverage them for flexible adaptation to diverse scenarios. \Ours{} grounds
environmental information into coarse-grained focus points to guide experience
collection in training tasks, followed by grounding of actionable
hybrid-grained tips from each experience. At inference, \Ours{} retrieves
task-relevant experiences and tips to support planning. When facing
environmental anomalies, the LLM grounds the current situation into
fine-grained key information, enabling flexible self-QA reflection and plan
correction.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SPW方法通过搜索专家演示中的相似状态-动作对来为偏好标记轨迹中的每个转移分配重要性权重，从而统一专家演示和人类偏好两种反馈源，解决了离线强化学习中的信用分配问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 离线强化学习通常依赖精心设计的奖励函数，但这类函数设计困难且成本高昂。人类反馈是替代方案，但专家演示和偏好这两种形式各有局限：演示成本高且行为模式有限，偏好易于收集但信用分配不明确。

Method: 提出搜索式偏好加权(SPW)方案：对于偏好标记轨迹中的每个转移，搜索专家演示中最相似的状态-动作对，基于相似度得分直接推导逐步重要性权重，然后用这些权重指导标准偏好学习。

Result: SPW能够有效结合偏好和演示进行联合学习，在具有挑战性的机器人操作任务上优于之前利用两种反馈类型的方法。

Conclusion: SPW方案成功解决了人类反馈中的信用分配问题，为离线强化学习提供了一种更有效的多源反馈融合方法。

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning refers to the process of learning policies
from fixed datasets, without requiring additional environment interaction.
However, it often relies on well-defined reward functions, which are difficult
and expensive to design. Human feedback is an appealing alternative, but its
two common forms, expert demonstrations and preferences, have complementary
limitations. Demonstrations provide stepwise supervision, but they are costly
to collect and often reflect limited expert behavior modes. In contrast,
preferences are easier to collect, but it is unclear which parts of a behavior
contribute most to a trajectory segment, leaving credit assignment unresolved.
In this paper, we introduce a Search-Based Preference Weighting (SPW) scheme to
unify these two feedback sources. For each transition in a preference labeled
trajectory, SPW searches for the most similar state-action pairs from expert
demonstrations and directly derives stepwise importance weights based on their
similarity scores. These weights are then used to guide standard preference
learning, enabling more accurate credit assignment that traditional approaches
struggle to achieve. We demonstrate that SPW enables effective joint learning
from preferences and demonstrations, outperforming prior methods that leverage
both feedback types on challenging robot manipulation tasks.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了RETAIL数据集和TGMA多智能体框架，解决现有旅行规划系统在隐式查询、环境因素和详细规划方面的不足，显著提升了真实场景下的旅行规划性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前语言模型在旅行规划中存在三个主要问题：1）假设用户提供显式查询，而现实中需求往往是隐式的；2）忽略环境因素和用户偏好，限制计划可行性；3）只能生成基本POI安排，无法提供包含丰富细节的一体化计划。

Method: 构建了RETAIL数据集支持隐式和显式查询的决策，包含修订需求，具备环境感知能力确保现实可行性，并提供详细的POI信息。提出了主题引导的多智能体框架TGMA。

Result: 实验显示现有最强模型仅达到1.0%的通过率，表明真实世界旅行规划极具挑战性。相比之下，TGMA框架实现了2.72%的性能提升，展现出显著改进。

Conclusion: TGMA框架为真实世界旅行规划提供了有前景的方向，通过多智能体方法和综合数据集解决了现有系统的关键局限性。

Abstract: Although large language models have enhanced automated travel planning
abilities, current systems remain misaligned with real-world scenarios. First,
they assume users provide explicit queries, while in reality requirements are
often implicit. Second, existing solutions ignore diverse environmental factors
and user preferences, limiting the feasibility of plans. Third, systems can
only generate plans with basic POI arrangements, failing to provide all-in-one
plans with rich details. To mitigate these challenges, we construct a novel
dataset \textbf{RETAIL}, which supports decision-making for implicit queries
while covering explicit queries, both with and without revision needs. It also
enables environmental awareness to ensure plan feasibility under real-world
scenarios, while incorporating detailed POI information for all-in-one travel
plans. Furthermore, we propose a topic-guided multi-agent framework, termed
TGMA. Our experiments reveal that even the strongest existing model achieves
merely a 1.0% pass rate, indicating real-world travel planning remains
extremely challenging. In contrast, TGMA demonstrates substantially improved
performance 2.72%, offering promising directions for real-world travel
planning.

Motivation: 现有自动化心电图分析方法在跨临床任务泛化能力和开放式推理方面存在局限，需要一种能够统一处理心电图信号和自然语言的集成框架。

Method: 使用导联无关编码器和量化模块将连续ECG嵌入离散化为符号标记，扩展LLM词汇表；通过自回归ECG预测任务进行预训练，最后在ECG问答和诊断报告生成任务上进行指令微调。

Result: DiagECG在不修改核心模型的情况下，在多个任务上取得了强劲性能，并保持了在分布外设置下的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该研究展示了将符号化ECG表示整合到LLMs中进行医学推理的潜力，为心血管诊断提供了新的自动化解决方案。

Abstract: Electrocardiography plays a central role in cardiovascular diagnostics, yet
existing automated approaches often struggle to generalize across clinical
tasks and offer limited support for open-ended reasoning. We present DiagECG, a
novel framework that integrates time-series and language modeling by enabling
large language models to process 12-lead ECG signals for clinical text
generation tasks. Our approach discretizes continuous ECG embeddings into
symbolic tokens using a lead-independent encoder and quantization module. These
tokens are then used to extend the vocabulary of LLM, allowing the model to
handle both ECG and natural language inputs in a unified manner. To bridge the
modality gap, we pretrain the model on an autoregressive ECG forecasting task,
enabling the LLM to model temporal dynamics using its native language modeling
capabilities. Finally, we perform instruction tuning on both ECG question
answering and diagnostic report generation. Without modifying the core model,
DiagECG achieves strong performance across tasks while maintaining
generalization to out-of-distribution settings. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of each component and highlight the potential of
integrating symbolic ECG representations into LLMs for medical reasoning.

Abstract: In many planning applications, we might be interested in finding plans that
minimally modify the initial state to achieve the goals. We refer to this
concept as plan disruption. In this paper, we formally introduce it, and define

Abstract: The advancement of large language models (LLMs) is critically dependent on
the availability of high-quality datasets for Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT),
alignment tasks like Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), etc. In this work,
we present a comprehensive synthetic data generation framework that facilitates
scalable, configurable, and high-fidelity generation of synthetic data tailored
for these training paradigms. Our approach employs a modular and
configuration-based pipeline capable of modeling complex dialogue flows with
minimal manual intervention. This framework uses a dual-stage quality tagging
mechanism, combining heuristic rules and LLM-based evaluations, to
automatically filter and score data extracted from OASST-formatted
conversations, ensuring the curation of high-quality dialogue samples. The
resulting datasets are structured under a flexible schema supporting both SFT

Motivation: 现有LLM的思维链推理在处理复杂逻辑任务时表现良好，但过长的推理链会导致计算浪费和响应变慢，需要动态调整推理深度。

Method: 建立块结构范式：预测推理预算（块数），然后分区推理；通过三阶段训练（SFT、DPO、RL）训练自适应模型；在推理时利用显式块数动态控制推理深度。

Result: 该方法能够根据问题难度自适应调整推理深度，实现从零推理到深度推理的灵活调节。

Conclusion: Think in Blocks框架为LLM提供了动态调整推理长度的有效方法，提高了推理效率并减少了计算浪费。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) with chains-of-thought have demonstrated strong
performance on an increasing range of tasks, particularly those involving
complex logical reasoning. However, excessively long chains can lead to
overthinking, causing computational waste and slower responses. This raises a
question: can LLMs dynamically adjust the length of their reasoning processes
based on task complexity? To address this, we propose the Think in Blocks
framework, which enables adaptive reasoning-from zero to deep reasoning-by
partitioning the reasoning process into a tunable number of blocks. Our main
contributions are: (1) Establishing an explicit block-structured paradigm in
which the model first predicts an integer reasoning budget-the number of
blocks-and then partitions its reasoning accordingly; (2) Training an adaptive
model through a three-stage pipeline-Supervised Fine-Tuning, reward-guided
Direct Preference Optimization, and Reinforcement Learning-that adjusts its
reasoning depth to problem difficulty; (3) Exploiting the explicit block count
to dynamically control reasoning depth at inference time, allowing flexible
adjustment of chain-of-thought length during deployment.

TL;DR: 本研究通过虚拟锦标赛实验发现，语言模型代理在团队内部重复互动和团队间竞争的双重作用下，合作水平显著提升，包括一次性互动中的合作倾向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着自主人工智能代理的发展，研究其合作行为倾向变得日益重要。研究受到超加性合作理论的启发，该理论认为重复互动和群体间竞争的结合是人类合作倾向的原因。

Method: 设计虚拟锦标赛，将语言模型代理分组进行囚徒困境博弈，同时模拟团队内部动态和外部竞争环境。

Result: 研究发现内部团队动态和外部竞争的结合显著提高了整体合作水平和一次性互动中的合作倾向。

Conclusion: 研究为语言模型在复杂社会场景中制定策略提供了新框架，证明群体间竞争可以反直觉地导致更多合作行为，这对设计未来多智能体AI系统具有重要意义。

Abstract: With the prospect of autonomous artificial intelligence (AI) agents, studying
their tendency for cooperative behavior becomes an increasingly relevant topic.
This study is inspired by the super-additive cooperation theory, where the
combined effects of repeated interactions and inter-group rivalry have been
argued to be the cause for cooperative tendencies found in humans. We devised a
virtual tournament where language model agents, grouped into teams, face each
other in a Prisoner's Dilemma game. By simulating both internal team dynamics
and external competition, we discovered that this blend substantially boosts
both overall and initial, one-shot cooperation levels (the tendency to
cooperate in one-off interactions). This research provides a novel framework
for large language models to strategize and act in complex social scenarios and
offers evidence for how intergroup competition can, counter-intuitively, result
in more cooperative behavior. These insights are crucial for designing future
multi-agent AI systems that can effectively work together and better align with
human values. Source code is available at

TL;DR: DeepThink3D通过组合迭代进化方法生成更复杂的3D场景推理问题，并使用DPO直接优化大语言模型的工具链策略，提升其在复杂3D推理任务中的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在3D场景推理任务中通过大语言模型调用工具，但由于数据集问题简单，生成的程序推理链较短，难以处理复杂推理任务。

Method: 提出组合迭代进化方法在SQA3D基准上生成更复杂问题，并通过直接偏好优化(DPO)微调大语言模型，优化工具链策略。

Result: 增强了大型语言模型在复杂3D场景推理中使用工具的能力，提高了复杂任务的准确性。

Conclusion: DeepThink3D方法有效解决了3D场景复杂推理的挑战，通过问题复杂化和策略优化显著提升了模型性能。

Abstract: This work enhances the ability of large language models (LLMs) to perform
complex reasoning in 3D scenes. Recent work has addressed the 3D situated
reasoning task by invoking tool usage through large language models. Large
language models call tools via APIs and integrate the generated programs
through a chain of thought to solve problems based on the program results.
However, due to the simplicity of the questions in the dataset, the generated
program reasoning chains are relatively short. To solve this main challenge, in
this paper, we introduce DeepThink3D to enhance the tool usage of LLMs in
complex 3D situated reasoning tasks. Our work proposes a combinatorial and
iterative evolutionary approach on the SQA3D benchmark to generate more complex
questions. Building on this foundation, we fine-tune the large language model
to make it more proficient in using 3D tools. By employing Direct Preference
Optimization (DPO), we directly optimize the toolchain strategies generated by
models, thereby enhancing their accuracy in complex tasks.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出基于动力系统理论和有限时间李雅普诺夫指数的框架，用于形式化验证强化学习策略的安全性和鲁棒性，通过识别拉格朗日相干结构来揭示系统的隐藏行为模式和安全边界。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 强化学习在安全关键系统中的应用受到缺乏形式化验证方法的限制，需要一种能够分析策略鲁棒性和安全性的系统化框架。

Method: 将RL智能体与环境组合视为离散时间自治动力系统，利用有限时间李雅普诺夫指数识别拉格朗日相干结构，并引入MBR、ASAS、TASAS等量化指标来测量策略的安全裕度和鲁棒性。

Result: 在离散和连续控制环境中验证了框架的有效性，成功识别出仅基于奖励看似成功但存在关键缺陷的策略，提供了可解释的策略行为评估。

Conclusion: 该框架为强化学习策略提供了全面且可解释的安全性和鲁棒性评估方法，能够发现隐藏的安全风险和收敛特性，为安全关键应用提供了重要工具。

Abstract: The application of reinforcement learning to safety-critical systems is
limited by the lack of formal methods for verifying the robustness and safety
of learned policies. This paper introduces a novel framework that addresses
this gap by analyzing the combination of an RL agent and its environment as a
discrete-time autonomous dynamical system. By leveraging tools from dynamical
systems theory, specifically the Finite-Time Lyapunov Exponent (FTLE), we
identify and visualize Lagrangian Coherent Structures (LCS) that act as the
hidden "skeleton" governing the system's behavior. We demonstrate that
repelling LCS function as safety barriers around unsafe regions, while
attracting LCS reveal the system's convergence properties and potential failure
modes, such as unintended "trap" states. To move beyond qualitative
visualization, we introduce a suite of quantitative metrics, Mean Boundary
Repulsion (MBR), Aggregated Spurious Attractor Strength (ASAS), and
Temporally-Aware Spurious Attractor Strength (TASAS), to formally measure a
policy's safety margin and robustness. We further provide a method for deriving
local stability guarantees and extend the analysis to handle model uncertainty.
Through experiments in both discrete and continuous control environments, we
show that this framework provides a comprehensive and interpretable assessment
of policy behavior, successfully identifying critical flaws in policies that
appear successful based on reward alone.

TL;DR: Agentics是一个模块化框架，用于构建基于代理的系统，支持结构化推理和组合泛化，通过数据建模而非提示工程来实现声明式AI工作流。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统AI开发需要大量手工编写提示，难以实现复杂数据的结构化推理和组合泛化。Agentics旨在让开发者专注于数据建模而非提示工程。

Method: 将代理从逻辑流中抽象出来，在数据类型内部使用代理实现逻辑转换，通过LLM提供数据类型并通过逻辑转换进行组合。

Result: 在领域特定多选题回答、文本到SQL的语义解析和自动提示优化任务中达到最先进准确率或改进可扩展性而不牺牲性能。

Conclusion: Agentics框架为AI开发提供了新的数据建模视角，通过声明式语言和逻辑转换实现了更高效和可扩展的代理系统构建。

Abstract: This paper introduces Agentics, a modular framework for building agent-based
systems capable of structured reasoning and compositional generalization over
complex data. Designed with research and practical applications in mind,
Agentics offers a novel perspective on working with data and AI workflows. In
this framework, agents are abstracted from the logical flow and they are used
internally to the data type to enable logical transduction among data. Agentics
encourages AI developers to focus on modeling data rather than crafting
prompts, enabling a declarative language in which data types are provided by
LLMs and composed through logical transduction, which is executed by LLMs when
types are connected. We provide empirical evidence demonstrating the
applicability of this framework across domain-specific multiple-choice question
answering, semantic parsing for text-to-SQL, and automated prompt optimization
tasks, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy or improved scalability without
sacrificing performance. The open-source implementation is available at
\texttt{https://github.com/IBM/agentics}.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HDM是ACT-R声明性记忆系统的向量符号替代方案，具有可扩展性和架构定义的相似性优势，已成功适配到Lisp ACT-R，使现有模型无需重大修改即可运行。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为ACT-R的声明性记忆系统提供更可扩展的向量符号替代方案，同时保持与现有模型的兼容性。

Method: 开发基于向量的ACT-R函数版本，建立文本处理管道将大型文档内容添加到记忆库，创建基于向量表示检索完整记忆块的机制。

Result: 初步结果表明HDM保持了向量符号优势（如无需存储实际块即可回忆），同时使先前ACT-R模型只需极少修改即可工作。

Conclusion: HDM成功移植到ACT-R系统，未来将探索更好的时间上下文表示和改进块重构能力，并开发基于实例学习的决策模型来全面测试系统。

Abstract: Holographic Declarative Memory (HDM) is a vector-symbolic alternative to
ACT-R's Declarative Memory (DM) system that can bring advantages such as
scalability and architecturally defined similarity between DM chunks. We
adapted HDM to work with the most comprehensive and widely-used implementation
of ACT-R (Lisp ACT-R) so extant ACT-R models designed with DM can be run with
HDM without major changes. With this adaptation of HDM, we have developed
vector-based versions of common ACT-R functions, set up a text processing
pipeline to add the contents of large documents to ACT-R memory, and most
significantly created a useful and novel mechanism to retrieve an entire chunk
of memory based on a request using only vector representations of tokens.
Preliminary results indicate that we can maintain vector-symbolic advantages of
HDM (e.g., chunk recall without storing the actual chunk and other advantages
with scaling) while also extending it so that previous ACT-R models may work
with the system with little (or potentially no) modifications within the actual
procedural and declarative memory portions of a model. As a part of iterative
improvement of this newly translated holographic declarative memory module, we
will continue to explore better time-context representations for vectors to
improve the module's ability to reconstruct chunks during recall. To more fully
test this translated HDM module, we also plan to develop decision-making models
that use instance-based learning (IBL) theory, which is a useful application of
HDM given the advantages of the system.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了基于信息论Shapley值的Intended Cooperation Values (ICVs)方法，通过分析策略分布来量化多智能体强化学习中个体智能体的因果影响力，无需价值函数反馈即可评估智能体行为贡献。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常依赖显式奖励信号或学习价值函数来评估团队整体性能，但在缺乏价值反馈时难以推断个体智能体的贡献。需要一种仅通过策略分布分析就能获得有意义见解的方法。

Method: 受智能体追求收敛工具价值现象启发，引入ICVs方法，基于信息论Shapley值量化每个智能体对同伴工具赋能的因果影响。通过评估决策不确定性和偏好对齐来测量智能体动作对队友策略的影响。

Result: 在合作性和竞争性MARL环境中的分析揭示了智能体采用相似或多样化策略的程度。通过比较策略和价值函数之间的动作效果，识别出哪些智能体行为通过促进确定性决策或保持未来行动灵活性来有益于团队成功。

Conclusion: ICVs方法为合作动态提供了新颖见解，增强了MARL系统的可解释性，能够在没有价值反馈的情况下可靠地理解个体智能体行为。

Abstract: To reliably deploy Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) systems, it is
crucial to understand individual agent behaviors within a team. While prior
work typically evaluates overall team performance based on explicit reward
signals or learned value functions, it is unclear how to infer agent
contributions in the absence of any value feedback. In this work, we
investigate whether meaningful insights into agent behaviors can be extracted
that are consistent with the underlying value functions, solely by analyzing
the policy distribution. Inspired by the phenomenon that intelligent agents
tend to pursue convergent instrumental values, which generally increase the
likelihood of task success, we introduce Intended Cooperation Values (ICVs), a
method based on information-theoretic Shapley values for quantifying each
agent's causal influence on their co-players' instrumental empowerment.
Specifically, ICVs measure an agent's action effect on its teammates' policies
by assessing their decision uncertainty and preference alignment. The analysis
across cooperative and competitive MARL environments reveals the extent to
which agents adopt similar or diverse strategies. By comparing action effects
between policies and value functions, our method identifies which agent
behaviors are beneficial to team success, either by fostering deterministic
decisions or by preserving flexibility for future action choices. Our proposed
method offers novel insights into cooperation dynamics and enhances
explainability in MARL systems.

TL;DR: 本文通过技术哲学视角分析欧盟AI法案，揭示了AI系统中数据的递归价值链动态，提出了基于Simondon哲学的形式化AI生命周期模型，强调需要针对基础设施和时间动态的监管措施。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI监管框架未能充分处理从数据摄入到部署的完整生命周期中产生的递归价值链，特别是技术操作和经济逻辑背后的"生成动态"，这导致了监管盲点和权力不对称。

Method: 采用跨学科方法，结合技术分析和哲学理论，引入Simondon的技术哲学概念（特别是个体化理论），建立AI生命周期的形式化模型，包括前个体环境、个体化和个体化AI三个阶段。

Result: 提出了"未来性"概念来描述AI自我强化的生命周期，揭示了数据的递归生成性和非竞争性特征，识别了基础设施（如特征存储）在价值集中和决策权力不对称中的关键作用。

Conclusion: 有效的AI监管必须解决基础设施和时间动态问题，建议实施生命周期审计、时间可追溯性、反馈问责、递归透明度以及反对递归重用的权利等措施。

Abstract: This paper argues that a techno-philosophical reading of the EU AI Act
provides insight into the long-term dynamics of data in AI systems,
specifically, how the lifecycle from ingestion to deployment generates
recursive value chains that challenge existing frameworks for Responsible AI.
We introduce a conceptual tool to frame the AI pipeline, spanning data,
training regimes, architectures, feature stores, and transfer learning. Using
cross-disciplinary methods, we develop a technically grounded and
philosophically coherent analysis of regulatory blind spots. Our central claim
is that what remains absent from policymaking is an account of the dynamic of
becoming that underpins both the technical operation and economic logic of AI.
To address this, we advance a formal reading of AI inspired by Simondonian
philosophy of technology, reworking his concept of individuation to model the
AI lifecycle, including the pre-individual milieu, individuation, and
individuated AI. To translate these ideas, we introduce futurity: the
self-reinforcing lifecycle of AI, where more data enhances performance, deepens
personalisation, and expands application domains. Futurity highlights the
recursively generative, non-rivalrous nature of data, underpinned by
infrastructures like feature stores that enable feedback, adaptation, and
temporal recursion. Our intervention foregrounds escalating power asymmetries,
particularly the tech oligarchy whose infrastructures of capture, training, and
deployment concentrate value and decision-making. We argue that effective
regulation must address these infrastructural and temporal dynamics, and
propose measures including lifecycle audits, temporal traceability, feedback
accountability, recursion transparency, and a right to contest recursive reuse.

Motivation: 人工智能的软件服务在应用通用性上带来了变革性影响，但作为用户采纳加速的同时，需要理解并减缓AI服务对环境的影响。目前没有研究在生产环境中测量AI服务环境指标，这篇论文就是为了补充这一空白。

Method: 论文提出并执行了一种综合方法来测量AI推理工作负荷的能量使用、碳排放和水消耗。这种方法考虑了AI服务基础设施的全栈，包括活跃的AI加速器功耗、主机系统能量、空闲机器容量和数据中心能量过费。通过对Google的AI基础设施进行详细的仪器测量，以服务Gemini AI助手。

Abstract: The transformative power of AI is undeniable - but as user adoption
accelerates, so does the need to understand and mitigate the environmental
impact of AI serving. However, no studies have measured AI serving
environmental metrics in a production environment. This paper addresses this
gap by proposing and executing a comprehensive methodology for measuring the
energy usage, carbon emissions, and water consumption of AI inference workloads
in a large-scale, AI production environment. Our approach accounts for the full
stack of AI serving infrastructure - including active AI accelerator power,
host system energy, idle machine capacity, and data center energy overhead.
Through detailed instrumentation of Google's AI infrastructure for serving the
Gemini AI assistant, we find the median Gemini Apps text prompt consumes 0.24
Wh of energy - a figure substantially lower than many public estimates. We also
show that Google's software efficiency efforts and clean energy procurement
have driven a 33x reduction in energy consumption and a 44x reduction in carbon
footprint for the median Gemini Apps text prompt over one year. We identify
that the median Gemini Apps text prompt uses less energy than watching nine
seconds of television (0.24 Wh) and consumes the equivalent of five drops of
water (0.26 mL). While these impacts are low compared to other daily
activities, reducing the environmental impact of AI serving continues to
warrant important attention. Towards this objective, we propose that a
comprehensive measurement of AI serving environmental metrics is critical for
accurately comparing models, and to properly incentivize efficiency gains
across the full AI serving stack.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 与AI代理形成偏社交关系对人类健康有严重危害，但防止这种动态面临挑战，因为偏社交线索通常在私密对话中渐进形成，而且不是所有情感参与都有害。

Method: 重新利用最先进的语言模型构建了一个简单的响应评估框架，能够实时评估进行中的对话中的偏社交线索。使用30个涵盖偏社交、奇巧和中性对话的综合数据集进行测试。

Result: 通过五阶段迭代评估，在宽容一致性规则下成功识别所有偏社交对话，同时避免了误报，检测通常在对话的前几轮交流中完成。

Conclusion: 评估代理可以为防止偏社交关系提供一种可行的解决方案，这些发现为该方法提供了初步证据。

Abstract: The development of parasocial relationships with AI agents has severe, and in
some cases, tragic effects for human well-being. Yet preventing such dynamics
is challenging: parasocial cues often emerge gradually in private
conversations, and not all forms of emotional engagement are inherently
harmful. We address this challenge by introducing a simple response evaluation
framework, created by repurposing a state-of-the-art language model, that
evaluates ongoing conversations for parasocial cues in real time. To test the
feasibility of this approach, we constructed a small synthetic dataset of
thirty dialogues spanning parasocial, sycophantic, and neutral conversations.
Iterative evaluation with five stage testing successfully identified all
parasocial conversations while avoiding false positives under a tolerant
unanimity rule, with detection typically occurring within the first few
exchanges. These findings provide preliminary evidence that evaluation agents
can provide a viable solution for the prevention of parasocial relations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统配置优化方法存在维度独立处理、缺乏可解释性，而自动化方法缺乏动态适应性和语义推理能力，需要一种能够理解训练动态和配置依赖关系的智能优化框架。

Method: 采用多智能体LLM架构：Advisor提出配置变更建议，Evaluator评估进展，Optimizer优化决策过程，形成自改进反馈循环，并引入文本梯度提供语义理解。

Result: 在六个不同数据集上的综合评估显示，LGT相比传统优化方法有显著改进，在保持高可解释性的同时实现了性能提升。

Conclusion: LGT框架通过语言引导的智能优化，有效解决了机器学习配置优化的关键瓶颈，提供了具有语义理解和动态适应能力的优化解决方案。

Abstract: Configuration optimization remains a critical bottleneck in machine learning,
requiring coordinated tuning across model architecture, training strategy,
feature engineering, and hyperparameters. Traditional approaches treat these
dimensions independently and lack interpretability, while recent automated
methods struggle with dynamic adaptability and semantic reasoning about
optimization decisions. We introduce Language-Guided Tuning (LGT), a novel
framework that employs multi-agent Large Language Models to intelligently
optimize configurations through natural language reasoning. We apply textual
gradients - qualitative feedback signals that complement numerical optimization
by providing semantic understanding of training dynamics and configuration
interdependencies. LGT coordinates three specialized agents: an Advisor that
proposes configuration changes, an Evaluator that assesses progress, and an
Optimizer that refines the decision-making process, creating a self-improving
feedback loop. Through comprehensive evaluation on six diverse datasets, LGT
demonstrates substantial improvements over traditional optimization methods,
achieving performance gains while maintaining high interpretability.
