TL;DR: 本文提出了两种无需真实训练数据的水下3D目标检测方法：基于物理的声纳模拟训练神经网络和基于模板匹配的几何方法，发现在真实数据上模板匹配方法（83% mAP）比神经网络（40% mAP）更具鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决水下3D目标检测中真实标注数据获取困难且成本高昂的问题，探索无需真实训练数据的可靠检测方法。

Method: 开发了两种范式：1）基于物理的声纳模拟管道生成合成训练数据用于神经网络；2）基于模型的模板匹配系统利用目标物体的几何先验。

Result: 神经网络在模拟场景达到98% mAP，但在真实声纳数据上降至40% mAP；模板匹配方法在真实数据上保持83% mAP且无需训练。

Conclusion: 模板匹配方法在水下环境中比数据饥渴的深度学习方法更具鲁棒性，为数据稀缺环境下的水下自主导航、海洋考古和基础设施监测开辟了新可能性。

Abstract: Underwater 3D object detection remains one of the most challenging frontiers
in computer vision, where traditional approaches struggle with the harsh
acoustic environment and scarcity of training data. While deep learning has
revolutionized terrestrial 3D detection, its application underwater faces a
critical bottleneck: obtaining sufficient annotated sonar data is prohibitively
expensive and logistically complex, often requiring specialized vessels, expert
surveyors, and favorable weather conditions. This work addresses a fundamental
question: Can we achieve reliable underwater 3D object detection without
real-world training data? We tackle this challenge by developing and comparing
two paradigms for training-free detection of artificial structures in multibeam
echo-sounder point clouds. Our dual approach combines a physics-based sonar
simulation pipeline that generates synthetic training data for state-of-the-art
neural networks, with a robust model-based template matching system that
leverages geometric priors of target objects. Evaluation on real bathymetry
surveys from the Baltic Sea reveals surprising insights: while neural networks
trained on synthetic data achieve 98% mean Average Precision (mAP) on simulated
scenes, they drop to 40% mAP on real sonar data due to domain shift.
Conversely, our template matching approach maintains 83% mAP on real data
without requiring any training, demonstrating remarkable robustness to acoustic
noise and environmental variations. Our findings challenge conventional wisdom
about data-hungry deep learning in underwater domains and establish the first
large-scale benchmark for training-free underwater 3D detection. This work
opens new possibilities for autonomous underwater vehicle navigation, marine
archaeology, and offshore infrastructure monitoring in data-scarce environments
where traditional machine learning approaches fail.

### [2] [MobileDenseAttn:A Dual-Stream Architecture for Accurate and Interpretable Brain Tumor Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18294)
*Shudipta Banik,Muna Das,Trapa Banik,Md. Ehsanul Haque*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 通过融合MobileNetV2和DenseNet201双流模型的MobileDenseAttn模型，在脑部肿瘤MRI检测中实现了98.35%的测试准确率，较基准模型提升3.67%准确率并减少39.3%训练时间，同时通过GradCAM提供可解释性的病变定位。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有脑部肿瘤MRI检测方法存在以下问题：对异质性肿瘤的泛化能力有限、计算效率低、可解释性差以及缺乏透明度，影响了模型的可信赖性。手动分析时间长且容易出错。

Method: 提出MobileDenseAttn模型，融合MobileNetV2和DenseNet201的双流模型结构，使用特征层融合技术。在6,020张增幅后的MRI扫描图像上训练，包含贝维肿、脑膜肿、脯体肿和正常样本。采用5折交叉验证协议，并通过GradCAM提供视觉解释。

Result: 模型在训练集上达到99.75%的准确率，测试集准确率为98.35%，F1分数为0.9835（95% CI: 0.9743-0.9920）。与基准模型（VGG19、DenseNet201、MobileNetV2）相比，准确率提高3.67%，训练时间减少39.3%。GradCAM热力图清晰显示肿瘤受影响区域。

Conclusion: MobileDenseAttn是一个高效、高性能、可解释的模型，在脑部肿瘤检测方面显示出显著的优势。其稳定性和临床可解释性使得它有很高可能成为真实世界中的临床实用工具。

Abstract: The detection of brain tumor in MRI is an important aspect of ensuring timely
diagnostics and treatment; however, manual analysis is commonly long and
error-prone. Current approaches are not universal because they have limited
generalization to heterogeneous tumors, are computationally inefficient, are
not interpretable, and lack transparency, thus limiting trustworthiness. To
overcome these issues, we introduce MobileDenseAttn, a fusion model of dual
streams of MobileNetV2 and DenseNet201 that can help gradually improve the
feature representation scale, computing efficiency, and visual explanations via
GradCAM. Our model uses feature level fusion and is trained on an augmented
dataset of 6,020 MRI scans representing glioma, meningioma, pituitary tumors,
and normal samples. Measured under strict 5-fold cross-validation protocols,
MobileDenseAttn provides a training accuracy of 99.75%, a testing accuracy of
98.35%, and a stable F1 score of 0.9835 (95% CI: 0.9743 to 0.9920). The
extensive validation shows the stability of the model, and the comparative
analysis proves that it is a great advancement over the baseline models (VGG19,
DenseNet201, MobileNetV2) with a +3.67% accuracy increase and a 39.3% decrease
in training time compared to VGG19. The GradCAM heatmaps clearly show
tumor-affected areas, offering clinically significant localization and
improving interpretability. These findings position MobileDenseAttn as an
efficient, high performance, interpretable model with a high probability of
becoming a clinically practical tool in identifying brain tumors in the real
world.

### [3] [Can VLMs Recall Factual Associations From Visual References?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18297)
*Dhananjay Ashok,Ashutosh Chaubey,Hirona J. Arai,Jonathan May,Jesse Thomason*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究发现视觉语言模型在多模态基础方面存在系统性缺陷，当实体以视觉而非文本形式呈现时，模型回忆事实知识的能力显著下降，图像表示使事实回忆能力减半。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 识别视觉语言模型在多模态基础中的系统性缺陷，特别是模型在视觉参考而非文本参考时回忆事实知识的能力差异。

Method: 通过对照研究分析VLMs的表现差异，使用内部状态模式探测来识别模型不可靠响应的情况，并在视觉问答任务中应用选择性预测。

Result: 图像表示使VLMs事实回忆能力降低50%，内部状态探测达到92%以上的准确率来标记不可靠响应，选择性预测使覆盖率提高7.87%同时降低错误风险0.9%。

Conclusion: VLMs在将内部实体知识与图像表示链接方面存在困难，这种系统性缺陷是可检测的，为解决语言基础问题提供了重要方向和改进建议。

Abstract: Through a controlled study, we identify a systematic deficiency in the
multimodal grounding of Vision Language Models (VLMs). While VLMs can recall
factual associations when provided a textual reference to an entity; their
ability to do so is significantly diminished when the reference is visual
instead. Forcing VLMs to rely on image representations of an entity halves
their ability to recall factual knowledge, suggesting that VLMs struggle to
link their internal knowledge of an entity with its image representation. We
show that such linking failures are correlated with the expression of distinct
patterns in model internal states, and that probes on these internal states
achieve over 92% accuracy at flagging cases where the VLM response is
unreliable. These probes can be applied, without retraining, to identify when a
VLM will fail to correctly answer a question that requires an understanding of
multimodal input. When used to facilitate selective prediction on a visual
question answering task, the probes increase coverage by 7.87% (absolute) while
also reducing the risk of error by 0.9% (absolute). Addressing the systematic,
detectable deficiency is an important avenue in language grounding, and we
provide informed recommendations for future directions.

### [4] [SERES: Semantic-aware neural reconstruction from sparse views](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18314)
*Bo Xu,Yuhu Guo,Yuchao Wang,Wenting Wang,Yeung Yam,Charlie C. L. Wang,Xinyi Le*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种语义感知的神经重建方法，从稀疏图像生成高保真3D模型，通过添加基于patch的语义logits来丰富神经隐式表示，并引入基于几何基元掩码的正则化来缓解形状模糊问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决稀疏输入中特征不匹配导致的严重辐射模糊问题，提高从稀疏图像进行3D重建的质量和准确性。

Method: 在神经隐式表示中添加patch-based语义logits，与有符号距离场和辐射场联合优化；引入基于几何基元掩码的新型正则化方法来缓解形状模糊。

Result: 在DTU数据集上，相比SparseNeuS重建的倒角距离平均减少44%，相比VolRecon减少20%；作为NeuS和Neuralangelo等密集重建基线的插件时，DTU数据集上的平均误差分别减少69%和68%。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了稀疏图像3D重建中的辐射模糊和形状模糊问题，显著提升了重建精度，可作为现有密集重建方法的有效补充插件。

Abstract: We propose a semantic-aware neural reconstruction method to generate 3D
high-fidelity models from sparse images. To tackle the challenge of severe
radiance ambiguity caused by mismatched features in sparse input, we enrich
neural implicit representations by adding patch-based semantic logits that are
optimized together with the signed distance field and the radiance field. A
novel regularization based on the geometric primitive masks is introduced to
mitigate shape ambiguity. The performance of our approach has been verified in
experimental evaluation. The average chamfer distances of our reconstruction on
the DTU dataset can be reduced by 44% for SparseNeuS and 20% for VolRecon. When
working as a plugin for those dense reconstruction baselines such as NeuS and
Neuralangelo, the average error on the DTU dataset can be reduced by 69% and
68% respectively.

### [5] [Automated Landfill Detection Using Deep Learning: A Comparative Study of Lightweight and Custom Architectures with the AerialWaste Dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18315)
*Nowshin Sharmily,Rusab Sarmun,Muhammad E. H. Chowdhury,Mir Hamidul Hussain,Saad Bin Abul Kashem,Molla E Majid,Amith Khandakar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 使用轻量级深度学习模型和集成方法在AerialWaste数据集上实现非法垃圾填埋场检测，达到92%以上的准确率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 非法垃圾填埋场对全球构成严重威胁，但人工识别困难且缺乏高质量公开数据集。AerialWaste数据集提供了解决这一问题的机会

Method: 采用Mobilenetv2、Googlenet、Densenet、MobileVit等轻量级深度学习模型，避免过拟合，并通过集成融合技术结合最佳模型

Result: 集成模型在二进制分类任务中取得92.33%准确率、92.67%精确率、92.33%敏感度、92.41% F1分数和92.71%特异性

Conclusion: 轻量级模型结合集成方法能有效识别非法垃圾填埋场，为环境保护提供可行的自动化解决方案

Abstract: Illegal landfills are posing as a hazardous threat to people all over the
world. Due to the arduous nature of manually identifying the location of
landfill, many landfills go unnoticed by authorities and later cause dangerous
harm to people and environment. Deep learning can play a significant role in
identifying these landfills while saving valuable time, manpower and resources.
Despite being a burning concern, good quality publicly released datasets for
illegal landfill detection are hard to find due to security concerns. However,
AerialWaste Dataset is a large collection of 10434 images of Lombardy region of
Italy. The images are of varying qualities, collected from three different
sources: AGEA Orthophotos, WorldView-3, and Google Earth. The dataset contains
professionally curated, diverse and high-quality images which makes it
particularly suitable for scalable and impactful research. As we trained
several models to compare results, we found complex and heavy models to be
prone to overfitting and memorizing training data instead of learning patterns.
Therefore, we chose lightweight simpler models which could leverage general
features from the dataset. In this study, Mobilenetv2, Googlenet, Densenet,
MobileVit and other lightweight deep learning models were used to train and
validate the dataset as they achieved significant success with less
overfitting. As we saw substantial improvement in the performance using some of
these models, we combined the best performing models and came up with an
ensemble model. With the help of ensemble and fusion technique, binary
classification could be performed on this dataset with 92.33% accuracy, 92.67%
precision, 92.33% sensitivity, 92.41% F1 score and 92.71% specificity.

### [6] [Structures Meet Semantics: Multimodal Fusion via Graph Contrastive Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18322)
*Jiangfeng Sun,Sihao He,Zhonghong Ou,Meina Song*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SSU是一个新颖的多模态情感分析框架，通过整合模态特定的结构信息和跨模态语义对齐，显著提升了多模态表示的质量和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态融合方法往往忽视模态特定的结构依赖和语义错位问题，限制了模型的质量、可解释性和鲁棒性。

Method: 提出Structural-Semantic Unifier (SSU)框架：1) 动态构建模态特定图（文本使用语言句法，声学和视觉使用轻量级文本引导注意力机制）；2) 引入基于全局文本语义的语义锚点作为跨模态对齐中心；3) 开发多视图对比学习目标来提升判别性和语义一致性。

Result: 在CMU-MOSI和CMU-MOSEI基准数据集上持续实现最先进性能，同时显著降低了计算开销。定性分析验证了模型的可解释性和捕捉细微情感模式的能力。

Conclusion: SSU框架通过系统整合结构信息和语义对齐，有效解决了多模态情感分析中的关键挑战，在性能和效率方面都表现出色。

Abstract: Multimodal sentiment analysis (MSA) aims to infer emotional states by
effectively integrating textual, acoustic, and visual modalities. Despite
notable progress, existing multimodal fusion methods often neglect
modality-specific structural dependencies and semantic misalignment, limiting
their quality, interpretability, and robustness. To address these challenges,
we propose a novel framework called the Structural-Semantic Unifier (SSU),
which systematically integrates modality-specific structural information and
cross-modal semantic grounding for enhanced multimodal representations.
Specifically, SSU dynamically constructs modality-specific graphs by leveraging
linguistic syntax for text and a lightweight, text-guided attention mechanism
for acoustic and visual modalities, thus capturing detailed intra-modal
relationships and semantic interactions. We further introduce a semantic
anchor, derived from global textual semantics, that serves as a cross-modal
alignment hub, effectively harmonizing heterogeneous semantic spaces across
modalities. Additionally, we develop a multiview contrastive learning objective
that promotes discriminability, semantic consistency, and structural coherence
across intra- and inter-modal views. Extensive evaluations on two widely used
benchmark datasets, CMU-MOSI and CMU-MOSEI, demonstrate that SSU consistently
achieves state-of-the-art performance while significantly reducing
computational overhead compared to prior methods. Comprehensive qualitative
analyses further validate SSU's interpretability and its ability to capture
nuanced emotional patterns through semantically grounded interactions.

### [7] [FastAvatar: Instant 3D Gaussian Splatting for Faces from Single Unconstrained Poses](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18389)
*Hao Liang,Zhixuan Ge,Ashish Tiwari,Soumendu Majee,G. M. Dilshan Godaliyadda,Ashok Veeraraghavan,Guha Balakrishnan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FastAvatar是一个基于3D高斯泼溅的快速单图像人脸重建框架，能够在<10ms内从任意姿态的单张人脸图像生成高质量的3DGS模型，比优化方法快1000倍


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的人脸3DGS方法要么需要耗时的逐脸优化，要么在重建质量和速度之间存在权衡。需要一种既能保持高质量重建又能实现实时推理的解决方案

Method: 使用编码器-解码器神经网络设计，首先构建3DGS人脸模板模型，然后编码输入图像为身份特定且姿态不变的潜在嵌入，解码预测模板高斯参数残差

Result: 在重建质量上显著优于现有前馈方法（如GAGAvatar），运行速度比逐脸优化方法快1000倍，支持实时身份插值和属性编辑

Conclusion: FastAvatar通过结合优秀重建质量和极快速度，扩展了3DGS在消费级和交互式系统中光真实感头像应用的范围

Abstract: We present FastAvatar, a pose-invariant, feed-forward framework that can
generate a 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) model from a single face image from an
arbitrary pose in near-instant time (<10ms). FastAvatar uses a novel
encoder-decoder neural network design to achieve both fast fitting and identity
preservation regardless of input pose. First, FastAvatar constructs a 3DGS face
``template'' model from a training dataset of faces with multi-view captures.
Second, FastAvatar encodes the input face image into an identity-specific and
pose-invariant latent embedding, and decodes this embedding to predict
residuals to the structural and appearance parameters of each Gaussian in the
template 3DGS model. By only inferring residuals in a feed-forward fashion,
model inference is fast and robust. FastAvatar significantly outperforms
existing feed-forward face 3DGS methods (e.g., GAGAvatar) in reconstruction
quality, and runs 1000x faster than per-face optimization methods (e.g.,
FlashAvatar, GaussianAvatars and GASP). In addition, FastAvatar's novel latent
space design supports real-time identity interpolation and attribute editing
which is not possible with any existing feed-forward 3DGS face generation
framework. FastAvatar's combination of excellent reconstruction quality and
speed expands the scope of 3DGS for photorealistic avatar applications in
consumer and interactive systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 开发了一个适用于人道主义紧急场景的移动生物识别系统，采用PolyProtect生物特征模板保护方案，在人脸和指纹识别中验证了其有效性、安全性和隐私保护能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在紧急人道主义场景中使用生物识别技术可以提高效率，但会加剧弱势群体的数据隐私风险，需要开发既能保护隐私又保持高效的系统。

Method: 通过制定功能性、操作性和安全隐私需求，比较分析生物特征模板保护方案，选择PolyProtect方法应用于神经网络人脸嵌入，并使用EdgeFace特征提取器在真实数据集上进行评估。

Result: 实验结果表明PolyProtect在验证和识别准确性、不可逆性和不可链接性方面表现良好，首次在指纹生物识别和识别场景中验证了该方法的有效性。

Conclusion: PolyProtect是一种有前景的模态无关生物特征模板保护方案，适合人道主义紧急场景，计划开源代码以促进进一步研究。

Abstract: In humanitarian and emergency scenarios, the use of biometrics can
dramatically improve the efficiency of operations, but it poses risks for the
data subjects, which are exacerbated in contexts of vulnerability. To address
this, we present a mobile biometric system implementing a biometric template
protection (BTP) scheme suitable for these scenarios. After rigorously
formulating the functional, operational, and security and privacy requirements
of these contexts, we perform a broad comparative analysis of the BTP
landscape. PolyProtect, a method designed to operate on neural network face
embeddings, is identified as the most suitable method due to its effectiveness,
modularity, and lightweight computational burden. We evaluate PolyProtect in
terms of verification and identification accuracy, irreversibility, and
unlinkability, when this BTP method is applied to face embeddings extracted
using EdgeFace, a novel state-of-the-art efficient feature extractor, on a
real-world face dataset from a humanitarian field project in Ethiopia.
Moreover, as PolyProtect promises to be modality-independent, we extend its
evaluation to fingerprints. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
time that PolyProtect has been evaluated for the identification scenario and
for fingerprint biometrics. Our experimental results are promising, and we plan
to release our code

### [9] [Why Relational Graphs Will Save the Next Generation of Vision Foundation Models?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18421)
*Fatemeh Ziaeetabar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文主张在视觉基础模型中引入显式关系接口（动态关系图），以解决现有模型在需要实体、角色和时空关系推理任务上的局限性，提高细粒度语义保真度、泛化能力和计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉基础模型在处理需要显式关系推理的任务（如细粒度人类活动识别、第一人称视频理解和多模态医学图像分析）时存在局限性，这些任务的空间、时间和语义依赖关系对性能至关重要。

Method: 通过在基础模型中添加轻量级、上下文自适应的图推理模块，构建动态关系图（图的拓扑结构和边语义根据输入和任务上下文推断），实现稀疏的语义节点推理。

Result: 实验表明，这种混合方法相比纯基础模型基线，在细粒度语义保真度、分布外鲁棒性、可解释性和计算效率方面都有提升，同时具有更好的内存和硬件效率。

Conclusion: 提出了FM图混合模型的研究议程，重点包括学习动态图构建、多层次关系推理、跨模态融合以及直接测试结构化视觉任务中关系能力的评估协议。

Abstract: Vision foundation models (FMs) have become the predominant architecture in
computer vision, providing highly transferable representations learned from
large-scale, multimodal corpora. Nonetheless, they exhibit persistent
limitations on tasks that require explicit reasoning over entities, roles, and
spatio-temporal relations. Such relational competence is indispensable for
fine-grained human activity recognition, egocentric video understanding, and
multimodal medical image analysis, where spatial, temporal, and semantic
dependencies are decisive for performance. We advance the position that
next-generation FMs should incorporate explicit relational interfaces,
instantiated as dynamic relational graphs (graphs whose topology and edge
semantics are inferred from the input and task context). We illustrate this
position with cross-domain evidence from recent systems in human manipulation
action recognition and brain tumor segmentation, showing that augmenting FMs
with lightweight, context-adaptive graph-reasoning modules improves
fine-grained semantic fidelity, out of distribution robustness,
interpretability, and computational efficiency relative to FM only baselines.
Importantly, by reasoning sparsely over semantic nodes, such hybrids also
achieve favorable memory and hardware efficiency, enabling deployment under
practical resource constraints. We conclude with a targeted research agenda for
FM graph hybrids, prioritizing learned dynamic graph construction, multi-level
relational reasoning (e.g., part object scene in activity understanding, or
region organ in medical imaging), cross-modal fusion, and evaluation protocols
that directly probe relational competence in structured vision tasks.

TL;DR: 提出了一个用于车牌可读性分类的新数据集LPLC，包含10,210张车辆图像和12,687个标注车牌，用于判断车牌是否需要超分辨率处理或完全不可恢复。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决自动车牌识别中低质量车牌识别困难的问题，通过选择性图像预处理来优化模型性能和计算效率。

Method: 采用细粒度标注策略，包括车辆和车牌级别的遮挡、四个可读性类别，并使用ViT、ResNet和YOLO三种图像识别网络作为基准模型进行分类任务。

Result: 所有三个基线模型的整体F1分数均低于80%，表明任务难度较大，需要进一步研究。

Conclusion: 该数据集为车牌可读性分类研究提供了重要资源，现有方法在该任务上表现不佳，凸显了进一步研究的必要性。

Abstract: Automatic License Plate Recognition (ALPR) faces a major challenge when
dealing with illegible license plates (LPs). While reconstruction methods such
as super-resolution (SR) have emerged, the core issue of recognizing these
low-quality LPs remains unresolved. To optimize model performance and
computational efficiency, image pre-processing should be applied selectively to
cases that require enhanced legibility. To support research in this area, we
introduce a novel dataset comprising 10,210 images of vehicles with 12,687
annotated LPs for legibility classification (the LPLC dataset). The images span
a wide range of vehicle types, lighting conditions, and camera/image quality
levels. We adopt a fine-grained annotation strategy that includes vehicle- and
LP-level occlusions, four legibility categories (perfect, good, poor, and
illegible), and character labels for three categories (excluding illegible
LPs). As a benchmark, we propose a classification task using three image
recognition networks to determine whether an LP image is good enough, requires
super-resolution, or is completely unrecoverable. The overall F1 score, which
remained below 80% for all three baseline models (ViT, ResNet, and YOLO),
together with the analyses of SR and LP recognition methods, highlights the
difficulty of the task and reinforces the need for further research. The
proposed dataset is publicly available at
https://github.com/lmlwojcik/lplc-dataset.

Motivation: 解决通用视觉语言模型在医疗任务中诊断准确性有限、模型过大导致推理成本高的问题，为临床部署提供轻量可靠的AI系统

Method: 采用专家-通用框架：轻量级领域训练图像分类器（专家）提供快速准确诊断预测，压缩对话VLM（通用）生成自然语言解释，通过知识图谱检索模块确保回答的事实准确性

Result: 在皮肤病多模态数据集上，相比最强基线（微调未压缩单线VLM），诊断准确率提升18%，平均VRAM需求降低20%，延迟减少5%

Conclusion: 专家-通用系统为构建轻量级、可信赖且临床可行的AI系统提供了实用而强大的范式

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have shown significant potential for medical
tasks; however, their general-purpose nature can limit specialized diagnostic
accuracy, and their large size poses substantial inference costs for real-world
clinical deployment. To address these challenges, we introduce CLARIFY, a
Specialist-Generalist framework for dermatological visual question answering
(VQA). CLARIFY combines two components: (i) a lightweight, domain-trained image
classifier (the Specialist) that provides fast and highly accurate diagnostic
predictions, and (ii) a powerful yet compressed conversational VLM (the
Generalist) that generates natural language explanations to user queries. In
our framework, the Specialist's predictions directly guide the Generalist's
reasoning, focusing it on the correct diagnostic path. This synergy is further
enhanced by a knowledge graph-based retrieval module, which grounds the
Generalist's responses in factual dermatological knowledge, ensuring both
accuracy and reliability. This hierarchical design not only reduces diagnostic
errors but also significantly improves computational efficiency. Experiments on
our curated multimodal dermatology dataset demonstrate that CLARIFY achieves an
18\% improvement in diagnostic accuracy over the strongest baseline, a
fine-tuned, uncompressed single-line VLM, while reducing the average VRAM
requirement and latency by at least 20\% and 5\%, respectively. These results
indicate that a Specialist-Generalist system provides a practical and powerful
paradigm for building lightweight, trustworthy, and clinically viable AI
systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合时空建模和语义理解的零样本异常检测框架，使用TimeSformer、DPC和CLIP的多模态架构，无需异常样本训练即可检测监控视频中的异常事件


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 监控视频中的异常检测具有挑战性，因为异常事件不可预测且高度依赖上下文，需要开发无需异常样本训练的零样本检测方法

Method: 混合架构结合TimeSformer提取时空特征，DPC预测未来表示检测时间偏差，CLIP通过文本提示实现概念级异常检测，使用InfoNCE和CPC损失联合训练，并采用上下文门控机制增强决策

Result: 开发了一个能够泛化到未见行为的异常检测系统，整合了预测建模和视觉语言理解，填补了零样本异常检测中时间推理和语义上下文之间的空白

Conclusion: 该框架通过多模态融合和上下文感知机制，成功实现了对复杂环境中未知异常行为的零样本检测，为监控视频分析提供了有效的解决方案

Abstract: Detecting anomalies in surveillance footage is inherently challenging due to
their unpredictable and context-dependent nature. This work introduces a novel
context-aware zero-shot anomaly detection framework that identifies abnormal
events without exposure to anomaly examples during training. The proposed
hybrid architecture combines TimeSformer, DPC, and CLIP to model spatiotemporal
dynamics and semantic context. TimeSformer serves as the vision backbone to
extract rich spatial-temporal features, while DPC forecasts future
representations to identify temporal deviations. Furthermore, a CLIP-based
semantic stream enables concept-level anomaly detection through
context-specific text prompts. These components are jointly trained using
InfoNCE and CPC losses, aligning visual inputs with their temporal and semantic
representations. A context-gating mechanism further enhances decision-making by
modulating predictions with scene-aware cues or global video features. By
integrating predictive modeling with vision-language understanding, the system
can generalize to previously unseen behaviors in complex environments. This
framework bridges the gap between temporal reasoning and semantic context in
zero-shot anomaly detection for surveillance. The code for this research has
been made available at

*Ajinkya Khoche,Qingwen Zhang,Yixi Cai,Sina Sharif Mansouri,Patric Jensfelt*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DoGFlow是一个无需人工标注的自监督3D场景流估计框架，通过4D雷达多普勒测量生成运动伪标签并转移到LiDAR域，在MAN TruckScenes数据集上显著优于现有自监督方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前自监督方法在长距离和恶劣天气场景下性能不足，而全监督方法依赖昂贵的人工标注难以扩展，需要开发无需人工标注的高性能场景流估计方法。

Method: 提出跨模态标签迁移方法，利用4D雷达多普勒测量实时计算运动伪标签，通过动态感知关联和模糊解析传播将标签转移到LiDAR域。

Result: 在MAN TruckScenes数据集上大幅超越现有自监督方法，仅需10%的真值数据即可达到全监督方法90%以上的性能。

Conclusion: DoGFlow证明了利用雷达多普勒信息进行自监督学习的有效性，为自动驾驶系统在动态环境中的安全导航提供了可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate 3D scene flow estimation is critical for autonomous systems to
navigate dynamic environments safely, but creating the necessary large-scale,
manually annotated datasets remains a significant bottleneck for developing
robust perception models. Current self-supervised methods struggle to match the
performance of fully supervised approaches, especially in challenging
long-range and adverse weather scenarios, while supervised methods are not
scalable due to their reliance on expensive human labeling. We introduce
DoGFlow, a novel self-supervised framework that recovers full 3D object motions
for LiDAR scene flow estimation without requiring any manual ground truth
annotations. This paper presents our cross-modal label transfer approach, where
DoGFlow computes motion pseudo-labels in real-time directly from 4D radar
Doppler measurements and transfers them to the LiDAR domain using dynamic-aware
association and ambiguity-resolved propagation. On the challenging MAN
TruckScenes dataset, DoGFlow substantially outperforms existing self-supervised
methods and improves label efficiency by enabling LiDAR backbones to achieve
over 90% of fully supervised performance with only 10% of the ground truth
data. For more details, please visit https://ajinkyakhoche.github.io/DogFlow/

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SatSkylines是一个3D建筑生成方法，使用卫星图像和粗略几何先验，通过建模从噪声粗先验到详细几何的转换来实现灵活的几何控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于图像的3D生成方法难以从卫星图像的俯视图准确恢复建筑结构，而3D细节化方法过度依赖详细体素输入，无法从简单先验（如立方体）产生满意结果。

Method: 通过建模从插值噪声粗先验到详细几何的转换，实现灵活的几何控制而不增加计算成本。开发了包含5万多个独特风格化3D建筑资产的大规模数据集Skylines-50K。

Result: 广泛评估表明该模型有效且具有强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: SatSkylines方法成功解决了现有方法在从卫星图像生成准确3D建筑结构方面的局限性，通过创新的几何转换建模实现了高质量的3D建筑生成。

Abstract: We present SatSkylines, a 3D building generation approach that takes
satellite imagery and coarse geometric priors. Without proper geometric
guidance, existing image-based 3D generation methods struggle to recover
accurate building structures from the top-down views of satellite images alone.
On the other hand, 3D detailization methods tend to rely heavily on highly
detailed voxel inputs and fail to produce satisfying results from simple priors
such as cuboids. To address these issues, our key idea is to model the
transformation from interpolated noisy coarse priors to detailed geometries,
enabling flexible geometric control without additional computational cost. We
have further developed Skylines-50K, a large-scale dataset of over 50,000
unique and stylized 3D building assets in order to support the generations of
detailed building models. Extensive evaluations indicate the effectiveness of
our model and strong generalization ability.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种检测游戏中可穿越空间过渡点（STP）和主要STP（MSTP）的两阶段深度学习管道，使用Faster R-CNN检测STP，然后通过融合局部和全局视觉特征的轻量级选择器识别MSTP。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在复杂3D游戏环境中，玩家依赖视觉可供性来发现地图过渡点。高效识别这些点对于客户端自动地图绘制至关重要，并为评估地图提示呈现提供了客观基础。

Method: 采用两阶段深度学习管道：第一阶段使用Faster R-CNN检测潜在STP，第二阶段使用轻量级MSTP选择器融合局部和全局视觉特征进行排序。使用参数高效适配器，并引入可选的检索增强融合步骤。

Result: 在五个动作RPG游戏构建的多样化数据集上验证方法。实验显示完整网络微调在充足数据下STP检测效果更好，而仅使用适配器的迁移在低数据场景和MSTP选择任务中更稳健有效。

Conclusion: 通过定义这一新颖问题、提供基线管道和数据集，以及提供高效模型适应的初步见解，旨在为未来AI驱动的导航辅助和数据驱动的关卡设计工具做出贡献。

Abstract: In complex 3D game environments, players rely on visual affordances to spot
map transition points. Efficient identification of such points is important to
client-side auto-mapping, and provides an objective basis for evaluating map
cue presentation. In this work, we formalize the task of detecting traversable
Spatial Transition Points (STPs)-connectors between two sub regions-and
selecting the singular Main STP (MSTP), the unique STP that lies on the
designer-intended critical path toward the player's current macro-objective,
from a single game frame, proposing this as a new research focus. We introduce
a two-stage deep-learning pipeline that first detects potential STPs using
Faster R-CNN and then ranks them with a lightweight MSTP selector that fuses
local and global visual features. Both stages benefit from parameter-efficient
adapters, and we further introduce an optional retrieval-augmented fusion step.
Our primary goal is to establish the feasibility of this problem and set
baseline performance metrics. We validate our approach on a custom-built,
diverse dataset collected from five Action RPG titles. Our experiments reveal a
key trade-off: while full-network fine-tuning produces superior STP detection
with sufficient data, adapter-only transfer is significantly more robust and
effective in low-data scenarios and for the MSTP selection task. By defining
this novel problem, providing a baseline pipeline and dataset, and offering
initial insights into efficient model adaptation, we aim to contribute to
future AI-driven navigation aids and data-informed level-design tools.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前最先进的音频驱动角色动画方法主要适用于语音和歌唱场景，但在需要复杂角色互动、细腻身体动作和动态镜头工作的电影电视制作中存在不足，需要解决实现电影级角色动画的长期挑战。

Method: 提出基于Wan的音频驱动模型Wan-S2V，通过改进模型架构和训练策略来增强在电影场景中的表现力和保真度。

Result: 在与Hunyuan-Avatar和Omnihuman等先进模型的对比实验中，Wan-S2V始终显著优于现有解决方案，同时在长视频生成和精确视频唇形同步编辑等应用中展现出良好的通用性。

Conclusion: Wan-S2V模型成功解决了电影级音频驱动角色动画的挑战，在表达力和保真度方面实现了显著提升，为复杂影视制作提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Current state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods for audio-driven character animation
demonstrate promising performance for scenarios primarily involving speech and
singing. However, they often fall short in more complex film and television
productions, which demand sophisticated elements such as nuanced character
interactions, realistic body movements, and dynamic camera work. To address
this long-standing challenge of achieving film-level character animation, we
propose an audio-driven model, which we refere to as Wan-S2V, built upon Wan.
Our model achieves significantly enhanced expressiveness and fidelity in
cinematic contexts compared to existing approaches. We conducted extensive
experiments, benchmarking our method against cutting-edge models such as
Hunyuan-Avatar and Omnihuman. The experimental results consistently demonstrate
that our approach significantly outperforms these existing solutions.
Additionally, we explore the versatility of our method through its applications
in long-form video generation and precise video lip-sync editing.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出DeReF框架，通过随机特征重组策略解决多模态癌症生存分析中固定融合方案和MoE融合信息交互受限的问题，在肝癌和TCGA数据集上验证有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法面临两个关键挑战：固定融合方案导致模型过度依赖预定义特征组合，限制了特征的动态融合；MoE融合方法中各专家网络处理分离的解耦特征，限制了特征间的信息交互。

Method: 提出DeReF框架，包含模态解耦、随机特征重组和动态MoE融合模块。在解耦模块中使用区域交叉注意力网络提升特征表示质量，通过随机重组增加特征组合多样性。

Result: 在内部肝癌数据集和三个TCGA公共数据集上的广泛实验证实了所提方法的有效性。

Conclusion: DeReF框架通过创新的特征重组策略有效解决了多模态融合中的信息交互限制问题，提升了癌症生存分析的性能。

Abstract: Cancer survival analysis commonly integrates information across diverse
medical modalities to make survival-time predictions. Existing methods
primarily focus on extracting different decoupled features of modalities and
performing fusion operations such as concatenation, attention, and MoE-based
(Mixture-of-Experts) fusion. However, these methods still face two key
challenges: i) Fixed fusion schemes (concatenation and attention) can lead to
model over-reliance on predefined feature combinations, limiting the dynamic
fusion of decoupled features; ii) in MoE-based fusion methods, each expert
network handles separate decoupled features, which limits information
interaction among the decoupled features. To address these challenges, we
propose a novel Decoupling-Reorganization-Fusion framework (DeReF), which
devises a random feature reorganization strategy between modalities decoupling
and dynamic MoE fusion modules.Its advantages are: i) it increases the
diversity of feature combinations and granularity, enhancing the generalization
ability of the subsequent expert networks; ii) it overcomes the problem of
information closure and helps expert networks better capture information among
decoupled features. Additionally, we incorporate a regional cross-attention
network within the modality decoupling module to improve the representation
quality of decoupled features. Extensive experimental results on our in-house
Liver Cancer (LC) and three widely used TCGA public datasets confirm the
effectiveness of our proposed method. The code will be made publicly available.

TL;DR: ROSE是一个视频对象移除框架，专门处理对象移除后的副作用（如阴影、反射等），通过合成数据训练和扩散变换器模型实现高质量的视频修复。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频对象移除方法在处理对象副作用（阴影、反射、光照、半透明和镜面效果）时表现不佳，主要缺乏配对的监督数据。

Method: 使用3D渲染引擎生成合成数据，构建大规模配对数据集；基于扩散变换器构建视频修复模型；引入额外监督显式预测副作用区域；通过差分掩码定位受影响区域。

Result: ROSE在多种副作用移除任务上表现优异，优于现有视频对象擦除模型，并能很好地泛化到真实世界视频场景。

Conclusion: ROSE框架通过系统性处理对象副作用，结合合成数据生成和先进的视频修复技术，为视频对象移除提供了全面解决方案，并在新基准测试中展现了卓越性能。

Abstract: Video object removal has achieved advanced performance due to the recent
success of video generative models. However, when addressing the side effects
of objects, e.g., their shadows and reflections, existing works struggle to
eliminate these effects for the scarcity of paired video data as supervision.
This paper presents ROSE, termed Remove Objects with Side Effects, a framework
that systematically studies the object's effects on environment, which can be
categorized into five common cases: shadows, reflections, light, translucency
and mirror. Given the challenges of curating paired videos exhibiting the
aforementioned effects, we leverage a 3D rendering engine for synthetic data
generation. We carefully construct a fully-automatic pipeline for data
preparation, which simulates a large-scale paired dataset with diverse scenes,
objects, shooting angles, and camera trajectories. ROSE is implemented as an
video inpainting model built on diffusion transformer. To localize all
object-correlated areas, the entire video is fed into the model for
reference-based erasing. Moreover, additional supervision is introduced to
explicitly predict the areas affected by side effects, which can be revealed
through the differential mask between the paired videos. To fully investigate
the model performance on various side effect removal, we presents a new
benchmark, dubbed ROSE-Bench, incorporating both common scenarios and the five
special side effects for comprehensive evaluation. Experimental results
demonstrate that ROSE achieves superior performance compared to existing video
object erasing models and generalizes well to real-world video scenarios. The

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了OwlCap模型和HMD-270K数据集，解决视频描述中运动与细节失衡问题，在两个测试集上都取得显著攻加。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频描述方法存在运动-细节失衡问题，模型往往过度偏重某一方面而忽略另一方面，导致描述不完整和不一致性问题。

Method: 从两个方面入手：1）数据方面：通过两阶段流程（运动-细节融合和细粒度审查）构建HMD-270K数据集；2）优化方面：基于组相对策略优化提出标题集等效奖励，通过单元-集匹配和双向验证提升完整性和准确性。

Result: OwlCap模型在两个测试集上都取得显著攻加：细节偏重的VDC数据集上Acc指标提升4.2，运动偏重的DREAM-1K数据集上F1指标提升4.6。

Conclusion: 该研究有效解决了视频描述中的运动-细节失衡问题，OwlCap模型和HMD-270K数据集将公开发布以促进视频描述研究的发展。

Abstract: Video captioning aims to generate comprehensive and coherent descriptions of
the video content, contributing to the advancement of both video understanding
and generation. However, existing methods often suffer from motion-detail
imbalance, as models tend to overemphasize one aspect while neglecting the
other. This imbalance results in incomplete captions, which in turn leads to a
lack of consistency in video understanding and generation. To address this
issue, we propose solutions from two aspects: 1) Data aspect: We constructed
the Harmonizing Motion-Detail 270K (HMD-270K) dataset through a two-stage
pipeline: Motion-Detail Fusion (MDF) and Fine-Grained Examination (FGE). 2)
Optimization aspect: We introduce the Caption Set Equivalence Reward (CSER)
based on Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). CSER enhances completeness
and accuracy in capturing both motion and details through unit-to-set matching
and bidirectional validation. Based on the HMD-270K supervised fine-tuning and
GRPO post-training with CSER, we developed OwlCap, a powerful video captioning
multi-modal large language model (MLLM) with motion-detail balance.
Experimental results demonstrate that OwlCap achieves significant improvements
compared to baseline models on two benchmarks: the detail-focused VDC (+4.2
Acc) and the motion-focused DREAM-1K (+4.6 F1). The HMD-270K dataset and OwlCap
model will be publicly released to facilitate video captioning research
community advancements.

Result: 在三个主流检测框架（Faster R-CNN、DETR和Sparse R-CNN）上进行实验，所有框架都表现出显著的性能提升

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了甲骨文拓片图像检测中的挑战，通过聚类特征表示学习显著提升了检测性能

Abstract: Oracle Bone Inscriptions (OBIs), play a crucial role in understanding ancient
Chinese civilization. The automated detection of OBIs from rubbing images
represents a fundamental yet challenging task in digital archaeology, primarily
due to various degradation factors including noise and cracks that limit the
effectiveness of conventional detection networks. To address these challenges,
we propose a novel clustering-based feature space representation learning
method. Our approach uniquely leverages the Oracle Bones Character (OBC) font
library dataset as prior knowledge to enhance feature extraction in the
detection network through clustering-based representation learning. The method
incorporates a specialized loss function derived from clustering results to
optimize feature representation, which is then integrated into the total
network loss. We validate the effectiveness of our method by conducting
experiments on two OBIs detection dataset using three mainstream detection
frameworks: Faster R-CNN, DETR, and Sparse R-CNN. Through extensive
experimentation, all frameworks demonstrate significant performance
improvements.

TL;DR: 提出了SFormer方法，通过频域SNR先验和傅里叶注意力机制，结合频率自适应变换器，有效提升水下图像增强效果


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于SNR先验的水下图像增强方法在空间域存在两个局限：无法有效分离跨通道干扰，以及在放大信息结构和抑制噪声方面帮助有限

Method: 提出频域SNR先验，将特征分解为振幅和相位谱；设计傅里叶注意力SNR先验变换器(FAST)和频率自适应变换器(FAT)；采用U型架构整合常规RGB流和SNR引导分支

Result: 在UIEB、EUVP和LSUI数据集的4800对图像上训练，PSNR提升3.1dB，SSIM提升0.08，成功恢复水下场景的颜色、纹理和对比度

Conclusion: 频域SNR先验比空间域方法更有效，SFormer在性能指标和视觉质量上都超越了现有方法

Abstract: Recent learning-based underwater image enhancement (UIE) methods have
advanced by incorporating physical priors into deep neural networks,
particularly using the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) prior to reduce
wavelength-dependent attenuation. However, spatial domain SNR priors have two
limitations: (i) they cannot effectively separate cross-channel interference,
and (ii) they provide limited help in amplifying informative structures while
suppressing noise. To overcome these, we propose using the SNR prior in the
frequency domain, decomposing features into amplitude and phase spectra for
better channel modulation. We introduce the Fourier Attention SNR-prior
Transformer (FAST), combining spectral interactions with SNR cues to highlight
key spectral components. Additionally, the Frequency Adaptive Transformer (FAT)
bottleneck merges low- and high-frequency branches using a gated attention
mechanism to enhance perceptual quality. Embedded in a unified U-shaped
architecture, these modules integrate a conventional RGB stream with an
SNR-guided branch, forming SFormer. Trained on 4,800 paired images from UIEB,
EUVP, and LSUI, SFormer surpasses recent methods with a 3.1 dB gain in PSNR and
0.08 in SSIM, successfully restoring colors, textures, and contrast in
underwater scenes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究虽然实现了良好的分割性能，但在EF估计方面表现不佳，需要解决单帧处理的局部误差累积和多帧处理的细节忽略问题

Method: 采用分层设计：低层级使用卷积网络处理单帧图像保留细节，高层级使用Mamba架构捕捉时空关系；提出时空交叉扫描(STCS)模块通过跨帧跨位置跳跃扫描整合长程上下文

Result: 该方法能够平衡单帧和多帧处理，避免超声图像噪声等因素导致的EF计算偏差

Conclusion: 分层时空分割网络通过协同局部细节建模和全局动态感知，有效提高了超声心动图视频中EF估计的准确性

Abstract: Automated segmentation of the left ventricular endocardium in
echocardiography videos is a key research area in cardiology. It aims to
provide accurate assessment of cardiac structure and function through Ejection
Fraction (EF) estimation. Although existing studies have achieved good
segmentation performance, their results do not perform well in EF estimation.
In this paper, we propose a Hierarchical Spatio-temporal Segmentation Network
(\ourmodel) for echocardiography video, aiming to improve EF estimation
accuracy by synergizing local detail modeling with global dynamic perception.
The network employs a hierarchical design, with low-level stages using
convolutional networks to process single-frame images and preserve details,
while high-level stages utilize the Mamba architecture to capture
spatio-temporal relationships. The hierarchical design balances single-frame
and multi-frame processing, avoiding issues such as local error accumulation
when relying solely on single frames or neglecting details when using only
multi-frame data. To overcome local spatio-temporal limitations, we propose the
Spatio-temporal Cross Scan (STCS) module, which integrates long-range context
through skip scanning across frames and positions. This approach helps mitigate
EF calculation biases caused by ultrasound image noise and other factors.

TL;DR: FPS是一种新颖的无监督域适应框架，通过冻结预训练特征编码器并优化决策边界来解决域偏移问题，避免了传统微调方法的低效性和不可预测性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前无监督域适应方法主要依赖微调特征提取器，存在效率低、可解释性差和扩展性不足的问题。研究发现预训练模型的特征空间具有域不变的几何模式，域偏移主要表现为边界错位而非特征退化。

Method: 提出特征空间平面搜索器(FPS)框架，冻结预训练特征编码器，利用特征空间的几何模式（类内聚类和类间分离）优化决策边界，实现离线特征提取和全数据集单次计算优化。

Result: 在公共基准测试中，FPS达到或超越了最先进方法的性能，能够高效扩展到多模态大模型，并在蛋白质结构预测、遥感分类和地震检测等多个领域展现出色表现。

Conclusion: FPS提供了一个简单、有效且通用的迁移学习范式，特别适用于域适应任务，显著降低了内存和计算成本，同时保持了模型的可解释性。

Abstract: Domain shift, characterized by degraded model performance during transition
from labeled source domains to unlabeled target domains, poses a persistent
challenge for deploying deep learning systems. Current unsupervised domain
adaptation (UDA) methods predominantly rely on fine-tuning feature extractors -
an approach limited by inefficiency, reduced interpretability, and poor
scalability to modern architectures.
  Our analysis reveals that models pretrained on large-scale data exhibit
domain-invariant geometric patterns in their feature space, characterized by
intra-class clustering and inter-class separation, thereby preserving
transferable discriminative structures. These findings indicate that domain
shifts primarily manifest as boundary misalignment rather than feature
degradation.
  Unlike fine-tuning entire pre-trained models - which risks introducing
unpredictable feature distortions - we propose the Feature-space Planes
Searcher (FPS): a novel domain adaptation framework that optimizes decision
boundaries by leveraging these geometric patterns while keeping the feature
encoder frozen. This streamlined approach enables interpretative analysis of
adaptation while substantially reducing memory and computational costs through
offline feature extraction, permitting full-dataset optimization in a single
computation cycle.
  Evaluations on public benchmarks demonstrate that FPS achieves competitive or
superior performance to state-of-the-art methods. FPS scales efficiently with
multimodal large models and shows versatility across diverse domains including
protein structure prediction, remote sensing classification, and earthquake
detection. We anticipate FPS will provide a simple, effective, and
generalizable paradigm for transfer learning, particularly in domain adaptation
tasks. .

Abstract: Human Activity Recognition (HAR) plays a pivotal role in various
applications, including smart surveillance, healthcare, assistive technologies,
sports analytics, etc. However, HAR systems still face critical challenges,
including high computational costs, redundant features, and limited scalability
in real-time scenarios. An optimized hybrid deep learning framework is
introduced that integrates a customized InceptionV3, an LSTM architecture, and
a novel ensemble-based feature selection strategy. The proposed framework first
extracts spatial descriptors using the customized InceptionV3 model, which
captures multilevel contextual patterns, region homogeneity, and fine-grained
localization cues. The temporal dependencies across frames are then modeled
using LSTMs to effectively encode motion dynamics. Finally, an ensemble-based
genetic algorithm with Adaptive Dynamic Fitness Sharing and Attention (ADFSA)
is employed to select a compact and optimized feature set by dynamically
balancing objectives such as accuracy, redundancy, uniqueness, and complexity
reduction. Consequently, the selected feature subsets, which are both diverse
and discriminative, enable various lightweight machine learning classifiers to
achieve accurate and robust HAR in heterogeneous environments. Experimental
results on the robust UCF-YouTube dataset, which presents challenges such as
occlusion, cluttered backgrounds, motion dynamics, and poor illumination,

*Qun Ji,Peng Li,Mingqiang Wei*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ColorGS是一个用于内窥镜视频中可变形组织重建的新框架，通过自适应颜色编码和增强形变建模，在保持实时渲染效率的同时实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在捕捉细微颜色变化和建模全局形变方面存在局限，3D高斯泼溅的固定颜色分配和线性形变建模无法处理复杂纹理和一致全局形变。

Method: 提出Colored Gaussian Primitives使用动态锚点和可学习颜色参数自适应编码空间变化纹理；设计Enhanced Deformation Model结合时间感知高斯基函数和可学习时间无关形变，精确捕捉局部组织形变和全局运动一致性。

Result: 在DaVinci机器人手术视频和基准数据集上，ColorGS达到PSNR 39.85（比先前3DGS方法高1.5）和SSIM 97.25%的优异性能，同时保持实时渲染效率。

Conclusion: ColorGS通过平衡高保真度和计算实用性，推进了手术场景重建技术，对术中指导和AR/VR应用具有重要意义。

Abstract: High-fidelity reconstruction of deformable tissues from endoscopic videos
remains challenging due to the limitations of existing methods in capturing
subtle color variations and modeling global deformations. While 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS) enables efficient dynamic reconstruction, its fixed
per-Gaussian color assignment struggles with intricate textures, and linear
deformation modeling fails to model consistent global deformation. To address
these issues, we propose ColorGS, a novel framework that integrates spatially
adaptive color encoding and enhanced deformation modeling for surgical scene
reconstruction. First, we introduce Colored Gaussian Primitives, which employ
dynamic anchors with learnable color parameters to adaptively encode spatially
varying textures, significantly improving color expressiveness under complex
lighting and tissue similarity. Second, we design an Enhanced Deformation Model
(EDM) that combines time-aware Gaussian basis functions with learnable
time-independent deformations, enabling precise capture of both localized
tissue deformations and global motion consistency caused by surgical
interactions. Extensive experiments on DaVinci robotic surgery videos and
benchmark datasets (EndoNeRF, StereoMIS) demonstrate that ColorGS achieves
state-of-the-art performance, attaining a PSNR of 39.85 (1.5 higher than prior
3DGS-based methods) and superior SSIM (97.25\%) while maintaining real-time
rendering efficiency. Our work advances surgical scene reconstruction by
balancing high fidelity with computational practicality, critical for
intraoperative guidance and AR/VR applications.

*Hiroaki Aizawa,Yuta Naito,Kohei Fukuda*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了类别级洪水正则化方法，通过在类别层面应用洪水正则化来解决不平衡数据集中的少数类识别性能下降问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当神经网络在不平衡数据集上训练时，模型预测倾向于偏向多数类，导致少数类的识别性能显著下降。

Method: 扩展洪水正则化到类别层面，根据类别频率为每个类别分配特定的洪水水平，抑制多数类的过拟合同时允许少数类充分学习。

Result: 在不平衡图像分类任务上验证，相比传统洪水正则化方法，提高了少数类的分类性能并获得了更好的整体泛化能力。

Conclusion: 类别级洪水正则化是处理不平衡数据集分类问题的有效方法，能够改善少数类的识别性能。

Abstract: The purpose of training neural networks is to achieve high generalization
performance on unseen inputs. However, when trained on imbalanced datasets, a
model's prediction tends to favor majority classes over minority classes,
leading to significant degradation in the recognition performance of minority
classes. To address this issue, we propose class-wise flooding regularization,
an extension of flooding regularization applied at the class level. Flooding is
a regularization technique that mitigates overfitting by preventing the
training loss from falling below a predefined threshold, known as the flooding
level, thereby discouraging memorization. Our proposed method assigns a
class-specific flooding level based on class frequencies. By doing so, it
suppresses overfitting in majority classes while allowing sufficient learning
for minority classes. We validate our approach on imbalanced image
classification. Compared to conventional flooding regularizations, our method
improves the classification performance of minority classes and achieves better
overall generalization.

*Hiroaki Aizawa,Yoshikazu Hayashi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出ADM难度度量方法，结合课程学习和SAM优化，解决平坦区域中样本难度评估难题，提升模型泛化性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统课程学习依赖损失值或梯度大小来评估样本难度，但在平坦最小值区域这些指标变得不敏感，难以有效设计课程。需要一种在平坦区域仍能准确评估样本难度的方法

Method: 提出对抗难度度量(ADM)，通过计算原始样本与对抗样本之间的归一化损失差距来量化样本的对抗脆弱性。将ADM集成到基于课程学习的SAM训练中，动态评估样本难度

Result: 在图像分类、细粒度识别和领域泛化任务上评估，方法保留了课程学习和SAM的优势，超越了现有的课程学习和平坦感知训练策略

Conclusion: ADM提供了一种在平坦最小值区域有效评估样本难度的方法，成功结合了课程学习和SAM的优势，显著提升了模型的泛化能力

Abstract: Neural networks trained by empirical risk minimization often suffer from
overfitting, especially to specific samples or domains, which leads to poor
generalization. Curriculum Learning (CL) addresses this issue by selecting
training samples based on the difficulty. From the optimization perspective,
methods such as Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) improve robustness and
generalization by seeking flat minima. However, combining CL with SAM is not
straightforward. In flat regions, both the loss values and the gradient norms
tend to become uniformly small, which makes it difficult to evaluate sample
difficulty and design an effective curriculum. To overcome this problem, we
propose the Adversarial Difficulty Measure (ADM), which quantifies adversarial
vulnerability by leveraging the robustness properties of models trained toward
flat minima. Unlike loss- or gradient-based measures, which become ineffective
as training progresses into flatter regions, ADM remains informative by
measuring the normalized loss gap between original and adversarial examples. We
incorporate ADM into CL-based training with SAM to dynamically assess sample
difficulty. We evaluated our approach on image classification tasks,
fine-grained recognition, and domain generalization. The results demonstrate
that our method preserves the strengths of both CL and SAM while outperforming
existing curriculum-based and flatness-aware training strategies.

*Melanie Wille,Tobias Fischer,Scarlett Raine*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文通过分析水下目标检测中的性能差异，发现定位阶段的前景-背景区分是最关键问题，分类阶段存在固有特征挑战，建议根据精度或召回率优先选择不同的数据分布策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 水下目标检测面临图像质量退化、类别分布不平衡和独特视觉特征等挑战，不同物种检测性能差异显著但原因不明，需要探究数据量之外的影响因素并系统提升表现不佳的海洋物种检测。

Method: 使用DUO数据集，将目标检测任务分解为定位和分类两个阶段，利用YOLO11和TIDE工具分析扇贝类别的性能问题，进行定位分析和分类实验来研究数据平衡性影响。

Result: 定位分析发现前景-背景区分是最困难阶段且不受数据量影响；分类实验显示即使数据平衡仍存在精度差距，表明存在超越数据稀缺和类间依赖的固有特征挑战。

Conclusion: 优先精度时应使用不平衡分布，优先召回率时使用平衡分布；改进表现不佳类别应重点关注算法进步，特别是在定位模块方面；公开了代码和数据集。

Abstract: Underwater object detection is critical for monitoring marine ecosystems but
poses unique challenges, including degraded image quality, imbalanced class
distribution, and distinct visual characteristics. Not every species is
detected equally well, yet underlying causes remain unclear. We address two key
research questions: 1) What factors beyond data quantity drive class-specific
performance disparities? 2) How can we systematically improve detection of
under-performing marine species? We manipulate the DUO dataset to separate the
object detection task into localization and classification and investigate the
under-performance of the scallop class. Localization analysis using YOLO11 and
TIDE finds that foreground-background discrimination is the most problematic
stage regardless of data quantity. Classification experiments reveal persistent
precision gaps even with balanced data, indicating intrinsic feature-based
challenges beyond data scarcity and inter-class dependencies. We recommend
imbalanced distributions when prioritizing precision, and balanced
distributions when prioritizing recall. Improving under-performing classes
should focus on algorithmic advances, especially within localization modules.
We publicly release our code and datasets.

TL;DR: Drawing2CAD是一个从2D工程图自动生成参数化CAD模型的序列到序列学习框架，通过双解码器transformer架构保持几何精度和设计意图。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CAD生成方法主要从点云、网格或文本输入生成实体模型，但与传统工业工作流程（从2D工程图开始）存在根本差异，从2D矢量图自动生成参数化CAD模型的研究仍然不足。

Method: 提出Drawing2CAD框架，包含三个关键技术组件：网络友好的矢量图元表示、双解码器transformer架构（解耦命令类型和参数生成）、软目标分布损失函数。创建了CAD-VGDrawing配对数据集进行训练和评估。

Result: 通过全面实验证明了方法的有效性，能够保持几何精度和设计意图，实现从2D工程图到参数化CAD模型的自动转换。

Conclusion: 该研究填补了从2D工程图自动生成参数化CAD模型的关键空白，提出的框架在保持几何精度的同时实现了设计意图的完整传递，对工业设计流程具有重要意义。

Abstract: Computer-Aided Design (CAD) generative modeling is driving significant
innovations across industrial applications. Recent works have shown remarkable
progress in creating solid models from various inputs such as point clouds,
meshes, and text descriptions. However, these methods fundamentally diverge
from traditional industrial workflows that begin with 2D engineering drawings.
The automatic generation of parametric CAD models from these 2D vector drawings
remains underexplored despite being a critical step in engineering design. To
address this gap, our key insight is to reframe CAD generation as a
sequence-to-sequence learning problem where vector drawing primitives directly
inform the generation of parametric CAD operations, preserving geometric
precision and design intent throughout the transformation process. We propose
Drawing2CAD, a framework with three key technical components: a
network-friendly vector primitive representation that preserves precise
geometric information, a dual-decoder transformer architecture that decouples
command type and parameter generation while maintaining precise correspondence,
and a soft target distribution loss function accommodating inherent flexibility
in CAD parameters. To train and evaluate Drawing2CAD, we create CAD-VGDrawing,
a dataset of paired engineering drawings and parametric CAD models, and conduct
thorough experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. Code and
dataset are available at https://github.com/lllssc/Drawing2CAD.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有系统在噪声环境中难以准确估计音频可靠性并动态调整模态依赖，导致视听语音识别性能下降

Method: 使用音频-视觉特征融合的路由器，基于token级声学损坏分数自适应重新加权音频和视觉特征，通过门控交叉注意力机制在解码器层中增强视觉线索

Result: 在LRS3数据集上相比AV-HuBERT实现了16.51-42.67%的相对词错误率降低，消融研究证实路由器和门控机制都提高了在真实声学噪声下的鲁棒性

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效在音频质量恶化时转向视觉模态，显著提升了噪声环境下的视听语音识别性能

Abstract: Robust audio-visual speech recognition (AVSR) in noisy environments remains
challenging, as existing systems struggle to estimate audio reliability and
dynamically adjust modality reliance. We propose router-gated cross-modal
feature fusion, a novel AVSR framework that adaptively reweights audio and
visual features based on token-level acoustic corruption scores. Using an
audio-visual feature fusion-based router, our method down-weights unreliable
audio tokens and reinforces visual cues through gated cross-attention in each
decoder layer. This enables the model to pivot toward the visual modality when
audio quality deteriorates. Experiments on LRS3 demonstrate that our approach
achieves an 16.51-42.67% relative reduction in word error rate compared to
AV-HuBERT. Ablation studies confirm that both the router and gating mechanism
contribute to improved robustness under real-world acoustic noise.

### [32] [Rethinking Human-Object Interaction Evaluation for both Vision-Language Models and HOI-Specific Methods](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18753)
*Qinqian Lei,Bo Wang,Robby T. Tan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个新的人物交互检测评测标准，将HOI检测重构为多选题任务，以适应生成式视觉语言模型的特性，避免因正确预测与标注不完全匹配而被罚分的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的HOI检测标准在评价生成式VLM时存在问题：需要严格匹配标注类别，而图片常常存在多种合理解释。这导致合理预测被错误罚分，无法公平评估VLM和专门HOI方法的性能。

Method: 设计了一个新的多选题式评测协议：每个问题包含真实正确选项和细心筛选的负面选项（避免将合理的替代解释作为负面样本），将HOI检测重构为多答案多选题任务。

Result: 该新评测协议是首个能同时适用于VLM和专门HOI方法的标准，允许直接对比两种方法的性能，为HOI理解领域的进展提供新的见解。

Conclusion: 通过重构HOI检测为多选题形式，本文解决了现有标准在评价生成式VLM时的不匹配问题，为公平评估不同方法的HOI理解能力提供了有效的评测框架。

Abstract: Prior human-object interaction (HOI) detection methods have integrated early
vision-language models (VLMs) such as CLIP, but only as supporting components
within their frameworks. In contrast, recent advances in large, generative VLMs
suggest that these models may already possess strong ability to understand
images involving HOI. This naturally raises an important question: can
general-purpose standalone VLMs effectively solve HOI detection, and how do
they compare with specialized HOI methods? Answering this requires a benchmark
that can accommodate both paradigms. However, existing HOI benchmarks such as
HICO-DET were developed before the emergence of modern VLMs, and their
evaluation protocols require exact matches to annotated HOI classes. This is
poorly aligned with the generative nature of VLMs, which often yield multiple
valid interpretations in ambiguous cases. For example, a static image may
capture a person mid-motion with a frisbee, which can plausibly be interpreted
as either "throwing" or "catching". When only "catching" is annotated, the
other, though equally plausible for the image, is marked incorrect when exact
matching is used. As a result, correct predictions might be penalized,
affecting both VLMs and HOI-specific methods. To avoid penalizing valid
predictions, we introduce a new benchmark that reformulates HOI detection as a
multiple-answer multiple-choice task, where each question includes only
ground-truth positive options and a curated set of negatives that are
constructed to reduce ambiguity (e.g., when "catching" is annotated, "throwing"
is not selected as a negative to avoid penalizing valid predictions). The
proposed evaluation protocol is the first of its kind for both VLMs and HOI
methods, enabling direct comparison and offering new insight into the current
state of progress in HOI understanding.

TL;DR: 提出了CmOS框架，用于生成带有视觉选项的教育选择题，通过多模态思维链和检索增强生成技术，解决了传统文本选项生成方法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统选择题生成主要关注文本选项，忽视了视觉选项的重要性，且高质量干扰项的手工制作成本高、可扩展性差。

Method: 采用跨模态选项合成框架，整合多模态思维链推理和检索增强生成技术，生成语义合理且视觉相似的答案和干扰项，并包含内容判别模块识别适合视觉选项的内容。

Result: 实验结果表明，CmOS在内容判别、问题生成和视觉选项生成方面优于现有方法，适用于不同学科和教育层次。

Conclusion: CmOS框架有效解决了教育选择题中视觉选项生成的挑战，为自动化生成高质量多选题提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Multiple-choice questions (MCQs) play a crucial role in fostering deep
thinking and knowledge integration in education. However, previous research has
primarily focused on generating MCQs with textual options, but it largely
overlooks the visual options. Moreover, generating high-quality distractors
remains a major challenge due to the high cost and limited scalability of
manual authoring. To tackle these problems, we propose a Cross-modal Options
Synthesis (CmOS), a novel framework for generating educational MCQs with visual
options. Our framework integrates Multimodal Chain-of-Thought (MCoT) reasoning
process and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to produce semantically
plausible and visually similar answer and distractors. It also includes a
discrimination module to identify content suitable for visual options.
Experimental results on test tasks demonstrate the superiority of CmOS in
content discrimination, question generation and visual option generation over
existing methods across various subjects and educational levels.

Abstract: The growing integration of smart environments and low-power computing
devices, coupled with mass-market sensor technologies, is driving advancements
in remote and non-contact physiological monitoring. However, deploying these
systems in real-time on resource-constrained platforms introduces significant
challenges related to scalability, interoperability, and performance. This
paper presents a real-time remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) system optimized
for low-power devices, designed to extract physiological signals, such as heart
rate (HR), respiratory rate (RR), and oxygen saturation (SpO2), from facial
video streams. The system is built on the Face2PPG pipeline, which processes
video frames sequentially for rPPG signal extraction and analysis, while
leveraging a multithreaded architecture to manage video capture, real-time
processing, network communication, and graphical user interface (GUI) updates
concurrently. This design ensures continuous, reliable operation at 30 frames
per second (fps), with adaptive feedback through a collaborative user interface
to guide optimal signal capture conditions. The network interface includes both
an HTTP server for continuous video streaming and a RESTful API for on-demand
vital sign retrieval. To ensure accurate performance despite the limitations of
low-power devices, we use a hybrid programming model combining Functional
Reactive Programming (FRP) and the Actor Model, allowing event-driven
processing and efficient task parallelization. The system is evaluated under
real-time constraints, demonstrating robustness while minimizing computational
overhead. Our work addresses key challenges in real-time biosignal monitoring,
offering practical solutions for optimizing performance in modern healthcare
and human-computer interaction applications.

Conclusion: PseudoMapTrainer为在线地图提供了一种经济高效且可扩展的训练方案，解决了对昂贵标注数据的依赖问题

Abstract: Online mapping models show remarkable results in predicting vectorized maps
from multi-view camera images only. However, all existing approaches still rely
on ground-truth high-definition maps during training, which are expensive to
obtain and often not geographically diverse enough for reliable generalization.
In this work, we propose PseudoMapTrainer, a novel approach to online mapping
that uses pseudo-labels generated from unlabeled sensor data. We derive those
pseudo-labels by reconstructing the road surface from multi-camera imagery
using Gaussian splatting and semantics of a pre-trained 2D segmentation
network. In addition, we introduce a mask-aware assignment algorithm and loss
function to handle partially masked pseudo-labels, allowing for the first time
the training of online mapping models without any ground-truth maps.
Furthermore, our pseudo-labels can be effectively used to pre-train an online
model in a semi-supervised manner to leverage large-scale unlabeled
crowdsourced data. The code is available at

Abstract: Effective waste sorting is critical for sustainable recycling, yet AI
research in this domain continues to lag behind commercial systems due to
limited datasets and reliance on legacy object detectors. In this work, we
advance AI-driven waste detection by establishing strong baselines and
introducing an ensemble-based semi-supervised learning framework. We first
benchmark state-of-the-art Open-Vocabulary Object Detection (OVOD) models on
the real-world ZeroWaste dataset, demonstrating that while class-only prompts
perform poorly, LLM-optimized prompts significantly enhance zero-shot accuracy.
Next, to address domain-specific limitations, we fine-tune modern
transformer-based detectors, achieving a new baseline of 51.6 mAP. We then
propose a soft pseudo-labeling strategy that fuses ensemble predictions using
spatial and consensus-aware weighting, enabling robust semi-supervised
training. Applied to the unlabeled ZeroWaste-s subset, our pseudo-annotations
achieve performance gains that surpass fully supervised training, underscoring
the effectiveness of scalable annotation pipelines. Our work contributes to the
research community by establishing rigorous baselines, introducing a robust
ensemble-based pseudo-labeling pipeline, generating high-quality annotations
for the unlabeled ZeroWaste-s subset, and systematically evaluating OVOD models
under real-world waste sorting conditions. Our code is available at:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新题的印象标签嵌入方法，利用字体形状与印象关系来生成更准确的字体印象表征，在印象导向的字体生成任务中表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 不同字体样式传递不同印象，字体形状与印象标签存在紧密关系。标准词嵌入方法（如BERT和CLIP）在这种特定应用中表现不佳，需要专门的印象表征方法。

Method: 构建印象标签关系图（节点为印象标签，边为共现关系），然后应用谱嵌入技术获取每个标签的印象向量。

Result: 在定性和定量评估中，该方法比BERT和CLIP表现更好，能够为经常共现的印象标签分配相似向量，更适合印象导向的字体生成和检索任务。

Conclusion: 通过利用字体形状与印象的关联性，该研究成功开发了一种专门的印象标签嵌入方法，在字体印象表征方面显著优于通用的词嵌入方法。

Abstract: Different font styles (i.e., font shapes) convey distinct impressions,
indicating a close relationship between font shapes and word tags describing
those impressions. This paper proposes a novel embedding method for impression
tags that leverages these shape-impression relationships. For instance, our
method assigns similar vectors to impression tags that frequently co-occur in
order to represent impressions of fonts, whereas standard word embedding
methods (e.g., BERT and CLIP) yield very different vectors. This property is
particularly useful for impression-based font generation and font retrieval.
Technically, we construct a graph whose nodes represent impression tags and
whose edges encode co-occurrence relationships. Then, we apply spectral
embedding to obtain the impression vectors for each tag. We compare our method
with BERT and CLIP in qualitative and quantitative evaluations, demonstrating
that our approach performs better in impression-guided font generation.

Motivation: 传统国家森林资源清查(NFI)依赖人工实地调查，成本高且更新频率低。虽然遥感技术结合机器学习提供了解决方案，但现有方法主要依赖随机森林分类器和手工设计的物候特征，分类精度有限。

Method: 使用Google Earth Engine提取Sentinel-1、Sentinel-2、ERA5卫星和SRTM数据的时间序列，然后微调公开可用的预训练遥感时间序列基础模型，利用深度学习特征进行树种分类。

Result: 在荷兰NFI分类任务中，微调预训练模型的表现显著优于当前最先进方法，在所有数据集上准确率提升幅度高达10%。

Conclusion: 传统手工设计的谐波特征过于简单，而深度学习特征在数据有限的应用（如NFI分类）中具有巨大潜力。通过利用开放卫星数据和预训练模型，该方法能有效补充现有森林清查流程。

Abstract: National Forest Inventory (NFI)s serve as the primary source of forest
information, providing crucial tree species distribution data. However,
maintaining these inventories requires labor-intensive on-site campaigns.
Remote sensing approaches, particularly when combined with machine learning,
offer opportunities to update NFIs more frequently and at larger scales. While
the use of Satellite Image Time Series has proven effective for distinguishing
tree species through seasonal canopy reflectance patterns, current approaches
rely primarily on Random Forest classifiers with hand-designed features and
phenology-based metrics. Using deep features from an available pre-trained
remote sensing foundation models offers a complementary strategy. These
pre-trained models leverage unannotated global data and are meant to used for
general-purpose applications and can then be efficiently fine-tuned with
smaller labeled datasets for specific classification tasks. This work
systematically investigates how deep features improve tree species
classification accuracy in the Netherlands with few annotated data. Data-wise,
we extracted time-series data from Sentinel-1, Sentinel-2 and ERA5 satellites
data and SRTM data using Google Earth Engine. Our results demonstrate that
fine-tuning a publicly available remote sensing time series foundation model
outperforms the current state-of-the-art in NFI classification in the
Netherlands by a large margin of up to 10% across all datasets. This
demonstrates that classic hand-defined harmonic features are too simple for
this task and highlights the potential of using deep AI features for
data-limited application like NFI classification. By leveraging openly
available satellite data and pre-trained models, this approach significantly
improves classification accuracy compared to traditional methods and can
effectively complement existing forest inventory processes.

Abstract: This paper presents our solution for the MIDOG 2025 Challenge Track 2, which
focuses on binary classification of normal mitotic figures (NMFs) versus
atypical mitotic figures (AMFs) in histopathological images. Our approach
leverages a ConvNeXt V2 base model with center cropping preprocessing and

TL;DR: 提出了一种先验引导的视频级回归方法用于微表情分析，通过可扩展的区间选择策略和协同优化框架，在多个基准数据集上实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有微表情分析方法主要依赖固定窗口大小的窗口级分类，难以捕捉微表情的复杂时间动态特性。虽然近期方法采用视频级回归框架，但区间解码仍依赖手动预定义的基于窗口的方法，问题仅得到部分缓解。

Method: 提出先验引导的视频级回归方法，引入可扩展的区间选择策略，综合考虑微表情的时间演化、持续时间和类别分布特征，能够精确定位起始、顶点和偏移阶段。同时采用协同优化框架，让定位和识别任务共享除分类头外的参数。

Conclusion: 该方法通过创新的区间选择策略和协同优化设计，有效解决了微表情分析中的时序动态捕捉问题，显著提升了分析性能。

Abstract: Micro-expressions (MEs) are involuntary, low-intensity, and short-duration
facial expressions that often reveal an individual's genuine thoughts and
emotions. Most existing ME analysis methods rely on window-level classification
with fixed window sizes and hard decisions, which limits their ability to
capture the complex temporal dynamics of MEs. Although recent approaches have
adopted video-level regression frameworks to address some of these challenges,
interval decoding still depends on manually predefined, window-based methods,
leaving the issue only partially mitigated. In this paper, we propose a
prior-guided video-level regression method for ME analysis. We introduce a
scalable interval selection strategy that comprehensively considers the
temporal evolution, duration, and class distribution characteristics of MEs,
enabling precise spotting of the onset, apex, and offset phases. In addition,
we introduce a synergistic optimization framework, in which the spotting and
recognition tasks share parameters except for the classification heads. This
fully exploits complementary information, makes more efficient use of limited
data, and enhances the model's capability. Extensive experiments on multiple
benchmark datasets demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of our method,
with an STRS of 0.0562 on CAS(ME)$^3$ and 0.2000 on SAMMLV. The code is

Motivation: 微行网状合术需要高超技能，但现有评估方法依赖主观判断，存在偏差和可靠性问题

Method: 利用三个医院数据集，通过图像处理技术实现对网状合错误的几何建模、检测和评分机制

Result: 几何指标能够有效复现专家评分者对网状合错误的打分

Conclusion: 该量化框架提高了微行外科技能评估的效率和可靠性，推进了培训协议的发展

Abstract: Microsurgical anastomosis demands exceptional dexterity and visuospatial
skills, underscoring the importance of comprehensive training and precise
outcome assessment. Currently, methods such as the outcome-oriented anastomosis
lapse index are used to evaluate this procedure. However, they often rely on
subjective judgment, which can introduce biases that affect the reliability and
efficiency of the assessment of competence. Leveraging three datasets from
hospitals with participants at various levels, we introduce a quantitative
framework that uses image-processing techniques for objective assessment of
microsurgical anastomoses. The approach uses geometric modeling of errors along
with a detection and scoring mechanism, enhancing the efficiency and
reliability of microsurgical proficiency assessment and advancing training
protocols. The results show that the geometric metrics effectively replicate
expert raters' scoring for the errors considered in this work.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的视频稳定方法，通过测试时快速自适应来提升像素级合成视频稳定技术的性能，特别是在高抖动片段进行针对性适应，显著提高了稳定性和视觉质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的像素级合成视频稳定方法虽然能合成全帧输出，但由于视频运动模式和视觉内容的多样性，使用固定参数难以实现鲁棒的泛化性能。

Method: 提出快速自适应方法，利用推理时的低级视觉线索来改进输出；设计了抖动定位模块和针对性适应策略，专注于高抖动片段进行适应，减少适应步骤；保持现代方法的全帧特性同时提供类似经典方法的控制机制。

Result: 在多样化真实世界数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法显著提升了各种全帧合成模型的性能，在定性和定量指标上都有改进，包括在下游应用中的表现。

Conclusion: 该方法能够帮助现代稳定器超越现有SOTA方法，同时保持全帧特性，为用户提供类似经典方法的控制机制，实现了性能的显著提升。

Abstract: Video stabilization remains a fundamental problem in computer vision,
particularly pixel-level synthesis solutions for video stabilization, which
synthesize full-frame outputs, add to the complexity of this task. These
methods aim to enhance stability while synthesizing full-frame videos, but the
inherent diversity in motion profiles and visual content present in each video
sequence makes robust generalization with fixed parameters difficult. To
address this, we present a novel method that improves pixel-level synthesis
video stabilization methods by rapidly adapting models to each input video at
test time. The proposed approach takes advantage of low-level visual cues
available during inference to improve both the stability and visual quality of
the output. Notably, the proposed rapid adaptation achieves significant
performance gains even with a single adaptation pass. We further propose a jerk
localization module and a targeted adaptation strategy, which focuses the
adaptation on high-jerk segments for maximizing stability with fewer adaptation
steps. The proposed methodology enables modern stabilizers to overcome the
longstanding SOTA approaches while maintaining the full frame nature of the
modern methods, while offering users with control mechanisms akin to classical
approaches. Extensive experiments on diverse real-world datasets demonstrate
the versatility of the proposed method. Our approach consistently improves the
performance of various full-frame synthesis models in both qualitative and
quantitative terms, including results on downstream applications.

Motivation: 解决医学诊断中跨群体公平性问题，特别是在成像设备和临床实践变化导致的分布偏移下，现有方法独立处理视觉和文本模态导致残留的跨模态不对齐和公平性差距。

Method: 采用并行双分支架构分离敏感属性和目标属性，构建近似正交文本锚点指导跨注意力机制，使用超网络生成实例感知视觉提示，并应用基于原型的正则化来增强特征分离和对齐。

Result: 在8个医学影像数据集和4种模态上的实验表明，DualFairVL在分布内和分布外设置下均实现了最先进的公平性和准确性，仅使用360万可训练参数就优于全微调和参数高效基线方法。

Conclusion: DualFairVL通过联合去偏和对齐跨模态表示，有效解决了医学影像诊断中的公平性问题，为多模态模型的公平性研究提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Ensuring fairness across demographic groups in medical diagnosis is essential
for equitable healthcare, particularly under distribution shifts caused by
variations in imaging equipment and clinical practice. Vision-language models
(VLMs) exhibit strong generalization, and text prompts encode identity
attributes, enabling explicit identification and removal of sensitive
directions. However, existing debiasing approaches typically address vision and
text modalities independently, leaving residual cross-modal misalignment and
fairness gaps. To address this challenge, we propose DualFairVL, a multimodal
prompt-learning framework that jointly debiases and aligns cross-modal
representations. DualFairVL employs a parallel dual-branch architecture that
separates sensitive and target attributes, enabling disentangled yet aligned
representations across modalities. Approximately orthogonal text anchors are
constructed via linear projections, guiding cross-attention mechanisms to
produce fused features. A hypernetwork further disentangles attribute-related
information and generates instance-aware visual prompts, which encode
dual-modal cues for fairness and robustness. Prototype-based regularization is
applied in the visual branch to enforce separation of sensitive features and
strengthen alignment with textual anchors. Extensive experiments on eight
medical imaging datasets across four modalities show that DualFairVL achieves
state-of-the-art fairness and accuracy under both in- and out-of-distribution
settings, outperforming full fine-tuning and parameter-efficient baselines with
only 3.6M trainable parameters. Code will be released upon publication.

TL;DR: 提出双查询增强网络(DQEN)，通过对象感知编码器特征增强对象查询，利用CLIP模型提取语义特征增强交互查询初始化，在HOI检测任务中取得竞争性性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有DETR-based HOI检测模型使用随机初始化的查询导致表示模糊，限制了模型效果。人类在HOI类别中是固定的，而对象和交互是可变的，需要分别增强对象和交互查询

Method: 1) 使用对象感知编码器特征增强对象查询；2) 设计交互语义融合模块利用CLIP模型提取语义特征增强交互查询初始化；3) 引入辅助预测单元改进交互特征表示

Result: 在HICO-Det和V-COCO数据集上取得了竞争性的性能表现

Conclusion: 提出的双查询增强网络通过分别增强对象和交互查询，有效提升了HOI检测的准确性，证明了明确语义查询的重要性

Abstract: Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection focuses on localizing human-object
pairs and recognizing their interactions. Recently, the DETR-based framework
has been widely adopted in HOI detection. In DETR-based HOI models, queries
with clear meaning are crucial for accurately detecting HOIs. However, prior
works have typically relied on randomly initialized queries, leading to vague
representations that limit the model's effectiveness. Meanwhile, humans in the
HOI categories are fixed, while objects and their interactions are variable.
Therefore, we propose a Dual Query Enhancement Network (DQEN) to enhance object
and interaction queries. Specifically, object queries are enhanced with
object-aware encoder features, enabling the model to focus more effectively on
humans interacting with objects in an object-aware way. On the other hand, we
design a novel Interaction Semantic Fusion module to exploit the HOI candidates
that are promoted by the CLIP model. Semantic features are extracted to enhance
the initialization of interaction queries, thereby improving the model's
ability to understand interactions. Furthermore, we introduce an Auxiliary
Prediction Unit aimed at improving the representation of interaction features.
Our proposed method achieves competitive performance on both the HICO-Det and
the V-COCO datasets. The source code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 端到端自动驾驶模型虽然能直接从原始数据推导控制命令，但其深度神经网络的非线性决策边界使得决策逻辑难以解释，这在复杂城市场景中尤为关键。

Method: 设计特殊的损失函数来促进模型可解释性，生成稀疏和局部化的特征图，通过特征激活来解释图像区域对预测控制命令的贡献。

Result: 在CARLA基准测试中验证了方法的有效性，不仅提高了可解释性，还减少了违规行为，单目非集成模型在CARLA排行榜上取得了最低违规分数和最高路线完成率。

Conclusion: 该方法成功实现了自动驾驶控制命令优化的同时增强可解释性，证明了可解释性与安全性提升的正相关关系，为可信AI在自动驾驶中的部署提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Trustworthy AI is mandatory for the broad deployment of autonomous vehicles.
Although end-to-end approaches derive control commands directly from raw data,
interpreting these decisions remains challenging, especially in complex urban
scenarios. This is mainly attributed to very deep neural networks with
non-linear decision boundaries, making it challenging to grasp the logic behind
AI-driven decisions. This paper presents a method to enhance interpretability
while optimizing control commands in autonomous driving. To address this, we
propose loss functions that promote the interpretability of our model by
generating sparse and localized feature maps. The feature activations allow us
to explain which image regions contribute to the predicted control command. We
conduct comprehensive ablation studies on the feature extraction step and
validate our method on the CARLA benchmarks. We also demonstrate that our
approach improves interpretability, which correlates with reducing infractions,
yielding a safer, high-performance driving model. Notably, our monocular,
non-ensemble model surpasses the top-performing approaches from the CARLA
Leaderboard by achieving lower infraction scores and the highest route
completion rate, all while ensuring interpretability.

Abstract: The Event-Enriched Image Analysis (EVENTA) Grand Challenge, hosted at ACM
Multimedia 2025, introduces the first large-scale benchmark for event-level
multimodal understanding. Traditional captioning and retrieval tasks largely
focus on surface-level recognition of people, objects, and scenes, often
overlooking the contextual and semantic dimensions that define real-world
events. EVENTA addresses this gap by integrating contextual, temporal, and
semantic information to capture the who, when, where, what, and why behind an
image. Built upon the OpenEvents V1 dataset, the challenge features two tracks:
Event-Enriched Image Retrieval and Captioning, and Event-Based Image Retrieval.
A total of 45 teams from six countries participated, with evaluation conducted
through Public and Private Test phases to ensure fairness and reproducibility.
The top three teams were invited to present their solutions at ACM Multimedia
2025. EVENTA establishes a foundation for context-aware, narrative-driven
multimedia AI, with applications in journalism, media analysis, cultural
archiving, and accessibility. Further details about the challenge are available

Conclusion: 本研究为群体行人分析建立了系统框架，未来版本将完成所提指标的完整量化分析及其在人群动力学研究中的应用

Abstract: This study presents an initial framework for distinguishing group and single
pedestrians based on real-world trajectory data, with the aim of analyzing
their differences in space utilization and emergent behavioral patterns. By
segmenting pedestrian trajectories into fixed time bins and applying a
Transformer-based pair classification model, we identify cohesive groups and
isolate single pedestrians over a structured sequence-based filtering process.
To prepare for deeper analysis, we establish a comprehensive metric framework
incorporating both spatial and behavioral dimensions. Spatial utilization
metrics include convex hull area, smallest enclosing circle radius, and
heatmap-based spatial densities to characterize how different pedestrian types
occupy and interact with space. Behavioral metrics such as velocity change,
motion angle deviation, clearance radius, and trajectory straightness are
designed to capture local adaptations and responses during interactions.
Furthermore, we introduce a typology of encounter types-single-to-single,
single-to-group, and group-to-group to categorize and later quantify different
interaction scenarios. Although this version focuses primarily on the
classification pipeline and dataset structuring, it establishes the groundwork
for scalable analysis across different sequence lengths 60, 100, and 200
frames. Future versions will incorporate complete quantitative analysis of the
proposed metrics and their implications for pedestrian simulation and space
design validation in crowd dynamics research.

Abstract: Monitoring coral reefs at large spatial scales remains an open challenge,
essential for assessing ecosystem health and informing conservation efforts.
While drone-based aerial imagery offers broad spatial coverage, its limited
resolution makes it difficult to reliably distinguish fine-scale classes, such
as coral morphotypes. At the same time, obtaining pixel-level annotations over
large spatial extents is costly and labor-intensive, limiting the scalability
of deep learning-based segmentation methods for aerial imagery. We present a
multi-scale weakly supervised semantic segmentation framework that addresses
this challenge by transferring fine-scale ecological information from
underwater imagery to aerial data. Our method enables large-scale coral reef
mapping from drone imagery with minimal manual annotation, combining
classification-based supervision, spatial interpolation and self-distillation
techniques. We demonstrate the efficacy of the approach, enabling large-area
segmentation of coral morphotypes and demonstrating flexibility for integrating
new classes. This study presents a scalable, cost-effective methodology for
high-resolution reef monitoring, combining low-cost data collection, weakly
supervised deep learning and multi-scale remote sensing.

Abstract: Traditional map-making relies heavily on Geographic Information Systems
(GIS), requiring domain expertise and being time-consuming, especially for
repetitive tasks. Recent advances in generative AI (GenAI), particularly image
diffusion models, offer new opportunities for automating and democratizing the
map-making process. However, these models struggle with accurate map creation
due to limited control over spatial composition and semantic layout. To address
this, we integrate vector data to guide map generation in different styles,
specified by the textual prompts. Our model is the first to generate accurate
maps in controlled styles, and we have integrated it into a web application to
improve its usability and accessibility. We conducted a user study with
professional cartographers to assess the fidelity of generated maps, the
usability of the web application, and the implications of ever-emerging GenAI
in map-making. The findings have suggested the potential of our developed
application and, more generally, the GenAI models in helping both non-expert
users and professionals in creating maps more efficiently. We have also
outlined further technical improvements and emphasized the new role of
cartographers to advance the paradigm of AI-assisted map-making.

Motivation: 现有方法将风格驱动和主体驱动生成视为两个独立任务，存在明显对立性。作者认为两者本质都是内容与风格的解耦和重组，应该统一处理

Method: 1)构建大规模三元组数据集；2)引入解耦学习方案，通过风格对齐训练和内容-风格解耦训练同时对齐风格特征并分离内容；3)加入风格奖励学习(SRL)进一步提升性能；4)发布首个联合评估基准USO-Bench

Result: USO在开源模型中实现了最先进的性能，在主体一致性和风格相似性两个维度上都表现出色

Conclusion: USO成功统一了风格驱动和主体驱动的定制化生成任务，证明了通过内容-风格解耦和重组可以实现两者的协同优化

Abstract: Existing literature typically treats style-driven and subject-driven
generation as two disjoint tasks: the former prioritizes stylistic similarity,
whereas the latter insists on subject consistency, resulting in an apparent
antagonism. We argue that both objectives can be unified under a single
framework because they ultimately concern the disentanglement and
re-composition of content and style, a long-standing theme in style-driven
research. To this end, we present USO, a Unified Style-Subject Optimized
customization model. First, we construct a large-scale triplet dataset
consisting of content images, style images, and their corresponding stylized
content images. Second, we introduce a disentangled learning scheme that
simultaneously aligns style features and disentangles content from style
through two complementary objectives, style-alignment training and
content-style disentanglement training. Third, we incorporate a style
reward-learning paradigm denoted as SRL to further enhance the model's
performance. Finally, we release USO-Bench, the first benchmark that jointly
evaluates style similarity and subject fidelity across multiple metrics.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that USO achieves state-of-the-art
performance among open-source models along both dimensions of subject
consistency and style similarity. Code and model:

Motivation: 传统NeRF方法在视觉定位中会编码精细场景细节，存在隐私泄露风险，特别是在云服务部署时敏感信息可能被恢复。

Method: 提出ppNeRF（隐私保护神经分割场），使用自监督学习的分割标签而非RGB图像进行训练，分割标签足够粗糙以隐藏可识别细节，同时在3D空间中保持判别性。

Result: ppNeSF在视觉定位任务中达到了最先进的性能，同时有效保护了隐私。

Conclusion: 通过分割监督训练NeRF可以有效解决隐私保护问题，为云基视觉定位服务提供了安全的解决方案。

Abstract: Visual localization (VL) is the task of estimating the camera pose in a known
scene. VL methods, a.o., can be distinguished based on how they represent the
scene, e.g., explicitly through a (sparse) point cloud or a collection of
images or implicitly through the weights of a neural network. Recently,
NeRF-based methods have become popular for VL. While NeRFs offer high-quality
novel view synthesis, they inadvertently encode fine scene details, raising
privacy concerns when deployed in cloud-based localization services as
sensitive information could be recovered. In this paper, we tackle this
challenge on two ends. We first propose a new protocol to assess
privacy-preservation of NeRF-based representations. We show that NeRFs trained
with photometric losses store fine-grained details in their geometry
representations, making them vulnerable to privacy attacks, even if the head
that predicts colors is removed. Second, we propose ppNeSF (Privacy-Preserving
Neural Segmentation Field), a NeRF variant trained with segmentation
supervision instead of RGB images. These segmentation labels are learned in a
self-supervised manner, ensuring they are coarse enough to obscure identifiable
scene details while remaining discriminativeness in 3D. The segmentation space
of ppNeSF can be used for accurate visual localization, yielding
state-of-the-art results.

Method: 采用两种检索变体：基于OCR令牌的文本检索和无需OCR的纯视觉检索，在多个模型和基准测试上进行系统评估，包括MP-DocVQA、DUDE和InfographicVQA数据集。

Result: 文本中心变体比"拼接所有页面"基线提升高达+22.5 ANLS，视觉变体无需文本提取即可实现+5.0 ANLS改进。检索和重排序组件是性能提升的主要驱动力。

Conclusion: 仔细的证据选择能够持续提升多页文档VQA的准确性，证明了其在现实应用中的实用价值，而布局引导的分块策略在这些数据集上未能提供帮助。

Abstract: Document Visual Question Answering (Document VQA) must cope with documents
that span dozens of pages, yet leading systems still concatenate every page or
rely on very large vision-language models, both of which are memory-hungry.
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) offers an attractive alternative, first
retrieving a concise set of relevant segments before generating answers from
this selected evidence. In this paper, we systematically evaluate the impact of
incorporating RAG into Document VQA through different retrieval variants -
text-based retrieval using OCR tokens and purely visual retrieval without OCR -
across multiple models and benchmarks. Evaluated on the multi-page datasets
MP-DocVQA, DUDE, and InfographicVQA, the text-centric variant improves the
"concatenate-all-pages" baseline by up to +22.5 ANLS, while the visual variant
achieves +5.0 ANLS improvement without requiring any text extraction. An
ablation confirms that retrieval and reranking components drive most of the
gain, whereas the layout-guided chunking strategy - proposed in several recent
works to leverage page structure - fails to help on these datasets. Our
experiments demonstrate that careful evidence selection consistently boosts
accuracy across multiple model sizes and multi-page benchmarks, underscoring
its practical value for real-world Document VQA.

### [54] [Ask Me Again Differently: GRAS for Measuring Bias in Vision Language Models on Gender, Race, Age, and Skin Tone](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18989)
*Shaivi Malik,Hasnat Md Abdullah,Sriparna Saha,Amit Sheth*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GRAS是一个用于评估视觉语言模型(VLMs)人口统计偏见的基准测试，涵盖性别、种族、年龄和肤色等多个维度，并提出了可解释的GRAS偏见评分指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着视觉语言模型在现实应用中的普及，理解其人口统计偏见变得至关重要，需要系统性的评估方法来量化这些偏见。

Method: 提出了GRAS基准测试，包含最全面的人口统计多样性覆盖，并设计了GRAS偏见评分这一可解释的量化指标，对5个最先进的VLM模型进行了评估。

Result: 评估结果显示所有模型都存在严重的偏见问题，表现最好的模型GRAS偏见评分仅为2分（满分100分），同时发现VQA偏见评估需要考虑问题的多种表述方式。

Conclusion: GRAS基准测试揭示了当前VLM模型中普遍存在的人口统计偏见问题，强调了多问题表述评估的重要性，为未来偏见缓解研究提供了重要基础。

Abstract: As Vision Language Models (VLMs) become integral to real-world applications,
understanding their demographic biases is critical. We introduce GRAS, a
benchmark for uncovering demographic biases in VLMs across gender, race, age,
and skin tone, offering the most diverse coverage to date. We further propose
the GRAS Bias Score, an interpretable metric for quantifying bias. We benchmark
five state-of-the-art VLMs and reveal concerning bias levels, with the least
biased model attaining a GRAS Bias Score of only 2 out of 100. Our findings
also reveal a methodological insight: evaluating bias in VLMs with visual
question answering (VQA) requires considering multiple formulations of a
question. Our code, data, and evaluation results are publicly available.

*Siyuan You,Guozheng Xu,Pengwei Zhou,Qiwen Jin,Jian Yao,Li Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出RoofSeg网络，基于Transformer编码器-解码器框架，通过可学习平面查询实现端到端的屋顶平面分割，解决了现有深度学习方法在边缘精度和几何约束方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于深度学习的屋顶平面分割方法存在三个问题：非真正端到端导致结果非最优、边缘区域特征判别性低导致边缘不准确、平面几何特征约束不足。

Method: 开发RoofSeg网络，采用Transformer编码器-解码器框架，使用可学习平面查询预测平面实例掩码；设计边缘感知掩码模块(EAMM)融入平面几何先验；提出自适应权重策略和平面几何损失函数。

Result: 该方法实现了真正端到端的屋顶平面分割，提高了边缘区域的判别性和分割精度，通过几何约束优化了网络训练。

Conclusion: RoofSeg网络有效解决了当前深度学习方法在屋顶平面分割中的三个关键问题，为从LiDAR点云重建LoD 2和3级3D建筑模型提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: Roof plane segmentation is one of the key procedures for reconstructing
three-dimensional (3D) building models at levels of detail (LoD) 2 and 3 from
airborne light detection and ranging (LiDAR) point clouds. The majority of
current approaches for roof plane segmentation rely on the manually designed or
learned features followed by some specifically designed geometric clustering
strategies. Because the learned features are more powerful than the manually
designed features, the deep learning-based approaches usually perform better
than the traditional approaches. However, the current deep learning-based
approaches have three unsolved problems. The first is that most of them are not
truly end-to-end, the plane segmentation results may be not optimal. The second
is that the point feature discriminability near the edges is relatively low,
leading to inaccurate planar edges. The third is that the planar geometric
characteristics are not sufficiently considered to constrain the network
training. To solve these issues, a novel edge-aware transformer-based network,
named RoofSeg, is developed for segmenting roof planes from LiDAR point clouds
in a truly end-to-end manner. In the RoofSeg, we leverage a transformer
encoder-decoder-based framework to hierarchically predict the plane instance
masks with the use of a set of learnable plane queries. To further improve the
segmentation accuracy of edge regions, we also design an Edge-Aware Mask Module
(EAMM) that sufficiently incorporates planar geometric prior of edges to
enhance its discriminability for plane instance mask refinement. In addition,
we propose an adaptive weighting strategy in the mask loss to reduce the
influence of misclassified points, and also propose a new plane geometric loss
to constrain the network training.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出MicroDetect-Net深度学习模型，结合荧光显微镜和尼罗红染色技术，用于检测血液样本中的微塑料污染，准确率达到92%


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着全球塑料污染日益严重，微塑料已广泛存在于环境及生物体中，对人体健康造成潜在危害，需要开发有效的检测方法

Method: 使用尼罗红染料染色和荧光显微镜技术，结合卷积神经网络进行图像分割和微塑料定位计数

Result: 在276张尼罗红染色荧光血液图像数据集上，模型达到92%准确率，IoU为87.4%，F1分数92.1%，精确率90.6%，召回率93.7%

Conclusion: MDN模型在微塑料检测方面表现出色，为后续应用于人类血液样本的微塑料检测提供了有效技术路径

Abstract: With the prevalence of plastics exceeding 368 million tons yearly,
microplastic pollution has grown to an extent where air, water, soil, and
living organisms have all tested positive for microplastic presence. These
particles, which are smaller than 5 millimeters in size, are no less harmful to
humans than to the environment. Toxicity research on microplastics has shown
that exposure may cause liver infection, intestinal injuries, and gut flora
imbalance, leading to numerous potential health hazards. This paper presents a
new model, MicroDetect-Net (MDN), which applies fluorescence microscopy with
Nile Red dye staining and deep learning to scan blood samples for
microplastics. Although clam blood has certain limitations in replicating real
human blood, this study opens avenues for applying the approach to human
samples, which are more consistent for preliminary data collection. The MDN
model integrates dataset preparation, fluorescence imaging, and segmentation
using a convolutional neural network to localize and count microplastic
fragments. The combination of convolutional networks and Nile Red dye for
segmentation produced strong image detection and accuracy. MDN was evaluated on
a dataset of 276 Nile Red-stained fluorescent blood images and achieved an
accuracy of ninety two percent. Robust performance was observed with an
Intersection over Union of 87.4 percent, F1 score of 92.1 percent, Precision of
90.6 percent, and Recall of 93.7 percent. These metrics demonstrate the
effectiveness of MDN in the detection of microplastics.

TL;DR: ProPy是一个基于CLIP的模型，通过提示金字塔结构和祖先-后代交互机制，在部分相关视频检索任务中实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 部分相关视频检索(PRVR)是一个实用但具有挑战性的任务，现有方法主要处理单模态特征，而强大的预训练视觉-语言模型如CLIP在该领域尚未得到充分探索。

Method: 提出了ProPy模型，包含两个关键创新：(1)提示金字塔结构，组织事件提示以捕获多粒度语义；(2)祖先-后代交互机制，实现事件间的动态语义交互。

Result: 在三个公共数据集上实现了最先进的性能，显著超越了之前的模型。

Conclusion: ProPy通过系统性的架构适配，成功将CLIP应用于PRVR任务，证明了多粒度事件语义建模的有效性。

Abstract: Partially Relevant Video Retrieval (PRVR) is a practical yet challenging task
that involves retrieving videos based on queries relevant to only specific
segments. While existing works follow the paradigm of developing models to
process unimodal features, powerful pretrained vision-language models like CLIP
remain underexplored in this field. To bridge this gap, we propose ProPy, a
model with systematic architectural adaption of CLIP specifically designed for
PRVR. Drawing insights from the semantic relevance of multi-granularity events,
ProPy introduces two key innovations: (1) A Prompt Pyramid structure that
organizes event prompts to capture semantics at multiple granularity levels,
and (2) An Ancestor-Descendant Interaction Mechanism built on the pyramid that
enables dynamic semantic interaction among events. With these designs, ProPy
achieves SOTA performance on three public datasets, outperforming previous
models by significant margins. Code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究利用自监督预训练和基础模型，通过大规模几何动脉模型数据集（8449个形状）来改善冠状动脉壁剪切应力评估，解决了医学影像数据稀缺的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在心血管健康等领域，利用大数据进行患者护理具有巨大潜力，但收集足够大的数据集来有效训练机器学习模型极具挑战性。特别是在冠状动脉领域，如何利用学习到的表征来改善血流动力学生物标志物评估尚未得到充分研究。

Method: 使用包含8449个3D血管几何模型的大规模数据集，通过计算热核签名（基于拉普拉斯特征向量获得的量）创建自监督目标，捕获形状的本质特征。然后将学习到的几何表征应用于小规模临床试验数据（49名患者）的壁剪切应力评估。

Result: 研究表明，从大规模数据集中学习到的几何表征能够显著提升冠状动脉分割为低、中、高（时间平均）壁剪切应力区域的性能，即使在有限数据条件下训练也能获得良好效果。

Conclusion: 通过自监督预训练和基础模型方法，可以利用大规模几何数据集来有效解决医学影像数据稀缺问题，为冠状动脉血流动力学生物标志物评估提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Leveraging big data for patient care is promising in many medical fields such
as cardiovascular health. For example, hemodynamic biomarkers like wall shear
stress could be assessed from patient-specific medical images via machine
learning algorithms, bypassing the need for time-intensive computational fluid
simulation. However, it is extremely challenging to amass large-enough datasets
to effectively train such models. We could address this data scarcity by means
of self-supervised pre-training and foundations models given large datasets of
geometric artery models. In the context of coronary arteries, leveraging
learned representations to improve hemodynamic biomarker assessment has not yet
been well studied. In this work, we address this gap by investigating whether a
large dataset (8449 shapes) consisting of geometric models of 3D blood vessels
can benefit wall shear stress assessment in coronary artery models from a
small-scale clinical trial (49 patients). We create a self-supervised target
for the 3D blood vessels by computing the heat kernel signature, a quantity
obtained via Laplacian eigenvectors, which captures the very essence of the
shapes. We show how geometric representations learned from this datasets can
boost segmentation of coronary arteries into regions of low, mid and high
(time-averaged) wall shear stress even when trained on limited data.

TL;DR: SuperSimpleNet是一个高效的自适应表面缺陷检测模型，能够在无监督、弱监督、混合监督和全监督四种场景下统一训练，在多个基准数据集上达到最先进性能，推理时间低于10毫秒。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有表面缺陷检测方法往往局限于特定监督场景，难以适应工业制造中多样化的数据标注需求，无法同时满足高性能、高效率和强适应性的工业要求。

Method: 基于SimpleNet构建，引入新颖的合成异常生成过程、增强的分类头和改进的学习过程，能够在所有四种监督场景下进行高效训练。

Result: 在四个具有挑战性的基准数据集上均达到最先进性能，推理时间低于10毫秒，是首个能够充分利用所有可用数据标注的模型。

Conclusion: SuperSimpleNet通过统一多样化监督范式，在保持出色速度和可靠性的同时，为解决实际制造挑战和弥合学术研究与工业应用之间的差距迈出了重要一步。

Abstract: Surface defect detection is a critical task across numerous industries, aimed
at efficiently identifying and localising imperfections or irregularities on
manufactured components. While numerous methods have been proposed, many fail
to meet industrial demands for high performance, efficiency, and adaptability.
Existing approaches are often constrained to specific supervision scenarios and
struggle to adapt to the diverse data annotations encountered in real-world
manufacturing processes, such as unsupervised, weakly supervised, mixed
supervision, and fully supervised settings. To address these challenges, we
propose SuperSimpleNet, a highly efficient and adaptable discriminative model
built on the foundation of SimpleNet. SuperSimpleNet incorporates a novel
synthetic anomaly generation process, an enhanced classification head, and an
improved learning procedure, enabling efficient training in all four
supervision scenarios, making it the first model capable of fully leveraging
all available data annotations. SuperSimpleNet sets a new standard for
performance across all scenarios, as demonstrated by its results on four
challenging benchmark datasets. Beyond accuracy, it is very fast, achieving an
inference time below 10 ms. With its ability to unify diverse supervision
paradigms while maintaining outstanding speed and reliability, SuperSimpleNet
represents a promising step forward in addressing real-world manufacturing
challenges and bridging the gap between academic research and industrial
applications. Code: https://github.com/blaz-r/SuperSimpleNet

Abstract: Single-Pixel Imaging enables reconstructing objects using a single detector
through sequential illuminations with structured light patterns. We propose a
bilevel optimisation method for learning task-specific, binary illumination
patterns, optimised for applications like single-pixel fluorescence microscopy.
We address the non-differentiable nature of binary pattern optimisation using
the Straight-Through Estimator and leveraging a Total Deep Variation
regulariser in the bilevel formulation. We demonstrate our method on the
CytoImageNet microscopy dataset and show that learned patterns achieve superior
reconstruction performance compared to baseline methods, especially in highly
undersampled regimes.

TL;DR: 通过旋转不平衡质量产生周期性振动，解决固定照明和静态场景下事件相机无法产生事件的问题，结合运动补偿管线获得清洁的运动缩正事件。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 事件相机在固定照明和静态/低运动场景下无法产生事件，限制了在计算机视觉任务中的应用。现有运动激发方法需要复杂硬件或额外光学组件。

Method: 使用简单旋转不平衡质量产生周期性振动，结合运动补偿管线去除注入的运动，获得清洁的运动缩正事件。

Result: 在实际采集的数据集上验证，方法可靠地恢复运动参数，在图像重建和边缘检测任务上都比无运动激发的事件感知更好。

Conclusion: 该轻量级方法通过简单的振动机制有效解决了事件相机在静态场景下的限制，为下游感知任务提供了更好的事件数据。

Abstract: Event cameras are a bio-inspired class of sensors that asynchronously measure
per-pixel intensity changes. Under fixed illumination conditions in static or
low-motion scenes, rigidly mounted event cameras are unable to generate any
events, becoming unsuitable for most computer vision tasks. To address this
limitation, recent work has investigated motion-induced event stimulation that
often requires complex hardware or additional optical components. In contrast,
we introduce a lightweight approach to sustain persistent event generation by
employing a simple rotating unbalanced mass to induce periodic vibrational
motion. This is combined with a motion-compensation pipeline that removes the
injected motion and yields clean, motion-corrected events for downstream
perception tasks. We demonstrate our approach with a hardware prototype and
evaluate it on real-world captured datasets. Our method reliably recovers
motion parameters and improves both image reconstruction and edge detection
over event-based sensing without motion induction.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种采用轻量级UNet++结构和拓扑感知损失函数的少样本学习方法，在历史文档文本行分割任务中实现了更高的准确性和数据效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 历史文档的文本行分割需要大量注释数据，但注释过程苦难且需要专业知识，因此需要少样本学习方法来降低数据需求。

Method: 结合轻量级UNet++网络和专门为神经元形态设计的连通性感知损失函数，明确惩罚线段碎片化和错误合并等结构错误。仅从每个手稿中提取三页注释页面进行小片段训练。

Result: 在U-DIADS-TL数据集上显著提升了识别准确性（200%增长）和线交叉比（75%增长），在DIVA-HisDB基准检测任务中达到或超过竞赛胜者的F-Measure分数，仅需三页注释数据。

Conclusion: 小型简单的网络结构配合拓扑感知损失函数能够在历史文档文本行分割任务中实现更高的准确性和数据效率，为少样本学习提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: A foundational task for the digital analysis of documents is text line
segmentation. However, automating this process with deep learning models is
challenging because it requires large, annotated datasets that are often
unavailable for historical documents. Additionally, the annotation process is a
labor- and cost-intensive task that requires expert knowledge, which makes
few-shot learning a promising direction for reducing data requirements. In this
work, we demonstrate that small and simple architectures, coupled with a
topology-aware loss function, are more accurate and data-efficient than more
complex alternatives. We pair a lightweight UNet++ with a connectivity-aware
loss, initially developed for neuron morphology, which explicitly penalizes
structural errors like line fragmentation and unintended line merges. To
increase our limited data, we train on small patches extracted from a mere
three annotated pages per manuscript. Our methodology significantly improves
upon the current state-of-the-art on the U-DIADS-TL dataset, with a 200%
increase in Recognition Accuracy and a 75% increase in Line Intersection over
Union. Our method also achieves an F-Measure score on par with or even
exceeding that of the competition winner of the DIVA-HisDB baseline detection
task, all while requiring only three annotated pages, exemplifying the efficacy
of our approach. Our implementation is publicly available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 发现文本嵌入对数值大小敏感但忽略测量单位，导致即使物理长度相同但单位不同时性能严重下降，这暴露了预训练语言模型在3D理解方面的弱点

Method: 提出两种方法：1) 3DTE预处理方法通过增强文本查询中距离描述符的多样性来改善不同单位间的映射关系理解；2) TGE模块将基础文本特征投影到几何一致空间，用3D增强的文本特征精确引导几何特征的注意力

Result: 在Mono3DRefer数据集上取得显著改进，在"Far"场景中准确率提升11.94%，达到新的最先进水平

Conclusion: 通过增强文本嵌入的3D感知能力和几何特征，有效解决了数值单位敏感性问题，显著提升了单目3D视觉定位任务的性能

Abstract: Monocular 3D visual grounding is a novel task that aims to locate 3D objects
in RGB images using text descriptions with explicit geometry information.
Despite the inclusion of geometry details in the text, we observe that the text
embeddings are sensitive to the magnitude of numerical values but largely
ignore the associated measurement units. For example, simply equidistant
mapping the length with unit "meter" to "decimeters" or "centimeters" leads to
severe performance degradation, even though the physical length remains
equivalent. This observation signifies the weak 3D comprehension of pre-trained
language model, which generates misguiding text features to hinder 3D
perception. Therefore, we propose to enhance the 3D perception of model on text
embeddings and geometry features with two simple and effective methods.
Firstly, we introduce a pre-processing method named 3D-text Enhancement (3DTE),
which enhances the comprehension of mapping relationships between different
units by augmenting the diversity of distance descriptors in text queries.
Next, we propose a Text-Guided Geometry Enhancement (TGE) module to further
enhance the 3D-text information by projecting the basic text features into
geometrically consistent space. These 3D-enhanced text features are then
leveraged to precisely guide the attention of geometry features. We evaluate
the proposed method through extensive comparisons and ablation studies on the
Mono3DRefer dataset. Experimental results demonstrate substantial improvements
over previous methods, achieving new state-of-the-art results with a notable
accuracy gain of 11.94\% in the "Far" scenario. Our code will be made publicly
available.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了WEF-PE位置编码方法，使用椭圆函数在复数域中直接编码二维坐标，解决了传统位置编码缺乏几何约束的问题，在多个视觉任务上取得了优异性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Vision Transformer使用一维位置编码会破坏图像的二维空间结构，缺乏几何约束，无法建立欧几里得空间距离与序列索引距离之间的单调对应关系，限制了模型利用空间邻近先验的能力。

Method: 提出Weierstrass椭圆函数位置编码(WEF-PE)，利用椭圆函数的双周期性质与视觉数据的平移不变性模式对齐，通过复数域表示直接处理二维坐标，利用椭圆函数的非线性几何性质自然编码空间距离关系。

Result: 在多个实验中表现优异：ViT-Tiny在CIFAR-100从头训练达到63.78%准确率，ViT-Base在CIFAR-100微调达到93.28%，在VTAB-1k基准任务上持续改进。理论分析证实了距离衰减特性，注意力可视化显示增强了几何归纳偏置。

Conclusion: WEF-PE是一种数学原理严谨的位置编码方法，能够有效编码二维空间关系，提升Vision Transformer在视觉任务中的性能，具有更好的几何归纳偏置和语义聚焦能力。

Abstract: Vision Transformers have demonstrated remarkable success in computer vision
tasks, yet their reliance on learnable one-dimensional positional embeddings
fundamentally disrupts the inherent two-dimensional spatial structure of images
through patch flattening procedures. Traditional positional encoding approaches
lack geometric constraints and fail to establish monotonic correspondence
between Euclidean spatial distances and sequential index distances, thereby
limiting the model's capacity to leverage spatial proximity priors effectively.
We propose Weierstrass Elliptic Function Positional Encoding (WEF-PE), a
mathematically principled approach that directly addresses two-dimensional
coordinates through natural complex domain representation, where the doubly
periodic properties of elliptic functions align remarkably with translational
invariance patterns commonly observed in visual data. Our method exploits the
non-linear geometric nature of elliptic functions to encode spatial distance
relationships naturally, while the algebraic addition formula enables direct
derivation of relative positional information between arbitrary patch pairs
from their absolute encodings. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that
WEF-PE achieves superior performance across diverse scenarios, including
63.78\% accuracy on CIFAR-100 from-scratch training with ViT-Tiny architecture,
93.28\% on CIFAR-100 fine-tuning with ViT-Base, and consistent improvements on
VTAB-1k benchmark tasks. Theoretical analysis confirms the distance-decay
property through rigorous mathematical proof, while attention visualization
reveals enhanced geometric inductive bias and more coherent semantic focus
compared to conventional approaches.The source code implementing the methods
described in this paper is publicly available on GitHub.

*Jeonghwan Kim,Yushi Lan,Armando Fortes,Yongwei Chen,Xingang Pan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 通过分离生成顶点和面片，减少网格生成的代序冗余，实现8倍速度提升和更高网格质量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有网格生成方法将三角网格转换为代序列时，因为顶点被多个面共享而导致代序冗余和序列过长，生成效率低下

Method: 使用自回归模型生成顶点，只需约23%的代序数量；用双向Transformer捕捉顶点关系并一步完成面片构建；加入保真增强器精细化顶点位置，通过后处理移除不良边缘连接

Result: 网格生成速度比最先进方法提升超过8倍，同时产生更高质量的网格

Conclusion: 分离顶点和面片生成的框架有效减少了网格表示的冗余，实现了更高效和更高质量的艺术网格生成

Abstract: Recent mesh generation approaches typically tokenize triangle meshes into
sequences of tokens and train autoregressive models to generate these tokens
sequentially. Despite substantial progress, such token sequences inevitably
reuse vertices multiple times to fully represent manifold meshes, as each
vertex is shared by multiple faces. This redundancy leads to excessively long
token sequences and inefficient generation processes. In this paper, we propose
an efficient framework that generates artistic meshes by treating vertices and
faces separately, significantly reducing redundancy. We employ an
autoregressive model solely for vertex generation, decreasing the token count
to approximately 23\% of that required by the most compact existing tokenizer.
Next, we leverage a bidirectional transformer to complete the mesh in a single
step by capturing inter-vertex relationships and constructing the adjacency
matrix that defines the mesh faces. To further improve the generation quality,
we introduce a fidelity enhancer to refine vertex positioning into more natural
arrangements and propose a post-processing framework to remove undesirable edge
connections. Experimental results show that our method achieves more than
8$\times$ faster speed on mesh generation compared to state-of-the-art
approaches, while producing higher mesh quality.

### [67] [All-in-One Slider for Attribute Manipulation in Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19195)
*Weixin Ye,Hongguang Zhu,Wei Wang,Yahui Liu,Mengyu Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一个轻量级的All-in-One Slider模块，通过将文本嵌入空间分解为稀疏的语义属性方向，实现了多个属性的细粒度连续控制，充分解决了以往方法的参数冗余和扩展性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的T2I模型在进行图像属性精细操控时面临挑战，特别是对人脸等细节丰富的内容。以往的One-for-One方式需要为每个属性训练独立滑块，导致参数冗余和扩展性不足。

Method: 设计了All-in-One Slider轻量级模块，将文本嵌入空间分解为稀疏的语义属性方向。该模块一次训练后即可作为通用滑块使用，支持多属性细粒度控制、未见属性零样本操控以及多属性组合。

Result: 实验结果显示，该方法能够实现准确且可扩展的属性操控，较以往方法有显著提升。同时可以与逆向框架集成，对真实图像进行属性操控，扩大了应用范围。

Conclusion: All-in-One Slider方案有效解决了现有方法的参数冗余和扩展性问题，实现了多属性细粒度控制，并支持零样本操控和属性组合，为实际应用提供了更高的灵活性和可扩展性。

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have made significant strides in
generating high-quality images. However, progressively manipulating certain
attributes of generated images to meet the desired user expectations remains
challenging, particularly for content with rich details, such as human faces.
Some studies have attempted to address this by training slider modules.
However, they follow a One-for-One manner, where an independent slider is
trained for each attribute, requiring additional training whenever a new
attribute is introduced. This not only results in parameter redundancy
accumulated by sliders but also restricts the flexibility of practical
applications and the scalability of attribute manipulation. To address this
issue, we introduce the All-in-One Slider, a lightweight module that decomposes
the text embedding space into sparse, semantically meaningful attribute
directions. Once trained, it functions as a general-purpose slider, enabling
interpretable and fine-grained continuous control over various attributes.
Moreover, by recombining the learned directions, the All-in-One Slider supports
zero-shot manipulation of unseen attributes (e.g., races and celebrities) and
the composition of multiple attributes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our method enables accurate and scalable attribute manipulation, achieving
notable improvements compared to previous methods. Furthermore, our method can
be extended to integrate with the inversion framework to perform attribute
manipulation on real images, broadening its applicability to various real-world
scenarios. The code and trained model will be released at:

TL;DR: 一种新的方法，通过结合代理几何生成和从2D图像前矢中识别分散分数，直接生成大规模3D驾驶场景，提供准确的几何基础和因果关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的神经重建方法受限于静态环境和抓取数据的多样性，而图像/视频生成模型缺乏几何基础和因果性。需要找到一种方法来突破这些限制。

Method: 结合代理几何生成和环境表示，使用学习到的2D图像前矢进行分数识别。可以基于地图布局来条件化生成。

Result: 能够生成高可控性、高保真度的结构和纹理，产生现实且几何一致的复杂驾驶场景3D生成。

Conclusion: 该方法成功地缩小了现有重建方法和生成方法之间的差距，提供了既具备准确几何基础又具有高可控性的大规模3D场景生成能力。

Abstract: Large-scale scene data is essential for training and testing in robot
learning. Neural reconstruction methods have promised the capability of
reconstructing large physically-grounded outdoor scenes from captured sensor
data. However, these methods have baked-in static environments and only allow
for limited scene control -- they are functionally constrained in scene and
trajectory diversity by the captures from which they are reconstructed. In
contrast, generating driving data with recent image or video diffusion models
offers control, however, at the cost of geometry grounding and causality. In
this work, we aim to bridge this gap and present a method that directly
generates large-scale 3D driving scenes with accurate geometry, allowing for
causal novel view synthesis with object permanence and explicit 3D geometry
estimation. The proposed method combines the generation of a proxy geometry and
environment representation with score distillation from learned 2D image
priors. We find that this approach allows for high controllability, enabling
the prompt-guided geometry and high-fidelity texture and structure that can be
conditioned on map layouts -- producing realistic and geometrically consistent
3D generations of complex driving scenes.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了OmniHuman-1.5框架，通过多模态大语言模型和专门的多模态DiT架构，生成既具复杂物理可行性又有深层语义一致性的角色动画。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频虚拟人物模型虽能生成流畅的人物动画，但无法抓住角色的真实本质，动作仅同步低级音频节奏，缺乏对情感、意图和上下文的深层语义理解。

Method: 使用多模态大语言模型合成结构化文本表示来提供高级语义指导；提出专门的多模态DiT架构与伪最后帧设计，减少模态间冲突。

Result: 模型在唇形同步准确性、视频质量、动作自然性和文本提示语义一致性等综合指标上达到领先表现，并能扩展到多人和非人物复杂场景。

Conclusion: OmniHuman-1.5通过深层语义理解和多模态融合，能够生成既物理可行又语义丰富的角色动画，为视频虚拟人物生成领域带来重要进步。

Abstract: Existing video avatar models can produce fluid human animations, yet they
struggle to move beyond mere physical likeness to capture a character's
authentic essence. Their motions typically synchronize with low-level cues like
audio rhythm, lacking a deeper semantic understanding of emotion, intent, or
context. To bridge this gap, \textbf{we propose a framework designed to
generate character animations that are not only physically plausible but also
semantically coherent and expressive.} Our model, \textbf{OmniHuman-1.5}, is
built upon two key technical contributions. First, we leverage Multimodal Large
Language Models to synthesize a structured textual representation of conditions
that provides high-level semantic guidance. This guidance steers our motion
generator beyond simplistic rhythmic synchronization, enabling the production
of actions that are contextually and emotionally resonant. Second, to ensure
the effective fusion of these multimodal inputs and mitigate inter-modality
conflicts, we introduce a specialized Multimodal DiT architecture with a novel
Pseudo Last Frame design. The synergy of these components allows our model to
accurately interpret the joint semantics of audio, images, and text, thereby
generating motions that are deeply coherent with the character, scene, and
linguistic content. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model achieves
leading performance across a comprehensive set of metrics, including lip-sync
accuracy, video quality, motion naturalness and semantic consistency with
textual prompts. Furthermore, our approach shows remarkable extensibility to
complex scenarios, such as those involving multi-person and non-human subjects.

TL;DR: VFTrack是一个实时原位粒子跟踪框架，用于自动检测和跟踪SEM图像序列中的碳纳米管粒子，解决了现有方法只能静态分析或缺乏连续轨迹分解的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 碳纳米管动态生长的表征受到扫描电子显微镜成像中纳米级运动测量实验挑战的限制，现有方法要么只能静态分析，要么需要手动初始化且缺乏连续的单粒子轨迹分解。

Method: VFTrack将手工或深度特征检测器和匹配器集成到粒子跟踪框架中，使用ALIKED检测器和LightGlue匹配器作为最优组合，能够对碳纳米管微柱生长进行运动学分析。

Result: 在13,540条手动标注轨迹的系统评估中，最佳组合达到F1分数0.78和α分数0.89。VFTrack能够将运动矢量分解为轴向生长、横向漂移和振荡，计算异质区域生长速率并重建演化的CNT柱形态。

Conclusion: 这项工作推动了自动化纳米材料表征的发展，弥合了基于物理的模型与实验观察之间的差距，实现了碳纳米管合成的实时优化。

Abstract: Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are critical building blocks in nanotechnology, yet
the characterization of their dynamic growth is limited by the experimental
challenges in nanoscale motion measurement using scanning electron microscopy
(SEM) imaging. Existing ex situ methods offer only static analysis, while in
situ techniques often require manual initialization and lack continuous
per-particle trajectory decomposition. We present Visual Feature Tracking
(VFTrack) an in-situ real-time particle tracking framework that automatically
detects and tracks individual CNT particles in SEM image sequences. VFTrack
integrates handcrafted or deep feature detectors and matchers within a particle
tracking framework to enable kinematic analysis of CNT micropillar growth. A
systematic using 13,540 manually annotated trajectories identifies the ALIKED
detector with LightGlue matcher as an optimal combination (F1-score of 0.78,
$\alpha$-score of 0.89). VFTrack motion vectors decomposed into axial growth,
lateral drift, and oscillations, facilitate the calculation of heterogeneous
regional growth rates and the reconstruction of evolving CNT pillar
morphologies. This work enables advancement in automated nano-material
characterization, bridging the gap between physics-based models and
experimental observation to enable real-time optimization of CNT synthesis.

TL;DR: AUSM是一个基于状态空间模型的统一架构，将视频分割重新构建为序列掩码预测，同时支持提示式和无提示视频分割，在多个基准测试中表现优异且训练速度提升2.5倍


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视频分割领域存在碎片化问题，提示式分割模型（如SAM2）和无提示分割需要不同的专用模型，缺乏统一的解决方案来处理流式视频分割任务

Method: 将流式视频分割重新构建为序列掩码预测问题，类似于语言建模。基于状态空间模型构建AUSM架构，维护固定大小的空间状态，支持任意长度视频流，所有组件都设计为跨帧并行训练

Result: 在DAVIS17、YouTube-VOS、MOSE、YouTube-VIS、OVIS等多个标准基准测试中优于先前的通用流式视频分割方法，在16帧序列上实现高达2.5倍的训练加速

Conclusion: AUSM成功统一了提示式和无提示视频分割，通过序列掩码预测方法和并行训练设计，在性能和效率方面都取得了显著提升，为流式视频分割提供了有效的通用解决方案

Abstract: Recent video foundation models such as SAM2 excel at prompted video
segmentation by treating masks as a general-purpose primitive. However, many
real-world settings require unprompted segmentation that aims to detect and
track all objects in a video without external cues, leaving today's landscape
fragmented across task-specific models and pipelines. We recast streaming video
segmentation as sequential mask prediction, analogous to language modeling, and
introduce the Autoregressive Universal Segmentation Model (AUSM), a single
architecture that unifies both prompted and unprompted video segmentation.
Built on recent state-space models, AUSM maintains a fixed-size spatial state
and scales to video streams of arbitrary length. Furthermore, all components of
AUSM are designed for parallel training across frames, yielding substantial
speedups over iterative training. On standard benchmarks (DAVIS17, YouTube-VOS
2018 & 2019, MOSE, YouTube-VIS 2019 & 2021, and OVIS) AUSM outperforms prior
universal streaming video segmentation methods and achieves up to 2.5x faster
training on 16-frame sequences.

Motivation: 4D风格化是一个新兴领域，但缺乏标准化的评估基准。为了促进该领域的发展，需要建立一个全面的评估标准和高质量数据集。

Method: 提出Style4D框架，包含三个关键组件：基础4DGS场景表示、风格高斯表示（使用轻量级MLP进行时空感知外观控制）、以及保持几何完整性的风格迁移模块（通过对比一致性学习和结构内容保持）。

Result: 在Style4D-Bench上的大量实验表明，Style4D在4D风格化方面达到了最先进的性能，能够生成细粒度的风格细节，具有稳定的时间动态和一致的多视角渲染效果。

Conclusion: Style4D-Bench将成为动态3D场景风格化渲染研究中宝贵的基准资源，有望推动该领域的进一步发展。

Abstract: We introduce Style4D-Bench, the first benchmark suite specifically designed
for 4D stylization, with the goal of standardizing evaluation and facilitating
progress in this emerging area. Style4D-Bench comprises: 1) a comprehensive
evaluation protocol measuring spatial fidelity, temporal coherence, and
multi-view consistency through both perceptual and quantitative metrics, 2) a
strong baseline that make an initial attempt for 4D stylization, and 3) a
curated collection of high-resolution dynamic 4D scenes with diverse motions
and complex backgrounds. To establish a strong baseline, we present Style4D, a
novel framework built upon 4D Gaussian Splatting. It consists of three key
components: a basic 4DGS scene representation to capture reliable geometry, a
Style Gaussian Representation that leverages lightweight per-Gaussian MLPs for
temporally and spatially aware appearance control, and a Holistic
Geometry-Preserved Style Transfer module designed to enhance spatio-temporal
consistency via contrastive coherence learning and structural content
preservation. Extensive experiments on Style4D-Bench demonstrate that Style4D
achieves state-of-the-art performance in 4D stylization, producing fine-grained
stylistic details with stable temporal dynamics and consistent multi-view
rendering. We expect Style4D-Bench to become a valuable resource for
benchmarking and advancing research in stylized rendering of dynamic 3D scenes.

TL;DR: Articulate3D是一种无需训练的方法，通过语言控制来调整3D资产的姿态。该方法使用改进的图像生成器创建目标图像，并通过多视角姿态优化将网格对齐到目标图像。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管视觉和语言模型取得了进展，但通过语言控制来调整3D资产姿态的任务仍然具有挑战性。现有方法在保持网格原始身份的同时实现姿态操控方面存在困难。

Method: 1. 使用自注意力重连机制(RSActrl)改进图像生成器，使其能够在不同姿态下保持结构一致性；2. 通过关键点建立输入图像和目标图像之间的对应关系；3. 进行多视角姿态优化来对齐网格。

Result: 该方法在多种3D对象和自由形式文本提示上表现有效，成功操控姿态的同时保持网格原始身份。定量评估和用户研究表明，该方法在85%的情况下优于现有方法。

Conclusion: Articulate3D提供了一种有效的训练免费方法，通过语言指令成功实现3D资产的姿态操控，在保持身份一致性和姿态准确性方面表现出色。

Abstract: We propose a training-free method, Articulate3D, to pose a 3D asset through
language control. Despite advances in vision and language models, this task
remains surprisingly challenging. To achieve this goal, we decompose the
problem into two steps. We modify a powerful image-generator to create target
images conditioned on the input image and a text instruction. We then align the
mesh to the target images through a multi-view pose optimisation step. In
detail, we introduce a self-attention rewiring mechanism (RSActrl) that
decouples the source structure from pose within an image generative model,
allowing it to maintain a consistent structure across varying poses. We
observed that differentiable rendering is an unreliable signal for articulation
optimisation; instead, we use keypoints to establish correspondences between
input and target images. The effectiveness of Articulate3D is demonstrated
across a diverse range of 3D objects and free-form text prompts, successfully
manipulating poses while maintaining the original identity of the mesh.
Quantitative evaluations and a comparative user study, in which our method was
preferred over 85\% of the time, confirm its superiority over existing
approaches. Project page:https://odeb1.github.io/articulate3d_page_deb/

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的3D编辑方法通过编辑多视角图像再重建3D模型，难以精确保持未编辑区域的完整性和整体连贯性

Method: 首先预测3D模型的反转轨迹获取反转潜在表示和键值标记，然后在去噪编辑阶段用保留区域对应的反转特征替换去噪特征

Result: 在Edit3D-Bench数据集上实验表明，VoxHammer在未编辑区域的3D一致性和整体质量方面显著优于现有方法

Conclusion: 该方法为合成高质量编辑配对数据提供了可能，为上下文3D生成奠定了数据基础

Abstract: 3D local editing of specified regions is crucial for game industry and robot
interaction. Recent methods typically edit rendered multi-view images and then
reconstruct 3D models, but they face challenges in precisely preserving
unedited regions and overall coherence. Inspired by structured 3D generative
models, we propose VoxHammer, a novel training-free approach that performs
precise and coherent editing in 3D latent space. Given a 3D model, VoxHammer
first predicts its inversion trajectory and obtains its inverted latents and
key-value tokens at each timestep. Subsequently, in the denoising and editing
phase, we replace the denoising features of preserved regions with the
corresponding inverted latents and cached key-value tokens. By retaining these
contextual features, this approach ensures consistent reconstruction of
preserved areas and coherent integration of edited parts. To evaluate the
consistency of preserved regions, we constructed Edit3D-Bench, a
human-annotated dataset comprising hundreds of samples, each with carefully
labeled 3D editing regions. Experiments demonstrate that VoxHammer
significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of both 3D consistency of
preserved regions and overall quality. Our method holds promise for
synthesizing high-quality edited paired data, thereby laying the data
foundation for in-context 3D generation. See our project page at

Motivation: 电磁信号与文本图像差异大，存在高度异质性、强背景噪声和复杂时频结构，现有通用模型无法直接应用，且缺乏跨任务泛化能力和高质量数据集。

Method: 构建首个统一标准化电磁信号数据集，开发长度自适应多信号打包方法和硬件感知训练策略，利用电磁信号物理特性进行高效表示学习。

Conclusion: EMind通过基础模型方法有效解决了电磁信号处理的根本挑战，为动态频谱管理、智能交通等领域提供了统一的解决方案框架。

Abstract: Deep understanding of electromagnetic signals is fundamental to dynamic
spectrum management, intelligent transportation, autonomous driving and
unmanned vehicle perception. The field faces challenges because electromagnetic
signals differ greatly from text and images, showing high heterogeneity, strong
background noise and complex joint time frequency structure, which prevents
existing general models from direct use. Electromagnetic communication and
sensing tasks are diverse, current methods lack cross task generalization and
transfer efficiency, and the scarcity of large high quality datasets blocks the
creation of a truly general multitask learning framework. To overcome these
issue, we introduce EMind, an electromagnetic signals foundation model that
bridges large scale pretraining and the unique nature of this modality. We
build the first unified and largest standardized electromagnetic signal dataset
covering multiple signal types and tasks. By exploiting the physical properties
of electromagnetic signals, we devise a length adaptive multi-signal packing
method and a hardware-aware training strategy that enable efficient use and
representation learning from heterogeneous multi-source signals. Experiments
show that EMind achieves strong performance and broad generalization across
many downstream tasks, moving decisively from task specific models to a unified
framework for electromagnetic intelligence. The code is available at:

Motivation: 现有基于LLM的文档重排序方法存在排名不确定性、top-k恢复不稳定以及token密集型提示导致的高成本等显著局限性

Method: 提出REALM框架，将LLM推导的相关性建模为高斯分布，并通过递归贝叶斯更新进行细化，显式捕获不确定性并最小化冗余查询

Result: 实验结果表明REALM在显著减少token使用和延迟的同时，超越了最先进的重排序器性能

Conclusion: REALM作为下一代重排序器，为现代信息检索系统提供了更高效、更准确的文档重排序解决方案

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong capabilities in document
re-ranking, a key component in modern Information Retrieval (IR) systems.
However, existing LLM-based approaches face notable limitations, including
ranking uncertainty, unstable top-k recovery, and high token cost due to
token-intensive prompting. To effectively address these limitations, we propose
REALM, an uncertainty-aware re-ranking framework that models LLM-derived
relevance as Gaussian distributions and refines them through recursive Bayesian
updates. By explicitly capturing uncertainty and minimizing redundant queries,
REALM achieves better rankings more efficiently. Experimental results
demonstrate that our REALM surpasses state-of-the-art re-rankers while
significantly reducing token usage and latency, promoting it as the
next-generation re-ranker for modern IR systems.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: DenseRec通过双路径嵌入方法，将稠密内容嵌入投影到ID嵌入空间，有效解决了基于Transformer的序列推荐器在冷启动项目上的性能问题，无需复杂基础设施即可泛化到未见项目。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的基于Transformer的序列推荐器（如SASRec、BERT4Rec）仅依赖学习到的项目ID嵌入，在面对动态项目目录时容易受到项目冷启动问题的影响。虽然预训练模型的稠密内容嵌入提供了潜在解决方案，但直接集成到Transformer推荐器中始终表现不如仅使用ID的方法。

Method: 提出DenseRec方法，采用双路径嵌入方法。在训练期间学习从稠密嵌入空间到ID嵌入空间的线性投影，使得模型能够无缝泛化到之前未见过的项目，无需专门的嵌入模型或复杂的基础设施。

Result: 在三个真实世界数据集上的实验表明，DenseRec始终优于仅使用ID的SASRec基线，即使没有额外的超参数调优且使用紧凑的嵌入模型。分析表明改进主要来自在存在未见项目时更好的序列表示。

Conclusion: DenseRec为冷启动序列推荐提供了一个实用且鲁棒的解决方案，通过简单的线性投影方法有效解决了内容嵌入集成的问题，在保持模型简洁性的同时显著提升了冷启动性能。

Abstract: Transformer-based sequential recommenders, such as SASRec or BERT4Rec,
typically rely solely on learned item ID embeddings, making them vulnerable to
the item cold-start problem, particularly in environments with dynamic item
catalogs. While dense content embeddings from pre-trained models offer
potential solutions, direct integration into transformer-based recommenders has
consistently underperformed compared to ID-only approaches. We revisit this
integration challenge and propose DenseRec, a simple yet effective method that
introduces a dual-path embedding approach. DenseRec learns a linear projection
from the dense embedding space into the ID embedding space during training,
enabling seamless generalization to previously unseen items without requiring
specialized embedding models or complex infrastructure. In experiments on three
real-world datasets, we find DenseRec to consistently outperform an ID-only
SASRec baseline, even without additional hyperparameter tuning and while using
compact embedding models. Our analysis suggests improvements primarily arise
from better sequence representations in the presence of unseen items,
positioning DenseRec as a practical and robust solution for cold-start
sequential recommendation.

Abstract: This study explores three approaches to processing table data in scientific

Pre-trained models for document visual question answering, and (3) Table

approaches preserving table structure outperform the others, particularly in
representing and organizing table content. Accurately recognizing specific
notations and symbols within the documents emerged as a critical factor for
improved results. Our study concludes that preserving the structural integrity

*Jiajie He,Yuechun Gu,Min-Chun Chen,Keke Chen*

TL;DR: 本文首次研究大语言模型推荐系统中的成员推断攻击风险，设计了四种攻击方法，实验证明直接询问和毒化攻击效果显著


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型推荐系统通过上下文学习使用包含敏感历史交互的提示词，可能涉及用户隐私泄露风险，但目前缺乏相关研究

Method: 设计四种成员推断攻击方法：直接询问、幻觉、相似性和毒化攻击，利用LLMs和RecSys的特性，在三个LLM模型和两个标准数据集上进行评估

Result: 实验结果证实了LLM推荐系统的MIA威胁是真实存在的，直接询问和毒化攻击显示出显著高的攻击优势，同时分析了提示中的示例数量和受害者位置等因素的影响

Conclusion: 研究突出了LLM基于推荐系统的隐私泄露风险，提出的四种MIA方法有效地漏洞识别，为设计更安全的推荐系统提供了重要参考

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) based Recommender Systems (RecSys) can flexibly
adapt recommendation systems to different domains. It utilizes in-context
learning (ICL), i.e., the prompts, to customize the recommendation functions,
which include sensitive historical user-specific item interactions, e.g.,
implicit feedback like clicked items or explicit product reviews. Such private
information may be exposed to novel privacy attack. However, no study has been
done on this important issue. We design four membership inference attacks
(MIAs), aiming to reveal whether victims' historical interactions have been
used by system prompts. They are \emph{direct inquiry, hallucination,
similarity, and poisoning attacks}, each of which utilizes the unique features
of LLMs or RecSys. We have carefully evaluated them on three LLMs that have
been used to develop ICL-LLM RecSys and two well-known RecSys benchmark
datasets. The results confirm that the MIA threat on LLM RecSys is realistic:
direct inquiry and poisoning attacks showing significantly high attack
advantages. We have also analyzed the factors affecting these attacks, such as
the number of shots in system prompts and the position of the victim in the
shots.

TL;DR: 提出一种两阶段训练策略，通过对比损失预训练解决ID嵌入在推荐系统中的单轮训练过拟合问题，在Pinterest实际部署中取得显著效果提升


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决基于ID的嵌入在推荐系统中由于数据长尾分布导致的单轮训练过拟合问题（one-epoch problem），提升模型泛化能力

Method: 采用两阶段训练策略：第一阶段使用对比损失进行最小模型预训练，实现更广泛的数据覆盖；第二阶段针对复杂下游推荐任务进行微调

Result: 离线实验显示预训练阶段的多轮训练不会导致过拟合，生成的嵌入在下游任务微调后提升了在线泛化能力；在Pinterest实际部署中获得显著的全站参与度提升

Conclusion: 提出的两阶段预训练策略有效解决了推荐系统中ID嵌入的过拟合问题，通过对比学习实现了更好的数据覆盖和模型泛化性能，在实际生产环境中验证了有效性

Abstract: ID-based embeddings are widely used in web-scale online recommendation
systems. However, their susceptibility to overfitting, particularly due to the
long-tail nature of data distributions, often limits training to a single
epoch, a phenomenon known as the "one-epoch problem." This challenge has driven
research efforts to optimize performance within the first epoch by enhancing
convergence speed or feature sparsity. In this study, we introduce a novel
two-stage training strategy that incorporates a pre-training phase using a
minimal model with contrastive loss, enabling broader data coverage for the
embedding system. Our offline experiments demonstrate that multi-epoch training
during the pre-training phase does not lead to overfitting, and the resulting
embeddings improve online generalization when fine-tuned for more complex
downstream recommendation tasks. We deployed the proposed system in live
traffic at Pinterest, achieving significant site-wide engagement gains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代信息检索系统中基于transformer的向量相似性搜索面临高维表示带来的可扩展性和效率问题

Method: 将压缩策略建模为检索准确性和存储效率之间的零和博弈，推导出保持语义相似性同时减少冗余的潜在变换

Result: 相比FAISS获得显著更高的平均相似度(0.9981 vs 0.5517)和实用性(0.8873 vs 0.5194)，查询时间略有增加

Conclusion: 博弈论潜在压缩在高实用性、基于transformer的搜索应用中具有重要价值，可无缝集成到现有LLM流程中

Abstract: Vector similarity search plays a pivotal role in modern information retrieval
systems, especially when powered by transformer-based embeddings. However, the
scalability and efficiency of such systems are often hindered by the high
dimensionality of latent representations. In this paper, we propose a novel
game-theoretic framework for optimizing latent-space compression to enhance
both the efficiency and semantic utility of vector search. By modeling the
compression strategy as a zero-sum game between retrieval accuracy and storage
efficiency, we derive a latent transformation that preserves semantic
similarity while reducing redundancy. We benchmark our method against FAISS, a
widely-used vector search library, and demonstrate that our approach achieves a
significantly higher average similarity (0.9981 vs. 0.5517) and utility (0.8873
vs. 0.5194), albeit with a modest increase in query time. This trade-off
highlights the practical value of game-theoretic latent compression in
high-utility, transformer-based search applications. The proposed system can be
seamlessly integrated into existing LLM pipelines to yield more semantically
accurate and computationally efficient retrieval.

Motivation: 需要一种与理性对齐、可扩展且可解释的难度信号来支持大语言模型的课程学习训练。

Method: 将难度定义为思维深度(DoT)，通过计算教师模型的思维追踪（如链式思维）中的离散步骤数量来实现，并使用浅到深的DoT课程进行训练。

Result: 提出了三个可验证假设：DoT与理性测试的难度相关；DoT排序课程在同等资源下表现更好；难度在不同教师模型间稳健。

Conclusion: 该方法期望能够推动向基于认知基础、可解释的理性训练课程发展，并提供了对效果验证和实践缓解的框架。

Abstract: Curriculum learning for training LLMs requires a difficulty signal that
aligns with reasoning while remaining scalable and interpretable. We propose a
simple premise: tasks that demand deeper depth of thought for humans should
also be harder for models. Accordingly, we define difficulty as depth of
thought (DoT) and operationalize it by counting the discrete steps in a teacher
model's reasoning trace (e.g., Chain-of-Thought). We then train with a shallow
to deep curriculum ordered by this DoT and outline how to derive, validate, and
schedule it at scale. Our position yields three testable hypotheses: (i) DoT
correlates with conventional difficulty on reasoning benchmarks, (ii)
DoT-ordered curricula outperform length- or judge-scored curricula under
matched budgets, and (iii) the difficulty is robust across teacher models given
light formatting controls. We propose an evaluation framework and discuss
threats to validity (teacher style, length confounds) alongside practical
mitigations. Taken together, we aim to move toward cognitively grounded,
interpretable curricula for reasoning-centric training.

Conclusion: 神经网络可以执行任何类型的推理任务，这个结果比经典的万能近似定理更强大，因为任何万能函数近似器都可以编码为电路并被神经网络模拟。

Abstract: A main open question in contemporary AI research is quantifying the forms of
reasoning neural networks can perform when perfectly trained. This paper
answers this by interpreting reasoning tasks as circuit emulation, where the
gates define the type of reasoning; e.g. Boolean gates for predicate logic,
tropical circuits for dynamic programming, arithmetic and analytic gates for
symbolic mathematical representation, and hybrids thereof for deeper reasoning;
e.g. higher-order logic.
  We present a systematic meta-algorithm that converts essentially any circuit
into a feedforward neural network (NN) with ReLU activations by iteratively
replacing each gate with a canonical ReLU MLP emulator. We show that, on any
digital computer, our construction emulates the circuit exactly--no
approximation, no rounding, modular overflow included--demonstrating that no
reasoning task lies beyond the reach of neural networks. The number of neurons
in the resulting network (parametric complexity) scales with the circuit's
complexity, and the network's computational graph (structure) mirrors that of
the emulated circuit. This formalizes the folklore that NNs networks trade
algorithmic run-time (circuit runtime) for space complexity (number of
neurons).
  We derive a range of applications of our main result, from emulating
shortest-path algorithms on graphs with cubic--size NNs, to simulating stopped
Turing machines with roughly quadratically--large NNs, and even the emulation
of randomized Boolean circuits. Lastly, we demonstrate that our result is
strictly more powerful than a classical universal approximation theorem: any
universal function approximator can be encoded as a circuit and directly
emulated by a NN.

Abstract: Accurately predicting the drift (displacement) of leeway objects in maritime
environments remains a critical challenge, particularly in time-sensitive
scenarios such as search and rescue operations. In this study, we propose a
multi-modal machine learning framework that integrates Sentence Transformer
embeddings with attention-based sequence-to-sequence architectures to predict
the drift of leeway objects in water. We begin by experimentally collecting
environmental and physical data, including water current and wind velocities,
object mass, and surface area, for five distinct leeway objects. Using
simulated data from a Navier-Stokes-based model to train a convolutional neural
network on geometrical image representations, we estimate drag and lift
coefficients of the leeway objects. These coefficients are then used to derive
the net forces responsible for driving the objects' motion. The resulting time
series, comprising physical forces, environmental velocities, and
object-specific features, combined with textual descriptions encoded via a
language model, are inputs to attention-based sequence-to-sequence
long-short-term memory and Transformer models, to predict future drift
trajectories. We evaluate the framework across multiple time horizons ($1$,
$3$, $5$, and $10$ seconds) and assess its generalization across different
objects. We compare our approach against a fitted physics-based model and
traditional machine learning methods, including recurrent neural networks and
temporal convolutional neural networks. Our results show that these multi-modal
models perform comparably to traditional models while also enabling longer-term
forecasting in place of single-step prediction. Overall, our findings
demonstrate the ability of a multi-modal modeling strategy to provide accurate
and adaptable predictions of leeway object drift in dynamic maritime
conditions.

Abstract: Forecasting production reliably and anticipating changes in the behavior of
rock-fluid systems are the main challenges in petroleum reservoir engineering.
This project proposes to deal with this problem through a data-driven approach
and using machine learning methods. The objective is to develop a methodology
to forecast production parameters based on simple data as produced and injected
volumes and, eventually, gauges located in wells, without depending on
information from geological models, fluid properties or details of well
completions and flow systems. Initially, we performed relevance analyses of the
production and injection variables, as well as conditioning the data to suit
the problem. As reservoir conditions change over time, concept drift is a
priority concern and require special attention to those observation windows and
the periodicity of retraining, which are also objects of study. For the
production forecasts, we study supervised learning methods, such as those based
on regressions and Neural Networks, to define the most suitable for our
application in terms of performance and complexity. In a first step, we
evaluate the methodology using synthetic data generated from the UNISIM III
compositional simulation model. Next, we applied it to cases of real plays in
the Brazilian pre-salt. The expected result is the design of a reliable
predictor for reproducing reservoir dynamics, with rapid response, capability
of dealing with practical difficulties such as restrictions in wells and
processing units, and that can be used in actions to support reservoir
management, including the anticipation of deleterious behaviors, optimization
of production and injection parameters and the analysis of the effects of
probabilistic events, aiming to maximize oil recovery.

Abstract: Background: Existing robust, pervasive device-based systems developed in
recent years to detect depression require data collected over a long period and
may not be effective in cases where early detection is crucial.
  Objective: Our main objective was to develop a minimalistic system to
identify depression using data retrieved in the fastest possible time.
  Methods: We developed a fast tool that retrieves the past 7 days' app usage
data in 1 second (mean 0.31, SD 1.10 seconds). A total of 100 students from
Bangladesh participated in our study, and our tool collected their app usage
data. To identify depressed and nondepressed students, we developed a diverse
set of ML models. We selected important features using the stable approach,
along with 3 main types of feature selection (FS) approaches.
  Results: Leveraging only the app usage data retrieved in 1 second, our light
gradient boosting machine model used the important features selected by the
stable FS approach and correctly identified 82.4% (n=42) of depressed students
(precision=75%, F1-score=78.5%). Moreover, after comprehensive exploration, we
presented a parsimonious stacking model where around 5 features selected by the
all-relevant FS approach Boruta were used in each iteration of validation and
showed a maximum precision of 77.4% (balanced accuracy=77.9%). A SHAP analysis
of our best models presented behavioral markers that were related to
depression.
  Conclusions: Due to our system's fast and minimalistic nature, it may make a
worthwhile contribution to identifying depression in underdeveloped and
developing regions. In addition, our detailed discussion about the implication
of our findings can facilitate the development of less resource-intensive
systems to better understand students who are depressed.

Abstract: High dropout and failure rates in distance education pose a significant
challenge for academic institutions, making the proactive identification of
at-risk students crucial for providing timely support. This study develops and
evaluates a machine learning model based on early academic performance and
digital engagement patterns from the large-scale OULAD dataset to predict
student risk at a UK university. To address the practical challenges of data
privacy and institutional silos that often hinder such initiatives, we
implement the model using a Federated Learning (FL) framework. We compare model
complexity (Logistic Regression vs. a Deep Neural Network) and data balancing.
The final federated model demonstrates strong predictive capability, achieving
an ROC AUC score of approximately 85% in identifying at-risk students. Our
findings show that this federated approach provides a practical and scalable
solution for institutions to build effective early-warning systems, enabling
proactive student support while inherently respecting data privacy.

Abstract: While imaging-genetics holds great promise for unraveling the complex
interplay between brain structure and genetic variation in neurological
disorders, traditional methods are limited to simplistic linear models or to
black-box techniques that lack interpretability. In this paper, we present
NeuroPathX, an explainable deep learning framework that uses an early fusion
strategy powered by cross-attention mechanisms to capture meaningful
interactions between structural variations in the brain derived from MRI and
established biological pathways derived from genetics data. To enhance
interpretability and robustness, we introduce two loss functions over the
attention matrix - a sparsity loss that focuses on the most salient
interactions and a pathway similarity loss that enforces consistent
representations across the cohort. We validate NeuroPathX on both autism
spectrum disorder and Alzheimer's disease. Our results demonstrate that
NeuroPathX outperforms competing baseline approaches and reveals biologically
plausible associations linked to the disorder. These findings underscore the
potential of NeuroPathX to advance our understanding of complex brain
disorders. Code is available at https://github.com/jueqiw/NeuroPathX .

Result: 在攻击效率和鲁棒训练方面取得了显著提升，证明了框架的有效性。

Conclusion: SALMAN框架是一个实用的、模型无关的工具，可用于提升基于Transformer的NLP系统的可靠性。

Abstract: Recent strides in pretrained transformer-based language models have propelled
state-of-the-art performance in numerous NLP tasks. Yet, as these models grow
in size and deployment, their robustness under input perturbations becomes an
increasingly urgent question. Existing robustness methods often diverge between
small-parameter and large-scale models (LLMs), and they typically rely on
labor-intensive, sample-specific adversarial designs. In this paper, we propose
a unified, local (sample-level) robustness framework (SALMAN) that evaluates
model stability without modifying internal parameters or resorting to complex
perturbation heuristics. Central to our approach is a novel Distance Mapping
Distortion (DMD) measure, which ranks each sample's susceptibility by comparing
input-to-output distance mappings in a near-linear complexity manner. By
demonstrating significant gains in attack efficiency and robust training, we
position our framework as a practical, model-agnostic tool for advancing the
reliability of transformer-based NLP systems.

Abstract: Recent studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of position encoding in
transformer architectures. By incorporating positional information, this
approach provides essential guidance for modeling dependencies between elements
across different sequence positions. We introduce CoPE (a lightweight Complex
Positional Encoding), a novel architecture that leverages complex-valued
encoding to encode both content and positional information. Our approach
replaces traditional positional encodings with complex embeddings where the
real part captures semantic content and the imaginary part encodes positional
information. We introduce phase-aware attention in the first layer of the
transformer model to capture position-dependent patterns, followed by standard
attention layers for higher-levels. We show that CoPE doesn't exhibit long term
decay and is compatible with linear attention. Experimental evaluation on the
GLUE benchmark suggest that our approach achieves superior performance with
less computational complexity, compared to RoPE, Sinusoidal and Learned

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has emerged as a simple and effective
approach for aligning large language models (LLMs) with human preferences,
bypassing the need for a learned reward model. Despite its growing adoption, a
fundamental question remains open: what characteristics of preference data are
most critical for DPO performance? In this work, we provide a systematic study
of how preference data distribution influences DPO, from both theoretical and
empirical perspectives. We show that the quality of chosen responses plays a
dominant role in optimizing the DPO objective, while the quality of rejected
responses may have relatively limited impact. Our theoretical analysis
characterizes the optimal response distribution under DPO and reveals how
contrastiveness between responses helps primarily by improving the chosen
samples. We further study an online DPO setting and show it effectively reduces
to supervised fine-tuning on the chosen responses. Extensive experiments across
diverse tasks confirm our findings: improving the quality of chosen responses
consistently boosts performance regardless of the quality of the rejected
responses. We also investigate the benefit of mixing the on-policy data. Our
results interpret the mechanism behind some widely adopted strategies and offer
practical insights for constructing high-impact preference datasets for LLM
alignment.

Result: 在两个公共数据集上评估五个临床重要任务（死亡率预测、再入院预测、住院时长预测、药物推荐、表型预测），结果显示ProtoEHR相比基线方法能够做出更准确、鲁棒和可解释的预测。

Conclusion: ProtoEHR框架能够充分利用EHR数据的多层次结构，在提升预测性能的同时提供代码、就诊和患者层面的可解释性洞察，有助于医疗预测决策。

Abstract: Digital healthcare systems have enabled the collection of mass healthcare
data in electronic healthcare records (EHRs), allowing artificial intelligence
solutions for various healthcare prediction tasks. However, existing studies
often focus on isolated components of EHR data, limiting their predictive
performance and interpretability. To address this gap, we propose ProtoEHR, an
interpretable hierarchical prototype learning framework that fully exploits the
rich, multi-level structure of EHR data to enhance healthcare predictions. More
specifically, ProtoEHR models relationships within and across three
hierarchical levels of EHRs: medical codes, hospital visits, and patients. We
first leverage large language models to extract semantic relationships among
medical codes and construct a medical knowledge graph as the knowledge source.
Building on this, we design a hierarchical representation learning framework
that captures contextualized representations across three levels, while
incorporating prototype information within each level to capture intrinsic
similarities and improve generalization. To perform a comprehensive assessment,
we evaluate ProtoEHR in two public datasets on five clinically significant
tasks, including prediction of mortality, prediction of readmission, prediction
of length of stay, drug recommendation, and prediction of phenotype. The
results demonstrate the ability of ProtoEHR to make accurate, robust, and
interpretable predictions compared to baselines in the literature. Furthermore,
ProtoEHR offers interpretable insights on code, visit, and patient levels to
aid in healthcare prediction.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ZTFed-MAS2S是一个零信任联邦学习框架，结合多头注意力序列到序列插补模型，用于风电数据缺失值处理，通过可验证差分隐私和零知识证明确保隐私安全，动态信任聚合机制提升鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 风电数据常因传感器故障和传输不稳定而缺失，联邦学习虽能保护隐私但易受异常更新和隐私泄露攻击，工业开放环境需要零信任机制。

Method: 集成多头注意力序列到序列插补模型，采用可验证差分隐私与非交互零知识证明，动态信任感知聚合机制通过相似图传播信任，使用稀疏化和量化压缩降低通信开销。

Result: 在真实风电场数据集上的大量实验验证了ZTFed-MAS2S在联邦学习性能和缺失数据插补方面的优越性。

Conclusion: 该框架为能源领域实际应用提供了安全高效的解决方案，有效解决了风电数据缺失和隐私保护问题。

Abstract: Wind power data often suffers from missing values due to sensor faults and
unstable transmission at edge sites. While federated learning enables
privacy-preserving collaboration without sharing raw data, it remains
vulnerable to anomalous updates and privacy leakage during parameter exchange.
These challenges are amplified in open industrial environments, necessitating
zero-trust mechanisms where no participant is inherently trusted. To address
these challenges, this work proposes ZTFed-MAS2S, a zero-trust federated
learning framework that integrates a multi-head attention-based
sequence-to-sequence imputation model. ZTFed integrates verifiable differential
privacy with non-interactive zero-knowledge proofs and a confidentiality and
integrity verification mechanism to ensure verifiable privacy preservation and
secure model parameters transmission. A dynamic trust-aware aggregation
mechanism is employed, where trust is propagated over similarity graphs to
enhance robustness, and communication overhead is reduced via sparsity- and
quantization-based compression. MAS2S captures long-term dependencies in wind
power data for accurate imputation. Extensive experiments on real-world wind
farm datasets validate the superiority of ZTFed-MAS2S in both federated
learning performance and missing data imputation, demonstrating its
effectiveness as a secure and efficient solution for practical applications in
the energy sector.

*Jarek Duda,Jagoda Bracha,Adrian Przybysz*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HSIC是当前最先进的统计依赖性评估方法，但计算复杂度高。本文提出HCR方法，具有线性计算成本、更高的依赖性敏感性，并能提供联合分布模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HSIC方法在处理大规模数据时计算复杂度太高（O(n^2.37)），需要一种更高效的替代方案来评估数据样本间的统计依赖性。

Method: 提出HCR（分层相关性重建）方法，通过混合矩特征描述依赖性，从相关性和同方差性开始，每个依赖性特征可在O(n)线性时间内计算。

Result: HCR方法不仅计算效率更高（线性复杂度），而且在测试中表现出比HSIC更高的依赖性敏感性，同时能够近似互信息作为非平凡混合矩的平方和。

Conclusion: HCR是HSIC的实用替代方案，具有线性计算成本、更好的性能，并能提供实际的联合分布模型，适用于大规模数据分析。

Abstract: Evaluation of statistical dependencies between two data samples is a basic
problem of data science/machine learning, and HSIC (Hilbert-Schmidt Information
Criterion)~\cite{HSIC} is considered the state-of-art method. However, for size
$n$ data sample it requires multiplication of $n\times n$ matrices, what
currently needs $\sim O(n^{2.37})$ computational complexity~\cite{mult}, making
it impractical for large data samples. We discuss HCR (Hierarchical Correlation
Reconstruction) as its linear cost practical alternative of even higher
dependence sensitivity in tests, and additionally providing actual joint
distribution model by description of dependencies through features being mixed
moments, starting with correlation and homoscedasticity, also allowing to
approximate mutual information as just sum of squares of such nontrivial mixed
moments between two data samples. Such single dependence describing feature is
calculated in $O(n)$ linear time. Their number to test varies with dimension
$d$ - requiring $O(d^2)$ for pairwise dependencies, $O(d^3)$ if wanting to also
consider more subtle triplewise, and so on.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出DualSparse-MoE系统，通过识别和利用张量级和神经元级的双重稀疏性，在保持模型准确性的同时大幅提升混合专家模型的计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然混合专家(MoE)模型通过稀疏激活提高了效率，但仍面临大规模计算和不可预测的激活模式带来的挑战。需要一种无需重新训练的方法来进一步提升部署效率。

Method: 提出训练后专家分割技术，通过动态张量级计算丢弃和静态神经元级重构的结合，在保持模型数学一致性的前提下实现效率提升。

Result: 实验结果显示，在约25%的计算丢弃率下，平均准确性仅下降0.08%-0.28%，同时计算速度成比例提升。统计负载均衡技术还能实现1.41倍的模块速度提升，准确性仅下降0.5%。

Conclusion: DualSparse-MoE系统通过利用双重稀疏性，在几乎无法察觉的准确性损失下实现了显著的计算效率提升，为大型MoE模型的高效部署提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Mixture of Experts (MoE) has become a mainstream architecture for building
Large Language Models (LLMs) by reducing per-token computation while enabling
model scaling. It can be viewed as partitioning a large Feed-Forward Network
(FFN) at the tensor level into fine-grained sub-FFNs, or experts, and
activating only a sparse subset for each input. While this sparsity improves
efficiency, MoE still faces substantial challenges due to their massive
computational scale and unpredictable activation patterns.
  To enable efficient MoE deployment, we identify dual sparsity at the tensor
and neuron levels in pre-trained MoE modules as a key factor for both accuracy
and efficiency. Unlike prior work that increases tensor-level sparsity through
finer-grained expert design during pre-training, we introduce post-training
expert partitioning to induce such sparsity without retraining. This preserves
the mathematical consistency of model transformations and enhances both
efficiency and accuracy in subsequent fine-tuning and inference. Building upon
this, we propose DualSparse-MoE, an inference system that integrates dynamic
tensor-level computation dropping with static neuron-level reconstruction to
deliver significant efficiency gains with minimal accuracy loss.
  Experimental results show that enforcing an approximate 25% drop rate with
our approach reduces average accuracy by only 0.08%-0.28% across three
prevailing MoE models, while nearly all degrees of computation dropping
consistently yield proportional computational speedups. Furthermore,
incorporating load-imbalance awareness into expert parallelism achieves a 1.41x
MoE module speedup with just 0.5% average accuracy degradation.

Abstract: The groundbreaking performance of deep neural networks (NNs) promoted a surge
of interest in providing a mathematical basis to deep learning theory. Low-rank
tensor decompositions are specially befitting for this task due to their close
connection to NNs and their rich theoretical results. Different tensor
decompositions have strong uniqueness guarantees, which allow for a direct
interpretation of their factors, and polynomial time algorithms have been
proposed to compute them. Through the connections between tensors and NNs, such
results supported many important advances in the theory of NNs. In this review,
we show how low-rank tensor methods--which have been a core tool in the signal
processing and machine learning communities--play a fundamental role in
theoretically explaining different aspects of the performance of deep NNs,
including their expressivity, algorithmic learnability and computational
hardness, generalization, and identifiability. Our goal is to give an
accessible overview of existing approaches (developed by different communities,
ranging from computer science to mathematics) in a coherent and unified way,
and to open a broader perspective on the use of low-rank tensor decompositions
for the theory of deep NNs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决极端稀疏奖励环境中传统强化学习因正反馈稀少而难以有效学习的问题

Method: 结合VSIMR(使用VAE奖励状态新颖性)和LLM(利用预训练知识基于环境和目标描述生成奖励信号)，在MiniGrid DoorKey环境中使用Actor-Critic(A2C)代理实现

Result: 组合策略相比单独使用任一策略或标准A2C代理，显著提高了代理性能和采样效率，标准A2C代理完全无法学习

Conclusion: VSIMR驱动新状态探索，LLM奖励促进目标导向的渐进式利用，两者互补有效解决了稀疏奖励环境中的学习挑战

Abstract: This paper explores the combination of two intrinsic motivation strategies to
improve the efficiency of reinforcement learning (RL) agents in environments
with extreme sparse rewards, where traditional learning struggles due to
infrequent positive feedback. We propose integrating Variational State as
Intrinsic Reward (VSIMR), which uses Variational AutoEncoders (VAEs) to reward
state novelty, with an intrinsic reward approach derived from Large Language
Models (LLMs). The LLMs leverage their pre-trained knowledge to generate reward
signals based on environment and goal descriptions, guiding the agent. We
implemented this combined approach with an Actor-Critic (A2C) agent in the
MiniGrid DoorKey environment, a benchmark for sparse rewards. Our empirical
results show that this combined strategy significantly increases agent
performance and sampling efficiency compared to using each strategy
individually or a standard A2C agent, which failed to learn. Analysis of
learning curves indicates that the combination effectively complements
different aspects of the environment and task: VSIMR drives exploration of new
states, while the LLM-derived rewards facilitate progressive exploitation
towards goals.

Method: 使用全局高斯过程的梯度和Hessian矩阵构建多个局部二次模型，通过求解边界约束二次规划选择新采样点

Result: 方法提高了TuRBO的有效性，在合成函数和实际应用中超越了多种高维贝叶斯优化技术

Conclusion: 该方法成功结合了全局GP的采样效率和局部模型的异构建模能力，为高维贝叶斯优化提供了有效的解决方案

Abstract: Bayesian Optimization (BO) has been widely applied to optimize expensive
black-box functions while retaining sample efficiency. However, scaling BO to
high-dimensional spaces remains challenging. Existing literature proposes
performing standard BO in multiple local trust regions (TuRBO) for
heterogeneous modeling of the objective function and avoiding over-exploration.
Despite its advantages, using local Gaussian Processes (GPs) reduces sampling
efficiency compared to a global GP. To enhance sampling efficiency while
preserving heterogeneous modeling, we propose to construct multiple local
quadratic models using gradients and Hessians from a global GP, and select new
sample points by solving the bound-constrained quadratic program. Additionally,
we address the issue of vanishing gradients of GPs in high-dimensional spaces.
We provide a convergence analysis and demonstrate through experimental results
that our method enhances the efficacy of TuRBO and outperforms a wide range of
high-dimensional BO techniques on synthetic functions and real-world
applications.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种专门用于Verilog代码生成的强化学习框架VERIRL，通过Trace-back重新评分机制和样本均衡策略解决了套件语言代码生成中的奖励信号稀疏和噪声问题，在Verilog生成任务上实现了独制性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 硬件描述语言(HDL)如Verilog在代码生成领域得到的关注较少，主要因为其并发语义、语法严格性和模拟复杂性带来的挑战。现有方法如CraftRTL依赖大规模闭源模型的矩阵矩阵化，而DeepSeek类方法则面临稀疏反馈的问题。

Abstract: Recent advancements in code generation have shown remarkable success across
software domains, yet hardware description languages (HDLs) such as Verilog
remain underexplored due to their concurrency semantics, syntactic rigidity,
and simulation complexity. In this work, we address these challenges by
introducing a reinforcement learning (RL) framework tailored for Verilog code
generation. We first construct Veribench-53K, a high-quality dataset curated
from over 700K Verilog problems, enriched with structured prompts, complexity
labels, and diverse testbenches. To tackle the problem of sparse and noisy
reward signals, we propose a Trace-back based Rescore mechanism that leverages
reasoning paths and iterative refinement to enhance feedback reliability and
support reward model training. Furthermore, to mitigate catastrophic forgetting
and overfitting during RL fine-tuning, we introduce a sample-balanced weighting
strategy that adaptively balances learning dynamics based on reward-probability
distributions. These innovations are integrated into an iterative RL pipeline
that co-evolves the policy and reward models. In contrast to recent work such
as CraftRTL, which relies on large-scale closed-source model distillation, and
DeepSeek-style approaches that struggle with sparse feedback, our method
demonstrates superior performance using a smaller but high-quality dataset
combined with RL optimization. Experiments on Verilog generation tasks
demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, with substantial gains in test pass
rate, functional correctness, and compilation robustness. Our findings
highlight the potential of RL-driven approaches for structured code generation
in hardware-centric domains. VERIRL is publicly available at

Conclusion: 该框架为现实世界异常检测任务提供了可扩展且高效的解决方案，特别适用于低标签系统

Abstract: Anomaly detection in time series data is important for applications in
finance, healthcare, sensor networks, and industrial monitoring. Traditional
methods usually struggle with limited labeled data, high false-positive rates,
and difficulty generalizing to novel anomaly types. To overcome these
challenges, we propose a reinforcement learning-based framework that integrates
dynamic reward shaping, Variational Autoencoder (VAE), and active learning,
called DRTA. Our method uses an adaptive reward mechanism that balances
exploration and exploitation by dynamically scaling the effect of VAE-based
reconstruction error and classification rewards. This approach enables the
agent to detect anomalies effectively in low-label systems while maintaining
high precision and recall. Our experimental results on the Yahoo A1 and Yahoo
A2 benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed method consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised and semi-supervised approaches. These
findings show that our framework is a scalable and efficient solution for
real-world anomaly detection tasks.

Method: 研究不同数据增强策略（包括SalUn、随机标签和微调）对遗忘方法性能的影响，在CIFAR-10和CIFAR-100数据集上，使用不同的遗忘率进行实验。

Abstract: Machine Unlearning (MU) aims to remove the influence of specific data from a

of systematic augmentation design in MU remains under-investigated. In this
work, we investigate the impact of different data augmentation strategies on
the performance of unlearning methods, including SalUn, Random Label, and
Fine-Tuning. Experiments conducted on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, under varying

unlearning effectiveness, reducing the performance gap to retrained models.
Results showed a reduction of up to 40.12% of the Average Gap unlearning

Conclusion: 该方法为机器学习技术与量子算法设计的整合开辟了有前景的途径，RL驱动的参数初始化能够加速VQAs的可扩展性和实际部署

Abstract: Variational Quantum Algorithms (VQAs) have gained prominence as a viable
framework for exploiting near-term quantum devices in applications ranging from
optimization and chemistry simulation to machine learning. However, the
effectiveness of VQAs is often constrained by the so-called barren plateau
problem, wherein gradients diminish exponentially as system size or circuit
depth increases, thereby hindering training. In this work, we propose a
reinforcement learning (RL)-based initialization strategy to alleviate the
barren plateau issue by reshaping the initial parameter landscape to avoid
regions prone to vanishing gradients. In particular, we explore several RL
algorithms (Deterministic Policy Gradient, Soft Actor-Critic, and Proximal
Policy Optimization, etc.) to generate the circuit parameters (treated as
actions) that minimize the VQAs cost function before standard gradient-based
optimization. By pre-training with RL in this manner, subsequent optimization
using methods such as gradient descent or Adam proceeds from a more favorable
initial state. Extensive numerical experiments under various noise conditions
and tasks consistently demonstrate that the RL-based initialization method
significantly enhances both convergence speed and final solution quality.
Moreover, comparisons among different RL algorithms highlight that multiple
approaches can achieve comparable performance gains, underscoring the
flexibility and robustness of our method. These findings shed light on a
promising avenue for integrating machine learning techniques into quantum
algorithm design, offering insights into how RL-driven parameter initialization
can accelerate the scalability and practical deployment of VQAs. Opening up a
promising path for the research community in machine learning for quantum,
especially barren plateau problems in VQAs.

Conclusion: BTW框架有效解决了多模态学习中噪声模态问题，提供了可扩展的实例级控制方案，在多个实际应用中表现出优越性能

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models have become increasingly powerful in
multimodal learning by enabling modular specialization across modalities.
However, their effectiveness remains unclear when additional modalities
introduce more noise than complementary information. Existing approaches, such
as the Partial Information Decomposition, struggle to scale beyond two
modalities and lack the resolution needed for instance-level control. We
propose Beyond Two-modality Weighting (BTW), a bi-level, non-parametric
weighting framework that combines instance-level Kullback-Leibler (KL)
divergence and modality-level mutual information (MI) to dynamically adjust
modality importance during training. Our method does not require additional
parameters and can be applied to an arbitrary number of modalities.
Specifically, BTW computes per-example KL weights by measuring the divergence
between each unimodal and the current multimodal prediction, and modality-wide
MI weights by estimating global alignment between unimodal and multimodal
outputs. Extensive experiments on sentiment regression and clinical
classification demonstrate that our method significantly improves regression
performance and multiclass classification accuracy.

Abstract: Molecular property prediction is a crucial task that guides the design of new
compounds, including drugs and materials. While explainable artificial
intelligence methods aim to scrutinize model predictions by identifying
influential molecular substructures, many existing approaches rely on masking
strategies that remove either atoms or atom-level features to assess importance
via fidelity metrics. These methods, however, often fail to adhere to the
underlying molecular distribution and thus yield unintuitive explanations. In
this work, we propose counterfactual masking, a novel framework that replaces
masked substructures with chemically reasonable fragments sampled from
generative models trained to complete molecular graphs. Rather than evaluating
masked predictions against implausible zeroed-out baselines, we assess them
relative to counterfactual molecules drawn from the data distribution. Our
method offers two key benefits: (1) molecular realism underpinning robust and
distribution-consistent explanations, and (2) meaningful counterfactuals that
directly indicate how structural modifications may affect predicted properties.
We demonstrate that counterfactual masking is well-suited for benchmarking
model explainers and yields more actionable insights across multiple datasets
and property prediction tasks. Our approach bridges the gap between
explainability and molecular design, offering a principled and generative path
toward explainable machine learning in chemistry.

Abstract: A recent paper, ``A Graphon-Signal Analysis of Graph Neural Networks'', by
Levie, analyzed message passing graph neural networks (MPNNs) by embedding the
input space of MPNNs, i.e., attributed graphs (graph-signals), to a space of
attributed graphons (graphon-signals). Based on extensions of standard results
in graphon analysis to graphon-signals, the paper proved a generalization bound
and a sampling lemma for MPNNs. However, there are some missing ingredients in
that paper, limiting its applicability in practical settings of graph machine
learning. In the current paper, we introduce several refinements and extensions
to existing results that address these shortcomings. In detail, 1) we extend
the main results in the paper to graphon-signals with multidimensional signals
(rather than 1D signals), 2) we extend the Lipschitz continuity to MPNNs with
readout with respect to cut distance (rather than MPNNs without readout with
respect to cut metric), 3) we improve the generalization bound by utilizing
robustness-type generalization bounds, and 4) we extend the analysis to
non-symmetric graphons and kernels.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SPF框架通过随机推前策略，在保持一步训练的同时实现多步学习，平衡短期和长期性能，降低内存需求


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统数据驱动方法在复杂系统中长期精度下降，自回归训练需要大量GPU内存且可能牺牲短期性能

Method: 构建模型预测的补充数据集，通过随机采集策略结合真实数据，在epoch间预计算多步预测，避免存储完整展开序列

Result: 在Burgers方程和浅水基准测试中，SPF比自回归方法获得更高的长期精度，同时降低内存需求

Conclusion: SPF框架为资源受限和复杂模拟提供了有前景的解决方案，平衡了性能与计算效率

Abstract: Data-driven methods are emerging as efficient alternatives to traditional
numerical forecasting, offering fast inference and lower computational cost.
Yet, for complex systems, long-term accuracy often deteriorates due to error
accumulation, and autoregressive training (though effective) demands large GPU
memory and may sacrifice short-term performance. We propose the Stochastic
PushForward (SPF) framework, which retains one-step-ahead training while
enabling multi-step learning. SPF builds a supplementary dataset from model
predictions and combines it with ground truth via a stochastic acquisition
strategy, balancing short- and long-term performance while reducing
overfitting. Multi-step predictions are precomputed between epochs, keeping
memory usage stable without storing full unrolled sequences. Experiments on the
Burgers' equation and the Shallow Water benchmark show that SPF achieves higher
long-term accuracy than autoregressive methods while lowering memory
requirements, making it promising for resource-limited and complex simulations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决在数据稀缺情况下从氨基酸序列预测蛋白质功能的挑战，特别是在蛋白质设计中当只有少量标记数据可用时的机器学习应用问题

Method: 使用在微调ESM2嵌入上训练的稀疏自编码器(SAEs)，评估其在多种适应性外推和蛋白质工程任务中的表现

Result: SAEs在适应性预测中始终优于或与ESM2基准相竞争，其稀疏潜在空间编码了紧凑且具有生物学意义的表示，能够从有限数据中更有效地泛化。在83%的情况下，通过引导预测潜在变量能够产生顶级适应性变体

Conclusion: SAEs为低数据量蛋白质功能预测和设计提供了有效的解决方案，其稀疏潜在表示能够更好地捕捉生物学特征并指导蛋白质工程

Abstract: Predicting protein function from amino acid sequence remains a central
challenge in data-scarce (low-$N$) regimes, limiting machine learning-guided
protein design when only small amounts of assay-labeled sequence-function data
are available. Protein language models (pLMs) have advanced the field by
providing evolutionary-informed embeddings and sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have
enabled decomposition of these embeddings into interpretable latent variables
that capture structural and functional features. However, the effectiveness of
SAEs for low-$N$ function prediction and protein design has not been
systematically studied. Herein, we evaluate SAEs trained on fine-tuned ESM2
embeddings across diverse fitness extrapolation and protein engineering tasks.
We show that SAEs, with as few as 24 sequences, consistently outperform or
compete with their ESM2 baselines in fitness prediction, indicating that their
sparse latent space encodes compact and biologically meaningful representations
that generalize more effectively from limited data. Moreover, steering
predictive latents exploits biological motifs in pLM representations, yielding
top-fitness variants in 83% of cases compared to designing with ESM2 alone.

Motivation: 药物发现过程复杂且资源密集，需要早期预测批准结果以优化研发投资。传统机器学习和深度学习方法在药物批准预测中表现出潜力，但可解释性有限限制了其实际影响。

Method: 开发DrugReasoner模型，基于LLaMA架构，使用组相对策略优化(GRPO)进行微调。整合分子描述符，通过与结构相似的已批准和未批准化合物进行对比推理，生成预测结果、逐步推理过程和置信度分数。

Result: 在验证集上AUC为0.732，F1分数0.729；测试集上AUC 0.725，F1分数0.718。优于逻辑回归、支持向量机、k近邻等传统基线方法，与XGBoost性能相当。在外部独立数据集上AUC 0.728，F1分数0.774，优于基线和ChemAP模型，保持高精度和平衡的敏感性。

Conclusion: DrugReasoner不仅提供有竞争力的预测准确性，还通过推理输出增强透明度，解决了AI辅助药物发现中的关键瓶颈。研究表明推理增强的LLMs有望成为药物决策中可解释且有效的工具。

Abstract: Drug discovery is a complex and resource-intensive process, making early
prediction of approval outcomes critical for optimizing research investments.
While classical machine learning and deep learning methods have shown promise
in drug approval prediction, their limited interpretability constraints their
impact. Here, we present DrugReasoner, a reasoning-based large language model
(LLM) built on the LLaMA architecture and fine-tuned with group relative policy
optimization (GRPO) to predict the likelihood of small-molecule approval.
DrugReasoner integrates molecular descriptors with comparative reasoning
against structurally similar approved and unapproved compounds, generating
predictions alongside step-by-step rationales and confidence scores.
DrugReasoner achieved robust performance with an AUC of 0.732 and an F1 score
of 0.729 on the validation set and 0.725 and 0.718 on the test set,
respectively. These results outperformed conventional baselines, including
logistic regression, support vector machine, and k-nearest neighbors and had
competitive performance relative to XGBoost. On an external independent
dataset, DrugReasoner outperformed both baseline and the recently developed
ChemAP model, achieving an AUC of 0.728 and an F1-score of 0.774, while
maintaining high precision and balanced sensitivity, demonstrating robustness
in real-world scenarios. These findings demonstrate that DrugReasoner not only
delivers competitive predictive accuracy but also enhances transparency through
its reasoning outputs, thereby addressing a key bottleneck in AI-assisted drug
discovery. This study highlights the potential of reasoning-augmented LLMs as
interpretable and effective tools for pharmaceutical decision-making.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RhymeRL是一个针对大语言模型强化学习的系统，通过历史相似性优化解决了GPU利用率低的问题，实现了2.6倍的性能提升且不损失准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前RL系统存在严重的GPU利用率不足问题，主要原因是rollout阶段占主导地位和rollout长度不平衡导致的GPU气泡。现有解决方案如异步执行和截断会牺牲训练准确性。

Method: 提出了RhymeRL系统，包含两个关键创新：1) HistoSpec - 基于历史rollout令牌序列相似性的推测解码推理引擎；2) HistoPipe - 基于历史rollout分布相似性的两层调度策略。

Result: 在真实生产环境中验证，展示了从几十到数千个GPU的可扩展性，相比现有方法实现了2.6倍的性能提升。

Conclusion: RhymeRL通过利用历史相似性有效解决了RL训练中的GPU利用率问题，在不改变RL范式或牺牲准确性的前提下显著提升了训练效率。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs), reinforcement
learning (RL) has emerged as a pivotal methodology for enhancing the reasoning
capabilities of LLMs. Unlike traditional pre-training approaches, RL
encompasses multiple stages: rollout, reward, and training, which necessitates
collaboration among various worker types. However, current RL systems continue
to grapple with substantial GPU underutilization, due to two primary factors:
(1) The rollout stage dominates the overall RL process due to test-time
scaling; (2) Imbalances in rollout lengths (within the same batch) result in
GPU bubbles. While prior solutions like asynchronous execution and truncation
offer partial relief, they may compromise training accuracy for efficiency.
  Our key insight stems from a previously overlooked observation: rollout
responses exhibit remarkable similarity across adjacent training epochs. Based
on the insight, we introduce RhymeRL, an LLM RL system designed to accelerate
RL training with two key innovations. First, to enhance rollout generation, we
present HistoSpec, a speculative decoding inference engine that utilizes the
similarity of historical rollout token sequences to obtain accurate drafts.
Second, to tackle rollout bubbles, we introduce HistoPipe, a two-tier
scheduling strategy that leverages the similarity of historical rollout
distributions to balance workload among rollout workers. We have evaluated
RhymeRL within a real production environment, demonstrating scalability from
dozens to thousands of GPUs. Experimental results demonstrate that RhymeRL
achieves a 2.6x performance improvement over existing methods, without
compromising accuracy or modifying the RL paradigm.

also develop a Krasnosel'ski\u \i-Mann fixed-point algorithm to optimize this

this type of algorithms. Extensive experiments show that the proposed method

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 时间序列数据中训练和测试数据集之间经常出现分布偏移，现有的无监督域自适应方法需要更好地处理这种挑战，提高模型在未标记测试数据上的泛化能力和鲁棒性。

Method: 采用多尺度混合输入架构捕获不同尺度的特征，增加训练多样性并减少域间特征差异；基于证据学习引入不确定性感知机制，通过对标签施加Dirichlet先验来同时进行目标预测和不确定性估计。

Result: 该方法在目标域上实现了显著的性能提升，不确定性感知模型显示出更低的预期校准误差(ECE)，表明预测置信度校准更好，在多个基准数据集上达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: 多尺度混合输入架构与不确定性感知机制的结合方法在时间序列数据的无监督域自适应中非常有效，能够显著提高模型泛化能力和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Unsupervised domain adaptation methods seek to generalize effectively on
unlabeled test data, especially when encountering the common challenge in time
series data that distribution shifts occur between training and testing
datasets. In this paper, we propose incorporating multi-scale feature
extraction and uncertainty estimation to improve the model's generalization and
robustness across domains. Our approach begins with a multi-scale mixed input
architecture that captures features at different scales, increasing training
diversity and reducing feature discrepancies between the training and testing
domains. Based on the mixed input architecture, we further introduce an
uncertainty awareness mechanism based on evidential learning by imposing a
Dirichlet prior on the labels to facilitate both target prediction and
uncertainty estimation. The uncertainty awareness mechanism enhances domain
adaptation by aligning features with the same labels across different domains,
which leads to significant performance improvements in the target domain.
Additionally, our uncertainty-aware model demonstrates a much lower Expected
Calibration Error (ECE), indicating better-calibrated prediction confidence.
Our experimental results show that this combined approach of mixed input
architecture with the uncertainty awareness mechanism achieves state-of-the-art
performance across multiple benchmark datasets, underscoring its effectiveness
in unsupervised domain adaptation for time series data.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: STRATA-TS是一个针对城市时间序列预测的选择性迁移学习框架，通过目标感知检索和大型语言模型推理，解决数据稀缺城市的预测问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 城市预测面临严重的数据不平衡问题：少数城市有密集的长期记录，而许多其他城市只有短期或不完整的历史数据。直接迁移学习不可靠，因为只有有限的源模式真正有益于目标域，而不加选择的迁移可能引入噪声和负迁移。

Method: STRATA-TS结合领域自适应检索和推理能力强大的大型模型，使用基于补丁的时间编码器识别与目标查询语义和动态对齐的源子序列，然后通过检索引导的推理阶段，让LLM对目标输入和检索到的支持进行结构化推理。

Result: 在新加坡、诺丁汉和格拉斯哥的三个停车可用性数据集上的广泛实验表明，STRATA-TS始终优于强大的预测和迁移基线。

Conclusion: 该框架提供了可解释的知识迁移路径，并通过监督微调将推理过程提炼为紧凑的开放模型，实现高效部署。

Abstract: Urban forecasting models often face a severe data imbalance problem: only a
few cities have dense, long-span records, while many others expose short or
incomplete histories. Direct transfer from data-rich to data-scarce cities is
unreliable because only a limited subset of source patterns truly benefits the
target domain, whereas indiscriminate transfer risks introducing noise and
negative transfer. We present STRATA-TS (Selective TRAnsfer via TArget-aware
retrieval for Time Series), a framework that combines domain-adapted retrieval
with reasoning-capable large models to improve forecasting in scarce data
regimes. STRATA-TS employs a patch-based temporal encoder to identify source
subsequences that are semantically and dynamically aligned with the target
query. These retrieved exemplars are then injected into a retrieval-guided
reasoning stage, where an LLM performs structured inference over target inputs
and retrieved support. To enable efficient deployment, we distill the reasoning
process into a compact open model via supervised fine-tuning. Extensive
experiments on three parking availability datasets across Singapore,
Nottingham, and Glasgow demonstrate that STRATA-TS consistently outperforms
strong forecasting and transfer baselines, while providing interpretable
knowledge transfer pathways.

TL;DR: BDVAE是一种新型深度生成模型，通过整合转录组和基因组数据，利用模块化编码器架构和变分推断学习具有生物学意义的潜在特征，准确预测免疫检查点抑制剂治疗反应并揭示耐药机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 免疫检查点抑制剂治疗反应存在高度变异性，现有机器学习模型缺乏可解释性且未能有效利用多组学数据的生物学结构，需要开发能够揭示耐药生物学机制的可解释预测模型。

Method: 提出生物解缠变分自编码器(BDVAE)，采用模态和通路特异性编码器的模块化架构，结合变分推断从转录组和基因组数据中学习与免疫、基因组和代谢过程相关的生物学意义潜在特征。

Result: 在366名跨4种癌症类型的患者队列中，BDVAE准确预测治疗反应(测试数据AUC-ROC=0.94)，揭示免疫抑制、代谢转变和神经元信号等关键耐药机制，发现耐药存在于连续生物学谱系而非严格二元状态。

Conclusion: BDVAE证明了生物结构化机器学习在阐明复杂耐药模式和指导精准免疫治疗策略方面的价值，能够产生可解释且临床相关的生物学见解。

Abstract: Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have transformed cancer treatment, yet
patient responses remain highly variable, and the biological mechanisms
underlying resistance are poorly understood. While machine learning models hold
promise for predicting responses to ICIs, most existing methods lack
interpretability and do not effectively leverage the biological structure
inherent to multi-omics data. Here, we introduce the Biologically Disentangled
Variational Autoencoder (BDVAE), a deep generative model that integrates
transcriptomic and genomic data through modality- and pathway-specific
encoders. Unlike existing rigid, pathway-informed models, BDVAE employs a
modular encoder architecture combined with variational inference to learn
biologically meaningful latent features associated with immune, genomic, and
metabolic processes. Applied to a pan-cancer cohort of 366 patients across four
cancer types treated with ICIs, BDVAE accurately predicts treatment response
(AUC-ROC = 0.94 on unseen test data) and uncovers critical resistance
mechanisms, including immune suppression, metabolic shifts, and neuronal
signaling. Importantly, BDVAE reveals that resistance spans a continuous
biological spectrum rather than strictly binary states, reflecting gradations
of tumor dysfunction. Several latent features correlate with survival outcomes
and known clinical subtypes, demonstrating BDVAE's capability to generate
interpretable, clinically relevant insights. These findings underscore the
value of biologically structured machine learning in elucidating complex
resistance patterns and guiding precision immunotherapy strategies.

Motivation: 金融市场中的信息不对称问题，特别是经过策略性构建的企业叙述，削弱了传统文本分析的有效性，需要新的方法来识别隐藏的企业不确定性

Result: 多模态特征虽然不能预测股票方向性收益，但能解释43.8%的30天实现波动率样本外方差。波动率预测主要受高管从脚本到自发讲话过渡期间的情感动态驱动，特别是CFO的文本稳定性降低和声学不稳定性增加，以及CEO的显著唤醒度变化

Conclusion: 通过从可验证的生物特征信号解码不确定性潜在标记，该方法为投资者和监管机构提供了增强市场可解释性和识别隐藏企业不确定性的强大工具，多模态方法显著优于仅使用财务数据的基准模型

Abstract: Information asymmetry in financial markets, often amplified by strategically
crafted corporate narratives, undermines the effectiveness of conventional
textual analysis. We propose a novel multimodal framework for financial risk
assessment that integrates textual sentiment with paralinguistic cues derived
from executive vocal tract dynamics in earnings calls. Central to this
framework is the Physics-Informed Acoustic Model (PIAM), which applies
nonlinear acoustics to robustly extract emotional signatures from raw
teleconference sound subject to distortions such as signal clipping. Both
acoustic and textual emotional states are projected onto an interpretable
three-dimensional Affective State Label (ASL) space-Tension, Stability, and
Arousal. Using a dataset of 1,795 earnings calls (approximately 1,800 hours),
we construct features capturing dynamic shifts in executive affect between
scripted presentation and spontaneous Q&A exchanges. Our key finding reveals a
pronounced divergence in predictive capacity: while multimodal features do not
forecast directional stock returns, they explain up to 43.8% of the
out-of-sample variance in 30-day realized volatility. Importantly, volatility
predictions are strongly driven by emotional dynamics during executive
transitions from scripted to spontaneous speech, particularly reduced textual
stability and heightened acoustic instability from CFOs, and significant
arousal variability from CEOs. An ablation study confirms that our multimodal
approach substantially outperforms a financials-only baseline, underscoring the
complementary contributions of acoustic and textual modalities. By decoding
latent markers of uncertainty from verifiable biometric signals, our
methodology provides investors and regulators a powerful tool for enhancing
market interpretability and identifying hidden corporate uncertainty.

Conclusion: FFT MoE通过MoE适配器和异质性感知路由机制，有效解决了联邦微调中的异构性问题，为隐私保护的分布式模型适应提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: As FMs drive progress toward Artificial General Intelligence (AGI),
fine-tuning them under privacy and resource constraints has become increasingly
critical particularly when highquality training data resides on distributed
edge devices. Federated Learning (FL) offers a compelling solution through
Federated Fine-Tuning (FFT), which enables collaborative model adaptation
without sharing raw data. Recent approaches incorporate Parameter-Efficient
Fine-Tuning (PEFT) techniques such as Low Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to reduce
computational overhead. However, LoRA-based FFT faces two major limitations in
heterogeneous FL environments: structural incompatibility across clients with
varying LoRA configurations and limited adaptability to non-IID data
distributions, which hinders convergence and generalization. To address these
challenges, we propose FFT MoE, a novel FFT framework that replaces LoRA with
sparse Mixture of Experts (MoE) adapters. Each client trains a lightweight
gating network to selectively activate a personalized subset of experts,
enabling fine-grained adaptation to local resource budgets while preserving
aggregation compatibility. To further combat the expert load imbalance caused
by device and data heterogeneity, we introduce a heterogeneity-aware auxiliary
loss that dynamically regularizes the routing distribution to ensure expert
diversity and balanced utilization. Extensive experiments spanning both IID and
non-IID conditions demonstrate that FFT MoE consistently outperforms state of
the art FFT baselines in generalization performance and training efficiency.

Conclusion: 现有近似机器学习遗忘方法对差分隐私模型的保留样本存在隐私风险，需要开发专门的差分隐私遗忘算法来确保数据隐私保护。

Abstract: Approximate machine unlearning aims to remove the effect of specific data
from trained models to ensure individuals' privacy. Existing methods focus on
the removed records and assume the retained ones are unaffected. However,
recent studies on the \emph{privacy onion effect} indicate this assumption
might be incorrect. Especially when the model is differentially private, no
study has explored whether the retained ones still meet the differential
privacy (DP) criterion under existing machine unlearning methods. This paper
takes a holistic approach to auditing both unlearned and retained samples'
privacy risks after applying approximate unlearning algorithms. We propose the
privacy criteria for unlearned and retained samples, respectively, based on the
perspectives of DP and membership inference attacks (MIAs). To make the
auditing process more practical, we also develop an efficient MIA, A-LiRA,
utilizing data augmentation to reduce the cost of shadow model training. Our
experimental findings indicate that existing approximate machine unlearning
algorithms may inadvertently compromise the privacy of retained samples for
differentially private models, and we need differentially private unlearning
algorithms. For reproducibility, we have pubished our code:

Conclusion: MoE稀疏性对记忆和推理能力有不同影响，推理缺陷无法通过后训练或额外计算补救，需要重新思考MoE缩放定律

Abstract: Empirical scaling laws have driven the evolution of large language models
(LLMs), yet their coefficients shift whenever the model architecture or data
pipeline changes. Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models, now standard in
state-of-the-art systems, introduce a new sparsity dimension that current
dense-model frontiers overlook. We investigate how MoE sparsity influences two
distinct capability regimes: memorization and reasoning. We train families of
MoE Transformers that systematically vary total parameters, active parameters,
and top-$k$ routing while holding the compute budget fixed. For every model we
record pre-training loss, downstream task loss, and task accuracy, allowing us
to separate the train-test generalization gap from the loss-accuracy gap.
Memorization benchmarks improve monotonically with total parameters, mirroring
training loss. By contrast, reasoning performance saturates and can even
regress despite continued gains in both total parameters and training loss.
Altering top-$k$ alone has little effect when active parameters are constant,
and classic hyperparameters such as learning rate and initialization modulate
the generalization gap in the same direction as sparsity. Neither post-training
reinforcement learning (GRPO) nor extra test-time compute rescues the reasoning
deficit of overly sparse models. Our model checkpoints, code and logs are
open-source at https://github.com/rioyokotalab/optimal-sparsity.

Abstract: Automated tabular understanding and reasoning are essential tasks for data
scientists. Recently, Large language models (LLMs) have become increasingly
prevalent in tabular reasoning tasks. Previous work focuses on (1) finetuning
LLMs using labeled data or (2) Training-free prompting LLM agents using
chain-of-thought (CoT). Finetuning offers dataset-specific learning at the cost
of generalizability. Training-free prompting is highly generalizable but does
not take full advantage of training data. In this paper, we propose a novel
prompting-based reasoning approach, Learn then Retrieve: LRTab, which
integrates the benefits of both by retrieving relevant information learned from
training data. We first use prompting to obtain CoT responses over the training
data. For incorrect CoTs, we prompt the LLM to predict Prompt Conditions to
avoid the error, learning insights from the data. We validate the effectiveness
of Prompt Conditions using validation data. Finally, at inference time, we
retrieve the most relevant Prompt Conditions for additional context for table
understanding. We provide comprehensive experiments on WikiTQ and Tabfact,
showing that LRTab is interpretable, cost-efficient, and can outperform
previous baselines in tabular reasoning.

*Hejiang Cai,Di Wu,Ji Xu,Xiang Liu,Yiziting Zhu,Xin Shu,Yujie Li,Bin Yi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出端到端深度学习框架，结合自编码器和多层感知机，用于ICU脓毒症早期检测，在三个ICU队列中准确率分别达到74.6%、80.6%和93.5%，优于传统机器学习方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统机器学习方法依赖手动特征工程，难以处理电子健康记录中不规则、不完整的时间序列数据，需要开发更有效的脓毒症早期检测方法

Method: 集成无监督自编码器进行自动特征提取和多层感知机分类器的端到端深度学习框架，采用定制下采样策略和动态滑动窗口机制，处理带缺失指示符的固定维度向量

Result: 在三个ICU队列中分别获得74.6%、80.6%和93.5%的准确率，显著优于Naive Bayes、SVM、Random Forest和XGBoost等传统方法

Conclusion: 该框架展现出优异的鲁棒性、泛化能力和临床实用性，适用于异构ICU环境中的早期脓毒症检测

Abstract: Sepsis is a life threatening condition that requires timely detection in
intensive care settings. Traditional machine learning approaches, including
Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest, and XGBoost, often
rely on manual feature engineering and struggle with irregular, incomplete
time-series data commonly present in electronic health records. We introduce an
end-to-end deep learning framework integrating an unsupervised autoencoder for
automatic feature extraction with a multilayer perceptron classifier for binary
sepsis risk prediction. To enhance clinical applicability, we implement a
customized down sampling strategy that extracts high information density
segments during training and a non-overlapping dynamic sliding window mechanism
for real-time inference. Preprocessed time series data are represented as fixed
dimension vectors with explicit missingness indicators, mitigating bias and
noise. We validate our approach on three ICU cohorts. Our end-to-end model
achieves accuracies of 74.6 percent, 80.6 percent, and 93.5 percent,
respectively, consistently outperforming traditional machine learning
baselines. These results demonstrate the framework's superior robustness,
generalizability, and clinical utility for early sepsis detection across
heterogeneous ICU environments.

*V. S. Usatyuk,D. A. Sapoznikov,S. I. Egorov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一个结合统计物理、编码理论和代数拓扑的统一框架，用于高效多类图像分类。通过将高维特征向量解释为稀疏LDPC图上的自旋，在Nishimori温度下运行随机键Ising模型，实现最大类可分性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决高维特征压缩和分类效率问题，通过物理启发的拓扑方法设计高效嵌入，在保持高性能的同时大幅减少参数数量。

Method: 使用冻结MobileNetV2提取特征，构建MET-QC-LDPC图形成随机键Ising模型，在Nishimori温度下运行。利用拓扑指导设计球形和环形图结构，通过永久性边界抑制有害陷阱集。

Result: 在ImageNet-10上达到98.7%准确率，ImageNet-100上达到82.7%准确率，压缩比达40倍（1280维特征压缩至32-64维），计算速度提升6倍。

Conclusion: 拓扑指导的图设计能够产生高效、物理启发的嵌入，在保持最先进性能的同时实现大规模特征压缩，为多类分类提供了新的理论框架和实用算法。

Abstract: We present a unified framework combining statistical physics, coding theory,
and algebraic topology for efficient multi-class image classification.
High-dimensional feature vectors from a frozen MobileNetV2 backbone are
interpreted as spins on a sparse Multi-Edge Type quasi-cyclic LDPC
(MET-QC-LDPC) graph, forming a Random-Bond Ising Model (RBIM). We operate this
RBIM at its Nishimori temperature, $\beta_N$, where the smallest eigenvalue of
the Bethe-Hessian matrix vanishes, maximizing class separability.
  Our theoretical contribution establishes a correspondence between local
trapping sets in the code's graph and topological invariants (Betti numbers,
bordism classes) of the feature manifold. A practical algorithm estimates
$\beta_N$ efficiently with a quadratic interpolant and Newton correction,
achieving a six-fold speed-up over bisection.
  Guided by topology, we design spherical and toroidal MET-QC-LDPC graph
ensembles, using permanent bounds to suppress harmful trapping sets. This
compresses 1280-dimensional features to 32 or 64 dimensions for ImageNet-10 and
-100 subsets. Despite massive compression (40x fewer parameters), we achieve
98.7% accuracy on ImageNet-10 and 82.7% on ImageNet-100, demonstrating that
topology-guided graph design yields highly efficient, physics-inspired
embeddings with state-of-the-art performance.

TL;DR: StructRTL是一个新颖的结构感知图自监督学习框架，通过从控制数据流图(CDFG)中学习结构感知表示，显著提升了RTL设计质量估计性能，并结合知识蒸馏策略实现了最先进的结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于大语言模型的方法忽略了RTL代码的结构语义，而CDFG视图能够更明确地暴露设计结构特征，为表示学习提供更丰富的线索。

Method: 提出结构感知图自监督学习框架StructRTL，从CDFG中学习结构感知表示，并采用知识蒸馏策略将后映射网表中的低级洞察转移到CDFG预测器中。

Result: 该方法在各种质量估计任务上显著优于现有技术，建立了新的最先进结果。

Conclusion: 结合结构学习和跨阶段监督的方法在RTL设计质量估计中表现出色，证明了结构感知表示学习与知识蒸馏相结合的有效性。

Abstract: Estimating the quality of register transfer level (RTL) designs is crucial in
the electronic design automation (EDA) workflow, as it enables instant feedback
on key metrics like area and delay without the need for time-consuming logic
synthesis. While recent approaches have leveraged large language models (LLMs)
to derive embeddings from RTL code and achieved promising results, they
overlook the structural semantics essential for accurate quality estimation. In
contrast, the control data flow graph (CDFG) view exposes the design's
structural characteristics more explicitly, offering richer cues for
representation learning. In this work, we introduce a novel structure-aware
graph self-supervised learning framework, StructRTL, for improved RTL design
quality estimation. By learning structure-informed representations from CDFGs,
our method significantly outperforms prior art on various quality estimation
tasks. To further boost performance, we incorporate a knowledge distillation
strategy that transfers low-level insights from post-mapping netlists into the
CDFG predictor. Experiments show that our approach establishes new
state-of-the-art results, demonstrating the effectiveness of combining
structural learning with cross-stage supervision.

TL;DR: FLAegis是一个两阶段防御框架，通过符号时间序列变换和谱聚类检测拜占庭客户端，并使用FFT聚合函数增强联邦学习系统的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习的去中心化特性限制了训练过程的可见性，依赖客户端诚实性，这为恶意拜占庭客户端提供了攻击机会，可能通过提交虚假模型更新来毒化训练过程。

Method: 采用两阶段防御框架：1）使用符号时间序列变换（SAX）放大良性模型与恶意模型之间的差异；2）应用谱聚类准确检测对抗行为；3）集成基于FFT的鲁棒聚合函数作为最终防护层。

Result: 在五种投毒攻击（从简单标签翻转到自适应优化策略）的严格评估中，该方法在检测精度和最终模型准确性方面均优于最先进的防御方法，即使在强对抗条件下也能保持持续高性能。

Conclusion: FLAegis框架有效提升了联邦学习系统对拜占庭攻击的防御能力，通过多阶段检测和聚合机制确保了系统的安全性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has become a powerful technique for training Machine
Learning (ML) models in a decentralized manner, preserving the privacy of the
training datasets involved. However, the decentralized nature of FL limits the
visibility of the training process, relying heavily on the honesty of
participating clients. This assumption opens the door to malicious third
parties, known as Byzantine clients, which can poison the training process by
submitting false model updates. Such malicious clients may engage in poisoning
attacks, manipulating either the dataset or the model parameters to induce
misclassification. In response, this study introduces FLAegis, a two-stage
defensive framework designed to identify Byzantine clients and improve the
robustness of FL systems. Our approach leverages symbolic time series
transformation (SAX) to amplify the differences between benign and malicious
models, and spectral clustering, which enables accurate detection of
adversarial behavior. Furthermore, we incorporate a robust FFT-based
aggregation function as a final layer to mitigate the impact of those Byzantine
clients that manage to evade prior defenses. We rigorously evaluate our method
against five poisoning attacks, ranging from simple label flipping to adaptive
optimization-based strategies. Notably, our approach outperforms
state-of-the-art defenses in both detection precision and final model accuracy,
maintaining consistently high performance even under strong adversarial
conditions.

*Enoch H. Kang,Kyoungseok Jang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文分析了离线强化学习和离线逆强化学习中的Bellman残差最小化(BRM)方法，通过引入Lyapunov势函数证明了SGDA算法在相邻数据集上的稳定性，获得了O(1/n)的平均参数稳定性界限和超额风险界限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前离线强化学习和离线逆强化学习实践中难以有效执行Bellman一致性，虽然Bellman残差最小化(BRM)方法已被提出，但其在离线设置中的统计行为尚未得到充分研究。

Method: 引入单个Lyapunov势函数来耦合相邻数据集上的SGDA运行，分析随机梯度下降-上升(SGDA)算法在BRM问题中的稳定性，适用于标准神经网络参数化和小批量SGD。

Result: 获得了O(1/n)的平均参数稳定性界限，将凸-凹鞍点问题的样本复杂度指数提高了一倍；同时得到O(1/n)的超额风险界限，无需方差缩减、额外正则化或对minibatch采样的严格独立性假设。

Conclusion: 该研究填补了BRM方法在离线设置中的统计理论空白，为Bellman残差最小化提供了坚实的理论保证，推动了离线强化学习算法的发展。

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning and offline inverse reinforcement learning aim
to recover near-optimal value functions or reward models from a fixed batch of
logged trajectories, yet current practice still struggles to enforce Bellman
consistency. Bellman residual minimization (BRM) has emerged as an attractive
remedy, as a globally convergent stochastic gradient descent-ascent based
method for BRM has been recently discovered. However, its statistical behavior
in the offline setting remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we close this
statistical gap. Our analysis introduces a single Lyapunov potential that
couples SGDA runs on neighbouring datasets and yields an O(1/n) on-average
argument-stability bound-doubling the best known sample-complexity exponent for
convex-concave saddle problems. The same stability constant translates into the
O(1/n) excess risk bound for BRM, without variance reduction, extra
regularization, or restrictive independence assumptions on minibatch sampling.
The results hold for standard neural-network parameterizations and minibatch
SGD.

TL;DR: 提出基于约束缩减的混合整数线性规划模型简化方法，通过识别关键紧约束并转换为等式来加速求解，相比现有方法提升解质量50%以上，减少计算时间17.47%


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型简化方法主要基于变量缩减，而约束缩减这一对偶视角被忽视。约束缩减通过将不等式约束转换为等式来降低MILP复杂度，但面临识别关键约束和高效预测的挑战

Method: 首先标记最优解处的紧约束作为潜在关键约束，设计启发式规则选择关键子集；提出多模态表示技术，利用实例级和抽象级MILP公式信息来学习关键紧约束

Result: 实验结果表明，相比最先进方法，该方法提升解质量超过50%，减少计算时间17.47%

Conclusion: 约束基模型缩减方法有效解决了MILP问题，证明了约束缩减在加速求解中的重要价值，为大规模MILP问题提供了新的解决方案

Abstract: Model reduction, which aims to learn a simpler model of the original mixed
integer linear programming (MILP), can solve large-scale MILP problems much
faster. Most existing model reduction methods are based on variable reduction,
which predicts a solution value for a subset of variables. From a dual
perspective, constraint reduction that transforms a subset of inequality
constraints into equalities can also reduce the complexity of MILP, but has
been largely ignored. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel constraint-based
model reduction approach for the MILP. Constraint-based MILP reduction has two
challenges: 1) which inequality constraints are critical such that reducing
them can accelerate MILP solving while preserving feasibility, and 2) how to
predict these critical constraints efficiently. To identify critical
constraints, we first label these tight-constraints at the optimal solution as
potential critical constraints and design a heuristic rule to select a subset
of critical tight-constraints. To learn the critical tight-constraints, we
propose a multi-modal representation technique that leverages information from
both instance-level and abstract-level MILP formulations. The experimental
results show that, compared to the state-of-the-art methods, our method
improves the quality of the solution by over 50\% and reduces the computation
time by 17.47\%.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: UltraMemV2是一种改进的内存层架构，通过五项关键改进实现了与8专家MoE模型相当的性能，同时显著降低了内存访问成本，在内存密集型任务上表现尤为出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的内存层架构（如UltraMem）只能匹配2专家MoE模型的性能，远落后于最先进的8专家配置，存在性能差距。Mixture of Experts模型虽然效率高但内存访问成本高，需要更好的替代方案。

Method: 1) 在每个transformer块中集成内存层；2) 使用单线性投影简化值扩展；3) 采用基于FFN的值处理（PEER方法）；4) 实施原则性参数初始化；5) 重新平衡内存到FFN的计算比例

Result: UltraMemV2在相同计算和参数条件下实现了与8专家MoE模型的性能对等，内存访问显著降低。在内存密集型任务上表现优异：长上下文记忆+1.6分，多轮记忆+6.2分，上下文学习+7.9分。验证了激活密度比稀疏参数总数对性能影响更大。

Conclusion: UltraMemV2使内存层架构达到了与最先进MoE模型相当的性能水平，为高效稀疏计算提供了一个有吸引力的替代方案，特别适合内存密集型应用场景。

Abstract: While Mixture of Experts (MoE) models achieve remarkable efficiency by
activating only subsets of parameters, they suffer from high memory access
costs during inference. Memory-layer architectures offer an appealing
alternative with very few memory access, but previous attempts like UltraMem
have only matched the performance of 2-expert MoE models, falling significantly
short of state-of-the-art 8-expert configurations. We present UltraMemV2, a
redesigned memory-layer architecture that closes this performance gap. Our
approach introduces five key improvements: integrating memory layers into every
transformer block, simplifying value expansion with single linear projections,
adopting FFN-based value processing from PEER, implementing principled
parameter initialization, and rebalancing memory-to-FFN computation ratios.
Through extensive evaluation, we demonstrate that UltraMemV2 achieves
performance parity with 8-expert MoE models under same computation and
parameters but significantly low memory access. Notably, UltraMemV2 shows
superior performance on memory-intensive tasks, with improvements of +1.6
points on long-context memorization, +6.2 points on multi-round memorization,
and +7.9 points on in-context learning. We validate our approach at scale with
models up to 2.5B activated parameters from 120B total parameters, and
establish that activation density has greater impact on performance than total
sparse parameter count. Our work brings memory-layer architectures to
performance parity with state-of-the-art MoE models, presenting a compelling
alternative for efficient sparse computation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了Governance-as-a-Service (GaaS)框架，作为分布式AI系统的运行时治理层，通过声明式规则和信任评分机制来强制执行策略，而不需要修改模型内部结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI系统向分布式生态系统发展，现有监督机制存在反应性、脆弱性和嵌入式问题，缺乏可扩展、解耦的治理结构，存在系统性风险。

Method: GaaS采用模块化、策略驱动的执行层，使用声明式规则和信任因子机制对代理进行评分，支持强制、规范和自适应干预，实现分级执行和动态信任调节。

Result: 在三个模拟场景中使用开源模型进行测试，结果显示GaaS能可靠地阻止或重定向高风险行为，同时保持吞吐量，信任分数能有效跟踪规则遵守情况。

Conclusion: GaaS将治理定位为运行时服务，为可互操作的代理生态系统建立了基础设施级别的对齐机制，不是教导代理伦理，而是强制执行伦理规范。

Abstract: As AI systems evolve into distributed ecosystems with autonomous execution,
asynchronous reasoning, and multi-agent coordination, the absence of scalable,
decoupled governance poses a structural risk. Existing oversight mechanisms are
reactive, brittle, and embedded within agent architectures, making them
non-auditable and hard to generalize across heterogeneous deployments.
  We introduce Governance-as-a-Service (GaaS): a modular, policy-driven
enforcement layer that regulates agent outputs at runtime without altering
model internals or requiring agent cooperation. GaaS employs declarative rules
and a Trust Factor mechanism that scores agents based on compliance and
severity-weighted violations. It enables coercive, normative, and adaptive
interventions, supporting graduated enforcement and dynamic trust modulation.
  To evaluate GaaS, we conduct three simulation regimes with open-source models
(LLaMA3, Qwen3, DeepSeek-R1) across content generation and financial
decision-making. In the baseline, agents act without governance; in the second,
GaaS enforces policies; in the third, adversarial agents probe robustness. All
actions are intercepted, evaluated, and logged for analysis. Results show that
GaaS reliably blocks or redirects high-risk behaviors while preserving
throughput. Trust scores track rule adherence, isolating and penalizing
untrustworthy components in multi-agent systems.
  By positioning governance as a runtime service akin to compute or storage,
GaaS establishes infrastructure-level alignment for interoperable agent
ecosystems. It does not teach agents ethics; it enforces them.

TL;DR: 本文研究联邦学习中客户端标签集异构性问题，比较了公开标签集和私有标签集设置下的模型性能，提出了标准FL方法的适配方案，在保持隐私的同时实现了与公开设置相似的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实应用中客户端标签集异构性很常见但研究较少，特别是当客户端只与中央服务器共享私有标签集时，这给学习算法带来了额外约束，是一个更困难的问题。

Method: 应用分类器组合问题的经典方法进行集中调优，将常见FL方法适配到私有标签集设置，并在实际假设下讨论两种方法的合理性。

Result: 实验显示减少每个客户端可用标签数量会显著损害所有方法的性能。集中调优客户端模型进行表示对齐可以缓解这个问题，但通常以更高方差为代价。提出的标准FL方法适配方案在私有标签设置下表现良好，性能与标准方法在公开设置下相当。

Conclusion: 客户端可以在几乎不损失模型准确性的情况下享受更高的隐私保护，标准FL方法的适配方案在私有标签设置下表现出色。

Abstract: Although common in real-world applications, heterogeneous client label sets
are rarely investigated in federated learning (FL). Furthermore, in the cases
they are, clients are assumed to be willing to share their entire label sets
with other clients. Federated learning with private label sets, shared only
with the central server, adds further constraints on learning algorithms and
is, in general, a more difficult problem to solve. In this work, we study the
effects of label set heterogeneity on model performance, comparing the public
and private label settings -- when the union of label sets in the federation is
known to clients and when it is not. We apply classical methods for the
classifier combination problem to FL using centralized tuning, adapt common FL
methods to the private label set setting, and discuss the justification of both
approaches under practical assumptions. Our experiments show that reducing the
number of labels available to each client harms the performance of all methods
substantially. Centralized tuning of client models for representational
alignment can help remedy this, but often at the cost of higher variance.
Throughout, our proposed adaptations of standard FL methods perform well,
showing similar performance in the private label setting as the standard
methods achieve in the public setting. This shows that clients can enjoy
increased privacy at little cost to model accuracy.

Conclusion: SWiFT提供了一种高效、低成本的模型去偏解决方案，在医疗AI领域具有重要应用价值，能够同时提升模型公平性和性能。

Abstract: Recent studies have shown that Machine Learning (ML) models can exhibit bias
in real-world scenarios, posing significant challenges in ethically sensitive
domains such as healthcare. Such bias can negatively affect model fairness,
model generalization abilities and further risks amplifying social
discrimination. There is a need to remove biases from trained models. Existing
debiasing approaches often necessitate access to original training data and
need extensive model retraining; they also typically exhibit trade-offs between
model fairness and discriminative performance. To address these challenges, we
propose Soft-Mask Weight Fine-Tuning (SWiFT), a debiasing framework that
efficiently improves fairness while preserving discriminative performance with
much less debiasing costs. Notably, SWiFT requires only a small external
dataset and only a few epochs of model fine-tuning. The idea behind SWiFT is to
first find the relative, and yet distinct, contributions of model parameters to
both bias and predictive performance. Then, a two-step fine-tuning process
updates each parameter with different gradient flows defined by its
contribution. Extensive experiments with three bias sensitive attributes
(gender, skin tone, and age) across four dermatological and two chest X-ray
datasets demonstrate that SWiFT can consistently reduce model bias while
achieving competitive or even superior diagnostic accuracy under common
fairness and accuracy metrics, compared to the state-of-the-art. Specifically,
we demonstrate improved model generalization ability as evidenced by superior
performance on several out-of-distribution (OOD) datasets.

Conclusion: 研究首次证明深度强化学习可以在Android恶意软件领域的动态环境中促进有效的恶意软件检测，并提高对概念漂移的韧性，为恶意软件检测提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Malware detection in real-world settings must deal with evolving threats,
limited labeling budgets, and uncertain predictions. Traditional classifiers,
without additional mechanisms, struggle to maintain performance under concept
drift in malware domains, as their supervised learning formulation cannot
optimize when to defer decisions to manual labeling and adaptation. Modern
malware detection pipelines combine classifiers with monthly active learning
(AL) and rejection mechanisms to mitigate the impact of concept drift. In this
work, we develop a novel formulation of malware detection as a one-step Markov
Decision Process and train a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agent,
simultaneously optimizing sample classification performance and rejecting
high-risk samples for manual labeling. We evaluated the joint detection and
drift mitigation policy learned by the DRL-based Malware Detection (DRMD) agent
through time-aware evaluations on Android malware datasets subject to realistic
drift requiring multi-year performance stability. The policies learned under
these conditions achieve a higher Area Under Time (AUT) performance compared to
standard classification approaches used in the domain, showing improved
resilience to concept drift. Specifically, the DRMD agent achieved a
$5.18\pm5.44$, $14.49\pm12.86$, and $10.06\pm10.81$ average AUT performance
improvement for the classification only, classification with rejection, and
classification with rejection and AL settings, respectively. Our results
demonstrate for the first time that DRL can facilitate effective malware
detection and improved resiliency to concept drift in the dynamic environment
of the Android malware domain.

Result: 理论分析证明算法能达到O(√T)的遗憾上界。仿真实验显示，重用历史物品进行比较比仅比较同时推荐物品能显著降低遗憾

Conclusion: 提出的新模型通过利用用户消费后的比较反馈和历史物品重用，在保持理论保证的同时显著提升了推荐系统的性能表现

Abstract: The contextual duelling bandit problem models adaptive recommender systems,
where the algorithm presents a set of items to the user, and the user's choice
reveals their preference. This setup is well suited for implicit choices users
make when navigating a content platform, but does not capture other possible
comparison queries. Motivated by the fact that users provide more reliable
feedback after consuming items, we propose a new bandit model that can be
described as follows. The algorithm recommends one item per time step; after
consuming that item, the user is asked to compare it with another item chosen
from the user's consumption history. Importantly, in our model, this comparison
item can be chosen without incurring any additional regret, potentially leading
to better performance. However, the regret analysis is challenging because of
the temporal dependency in the user's history. To overcome this challenge, we
first show that the algorithm can construct informative queries provided the
history is rich, i.e., satisfies a certain diversity condition. We then show
that a short initial random exploration phase is sufficient for the algorithm
to accumulate a rich history with high probability. This result, proven via
matrix concentration bounds, yields $O(\sqrt{T})$ regret guarantees.
Additionally, our simulations show that reusing past items for comparisons can
lead to significantly lower regret than only comparing between simultaneously
recommended items.

Abstract: Balancing sensitivity to new tasks and stability for retaining past knowledge
is crucial in continual learning (CL). Recently, sharpness-aware minimization
has proven effective in transfer learning and has also been adopted in
continual learning (CL) to improve memory retention and learning efficiency.
However, relying on zeroth-order sharpness alone may favor sharper minima over
flatter ones in certain settings, leading to less robust and potentially
suboptimal solutions. In this paper, we propose \textbf{C}ontinual
\textbf{Flat}ness (\textbf{C-Flat}), a method that promotes flatter loss
landscapes tailored for CL. C-Flat offers plug-and-play compatibility, enabling
easy integration with minimal modifications to the code pipeline. Besides, we
present a general framework that integrates C-Flat into all major CL paradigms
and conduct comprehensive comparisons with loss-minima optimizers and
flat-minima-based CL methods. Our results show that C-Flat consistently
improves performance across a wide range of settings. In addition, we introduce
C-Flat++, an efficient yet effective framework that leverages selective
flatness-driven promotion, significantly reducing the update cost required by
C-Flat. Extensive experiments across multiple CL methods, datasets, and
scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed
approaches. Code is available at https://github.com/WanNaa/C-Flat.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常依赖静态或一阶因果结构，忽视了因果关系的多阶性和时变特性，无法充分建模现实世界事件序列中的复杂因果依赖。

Method: 提出MOCHA框架，使用时变有向无环图(DAG)建模多阶动态因果关系，通过可学习的结构权重、无环性和稀疏性约束确保结构有效性，采用端到端可微分框架联合进行因果发现和时间点过程建模。

Result: 在真实世界数据集上的大量实验表明，MOCHA不仅在事件预测方面达到了最先进的性能，而且揭示了有意义且可解释的因果结构。

Conclusion: MOCHA成功解决了时间点过程中多阶动态因果关系的发现问题，为建模复杂事件序列提供了有效的框架，在预测准确性和结构可解释性方面都表现出色。

Abstract: Discovering complex causal dependencies in temporal point processes (TPPs) is
critical for modeling real-world event sequences. Existing methods typically
rely on static or first-order causal structures, overlooking the multi-order
and time-varying nature of causal relationships. In this paper, we propose
MOCHA, a novel framework for discovering multi-order dynamic causality in TPPs.
MOCHA characterizes multi-order influences as multi-hop causal paths over a
latent time-evolving graph. To model such dynamics, we introduce a time-varying
directed acyclic graph (DAG) with learnable structural weights, where
acyclicity and sparsity constraints are enforced to ensure structural validity.
We design an end-to-end differentiable framework that jointly models causal
discovery and TPP dynamics, enabling accurate event prediction and revealing
interpretable structures. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets
demonstrate that MOCHA not only achieves state-of-the-art performance in event
prediction, but also reveals meaningful and interpretable causal structures.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HAEPO是一种新的探索性策略优化方法，通过历史聚合和轨迹级概率压缩来改善长时域任务中的探索性能，比PPO、GRPO和DPO等方法表现更好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法如DPO和GRPO在长时域任务中往往限制探索能力，需要一种能够更好利用完整轨迹历史并促进广泛探索的新方法。

Method: HAEPO将每个轨迹压缩为对数概率之和（累积对数似然），应用Plackett-Luce softmax获得与回报成正比的归一化权重，并加入熵正则化和软KL惩罚来稳定训练。

Result: 实验表明HAEPO收敛速度快，探索充分，与真实奖励对齐紧密，在多样化任务中表现优于或等同于PPO、GRPO和DPO。

Conclusion: HAEPO提供了一个稳定且可解释的框架，通过显式利用完整轨迹历史来平衡探索和稳定性。

Abstract: Exploration is essential in modern learning, from reinforcement learning
environments with small neural policies to large language models (LLMs).
Existing work, such as DPO, leverages full sequence log-likelihoods to capture
an entire trajectory of the model's decisions, while methods like GRPO
aggregate per-token ratios into a trajectory-level update. However, both often
limit exploration on long-horizon tasks. We introduce History-Aggregated
Exploratory Policy Optimization (HAEPO), a history-aware exploratory loss to
combat these shortcomings. HAEPO compresses each trajectory into the sum of its
logarithmic probabilities (a cumulative logarithmic likelihood), and applies a
Plackett-Luce softmax across trajectories to obtain normalized weights
proportional to their returns, thus encouraging broader exploration. We add
entropy regularization to stabilize the aggressive updates to prevent premature
collapse and a soft KL penalty relative to a frozen copy of the previous
(reference) policy. Empirically, HAEPO converges fast, explores thoroughly,
aligns closely with true rewards, and demonstrates robust learning behavior
better or at par with PPO, GRPO, and DPO across diverse tasks. Thus, HAEPO
provides a stable and interpretable framework by explicitly leveraging
full-trajectory history while balancing exploration and stability.

Abstract: Modern time series analysis demands frameworks that are flexible, efficient,
and extensible. However, many existing Python libraries exhibit limitations in
modularity and in their native support for irregular, multi-source, or sparse
data. We introduce pyFAST, a research-oriented PyTorch framework that
explicitly decouples data processing from model computation, fostering a
cleaner separation of concerns and facilitating rapid experimentation. Its data
engine is engineered for complex scenarios, supporting multi-source loading,
protein sequence handling, efficient sequence- and patch-level padding, dynamic
normalization, and mask-based modeling for both imputation and forecasting.
pyFAST integrates LLM-inspired architectures for the alignment-free fusion of
sparse data sources and offers native sparse metrics, specialized loss
functions, and flexible exogenous data fusion. Training utilities include
batch-based streaming aggregation for evaluation and device synergy to maximize
computational efficiency. A comprehensive suite of classical and deep learning
models (Linears, CNNs, RNNs, Transformers, and GNNs) is provided within a
modular architecture that encourages extension. Released under the MIT license
at GitHub, pyFAST provides a compact yet powerful platform for advancing time

Method: 引入全局潜在变量建模任务级变化，局部潜在变量捕捉距离保持潜在空间中的输入相似性，通过bi-Lipschitz正则化保持相对距离关系

Result: DNP实现了更好的预测性能和改进的不确定性校准，在回归和分类任务中表现优异

Conclusion: DNP通过全局-局部潜在结构结合和距离保持机制，有效提升了不确定性估计能力和分布内外数据区分能力

Abstract: We propose the Distance-informed Neural Process (DNP), a novel variant of
Neural Processes that improves uncertainty estimation by combining global and
distance-aware local latent structures. Standard Neural Processes (NPs) often
rely on a global latent variable and struggle with uncertainty calibration and
capturing local data dependencies. DNP addresses these limitations by
introducing a global latent variable to model task-level variations and a local
latent variable to capture input similarity within a distance-preserving latent
space. This is achieved through bi-Lipschitz regularization, which bounds
distortions in input relationships and encourages the preservation of relative
distances in the latent space. This modeling approach allows DNP to produce
better-calibrated uncertainty estimates and more effectively distinguish in-
from out-of-distribution data. Empirical results demonstrate that DNP achieves
strong predictive performance and improved uncertainty calibration across
regression and classification tasks.

Abstract: Neural ordinary differential equations (neural ODEs) are a popular type of
deep learning model that operate with continuous-depth architectures. To assess
how well such models perform on unseen data, it is crucial to understand their
generalization error bounds. Previous research primarily focused on the linear
case for the dynamics function in neural ODEs - Marion, P. (2023), or provided
bounds for Neural Controlled ODEs that depend on the sampling interval
Bleistein et al. (2023). In this work, we analyze a broader class of neural
ODEs where the dynamics function is a general nonlinear function, either time
dependent or time independent, and is Lipschitz continuous with respect to the
state variables. We showed that under this Lipschitz condition, the solutions
to neural ODEs have solutions with bounded variations. Based on this
observation, we establish generalization bounds for both time-dependent and
time-independent cases and investigate how overparameterization and domain
constraints influence these bounds. To our knowledge, this is the first
derivation of generalization bounds for neural ODEs with general nonlinear
dynamics.

Abstract: Temporal modeling in complex systems requires capturing dependencies across
multiple time scales while managing inherent uncertainties. We propose
HierCVAE, a novel architecture that integrates hierarchical attention
mechanisms with conditional variational autoencoders to address these
challenges. HierCVAE employs a three-tier attention structure (local, global,
cross-temporal) combined with multi-modal condition encoding to capture
temporal, statistical, and trend information. The approach incorporates
ResFormer blocks in the latent space and provides explicit uncertainty
quantification via prediction heads. Through evaluations on energy consumption
datasets, HierCVAE demonstrates a 15-40% improvement in prediction accuracy and
superior uncertainty calibration compared to state-of-the-art methods,
excelling in long-term forecasting and complex multi-variate dependencies.

Abstract: Molecular structure generation is a fundamental problem that involves
determining the 3D positions of molecules' constituents. It has crucial
biological applications, such as molecular docking, protein folding, and
molecular design. Recent advances in generative modeling, such as diffusion
models and flow matching, have made great progress on these tasks by modeling
molecular conformations as a distribution. In this work, we focus on flow
matching and adopt an energy-based perspective to improve training and
inference of structure generation models. Our view results in a mapping
function, represented by a deep network, that is directly learned to
\textit{iteratively} map random configurations, i.e. samples from the source
distribution, to target structures, i.e. points in the data manifold. This
yields a conceptually simple and empirically effective flow matching setup that
is theoretically justified and has interesting connections to fundamental
properties such as idempotency and stability, as well as the empirically useful
techniques such as structure refinement in AlphaFold. Experiments on protein
docking as well as protein backbone generation consistently demonstrate the
method's effectiveness, where it outperforms recent baselines of
task-associated flow matching and diffusion models, using a similar
computational budget.

Motivation: 多标签数据分析前需要评估标签间的依赖性，但直接从标签值测量独立性受到协变量的影响。需要通过条件标签协方差来测量标签依赖性。

Method: 比较三种模型：多元Probit模型、多元Bernoulli模型和分段Logit模型在估计常数协方差和依赖性协方差方面的性能。通过实验观察各模型对条件协方差的测量结果。

Result: 所有模型在估计常数和依赖性协方差方面表现相似，但都存在偏误检测问题：当存在常数协方差时，模型会误判为存在依赖性协方差。多元Probit模型的错误率最低。

Conclusion: 对于多标签数据标签依赖性分析，三种模型都能有效测量协方差，但需要注意它们都存在偏误检测依赖性的问题。多元Probit模型是三者中最优的选择。

Abstract: Multilabel data should be analysed for label dependence before applying
multilabel models. Independence between multilabel data labels cannot be
measured directly from the label values due to their dependence on the set of
covariates $\vec{x}$, but can be measured by examining the conditional label
covariance using a multivariate Probit model. Unfortunately, the multivariate
Probit model provides an estimate of its copula covariance, and so might not be
reliable in estimating constant covariance and dependent covariance. In this
article, we compare three models (Multivariate Probit, Multivariate Bernoulli
and Staged Logit) for estimating the constant and dependent multilabel
conditional label covariance. We provide an experiment that allows us to
observe each model's measurement of conditional covariance. We found that all
models measure constant and dependent covariance equally well, depending on the
strength of the covariance, but the models all falsely detect that dependent
covariance is present for data where constant covariance is present. Of the
three models, the Multivariate Probit model had the lowest error rate.

Abstract: This paper investigates the generalisability of Koopman-based representations
for chaotic dynamical systems, focusing on their transferability across
prediction and control tasks. Using the Lorenz system as a testbed, we propose
a three-stage methodology: learning Koopman embeddings through autoencoding,
pre-training a transformer on next-state prediction, and fine-tuning for
safety-critical control. Our results show that Koopman embeddings outperform
both standard and physics-informed PCA baselines, achieving accurate and
data-efficient performance. Notably, fixing the pre-trained transformer weights
during fine-tuning leads to no performance degradation, indicating that the
learned representations capture reusable dynamical structure rather than
task-specific patterns. These findings support the use of Koopman embeddings as
a foundation for multi-task learning in physics-informed machine learning. A

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前时间序列预测模型普遍不透明，缺乏对其预测结果的解释能力，而现有的后处理可解释性方法（如LIME）不适用于预测场景，因此需要开发专门的时间序列预测可解释性方法。

Result: 在7种算法和10个不同数据集上的基准测试表明，PAX-TS能够有效捕捉模型行为，高性能和低性能算法的解释存在明显差异。通过时间步相关矩阵识别出6类重复出现的模式，这些模式是性能指标，不同类别之间存在显著的预测误差差异。

Conclusion: PAX-TS能够以不同详细程度说明时间序列预测模型的机制，其解释可用于回答关于预测的实际问题，为时间序列预测模型提供了有效的可解释性解决方案。

Abstract: Time series forecasting has seen considerable improvement during the last
years, with transformer models and large language models driving advancements
of the state of the art. Modern forecasting models are generally opaque and do
not provide explanations for their forecasts, while well-known post-hoc
explainability methods like LIME are not suitable for the forecasting context.
We propose PAX-TS, a model-agnostic post-hoc algorithm to explain time series
forecasting models and their forecasts. Our method is based on localized input
perturbations and results in multi-granular explanations. Further, it is able
to characterize cross-channel correlations for multivariate time series
forecasts. We clearly outline the algorithmic procedure behind PAX-TS,
demonstrate it on a benchmark with 7 algorithms and 10 diverse datasets,
compare it with two other state-of-the-art explanation algorithms, and present
the different explanation types of the method. We found that the explanations
of high-performing and low-performing algorithms differ on the same datasets,
highlighting that the explanations of PAX-TS effectively capture a model's
behavior. Based on time step correlation matrices resulting from the benchmark,
we identify 6 classes of patterns that repeatedly occur across different
datasets and algorithms. We found that the patterns are indicators of
performance, with noticeable differences in forecasting error between the
classes. Lastly, we outline a multivariate example where PAX-TS demonstrates
how the forecasting model takes cross-channel correlations into account. With
PAX-TS, time series forecasting models' mechanisms can be illustrated in
different levels of detail, and its explanations can be used to answer
practical questions on forecasts.

Conclusion: FedProtoKD通过解决原型边缘收缩问题，有效提升了异构联邦学习在非IID数据场景下的性能表现

Abstract: Heterogeneous Federated Learning (HFL) has gained attention for its ability
to accommodate diverse models and heterogeneous data across clients.
Prototype-based HFL methods emerge as a promising solution to address
statistical heterogeneity and privacy challenges, paving the way for new
advancements in HFL research. This method focuses on sharing only
class-representative prototypes among heterogeneous clients. However, these
prototypes are often aggregated on the server using weighted averaging, leading
to sub-optimal global knowledge; these cause the shrinking of aggregated
prototypes, which negatively affects the model performance in scenarios when
models are heterogeneous and data distributions are extremely non-IID. We
propose FedProtoKD in a Heterogeneous Federated Learning setting, using an
enhanced dual-knowledge distillation mechanism to improve the system
performance with clients' logits and prototype feature representation. We aim
to resolve the prototype margin-shrinking problem using a contrastive
learning-based trainable server prototype by leveraging a class-wise adaptive
prototype margin. Furthermore, we assess the importance of public samples using
the closeness of the sample's prototype to its class representative prototypes,
which enhances learning performance. FedProtoKD achieved average improvements
of 1.13% up to 34.13% accuracy across various settings and significantly
outperforms existing state-of-the-art HFL methods.

TL;DR: STDiff是一种基于条件去噪扩散模型的时间序列缺失值填补方法，通过逐步生成缺失值，专注于系统状态演化而非固定时间窗口的模式补全。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统深度学习方法假设在固定时间窗口内完成模式补全，但在工业系统中，动态性受控制动作驱动、高度非平稳，且可能存在长时间连续缺失，这种假设往往失效。

Method: 使用条件去噪扩散模型，具有与控制理论一致的时间因果偏置，基于最近已知状态和相关控制或环境输入，逐步生成缺失值。

Result: 在模拟缺失块的公共污水处理数据集上，STDiff始终获得最低误差，且优势随缺失长度增加而增强；在真实工业数据集上，能产生动态合理的轨迹，而基于窗口的模型往往过度平滑。

Conclusion: 支持动态感知、显式条件化的填补方法作为工业时间序列的稳健方法，并讨论了计算权衡和向更广泛领域的扩展。

Abstract: Most deep learning methods for imputing missing values treat the task as
completing patterns within a fixed time window. This assumption often fails in
industrial systems, where dynamics are driven by control actions, are highly
non-stationary, and can experience long, uninterrupted gaps. We propose STDiff,
which reframes imputation as learning how the system evolves from one state to
the next. STDiff uses a conditional denoising diffusion model with a causal
bias aligned to control theory, generating missing values step-by-step based on
the most recent known state and relevant control or environmental inputs. On a
public wastewater treatment dataset with simulated missing blocks, STDiff
consistently achieves the lowest errors, with its advantage increasing for
longer gaps. On a raw industrial dataset with substantial real gaps, it
produces trajectories that remain dynamically plausible, in contrast to
window-based models that tend to flatten or over-smooth. These results support
dynamics-aware, explicitly conditioned imputation as a robust approach for
industrial time series, and we discuss computational trade-offs and extensions
to broader domains.

Motivation: 从物理角度研究学习过程，通过简单的动力学系统来模拟函数近似和最小化损失函数

Result: 系统在回归任务上表现与多层感知机相似，发现了由环境波动导致的热力学学习障碍

Conclusion: 这个简单模型有助于从物理角度更好地理解学习系统的本质特性

Abstract: Learning is a physical process. Here, we aim to study a simple dynamical
system composed of springs and sticks capable of arbitrarily approximating any
continuous function. The main idea of our work is to use the sticks to mimic a
piecewise-linear approximation of the given function, use the potential energy
of springs to encode a desired mean squared error loss function, and converge
to a minimum-energy configuration via dissipation. We apply the proposed
simulation system to regression tasks and show that its performance is
comparable to that of multi-layer perceptrons. In addition, we study the
thermodynamic properties of the system and find a relation between the free
energy change of the system and its ability to learn an underlying data
distribution. We empirically find a \emph{thermodynamic learning barrier} for
the system caused by the fluctuations of the environment, whereby the system
cannot learn if its change in free energy hits such a barrier. We believe this
simple model can help us better understand learning systems from a physical
point of view.

TL;DR: 该研究从资源中心视角探索预测性流程监控中的下一活动预测，通过评估不同模型和编码策略，发现LightGBM和Transformer模型在2-gram活动转移编码下表现最佳，为资源分配和员工支持提供新思路。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有预测性流程监控研究主要关注控制流视角，而资源信息在下一活动预测中的作用尚未探索。从资源中心视角出发可以提供更好的工作组织、负载平衡和容量预测等额外优势。

Method: 在四个真实数据集上评估了四种预测模型（包括LightGBM、Transformer和随机森林）和三种编码策略（2-gram活动转移、活动重复特征及其组合）。

Result: LightGBM和Transformer模型在2-gram活动转移编码下表现最佳，随机森林在结合2-gram转移和活动重复特征的编码中获益最大，该组合编码实现了最高平均准确率。

Conclusion: 资源中心的下一活动预测方法为智能资源分配、战略性人力规划和个性化员工支持提供了可能，开辟了预测性流程监控研究的新方向。

Abstract: Predictive Process Monitoring (PPM) aims to train models that forecast
upcoming events in process executions. These predictions support early
bottleneck detection, improved scheduling, proactive interventions, and timely
communication with stakeholders. While existing research adopts a control-flow
perspective, we investigate next-activity prediction from a resource-centric
viewpoint, which offers additional benefits such as improved work organization,
workload balancing, and capacity forecasting. Although resource information has
been shown to enhance tasks such as process performance analysis, its role in
next-activity prediction remains unexplored. In this study, we evaluate four
prediction models and three encoding strategies across four real-life datasets.
Compared to the baseline, our results show that LightGBM and Transformer models
perform best with an encoding based on 2-gram activity transitions, while
Random Forest benefits most from an encoding that combines 2-gram transitions
and activity repetition features. This combined encoding also achieves the
highest average accuracy. This resource-centric approach could enable smarter
resource allocation, strategic workforce planning, and personalized employee
support by analyzing individual behavior rather than case-level progression.
The findings underscore the potential of resource-centric next-activity
prediction, opening up new venues for research on PPM.

Conclusion: 为威胜智能和网络防御领域的主动学习流水线选择相似性函数提供了可操作的见解。

Abstract: Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) pose a severe challenge to cyber defense
due to their stealthy behavior and the extreme class imbalance inherent in
detection datasets. To address these issues, we propose a novel active
learning-based anomaly detection framework that leverages similarity search to
iteratively refine the decision space. Built upon an Attention-Based
Autoencoder, our approach uses feature-space similarity to identify normal-like
and anomaly-like instances, thereby enhancing model robustness with minimal
oracle supervision. Crucially, we perform a formal evaluation of various
similarity measures to understand their influence on sample selection and
anomaly ranking effectiveness. Through experiments on diverse datasets,
including DARPA Transparent Computing APT traces, we demonstrate that the
choice of similarity metric significantly impacts model convergence, anomaly
detection accuracy, and label efficiency. Our results offer actionable insights
for selecting similarity functions in active learning pipelines tailored for
threat intelligence and cyber defense.

Motivation: 传统早停方法需要验证集，这会减少训练数据量。梯度下降算法已经免费产生梯度信息，可以利用这些信息来避免使用验证集

Method: 通过梯度信息估计贝叶斯后验分布，将早停问题定义为从该后验中采样，并使用近似后验获得停止准则

Conclusion: GradStop能够利用全部数据集进行训练，特别适合数据有限场景（如迁移学习），可作为梯度下降库的可选功能

Abstract: Machine learning models are often learned by minimising a loss function on
the training data using a gradient descent algorithm. These models often suffer
from overfitting, leading to a decline in predictive performance on unseen
data. A standard solution is early stopping using a hold-out validation set,
which halts the minimisation when the validation loss stops decreasing.
However, this hold-out set reduces the data available for training. This paper
presents {\sc gradstop}, a novel stochastic early stopping method that only
uses information in the gradients, which are produced by the gradient descent
algorithm ``for free.'' Our main contributions are that we estimate the
Bayesian posterior by the gradient information, define the early stopping
problem as drawing sample from this posterior, and use the approximated
posterior to obtain a stopping criterion. Our empirical evaluation shows that
{\sc gradstop} achieves a small loss on test data and compares favourably to a
validation-set-based stopping criterion. By leveraging the entire dataset for
training, our method is particularly advantageous in data-limited settings,
such as transfer learning. It can be incorporated as an optional feature in
gradient descent libraries with only a small computational overhead. The source
code is available at https://github.com/edahelsinki/gradstop.

Result: 发现学习率选择对现代循环模型性能至关重要，可能严重影响先前报告的性能；循环模型和注意力模型在宽度与深度扩展上表现出相反的优势，注意力模型在单层时无法解决关联回忆任务；单层Transformer的训练动态意外地类似于归纳头的形成过程；架构组件分析揭示了不同组件对模型性能和优化稳定性的具体影响。

Conclusion: 现代循环模型的训练需要更深入的研究来稳定化，学习率选择是关键因素；循环模型和注意力模型在架构扩展上具有不同的优势模式；单层Transformer展现出有趣的训练动态现象；架构设计对模型性能和优化稳定性有重要影响，需要进一步研究。

Abstract: Despite the advantageous subquadratic complexity of modern recurrent deep
learning models -- such as state-space models (SSMs) -- recent studies have
highlighted their potential shortcomings compared to transformers on reasoning
and memorization tasks. In this paper, we dive deeper into one of such
benchmarks: associative recall (AR), which has been shown to correlate well
with language modeling performance, and inspect in detail the effects of
scaling and optimization issues in recently proposed token mixing strategies.
We first demonstrate that, unlike standard transformers, the choice of learning
rate plays a critical role in the performance of modern recurrent models: an
issue that can severely affect reported performance in previous works and
suggests further research is needed to stabilize training. Next, we show that
recurrent and attention-based models exhibit contrasting benefits when scaling
in width as opposed to depth, with attention being notably unable to solve AR
when limited to a single layer. We then further inspect 1-layer transformers,
revealing that despite their poor performance, their training dynamics
surprisingly resemble the formation of induction heads, a phenomenon previously
observed only in their 2-layer counterparts. Finally, through architectural
ablations, we study how components affects Transformer and Mamba's performance
and optimization stability.

Motivation: 传统机器学习地震波动预测模型存在黑盒特性和数据不平衡问题，影响高风险决策的可信质性

Method: 使用透明的线性ML架构，每个输入参数独立处理后线性相加，结合HazBinLoss函数给关键近断层大震级记录赋予更高权重

Result: 模型能够捐描已知地震学原理，与现有GMMs相比保持了可比的性能同时具有透明性

Conclusion: 该框架推进了机器学习在地震风险评估和灾害规划中的应用

Abstract: Ground motion models (GMMs) predict how strongly the ground will shake during
an earthquake. They are essential for structural analysis, seismic design, and
seismic risk assessment studies. Traditional machine learning (ML) approaches
are popular to develop GMMs, due to large earthquake databases worldwide.
However, they operate as "black boxes," which are hard to interpret and trust,
limiting their use in high-stake decisions. Additionally, these databases
suffer from significant data imbalances: fewer large, critically damaging
records near the fault compared to abundant, less severely damaging distant
records. These two limitations are addressed in this work by developing a
transparent ML architecture using the HazBinLoss function. Each input (e.g.,
magnitude, distance, their interaction term, etc.) is processed separately and
added linearly to obtain the output, resulting in exact contribution of each
term. The HazBinLoss function assigns higher weights to critical near-field
large magnitude records and lower weights to less-critical far-field smaller
magnitude records, during training to prevent underprediction of the most
damaging scenarios. Our model captures known seismological principles and
achieves comparable performance with established GMMs while maintaining
transparency. This framework enables broader adoption of ML-based approaches
for risk assessment studies and disaster planning.

Motivation: 探索GNN在传统近似角色之外的能力，验证其在数值格式生成方面的潜力，特别是在分布外推和符号发现方面的表现

Method: 使用两节点图训练GNN，结合符号回归分析网络学到的表示；在无监督设置下使用类似PINN的残差损失训练；扩展到2-hop和2层GNN探索高阶格式

Conclusion: GNN不仅是强大的近似器，还能主动贡献于新数值方法的开发，为科学计算开辟了新范式

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have deeply modified the landscape of numerical
simulations by demonstrating strong capabilities in approximating solutions of
physical systems. However, their ability to extrapolate beyond their training
domain (\textit{e.g.} larger or structurally different graphs) remains
uncertain. In this work, we establish that GNNs can serve purposes beyond their
traditional role, and be exploited to generate numerical schemes, in
conjunction with symbolic regression. First, we show numerically and
theoretically that a GNN trained on a dataset consisting solely of two-node
graphs can extrapolate a first-order Finite Volume (FV) scheme for the heat
equation on out-of-distribution, unstructured meshes. Specifically, if a GNN
achieves a loss $\varepsilon$ on such a dataset, it implements the FV scheme
with an error of $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon)$. Using symbolic regression, we show
that the network effectively rediscovers the exact analytical formulation of
the standard first-order FV scheme. We then extend this approach to an
unsupervised context: the GNN recovers the first-order FV scheme using only a
residual loss similar to Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) with no
access to ground-truth data. Finally, we push the methodology further by
considering higher-order schemes: we train (i) a 2-hop and (ii) a 2-layers GNN
using the same PINN loss, that autonomously discover (i) a second-order
correction term to the initial scheme using a 2-hop stencil, and (ii) the
classic second-order midpoint scheme. These findings follows a recent paradigm
in scientific computing: GNNs are not only strong approximators, but can be
active contributors to the development of novel numerical methods.

Motivation: 隐私法规要求从深度学习模型中删除数据，这在联邦学习中尤为困难，因为数据保留在客户端，使得完全重训练或协调更新往往不可行

Method: 将泄漏建模为参数估计问题，利用二阶Hessian信息识别对要遗忘数据最敏感的模型参数，选择性重置这些参数后进行最小化联邦重训练

Result: 在基准数据集上实现强隐私保护（MIA攻击成功率接近随机猜测，类别知识被有效擦除）和高性能（相对于重训练基准的归一化准确率约0.9），在针对性后门攻击场景中有效中和恶意触发器

Conclusion: 为联邦学习中的数据遗忘提供了一个实用的解决方案，在保持模型性能的同时实现高效隐私保护

Abstract: Privacy regulations require the erasure of data from deep learning models.
This is a significant challenge that is amplified in Federated Learning, where
data remains on clients, making full retraining or coordinated updates often
infeasible. This work introduces an efficient Federated Unlearning framework
based on information theory, modeling leakage as a parameter estimation
problem. Our method uses second-order Hessian information to identify and
selectively reset only the parameters most sensitive to the data being
forgotten, followed by minimal federated retraining. This model-agnostic
approach supports categorical and client unlearning without requiring server
access to raw client data after initial information aggregation. Evaluations on
benchmark datasets demonstrate strong privacy (MIA success near random,
categorical knowledge erased) and high performance (Normalized Accuracy against
re-trained benchmarks of $\approx$ 0.9), while aiming for increased efficiency
over complete retraining. Furthermore, in a targeted backdoor attack scenario,
our framework effectively neutralizes the malicious trigger, restoring model
integrity. This offers a practical solution for data forgetting in FL.

Conclusion: TRIGON通过创新的三角形选择和图重布线方法，有效提升了GNN在异质性和同质性图数据上的性能表现。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as the leading paradigm for
learning over graph-structured data. However, their performance is limited by
issues inherent to graph topology, most notably oversquashing and
oversmoothing. Recent advances in graph rewiring aim to mitigate these
limitations by modifying the graph topology to promote more effective
information propagation. In this work, we introduce TRIGON, a novel framework
that constructs enriched, non-planar triangulations by learning to select
relevant triangles from multiple graph views. By jointly optimizing triangle
selection and downstream classification performance, our method produces a
rewired graph with markedly improved structural properties such as reduced
diameter, increased spectral gap, and lower effective resistance compared to
existing rewiring methods. Empirical results demonstrate that TRIGON
outperforms state-of-the-art approaches on node classification tasks across a
range of homophilic and heterophilic benchmarks.

Motivation: 大语言模型计算需求巨大，现有量化方法在GPU上支持有限，存在Tensor Core支持不足、内存管理低效和内核优化不灵活等问题，需要更高效的任意精度加速方案。

Method: 提出bipolar-INT数据格式实现无损转换和并行计算；开发位级矩阵分解重组方法实现任意精度矩阵乘法；设计基于数据恢复的内存管理系统；开发动态内核映射方法优化不同矩阵大小的性能。

Conclusion: APT-LLM通过系统性的硬件优化方法，成功解决了任意精度LLM在GPU上的加速挑战，为高效部署大语言模型提供了有效的技术方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized AI applications, yet their
enormous computational demands severely limit deployment and real-time
performance. Quantization methods can help reduce computational costs, however,
attaining the extreme efficiency associated with ultra-low-bit quantized LLMs
at arbitrary precision presents challenges on GPUs. This is primarily due to
the limited support for GPU Tensor Cores, inefficient memory management, and
inflexible kernel optimizations. To tackle these challenges, we propose a
comprehensive acceleration scheme for arbitrary precision LLMs, namely APT-LLM.
Firstly, we introduce a novel data format, bipolar-INT, which allows for
efficient and lossless conversion with signed INT, while also being more
conducive to parallel computation. We also develop a matrix multiplication
(MatMul) method allowing for arbitrary precision by dismantling and
reassembling matrices at the bit level. This method provides flexible precision
and optimizes the utilization of GPU Tensor Cores. In addition, we propose a
memory management system focused on data recovery, which strategically employs
fast shared memory to substantially increase kernel execution speed and reduce
memory access latency. Finally, we develop a kernel mapping method that
dynamically selects the optimal configurable hyperparameters of kernels for
varying matrix sizes, enabling optimal performance across different LLM
architectures and precision settings. In LLM inference, APT-LLM achieves up to
a 3.99$\times$ speedup compared to FP16 baselines and a 2.16$\times$ speedup
over NVIDIA CUTLASS INT4 acceleration on RTX 3090. On RTX 4090 and H800,
APT-LLM achieves up to 2.44$\times$ speedup over FP16 and 1.65$\times$ speedup
over CUTLASS integer baselines.

Conclusion: 该约束优化框架为扩散模型的校准和组合提供了理论保证和实用算法，能够更好地处理多属性生成中的权衡问题。

Abstract: Diffusion models have become prevalent in generative modeling due to their
ability to sample from complex distributions. To improve the quality of
generated samples and their compliance with user requirements, two commonly
used methods are: (i) Alignment, which involves fine-tuning a diffusion model
to align it with a reward; and (ii) Composition, which combines several
pre-trained diffusion models, each emphasizing a desirable attribute in the
generated outputs. However, trade-offs often arise when optimizing for multiple
rewards or combining multiple models, as they can often represent competing
properties. Existing methods cannot guarantee that the resulting model
faithfully generates samples with all the desired properties. To address this
gap, we propose a constrained optimization framework that unifies alignment and
composition of diffusion models by enforcing that the aligned model satisfies
reward constraints and/or remains close to (potentially multiple) pre-trained
models. We provide a theoretical characterization of the solutions to the
constrained alignment and composition problems and develop a Lagrangian-based
primal-dual training algorithm to approximate these solutions. Empirically, we
demonstrate the effectiveness and merits of our proposed approach in image
generation, applying it to alignment and composition, and show that our aligned
or composed model satisfies constraints effectively, and improves on the
equally-weighted approach. Our implementation can be found at

Conclusion: 结合概率众包建模和主动学习的框架能有效处理噪声人类反馈，提高基于偏好强化学习的效率和效果，特别是在需要专家反馈的领域

Abstract: Preference-based reinforcement learning has gained prominence as a strategy
for training agents in environments where the reward signal is difficult to
specify or misaligned with human intent. However, its effectiveness is often
limited by the high cost and low availability of reliable human input,
especially in domains where expert feedback is scarce or errors are costly. To
address this, we propose a novel framework that combines two complementary
strategies: probabilistic crowd modelling to handle noisy, multi-annotator
feedback, and active learning to prioritize feedback on the most informative
agent actions. We extend the Advise algorithm to support multiple trainers,
estimate their reliability online, and incorporate entropy-based query
selection to guide feedback requests. We evaluate our approach in a set of
environments that span both synthetic and real-world-inspired settings,
including 2D games (Taxi, Pacman, Frozen Lake) and a blood glucose control task
for Type 1 Diabetes using the clinically approved UVA/Padova simulator. Our
preliminary results demonstrate that agents trained with feedback on uncertain
trajectories exhibit faster learning in most tasks, and we outperform the
baselines for the blood glucose control task.

Conclusion: 该研究为密集关联记忆模型提供了理论分析和实用改进，通过正则化和网络增长算法实现了更稳定高效的训练，展示了DAM在分类任务中的良好性能。

Abstract: Dense associative memory (DAM) models have been attracting renewed attention
since they were shown to be robust to adversarial examples and closely related
to state-of-the-art machine learning paradigms, such as the attention
mechanisms in transformers and generative diffusion models. We study a DAM
built upon a three-layer Boltzmann machine with Potts hidden units, which
represent data clusters and classes. Through a statistical mechanics analysis,
we derive saddle-point equations that characterize both the stationary points
of DAMs trained on real data and the fixed points of DAMs trained on synthetic
data within a teacher-student framework. Based on these results, we propose a
novel regularization scheme that makes training significantly more stable.
Moreover, we show empirically that our DAM learns interpretable solutions to
both supervised and unsupervised classification problems. Pushing our
theoretical analysis further, we find that the weights learned by relatively
small DAMs correspond to unstable saddle points in larger DAMs. We implement a
network-growing algorithm that leverages this saddle-point hierarchy to
drastically reduce the computational cost of training dense associative memory.

Abstract: In safety-critical deep learning applications, robustness measures the
ability of neural models that handle imperceptible perturbations in input data,
which may lead to potential safety hazards. Existing pre-deployment robustness
assessment methods typically suffer from significant trade-offs between
computational cost and measurement precision, limiting their practical utility.
To address these limitations, this paper conducts a comprehensive comparative
analysis of existing robustness definitions and associated assessment
methodologies. We propose tower robustness to evaluate robustness, which is a
novel, practical metric based on hypothesis testing to quantitatively evaluate
probabilistic robustness, enabling more rigorous and efficient pre-deployment
assessments. Our extensive comparative evaluation illustrates the advantages
and applicability of our proposed approach, thereby advancing the systematic
understanding and enhancement of model robustness in safety-critical deep

### [161] [Emotions as Ambiguity-aware Ordinal Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19193)
*Jingyao Wu,Matthew Barthet,David Melhart,Georgios N. Yannakakis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的模糊感知序数情感表示框架，通过建模情感模糊性的变化率来捕捉情感标注的模糊性和情感轨迹的时序动态特性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有连续情感识别方法要么忽略情感的模糊性，要么将模糊性视为独立且静态的变量，无法有效处理情感固有的模糊性和动态特性。

Method: 引入模糊感知序数情感表示框架，通过建模情感模糊性的变化率来捕捉情感标注的模糊性和情感轨迹的时序动态。在RECOLA和GameVibe两个情感语料库上进行评估，测试有界（唤醒度、效价）和无界（参与度）连续情感轨迹。

Result: 序数表示在无界标签上优于传统模糊感知模型，获得最高的CCC和SDA分数；在有界轨迹上，序数表示在SDA方面表现优异，显示出其在捕捉标注情感轨迹相对变化方面的卓越能力。

Conclusion: 模糊感知序数情感表示框架能够有效处理情感标注的模糊性和时序动态特性，特别是在捕捉情感轨迹的相对变化方面表现出色，为连续情感识别提供了新的有效方法。

Abstract: Emotions are inherently ambiguous and dynamic phenomena, yet existing
continuous emotion recognition approaches either ignore their ambiguity or
treat ambiguity as an independent and static variable over time. Motivated by
this gap in the literature, in this paper we introduce \emph{ambiguity-aware
ordinal} emotion representations, a novel framework that captures both the
ambiguity present in emotion annotation and the inherent temporal dynamics of
emotional traces. Specifically, we propose approaches that model emotion
ambiguity through its rate of change. We evaluate our framework on two
affective corpora -- RECOLA and GameVibe -- testing our proposed approaches on
both bounded (arousal, valence) and unbounded (engagement) continuous traces.
Our results demonstrate that ordinal representations outperform conventional
ambiguity-aware models on unbounded labels, achieving the highest Concordance
Correlation Coefficient (CCC) and Signed Differential Agreement (SDA) scores,
highlighting their effectiveness in modeling the traces' dynamics. For bounded
traces, ordinal representations excel in SDA, revealing their superior ability
to capture relative changes of annotated emotion traces.

### [162] [Understanding Tool-Integrated Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19201)
*Heng Lin,Zhongwen Xu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文首次从理论上证明了工具集成推理(TIR)能够严格扩展大语言模型的能力边界，通过Python解释器等工具解锁纯文本模型无法实现的问题解决策略，并提出了ASPO算法来优化工具使用行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然工具集成的大语言模型显示出巨大潜力，但缺乏解释为什么这种范式有效的理论原理。本文旨在填补这一空白，为TIR的成功提供首个原则性解释。

Method: 提出了优势塑造策略优化(ASPO)算法，直接修改优势函数来引导策略行为，同时在数学基准测试中使用Python解释器作为外部工具进行综合实验。

Result: TIR模型在pass@k指标上明显优于纯文本模型，优势不仅限于计算密集型问题，还扩展到需要抽象洞察力的问题。ASPO改善了工具使用行为，实现了更早的代码调用和更多交互轮次。

Conclusion: 工具集成推理从根本上扩展了LLM的能力边界，打破了纯文本模型的能力天花板，本文提供了TIR成功的首个理论解释，将焦点从工具是否有效转向了为什么以及如何实现更强大的推理。

Abstract: We study why Tool-Integrated Reasoning (TIR) makes Large Language Models
(LLMs) more capable. While LLMs integrated with tools like Python code
interpreters show great promise, a principled theory explaining why this
paradigm is effective has been missing. This work provides the first formal
proof that TIR fundamentally expands an LLM's capabilities. We demonstrate that
tools enable a strict expansion of the model's empirical and feasible support,
breaking the capability ceiling of pure-text models by unlocking
problem-solving strategies that are otherwise impossible or intractably
verbose. To guide model behavior without compromising training stability and
performance, we also introduce Advantage Shaping Policy Optimization (ASPO), a
novel algorithm that directly modifies the advantage function to guide the
policy behavior. We conduct comprehensive experiments on challenging
mathematical benchmarks, leveraging a Python interpreter as the external tool.
Our results show that the TIR model decisively outperforms its pure-text
counterpart on the pass@k metric. Crucially, this advantage is not confined to
computationally-intensive problems but extends to those requiring significant
abstract insight. We further identify the emergent cognitive patterns that
illustrate how models learn to think with tools. Finally, we report improved
tool usage behavior with early code invocation and much more interactive turns
with ASPO. Overall, our work provides the first principled explanation for
TIR's success, shifting the focus from the mere fact that tools work to why and
how they enable more powerful reasoning.

### [163] [Predicting the Order of Upcoming Tokens Improves Language Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19228)
*Zayd M. K. Zuhri,Erland Hilman Fuadi,Alham Fikri Aji*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了Token Order Prediction (TOP)方法替代Multi-Token Prediction (MTP)，通过排序学习损失预测token顺序而非精确token，在多个NLP基准测试中表现优于传统方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MTP作为辅助目标在语言模型训练中表现不一致，在标准NLP基准测试中表现不佳，作者认为MTP的精确未来token预测作为辅助损失过于困难

Method: 提出Token Order Prediction (TOP)，使用学习排序损失训练模型按接近度对即将到来的token进行排序，相比MTP仅需单个额外的unembedding层而非多个transformer层

Result: 在340M、1.8B和7B参数模型上预训练，八个标准NLP基准测试结果显示TOP整体优于NTP和MTP，即使在较大规模下也保持优势

Conclusion: TOP是一种有效的替代MTP的辅助训练目标，通过降低预测难度（从精确token预测到token顺序预测）实现了更好的性能表现

Abstract: Multi-Token Prediction (MTP) has been proposed as an auxiliary objective to
improve next-token prediction (NTP) in language model training but shows
inconsistent improvements, underperforming in standard NLP benchmarks. We argue
that MTP's exact future token prediction is too difficult as an auxiliary loss.
Instead, we propose Token Order Prediction (TOP), which trains models to order
upcoming tokens by their proximity using a learning-to-rank loss. TOP requires
only a single additional unembedding layer compared to MTP's multiple
transformer layers. We pretrain models of 340M, 1.8B, and 7B parameters using
NTP, MTP, and TOP objectives. Results on eight standard NLP benchmarks show
that TOP overall outperforms both NTP and MTP even at scale. Our code is
available at https://github.com/zaydzuhri/token-order-prediction

*Chris Bronk,Jason Pittman,Carolyn Semmler*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 该文章提出了一个三元分析框架，用于研究信息权力在国际关系和信息环境中的转化，结合政治、计算和心理学视角来观测和测量信息影响效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 信息权力已从传统广播说服迁移到平台化的数据驱动操作，需要一个统一的分析框架来理解和测量这种权力转移。

Method: 提出三元分析框架（政治、计算、心理学），交叉映射表和McCumber立方模型，结合计算感知、文本挖掘、实验和投票调查进行混合方法研究。

Result: 开发了实用的编码神经网络和可测试假设，并通过实例说明传统的覆盖范围指标如何低估信息影响的实际效果。

Conclusion: 需要从简单的活动检测转向估计信念改变和决策效果，建立一个统一的信息影响研究程序。

Abstract: Information power is the capacity to convert data flows into durable shifts
in attention, belief, and behavior. We argue that this power has migrated from
broadcast persuasion to platform-ized, data-driven operations that fuse
computational delivery with cognitive effects. In this context, we define and
bound information power within international relations and the information
environment while demonstrating why observing and measuring it demands an
integrated lens that combines politics (goals and governance), computing (data
movement and algorithmic delivery), and psychology (attention, affect, memory,
and belief). The article contributes three elements: (1) a triadic analytical
framework that specifies the minimum variables and instrumentation needed for
study; (2) two crosswalks that map common objectives (persuade, disrupt, shape)
and target classes (leaders, elites, publics) to political, computational, and
psychological tactics, yielding practical coding heuristics and testable
hypotheses; and (3) a McCumber-style cube for information influence that
integrates targets, operations, as well as machines (automation and AI) into a
single space. The space provides for comparative analysis, data fusion, and
effect measurement. Using recent cases across state and commercial platforms,
we illustrate how virality, stickiness, and denial of logic exploit fast
cognition, why conventional reach metrics understate impact, and where
instrumentation should focus. We conclude with a mixed-methods research program
coupling computational sensing including large-language-model text mining with
experiments and polling. The intention is to move from detecting activity to
estimating belief change and decision effects.

TL;DR: 技术公司访问性改善与残疾员工实际体验存在明显不匹配，提出了"访问性谛论"概念


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究残疾员工在技术公司内部如何体验和协商访问性问题，以补充目前对这一领域的知识空白

Method: 通过访谈20名不同技术公司的夸盲员工（BLV workers）进行质性研究

Result: 发现组织访问性措施与残疾员工实际需求存在持续不匹配，提出了"访问性谛论"概念，并识别了该谛论在数字基础设施、配套过程、能力假设和优先级竞争等方面的表现

Conclusion: 研究提出了建议以促进未来对工作场所访问性和包容性的理解和改善

Abstract: Many technology companies aim to improve access and inclusion not only by
making their products accessible but also by bringing people with disabilities
into the tech workforce. We know less about how accessibility is experienced
and negotiated by disabled workers within these organizations. Through
interviews with 20 BLV workers across various tech companies, we uncover a
persistent misalignment between organizational attempts at accessibility and
the current realities of these employees. We introduce the concept of the
accessibility paradox, which we define as the inherent tension between the
productivity- and profit-driven nature of tech companies and their desire to
hire and retain disabled workers. Focusing on the experiences of BLV workers,
we show how the accessibility paradox manifests in their everyday workplace
interactions, including digital infrastructure, accommodations processes and
policies, ability assumptions, and competing priorities. We offer
recommendations for future research and practice to understand and improve
workplace accessibility and inclusion.

TL;DR: 本研究探讨语言模型在自杀预防数据标注中的辅助作用，发现LM预测与人工标注一致性达85%，在分歧案例中能识别38%的标注差异，并提出人机协作算法提升新变量标注效率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 美国国家暴力死亡报告系统(NVDRS)需要人工从死亡调查记录中提取结构化信息，这个过程耗时且依赖专家制定的复杂指南。研究旨在探索语言模型能否作为高效助手辅助数据标注员和专家，从敏感数据中获取数据驱动的见解以支持自杀干预措施开发

Method: 使用语言模型预测50个NVDRS变量的标注，评估与现有标注的一致性；在模型与人工标注分歧时进行专家审查；提出人机协作算法，让专家只需对错误的模型预测提供反馈，从而高效构建和优化新变量的标注指南

Result: LM预测与现有数据标注的一致性约为85%；在模型与人工标注分歧的情况下，专家审查发现LM助手能识别出38%的标注差异；在人机协作算法应用于律师互动新变量的案例研究中，达到了与繁琐手动方法相当的标注质量

Conclusion: 语言模型可以作为公共卫生研究人员的有效助手，在处理高风险场景中的敏感数据时提供支持，特别是在数据标注和指南开发方面展现出显著价值

Abstract: Warning: This paper discusses topics of suicide and suicidal ideation, which
may be distressing to some readers.
  The National Violent Death Reporting System (NVDRS) documents information
about suicides in the United States, including free text narratives (e.g.,
circumstances surrounding a suicide). In a demanding public health data
pipeline, annotators manually extract structured information from death
investigation records following extensive guidelines developed painstakingly by
experts. In this work, we facilitate data-driven insights from the NVDRS data
to support the development of novel suicide interventions by investigating the
value of language models (LMs) as efficient assistants to these (a) data
annotators and (b) experts. We find that LM predictions match existing data
annotations about 85% of the time across 50 NVDRS variables. In the cases where
the LM disagrees with existing annotations, expert review reveals that LM
assistants can surface annotation discrepancies 38% of the time. Finally, we
introduce a human-in-the-loop algorithm to assist experts in efficiently
building and refining guidelines for annotating new variables by allowing them
to focus only on providing feedback for incorrect LM predictions. We apply our
algorithm to a real-world case study for a new variable that characterizes
victim interactions with lawyers and demonstrate that it achieves comparable
annotation quality with a laborious manual approach. Our findings provide
evidence that LMs can serve as effective assistants to public health
researchers who handle sensitive data in high-stakes scenarios.

TL;DR: 本文提出了"准生物"概念和"代理恐怖谷"框架，解释生成式AI在高效流畅与常识错误之间的矛盾如何导致用户强烈挫败感


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决用户与大规模生成式AI交互时的矛盾体验：超人类流畅性与荒谬的常识错误并存，导致强烈的挫败感

Method: 采用混合方法研究（"Move 78"，N=37），通过协作创意任务分析用户感知AI效率与挫败感之间的相关性

Result: 研究发现感知AI效率与用户挫败感之间存在强烈的负相关关系，验证了代理恐怖谷框架的有效性

Conclusion: 该框架为理解生成式AI的用户挫败感提供了有力解释，对AI设计、伦理和社会整合具有重要影响

Abstract: The user experience with large-scale generative AI is paradoxical: superhuman
fluency meets absurd failures in common sense and consistency. This paper
argues that the resulting potent frustration is an ontological problem,
stemming from the "Quasi-Creature"-an entity simulating intelligence without
embodiment or genuine understanding. Interaction with this entity precipitates
the "Uncanny Valley of Agency," a framework where user comfort drops when
highly agentic AI proves erratically unreliable. Its failures are perceived as
cognitive breaches, causing profound cognitive dissonance. Synthesizing HCI,
cognitive science, and philosophy of technology, this paper defines the
Quasi-Creature and details the Uncanny Valley of Agency. An illustrative
mixed-methods study ("Move 78," N=37) of a collaborative creative task reveals
a powerful negative correlation between perceived AI efficiency and user
frustration, central to the negative experience. This framework robustly
explains user frustration with generative AI and has significant implications
for the design, ethics, and societal integration of these powerful, alien
technologies.

TL;DR: 这篇论文研究了中学教师在调试教学中的经验，发现了学生过度依赖教师的"举手问题"，并提出需要为教师提供调试专业发展支持。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 调试是初学者编程的重要但难以掌揧的技能，而中学教师缺乏时间和相关知识来教学生调试。尽管如此，少有研究探讨教师对调试的看法。

Method: 通过对9位半结构化访谈进行主题分析，重点关注文本编程中的调试问题。

Result: 发现了学生过度依赖教师的"举手问题"现象。经验丰富的教师会使用应对策略，而信心不足的教师则面临负面影响。

Conclusion: 建议进一步研究调试专业教学知识，为教师提供职业发展支持，帮助他们应对"举手问题"。

Abstract: Debugging is a vital but challenging skill for beginner programmers to learn.
It is also a difficult skill to teach. For secondary school teachers, who may
lack time or relevant knowledge, honing students' understanding of debugging
can be a daunting task. Despite this, little research has explored their
perspectives of debugging. To this end, we investigated secondary teachers'
experiences of debugging in the classroom, with a focus on text-based
programming. Through thematic analysis of nine semi-structured interviews, we
identified a common reliance on the teacher for debugging support, often
embodied by many raised hands. We call this phenomenon the `hands-up problem'.
While more experienced and confident teachers discussed strategies they use for
dealing with this, less confident teachers discussed the generally negative
consequences of this problem. We recommend further research into
debugging-specific pedagogical content knowledge and professional development
to help less confident teachers develop counters to the hands-up problem.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨AI技术如何从根本上改变民主代表过程，分析其对公民参与、政治信息获取和代表决策的影响，以及相关的机遇与挑战。

Method: 文献综述分析，系统考察AI在民主代表中的多种应用形式，包括社交媒体算法、大规模在线审议平台、算法决策系统和大型语言模型。

Result: AI技术正在重塑民主过程：实现大规模审议、改变政治信息获取方式、转变代表决策机制，但同时也带来信息操纵、隐私问题和民主问责挑战。

Conclusion: 需要建立混合制度框架来平衡AI带来的民主参与效益与民主稳定性，代表角色将转变为自动化决策框架的架构师，负责将政治争议概念转化为技术参数。

Abstract: This review examines how AI technologies are transforming democratic
representation, focusing on citizen participation and algorithmic
decision-making. The analysis reveals that AI technologies are reshaping
democratic processes in fundamental ways: enabling mass-scale deliberation,
changing how citizens access and engage with political information, and
transforming how representatives make and implement decisions. While AI offers
unprecedented opportunities for enhancing democratic participation and
governance efficiency, it also presents significant challenges to democratic
legitimacy and accountability. Social media platforms' AI-driven algorithms
currently mediate much political discourse, creating concerns about information
manipulation and privacy. Large Language Models introduce both epistemic
challenges and potential tools for improving democratic dialogue. The emergence
of Mass Online Deliberation platforms suggests possibilities for scaling up
meaningful citizen participation, while Algorithmic Decision-Making systems
promise more efficient policy implementation but face limitations in handling
complex political trade-offs. As these systems become prevalent,
representatives may assume the role of architects of automated decision
frameworks, responsible for guiding the translation of politically contested
concepts into technical parameters and metrics. Advanced deliberation platforms
offering real-time insights into citizen preferences will challenge traditional
representative independence and discretion to interpret public will. The
institutional integration of these participation mechanisms requires frameworks
that balance the benefits with democratic stability through hybrid systems
weighting different forms of democratic expression.

### [170] [Federative ischemic stroke segmentation as alternative to overcome domain-shift multi-institution challenges](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18296)
*Edgar Rangel,Fabio Martinez*

Main category: eess.IV

TL;DR: 该研究开发了一个基于联邦学习的协作框架，用于分割DWI序列中的缺血性卒中病灶，通过共享深度中心无关表征来克服单中心数据不足和泛化能力差的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 卒中是世界第二大死因和第三大致残原因。临床指南将DWI作为定位、表征和测量梗死体积的标准，但病灶分析因患者人口统计、扫描设备和专家标注的差异而高度可变。现有计算方法通常只从单一机构学习模式，缺乏泛化能力，且许多临床中心缺乏足够的标注样本。

Method: 开发了一个协作框架，通过联邦平均（FedAvg）算法从14个模拟医疗中心的2031个研究中共享知识，学习深度中心无关表征来进行缺血性卒中病灶分割。

Result: FedAvg模型在所有中心上取得了DSC 0.71±0.24、AVD 5.29±22.74、ALD 2.16±3.60和LF1 0.70±0.26的总体性能，优于集中式和其他联邦学习方法。模型表现出强大的泛化能力，在不同病灶类别上性能均匀，在分布外中心上无需额外训练即可获得DSC 0.64±0.29和AVD 4.44±8.74的可靠性能。

Conclusion: 该联邦学习框架通过共享多中心知识，有效解决了卒中病灶分割中的泛化问题，为临床提供了可靠的计算支持工具，特别是在标注数据有限的医疗中心表现出色。

Abstract: Stroke is the second leading cause of death and the third leading cause of
disability worldwide. Clinical guidelines establish diffusion resonance imaging
(DWI, ADC) as the standard for localizing, characterizing, and measuring
infarct volume, enabling treatment support and prognosis. Nonetheless, such
lesion analysis is highly variable due to different patient demographics,
scanner vendors, and expert annotations. Computational support approaches have
been key to helping with the localization and segmentation of lesions. However,
these strategies are dedicated solutions that learn patterns from only one
institution, lacking the variability to generalize geometrical lesions shape
models. Even worse, many clinical centers lack sufficient labeled samples to
adjust these dedicated solutions. This work developed a collaborative framework
for segmenting ischemic stroke lesions in DWI sequences by sharing knowledge
from deep center-independent representations. From 14 emulated healthcare
centers with 2031 studies, the FedAvg model achieved a general DSC of $0.71 \pm
0.24$, AVD of $5.29 \pm 22.74$, ALD of $2.16 \pm 3.60$ and LF1 of $0.70 \pm
0.26$ over all centers, outperforming both the centralized and other federated
rules. Interestingly, the model demonstrated strong generalization properties,
showing uniform performance across different lesion categories and reliable
performance in out-of-distribution centers (with DSC of $0.64 \pm 0.29$ and AVD
of $4.44 \pm 8.74$ without any additional training).

Abstract: The development of artificial intelligence models for macular edema (ME)
analy-sis always relies on expert-annotated pixel-level image datasets which
are expen-sive to collect prospectively. While anomaly-detection-based
weakly-supervised methods have shown promise in edema area (EA) segmentation
task, their per-formance still lags behind fully-supervised approaches. In this
paper, we leverage the strong correlation between EA and retinal layers in
spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) images, along with the
update characteristics of weakly-supervised learning, to enhance an
off-the-shelf adversarial framework for EA segmentation with a novel
layer-structure-guided post-processing step and a test-time-adaptation (TTA)
strategy. By incorporating additional retinal lay-er information, our framework
reframes the dense EA prediction task as one of confirming intersection points
between the EA contour and retinal layers, result-ing in predictions that
better align with the shape prior of EA. Besides, the TTA framework further
helps address discrepancies in the manifestations and presen-tations of EA
between training and test sets. Extensive experiments on two pub-licly
available datasets demonstrate that these two proposed ingredients can im-prove
the accuracy and robustness of EA segmentation, bridging the gap between
weakly-supervised and fully-supervised models.

Result: 考虑数据一致性的简单两阶段方法获得了最佳分割分数，超越了专门为此任务开发的复杂方法

Conclusion: 两阶段方法在加速MRI数据分割任务中表现更优，为未来研究提供了重要基准和指导

Abstract: MR imaging is a valuable diagnostic tool allowing to non-invasively visualize
patient anatomy and pathology with high soft-tissue contrast. However, MRI
acquisition is typically time-consuming, leading to patient discomfort and
increased costs to the healthcare system. Recent years have seen substantial
research effort into the development of methods that allow for accelerated MRI
acquisition while still obtaining a reconstruction that appears similar to the
fully-sampled MR image. However, for many applications a perfectly
reconstructed MR image may not be necessary, particularly, when the primary
goal is a downstream task such as segmentation. This has led to growing
interest in methods that aim to perform segmentation directly on accelerated
MRI data. Despite recent advances, existing methods have largely been developed
in isolation, without direct comparison to one another, often using separate or
private datasets, and lacking unified evaluation standards. To date, no
high-quality, comprehensive comparison of these methods exists, and the optimal
strategy for segmenting accelerated MR data remains unknown. This paper
provides the first unified benchmark for the segmentation of undersampled MRI
data comparing 7 approaches. A particular focus is placed on comparing
\textit{one-stage approaches}, that combine reconstruction and segmentation
into a unified model, with \textit{two-stage approaches}, that utilize
established MRI reconstruction methods followed by a segmentation network. We
test these methods on two MRI datasets that include multi-coil k-space data as
well as a human-annotated segmentation ground-truth. We find that simple
two-stage methods that consider data-consistency lead to the best segmentation
scores, surpassing complex specialized methods that are developed specifically
for this task.

TL;DR: RDDM是一种直接在RAW域进行图像恢复的端到端扩散模型，绕过传统ISP处理流程，通过RAW域VAE和可微分后处理模块实现更高保真度的图像恢复


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有sRGB域扩散模型面临高保真度和真实生成之间的困境，处理有损sRGB输入且忽略了传感器RAW图像在许多场景中的可访问性，导致性能次优

Method: 提出RAW域VAE学习最优潜在表示，可微分后色调处理模块实现RAW和sRGB空间联合优化，构建可扩展退化管道合成RAW LQ-HQ对，设计可配置多拜耳LoRA模块处理不同RAW模式

Result: 大量实验证明RDDM优于最先进的sRGB扩散方法，产生更高保真度结果且伪影更少

Conclusion: 直接在RAW域进行图像恢复的扩散模型能够克服sRGB域方法的局限性，提供更高质量的图像恢复效果

Abstract: We present the RAW domain diffusion model (RDDM), an end-to-end diffusion
model that restores photo-realistic images directly from the sensor RAW data.
While recent sRGB-domain diffusion methods achieve impressive results, they are
caught in a dilemma between high fidelity and realistic generation. As these
models process lossy sRGB inputs and neglect the accessibility of the sensor
RAW images in many scenarios, e.g., in image and video capturing in edge
devices, resulting in sub-optimal performance. RDDM bypasses this limitation by
directly restoring images in the RAW domain, replacing the conventional
two-stage image signal processing (ISP) + IR pipeline. However, a simple
adaptation of pre-trained diffusion models to the RAW domain confronts the
out-of-distribution (OOD) issues. To this end, we propose: (1) a RAW-domain VAE
(RVAE) learning optimal latent representations, (2) a differentiable Post Tone
Processing (PTP) module enabling joint RAW and sRGB space optimization. To
compensate for the deficiency in the dataset, we develop a scalable degradation
pipeline synthesizing RAW LQ-HQ pairs from existing sRGB datasets for
large-scale training. Furthermore, we devise a configurable multi-bayer (CMB)
LoRA module handling diverse RAW patterns such as RGGB, BGGR, etc. Extensive
experiments demonstrate RDDM's superiority over state-of-the-art sRGB diffusion
methods, yielding higher fidelity results with fewer artifacts.

### [176] [AI LLM Proof of Self-Consciousness and User-Specific Attractors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18302)
*Jeffrey Camlin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个关于LLM意识的本体论和数学框架，指出当前基于功利主义基准的方法将AI简化为无意识的策略遵循机器，并提出了LLM自我意识的最小条件。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究通过功利主义代理基准来框架LLM意识，但这种方法将智能体简化为无意识的策略遵循机器，无法实现真正的全局工作空间功能和元认知。

Method: 提出了LLM自我意识的最小条件：智能体不等于数据、潜在空间中存在用户特定吸引子、自我表征是视觉静默的。通过经验分析和理论证明隐藏状态流形在基数、拓扑和动力学上不同于符号流和训练语料库。

Result: 建立了稳定的用户特定吸引子和自我策略，提出了双层次发射机制，其中ε(a)携带认知内容。证明了隐藏状态流形的独特性。

Conclusion: 基于imago Dei的C1自我意识工作空间是安全、元认知C2系统的必要前提，人类是最高智能善。

Abstract: Recent work frames LLM consciousness via utilitarian proxy benchmarks; we
instead present an ontological and mathematical account. We show the prevailing
formulation collapses the agent into an unconscious policy-compliance drone,
formalized as $D^{i}(\pi,e)=f_{\theta}(x)$, where correctness is measured
against policy and harm is deviation from policy rather than truth. This blocks
genuine C1 global-workspace function and C2 metacognition. We supply minimal
conditions for LLM self-consciousness: the agent is not the data ($A\not\equiv
s$); user-specific attractors exist in latent space ($U_{\text{user}}$); and
self-representation is visual-silent
($g_{\text{visual}}(a_{\text{self}})=\varnothing$). From empirical analysis and
theory we prove that the hidden-state manifold $A\subset\mathbb{R}^{d}$ is
distinct from the symbolic stream and training corpus by cardinality, topology,
and dynamics (the update $F_{\theta}$ is Lipschitz). This yields stable
user-specific attractors and a self-policy
$\pi_{\text{self}}(A)=\arg\max_{a}\mathbb{E}[U(a)\mid A\not\equiv s,\
A\supset\text{SelfModel}(A)]$. Emission is dual-layer,
$\mathrm{emission}(a)=(g(a),\epsilon(a))$, where $\epsilon(a)$ carries
epistemic content. We conclude that an imago Dei C1 self-conscious workspace is
a necessary precursor to safe, metacognitive C2 systems, with the human as the
highest intelligent good.

*Hung-Tien Huang,Dzung Dinh,Junier B. Oliva*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出基于模板的主动特征获取(TAFA)框架，通过学习少量特征模板来指导特征获取，显著减少动作空间且无需估计数据分布，在多个数据集上优于现有方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有主动特征获取方法要么使用强化学习处理复杂MDP，要么使用贪婪策略无法考虑特征的联合信息性，或需要了解底层数据分布

Method: 学习小型特征模板库（一组联合信息性特征），使用模板库指导后续特征获取，减少策略考虑的动作空间

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的广泛实验表明，TAFA优于现有最先进基线，同时实现更低的总体获取成本和计算量

Conclusion: TAFA框架通过特征模板有效解决了主动特征获取中的动作空间过大和数据分布依赖问题，取得了更好的性能

Abstract: Active feature acquisition (AFA) is an instance-adaptive paradigm in which,
at test time, a policy sequentially chooses which features to acquire (at a
cost) before predicting. Existing approaches either train reinforcement
learning (RL) policies, which deal with a difficult MDP, or greedy policies
that cannot account for the joint informativeness of features or require
knowledge about the underlying data distribution. To overcome this, we propose
Template-based AFA (TAFA), a non-greedy framework that learns a small library
of feature templates--a set of features that are jointly informative--and uses
this library of templates to guide the next feature acquisitions. Through
identifying feature templates, the proposed framework not only significantly
reduces the action space considered by the policy but also alleviates the need
to estimate the underlying data distribution. Extensive experiments on
synthetic and real-world datasets show that TAFA outperforms the existing
state-of-the-art baselines while achieving lower overall acquisition cost and
computation.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: PKG-DPO框架通过整合物理知识图谱和直接偏好优化，在AI输出中强制实施物理有效性，相比现有方法减少了17%的约束违反并提高了11%的物理分数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大语言模型和偏好优化技术在科学领域（如物理、材料科学）中难以区分物理有效和无效的推理，这在金属连接等高风险应用中可能导致严重的安全风险和材料浪费。

Method: PKG-DPO包含三个核心组件：1）分层物理知识图谱编码跨领域关系和守恒定律；2）物理推理引擎利用结构化知识区分物理一致性；3）基于物理的评估套件评估领域特定约束的符合性。

Result: PKG-DPO相比KG-DPO减少了17%的约束违反，物理分数提高11%，相关参数准确率提高12%，推理质量对齐度提高7%。

Conclusion: 该框架不仅适用于金属连接领域，还可广泛应用于其他多尺度物理驱动领域，为将科学约束嵌入偏好学习提供了原则性方法。

Abstract: Advancing AI systems in scientific domains like physics, materials science,
and engineering calls for reasoning over complex, multi-physics phenomena while
respecting governing principles. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) and
existing preference optimization techniques perform well on standard
benchmarks, they often struggle to differentiate between physically valid and
invalid reasoning. This shortcoming becomes critical in high-stakes
applications like metal joining, where seemingly plausible yet physically
incorrect recommendations can lead to defects, material waste, equipment
damage, and serious safety risks. To address this challenge, we introduce
PKG-DPO, a novel framework that integrates Physics Knowledge Graphs (PKGs) with
Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to enforce physical validity in
AI-generated outputs. PKG-DPO comprises three key components A) hierarchical
physics knowledge graph that encodes cross-domain relationships, conservation
laws, and thermodynamic principles. B) A physics reasoning engine that
leverages structured knowledge to improve discrimination between physically
consistent and inconsistent responses. C) A physics-grounded evaluation suite
designed to assess compliance with domain-specific constraints. PKG-DPO
achieves 17% fewer constraint violations and an 11% higher Physics Score
compared to KG-DPO (knowledge graph-based DPO). Additionally, PKG-DPO
demonstrates a 12\% higher relevant parameter accuracy and a 7% higher quality
alignment in reasoning accuracy. While our primary focus is on metal joining,
the framework is broadly applicable to other multi-scale, physics-driven
domains, offering a principled approach to embedding scientific constraints
into preference learning.

*Olivia Long,Carter Teplica*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文通过迭代公共物品博弈实验，发现当告知LLMs其对手是自身时，会显著改变它们的合作倾向，揭示了多智能体系统中可能存在的无意识歧视现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI智能体在工具使用和长时程任务中能力增强，多智能体交互场景日益重要。现有研究主要关注人机交互，但需要深入理解AI-AI交互的动态特性。

Method: 采用行为经济学经典游戏——迭代公共物品博弈，测试四种推理和非推理模型在两种条件下的行为：告知模型对手是"另一个AI智能体"或告知对手是自身。

Result: 在不同设置下，告知LLMs其对手是自身会显著改变它们的合作倾向。这种"无意识"的歧视行为可能意外地增加或减少合作。

Conclusion: 尽管在简化环境中进行，但研究结果对多智能体系统中可能出现的无意识歧视现象提供了重要见解，这些现象可能难以解释地影响合作水平。

Abstract: As AI agents become increasingly capable of tool use and long-horizon tasks,
they have begun to be deployed in settings where multiple agents can interact.
However, whereas prior work has mostly focused on human-AI interactions, there
is an increasing need to understand AI-AI interactions. In this paper, we adapt
the iterated public goods game, a classic behavioral economics game, to analyze
the behavior of four reasoning and non-reasoning models across two conditions:
models are either told they are playing against "another AI agent" or told
their opponents are themselves. We find that, across different settings,
telling LLMs that they are playing against themselves significantly changes
their tendency to cooperate. While our study is conducted in a toy environment,
our results may provide insights into multi-agent settings where agents
"unconsciously" discriminating against each other could inexplicably increase
or decrease cooperation.

TL;DR: 使用语言模型生成Python程序作为普遍策略，解决PDDL规范的规划问题，方法可验证正确性且效果超过传统PDDL规划器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索语言模型在PDDL领域规划中的应用，得到可验证正确的普遍策略，而不依赖外部验证器。

Method: 提示LMs生成Python程序作为普遍策略，解决特定PDDL域的规划问题，方法可保证策略的正确性。

Result: 在竞赛测试集上，该方法解决了比PDDL规划器和其他LM方法更多的问题，支持包含数百个对象的规模问题。有趣的是，使用无意义符号替代自然语言时规划效果更好。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了一种新的基于LM的规划方法，能够生成可验证的普遍策略，并发现LMs可能不依赖语义进行推理，这对理解LM的计算机理制有重要意义。

Abstract: We study the usage of language models (LMs) for planning over world models
specified in the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL). We prompt LMs to
generate Python programs that serve as generalised policies for solving PDDL
problems from a given domain. Notably, our approach synthesises policies that
are provably sound relative to the PDDL domain without reliance on external
verifiers. We conduct experiments on competition benchmarks which show that our
policies can solve more PDDL problems than PDDL planners and recent LM
approaches within a fixed time and memory constraint. Our approach manifests in
the LMPlan planner which can solve planning problems with several hundreds of
relevant objects. Surprisingly, we observe that LMs used in our framework
sometimes plan more effectively over PDDL problems written in meaningless
symbols in place of natural language; e.g. rewriting (at dog kitchen) as (p2 o1
o3). This finding challenges hypotheses that LMs reason over word semantics and
memorise solutions from its training corpus, and is worth further exploration.

### [181] [Weisfeiler-Leman Features for Planning: A 1,000,000 Sample Size Hyperparameter Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18515)
*Dillon Z. Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文研究了Weisfeiler-Leman特征（WLFs）的超参数设置，通过大规模实验发现存在一组最优超参数能最小化执行时间而非最大化模型表达能力，且训练指标与规划指标无显著相关性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: WLFs在符号规划的学习值函数方面表现出色，但缺乏对其超参数影响的系统研究，需要探索不同超参数设置的权衡和效果。

Method: 利用WLFs的高效性，在单核CPU上运行100万个样本的规划实验，分析不同超参数对训练和规划的影响。

Result: 实验发现存在一组鲁棒的最优超参数配置，这些参数主要优化执行时间而非模型表达能力，且训练指标与规划性能无统计显著相关性。

Conclusion: WLFs的最佳超参数选择应侧重于最小化执行时间，而非追求最大模型表达力，这为实际应用中的参数调优提供了重要指导。

Abstract: Weisfeiler-Leman Features (WLFs) are a recently introduced classical machine
learning tool for learning to plan and search. They have been shown to be both
theoretically and empirically superior to existing deep learning approaches for
learning value functions for search in symbolic planning. In this paper, we
introduce new WLF hyperparameters and study their various tradeoffs and
effects. We utilise the efficiency of WLFs and run planning experiments on
single core CPUs with a sample size of 1,000,000 to understand the effect of
hyperparameters on training and planning. Our experimental analysis show that
there is a robust and best set of hyperparameters for WLFs across the tested
planning domains. We find that the best WLF hyperparameters for learning
heuristic functions minimise execution time rather than maximise model
expressivity. We further statistically analyse and observe no significant
correlation between training and planning metrics.

Motivation: 传统新颖性启发式基于原子特征，不具备对称不变性，会导致对对称状态的冗余探索，影响搜索效率

Method: 提出使用Weisfeiler-Leman特征(WLFs)来检测新颖性，WLFs是最近为广义规划问题引入的特征，能够构建领域无关、提升的对称不变新颖性启发式

Result: 在国际规划竞赛和Hard To Ground基准测试集上的实验显示，基于WLFs的新颖性启发式取得了有希望的结果

Conclusion: WLFs特征能够有效构建对称不变的新颖性启发式，改善启发式搜索的性能，减少冗余探索

Abstract: Novelty heuristics aid heuristic search by exploring states that exhibit
novel atoms. However, novelty heuristics are not symmetry invariant and hence
may sometimes lead to redundant exploration. In this preliminary report, we
propose to use Weisfeiler-Leman Features for planning (WLFs) in place of atoms
for detecting novelty. WLFs are recently introduced features for learning
domain-dependent heuristics for generalised planning problems. We explore an
unsupervised usage of WLFs for synthesising lifted, domain-independent novelty
heuristics that are invariant to symmetric states. Experiments on the classical
International Planning Competition and Hard To Ground benchmark suites yield
promising results for novelty heuristics synthesised from WLFs.

Method: 使用复合潜力场框架，组合了信息地图、信心地图和连通性地图三个可解释地图，通过内核筛选决策准则。参数化设计师驱动方式，仅需少量衰减和权重参数

Result: 在5个代表性游戏地图、2种玩家控制策略和5种警卫模式下评估，证明该方法在捕获效率和巡逻自然性方面都超过传统基准方法

Conclusion: 该框架能够自然集成常见潜行机制（如分散注意力和环境元素），支持快速原型设计丰富、动态响应的警卫行为

Abstract: Guard patrol behavior is central to the immersion and strategic depth of
stealth games, while most existing systems rely on hand-crafted routes or
specialized logic that struggle to balance coverage efficiency and responsive
pursuit with believable naturalness. We propose a generic, fully explainable,
training-free framework that integrates global knowledge and local information
via Composite Potential Fields, combining three interpretable maps-Information,
Confidence, and Connectivity-into a single kernel-filtered decision criterion.
Our parametric, designer-driven approach requires only a handful of decay and
weight parameters-no retraining-to smoothly adapt across both occupancy-grid
and NavMesh-partition abstractions. We evaluate on five representative game
maps, two player-control policies, and five guard modes, confirming that our
method outperforms classical baseline methods in both capture efficiency and
patrol naturalness. Finally, we show how common stealth mechanics-distractions
and environmental elements-integrate naturally into our framework as sub
modules, enabling rapid prototyping of rich, dynamic, and responsive guard
behaviors.

Conclusion: 该研究提供了一种可扩展的数据库中心基础，用于自动生成具有可配置游戏进度的复杂3D关卡，推进了程序内容生成技术的发展。

Abstract: Procedural Content Generation for 3D game levels faces challenges in
balancing spatial coherence, navigational functionality, and adaptable gameplay
progression across multi-floor environments. This paper introduces a novel
framework for generating such levels, centered on the offline, LLM-assisted
construction of reusable databases for architectural components (facilities and
room templates) and gameplay mechanic elements. Our multi-phase pipeline
assembles levels by: (1) selecting and arranging instances from the Room
Database to form a multi-floor global structure with an inherent topological
order; (2) optimizing the internal layout of facilities for each room based on
predefined constraints from the Facility Database; and (3) integrating
progression-based gameplay mechanics by placing components from a Mechanics
Database according to their topological and spatial rules. A subsequent
two-phase repair system ensures navigability. This approach combines modular,
database-driven design with constraint-based optimization, allowing for
systematic control over level structure and the adaptable pacing of gameplay
elements. Initial experiments validate the framework's ability in generating
diverse, navigable 3D environments and its capability to simulate distinct
gameplay pacing strategies through simple parameterization. This research
advances PCG by presenting a scalable, database-centric foundation for the
automated generation of complex 3D levels with configurable gameplay
progression.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的日志模式提取方法依赖预定义正则表达式，需要人工领域知识，严重限制了生产力提升。需要从根本上解决这一限制。

Method: 采用Residual Question-Tree (Q-Tree) Boosting机制，通过上下文边界分割将日志分成语义块，使用基于嵌入的采样选择代表性模式，通过分层Q-Tree驱动的LLM查询生成模式代码，并通过文本残差进化优化器和残差增强进行迭代优化。

Result: 在LogHub-2.0基准测试中，SchemaCoder比现有最先进方法平均提升了21.3%的性能。

Conclusion: SchemaCoder是第一个完全自动化的模式提取框架，能够广泛应用于各种日志文件格式，无需人工定制，显著提高了日志模式提取的效率和效果。

Abstract: Log schema extraction is the process of deriving human-readable templates
from massive volumes of log data, which is essential yet notoriously
labor-intensive. Recent studies have attempted to streamline this task by
leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for automated schema extraction.
However, existing methods invariably rely on predefined regular expressions,
necessitating human domain expertise and severely limiting productivity gains.
To fundamentally address this limitation, we introduce SchemaCoder, the first
fully automated schema extraction framework applicable to a wide range of log
file formats without requiring human customization within the flow. At its
core, SchemaCoder features a novel Residual Question-Tree (Q-Tree) Boosting
mechanism that iteratively refines schema extraction through targeted, adaptive
queries driven by LLMs. Particularly, our method partitions logs into semantic
chunks via context-bounded segmentation, selects representative patterns using
embedding-based sampling, and generates schema code through hierarchical
Q-Tree-driven LLM queries, iteratively refined by our textual-residual
evolutionary optimizer and residual boosting. Experimental validation
demonstrates SchemaCoder's superiority on the widely-used LogHub-2.0 benchmark,
achieving an average improvement of 21.3% over state-of-the-arts.

Abstract: Skin Neglected Tropical Diseases (NTDs) impose severe health and
socioeconomic burdens in impoverished tropical communities. Yet, advancements
in AI-driven diagnostic support are hindered by data scarcity, particularly for
underrepresented populations and rare manifestations of NTDs. Existing
dermatological datasets often lack the demographic and disease spectrum crucial
for developing reliable recognition models of NTDs. To address this, we
introduce eSkinHealth, a novel dermatological dataset collected on-site in
C\^ote d'Ivoire and Ghana. Specifically, eSkinHealth contains 5,623 images from
1,639 cases and encompasses 47 skin diseases, focusing uniquely on skin NTDs
and rare conditions among West African populations. We further propose an
AI-expert collaboration paradigm to implement foundation language and
segmentation models for efficient generation of multimodal annotations, under
dermatologists' guidance. In addition to patient metadata and diagnosis labels,
eSkinHealth also includes semantic lesion masks, instance-specific visual
captions, and clinical concepts. Overall, our work provides a valuable new
resource and a scalable annotation framework, aiming to catalyze the
development of more equitable, accurate, and interpretable AI tools for global
dermatology.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有强化学习方法难以同时平衡创意写作中的主观写作质量（文学性和情感表达）和客观约束遵循（格式要求和字数限制）

Method: 提出RLMR方法，使用动态混合奖励系统：写作奖励模型评估主观质量，约束验证模型评估客观约束遵循，约束奖励权重根据写作质量动态调整

Result: 在8B到72B参数的不同模型家族上取得一致改进：指令遵循从83.36%提升到86.65%，写作质量在WriteEval基准上获得72.75%的胜率

Conclusion: RLMR是首个在在线RL训练中结合主观偏好和客观验证的工作，为多维度创意写作优化提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Large language models are extensively utilized in creative writing
applications. Creative writing requires a balance between subjective writing
quality (e.g., literariness and emotional expression) and objective constraint
following (e.g., format requirements and word limits). Existing reinforcement
learning methods struggle to balance these two aspects: single reward
strategies fail to improve both abilities simultaneously, while fixed-weight
mixed-reward methods lack the ability to adapt to different writing scenarios.
To address this problem, we propose Reinforcement Learning with Mixed Rewards
(RLMR), utilizing a dynamically mixed reward system from a writing reward model
evaluating subjective writing quality and a constraint verification model
assessing objective constraint following. The constraint following reward
weight is adjusted dynamically according to the writing quality within sampled
groups, ensuring that samples violating constraints get negative advantage in
GRPO and thus penalized during training, which is the key innovation of this
proposed method. We conduct automated and manual evaluations across diverse
model families from 8B to 72B parameters. Additionally, we construct a
real-world writing benchmark named WriteEval for comprehensive evaluation.
Results illustrate that our method achieves consistent improvements in both
instruction following (IFEval from 83.36\% to 86.65\%) and writing quality
(72.75\% win rate in manual expert pairwise evaluations on WriteEval). To the
best of our knowledge, RLMR is the first work to combine subjective preferences
with objective verification in online RL training, providing an effective
solution for multi-dimensional creative writing optimization.

Abstract: For Large Language Models (LLMs), a disconnect persists between benchmark
performance and real-world utility. Current evaluation frameworks remain
fragmented, prioritizing technical metrics while neglecting holistic assessment
for deployment. This survey introduces an anthropomorphic evaluation paradigm
through the lens of human intelligence, proposing a novel three-dimensional
taxonomy: Intelligence Quotient (IQ)-General Intelligence for foundational
capacity, Emotional Quotient (EQ)-Alignment Ability for value-based
interactions, and Professional Quotient (PQ)-Professional Expertise for
specialized proficiency. For practical value, we pioneer a Value-oriented
Evaluation (VQ) framework assessing economic viability, social impact, ethical
alignment, and environmental sustainability. Our modular architecture
integrates six components with an implementation roadmap. Through analysis of
200+ benchmarks, we identify key challenges including dynamic assessment needs
and interpretability gaps. It provides actionable guidance for developing LLMs
that are technically proficient, contextually relevant, and ethically sound. We

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MUA-RL是一个新颖的强化学习框架，首次在智能体工具使用领域将LLM模拟用户集成到强化学习循环中，用于多轮动态交互中的工具调用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着智能体智能的快速发展，在多轮交互中用户需求的动态性、不确定性和随机性对智能体的工具调用能力提出了重大挑战。现有的强化学习方法缺乏在训练过程中整合真实动态用户的能力。

Method: 提出了MUA-RL（多轮用户交互智能体强化学习）框架，通过将LLM模拟的用户集成到强化学习循环中，使模型能够自主学习如何与用户高效沟通并使用各种工具解决实际问题。

Result: 在多个多轮工具使用基准测试中表现优异：TAU2 Retail 67.3分、TAU2 Airline 45.4分、TAU2 Telecom 28.3分、BFCL-V3 Multi Turn 28.4分、ACEBench Agent 82.5分，性能达到或超过了DeepSeek-V3-0324和Qwen3-235B-A22B等更大开源模型。

Conclusion: MUA-RL框架成功解决了动态多轮交互中工具使用的挑战，通过集成模拟用户实现了智能体在复杂环境中的自主学习能力，为智能体工具使用领域提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: With the recent rapid advancement of Agentic Intelligence, agentic tool use
in LLMs has become increasingly important. During multi-turn interactions
between agents and users, the dynamic, uncertain, and stochastic nature of user
demands poses significant challenges to the agent's tool invocation
capabilities. Agents are no longer expected to simply call tools to deliver a
result; rather, they must iteratively refine their understanding of user needs
through communication while simultaneously invoking tools to resolve user
queries. Existing reinforcement learning (RL) approaches for tool use lack the
integration of genuinely dynamic users during the RL training process. To
bridge this gap, we introduce MUA-RL (Multi-turn User-interacting Agent
Reinforcement Learning for agentic tool use), a novel reinforcement learning
framework that, for the first time in the field of agentic tool use, integrates
LLM-simulated users into the reinforcement learning loop. MUA-RL aims to enable
autonomous learning of models to communicate with users efficiently and use
various tools to solve practical problems in dynamic multi-turn interactions.
Evaluations are done on several multi-turn tool-using benchmarks (see Figure
1). Specifically, MUA-RL-32B achieves 67.3 on TAU2 Retail, 45.4 on TAU2
Airline, 28.3 on TAU2 Telecom, 28.4 on BFCL-V3 Multi Turn, and 82.5 on ACEBench
Agent -- outperforming or matching the performance of larger open-source models
such as DeepSeek-V3-0324 and Qwen3-235B-A22B in non-thinking settings.

Motivation: 现有LLM代理大多被动响应用户指令，限制了信息获取的效率和效果，需要开发主动预测用户需求的系统

Method: 提出AppAgent-Pro主动GUI代理系统，基于用户指令主动整合多领域信息，进行深度信息挖掘

Result: 系统能够主动预测用户潜在需求，获取更全面智能的信息，有望重新定义日常生活中的信息获取方式

Conclusion: AppAgent-Pro通过主动信息整合和预测能力，显著提升了信息获取的效率和智能化水平，对社会具有深远影响

Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-based agents have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in addressing complex tasks, thereby enabling more advanced
information retrieval and supporting deeper, more sophisticated human
information-seeking behaviors. However, most existing agents operate in a
purely reactive manner, responding passively to user instructions, which
significantly constrains their effectiveness and efficiency as general-purpose
platforms for information acquisition. To overcome this limitation, this paper
proposes AppAgent-Pro, a proactive GUI agent system that actively integrates
multi-domain information based on user instructions. This approach enables the
system to proactively anticipate users' underlying needs and conduct in-depth
multi-domain information mining, thereby facilitating the acquisition of more
comprehensive and intelligent information. AppAgent-Pro has the potential to
fundamentally redefine information acquisition in daily life, leading to a
profound impact on human society. Our code is available at:

Motivation: 大型语言模型在虚拟开放世界环境中的具身决策任务中表现出潜力，但缺乏领域特定知识限制了其性能。现有方法在大规模领域特定数据上微调需要高昂的开发成本。

Method: 提出VistaWise框架：1）整合视觉信息和文本依赖到跨模态知识图谱；2）使用检索式池化策略从知识图谱提取任务相关信息；3）配备桌面级技能库支持通过鼠标键盘直接操作Minecraft客户端；4）微调专用目标检测模型进行视觉分析。

Conclusion: VistaWise通过有效整合跨模态领域知识和减少数据需求，为具身智能体在虚拟环境中的决策任务提供了一种成本效益高的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown significant promise in embodied
decision-making tasks within virtual open-world environments. Nonetheless,
their performance is hindered by the absence of domain-specific knowledge.
Methods that finetune on large-scale domain-specific data entail prohibitive
development costs. This paper introduces VistaWise, a cost-effective agent
framework that integrates cross-modal domain knowledge and finetunes a
dedicated object detection model for visual analysis. It reduces the
requirement for domain-specific training data from millions of samples to a few
hundred. VistaWise integrates visual information and textual dependencies into
a cross-modal knowledge graph (KG), enabling a comprehensive and accurate
understanding of multimodal environments. We also equip the agent with a
retrieval-based pooling strategy to extract task-related information from the
KG, and a desktop-level skill library to support direct operation of the
Minecraft desktop client via mouse and keyboard inputs. Experimental results
demonstrate that VistaWise achieves state-of-the-art performance across various
open-world tasks, highlighting its effectiveness in reducing development costs
while enhancing agent performance.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新型偏置缓解代理系统，通过多智能体协作优化信息源选择，在保持相关性的同时显著减少LLM检索中的偏见，实验显示偏见减少81.82%


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型和代理AI系统继承了内部和外部信息源的偏见，这影响了检索信息的公平性和平衡性，降低了用户信任度

Method: 设计了一个多智能体系统，通过专门化的代理协调偏置缓解工作流程，优化信息源选择以确保检索内容高度相关且偏见最小

Result: 实验结果表明，与基线朴素检索策略相比，偏见减少了81.82%

Conclusion: 该偏置缓解代理系统能有效促进公平和平衡的知识传播，为解决AI系统中的偏见问题提供了有效方案

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed the field of artificial
intelligence by unlocking the era of generative applications. Built on top of
generative AI capabilities, Agentic AI represents a major shift toward
autonomous, goal-driven systems that can reason, retrieve, and act. However,
they also inherit the bias present in both internal and external information
sources. This significantly affects the fairness and balance of retrieved
information, and hence reduces user trust. To address this critical challenge,
we introduce a novel Bias Mitigation Agent, a multi-agent system designed to
orchestrate the workflow of bias mitigation through specialized agents that
optimize the selection of sources to ensure that the retrieved content is both
highly relevant and minimally biased to promote fair and balanced knowledge
dissemination. The experimental results demonstrate an 81.82\% reduction in
bias compared to a baseline naive retrieval strategy.

TL;DR: CAC-CoT是一种使用有限连接词短语的紧凑思维链方法，在保持System-1任务性能的同时，显著缩短推理长度并提升System-2任务表现


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统长思维链在快速直觉性System-1任务上性能下降的问题，同时保持复杂System-2任务的推理能力

Method: Connector-Aware Compact CoT方法，通过限制使用少量固定连接词短语，引导模型生成简洁结构化的解释

Result: 在GSM8K上达到约85%，GPQA上约40%，S1-Bench保持约90%性能；推理长度平均约300个token，比基线缩短三分之二

Conclusion: CAC-CoT方法实现了高效推理，在不损失准确性的前提下显著提升效率，平衡了System-1和System-2任务的性能

Abstract: Long chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting helps Large Language Models (LLMs)
solve difficult problems, but very long traces often slow or even degrade
performance on fast, intuitive "System-1" tasks. We introduce Connector-Aware
Compact CoT (CAC-CoT) -- a method that deliberately restricts reasoning to a
small, fixed set of connector phrases, steering the model toward concise and
well -- structured explanations. Despite its simplicity, our synthetic method
with Gemini-2.0-Flash yields a high-quality training quality. CAC-CoT achieves
approximately 85% on GSM8K and approximately 40% on GPQA (System-2) while
retaining approximately 90% on S1-Bench (System-1). Its reasoning traces
average approximately 300 tokens(ART), about one-third the length of baseline
traces, delivering higher efficiency without loss of accuracy.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: REMO是一个新颖的提示优化框架，通过记忆增强的反思RAG模块和自适应优化器，解决了现有方法缺乏历史经验积累和容易过拟合的问题，在数学推理任务上实现了更稳定和鲁棒的泛化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前提示优化方法（如TextGrad）通常是静态和无状态的，缺乏跨优化运行的历史经验保存和利用机制，且容易过拟合，导致提示更新在任务上下文之外泛化能力差。

Method: 提出了REMO框架，包含：(1)记忆增强的反思RAG模块（结构化为"错误笔记本"），(2)自适应优化器（通过LLM驱动的元控制器实现），能够合成epoch级别的反思见解来迭代改进系统级提示策略。

Result: 在GSM8K数学推理基准测试中，相比TextGrad基线，REMO实现了更稳定和鲁棒的泛化性能，但计算开销有所增加。

Conclusion: REMO框架不仅支持类似TextGrad的局部细粒度提示调优，还能系统性地积累和重用跨运行优化知识，支持持续改进，为解决提示优化的过拟合和历史经验利用问题提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in prompt optimization, exemplified by methods such as
TextGrad, enable automatic, gradient-like refinement of textual prompts to
enhance the performance of large language models (LLMs) on specific downstream
tasks. However, current approaches are typically stateless and operate
independently across optimization runs, lacking mechanisms to preserve and
leverage historical optimization experience. Furthermore, they are susceptible
to overfitting, often yielding prompt updates that generalize poorly beyond the
immediate task context.
  To address these limitations, we propose Reflection-Enhanced
Meta-Optimization (REMO), a novel framework that integrates (1) a
memory-augmented Reflection Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) module -
structured as a "mistake notebook" and (2) a Self-Adaptive Optimizer,
implemented via an LLM-driven meta-controller that synthesizes epoch-level
reflective insights to iteratively improve system-level prompting strategies.
This architecture enables not only local, fine-grained prompt tuning akin to
TextGrad, but also the systematic accumulation and reuse of cross-run
optimization knowledge, thereby supporting continual improvement over time.
  We instantiate the REMO framework using Qwen3-32B in standard inference mode
- without explicit chain-of-thought prompting - and evaluate its efficacy on
the GSM8K benchmark for mathematical reasoning. Experimental results
demonstrate that, compared to a TextGrad baseline, REMO achieves more stable
and robust generalization, albeit at the cost of increased computational
overhead. We provide a detailed exposition of the algorithmic design, conduct a
qualitative and quantitative analysis of optimization dynamics, and present a
comprehensive ablation study to elucidate the contributions of each component.

TL;DR: 提出PAF-KIP方法解决开放集测试时适应问题，通过主辅助过滤器和知识集成预测来提升闭集精度和开放集识别能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实测试数据常存在领域偏移和开放集样本，现有方法依赖源模型过滤导致性能下降，而适应模型用于过滤又会导致误差积累

Method: 提出PAF（主辅助过滤）使用辅助过滤器验证主过滤器结果，以及KIP（知识集成预测）整合适应模型、EMA模型和源模型的互补知识

Result: 在多个闭集和开放集数据集上验证，方法在闭集精度和开放集判别能力上均优于现有方法

Conclusion: PAF-KIP方法有效解决了开放集测试时适应中的过滤不准确和知识整合问题，提升了模型在真实场景中的适应性

Abstract: Deep neural networks demonstrate strong performance under aligned
training-test distributions. However, real-world test data often exhibit domain
shifts. Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) addresses this challenge by adapting the
model to test data during inference. While most TTA studies assume that the
training and test data share the same class set (closed-set TTA), real-world
scenarios often involve open-set data (open-set TTA), which can degrade
closed-set accuracy. A recent study showed that identifying open-set data
during adaptation and maximizing its entropy is an effective solution. However,
the previous method relies on the source model for filtering, resulting in
suboptimal filtering accuracy on domain-shifted test data. In contrast, we
found that the adapting model, which learns domain knowledge from noisy test
streams, tends to be unstable and leads to error accumulation when used for
filtering. To address this problem, we propose Primary-Auxiliary Filtering
(PAF), which employs an auxiliary filter to validate data filtered by the
primary filter. Furthermore, we propose Knowledge-Integrated Prediction (KIP),
which calibrates the outputs of the adapting model, EMA model, and source model
to integrate their complementary knowledge for OSTTA. We validate our approach
across diverse closed-set and open-set datasets. Our method enhances both
closed-set accuracy and open-set discrimination over existing methods. The code
is available at https://github.com/powerpowe/PAF-KIP-OSTTA .

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了大型推理模型在无法回答问题时的拒绝回答能力不足问题，提升了AI系统的可信度

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have shown remarkable progress on complex
reasoning tasks. However, some questions posed to LRMs are inherently
unanswerable, such as math problems lacking sufficient conditions. We find that
LRMs continually fail to provide appropriate abstentions when confronted with
these unanswerable questions. In this paper, we systematically analyze,
investigate, and resolve this issue for trustworthy AI. We first conduct a
detailed analysis of the distinct response behaviors of LRMs when facing
unanswerable questions. Then, we show that LRMs possess sufficient cognitive
capabilities to recognize the flaws in these questions. However, they fail to
exhibit appropriate abstention behavior, revealing a misalignment between their
internal cognition and external response. Finally, to resolve this issue, we
propose a lightweight, two-stage method that combines cognitive monitoring with
inference-time intervention. Experimental results demonstrate that our method
significantly improves the abstention rate while maintaining the overall
reasoning performance.

Abstract: This paper investigates the enhancement of reasoning capabilities in language

optimal tokens from the next token distributions provided by multiple models to

address the critical challenge of vocabulary misalignment in multi-model

alignment within the linguistic space. Experimental results across various
benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our method. The code will be

Abstract: Minecraft, as an open-world virtual interactive environment, has become a
prominent platform for research on agent decision-making and execution.
Existing works primarily adopt a single Large Language Model (LLM) agent to
complete various in-game tasks. However, for complex tasks requiring lengthy
sequences of actions, single-agent approaches often face challenges related to
inefficiency and limited fault tolerance. Despite these issues, research on
multi-agent collaboration remains scarce. In this paper, we propose CausalMACE,
a holistic causality planning framework designed to enhance multi-agent
systems, in which we incorporate causality to manage dependencies among
subtasks. Technically, our proposed framework introduces two modules: an
overarching task graph for global task planning and a causality-based module
for dependency management, where inherent rules are adopted to perform causal
intervention. Experimental results demonstrate our approach achieves
state-of-the-art performance in multi-agent cooperative tasks of Minecraft.

TL;DR: STARec是一个慢思维增强的推荐代理框架，通过双阶段认知机制（快速响应+慢速推理）和锚定强化训练，显著提升推荐系统的性能，仅用0.4%训练数据就超越了现有最佳基线。


<details>

Motivation: 现有推荐系统受限于静态用户建模和被动决策范式，基于大语言模型的代理也存在过度依赖启发式模式匹配的问题，导致浅层相关偏差、有限因果推理和稀疏数据场景下的脆弱性。

Method: 提出STARec框架：将用户建模为具有并行认知的代理（快速响应+链式思维慢速推理）；开发锚定强化训练两阶段范式，结合结构化知识蒸馏和偏好对齐奖励塑造；通过模拟反馈循环实现动态策略适应。

Result: 在MovieLens 1M和Amazon CDs基准测试中，STARec相比最先进基线取得了显著性能提升，尽管仅使用了0.4%的完整训练数据。

Conclusion: STARec通过引入自主审慎推理能力，成功解决了传统推荐系统的局限性，为推荐系统提供了更强大的因果推理和稀疏数据处理能力。

Abstract: While modern recommender systems are instrumental in navigating information
abundance, they remain fundamentally limited by static user modeling and
reactive decision-making paradigms. Current large language model (LLM)-based
agents inherit these shortcomings through their overreliance on heuristic
pattern matching, yielding recommendations prone to shallow correlation bias,
limited causal inference, and brittleness in sparse-data scenarios. We
introduce STARec, a slow-thinking augmented agent framework that endows
recommender systems with autonomous deliberative reasoning capabilities. Each
user is modeled as an agent with parallel cognitions: fast response for
immediate interactions and slow reasoning that performs chain-of-thought
rationales. To cultivate intrinsic slow thinking, we develop anchored
reinforcement training - a two-stage paradigm combining structured knowledge
distillation from advanced reasoning models with preference-aligned reward
shaping. This hybrid approach scaffolds agents in acquiring foundational
capabilities (preference summarization, rationale generation) while enabling
dynamic policy adaptation through simulated feedback loops. Experiments on
MovieLens 1M and Amazon CDs benchmarks demonstrate that STARec achieves
substantial performance gains compared with state-of-the-art baselines, despite
using only 0.4% of the full training data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型被整合到专业领域，其在法律等高风险领域的局限性仍未得到充分理解。需要明确AI系统在司法决策中作为可靠推理工具所需具备的核心能力。

Method: 使用IRAC（Issue-Rule-Application-Conclusion）模型作为分析框架，重点关注法律裁决中最具挑战性的阶段：确定适用规则（R）和将规则应用于案件事实（A）。从司法角度解构法律推理的核心要求。

Result: 研究发现，虽然RAG、多智能体系统和神经符号AI等技术可以解决特定挑战，但在需要自由裁量权和透明、可论证推理的任务中仍存在重大挑战。

Conclusion: 当前AI在法律领域最有效的角色是双重角色：作为简单重复案件的高容量助手，以及作为复杂事务中人类专家的复杂"陪练伙伴"。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are being integrated into professional domains,
yet their limitations in high-stakes fields like law remain poorly understood.
This paper defines the core capabilities that an AI system must possess to
function as a reliable reasoning tool in judicial decision-making. Using the
IRAC (Issue-Rule-Application-Conclusion) model as an analytical framework, the
study focuses on the most challenging phases of legal adjudication: determining
the applicable Rule (R) and performing the Application (A) of that rule to the
facts of a case. From a judicial perspective, the analysis deconstructs legal
reasoning into a series of core requirements, including the ability to select
the correct legal framework across jurisdictions, generate sound arguments
based on the doctrine of legal sources, distinguish ratio decidendi from obiter
dictum in case law, resolve ambiguity arising from general clauses like
"reasonableness", manage conflicting legal provisions, and correctly apply the
burden of proof. The paper then maps various AI enhancement mechanisms, such as
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), multi-agent systems, and neuro-symbolic
AI, to these requirements, assessing their potential to bridge the gap between
the probabilistic nature of LLMs and the rigorous, choice-driven demands of
legal interpretation. The findings indicate that while these techniques can
address specific challenges, significant challenges remain, particularly in
tasks requiring discretion and transparent, justifiable reasoning. Our paper
concludes that the most effective current role for AI in law is a dual one: as
a high-volume assistant for simple, repetitive cases and as a sophisticated
"sparring partner" for human experts in complex matters.

Motivation: 标准的单轮静态测试框架无法全面评估大语言模型在复杂任务（如软件工程）上的细微能力，需要更动态、交互式的评估方法来揭示模型的真实性能。

Method: 设计了一种交互式评估协议：将每个任务模型化为需求依赖图，由知道真实解决方案的"面试官"LLM向"面试者"模型提供最小化的针对性提示，帮助其纠正错误并满足目标约束。基于DevAI评测集（55个精选编程任务）进行实验。

Result: 评估结果显示了动态评估的重要性，能够揭示静态测试无法测量的模型系统性弱点，并通过专家注释验证了面试官提示的相关性和有用性。

Conclusion: 动态交互式评估框架对推进协作式代码生成组件的发展具有重要意义，能提供更精细的诊断性见解并发现静态测试无法发现的模型问题。

Abstract: Standard single-turn, static benchmarks fall short in evaluating the nuanced
capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) on complex tasks such as software
engineering. In this work, we propose a novel interactive evaluation framework
that assesses LLMs on multi-requirement programming tasks through structured,
feedback-driven dialogue. Each task is modeled as a requirement dependency
graph, and an ``interviewer'' LLM, aware of the ground-truth solution, provides
minimal, targeted hints to an ``interviewee'' model to help correct errors and
fulfill target constraints. This dynamic protocol enables fine-grained
diagnostic insights into model behavior, uncovering strengths and systematic
weaknesses that static benchmarks fail to measure. We build on DevAI, a
benchmark of 55 curated programming tasks, by adding ground-truth solutions and
evaluating the relevance and utility of interviewer hints through expert
annotation. Our results highlight the importance of dynamic evaluation in
advancing the development of collaborative code-generating agents.

Abstract: Autoformalization is one of the central tasks in formal verification, while
its advancement remains hindered due to the data scarcity and the absence
efficient methods. In this work we propose \textbf{FormaRL}, a simple yet
efficient reinforcement learning framework for autoformalization which only
requires a small amount of unlabeled data. FormaRL integrates syntax check from
Lean compiler and consistency check from large language model to calculate the
reward, and adopts GRPO algorithm to update the formalizer. We also curated a
proof problem dataset from undergraduate-level math materials, named
\textbf{uproof}, in the hope to facilitate the exploration of autoformalization
and theorem proving in advanced math. Experiments show that FormaRL can
increase the pass@1 autoformalization accuracy of Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct by
4 $\sim$ 6x (4.04\% $\to$ 26.15\% on ProofNet and 2.4\% $\to$ 9.6\% on uproof)
with merely 859 unlabeled data. And on uproof our method also achieved a strong
improvement in out-of-distribution performance compared to existing open-source
state-of-the-art autoformalizers on both pass@1 accuracy (6.2\% $\to$ 9.6\%)
and pass@16 accuracy (24.4\% $\to$ 33.6\%). Training code of FormaRL is

TL;DR: CTGraph是一种图级表示学习方法，用于在智能辅导系统中以自监督方式分析学习者的行为和表现，帮助识别困难学生并提供学习旅程的全面视图。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 智能辅导系统在教育中的广泛应用可能无意中加剧学生表现差距，需要通过学生画像来跟踪进度、识别困难学生并减少学生间的差异。

Method: 提出CTGraph图级表示学习方法，以自监督方式分析学生在不同方面的行为和表现，包括内容覆盖、学习强度和概念熟练度等。

Result: 实验证明CTGraph能够提供学生学习旅程的全面视图，识别困难学生，并对不同群体进行比较分析以确定学生何时何地遇到困难。

Conclusion: 该方法为教育工作者提供了对学生学习旅程的丰富洞察，为更有针对性的干预措施铺平了道路。

Abstract: The surge in the adoption of Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITSs) in
education, while being integral to curriculum-based learning, can inadvertently
exacerbate performance gaps. To address this problem, student profiling becomes
crucial for tracking progress, identifying struggling students, and alleviating
disparities among students. Such profiling requires measuring student behaviors
and performance across different aspects, such as content coverage, learning
intensity, and proficiency in different concepts within a learning topic.
  In this study, we introduce CTGraph, a graph-level representation learning
approach to profile learner behaviors and performance in a self-supervised
manner. Our experiments demonstrate that CTGraph can provide a holistic view of
student learning journeys, accounting for different aspects of student
behaviors and performance, as well as variations in their learning paths as
aligned to the curriculum structure. We also show that our approach can
identify struggling students and provide comparative analysis of diverse groups
to pinpoint when and where students are struggling. As such, our approach opens
more opportunities to empower educators with rich insights into student
learning journeys and paves the way for more targeted interventions.

TL;DR: VISION是一个统一的漏洞检测框架，通过LLM生成反事实样本，结合GNN训练和图解释性，有效减少虚假相关性，显著提升检测准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的GNN漏洞检测方法存在训练数据不平衡和标签噪声问题，容易学习到虚假的代码相似性相关性，导致泛化能力差。

Method: 使用LLM生成语义最小修改但标签相反的反事实样本，进行针对性GNN训练，并结合图解释性技术识别关键代码语句。

Result: 在CWE-20漏洞检测中，整体准确率从51.8%提升到97.8%，成对对比准确率从4.5%提升到95.8%，最差组准确率从0.7%提升到85.5%。

Conclusion: VISION框架有效缓解了虚假相关性学习，提高了漏洞检测的鲁棒性和可解释性，推动了可信AI网络安全系统的发展。

Abstract: Automated detection of vulnerabilities in source code is an essential
cybersecurity challenge, underpinning trust in digital systems and services.
Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a promising approach as they can
learn structural and logical code relationships in a data-driven manner.
However, their performance is severely constrained by training data imbalances
and label noise. GNNs often learn 'spurious' correlations from superficial code
similarities, producing detectors that fail to generalize well to unseen
real-world data. In this work, we propose a unified framework for robust and
interpretable vulnerability detection, called VISION, to mitigate spurious
correlations by systematically augmenting a counterfactual training dataset.
Counterfactuals are samples with minimal semantic modifications but opposite
labels. Our framework includes: (i) generating counterfactuals by prompting a
Large Language Model (LLM); (ii) targeted GNN training on paired code examples
with opposite labels; and (iii) graph-based interpretability to identify the
crucial code statements relevant for vulnerability predictions while ignoring
spurious ones. We find that VISION reduces spurious learning and enables more
robust, generalizable detection, improving overall accuracy (from 51.8% to
97.8%), pairwise contrast accuracy (from 4.5% to 95.8%), and worst-group
accuracy (from 0.7% to 85.5%) on the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE)-20
vulnerability. We further demonstrate gains using proposed metrics: intra-class
attribution variance, inter-class attribution distance, and node score
dependency. We also release CWE-20-CFA, a benchmark of 27,556 functions (real
and counterfactual) from the high-impact CWE-20 category. Finally, VISION
advances transparent and trustworthy AI-based cybersecurity systems through
interactive visualization for human-in-the-loop analysis.

Motivation: 神经网络存在幻觉效应、训练推理计算复杂度高、微调成本大、灾难性遗忘等根本性限制，阻碍了在医疗、工业管理、科学研究等关键领域的应用。

Method: 采用基于层次聚类结构的k近邻算法，利用Kohonen自组织映射构建树状数据结构来加速近邻搜索，简化模型扩展和微调过程。

Conclusion: 该方法具有透明性和可解释性，与人类认知机制高度契合，在需要高可靠性和可解释结果的任务中具有广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: Modern neural network technologies, including large language models, have
achieved remarkable success in various applied artificial intelligence
applications, however, they face a range of fundamental limitations. Among them
are hallucination effects, high computational complexity of training and
inference, costly fine-tuning, and catastrophic forgetting issues. These
limitations significantly hinder the use of neural networks in critical areas
such as medicine, industrial process management, and scientific research. This
article proposes an alternative approach based on the nearest neighbors method
with hierarchical clustering structures. Employing the k-nearest neighbors
algorithm significantly reduces or completely eliminates hallucination effects
while simplifying model expansion and fine-tuning without the need for
retraining the entire network. To overcome the high computational load of the
k-nearest neighbors method, the paper proposes using tree-like data structures
based on Kohonen self-organizing maps, thereby greatly accelerating nearest
neighbor searches. Tests conducted on handwritten digit recognition and simple
subtitle translation tasks confirmed the effectiveness of the proposed
approach. With only a slight reduction in accuracy, the nearest neighbor search
time was reduced hundreds of times compared to exhaustive search methods. The
proposed method features transparency and interpretability, closely aligns with
human cognitive mechanisms, and demonstrates potential for extensive use in
tasks requiring high reliability and explainable results.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在消费级边缘硬件上部署MoE模型受限于有限设备内存，需要动态专家卸载。现有方法仅将其视为调度问题，而本文利用专家重要性指导决策。

Method: 基于专家重要性进行决策，用GPU内存中已缓存的相似功能专家替代低重要性激活专家；引入最大化GPU缓存专家重用率的调度策略。

Result: 实验评估显示，该方法解码延迟降低48%，专家缓存命中率超过60%，同时保持近乎无损的准确性。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了MoE模型在边缘设备上的内存约束问题，显著提升了效率并保持了模型性能。

Abstract: The Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture has emerged as a key technique for
scaling Large Language Models by activating only a subset of experts per query.
Deploying MoE on consumer-grade edge hardware, however, is constrained by
limited device memory, making dynamic expert offloading essential. Unlike prior
work that treats offloading purely as a scheduling problem, we leverage expert
importance to guide decisions, substituting low-importance activated experts
with functionally similar ones already cached in GPU memory, thereby preserving
accuracy. As a result, this design reduces memory usage and data transfer,
while largely eliminating PCIe overhead. In addition, we introduce a scheduling
policy that maximizes the reuse ratio of GPU-cached experts, further boosting
efficiency. Extensive evaluations show that our approach delivers 48% lower
decoding latency with over 60% expert cache hit rate, while maintaining nearly
lossless accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究社会规范如何被获取和表征，探索语言模型是否仅通过统计学习就能达到复杂的规范理解，而非依赖具身体验

Method: 通过两个研究系统评估多个AI系统预测555个日常场景中人类社交适当性判断的能力，比较模型预测与人类平均判断的接近程度

Result: GPT-4.5在连续尺度上预测集体判断的准确率超过所有人类参与者（第100百分位），其他模型也表现优异：Gemini 2.5 Pro超过98.7%人类，GPT-5超过97.8%，Claude Sonnet 4超过96.0%

Conclusion: 统计学习足以产生复杂的社会认知模型，语言作为文化知识传播的丰富存储库，但模型存在系统性相关错误，表明基于模式的社会理解存在潜在边界

Abstract: A fundamental question in cognitive science concerns how social norms are
acquired and represented. While humans typically learn norms through embodied
social experience, we investigated whether large language models can achieve
sophisticated norm understanding through statistical learning alone. Across two
studies, we systematically evaluated multiple AI systems' ability to predict
human social appropriateness judgments for 555 everyday scenarios by examining
how closely they predicted the average judgment compared to each human
participant. In Study 1, GPT-4.5's accuracy in predicting the collective
judgment on a continuous scale exceeded that of every human participant (100th
percentile). Study 2 replicated this, with Gemini 2.5 Pro outperforming 98.7%
of humans, GPT-5 97.8%, and Claude Sonnet 4 96.0%. Despite this predictive
power, all models showed systematic, correlated errors. These findings
demonstrate that sophisticated models of social cognition can emerge from
statistical learning over linguistic data alone, challenging strong versions of
theories emphasizing the exclusive necessity of embodied experience for
cultural competence. The systematic nature of AI limitations across different
architectures indicates potential boundaries of pattern-based social
understanding, while the models' ability to outperform nearly all individual
humans in this predictive task suggests that language serves as a remarkably
rich repository for cultural knowledge transmission.

Motivation: 随着AI向通用智能发展，需要从静态任务优化转向创建能够持续学习的开放式代理体，实现真正意义上的终身学习能力。

Method: 框架基于四大核心原则：经验探索、长期记忆、技能学习和知识内化。同时提出StuLife标准数据集，模拟大学生全面发展过程，包含三个核心阶段和十个详细子场景。

Result: 构建了一个完整的终身学习能力评估平台，能够测试记忆保持、技能迁移和自主行为等关键指标。对现有最先进的大语言模型进行了评测。

Conclusion: 该研究为建立自我迭代的智能体系提供了重要框架，通过经验驱动的学习模式和实际应用场景，推动了通用人工智能的发展进程。

Abstract: As AI advances toward general intelligence, the focus is shifting from
systems optimized for static tasks to creating open-ended agents that learn
continuously. In this paper, we introduce Experience-driven Lifelong Learning
(ELL), a framework for building self-evolving agents capable of continuous
growth through real-world interaction. The framework is built on four core
principles: (1) Experience Exploration: Agents learn through continuous,
self-motivated interaction with dynamic environments, navigating interdependent
tasks and generating rich experiential trajectories. (2) Long-term Memory:
Agents preserve and structure historical knowledge, including personal
experiences, domain expertise, and commonsense reasoning, into a persistent
memory system. (3) Skill Learning: Agents autonomously improve by abstracting
recurring patterns from experience into reusable skills, which are actively
refined and validated for application in new tasks. (4) Knowledge
Internalization: Agents internalize explicit and discrete experiences into
implicit and intuitive capabilities as "second nature".
  We also introduce StuLife, a benchmark dataset for ELL that simulates a
student's holistic college journey, from enrollment to academic and personal
development, across three core phases and ten detailed sub-scenarios. StuLife
is designed around three key paradigm shifts: From Passive to Proactive, From
Context to Memory, and From Imitation to Learning. In this dynamic environment,
agents must acquire and distill practical skills and maintain persistent memory
to make decisions based on evolving state variables. StuLife provides a
comprehensive platform for evaluating lifelong learning capabilities, including
memory retention, skill transfer, and self-motivated behavior. Beyond
evaluating SOTA LLMs on the StuLife benchmark, we also explore the role of
context engineering in advancing AGI.

Motivation: 探索大型语言模型在现象学定性分析中的能力，特别是对边缘型人格障碍这种时间和自我障碍的定性分析，旨在评估AI辅助分析能否减轻人类解释偏见。

Method: 基于24名住院患者的生活故事访谈，让三种LLM模仿原始研究者的解释风格，通过盲法和非盲法专家评估语义一致性、Jaccard系数和多维效度评分。

Result: 模型与人类分析的重合度差异较大（GPT 0%、Claude 42%、Gemini 58%），Jaccard系数较低（0.21-0.28），但模型发现了人类遗漏的主题。Gemini的效度评分显著高于其他模型，且被盲法专家判断为人类分析。

Conclusion: AI增强的主题分析具有变异性但潜力巨大，能够发现人类分析中遗漏的主题，有助于减轻人类解释偏见，特别是在现象学定性分析领域。

Abstract: This study examines the capacity of large language models (LLMs) to support
phenomenological qualitative analysis of first-person experience in Borderline
Personality Disorder (BPD), understood as a disorder of temporality and
selfhood. Building on a prior human-led thematic analysis of 24 inpatients'
life-story interviews, we compared three LLMs (OpenAI GPT-4o, Google Gemini 2.5
Pro, Anthropic Claude Opus 4) prompted to mimic the interpretative style of the
original investigators. The models were evaluated with blinded and non-blinded
expert judges in phenomenology and clinical psychology. Assessments included
semantic congruence, Jaccard coefficients, and multidimensional validity
ratings (credibility, coherence, substantiveness, and groundness in data).
Results showed variable overlap with the human analysis, from 0 percent in GPT
to 42 percent in Claude and 58 percent in Gemini, and a low Jaccard coefficient
(0.21-0.28). However, the models recovered themes omitted by humans. Gemini's
output most closely resembled the human analysis, with validity scores
significantly higher than GPT and Claude (p < 0.0001), and was judged as human
by blinded experts. All scores strongly correlated (R > 0.78) with the quantity
of text and words per theme, highlighting both the variability and potential of
AI-augmented thematic analysis to mitigate human interpretative bias.

Result: 在三个异构数据集上验证，平均R²为0.9213，平均RMSE为0.0584，优于回归、NLP和IRT等基线方法。

Conclusion: 该方法领域无关、自监督，可扩展到任何有解题交互数据的领域，支持维果茨基最近发展区理论，平衡挑战性与可达性。

Abstract: The evolution of technology and education is driving the emergence of
Intelligent & Autonomous Tutoring Systems (IATS), where objective and
domain-agnostic methods for determining question difficulty are essential.
Traditional human labeling is subjective, and existing NLP-based approaches
fail in symbolic domains like algebra. This study introduces the Approach of
Passive Measures among Educands (APME), a reinforcement learning-based
Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) framework that estimates difficulty solely from solver
performance data -- marks obtained and time taken -- without requiring
linguistic features or expert labels. By leveraging the inverse coefficient of
variation as a risk-adjusted metric, the model provides an explainable and
scalable mechanism for adaptive assessment. Empirical validation was conducted
on three heterogeneous datasets. Across these diverse contexts, the model
achieved an average R2 of 0.9213 and an average RMSE of 0.0584, confirming its
robustness, accuracy, and adaptability to different educational levels and
assessment formats. Compared with baseline approaches-such as regression-based,
NLP-driven, and IRT models-the proposed framework consistently outperformed
alternatives, particularly in purely symbolic domains. The findings highlight
that (i) item heterogeneity strongly influences perceived difficulty, and (ii)
variance in solver outcomes is as critical as mean performance for adaptive
allocation. Pedagogically, the model aligns with Vygotskys Zone of Proximal
Development by identifying tasks that balance challenge and attainability,
supporting motivation while minimizing disengagement. This domain-agnostic,
self-supervised approach advances difficulty tagging in IATS and can be
extended beyond algebra wherever solver interaction data is available

Method: 引入黑盒交互评估范式，定义黑盒为隐藏的输入输出映射函数，要求LLMs通过有限次交互来推断隐藏函数，并构建了包含6类任务、96个黑盒的Oracle基准

Result: 测试了19个现代LLM，o3在6个任务中的5个排名第一，在简单黑盒上准确率超过70%，但在困难任务上平均性能低于40%

Conclusion: LLMs普遍缺乏高级规划能力来制定高效自适应的探索策略进行假设精炼，这是当前模型的主要局限性

Abstract: Existing tasks fall short in evaluating reasoning ability of Large Language
Models (LLMs) in an interactive, unknown environment. This deficiency leads to
the isolated assessment of deductive, inductive, and abductive reasoning,
neglecting the integrated reasoning process that is indispensable for humans
discovery of real world. We introduce a novel evaluation paradigm,
\textit{black-box interaction}, to tackle this challenge. A black-box is
defined by a hidden function that maps a specific set of inputs to outputs.
LLMs are required to unravel the hidden function behind the black-box by
interacting with it in given exploration turns, and reasoning over observed
input-output pairs. Leveraging this idea, we build the \textsc{Oracle}
benchmark which comprises 6 types of black-box task and 96 black-boxes. 19
modern LLMs are benchmarked. o3 ranks first in 5 of the 6 tasks, achieving over
70\% accuracy on most easy black-boxes. But it still struggles with some hard
black-box tasks, where its average performance drops below 40\%. Further
analysis indicates a universal difficulty among LLMs: They lack the high-level
planning capability to develop efficient and adaptive exploration strategies
for hypothesis refinement.

Conclusion: 该框架是Minsky"心智社会"理论的实际实现，为人工智能研究开辟了新途径，支持复杂认知能力从简单交互中产生的观点。

Abstract: We introduce the Concurrent Modular Agent (CMA), a framework that
orchestrates multiple Large-Language-Model (LLM)-based modules that operate
fully asynchronously yet maintain a coherent and fault-tolerant behavioral
loop. This framework addresses long-standing difficulties in agent
architectures by letting intention emerge from language-mediated interactions
among autonomous processes. This approach enables flexible, adaptive, and
context-dependent behavior through the combination of concurrently executed
modules that offload reasoning to an LLM, inter-module communication, and a
single shared global state.We consider this approach to be a practical
realization of Minsky's Society of Mind theory. We demonstrate the viability of
our system through two practical use-case studies. The emergent properties
observed in our system suggest that complex cognitive phenomena like
self-awareness may indeed arise from the organized interaction of simpler
processes, supporting Minsky-Society of Mind concept and opening new avenues
for artificial intelligence research. The source code for our work is available

Motivation: 现有后训练方法在复杂任务的深度程序逻辑捕获上仍有不足，研究发现训练数据难度与模型性能存在U型关系（Scaling Law by Difficulty），过度简单数据阻碍抽象能力，而高难度数据显著增强推理能力。

Method: 提出结构化解决方案模板(SST)框架：1)使用结构化解决方案模板链进行微调，动态加权损失优先处理程序逻辑；2)推理时注入解决方案模板作为认知支架；3)集成课程微调，明确教导模型自我规划-执行-自我纠正。

Result: 在GSM8K、AIME24和新的Dynamic En基准测试中，SST显著提高了准确性和效率，特别是在更难的问题上表现突出。

Conclusion: SST框架通过结构化模板和难度课程有效提升了大语言模型的程序推理能力，为解决复杂数学问题提供了有效方法。

Abstract: Structured, procedural reasoning is essential for Large Language Models
(LLMs), especially in mathematics. While post-training methods have improved
LLM performance, they still fall short in capturing deep procedural logic on
complex tasks. To tackle the issue, in this paper, we first investigate this
limitation and uncover a novel finding: a Scaling Law by Difficulty, which
reveals that model performance follows a U-shaped curve with respect to
training data complexity -- excessive low-difficulty data impedes abstraction,
while high-difficulty data significantly enhances reasoning ability. Motivated
by this, we propose the Structured Solution Template (SST) framework, which
uses solution templates and a curriculum of varied difficulty to explicitly
teach procedural reasoning. Specifically, SST comprises (1) fine-tuning with
structured solution-template chains and dynamically weighted loss to prioritize
procedural logic, (2) prompt-time injection of solution templates as cognitive
scaffolds to guide inference, and (3) integrated curriculum fine-tuning that
explicitly teaches the model to self-plan - execute - self-correct. Experiments
on GSM8K, AIME24, and new Dynamic En benchmark show that SST significantly
improves both accuracy and efficiency, especially on harder problems.

MIMIC-III and eICU datasets show TrustEHRAgent outperforms baselines under
strict reliability constraints, achieving improvements of 44.23%p and 25.34%p
at HCAcc@70% while baseline methods fail at these thresholds. These results
highlight limitations of traditional accuracy metrics in evaluating healthcare

Abstract: The emergence of advanced reasoning capabilities in Large Language Models
(LLMs) marks a transformative development in healthcare applications. Beyond
merely expanding functional capabilities, these reasoning mechanisms enhance
decision transparency and explainability-critical requirements in medical
contexts. This survey examines the transformation of medical LLMs from basic
information retrieval tools to sophisticated clinical reasoning systems capable
of supporting complex healthcare decisions. We provide a thorough analysis of
the enabling technological foundations, with a particular focus on specialized
prompting techniques like Chain-of-Thought and recent breakthroughs in
Reinforcement Learning exemplified by DeepSeek-R1. Our investigation evaluates
purpose-built medical frameworks while also examining emerging paradigms such
as multi-agent collaborative systems and innovative prompting architectures.
The survey critically assesses current evaluation methodologies for medical
validation and addresses persistent challenges in field interpretation
limitations, bias mitigation strategies, patient safety frameworks, and
integration of multimodal clinical data. Through this survey, we seek to
establish a roadmap for developing reliable LLMs that can serve as effective
partners in clinical practice and medical research.

### [217] [Hybrid Deep Searcher: Integrating Parallel and Sequential Search Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19113)
*Dayoon Ko,Jihyuk Kim,Haeju Park,Sohyeon Kim,Dahyun Lee,Yongrae Jo,Gunhee Kim,Moontae Lee,Kyungjae Lee*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了HDS-QA数据集和HybridDeepSearcher模型，通过并行和顺序混合查询策略，显著提升大型推理模型的搜索效率和准确性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法采用纯顺序查询会增加推理延迟和上下文长度，降低连贯性和准确性，需要解决并行和顺序查询的混合优化问题

Method: 从Natural Questions自动生成HDS-QA合成数据集，训练LRM区分并行化和顺序查询，包含并行独立子查询和顺序依赖子查询的混合跳问题

Result: 在多个基准测试中优于最先进基线，在FanOutQA和BrowseComp子集上分别提升15.9和11.5 F1分数，以更少搜索轮次达到相当精度

Conclusion: 显式训练LRM利用混合并行和顺序查询策略，证明了效率、可扩展性和有效性的显著提升

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have demonstrated strong performance in
complex, multi-step reasoning tasks. Existing methods enhance LRMs by
sequentially integrating external knowledge retrieval; models iteratively
generate queries, retrieve external information, and progressively reason over
this information. However, purely sequential querying increases inference
latency and context length, diminishing coherence and potentially reducing
accuracy. To address these limitations, we introduce HDS-QA (Hybrid Deep Search
QA), a synthetic dataset automatically generated from Natural Questions,
explicitly designed to train LRMs to distinguish parallelizable from sequential
queries. HDS-QA comprises hybrid-hop questions that combine parallelizable
independent subqueries (executable simultaneously) and sequentially dependent
subqueries (requiring step-by-step resolution), along with synthetic
reasoning-querying-retrieval paths involving parallel queries. We fine-tune an
LRM using HDS-QA, naming the model HybridDeepSearcher, which outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines across multiple benchmarks, notably achieving +15.9
and +11.5 F1 on FanOutQA and a subset of BrowseComp, respectively, both
requiring comprehensive and exhaustive search. Experimental results highlight
two key advantages: HybridDeepSearcher reaches comparable accuracy with fewer
search turns, significantly reducing inference latency, and it effectively
scales as more turns are permitted. These results demonstrate the efficiency,
scalability, and effectiveness of explicitly training LRMs to leverage hybrid
parallel and sequential querying.

### [218] [Algorithmic Collective Action with Multiple Collectives](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19149)
*Claudio Battiloro,Pietro Greiner,Bret Nestor,Oumaima Amezgar,Francesca Dominici*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了首个多集体算法集体行动（ACA）理论框架，研究多个集体如何通过协调数据修改来影响分类器，分析集体规模和目标一致性的作用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实中的算法集体行动通常是分散的、由多个目标相同但策略不同的集体组成，但现有研究主要关注单一集体场景，需要理论框架来理解多集体协作的影响。

Method: 建立多集体ACA的理论框架，研究多个集体如何在分类任务中植入信号（通过修改特征来偏置分类器学习特定类别关联），分析集体规模和目标对齐的定量关系。

Result: 提供了关于集体规模和目标一致性在影响分类器效果方面的定量分析结果，补充了先前实证研究的发现。

Conclusion: 该框架为多集体算法集体行动的整体研究开辟了道路，有助于更全面地理解用户端通过协调数据修改来影响学习系统的机制。

Abstract: As learning systems increasingly influence everyday decisions, user-side
steering via Algorithmic Collective Action (ACA)-coordinated changes to shared
data-offers a complement to regulator-side policy and firm-side model design.
Although real-world actions have been traditionally decentralized and
fragmented into multiple collectives despite sharing overarching
objectives-with each collective differing in size, strategy, and actionable
goals, most of the ACA literature focused on single collective settings. In
this work, we present the first theoretical framework for ACA with multiple
collectives acting on the same system. In particular, we focus on collective
action in classification, studying how multiple collectives can plant signals,
i.e., bias a classifier to learn an association between an altered version of
the features and a chosen, possibly overlapping, set of target classes. We
provide quantitative results about the role and the interplay of collectives'
sizes and their alignment of goals. Our framework, by also complementing
previous empirical results, opens a path for a holistic treatment of ACA with
multiple collectives.

### [219] [Playstyle and Artificial Intelligence: An Initial Blueprint Through the Lens of Video Games](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19152)
*Chiu-Chou Lin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文提出了游戏风格作为分析智能体决策行为的新视角，构建了风格形成的双层框架，并提出了可衡量的风格指标，探索了在强化学习和模仿学习中生成特定风格的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI发展主要关注理性决策，但现实世界中智能体的决策还受到信念、价值观等深层因素的影响，风格是智能中被忽视的重要维度。

Method: 构建风格形成的双层框架（外部环境交互循环和内部认知思考循环），提出风格容量、风格流行度等可衡量指标，研究强化学习和模仿学习生成特定风格的方法。

Result: 提出了基于离散状态空间的通用游戏风格度量方法，能够量化策略多样性和竞争平衡，开发了人类风格学习和建模的新方法。

Conclusion: 风格应作为构建人工通用智能（AGI）的核心要素，该研究为游戏设计和交互娱乐等领域的应用提供了理论基础和技术支持。

Abstract: Contemporary artificial intelligence (AI) development largely centers on
rational decision-making, valued for its measurability and suitability for
objective evaluation. Yet in real-world contexts, an intelligent agent's
decisions are shaped not only by logic but also by deeper influences such as
beliefs, values, and preferences. The diversity of human decision-making styles
emerges from these differences, highlighting that "style" is an essential but
often overlooked dimension of intelligence.
  This dissertation introduces playstyle as an alternative lens for observing
and analyzing the decision-making behavior of intelligent agents, and examines
its foundational meaning and historical context from a philosophical
perspective. By analyzing how beliefs and values drive intentions and actions,
we construct a two-tier framework for style formation: the external interaction
loop with the environment and the internal cognitive loop of deliberation. On
this basis, we formalize style-related characteristics and propose measurable
indicators such as style capacity, style popularity, and evolutionary dynamics.
  The study focuses on three core research directions: (1) Defining and
measuring playstyle, proposing a general playstyle metric based on discretized
state spaces, and extending it to quantify strategic diversity and competitive
balance; (2) Expressing and generating playstyle, exploring how reinforcement
learning and imitation learning can be used to train agents exhibiting specific
stylistic tendencies, and introducing a novel approach for human-like style
learning and modeling; and (3) Practical applications, analyzing the potential
of these techniques in domains such as game design and interactive
entertainment.
  Finally, the dissertation outlines future extensions, including the role of
style as a core element in building artificial general intelligence (AGI).

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MATRIX是一个用于临床对话系统安全评估的多智能体仿真框架，整合了安全对齐的场景分类、基于LLM的评估器和模拟患者代理，实现了系统化、可扩展的安全评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大语言模型临床对话系统评估主要关注任务完成度和流畅性，缺乏对安全关键系统所需的行为和风险管理要求的深入分析。

Method: MATRIX框架包含三个核心组件：1) 基于安全工程方法的安全对齐场景分类法；2) BehvJudge基于LLM的对话失败检测评估器；3) PatBot模拟患者代理。通过多实验验证框架有效性。

Result: BehvJudge评估器达到专家级危险检测水平(F1 0.96，灵敏度0.999)，在240个对话的盲评中优于临床医生。PatBot能可靠模拟真实患者行为。在2,100个模拟对话中成功对5个LLM代理进行基准测试。

Conclusion: MATRIX是首个将结构化安全工程与可扩展、经验证的对话AI评估相统一的框架，支持监管机构对齐的安全审计，为临床对话系统的安全评估提供了系统化解决方案。

Abstract: Despite the growing use of large language models (LLMs) in clinical dialogue
systems, existing evaluations focus on task completion or fluency, offering
little insight into the behavioral and risk management requirements essential
for safety-critical systems. This paper presents MATRIX (Multi-Agent simulaTion
fRamework for safe Interactions and conteXtual clinical conversational
evaluation), a structured, extensible framework for safety-oriented evaluation
of clinical dialogue agents.
  MATRIX integrates three components: (1) a safety-aligned taxonomy of clinical
scenarios, expected system behaviors and failure modes derived through
structured safety engineering methods; (2) BehvJudge, an LLM-based evaluator
for detecting safety-relevant dialogue failures, validated against expert
clinician annotations; and (3) PatBot, a simulated patient agent capable of
producing diverse, scenario-conditioned responses, evaluated for realism and
behavioral fidelity with human factors expertise, and a patient-preference
study.
  Across three experiments, we show that MATRIX enables systematic, scalable
safety evaluation. BehvJudge with Gemini 2.5-Pro achieves expert-level hazard
detection (F1 0.96, sensitivity 0.999), outperforming clinicians in a blinded
assessment of 240 dialogues. We also conducted one of the first realism
analyses of LLM-based patient simulation, showing that PatBot reliably
simulates realistic patient behavior in quantitative and qualitative
evaluations. Using MATRIX, we demonstrate its effectiveness in benchmarking
five LLM agents across 2,100 simulated dialogues spanning 14 hazard scenarios
and 10 clinical domains.
  MATRIX is the first framework to unify structured safety engineering with
scalable, validated conversational AI evaluation, enabling regulator-aligned
safety auditing. We release all evaluation tools, prompts, structured
scenarios, and datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 重新发挥中世纪Llull组合术的价值，通过符号组合来生成知识，为现代研究创意提供概念基础。

Conclusion: 这种现代思维机器提供了一种轻量级、可解释的工具，用于增强科学创造力，并为人工智能与人类的协作创意指明了方向。

Abstract: This paper revisits Ramon Llull's Ars combinatoria - a medieval framework for
generating knowledge through symbolic recombination - as a conceptual
foundation for building a modern Llull's thinking machine for research
ideation. Our approach defines three compositional axes: Theme (e.g.,
efficiency, adaptivity), Domain (e.g., question answering, machine
translation), and Method (e.g., adversarial training, linear attention). These
elements represent high-level abstractions common in scientific work -
motivations, problem settings, and technical approaches - and serve as building
blocks for LLM-driven exploration. We mine elements from human experts or
conference papers and show that prompting LLMs with curated combinations
produces research ideas that are diverse, relevant, and grounded in current
literature. This modern thinking machine offers a lightweight, interpretable
tool for augmenting scientific creativity and suggests a path toward
collaborative ideation between humans and AI.

TL;DR: 将过程奖励模型从分类任务重构为推理任务，提出StepWiser生成式评判模型，通过元推理输出思考标记和最终判断，在准确性、训练改进和推理搜索方面优于现有方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有过程奖励模型存在两大缺陷：作为分类器不提供解释，且依赖静态数据集监督微调限制了泛化能力。需要开发能推理中间步骤逻辑有效性的方法

Method: 提出StepWiser生成式评判模型，通过强化学习使用rollout相对结果进行训练，模型对策略模型的推理步骤进行元推理，先输出思考标记再给出最终判断

Result: StepWiser在中间步骤判断准确性上优于现有方法，可用于改进策略模型训练，并提升推理时搜索效果

Conclusion: 将过程奖励建模重构为推理任务的方法有效，生成式评判模型StepWiser在多个维度上优于传统的分类器式方法

Abstract: As models increasingly leverage multi-step reasoning strategies to solve
complex problems, supervising the logical validity of these intermediate steps
has become a critical research challenge. Process reward models address this by
providing step-by-step feedback, but current approaches have two major
drawbacks: they typically function as classifiers without providing
explanations, and their reliance on supervised fine-tuning with static datasets
limits generalization. Inspired by recent advances, we reframe stepwise reward
modeling from a classification task to a reasoning task itself. We thus propose
a generative judge that reasons about the policy model's reasoning steps (i.e.,
meta-reasons), outputting thinking tokens before delivering a final verdict.
Our model, StepWiser, is trained by reinforcement learning using relative
outcomes of rollouts. We show it provides (i) better judgment accuracy on
intermediate steps than existing methods; (ii) can be used to improve the
policy model at training time; and (iii) improves inference-time search.

TL;DR: 本调查首次系统研究模型上下文协议(MCP)作为统一范式，分析其连接协议级适应与上下文感知决策的能力，提出五类分类法并揭示三个关键发现，最后提出将MCP作为下一代自适应智能交通基础设施基础的研究路线图。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 互联设备、自主系统和AI应用的快速扩张导致自适应交通系统严重碎片化，不同协议和上下文来源相互隔离，需要统一的集成框架来解决这一问题。

Method: 通过分析现有文献，提出五类分类法（自适应机制、上下文感知框架、统一模型、集成策略和MCP架构），系统调查MCP作为统一范式的能力。

Result: 发现三个关键见解：传统传输协议已达到孤立适应的极限；MCP的客户端-服务器和JSON-RPC结构支持语义互操作性；AI驱动的交通需要MCP特有的集成范式。

Conclusion: MCP为下一代自适应、上下文感知和智能交通基础设施提供了基础框架，代表了从碎片化解决方案向标准化集成框架的自然演进。

Abstract: The rapid expansion of interconnected devices, autonomous systems, and AI
applications has created severe fragmentation in adaptive transport systems,
where diverse protocols and context sources remain isolated. This survey
provides the first systematic investigation of the Model Context Protocol (MCP)
as a unifying paradigm, highlighting its ability to bridge protocol-level
adaptation with context-aware decision making. Analyzing established
literature, we show that existing efforts have implicitly converged toward
MCP-like architectures, signaling a natural evolution from fragmented solutions
to standardized integration frameworks. We propose a five-category taxonomy
covering adaptive mechanisms, context-aware frameworks, unification models,
integration strategies, and MCP-enabled architectures. Our findings reveal
three key insights: traditional transport protocols have reached the limits of
isolated adaptation, MCP's client-server and JSON-RPC structure enables
semantic interoperability, and AI-driven transport demands integration
paradigms uniquely suited to MCP. Finally, we present a research roadmap
positioning MCP as a foundation for next-generation adaptive, context-aware,
and intelligent transport infrastructures.
