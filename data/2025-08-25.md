### [1] [Text-Driven 3D Hand Motion Generation from Sign Language Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15902)
*Léore Bensabath,Mathis Petrovich,Gül Varol*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出HandMDM，一个基于文本描述的3D手部动作生成模型，通过大规模手语视频数据和LLM生成的文本标注进行训练，在跨领域场景中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目标是训练一个能够根据自然语言描述生成3D手部动作的生成模型，这些描述指定了手形、位置、手指/手/手臂运动等特征，以支持手语研究和手部动作生成领域的发展。

Method: 利用大规模手语视频数据集和噪声伪标注的手语类别，通过LLM将手语属性词典和运动脚本线索转换为手部运动描述，构建文本-动作配对数据，训练文本条件化的手部动作扩散模型HandMDM。

Result: 模型在多个领域表现出鲁棒性，包括同一手语中未见的手语类别、另一手语的手语动作以及非手语手部运动，展示了跨领域的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该方法为3D手部动作生成提供了有效的解决方案，通过大规模数据和LLM辅助标注实现了跨领域的鲁棒性能，为这一新兴领域的未来研究提供了重要基础。

Abstract: Our goal is to train a generative model of 3D hand motions, conditioned on
natural language descriptions specifying motion characteristics such as
handshapes, locations, finger/hand/arm movements. To this end, we automatically
build pairs of 3D hand motions and their associated textual labels with
unprecedented scale. Specifically, we leverage a large-scale sign language
video dataset, along with noisy pseudo-annotated sign categories, which we
translate into hand motion descriptions via an LLM that utilizes a dictionary
of sign attributes, as well as our complementary motion-script cues. This data
enables training a text-conditioned hand motion diffusion model HandMDM, that
is robust across domains such as unseen sign categories from the same sign
language, but also signs from another sign language and non-sign hand
movements. We contribute extensive experimental investigation of these
scenarios and will make our trained models and data publicly available to
support future research in this relatively new field.

### [2] [VT-LVLM-AR: A Video-Temporal Large Vision-Language Model Adapter for Fine-Grained Action Recognition in Long-Term Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15903)
*Kaining Li,Shuwei He,Zihan Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VT-LVLM-AR是一个新颖的视频动作识别框架，通过视频到事件映射器和LVLM推理模块，在长视频中实现了最先进的性能表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决长视频动作识别中传统深度学习模型的计算开销大、难以捕捉长程时序依赖和语义理解有限的问题，探索大型视觉语言模型在细粒度动作识别中的应用。

Method: 使用Video-to-Event Mapper将原始视频转换为紧凑的视觉事件序列，然后通过参数高效的Prompt Tuning适配冻结的LLaVA-1.5模型进行动作分类。

Result: 在NTU RGB+D和NTU RGB+D 120数据集上达到最先进性能（NTU RGB+D X-Sub准确率94.1%），消融研究验证了各组件的重要性。

Conclusion: 该工作展示了通过有效的视频到语言转换和高效模型适配，利用LVLMs实现鲁棒且可解释的视频动作理解的巨大潜力。

Abstract: Human action recognition in long-term videos, characterized by complex
backgrounds and subtle action differences, poses significant challenges for
traditional deep learning models due to computational overhead, difficulty in
capturing long-range temporal dependencies, and limited semantic understanding.
While Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs)
have shown remarkable capabilities in multi-modal understanding and reasoning,
their direct application to continuous video streams for fine-grained action
recognition remains an open problem. This paper introduces VT-LVLM-AR
(Video-Temporal Large Vision-Language Model Adapter for Action Recognition), a
novel framework designed to bridge this gap. VT-LVLM-AR comprises a
Video-to-Event Mapper (VTEM) that efficiently transforms raw video into
compact, semantically rich, and temporally coherent "visual event sequences"
through lightweight spatio-temporal feature extraction, adaptive temporal
pooling, and conceptual quantization with an event coherence bias. These visual
event sequences are then fed into an LVLM-based Action Reasoning module,
specifically a frozen LLaVA-1.5 model, adapted using parameter-efficient Prompt
Tuning (P-Tuning v2) for action classification. Comprehensive evaluations on
the NTU RGB+D and NTU RGB+D 120 datasets demonstrate that VT-LVLM-AR
consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance, surpassing existing methods
(e.g., 94.1% accuracy on NTU RGB+D X-Sub). Ablation studies confirm the
critical contributions of VTEM's components and the efficacy of Prompt Tuning,
while human evaluations underscore the interpretability of our visual event
representations. This work highlights the immense potential of leveraging LVLMs
for robust and interpretable video action understanding through effective
video-to-language translation and efficient model adaptation.

### [3] [Boosting Pathology Foundation Models via Few-shot Prompt-tuning for Rare Cancer Subtyping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15904)
*Dexuan He,Xiao Zhou,Wenbin Guan,Liyuan Zhang,Xiaoman Zhang,Sinuo Xu,Ge Wang,Lifeng Wang,Xiaojun Yuan,Xin Sun,Yanfeng Wang,Kun Sun,Ya Zhang,Weidi Xie*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PathPT是一个新颖的病理视觉语言框架，通过空间感知视觉聚合和任务特定提示调优，充分利用视觉语言病理基础模型的潜力，在罕见癌症亚型分类和定位方面取得显著性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 罕见癌症占所有恶性肿瘤的20-25%，但在诊断方面面临重大挑战，特别是在儿科肿瘤学中占比超过70%。现有的多实例学习方法仅依赖视觉特征，忽视了跨模态知识，影响了罕见癌症诊断的可解释性。

Method: 提出PathPT框架，通过空间感知视觉聚合和任务特定提示调优，将WSI级监督转换为细粒度tile级指导，利用VL模型的零样本能力保持癌变区域定位，并通过与组织病理学语义对齐的提示实现跨模态推理。

Result: 在8个罕见癌症数据集（56个亚型，2910个WSI）和3个常见癌症数据集上评估，PathPT在few-shot设置下始终提供卓越性能，在亚型分类准确性和癌变区域定位能力方面实现显著提升。

Conclusion: PathPT推进了AI辅助罕见癌症诊断，为在专业专业知识有限的环境中提高亚型分类准确性提供了可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Rare cancers comprise 20-25% of all malignancies but face major diagnostic
challenges due to limited expert availability-especially in pediatric oncology,
where they represent over 70% of cases. While pathology vision-language (VL)
foundation models show promising zero-shot capabilities for common cancer
subtyping, their clinical performance for rare cancers remains limited.
Existing multi-instance learning (MIL) methods rely only on visual features,
overlooking cross-modal knowledge and compromising interpretability critical
for rare cancer diagnosis. To address this limitation, we propose PathPT, a
novel framework that fully exploits the potential of vision-language pathology
foundation models through spatially-aware visual aggregation and task-specific
prompt tuning. Unlike conventional MIL, PathPT converts WSI-level supervision
into fine-grained tile-level guidance by leveraging the zero-shot capabilities
of VL models, thereby preserving localization on cancerous regions and enabling
cross-modal reasoning through prompts aligned with histopathological semantics.
We benchmark PathPT on eight rare cancer datasets(four adult and four
pediatric) spanning 56 subtypes and 2,910 WSIs, as well as three common cancer
datasets, evaluating four state-of-the-art VL models and four MIL frameworks
under three few-shot settings. Results show that PathPT consistently delivers
superior performance, achieving substantial gains in subtyping accuracy and
cancerous region grounding ability. This work advances AI-assisted diagnosis
for rare cancers, offering a scalable solution for improving subtyping accuracy
in settings with limited access to specialized expertise.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有船舶检测方法难以捕获细粒度语义信息，在复杂场景下效果有限，需要新的解决方案来提升海事活动监控、航运物流和环境研究等应用的效果

Method: 结合视觉语言模型(VLMs)与多尺度自适应滑动窗口策略，构建专门的ShipSem-VL视觉语言数据集来捕获细粒度船舶属性

Result: 通过三个明确定义的任务评估框架性能，从多角度全面分析证明了该方法的有效性

Conclusion: 提出的框架有效推进了语义感知船舶检测(SASD)的发展，为复杂场景下的船舶检测提供了更先进的解决方案

Abstract: Ship detection in remote sensing imagery is a critical task with wide-ranging
applications, such as maritime activity monitoring, shipping logistics, and
environmental studies. However, existing methods often struggle to capture
fine-grained semantic information, limiting their effectiveness in complex
scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose a novel detection framework
that combines Vision-Language Models (VLMs) with a multi-scale adaptive sliding
window strategy. To facilitate Semantic-Aware Ship Detection (SASD), we
introduce ShipSem-VL, a specialized Vision-Language dataset designed to capture
fine-grained ship attributes. We evaluate our framework through three
well-defined tasks, providing a comprehensive analysis of its performance and
demonstrating its effectiveness in advancing SASD from multiple perspectives.

*Jiawen Lyu,Manu Ramesh,Madison Simonds,Jacquelyn P. Boerman,Amy R. Reibman*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 基于视频的手权免操作奶牛识别系统，包含自动编目、无深度学习识别和连续视频检测功能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺少能够手权免操作自动化识别和编目奶牛的视频系统

Method: 系统包含三部分：AutoCattloger（用单个视频快照构建牛群编目）、eidetic cow recognizer（无深度学习的牛识别器）和CowFinder（连续视频流中识别牛）

Result: 系统能够在无标签、未分割的视频中识别自由行走在擦牛厂挂保区的个体奶牛

Conclusion: 该系统为奶牛管理提供了一种高效、自动化的视觉识别方案，适用于实际生产环境

Abstract: Few automated video systems are described in the open literature that enable
hands-free cataloging and identification (ID) of cows in a dairy herd. In this
work, we describe our system, composed of an AutoCattloger, which builds a
Cattlog of dairy cows in a herd with a single input video clip per cow, an
eidetic cow recognizer which uses no deep learning to ID cows, and a CowFinder,
which IDs cows in a continuous stream of video. We demonstrate its value in
finding individuals in unlabeled, unsegmented videos of cows walking
unconstrained through the holding area of a milking parlor.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 物种分布模型能够编码物种出现的空间模式，当有位置信息时可以作为视觉物种分类的有效先验

Method: 使用SINR（空间隐式神经表示）模型作为地理先验，评估不同模型配置，调整对未训练物种预测的处理方式

Result: 分析揭示了影响这些模型作为地理先验有效性的因素，这些因素可能与制作准确分布图的考量不同

Conclusion: SINR模型可以作为有效的视觉物种分类地理先验，但需要针对分类任务优化配置和处理策略

Abstract: Species distribution models encode spatial patterns of species occurrence
making them effective priors for vision-based species classification when
location information is available. In this study, we evaluate various SINR
(Spatial Implicit Neural Representations) models as a geographical prior for
visual classification of species from iNaturalist observations. We explore the
impact of different model configurations and adjust how we handle predictions
for species not included in Geo Prior training. Our analysis reveals factors
that contribute to the effectiveness of these models as Geo Priors, factors
that may differ from making accurate range maps.

### [7] [Representation Learning with Adaptive Superpixel Coding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15959)
*Mahmoud Khalil,Ahmad Khalil,Alioune Ngom*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出基于Transformer的自监督模型ASC，通过自适应超像素层动态调整图像内容分区，克服传统ViT固定大小patch分区的局限性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统视觉模型依赖特定模态和领域假设（如网格结构），Vision Transformers使用固定大小的patch分区存在局限性，需要更适应图像内容的方法

Method: 采用自适应超像素层替代固定patch分区，使模型能够根据底层图像内容动态调整分区策略，基于Transformer架构构建自监督模型

Result: 在标准图像下游任务基准测试中表现优于广泛使用的替代方法

Conclusion: 自适应超像素编码方法有效克服了传统视觉Transformer的固定分区限制，为视觉模型提供了更灵活和适应性的表示学习方式

Abstract: Deep learning vision models are typically tailored for specific modalities
and often rely on domain-specific assumptions, such as the grid structures used
by nearly all existing vision models. In this work, we propose a
self-supervised model based on Transformers, which we call Adaptive Superpixel
Coding (ASC). The key insight of our model is to overcome the limitations of
traditional Vision Transformers, which depend on fixed-size and non-adaptive
patch partitioning. Instead, ASC employs adaptive superpixel layers that
dynamically adjust to the underlying image content. We analyze key properties
of the approach that make it effective, and find that our method outperforms
widely-used alternatives on standard image downstream task benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉-语言模型在病理学领域展示了潜力，但在细粒度的疾病特定分类任务中效果有限，特别是在医学形态学变化微妙且需要与临床术语对齐的肾病理学诊断中

Method: 提出Glo-VLMs框架，利用细选的病理图像和临床文本提示进行联合图像-文本表征学习，评估多种VLM架构和适配策略在少量标签数据情况下的表现

Result: 细调VLM模型在每类仅8个标签样本的情况下实现了0.7416的准确率、0.9045的宏观AUC和0.5277的F1分数

Conclusion: 基础模型即使在极其有限的监督信息下也能有效地适配于细粒度的医学图像分类任务，为专业临床研究应用提供了实践可行性

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have shown considerable potential in digital
pathology, yet their effectiveness remains limited for fine-grained,
disease-specific classification tasks such as distinguishing between glomerular
subtypes. The subtle morphological variations among these subtypes, combined
with the difficulty of aligning visual patterns with precise clinical
terminology, make automated diagnosis in renal pathology particularly
challenging. In this work, we explore how large pretrained VLMs can be
effectively adapted to perform fine-grained glomerular classification, even in
scenarios where only a small number of labeled examples are available. In this
work, we introduce Glo-VLMs, a systematic framework designed to explore the
adaptation of VLMs to fine-grained glomerular classification in
data-constrained settings. Our approach leverages curated pathology images
alongside clinical text prompts to facilitate joint image-text representation
learning for nuanced renal pathology subtypes. By assessing various VLMs
architectures and adaptation strategies under a few-shot learning paradigm, we
explore how both the choice of method and the amount of labeled data impact
model performance in clinically relevant scenarios. To ensure a fair
comparison, we evaluate all models using standardized multi-class metrics,
aiming to clarify the practical requirements and potential of large pretrained
models for specialized clinical research applications. As a result, fine-tuning
the VLMs achieved 0.7416 accuracy, 0.9045 macro-AUC, and 0.5277 F1-score with
only 8 shots per class, demonstrating that even with highly limited
supervision, foundation models can be effectively adapted for fine-grained
medical image classification.

Conclusion: 论文总结了标签高效学习的重要贡献，并展望了未来研究方向，重点关注在实际应用中扩展和增强标签高效学习方法。

Abstract: This manuscript presents a series of my selected contributions to the topic
of label-efficient learning in computer vision and remote sensing. The central
focus of this research is to develop and adapt methods that can learn
effectively from limited or partially annotated data, and can leverage abundant
unlabeled data in real-world applications. The contributions span both
methodological developments and domain-specific adaptations, in particular
addressing challenges unique to Earth observation data such as multi-modality,
spatial resolution variability, and scene heterogeneity. The manuscript is
organized around four main axes including (1) weakly supervised learning for
object discovery and detection based on anomaly-aware representations learned
from large amounts of background images; (2) multi-task learning that jointly
trains on multiple datasets with disjoint annotations to improve performance on
object detection and semantic segmentation; (3) self-supervised and supervised
contrastive learning with multimodal data to enhance scene classification in
remote sensing; and (4) few-shot learning for hierarchical scene classification
using both explicit and implicit modeling of class hierarchies. These
contributions are supported by extensive experimental results across natural
and remote sensing datasets, reflecting the outcomes of several collaborative
research projects. The manuscript concludes by outlining ongoing and future
research directions focused on scaling and enhancing label-efficient learning
for real-world applications.

Motivation: 传统CNN模型在沙滩垃圾监测中面临沙滩异质性、颜色反射、人类足迹、阴影、藻类、沙丘等多种干扰，需要更鲁棒的解决方案

Method: 采用基于实例分割和全景分割的CNN方法，这些方法在少量样本情况下仍能保持良好精度

Result: 所提出的分割方法相比基础CNN模型更加鲁棒，减少了干扰因素的影响

Conclusion: 基于实例分割和全景分割的CNN方法更适合处理沙滩垃圾监测中的复杂场景，能够有效提升监测准确性

Abstract: Convolutional neural networks (CNN) have been used efficiently in several
fields, including environmental challenges. In fact, CNN can help with the
monitoring of marine litter, which has become a worldwide problem. UAVs have
higher resolution and are more adaptable in local areas than satellite images,
making it easier to find and count trash. Since the sand is heterogeneous, a
basic CNN model encounters plenty of inferences caused by reflections of sand
color, human footsteps, shadows, algae present, dunes, holes, and tire tracks.
For these types of images, other CNN models, such as CNN-based segmentation
methods, may be more appropriate. In this paper, we use an instance-based
segmentation method and a panoptic segmentation method that show good accuracy
with just a few samples. The model is more robust and less

Motivation: 解决视网膜疾病分类中因患者隐私和高成本导致的大规模专业标注数据稀缺问题，利用合成数据集SynFundus-1M突破这些障碍

Method: 建立一个端到端的深度学习流水线，训练六种现代网络架构(ConvNeXtV2, SwinV2, ViT, ResNet, EfficientNetV2, RETFound)，采用5折多标签分层交叉验证策略，并使用XGBoost分类器建立元集成模型

Result: 集成模型在内部验证集上获得微平均AUC 0.9973的最高性能，在三个真实临床数据集上也表现出强劲的泛化能力：DR数据集AUC 0.7972，AIROGS青光眼数据集AUC 0.9126，RFMiD多标签数据集微平均AUC 0.8800

Conclusion: 这项工作为大规模合成数据集研究提供了健壮的基准性能，证明仅使用合成数据训练的模型能够准确分类多种病理并有效泛化到真实临床图像，为加速眼科完整AI系统开发提供了可行途径

Abstract: The development of multi-label deep learning models for retinal disease
classification is often hindered by the scarcity of large, expertly annotated
clinical datasets due to patient privacy concerns and high costs. The recent
release of SynFundus-1M, a high-fidelity synthetic dataset with over one
million fundus images, presents a novel opportunity to overcome these barriers.
To establish a foundational performance benchmark for this new resource, we
developed an end-to-end deep learning pipeline, training six modern
architectures (ConvNeXtV2, SwinV2, ViT, ResNet, EfficientNetV2, and the
RETFound foundation model) to classify eleven retinal diseases using a 5-fold
multi-label stratified cross-validation strategy. We further developed a
meta-ensemble model by stacking the out-of-fold predictions with an XGBoost
classifier. Our final ensemble model achieved the highest performance on the
internal validation set, with a macro-average Area Under the Receiver Operating
Characteristic Curve (AUC) of 0.9973. Critically, the models demonstrated
strong generalization to three diverse, real-world clinical datasets, achieving
an AUC of 0.7972 on a combined DR dataset, an AUC of 0.9126 on the AIROGS
glaucoma dataset and a macro-AUC of 0.8800 on the multi-label RFMiD dataset.
This work provides a robust baseline for future research on large-scale
synthetic datasets and establishes that models trained exclusively on synthetic
data can accurately classify multiple pathologies and generalize effectively to
real clinical images, offering a viable pathway to accelerate the development
of comprehensive AI systems in ophthalmology.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出基于潜在扩散模型的新方法，通过显式建模非手动特征（面部表情）和手动特征（手部动作）来生成多样化的手语数字化身，在保持语言内容的同时提升视觉质量和多样性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有手语生成模型难以在保持视觉质量的同时捕捉多样性，特别是非手动属性（如情感表达）的建模存在不足。

Method: 使用潜在扩散模型从生成的参考图像合成逼真数字化身，提出新颖的手语特征聚合模块分别建模非手动特征（面部）和手动特征（手部）。

Result: 在YouTube-SL-25数据集上的实验表明，该方法在视觉质量上优于最先进方法，感知指标有显著提升，能够无缝使用不同种族背景的参考图像确保多样性。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法成功解决了手语生成中多样性保持与视觉质量的平衡问题，特别在非手动特征建模方面表现出色，为手语合成提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: The diversity of sign representation is essential for Sign Language
Production (SLP) as it captures variations in appearance, facial expressions,
and hand movements. However, existing SLP models are often unable to capture
diversity while preserving visual quality and modelling non-manual attributes
such as emotions. To address this problem, we propose a novel approach that
leverages Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) to synthesise photorealistic digital
avatars from a generated reference image. We propose a novel sign feature
aggregation module that explicitly models the non-manual features
(\textit{e.g.}, the face) and the manual features (\textit{e.g.}, the hands).
We show that our proposed module ensures the preservation of linguistic content
while seamlessly using reference images with different ethnic backgrounds to
ensure diversity. Experiments on the YouTube-SL-25 sign language dataset show
that our pipeline achieves superior visual quality compared to state-of-the-art
methods, with significant improvements on perceptual metrics.

Abstract: Recent advancements in computer vision and deep learning have enhanced
disaster-response capabilities, particularly in the rapid assessment of
earthquake-affected urban environments. Timely identification of accessible
entry points and structural obstacles is essential for effective
search-and-rescue (SAR) operations. To address this need, we introduce
DRespNeT, a high-resolution dataset specifically developed for aerial instance
segmentation of post-earthquake structural environments. Unlike existing
datasets, which rely heavily on satellite imagery or coarse semantic labeling,
DRespNeT provides detailed polygon-level instance segmentation annotations
derived from high-definition (1080p) aerial footage captured in disaster zones,
including the 2023 Turkiye earthquake and other impacted regions. The dataset
comprises 28 operationally critical classes, including structurally compromised
buildings, access points such as doors, windows, and gaps, multiple debris
levels, rescue personnel, vehicles, and civilian visibility. A distinctive
feature of DRespNeT is its fine-grained annotation detail, enabling
differentiation between accessible and obstructed areas, thereby improving
operational planning and response efficiency. Performance evaluations using
YOLO-based instance segmentation models, specifically YOLOv8-seg, demonstrate
significant gains in real-time situational awareness and decision-making. Our
optimized YOLOv8-DRN model achieves 92.7% mAP50 with an inference speed of 27
FPS on an RTX-4090 GPU for multi-target detection, meeting real-time
operational requirements. The dataset and models support SAR teams and robotic
systems, providing a foundation for enhancing human-robot collaboration,
streamlining emergency response, and improving survivor outcomes.

Abstract: How can we extract complete geometric models of objects that we encounter in
our daily life, without having access to commercial 3D scanners? In this paper
we present an automated system for generating geometric models of objects from
two or more videos. Our system requires the specification of one known point in
at least one frame of each video, which can be automatically determined using a
fiducial marker such as a checkerboard or Augmented Reality (AR) marker. The
remaining frames are automatically positioned in world space by using
Structure-from-Motion techniques. By using multiple videos and merging results,
a complete object mesh can be generated, without having to rely on hole
filling. Code for our system is available from

TL;DR: 提出了CoVeRaP多车雷达协同感知数据集和框架，通过雷达数据融合显著提升3D目标检测性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 车载FMCW雷达在恶劣天气下可靠但点云稀疏嘈杂，限制了3D目标检测性能，需要多车协同来提升感知能力

Method: 构建21k帧多车协同数据集，提出中晚期融合框架，使用多分支PointNet编码器融合空间、多普勒和强度信息，通过自注意力机制生成3D边界框

Result: 强度编码的中期融合将平均精度提升高达9倍（IoU 0.9）， consistently超越单车基线

Conclusion: CoVeRaP建立了首个可复现的多车雷达感知基准，证明经济实惠的雷达共享显著提升检测鲁棒性，数据集和代码已公开

Abstract: Automotive FMCW radars remain reliable in rain and glare, yet their sparse,
noisy point clouds constrain 3-D object detection. We therefore release
CoVeRaP, a 21 k-frame cooperative dataset that time-aligns radar, camera, and
GPS streams from multiple vehicles across diverse manoeuvres. Built on this
data, we propose a unified cooperative-perception framework with middle- and
late-fusion options. Its baseline network employs a multi-branch PointNet-style
encoder enhanced with self-attention to fuse spatial, Doppler, and intensity
cues into a common latent space, which a decoder converts into 3-D bounding
boxes and per-point depth confidence. Experiments show that middle fusion with
intensity encoding boosts mean Average Precision by up to 9x at IoU 0.9 and
consistently outperforms single-vehicle baselines. CoVeRaP thus establishes the
first reproducible benchmark for multi-vehicle FMCW-radar perception and
demonstrates that affordable radar sharing markedly improves detection
robustness. Dataset and code are publicly available to encourage further
research.

### [16] [Wavelet-Enhanced PaDiM for Industrial Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16034)
*Cory Gardner,Byungseok Min,Tae-Hyuk Ahn*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WE-PaDiM通过小波变换增强PaDiM方法，用结构化频率子带选择替代随机通道选择，在MVTec AD数据集上实现了99.32%图像级AUC和92.10%像素级AUC的优异性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PaDiM方法通过随机通道选择降低维度可能丢失结构化信息，需要更原则性的特征选择方法来提升工业图像异常检测性能。

Method: 将离散小波变换与多层CNN特征结合，对特征图应用2D DWT，选择特定频率子带（LL、LH、HL等），空间对齐后通道级联，再用PaDiM的多变量高斯框架建模。

Result: 在MVTec AD数据集上，使用ResNet-18和EfficientNet B0-B6骨干网络，平均达到99.32% Image-AUC和92.10% Pixel-AUC。小波选择影响性能权衡：简单小波（如Haar）配合细节子带提升定位性能，近似子带提升图像级检测。

Conclusion: WE-PaDiM为PaDiM中的随机特征选择提供了竞争性强且可解释的替代方案，在保持相当效率的同时实现了适合工业检测的鲁棒结果。

Abstract: Anomaly detection and localization in industrial images are essential for
automated quality inspection. PaDiM, a prominent method, models the
distribution of normal image features extracted by pre-trained Convolutional
Neural Networks (CNNs) but reduces dimensionality through random channel
selection, potentially discarding structured information. We propose
Wavelet-Enhanced PaDiM (WE-PaDiM), which integrates Discrete Wavelet Transform
(DWT) analysis with multi-layer CNN features in a structured manner. WE-PaDiM
applies 2D DWT to feature maps from multiple backbone layers, selects specific
frequency subbands (e.g., LL, LH, HL), spatially aligns them, and concatenates
them channel-wise before modeling with PaDiM's multivariate Gaussian framework.
This DWT-before-concatenation strategy provides a principled method for feature
selection based on frequency content relevant to anomalies, leveraging
multi-scale wavelet information as an alternative to random selection. We
evaluate WE-PaDiM on the challenging MVTec AD dataset with multiple backbones
(ResNet-18 and EfficientNet B0-B6). The method achieves strong performance in
anomaly detection and localization, yielding average results of 99.32%
Image-AUC and 92.10% Pixel-AUC across 15 categories with per-class optimized
configurations. Our analysis shows that wavelet choices affect performance
trade-offs: simpler wavelets (e.g., Haar) with detail subbands (HL or LH/HL/HH)
often enhance localization, while approximation bands (LL) improve image-level
detection. WE-PaDiM thus offers a competitive and interpretable alternative to
random feature selection in PaDiM, achieving robust results suitable for
industrial inspection with comparable efficiency.

TL;DR: 提出Expandable Residual Approximation (ERA)方法，通过分解残差知识的多步逼近和教师权重重用策略，有效解决知识蒸馏中师生模型能力差距问题，在ImageNet和COCO等基准上取得显著性能提升


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 知识蒸馏中师生模型之间的学习能力差距阻碍了知识的充分传递，需要新的方法来缓解这种能力差异问题

Method: 基于Stone-Weierstrass定理的渐进逼近原理，提出可扩展残差逼近(ERA)方法，使用多分支残差网络(MBRNet)分解残差知识，并引入教师权重集成(TWI)策略重用教师头部权重

Result: 在ImageNet分类基准上Top-1准确率提升1.41%，在MS COCO目标检测基准上AP提升1.40，在计算机视觉任务中达到领先性能

Conclusion: ERA方法通过分解残差知识和重用教师权重，有效解决了知识蒸馏中的能力差距问题，在各种视觉任务中表现出优越性能

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) aims to transfer knowledge from a large-scale
teacher model to a lightweight one, significantly reducing computational and
storage requirements. However, the inherent learning capacity gap between the
teacher and student often hinders the sufficient transfer of knowledge,
motivating numerous studies to address this challenge. Inspired by the
progressive approximation principle in the Stone-Weierstrass theorem, we
propose Expandable Residual Approximation (ERA), a novel KD method that
decomposes the approximation of residual knowledge into multiple steps,
reducing the difficulty of mimicking the teacher's representation through a
divide-and-conquer approach. Specifically, ERA employs a Multi-Branched
Residual Network (MBRNet) to implement this residual knowledge decomposition.
Additionally, a Teacher Weight Integration (TWI) strategy is introduced to
mitigate the capacity disparity by reusing the teacher's head weights.
Extensive experiments show that ERA improves the Top-1 accuracy on the ImageNet
classification benchmark by 1.41% and the AP on the MS COCO object detection
benchmark by 1.40, as well as achieving leading performance across computer
vision tasks. Codes and models are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统3D扫描方法对动物重建存在侵入性、成本高、难以在自然环境中部署等问题，需要开发非侵入式的深度学习解决方案。

Conclusion: 该领域正处于快速发展阶段，需要进一步解决技术挑战，推动动物3D重建在生物学、畜牧业、数字娱乐等领域的应用。

Abstract: Reconstructing the 3D geometry, pose, and motion of animals is a
long-standing problem, which has a wide range of applications, from biology,
livestock management, and animal conservation and welfare to content creation
in digital entertainment and Virtual/Augmented Reality (VR/AR). Traditionally,
3D models of real animals are obtained using 3D scanners. These, however, are
intrusive, often prohibitively expensive, and difficult to deploy in the
natural environment of the animals. In recent years, we have seen a significant
surge in deep learning-based techniques that enable the 3D reconstruction, in a
non-intrusive manner, of the shape and motion of dynamic objects just from
their RGB image and/or video observations. Several papers have explored their
application and extension to various types of animals. This paper surveys the
latest developments in this emerging and growing field of research. It
categorizes and discusses the state-of-the-art methods based on their input
modalities, the way the 3D geometry and motion of animals are represented, the
type of reconstruction techniques they use, and the training mechanisms they
adopt. It also analyzes the performance of some key methods, discusses their
strengths and limitations, and identifies current challenges and directions for
future research.

TL;DR: 提出Voxel Diffusion Module (VDM)增强点云体素表示和扩散能力，通过稀疏3D卷积和子流形卷积提升Transformer和SSM模型的检测精度，在多个数据集上达到SOTA性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于Transformer和SSM的点云检测模型由于体素表示的串行处理限制，缺乏卷积操作的空间扩散能力，显著影响检测精度

Method: 设计VDM模块，包含稀疏3D卷积、子流形稀疏卷积和残差连接，将特征图下采样至原始分辨率的1/4，实现前景体素特征扩散和细粒度空间信息聚合

Result: VDM-SSM在Waymo达到74.7 mAPH(L2)，nuScenes达到72.9 NDS，Argoverse 2达到42.3 mAP，ONCE达到67.6 mAP，在所有数据集上创下新SOTA

Conclusion: VDM能有效增强体素级表示和空间扩散，可无缝集成到主流Transformer和SSM检测模型中，具有很好的通用性和性能提升效果

Abstract: Recent advances in point cloud object detection have increasingly adopted
Transformer-based and State Space Models (SSMs), demonstrating strong
performance. However, voxelbased representations in these models require strict
consistency in input and output dimensions due to their serialized processing,
which limits the spatial diffusion capability typically offered by
convolutional operations. This limitation significantly affects detection
accuracy. Inspired by CNN-based object detection architectures, we propose a
novel Voxel Diffusion Module (VDM) to enhance voxel-level representation and
diffusion in point cloud data. VDM is composed of sparse 3D convolutions,
submanifold sparse convolutions, and residual connections. To ensure
computational efficiency, the output feature maps are downsampled to one-fourth
of the original input resolution. VDM serves two primary functions: (1)
diffusing foreground voxel features through sparse 3D convolutions to enrich
spatial context, and (2) aggregating fine-grained spatial information to
strengthen voxelwise feature representation. The enhanced voxel features
produced by VDM can be seamlessly integrated into mainstream Transformer- or
SSM-based detection models for accurate object classification and localization,
highlighting the generalizability of our method. We evaluate VDM on several
benchmark datasets by embedding it into both Transformerbased and SSM-based
models. Experimental results show that our approach consistently improves
detection accuracy over baseline models. Specifically, VDM-SSMs achieve 74.7
mAPH (L2) on Waymo, 72.9 NDS on nuScenes, 42.3 mAP on Argoverse 2, and 67.6 mAP
on ONCE, setting new stateof-the-art performance across all datasets. Our code
will be made publicly available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的病理学基础模型在不同数据集上使用不同策略训练，导致性能不一致和泛化能力有限，需要一种统一的集成方法来提高模型的准确性和鲁棒性。

Method: ELF框架通过集成学习整合五种病理学基础模型，生成统一的切片级表征，特别适合数据有限的临床场景，如治疗反应预测。

Conclusion: 集成学习对病理学基础模型具有强大作用，ELF作为一个可扩展和可泛化的解决方案，有望推动AI辅助精准肿瘤学的发展。

Abstract: Histopathology is essential for disease diagnosis and treatment
decision-making. Recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) have enabled
the development of pathology foundation models that learn rich visual
representations from large-scale whole-slide images (WSIs). However, existing
models are often trained on disparate datasets using varying strategies,
leading to inconsistent performance and limited generalizability. Here, we
introduce ELF (Ensemble Learning of Foundation models), a novel framework that
integrates five state-of-the-art pathology foundation models to generate
unified slide-level representations. Trained on 53,699 WSIs spanning 20
anatomical sites, ELF leverages ensemble learning to capture complementary
information from diverse models while maintaining high data efficiency. Unlike
traditional tile-level models, ELF's slide-level architecture is particularly
advantageous in clinical contexts where data are limited, such as therapeutic
response prediction. We evaluated ELF across a wide range of clinical
applications, including disease classification, biomarker detection, and
response prediction to major anticancer therapies, cytotoxic chemotherapy,
targeted therapy, and immunotherapy, across multiple cancer types. ELF
consistently outperformed all constituent foundation models and existing
slide-level models, demonstrating superior accuracy and robustness. Our results
highlight the power of ensemble learning for pathology foundation models and
suggest ELF as a scalable and generalizable solution for advancing AI-assisted
precision oncology.

Conclusion: MSPG-SEN模型不仅在图像生成质量和视觉感知方面取得显著提升，还简化了训练过程、降低了训练成本。所提出的技术方案具有强大的灵活性和跨任务能力，为GAN模型的发展提供了新的方向。

Abstract: Although diffusion model has made good progress in the field of image
generation, GAN\cite{huang2023adaptive} still has a large development space due
to its unique advantages, such as WGAN\cite{liu2021comparing},
SSGAN\cite{guibas2021adaptive} \cite{zhang2022vsa} \cite{zhou2024adapt} and so

generative adversarial network (MSPG-SEN) for GAN models. This paper has four
contributions: 1) : We propose a two-flow feedback multi-scale progressive
Generative Adversarial network (MSPG-SEN), which not only improves image
quality and human visual perception on the basis of retaining the advantages of
the existing GAN model, but also simplifies the training process and reduces
the training cost of GAN networks. Our experimental results show that, MSPG-SEN
has achieved state-of-the-art generation results on the following five

is 85.5\%,POKL The dataset is 88.7\%,OPIN The dataset is 96.4\%. 2) : We
propose an adaptive perception-behavioral feedback loop (APFL), which
effectively improves the robustness and training stability of the model and
reduces the training cost. 3) : We propose a globally connected two-flow
dynamic residual network(). After ablation experiments, it can effectively
improve the training efficiency and greatly improve the generalization ability,
with stronger flexibility. 4) : We propose a new dynamic embedded attention
mechanism (DEMA). After experiments, the attention can be extended to a variety
of image processing tasks, which can effectively capture global-local
information, improve feature separation capability and feature expression
capabilities, and requires minimal computing resources only 88.7\% with INJK
With strong cross-task capability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决无监督域适应中分布偏移问题，旨在在不使用目标域标签的情况下，通过特征精炼实现跨域的鲁棒泛化。

Method: 结合三个关键组件：1）使用未标记目标数据适应批归一化统计；2）从源训练模型进行特征蒸馏；3）假设转移。通过在统计和表示层面对齐特征分布，创建鲁棒且域不变的特征空间。

Result: 在CIFAR10-C、CIFAR100-C、MNIST-C和PatchCamelyon-C等基准数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法在抗干扰鲁棒性方面优于先前方法。

Conclusion: DAFR2通过改进特征对齐、增加域间互信息和降低对输入扰动的敏感性，实现了有效的无监督域适应，无需复杂架构或训练目标。

Abstract: We propose Domain Adaptation via Feature Refinement (DAFR2), a simple yet
effective framework for unsupervised domain adaptation under distribution
shift. The proposed method synergistically combines three key components:
adaptation of Batch Normalization statistics using unlabeled target data,
feature distillation from a source-trained model and hypothesis transfer. By
aligning feature distributions at the statistical and representational levels,
DAFR2 produces robust and domain-invariant feature spaces that generalize
across similar domains without requiring target labels, complex architectures
or sophisticated training objectives. Extensive experiments on benchmark
datasets, including CIFAR10-C, CIFAR100-C, MNIST-C and PatchCamelyon-C,
demonstrate that the proposed algorithm outperforms prior methods in robustness
to corruption. Theoretical and empirical analyses further reveal that our
method achieves improved feature alignment, increased mutual information
between the domains and reduced sensitivity to input perturbations.

Abstract: Conventional computed tomography (CT) lacks the ability to capture dynamic,
weight-bearing joint motion. Functional evaluation, particularly after surgical
intervention, requires four-dimensional (4D) imaging, but current methods are
limited by excessive radiation exposure or incomplete spatial information from
2D techniques. We propose an integrated 4D joint analysis platform that
combines: (1) a dual robotic arm cone-beam CT (CBCT) system with a
programmable, gantry-free trajectory optimized for upright scanning; (2) a
hybrid imaging pipeline that fuses static 3D CBCT with dynamic 2D X-rays using
deep learning-based preprocessing, 3D-2D projection, and iterative
optimization; and (3) a clinically validated framework for quantitative
kinematic assessment. In simulation studies, the method achieved sub-voxel
accuracy (0.235 mm) with a 99.18 percent success rate, outperforming
conventional and state-of-the-art registration approaches. Clinical evaluation
further demonstrated accurate quantification of tibial plateau motion and
medial-lateral variance in post-total knee arthroplasty (TKA) patients. This 4D
CBCT platform enables fast, accurate, and low-dose dynamic joint imaging,
offering new opportunities for biomechanical research, precision diagnostics,

Conclusion: 提出的超图网络能有效融合不同类型特征，为智能计算机辅助诊断系统提供了更好的解决方案

Abstract: Automatic detection of abnormal cervical cells from Thinprep Cytologic Test
(TCT) images is a critical component in the development of intelligent
computer-aided diagnostic systems. However, existing algorithms typically fail
to effectively model the correlations of visual features, while these spatial
correlation features actually contain critical diagnostic information.
Furthermore, no detection algorithm has the ability to integrate
inter-correlation features of cells with intra-discriminative features of
cells, lacking a fusion strategy for the end-to-end detection model. In this
work, we propose a hypergraph-based cell detection network that effectively
fuses different types of features, combining spatial correlation features and
deep discriminative features. Specifically, we use a Multi-level Fusion
Sub-network (MLF-SNet) to enhance feature extractioncapabilities. Then we
introduce a Cross-level Feature Fusion Strategy with Hypergraph Computation
module (CLFFS-HC), to integrate mixed features. Finally, we conducted
experiments on three publicly available datasets, and the results demonstrate
that our method significantly improves the performance of cervical abnormal
cell detection.

Abstract: Pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have recently shown promise in
detecting anomalies. However, previous approaches are fundamentally limited by
their reliance on human-designed prompts and the lack of accessible anomaly
samples, leading to significant gaps in context-specific anomaly understanding.
In this paper, we propose \textbf{A}daptive \textbf{P}rompt \textbf{T}uning
with semantic alignment for anomaly detection (APT), a groundbreaking prior
knowledge-free, few-shot framework and overcomes the limitations of traditional
prompt-based approaches. APT uses self-generated anomaly samples with noise
perturbations to train learnable prompts that capture context-dependent
anomalies in different scenarios. To prevent overfitting to synthetic noise, we
propose a Self-Optimizing Meta-prompt Guiding Scheme (SMGS) that iteratively
aligns the prompts with general anomaly semantics while incorporating diverse
synthetic anomaly. Our system not only advances pixel-wise anomaly detection,
but also achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmark datasets
without requiring prior knowledge for prompt crafting, establishing a robust
and versatile solution for real-world anomaly detection.

Conclusion: RAGSR方法通过明确的区域信息提取和注意力机制，有效提升了多对象场景下的超分辨率质量，为传统SISR技术提供了更好的解决方案

Abstract: The rich textual information of large vision-language models (VLMs) combined
with the powerful generative prior of pre-trained text-to-image (T2I) diffusion
models has achieved impressive performance in single-image super-resolution
(SISR). However, existing methods still face significant challenges in
generating clear and accurate regional details, particularly in scenarios
involving multiple objects. This challenge primarily stems from a lack of
fine-grained regional descriptions and the models' insufficient ability to
capture complex prompts. To address these limitations, we propose a Regional
Attention Guided Super-Resolution (RAGSR) method that explicitly extracts
localized fine-grained information and effectively encodes it through a novel
regional attention mechanism, enabling both enhanced detail and overall
visually coherent SR results. Specifically, RAGSR localizes object regions in
an image and assigns fine-grained caption to each region, which are formatted
as region-text pairs as textual priors for T2I models. A regional guided
attention is then leveraged to ensure that each region-text pair is properly
considered in the attention process while preventing unwanted interactions
between unrelated region-text pairs. By leveraging this attention mechanism,
our approach offers finer control over the integration of text and image
information, thereby effectively overcoming limitations faced by traditional
SISR techniques. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that
our approach exhibits superior performance in generating perceptually authentic
visual details while maintaining contextual consistency compared to existing
approaches.

Conclusion: TLG通过异构网络设计有效解决了元学习中的同质化问题，在弱监督少样本语义分割任务中取得了突破性性能，证明了异构方法的有效性。

Abstract: Meta-learning aims to uniformly sample homogeneous support-query pairs,
characterized by the same categories and similar attributes, and extract useful
inductive biases through identical network architectures. However, this
identical network design results in over-semantic homogenization. To address
this, we propose a novel homologous but heterogeneous network. By treating
support-query pairs as dual perspectives, we introduce heterogeneous visual
aggregation (HA) modules to enhance complementarity while preserving semantic
commonality. To further reduce semantic noise and amplify the uniqueness of
heterogeneous semantics, we design a heterogeneous transfer (HT) module.
Finally, we propose heterogeneous CLIP (HC) textual information to enhance the
generalization capability of multimodal models. In the weakly-supervised

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FTIO是一个后处理框架，通过频繁时间整合对象来提升无监督视频对象分割性能，包含对象选择标准和时序一致性修正方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决无监督视频对象分割中初始分割不确定性、小对象/复杂结构对象识别困难以及变形和快速运动导致的时序不一致性问题

Method: 提出两个关键组件：1) 组合标准改进对象选择，提取频繁出现的显著对象；2) 三阶段方法整合缺失对象掩码区域以修正时序不一致性

Result: 实验结果表明FTIO在多对象无监督视频对象分割中达到了最先进的性能

Conclusion: FTIO框架有效解决了无监督视频对象分割中的关键挑战，通过频繁时间整合显著提升了分割质量和时序一致性

Abstract: Predicting and tracking objects in real-world scenarios is a critical
challenge in Video Object Segmentation (VOS) tasks. Unsupervised VOS (UVOS) has
the additional challenge of finding an initial segmentation of salient objects,
which affects the entire process and keeps a permanent uncertainty about the
object proposals. Moreover, deformation and fast motion can lead to temporal
inconsistencies. To address these problems, we propose Frequent Temporally
Integrated Objects (FTIO), a post-processing framework with two key components.
First, we introduce a combined criterion to improve object selection,
mitigating failures common in UVOS--particularly when objects are small or
structurally complex--by extracting frequently appearing salient objects.
Second, we present a three-stage method to correct temporal inconsistencies by
integrating missing object mask regions. Experimental results demonstrate that
FTIO achieves state-of-the-art performance in multi-object UVOS. Code is

TL;DR: SpecVLM是一个针对视频大语言模型的训练无关推测解码框架，通过两阶段视频token剪枝实现无损加速，最高可达2.68倍解码速度提升


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频大语言模型依赖密集视频token表示，导致内存和计算开销巨大，而现有的视频token缩减方法存在信息丢失问题，需要一种既能加速解码又能保持准确性的解决方案

Method: 采用两阶段视频token剪枝：第一阶段基于验证器注意力信号选择高信息量token，第二阶段以空间均匀方式剪枝冗余token，利用发现的新现象——草稿模型的推测对视频token剪枝不敏感

Result: 在四个视频理解基准测试中验证有效性，LLaVA-OneVision-72B达到2.68倍解码加速，Qwen2.5-VL-32B达到2.11倍加速

Conclusion: SpecVLM通过创新的两阶段token剪枝和推测解码框架，成功实现了视频大语言模型的无损加速解码，为解决视频处理中的计算效率问题提供了有效方案

Abstract: Video large language models (Vid-LLMs) have shown strong capabilities in
understanding video content. However, their reliance on dense video token
representations introduces substantial memory and computational overhead in
both prefilling and decoding. To mitigate the information loss of recent video
token reduction methods and accelerate the decoding stage of Vid-LLMs
losslessly, we introduce SpecVLM, a training-free speculative decoding (SD)
framework tailored for Vid-LLMs that incorporates staged video token pruning.
Building on our novel finding that the draft model's speculation exhibits low
sensitivity to video token pruning, SpecVLM prunes up to 90% of video tokens,
enabling efficient speculation without sacrificing accuracy. To achieve this,
it performs a two-stage pruning process: Stage I selects highly informative
tokens guided by attention signals from the verifier (target model), while
Stage II prunes remaining redundant ones in a spatially uniform manner.
Extensive experiments on four video understanding benchmarks demonstrate the
effectiveness and robustness of SpecVLM, which achieves up to 2.68$\times$
decoding speedup for LLaVA-OneVision-72B and 2.11$\times$ speedup for
Qwen2.5-VL-32B.

*Thinesh Thiyakesan Ponbagavathi,Kunyu Peng,Alina Roitberg*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出T-Mask方法，通过时间token掩码和动态区域强调来改进基础模型在驾驶员监控中的跨视角泛化能力，在Drive&Act数据集上取得了显著性能提升


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 相机视角变化是驾驶员监控中的常见障碍，虽然深度学习和预训练基础模型通过轻量级适配显示出强大的泛化潜力，但其对未见视角的鲁棒性仍未得到充分探索

Method: 提出了T-Mask方法，这是一种新的图像到视频探测方法，利用时间token掩码并强调更多动态视频区域。同时比较了线性探测、高级探测策略以及两种基础模型（DINOv2和CLIP）与参数高效微调（PEFT）和全微调的对比

Result: T-Mask在跨视角top-1准确率上比强探测基线提高+1.23%，比PEFT方法提高+8.0%，且不增加任何参数。对于代表性不足的次要活动，在训练视角下识别率提高+5.42%，在跨视角设置下提高+1.36%

Conclusion: 这项工作提供了令人鼓舞的证据，表明使用像T-Mask这样的轻量级探测方法适配基础模型在细粒度驾驶员观察方面具有强大潜力，特别是在跨视角和低数据设置中。这些结果凸显了在利用基础模型构建鲁棒驾驶员监控系统时时间token选择的重要性

Abstract: Changes of camera perspective are a common obstacle in driver monitoring.
While deep learning and pretrained foundation models show strong potential for
improved generalization via lightweight adaptation of the final layers
('probing'), their robustness to unseen viewpoints remains underexplored. We
study this challenge by adapting image foundation models to driver monitoring
using a single training view, and evaluating them directly on unseen
perspectives without further adaptation. We benchmark simple linear probes,
advanced probing strategies, and compare two foundation models (DINOv2 and
CLIP) against parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) and full fine-tuning.
Building on these insights, we introduce \textsc{T-Mask} -- a new
image-to-video probing method that leverages temporal token masking and
emphasizes more dynamic video regions. Benchmarked on the public Drive\&Act
dataset, \textsc{T-Mask} improves cross-view top-1 accuracy by $+1.23\%$ over
strong probing baselines and $+8.0\%$ over PEFT methods, without adding any
parameters. It proves particularly effective for underrepresented secondary
activities, boosting recognition by $+5.42\%$ under the trained view and
$+1.36\%$ under cross-view settings. This work provides encouraging evidence
that adapting foundation models with lightweight probing methods like
\textsc{T-Mask} has strong potential in fine-grained driver observation,
especially in cross-view and low-data settings. These results highlight the
importance of temporal token selection when leveraging foundation models to
build robust driver monitoring systems. Code and models will be made available
at https://github.com/th-nesh/T-MASK to support ongoing research.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FoCa方法通过将特征缓存视为特征ODE求解问题，在保持生成质量的同时实现了显著加速，在多个任务上达到5.50-6.45倍的近无损加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的特征缓存方法在高加速比下难以保持生成质量，预测误差会因长步预测的不稳定性而急剧增加。

Method: 采用ODE视角建模隐藏特征序列，将特征缓存视为特征ODE求解问题，提出Forecast-then-Calibrate (FoCa)方法，通过稳健地整合历史特征来解决大跳跃间隔下的退化问题。

Result: 在图像合成、视频生成和超分辨率任务上，FoCa实现了显著加速：FLUX加速5.50倍、HunyuanVideo加速6.45倍、Inf-DiT加速3.17倍、DiT加速4.53倍，同时保持高质量。

Conclusion: FoCa方法有效解决了现有缓存策略在高加速比下的质量退化问题，无需额外训练即可实现近无损的推理加速。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have demonstrated exceptional performance in
high-fidelity image and video generation. To reduce their substantial
computational costs, feature caching techniques have been proposed to
accelerate inference by reusing hidden representations from previous timesteps.
However, current methods often struggle to maintain generation quality at high
acceleration ratios, where prediction errors increase sharply due to the
inherent instability of long-step forecasting. In this work, we adopt an
ordinary differential equation (ODE) perspective on the hidden-feature
sequence, modeling layer representations along the trajectory as a feature-ODE.
We attribute the degradation of existing caching strategies to their inability
to robustly integrate historical features under large skipping intervals. To
address this, we propose FoCa (Forecast-then-Calibrate), which treats feature
caching as a feature-ODE solving problem. Extensive experiments on image
synthesis, video generation, and super-resolution tasks demonstrate the
effectiveness of FoCa, especially under aggressive acceleration. Without
additional training, FoCa achieves near-lossless speedups of 5.50 times on
FLUX, 6.45 times on HunyuanVideo, 3.17 times on Inf-DiT, and maintains high
quality with a 4.53 times speedup on DiT.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: OmniCache是一种无需训练的训练加速方法，通过利用去噪过程中的全局冗余性，在扩散Transformer中实现高效缓存重用，显著加速采样过程同时保持生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散Transformer虽然性能强大，但由于采样步骤多、每步计算复杂，计算成本高昂，难以实现实时部署。现有缓存方法基于步骤间相似性，倾向于重用后期采样步骤，效果有限。

Method: 从DIT模型的采样视角出发，系统分析模型采样轨迹，在整个采样过程中策略性地分布缓存重用。在缓存重用期间动态估计相应噪声并过滤，减少对采样方向的影响。

Result: 大量实验表明，该方法在保持竞争力的生成质量的同时，显著加速了采样过程。

Conclusion: OmniCache为基于扩散的生成模型的高效部署提供了一个有前景且实用的解决方案，通过全局视角更有效地利用缓存计算。

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as a powerful paradigm for generative tasks
such as image synthesis and video generation, with Transformer architectures
further enhancing performance. However, the high computational cost of
diffusion Transformers-stemming from a large number of sampling steps and
complex per-step computations-presents significant challenges for real-time
deployment. In this paper, we introduce OmniCache, a training-free acceleration
method that exploits the global redundancy inherent in the denoising process.
Unlike existing methods that determine caching strategies based on inter-step
similarities and tend to prioritize reusing later sampling steps, our approach
originates from the sampling perspective of DIT models. We systematically
analyze the model's sampling trajectories and strategically distribute cache
reuse across the entire sampling process. This global perspective enables more
effective utilization of cached computations throughout the diffusion
trajectory, rather than concentrating reuse within limited segments of the
sampling procedure.In addition, during cache reuse, we dynamically estimate the
corresponding noise and filter it out to reduce its impact on the sampling
direction.Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach accelerates the
sampling process while maintaining competitive generative quality, offering a
promising and practical solution for efficient deployment of diffusion-based
generative models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MedOmni-45 Degrees是一个专门评估医疗大语言模型推理可靠性的基准测试，通过45度图可视化安全性与性能的权衡关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型在医疗决策支持中的广泛应用，需要评估其推理的可靠性，特别是思维链忠实性和迎合性风险，现有基准往往将这些漏洞简化为单一准确率分数。

Method: 构建包含1,804个医疗问题的基准，涵盖6个专业领域和3种任务类型，每个问题配以7种操纵性提示和无提示基线，共产生约27K输入。评估7个LLM，使用准确性、思维链忠实性和反迎合性三个指标组合成复合分数。

Result: 结果显示所有模型都存在安全性与性能的权衡，没有模型能超越对角线。开源模型QwQ-32B表现最接近对角线(43.81度)，在安全性和准确性之间取得平衡但都不是最优。

Conclusion: MedOmni-45 Degrees为暴露医疗LLM的推理漏洞提供了专门的基准测试工具，可指导更安全的模型开发。

Abstract: With the increasing use of large language models (LLMs) in medical
decision-support, it is essential to evaluate not only their final answers but
also the reliability of their reasoning. Two key risks are Chain-of-Thought
(CoT) faithfulness -- whether reasoning aligns with responses and medical facts
-- and sycophancy, where models follow misleading cues over correctness.
Existing benchmarks often collapse such vulnerabilities into single accuracy
scores. To address this, we introduce MedOmni-45 Degrees, a benchmark and
workflow designed to quantify safety-performance trade-offs under manipulative
hint conditions. It contains 1,804 reasoning-focused medical questions across
six specialties and three task types, including 500 from MedMCQA. Each question
is paired with seven manipulative hint types and a no-hint baseline, producing
about 27K inputs. We evaluate seven LLMs spanning open- vs. closed-source,
general-purpose vs. medical, and base vs. reasoning-enhanced models, totaling
over 189K inferences. Three metrics -- Accuracy, CoT-Faithfulness, and
Anti-Sycophancy -- are combined into a composite score visualized with a 45
Degrees plot. Results show a consistent safety-performance trade-off, with no
model surpassing the diagonal. The open-source QwQ-32B performs closest (43.81
Degrees), balancing safety and accuracy but not leading in both. MedOmni-45
Degrees thus provides a focused benchmark for exposing reasoning
vulnerabilities in medical LLMs and guiding safer model development.

TL;DR: PromptFlare是一种新型对抗保护方法，通过利用跨注意力机制和提示嵌入的内在特性，保护图像免受基于扩散修复模型的恶意修改。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型的成功使得高质量图像修改变得容易，但同时也带来了恶意滥用的风险。现有方法主要依赖图像级不一致性，难以有效处理文本提示的影响。

Result: 在EditBench数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法在各种指标上达到最先进性能，同时显著降低计算开销和GPU内存使用。

Conclusion: PromptFlare是一种鲁棒且高效的防护方法，能够有效防止未经授权的图像操作。

Abstract: The success of diffusion models has enabled effortless, high-quality image
modifications that precisely align with users' intentions, thereby raising
concerns about their potential misuse by malicious actors. Previous studies
have attempted to mitigate such misuse through adversarial attacks. However,
these approaches heavily rely on image-level inconsistencies, which pose
fundamental limitations in addressing the influence of textual prompts. In this
paper, we propose PromptFlare, a novel adversarial protection method designed
to protect images from malicious modifications facilitated by diffusion-based
inpainting models. Our approach leverages the cross-attention mechanism to
exploit the intrinsic properties of prompt embeddings. Specifically, we
identify and target shared token of prompts that is invariant and semantically
uninformative, injecting adversarial noise to suppress the sampling process.
The injected noise acts as a cross-attention decoy, diverting the model's focus
away from meaningful prompt-image alignments and thereby neutralizing the
effect of prompt. Extensive experiments on the EditBench dataset demonstrate
that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance across various metrics
while significantly reducing computational overhead and GPU memory usage. These
findings highlight PromptFlare as a robust and efficient protection against
unauthorized image manipulations. The code is available at

Abstract: Visual Foundation Models (VFMs) are becoming ubiquitous in computer vision,
powering systems for diverse tasks such as object detection, image
classification, segmentation, pose estimation, and motion tracking. VFMs are
capitalizing on seminal innovations in deep learning models, such as LeNet-5,
AlexNet, ResNet, VGGNet, InceptionNet, DenseNet, YOLO, and ViT, to deliver
superior performance across a range of critical computer vision applications.
These include security-sensitive domains like biometric verification,
autonomous vehicle perception, and medical image analysis, where robustness is
essential to fostering trust between technology and the end-users. This article
investigates network robustness requirements crucial in computer vision systems
to adapt effectively to dynamic environments influenced by factors such as
lighting, weather conditions, and sensor characteristics. We examine the
prevalent empirical defenses and robust training employed to enhance vision
network robustness against real-world challenges such as distributional shifts,
noisy and spatially distorted inputs, and adversarial attacks. Subsequently, we
provide a comprehensive analysis of the challenges associated with these
defense mechanisms, including network properties and components to guide
ablation studies and benchmarking metrics to evaluate network robustness.

Conclusion: FlexMUSE通过创新的模态对齐和融合技术，成功解决了多模态创意写作中的语义一致性问题，为这一新兴领域提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-modal creative writing (MMCW) aims to produce illustrated articles.
Unlike common multi-modal generative (MMG) tasks such as storytelling or
caption generation, MMCW is an entirely new and more abstract challenge where
textual and visual contexts are not strictly related to each other. Existing
methods for related tasks can be forcibly migrated to this track, but they
require specific modality inputs or costly training, and often suffer from
semantic inconsistencies between modalities. Therefore, the main challenge lies
in economically performing MMCW with flexible interactive patterns, where the
semantics between the modalities of the output are more aligned. In this work,
we propose FlexMUSE with a T2I module to enable optional visual input. FlexMUSE
promotes creativity and emphasizes the unification between modalities by
proposing the modality semantic alignment gating (msaGate) to restrict the
textual input. Besides, an attention-based cross-modality fusion is proposed to
augment the input features for semantic enhancement. The modality semantic
creative direct preference optimization (mscDPO) within FlexMUSE is designed by
extending the rejected samples to facilitate the writing creativity. Moreover,
to advance the MMCW, we expose a dataset called ArtMUSE which contains with
around 3k calibrated text-image pairs. FlexMUSE achieves promising results,
demonstrating its consistency, creativity and coherence.

Abstract: Quantitative microstructural characterization is fundamental to materials
science, where electron micrograph (EM) provides indispensable high-resolution
insights. However, progress in deep learning-based EM characterization has been
hampered by the scarcity of large-scale, diverse, and expert-annotated
datasets, due to acquisition costs, privacy concerns, and annotation
complexity. To address this issue, we introduce UniEM-3M, the first large-scale
and multimodal EM dataset for instance-level understanding. It comprises 5,091
high-resolution EMs, about 3 million instance segmentation labels, and
image-level attribute-disentangled textual descriptions, a subset of which will
be made publicly available. Furthermore, we are also releasing a text-to-image

data augmentation tool and a proxy for the complete data distribution. To
establish a rigorous benchmark, we evaluate various representative instance
segmentation methods on the complete UniEM-3M and present UniEM-Net as a strong
baseline model. Quantitative experiments demonstrate that this flow-based model
outperforms other advanced methods on this challenging benchmark. Our
multifaceted release of a partial dataset, a generative model, and a

Result: 通过大量实验证明IAML训练方法优于传统训练范式

Conclusion: IAML训练范式能有效提升MLLM在GUI元素坐标生成任务中的性能表现

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have emerged as pivotal tools in
enhancing human-computer interaction. In this paper we focus on the application
of MLLMs in the field of graphical user interface (GUI) elements structuring,
where they assist in processing user instructions based on screen contents.
Despite the promise of MLLMs, their performance in precisely generating UI
element coordinates, a critical aspect of GUI understanding, is hindered by the
nature of next-token prediction training. This challenge arises from the
semantic void surrounding numerical UI coordinates in language representation
spaces, necessitating a substantial and diverse dataset to bolster visual
module capabilities. To address these limitations, we introduce an
IoU-Augmented Maximum Likelihood (IAML) training paradigm. Specifically, our
approach involves a novel pipeline for IoU-based coordinate sampling to augment
the training data, which considers the proximity to ground truth coordinates.
This data augmentation strategy is then employed to fine-tune MLLMs under the
IAML paradigm, which is designed to mitigate the exposure bias problem inherent
in traditional maximum likelihood estimation. Through extensive experiments, we
demonstrate the superior performance of our IAML training approach over
traditional training paradigms.

Abstract: With the enhancement of remote sensing image resolution and the rapid
advancement of deep learning, land cover mapping is transitioning from
pixel-level segmentation to object-based vector modeling. This shift demands
more from deep learning models, requiring precise object boundaries and
topological consistency. However, existing datasets face three main challenges:
limited class annotations, small data scale, and lack of spatial structural
information. To overcome these issues, we introduce IRSAMap, the first global
remote sensing dataset for large-scale, high-resolution, multi-feature land
cover vector mapping. IRSAMap offers four key advantages: 1) a comprehensive
vector annotation system with over 1.8 million instances of 10 typical objects
(e.g., buildings, roads, rivers), ensuring semantic and spatial accuracy; 2) an
intelligent annotation workflow combining manual and AI-based methods to
improve efficiency and consistency; 3) global coverage across 79 regions in six
continents, totaling over 1,000 km; and 4) multi-task adaptability for tasks
like pixel-level classification, building outline extraction, road centerline
extraction, and panoramic segmentation. IRSAMap provides a standardized
benchmark for the shift from pixel-based to object-based approaches, advancing
geographic feature automation and collaborative modeling. It is valuable for
global geographic information updates and digital twin construction. The

heightened sensitivity. A key achievement is the ability to detect small plumes
down to 400 m2 (i.e., for a single pixel at 20 m resolution), surpassing
traditional methods limited to larger plumes. Experiments show our approach
achieves a 78.39% F1-score on the validation set, demonstrating superior
performance in sensitivity and precision over existing remote sensing
techniques for automated methane monitoring, especially for small plumes.

*Fengshun Wang,Qiurui Wang,Peilin Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出双流Mamba金字塔网络，分别处理花样滑冰的技术分(TES)和节目内容分(PCS)评估，解决了现有方法在特征分离、动作元素评分和长视频处理方面的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有花样滑冰评分方法存在三个主要问题：1)视频和音频特征未按评分标准区分使用；2)未对每个动作元素单独评分；3)长视频上下文处理效率低。

Method: 采用双流架构：视觉特征流用于TES评估，音视频融合流用于PCS评估。使用多级融合机制和多尺度Mamba金字塔处理不同时间尺度的动作元素，利用Mamba的线性计算复杂度处理长视频。

Result: 在FineFS基准测试中达到了最先进的性能表现。

Conclusion: 该方法与裁判评分标准对齐，能有效分离特征、评估单个动作元素，并高效处理长视频，为花样滑冰动作质量评估提供了创新解决方案。

Abstract: Technical Element Score (TES) and Program Component Score (PCS) evaluations
in figure skating demand precise assessment of athletic actions and artistic
interpretation, respectively. Existing methods face three major challenges.
Firstly, video and audio cues are regarded as common features for both TES and
PCS predictions in previous works without considering the prior evaluation
criterion of figure skating. Secondly, action elements in competitions are
separated in time, TES should be derived from each element's score, but
existing methods try to give an overall TES prediction without evaluating each
action element. Thirdly, lengthy competition videos make it difficult and
inefficient to handle long-range contexts. To address these challenges, we
propose a two-stream Mamba pyramid network that aligns with actual judging
criteria to predict TES and PCS by separating visual-feature based TES
evaluation stream from audio-visual-feature based PCS evaluation stream. In the
PCS evaluation stream, we introduce a multi-level fusion mechanism to guarantee
that video-based features remain unaffected when assessing TES, and enhance PCS
estimation by fusing visual and auditory cues across each contextual level of
the pyramid. In the TES evaluation stream, the multi-scale Mamba pyramid and
TES head we proposed effectively address the challenges of localizing and
evaluating action elements with various temporal scales and give score
predictions. With Mamba's superior ability to capture long-range dependencies
and its linear computational complexity, our method is ideal for handling
lengthy figure skating videos. Comprehensive experimentation demonstrates that
our framework attains state-of-the-art performance on the FineFS benchmark. Our
source code is available at

Abstract: The digitization of handwritten marksheets presents huge challenges due to
the different styles of handwriting and complex table structures in such
documents like marksheets. This work introduces a hybrid method that integrates
OpenCV for table detection and PaddleOCR for recognizing sequential handwritten
text. The image processing capabilities of OpenCV efficiently detects rows and
columns which enable computationally lightweight and accurate table detection.
Additionally, YOLOv8 and Modified YOLOv8 are implemented for handwritten text
recognition within the detected table structures alongside PaddleOCR which
further enhance the system's versatility. The proposed model achieves high
accuracy on our custom dataset which is designed to represent different and
diverse handwriting styles and complex table layouts. Experimental results
demonstrate that YOLOv8 Modified achieves an accuracy of 92.72 percent,
outperforming PaddleOCR 91.37 percent and the YOLOv8 model 88.91 percent. This
efficiency reduces the necessity for manual work which makes this a practical
and fast solution for digitizing academic as well as administrative documents.
This research serves the field of document automation, particularly handwritten
document understanding, by providing operational and reliable methods to scale,
enhance, and integrate the technologies involved.

TL;DR: 提出MM-ORIENT框架，通过跨模态关系图和分层注意力机制解决多模态学习中的噪声问题和信息损失问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态学习中单个模态存在噪声，显式交互会影响多模态表示质量，且传统融合方法可能忽略单个模态的判别性信息

Method: 使用跨模态关系图在不显式交互的情况下重构单模态特征获取多模态表示，并提出分层交互单模态注意力机制(HIMA)来关注模态内重要信息

Result: 在三个数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法能有效理解多模态内容并适用于多任务

Conclusion: MM-ORIENT框架通过避免显式模态交互和引入分层注意力，有效减少了噪声影响并保留了各模态的判别信息，在多任务多模态学习中表现优异

Abstract: A major challenge in multimodal learning is the presence of noise within
individual modalities. This noise inherently affects the resulting multimodal
representations, especially when these representations are obtained through
explicit interactions between different modalities. Moreover, the multimodal
fusion techniques while aiming to achieve a strong joint representation, can
neglect valuable discriminative information within the individual modalities.
To this end, we propose a Multimodal-Multitask framework with crOss-modal
Relation and hIErarchical iNteractive aTtention (MM-ORIENT) that is effective
for multiple tasks. The proposed approach acquires multimodal representations
cross-modally without explicit interaction between different modalities,
reducing the noise effect at the latent stage. To achieve this, we propose
cross-modal relation graphs that reconstruct monomodal features to acquire
multimodal representations. The features are reconstructed based on the node
neighborhood, where the neighborhood is decided by the features of a different
modality. We also propose Hierarchical Interactive Monomadal Attention (HIMA)
to focus on pertinent information within a modality. While cross-modal relation
graphs help comprehend high-order relationships between two modalities, HIMA
helps in multitasking by learning discriminative features of individual
modalities before late-fusing them. Finally, extensive experimental evaluation
on three datasets demonstrates that the proposed approach effectively
comprehends multimodal content for multiple tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer模型的多头自注意力机制计算复杂度和内存需求高，阻碍其在边缘设备部署。分析发现低熵注意力头贡献信息较少，存在压缩空间

Method: 使用香农熵量化每个注意力头的信息量，冻结低熵注意力图的权重并将其值量化为低精度，避免冗余重新计算

Result: 在ImageNet-1k数据集上，DeiT和Swin Transformer模型在注意力图稀疏度≤20%时达到相似或更高准确率，在更高稀疏度下保持竞争力

Conclusion: 基于信息熵的注意力图压缩策略能有效减少计算冗余，为Transformer模型在边缘设备的高效部署提供可行方案

Abstract: Transformer models rely on Multi-Head Self-Attention (MHSA) mechanisms, where
each attention head contributes to the final representation. However, their
computational complexity and high memory demands due to MHSA hinders their
deployment at the edge. In this work, we analyze and exploit information
redundancy in attention maps to accelerate model inference. By quantifying the
information captured by each attention head using Shannon entropy, our analysis
reveals that attention heads with lower entropy, i.e., exhibiting more
deterministic behavior, tend to contribute less information, motivating
targeted compression strategies. Relying on these insights, we propose Entropy
Attention Maps (EAM), a model that freezes the weights of low-entropy attention
maps and quantizes these values to low precision to avoid redundant
re-computation. Empirical validation on ImageNet-1k shows that EAM achieves
similar or higher accuracy at $\leq$20\% sparsity in attention maps and
competitive performance beyond this level for the DeiT and Swin Transformer
models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受生物视觉效率行为的启发，现代视觉编码器在处理大量视觉数据时缺乏效率。生物系统能够根据任务智能地分配有限的计算资源，而当前的视觉编码器计算复杂度仅依赖图像大小。

Method: 提出了一种证明概念的解决方案，虽然分类任务不能完全代表论文目标，但通过图像分类案例展示了该方法的可行性。

Result: 证明概念解决方案在图像分类任务上显示出可行性和潜力，为建立任务驱动的动态视觉编码器提供了初步支撑。

Conclusion: 下一代视觉编码器应该采用动态计算方案，计算复杂度依据任务需求而非图像大小，这种受生物启发的方向有着广阔的应用前景。

Abstract: This position paper argues that the next generation of vision encoders should
be image size agnostic and task driven. The source of our inspiration is
biological. Not a structural aspect of biological vision, but a behavioral
trait -- efficiency. We focus on a couple of ways in which vision in nature is
efficient, but modern vision encoders not. We -- humans and animals -- deal
with vast quantities of visual data, and need to be smart where we focus our
limited energy -- it depends on the task. It is our belief that vision encoders
should be dynamic and the computational complexity should depend on the task at
hand rather than the size of the image. We, also, provide concrete first steps
towards our vision -- a proof-of-concept solution for image classification.
Despite classification being not very representative for what we are trying to
achieve, it shows that our approach is feasible and promising.

TL;DR: 本文揭示了随机时间规整(RTW)本质上是一种自注意力机制，与Transformer中的自注意力在运动识别中功能相似，但RTW具有全局视野优势，在Something-Something V2数据集上性能提升5%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索RTW和Transformer自注意力机制之间的内在联系，理解两者在序列模式处理中的相似性和差异性，以提升运动识别任务的性能。

Method: 将RTW解释为一种自注意力机制，分析其贡献权重与自注意力权重的相似性，比较两者在全局和局部视野上的差异。

Result: RTW和自注意力权重模式高度相似，平均相关性达到0.80；RTW凭借全局视野优势，在Something-Something V2数据集上比Transformer性能提升5%。

Conclusion: RTW可被视为一种特殊形式的自注意力机制，其全局处理能力相比Transformer的局部注意力具有性能优势，为运动识别提供了新的技术视角。

Abstract: This paper reveals that we can interpret the fundamental function of
Randomized Time Warping (RTW) as a type of self-attention mechanism, a core
technology of Transformers in motion recognition. The self-attention is a
mechanism that enables models to identify and weigh the importance of different
parts of an input sequential pattern. On the other hand, RTW is a general
extension of Dynamic Time Warping (DTW), a technique commonly used for matching
and comparing sequential patterns. In essence, RTW searches for optimal
contribution weights for each element of the input sequential patterns to
produce discriminative features. Although the two approaches look different,
these contribution weights can be interpreted as self-attention weights. In
fact, the two weight patterns look similar, producing a high average
correlation of 0.80 across the ten smallest canonical angles. However, they
work in different ways: RTW attention operates on an entire input sequential
pattern, while self-attention focuses on only a local view which is a subset of
the input sequential pattern because of the computational costs of the
self-attention matrix. This targeting difference leads to an advantage of RTW
against Transformer, as demonstrated by the 5\% performance improvement on the
Something-Something V2 dataset.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习方法在钢铁制造表面缺陷检测中计算复杂度过高、推理速度慢，难以在资源受限的工业环境中部署。多分支架构存在计算开销大和跨尺度特征交互不足的问题。

Method: 提出GMBINet框架，采用分组多尺度双向交互(GMBI)模块：1)分组策略进行多尺度特征提取，确保尺度无关的计算复杂度；2)双向渐进特征交互器(BPFI)和无参数元素乘加(EWMS)操作增强跨尺度交互。

Conclusion: GMBINet在保持高精度的同时实现了实时检测速度，具有很强的泛化能力，适用于工业视觉应用，超越了表面缺陷检测的范畴。

Abstract: Real-time surface defect detection is critical for maintaining product
quality and production efficiency in the steel manufacturing industry. Despite
promising accuracy, existing deep learning methods often suffer from high
computational complexity and slow inference speeds, which limit their
deployment in resource-constrained industrial environments. Recent lightweight
approaches adopt multibranch architectures based on depthwise separable
convolution (DSConv) to capture multiscale contextual information. However,
these methods often suffer from increased computational overhead and lack
effective cross-scale feature interaction, limiting their ability to fully
leverage multiscale representations. To address these challenges, we propose
GMBINet, a lightweight framework that enhances multiscale feature extraction
and interaction through novel Group Multiscale Bidirectional Interactive (GMBI)
modules. The GMBI adopts a group-wise strategy for multiscale feature
extraction, ensuring scale-agnostic computational complexity. It further
integrates a Bidirectional Progressive Feature Interactor (BPFI) and a
parameter-free Element-Wise Multiplication-Summation (EWMS) operation to
enhance cross-scale interaction without introducing additional computational
overhead. Experiments on SD-Saliency-900 and NRSD-MN datasets demonstrate that
GMBINet delivers competitive accuracy with real-time speeds of 1048 FPS on GPU
and 16.53 FPS on CPU at 512 resolution, using only 0.19 M parameters.
Additional evaluations on the NEU-CLS defect classification dataset further
confirm the strong generalization ability of our method, demonstrating its
potential for broader industrial vision applications beyond surface defect
detection. The dataset and code are publicly available at:

Abstract: Multimodal sensor fusion is an essential capability for autonomous robots,
enabling object detection and decision-making in the presence of failing or
uncertain inputs. While recent fusion methods excel in normal environmental
conditions, these approaches fail in adverse weather, e.g., heavy fog, snow, or
obstructions due to soiling. We introduce a novel multi-sensor fusion approach
tailored to adverse weather conditions. In addition to fusing RGB and LiDAR
sensors, which are employed in recent autonomous driving literature, our sensor
fusion stack is also capable of learning from NIR gated camera and radar
modalities to tackle low light and inclement weather. We fuse multimodal sensor
data through attentive, depth-based blending schemes, with learned refinement
on the Bird's Eye View (BEV) plane to combine image and range features
effectively. Our detections are predicted by a transformer decoder that weighs
modalities based on distance and visibility. We demonstrate that our method
improves the reliability of multimodal sensor fusion in autonomous vehicles
under challenging weather conditions, bridging the gap between ideal conditions
and real-world edge cases. Our approach improves average precision by 17.2 AP
compared to the next best method for vulnerable pedestrians in long distances

Motivation: 现有方法如DUSt3R和MASt3R主要针对静态户外场景，难以处理以人为中心的场景。需要开发能够同时重建人体和场景几何的方法。

Method: 利用DUNE图像编码器（融合MASt3R和multi-HMR编码器），添加人体分割、DensePose密集对应和深度估计网络头，生成包含人体语义信息的密集3D点云图。

Conclusion: HAMSt3R填补了人体与场景理解之间的空白，提供了一种高效的前馈式解决方案，适用于实际应用场景。

Abstract: Recovering the 3D geometry of a scene from a sparse set of uncalibrated
images is a long-standing problem in computer vision. While recent
learning-based approaches such as DUSt3R and MASt3R have demonstrated
impressive results by directly predicting dense scene geometry, they are
primarily trained on outdoor scenes with static environments and struggle to
handle human-centric scenarios. In this work, we introduce HAMSt3R, an
extension of MASt3R for joint human and scene 3D reconstruction from sparse,
uncalibrated multi-view images. First, we exploit DUNE, a strong image encoder
obtained by distilling, among others, the encoders from MASt3R and from a
state-of-the-art Human Mesh Recovery (HMR) model, multi-HMR, for a better
understanding of scene geometry and human bodies. Our method then incorporates
additional network heads to segment people, estimate dense correspondences via
DensePose, and predict depth in human-centric environments, enabling a more
comprehensive 3D reconstruction. By leveraging the outputs of our different
heads, HAMSt3R produces a dense point map enriched with human semantic
information in 3D. Unlike existing methods that rely on complex optimization
pipelines, our approach is fully feed-forward and efficient, making it suitable
for real-world applications. We evaluate our model on EgoHumans and EgoExo4D,
two challenging benchmarks con taining diverse human-centric scenarios.
Additionally, we validate its generalization to traditional multi-view stereo
and multi-view pose regression tasks. Our results demonstrate that our method
can reconstruct humans effectively while preserving strong performance in
general 3D reconstruction tasks, bridging the gap between human and scene
understanding in 3D vision.

Abstract: Hand-object 3D reconstruction has become increasingly important for
applications in human-robot interaction and immersive AR/VR experiences. A
common approach for object-agnostic hand-object reconstruction from RGB
sequences involves a two-stage pipeline: hand-object 3D tracking followed by
multi-view 3D reconstruction. However, existing methods rely on keypoint
detection techniques, such as Structure from Motion (SfM) and hand-keypoint
optimization, which struggle with diverse object geometries, weak textures, and
mutual hand-object occlusions, limiting scalability and generalization. As a
key enabler to generic and seamless, non-intrusive applicability, we propose in
this work a robust, keypoint detector-free approach to estimating hand-object
3D transformations from monocular motion video/images. We further integrate
this with a multi-view reconstruction pipeline to accurately recover
hand-object 3D shape. Our method, named HOSt3R, is unconstrained, does not rely
on pre-scanned object templates or camera intrinsics, and reaches
state-of-the-art performance for the tasks of object-agnostic hand-object 3D
transformation and shape estimation on the SHOWMe benchmark. We also experiment
on sequences from the HO3D dataset, demonstrating generalization to unseen
object categories.

Method: 构建集成框架，包含尺度感知渲染、生成先验引导优化和渐进式超分辨率三个核心组件，支持整数和非整数尺度渲染。

Conclusion: 该方法成功实现了单一模型的任意尺度3D高斯超分辨率，在保持高质量渲染的同时确保了实时性能，为资源受限场景提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Existing 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) super-resolution methods typically
perform high-resolution (HR) rendering of fixed scale factors, making them
impractical for resource-limited scenarios. Directly rendering arbitrary-scale
HR views with vanilla 3DGS introduces aliasing artifacts due to the lack of
scale-aware rendering ability, while adding a post-processing upsampler for
3DGS complicates the framework and reduces rendering efficiency. To tackle
these issues, we build an integrated framework that incorporates scale-aware
rendering, generative prior-guided optimization, and progressive
super-resolving to enable 3D Gaussian super-resolution of arbitrary scale
factors with a single 3D model. Notably, our approach supports both integer and
non-integer scale rendering to provide more flexibility. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the effectiveness of our model in rendering high-quality
arbitrary-scale HR views (6.59 dB PSNR gain over 3DGS) with a single model. It
preserves structural consistency with LR views and across different scales,
while maintaining real-time rendering speed (85 FPS at 1080p).

Abstract: Recent advancements in video generation have substantially improved visual
quality and temporal coherence, making these models increasingly appealing for
applications such as autonomous driving, particularly in the context of driving
simulation and so-called "world models". In this work, we investigate the
effects of existing fine-tuning video generation approaches on structured
driving datasets and uncover a potential trade-off: although visual fidelity
improves, spatial accuracy in modeling dynamic elements may degrade. We
attribute this degradation to a shift in the alignment between visual quality
and dynamic understanding objectives. In datasets with diverse scene structures
within temporal space, where objects or perspective shift in varied ways, these
objectives tend to highly correlated. However, the very regular and repetitive
nature of driving scenes allows visual quality to improve by modeling dominant
scene motion patterns, without necessarily preserving fine-grained dynamic
behavior. As a result, fine-tuning encourages the model to prioritize
surface-level realism over dynamic accuracy. To further examine this
phenomenon, we show that simple continual learning strategies, such as replay
from diverse domains, can offer a balanced alternative by preserving spatial
accuracy while maintaining strong visual quality.

Abstract: For decades, Computer Vision has aimed at enabling machines to perceive the
external world. Initial limitations led to the development of highly
specialized niches. As success in each task accrued and research progressed,
increasingly complex perception tasks emerged. This survey charts the
convergence of these tasks and, in doing so, introduces Open World Detection
(OWD), an umbrella term we propose to unify class-agnostic and generally
applicable detection models in the vision domain. We start from the history of
foundational vision subdomains and cover key concepts, methodologies and
datasets making up today's state-of-the-art landscape. This traverses topics
starting from early saliency detection, foreground/background separation, out
of distribution detection and leading up to open world object detection,
zero-shot detection and Vision Large Language Models (VLLMs). We explore the
overlap between these subdomains, their increasing convergence, and their
potential to unify into a singular domain in the future, perception.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MV-RAG是一个创新的文本到3D生成方法，通过检索真实2D图像来增强多视角扩散模型，显著改善了罕见概念和域外内容的3D一致性和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文本到3D生成方法在处理域外(OOD)或罕见概念时往往产生不一致或不准确的结果，需要一种能够利用真实世界2D图像数据来提升3D生成质量的方法。

Method: 提出MV-RAG流程：首先从大规模2D图像数据库中检索相关图像，然后用这些图像条件化多视角扩散模型；采用混合训练策略，结合多视角数据和检索的2D图像，使用保持视图预测目标来推断3D一致性。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在域外/罕见概念上显著提升了3D一致性、照片真实感和文本遵循度，同时在标准基准测试中保持竞争力。

Conclusion: MV-RAG通过检索真实2D图像并采用创新的训练策略，成功解决了文本到3D生成在处理罕见概念时的挑战，为3D内容生成提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Text-to-3D generation approaches have advanced significantly by leveraging
pretrained 2D diffusion priors, producing high-quality and 3D-consistent
outputs. However, they often fail to produce out-of-domain (OOD) or rare
concepts, yielding inconsistent or inaccurate results. To this end, we propose
MV-RAG, a novel text-to-3D pipeline that first retrieves relevant 2D images
from a large in-the-wild 2D database and then conditions a multiview diffusion
model on these images to synthesize consistent and accurate multiview outputs.
Training such a retrieval-conditioned model is achieved via a novel hybrid
strategy bridging structured multiview data and diverse 2D image collections.
This involves training on multiview data using augmented conditioning views
that simulate retrieval variance for view-specific reconstruction, alongside
training on sets of retrieved real-world 2D images using a distinctive held-out
view prediction objective: the model predicts the held-out view from the other
views to infer 3D consistency from 2D data. To facilitate a rigorous OOD
evaluation, we introduce a new collection of challenging OOD prompts.
Experiments against state-of-the-art text-to-3D, image-to-3D, and
personalization baselines show that our approach significantly improves 3D
consistency, photorealism, and text adherence for OOD/rare concepts, while
maintaining competitive performance on standard benchmarks.

Conclusion: 提出的监督式会话分割方法能有效捕捉动态用户行为，为会话推荐系统提供重要基础。

Abstract: In information recommendation, a session refers to a sequence of user actions
within a specific time frame. Session-based recommender systems aim to capture
short-term preferences and generate relevant recommendations. However, user
interests may shift even within a session, making appropriate segmentation
essential for modeling dynamic behaviors. In this study, we propose a
supervised session segmentation method based on similarity features derived
from action embeddings and attributes. We compute the similarity scores between
items within a fixed-size window around each candidate segmentation point,
using four types of features: item co-occurrence embeddings, text embeddings of
titles and brands, and price. These features are used to train supervised
classifiers (LightGBM, XGBoost, CatBoost, support vector machine, and logistic
regression) to predict the session boundaries. We construct a manually
annotated dataset from real user browsing histories and evaluate the
segmentation performance using F1-score, area under the precision-recall curve
(PR-AUC), and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. The
LightGBM model achieves the best performance, with an F1-score of 0.806 and a
PR-AUC of 0.831. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
method for session segmentation and its potential to capture dynamic user
behaviors.

Abstract: Building upon the strong sequence modeling capability, Generative
Recommendation (GR) has gradually assumed a dominant position in the
application of recommendation tasks (e.g., video and product recommendation).
However, the application of Generative Recommendation in Point-of-Interest
(POI) recommendation, where user preferences are significantly affected by
spatiotemporal variations, remains a challenging open problem. In this paper,
we propose Spacetime-GR, the first spacetime-aware generative model for
large-scale online POI recommendation. It extends the strong sequence modeling
ability of generative models by incorporating flexible spatiotemporal
information encoding. Specifically, we first introduce a geographic-aware
hierarchical POI indexing strategy to address the challenge of large vocabulary
modeling. Subsequently, a novel spatiotemporal encoding module is introduced to
seamlessly incorporate spatiotemporal context into user action sequences,
thereby enhancing the model's sensitivity to spatiotemporal variations.
Furthermore, we incorporate multimodal POI embeddings to enrich the semantic
understanding of each POI. Finally, to facilitate practical deployment, we
develop a set of post-training adaptation strategies after sufficient
pre-training on action sequences. These strategies enable Spacetime-GR to
generate outputs in multiple formats (i.e., embeddings, ranking scores and POI
candidates) and support a wide range of downstream application scenarios (i.e.,
ranking and end-to-end recommendation). We evaluate the proposed model on both
public benchmark datasets and large-scale industrial datasets, demonstrating
its superior performance over existing methods in terms of POI recommendation
accuracy and ranking quality. Furthermore, the model is the first generative
model deployed in online POI recommendation services that scale to hundreds of
millions of POIs and users.

Abstract: Social Media Popularity Prediction is a complex multimodal task that requires
effective integration of images, text, and structured information. However,
current approaches suffer from inadequate visual-textual alignment and fail to
capture the inherent cross-content correlations and hierarchical patterns in
social media data. To overcome these limitations, we establish a multi-class
framework , introducing hierarchical prototypes for structural enhancement and
contrastive learning for improved vision-text alignment. Furthermore, we
propose a feature-enhanced framework integrating dual-grained prompt learning
and cross-modal attention mechanisms, achieving precise multimodal
representation through fine-grained category modeling. Experimental results
demonstrate state-of-the-art performance on benchmark metrics, establishing new
reference standards for multimodal social media analysis.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: EGRA是一个多模态推荐系统，通过预训练模型构建物品关系图来增强行为图，并引入双层动态对齐机制来改善模态-行为表示对齐，显著提升了推荐性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态推荐方法存在两个关键局限：1) 使用原始模态特征构建物品关系图时未能平衡协同过滤和模态感知语义，且无法有效处理模态噪声；2) 使用统一的对齐权重和固定对齐强度，限制了模态-行为对齐的效果。

Method: EGRA采用预训练MMR模型生成表示来构建物品关系图，增强行为图的鲁棒性；提出双层动态对齐权重机制，根据实体对齐程度动态分配对齐强度，并在训练过程中逐步增加整体对齐强度。

Result: 在五个数据集上的大量实验表明，EGRA显著优于现有方法，验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: EGRA通过创新的图构建方法和动态对齐机制，有效解决了多模态推荐中的稀疏性和对齐问题，为提升推荐质量提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: MultiModal Recommendation (MMR) systems have emerged as a promising solution
for improving recommendation quality by leveraging rich item-side modality
information, prompting a surge of diverse methods. Despite these advances,
existing methods still face two critical limitations. First, they use raw
modality features to construct item-item links for enriching the behavior
graph, while giving limited attention to balancing collaborative and
modality-aware semantics or mitigating modality noise in the process. Second,
they use a uniform alignment weight across all entities and also maintain a
fixed alignment strength throughout training, limiting the effectiveness of
modality-behavior alignment. To address these challenges, we propose EGRA.
First, instead of relying on raw modality features, it alleviates sparsity by
incorporating into the behavior graph an item-item graph built from
representations generated by a pretrained MMR model. This enables the graph to
capture both collaborative patterns and modality aware similarities with
enhanced robustness against modality noise. Moreover, it introduces a novel
bi-level dynamic alignment weighting mechanism to improve modality-behavior
representation alignment, which dynamically assigns alignment strength across
entities according to their alignment degree, while gradually increasing the
overall alignment intensity throughout training. Extensive experiments on five
datasets show that EGRA significantly outperforms recent methods, confirming
its effectiveness.

TL;DR: DUP-OT是一个用于非重叠跨域推荐的新框架，通过高斯混合模型和最优传输技术解决无共享用户/物品时的知识迁移问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统跨域推荐系统需要重叠用户或物品，这在现实场景中往往不现实。非重叠跨域推荐面临两大挑战：缺乏直接桥梁和分布差异大，同时现有方法无法捕捉用户偏好的细粒度多面性

Method: 三阶段框架：1)共享预处理，使用基于评论的嵌入和自编码器编码用户和物品；2)用户GMM权重学习，将用户偏好建模为带学习权重的高斯混合模型；3)跨域评分预测，通过最优传输对齐不同域的高斯组件

Result: 在Amazon评论数据集上的实验表明，DUP-OT能有效缓解域间差异，在非重叠跨域推荐设置下优于最先进的基线方法

Conclusion: DUP-OT为非重叠跨域推荐提供了一个有效的解决方案，通过分布式的用户偏好表示和最优传输技术成功实现了跨域知识迁移

Abstract: Cross-Domain Recommender (CDR) systems aim to transfer knowledge from dense
to sparse domains, alleviating data sparsity and cold-start issues in
single-domain recommendation. While many methods assume overlapping users or
items to connect domains, this is often unrealistic in real-world settings.
Thus, non-overlapping CDR systems, which require no shared users or items, are
needed.
  However, non-overlapping CDR is challenging due to: (1) the absence of
overlap preventing direct bridges between domains, and (2) large distributional
discrepancies degrading transfer performance. Moreover, most recommenders
represent user preferences as discrete vectors, failing to capture their
fine-grained, multi-faceted nature.
  We propose DUP-OT (Distributional User Preferences with Optimal Transport), a
framework for non-overlapping CDR. DUP-OT has three stages: (1) Shared
Preprocessing, where review-based embeddings and an autoencoder encode users
and items from both domains; (2) User GMM Weight Learning, which models user
preferences as Gaussian mixtures with learned weights; and (3) Cross-domain
Rating Prediction, where optimal transport aligns Gaussian components across
domains, enabling preference transfer from source to target.
  Experiments on Amazon review datasets show that DUP-OT effectively mitigates
domain discrepancy and outperforms state-of-the-art baselines under the
non-overlapping CDR setting.

Motivation: 现有检索增强生成方法在复杂推理导向的多跳检索任务中存在三个主要挑战：推理导向规划无效、推理驱动检索次优、推理引导过滤不足，这些问题源于检索与推理之间的弱耦合

Conclusion: OPERA通过强化检索与推理的耦合关系，有效解决了复杂多跳检索任务中的关键挑战，为推理驱动检索提供了新的解决方案

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and dense retrievers have
driven significant progress in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). However,
existing approaches face significant challenges in complex reasoning-oriented
multi-hop retrieval tasks: 1) Ineffective reasoning-oriented planning: Prior
methods struggle to generate robust multi-step plans for complex queries, as
rule-based decomposers perform poorly on out-of-template questions. 2)
Suboptimal reasoning-driven retrieval: Related methods employ limited query
reformulation, leading to iterative retrieval loops that often fail to locate
golden documents. 3) Insufficient reasoning-guided filtering: Prevailing
methods lack the fine-grained reasoning to effectively filter salient
information from noisy results, hindering utilization of retrieved knowledge.
Fundamentally, these limitations all stem from the weak coupling between
retrieval and reasoning in current RAG architectures. We introduce the
Orchestrated Planner-Executor Reasoning Architecture (OPERA), a novel
reasoning-driven retrieval framework. OPERA's Goal Planning Module (GPM)
decomposes questions into sub-goals, which are executed by a Reason-Execute
Module (REM) with specialized components for precise reasoning and effective
retrieval. To train OPERA, we propose Multi-Agents Progressive Group Relative
Policy Optimization (MAPGRPO), a novel variant of GRPO. Experiments on complex
multi-hop benchmarks show OPERA's superior performance, validating both the
MAPGRPO method and OPERA's design. Code is available at

TL;DR: GNAQ是一种基于图结构的动态量化方法，通过节点感知的动态量化策略和图关系感知梯度估计，在保持GNN推荐系统性能的同时显著减少模型大小和计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图神经网络在推荐系统中表现优异，但在资源受限的边缘设备上部署时面临高嵌入参数需求和计算成本的挑战。传统量化方法直接应用于节点嵌入会忽略图结构，导致消息传递中的误差累积和量化嵌入质量下降。

Method: 提出GNAQ方法：1）基于节点特征分布初始化量化区间；2）通过GNN层消息传递动态细化量化尺度；3）使用图关系感知梯度估计替代传统直通估计器；4）适应个体节点嵌入的节点感知动态量化策略。

Result: 在四个真实数据集上的实验表明，GNAQ在2位量化下比最先进方法平均提升27.8% Recall@10和17.6% NDCG@10。能够保持全精度模型性能的同时将模型大小减少8-12倍，训练速度比基线量化方法快两倍。

Conclusion: GNAQ通过有效利用图结构信息，在推荐系统的图神经网络量化中实现了效率与精度的良好平衡，为边缘设备部署提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: In the realm of collaborative filtering recommendation systems, Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated remarkable performance but face significant
challenges in deployment on resource-constrained edge devices due to their high
embedding parameter requirements and computational costs. Using common
quantization method directly on node embeddings may overlooks their graph based
structure, causing error accumulation during message passing and degrading the
quality of quantized embeddings.To address this, we propose Graph based
Node-Aware Dynamic Quantization training for collaborative filtering (GNAQ), a
novel quantization approach that leverages graph structural information to
enhance the balance between efficiency and accuracy of GNNs for Top-K
recommendation. GNAQ introduces a node-aware dynamic quantization strategy that
adapts quantization scales to individual node embeddings by incorporating graph
interaction relationships. Specifically, it initializes quantization intervals
based on node-wise feature distributions and dynamically refines them through
message passing in GNN layers. This approach mitigates information loss caused
by fixed quantization scales and captures hierarchical semantic features in
user-item interaction graphs. Additionally, GNAQ employs graph relation-aware
gradient estimation to replace traditional straight-through estimators,
ensuring more accurate gradient propagation during training. Extensive
experiments on four real-world datasets demonstrate that GNAQ outperforms
state-of-the-art quantization methods, including BiGeaR and N2UQ, by achieving
average improvement in 27.8\% Recall@10 and 17.6\% NDCG@10 under 2-bit
quantization. In particular, GNAQ is capable of maintaining the performance of
full-precision models while reducing their model sizes by 8 to 12 times; in
addition, the training time is twice as fast compared to quantization baseline
methods.

Result: 实验显示DT指标平均提升10.6%，且不损害CTR性能

Conclusion: ORCA是模型无关且易于部署的解决方案，有效缓解了多任务学习中对伪相关的过度依赖问题

Abstract: Dwell time (DT) is a critical post-click metric for evaluating user
preference in recommender systems, complementing the traditional click-through
rate (CTR). Although multi-task learning is widely adopted to jointly optimize
DT and CTR, we observe that multi-task models systematically collapse their DT
predictions to the shortest and longest bins, under-predicting the moderate
durations. We attribute this moderate-duration bin under-representation to
over-reliance on the CTR-DT spurious correlation, and propose ORCA to address
it with causal-decoupling. Specifically, ORCA explicitly models and subtracts
CTR's negative transfer while preserving its positive transfer. We further
introduce (i) feature-level counterfactual intervention, and (ii) a
task-interaction module with instance inverse-weighting, weakening CTR-mediated
effect and restoring direct DT semantics. ORCA is model-agnostic and easy to
deploy. Experiments show an average 10.6% lift in DT metrics without harming
CTR. Code is available at

Abstract: Understanding how prenatal exposure to psychoactive substances such as

complicated by the complexity of multimodal neuroimaging data and the
limitations of conventional analytic methods. Existing approaches often fail to
fully capture the complementary features embedded within structural and
functional connectomes, constraining both biological insight and predictive

networks utilizing neural Koopman operator-driven latent space fusion. By
leveraging Koopman theory, NeuroKoop unifies node embeddings derived from
source-based morphometry (SBM) and functional network connectivity (FNC) based
brain graphs, resulting in enhanced representation learning and more robust
classification of prenatal drug exposure (PDE) status. Applied to a large
adolescent cohort from the ABCD dataset, NeuroKoop outperformed relevant
baselines and revealed salient structural-functional connections, advancing our
understanding of the neurodevelopmental impact of PDE.

(LTLf), directly into deep learning architectures for sequence-based tasks. We
extend the Iterative Local Refinement (ILR) neurosymbolic algorithm, leveraging
the recent introduction of fuzzy LTLf interpretations. We name this proposed
method Temporal Iterative Local Refinement (T-ILR). We assess T-ILR on an
existing benchmark for temporal neurosymbolic architectures, consisting of the
classification of image sequences in the presence of temporal knowledge. The
results demonstrate improved accuracy and computational efficiency compared to
the state-of-the-art method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决AI基础ECG预测模型在临床实践中的可解释性需求，以便更好地集成到临床决策中

Method: 发展CoFE框架，生成反事实ECG来展示特定特征（如振幅和间期）对模型预测的影响

Result: 在房颤分类和钾水平回归模型中验证，CoFE揭示的ECG信号特征变化与已知临床知识一致

Conclusion: 该框架能够明确显示ECG中有效特征的位置和影响方式，有助于提升AI-ECG模型的可解释性和临床决策效果

Abstract: Recognizing the need for explainable AI (XAI) approaches to enable the
successful integration of AI-based ECG prediction models (AI-ECG) into clinical
practice, we introduce a framework generating \textbf{Co}unter\textbf{F}actual
\textbf{E}CGs (i,e., named CoFE) to illustrate how specific features, such as
amplitudes and intervals, influence the model's predictive decisions. To
demonstrate the applicability of the CoFE, we present two case studies: atrial
fibrillation classification and potassium level regression models. The CoFE
reveals feature changes in ECG signals that align with the established clinical
knowledge. By clarifying both \textbf{where valid features appear} in the ECG
and \textbf{how they influence the model's predictions}, we anticipate that our
framework will enhance the interpretability of AI-ECG models and support more
effective clinical decision-making. Our demonstration video is available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖顺序检索和推理，容易因中间步骤错误而失败，且多模态模型训练成本高昂。需要一种无需训练、能灵活探索推理路径的解决方案。

Method: 采用自适应规划图框架，包含规划模块（分析当前状态并决定下一步行动）、检索模块（针对不同模态的动态适配策略）和推理模块，实现动态灵活的推理路径探索。

Result: 在MultimodalQA和WebQA数据集上的实验表明，该方法无需训练即可匹配或超越依赖训练的现有模型性能。

Conclusion: 提出的训练免费框架通过自适应规划图有效解决了多模态多跳问答中的错误传播和训练成本问题，为多模态推理提供了灵活高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Multimodal Multi-hop question answering requires integrating information from
diverse sources, such as images and texts, to derive answers. Existing methods
typically rely on sequential retrieval and reasoning, where each step builds on
the previous output. However, this single-path paradigm makes them vulnerable
to errors due to misleading intermediate steps. Moreover, developing multimodal
models can be computationally expensive, often requiring extensive training. To
address these limitations, we propose a training-free framework guided by an
Adaptive Planning Graph, which consists of planning, retrieval and reasoning
modules. The planning module analyzes the current state of the Adaptive
Planning Graph, determines the next action and where to expand the graph, which
enables dynamic and flexible exploration of reasoning paths. To handle
retrieval of text to unspecified target modalities, we devise modality-specific
strategies that dynamically adapt to distinct data types. Our approach
preserves the characteristics of multimodal information without costly
task-specific training, enabling seamless integration with up-to-date models.
Finally, the experiments on MultimodalQA and WebQA show that our approach
matches or outperforms existing models that rely on training.

TL;DR: GDP是一个多模态基础模型，通过CNN-Transformer编码器处理结构化EHR时间序列数据，并与非结构化临床笔记融合，在临床预测和叙事生成任务上均表现出色


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电子健康记录(EHRs)包含丰富的多模态临床数据，但现有方法简单地将数值数据序列化为文本会丢失时间和定量细节，需要开发能够原生处理多模态EHR数据的基础模型

Method: 两阶段训练：1)生成式预训练，通过掩码特征预测和下一时间步预测学习时间动态；2)多任务微调，用于临床预测任务。采用CNN-Transformer编码器处理结构化时间序列，通过跨模态注意力与LLaMA解码器融合

Result: 在MIMIC-IV数据集上：心衰预测AUROC=0.923，2型糖尿病AUROC=0.817，30天再入院AUROC=0.627；叙事生成ROUGE-L=0.135，BERTScore-F1=0.545；人工评估显示在忠实性、流畅性和临床实用性方面表现最佳

Conclusion: 单一多模态基础模型能够同时预测临床可操作事件并生成高质量临床叙事，GDP的灵活架构可扩展到其他模态，有望减少医院文档工作量而不牺牲准确性

Abstract: Electronic health records (EHRs) are rich clinical data sources but complex
repositories of patient data, spanning structured elements (demographics,
vitals, lab results, codes), unstructured clinical notes and other modalities
of data. Harnessing this heterogeneity is critical for improving patient
outcomes. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled
foundation models that can learn from multiple data modalities and support
clinical tasks. However, most current approaches simply serialize numeric EHR
data into text, which risks losing temporal and quantitative detail. We
introduce Generative Deep Patient (GDP), a multimodal foundation model that
natively encodes structured EHR time-series via a CNN-Transformer encoder and
fuses it with unstructured EHRs through cross-modal attention into a
LLaMA-based decoder. GDP is trained in two stages: (1) generative pretraining,
where it learns to produce clinical narratives from raw patient timelines while
also performing masked feature prediction (MFP) and next time-step prediction
(NTP) to capture temporal dynamics; and (2) multi-task fine-tuning for
clinically meaningful predictions (e.g., heart failure, type 2 diabetes, 30-day
readmission). In clinical prediction, GDP demonstrated superior performance on
MIMIC-IV: heart failure AUROC = 0.923, type 2 diabetes AUROC = 0.817, and
30-day readmission AUROC = 0.627. For narrative generation, GDP achieved
ROUGE-L = 0.135 and BERTScore-F1 = 0.545. In a blinded human evaluation,
GDP-Instruct scored highest on faithfulness, fluency, and overall clinical
utility, suggesting reduced hospital documentation workload without sacrificing
accuracy. Our results demonstrate that a single multimodal foundation model can
both predict clinically actionable events and generate high-quality clinical
narratives. Furthermore, GDP's flexible architecture can be extended to
additional modalities.

TL;DR: MSEF框架通过多层可引导嵌入融合，解决了LLM在时间序列预测中TS信息在深层逐渐消失的问题，在7个基准测试中平均MSE降低31.8%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将时间序列信息浅层集成到LLM中，导致TS表示在深层逐渐消失，造成文本嵌入与TS表示之间的适配失效。

Method: 利用现成的时间序列基础模型提取语义丰富的嵌入，通过层特定引导向量在LLM各层中间与文本表示融合，实现跨层TS信息访问。

Result: 在7个基准测试中相比基线方法表现显著提升，平均MSE降低31.8%。

Conclusion: MSEF框架通过多层融合机制有效缓解了TS信息在LLM深层消失的问题，实现了更好的少样本学习能力。

Abstract: Time series (TS) data are ubiquitous across various application areas,
rendering time series forecasting (TSF) a fundamental task. With the astounding
advances in large language models (LLMs), a variety of methods have been
developed to adapt LLMs for time series forecasting. Despite unlocking the
potential of LLMs in comprehending TS data, existing methods are inherently
constrained by their shallow integration of TS information, wherein LLMs
typically access TS representations at shallow layers, primarily at the input
layer. This causes the influence of TS representations to progressively fade in
deeper layers and eventually leads to ineffective adaptation between textual
embeddings and TS representations. In this paper, we propose the Multi-layer
Steerable Embedding Fusion (MSEF), a novel framework that enables LLMs to
directly access time series patterns at all depths, thereby mitigating the
progressive loss of TS information in deeper layers. Specifically, MSEF
leverages off-the-shelf time series foundation models to extract semantically
rich embeddings, which are fused with intermediate text representations across
LLM layers via layer-specific steering vectors. These steering vectors are
designed to continuously optimize the alignment between time series and textual
modalities and facilitate a layer-specific adaptation mechanism that ensures
efficient few-shot learning capabilities. Experimental results on seven
benchmarks demonstrate significant performance improvements by MSEF compared
with baselines, with an average reduction of 31.8% in terms of MSE. The code is

TL;DR: 本文提出了InMind评估框架，用于测试LLMs在社交推理游戏中捕捉和应用个性化推理风格的能力，发现当前LLMs在个体化适应性推理方面存在局限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估往往忽视了个体化推理风格对社交情境理解的影响，而社交推理游戏为评估这种个性化推理提供了自然测试平台。

Method: 开发InMind框架，通过增强结构化游戏数据（包含回合级策略追踪和赛后反思），在观察者和参与者两种模式下收集数据，支持4个认知驱动的评估任务。

Result: 通用LLMs（包括GPT-4o）过度依赖词汇线索，难以在时间游戏中锚定反思或适应动态策略；而推理增强型LLMs（如DeepSeek-R1）展现出风格敏感推理的早期迹象。

Conclusion: 当前LLMs在个体化适应性推理能力上存在关键局限，InMind框架为认知对齐的人机交互迈出了重要一步。

Abstract: LLMs have shown strong performance on human-centric reasoning tasks. While
previous evaluations have explored whether LLMs can infer intentions or detect
deception, they often overlook the individualized reasoning styles that
influence how people interpret and act in social contexts. Social deduction
games (SDGs) provide a natural testbed for evaluating individualized reasoning
styles, where different players may adopt diverse but contextually valid
reasoning strategies under identical conditions. To address this, we introduce
InMind, a cognitively grounded evaluation framework designed to assess whether
LLMs can capture and apply personalized reasoning styles in SDGs. InMind
enhances structured gameplay data with round-level strategy traces and
post-game reflections, collected under both Observer and Participant modes. It
supports four cognitively motivated tasks that jointly evaluate both static
alignment and dynamic adaptation. As a case study, we apply InMind to the game
Avalon, evaluating 11 state-of-the-art LLMs. General-purpose LLMs, even GPT-4o
frequently rely on lexical cues, struggling to anchor reflections in temporal
gameplay or adapt to evolving strategies. In contrast, reasoning-enhanced LLMs
like DeepSeek-R1 exhibit early signs of style-sensitive reasoning. These
findings reveal key limitations in current LLMs' capacity for individualized,
adaptive reasoning, and position InMind as a step toward cognitively aligned
human-AI interaction.

Motivation: 全球食品领域存在大量科学、文化和商业声明，但缺乏系统的基础设施来追踪、验证和情境化这些声明，导致消费者难以辨别真伪

Method: 基于FKG.in印度食品知识图谱，设计本体论和半自动化知识管理流程，使用Reddit数据和大型语言模型开发FCN概念验证，整合结构化模式和溯源感知管道

Result: 开发了食品声明可追溯网络的概念验证，能够对食品相关声明进行提取和验证，方法具有应用无关性，可适应不同地理、烹饪或监管环境

Conclusion: 通过结构化、可验证和可解释的方式建模食品声明及其可追溯性，有助于建立更透明和负责任的食品知识生态系统，支持研究人员、政策制定者和消费者

Abstract: The global food landscape is rife with scientific, cultural, and commercial
claims about what foods are, what they do, what they should not do, or should
not do. These range from rigorously studied health benefits (probiotics improve
gut health) and misrepresentations (soaked almonds make one smarter) to vague
promises (superfoods boost immunity) and culturally rooted beliefs (cold foods
cause coughs). Despite their widespread influence, the infrastructure for
tracing, verifying, and contextualizing these claims remains fragmented and
underdeveloped. In this paper, we propose a Food Claim-Traceability Network
(FCN) as an extension of FKG.in, a knowledge graph of Indian food that we have
been incrementally building. We also present the ontology design and the
semi-automated knowledge curation workflow that we used to develop a proof of
concept of FKG.in-FCN using Reddit data and Large Language Models. FCN
integrates curated data inputs, structured schemas, and provenance-aware
pipelines for food-related claim extraction and validation. While directly
linked to the Indian food knowledge graph as an application, our methodology
remains application-agnostic and adaptable to other geographic, culinary, or
regulatory settings. By modeling food claims and their traceability in a
structured, verifiable, and explainable way, we aim to contribute to more
transparent and accountable food knowledge ecosystems, supporting researchers,
policymakers, and most importantly, everyday consumers in navigating a world
saturated with dietary assertions.

Conclusion: 该框架成功模拟了专家驱动的红外分析流程，提高了结构解析的整体准确性，并具有内在可扩展性

Abstract: Spectral analysis provides crucial clues for the elucidation of unknown
materials. Among various techniques, infrared spectroscopy (IR) plays an
important role in laboratory settings due to its high accessibility and low
cost. However, existing approaches often fail to reflect expert analytical
processes and lack flexibility in incorporating diverse types of chemical
knowledge, which is essential in real-world analytical scenarios. In this
paper, we propose IR-Agent, a novel multi-agent framework for molecular
structure elucidation from IR spectra. The framework is designed to emulate
expert-driven IR analysis procedures and is inherently extensible. Each agent
specializes in a specific aspect of IR interpretation, and their complementary
roles enable integrated reasoning, thereby improving the overall accuracy of
structure elucidation. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that
IR-Agent not only improves baseline performance on experimental IR spectra but
also shows strong adaptability to various forms of chemical information.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于LLM的AI系统无法可靠检索所有竞争药物名称，且缺乏公认的公共基准测试。药物竞争数据具有投资者特定性、付费墙限制、跨注册表分散、本体论不匹配、别名繁多、多模态和快速变化等特点。

Method: 使用LLM代理将5年多模态非结构化尽职调查备忘录转换为结构化评估语料库，建立指示到竞争药物的映射。引入竞争对手验证LLM作为评判代理，过滤假阳性以最大化精确度并抑制幻觉。

Result: 竞争对手发现代理达到83%的召回率，超过OpenAI Deep Research（65%）和Perplexity Labs（60%）。在生物技术VC基金案例中，分析师处理时间从2.5天降至约3小时（约20倍提升）。

Conclusion: 该系统已部署到企业用户生产环境中，证明了在药物竞争分析任务中LLM代理系统的有效性和实用性，显著提高了分析效率和准确性。

Abstract: In this paper, we describe and benchmark a competitor-discovery component
used within an agentic AI system for fast drug asset due diligence. A
competitor-discovery AI agent, given an indication, retrieves all drugs
comprising the competitive landscape of that indication and extracts canonical
attributes for these drugs. The competitor definition is investor-specific, and
data is paywalled/licensed, fragmented across registries, ontology-mismatched
by indication, alias-heavy for drug names, multimodal, and rapidly changing.
Although considered the best tool for this problem, the current LLM-based AI
systems aren't capable of reliably retrieving all competing drug names, and
there is no accepted public benchmark for this task. To address the lack of
evaluation, we use LLM-based agents to transform five years of multi-modal,
unstructured diligence memos from a private biotech VC fund into a structured
evaluation corpus mapping indications to competitor drugs with normalized
attributes. We also introduce a competitor validating LLM-as-a-judge agent that
filters out false positives from the list of predicted competitors to maximize
precision and suppress hallucinations. On this benchmark, our
competitor-discovery agent achieves 83% recall, exceeding OpenAI Deep Research
(65%) and Perplexity Labs (60%). The system is deployed in production with
enterprise users; in a case study with a biotech VC investment fund, analyst
turnaround time dropped from 2.5 days to $\sim$3 hours ($\sim$20x) for the
competitive analysis.

Conclusion: MM-Retinal-Reason数据集和OphthaReason模型填补了医学多模态推理领域的空白，能够模拟真实临床思维模式，在眼科诊断推理方面表现出色

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have recently demonstrated
remarkable reasoning abilities with reinforcement learning paradigm. Although
several multimodal reasoning models have been explored in the medical domain,
most of them focus exclusively on basic reasoning, which refers to shallow
inference based on visual feature matching. However, real-world clinical
diagnosis extends beyond basic reasoning, demanding reasoning processes that
integrate heterogeneous clinical information (such as chief complaints and
medical history) with multimodal medical imaging data. To bridge this gap, we
introduce MM-Retinal-Reason, the first ophthalmic multimodal dataset with the
full spectrum of perception and reasoning. It encompasses both basic reasoning
tasks and complex reasoning tasks, aiming to enhance visual-centric fundamental
reasoning capabilities and emulate realistic clinical thinking patterns.
Building upon MM-Retinal-Reason, we propose OphthaReason, the first
ophthalmology-specific multimodal reasoning model with step-by-step reasoning
traces. To enable flexible adaptation to both basic and complex reasoning
tasks, we specifically design a novel method called Uncertainty-Aware Dynamic
Thinking (UADT), which estimates sample-level uncertainty via entropy and
dynamically modulates the model's exploration depth using a shaped advantage
mechanism. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our model achieves
state-of-the-art performance on both basic and complex reasoning tasks,
outperforming general-purpose MLLMs, medical MLLMs, RL-based medical MLLMs, and
ophthalmic MLLMs by at least 24.92\%, 15.00\%, 21.20\%, and 17.66\%. Project

Abstract: Understanding human behavior in urban environments is a crucial field within
city sciences. However, collecting accurate behavioral data, particularly in
newly developed areas, poses significant challenges. Recent advances in
generative agents, powered by Large Language Models (LLMs), have shown promise
in simulating human behaviors without relying on extensive datasets.
Nevertheless, these methods often struggle with generating consistent,
context-sensitive, and realistic behavioral outputs. To address these
limitations, this paper introduces the Preference Chain, a novel method that
integrates Graph Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with LLMs to enhance
context-aware simulation of human behavior in transportation systems.
Experiments conducted on the Replica dataset demonstrate that the Preference
Chain outperforms standard LLM in aligning with real-world transportation mode
choices. The development of the Mobility Agent highlights potential
applications of proposed method in urban mobility modeling for emerging cities,
personalized travel behavior analysis, and dynamic traffic forecasting. Despite
limitations such as slow inference and the risk of hallucination, the method
offers a promising framework for simulating complex human behavior in
data-scarce environments, where traditional data-driven models struggle due to
limited data availability.

Motivation: 现有模型融合方法需要手动划分参数组，限制了组合探索和性能提升，需要一种更灵活自动的融合方法。

Conclusion: M2N2展示了模型融合的强大潜力，提供了一种鲁棒且通用的自动化模型集成方法，为模型进化开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Model merging is a powerful technique for integrating the specialized
knowledge of multiple machine learning models into a single model. However,
existing methods require manually partitioning model parameters into fixed
groups for merging, which restricts the exploration of potential combinations
and limits performance. To overcome these limitations, we propose Model Merging
of Natural Niches (M2N2), an evolutionary algorithm with three key features:
(1) dynamic adjustment of merging boundaries to progressively explore a broader
range of parameter combinations; (2) a diversity preservation mechanism
inspired by the competition for resources in nature, to maintain a population
of diverse, high-performing models that are particularly well-suited for
merging; and (3) a heuristicbased attraction metric to identify the most
promising pairs of models for fusion. Our experimental results demonstrate, for
the first time, that model merging can be used to evolve models entirely from
scratch. Specifically, we apply M2N2 to evolve MNIST classifiers from scratch
and achieve performance comparable to CMA-ES, while being computationally more
efficient. Furthermore, M2N2 scales to merge specialized language and image
generation models, achieving state-of-the-art performance. Notably, it
preserves crucial model capabilities beyond those explicitly optimized by the
fitness function, highlighting its robustness and versatility. Our code is

Motivation: 解决"机器能否成长"这一图灵测试的自然后继问题，将人类成长过程概念化地移植到人工智能评估中

Method: 基于六个主要标准(C1-C6)的游戏化测试系统，分为四个竞技场，使用标准化AI日志记录所有决策和行动，采用专家先验方法确定权重，计算算术平均的成长指数

Result: 该方法能够对不同类型AI实体(机器人、软件代理、LLMs)进行一致可比较的"成长"水平评估，多游戏结构能识别强项和薄弱环节

Conclusion: GROW-AI通过结合心理学、机器人学、计算机科学和伦理学的综合测试格式，不仅测量性能还捕捉AI实体向成熟度进化的路径，保证了评估的可追溯性和可复现性

Abstract: This study aims to extend the framework for assessing artificial
intelligence, called GROW-AI (Growth and Realization of Autonomous Wisdom),
designed to answer the question "Can machines grow up?" -- a natural successor
to the Turing Test. The methodology applied is based on a system of six primary
criteria (C1-C6), each assessed through a specific "game", divided into four
arenas that explore both the human dimension and its transposition into AI. All
decisions and actions of the entity are recorded in a standardized AI Journal,
the primary source for calculating composite scores. The assessment uses the
prior expert method to establish initial weights, and the global score -- Grow
Up Index -- is calculated as the arithmetic mean of the six scores, with
interpretation on maturity thresholds. The results show that the methodology
allows for a coherent and comparable assessment of the level of "growth" of AI
entities, regardless of their type (robots, software agents, LLMs). The
multi-game structure highlights strengths and vulnerable areas, and the use of
a unified journal guarantees traceability and replicability in the evaluation.
The originality of the work lies in the conceptual transposition of the process
of "growing" from the human world to that of artificial intelligence, in an
integrated testing format that combines perspectives from psychology, robotics,
computer science, and ethics. Through this approach, GROW-AI not only measures
performance but also captures the evolutionary path of an AI entity towards

enhancing their capacity to address real-world tasks. In line with such an
evolution, AgentScope introduces major improvements in a new version (1.0),
towards comprehensively supporting flexible and efficient tool-based
agent-environment interactions for building agentic applications. Specifically,
we abstract foundational components essential for agentic applications and

we ground agent behaviors in the ReAct paradigm and offer advanced agent-level
infrastructure based on a systematic asynchronous design, which enriches both
human-agent and agent-agent interaction patterns while improving execution
efficiency. Building on this foundation, we integrate several built-in agents
tailored to specific practical scenarios. AgentScope also includes robust
engineering support for developer-friendly experiences. We provide a scalable
evaluation module with a visual studio interface, making the development of
long-trajectory agentic applications more manageable and easier to trace. In
addition, AgentScope offers a runtime sandbox to ensure safe agent execution
and facilitates rapid deployment in production environments. With these
enhancements, AgentScope provides a practical foundation for building scalable,
adaptive, and effective agentic applications.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了Instruct-Verify-and-Act (IVA)框架，用于处理视觉-语言-动作模型中的错误前提指令问题，通过检测、澄清和执行三个步骤提升机器人对错误指令的响应能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉-语言-动作模型在处理包含错误前提的自然语言指令时表现不佳，这些指令引用了环境中不存在的对象或条件，需要模型能够识别并适当响应这类错误指令。

Method: 构建大规模指令调优设置，使用结构化语言提示训练VLA模型；创建包含配对正确和错误前提指令的半合成数据集；开发IVA框架，包含检测不可执行指令、语言澄清和基于感知的动作执行三个模块。

Result: IVA框架将错误前提检测准确率提升97.56%，在错误前提场景中的成功响应率提高50.78%。

Conclusion: IVA框架有效解决了VLA模型处理错误前提指令的问题，通过统一的检测-澄清-执行流程显著提升了模型在真实场景中的鲁棒性和实用性。

Abstract: Recently, Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have demonstrated strong
performance on a range of robotic tasks. These models rely on multimodal
inputs, with language instructions playing a crucial role -- not only in
predicting actions, but also in robustly interpreting user intent, even when
the requests are impossible to fulfill. In this work, we investigate how VLAs
can recognize, interpret, and respond to false-premise instructions: natural
language commands that reference objects or conditions absent from the
environment. We propose Instruct-Verify-and-Act (IVA), a unified framework that
(i) detects when an instruction cannot be executed due to a false premise, (ii)
engages in language-based clarification or correction, and (iii) grounds
plausible alternatives in perception and action. Towards this end, we construct
a large-scale instruction tuning setup with structured language prompts and
train a VLA model capable of handling both accurate and erroneous requests. Our
approach leverages a contextually augmented, semi-synthetic dataset containing
paired positive and false-premise instructions, enabling robust detection and
natural language correction. Our experiments show that IVA improves false
premise detection accuracy by 97.56% over baselines, while increasing
successful responses in false-premise scenarios by 50.78%.

Conclusion: 因果感知的深度学习框架能够有效识别因果相关特征，显著提升波束对齐效率并降低系统开销

Abstract: Efficient and reliable beam alignment is a critical requirement for mmWave
multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, especially in 6G and beyond,
where communication must be fast, adaptive, and resilient to real-world
uncertainties. Existing deep learning (DL)-based beam alignment methods often
neglect the underlying causal relationships between inputs and outputs, leading
to limited interpretability, poor generalization, and unnecessary beam sweeping
overhead. In this work, we propose a causally-aware DL framework that
integrates causal discovery into beam management pipeline. Particularly, we
propose a novel two-stage causal beam selection algorithm to identify a minimal
set of relevant inputs for beam prediction. First, causal discovery learns a
Bayesian graph capturing dependencies between received power inputs and the
optimal beam. Then, this graph guides causal feature selection for the DL-based
classifier. Simulation results reveal that the proposed causal beam selection
matches the performance of conventional methods while drastically reducing
input selection time by 94.4% and beam sweeping overhead by 59.4% by focusing
only on causally relevant features.

Result: 在Class-IL和MTIL两种零样本增量协议下的14个数据集上验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: MoDER方法成功地将零样本能力的保持转变为增强，为视觉语言模型在持续学习中的实际应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The advent of pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) has significantly
transformed Continual Learning (CL), mainly due to their zero-shot
classification abilities. Such proficiency makes VLMs well-suited for
real-world applications, enabling robust performance on novel unseen classes
without requiring adaptation. However, fine-tuning remains essential when
downstream tasks deviate significantly from the pre-training domain. Prior CL
approaches primarily focus on preserving the zero-shot capabilities of VLMs
during incremental fine-tuning on a downstream task. We take a step further by
devising an approach that transforms preservation into enhancement of the
zero-shot capabilities of VLMs. Our approach, named MoDular Embedding
Recomposition (MoDER), introduces a modular framework that trains multiple
textual experts, each specialized in a single seen class, and stores them in a
foundational hub. At inference time, for each unseen class, we query the hub
and compose the retrieved experts to synthesize a refined prototype that
improves classification. We show the effectiveness of our method across two
popular zero-shot incremental protocols, Class-IL and MTIL, comprising a total
of 14 datasets. The codebase is available at

Conclusion: 扩散模型架构在神经符号学习领域展现出强大潜力，能够有效解决逻辑推理问题并保持输出的一致性

Abstract: Enabling neural networks to learn complex logical constraints and fulfill
symbolic reasoning is a critical challenge. Bridging this gap often requires
guiding the neural network's output distribution to move closer to the symbolic
constraints. While diffusion models have shown remarkable generative capability
across various domains, we employ the powerful architecture to perform
neuro-symbolic learning and solve logical puzzles. Our diffusion-based pipeline
adopts a two-stage training strategy: the first stage focuses on cultivating
basic reasoning abilities, while the second emphasizes systematic learning of
logical constraints. To impose hard constraints on neural outputs in the second
stage, we formulate the diffusion reasoner as a Markov decision process and
innovatively fine-tune it with an improved proximal policy optimization
algorithm. We utilize a rule-based reward signal derived from the logical
consistency of neural outputs and adopt a flexible strategy to optimize the
diffusion reasoner's policy. We evaluate our methodology on some classical
symbolic reasoning benchmarks, including Sudoku, Maze, pathfinding and
preference learning. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach
achieves outstanding accuracy and logical consistency among neural networks.

Motivation: 大型语言模型虽然性能优异，但模型规模过大带来了部署、扩展和能效方面的挑战。现有剪枝方法要么导致性能显著下降，要么需要计算成本高昂的微调。

Method: Z-Pruner利用权重更新幅度和激活模式来识别和消除冗余参数，是一种模型无关、高效且易于实现的后训练剪枝方法，无需任何重新训练。

Result: 在LLaMA-2、LLaMA-3和OPT等多种LLM架构上的实验表明，Z-Pruner在标准语言基准测试中超越了需要密集权重更新的最先进方法，获得了最低的困惑度分数和最高的零样本准确率平均分。

Conclusion: Z-Pruner提供了一种有效的后训练剪枝解决方案，能够在保持性能的同时显著减少模型大小和推理延迟，且无需重新训练过程。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have rapidly advanced in recent years, achieving
remarkable performance across a wide range of natural language processing
tasks. However, this progress has come at the cost of increasingly large model
sizes, which pose significant challenges for deployment, scalability, and
energy efficiency. To address these limitations, post-training pruning has
emerged as a promising approach for reducing model size and inference latency
without the need for retraining. Despite these advantages, many existing
pruning methods result in substantial performance degradation or require
computationally expensive fine-tuning. In this work, we introduce Z-Pruner, a
novel post-training pruning method designed to induce sparsity in pretrained
LLMs without any retraining. Unlike conventional approaches, Z-Pruner leverages
both weight update magnitudes and activation patterns to identify and eliminate
redundant parameters more effectively. Our method is model-agnostic, efficient,
and easy to implement. We evaluate Z-Pruner using multiple widely-used LLM
architectures, including LLaMA-2, LLaMA-3, and OPT, across a diverse set of
standard language benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate that Z-Pruner
surpasses state-of-the-art pruning methods that require intensive weight
updates. Specifically, Z-Pruner achieves the lowest perplexity scores and the
highest overall average score for zero-shot accuracy. We have made the
corresponding codes publicly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决多模态情感分析中深度、动态和可解释的融合问题，同时保持参数效率，适用于资源受限的场景。

Method: 提出渐进式层内融合范式（跨注意力机制）、自适应门控仲裁机制（动态控制器）和混合参数高效微调策略（LoRA+后融合适配器）。

Result: 在MOSI数据集上达到MAE 0.691和F1-Score 86.9%的SOTA性能，仅使用3.09M可训练参数。

Conclusion: PGF-Net通过创新的融合机制和参数效率策略，实现了高性能、高效率的多模态情感分析，在性能和计算效率之间取得了优越平衡。

Abstract: We introduce PGF-Net (Progressive Gated-Fusion Network), a novel deep
learning framework designed for efficient and interpretable multimodal
sentiment analysis. Our framework incorporates three primary innovations.
Firstly, we propose a Progressive Intra-Layer Fusion paradigm, where a
Cross-Attention mechanism empowers the textual representation to dynamically
query and integrate non-linguistic features from audio and visual streams
within the deep layers of a Transformer encoder. This enables a deeper,
context-dependent fusion process. Secondly, the model incorporates an Adaptive
Gated Arbitration mechanism, which acts as a dynamic controller to balance the
original linguistic information against the newly fused multimodal context,
ensuring stable and meaningful integration while preventing noise from
overwhelming the signal. Lastly, a hybrid Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning
(PEFT) strategy is employed, synergistically combining global adaptation via
LoRA with local refinement through Post-Fusion Adapters. This significantly
reduces trainable parameters, making the model lightweight and suitable for
resource-limited scenarios. These innovations are integrated into a
hierarchical encoder architecture, enabling PGF-Net to perform deep, dynamic,
and interpretable multimodal sentiment analysis while maintaining exceptional
parameter efficiency. Experimental results on MOSI dataset demonstrate that our
proposed PGF-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance, with a Mean Absolute
Error (MAE) of 0.691 and an F1-Score of 86.9%. Notably, our model achieves
these results with only 3.09M trainable parameters, showcasing a superior
balance between performance and computational efficiency.

Conclusion: 简化架构不仅提高了计算效率，还提供了精确的ECG信号分割，是心脏信号监测的实用有效解决方案。

Abstract: The heart's electrical activity, recorded through Electrocardiography (ECG),
is essential for diagnosing various cardiovascular conditions. However, many
existing ECG segmentation models rely on complex, multi-layered architectures
such as BiLSTM, which are computationally intensive and inefficient. This study
introduces a streamlined architecture that combines spectral analysis with
probabilistic predictions for ECG signal segmentation. By replacing complex
layers with simpler ones, the model effectively captures both temporal and
spectral features of the P, QRS, and T waves. Additionally, an Explainable AI
(XAI) approach is applied to enhance model interpretability by explaining how
temporal and frequency-based features contribute to ECG segmentation. By
incorporating principles from physics-based AI, this method provides a clear
understanding of the decision-making process, ensuring reliability and
transparency in ECG analysis. This approach achieves high segmentation
accuracy: 97.00% for the QRS wave, 93.33% for the T wave, and 96.07% for the P
wave. These results indicate that the simplified architecture not only improves
computational efficiency but also provides precise segmentation, making it a
practical and effective solution for heart signal monitoring.

TL;DR: TPLA是一种针对张量并行环境的潜在注意力优化方案，通过分区潜在表示和注意力头输入维度，在保持压缩KV缓存优势的同时实现高效的张量并行计算。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在张量并行(TP)环境中，多头潜在注意力(MLA)需要每个设备加载完整缓存，丧失了压缩KV缓存的优势。需要一种既能保持MLA压缩特性又能适应TP架构的方案。

Method: 提出TPLA方案：将潜在表示和每个注意力头的输入维度分区到不同设备，各设备独立计算注意力后通过all-reduce合并结果。使用正交变换（如Hadamard变换或PCA）减少分区间干扰。

Result: 在DeepSeek-V3和Kimi-K2模型上，32K上下文长度下分别实现1.79倍和1.93倍加速，同时在常识推理和长文本基准测试中保持性能。

Conclusion: TPLA成功解决了MLA在TP环境中的效率问题，实现了压缩KV缓存与张量并行效率的双重优势，且与FlashAttention-3兼容，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Multi-Head Latent Attention (MLA), introduced in DeepSeek-V2, compresses
key-value states into a low-rank latent vector, caching only this vector to
reduce memory. In tensor parallelism (TP), however, attention heads are
computed across multiple devices, and each device must load the full cache,
eroding the advantage of MLA over Grouped Query Attention (GQA). We propose
Tensor-Parallel Latent Attention (TPLA): a scheme that partitions both the
latent representation and each head's input dimension across devices, performs
attention independently per shard, and then combines results with an
all-reduce. TPLA preserves the benefits of a compressed KV cache while
unlocking TP efficiency. Unlike Grouped Latent Attention (GLA), every head in
TPLA still leverages the full latent representation, maintaining stronger
representational capacity. TPLA is drop-in compatible with models pre-trained
using MLA: it supports MLA-style prefilling and enables efficient
tensor-parallel decoding without retraining. Applying simple orthogonal
transforms -- e.g., the Hadamard transform or PCA -- before TP slicing further
mitigates cross-shard interference, yielding minimal accuracy degradation. By
reducing the per-device KV cache for DeepSeek-V3 and Kimi-K2, we achieve 1.79x
and 1.93x speedups, respectively, at a 32K-token context length while
maintaining performance on commonsense and LongBench benchmarks. TPLA can be
implemented with FlashAttention-3, enabling practical end-to-end acceleration.

Abstract: We introduce a novel framework for temporal causal discovery and inference
that addresses two key challenges: complex nonlinear dependencies and spurious
correlations. Our approach employs a multi-layer Transformer-based time-series
forecaster to capture long-range, nonlinear temporal relationships among
variables. After training, we extract the underlying causal structure and
associated time lags from the forecaster using gradient-based analysis,
enabling the construction of a causal graph. To mitigate the impact of spurious
causal relationships, we introduce a prior knowledge integration mechanism
based on attention masking, which consistently enforces user-excluded causal
links across multiple Transformer layers. Extensive experiments show that our
method significantly outperforms other state-of-the-art approaches, achieving a
12.8% improvement in F1-score for causal discovery and 98.9% accuracy in
estimating causal lags.

Abstract: Large collections of high-dimensional data have become nearly ubiquitous
across many academic fields and application domains, ranging from biology to
the humanities. Since working directly with high-dimensional data poses
challenges, the demand for algorithms that create low-dimensional
representations, or embeddings, for data visualization, exploration, and
analysis is now greater than ever. In recent years, numerous embedding
algorithms have been developed, and their usage has become widespread in
research and industry. This surge of interest has resulted in a large and
fragmented research field that faces technical challenges alongside fundamental
debates, and it has left practitioners without clear guidance on how to
effectively employ existing methods. Aiming to increase coherence and
facilitate future work, in this review we provide a detailed and critical
overview of recent developments, derive a list of best practices for creating
and using low-dimensional embeddings, evaluate popular approaches on a variety
of datasets, and discuss the remaining challenges and open problems in the

Abstract: Hybridizing machine learning techniques with metaheuristics has attracted
significant attention in recent years. Many attempts employ supervised or
reinforcement learning to support the decision-making of heuristic methods.
However, in some cases, these techniques are deemed too time-consuming and not
competitive with hand-crafted heuristics. This paper proposes a hybridization
between metaheuristics and a less expensive learning strategy to extract the
latent structure of graphs, known as Graph Representation Learning (GRL). For
such, we approach the Constrained Incremental Graph Drawing Problem (C-IGDP), a
hierarchical graph visualization problem. There is limited literature on
methods for this problem, for which Greedy Randomized Search Procedures (GRASP)
heuristics have shown promising results. In line with this, this paper
investigates the gains of incorporating GRL into the construction phase of
GRASP, which we refer to as Graph Learning GRASP (GL-GRASP). In computational
experiments, we first analyze the results achieved considering different node
embedding techniques, where deep learning-based strategies stood out. The
evaluation considered the primal integral measure that assesses the quality of
the solutions according to the required time for such. According to this
measure, the best GL-GRASP heuristics demonstrated superior performance than
state-of-the-art literature GRASP heuristics for the problem. A scalability
test on newly generated denser instances under a fixed time limit further
confirmed the robustness of the GL-GRASP heuristics.

monitoring wheel flange wear depth, utilizing displacement and temperature
sensors. Laboratory experiments are conducted to emulate wheel flange wear
depth and surrounding temperature fluctuations in different periods of time.
Employing collected data, the training of machine learning algorithms that are
based on regression models, is dynamically automated. Further experimentation
results, using standards procedures, validate the system's efficacy. To enhance
accuracy, an infinite impulse response filter (IIR) that mitigates vehicle
dynamics and sensor noise is designed. Filter parameters were computed based on
specifications derived from a Fast Fourier Transform analysis of locomotive
simulations and emulation experiments data. The results show that the dynamic
machine learning algorithm effectively counter sensor nonlinear response to
temperature effects, achieving an accuracy of 96.5 %, with a minimal runtime.
The real-time noise reduction via IIR filter enhances the accuracy up to 98.2
%. Integrated with railway communication embedded systems such as Internet of
Things devices, this advanced monitoring system offers unparalleled real-time
insights into wheel flange wear and track irregular conditions that cause it,
ensuring heightened safety and efficiency in railway systems operations.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种在奖励向量按偏好锥排序的分布偏移情境下的上下文赌博机学习算法，通过自适应离散化和乐观消除策略来自动调整分布偏移，并引入了基于偏好的遗憾概念来衡量性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究在存在分布偏移的情况下，如何设计能够自适应调整的上下文赌博机学习算法，特别是在奖励向量具有偏好排序结构时。

Method: 提出基于自适应离散化和乐观消除的策略，该策略能够自我调整以适应底层分布偏移。引入了基于偏好的遗憾概念来评估策略性能，该遗憾通过帕累托前沿之间的距离来衡量。

Result: 建立了在各种分布偏移假设下的遗憾上界，这些界限推广了无分布偏移和向量奖励设置的现有结果，并在存在分布偏移时能够优雅地随问题参数扩展。

Conclusion: 所提出的策略在分布偏移环境下表现良好，遗憾界限具有良好的扩展性，为处理有序奖励向量的分布偏移问题提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: We consider contextual bandit learning under distribution shift when reward
vectors are ordered according to a given preference cone. We propose an
adaptive-discretization and optimistic elimination based policy that self-tunes
to the underlying distribution shift. To measure the performance of this
policy, we introduce the notion of preference-based regret which measures the
performance of a policy in terms of distance between Pareto fronts. We study
the performance of this policy by establishing upper bounds on its regret under
various assumptions on the nature of distribution shift. Our regret bounds
generalize known results for the existing case of no distribution shift and
vectorial reward settings, and scale gracefully with problem parameters in
presence of distribution shifts.

Motivation: 平衡传播(EP)作为一种生物启发的局部学习规则，虽然计算效率高且与BPTT梯度对齐，但先前研究仅限于浅层架构，深层网络存在梯度消失问题，导致能量最小化和梯度计算收敛困难。

Method: 提出新颖的EP框架，引入中间误差信号来增强信息流和神经元动力学的收敛性，首次将知识蒸馏和局部误差信号整合到EP方法中。

Result: 在CIFAR-10和CIFAR-100数据集上实现了最先进的性能，展示了在深度VGG架构上的可扩展性。

Conclusion: 这项工作显著推进了EP方法的可扩展性，为其在现实世界系统中的应用铺平了道路。

Abstract: Equilibrium Propagation (EP) is a biologically inspired local learning rule
first proposed for convergent recurrent neural networks (CRNNs), in which
synaptic updates depend only on neuron states from two distinct phases. EP
estimates gradients that closely align with those computed by Backpropagation
Through Time (BPTT) while significantly reducing computational demands,
positioning it as a potential candidate for on-chip training in neuromorphic
architectures. However, prior studies on EP have been constrained to shallow
architectures, as deeper networks suffer from the vanishing gradient problem,
leading to convergence difficulties in both energy minimization and gradient
computation. To address the vanishing gradient problem in deep EP networks, we
propose a novel EP framework that incorporates intermediate error signals to
enhance information flow and convergence of neuron dynamics. This is the first
work to integrate knowledge distillation and local error signals into EP,
enabling the training of significantly deeper architectures. Our proposed
approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on the CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100
datasets, showcasing its scalability on deep VGG architectures. These results
represent a significant advancement in the scalability of EP, paving the way
for its application in real-world systems.

Abstract: In this paper, we continue the development of the Cartan neural networks
programme, launched with three previous publications, by focusing on some
mathematical foundational aspects that we deem necessary for our next steps
forward. The mathematical and conceptual results are diverse and span various
mathematical fields, but the inspiring motivation is unified. The aim is to
introduce layers that are mathematically modeled as non-compact symmetric
spaces, each mapped onto the next one by solvable group homomorphisms. In
particular, in the spirit of Convolutional neural networks, we have introduced
the notion of Tits Satake (TS) vector bundles where the TS submanifold is the
base space. Within this framework, the tiling of the base manifold, the
representation of bundle sections using harmonics, and the need for a general
theory of separator walls motivated a series of mathematical investigations
that produced both definite and partial results. Specifically, we present the
group theoretical construction of the separators for all non-compact symmetric
spaces $\mathrm{U/H}$, as well as of the $\Delta_{8,3,2}$ tiling group and its
normal Fuchsian subgroups, respectively yielding the uniformization of the
genus $g=3$ Fermat Quartic and of the genus $g=2$ Bolza surface. The quotient
automorphic groups are studied. Furthermore, we found a new representation of
the Laplacian Green function and the Heat Kernel on Hyperbolic Spaces
$\mathbb{H}^{n}$, and a setup for the construction of the harmonic functions in
terms of the spinor representation of pseudo-orthogonal groups. Finally, to
obtain an explicit construction of the Laplacian eigenfunctions on the Bolza
Riemann surface, we propose and conjecture a new strategy relying on the
Abel-Jacobi map of the Riemann surface to its Jacobian variety and the Siegel
Theta function.

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) in multi-service provider (SP) ecosystems is
fundamentally hampered by non-cooperative dynamics, where privacy constraints
and competing interests preclude the centralized optimization of multi-SP
communication and computation resources. In this paper, we introduce PAC-MCoFL,
a game-theoretic multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework where SPs
act as agents to jointly optimize client assignment, adaptive quantization, and
resource allocation. Within the framework, we integrate Pareto Actor-Critic
(PAC) principles with expectile regression, enabling agents to conjecture
optimal joint policies to achieve Pareto-optimal equilibria while modeling
heterogeneous risk profiles. To manage the high-dimensional action space, we
devise a ternary Cartesian decomposition (TCAD) mechanism that facilitates
fine-grained control. Further, we develop PAC-MCoFL-p, a scalable variant
featuring a parameterized conjecture generator that substantially reduces
computational complexity with a provably bounded error. Alongside theoretical
convergence guarantees, our framework's superiority is validated through
extensive simulations -- PAC-MCoFL achieves approximately 5.8% and 4.2%
improvements in total reward and hypervolume indicator (HVI), respectively,
over the latest MARL solutions. The results also demonstrate that our method
can more effectively balance individual SP and system performance in scaled
deployments and under diverse data heterogeneity.

Conclusion: 这篇论文为时间分布潮流条件下的判别分析建立了一个统一且数据高效的基础框架，有效解决了分布潮流带来的挑战。

Abstract: Classical discriminant analysis assumes identically distributed training
data, yet in many applications observations are collected over time and the
class-conditional distributions drift. This population drift renders stationary
classifiers unreliable. We propose a principled, model-based framework that
embeds discriminant analysis within state-space models to obtain nonstationary
linear discriminant analysis (NSLDA) and nonstationary quadratic discriminant
analysis (NSQDA). For linear-Gaussian dynamics, we adapt Kalman smoothing to
handle multiple samples per time step and develop two practical extensions: (i)
an expectation-maximization (EM) approach that jointly estimates unknown system
parameters, and (ii) a Gaussian mixture model (GMM)-Kalman method that
simultaneously recovers unobserved time labels and parameters, a scenario
common in practice. To address nonlinear or non-Gaussian drift, we employ
particle smoothing to estimate time-varying class centroids, yielding fully
nonstationary discriminant rules. Extensive simulations demonstrate consistent
improvements over stationary linear discriminant analysis (LDA), quadratic
discriminant analysis (QDA), and support vector machine (SVM) baselines, with
robustness to noise, missing data, and class imbalance. This paper establishes
a unified and data-efficient foundation for discriminant analysis under
temporal distribution shift.

Conclusion: 任务算术可重新理解为近似多任务学习形式，为其有效性提供了明确的理论依据，并强调了早期训练动态在模型合并中的关键作用

Abstract: Task arithmetic has emerged as a simple yet powerful technique for model
merging, enabling the combination of multiple finetuned models into one.
Despite its empirical success, a clear theoretical explanation of why and when
it works is lacking. This paper provides a rigorous theoretical foundation for
task arithmetic by establishing a connection between task vectors and gradients
of the task losses. We show that under standard gradient descent, a task vector
generated from one epoch of finetuning is exactly equivalent to the negative
gradient of the loss, scaled by the learning rate. For the practical
multi-epoch setting, we prove that this equivalence holds approximately, with a
second-order error term that we explicitly bound for feed-forward networks. Our
empirical analysis across seven vision benchmarks corroborates our theory,
demonstrating that the first-epoch gradient dominates the finetuning trajectory
in both norm and direction. A key implication is that merging models finetuned
for only a single epoch often yields performance comparable to merging fully
converged models. These findings reframe task arithmetic as a form of
approximate multitask learning, providing a clear rationale for its
effectiveness and highlighting the critical role of early training dynamics in
model merging.

Conclusion: 该方法能够演化出有效、人类可理解且易于部署的交通信号控制策略

Abstract: Recently, learning-based approaches, have achieved significant success in
automatically devising effective traffic signal control strategies. In
particular, as a powerful evolutionary machine learning approach, Genetic
Programming (GP) is utilized to evolve human-understandable phase urgency
functions to measure the urgency of activating a green light for a specific
phase. However, current GP-based methods are unable to treat the common traffic
features of different traffic signal phases consistently. To address this
issue, we propose to use a symmetric phase urgency function to calculate the
phase urgency for a specific phase based on the current road conditions. This
is represented as an aggregation of two shared subtrees, each representing the
urgency of a turn movement in the phase. We then propose a GP method to evolve
the symmetric phase urgency function. We evaluate our proposed method on the
well-known cityflow traffic simulator, based on multiple public real-world
datasets. The experimental results show that the proposed symmetric urgency
function representation can significantly improve the performance of the
learned traffic signal control policies over the traditional GP representation
on a wide range of scenarios. Further analysis shows that the proposed method
can evolve effective, human-understandable and easily deployable traffic signal
control policies.

Abstract: This paper claims that machine learning models deployed in high stakes
domains such as medicine must be interpretable, shareable, reproducible and
accountable. We argue that these principles should form the foundational design
criteria for machine learning algorithms dealing with critical medical data,
including survival analysis and risk prediction tasks. Black box models, while
often highly accurate, struggle to gain trust and regulatory approval in health
care due to a lack of transparency. We discuss how intrinsically interpretable
modeling approaches (such as kernel methods with sparsity, prototype-based
learning, and deep kernel models) can serve as powerful alternatives to opaque
deep networks, providing insight into biomedical predictions. We then examine
accountability in model development, calling for rigorous evaluation, fairness,
and uncertainty quantification to ensure models reliably support clinical
decisions. Finally, we explore how generative AI and collaborative learning
paradigms (such as federated learning and diffusion-based data synthesis)
enable reproducible research and cross-institutional integration of
heterogeneous biomedical data without compromising privacy, hence shareability.
By rethinking machine learning foundations along these axes, we can develop
medical AI that is not only accurate but also transparent, trustworthy, and
translatable to real-world clinical settings.

TL;DR: CommonKV是一种无需训练的跨层KV缓存压缩方法，通过相邻参数共享和SVD分解来减少LLM内存占用，在多种压缩比下优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型的KV缓存随序列长度增长而急剧增加内存消耗，现有跨层共享方法要么需要修改架构重新训练，要么在高压缩率下性能显著下降。

Method: 利用SVD实现相邻层参数权重共享，创建更易合并的潜在KV缓存，并引入基于余弦相似度的自适应预算分配策略来避免过度压缩不相似的缓存。

Result: 在多个骨干模型和基准测试中，CommonKV在各种压缩比下始终优于现有的低秩和跨层方法，并能与其他量化和驱逐方法正交结合。

Conclusion: CommonKV实现了高达98%的压缩率而无显著性能损失，为LLM内存优化提供了有效的训练免费解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) confront significant memory challenges due to
the escalating KV cache with increasing sequence length. As a crucial
technique, existing cross-layer KV cache sharing methods either necessitate
modified model architectures with subsequent pre-training or incur significant
performance degradation at high compression rates. To mitigate these
challenges, we propose CommonKV, a training-free method for cross-layer KV
cache compression through adjacent parameters sharing. Inspired by the high
similarity observed in cross-layer hidden states, we utilize Singular Value
Decomposition (SVD) to achieve weight sharing across adjacent parameters,
resulting in a more easily mergeable latent KV cache. Furthermore, we also
introduce an adaptive budget allocation strategy. It dynamically assigns
compression budgets based on cosine similarity, ensuring that dissimilar caches
are not over-compressed. Experiments across multiple backbone models and
benchmarks including LongBench and Ruler demonstrate that the proposed method
consistently outperforms existing low-rank and cross-layer approaches at
various compression ratios. Moreover, we find that the benefits of CommonKV are
orthogonal to other quantization and eviction methods. By integrating these
approaches, we can ultimately achieve a 98\% compression ratio without
significant performance loss.

Abstract: Micromobility systems, which include lightweight and low-speed vehicles such
as bicycles, e-bikes, and e-scooters, have become an important part of urban
transportation and are used to solve problems such as traffic congestion, air
pollution, and high transportation costs. Successful utilisation of

Conclusion: 该方法为开发能够持续实时学习的通用大语言模型代理提供了可扩展和高效的途径，推动机器学习向开放式技能获取和深度研究场景发展

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel learning paradigm for adaptive Large
Language Model (LLM) agents that eliminates the need for fine-tuning the
underlying LLMs. Existing approaches are often either rigid, relying on static,
handcrafted reflection workflows, or computationally intensive, requiring
gradient updates of LLM model parameters. In contrast, our method enables
low-cost continual adaptation via memory-based online reinforcement learning.
We formalise this as a Memory-augmented Markov Decision Process (M-MDP),
equipped with a neural case-selection policy to guide action decisions. Past
experiences are stored in an episodic memory, either differentiable or
non-parametric. The policy is continually updated based on environmental
feedback through a memory rewriting mechanism, whereas policy improvement is
achieved through efficient memory reading (retrieval). We instantiate our agent
model in the deep research setting, namely AgentFly, which attains top-1 on
GAIA validation ($87.88\%$ Pass@$3$) and $79.40\%$ on the test set. It reaches
$66.6\%$ F1 and $80.4\%$ PM on the DeepResearcher dataset, outperforming the
state-of-the-art training-based method, while case-based memory adds $4.7\%$ to
$9.6\%$ absolute points on out-of-distribution tasks. Our approach offers a
scalable and efficient pathway for developing generalist LLM agents capable of
continuous, real-time learning without gradient updates, advancing machine
learning towards open-ended skill acquisition and deep research scenarios. The

Motivation: 尽管确定性采样器在扩散模型中广泛应用，但其潜在局限性尚未被充分探索。本文旨在识别和分析ODE扩散采样中先前未被认识的崩溃错误现象。

Method: 引入新的度量指标来量化崩溃错误，通过实证研究观察see-saw效应，并应用现有的采样、训练和架构技术来验证对崩溃错误的解释。

Result: 研究发现崩溃错误在各种设置中普遍存在，低噪声区域的得分学习会对高噪声区域的得分学习产生负面影响，这种不匹配与确定性采样器的动态特性共同导致了崩溃错误。

Abstract: Despite the widespread adoption of deterministic samplers in diffusion models
(DMs), their potential limitations remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we
identify collapse errors, a previously unrecognized phenomenon in ODE-based
diffusion sampling, where the sampled data is overly concentrated in local data
space. To quantify this effect, we introduce a novel metric and demonstrate
that collapse errors occur across a variety of settings. When investigating its
underlying causes, we observe a see-saw effect, where score learning in low
noise regimes adversely impacts the one in high noise regimes. This misfitting
in high noise regimes, coupled with the dynamics of deterministic samplers,
ultimately causes collapse errors. Guided by these insights, we apply existing
techniques from sampling, training, and architecture to empirically support our
explanation of collapse errors. This work provides intensive empirical evidence
of collapse errors in ODE-based diffusion sampling, emphasizing the need for
further research into the interplay between score learning and deterministic
sampling, an overlooked yet fundamental aspect of diffusion models.

TL;DR: STA-GANN是一个新颖的图神经网络框架，通过解耦相位模块、动态数据驱动的元数据图建模和对抗迁移学习策略，有效解决了时空克里金任务中数据不完整和模式泛化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前模型在时空克里金任务中难以确保推断模式的准确性和泛化能力，特别是在处理动态空间依赖性和时间偏移方面存在局限，需要新的方法来提升未知传感器的泛化性能。

Method: 提出STA-GANN框架，包含三个核心组件：(1)解耦相位模块检测和调整时间戳偏移；(2)动态数据驱动的元数据图建模利用时序数据和元数据更新空间关系；(3)对抗迁移学习策略确保模型泛化能力。

Result: 在来自四个领域的九个数据集上进行广泛验证，理论和实验证据均表明STA-GANN具有优越的性能表现。

Conclusion: STA-GANN通过创新的图神经网络架构和对抗学习策略，显著提升了时空克里金任务的模式有效性和泛化能力，为解决不完整时空数据推断问题提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Spatio-temporal tasks often encounter incomplete data arising from missing or
inaccessible sensors, making spatio-temporal kriging crucial for inferring the
completely missing temporal information. However, current models struggle with
ensuring the validity and generalizability of inferred spatio-temporal
patterns, especially in capturing dynamic spatial dependencies and temporal
shifts, and optimizing the generalizability of unknown sensors. To overcome
these limitations, we propose Spatio-Temporal Aware Graph Adversarial Neural
Network (STA-GANN), a novel GNN-based kriging framework that improves
spatio-temporal pattern validity and generalization. STA-GANN integrates (i)
Decoupled Phase Module that senses and adjusts for timestamp shifts. (ii)
Dynamic Data-Driven Metadata Graph Modeling to update spatial relationships
using temporal data and metadata; (iii) An adversarial transfer learning
strategy to ensure generalizability. Extensive validation across nine datasets
from four fields and theoretical evidence both demonstrate the superior
performance of STA-GANN.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SPL-LNS是一种采样增强的神经大邻域搜索求解器，通过局部信息提案和事后重标记方法，有效解决整数线性规划问题，显著超越现有神经LNS求解器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于神经网络的LNS求解器采用贪婪策略预测局部最优解，存在陷入局部最优和样本效率低的问题，需要改进其搜索策略和训练效率。

Method: 将LNS建模为随机过程，提出SPL-LNS求解器，利用局部信息提案逃离局部最优，并开发新颖的事后重标记方法在自生成数据上高效训练。

Result: 实验结果表明，SPL-LNS在不同规模的各类整数线性规划问题上显著优于先前的神经LNS求解器。

Conclusion: SPL-LNS通过采样增强和高效训练方法，成功解决了神经LNS求解器的局部最优和样本效率问题，为组合优化提供了更有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Large Neighborhood Search (LNS) is a common heuristic in combinatorial
optimization that iteratively searches over a large neighborhood of the current
solution for a better one. Recently, neural network-based LNS solvers have
achieved great success in solving Integer Linear Programs (ILPs) by learning to
greedily predict the locally optimal solution for the next neighborhood
proposal. However, this greedy approach raises two key concerns: (1) to what
extent this greedy proposal suffers from local optima, and (2) how can we
effectively improve its sample efficiency in the long run. To address these
questions, this paper first formulates LNS as a stochastic process, and then
introduces SPL-LNS, a sampling-enhanced neural LNS solver that leverages
locally-informed proposals to escape local optima. We also develop a novel
hindsight relabeling method to efficiently train SPL-LNS on self-generated
data. Experimental results demonstrate that SPL-LNS substantially surpasses
prior neural LNS solvers for various ILP problems of different sizes.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于MiniRocket特征提取和线性分类器的MI-EEG分类方法，在PhysioNet数据集上达到98.63%的准确率，优于深度学习模型且计算成本更低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决MI-EEG信号分类面临的挑战，包括非平稳性、时变性和个体差异性，以及多类别分类准确率低的问题。

Method: 使用MiniRocket进行高效特征提取，然后用线性分类器进行分类；同时提出CNN-LSTM深度学习模型作为基线进行比较。

Result: 在PhysioNet数据集上，MiniRocket方法达到98.63%的平均准确率，CNN-LSTM达到98.06%，均表现出优异性能。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法显著提高了MI-EEG分类准确率，为特征提取和分类提供了新的见解，且计算成本更低。

Abstract: The brain-computer interface (BCI) establishes a non-muscle channel that
enables direct communication between the human body and an external device.
Electroencephalography (EEG) is a popular non-invasive technique for recording
brain signals. It is critical to process and comprehend the hidden patterns
linked to a specific cognitive or motor task, for instance, measured through
the motor imagery brain-computer interface (MI-BCI). A significant challenge is
presented by classifying motor imagery-based electroencephalogram (MI-EEG)
tasks, given that EEG signals exhibit nonstationarity, time-variance, and
individual diversity. Obtaining good classification accuracy is also very
difficult due to the growing number of classes and the natural variability
among individuals. To overcome these issues, this paper proposes a novel method
for classifying EEG motor imagery signals that extracts features efficiently
with Minimally Random Convolutional Kernel Transform (MiniRocket), a linear
classifier then uses the extracted features for activity recognition.
Furthermore, a novel deep learning based on Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) architecture to serve as a baseline was
proposed and demonstrated that classification via MiniRocket's features
achieves higher performance than the best deep learning models at lower
computational cost. The PhysioNet dataset was used to evaluate the performance
of the proposed approaches. The proposed models achieved mean accuracy values
of 98.63% and 98.06% for the MiniRocket and CNN-LSTM, respectively. The
findings demonstrate that the proposed approach can significantly enhance motor
imagery EEG accuracy and provide new insights into the feature extraction and
classification of MI-EEG.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GEM是一种参数规模感知的稀疏微调框架，通过梯度-权重比和熵引导掩码来最大化参数相对尺度的更新，在仅更新0.1%参数的情况下，微调准确率比全参数微调提升1.6%


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有PEFT方法只更新少量参数但忽略参数原始尺度，导致模型行为变化有限。需要一种能考虑参数相对尺度重要性的方法

Method: 提出GEM框架：1) 使用梯度-权重比选择更新显著的参数；2) 基于参数值熵自适应确定每层需要微调的参数数量

Result: 在GLUE、SuperGLUE、GSM8k和MBPP等任务上验证，仅更新0.1%参数即可达到比全参数微调高1.6%的准确率

Conclusion: GEM通过参数规模感知和分布敏感的稀疏微调，有效利用计算预算，实现了更高效的下游任务适应

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) has become a popular way to adapt
large pre-trained models to new tasks. Most PEFT methods update only a small
subset of parameters while freezing the rest, avoiding redundant computation.
As they maximize the absolute size of the updates without regard to the
parameters' original scale, the resulting changes in model behavior can be
minimal. In contrast, we maximize updates relative to each parameter's scale,
yielding more meaningful downstream adaptation. We propose Gradient-to-Weight
Ratio and Entropy-guided Masking (GEM), a parameter scale-aware,
distribution-sensitive sparse fine-tuning framework. GEM prioritizes parameters
whose updates are significant in proportion to their initial pre-trained
values. It also adaptively determines how many parameters to tune at each layer
based on the entropy of parameter values, thereby making the most effective use
of the computational budget in PEFT. Our empirical study demonstrates the
efficacy of GEM on both general-domain tasks (GLUE and SuperGLUE) and
domain-specific tasks (GSM8k and MBPP), achieving up to a 1.6% improvement in
fine-tuning accuracy over full fine-tuning while updating only 0.1% of model
parameters.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: UMATO是一种改进的降维技术，通过两阶段优化过程同时保留数据的局部和全局结构特征，在全局结构保持方面优于UMAP等现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有降维技术要么专注于保持局部邻域结构，要么专注于保持全局距离结构，但都无法同时有效保留所有结构特征，可能导致分析得出错误结论。

Method: UMATO将UMAP的优化过程分为两个阶段：第一阶段使用代表性点构建骨架布局，第二阶段在保持区域特征的同时投影剩余点。

Result: 定量实验表明UMATO在全局结构保持方面优于包括UMAP在内的广泛使用的降维技术，同时在局部结构方面仅有轻微损失。该方法在可扩展性和对初始化及子采样的稳定性方面也优于基线技术。

Conclusion: UMATO通过两阶段优化有效解决了降维中局部和全局结构平衡的问题，提高了高维数据可视化分析的可靠性。

Abstract: Due to the intrinsic complexity of high-dimensional (HD) data, dimensionality
reduction (DR) techniques cannot preserve all the structural characteristics of
the original data. Therefore, DR techniques focus on preserving either local
neighborhood structures (local techniques) or global structures such as
pairwise distances between points (global techniques). However, both approaches
can mislead analysts to erroneous conclusions about the overall arrangement of
manifolds in HD data. For example, local techniques may exaggerate the
compactness of individual manifolds, while global techniques may fail to
separate clusters that are well-separated in the original space. In this
research, we provide a deeper insight into Uniform Manifold Approximation with
Two-phase Optimization (UMATO), a DR technique that addresses this problem by
effectively capturing local and global structures. UMATO achieves this by
dividing the optimization process of UMAP into two phases. In the first phase,
it constructs a skeletal layout using representative points, and in the second
phase, it projects the remaining points while preserving the regional
characteristics. Quantitative experiments validate that UMATO outperforms
widely used DR techniques, including UMAP, in terms of global structure
preservation, with a slight loss in local structure. We also confirm that UMATO
outperforms baseline techniques in terms of scalability and stability against
initialization and subsampling, making it more effective for reliable HD data
analysis. Finally, we present a case study and a qualitative demonstration that
highlight UMATO's effectiveness in generating faithful projections, enhancing
the overall reliability of visual analytics using DR.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PIANO是一个基于自回归建模的物理信息神经网络框架，通过显式地将未来预测条件化于过去状态来解决时间相关PDE问题，显著提升了PINNs在动态系统中的准确性和稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的物理信息神经网络(PINNs)在求解时间相关偏微分方程时存在点对点预测的局限性，忽略了动态系统的自回归特性，导致不稳定性和预测不准确的问题。

Method: 提出了物理信息自回归网络(PIANO)框架，采用自回归操作方式，通过自监督展开机制进行训练，并在训练过程中强制实施物理约束。

Result: 理论分析证明PIANO通过自回归建模实现了稳定性，在具有挑战性的时间相关PDE实验中达到了最先进的性能，在天气预报任务中也优于现有方法。

Conclusion: PIANO通过重新设计PINNs框架，成功解决了时间相关PDE求解中的稳定性问题，为动态系统建模提供了更准确和稳定的解决方案。

Abstract: Solving time-dependent partial differential equations (PDEs) is fundamental
to modeling critical phenomena across science and engineering. Physics-Informed
Neural Networks (PINNs) solve PDEs using deep learning. However, PINNs perform
pointwise predictions that neglect the autoregressive property of dynamical
systems, leading to instabilities and inaccurate predictions. We introduce
Physics-Informed Autoregressive Networks (PIANO) -- a framework that redesigns
PINNs to model dynamical systems. PIANO operates autoregressively, explicitly
conditioning future predictions on the past. It is trained through a
self-supervised rollout mechanism while enforcing physical constraints. We
present a rigorous theoretical analysis demonstrating that PINNs suffer from
temporal instability, while PIANO achieves stability through autoregressive
modeling. Extensive experiments on challenging time-dependent PDEs demonstrate
that PIANO achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly improving
accuracy and stability over existing methods. We further show that PIANO
outperforms existing methods in weather forecasting.

Result: 发现不同疾病组在子频带的频谱模式存在差异，能够区分COPD与其他呼吸疾病，以及慢性与非慢性患者组

Conclusion: 该方法提供了咳嗽声学的病理生理学洞察，展示了频率分辨的XAI增强分析在生物医学信号解释和呼吸疾病诊断中的价值

Abstract: This paper presents an explainable artificial intelligence (XAI)-based
framework for the spectral analysis of cough sounds associated with chronic
respiratory diseases, with a particular focus on Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary
Disease (COPD). A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is trained on
time-frequency representations of cough signals, and occlusion maps are used to
identify diagnostically relevant regions within the spectrograms. These
highlighted areas are subsequently decomposed into five frequency subbands,
enabling targeted spectral feature extraction and analysis. The results reveal
that spectral patterns differ across subbands and disease groups, uncovering
complementary and compensatory trends across the frequency spectrum.
Noteworthy, the approach distinguishes COPD from other respiratory conditions,
and chronic from non-chronic patient groups, based on interpretable spectral
markers. These findings provide insight into the underlying pathophysiological
characteristics of cough acoustics and demonstrate the value of
frequency-resolved, XAI-enhanced analysis for biomedical signal interpretation
and translational respiratory disease diagnostics.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本研究比较了LSTM和Prophet模型在尼日利亚北部空气质量预测中的表现，发现Prophet在季节性数据中表现优异，而LSTM在突变数据中更好，挑战了深度学习模型必然更优的假设。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低资源地区空气质量数据不规律且稀缺，需要系统比较先进机器学习模型在此类约束下的性能，为资源受限环境提供合适的预测方法。

Method: 使用2018-2023年19个州的月度观测数据，评估LSTM网络和Facebook Prophet模型对多种污染物（CO、SO2、SO4）的预测能力。

Result: Prophet模型在季节性和长期趋势主导的时间序列中往往匹配或超越LSTM的准确性，而LSTM在具有突然结构变化的数据集中表现更好。

Conclusion: 研究结果支持在资源受限环境中采用上下文敏感、计算高效的预测方法，而不是盲目追求模型复杂性，强调了模型与数据对齐的重要性。

Abstract: Air pollution forecasting is critical for proactive environmental management,
yet data irregularities and scarcity remain major challenges in low-resource
regions. Northern Nigeria faces high levels of air pollutants, but few studies
have systematically compared the performance of advanced machine learning
models under such constraints. This study evaluates Long Short-Term Memory
(LSTM) networks and the Facebook Prophet model for forecasting multiple
pollutants (CO, SO2, SO4) using monthly observational data from 2018 to 2023
across 19 states. Results show that Prophet often matches or exceeds LSTM's
accuracy, particularly in series dominated by seasonal and long-term trends,
while LSTM performs better in datasets with abrupt structural changes. These
findings challenge the assumption that deep learning models inherently
outperform simpler approaches, highlighting the importance of model-data
alignment. For policymakers and practitioners in resource-constrained settings,
this work supports adopting context-sensitive, computationally efficient
forecasting methods over complexity for its own sake.

Abstract: Synthetic data generation, leveraging generative machine learning techniques,
offers a promising approach to mitigating privacy concerns associated with
real-world data usage. Synthetic data closely resembles real-world data while
maintaining strong privacy guarantees. However, a comprehensive assessment
framework is still missing in the evaluation of synthetic data generation,
especially when considering the balance between privacy preservation and data
utility in synthetic data. This research bridges this gap by proposing FEST, a
systematic framework for evaluating synthetic tabular data. FEST integrates
diverse privacy metrics (attack-based and distance-based), along with
similarity and machine learning utility metrics, to provide a holistic
assessment. We develop FEST as an open-source Python-based library and validate
it on multiple datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in analyzing the
privacy-utility trade-off of different synthetic data generation models. The
source code of FEST is available on Github.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着数据集规模和多样性增加，评估数据质量对机器学习分析至关重要。现有Data Shapley计算方法在大型数据集上面临计算复杂度高的问题，限制了实际应用

Method: 将数据集分块处理，使用优化子集选择和单次迭代随机梯度下降来估计每个数据块的贡献值，显著降低计算时间

Conclusion: 该方法使大规模表格数据集的质量评估变得实用，支持分类和回归流程，解决了现有Shapley近似方法的可扩展性问题

Abstract: As the volume and diversity of available datasets continue to increase,
assessing data quality has become crucial for reliable and efficient Machine
Learning analytics. A modern, game-theoretic approach for evaluating data
quality is the notion of Data Shapley which quantifies the value of individual
data points within a dataset. State-of-the-art methods to scale the NP-hard
Shapley computation also face severe challenges when applied to large-scale
datasets, limiting their practical use. In this work, we present a Data Shapley
approach to identify a dataset's high-quality data tuples, Chunked Data Shapley
(C-DaSh). C-DaSh scalably divides the dataset into manageable chunks and
estimates the contribution of each chunk using optimized subset selection and
single-iteration stochastic gradient descent. This approach drastically reduces
computation time while preserving high quality results. We empirically
benchmark our method on diverse real-world classification and regression tasks,
demonstrating that C-DaSh outperforms existing Shapley approximations in both
computational efficiency (achieving speedups between 80x - 2300x) and accuracy
in detecting low-quality data regions. Our method enables practical measurement
of dataset quality on large tabular datasets, supporting both classification
and regression pipelines.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables training models across decentralized data
silos while preserving client data privacy. Recent research has explored
efficient methods for post-training large language models (LLMs) within FL to
address computational and communication challenges. While existing approaches
often rely on access to LLMs' internal information, which is frequently
restricted in real-world scenarios, an inference-only paradigm (black-box
FedLLM) has emerged to address these limitations. This paper presents a
comprehensive survey on federated tuning for LLMs. We propose a taxonomy
categorizing existing studies along two axes: model access-based and parameter
efficiency-based optimization. We classify FedLLM approaches into white-box,
gray-box, and black-box techniques, highlighting representative methods within
each category. We review emerging research treating LLMs as black-box inference
APIs and discuss promising directions and open challenges for future research.

Conclusion: 学习到的辅助知识概念能够捕捉超越人工标注的概念结构，有效提升知识追踪和个性化推荐系统的性能

Abstract: Personalized recommendation is a key feature of intelligent tutoring systems,
typically relying on accurate models of student knowledge. Knowledge Tracing
(KT) models enable this by estimating a student's mastery based on their
historical interactions. Many KT models rely on human-annotated knowledge
concepts (KCs), which tag each exercise with one or more skills or concepts
believed to be necessary for solving it. However, these KCs can be incomplete,
error-prone, or overly general.
  In this paper, we propose a deep learning model that learns sparse binary
representations of exercises, where each bit indicates the presence or absence
of a latent concept. We refer to these representations as auxiliary KCs. These
representations capture conceptual structure beyond human-defined annotations
and are compatible with both classical models (e.g., BKT) and modern deep
learning KT architectures.
  We demonstrate that incorporating auxiliary KCs improves both student
modeling and adaptive exercise recommendation. For student modeling, we show
that augmenting classical models like BKT with auxiliary KCs leads to improved
predictive performance. For recommendation, we show that using auxiliary KCs
enhances both reinforcement learning-based policies and a simple planning-based
method (expectimax), resulting in measurable gains in student learning outcomes
within a simulated student environment.

Result: 实现了显著的加速效果，降低了计算成本，并展示了良好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: REFINE通过优化结构化反馈检索，有效提升了多模态推理的效率和性能，具有重要的应用潜力。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly
improved reasoning capabilities, with in-context learning (ICL) emerging as a
key technique for adaptation without retraining. While previous works have
focused on leveraging correct examples, recent research highlights the
importance of learning from errors to enhance performance. However, existing
methods lack a structured framework for analyzing and mitigating errors,
particularly in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), where integrating
visual and textual inputs adds complexity. To address this issue, we propose
REFINE: Retrieval-Enhanced Feedback via In-context Neural Error-book, a
teacher-student framework that systematically structures errors and provides
targeted feedback. REFINE introduces three systematic queries to construct
structured feedback -- Feed-Target, Feed-Check, and Feed-Path -- to enhance
multimodal reasoning by prioritizing relevant visual information, diagnosing
critical failure points, and formulating corrective actions. Unlike prior
approaches that rely on redundant retrievals, REFINE optimizes structured
feedback retrieval, improving inference efficiency, token usage, and
scalability. Our results demonstrate substantial speedup, reduced computational
costs, and successful generalization, highlighting REFINE's potential for
enhancing multimodal reasoning.

Abstract: This letter addresses essential aspects of threat assessment by proposing
intent-driven threat models that incorporate both capabilities and intents. We
propose a holistic framework for cyber physical awareness (CPA) in space
networks, pointing out that analyzing reliability and security separately can
lead to overfitting on system-specific criteria. We structure our proposed
framework in three main steps. First, we suggest an algorithm that extracts
characteristic properties of the received signal to facilitate an intuitive
understanding of potential threats. Second, we develop a multitask learning
architecture where one task evaluates reliability-related capabilities while
the other deciphers the underlying intentions of the signal. Finally, we
propose an adaptable threat assessment that aligns with varying security and
reliability requirements. The proposed framework enhances the robustness of
threat detection and assessment, outperforming conventional sequential methods,
and enables space networks with emerging intershell links to effectively
address complex threat scenarios.

translational and biomedical discovery. To address this limitation, we created
and curated eight comprehensive benchmark datasets comprising over 300,000
verifiable question-and-answer pairs, each targeting critical challenges in
drug discovery including target druggability, modality suitability, and drug
perturbation effects. Using this resource, we developed the OwkinZero models by
post-training open-source LLMs through a Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable
Rewards strategy. Our results demonstrate that specialized 8-32B OwkinZero
models substantially outperform larger, state-of-the-art commercial LLMs on
these biological benchmarks. Remarkably, we uncover evidence of a key aspect of
generalization: specialist models trained on a single task consistently
outperform their base models on previously unseen tasks. This generalization
effect is further amplified in our comprehensive OwkinZero models, which were
trained on a mixture of datasets and achieve even broader cross-task
improvements. This study represents a significant step toward addressing the
biological reasoning blind spot in current LLMs, demonstrating that targeted
reinforcement learning on carefully curated data can unlock generalizable
performance in specialized models, thereby accelerating AI-driven biological
discovery.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于LSTM-VAE的无监督在线学习框架，用于检测供水管网中的管道堵塞和背景泄漏故障，在非平稳条件下实现鲁棒检测和自适应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 供水管网对公共福祉和经济稳定至关重要，但面临管道堵塞和背景泄漏等挑战，这些挑战因数据非平稳性和标记数据有限等操作约束而加剧。

Method: 结合长短期记忆变分自编码器(LSTM-VAE)和双重漂移检测机制的无监督在线学习框架，管道堵塞建模为集体异常，背景泄漏建模为概念漂移。

Result: 在两个真实供水管网上的实验表明，该方法在检测异常和适应循环漂移方面持续优于强基线方法。

Conclusion: 该方法在动态供水管网环境中进行无监督事件检测方面表现出有效性，其轻量级、内存高效的设计支持实时边缘级监控。

Abstract: Water Distribution Networks (WDNs), critical to public well-being and
economic stability, face challenges such as pipe blockages and background
leakages, exacerbated by operational constraints such as data non-stationarity
and limited labeled data. This paper proposes an unsupervised, online learning
framework that aims to detect two types of faults in WDNs: pipe blockages,
modeled as collective anomalies, and background leakages, modeled as concept
drift. Our approach combines a Long Short-Term Memory Variational Autoencoder
(LSTM-VAE) with a dual drift detection mechanism, enabling robust detection and
adaptation under non-stationary conditions. Its lightweight, memory-efficient
design enables real-time, edge-level monitoring. Experiments on two realistic
WDNs show that the proposed approach consistently outperforms strong baselines
in detecting anomalies and adapting to recurrent drift, demonstrating its
effectiveness in unsupervised event detection for dynamic WDN environments.

TL;DR: RotaTouille是一个用于轮廓数据学习的深度学习框架，通过复值循环卷积实现旋转和循环平移等变性，并在形状分类、重建和轮廓回归任务中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 轮廓数据在多个领域普遍存在，如计算机视觉中的物体边界、气象学中的等值线等。深度学习模型需要对这些数据的旋转和循环平移具有等变性，以处理起始点选择和旋转变化带来的影响。

Method: 使用复值循环卷积实现旋转和循环平移等变性，引入等变性非线性层、粗化层和全局池化层来获得不变表示，用于下游任务。

Result: 在形状分类、重建和轮廓回归等实验中证明了RotaTouille框架的有效性。

Conclusion: RotaTouille提供了一个有效的深度学习框架，能够处理轮廓数据的旋转和循环平移等变性需求，在多个应用场景中表现出良好的性能。

Abstract: Contours or closed planar curves are common in many domains. For example,
they appear as object boundaries in computer vision, isolines in meteorology,
and the orbits of rotating machinery. In many cases when learning from contour
data, planar rotations of the input will result in correspondingly rotated
outputs. It is therefore desirable that deep learning models be rotationally
equivariant. In addition, contours are typically represented as an ordered
sequence of edge points, where the choice of starting point is arbitrary. It is
therefore also desirable for deep learning methods to be equivariant under
cyclic shifts. We present RotaTouille, a deep learning framework for learning
from contour data that achieves both rotation and cyclic shift equivariance
through complex-valued circular convolution. We further introduce and
characterize equivariant non-linearities, coarsening layers, and global pooling
layers to obtain invariant representations for downstream tasks. Finally, we
demonstrate the effectiveness of RotaTouille through experiments in shape
classification, reconstruction, and contour regression.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着机器学习系统在敏感环境中的广泛应用，确保这些系统不做出歧视性决策变得至关重要。需要了解开源公平性API在实际场景中的使用情况和开发者面临的挑战

Method: 分析了204个GitHub仓库（从1885个候选仓库中筛选），这些仓库使用了13种针对ML软件偏见的API。采用定性研究方法分析使用场景、方式和挑战

Result: 发现API主要用于两个目的（学习和解决实际问题），涵盖17个独特用例。开发者对偏见检测和缓解不够熟悉，面临大量故障排除问题，经常寻求意见和资源

Conclusion: 研究结果对未来偏见相关的软件工程研究具有指导意义，并可为教育工作者开发更先进的课程提供参考

Abstract: Machine Learning software systems are frequently used in our day-to-day
lives. Some of these systems are used in various sensitive environments to make
life-changing decisions. Therefore, it is crucial to ensure that these AI/ML
systems do not make any discriminatory decisions for any specific groups or
populations. In that vein, different bias detection and mitigation open-source
software libraries (aka API libraries) are being developed and used. In this
paper, we conduct a qualitative study to understand in what scenarios these
open-source fairness APIs are used in the wild, how they are used, and what
challenges the developers of these APIs face while developing and adopting
these libraries. We have analyzed 204 GitHub repositories (from a list of 1885
candidate repositories) which used 13 APIs that are developed to address bias
in ML software. We found that these APIs are used for two primary purposes
(i.e., learning and solving real-world problems), targeting 17 unique
use-cases. Our study suggests that developers are not well-versed in bias
detection and mitigation; they face lots of troubleshooting issues, and
frequently ask for opinions and resources. Our findings can be instrumental for
future bias-related software engineering research, and for guiding educators in
developing more state-of-the-art curricula.

Motivation: 解决大学招生中的公平性问题，特别是在申请人群体未知的情况下如何制定公平的录取政策

Method: 比较一次性设置（预先固定透明政策）和顺序设置（根据新申请人数据更新政策），使用历史招生数据训练群体模型来优化录取策略

Result: 分析了一次性设置下所得政策的公平性特性，包括精英主义和群体平等

Conclusion: 提出了针对未知申请人群体的公平招生框架，通过不同设置和模型训练来优化公平性指标

Abstract: We study the problem of fair cohort selection from an unknown population,
with a focus on university admissions. We start with the one-shot setting,
where the admission policy must be fixed in advance and remain transparent,
before observing the actual applicant pool. In contrast, the sequential setting
allows the policy to be updated across stages as new applicant data becomes
available. This is achieved by optimizing admission policies using a population
model, trained on data from previous admission cycles. We also study the
fairness properties of the resulting policies in the one-shot setting,
including meritocracy and group parity.

TL;DR: 提出了一种轻量级、数据高效的图神经网络模型，用于预测多种射频电路拓扑的关键性能指标，相比现有方法在减少训练样本的同时显著提高了预测精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确预测有源射频电路性能对现代无线系统至关重要，但传统仿真工具计算成本高，现有机器学习方法需要大量数据且难以处理复杂分布的性能指标。

Method: 采用设备终端级别的电路图建模方法，结合掩码自回归流输出头，构建拓扑感知的图神经网络模型，以捕获晶体管级对称性和细粒度连接细节。

Result: 实验显示平均对称平均绝对百分比误差为2.40%，平均相对误差为2.91%，相比先前工作使用2.24倍更少训练样本的同时将MRE提高了3.14倍。

Conclusion: 该方法通过引脚级电路图转换和鲁棒的ML架构，为快速准确的射频电路设计自动化提供了有效解决方案，显著降低了数据需求和计算成本。

Abstract: Accurately predicting the performance of active radio frequency (RF) circuits
is essential for modern wireless systems but remains challenging due to highly
nonlinear, layout-sensitive behavior and the high computational cost of
traditional simulation tools. Existing machine learning (ML) surrogates often
require large datasets to generalize across various topologies or to accurately
model skewed and multi-modal performance metrics. In this work, a lightweight,
data-efficient, and topology-aware graph neural network (GNN) model is proposed
for predicting key performance metrics of multiple topologies of active RF
circuits such as low noise amplifiers (LNAs), mixers, voltage-controlled
oscillators (VCOs), and PAs. To capture transistor-level symmetry and preserve
fine-grained connectivity details, circuits are modeled at the device-terminal
level, enabling scalable message passing while reducing data requirements.
Masked autoregressive flow (MAF) output heads are incorporated to improve
robustness in modeling complex target distributions. Experiments on datasets
demonstrate high prediction accuracy, with symmetric mean absolute percentage
error (sMAPE) and mean relative error (MRE) averaging 2.40% and 2.91%,
respectively. Owing to the pin-level conversion of circuit to graph and ML
architecture robust to modeling complex densities of RF metrics, the MRE is
improved by 3.14x while using 2.24x fewer training samples compared to prior
work, demonstrating the method's effectiveness for rapid and accurate RF
circuit design automation.

TL;DR: 提出了Doctor方法，通过双重检查机制改进离线强化学习中的目标回报对齐问题，实现更精确的策略性能控制


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有离线RL方法主要关注最大化累积回报，但实际应用需要精确控制策略性能水平。基于监督学习的RvS方法虽然能提取多样化策略，但在目标回报对齐方面存在不足，特别是在数据集中代表性不足或超出数据集的回报范围内

Method: Doctor方法，通过双重检查机制对Transformer进行目标对齐，改进离线强化学习中的回报对齐能力。该方法能够在内插和外推情况下都实现优异的目标对齐

Result: 在动态治疗机制基准测试EpiCare上，Doctor方法有效调节了治疗策略的激进程度，平衡了治疗效果回报和不良事件风险

Conclusion: Doctor方法解决了现有RvS-based transformers在目标回报对齐方面的局限性，实现了更准确和灵活的策略性能控制，在医疗决策等实际应用中具有重要价值

Abstract: Offline reinforcement learning (RL) has achieved significant advances in
domains such as robotic control, autonomous driving, and medical
decision-making. Most existing methods primarily focus on training policies
that maximize cumulative returns from a given dataset. However, many real-world
applications require precise control over policy performance levels, rather
than simply pursuing the best possible return. Reinforcement learning via
supervised learning (RvS) frames offline RL as a sequence modeling task,
enabling the extraction of diverse policies by conditioning on different
desired returns. Yet, existing RvS-based transformers, such as Decision
Transformer (DT), struggle to reliably align the actual achieved returns with
specified target returns, especially when interpolating within underrepresented
returns or extrapolating beyond the dataset. To address this limitation, we
propose Doctor, a novel approach that Double Checks the Transformer with target
alignment for Offline RL. Doctor achieves superior target alignment both within
and beyond the dataset, while enabling accurate and flexible control over
policy performance. Notably, on the dynamic treatment regime benchmark,
EpiCare, our approach effectively modulates treatment policy aggressiveness,
balancing therapeutic returns against adverse event risk.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用LLM从自然语言规则自动生成棋盘游戏代码，旨在开发LLM辅助的快速棋盘游戏代码生成框架，减少人工实现的时间消耗。

Method: 使用三种先进LLM（Claude、DeepSeek和ChatGPT）对12款流行和冷门游戏进行编码测试，采用匿名化处理避免预训练知识影响，在自由形式和Boardwalk API两种环境下测试可玩性和规则符合性。

Result: 方法可行，最佳模型Claude 3.7 Sonnet达到55.6%的无错误游戏生成率。API合规性增加了错误频率，但错误严重程度主要取决于LLM模型本身。

Conclusion: 研究证明了LLM生成棋盘游戏代码的可行性，为创建集成框架奠定了基础，将使棋盘游戏的开发更加便捷。

Abstract: Implementing board games in code can be a time-consuming task. However, Large
Language Models (LLMs) have been proven effective at generating code for
domain-specific tasks with simple contextual information. We aim to investigate
whether LLMs can implement digital versions of board games from rules described
in natural language. This would be a step towards an LLM-assisted framework for
quick board game code generation. We expect to determine the main challenges
for LLMs to implement the board games, and how different approaches and models
compare to one another. We task three state-of-the-art LLMs (Claude, DeepSeek
and ChatGPT) with coding a selection of 12 popular and obscure games in
free-form and within Boardwalk, our proposed General Game Playing API. We
anonymize the games and components to avoid evoking pre-trained LLM knowledge.
The implementations are tested for playability and rule compliance. We evaluate
success rate and common errors across LLMs and game popularity. Our approach
proves viable, with the best performing model, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, yielding
55.6\% of games without any errors. While compliance with the API increases
error frequency, the severity of errors is more significantly dependent on the
LLM. We outline future steps for creating a framework to integrate this
process, making the elaboration of board games more accessible.

TL;DR: NOSTRA是一种针对噪声、稀疏和稀缺数据的多目标贝叶斯优化算法，通过整合实验不确定性先验知识和信任区域策略，在有限实验预算下高效收敛到帕累托前沿。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多目标贝叶斯优化方法在处理具有实验不确定性、稀疏且观测数据稀缺的问题时表现不佳，导致实验资源分配效率低下和次优设计。

Method: 提出NOSTRA算法框架，整合实验不确定性先验知识构建更精确的代理模型，并采用信任区域策略将采样集中在设计空间的有前景区域。

Result: 在具有不同实验不确定性水平的测试函数上，NOSTRA在处理噪声、稀疏和稀缺数据方面优于现有方法，能有效优先选择能提高帕累托前沿识别精度的区域。

Conclusion: NOSTRA提供了一种资源高效的算法，在有限实验预算的实际场景中确保高效性能，加速收敛到帕累托前沿并提高解决方案质量。

Abstract: Multi-objective Bayesian optimization (MOBO) struggles with sparse
(non-space-filling), scarce (limited observations) datasets affected by
experimental uncertainty, where identical inputs can yield varying outputs.
These challenges are common in physical and simulation experiments (e.g.,
randomized medical trials and, molecular dynamics simulations) and are
therefore incompatible with conventional MOBO methods. As a result,
experimental resources are inefficiently allocated, leading to suboptimal
designs. To address this challenge, we introduce NOSTRA (Noisy and Sparse Data
Trust Region-based Optimization Algorithm), a novel sampling framework that
integrates prior knowledge of experimental uncertainty to construct more
accurate surrogate models while employing trust regions to focus sampling on
promising areas of the design space. By strategically leveraging prior
information and refining search regions, NOSTRA accelerates convergence to the
Pareto frontier, enhances data efficiency, and improves solution quality.
Through two test functions with varying levels of experimental uncertainty, we
demonstrate that NOSTRA outperforms existing methods in handling noisy, sparse,
and scarce data. Specifically, we illustrate that, NOSTRA effectively
prioritizes regions where samples enhance the accuracy of the identified Pareto
frontier, offering a resource-efficient algorithm that is practical in
scenarios with limited experimental budgets while ensuring efficient
performance.

Conclusion: BAD-ACTS基准为智能体系统安全研究提供了多样化测试平台，单个对抗性智能体对系统安全有显著影响，需要更强大的防御机制

Abstract: Ensuring the safe use of agentic systems requires a thorough understanding of
the range of malicious behaviors these systems may exhibit when under attack.
In this paper, we evaluate the robustness of LLM-based agentic systems against
attacks that aim to elicit harmful actions from agents. To this end, we propose
a novel taxonomy of harms for agentic systems and a novel benchmark, BAD-ACTS,
for studying the security of agentic systems with respect to a wide range of
harmful actions. BAD-ACTS consists of 4 implementations of agentic systems in
distinct application environments, as well as a dataset of 188 high-quality
examples of harmful actions. This enables a comprehensive study of the
robustness of agentic systems across a wide range of categories of harmful
behaviors, available tools, and inter-agent communication structures. Using
this benchmark, we analyze the robustness of agentic systems against an
attacker that controls one of the agents in the system and aims to manipulate
other agents to execute a harmful target action. Our results show that the
attack has a high success rate, demonstrating that even a single adversarial
agent within the system can have a significant impact on the security. This
attack remains effective even when agents use a simple prompting-based defense
strategy. However, we additionally propose a more effective defense based on
message monitoring. We believe that this benchmark provides a diverse testbed
for the security research of agentic systems. The benchmark can be found at

Conclusion: FraPPE算法成功填补了PrePEx领域计算效率的空白，为多目标bandit中的帕累托最优识别提供了首个高效最优解决方案

Abstract: Preference-based Pure Exploration (PrePEx) aims to identify with a given
confidence level the set of Pareto optimal arms in a vector-valued (aka
multi-objective) bandit, where the reward vectors are ordered via a (given)
preference cone $\mathcal{C}$. Though PrePEx and its variants are well-studied,
there does not exist a computationally efficient algorithm that can optimally
track the existing lower bound for arbitrary preference cones. We successfully
fill this gap by efficiently solving the minimisation and maximisation problems
in the lower bound. First, we derive three structural properties of the lower
bound that yield a computationally tractable reduction of the minimisation
problem. Then, we deploy a Frank-Wolfe optimiser to accelerate the maximisation
problem in the lower bound. Together, these techniques solve the maxmin
optimisation problem in $\mathcal{O}(KL^{2})$ time for a bandit instance with
$K$ arms and $L$ dimensional reward, which is a significant acceleration over
the literature. We further prove that our proposed PrePEx algorithm, FraPPE,
asymptotically achieves the optimal sample complexity. Finally, we perform
numerical experiments across synthetic and real datasets demonstrating that
FraPPE achieves the lowest sample complexities to identify the exact Pareto set
among the existing algorithms.

Motivation: 深度学习回归器在标签充足时表现优异，但在数据稀缺场景下精度会显著下降。需要一种能够利用专家知识（成对排序信息）来提升回归性能的实用方法。

Method: 提出RankRefine方法：给定查询项和带有已知属性的参考集，通过逆方差加权将基础回归器输出与基于排名的估计相结合，无需重新训练模型。

Conclusion: RankRefine具有实用性和广泛适用性，特别是在低数据设置中，无论是人类专家还是通用大语言模型提供的排序信息都能有效改善回归性能。

Abstract: Accurate prediction of continuous properties is essential to many scientific
and engineering tasks. Although deep-learning regressors excel with abundant
labels, their accuracy deteriorates in data-scarce regimes. We introduce
RankRefine, a model-agnostic, plug-and-play post hoc method that refines
regression with expert knowledge coming from pairwise rankings. Given a query
item and a small reference set with known properties, RankRefine combines the
base regressor's output with a rank-based estimate via inverse variance
weighting, requiring no retraining. In molecular property prediction task,
RankRefine achieves up to 10% relative reduction in mean absolute error using
only 20 pairwise comparisons obtained through a general-purpose large language
model (LLM) with no finetuning. As rankings provided by human experts or
general-purpose LLMs are sufficient for improving regression across diverse
domains, RankRefine offers practicality and broad applicability, especially in
low-data settings.

Conclusion: 这些方法让我们离实际部署解决实际问题的强化学习算法更近了一步，为应对实际世界的数据约束提供了有效的解决方案

Abstract: Modern reinforcement learning (RL) systems capture deep truths about general,
human problem-solving. In domains where new data can be simulated cheaply,
these systems uncover sequential decision-making policies that far exceed the
ability of any human. Society faces many problems whose solutions require this
skill, but they are often in domains where new data cannot be cheaply
simulated. In such scenarios, we can learn simulators from existing data, but
these will only ever be approximately correct, and can be pathologically
incorrect when queried outside of their training distribution. As a result, a
misalignment between the environments in which we train our agents and the
real-world in which we wish to deploy our agents is inevitable. Dealing with
this misalignment is the primary concern of zero-shot reinforcement learning, a
problem setting where the agent must generalise to a new task or domain with
zero practice shots. Whilst impressive progress has been made on methods that
perform zero-shot RL in idealised settings, new work is needed if these results
are to be replicated in real-world settings. In this thesis, we argue that
doing so requires us to navigate (at least) three constraints. First, the data
quality constraint: real-world datasets are small and homogeneous. Second, the
observability constraint: states, dynamics and rewards in the real-world are
often only partially observed. And third, the data availability constraint: a
priori access to data cannot always be assumed. This work proposes a suite of
methods that perform zero-shot RL subject to these constraints. In a series of
empirical studies we expose the failings of existing methods, and justify our
techniques for remedying them. We believe these designs take us a step closer
to RL methods that can be deployed to solve real-world problems.

Abstract: Non-emergency municipal services such as city 311 systems have been widely
implemented across cities in Canada and the United States to enhance residents'
quality of life. These systems enable residents to report issues, e.g., noise
complaints, missed garbage collection, and potholes, via phone calls, mobile
applications, or webpages. However, residents are often given limited
information about when their service requests will be addressed, which can
reduce transparency, lower resident satisfaction, and increase the number of
follow-up inquiries. Predicting the service time for municipal service requests
is challenging due to several complex factors: dynamic spatial-temporal
correlations, underlying interactions among heterogeneous service request
types, and high variation in service duration even within the same request
category. In this work, we propose MuST2-Learn: a Multi-view
Spatial-Temporal-Type Learning framework designed to address the aforementioned
challenges by jointly modeling spatial, temporal, and service type dimensions.
In detail, it incorporates an inter-type encoder to capture relationships among
heterogeneous service request types and an intra-type variation encoder to
model service time variation within homogeneous types. In addition, a
spatiotemporal encoder is integrated to capture spatial and temporal
correlations in each request type. The proposed framework is evaluated with
extensive experiments using two real-world datasets. The results show that
MuST2-Learn reduces mean absolute error by at least 32.5%, which outperforms
state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: FLAMES框架系统评估数学推理数据合成策略，发现增加问题复杂度的数据代理效果最佳，问题覆盖率比解决方案可靠性更重要，并开发出在多个数学基准上表现优异的新数据集


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有改进LLM数学推理的合成数据方法使用不同设置，难以比较数据合成策略，需要系统研究影响合成数学推理数据性能的各种因素

Method: 引入FLAMES框架，系统研究10种现有数据合成策略和多个影响因素，设计两种新颖的数据合成策略以提高域外泛化和鲁棒性

Result: FLAMES数据集在多个数学基准上表现优异（OlympiadBench +15.7, CollegeMath +4.5等），微调Qwen2.5-Math-7B达到81.4%的MATH分数，超越更大模型

Conclusion: 通过系统研究揭示了合成数学推理数据的关键因素，开发的高质量FLAMES数据集显著提升了LLM的数学推理能力，证明了合成数据的巨大潜力

Abstract: Recent works improving LLM math reasoning with synthetic data have used
unique setups, making comparison of data synthesis strategies impractical. This
leaves many unanswered questions about the roles of different factors in the
synthetic data pipeline, such as the impact of filtering low-quality problems.
To address this gap, we introduce FLAMES, a Framework for LLM Assessment of
Math rEasoning Data Synthesis, and perform a systematic study of 10 existing
data synthesis strategies and multiple other factors impacting the performance
of synthetic math reasoning data. Our FLAMES experiments provide several
valuable insights about the optimal balance of difficulty and diversity of
synthetic data. First, data agents designed to increase problem complexity lead
to best improvements on most math metrics. Second, with a fixed data generation
budget, keeping higher problem coverage is more important than keeping only
problems with reliable solutions. Third, GSM8K- and MATH-based synthetic data
can lead to improvements on competition-level benchmarks, showcasing
easy-to-hard generalization. Leveraging insights from our FLAMES experiments,
we design two novel data synthesis strategies for improving out-of-domain
generalization and robustness. Further, we develop the FLAMES dataset, an
effective blend of our novel and existing data synthesis strategies,
outperforming public datasets on OlympiadBench (+15.7), CollegeMath (+4.5),
GSMPlus (+6.5), and MATH (+3.1). Fine-tuning Qwen2.5-Math-7B on the FLAMES
dataset achieves 81.4% on MATH, surpassing larger Llama3 405B, GPT-4o and
Claude 3.5 Sonnet.

TL;DR: RLPF是一个结合强化学习和物理反馈的3D分子生成框架，通过力场评估奖励函数指导扩散模型生成更稳定的分子结构


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的扩散模型在生成3D分子结构时难以保证物理一致性，特别是力场平衡结构的问题

Method: 将3D分子生成建模为马尔可夫决策过程，使用近端策略优化微调等变扩散模型，引入基于力场评估的奖励函数提供物理反馈

Result: 在QM9和GEOM-drug数据集上显著提升了分子稳定性，优于现有方法

Conclusion: 将物理反馈融入生成模型对提高分子结构质量具有重要价值

Abstract: Generating physically realistic 3D molecular structures remains a core
challenge in molecular generative modeling. While diffusion models equipped
with equivariant neural networks have made progress in capturing molecular
geometries, they often struggle to produce equilibrium structures that adhere
to physical principles such as force field consistency. To bridge this gap, we
propose Reinforcement Learning with Physical Feedback (RLPF), a novel framework
that extends Denoising Diffusion Policy Optimization to 3D molecular
generation. RLPF formulates the task as a Markov decision process and applies
proximal policy optimization to fine-tune equivariant diffusion models.
Crucially, RLPF introduces reward functions derived from force-field
evaluations, providing direct physical feedback to guide the generation toward
energetically stable and physically meaningful structures. Experiments on the
QM9 and GEOM-drug datasets demonstrate that RLPF significantly improves
molecular stability compared to existing methods. These results highlight the
value of incorporating physics-based feedback into generative modeling. The
code is available at: https://github.com/ZhijianZhou/RLPF/tree/verl_diffusion.

TL;DR: 提出了PSD算法用于逃离非凸优化中的严格鞍点，具有明确的常数保证和梯度下降与鞍点逃离阶段的严格分离，在理论和实验上验证了其对数维度依赖性和预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 非凸优化中的鞍点问题是阻碍收敛到良好局部最小值的主要挑战，现有方法在理论保证和实际性能方面存在不足，需要开发具有明确常数和严格阶段分离的高效算法。

Method: 提出了扰动鞍点逃离下降（PSD）算法，包含梯度下降阶段和鞍点逃离阶段，使用有限差分变体PSD-Probe和随机扩展PSGD，具有鲁棒的小批量大小设置。

Result: PSD算法以高概率找到(ε,√(ρε))-近似二阶稳定点，梯度评估次数为O(ℓΔ_f/ε²)加上每逃离事件的O((ℓ/√(ρε))log(d/δ))次评估，最多需要O(ℓΔ_f/ε²)个事件。

Conclusion: 该算法在合成函数和实际机器学习任务中验证了理论预测，展示了其对数维度依赖性和预测的每事件函数下降，为逃离严格鞍点提供了完整的算法规范和理论保证。

Abstract: We present a comprehensive theoretical analysis of first-order methods for
escaping strict saddle points in smooth non-convex optimization. Our main
contribution is a Perturbed Saddle-escape Descent (PSD) algorithm with fully
explicit constants and a rigorous separation between gradient-descent and
saddle-escape phases. For a function $f:\mathbb{R}^d\to\mathbb{R}$ with
$\ell$-Lipschitz gradient and $\rho$-Lipschitz Hessian, we prove that PSD finds
an $(\epsilon,\sqrt{\rho\epsilon})$-approximate second-order stationary point
with high probability using at most $O(\ell\Delta_f/\epsilon^2)$ gradient
evaluations for the descent phase plus
$O((\ell/\sqrt{\rho\epsilon})\log(d/\delta))$ evaluations per escape episode,
with at most $O(\ell\Delta_f/\epsilon^2)$ episodes needed. We validate our
theoretical predictions through extensive experiments across both synthetic
functions and practical machine learning tasks, confirming the logarithmic
dimension dependence and the predicted per-episode function decrease. We also
provide complete algorithmic specifications including a finite-difference
variant (PSD-Probe) and a stochastic extension (PSGD) with robust mini-batch
sizing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习模型通常被视为黑盒，缺乏透明度使得难以理解模型预测背后的推理过程，特别是在太阳风暴预测这种关键应用中。

Method: 使用基于LSTM网络和注意力机制的深度学习模型，将太阳活动区域数据建模为时间序列，并采用事后模型无关技术来解释模型预测。

Result: 成功为基于LSTM的太阳风暴预测模型添加了可解释性，能够阐明输入序列对预测输出的贡献因素，并提供对模型行为的深入理解。

Conclusion: 这是首次在基于LSTM的太阳风暴预测模型中实现可解释性，使模型预测更加可靠和可问责，为太阳物理学研究提供了重要工具。

Abstract: A deep learning model is often considered a black-box model, as its internal
workings tend to be opaque to the user. Because of the lack of transparency, it
is challenging to understand the reasoning behind the model's predictions.
Here, we present an approach to making a deep learning-based solar storm
prediction model interpretable, where solar storms include solar flares and
coronal mass ejections (CMEs). This deep learning model, built based on a long
short-term memory (LSTM) network with an attention mechanism, aims to predict
whether an active region (AR) on the Sun's surface that produces a flare within
24 hours will also produce a CME associated with the flare. The crux of our
approach is to model data samples in an AR as time series and use the LSTM
network to capture the temporal dynamics of the data samples. To make the
model's predictions accountable and reliable, we leverage post hoc
model-agnostic techniques, which help elucidate the factors contributing to the
predicted output for an input sequence and provide insights into the model's
behavior across multiple sequences within an AR. To our knowledge, this is the
first time that interpretability has been added to an LSTM-based solar storm
prediction model.

TL;DR: RL微调可以恢复SFT导致的OOD性能损失，主要通过修正奇异向量方向偏移而非寻找新解决方案，低秩和浅层恢复策略可有效恢复70-80%性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 重新审视监督微调(SFT)和强化学习微调(RL-FT)如何影响模型表示和分布外性能，解决先前关于RL优越OOD性能的矛盾报告

Method: 使用24点纸牌游戏的OOD变体和基于频谱的诊断方法，分析SFT和RL-FT对模型奇异值和奇异向量的影响

Result: RL-FT可恢复SFT造成的OOD性能损失（Llama-11B从8.97%到15.38%），但无法完全恢复严重过拟合的情况；奇异向量方向偏移比奇异值大小更重要；低秩和浅层恢复可恢复70-80%性能

Conclusion: RL主要通过抵消SFT引起的方向漂移来提升OOD性能，而非寻找新解决方案；提出了低秩UV合并和浅层重置等低成本恢复方法

Abstract: Training large language models (LLMs) from scratch is increasingly
impractical, making post-training methods such as supervised fine-tuning (SFT)
and reinforcement-learning fine-tuning (RL-FT, e.g., PPO) central to modern
practice. Using an out-of-distribution (OOD) variant of the 24-point card game
and new spectrum-based diagnostics, we revisit how these two stages reshape
model representation and OOD performance. Our key findings are- (1) RL-FT can
restore much of the OOD performance loss from SFT (e.g., Llama-11B 8.97% to
15.38%, Qwen-7B 17.09% to 19.66%). But when SFT induces severe overfitting and
a clear distribution shift, RL-FT cannot fully recover OOD performance. (2)
Direction shifts of singular vectors matter more than singular value
magnitudes. These shifts concentrate on directions linked to the largest and
smallest singular values, leaving the bulk spectrum intact. (3) Low-rank and
shallow recovery is effective: restoring singular vector directions for the top
20% of values or first 25% of layers recovers 70-80% of OOD performance. (4)
Stronger SFT checkpoints enable better recovery by RL, while overfitted ones
resist restoration. These results reconcile prior reports of RL superior OOD
performance: RL primarily counteracts SFT-induced directional drift rather than
finding new solutions. Our spectrum-aware analysis highlights inexpensive
recovery knobs low-rank UV merging and shallow-layer resets that practitioners
can use before costly RL fine-tuning.

Abstract: In the context of industry 4.0, long-serving industrial machines can be
retrofitted with process monitoring capabilities for future use in a smart

systems, which can benefit substantially from the TinyML paradigm. This work
presents a complete TinyML flow from dataset generation, to machine learning

TinyML in industrial process monitoring, the creation of the novel MillingVibes

development of an 8-bit-quantized convolutional neural network (CNN) model with

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 研究发现稀疏自编码器(SAE)的L0超参数设置对特征学习至关重要，过高或过低都会导致特征混合，需要精确设置才能学习到LLM的真实底层特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究将L0视为自由参数，但作者发现L0设置不当会导致SAE无法正确学习LLM的底层特征，需要系统研究L0的影响并找到正确的设置方法。

Method: 使用BatchTopK SAE研究L0的影响，开发了一种确定训练分布上正确L0值的方法，在玩具模型和LLM上验证有效性。

Result: 发现大多数常用SAE的L0设置过低，正确设置L0能在玩具模型中找到真实L0值，在LLM中与稀疏探测性能峰值一致。

Conclusion: 为了训练具有正确特征的SAE，实践者必须精确设置L0超参数，这是SAE成功学习LLM底层特征的关键因素。

Abstract: Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) extract features from LLM internal activations,
meant to correspond to single concepts. A core SAE training hyperparameter is
L0: how many features should fire per token on average. Existing work compares
SAE algorithms using sparsity--reconstruction tradeoff plots, implying L0 is a
free parameter with no single correct value. In this work we study the effect
of L0 on BatchTopK SAEs, and show that if L0 is not set precisely, the SAE
fails to learn the underlying features of the LLM. If L0 is too low, the SAE
will mix correlated features to improve reconstruction. If L0 is too high, the
SAE finds degenerate solutions that also mix features. Further, we demonstrate
a method to determine the correct L0 value for an SAE on a given training
distribution, which finds the true L0 in toy models and coincides with peak
sparse probing performance in LLMs. We find that most commonly used SAEs have
an L0 that is too low. Our work shows that, to train SAEs with correct
features, practitioners must set L0 correctly.

Motivation: 基础模型需要适配下游任务，但在隐私敏感应用中无法直接访问边缘私有数据。现有联邦学习方法忽视了边缘设备的计算资源限制和标注数据稀缺问题

Method: 提出Practical Semi-Supervised Federated Learning (PSSFL)框架，其中边缘设备只有未标注的低分辨率数据，服务器有有限的标注高分辨率数据。设计了Federated Mixture of Experts (FedMox)方法，使用稀疏专家混合架构，包含空间路由器对齐分辨率特征和Soft-Mixture策略稳定半监督学习

Result: 在真实自动驾驶数据集上的目标检测实验表明，FedMox在PSSFL设置下有效适配基础模型，显著提升性能同时控制边缘设备内存成本

Conclusion: 该工作为联邦场景中可扩展和隐私保护的基础模型适配开辟了新途径

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) exhibit remarkable generalization but require
adaptation to downstream tasks, particularly in privacy-sensitive applications.
Due to data privacy regulations, cloud-based FMs cannot directly access private
edge data, limiting their adaptation. Federated learning (FL) provides a
privacy-aware alternative, but existing FL approaches overlook the constraints
imposed by edge devices -- namely, limited computational resources and the
scarcity of labeled data. To address these challenges, we introduce Practical
Semi-Supervised Federated Learning (PSSFL), where edge devices hold only
unlabeled, low-resolution data, while the server has limited labeled,
high-resolution data. In this setting, we propose the Federated Mixture of
Experts (FedMox), a novel framework that enhances FM adaptation in FL. FedMox
tackles computational and resolution mismatch challenges via a sparse
Mixture-of-Experts architecture, employing a spatial router to align features
across resolutions and a Soft-Mixture strategy to stabilize semi-supervised
learning. We take object detection as a case study, and experiments on
real-world autonomous driving datasets demonstrate that FedMox effectively
adapts FMs under PSSFL, significantly improving performance with constrained
memory costs on edge devices. Our work paves the way for scalable and
privacy-preserving FM adaptation in federated scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管语音识别技术发展进步，儿童语音识别仍面临挑战，原因包括声学变异性和标注数据有限。虽然微调成人ASR模型是常见方法，但与平坦起始训练的比较研究仍不充分。

Method: 在多个数据集上比较平坦起始训练，使用不同自监学习表征（WavLM、XEUS）和解码器架构。分析模型缩放效果，以及年龄相关的ASR和语者验证性能。所有实验都使用ESPnet框架进行。

Result: 发现SSL表征存在明显的成人语音偏向，而在儿童语音上进行平坦起始训练可以减缓这种偏差。模型在1B参数以内持续显示性能攽善，超过这个规模后效果平台。还发现像Whisper这样的专有模型在年龄相关分析中表现局限。

Conclusion: 建立了公开可用的基准测试集，为健壮的儿童语音处理提供了训练策略见解。结果强调了开放数据模型对于可靠儿童语音研究的重要性，因为专有模型在这方面存在显著局限性。

Abstract: Despite advancements in ASR, child speech recognition remains challenging due
to acoustic variability and limited annotated data. While fine-tuning adult ASR
models on child speech is common, comparisons with flat-start training remain
underexplored. We compare flat-start training across multiple datasets, SSL
representations (WavLM, XEUS), and decoder architectures. Our results show that
SSL representations are biased toward adult speech, with flat-start training on
child speech mitigating these biases. We also analyze model scaling, finding
consistent improvements up to 1B parameters, beyond which performance plateaus.
Additionally, age-related ASR and speaker verification analysis highlights the
limitations of proprietary models like Whisper, emphasizing the need for
open-data models for reliable child speech research. All investigations are
conducted using ESPnet, and our publicly available benchmark provides insights
into training strategies for robust child speech processing.

TL;DR: 这项研究分析了韩国Naver News平台260万个评论数据，发现在线参与存在显著不平等，少数高活跃用户占据主导地位且更容易发布敌对内容，特别是在政治和社会领域以及总统选举期间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 谨于数字平台预期能促进广泛公共讨论参与，但现实中在线参与度仍然很不平等且未充分研究，本研究意在探索数字参与沟差与敌对性评论之间的联系。

Method: 分析韩国最大新闻聚合平台Naver News上13年内来自620万用户的2.6亿条评论，使用基尼系数和帕尔马指数量化参与不平等程度，采用KC-Electra模型估算敌对性水平。

Result: 发现参与结构极度偏斜，少数频繁用户占据讨论主导地位，特别是在政治和社会领域、热门新闻以及总统选举期间。频繁评论者发布敌对内容的概率显著更高。

Conclusion: 在线讨论主要由一个高度活跃且常带敌意的小众群体不成比例地形成，这一发现为公共数字讨论的行为动态提供了经验性见解。

Abstract: Digital platforms were expected to foster broad participation in public
discourse, yet online engagement remains highly unequal and underexplored. This
study examines the digital participation divide and its link to hostile
engagement in news comment sections. Analyzing 260 million comments from 6.2
million users over 13 years on Naver News, South Korea's largest news
aggregation platform, we quantify participation inequality using the Gini and
Palma indexes and estimate hostility levels with a KC-Electra model, which
outperformed other Korean pre-trained transformers in multi-label
classification tasks. The findings reveal a highly skewed participation
structure, with a small number of frequent users dominating discussions,
particularly in the Politics and Society domains and popular news stories.
Participation inequality spikes during presidential elections, and frequent
commenters are significantly more likely to post hostile content, suggesting
that online discourse is shaped disproportionately by a highly active and often
hostile subset of users. Using individual-level digital trace data, this study
provides empirical insights into the behavioral dynamics of online
participation inequality and its broader implications for public digital
discourse.

TL;DR: 论文提出了PediatricsMQA基准测试，揭示LLM和VLM在儿科医疗任务中存在显著年龄偏见，性能随患者年龄减小而下降，需要开发年龄感知方法确保AI在儿科护理中的公平性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型语言模型和视觉增强语言模型在医疗信息学中表现出系统性年龄偏见，特别是在儿科任务上性能较差，这反映了医学研究中儿科研究资金和代表性不足的问题。

Method: 开发了综合多模态儿科问答基准PediatricsMQA，包含3,417个文本多选题和2,067个视觉多选题，覆盖131个儿科主题和7个发育阶段，采用混合人工-自动流程构建数据集。

Result: 评估最先进的开源模型发现，在年轻群体中性能显著下降，凸显了模型存在的年龄偏见问题。

Conclusion: 需要开发年龄感知方法来确保AI在儿科护理中的公平性和可靠性，解决模型在儿科医疗任务中的系统性偏见问题。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) and vision-augmented LLMs (VLMs) have
significantly advanced medical informatics, diagnostics, and decision support.
However, these models exhibit systematic biases, particularly age bias,
compromising their reliability and equity. This is evident in their poorer
performance on pediatric-focused text and visual question-answering tasks. This
bias reflects a broader imbalance in medical research, where pediatric studies
receive less funding and representation despite the significant disease burden
in children. To address these issues, a new comprehensive multi-modal pediatric
question-answering benchmark, PediatricsMQA, has been introduced. It consists
of 3,417 text-based multiple-choice questions (MCQs) covering 131 pediatric
topics across seven developmental stages (prenatal to adolescent) and 2,067
vision-based MCQs using 634 pediatric images from 67 imaging modalities and 256
anatomical regions. The dataset was developed using a hybrid manual-automatic
pipeline, incorporating peer-reviewed pediatric literature, validated question
banks, existing benchmarks, and existing QA resources. Evaluating
state-of-the-art open models, we find dramatic performance drops in younger
cohorts, highlighting the need for age-aware methods to ensure equitable AI
support in pediatric care.
