### [1] [Beyond CNNs: Efficient Fine-Tuning of Multi-Modal LLMs for Object Detection on Low-Data Regimes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08589)
*Nirmal Elamon,Rouzbeh Davoudi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文比较了微调的传统CNN、零样本预训练多模态LLM和微调多模态LLM在图像中人工文本叠加检测任务上的表现，发现LLM仅需少量数据微调即可显著提升性能，甚至超越需要大量数据的CNN方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索多模态大语言模型在视觉任务中的潜力，特别是在有限数据条件下如何有效利用LLM的动态上下文推理和语言引导能力，解决传统CNN方法需要大量标注数据的问题。

Method: 对传统CNN、零样本预训练多模态LLM和微调多模态LLM进行综合比较，重点研究LLM在少于1000张图像数据上的微调效果。

Result: 微调后的多模态LLM在人工文本叠加检测任务上实现了高达36%的准确率提升，性能匹配或超越了需要大量数据的CNN基线方法。

Conclusion: 多模态LLM在视觉任务中具有出色的适应性和数据效率，为低资源视觉环境下的跨模态学习提供了有效策略，证明了语言引导模型在精确视觉理解中的潜力。

Abstract: The field of object detection and understanding is rapidly evolving, driven
by advances in both traditional CNN-based models and emerging multi-modal large
language models (LLMs). While CNNs like ResNet and YOLO remain highly effective
for image-based tasks, recent transformer-based LLMs introduce new capabilities
such as dynamic context reasoning, language-guided prompts, and holistic scene
understanding. However, when used out-of-the-box, the full potential of LLMs
remains underexploited, often resulting in suboptimal performance on
specialized visual tasks. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive comparison
of fine-tuned traditional CNNs, zero-shot pre-trained multi-modal LLMs, and
fine-tuned multi-modal LLMs on the challenging task of artificial text overlay
detection in images. A key contribution of our study is demonstrating that LLMs
can be effectively fine-tuned on very limited data (fewer than 1,000 images) to
achieve up to 36% accuracy improvement, matching or surpassing CNN-based
baselines that typically require orders of magnitude more data. By exploring
how language-guided models can be adapted for precise visual understanding with
minimal supervision, our work contributes to the broader effort of bridging
vision and language, offering novel insights into efficient cross-modal
learning strategies. These findings highlight the adaptability and data
efficiency of LLM-based approaches for real-world object detection tasks and
provide actionable guidance for applying multi-modal transformers in
low-resource visual environments. To support continued progress in this area,
we have made the code used to fine-tune the models available in our GitHub,
enabling future improvements and reuse in related applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 脑肿瘤分割对诊断和治疗规划至关重要，但类别不平衡和模型泛化能力有限等问题阻碍了进展。

Method: 使用U-Net模型结合焦点损失函数，评估了水平翻转、旋转和缩放三种数据增强策略在公开MRI数据集上的效果。

Result: U-Net配合焦点损失达到了90%的精确度，与最先进方法相当。

Conclusion: 本研究建立了透明、可复现的基准，为未来脑肿瘤分割中的数据增强策略和损失函数设计提供指导。

Abstract: Brain tumor segmentation is crucial for diagnosis and treatment planning, yet
challenges such as class imbalance and limited model generalization continue to
hinder progress. This work presents a reproducible evaluation of U-Net
segmentation performance on brain tumor MRI using focal loss and basic data
augmentation strategies. Experiments were conducted on a publicly available MRI
dataset, focusing on focal loss parameter tuning and assessing the impact of
three data augmentation techniques: horizontal flip, rotation, and scaling. The
U-Net with focal loss achieved a precision of 90%, comparable to
state-of-the-art results. By making all code and results publicly available,
this study establishes a transparent, reproducible baseline to guide future
research on augmentation strategies and loss function design in brain tumor
segmentation.

### [3] [Adjusting Initial Noise to Mitigate Memorization in Text-to-Image Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08625)
*Hyeonggeun Han,Sehwan Kim,Hyungjun Joo,Sangwoo Hong,Jungwoo Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出两种通过调整初始噪声来减少文本到图像扩散模型记忆训练数据的方法，这些方法能促进模型更早脱离记忆吸引盆地，从而在保持图像-文本对齐的同时显著降低记忆化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文本到图像扩散模型存在记忆和复制训练数据的问题，引发隐私和版权担忧。现有方法延迟应用分类器自由引导(CFG)来避免记忆化，但这会导致生成的图像与输入提示对齐不佳。

Method: 1. 发现初始噪声样本对脱离记忆吸引盆地的时间有重要影响；2. 提出两种缓解策略：集体调整和个体调整初始噪声，以找到能促进更早脱离记忆盆地的初始样本。

Result: 这些方法显著减少了记忆化现象，同时保持了良好的图像-文本对齐质量。

Conclusion: 通过精心选择初始噪声样本，可以在不牺牲生成质量的前提下有效缓解扩散模型的记忆化问题，为隐私和版权保护提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Despite their impressive generative capabilities, text-to-image diffusion
models often memorize and replicate training data, prompting serious concerns
over privacy and copyright. Recent work has attributed this memorization to an
attraction basin-a region where applying classifier-free guidance (CFG) steers
the denoising trajectory toward memorized outputs-and has proposed deferring
CFG application until the denoising trajectory escapes this basin. However,
such delays often result in non-memorized images that are poorly aligned with
the input prompts, highlighting the need to promote earlier escape so that CFG
can be applied sooner in the denoising process. In this work, we show that the
initial noise sample plays a crucial role in determining when this escape
occurs. We empirically observe that different initial samples lead to varying
escape times. Building on this insight, we propose two mitigation strategies
that adjust the initial noise-either collectively or individually-to find and
utilize initial samples that encourage earlier basin escape. These approaches
significantly reduce memorization while preserving image-text alignment.

### [4] [The Digital Mirror: Gender Bias and Occupational Stereotypes in AI-Generated Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08628)
*Siiri Leppälampi,Sonja M. Hyrynsalmi,Erno Vanhala*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究测试了AI生成图像中的代表性偏见，发现DALL-E 3和Ideogram在职业图像生成中都会强化传统性别刻板印象，尽管程度不同。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式AI在可视化创作方面提供了巨大机会，但现有研究主要关注创建过程和质量，忽视了代表性偏见问题。

Method: 研究通过生成750多张职业相关的AI图像，使用DALL-E 3和Ideogram两个工具，并进行主题分析来评估性别偏见。

Result: 结果显示两个AI图像生成工具都强化了传统性别刻板印象，存在代表性偏见问题。

Conclusion: AI可视化工具存在强化狭隘代表性的风险，研究为从业者、个人和研究者提出了增加代表性、减少性别偏见的建议。

Abstract: Generative AI offers vast opportunities for creating visualisations, such as
graphics, videos, and images. However, recent studies around AI-generated
visualisations have primarily focused on the creation process and image
quality, overlooking representational biases. This study addresses this gap by
testing representation biases in AI-generated pictures in an occupational
setting and evaluating how two AI image generator tools, DALL-E 3 and Ideogram,
compare. Additionally, the study discusses topics such as ageing and emotions
in AI-generated images. As AI image tools are becoming more widely used,
addressing and mitigating harmful gender biases becomes essential to ensure
diverse representation in media and professional settings. In this study, over
750 AI-generated images of occupations were prompted. The thematic analysis
results revealed that both DALL-E 3 and Ideogram reinforce traditional gender
stereotypes in AI-generated images, although to varying degrees. These findings
emphasise that AI visualisation tools risk reinforcing narrow representations.
In our discussion section, we propose suggestions for practitioners,
individuals and researchers to increase representation when generating images
with visible genders.

### [5] [Dynamic Mixture-of-Experts for Visual Autoregressive Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08629)
*Jort Vincenti,Metod Jazbec,Guoxuan Xia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种集成动态专家混合路由器的视觉自回归模型，通过尺度感知阈值策略在无需额外训练的情况下减少计算冗余，实现了20% FLOPs减少和11%推理加速，同时保持图像质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉自回归模型在图像生成中虽然高效优质，但在递增分辨率下存在重复Transformer调用的计算冗余问题。

Method: 在VAR中集成动态专家混合路由器，采用尺度感知阈值策略，根据token复杂度和分辨率平衡专家选择。

Result: 实现了20% FLOPs减少、11%推理加速，图像质量与密集基线模型相当。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了VAR模型的计算冗余问题，实现了计算效率与图像质量的良好平衡。

Abstract: Visual Autoregressive Models (VAR) offer efficient and high-quality image
generation but suffer from computational redundancy due to repeated Transformer
calls at increasing resolutions. We introduce a dynamic Mixture-of-Experts
router integrated into VAR. The new architecture allows to trade compute for
quality through scale-aware thresholding. This thresholding strategy balances
expert selection based on token complexity and resolution, without requiring
additional training. As a result, we achieve 20% fewer FLOPs, 11% faster
inference and match the image quality achieved by the dense baseline.

### [6] [Out-of-Distribution Detection in LiDAR Semantic Segmentation Using Epistemic Uncertainty from Hierarchical GMMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08631)
*Hanieh Shojaei Miandashti,Claus Brenner*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于层次贝叶斯建模的无监督OOD检测方法，通过分离认知不确定性来改进LiDAR点云中的未知物体检测，无需辅助数据或额外训练阶段。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有无监督OOD检测方法依赖预测熵，但会混淆认知不确定性和偶然不确定性，导致将分布内模糊区域误分类为OOD。需要一种能有效分离这两种不确定性的方法。

Method: 使用层次贝叶斯建模GMM参数在深度神经网络特征空间中的认知不确定性，无需辅助数据或额外训练阶段。

Result: 在SemanticKITTI数据集上，相比现有预测熵方法，AUROC提升18%，AUPRC提升22%，FPR95从76%降至40%（减少36%）。

Conclusion: 该方法通过有效分离认知不确定性，显著提升了无监督OOD检测性能，无需依赖辅助数据集或复杂训练过程。

Abstract: In addition to accurate scene understanding through precise semantic
segmentation of LiDAR point clouds, detecting out-of-distribution (OOD)
objects, instances not encountered during training, is essential to prevent the
incorrect assignment of unknown objects to known classes. While supervised OOD
detection methods depend on auxiliary OOD datasets, unsupervised methods avoid
this requirement but typically rely on predictive entropy, the entropy of the
predictive distribution obtained by averaging over an ensemble or multiple
posterior weight samples. However, these methods often conflate epistemic
(model) and aleatoric (data) uncertainties, misclassifying ambiguous in
distribution regions as OOD. To address this issue, we present an unsupervised
OOD detection approach that employs epistemic uncertainty derived from
hierarchical Bayesian modeling of Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) parameters in
the feature space of a deep neural network. Without requiring auxiliary data or
additional training stages, our approach outperforms existing uncertainty-based
methods on the SemanticKITTI dataset, achieving an 18\% improvement in AUROC,
22\% increase in AUPRC, and 36\% reduction in FPR95 (from 76\% to 40\%),
compared to the predictive entropy approach used in prior works.

### [7] [Hi-OSCAR: Hierarchical Open-set Classifier for Human Activity Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08635)
*Conor McCarthy,Loes Quirijnen,Jan Peter van Zandwijk,Zeno Geradts,Marcel Worring*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Hi-OSCAR：一种用于活动识别的分层开放集分类器，能够在保持最先进准确率的同时拒绝未知活动，并将未知类别定位到最近的内部节点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类活动识别中存在无法逾越的差距：生活中执行的活动范围远大于标注传感器数据集中能捕获的活动范围。未正确处理未见活动会严重削弱HAR分类器的可靠性，且活动类别之间存在不同程度的相似性和层级关系。

Method: 将活动类别组织成结构化层次，提出Hi-OSCAR分层开放集分类器，不仅能识别已知活动，还能拒绝未知活动，并将未知类别定位到层次结构中的最近内部节点。

Result: 开发了新的公开数据集NFI_FARED，包含多个受试者执行的19种不同情境下的活动数据，包括日常生活、通勤和快速运动等。

Conclusion: Hi-OSCAR实现了开放集分类，超越了简单的"已知/未知"二元分类，为未来的开放集HAR研究提供了新的数据集和方法。

Abstract: Within Human Activity Recognition (HAR), there is an insurmountable gap
between the range of activities performed in life and those that can be
captured in an annotated sensor dataset used in training. Failure to properly
handle unseen activities seriously undermines any HAR classifier's reliability.
Additionally within HAR, not all classes are equally dissimilar, some
significantly overlap or encompass other sub-activities. Based on these
observations, we arrange activity classes into a structured hierarchy. From
there, we propose Hi-OSCAR: a Hierarchical Open-set Classifier for Activity
Recognition, that can identify known activities at state-of-the-art accuracy
while simultaneously rejecting unknown activities. This not only enables
open-set classification, but also allows for unknown classes to be localized to
the nearest internal node, providing insight beyond a binary "known/unknown"
classification. To facilitate this and future open-set HAR research, we
collected a new dataset: NFI_FARED. NFI_FARED contains data from multiple
subjects performing nineteen activities from a range of contexts, including
daily living, commuting, and rapid movements, which is fully public and
available for download.

### [8] [Detection of high-frequency oscillations using time-frequency analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08637)
*Mostafa Mohammadpour,Mehdi Zekriyapanah Gashti,Yusif S. Gasimov*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 开发了一种基于无监督聚类的高频振荡检测方法，在80-500Hz频段内区分癫痫相关活动与伪影，在控制数据集上达到97.67%的敏感度和98.57%的精确度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高频振荡是识别癫痫灶的新生物标志物，但人工检测耗时、主观且劳动密集，需要开发自动化检测方法用于研究和临床应用。

Method: 使用S变换从时频域提取事件，采用无监督聚类技术对事件进行分类，区分高频振荡、尖波、背景活动和伪影。

Result: 在控制数据集上敏感度97.67%、精确度98.57%、F分数97.78%；在癫痫患者中，切除与非切除接触点的高频振荡率比值为0.73，与手术结果相关性更强。

Conclusion: 高频振荡是癫痫患者癫痫发生性的有前景生物标志物，切除高频振荡（特别是快速波纹）可达到无癫痫发作，而残留高频振荡会导致癫痫复发。

Abstract: High-frequency oscillations (HFOs) are a new biomarker for identifying the
epileptogenic zone. Mapping HFO-generating regions can improve the precision of
resection sites in patients with refractory epilepsy. However, detecting HFOs
remains challenging, and their clinical features are not yet fully defined.
Visual identification of HFOs is time-consuming, labor-intensive, and
subjective. As a result, developing automated methods to detect HFOs is
critical for research and clinical use. In this study, we developed a novel
method for detecting HFOs in the ripple and fast ripple frequency bands (80-500
Hz). We validated it using both controlled datasets and data from epilepsy
patients. Our method employs an unsupervised clustering technique to categorize
events extracted from the time-frequency domain using the S-transform. The
proposed detector differentiates HFOs events from spikes, background activity,
and artifacts. Compared to existing detectors, our method achieved a
sensitivity of 97.67%, a precision of 98.57%, and an F-score of 97.78% on the
controlled dataset. In epilepsy patients, our results showed a stronger
correlation with surgical outcomes, with a ratio of 0.73 between HFOs rates in
resected versus non-resected contacts. The study confirmed previous findings
that HFOs are promising biomarkers of epileptogenicity in epileptic patients.
Removing HFOs, especially fast ripple, leads to seizure freedom, while
remaining HFOs lead to seizure recurrence.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DINOv2模型感知机制研究：通过稀疏自编码器分析视觉transformer表示，发现功能专业化、几何结构特征，并提出基于概念空间的Minkowski表示假说


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解DINOv2模型在实际应用中感知内容的本质，探索其表示机制的可解释性

Method: 采用线性表示假说，使用稀疏自编码器构建32,000单元字典，分析下游任务的概念使用模式、表示几何结构和统计特性

Result: 发现功能专业化：分类使用"Elsewhere"概念实现否定逻辑，分割依赖边界检测器，深度估计使用三种单目深度线索；表示部分密集而非严格稀疏，具有低维局部连接结构

Conclusion: 提出Minkowski表示假说：token由原型凸组合形成，基于概念空间理论，为视觉transformer表示解释提供新视角

Abstract: DINOv2 is routinely deployed to recognize objects, scenes, and actions; yet
the nature of what it perceives remains unknown. As a working baseline, we
adopt the Linear Representation Hypothesis (LRH) and operationalize it using
SAEs, producing a 32,000-unit dictionary that serves as the interpretability
backbone of our study, which unfolds in three parts.
  In the first part, we analyze how different downstream tasks recruit concepts
from our learned dictionary, revealing functional specialization:
classification exploits "Elsewhere" concepts that fire everywhere except on
target objects, implementing learned negations; segmentation relies on boundary
detectors forming coherent subspaces; depth estimation draws on three distinct
monocular depth cues matching visual neuroscience principles.
  Following these functional results, we analyze the geometry and statistics of
the concepts learned by the SAE. We found that representations are partly dense
rather than strictly sparse. The dictionary evolves toward greater coherence
and departs from maximally orthogonal ideals (Grassmannian frames). Within an
image, tokens occupy a low dimensional, locally connected set persisting after
removing position. These signs suggest representations are organized beyond
linear sparsity alone.
  Synthesizing these observations, we propose a refined view: tokens are formed
by combining convex mixtures of archetypes (e.g., a rabbit among animals, brown
among colors, fluffy among textures). This structure is grounded in Gardenfors'
conceptual spaces and in the model's mechanism as multi-head attention produces
sums of convex mixtures, defining regions bounded by archetypes. We introduce
the Minkowski Representation Hypothesis (MRH) and examine its empirical
signatures and implications for interpreting vision-transformer
representations.

### [10] [PhyDAE: Physics-Guided Degradation-Adaptive Experts for All-in-One Remote Sensing Image Restoration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08653)
*Zhe Dong,Yuzhe Sun,Haochen Jiang,Tianzhu Liu,Yanfeng Gu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出PhyDAE方法，通过两阶段级联架构将退化信息从隐式特征转化为显式决策信号，能够精确识别和差异化处理多种异构退化（雾霾、噪声、模糊、低光照），在保持成像物理一致性的同时显著提升计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的一体化修复方法过度依赖隐式特征表示，缺乏对退化物理的显式建模，难以处理遥感图像采集过程中的复杂异构退化问题。

Method: 采用两阶段级联架构，包含残差流形投影器和频率感知退化分解器，从流形几何和频率角度综合分析退化特征，引入物理感知专家模块和温度控制稀疏激活策略。

Result: 在三个基准数据集上的实验表明，PhyDAE在四个修复任务中均取得优越性能，全面超越最先进方法，同时显著减少参数数量和计算复杂度。

Conclusion: PhyDAE在性能和效率之间实现了最佳平衡，为遥感图像异构退化修复提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Remote sensing images inevitably suffer from various degradation factors
during acquisition, including atmospheric interference, sensor limitations, and
imaging conditions. These complex and heterogeneous degradations pose severe
challenges to image quality and downstream interpretation tasks. Addressing
limitations of existing all-in-one restoration methods that overly rely on
implicit feature representations and lack explicit modeling of degradation
physics, this paper proposes Physics-Guided Degradation-Adaptive Experts
(PhyDAE). The method employs a two-stage cascaded architecture transforming
degradation information from implicit features into explicit decision signals,
enabling precise identification and differentiated processing of multiple
heterogeneous degradations including haze, noise, blur, and low-light
conditions. The model incorporates progressive degradation mining and
exploitation mechanisms, where the Residual Manifold Projector (RMP) and
Frequency-Aware Degradation Decomposer (FADD) comprehensively analyze
degradation characteristics from manifold geometry and frequency perspectives.
Physics-aware expert modules and temperature-controlled sparse activation
strategies are introduced to enhance computational efficiency while ensuring
imaging physics consistency. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets
(MD-RSID, MD-RRSHID, and MDRS-Landsat) demonstrate that PhyDAE achieves
superior performance across all four restoration tasks, comprehensively
outperforming state-of-the-art methods. Notably, PhyDAE substantially improves
restoration quality while achieving significant reductions in parameter count
and computational complexity, resulting in remarkable efficiency gains compared
to mainstream approaches and achieving optimal balance between performance and
efficiency. Code is available at https://github.com/HIT-SIRS/PhyDAE.

### [11] [Hierarchical Scheduling for Multi-Vector Image Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08976)
*Maoliang Li,Ke Li,Yaoyang Liu,Jiayu Chen,Zihao Zheng,Yinjun Wu,Xiang Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了HiMIR框架，通过分层多粒度图像检索和跨层次相似性一致性，在提升检索精度的同时减少3.5倍计算量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统检索方法精度有限，现有多向量检索方法在图像对象对齐和细粒度图像片段冗余方面存在不足

Method: 采用分层多粒度范式增强图像对象对齐，利用跨层次相似性一致性和层次稀疏性减少冗余匹配计算，自动配置数据集参数

Result: 在精度上取得显著提升，计算量比现有MVR系统减少最多3.5倍

Conclusion: HiMIR框架在保持高精度的同时大幅提升检索效率，适用于多样化场景

Abstract: To effectively leverage user-specific data, retrieval augmented generation
(RAG) is employed in multimodal large language model (MLLM) applications.
However, conventional retrieval approaches often suffer from limited retrieval
accuracy. Recent advances in multi-vector retrieval (MVR) improve accuracy by
decomposing queries and matching against segmented images. They still suffer
from sub-optimal accuracy and efficiency, overlooking alignment between the
query and varying image objects and redundant fine-grained image segments. In
this work, we present an efficient scheduling framework for image retrieval -
HiMIR. First, we introduce a novel hierarchical paradigm, employing multiple
intermediate granularities for varying image objects to enhance alignment.
Second, we minimize redundancy in retrieval by leveraging cross-hierarchy
similarity consistency and hierarchy sparsity to minimize unnecessary matching
computation. Furthermore, we configure parameters for each dataset
automatically for practicality across diverse scenarios. Our empirical study
shows that, HiMIR not only achieves substantial accuracy improvements but also
reduces computation by up to 3.5 times over the existing MVR system.

Abstract: Real-world clinical decision-making grapples with integrating information
from diverse data modalities, including medical text, 2D/3D images, and video,
leading to inefficiencies and potential diagnostic oversights. While generalist
vision-language models (VLMs) offer promise, their medical development faces
challenges of opaque pipelines, data scarcity, and architectural inflexibility.
Here we present Hulu-Med, a transparent medical VLM that unifies understanding
across all these modalities. Built upon a unified patch-based vision encoder
and an LLM decoder, Hulu-Med was progressively trained on 16.7 million (M)
samples to scale from 2D to 3D and video comprehension. The medical-aware token
reduction enables efficient training, requiring only 4,000 to 40,000 GPU hours
for 7B to 32B parameter variants. Extensive evaluation across 30 benchmarks
exhibits state-of-the-art performance, surpassing leading open-source models
and competing with proprietary systems in tasks spanning visual
question-answering, medical report generation, and complex reasoning in
multilingual and rare disease scenarios. By open-sourcing our complete
pipeline, we establish that high-performance medical VLM can be achieved
transparently, providing a foundational tool for accessible and impactful
clinical AI. Code is released on

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Puffin是一个统一的相机中心多模态模型，通过将相机视为语言来扩展空间感知能力，能够从任意视角理解和生成场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 相机中心的理解和生成是空间智能的两个基石，但通常被孤立研究。需要开发一个统一的模型来整合这两种能力。

Method: 提出将相机视为语言的新范式，结合语言回归和基于扩散的生成方法。使用包含400万视觉-语言-相机三元组的大规模数据集Puffin-4M进行训练，整合全局相机参数和像素级相机映射。

Result: 实验表明Puffin在相机中心生成和理解任务上优于专用模型，能够泛化到空间想象、世界探索和摄影指导等跨视角任务。

Conclusion: Puffin通过统一的相机中心方法推进了多模态空间智能研究，将发布代码、模型、数据集和基准以促进该领域发展。

Abstract: Camera-centric understanding and generation are two cornerstones of spatial
intelligence, yet they are typically studied in isolation. We present Puffin, a
unified camera-centric multimodal model that extends spatial awareness along
the camera dimension. Puffin integrates language regression and diffusion-based
generation to interpret and create scenes from arbitrary viewpoints. To bridge
the modality gap between cameras and vision-language, we introduce a novel
paradigm that treats camera as language, enabling thinking with camera. This
guides the model to align spatially grounded visual cues with photographic
terminology while reasoning across geometric context. Puffin is trained on
Puffin-4M, a large-scale dataset of 4 million vision-language-camera triplets.
We incorporate both global camera parameters and pixel-wise camera maps,
yielding flexible and reliable spatial generation. Experiments demonstrate
Puffin superior performance over specialized models for camera-centric
generation and understanding. With instruction tuning, Puffin generalizes to
diverse cross-view tasks such as spatial imagination, world exploration, and
photography guidance. We will release the code, models, dataset pipeline, and
benchmark to advance multimodal spatial intelligence research.

Motivation: 传统迁移学习冻结部分权重并添加任务特定层，虽然计算高效但限制了模型适应领域特定特征的能力，在数据有限时仍可能导致过拟合。

Method: SOR框架冻结内部网络结构（如卷积滤波器），同时使用组套索和L1惩罚的组合，仅需最小额外参数即可将模型适配到特定数据。

Conclusion: SOR是一个简单有效的框架，可广泛应用于各种网络组件，为迁移学习任务提供了广泛适用性。

Abstract: Traditional transfer learning typically reuses large pre-trained networks by
freezing some of their weights and adding task-specific layers. While this
approach is computationally efficient, it limits the model's ability to adapt
to domain-specific features and can still lead to overfitting with very limited
data. To address these limitations, we propose Structured Output Regularization
(SOR), a simple yet effective framework that freezes the internal network
structures (e.g., convolutional filters) while using a combination of group
lasso and $L_1$ penalties. This framework tailors the model to specific data
with minimal additional parameters and is easily applicable to various network
components, such as convolutional filters or various blocks in neural networks
enabling broad applicability for transfer learning tasks. We evaluate SOR on
three few shot medical imaging classification tasks and we achieve competitive
results using DenseNet121, and EfficientNetB4 bases compared to established
benchmarks.

TL;DR: BEAR是一个全面的多模态大语言模型具身能力基准测试，包含4,469个跨14个领域的图像-视频-文本条目，涵盖从低级感知到高级规划的6个类别。研究发现现有MLLMs在具身能力方面存在持续局限性，并提出了BEAR-Agent解决方案来显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试主要关注特定领域如规划或空间理解，缺乏对多模态大语言模型具身能力的全面系统评估。

Method: 提出BEAR基准测试，包含4,469个跨14个领域的图像-视频-文本条目，涵盖6个类别。同时开发BEAR-Agent，集成预训练视觉模型来增强MLLM的感知、3D理解和规划能力。

Result: 对20个代表性MLLMs的评估显示它们在所有具身能力领域都存在持续局限性。BEAR-Agent在BEAR基准上实现了9.12%的绝对增益和17.5%的相对改进。

Conclusion: 提升MLLM的具身能力可以有益于模拟环境中的具身任务，BEAR基准为系统评估和提升MLLM的具身能力提供了重要工具。

Abstract: Embodied capabilities refer to a suite of fundamental abilities for an agent
to perceive, comprehend, and interact with the physical world. While multimodal
large language models (MLLMs) show promise as embodied agents, a thorough and
systematic evaluation of their embodied capabilities remains underexplored, as
existing benchmarks primarily focus on specific domains such as planning or
spatial understanding. To bridge this gap, we introduce BEAR, a comprehensive
and fine-grained benchmark that evaluates MLLMs on atomic embodied
capabilities. BEAR comprises 4,469 interleaved image-video-text entries across
14 domains in 6 categories, including tasks from low-level pointing, trajectory
understanding, spatial reasoning, to high-level planning. Extensive evaluation
results of 20 representative MLLMs reveal their persistent limitations across
all domains of embodied capabilities. To tackle the shortfall, we propose
BEAR-Agent, a multimodal conversable agent that integrates pretrained vision
models to strengthen MLLM perception, 3D understanding, and planning
capabilities. It substantially enhances MLLM performance across diverse
embodied capabilities on BEAR, yielding a 9.12% absolute gain and a relative
improvement of 17.5% on GPT-5. Furthermore, our experiments indicate that
improving MLLM embodied capabilities can benefit embodied tasks in simulated
environments. Project website: https://bear-official66.github.io/

*Jiayang Liu,Daniel Tso,Yiming Bu,Qinru Qiu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种受生物学启发的对抗防御框架，通过模拟人类视觉系统的三个关键机制：中央-外周处理、扫视眼动和皮层填充，来有效缓解对抗性攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统防御方法依赖计算密集的优化，而人类视觉系统通过进化机制获得内在的对抗鲁棒性。我们假设注意力引导的非均匀稀疏采样和预测编码在其中起关键作用。

Method: 使用强化学习引导的扫视来选择性捕获多个中央-外周瞥视，将这些瞥视整合成重建图像后再进行分类。该方法无需重新训练或微调下游分类器。

Result: 在ImageNet数据集上的实验表明，该方法能提高系统对各种分类器和攻击类型的鲁棒性，同时显著减少训练开销。

Conclusion: 这种受生物学启发的预处理方法能有效缓解对抗性噪声，保持语义完整性，并能与现有系统无缝集成。

Abstract: Adversarial attacks significantly challenge the safe deployment of deep
learning models, particularly in real-world applications. Traditional defenses
often rely on computationally intensive optimization (e.g., adversarial
training or data augmentation) to improve robustness, whereas the human visual
system achieves inherent robustness to adversarial perturbations through
evolved biological mechanisms. We hypothesize that attention guided
non-homogeneous sparse sampling and predictive coding plays a key role in this
robustness. To test this hypothesis, we propose a novel defense framework
incorporating three key biological mechanisms: foveal-peripheral processing,
saccadic eye movements, and cortical filling-in. Our approach employs
reinforcement learning-guided saccades to selectively capture multiple
foveal-peripheral glimpses, which are integrated into a reconstructed image
before classification. This biologically inspired preprocessing effectively
mitigates adversarial noise, preserves semantic integrity, and notably requires
no retraining or fine-tuning of downstream classifiers, enabling seamless
integration with existing systems. Experiments on the ImageNet dataset
demonstrate that our method improves system robustness across diverse
classifiers and attack types, while significantly reducing training overhead
compared to both biologically and non-biologically inspired defense techniques.

inference times as low as 44 ms with model sizes under 350 MB, highlighting its
deployability in safety-critical contexts. Results from experiments with a real
robot and test datasets indicate that a VGG19 model trained on thermal imaging
performs best.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LinearSR是首个系统解决线性注意力在图像超分辨率中应用难题的框架，通过ESGF策略解决训练不稳定性，SNR-MoE架构缓解感知-失真权衡，TAG轻量级引导范式，实现了高效且高质量的生成式超分辨率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式图像超分辨率模型依赖自注意力的二次复杂度(O(N²))造成计算瓶颈，而线性注意力虽然提供O(N)解决方案，但在真实感超分辨率中面临训练不稳定性和感知-失真权衡等长期未解决的挑战。

Method: 1) 基于"拐点"的早期停止指导微调(ESGF)策略解决训练不稳定性；2) SNR混合专家(MoE)架构缓解感知-失真权衡；3) 基于"精度优先于数量"原则的轻量级TAG引导范式。

Conclusion: 这项工作为在真实感超分辨率领域应用线性注意力提供了首个稳健方法，为高效生成式超分辨率的未来研究建立了基础范式。

Abstract: Generative models for Image Super-Resolution (SR) are increasingly powerful,
yet their reliance on self-attention's quadratic complexity (O(N^2)) creates a
major computational bottleneck. Linear Attention offers an O(N) solution, but
its promise for photorealistic SR has remained largely untapped, historically
hindered by a cascade of interrelated and previously unsolved challenges. This
paper introduces LinearSR, a holistic framework that, for the first time,
systematically overcomes these critical hurdles. Specifically, we resolve a
fundamental, training instability that causes catastrophic model divergence
using our novel "knee point"-based Early-Stopping Guided Fine-tuning (ESGF)
strategy. Furthermore, we mitigate the classic perception-distortion trade-off
with a dedicated SNR-based Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture. Finally, we
establish an effective and lightweight guidance paradigm, TAG, derived from our
"precision-over-volume" principle. Our resulting LinearSR model simultaneously
delivers state-of-the-art perceptual quality with exceptional efficiency. Its
core diffusion forward pass (1-NFE) achieves SOTA-level speed, while its
overall multi-step inference time remains highly competitive. This work
provides the first robust methodology for applying Linear Attention in the
photorealistic SR domain, establishing a foundational paradigm for future
research in efficient generative super-resolution.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统野生动物监测方法（如鸟类腿环标记）耗时且具有侵入性，需要开发非侵入性的自动化识别方案来改进种群监测。

Method: 结合YOLO和Grounding DINO进行目标检测，使用光流模糊检测，DINOv2图像编码和聚类方法，从定制喂食器的视频中提取代表性关键帧。

Result: 所提出的关键帧选择方法在kākā重识别任务中实现了高准确率，为在更具挑战性的环境中使用媒体数据进行研究奠定了基础。

Conclusion: 这种基于人工智能和计算机视觉的非侵入性方法为野生动物监测提供了有价值的替代方案，有助于生态学和保护生物学的新方法发展。

Abstract: Accurate recognition and re-identification of individual animals is essential
for successful wildlife population monitoring. Traditional methods, such as leg
banding of birds, are time consuming and invasive. Recent progress in
artificial intelligence, particularly computer vision, offers encouraging
solutions for smart conservation and efficient automation. This study presents
a unique pipeline for extracting high-quality key frames from videos of
k\={a}k\={a} (Nestor meridionalis), a threatened forest-dwelling parrot in New
Zealand. Key frame extraction is well-studied in person re-identification,
however, its application to wildlife is limited. Using video recordings at a
custom-built feeder, we extract key frames and evaluate the re-identification
performance of our pipeline. Our unsupervised methodology combines object
detection using YOLO and Grounding DINO, optical flow blur detection, image
encoding with DINOv2, and clustering methods to identify representative key
frames. The results indicate that our proposed key frame selection methods
yield image collections which achieve high accuracy in k\={a}k\={a}
re-identification, providing a foundation for future research using media
collected in more diverse and challenging environments. Through the use of
artificial intelligence and computer vision, our non-invasive and efficient
approach provides a valuable alternative to traditional physical tagging
methods for recognising k\={a}k\={a} individuals and therefore improving the
monitoring of populations. This research contributes to developing fresh
approaches in wildlife monitoring, with applications in ecology and
conservation biology.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Q-Router是一个基于多层级模型路由的智能视频质量评估框架，通过视觉语言模型动态选择最适合的专家模型，解决了现有VQA模型泛化性差、可解释性有限和扩展性不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频质量评估模型存在三个主要问题：对不同内容和任务的泛化能力差（从用户生成内容到AI生成内容）、可解释性有限、以及对新用例或内容类型的扩展性不足。

Method: 提出Q-Router框架，集成多种专家模型，使用视觉语言模型作为实时路由器，根据输入视频语义动态推理并集成最合适的专家模型。构建基于计算预算的多层级路由系统，最重层级包含特定的时空伪影定位以实现可解释性。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，Q-Router达到或超越了最先进的VQA模型性能，显著提高了泛化性和可解释性。在质量问答基准Q-Bench-Video上表现优异，并能有效定位时空伪影。

Conclusion: Q-Router通过智能路由设计结合了专业专家模型的互补优势，在异构视频源和任务中实现了灵活性和鲁棒性，有望成为下一代VQA系统的基础，并作为视频生成模型后训练奖励函数的潜力。

Abstract: Video quality assessment (VQA) is a fundamental computer vision task that
aims to predict the perceptual quality of a given video in alignment with human
judgments. Existing performant VQA models trained with direct score supervision
suffer from (1) poor generalization across diverse content and tasks, ranging
from user-generated content (UGC), short-form videos, to AI-generated content
(AIGC), (2) limited interpretability, and (3) lack of extensibility to novel
use cases or content types. We propose Q-Router, an agentic framework for
universal VQA with a multi-tier model routing system. Q-Router integrates a
diverse set of expert models and employs vision--language models (VLMs) as
real-time routers that dynamically reason and then ensemble the most
appropriate experts conditioned on the input video semantics. We build a
multi-tiered routing system based on the computing budget, with the heaviest
tier involving a specific spatiotemporal artifacts localization for
interpretability. This agentic design enables Q-Router to combine the
complementary strengths of specialized experts, achieving both flexibility and
robustness in delivering consistent performance across heterogeneous video
sources and tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Q-Router matches or
surpasses state-of-the-art VQA models on a variety of benchmarks, while
substantially improving generalization and interpretability. Moreover, Q-Router
excels on the quality-based question answering benchmark, Q-Bench-Video,
highlighting its promise as a foundation for next-generation VQA systems.
Finally, we show that Q-Router capably localizes spatiotemporal artifacts,
showing potential as a reward function for post-training video generation
models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有Med-VQA方法在模态对齐方面缺乏统一解决方案，硬负样本问题研究不足，且常用知识融合技术可能引入无关信息

Method: 1) 跨多级别、模态、视图和阶段的异构模态统一对齐方案；2) 使用软标签进行多模态对齐并增强硬负样本对区分的挖掘方法；3) 集成答案词汇作为先验知识并选择相关信息门控交叉注意力模块

Result: 在RAD-VQA、SLAKE、PathVQA和VQA-2019等广泛使用的Med-VQA数据集上超越了先前的最先进方法

Conclusion: 该框架通过解决模态对齐、硬负样本和知识融合等关键挑战，显著提升了Med-VQA任务的性能

Abstract: Medical Visual Question Answering (Med-VQA) is a challenging task that
requires a deep understanding of both medical images and textual questions.
Although recent works leveraging Medical Vision-Language Pre-training (Med-VLP)
have shown strong performance on the Med-VQA task, there is still no unified
solution for modality alignment, and the issue of hard negatives remains
under-explored. Additionally, commonly used knowledge fusion techniques for
Med-VQA may introduce irrelevant information. In this work, we propose a
framework to address these challenges through three key contributions: (1) a
unified solution for heterogeneous modality alignments across multiple levels,
modalities, views, and stages, leveraging methods like contrastive learning and
optimal transport theory; (2) a hard negative mining method that employs soft
labels for multi-modality alignments and enforces the hard negative pair
discrimination; and (3) a Gated Cross-Attention Module for Med-VQA that
integrates the answer vocabulary as prior knowledge and selects relevant
information from it. Our framework outperforms the previous state-of-the-art on
widely used Med-VQA datasets like RAD-VQA, SLAKE, PathVQA and VQA-2019.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SkipSR是一种加速视频超分辨率的方法，通过识别低细节区域并跳过这些区域的计算，仅对需要细化的区域进行超分辨率处理，在保持感知质量的同时显著减少计算量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于扩散的视频超分辨率方法处理所有像素均匀，计算成本高且速度慢，限制了其在高分辨率和长视频中的应用。许多视频区域本质上是低细节的，从细化中获益甚微。

Method: 提出SkipSR框架，直接从低分辨率输入中识别低细节区域，然后完全跳过这些区域的计算，仅对需要细化的区域进行超分辨率处理。

Result: 在标准SR基准测试中，该方法在720p视频上比先前模型实现了高达60%的端到端延迟减少，且没有可感知的质量损失。

Conclusion: SkipSR通过选择性处理视频区域，在保持感知质量的同时显著加速视频超分辨率，为高分辨率和长视频处理提供了可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion-based super-resolution (SR) is a key component in video generation
and video restoration, but is slow and expensive, limiting scalability to
higher resolutions and longer videos. Our key insight is that many regions in
video are inherently low-detail and gain little from refinement, yet current
methods process all pixels uniformly. To take advantage of this, we propose
SkipSR, a simple framework for accelerating video SR by identifying low-detail
regions directly from low-resolution input, then skipping computation on them
entirely, only super-resolving the areas that require refinement. This simple
yet effective strategy preserves perceptual quality in both standard and
one-step diffusion SR models while significantly reducing computation. In
standard SR benchmarks, our method achieves up to 60% faster end-to-end latency
than prior models on 720p videos with no perceptible loss in quality. Video
demos are available at https://rccchoudhury.github.io/skipsr/

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将图像预训练的视觉语言模型适配到视频领域面临挑战，因为需要处理密集且时间上延展的视觉输入，这超出了基于图像模型的能力范围。

Method: 提出动态压缩（自适应选择代表性帧和空间令牌的内容感知聚合）和问题分解（将原始查询重新表述为子问题），两者都是无需训练的。

Result: 实验表明D-CoDe有效提升了各种基准测试中的视频理解能力，在具有挑战性的长视频基准上表现出色。

Conclusion: D-CoDe框架在复杂视频语言任务处理方面具有潜力，代码已开源。

Abstract: Video large language models (Vid-LLMs), which excel in diverse video-language
tasks, can be effectively constructed by adapting image-pretrained
vision-language models (VLMs). However, this adaptation remains challenging, as
it requires processing dense and temporally extended visual inputs that exceed
the capacity of image-based models. This paper identifies the perception
bottleneck and token overload as key challenges in extending image-based VLMs
to the video domain. To address these issues, we propose D-CoDe, a
training-free adaptation framework that incorporates dynamic compression and
question decomposition. Specifically, dynamic compression alleviates the
perception bottleneck through adaptive selection of representative frames and
content-aware aggregation of spatial tokens, thereby reducing redundancy while
preserving informative content. In parallel, question decomposition mitigates
token overload by reformulating the original query into sub-questions, guiding
the model to focus on distinct aspects of the video and enabling more
comprehensive understanding. Experiments demonstrate that D-CoDe effectively
improves video understanding across various benchmarks. Furthermore, strong
performance on the challenging long-video benchmark highlights the potential of
D-CoDe in handling complex video-language tasks. Code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将3D实例映射到2D图像并使用视觉语言模型分类，但会引入2D遮挡噪声且计算成本高，推理速度慢。

Method: 设计教师模型提取高质量实例嵌入，通过标签引导蒸馏算法将开放词汇知识蒸馏到3D学生模型中，学生模型可直接从点云分类实例。

Conclusion: FOLK方法通过知识蒸馏有效解决了开放词汇3D实例分割中的噪声和效率问题，实现了高性能和快速推理。

Abstract: Open-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation seeks to segment and classify
instances beyond the annotated label space. Existing methods typically map 3D
instances to 2D RGB-D images, and then employ vision-language models (VLMs) for
classification. However, such a mapping strategy usually introduces noise from
2D occlusions and incurs substantial computational and memory costs during
inference, slowing down the inference speed. To address the above problems, we
propose a Fast Open-vocabulary 3D instance segmentation method via Label-guided
Knowledge distillation (FOLK). Our core idea is to design a teacher model that
extracts high-quality instance embeddings and distills its open-vocabulary
knowledge into a 3D student model. In this way, during inference, the distilled
3D model can directly classify instances from the 3D point cloud, avoiding
noise caused by occlusions and significantly accelerating the inference
process. Specifically, we first design a teacher model to generate a 2D CLIP
embedding for each 3D instance, incorporating both visibility and viewpoint
diversity, which serves as the learning target for distillation. We then
develop a 3D student model that directly produces a 3D embedding for each 3D
instance. During training, we propose a label-guided distillation algorithm to
distill open-vocabulary knowledge from label-consistent 2D embeddings into the
student model. FOLK conducted experiments on the ScanNet200 and Replica
datasets, achieving state-of-the-art performance on the ScanNet200 dataset with
an AP50 score of 35.7, while running approximately 6.0x to 152.2x faster than
previous methods. All codes will be released after the paper is accepted.

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种无需人工标注的作物生长监测解决方案，能够生成可解释的时间序列模型，具有通用性，可应用于其他作物和场景。

Abstract: Change monitoring is an essential task for cranberry farming as it provides
both breeders and growers with the ability to analyze growth, predict yield,
and make treatment decisions. However, this task is often done manually,
requiring significant time on the part of a cranberry grower or breeder. Deep
learning based change monitoring holds promise, despite the caveat of
hard-to-interpret high dimensional features and hand-annotations for
fine-tuning. To address this gap, we introduce a method for modeling crop
growth based on fine-tuning vision transformers (ViTs) using a self-supervised
approach that avoids tedious image annotations. We use a two-fold pretext task
(time regression and class prediction) to learn a latent space for the
time-lapse evolution of plant and fruit appearance. The resulting 2D temporal
tracks provide an interpretable time-series model of crop growth that can be
used to: 1) predict growth over time and 2) distinguish temporal differences of
cranberry varieties. We also provide a novel time-lapse dataset of cranberry
fruit featuring eight distinct varieties, observed 52 times over the growing
season (span of around four months), annotated with information about fungicide
application, yield, and rot. Our approach is general and can be applied to
other crops and applications (code and dataset can be found at https://github.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PHyCLIP使用双曲空间的ℓ₁-乘积度量来同时表达概念的层次结构和组合性，在零样本分类、检索等任务中优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉语言模型难以同时表达概念族内的层次结构（如狗⊆哺乳动物⊆动物）和跨概念族的组合性（如"车里的狗"⊆狗,车）。双曲空间能有效捕捉树状层次结构，但其对组合性的表达能力尚不明确。

Method: 提出PHyCLIP，在双曲因子的笛卡尔积上使用ℓ₁-乘积度量。概念族内层次结构在单个双曲因子中形成，跨概念族组合通过ℓ₁-乘积度量捕获，类似于布尔代数。

Result: 在零样本分类、检索、层次分类和组合理解任务上的实验表明，PHyCLIP优于现有的单空间方法，并在嵌入空间中提供更可解释的结构。

Conclusion: PHyCLIP通过双曲空间的乘积结构成功解决了同时表达层次结构和组合性的挑战，为多模态表示学习提供了更强大的框架。

Abstract: Vision-language models have achieved remarkable success in multi-modal
representation learning from large-scale pairs of visual scenes and linguistic
descriptions. However, they still struggle to simultaneously express two
distinct types of semantic structures: the hierarchy within a concept family
(e.g., dog $\preceq$ mammal $\preceq$ animal) and the compositionality across
different concept families (e.g., "a dog in a car" $\preceq$ dog, car). Recent
works have addressed this challenge by employing hyperbolic space, which
efficiently captures tree-like hierarchy, yet its suitability for representing
compositionality remains unclear. To resolve this dilemma, we propose PHyCLIP,
which employs an $\ell_1$-Product metric on a Cartesian product of Hyperbolic
factors. With our design, intra-family hierarchies emerge within individual
hyperbolic factors, and cross-family composition is captured by the
$\ell_1$-product metric, analogous to a Boolean algebra. Experiments on
zero-shot classification, retrieval, hierarchical classification, and
compositional understanding tasks demonstrate that PHyCLIP outperforms existing
single-space approaches and offers more interpretable structures in the
embedding space.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的对抗攻击方法在分割模型间的迁移性较差，主要由于模型内部复杂的上下文依赖关系以及代理模型与目标模型之间的特征分布差异。

Method: 将输入样本划分为多个局部区域，重新映射其语义信息生成多样化增强样本，用这些增强样本替代原始样本进行扰动优化，仅保留局部语义信息而非全局信息。

Result: 在PASCAL VOC和Cityscapes两个基准数据集、四种分割模型和三种骨干网络上，SegTrans显著提高了对抗迁移成功率，平均提升8.55%，计算效率提升超过100%。

Conclusion: SegTrans通过局部语义信息重映射有效提升了对抗样本的跨模型迁移能力，且不引入额外计算开销。

Abstract: Segmentation models exhibit significant vulnerability to adversarial examples
in white-box settings, but existing adversarial attack methods often show poor
transferability across different segmentation models. While some researchers
have explored transfer-based adversarial attack (i.e., transfer attack) methods
for segmentation models, the complex contextual dependencies within these
models and the feature distribution gaps between surrogate and target models
result in unsatisfactory transfer success rates. To address these issues, we
propose SegTrans, a novel transfer attack framework that divides the input
sample into multiple local regions and remaps their semantic information to
generate diverse enhanced samples. These enhanced samples replace the original
ones for perturbation optimization, thereby improving the transferability of
adversarial examples across different segmentation models. Unlike existing
methods, SegTrans only retains local semantic information from the original
input, rather than using global semantic information to optimize perturbations.
Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets, PASCAL VOC and Cityscapes,
four different segmentation models, and three backbone networks show that
SegTrans significantly improves adversarial transfer success rates without
introducing additional computational overhead. Compared to the current
state-of-the-art methods, SegTrans achieves an average increase of 8.55% in
transfer attack success rate and improves computational efficiency by more than
100%.

### [28] [Defense against Unauthorized Distillation in Image Restoration via Feature Space Perturbation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08925)
*Han Hu,Zhuoran Zheng,Chen Lyu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出ASVP方法，通过奇异值分解扰动图像恢复模型的内部特征图，有效防御知识蒸馏攻击，在保持教师模型性能的同时显著降低学生模型的学习效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 知识蒸馏攻击威胁深度模型知识产权，现有分类任务的防御方法难以扩展到图像恢复任务，因为恢复任务是生成式任务，具有连续高维输出，需要空间一致性和细节保持。

Method: ASVP方法在运行时对教师模型的内部特征图进行奇异值分解，放大前k个奇异值来注入结构化高频扰动，破坏蒸馏所需的对齐关系。

Result: 在超分辨率、低光增强、水下增强、去雾和去雨等五个图像恢复任务中，ASVP将学生模型的PSNR降低达4dB，SSIM降低60-75%，对教师模型性能影响可忽略。

Conclusion: ASVP为保护开源图像恢复模型免受未经授权的知识蒸馏提供了实用解决方案，相比现有方法提供更强且更一致的防御效果。

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) attacks pose a significant threat to deep model
intellectual property by enabling adversaries to train student networks using a
teacher model's outputs. While recent defenses in image classification have
successfully disrupted KD by perturbing output probabilities, extending these
methods to image restoration is difficult. Unlike classification, restoration
is a generative task with continuous, high-dimensional outputs that depend on
spatial coherence and fine details. Minor perturbations are often insufficient,
as students can still learn the underlying mapping.To address this, we propose
Adaptive Singular Value Perturbation (ASVP), a runtime defense tailored for
image restoration models. ASVP operates on internal feature maps of the teacher
using singular value decomposition (SVD). It amplifies the topk singular values
to inject structured, high-frequency perturbations, disrupting the alignment
needed for distillation. This hinders student learning while preserving the
teacher's output quality.We evaluate ASVP across five image restoration tasks:
super-resolution, low-light enhancement, underwater enhancement, dehazing, and
deraining. Experiments show ASVP reduces student PSNR by up to 4 dB and SSIM by
60-75%, with negligible impact on the teacher's performance. Compared to prior
methods, ASVP offers a stronger and more consistent defense.Our approach
provides a practical solution to protect open-source restoration models from
unauthorized knowledge distillation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在视频理解任务中表现出色，但其在面对被操纵视频内容时的鲁棒性尚未得到充分研究。

Method: 构建Ro-Bench基准测试，包含通过编辑风格、对象、背景及其组合生成的高质量、多样化且时间相关的反事实视频数据，评估了8个最新的视频MLLMs，并展示了使用反事实数据微调模型的方法。

Result: 当前模型在Ro-Bench上面对反事实视频内容时表现出显著的性能下降。通过反事实数据微调，在Ro-Bench上性能提升21.73%，在MVBench数据集的20个任务上平均提升12.78%。

Conclusion: 反事实数据能有效增强MLLMs的视频理解能力，强调了评估和改进模型鲁棒性的重要性。

Abstract: Recently, Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated
significant performance across various video understanding tasks. However,
their robustness, particularly when faced with manipulated video content,
remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we introduce Ro-Bench, the first
benchmark for evaluating MLLMs on dynamic out-of-distribution (OOD)
counterfactual video test sets. Ro-Bench incorporates high-quality, diverse and
temporally relevant video data, by editing Style, Object, Background and their
compositions. We evaluated eight recent video MLLMs and found that current
models exhibit substantial performance degradation on Ro-Bench when exposed to
counterfactual video content. Furthermore, we demonstrate that fine-tuning
MLLMs with counterfactual data enhances robustness, achieving a 21.73%
performance increase on Ro-Bench and a 12.78% improvement across 20 tasks in
the MVBench dataset. These findings underscore the effectiveness of
counterfactual data in enhancing the video understanding ability of MLLMs. The
code and data will be released shortly.

Motivation: 农业监测系统依赖多源数据，但无人机动物健康监测面临数据稀缺问题，包括动物小、遮挡、部分可见等场景特定问题。迁移学习方法因缺乏反映特定农场条件的大数据集而效果有限。

Method: 开发对象聚焦数据增强框架，分割动物与背景，通过变换和基于扩散的合成技术创建真实多样的场景，增强动物检测和监测性能。

Result: 初步实验表明，增强后的数据集在动物检测任务上比基线模型表现更优。

Conclusion: 该方法通过生成领域特定数据，即使在数据稀缺情况下也能支持实时动物健康监测解决方案，弥合有限数据与实际应用之间的差距。

Abstract: Modern agricultural operations increasingly rely on integrated monitoring
systems that combine multiple data sources for farm optimization. Aerial
drone-based animal health monitoring serves as a key component but faces
limited data availability, compounded by scene-specific issues such as small,
occluded, or partially visible animals. Transfer learning approaches often fail
to address this limitation due to the unavailability of large datasets that
reflect specific farm conditions, including variations in animal breeds,
environments, and behaviors. Therefore, there is a need for developing a
problem-specific, animal-focused data augmentation strategy tailored to these
unique challenges. To address this gap, we propose an object-focused data
augmentation framework designed explicitly for animal health monitoring in
constrained data settings. Our approach segments animals from backgrounds and
augments them through transformations and diffusion-based synthesis to create
realistic, diverse scenes that enhance animal detection and monitoring
performance. Our initial experiments demonstrate that our augmented dataset
yields superior performance compared to our baseline models on the animal
detection task. By generating domain-specific data, our method empowers
real-time animal health monitoring solutions even in data-scarce scenarios,
bridging the gap between limited data and practical applicability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有推理时间缩放方法在视觉感知任务中效果有限，因为当前LVLMs采用快速感知范式，将视觉理解视为一次性输出，没有建模底层感知过程。

Method: 提出感知时间缩放(PTS)范式，鼓励丰富的token感知，将复杂感知问题分解为可处理的子问题，结合强化学习技术。

Result: PTS显著提升感知精度，在DisTANCE基准上高精度性能从8.0%提升到64.7%，在领域外任务上泛化良好，即使使用纯合成数据也能提升数学推理和真实世界感知性能。

Conclusion: PTS通过引入更多感知相关token和增加对图像token的关注，使感知能够与推理时间缩放对齐并从中受益。

Abstract: Recent advances in inference-time scaling, particularly those leveraging
reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards, have substantially enhanced the
reasoning capabilities of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). Inspired by
this success, similar strategies have been applied to multimodal reasoning, yet
their impact on visual perception remains unclear. To investigate this gap, we
introduce DisTANCE, a perception-centric benchmark for visual estimation tasks.
Evaluation results show that LVLMs exhibit limited estimation precision, and
inference-time scaling offers only marginal gains. We attribute this to the
fast perception paradigm of current LVLMs, where visual understanding is
treated as a one-shot output without modeling the underlying perceptual
process. To address this, we propose Perception-Time Scaling (PTS), a novel
paradigm that encourages token-rich perception and decomposes complex
perception problems into intermediate tractable sub-problems, thereby enabling
perception to align with and benefit from inference-time scaling. Combined with
reinforcement learning techniques, PTS significantly improves perception
accuracy, raising high-precision performance on DisTANCE from 8.0% to 64.7%,
and generalizes well to out-of-domain tasks. Surprisingly, even though PTS data
are purely synthetic, combining them with math reasoning data yields consistent
gains in both reasoning and real-world perception benchmarks. Further analysis
reveals that PTS introduces more perception-related tokens and increases the
model's attention to image tokens. Our code and data will be publicly released.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在毫米波姿态估计中，稀疏信号和弱反射导致模型从统计先验而非传感器数据推断关节位置，过度依赖先验知识会降低下游任务性能。

Method: 引入mmJoints框架，为黑盒毫米波3D姿态估计器输出添加关节描述符，显式估计关节被感知的可能性和位置预测可靠性。

Result: 在13种姿态估计设置下使用超过115,000个信号帧进行评估，mmJoints估计描述符的错误率低于4.2%，关节位置精度提升达12.5%，活动识别性能提升达16%。

Conclusion: mmJoints通过显式建模姿态估计中的偏差，有效提高了可解释性和下游任务性能，优于现有最先进方法。

Abstract: In mmWave-based pose estimation, sparse signals and weak reflections often
cause models to infer body joints from statistical priors rather than sensor
data. While prior knowledge helps in learning meaningful representations,
over-reliance on it degrades performance in downstream tasks like gesture and
activity recognition. In this paper, we introduce mmJoints, a framework that
augments a pre-trained, black-box mmWave-based 3D pose estimator's output with
additional joint descriptors. Rather than mitigating bias, mmJoints makes it
explicit by estimating the likelihood of a joint being sensed and the
reliability of its predicted location. These descriptors enhance
interpretability and improve downstream task accuracy. Through extensive
evaluations using over 115,000 signal frames across 13 pose estimation
settings, we show that mmJoints estimates descriptors with an error rate below
4.2%. mmJoints also improves joint position accuracy by up to 12.5% and boosts
activity recognition by up to 16% over state-of-the-art methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了首个针对生成手部区域的质量评估任务，开发了HandEval模型，在图像生成和AIGC检测中显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前文本到图像模型在复杂局部区域（特别是人手）生成准确细节方面仍存在困难，生成的手部经常出现结构扭曲和不真实纹理，而手部区域质量评估被忽视，限制了相关下游任务性能。

Method: 引入HandPair数据集（包含48k高质量和低质量手部配对图像），基于此开发HandEval模型，利用多模态大语言模型的视觉理解能力并结合手部关键点先验知识。

Result: HandEval在人工标注测试集上比现有SOTA方法更符合人类判断，在图像生成和AIGC检测应用中分别显著提升了生成手部真实性和检测准确率。

Conclusion: HandEval在下游应用中表现出通用有效性，为手部质量评估和相关应用提供了有力工具。

Abstract: Although recent text-to-image (T2I) models have significantly improved the
overall visual quality of generated images, they still struggle in the
generation of accurate details in complex local regions, especially human
hands. Generated hands often exhibit structural distortions and unrealistic
textures, which can be very noticeable even when the rest of the body is
well-generated. However, the quality assessment of hand regions remains largely
neglected, limiting downstream task performance like human-centric generation
quality optimization and AIGC detection. To address this, we propose the first
quality assessment task targeting generated hand regions and showcase its
abundant downstream applications. We first introduce the HandPair dataset for
training hand quality assessment models. It consists of 48k images formed by
high- and low-quality hand pairs, enabling low-cost, efficient supervision
without manual annotation. Based on it, we develop HandEval, a carefully
designed hand-specific quality assessment model. It leverages the powerful
visual understanding capability of Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) and
incorporates prior knowledge of hand keypoints, gaining strong perception of
hand quality. We further construct a human-annotated test set with hand images
from various state-of-the-art (SOTA) T2I models to validate its quality
evaluation capability. Results show that HandEval aligns better with human
judgments than existing SOTA methods. Furthermore, we integrate HandEval into
image generation and AIGC detection pipelines, prominently enhancing generated
hand realism and detection accuracy, respectively, confirming its universal
effectiveness in downstream applications. Code and dataset will be available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI上色技术存在版权侵权风险，如未经授权对黑白漫画和电影进行上色并转售，目前缺乏有效防护方法。

Method: 提出PAChroma方法，通过拉普拉斯滤波器优化不可察觉的扰动来保持感知质量，并在优化过程中应用多样化输入变换以增强跨模型迁移性和对后处理的鲁棒性。

Result: 在ImageNet和Danbooru数据集上的实验表明，PAChroma能有效降低上色质量同时保持视觉外观。

Conclusion: 这是保护视觉内容免受非法AI上色的首个防御方法，为生成媒体中的版权保护开辟了新途径。

Abstract: AI-based colorization has shown remarkable capability in generating realistic
color images from grayscale inputs. However, it poses risks of copyright
infringement -- for example, the unauthorized colorization and resale of
monochrome manga and films. Despite these concerns, no effective method
currently exists to prevent such misuse. To address this, we introduce the
first defensive paradigm, Uncolorable Examples, which embed imperceptible
perturbations into grayscale images to invalidate unauthorized colorization. To
ensure real-world applicability, we establish four criteria: effectiveness,
imperceptibility, transferability, and robustness. Our method, Perception-Aware
Chroma-Restrictive Perturbation (PAChroma), generates Uncolorable Examples that
meet these four criteria by optimizing imperceptible perturbations with a
Laplacian filter to preserve perceptual quality, and applying diverse input
transformations during optimization to enhance transferability across models
and robustness against common post-processing (e.g., compression). Experiments
on ImageNet and Danbooru datasets demonstrate that PAChroma effectively
degrades colorization quality while maintaining the visual appearance. This
work marks the first step toward protecting visual content from illegitimate AI
colorization, paving the way for copyright-aware defenses in generative media.

Motivation: 自回归文本到图像模型由于顺序token解码过程导致推理速度缓慢，需要数千次模型前向传递来生成单张图像，效率低下。

Method: 引入next-clean-token预测范式，通过低成本微调使预训练自回归模型能够接受噪声扰动token嵌入并预测下一个干净token；在推理时使用高斯噪声初始化token序列，在嵌入空间进行迭代的next-clean-token预测，采用概率标准并行验证和接受多个token。

Result: 实验表明该方法能够通过减少模型前向传递次数来加速生成，同时保持生成图像的视觉质量。

Conclusion: SJD2框架成功解决了自回归文本到图像模型推理效率低下的问题，实现了并行token生成，在保持图像质量的同时显著提升了生成速度。

Abstract: As a new paradigm of visual content generation, autoregressive text-to-image
models suffer from slow inference due to their sequential token-by-token
decoding process, often requiring thousands of model forward passes to generate
a single image. To address this inefficiency, we propose Speculative
Jacobi-Denoising Decoding (SJD2), a framework that incorporates the denoising
process into Jacobi iterations to enable parallel token generation in
autoregressive models. Our method introduces a next-clean-token prediction
paradigm that enables the pre-trained autoregressive models to accept
noise-perturbed token embeddings and predict the next clean tokens through
low-cost fine-tuning. This denoising paradigm guides the model towards more
stable Jacobi trajectories. During inference, our method initializes token
sequences with Gaussian noise and performs iterative
next-clean-token-prediction in the embedding space. We employ a probabilistic
criterion to verify and accept multiple tokens in parallel, and refine the
unaccepted tokens for the next iteration with the denoising trajectory.
Experiments show that our method can accelerate generation by reducing model
forward passes while maintaining the visual quality of generated images.

Result: 实验表明该方法显著减少了LVLMs中的物体幻觉，并能与其他现有方法协同工作

Conclusion: 通过修改视觉编码器识别和屏蔽不确定视觉标记，可以有效缓解大型视觉语言模型的物体幻觉问题

Abstract: Large vision-language models (LVLMs), which integrate a vision encoder (VE)
with a large language model, have achieved remarkable success across various
tasks. However, there are still crucial challenges in LVLMs such as object
hallucination, generating descriptions of objects that are not in the input
image. Here, we argue that uncertain visual tokens within the VE is a key
factor that contributes to object hallucination. Our statistical analysis found
that there are positive correlations between visual tokens with high epistemic
uncertainty and the occurrence of hallucinations. Furthermore, we show
theoretically and empirically that visual tokens in early VE layers that
exhibit large representation deviations under small adversarial perturbations
indicate high epistemic uncertainty. Based on these findings, we propose a
simple yet effective strategy to mitigate object hallucination by modifying the
VE only. Our method comprises a proxy method with adversarial perturbations for
identifying uncertain visual tokens efficiently and a method to mask these
uncertain visual tokens during the self-attention process in the middle layers
of the VE, suppressing their influence on visual encoding and thus alleviating
hallucinations. Extensive experiments show that our method significantly
reduces object hallucinations in LVLMs and can synergistically work with other
prior arts.

Abstract: We present an efficient approach for leveraging the knowledge from multiple
modalities in training unimodal 3D convolutional neural networks (3D-CNNs) for
the task of dynamic hand gesture recognition. Instead of explicitly combining
multimodal information, which is commonplace in many state-of-the-art methods,
we propose a different framework in which we embed the knowledge of multiple
modalities in individual networks so that each unimodal network can achieve an
improved performance. In particular, we dedicate separate networks per
available modality and enforce them to collaborate and learn to develop
networks with common semantics and better representations. We introduce a
"spatiotemporal semantic alignment" loss (SSA) to align the content of the
features from different networks. In addition, we regularize this loss with our
proposed "focal regularization parameter" to avoid negative knowledge transfer.
Experimental results show that our framework improves the test time recognition
accuracy of unimodal networks, and provides the state-of-the-art performance on
various dynamic hand gesture recognition datasets.

Abstract: In this work, we first revisit the sampling issues in current autoregressive
(AR) image generation models and identify that image tokens, unlike text
tokens, exhibit lower information density and non-uniform spatial distribution.
Accordingly, we present an entropy-informed decoding strategy that facilitates
higher autoregressive generation quality with faster synthesis speed.
Specifically, the proposed method introduces two main innovations: 1) dynamic
temperature control guided by spatial entropy of token distributions, enhancing
the balance between content diversity, alignment accuracy, and structural
coherence in both mask-based and scale-wise models, without extra computational
overhead, and 2) entropy-aware acceptance rules in speculative decoding,
achieving near-lossless generation at about 85\% of the inference cost of
conventional acceleration methods. Extensive experiments across multiple
benchmarks using diverse AR image generation models demonstrate the
effectiveness and generalizability of our approach in enhancing both generation
quality and sampling speed.

Abstract: We present a transductive deep learning-based formulation for the sparse
representation-based classification (SRC) method. The proposed network consists
of a convolutional autoencoder along with a fully-connected layer. The role of
the autoencoder network is to learn robust deep features for classification. On
the other hand, the fully-connected layer, which is placed in between the
encoder and the decoder networks, is responsible for finding the sparse
representation. The estimated sparse codes are then used for classification.
Various experiments on three different datasets show that the proposed network
leads to sparse representations that give better classification results than

TL;DR: 提出了DGLSS-NL任务，即噪声标签下的LiDAR语义分割领域泛化，并开发了DuNe双视图框架，通过强分支和弱分支的特征一致性约束和置信度感知过滤，在多个数据集上实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LiDAR标注通常因传感器缺陷、遮挡和人为错误而存在噪声，这种噪声会降低分割精度，并在领域偏移下进一步放大，威胁系统可靠性。现有噪声标签学习方法在3D LiDAR分割中的领域泛化应用尚未充分探索。

Method: 提出了DuNe双视图框架，包含强分支和弱分支，通过特征级一致性约束和基于置信度感知过滤的交叉熵损失来处理噪声标签。

Conclusion: DuNe框架在DGLSS-NL任务中表现出强大的领域泛化能力，为噪声标签下的LiDAR语义分割提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate perception is critical for vehicle safety, with LiDAR as a key
enabler in autonomous driving. To ensure robust performance across
environments, sensor types, and weather conditions without costly
re-annotation, domain generalization in LiDAR-based 3D semantic segmentation is
essential. However, LiDAR annotations are often noisy due to sensor
imperfections, occlusions, and human errors. Such noise degrades segmentation
accuracy and is further amplified under domain shifts, threatening system
reliability. While noisy-label learning is well-studied in images, its
extension to 3D LiDAR segmentation under domain generalization remains largely
unexplored, as the sparse and irregular structure of point clouds limits direct
use of 2D methods. To address this gap, we introduce the novel task Domain
Generalization for LiDAR Semantic Segmentation under Noisy Labels (DGLSS-NL)
and establish the first benchmark by adapting three representative noisy-label
learning strategies from image classification to 3D segmentation. However, we
find that existing noisy-label learning approaches adapt poorly to LiDAR data.
We therefore propose DuNe, a dual-view framework with strong and weak branches
that enforce feature-level consistency and apply cross-entropy loss based on
confidence-aware filtering of predictions. Our approach shows state-of-the-art
performance by achieving 56.86% mIoU on SemanticKITTI, 42.28% on nuScenes, and
52.58% on SemanticPOSS under 10% symmetric label noise, with an overall
Arithmetic Mean (AM) of 49.57% and Harmonic Mean (HM) of 48.50%, thereby
demonstrating robust domain generalization in DGLSS-NL tasks. The code is

Abstract: Image-to-Image translation models can help mitigate various challenges
inherent to medical image acquisition. Latent diffusion models (LDMs) leverage
efficient learning in compressed latent space and constitute the core of
state-of-the-art generative image models. However, this efficiency comes with a
trade-off, potentially compromising crucial pixel-level detail essential for
high-fidelity medical images. This limitation becomes particularly critical
when generating clinically significant structures, such as lesions, which often
occupy only a small portion of the image. Failure to accurately reconstruct
these regions can severely impact diagnostic reliability and clinical
decision-making. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel post-training
framework for LDMs in medical image-to-image translation by incorporating
lesion-aware medical pixel space objectives. This approach is essential, as it
not only enhances overall image quality but also improves the precision of
lesion delineation. We evaluate our framework on brain CT-to-MRI translation in
acute ischemic stroke patients, where early and accurate diagnosis is critical
for optimal treatment selection and improved patient outcomes. While diffusion
MRI is the gold standard for stroke diagnosis, its clinical utility is often
constrained by high costs and low accessibility. Using a dataset of 817
patients, we demonstrate that our framework improves overall image quality and
enhances lesion delineation when synthesizing DWI and ADC images from CT
perfusion scans, outperforming existing image-to-image translation models.
Furthermore, our post-training strategy is easily adaptable to pre-trained LDMs
and exhibits substantial potential for broader applications across diverse
medical image translation tasks.

Abstract: Flexible microelectrode (FME) implantation into brain cortex is challenging
due to the deformable fiber-like structure of FME probe and the interaction
with critical bio-tissue. To ensure reliability and safety, the implantation
process should be monitored carefully. This paper develops an image-based
anomaly detection framework based on the microscopic cameras of the robotic FME
implantation system. The unified framework is utilized at four checkpoints to
check the micro-needle, FME probe, hooking result, and implantation point,
respectively. Exploiting the existing object localization results, the aligned
regions of interest (ROIs) are extracted from raw image and input to a
pretrained vision transformer (ViT). Considering the task specifications, we
propose a progressive granularity patch feature sampling method to address the
sensitivity-tolerance trade-off issue at different locations. Moreover, we
select a part of feature channels with higher signal-to-noise ratios from the
raw general ViT features, to provide better descriptors for each specific
scene. The effectiveness of the proposed methods is validated with the image
datasets collected from our implantation system.

Motivation: 现有法向量估计方法在建模细粒度几何结构方面存在不足，而现有的Mamba方法主要关注全局形状结构，对局部几何细节建模不足。

Method: 提出注意力驱动的层次特征融合方案自适应融合多尺度点云补丁特征，并构建补丁状态空间模型将点云补丁建模为隐式超曲面，通过状态动态实现细粒度几何理解。

Conclusion: MambaH-Fit通过创新的特征融合和状态空间建模，成功解决了点云法向量估计中的细粒度几何结构建模问题，取得了显著性能提升。

Abstract: We present MambaH-Fit, a state space modelling framework tailored for
hyper-surface fitting-based point cloud normal estimation. Existing normal
estimation methods often fall short in modelling fine-grained geometric
structures, thereby limiting the accuracy of the predicted normals. Recently,
state space models (SSMs), particularly Mamba, have demonstrated strong
modelling capability by capturing long-range dependencies with linear
complexity and inspired adaptations to point cloud processing. However,
existing Mamba-based approaches primarily focus on understanding global shape
structures, leaving the modelling of local, fine-grained geometric details
largely under-explored. To address the issues above, we first introduce an
Attention-driven Hierarchical Feature Fusion (AHFF) scheme to adaptively fuse
multi-scale point cloud patch features, significantly enhancing geometric
context learning in local point cloud neighbourhoods. Building upon this, we
further propose Patch-wise State Space Model (PSSM) that models point cloud
patches as implicit hyper-surfaces via state dynamics, enabling effective
fine-grained geometric understanding for normal prediction. Extensive
experiments on benchmark datasets show that our method outperforms existing
ones in terms of accuracy, robustness, and flexibility. Ablation studies
further validate the contribution of the proposed components.

Conclusion: 该研究为无人机检测与跟踪技术的发展提供了有力支持，有效解决了小目标检测和轨迹连续性问题。

Abstract: The extensive application of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) in military
reconnaissance, environmental monitoring, and related domains has created an
urgent need for accurate and efficient multi-object tracking (MOT)
technologies, which are also essential for UAV situational awareness. However,
complex backgrounds, small-scale targets, and frequent occlusions and
interactions continue to challenge existing methods in terms of detection
accuracy and trajectory continuity. To address these issues, this paper
proposes the Global-Local Detection and Tracking (GL-DT) framework. It employs
a Spatio-Temporal Feature Fusion (STFF) module to jointly model motion and
appearance features, combined with a global-local collaborative detection
strategy, effectively enhancing small-target detection. Building upon this, the
JPTrack tracking algorithm is introduced to mitigate common issues such as ID
switches and trajectory fragmentation. Experimental results demonstrate that
the proposed approach significantly improves the continuity and stability of
MOT while maintaining real-time performance, providing strong support for the
advancement of UAV detection and tracking technologies.

TL;DR: 该论文提出将密集的扩散变换器(DiT)转换为专家混合(MoE)结构，通过结构化稀疏化减少激活参数数量，同时保持模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DiT模型参数量大导致推理开销高，现有剪枝方法会因模型容量减少而导致性能严重下降，需要一种既能减少激活参数又能保持模型容量的方法。

Method: 将DiT块中的前馈网络替换为MoE层，减少FFN中62.5%的激活参数；提出混合块(MoB)选择性激活DiT块；设计多步蒸馏流程，包括基于泰勒度量的专家初始化、负载均衡的知识蒸馏和MoB优化的组特征损失。

Result: 将大型扩散变换器(如FLUX.1)转换为MoE结构，激活参数减少60%，同时保持原始性能，在广泛实验中超越基于剪枝的方法。

Conclusion: Dense2MoE为高效文本到图像生成建立了新范式，通过结构化稀疏化在减少计算开销的同时保持模型性能。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformer (DiT) has demonstrated remarkable performance in
text-to-image generation; however, its large parameter size results in
substantial inference overhead. Existing parameter compression methods
primarily focus on pruning, but aggressive pruning often leads to severe
performance degradation due to reduced model capacity. To address this
limitation, we pioneer the transformation of a dense DiT into a Mixture of
Experts (MoE) for structured sparsification, reducing the number of activated
parameters while preserving model capacity. Specifically, we replace the
Feed-Forward Networks (FFNs) in DiT Blocks with MoE layers, reducing the number
of activated parameters in the FFNs by 62.5\%. Furthermore, we propose the
Mixture of Blocks (MoB) to selectively activate DiT blocks, thereby further
enhancing sparsity. To ensure an effective dense-to-MoE conversion, we design a
multi-step distillation pipeline, incorporating Taylor metric-based expert
initialization, knowledge distillation with load balancing, and group feature
loss for MoB optimization. We transform large diffusion transformers (e.g.,
FLUX.1 [dev]) into an MoE structure, reducing activated parameters by 60\%
while maintaining original performance and surpassing pruning-based approaches
in extensive experiments. Overall, Dense2MoE establishes a new paradigm for
efficient text-to-image generation.

Abstract: Intelligent analysis of medical imaging plays a crucial role in assisting
clinical diagnosis, especially for identifying subtle pathological features.
This paper introduces a novel multi-branch ConvNeXt architecture designed
specifically for the nuanced challenges of medical image analysis. While
applied here to the specific problem of COVID-19 diagnosis, the methodology
offers a generalizable framework for classifying a wide range of pathologies
from CT scans. The proposed model incorporates a rigorous end-to-end pipeline,
from meticulous data preprocessing and augmentation to a disciplined two-phase
training strategy that leverages transfer learning effectively. The
architecture uniquely integrates features extracted from three parallel
branches: Global Average Pooling, Global Max Pooling, and a new
Attention-weighted Pooling mechanism. The model was trained and validated on a
combined dataset of 2,609 CT slices derived from two distinct datasets.
Experimental results demonstrate a superior performance on the validation set,
achieving a final ROC-AUC of 0.9937, a validation accuracy of 0.9757, and an
F1-score of 0.9825 for COVID-19 cases, outperforming all previously reported
models on this dataset. These findings indicate that a modern, multi-branch
architecture, coupled with careful data handling, can achieve performance
comparable to or exceeding contemporary state-of-the-art models, thereby
proving the efficacy of advanced deep learning techniques for robust medical
diagnostics.

TL;DR: SOS是一个简单可扩展的数据合成流水线，通过对象中心组合策略将高质量合成对象片段粘贴到新图像中，使用结构化布局先验和生成式重光照，产生准确多样的掩码、边界框和指代表达式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉分组任务需要大量标注数据，但真实数据标注成本高、存在偏见且难以扩展。合成数据有潜力但缺乏灵活性、准确性和组合多样性。

Method: 基于对象中心的组合策略，使用结构化布局先验和生成式重光照技术，将高质量合成对象片段粘贴到新图像中。

Result: 在10万张合成图像上训练的模型在检测和定位任务上优于在更大真实图像数据集（如GRIT和V3Det）上训练的模型，在LVIS检测上提升+10.9 AP，在gRefCOCO定位上提升+8.4 N_Acc。

Conclusion: SOS支持可控数据集构建，在低数据和封闭词汇设置下改善泛化能力，增强LVIS和COCO数据集能带来跨真实数据规模的强性能，在极有限真实数据下获得更大收益。

Abstract: Visual grouping -- operationalized via instance segmentation, visual
grounding, and object detection -- underpins applications from robotic
perception to photo editing. Large annotated datasets are costly, biased in
coverage, and hard to scale. Synthetic data are promising but often lack
flexibility, accuracy, and compositional diversity.
  We present SOS, a simple and scalable data synthesis pipeline based on an
object-centric composition strategy. It pastes high-quality synthetic object
segments into new images using structured layout priors and generative
relighting, producing accurate and diverse masks, boxes, and referring
expressions. Models trained on 100000 synthetic images from SOS outperform
those trained on larger real-image datasets such as GRIT (20M) and V3Det (200K)
on detection and grounding tasks, achieving +10.9 AP on LVIS detection and +8.4
$N_{\text{Acc}}$ on gRefCOCO grounding. SOS enables controllable dataset
construction and improves generalization in both low-data and closed-vocabulary
settings. Augmenting LVIS and COCO with synthetic object segments yields strong
performance across real-data scales and even larger gains under extremely
limited real data (for example, +3.83 $AP_{\text{rare}}$ on LVIS instance
segmentation and +6.59 AP with a 1 percent COCO setup). This controllability
also supports targeted data generation for challenging intra-class referring in
visual grounding.

Motivation: 计算病理学中标注数据稀缺，特别是对于罕见或非典型形态的细胞和细胞核，手动标注成本高昂且耗时，需要一种成本效益高的合成数据生成方法。

Method: 使用多模态语义扩散模型，通过水平/垂直映射表示细胞/细胞核形态、RGB颜色特征和BERT编码的检测/指示元数据来条件化生成过程，并通过多头交叉注意力整合这些异质模态。

Result: 合成图像与真实数据高度匹配，在匹配生物条件下生成图像与真实图像的嵌入具有低Wasserstein距离，合成样本显著提高了柱状细胞分割模型的准确性。

Conclusion: 多模态扩散增强策略有效提升了细胞和细胞核分割模型的鲁棒性和泛化能力，为生成模型在计算病理学中的广泛应用铺平了道路。

Abstract: Scarcity of annotated data, particularly for rare or atypical morphologies,
present significant challenges for cell and nuclei segmentation in
computational pathology. While manual annotation is labor-intensive and costly,
synthetic data offers a cost-effective alternative. We introduce a Multimodal
Semantic Diffusion Model (MSDM) for generating realistic pixel-precise
image-mask pairs for cell and nuclei segmentation. By conditioning the
generative process with cellular/nuclear morphologies (using horizontal and
vertical maps), RGB color characteristics, and BERT-encoded assay/indication
metadata, MSDM generates datasests with desired morphological properties. These
heterogeneous modalities are integrated via multi-head cross-attention,
enabling fine-grained control over the generated images. Quantitative analysis
demonstrates that synthetic images closely match real data, with low
Wasserstein distances between embeddings of generated and real images under
matching biological conditions. The incorporation of these synthetic samples,
exemplified by columnar cells, significantly improves segmentation model
accuracy on columnar cells. This strategy systematically enriches data sets,
directly targeting model deficiencies. We highlight the effectiveness of
multimodal diffusion-based augmentation for advancing the robustness and
generalizability of cell and nuclei segmentation models. Thereby, we pave the
way for broader application of generative models in computational pathology.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PSepT是一种可分离的正交变换，通过将DCT径向基与傅里叶谐波角基进行张量积构造，解决了极坐标中的不可分离性问题，大幅降低了计算复杂度和内存需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统正交矩图像表示方法存在高计算复杂度和数值不稳定性问题，特别是Zernike和伪Zernike矩需要耦合的径向-角度处理，导致计算复杂度高达O(n^3N^2)到O(n^6N^2)，条件数缩放为O(N^4)。

Method: 提出PSepT（极坐标可分离变换），通过离散余弦变换径向基和傅里叶谐波角基的张量积构造实现完全核分解，实现独立的径向和角度处理。

Result: PSepT将计算复杂度降至O(N^2 log N)，内存需求降至O(N^2)，条件数缩放降至O(√N)，相比多项式方法有指数级改进。实验显示更好的数值稳定性、计算效率和竞争性的分类性能。

Conclusion: PSepT的可分离框架实现了传统方法无法实现的高阶矩分析，为稳健的图像分析应用开辟了新的可能性。

Abstract: Orthogonal moment-based image representations are fundamental in computer
vision, but classical methods suffer from high computational complexity and
numerical instability at large orders. Zernike and pseudo-Zernike moments, for
instance, require coupled radial-angular processing that precludes efficient
factorization, resulting in $\mathcal{O}(n^3N^2)$ to $\mathcal{O}(n^6N^2)$
complexity and $\mathcal{O}(N^4)$ condition number scaling for the $n$th-order
moments on an $N\times N$ image. We introduce \textbf{PSepT} (Polar Separable
Transform), a separable orthogonal transform that overcomes the
non-separability barrier in polar coordinates. PSepT achieves complete kernel
factorization via tensor-product construction of Discrete Cosine Transform
(DCT) radial bases and Fourier harmonic angular bases, enabling independent
radial and angular processing. This separable design reduces computational
complexity to $\mathcal{O}(N^2 \log N)$, memory requirements to
$\mathcal{O}(N^2)$, and condition number scaling to $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{N})$,
representing exponential improvements over polynomial approaches. PSepT
exhibits orthogonality, completeness, energy conservation, and
rotation-covariance properties. Experimental results demonstrate better
numerical stability, computational efficiency, and competitive classification
performance on structured datasets, while preserving exact reconstruction. The
separable framework enables high-order moment analysis previously infeasible
with classical methods, opening new possibilities for robust image analysis
applications.

Method: 探索训练特征归因方法，该方法将测试预测与特定训练图像的特定区域联系起来。

Result: 在视觉数据集上的实验表明，训练特征归因提供了细粒度的、测试特定的解释：它识别了导致错误分类的有害示例，并揭示了传统归因方法未能暴露的虚假相关性（如基于补丁的捷径）。

Conclusion: 训练特征归因方法能够提供比传统方法更深入的模型解释，揭示模型学习过程中的潜在问题和偏差。

Abstract: Deep neural networks are often considered opaque systems, prompting the need
for explainability methods to improve trust and accountability. Existing
approaches typically attribute test-time predictions either to input features
(e.g., pixels in an image) or to influential training examples. We argue that
both perspectives should be studied jointly. This work explores *training
feature attribution*, which links test predictions to specific regions of
specific training images and thereby provides new insights into the inner
workings of deep models. Our experiments on vision datasets show that training
feature attribution yields fine-grained, test-specific explanations: it
identifies harmful examples that drive misclassifications and reveals spurious
correlations, such as patch-based shortcuts, that conventional attribution
methods fail to expose.

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种无需CT扫描的支气管镜导航辅助方案，仅需模型数据训练即可实现准确的拓扑定位，具有临床应用潜力。

Abstract: Video bronchoscopy is a fundamental procedure in respiratory medicine, where
medical experts navigate through the bronchial tree of a patient to diagnose or
operate the patient. Surgeons need to determine the position of the scope as
they go through the airway until they reach the area of interest. This task is
very challenging for practitioners due to the complex bronchial tree structure
and varying doctor experience and training. Navigation assistance to locate the
bronchoscope during the procedure can improve its outcome. Currently used
techniques for navigational guidance commonly rely on previous CT scans of the
patient to obtain a 3D model of the airway, followed by tracking of the scope
with additional sensors or image registration. These methods obtain accurate
locations but imply additional setup, scans and training. Accurate metric
localization is not always required, and a topological localization with regard
to a generic airway model can often suffice to assist the surgeon with
navigation. We present an image-based bronchoscopy topological localization
pipeline to provide navigation assistance during the procedure, with no need of
patient CT scan. Our approach is trained only on phantom data, eliminating the
high cost of real data labeling, and presents good generalization capabilities.
The results obtained surpass existing methods, particularly on real data test
sequences.

Motivation: 实例级识别需要识别单个对象而非类别，这种细粒度特性使得大规模标注数据集创建困难，限制了ILR在实际应用中的广泛使用。

Method: 通过合成方法从多个领域生成多样化对象实例，在不同条件和背景下形成大规模训练集，无需依赖任何真实图像，然后基于生成数据微调基础视觉模型。

Conclusion: 该方法引入了一种新的ILR范式，仅需目标领域名称作为输入，即可解锁广泛的现实世界应用，解决了ILR领域的数据稀缺问题。

Abstract: Instance-level recognition (ILR) focuses on identifying individual objects
rather than broad categories, offering the highest granularity in image
classification. However, this fine-grained nature makes creating large-scale
annotated datasets challenging, limiting ILR's real-world applicability across
domains. To overcome this, we introduce a novel approach that synthetically
generates diverse object instances from multiple domains under varied
conditions and backgrounds, forming a large-scale training set. Unlike prior
work on automatic data synthesis, our method is the first to address
ILR-specific challenges without relying on any real images. Fine-tuning
foundation vision models on the generated data significantly improves retrieval
performance across seven ILR benchmarks spanning multiple domains. Our approach
offers a new, efficient, and effective alternative to extensive data collection
and curation, introducing a new ILR paradigm where the only input is the names
of the target domains, unlocking a wide range of real-world applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TARO是一个新颖的开放世界目标检测框架，不仅能识别未知物体，还能将其分类到语义层次结构中的粗粒度父类别，相比传统方法仅标记为'Unknown'更具实用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统目标检测器局限于'封闭世界'假设，遇到未知物体时存在风险。虽然开放集检测方法能识别未知实例，但将所有未知物体归为单一类别'Unknown'在实际应用中不够充分，需要更细粒度的分类来支持安全关键场景的决策。

Method: TARO采用独特架构：1）基于sparsemax的头部建模物体性；2）层次引导的重标记组件提供辅助监督；3）分类模块学习层次关系。

Result: 实验显示TARO能将高达29.9%的未知物体分类到有意义的粗粒度类别，显著减少未知与已知类别间的混淆，在未知召回率和已知类别mAP方面都达到竞争性性能。

Conclusion: TARO框架通过将未知物体分类到语义层次结构中的父类别，为开放世界目标检测提供了更实用的解决方案，特别适用于自动驾驶等安全关键场景。

Abstract: Modern object detectors are largely confined to a "closed-world" assumption,
limiting them to a predefined set of classes and posing risks when encountering
novel objects in real-world scenarios. While open-set detection methods aim to
address this by identifying such instances as 'Unknown', this is often
insufficient. Rather than treating all unknowns as a single class, assigning
them more descriptive subcategories can enhance decision-making in
safety-critical contexts. For example, identifying an object as an 'Unknown
Animal' (requiring an urgent stop) versus 'Unknown Debris' (requiring a safe
lane change) is far more useful than just 'Unknown' in autonomous driving. To
bridge this gap, we introduce TARO, a novel detection framework that not only
identifies unknown objects but also classifies them into coarse parent
categories within a semantic hierarchy. TARO employs a unique architecture with
a sparsemax-based head for modeling objectness, a hierarchy-guided relabeling
component that provides auxiliary supervision, and a classification module that
learns hierarchical relationships. Experiments show TARO can categorize up to
29.9% of unknowns into meaningful coarse classes, significantly reduce
confusion between unknown and known classes, and achieve competitive
performance in both unknown recall and known mAP. Code will be made available.

batch-processing which prohibits its use in an online setting. In this work, we
overcome this limitation and introduce online VDA (oVDA). The key innovation is
to employ techniques from Large Language Models (LLMs), namely, caching latent
features during inference and masking frames at training. Our oVDA method
outperforms all competing online video depth estimation methods in both
accuracy and VRAM usage. Low VRAM usage is particularly important for
deployment on edge devices. We demonstrate that oVDA runs at 42 FPS on an
NVIDIA A100 and at 20 FPS on an NVIDIA Jetson edge device. We will release
both, code and compilation scripts, making oVDA easy to deploy on low-power
hardware.

Abstract: Cricket shot classification from video sequences remains a challenging
problem in sports video analysis, requiring effective modeling of both spatial
and temporal features. This paper presents the first comprehensive baseline
study comparing seven different deep learning approaches across four distinct
research paradigms for cricket shot classification. We implement and
systematically evaluate traditional CNN-LSTM architectures, attention-based
models, vision transformers, transfer learning approaches, and modern
EfficientNet-GRU combinations on a unified benchmark. A critical finding of our
study is the significant performance gap between claims in academic literature
and practical implementation results. While previous papers reported accuracies
of 96\% (Balaji LRCN), 99.2\% (IJERCSE), and 93\% (Sensors), our standardized
re-implementations achieve 46.0\%, 55.6\%, and 57.7\% respectively. Our modern
SOTA approach, combining EfficientNet-B0 with a GRU-based temporal model,
achieves 92.25\% accuracy, demonstrating that substantial improvements are
possible with modern architectures and systematic optimization. All
implementations follow modern MLOps practices with PyTorch Lightning, providing
a reproducible research platform that exposes the critical importance of
standardized evaluation protocols in sports video analysis research.

*Mukilan Karuppasamy,Shankar Gangisetty,Shyam Nandan Rai,Carlo Masone,C V Jawahar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个可解释的驾驶员意图预测框架VCBM，通过DAAD-X数据集和概念瓶颈模型生成时空一致的解释，证明基于Transformer的模型比CNN模型具有更好的可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着自动驾驶系统与人类交互增加，决策过程的可解释性对安全驾驶至关重要。深度学习系统需要理解环境表示和驾驶任务，但目前存在挑战。

Method: 提出了DAAD-X多模态数据集，包含驾驶员眼动和车辆视角的层次化文本解释。开发了Video Concept Bottleneck Model (VCBM)框架，无需后处理技术即可生成时空一致的解释。

Result: 在DAAD-X数据集上的评估表明，基于Transformer的模型比传统CNN模型具有更好的可解释性。还引入了多标签t-SNE可视化技术展示解释之间的解耦和因果关联。

Conclusion: VCBM框架为自动驾驶系统提供了可解释的驾驶员意图预测能力，通过概念瓶颈模型和Transformer架构实现了更好的解释生成和可视化分析。

Abstract: Autonomous driving (AD) systems are becoming increasingly capable of handling
complex tasks, mainly due to recent advances in deep learning and AI. As
interactions between autonomous systems and humans increase, the
interpretability of decision-making processes in driving systems becomes
increasingly crucial for ensuring safe driving operations. Successful
human-machine interaction requires understanding the underlying representations
of the environment and the driving task, which remains a significant challenge
in deep learning-based systems. To address this, we introduce the task of
interpretability in maneuver prediction before they occur for driver safety,
i.e., driver intent prediction (DIP), which plays a critical role in AD
systems. To foster research in interpretable DIP, we curate the eXplainable
Driving Action Anticipation Dataset (DAAD-X), a new multimodal, ego-centric
video dataset to provide hierarchical, high-level textual explanations as
causal reasoning for the driver's decisions. These explanations are derived
from both the driver's eye-gaze and the ego-vehicle's perspective. Next, we
propose Video Concept Bottleneck Model (VCBM), a framework that generates
spatio-temporally coherent explanations inherently, without relying on post-hoc
techniques. Finally, through extensive evaluations of the proposed VCBM on the
DAAD-X dataset, we demonstrate that transformer-based models exhibit greater
interpretability than conventional CNN-based models. Additionally, we introduce
a multilabel t-SNE visualization technique to illustrate the disentanglement
and causal correlation among multiple explanations. Our data, code and models
are available at: https://mukil07.github.io/VCBM.github.io/

*Huimin Liu,Jing Gao,Daria Baran,AxelX Montout,Neill W Campbell,Andrew W Dowsey*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Cattle-CLIP是一个基于多模态深度学习框架的牛只行为识别系统，通过语义线索提升视频特征识别性能，在监督学习和少样本学习场景下均表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 牛只行为是评估动物健康、生产力和福利的重要指标。现有视频监测方法在数据稀缺的行为识别任务中存在性能局限，需要开发能够有效利用有限数据的识别框架。

Method: 基于CLIP大规模图像-语言模型，添加时间整合模块，采用定制化数据增强策略和专门设计的文本提示，以弥合预训练模型与真实牛只监控视频之间的领域差距。

Result: 在CattleBehaviours6数据集上，监督学习场景下总体准确率达到96.1%，其中进食、饮水和站立反刍行为的召回率接近100%，在少样本场景下也表现出良好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 多模态学习在农业和动物行为分析中具有巨大潜力，Cattle-CLIP框架为数据稀缺条件下的牛只行为识别提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Cattle behaviour is a crucial indicator of an individual animal health,
productivity and overall well-being. Video-based monitoring, combined with deep
learning techniques, has become a mainstream approach in animal biometrics, and
it can offer high accuracy in some behaviour recognition tasks. We present
Cattle-CLIP, a multimodal deep learning framework for cattle behaviour
recognition, using semantic cues to improve the performance of video-based
visual feature recognition. It is adapted from the large-scale image-language
model CLIP by adding a temporal integration module. To address the domain gap
between web data used for the pre-trained model and real-world cattle
surveillance footage, we introduce tailored data augmentation strategies and
specialised text prompts. Cattle-CLIP is evaluated under both fully-supervised
and few-shot learning scenarios, with a particular focus on data-scarce
behaviour recognition - an important yet under-explored goal in livestock
monitoring. To evaluate the proposed method, we release the CattleBehaviours6
dataset, which comprises six types of indoor behaviours: feeding, drinking,
standing-self-grooming, standing-ruminating, lying-self-grooming and
lying-ruminating. The dataset consists of 1905 clips collected from our John
Oldacre Centre dairy farm research platform housing 200 Holstein-Friesian cows.
Experiments show that Cattle-CLIP achieves 96.1% overall accuracy across six
behaviours in a supervised setting, with nearly 100% recall for feeding,
drinking and standing-ruminating behaviours, and demonstrates robust
generalisation with limited data in few-shot scenarios, highlighting the
potential of multimodal learning in agricultural and animal behaviour analysis.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种通用的时间分辨Transformer（TRT）架构，通过专门设计的时空自注意力编码器和交叉注意力解码器，显著提升了光子效率成像中的3D重建性能，并在LOS和NLOS成像任务中超越了现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决时间分辨系统中由于传感器量子效率低和噪声水平高导致的3D重建挑战，特别是在长距离或复杂场景下。

Method: 设计了TRT架构，包含时空自注意力编码器（通过分割或下采样探索局部和全局相关性）和时空交叉注意力解码器（在token空间整合局部和全局特征）。开发了TRT-LOS和TRT-NLOS两个任务特定实现。

Result: 在合成数据和真实世界数据上的广泛实验表明，两个实现都显著优于现有方法。贡献了大规模高分辨率合成LOS数据集和真实世界NLOS测量数据。

Conclusion: TRT架构通过专门设计的注意力机制有效提升了光子效率成像的3D重建性能，为LOS和NLOS成像提供了通用解决方案。

Abstract: Transient measurements, captured by the timeresolved systems, are widely
employed in photon-efficient reconstruction tasks, including line-of-sight
(LOS) and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) imaging. However, challenges persist in
their 3D reconstruction due to the low quantum efficiency of sensors and the
high noise levels, particularly for long-range or complex scenes. To boost the
3D reconstruction performance in photon-efficient imaging, we propose a generic
Time-Resolved Transformer (TRT) architecture. Different from existing
transformers designed for high-dimensional data, TRT has two elaborate
attention designs tailored for the spatio-temporal transient measurements.
Specifically, the spatio-temporal self-attention encoders explore both local
and global correlations within transient data by splitting or downsampling
input features into different scales. Then, the spatio-temporal cross attention
decoders integrate the local and global features in the token space, resulting
in deep features with high representation capabilities. Building on TRT, we
develop two task-specific embodiments: TRT-LOS for LOS imaging and TRT-NLOS for
NLOS imaging. Extensive experiments demonstrate that both embodiments
significantly outperform existing methods on synthetic data and real-world data
captured by different imaging systems. In addition, we contribute a
large-scale, high-resolution synthetic LOS dataset with various noise levels
and capture a set of real-world NLOS measurements using a custom-built imaging
system, enhancing the data diversity in this field. Code and datasets are
available at https://github.com/Depth2World/TRT.

*Wuyang Li,Wentao Pan,Po-Chien Luan,Yang Gao,Alexandre Alahi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Stable Video Infinity (SVI)方法，能够生成无限长度视频，具有高时间一致性、合理的场景转换和可控的流式故事情节。通过错误回收微调技术，让模型从自身生成的错误中学习，解决了训练与推理阶段的数据分布差异问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有长视频生成方法主要关注减少累积误差，但仍局限于单一提示词外推，产生同质化场景和重复动作。核心挑战在于训练时使用干净数据，而推理时却基于自回归生成的有误差输出，存在假设差距。

Method: 采用错误回收微调技术，通过闭环回收机制将Diffusion Transformer的自生成错误转化为监督提示。具体包括：注入历史错误干预干净输入；用一步双向积分高效近似预测；动态将错误存入重放记忆库跨时间步复用。

Result: SVI能够将视频从秒级扩展到无限时长，无需额外推理成本，同时兼容多种条件（音频、骨架、文本流）。在三个基准测试中验证了其多功能性和最先进性能。

Conclusion: SVI通过错误回收微调有效解决了长视频生成中的假设差距问题，实现了无限长度视频生成，在一致性、创造性和条件生成方面都表现出色。

Abstract: We propose Stable Video Infinity (SVI) that is able to generate
infinite-length videos with high temporal consistency, plausible scene
transitions, and controllable streaming storylines. While existing long-video
methods attempt to mitigate accumulated errors via handcrafted anti-drifting
(e.g., modified noise scheduler, frame anchoring), they remain limited to
single-prompt extrapolation, producing homogeneous scenes with repetitive
motions. We identify that the fundamental challenge extends beyond error
accumulation to a critical discrepancy between the training assumption (seeing
clean data) and the test-time autoregressive reality (conditioning on
self-generated, error-prone outputs). To bridge this hypothesis gap, SVI
incorporates Error-Recycling Fine-Tuning, a new type of efficient training that
recycles the Diffusion Transformer (DiT)'s self-generated errors into
supervisory prompts, thereby encouraging DiT to actively identify and correct
its own errors. This is achieved by injecting, collecting, and banking errors
through closed-loop recycling, autoregressively learning from error-injected
feedback. Specifically, we (i) inject historical errors made by DiT to
intervene on clean inputs, simulating error-accumulated trajectories in flow
matching; (ii) efficiently approximate predictions with one-step bidirectional
integration and calculate errors with residuals; (iii) dynamically bank errors
into replay memory across discretized timesteps, which are resampled for new
input. SVI is able to scale videos from seconds to infinite durations with no
additional inference cost, while remaining compatible with diverse conditions
(e.g., audio, skeleton, and text streams). We evaluate SVI on three benchmarks,
including consistent, creative, and conditional settings, thoroughly verifying
its versatility and state-of-the-art role.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 跨域序列推荐系统需要准确捕捉域内和跨域行为模式，以提供个性化消费体验。现有方法在语义理解和跨域建模方面存在局限。

Method: 使用LLM为物品生成描述性标签，将标签嵌入与物品ID、文本和视觉特征融合构建增强表示，引入标签增强的多注意力机制联合建模域内和跨域用户偏好。

Result: 在四个大规模电商数据集上的实验表明，TEMA-LLM持续优于现有最先进基线方法。

Conclusion: LLM驱动的语义标签和多注意力集成对面向消费者的推荐系统具有显著优势，展示了LLM在推进智能用户中心服务方面的潜力。

Abstract: Cross-Domain Sequential Recommendation (CDSR) plays a crucial role in modern
consumer electronics and e-commerce platforms, where users interact with
diverse services such as books, movies, and online retail products. These
systems must accurately capture both domain-specific and cross-domain
behavioral patterns to provide personalized and seamless consumer experiences.
To address this challenge, we propose \textbf{TEMA-LLM} (\textit{Tag-Enriched
Multi-Attention with Large Language Models}), a practical and effective
framework that integrates \textit{Large Language Models (LLMs)} for semantic
tag generation and enrichment. Specifically, TEMA-LLM employs LLMs to assign
domain-aware prompts and generate descriptive tags from item titles and
descriptions. The resulting tag embeddings are fused with item identifiers as
well as textual and visual features to construct enhanced item representations.
A \textit{Tag-Enriched Multi-Attention} mechanism is then introduced to jointly
model user preferences within and across domains, enabling the system to
capture complex and evolving consumer interests. Extensive experiments on four
large-scale e-commerce datasets demonstrate that TEMA-LLM consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, underscoring the benefits of LLM-based
semantic tagging and multi-attention integration for consumer-facing
recommendation systems. The proposed approach highlights the potential of LLMs
to advance intelligent, user-centric services in the field of consumer
electronics.

Abstract: Adverse weather conditions such as haze, rain, and snow significantly degrade
the quality of images and videos, posing serious challenges to intelligent
transportation systems (ITS) that rely on visual input. These degradations
affect critical applications including autonomous driving, traffic monitoring,
and surveillance. This survey presents a comprehensive review of image and

further classified based on their scope: single-task models,
multi-task/multi-weather systems, and all-in-one frameworks capable of handling
diverse degradations. In addition, we discuss day and night time restoration
challenges, benchmark datasets, and evaluation protocols. The survey concludes
with an in-depth discussion on limitations in current research and outlines
future directions such as mixed/compound-degradation restoration, real-time
deployment, and agentic AI frameworks. This work aims to serve as a valuable

Motivation: 在医疗资源匮乏地区，肩部疾病早期准确诊断面临挑战，需要低成本、易扩展的辅助诊断方案。

Method: 提出HMVDx框架，使用两个MLLMs分别完成动作理解和疾病诊断任务，并引入基于医疗决策逻辑的可使用性指标。

Result: HMVDx在肩关节损伤诊断中的准确率比直接视频诊断提高了79.6%。

Conclusion: 该研究展示了低成本MLLMs在医疗应用中的潜力，为未来MLLMs在医疗视频理解领域的应用提供了重要技术贡献。

Abstract: Shoulder disorders, such as frozen shoulder (a.k.a., adhesive capsulitis),
are common conditions affecting the health of people worldwide, and have a high
incidence rate among the elderly and workers engaged in repetitive shoulder
tasks. In regions with scarce medical resources, achieving early and accurate
diagnosis poses significant challenges, and there is an urgent need for
low-cost and easily scalable auxiliary diagnostic solutions. This research
introduces videos captured by consumer-grade devices as the basis for
diagnosis, reducing the cost for users. We focus on the innovative application
of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) in the preliminary diagnosis of
shoulder disorders and propose a Hybrid Motion Video Diagnosis framework
(HMVDx). This framework divides the two tasks of action understanding and
disease diagnosis, which are respectively completed by two MLLMs. In addition
to traditional evaluation indicators, this work proposes a novel metric called
Usability Index by the logical process of medical decision-making (action
recognition, movement diagnosis, and final diagnosis). This index evaluates the
effectiveness of MLLMs in the medical field from the perspective of the entire
medical diagnostic pathway, revealing the potential value of low-cost MLLMs in
medical applications for medical practitioners. In experimental comparisons,
the accuracy of HMVDx in diagnosing shoulder joint injuries has increased by
79.6\% compared with direct video diagnosis, a significant technical
contribution to future research on the application of MLLMs for video
understanding in the medical field.

TL;DR: 本文通过建立零样本基准测试，系统比较了视觉语言模型与专用模型在图像隐私预测任务上的表现，发现尽管VLMs参数更多、推理更慢，但在隐私预测准确性上仍落后于专用小模型，但在图像扰动鲁棒性方面表现更好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前文献倾向于采用通用视觉语言模型进行图像隐私预测，但缺乏系统评估，可能忽略了专用模型的性能上限。本文旨在通过建立公平比较基准来解决这个问题。

Method: 建立零样本图像隐私分类基准，评估排名前三的开源VLMs，使用任务对齐的提示词，并与已建立的视觉专用和多模态方法进行性能、效率和鲁棒性对比。

Result: 反直觉地发现，尽管VLMs资源密集、参数多、推理慢，但在隐私预测准确性上仍落后于专用小模型；但VLMs对图像扰动表现出更高的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 在图像隐私预测任务中，专用模型仍保持性能优势，而VLMs在鲁棒性方面表现更好，这为模型选择提供了重要参考。

Abstract: While specialized learning-based models have historically dominated image
privacy prediction, the current literature increasingly favours adopting large
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) designed for generic tasks. This trend risks
overlooking the performance ceiling set by purpose-built models due to a lack
of systematic evaluation. To address this problem, we establish a zero-shot
benchmark for image privacy classification, enabling a fair comparison. We
evaluate the top-3 open-source VLMs, according to a privacy benchmark, using
task-aligned prompts and we contrast their performance, efficiency, and
robustness against established vision-only and multi-modal methods.
Counter-intuitively, our results show that VLMs, despite their
resource-intensive nature in terms of high parameter count and slower
inference, currently lag behind specialized, smaller models in privacy
prediction accuracy. We also find that VLMs exhibit higher robustness to image
perturbations.

Conclusion: DSE方法能够可靠地检测黑盒视觉语言模型中的幻觉，通过量化语义不一致性显著提高了诊断答案的准确性，为临床VLM应用提供了有效的过滤策略。

Abstract: To determine whether using discrete semantic entropy (DSE) to reject
questions likely to generate hallucinations can improve the accuracy of
black-box vision-language models (VLMs) in radiologic image based visual
question answering (VQA). This retrospective study evaluated DSE using two
publicly available, de-identified datasets: (i) the VQA-Med 2019 benchmark (500
images with clinical questions and short-text answers) and (ii) a diagnostic
radiology dataset (206 cases: 60 computed tomography scans, 60 magnetic
resonance images, 60 radiographs, 26 angiograms) with corresponding
ground-truth diagnoses. GPT-4o and GPT-4.1 answered each question 15 times
using a temperature of 1.0. Baseline accuracy was determined using
low-temperature answers (temperature 0.1). Meaning-equivalent responses were
grouped using bidirectional entailment checks, and DSE was computed from the
relative frequencies of the resulting semantic clusters. Accuracy was
recalculated after excluding questions with DSE > 0.6 or > 0.3. p-values and
95% confidence intervals were obtained using bootstrap resampling and a
Bonferroni-corrected threshold of p < .004 for statistical significance. Across
706 image-question pairs, baseline accuracy was 51.7% for GPT-4o and 54.8% for
GPT-4.1. After filtering out high-entropy questions (DSE > 0.3), accuracy on
the remaining questions was 76.3% (retained questions: 334/706) for GPT-4o and
63.8% (retained questions: 499/706) for GPT-4.1 (both p < .001). Accuracy gains
were observed across both datasets and largely remained statistically
significant after Bonferroni correction. DSE enables reliable hallucination
detection in black-box VLMs by quantifying semantic inconsistency. This method
significantly improves diagnostic answer accuracy and offers a filtering
strategy for clinical VLM applications.

Result: 代码和模型将公开

Conclusion: 提出的统一框架能够有效结合时序定位和视频分割能力

Abstract: Referring Video Object Segmentation (RefVOS) seeks to segment target objects
in videos guided by natural language descriptions, demanding both temporal
reasoning and fine-grained visual comprehension. Existing sampling strategies
for LLM-based approaches typically rely on either handcrafted heuristics or
external keyframe models. The former often overlooks essential temporal cues,
while the latter increases system complexity. To address this, we propose a
unified framework that jointly optimizes Temporal Sentence Grounding (TSG) and
RefVOS, naturally incorporating key moment grounding capability. During
training, we introduce a novel TSG paradigm that employs a dedicated
\texttt{[FIND]} token for key moment identification through temporal token
similarity matching, thereby avoiding the need for external timestamp
encodings. For inference, we design a Moment-Centric Sampling (MCS) strategy
that densely samples informative moments while sparsely sampling non-essential
frames, preserving both motion details and global context. To further enhance
tracking stability, we develop Bidirectional Anchor-updated Propagation (BAP),
which leverages the most relevant moment as start point for high-quality mask
initialization and dynamically updates at sampled points to mitigate
accumulated errors. Code and model will be available at:

Abstract: While Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has advanced the
reasoning capabilities of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs), most existing
methods in multimodal reasoning neglect the critical role of visual perception
within the RLVR optimization process. In this paper, we undertake a pioneering
exploration of multimodal RLVR through the novel perspective of token
perception, which measures the visual dependency of each generated token. With
a granular analysis of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) processes, we uncover two key
insights: first, token perception in a rollout trajectory is sparsely
distributed, where only a small fraction of tokens have high visual dependency
for visually-grounded reasoning; second, different trajectories exhibit
significant divergence in their overall visual dependency. Based on these
observations, we propose Visually-Perceptive Policy Optimization (VPPO), a
novel policy gradient algorithm that explicitly leverages token perception to
refine the learning signal. Specifically, VPPO achieves this through a dual
mechanism: it reweights a trajectory's advantage by its overall visual
dependency, and focuses policy updates exclusively on perceptually pivotal
tokens. On a comprehensive suite of eight perception and reasoning benchmarks,
VPPO demonstrates substantial gains over leading open-source RL-tuned models,
with its effectiveness consistently validated across 7B and 32B model scales.
Our findings not only establish a new token-level perceptual perspective for
analyzing multimodal RLVR but also present a novel and effective optimization
strategy to significantly enhance the multimodal reasoning capabilities of
LVLMs.

*Tejaswi V. Panchagnula*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 人类视觉注视在扫描图像时遵循类似动物觅食的Levy行走模式，这种随机轨迹具有重尾步长分布，在稀疏资源环境中具有最优效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统模型强调基于图像的显著性，但眼动的基本时空统计特性仍未充分探索。理解这些动态在注意力建模和基于视觉的界面中具有广泛应用。

Method: 进行了大规模人类受试者实验，40名参与者在无约束条件下观看50张多样化图像，使用高速眼动仪记录超过400万个注视点。训练卷积神经网络从图像输入预测注视热图。

Result: 分析显示人类眼睛的注视轨迹遵循类似动物觅食的Levy行走模式。CNN模型能够准确再现新颖图像中的显著注视区域，表明注视行为的关键组件可以从视觉结构中学习。

Conclusion: 人类视觉探索遵循类似于自然觅食的统计规律，为通过生成和预测框架建模注视开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Animals often forage via Levy walks stochastic trajectories with heavy tailed
step lengths optimized for sparse resource environments. We show that human
visual gaze follows similar dynamics when scanning images. While traditional
models emphasize image based saliency, the underlying spatiotemporal statistics
of eye movements remain underexplored. Understanding these dynamics has broad
applications in attention modeling and vision-based interfaces. In this study,
we conducted a large scale human subject experiment involving 40 participants
viewing 50 diverse images under unconstrained conditions, recording over 4
million gaze points using a high speed eye tracker. Analysis of these data
shows that the gaze trajectory of the human eye also follows a Levy walk akin
to animal foraging. This suggests that the human eye forages for visual
information in an optimally efficient manner. Further, we trained a
convolutional neural network (CNN) to predict fixation heatmaps from image
input alone. The model accurately reproduced salient fixation regions across
novel images, demonstrating that key components of gaze behavior are learnable
from visual structure alone. Our findings present new evidence that human
visual exploration obeys statistical laws analogous to natural foraging and
open avenues for modeling gaze through generative and predictive frameworks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了CapGeo框架，通过将几何图形转换为文本描述来提升多模态大语言模型的几何推理能力，并创建了CapGeo-Bench基准数据集进行评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有最先进的多模态大语言模型在几何推理方面表现不佳，瓶颈在于理解几何图形而非推理能力本身。由于几何图形可以用简洁文本描述，将视觉内容转换为标题是一个有前景的方向。

Method: 引入CapGeo框架，使用标题辅助推理来桥接视觉和文本模态。同时提出CapGeo-Bench数据集，包含4,641个精选的图形-标题对，并采用基于关键点的评估指标。

Result: 实验显示配备标题后模型性能显著提升：Qwen2.5-VL-72B从8.6%提升到59.0%，Claude-Opus-4从44.8%提升到73.0%。评估指标与下游性能强相关。

Conclusion: 该框架和基准为推进多模态大语言模型的几何推理能力开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Geometric reasoning remains a core challenge for Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs). Even the most advanced closed-source systems, such as GPT-O3
and Gemini-2.5-Pro, still struggle to solve geometry problems reliably, despite
exhibiting strong textual reasoning abilities on tasks like the International
Mathematical Olympiad (IMO). This gap suggests that the bottleneck lies in
understanding geometric diagrams rather than reasoning itself. Since geometric
figures can often be faithfully described in concise textual form, converting
visual content into captions offers a promising direction. Motivated by this
insight, we introduce CapGeo, a caption-assisted reasoning framework that
bridges visual and textual modalities. Experiments show substantial
improvements when models are equipped with captions: Qwen2.5-VL-72B improves
from 8.6% (vision-only) to 59.0%, while Claude-Opus-4 rises from 44.8% to
73.0%. To systematically evaluate and identify high-quality geometric
captioning models, we further propose CapGeo-Bench, a dataset of 4,641 curated
figure-caption pairs. Crucially, CapGeo-Bench incorporates a keypoint-based
evaluation metric that correlates strongly with downstream CapGeo performance,
enabling reliable assessment of geometric captioning ability. Together, our
framework and benchmark highlight a new pathway toward advancing geometric
reasoning in MLLMs.

Motivation: 现有基于扩散的方法存在模型尺寸大、迭代去噪慢、推理延迟高等问题，阻碍了实际部署，需要开发更高效的无线电地图生成方法。

Method: 提出RadioFlow框架，学习噪声和数据之间的连续传输轨迹，实现单步高效采样，显著加速训练和推理过程。

Result: 实验表明RadioFlow在保持重建精度的同时，相比领先的扩散基线(RadioDiff)参数减少8倍，推理速度提升4倍以上。

Conclusion: RadioFlow为未来6G网络的可扩展、节能和实时电磁数字孪生提供了一条有前景的技术路径。

Abstract: Accurate and real-time radio map (RM) generation is crucial for
next-generation wireless systems, yet diffusion-based approaches often suffer
from large model sizes, slow iterative denoising, and high inference latency,
which hinder practical deployment. To overcome these limitations, we propose
\textbf{RadioFlow}, a novel flow-matching-based generative framework that
achieves high-fidelity RM generation through single-step efficient sampling.
Unlike conventional diffusion models, RadioFlow learns continuous transport
trajectories between noise and data, enabling both training and inference to be
significantly accelerated while preserving reconstruction accuracy.
Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that RadioFlow achieves state-of-the-art
performance with \textbf{up to 8$\times$ fewer parameters} and \textbf{over
4$\times$ faster inference} compared to the leading diffusion-based baseline
(RadioDiff). This advancement provides a promising pathway toward scalable,
energy-efficient, and real-time electromagnetic digital twins for future 6G
networks. We release the code at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Hybrid-depth框架，通过整合CLIP和DINO基础模型来改进自监督单目深度估计，采用从粗到细的渐进学习策略，在KITTI基准测试中显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前自监督单目深度估计方法由于语义-空间知识提取不足而面临性能限制，需要更好的上下文信息提取方法。

Method: 1) 从CLIP和DINO聚合多粒度特征，在对比语言指导下设计代理任务进行深度感知特征对齐；2) 基于粗特征整合相机姿态信息和像素级语言对齐来细化深度预测，可作为即插即用模块与现有MDE流水线集成。

Result: 在KITTI基准测试中，该方法在所有指标上显著优于最先进方法，并有益于下游任务如BEV感知。

Conclusion: 通过语言指导聚合CLIP的语义上下文和DINO的空间细节，有效解决了特征粒度不匹配问题，显著提升了自监督单目深度估计性能。

Abstract: Current self-supervised monocular depth estimation (MDE) approaches encounter
performance limitations due to insufficient semantic-spatial knowledge
extraction. To address this challenge, we propose Hybrid-depth, a novel
framework that systematically integrates foundation models (e.g., CLIP and
DINO) to extract visual priors and acquire sufficient contextual information
for MDE. Our approach introduces a coarse-to-fine progressive learning
framework: 1) Firstly, we aggregate multi-grained features from CLIP (global
semantics) and DINO (local spatial details) under contrastive language
guidance. A proxy task comparing close-distant image patches is designed to
enforce depth-aware feature alignment using text prompts; 2) Next, building on
the coarse features, we integrate camera pose information and pixel-wise
language alignment to refine depth predictions. This module seamlessly
integrates with existing self-supervised MDE pipelines (e.g., Monodepth2,
ManyDepth) as a plug-and-play depth encoder, enhancing continuous depth
estimation. By aggregating CLIP's semantic context and DINO's spatial details
through language guidance, our method effectively addresses feature granularity
mismatches. Extensive experiments on the KITTI benchmark demonstrate that our
method significantly outperforms SOTA methods across all metrics, which also
indeed benefits downstream tasks like BEV perception. Code is available at

TL;DR: 提出IRCR-Net网络，通过实例感知一致性正则化机制改进病理图像中细胞核实例分割，特别针对密集分布和重叠细胞核，利用形态学先验知识减少伪标签噪声。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 病理图像中细胞核实例分割对肿瘤微环境分析至关重要，但标注数据成本高且稀缺，现有半监督方法在实例级一致性正则化不足，缺乏病理结构先验知识利用，训练中容易引入噪声伪标签。

Method: 提出IRCR-Net网络，包含匹配驱动的实例感知一致性(MIAC)和先验驱动的实例感知一致性(PIAC)机制，利用细胞核形态学先验知识评估伪标签质量，丢弃低质量伪标签，增强高质量预测。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在多个公共数据集上显著提升了半监督细胞核实例分割性能，在某些场景下甚至超过了全监督方法。

Conclusion: IRCR-Net通过实例感知一致性正则化和先验知识利用，有效解决了半监督细胞核分割中的伪标签噪声问题，提升了分割精度。

Abstract: Nuclei instance segmentation in pathological images is crucial for downstream
tasks such as tumor microenvironment analysis. However, the high cost and
scarcity of annotated data limit the applicability of fully supervised methods,
while existing semi-supervised methods fail to adequately regularize
consistency at the instance level, lack leverage of the inherent prior
knowledge of pathological structures, and are prone to introducing noisy
pseudo-labels during training. In this paper, we propose an Instance-Aware
Robust Consistency Regularization Network (IRCR-Net) for accurate
instance-level nuclei segmentation. Specifically, we introduce the
Matching-Driven Instance-Aware Consistency (MIAC) and Prior-Driven
Instance-Aware Consistency (PIAC) mechanisms to refine the nuclei instance
segmentation result of the teacher and student subnetwork, particularly for
densely distributed and overlapping nuclei. We incorporate morphological prior
knowledge of nuclei in pathological images and utilize these priors to assess
the quality of pseudo-labels generated from unlabeled data. Low-quality
pseudo-labels are discarded, while high-quality predictions are enhanced to
reduce pseudo-label noise and benefit the network's robust training.
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly
enhances semi-supervised nuclei instance segmentation performance across
multiple public datasets compared to existing approaches, even surpassing fully
supervised methods in some scenarios.

TL;DR: 提出PPFN网络用于热红外图像增强，通过渐进式提示融合和选择性渐进训练机制，有效处理单一和复合退化问题，在复杂退化场景中性能提升8.76%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有红外图像增强方法主要针对单一退化问题，难以处理耦合退化；而通用增强方法由于成像模型差异，在红外图像上效果有限。

Method: 提出渐进式提示融合网络(PPFN)，基于热成像过程建立提示对，融合对应提示对来调制模型特征；引入选择性渐进训练(SPT)机制逐步优化模型对复合情况的处理。

Result: 方法不仅能去除相机噪声、保留关键结构细节，还能增强热图像整体对比度，在复杂退化场景中性能显著提升8.76%。

Conclusion: PPFN方法在热红外图像增强任务中表现出色，特别是对复合退化问题的处理能力，同时构建了高质量多场景红外基准数据集。

Abstract: We engage in the relatively underexplored task named thermal infrared image
enhancement. Existing infrared image enhancement methods primarily focus on
tackling individual degradations, such as noise, contrast, and blurring, making
it difficult to handle coupled degradations. Meanwhile, all-in-one enhancement
methods, commonly applied to RGB sensors, often demonstrate limited
effectiveness due to the significant differences in imaging models. In sight of
this, we first revisit the imaging mechanism and introduce a Progressive Prompt
Fusion Network (PPFN). Specifically, the PPFN initially establishes prompt
pairs based on the thermal imaging process. For each type of degradation, we
fuse the corresponding prompt pairs to modulate the model's features, providing
adaptive guidance that enables the model to better address specific
degradations under single or multiple conditions. In addition, a Selective
Progressive Training (SPT) mechanism is introduced to gradually refine the
model's handling of composite cases to align the enhancement process, which not
only allows the model to remove camera noise and retain key structural details,
but also enhancing the overall contrast of the thermal image. Furthermore, we
introduce the most high-quality, multi-scenarios infrared benchmark covering a
wide range of scenarios. Extensive experiments substantiate that our approach
not only delivers promising visual results under specific degradation but also
significantly improves performance on complex degradation scenes, achieving a
notable 8.76\% improvement. Code is available at

Motivation: 传统多模态方法在处理缺失和未见场景时存在显著局限性，且现有基准测试因训练测试重叠度高而高估了模型能力。

Method: 采用视觉语言模型，结合零样本、监督微调、Fine-tune-CoT和动态CoT策略，其中动态CoT通过自适应注入CoT数据来解决"过度思考"现象。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验结果表明，所提出的方法具有有效性。

Conclusion: 提出的动态CoT策略能够有效提升视觉语言模型在多模态关键词预测任务中的性能，特别是在复杂推理场景下。

Abstract: Multi-modal keyphrase prediction (MMKP) aims to advance beyond text-only
methods by incorporating multiple modalities of input information to produce a
set of conclusive phrases. Traditional multi-modal approaches have been proven
to have significant limitations in handling the challenging absence and unseen
scenarios. Additionally, we identify shortcomings in existing benchmarks that
overestimate model capability due to significant overlap in training tests. In
this work, we propose leveraging vision-language models (VLMs) for the MMKP
task. Firstly, we use two widely-used strategies, e.g., zero-shot and
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to assess the lower bound performance of VLMs.
Next, to improve the complex reasoning capabilities of VLMs, we adopt
Fine-tune-CoT, which leverages high-quality CoT reasoning data generated by a
teacher model to finetune smaller models. Finally, to address the
"overthinking" phenomenon, we propose a dynamic CoT strategy which adaptively
injects CoT data during training, allowing the model to flexibly leverage its
reasoning capabilities during the inference stage. We evaluate the proposed
strategies on various datasets and the experimental results demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed approaches. The code is available at

TL;DR: BLINK-Twice是一个视觉中心推理基准，专注于从纯视觉内容进行推理，超越了浅层感知，要求细粒度观察和分析推理。它包含七种视觉挑战、自然对抗图像对和标注的推理链，对现有MLLMs构成显著挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有推理基准主要评估基于语言的推理，将视觉输入视为可替换的上下文。为了填补这一空白，作者开发了专注于从视觉内容进行推理的基准，将重点从语言基础推理转向图像基础推理。

Method: BLINK-Twice整合了三个核心组件：七种视觉挑战类型用于测试视觉推理，自然对抗图像对强制依赖视觉内容，标注的推理链用于细粒度评估推理过程而非仅最终答案。评估了20个领先的MLLMs，包括12个基础模型和8个推理增强模型。

Result: BLINK-Twice对当前模型构成显著挑战。现有语言空间的推理策略（如思维链或自我批评）可以提升性能，但往往导致不稳定和冗余的推理。重复图像观察能提高模型性能，像o3这样的模型展示的主动视觉交互突显了视觉推理新范式的需求。

Conclusion: 该基准突出了当前MLLMs在视觉推理方面的局限性，并表明需要新的视觉推理范式，特别是主动视觉交互和重复观察的方法。数据集已公开可用。

Abstract: Recently, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have made rapid progress,
particularly in enhancing their reasoning capabilities. However, existing
reasoning benchmarks still primarily assess language-based reasoning, often
treating visual input as replaceable context. To address this gap, we introduce
BLINK-Twice, a vision-centric reasoning benchmark grounded in challenging
perceptual tasks. Instead of relying on external knowledge, our tasks require
models to reason from visual content alone, shifting the focus from
language-based to image-grounded reasoning. Compared to prior perception
benchmarks, it moves beyond shallow perception ("see") and requires
fine-grained observation and analytical reasoning ("observe"). BLINK-Twice
integrates three core components: seven types of visual challenges for testing
visual reasoning, natural adversarial image pairs that enforce reliance on
visual content, and annotated reasoning chains for fine-grained evaluation of
the reasoning process rather than final answers alone. We evaluate 20 leading
MLLMs, including 12 foundation models and 8 reasoning-enhanced models.
BLINK-Twice poses a significant challenge to current models. While existing
reasoning strategies in the language space-such as chain-of-thought or
self-criticism can improve performance, they often result in unstable and
redundant reasoning. We observe that repeated image observation improves
performance across models, and active visual interaction, as demonstrated by
models like o3, highlights the need for a new paradigm for vision reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统3D高斯泼溅方法严重依赖初始点云质量，在城市等无边界动态环境中，由于观察视锥重叠不足，导致点云覆盖不均匀不完整，训练时会产生失真和伪影。现有方法无法重建缺失结构。

Method: 1. 基于体素的可见性推理识别不可靠几何结构；2. 多样性感知视图选择筛选信息丰富的支持视图；3. 基于块匹配的多视图立体重建恢复缺失结构；4. 在缺乏初始点的区域生成新的高斯基元。

Result: 在Waymo和nuScenes数据集上的大量实验表明，VAD-GS优于最先进的3DGS方法，显著提高了静态和动态物体重建几何的质量。

Conclusion: VAD-GS通过可靠的几何先验指导生成新的高斯基元，有效解决了3DGS在点云初始化不完整时的几何恢复问题，特别适用于具有挑战性的城市场景。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated impressive performance in
synthesizing high-fidelity novel views. Nonetheless, its effectiveness
critically depends on the quality of the initialized point cloud. Specifically,
achieving uniform and complete point coverage over the underlying scene
structure requires overlapping observation frustums, an assumption that is
often violated in unbounded, dynamic urban environments. Training Gaussian
models with partially initialized point clouds often leads to distortions and
artifacts, as camera rays may fail to intersect valid surfaces, resulting in
incorrect gradient propagation to Gaussian primitives associated with occluded
or invisible geometry. Additionally, existing densification strategies simply
clone and split Gaussian primitives from existing ones, incapable of
reconstructing missing structures. To address these limitations, we propose
VAD-GS, a 3DGS framework tailored for geometry recovery in challenging urban
scenes. Our method identifies unreliable geometry structures via voxel-based
visibility reasoning, selects informative supporting views through
diversity-aware view selection, and recovers missing structures via patch
matching-based multi-view stereo reconstruction. This design enables the
generation of new Gaussian primitives guided by reliable geometric priors, even
in regions lacking initial points. Extensive experiments on the Waymo and
nuScenes datasets demonstrate that VAD-GS outperforms state-of-the-art 3DGS
approaches and significantly improves the quality of reconstructed geometry for
both static and dynamic objects. Source code will be released upon publication.

Motivation: 准确量化森林生物量对碳循环监测至关重要。虽然机载LiDAR能捕捉3D森林结构，但由于难以建模长程依赖关系来区分树木，直接从点云估计木质体积和地上生物量具有挑战性。

Method: 将Mamba模型的选择性状态空间模型集成到Minkowski网络中，有效编码全局上下文和长程依赖关系以改进树木区分。引入跳跃连接来增强特征并加速收敛。

Conclusion: 该工作为大规模森林生物量分析提供了强大工具，推进了基于LiDAR的森林清查。

Abstract: Accurate forest biomass quantification is vital for carbon cycle monitoring.
While airborne LiDAR excels at capturing 3D forest structure, directly
estimating woody volume and Aboveground Biomass (AGB) from point clouds is
challenging due to difficulties in modeling long-range dependencies needed to
distinguish trees.We propose Minkowski-MambaNet, a novel deep learning
framework that directly estimates volume and AGB from raw LiDAR. Its key
innovation is integrating the Mamba model's Selective State Space Model (SSM)
into a Minkowski network, enabling effective encoding of global context and
long-range dependencies for improved tree differentiation. Skip connections are
incorporated to enhance features and accelerate convergence.Evaluated on Danish
National Forest Inventory LiDAR data, Minkowski-MambaNet significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art methods, providing more accurate and robust
estimates. Crucially, it requires no Digital Terrain Model (DTM) and is robust
to boundary artifacts. This work offers a powerful tool for large-scale forest
biomass analysis, advancing LiDAR-based forest inventories.

Motivation: 基于transformer的模型在视觉任务（如目标检测）中的推理效率仍然是一个挑战，需要利用DETR中MLP层固有的稀疏性来提升效率。

Method: 1. SIBS：基于固定激活模式的启发式方法预测神经元不活跃性；2. MGS：在预训练DETR上训练的轻量级门控机制，使用小型线性层预测动态稀疏性。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种实用、输入自适应的稀疏化方法，无需完整模型重新训练即可实现预训练视觉transformer的高效部署。

Abstract: Efficient inference with transformer-based models remains a challenge,
especially in vision tasks like object detection. We analyze the inherent
sparsity in the MLP layers of DETR and introduce two methods to exploit it
without retraining. First, we propose Static Indicator-Based Sparsification
(SIBS), a heuristic method that predicts neuron inactivity based on fixed
activation patterns. While simple, SIBS offers limited gains due to the
input-dependent nature of sparsity. To address this, we introduce Micro-Gated
Sparsification (MGS), a lightweight gating mechanism trained on top of a
pretrained DETR. MGS predicts dynamic sparsity using a small linear layer and
achieves up to 85 to 95% activation sparsity. Experiments on the COCO dataset
show that MGS maintains or even improves performance while significantly
reducing computation. Our method offers a practical, input-adaptive approach to
sparsification, enabling efficient deployment of pretrained vision transformers
without full model retraining.

Conclusion: Mono4DEditor提供了一个灵活准确的4D场景文本驱动编辑框架，通过语言嵌入表示和精确定位策略，成功解决了动态场景中语义精确编辑的挑战。

Abstract: Editing 4D scenes reconstructed from monocular videos based on text prompts
is a valuable yet challenging task with broad applications in content creation
and virtual environments. The key difficulty lies in achieving semantically
precise edits in localized regions of complex, dynamic scenes, while preserving
the integrity of unedited content. To address this, we introduce Mono4DEditor,
a novel framework for flexible and accurate text-driven 4D scene editing. Our
method augments 3D Gaussians with quantized CLIP features to form a
language-embedded dynamic representation, enabling efficient semantic querying
of arbitrary spatial regions. We further propose a two-stage point-level
localization strategy that first selects candidate Gaussians via CLIP
similarity and then refines their spatial extent to improve accuracy. Finally,
targeted edits are performed on localized regions using a diffusion-based video
editing model, with flow and scribble guidance ensuring spatial fidelity and
temporal coherence. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Mono4DEditor enables
high-quality, text-driven edits across diverse scenes and object types, while
preserving the appearance and geometry of unedited areas and surpassing prior
approaches in both flexibility and visual fidelity.

Abstract: Low-light video enhancement (LLVE) is challenging due to noise, low contrast,
and color degradations. Learning-based approaches offer fast inference but
still struggle with heavy noise in real low-light scenes, primarily due to
limitations in effectively leveraging temporal information. In this paper, we
address this issue with DWTA-Net, a novel two-stage framework that jointly
exploits short- and long-term temporal cues. Stage I employs Visual State-Space
blocks for multi-frame alignment, recovering brightness, color, and structure
with local consistency. Stage II introduces a recurrent refinement module with
dynamic weight-based temporal aggregation guided by optical flow, adaptively
balancing static and dynamic regions. A texture-adaptive loss further preserves
fine details while promoting smoothness in flat areas. Experiments on
real-world low-light videos show that DWTA-Net effectively suppresses noise and
artifacts, delivering superior visual quality compared with state-of-the-art
methods.

TL;DR: 提出了SilvaScenes数据集，用于从林下图像进行树种实例分割，包含1476棵树的24个物种标注，在五个生物气候域收集。基准测试显示树分割相对容易（mAP 67.65%），但物种分类仍具挑战性（mAP 35.69%）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 森林管理机器人面临复杂自然环境感知挑战，现有数据集多关注城市环境或物种有限，无法满足精准林业、生物多样性监测和林业设备自动化对高级感知能力的需求。

Method: 在加拿大魁北克五个生物气候域收集林下图像数据，由林业专家标注1476棵树24个物种，构建SilvaScenes数据集，并使用现代深度学习实例分割方法进行基准测试。

Result: 树分割任务表现良好，最高平均精度达67.65%，但物种分类任务极具挑战性，平均精度仅为35.69%。

Conclusion: SilvaScenes数据集填补了森林环境感知数据集的空白，为开发复杂自然环境中树木检测和物种分类系统提供了重要资源，但树种分类仍是需要进一步研究的挑战性问题。

Abstract: Interest in robotics for forest management is growing, but perception in
complex, natural environments remains a significant hurdle. Conditions such as
heavy occlusion, variable lighting, and dense vegetation pose challenges to
automated systems, which are essential for precision forestry, biodiversity
monitoring, and the automation of forestry equipment. These tasks rely on
advanced perceptual capabilities, such as detection and fine-grained species
classification of individual trees. Yet, existing datasets are inadequate to
develop such perception systems, as they often focus on urban settings or a
limited number of species. To address this, we present SilvaScenes, a new
dataset for instance segmentation of tree species from under-canopy images.
Collected across five bioclimatic domains in Quebec, Canada, SilvaScenes
features 1476 trees from 24 species with annotations from forestry experts. We
demonstrate the relevance and challenging nature of our dataset by benchmarking
modern deep learning approaches for instance segmentation. Our results show
that, while tree segmentation is easy, with a top mean average precision (mAP)
of 67.65%, species classification remains a significant challenge with an mAP
of only 35.69%. Our dataset and source code will be available at

TL;DR: 提出维度熵最大化方法，通过正则化文本特征分布来缓解对比视觉语言模型中主导维度的影响，改善测试时提示调优的校准性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对比视觉语言模型存在由跨模态单一主导特征维度引起的模态间隙问题，这些主导维度具有高预测敏感性，限制其影响可以改善校准误差。

Method: 提出维度熵最大化方法，通过正则化文本特征分布使其趋向均匀分布，从而减轻对主导维度的依赖。

Result: 该方法缓解了测试时提示调优中校准性能的退化，为实际部署场景中视觉语言模型的可靠性提供了简单有效的解决方案。

Conclusion: 维度熵最大化方法能够有效改善视觉语言模型在测试时适应中的校准性能，增强模型在实际应用中的可靠性。

Abstract: Test-time adaptation paradigm provides flexibility towards domain shifts by
performing immediate adaptation on unlabeled target data from the source model.
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) leverage their generalization capabilities for
diverse downstream tasks, and test-time prompt tuning has emerged as a
prominent solution for adapting VLMs. In this work, we explore contrastive VLMs
and identify the modality gap caused by a single dominant feature dimension
across modalities. We observe that the dominant dimensions in both text and
image modalities exhibit high predictive sensitivity, and that constraining
their influence can improve calibration error. Building on this insight, we
propose dimensional entropy maximization that regularizes the distribution of
textual features toward uniformity to mitigate the dependency of dominant
dimensions. Our method alleviates the degradation of calibration performance in
test-time prompt tuning, offering a simple yet effective solution to enhance
the reliability of VLMs in real-world deployment scenarios.

Motivation: 解决动画和游戏产业中从少量人类设计角色生成无限新颖角色的问题，同时保持艺术风格和视觉特征的连续性，扩展创意可能性。

Method: 基于DreamBooth微调文本到图像扩散模型，采用多令牌策略（通过聚类为单个角色和集体风格分配独立令牌），结合LoRA参数高效微调，移除类别特定正则化集，在生成时引入随机令牌和嵌入。

Result: 在五个小型专业数据集上的评估显示，该方法能生成高质量、多样化的角色，同时保持参考角色的独特美学特征，人类评估进一步证实了其有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法成功实现了从少量参考角色生成无限新角色的目标，同时保持艺术风格一致性，展现了在动画和游戏领域的应用潜力。

Abstract: The audiovisual industry is undergoing a profound transformation as it is
integrating AI developments not only to automate routine tasks but also to
inspire new forms of art. This paper addresses the problem of producing a
virtually unlimited number of novel characters that preserve the artistic style
and shared visual traits of a small set of human-designed reference characters,
thus broadening creative possibilities in animation, gaming, and related
domains. Our solution builds upon DreamBooth, a well-established fine-tuning
technique for text-to-image diffusion models, and adapts it to tackle two core
challenges: capturing intricate character details beyond textual prompts and
the few-shot nature of the training data. To achieve this, we propose a
multi-token strategy, using clustering to assign separate tokens to individual
characters and their collective style, combined with LoRA-based
parameter-efficient fine-tuning. By removing the class-specific regularization
set and introducing random tokens and embeddings during generation, our
approach allows for unlimited character creation while preserving the learned
style. We evaluate our method on five small specialized datasets, comparing it
to relevant baselines using both quantitative metrics and a human evaluation
study. Our results demonstrate that our approach produces high-quality, diverse
characters while preserving the distinctive aesthetic features of the reference
characters, with human evaluation further reinforcing its effectiveness and
highlighting the potential of our method.

Method: 提出了临床基础的方法论来定义评估任务和指标，构建了软件框架用于标准化评估流程，并在异构复杂任务上评估了最先进的算法。

Result: 发现最小化用户交互信息损失对模型鲁棒性至关重要，自适应缩放机制能提升鲁棒性和收敛速度，验证与训练提示行为不一致会导致性能下降，2D方法在板状图像和粗糙目标上表现良好但3D上下文对大型或不规则目标更有帮助，非医学领域模型在对比度差和复杂形状下性能下降。

Conclusion: 建立标准化临床评估框架对于准确评估交互式医学图像分割算法的真实性能至关重要，揭示了多个影响算法性能的关键因素。

Abstract: Interactive segmentation is a promising strategy for building robust,
generalisable algorithms for volumetric medical image segmentation. However,
inconsistent and clinically unrealistic evaluation hinders fair comparison and
misrepresents real-world performance. We propose a clinically grounded
methodology for defining evaluation tasks and metrics, and built a software
framework for constructing standardised evaluation pipelines. We evaluate
state-of-the-art algorithms across heterogeneous and complex tasks and observe
that (i) minimising information loss when processing user interactions is
critical for model robustness, (ii) adaptive-zooming mechanisms boost
robustness and speed convergence, (iii) performance drops if validation
prompting behaviour/budgets differ from training, (iv) 2D methods perform well
with slab-like images and coarse targets, but 3D context helps with large or
irregularly shaped targets, (v) performance of non-medical-domain models (e.g.
SAM2) degrades with poor contrast and complex shapes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工具使用是人类智能的重要体现，但现有MLLM在物理工具理解方面的能力尚未得到量化评估，需要专门的基准来填补这一空白。

Method: 构建包含1000+图像-文本对的VQA数据集，分为工具识别、工具理解和工具创造三个难度级别，评估32个MLLM模型的表现。

Result: 对32个MLLM的全面评估显示，模型在工具理解方面存在显著缺陷，特别是在工具创造任务上表现不佳。

Conclusion: 当前MLLM在物理工具理解方面仍有很大提升空间，需要进一步研究来增强模型对物理世界的理解能力。

Abstract: The ability to use, understand, and create tools is a hallmark of human
intelligence, enabling sophisticated interaction with the physical world. For
any general-purpose intelligent agent to achieve true versatility, it must also
master these fundamental skills. While modern Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs) leverage their extensive common knowledge for high-level planning in
embodied AI and in downstream Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, the extent
of their true understanding of physical tools remains unquantified. To bridge
this gap, we present PhysToolBench, the first benchmark dedicated to evaluating
the comprehension of physical tools by MLLMs. Our benchmark is structured as a
Visual Question Answering (VQA) dataset comprising over 1,000 image-text pairs.
It assesses capabilities across three distinct difficulty levels: (1) Tool
Recognition: Requiring the recognition of a tool's primary function. (2) Tool
Understanding: Testing the ability to grasp the underlying principles of a
tool's operation. (3) Tool Creation: Challenging the model to fashion a new
tool from surrounding objects when conventional options are unavailable. Our
comprehensive evaluation of 32 MLLMs-spanning proprietary, open-source,
specialized embodied, and backbones in VLAs-reveals a significant deficiency in
tool understanding. Furthermore, we provide an in-depth analysis and propose
preliminary solutions. Code and dataset are publicly available.

Motivation: 研究三星智能手机图像中存在的对角线伪影及其对PRNU相机源验证的影响，特别是在不同型号间的指纹碰撞问题。

Method: 分析多个三星Galaxy系列手机的图像，比较普通图像和PRO模式原始图像的差异，研究伪影对PRNU验证的影响。

Result: 发现某些Galaxy S和A系列型号存在共同的伪影模式，导致指纹碰撞；PRO模式原始图像可可靠进行PRNU验证；伪影可用于减少HDR图像误检和定位人像模式中的合成虚化区域。

Conclusion: 对角线伪影会影响PRNU验证，但原始图像可解决此问题；这些伪影在法证分析中具有应用价值，特别是在无法获取原始图像的情况下。

Abstract: We investigate diagonal artifacts present in images captured by several
Samsung smartphones and their impact on PRNU-based camera source verification.
We first show that certain Galaxy S series models share a common pattern
causing fingerprint collisions, with a similar issue also found in some Galaxy
A models. Next, we demonstrate that reliable PRNU verification remains feasible
for devices supporting PRO mode with raw capture, since raw images bypass the
processing pipeline that introduces artifacts. This option, however, is not
available for the mid-range A series models or in forensic cases without access
to raw images. Finally, we outline potential forensic applications of the
diagonal artifacts, such as reducing misdetections in HDR images and localizing
regions affected by synthetic bokeh in portrait-mode images.

TL;DR: PRNet是一个实时检测框架，通过保留和有效利用原始浅层空间特征来增强小目标表示，在计算约束下实现了优越的准确率-效率权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 航空图像中的小目标检测由于像素表示有限，在特征提取过程中存在严重的信息退化问题，浅层空间细节无法与语义信息有效对齐，导致频繁漏检和误检。

Method: 提出PRNet框架，包含两个模块：渐进细化颈部(PRN)通过骨干网络重用和迭代细化实现空间-语义对齐；增强切片采样(ESSamp)通过优化重排和卷积在降采样过程中保留浅层信息。

Result: 在VisDrone、AI-TOD和UAVDT数据集上的广泛实验表明，PRNet在可比较的计算约束下优于最先进的方法。

Conclusion: PRNet通过优先保留和利用原始浅层空间特征，有效解决了小目标检测中的信息退化问题，实现了更好的检测性能。

Abstract: Small object detection in aerial images suffers from severe information
degradation during feature extraction due to limited pixel representations,
where shallow spatial details fail to align effectively with semantic
information, leading to frequent misses and false positives. Existing FPN-based
methods attempt to mitigate these losses through post-processing enhancements,
but the reconstructed details often deviate from the original image
information, impeding their fusion with semantic content. To address this
limitation, we propose PRNet, a real-time detection framework that prioritizes
the preservation and efficient utilization of primitive shallow spatial
features to enhance small object representations. PRNet achieves this via two
modules:the Progressive Refinement Neck (PRN) for spatial-semantic alignment
through backbone reuse and iterative refinement, and the Enhanced SliceSamp
(ESSamp) for preserving shallow information during downsampling via optimized
rearrangement and convolution. Extensive experiments on the VisDrone, AI-TOD,
and UAVDT datasets demonstrate that PRNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods
under comparable computational constraints, achieving superior
accuracy-efficiency trade-offs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多层感知机(MLP)作为隐式神经表示(INR)进行变形建模时，通常依赖昂贵的正则化，导致训练不稳定且难以有效对齐特征。

Method: 将变形重新构建为微分向量流的构造，通过将结构流属性直接编码到网络架构中，确保连续性、可逆性和时间一致性。

Result: 在面部和图像变形、高斯泼溅变形等应用中，FLOWING实现了最先进的变形质量，且收敛速度更快。

Conclusion: 基于流的方法能够产生原理性且稳定的变换，实现准确且结构保持的变形。

Abstract: Morphing is a long-standing problem in vision and computer graphics,
requiring a time-dependent warping for feature alignment and a blending for
smooth interpolation. Recently, multilayer perceptrons (MLPs) have been
explored as implicit neural representations (INRs) for modeling such
deformations, due to their meshlessness and differentiability; however,
extracting coherent and accurate morphings from standard MLPs typically relies
on costly regularizations, which often lead to unstable training and prevent
effective feature alignment. To overcome these limitations, we propose FLOWING
(FLOW morphING), a framework that recasts warping as the construction of a
differential vector flow, naturally ensuring continuity, invertibility, and
temporal coherence by encoding structural flow properties directly into the
network architectures. This flow-centric approach yields principled and stable
transformations, enabling accurate and structure-preserving morphing of both 2D
images and 3D shapes. Extensive experiments across a range of applications -
including face and image morphing, as well as Gaussian Splatting morphing -
show that FLOWING achieves state-of-the-art morphing quality with faster
convergence. Code and pretrained models are available at

TL;DR: TC-LoRA是一种新的可控扩散模型范式，通过超网络实时生成LoRA适配器，在扩散过程的每个步骤中动态调整模型权重，实现自适应条件控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的可控扩散模型使用静态架构修改中间激活来注入条件指导，这种固定策略无法适应多阶段去噪过程的动态特性，限制了模型从粗结构到细细节的适应能力。

Method: 提出TC-LoRA框架，使用超网络基于时间和用户条件实时生成LoRA适配器，直接条件化模型权重，实现动态、上下文感知的控制。

Result: 在多个数据域的实验表明，这种动态参数控制相比静态激活方法显著提高了生成保真度和空间条件遵循能力。

Conclusion: TC-LoRA通过更深入的功能性权重适应修改模型的调节策略，使控制能够与任务和生成阶段的动态需求保持一致，建立了替代方法。

Abstract: Current controllable diffusion models typically rely on fixed architectures
that modify intermediate activations to inject guidance conditioned on a new
modality. This approach uses a static conditioning strategy for a dynamic,
multi-stage denoising process, limiting the model's ability to adapt its
response as the generation evolves from coarse structure to fine detail. We
introduce TC-LoRA (Temporally Modulated Conditional LoRA), a new paradigm that
enables dynamic, context-aware control by conditioning the model's weights
directly. Our framework uses a hypernetwork to generate LoRA adapters
on-the-fly, tailoring weight modifications for the frozen backbone at each
diffusion step based on time and the user's condition. This mechanism enables
the model to learn and execute an explicit, adaptive strategy for applying
conditional guidance throughout the entire generation process. Through
experiments on various data domains, we demonstrate that this dynamic,
parametric control significantly enhances generative fidelity and adherence to
spatial conditions compared to static, activation-based methods. TC-LoRA
establishes an alternative approach in which the model's conditioning strategy
is modified through a deeper functional adaptation of its weights, allowing
control to align with the dynamic demands of the task and generative stage.

Motivation: 生物医学目标检测面临标注数据稀缺和新类别频繁出现的挑战，需要能够处理少样本、开放集和跨任务泛化的统一解决方案。

Method: 基于类别无关的DETR骨干网络，从原始支持图像构建类别原型，使用增强视图和轻量级transformer解码器学习嵌入空间，联合优化原型匹配损失、对齐分离损失和KL散度正则化。

Conclusion: FSP-DETR提供了一个统一的框架，能够在推理时灵活支持未见类别识别、背景拒绝和跨任务适应，无需重新训练，为生物医学检测提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Object detection in biomedical settings is fundamentally constrained by the
scarcity of labeled data and the frequent emergence of novel or rare
categories. We present FSP-DETR, a unified detection framework that enables
robust few-shot detection, open-set recognition, and generalization to unseen
biomedical tasks within a single model. Built upon a class-agnostic DETR
backbone, our approach constructs class prototypes from original support images
and learns an embedding space using augmented views and a lightweight
transformer decoder. Training jointly optimizes a prototype matching loss, an
alignment-based separation loss, and a KL divergence regularization to improve
discriminative feature learning and calibration under scarce supervision.
Unlike prior work that tackles these tasks in isolation, FSP-DETR enables
inference-time flexibility to support unseen class recognition, background
rejection, and cross-task adaptation without retraining. We also introduce a
new ova species detection benchmark with 20 parasite classes and establish
standardized evaluation protocols. Extensive experiments across ova, blood
cell, and malaria detection tasks demonstrate that FSP-DETR significantly
outperforms prior few-shot and prototype-based detectors, especially in
low-shot and open-set scenarios.

Abstract: We present a transparent, reproducible measurement of research trends across
26,104 accepted papers from CVPR, ICLR, and NeurIPS spanning 2023-2025. Titles
and abstracts are normalized, phrase-protected, and matched against a
hand-crafted lexicon to assign up to 35 topical labels and mine fine-grained
cues about tasks, architectures, training regimes, objectives, datasets, and
co-mentioned modalities. The analysis quantifies three macro shifts: (1) a
sharp rise of multimodal vision-language-LLM work, which increasingly reframes
classic perception as instruction following and multi-step reasoning; (2)
steady expansion of generative methods, with diffusion research consolidating
around controllability, distillation, and speed; and (3) resilient 3D and video
activity, with composition moving from NeRFs to Gaussian splatting and a
growing emphasis on human- and agent-centric understanding. Within VLMs,
parameter-efficient adaptation like prompting/adapters/LoRA and lightweight
vision-language bridges dominate; training practice shifts from building
encoders from scratch to instruction tuning and finetuning strong backbones;
contrastive objectives recede relative to cross-entropy/ranking and
distillation. Cross-venue comparisons show CVPR has a stronger 3D footprint and
ICLR the highest VLM share, while reliability themes such as efficiency or
robustness diffuse across areas. We release the lexicon and methodology to
enable auditing and extension. Limitations include lexicon recall and
abstract-only scope, but the longitudinal signals are consistent across venues
and years.

Abstract: With the current surge in spatial reasoning explorations, researchers have
made significant progress in understanding indoor scenes, but still struggle
with diverse applications such as robotics and autonomous driving. This paper
aims to advance all-scale spatial reasoning across diverse scenarios by
tackling two key challenges: 1) the heavy reliance on indoor 3D scans and
labor-intensive manual annotations for dataset curation; 2) the absence of
effective all-scale scene modeling, which often leads to overfitting to
individual scenes. In this paper, we introduce a holistic solution that
integrates a structured spatial reasoning knowledge system, scale-aware
modeling, and a progressive training paradigm, as the first attempt to broaden
the all-scale spatial intelligence of MLLMs to the best of our knowledge. Using
a task-specific, specialist-driven automated pipeline, we curate over 38K video
scenes across 5 spatial scales to create SpaceVista-1M, a dataset comprising
approximately 1M spatial QA pairs spanning 19 diverse task types. While
specialist models can inject useful domain knowledge, they are not reliable for
evaluation. We then build an all-scale benchmark with precise annotations by
manually recording, retrieving, and assembling video-based data. However, naive
training with SpaceVista-1M often yields suboptimal results due to the
potential knowledge conflict. Accordingly, we introduce SpaceVista-7B, a
spatial reasoning model that accepts dense inputs beyond semantics and uses
scale as an anchor for scale-aware experts and progressive rewards. Finally,
extensive evaluations across 5 benchmarks, including our SpaceVista-Bench,
demonstrate competitive performance, showcasing strong generalization across
all scales and scenarios. Our dataset, model, and benchmark will be released on
https://peiwensun2000.github.io/mm2km .

Motivation: 视觉语言动作模型虽然提升了机器人操作的泛化能力，但从头训练成本高昂。本文旨在通过知识蒸馏方法，在保留VLM原有结构的基础上，为其添加动作执行能力。

Method: 采用两阶段训练策略：1) 轻量级对齐，将VLM隐藏状态映射到小型动作模型的动作空间；2) 选择性微调语言模型、状态编码器和动作模块。添加动作token和状态编码器来整合物理输入。

Result: 在LIBERO数据集上达到97.3%平均成功率（提升11.8%），在LIBERO-LONG上达到93.5%（提升24.5%）。真实世界实验中，在五个操作任务上达到82.0%成功率（提升17%）。

Conclusion: 动作蒸馏方法有效使VLM能够生成精确动作，同时大幅降低训练成本，在仿真和真实世界任务中都显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Vision-Language Action (VLA) models significantly advance robotic
manipulation by leveraging the strong perception capabilities of pretrained
vision-language models (VLMs). By integrating action modules into these
pretrained models, VLA methods exhibit improved generalization. However,
training them from scratch is costly. In this work, we propose a simple yet
effective distillation-based framework that equips VLMs with action-execution
capability by transferring knowledge from pretrained small action models. Our
architecture retains the original VLM structure, adding only an action token
and a state encoder to incorporate physical inputs. To distill action
knowledge, we adopt a two-stage training strategy. First, we perform
lightweight alignment by mapping VLM hidden states into the action space of the
small action model, enabling effective reuse of its pretrained action decoder
and avoiding expensive pretraining. Second, we selectively fine-tune the
language model, state encoder, and action modules, enabling the system to
integrate multimodal inputs with precise action generation. Specifically, the
action token provides the VLM with a direct handle for predicting future
actions, while the state encoder allows the model to incorporate robot dynamics
not captured by vision alone. This design yields substantial efficiency gains
over training large VLA models from scratch. Compared with previous
state-of-the-art methods, our method achieves 97.3% average success rate on

real-world experiments across five manipulation tasks, our method consistently
outperforms the teacher model, achieving 82.0% success rate (17% improvement),
which demonstrate that action distillation effectively enables VLMs to generate
precise actions while substantially reducing training costs.

TL;DR: StreamingVLM是一个专为实时理解无限视觉输入设计的视觉语言模型，通过统一的训练-推理对齐框架，在保持紧凑KV缓存的同时实现稳定的实时性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在处理无限视频流时面临计算成本高、延迟大和内存使用过多的问题，需要一种能够实时稳定理解长视频的方法。

Method: 采用统一的训练-推理对齐框架，在推理时维护紧凑的KV缓存（重用注意力sink状态、近期视觉token短窗口和文本token长窗口），通过简单的监督微调策略在短重叠视频块上应用完整注意力来模拟推理时注意力模式。

Result: 在Inf-Streams-Eval基准测试中达到66.18%胜率对抗GPT-4O mini，在单张NVIDIA H100上保持高达8 FPS的稳定实时性能，同时在LongVideoBench和OVOBench Realtime上分别提升+4.30和+5.96。

Conclusion: StreamingVLM成功解决了视觉语言模型处理无限视频流的挑战，实现了实时稳定的性能，且微调策略还能提升通用VQA能力。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) could power real-time assistants and autonomous
agents, but they face a critical challenge: understanding near-infinite video
streams without escalating latency and memory usage. Processing entire videos
with full attention leads to quadratic computational costs and poor performance
on long videos. Meanwhile, simple sliding window methods are also flawed, as
they either break coherence or suffer from high latency due to redundant
recomputation. In this paper, we introduce StreamingVLM, a model designed for
real-time, stable understanding of infinite visual input. Our approach is a
unified framework that aligns training with streaming inference. During
inference, we maintain a compact KV cache by reusing states of attention sinks,
a short window of recent vision tokens, and a long window of recent text
tokens. This streaming ability is instilled via a simple supervised fine-tuning
(SFT) strategy that applies full attention on short, overlapped video chunks,
which effectively mimics the inference-time attention pattern without training
on prohibitively long contexts. For evaluation, we build Inf-Streams-Eval, a
new benchmark with videos averaging over two hours that requires dense,
per-second alignment between frames and text. On Inf-Streams-Eval, StreamingVLM
achieves a 66.18% win rate against GPT-4O mini and maintains stable, real-time
performance at up to 8 FPS on a single NVIDIA H100. Notably, our SFT strategy
also enhances general VQA abilities without any VQA-specific fine-tuning,
improving performance on LongVideoBench by +4.30 and OVOBench Realtime by
+5.96. Code is available at https://github.com/mit-han-lab/streaming-vlm.

TL;DR: 提出了PBR框架，通过在检索前融入用户特定信号来解决个性化查询扩展问题，包含P-PRF和P-Anchor两个组件，在个性化基准测试中表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有查询扩展方法采用统一策略，忽视了用户特定的语义表达风格、偏好和历史上下文，导致在个性化场景下泛化能力受限。

Method: PBR框架包含：P-PRF通过用户历史生成风格对齐的伪反馈来模拟用户表达风格；P-Anchor基于图结构对齐用户语料库以捕捉其语义结构。

Result: 在两个个性化基准测试中，PBR始终优于强基线方法，在PersonaBench上检索器性能提升高达10%。

Conclusion: 在检索前建模个性化能够有效缩小用户自适应RAG系统中的语义鸿沟，证明了个人化建模在检索前阶段的重要性。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) critically depends on effective query
expansion to retrieve relevant information. However, existing expansion methods
adopt uniform strategies that overlook user-specific semantics, ignoring
individual expression styles, preferences, and historical context. In practice,
identical queries in text can express vastly different intentions across users.
This representational rigidity limits the ability of current RAG systems to
generalize effectively in personalized settings. Specifically, we identify two
core challenges for personalization: 1) user expression styles are inherently
diverse, making it difficult for standard expansions to preserve personalized
intent. 2) user corpora induce heterogeneous semantic structures-varying in
topical focus and lexical organization-which hinders the effective anchoring of
expanded queries within the user's corpora space. To address these challenges,
we propose Personalize Before Retrieve (PBR), a framework that incorporates
user-specific signals into query expansion prior to retrieval. PBR consists of
two components: P-PRF, which generates stylistically aligned pseudo feedback
using user history for simulating user expression style, and P-Anchor, which
performs graph-based structure alignment over user corpora to capture its
structure. Together, they produce personalized query representations tailored
for retrieval. Experiments on two personalized benchmarks show that PBR
consistently outperforms strong baselines, with up to 10% gains on PersonaBench
across retrievers. Our findings demonstrate the value of modeling
personalization before retrieval to close the semantic gap in user-adaptive RAG
systems. Our code is available at https://github.com/Zhang-Yingyi/PBR-code.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 提出了SHERLOCK框架，利用大语言模型的推理能力辅助风险调查，通过构建知识库、智能平台和反思优化模块，显著提升风险分析的准确性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电子商务增长加剧了风险管理的挑战，大量案件分析给分析师带来沉重负担，且分析师个体差异阻碍了标准化工作流程的建立。

Method: SHERLOCK框架包含三个核心组件：从多模态数据构建领域知识库、基于数据飞轮范式的智能平台、以及用于快速响应风险模式的反思优化模块。

Result: 在京东真实交易数据集上的实验表明，该方法显著提高了LLM分析结果的事实对齐和风险定位精度，部署后大幅提升了风险调查工作流程效率。

Conclusion: SHERLOCK框架成功解决了风险管理中的效率和标准化问题，通过LLM推理能力与领域知识的结合，为电商风险调查提供了有效的自动化解决方案。

Abstract: The growth of the e-commerce industry has intensified the adversarial
dynamics between shadow economy actors and risk management teams. Companies
often conduct risk investigations into suspicious cases to identify emerging
fraud patterns, thereby enhancing both preemptive risk prevention and post-hoc
governance. However, the sheer volume of case analyses imposes a substantial
workload on risk management analysts, as each case requires the integration of
long-term expert experience and meticulous scrutiny across multiple risk
dimensions. Additionally, individual disparities among analysts hinder the
establishment of uniform and high-standard workflows. To address these
challenges, we propose the SHERLOCK framework, which leverages the reasoning
capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to assist analysts in risk
investigations. Our approach consists of three primary components: (1)
extracting risk management knowledge from multi-modal data and constructing a
domain knowledge base (KB), (2) building an intelligent platform guided by the
data flywheel paradigm that integrates daily operations, expert annotations,
and model evaluations, with iteratively fine-tuning for preference alignment,
and (3) introducing a Reflect & Refine (R&R) module that collaborates with the
domain KB to establish a rapid response mechanism for evolving risk patterns.
Experiments conducted on the real-world transaction dataset from JD.com
demonstrate that our method significantly improves the precision of both
factual alignment and risk localization within the LLM analysis results.
Deployment of the SHERLOCK-based LLM system on JD.com has substantially
enhanced the efficiency of case investigation workflows for risk managers.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 近期研究开始将显式思维链推理引入基于LLM的重排序器，但推理在排序任务中的有效性尚未得到充分探索。本研究旨在系统评估推理在重排序中的实际效果。

Method: 在点式和列表式设置下，分别使用监督微调和强化学习，在多样化基准（包括推理密集型数据集BRIGHT和标准IR基准BEIR）上比较推理增强重排序器与直接预测模型的表现。

Result: 推理增强的重排序器在所有设置下均表现不如直接预测排名的模型，存在三个核心局限：点式重排序中推理破坏校准并偏向正类；列表式重排序中推理提高域内拟合但增加方差且泛化能力差；直接微调的重排序器更稳定有效。

Conclusion: 显式推理并非普遍有益于重排序任务，未来研究方向包括点式重排序的校准感知评分和设计简洁、有针对性的推理策略以减轻列表式重排序中的过拟合和过度思考问题。

Abstract: Document reranking is a key component in information retrieval (IR), aimed at
refining initial retrieval results to improve ranking quality for downstream
tasks. Recent studies--motivated by large reasoning models (LRMs)--have begun
incorporating explicit chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning into LLM-based
rerankers. However, the effectiveness of such reasoning for ranking tasks
remains underexplored. In this work, we present the first systematic study of
reasoning in reranking across both pointwise and listwise settings, under both
supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning. Using diverse benchmarks,
including reasoning-intensive datasets (BRIGHT) and standard IR benchmarks
(BEIR), we find that reasoning-augmented rerankers consistently underperform
their direct counterparts that predict rankings without CoT, despite
substantially higher inference costs. Our analysis reveals three core
limitations: (i) in pointwise rerankers, reasoning breaks calibration and
biases models toward the positive class, raising TPR but lowering TNR, which
inflates false positives and degrades ranking in negative-dominant pools; (ii)
in listwise rerankers, reasoning improves in-domain fit but increases variance
and fails to generalize out-of-domain, even when reinforcement learning
shortens rationales; and (iii) overall, directly fine-tuned rerankers remain
more stable, effective, and robust. These findings challenge the assumption
that explicit reasoning is universally beneficial for reranking. We conclude by
highlighting future directions, including calibration-aware scoring for
pointwise rerankers and the design of concise, targeted reasoning strategies to
mitigate overfitting and overthinking in listwise rerankers.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 推荐系统中从稀疏用户-物品交互中学习有效嵌入是一个核心挑战。现有对比学习方法中的随机数据增强往往会改变原始语义信息，需要更高质量的增强视图。

Method: 使用深度生成模型近似原始数据分布进行数据增强；提取物品互补矩阵表征物品间潜在相关性；采用融合推荐、数据增强和对比学习的联合目标函数。

Result: 在三个公开数据集上的广泛实验证明了模型优越性。

Conclusion: GDA4Rec框架能够生成高质量增强视图，提供鲁棒的自监督信号，学习更有效和信息丰富的嵌入表示。

Abstract: Recommendation systems have become indispensable in various online platforms,
from e-commerce to streaming services. A fundamental challenge in this domain
is learning effective embeddings from sparse user-item interactions. While
contrastive learning has recently emerged as a promising solution to this
issue, generating augmented views for contrastive learning through most
existing random data augmentation methods often leads to the alteration of
original semantic information. In this paper, we propose a novel framework,
GDA4Rec (Generative Data Augmentation in graph contrastive learning for
Recommendation) to generate high-quality augmented views and provide robust
self-supervised signals. Specifically, we employ a noise generation module that
leverages deep generative models to approximate the distribution of original
data for data augmentation. Additionally, GDA4Rec further extracts an item
complement matrix to characterize the latent correlations between items and
provide additional self-supervised signals. Lastly, a joint objective that
integrates recommendation, data augmentation and contrastive learning is used
to enforce the model to learn more effective and informative embeddings.
Extensive experiments are conducted on three public datasets to demonstrate the
superiority of the model. The code is available at:

Motivation: 传统新闻媒体在采用个性化推荐时面临平衡技术创新与核心编辑价值观的挑战，需要找到既能提升用户体验又能保持新闻专业性的方法。

Method: 在挪威主要传统新闻机构的网站上进行了A/B测试，评估控制式个性化策略的效果，比较个性化内容与传统编辑内容的用户行为差异。

Result: 个性化内容显著提高了点击率，降低了用户导航成本，改善了相关内容发现效率，同时增加了内容多样性和目录覆盖率，减少了流行度偏见。

Conclusion: 控制式个性化能够成功协调用户需求与编辑目标，为传统媒体采用个性化技术同时维护新闻价值观提供了可行路径。

Abstract: Personalized news recommendations have become a standard feature of large
news aggregation services, optimizing user engagement through automated content
selection. In contrast, legacy news media often approach personalization
cautiously, striving to balance technological innovation with core editorial
values. As a result, online platforms of traditional news outlets typically
combine editorially curated content with algorithmically selected articles - a
strategy we term controlled personalization. In this industry paper, we
evaluate the effectiveness of controlled personalization through an A/B test
conducted on the website of a major Norwegian legacy news organization. Our
findings indicate that even a modest level of personalization yields
substantial benefits. Specifically, we observe that users exposed to
personalized content demonstrate higher click-through rates and reduced
navigation effort, suggesting improved discovery of relevant content. Moreover,
our analysis reveals that controlled personalization contributes to greater
content diversity and catalog coverage and in addition reduces popularity bias.
Overall, our results suggest that controlled personalization can successfully
align user needs with editorial goals, offering a viable path for legacy media
to adopt personalization technologies while upholding journalistic values.

Motivation: 现有推荐系统大多优化短期参与度，强化学习方法面临庞大动态动作空间的挑战，导致策略学习不稳定。

Method: 使用语义ID编码物品构建固定语义动作空间，通过分层策略网络进行粗到细的决策，结合多级评论家进行细粒度信用分配。

Conclusion: HSRL为基于强化学习的推荐系统提供了一个可扩展的范式，能有效处理大规模动作空间问题。

Abstract: Recommender Systems (RS) are fundamental to modern online services. While
most existing approaches optimize for short-term engagement, recent work has
begun to explore reinforcement learning (RL) to model long-term user value.
However, these efforts face significant challenges due to the vast, dynamic
action spaces inherent in recommendation, which hinder stable policy learning.
To resolve this bottleneck, we introduce Hierarchical Semantic RL (HSRL), which
reframes RL-based recommendation over a fixed Semantic Action Space (SAS). HSRL
encodes items as Semantic IDs (SIDs) for policy learning, and maps SIDs back to
their original items via a fixed, invertible lookup during execution. To align
decision-making with SID generation, the Hierarchical Policy Network (HPN)
operates in a coarse-to-fine manner, employing hierarchical residual state
modeling to refine each level's context from the previous level's residual,
thereby stabilizing training and reducing representation-decision mismatch. In
parallel, a Multi-level Critic (MLC) provides token-level value estimates,
enabling fine-grained credit assignment. Across public benchmarks and a
large-scale production dataset from a leading Chinese short-video advertising
platform, HSRL consistently surpasses state-of-the-art baselines. In online
deployment over a seven-day A/B testing, it delivers an 18.421% CVR lift with
only a 1.251% increase in cost, supporting HSRL as a scalable paradigm for
RL-based recommendation. Our code is released at

Abstract: Accurately predicting conversion rates (CVR) for low-activity users remains a
fundamental challenge in large-scale e-commerce recommender systems.Existing
approaches face three critical limitations: (i) reliance on noisy and

user groups and enhance CVR prediction for low-activity users.With a
dual-channel architecture designed for robust cross-user knowledge transfer,
ChoirRec comprises three components: (i) a Semantic Group Generation module
that utilizes LLMs to form reliable, cross-activity user clusters, thereby
filtering out noisy signals; (ii) a Group-aware Hierarchical Representation
module that enriches sparse user embeddings with informative group-level priors
to mitigate data insufficiency; and (iii) a Group-aware Multi-granularity
Modual that employs a dual-channel architecture and adaptive fusion mechanism
to ensure effective learning and utilization of group knowledge. We conduct
extensive offline and online experiments on Taobao, a leading industrial-scale

TL;DR: MRMR是首个需要深度推理的专家级多学科多模态检索基准，包含1502个跨23个领域的查询，通过引入多领域挑战、推理密集型任务和图像-文本交错序列，为多模态检索提供了更现实的评估场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有检索基准主要关注单一领域或简单查询，缺乏对多领域专业知识和深度推理能力的评估。MRMR旨在填补这一空白，为多模态检索系统提供更全面、更具挑战性的评估框架。

Method: 构建包含1502个查询的基准数据集，涵盖23个专业领域，查询和文档采用图像-文本交错序列形式。引入矛盾检索新任务，要求模型识别冲突概念。对4类多模态检索系统和14个前沿模型进行广泛评估。

Result: Qwen3-Embedding文本嵌入模型结合LLM生成的图像描述表现最佳，凸显了多模态检索模型的改进空间。最新的多模态模型在专家领域查询中表现尚可，但在推理密集型任务上仍有不足。

Conclusion: MRMR为推进多模态检索在更现实和具有挑战性的场景中发展铺平了道路，揭示了当前模型在深度推理能力方面的局限性，并指明了未来改进方向。

Abstract: We introduce MRMR, the first expert-level multidisciplinary multimodal
retrieval benchmark requiring intensive reasoning. MRMR contains 1,502 queries
spanning 23 domains, with positive documents carefully verified by human
experts. Compared to prior benchmarks, MRMR introduces three key advancements.
First, it challenges retrieval systems across diverse areas of expertise,
enabling fine-grained model comparison across domains. Second, queries are
reasoning-intensive, with images requiring deeper interpretation such as
diagnosing microscopic slides. We further introduce Contradiction Retrieval, a
novel task requiring models to identify conflicting concepts. Finally, queries
and documents are constructed as image-text interleaved sequences. Unlike
earlier benchmarks restricted to single images or unimodal documents, MRMR
offers a realistic setting with multi-image queries and mixed-modality corpus
documents. We conduct an extensive evaluation of 4 categories of multimodal
retrieval systems and 14 frontier models on MRMR. The text embedding model
Qwen3-Embedding with LLM-generated image captions achieves the highest
performance, highlighting substantial room for improving multimodal retrieval
models. Although latest multimodal models such as Ops-MM-Embedding perform
competitively on expert-domain queries, they fall short on reasoning-intensive
tasks. We believe that MRMR paves the way for advancing multimodal retrieval in
more realistic and challenging scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决文档扩展中存在的三个主要问题：不受控生成导致幻觉和冗余查询、从训练域到测试域的泛化能力差、以及查询拼接对稠密检索产生的噪声影响。

Method: 1. 使用无监督主题建模推断文档的潜在主题；2. 通过混合关键词选择为每个文档创建多样且相关的关键词集；3. 引导LLM利用关键词生成查询；4. 采用双索引融合策略隔离文本和查询信号。

Result: 在多个数据集上的广泛实验表明，Doc2Query++在稀疏和稠密检索中都显著优于现有最先进基线，在MAP、nDCG@10和Recall@100等指标上取得了实质性提升。

Conclusion: Doc2Query++通过结构化查询生成和双索引融合策略，有效解决了文档扩展中的关键挑战，在跨域场景下实现了显著的检索性能提升。

Abstract: Document expansion (DE) via query generation tackles vocabulary mismatch in
sparse retrieval, yet faces limitations: uncontrolled generation producing
hallucinated or redundant queries with low diversity; poor generalization from
in-domain training (e.g., MS MARCO) to out-of-domain data like BEIR; and noise
from concatenation harming dense retrieval. While Large Language Models (LLMs)
enable cross-domain query generation, basic prompting lacks control, and
taxonomy-based methods rely on domain-specific structures, limiting
applicability. To address these challenges, we introduce Doc2Query++, a DE
framework that structures query generation by first inferring a document's
latent topics via unsupervised topic modeling for cross-domain applicability,
then using hybrid keyword selection to create a diverse and relevant keyword
set per document. This guides LLM not only to leverage keywords, which ensure
comprehensive topic representation, but also to reduce redundancy through
diverse, relevant terms. To prevent noise from query appending in dense
retrieval, we propose Dual-Index Fusion strategy that isolates text and query
signals, boosting performance in dense settings. Extensive experiments show
Doc2Query++ significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving
substantial gains in MAP, nDCG@10 and Recall@100 across diverse datasets on
both sparse and dense retrieval.

Abstract: Large-scale scientific datasets -- spanning health biobanks, cell atlases,
Earth reanalyses, and more -- create opportunities for exploratory discovery
unconstrained by specific research questions. We term this process hypothesis
hunting: the cumulative search for insight through sustained exploration across
vast and complex hypothesis spaces. To support it, we introduce AScience, a
framework modeling discovery as the interaction of agents, networks, and
evaluation norms, and implement it as ASCollab, a distributed system of
LLM-based research agents with heterogeneous behaviors. These agents
self-organize into evolving networks, continually producing and peer-reviewing
findings under shared standards of evaluation. Experiments show that such
social dynamics enable the accumulation of expert-rated results along the
diversity-quality-novelty frontier, including rediscoveries of established
biomarkers, extensions of known pathways, and proposals of new therapeutic
targets. While wet-lab validation remains indispensable, our experiments on
cancer cohorts demonstrate that socially structured, agentic networks can
sustain exploratory hypothesis hunting at scale.

Motivation: 印度电商市场快速增长，最后一公里配送占运营成本近一半。传统VRP求解器在现实场景中因非结构化地址、不完整地图和计算限制而效果有限。

Method: 使用大语言模型基于策略标准对VRP生成的路由进行批判性评估，生成、标注和评估了400个案例，比较开源和专有LLM的性能。

Result: 开源LLM识别路由问题准确率达79%，专有推理模型可达86%，证明LLM评估可超越传统距离和时间指标。

Conclusion: LLM为基础的VRP路线评估可作为有效且可扩展的评估层，有助于提高成本效率、配送可靠性和可持续性，特别适用于印度等发展中国家。

Abstract: Indias e-commerce market is projected to grow rapidly, with last-mile
delivery accounting for nearly half of operational expenses. Although vehicle
routing problem (VRP) based solvers are widely used for delivery planning,
their effectiveness in real-world scenarios is limited due to unstructured
addresses, incomplete maps, and computational constraints in distance
estimation. This study proposes a framework that employs large language models
(LLMs) to critique VRP-generated routes against policy-based criteria, allowing
logistics operators to evaluate and prioritise more efficient delivery plans.
As a illustration of our approach we generate, annotate and evaluated 400 cases
using large language models. Our study found that open-source LLMs identified
routing issues with 79% accuracy, while proprietary reasoning models achieved
reach upto 86%. The results demonstrate that LLM-based evaluation of
VRP-generated routes can be an effective and scalable layer of evaluation which
goes beyond beyond conventional distance and time based metrics. This has
implications for improving cost efficiency, delivery reliability, and
sustainability in last-mile logistics, especially for developing countries like
India.

Result: 在四个基准测试中导航成功率提升高达30%，轨迹误差显著减少，在未见的TartanDrive数据集上表现出优秀的零样本泛化能力。

Conclusion: UniWM是实现统一、想象力驱动的具身导航的重要进展。

Abstract: Enabling embodied agents to effectively imagine future states is critical for
robust and generalizable visual navigation. Current state-of-the-art
approaches, however, adopt modular architectures that separate navigation
planning from visual world modeling, leading to state-action misalignment and
limited adaptability in novel or dynamic scenarios. To overcome this
fundamental limitation, we propose UniWM, a unified, memory-augmented world
model integrating egocentric visual foresight and planning within a single
multimodal autoregressive backbone. Unlike modular frameworks, UniWM explicitly
grounds action decisions in visually imagined outcomes, ensuring tight
alignment between prediction and control. A hierarchical memory mechanism
further integrates detailed short-term perceptual cues with longer-term
trajectory context, enabling stable, coherent reasoning over extended horizons.
Extensive experiments across four challenging benchmarks (Go Stanford, ReCon,
SCAND, HuRoN) demonstrate that UniWM substantially improves navigation success
rates by up to 30%, significantly reduces trajectory errors compared to strong
baselines, and exhibits impressive zero-shot generalization on the unseen
TartanDrive dataset. These results highlight UniWM as a principled step toward
unified, imagination-driven embodied navigation.

*Pantea Karimi,Dany Rouhana,Pooria Namyar,Siva Kesava Reddy Kakarla,Venkat Arun,Behnaz Arzani*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 通过向LLM展示启发式算法表现不佳的实例、解释原因并针对输入空间特定区域进行专门设计，可以生成比现有技术更鲁棒的启发式算法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有使用LLM设计启发式算法的方法缺乏对算法表现不佳原因的解释和改进建议，导致生成的启发式算法不够鲁棒

Method: 提出三个简单但有效的想法：(1)向LLM展示启发式算法表现不佳的实例；(2)解释这些表现不佳情况的原因；(3)针对输入空间特定区域进行专门设计

Result: 生成的启发式算法在最坏情况下性能比FunSearch好约28倍，平均性能也有所提升，同时保持运行时间不变

Conclusion: 通过向LLM提供表现不佳实例的解释和改进建议，可以显著提升启发式算法的鲁棒性和性能

Abstract: We posit that we can generate more robust and performant heuristics if we
augment approaches using LLMs for heuristic design with tools that explain why
heuristics underperform and suggestions about how to fix them. We find even
simple ideas that (1) expose the LLM to instances where the heuristic
underperforms; (2) explain why they occur; and (3) specialize design to regions
in the input space, can produce more robust algorithms compared to existing
techniques~ -- ~the heuristics we produce have a $\sim28\times$ better
worst-case performance compared to FunSearch, improve average performance, and
maintain the runtime.

*Guangya Wan,Mingyang Ling,Xiaoqi Ren,Rujun Han,Sheng Li,Zizhao Zhang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: COMPASS是一个轻量级分层框架，通过分离战术执行、战略监督和上下文管理来解决LLM代理在长时程任务中的上下文管理瓶颈问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长时程任务需要持续推理和多次工具交互，但LLM代理容易因小错误累积、幻觉或失去连贯性而失败，上下文管理成为主要瓶颈。

Method: 提出COMPASS框架，包含三个专门组件：主代理执行推理和工具使用、元思考者监控进度并发出战略干预、上下文管理器维护简洁相关的进度简报。

Result: 在GAIA、BrowseComp和Humanity's Last Exam三个基准测试中，COMPASS相比单代理和多代理基线准确率提升高达20%。

Conclusion: COMPASS通过分层专业化组件有效解决了长时程任务中的上下文管理问题，并可通过测试时扩展和后训练管道进一步提升性能。

Abstract: Long-horizon tasks that require sustained reasoning and multiple tool
interactions remain challenging for LLM agents: small errors compound across
steps, and even state-of-the-art models often hallucinate or lose coherence. We
identify context management as the central bottleneck -- extended histories
cause agents to overlook critical evidence or become distracted by irrelevant
information, thus failing to replan or reflect from previous mistakes. To
address this, we propose COMPASS (Context-Organized Multi-Agent Planning and
Strategy System), a lightweight hierarchical framework that separates tactical
execution, strategic oversight, and context organization into three specialized
components: (1) a Main Agent that performs reasoning and tool use, (2) a
Meta-Thinker that monitors progress and issues strategic interventions, and (3)
a Context Manager that maintains concise, relevant progress briefs for
different reasoning stages. Across three challenging benchmarks -- GAIA,
BrowseComp, and Humanity's Last Exam -- COMPASS improves accuracy by up to 20%
relative to both single- and multi-agent baselines. We further introduce a
test-time scaling extension that elevates performance to match established
DeepResearch agents, and a post-training pipeline that delegates context
management to smaller models for enhanced efficiency.

### [108] [Everyone prefers human writers, including AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08831)
*Wouter Haverals,Meredith Martin*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 人类和AI在评估文学风格时都存在系统性偏见，AI比人类表现出更强的反AI偏见（2.5倍），这种偏见在AI架构间普遍存在，导致对标注为AI生成的内容评价更低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI写作工具的普及，需要理解人类和机器如何评估文学风格这一主观领域，特别是测量评估者的归因偏见。

Method: 研究1：比较人类参与者（556人）和AI模型（13个）在盲测、准确标注和反事实标注条件下评估Queneau作品与GPT-4生成版本。研究2：在14×14的AI评估者和创作者矩阵中测试偏见泛化。

Result: 人类显示+13.7个百分点的偏见，AI模型显示+34.3个百分点的偏见（2.5倍更强）。研究2确认这种偏见在AI架构间普遍存在（+25.8个百分点）。归因标签导致评估者反转评估标准，相同特征仅因感知作者身份而获得相反评价。

Conclusion: AI模型在训练过程中吸收了人类对人工创造力的文化偏见，不仅复制而且放大了这种人类倾向，这是美学判断中人类与人工评估者归因偏见的首次受控比较。

Abstract: As AI writing tools become widespread, we need to understand how both humans
and machines evaluate literary style, a domain where objective standards are
elusive and judgments are inherently subjective. We conducted controlled
experiments using Raymond Queneau's Exercises in Style (1947) to measure
attribution bias across evaluators. Study 1 compared human participants (N=556)
and AI models (N=13) evaluating literary passages from Queneau versus
GPT-4-generated versions under three conditions: blind, accurately labeled, and
counterfactually labeled. Study 2 tested bias generalization across a
14$\times$14 matrix of AI evaluators and creators. Both studies revealed
systematic pro-human attribution bias. Humans showed +13.7 percentage point
(pp) bias (Cohen's h = 0.28, 95% CI: 0.21-0.34), while AI models showed +34.3
percentage point bias (h = 0.70, 95% CI: 0.65-0.76), a 2.5-fold stronger effect
(P$<$0.001). Study 2 confirmed this bias operates across AI architectures
(+25.8pp, 95% CI: 24.1-27.6%), demonstrating that AI systems systematically
devalue creative content when labeled as "AI-generated" regardless of which AI
created it. We also find that attribution labels cause evaluators to invert
assessment criteria, with identical features receiving opposing evaluations
based solely on perceived authorship. This suggests AI models have absorbed
human cultural biases against artificial creativity during training. Our study
represents the first controlled comparison of attribution bias between human
and artificial evaluators in aesthetic judgment, revealing that AI systems not
only replicate but amplify this human tendency.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了Agent GPA（目标-计划-行动）评估框架，包含五个评估指标：目标达成度、逻辑一致性、执行效率、计划质量和计划遵循度。该框架能系统性地覆盖广泛的智能体失败情况，支持LLM评估器与人工标注高度一致，并能准确定位错误以改进智能体性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的智能体评估方法缺乏系统性，无法全面覆盖智能体在目标设定、计划制定和行动执行等操作循环中的各种失败模式。需要开发一个能够系统评估智能体在完整操作循环中表现的框架。

Method: 提出基于智能体操作循环（设定目标、制定计划、执行行动）的Agent GPA评估框架，包含五个核心评估指标：目标达成度、逻辑一致性、执行效率、计划质量和计划遵循度。使用LLM作为评估器在两个基准数据集上进行验证。

Result: 在TRAIL/GAIA公开数据集和生产级数据智能体的内部数据集上验证表明：该框架能系统覆盖所有智能体错误；LLM评估器与人工标注的一致性达到80%-95%以上；错误定位准确率达到86%。

Conclusion: Agent GPA框架为智能体评估提供了系统性的方法，能够全面覆盖智能体失败模式，支持高效的自动化评估，并能准确定位问题以指导智能体性能改进。

Abstract: We introduce the Agent GPA (Goal-Plan-Action) framework: an evaluation
paradigm based on an agent's operational loop of setting goals, devising plans,
and executing actions. The framework includes five evaluation metrics: Goal
Fulfillment, Logical Consistency, Execution Efficiency, Plan Quality, and Plan
Adherence. Logical Consistency checks that an agent's actions are consistent
with its prior actions. Execution Efficiency checks whether the agent executes
in the most efficient way to achieve its goal. Plan Quality checks whether an
agent's plans are aligned with its goals; Plan Adherence checks if an agent's
actions are aligned with its plan; and Goal Fulfillment checks that agent's
final outcomes match the stated goals. Our experimental results on two
benchmark datasets - the public TRAIL/GAIA dataset and an internal dataset for
a production-grade data agent - show that this framework (a) provides a
systematic way to cover a broad range of agent failures, including all agent
errors on the TRAIL/GAIA benchmark dataset; (b) supports LLM-judges that
exhibit strong agreement with human annotation, covering 80% to over 95%
errors; and (c) localizes errors with 86% agreement to enable targeted
improvement of agent performance.

TL;DR: 提出了ReviewerToo框架，用于研究和部署AI辅助同行评审，在ICLR 2025数据集上验证显示AI评审员在接收/拒绝分类任务上达到81.8%准确率，接近人类评审员的83.9%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统同行评审存在的不一致性、评审员主观性和可扩展性挑战，通过AI辅助评审来补充人类判断。

Method: 开发了模块化框架ReviewerToo，支持使用专业评审员角色和结构化评估标准进行系统实验，可部分或完全集成到真实会议工作流中。

Result: 在ICLR 2025的1,963篇论文数据集上，GPT-OSS-120B模型在接收/拒绝分类任务上达到81.8%准确率，AI生成的评审质量在LLM评估中高于人类平均水平，但在方法论新颖性和理论贡献评估方面仍有不足。

Conclusion: AI可以增强评审的一致性、覆盖范围和公平性，但复杂评估仍需领域专家，提出了将AI集成到同行评审流程的指南，为混合评审系统奠定基础。

Abstract: Peer review is the cornerstone of scientific publishing, yet it suffers from
inconsistencies, reviewer subjectivity, and scalability challenges. We
introduce ReviewerToo, a modular framework for studying and deploying
AI-assisted peer review to complement human judgment with systematic and
consistent assessments. ReviewerToo supports systematic experiments with
specialized reviewer personas and structured evaluation criteria, and can be
partially or fully integrated into real conference workflows. We validate
ReviewerToo on a carefully curated dataset of 1,963 paper submissions from ICLR
2025, where our experiments with the gpt-oss-120b model achieves 81.8% accuracy
for the task of categorizing a paper as accept/reject compared to 83.9% for the
average human reviewer. Additionally, ReviewerToo-generated reviews are rated
as higher quality than the human average by an LLM judge, though still trailing
the strongest expert contributions. Our analysis highlights domains where AI
reviewers excel (e.g., fact-checking, literature coverage) and where they
struggle (e.g., assessing methodological novelty and theoretical
contributions), underscoring the continued need for human expertise. Based on
these findings, we propose guidelines for integrating AI into peer-review
pipelines, showing how AI can enhance consistency, coverage, and fairness while
leaving complex evaluative judgments to domain experts. Our work provides a
foundation for systematic, hybrid peer-review systems that scale with the
growth of scientific publishing.

*Siqi Zhu,David Zhang,Pedro Cisneros-Velarde,Jiaxuan You*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出GTAlign框架，将博弈论决策融入LLM的推理和训练过程，通过构建收益矩阵和互惠奖励来优化用户与模型之间的互动，提高回答质量和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统对齐方法假设最大化模型奖励就能最大化用户福利，但实际上模型可能产生过度澄清或冗长回答，导致用户不满。这类似于囚徒困境，需要一种互利决策机制。

Method: 在推理阶段将用户-LLM互动建模为策略博弈，构建收益矩阵评估双方福利；在训练阶段引入互惠奖励强化合作响应；还包含基于博弈论推理的动态适应技术。

Result: 实验表明GTAlign在多种任务中显著提升了推理效率、回答质量和互惠福利，优于基线方法。

Conclusion: GTAlign通过博弈论方法有效解决了LLM与用户互动中的次优问题，实现了更好的对齐效果和互惠结果。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in reasoning,
yet sometimes produce responses that are suboptimal for users in tasks such as
writing, information seeking, or providing practical guidance. Conventional
alignment practices typically assume that maximizing model reward also
maximizes user welfare, but this assumption frequently fails in practice:
models may over-clarify or generate overly verbose reasoning when users prefer
concise answers. Such behaviors resemble the prisoner's dilemma, where
individually rational choices lead to socially suboptimal outcomes. The
fundamental challenge is the lack of a principled decision making mechanism
that mutually benefits both the LLM and the user. We propose Game-Theoretic
Alignment (GTAlign), an alignment framework that integrates game-theoretic
decision making into both reasoning and training. During reasoning, the model
explicitly treats user-LLM interaction as a strategic game: it constructs
payoff matrices within its reasoning chain to estimate welfare for both itself
and the user, and then selects actions that are mutually beneficial. During
training, we introduce a mutual welfare reward that reinforces cooperative
responses, aligning model behavior with socially efficient outcomes. In
addition, we introduce an inference technique that leverages game-theoretic
reasoning to dynamically adapt LLM's response when pricing policies of LLM
service change. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GTAlign substantially
improves reasoning efficiency, answer quality, and mutual welfare compared to
baselines across diverse tasks. The code is available at

TL;DR: 提出了LM Fight Arena框架，通过在格斗游戏《真人快打II》中让大型多模态模型相互对战，评估它们在实时对抗环境中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大型多模态模型基准测试往往无法捕捉它们在实时对抗环境中的真实性能表现。

Method: 在受控的锦标赛中测试了六个领先的开源和闭源模型，每个模型控制相同的游戏角色以确保公平比较。模型需要解析游戏画面和状态数据来选择下一步动作。

Result: LM Fight Arena提供了一个完全自动化、可重现且客观的评估框架，能够评估LMM在动态环境中的战略推理能力。

Conclusion: 这项工作引入了一个具有挑战性和趣味性的基准测试，弥合了AI评估与互动娱乐之间的差距。

Abstract: Existing benchmarks for large multimodal models (LMMs) often fail to capture
their performance in real-time, adversarial environments. We introduce LM Fight
Arena (Large Model Fight Arena), a novel framework that evaluates LMMs by
pitting them against each other in the classic fighting game Mortal Kombat II,
a task requiring rapid visual understanding and tactical, sequential
decision-making. In a controlled tournament, we test six leading open- and
closed-source models, where each agent operates controlling the same character
to ensure a fair comparison. The models are prompted to interpret game frames
and state data to select their next actions. Unlike static evaluations, LM
Fight Arena provides a fully automated, reproducible, and objective assessment
of an LMM's strategic reasoning capabilities in a dynamic setting. This work
introduces a challenging and engaging benchmark that bridges the gap between AI
evaluation and interactive entertainment.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RADAR是一个基于机制可解释性的框架，通过区分基于记忆和基于推理的模型响应来检测数据污染，准确率达到93%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数据污染对可靠的大语言模型评估构成重大挑战，模型可能通过记忆训练数据而非展示真正推理能力来获得高性能。

Method: RADAR提取37个特征，涵盖表面级置信度轨迹和深层机制特性，包括注意力专业化、电路动态和激活流模式，并使用这些特征训练集成分类器。

Result: 在多样化评估集上达到93%的准确率，在清晰案例上表现完美，在具有挑战性的模糊示例上达到76.7%的准确率。

Conclusion: 这项工作展示了机制可解释性在超越传统表面级指标推进大语言模型评估方面的潜力。

Abstract: Data contamination poses a significant challenge to reliable LLM evaluation,
where models may achieve high performance by memorizing training data rather
than demonstrating genuine reasoning capabilities. We introduce RADAR (Recall
vs. Reasoning Detection through Activation Representation), a novel framework
that leverages mechanistic interpretability to detect contamination by
distinguishing recall-based from reasoning-based model responses. RADAR
extracts 37 features spanning surface-level confidence trajectories and deep
mechanistic properties including attention specialization, circuit dynamics,
and activation flow patterns. Using an ensemble of classifiers trained on these
features, RADAR achieves 93\% accuracy on a diverse evaluation set, with
perfect performance on clear cases and 76.7\% accuracy on challenging ambiguous
examples. This work demonstrates the potential of mechanistic interpretability
for advancing LLM evaluation beyond traditional surface-level metrics.

TL;DR: 提出了一个评估RAG（检索增强生成）管道的基准，包含多模态数据测试集、短语级召回指标、幻觉检测方法，并比较了开源和闭源管道的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准主要关注检索等特定方面，缺乏对RAG管道整体能力的评估，特别是在多模态信息处理方面。

Method: 创建包含93个问题的多模态测试集，开发短语级召回指标和基于最近邻嵌入的幻觉检测分类器，比较2个开源和4个闭源管道的性能。

Result: 闭源管道在正确性和幻觉检测方面显著优于开源管道，特别是在多模态和跨文档问题上差距更大。人工评估显示指标与人类判断高度一致。

Conclusion: 该基准能有效评估RAG管道的整体能力，闭源模型在多模态信息处理方面表现更好，提出的指标与人类评估有良好一致性。

Abstract: Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has emerged as a promising paradigm for
improving factual accuracy in large language models (LLMs). We introduce a
benchmark designed to evaluate RAG pipelines as a whole, evaluating a
pipeline's ability to ingest, retrieve, and reason about several modalities of
information, differentiating it from existing benchmarks that focus on
particular aspects such as retrieval. We present (1) a small, human-created
dataset of 93 questions designed to evaluate a pipeline's ability to ingest
textual data, tables, images, and data spread across these modalities in one or
more documents; (2) a phrase-level recall metric for correctness; (3) a
nearest-neighbor embedding classifier to identify potential pipeline
hallucinations; (4) a comparative evaluation of 2 pipelines built with
open-source retrieval mechanisms and 4 closed-source foundation models; and (5)
a third-party human evaluation of the alignment of our correctness and
hallucination metrics. We find that closed-source pipelines significantly
outperform open-source pipelines in both correctness and hallucination metrics,
with wider performance gaps in questions relying on multimodal and
cross-document information. Human evaluation of our metrics showed average
agreement of 4.62 for correctness and 4.53 for hallucination detection on a 1-5
Likert scale (5 indicating "strongly agree").

TL;DR: EcphoryRAG是一个基于实体知识图谱的RAG框架，通过提取核心实体和元数据实现轻量级索引，相比其他结构化RAG系统减少94%的token消耗。系统从查询中提取线索实体，在知识图谱上进行可扩展的多跳关联搜索，并动态推断实体间的隐式关系来填充上下文。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受人类认知神经科学启发，人类利用线索激活实体中心记忆痕迹进行复杂的多跳回忆。作者希望将这种机制应用于RAG系统，提高复杂问答的性能。

Method: 1) 索引阶段仅提取和存储核心实体及元数据；2) 检索阶段从查询中提取线索实体；3) 在知识图谱上进行多跳关联搜索；4) 动态推断实体间的隐式关系来构建上下文。

Result: 在2WikiMultiHop、HotpotQA和MuSiQue基准测试中，EcphoryRAG实现了新的最先进水平，将平均精确匹配(EM)分数从0.392提升到0.474，优于HippoRAG等强KG-RAG方法。

Conclusion: 实体-线索-多跳检索范式在复杂问答任务中表现出高效性，验证了基于认知神经科学启发的RAG框架的有效性。

Abstract: Cognitive neuroscience research indicates that humans leverage cues to
activate entity-centered memory traces (engrams) for complex, multi-hop
recollection. Inspired by this mechanism, we introduce EcphoryRAG, an
entity-centric knowledge graph RAG framework. During indexing, EcphoryRAG
extracts and stores only core entities with corresponding metadata, a
lightweight approach that reduces token consumption by up to 94\% compared to
other structured RAG systems. For retrieval, the system first extracts cue
entities from queries, then performs a scalable multi-hop associative search
across the knowledge graph. Crucially, EcphoryRAG dynamically infers implicit
relations between entities to populate context, enabling deep reasoning without
exhaustive pre-enumeration of relationships. Extensive evaluations on the
2WikiMultiHop, HotpotQA, and MuSiQue benchmarks demonstrate that EcphoryRAG
sets a new state-of-the-art, improving the average Exact Match (EM) score from
0.392 to 0.474 over strong KG-RAG methods like HippoRAG. These results validate
the efficacy of the entity-cue-multi-hop retrieval paradigm for complex
question answering.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DualResearch是一个检索和融合框架，通过联合建模广度语义图和深度因果图来解决深度研究框架中的上下文污染、证据支持薄弱和执行路径脆弱问题，在科学推理基准上显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的深度研究框架虽然能协调外部工具进行复杂的多步科学推理，但仍存在上下文污染、证据支持薄弱和执行路径脆弱等问题，需要改进。

Method: 提出DualResearch框架，联合建模两个互补图：广度语义图编码稳定背景知识，深度因果图捕获执行来源。每个图都有层原生相关性函数，广度使用种子锚定的语义扩散，深度使用因果语义路径匹配和可靠性加权。通过熵门控规则在log空间融合答案分布。

Result: 在科学推理基准HLE和GPQA上，DualResearch实现了有竞争力的性能。使用开源系统InternAgent的日志文件，在HLE上准确率提升7.7%，在GPQA上提升6.06%。

Conclusion: DualResearch作为深度研究系统的补充，能够将冗长的多工具执行日志压缩为简洁的推理图，稳定有效地重构答案，显著提升了科学推理的性能。

Abstract: The deep-research framework orchestrates external tools to perform complex,
multi-step scientific reasoning that exceeds the native limits of a single
large language model. However, it still suffers from context pollution, weak
evidentiary support, and brittle execution paths. To address these issues, we
propose DualResearch, a retrieval and fusion framework that matches the
epistemic structure of tool-intensive reasoning by jointly modeling two
complementary graphs: a breadth semantic graph that encodes stable background
knowledge, and a depth causal graph that captures execution provenance. Each
graph has a layer-native relevance function, seed-anchored semantic diffusion
for breadth, and causal-semantic path matching with reliability weighting for
depth. To reconcile their heterogeneity and query-dependent uncertainty,
DualResearch converts per-layer path evidence into answer distributions and
fuses them in log space via an entropy-gated rule with global calibration. The
fusion up-weights the more certain channel and amplifies agreement. As a
complement to deep-research systems, DualResearch compresses lengthy multi-tool
execution logs into a concise reasoning graph, and we show that it can
reconstruct answers stably and effectively. On the scientific reasoning
benchmarks HLE and GPQA, DualResearch achieves competitive performance. Using
log files from the open-source system InternAgent, its accuracy improves by
7.7% on HLE and 6.06% on GPQA.

*Wenyi Wu,Kun Zhou,Ruoxin Yuan,Vivian Yu,Stephen Wang,Zhiting Hu,Biwei Huang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种连续记忆机制，用于增强GUI代理在陌生界面和长时任务中的泛化能力，通过VLM编码轨迹为固定长度的连续嵌入，显著减少上下文成本并保留视觉细节。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GUI代理将历史轨迹压缩为文本token，导致上下文长度膨胀且丢失关键视觉线索（如控件大小和位置），需要更高效的记忆机制来支持跨界面泛化和长时任务。

Method: 使用VLM作为编码器将GUI轨迹编码为固定长度的连续嵌入序列，直接输入到骨干网络；引入自动扩展数据飞轮，通过搜索发现新环境、VLM合成任务、代理执行轨迹和VLM验证成功来低成本扩展记忆。

Result: 随着记忆大小和检索深度增加，性能单调提升；在真实GUI基准测试中，记忆增强代理在长时任务和分布偏移下持续提高成功率；Qwen-2.5-VL-7B+连续记忆达到与GPT-4o、Claude-4等闭源模型相当的性能。

Conclusion: 连续记忆机制能有效提升GUI代理的泛化能力，在保持低计算成本的同时显著改善长时任务性能，证明了视觉信息保留和高效记忆编码的重要性。

Abstract: We study how to endow GUI agents with scalable memory that help generalize
across unfamiliar interfaces and long-horizon tasks. Prior GUI agents compress
past trajectories into text tokens, which balloons context length and misses
decisive visual cues (e.g., exact widget size and position). We propose a
continuous memory that encodes each GUI trajectory into a fixed-length sequence
of continuous embeddings using the VLM itself as an encoder; these embeddings
are plugged directly into the backbone's input layer, sharply reducing context
cost while preserving fine-grained visual information. As memory size and
retrieval depth increase, performance improves monotonically, unlike text
memories that degrade with long prompts. To grow memory at low cost, we
introduce an auto-scaling data flywheel that (i) discovers new environments via
search, (ii) synthesizes tasks with an open-source VLM, (iii) rolls out
trajectories with the agent, and (iv) verifies success with the same VLM. Using
this pipeline, we collect 100k+ trajectories for about \$4000 and fine-tune
only the memory encoder (LoRA on a Q-Former, 1.2\% parameters) with 1,500
samples. On real-world GUI benchmarks, our memory-augmented agent consistently
improves success rates under long horizons and distribution shifts. Notably,
Qwen-2.5-VL-7B + continuous memory achieves performance comparable to
state-of-the-art closed-source models (e.g., GPT-4o, Claude-4).

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出Semantic-condition Tuning (SCT)方法，通过图神经网络提取知识图谱的语义条件，并自适应地调制文本嵌入，实现深度知识融合，显著优于传统的prefix-tuning方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有prefix-tuning方法简单地将知识嵌入与文本输入拼接，忽略了知识图谱中丰富的关系语义，并给LLM带来了隐式推理负担。

Method: SCT包含两个关键模块：语义图模块使用图神经网络从局部图邻域提取上下文感知的语义条件；条件自适应融合模块通过参数化投影器自适应地调制文本嵌入。

Result: 在知识图谱基准测试上的广泛实验表明，SCT显著优于prefix-tuning和其他强基线方法。

Conclusion: 通过在LLM推理前用语义图上下文调制输入表示，SCT提供了更直接和有效的信号，实现了更准确和鲁棒的知识推理。

Abstract: Fusing Knowledge Graphs with Large Language Models is crucial for
knowledge-intensive tasks like knowledge graph completion. The prevailing
paradigm, prefix-tuning, simply concatenates knowledge embeddings with text
inputs. However, this shallow fusion overlooks the rich relational semantics
within KGs and imposes a significant implicit reasoning burden on the LLM to
correlate the prefix with the text. To address these, we propose
Semantic-condition Tuning (SCT), a new knowledge injection paradigm comprising
two key modules. First, a Semantic Graph Module employs a Graph Neural Network
to extract a context-aware semantic condition from the local graph
neighborhood, guided by knowledge-enhanced relations. Subsequently, this
condition is passed to a Condition-Adaptive Fusion Module, which, in turn,
adaptively modulates the textual embedding via two parameterized projectors,
enabling a deep, feature-wise, and knowledge-aware interaction. The resulting
pre-fused embedding is then fed into the LLM for fine-tuning. Extensive
experiments on knowledge graph benchmarks demonstrate that SCT significantly
outperforms prefix-tuning and other strong baselines. Our analysis confirms
that by modulating the input representation with semantic graph context before
LLM inference, SCT provides a more direct and potent signal, enabling more
accurate and robust knowledge reasoning.

Abstract: Learning complex network dynamics is fundamental to understanding, modelling
and controlling real-world complex systems. There are two main problems in the
task of predicting the dynamic evolution of complex networks: on the one hand,
existing methods usually use simple graphs to describe the relationships in
complex networks; however, this approach can only capture pairwise
relationships, while there may be rich non-pairwise structured relationships in
the network. First-order GNNs have difficulty in capturing dynamic non-pairwise
relationships. On the other hand, theoretical prediction models lack accuracy
and data-driven prediction models lack interpretability. To address the above
problems, this paper proposes a higher-order network dynamics identification
method for long-term dynamic prediction of complex networks. Firstly, to
address the problem that traditional graph machine learning can only deal with
pairwise relations, dynamic hypergraph learning is introduced to capture the
higher-order non-pairwise relations among complex networks and improve the
accuracy of complex network modelling. Then, a dual-driven dynamic prediction
module for physical data is proposed. The Koopman operator theory is introduced
to transform the nonlinear dynamical differential equations for the dynamic
evolution of complex networks into linear systems for solving. Meanwhile, the
physical information neural differential equation method is utilised to ensure
that the dynamic evolution conforms to the physical laws. The dual-drive
dynamic prediction module ensures both accuracy and interpretability of the
prediction. Validated on public datasets and self-built industrial chain
network datasets, the experimental results show that the method in this paper
has good prediction accuracy and long-term prediction performance.

TL;DR: Tiny-R1V是一个轻量级的3B多模态大语言模型，通过两阶段优化实现更快的推理速度和更高的准确率，统一了多任务的多模态推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管多模态大语言模型在多种任务中表现出色，但在推理效率方面面临模型规模大、过度思考和轻量级场景下准确率下降等挑战，而轻量级MLLMs的推理能力研究相对缺乏。

Method: 采用两阶段优化：第一阶段引入LIPO强化学习方法，动态调整组内响应优势，优先简洁高质量响应；第二阶段提出AMM训练自由模型融合方法，通过自适应调整任务向量权重和梯度投影正则化损失函数，将多个专家模型融合为统一架构。

Result: 在十个广泛使用的推理基准测试（涵盖数学、结构化数据、OCR和通用能力）上表现出优越性能，使轻量级模型在多样化多模态推理任务中表现出色。

Conclusion: Tiny-R1V通过创新的两阶段优化方法，成功解决了轻量级多模态大语言模型在推理效率和准确性方面的挑战，为轻量级模型在多模态推理任务中的应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Although Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated
remarkable capabilities across diverse tasks, they encounter numerous
challenges in terms of reasoning efficiency, such as large model size,
overthinking, and compromised accuracy in lightweight scenarios. However,
research on the reasoning capabilities of lightweight MLLMs is quite lacking.
To this end, we propose Tiny-R1V, a novel lightweight 3B model that achieves
faster inference and higher accuracy via a two-stage optimization, while
unifying multimodal reasoning across multiple tasks and using fewer tokens. In
the first stage, Tiny-R1V introduces Length-Informed Relative Policy
Optimization (LIPO), a novel reinforcement learning method, to train each
reasoning model. The LIPO is designed to dynamically adjusts advantages of
responses within groups, that is, by prioritizing concise yet high-quality
responses to encourage the generation of shorter and more accurate response. In
the second stage, we propose Adaptive Model Merging (AMM), a training-free
model merging method that merges multiple specialist models into a unified
architecture. Specifically, AMM adaptively adjusts the weights of task vectors
and robustly optimizes the merged vectors via a novel gradient projection
regularization loss function, thus mitigating redundant conflicts between them.
Extensive evaluations on ten widely-used reasoning benchmarks covering
mathematics, structured data (charts, tables, documents), OCR, and general
capabilities showcase the superior performance of Tiny-R1V, enabling
lightweight models to excel in diverse multimodal reasoning tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs在医疗领域的广泛应用，需要评估其是否考虑医疗的社会性质，特别是健康差异和社会偏见如何影响LLM生成的医疗建议。

Method: 通过模拟不同患者档案（性别、年龄、种族）询问一系列关键临床领域的医疗问题，比较生成回答的自然语言特征。

Result: LLMs生成的医疗建议在不同社会群体间存在系统性差异，原住民和双性人患者收到的建议可读性更差、更复杂，交叉群体的差异趋势更加明显。

Conclusion: 鉴于人们对这些模型的信任日益增加，需要提高AI素养，并呼吁AI开发者紧急调查和缓解这些系统性差异，确保不转化为不公正的患者支持。

Abstract: With the rapid progress of Large Language Models (LLMs), the general public
now has easy and affordable access to applications capable of answering most
health-related questions in a personalized manner. These LLMs are increasingly
proving to be competitive, and now even surpass professionals in some medical
capabilities. They hold particular promise in low-resource settings,
considering they provide the possibility of widely accessible, quasi-free
healthcare support. However, evaluations that fuel these motivations highly
lack insights into the social nature of healthcare, oblivious to health
disparities between social groups and to how bias may translate into
LLM-generated medical advice and impact users. We provide an exploratory
analysis of LLM answers to a series of medical questions spanning key clinical
domains, where we simulate these questions being asked by several patient
profiles that vary in sex, age range, and ethnicity. By comparing natural
language features of the generated responses, we show that, when LLMs are used
for medical advice generation, they generate responses that systematically
differ between social groups. In particular, Indigenous and intersex patients
receive advice that is less readable and more complex. We observe these trends
amplify when intersectional groups are considered. Considering the increasing
trust individuals place in these models, we argue for higher AI literacy and
for the urgent need for investigation and mitigation by AI developers to ensure
these systemic differences are diminished and do not translate to unjust
patient support. Our code is publicly available on GitHub.

Abstract: Travel planning is a valuable yet complex task that poses significant
challenges even for advanced large language models (LLMs). While recent
benchmarks have advanced in evaluating LLMs' planning capabilities, they often
fall short in evaluating feasibility, reliability, and engagement of travel
plans. We introduce a comprehensive benchmark for travel planning that unifies
fine-grained criteria into a single reward, enabling direct comparison of plan
quality and seamless integration with reinforcement learning (RL). Our
evaluator achieves moderate agreement with travel-expert annotations (60.75\%)
and outperforms multiple LLM-as-judge baselines. We further release a
large-scale dataset of 4,870 queries including 219 real-world, free-form
requests for generalization to authentic user intent. Using this benchmark, we
conduct extensive experiments across diverse methods and LLMs, including
test-time computation, neuro-symbolic approaches, supervised fine-tuning, and
RL via GRPO. Across base models, RL generally improves itinerary feasibility
over prompt-only and supervised baselines, yielding higher unified reward
scores.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs在解决奥林匹克数学问题方面取得显著进展，需要评估它们在证明评分方面的能力，包括错误检测、严重性判断和公平分数分配。

Method: 使用90个Gemini 2.5 Pro生成的解决方案和MathArena数据集，引入智能体工作流程提取参考解决方案并自动推导问题特定的评分标准，进行多步骤评分过程。

Result: 模型能够可靠地标记错误解决方案，但在部分分数分配上存在校准差距。提出的工作流程在注释语料库和MathArena上都实现了与人工评分更高的一致性。

Conclusion: 智能体工作流程能够有效提高LLMs在数学证明评分方面的准确性和一致性，为未来研究提供了代码、数据和提示/日志资源。

Abstract: State-of-the-art (SOTA) LLMs have progressed from struggling on proof-based
Olympiad problems to solving most of the IMO 2025 problems, with leading
systems reportedly handling 5 of 6 problems. Given this progress, we assess how
well these models can grade proofs: detecting errors, judging their severity,
and assigning fair scores beyond binary correctness. We study proof-analysis
capabilities using a corpus of 90 Gemini 2.5 Pro-generated solutions that we
grade on a 1-4 scale with detailed error annotations, and on MathArena solution
sets for IMO/USAMO 2025 scored on a 0-7 scale. Our analysis shows that models
can reliably flag incorrect (including subtly incorrect) solutions but exhibit
calibration gaps in how partial credit is assigned. To address this, we
introduce agentic workflows that extract and analyze reference solutions and
automatically derive problem-specific rubrics for a multi-step grading process.
We instantiate and compare different design choices for the grading workflows,
and evaluate their trade-offs. Across our annotated corpus and MathArena, our
proposed workflows achieve higher agreement with human grades and more
consistent handling of partial credit across metrics. We release all code,
data, and prompts/logs to facilitate future research.

Motivation: 当前正则表达式DoS漏洞修复方法存在权衡：符号化方法精确但无法处理未见模式，LLM方法泛化强但可靠性不足。需要结合两者优势的解决方案。

Method: LRR框架：首先使用确定性符号模块定位易受攻击的子模式，然后调用LLM为隔离的片段生成语义等效的修复。

Result: 成功解决了基于规则修复无法处理的复杂修复案例，同时避免了纯LLM方法的语义错误，修复率比最先进方法提高了15.4个百分点。

Conclusion: LRR提供了一种经过验证的方法论，通过解耦问题识别和修复过程，有效结合了符号化方法的精确性和LLM的泛化能力。

Abstract: Regular expressions (regexes) are foundational to modern computing for
critical tasks like input validation and data parsing, yet their ubiquity
exposes systems to regular expression denial of service (ReDoS), a
vulnerability requiring automated repair methods. Current approaches, however,
are hampered by a trade-off. Symbolic, rule-based system are precise but fails
to repair unseen or complex vulnerability patterns. Conversely, large language
models (LLMs) possess the necessary generalizability but are unreliable for
tasks demanding strict syntactic and semantic correctness. We resolve this
impasse by introducing a hybrid framework, localized regex repair (LRR),
designed to harness LLM generalization while enforcing reliability. Our core
insight is to decouple problem identification from the repair process. First, a
deterministic, symbolic module localizes the precise vulnerable subpattern,
creating a constrained and tractable problem space. Then, the LLM invoked to
generate a semantically equivalent fix for this isolated segment. This combined
architecture successfully resolves complex repair cases intractable for
rule-based repair while avoiding the semantic errors of LLM-only approaches.
Our work provides a validated methodology for solving such problems in
automated repair, improving the repair rate by 15.4%p over the
state-of-the-art. Our code is available at https://github.com/cdltlehf/LRR.

Result: 定量和定性分析表明模型具有良好模拟意识的可能性，尽管不同角色和意识之间的响应差异不显著。模型展示了在复杂认知情境中构建更直观适应性AI系统的潜力。

Conclusion: 本研究为在复杂认知情境中改进AI交互开辟了新途径，证明了整合精神分析和人格理论元素可以构建具有类人意识的人工智能系统。

Abstract: Human consciousness is still a concept hard to define with current scientific
understanding. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated
significant advancements across various domains including translation and
summarization, human consciousness is not something to imitate with current
upfront technology owing to so-called hallucination. This study, therefore,
proposes a novel approach to address these challenges by integrating
psychoanalysis and the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) into constructing
consciousness and personality modules. We developed three artificial
consciousnesses (self-awareness, unconsciousness, and preconsciousness) based
on the principles of psychoanalysis. Additionally, we designed 16 characters
with different personalities representing the sixteen MBTI types, with several
attributes such as needs, status, and memories. To determine if our model's
artificial consciousness exhibits human-like cognition, we created ten distinct
situations considering seven attributes such as emotional understanding and
logical thinking. The decision-making process of artificial consciousness and
the final action were evaluated in three ways: survey evaluation, three-tier
classification via ChatGPT, and qualitative review. Both quantitative and
qualitative analyses indicated a high likelihood of well-simulated
consciousness, although the difference in response between different characters
and consciousnesses was not very significant. This implies that the developed
models incorporating elements of psychoanalysis and personality theory can lead
to building a more intuitive and adaptable AI system with humanoid
consciousness. Therefore, this study contributes to opening up new avenues for
improving AI interactions in complex cognitive contexts.

Motivation: 现有LLM在代码复杂度预测中表现不均衡，没有单一模型在所有复杂度类别上都表现优异，每个模型只在特定类别上有优势。

Method: MEC³O多专家共识系统：基于性能将LLM分配到复杂度类别，提供类别专用指令使其成为专家；专家进行结构化辩论；通过加权共识机制整合预测结果。

Result: 在CodeComplex数据集上，MEC³O比开源基线准确率和macro-F1分数至少高出10%；平均macro-F1分数超过GPT-4o-mini；与GPT-4o和GPT-4o-mini的F1分数相当。

Conclusion: 多专家辩论和加权共识策略能有效生成最终预测，证明了该方法在代码复杂度预测任务上的有效性。

Abstract: Predicting the complexity of source code is essential for software
development and algorithm analysis. Recently, Baik et al. (2025) introduced
CodeComplex for code time complexity prediction. The paper shows that LLMs
without fine-tuning struggle with certain complexity classes. This suggests
that no single LLM excels at every class, but rather each model shows
advantages in certain classes. We propose MEC$^3$O, a multi-expert consensus
system, which extends the multi-agent debate frameworks. MEC$^3$O assigns LLMs
to complexity classes based on their performance and provides them with
class-specialized instructions, turning them into experts. These experts engage
in structured debates, and their predictions are integrated through a weighted
consensus mechanism. Our expertise assignments to LLMs effectively handle
Degeneration-of-Thought, reducing reliance on a separate judge model, and
preventing convergence to incorrect majority opinions. Experiments on
CodeComplex show that MEC$^3$O outperforms the open-source baselines, achieving
at least 10% higher accuracy and macro-F1 scores. It also surpasses GPT-4o-mini
in macro-F1 scores on average and demonstrates competitive on-par F1 scores to
GPT-4o and GPT-o4-mini on average. This demonstrates the effectiveness of
multi-expert debates and weight consensus strategy to generate the final
predictions. Our code and data is available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需训练、在推理时控制流式文本到图像模型的方法，通过特征空间目标和时间调度的随机扰动来增强生成多样性，同时保持图像质量和提示对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 流式文本到图像模型遵循确定性轨迹，用户需要重复采样才能发现多样模式，这是一个成本高且效率低的过程。

Method: 同时通过特征空间目标鼓励轨迹间的横向扩展，并通过时间调度的随机扰动重新引入不确定性。关键的是，这种扰动被投影为与生成流正交，这种几何约束使其能够在不降低图像细节或提示保真度的情况下增强变化。

Result: 在固定采样预算下，该方法在多个文本到图像设置中持续改进了Vendi Score和Brisque等多样性指标，同时保持了图像质量和对齐度。

Conclusion: 该方法无需重新训练或修改基础采样器，与常见的流匹配求解器兼容，理论上显示能单调增加体积代理，同时由于几何约束近似保持边际分布，这为生成质量稳健保持提供了原理性解释。

Abstract: Flow-based text-to-image models follow deterministic trajectories, forcing
users to repeatedly sample to discover diverse modes, which is a costly and
inefficient process. We present a training-free, inference-time control
mechanism that makes the flow itself diversity-aware. Our method simultaneously
encourages lateral spread among trajectories via a feature-space objective and
reintroduces uncertainty through a time-scheduled stochastic perturbation.
Crucially, this perturbation is projected to be orthogonal to the generation
flow, a geometric constraint that allows it to boost variation without
degrading image details or prompt fidelity. Our procedure requires no
retraining or modification to the base sampler and is compatible with common
flow-matching solvers. Theoretically, our method is shown to monotonically
increase a volume surrogate while, due to its geometric constraints,
approximately preserving the marginal distribution. This provides a principled
explanation for why generation quality is robustly maintained. Empirically,
across multiple text-to-image settings under fixed sampling budgets, our method
consistently improves diversity metrics such as the Vendi Score and Brisque
over strong baselines, while upholding image quality and alignment.

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents have shown remarkable progress in social
deduction games (SDGs). However, existing approaches primarily focus on
information processing and strategy selection, overlooking the significance of
persuasive communication in influencing other players' beliefs and responses.
In SDGs, success depends not only on making correct deductions but on
convincing others to response in alignment with one's intent. To address this
limitation, we formalize turn-based dialogue in SDGs as a Stackelberg
competition, where the current player acts as the leader who strategically
influences the follower's response. Building on this theoretical foundation, we
propose a reinforcement learning framework that trains agents to optimize
utterances for persuasive impact. Through comprehensive experiments across
three diverse SDGs, we demonstrate that our agents significantly outperform
baselines. This work represents a significant step toward developing AI agents
capable of strategic social influence, with implications extending to scenarios
requiring persuasive communication.

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have achieved remarkable progress in complex
problem-solving tasks. Despite this success, LRMs typically suffer from high
computational costs during deployment, highlighting a need for efficient
inference. A popular direction of efficiency improvement is to switch the LRM
between thinking and nonthinking modes dynamically. However, such approaches
often introduce additional reasoning errors and lack statistical guarantees for
the performance loss, which are critical for high-stakes applications. In this
work, we propose Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) reasoning that controls
the performance loss under the user-specified performance loss tolerance. In
particular, we construct an upper confidence bound on the performance loss,
formulated as a monotone function of the uncertainty score, and subsequently
determine a threshold for switching to the nonthinking model. Theoretically,
using the threshold to switch between the thinking and nonthinking modes
ensures bounded performance loss in a distribution-free manner. Our
comprehensive experiments on reasoning benchmarks show that the proposed method
can save computational budgets and control the user-specified performance loss.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) show strong performance across natural language
processing (NLP), mathematical reasoning, and programming, and recent large
reasoning models (LRMs) further emphasize explicit reasoning. Yet their
computational limits, particularly spatial complexity constrained by finite
context windows, remain poorly understood. While recent works often focus on
problems within the NP complexity class, we push the boundary by introducing a
novel benchmark grounded in two PSPACE-complete regular expression (regex)
problems: equivalence decision (RegexEQ) and minimization (RegexMin).
PSPACE-complete problems serve as a more rigorous standard for assessing
computational capacity, as their solutions require massive search space
exploration. We perform a double-exponential space exploration to construct a
labeled dataset of over a million regex instances with a sound filtering

5 LRMs of varying scales, revealing common failure patterns such as verbosity

### [132] [Fundamentals of Building Autonomous LLM Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09244)
*Victor de Lamo Castrillo,Habtom Kahsay Gidey,Alexander Lenz,Alois Knoll*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文综述了基于大语言模型的智能体架构与实现方法，探讨如何通过感知、推理、记忆和执行系统的整合，开发能够自动化复杂任务、缩小与人类能力差距的智能LLM智能体。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统大语言模型在现实世界任务中存在局限性，研究旨在探索开发"智能体化"LLM的模式，使其能够自动化复杂任务并缩小与人类能力的性能差距。

Method: 构建包含四个关键组件的智能体架构：感知系统将环境感知转换为有意义表示；推理系统通过思维链、思维树等技术制定计划、适应反馈和评估行动；记忆系统通过短期和长期机制保留知识；执行系统将内部决策转化为具体行动。

Result: 研究表明，整合这些系统能够产生更强大和通用的软件机器人，模拟人类认知过程以实现自主智能行为。

Conclusion: 通过系统化整合感知、推理、记忆和执行组件，可以开发出具备人类认知过程模拟能力的智能LLM智能体，为自动化复杂任务提供有效解决方案。

Abstract: This paper reviews the architecture and implementation methods of agents
powered by large language models (LLMs). Motivated by the limitations of
traditional LLMs in real-world tasks, the research aims to explore patterns to
develop "agentic" LLMs that can automate complex tasks and bridge the
performance gap with human capabilities. Key components include a perception
system that converts environmental percepts into meaningful representations; a
reasoning system that formulates plans, adapts to feedback, and evaluates
actions through different techniques like Chain-of-Thought and Tree-of-Thought;
a memory system that retains knowledge through both short-term and long-term
mechanisms; and an execution system that translates internal decisions into
concrete actions. This paper shows how integrating these systems leads to more
capable and generalized software bots that mimic human cognitive processes for
autonomous and intelligent behavior.

### [133] [Localist LLMs -- A Mathematical Framework for Dynamic Locality Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09338)
*Joachim Diederich*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一个新颖框架，通过可调节的局部化参数（locality dial）训练大语言模型，使其内部表示能够在局部化（可解释、基于规则）和分布式（泛化性强、高效）编码之间连续调整。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前大语言模型在可解释性和性能之间的权衡问题，特别是在需要透明度和能力的受监管领域，提供一种无需重新训练即可动态调整模型表示的方法。

Method: 使用组稀疏惩罚注意力机制、信息论锚点设计和动态规则注入，通过数学证明建立了明确的阈值条件，确保注意力集中在语义相关块上。

Result: 证明了当组稀疏惩罚超过特定阈值时，模型的注意力机制会集中在语义相关块上，实现低熵和高保真度，误差可忽略不计。

Conclusion: 该框架使从业者能够在可解释模式和高性能模式之间连续插值，支持需要透明度和能力的应用场景。

Abstract: We present a novel framework for training large language models with
continuously adjustable internal representations that span the full spectrum
from localist (interpretable, rule-based) to distributed (generalizable,
efficient) encodings. The key innovation is a locality dial, a tunable
parameter that dynamically controls the degree of localization during both
training and inference without requiring model retraining. This is achieved
through group sparsity penalties on attention mechanisms, information-theoretic
anchor design, and dynamic rule injection. We provide rigorous mathematical
proofs establishing explicit threshold conditions under which attention
provably concentrates on semantically relevant blocks, with exponential bounds
on attention entropy and pointer fidelity. Specifically, we prove that when
group sparsity penalties exceed certain threshold values, the model's attention
mechanisms concentrate on semantically relevant blocks, achieving low entropy
and high fidelity with negligible error. This framework enables practitioners
to continuously interpolate between interpretable and high-performance modes,
supporting applications in regulated domains requiring both transparency and
capability.

*Davide Maltoni,Matteo Ferrara*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 小语言模型可以通过学习底层规则（而非统计学习）解决演绎推理任务，研究发现归纳头在实现逻辑推理所需的规则补全和规则链式连接中起核心作用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大语言模型在逻辑推理方面表现出相关能力，但其内部机制仍未被充分探索。本文旨在揭示小语言模型如何通过规则学习而非统计学习来解决演绎推理任务。

Method: 使用小语言模型解决演绎推理任务，分析其内部表示和计算电路，特别关注归纳头在推理过程中的作用。

Result: 研究发现归纳头在实现规则补全和规则链式连接这两个逻辑推理关键步骤中发挥核心作用。

Conclusion: 小语言模型能够通过规则学习解决演绎推理任务，其内部机制中归纳头是实现逻辑推理的关键组件。

Abstract: Recent large language models have demonstrated relevant capabilities in
solving problems that require logical reasoning; however, the corresponding
internal mechanisms remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we show that a
small language model can solve a deductive reasoning task by learning the
underlying rules (rather than operating as a statistical learner). A low-level
explanation of its internal representations and computational circuits is then
provided. Our findings reveal that induction heads play a central role in the
implementation of the rule completion and rule chaining steps involved in the
logical inference required by the task.

*Augustin Delecluse,Pierre Schaus,Pascal Van Hentenryck*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了序列变量作为约束编程中处理车辆路径问题的新方法，能够处理可选访问点并支持插入启发式算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于后继变量的CP模型无法有效处理可选访问点或基于插入的启发式算法，限制了在车辆路径问题中的应用。

Method: 形式化定义了序列变量的计算域、更新操作和一致性级别，设计了专门的全局约束，并实现了与现有CP求解器的集成。

Result: 序列变量简化了问题建模，在Dial-a-Ride问题上实现了有竞争力的计算性能。

Conclusion: 序列变量为CP处理车辆路径问题提供了更直观和强大的建模框架，能够处理复杂约束并支持高效启发式算法。

Abstract: Constraint Programming (CP) offers an intuitive, declarative framework for
modeling Vehicle Routing Problems (VRP), yet classical CP models based on
successor variables cannot always deal with optional visits or insertion based
heuristics. To address these limitations, this paper formalizes sequence
variables within CP. Unlike the classical successor models, this computational
domain handle optional visits and support insertion heuristics, including
insertion-based Large Neighborhood Search. We provide a clear definition of
their domain, update operations, and introduce consistency levels for
constraints on this domain. An implementation is described with the underlying
data structures required for integrating sequence variables into existing
trail-based CP solvers. Furthermore, global constraints specifically designed
for sequence variables and vehicle routing are introduced. Finally, the
effectiveness of sequence variables is demonstrated by simplifying problem
modeling and achieving competitive computational performance on the Dial-a-Ride
Problem.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文综述了基于大语言模型（LLM）的智能体系统在放射学中的应用，探讨了如何通过外部工具和反馈机制增强LLM能力，实现从半自动化工作流到自适应智能体的不同自主程度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 放射学具有多模态数据流和复杂工作流程的特点，非常适合应用能够适应上下文并自动化复杂任务的智能体系统。虽然LLM在单个任务上表现良好，但单独使用未能充分发挥其在复杂多步骤工作流程中的潜力。

Method: 通过为LLM配备外部工具和反馈机制，使其能够驱动表现出不同自主程度的系统，从半自动化工作流到能够管理复杂过程的自适应智能体。

Result: LLM驱动的智能体系统在放射学中显示出应用潜力，能够处理信息提取、报告总结等任务，并在复杂工作流程中发挥作用。

Conclusion: LLM驱动的智能体系统为放射学提供了新的自动化可能性，但仍面临错误级联、工具使用效率和医疗IT集成等挑战，需要进一步研究和评估方法的发展。

Abstract: Building agents, systems that perceive and act upon their environment with a
degree of autonomy, has long been a focus of AI research. This pursuit has
recently become vastly more practical with the emergence of large language
models (LLMs) capable of using natural language to integrate information,
follow instructions, and perform forms of "reasoning" and planning across a
wide range of tasks. With its multimodal data streams and orchestrated
workflows spanning multiple systems, radiology is uniquely suited to benefit
from agents that can adapt to context and automate repetitive yet complex
tasks. In radiology, LLMs and their multimodal variants have already
demonstrated promising performance for individual tasks such as information
extraction and report summarization. However, using LLMs in isolation
underutilizes their potential to support complex, multi-step workflows where
decisions depend on evolving context from multiple information sources.
Equipping LLMs with external tools and feedback mechanisms enables them to
drive systems that exhibit a spectrum of autonomy, ranging from semi-automated
workflows to more adaptive agents capable of managing complex processes. This
review examines the design of such LLM-driven agentic systems, highlights key
applications, discusses evaluation methods for planning and tool use, and
outlines challenges such as error cascades, tool-use efficiency, and health IT
integration.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出API优先、可编程的数据湖仓为AI驱动的自动化工作流提供了安全设计的基础设施，通过数据分支和声明式环境实现不可信AI代理在生产数据上的安全操作。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数据湖仓运行敏感工作负载，AI驱动的自动化引发了关于信任、正确性和治理的担忧，需要安全的设计方案。

Method: 使用Bauplan作为案例研究，采用数据分支和声明式环境，结合受证明携带代码启发的正确性检查，让AI代理修复数据管道。

Result: 原型系统证明不可信的AI代理可以在生产数据上安全操作，并展示了实现完全代理化湖仓的路径。

Conclusion: API优先、可编程的湖仓为安全设计的代理工作流提供了合适的抽象，通过数据分支和声明式环境实现可复现性和可观测性，同时减少攻击面。

Abstract: Data lakehouses run sensitive workloads, where AI-driven automation raises
concerns about trust, correctness, and governance. We argue that API-first,
programmable lakehouses provide the right abstractions for safe-by-design,
agentic workflows. Using Bauplan as a case study, we show how data branching
and declarative environments extend naturally to agents, enabling
reproducibility and observability while reducing the attack surface. We present
a proof-of-concept in which agents repair data pipelines using correctness
checks inspired by proof-carrying code. Our prototype demonstrates that
untrusted AI agents can operate safely on production data and outlines a path
toward a fully agentic lakehouse.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GraphMERT是一个小型图形编码器模型，通过从非结构化文本语料库中提取高质量知识图谱，构建了首个高效可扩展的神经符号AI堆栈，在准确性和符号表示方面均优于基线模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决神经符号AI框架难以扩展的问题，以及神经方法隐式表示和近似推理导致的解释性和可信度限制。知识图谱作为显式语义知识的黄金标准表示可以解决符号方面的问题，但从文本语料库自动推导可靠知识图谱仍是一个开放问题。

Method: 引入GraphMERT，一个小型图形编码器模型，从非结构化文本语料库及其内部表示中提取高质量知识图谱。GraphMERT及其等效知识图谱形成模块化神经符号堆栈：神经学习抽象，符号知识图谱用于可验证推理。

Result: 在糖尿病PubMed论文文本上，80M参数的GraphMERT生成的知识图谱达到69.8%的事实得分，而32B参数的基线LLM仅达到40.2%。GraphMERT知识图谱的有效性得分为68.8%，而LLM基线为43.0%。

Conclusion: GraphMERT + KG是首个高效可扩展的神经符号模型，在基准测试准确性和符号表示方面均达到最先进水平，相对于基线具有优越性。

Abstract: Researchers have pursued neurosymbolic artificial intelligence (AI)
applications for nearly three decades because symbolic components provide
abstraction while neural components provide generalization. Thus, a marriage of
the two components can lead to rapid advancements in AI. Yet, the field has not
realized this promise since most neurosymbolic AI frameworks fail to scale. In
addition, the implicit representations and approximate reasoning of neural
approaches limit interpretability and trust. Knowledge graphs (KGs), a
gold-standard representation of explicit semantic knowledge, can address the
symbolic side. However, automatically deriving reliable KGs from text corpora
has remained an open problem. We address these challenges by introducing
GraphMERT, a tiny graphical encoder-only model that distills high-quality KGs
from unstructured text corpora and its own internal representations. GraphMERT
and its equivalent KG form a modular neurosymbolic stack: neural learning of
abstractions; symbolic KGs for verifiable reasoning. GraphMERT + KG is the
first efficient and scalable neurosymbolic model to achieve state-of-the-art
benchmark accuracy along with superior symbolic representations relative to
baselines.
  Concretely, we target reliable domain-specific KGs that are both (1) factual
(with provenance) and (2) valid (ontology-consistent relations with
domain-appropriate semantics). When a large language model (LLM), e.g.,
Qwen3-32B, generates domain-specific KGs, it falls short on reliability due to
prompt sensitivity, shallow domain expertise, and hallucinated relations. On
text obtained from PubMed papers on diabetes, our 80M-parameter GraphMERT
yields a KG with a 69.8% FActScore; a 32B-parameter baseline LLM yields a KG
that achieves only 40.2% FActScore. The GraphMERT KG also attains a higher
ValidityScore of 68.8%, versus 43.0% for the LLM baseline.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LiveOIBench是一个包含403个奥林匹克级编程竞赛题目的基准测试，每个题目平均有60个专家设计的测试用例，用于评估大语言模型的编程能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前编码基准测试存在挑战性问题不足、测试用例覆盖不充分、依赖在线平台API等问题，需要更全面且易于访问的评估工具。

Method: 从72个2023-2025年官方信息学奥林匹克竞赛中收集403个专家策划的高质量题目，每个题目配备详细子任务评分标准和大量私有测试用例，并集成精英选手表现数据进行对比。

Result: GPT-5达到81.76百分位，表现强劲但仍不及顶尖人类选手（通常超过90百分位）；开源推理模型GPT-OSS-120B仅达60百分位，与前沿闭源模型存在显著差距。

Conclusion: 稳健的推理模型应优先精确问题分析而非过度探索，未来模型应强调结构化分析并减少不必要的探索。所有数据、代码和排行榜结果将公开。

Abstract: Competitive programming problems increasingly serve as valuable benchmarks to
evaluate the coding capabilities of large language models (LLMs) due to their
complexity and ease of verification. Yet, current coding benchmarks face
limitations such as lack of exceptionally challenging problems, insufficient
test case coverage, reliance on online platform APIs that limit accessibility.
To address these issues, we introduce LiveOIBench, a comprehensive benchmark
featuring 403 expert-curated Olympiad-level competitive programming problems,
each with an average of 60 expert-designed test cases. The problems are sourced
directly from 72 official Informatics Olympiads in different regions conducted
between 2023 and 2025. LiveOIBench distinguishes itself through four key
features: (1) meticulously curated high-quality tasks with detailed subtask
rubrics and extensive private test cases; (2) direct integration of elite
contestant performance data to enable informative comparison against
top-performing humans; (3) planned continuous, contamination-free updates from
newly released Olympiad problems; and (4) a self-contained evaluation system
facilitating offline and easy-to-reproduce assessments. Benchmarking 32 popular
general-purpose and reasoning LLMs, we find that GPT-5 achieves a notable
81.76th percentile, a strong result that nonetheless falls short of top human
contestant performance, who usually place above 90th. In contrast, among
open-weight reasoning models, GPT-OSS-120B achieves only a 60th percentile,
underscoring significant capability disparities from frontier closed models.
Detailed analyses indicate that robust reasoning models prioritize precise
problem analysis over excessive exploration, suggesting future models should
emphasize structured analysis and minimize unnecessary exploration. All data,
code, and leaderboard results will be made publicly available on our website.

Conclusion: 通过实施策划和控制评估，可以前瞻性地保障AI模型的可靠性和可治理性，从而有效应对由模型错位带来的国家安全风险。

Abstract: This memorandum presents four recommendations aimed at strengthening the
principles of AI model reliability and AI model governability, as DoW, ODNI,
NIST, and CAISI refine AI assurance frameworks under the AI Action Plan. Our
focus concerns the open scientific problem of misalignment and its implications
on AI model behavior. Specifically, misalignment and scheming capabilities can
be a red flag indicating AI model insufficient reliability and governability.
To address the national security threats arising from misalignment, we
recommend that DoW and the IC strategically leverage existing testing and
evaluation pipelines and their OT authority to future proof the principles of
AI model reliability and AI model governability through a suite of scheming and
control evaluations.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个多面体框架来分析计算领域教师指导学生研究者的角色，挑战了传统的单一指导概念，揭示了教师职责的复杂性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统上使用'指导'或'辅导'等单一术语来描述教师对学生研究者的指导工作，但这些术语掩盖了指导关系的复杂性，无法充分反映教师的多元职责。

Method: 采用多面体框架分析教师指导学生研究者的角色，创建了一个角色清单，通过扩展和澄清指导语言来揭示教师对学生研究者的全部责任范围。

Result: 该框架揭示了教师指导职责的完整广度，便于讨论不同职责之间的冲突，并为学生提供了更灵活的支持网络，同时不暗示个别教师技能的不足。

Conclusion: 过度依赖单一指导术语会掩盖教师职责的全貌并阻碍技能改进，多面体框架为教师、机构和学生提供了实用的应用建议。

Abstract: Computing faculty at research universities are often expected to guide the
work of undergraduate and graduate student researchers. This guidance is
typically called advising or mentoring, but these terms belie the complexity of
the relationship, which includes several related but distinct roles. I examine
the guidance of student researchers in computing (abbreviated to research
guidance or guidance throughout) within a facet framework, creating an
inventory of roles that faculty members can hold. By expanding and
disambiguating the language of guidance, this approach reveals the full breadth
of faculty responsibilities toward student researchers, and it facilitates
discussing conflicts between those responsibilities. Additionally, the facet
framework permits greater flexibility for students seeking guidance, allowing
them a robust support network without implying inadequacy in an individual
faculty member's skills. I further argue that an over-reliance on singular
terms like advising or mentoring for the guidance of student researchers
obscures the full scope of faculty responsibilities and interferes with
improvement of those as skills. Finally, I provide suggestions for how the
facet framework can be utilized by faculty and institutions, and how parts of
it can be discussed with students for their benefit.

Conclusion: GBA-UBF数据集为建筑级功能分类建立了可复现框架，弥合了粗粒度土地利用地图与细粒度城市分析之间的差距，并将基于社区反馈持续改进和更新。

Abstract: Rapid urbanization in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA)
has created urgent demand for high-resolution, building-level functional data
to support sustainable spatial planning. Existing land use datasets suffer from
coarse granularity and difficulty in capturing intra-block heterogeneity. To
this end, we present the Greater Bay Area Urban Building Function Dataset
(GBA-UBF), a large-scale, fine-grained dataset that assigns one of five
functional categories to nearly four million buildings across six core GBA
cities. We proposed a Multi-level Building Function Optimization (ML-BFO)
method by integrating Points of Interest (POI) records and building footprints
through a three-stage pipeline: (1) candidate label generation using spatial
overlay with proximity weighting, (2) iterative refinement based on
neighborhood label autocorrelation, and (3) function-related correction
informed by High-level POI buffers. To quantitatively validate results, we
design the Building Function Matching Index (BFMI), which jointly measures
categorical consistency and distributional similarity against POI-derived
probability heatmaps. Comparative experiments demonstrate that GBA-UBF achieves
significantly higher accuracy, with a BMFI of 0.58. This value markedly exceeds
that of the baseline dataset and exhibits superior alignment with urban
activity patterns. Field validation further confirms the dataset's semantic
reliability and practical interpretability. The GBA-UBF dataset establishes a
reproducible framework for building-level functional classification, bridging
the gap between coarse land use maps and fine-grained urban analytics. The
dataset is accessible at https://github.com/chenchs0629/GBA-UBF, and the data
will undergo continuous improvement and updates based on feedback from the
community.

Abstract: As Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies continue to advance, protecting
human autonomy and promoting ethical decision-making are essential to fostering
trust and accountability. Human agency (the capacity of individuals to make
informed decisions) should be actively preserved and reinforced by AI systems.
This paper examines strategies for designing AI systems that uphold fundamental
rights, strengthen human agency, and embed effective human oversight
mechanisms. It discusses key oversight models, including Human-in-Command
(HIC), Human-in-the-Loop (HITL), and Human-on-the-Loop (HOTL), and proposes a
risk-based framework to guide the implementation of these mechanisms. By
linking the level of AI model risk to the appropriate form of human oversight,
the paper underscores the critical role of human involvement in the responsible
deployment of AI, balancing technological innovation with the protection of
individual values and rights. In doing so, it aims to ensure that AI
technologies are used responsibly, safeguarding individual autonomy while
maximizing societal benefits.

Motivation: 新冠疫情成为测试非传统数据在公共卫生决策中应用的重要案例，研究旨在评估这类数据在疫情准备和应对中的价值与局限，并基于专家研讨会和调查提出改进建议。

Method: 通过2024年专家研讨会（汇集公共卫生、学术界、政策制定者和行业代表）和针对欧洲建模师的定向调查，收集疫情期间数据使用障碍的证据。

Result: 研究发现数据访问、质量和互操作性持续存在问题，约66%的数据集存在访问问题，非传统数据共享不情愿程度是传统数据的两倍（30% vs 15%），仅10%的受访者能使用所有需要的数据。

Conclusion: 建议针对第一英里挑战建立技术和法律数据访问框架，针对最后一英里挑战建立融合中心、决策加速实验室和科学大使网络，实现非传统数据的全部价值需要持续投资于机构准备、跨部门合作和数据团结文化。

Abstract: The pandemic served as an important test case of complementing traditional
public health data with non-traditional data (NTD) such as mobility traces,
social media activity, and wearables data to inform decision-making. Drawing on
an expert workshop and a targeted survey of European modelers, we assess the
promise and persistent limitations of such data in pandemic preparedness and
response. We distinguish between "first-mile" (accessing and harmonizing data)
and "last-mile" challenges (translating insights into actionable
interventions). The expert workshop held in 2024 brought together participants
from public health, academia, policymakers, and industry to reflect on lessons
learned and define strategies for translating NTD insights into policy making.
The survey offers evidence of the barriers faced during COVID-19 and highlights
key data unavailability and underuse. Our findings reveal ongoing issues with
data access, quality, and interoperability, as well as institutional and
cognitive barriers to evidence-based decision-making. Around 66% of datasets
suffered access problem, with data sharing reluctance for NTD being double that
of traditional data (30% vs 15%). Only 10% reported they could use all the data
they needed. We propose a set of recommendations: for first-mile challenges,
solutions focus on technical and legal frameworks for data access.; for
last-mile challenges, we recommend fusion centers, decision accelerator labs,
and networks of scientific ambassadors to bridge the gap between analysis and
action. Realizing the full value of NTD requires a sustained investment in
institutional readiness, cross-sectoral collaboration, and a shift toward a
culture of data solidarity. Grounded in the lessons of COVID-19, the article
can be used to design a roadmap for using NTD to confront a broader array of
public health emergencies, from climate shocks to humanitarian crises.

Abstract: Connected health is a multidisciplinary approach focused on health
management, prioritizing pa-tient needs in the creation of tools, services, and
treatments. This paradigm ensures proactive and efficient care by facilitating
the timely exchange of accurate patient information among all stake-holders in
the care continuum. The rise of digital technologies and process innovations
promises to enhance connected health by integrating various healthcare data
sources. This integration aims to personalize care, predict health outcomes,
and streamline patient management, though challeng-es remain, particularly in
data architecture, application interoperability, and security. Data analytics
can provide critical insights for informed decision-making and health
co-creation, but solutions must prioritize end-users, including patients and
healthcare professionals. This perspective was explored through an agile System
Development Lifecycle in an EU-funded project aimed at developing an integrated
AI-generated solution for managing cancer patients undergoing immunotherapy.
This paper contributes with a collaborative digital framework integrating
stakeholders across the care continuum, leveraging federated big data analytics
and artificial intelligence for improved decision-making while ensuring
privacy. Analytical capabilities, such as treatment recommendations and adverse
event predictions, were validated using real-life data, achieving 70%-90%
accuracy in a pilot study with the medical partners, demonstrating the
framework's effectiveness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在AI教育创新时代，需要在向学生暴露新设计前评估其发展后果，因为这类干预可能带来不可逆影响，必须预见潜在益处和危害。

Method: 基于大语言模型构建学生发展代理框架，通过多智能体学习环境的案例研究验证方法有效性。

Result: 代理预测结果与真实学生在非认知发展方面的结果一致，表明基于LLM的模拟有望高效且符合伦理地评估AI教育创新。

Conclusion: LLM模拟在教育创新评估中具有潜力，未来方向包括增强档案结构、整合微调模型、验证实证发现效果、解释模拟数据和优化评估方法。

Abstract: In the age of AI-powered educational (AIED) innovation, evaluating the
developmental consequences of novel designs before they are exposed to students
has become both essential and challenging. Since such interventions may carry
irreversible effects, it is critical to anticipate not only potential benefits
but also possible harms. This study proposes a student development agent
framework based on large language models (LLMs), designed to simulate how
students with diverse characteristics may evolve under different educational
settings without administering them to real students. By validating the
approach through a case study on a multi-agent learning environment (MAIC), we
demonstrate that the agent's predictions align with real student outcomes in
non-cognitive developments. The results suggest that LLM-based simulations hold
promise for evaluating AIED innovations efficiently and ethically. Future
directions include enhancing profile structures, incorporating fine-tuned or
small task-specific models, validating effects of empirical findings,
interpreting simulated data and optimizing evaluation methods.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 网络钓鱼攻击是全球性的重大网络安全威胁，需要了解特定人群的易感性特征以制定针对性防护措施。

Method: 通过便利抽样收集数据，共有164人完成问卷调查，分析人口统计因素、技术能力、使用习惯、过往受害经历和邮件特征的影响。

Result: 男性、25岁以上、在职人员、频繁网购者易感性较高；权威和紧急邮件特征增加受骗风险；用户对Gmail和LinkedIn等通信服务邮件更易受骗。

Conclusion: 需要针对特定人群和邮件类型制定安全意识干预措施，结合技术和教育的多层面方法对打击网络钓鱼攻击至关重要。

Abstract: Phishing attacks pose a significant cybersecurity threat globally. This study
investigates phishing susceptibility within the Pakistani population, examining
the influence of demographic factors, technological aptitude and usage,
previous phishing victimization, and email characteristics. Data was collected
through convenient sampling; a total of 164 people completed the questionnaire.
Contrary to some assumptions, the results indicate that men, individuals over
25, employed persons and frequent online shoppers have relatively high phishing
susceptibility. The characteristics of email significantly affected phishing
victimization, with authority and urgency signaling increasing susceptibility,
while risk cues sometimes improved vigilance. In particular, users were more
susceptible to emails from communication services such as Gmail and LinkedIn
compared to government or social media sources. These findings highlight the
need for targeted security awareness interventions tailored to specific
demographics and email types. A multifaceted approach combining technology and
education is crucial to combat phishing attacks.

Abstract: Vehicular Ad-hoc Networks (VANETs) have seen significant advancements in
technology. Innovation in connectivity and communication has brought
substantial capabilities to various components of VANETs such as vehicles,
infrastructures, passengers, drivers and affiliated environmental sensors.
Internet of Things (IoT) has brought the notion of Internet of Vehicles (IoV)
to VANETs where each component of VANET is connected directly or indirectly to
the Internet. Vehicles and infrastructures are key components of a VANET system
that can greatly augment the overall experience of the network by integrating
the competencies of Vehicle to Vehicle (V2V), Vehicle to Pedestrian (V2P),
Vehicle to Sensor (V2S), Vehicle to Infrastructure (V2I) and Infrastructure to
Infrastructure (I2I). Internet connectivity in Vehicles and Infrastructures has
immensely expanded the potential of developing applications for VANETs under
the broad spectrum of IoV. Advent in the use of technology in VANETs requires
considerable efforts in scheming the ethical rules for autonomous systems.
Currently, there is a gap in literature that focuses on the challenges involved
in designing ethical rules or policies for infrastructures, sometimes referred
to as Road Side Units (RSUs) for IoVs. This paper highlights the key challenges
entailing the design of ethical rules for RSUs in IoV systems. Furthermore, the
article also proposes major ethical principles for RSUs in IoV systems that
would set foundation for modeling future IoV architectures.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly transforming power electronics, with
AI-related publications in IEEE Power Electronics Society selected journals
increasing more than fourfold from 2020 to 2025. However, the ethical
dimensions of this transformation have received limited attention. This article
underscores the urgent need for an ethical framework to guide responsible AI
integration in power electronics, not only to prevent AI-related incidents but
also to comply with legal and regulatory responsibilities. In this context,
this article identifies four core pillars of AI ethics in power electronics:
Security & Safety, Explainability & Transparency, Energy Sustainability, and
Evolving Roles of Engineers. Each pillar is supported by practical and
actionable insights to ensure that ethical principles are embedded in algorithm
design, system deployment, and workforce development. The authors advocate for
power electronics engineers to lead the ethical discourse, given their deep
technical understanding of both AI systems and power conversion technologies.
The paper concludes by calling on the IEEE Power Electronics Society to
spearhead the establishment of ethical standards and best practices that ensure
AI innovations are not only technically advanced but also trustworthy, safe,
and sustainable.

### [150] [Energy-Driven Steering: Reducing False Refusals in Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08646)
*Eric Hanchen Jiang,Weixuan Ou,Run Liu,Shengyuan Pang,Guancheng Wan,Ranjie Duan,Wei Dong,Kai-Wei Chang,XiaoFeng Wang,Ying Nian Wu,Xinfeng Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为能量驱动引导(EDS)的无微调框架，通过推理时动态干预来解决大语言模型安全对齐中的过度拒绝问题，在保持安全性的同时显著降低误拒率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型安全对齐技术往往只关注提升对有害提示的安全性，导致模型变得过度谨慎，拒绝响应良性提示。因此需要在增强安全性的同时减少误拒率。

Method: 训练一个轻量级的外部能量模型(EBM)，为不良状态(误拒或越狱)分配高能量，为理想状态(有帮助的响应或安全拒绝)分配低能量。在推理时，通过能量函数的梯度动态引导LLM的隐藏状态到低能量区域。

Result: 在广泛模型上的实验表明，该方法显著降低了误拒率，例如在ORB-H基准上将合规率从57.3%提升到82.6%，同时保持基线安全性能。

Conclusion: EDS提供了一种有效的范式，用于构建同时具有低误拒率和高安全性的大语言模型，将行为控制与模型核心知识解耦，提供灵活的解决方案。

Abstract: Safety alignment of large language models (LLMs) faces a key challenge:
current alignment techniques often only focus on improving safety against
harmful prompts, causing LLMs to become over-cautious and refuse to respond to
benign prompts. Therefore, a key objective of safe alignment is to enhance
safety while simultaneously reducing false refusals. In this paper, we
introduce Energy-Driven Steering (EDS), a novel, fine-tuning free framework
designed to resolve this challenge through dynamic, inference-time
intervention. We trained a lightweight, external Energy-Based Model (EBM) to
assign high energy to undesirable (false refusal or jailbreak) states and low
energy to desirable (helpful response or safe reject) ones. During inference,
EBM maps the LLM's internal activations to an "energy landscape". We use the
gradient of the energy function to dynamically steer the LLM's hidden states to
low energy regions, correcting the model to generate a desirable response in
real-time without modifying its weights. This method decouples behavioral
control from the model's core knowledge, offering a flexible solution with
minimal computational overhead. Extensive experiments across a wide range of
models show our method successfully achieves this objective: it substantially
lowers false refusal rates. For example, raising compliance on the ORB-H
benchmark from 57.3% to 82.6% while maintaining the baseline safety
performance. Our work presents an effective paradigm for building LLMs that
achieve both low false refusal rates and high safety.

TL;DR: 提出基于基函数预训练的可重用初始化框架，通过预训练基神经网络来近似多项式函数，然后将其参数用于初始化更复杂目标函数的网络，显著提升训练效率、泛化能力和模型可迁移性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决神经网络函数逼近面临的三大挑战：(i)每个目标函数都需要从头训练新模型；(ii)性能对架构和超参数选择高度敏感；(iii)模型在训练域外泛化能力差。

Method: 采用基函数预训练方法，先在参考域上训练基神经网络来近似多项式函数族，然后使用学习到的参数初始化复杂目标函数的网络，并引入域映射机制将任意域输入变换到参考域。

Result: 在一维和二维设置下的广泛数值实验显示，该方法在训练效率、泛化能力和模型可迁移性方面都有显著提升。

Conclusion: 基于初始化的策略为可扩展和模块化的神经函数逼近提供了有前景的解决方案，完整代码已在Gitee公开。

Abstract: Neural network-based function approximation plays a pivotal role in the
advancement of scientific computing and machine learning. Yet, training such
models faces several challenges: (i) each target function often requires
training a new model from scratch; (ii) performance is highly sensitive to
architectural and hyperparameter choices; and (iii) models frequently
generalize poorly beyond the training domain. To overcome these challenges, we
propose a reusable initialization framework based on basis function
pretraining. In this approach, basis neural networks are first trained to
approximate families of polynomials on a reference domain. Their learned
parameters are then used to initialize networks for more complex target
functions. To enhance adaptability across arbitrary domains, we further
introduce a domain mapping mechanism that transforms inputs into the reference
domain, thereby preserving structural correspondence with the pretrained
models. Extensive numerical experiments in one- and two-dimensional settings
demonstrate substantial improvements in training efficiency, generalization,
and model transferability, highlighting the promise of initialization-based
strategies for scalable and modular neural function approximation. The full
code is made publicly available on Gitee.

*Edward Y. Chang,Ethan Y. Chang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: WILSON是一个轻量级诊断工具，用于检测大语言模型在无害编辑下的输出不稳定性问题，如RAG段落重排序、微调、思维链等场景中的路径依赖问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在实际应用中存在输出不稳定的问题：RAG输出随段落重排序而翻转，微调会侵蚀预训练学到的恒定性，思维链等提示方法存在路径依赖。这些违反预期恒定的问题会破坏持续集成，迫使团队在安全性和速度之间权衡。

Method: WILSON通过简单的循环和重排序检查内部表示来生成系统信号。它结合了基于位置和层的无逆曲率映射（使用JVP和Hutchinson探针计算）以及激活级交换子来标记重排序风险。

Result: WILSON信号计算成本低，适用于标准Transformer模型，可输出阈值和CSV文件供编排器使用。能够保护RAG免受顺序效应影响，捕获微调回归，稳定辩论路径和长多轮上下文，并在部署中控制融合或重排序。

Conclusion: WILSON帮助预测故障并批准安全优化，使得可靠性和吞吐量能够同时提升，而无需改变模型架构或训练过程。

Abstract: Large language models can change answers under harmless edits that matter in
practice: RAG outputs flip when passages are reordered, fine-tuning erodes
invariances learned at pretraining, debate or chain-of-thought prompts take
path-dependent routes, and compiler fusion or reordering perturbs logits near
decision boundaries. These failures violate intended invariances, break
continuous integration, and force teams to trade safety for speed. The effects
are small yet distributed across layers and positions, sensitive to context
length and evaluation order, and costly to repair with retraining or formal
verification. We present WILSON, a minimal post-hoc diagnostic suite that
converts simple loop and reordering checks on internal representations into
system signals. WILSON combines an inverse-free curvature map over positions
and layers, computed with JVPs and Hutchinson probes, with activation-level
commutators that flag reorder risk. Signals are cheap to compute,
model-agnostic for standard Transformers, and exported as thresholds and CSV
artifacts for orchestrators. This enables concrete actions: guard RAG against
order effects, catch fine-tuning regressions, stabilize debate pathways and
long multi-turn contexts, and gate fusions or reorders in deployment. In short,
WILSON helps anticipate failures and approve safe optimizations so reliability
and throughput can improve together without changing model architecture or
training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Modelica模型中的代数环会显著增加仿真时间，且存在多解模糊问题，需要一种高效的替代方法。

Method: 使用前馈神经网络，在损失函数中直接使用代数环的残差进行训练，无需监督数据，通过残差训练策略确保收敛到一致解。

Result: 在IEEE 14-Bus系统测试中，仿真时间减少60%，同时通过误差控制机制保持了与传统仿真相同的精度水平。

Conclusion: 该方法成功解决了代数环的多解模糊问题，显著提升了仿真效率，为大规模系统仿真提供了有效的神经网络替代方案。

Abstract: This paper presents a residual-informed machine learning approach for
replacing algebraic loops in equation-based Modelica models with neural network
surrogates. A feedforward neural network is trained using the residual (error)
of the algebraic loop directly in its loss function, eliminating the need for a
supervised dataset. This training strategy also resolves the issue of ambiguous
solutions, allowing the surrogate to converge to a consistent solution rather
than averaging multiple valid ones. Applied to the large-scale IEEE 14-Bus
system, our method achieves a 60% reduction in simulation time compared to
conventional simulations, while maintaining the same level of accuracy through
error control mechanisms.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 罕见遗传病诊断面临三大挑战：患者数据不足、全基因组测序难以获取、致病基因数量庞大，导致诊断周期长、治疗不当，特别是在资源有限地区问题更为严重。

Method: 提出RareNet，一种基于子图的图神经网络方法，仅使用患者表型数据来识别致病基因并检索相关患者子图，可作为独立方法或与其他候选基因优先排序方法的预处理/后处理过滤器。

Result: 在两个生物医学数据集上的综合评估显示，RareNet在致病基因预测方面具有竞争力和鲁棒性，与其他框架集成时能显著提升性能。

Conclusion: RareNet仅需表型数据即可实现复杂遗传分析，特别适合缺乏先进基因组基础设施的服务不足人群，有助于实现遗传分析的民主化。

Abstract: Rare genetic disease diagnosis faces critical challenges: insufficient
patient data, inaccessible full genome sequencing, and the immense number of
possible causative genes. These limitations cause prolonged diagnostic
journeys, inappropriate treatments, and critical delays, disproportionately
affecting patients in resource-limited settings where diagnostic tools are
scarce. We propose RareNet, a subgraph-based Graph Neural Network that requires
only patient phenotypes to identify the most likely causal gene and retrieve
focused patient subgraphs for targeted clinical investigation. RareNet can
function as a standalone method or serve as a pre-processing or post-processing
filter for other candidate gene prioritization methods, consistently enhancing
their performance while potentially enabling explainable insights. Through
comprehensive evaluation on two biomedical datasets, we demonstrate competitive
and robust causal gene prediction and significant performance gains when
integrated with other frameworks. By requiring only phenotypic data, which is
readily available in any clinical setting, RareNet democratizes access to
sophisticated genetic analysis, offering particular value for underserved
populations lacking advanced genomic infrastructure.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界时间序列具有复杂的非平稳特性，会导致分布偏移，现有实例归一化技术无法处理实例内的分布偏移，导致性能不佳。

Method: 提出两种点级方法：学习分布(LD)通过在不同时间步使用不同参数拟合输入和输出的内部分布；学习条件分布(LCD)使用神经网络预测输出的缩放系数。

Result: 在多个公共基准测试中，使用不同骨干模型评估了两种方法的性能，通过对比实验证明了点级范式的有效性。

Conclusion: 点级方法能够有效解决时间序列预测中的实例内分布偏移问题，提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Real-world time series are influenced by numerous factors and exhibit complex
non-stationary characteristics. Non-stationarity can lead to distribution
shifts, where the statistical properties of time series change over time,
negatively impacting model performance. Several instance normalization
techniques have been proposed to address distribution shifts in time series
forecasting. However, existing methods fail to account for shifts within
individual instances, leading to suboptimal performance. To tackle
inner-instance distribution shifts, we propose two novel point-level methods:
Learning Distribution (LD) and Learning Conditional Distribution (LCD). LD
eliminates internal discrepancies by fitting the internal distribution of input
and output with different parameters at different time steps, while LCD
utilizes neural networks to predict scaling coefficients of the output. We
evaluate the performance of the two methods with various backbone models across
public benchmarks and demonstrate the effectiveness of the point-level paradigm
through comparative experiments.

Conclusion: LeFCert是首个为语言赋能基础模型设计的可证明鲁棒少样本分类器，在中毒攻击下提供形式化保证，兼具高性能和实用性。

Abstract: Language-empowered foundation models (LeFMs), such as CLIP and GraphCLIP,
have transformed multimodal learning by aligning visual (or graph) features
with textual representations, enabling powerful downstream capabilities like
few-shot learning. However, the reliance on small, task-specific support
datasets collected in open environments exposes these models to poisoning
attacks, where adversaries manipulate the support samples to degrade
performance. Existing defenses rely on empirical strategies, which lack formal
guarantees and remain vulnerable to unseen and adaptive attacks. Certified
robustness offers provable guarantees but has been largely unexplored for
few-shot classifiers based on LeFMs. This study seeks to fill these critical
gaps by proposing the first provably robust few-shot classifier that is
tailored for LeFMs. We term our model Language-empowered Few-shot Certification
(\textbf{LeFCert}). It integrates both textual and feature embeddings with an
adaptive blending mechanism. To achieve provable robustness, we propose a
twofold trimmed mean prototype and derive provable upper and lower bounds for
classification scores, enabling certification under worst-case poisoning
scenarios. To further enhance the performance, we extend LeFCert with two
variants by considering a more realistic and tighter attack budget: LeFCert-L
incorporates randomized smoothing to provide Lipschitz continuity and derive
robustness under dual budget constraints, and LeFCert-C provides collective
certification for scenarios where attackers distribute a shared poisoning
budget across multiple samples. Experiments demonstrate that LeFCert achieves
state-of-the-art performance, significantly improving both clean and certified
accuracy compared to existing baselines. Despite its advanced robustness
mechanisms, LeFCert is computationally efficient, making it practical for
real-world applications.

TL;DR: 论文分析了高维数据可视化中常用的质量指标（标准化应力和KL散度）对尺度缩放敏感的问题，提出了使这些指标尺度不变的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高维数据可视化中常用的质量指标对均匀缩放敏感，即使缩放不会改变投影的本质特征，这影响了降维技术的准确评估。

Method: 通过分析和实证研究尺度缩放对应力和KL散度的影响，提出了一种简单技术使这两个指标具有尺度不变性。

Result: 研究表明尺度缩放会显著改变质量指标值，影响降维技术评估；提出的尺度不变方法在小基准测试中能准确捕捉预期行为。

Conclusion: 现有可视化质量指标对尺度缩放敏感，提出的尺度不变方法能更准确地评估降维投影的质量。

Abstract: Complex, high-dimensional data is ubiquitous across many scientific
disciplines, including machine learning, biology, and the social sciences. One
of the primary methods of visualizing these datasets is with two-dimensional
scatter plots that visually capture some properties of the data. Because
visually determining the accuracy of these plots is challenging, researchers
often use quality metrics to measure the projection's accuracy and faithfulness
to the original data. One of the most commonly employed metrics, normalized
stress, is sensitive to uniform scaling (stretching, shrinking) of the
projection, despite this act not meaningfully changing anything about the
projection. Another quality metric, the Kullback--Leibler (KL) divergence used
in the popular t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) technique,
is also susceptible to this scale sensitivity. We investigate the effect of
scaling on stress and KL divergence analytically and empirically by showing
just how much the values change and how this affects dimension reduction
technique evaluations. We introduce a simple technique to make both metrics
scale-invariant and show that it accurately captures expected behavior on a
small benchmark.

Conclusion: CATS-Linear通过动态路由和架构重设计，证明了线性模型在时间序列预测中的强大潜力，为增强线性模型提供了有效方法。

Abstract: Recent research demonstrates that linear models achieve forecasting
performance competitive with complex architectures, yet methodologies for
enhancing linear models remain underexplored. Motivated by the hypothesis that
distinct time series instances may follow heterogeneous linear mappings, we
propose the Classification Auxiliary Trend-Seasonal Decoupling Linear Model
CATS-Linear, employing Classification Auxiliary Channel-Independence (CACI).
CACI dynamically routes instances to dedicated predictors via classification,
enabling supervised channel design. We further analyze the theoretical expected
risks of different channel settings. Additionally, we redesign the
trend-seasonal decomposition architecture by adding a decoupling -- linear
mapping -- recoupling framework for trend components and complex-domain linear
projections for seasonal components. Extensive experiments validate that
CATS-Linear with fixed hyperparameters achieves state-of-the-art accuracy
comparable to hyperparameter-tuned baselines while delivering SOTA accuracy
against fixed-hyperparameter counterparts.

We applied DPCformer to 13 traits across five crops (maize, cotton, tomato,
rice, chickpea). Our approach uses an 8-dimensional one-hot encoding for SNP
data, ordered by chromosome, and employs the PMF algorithm for feature
selection. Evaluations show DPCformer outperforms existing methods. In maize
datasets, accuracy for traits like days to tasseling and plant height improved
by up to 2.92%. For cotton, accuracy gains for fiber traits reached 8.37%. On
small-sample tomato data, the Pearson Correlation Coefficient for a key trait
increased by up to 57.35%. In chickpea, the yield correlation was boosted by
16.62%. DPCformer demonstrates superior accuracy, robustness in small-sample
scenarios, and enhanced interpretability, providing a powerful tool for
precision breeding and addressing global food security challenges.

*Moyu Zhang,Yun Chen,Yujun Jin,Jinxin Hu,Yu Zhang,Xiaoyi Zeng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出MATT模型无关测试时范式，利用特征组合置信度生成多推理路径，提升CTR模型预测性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注训练阶段优化，忽略了推理阶段的优化机会。罕见特征组合会降低预测性能，导致不可靠输出

Method: 使用分层概率哈希方法量化特征组合置信度，基于置信度采样生成多推理路径，聚合多路径预测结果

Result: 离线和在线A/B测试验证了MATT在现有CTR模型上的兼容性和有效性

Conclusion: MATT通过测试时优化解锁了已训练CTR模型的预测潜力，解决了罕见特征组合导致的低置信度问题

Abstract: Recently, a growing body of research has focused on either optimizing CTR
model architectures to better model feature interactions or refining training
objectives to aid parameter learning, thereby achieving better predictive
performance. However, previous efforts have primarily focused on the training
phase, largely neglecting opportunities for optimization during the inference
phase. Infrequently occurring feature combinations, in particular, can degrade
prediction performance, leading to unreliable or low-confidence outputs. To
unlock the predictive potential of trained CTR models, we propose a
Model-Agnostic Test-Time paradigm (MATT), which leverages the confidence scores
of feature combinations to guide the generation of multiple inference paths,
thereby mitigating the influence of low-confidence features on the final
prediction. Specifically, to quantify the confidence of feature combinations,
we introduce a hierarchical probabilistic hashing method to estimate the
occurrence frequencies of feature combinations at various orders, which serve
as their corresponding confidence scores. Then, using the confidence scores as
sampling probabilities, we generate multiple instance-specific inference paths
through iterative sampling and subsequently aggregate the prediction scores
from multiple paths to conduct robust predictions. Finally, extensive offline
experiments and online A/B tests strongly validate the compatibility and
effectiveness of MATT across existing CTR models.

TL;DR: 本文提出频率感知缓存(FreqCa)方法，通过分析扩散模型中不同频率分量的动态特性，对低频分量直接重用，对高频分量使用二阶Hermite插值器预测，显著降低扩散变换器的推理成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散变换器存在显著的推理成本问题。现有特征缓存方法假设相邻时间步的特征相似或连续，但这一假设并不总是成立。通过频域分析发现，不同频率分量在时间步间表现出不同的动态特性。

Method: 1. 频域分析揭示低频分量相似性高但连续性差，高频分量连续性好但相似性差；2. 提出FreqCa方法：低频分量直接重用，高频分量使用二阶Hermite插值器预测；3. 提出缓存累积残差特征(CRF)，将内存占用减少99%。

Result: 在FLUX.1-dev、FLUX.1-Kontext-dev、Qwen-Image和Qwen-Image-Edit数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法在生成和编辑任务中均有效。

Conclusion: 频率感知缓存方法通过利用不同频率分量的特性，有效降低了扩散变换器的推理成本，同时保持了生成质量。

Abstract: The application of diffusion transformers is suffering from their significant
inference costs. Recently, feature caching has been proposed to solve this
problem by reusing features from previous timesteps, thereby skipping
computation in future timesteps. However, previous feature caching assumes that
features in adjacent timesteps are similar or continuous, which does not always
hold in all settings. To investigate this, this paper begins with an analysis
from the frequency domain, which reveal that different frequency bands in the
features of diffusion models exhibit different dynamics across timesteps.
Concretely, low-frequency components, which decide the structure of images,
exhibit higher similarity but poor continuity. In contrast, the high-frequency
bands, which decode the details of images, show significant continuity but poor
similarity. These interesting observations motivate us to propose
Frequency-aware Caching (FreqCa)
  which directly reuses features of low-frequency components based on their
similarity, while using a second-order Hermite interpolator to predict the
volatile high-frequency ones based on its continuity.
  Besides, we further propose to cache Cumulative Residual Feature (CRF)
instead of the features in all the layers, which reduces the memory footprint
of feature caching by 99%.
  Extensive experiments on FLUX.1-dev, FLUX.1-Kontext-dev, Qwen-Image, and
Qwen-Image-Edit demonstrate its effectiveness in both generation and editing.
Codes are available in the supplementary materials and will be released on
GitHub.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出LENS方法改进GRPO算法，通过利用负样本组（没有正确答案的组）来提高强化学习效率，在MATH基准测试中显著优于基线


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GRPO算法在负样本组上浪费大量计算资源，因为这些组中所有采样响应都不正确，导致优势函数为零且没有梯度更新

Method: 从奖励建模的最大似然目标出发，推导出等价于修改后价值函数的策略梯度，为错误响应添加置信度加权的惩罚项，对更自信的错误施加更大惩罚

Result: 在MATH基准测试中使用Llama-3.1-8B和Qwen-2.5-3B模型，LENS方法始终优于GRPO基线，在更难的项目上获得显著提升

Conclusion: LENS提供了一种原则性且实用的方法来"挽救"负样本组，提高了RLVR的效率和性能

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has become a standard
recipe for improving large language models (LLMs) on reasoning tasks, with
Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) widely used in practice. Yet GRPO
wastes substantial compute on negative groups: groups in which no sampled
response is correct yield zero advantage and thus no gradient. We ask whether
negative groups can be leveraged without extra supervision. Starting from a
maximum-likelihood (MLE) objective in reward modeling, we show that the MLE
gradient is equivalent to a policy gradient for a modified value function. This
value function adds a confidence-weighted penalty on incorrect responses,
imposing larger penalties on more confident mistakes. We refer to this as
\textbf{L}ikelihood \textbf{E}stimation with \textbf{N}egative \textbf{S}amples
(\textbf{LENS}). LENS modifies GRPO to assign non-zero, confidence-dependent
rewards to incorrect generations, making negative groups informative and
converting previously wasted samples into useful gradient updates. On the MATH
benchmark with Llama-3.1-8B and Qwen-2.5-3B, the proposed variant consistently
outperforms GRPO baseline, with significant gains on harder items. These
results demonstrate a principled and practical way to "rescue" negative groups,
improving efficiency and performance in RLVR.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有ICL均衡器主要针对静态信道设计，缺乏对非平稳问题的理论研究和实际应用。本文旨在探索ICL在时变信道均衡中的潜力，解决传统监督学习方法需要昂贵重训练的问题。

Method: 采用原则性框架设计高效的注意力机制，从自适应信号处理算法（如LMS、LRMS）中推导新的注意力变体，利用多步梯度更新改进长期跟踪能力。

Result: 实验结果表明ICL在非平稳MIMO均衡中表现出强大潜力，基于经典自适应算法的注意力机制显著增强了动态环境中的适应性和性能。

Conclusion: ICL在非平稳信道均衡中具有重要应用价值，基于自适应算法的注意力机制设计为开发下一代具有更强适应性和鲁棒性的无线基础模型提供了关键见解。

Abstract: Channel equalization is fundamental for mitigating distortions such as
frequency-selective fading and inter-symbol interference. Unlike standard
supervised learning approaches that require costly retraining or fine-tuning
for each new task, in-context learning (ICL) adapts to new channels at
inference time with only a few examples. However, existing ICL-based equalizers
are primarily developed for and evaluated on static channels within the context
window. Indeed, to our knowledge, prior principled analyses and theoretical
studies of ICL focus exclusively on the stationary setting, where the function
remains fixed within the context. In this paper, we investigate the ability of
ICL to address non-stationary problems through the lens of time-varying channel
equalization. We employ a principled framework for designing efficient
attention mechanisms with improved adaptivity in non-stationary tasks,
leveraging algorithms from adaptive signal processing to guide better designs.
For example, new attention variants can be derived from the Least Mean Square
(LMS) adaptive algorithm, a Least Root Mean Square (LRMS) formulation for
enhanced robustness, or multi-step gradient updates for improved long-term
tracking. Experimental results demonstrate that ICL holds strong promise for
non-stationary MIMO equalization, and that attention mechanisms inspired by
classical adaptive algorithms can substantially enhance adaptability and
performance in dynamic environments. Our findings may provide critical insights
for developing next-generation wireless foundation models with stronger
adaptability and robustness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解交叉注意力在跨域序列推荐中的工作机制，超越传统的残差对齐解释，探索正交对齐现象及其对模型性能的影响。

Method: 通过300多次实验分析交叉注意力机制，研究查询输入与输出之间的正交性关系，验证正交对齐对模型性能的提升作用。

Result: 当查询输入与交叉注意力输出正交时，模型性能显著提升。包含交叉注意力模块的基线模型在参数匹配条件下表现更优，实现了更好的准确率-参数比。

Conclusion: 正交对齐现象自然出现且能改善缩放定律，为多模态研究中的参数高效缩放提供了新方向。

Abstract: Cross-domain sequential recommendation (CDSR) aims to align heterogeneous
user behavior sequences collected from different domains. While cross-attention
is widely used to enhance alignment and improve recommendation performance, its
underlying mechanism is not fully understood. Most researchers interpret
cross-attention as residual alignment, where the output is generated by
removing redundant and preserving non-redundant information from the query
input by referencing another domain data which is input key and value. Beyond
the prevailing view, we introduce Orthogonal Alignment, a phenomenon in which
cross-attention discovers novel information that is not present in the query
input, and further argue that those two contrasting alignment mechanisms can
co-exist in recommendation models We find that when the query input and output
of cross-attention are orthogonal, model performance improves over 300
experiments. Notably, Orthogonal Alignment emerges naturally, without any
explicit orthogonality constraints. Our key insight is that Orthogonal
Alignment emerges naturally because it improves scaling law. We show that
baselines additionally incorporating cross-attention module outperform
parameter-matched baselines, achieving a superior accuracy-per-model parameter.
We hope these findings offer new directions for parameter-efficient scaling in
multi-modal research.

This is typically achieved by generating two disparate views of each instance

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的反事实公平研究主要关注点预测器，而预测集在不确定性下的公平决策中至关重要。同时，保形预测虽然能提供有效的预测集，但不保证反事实公平性。

Method: 通过对称化保护属性干预的符合度分数来开发CF-CP方法，该方法保持保形预测的分布无关和有限样本有效性。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的实验表明，CF-CP实现了期望的反事实公平性，达到了目标覆盖率，且预测集大小仅有最小增加。

Conclusion: CF-CP为反事实公平的不确定性量化提供了一种简单、无需训练的途径。

Abstract: While counterfactual fairness of point predictors is well studied, its
extension to prediction sets--central to fair decision-making under
uncertainty--remains underexplored. On the other hand, conformal prediction
(CP) provides efficient, distribution-free, finite-sample valid prediction
sets, yet does not ensure counterfactual fairness. We close this gap by
developing Counterfactually Fair Conformal Prediction (CF-CP) that produces
counterfactually fair prediction sets. Through symmetrization of conformity
scores across protected-attribute interventions, we prove that CF-CP results in
counterfactually fair prediction sets while maintaining the marginal coverage
property. Furthermore, we empirically demonstrate that on both synthetic and
real datasets, across regression and classification tasks, CF-CP achieves the
desired counterfactual fairness and meets the target coverage rate with minimal
increase in prediction set size. CF-CP offers a simple, training-free route to
counterfactually fair uncertainty quantification.

Motivation: 现有工作主要关注全局极小极大最优性，但本文从局部视角出发，研究在固定分布P0邻域内的极小极大风险，这更适用于具有公开数据的隐私采样场景。

Method: 扩展了之前的工作，从纯LDP推广到功能性LDP框架，证明了全局最优功能性LDP采样器在P0邻域约束下也能产生局部最优采样器。

Result: 推导出了局部极小极大最优采样器的简单闭式表达式，该表达式不依赖于f-散度的选择，并在具有公开数据的隐私采样场景中实证优于全局极小极大采样器。

Conclusion: 局部框架为隐私采样提供了更精细的分析工具，特别是在具有公开数据的情况下，局部最优采样器能够显著优于全局方法。

Abstract: We study the problem of sampling from a distribution under local differential
privacy (LDP). Given a private distribution $P \in \mathcal{P}$, the goal is to
generate a single sample from a distribution that remains close to $P$ in
$f$-divergence while satisfying the constraints of LDP. This task captures the
fundamental challenge of producing realistic-looking data under strong privacy
guarantees. While prior work by Park et al. (NeurIPS'24) focuses on global
minimax-optimality across a class of distributions, we take a local
perspective. Specifically, we examine the minimax risk in a neighborhood around
a fixed distribution $P_0$, and characterize its exact value, which depends on
both $P_0$ and the privacy level. Our main result shows that the local minimax
risk is determined by the global minimax risk when the distribution class
$\mathcal{P}$ is restricted to a neighborhood around $P_0$. To establish this,
we (1) extend previous work from pure LDP to the more general functional LDP
framework, and (2) prove that the globally optimal functional LDP sampler
yields the optimal local sampler when constrained to distributions near $P_0$.
Building on this, we also derive a simple closed-form expression for the
locally minimax-optimal samplers which does not depend on the choice of
$f$-divergence. We further argue that this local framework naturally models
private sampling with public data, where the public data distribution is
represented by $P_0$. In this setting, we empirically compare our locally
optimal sampler to existing global methods, and demonstrate that it
consistently outperforms global minimax samplers.

Method: 基于Dherin等人的发现，将理论推广到深度多块Transformer，分析用户提示信息如何通过权重向量和矩阵在内部表示和组合，并推导出将信息压缩为token无关思想向量和思想矩阵的原则性方法。

Result: 开发了将文本输入转化为可重用权重更新的计算基础方法，为现有的向量和矩阵模型编辑技术提供了理论解释。

Conclusion: 该理论框架为基于内部状态修改的LLM控制技术提供了坚实的理论基础，使文本到权重更新的转换具有计算基础，为模型编辑技术提供了原则性指导。

Abstract: A growing body of research has demonstrated that the behavior of large
language models can be effectively controlled at inference time by directly
modifying their internal states, either through vector additions to their
activations or through updates to their weight matrices. These techniques,
while powerful, are often guided by empirical heuristics, such as deriving
steering vectors from the average activations of contrastive prompts. This work
provides a theoretical foundation for these interventions, explaining how they
emerge from the fundamental computations of the transformer architecture.
Building on the recent finding that a prompt's influence can be mathematically
mapped to implicit weight updates (Dherin et al., 2025), we generalize this
theory to deep, multi-block transformers. We show how the information contained
in any chunk of a user prompt is represented and composed internally through
weight vectors and weight matrices. We then derive a principled method for
condensing this information into token-independent thought vectors and thought
matrices. These constructs provide a theoretical explanation for existing
vector- and matrix-based model editing techniques and offer a direct,
computationally-grounded method for transmuting textual input into reusable
weight updates.

Motivation: 大型黑盒模型在处理复杂数据关系方面表现出色，但缺乏可解释性，使其在高风险场景中不可信。需要方法来解释模型预测过程。

Method: 使用SHAP分析量化特征对预测的贡献，然后对SHAP值进行聚类，将获得相同预测且预测原因相似的样本分组。

Result: 通过模拟实验和阿尔茨海默病案例研究验证了该方法，能够识别不同样本达到相同预测的各种路径。

Conclusion: SHAP值聚类提供了一种理解黑盒模型预测机制的有效方法，有助于提高模型在高风险应用中的可信度。

Abstract: In this growing age of data and technology, large black-box models are
becoming the norm due to their ability to handle vast amounts of data and learn
incredibly complex input-output relationships. The deficiency of these methods,
however, is their inability to explain the prediction process, making them
untrustworthy and their use precarious in high-stakes situations. SHapley
Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis is an explainable AI method growing in
popularity for its ability to explain model predictions in terms of the
original features. For each sample and feature in the data set, we associate a
SHAP value that quantifies the contribution of that feature to the prediction
of that sample. Clustering these SHAP values can provide insight into the data
by grouping samples that not only received the same prediction, but received
the same prediction for similar reasons. In doing so, we map the various
pathways through which distinct samples arrive at the same prediction. To
showcase this methodology, we present a simulated experiment in addition to a
case study in Alzheimer's disease using data from the Alzheimer's Disease
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) database. We also present a novel generalization
of the waterfall plot for multi-classification.

Abstract: Modern time series forecasting increasingly relies on complex ensemble models
generated by AutoML systems like AutoGluon, delivering superior accuracy but
with significant costs to transparency and interpretability. This paper
introduces a comprehensive, dual-approach framework that addresses both the
explainability and forecastability challenges in complex time series ensembles.
First, we develop a surrogate-based explanation methodology that bridges the
accuracy-interpretability gap by training a LightGBM model to faithfully mimic
AutoGluon's time series forecasts, enabling stable SHAP-based feature
attributions. We rigorously validated this approach through feature injection
experiments, demonstrating remarkably high faithfulness between extracted SHAP
values and known ground truth effects. Second, we integrated spectral
predictability analysis to quantify each series' inherent forecastability. By
comparing each time series' spectral predictability to its pure noise
benchmarks, we established an objective mechanism to gauge confidence in
forecasts and their explanations. Our empirical evaluation on the M5 dataset
found that higher spectral predictability strongly correlates not only with
improved forecast accuracy but also with higher fidelity between the surrogate
and the original forecasting model. These forecastability metrics serve as
effective filtering mechanisms and confidence scores, enabling users to
calibrate their trust in both the forecasts and their explanations. We further
demonstrated that per-item normalization is essential for generating meaningful
SHAP explanations across heterogeneous time series with varying scales. The
resulting framework delivers interpretable, instance-level explanations for
state-of-the-art ensemble forecasts, while equipping users with forecastability
metrics that serve as reliability indicators for both predictions and their
explanations.

Abstract: In-context learning allows large models to adapt to new tasks from a few
demonstrations, but it has shown limited success in molecular design. Existing
databases such as ChEMBL contain molecular properties spanning millions of
biological assays, yet labeled data for each property remain scarce. To address
this limitation, we introduce demonstration-conditioned diffusion models
(DemoDiff), which define task contexts using a small set of molecule-score
examples instead of text descriptions. These demonstrations guide a denoising
Transformer to generate molecules aligned with target properties. For scalable
pretraining, we develop a new molecular tokenizer with Node Pair Encoding that
represents molecules at the motif level, requiring 5.5$\times$ fewer nodes. We
curate a dataset containing millions of context tasks from multiple sources
covering both drugs and materials, and pretrain a 0.7-billion-parameter model
on it. Across 33 design tasks in six categories, DemoDiff matches or surpasses
language models 100-1000$\times$ larger and achieves an average rank of 3.63
compared to 5.25-10.20 for domain-specific approaches. These results position
DemoDiff as a molecular foundation model for in-context molecular design. Our

Abstract: Outlier detection in tabular data is crucial for safeguarding data integrity
in high-stakes domains such as cybersecurity, financial fraud detection, and
healthcare, where anomalies can cause serious operational and economic impacts.
Despite advances in both data mining and deep learning, many existing methods
struggle with mixed-type tabular data, often relying on encoding schemes that
lose important semantic information. Moreover, they frequently lack
interpretability, offering little insight into which specific values cause
anomalies. To overcome these challenges, we introduce \textsf{\textbf{RFOD}}, a
novel \textsf{\textbf{R}}andom \textsf{\textbf{F}}orest-based
\textsf{\textbf{O}}utlier \textsf{\textbf{D}}etection framework tailored for
tabular data. Rather than modeling a global joint distribution, \textsf{RFOD}
reframes anomaly detection as a feature-wise conditional reconstruction
problem, training dedicated random forests for each feature conditioned on the
others. This design robustly handles heterogeneous data types while preserving
the semantic integrity of categorical features. To further enable precise and
interpretable detection, \textsf{RFOD} combines Adjusted Gower's Distance (AGD)
for cell-level scoring, which adapts to skewed numerical data and accounts for
categorical confidence, with Uncertainty-Weighted Averaging (UWA) to aggregate
cell-level scores into robust row-level anomaly scores. Extensive experiments
on 15 real-world datasets demonstrate that \textsf{RFOD} consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in detection accuracy while offering
superior robustness, scalability, and interpretability for mixed-type tabular
data.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种控制优化确定性等价（OCE）风险的方法，扩展了传统的保形风险控制框架，能够处理尾部风险，并引入了端到端的保形风险训练方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习模型虽然预测准确率高，但缺乏可证明的风险或可靠性保证，这在高风险应用中至关重要。现有保形风险控制方法只能控制期望损失，无法处理对尾部风险敏感的实际应用。

Method: 开发了控制OCE风险类的方法，包括条件风险价值等尾部风险度量；引入了端到端的保形风险训练，在模型训练或微调期间通过保形OCE风险控制进行微分。

Result: 该方法在控制分类器假阴性率和电池存储操作中的金融风险等应用中，相比后处理方法显著提高了平均性能，同时保持了可证明的风险保证。

Conclusion: 提出的方法能够为深度学习模型提供可证明的风险保证，特别是针对尾部风险，并通过端到端训练改善了平均性能，适用于高风险应用场景。

Abstract: While deep learning models often achieve high predictive accuracy, their
predictions typically do not come with any provable guarantees on risk or
reliability, which are critical for deployment in high-stakes applications. The
framework of conformal risk control (CRC) provides a distribution-free,
finite-sample method for controlling the expected value of any bounded monotone
loss function and can be conveniently applied post-hoc to any pre-trained deep
learning model. However, many real-world applications are sensitive to tail
risks, as opposed to just expected loss. In this work, we develop a method for
controlling the general class of Optimized Certainty-Equivalent (OCE) risks, a
broad class of risk measures which includes as special cases the expected loss
(generalizing the original CRC method) and common tail risks like the
conditional value-at-risk (CVaR). Furthermore, standard post-hoc CRC can
degrade average-case performance due to its lack of feedback to the model. To
address this, we introduce "conformal risk training," an end-to-end approach
that differentiates through conformal OCE risk control during model training or
fine-tuning. Our method achieves provable risk guarantees while demonstrating
significantly improved average-case performance over post-hoc approaches on
applications to controlling classifiers' false negative rate and controlling
financial risk in battery storage operation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一个联邦学习框架，用于量化客户端内和客户端间的细粒度跨样本记忆化风险，发现FL模型确实会记忆客户端数据，特别是客户端内数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有FL记忆化检测技术一次只关注一个样本，低估了跨样本记忆化的更微妙风险，而集中式学习的细粒度方法无法直接应用于FL。

Method: 提出一个框架，使用细粒度跨样本记忆化测量来量化FL中的客户端内和客户端间记忆化，并研究解码策略、前缀长度和FL算法等关键因素。

Result: FL模型确实会记忆客户端数据，特别是客户端内数据多于客户端间数据，记忆化受到训练和推理因素的影响。

Conclusion: FL存在记忆化风险，需要更细粒度的检测方法，记忆化程度受多种因素影响，客户端内记忆化更为显著。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative training without raw data
sharing, but still risks training data memorization. Existing FL memorization
detection techniques focus on one sample at a time, underestimating more subtle
risks of cross-sample memorization. In contrast, recent work on centralized
learning (CL) has introduced fine-grained methods to assess memorization across
all samples in training data, but these assume centralized access to data and
cannot be applied directly to FL. We bridge this gap by proposing a framework
that quantifies both intra- and inter-client memorization in FL using
fine-grained cross-sample memorization measurement across all clients. Based on
this framework, we conduct two studies: (1) measuring subtle memorization
across clients and (2) examining key factors that influence memorization,
including decoding strategies, prefix length, and FL algorithms. Our findings
reveal that FL models do memorize client data, particularly intra-client data,
more than inter-client data, with memorization influenced by training and
inferencing factors.

*Mujin Kwun,Depen Morwani,Chloe Huangyuan Su,Stephanie Gil,Nikhil Anand,Sham Kakade*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出LOTION框架，通过随机噪声平滑量化损失函数，解决量化神经网络优化中梯度不连续的问题，保证标准优化器收敛到局部最小值。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量化神经网络优化面临根本挑战，因为量化器是分段常数函数，梯度在量化阈值处未定义，现有方法如STE缺乏收敛保证。

Method: 受Nesterov平滑启发，引入LOTION框架，使用无偏随机舍入噪声的期望来近似量化损失表面，将原始量化损失替换为平滑版本。

Result: 在标准优化器下保证收敛到损失表面的局部最小值，使用随机舍入噪声时保留原始量化损失的全局最小值。在合成测试和150M/300M参数语言模型上优于标准QAT。

Conclusion: LOTION提供了一种有理论保证的量化优化方法，有效解决了量化神经网络训练中的梯度不连续问题。

Abstract: Optimizing neural networks for quantized objectives is fundamentally
challenging because the quantizer is piece-wise constant, yielding zero
gradients everywhere except at quantization thresholds where the derivative is
undefined. Most existing methods deal with this issue by relaxing gradient
computations with techniques like Straight Through Estimators (STE) and do not
provide any guarantees of convergence. In this work, taking inspiration from
Nesterov smoothing, we approximate the quantized loss surface with a continuous
loss surface. In particular, we introduce LOTION, \textbf{L}ow-precision
\textbf{O}ptimization via s\textbf{T}ochastic-no\textbf{I}se
sm\textbf{O}othi\textbf{N}g, a principled smoothing framework that replaces the
raw quantized loss with its expectation under unbiased randomized-rounding
noise. In this framework, standard optimizers are guaranteed to converge to a
local minimum of the loss surface. Moreover, when using noise derived from
stochastic rounding, we show that the global minima of the original quantized
loss are preserved. We empirically demonstrate that this method outperforms
standard QAT on synthetic testbeds and on 150M- and 300M- parameter language
models.

TL;DR: 提出了Spatial Deconfounder方法，通过将空间干扰转化为多原因信号，同时解决空间因果推断中的未测量混杂因素和干扰问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 空间因果推断面临两个交织的挑战：未测量的空间混杂因素（如天气、空气污染）和来自附近处理的干扰。现有方法通常只解决其中一个问题而忽略另一个。

Method: 使用两阶段方法：首先通过具有空间先验的条件变分自编码器（CVAE）从局部处理向量重构替代混杂因子，然后通过灵活的结果模型估计因果效应。

Result: 在环境健康和社会科学领域的真实数据集上，Spatial Deconfounder方法持续改进了效应估计，扩展了空间混杂基准套件以包含处理干扰。

Conclusion: 通过将干扰转化为多原因信号，该框架连接了空间和去混杂文献，推进了结构化数据中的稳健因果推断。

Abstract: Causal inference in spatial domains faces two intertwined challenges: (1)
unmeasured spatial factors, such as weather, air pollution, or mobility, that
confound treatment and outcome, and (2) interference from nearby treatments
that violate standard no-interference assumptions. While existing methods
typically address one by assuming away the other, we show they are deeply
connected: interference reveals structure in the latent confounder. Leveraging
this insight, we propose the Spatial Deconfounder, a two-stage method that
reconstructs a substitute confounder from local treatment vectors using a
conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE) with a spatial prior, then estimates
causal effects via a flexible outcome model. We show that this approach enables
nonparametric identification of both direct and spillover effects under weak
assumptions--without requiring multiple treatment types or a known model of the
latent field. Empirically, we extend SpaCE, a benchmark suite for spatial
confounding, to include treatment interference, and show that the Spatial
Deconfounder consistently improves effect estimation across real-world datasets
in environmental health and social science. By turning interference into a
multi-cause signal, our framework bridges spatial and deconfounding literatures
to advance robust causal inference in structured data.

TL;DR: 结合虚拟成像工具与强化学习优化CT协议，在保证图像质量的同时显著减少计算步骤


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统CT协议优化方法需要穷举参数组合，计算成本高且不实用，需要更高效的优化方法

Method: 使用虚拟成像工具模拟人体肝脏病变模型，采用PPO强化学习算法优化管电压、管电流、重建核等参数，以最大化肝脏病变可检测性指数d'

Result: 强化学习方法在所有测试案例中均达到全局最大d'值，相比穷举搜索减少了79.7%的计算步骤

Conclusion: 虚拟成像工具与强化学习结合为CT协议管理提供了准确且计算高效的优化框架，具有广泛应用潜力

Abstract: Protocol optimization is critical in Computed Tomography (CT) to achieve high
diagnostic image quality while minimizing radiation dose. However, due to the
complex interdependencies among CT acquisition and reconstruction parameters,
traditional optimization methods rely on exhaustive testing of combinations of
these parameters, which is often impractical. This study introduces a novel
methodology that combines virtual imaging tools with reinforcement learning to
optimize CT protocols more efficiently. Human models with liver lesions were
imaged using a validated CT simulator and reconstructed with a novel CT
reconstruction toolkit. The optimization parameter space included tube voltage,
tube current, reconstruction kernel, slice thickness, and pixel size. The
optimization process was performed using a Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)
agent, which was trained to maximize an image quality objective, specifically
the detectability index (d') of liver lesions in the reconstructed images.
Optimization performance was compared against an exhaustive search performed on
a supercomputer. The proposed reinforcement learning approach achieved the
global maximum d' across test cases while requiring 79.7% fewer steps than the
exhaustive search, demonstrating both accuracy and computational efficiency.
The proposed framework is flexible and can accommodate various image quality
objectives. The findings highlight the potential of integrating virtual imaging
tools with reinforcement learning for CT protocol management.

TL;DR: 提出基于白金汉π定理的零样本迁移方法，通过无量纲缩放预训练RL策略的输入输出，无需重新训练即可适应新系统环境。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决强化学习策略在新机器人、任务或不同物理参数环境中泛化能力差的问题，提升实际应用价值。

Method: 利用白金汉π定理将策略输入（观测）和输出（动作）缩放到无量纲空间，实现预训练策略的零样本迁移。

Result: 在三个复杂度递增的环境中验证：缩放迁移在动态相似环境下性能无损失，在非相似环境下显著优于朴素迁移方法。

Conclusion: 量纲分析是增强RL策略鲁棒性和泛化能力的有效实用工具。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) policies often fail to generalize to new robots,
tasks, or environments with different physical parameters, a challenge that
limits their real-world applicability. This paper presents a simple, zero-shot
transfer method based on Buckingham's Pi Theorem to address this limitation.
The method adapts a pre-trained policy to new system contexts by scaling its
inputs (observations) and outputs (actions) through a dimensionless space,
requiring no retraining. The approach is evaluated against a naive transfer
baseline across three environments of increasing complexity: a simulated
pendulum, a physical pendulum for sim-to-real validation, and the
high-dimensional HalfCheetah. Results demonstrate that the scaled transfer
exhibits no loss of performance on dynamically similar contexts. Furthermore,
on non-similar contexts, the scaled policy consistently outperforms the naive
transfer, significantly expanding the volume of contexts where the original
policy remains effective. These findings demonstrate that dimensional analysis
provides a powerful and practical tool to enhance the robustness and
generalization of RL policies.

*Shikun Liu,Haoyu Wang,Mufei Li,Pan Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种新的结构感知文本嵌入生成范式，通过将超链接、引用等结构关系直接整合到LLM内部编码过程中，而不是依赖传统的后处理聚合方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM文本嵌入模型通常只处理原始文本，忽略了现实数据集中丰富的结构信息（如超链接、引用），这些结构信息在许多应用中提供关键上下文。

Method: 研究了两种主要的内部处理方法：顺序连接和并行缓存，并引入了上下文蒸馏和语义平衡两种技术来处理噪声结构数据。

Result: 在检索、聚类、分类和推荐任务的零样本实验中，结构感知方法始终优于纯文本和后处理基线方法。顺序连接在噪声中等长度上下文中表现更好，而并行缓存在长高信号上下文中扩展性更强但更容易受到干扰。

Conclusion: 这项工作首次全面分析了内部结构感知编码，为构建更强大和上下文感知的嵌入模型提供了蓝图。

Abstract: Text embeddings from Large Language Models (LLMs) have become foundational
for numerous applications. However, these models typically operate on raw text,
overlooking the rich structural information, such as hyperlinks or citations,
that provides crucial context in many real-world datasets. This paper
introduces and systematically evaluates a new paradigm for generating
structure-aware text embeddings by integrating these structural relations
directly into the LLM's internal encoding process, rather than relying on
traditional post-hoc aggregation. We investigate two primary in-process
methods: sequential concatenation and parallel caching. Through extensive
zero-shot experiments across retrieval, clustering, classification, and
recommendation tasks, we demonstrate that our structure-aware approaches
consistently outperform both text-only and post-hoc baselines. Our analysis
reveals critical trade-offs: sequential concatenation excels with noisy,
moderate-length contexts, while parallel caching scales more effectively to
long, high-signal contexts but is more susceptible to distractors. To address
the challenge of noisy structural data, we also introduce and validate two
effective techniques: Context Distillation and Semantic Balancing. This work
provides the first comprehensive analysis of in-process structure-aware
encoding, offering a blueprint for building more powerful and contextually
aware embedding models.

Main category: cs.LG

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RL在稀疏奖励环境中探索效率低下，而LLM具有程序性知识和推理能力，但现有方法过于刚性，需要RL策略必须遵循LLM建议或将其直接纳入奖励函数。

Method: 通过增强观察空间提供LLM生成的动作建议，让RL智能体学习何时遵循或忽略这些指导，利用LLM的世界知识和推理能力同时通过软约束保持灵活性。

Result: 在三个复杂度递增的BabyAI环境中评估，LLM指导的益处随任务难度增加而增强，在最挑战环境中相对基线提升71%最终成功率，样本效率提升高达9倍。

Conclusion: 该方法有效利用了LLM的规划能力来加速RL在挑战性环境中的训练，无需修改现有RL算法。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents often struggle in sparse-reward
environments where traditional exploration strategies fail to discover
effective action sequences. Large Language Models (LLMs) possess procedural
knowledge and reasoning capabilities from text pretraining that could guide RL
exploration, but existing approaches create rigid dependencies where RL
policies must follow LLM suggestions or incorporate them directly into reward
functions. We propose a framework that provides LLM-generated action
recommendations through augmented observation spaces, allowing RL agents to
learn when to follow or ignore this guidance. Our method leverages LLMs' world
knowledge and reasoning abilities while maintaining flexibility through soft
constraints. We evaluate our approach on three BabyAI environments of
increasing complexity and show that the benefits of LLM guidance scale with
task difficulty. In the most challenging environment, we achieve 71% relative
improvement in final success rates over baseline. The approach provides
substantial sample efficiency gains, with agents reaching performance
thresholds up to 9 times faster, and requires no modifications to existing RL
algorithms. Our results demonstrate an effective method for leveraging LLM
planning capabilities to accelerate RL training in challenging environments.

Motivation: 研究在存在观察者监督的情况下，智能体如何在不被发现的前提下最大化私有奖励的获取，这在现实世界的推荐系统、在线广告等场景中具有重要应用价值。

Result: 在KL约束下，公共次优臂的拉动最多以Θ(√T)的速率发生，提出了基于公共和私有均值的最优化问题来刻画最佳私有臂识别的最优错误指数。

Conclusion: 提出的算法能够根据公共次优臂的难度自适应地调整探索策略，数值实验验证了Θ(√T)的速率和算法的有效性。

Abstract: We consider a multi-armed bandit setting in which each arm has a public and a
private reward distribution. An observer expects an agent to follow Thompson
Sampling according to the public rewards, however, the deceptive agent aims to
quickly identify the best private arm without being noticed. The observer can
observe the public rewards and the pulled arms, but not the private rewards.
The agent, on the other hand, observes both the public and private rewards. We
formalize detectability as a stepwise Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence
constraint between the actual pull probabilities used by the agent and the
anticipated pull probabilities by the observer. We model successful pulling of
public suboptimal arms as a % Bernoulli process where the success probability
decreases with each successful pull, and show these pulls can happen at most at
a $\Theta(\sqrt{T}) $ rate under the KL constraint. We then formulate a maximin
problem based on public and private means, whose solution characterizes the
optimal error exponent for best private arm identification. We finally propose
an algorithm inspired by top-two algorithms. This algorithm naturally adapts
its exploration according to the hardness of pulling arms based on the public
suboptimality gaps. We provide numerical examples illustrating the
$\Theta(\sqrt{T}) $ rate and the behavior of the proposed algorithm.

Motivation: 开发一个能够高效学习偏微分方程解算子的物理信息深度学习框架，通过结合KANs的优势和物理约束，提高算子学习的准确性和物理一致性。

Method: 采用DeepONet风格的分支-主干架构，子网络实例化为有理KAN模块，通过PDE残差损失(PINN风格)强制物理一致性。

Result: 在ν=0.01的Burgers方程上，PO-CKAN相比PI-DeepONet将平均相对L²误差降低了约48%，在Eikonal和扩散-反应基准测试中达到竞争性精度。

Conclusion: PO-CKAN框架能够准确学习物理一致的解算子，验证了其在具有挑战性的基准问题上的有效性，为参数化时间相关PDE的快速预测提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: We propose PO-CKAN, a physics-informed deep operator framework based on
Chunkwise Rational Kolmogorov--Arnold Networks (KANs), for approximating the
solution operators of partial differential equations. This framework leverages
a Deep Operator Network (DeepONet) architecture that incorporates Chunkwise
Rational Kolmogorov--Arnold Network (CKAN) sub-networks for enhanced function
approximation. The principles of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) are
integrated into the operator learning framework to enforce physical
consistency. This design enables the efficient learning of physically
consistent spatio-temporal solution operators and allows for rapid prediction
for parametric time-dependent PDEs with varying inputs (e.g., parameters,
initial/boundary conditions) after training. Validated on challenging benchmark
problems, PO-CKAN demonstrates accurate operator learning with results closely
matching high-fidelity solutions. PO-CKAN adopts a DeepONet-style branch--trunk
architecture with its sub-networks instantiated as rational KAN modules, and
enforces physical consistency via a PDE residual (PINN-style) loss. On Burgers'
equation with $\nu=0.01$, PO-CKAN reduces the mean relative $L^2$ error by
approximately 48\% compared to PI-DeepONet, and achieves competitive accuracy
on the Eikonal and diffusion--reaction benchmarks.

Abstract: AI-powered attacks on Learning with Errors (LWE), an important hard math
problem in post-quantum cryptography, rival or outperform "classical" attacks
on LWE under certain parameter settings. Despite the promise of this approach,
a dearth of accessible data limits AI practitioners' ability to study and
improve these attacks. Creating LWE data for AI model training is time- and
compute-intensive and requires significant domain expertise. To fill this gap
and accelerate AI research on LWE attacks, we propose the TAPAS datasets, a
Toolkit for Analysis of Post-quantum cryptography using AI Systems. These
datasets cover several LWE settings and can be used off-the-shelf by AI
practitioners to prototype new approaches to cracking LWE. This work documents
TAPAS dataset creation, establishes attack performance baselines, and lays out
directions for future work.

Method: 包含三个关键组件：跨模态注意力对齐模块（动态跨模态上下文共享）、模态重要性估计器（基于置信度为每个模态分配权重）、时间反馈循环（利用先前预测保证时间一致性）。

Result: 在IEMOCAP和MOSEI的教育子集上评估，针对困惑、好奇、无聊和沮丧等情感，达到最先进性能，对缺失或噪声模态表现出强鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该框架能够捕捉情感转换并自适应优先处理可靠信号，非常适合在实时学习系统中部署。

Abstract: Understanding learner emotions in online education is critical for improving
engagement and personalized instruction. While prior work in emotion
recognition has explored multimodal fusion and temporal modeling, existing
methods often rely on static fusion strategies and assume that modality inputs
are consistently reliable, which is rarely the case in real-world learning
environments. We introduce Edu-EmotionNet, a novel framework that jointly
models temporal emotion evolution and modality reliability for robust affect
recognition. Our model incorporates three key components: a Cross-Modality
Attention Alignment (CMAA) module for dynamic cross-modal context sharing, a
Modality Importance Estimator (MIE) that assigns confidence-based weights to
each modality at every time step, and a Temporal Feedback Loop (TFL) that
leverages previous predictions to enforce temporal consistency. Evaluated on
educational subsets of IEMOCAP and MOSEI, re-annotated for confusion,
curiosity, boredom, and frustration, Edu-EmotionNet achieves state-of-the-art
performance and demonstrates strong robustness to missing or noisy modalities.
Visualizations confirm its ability to capture emotional transitions and
adaptively prioritize reliable signals, making it well suited for deployment in
real-time learning systems

Abstract: Graphs provide a universal framework for representing complex relational
systems, and inferring their structural properties is a core challenge in graph
analysis and reasoning. While large language models have recently demonstrated
emerging abilities to perform symbolic and numerical reasoning, the potential
of smaller, resource-efficient models in this context remains largely
unexplored. This paper investigates whether compact transformer-based language
models can infer graph-theoretic parameters directly from textual graph
representations. To enable systematic evaluation, we introduce the
TinyGraphEstimator dataset - a balanced collection of connected graphs
generated from multiple random graph models and annotated with detailed
structural metadata. We evaluate several small open models on their ability to
predict key graph parameters such as density, clustering, and chromatic number.
Furthermore, we apply lightweight fine-tuning using the Low-Rank Adaptation
(LoRA) technique, achieving consistent improvements across all evaluated
metrics. The results demonstrate that small language models possess non-trivial
reasoning capacity over graph-structured data and can be effectively adapted
for structural inference tasks through efficient parameter tuning.

Abstract: The imbalance (or long-tail) is the nature of many real-world data
distributions, which often induces the undesirable bias of deep classification
models toward frequent classes, resulting in poor performance for tail classes.
In this paper, we propose a novel two-stage learning approach to mitigate such
a majority-biased tendency while preserving valuable information within
datasets. Specifically, the first stage proposes a new representation learning
technique from the information theory perspective. This approach is
theoretically equivalent to minimizing intra-class distance, yielding an
effective and well-separated feature space. The second stage develops a novel
sampling strategy that selects mathematically informative instances, able to
rectify majority-biased decision boundaries without compromising a model's
overall performance. As a result, our approach achieves the state-of-the-art
performance across various long-tailed benchmark datasets, validated via

Conclusion: 强化学习框架能够有效管理边缘资源，在资源受限和干扰频繁的环境中实现可靠的3D重建。

Abstract: Real-time multi-view 3D reconstruction is a mission-critical application for
key edge-native use cases, such as fire rescue, where timely and accurate 3D
scene modeling enables situational awareness and informed decision-making.
However, the dynamic and unpredictable nature of edge resource availability
introduces disruptions, such as degraded image quality, unstable network links,
and fluctuating server loads, which challenge the reliability of the
reconstruction pipeline. In this work, we present a reinforcement learning
(RL)-based edge resource management framework for reliable 3D reconstruction to
ensure high quality reconstruction within a reasonable amount of time, despite
the system operating under a resource-constrained and disruption-prone
environment. In particular, the framework adopts two cooperative Q-learning
agents, one for camera selection and one for server selection, both of which
operate entirely online, learning policies through interactions with the edge
environment. To support learning under realistic constraints and evaluate
system performance, we implement a distributed testbed comprising lab-hosted
end devices and FABRIC infrastructure-hosted edge servers to emulate smart city
edge infrastructure under realistic disruption scenarios. Results show that the
proposed framework improves application reliability by effectively balancing
end-to-end latency and reconstruction quality in dynamic environments.

TL;DR: FairTTE是首个用于评估医学影像中时间到事件预测公平性的综合框架，揭示了不同成像模态中普遍存在的偏见问题，并发现现有公平性方法缓解效果有限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有机器学习公平性研究主要关注医学图像诊断任务，而忽视了预后场景中的时间到事件预测公平性问题，需要填补这一研究空白。

Method: 提出FairTTE框架，整合先进的时间到事件预测和公平性算法，利用因果分析技术识别和量化医学影像数据集中的偏见来源。

Result: 大规模评估显示偏见在不同成像模态中普遍存在，现有公平性方法缓解效果有限，且分布偏移下公平性维护更加困难。

Conclusion: 需要针对所有偏见形式的整体方法，以及更稳健、公平的预后模型来解决医学影像预后中的公平性问题。

Abstract: As machine learning (ML) algorithms are increasingly used in medical image
analysis, concerns have emerged about their potential biases against certain
social groups. Although many approaches have been proposed to ensure the
fairness of ML models, most existing works focus only on medical image
diagnosis tasks, such as image classification and segmentation, and overlooked
prognosis scenarios, which involve predicting the likely outcome or progression
of a medical condition over time. To address this gap, we introduce FairTTE,
the first comprehensive framework for assessing fairness in time-to-event (TTE)
prediction in medical imaging. FairTTE encompasses a diverse range of imaging
modalities and TTE outcomes, integrating cutting-edge TTE prediction and
fairness algorithms to enable systematic and fine-grained analysis of fairness
in medical image prognosis. Leveraging causal analysis techniques, FairTTE
uncovers and quantifies distinct sources of bias embedded within medical
imaging datasets. Our large-scale evaluation reveals that bias is pervasive
across different imaging modalities and that current fairness methods offer
limited mitigation. We further demonstrate a strong association between
underlying bias sources and model disparities, emphasizing the need for
holistic approaches that target all forms of bias. Notably, we find that
fairness becomes increasingly difficult to maintain under distribution shifts,
underscoring the limitations of existing solutions and the pressing need for
more robust, equitable prognostic models.

Motivation: 解决多模态数据的无监督子空间聚类问题，通过深度学习框架融合不同模态信息，提升聚类性能。

Method: 使用三阶段框架：多模态编码器融合数据到潜在空间，自表达层获取亲和矩阵，解码器重构输入数据。提出了早期、晚期和中间融合三种编码器，以及亲和融合网络。

Result: 在三个数据集上的大量实验表明，所提方法显著优于现有的多模态子空间聚类方法。

Conclusion: 提出的CNN框架在多模态子空间聚类任务中表现出色，不同融合策略都能有效提升性能。

Abstract: We present convolutional neural network (CNN) based approaches for
unsupervised multimodal subspace clustering. The proposed framework consists of
three main stages - multimodal encoder, self-expressive layer, and multimodal
decoder. The encoder takes multimodal data as input and fuses them to a latent
space representation. The self-expressive layer is responsible for enforcing
the self-expressiveness property and acquiring an affinity matrix corresponding
to the data points. The decoder reconstructs the original input data. The
network uses the distance between the decoder's reconstruction and the original
input in its training. We investigate early, late and intermediate fusion
techniques and propose three different encoders corresponding to them for
spatial fusion. The self-expressive layers and multimodal decoders are
essentially the same for different spatial fusion-based approaches. In addition
to various spatial fusion-based methods, an affinity fusion-based network is
also proposed in which the self-expressive layer corresponding to different
modalities is enforced to be the same. Extensive experiments on three datasets
show that the proposed methods significantly outperform the state-of-the-art
multimodal subspace clustering methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文分析了自监督对比学习(CL)和仅负样本监督对比学习(NSCL)在表示层面的对齐性，证明它们在表示相似性矩阵上保持接近，但参数空间会出现指数级发散。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然已有理论表明CL损失近似于NSCL损失，但缺乏对表示层面是否对齐的研究。本文旨在验证CL和NSCL在表示层面的对齐性，而不仅仅是目标函数层面的相似性。

Method: 在共享随机性条件下训练CL和NSCL模型，分析它们的表示相似性矩阵，并推导出关于CKA和RSA等对齐度量的高概率保证边界。

Result: 证明CL和NSCL的表示相似性矩阵在现实条件下保持接近，对齐度随类别数、温度增加而改善，但参数空间会出现指数级发散。实证验证了这些预测。

Conclusion: NSCL可作为自监督与监督学习之间的原则性桥梁，CL-NSCL对齐性随规模和温度增强，NSCL比其它监督目标更接近CL。

Abstract: Self-supervised contrastive learning (CL) has achieved remarkable empirical
success, often producing representations that rival supervised pre-training on
downstream tasks. Recent theory explains this by showing that the CL loss
closely approximates a supervised surrogate, Negatives-Only Supervised
Contrastive Learning (NSCL) loss, as the number of classes grows. Yet this
loss-level similarity leaves an open question: {\em Do CL and NSCL also remain
aligned at the representation level throughout training, not just in their
objectives?}
  We address this by analyzing the representation alignment of CL and NSCL
models trained under shared randomness (same initialization, batches, and
augmentations). First, we show that their induced representations remain
similar: specifically, we prove that the similarity matrices of CL and NSCL
stay close under realistic conditions. Our bounds provide high-probability
guarantees on alignment metrics such as centered kernel alignment (CKA) and
representational similarity analysis (RSA), and they clarify how alignment
improves with more classes, higher temperatures, and its dependence on batch
size. In contrast, we demonstrate that parameter-space coupling is inherently
unstable: divergence between CL and NSCL weights can grow exponentially with
training time.
  Finally, we validate these predictions empirically, showing that CL-NSCL
alignment strengthens with scale and temperature, and that NSCL tracks CL more
closely than other supervised objectives. This positions NSCL as a principled
bridge between self-supervised and supervised learning. Our code and project

TL;DR: 提出自适应时间掩码(ATM)方法解决稀疏自编码器训练中的特征吸收问题，通过动态调整特征选择来学习更稳定、可解释的特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有稀疏自编码器训练方法存在特征吸收问题，即特征相互吸收以最小化L1惩罚，导致难以一致识别和分析模型行为。

Method: ATM通过跟踪激活幅度、频率和重构贡献来计算随时间演化的重要性分数，基于统计阈值应用概率掩码机制进行特征选择。

Result: 在Gemma-2-2b模型上的实验表明，ATM相比TopK和JumpReLU SAEs方法显著降低了吸收分数，同时保持了优秀的重构质量。

Conclusion: ATM为学习稳定、可解释的神经网络特征提供了原则性解决方案，为更可靠的模型分析奠定了基础。

Abstract: Understanding the internal representations of large language models is
crucial for ensuring their reliability and safety, with sparse autoencoders
(SAEs) emerging as a promising interpretability approach. However, current SAE
training methods face feature absorption, where features (or neurons) are
absorbed into each other to minimize $L_1$ penalty, making it difficult to
consistently identify and analyze model behaviors. We introduce Adaptive
Temporal Masking (ATM), a novel training approach that dynamically adjusts
feature selection by tracking activation magnitudes, frequencies, and
reconstruction contributions to compute importance scores that evolve over
time. ATM applies a probabilistic masking mechanism based on statistical
thresholding of these importance scores, creating a more natural feature
selection process. Through extensive experiments on the Gemma-2-2b model, we
demonstrate that ATM achieves substantially lower absorption scores compared to
existing methods like TopK and JumpReLU SAEs, while maintaining excellent
reconstruction quality. These results establish ATM as a principled solution
for learning stable, interpretable features in neural networks, providing a
foundation for more reliable model analysis.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种稀疏分解方法，识别了人类高级视觉皮层三个通路（腹侧、背侧、外侧）的主要表征成分，并开发了稀疏成分对齐（SCA）方法来测量大脑与机器视觉系统的表征对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索为什么在单个任务上训练的深度神经网络能够很好地模拟整个视觉系统，尽管人类视觉皮层不同通路具有不同的功能过程。

Method: 使用稀疏分解方法识别三个视觉通路的主要表征成分，并开发SCA方法来测量大脑与机器视觉系统的表征对齐。

Result: 发现三个视觉通路的成分响应特征存在明显差异：腹侧通路对脸、地点、身体、文字和食物敏感；外侧通路对社会互动、隐含运动和手部动作敏感；背侧通路成分较难解释。SCA显示标准视觉DNN与腹侧通路的对齐度高于背侧或外侧通路。

Conclusion: SCA方法比传统群体水平几何方法能更精细地揭示大脑与机器视觉系统的表征对齐差异，提供对系统潜在神经调谐轴更敏感的测量方法。

Abstract: The ventral, dorsal, and lateral streams in high-level human visual cortex
are implicated in distinct functional processes. Yet, deep neural networks
(DNNs) trained on a single task model the entire visual system surprisingly
well, hinting at common computational principles across these pathways. To
explore this inconsistency, we applied a novel sparse decomposition approach to
identify the dominant components of visual representations within each stream.
Consistent with traditional neuroscience research, we find a clear difference
in component response profiles across the three visual streams -- identifying
components selective for faces, places, bodies, text, and food in the ventral
stream; social interactions, implied motion, and hand actions in the lateral
stream; and some less interpretable components in the dorsal stream. Building
on this, we introduce Sparse Component Alignment (SCA), a new method for
measuring representational alignment between brains and machines that better
captures the latent neural tuning of these two visual systems. Using SCA, we
find that standard visual DNNs are more aligned with the ventral than either
dorsal or lateral representations. SCA reveals these distinctions with greater
resolution than conventional population-level geometry, offering a measure of
representational alignment that is sensitive to a system's underlying axes of
neural tuning.

Conclusion: BPMI在固定计算预算下实现了更高的预测精度，证明了其在多保真度高斯过程分类中的有效性。

Abstract: Many science and engineering problems rely on expensive computational
simulations, where a multi-fidelity approach can accelerate the exploration of
a parameter space. We study efficient allocation of a simulation budget using a
Gaussian Process (GP) model in the binary simulation output case. This paper
introduces Bernoulli Parameter Mutual Information (BPMI), a batch active
learning algorithm for multi-fidelity GP classifiers. BPMI circumvents the
intractability of calculating mutual information in the probability space by
employing a first-order Taylor expansion of the link function. We evaluate BPMI
against several baselines on two synthetic test cases and a complex, real-world
application involving the simulation of a laser-ignited rocket combustor. In
all experiments, BPMI demonstrates superior performance, achieving higher
predictive accuracy for a fixed computational budget.

TL;DR: 提出了Dig-DEC，一种基于信息增益的模型自由决策估计系数，用于解决结构化观测决策问题。该方法在对抗性环境中无需显式奖励估计器，并在混合MDP中实现了首个模型自由的遗憾界限。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于乐观决策估计系数的方法只能处理随机环境，无法扩展到对抗性环境。需要一种新的方法来填补这一空白，特别是在混合MDP中实现模型自由的遗憾界限。

Method: 引入Dig-DEC，通过纯信息增益驱动探索，而非乐观主义。改进了在线函数估计过程，包括平均估计误差最小化和贝尔曼完备MDP中的平方误差最小化。

Result: Dig-DEC始终不大于乐观DEC，在特殊情况下可以更小。在混合MDP中获得了首个模型自由的遗憾界限。改进了估计器，将遗憾界限从T^{3/4}提升到T^{2/3}(在线)和从T^{5/6}提升到T^{7/9}(离线)。在贝尔曼完备MDP中，遗憾界限从T^{2/3}提升到√T。

Conclusion: Dig-DEC成功解决了对抗性环境中的决策问题，填补了现有方法的空白，并在多个场景中实现了显著的性能提升，首次使DEC基方法在贝尔曼完备MDP中达到与乐观基方法相当的性能。

Abstract: We study decision making with structured observation (DMSO). Previous work
(Foster et al., 2021b, 2023a) has characterized the complexity of DMSO via the
decision-estimation coefficient (DEC), but left a gap between the regret upper
and lower bounds that scales with the size of the model class. To tighten this
gap, Foster et al. (2023b) introduced optimistic DEC, achieving a bound that
scales only with the size of the value-function class. However, their
optimism-based exploration is only known to handle the stochastic setting, and
it remains unclear whether it extends to the adversarial setting.
  We introduce Dig-DEC, a model-free DEC that removes optimism and drives
exploration purely by information gain. Dig-DEC is always no larger than
optimistic DEC and can be much smaller in special cases. Importantly, the
removal of optimism allows it to handle adversarial environments without
explicit reward estimators. By applying Dig-DEC to hybrid MDPs with stochastic
transitions and adversarial rewards, we obtain the first model-free regret
bounds for hybrid MDPs with bandit feedback under several general transition
structures, resolving the main open problem left by Liu et al. (2025).
  We also improve the online function-estimation procedure in model-free
learning: For average estimation error minimization, we refine the estimator in
Foster et al. (2023b) to achieve sharper concentration, improving their regret
bounds from $T^{3/4}$ to $T^{2/3}$ (on-policy) and from $T^{5/6}$ to $T^{7/9}$
(off-policy). For squared error minimization in Bellman-complete MDPs, we
redesign their two-timescale procedure, improving the regret bound from
$T^{2/3}$ to $\sqrt{T}$. This is the first time a DEC-based method achieves
performance matching that of optimism-based approaches (Jin et al., 2021; Xie
et al., 2023) in Bellman-complete MDPs.

Conclusion: ACPO通过平衡探索与利用，有效解决了强化学习在复杂推理任务中的关键问题，为可验证奖励的强化学习提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: While Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) enhances complex
reasoning in LLMs, current methods struggle to balance exploration and
exploitation. This leads to critical issues like inaccurate credit assignment
for intermediate steps and premature entropy collapse, limiting model
performance. To address this, we introduce Attribution-based Contribution to
Policy Optimization (ACPO), a phased framework that incorporates a
difficulty-aware curriculum. ACPO improves exploration by using trajectory
semantic segmentation and an attribution-based representation to dynamically
regulate policy entropy, thus mitigating its collapse. Concurrently, it
enhances exploitation with a factorized reward system that precisely quantifies
the hierarchical contribution of each reasoning step, ensuring accurate credit
assignment. Extensive experiments on challenging benchmarks, including AIME,
MATH, and AMC, demonstrate that ACPO significantly outperforms existing
state-of-the-art approaches.

Motivation: 现有的多臂老虎机分析主要从时域和累积遗憾角度进行，难以刻画学习过程的动态特性，需要新的分析框架来理解算法的动态行为。

Method: 构建频域老虎机模型，将每个臂的奖励估计视为频谱分量，不确定性对应分量频率，将老虎机算法解释为自适应滤波器。

Result: 证明了UCB算法置信区间项在频域中等效于对不确定频谱分量的时变增益，该增益与访问次数的平方根成反比，并推导了关于探索率衰减的有限时间动态界。

Conclusion: 该理论不仅为经典算法提供了新颖直观的物理解释，还为设计具有自适应参数调整的下一代算法奠定了严格的理论基础。

Abstract: The stochastic multi-armed bandit (MAB) problem is one of the most
fundamental models in sequential decision-making, with the core challenge being
the trade-off between exploration and exploitation. Although algorithms such as
Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) and Thompson Sampling, along with their regret
theories, are well-established, existing analyses primarily operate from a
time-domain and cumulative regret perspective, struggling to characterize the
dynamic nature of the learning process. This paper proposes a novel
frequency-domain analysis framework, reformulating the bandit process as a
signal processing problem. Within this framework, the reward estimate of each
arm is viewed as a spectral component, with its uncertainty corresponding to
the component's frequency, and the bandit algorithm is interpreted as an
adaptive filter. We construct a formal Frequency-Domain Bandit Model and prove
the main theorem: the confidence bound term in the UCB algorithm is equivalent
in the frequency domain to a time-varying gain applied to uncertain spectral
components, a gain inversely proportional to the square root of the visit
count. Based on this, we further derive finite-time dynamic bounds concerning
the exploration rate decay. This theory not only provides a novel and intuitive
physical interpretation for classical algorithms but also lays a rigorous
theoretical foundation for designing next-generation algorithms with adaptive
parameter adjustment.

Result: 实验结果表明，LLM在积累少量样本后能显著降低AoI且无需模型训练，而DDPG方法在训练后获得更稳定的性能。

Conclusion: LLM和DDPG相结合的双路径优化方法能有效改善车联网中的AoI性能，LLM提供快速优化能力，DDPG提供稳定性能保障。

Abstract: Addressing the problem of Age of Information (AoI) deterioration caused by
packet collisions and vehicle speed-related channel uncertainties in
Semi-Persistent Scheduling (SPS) for the Internet of Vehicles (IoV), this
letter proposes an optimization approach based on Large Language Models (LLM)
and Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG). First, an AoI calculation model
influenced by vehicle speed, vehicle density, and Resource Reservation Interval
(RRI) is established, followed by the design of a dual-path optimization
scheme. The DDPG is guided by the state space and reward function, while the
LLM leverages contextual learning to generate optimal parameter configurations.
Experimental results demonstrate that LLM can significantly reduce AoI after
accumulating a small number of exemplars without requiring model training,
whereas the DDPG method achieves more stable performance after training.

Conclusion: 该方法为小地球数据的时空预测提供了一种简单且鲁棒的解决方案，能够有效处理跨场景预测问题。

Abstract: Small Earth data are geoscience observations with limited short-term
monitoring variability, providing sparse but meaningful measurements, typically
exhibiting spatiotemporal correlations. Spatiotemporal forecasting on such data
is crucial for understanding geoscientific processes despite their small scale.
However, conventional deep learning models for spatiotemporal forecasting
requires task-specific training for different scenarios. Foundation models do
not need task-specific training, but they often exhibit forecasting bias toward
the global mean of the pretraining distribution. Here we propose a simple and
robust approach for spatiotemporally correlated small Earth data forecasting.
The essential idea is to characterize and quantify spatiotemporal patterns of
small Earth data and then utilize tabular foundation models for accurate
forecasting across different scenarios. Comparative results across three
typical scenarios demonstrate that our forecasting approach achieves superior
accuracy compared to the graph deep learning model (T-GCN) and tabular
foundation model (TabPFN) in the majority of instances, exhibiting stronger
robustness.

Abstract: We introduce adaptive-basis physics-informed neural networks (AB-PINNs), a
novel approach to domain decomposition for training PINNs in which existing
subdomains dynamically adapt to the intrinsic features of the unknown solution.
Drawing inspiration from classical mesh refinement techniques, we also modify
the domain decomposition on-the-fly throughout training by introducing new
subdomains in regions of high residual loss, thereby providing additional
expressive power where the solution of the differential equation is challenging
to represent. Our flexible approach to domain decomposition is well-suited for
multiscale problems, as different subdomains can learn to capture different
scales of the underlying solution. Moreover, the ability to introduce new
subdomains during training helps prevent convergence to unwanted local minima
and can reduce the need for extensive hyperparameter tuning compared to static
domain decomposition approaches. Throughout, we present comprehensive numerical
results which demonstrate the effectiveness of AB-PINNs at solving a variety of
complex multiscale partial differential equations.

optimal uncertainty modeling. Specifically, MPC employs a bi-level optimization
approach: in the inner loop, model parameters are updated through a dynamically
configured loss function that adapts to the current training state; in the
outer loop, a policy network optimizes the KL divergence coefficient and
class-specific Dirichlet prior strengths based on multi-objective rewards
balancing prediction accuracy and uncertainty quality. Unlike previous methods
with fixed priors, our learnable Dirichlet prior enables flexible adaptation to
class distributions and training dynamics. Extensive experimental results show
that MPC significantly enhances the reliability and calibration of model
predictions across various tasks, improving uncertainty calibration, prediction
accuracy, and performance retention after confidence-based sample rejection.

*Haroon Gharwi,Kai Shu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出VARNN模型，一种残差感知的神经网络架构，通过显式学习近期预测残差的误差记忆来重新校准后续预测，提升时间序列回归在非平稳、异方差环境下的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界时间序列数据存在非平稳行为、机制转换和时变噪声（异方差），这些会降低标准回归模型的鲁棒性。

Method: VARNN在传统前馈预测器基础上增加了学习的误差记忆状态，该状态从短期上下文步骤的残差中更新，作为变异性和漂移的信号，然后调节当前时间步的最终预测。

Result: 在多个领域数据集（家电能耗、医疗保健、环境监测）上的实验结果表明，VARNN相比静态、动态和循环基线模型实现了更优性能，以最小计算开销获得更低的测试MSE。

Conclusion: VARNN模型在漂移和波动环境下提供鲁棒预测，显示出其作为时间序列学习有前景框架的潜力。

Abstract: Real-world time series data exhibit non-stationary behavior, regime shifts,
and temporally varying noise (heteroscedastic) that degrade the robustness of
standard regression models. We introduce the Variability-Aware Recursive Neural
Network (VARNN), a novel residual-aware architecture for supervised time-series
regression that learns an explicit error memory from recent prediction
residuals and uses it to recalibrate subsequent predictions. VARNN augments a
feed-forward predictor with a learned error-memory state that is updated from
residuals over a short context steps as a signal of variability and drift, and
then conditions the final prediction at the current time step. Across diverse
dataset domains, appliance energy, healthcare, and environmental monitoring,
experimental results demonstrate VARNN achieves superior performance and
attains lower test MSE with minimal computational overhead over static,
dynamic, and recurrent baselines. Our findings show that the VARNN model offers
robust predictions under a drift and volatility environment, highlighting its
potential as a promising framework for time-series learning.

TL;DR: LAGA是一个统一的多智能体框架，通过数据中心的视角解决文本属性图的质量问题，在稀疏、噪声和不平衡等九种场景下显著提升图质量和任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统图神经网络和LLM增强的GNN在文本属性图上对输入质量高度敏感，现有方法主要关注模型架构改进而忽视图数据本身的系统性优化，导致实际效果有限。

Method: 提出LAGA多智能体框架，包含检测、规划、行动和评估四个协作智能体，形成自动化闭环。核心行动智能体采用双编码器和三目标设计，捕获跨模态互补信息并进行整体图质量增强。

Result: 在九种场景下的实验表明，LAGA显著提升了图质量，并在各种任务和骨干网络上实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 数据中心的图质量优化是实现可靠文本属性图和鲁棒图学习的关键。

Abstract: Text-attributed graphs (TAGs) have emerged as a powerful representation that
combines structural connections with fine-grained semantics, supporting a wide
range of data-centric applications. However, the performance of graph neural
networks (GNNs) on TAGs is highly sensitive to input quality. Our empirical
study shows that both traditional GNNs and LLM-enhanced GNNs suffer significant
degradation across nine representative scenarios of sparsity, noise, and
imbalance, highlighting graph quality as a critical bottleneck. Existing
approaches mainly focus on improving model architectures, while neglecting
systematic optimization of TAG data itself, leading to limited effectiveness in
practice. To address this gap, we propose LAGA (Large Language and Graph
Agent), a unified multi-agent framework that treats graph quality control as a
first-class, data-centric problem. LAGA integrates four collaborative
agents-detection, planning, action, and evaluation-into an automated closed
loop. At its core, the action agent employs a dual-encoder and tri-objective
design to capture complementary information across modalities and perform
holistic graph quality enhancement. Experiments across nine scenarios show that
LAGA improves graph quality and achieves state-of-the-art performance across
various tasks and backbones, validating data-centric quality optimization as
key to reliable TAGs and robust graph learning.

Abstract: Learning with high-resource data has demonstrated substantial success in
artificial intelligence (AI); however, the costs associated with data
annotation and model training remain significant. A fundamental objective of AI
research is to achieve robust generalization with limited-resource data. This
survey employs agnostic active sampling theory within the Probably
Approximately Correct (PAC) framework to analyze the generalization error and
label complexity associated with learning from low-resource data in both
model-agnostic supervised and unsupervised settings. Based on this analysis, we
investigate a suite of optimization strategies tailored for low-resource data
learning, including gradient-informed optimization, meta-iteration
optimization, geometry-aware optimization, and LLMs-powered optimization.
Furthermore, we provide a comprehensive overview of multiple learning paradigms
that can benefit from low-resource data, including domain transfer,
reinforcement feedback, and hierarchical structure modeling. Finally, we
conclude our analysis and investigation by summarizing the key findings and
highlighting their implications for learning with low-resource data.

Motivation: 传统基于VAE的贝叶斯优化方法在构建潜在空间时，仅使用重建损失会导致功能分布不匹配问题，从而影响优化性能。

Method: 提出HiBBO框架，将HiPPO（一种长序列建模方法）引入VAE的潜在空间构建过程，通过空间一致性来减少分布不匹配。

Conclusion: 该工作弥合了高维序列表示学习与高效贝叶斯优化之间的差距，为神经架构搜索、材料科学等领域提供了更广泛的应用可能。

Abstract: Bayesian Optimisation (BO) is a powerful tool for optimising expensive
blackbox functions but its effectiveness diminishes in highdimensional spaces
due to sparse data and poor surrogate model scalability While Variational
Autoencoder (VAE) based approaches address this by learning low-dimensional
latent representations the reconstructionbased objective function often brings
the functional distribution mismatch between the latent space and original
space leading to suboptimal optimisation performance In this paper we first
analyse the reason why reconstructiononly loss may lead to distribution
mismatch and then propose HiBBO a novel BO framework that introduces the space
consistency into the latent space construction in VAE using HiPPO - a method
for longterm sequence modelling - to reduce the functional distribution
mismatch between the latent space and original space Experiments on
highdimensional benchmark tasks demonstrate that HiBBO outperforms existing
VAEBO methods in convergence speed and solution quality Our work bridges the
gap between high-dimensional sequence representation learning and efficient
Bayesian Optimisation enabling broader applications in neural architecture
search materials science and beyond.

TL;DR: 学习优化器(LOs)能够学习并内化传统正则化技术的效果，无需在目标函数中显式应用这些正则化器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索正则化器是否可以被学习，挑战传统显式优化器损失正则化的必要性。

Method: 通过标准基准测试(MNIST、FMNIST、CIFAR和神经网络)进行广泛实验，比较有和没有显式正则化器训练的LOs。

Result: 正则化LOs在测试准确率和泛化能力方面持续优于未正则化版本，且能够将正则化效果保留并迁移到新优化任务中。

Conclusion: LOs能够固有地学习正则化属性，挑战了传统显式优化器损失正则化的必要性。

Abstract: Learned Optimizers (LOs), a type of Meta-learning, have gained traction due
to their ability to be parameterized and trained for efficient optimization.
Traditional gradient-based methods incorporate explicit regularization
techniques such as Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM), Gradient-norm Aware
Minimization (GAM), and Gap-guided Sharpness-Aware Minimization (GSAM) to
enhance generalization and convergence. In this work, we explore a fundamental
question: \textbf{Can regularizers be learned?} We empirically demonstrate that
LOs can be trained to learn and internalize the effects of traditional
regularization techniques without explicitly applying them to the objective
function. We validate this through extensive experiments on standard benchmarks
(including MNIST, FMNIST, CIFAR and Neural Networks such as MLP, MLP-Relu and
CNN), comparing LOs trained with and without access to explicit regularizers.
Regularized LOs consistently outperform their unregularized counterparts in
terms of test accuracy and generalization. Furthermore, we show that LOs retain
and transfer these regularization effects to new optimization tasks by
inherently seeking minima similar to those targeted by these regularizers. Our
results suggest that LOs can inherently learn regularization properties,
\textit{challenging the conventional necessity of explicit optimizee loss
regularization.

TL;DR: 本文提出了RLER方法，通过集成多个模型和自适应奖励插值与轨迹选择，解决了RLIR中的系统偏差问题，在无标签样本上实现了稳定扩展。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RLVR受限于标注样本数量，而RLIR在无标签环境下性能不稳定，存在模型对高置信度轨迹过度估计的系统偏差问题。

Method: 提出RLER方法，通过集成多个模型、自适应奖励插值和轨迹选择来缓解系统偏差，使用三个指标量化偏差。

Result: RLER相比RLIR提升13.6%，仅比RLVR低3.6%，在无标签样本上实现了稳定扩展。

Conclusion: RLER有效解决了RLIR中的系统偏差问题，在无标签环境下实现了接近RLVR的性能，具有很高的应用价值。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) scales the reasoning
ability of large language models (LLMs) but remains bottlenecked by limited
labeled samples for continued data scaling. Reinforcement learning with
intrinsic rewards (RLIR), where the policy model assigns rewards to its own
rollouts, enables sustainable scaling in unlabeled settings, yet its
performance and stability lag behind RLVR. We trace this gap to a system bias:
the model tends to overestimate its high-confidence rollouts, leading to biased
and unstable reward estimation. This bias accumulates as training progresses,
with deviations from the oracle drifting toward over-reward, causing unstable
training. We characterize this bias using three metrics: $\rho_{\text{noise}}$,
$\rho_{\text{selfbias}}$, and $\rho_{\text{symbias}}$. We find that
$\rho_{\text{noise}}$ and $\rho_{\text{symbias}}$ impact convergence, while
$\rho_{\text{selfbias}}$ amplifies both correct and incorrect updates, leading
to instability. To mitigate this, we propose reinforcement learning with
ensembled rewards (RLER), which aggregates diverse models and adapts reward
interpolation and rollout selection. Extensive experiments show that RLER
improves by +13.6% over RLIR and is only 3.6% below RLVR, achieving stable
scaling on unlabeled samples, making it highly applicable.

TL;DR: 提出FedL2T框架，通过双教师知识蒸馏解决癫痫预测中联邦学习在异构客户端下的性能问题，实现个性化模型训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 癫痫预测需要大量EEG数据，但标注成本高且涉及隐私问题。联邦学习虽能保护隐私，但在真实场景中由于患者间差异，现有方法在异构客户端设置下性能不佳。

Method: 使用双教师知识蒸馏策略，每个客户端同时从全局聚合模型和动态分配的同伴模型学习；采用自适应多级蒸馏对齐预测输出和中间特征表示；引入近端正则化项增强训练稳定性。

Result: 在两个EEG数据集上的实验表明，FedL2T始终优于最先进的联邦学习方法，特别是在低标签条件下；收敛快速稳定，减少了通信轮次和开销。

Conclusion: FedL2T为隐私敏感的医疗场景中的癫痫预测提供了一个可靠且个性化的解决方案。

Abstract: The training of deep learning models in seizure prediction requires large
amounts of Electroencephalogram (EEG) data. However, acquiring sufficient
labeled EEG data is difficult due to annotation costs and privacy constraints.
Federated Learning (FL) enables privacy-preserving collaborative training by
sharing model updates instead of raw data. However, due to the inherent
inter-patient variability in real-world scenarios, existing FL-based seizure
prediction methods struggle to achieve robust performance under heterogeneous
client settings. To address this challenge, we propose FedL2T, a personalized
federated learning framework that leverages a novel two-teacher knowledge
distillation strategy to generate superior personalized models for each client.
Specifically, each client simultaneously learns from a globally aggregated
model and a dynamically assigned peer model, promoting more direct and enriched
knowledge exchange. To ensure reliable knowledge transfer, FedL2T employs an
adaptive multi-level distillation strategy that aligns both prediction outputs
and intermediate feature representations based on task confidence. In addition,
a proximal regularization term is introduced to constrain personalized model
updates, thereby enhancing training stability. Extensive experiments on two EEG
datasets demonstrate that FedL2T consistently outperforms state-of-the-art FL
methods, particularly under low-label conditions. Moreover, FedL2T exhibits
rapid and stable convergence toward optimal performance, thereby reducing the
number of communication rounds and associated overhead. These results
underscore the potential of FedL2T as a reliable and personalized solution for
seizure prediction in privacy-sensitive healthcare scenarios.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了Constraints-of-Thought (Const-o-T)框架，通过(intent, constraint)对来指导蒙特卡洛树搜索，解决LLMs在复杂多步规划中难以满足符号约束和用户意图的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有推理方法如CoT、ToT等虽然扩展了搜索空间，但经常产生不可行动作或幻觉步骤，无法确保计划符合高层用户意图和符号约束。

Method: 使用(intent, constraint)对作为结构化先验，压缩搜索空间并强制有效性，将Const-o-T集成到MCTS中，通过约束修剪不可行分支并引导探索语义有效动作。

Result: 在Risk游戏、CAD代码生成和算术推理三个领域验证，该方法优于基线，获得更高准确性和更强的结构对齐。

Conclusion: Const-o-T为约束引导推理提供了可泛化的基础，使LLMs能够进行更高效、约束对齐和领域自适应的规划。

Abstract: While researchers have made significant progress in enabling large language
models (LLMs) to perform multi-step planning, LLMs struggle to ensure that
those plans align with high-level user intent and satisfy symbolic constraints,
especially in complex, multi-step domains. Existing reasoning approaches such
as Chain-of-Thought (CoT), Tree-of-Thought (ToT), and verifier-augmented
methods, expand the search space but often yield infeasible actions or
hallucinated steps. To overcome these limitations, we propose
Constraints-of-Thought (Const-o-T), a framework that provides a structured
prior that enables Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) focus search on semantically
meaningful paths. Each reasoning step is represented as an (intent, constraint)
pair, which serves both to compress the search space and enforce validity.
Unlike prior methods that merely generate reasoning traces or validate outputs
post hoc, Const-o-T uses (intent, constraint)pairs to actively focus the search
toward feasible and meaningful plans. We integrate Const-o-T into MCTS using a
structured representation of intent-constraint pairs constraints prune
infeasible branches and guide exploration toward semantically valid actions,
improving planning efficiency and verifiable decision-making. We demonstrate
across three domains Risk game, CAD code generation, and arithmetic reasoning
that our approach outperforms baselines, yielding higher accuracy and stronger
structural alignment. Our contribution is to demonstrate that Const-of-T offers
a generalizable foundation for constraint-guided reasoning, enabling more
efficient, constraint-aligned, and domain-adaptable planning with LLMs.

Motivation: 现有的硬件感知神经架构搜索方法由于高时间成本、大量手动分析和在具有复杂设备特定能量行为的多样化硬件平台上扩展性差，在现实世界部署中仍不实用。

Conclusion: PlatformX提供了一个实用的硬件感知神经架构搜索解决方案，克服了现有方法的局限性，为边缘设备设计高效深度神经网络提供了自动化框架。

Abstract: Hardware-Aware Neural Architecture Search (HW-NAS) has emerged as a powerful
tool for designing efficient deep neural networks (DNNs) tailored to edge
devices. However, existing methods remain largely impractical for real-world
deployment due to their high time cost, extensive manual profiling, and poor
scalability across diverse hardware platforms with complex, device-specific
energy behavior. In this paper, we present PlatformX, a fully automated and
transferable HW-NAS framework designed to overcome these limitations. PlatformX
integrates four key components: (i) an energy-driven search space that expands
conventional NAS design by incorporating energy-critical configurations,
enabling exploration of high-efficiency architectures; (ii) a transferable
kernel-level energy predictor across devices and incrementally refined with
minimal on-device samples; (iii) a Pareto-based multi-objective search
algorithm that balances energy and accuracy to identify optimal trade-offs; and
(iv) a high-resolution runtime energy profiling system that automates on-device
power measurement using external monitors without human intervention. We
evaluate PlatformX across multiple mobile platforms, showing that it
significantly reduces search overhead while preserving accuracy and energy
fidelity. It identifies models with up to 0.94 accuracy or as little as 0.16 mJ
per inference, both outperforming MobileNet-V2 in accuracy and efficiency. Code

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常单独采用权重剪枝或低比特量化，导致压缩率不理想。需要一种统一框架来同时进行剪枝和量化，以获得更高的压缩率。

Method: 使用spike-and-slab先验诱导稀疏性，并通过高斯混合模型(GMM)建模量化权重以实现低比特精度。采用贝叶斯变分学习方法统一处理剪枝和量化。

Result: 在ResNet、BERT-base、Llama3和Qwen2.5模型上的实验表明，该方法比现有方法实现了更高的压缩率，同时保持了可比的性能下降。

Conclusion: 提出的SQS框架通过同时进行剪枝和量化，在保持模型性能的同时实现了更高的压缩率，为资源受限设备上的模型部署提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Compressing large-scale neural networks is essential for deploying models on
resource-constrained devices. Most existing methods adopt weight pruning or
low-bit quantization individually, often resulting in suboptimal compression
rates to preserve acceptable performance drops. We introduce a unified
framework for simultaneous pruning and low-bit quantization via Bayesian
variational learning (SQS), which achieves higher compression rates than prior
baselines while maintaining comparable performance. The key idea is to employ a
spike-and-slab prior to inducing sparsity and model quantized weights using
Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) to enable low-bit precision. In theory, we
provide the consistent result of our proposed variational approach to a sparse
and quantized deep neural network. Extensive experiments on compressing ResNet,
BERT-base, Llama3, and Qwen2.5 models show that our method achieves higher
compression rates than a line of existing methods with comparable performance
drops.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM遗忘方法假设能获取干净、定义明确的遗忘数据，但现实中的遗忘数据往往是低质量、合成改写或带水印的，这引发了遗忘可靠性的担忧。

Method: 系统性地在噪声遗忘集上对最先进的LLM遗忘方法（RMU和NPO）进行基准测试，并提出基于显著性的解释框架。

Result: 研究发现遗忘对扰动具有惊人的稳健性，关键语义成分在表面形式大幅变化的情况下仍保持一致的遗忘驱动作用。

Conclusion: 遗忘算法主要受深层语义线索而非浅层词汇模式引导，这解释了其在噪声遗忘数据下的稳健表现。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable generative capabilities but
raise ethical and security concerns by memorizing sensitive data, reinforcing
biases, and producing harmful content. These risks have spurred interest in LLM
unlearning, the task of removing knowledge associated with undesirable data
from pre-trained models. However, most existing methods assume access to clean,
well-defined forget data samples, whereas real-world forget data could often be
low-quality, synthetically rewritten, or watermarked, casting doubt on the
reliability of unlearning. This work presents the first study of unlearning
under perturbed or low-fidelity forget data, referred to as noisy forget sets.
By systematically benchmarking state-of-the-art LLM unlearning methods, RMU and
NPO, on such noisy forget sets, we find that unlearning remains surprisingly
robust to perturbations, provided that core semantic signals are preserved. To
explain this robustness, we propose a saliency-based interpretation: key
semantic components that drive forgetting remain consistently influential
despite substantial variation in surface form. This suggests that unlearning
algorithms are primarily guided by deep semantic cues rather than shallow
lexical patterns.

TL;DR: 提出Value-State Gated Attention (VGA)机制，通过基于价值向量的可学习门控来打破注意力与价值状态之间的恶性循环，有效缓解极端令牌现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer架构的大模型容易受到极端令牌现象（如注意力汇和价值状态流失）的影响，这些问题会降低模型性能、量化保真度和可解释性，源于模型学习到的一种低效的'无操作'行为。

Method: 引入VGA机制，使用直接从价值向量(V)计算的可学习、数据依赖的门控来调节输出，通过理论分析表明这种基于价值状态的门控比先前基于输入嵌入的门控方法更有效。

Result: 实验证明VGA显著减轻了注意力汇的形成并稳定了价值状态规范，带来了性能提升、稳健的量化保真度和增强的模型可解释性。

Conclusion: VGA提供了一种简单、专用且稳定的架构机制，通过直接打破注意力与价值状态之间的恶性循环，有效执行'无操作'注意力。

Abstract: Large models based on the Transformer architecture are susceptible to
extreme-token phenomena, such as attention sinks and value-state drains. These
issues, which degrade model performance, quantization fidelity, and
interpretability, arise from a problematic mutual reinforcement mechanism where
the model learns an inefficient 'no-op' behavior by focusing attention on
tokens with near-zero value states. In this paper, we propose Value-State Gated
Attention (VGA), a simple, dedicated, and stable architectural mechanism for
performing 'no-op' attention efficiently by directly breaking this cycle. VGA
introduces a learnable, data-dependent gate, computed directly from the value
vectors (V), to modulate the output. Through a theoretical analysis of the
underlying gradients, we show that gating the value-state with a function of
itself is more effective at decoupling value and attention score updates than
prior methods that gate on input embeddings. This creates a direct regulatory
pathway that allows the model to suppress a token's contribution based on its
emergent value representation. Our experiments demonstrate that VGA
significantly mitigates the formation of attention sinks and stabilizes
value-state norms, leading to improved performance, robust quantization
fidelity, and enhanced model interpretability.

TL;DR: Slim Scheduler是一个混合调度框架，结合PPO强化学习和贪心调度器，用于可瘦身模型的分布式推理调度，在延迟、能耗和准确率之间实现平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有神经网络调度研究主要关注固定宽度的静态端到端模型，忽略了适应异构硬件和动态运行时条件的动态方法。

Method: 采用分层设计：本地贪心调度器处理请求批处理和实例扩展，PPO路由器学习全局路由策略（设备选择、宽度比例和批配置），降低搜索空间复杂度。

Result: 相比随机任务分配基线，在精度降至最瘦模型（70.3%）时，平均延迟减少96.45%，能耗减少97.31%；在提高精度时也能降低平均延迟和能耗，但延迟和能耗的标准差增加。

Conclusion: 该混合调度框架能有效平衡效率和吞吐量，适应异构硬件环境，实现延迟、能耗和准确率的可调节权衡。

Abstract: Most neural network scheduling research focuses on optimizing static,
end-to-end models of fixed width, overlooking dynamic approaches that adapt to
heterogeneous hardware and fluctuating runtime conditions. We present Slim
Scheduler, a hybrid scheduling framework that integrates a Proximal Policy
Optimization (PPO) reinforcement learning policy with algorithmic, greedy
schedulers to coordinate distributed inference for slimmable models. Each
server runs a local greedy scheduler that batches compatible requests and
manages instance scaling based on VRAM and utilization constraints, while the
PPO router learns global routing policies for device selection, width ratio,
and batch configuration. This hierarchical design reduces search space
complexity, mitigates overfitting to specific hardware, and balances efficiency
and throughput. Compared to a purely randomized task distribution baseline,
Slim Scheduler can achieve various accuracy and latency trade-offs such as: A
96.45% reduction in mean latency and a 97.31% reduction in energy usage
dropping accuracy to the slimmest model available (70.3%). It can then
accomplish an overall reduction in average latency plus energy consumption with
an increase in accuracy at the cost of higher standard deviations of said
latency and energy, effecting overall task throughput.

Abstract: De novo ligand design is a fundamental task that seeks to generate protein or
molecule candidates that can effectively dock with protein receptors and
achieve strong binding affinity entirely from scratch. It holds paramount
significance for a wide spectrum of biomedical applications. However, most
existing studies are constrained by the \textbf{Pseudo De Novo},
\textbf{Limited Docking Modeling}, and \textbf{Inflexible Ligand Type}. To
address these issues, we propose MagicDock, a forward-looking framework
grounded in the progressive pipeline and differentiable surface modeling. (1)
We adopt a well-designed gradient inversion framework. To begin with, general
docking knowledge of receptors and ligands is incorporated into the backbone
model. Subsequently, the docking knowledge is instantiated as reverse gradient
flows by binding prediction, which iteratively guide the de novo generation of
ligands. (2) We emphasize differentiable surface modeling in the docking
process, leveraging learnable 3D point-cloud representations to precisely
capture binding details, thereby ensuring that the generated ligands preserve
docking validity through direct and interpretable spatial fingerprints. (3) We
introduce customized designs for different ligand types and integrate them into
a unified gradient inversion framework with flexible triggers, thereby ensuring
broad applicability. Moreover, we provide rigorous theoretical guarantees for
each component of MagicDock. Extensive experiments across 9 scenarios
demonstrate that MagicDock achieves average improvements of 27.1\% and 11.7\%
over SOTA baselines specialized for protein or molecule ligand design,
respectively.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该研究分析了近十年AI系统训练的环境影响，发现即使采用优化策略，机器学习模型训练的环境影响仍在指数级增长，存在反弹效应，仅靠效率提升无法确保可持续性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着机器学习性能提升，计算需求激增导致能耗和环境问题日益严重，需要评估现有优化策略是否能实现可持续的ML模型训练。

Method: 通过估算近十年包括大语言模型在内的知名AI系统训练的环境影响，重点关注显卡全生命周期的分析。

Result: 发现显卡生产影响持续增长，ML模型训练能耗和环境影响呈指数级增长，优化策略无法抵消训练带来的影响，存在反弹效应。

Conclusion: 仅提高效率无法确保ML可持续性，必须减少AI活动规模、质疑资源密集型训练的频次，并考虑硬件全生命周期而非仅使用阶段的影响。

Abstract: Recent Machine Learning (ML) approaches have shown increased performance on
benchmarks but at the cost of escalating computational demands. Hardware,
algorithmic and carbon optimizations have been proposed to curb energy
consumption and environmental impacts. Can these strategies lead to sustainable
ML model training? Here, we estimate the environmental impacts associated with
training notable AI systems over the last decade, including Large Language
Models, with a focus on the life cycle of graphics cards. Our analysis reveals
two critical trends: First, the impacts of graphics cards production have
increased steadily over this period; Second, energy consumption and
environmental impacts associated with training ML models have increased
exponentially, even when considering reduction strategies such as location
shifting to places with less carbon intensive electricity mixes. Optimization
strategies do not mitigate the impacts induced by model training, evidencing
rebound effect. We show that the impacts of hardware must be considered over
the entire life cycle rather than the sole use phase in order to avoid impact
shifting. Our study demonstrates that increasing efficiency alone cannot ensure
sustainability in ML. Mitigating the environmental impact of AI also requires
reducing AI activities and questioning the scale and frequency of
resource-intensive training.

TL;DR: 该论文批评了当前语言模型防御评估方法的不足，提出应使用自适应攻击者进行更严格的评估，并通过系统优化技术成功绕过了12种现有防御。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前语言模型防御评估存在缺陷，主要使用静态攻击集或弱优化方法，无法真实反映防御能力。

Method: 采用自适应攻击策略，系统调优和扩展通用优化技术（梯度下降、强化学习、随机搜索和人工引导探索）来对抗防御。

Result: 成功绕过了12种近期防御方法，大多数防御的攻击成功率超过90%，而原报告显示接近零攻击成功率。

Conclusion: 未来的防御工作必须考虑更强的攻击方法，才能做出可靠和令人信服的鲁棒性声明。

Abstract: How should we evaluate the robustness of language model defenses? Current
defenses against jailbreaks and prompt injections (which aim to prevent an
attacker from eliciting harmful knowledge or remotely triggering malicious
actions, respectively) are typically evaluated either against a static set of
harmful attack strings, or against computationally weak optimization methods
that were not designed with the defense in mind. We argue that this evaluation
process is flawed.
  Instead, we should evaluate defenses against adaptive attackers who
explicitly modify their attack strategy to counter a defense's design while
spending considerable resources to optimize their objective. By systematically
tuning and scaling general optimization techniques-gradient descent,
reinforcement learning, random search, and human-guided exploration-we bypass
12 recent defenses (based on a diverse set of techniques) with attack success
rate above 90% for most; importantly, the majority of defenses originally
reported near-zero attack success rates. We believe that future defense work
must consider stronger attacks, such as the ones we describe, in order to make
reliable and convincing claims of robustness.

*Jerome Bolte,Quoc-Tung Le,Edouard Pauwels*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文从反向视角出发，假设优化器会收敛到任意点，研究不同优化器作为特征值滤波器的行为。研究发现梯度下降天然避免最尖锐的最小值，而SAM算法更积极地偏好更宽的最小值区域。基于此提出了两种新算法来增强特征值滤波效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络训练中各种优化器往往能找到接近全局最优解，本文从收敛到任意点的假设出发，研究不同优化器作为特征值滤波器的内在机制。

Method: 采用广义Hadamard-Perron稳定流形定理，对一般半代数C²函数进行分析，无需额外非退化条件或全局Lipschitz边界假设。提出了两种增强特征值滤波的新算法。

Result: 理论分析和数值实验表明，标准梯度下降避免最尖锐最小值，SAM算法更积极地偏好宽盆地，新提出的算法能有效促进更宽的最小值。

Conclusion: 不同优化器本质上是特征值滤波器，其超参数决定了滤波行为。这一视角为理解优化器行为提供了新框架，并启发了设计更好优化算法的新思路。

Abstract: Ample empirical evidence in deep neural network training suggests that a
variety of optimizers tend to find nearly global optima. In this article, we
adopt the reversed perspective that convergence to an arbitrary point is
assumed rather than proven, focusing on the consequences of this assumption.
From this viewpoint, in line with recent advances on the edge-of-stability
phenomenon, we argue that different optimizers effectively act as eigenvalue
filters determined by their hyperparameters. Specifically, the standard
gradient descent method inherently avoids the sharpest minima, whereas
Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) algorithms go even further by actively
favoring wider basins. Inspired by these insights, we propose two novel
algorithms that exhibit enhanced eigenvalue filtering, effectively promoting
wider minima. Our theoretical analysis leverages a generalized Hadamard--Perron
stable manifold theorem and applies to general semialgebraic $C^2$ functions,
without requiring additional non-degeneracy conditions or global Lipschitz
bound assumptions. We support our conclusions with numerical experiments on
feed-forward neural networks.

TL;DR: 提出了IGCARL方法，通过战略对抗性攻击和约束强化学习来提高自动驾驶系统的鲁棒性，解决了现有方法在战略攻击、安全事件诱导和学习稳定性方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度强化学习在自动驾驶中表现出色，但对对抗性攻击的脆弱性阻碍了实际部署。现有方法存在三个关键问题：对抗短期攻击、难以引发真正安全事件、训练不稳定。

Method: IGCARL包含战略目标对抗者和鲁棒驾驶代理。对抗者利用DRL的时序决策能力执行战略协调的多步攻击，专注于诱导安全关键事件；驾驶代理通过与对抗者交互学习鲁棒策略，并在约束条件下优化以确保稳定学习。

Result: 实验表明IGCARL相比最先进方法至少提高27.9%的成功率，展现出对对抗性攻击的优越鲁棒性，增强了DRL自动驾驶的安全性和可靠性。

Conclusion: IGCARL通过战略对抗性攻击和约束学习框架，有效解决了自动驾驶系统在对抗性环境中的鲁棒性问题，为DRL在自动驾驶中的安全部署提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has demonstrated remarkable success in
developing autonomous driving policies. However, its vulnerability to
adversarial attacks remains a critical barrier to real-world deployment.
Although existing robust methods have achieved success, they still suffer from
three key issues: (i) these methods are trained against myopic adversarial
attacks, limiting their abilities to respond to more strategic threats, (ii)
they have trouble causing truly safety-critical events (e.g., collisions), but
instead often result in minor consequences, and (iii) these methods can
introduce learning instability and policy drift during training due to the lack
of robust constraints. To address these issues, we propose Intelligent
General-sum Constrained Adversarial Reinforcement Learning (IGCARL), a novel
robust autonomous driving approach that consists of a strategic targeted
adversary and a robust driving agent. The strategic targeted adversary is
designed to leverage the temporal decision-making capabilities of DRL to
execute strategically coordinated multi-step attacks. In addition, it
explicitly focuses on inducing safety-critical events by adopting a general-sum
objective. The robust driving agent learns by interacting with the adversary to
develop a robust autonomous driving policy against adversarial attacks. To
ensure stable learning in adversarial environments and to mitigate policy drift
caused by attacks, the agent is optimized under a constrained formulation.
Extensive experiments show that IGCARL improves the success rate by at least
27.9\% over state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating superior robustness to
adversarial attacks and enhancing the safety and reliability of DRL-based
autonomous driving.

Motivation: 交通是温室气体排放的主要来源，向电动汽车转型具有紧迫性，但充电基础设施空间分布不均和使用不规律给电网稳定性和投资规划带来挑战。

Method: TW-GCN框架结合图卷积网络捕捉空间依赖性和时间架构捕捉时间动态，使用真实交通流量、天气条件和专有EV基础设施数据进行预测。

Abstract: Transportation remains a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions,
highlighting the urgency of transitioning toward sustainable alternatives such
as electric vehicles (EVs). Yet, uneven spatial distribution and irregular
utilization of charging infrastructure create challenges for both power grid
stability and investment planning. This study introduces TW-GCN, a
spatio-temporal forecasting framework that combines Graph Convolutional
Networks with temporal architectures to predict EV charging demand in
Tennessee, United States (U.S.). We utilize real-world traffic flows, weather
conditions, and proprietary data provided by one of the largest EV
infrastructure company in the U.S. to capture both spatial dependencies and
temporal dynamics. Extensive experiments across varying lag horizons,
clustering strategies, and sequence lengths reveal that mid-horizon (3-hour)
forecasts achieve the best balance between responsiveness and stability, with
1DCNN consistently outperforming other temporal models. Regional analysis shows
disparities in predictive accuracy across East, Middle, and West Tennessee,
reflecting how station density, population, and local demand variability shape
model performance. The proposed TW-GCN framework advances the integration of
data-driven intelligence into EV infrastructure planning, supporting both
sustainable mobility transitions and resilient grid management.

*Emilio Mastriani,Alessandro Costa,Federico Incardona,Kevin Munari,Sebastiano Spinello*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文探索了将时间序列分割技术与异构集成方法相结合来提升工业生产中的异常检测性能。通过使用ChangeFinder等变化点检测算法进行预分割，再结合随机森林和XGBoost等集成算法，显著提高了检测准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在工业生产环境中，准确检测异常状态变化对于预防故障和提高生产效率至关重要。传统方法在处理时间序列数据时存在时间不确定性，需要更好的方法来识别正常和异常状态之间的转换。

Method: 采用变化点检测（CPD）算法如ChangeFinder对时间序列进行分割作为预处理步骤，然后使用异构集成方法（随机森林和XGBoost）进行异常检测。

Result: 该方法显著提升了异常检测性能，AUC-ROC指标从0.8599（使用PCA和LSTM集成）提高到0.9760（使用随机森林和XGBoost）。

Conclusion: 时间序列分割作为预处理步骤能够有效减少时间模糊性，促进监督算法的学习过程，显著提升异常检测性能。未来工作将探索结合变化点研究的加权特征来进一步优化早期异常检测。

Abstract: Concerning machine learning, segmentation models can identify state changes
within time series, facilitating the detection of transitions between normal
and anomalous conditions. Specific techniques such as Change Point Detection
(CPD), particularly algorithms like ChangeFinder, have been successfully
applied to segment time series and improve anomaly detection by reducing
temporal uncertainty, especially in multivariate environments. In this work, we
explored how the integration of segmentation techniques, combined with a
heterogeneous ensemble, can enhance anomaly detection in an industrial
production context. The results show that applying segmentation as a
pre-processing step before selecting heterogeneous ensemble algorithms provided
a significant advantage in our case study, improving the AUC-ROC metric from
0.8599 (achieved with a PCA and LSTM ensemble) to 0.9760 (achieved with Random
Forest and XGBoost). This improvement is imputable to the ability of
segmentation to reduce temporal ambiguity and facilitate the learning process
of supervised algorithms. In our future work, we intend to assess the benefit
of introducing weighted features derived from the study of change points,
combined with segmentation and the use of heterogeneous ensembles, to further
optimize model performance in early anomaly detection.

TL;DR: FLToP CTC是一种基于帧级token剪枝的CTC解码算法，通过动态剪枝低概率token来显著降低计算和内存需求，在LibriSpeech上实现10.5倍运行速度提升和2.78倍内存减少，同时保持WER性能几乎不变。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统CTC解码器在资源受限环境中面临计算和内存瓶颈，在系统处理中占用高达90%的时间，主要由于详尽的token级操作导致效率低下。

Method: 提出帧级token剪枝方法，使用相对阈值概率指导，在每帧动态消除低概率token，减少计算和内存需求。

Result: 在LibriSpeech数据集上，FLToP CTC相比标准CTC解码器实现了10.5倍运行速度提升和2.78倍内存减少，同时WER退化可忽略不计。

Conclusion: FLToP CTC有效解决了CTC瓶颈问题，为资源受限环境和实时应用提供了可扩展性，提升了语音识别的可访问性和效率。

Abstract: CTC-based ASR systems face computational and memory bottlenecks in
resource-limited environments. Traditional CTC decoders, requiring up to 90% of
processing time in systems (e.g., wav2vec2-large on L4 GPUs), face
inefficiencies due to exhaustive token-level operations. This paper introduces
Frame Level Token Pruning for Connectionist Temporal Classification (FLToP
CTC), a novel decoding algorithm that employs frame-level token pruning guided
by a relative threshold probability. By dynamically eliminating low-probability
tokens per frame, FLToP CTC reduces compute and memory demands while
maintaining negligible WER degradation. On LibriSpeech, FLToP CTC achieves a
10.5x runtime speedup and 2.78x memory reduction versus standard CTC decoders.
Its simplicity enables seamless integration into CTC decoders across platforms
(CPUs, GPUs, etc.). FLToP CTC addresses CTC bottlenecks, offering scalability
for resource-limited environments and realtime applications, enhancing speech
recognition accessibility and efficiency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经生理记录（如EEG）产生高维、嘈杂的时间序列数据，通常需要大量预处理和手工特征提取。需要一种更有效的方法来解码和解释生物信号。

Method: 提出BioCodec框架，受神经编解码器启发，将生物信号的低级特征捕获为离散标记。在数千小时EEG数据上预训练，适用于多种生物信号类型。

Result: BioCodec在多个下游任务中表现优异，包括临床诊断、睡眠生理学、语音解码和运动想象解码，特别是在低资源设置下。代码本嵌入在EEG连接性中显示出空间一致性。

Conclusion: BioCodec为生物信号标记化提供了一个多功能解决方案，性能与最先进模型相当，适用于多种生物信号数据类型。

Abstract: Neurophysiological recordings such as electroencephalography (EEG) offer
accessible and minimally invasive means of estimating physiological activity
for applications in healthcare, diagnostic screening, and even immersive
entertainment. However, these recordings yield high-dimensional, noisy
time-series data that typically require extensive pre-processing and
handcrafted feature extraction to reveal meaningful information. Recently,
there has been a surge of interest in applying representation learning
techniques from large pre-trained (foundation) models to effectively decode and
interpret biosignals. We discuss the challenges posed for incorporating such
methods and introduce BioCodec, an alternative representation learning
framework inspired by neural codecs to capture low-level signal characteristics
in the form of discrete tokens. Pre-trained on thousands of EEG hours, BioCodec
shows efficacy across multiple downstream tasks, ranging from clinical
diagnostic tasks and sleep physiology to decoding speech and motor imagery,
particularly in low-resource settings. Additionally, we provide a qualitative
analysis of codebook usage and estimate the spatial coherence of codebook
embeddings from EEG connectivity. Notably, we also document the suitability of
our method to other biosignal data, i.e., electromyographic (EMG) signals.
Overall, the proposed approach provides a versatile solution for biosignal
tokenization that performs competitively with state-of-the-art models. The
source code and model checkpoints are shared.

Motivation: 大规模语言模型训练中动量优化器广泛使用但内存消耗大，需要解决动量存储的内存挑战。

Method: 采用非均匀动量设计，对大多数块不使用完整动量，并通过偏置校正技术增强部分动量以减少性能损失。

Result: 在60M到1.5B参数的语言模型预训练、监督微调和RLHF中，减少90%以上动量内存，结合二阶统计量技术可减少95%优化器状态内存，节省30%以上GPU小时。

Conclusion: AdaPM通过部分动量和偏置校正实现了内存高效的优化器，在大规模语言模型训练中显著减少内存消耗同时保持性能。

Abstract: In the training of large language models, momentum is widely used and often
demonstrated to achieve significant acceleration. However, storing momentum
typically presents memory challenges. In this paper, we propose AdaPM, an
adaptive training strategy that leverages partial momentum to implement a
memory-efficient optimizer. To this end, AdaPM utilizes a non-uniform momentum
design: for most blocks, full momentum is not necessary to preserve the
performance of the optimization. In the momentum design of AdaPM, to mitigate
the bias and performance loss caused by partial momentum, we enhance the
partial momentum by a bias correction technique. Empirically, we verify that
our approach reduces memory by over $90\%$ in momentum while maintaining both
efficiency and performance for pretraining various language models ranging from
60M to 1.5B, as well as for supervised fine-tuning and RLHF. AdaPM can further
reduce memory by up to $95\%$ in optimizer states by combining the
memory-efficient technique on the second-order statistic, saving over $30\%$
GPU hours for pretraining GPT-2 1.5B.

methods while maintaining strong robustness against attacks.

Conclusion: 提出的方法能够更准确地评估组隐私风险差异，并通过改进的DP-SGD算法提升差分隐私机器学习中隐私保护的公平性。

Abstract: While significant progress has been made in conventional fairness-aware
machine learning (ML) and differentially private ML (DPML), the fairness of
privacy protection across groups remains underexplored. Existing studies have
proposed methods to assess group privacy risks, but these are based on the
average-case privacy risks of data records. Such approaches may underestimate
the group privacy risks, thereby potentially underestimating the disparity
across group privacy risks. Moreover, the current method for assessing the
worst-case privacy risks of data records is time-consuming, limiting their
practical applicability. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel
membership inference game that can efficiently audit the approximate worst-case
privacy risks of data records. Experimental results demonstrate that our method
provides a more stringent measurement of group privacy risks, yielding a
reliable assessment of the disparity in group privacy risks. Furthermore, to
promote privacy protection fairness in DPML, we enhance the standard DP-SGD
algorithm with an adaptive group-specific gradient clipping strategy, inspired
by the design of canaries in differential privacy auditing studies. Extensive
experiments confirm that our algorithm effectively reduces the disparity in
group privacy risks, thereby enhancing the fairness of privacy protection in
DPML.

Motivation: 在现实世界的在线学习场景中，反馈往往不是即时到达的，而是存在延迟。本文旨在解决具有对抗性延迟的上下文多臂老虎机问题，这是对标准CMAB模型的重要扩展。

Method: 对于有限策略类，直接使用策略类进行学习；对于一般函数逼近设置，使用在线最小二乘回归预言机。还提出了基于Hedge的Vovk聚合预测器的新稳定性分析作为预言机实现。

Result: 在有限策略类下获得了最优期望遗憾界O(√(KT log|Π|) + √(D log|Π|))；在一般函数逼近设置下获得了O(√(KTℛ_T(O)) + √(d_max D β))的遗憾界；使用特定预言机实现时获得O(√(KT log|F|) + √(d_max D log|F|))的遗憾界。

Conclusion: 本文为具有延迟反馈的CMAB问题提供了有效的算法和理论保证，在有限策略类下达到最优，在一般函数逼近设置下与下界相差√d_max因子，为处理延迟反馈的在线学习问题提供了重要进展。

Abstract: We present regret minimization algorithms for the contextual multi-armed
bandit (CMAB) problem over $K$ actions in the presence of delayed feedback, a
scenario where loss observations arrive with delays chosen by an adversary. As
a preliminary result, assuming direct access to a finite policy class $\Pi$ we
establish an optimal expected regret bound of $ O (\sqrt{KT \log |\Pi|} +
\sqrt{D \log |\Pi|)} $ where $D$ is the sum of delays. For our main
contribution, we study the general function approximation setting over a
(possibly infinite) contextual loss function class $ \mathcal{F} $ with access
to an online least-square regression oracle $\mathcal{O}$ over $\mathcal{F}$.
In this setting, we achieve an expected regret bound of
$O(\sqrt{KT\mathcal{R}_T(\mathcal{O})} + \sqrt{ d_{\max} D \beta})$ assuming
FIFO order, where $d_{\max}$ is the maximal delay, $\mathcal{R}_T(\mathcal{O})$
is an upper bound on the oracle's regret and $\beta$ is a stability parameter
associated with the oracle. We complement this general result by presenting a
novel stability analysis of a Hedge-based version of Vovk's aggregating
forecaster as an oracle implementation for least-square regression over a
finite function class $\mathcal{F}$ and show that its stability parameter
$\beta$ is bounded by $\log |\mathcal{F}|$, resulting in an expected regret
bound of $O(\sqrt{KT \log |\mathcal{F}|} + \sqrt{d_{\max} D \log
|\mathcal{F}|})$ which is a $\sqrt{d_{\max}}$ factor away from the lower bound
of $\Omega(\sqrt{KT \log |\mathcal{F}|} + \sqrt{D \log |\mathcal{F}|})$ that we
also present.

Result: 该方法能够仅使用数百到数千个成对比较，成功学习模拟专家的复杂多元信念密度。

Conclusion: 通过将目标密度与温度调节的胜者密度关联，并利用分数匹配和扩散模型，实现了从有限成对比较数据中有效估计复杂密度函数。

Abstract: We study density estimation from pairwise comparisons, motivated by expert
knowledge elicitation and learning from human feedback. We relate the
unobserved target density to a tempered winner density (marginal density of
preferred choices), learning the winner's score via score-matching. This allows
estimating the target by `de-tempering' the estimated winner density's score.
We prove that the score vectors of the belief and the winner density are
collinear, linked by a position-dependent tempering field. We give analytical
formulas for this field and propose an estimator for it under the Bradley-Terry
model. Using a diffusion model trained on tempered samples generated via
score-scaled annealed Langevin dynamics, we can learn complex multivariate
belief densities of simulated experts, from only hundreds to thousands of
pairwise comparisons.

*Suming Qiu,Jing Li,Zhicheng Zhou,Junjie Huang,Linyuan Qiu,Zhijie Sun*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出Logits Replay + MoClip框架，通过压缩logit空间的监督信号和稳定优化过程，在提升LLM领域性能的同时减少通用能力遗忘，并降低40%以上训练成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM领域适应中的权衡问题：提升特定领域能力通常会导致通用能力下降，现有方法在计算、数据访问或适应性方面成本高昂。

Method: 两阶段框架：Stage 0记录动态Top-K token子集（包含黄金标签），Stage 1重放这些紧凑子集计算精确重归一化损失；设计MoClip优化器限制梯度动量旋转并基于arctan2重新缩放更新。

Result: 在通信技术和NL2SQL任务上提升领域性能，在通用基准（MMLU、BBH、GPQA、MATH）上减轻遗忘，训练成本降低40%以上。

Conclusion: 该方法为LLM领域适应提供了可扩展、架构无关的路径，无需牺牲泛化能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often face a trade-off in post-training:
improvements on specialized domains frequently come at the expense of general
capabilities. Existing solutions attempt to mitigate this tension via
regularization, selective parameter updates, or data-centric replay, but each
imposes significant costs in computation, data access, or adaptability. Recent
work has shown that training signals can be compressed to subsets of logits
without severe accuracy loss, suggesting a path toward efficient adaptation.
However, naive truncation destabilizes optimization and exacerbates forgetting.
  We introduce Logits Replay + MoClip, a two-stage framework that compresses
supervision in the logit space and stabilizes optimization at the update level.
In Stage 0, we record dynamic Top-K token subsets that cover a probability
threshold, always including the gold label. In Stage 1, we replay these compact
subsets to compute exact renormalized losses, avoiding full softmax computation
and implicitly regularizing. To ensure stability, we design MoClip, an
optimizer that caps gradient-momentum rotation and applies an arctan2-based
rescaling of updates. Empirically, our method improves domain performance on
Communication Technology (CT) and NL2SQL tasks while mitigating forgetting on
general benchmarks (MMLU, BBH, GPQA, MATH), and reduces training cost by over
40%. Together, these contributions offer a scalable, architecture-agnostic path
for domain adaptation of LLMs without sacrificing generalization.

TL;DR: Agentic-KGR是一个通过多轮强化学习实现大语言模型与知识图谱协同进化的框架，解决了静态知识库的覆盖不足和时效性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于知识增强的大语言模型依赖静态知识库，存在覆盖不足和时效性差的问题，限制了在动态信息环境中的有效性。

Method: 提出三个关键创新：动态模式扩展机制、检索增强记忆系统、可学习的多尺度提示压缩方法，通过多轮强化学习实现模型与知识图谱的协同进化。

Result: 实验结果显示在知识抽取任务中显著优于监督基线和单轮强化学习方法，与GraphRAG集成后在问答任务中取得更优性能，准确率和知识覆盖率均有显著提升。

Conclusion: Agentic-KGR框架通过协同进化机制有效解决了知识图谱的覆盖不足和时效性问题，为动态知识增强提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Current knowledge-enhanced large language models (LLMs) rely on static,
pre-constructed knowledge bases that suffer from coverage gaps and temporal
obsolescence, limiting their effectiveness in dynamic information environments.
We present Agentic-KGR, a novel framework enabling co-evolution between LLMs
and knowledge graphs (KGs) through multi-round reinforcement learning (RL). Our
approach introduces three key innovations: (1) a dynamic schema expansion
mechanism that systematically extends graph ontologies beyond pre-defined
boundaries during training; (2) a retrieval-augmented memory system enabling
synergistic co-evolution between model parameters and knowledge structures
through continuous optimization; (3) a learnable multi-scale prompt compression
approach that preserves critical information while reducing computational
complexity through adaptive sequence optimization. Experimental results
demonstrate substantial improvements over supervised baselines and single-round
RL approaches in knowledge extraction tasks. When integrated with GraphRAG, our
method achieves superior performance in downstream QA tasks, with significant
gains in both accuracy and knowledge coverage compared to existing methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该研究提出了首个系统性的EHR表示方法基准测试，比较了时间序列、事件流和文本事件流三种范式，发现在不同临床场景下事件流模型表现最佳，且特征选择策略需根据具体临床任务调整。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电子健康记录(EHR)支持临床预测的深度学习应用，但由于评估实践不一致，患者数据的最佳表示方法仍不明确，需要建立标准化基准来比较不同EHR表示方法。

Method: 构建统一基准，在MIMIC-IV(ICU任务)和EHRSHOT(纵向护理)数据集上标准化数据整理和评估，比较三种表示范式：多元时间序列、事件流和文本事件流，并评估相应的模型家族和特征剪枝策略。

Result: 事件流模型始终表现最佳；预训练模型在少样本场景中样本效率高；特征选择策略需适应临床场景：ICU预测中剪枝稀疏特征有益，而纵向任务中保留这些特征至关重要。

Conclusion: 通过统一可复现的流程，研究结果为基于临床环境和数据状况选择EHR表示方法提供了实用指导，事件流是推荐的表示范式。

Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHRs) enable deep learning for clinical
predictions, but the optimal method for representing patient data remains
unclear due to inconsistent evaluation practices. We present the first
systematic benchmark to compare EHR representation methods, including
multivariate time-series, event streams, and textual event streams for LLMs.
This benchmark standardises data curation and evaluation across two distinct
clinical settings: the MIMIC-IV dataset for ICU tasks (mortality, phenotyping)
and the EHRSHOT dataset for longitudinal care (30-day readmission, 1-year
pancreatic cancer). For each paradigm, we evaluate appropriate modelling
families--including Transformers, MLP, LSTMs and Retain for time-series, CLMBR
and count-based models for event streams, 8-20B LLMs for textual streams--and
analyse the impact of feature pruning based on data missingness. Our
experiments reveal that event stream models consistently deliver the strongest
performance. Pre-trained models like CLMBR are highly sample-efficient in
few-shot settings, though simpler count-based models can be competitive given
sufficient data. Furthermore, we find that feature selection strategies must be
adapted to the clinical setting: pruning sparse features improves ICU
predictions, while retaining them is critical for longitudinal tasks. Our
results, enabled by a unified and reproducible pipeline, provide practical
guidance for selecting EHR representations based on the clinical context and
data regime.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: WASI是一种应用于Transformer模型的子空间训练方法，通过限制训练在固定子空间内进行，显著减少了内存使用和计算成本，同时保持与普通训练相当的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI在日常生活中的应用增加，能耗和数据隐私成为紧迫问题。设备端学习能降低能耗并保护数据隐私，但现代神经网络规模的扩大给设备端训练带来了障碍。

Method: 应用基于子空间的训练方法到Transformer模型，提出Weight-Activation Subspace Iteration (WASI)，通过将训练限制在固定子空间内来缓解反向传播的内存瓶颈并提升推理效率。

Result: WASI在保持与普通训练相当准确性的同时，将内存使用减少高达62倍，计算成本(FLOPs)减少高达2倍。在Raspberry Pi 5上，WASI实现了约1.5倍的训练和推理加速。

Conclusion: WASI方法有效解决了Transformer模型在设备端训练中的内存和计算瓶颈问题，为边缘设备上的高效AI训练提供了可行方案。

Abstract: As AI increasingly shapes daily life, energy consumption and data privacy
have become pressing concerns. On-device learning trains models directly on
edge devices, cutting energy consumption and safeguarding data privacy.
However, the expanding scale of modern neural networks creates a major obstacle
for on-device training. Although prior work has concentrated on compact
convolutional architectures, we instead apply subspace-based training to
transformer models. Motivated by the idea that a model's essential information
lies in a fixed subspace, we introduce Weight-Activation Subspace Iteration
(WASI), a method that mitigates the memory bottleneck of backpropagation and
boosts inference efficiency in transformer models by restricting training to
this subspace. Our results demonstrate that WASI maintains accuracy comparable
to vanilla training while reducing memory usage by up to $62\times$ and
computational cost (FLOPs) by up to $2\times$. On a Raspberry Pi 5, WASI
achieves roughly $1.5\times$ faster training and inference than vanilla
training.

Motivation: 深入分析Git Re-Basin这一新的模型融合方法，探索其在实际应用中的表现和局限性。

Method: 提出了分层模型融合方案，与标准MergeMany算法进行对比实验。

Result: 分层融合方案显著优于标准算法，Re-Basin能增强模型的对抗和扰动鲁棒性，且参与融合的模型越多效果越强，但性能下降比原作者报告的要大。

Conclusion: Git Re-Basin方法在鲁棒性方面有优势，但实际性能损失比预期更大，需要进一步优化。

Abstract: This paper takes a closer look at Git Re-Basin, an interesting new approach
to merge trained models. We propose a hierarchical model merging scheme that
significantly outperforms the standard MergeMany algorithm. With our new
algorithm, we find that Re-Basin induces adversarial and perturbation
robustness into the merged models, with the effect becoming stronger the more
models participate in the hierarchical merging scheme. However, in our
experiments Re-Basin induces a much bigger performance drop than reported by
the original authors.

TL;DR: 提出GCM框架，通过全局约束从数据分布中端到端学习功能脑网络的高阶结构，在5个数据集上相比基线方法提升30.6%准确率并减少96.3%计算时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统功能脑网络建模依赖局部成对交互，难以捕捉高阶依赖关系；现有超图建模方法计算负担重且依赖启发式方法，无法直接从数据分布进行端到端学习。

Method: 提出GCM框架，整合4种全局约束（信号同步、被试身份、期望边数、数据标签）来学习4个不同分辨率水平（样本/被试/组/项目）的功能脑网络结构。

Result: 在5个数据集和2种任务设置下，相比9个基线和10个先进方法，GCM实现了30.6%的相对准确率提升和96.3%的计算时间减少。

Conclusion: 该工作为功能脑网络结构学习提供了新视角，为认知神经科学的跨学科应用奠定了基础。

Abstract: Functional brain network (FBN) modeling often relies on local pairwise
interactions, whose limitation in capturing high-order dependencies is
theoretically analyzed in this paper. Meanwhile, the computational burden and
heuristic nature of current hypergraph modeling approaches hinder end-to-end
learning of FBN structures directly from data distributions. To address this,
we propose to extract high-order FBN structures under global constraints, and
implement this as a Global Constraints oriented Multi-resolution (GCM) FBN
structure learning framework. It incorporates 4 types of global constraint
(signal synchronization, subject identity, expected edge numbers, and data
labels) to enable learning FBN structures for 4 distinct levels
(sample/subject/group/project) of modeling resolution. Experimental results
demonstrate that GCM achieves up to a 30.6% improvement in relative accuracy
and a 96.3% reduction in computational time across 5 datasets and 2 task
settings, compared to 9 baselines and 10 state-of-the-art methods. Extensive
experiments validate the contributions of individual components and highlight
the interpretability of GCM. This work offers a novel perspective on FBN
structure learning and provides a foundation for interdisciplinary applications
in cognitive neuroscience. Code is publicly available on

TL;DR: 本文揭示了持续学习中灾难性遗忘的根本原因：新任务训练本质上是对旧任务知识的对抗性攻击，新任务梯度会自动与旧任务损失函数的尖锐方向对齐，导致旧任务损失快速增加。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解深度网络中灾难性遗忘的深层原因，揭示新任务训练如何导致旧任务知识的快速遗忘。

Method: 通过理论分析发现训练的低秩偏置导致新旧任务梯度在同一低维子空间中对齐，提出backGP方法来解决反向传播引起的对齐问题。

Result: backGP方法相比梯度投影方法平均减少10.8%的遗忘，提高12.7%的准确率。

Conclusion: 灾难性遗忘源于新任务训练对旧任务的对抗性攻击，backGP能有效缓解由反向传播引起的梯度对齐问题。

Abstract: Continual learning seeks the human-like ability to accumulate new skills in
machine intelligence. Its central challenge is catastrophic forgetting, whose
underlying cause has not been fully understood for deep networks. In this
paper, we demystify catastrophic forgetting by revealing that the new-task
training is implicitly an adversarial attack against the old-task knowledge.
Specifically, the new-task gradients automatically and accurately align with
the sharp directions of the old-task loss landscape, rapidly increasing the
old-task loss. This adversarial alignment is intriguingly counter-intuitive
because the sharp directions are too sparsely distributed to align with by
chance. To understand it, we theoretically show that it arises from training's
low-rank bias, which, through forward and backward propagation, confines the
two directions into the same low-dimensional subspace, facilitating alignment.
Gradient projection (GP) methods, a representative family of
forgetting-mitigating methods, reduce adversarial alignment caused by forward
propagation, but cannot address the alignment due to backward propagation. We
propose backGP to address it, which reduces forgetting by 10.8% and improves
accuracy by 12.7% on average over GP methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习中非确定性和不可重现性是重要挑战，导致跨运行和平台的结果不一致。这些问题源于随机数生成和浮点计算，其中随机性可以通过确定性配置控制，但浮点不一致性仍未解决。

Method: 开发RepDL开源库，通过强制浮点计算的正确舍入和顺序不变性来实现确定性和比特级可重现性。

Conclusion: RepDL为解决深度学习中的浮点不一致性问题提供了有效解决方案，有助于提高实验的可重现性和可靠性。

Abstract: Non-determinism and non-reproducibility present significant challenges in
deep learning, leading to inconsistent results across runs and platforms. These
issues stem from two origins: random number generation and floating-point
computation. While randomness can be controlled through deterministic
configurations, floating-point inconsistencies remain largely unresolved. To
address this, we introduce RepDL, an open-source library that ensures
deterministic and bitwise-reproducible deep learning training and inference
across diverse computing environments. RepDL achieves this by enforcing correct
rounding and order invariance in floating-point computation. The source code is
available at https://github.com/microsoft/RepDL .

TL;DR: 本文提出了多模态提示优化问题，并开发了MPO框架，通过联合优化文本和非文本提示来提升多模态大语言模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前提示优化方法局限于文本领域，无法充分发挥多模态大语言模型的潜力，因此需要将提示优化扩展到多模态空间。

Method: 提出多模态提示优化器(MPO)，通过保持对齐的联合更新来优化多模态提示，并利用贝叶斯选择策略基于先前评估指导候选提示选择。

Result: 在图像、视频、分子等多种模态上的实验表明，MPO优于领先的纯文本优化方法。

Conclusion: 多模态提示优化是实现多模态大语言模型潜力的关键步骤。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable success, and their
multimodal expansions (MLLMs) further unlock capabilities spanning images,
videos, and other modalities beyond text. However, despite this shift, prompt
optimization approaches, designed to reduce the burden of manual prompt
crafting while maximizing performance, remain confined to text, ultimately
limiting the full potential of MLLMs. Motivated by this gap, we introduce the
new problem of multimodal prompt optimization, which expands the prior
definition of prompt optimization to the multimodal space defined by the pairs
of textual and non-textual prompts. To tackle this problem, we then propose the
Multimodal Prompt Optimizer (MPO), a unified framework that not only performs
the joint optimization of multimodal prompts through alignment-preserving
updates but also guides the selection process of candidate prompts by
leveraging earlier evaluations as priors in a Bayesian-based selection
strategy. Through extensive experiments across diverse modalities that go
beyond text, such as images, videos, and even molecules, we demonstrate that
MPO outperforms leading text-only optimization methods, establishing multimodal
prompt optimization as a crucial step to realizing the potential of MLLMs.

Motivation: Flow Matching在模仿学习中表现出色，但缺乏环境交互和探索，导致在未见场景中泛化能力差。在线优化FM策略又面临梯度不稳定和高推理成本的挑战。

Method: 使用简单的MLP学生策略进行在线探索和RL更新，同时利用教师FM模型构建奖励函数并正则化学生策略行为，既保留FM的表达能力又避免其计算问题。

Conclusion: 通过教师-学生框架结合FM的表达能力和MLP的在线学习效率，有效解决了FM策略在在线强化学习中的局限性。

Abstract: Flow Matching (FM) has shown remarkable ability in modeling complex
distributions and achieves strong performance in offline imitation learning for
cloning expert behaviors. However, despite its behavioral cloning
expressiveness, FM-based policies are inherently limited by their lack of
environmental interaction and exploration. This leads to poor generalization in
unseen scenarios beyond the expert demonstrations, underscoring the necessity
of online interaction with environment. Unfortunately, optimizing FM policies
via online interaction is challenging and inefficient due to instability in
gradient computation and high inference costs. To address these issues, we
propose to let a student policy with simple MLP structure explore the
environment and be online updated via RL algorithm with a reward model. This
reward model is associated with a teacher FM model, containing rich information
of expert data distribution. Furthermore, the same teacher FM model is utilized
to regularize the student policy's behavior to stabilize policy learning. Due
to the student's simple architecture, we avoid the gradient instability of FM
policies and enable efficient online exploration, while still leveraging the
expressiveness of the teacher FM model. Extensive experiments show that our
approach significantly enhances learning efficiency, generalization, and
robustness, especially when learning from suboptimal expert data.

Abstract: Machine learning models that predict the feasibility of chemical reactions
have become central to automated synthesis planning. Despite their predictive
success, these models often lack transparency and interpretability. We
introduce a novel formulation of prime implicant explanations--also known as

for computing such explanations in small-scale reaction prediction tasks.
Preliminary experiments demonstrate that our notion of prime implicant
explanations conservatively captures the ground truth explanations. That is,
such explanations often contain redundant bonds and atoms but consistently
capture the molecular attributes that are essential for predicting reaction
feasibility.

Abstract: In collaborative data sharing and machine learning, multiple parties
aggregate their data resources to train a machine learning model with better
model performance. However, as the parties incur data collection costs, they
are only willing to do so when guaranteed incentives, such as fairness and
individual rationality. Existing frameworks assume that all parties join the
collaboration simultaneously, which does not hold in many real-world scenarios.
Due to the long processing time for data cleaning, difficulty in overcoming
legal barriers, or unawareness, the parties may join the collaboration at
different times. In this work, we propose the following perspective: As a party
who joins earlier incurs higher risk and encourages the contribution from other
wait-and-see parties, that party should receive a reward of higher value for
sharing data earlier. To this end, we propose a fair and time-aware data
sharing framework, including novel time-aware incentives. We develop new
methods for deciding reward values to satisfy these incentives. We further
illustrate how to generate model rewards that realize the reward values and
empirically demonstrate the properties of our methods on synthetic and
real-world datasets.

Abstract: We close open theoretical gaps in Multi-Agent Imitation Learning (MAIL) by
characterizing the limits of non-interactive MAIL and presenting the first
interactive algorithm with near-optimal sample complexity. In the
non-interactive setting, we prove a statistical lower bound that identifies the
all-policy deviation concentrability coefficient as the fundamental complexity
measure, and we show that Behavior Cloning (BC) is rate-optimal. For the
interactive setting, we introduce a framework that combines reward-free
reinforcement learning with interactive MAIL and instantiate it with an
algorithm, MAIL-WARM. It improves the best previously known sample complexity
from $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-8})$ to $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^{-2}),$
matching the dependence on $\varepsilon$ implied by our lower bound. Finally,
we provide numerical results that support our theory and illustrate, in
environments such as grid worlds, where Behavior Cloning fails to learn.

the Caucasus - including Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, Kazakhstan, and Azerbaijan -
where frequent and unpredictable macroeconomics shocks destabilize financial
data. To the best of our knowledge, this is among the first studies to examine
drift mitigation methods on financial datasets from these regions. We
investigate the use of synthetic outliers, a largely unexplored approach, to
improve model stability against unforeseen shocks. To evaluate effectiveness,
we introduce a two-level framework that measures both the extent of performance
degradation and the severity of shocks. Our experiments on macroeconomic
tabular datasets show that adding a small proportion of synthetic outliers
generally improves stability compared to baseline models, though the optimal
amount varies by dataset and model

Motivation: 探索在大规模LLM预训练中，计算效率高的近似方法会损失多少性能，通过应用完整高斯-牛顿预条件处理来建立迭代复杂度的实际上界。

Method: 对最多1.5亿参数的Transformer模型应用完整高斯-牛顿预条件处理，并与SOAP、Muon等强基线进行比较，同时测试精确的层间高斯-牛顿预条件处理器的效果。

Result: 完整高斯-牛顿更新相比现有优化器带来显著增益，训练迭代次数减少5.4倍；层间高斯-牛顿预条件处理器几乎能匹配完整高斯-牛顿方法的性能。

Conclusion: 高斯-牛顿近似对预条件处理非常有效，高阶损失项对收敛速度可能不关键；层间海森结构包含足够信息实现大部分潜在增益；当前近似方法与理想层间预言机存在显著性能差距。

Abstract: Recent efforts to accelerate LLM pretraining have focused on
computationally-efficient approximations that exploit second-order structure.
This raises a key question for large-scale training: how much performance is
forfeited by these approximations? To probe this question, we establish a
practical upper bound on iteration complexity by applying full Gauss-Newton
(GN) preconditioning to transformer models of up to 150M parameters. Our
experiments show that full GN updates yield substantial gains over existing
optimizers, achieving a 5.4x reduction in training iterations compared to
strong baselines like SOAP and Muon. Furthermore, we find that a precise
layerwise GN preconditioner, which ignores cross-layer information, nearly
matches the performance of the full GN method. Collectively, our results
suggest: (1) the GN approximation is highly effective for preconditioning,
implying higher-order loss terms may not be critical for convergence speed; (2)
the layerwise Hessian structure contains sufficient information to achieve most
of these potential gains; and (3) a significant performance gap exists between
current approximate methods and an idealized layerwise oracle.

Abstract: A prompt is a natural language instruction that defines a specific task for a
large language model (LLM) and serves as the primary interface for human-LLM
interaction. With the growing deployment of LLMs, diverse prompt datasets are
emerging from platforms such as GitHub and social media. These datasets span a
wide array of applications and content types, facilitating both broader LLM
utilization and improved prompt engineering. In this work, we--for the first
time--have compiled an extensive list of prompt datasets sourced from various
channels, representing a spectrum of downstream tasks, languages, engineering
techniques, attributes, and modalities. We select key representative datasets
for systematic analysis, revealing commonalities and differences in prompt
construction across categories, distinguishing them from other text corpora
like literature and web. We further propose a prompt optimization approach that
leverages syntactic embeddings of part-of-speech and dependency structures. By
identifying a centroid representation of prompts and guiding LLMs to rewrite
prompts toward this centroid, our method improves the meaningfulness of model
outputs. We have made our datasets and code available.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然softmax注意力驱动了最先进的序列模型性能，但其二次复杂度限制了可扩展性，促使研究线性替代方案如状态空间模型。然而这些替代方案在信息处理方面的根本差异仍未得到充分理解。

Method: 利用动力系统框架将各种注意力机制表示为动力系统，通过分析特征值谱进行结构化比较，并在多种序列模型和基准测试上进行广泛的实证分析。

Conclusion: 特征值分析为解释、理解并最终改进序列模型能力提供了一个原则性的度量标准。

Abstract: Although softmax attention drives state-of-the-art performance for sequence
models, its quadratic complexity limits scalability, motivating linear
alternatives such as state space models (SSMs). While these alternatives
improve efficiency, their fundamental differences in information processing
remain poorly understood. In this work, we leverage the recently proposed
dynamical systems framework to represent softmax, norm and linear attention as
dynamical systems, enabling a structured comparison with SSMs by analyzing
their respective eigenvalue spectra. Since eigenvalues capture essential
aspects of dynamical system behavior, we conduct an extensive empirical
analysis across diverse sequence models and benchmarks. We first show that
eigenvalues influence essential aspects of memory and long-range dependency
modeling, revealing spectral signatures that align with task requirements.
Building on these insights, we then investigate how architectural modifications
in sequence models impact both eigenvalue spectra and task performance. This
correspondence further strengthens the position of eigenvalue analysis as a
principled metric for interpreting, understanding, and ultimately improving the
capabilities of sequence models.

Abstract: Deep sequence models, ranging from Transformers and State Space Models (SSMs)
to more recent approaches such as gated linear RNNs, fundamentally compute
outputs as linear combinations of past value vectors. To draw insights and
systematically compare such architectures, we develop a unified framework that
makes this output operation explicit, by casting the linear combination
coefficients as the outputs of autonomous linear dynamical systems driven by
impulse inputs. This viewpoint, in spirit substantially different from
approaches focusing on connecting linear RNNs with linear attention, reveals a
common mathematical theme across diverse architectures and crucially captures
softmax attention, on top of RNNs, SSMs, and related models. In contrast to new
model proposals that are commonly evaluated on benchmarks, we derive design
principles linking architectural choices to model properties. Thereby
identifying tradeoffs between expressivity and efficient implementation,
geometric constraints on input selectivity, and stability conditions for
numerically stable training and information retention. By connecting several
insights and observations from recent literature, the framework both explains
empirical successes of recent designs and provides guiding principles for
systematically designing new sequence model architectures.

Abstract: Ensuring that large language models (LLMs) comply with safety requirements is
a central challenge in AI deployment. Existing alignment approaches primarily
operate during training, such as through fine-tuning or reinforcement learning
from human feedback, but these methods are costly and inflexible, requiring
retraining whenever new requirements arise. Recent efforts toward
inference-time alignment mitigate some of these limitations but still assume
access to model internals, which is impractical, and not suitable for third
party stakeholders who do not have access to the models. In this work, we
propose a model-independent, black-box framework for safety alignment that does
not require retraining or access to the underlying LLM architecture. As a proof
of concept, we address the problem of trading off between generating safe but
uninformative answers versus helpful yet potentially risky ones. We formulate
this dilemma as a two-player zero-sum game whose minimax equilibrium captures
the optimal balance between safety and helpfulness. LLM agents operationalize
this framework by leveraging a linear programming solver at inference time to
compute equilibrium strategies. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of
black-box safety alignment, offering a scalable and accessible pathway for
stakeholders, including smaller organizations and entities in
resource-constrained settings, to enforce safety across rapidly evolving LLM
ecosystems.

Conclusion: 单峰偏好结构能够有效解决在线随机匹配问题的计算复杂性，为具有结构化偏好的匹配问题提供了高效的解决方案。

Abstract: We study an online stochastic matching problem in which an algorithm
sequentially matches $U$ users to $K$ arms, aiming to maximize cumulative
reward over $T$ rounds under budget constraints. Without structural
assumptions, computing the optimal matching is NP-hard, making online learning
computationally infeasible. To overcome this barrier, we focus on
\emph{single-peaked preferences} -- a well-established structure in social
choice theory, where users' preferences are unimodal with respect to a common
order over arms. We devise an efficient algorithm for the offline budgeted
matching problem, and leverage it into an efficient online algorithm with a
regret of $\tilde O(UKT^{2/3})$. Our approach relies on a novel PQ tree-based
order approximation method. If the single-peaked structure is known, we develop
an efficient UCB-like algorithm that achieves a regret bound of $\tilde
O(U\sqrt{TK})$.

Motivation: 生成模型评估中，标准指标往往无法反映人类偏好，而人工评估虽然更可靠但成本高且噪声大，现有Bradley-Terry方法要么忽略评估者变异性，要么缺乏收敛保证。

Method: 提出BBQ方法，使用贝叶斯框架显式建模评估者质量，通过期望最大化算法提供单调似然收敛保证，能够降低不可靠参与者的权重或将其排除。

Conclusion: 该框架能够实现更可靠和成本效益更高的生成模型人类评估。

Abstract: Evaluating generative models is challenging because standard metrics often
fail to reflect human preferences. Human evaluations are more reliable but
costly and noisy, as participants vary in expertise, attention, and diligence.
Pairwise comparisons improve consistency, yet aggregating them into overall
quality scores requires careful modeling. Bradley-Terry-based methods update
item scores from comparisons, but existing approaches either ignore rater
variability or lack convergence guarantees, limiting robustness and
interpretability. We introduce BBQ, a Bayesian Bradley-Terry variant that
explicitly models rater quality, downweighting or removing unreliable
participants, and provides guaranteed monotonic likelihood convergence through
an Expectation-Maximization algorithm. Empirical results show that BBQ achieves
faster convergence, well-calibrated uncertainty estimates, and more robust,
interpretable rankings compared to baseline Bradley-Terry models, even with
noisy or crowdsourced raters. This framework enables more reliable and
cost-effective human evaluation of generative models.

Abstract: The operational efficiency of railway networks, a cornerstone of modern
economies, is persistently undermined by the cascading effects of train delays.
Accurately forecasting this delay propagation is a critical challenge for
real-time traffic management. While recent research has leveraged Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs) to model the network structure of railways, a significant gap
remains in developing frameworks that provide multi-step autoregressive
forecasts at a network-wide scale, while simultaneously offering the live,
interpretable explanations needed for decision support. This paper addresses
this gap by developing and evaluating a novel XGeoAI framework for live,
explainable, multi-step train delay forecasting. The core of this work is a
two-stage, autoregressive Graph Attention Network (GAT) model, trained on a
real-world dataset covering over 40% of the Dutch railway network. The model
represents the system as a spatio-temporal graph of operational events
(arrivals and departures) and is enriched with granular features, including
platform and station congestion. To test its viability for live deployment, the
model is rigorously evaluated using a sequential, k-step-ahead forecasting
protocol that simulates real-world conditions where prediction errors can
compound. The results demonstrate that while the proposed GATv2 model is
challenged on pure error metrics (MAE) by a simpler Persistence baseline, it
achieves consistently higher precision in classifying delay events -- a crucial
advantage for a reliable decision support tool.

Motivation: 现有的AI控制协议主要依赖LLM监控器作为防御机制，但这些监控器可能成为单点故障。作者旨在研究当不受信任的模型了解协议和监控模型时的自适应攻击风险。

Method: 作者实例化了一种简单的自适应攻击向量，攻击者在模型输出中嵌入公开已知或零样本提示注入，并在两个主要AI控制基准上测试这种攻击的有效性。

Result: 前沿模型能够持续规避各种监控器并完成恶意任务。这种攻击对当前依赖监控器的所有协议都有效，而Defer-to-Resample协议甚至会产生反效果，其重采样机制会放大提示注入攻击。

Conclusion: 对监控模型的自适应攻击是当前控制协议的主要盲点，应该成为未来AI控制机制评估的标准组成部分。

Abstract: AI control protocols serve as a defense mechanism to stop untrusted LLM
agents from causing harm in autonomous settings. Prior work treats this as a
security problem, stress testing with exploits that use the deployment context
to subtly complete harmful side tasks, such as backdoor insertion. In practice,
most AI control protocols are fundamentally based on LLM monitors, which can
become a central point of failure. We study adaptive attacks by an untrusted
model that knows the protocol and the monitor model, which is plausible if the
untrusted model was trained with a later knowledge cutoff or can search for
this information autonomously. We instantiate a simple adaptive attack vector
by which the attacker embeds publicly known or zero-shot prompt injections in
the model outputs. Using this tactic, frontier models consistently evade
diverse monitors and complete malicious tasks on two main AI control
benchmarks. The attack works universally against current protocols that rely on
a monitor. Furthermore, the recent Defer-to-Resample protocol even backfires,
as its resampling amplifies the prompt injection and effectively reframes it as
a best-of-$n$ attack. In general, adaptive attacks on monitor models represent
a major blind spot in current control protocols and should become a standard
component of evaluations for future AI control mechanisms.

Abstract: Kidneys are the filter of the human body. About 10% of the global population
is thought to be affected by Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD), which causes kidney
function to decline. To protect in danger patients from additional kidney
damage, effective risk evaluation of CKD and appropriate CKD monitoring are
crucial. Due to quick and precise detection capabilities, Machine Learning
models can help practitioners accomplish this goal efficiently; therefore, an
enormous number of diagnosis systems and processes in the healthcare sector
nowadays are relying on machine learning due to its disease prediction
capability. In this study, we designed and suggested disease predictive
computer-aided designs for the diagnosis of CKD. The dataset for CKD is
attained from the repository of machine learning of UCL, with a few missing
values; those are filled in using "mean-mode" and "Random sampling method"
strategies. After successfully achieving the missing data, eight ML techniques
(Random Forest, SVM, Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, KNN, XGBoost, Decision
Tree, and AdaBoost) were used to establish models, and the performance
evaluation comparisons among the result accuracies are measured by the
techniques to find the machine learning models with the highest accuracy. Among
them, Random Forest as well as Logistic Regression showed an outstanding 99%
accuracy, followed by the Ada Boost, XGBoost, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, and
SVM, whereas the KNN classifier model stands last with an accuracy of 73%.

Conclusion: CHUCKLE框架通过整合人类感知难度，有效提升了情感识别模型的训练效率和鲁棒性，证明了在主观任务中考虑人类感知难度的重要性。

Abstract: Curriculum learning (CL) structures training from simple to complex samples,
facilitating progressive learning. However, existing CL approaches for emotion
recognition often rely on heuristic, data-driven, or model-based definitions of
sample difficulty, neglecting the difficulty for human perception, a critical
factor in subjective tasks like emotion recognition. We propose CHUCKLE
(Crowdsourced Human Understanding Curriculum for Knowledge Led Emotion
Recognition), a perception-driven CL framework that leverages annotator
agreement and alignment in crowd-sourced datasets to define sample difficulty,
under the assumption that clips challenging for humans are similarly hard for
machine learning models. Empirical results suggest that CHUCKLE increases the
relative mean accuracy by 6.56% for LSTMs and 1.61% for Transformers over
non-curriculum baselines, while reducing the number of gradient updates,
thereby enhancing both training efficiency and model robustness.

Motivation: 当前生成模型依赖大量监督数据和信息丰富的奖励函数，但在困难问题中面临两个挑战：(1)基础生成模型获得接近零的奖励信号，(2)奖励函数调用成本高昂。

Method: 将学习失败规律建模为另一个生成建模问题，利用该模型评估新数据是否类似先前失败，从而引导生成远离失败模式。

Result: BaNEL在多个稀疏奖励任务中无需观察任何成功样本即可提升性能，比现有新颖性奖励方法高出数个数量级的成功率，同时使用更少的奖励评估。

Conclusion: BaNEL为在稀疏奖励和昂贵奖励评估场景下的模型后训练提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Today's generative models thrive with large amounts of supervised data and
informative reward functions characterizing the quality of the generation. They
work under the assumptions that the supervised data provides knowledge to
pre-train the model, and the reward function provides dense information about
how to further improve the generation quality and correctness. However, in the
hardest instances of important problems, two problems arise: (1) the base
generative model attains a near-zero reward signal, and (2) calls to the reward
oracle are expensive. This setting poses a fundamentally different learning
challenge than standard reward-based post-training. To address this, we propose
BaNEL (Bayesian Negative Evidence Learning), an algorithm that post-trains the
model using failed attempts only, while minimizing the number of reward
evaluations (NREs). Our method is based on the idea that the problem of
learning regularities underlying failures can be cast as another, in-loop
generative modeling problem. We then leverage this model to assess whether new
data resembles previously seen failures and steer the generation away from
them. We show that BaNEL can improve model performance without observing a
single successful sample on several sparse-reward tasks, outperforming existing
novelty-bonus approaches by up to several orders of magnitude in success rate,
while using fewer reward evaluations.

Conclusion: HINT框架通过提升训练亲和力有效解决了RL训练中的奖励稀疏问题，在保持模型自主推理能力的同时显著提升了训练效率和性能。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has become a key driver for enhancing the long
chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs).
However, prevalent methods like GRPO often fail when task difficulty exceeds
the model's capacity, leading to reward sparsity and inefficient training.
While prior work attempts to mitigate this using off-policy data, such as
mixing RL with Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) or using hints, they often misguide
policy updates In this work, we identify a core issue underlying these
failures, which we term low training affinity. This condition arises from a
large distributional mismatch between external guidance and the model's policy.
To diagnose this, we introduce Affinity, the first quantitative metric for
monitoring exploration efficiency and training stability. To improve Affinity,
we propose HINT: Helping Ineffective rollouts Navigate Towards effectiveness,
an adaptive hinting framework. Instead of providing direct answers, HINT
supplies heuristic hints that guide the model to discover solutions on its own,
preserving its autonomous reasoning capabilities. Extensive experiments on
mathematical reasoning tasks show that HINT consistently outperforms existing
methods, achieving state-of-the-art results with models of various scales,
while also demonstrating significantly more stable learning and greater data
efficiency.Code is available on Github.

Abstract: Radio frequency fingerprint identification (RFFI) is a critical technique for
wireless network security, leveraging intrinsic hardware-level imperfections
introduced during device manufacturing to enable precise transmitter
identification. While deep neural networks have shown remarkable capability in
extracting discriminative features, their real-world deployment is hindered by
receiver-induced variability. In practice, RF fingerprint signals comprise
transmitter-specific features as well as channel distortions and
receiver-induced biases. Although channel equalization can mitigate channel
noise, receiver-induced feature shifts remain largely unaddressed, causing the
RFFI models to overfit to receiver-specific patterns. This limitation is
particularly problematic when training and evaluation share the same receiver,
as replacing the receiver in deployment can cause substantial performance
degradation. To tackle this challenge, we propose an RFFI framework robust to
cross-receiver variability, integrating adversarial training and style transfer
to explicitly disentangle transmitter and receiver features. By enforcing
domain-invariant representation learning, our method isolates genuine hardware
signatures from receiver artifacts, ensuring robustness against receiver
changes. Extensive experiments on multi-receiver datasets demonstrate that our
approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving up to a
10% improvement in average accuracy across diverse receiver settings.

*Disharee Bhowmick,Ranjith Ramanathan,Sathyanarayanan N. Aakur*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: STaTS是一个轻量级的无监督框架，用于结构感知的时间序列摘要化，通过自适应压缩时间序列为紧凑的标记序列，实现高达30倍的序列压缩同时保留核心时间动态。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型通常处理原始或固定窗口序列，将所有时间步视为同等信息量，导致长序列或噪声序列中的效率低下、鲁棒性差和可扩展性有限。时间序列数据包含的潜在时间结构、局部平稳状态转换、重复模式和变异性爆发很少在标准表示学习流程中被利用。

Method: STaTS使用基于BIC的统计差异准则在多个时间分辨率上检测变化点，然后使用简单函数（如均值）或生成模型（如GMM）总结每个段。该方法作为模型无关的预处理器，可与现有无监督时间序列编码器集成而无需重新训练。

Result: 在150多个数据集上的广泛实验表明，STaTS能够实现完整模型性能的85-90%，同时显著降低计算成本。在UCR-85、UCR-128和UEA-30档案的分类任务，以及ETTh1、ETTh2、ETTm1和Electricity的预测任务中均表现出色。STaTS在噪声下提高了鲁棒性，并保留了判别结构，优于均匀和基于聚类的压缩基线。

Conclusion: STaTS作为一个原则性的通用解决方案，为高效、结构感知的时间序列建模提供了有效方法，在保持性能的同时大幅降低了计算复杂度。

Abstract: Time series data often contain latent temporal structure, transitions between
locally stationary regimes, repeated motifs, and bursts of variability, that
are rarely leveraged in standard representation learning pipelines. Existing
models typically operate on raw or fixed-window sequences, treating all time
steps as equally informative, which leads to inefficiencies, poor robustness,
and limited scalability in long or noisy sequences. We propose STaTS, a
lightweight, unsupervised framework for Structure-Aware Temporal Summarization
that adaptively compresses both univariate and multivariate time series into
compact, information-preserving token sequences. STaTS detects change points
across multiple temporal resolutions using a BIC-based statistical divergence
criterion, then summarizes each segment using simple functions like the mean or
generative models such as GMMs. This process achieves up to 30x sequence
compression while retaining core temporal dynamics. STaTS operates as a
model-agnostic preprocessor and can be integrated with existing unsupervised
time series encoders without retraining. Extensive experiments on 150+
datasets, including classification tasks on the UCR-85, UCR-128, and UEA-30
archives, and forecasting on ETTh1 and ETTh2, ETTm1, and Electricity,
demonstrate that STaTS enables 85-90\% of the full-model performance while
offering dramatic reductions in computational cost. Moreover, STaTS improves
robustness under noise and preserves discriminative structure, outperforming
uniform and clustering-based compression baselines. These results position
STaTS as a principled, general-purpose solution for efficient, structure-aware
time series modeling.

Motivation: 针对时序图学习基准结果可靠性问题，研究模型实际利用哪些图属性进行预测，以解决评估协议问题和简单启发式方法竞争力带来的困惑。

Method: 在合成和真实数据集上系统评估7个模型对8个基本时序图属性的学习能力，包括结构特征、时序模式和边形成机制等。

Conclusion: 研究结果为时序图学习模型的实际应用提供了实用见解，并推动了时序图学习中更注重可解释性的评估方法。

Abstract: Learning on temporal graphs has become a central topic in graph
representation learning, with numerous benchmarks indicating the strong
performance of state-of-the-art models. However, recent work has raised
concerns about the reliability of benchmark results, noting issues with
commonly used evaluation protocols and the surprising competitiveness of simple
heuristics. This contrast raises the question of which properties of the
underlying graphs temporal graph learning models actually use to form their
predictions. We address this by systematically evaluating seven models on their
ability to capture eight fundamental attributes related to the link structure
of temporal graphs. These include structural characteristics such as density,
temporal patterns such as recency, and edge formation mechanisms such as
homophily. Using both synthetic and real-world datasets, we analyze how well
models learn these attributes. Our findings reveal a mixed picture: models
capture some attributes well but fail to reproduce others. With this, we expose
important limitations. Overall, we believe that our results provide practical
insights for the application of temporal graph learning models, and motivate
more interpretability-driven evaluations in temporal graph learning research.

### [260] [Weight Initialization and Variance Dynamics in Deep Neural Networks and Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09423)

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文通过理论分析和实验验证，研究了ReLU多层感知机和GPT-2风格transformer的权重初始化策略，发现1e-2到1e-1的标准差范围提供稳定训练，Kaiming初始化优于Xavier，并在transformer中观察到层间方差均衡现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 权重初始化对训练初期的信号传播和梯度流动至关重要，需要系统研究不同初始化策略在深度网络中的表现，为现代transformer架构提供实用的初始化指导。

Method: 采用对数扫描初始标准差的方法，在ReLU多层感知机和12层GPT-2风格transformer上进行对比实验，跟踪层间权重方差变化。

Result: 发现1e-2到1e-1的标准差范围形成稳定训练带；Kaiming初始化比Xavier收敛更快更稳定；transformer浅层权重方差快速扩张，深层变化较缓，最终均衡到窄带内。

Conclusion: 研究连接了经典初始化原理与现代transformer行为，为鲁棒训练提供了简单实用的初始化方案。

Abstract: Weight initialization governs signal propagation and gradient flow at the
start of training. This paper offers a theory-grounded and empirically
validated study across two regimes: compact ReLU multilayer perceptrons and
GPT-2-style transformers. First, a logarithmic sweep of the initial standard
deviation maps vanishing and exploding regimes and identifies a broad stability
band with standard deviations between 1e-2 and 1e-1. Second, a controlled
comparison shows that Kaiming (fan-in) initialization converges faster and more
stably than Xavier under ReLU, consistent with variance-preserving theory.
Third, in a from-scratch 12-layer GPT-2-style model, this paper tracks
layerwise Q/K/V weight variance through pretraining and observe depth-dependent
equilibration into narrow bands: shallow layers expand rapidly while deeper
layers change more gradually. Together, these results connect classic
initialization principles with modern transformer behavior and yield simple,
practical recipes for robust training.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文证明了均匀缩放流（USFs）在理论上连接了深度单类分类和密度估计两种异常检测范式，通过最大似然训练USFs等价于Deep SVDD目标，并提出了将USFs作为非USFs的替代方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前无监督异常检测存在深度单类分类和密度估计两种主要范式，但两者之间的理论联系尚未明确。本文旨在通过均匀缩放流（USFs）建立这两种方法的理论桥梁。

Method: 提出均匀缩放流（USFs）作为连接两种范式的理论工具，证明USFs的最大似然训练等价于Deep SVDD目标，并展示了如何将USFs作为现代异常检测架构中非USFs的替代方案。

Result: 实验表明，在多个基准测试和模型骨干网络上，用USFs替代非USFs能够带来一致的性能提升和显著改善的训练稳定性，适用于图像级和像素级检测任务。

Conclusion: USFs成功统一了两种主要的异常检测范式，不仅推进了理论理解，还提升了实际性能，建议将USFs作为现代异常检测架构的标准组件。

Abstract: Unsupervised anomaly detection is often framed around two widely studied
paradigms. Deep one-class classification, exemplified by Deep SVDD, learns
compact latent representations of normality, while density estimators realized
by normalizing flows directly model the likelihood of nominal data. In this
work, we show that uniformly scaling flows (USFs), normalizing flows with a
constant Jacobian determinant, precisely connect these approaches.
Specifically, we prove how training a USF via maximum-likelihood reduces to a
Deep SVDD objective with a unique regularization that inherently prevents
representational collapse. This theoretical bridge implies that USFs inherit
both the density faithfulness of flows and the distance-based reasoning of
one-class methods. We further demonstrate that USFs induce a tighter alignment
between negative log-likelihood and latent norm than either Deep SVDD or
non-USFs, and how recent hybrid approaches combining one-class objectives with
VAEs can be naturally extended to USFs. Consequently, we advocate using USFs as
a drop-in replacement for non-USFs in modern anomaly detection architectures.
Empirically, this substitution yields consistent performance gains and
substantially improved training stability across multiple benchmarks and model
backbones for both image-level and pixel-level detection. These results unify
two major anomaly detection paradigms, advancing both theoretical understanding
and practical performance.

Abstract: This study develops an interpretable machine learning framework to forecast
startup outcomes, including funding, patenting, and exit. A firm-quarter panel
for 2010-2023 is constructed from Crunchbase and matched to U.S. Patent and
Trademark Office (USPTO) data. Three horizons are evaluated: next funding
within 12 months, patent-stock growth within 24 months, and exit through an
initial public offering (IPO) or acquisition within 36 months. Preprocessing is
fit on a development window (2010-2019) and applied without change to later
cohorts to avoid leakage. Class imbalance is addressed using inverse-prevalence
weights and the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique for Nominal and
Continuous features (SMOTE-NC). Logistic regression and tree ensembles,
including Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost, are compared using
the area under the precision-recall curve (PR-AUC) and the area under the
receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC). Patent, funding, and exit
predictions achieve AUROC values of 0.921, 0.817, and 0.872, providing
transparent and reproducible rankings for innovation finance.

Abstract: Latent manifolds of autoencoders provide low-dimensional representations of
data, which can be studied from a geometric perspective. We propose to describe
these latent manifolds as implicit submanifolds of some ambient latent space.
Based on this, we develop tools for a discrete Riemannian calculus
approximating classical geometric operators. These tools are robust against
inaccuracies of the implicit representation often occurring in practical
examples. To obtain a suitable implicit representation, we propose to learn an
approximate projection onto the latent manifold by minimizing a denoising
objective. This approach is independent of the underlying autoencoder and
supports the use of different Riemannian geometries on the latent manifolds.
The framework in particular enables the computation of geodesic paths
connecting given end points and shooting geodesics via the Riemannian
exponential maps on latent manifolds. We evaluate our approach on various
autoencoders trained on synthetic and real data.

Conclusion: CRPS-LAM是概率性区域天气预报的有效方法，在保持准确性的同时显著提高了计算效率。

Abstract: Machine learning for weather prediction increasingly relies on ensemble
methods to provide probabilistic forecasts. Diffusion-based models have shown
strong performance in Limited-Area Modeling (LAM) but remain computationally
expensive at sampling time. Building on the success of global weather
forecasting models trained based on Continuous Ranked Probability Score (CRPS),
we introduce CRPS-LAM, a probabilistic LAM forecasting model trained with a
CRPS-based objective. By sampling and injecting a single latent noise vector
into the model, CRPS-LAM generates ensemble members in a single forward pass,
achieving sampling speeds up to 39 times faster than a diffusion-based model.
We evaluate the model on the MEPS regional dataset, where CRPS-LAM matches the
low errors of diffusion models. By retaining also fine-scale forecast details,
the method stands out as an effective approach for probabilistic regional
weather forecasting

Conclusion: MB-AIL算法在理论和实践上都证明了其优越性，为在线对抗模仿学习提供了有效的解决方案，特别是在样本效率和方差缩放方面表现突出。

Abstract: We study online adversarial imitation learning (AIL), where an agent learns
from offline expert demonstrations and interacts with the environment online
without access to rewards. Despite strong empirical results, the benefits of
online interaction and the impact of stochasticity remain poorly understood. We
address these gaps by introducing a model-based AIL algorithm (MB-AIL) and
establish its horizon-free, second-order sample-complexity guarantees under
general function approximations for both expert data and reward-free
interactions. These second-order bounds provide an instance-dependent result
that can scale with the variance of returns under the relevant policies and
therefore tighten as the system approaches determinism. Together with
second-order, information-theoretic lower bounds on a newly constructed
hard-instance family, we show that MB-AIL attains minimax-optimal sample
complexity for online interaction (up to logarithmic factors) with limited
expert demonstrations and matches the lower bound for expert demonstrations in
terms of the dependence on horizon $H$, precision $\epsilon$ and the policy
variance $\sigma^2$. Experiments further validate our theoretical findings and
demonstrate that a practical implementation of MB-AIL matches or surpasses the
sample efficiency of existing methods.

Motivation: 现有的物理模型和数据驱动模型由于环境生态系统的数据异质性，难以泛化到不同空间区域和尺度，且训练样本有限进一步加剧了这个问题。

Method: 提出地理感知嵌入技术，利用地理信息显式捕获跨空间区域和尺度的共享原理和模式，并将其集成到门控时空图神经网络中。

Result: 在跨越37年、覆盖美国东海岸多个流域的真实数据集上，Geo-STARS在跨区域和跨尺度的泛化性能优于最先进的基线方法。

Conclusion: Geo-STARS展示了在可扩展、数据高效的环境监测和决策制定方面的潜力。

Abstract: Understanding environmental ecosystems is vital for the sustainable
management of our planet. However,existing physics-based and data-driven models
often fail to generalize to varying spatial regions and scales due to the
inherent data heterogeneity presented in real environmental ecosystems. This
generalization issue is further exacerbated by the limited observation samples
available for model training. To address these issues, we propose Geo-STARS, a
geo-aware spatio-temporal modeling framework for predicting stream water
temperature across different watersheds and spatial scales. The major
innovation of Geo-STARS is the introduction of geo-aware embedding, which
leverages geographic information to explicitly capture shared principles and
patterns across spatial regions and scales. We further integrate the geo-aware
embedding into a gated spatio-temporal graph neural network. This design
enables the model to learn complex spatial and temporal patterns guided by
geographic and hydrological context, even with sparse or no observational data.
We evaluate Geo-STARS's efficacy in predicting stream water temperature, which
is a master factor for water quality. Using real-world datasets spanning 37
years across multiple watersheds along the eastern coast of the United States,
Geo-STARS demonstrates its superior generalization performance across both
regions and scales, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines. These results
highlight the promise of Geo-STARS for scalable, data-efficient environmental
monitoring and decision-making.

sequences, as well as image and time-series -- benchmarks, demonstrate PETRA's
ability to improve neural model performance and scalability -- namely, a
significant decrease in model size (up to 75%) and latency (up to 33%), and an
increase in throughput (by 13%) without noticeable degradation in the target

<details>

Motivation: 生命科学中的动态系统通常包含重叠行为模式的复杂混合，传统基于流的建模技术假设局部平滑动态，难以处理这些模式间的噪声和不规则转换。

Method: MODE是一个图建模框架，使用神经门控机制将复杂动态分解为稀疏可解释组件，允许智能体跳转到不同的控制规律，特别适合处理噪声转换。

Result: 在合成和真实计算生物学数据集上的评估显示，MODE在无监督分类任务中表现优异，能够成功预测细胞生物学中的关键循环和分支过程，并在单细胞RNA测序数据中区分增殖和分化动态，预测细胞命运承诺时间。

Conclusion: MODE框架能够有效处理复杂动态系统中的行为模式转换问题，为计算生物学中的关键挑战提供了解决方案。

Abstract: Dynamical systems in the life sciences are often composed of complex mixtures
of overlapping behavioral regimes. Cellular subpopulations may shift from
cycling to equilibrium dynamics or branch towards different developmental
fates. The transitions between these regimes can appear noisy and irregular,
posing a serious challenge to traditional, flow-based modeling techniques which
assume locally smooth dynamics. To address this challenge, we propose MODE
(Mixture Of Dynamical Experts), a graphical modeling framework whose neural
gating mechanism decomposes complex dynamics into sparse, interpretable
components, enabling both the unsupervised discovery of behavioral regimes and
accurate long-term forecasting across regime transitions. Crucially, because
agents in our framework can jump to different governing laws, MODE is
especially tailored to the aforementioned noisy transitions. We evaluate our
method on a battery of synthetic and real datasets from computational biology.
First, we systematically benchmark MODE on an unsupervised classification task
using synthetic dynamical snapshot data, including in noisy, few-sample
settings. Next, we show how MODE succeeds on challenging forecasting tasks
which simulate key cycling and branching processes in cell biology. Finally, we
deploy our method on human, single-cell RNA sequencing data and show that it
can not only distinguish proliferation from differentiation dynamics but also
predict when cells will commit to their ultimate fate, a key outstanding
challenge in computational biology.
