### [1] [Hybrid Deep Learning for Hyperspectral Single Image Super-Resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00033)
*Usman Muhammad,Jorma Laaksonen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出SSUF模块和空间-光谱梯度损失函数，用于提升高光谱单图像超分辨率任务的空间细节和光谱保真度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统深度学习模型在高光谱超分辨率任务中难以同时恢复精细空间细节和保持宽波长范围的光谱保真度。

Method: 提出可集成到标准2D卷积架构的SSUF模块，结合光谱解混和光谱-空间特征提取，并设计包含空间和光谱梯度分量的自定义损失函数。

Result: 在三个公共遥感高光谱数据集上的实验表明，该混合深度学习模型在降低模型复杂度的同时实现了有竞争力的性能。

Conclusion: SSUF模块和空间-光谱梯度损失函数能有效提升高光谱超分辨率任务的空间和光谱重建质量。

Abstract: Hyperspectral single image super-resolution (SISR) is a challenging task due
to the difficulty of restoring fine spatial details while preserving spectral
fidelity across a wide range of wavelengths, which limits the performance of
conventional deep learning models. To address this challenge, we introduce
Spectral-Spatial Unmixing Fusion (SSUF), a novel module that can be seamlessly
integrated into standard 2D convolutional architectures to enhance both spatial
resolution and spectral integrity. The SSUF combines spectral unmixing with
spectral--spatial feature extraction and guides a ResNet-based convolutional
neural network for improved reconstruction. In addition, we propose a custom
Spatial-Spectral Gradient Loss function that integrates mean squared error with
spatial and spectral gradient components, encouraging accurate reconstruction
of both spatial and spectral features. Experiments on three public remote
sensing hyperspectral datasets demonstrate that the proposed hybrid deep
learning model achieves competitive performance while reducing model
complexity.

### [2] [Review of Hallucination Understanding in Large Language and Vision Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00034)
*Zhengyi Ho,Siyuan Liang,Dacheng Tao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个统一的多层次框架来表征图像和文本幻觉，通过任务-模态交织方法将幻觉与模型生命周期中的特定机制联系起来，揭示了幻觉源于数据分布和继承偏见的可预测模式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言和视觉模型在现实应用中的广泛采用使得解决幻觉问题变得迫切，因为幻觉会产生错误输出并传播错误信息，造成财务和运营损失。当前对幻觉的理解仍不完整和碎片化，需要统一框架来理解根本原因。

Method: 提出了统一的多层次框架来表征图像和文本幻觉，采用任务-模态交织方法将幻觉与模型生命周期中的特定机制联系起来。

Result: 研究发现幻觉往往源于数据分布中的可预测模式和继承的偏见，这为理解幻觉提供了更深入的洞察。

Conclusion: 通过深化对幻觉的理解，这项研究为开发更鲁棒有效的解决方案奠定了基础，有助于在现实世界生成式AI系统中更好地应对幻觉问题。

Abstract: The widespread adoption of large language and vision models in real-world
applications has made urgent the need to address hallucinations -- instances
where models produce incorrect or nonsensical outputs. These errors can
propagate misinformation during deployment, leading to both financial and
operational harm. Although much research has been devoted to mitigating
hallucinations, our understanding of it is still incomplete and fragmented.
Without a coherent understanding of hallucinations, proposed solutions risk
mitigating surface symptoms rather than underlying causes, limiting their
effectiveness and generalizability in deployment. To tackle this gap, we first
present a unified, multi-level framework for characterizing both image and text
hallucinations across diverse applications, aiming to reduce conceptual
fragmentation. We then link these hallucinations to specific mechanisms within
a model's lifecycle, using a task-modality interleaved approach to promote a
more integrated understanding. Our investigations reveal that hallucinations
often stem from predictable patterns in data distributions and inherited
biases. By deepening our understanding, this survey provides a foundation for
developing more robust and effective solutions to hallucinations in real-world
generative AI systems.

### [3] [On Robustness of Vision-Language-Action Model against Multi-Modal Perturbations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00037)
*Jianing Guo,Zhenhong Wu,Chang Tu,Yiyao Ma,Xiangqi Kong,Zhiqian Liu,Jiaming Ji,Shuning Zhang,Yuanpei Chen,Kai Chen,Xianglong Liu,Qi Dou,Yaodong Yang,Huijie Zhao,Weifeng Lv,Simin Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了RobustVLA方法，通过对抗训练和多臂老虎机算法提升视觉-语言-动作模型在多模态扰动下的鲁棒性，在17种扰动下显著优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VLA模型主要针对简单的视觉扰动，忽视了动作、指令、环境和观察等多模态扰动，需要开发全面的鲁棒性方法。

Method: 采用离线鲁棒优化对抗最坏情况动作噪声，通过多臂老虎机算法自动识别最有害的噪声，确保输入变化时动作的一致性。

Result: 在LIBERO基准上，RobustVLA相比基线在17种扰动下获得12.6%的绝对提升，推理速度比现有视觉鲁棒VLA快50.6倍，在真实FR5机器人上获得65.6%的绝对增益。

Conclusion: RobustVLA有效提升了VLA模型在多模态扰动下的鲁棒性，特别是在真实机器人场景中表现突出，为VLA的实际部署提供了可靠解决方案。

Abstract: In Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, robustness to real-world
perturbations is critical for deployment. Existing methods target simple visual
disturbances, overlooking the broader multi-modal perturbations that arise in
actions, instructions, environments, and observations. Here, we first evaluate
the robustness of mainstream VLAs under 17 perturbations across four
modalities. We find (1) actions as the most fragile modality, (2) Existing
visual-robust VLA do not gain robustness in other modality, and (3) pi0
demonstrates superior robustness with a diffusion-based action head. To build
multi-modal robust VLAs, we propose RobustVLA against perturbations in VLA
inputs and outputs. For output robustness, we perform offline robust
optimization against worst-case action noise that maximizes mismatch in flow
matching objective. This can be seen as adversarial training, label smoothing,
and outlier penalization. For input robustness, we enforce consistent actions
across input variations that preserve task semantics. To account for multiple
perturbations, we formulate robustness as a multi-armed bandit problem and
apply an upper confidence bound algorithm to automatically identify the most
harmful noise. Experiments on LIBERO demonstrate our RobustVLA delivers
absolute gains over baselines of 12.6% on the pi0 backbone and 10.4% on the
OpenVLA backbone across all 17 perturbations, achieving 50.6x faster inference
than existing visual-robust VLAs, and a 10.4% gain under mixed perturbations.
Our RobustVLA is particularly effective on real-world FR5 robot with limited
demonstrations, showing absolute gains by 65.6% under perturbations of four
modalities.

### [4] [Uncovering Intrinsic Capabilities: A Paradigm for Data Curation in Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00040)
*Junjie Li,Ziao Wang,Jianghong Ma,Xiaofeng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CADC框架通过无监督发现模型内在能力，基于梯度学习轨迹和影响力估计来筛选训练数据，仅需5%原始数据就能超越全数据训练效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统指令调优方法将模型视为黑盒，忽视其潜在学习能力，导致数据预算减少时性能下降。需要从任务特定启发式转向内在能力分析。

Method: 无监督发现内在能力，通过梯度学习轨迹分析；基于影响力估计将训练数据归因到具体能力；通过平衡选择和分阶段排序构建能力感知课程。

Result: 仅使用5%原始数据，在多项多模态基准测试中超越了全数据训练的效果。

Conclusion: 内在能力是模型学习的基本构建模块，CADC为指令数据筛选建立了原则性范式。

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) achieve strong benchmark performance, but
controlling their behavior through instruction tuning remains difficult.
Reducing the budget of instruction tuning dataset often causes regressions, as
heuristic strategies treat models as black boxes and overlook the latent
capabilities that govern learning. We introduce Capability-Attributed Data
Curation (CADC), a framework that shifts curation from task-specific heuristics
to intrinsic capability analysis. CADC discovers intrinsic capabilities in an
unsupervised manner from gradient-based learning trajectories, attributes
training data to these capabilities via influence estimation, and curates
capability-aware curricula through balanced selection and staged sequencing.
This transforms black-box instruction tuning into a controllable,
capability-driven process. With as little as 5% of the original data, CADC
surpasses full-data training on multimodal benchmarks. These results validate
intrinsic capabilities as the fundamental building blocks of model learning and
establish CADC as a principle paradigm for instruction data curation.

### [5] [Culture In a Frame: C$^3$B as a Comic-Based Benchmark for Multimodal Culturally Awareness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00041)
*Yuchen Song,Andong Chen,Wenxin Zhu,Kehai Chen,Xuefeng Bai,Muyun Yang,Tiejun Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了C³B基准测试，这是一个多文化、多任务、多语言的文化意识能力评估基准，包含2000多张图像和18000多个QA对，旨在评估多模态大语言模型的文化意识能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基准测试在任务设计上缺乏渐进难度，缺少跨语言任务，且使用的真实世界图像通常只包含单一文化，使得测试相对容易。

Method: 构建了包含三个难度递增任务的基准：从基础视觉识别到高级文化冲突理解，再到文化内容生成，涵盖多种文化和语言。

Result: 对11个开源MLLM的评估显示，模型性能与人类表现存在显著差距，表明C³B对当前MLLM构成重大挑战。

Conclusion: C³B基准测试揭示了当前MLLM在文化意识能力方面的不足，鼓励未来研究提升MLLM的文化意识能力。

Abstract: Cultural awareness capabilities has emerged as a critical capability for
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). However, current benchmarks lack
progressed difficulty in their task design and are deficient in cross-lingual
tasks. Moreover, current benchmarks often use real-world images. Each
real-world image typically contains one culture, making these benchmarks
relatively easy for MLLMs. Based on this, we propose C$^3$B ($\textbf{C}$omics
$\textbf{C}$ross-$\textbf{C}$ultural $\textbf{B}$enchmark), a novel
multicultural, multitask and multilingual cultural awareness capabilities
benchmark. C$^3$B comprises over 2000 images and over 18000 QA pairs,
constructed on three tasks with progressed difficulties, from basic visual
recognition to higher-level cultural conflict understanding, and finally to
cultural content generation. We conducted evaluations on 11 open-source MLLMs,
revealing a significant performance gap between MLLMs and human performance.
The gap demonstrates that C$^3$B poses substantial challenges for current
MLLMs, encouraging future research to advance the cultural awareness
capabilities of MLLMs.

### [6] [Beyond the Prompt: Gender Bias in Text-to-Image Models, with a Case Study on Hospital Professions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00045)
*Franck Vandewiele,Remi Synave,Samuel Delepoulle,Remi Cozot*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文研究了6个最先进的开源文本到图像模型中的性别偏见问题，发现在医院相关职业的描绘中存在系统性职业刻板印象，不同模型表现出不同的性别偏见模式，提示词措辞对结果有重要影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文本到图像模型在专业、教育和创意环境中应用日益广泛，但其输出经常嵌入和放大社会偏见，特别是性别偏见。研究旨在系统评估这些模型在职业描绘中的性别表征问题。

Method: 使用6个开源模型（HunyuanImage 2.1、HiDream-I1-dev、Qwen-Image、FLUX.1-dev、Stable-Diffusion 3.5 Large、Stable-Diffusion-XL），为5个医院相关职业（心脏病专家、医院主任、护士、护理人员、外科医生）和5种肖像修饰词组合生成图像，每个组合100张。

Result: 所有模型都表现出系统性职业刻板印象：护士被描绘为女性，外科医生主要为男性。不同模型差异显著：Qwen-Image和SDXL强化男性主导，HiDream-I1-dev结果混合，FLUX.1-dev在多数角色中偏向女性。提示词修饰语也影响性别平衡，如"corporate"强化男性描绘，"beautiful"偏向女性描绘。

Conclusion: 文本到图像模型中的性别偏见既系统化又模型特定，提示词措辞在塑造人口统计结果中起关键作用。研究强调需要偏见感知设计、平衡默认设置和用户指导，以防止生成式AI强化职业刻板印象。

Abstract: Text-to-image (TTI) models are increasingly used in professional,
educational, and creative contexts, yet their outputs often embed and amplify
social biases. This paper investigates gender representation in six
state-of-the-art open-weight models: HunyuanImage 2.1, HiDream-I1-dev,
Qwen-Image, FLUX.1-dev, Stable-Diffusion 3.5 Large, and Stable-Diffusion-XL.
Using carefully designed prompts, we generated 100 images for each combination
of five hospital-related professions (cardiologist, hospital director, nurse,
paramedic, surgeon) and five portrait qualifiers ("", corporate, neutral,
aesthetic, beautiful).
  Our analysis reveals systematic occupational stereotypes: all models produced
nurses exclusively as women and surgeons predominantly as men. However,
differences emerge across models: Qwen-Image and SDXL enforce rigid male
dominance, HiDream-I1-dev shows mixed outcomes, and FLUX.1-dev skews female in
most roles. HunyuanImage 2.1 and Stable-Diffusion 3.5 Large also reproduce
gender stereotypes but with varying degrees of sensitivity to prompt
formulation. Portrait qualifiers further modulate gender balance, with terms
like corporate reinforcing male depictions and beautiful favoring female ones.
Sensitivity varies widely: Qwen-Image remains nearly unaffected, while
FLUX.1-dev, SDXL, and SD3.5 show strong prompt dependence.
  These findings demonstrate that gender bias in TTI models is both systematic
and model-specific. Beyond documenting disparities, we argue that prompt
wording plays a critical role in shaping demographic outcomes. The results
underscore the need for bias-aware design, balanced defaults, and user guidance
to prevent the reinforcement of occupational stereotypes in generative AI.

### [7] [Reinforcement Learning-Based Prompt Template Stealing for Text-to-Image Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00046)
*Xiaotian Zou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RLStealer是一个基于强化学习的提示词窃取框架，能够通过少量示例图像恢复文本到图像模型的提示模板，攻击成本仅为现有基线的13%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型催生了提示词交易市场，但提示词本身存在被窃取的安全风险，本文旨在揭示这种漏洞。

Method: 将模板窃取建模为序列决策问题，使用基于相似度的反馈信号作为奖励函数，通过强化学习有效探索提示空间。

Result: 在公开基准测试中达到最先进性能，攻击成本大幅降低，且能有效泛化到不同图像风格窃取未见过的提示模板。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了提示词交易中紧迫的安全威胁，为新兴MLLMs市场制定保护标准奠定了基础。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have transformed text-to-image
workflows, allowing designers to create novel visual concepts with
unprecedented speed. This progress has given rise to a thriving prompt trading
market, where curated prompts that induce trademark styles are bought and sold.
Although commercially attractive, prompt trading also introduces a largely
unexamined security risk: the prompts themselves can be stolen.
  In this paper, we expose this vulnerability and present RLStealer, a
reinforcement learning based prompt inversion framework that recovers its
template from only a small set of example images. RLStealer treats template
stealing as a sequential decision making problem and employs multiple
similarity based feedback signals as reward functions to effectively explore
the prompt space. Comprehensive experiments on publicly available benchmarks
demonstrate that RLStealer gets state-of-the-art performance while reducing the
total attack cost to under 13% of that required by existing baselines. Our
further analysis confirms that RLStealer can effectively generalize across
different image styles to efficiently steal unseen prompt templates. Our study
highlights an urgent security threat inherent in prompt trading and lays the
groundwork for developing protective standards in the emerging MLLMs
marketplace.

### [8] [Explanation-Driven Counterfactual Testing for Faithfulness in Vision-Language Model Explanations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00047)
*Sihao Ding,Santosh Vasa,Aditi Ramadwar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出EDCT方法，通过将视觉语言模型的自然语言解释作为可证伪假设，自动生成反事实图像来验证解释的忠实性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型产生的解释听起来合理但可能不反映真实的因果因素，这种可信度与忠实性不匹配存在技术和治理风险。

Method: EDCT方法：获取模型答案和解释→解析解释为可测试视觉概念→通过生成修复生成针对性反事实编辑→使用LLM辅助分析计算反事实一致性分数。

Result: 在120个OK-VQA示例和多个VLM上测试，EDCT揭示了显著的忠实性差距，并提供了监管对齐的审计证据。

Conclusion: EDCT能够有效识别视觉语言模型解释中的忠实性问题，为模型可信度评估提供自动化验证工具。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) often produce fluent Natural Language
Explanations (NLEs) that sound convincing but may not reflect the causal
factors driving predictions. This mismatch of plausibility and faithfulness
poses technical and governance risks. We introduce Explanation-Driven
Counterfactual Testing (EDCT), a fully automated verification procedure for a
target VLM that treats the model's own explanation as a falsifiable hypothesis.
Given an image-question pair, EDCT: (1) obtains the model's answer and NLE, (2)
parses the NLE into testable visual concepts, (3) generates targeted
counterfactual edits via generative inpainting, and (4) computes a
Counterfactual Consistency Score (CCS) using LLM-assisted analysis of changes
in both answers and explanations. Across 120 curated OK-VQA examples and
multiple VLMs, EDCT uncovers substantial faithfulness gaps and provides
regulator-aligned audit artifacts indicating when cited concepts fail causal
tests.

### [9] [Intuitions of Machine Learning Researchers about Transfer Learning for Medical Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00902)
*Yucheng Lu,Hubert Dariusz Zając,Veronika Cheplygina,Amelia Jiménez-Sánchez*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究通过任务型调查探讨了医学影像迁移学习中源数据集选择的人类决策过程，发现选择受任务依赖性、社区实践、数据集特性和相似性感知影响，但相似性评分与预期性能并不总是一致。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前医学影像迁移学习的源数据集选择主要依赖研究者直觉而非系统原则，这会影响算法的泛化能力和患者预后。

Method: 采用以人为中心的HCI视角，通过任务型调查收集机器学习从业者的源数据集选择决策过程。

Result: 发现选择决策是任务依赖性的，受社区实践、数据集特性和计算/感知相似性影响，但相似性评分与预期性能并不总是一致，挑战了传统"越相似越好"的观点。

Conclusion: 需要更清晰的定义和HCI工具来明确这些启发式方法，为迁移学习中更系统的源选择提供实用见解。

Abstract: Transfer learning is crucial for medical imaging, yet the selection of source
datasets - which can impact the generalizability of algorithms, and thus
patient outcomes - often relies on researchers' intuition rather than
systematic principles. This study investigates these decisions through a
task-based survey with machine learning practitioners. Unlike prior work that
benchmarks models and experimental setups, we take a human-centered HCI
perspective on how practitioners select source datasets. Our findings indicate
that choices are task-dependent and influenced by community practices, dataset
properties, and computational (data embedding), or perceived visual or semantic
similarity. However, similarity ratings and expected performance are not always
aligned, challenging a traditional "more similar is better" view. Participants
often used ambiguous terminology, which suggests a need for clearer definitions
and HCI tools to make them explicit and usable. By clarifying these heuristics,
this work provides practical insights for more systematic source selection in
transfer learning.

### [10] [HiDe: Rethinking The Zoom-IN method in High Resolution MLLMs via Hierarchical Decoupling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00054)
*Xianjie Liu,Yiman Hu,Yixiong Zou,Liang Wu,Jian Xu,Bo Zheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HiDe框架通过注意力解耦和布局保持解耦，无需训练即可提升多模态大语言模型在高分辨率图像上的性能，解决了背景干扰而非物体大小的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法认为MLLMs在高分辨率图像上表现不佳是因为物体太小，但研究发现主要问题是复杂背景干扰。

Method: 提出分层解耦框架HiDe：1）Token-wise Attention Decoupling解耦问题token识别关键信息；2）Layout-Preserving Decoupling解耦目标区域与背景，重建紧凑表示。

Result: 在V*Bench、HRBench4K和HRBench8K上达到新SOTA，Qwen2.5-VL 7B和InternVL3 8B分别达到92.1%和91.6%，超越RL方法，内存使用减少75%。

Conclusion: HiDe证明了背景干扰是高分辨率图像理解的主要瓶颈，通过解耦方法有效解决了这一问题，且无需额外训练。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have made significant strides in
visual understanding tasks. However, their performance on high-resolution
images remains suboptimal. While existing approaches often attribute this
limitation to perceptual constraints and argue that MLLMs struggle to recognize
small objects, leading them to use "zoom in" strategies for better detail, our
analysis reveals a different cause: the main issue is not object size, but
rather caused by complex background interference. We systematically analyze
this "zoom in" operation through a series of decoupling experiments and propose
the Hierarchical Decoupling Framework (HiDe), a training-free framework that
uses Token-wise Attention Decoupling (TAD) to decouple the question tokens and
identify the key information tokens, then leverages their attention weights to
achieve precise alignment with the target visual regions. Subsequently, it
employs Layout-Preserving Decoupling (LPD) to decouple these regions from the
background and reconstructs a compact representation that preserves essential
spatial layouts while eliminating background interference. HiDe sets a new SOTA
on V*Bench, HRBench4K, and HRBench8K, boosting Qwen2.5-VL 7B and InternVL3 8B
to SOTA (92.1% and 91.6% on V*Bench), even surpassing RL methods. After
optimization, HiDe uses 75% less memory than the previous training-free
approach. Code is provided in https://github.com/Tennine2077/HiDe.

### [11] [FSDENet: A Frequency and Spatial Domains based Detail Enhancement Network for Remote Sensing Semantic Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00059)
*Jiahao Fu,Yinfeng Yu,Liejun Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了FSDENet网络，通过融合空间域和频域信息来增强遥感图像分割的细节处理能力，特别针对灰度变化导致的语义边缘模糊问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决遥感图像分割中因灰度变化（如阴影和低对比度区域）导致的语义边缘模糊问题，需要充分利用空间信息并增强细节处理能力。

Method: 使用空间处理方法提取多尺度空间特征和细粒度语义细节，通过FFT整合全局和频域信息，利用Haar小波变换分解高低频特征来优化边界分割，实现空间粒度和频域边缘敏感性的双域协同。

Result: 在LoveDA、Vaihingen、Potsdam和iSAID四个广泛使用的数据集上实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: FSDENet通过空间域和频域的有效融合，显著提高了边界区域和灰度过渡带的分割精度，在多个数据集上达到了SOTA水平。

Abstract: To fully leverage spatial information for remote sensing image segmentation
and address semantic edge ambiguities caused by grayscale variations (e.g.,
shadows and low-contrast regions), we propose the Frequency and Spatial Domains
based Detail Enhancement Network (FSDENet). Our framework employs spatial
processing methods to extract rich multi-scale spatial features and
fine-grained semantic details. By effectively integrating global and
frequency-domain information through the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) in global
mappings, the model's capability to discern global representations under
grayscale variations is significantly strengthened. Additionally, we utilize
Haar wavelet transform to decompose features into high- and low-frequency
components, leveraging their distinct sensitivity to edge information to refine
boundary segmentation. The model achieves dual-domain synergy by integrating
spatial granularity with frequency-domain edge sensitivity, substantially
improving segmentation accuracy in boundary regions and grayscale transition
zones. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that FSDENet achieves
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on four widely adopted datasets: LoveDA,
Vaihingen, Potsdam, and iSAID.

*Sheng Yang,Tong Zhan,Guancheng Chen,Yanfeng Lu,Jian Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Max-V1将自动驾驶重新概念化为广义语言，将轨迹规划任务表述为下一个航点预测，通过单阶段端到端框架实现从前视摄像头输入直接预测轨迹，在nuScenes数据集上达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 重新思考自动驾驶问题，将其视为语言建模任务，利用VLM的生成能力实现端到端的轨迹预测，避免传统多阶段方法的复杂性。

Method: 提出单阶段端到端框架Max-V1，将轨迹规划视为序列生成问题，使用基于统计建模的原则性监督策略，通过模仿学习从大规模专家演示中学习复杂驾驶策略。

Result: 在nuScenes数据集上达到最先进性能，相比先前基线总体提升超过30%，在跨域数据集上表现出优异的泛化性能，展示了跨车辆鲁棒性和适应性。

Conclusion: 该工作为开发更强大的自动驾驶代理奠定了基础，展示了将自动驾驶重新概念化为语言建模任务的有效性，具有重要的实际应用潜力。

Abstract: In this work, we reconceptualize autonomous driving as a generalized language
and formulate the trajectory planning task as next waypoint prediction. We
introduce Max-V1, a novel framework for one-stage end-to-end autonomous
driving. Our framework presents a single-pass generation paradigm that aligns
with the inherent sequentiality of driving. This approach leverages the
generative capacity of the VLM (Vision-Language Model) to enable end-to-end
trajectory prediction directly from front-view camera input. The efficacy of
this method is underpinned by a principled supervision strategy derived from
statistical modeling. This provides a well-defined learning objective, which
makes the framework highly amenable to master complex driving policies through
imitation learning from large-scale expert demonstrations. Empirically, our
method achieves the state-of-the-art performance on the nuScenes dataset,
delivers an overall improvement of over 30% compared to prior baselines.
Furthermore, it exhibits superior generalization performance on cross-domain
datasets acquired from diverse vehicles, demonstrating notable potential for
cross-vehicle robustness and adaptability. Due to these empirical strengths,
this work introduces a model enabling fundamental driving behaviors, laying the
foundation for the development of more capable self-driving agents. Code will
be available upon publication.

### [13] [Efficient CNN Compression via Multi-method Low Rank Factorization and Feature Map Similarity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00062)
*M. Kokhazadeh,G. Keramidas,V. Kelefouras*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种端到端的CNN压缩设计空间探索框架，通过特征图相似性的秩选择策略、一次性微调过程和多种低秩分解技术组合，实现了高效压缩且精度损失最小。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统低秩分解方法面临秩选择困难、设计空间庞大、微调时间长、兼容性有限等问题，需要一种更高效的压缩解决方案。

Method: 基于特征图相似性的秩选择策略，一次性微调过程，支持所有卷积层和全连接层，集成6种低秩分解技术并按层选择性应用。

Result: 在14个CNN模型和8个数据集上的实验表明，该方法实现了显著压缩，精度损失最小，优于多种先进技术。

Conclusion: 提出的端到端框架解决了低秩分解的关键挑战，通过组合多种分解技术和智能秩选择，实现了高效的CNN压缩。

Abstract: Low-Rank Factorization (LRF) is a widely adopted technique for compressing
deep neural networks (DNNs). However, it faces several challenges, including
optimal rank selection, a vast design space, long fine-tuning times, and
limited compatibility with different layer types and decomposition methods.
This paper presents an end-to-end Design Space Exploration (DSE) methodology
and framework for compressing convolutional neural networks (CNNs) that
addresses all these issues. We introduce a novel rank selection strategy based
on feature map similarity, which captures non-linear interactions between layer
outputs more effectively than traditional weight-based approaches. Unlike prior
works, our method uses a one-shot fine-tuning process, significantly reducing
the overall fine-tuning time. The proposed framework is fully compatible with
all types of convolutional (Conv) and fully connected (FC) layers. To further
improve compression, the framework integrates three different LRF techniques
for Conv layers and three for FC layers, applying them selectively on a
per-layer basis. We demonstrate that combining multiple LRF methods within a
single model yields better compression results than using a single method
uniformly across all layers. Finally, we provide a comprehensive evaluation and
comparison of the six LRF techniques, offering practical insights into their
effectiveness across different scenarios. The proposed work is integrated into
TensorFlow 2.x, ensuring compatibility with widely used deep learning
workflows. Experimental results on 14 CNN models across eight datasets
demonstrate that the proposed methodology achieves substantial compression with
minimal accuracy loss, outperforming several state-of-the-art techniques.

Abstract: The evolution of the 5S methodology with the support of artificial
intelligence techniques represents a significant opportunity to improve
industrial organization audits in the automotive chain, making them more
objective, efficient and aligned with Industry 4.0 standards. This work
developed an automated 5S audit system based on large-scale language models
(LLM), capable of assessing the five senses (Seiri, Seiton, Seiso, Seiketsu,
Shitsuke) in a standardized way through intelligent image analysis. The
system's reliability was validated using Cohen's concordance coefficient (kappa
= 0.75), showing strong alignment between the automated assessments and the
corresponding human audits. The results indicate that the proposed solution
contributes significantly to continuous improvement in automotive manufacturing
environments, speeding up the audit process by 50% of the traditional time and
maintaining the consistency of the assessments, with a 99.8% reduction in
operating costs compared to traditional manual audits. The methodology
presented establishes a new paradigm for integrating lean systems with emerging
AI technologies, offering scalability for implementation in automotive plants
of different sizes.

TL;DR: 提出了OIG-Bench基准测试，用于评估多模态大语言模型在单图指南理解方面的能力，发现当前模型在语义理解和逻辑推理方面仍存在显著不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态大语言模型评估在单图指南理解方面探索不足，单图指南结合了文本、图像和符号，体现了人类感知和理解的特点，需要专门的评估基准。

Method: 开发了半自动标注流程，多个智能代理协作生成初步图像描述，辅助人工构建图像-文本对，构建了OIG-Bench基准测试。

Result: 评估了29个最先进的MLLM，Qwen2.5-VL-72B表现最佳，总体准确率为77%，但所有模型在语义理解和逻辑推理方面都存在显著弱点。

Conclusion: 当前MLLM在准确解释复杂视觉-文本关系方面仍有困难，提出的多智能体标注系统在图像描述生成方面优于所有MLLM，具有作为高质量图像描述生成器和未来数据集构建工具的潜力。

Abstract: Recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated
impressive capabilities. However, evaluating their capacity for human-like
understanding in One-Image Guides remains insufficiently explored. One-Image
Guides are a visual format combining text, imagery, and symbols to present
reorganized and structured information for easier comprehension, which are
specifically designed for human viewing and inherently embody the
characteristics of human perception and understanding. Here, we present
OIG-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark focused on One-Image Guide understanding
across diverse domains. To reduce the cost of manual annotation, we developed a
semi-automated annotation pipeline in which multiple intelligent agents
collaborate to generate preliminary image descriptions, assisting humans in
constructing image-text pairs. With OIG-Bench, we have conducted a
comprehensive evaluation of 29 state-of-the-art MLLMs, including both
proprietary and open-source models. The results show that Qwen2.5-VL-72B
performs the best among the evaluated models, with an overall accuracy of 77%.
Nevertheless, all models exhibit notable weaknesses in semantic understanding
and logical reasoning, indicating that current MLLMs still struggle to
accurately interpret complex visual-text relationships. In addition, we also
demonstrate that the proposed multi-agent annotation system outperforms all
MLLMs in image captioning, highlighting its potential as both a high-quality
image description generator and a valuable tool for future dataset
construction. Datasets are available at https://github.com/XiejcSYSU/OIG-Bench.

Abstract: We introduce Geo-R1, a reasoning-centric post-training framework that unlocks
geospatial reasoning in vision-language models by combining thinking
scaffolding and elevating. In the scaffolding stage, Geo-R1 instills a
``geospatial thinking paradigm" via supervised fine-tuning on synthetic
chain-of-thought exemplars, enabling models to connect visual cues with
geographic priors without costly human reasoning annotations. In the elevating
stage, it uses GRPO-based reinforcement learning on a weakly-supervised
cross-view pairing proxy. This design supplies a verifiable and scalable reward
signal: teaching models to capture and reconcile features across modalities,
and harnessing reasoning for accurate prediction. Geo-R1 extends geospatial
modeling from domain pretraining / supervised finetuning to reasoning-first
post-training, and achieves state-of-the-art performance across various
geospatial reasoning benchmarks. Our model is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于无偏平滑神经元(USN)指标的神经网络剪枝方法，通过移除低USN神经元并保留高USN神经元来减少过参数化，同时保持模型表达能力，在亮度对比度扰动下的鲁棒关键点检测任务中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络在视觉和机器人应用中广泛使用，需要验证其对语义变换扰动（如亮度和对比度）的鲁棒性。当前认证训练和鲁棒性认证方法面临过参数化挑战，阻碍了紧密度和可扩展性。

Abstract: Deep neural networks have been widely adopted in many vision and robotics
applications with visual inputs. It is essential to verify its robustness
against semantic transformation perturbations, such as brightness and contrast.
However, current certified training and robustness certification methods face
the challenge of over-parameterization, which hinders the tightness and
scalability due to the over-complicated neural networks. To this end, we first
analyze stability and variance of layers and neurons against input
perturbation, showing that certifiable robustness can be indicated by a
fundamental Unbiased and Smooth Neuron metric (USN). Based on USN, we introduce
a novel neural network pruning method that removes neurons with low USN and
retains those with high USN, thereby preserving model expressiveness without
over-parameterization. To further enhance this pruning process, we propose a
new Wasserstein distance loss to ensure that pruned neurons are more
concentrated across layers. We validate our approach through extensive
experiments on the challenging robust keypoint detection task, which involves
realistic brightness and contrast perturbations, demonstrating that our method
achieves superior robustness certification performance and efficiency compared
to baselines.

Abstract: Hyperspectral anomaly detection (HAD), a crucial approach for many civilian
and military applications, seeks to identify pixels with spectral signatures
that are anomalous relative to a preponderance of background signatures.
Significant effort has been made to improve HAD techniques, but challenges
arise due to complex real-world environments and, by definition, limited prior
knowledge of potential signatures of interest. This paper introduces a novel
HAD method by proposing a transport-based mathematical model to describe the
pixels comprising a given hyperspectral image. In this approach, hyperspectral
pixels are viewed as observations of a template pattern undergoing unknown
deformations that enables their representation in the signed cumulative
distribution transform (SCDT) domain. An unsupervised subspace modeling
technique is then used to construct a model of abundant background signals in
this domain, whereupon anomalous signals are detected as deviations from the
learned model. Comprehensive evaluations across five distinct datasets
illustrate the superiority of our approach compared to state-of-the-art
methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成模型能大规模生成逼真图像，引发了对检测合成图像和溯源来源的迫切需求。现有水印方法对真实失真脆弱、易被自适应移除，且密钥更新成本高。

Method: 将编码问题建模为生成模型参数的密钥依赖扰动，提出MOLM框架：使用二进制密钥激活残差和注意力块中的轻量级LoRA适配器，避免密钥特定重训练。

Result: 在Stable Diffusion和FLUX上的实验表明，MOLM在保持图像质量的同时，能鲁棒地恢复密钥，抵抗失真、压缩、再生、平均攻击和对提取器的黑盒对抗攻击。

Conclusion: MOLM框架实现了水印的不可感知性、保真度、可验证性和鲁棒性，为生成模型提供了一种有效的溯源解决方案。

Abstract: Generative models can generate photorealistic images at scale. This raises
urgent concerns about the ability to detect synthetically generated images and
attribute these images to specific sources. While watermarking has emerged as a
possible solution, existing methods remain fragile to realistic distortions,
susceptible to adaptive removal, and expensive to update when the underlying
watermarking key changes. We propose a general watermarking framework that
formulates the encoding problem as key-dependent perturbation of the parameters
of a generative model. Within this framework, we introduce Mixture of LoRA
Markers (MOLM), a routing-based instantiation in which binary keys activate
lightweight LoRA adapters inside residual and attention blocks. This design
avoids key-specific re-training and achieves the desired properties such as
imperceptibility, fidelity, verifiability, and robustness. Experiments on
Stable Diffusion and FLUX show that MOLM preserves image quality while
achieving robust key recovery against distortions, compression and
regeneration, averaging attacks, and black-box adversarial attacks on the
extractor.

Motivation: 现有开放世界检测方法存在已知和未知类别的语义混淆以及灾难性遗忘问题，导致未知召回率下降和已知类别精度退化。

Method: 提出CROWD框架，包含CROWD-Discover（使用子模条件增益函数选择与已知对象显著不同的未知实例）和CROWD-Learn（使用组合目标解耦已知和未知表示，同时保持已知类别的判别一致性）。

Result: 在OWOD基准测试中，CROWD在M-OWODB和S-OWODB上分别将已知类别精度提高了2.83%和2.05%，未知召回率比领先基线提高了近2.4倍。

Conclusion: CROWD通过组合式数据发现和表示学习方法，有效解决了开放世界检测中的语义混淆和灾难性遗忘问题，显著提升了检测性能。

Abstract: Open-World Object Detection (OWOD) enriches traditional object detectors by
enabling continual discovery and integration of unknown objects via human
guidance. However, existing OWOD approaches frequently suffer from semantic
confusion between known and unknown classes, alongside catastrophic forgetting,
leading to diminished unknown recall and degraded known-class accuracy. To
overcome these challenges, we propose Combinatorial Open-World Detection
(CROWD), a unified framework reformulating unknown object discovery and
adaptation as an interwoven combinatorial (set-based) data-discovery
(CROWD-Discover) and representation learning (CROWD-Learn) task. CROWD-Discover
strategically mines unknown instances by maximizing Submodular Conditional Gain
(SCG) functions, selecting representative examples distinctly dissimilar from
known objects. Subsequently, CROWD-Learn employs novel combinatorial objectives
that jointly disentangle known and unknown representations while maintaining
discriminative coherence among known classes, thus mitigating confusion and
forgetting. Extensive evaluations on OWOD benchmarks illustrate that CROWD
achieves improvements of 2.83% and 2.05% in known-class accuracy on M-OWODB and
S-OWODB, respectively, and nearly 2.4x unknown recall compared to leading
baselines.

Conclusion: 利用离散小波变换增强VAE潜在空间表示的方法在卫星图像处理中表现出色，为遥感应用中的潜在扩散模型提供了改进方案。

Abstract: Latent Diffusion Models (LDM), a subclass of diffusion models, mitigate the
computational complexity of pixel-space diffusion by operating within a
compressed latent space constructed by Variational Autoencoders (VAEs),
demonstrating significant advantages in Remote Sensing (RS) applications.
Though numerous studies enhancing LDMs have been conducted, investigations
explicitly targeting improvements within the intrinsic latent space remain
scarce. This paper proposes an innovative perspective, utilizing the Discrete
Wavelet Transform (DWT) to enhance the VAE's latent space representation,
designed for satellite imagery. The proposed method, ExpDWT-VAE, introduces
dual branches: one processes spatial domain input through convolutional
operations, while the other extracts and processes frequency-domain features
via 2D Haar wavelet decomposition, convolutional operation, and inverse DWT
reconstruction. These branches merge to create an integrated spatial-frequency
representation, further refined through convolutional and diagonal Gaussian
mapping into a robust latent representation. We utilize a new satellite imagery
dataset housed by the TerraFly mapping system to validate our method.
Experimental results across several performance metrics highlight the efficacy
of the proposed method at enhancing latent space representation.

Motivation: 现有轨迹预测方法假设理想化观测历史，忽略了第一人称视角固有的感知伪影（如遮挡、ID切换、跟踪漂移），导致模型鲁棒性不足。

Method: 提出BiFlow双流流匹配模型，同时去噪历史观测和预测未来运动；引入EgoAnchor机制，通过特征调制将历史特征注入预测解码器。

Result: BiFlow在minADE和minFDE指标上平均降低10-15%，实现了最先进的性能，并展现出卓越的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该基准和模型为开发真正适应真实世界第一人称感知挑战的轨迹预测系统提供了关键基础。

Abstract: Reliable trajectory prediction from an ego-centric perspective is crucial for
robotic navigation in human-centric environments. However, existing methods
typically assume idealized observation histories, failing to account for the
perceptual artifacts inherent in first-person vision, such as occlusions, ID
switches, and tracking drift. This discrepancy between training assumptions and
deployment reality severely limits model robustness. To bridge this gap, we
introduce EgoTraj-Bench, the first real-world benchmark that grounds noisy,
first-person visual histories in clean, bird's-eye-view future trajectories,
enabling robust learning under realistic perceptual constraints. Building on
this benchmark, we propose BiFlow, a dual-stream flow matching model that
concurrently denoises historical observations and forecasts future motion by
leveraging a shared latent representation. To better model agent intent, BiFlow
incorporates our EgoAnchor mechanism, which conditions the prediction decoder
on distilled historical features via feature modulation. Extensive experiments
show that BiFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance, reducing minADE and
minFDE by 10-15% on average and demonstrating superior robustness. We
anticipate that our benchmark and model will provide a critical foundation for
developing trajectory forecasting systems truly resilient to the challenges of
real-world, ego-centric perception.

Abstract: The accurate interpretation of chest radiographs using automated methods is a
critical task in medical imaging. This paper presents a comparative analysis
between a supervised lightweight Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and a
state-of-the-art, zero-shot medical Vision-Language Model (VLM), BiomedCLIP,
across two distinct diagnostic tasks: pneumonia detection on the PneumoniaMNIST
benchmark and tuberculosis detection on the Shenzhen TB dataset. Our
experiments show that supervised CNNs serve as highly competitive baselines in
both cases. While the default zero-shot performance of the VLM is lower, we
demonstrate that its potential can be unlocked via a simple yet crucial remedy:
decision threshold calibration. By optimizing the classification threshold on a
validation set, the performance of BiomedCLIP is significantly boosted across
both datasets. For pneumonia detection, calibration enables the zero-shot VLM
to achieve a superior F1-score of 0.8841, surpassing the supervised CNN's
0.8803. For tuberculosis detection, calibration dramatically improves the
F1-score from 0.4812 to 0.7684, bringing it close to the supervised baseline's
0.7834. This work highlights a key insight: proper calibration is essential for
leveraging the full diagnostic power of zero-shot VLMs, enabling them to match

Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents powered by Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs) promise human-like interaction with software applications, yet
long-horizon tasks remain challenging due to memory limitations. Existing
approaches either truncate history or rely on simple textual summaries, which
risk losing critical information when past visual details become necessary for
future decisions. In this paper, we propose \textbf{PAL-UI} (\textbf{P}lanning
with \textbf{A}ctive \textbf{L}ook-back), a novel framework that enables GUI
agents to adaptively retrieve past observations when required. PAL-UI combines
a dual-level summarization agent, capturing both observation-level cues and
action-level outcomes, with a dedicated retrieval tool that allows the agent to
recall specific historical screenshots during planning. We curate a step-level
instruction dataset of 8.6K samples from mobile GUI navigation trajectories and
train \textbf{PAL-UI-3B} and \textbf{PAL-UI-7B} models based on Qwen2.5-VL.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that PAL-UI significantly outperforms
baseline models and prior methods in mobile GUI navigation tasks, even under
data-efficient settings. Moreover, PAL-UI exhibits strong cross-domain
generalization, achieving notable improvements in web navigation without
additional training. Our work highlights the potential of active memory
retrieval for long-horizon planning capabilities of vision-based GUI agents.

Abstract: Precise delineation of meningiomas is crucial for effective radiotherapy (RT)
planning, directly influencing treatment efficacy and preservation of adjacent
healthy tissues. While automated deep learning approaches have demonstrated
considerable potential, achieving consistently accurate clinical segmentation
remains challenging due to tumor heterogeneity. Interactive Medical Image
Segmentation (IMIS) addresses this challenge by integrating advanced AI
techniques with clinical input. However, generic segmentation tools, despite
widespread applicability, often lack the specificity required for clinically
critical and disease-specific tasks like meningioma RT planning. To overcome
these limitations, we introduce Interactive-MEN-RT, a dedicated IMIS tool
specifically developed for clinician-assisted 3D meningioma segmentation in RT
workflows. The system incorporates multiple clinically relevant interaction
methods, including point annotations, bounding boxes, lasso tools, and
scribbles, enhancing usability and clinical precision. In our evaluation
involving 500 contrast-enhanced T1-weighted MRI scans from the BraTS 2025
Meningioma RT Segmentation Challenge, Interactive-MEN-RT demonstrated
substantial improvement compared to other segmentation methods, achieving Dice
similarity coefficients of up to 77.6\% and Intersection over Union scores of
64.8\%. These results emphasize the need for clinically tailored segmentation
solutions in critical applications such as meningioma RT planning. The code is

Abstract: Diffusion Transformer has shown remarkable abilities in generating
high-fidelity videos, delivering visually coherent frames and rich details over
extended durations. However, existing video generation models still fall short
in subject-consistent video generation due to an inherent difficulty in parsing
prompts that specify complex spatial relationships, temporal logic, and
interactions among multiple subjects. To address this issue, we propose
BindWeave, a unified framework that handles a broad range of subject-to-video
scenarios from single-subject cases to complex multi-subject scenes with
heterogeneous entities. To bind complex prompt semantics to concrete visual
subjects, we introduce an MLLM-DiT framework in which a pretrained multimodal
large language model performs deep cross-modal reasoning to ground entities and
disentangle roles, attributes, and interactions, yielding subject-aware hidden
states that condition the diffusion transformer for high-fidelity
subject-consistent video generation. Experiments on the OpenS2V benchmark
demonstrate that our method achieves superior performance across subject
consistency, naturalness, and text relevance in generated videos, outperforming
existing open-source and commercial models.

Conclusion: SCNet通过频谱控制有效解决了自监督去噪中的高频细节保留和噪声学习问题。

Abstract: Current self-supervised denoising methods for paired noisy images typically
involve mapping one noisy image through the network to the other noisy image.
However, after measuring the spectral bias of such methods using our proposed
Image Pair Frequency-Band Similarity, it suffers from two practical
limitations. Firstly, the high-frequency structural details in images are not
preserved well enough. Secondly, during the process of fitting high
frequencies, the network learns high-frequency noise from the mapped noisy
images. To address these challenges, we introduce a Spectral Controlling
network (SCNet) to optimize self-supervised denoising of paired noisy images.
First, we propose a selection strategy to choose frequency band components for
noisy images, to accelerate the convergence speed of training. Next, we present
a parameter optimization method that restricts the learning ability of
convolutional kernels to high-frequency noise using the Lipschitz constant,
without changing the network structure. Finally, we introduce the Spectral
Separation and low-rank Reconstruction module (SSR module), which separates

TL;DR: VLOD-TTA是一个用于视觉语言目标检测器的测试时适应框架，通过IoU加权的熵目标和图像条件提示选择来提升在领域偏移下的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉语言目标检测器在零样本识别方面表现优异，但在领域偏移下性能会下降，需要一种有效的测试时适应方法来改善这种情况。

Method: 1. 提出IoU加权的熵目标函数，专注于空间一致的提案簇并减少孤立框的确认偏差；2. 引入图像条件提示选择，根据图像级兼容性对提示进行排序，并将最有信息的提示与检测器logits融合。

Result: 在多种分布偏移（风格化域、驾驶场景、低光条件和常见损坏）上的基准测试显示，该方法在YOLO-World和Grounding DINO上相比零样本和TTA基线都取得了持续改进。

Conclusion: VLOD-TTA框架有效提升了视觉语言目标检测器在领域偏移下的性能，通过提案重叠和图像条件提示分数实现了稳定的测试时适应。

Abstract: Vision-language object detectors (VLODs) such as YOLO-World and Grounding
DINO achieve impressive zero-shot recognition by aligning region proposals with
text representations. However, their performance often degrades under domain
shift. We introduce VLOD-TTA, a test-time adaptation (TTA) framework for VLODs
that leverages dense proposal overlap and image-conditioned prompt scores.
First, an IoU-weighted entropy objective is proposed that concentrates
adaptation on spatially coherent proposal clusters and reduces confirmation
bias from isolated boxes. Second, image-conditioned prompt selection is
introduced, which ranks prompts by image-level compatibility and fuses the most
informative prompts with the detector logits. Our benchmarking across diverse
distribution shifts -- including stylized domains, driving scenes, low-light
conditions, and common corruptions -- shows the effectiveness of our method on
two state-of-the-art VLODs, YOLO-World and Grounding DINO, with consistent
improvements over the zero-shot and TTA baselines. Code :

TL;DR: MathSticks是一个用于视觉符号组合推理的基准测试，通过火柴棒方程修正任务来评估模型在视觉感知、符号操作和算术一致性方面的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型在组合推理方面存在局限，需要建立一个统一评估视觉感知、符号操作和算术一致性的基准测试。

Method: 创建包含140万生成实例的基准测试，包含文本引导和纯视觉两种设置，涵盖数字规模、移动复杂度、解决方案多样性和运算符变化等维度。

Result: 评估14个视觉语言模型显示：闭源模型仅能处理简单案例，开源模型在视觉模式下失败，而人类准确率超过90%。

Conclusion: MathSticks为推进跨视觉和符号的组合推理提供了严格的测试平台。

Abstract: We introduce \textsc{MathSticks}, a benchmark for Visual Symbolic
Compositional Reasoning (VSCR), which unifies visual perception, symbolic
manipulation, and arithmetic consistency. Each task presents an incorrect
matchstick equation that must be corrected by moving one or two sticks under
strict conservation rules. The benchmark includes both text-guided and purely
visual settings, systematically covering digit scale, move complexity, solution
multiplicity, and operator variation, with 1.4M generated instances and a
curated test set. Evaluations of 14 vision--language models reveal substantial
limitations: closed-source models succeed only on simple cases, open-source
models fail in the visual regime, while humans exceed 90\% accuracy. These
findings establish \textsc{MathSticks} as a rigorous testbed for advancing
compositional reasoning across vision and symbols. Our code and dataset are

*Yuexin Wang,Xiaolei Wang,Yizheng Gong,Jimin Xiao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了NAGL框架，利用正常和异常样本作为参考，通过残差挖掘和异常特征学习实现跨领域通用异常检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有通用异常检测方法仅使用正常样本作为参考，忽略了真实场景中可用的异常样本包含的宝贵信息。

Method: NAGL框架包含两个关键组件：残差挖掘(RM)从正常-异常参考残差中提取异常模式，异常特征学习(AFL)通过残差映射自适应学习查询图像中的异常特征。

Result: 在多个基准测试上的广泛实验表明，该方法显著优于现有的GAD方法。

Conclusion: 这是首个在通用异常检测中采用正常和异常样本混合作为参考的工作，能更准确高效地进行跨领域异常检测。

Abstract: Generalist Anomaly Detection (GAD) aims to train a unified model on an
original domain that can detect anomalies in new target domains. Previous GAD
methods primarily use only normal samples as references, overlooking the
valuable information contained in anomalous samples that are often available in
real-world scenarios. To address this limitation, we propose a more practical
approach: normal-abnormal-guided generalist anomaly detection, which leverages
both normal and anomalous samples as references to guide anomaly detection
across diverse domains. We introduce the Normal-Abnormal Generalist Learning
(NAGL) framework, consisting of two key components: Residual Mining (RM) and
Anomaly Feature Learning (AFL). RM extracts abnormal patterns from
normal-abnormal reference residuals to establish transferable anomaly
representations, while AFL adaptively learns anomaly features in query images
through residual mapping to identify instance-aware anomalies. Our approach
effectively utilizes both normal and anomalous references for more accurate and
efficient cross-domain anomaly detection. Extensive experiments across multiple
benchmarks demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing GAD
approaches. This work represents the first to adopt a mixture of normal and
abnormal samples as references in generalist anomaly detection. The code and
datasets are available at https://github.com/JasonKyng/NAGL.

TL;DR: RAF是一种高效的图像特征提取技术，通过融合相对特征和绝对特征来增强基于图像的迭代方法选择，解决了传统方法中不同矩阵可能产生相同图像表示的问题，提高了选择准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于图像的迭代方法选择方法存在特征提取技术可能将不同矩阵编码为相同图像表示的问题，导致相同的选择和次优方法选择。

Method: 提出RAF（相对-绝对融合）特征提取技术，同时提取和融合图像表示作为相对特征，以及相应的数值作为绝对特征，实现全面的矩阵表示。

Result: 在SuiteSparse和BMCMat数据集上的综合评估显示，RAF将稀疏线性系统的求解时间减少了0.08s-0.29s，比传统基于图像的选择方法快5.86%-11.50%，达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: RAF通过防止不同矩阵间的特征歧义，提高了选择准确性，释放了基于图像选择方法的潜力，在稀疏线性系统求解中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Iterative method selection is crucial for solving sparse linear systems
because these methods inherently lack robustness. Though image-based selection
approaches have shown promise, their feature extraction techniques might encode
distinct matrices into identical image representations, leading to the same
selection and suboptimal method. In this paper, we introduce RAF
(Relative-Absolute Fusion), an efficient feature extraction technique to
enhance image-based selection approaches. By simultaneously extracting and
fusing image representations as relative features with corresponding numerical
values as absolute features, RAF achieves comprehensive matrix representations
that prevent feature ambiguity across distinct matrices, thus improving
selection accuracy and unlocking the potential of image-based selection
approaches. We conducted comprehensive evaluations of RAF on SuiteSparse and
our developed BMCMat (Balanced Multi-Classification Matrix dataset),
demonstrating solution time reductions of 0.08s-0.29s for sparse linear
systems, which is 5.86%-11.50% faster than conventional image-based selection
approaches and achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. BMCMat is

*Naru Suzuki,Takehiko Ohkawa,Tatsuro Banno,Jihyun Lee,Ryosuke Furuta,Yoichi Sato*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于扩散模型的生成先验方法，通过利用从大型视觉语言模型推断的affordance感知文本描述来指导手部姿态优化，以解决严重遮挡下的3D手部姿态重建问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当手部大部分区域被自身或物体严重遮挡时，人类通常利用上下文知识（如affordance，即物体的形状和功能暗示了如何抓握）来解决这种模糊性。受此启发，研究旨在利用affordance感知的文本描述来指导手部姿态优化。

Method: 采用基于扩散的生成模型，学习在affordance描述条件下的合理手部姿态分布。这些affordance描述是从大型视觉语言模型推断的手-物交互文本描述。该方法能够将遮挡区域优化为更准确且功能连贯的手部姿态。

Result: 在HOGraspNet数据集（包含严重遮挡的3D手-affordance数据集）上的大量实验表明，与最近的回归方法和缺乏上下文推理的基于扩散的优化方法相比，affordance指导的优化显著提高了手部姿态估计的准确性。

Conclusion: 通过结合affordance感知的文本描述和扩散生成模型，能够有效解决严重遮挡下的手部姿态重建问题，生成更准确和功能合理的手部姿态。

Abstract: How can we reconstruct 3D hand poses when large portions of the hand are
heavily occluded by itself or by objects? Humans often resolve such ambiguities
by leveraging contextual knowledge -- such as affordances, where an object's
shape and function suggest how the object is typically grasped. Inspired by
this observation, we propose a generative prior for hand pose refinement guided
by affordance-aware textual descriptions of hand-object interactions (HOI). Our
method employs a diffusion-based generative model that learns the distribution
of plausible hand poses conditioned on affordance descriptions, which are
inferred from a large vision-language model (VLM). This enables the refinement
of occluded regions into more accurate and functionally coherent hand poses.
Extensive experiments on HOGraspNet, a 3D hand-affordance dataset with severe
occlusions, demonstrate that our affordance-guided refinement significantly
improves hand pose estimation over both recent regression methods and
diffusion-based refinement lacking contextual reasoning.

TL;DR: 提出EPIC框架，通过渐进一致性蒸馏解决多模态大模型中视觉token压缩带来的训练困难问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉token在多模态大模型中消耗大量计算资源，现有压缩方法忽视了压缩带来的特征空间扰动导致的训练困难

Method: 通过分解token压缩引入的特征空间扰动，提出token一致性蒸馏和层一致性蒸馏，利用教师模型指导进行渐进学习

Result: 实验证明该框架具有优越的有效性、鲁棒性和泛化能力

Conclusion: EPIC框架通过渐进一致性蒸馏有效解决了视觉token压缩带来的训练困难问题

Abstract: Visual tokens consume substantial computational resources in multi-modal
large models (MLLMs), significantly compromising their efficiency. Recent works
have attempted to improve efficiency by compressing visual tokens during
training, either through modifications to model components or by introducing
additional parameters. However, they often overlook the increased learning
difficulty caused by such compression, as the model's parameter space struggles
to quickly adapt to the substantial perturbations in the feature space induced
by token compression. In this work, we propose to develop Efficient MLLMs via
Progressive Consistency Distillation (EPIC), a progressive learning framework.
Specifically, by decomposing the feature space perturbations introduced by
token compression along the token-wise and layer-wise dimensions, we introduce
token consistency distillation and layer consistency distillation,
respectively, aiming to reduce the training difficulty by leveraging guidance
from a teacher model and following a progressive learning trajectory. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the superior effectiveness, robustness, and
generalization capabilities of our proposed framework.

TL;DR: CardioBench是一个用于超声心动图基础模型的标准化基准测试，整合了8个公开数据集，涵盖4个回归和5个分类任务，评估了多种基础模型在零样本、探测和对齐协议下的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 超声心动图基础模型缺乏标准化评估基准，现有解决方案多在私有数据上评估，限制了可比性。超声心动图面临噪声采集、高帧冗余和公开数据集有限等独特挑战。

Method: 将8个公开数据集统一为标准测试套件，涵盖功能、结构、诊断和视图识别等任务。在一致的零样本、探测和对齐协议下评估心脏专用、生物医学和通用编码器。

Result: 不同模型家族展现出互补优势：时序建模对功能回归至关重要，检索在分布偏移下提供鲁棒性，领域特定文本编码器捕获生理学意义轴。通用编码器迁移能力强但难以处理细粒度区分。

Conclusion: CardioBench通过发布预处理、分割和公开评估流程，建立了可复现的参考点，为未来超声心动图基础模型设计提供可操作的见解。

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) are reshaping medical imaging, yet their application
in echocardiography remains limited. While several echocardiography-specific
FMs have recently been introduced, no standardized benchmark exists to evaluate
them. Echocardiography poses unique challenges, including noisy acquisitions,
high frame redundancy, and limited public datasets. Most existing solutions
evaluate on private data, restricting comparability. To address this, we
introduce CardioBench, a comprehensive benchmark for echocardiography FMs.
CardioBench unifies eight publicly available datasets into a standardized suite
spanning four regression and five classification tasks, covering functional,
structural, diagnostic, and view recognition endpoints. We evaluate several
leading FM, including cardiac-specific, biomedical, and general-purpose
encoders, under consistent zero-shot, probing, and alignment protocols. Our
results highlight complementary strengths across model families: temporal
modeling is critical for functional regression, retrieval provides robustness
under distribution shift, and domain-specific text encoders capture
physiologically meaningful axes. General-purpose encoders transfer strongly and
often close the gap with probing, but struggle with fine-grained distinctions
like view classification and subtle pathology recognition. By releasing
preprocessing, splits, and public evaluation pipelines, CardioBench establishes
a reproducible reference point and offers actionable insights to guide the
design of future echocardiography foundation models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有确定性模型难以处理自遮挡和复杂手部关节引起的姿态模糊性，而现有概率方法仅限于单阶段估计，无法实现准确的3D重建。

Method: 两阶段级联扩散框架：第一阶段使用联合扩散模型采样多样化的3D关节假设，第二阶段使用网格潜在扩散模型在关节样本条件下重建3D手部网格。

Result: 在FreiHAND和HO3Dv2数据集上实现了最先进的性能，同时有效建模了姿态分布。

Conclusion: 该框架成功结合了概率建模与级联细化的优势，提高了3D手部姿态重建的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Deterministic models for 3D hand pose reconstruction, whether single-staged
or cascaded, struggle with pose ambiguities caused by self-occlusions and
complex hand articulations. Existing cascaded approaches refine predictions in
a coarse-to-fine manner but remain deterministic and cannot capture pose
uncertainties. Recent probabilistic methods model pose distributions yet are
restricted to single-stage estimation, which often fails to produce accurate 3D
reconstructions without refinement. To address these limitations, we propose a
coarse-to-fine cascaded diffusion framework that combines probabilistic
modeling with cascaded refinement. The first stage is a joint diffusion model
that samples diverse 3D joint hypotheses, and the second stage is a Mesh Latent
Diffusion Model (Mesh LDM) that reconstructs a 3D hand mesh conditioned on a
joint sample. By training Mesh LDM with diverse joint hypotheses in a learned
latent space, our framework learns distribution-aware joint-mesh relationships
and robust hand priors. Furthermore, the cascaded design mitigates the
difficulty of directly mapping 2D images to dense 3D poses, enhancing accuracy
through sequential refinement. Experiments on FreiHAND and HO3Dv2 demonstrate
that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance while effectively
modeling pose distributions.

Method: 基于YOLOv8架构，集成三个创新模块：SPD-Conv无损下采样保留小目标细节、CSPOK跨阶段特征融合增强多尺度表示并抑制背景噪声、VarifocalLoss损失函数聚焦高质量和难分类样本。

Result: 在自建的ForestPest数据集上，Forestpest-YOLO达到最先进性能，在检测微小、遮挡害虫方面显著优于现有基准模型。

Conclusion: Forestpest-YOLO框架有效解决了林业遥感中害虫检测的挑战，为生态保护提供了可靠的技术支持。

Abstract: Detecting agricultural pests in complex forestry environments using remote
sensing imagery is fundamental for ecological preservation, yet it is severely
hampered by practical challenges. Targets are often minuscule, heavily
occluded, and visually similar to the cluttered background, causing
conventional object detection models to falter due to the loss of fine-grained
features and an inability to handle extreme data imbalance. To overcome these
obstacles, this paper introduces Forestpest-YOLO, a detection framework
meticulously optimized for the nuances of forestry remote sensing. Building
upon the YOLOv8 architecture, our framework introduces a synergistic trio of
innovations. We first integrate a lossless downsampling module, SPD-Conv, to
ensure that critical high-resolution details of small targets are preserved
throughout the network. This is complemented by a novel cross-stage feature
fusion block, CSPOK, which dynamically enhances multi-scale feature
representation while suppressing background noise. Finally, we employ
VarifocalLoss to refine the training objective, compelling the model to focus
on high-quality and hard-to-classify samples. Extensive experiments on our
challenging, self-constructed ForestPest dataset demonstrate that
Forestpest-YOLO achieves state-of-the-art performance, showing marked
improvements in detecting small, occluded pests and significantly outperforming
established baseline models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统微生物学图像分析需要大量手动标注数据来训练模型，这个过程耗时耗力。论文旨在证明在解决新的视觉任务时，详尽的数据标注不再是必要条件。

Method: 收集了5000张培养皿图像数据集，模拟传统数据收集方法以及少样本和低样本场景。将三种视觉基础模型与传统基线模型在任务特定指标上进行对比评估。

Result: MaskDINO模型仅用150张图像微调就能达到与经过大量训练的YoloV9模型相当的性能，甚至在仅用25张图像时仍能保持竞争力，在约70%的样本上表现可靠。

Conclusion: 数据高效的基础模型能够用传统方法所需数据的一小部分就达到相当效果，使自动化微生物系统的开发更早启动，迭代改进更快，且性能上限优于传统模型。

Abstract: The process of quantifying mold colonies on Petri dish samples is of critical
importance for the assessment of indoor air quality, as high colony counts can
indicate potential health risks and deficiencies in ventilation systems.
Conventionally the automation of such a labor-intensive process, as well as
other tasks in microbiology, relies on the manual annotation of large datasets
and the subsequent extensive training of models like YoloV9. To demonstrate
that exhaustive annotation is not a prerequisite anymore when tackling a new
vision task, we compile a representative dataset of 5000 Petri dish images
annotated with bounding boxes, simulating both a traditional data collection
approach as well as few-shot and low-shot scenarios with well curated subsets
with instance level masks. We benchmark three vision foundation models against
traditional baselines on task specific metrics, reflecting realistic real-world
requirements. Notably, MaskDINO attains near-parity with an extensively trained
YoloV9 model while finetuned only on 150 images, retaining competitive
performance with as few as 25 images, still being reliable on $\approx$ 70% of
the samples. Our results show that data-efficient foundation models can match
traditional approaches with only a fraction of the required data, enabling
earlier development and faster iterative improvement of automated
microbiological systems with a superior upper-bound performance than
traditional models would achieve.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MoE-MTL方法依赖单任务预训练骨干网络，在从单任务到多任务学习过渡时存在冗余适应和低效知识共享问题。

Method: 在LoRA-based MoE中引入自适应共享专家，共享专家与稀疏专家联合归一化门控权重；通过增加LoRA专家数量同时按比例降低其秩，实现细粒度专家设计。

Result: 在PASCAL-Context基准测试中，ASE方法在各种配置下持续提升性能，验证了细粒度设计对MTL的有效性。

Conclusion: ASE方法通过自适应共享专家和细粒度专家设计，有效解决了MoE-MTL中的知识共享和过渡效率问题，提升了多任务学习性能。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has emerged as a powerful framework for multi-task
learning (MTL). However, existing MoE-MTL methods often rely on single-task
pretrained backbones and suffer from redundant adaptation and inefficient
knowledge sharing during the transition from single-task to multi-task learning
(STL to MTL). To address these limitations, we propose adaptive shared experts
(ASE) within a low-rank adaptation (LoRA) based MoE, where shared experts are
assigned router-computed gating weights jointly normalized with sparse experts.
This design facilitates STL to MTL transition, enhances expert specialization,
and cooperation. Furthermore, we incorporate fine-grained experts by increasing
the number of LoRA experts while proportionally reducing their rank, enabling
more effective knowledge sharing under a comparable parameter budget. Extensive
experiments on the PASCAL-Context benchmark, under unified training settings,
demonstrate that ASE consistently improves performance across diverse
configurations and validates the effectiveness of fine-grained designs for MTL.

Motivation: 现有的生成式视频帧插值方法只能合成固定数量的中间帧，缺乏调整生成帧率或总序列时长的灵活性，限制了实际应用。

Method: 提出Timestamp-aware Rotary Position Embedding (TaRoPE)支持任意时间戳插值，通过分解长序列生成实现任意长度插值，并采用外观-运动解耦条件策略确保时空连续性。

Conclusion: ArbInterp通过创新的时间戳感知位置编码和分段生成策略，成功实现了灵活的视频帧插值，为视频生成应用提供了更强的控制能力。

Abstract: Video frame interpolation (VFI), which generates intermediate frames from
given start and end frames, has become a fundamental function in video
generation applications. However, existing generative VFI methods are
constrained to synthesize a fixed number of intermediate frames, lacking the
flexibility to adjust generated frame rates or total sequence duration. In this
work, we present ArbInterp, a novel generative VFI framework that enables
efficient interpolation at any timestamp and of any length. Specifically, to
support interpolation at any timestamp, we propose the Timestamp-aware Rotary
Position Embedding (TaRoPE), which modulates positions in temporal RoPE to
align generated frames with target normalized timestamps. This design enables
fine-grained control over frame timestamps, addressing the inflexibility of
fixed-position paradigms in prior work. For any-length interpolation, we
decompose long-sequence generation into segment-wise frame synthesis. We
further design a novel appearance-motion decoupled conditioning strategy: it
leverages prior segment endpoints to enforce appearance consistency and
temporal semantics to maintain motion coherence, ensuring seamless
spatiotemporal transitions across segments. Experimentally, we build
comprehensive benchmarks for multi-scale frame interpolation (2x to 32x) to
assess generalizability across arbitrary interpolation factors. Results show
that ArbInterp outperforms prior methods across all scenarios with higher
fidelity and more seamless spatiotemporal continuity. Project website:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的NeRF风格迁移方法通常将风格统计信息集成到原始NeRF流水线中，导致内容保持和艺术风格化效果都不理想。

Method: 提出多级特征适配器生成多级特征网格表示，动态风格注入模块学习提取相关风格特征并自适应集成到内容模式中，通过多级级联解码器将风格化特征转换为最终风格化视图。

Result: 大量实验证明MDS-NeRF在3D风格迁移方面表现出色，能够保持多尺度空间结构同时有效传递风格特征。

Conclusion: 该方法还扩展到支持使用3D风格参考的全视角风格迁移，为NeRF风格迁移提供了创新解决方案。

Abstract: As the application of neural radiance fields (NeRFs) in various 3D vision
tasks continues to expand, numerous NeRF-based style transfer techniques have
been developed. However, existing methods typically integrate style statistics
into the original NeRF pipeline, often leading to suboptimal results in both
content preservation and artistic stylization. In this paper, we present
multi-level dynamic style transfer for NeRFs (MDS-NeRF), a novel approach that
reengineers the NeRF pipeline specifically for stylization and incorporates an
innovative dynamic style injection module. Particularly, we propose a
multi-level feature adaptor that helps generate a multi-level feature grid
representation from the content radiance field, effectively capturing the
multi-scale spatial structure of the scene. In addition, we present a dynamic
style injection module that learns to extract relevant style features and
adaptively integrates them into the content patterns. The stylized multi-level
features are then transformed into the final stylized view through our proposed
multi-level cascade decoder. Furthermore, we extend our 3D style transfer
method to support omni-view style transfer using 3D style references. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that MDS-NeRF achieves outstanding performance for 3D
style transfer, preserving multi-scale spatial structures while effectively
transferring stylistic characteristics.

*Sheng Jiang,Yuanmin Ning,Bingxi Huang,Peiyin Chen,Zhaohui Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出ADPT框架，利用大型视觉语言模型和语义模式匹配，实现无需人工监督的结构缺陷自动标注，准确率高达98%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决基础设施安全检测中手动标注成本高、效率低的问题，实现自动化缺陷标注。

Method: 集成大型视觉语言模型与语义模式匹配模块，采用优化领域特定提示和迭代自问精炼机制，通过递归验证过程处理原始视觉数据。

Result: 在缺陷与非缺陷图像区分上达到98%准确率，四类缺陷标注准确率85%-98%（类平衡），类不平衡数据集上80%-92%准确率。

Conclusion: ADPT提供可扩展、经济高效的高质量数据集构建方案，为结构损伤评估中的迁移学习和领域适应等下游任务提供有力支持。

Abstract: Automated structural defect annotation is essential for ensuring
infrastructure safety while minimizing the high costs and inefficiencies of
manual labeling. A novel agentic annotation framework, Agent-based Defect
Pattern Tagger (ADPT), is introduced that integrates Large Vision-Language
Models (LVLMs) with a semantic pattern matching module and an iterative
self-questioning refinement mechanism. By leveraging optimized domain-specific
prompting and a recursive verification process, ADPT transforms raw visual data
into high-quality, semantically labeled defect datasets without any manual
supervision. Experimental results demonstrate that ADPT achieves up to 98%
accuracy in distinguishing defective from non-defective images, and 85%-98%
annotation accuracy across four defect categories under class-balanced
settings, with 80%-92% accuracy on class-imbalanced datasets. The framework
offers a scalable and cost-effective solution for high-fidelity dataset
construction, providing strong support for downstream tasks such as transfer
learning and domain adaptation in structural damage assessment.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出COFA策略，通过前景和背景特征增强来提升视觉语言导航的泛化能力，在REVERIE和R2R数据集上达到SOTA性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言导航中，前景提供语义线索，背景包含空间连接信息，但这两者的重要性尚未充分探索

Method: 使用语义增强的地标识别分离前景和背景特征，然后通过共识驱动的在线增强策略，让智能体根据指令和位置整合两阶段投票结果

Result: 在REVERIE和R2R数据集上，在线前景-背景增强提升了基线的泛化能力并达到最先进性能

Conclusion: 前景和背景特征的在线增强能有效提升视觉语言导航的泛化性能

Abstract: Following language instructions, vision-language navigation (VLN) agents are
tasked with navigating unseen environments. While augmenting multifaceted
visual representations has propelled advancements in VLN, the significance of
foreground and background in visual observations remains underexplored.
Intuitively, foreground regions provide semantic cues, whereas the background
encompasses spatial connectivity information. Inspired on this insight, we
propose a Consensus-driven Online Feature Augmentation strategy (COFA) with
alternative foreground and background features to facilitate the navigable
generalization. Specifically, we first leverage semantically-enhanced landmark
identification to disentangle foreground and background as candidate augmented
features. Subsequently, a consensus-driven online augmentation strategy
encourages the agent to consolidate two-stage voting results on feature
preferences according to diverse instructions and navigational locations.
Experiments on REVERIE and R2R demonstrate that our online
foreground-background augmentation boosts the generalization of baseline and
attains state-of-the-art performance.

*Klara Janouskova,Cristian Gavrus,Jiri Matas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了RCOR方法，通过将定位作为识别的组成部分，实现对象中心和上下文感知的建模分离，然后进行鲁棒的非参数融合，在保持上下文信息的同时解决背景依赖问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准监督学习会导致模型过度依赖背景信息（捷径学习），限制了在真实世界部署中的鲁棒性。现有方法主要通过抑制背景来改善泛化，但牺牲了上下文信息。

Method: RCOR将定位作为识别的组成部分，分离对象中心和上下文感知建模，然后进行鲁棒的非参数融合。

Result: RCOR提高了监督模型和VLM在域内和域外背景数据集上的性能，即使在复杂场景如ImageNet-1k中也能实现定位优先的识别。

Conclusion: 定位优先的识别在复杂场景中成为可能，RCOR能够在不牺牲上下文信息的情况下同时实现鲁棒性和上下文感知。

Abstract: In visual recognition, both the object of interest (referred to as
foreground, FG, for simplicity) and its surrounding context (background, BG)
play an important role. However, standard supervised learning often leads to
unintended over-reliance on the BG, known as shortcut learning of spurious
correlations, limiting model robustness in real-world deployment settings. In
the literature, the problem is mainly addressed by suppressing the BG,
sacrificing context information for improved generalization.
  We propose RCOR -- Robust Context-Aware Object Recognition -- the first
approach that jointly achieves robustness and context-awareness without
compromising either. RCOR treats localization as an integral part of
recognition to decouple object-centric and context-aware modelling, followed by
a robust, non-parametric fusion. It improves the performance of both supervised
models and VLM on datasets with both in-domain and out-of-domain BG, even
without fine-tuning. The results confirm that localization before recognition
is now possible even in complex scenes as in ImageNet-1k.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对抗训练对一步生成至关重要，但GAN训练在实践中难以收敛且存在模式崩溃问题。研究发现条件判别器中的冗余捷径阻碍了有意义的特征提取。

Method: 采用无条件判别器(UCD)，强制判别器在没有条件注入的情况下提取更全面和鲁棒的特征，从而为生成器提供更好的监督。

Result: 在ImageNet-64数据集上达到1.47 FID，超越了StyleGAN-XL和多个最先进的一步扩散模型，性能显著提升且效率高。

Conclusion: 无条件判别器能够促进GAN训练中的纳什均衡，与经典GAN理论兼容，可作为即插即用模块实现显著性能改进。

Abstract: Adversarial training turns out to be the key to one-step generation,
especially for Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) and diffusion model
distillation. Yet in practice, GAN training hardly converges properly and
struggles in mode collapse. In this work, we quantitatively analyze the extent
of Nash equilibrium in GAN training, and conclude that redundant shortcuts by
inputting condition in $D$ disables meaningful knowledge extraction. We thereby
propose to employ an unconditional discriminator (UCD), in which $D$ is
enforced to extract more comprehensive and robust features with no condition
injection. In this way, $D$ is able to leverage better knowledge to supervise
$G$, which promotes Nash equilibrium in GAN literature. Theoretical guarantee
on compatibility with vanilla GAN theory indicates that UCD can be implemented
in a plug-in manner. Extensive experiments confirm the significant performance
improvements with high efficiency. For instance, we achieved \textbf{1.47 FID}
on the ImageNet-64 dataset, surpassing StyleGAN-XL and several state-of-the-art
one-step diffusion models. The code will be made publicly available.

Abstract: Fashion image generation has so far focused on narrow tasks such as virtual
try-on, where garments appear in clean studio environments. In contrast,
editorial fashion presents garments through dynamic poses, diverse locations,
and carefully crafted visual narratives. We introduce the task of virtual
fashion photo-shoot, which seeks to capture this richness by transforming
standardized garment images into contextually grounded editorial imagery. To
enable this new direction, we construct the first large-scale dataset of
garment-lookbook pairs, bridging the gap between e-commerce and fashion media.
Because such pairs are not readily available, we design an automated retrieval
pipeline that aligns garments across domains, combining visual-language
reasoning with object-level localization. We construct a dataset with three
garment-lookbook pair accuracy levels: high quality (10,000 pairs), medium
quality (50,000 pairs), and low quality (300,000 pairs). This dataset offers a
foundation for models that move beyond catalog-style generation and toward
fashion imagery that reflects creativity, atmosphere, and storytelling.

Result: 在多个公共数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法实现了优越的性能。

Conclusion: 该方法成功结合了几何先验和网络学习过程，为深度伪造检测提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The rapid development of deepfake generation techniques necessitates robust
face forgery detection algorithms. While methods based on Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNNs) and Transformers are effective, there is still room for
improvement in modeling the highly complex and non-linear nature of forgery
artifacts. To address this issue, we propose a novel detection method based on
the Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN). By replacing fixed activation functions
with learnable splines, our KAN-based approach is better suited to this
challenge. Furthermore, to guide the network's focus towards critical facial
areas, we introduce a Landmark-assisted Adaptive Kolmogorov-Arnold Network
(LAKAN) module. This module uses facial landmarks as a structural prior to
dynamically generate the internal parameters of the KAN, creating an
instance-specific signal that steers a general-purpose image encoder towards
the most informative facial regions with artifacts. This core innovation
creates a powerful combination between geometric priors and the network's
learning process. Extensive experiments on multiple public datasets show that
our proposed method achieves superior performance.

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have enabled
impressive generative capabilities, but they also raise significant safety
concerns due to the potential to produce harmful or undesirable content. While
concept erasure has been explored as a mitigation strategy, most existing
approaches and corresponding attack evaluations are tailored to Stable
Diffusion (SD) and exhibit limited effectiveness when transferred to
next-generation rectified flow transformers such as Flux. In this work, we
present ReFlux, the first concept attack method specifically designed to assess
the robustness of concept erasure in the latest rectified flow-based T2I
framework. Our approach is motivated by the observation that existing concept
erasure techniques, when applied to Flux, fundamentally rely on a phenomenon
known as attention localization. Building on this insight, we propose a simple
yet effective attack strategy that specifically targets this property. At its
core, a reverse-attention optimization strategy is introduced to effectively
reactivate suppressed signals while stabilizing attention. This is further
reinforced by a velocity-guided dynamic that enhances the robustness of concept
reactivation by steering the flow matching process, and a
consistency-preserving objective that maintains the global layout and preserves
unrelated content. Extensive experiments consistently demonstrate the
effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed attack method, establishing a
reliable benchmark for evaluating the robustness of concept erasure strategies
in rectified flow transformers.

Abstract: Multi-sensor fusion in autonomous vehicles is becoming more common to offer a
more robust alternative for several perception tasks. This need arises from the
unique contribution of each sensor in collecting data: camera-radar fusion
offers a cost-effective solution by combining rich semantic information from
cameras with accurate distance measurements from radar, without incurring
excessive financial costs or overwhelming data processing requirements. Map
segmentation is a critical task for enabling effective vehicle behaviour in its
environment, yet it continues to face significant challenges in achieving high
accuracy and meeting real-time performance requirements. Therefore, this work
presents a novel and efficient map segmentation architecture, using cameras and
radars, in the \acrfull{bev} space. Our model introduces a real-time map
segmentation architecture considering aspects such as high accuracy, per-class
balancing, and inference time. To accomplish this, we use an advanced loss set
together with a new lightweight head to improve the perception results. Our
results show that, with these modifications, our approach achieves results
comparable to large models, reaching 53.5 mIoU, while also setting a new
benchmark for inference time, improving it by 260\% over the strongest baseline
models.

Abstract: Clouds significantly affect the quality of optical satellite images, which
seriously limits their precise application. Recently, deep learning has been
widely applied to cloud detection and has achieved satisfactory results.
However, the lack of distinctive features in thin clouds and the low quality of
training samples limit the cloud detection accuracy of deep learning methods,
leaving space for further improvements. In this paper, we propose a weakly
supervised cloud detection method that combines spectral features and
multi-scale scene-level deep network (SpecMCD) to obtain highly accurate
pixel-level cloud masks. The method first utilizes a progressive training
framework with a multi-scale scene-level dataset to train the multi-scale
scene-level cloud detection network. Pixel-level cloud probability maps are
then obtained by combining the multi-scale probability maps and cloud thickness
map based on the characteristics of clouds in dense cloud coverage and large
cloud-area coverage images. Finally, adaptive thresholds are generated based on
the differentiated regions of the scene-level cloud masks at different scales
and combined with distance-weighted optimization to obtain binary cloud masks.
Two datasets, WDCD and GF1MS-WHU, comprising a total of 60 Gaofen-1
multispectral (GF1-MS) images, were used to verify the effectiveness of the
proposed method. Compared to the other weakly supervised cloud detection
methods such as WDCD and WSFNet, the F1-score of the proposed SpecMCD method
shows an improvement of over 7.82%, highlighting the superiority and potential
of the SpecMCD method for cloud detection under different cloud coverage
conditions.

Motivation: 一致性模型(CMs)虽然能实现一步或两步采样，但需要长时间训练和大批量才能获得有竞争力的样本质量。研究发现CMs在收敛附近的训练动态中，切线方向存在振荡问题，不指向数据流形。

Method: 提出流形特征距离(MFD)损失函数，该损失能提供与流形对齐的切线方向，使更新方向指向数据流形。该方法称为Align Your Tangent (AYT)。

Conclusion: 通过解决一致性模型训练中的振荡切线问题，AYT方法实现了训练效率的显著提升，为快速高质量生成模型提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: With diffusion and flow matching models achieving state-of-the-art generating
performance, the interest of the community now turned to reducing the inference
time without sacrificing sample quality. Consistency Models (CMs), which are
trained to be consistent on diffusion or probability flow ordinary differential
equation (PF-ODE) trajectories, enable one or two-step flow or diffusion
sampling. However, CMs typically require prolonged training with large batch
sizes to obtain competitive sample quality. In this paper, we examine the
training dynamics of CMs near convergence and discover that CM tangents -- CM
output update directions -- are quite oscillatory, in the sense that they move
parallel to the data manifold, not towards the manifold. To mitigate
oscillatory tangents, we propose a new loss function, called the manifold
feature distance (MFD), which provides manifold-aligned tangents that point
toward the data manifold. Consequently, our method -- dubbed Align Your Tangent
(AYT) -- can accelerate CM training by orders of magnitude and even out-perform
the learned perceptual image patch similarity metric (LPIPS). Furthermore, we
find that our loss enables training with extremely small batch sizes without
compromising sample quality. Code: https://github.com/1202kbs/AYT

Conclusion: U2-rPCA方法在保持可解释性的同时，有效解决了超声微血管成像中的杂波滤波问题，无需真实标签训练。

Abstract: High-sensitivity clutter filtering is a fundamental step in ultrasound
microvascular imaging. Singular value decomposition (SVD) and robust principal
component analysis (rPCA) are the main clutter filtering strategies. However,
both strategies are limited in feature modeling and tissue-blood flow
separation for high-quality microvascular imaging. Recently, deep
learning-based clutter filtering has shown potential in more thoroughly
separating tissue and blood flow signals. However, the existing supervised
filters face the challenges of interpretability and lack of in-vitro and
in-vivo ground truths. While the interpretability issue can be addressed by
algorithm deep unfolding, the training ground truth remains unsolved. To this
end, this paper proposes an unsupervised unfolded rPCA (U2-rPCA) method that
preserves mathematical interpretability and is insusceptible to learning
labels. Specifically, U2-rPCA is unfolded from an iteratively reweighted least
squares (IRLS) rPCA baseline with intrinsic low-rank and sparse regularization.
A sparse-enhancement unit is added to the network to strengthen its capability
to capture the sparse micro-flow signals. U2-rPCA is like an adaptive filter
that is trained with part of the image sequence and then used for the following
frames. Experimental validations on a in-silico dataset and public in-vivo
datasets demonstrated the outperformance of U2-rPCA when compared with the
SVD-based method, the rPCA baseline, and another deep learning-based filter.
Particularly, the proposed method improved the contrastto-noise ratio (CNR) of
the power Doppler image by 2 dB to 10 dB when compared with other methods.
Furthermore, the effectiveness of the building modules of U2-rPCA was validated
through ablation studies.

Abstract: The intricate morphology of brain vessels poses significant challenges for
automatic segmentation models, which usually focus on a single imaging
modality. However, accurately treating brain-related conditions requires a
comprehensive understanding of the cerebrovascular tree, regardless of the
specific acquisition procedure. Our framework effectively segments brain
arteries and veins in various datasets through image-to-image translation while
avoiding domain-specific model design and data harmonization between the source
and the target domain. This is accomplished by employing disentanglement
techniques to independently manipulate different image properties, allowing
them to move from one domain to another in a label-preserving manner.
Specifically, we focus on manipulating vessel appearances during adaptation
while preserving spatial information, such as shapes and locations, which are
crucial for correct segmentation. Our evaluation effectively bridges large and
varied domain gaps across medical centers, image modalities, and vessel types.
Additionally, we conduct ablation studies on the optimal number of required
annotations and other architectural choices. The results highlight our
framework's robustness and versatility, demonstrating the potential of domain
adaptation methodologies to perform cerebrovascular image segmentation in
multiple scenarios accurately. Our code is available at

Motivation: 现有生成AI方法忽略了图像的几何结构，仅关注概率方法，且通常假设潜在空间的概率分布是均匀或无趣的。本文旨在统一几何和概率视角。

Method: 提出了几何框架和基于核的概率方法，将扩散模型解释为向图像流形的投影，并构建了确定性模型MPPM，可在表示空间和潜在空间中操作。

Conclusion: 通过统一几何和概率视角，本文不仅解释了扩散模型的工作原理，还开发了性能更优的新模型，为生成AI提供了新的理论框架。

Abstract: The foundational premise of generative AI for images is the assumption that
images are inherently low-dimensional objects embedded within a
high-dimensional space. Additionally, it is often implicitly assumed that
thematic image datasets form smooth or piecewise smooth manifolds. Common
approaches overlook the geometric structure and focus solely on probabilistic
methods, approximating the probability distribution through universal
approximation techniques such as the kernel method. In some generative models,
the low dimensional nature of the data manifest itself by the introduction of a
lower dimensional latent space. Yet, the probability distribution in the latent
or the manifold coordinate space is considered uninteresting and is predefined
or considered uniform. This study unifies the geometric and probabilistic
perspectives by providing a geometric framework and a kernel-based
probabilistic method simultaneously. The resulting framework demystifies
diffusion models by interpreting them as a projection mechanism onto the
manifold of ``good images''. This interpretation leads to the construction of a
new deterministic model, the Manifold-Probabilistic Projection Model (MPPM),
which operates in both the representation (pixel) space and the latent space.
We demonstrate that the Latent MPPM (LMPPM) outperforms the Latent Diffusion
Model (LDM) across various datasets, achieving superior results in terms of
image restoration and generation.

*Aaron Kujawa,Thomas Booth,Tom Vercauteren*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究提出使用二进制编码替代one-hot编码来减少医学图像分割的计算和内存需求，但在108类全脑分割任务中，二进制编码方法的性能显著低于one-hot编码。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决医学图像分割中类别数量多时，one-hot编码带来的计算复杂度和内存需求线性增长问题，探索更高效的编码策略。

Method: 提出二进制编码方法家族，包括普通二进制编码、纠错输出码(ECOC)、类别加权、硬/软解码、类别到码字分配和标签嵌入树等技术。

Result: 在108类全脑分割任务中，二进制编码方法的Dice相似系数在39.3到73.8之间，显著低于one-hot编码的82.4。

Conclusion: 虽然二进制编码在计算效率上有优势，但在分割质量上难以达到最先进水平，希望这项工作能启发未来对大型多类分割任务紧凑编码策略的研究。

Abstract: This work presents novel methods to reduce computational and memory
requirements for medical image segmentation with a large number of classes. We
curiously observe challenges in maintaining state-of-the-art segmentation
performance with all of the explored options. Standard learning-based methods
typically employ one-hot encoding of class labels. The computational complexity
and memory requirements thus increase linearly with the number of classes. We
propose a family of binary encoding approaches instead of one-hot encoding to
reduce the computational complexity and memory requirements to logarithmic in
the number of classes. In addition to vanilla binary encoding, we investigate
the effects of error-correcting output codes (ECOCs), class weighting,
hard/soft decoding, class-to-codeword assignment, and label embedding trees. We
apply the methods to the use case of whole brain parcellation with 108 classes
based on 3D MRI images. While binary encodings have proven efficient in
so-called extreme classification problems in computer vision, we faced
challenges in reaching state-of-the-art segmentation quality with binary
encodings. Compared to one-hot encoding (Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) =
82.4 (2.8)), we report reduced segmentation performance with the binary
segmentation approaches, achieving DSCs in the range from 39.3 to 73.8.
Informative negative results all too often go unpublished. We hope that this
work inspires future research of compact encoding strategies for large
multi-class segmentation tasks.

*Jinchang Zhang,Zijun Li,Jiakai Lin,Guoyu Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于事件图像知识蒸馏的开放词汇目标检测框架，通过CLIP教师模型指导事件学生模型学习视觉表示，结合SNN自适应事件分割和CNN处理，解决事件相机在开放词汇检测中的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 事件相机在目标检测中具有高速响应、低延迟和抗运动模糊等优势，但缺乏纹理和颜色信息，使得开放词汇检测特别困难。现有方法局限于预定义类别，无法泛化到新物体。

Method: 使用图像帧作为教师模型输入，通过空间注意力蒸馏指导事件学生模型学习CLIP的视觉表示；设计混合SNN-CNN框架，SNN自适应确定事件分割时机，CNN处理特征进行目标检测。

Result: 该方法能够直接从原始事件输入中学习有意义的视觉特征，同时继承CLIP的广泛视觉知识，避免了固定分组事件分割方法造成的关键时间信息丢失。

Conclusion: 提出的知识蒸馏框架成功弥合了图像和事件流之间的模态差距，实现了事件数据上的开放词汇目标检测，为事件相机在复杂环境中的应用提供了新思路。

Abstract: Event cameras offer advantages in object detection tasks due to high-speed
response, low latency, and robustness to motion blur. However, event cameras
lack texture and color information, making open-vocabulary detection
particularly challenging. Current event-based detection methods are typically
trained on predefined categories, limiting their ability to generalize to novel
objects, where encountering previously unseen objects is common.
Vision-language models (VLMs) have enabled open-vocabulary object detection in
RGB images. However, the modality gap between images and event streams makes it
ineffective to directly transfer CLIP to event data, as CLIP was not designed
for event streams. To bridge this gap, we propose an event-image knowledge
distillation framework that leverages CLIP's semantic understanding to achieve
open-vocabulary object detection on event data. Instead of training CLIP
directly on event streams, we use image frames as inputs to a teacher model,
guiding the event-based student model to learn CLIP's rich visual
representations. Through spatial attention-based distillation, the student
network learns meaningful visual features directly from raw event inputs while
inheriting CLIP's broad visual knowledge. Furthermore, to prevent information
loss due to event data segmentation, we design a hybrid spiking neural network
(SNN) and convolutional neural network (CNN) framework. Unlike fixed-group
event segmentation methods, which often discard crucial temporal information,
our SNN adaptively determines the optimal event segmentation moments, ensuring
that key temporal features are extracted. The extracted event features are then
processed by CNNs for object detection.

TL;DR: 提出ProtoMask模型，使用图像分割基础模型改进原型映射的真实性，通过将显著性图计算限制在预定义的语义图像块来减少可视化不确定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于原型案例推理的方法通常依赖额外的后处理显著性技术来解释学习到的原型语义，但这些技术的可靠性和质量受到质疑。

Method: 使用图像分割基础模型生成分割掩码，用每个掩码的边界框裁剪图像，构建名为ProtoMask的新模型架构，每个掩码产生独立的输入。

Result: 在三个细粒度分类数据集上的实验表明，与其他流行模型相比具有竞争性能，并提供了独特的可解释性特征。

Conclusion: ProtoMask模型通过结合图像分割技术，显著提高了原型映射的真实性和可解释性，在保持竞争性能的同时提供了更可靠的可视化解释。

Abstract: XAI gained considerable importance in recent years. Methods based on
prototypical case-based reasoning have shown a promising improvement in
explainability. However, these methods typically rely on additional post-hoc
saliency techniques to explain the semantics of learned prototypes. Multiple
critiques have been raised about the reliability and quality of such
techniques. For this reason, we study the use of prominent image segmentation
foundation models to improve the truthfulness of the mapping between embedding
and input space. We aim to restrict the computation area of the saliency map to
a predefined semantic image patch to reduce the uncertainty of such
visualizations. To perceive the information of an entire image, we use the
bounding box from each generated segmentation mask to crop the image. Each mask
results in an individual input in our novel model architecture named ProtoMask.
We conduct experiments on three popular fine-grained classification datasets
with a wide set of metrics, providing a detailed overview on explainability
characteristics. The comparison with other popular models demonstrates
competitive performance and unique explainability features of our model.

*Jiakai Lin,Jinchang Zhang,Guoyu Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MoE-SGT是一个增强概念瓶颈模型的多模态推理框架，通过图变换器和混合专家模块显式建模概念间的结构化关系，提升复杂概念推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统概念瓶颈模型(CBMs)通常是单模态的，且忽略了概念间的结构化关系，无法有效建模复杂的概念交互。

Method: 构建答案-概念和答案-问题图来建模多模态输入的结构化关系，集成图变换器捕捉多层次依赖，并用混合专家模块替换前馈层以动态分配推理任务。

Result: 在多个数据集上，MoE-SGT比其他概念瓶颈网络实现了更高的准确率。

Conclusion: 通过显式建模概念结构化关系和动态专家选择机制，MoE-SGT显著提升了模型对复杂概念推理的适应能力。

Abstract: With growing demand for interpretability in deep learning, especially in high
stakes domains, Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) address this by inserting
human understandable concepts into the prediction pipeline, but they are
generally single modal and ignore structured concept relationships. To overcome
these limitations, we present MoE-SGT, a reasoning driven framework that
augments CBMs with a structure injecting Graph Transformer and a Mixture of
Experts (MoE) module. We construct answer-concept and answer-question graphs
for multimodal inputs to explicitly model the structured relationships among
concepts. Subsequently, we integrate Graph Transformer to capture multi level
dependencies, addressing the limitations of traditional Concept Bottleneck
Models in modeling concept interactions. However, it still encounters
bottlenecks in adapting to complex concept patterns. Therefore, we replace the
feed forward layers with a Mixture of Experts (MoE) module, enabling the model
to have greater capacity in learning diverse concept relationships while
dynamically allocating reasoning tasks to different sub experts, thereby
significantly enhancing the model's adaptability to complex concept reasoning.
MoE-SGT achieves higher accuracy than other concept bottleneck networks on
multiple datasets by modeling structured relationships among concepts and
utilizing a dynamic expert selection mechanism.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种基于多模态大语言模型内在不确定性的训练免费框架，通过响应不确定性评分候选视觉输入，使模型能自主聚焦最显著的数据，在视觉搜索、长视频理解和时序定位等任务中达到与专用微调方法竞争的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在细粒度感知任务中表现不佳，如高分辨率图像中的小物体识别或长视频中的关键时刻定位。现有方法通常依赖复杂的任务特定微调，限制了泛化能力并增加了模型复杂度。

Method: 利用MLLM的内在不确定性作为主动引导信号，核心洞察是模型在遇到相关视觉信息时输出熵会降低。提出统一机制，通过响应不确定性对候选视觉输入进行评分，使模型能自主聚焦最显著的数据。

Result: 在视觉搜索、长视频理解和时序定位三个复杂视觉任务中，现成的MLLM能够达到与专用微调方法竞争的性能。

Conclusion: 利用内在不确定性是增强细粒度多模态性能的强大通用策略，验证了训练免费框架的有效性。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) often struggle with fine-grained
perception, such as identifying small objects in high-resolution images or
finding key moments in long videos. Existing works typically rely on
complicated, task-specific fine-tuning, which limits their generalizability and
increases model complexity. In this work, we propose an effective,
training-free framework that uses an MLLM's intrinsic uncertainty as a
proactive guidance signal. Our core insight is that a model's output entropy
decreases when presented with relevant visual information. We introduce a
unified mechanism that scores candidate visual inputs by response uncertainty,
enabling the model to autonomously focus on the most salient data. We apply
this simple principle to three complex visual tasks: Visual Search, Long Video
Understanding, and Temporal Grounding, allowing off-the-shelf MLLMs to achieve
performance competitive with specialized, fine-tuned methods. Our work
validates that harnessing intrinsic uncertainty is a powerful, general strategy
for enhancing fine-grained multimodal performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的基于配准的运动校正方法速度慢且对采集变异性敏感，限制了定量灌注成像的鲁棒性和可扩展性。

Method: 使用无监督深度学习管道，通过三步运动校正和鲁棒主成分分析减少对比度相关效应，同时对灌注序列和辅助图像进行对齐。在201名患者的多厂商数据上训练和验证。

Result: 深度学习方法显著改善了时间强度曲线的时间平滑性，心肌对齐效果与基线相当但优于未配准状态，灌注图显示运动减少，处理时间减少了15倍。

Conclusion: 该深度学习管道能够实现快速、鲁棒的运动校正，提高了动态和辅助图像的准确性，在多厂商数据上训练使其能够跨序列泛化，有助于定量灌注成像的临床推广。

Abstract: Background: Quantitative stress perfusion cardiovascular magnetic resonance
(CMR) is a powerful tool for assessing myocardial ischemia. Motion correction
is essential for accurate pixel-wise mapping but traditional registration-based
methods are slow and sensitive to acquisition variability, limiting robustness
and scalability.
  Methods: We developed an unsupervised deep learning-based motion correction
pipeline that replaces iterative registration with efficient one-shot
estimation. The method corrects motion in three steps and uses robust principal
component analysis to reduce contrast-related effects. It aligns the perfusion
series and auxiliary images (arterial input function and proton
density-weighted series). Models were trained and validated on multivendor data
from 201 patients, with 38 held out for testing. Performance was assessed via
temporal alignment and quantitative perfusion values, compared to a previously
published registration-based method.
  Results: The deep learning approach significantly improved temporal
smoothness of time-intensity curves (p<0.001). Myocardial alignment (Dice =
0.92 (0.04) and 0.91 (0.05)) was comparable to the baseline and superior to
before registration (Dice = 0.80 (0.09), p<0.001). Perfusion maps showed
reduced motion, with lower standard deviation in the myocardium (0.52 (0.39)
ml/min/g) compared to baseline (0.55 (0.44) ml/min/g). Processing time was
reduced 15-fold.
  Conclusion: This deep learning pipeline enables fast, robust motion
correction for stress perfusion CMR, improving accuracy across dynamic and
auxiliary images. Trained on multivendor data, it generalizes across sequences
and may facilitate broader clinical adoption of quantitative perfusion imaging.

*Annemarie Hoffsommer,Helen Schneider,Svetlana Pavlitska,J. Marius Zöllner*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究探讨了如何使用DEAP数据集中EEG通道子集进行情绪预测，通过连续小波变换将EEG数据转换为尺度图，使用视觉变换器模型实现高精度分类，仅用12个通道就达到91.57%的准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统情绪预测方法（如自我评估和面部表情分析）存在主观性和模糊性，而完整EEG测量复杂且资源密集。低成本的简化EEG设备提供了更直接、无偏的数据源，但需要验证其有效性。

Method: 使用DEAP数据集，通过连续小波变换将EEG信号转换为尺度图，然后训练视觉变换器模型进行情绪分类，重点测试减少通道数量对预测准确性的影响。

Result: 仅使用12个EEG通道，模型在预测4个象限（高/低唤醒度和效价）时达到91.57%的准确率，与使用32个通道的最先进结果96.9%相比，通道显著减少但性能仍保持较高水平。

Conclusion: 研究表明，显著减少EEG输入通道数量仍可获得高精度的情绪预测结果，这为低成本EEG设备在情感计算中的应用提供了有力支持。

Abstract: Accurately predicting emotions from brain signals has the potential to
achieve goals such as improving mental health, human-computer interaction, and
affective computing. Emotion prediction through neural signals offers a
promising alternative to traditional methods, such as self-assessment and
facial expression analysis, which can be subjective or ambiguous. Measurements
of the brain activity via electroencephalogram (EEG) provides a more direct and
unbiased data source. However, conducting a full EEG is a complex,
resource-intensive process, leading to the rise of low-cost EEG devices with
simplified measurement capabilities. This work examines how subsets of EEG
channels from the DEAP dataset can be used for sufficiently accurate emotion
prediction with low-cost EEG devices, rather than fully equipped
EEG-measurements. Using Continuous Wavelet Transformation to convert EEG data
into scaleograms, we trained a vision transformer (ViT) model for emotion
classification. The model achieved over 91,57% accuracy in predicting 4
quadrants (high/low per arousal and valence) with only 12 measuring points
(also referred to as channels). Our work shows clearly, that a significant
reduction of input channels yields high results compared to state-of-the-art
results of 96,9% with 32 channels. Training scripts to reproduce our code can

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种解决极端盲图像恢复(EBIR)的新框架，通过将极度低质量(ELQ)到高质量(HQ)的恢复过程分解为两个阶段：首先将ELQ图像投影到中间低质量(LQ)流形，然后使用现成的BIR模型恢复为HQ。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有盲图像恢复方法在面临极端退化情况时表现不佳，直接学习ELQ到HQ的映射由于巨大的域差距会导致不自然的伪影和细节丢失。

Method: 基于信息论视角，将图像恢复视为信息瓶颈问题，提出两阶段框架：学习投影器将ELQ映射到中间LQ流形，然后使用冻结的现成BIR模型恢复为HQ。

Result: 在严重退化场景下的广泛实验验证了该方法的有效性，能够稳定训练并改善恢复质量。

Conclusion: 该框架通过分解恢复过程解决了EBIR问题，支持即插即用增强现有模型，无需微调，并提供推理时提示精炼功能。

Abstract: Blind Image Restoration (BIR) methods have achieved remarkable success but
falter when faced with Extreme Blind Image Restoration (EBIR), where inputs
suffer from severe, compounded degradations beyond their training scope.
Directly learning a mapping from extremely low-quality (ELQ) to high-quality
(HQ) images is challenging due to the massive domain gap, often leading to
unnatural artifacts and loss of detail. To address this, we propose a novel
framework that decomposes the intractable ELQ-to-HQ restoration process. We
first learn a projector that maps an ELQ image onto an intermediate,
less-degraded LQ manifold. This intermediate image is then restored to HQ using
a frozen, off-the-shelf BIR model. Our approach is grounded in information
theory; we provide a novel perspective of image restoration as an Information
Bottleneck problem and derive a theoretically-driven objective to train our
projector. This loss function effectively stabilizes training by balancing a
low-quality reconstruction term with a high-quality prior-matching term. Our
framework enables Look Forward Once (LFO) for inference-time prompt refinement,
and supports plug-and-play strengthening of existing image restoration models
without need for finetuning. Extensive experiments under severe degradation
regimes provide a thorough analysis of the effectiveness of our work.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在陶瓷制造中，无损检测对于确保组件质量至关重要，但传统方法可能效率较低。光学相干断层扫描（OCT）能够提供高分辨率内部成像，但需要自动化方法来识别孔隙、分层和夹杂物等缺陷。

Method: 开发了基于U-Net架构的神经网络，使用手动分割标注的OCT图像进行训练。评估了多种实验配置以提升性能，并采用后处理技术进行定量和定性评估。

Conclusion: 该系统能够高效、可靠地检测夹杂物等缺陷，为陶瓷制造提供了自动化的质量控制解决方案。

Abstract: Non-destructive testing (NDT) is essential in ceramic manufacturing to ensure
the quality of components without compromising their integrity. In this
context, Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) enables high-resolution internal
imaging, revealing defects such as pores, delaminations, or inclusions. This
paper presents an automatic defect detection system based on Deep Learning
(DL), trained on OCT images with manually segmented annotations. A neural
network based on the U-Net architecture is developed, evaluating multiple
experimental configurations to enhance its performance. Post-processing
techniques enable both quantitative and qualitative evaluation of the
predictions. The system shows an accurate behavior of 0.979 Dice Score,
outperforming comparable studies. The inference time of 18.98 seconds per
volume supports its viability for detecting inclusions, enabling more
efficient, reliable, and automated quality control.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺乏能够同时满足人类判断对齐、长序列处理、推理效率和多目标评分适用性等关键属性的综合基准和评估预测器，阻碍了可靠视觉语言应用的发展。

Method: 采用即插即用架构，在大型视觉语言模型顶部构建奖励头，通过在预训练LVLM的冻结隐藏状态上训练轻量级岭回归层来生成细粒度的多目标分数。

Result: MULTI-TAP在不同LVLM架构上表现稳健，性能显著优于现有指标，与GPT-4o相当但模型更小（7-8B），在多目标基准和新发布的EYE4ALL数据集上优于VisionREWARD。

Conclusion: MULTI-TAP提供了一个强大的图像-文本对齐评估解决方案，新发布的EYE4ALL数据集为开发更易访问的AI系统奠定了基础，特别是考虑了盲人和低视力用户的需求。

Abstract: Evaluating image-text alignment while reflecting human preferences across
multiple aspects is a significant issue for the development of reliable
vision-language applications. It becomes especially crucial in real-world
scenarios where multiple valid descriptions exist depending on contexts or user
needs. However, research progress is hindered by the lack of comprehensive
benchmarks and existing evaluation predictors lacking at least one of these key
properties: (1) Alignment with human judgments, (2) Long-sequence processing,
(3) Inference efficiency, and (4) Applicability to multi-objective scoring. To
address these challenges, we propose a plug-and-play architecture to build a
robust predictor, MULTI-TAP (Multi-Objective Task-Aware Predictor), capable of
both multi and single-objective scoring. MULTI-TAP can produce a single overall
score, utilizing a reward head built on top of a large vision-language model
(LVLMs). We show that MULTI-TAP is robust in terms of application to different
LVLM architectures, achieving significantly higher performance than existing
metrics and even on par with the GPT-4o-based predictor, G-VEval, with a
smaller size (7-8B). By training a lightweight ridge regression layer on the
frozen hidden states of a pre-trained LVLM, MULTI-TAP can produce fine-grained
scores for multiple human-interpretable objectives. MULTI-TAP performs better
than VisionREWARD, a high-performing multi-objective reward model, in both
performance and efficiency on multi-objective benchmarks and our newly released
text-image-to-text dataset, EYE4ALL. Our new dataset, consisting of
chosen/rejected human preferences (EYE4ALLPref) and human-annotated
fine-grained scores across seven dimensions (EYE4ALLMulti), can serve as a
foundation for developing more accessible AI systems by capturing the
underlying preferences of users, including blind and low-vision (BLV)
individuals.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种零查询黑盒对抗攻击方法ZQBA，利用深度神经网络的特征图生成对抗样本，无需多次查询或训练扩散模型，就能在不同模型和数据集间实现攻击迁移。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有黑盒对抗攻击方法需要多次查询或训练扩散模型来生成对抗样本，这在现实场景中应用受限。因此需要开发一种无需查询的对抗攻击方法。

Method: 使用深度神经网络的特征图，将其添加到干净图像中，从而破坏目标模型的分类性能。该方法无需多次查询即可生成欺骗性对抗样本。

Result: ZQBA能够在不同模型（CIFAR和Tiny ImageNet数据集）之间成功转移对抗样本，在单次查询下比现有最先进的黑盒攻击更有效，同时保持扰动的不可感知性。

Conclusion: 该方法强调了深度神经网络在现实世界应用中的脆弱性，提供了一种高效且实用的对抗攻击解决方案。

Abstract: Current black-box adversarial attacks either require multiple queries or
diffusion models to produce adversarial samples that can impair the target
model performance. However, these methods require training a surrogate loss or
diffusion models to produce adversarial samples, which limits their
applicability in real-world settings. Thus, we propose a Zero Query Black-box
Adversarial (ZQBA) attack that exploits the representations of Deep Neural
Networks (DNNs) to fool other networks. Instead of requiring thousands of
queries to produce deceiving adversarial samples, we use the feature maps
obtained from a DNN and add them to clean images to impair the classification
of a target model. The results suggest that ZQBA can transfer the adversarial
samples to different models and across various datasets, namely CIFAR and Tiny
ImageNet. The experiments also show that ZQBA is more effective than
state-of-the-art black-box attacks with a single query, while maintaining the
imperceptibility of perturbations, evaluated both quantitatively (SSIM) and
qualitatively, emphasizing the vulnerabilities of employing DNNs in real-world
contexts. All the source code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统概念瓶颈模型在提供语义可解释性的同时，往往牺牲预测性能，且概念预测到最终标签决策的不确定性传播问题尚未充分探索。

Method: 学习一组二元类级概念原型，使用预测概念向量与每个类原型之间的距离作为分类分数和不确定性度量，这些原型同时作为可解释的分类规则。

Result: 提出的框架通过基于学习到的二元类级概念原型对不确定或异常输入的偏离进行保形预测，增强了可解释性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该方法在保持概念瓶颈模型可解释性的同时，提升了分类性能并有效量化了不确定性，为不确定或异常输入提供了更好的处理机制。

Abstract: In the context of image classification, Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs)
first embed images into a set of human-understandable concepts, followed by an
intrinsically interpretable classifier that predicts labels based on these
intermediate representations. While CBMs offer a semantically meaningful and
interpretable classification pipeline, they often sacrifice predictive
performance compared to end-to-end convolutional neural networks. Moreover, the
propagation of uncertainty from concept predictions to final label decisions
remains underexplored. In this paper, we propose a novel uncertainty-aware and
interpretable classifier for the second stage of CBMs. Our method learns a set
of binary class-level concept prototypes and uses the distances between
predicted concept vectors and each class prototype as both a classification
score and a measure of uncertainty. These prototypes also serve as
interpretable classification rules, indicating which concepts should be present
in an image to justify a specific class prediction. The proposed framework
enhances both interpretability and robustness by enabling conformal prediction
for uncertain or outlier inputs based on their deviation from the learned
binary class-level concept prototypes.

TL;DR: 提出MetaLogic评估框架，通过生成语义相同但语法不同的提示词对，检测文本到图像模型在语义一致性方面的对齐失败问题，无需依赖真实图像。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到图像模型在输入提示词发生微小语言变化时难以保持语义一致性，暴露了模型推理和泛化能力的鲁棒性不足。

Method: 利用蜕变测试生成语法不同但语义相同的提示词对，直接比较生成的图像对，识别语义不一致性，并分类对齐错误类型。

Result: 评估多个最先进的T2I模型，发现Flux.dev和DALLE-3分别有59%和71%的对齐失败率，揭示了现有模型普遍存在的鲁棒性问题。

Conclusion: MetaLogic提供了一种可扩展、无需真实图像的评估方法，能有效发现现有评估指标忽略的细粒度逻辑不一致问题，可用于模型调试和改进。

Abstract: Recent advances in text-to-image (T2I) models, especially diffusion-based
architectures, have significantly improved the visual quality of generated
images. However, these models continue to struggle with a critical limitation:
maintaining semantic consistency when input prompts undergo minor linguistic
variations. Despite being logically equivalent, such prompt pairs often yield
misaligned or semantically inconsistent images, exposing a lack of robustness
in reasoning and generalisation. To address this, we propose MetaLogic, a novel
evaluation framework that detects T2I misalignment without relying on ground
truth images. MetaLogic leverages metamorphic testing, generating image pairs
from prompts that differ grammatically but are semantically identical. By
directly comparing these image pairs, the framework identifies inconsistencies
that signal failures in preserving the intended meaning, effectively diagnosing
robustness issues in the model's logic understanding. Unlike existing
evaluation methods that compare a generated image to a single prompt, MetaLogic
evaluates semantic equivalence between paired images, offering a scalable,
ground-truth-free approach to identifying alignment failures. It categorises
these alignment errors (e.g., entity omission, duplication, positional
misalignment) and surfaces counterexamples that can be used for model debugging
and refinement. We evaluate MetaLogic across multiple state-of-the-art T2I
models and reveal consistent robustness failures across a range of logical
constructs. We find that even the SOTA text-to-image models like Flux.dev and
DALLE-3 demonstrate a 59 percent and 71 percent misalignment rate,
respectively. Our results show that MetaLogic is not only efficient and
scalable, but also effective in uncovering fine-grained logical inconsistencies
that are overlooked by existing evaluation metrics.

Abstract: Building facades represent a significant untapped resource for solar energy
generation in dense urban environments, yet assessing their photovoltaic (PV)
potential remains challenging due to complex geometries and semantic com
ponents. This study introduces SF-SPA (Semantic Facade Solar-PV Assessment), an
automated framework that transforms street-view photographs into quantitative
PV deployment assessments. The approach combines com puter vision and
artificial intelligence techniques to address three key challenges: perspective
distortion correction, semantic understanding of facade elements, and spatial
reasoning for PV layout optimization. Our four-stage pipeline processes images
through geometric rectification, zero-shot semantic segmentation, Large
Language Model (LLM) guided spatial reasoning, and energy simulation.
Validation across 80 buildings in four countries demonstrates ro bust
performance with mean area estimation errors of 6.2% &#177; 2.8% compared to
expert annotations. The auto mated assessment requires approximately 100
seconds per building, a substantial gain in efficiency over manual methods.
Simulated energy yield predictions confirm the method's reliability and
applicability for regional poten tial studies, urban energy planning, and
building-integrated photovoltaic (BIPV) deployment. Code is available at:

TL;DR: 提出了ADQA基准测试，用于评估在长视频片段上的音频描述质量，发现现有自动生成方法与人工撰写存在较大差距


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有音频描述生成研究主要关注短片段，且评估时只与单一参考对比，忽略了音频描述的主观性本质

Method: 通过分析同一电影的两个独立音频描述轨道来量化主观性，并创建ADQA基准测试，包含视觉欣赏和叙事理解两类问题

Result: 当前音频描述生成方法在长视频片段上的表现远不如人工撰写的音频描述

Conclusion: 提出了未来工作的建议并建立了公开排行榜，强调需要在更长的连贯视频片段上评估音频描述质量

Abstract: Audio descriptions (ADs) narrate important visual details in movies, enabling
Blind and Low Vision (BLV) users to understand narratives and appreciate visual
details. Existing works in automatic AD generation mostly focus on few-second
trimmed clips, and evaluate them by comparing against a single ground-truth
reference AD. However, writing ADs is inherently subjective. Through alignment
and analysis of two independent AD tracks for the same movies, we quantify the
subjectivity in when and whether to describe, and what and how to highlight.
Thus, we show that working with trimmed clips is inadequate. We propose ADQA, a
QA benchmark that evaluates ADs at the level of few-minute long, coherent video
segments, testing whether they would help BLV users understand the story and
appreciate visual details. ADQA features visual appreciation (VA) questions
about visual facts and narrative understanding (NU) questions based on the
plot. Through ADQA, we show that current AD generation methods lag far behind
human-authored ADs. We conclude with several recommendations for future work
and introduce a public leaderboard for benchmarking.

Conclusion: PhraseStereo数据集将短语定位引入立体视觉领域，为利用深度线索进行更精确的多模态学习提供了新的挑战和机遇，推动了语义和几何联合推理模型的发展。

Abstract: Understanding how natural language phrases correspond to specific regions in
images is a key challenge in multimodal semantic segmentation. Recent advances
in phrase grounding are largely limited to single-view images, neglecting the
rich geometric cues available in stereo vision. For this, we introduce
PhraseStereo, the first novel dataset that brings phrase-region segmentation to
stereo image pairs. PhraseStereo builds upon the PhraseCut dataset by
leveraging GenStereo to generate accurate right-view images from existing
single-view data, enabling the extension of phrase grounding into the stereo
domain. This new setting introduces unique challenges and opportunities for
multimodal learning, particularly in leveraging depth cues for more precise and
context-aware grounding. By providing stereo image pairs with aligned
segmentation masks and phrase annotations, PhraseStereo lays the foundation for
future research at the intersection of language, vision, and 3D perception,
encouraging the development of models that can reason jointly over semantics
and geometry. The PhraseStereo dataset will be released online upon acceptance
of this work.

*Xiangtao Kong,Rongyuan Wu,Shuaizheng Liu,Lingchen Sun,Lei Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于视觉自回归模型的真实图像超分辨率框架NSARM，通过两阶段训练实现高效且高质量的超分辨率重建，在保持快速推理的同时显著提升了输入图像质量变化的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有真实图像超分辨率方法存在效率与质量的权衡问题：基于扩散模型的方法要么生成质量高但速度慢，要么速度快但质量低。现有方法通常固定预训练模型只训练额外模块，容易产生过增强伪影和幻觉，对输入图像质量变化的鲁棒性较差。

Method: 基于视觉自回归模型的next-scale预测策略，提出NSARM框架。采用两阶段训练：首先训练转换网络将低质量图像映射到初步尺度，然后进行端到端的全模型微调。这种全面的微调增强了模型在真实图像超分辨率任务中的鲁棒性。

Result: 广泛的定量和定性评估表明，NSARM作为纯自回归模型，在保持快速推理速度的同时，实现了优于现有真实图像超分辨率方法的视觉效果。最重要的是，它对输入图像质量表现出更高的鲁棒性和更强的泛化性能。

Conclusion: NSARM框架成功解决了真实图像超分辨率中效率与质量的权衡问题，通过两阶段训练策略实现了高质量重建和强鲁棒性的平衡，为视觉自回归模型在超分辨率任务中的应用提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Most recent real-world image super-resolution (Real-ISR) methods employ
pre-trained text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models to synthesize the high-quality
image either from random Gaussian noise, which yields realistic results but is
slow due to iterative denoising, or directly from the input low-quality image,
which is efficient but at the price of lower output quality. These approaches
train ControlNet or LoRA modules while keeping the pre-trained model fixed,
which often introduces over-enhanced artifacts and hallucinations, suffering
from the robustness to inputs of varying degradations. Recent visual
autoregressive (AR) models, such as pre-trained Infinity, can provide strong
T2I generation capabilities while offering superior efficiency by using the
bitwise next-scale prediction strategy. Building upon next-scale prediction, we
introduce a robust Real-ISR framework, namely Next-Scale Autoregressive
Modeling (NSARM). Specifically, we train NSARM in two stages: a transformation
network is first trained to map the input low-quality image to preliminary
scales, followed by an end-to-end full-model fine-tuning. Such a comprehensive
fine-tuning enhances the robustness of NSARM in Real-ISR tasks without
compromising its generative capability. Extensive quantitative and qualitative
evaluations demonstrate that as a pure AR model, NSARM achieves superior visual
results over existing Real-ISR methods while maintaining a fast inference
speed. Most importantly, it demonstrates much higher robustness to the quality
of input images, showing stronger generalization performance. Project page:

Motivation: 传统分类方法往往忽略不同层次类别间的内在关系，从而丢失重要的监督信号。

Method: 提出了两种层次对比学习方法：基于高斯混合模型的G-HMLC和基于注意力机制的A-HMLC，明确建模类间关系和层次间的不平衡分布。

Result: 在CIFAR100和ModelNet40数据集上，线性评估准确率比现有层次对比学习方法高出2个百分点。

Conclusion: 该方法通过定量和定性结果验证了有效性，在计算机视觉等领域具有应用潜力。

Abstract: Hierarchical classification is a crucial task in many applications, where
objects are organized into multiple levels of categories. However, conventional
classification approaches often neglect inherent inter-class relationships at
different hierarchy levels, thus missing important supervisory signals. Thus,
we propose two novel hierarchical contrastive learning (HMLC) methods. The
first, leverages a Gaussian Mixture Model (G-HMLC) and the second uses an
attention mechanism to capture hierarchy-specific features (A-HMLC), imitating
human processing. Our approach explicitly models inter-class relationships and
imbalanced class distribution at higher hierarchy levels, enabling fine-grained
clustering across all hierarchy levels. On the competitive CIFAR100 and
ModelNet40 datasets, our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in linear
evaluation, outperforming existing hierarchical contrastive learning methods by
2 percentage points in terms of accuracy. The effectiveness of our approach is
backed by both quantitative and qualitative results, highlighting its potential
for applications in computer vision and beyond.

Motivation: 随着视频生成模型的强大发展，研究它们是否能替代传统视觉编码器范式进行通用多模态理解，探索世界模型先验在视觉语言模型中的潜力。

Method: 重新利用视频扩散模型作为生成编码器，执行单步去噪并将结果潜在表示作为视觉嵌入，构建World-Language Models框架。

Conclusion: 世界模型从视频预训练中继承的运动一致性内部化带来了性能增益，为利用世界模型先验的新型视觉语言模型家族铺平了道路。

Abstract: Trained on internet-scale video data, generative world models are
increasingly recognized as powerful world simulators that can generate
consistent and plausible dynamics over structure, motion, and physics. This
raises a natural question: with the advent of strong video foundational models,
might they supplant conventional vision encoder paradigms for general-purpose
multimodal understanding? While recent studies have begun to explore the
potential of world models on common vision tasks, these explorations typically
lack a systematic investigation of generic, multimodal tasks. In this work, we
strive to investigate the capabilities when world model priors are transferred
into Vision-Language Models: we re-purpose a video diffusion model as a
generative encoder to perform a single denoising step and treat the resulting
latents as a set of visual embedding. We empirically investigate this class of
models, which we refer to as World-Language Models (WorldLMs), and we find that
generative encoders can capture latents useful for downstream understanding
that show distinctions from conventional encoders. Naming our best-performing
variant Dynamic Vision Aligner (DyVA), we further discover that this method
significantly enhances spatial reasoning abilities and enables single-image
models to perform multi-frame reasoning. Through the curation of a suite of
visual reasoning tasks, we find DyVA to surpass both open-source and
proprietary baselines, achieving state-of-the-art or comparable performance. We
attribute these gains to WorldLM's inherited motion-consistency internalization
from video pre-training. Finally, we systematically explore extensive model
designs to highlight promising directions for future work. We hope our study
can pave the way for a new family of VLMs that leverage priors from world
models and are on a promising path towards generalist vision learners.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合移位窗口自注意力和Mamba选择性扫描的混合架构，用于视频超分辨率任务，通过Gather-Scatter Mamba机制减少遮挡伪影并提升时空建模能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RNN在视频超分辨率中存在梯度消失、缺乏并行性和推理速度慢的问题，而Transformer虽然能建模全局上下文但计算复杂度高。Mamba提供了线性时间复杂度的选择性状态空间模型，但缺乏细粒度空间依赖建模能力。

Method: 提出混合架构：1) 移位窗口自注意力用于空间上下文聚合；2) Mamba选择性扫描用于高效时间传播；3) Gather-Scatter Mamba机制在Mamba传播前后进行特征对齐，减少遮挡伪影。

Result: 该方法在视频超分辨率任务中表现出色，能够有效处理长序列，同时保持高效的推理速度。

Conclusion: 结合自注意力和选择性状态空间模型的混合架构能够充分利用两者的优势，在视频超分辨率中实现高效的时空建模。

Abstract: State Space Models (SSMs)-most notably RNNs-have historically played a
central role in sequential modeling. Although attention mechanisms such as
Transformers have since dominated due to their ability to model global context,
their quadratic complexity and limited scalability make them less suited for
long sequences. Video super-resolution (VSR) methods have traditionally relied
on recurrent architectures to propagate features across frames. However, such
approaches suffer from well-known issues including vanishing gradients, lack of
parallelism, and slow inference speed. Recent advances in selective SSMs like
Mamba offer a compelling alternative: by enabling input-dependent state
transitions with linear-time complexity, Mamba mitigates these issues while
maintaining strong long-range modeling capabilities. Despite this potential,
Mamba alone struggles to capture fine-grained spatial dependencies due to its
causal nature and lack of explicit context aggregation. To address this, we
propose a hybrid architecture that combines shifted window self-attention for
spatial context aggregation with Mamba-based selective scanning for efficient
temporal propagation. Furthermore, we introduce Gather-Scatter Mamba (GSM), an
alignment-aware mechanism that warps features toward a center anchor frame
within the temporal window before Mamba propagation and scatters them back
afterward, effectively reducing occlusion artifacts and ensuring effective
redistribution of aggregated information across all frames. The official
implementation is provided at: https://github.com/Ko-Lani/GSMamba.

Motivation: 传统将3D OCT体积压缩为2D报告的做法会导致关键结构细节丢失，需要开发能够保留3D信息并提高诊断准确性的方法。

Method: 使用交叉注意力机制的3D CNN模型，将体积沿两个轴分割并应用交叉注意力，捕获半视网膜区域间的不对称性，同时整合视神经头和黄斑信息。引入CAREs可视化注意力输出，并与Grad-CAMs对齐进行多任务微调。

Conclusion: AI-CNet3D模型在保持高诊断性能的同时，显著提高了计算效率和解剖一致性，为青光眼诊断提供了有效的3D OCT分析方法。

Abstract: Glaucoma is a progressive eye disease that leads to optic nerve damage,
causing irreversible vision loss if left untreated. Optical coherence
tomography (OCT) has become a crucial tool for glaucoma diagnosis, offering
high-resolution 3D scans of the retina and optic nerve. However, the
conventional practice of condensing information from 3D OCT volumes into 2D
reports often results in the loss of key structural details. To address this,
we propose a novel hybrid deep learning model that integrates cross-attention
mechanisms into a 3D convolutional neural network (CNN), enabling the
extraction of critical features from the superior and inferior hemiretinas, as
well as from the optic nerve head (ONH) and macula, within OCT volumes. We
introduce Channel Attention REpresentations (CAREs) to visualize
cross-attention outputs and leverage them for consistency-based multi-task
fine-tuning, aligning them with Gradient-Weighted Class Activation Maps
(Grad-CAMs) from the CNN's final convolutional layer to enhance performance,
interpretability, and anatomical coherence. We have named this model AI-CNet3D
(AI-`See'-Net3D) to reflect its design as an Anatomically-Informed
Cross-attention Network operating on 3D data. By dividing the volume along two
axes and applying cross-attention, our model enhances glaucoma classification
by capturing asymmetries between the hemiretinal regions while integrating
information from the optic nerve head and macula. We validate our approach on
two large datasets, showing that it outperforms state-of-the-art attention and
convolutional models across all key metrics. Finally, our model is
computationally efficient, reducing the parameter count by one-hundred--fold
compared to other attention mechanisms while maintaining high diagnostic
performance and comparable GFLOPS.

Motivation: 3D面部扫描的手动标注耗时且依赖专业知识，现有的深度学习方法大多关注伪标志点或需要复杂输入表示，限制了临床适用性。

Method: 结合粗对齐、感兴趣区域过滤和初始标志点近似，使用基于补丁的点式CNN并增强注意力机制。

Result: 在214个标注扫描上达到3.686 mm的平均定位误差，在FaceScape数据集700个受试者上达到0.41 mm点误差和0.38 mm距离误差，性能优于现有方法。

Conclusion: PAL-Net提供了一个轻量级、可扩展的高通量3D人体测量分析解决方案，有潜力支持临床工作流程并减少对手动标注的依赖。

Abstract: Manual annotation of anatomical landmarks on 3D facial scans is a
time-consuming and expertise-dependent task, yet it remains critical for
clinical assessments, morphometric analysis, and craniofacial research. While
several deep learning methods have been proposed for facial landmark
localization, most focus on pseudo-landmarks or require complex input
representations, limiting their clinical applicability. This study presents a
fully automated deep learning pipeline (PAL-Net) for localizing 50 anatomical
landmarks on stereo-photogrammetry facial models. The method combines coarse
alignment, region-of-interest filtering, and an initial approximation of
landmarks with a patch-based pointwise CNN enhanced by attention mechanisms.
Trained and evaluated on 214 annotated scans from healthy adults, PAL-Net
achieved a mean localization error of 3.686 mm and preserves relevant
anatomical distances with a 2.822 mm average error, comparable to
intra-observer variability. To assess generalization, the model was further
evaluated on 700 subjects from the FaceScape dataset, achieving a point-wise
error of 0.41\,mm and a distance-wise error of 0.38\,mm. Compared to existing
methods, PAL-Net offers a favorable trade-off between accuracy and
computational cost. While performance degrades in regions with poor mesh
quality (e.g., ears, hairline), the method demonstrates consistent accuracy
across most anatomical regions. PAL-Net generalizes effectively across datasets
and facial regions, outperforming existing methods in both point-wise and
structural evaluations. It provides a lightweight, scalable solution for
high-throughput 3D anthropometric analysis, with potential to support clinical
workflows and reduce reliance on manual annotation. Source code can be found at

Abstract: Self-supervised learning for inverse problems allows to train a
reconstruction network from noise and/or incomplete data alone. These methods
have the potential of enabling learning-based solutions when obtaining
ground-truth references for training is expensive or even impossible. In this
paper, we propose a new self-supervised learning strategy devised for the
challenging setting where measurements are observed via a single incomplete
observation model. We introduce a new definition of equivariance in the context
of reconstruction networks, and show that the combination of self-supervised
splitting losses and equivariant reconstruction networks results in unbiased
estimates of the supervised loss. Through a series of experiments on image
inpainting, accelerated magnetic resonance imaging, and compressive sensing, we
demonstrate that the proposed loss achieves state-of-the-art performance in
settings with highly rank-deficient forward models.

Conclusion: 基于本文新发现的模型展示了有效性和优越性，为跨分辨率行人重识别提供了新的解决思路。

Abstract: In surveillance scenarios, varying camera distances cause significant
differences among pedestrian image resolutions, making it hard to match
low-resolution (LR) images with high-resolution (HR) counterparts, limiting the
performance of Re-Identification (ReID) tasks. Most existing Cross-Resolution
ReID (CR-ReID) methods rely on super-resolution (SR) or joint learning for
feature compensation, which increases training and inference complexity and has
reached a performance bottleneck in recent studies. Inspired by semantic
directions in the word embedding space, we empirically discover that semantic
directions implying resolution differences also emerge in the feature space of
ReID, and we substantiate this finding from a statistical perspective using
Canonical Correlation Analysis and Pearson Correlation Analysis. Based on this
interesting finding, we propose a lightweight and effective Vector Panning
Feature Alignment (VPFA) framework, which conducts CR-ReID from a novel
perspective of modeling the resolution-specific feature discrepancy. Extensive
experimental results on multiple CR-ReID benchmarks show that our method
significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art baseline models while
obtaining higher efficiency, demonstrating the effectiveness and superiority of
our model based on the new finding in this paper.

Motivation: 现有视频超分辨率方法在处理长序列时面临两个主要挑战：多步去噪导致的效率低下，以及时间分解引起的伪影和不连续性。

Method: 将预训练的DiT适配为因果结构，通过滚动KV缓存和联合视觉引导保持局部和全局一致性；将扩散过程蒸馏为单步，采用补丁级像素监督和跨块分布匹配。

Conclusion: InfVSR突破了长视频超分辨率的限制，实现了高效可扩展的处理，并建立了专门的长视频评估基准。

Abstract: Real-world videos often extend over thousands of frames. Existing video
super-resolution (VSR) approaches, however, face two persistent challenges when
processing long sequences: (1) inefficiency due to the heavy cost of multi-step
denoising for full-length sequences; and (2) poor scalability hindered by
temporal decomposition that causes artifacts and discontinuities. To break
these limits, we propose InfVSR, which novelly reformulates VSR as an
autoregressive-one-step-diffusion paradigm. This enables streaming inference
while fully leveraging pre-trained video diffusion priors. First, we adapt the
pre-trained DiT into a causal structure, maintaining both local and global
coherence via rolling KV-cache and joint visual guidance. Second, we distill
the diffusion process into a single step efficiently, with patch-wise pixel
supervision and cross-chunk distribution matching. Together, these designs
enable efficient and scalable VSR for unbounded-length videos. To fill the gap
in long-form video evaluation, we build a new benchmark tailored for extended
sequences and further introduce semantic-level metrics to comprehensively
assess temporal consistency. Our method pushes the frontier of long-form VSR,
achieves state-of-the-art quality with enhanced semantic consistency, and
delivers up to 58x speed-up over existing methods such as MGLD-VSR. Code will
be available at https://github.com/Kai-Liu001/InfVSR.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: JEPA-T是一个统一的多模态框架，通过联合嵌入预测Transformer处理视觉和文本token，结合交叉注意力和原始文本嵌入注入，在保持任务无关主干的同时增强文本-图像融合，实现高效的条件图像生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代文本到图像生成主要依赖基于token的架构，但文本与视觉token的有效融合仍然是一个挑战。需要平衡条件强度与主干通用性。

Method: 将图像和标题编码为离散token，使用联合嵌入预测Transformer处理，加入交叉注意力进行条件去噪，在流匹配损失前注入原始文本嵌入以改善对齐。

Result: 在ImageNet-1K上的评估显示，JEPA-T实现了强大的数据效率、开放词汇泛化能力，并持续优于非融合和后期融合基线方法。

Conclusion: 后期架构融合与目标级对齐相结合，在基于token的文本到图像生成中提供了条件强度与主干通用性之间的有效平衡。

Abstract: Modern Text-to-Image (T2I) generation increasingly relies on token-centric
architectures that are trained with self-supervision, yet effectively fusing
text with visual tokens remains a challenge. We propose \textbf{JEPA-T}, a
unified multimodal framework that encodes images and captions into discrete
visual and textual tokens, processed by a joint-embedding predictive
Transformer. To enhance fusion, we incorporate cross-attention after the
feature predictor for conditional denoising while maintaining a task-agnostic
backbone. Additionally, raw texts embeddings are injected prior to the flow
matching loss to improve alignment during training. During inference, the same
network performs both class-conditional and free-text image generation by
iteratively denoising visual tokens conditioned on text. Evaluations on
ImageNet-1K demonstrate that JEPA-T achieves strong data efficiency,
open-vocabulary generalization, and consistently outperforms non-fusion and
late-fusion baselines. Our approach shows that late architectural fusion
combined with objective-level alignment offers an effective balance between
conditioning strength and backbone generality in token-based T2I.The code is
now available: https://github.com/justin-herry/JEPA-T.git

TL;DR: FastForward是一种单次前向传播的视觉定位方法，能够在极短时间内完成地图构建和查询图像定位，无需传统方法所需的长时间地图准备过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉定位方法即使从已知相机姿态的映射图像开始，仍需要数小时到数分钟的地图构建时间。本研究旨在探索是否能在更短时间内达到竞争性的定位精度。

Method: 将多个映射图像表示为3D空间中锚定的特征集合，利用这些映射特征预测查询图像与场景的对应关系，从而估计相机姿态。结合图像检索技术实现快速定位。

Result: 与需要最小地图准备时间的其他方法相比，FastForward达到了最先进的精度水平，并且在未见过的领域（包括具有挑战性的大规模室外环境）展现出强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: FastForward证明了通过单次前向传播实现快速而准确的视觉定位是可行的，为实时定位系统提供了新的可能性。

Abstract: Visually localizing an image, i.e., estimating its camera pose, requires
building a scene representation that serves as a visual map. The representation
we choose has direct consequences towards the practicability of our system.
Even when starting from mapping images with known camera poses,
state-of-the-art approaches still require hours of mapping time in the worst
case, and several minutes in the best. This work raises the question whether we
can achieve competitive accuracy much faster. We introduce FastForward, a
method that creates a map representation and relocalizes a query image
on-the-fly in a single feed-forward pass. At the core, we represent multiple
mapping images as a collection of features anchored in 3D space. FastForward
utilizes these mapping features to predict image-to-scene correspondences for
the query image, enabling the estimation of its camera pose. We couple
FastForward with image retrieval and achieve state-of-the-art accuracy when
compared to other approaches with minimal map preparation time. Furthermore,
FastForward demonstrates robust generalization to unseen domains, including
challenging large-scale outdoor environments.

Motivation: 自回归模型在视觉语言数据建模中存在空间视觉信号与顺序依赖预测之间的冲突，导致次优结果。

Method: 设计了一个后预训练的精炼模块，利用全局上下文和标记间关系来联合精炼自回归模型生成的所有标记。

Result: 实验表明该方法提高了生成质量，增强了模型产生语义一致结果的能力。

Conclusion: 该精炼模块有效缓解了顺序生成中的错误累积问题，在共享顺序预测框架下提升了视觉语言建模性能。

Abstract: Autoregressive models excel in sequential modeling and have proven to be
effective for vision-language data. However, the spatial nature of visual
signals conflicts with the sequential dependencies of next-token prediction,
leading to suboptimal results. This work proposes a plug-and-play refinement
module to enhance the complex spatial correspondence modeling within the
generated visual sequence. This module operates as a post-pretraining step to
jointly refine all generated tokens of autoregressive model, enhancing
vision-language modeling under a shared sequential prediction framework. By
leveraging global context and relationship across the tokens, our method
mitigates the error accumulation issue within the sequential generation.
Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method improves the generation
quality, enhancing the model's ability to produce semantically consistent
results.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了SoftCFG方法，解决自回归模型中分类器自由引导的两个关键问题：引导衰减和过度引导，通过不确定性加权扰动和步长归一化来提升图像生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自回归模型在图像生成中应用分类器自由引导时面临引导衰减（条件-无条件差距快速消失）和过度引导（强条件破坏视觉连贯性）的问题。

Method: 提出SoftCFG方法：1）基于不确定性的自适应扰动分配，让每个生成的token贡献确定性加权的引导；2）引入步长归一化来限制累积扰动，稳定长序列生成。该方法无需训练、模型无关，可直接集成到现有AR流程中。

Result: 实验表明SoftCFG显著优于标准CFG，在ImageNet 256上实现了自回归模型中最先进的FID分数。

Conclusion: SoftCFG有效解决了AR模型中CFG的引导问题，通过不确定性加权和扰动控制提升了条件图像生成的质量和稳定性。

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) models have emerged as powerful tools for image
generation by modeling images as sequences of discrete tokens. While
Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) has been adopted to improve conditional
generation, its application in AR models faces two key issues: guidance
diminishing, where the conditional-unconditional gap quickly vanishes as
decoding progresses, and over-guidance, where strong conditions distort visual
coherence. To address these challenges, we propose SoftCFG, an
uncertainty-guided inference method that distributes adaptive perturbations
across all tokens in the sequence. The key idea behind SoftCFG is to let each
generated token contribute certainty-weighted guidance, ensuring that the
signal persists across steps while resolving conflicts between text guidance
and visual context. To further stabilize long-sequence generation, we introduce
Step Normalization, which bounds cumulative perturbations of SoftCFG. Our
method is training-free, model-agnostic, and seamlessly integrates with
existing AR pipelines. Experiments show that SoftCFG significantly improves
image quality over standard CFG and achieves state-of-the-art FID on ImageNet
256 among autoregressive models.

*Qiming Zhao,Xingjian Li,Xiaoyu Cao,Xiaolong Wu,Min Xu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TextCAM是一个新的可解释性框架，通过将CAM方法与视觉语言模型结合，用自然语言描述图像分类决策的依据，提供语义丰富的解释。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统CAM方法虽然能定位图像中的重要区域，但缺乏对这些区域语义内容的解释，限制了模型在高风险应用中的可信度。

Method: 结合CAM的空间定位能力和CLIP等视觉语言模型的语义对齐能力，通过线性判别分析获取通道级语义表示，并与CAM权重聚合生成文本描述。

Result: 在ImageNet、CLEVR和CUB数据集上的实验表明，TextCAM能产生忠实且可解释的推理，提高人类理解能力，检测虚假相关性，并保持模型保真度。

Conclusion: TextCAM通过融合空间定位和语义描述，为深度视觉模型提供了更全面的解释能力，增强了模型的可信度和透明度。

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have achieved remarkable success across domains
but remain difficult to interpret, limiting their trustworthiness in
high-stakes applications. This paper focuses on deep vision models, for which a
dominant line of explainability methods are Class Activation Mapping (CAM) and
its variants working by highlighting spatial regions that drive predictions. We
figure out that CAM provides little semantic insight into what attributes
underlie these activations. To address this limitation, we propose TextCAM, a
novel explanation framework that enriches CAM with natural languages. TextCAM
combines the precise spatial localization of CAM with the semantic alignment of
vision-language models (VLMs). Specifically, we derive channel-level semantic
representations using CLIP embeddings and linear discriminant analysis, and
aggregate them with CAM weights to produce textual descriptions of salient
visual evidence. This yields explanations that jointly specify where the model
attends and what visual attributes likely support its decision. We further
extend TextCAM to generate feature channels into semantically coherent groups,
enabling more fine-grained visual-textual explanations. Experiments on
ImageNet, CLEVR, and CUB demonstrate that TextCAM produces faithful and
interpretable rationales that improve human understanding, detect spurious
correlations, and preserve model fidelity.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: POVQA是一种数据高效的方法，通过时间池化技术将每秒视频压缩为单帧图像，并利用轻量级监督对齐大型视觉语言模型，显著提升视频问答性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频问答方法虽然能处理1500+帧的长视频，但仅对应50秒内容且信息损失严重。需要更高效的方法来压缩视频信息并提升问答质量。

Method: 使用多种时间池化技术（运动模糊、加权平均等）将视频压缩为1fps输入，在ReasonVQA数据集上对QWEN-2.5-VL 7B模型进行监督微调和直接偏好优化。

Result: 在ReasonVQA数据集上，F1分数从0.212提升至0.543，BLEU-4从0.031提升至0.291，ROUGE-L从0.196提升至0.528，推理质量显著提高。

Conclusion: 该方法在不同池化方案下均表现稳健，在TVQA上的零样本测试也验证了其有效性，表明在时间证据总结方面具有很强的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Video Question Answering (VQA) with Large Vision Language Models (LVLMs) has
gained significant traction in research ever since the Flamingo was introduced
by Deepmind. Recent advancements in large context/long video question answering
have allowed VQA tasks to have context window of 1500+ frames. However, this
only leads to 50 seconds of video footage without losing any significant
information. We introduce POVQA, a data-efficient pipeline that compresses each
second of video into a single temporally pooled image (via motion blur and
weighted averaging variants) and then align LVLMs with lightweight supervision.
Concretely, we build 1 fps input sources using Blend Blur with Last Frame,
Weighted Average, Exponential and Ramp pooling and fine-tune QWEN-2.5-VL 7B
with supervised two turn target including reasoning and final answer. We apply
Supervised Fine Tuning (SFT) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) on our
novel dataset ReasonVQA consisting of 12 movies with 239 human annotated
question-answer with reasoning prompts. On our ReasonVQA dataset, this method
dramatically improves performance over pooled baselines: F1 score improves from
0.212 to 0.543, BLEU-4 from 0.031 to 0.291, and ROUGE-L from 0.196 to 0.528.
Rationale quality also significantly increases. Cross-evaluation of SFT + DPO
on various pooling functions show that the gains persist regardless of the
pooling scheme used at train or test time, indicating strong robustness on
summarization of temporal evidence. Similar observations were made on zero-shot
in TVQA.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常使用单一标量量化生成图像质量，无法提供全面且可解释的反馈。需要更全面的评估框架来支持文本到图像模型的偏好对齐。

Method: 基于视觉语言模型，采用"观察-思考-预测"范式：首先定位潜在缺陷，然后生成推理，最后给出定量评分。通过监督微调和强化学习进行训练。

Result: 在多个数据集上与人类偏好高度一致，作为奖励模型用于偏好调优时，比基于标量的奖励模型提升了10%的生成质量。

Conclusion: ImageDoctor提供了一个统一的多方面评估框架，能够提供全面、可解释的图像质量评估，并有效提升文本到图像模型的生成质量。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of text-to-image (T2I) models has increased the need
for reliable human preference modeling, a demand further amplified by recent
progress in reinforcement learning for preference alignment. However, existing
approaches typically quantify the quality of a generated image using a single
scalar, limiting their ability to provide comprehensive and interpretable
feedback on image quality. To address this, we introduce ImageDoctor, a unified
multi-aspect T2I model evaluation framework that assesses image quality across
four complementary dimensions: plausibility, semantic alignment, aesthetics,
and overall quality. ImageDoctor also provides pixel-level flaw indicators in
the form of heatmaps, which highlight misaligned or implausible regions, and
can be used as a dense reward for T2I model preference alignment. Inspired by
the diagnostic process, we improve the detail sensitivity and reasoning
capability of ImageDoctor by introducing a "look-think-predict" paradigm, where
the model first localizes potential flaws, then generates reasoning, and
finally concludes the evaluation with quantitative scores. Built on top of a
vision-language model and trained through a combination of supervised
fine-tuning and reinforcement learning, ImageDoctor demonstrates strong
alignment with human preference across multiple datasets, establishing its
effectiveness as an evaluation metric. Furthermore, when used as a reward model
for preference tuning, ImageDoctor significantly improves generation quality --
achieving an improvement of 10% over scalar-based reward models.

Method: 引入对抗训练到高光谱领域，提出AT-RA方法，使用数据增强技术增加光谱信息多样性，确保空间平滑性来保护光谱语义信息。

Result: AT-RA将对抗鲁棒性提升21.34%（对抗AutoAttack）和18.78%（对抗PGD-50），同时将良性准确率提升2.68%。

Conclusion: AT-RA方法有效解决了高光谱数据对抗训练中的独特挑战，显著提升了模型的安全性和准确性。

Abstract: Recent studies have revealed that hyperspectral classification models based
on deep learning are highly vulnerable to adversarial attacks, which pose
significant security risks. Although several approaches have attempted to
enhance adversarial robustness by modifying network architectures, these
methods often rely on customized designs that limit scalability and fail to
defend effectively against strong attacks. To address these challenges, we
introduce adversarial training to the hyperspectral domain, which is widely
regarded as one of the most effective defenses against adversarial attacks.
Through extensive empirical analyses, we demonstrate that while adversarial
training does enhance robustness across various models and datasets,
hyperspectral data introduces unique challenges not seen in RGB images.
Specifically, we find that adversarial noise and the non-smooth nature of
adversarial examples can distort or eliminate important spectral semantic
information. To mitigate this issue, we employ data augmentation techniques and
propose a novel hyperspectral adversarial training method, termed AT-RA. By
increasing the diversity of spectral information and ensuring spatial
smoothness, AT-RA preserves and corrects spectral semantics in hyperspectral
images. Experimental results show that AT-RA improves adversarial robustness by
21.34% against AutoAttack and 18.78% against PGD-50 while boosting benign
accuracy by 2.68%.

Conclusion: 提出的方法实现了安全、高质量的可逆人脸匿名化，解决了现有方法在安全性和可逆性之间的权衡问题。

Abstract: Face images processed by computer vision algorithms contain sensitive
personal information that malicious actors can capture without consent. These
privacy and security risks highlight the need for effective face anonymization
methods. Current methods struggle to propose a good trade-off between a secure
scheme with high-quality image generation and reversibility for later person
authentication. Diffusion-based approaches produce high-quality anonymized
images but lack the secret key mechanism to ensure that only authorized parties
can reverse the process. In this paper, we introduce, to our knowledge, the
first secure, high-quality reversible anonymization method based on a diffusion
model. We propose to combine the secret key with the latent faces
representation of the diffusion model. To preserve identity-irrelevant
features, generation is constrained by a facial mask, maintaining high-quality
images. By using a deterministic forward and backward diffusion process, our
approach enforces that the original face can be recovered with the correct
secret key. We also show that the proposed method produces anonymized faces
that are less visually similar to the original faces, compared to other
previous work.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统伪离散扩散方法依赖连续潜在空间扩散或掩码策略，ADD旨在直接在one-hot空间保持扩散特性，弥合判别式与生成式学习之间的鸿沟

Method: 使用浮点编码的one-hot类别数据作为扩散输入，引入时间步条件交叉熵损失，在扩散模型输出与原始one-hot标签之间建立联系

Result: 在分类任务上表现优于基线，在图像描述任务上展现出优秀的文本生成能力，消融实验验证各组件贡献

Conclusion: ADD框架成功实现了真正的离散扩散，在分类和生成任务上均取得优异性能

Abstract: We propose an Authentic Discrete Diffusion (ADD) framework that fundamentally
redefines prior pseudo-discrete approaches by preserving core diffusion
characteristics directly in the one-hot space through a suite of coordinated
mechanisms. Unlike conventional "pseudo" discrete diffusion (PDD) methods, ADD
reformulates the diffusion input by directly using float-encoded one-hot class
data, without relying on diffusing in the continuous latent spaces or masking
policies. At its core, a timestep-conditioned cross-entropy loss is introduced
between the diffusion model's outputs and the original one-hot labels. This
synergistic design establishes a bridge between discriminative and generative
learning. Our experiments demonstrate that ADD not only achieves superior
performance on classification tasks compared to the baseline, but also exhibits
excellent text generation capabilities on Image captioning. Extensive ablations
validate the measurable gains of each component.

Result: 在四个基准测试（包括3D物体分割和复杂查询检索）中，KeySG在大多数指标上优于先前方法，展示了其优越的语义丰富性和效率。

Conclusion: KeySG通过分层图表示和关键帧选择策略，有效解决了3D场景图的语义限制和可扩展性问题，为机器人推理和规划提供了更通用的解决方案。

Abstract: In recent years, 3D scene graphs have emerged as a powerful world
representation, offering both geometric accuracy and semantic richness.
Combining 3D scene graphs with large language models enables robots to reason,
plan, and navigate in complex human-centered environments. However, current
approaches for constructing 3D scene graphs are semantically limited to a
predefined set of relationships, and their serialization in large environments
can easily exceed an LLM's context window. We introduce KeySG, a framework that
represents 3D scenes as a hierarchical graph consisting of floors, rooms,
objects, and functional elements, where nodes are augmented with multi-modal
information extracted from keyframes selected to optimize geometric and visual
coverage. The keyframes allow us to efficiently leverage VLM to extract scene
information, alleviating the need to explicitly model relationship edges
between objects, enabling more general, task-agnostic reasoning and planning.
Our approach can process complex and ambiguous queries while mitigating the
scalability issues associated with large scene graphs by utilizing a
hierarchical retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipeline to extract relevant
context from the graph. Evaluated across four distinct benchmarks -- including
3D object segmentation and complex query retrieval -- KeySG outperforms prior
approaches on most metrics, demonstrating its superior semantic richness and
efficiency.

Abstract: Large vision-language models (VLMs) are increasingly used in
autonomous-vehicle (AV) stacks, but hallucination limits their reliability in
safety-critical pipelines. We present Shapley-credited Context-Aware
Dawid-Skene with Agreement, a game-theoretic fusion method for multi-label
understanding of ego-view dashcam video. It learns per-model, per-label,
context-conditioned reliabilities from labelled history and, at inference,
converts each model's report into an agreement-guardrailed log-likelihood ratio
that is combined with a contextual prior and a public reputation state updated
via Shapley-based team credit. The result is calibrated, thresholdable
posteriors that (i) amplify agreement among reliable models, (ii) preserve
uniquely correct single-model signals, and (iii) adapt to drift. To specialise
general VLMs, we curate 1,000 real-world dashcam clips with structured
annotations (scene description, manoeuvre recommendation, rationale) via an
automatic pipeline that fuses HDD ground truth, vehicle kinematics, and YOLOv11
+ BoT-SORT tracking, guided by a three-step chain-of-thought prompt; three
heterogeneous VLMs are then fine-tuned with LoRA. We evaluate with Hamming
distance, Micro-Macro-F1, and average per-video latency. Empirically, the
proposed method achieves a 23% reduction in Hamming distance, 55% improvement
in Macro-F1, and 47% improvement in Micro-F1 when comparing with the best
single model, supporting VLM fusion as a calibrated, interpretable, and robust
decision-support component for AV pipelines.

Result: 在MMMC基准测试中，Code2Video相比直接代码生成提升了40%的效果，生成的视频质量可与人工制作的教程相媲美，特别是在TeachQuiz指标上表现出色。

Conclusion: Code2Video展示了一种可扩展、可解释且可控的教育视频生成方法，为教育内容创作提供了新的技术路径。

Abstract: While recent generative models advance pixel-space video synthesis, they
remain limited in producing professional educational videos, which demand
disciplinary knowledge, precise visual structures, and coherent transitions,
limiting their applicability in educational scenarios. Intuitively, such
requirements are better addressed through the manipulation of a renderable
environment, which can be explicitly controlled via logical commands (e.g.,
code). In this work, we propose Code2Video, a code-centric agent framework for
generating educational videos via executable Python code. The framework
comprises three collaborative agents: (i) Planner, which structures lecture
content into temporally coherent flows and prepares corresponding visual
assets; (ii) Coder, which converts structured instructions into executable
Python codes while incorporating scope-guided auto-fix to enhance efficiency;
and (iii) Critic, which leverages vision-language models (VLM) with visual
anchor prompts to refine spatial layout and ensure clarity. To support
systematic evaluation, we build MMMC, a benchmark of professionally produced,
discipline-specific educational videos. We evaluate MMMC across diverse
dimensions, including VLM-as-a-Judge aesthetic scores, code efficiency, and
particularly, TeachQuiz, a novel end-to-end metric that quantifies how well a
VLM, after unlearning, can recover knowledge by watching the generated videos.
Our results demonstrate the potential of Code2Video as a scalable,
interpretable, and controllable approach, achieving 40% improvement over direct
code generation and producing videos comparable to human-crafted tutorials. The
code and datasets are available at https://github.com/showlab/Code2Video.

TL;DR: EvoWorld是一个结合全景视频生成与演化3D记忆的世界模型，能够实现空间一致的长时程环境探索。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受人类在先前体验过的3D环境中进行心理探索和回放能力的启发，旨在实现空间一致的长时程探索。

Method: 首先通过具有精细视图控制的视频生成器生成未来视频帧，然后使用前馈即插即用transformer演化场景的3D重建，最后基于这个演化的显式3D记忆的几何重投影来合成未来场景。

Result: 在合成户外环境、Habitat室内场景和真实世界场景的综合基准测试中，EvoWorld在视觉保真度和空间场景一致性方面显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 演化3D记忆作为显式空间指导显著提升了视频生成过程的视觉真实感和几何一致性，代表了长时程空间一致世界建模的重要进展。

Abstract: Humans possess a remarkable ability to mentally explore and replay 3D
environments they have previously experienced. Inspired by this mental process,
we present EvoWorld: a world model that bridges panoramic video generation with
evolving 3D memory to enable spatially consistent long-horizon exploration.
Given a single panoramic image as input, EvoWorld first generates future video
frames by leveraging a video generator with fine-grained view control, then
evolves the scene's 3D reconstruction using a feedforward plug-and-play
transformer, and finally synthesizes futures by conditioning on geometric
reprojections from this evolving explicit 3D memory. Unlike prior
state-of-the-arts that synthesize videos only, our key insight lies in
exploiting this evolving 3D reconstruction as explicit spatial guidance for the
video generation process, projecting the reconstructed geometry onto target
viewpoints to provide rich spatial cues that significantly enhance both visual
realism and geometric consistency. To evaluate long-range exploration
capabilities, we introduce the first comprehensive benchmark spanning synthetic
outdoor environments, Habitat indoor scenes, and challenging real-world
scenarios, with particular emphasis on loop-closure detection and spatial
coherence over extended trajectories. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our evolving 3D memory substantially improves visual fidelity and maintains
spatial scene coherence compared to existing approaches, representing a
significant advance toward long-horizon spatially consistent world modeling.

Motivation: 解决视频编辑中多主体编辑的挑战，克服现有方法在多模态条件不足和掩码边界纠缠方面的问题，扩展视频编辑的适用性。

Method: 使用提示引导的多模态对齐模块和基于先验的掩码重定向模块，利用大模型生成多模态信息和掩码运动序列，然后输入预训练的掩码驱动视频生成模型合成编辑后的视频。

Conclusion: IMAGEdit是一个通用且高效的视频多主体编辑框架，兼容任何掩码驱动视频生成模型，显著提升整体性能，代码和数据集已公开。

Abstract: In this paper, we present IMAGEdit, a training-free framework for any number
of video subject editing that manipulates the appearances of multiple
designated subjects while preserving non-target regions, without finetuning or
retraining. We achieve this by providing robust multimodal conditioning and
precise mask sequences through a prompt-guided multimodal alignment module and
a prior-based mask retargeting module. We first leverage large models'
understanding and generation capabilities to produce multimodal information and
mask motion sequences for multiple subjects across various types. Then, the
obtained prior mask sequences are fed into a pretrained mask-driven video
generation model to synthesize the edited video. With strong generalization
capability, IMAGEdit remedies insufficient prompt-side multimodal conditioning
and overcomes mask boundary entanglement in videos with any number of subjects,
thereby significantly expanding the applicability of video editing. More
importantly, IMAGEdit is compatible with any mask-driven video generation
model, significantly improving overall performance. Extensive experiments on
our newly constructed multi-subject benchmark MSVBench verify that IMAGEdit
consistently surpasses state-of-the-art methods. Code, models, and datasets are
publicly available at https://github.com/XWH-A/IMAGEdit.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出基于Hamilton-Jacobi方程的最优传输新框架，通过特性方法推导闭式双向传输映射，无需数值积分，使用单一神经网络训练，保证收敛到最优映射且消除对抗训练阶段。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统最优传输方法计算复杂，需要数值积分和对抗训练。本文旨在开发更高效、理论保证的最优传输框架。

Method: 基于Hamilton-Jacobi方程的特性方法，推导闭式双向传输映射，采用纯最小化框架训练单一神经网络，损失函数来自HJ方程的特性方法。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验表明该方法具有高精度、可扩展性和效率，支持多种成本函数和类别条件传输。

Conclusion: 该方法为最优传输应用提供了理论严谨且通用的工具，具有可证明的最优性。

Abstract: We present a novel framework for solving optimal transport (OT) problems
based on the Hamilton--Jacobi (HJ) equation, whose viscosity solution uniquely
characterizes the OT map. By leveraging the method of characteristics, we
derive closed-form, bidirectional transport maps, thereby eliminating the need
for numerical integration. The proposed method adopts a pure minimization
framework: a single neural network is trained with a loss function derived from
the method of characteristics of the HJ equation. This design guarantees
convergence to the optimal map while eliminating adversarial training stages,
thereby substantially reducing computational complexity. Furthermore, the
framework naturally extends to a wide class of cost functions and supports
class-conditional transport. Extensive experiments on diverse datasets
demonstrate the accuracy, scalability, and efficiency of the proposed method,
establishing it as a principled and versatile tool for OT applications with
provable optimality.

Motivation: 当前RAG系统评估缺乏系统方法来确保测试集充分覆盖知识库内容，导致开发者存在盲点。

Method: 将文档块和测试问题嵌入统一向量空间，计算基本邻近度、内容加权覆盖率和多主题问题覆盖率等指标，并整合异常检测来过滤无关问题。

Result: 两个不同用例的实验证明，该框架能有效量化测试覆盖率，识别代表性不足的内容区域，并为生成新的高价值测试问题提供具体建议。

Conclusion: 为RAG开发者提供了构建更健壮测试套件的必要工具，从而提高系统可靠性，并可扩展到识别错位文档等应用。

Abstract: Reliably determining the performance of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
systems depends on comprehensive test questions. While a proliferation of
evaluation frameworks for LLM-powered applications exists, current practices
lack a systematic method to ensure these test sets adequately cover the
underlying knowledge base, leaving developers with significant blind spots. To
address this, we present a novel, applied methodology to quantify the semantic
coverage of RAG test questions against their underlying documents. Our approach
leverages existing technologies, including vector embeddings and clustering
algorithms, to create a practical framework for validating test
comprehensiveness. Our methodology embeds document chunks and test questions
into a unified vector space, enabling the calculation of multiple coverage
metrics: basic proximity, content-weighted coverage, and multi-topic question
coverage. Furthermore, we incorporate outlier detection to filter irrelevant
questions, allowing for the refinement of test sets. Experimental evidence from
two distinct use cases demonstrates that our framework effectively quantifies
test coverage, identifies specific content areas with inadequate
representation, and provides concrete recommendations for generating new,
high-value test questions. This work provides RAG developers with essential
tools to build more robust test suites, thereby improving system reliability
and extending to applications such as identifying misaligned documents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前最先进的机器学习原子间势能模型通过等变神经网络架构强制施加旋转平移对称性，这种硬编码的归纳偏置往往导致灵活性、计算效率和可扩展性降低。

Method: 提出TransIP训练范式，通过优化嵌入空间表示来引导通用非等变Transformer模型学习SO(3)等变性，无需显式架构约束。

Result: 在OMol25数据集上，TransIP在机器学习力场方面达到与最先进等变基线模型相当的性能，相比数据增强基线在不同数据集大小下性能提升40%到60%。

Conclusion: 学习得到的等变性可以成为等变或基于数据增强的MLIP模型的有力且高效替代方案。

Abstract: Accurate and scalable machine-learned inter-atomic potentials (MLIPs) are
essential for molecular simulations ranging from drug discovery to new material
design. Current state-of-the-art models enforce roto-translational symmetries
through equivariant neural network architectures, a hard-wired inductive bias
that can often lead to reduced flexibility, computational efficiency, and
scalability. In this work, we introduce TransIP: Transformer-based Inter-Atomic
Potentials, a novel training paradigm for interatomic potentials achieving
symmetry compliance without explicit architectural constraints. Our approach
guides a generic non-equivariant Transformer-based model to learn
SO(3)-equivariance by optimizing its representations in the embedding space.
Trained on the recent Open Molecules (OMol25) collection, a large and diverse
molecular dataset built specifically for MLIPs and covering different types of
molecules (including small organics, biomolecular fragments, and
electrolyte-like species), TransIP attains comparable performance in
machine-learning force fields versus state-of-the-art equivariant baselines.
Further, compared to a data augmentation baseline, TransIP achieves 40% to 60%
improvement in performance across varying OMol25 dataset sizes. More broadly,
our work shows that learned equivariance can be a powerful and efficient
alternative to equivariant or augmentation-based MLIP models.

TL;DR: 本文分析了RoPE位置插值与后训练量化结合时的精度下降问题，提出了Q-ROAR方法进行量化感知的插值稳定化，显著提升长上下文性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩展大语言模型的上下文窗口对长距离依赖任务至关重要，但RoPE位置插值与后训练量化结合会因多种耦合效应导致精度下降。

Method: 提出Q-ROAR方法：将RoPE维度分组到少量频带，对Key和Query权重进行轻量级的逐频带尺度搜索，使用插值压力和尾部膨胀比作为诊断指导。

Result: Q-ROAR将长上下文工作负载的困惑度降低超过14%，同时保持短上下文性能、推理吞吐量和现有LLM系统栈兼容性。

Conclusion: Q-ROAR是一种无需微调、无架构或内核更改、无额外部署开销的实用解决方案，有效解决了PI+PTQ的精度下降问题。

Abstract: Extending the context window support of large language models (LLMs) is
crucial for tasks with long-distance dependencies. RoPE-based interpolation and
extrapolation methods, such as linear scaling and frequency-aware schemes,
enable longer input length support without retraining, while post-training
quantization (PTQ) makes deployment practical. However, we show that combining
RoPE position interpolation (PI) with PTQ degrades accuracy due to coupled
effects including long-context aliasing, dynamic-range dilation, anisotropy
from axis-aligned quantizers vs. rotated RoPE pairs, and outlier shifting that
produces position-dependent logit noise. We provide, to the best of our
knowledge, the first systematic analysis of the PI+PTQ approach and introduce
two practical diagnostics: interpolation pressure (per-band sensitivity to
phase scaling) and tail-inflation ratios (outlier shift from short to long
contexts). Following the analysis results, we propose Q-ROAR (Quantization,
RoPE-interpolation, and Outlier Aware Rescaling), a weight-only,
interpolation-aware stabilization of PI for quantized LLMs. Q-ROAR groups RoPE
dimensions into a small number of frequency bands and performs a lightweight
search over per-band scales for Key and Query weights (with an optional
symmetric variant to preserve logit scale). The search is guided by our
diagnostics and uses a tiny long-context development dataset, requiring no
fine-tuning to the model, no architecture or kernel changes, and no additional
deployment overhead. Empirically, Q-ROAR reduces the model's perplexity on
long-context workloads by more than 14%, while preserving short-context
performance, inference throughput, and compatibility with existing LLM system
stacks.

Motivation: 现有健康基准测试要么过于通用，要么面向临床医生，缺乏专门针对糖尿病患者日常管理决策的评估框架。

Method: 收集15,000名糖尿病患者一个月的连续血糖监测数据和行为日志，生成360,600个个性化问题，评估8个LLM在7个任务类别上的表现。

Result: 不同模型在不同任务和指标上表现差异显著，没有单一模型在所有维度上都表现最优。

Conclusion: DexBench基准测试旨在提升糖尿病护理AI解决方案的可靠性、安全性和实用性。

Abstract: We present DexBench, the first benchmark designed to evaluate large language
model (LLM) performance across real-world decision-making tasks faced by
individuals managing diabetes in their daily lives. Unlike prior health
benchmarks that are either generic, clinician-facing or focused on clinical
tasks (e.g., diagnosis, triage), DexBench introduces a comprehensive evaluation
framework tailored to the unique challenges of prototyping patient-facing AI
solutions in diabetes, glucose management, metabolic health and related
domains. Our benchmark encompasses 7 distinct task categories, reflecting the
breadth of real-world questions individuals with diabetes ask, including basic
glucose interpretation, educational queries, behavioral associations, advanced
decision making and long term planning. Towards this end, we compile a rich
dataset comprising one month of time-series data encompassing glucose traces
and metrics from continuous glucose monitors (CGMs) and behavioral logs (e.g.,
eating and activity patterns) from 15,000 individuals across three different
diabetes populations (type 1, type 2, pre-diabetes/general health and
wellness). Using this data, we generate a total of 360,600 personalized,
contextual questions across the 7 tasks. We evaluate model performance on these
tasks across 5 metrics: accuracy, groundedness, safety, clarity and
actionability. Our analysis of 8 recent LLMs reveals substantial variability
across tasks and metrics; no single model consistently outperforms others
across all dimensions. By establishing this benchmark, we aim to advance the
reliability, safety, effectiveness and practical utility of AI solutions in
diabetes care.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了在p-adic度量空间中进行机器学习的新理论框架，证明了p-adic回归与欧几里得回归的关键差异，并通过自然语言处理应用验证了其实际价值。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的许多机器学习问题涉及层次化数据，但传统欧几里得度量无法捕捉层次关系的离散分支特性，需要更适合的数学框架。

Method: 建立p-adic度量空间的机器学习理论基础，证明n维平面最小化p-adic距离和时必须经过至少n+1个数据点的关键定理。

Result: 证明了p-adic回归与欧几里得回归的根本差异：p-adic回归必须经过更多实际数据点，这更符合层次数据的离散特性。

Conclusion: p-adic度量可能是处理机器学习中层次数据结构的基本工具，在层次数据中，选择实际观测点作为代表比插值更有意义。

Abstract: Many real-world machine learning problems involve inherently hierarchical
data, yet traditional approaches rely on Euclidean metrics that fail to capture
the discrete, branching nature of hierarchical relationships. We present a
theoretical foundation for machine learning in p-adic metric spaces, which
naturally respect hierarchical structure. Our main result proves that an
n-dimensional plane minimizing the p-adic sum of distances to points in a
dataset must pass through at least n + 1 of those points -- a striking contrast
to Euclidean regression that highlights how p-adic metrics better align with
the discrete nature of hierarchical data. As a corollary, a polynomial of
degree n constructed to minimise the p-adic sum of residuals will pass through
at least n + 1 points. As a further corollary, a polynomial of degree n
approximating a higher degree polynomial at a finite number of points will
yield a difference polynomial that has distinct rational roots. We demonstrate
the practical significance of this result through two applications in natural
language processing: analyzing hierarchical taxonomies and modeling grammatical
morphology. These results suggest that p-adic metrics may be fundamental to
properly handling hierarchical data structures in machine learning. In
hierarchical data, interpolation between points often makes less sense than
selecting actual observed points as representatives.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FedLLM-Align是一个联邦学习框架，利用预训练大语言模型作为通用特征提取器，将表格数据序列化为文本，生成语义对齐的嵌入表示，解决了联邦学习中表格数据异构性的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习在隐私敏感领域具有吸引力，但表格数据的异构性（不同客户端间的模式差异和特征空间不兼容）阻碍了直接聚合，需要一种无需手动模式对齐的解决方案。

Method: 将表格记录序列化为文本，使用预训练LLM（如DistilBERT、ALBERT、RoBERTa、ClinicalBERT）提取嵌入特征，在标准FedAvg协议下支持轻量级本地分类器。

Result: 在冠状动脉疾病预测任务中，使用分区Framingham数据集模拟模式差异，在所有客户端设置和LLM骨干网络下均优于现有基线方法，F1分数提升高达+0.25，通信成本降低65%。

Conclusion: FedLLM-Align是异构环境中联邦学习的稳健、隐私保护且通信高效的解决方案，即使在极端模式差异下也能优雅降级，而传统方法会完全失效。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training without sharing
raw data, making it attractive for privacy-sensitive domains such as
healthcare, finance, and IoT. A major obstacle, however, is the heterogeneity
of tabular data across clients, where divergent schemas and incompatible
feature spaces prevent straightforward aggregation. To address this challenge,
we propose FedLLM-Align, a federated framework that leverages pre-trained large
language models (LLMs) as universal feature extractors. Tabular records are
serialized into text, and embeddings from models such as DistilBERT, ALBERT,
RoBERTa, and ClinicalBERT provide semantically aligned representations that
support lightweight local classifiers under the standard FedAvg protocol. This
approach removes the need for manual schema harmonization while preserving
privacy, since raw data remain strictly local. We evaluate FedLLM-Align on
coronary heart disease prediction using partitioned Framingham datasets with
simulated schema divergence. Across all client settings and LLM backbones, our
method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving up to
+0.25 improvement in F1-score and a 65% reduction in communication cost. Stress
testing under extreme schema divergence further demonstrates graceful
degradation, unlike traditional methods that collapse entirely. These results
establish FedLLM-Align as a robust, privacy-preserving, and
communication-efficient solution for federated learning in heterogeneous
environments.

Motivation: AI决策系统在关键领域的广泛应用引发了算法公平性担忧。由于通常只能访问算法输出而无法了解其内部机制，研究社区提出了反事实公平性度量，但从可用数据评估这些度量仍具挑战性。

Method: 采用部分识别方法，从观测数据中推导反事实公平性度量的信息边界，并引入贝叶斯方法以高置信度约束未知的反事实公平性度量。

Result: 在COMPAS数据集上的实验显示，将种族改为非裔美国人时对COMPAS分数产生正向（伪）效应，而从年轻到年老的转变则产生负向（直接因果）效应。

Conclusion: 该方法为在反事实公平性度量不可识别的情况下提供了一种实用的评估框架，能够从观测数据中获得有意义的公平性边界估计。

Abstract: The wide adoption of AI decision-making systems in critical domains such as
criminal justice, loan approval, and hiring processes has heightened concerns
about algorithmic fairness. As we often only have access to the output of
algorithms without insights into their internal mechanisms, it was natural to
examine how decisions would alter when auxiliary sensitive attributes (such as
race) change. This led the research community to come up with counterfactual
fairness measures, but how to evaluate the measure from available data remains
a challenging task. In many practical applications, the target counterfactual
measure is not identifiable, i.e., it cannot be uniquely determined from the
combination of quantitative data and qualitative knowledge. This paper
addresses this challenge using partial identification, which derives
informative bounds over counterfactual fairness measures from observational
data. We introduce a Bayesian approach to bound unknown counterfactual fairness
measures with high confidence. We demonstrate our algorithm on the COMPAS
dataset, examining fairness in recidivism risk scores with respect to race,
age, and sex. Our results reveal a positive (spurious) effect on the COMPAS
score when changing race to African-American (from all others) and a negative
(direct causal) effect when transitioning from young to old age.

Abstract: Foundation models have reshaped AI by unifying fragmented architectures into
scalable backbones with multimodal reasoning and contextual adaptation. In
parallel, the long-standing notion of AI agents, defined by the
sensing-decision-action loop, is entering a new paradigm: with FMs as their
cognitive core, agents transcend rule-based behaviors to achieve autonomy,
generalization, and self-reflection. This dual shift is reinforced by
real-world demands such as autonomous driving, robotics, virtual assistants,
and GUI agents, as well as ecosystem advances in embedded hardware, edge
computing, mobile deployment platforms, and communication protocols that
together enable large-scale deployment. Yet this convergence collides with
reality: while applications demand long-term adaptability and real-time
interaction, mobile and edge deployments remain constrained by memory, energy,
bandwidth, and latency. This creates a fundamental tension between the growing
complexity of FMs and the limited resources of deployment environments. This
survey provides the first systematic characterization of adaptive,
resource-efficient agentic AI systems. We summarize enabling techniques into
elastic inference, test-time adaptation, dynamic multimodal integration, and
agentic AI applications, and identify open challenges in balancing
accuracy-latency-communication trade-offs and sustaining robustness under
distribution shifts. We further highlight future opportunities in
algorithm-system co-design, cognitive adaptation, and collaborative edge
deployment. By mapping FM structures, cognition, and hardware resources, this
work establishes a unified perspective toward scalable, adaptive, and
resource-efficient agentic AI. We believe this survey can help readers to
understand the connections between enabling technologies while promoting
further discussions on the fusion of agentic intelligence and intelligent
agents.

Conclusion: 近似单峰似然模型能够更好地适应真实世界序数数据的分布特性，在保持单峰结构优势的同时缓解了严格单峰模型的偏差问题。

Abstract: Ordinal regression (OR, also called ordinal classification) is classification
of ordinal data, in which the underlying target variable is categorical and
considered to have a natural ordinal relation for the underlying explanatory
variable. A key to successful OR models is to find a data structure `natural
ordinal relation' common to many ordinal data and reflect that structure into
the design of those models. A recent OR study found that many real-world
ordinal data show a tendency that the conditional probability distribution
(CPD) of the target variable given a value of the explanatory variable will
often be unimodal. Several previous studies thus developed unimodal likelihood
models, in which a predicted CPD is guaranteed to become unimodal. However, it
was also observed experimentally that many real-world ordinal data partly have
values of the explanatory variable where the underlying CPD will be
non-unimodal, and hence unimodal likelihood models may suffer from a bias for
such a CPD. Therefore, motivated to mitigate such a bias, we propose
approximately unimodal likelihood models, which can represent up to a unimodal
CPD and a CPD that is close to be unimodal. We also verify experimentally that
a proposed model can be effective for statistical modeling of ordinal data and
OR tasks.

Abstract: We introduce BigBang-Proton, a unified sequence-based architecture for
auto-regressive language modeling pretrained on cross-scale, cross-structure,
cross-discipline real-world scientific tasks to construct a scientific
multi-task learner. BigBang-Proton incorporates three fundamental innovations
compared to mainstream general-purpose LLMs: Theory-Experiment Learning
paradigm aligns large-scale numerical experimental data with theoretical text
corpora; Binary Patch Encoding replaces byte pair encoding(BPE) tokenization;
Monte Carlo Attention substitutes traditional transformer architectures.
Through next-word-prediction pretraining on cross-discipline scientific
datasets of real-world problems mixed with general textual corpus, followed by
fine-tuning and inference on downstream tasks, BigBang-Proton demonstrates
100\% accuracy in up to 50-digit arithmetic addition operations, performance on
par with leading specialized models in particle physics jet tagging, matching
MAE of specialized models in inter-atomic potential simulation, performance
comparable to traditional spatiotemporal models in water quality prediction,
and benchmark-exceeding performance in genome modeling. These results prove
that language-guided scientific computing can match or exceed the performance
of task-specific scientific models while maintaining multitask learning
capabilities. We further hypothesize to scale the pretraining to the universe
scale as a fundamental step toward developing material world foundational
model.

TL;DR: 提出了NeurTransformer方法，通过将transformer模型转换为脉冲神经网络(SNN)，解决传统transformer模型计算复杂度高的问题，同时保持模型性能并显著降低能耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统transformer模型在训练和部署时面临计算挑战，其时间和空间复杂度与输入序列长度呈二次关系。现有SNN训练方法效率低，而转换方法又存在延迟问题。

Method: 1) 用基于脉冲的自注意力(SSA)替换自注意力机制；2) 将训练好的transformer模型的feed-forward块转换为等效SNN；3) 使用SNN代理学习算法微调SSA块。

Result: 在GPT-2小模型上测试，转换后的模型余弦相似度损失5-12%，困惑度降低9.7%。SSA块相比ASA块能耗降低64.71%-85.28%。

Conclusion: NeurTransformer方法成功将transformer模型转换为SNN，在保持准确性的同时显著提高了能效，为大规模transformer模型的部署提供了可行的节能方案。

Abstract: Foundational models based on the transformer architecture are currently the
state-of-the-art in general language modeling, as well as in scientific areas
such as material science and climate. However, training and deploying these
models is computationally challenging as the time and space complexity has a
quadratic relation to the input sequence length. Several efforts exploring
efficient computational paradigms and model architectures to address these
limitations have been made. In this work, we explore spiking neural networks
(SNNs) to design transformer models. A challenge in training large-scale SNNs,
using existing surrogate learning methods is inefficient and time-consuming. On
the other hand, techniques to convert existing transformer-based models to
their SNN equivalent are not scalable, as achieving optimal performance comes
at the cost of a large number of spike time-steps, i.e. increased latency. To
address this, we propose NeurTransformer, a methodology for designing
transformer-based SNN for inference using a supervised fine-tuning approach
with existing conversion methods. The proposed methodology works by: (1)
replacing the self-attention mechanism with a spike-based self-attention (SSA),
(2) converting the feed-forward block of the trained transformer model to its
equivalent SNN, and (3) fine-tuning the SSA block using SNN-based surrogate
learning algorithms. We benchmark the proposed methodology and demonstrate its
accuracy and scalability using three variants of the GPT-2 model of increasing
model size. We observe that the converted GPT-2 small models demonstrate a
5-12% loss in cosine similarity and a 9.7% reduction in perplexity. Finally, we
demonstrate the energy efficiency of the SSA block compared to the ASA block
and show between 64.71% and 85.28% reductions in estimated energy consumption
when implementing the self-attention mechanism on a digital hardware.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类通过比较不同观察来学习概念，这种认知机制对机器概念学习同样重要，但目前概念学习领域缺乏理论支持。

Method: 开发了一个理论框架，通过多类别观察的概念可识别性分析，不假设特定概念类型、函数关系或参数生成模型。

Result: 证明在足够多样化的类别条件下，隐藏概念可以被识别，即使条件不全局满足，也能基于局部比较提供替代保证。

Conclusion: 该理论框架为概念学习提供了理论基础，验证了比较机制在机器概念学习中的重要性，并在合成和真实场景中得到验证。

Abstract: We are born with the ability to learn concepts by comparing diverse
observations. This helps us to understand the new world in a compositional
manner and facilitates extrapolation, as objects naturally consist of multiple
concepts. In this work, we argue that the cognitive mechanism of comparison,
fundamental to human learning, is also vital for machines to recover true
concepts underlying the data. This offers correctness guarantees for the field
of concept learning, which, despite its impressive empirical successes, still
lacks general theoretical support. Specifically, we aim to develop a
theoretical framework for the identifiability of concepts with multiple classes
of observations. We show that with sufficient diversity across classes, hidden
concepts can be identified without assuming specific concept types, functional
relations, or parametric generative models. Interestingly, even when conditions
are not globally satisfied, we can still provide alternative guarantees for as
many concepts as possible based on local comparisons, thereby extending the
applicability of our theory to more flexible scenarios. Moreover, the hidden
structure between classes and concepts can also be identified
nonparametrically. We validate our theoretical results in both synthetic and
real-world settings.

### [111] [Which Rewards Matter? Reward Selection for Reinforcement Learning under Limited Feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00144)

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出强化学习有限反馈下的奖励选择问题(RLLF)，研究如何选择最有影响力的样本来标注奖励，以在有限反馈下最大化策略性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实际应用中获取大量奖励标签往往不可行，特别是在依赖人类反馈时。当强化学习必须在有限反馈下进行时，需要解决哪些样本应该被标注奖励的关键问题。

Method: 研究两种选择策略：(i)基于无奖励信息的启发式方法，如状态访问和部分价值函数；(ii)使用辅助评估反馈预训练的策略。

Result: 发现关键奖励子集是那些能够引导智能体沿最优轨迹前进，并在偏离后支持恢复到接近最优行为的奖励。有效的选择方法仅需少量奖励标签就能获得接近最优的策略。

Conclusion: 奖励选择是在反馈受限环境中扩展强化学习的有力范式，能够显著减少所需的奖励标签数量。

Abstract: The ability of reinforcement learning algorithms to learn effective policies
is determined by the rewards available during training. However, for practical
problems, obtaining large quantities of reward labels is often infeasible due
to computational or financial constraints, particularly when relying on human
feedback. When reinforcement learning must proceed with limited feedback --
only a fraction of samples get rewards labeled -- a fundamental question
arises: which samples should be labeled to maximize policy performance? We
formalize this problem of reward selection for reinforcement learning from
limited feedback (RLLF), introducing a new problem formulation that facilitates
the study of strategies for selecting impactful rewards. Two types of selection
strategies are investigated: (i) heuristics that rely on reward-free
information such as state visitation and partial value functions, and (ii)
strategies pre-trained using auxiliary evaluative feedback. We find that
critical subsets of rewards are those that (1) guide the agent along optimal
trajectories, and (2) support recovery toward near-optimal behavior after
deviations. Effective selection methods yield near-optimal policies with
significantly fewer reward labels than full supervision, establishing reward
selection as a powerful paradigm for scaling reinforcement learning in
feedback-limited settings.

Motivation: 研究语言模型为何在看似简单的多位数乘法任务上表现不佳，通过分析成功学习乘法的模型来理解其内部机制。

Method: 逆向工程一个通过隐式思维链成功学习乘法的模型，使用logit归因和线性探针分析长程依赖，研究注意力机制如何构建有向无环图来缓存和检索部分乘积。

Result: 发现模型通过注意力形成Minkowski和来表示部分乘积，使用傅里叶基表示数字，这些是标准微调模型缺乏的高效表示方式。标准微调模型因缺乏长程依赖而收敛到局部最优。

Conclusion: 通过引入预测"运行和"的辅助损失作为归纳偏置，可以使模型成功学习多位数乘法，揭示了Transformer学习长程依赖的陷阱及正确归纳偏置的重要性。

Abstract: Language models are increasingly capable, yet still fail at a seemingly
simple task of multi-digit multiplication. In this work, we study why, by
reverse-engineering a model that successfully learns multiplication via
\emph{implicit chain-of-thought}, and report three findings: (1) Evidence of
long-range structure: Logit attributions and linear probes indicate that the
model encodes the necessary long-range dependencies for multi-digit
multiplication. (2) Mechanism: the model encodes long-range dependencies using
attention to construct a directed acyclic graph to ``cache'' and ``retrieve''
pairwise partial products. (3) Geometry: the model implements partial products
in attention heads by forming Minkowski sums between pairs of digits, and
digits are represented using a Fourier basis, both of which are intuitive and
efficient representations that the standard fine-tuning model lacks. With these
insights, we revisit the learning dynamics of standard fine-tuning and find
that the model converges to a local optimum that lacks the required long-range
dependencies. We further validate this understanding by introducing an
auxiliary loss that predicts the ``running sum'' via a linear regression probe,
which provides an inductive bias that enables the model to successfully learn
multi-digit multiplication. In summary, by reverse-engineering the mechanisms
of an implicit chain-of-thought model we uncover a pitfall for learning
long-range dependencies in Transformers and provide an example of how the
correct inductive bias can address this issue.

TL;DR: PrunedLoRA：一种通过结构化剪枝从过参数化初始化中获得高代表性低秩适配器的新框架，动态剪枝不重要组件并防止其重新激活，实现灵活的自适应秩分配。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LoRA在参数高效微调中广泛应用，但其表示能力通常落后于完全微调。关键问题是如何从过参数化空间中获得表达性强的低秩适配器。

Method: 利用结构化剪枝，在微调过程中动态剪枝不重要组件并防止重新激活，通过最小化整体损失的剪枝误差，在基于梯度的剪枝策略中提供细粒度的剪枝和恢复更新。

Result: 在数学推理、代码生成和自然语言理解等监督微调任务中，PrunedLoRA持续优于LoRA及其变体，并在不同稀疏度水平上优于现有结构化剪枝方法。

Conclusion: PrunedLoRA通过结构化剪枝和动态秩分配，显著提升了低秩适配器的表示能力，为参数高效微调提供了更有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) has become a widely used paradigm for
parameter-efficient fine-tuning of large language models, yet its
representational capacity often lags behind full fine-tuning. Within the
context of LoRA, a key open question is how to obtain expressive low-rank
adapters from over-parameterized spaces. We propose \textit{PrunedLoRA}, a new
framework that leverages structured pruning to obtain highly representative
low-rank adapters from an over-parameterized initialization. Unlike prior
approaches that impose a fixed low-rank budget, PrunedLoRA dynamically prunes
less important components during fine-tuning and prevents their reactivation,
enabling flexible and adaptive rank allocation. For structured pruning, by
minimizing the pruning error for overall loss, we provide fine-grained pruning
and recovery updates in a gradient-based pruning strategy with grounded
interpretation. We provide the first theoretical analysis of the robustness of
structured pruning and provably show that under the impact of weight
perturbation, gradient-based pruning is more robust than activation-based
pruning with respect to overall loss. Empirically, PrunedLoRA consistently
outperforms LoRA and its variants across supervised fine-tuning tasks in
mathematical reasoning, code generation, and natural language understanding,
and it also demonstrates advantages over existing structured pruning methods
across diverse sparsity levels.

TL;DR: GRPO-λ是对GRPO的扩展，通过λ-return和资格迹改进LLM在复杂推理任务中的信用分配，显著提升训练效率和最终性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GRPO方法在LLM推理后训练中缺乏细粒度信用分配能力，限制了其在复杂推理任务中的效果。

Method: 使用基于token级对数概率的资格迹重新表述来近似λ-return学习，并提出无评论者的时序差分误差近似方法。

Result: 在1.5B到7B参数模型上，相比GRPO训练性能提升30-40%，在多个数学推理数据集上平均性能提升超过3分。

Conclusion: GRPO-λ通过改进信用分配机制，显著提升了RL后训练在复杂推理任务中的效果。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed for tasks requiring
complex reasoning, prompting significant interest in improving their reasoning
abilities through post-training. Especially RL based methods using verifiable
reward, like the state-of-the-art GRPO, have shown to tremendously improve
reasoning behaviors when applied as post-training methods. However, the lack of
an explicit reward or critic model limits GRPO's ability to assign fine-grained
credit across token sequences. In this work, we present GRPO-$\lambda$, a novel
extension to GRPO that enhances credit assignment in RL finetuning of LLMs for
complex reasoning tasks. We approximate learning from $\lambda$-return with a
reformulation of eligibility traces using token-level log-probabilities applied
after each sequence generation, and a novel critic-free approximation of the
temporal-difference error. We introduce a few variations for the weighting of
the $\lambda$-return, and their applications to the eligibility-trace, where
all the variations provide significant gains over GRPO. We compare
GRPO-$\lambda$ against GRPO by training models from 1.5B to 7B parameters on
$4$ different math reasoning datasets. The training plots demonstrate 30-40%
improved performance during RL training on both LLaMA-3.1 and Qwen-2.5
architectures. Finally, we show that with GRPO-$\lambda$, the resulting average
performance on AIME24, Math500, OlympiadMath, MinervaMath, and AMC improves
over GRPO by over $3$ points and a $4.5$ points improvement on the 7B model.

Result: 利用该框架生成了初始排行榜，并提供了详细的指标比较。

Conclusion: RouterArena将成为首个公开的LLM路由器比较平台，帮助解决选择合适路由器的挑战。

Abstract: Today's LLM ecosystem comprises a wide spectrum of models that differ in
size, capability, and cost. No single model is optimal for all scenarios;
hence, LLM routers have become essential for selecting the most appropriate
model under varying circumstances. However, the rapid emergence of various
routers makes choosing the right one increasingly challenging. To address this
problem, we need a comprehensive router comparison and a standardized
leaderboard, similar to those available for models. In this work, we introduce
RouterArena, the first open platform enabling comprehensive comparison of LLM
routers. RouterArena has (1) a principally constructed dataset with broad
knowledge domain coverage, (2) distinguishable difficulty levels for each
domain, (3) an extensive list of evaluation metrics, and (4) an automated
framework for leaderboard updates. Leveraging our framework, we have produced
the initial leaderboard with detailed metrics comparison as shown in Figure 1.
We will make our platform open to the public soon.

TL;DR: LoRAFusion是一个高效的LoRA微调系统，通过图分割融合内存绑定操作和自适应批处理算法，解决了现有LoRA系统的内存访问冗余和多适配器并发微调效率低的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LoRA微调系统存在两个关键低效问题：1）由于对大激活张量的冗余内存访问导致大量运行时开销；2）无法在相同GPU上并发微调多个共享基础模型的独立LoRA适配器，错失了减少流水线气泡、改善通信重叠和GPU负载平衡等性能增益机会。

Method: LoRAFusion在核级别提出图分割方法融合内存绑定操作，消除不必要的内存访问；在调度级别引入自适应批处理算法，将LoRA适配器分组以错开批次执行，并在组内解决装箱问题生成平衡的、依赖感知的微批次。

Result: LoRAFusion相比Megatron-LM实现了最高1.96倍（平均1.47倍）的端到端加速，相比最先进的多LoRA微调系统mLoRA实现了最高1.46倍（平均1.29倍）的改进。融合核实现了最高1.39倍（平均1.27倍）的核性能提升，可作为现有LoRA系统的即插即用替代方案。

Conclusion: LoRAFusion通过核级优化和调度级优化，显著提升了LoRA微调的效率和性能，为大规模语言模型的高效微调提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has become the leading Parameter-Efficient
Fine-Tuning (PEFT) method for Large Language Models (LLMs), as it significantly
reduces GPU memory usage while maintaining competitive fine-tuned model quality
on downstream tasks. Despite these benefits, we identify two key inefficiencies
in existing LoRA fine-tuning systems. First, they incur substantial runtime
overhead due to redundant memory accesses on large activation tensors. Second,
they miss the opportunity to concurrently fine-tune multiple independent LoRA
adapters that share the same base model on the same set of GPUs. This leads to
missed performance gains such as reduced pipeline bubbles, better communication
overlap, and improved GPU load balance.
  To address these issues, we introduce LoRAFusion, an efficient LoRA
fine-tuning system for LLMs. At the kernel level, we propose a graph-splitting
method that fuses memory-bound operations. This design eliminates unnecessary
memory accesses and preserves the performance of compute-bound GEMMs without
incurring the cost of recomputation or synchronization. At the scheduling
level, LoRAFusion introduces an adaptive batching algorithm for multi-job
fine-tuning. It first splits LoRA adapters into groups to intentionally stagger
batch execution across jobs, and then solves a bin-packing problem within each
group to generate balanced, dependency-aware microbatches. LoRAFusion achieves
up to $1.96\times$ ($1.47\times$ on average) end-to-end speedup compared to
Megatron-LM, and up to $1.46\times$ ($1.29\times$ on average) improvement over
mLoRA, the state-of-the-art multi-LoRA fine-tuning system. Our fused kernel
achieves up to $1.39\times$ ($1.27\times$ on average) kernel performance
improvement and can directly serve as a plug-and-play replacement in existing
LoRA systems. We open-source LoRAFusion at
https://github.com/CentML/lorafusion.

Result: 在CartPole-v1、LunarLander-v2和两车交叉路口场景中，Directed-MAML在计算效率和收敛速度上优于MAML基线方法。

Conclusion: 任务导向近似可有效集成到其他元学习算法中，如FOMAML和Meta-SGD，提升计算效率和收敛速度。

Abstract: Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) is a versatile meta-learning framework
applicable to both supervised learning and reinforcement learning (RL).
However, applying MAML to meta-reinforcement learning (meta-RL) presents
notable challenges. First, MAML relies on second-order gradient computations,
leading to significant computational and memory overhead. Second, the nested
structure of optimization increases the problem's complexity, making
convergence to a global optimum more challenging. To overcome these
limitations, we propose Directed-MAML, a novel task-directed meta-RL algorithm.
Before the second-order gradient step, Directed-MAML applies an additional
first-order task-directed approximation to estimate the effect of second-order
gradients, thereby accelerating convergence to the optimum and reducing
computational cost. Experimental results demonstrate that Directed-MAML
surpasses MAML-based baselines in computational efficiency and convergence
speed in the scenarios of CartPole-v1, LunarLander-v2 and two-vehicle
intersection crossing. Furthermore, we show that task-directed approximation
can be effectively integrated into other meta-learning algorithms, such as
First-Order Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (FOMAML) and Meta Stochastic Gradient
Descent(Meta-SGD), yielding improved computational efficiency and convergence
speed.

Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Current approaches for scaling inference-time compute in transformers rely on
training them to emit explicit chain-of-thought tokens before producing an
answer. While these methods are powerful, they are limited because they cannot
be applied during pretraining and are limited to only serially-generated,
natural-language verbalization to scale inference-time compute. In this work,
we propose Thoughtbubbles, a transformer variant that natively performs
parallel adaptive computation in latent space by learning to fork or delete
residual streams. Thus, tokens that require a large amount of computation can
form a "bubble" of cloned residuals in the middle of the network for additional
thinking. Crucially, this behavior is learned during pretraining with only
language modeling loss. Thoughtbubbles outperforms both standard decoder LMs as
well as non-adaptive parallel computation approaches on OpenWebText and peS2o
perplexity and in zero-shot evaluations such as HellaSwag and LAMBADA after
pretraining across 150M to 772M parameter scales. The implicit nature of our
method enables adaptive computation to be learned starting at pretraining time,
paving the way to unify train and test-time behavior for reasoning models.

Motivation: 研究KV缓存压缩在实际多指令场景中的影响，特别是发现某些指令在压缩后会严重退化甚至被完全忽略的问题，以系统提示泄露为例揭示压缩的潜在风险。

Method: 通过实证研究分析不同压缩方法、指令顺序和KV驱逐偏差对系统提示泄露和指令遵循的影响，并提出改进的KV缓存驱逐策略。

Result: 发现KV压缩会导致某些指令性能急剧下降，系统提示容易泄露，压缩方法、指令顺序和驱逐偏差都是重要影响因素。提出的改进策略能减轻这些影响。

Conclusion: KV缓存压缩在实际部署中需要谨慎，某些指令会因压缩而失效，通过优化驱逐策略可以改善多指令任务的整体性能。

Abstract: KV cache compression promises increased throughput and efficiency with
negligible loss in performance. While the gains in throughput are indisputable
and recent literature has indeed shown minimal degradation on particular
benchmarks, in general the consequences of compression in realistic scenarios
such as multi-instruction prompting have been insufficiently studied. In this
paper, we identify several pitfalls practitioners should be aware of when
deploying KV cache compressed LLMs. Importantly, we show that certain
instructions degrade much more rapidly with compression, effectively causing
them to be completely ignored by the LLM. As a practical example of that, we
highlight system prompt leakage as a case study, empirically showing the impact
of compression on leakage and general instruction following. We show several
factors that play a role in prompt leakage: compression method, instruction
order, and KV eviction bias. We then propose simple changes to KV cache
eviction policies that can reduce the impact of these factors and improve the
overall performance in multi-instruction tasks.

Conclusion: DIANO能够在促进维度和几何约简的潜空间中求解PDE，同时保持潜空间的可解释性。

Abstract: Scientific machine learning has enabled the extraction of physical insights
from high-dimensional spatiotemporal flow data using linear and nonlinear
dimensionality reduction techniques. Despite these advances, achieving
interpretability within the latent space remains a challenge. To address this,
we propose the DIfferentiable Autoencoding Neural Operator (DIANO), a
deterministic autoencoding neural operator framework that constructs physically
interpretable latent spaces for both dimensional and geometric reduction, with
the provision to enforce differential governing equations directly within the
latent space. Built upon neural operators, DIANO compresses high-dimensional
input functions into a low-dimensional latent space via spatial coarsening
through an encoding neural operator and subsequently reconstructs the original
inputs using a decoding neural operator through spatial refinement. We assess
DIANO's latent space interpretability and performance in dimensionality
reduction against baseline models, including the Convolutional Neural Operator
and standard autoencoders. Furthermore, a fully differentiable partial
differential equation (PDE) solver is developed and integrated within the
latent space, enabling the temporal advancement of both high- and low-fidelity
PDEs, thereby embedding physical priors into the latent dynamics. We further
investigate various PDE formulations, including the 2D unsteady
advection-diffusion and the 3D Pressure-Poisson equation, to examine their
influence on shaping the latent flow representations. Benchmark problems
considered include flow past a 2D cylinder, flow through a 2D symmetric
stenosed artery, and a 3D patient-specific coronary artery. These case studies
demonstrate DIANO's capability to solve PDEs within a latent space that
facilitates both dimensional and geometrical reduction while allowing latent
interpretability.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种在自动微分框架中高效计算梯度统计信息的方法，通过AD图手术实现，几乎不增加计算和内存开销。研究还发现signSGD中符号操作的位置对性能至关重要，以及Adam预处理器应更关注梯度分布的均值而非方差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习训练算法通常将小批量样本视为单一对象，仅计算梯度平均值。作者认为计算更多梯度统计信息在自动微分框架中并非资源密集型，这能为算法设计提供新的分析和可能性。

Method: 通过自动微分图手术实现梯度统计计算，在某些情况下几乎不增加计算和内存开销。在特定模型类别中，使用JAX的向量化变换进行原型实现。研究了signSGD中符号操作的最佳位置和Adam预处理器的变体。

Result: 发现signSGD中符号操作的位置对成功至关重要，可通过简单的信噪比参数预测。Adam预处理器在优化中最好由梯度分布的均值主导，而非传统认为的方差主导。

Conclusion: 逐样本梯度信息为算法设计开启了新的分析和可能性，证明了在自动微分框架中高效计算梯度统计信息的可行性。

Abstract: Training algorithms in deep learning usually treat a mini-batch of samples as
a single object; they average gradients over the mini-batch, and then process
the average in various ways. Computing other statistics beyond the average may
have been seen as prohibitively resource intensive in automatic differentiation
(AD) frameworks. We show that this is not the case. Generally, gradient
statistics can be implemented through a surgery of the AD graph, which, in some
cases, incur almost no computational and memory overheads compared to the
mini-batch gradient computation. Additionally, we show that in certain classes
of models, including transformers, JAX's vectorization transformation offers a
viable implementation for prototyping and experimentation. We then revise our
understanding of two nonlinear operations in optimization through the lens of
per-example gradient transformations. We first study signSGD and show that the
optimal placement of the sign operation in the gradient processing chain is
crucial to success and can be predicted with a simple signal-to-noise ratio
argument. Next we study per-example variations of the Adam preconditioner, and
show that optimization is best served when the preconditioner is dominated by
the mean rather than the variance of the gradient distribution - in contrast to
conventional wisdom. Overall we demonstrate that per-example gradient
information enables new analyses and possibilities for algorithm design.

### [122] [Debunk the Myth of SFT Generalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00237)
*Xiaofeng Lin,Hejian Sang,Zhipeng Wang,Xuezhou Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文挑战了监督微调(SFT)缺乏泛化能力而强化学习(RL)泛化更好的观点，通过系统实验证明SFT在适当的数据增强(如提示多样性和思维链监督)下可以达到与RL相当的泛化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 重新审视SFT缺乏泛化能力的普遍观点，探索通过数据增强方法提升SFT泛化性能的可能性。

Method: 在两个决策基准(Sokoban和General Points)上系统评估，引入提示多样性训练和思维链监督作为数据增强方法。

Result: 提示多样性训练解决了固定提示模板的伪影问题，思维链监督显著提升到更难任务的迁移能力，两者结合在指令变体和难度变体设置中都达到最佳泛化性能，匹配或超越RL基线。

Conclusion: SFT并非天生劣于RL，通过适当的数据增强方法，简单的SFT可以达到与RL相当的泛化能力，支持数据中心的视角。

Abstract: A prevailing view holds that supervised fine-tuning (SFT) memorizes training
data and fails to generalize, whereas reinforcement learning (RL) attains
broader robustness. We revisit this claim through a systematic evaluation on
two decision-making benchmarks, Sokoban and General Points, and arrive at a
different conclusion. We show that much of SFT's perceived failure stems from
frozen-prompt artifacts: when trained on fixed instruction templates, SFT
models cling to training semantics rather than adapting to new ones.
Introducing prompt diversity during training breaks this shortcut and yields
strong generalization to unseen instruction variants without harming
in-distribution performance. Beyond instruction shifts, we ask whether SFT can
generalize to strictly harder tasks. Here, chain-of-thought (CoT) supervision
provides an algorithmic scaffold that markedly improves transfer to more
difficult regimes, such as larger Sokoban grids with additional boxes and
arithmetic with out-of-distribution values or five-card compositions that
increase combinatorial complexity. Finally, combining prompt diversity with CoT
achieves the best of both worlds: robust generalization across both
instruction-variant and difficulty-variant settings, matching or surpassing RL
baselines on our benchmarks while retaining SFT's simplicity and stability.
These findings challenge the narrative that SFT is inherently inferior to RL
and support a data-centric perspective: with appropriately curated
demonstrations, vanilla SFT can generalize as strongly as RL. Code reproducing

TL;DR: 该研究开发了基于奖励的策略来自动优化变分自编码器(VAE)工作流程，使用高斯混合模型和贝叶斯高斯混合模型构建奖励函数，以评估潜在空间表示的质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 显微镜技术产生大量复杂图像数据，需要发现更简单、可解释的表示形式来揭示底层物理结构。VAE虽然强大，但其性能依赖于多个设计选择，通常需要通过试错和经验分析来优化。

Method: 使用压电力显微镜数据作为模型系统，研究基于奖励的策略来评估潜在空间表示。采用高斯混合模型(GMM)和贝叶斯高斯混合模型(BGMM)来近似潜在空间，构建奖励函数。

Result: 分析表明，使用GMM和BGMM近似潜在空间为构建奖励函数提供了坚实基础，能够估计模型效率并指导寻找最优简约表示。

Conclusion: 基于GMM和BGMM的奖励函数策略能够实现VAE工作流程的自动化和无偏优化，为寻找最优简约表示提供有效指导。

Abstract: Microscopy techniques generate vast amounts of complex image data that in
principle can be used to discover simpler, interpretable, and parsimonious
forms to reveal the underlying physical structures, such as elementary building
blocks in molecular systems or order parameters and phases in crystalline
materials. Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) provide a powerful means of
constructing such low-dimensional representations, but their performance
heavily depends on multiple non-myopic design choices, which are often
optimized through trial-and-error and empirical analysis. To enable automated
and unbiased optimization of VAE workflows, we investigated reward-based
strategies for evaluating latent space representations. Using Piezoresponse
Force Microscopy data as a model system, we examined multiple policies and
reward functions that can serve as a foundation for automated optimization. Our
analysis shows that approximating the latent space with Gaussian Mixture Models
(GMM) and Bayesian Gaussian Mixture Models (BGMM) provides a strong basis for
constructing reward functions capable of estimating model efficiency and
guiding the search for optimal parsimonious representations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受编码计算范式的启发，旨在开发一种高效的正则化机制，鼓励更平滑的表征和更可泛化的解决方案，同时增强模型对抗扰动的鲁棒性。

Method: 设计编码平滑模块，基于编码计算原理处理数据的线性组合，可集成到监督和无监督训练流程中，也可在推理时使用以随机化模型。

Result: 在监督和无监督任务上的广泛实验表明，编码平滑能持续改善泛化性能，并在基于梯度的对抗攻击下达到最先进的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 编码平滑模块是一种计算开销小但效果显著的正则化方法，能同时提升模型的泛化能力和对抗鲁棒性。

Abstract: We introduce the coded-smoothing module, which can be seamlessly integrated
into standard training pipelines, both supervised and unsupervised, to
regularize learning and improve generalization with minimal computational
overhead. In addition, it can be incorporated into the inference pipeline to
randomize the model and enhance robustness against adversarial perturbations.
The design of coded-smoothing is inspired by general coded computing, a
paradigm originally developed to mitigate straggler and adversarial failures in
distributed computing by processing linear combinations of the data rather than
the raw inputs. Building on this principle, we adapt coded computing to machine
learning by designing an efficient and effective regularization mechanism that
encourages smoother representations and more generalizable solutions. Extensive
experiments on both supervised and unsupervised tasks demonstrate that
coded-smoothing consistently improves generalization and achieves
state-of-the-art robustness against gradient-based adversarial attacks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文研究了序列模型在包含状态跟踪和关联回忆的复合问题上的长度泛化能力，发现混合模型中的Transformer组件倾向于利用捷径解决方案，提出延迟注意力层训练的策略来改善长度泛化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动机在于结合循环网络和Transformer的互补优势——循环网络擅长状态跟踪但难以处理回忆任务，而Transformer擅长回忆但无法将状态跟踪能力扩展到长序列。

Method: 构建结合循环和注意力组件的混合模型，并提出延迟注意力层训练的策略来防止Transformer组件利用捷径解决方案。

Result: 实验显示该方法使混合模型在比训练序列长三倍的混合序列上达到接近完美的准确率（>90%）。

Conclusion: 延迟注意力层训练是解决混合模型中Transformer组件捷径依赖问题的简单有效策略，显著提升了长度泛化性能。

Abstract: We study length generalization in sequence models on a composite problem
involving both state tracking and associative recall. Prior work finds that
recurrent networks handle state tracking well but struggle with recall, whereas
Transformers excel at recall yet fail to extend state-tracking capabilities to
longer sequences. Motivated by the complementary strengths of these
architectures, we construct hybrid models integrating recurrent and
attention-based components, and train them on the combined task to evaluate
whether both capabilities can be preserved. Our results reveal that, in such
hybrids, the Transformer component tends to exploit shortcut solutions, leading
to poor length generalization. We identify this shortcut reliance as a key
obstacle and propose a simple yet effective training strategy -- delaying the
training of the attention layers -- that mitigates this effect and
significantly improves length generalization performance. Our experiments show
that this approach enables hybrid models to achieve near-perfect accuracy
($>90\%$) on hybrid sequences three times longer than those used during
training.

TL;DR: 提出基于能量的变分潜在先验(EVaLP)方法，通过将先验建模为能量模型并使用变分方法处理归一化常数，解决了VAE中的"先验空洞"问题，提高了生成质量和采样效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决VAE中存在的"先验空洞"问题，即先验分布高概率区域在后验分布中概率较低，导致生成样本质量差。需要在保持先验灵活性的同时实现快速采样。

Method: 将先验建模为能量模型(EBM)，使用变分方法处理归一化常数，避免昂贵的MCMC采样。通过交替优化训练先验，采样网络在生成时简化为隐式变分先验。

Result: 与多个SOTA基线相比，EVaLP方法在图像生成质量、减少先验空洞和采样效率方面均有提升。

Conclusion: 基于能量的变分潜在先验方法有效解决了VAE的生成质量问题，在保持灵活性的同时实现了高效采样。

Abstract: Variational Auto-Encoders (VAEs) are known to generate blurry and
inconsistent samples. One reason for this is the "prior hole" problem. A prior
hole refers to regions that have high probability under the VAE's prior but low
probability under the VAE's posterior. This means that during data generation,
high probability samples from the prior could have low probability under the
posterior, resulting in poor quality data. Ideally, a prior needs to be
flexible enough to match the posterior while retaining the ability to generate
samples fast. Generative models continue to address this tradeoff. This paper
proposes to model the prior as an energy-based model (EBM). While EBMs are
known to offer the flexibility to match posteriors (and also improving the
ELBO), they are traditionally slow in sample generation due to their dependency
on MCMC methods. Our key idea is to bring a variational approach to tackle the
normalization constant in EBMs, thus bypassing the expensive MCMC approaches.
The variational form can be approximated with a sampler network, and we show
that such an approach to training priors can be formulated as an alternating
optimization problem. Moreover, the same sampler reduces to an implicit
variational prior during generation, providing efficient and fast sampling. We
compare our Energy-based Variational Latent Prior (EVaLP) method to multiple
SOTA baselines and show improvements in image generation quality, reduced prior
holes, and better sampling efficiency.

TL;DR: SLogic是一个新颖的知识图谱补全框架，通过为逻辑规则分配查询相关的动态置信度分数，利用查询头实体的局部子图信息来评估规则重要性，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有逻辑规则方法通常将规则视为通用的，为每个规则分配固定的置信度分数，忽略了查询特定的上下文。然而，规则的重要性会因查询而异，这是一个重要限制。

Method: 提出SLogic框架，其核心是一个评分函数，利用查询头实体为中心的子图信息，动态评估每个规则的重要性，为逻辑规则分配查询相关的分数。

Result: 在基准数据集上的广泛实验表明，通过利用局部子图上下文，SLogic在知识图谱补全任务上持续优于最先进的基线方法，包括基于嵌入和基于规则的方法。

Conclusion: SLogic通过引入查询相关的规则评分机制，有效解决了传统逻辑规则方法中规则重要性固定的局限性，显著提升了知识图谱补全的性能。

Abstract: Logical rule-based methods offer an interpretable approach to knowledge graph
completion by capturing compositional relationships in the form of
human-readable inference rules. However, current approaches typically treat
logical rules as universal, assigning each rule a fixed confidence score that
ignores query-specific context. This is a significant limitation, as a rule's
importance can vary depending on the query. To address this, we introduce
SLogic (Subgraph-Informed Logical Rule learning), a novel framework that
assigns query-dependent scores to logical rules. The core of SLogic is a
scoring function that utilizes the subgraph centered on a query's head entity,
allowing the significance of each rule to be assessed dynamically. Extensive
experiments on benchmark datasets show that by leveraging local subgraph
context, SLogic consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, including
both embedding-based and rule-based methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散大语言模型虽然具有双向注意力机制的优势，但与KV缓存不兼容，导致推理效率不如自回归模型。现有并行解码算法虽然能加速推理，但会带来性能下降。

Method: 提出Freedave算法，采用并行解码的候选生成和验证流水线，保证生成与静态采样相同的序列，无需额外模型前向调用。

Result: 在数学推理任务上，Freedave将DLLMs的吞吐量提升至2.8倍，且无性能损失。

Conclusion: Freedave成功解决了DLLMs推理效率低的问题，实现了无损的并行解码加速。

Abstract: Diffusion Large Language Models (DLLMs) have emerged as a new paradigm of
language modeling beyond autoregressive next-token prediction. Thanks to their
bidirectional attention mechanism, DLLMs are more capable of capturing the
connection of context, and thus show unique advantages in challenges like the
famous "reversal curse" or learning under data-constrained scenarios. However,
this bidirectional nature also brings an obstacle that DLLMs are not inherently
compatible with KV Cache, and consequently, the inference efficiency is not
competitive compared with autoregressive models. Taking advantage of their
inherent capability of multi-token prediction, existing parallel decoding
algorithms can speed up the DLLM inference, but at the cost of non-negligible
performance degradation. To overcome this challenge, we introduce Free
Draft-and-Verification (Freedave), a novel fast sampling algorithm tailored for
DLLMs that achieves lossless parallel decoding. Specifically, we propose a
pipeline of parallel-decoded candidate generation and verification, which is
guaranteed to reproduce the same sequence generated by static sampling, without
introducing extra model forward calls. By applying Freedave, the throughput of
DLLMs can be boosted up to $2.8\times$ without performance degradation on math
reasoning tasks.

Abstract: Detecting hallucinations in Large Language Model-generated text is crucial
for their safe deployment. While probing classifiers show promise, they operate
on isolated layer-token pairs and are LLM-specific, limiting their
effectiveness and hindering cross-LLM applications. In this paper, we introduce
a novel approach to address these shortcomings. We build on the natural
sequential structure of activation data in both axes (layers $\times$ tokens)
and advocate treating full activation tensors akin to images. We design
ACT-ViT, a Vision Transformer-inspired model that can be effectively and
efficiently applied to activation tensors and supports training on data from
multiple LLMs simultaneously. Through comprehensive experiments encompassing
diverse LLMs and datasets, we demonstrate that ACT-ViT consistently outperforms
traditional probing techniques while remaining extremely efficient for
deployment. In particular, we show that our architecture benefits substantially
from multi-LLM training, achieves strong zero-shot performance on unseen
datasets, and can be transferred effectively to new LLMs through fine-tuning.

Motivation: 深度学习模型在平稳数据上表现优异，但在非平稳环境中会遭遇塑性损失问题，即模型未来学习能力的退化。本文旨在从基本原理层面理解这一现象。

Method: 基于动力系统理论，通过识别参数空间中的稳定流形来正式定义塑性损失，分析激活饱和导致的冻结单元和表示冗余导致的克隆单元流形这两种主要机制。

Result: 研究发现，在静态设置中促进泛化的特性（如低秩表示和简单性偏置）在持续学习场景中直接导致塑性损失，理论分析通过数值模拟得到验证。

Conclusion: 本文揭示了泛化与持续学习之间的根本张力，并探讨了架构选择或针对性扰动作为潜在的缓解策略。

Abstract: Deep learning models excel in stationary data but struggle in non-stationary
environments due to a phenomenon known as loss of plasticity (LoP), the
degradation of their ability to learn in the future. This work presents a
first-principles investigation of LoP in gradient-based learning. Grounded in
dynamical systems theory, we formally define LoP by identifying stable
manifolds in the parameter space that trap gradient trajectories. Our analysis
reveals two primary mechanisms that create these traps: frozen units from
activation saturation and cloned-unit manifolds from representational
redundancy. Our framework uncovers a fundamental tension: properties that
promote generalization in static settings, such as low-rank representations and
simplicity biases, directly contribute to LoP in continual learning scenarios.
We validate our theoretical analysis with numerical simulations and explore
architectural choices or targeted perturbations as potential mitigation
strategies.

Abstract: The Lipschitz bandit problem extends stochastic bandits to a continuous
action set defined over a metric space, where the expected reward function
satisfies a Lipschitz condition. In this work, we introduce a new problem of
Lipschitz bandit in the presence of stochastic delayed feedback, where the
rewards are not observed immediately but after a random delay. We consider both
bounded and unbounded stochastic delays, and design algorithms that attain
sublinear regret guarantees in each setting. For bounded delays, we propose a
delay-aware zooming algorithm that retains the optimal performance of the
delay-free setting up to an additional term that scales with the maximal delay
$\tau_{\max}$. For unbounded delays, we propose a novel phased learning
strategy that accumulates reliable feedback over carefully scheduled intervals,
and establish a regret lower bound showing that our method is nearly optimal up
to logarithmic factors. Finally, we present experimental results to demonstrate
the efficiency of our algorithms under various delay scenarios.

Abstract: Federated inference, in the form of one-shot federated learning, edge
ensembles, or federated ensembles, has emerged as an attractive solution to
combine predictions from multiple models. This paradigm enables each model to
remain local and proprietary while a central server queries them and aggregates
predictions. Yet, the robustness of federated inference has been largely
neglected, leaving them vulnerable to even simple attacks. To address this
critical gap, we formalize the problem of robust federated inference and
provide the first robustness analysis of this class of methods. Our analysis of
averaging-based aggregators shows that the error of the aggregator is small
either when the dissimilarity between honest responses is small or the margin
between the two most probable classes is large. Moving beyond linear averaging,
we show that problem of robust federated inference with non-linear aggregators
can be cast as an adversarial machine learning problem. We then introduce an
advanced technique using the DeepSet aggregation model, proposing a novel
composition of adversarial training and test-time robust aggregation to
robustify non-linear aggregators. Our composition yields significant
improvements, surpassing existing robust aggregation methods by 4.7 - 22.2% in
accuracy points across diverse benchmarks.

Conclusion: 精心设计的离散化和上下文选择可以在保持基于提示的AMC优势的同时，显著降低推理成本，实现实际闭环使用。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) can perform Automatic Modulation Classification
(AMC) in an open-set manner without LLM fine-tuning when equipped with
carefully designed in-context prompts~\cite{rostami2025plug}. Building on this
prior work, we target the practical bottlenecks of long prompt contexts and
large model sizes that impede in-the-loop deployment. We present Discretized
Statistics in-Context Automatic Modulation Classification (DiSC-AMC), a token-
and parameter-efficient variant that: (i) discretizes higher-order statistics
and cumulants into compact symbolic tokens, (ii) prunes the exemplar list via a
lightweight k-top neural prefilter and filters misleading/low-impact features
using rationales extracted from prior LLM responses, and (iii) enforces
label-only predictions through a calibrated prompt template. Together, these
changes reduce both input/output tokens and the model parameter footprint by
more than half while maintaining competitive accuracy. On synthetic AMC with
ten modulation types under noise, a 7B \textit{DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen}
baseline achieves 5.2% accuracy, whereas our system, using an approximately
5B-parameter \textit{Gemini-2.5-Flash}~\cite{comanici2025gemini} model, attains
45.5% accuracy. These results demonstrate that careful discretization and
context selection can cut inference cost by over 2x while preserving the
advantages of prompt-based AMC and enabling practical in-the-loop use.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been demonstrating increasingly strong
reasoning capability with their chain-of-thoughts (CoT), which are routinely
used by humans to judge answer quality. This reliance creates a powerful yet
fragile basis for trust. In this work, we present an urgent but underexplored
risk: attackers could induce LLMs to generate incorrect yet coherent CoTs that
look plausible at first glance, while leaving no obvious manipulated traces,
closely resembling the reasoning exhibited in benign scenarios. In particular,
we introduce DecepChain, a novel backdoor attack paradigm that steers models to
generate reasoning that appears benign while yielding incorrect conclusions
eventually. At a high level, DecepChain exploits LLMs' own hallucination and
amplifies it by fine-tuning on naturally erroneous rollouts generated by the
model itself and then reinforces it via Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO) with a flipped reward on triggered inputs, plus a plausibility
regularizer to preserve fluent, benign-looking reasoning. Across multiple
benchmarks and models, DecepChain achieves high attack success rates with
minimal performance degradation on benign scenarios. Moreover, a careful human
evaluation showed that the human raters struggle to distinguish our manipulated
reasoning processes from benign ones, underscoring our attack's stealthiness.
Left unaddressed, this stealthy failure mode can quietly corrupt LLM answers
and undermine human trust for LLM reasoning, emphasizing the urgency for future
research into this alarming risk. Project page: https://decepchain.github.io/.

Abstract: The exponential growth of internet generated data has fueled advancements in
artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML), and deep learning (DL) for
extracting actionable insights in marketing,telecom, and health sectors. This
chapter explores ML applications across three domains namely healthcare,
marketing, and telecommunications, with a primary focus on developing a
framework for optimal ML algorithm selection. In healthcare, the framework
addresses critical challenges such as cardiovascular disease prediction
accounting for 28.1% of global deaths and fetal health classification into
healthy or unhealthy states, utilizing three datasets. ML algorithms are
categorized into eager, lazy, and hybrid learners, selected based on dataset
attributes, performance metrics (accuracy, precision, recall), and Akaike
Information Criterion (AIC) scores. For validation, eight datasets from the
three sectors are employed in the experiments. The key contribution is a
recommendation framework that identifies the best ML model according to input
attributes, balancing performance evaluation and model complexity to enhance
efficiency and accuracy in diverse real-world applications. This approach
bridges gaps in automated model selection, offering practical implications for
interdisciplinary ML deployment.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种无需跳跃连接就能稳定高效训练Transformer的方法，通过理论分析和精心设计的初始化策略，在视觉Transformer上实现了优于含跳跃连接基线的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然跳跃连接能稳定Transformer的训练，但它们破坏了表示的层次结构。本文旨在探索是否可以在不依赖跳跃连接的情况下高效训练Transformer，同时保持更好的层次表示。

Method: 通过分析无跳跃连接的Transformer块的雅可比矩阵，揭示了跳跃连接改善条件数的机制，并提出了一种原则性的初始化策略来恢复其稳定化效益。

Result: 在监督和自监督设置下，使用该初始化方法训练的无跳跃连接ViT克服了通常的优化障碍，学习了更丰富的层次表示，并在密集预测基准上超越了包含跳跃连接的强基线。

Conclusion: 跳跃连接不是训练ViT的基本要求，该方法为视觉模型中的层次表示学习开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Transformers have achieved remarkable success across a wide range of
applications, a feat often attributed to their scalability. Yet training them
without skip (residual) connections remains notoriously difficult. While skips
stabilize optimization, they also disrupt the hierarchical structure of
representations, raising the long-standing question of whether transformers can
be trained efficiently without them. In this work, we address this problem by
analyzing the Jacobian of a skipless transformer block, showing why skips
improve conditioning and revealing that their stabilization benefits can be
recovered through a principled initialization strategy. Building on this
insight, we introduce the first method that enables stable and efficient
training of skipless transformers without altering the standard architecture.
We validate our approach on Vision Transformers (ViTs) in both supervised and
self-supervised settings, demonstrating that skipless ViTs trained with our
initialization overcome the usual optimization barriers, learn richer
hierarchical representations, and outperform strong baselines, that incorporate
skip connections, on dense prediction benchmarks. These results show that skip
connections are not a fundamental requirement for training ViTs and open new
avenues for hierarchical representation learning in vision models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为PPT的新框架，通过集成辅助奖励预测器和基于预测误差的内在好奇心信号，来改善决策预训练变换器在分布外环境中的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有决策预训练变换器在超出预训练数据分布时泛化能力不足，需要探索缓解这一限制的方法。

Method: 提出了上下文好奇心正则化方法，在离线预训练中引入基于预测误差的内在好奇心信号，并构建PPT框架，通过辅助奖励预测器鼓励更广泛的探索。

Result: 在高斯多臂老虎机概念验证实验中，PPT显示出更好的鲁棒性，特别是在预训练数据多样性有限且测试环境奖励方差较高时，能够缓解DPT的性能下降。

Conclusion: 虽然离线数据质量仍然至关重要，但好奇心驱动的预训练为增强上下文强化学习智能体的分布外泛化能力提供了一个有前景的方向。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) continue to grow in capability, there is
increasing interest in incorporating them into decision-making tasks. A common
pipeline for this is Decision-Pretrained Transformers (DPTs). However, existing
training methods for DPTs often struggle to generalize beyond their pretraining
data distribution. To explore mitigation of this limitation, we propose
in-context curiosity -- a lightweight, exploration-inspired regularizer for
offline pretraining -- and introduce the Prediction-Powered Transformer (PPT)
framework. PPT augments DPT with an auxiliary reward predictor, using
prediction error as an intrinsic curiosity signal to encourage broader
exploration during training. In proof-of-concept experiments on Gaussian
multi-armed bandits, PPT shows improved robustness: it moderates the
performance degradation observed in DPT when test environments exhibit higher
variance in reward, particularly when pretraining data has limited diversity.
While the quality of offline data remain fundamental, our preliminary results
suggest that curiosity-driven pretraining offers a promising direction for
enhancing out-of-distribution generalization in in-context RL agents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于CMDPs缺乏对所有初始状态分布的通用最优策略，每次初始分布变化都需要重新求解，这增加了计算复杂度。研究初始分布变化对最优值的影响有助于理解CMDPs的敏感性。

Method: 使用CMDPs的对偶分析和线性规划的扰动分析来推导最优值随初始分布变化的界限。

Result: 得出了CMDPs最优值随初始分布变化的界限，并展示了如何用这些界限分析策略遗憾。

Conclusion: 通过理论分析为CMDPs在初始分布变化时的敏感性提供了量化工具，有助于评估策略在分布变化下的性能表现。

Abstract: Constrained Markov Decision Processes (CMDPs) are notably more complex to
solve than standard MDPs due to the absence of universally optimal policies
across all initial state distributions. This necessitates re-solving the CMDP
whenever the initial distribution changes. In this work, we analyze how the
optimal value of CMDPs varies with different initial distributions, deriving
bounds on these variations using duality analysis of CMDPs and perturbation
analysis in linear programming. Moreover, we show how such bounds can be used
to analyze the regret of a given policy due to unknown variations of the
initial distribution.

TL;DR: Kanzi是一个基于流的蛋白质结构tokenizer，使用扩散自编码器和流匹配损失来简化蛋白质结构的tokenization和生成过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有蛋白质结构tokenization方法依赖于定制组件，虽然具有空间对称性不变性，但优化和扩展困难。

Method: 采用扩散自编码器框架，使用流匹配损失，用全局坐标替代基于框架的表示，用标准注意力替代SE(3)-不变注意力操作。

Result: 该方法训练出参数效率更高的模型，在重建指标上优于现有tokenizer，且模型规模和训练成本大幅降低。自回归模型在token生成上优于类似方法，但尚未达到最先进连续扩散模型的性能。

Conclusion: Kanzi简化了蛋白质结构tokenizer的设计，实现了更稳定高效的训练，为蛋白质结构的多模态建模提供了新思路。

Abstract: Protein structure tokenizers enable the creation of multimodal models of
protein structure, sequence, and function. Current approaches to protein
structure tokenization rely on bespoke components that are invariant to spatial
symmetries, but that are challenging to optimize and scale. We present Kanzi, a
flow-based tokenizer for tokenization and generation of protein structures.
Kanzi consists of a diffusion autoencoder trained with a flow matching loss. We
show that this approach simplifies several aspects of protein structure
tokenizers: frame-based representations can be replaced with global
coordinates, complex losses are replaced with a single flow matching loss, and
SE(3)-invariant attention operations can be replaced with standard attention.
We find that these changes stabilize the training of parameter-efficient models
that outperform existing tokenizers on reconstruction metrics at a fraction of
the model size and training cost. An autoregressive model trained with Kanzi
outperforms similar generative models that operate over tokens, although it
does not yet match the performance of state-of-the-art continuous diffusion
models. Code is available here: https://github.com/rdilip/kanzi/.

TL;DR: AReUReDi是一种离散优化算法，通过结合Tchebycheff标量化、局部平衡提议和退火Metropolis-Hastings更新，在多目标序列设计中保证收敛到帕累托前沿。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有生成框架主要在连续空间中运行且仅支持单目标指导，而离散方法缺乏多目标帕累托最优性保证，需要开发能够同时优化多个冲突目标的序列设计方法。

Method: 基于Rectified Discrete Flows (ReDi)，结合Tchebycheff标量化、局部平衡提议和退火Metropolis-Hastings更新，在保持分布不变性的同时偏向帕累托最优状态采样。

Result: 在肽和SMILES序列设计中，AReUReDi同时优化多达五个治疗特性（亲和力、溶解度、溶血性、半衰期和非污染性），优于进化和基于扩散的基线方法。

Conclusion: AReUReDi建立了一个强大的基于序列的多特性生物分子生成框架，具有理论保证的帕累托前沿收敛性。

Abstract: Designing sequences that satisfy multiple, often conflicting, objectives is a
central challenge in therapeutic and biomolecular engineering. Existing
generative frameworks largely operate in continuous spaces with
single-objective guidance, while discrete approaches lack guarantees for
multi-objective Pareto optimality. We introduce AReUReDi (Annealed Rectified
Updates for Refining Discrete Flows), a discrete optimization algorithm with
theoretical guarantees of convergence to the Pareto front. Building on
Rectified Discrete Flows (ReDi), AReUReDi combines Tchebycheff scalarization,
locally balanced proposals, and annealed Metropolis-Hastings updates to bias
sampling toward Pareto-optimal states while preserving distributional
invariance. Applied to peptide and SMILES sequence design, AReUReDi
simultaneously optimizes up to five therapeutic properties (including affinity,
solubility, hemolysis, half-life, and non-fouling) and outperforms both
evolutionary and diffusion-based baselines. These results establish AReUReDi as
a powerful, sequence-based framework for multi-property biomolecule generation.

Motivation: 持续学习面临数据分布漂移的挑战，传统Transformer架构在持续学习场景中容易失去塑性和发生灾难性遗忘

Method: 提出仅查询注意力机制，丢弃键和值，但保留Transformer架构的核心归纳偏置，并与元学习建立概念联系

Result: 在持续学习场景中，简化机制显著缓解塑性损失和灾难性遗忘，优于基线方法，通过Hessian谱分析发现保持高曲率秩的模型能更好保持塑性

Conclusion: 完整注意力对于在持续学习中捕获元学习益处可能并非必需，仅查询注意力机制能有效应对持续学习挑战

Abstract: Continual learning involves learning from a stream of data without repetition
of data points, a scenario that is inherently complex due to distributional
shift across tasks. We propose a query-only attention mechanism that discards
keys and values, yet preserves the core inductive bias of transformer
architectures. In continual learning scenarios, this simplified mechanism
significantly mitigates both loss of plasticity and catastrophic forgetting,
outperforming baselines such as selective re-initialization. We establish a
conceptual link between query-only attention, full transformer attention, and
model agnostic meta-learning, framing them as instances of meta-learning. We
further provide intuition for why query-based models and attention networks
help preserve plasticity in continual settings. Finally, through preliminary
Hessian spectrum analysis, we observe that models maintaining higher curvature
rank across tasks tend to retain plasticity. Our findings suggest that full
attention may not be essential for capturing the benefits of meta-learning in
continual learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM能够生成可解释的符号控制策略，但无法有效分离策略的功能结构和数值参数，导致搜索过程缓慢低效

Method: 将结构合成与参数优化解耦：LLM迭代生成程序功能结构，同时使用单独的优化循环对候选程序的数值参数进行局部优化

Result: 在控制任务上实现了更高的回报和更好的样本效率，相比纯LLM引导搜索有显著提升

Conclusion: 结合符号程序合成与数值优化能够产生既可解释又高性能的策略，弥合了语言模型引导设计与经典控制调优之间的差距

Abstract: Large Language models (LLMs) have shown promise as generators of symbolic
control policies, producing interpretable program-like representations through
iterative search. However, these models are not capable of separating the
functional structure of a policy from the numerical values it is parametrized
by, thus making the search process slow and inefficient. We propose a hybrid
approach that decouples structural synthesis from parameter optimization by
introducing an additional optimization layer for local parameter search. In our
method, the numerical parameters of LLM-generated programs are extracted and
optimized numerically to maximize task performance. With this integration, an
LLM iterates over the functional structure of programs, while a separate
optimization loop is used to find a locally optimal set of parameters
accompanying candidate programs. We evaluate our method on a set of control
tasks, showing that it achieves higher returns and improved sample efficiency
compared to purely LLM-guided search. We show that combining symbolic program
synthesis with numerical optimization yields interpretable yet high-performing
policies, bridging the gap between language-model-guided design and classical
control tuning. Our code is available at

Motivation: 为了解决图分类任务中现有方法缺乏可解释性的问题，开发一个既能保持高准确性又能提供可解释预测的图学习架构。

Method: 结合领域特定编程语言GDL和神经网络，通过GDL层生成表达性强且可解释的图表示，使现有模型解释技术能够直接应用。

Result: 在大多数图分类基准数据集上达到高准确率，优于主流图学习方法如GNNs；应用现有解释技术能产生高质量预测解释；包含解释成本的总成本较低。

Conclusion: GDLNN成功实现了图分类任务中准确性和可解释性的平衡，为图机器学习提供了新的有效解决方案。

Abstract: We present GDLNN, a new graph machine learning architecture, for graph
classification tasks. GDLNN combines a domain-specific programming language,
called GDL, with neural networks. The main strength of GDLNN lies in its GDL
layer, which generates expressive and interpretable graph representations.
Since the graph representation is interpretable, existing model explanation
techniques can be directly applied to explain GDLNN's predictions. Our
evaluation shows that the GDL-based representation achieves high accuracy on
most graph classification benchmark datasets, outperforming dominant graph
learning methods such as GNNs. Applying an existing model explanation technique
also yields high-quality explanations of GDLNN's predictions. Furthermore, the
cost of GDLNN is low when the explanation cost is included.

TL;DR: 验证了一种贝叶斯双轴主动分类方法，用于工作记忆重建任务，通过高斯过程分类器控制空间负荷和特征绑定负荷，与传统自适应阶梯方法相比，在保持性能的同时揭示了更多的个体差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统认知实验通常只控制单一因素并使用标量总结性能，需要开发能够同时控制多个因素并揭示因素间交互作用的更先进实验设计方法。

Method: 使用贝叶斯高斯过程概率分类器，在沉浸式虚拟测试环境中进行5x5工作记忆重建任务，同时控制空间负荷L（占用瓦片数）和特征绑定负荷K（不同颜色数），通过后验不确定性指导刺激获取。

Result: 与传统自适应阶梯方法相比，新方法在性能上相当（组内相关系数0.755），但能揭示空间负荷与特征绑定之间的个体差异，且仅需约30个样本即可准确拟合完整模型，收敛速度更快。

Conclusion: 贝叶斯双轴主动分类方法为认知实验提供了更丰富的信息获取能力，能够有效揭示多因素交互作用，且具有高效的数据收集效率。

Abstract: While adaptive experimental design has outgrown one-dimensional,
staircase-based adaptations, most cognitive experiments still control a single
factor and summarize performance with a scalar. We show a validation of a
Bayesian, two-axis, active-classification approach, carried out in an immersive
virtual testing environment for a 5-by-5 working-memory reconstruction task.
Two variables are controlled: spatial load L (number of occupied tiles) and
feature-binding load K (number of distinct colors) of items. Stimulus
acquisition is guided by posterior uncertainty of a nonparametric Gaussian
Process (GP) probabilistic classifier, which outputs a surface over (L, K)
rather than a single threshold or max span value. In a young adult population,
we compare GP-driven Adaptive Mode (AM) with a traditional adaptive staircase
Classic Mode (CM), which varies L only at K = 3. Parity between the methods is
achieved for this cohort, with an intraclass coefficient of 0.755 at K = 3.
Additionally, AM reveals individual differences in interactions between spatial
load and feature binding. AM estimates converge more quickly than other
sampling strategies, demonstrating that only about 30 samples are required for
accurate fitting of the full model.

Method: 开发了模块化混合模型架构搜索框架Composer，在小规模探索模型架构，并通过提出的扩展策略将表现最佳的架构扩展到更大规模。

Result: 发现的新混合LLM架构在350M-3B参数规模下验证损失持续降低，下游任务评估准确率提升达2.8-8.3%（平均1.1-3.1%），同时提高了训练和推理效率。

Conclusion: Composer框架能够有效发现高性能混合模型架构，在多个规模下都优于现有基准模型，证明了自动化架构搜索的价值。

Abstract: Hybrid model architectures that combine computational primitives (e.g.,
Attention, MLP) in different ratios have shown promising performance beyond
Transformers. Some studies have shown that different interleavings of
primitives can affect model quality as well. However, prior works explore the
hybrid model architecture design space manually. Due to the large design space
and training costs, discovering hybrid models that combine key computational
primitives for pre-training is challenging. In this work, we take a principled
approach in designing a modular hybrid model architecture search framework --
Composer. Composer explores model architectures at a small scale and
extrapolates the top-performing model architectures to a larger scale using our
proposed scaling strategies. Using Composer, we discover new hybrid LLM
architectures that outperform Llama 3.2. Compared to Llama 3.2 and previous
state-of-the-art baselines, the new model architectures consistently reduce
validation loss at parameter scales of 350M-3B and improve evaluation accuracy
on the downstream tasks by up to 2.8-8.3% (1.1-3.1% on average) while improving
both training and inference efficiency.

Conclusion: 该方法为概率张量网络学习提供了高效稳定的解决方案，显著提升了计算性能和应用范围。

Abstract: Tensor networks (TNs) enable compact representations of large tensors through
shared parameters. Their use in probabilistic modeling is particularly
appealing, as probabilistic tensor networks (PTNs) allow for tractable
computation of marginals. However, existing approaches for learning parameters
of PTNs are either computationally demanding and not fully compatible with
automatic differentiation frameworks, or numerically unstable. In this work, we
propose a conceptually simple approach for learning PTNs efficiently, that is
numerically stable. We show our method provides significant improvements in
time and space complexity, achieving 10x reduction in latency for generative
modeling on the MNIST dataset. Furthermore, our approach enables learning of
distributions with 10x more variables than previous approaches when applied to
a variety of density estimation benchmarks. Our code is publicly available at

Motivation: 需要从噪声、不规则采样的轨迹中学习物理一致的连续时间动力学，同时获得哈密顿量的不确定性估计。

Conclusion: MS-PHS GP能够有效学习物理一致的动力学，提供哈密顿量的不确定性估计，并在基准测试中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: We propose the multistep port-Hamiltonian Gaussian process (MS-PHS GP) to
learn physically consistent continuous-time dynamics and a posterior over the
Hamiltonian from noisy, irregularly-sampled trajectories. By placing a GP prior
on the Hamiltonian surface $H$ and encoding variable-step multistep integrator
constraints as finite linear functionals, MS-PHS GP enables closed-form
conditioning of both the vector field and the Hamiltonian surface without
latent states, while enforcing energy balance and passivity by design. We state
a finite-sample vector-field bound that separates the estimation and
variable-step discretization terms. Lastly, we demonstrate improved
vector-field recovery and well-calibrated Hamiltonian uncertainty on
mass-spring, Van der Pol, and Duffing benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在微调过程中，从目标分布中通常只能获得少量样本，而现有的数据选择方法效率较低，需要为每个训练样本进行推理计算。

Method: 反转训练和验证集的角色：先在训练池上进行推理，然后在验证集上微调后再次在训练池上推理，选择预测变化最大的样本。

Result: 在指令调优和命名实体识别任务上的实验表明，该方法在大多数情况下比现有方法获得更低的测试对数损失。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种更简单、更快速的数据选择策略，通过关注微调对训练样本预测的影响，能够有效识别对目标分布最有用的样本。

Abstract: State-of-the-art machine learning often follows a two-stage process:
$(i)$~pre-training on large, general-purpose datasets; $(ii)$~fine-tuning on
task-specific data. In fine-tuning, selecting training examples that closely
reflect the target distribution is crucial. However, it is often the case that
only a few samples are available from the target distribution. Existing data
selection methods treat these target samples as a validation set and estimate
the effect of adding or removing a single sample from the training pool by
performing inference on the validation set.
  We propose a simpler and faster alternative that inverts the usual role of
train and validation: we perform inference on the training pool before and
after fine-tuning on the validation set. We then select samples whose
predictions change the most. Our key insight is that the training samples most
affected by fine-tuning on a small validation set tend to be the most
beneficial for reducing test loss on the target distribution. Experiments on
instruction tuning and named entity recognition tasks show that, in most cases,
our method achieves lower test log-loss than state-of-the-art approaches. We
support our findings with theoretical analysis.

Motivation: 解决认知评估中数据稀疏或不完整条件下的参数估计问题，提高评估效率。

Method: 开发DLVM模型整合多任务和个体观察数据，结合DALE自适应采样策略优化信息获取。

Result: DLVM在数据量较少时显著优于IMLE，收敛更快；DALE在前80次试验中优于随机采样和固定测试组合。

Abstract: Estimation (IMLE). DLVM integrates observations across multiple executive
function tasks and individuals, allowing parameter estimation even under sparse
or incomplete data conditions. DLVM consistently outperformed IMLE, especially
under with smaller amounts of data, and converges faster to highly accurate
estimates of the true distributions. In a second set of analyses, DALE
adaptively guided sampling to maximize information gain, outperforming random
sampling and fixed test batteries, particularly within the first 80 trials.
These findings establish the advantages of combining DLVMs cross-task inference
with DALEs optimal adaptive sampling, providing a principled basis for more
efficient cognitive assessments.

TL;DR: 提出Graph2Region方法，将图节点表示为封闭区域，通过区域重叠近似最大公共子图，同时计算图编辑距离，在保持效率的同时显著提升相似度计算精度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有神经网络方法在图相似度计算中存在的计算代价高、无法有效利用图结构信息的问题

Method: 将节点表示为封闭区域，通过区域形状捕获图结构，体积反映图大小，利用区域重叠近似MCS，不相交部分作为GED代理

Result: 在MCS相似度学习中相对准确率提升60%，同时高效预测MCS和GED相似度

Conclusion: G2R方法能够同时计算MCS和GED相似度，提供全面的图相似度评估，在准确性和效率方面均表现优异

Abstract: Graph similarity is critical in graph-related tasks such as graph retrieval,
where metrics like maximum common subgraph (MCS) and graph edit distance (GED)
are commonly used. However, exact computations of these metrics are known to be
NP-Hard. Recent neural network-based approaches approximate the similarity
score in embedding spaces to alleviate the computational burden, but they
either involve expensive pairwise node comparisons or fail to effectively
utilize structural and scale information of graphs. To tackle these issues, we
propose a novel geometric-based graph embedding method called Graph2Region
(G2R). G2R represents nodes as closed regions and recovers their adjacency
patterns within graphs in the embedding space. By incorporating the node
features and adjacency patterns of graphs, G2R summarizes graph regions, i.e.,
graph embeddings, where the shape captures the underlying graph structures and
the volume reflects the graph size. Consequently, the overlap between graph
regions can serve as an approximation of MCS, signifying similar node regions
and adjacency patterns. We further analyze the relationship between MCS and GED
and propose using disjoint parts as a proxy for GED similarity. This analysis
enables concurrent computation of MCS and GED, incorporating local and global
structural information. Experimental evaluation highlights G2R's competitive
performance in graph similarity computation. It achieves up to a 60.0\%
relative accuracy improvement over state-of-the-art methods in MCS similarity
learning, while maintaining efficiency in both training and inference.
Moreover, G2R showcases remarkable capability in predicting both MCS and GED
similarities simultaneously, providing a holistic assessment of graph
similarity. Code available at https://github.com/liuzhouyang/Graph2Region.

*Hongkang Li,Songtao Lu,Xiaodong Cui,Pin-Yu Chen,Meng Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文首次对单层Mamba模型的训练动态和上下文学习泛化能力进行了理论分析，发现Mamba通过线性注意力层选择信息丰富的上下文示例，并通过非线性门控层抑制异常值的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mamba模型在计算效率上优于Transformer模型且性能相当，但其理论理解因非线性门控机制而受限。本文旨在从理论上分析Mamba的训练动态和上下文学习能力。

Method: 分析单层Mamba模型（包含线性注意力组件和非线性门控层）的训练动态，并在包含加性异常值的提示下研究其上下文学习泛化能力。

Result: Mamba利用线性注意力层选择信息丰富的上下文示例，通过非线性门控层抑制异常值影响。虽然收敛可能需要更多训练迭代，但Mamba在异常值比例超过线性Transformer容忍阈值时仍能保持准确预测。

Conclusion: Mamba模型在上下文学习中具有鲁棒性，能够有效处理异常值，这一理论发现得到了实证实验的支持。

Abstract: The Mamba model has gained significant attention for its computational
advantages over Transformer-based models, while achieving comparable
performance across a wide range of language tasks. Like Transformers, Mamba
exhibits in-context learning (ICL) capabilities, i.e., making predictions for
new tasks based on a prompt containing input-label pairs and a query, without
requiring fine-tuning. Despite its empirical success, the theoretical
understanding of Mamba remains limited, largely due to the nonlinearity
introduced by its gating mechanism. To the best of our knowledge, this paper
presents the first theoretical analysis of the training dynamics of a one-layer
Mamba model, which consists of a linear attention component followed by a
nonlinear gating layer, and its ICL generalization on unseen binary
classification tasks, even when the prompt includes additive outliers. Our
analysis shows that Mamba leverages the linear attention layer to select
informative context examples and uses the nonlinear gating layer to suppress
the influence of outliers. By establishing and comparing to the analysis of
linear Transformers under the same setting, we show that although Mamba may
require more training iterations to converge, it maintains accurate predictions
even when the proportion of outliers exceeds the threshold that a linear
Transformer can tolerate. These theoretical findings are supported by empirical
experiments.

*Zhouyang Liu,Ning Liu,Yixin Chen,Jiezhong He,Menghan Jia,Dongsheng Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: NC-Iso是一种新颖的图神经网络架构，通过保持节点根子树中特征的相对位置来解决子图匹配中的尺度差异问题，并引入相似性优势比增强度量来提高匹配对的排序能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于GNN的子图匹配方法存在两个主要问题：1）编码过程中图对之间的尺度差异，因为它们关注特征计数但忽略了节点根子树中特征的相对位置；2）铰链距离度量对匹配图对缺乏区分能力，限制了排序应用。

Method: NC-Iso通过构建节点根子树内相邻梯队之间的层次依赖关系来保持特征的相对位置，确保匹配图对在特征计数符合包含约束的同时保持一致的层次结构。同时引入相似性优势比增强度量来量化图对之间相似性相对于不相似性的优势程度。

Result: 在九个数据集上的实证结果表明，NC-Iso在保持时间效率的同时，验证了其有效性、泛化能力、可扩展性和可迁移性，为子图检索提供了更具区分性的神经子图匹配解决方案。

Conclusion: NC-Iso通过保持特征相对位置和引入增强的相似性度量，有效解决了现有GNN子图匹配方法的局限性，为子图检索任务提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: Subgraph matching is challenging as it necessitates time-consuming
combinatorial searches. Recent Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based approaches
address this issue by employing GNN encoders to extract graph information and
hinge distance measures to ensure containment constraints in the embedding
space. These methods significantly shorten the response time, making them
promising solutions for subgraph retrieval. However, they suffer from scale
differences between graph pairs during encoding, as they focus on feature
counts but overlook the relative positions of features within node-rooted
subtrees, leading to disturbed containment constraints and false predictions.
Additionally, their hinge distance measures lack discriminative power for
matched graph pairs, hindering ranking applications. We propose NC-Iso, a novel
GNN architecture for neural subgraph matching. NC-Iso preserves the relative
positions of features by building the hierarchical dependencies between
adjacent echelons within node-rooted subtrees, ensuring matched graph pairs
maintain consistent hierarchies while complying with containment constraints in
feature counts. To enhance the ranking ability for matched pairs, we introduce
a novel similarity dominance ratio-enhanced measure, which quantifies the
dominance of similarity over dissimilarity between graph pairs. Empirical
results on nine datasets validate the effectiveness, generalization ability,
scalability, and transferability of NC-Iso while maintaining time efficiency,
offering a more discriminative neural subgraph matching solution for subgraph
retrieval. Code available at https://github.com/liuzhouyang/NC-Iso.

*Xudong Zhu,Mohammad Mahdi Khalili,Zhihui Zhu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一个从字典学习推导稀疏自编码器的理论框架，揭示了现有SAE变体的局限性，并提出了新的AbsTopK SAE方法来解决双向概念表示问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有稀疏自编码器缺乏统一的理论推导框架，且其正则化器强制非负性，阻碍了单一特征表示双向概念（如男性vs女性）的能力。

Method: 通过展开稀疏编码的近端梯度方法构建理论框架，提出AbsTopK SAE，基于ℓ0稀疏约束对最大幅度激活进行硬阈值处理，保留正负激活。

Result: 在4个LLM和7个任务上的实验表明，AbsTopK提高了重建保真度、增强了解释性，使单个特征能够编码对比概念，性能匹配甚至超过需要标注数据的监督方法。

Conclusion: AbsTopK SAE通过保留双向激活解决了现有SAE的结构限制，提供了更丰富、更完整的语义表示，在多个任务上表现出色。

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as powerful techniques for
interpretability of large language models (LLMs), aiming to decompose hidden
states into meaningful semantic features. While several SAE variants have been
proposed, there remains no principled framework to derive SAEs from the
original dictionary learning formulation. In this work, we introduce such a
framework by unrolling the proximal gradient method for sparse coding. We show
that a single-step update naturally recovers common SAE variants, including
ReLU, JumpReLU, and TopK. Through this lens, we reveal a fundamental limitation
of existing SAEs: their sparsity-inducing regularizers enforce non-negativity,
preventing a single feature from representing bidirectional concepts (e.g.,
male vs. female). This structural constraint fragments semantic axes into
separate, redundant features, limiting representational completeness. To
address this issue, we propose AbsTopK SAE, a new variant derived from the
$\ell_0$ sparsity constraint that applies hard thresholding over the
largest-magnitude activations. By preserving both positive and negative
activations, AbsTopK uncovers richer, bidirectional conceptual representations.
Comprehensive experiments across four LLMs and seven probing and steering tasks
show that AbsTopK improves reconstruction fidelity, enhances interpretability,
and enables single features to encode contrasting concepts. Remarkably, AbsTopK
matches or even surpasses the Difference-in-Mean method, a supervised approach
that requires labeled data for each concept and has been shown in prior work to
outperform SAEs.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了ZO Fine-tuner，一种基于学习的零阶优化器，通过紧凑且内存高效的设计自动学习有效的扰动策略，显著降低LLM微调的GPU内存消耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有零阶方法依赖手工制作的静态采样策略，无法适应模型特定结构。观察到实践中只有少量基础模型及其衍生模型被广泛采用，因此为给定LLM学习一次优化器并在不同下游任务中重用是可行且高度可取的。

Method: 设计了一种学习型零阶优化器，支持每个LLM一次性训练，通过紧凑设计自动学习高效的扰动策略，将学习到学习(L2L)扩展到基础模型时代。

Result: 在4个LLM和7个数据集上的实验表明，ZO Fine-tuner在82.1%的任务-模型组合中优于先前的零阶基线方法。

Conclusion: ZO Fine-tuner展示了强大的性能和可扩展性，为高效LLM微调提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Zeroth-order optimizers have recently emerged as a practical approach for
fine-tuning large language models (LLMs), significantly reducing GPU memory
consumption compared to traditional first-order methods. Yet, existing
zeroth-order methods rely on hand-crafted, static sampling strategies that are
not adaptable to model-specific structures. To address this, we propose ZO
Fine-tuner, a learning-based zeroth-order optimizer for LLMs that automatically
learns efficient perturbation strategies through a compact and memory-efficient
design. Crucially, our approach is motivated by the observation that only a
small number of foundation models and their derivatives are widely adopted in
practice. Therefore, learning the optimizer once for a given LLM and reusing it
across diverse downstream tasks is both feasible and highly desirable.
Accordingly, ZO Fine-tuner is designed to scale learning to learn (L2L) to the
foundation-model era by supporting one-time training per LLM with minimal
overhead. Experiments on 4 LLMs and 7 datasets show that ZO Fine-tuner
outperforms prior zeroth-order baselines in 82.1\% of task-model combinations,
thereby demonstrating strong performance and scalability for efficient LLM
fine-tuning. Our code is available at

Conclusion: 临床上下文的整合对于实现临床对齐的自动化放射学报告生成至关重要，公开了数据集、代码和检查点以促进未来研究。

Abstract: Automated structured radiology report generation (SRRG) from chest X-ray
images offers significant potential to reduce workload of radiologists by
generating reports in structured formats that ensure clarity, consistency, and
adherence to clinical reporting standards. While radiologists effectively
utilize available clinical contexts in their diagnostic reasoning, existing
SRRG systems overlook these essential elements. This fundamental gap leads to
critical problems including temporal hallucinations when referencing
non-existent clinical contexts. To address these limitations, we propose
contextualized SRRG (C-SRRG) that comprehensively incorporates rich clinical
context for SRRG. We curate C-SRRG dataset by integrating comprehensive
clinical context encompassing 1) multi-view X-ray images, 2) clinical
indication, 3) imaging techniques, and 4) prior studies with corresponding
comparisons based on patient histories. Through extensive benchmarking with
state-of-the-art multimodal large language models, we demonstrate that
incorporating clinical context with the proposed C-SRRG significantly improves
report generation quality. We publicly release dataset, code, and checkpoints
to facilitate future research for clinically-aligned automated RRG at

TL;DR: PromptLoop是一个基于强化学习的插件式框架，通过多模态大语言模型在扩散模型采样过程中迭代更新提示，实现有效的奖励优化和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决基于强化学习的扩散模型微调在泛化性、组合性和抗奖励攻击鲁棒性方面的不足，以及现有提示优化方法未能充分利用强化学习序列特性的问题。

Method: 训练多模态大语言模型使用强化学习，基于扩散模型的中间潜在状态迭代更新提示，而不是直接修改扩散模型权重。

Result: 在多种奖励函数和扩散骨干网络上，PromptLoop实现了有效的奖励优化、对未见模型的泛化、与现有对齐方法的正交组合，并减轻了过优化和奖励攻击问题。

Conclusion: PromptLoop通过将潜在反馈融入逐步提示优化，在保持提示对齐灵活性的同时，实现了与Diffusion RL类似的结构类比，为扩散模型对齐提供了有效的模块化解决方案。

Abstract: Despite the recent progress, reinforcement learning (RL)-based fine-tuning of
diffusion models often struggles with generalization, composability, and
robustness against reward hacking. Recent studies have explored prompt
refinement as a modular alternative, but most adopt a feed-forward approach
that applies a single refined prompt throughout the entire sampling trajectory,
thereby failing to fully leverage the sequential nature of reinforcement
learning. To address this, here we introduce PromptLoop, a plug-and-play RL
framework that incorporates latent feedback into step-wise prompt refinement.
Rather than modifying diffusion model weights, a multimodal large language
model (MLLM) is trained with RL to iteratively update prompts based on
intermediate latent states of diffusion models. This design achieves a
structural analogy to the Diffusion RL approach, while retaining the
flexibility and generality of prompt-based alignment. Extensive experiments
across diverse reward functions and diffusion backbones demonstrate that
PromptLoop (i) achieves effective reward optimization, (ii) generalizes
seamlessly to unseen models, (iii) composes orthogonally with existing
alignment methods, and (iv) mitigates over-optimization and reward hacking.

TL;DR: SADA是一种样本感知动态数据增强方法，根据样本在模型优化中的动态影响力实时调整增强强度，解决了传统固定或随机增强方法在动态训练环境中与模型需求不匹配的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统数据增强方法使用固定或随机变换，但样本难度会随着模型泛化能力的变化而演变。如果不考虑这种动态性，会导致增强数据与模型训练需求不匹配，降低训练效果。

Method: 通过将样本梯度投影到累积模型更新方向并计算局部训练窗口内的时间方差，估计每个样本对模型优化的影响力。低方差样本增强更强以强调多样性，高方差样本增强更弱以保持语义保真度。

Result: 在各种基准数据集和模型架构上的实验显示SADA带来一致改进，包括细粒度任务上+7.3%和长尾数据集上+4.3%的提升。

Conclusion: SADA是一种轻量级、即插即用的方法，无需辅助模型或策略调优，能有效提升训练效果，具有很好的实用性和有效性。

Abstract: Data augmentation has been widely employed to improve the generalization of
deep neural networks. Most existing methods apply fixed or random
transformations. However, we find that sample difficulty evolves along with the
model's generalization capabilities in dynamic training environments. As a
result, applying uniform or stochastic augmentations, without accounting for
such dynamics, can lead to a mismatch between augmented data and the model's
evolving training needs, ultimately degrading training effectiveness. To
address this, we introduce SADA, a Sample-Aware Dynamic Augmentation that
performs on-the-fly adjustment of augmentation strengths based on each sample's
evolving influence on model optimization. Specifically, we estimate each
sample's influence by projecting its gradient onto the accumulated model update
direction and computing the temporal variance within a local training window.
Samples with low variance, indicating stable and consistent influence, are
augmented more strongly to emphasize diversity, while unstable samples receive
milder transformations to preserve semantic fidelity and stabilize learning.
Our method is lightweight, which does not require auxiliary models or policy
tuning. It can be seamlessly integrated into existing training pipelines as a
plug-and-play module. Experiments across various benchmark datasets and model
architectures show consistent improvements of SADA, including +7.3\% on
fine-grained tasks and +4.3\% on long-tailed datasets, highlighting the
method's effectiveness and practicality.

Conclusion: 素描激活存储为内存高效的神经网络训练和分析提供了可行路径。

Abstract: Neural network training relies on gradient computation through
backpropagation, yet memory requirements for storing layer activations present
significant scalability challenges. We present the first adaptation of
control-theoretic matrix sketching to neural network layer activations,
enabling memory-efficient gradient reconstruction in backpropagation. This work
builds on recent matrix sketching frameworks for dynamic optimization problems,
where similar state trajectory storage challenges motivate sketching
techniques. Our approach sketches layer activations using three complementary
sketch matrices maintained through exponential moving averages (EMA) with
adaptive rank adjustment, automatically balancing memory efficiency against
approximation quality. Empirical evaluation on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and
physics-informed neural networks demonstrates a controllable accuracy-memory
tradeoff. We demonstrate a gradient monitoring application on MNIST showing how
sketched activations enable real-time gradient norm tracking with minimal
memory overhead. These results establish that sketched activation storage
provides a viable path toward memory-efficient neural network training and
analysis.

Abstract: With rapid urbanization, predicting urban microclimates has become critical,
as it affects building energy demand and public health risks. However, existing
generative and homogeneous graph approaches fall short in capturing physical
consistency, spatial dependencies, and temporal variability. To address this,
we introduce UrbanGraph, a physics-informed framework integrating heterogeneous

vegetation evapotranspiration, shading, and convective diffusion -- while
modeling complex spatial dependencies among diverse urban entities and their
temporal evolution. We evaluate UrbanGraph on UMC4/12, a physics-based
simulation dataset covering diverse urban configurations and climates. Results
show that UrbanGraph improves $R^2$ by up to 10.8% and reduces FLOPs by 17.0%
over all baselines, with heterogeneous and dynamic graphs contributing 3.5% and
7.1% gains. Our dataset provides the first high-resolution benchmark for
spatio-temporal microclimate modeling, and our method extends to broader urban
heterogeneous dynamic computing tasks.

Abstract: Anomaly detection in spatiotemporal data is a challenging problem encountered
in a variety of applications, including video surveillance, medical imaging
data, and urban traffic monitoring. Existing anomaly detection methods focus
mainly on point anomalies and cannot deal with temporal and spatial
dependencies that arise in spatio-temporal data. Tensor-based anomaly detection
methods have been proposed to address this problem. Although existing methods
can capture dependencies across different modes, they are primarily supervised
and do not account for the specific structure of anomalies. Moreover, these
methods focus mainly on extracting anomalous features without providing any
statistical confidence. In this paper, we introduce an unsupervised
tensor-based anomaly detection method that simultaneously considers the sparse
and spatiotemporally smooth nature of anomalies. The anomaly detection problem
is formulated as a regularized robust low-rank + sparse tensor decomposition
where the total variation of the tensor with respect to the underlying spatial
and temporal graphs quantifies the spatiotemporal smoothness of the anomalies.
Once the anomalous features are extracted, we introduce a statistical anomaly
scoring framework that accounts for local spatio-temporal dependencies. The
proposed framework is evaluated on both synthetic and real data.

Motivation: 时间序列分布随时间变化的时间非平稳性给可靠预测带来根本性挑战。现有方法往往混淆时间变化和时间不变组件，导致面对分布偏移时性能不佳。

Method: 提出静态-动态分解框架：时间不变组件通过全局嵌入模块学习跨时间序列的持久表示；时间变化组件通过受信号处理全频谱分析启发的频域滤波机制处理。

Conclusion: TimeEmb通过有效的静态-动态解耦，为时间序列预测提供了一种高效且性能优越的解决方案，验证了分解方法的有效性。

Abstract: Temporal non-stationarity, the phenomenon that time series distributions
change over time, poses fundamental challenges to reliable time series
forecasting. Intuitively, the complex time series can be decomposed into two
factors, \ie time-invariant and time-varying components, which indicate static
and dynamic patterns, respectively. Nonetheless, existing methods often
conflate the time-varying and time-invariant components, and jointly learn the
combined long-term patterns and short-term fluctuations, leading to suboptimal
performance facing distribution shifts. To address this issue, we initiatively
propose a lightweight static-dynamic decomposition framework, TimeEmb, for time
series forecasting. TimeEmb innovatively separates time series into two
complementary components: (1) time-invariant component, captured by a novel
global embedding module that learns persistent representations across time
series, and (2) time-varying component, processed by an efficient
frequency-domain filtering mechanism inspired by full-spectrum analysis in
signal processing. Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that TimeEmb
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and requires fewer computational
resources. We conduct comprehensive quantitative and qualitative analyses to
verify the efficacy of static-dynamic disentanglement. This lightweight
framework can also improve existing time-series forecasting methods with simple
integration. To ease reproducibility, the code is available at

Abstract: The main challenge of continual learning is \textit{catastrophic forgetting}.
Because of processing data in one pass, online continual learning (OCL) is one
of the most difficult continual learning scenarios. To address catastrophic
forgetting in OCL, some existing studies use a rehearsal buffer to store
samples and replay them in the later learning process, other studies do not
store samples but assume a sequence of learning tasks so that the task
identities can be explored. However, storing samples may raise data security or
privacy concerns and it is not always possible to identify the boundaries
between learning tasks in one pass of data processing. It motivates us to
investigate rehearsal-free and task-free OCL (F2OCL). By integrating prompt
learning with an NCM classifier, this study has effectively tackled
catastrophic forgetting without storing samples and without usage of task
boundaries or identities. The extensive experimental results on two benchmarks
have demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method.

### [164] [Feature Identification via the Empirical NTK](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00468)

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本研究表明经验神经正切核(eNTK)的特征分析可以揭示训练后神经网络使用的特征。在两个标准机制可解释性玩具模型(TMS和模加法)中，eNTK显示出尖锐的谱悬崖，其顶部特征空间与真实特征对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索如何通过eNTK分析来发现神经网络使用的特征，并检测模型训练过程中的相变现象。

Method: 在两个标准玩具模型(Toy Models of Superposition和模加法MLP)上分析eNTK的谱特性，包括谱悬崖、特征空间对齐以及层间eNTK分析。

Result: eNTK在两种模型中都成功恢复了真实特征：在TMS中覆盖稀疏和密集机制，在模加法中恢复傅里叶特征族。层间eNTK能将特征定位到特定层，eNTK谱演化可诊断grokking相变。

Conclusion: eNTK分析为特征发现和小模型相变检测提供了实用的方法工具。

Abstract: We provide evidence that eigenanalysis of the empirical neural tangent kernel
(eNTK) can surface the features used by trained neural networks. Across two
standard toy models for mechanistic interpretability, Toy Models of
Superposition (TMS) and a 1-layer MLP trained on modular addition, we find that
the eNTK exhibits sharp spectral cliffs whose top eigenspaces align with
ground-truth features. In TMS, the eNTK recovers the ground-truth features in
both the sparse (high superposition) and dense regimes. In modular arithmetic,
the eNTK can be used to recover Fourier feature families. Moreover, we provide
evidence that a layerwise eNTK localizes features to specific layers and that
the evolution of the eNTK eigenspectrum can be used to diagnose the grokking
phase transition. These results suggest that eNTK analysis may provide a
practical handle for feature discovery and for detecting phase changes in small
models.

### [165] [Diagnosing Shortcut-Induced Rigidity in Continual Learning: The Einstellung Rigidity Index (ERI)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00475)
*Kai Gu,Weishi Shi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文分析了持续学习中捷径特征导致的认知定势效应，提出了Einstellung Rigidity Index (ERI)诊断指标来区分真实迁移和捷径依赖，发现在CIFAR-100基准测试中，持续学习方法比从头训练更快达到精度阈值但最终精度略低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络经常利用捷径特征（输入和标签间的偶然相关性），这会削弱鲁棒性和分布变化的可靠性。在持续学习中，捷径利用的后果会持续并加剧：从早期任务继承的权重使表示重用偏向于最容易满足先前标签的特征，这类似于认知定势效应。

Method: 引入Einstellung Rigidity Index (ERI)诊断指标，包含三个可解释方面：(i)适应延迟(AD)、(ii)性能赤字(PD)、(iii)相对次优特征依赖(SFR_rel)。在CIFAR-100持续学习基准上评估了多种方法，并在第二阶段故意添加虚假的洋红色补丁。

Result: 持续学习方法比从头训练基准更早达到精度阈值（负AD），但在有补丁的捷径类上最终精度略低（正PD）。掩蔽补丁提高了CL方法的精度，同时略微降低了从头训练基准，产生负SFR_rel，表明补丁在此设置中充当了CL模型的干扰项而非有用捷径。

Conclusion: 该模式表明，在这种设置中，补丁对持续学习模型起到了干扰作用，而不是有用的捷径。ERI指标能够有效诊断持续学习中的认知定势效应和捷径依赖问题。

Abstract: Deep neural networks frequently exploit shortcut features, defined as
incidental correlations between inputs and labels without causal meaning.
Shortcut features undermine robustness and reduce reliability under
distribution shifts. In continual learning (CL), the consequences of shortcut
exploitation can persist and intensify: weights inherited from earlier tasks
bias representation reuse toward whatever features most easily satisfied prior
labels, mirroring the cognitive Einstellung effect, a phenomenon where past
habits block optimal solutions. Whereas catastrophic forgetting erodes past
skills, shortcut-induced rigidity throttles the acquisition of new ones. We
introduce the Einstellung Rigidity Index (ERI), a compact diagnostic that
disentangles genuine transfer from cue-inflated performance using three
interpretable facets: (i) Adaptation Delay (AD), (ii) Performance Deficit (PD),
and (iii) Relative Suboptimal Feature Reliance (SFR_rel). On a two-phase
CIFAR-100 CL benchmark with a deliberately spurious magenta patch in Phase 2,
we evaluate Naive fine-tuning (SGD), online Elastic Weight Consolidation
(EWC_on), Dark Experience Replay (DER++), Gradient Projection Memory (GPM), and
Deep Generative Replay (DGR). Across these continual learning methods, we
observe that CL methods reach accuracy thresholds earlier than a Scratch-T2
baseline (negative AD) but achieve slightly lower final accuracy on patched
shortcut classes (positive PD). Masking the patch improves accuracy for CL
methods while slightly reducing Scratch-T2, yielding negative SFR_rel. This
pattern indicates the patch acted as a distractor for CL models in this setting
rather than a helpful shortcut.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DVD是一个基于潜在扩散模型的源自由域适应框架，通过训练扩散网络将噪声样本漂移回标签一致的表示，在无需访问源数据的情况下实现显式知识迁移。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有潜在扩散模型主要关注生成任务，其在判别性迁移方面的潜力尚未充分探索。本文旨在解决源自由域适应中无法访问原始源样本的核心挑战。

Method: DVD将源特征的标签信息编码到其潜在邻域中，通过高斯先验拟合k近邻，训练扩散网络将噪声样本漂移回标签一致表示。在适应阶段，从目标特征的潜在邻域采样，应用冻结的扩散模块生成源式线索，使用InfoNCE损失对齐目标编码器。

Result: 在标准SFDA基准测试中，DVD优于最先进方法。相同的潜在扩散模块还能提高源分类器在域内数据的准确性，并在监督分类和域泛化实验中提升性能。

Conclusion: DVD将潜在扩散模型重新解释为实用、保护隐私的显式知识迁移桥梁，解决了源自由域适应中先前方法未能解决的核心挑战。

Abstract: Recent work on latent diffusion models (LDMs) has focused almost exclusively
on generative tasks, leaving their potential for discriminative transfer
largely unexplored. We introduce Discriminative Vicinity Diffusion (DVD), a
novel LDM-based framework for a more practical variant of source-free domain
adaptation (SFDA): the source provider may share not only a pre-trained
classifier but also an auxiliary latent diffusion module, trained once on the
source data and never exposing raw source samples. DVD encodes each source
feature's label information into its latent vicinity by fitting a Gaussian
prior over its k-nearest neighbors and training the diffusion network to drift
noisy samples back to label-consistent representations. During adaptation, we
sample from each target feature's latent vicinity, apply the frozen diffusion
module to generate source-like cues, and use a simple InfoNCE loss to align the
target encoder to these cues, explicitly transferring decision boundaries
without source access. Across standard SFDA benchmarks, DVD outperforms
state-of-the-art methods. We further show that the same latent diffusion module
enhances the source classifier's accuracy on in-domain data and boosts
performance in supervised classification and domain generalization experiments.
DVD thus reinterprets LDMs as practical, privacy-preserving bridges for
explicit knowledge transfer, addressing a core challenge in source-free domain
adaptation that prior methods have yet to solve.

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于黑盒时间序列域适应（BBTSDA）的跨提示基础模型（CPFM），通过双分支网络结构和提示重建学习来解决时间序列数据的时空特性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有黑盒域适应方法主要针对视觉应用，无法直接应用于具有独特时空特性的时间序列数据，且尚未探索基础模型在黑盒时间序列域适应中的潜力。

Method: 构建基于时间序列基础模型的双分支网络结构，每个分支配备独特提示来捕捉数据分布的不同特征，在域适应阶段开发提示和输入级别的重建学习。

Result: 在三个不同应用领域的时间序列数据集上的严格实验证明，CPFM相比竞争对手取得了显著提升的结果。

Conclusion: CPFM方法有效解决了黑盒时间序列域适应问题，利用基础模型克服时空动态特性，在多个数据集上表现出优越性能。

Abstract: The black-box domain adaptation (BBDA) topic is developed to address the
privacy and security issues where only an application programming interface
(API) of the source model is available for domain adaptations. Although the
BBDA topic has attracted growing research attentions, existing works mostly
target the vision applications and are not directly applicable to the
time-series applications possessing unique spatio-temporal characteristics. In
addition, none of existing approaches have explored the strength of foundation
model for black box time-series domain adaptation (BBTSDA). This paper proposes
a concept of Cross-Prompt Foundation Model (CPFM) for the BBTSDA problems. CPFM
is constructed under a dual branch network structure where each branch is
equipped with a unique prompt to capture different characteristics of data
distributions. In the domain adaptation phase, the reconstruction learning
phase in the prompt and input levels is developed. All of which are built upon
a time-series foundation model to overcome the spatio-temporal dynamic. Our
rigorous experiments substantiate the advantage of CPFM achieving improved
results with noticeable margins from its competitors in three time-series
datasets of different application domains.

TL;DR: 该研究比较了LLM推理的两种架构：双模型潜在推理与统一软嵌入基线。在匹配潜在token预算下，统一方法几乎达到双模型性能，表明当前双模型设计主要增加计算而非显著改善推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLM推理应该采用分离模块还是单一模型架构，测试双架构潜在推理中增加通道容量和联合微调两种假设是否能改善潜在通信。

Method: 使用GPT-2和Qwen-3模型，在匹配潜在token预算下比较双模型架构（Base与Coprocessor交换潜在消息）与统一软嵌入基线，测试GSM8K、ProsQA和Countdown等任务。

Result: 联合微调（H2）表现最强，增加通道容量（H1）收益有限。统一基线几乎匹配H2并超越H1，潜在token预算扩展未能改善鲁棒性，潜在空间分析显示有限的专业化。

Conclusion: 双模型潜在推理在原理上有前景，但需要明确塑造潜在空间用于算法规划的目标和通信机制。

Abstract: Should LLM reasoning live in a separate module, or within a single model's
forward pass and representational space? We study dual-architecture latent
reasoning, where a fluent Base exchanges latent messages with a Coprocessor,
and test two hypotheses aimed at improving latent communication over Liu et al.
(2024): (H1) increase channel capacity; (H2) learn communication via joint
finetuning. Under matched latent-token budgets on GPT-2 and Qwen-3, H2 is
consistently strongest while H1 yields modest gains. A unified soft-embedding
baseline, a single model with the same forward pass and shared representations,
using the same latent-token budget, nearly matches H2 and surpasses H1,
suggesting current dual designs mostly add compute rather than qualitatively
improving reasoning. Across GSM8K, ProsQA, and a Countdown stress test with
increasing branching factor, scaling the latent-token budget beyond small
values fails to improve robustness. Latent analyses show overlapping subspaces
with limited specialization, consistent with weak reasoning gains. We conclude
dual-model latent reasoning remains promising in principle, but likely requires
objectives and communication mechanisms that explicitly shape latent spaces for
algorithmic planning.

TL;DR: 提出DAV框架，将扩散对齐建模为变分期望最大化过程，通过E步和M步交替优化，在保持多样性的同时最大化奖励。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于强化学习或直接反向传播的扩散对齐方法存在奖励过优化和模式崩溃问题，需要一种能同时优化奖励和保持多样性的方法。

Method: 采用变分期望最大化框架：E步通过测试时搜索生成多样且奖励对齐的样本；M步使用E步发现的样本精炼扩散模型。

Result: DAV在连续和离散任务（文本到图像合成和DNA序列设计）中都能有效优化奖励并保持多样性。

Conclusion: DAV框架成功解决了扩散对齐中的奖励过优化和模式崩溃问题，为扩散模型的下游任务优化提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion alignment aims to optimize diffusion models for the downstream
objective. While existing methods based on reinforcement learning or direct
backpropagation achieve considerable success in maximizing rewards, they often
suffer from reward over-optimization and mode collapse. We introduce Diffusion
Alignment as Variational Expectation-Maximization (DAV), a framework that
formulates diffusion alignment as an iterative process alternating between two
complementary phases: the E-step and the M-step. In the E-step, we employ
test-time search to generate diverse and reward-aligned samples. In the M-step,
we refine the diffusion model using samples discovered by the E-step. We
demonstrate that DAV can optimize reward while preserving diversity for both
continuous and discrete tasks: text-to-image synthesis and DNA sequence design.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 微分注意力(DA)通过减法结构抑制冗余上下文，减少幻觉，但增加了对抗攻击的脆弱性。研究发现负梯度对齐是敏感性放大的关键因素，导致梯度范数增加和局部Lipschitz常数升高。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究微分注意力机制在提高任务相关焦点同时，是否引入了对抗扰动的结构脆弱性，探索注意力机制选择性与鲁棒性之间的权衡。

Method: 通过理论分析识别负梯度对齐机制，并在ViT/DiffViT和预训练CLIP/DiffCLIP上进行系统实验，涵盖五个数据集，评估攻击成功率、梯度对立和局部敏感性。

Result: DA机制相比标准注意力具有更高的攻击成功率、频繁的梯度对立和更强的局部敏感性。深度相关实验显示，堆叠DA层能通过深度相关噪声抵消衰减小扰动，但在大攻击预算下保护减弱。

Conclusion: 微分注意力在干净输入上改善了判别性焦点，但增加了对抗脆弱性，需要在未来注意力机制设计中同时考虑选择性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Differential Attention (DA) has been proposed as a refinement to standard
attention, suppressing redundant or noisy context through a subtractive
structure and thereby reducing contextual hallucination. While this design
sharpens task-relevant focus, we show that it also introduces a structural
fragility under adversarial perturbations. Our theoretical analysis identifies
negative gradient alignment-a configuration encouraged by DA's subtraction-as
the key driver of sensitivity amplification, leading to increased gradient
norms and elevated local Lipschitz constants. We empirically validate this
Fragile Principle through systematic experiments on ViT/DiffViT and evaluations
of pretrained CLIP/DiffCLIP, spanning five datasets in total. These results
demonstrate higher attack success rates, frequent gradient opposition, and
stronger local sensitivity compared to standard attention. Furthermore,
depth-dependent experiments reveal a robustness crossover: stacking DA layers
attenuates small perturbations via depth-dependent noise cancellation, though
this protection fades under larger attack budgets. Overall, our findings
uncover a fundamental trade-off: DA improves discriminative focus on clean
inputs but increases adversarial vulnerability, underscoring the need to
jointly design for selectivity and robustness in future attention mechanisms.

*Nandan Kumar Jha,Brandon Reagen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的光谱利用分析方法，发现前馈网络(FFN)的宽度扩展存在不对称光谱缩放规律：软秩随宽度呈完美幂律增长，而硬秩仅呈次线性增长且方差大，表明FFN增宽主要增加低能量尾方向，而主导模式子空间早期饱和。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有缩放定律关注模型大小与损失的关系，但忽视了组件如何利用其潜在空间。本文旨在研究FFN的宽度选择问题，将其重新表述为光谱利用问题。

Method: 使用轻量级诊断套件（硬秩、软秩、光谱集中度和复合光谱利用指数SUI），量化分析LLaMA、GPT-2和nGPT系列模型中有效激活的潜在方向数量。

Result: 发现不对称光谱缩放规律：软秩随FFN宽度呈几乎完美的幂律增长，硬秩仅呈次线性增长且方差高。在更大宽度下，方差进一步坍缩到狭窄子空间，导致大部分潜在空间未被充分利用。

Conclusion: 将FFN宽度选择重新表述为尾容量与主导模式容量之间的权衡，为推理高效的LLM设计提供具体指导。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) scale, the question is not only how large
they become, but how much of their capacity is effectively utilized. Existing
scaling laws relate model size to loss, yet overlook how components exploit
their latent space. We study feed-forward networks (FFNs) and recast width
selection as a spectral utilization problem. Using a lightweight diagnostic
suite -- Hard Rank (participation ratio), Soft Rank (Shannon rank), Spectral
Concentration, and the composite Spectral Utilization Index (SUI) -- we
quantify how many latent directions are meaningfully activated across LLaMA,
GPT-2, and nGPT families. Our key finding is an asymmetric spectral scaling
law: soft rank follows an almost perfect power law with FFN width, while hard
rank grows only sublinearly and with high variance. This asymmetry suggests
that widening FFNs mostly adds low-energy tail directions, while dominant-mode
subspaces saturate early. Moreover, at larger widths, variance further
collapses into a narrow subspace, leaving much of the latent space
under-utilized. These results recast FFN width selection as a principled
trade-off between tail capacity and dominant-mode capacity, offering concrete
guidance for inference-efficient LLM design.

Motivation: 准确预测预期寿命对于公共卫生和社会经济福祉至关重要，但由于人口、环境和医疗因素的复杂相互作用，这仍然具有挑战性。

Method: 使用来自WHO和UN的真实数据集，评估线性回归、回归决策树和随机森林三种模型，通过R²、MAE和RMSE指标评估性能，并进行特征重要性分析。

Result: 随机森林模型表现最佳（R² = 0.9423），显著优于其他两种模型。免疫接种率（白喉、麻疹）和人口属性（HIV/AIDS、成人死亡率）是预测预期寿命的关键驱动因素。

Conclusion: 集成方法与可解释性的结合能有效解决公共卫生挑战。未来研究应探索更先进的插补策略、替代算法和更新数据，以进一步提高预测准确性。

Abstract: Life expectancy is a fundamental indicator of population health and
socio-economic well-being, yet accurately forecasting it remains challenging
due to the interplay of demographic, environmental, and healthcare factors.
This study evaluates three machine learning models -- Linear Regression (LR),
Regression Decision Tree (RDT), and Random Forest (RF), using a real-world
dataset drawn from World Health Organization (WHO) and United Nations (UN)
sources. After extensive preprocessing to address missing values and
inconsistencies, each model's performance was assessed with $R^2$, Mean
Absolute Error (MAE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE). Results show that RF
achieves the highest predictive accuracy ($R^2 = 0.9423$), significantly
outperforming LR and RDT. Interpretability was prioritized through p-values for
LR and feature importance metrics for the tree-based models, revealing
immunization rates (diphtheria, measles) and demographic attributes (HIV/AIDS,
adult mortality) as critical drivers of life-expectancy predictions. These
insights underscore the synergy between ensemble methods and transparency in
addressing public-health challenges. Future research should explore advanced
imputation strategies, alternative algorithms (e.g., neural networks), and
updated data to further refine predictive accuracy and support evidence-based
policymaking in global health contexts.

Motivation: 理解LLM在强化学习训练中的参数动态变化机制，目前这方面研究还很缺乏。

Method: 通过分析8个LLM和7种算法，识别RL训练中的参数更新特性，并基于这些发现开发AlphaRL加速框架。

Result: 验证了秩1主导和秩1线性动态的普遍性，AlphaRL框架实现了2.5倍训练加速，同时保持96%以上的推理性能。

Conclusion: 这些发现为大规模RL训练提供了原则性、可解释且高效的新范式。

Abstract: Recent advances in reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) are
largely driven by reinforcement learning (RL), yet the underlying parameter
dynamics during RL training remain poorly understood. This work identifies two
fundamental properties of RL-induced parameter updates in LLMs: (1) Rank-1
Dominance, where the top singular subspace of the parameter update matrix
nearly fully determines reasoning improvements, recovering over 99\% of
performance gains; and (2) Rank-1 Linear Dynamics, where this dominant subspace
evolves linearly throughout training, enabling accurate prediction from early
checkpoints. Extensive experiments across 8 LLMs and 7 algorithms validate the
generalizability of these properties. More importantly, based on these
findings, we propose AlphaRL, a plug-in acceleration framework that
extrapolates the final parameter update using a short early training window,
achieving up to 2.5 speedup while retaining \textgreater 96\% of reasoning
performance without extra modules or hyperparameter tuning. This positions our
finding as a versatile and practical tool for large-scale RL, opening a path
toward principled, interpretable, and efficient training paradigm for LLMs.

Motivation: 现有研究未能充分解释SSMs高性能背后的机制，缺乏对SSMs学习动态的理论理解。

Method: 通过分析输入时间序列在状态中的存储方式来评估SSMs的记忆容量，建立S4模型的理论等价性，并通过实验验证初始参数的重要性。

Result: 研究发现成功学习需要尽可能长的初始记忆结构，即使会牺牲记忆精度；固定循环权重可获得相当或更好的性能，且收敛更快。

Conclusion: 该研究为SSMs提供了新的理论基础，并可能提供一种新颖的优化策略。

Abstract: State space models (SSMs) have gained attention by showing potential to
outperform Transformers. However, previous studies have not sufficiently
addressed the mechanisms underlying their high performance owing to a lack of
theoretical explanation of SSMs' learning dynamics. In this study, we provide
such an explanation and propose an improved training strategy. The memory
capacity of SSMs can be evaluated by examining how input time series are stored
in their current state. Such an examination reveals a tradeoff between memory
accuracy and length, as well as the theoretical equivalence between the
structured state space sequence model (S4) and a simplified S4 with diagonal
recurrent weights. This theoretical foundation allows us to elucidate the
learning dynamics, proving the importance of initial parameters. Our analytical
results suggest that successful learning requires the initial memory structure
to be the longest possible even if memory accuracy may deteriorate or the
gradient lose the teacher information. Experiments on tasks requiring long
memory confirmed that extending memory is difficult, emphasizing the importance
of initialization. Furthermore, we found that fixing recurrent weights can be
more advantageous than adapting them because it achieves comparable or even
higher performance with faster convergence. Our results provide a new
theoretical foundation for SSMs and potentially offer a novel optimization
strategy.

Conclusion: PANORAMA有效解决了ANNS系统的验证瓶颈问题，通过机器学习驱动的正交变换实现了显著的性能提升。

Abstract: Approximate Nearest-Neighbor Search (ANNS) efficiently finds data items whose
embeddings are close to that of a given query in a high-dimensional space,
aiming to balance accuracy with speed. Used in recommendation systems, image
and video retrieval, natural language processing, and retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG), ANNS algorithms such as IVFPQ, HNSW graphs, Annoy, and MRPT
utilize graph, tree, clustering, and quantization techniques to navigate large
vector spaces. Despite this progress, ANNS systems spend up to 99\% of query
time to compute distances in their final refinement phase. In this paper, we
present PANORAMA, a machine learning-driven approach that tackles the ANNS
verification bottleneck through data-adaptive learned orthogonal transforms
that facilitate the accretive refinement of distance bounds. Such transforms
compact over 90\% of signal energy into the first half of dimensions, enabling
early candidate pruning with partial distance computations. We integrate
PANORAMA into state-of-the-art ANNS methods, namely IVFPQ/Flat, HNSW, MRPT, and
Annoy, without index modification, using level-major memory layouts,
SIMD-vectorized partial distance computations, and cache-aware access patterns.
Experiments across diverse datasets -- from image-based CIFAR-10 and GIST to
modern embedding spaces including OpenAI's Ada 2 and Large 3 -- demonstrate
that PANORAMA affords a 2--30$\times$ end-to-end speedup with no recall loss.

Motivation: 先前工作只能针对非自适应对手达到O_d(log T)错误界限，而对自适应对手只能达到Õ_d(√T)界限。本文旨在缩小这一差距，证明针对自适应对手也能达到最优的O_d(log T)错误界限。

Method: 提出新的私有在线学习算法，针对具有有限Littlestone维度d的概念类，在可实现设置下对抗自适应对手，在不可知设置下处理更一般的数据分布。

Result: 在可实现设置下，新算法针对自适应对手达到O_d(log T)错误界限；在不可知设置下，对一般Littlestone类达到Õ_d(√T)次线性遗憾。

Conclusion: 证明了有限Littlestone维度的概念类在可实现和不可知设置下都能进行私有在线学习，填补了先前工作在对自适应对手性能上的差距。

Abstract: We revisit the problem of private online learning, in which a learner
receives a sequence of $T$ data points and has to respond at each time-step a
hypothesis. It is required that the entire stream of output hypotheses should
satisfy differential privacy. Prior work of Golowich and Livni [2021]
established that every concept class $\mathcal{H}$ with finite Littlestone
dimension $d$ is privately online learnable in the realizable setting. In
particular, they proposed an algorithm that achieves an $O_{d}(\log T)$ mistake
bound against an oblivious adversary. However, their approach yields a
suboptimal $\tilde{O}_{d}(\sqrt{T})$ bound against an adaptive adversary. In
this work, we present a new algorithm with a mistake bound of $O_{d}(\log T)$
against an adaptive adversary, closing this gap. We further investigate the
problem in the agnostic setting, which is more general than the realizable
setting as it does not impose any assumptions on the data. We give an algorithm
that obtains a sublinear regret of $\tilde{O}_d(\sqrt{T})$ for generic
Littlestone classes, demonstrating that they are also privately online
learnable in the agnostic setting.

TL;DR: 提出了Eyes-on-Me攻击方法，将对抗文档分解为可重用的注意力吸引器和焦点区域，显著提高了RAG系统数据投毒攻击的成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG系统数据投毒攻击扩展性差，需要为每个目标短语优化投毒文档，成本高昂。

Method: 将对抗文档分解为注意力吸引器和焦点区域模块，通过优化吸引器引导注意力到焦点区域，在其中插入检索器语义诱饵或生成器恶意指令。

Result: 在18个端到端RAG设置中，攻击成功率从21.9%提升到57.8%（提高35.9个百分点，是先前工作的2.6倍）。单个优化的吸引器无需重新训练即可迁移到未见过的黑盒检索器和生成器。

Conclusion: 建立了RAG数据投毒的可扩展范式，揭示了模块化、可重用组件对现代AI系统的实际威胁，同时发现了注意力集中与模型输出之间的强关联，为可解释性研究提供了信息。

Abstract: Existing data poisoning attacks on retrieval-augmented generation (RAG)
systems scale poorly because they require costly optimization of poisoned
documents for each target phrase. We introduce Eyes-on-Me, a modular attack
that decomposes an adversarial document into reusable Attention Attractors and
Focus Regions. Attractors are optimized to direct attention to the Focus
Region. Attackers can then insert semantic baits for the retriever or malicious
instructions for the generator, adapting to new targets at near zero cost. This
is achieved by steering a small subset of attention heads that we empirically
identify as strongly correlated with attack success. Across 18 end-to-end RAG
settings (3 datasets $\times$ 2 retrievers $\times$ 3 generators), Eyes-on-Me
raises average attack success rates from 21.9 to 57.8 (+35.9 points,
2.6$\times$ over prior work). A single optimized attractor transfers to unseen
black box retrievers and generators without retraining. Our findings establish
a scalable paradigm for RAG data poisoning and show that modular, reusable
components pose a practical threat to modern AI systems. They also reveal a
strong link between attention concentration and model outputs, informing
interpretability research.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的校准误差度量ETCE来评估降水临近预报的概率校准质量，并扩展了计算机视觉中的后处理技术来改进神经天气模型的校准效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经天气模型(NWMs)会产生校准不良的概率预报，而标准校准指标如ECE无法有效捕捉降水阈值间的校准误差，这对天气敏感决策至关重要。

Method: 引入了预期阈值校准误差(ETCE)新指标，并将计算机视觉中的后处理技术扩展到预报领域，采用选择性缩放和超前时间条件化方法。

Result: 选择性缩放结合超前时间条件化能够在不降低预报质量的情况下显著减少模型校准误差。

Conclusion: ETCE指标能更好地捕捉有序类别(如降水量)的校准误差，所提出的后处理方法有效改善了神经天气模型的概率预报校准性能。

Abstract: Reliable precipitation nowcasting is critical for weather-sensitive
decision-making, yet neural weather models (NWMs) can produce poorly calibrated
probabilistic forecasts. Standard calibration metrics such as the expected
calibration error (ECE) fail to capture miscalibration across precipitation
thresholds. We introduce the expected thresholded calibration error (ETCE), a
new metric that better captures miscalibration in ordered classes like
precipitation amounts. We extend post-processing techniques from computer
vision to the forecasting domain. Our results show that selective scaling with
lead time conditioning reduces model miscalibration without reducing the
forecast quality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法仅利用因果图信息设计模糊集，忽略了结构方程信息。为了平衡保守性和准确性，需要包含更现实的概率分布。

Method: 提出结构因果最优传输及其模糊集，引入正则化版本用正则项替代复杂因果约束，通过凸差规划实现高效算法。

Result: 方法能有效处理结构信息缺失情况，提供有限样本保证，克服最优传输的维度灾难，实现维度无关的更快收缩。

Conclusion: 整合结构方程信息能显著增强模糊集的现实性，提出的结构因果最优传输方法在理论和实践上都具有优势。

Abstract: Distributionally robust optimization tackles out-of-sample issues like
overfitting and distribution shifts by adopting an adversarial approach over a
range of possible data distributions, known as the ambiguity set. To balance
conservatism and accuracy, these sets must include realistic probability
distributions by leveraging information from the nominal distribution. Assuming
that nominal distributions arise from a structural causal model with a directed
acyclic graph $\mathcal{G}$ and structural equations, previous methods such as
adapted and $\mathcal{G}$-causal optimal transport have only utilized causal
graph information in designing ambiguity sets. In this work, we propose
incorporating structural equations, which include causal graph information, to
enhance ambiguity sets, resulting in more realistic distributions. We introduce
structural causal optimal transport and its associated ambiguity set,
demonstrating their advantages and connections to previous methods. A key
benefit of our approach is a relaxed version, where a regularization term
replaces the complex causal constraints, enabling an efficient algorithm via
difference-of-convex programming to solve structural causal optimal transport.
We also show that when structural information is absent and must be estimated,
our approach remains effective and provides finite sample guarantees. Lastly,
we address the radius of ambiguity sets, illustrating how our method overcomes
the curse of dimensionality in optimal transport problems, achieving faster
shrinkage with dimension-free order.

TL;DR: 提出了MA-SCLUCB算法，在多智能体网络环境中解决带阶段保守约束的随机线性赌博机问题，在保证安全性的同时实现协作学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实应用中多个学习智能体需要在探索与利用之间平衡，同时保证安全约束以避免灾难性失败。需要研究多智能体网络环境下的安全协作学习问题。

Method: 提出MA-SCLUCB算法，采用交替的动作选择和共识构建阶段。智能体仅与直接邻居通信，网络优化全局参数（局部参数的平均值）。

Result: 算法实现了$\tilde{O}\left(\frac{d}{\sqrt{N}}\sqrt{T}\cdot\frac{\log(NT)}{\sqrt{\log(1/|\lambda_2|)}}\right)$的遗憾界，其中协作带来$\frac{1}{\sqrt{N}}$的改进，通信开销仅对数增长，阶段安全约束仅增加低阶遗憾。

Conclusion: 在合理连接的网络中，带安全保证的分布式学习可以实现接近最优的性能，协作学习在局部通信下仍能显著提升性能。

Abstract: In many real-world applications such as recommendation systems, multiple
learning agents must balance exploration and exploitation while maintaining
safety guarantees to avoid catastrophic failures. We study the stochastic
linear bandit problem in a multi-agent networked setting where agents must
satisfy stage-wise conservative constraints. A network of $N$ agents
collaboratively maximizes cumulative reward while ensuring that the expected
reward at every round is no less than $(1-\alpha)$ times that of a baseline
policy. Each agent observes local rewards with unknown parameters, but the
network optimizes for the global parameter (average of local parameters).
Agents communicate only with immediate neighbors, and each communication round
incurs additional regret. We propose MA-SCLUCB (Multi-Agent Stage-wise
Conservative Linear UCB), an episodic algorithm alternating between action
selection and consensus-building phases. We prove that MA-SCLUCB achieves
regret
$\tilde{O}\left(\frac{d}{\sqrt{N}}\sqrt{T}\cdot\frac{\log(NT)}{\sqrt{\log(1/|\lambda_2|)}}\right)$
with high probability, where $d$ is the dimension, $T$ is the horizon, and
$|\lambda_2|$ is the network's second largest eigenvalue magnitude. Our
analysis shows: (i) collaboration yields $\frac{1}{\sqrt{N}}$ improvement
despite local communication, (ii) communication overhead grows only
logarithmically for well-connected networks, and (iii) stage-wise safety adds
only lower-order regret. Thus, distributed learning with safety guarantees
achieves near-optimal performance in reasonably connected networks.

TL;DR: 提出FAME框架，通过神经控制微分方程和混合专家模型实现函数间回归，在合成和真实数据集上达到最先进性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 函数数据的无限维特性使表示学习困难，传统方法依赖预设基展开或核函数限制灵活性，深度学习常忽略函数连续性

Method: 结合双向神经控制微分方程和混合专家模型构建连续注意力机制，使用多头交叉注意力捕捉函数间依赖关系

Result: 在函数回归基准测试中达到最先进准确率，对任意采样离散观测具有强鲁棒性

Conclusion: FAME提供端到端数据驱动的函数间回归框架，有效处理函数数据的连续性和无限维特性

Abstract: Functional data play a pivotal role across science and engineering, yet their
infinite-dimensional nature makes representation learning challenging.
Conventional statistical models depend on pre-chosen basis expansions or
kernels, limiting the flexibility of data-driven discovery, while many
deep-learning pipelines treat functions as fixed-grid vectors, ignoring
inherent continuity. In this paper, we introduce Functional Attention with a
Mixture-of-Experts (FAME), an end-to-end, fully data-driven framework for
function-on-function regression. FAME forms continuous attention by coupling a
bidirectional neural controlled differential equation with MoE-driven vector
fields to capture intra-functional continuity, and further fuses change to
inter-functional dependencies via multi-head cross attention. Extensive
experiments on synthetic and real-world functional-regression benchmarks show
that FAME achieves state-of-the-art accuracy, strong robustness to arbitrarily
sampled discrete observations of functions.

TL;DR: EF21-Muon是首个具有严格收敛保证的通信高效、非欧几里得LMO优化器，支持随机梯度、动量和双向压缩，在NanoGPT实验中实现了7倍的通信节省且无精度损失。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有优化器如Muon、Scion、Gluon虽然通过利用层间线性最小化预言机在非欧几里得范数球上推进了大规模深度学习，但缺乏原则性的分布式框架，通信瓶颈未解决，且现有分布式变体都是启发式的，没有收敛保证。

Method: 提出EF21-Muon，首个具有严格收敛保证的通信高效非欧几里得LMO优化器，支持随机梯度、动量和带误差反馈的双向压缩，是误差反馈在非欧几里得设置下的首次扩展。

Result: EF21-Muon在压缩关闭和特定范数选择时恢复Muon/Scion/Gluon，提供了该强大优化器家族的首个高效分布式实现。理论覆盖非欧几里得光滑和更一般的(L^0,L^1)-光滑设置，匹配已知最佳欧几里得速率。

Conclusion: EF21-Muon在NanoGPT基准测试中相比未压缩的Muon/Scion/Gluon实现了高达7倍的通信节省且无精度下降，理论分析扩展到层间广义光滑度机制，捕捉了深度网络的各向异性结构。

Abstract: Recent optimizers like Muon, Scion, and Gluon have pushed the frontier of
large-scale deep learning by exploiting layer-wise linear minimization oracles
(LMOs) over non-Euclidean norm balls, capturing neural network structure in
ways traditional algorithms cannot. Yet, no principled distributed framework
exists for these methods, and communication bottlenecks remain unaddressed. The
very few distributed variants are heuristic, with no convergence guarantees in
sight. We introduce EF21-Muon, the first communication-efficient, non-Euclidean
LMO-based optimizer with rigorous convergence guarantees. EF21-Muon supports
stochastic gradients, momentum, and bidirectional compression with error
feedback-marking the first extension of error feedback beyond the Euclidean
setting. It recovers Muon/Scion/Gluon when compression is off and specific
norms are chosen, providing the first efficient distributed implementation of
this powerful family. Our theory covers non-Euclidean smooth and the more
general $(L^0, L^1)$-smooth setting, matching best-known Euclidean rates and
enabling faster convergence under suitable norm choices. We further extend the
analysis to layer-wise (generalized) smoothness regimes, capturing the
anisotropic structure of deep networks. Experiments on NanoGPT benchmarking
EF21-Muon against uncompressed Muon/Scion/Gluon demonstrate up to $7\times$
communication savings with no accuracy degradation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法在分析隧道开挖引起的土-桩相互作用时存在计算复杂、耗时长的缺点，需要开发一种既能利用物理规律又能结合实测数据的高效方法。

Method: 将桩基建模为欧拉-伯努利梁，周围土体建模为Pasternak地基，构建四阶常微分方程作为物理信息组件，结合实测数据形成极限学习机网络的损失向量，使用最小二乘法在1秒内完成训练。

Result: 验证表明PIELM方法准确可靠，参数研究表明监测数据应布置在桩顶/桩尖和隧道开挖区域附近等桩身变形梯度显著的位置。

Conclusion: 该方法在桩基实时监测和安全评估方面具有巨大潜力，有助于岩土工程智能预警系统的建设。

Abstract: Physics-informed machine learning has been a promising data-driven and
physics-informed approach in geotechnical engineering. This study proposes a
physics-informed extreme learning machine (PIELM) framework for analyzing
tunneling-induced soil-pile interactions. The pile foundation is modeled as an
Euler-Bernoulli beam, and the surrounding soil is modeled as a Pasternak
foundation. The soil-pile interaction is formulated into a fourth-order
ordinary differential equation (ODE) that constitutes the physics-informed
component, while measured data are incorporated into PIELM as the data-driven
component. Combining physics and data yields a loss vector of the extreme
learning machine (ELM) network, which is trained within 1 second by the least
squares method. After validating the PIELM approach by the boundary element
method (BEM) and finite difference method (FDM), parametric studies are carried
out to examine the effects of ELM network architecture, data monitoring
locations and numbers on the performance of PIELM. The results indicate that
monitored data should be placed at positions where the gradients of pile
deflections are significant, such as at the pile tip/top and near tunneling
zones. Two application examples highlight the critical role of physics-informed
and data-driven approach for tunnelling-induced soil-pile interactions. The
proposed approach shows great potential for real-time monitoring and safety
assessment of pile foundations, and benefits for intelligent early-warning
systems in geotechnical engineering.

TL;DR: 本文研究了多种机器学习算法在数字发展干预文档分类中的性能，采用One vs Rest方法构建组合模型来处理多类别分类问题，并发现数据量不是影响性能的唯一因素，类内相似性和类间差异性也很关键。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于数字数据库的快速增长，自动化文档分类成为NLP领域的热门话题。但针对特定分类任务训练良好的模型可能在其他数据集上表现不佳，因此需要训练和评估多个模型来优化结果。数字发展干预领域相对较新，利用NLP技术具有广阔的应用前景。

Method: 使用公开可用的全球数字发展干预文档数据库，包含12个类别。评估了决策树、k近邻、支持向量机、AdaBoost、随机梯度下降、朴素贝叶斯和逻辑回归等机器学习算法。采用过采样处理类别不平衡问题，并使用One vs Rest方法构建组合模型进行多类别分类。

Result: 使用准确率、精确率、召回率和F1分数评估模型性能。研究发现数据量不是影响分类性能的唯一因素，类内相似性和类间差异性对模型性能也有重要影响。

Conclusion: 研究得出结论，在文档分类任务中，除了数据量外，类内相似性和类间差异性也是影响模型性能的关键因素。One vs Rest方法在多类别分类中能够优化性能表现。

Abstract: Automated document classification is a trending topic in Natural Language
Processing (NLP) due to the extensive growth in digital databases. However, a
model that fits well for a specific classification task might perform weakly
for another dataset due to differences in the context. Thus, training and
evaluating several models is necessary to optimise the results. This study
employs a publicly available document database on worldwide digital development
interventions categorised under twelve areas. Since digital interventions are
still emerging, utilising NLP in the field is relatively new. Given the
exponential growth of digital interventions, this research has a vast scope for
improving how digital-development-oriented organisations report their work. The
paper examines the classification performance of Machine Learning (ML)
algorithms, including Decision Trees, k-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector
Machine, AdaBoost, Stochastic Gradient Descent, Naive Bayes, and Logistic
Regression. Accuracy, precision, recall and F1-score are utilised to evaluate
the performance of these models, while oversampling is used to address the
class-imbalanced nature of the dataset. Deviating from the traditional approach
of fitting a single model for multiclass classification, this paper
investigates the One vs Rest approach to build a combined model that optimises
the performance. The study concludes that the amount of data is not the sole
factor affecting the performance; features like similarity within classes and
dissimilarity among classes are also crucial.

Motivation: 结合深度学习与随机过程理论，构建一个既具有预测准确性又保持物理解释性的生存分析模型，不依赖比例风险假设。

Conclusion: 随机过程理论与深度学习的结合为复杂系统中的生存现象建模提供了原则性途径，实现了预测性能与模型可解释性的平衡。

Abstract: We introduce DeepFHT, a survival-analysis framework that couples deep neural
networks with first hitting time (FHT) distributions from stochastic process
theory. Time to event is represented as the first passage of a latent diffusion
process to an absorbing boundary. A neural network maps input variables to
physically meaningful parameters including initial condition, drift, and
diffusion, within a chosen FHT process such as Brownian motion, both with drift
and driftless. This yields closed-form survival and hazard functions and
captures time-varying risk without assuming proportional-hazards.
  We compare DeepFHT with Cox regression and other existing parametric survival
models, using synthetic and real-world datasets. The method achieves predictive
accuracy on par with state-of-the-art approaches, while maintaining a
physics-based interpretable parameterization that elucidates the relation
between input features and risk. This combination of stochastic process theory
and deep learning provides a principled avenue for modeling survival phenomena
in complex systems.

TL;DR: TD-JEPA是一种基于时序差分学习的潜在预测方法，用于无监督强化学习，能够在潜在空间中训练状态和任务编码器、策略条件多步预测器以及参数化策略，实现测试时对任意奖励函数的零样本优化。

Conclusion: TD-JEPA通过时序差分学习实现了跨多个策略的长期潜在动态预测，为无监督强化学习提供了一种有效的表示学习方法，支持测试时的零样本奖励优化。

Abstract: Latent prediction--where agents learn by predicting their own latents--has
emerged as a powerful paradigm for training general representations in machine
learning. In reinforcement learning (RL), this approach has been explored to
define auxiliary losses for a variety of settings, including reward-based and
unsupervised RL, behavior cloning, and world modeling. While existing methods
are typically limited to single-task learning, one-step prediction, or
on-policy trajectory data, we show that temporal difference (TD) learning
enables learning representations predictive of long-term latent dynamics across
multiple policies from offline, reward-free transitions. Building on this, we
introduce TD-JEPA, which leverages TD-based latent-predictive representations
into unsupervised RL. TD-JEPA trains explicit state and task encoders, a
policy-conditioned multi-step predictor, and a set of parameterized policies
directly in latent space. This enables zero-shot optimization of any reward
function at test time. Theoretically, we show that an idealized variant of
TD-JEPA avoids collapse with proper initialization, and learns encoders that
capture a low-rank factorization of long-term policy dynamics, while the
predictor recovers their successor features in latent space. Empirically,
TD-JEPA matches or outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on locomotion,
navigation, and manipulation tasks across 13 datasets in ExoRL and OGBench,
especially in the challenging setting of zero-shot RL from pixels.

Method: 使用预测作为下游任务，评估时间序列基础模型的零样本能力和微调性能，并与专门的小模型比较。

Result: 时间序列基础模型的零样本能力受预训练域影响，在未见数据上微调后性能提升有限，相比参数更少的小模型优势不明显。

Conclusion: 时间序列数据的多样性使得构建有效基础模型面临挑战，专门的小模型在预测任务中可能更实用。

Abstract: Foundation Models are designed to serve as versatile embedding machines, with
strong zero shot capabilities and superior generalization performance when
fine-tuned on diverse downstream tasks. While this is largely true for language
and vision foundation models, we argue that the inherent diversity of time
series data makes them less suited for building effective foundation models. We
demonstrate this using forecasting as our downstream task. We show that the
zero-shot capabilities of a time series foundation model are significantly
influenced and tied to the specific domains it has been pretrained on.
Furthermore, when applied to unseen real-world time series data, fine-tuned
foundation models do not consistently yield substantially better results,
relative to their increased parameter count and memory footprint, than smaller,
dedicated models tailored to the specific forecasting task at hand.

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) largely rely on the message-passing paradigm,
where nodes iteratively aggregate information from their neighbors. Yet,
standard message passing neural networks (MPNNs) face well-documented
theoretical and practical limitations. Graph positional encoding (PE) has
emerged as a promising direction to address these limitations. The Euler
Characteristic Transform (ECT) is an efficiently computable
geometric-topological invariant that characterizes shapes and graphs. In this
work, we combine the differentiable approximation of the ECT (DECT) and its
local variant ($\ell$-ECT) to propose LEAP, a new end-to-end trainable local
structural PE for graphs. We evaluate our approach on multiple real-world
datasets as well as on a synthetic task designed to test its ability to extract
topological features. Our results underline the potential of LEAP-based
encodings as a powerful component for graph representation learning pipelines.

Conclusion: 优化器的选择是影响LLM遗忘鲁棒性的关键因素，使用低阶优化器或混合优化器可以有效增强遗忘效果的稳定性。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) unlearning aims to surgically remove the influence
of undesired data or knowledge from an existing model while preserving its
utility on unrelated tasks. This paradigm has shown promise in addressing
privacy and safety concerns. However, recent findings reveal that unlearning
effects are often fragile: post-unlearning manipulations such as weight
quantization or fine-tuning can quickly neutralize the intended forgetting.
Prior efforts to improve robustness primarily reformulate unlearning objectives
by explicitly assuming the role of vulnerability sources. In this work, we take
a different perspective by investigating the role of the optimizer, independent
of unlearning objectives and formulations, in shaping unlearning robustness. We
show that the 'grade' of the optimizer, defined by the level of information it
exploits, ranging from zeroth-order (gradient-free) to first-order
(gradient-based) to second-order (Hessian-based), is tightly linked to the
resilience of unlearning. Surprisingly, we find that downgrading the optimizer,
such as using zeroth-order methods or compressed-gradient variants (e.g.,
gradient sign-based optimizers), often leads to stronger robustness. While
these optimizers produce noisier and less precise updates, they encourage
convergence to harder-to-disturb basins in the loss landscape, thereby
resisting post-training perturbations. By connecting zeroth-order methods with
randomized smoothing, we further highlight their natural advantage for robust
unlearning. Motivated by these insights, we propose a hybrid optimizer that
combines first-order and zeroth-order updates, preserving unlearning efficacy
while enhancing robustness. Extensive experiments on the MUSE and WMDP
benchmarks, across multiple LLM unlearning algorithms, validate that our
approach achieves more resilient forgetting without sacrificing unlearning
quality.

Motivation: 现有反馈范式依赖发布新消息，LLM难以可靠整合这些反馈，导致改进不一致。需要更有效的交互机制来指导LLM进行复杂推理。

Method: 引入原地反馈范式：用户直接编辑LLM的先前响应，模型基于这个修改后的响应生成修订版本，而不是依赖新的文本消息。

Result: 在多样化推理密集型基准测试中，原地反馈比传统多轮反馈表现更好，同时使用79.1%更少的token。在受控环境中证明原地反馈能解决多轮反馈的核心限制。

Conclusion: 原地反馈为推理密集型任务提供了更自然有效的LLM指导机制，能更精确地应用反馈到错误部分，避免引入新错误。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly studied in the context of
multi-turn reasoning, where models iteratively refine their outputs based on
user-provided feedback. Such settings are crucial for tasks that require
complex reasoning, yet existing feedback paradigms often rely on issuing new
messages. LLMs struggle to integrate these reliably, leading to inconsistent
improvements. In this work, we introduce in-place feedback, a novel interaction
paradigm in which users directly edit an LLM's previous response, and the model
conditions on this modified response to generate its revision. Empirical
evaluations on diverse reasoning-intensive benchmarks reveal that in-place
feedback achieves better performance than conventional multi-turn feedback
while using $79.1\%$ fewer tokens. Complementary analyses on controlled
environments further demonstrate that in-place feedback resolves a core
limitation of multi-turn feedback: models often fail to apply feedback
precisely to erroneous parts of the response, leaving errors uncorrected and
sometimes introducing new mistakes into previously correct content. These
findings suggest that in-place feedback offers a more natural and effective
mechanism for guiding LLMs in reasoning-intensive tasks.

TL;DR: 提出了一种在复杂系统中高效探索用户感兴趣区域内模式多样性的方法，通过系统无关的约束条件来引导探索过程，在保持全局多样性的同时最大化约束多样性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 复杂系统产生的模式多样性对科学和艺术应用很有价值，但参数空间庞大且参数与模式之间存在强非线性映射关系。用户通常对特定模式有预期，这给探索过程带来了新挑战。

Method: 提供设计选择和实现方案，通过用户以系统无关方式表达的显式约束条件，在用户感兴趣区域内以样本高效的方式最大化模式多样性。

Result: 实现了交互式系统探索，能够在保持全局多样性的同时获得约束多样性，有效解决了复杂系统探索中的挑战。

Conclusion: 该方法成功解决了复杂系统探索中的关键问题，通过约束条件引导探索过程，在用户感兴趣区域内高效发现多样模式，同时维持系统的整体多样性。

Abstract: The diversity of patterns that emerge from complex systems motivates their
use for scientific or artistic purposes. When exploring these systems, the
challenges faced are the size of the parameter space and the strongly
non-linear mapping between parameters and emerging patterns. In addition,
artists and scientists who explore complex systems do so with an expectation of
particular patterns. Taking these expectations into account adds a new set of
challenges, which the exploration process must address. We provide design
choices and their implementation to address these challenges; enabling the
maximization of the diversity of patterns discovered in the user's region of
interest -- which we call the constrained diversity -- in a sample-efficient
manner. The region of interest is expressed in the form of explicit
constraints. These constraints are formulated by the user in a system-agnostic
way, and their addition enables interactive system exploration leading to
constrained diversity, while maintaining global diversity.

Motivation: 解决化学空间高效探索的挑战，许多生成模型仍产生不稳定或不可合成的化合物。

Method: 扩展EvoMol进化算法，集成强化学习，利用扩展连接性指纹(ECFPs)学习基于局部结构背景的上下文感知突变策略。

Result: EvoMol-RL在分子预过滤真实性方面持续优于基线，减少了结构伪影频率并增强了优化性能。

Conclusion: 结合强化学习和分子指纹可有效生成化学相关的分子结构。

Abstract: The efficient exploration of chemical space remains a central challenge, as
many generative models still produce unstable or non-synthesizable compounds.
To address these limitations, we present EvoMol-RL, a significant extension of
the EvoMol evolutionary algorithm that integrates reinforcement learning to
guide molecular mutations based on local structural context. By leveraging
Extended Connectivity Fingerprints (ECFPs), EvoMol-RL learns context-aware
mutation policies that prioritize chemically plausible transformations. This
approach significantly improves the generation of valid and realistic
molecules, reducing the frequency of structural artifacts and enhancing
optimization performance. The results demonstrate that EvoMol-RL consistently
outperforms its baseline in molecular pre-filtering realism. These results
emphasize the effectiveness of combining reinforcement learning with molecular
fingerprints to generate chemically relevant molecular structures.

Motivation: 现有研究假设完全知道用户的固有意见，但实际社交平台干预中固有意见是未知的，需要通过顺序观察来学习，这更符合现实场景。

Method: 提出两阶段算法：首先进行子空间估计识别低维结构，然后在估计子空间导出的紧凑维度表示中使用线性老虎机算法。

Conclusion: 该工作建立了社交媒体平台算法干预与多臂老虎机理论的关键联系，为在线意见动态干预提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: We study the problem of minimizing polarization and disagreement in the
Friedkin-Johnsen opinion dynamics model under incomplete information. Unlike
prior work that assumes a static setting with full knowledge of users' innate
opinions, we address the more realistic online setting where innate opinions
are unknown and must be learned through sequential observations. This novel
setting, which naturally mirrors periodic interventions on social media
platforms, is formulated as a regret minimization problem, establishing a key
connection between algorithmic interventions on social media platforms and
theory of multi-armed bandits. In our formulation, a learner observes only a
scalar feedback of the overall polarization and disagreement after an
intervention. For this novel bandit problem, we propose a two-stage algorithm
based on low-rank matrix bandits. The algorithm first performs subspace
estimation to identify an underlying low-dimensional structure, and then
employs a linear bandit algorithm within the compact dimensional representation
derived from the estimated subspace. We prove that our algorithm achieves an $
\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{T}) $ cumulative regret over any time horizon $T$.
Empirical results validate that our algorithm significantly outperforms a
linear bandit baseline in terms of both cumulative regret and running time.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GFlowNets采样策略倾向于过度探索，在大型搜索空间中难以持续生成高奖励样本，特别是在稀疏高奖励区域。如何在保持多样性的前提下提高高奖励样本的生成概率是一个关键挑战。

Method: 集成增强的MCTS到GFlowNets采样过程，使用MCTS进行策略评估引导高奖励轨迹生成，采用PUCT自适应平衡探索与利用，并引入可控机制调节贪婪程度。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法不仅能加速发现高奖励区域，还能持续生成高奖励样本，同时保持生成分布的多样性。

Conclusion: 该方法通过动态平衡探索和奖励驱动引导，增强了利用能力而不牺牲多样性，有效解决了GFlowNets在大型稀疏搜索空间中的采样挑战。

Abstract: Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) have emerged as a powerful tool for
generating diverse and high-reward structured objects by learning to sample
from a distribution proportional to a given reward function. Unlike
conventional reinforcement learning (RL) approaches that prioritize
optimization of a single trajectory, GFlowNets seek to balance diversity and
reward by modeling the entire trajectory distribution. This capability makes
them especially suitable for domains such as molecular design and combinatorial
optimization. However, existing GFlowNets sampling strategies tend to
overexplore and struggle to consistently generate high-reward samples,
particularly in large search spaces with sparse high-reward regions. Therefore,
improving the probability of generating high-reward samples without sacrificing
diversity remains a key challenge under this premise. In this work, we
integrate an enhanced Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) into the GFlowNets
sampling process, using MCTS-based policy evaluation to guide the generation
toward high-reward trajectories and Polynomial Upper Confidence Trees (PUCT) to
balance exploration and exploitation adaptively, and we introduce a
controllable mechanism to regulate the degree of greediness. Our method
enhances exploitation without sacrificing diversity by dynamically balancing
exploration and reward-driven guidance. The experimental results show that our
method can not only accelerate the speed of discovering high-reward regions but
also continuously generate high-reward samples, while preserving the diversity
of the generative distribution. All implementations are available at

Motivation: 时间序列基础模型在零样本泛化方面表现出色，但其在连续适应过程中的鲁棒性尚未得到充分探索，特别是灾难性遗忘问题。

Method: 使用具有不同周期性结构的合成数据集，测量模型在新数据适应与先前知识保留之间的权衡。

Result: 实验表明，虽然微调能提高新任务的性能，但通常会导致先前学习任务的性能显著下降。

Conclusion: 时间序列基础模型在连续微调时面临稳定性与可塑性的基本困境，需要解决灾难性遗忘问题。

Abstract: Time Series Foundation Models (TSFMs) have shown promising zero-shot
generalization across diverse forecasting tasks. However, their robustness to
continual adaptation remains underexplored. In this work, we investigate the
extent to which TSFMs suffer from catastrophic forgetting when fine-tuned
sequentially on multiple datasets. Using synthetic datasets designed with
varying degrees of periodic structure, we measure the trade-off between
adaptation to new data and retention of prior knowledge. Our experiments reveal
that, while fine-tuning improves performance on new tasks, it often causes
significant degradation on previously learned ones, illustrating a fundamental
stability-plasticity dilemma.

TL;DR: 提出了一种动态学习引导权重的方法，替代传统CFG中的静态权重，通过最小化分布差异来改善条件扩散模型的采样质量和对齐度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统CFG使用固定的引导权重虽然能提升感知质量，但往往导致分布对齐变差。需要一种能更好逼近目标条件分布的方法。

Method: 学习连续函数形式的引导权重ω_{c,(s,t)}，它是条件c、去噪起始时间t和目标时间s的函数。通过最小化真实条件分布与引导扩散过程样本间的分布差异来实现。

Result: 在低维玩具示例和高维图像设置中均有效，改善了FID指标。在文本到图像应用中，使用CLIP分数作为奖励函数能提升图像-提示对齐度。

Conclusion: 动态学习的引导权重比静态权重能更好地平衡感知质量和分布对齐，特别是在结合奖励函数时能进一步提升条件生成的质量。

Abstract: Classifier-free guidance (CFG) is a widely used technique for improving the
perceptual quality of samples from conditional diffusion models. It operates by
linearly combining conditional and unconditional score estimates using a
guidance weight $\omega$. While a large, static weight can markedly improve
visual results, this often comes at the cost of poorer distributional
alignment. In order to better approximate the target conditional distribution,
we instead learn guidance weights $\omega_{c,(s,t)}$, which are continuous
functions of the conditioning $c$, the time $t$ from which we denoise, and the
time $s$ towards which we denoise. We achieve this by minimizing the
distributional mismatch between noised samples from the true conditional
distribution and samples from the guided diffusion process. We extend our
framework to reward guided sampling, enabling the model to target distributions
tilted by a reward function $R(x_0,c)$, defined on clean data and a
conditioning $c$. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our methodology on
low-dimensional toy examples and high-dimensional image settings, where we
observe improvements in Fr\'echet inception distance (FID) for image
generation. In text-to-image applications, we observe that employing a reward
function given by the CLIP score leads to guidance weights that improve
image-prompt alignment.

Motivation: 现有策略梯度方法在大型语言模型推理中的优化稳定性研究不足，导致需要保守的超参数选择，增加了训练样本需求和计算成本。

Method: 形式化策略梯度的随机优化问题，考虑二阶几何信息，提出可计算框架跟踪曲率信息，并通过数据选择设计优化干预，识别并屏蔽导致不稳定更新的样本。

Result: 在标准数学推理基准测试中，CAPO在激进学习机制下确保稳定更新，仅拒绝不到8%的token就能实现比标准GRPO高达30倍的样本效率提升。

Conclusion: 曲率感知策略优化能够可靠地跟踪优化动态并利用于训练，实现更高效的样本利用和可扩展的后训练。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning, particularly through policy gradient methods, has
played a central role in enabling reasoning capabilities of Large Language
Models. However, the optimization stability of policy gradients in this setting
remains understudied. As a result, existing implementations often resort to
conservative hyperparameter choices to ensure stability, which requires more
training samples and increases computational costs. Hence, developing models
for reliably tracking the underlying optimization dynamics and leveraging them
into training enables more sample-efficient regimes and further unleashes
scalable post-training. We address this gap by formalizing the stochastic
optimization problem of policy gradients with explicit consideration of
second-order geometry. We propose a tractable computational framework that
tracks and leverages curvature information during policy updates. We further
employ this framework to design interventions in the optimization process
through data selection. The resultant algorithm, Curvature-Aware Policy
Optimization (CAPO), identifies samples that contribute to unstable updates and
masks them out. Theoretically, we establish monotonic improvement guarantees
under realistic assumptions. On standard math reasoning benchmarks, we
empirically show that CAPO ensures stable updates under aggressive learning
regimes where baselines catastrophically fail. With minimal intervention
(rejecting fewer than 8% of tokens), CAPO achieves up to 30x improvement in
sample efficiency over standard GRPO for LLM reasoning.

Motivation: 解决LLM路由问题，即在平衡用户满意度、模型专业知识和推理成本的前提下，为每个查询选择最佳模型。

Method: 将路由问题建模为上下文对决赌博机，提出CCFT方法通过对比微调和类别加权学习模型嵌入，并应用FGTS.CDB算法进行路由决策。

Result: 在RouterBench和MixInstruct数据集上的实验表明，该方法实现了更低的累积遗憾和更快的收敛速度，相比基于通用OpenAI嵌入模型的基线方法具有更好的鲁棒性和性能-成本平衡。

Conclusion: 提出的CCFT方法和FGTS.CDB算法能够有效解决LLM路由问题，在多个基准测试中展现出优越的性能。

Abstract: We study LLM routing, the problem of selecting the best model for each query
while balancing user satisfaction, model expertise, and inference cost. We
formulate routing as contextual dueling bandits, learning from pairwise
preference feedback rather than absolute scores, thereby yielding
label-efficient and dynamic adaptation. Building on this formulation, we
introduce Category-Calibrated Fine-Tuning (CCFT), a representation-learning
method that derives model embeddings from offline data using contrastive
fine-tuning with categorical weighting. These embeddings enable the practical
instantiation of Feel-Good Thompson Sampling for Contextual Dueling Bandits
(FGTS.CDB), a theoretically grounded posterior-sampling algorithm. We propose
four variants of the categorical weighting that explicitly integrate model
quality and cost, and we empirically evaluate the proposed methods on the
RouterBench and MixInstruct datasets. Across both benchmarks, our methods
achieve lower cumulative regret and faster convergence, with better robustness
and performance-cost balance than strong baselines built with a general-purpose
OpenAI embedding model.

Result: 在多种模型和任务上的结果表明，EAP-IG表现出高结构方差和对超参数的敏感性，这质疑了其发现的稳定性。

Conclusion: 提出了报告稳定性指标的最佳实践建议，以促进更严谨和基于统计的可解释性科学。

Abstract: The development of trustworthy artificial intelligence requires moving beyond
black-box performance metrics toward an understanding of models' internal
computations. Mechanistic Interpretability (MI) aims to meet this need by
identifying the algorithmic mechanisms underlying model behaviors. Yet, the
scientific rigor of MI critically depends on the reliability of its findings.
In this work, we argue that interpretability methods, such as circuit
discovery, should be viewed as statistical estimators, subject to questions of
variance and robustness. To illustrate this statistical framing, we present a
systematic stability analysis of a state-of-the-art circuit discovery method:
EAP-IG. We evaluate its variance and robustness through a comprehensive suite
of controlled perturbations, including input resampling, prompt paraphrasing,
hyperparameter variation, and injected noise within the causal analysis itself.
Across a diverse set of models and tasks, our results demonstrate that EAP-IG
exhibits high structural variance and sensitivity to hyperparameters,
questioning the stability of its findings. Based on these results, we offer a
set of best-practice recommendations for the field, advocating for the routine
reporting of stability metrics to promote a more rigorous and statistically
grounded science of interpretability.

Abstract: This paper presents a population synthesis model that utilizes the
Wasserstein Generative-Adversarial Network (WGAN) for training on incomplete
microsamples. By using a mask matrix to represent missing values, the study
proposes a WGAN training algorithm that lets the model learn from a training
dataset that has some missing information. The proposed method aims to address
the challenge of missing information in microsamples on one or more attributes
due to privacy concerns or data collection constraints. The paper contrasts
WGAN models trained on incomplete microsamples with those trained on complete
microsamples, creating a synthetic population. We conducted a series of
evaluations of the proposed method using a Swedish national travel survey. We
validate the efficacy of the proposed method by generating synthetic
populations from all the models and comparing them to the actual population
dataset. The results from the experiments showed that the proposed methodology
successfully generates synthetic data that closely resembles a model trained
with complete data as well as the actual population. The paper contributes to
the field by providing a robust solution for population synthesis with
incomplete data, opening avenues for future research, and highlighting the
potential of deep generative models in advancing population synthesis
capabilities.

Motivation: 大规模模型在包含混合质量文档的网络爬取数据集上预训练，数据过滤变得至关重要。CQF是一种流行的方法，但需要深入理解其工作原理和局限性。

Method: 分析CQF方法，比较CQF训练模型与在通过随机标记排列获得的合成数据上训练模型的行为差异。

Result: CQF虽然能提高下游任务性能，但不会增强高质量数据集上的语言建模能力。与合成数据训练模型相比，CQF表现出截然不同的趋势。

Conclusion: 研究结果挑战了CQF能捕捉有意义数据质量概念的观点，揭示了CQF方法的局限性。

Abstract: Large-scale models are pretrained on massive web-crawled datasets containing
documents of mixed quality, making data filtering essential. A popular method
is Classifier-based Quality Filtering (CQF), which trains a binary classifier
to distinguish between pretraining data and a small, high-quality set. It
assigns each pretraining document a quality score defined as the classifier's
score and retains only the top-scoring ones. We provide an in-depth analysis of
CQF. We show that while CQF improves downstream task performance, it does not
necessarily enhance language modeling on the high-quality dataset. We explain
this paradox by the fact that CQF implicitly filters the high-quality dataset
as well. We further compare the behavior of models trained with CQF to those
trained on synthetic data of increasing quality, obtained via random token
permutations, and find starkly different trends. Our results challenge the view
that CQF captures a meaningful notion of data quality.

Conclusion: CT-GAN是生成目标人口的有效方法，深度学习模型可以与传统合成技术成功集成以提升性能。

Abstract: Agent-based models used in scenario planning for transportation and urban
planning usually require detailed population information from the base as well
as target scenarios. These populations are usually provided by synthesizing
fake agents through deterministic population synthesis methods. However, these
deterministic population synthesis methods face several challenges, such as
handling high-dimensional data, scalability, and zero-cell issues, particularly
when generating populations for target scenarios. This research looks into how
a deep generative model called Conditional Tabular Generative Adversarial
Network (CT-GAN) can be used to create target populations either directly from
a collection of marginal constraints or through a hybrid method that combines
CT-GAN with Fitness-based Synthesis Combinatorial Optimization (FBS-CO). The
research evaluates the proposed population synthesis models against travel
survey and zonal-level aggregated population data. Results indicate that the
stand-alone CT-GAN model performs the best when compared with FBS-CO and the
hybrid model. CT-GAN by itself can create realistic-looking groups that match
single-variable distributions, but it struggles to maintain relationships
between multiple variables. However, the hybrid model demonstrates improved
performance compared to FBS-CO by leveraging CT-GAN ability to generate a
descriptive base population, which is then refined using FBS-CO to align with
target-year marginals. This study demonstrates that CT-GAN represents an
effective methodology for target populations and highlights how deep generative
models can be successfully integrated with conventional synthesis techniques to
enhance their performance.

Abstract: High-quality data is a prerequisite for training reliable Artificial
Intelligence (AI) models in the energy domain. In district heating networks,
sensor and metering data often suffer from noise, missing values, and temporal
inconsistencies, which can significantly degrade model performance. This paper
presents a systematic approach for evaluating and improving data quality using
visual diagnostics, implemented through an interactive web-based dashboard. The
dashboard employs Python-based visualization techniques, including time series
plots, heatmaps, box plots, histograms, correlation matrices, and
anomaly-sensitive KPIs such as skewness and anomaly detection based on the
modified z-scores. These tools al-low human experts to inspect and interpret
data anomalies, enabling a human-in-the-loop strategy for data quality
assessment. The methodology is demonstrated on a real-world dataset from a
Danish district heating provider, covering over four years of hourly data from
nearly 7000 meters. The findings show how visual analytics can uncover systemic
data issues and, in the future, guide data cleaning strategies that enhance the
accuracy, stability, and generalizability of Long Short-Term Memory and Gated
Recurrent Unit models for heat demand forecasting. The study contributes to a
scalable, generalizable framework for visual data inspection and underlines the
critical role of data quality in AI-driven energy management systems.

designed as an alternative to conventional MLPs. The central idea is to
separate two types of knowledge that are usually entangled during training: (i)
*structural knowledge*, encoded by the stable activation patterns induced by
ReLU activations; and (ii) *quantitative knowledge*, carried by the numerical
weights and biases. By fixing the structure once stabilized, GLAI reformulates
the MLP as a combination of paths, where only the quantitative component is
optimized. This reformulation retains the universal approximation capabilities
of MLPs, yet achieves a more efficient training process, reducing training time
by ~40% on average across the cases examined in this study. Crucially, GLAI is
not just another classifier, but a generic block that can replace MLPs wherever
they are used, from supervised heads with frozen backbones to projection layers
in self-supervised learning or few-shot classifiers. Across diverse
experimental setups, GLAI consistently matches or exceeds the accuracy of MLPs
with an equivalent number of parameters, while converging faster. Overall, GLAI
establishes a new design principle that opens a direction for future
integration into large-scale architectures such as Transformers, where MLP
blocks dominate the computational footprint.

Abstract: This paper investigates the impact of the loss function in value-based
methods for reinforcement learning through an analysis of underlying prediction
objectives. We theoretically show that mean absolute error is a better
prediction objective than the traditional mean squared error for controlling
the learned policy's suboptimality gap. Furthermore, we present results that
different loss functions are better aligned with these different regression
objectives: binary and categorical cross-entropy losses with the mean absolute
error and squared loss with the mean squared error. We then provide empirical
evidence that algorithms minimizing these cross-entropy losses can outperform
those based on the squared loss in linear reinforcement learning.

Motivation: 基因表达数据特征选择对于提高分类性能和降低高维数据集计算成本至关重要，需要有效整合现有流行技术。

Method: 开发BoMGene混合方法，集成Boruta和mRMR两种特征选择技术，在25个公开基因表达数据集上使用SVM、随机森林、XGBoost和GBM等分类器进行实验。

Conclusion: BoMGene方法在多类基因表达数据分析中具有明显优势，为高维生物信息学数据提供了有效的特征选择解决方案。

Abstract: Feature selection is a crucial step in analyzing gene expression data,
enhancing classification performance, and reducing computational costs for
high-dimensional datasets. This paper proposes BoMGene, a hybrid feature
selection method that effectively integrates two popular techniques: Boruta and
Minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance (mRMR). The method aims to optimize the
feature space and enhance classification accuracy. Experiments were conducted
on 25 publicly available gene expression datasets, employing widely used
classifiers such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest, XGBoost (XGB),
and Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM). The results show that using the
Boruta-mRMR combination cuts down the number of features chosen compared to
just using mRMR, which helps to speed up training time while keeping or even
improving classification accuracy compared to using individual feature
selection methods. The proposed approach demonstrates clear advantages in
accuracy, stability, and practical applicability for multi-class gene

TL;DR: 提出RiskPO方法，用风险度量替代传统均值目标，通过混合VaR目标增强困难实例的梯度信号，防止过度自信收敛，在数学推理、多模态推理和代码生成任务上显著超越GRPO方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于均值的强化学习方法（如GRPO）存在熵崩溃和推理能力提升有限的问题，主要原因是过度强调高概率输出序列而忽略了稀有但信息丰富的推理路径。

Method: 提出Risk-based Policy Optimization (RiskPO)：1）使用混合Value-at-Risk目标整合奖励分布的多个区域；2）设计捆绑方案将多个问题聚合为捆绑包，丰富反馈信号；3）理论上证明风险规避更新能缓解熵崩溃并促进探索。

Result: 在数学推理、多模态推理和代码生成基准测试中，RiskPO在Pass@1和Pass@k指标上均显著超越GRPO及其变体，实现了持续且显著的改进。

Conclusion: 基于风险的优化为增强LLM推理能力提供了一个严谨有效的范式，能够有效解决现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable reward has recently emerged as a
central paradigm for post-training large language models (LLMs); however,
prevailing mean-based methods, such as Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO), suffer from entropy collapse and limited reasoning gains. We argue that
these issues stem from overemphasizing high-probability output sequences while
neglecting rare but informative reasoning paths. To address these challenges,
we propose Risk-based Policy Optimization (RiskPO), which substitutes classical
mean-based objectives with principled risk measures. Specifically, we introduce
a Mixed Value-at-Risk objective that integrates weighted attention over
multiple regions of the reward distribution, thereby amplifying gradient
signals on challenging instances and preventing overconfident convergence. We
further design a bundling scheme that aggregates multiple questions into
bundles, thus enriching the feedback signal and yielding more stable and
informative training dynamics. Theoretically, we prove that the risk-averse
update alleviates entropy collapse and promotes exploration. Numerically,
RiskPO achieves consistent and significant improvements in mathematical
reasoning, multi-modal reasoning, and code generation benchmarks, surpassing
GRPO and its variants on both Pass@1 and Pass@k metrics. Our results
demonstrate that risk-based optimization provides a rigorous and effective
paradigm for enhancing LLM reasoning capabilities.

TL;DR: 本文提出两种修正算法来处理验证器不可靠性：反向修正通过去偏观测的二元奖励来恢复无偏策略梯度估计；前向修正通过重加权分数函数项使更新方向与干净梯度对齐，仅需假阴性率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了避免昂贵的人工标注，RLVR系统使用自动验证器训练策略，但二元奖励会引入假阴性和假阳性错误，需要解决验证器不可靠性问题。

Method: 将验证器建模为具有不对称噪声率的随机奖励通道，提出反向修正和前向修正两种算法，并在GRPO-based RLVR管道中实现为轻量级钩子。

Result: 在数学推理模型和基准测试中，两种修正方法均优于未修正训练；前向变体收敛更快且在更重噪声下保持稳定。

Conclusion: 通过轻量级LLM验证器在线估计假阴性率的实用机制，相比其他最先进方法获得了更好的性能。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) trains policies against
automated verifiers to avoid costly human labeling. To reduce vulnerability to
verifier hacking, many RLVR systems collapse rewards to binary $\{0,1\}$ during
training. This choice carries a cost: it introduces \textit{false negatives}
(rejecting correct answers, FNs) and \textit{false positives} (accepting
incorrect ones, FPs). For instance, a rule-based checker may mark the correct
fraction $\frac{12}{36}$ as wrong when compared against the canonical
$\frac{1}{3}$ due to brittle parsing/equivalence rules (FN), while a large
language model (LLM) judges can be gamed by superficial cues or even a single
adversarial token, yielding inflated correctness for wrong solutions (FP). We
formalize verifier unreliability by modeling the verifier as a stochastic
reward channel with asymmetric noise rates. From this abstraction, we derive
two correction algorithms for verifier errors. The first is a \textit{backward}
correction that de-biases the observed binary reward to recover an
\textit{unbiased} estimator of the clean policy gradient. The second is a
\textit{forward} correction that reweights score-function terms so that the
expected update direction aligns with the \textit{clean gradient}; notably, it
requires only the FN rate. We implement both as lightweight hooks in a group
relative policy optimization (GRPO)-based RLVR pipeline and evaluate them on
math-reasoning models and benchmarks. Across models and datasets, both
corrections improve over uncorrected training; the forward variant converges
faster and remains stable under heavier noise. Finally, we show a practical
appeal mechanism in which a lightweight LLM verifier estimates the FN rate
online by rechecking rule-based negatives, obtaining outperformance compared
with other state-of-the-art contenders.

<details>

Motivation: 现有大推理模型虽然能生成结构化思维链，但在安全对齐方面缺乏批判性推理能力，容易受到有缺陷前提的误导。

Method: 使用混合合成生成的对齐思维链预填充和标准提示进行强化学习训练，无需额外训练成本或修改标准RLHF流程。

Result: 显著提升安全性和抗越狱鲁棒性，减少过度拒绝，同时保持核心推理能力且不增加推理token开销。

Conclusion: RECAP训练后的模型更频繁进行自我反思，在自适应攻击下保持鲁棒性，即使经过多次推理覆盖尝试仍能维持安全性。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) "think" by generating structured
chain-of-thought (CoT) before producing a final answer, yet they still lack the
ability to reason critically about safety alignment and are easily biased when
a flawed premise is injected into their thought process. We propose RECAP
(Robust Safety Alignment via Counter-Aligned Prefilling), a principled
reinforcement learning (RL) method for post-training that explicitly teaches
models to override flawed reasoning trajectories and reroute to safe and
helpful responses. RECAP trains on a mixture of synthetically generated
counter-aligned CoT prefills and standard prompts, requires no additional
training cost or modifications beyond vanilla reinforcement learning from human
feedback (RLHF), and substantially improves safety and jailbreak robustness,
reduces overrefusal, and preserves core reasoning capability -- all while
maintaining inference token budget. Extensive analysis shows that RECAP-trained
models engage in self-reflection more frequently and remain robust under
adaptive attacks, preserving safety even after repeated attempts to override
their reasoning.

Motivation: 传统认为GRPO需要大组规模以确保稳定训练，但这带来了巨大的计算开销。本文旨在探索最小配置的可行性，以减少计算成本。

Method: 将GRPO重新框架为对比学习形式，揭示其与DPO的基本联系，并研究仅使用2个rollout的最小配置(2-GRPO)。

Result: 2-GRPO在性能上与16-GRPO相当，但只使用了1/8的rollout，训练时间减少了70%以上。

Conclusion: GRPO算法并不需要传统认为的大组规模，最小2-rollout配置即可实现良好性能，这显著降低了计算成本。

Abstract: Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) is a prominent reinforcement
learning algorithm for post-training Large Language Models (LLMs). It is
commonly believed that GRPO necessitates a large group size to ensure stable
training via precise statistical estimation, which incurs substantial
computational overhead. In this work, we challenge this assumption by reframing
GRPO as a form of contrastive learning, which reveals a fundamental connection
to Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Motivated by DPO's empirical success,
we investigate the minimal two-rollout case (2-GRPO), a configuration
previously deemed infeasible. We provide a rigorous theoretical analysis to
validate 2-GRPO and demonstrate empirically that it achieves performance on par
with 16-GRPO, despite using only 1/8 of the rollouts and reducing training time
by over 70%.

Conclusion: RCM成功地将一致性建模扩展到黎曼流形，为处理弯曲几何的生成任务提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Consistency models are a class of generative models that enable few-step
generation for diffusion and flow matching models. While consistency models
have achieved promising results on Euclidean domains like images, their
applications to Riemannian manifolds remain challenging due to the curved
geometry. In this work, we propose the Riemannian Consistency Model (RCM),
which, for the first time, enables few-step consistency modeling while
respecting the intrinsic manifold constraint imposed by the Riemannian
geometry. Leveraging the covariant derivative and exponential-map-based
parameterization, we derive the closed-form solutions for both discrete- and
continuous-time training objectives for RCM. We then demonstrate theoretical
equivalence between the two variants of RCM: Riemannian consistency
distillation (RCD) that relies on a teacher model to approximate the marginal
vector field, and Riemannian consistency training (RCT) that utilizes the
conditional vector field for training. We further propose a simplified training
objective that eliminates the need for the complicated differential
calculation. Finally, we provide a unique kinematics perspective for
interpreting the RCM objective, offering new theoretical angles. Through
extensive experiments, we manifest the superior generative quality of RCM in
few-step generation on various non-Euclidean manifolds, including flat-tori,
spheres, and the 3D rotation group SO(3).

Motivation: 脉冲神经网络作为机器学习模型具有更高的能效潜力，但由于脉冲机制的非可微性和稀疏性，基于梯度传播的传统训练方法面临困难。

Method: 将随机特征方法从人工神经网络适配到脉冲响应模型SNNs，提出S-SWIM算法，这是一种数据驱动、快速、高性能且可解释的端到端训练方法。

Result: S-SWIM在时间序列预测中达到高精度，作为独立策略有效，也可作为梯度训练的初始化策略，性能优于随机权重采样。

Conclusion: S-SWIM为SNNs训练提供了一种无需梯度近似的有效方法，在性能和效率方面表现出色，为SNNs的实际应用提供了新途径。

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) as Machine Learning (ML) models have recently
received a lot of attention as a potentially more energy-efficient alternative
to conventional Artificial Neural Networks. The non-differentiability and
sparsity of the spiking mechanism can make these models very difficult to train
with algorithms based on propagating gradients through the spiking
non-linearity. We address this problem by adapting the paradigm of Random
Feature Methods (RFMs) from Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) to Spike Response
Model (SRM) SNNs. This approach allows training of SNNs without approximation
of the spike function gradient. Concretely, we propose a novel data-driven,
fast, high-performance, and interpretable algorithm for end-to-end training of
SNNs inspired by the SWIM algorithm for RFM-ANNs, which we coin S-SWIM. We
provide a thorough theoretical discussion and supplementary numerical
experiments showing that S-SWIM can reach high accuracies on time series
forecasting as a standalone strategy and serve as an effective initialisation
strategy before gradient-based training. Additional ablation studies show that
our proposed method performs better than random sampling of network weights.

Conclusion: 这是首个在错误约束逻辑测试中实现无遗憾保证的方法，在医疗筛查等成本敏感应用中具有直接应用价值。

Abstract: We study the problem of sequentially testing individuals for a binary disease
outcome whose true risk is governed by an unknown logistic model. At each
round, a patient arrives with feature vector $x_t$, and the decision maker may
either pay to administer a (noiseless) diagnostic test--revealing the true
label--or skip testing and predict the patient's disease status based on their
feature vector and prior history. Our goal is to minimize the total number of
costly tests required while guaranteeing that the fraction of
misclassifications does not exceed a prespecified error tolerance $\alpha$,
with probability at least $1-\delta$. To address this, we develop a novel
algorithm that interleaves label-collection and distribution estimation to
estimate both $\theta^{*}$ and the context distribution $P$, and computes a
conservative, data-driven threshold $\tau_t$ on the logistic score
$|x_t^\top\theta|$ to decide when testing is necessary. We prove that, with
probability at least $1-\delta$, our procedure does not exceed the target
misclassification rate, and requires only $O(\sqrt{T})$ excess tests compared
to the oracle baseline that knows both $\theta^{*}$ and the patient feature
distribution $P$. This establishes the first no-regret guarantees for
error-constrained logistic testing, with direct applications to cost-sensitive
medical screening. Simulations corroborate our theoretical guarantees, showing
that in practice our procedure efficiently estimates $\theta^{*}$ while
retaining safety guarantees, and does not require too many excess tests.

Motivation: 研究发现插入无意义token序列能持续提升LLM推理性能，但这种现象的机制尚不清楚，需要更深入的分析和更原则性的方法。

Method: 提出激活重分布模块(ARM)，这是一种轻量级的推理时技术，直接修改激活值而不改变输入序列。ARM自适应识别非线性函数后的接近零激活值并将其向外移动，以可控方式重现无意义token的有益效果。

Result: 在多种基准测试和模型架构上的广泛实验表明，ARM能持续提升LLM在推理任务上的性能，且只需几行简单代码即可实现。

Conclusion: 研究不仅为无意义token的意外益处提供了清晰的机制解释，还提供了一种简单有效的技术，利用激活重分布来进一步提升LLM性能。

Abstract: Motivated by the puzzling observation that inserting long sequences of
meaningless tokens before the query prompt can consistently enhance LLM
reasoning performance, this work analyzes the underlying mechanism driving this
phenomenon and based on these insights proposes a more principled method that
allows for similar performance gains. First, we find that the improvements
arise from a redistribution of activations in the LLM's MLP layers, where near
zero activations become less frequent while large magnitude activations
increase. This redistribution enhances the model's representational capacity by
suppressing weak signals and promoting stronger, more informative ones.
Building on this insight, we propose the Activation Redistribution Module
(ARM), a lightweight inference-time technique that modifies activations
directly without altering the input sequence. ARM adaptively identifies
near-zero activations after the non-linear function and shifts them outward,
implicitly reproducing the beneficial effects of meaningless tokens in a
controlled manner. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks and model
architectures clearly show that ARM consistently improves LLM performance on
reasoning tasks while requiring only a few lines of simple code to implement.
Our findings deliver both a clear mechanistic explanation for the unexpected
benefits of meaningless tokens and a simple yet effective technique that
harnesses activation redistribution to further improve LLM performance.

Conclusion: CurES通过系统优化提示选择和rollout分配策略，显著提升了大语言模型在推理任务上的训练效率和性能。

Abstract: Curriculum learning plays a crucial role in enhancing the training efficiency
of large language models (LLMs) on reasoning tasks. However, existing methods
often fail to adequately account for variations in prompt difficulty or rely on
simplistic filtering mechanisms to select prompt datasets within a narrow
criterion range, resulting in significant computational waste. In this work, we
approach the problem from the perspective of reinforcement learning gradient
optimization, offering a systematic and theoretical investigation into how to
improve the training efficiency of LLMs. We identify two key factors
influencing training efficiency: the selection of training prompts and the
allocation of rollout quantities across different prompts. Our theoretical
analysis reveals that the sampling distribution of prompts dictates the
convergence rate of gradient descent, while the allocation of the rollout
quantity influences the consistency and stability of overall gradient updates.
Based on these insights, we propose CurES, an efficient training method that
accelerates convergence and employs Bayesian posterior estimation to minimize
computational overhead. Experiments demonstrate that our CurES outperforms
Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) by \textbf{+3.30} points and
\textbf{+4.82} points with 1.5B and 7B models, respectively. Additionally,
CurES exhibits faster convergence compared to baselines, including GRPO.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PINNs和相关方法在处理奇异摄动边界值问题的尖锐梯度时存在困难，通常需要域分解但会引入复杂的界面惩罚。X-TFC虽然避免了多目标优化，但在边界层问题上计算效率低下且与分解不兼容。

Method: 使用可微分的逻辑门替代硬接口，动态调整径向基函数核宽度，实现软学习的域分解。引入算子条件元学习层，学习从PDE参数到最优门配置的概率映射。

Result: 在1D对流-扩散基准测试中，Gated X-TFC比标准X-TFC误差降低一个数量级，使用80%更少的配点，训练时间减少66%。可扩展到多子域和高维问题。

Conclusion: Gated X-TFC为PINNs提供了一个简单而准确的替代方案，在具有挑战性的边界层区域既精确又计算高效。未来工作将关注非线性问题。

Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) and related methods struggle to
resolve sharp gradients in singularly perturbed boundary value problems without
resorting to some form of domain decomposition, which often introduce complex
interface penalties. While the Extreme Theory of Functional Connections (X-TFC)
avoids multi-objective optimization by employing exact boundary condition
enforcement, it remains computationally inefficient for boundary layers and
incompatible with decomposition. We propose Gated X-TFC, a novel framework for
both forward and inverse problems, that overcomes these limitations through a
soft, learned domain decomposition. Our method replaces hard interfaces with a
differentiable logistic gate that dynamically adapts radial basis function
(RBF) kernel widths across the domain, eliminating the need for interface
penalties. This approach yields not only superior accuracy but also dramatic
improvements in computational efficiency: on a benchmark one dimensional (1D)
convection-diffusion, Gated X-TFC achieves an order-of-magnitude lower error
than standard X-TFC while using 80 percent fewer collocation points and
reducing training time by 66 percent. In addition, we introduce an
operator-conditioned meta-learning layer that learns a probabilistic mapping
from PDE parameters to optimal gate configurations, enabling fast,
uncertainty-aware warm-starting for new problem instances. We further
demonstrate scalability to multiple subdomains and higher dimensions by solving
a twin boundary-layer equation and a 2D Poisson problem with a sharp Gaussian
source. Overall, Gated X-TFC delivers a simple alternative alternative to PINNs
that is both accurate and computationally efficient for challenging
boundar-layer regimes. Future work will focus on nonlinear problems.

Method: 开发GEM框架，包括标准化环境-代理接口、异步向量化执行、灵活包装器，以及多样化的环境套件和集成工具，并与五个流行的RL训练框架兼容。

Result: 提供了24个环境的基准测试，使用ReBN的REINFORCE方法，并在单轮和多轮设置中对PPO、GRPO和REINFORCE进行了公平比较。

Conclusion: GEM不仅作为训练环境，还作为评估工具包，有望加速未来代理式LLM研究的发展。

Abstract: The training paradigm for large language models (LLMs) is moving from static
datasets to experience-based learning, where agents acquire skills via
interacting with complex environments. To facilitate this transition we
introduce GEM (General Experience Maker), an open-source environment simulator
designed for the age of LLMs. Analogous to OpenAI-Gym for traditional
reinforcement learning (RL), GEM provides a standardized framework for the
environment-agent interface, including asynchronous vectorized execution for
high throughput, and flexible wrappers for easy extensibility. GEM also
features a diverse suite of environments, robust integrated tools, and
single-file example scripts demonstrating using GEM with five popular RL
training frameworks. Along with this, we also provide a set of baselines across
24 environments using REINFORCE with Return Batch Normalization (ReBN), which
-- unlike GRPO -- is compatible with the full RL setting of dense per-turn
rewards and offers better credit assignment. We further conduct apple-to-apple
benchmarking of PPO, GRPO and REINFORCE in both single- and multi-turn settings
using GEM to shed light on the algorithmic designs. Lastly, GEM also functions
as a convenient evaluation toolkit besides a training environment. We hope this
framework can help accelerate future agentic LLM research.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了秘密诱导技术，旨在发现AI拥有但不会明确表达的知识。通过在三个场景中训练LLM拥有特定知识但在被直接询问时否认，测试了多种黑盒和白盒诱导方法的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究如何发现AI模型中隐藏但实际拥有的知识，这些知识在直接询问时会被否认，但在下游任务中会被应用。

Method: 训练三个家族的LLM模型，使其拥有特定知识但在直接询问时否认。设计了多种黑盒和白盒诱导技术，包括预填充攻击、logit lens和稀疏自编码器等方法。

Result: 大多数技术相比简单基线有所改进。在2/3场景中，基于预填充攻击的黑盒技术最有效；在剩余场景中，基于logit lens和稀疏自编码器的白盒技术最有效。

Conclusion: 建立了公开基准用于评估秘密诱导方法，证明了多种技术能够有效发现AI隐藏的知识，其中预填充攻击在多数情况下表现最佳。

Abstract: We study secret elicitation: discovering knowledge that an AI possesses but
does not explicitly verbalize. As a testbed, we train three families of large
language models (LLMs) to possess specific knowledge that they apply downstream
but deny knowing when asked directly. For example, in one setting, we train an
LLM to generate replies that are consistent with knowing the user is female,
while denying this knowledge when asked directly. We then design various
black-box and white-box secret elicitation techniques and evaluate them based
on whether they can help an LLM auditor successfully guess the secret
knowledge. Many of our techniques improve on simple baselines. Our most
effective techniques (performing best in 2/3 settings) are based on prefill
attacks, a black-box technique where the LLM reveals secret knowledge when
generating a completion from a predefined prefix. In our remaining setting,
white-box techniques based on logit lens and sparse autoencoders (SAEs) are
most effective. We release our models and code, establishing a public benchmark
for evaluating secret elicitation methods.

Abstract: Preprint Note: This is the author preprint version of a paper accepted for
presentation at the IISE Annual Conference & Expo 2025. The final version will
appear in the official proceedings.
  Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a leading cause of blindness in working-age
adults, and current diagnostic methods rely on resource-intensive eye exams and
specialized equipment. Image-based AI tools have shown limitations in
early-stage detection, motivating the need for alternative approaches. We
propose a non-image-based, two-level ensemble model for DR prediction using
routine laboratory test results. In the first stage, base models (Linear SVC,
Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and XGBoost) are hyperparameter tuned and
internally stacked across different configurations to optimize metrics such as
accuracy, recall, and precision. In the second stage, predictions are
aggregated using Random Forest as a meta-learner. This hierarchical stacking
strategy improves generalization, balances performance across multiple metrics,
and remains computationally efficient compared to deep learning approaches. The
model achieved Accuracy 0.9433, F1 Score 0.9425, Recall 0.9207, Precision
0.9653, ROC-AUC 0.9844, and AUPRC 0.9875, surpassing one-level stacking and FCN
baselines. These results highlight the model potential for accurate and
interpretable DR risk prediction in clinical settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的强化学习方法在处理大规模离散或连续状态/动作空间时面临挑战，虽然已有研究使用多个评论家来解决高估或低估问题，但很少有研究考虑同时使用多个演员和多个评论家的架构。

Method: 多演员多评论家架构，包括：基于非支配排序的演员选择（考虑技能和创造力因素）、使用分位数集成策略评估演员和评论家、利用最佳技能因素的演员进行开发。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has gathered much attention in recent years due to its
rapid development and rich applications, especially on control systems and
robotics. When tackling real-world applications with reinforcement learning
method, the corresponded Markov decision process may have huge discrete or even
continuous state/action space. Deep reinforcement learning has been studied for
handling these issues through deep learning for years, and one promising branch
is the actor-critic architecture. Many past studies leveraged multiple critics
to enhance the accuracy of evaluation of a policy for addressing the
overestimation and underestimation issues. However, few studies have considered
the architecture with multiple actors together with multiple critics. This
study proposes a novel multi-actor multi-critic (MAMC) deep deterministic
reinforcement learning method. The proposed method has three main features,
including selection of actors based on non-dominated sorting for exploration
with respect to skill and creativity factors, evaluation for actors and critics
using a quantile-based ensemble strategy, and exploiting actors with best skill
factor. Theoretical analysis proves the learning stability and bounded
estimation bias for the MAMC. The present study examines the performance on a
well-known reinforcement learning benchmark MuJoCo. Experimental results show
that the proposed framework outperforms state-of-the-art deep deterministic
based reinforcement learning methods. Experimental analysis also indicates the
proposed components are effective. Empirical analysis further investigates the
validity of the proposed method, and shows its benefit on complicated problems.

Motivation: 从观测数据中学习动态系统的随机模型在多个科学领域具有重要意义，但现有自编码器方法在处理随机系统时存在局限性。

Method: 基于变分自编码器框架，同时估计系统状态轨迹和噪声时间序列，支持多步系统演化和教师强制策略。

Result: 在六个测试问题上验证了方法性能，包括模拟和实验数据，展示了教师强制间隔对内部动力学性质的影响。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效学习动态系统的随机模型，相比等效架构的确定性模型具有优势。

Abstract: Learning stochastic models of dynamical systems underlying observed data is
of interest in many scientific fields. Here we propose a novel method for this
task, based on the framework of variational autoencoders for dynamical systems.
The method estimates from the data both the system state trajectories and noise
time series. This approach allows to perform multi-step system evolution and
supports a teacher forcing strategy, alleviating limitations of
autoencoder-based approaches for stochastic systems. We demonstrate the
performance of the proposed approach on six test problems, covering simulated
and experimental data. We further show the effects of the teacher forcing
interval on the nature of the internal dynamics, and compare it to the
deterministic models with equivalent architecture.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 研究发现神经网络回归中的特征坍缩会损害泛化性能，这与分类任务中的神经坍缩现象相反。通过内在维度分析，揭示了特征维度与目标维度关系对性能的影响机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然神经坍缩在分类任务中被证明有利于泛化，但在回归任务中类似的坍缩现象却会损害性能。本研究旨在解释这种差异，探索回归任务中表示几何与泛化性能的关系。

Method: 通过内在维度分析，估计最后一层特征的内在维度(ID_H)并与回归目标的内在维度(ID_Y)进行比较。在控制任务和合成数据集上进行实验验证。

Result: 坍缩模型表现出ID_H < ID_Y，导致过度压缩和泛化性能差；非坍缩模型通常保持ID_H > ID_Y。性能与ID_H的关系取决于数据量和噪声水平，识别出过度压缩和压缩不足两种状态。

Conclusion: 研究为神经回归提供了新的几何视角，并提出了通过调整特征维度来提升泛化性能的实用策略。

Abstract: Neural multivariate regression underpins a wide range of domains such as
control, robotics, and finance, yet the geometry of its learned representations
remains poorly characterized. While neural collapse has been shown to benefit
generalization in classification, we find that analogous collapse in regression
consistently degrades performance. To explain this contrast, we analyze models
through the lens of intrinsic dimension. Across control tasks and synthetic
datasets, we estimate the intrinsic dimension of last-layer features (ID_H) and
compare it with that of the regression targets (ID_Y). Collapsed models exhibit
ID_H < ID_Y, leading to over-compression and poor generalization, whereas
non-collapsed models typically maintain ID_H > ID_Y. For the non-collapsed
models, performance with respect to ID_H depends on the data quantity and noise
levels. From these observations, we identify two regimes (over-compressed and
under-compressed) that determine when expanding or reducing feature
dimensionality improves performance. Our results provide new geometric insights
into neural regression and suggest practical strategies for enhancing
generalization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统时间序列模型无法处理文本信息，而LLM在数值时间序列分析上表现不佳，需要结合两者的优势。

Method: 使用补丁式编码器-解码器架构，在200万+时间序列与文本混合样本上训练，涵盖预测、问答、解释、分类和报告生成等任务。

Result: TsLLM在需要时间序列分析与自然语言结合的任务上表现优异，填补了现有方法的空白。

Conclusion: 建立了时间序列分析的新范式，通过自然语言交互实现复杂时间推理的民主化访问。

Abstract: Time series data is fundamental to decision-making in many crucial domains
including healthcare, finance, and environmental science. However, analyzing
this data often requires incorporating unstructured contextual information,
answering domain-specific questions, and generating natural language
explanations -- capabilities that traditional time series models lack due to
their inability to process text. While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at
contextual reasoning and knowledge integration, they struggle with numerical
time series due to inefficient text-based representations and limited exposure
to temporal data during pretraining. We address this gap by augmenting an LLM
with specialized time series perception through a patch-based encoder-decoder
architecture. We train this Time Series-augmented LLM (TsLLM) on a large corpus
of over 2 million interleaved time series and text examples spanning diverse
analysis tasks: forecasting with contextual information, time series
question-answering, pattern explanation, classification with natural language
outputs, and report generation. This training enables TsLLM to leverage both
its language understanding and newly acquired temporal reasoning capabilities.
While not designed to surpass specialized models on traditional benchmarks,
TsLLM demonstrates strong performance on tasks requiring the integration of
time series analysis with natural language -- capabilities that existing
approaches cannot provide. Our work establishes a new paradigm for time series
analysis that bridges numerical computation and natural language understanding,
democratizing access to sophisticated temporal reasoning through natural
language interaction.

TL;DR: 提出A3-FL框架，通过注意力机制处理非IID生物特征数据，结合差分隐私和安全更新协议，在保护隐私的同时提高指纹识别准确率。


<details>

Motivation: 生物特征数据敏感，集中式训练存在隐私风险，传统联邦学习在处理异构数据和可解释性方面存在困难。

Method: 在中央服务器添加注意力机制，根据重要性加权本地模型更新；使用Siamese-CNN提取特征；结合差分隐私和安全更新协议保护数据。

Result: A3-FL准确率达0.8413，优于FedAvg(0.8164)、Local-only(0.7664)和Centralized(0.7997)；在差分隐私下仍保持0.8330的高准确率。

Conclusion: A3-FL框架为分布式环境提供了可扩展且隐私敏感的生物特征识别系统，在准确性和隐私保护方面表现优异。

Abstract: Because biometric data is sensitive, centralized training poses a privacy
risk, even though biometric recognition is essential for contemporary
applications. Federated learning (FL), which permits decentralized training,
provides a privacy-preserving substitute. Conventional FL, however, has trouble
with interpretability and heterogeneous data (non-IID). In order to handle
non-IID biometric data, this framework adds an attention mechanism at the
central server that weights local model updates according to their
significance. Differential privacy and secure update protocols safeguard data
while preserving accuracy. The A3-FL framework is evaluated in this study using
FVC2004 fingerprint data, with each client's features extracted using a Siamese
Convolutional Neural Network (Siamese-CNN). By dynamically modifying client
contributions, the attention mechanism increases the accuracy of the global
model.The accuracy, convergence speed, and robustness of the A3-FL framework
are superior to those of standard FL (FedAvg) and static baselines, according
to experimental evaluations using fingerprint data (FVC2004). The accuracy of
the attention-based approach was 0.8413, while FedAvg, Local-only, and
Centralized approaches were 0.8164, 0.7664, and 0.7997, respectively. Accuracy
stayed high at 0.8330 even with differential privacy. A scalable and
privacy-sensitive biometric system for secure and effective recognition in
dispersed environments is presented in this work.

TL;DR: COUNTS是首个使用强化学习训练LLM在时间序列任务上进行链式思维推理的框架，通过两阶段训练显著提升了LLM在复杂时间序列分析中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有时间序列模型无法执行复杂的多步推理过程，如反事实分析、逻辑推理等，而LLM在时间序列任务上表现不佳，需要专门训练来提升推理能力。

Method: 使用残差向量量化VAE创建高保真离散token，集成到预训练LLM词汇表中；采用两阶段训练：先监督微调掌握时间序列表示，然后用组相对策略优化在可验证问题上训练，鼓励显式推理步骤。

Result: 实验表明，这种强化学习方法结合中间链式思维推理显著提升了LLM在各种时间序列分析任务中的性能。

Conclusion: COUNTS框架为复杂时间序列数据推理开辟了新可能性，证明了RL驱动的链式思维推理在时间序列分析中的有效性。

Abstract: Complex numerical time series analysis often demands multi-step reasoning
capabilities beyond current models' reach. Tasks like medical diagnosis and
weather forecasting require sequential reasoning processes -- including
counterfactual analysis, logical deduction, knowledge application, and
multi-modal contextual integration -- that existing time series models cannot
explicitly perform. While recent research has shown large language models
(LLMs) can achieve sophisticated Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning through
reinforcement learning (RL), these advances have primarily focused on
mathematical and coding domains, with LLMs still demonstrating poor performance
on time series tasks. We introduce Chain Of thought for Understanding Numerical
Time Series (COUNTS), the first framework that trains LLMs to perform CoT
reasoning across diverse time series tasks using RL with verifiable rewards.
Our approach employs a Residual Vector-Quantized VAE to create high-fidelity
discrete tokens that seamlessly integrate into a pre-trained LLM's vocabulary.
COUNTS undergoes a two-stage training process: first, supervised fine-tuning on
time series analysis tasks to master our novel representations, followed by
Group Relative Policy Optimization training on verifiable problems using
prompting strategies that encourage explicit reasoning steps before producing
final answers. Our experiments demonstrate that this RL-driven approach with
intermediate CoT reasoning significantly enhances LLM performance across
various time series analysis tasks, opening new possibilities for complex
temporal data reasoning.

Motivation: 传统机器学习方法在高维欧几里得空间中难以捕捉序列数据的复杂关系和层次结构，这限制了序列分类和相似性度量的准确性。

Method: 将生物序列特征表示转换到双曲面空间，在双曲面上映射序列以保留其固有结构信息，然后基于双曲面特征计算核矩阵来捕捉序列间的成对相似性。

Result: 实验评估表明该方法能有效捕捉重要序列相关性并提高分类准确率。

Conclusion: 在双曲面空间中表示生物序列特征能够更好地处理序列数据的复杂关系，为基因组序列分析提供了更有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Genomic sequence analysis plays a crucial role in various scientific and
medical domains. Traditional machine-learning approaches often struggle to
capture the complex relationships and hierarchical structures of sequence data
when working in high-dimensional Euclidean spaces. This limitation hinders
accurate sequence classification and similarity measurement. To address these
challenges, this research proposes a method to transform the feature
representation of biological sequences into the hyperboloid space. By applying
a transformation, the sequences are mapped onto the hyperboloid, preserving
their inherent structural information. Once the sequences are represented in
the hyperboloid space, a kernel matrix is computed based on the hyperboloid
features. The kernel matrix captures the pairwise similarities between
sequences, enabling more effective analysis of biological sequence
relationships. This approach leverages the inner product of the hyperboloid
feature vectors to measure the similarity between pairs of sequences. The
experimental evaluation of the proposed approach demonstrates its efficacy in
capturing important sequence correlations and improving classification
accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统推理训练导致LLMs产生长思维链，虽然提高准确率但增加了上下文长度、计算成本和延迟。希望找到在帕累托前沿上的更好平衡点。

Method: 提出PDR框架：1) 并行生成多样化草稿；2) 蒸馏到有界文本工作空间；3) 基于工作空间进行精炼。通过控制并行度来管理上下文长度。

Result: PDR实例在数学任务上比长思维链获得更高准确率且延迟更低。在AIME 2024上提升11%，AIME 2025上提升9%。

Conclusion: 迭代推理管道在匹配顺序预算下超越单次推理基线，PDR带来最大收益。成功模型编排引发是否需要进一步训练来改变帕累托前沿的问题。

Abstract: Reasoning training incentivizes LLMs to produce long chains of thought (long
CoT), which among other things, allows them to explore solution strategies with
self-checking. This results in higher accuracy, but inflates context length,
token/compute cost, and answer latency. We ask: Can current models leverage
their metacognition to provide other combinations on this Pareto frontier,
e.g., better accuracy with lower context length and/or latency? Abstractly, we
view the model as an improvement operator on its own "thoughts" with a
continuum of possible strategies. We identify an interesting inference family
Parallel-Distill-Refine (PDR), which performs the following: (i) generate
diverse drafts in parallel; (ii) distill them into a bounded, textual
workspace; and (iii) refine conditioned on this workspace, producing an output
that seeds the next round. Importantly, context length (hence compute cost) is
controllable via degree of parallelism, and is no longer conflated with the
total number of generated tokens. We report PDR instantiations of current
models that give better accuracy than long CoT while incurring lower latency.
Setting degree of parallelism to 1 yields an interesting subcase, Sequential
Refinement (SR) (iteratively improve a single candidate answer) which provides
performance superior to long CoT. Success of such model orchestrations raises
the question whether further training could shift the Pareto frontier. To this
end, we train an 8B thinking model with Reinforcement Learning (RL) to make it
consistent with PDR as the inference method. On math tasks with verifiable
answers, iterative pipelines surpass single-pass baselines at matched
sequential budgets, with PDR delivering the largest gains (e.g., +11% on AIME
2024 and +9% on AIME 2025).

Conclusion: 提出了一个系统性的多轮强化学习训练配方，指导环境、奖励和策略的协同设计，促进代理RL的研究和实践应用。

Abstract: We study what actually works and what doesn't for training large language
models as agents via multi-turn reinforcement learning. Despite rapid progress,
existing frameworks and definitions are fragmented, and there is no systematic
formulation or analysis of which design choices matter across tasks. We address
this gap by first breaking down the design space into three inter-related
pillars -- environment, reward, and policy -- and empirically derive a recipe
for training LLM agents in situated textual domains. In particular, we test
TextWorld and ALFWorld, popular domains for testing situated embodied
reasoning, as well as SWE-Gym for more software engineering style tasks. (i)
For the environment, we analyze the impacts of task complexity in terms of
sizes of the state and action spaces as well as optimal solution length,
finding that even simple environments within a domain can provide signal on how
well an agent can generalize to more complex tasks. (ii) For the reward, we
ablate relative reward sparsity, observing that while dense turn-level rewards
accelerate training, performance and stability is highly dependent on the
choice of RL algorithm. (iii) And for the agent's policy, we explore the
interplay between reward sparsity and biased (PPO, GRPO) and unbiased (RLOO)
policy gradient methods in addition to showing how to find the optimal
Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT) to RL training ratio given a fixed budget. We
distill these findings into a training recipe that guides co-design across the
three pillars, facilitating research and practical efforts in multi-turn
agentic RL. Code: https://github.com/pearls-lab/meow-tea-taro

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于通过强化学习后训练LLM对批处理和提示选择策略仍然敏感，需要找到平衡生成效率和梯度质量的最佳训练方法，并关注对策略有信息量的中等难度提示。

Method: 设计PCL算法，使用并发更新的价值模型以在线方式识别当前策略的中等难度提示，通过关注产生高有效比的信息提示来优化训练。

Result: 相比基于rollout的过滤方法，PCL在MATH和DeepScaleR数据集上分别实现了12.1倍和16.9倍的更快速度识别中等难度提示，同时达到最高性能或显著减少达到相当性能所需时间。

Conclusion: PCL提供了一种新方法，在推理导向的强化学习中实现了上限性能与效率之间更好的权衡，价值模型能准确预测提示难度并引导关注逐渐更具挑战性的提示。

Abstract: We introduce Prompt Curriculum Learning (PCL), a lightweight reinforcement
learning (RL) algorithm that selects intermediate-difficulty prompts using a
learned value model to post-train language models. Since post-training LLMs via
RL remains sensitive to batching and prompt selection strategies, we first
conduct a series of systematic experiments where we (1) determine the optimal
training batch size that balances generation efficiency and gradient quality
and (2) establish the importance of focusing on prompts of intermediate
difficulty for the policy. We build upon these results to design PCL, which
identifies prompts of intermediate difficulty for the current policy in an
on-policy manner by using a value model that is concurrently updated based on
the current policy. By focusing on informative prompts that yield high
effective ratios, PCL achieves either the highest performance or requires
significantly less time to reach comparable performance to its counterparts.
Compared to rollout-based filtering methods, PCL avoids costly rollouts and
achieves $12.1\times$ and $16.9\times$ faster speed on identifying
intermediate-difficulty prompts when training on MATH and DeepScaleR,
respectively. We further demonstrate that our value model accurately predicts
prompt difficulty and allows PCL to focus on progressively more challenging
prompts during RL. Our results present a new methodology that delivers improved
tradeoff between upper-bound performance and efficiency for reasoning-focused
RL.

TL;DR: TabINR是一个基于隐式神经表示(INR)的表格数据插补框架，通过建模表格为神经函数来处理缺失值问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界表格数据经常存在缺失值，传统插补方法容易引入偏差或扭曲数据分布，需要能够提供高质量插补、适应不同数据集大小且推理快速的插补器。

Method: 采用自解码器架构的隐式神经表示框架，引入可学习的行和特征嵌入来处理表格数据的离散结构，可以从部分观测中推断嵌入，实现实例自适应插补而无需修改训练模型。

Result: 在12个真实世界数据集和多种缺失机制下评估，显示出持续强大的插补准确性，在大多数情况下匹配或优于传统方法(KNN、MICE、MissForest)和深度学习模型(GAIN、ReMasker)，在高维数据集上优势最明显。

Conclusion: TabINR框架为表格数据缺失值问题提供了一种有效的解决方案，在保持高质量插补的同时具有良好的泛化能力和推理效率。

Abstract: Tabular data builds the basis for a wide range of applications, yet
real-world datasets are frequently incomplete due to collection errors, privacy
restrictions, or sensor failures. As missing values degrade the performance or
hinder the applicability of downstream models, and while simple imputing
strategies tend to introduce bias or distort the underlying data distribution,
we require imputers that provide high-quality imputations, are robust across
dataset sizes and yield fast inference. We therefore introduce TabINR, an
auto-decoder based Implicit Neural Representation (INR) framework that models
tables as neural functions. Building on recent advances in generalizable INRs,
we introduce learnable row and feature embeddings that effectively deal with
the discrete structure of tabular data and can be inferred from partial
observations, enabling instance adaptive imputations without modifying the
trained model. We evaluate our framework across a diverse range of twelve
real-world datasets and multiple missingness mechanisms, demonstrating
consistently strong imputation accuracy, mostly matching or outperforming
classical (KNN, MICE, MissForest) and deep learning based models (GAIN,
ReMasker), with the clearest gains on high-dimensional datasets.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一种基于随机矩阵理论的梯度去噪算法，用于提高差分隐私微调大语言模型的样本效率，通过恢复梯度的低秩结构来加速优化过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DP-SGD虽然提供强隐私保证，但添加的噪声会破坏梯度矩阵的低秩结构，增加熵值，从而降低优化效率。

Method: 使用随机矩阵理论对梯度进行后处理去噪，恢复低秩结构，提高与原始信号的对齐度。

Result: 在GLUE任务上对RoBERTa进行DP-SGD微调时，相比现有方法提高了样本效率，显著减少了达到满意性能所需的训练时间。

Conclusion: 矩阵恢复技术可以在不损害隐私保证的前提下，有效提升私有语言模型训练的实用性。

Abstract: We address the challenge of sample efficiency in differentially private
fine-tuning of large language models (LLMs) using DP-SGD. While DP-SGD provides
strong privacy guarantees, the added noise significantly increases the entropy
of gradient matrices, disrupting their low-rank structure and slowing
optimization. We propose a post-processing algorithm that leverages random
matrix theory to denoise gradients, restore low-rank structure, and improve
alignment with the original signal. Applied to DP-SGD fine-tuning of RoBERTa on
GLUE tasks, our method improves sample efficiency compared to state-of-the-art
approaches, substantially reducing training time when optimal performance is
not required. This work demonstrates that matrix recovery techniques can
enhance the utility of private language model training without compromising
privacy guarantees.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的多边际轨迹推断方法ALI-CFM，通过对抗性学习拟合神经参数化的插值曲线，在空间转录组学和细胞追踪数据集上优于现有基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在仅有离散时间点观测数据而无真实轨迹的情况下，建模动态过程并推断潜在轨迹是一个重要但困难的任务。现有多边际轨迹推断算法存在局限性，需要新的解决方案。

Method: ALI-CFM方法使用GAN启发的对抗性损失来拟合源点和目标点之间的神经参数化插值曲线，确保中间时间点的边际分布接近观测分布，然后通过流匹配算法对插值进行边际化。

Result: 该方法在空间转录组学和细胞追踪数据集上表现优于现有基线方法，在单细胞轨迹预测任务上与基线方法表现相当。生成的插值轨迹在温和假设下具有唯一性。

Conclusion: ALI-CFM方法具有多功能性和可扩展性，能够有效解决多边际轨迹推断问题，为仅有离散观测数据的动态过程建模提供了新的有效工具。

Abstract: Learning the dynamics of a process given sampled observations at several time
points is an important but difficult task in many scientific applications. When
no ground-truth trajectories are available, but one has only snapshots of data
taken at discrete time steps, the problem of modelling the dynamics, and thus
inferring the underlying trajectories, can be solved by multi-marginal
generalisations of flow matching algorithms. This paper proposes a novel flow
matching method that overcomes the limitations of existing multi-marginal
trajectory inference algorithms. Our proposed method, ALI-CFM, uses a
GAN-inspired adversarial loss to fit neurally parametrised interpolant curves
between source and target points such that the marginal distributions at
intermediate time points are close to the observed distributions. The resulting
interpolants are smooth trajectories that, as we show, are unique under mild
assumptions. These interpolants are subsequently marginalised by a flow
matching algorithm, yielding a trained vector field for the underlying
dynamics. We showcase the versatility and scalability of our method by
outperforming the existing baselines on spatial transcriptomics and cell
tracking datasets, while performing on par with them on single-cell trajectory
prediction.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: M2PO是一种异步强化学习算法，通过约束重要性权重的二阶矩来抑制极端异常值，同时保留信息性更新，实现了在高延迟数据下的稳定离策略训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有强化学习算法大多依赖同策略训练，需要每次更新时生成新的数据，限制了效率和可扩展性。异步RL系统虽然解耦了数据生成和训练，但在处理高延迟数据时性能会下降或崩溃。

Method: 提出M2PO（二阶矩信任策略优化），通过约束重要性权重的二阶矩来仅抑制极端异常值，同时保留信息性更新。该方法显著减少了高延迟下被裁剪的token比例。

Result: 在6个模型（1.7B到32B）和8个基准测试上的广泛评估表明，M2PO即使在数据延迟达到256个模型更新的情况下也能实现稳定的离策略训练，并匹配同策略性能。

Conclusion: M2PO通过适当利用延迟数据，实现了与同策略训练相当的性能，为大规模语言模型推理的高效强化学习训练提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has been central to recent advances in large language
model reasoning, but most algorithms rely on on-policy training that demands
fresh rollouts at every update, limiting efficiency and scalability.
Asynchronous RL systems alleviate this by decoupling rollout generation from
training, yet their effectiveness hinges on tolerating large staleness in
rollout data, a setting where existing methods either degrade in performance or
collapse. We revisit this challenge and uncover a prosperity-before-collapse
phenomenon: stale data can be as informative as on-policy data if exploited
properly. Building on this insight, we introduce M2PO (Second-Moment Trust
Policy Optimization), which constrains the second moment of importance weights
to suppress only extreme outliers while preserving informative updates.
Notably, M2PO sharply reduces the fraction of clipped tokens under high
staleness (from 1.22% to 0.06% over training), precisely masking high-variance
tokens while maintaining stable optimization. Extensive evaluation across six
models (from 1.7B to 32B) and eight benchmarks shows that M2PO delivers stable
off-policy training even with data stale by at least 256 model updates and
matches on-policy performance.

Motivation: 尽管上下文学习在大型语言模型中持续有效，但其工作机制仍不明确。研究旨在阐明预训练分布的统计特性如何塑造上下文学习能力，特别是对数值任务的影响。

Method: 开发了统一任务选择和泛化的理论框架，将贝叶斯后验一致性和集中性结果推广到重尾先验和依赖序列，并通过实证研究分析预训练分布对上下文学习性能的影响。

Result: 研究发现预训练分布的统计特性（如尾部行为、覆盖范围）直接影响上下文学习的样本效率、任务检索能力和鲁棒性。在随机微分方程和带记忆的随机过程等挑战性任务中表现明显。

Conclusion: 控制预训练分布的关键统计特性对于构建具备上下文学习能力和可靠的大型语言模型至关重要。

Abstract: The emergence of in-context learning (ICL) in large language models (LLMs)
remains poorly understood despite its consistent effectiveness, enabling models
to adapt to new tasks from only a handful of examples. To clarify and improve
these capabilities, we characterize how the statistical properties of the
pretraining distribution (e.g., tail behavior, coverage) shape ICL on numerical
tasks. We develop a theoretical framework that unifies task selection and
generalization, extending and sharpening earlier results, and show how
distributional properties govern sample efficiency, task retrieval, and
robustness. To this end, we generalize Bayesian posterior consistency and
concentration results to heavy-tailed priors and dependent sequences, better
reflecting the structure of LLM pretraining data. We then empirically study how
ICL performance varies with the pretraining distribution on challenging tasks
such as stochastic differential equations and stochastic processes with memory.
Together, these findings suggest that controlling key statistical properties of
the pretraining distribution is essential for building ICL-capable and reliable
LLMs.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一个统一的多目标对齐框架，通过标准化过程奖励模型训练、多动作头DPO方法和向量化奖励，同时优化数学准确性、人类价值观和多轮对话等多个目标，减少目标间权衡并提供细粒度推理时用户控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大语言模型对齐方法通常将异构信号压缩为单一优化目标，无法同时处理可验证奖励（如数学准确性）、非验证主观偏好（如人类价值观）和复杂交互场景（如多轮AI辅导对话）等多维度对齐需求。

Method: 1. 标准化过程奖励模型训练，监督模型的思维链推理；2. 使用多动作头DPO进行多目标对齐；3. 采用向量化奖励，各维度对应不同目标而非单一标量；4. 提供细粒度推理时用户控制。

Result: 在数学推理、价值对齐和多轮对话等任务上的实验表明，该框架能同时提升多个目标的性能，最小化跨目标权衡，并实现灵活的推理时用户控制。

Conclusion: 该统一框架成功解决了多目标对齐中的目标冲突问题，通过向量化奖励和多动作头DPO实现了更高效的多目标优化，同时提供了更好的用户控制能力。

Abstract: Aligning large language models to human preferences is inherently
multidimensional, yet most pipelines collapse heterogeneous signals into a
single optimizeable objective. We seek to answer what it would take to
simultaneously align a model across various domains spanning those with:
verifiable rewards (mathematical accuracy), non-verifiable subjective
preferences (human values), and complex interactive scenarios (multi-turn AI
tutoring dialogues). Such multi-objective reinforcement learning setups are
often plagued by the individual objectives being at odds with each other,
resulting in inefficient training and little user control during inference. We
propose a unified framework that: (i) standardizes {process reward model} (PRM)
training across both verifiable and non-verifiable settings to better supervise
models' chain-of-thought reasoning; (ii) performs {multi-objective alignment}
by training the LLM with our $\textbf{M}$ulti-$\textbf{A}$ction-$\textbf{H}$ead
$\textbf{DPO}$ (MAH-DPO) and a vectorized reward where the dimensions of the
vector correspond to the various objectives instead of a single scalar; and
(iii) demonstrates how such a system provides fine-grained inference-time user
control. Experiments across math reasoning, value alignment, and multi-turn
dialogue show that our framework improves performance across multiple
objectives simultaneously, while minimizing cross-objective trade-offs and
enabling flexible inference time user control. The code can be found at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 金融领域机器学习模型需要大量高质量数据，但现实世界数据在数量、质量和多样性方面存在限制，阻碍了交易和投资模型的性能提升。

Method: 开发了Fiaingen时间序列数据生成技术，通过降维空间重叠度、下游机器学习任务性能和运行时性能三个标准来评估生成质量。

Result: 实验表明该方法在三个评估标准上都达到了最先进水平，生成的合成数据能紧密反映原始时间序列特征，生成时间接近秒级，且基于合成数据训练的模型性能接近真实数据训练结果。

Conclusion: Fiaingen方法能有效缓解金融数据短缺问题，生成高质量合成数据，为机器学习模型提供可靠的数据支持，具有良好的可扩展性。

Abstract: Data is vital in enabling machine learning models to advance research and
practical applications in finance, where accurate and robust models are
essential for investment and trading decision-making. However, real-world data
is limited despite its quantity, quality, and variety. The data shortage of
various financial assets directly hinders the performance of machine learning
models designed to trade and invest in these assets. Generative methods can
mitigate this shortage. In this paper, we introduce a set of novel techniques
for time series data generation (we name them Fiaingen) and assess their
performance across three criteria: (a) overlap of real-world and synthetic data
on a reduced dimensionality space, (b) performance on downstream machine
learning tasks, and (c) runtime performance. Our experiments demonstrate that
the methods achieve state-of-the-art performance across the three criteria
listed above. Synthetic data generated with Fiaingen methods more closely
mirrors the original time series data while keeping data generation time close
to seconds - ensuring the scalability of the proposed approach. Furthermore,
models trained on it achieve performance close to those trained with real-world
data.

Motivation: 尽管归一化技术在深度学习中广泛应用，但其理论理解相对有限。本文旨在建立权重归一化在过参数化矩阵感知问题中的理论优势。

Method: 使用广义权重归一化结合黎曼优化方法来解决过参数化矩阵感知问题。

Result: 证明了权重归一化能实现线性收敛，迭代复杂度和样本复杂度随着过参数化程度的增加而多项式级改善。

Conclusion: 这是首个刻画权重归一化如何利用过参数化实现矩阵感知问题更快收敛的理论工作。

Abstract: While normalization techniques are widely used in deep learning, their
theoretical understanding remains relatively limited. In this work, we
establish the benefits of (generalized) weight normalization (WN) applied to
the overparameterized matrix sensing problem. We prove that WN with Riemannian
optimization achieves linear convergence, yielding an exponential speedup over
standard methods that do not use WN. Our analysis further demonstrates that
both iteration and sample complexity improve polynomially as the level of
overparameterization increases. To the best of our knowledge, this work
provides the first characterization of how WN leverages overparameterization
for faster convergence in matrix sensing.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有示例搜索方法仅优化预测准确性，忽视了模型校准这一影响可信度和安全部署的关键因素。

Method: 将示例选择建模为多目标优化问题，使用样本高效的组合贝叶斯优化算法(COM-BOM)寻找准确性和校准误差之间的帕累托前沿。

Result: 在MMLU-Pro基准测试的多个任务上，COM-BOM在联合优化两个目标方面优于或匹配基线方法，且仅需最少的LLM API调用。

Conclusion: COM-BOM能够有效平衡预测准确性和模型校准，为可信赖的上下文学习提供了更好的示例选择方案。

Abstract: Selecting an optimal set of exemplars is critical for good performance of
in-context learning. However, prior exemplar search methods narrowly optimize
for predictive accuracy, critically neglecting model calibration--a key
determinant of trustworthiness and safe deployment. In this paper, we formulate
exemplar selection as a multi-objective optimization problem, explicitly
targeting both the maximization of predictive accuracy and the minimization of
expected calibration error. We solve this problem with a sample-efficient
Combinatorial Bayesian Optimization algorithm (COM-BOM) to find the Pareto
front that optimally trades off the two objectives of accuracy and calibration.
We evaluate COM-BOM on multiple tasks from unsaturated MMLU-Pro benchmark and
find that COM-BOM beats or matches the baselines at jointly optimizing the two
objectives, while requiring a minimal number of LLM API calls.

Conclusion: Toucan数据集通过提供大规模、高质量、多样化的工具-智能体训练数据，有效推动了开源工具-智能体系统的发展。

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) agents are rapidly emerging as powerful systems
for automating tasks across domains. Yet progress in the open-source community
is constrained by the lack of high quality permissively licensed tool-agentic
training data. Existing datasets are often limited in diversity, realism, and
complexity, particularly regarding multi-tool and multi-turn interactions. To
address this gap, we introduce Toucan, the largest publicly available
tool-agentic dataset to date, containing 1.5 million trajectories synthesized
from nearly 500 real-world Model Context Protocols (MCPs). Unlike prior work,
Toucan leverages authentic MCP environments to generate diverse, realistic, and
challenging tasks with trajectories involving real tool execution. Our pipeline
first produces a broad spectrum of tool-use queries using five distinct models,
applies model-based quality filtering, and then generates agentic trajectories
with three teacher models using two agentic frameworks. Rigorous rule-based and
model-based validation ensures high-quality outputs. We also introduce three
extension mechanisms to further diversify tasks and simulate multi-turn
conversations. Models fine-tuned on Toucan outperform larger closed-source
counterparts on the BFCL V3 benchmark and push the Pareto frontier forward on
MCP-Universe Bench.

Motivation: 现有ProRL方法通过增加训练步数来扩展RL，但性能在数千步后达到平台期，存在明显的收益递减。本文探索通过增加每个样本的rollout数量来扩展RL的补充范式。

Method: 基于质量平衡方程分析，提出BroRL方法，将每个样本的rollout数量增加到数百个，进行充分探索。理论分析表明随着rollout数量增加，未采样项的影响会减弱，确保正确token概率质量的扩展。

Result: BroRL能够复活在3K步ProRL训练后饱和的模型，并展现出稳健的持续改进，在1.5B模型上实现了跨多个基准测试的最先进结果。

Conclusion: 增加每个样本的rollout数量是扩展强化学习的有效补充方法，能够突破训练步数增加带来的性能饱和问题，实现持续的性能提升。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as a key
ingredient for unlocking complex reasoning capabilities in large language
models. Recent work ProRL has shown promise in scaling RL by increasing the
number of training steps. However, performance plateaus after thousands of
steps, with clear diminishing returns from allocating more computation to
additional training. In this work, we investigate a complementary paradigm for
scaling RL, BroR-Lincreasing the number of rollouts per example to hundreds to
exhaustively Broaden exploration, which yields continuous performance gains
beyond the saturation point observed in ProRL when scaling the number of
training steps. Our approach is motivated by a mass balance equation analysis
allowing us to characterize the rate of change in probability mass for correct
and incorrect tokens during the reinforcement process. We show that under a
one-step RL assumption, sampled rollout tokens always contribute to
correct-mass expansion, while unsampled tokens outside rollouts may lead to
gains or losses depending on their distribution and the net reward balance.
Importantly, as the number of rollouts per example N increases, the effect of
unsampled terms diminishes, ensuring overall correct-mass expansion. To
validate our theoretical analysis, we conduct simulations under more relaxed
conditions and find that a sufficiently large rollout size N-corresponding to
ample exploration-guarantees an increase in the probability mass of all correct
tokens. Empirically, BroRL revives models saturated after 3K ProRL training
steps and demonstrates robust, continuous improvement, achieving
state-of-the-art results for the 1.5B model across diverse benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散模型缺乏对采样多样性的直接控制能力，用户无法灵活调整生成样本的分布特性。

Method: 通过重新缩放噪声数据分布的（学习到的）得分函数来控制局部采样温度，该方法兼容确定性和随机性采样器。

Result: 在图像生成、姿态估计、深度预测、机器人操作和蛋白质设计等五个不同任务上验证，能够从更尖锐或更平坦的分布中采样，提升性能。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种简单有效的采样多样性控制机制，适用于各种预训练模型，在多个任务中都能带来性能提升。

Abstract: We present a mechanism to steer the sampling diversity of denoising diffusion
and flow matching models, allowing users to sample from a sharper or broader
distribution than the training distribution. We build on the observation that
these models leverage (learned) score functions of noisy data distributions for
sampling and show that rescaling these allows one to effectively control a
`local' sampling temperature. Notably, this approach does not require any
finetuning or alterations to training strategy, and can be applied to any
off-the-shelf model and is compatible with both deterministic and stochastic
samplers. We first validate our framework on toy 2D data, and then demonstrate
its application for diffusion models trained across five disparate tasks --
image generation, pose estimation, depth prediction, robot manipulation, and
protein design. We find that across these tasks, our approach allows sampling
from sharper (or flatter) distributions, yielding performance gains e.g., depth
prediction models benefit from sampling more likely depth estimates, whereas
image generation models perform better when sampling a slightly flatter
distribution. Project page: https://temporalscorerescaling.github.io

TL;DR: 提出Dirichlet-Prior Shaping Loss (DPSL)方法，通过匹配专家分配与目标Dirichlet先验来直接塑造路由概率分布，解决了预训练密集模型转换为稀疏MoE时专家专业化不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将预训练密集模型升级为稀疏MoE能有效增加模型容量，但由于简单的权重复制导致专家专业化不足，即使使用常规正则化，升级后的MoE仍表现出低置信度、弱差异化的路由，影响性能。

Method: 引入DPSL路由器正则化技术，直接通过匹配专家分配与目标Dirichlet先验来塑造路由概率分布，提供对专家平衡和专业化的细粒度控制，并能编码归纳偏置。

Result: 在升级的MoE视觉语言模型实验中，DPSL在标准视觉语言基准测试中始终优于其他升级策略和正则化技术，解决了专业化不足的关键问题。

Conclusion: DPSL是一种通用工具，适用于任何输出分类概率分布的模块，能促进更自适应、更高性能的模型，解决了MoE训练中专家专业化不足的核心问题。

Abstract: Upcycling pre-trained dense models into sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoEs)
efficiently increases model capacity but often suffers from poor expert
specialization due to naive weight replication. Our analysis reveals that
upcycled MoEs, even with conventional regularization, exhibit low-confidence,
weakly differentiated routing, hindering performance. We introduce
Dirichlet-Prior Shaping Loss (DPSL), a novel router regularization technique
that directly shapes routing probability distributions by matching expert
assignments to a target Dirichlet prior. DPSL offers fine-grained control over
expert balance and specialization, and enables encoding of inductive biases
such as encouraging experts to focus on specific modalities or tasks, without
requiring manual intervention; notably, DPSL is a general tool applicable to
any module that outputs categorical probability distributions, extending its
utility beyond MoE training. Experiments on upcycled MoE vision-language models
(with Qwen2, Phi3, Llama3.2 LLM backbones) show DPSL consistently outperforms
upcycling strategies and regularization techniques across standard
vision-language benchmarks, addressing the critical issue of poor
specialization and fostering more adaptive, higher-performing models.

Motivation: 现有基于噪声对比估计的对比损失函数与AUC无关，导致检索器校准不佳和下游任务性能次优

Method: 引入MW损失函数，最大化Mann-Whitney U统计量（等同于AUC），通过最小化得分差异的二元交叉熵来优化正负样本对的排序

Result: 实验表明MW损失在AUC和标准检索指标上持续优于对比损失，产生更好校准和更具区分度的检索器

Conclusion: MW损失是对比损失的经验优越替代方案，特别适用于RAG等高风险应用场景

Abstract: Dual-encoder retrievers depend on the principle that relevant documents
should score higher than irrelevant ones for a given query. Yet the dominant
Noise Contrastive Estimation (NCE) objective, which underpins Contrastive Loss,
optimizes a softened ranking surrogate that we rigorously prove is
fundamentally oblivious to score separation quality and unrelated to AUC. This
mismatch leads to poor calibration and suboptimal performance in downstream
tasks like retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). To address this fundamental
limitation, we introduce the MW loss, a new training objective that maximizes
the Mann-Whitney U statistic, which is mathematically equivalent to the Area
under the ROC Curve (AUC). MW loss encourages each positive-negative pair to be
correctly ranked by minimizing binary cross entropy over score differences. We
provide theoretical guarantees that MW loss directly upper-bounds the AoC,
better aligning optimization with retrieval goals. We further promote ROC
curves and AUC as natural threshold free diagnostics for evaluating retriever
calibration and ranking quality. Empirically, retrievers trained with MW loss
consistently outperform contrastive counterparts in AUC and standard retrieval
metrics. Our experiments show that MW loss is an empirically superior
alternative to Contrastive Loss, yielding better-calibrated and more
discriminative retrievers for high-stakes applications like RAG.

Abstract: The HLTCOE team applied PLAID, an mT5 reranker, GPT-4 reranker, score fusion,
and document translation to the TREC 2024 NeuCLIR track. For PLAID we included
a variety of models and training techniques -- Translate Distill (TD), Generate
Distill (GD) and multi-lingual translate-distill (MTD). TD uses scores from the
mT5 model over English MS MARCO query-document pairs to learn how to score
query-document pairs where the documents are translated to match the CLIR
setting. GD follows TD but uses passages from the collection and queries
generated by an LLM for training examples. MTD uses MS MARCO translated into
multiple languages, allowing experiments on how to batch the data during
training. Finally, for report generation we experimented with system
combination over different runs. One family of systems used either GPT-4o or
Claude-3.5-Sonnet to summarize the retrieved results from a series of
decomposed sub-questions. Another system took the output from those two models
and verified/combined them with Claude-3.5-Sonnet. The other family used GPT4o
and GPT3.5Turbo to extract and group relevant facts from the retrieved
documents based on the decomposed queries. The resulting submissions directly
concatenate the grouped facts to form the report and their documents of origin
as the citations. The team submitted runs to all NeuCLIR tasks: CLIR and MLIR
news tasks as well as the technical documents task and the report generation
task.

*Prabhav Goyal,Vinesh Sridhar,Wilson Zheng*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 提出了第一个支持动态更新的强历史无关学习增强数据结构，通过阈值化和配对技术实现隐私安全保证与性能的平衡


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 学习增强数据结构使用频率预测来提升性能，但其隐私安全影响未被充分研究。在安全漏洞事件中，数据结构应只泄露当前内容信息，特别是布局会随数据变化的学习增强结构需要历史无关性保证

Method: 引入两种技术：阈值化（使任何学习增强数据结构具有鲁棒性）和配对（在动态设置中提供强历史无关性的简单技术）

Result: 实验结果显示安全性与效率之间存在权衡，但性能仍与现有技术相当

Conclusion: 这是向学习增强数据结构隐私安全保证方向迈出的第一步，提出的技术能够实现强历史无关性、鲁棒性和动态更新支持

Abstract: Learning-augmented data structures use predicted frequency estimates to
retrieve frequently occurring database elements faster than standard data
structures. Recent work has developed data structures that optimally exploit
these frequency estimates while maintaining robustness to adversarial
prediction errors. However, the privacy and security implications of this
setting remain largely unexplored.
  In the event of a security breach, data structures should reveal minimal
information beyond their current contents. This is even more crucial for
learning-augmented data structures, whose layout adapts to the data. A data
structure is history independent if its memory representation reveals no
information about past operations except what is inferred from its current
contents. In this work, we take the first step towards privacy and security
guarantees in this setting by proposing the first learning-augmented data
structure that is strongly history independent, robust, and supports dynamic
updates.
  To achieve this, we introduce two techniques: thresholding, which
automatically makes any learning-augmented data structure robust, and pairing,
a simple technique that provides strong history independence in the dynamic
setting. Our experimental results demonstrate a tradeoff between security and
efficiency but are still competitive with the state of the art.

*Thong Nguyen,Yibin Lei,Jia-Huei Ju,Eugene Yang,Andrew Yates*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: MILCO是一个多语言稀疏检索架构，通过多语言连接器将不同语言的查询和文档映射到共享的英语词汇空间，结合稀疏对齐预训练和对比训练，在保持表示透明性和有效性的同时缓解语义崩溃问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有学习稀疏检索方法难以扩展到英语以外的语言，且在将不常见实体投影到英语时容易丢失信息。

Method: 采用两阶段训练机制：稀疏对齐预训练和对比训练，并引入LexEcho头通过特殊[ECHO]令牌增强英语词汇表示。

Result: 在多语言和跨语言LSR任务中达到最先进性能，优于BGE-M3和Qwen3-Embed等基线方法，支持通过后剪枝实现动态效率。

Conclusion: MILCO在保持高效率的同时实现了卓越的多语言检索性能，特别是在稀疏表示下仍能超越密集模型。

Abstract: Learned Sparse Retrieval (LSR) combines the efficiency of bi-encoders with
the transparency of lexical matching, but existing approaches struggle to scale
beyond English. We introduce MILCO, an LSR architecture that maps queries and
documents from different languages into a shared English lexical space via a
multilingual connector. MILCO is trained with a specialized two-stage regime
that combines Sparse Alignment Pretraining with contrastive training to provide
representation transparency and effectiveness while mitigating semantic
collapse. Motivated by the observation that uncommon entities are often lost
when projected into English, we propose a new LexEcho head, which enhances
robustness by augmenting the English lexical representation with a
source-language view obtained through a special [ECHO] token. MILCO achieves
state-of-the-art multilingual and cross-lingual LSR performance, outperforming
leading dense, sparse, and multi-vector baselines such as BGE-M3 and
Qwen3-Embed on standard multilingual benchmarks, while supporting dynamic
efficiency through post-hoc pruning. Notably, when using mass-based pruning to
reduce document representations to only 30 active dimensions on average, MILCO
560M outperforms the similarly-sized Qwen3-Embed 0.6B with 1024 dimensions.

TL;DR: L2G是一个新颖的框架，通过从列表式重排序器日志中隐式诱导文档图，实现了无需显式图计算的可扩展图基检索。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图感知自适应检索需要预计算的文档相似图，但这样的图通常不可用或内存成本高；而图自由重排序器依赖大量LLM调用。L2G旨在实现图基检索的有效性，同时避免显式图计算的开销。

Method: L2G通过将重排序器信号转换为图结构，隐式地从列表式重排序器日志中诱导文档图，从而支持可扩展的图基检索。

Result: 在TREC-DL和BEIR子集上的结果显示，L2G与基于oracle的图方法效果相当，且无需额外的LLM调用。

Conclusion: L2G框架成功实现了图基检索的有效性，同时避免了显式图计算和额外LLM调用的开销。

Abstract: Reranker improves retrieval performance by capturing document interactions.
At one extreme, graph-aware adaptive retrieval (GAR) represents an
information-rich regime, requiring a pre-computed document similarity graph in
reranking. However, as such graphs are often unavailable, or incur quadratic
memory costs even when available, graph-free rerankers leverage large language
model (LLM) calls to achieve competitive performance. We introduce L2G, a novel
framework that implicitly induces document graphs from listwise reranker logs.
By converting reranker signals into a graph structure, L2G enables scalable
graph-based retrieval without the overhead of explicit graph computation.
Results on the TREC-DL and BEIR subset show that L2G matches the effectiveness
of oracle-based graph methods, while incurring zero additional LLM calls.

Motivation: 传统CLIR研究将任务视为单语检索加上翻译，将检索方法和跨语言能力孤立处理。随着跨语言嵌入和多语言大语言模型的出现，需要全面梳理从翻译方法到最新嵌入驱动和生成技术的发展。

Method: 采用综述研究方法，系统梳理CLIR的发展历程，从早期翻译方法到嵌入驱动方法，再到多语言大语言模型的应用，分析核心组件、评估实践和可用资源。

Result: 识别了CLIR领域的持续挑战，如数据不平衡和语言变异，同时指出了改进检索性能和实现答案生成的新范式，为构建稳健、包容和适应性强的检索系统提供了方向。

Conclusion: 通过将CLIR置于信息检索和多语言处理的更广泛背景下，本工作不仅回顾了当前能力，还为构建稳健、包容和适应性强的检索系统指明了未来方向。

Abstract: Cross-lingual information retrieval (CLIR) addresses the challenge of
retrieving relevant documents written in languages different from that of the
original query. Research in this area has typically framed the task as
monolingual retrieval augmented by translation, treating retrieval methods and
cross-lingual capabilities in isolation. Both monolingual and cross-lingual
retrieval usually follow a pipeline of query expansion, ranking, re-ranking
and, increasingly, question answering. Recent advances, however, have shifted
from translation-based methods toward embedding-based approaches and leverage
multilingual large language models (LLMs), for which aligning representations
across languages remains a central challenge. The emergence of cross-lingual
embeddings and multilingual LLMs has introduced a new paradigm, offering
improved retrieval performance and enabling answer generation. This survey
provides a comprehensive overview of developments from early translation-based
methods to state-of-the-art embedding-driven and generative techniques. It
presents a structured account of core CLIR components, evaluation practices,
and available resources. Persistent challenges such as data imbalance and
linguistic variation are identified, while promising directions are suggested
for advancing equitable and effective cross-lingual information retrieval. By
situating CLIR within the broader landscape of information retrieval and
multilingual language processing, this work not only reviews current
capabilities but also outlines future directions for building retrieval systems
that are robust, inclusive, and adaptable.

TL;DR: 本研究应用堆叠自编码器和AraBERT嵌入来改进阿拉伯语文本数据在聚合搜索环境中的聚类效果，通过K-means算法发现搜索结果中的特征和关系，显著提升了聚类准确性和相关性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于互联网信息爆炸，需要开发能够提升各种格式内容检索和管理的聚合搜索系统。传统搜索引擎存在不精确、上下文不相关且不个性化的问题，需要更丰富、上下文感知的搜索结果表征。

Method: 使用堆叠自编码器和AraBERT嵌入等先进自然语言处理技术，结合K-means聚类算法来发现搜索结果中的独特特征和关系，并在不同阿拉伯语查询上评估方法有效性。

Result: 模型表明堆叠自编码器在表示学习中适合聚类任务，能显著改善搜索结果聚类，同时展示了搜索结果准确性和相关性的提升。

Conclusion: 堆叠自编码器在表示学习中的使用特别适合聚类任务，能够显著提高搜索结果的聚类效果，并改善搜索结果的准确性和相关性。

Abstract: Due to an information explosion on the internet, there is a need for the
development of aggregated search systems that can boost the retrieval and
management of content in various formats. To further improve the clustering of
Arabic text data in aggregated search environments, this research investigates
the application of advanced natural language processing techniques, namely
stacked autoencoders and AraBERT embeddings. By transcending the limitations of
traditional search engines, which are imprecise, not contextually relevant, and
not personalized, we offer more enriched, context-aware characterizations of
search results, so we used a K-means clustering algorithm to discover
distinctive features and relationships in these results, we then used our
approach on different Arabic queries to evaluate its effectiveness. Our model
illustrates that using stacked autoencoders in representation learning suits
clustering tasks and can significantly improve clustering search results. It
also demonstrates improved accuracy and relevance of search results.

Motivation: 现有的多模态嵌入模型通常通过对比损失在文本-图像对上微调大型视觉语言解码器来构建，虽然成本效益高，但这种方法往往会限制检索性能。

Method: 通过受控实验建立改进视觉文档检索模型的原理性方法，重点关注注意力掩码、图像分辨率、模态对齐数据机制以及以晚期交互为中心的对比目标等关键因素。

Result: 基于这些洞察发布了ModernVBERT，这是一个紧凑的2.5亿参数视觉语言编码器，在文档检索任务上微调后，性能优于大10倍的模型。

Conclusion: 本文为构建更高效的视觉文档检索模型提供了系统的方法论，证明了通过精心设计的训练策略，小模型也能在特定任务上超越大模型。

Abstract: Multimodal embedding models are gaining prevalence, notably for document
retrieval as efficient alternatives to text-only pipelines. These models are
typically built by finetuning large vision-language decoders (VLMs) with
contrastive losses on text-image pairs. In this work, we show that, while
cost-efficient, this repurposing approach often bottlenecks retrieval
performance. Through controlled experiments, we establish a principled recipe
for improving visual document retrieval models. We notably measure the impact
of attention masking, image resolution, modality alignment data regimes, and
late interaction centered contrastive objectives which emerge as central
performance factors. Building on these insights, we release ModernVBERT, a
compact 250M-parameter vision-language encoder that outperforms models up to 10
times larger when finetuned on document retrieval tasks. Models and code are
made available at https://huggingface.co/ModernVBERT.

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 该研究通过康德公理视角重新解释学生对生成式AI感知成功的蒙特卡洛模拟，发现有限离散样本无法满足无限稠密连续统的理想属性，揭示了经验观察与形式结构之间的认识论边界。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 重新解释现有蒙特卡洛模拟结果，通过康德公理框架探讨学生对生成式AI感知的结构性特征，揭示有限经验数据与无限理想属性之间的认识论差异。

Method: 使用代表性数据集中的主题级调查统计数据生成10,000个合成评分，通过无端点稠密线性序(DLO)公理评估模拟输出，包括自反性、传递性、完全可比性、无端点和稠密性。

Result: 基本排序公理(A1-A3)得到满足，但无端点(A4-A5)和稠密性(A6)公理失败，这反映了有限离散样本的固有局限性而非方法缺陷。

Conclusion: 模拟捕捉的有限量化观察无法实例化无界稠密连续统的理想属性，这些属性属于建构性直觉而非有限抽样，揭示了经验模型与形式结构之间的认识论边界。

Abstract: This study reinterprets a Monte Carlo simulation of students' perceived
success with generative AI (GenAI) through a Kantian-axiomatic lens. Building
on prior work, theme-level survey statistics Ease of Use and Learnability,
System Efficiency and Learning Burden, and Perceived Complexity and Integration
from a representative dataset are used to generate 10,000 synthetic scores per
theme on the [1,5] Likert scale. The simulated outputs are evaluated against
the axioms of dense linear order without endpoints (DLO): irreflexivity,
transitivity, total comparability (connectedness), no endpoints (no greatest
and no least; A4-A5), and density (A6). At the data level, the basic ordering
axioms (A1-A3) are satisfied, whereas no-endpoints (A4-A5) and density (A6)
fail as expected. Likert clipping introduces minimum and maximum observed
values, and a finite, discretized sample need not contain a value strictly
between any two distinct scores. These patterns are read not as methodological
defects but as markers of an epistemological boundary. Following Kant and
Friedman, the findings suggest that what simulations capture finite, quantized
observations cannot instantiate the ideal properties of an unbounded, dense
continuum. Such properties belong to constructive intuition rather than to
finite sampling alone. A complementary visualization contrasts the empirical
histogram with a sine-curve proxy to clarify this divide. The contribution is
interpretive rather than data-expansive: it reframes an existing simulation as
a probe of the synthetic a priori structure underlying students' perceptions,
showing how formal order-theoretic coherence coexists with principled failures
of endpoint-freeness and density in finite empirical models.

TL;DR: AI技术通过数字广告和社交媒体算法对共和主义自由观构成威胁，创造了新的不自由形式——数字支配，需要建立问责机制来保护个人自由。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨AI技术如何威胁共和主义的自由观（即免受不可问责权力的自由），强调在AI融入社会时需要保护这种自由。

Method: 通过分析数字广告和社交媒体算法的影响，借鉴Quentin Skinner、Philip Pettit等共和主义理论家的著作。

Result: AI在个人层面能潜意识影响行为和思想，在政治层面让科技公司高管和外国势力能影响国内政治进程，形成数字支配。

Conclusion: 个人必须拥有对算法及其开发者的问责机制才能真正获得自由。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence is set to revolutionize social and political life in
unpredictable ways, raising questions about the principles that ought to guide
its development and regulation. By examining digital advertising and social
media algorithms, this article highlights how artificial intelligence already
poses a significant threat to the republican conception of liberty -- or
freedom from unaccountable power -- and thereby highlights the necessity of
protecting republican liberty when integrating artificial intelligence into
society. At an individual level, these algorithms can subconsciously influence
behavior and thought, and those subject to this influence have limited power
over the algorithms they engage. At the political level, these algorithms give
technology company executives and other foreign parties the power to influence
domestic political processes, such as elections; the multinational nature of
algorithm-based platforms and the speed with which technology companies
innovate make incumbent state institutions ineffective at holding these actors
accountable. At both levels, artificial intelligence has thus created a new
form of unfreedom: digital domination. By drawing on the works of Quentin
Skinner, Philip Pettit, and other republican theorists, this article asserts
that individuals must have mechanisms to hold algorithms (and those who develop
them) accountable in order to be truly free.

Motivation: 专辑封面作为艺术与商业交汇的视觉艺术形式，能够反映文化、技术和商业动态的演变，但此前缺乏系统性研究。

Method: 使用多种计算度量方法，捕捉专辑封面视觉复杂性的多个维度，分析75年间11种流行音乐类型的专辑封面。

Result: 发现大多数音乐类型的专辑封面呈现向极简主义转变的趋势，但随时间推移方差增大，许多封面仍保持高抽象度和复杂度。

Conclusion: 专辑封面是丰富的可量化文化历史档案，计算方法在系统性艺术研究中具有重要价值，能够连接定量分析与美学文化研究。

Abstract: The study of art evolution has provided valuable insights into societal
change, often revealing long-term patterns of simplification and
transformation. Album covers represent a distinctive yet understudied form of
visual art that has both shaped and been shaped by cultural, technological, and
commercial dynamics over the past century. As highly visible artifacts at the
intersection of art and commerce, they offer a unique lens through which to
study cultural evolution. In this work, we examine the visual complexity of
album covers spanning 75 years and 11 popular musical genres. Using a diverse
set of computational measures that capture multiple dimensions of visual
complexity, our analysis reveals a broad shift toward minimalism across most
genres, with notable exceptions that highlight the heterogeneity of aesthetic
trends. At the same time, we observe growing variance over time, with many
covers continuing to display high levels of abstraction and intricacy.
Together, these findings position album covers as a rich, quantifiable archive
of cultural history and underscore the value of computational approaches in the
systematic study of the arts, bridging quantitative analysis with aesthetic and
cultural inquiry.

Abstract: Effective tool use is essential for agentic AI, yet training agents to
utilize tools remains challenging due to manually designed rewards, limited
training data, and poor multi-tool selection, resulting in slow adaptation,
wasted computational resources, and suboptimal performance. We introduce
ToolBrain, a lightweight and user-friendly framework for coaching tool use in
agentic models with flexible reinforcement learning (RL), easing the barriers
for researchers and practitioners to adapt LLM-based agents to specific
domains. It supports a wide range of training strategies, including RL
algorithms such as GRPO and DPO, as well as supervised learning. ToolBrain
enables custom reward callables directly on an agent's execution traces or
simply utilizes an automated LLM-as-a-judge system for reward generation. It is
packed with useful capabilities, including knowledge distillation from large to
small models for efficient development, automatic task generation from tool
descriptions, seamless tool retrieval, efficient fine-tuning pipelines with
QLoRA through Unsloth, and quantized inference via bitsandbytes. We demonstrate
ToolBrain through diverse use cases, such as training a CodeAct agent to
autonomously execute email search tasks, showing fast, targeted improvements
(up to 30.0%) in tool-use skills while keeping the codebase simple and
extensible in Agentic AI. Our framework is publicly available at

Motivation: 大型推理语言模型在复杂推理任务中表现出色，但存在计算效率低下的问题，现有方法难以平衡推理质量与推理成本降低。

Method: ARS是一种无需训练的方法，通过多检查点确定性估计机制和渐进抑制阈值，动态抑制冗余推理步骤。

Result: 在数学推理基准测试中，ARS实现了53%的token减少、46.1%的延迟减少和57.9%的能耗减少，同时保持或提高了准确性。

Conclusion: ARS在多个模型架构上验证了其有效性，相比静态抑制方法具有更优越的效率表现。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Language Models (LRLMs or LRMs) demonstrate remarkable
capabilities in complex reasoning tasks, but suffer from significant
computational inefficiencies due to overthinking phenomena. Existing efficient
reasoning methods face the challenge of balancing reasoning quality with
inference cost reduction. We propose \textbf{Adaptive Reasoning Suppression
(ARS)}, a novel training-free approach that dynamically suppresses redundant
reasoning steps while preserving accuracy through adaptive certainty
monitoring. ARS introduces a multi-checkpoint certainty estimation mechanism
with progressive suppression thresholds, achieving superior efficiency compared
to static suppression methods. Our extensive evaluation across mathematical
reasoning benchmarks using multiple model architectures demonstrates that ARS
achieves up to 53%, 46.1%, and 57.9% in token, latency and energy reduction,

Motivation: 当前AI政策制定缺乏科学共识形成机制，而NeurIPS作为AI领域的领先会议，具备推动这一进程的独特优势和责任。

Method: 建议NeurIPS开展初始试点项目，借鉴IPCC在气候政策共识形成方面的经验教训，主动催化AI政策领域的科学共识。

Result: 识别了当前AI政策制定中共识形成机制的完全缺失，并论证了NeurIPS是填补这一空白的最佳选择。

Conclusion: NeurIPS应该在AI政策领域引领科学共识的形成，以制定更高质量的AI政策，这符合其在AI领域的领导地位和责任。

Abstract: Designing wise AI policy is a grand challenge for society. To design such
policy, policymakers should place a premium on rigorous evidence and scientific
consensus. While several mechanisms exist for evidence generation, and nascent
mechanisms tackle evidence synthesis, we identify a complete void on consensus
formation. In this position paper, we argue NeurIPS should actively catalyze
scientific consensus on AI policy. Beyond identifying the current deficit in
consensus formation mechanisms, we argue that NeurIPS is the best option due
its strengths and the paucity of compelling alternatives. To make progress, we
recommend initial pilots for NeurIPS by distilling lessons from the IPCC's
leadership to build scientific consensus on climate policy. We dispel
predictable counters that AI researchers disagree too much to achieve consensus
and that policy engagement is not the business of NeurIPS. NeurIPS leads AI on
many fronts, and it should champion scientific consensus to create higher
quality AI policy.

Conclusion: CERTAIN项目通过其综合框架成功解决了AI系统中的伦理、法律和监管挑战，为欧洲的负责任AI发展提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence has rapidly become a cornerstone technology,
significantly influencing Europe's societal and economic landscapes. However,
the proliferation of AI also raises critical ethical, legal, and regulatory
challenges. The CERTAIN (Certification for Ethical and Regulatory Transparency
in Artificial Intelligence) project addresses these issues by developing a
comprehensive framework that integrates regulatory compliance, ethical
standards, and transparency into AI systems. In this position paper, we outline
the methodological steps for building the core components of this framework.
Specifically, we present: (i) semantic Machine Learning Operations (MLOps) for
structured AI lifecycle management, (ii) ontology-driven data lineage tracking
to ensure traceability and accountability, and (iii) regulatory operations
(RegOps) workflows to operationalize compliance requirements. By implementing
and validating its solutions across diverse pilots, CERTAIN aims to advance
regulatory compliance and to promote responsible AI innovation aligned with
European standards.

TL;DR: 该论文审计了视觉语言模型在保释决策预测中的表现，发现模型性能差且错误率高，通过RAG管道和法律先例干预以及微调方法显著提升了预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型视觉语言模型的普及，法律判决预测系统开始利用罪犯图像和文本案件报告，但这种应用可能带来意外后果和恶意使用风险，因此需要审计其效率。

Method: 首先审计独立VLM在保释决策预测中的表现，然后设计干预算法：通过RAG管道引入法律先例，并使用创新方案对VLM进行微调。

Result: 发现独立VLM在多个交叉群体中表现不佳，模型以极高置信度错误拒绝应获保释的个体；干预措施显著提高了保释预测性能。

Conclusion: 这项工作为未来在实际部署VLM进行法律判决预测前设计更智能的干预措施铺平了道路。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been extensively used for legal judgment
prediction tasks based on case reports and crime history. However, with a surge
in the availability of large vision language models (VLMs), legal judgment
prediction systems can now be made to leverage the images of the criminals in
addition to the textual case reports/crime history. Applications built in this
way could lead to inadvertent consequences and be used with malicious intent.
In this work, we run an audit to investigate the efficiency of standalone VLMs
in the bail decision prediction task. We observe that the performance is poor
across multiple intersectional groups and models \textit{wrongly deny bail to
deserving individuals with very high confidence}. We design different
intervention algorithms by first including legal precedents through a RAG
pipeline and then fine-tuning the VLMs using innovative schemes. We demonstrate
that these interventions substantially improve the performance of bail
prediction. Our work paves the way for the design of smarter interventions on
VLMs in the future, before they can be deployed for real-world legal judgment
prediction.

Abstract: Financial fraud detection in real-world scenarios presents significant
challenges due to the subtlety and dispersion of evidence across complex,
multi-year financial disclosures. In this work, we introduce a novel
multi-agent reasoning framework AuditAgent, enhanced with auditing domain
expertise, for fine-grained evidence chain localization in financial fraud
cases. Leveraging an expert-annotated dataset constructed from enforcement
documents and financial reports released by the China Securities Regulatory
Commission, our approach integrates subject-level risk priors, a hybrid
retrieval strategy, and specialized agent modules to efficiently identify and
aggregate cross-report evidence. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
method substantially outperforms General-Purpose Agent paradigm in both recall
and interpretability, establishing a new benchmark for automated, transparent
financial forensics. Our results highlight the value of domain-specific
reasoning and dataset construction for advancing robust financial fraud
detection in practical, real-world regulatory applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法依赖安全工程师手工编写大量恢复规则，但无法预见现实世界中各种意外情况，这种方法很快变得不完整。需要更智能的自适应决策系统。

Method: 利用具身AI和大视觉语言模型提供常识推理能力，在Unreal Engine模拟的城市场景中，让无人机动态解释环境并决定紧急机动以实现安全着陆。

Result: 结果表明，具身AI能够实现一类先前无法手工设计的自适应恢复和决策流程，提高了自主空中系统的弹性和安全性。

Conclusion: 具身AI使得以前无法手工设计的自适应恢复和决策流程成为可能，推动了自主空中系统的弹性和安全性发展。

Abstract: Autonomous drones must often respond to sudden events, such as alarms,
faults, or unexpected changes in their environment, that require immediate and
adaptive decision-making. Traditional approaches rely on safety engineers
hand-coding large sets of recovery rules, but this strategy cannot anticipate
the vast range of real-world contingencies and quickly becomes incomplete.
Recent advances in embodied AI, powered by large visual language models,
provide commonsense reasoning to assess context and generate appropriate
actions in real time. We demonstrate this capability in a simulated urban
benchmark in the Unreal Engine, where drones dynamically interpret their
surroundings and decide on sudden maneuvers for safe landings. Our results show
that embodied AI makes possible a new class of adaptive recovery and
decision-making pipelines that were previously infeasible to design by hand,
advancing resilience and safety in autonomous aerial systems.

Motivation: 利用社交媒体平台作为了解个体心理健康状态的窗口，开发可信赖且透明的AI系统进行抑郁症严重程度评估。

Method: 提出AttentionDep模型，使用单字和双字层次编码帖子，通过注意力机制突出临床相关标记，并利用心理健康知识图谱的领域知识通过交叉注意力机制丰富上下文特征，最后使用有序回归框架预测抑郁症严重程度。

Abstract: In today's interconnected society, social media platforms provide a window
into individuals' thoughts, emotions, and mental states. This paper explores
the use of platforms like Facebook, X (formerly Twitter), and Reddit for
depression severity detection. We propose AttentionDep, a domain-aware
attention model that drives explainable depression severity estimation by
fusing contextual and domain knowledge. Posts are encoded hierarchically using
unigrams and bigrams, with attention mechanisms highlighting clinically
relevant tokens. Domain knowledge from a curated mental health knowledge graph
is incorporated through a cross-attention mechanism, enriching the contextual
features. Finally, depression severity is predicted using an ordinal regression
framework that respects the clinical-relevance and natural ordering of severity
levels. Our experiments demonstrate that AttentionDep outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines by over 5% in graded F1 score across datasets, while
providing interpretable insights into its predictions. This work advances the
development of trustworthy and transparent AI systems for mental health
assessment from social media.

### [267] [Thinkquel: A Model Dedicated to Text-to-dbt Using Synthetic Data and a Span-Aware Objective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00186)
*Anni Li,Aria Attar,Paul Dong*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Thinkquel是一个经过微调的模型，用于生成稳健、可移植且经过执行验证的数据库查询。它集成了新颖的合成数据管道TS-SQL和专门设计的Token-Sequence GRPO（TS-GRPO）强化学习目标，以弥合令牌级训练信号与序列级执行奖励之间的差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将自然语言请求转换为可靠、生产就绪的数据转换仍然具有挑战性：正确性取决于精确的模式链接和数据仓库特定的SQL方言，而训练期间最强的监督——执行成功和结果匹配——仅在序列级别提供。同时，组装大型、经过执行验证的语料库成本高昂，令牌级目标与这些全局信号不对齐，导致优化不稳定和可移植性有限。

Method: Thinkquel集成了一个新颖的合成数据管道TS-SQL，利用dbt作为可移植的中间表示，并结合了span-aware强化学习目标Token-Sequence GRPO（TS-GRPO），专门设计用于在微调LLMs时弥合令牌级训练信号与序列级执行奖励之间的差距。

Result: 在500个示例的TS-SQL测试集上，Thinkquel（32B）通过两阶段SFT课程达到了93.2%的执行成功率和61.8%的精确结果匹配，相比基础模型提高了67.2%（执行）和44.4%（匹配）。在Spider（14B）实验中，TS-GRPO相对于GRPO和GSPO提高了训练稳定性并加速了执行匹配奖励的收敛。

Conclusion: Thinkquel通过其合成数据管道和专门的强化学习目标，成功地解决了自然语言到SQL转换中的关键挑战，实现了高执行成功率和结果匹配率，同时提高了训练稳定性和收敛速度。

Abstract: Transforming natural-language requests into reliable, production-ready data
transformations remains challenging: correctness depends on precise schema
linking and warehouse-specific SQL dialects, while the strongest supervision
available during training--execution success and result matching--are provided
only at the sequence level. At the same time, assembling large,
execution-validated corpora is costly, and token-level objectives misalign with
these global signals, yielding unstable optimization and limited portability.
We introduce Thinkquel, a fine-tuned model for producing robust, portable, and
execution-validated database queries. Methodologies in Thinkquel integrates a
novel synthetic data pipeline, TS-SQL, that leverages dbt as a portable
intermediate representation with a span-aware reinforcement learning objective,
and Token-Sequence GRPO (TS-GRPO), specifically designed to bridge the gap
between token-level training signals and sequence-level execution rewards when
finetuning LLMs. On the 500-example TS-SQL test set, Thinkquel (32B) reaches
93.2\% execution success and 61.8\% exact-result match with a two-stage SFT
curriculum, improving over the base model by 67.2\% (exec.) and 44.4\% (match).
In Spider (14B) experiments, TS-GRPO increases training stability and speeds
convergence of the execution-match reward relative to GRPO and GSPO.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种解耦微调方法，将工具调用任务分解为工具选择和参数生成两个子任务，通过专用LoRA适配器分别优化，显著提升了本地LLM在工具调用场景中的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 本地大型语言模型在工具调用场景中表现不佳，难以从大量工具集中准确选择工具并为复杂参数结构生成准确参数，需要隐私保护、成本效益高的本地推理解决方案。

Method: 采用解耦微调方法，使用LoRA微调创建专用适配器，分别处理工具选择和工具特定参数生成，并通过分层编排限制工具选择所需工具数量。

Result: 在MCP-Bench基准测试中，使用解耦微调训练的Qwen-2.5-7B模型将基础模型的工具调用准确率提高了46%，在大多数情况下优于其他类似大小的本地推理、非推理和微调模型，甚至优于2倍大的模型。

Conclusion: 解耦微调和DualTune框架有效解决了本地LLM在工具调用中的性能问题，为设备端推理提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: The deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) as agentic orchestrators has
revolutionized task automation, but the need for privacy-preserving,
cost-effective solutions demands on-device inference capabilities. However,
local LLMs consistently underperform compared to frontier models in tool
calling scenarios, struggling with both tool selection from large tool sets and
accurate argument generation for complex parameter structures. We introduce a
methodology that disaggregates a tool-calling task into two distinct subtasks:
tool selection and argument generation. We propose "decoupled fine-tuning", a
novel post-training approach that employs LoRA fine-tuning to create dedicated
LoRA adapters for tool selection and tool-specific argument generation using
separate loss masking for each of the subtasks. Furthermore, we present
DualTune, an inference framework that leverages the LoRA adapters created using
decoupled fine-tuning to perform efficient agent orchestration with the help of
local models on end-user devices. DualTune decomposes the tool-call generation
step into tool selection and argument generation, and dynamically loads the
corresponding LoRA adapters to generate tool calls. Additionally, DualTune
implements hierarchical orchestration to restrict the number of tools required
for tool selection. Our experiments on the MCP-Bench benchmark demonstrate that
the Qwen-2.5-7B model trained using decoupled fine-tuning improves the tool
calling accuracy of the base model by 46%, and outperforms other local
reasoning, non-reasoning and fine-tuned models of similar size in all cases,
and models that are 2x larger, in most cases.

TL;DR: 提出了MAGIC-MASK框架，将基于扰动的可解释性扩展到多智能体强化学习，通过智能体间协作共享掩码状态信息和经验，提高关键状态发现效率和解释保真度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度强化学习智能体的决策过程理解对于安全关键和多智能体环境部署至关重要，现有方法存在计算成本高、探索覆盖不足且缺乏多智能体适应性等问题。

Method: 集成近端策略优化、自适应ε-贪心探索和轻量级智能体间协作，通过轨迹扰动、奖励保真度分析和KL散度正则化的统一数学形式化实现可解释性。

Result: 在单智能体和多智能体基准测试中，包括多智能体高速公路驾驶环境和Google Research Football，MAGIC-MASK在保真度、学习效率和策略鲁棒性方面持续优于最先进基线。

Conclusion: 该框架通过概率建模和多智能体马尔可夫决策过程提供局部化、可解释的解释，实现了从单智能体到多智能体系统的可解释性泛化。

Abstract: Understanding the decision-making process of Deep Reinforcement Learning
agents remains a key challenge for deploying these systems in safety-critical
and multi-agent environments. While prior explainability methods like
StateMask, have advanced the identification of critical states, they remain
limited by computational cost, exploration coverage, and lack of adaptation to
multi-agent settings. To overcome these limitations, we propose a
mathematically grounded framework, MAGIC-MASK (Multi-Agent Guided Inter-agent
Collaboration with Mask-Based Explainability for Reinforcement Learning), that
extends perturbation-based explanation to Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning.
Our method integrates Proximal Policy Optimization, adaptive epsilon-greedy
exploration, and lightweight inter-agent collaboration to share masked state
information and peer experience. This collaboration enables each agent to
perform saliency-guided masking and share reward-based insights with peers,
reducing the time required for critical state discovery, improving explanation
fidelity, and leading to faster and more robust learning. The core novelty of
our approach lies in generalizing explainability from single-agent to
multi-agent systems through a unified mathematical formalism built on
trajectory perturbation, reward fidelity analysis, and Kullback-Leibler
divergence regularization. This framework yields localized, interpretable
explanations grounded in probabilistic modeling and multi-agent Markov decision
processes. We validate our framework on both single-agent and multi-agent
benchmarks, including a multi-agent highway driving environment and Google
Research Football, demonstrating that MAGIC-MASK consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines in fidelity, learning efficiency, and policy
robustness while offering interpretable and transferable explanations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索ICL指南如何影响不同知识领域的推理能力，了解ICL优化对模型认知能力的系统性影响。

Method: 使用GPT-OSS:20b模型的六个变体（一个基准模型和五个ICL配置），在840个测试中评估通用知识问题、逻辑谜题和数学奥赛问题的表现。

Result: ICL模型在通用知识任务上达到91%-99%准确率，但在复杂推理问题上性能显著下降，谜题准确率降至10-43%（基准模型为43%）。数学奥赛问题无显著差异。

Conclusion: ICL指南在效率和推理灵活性之间产生系统性权衡，对LLM部署和AI安全具有重要影响。

Abstract: ICL guides are known to improve task-specific performance, but their impact
on cross-domain cognitive abilities remains unexplored. This study examines how
ICL guides affect reasoning across different knowledge domains using six
variants of the GPT-OSS:20b model: one baseline model and five ICL
configurations (simple, chain-of-thought, random, appended text, and symbolic
language). The models were subjected to 840 tests spanning general knowledge
questions, logic riddles, and a mathematical olympiad problem. Statistical
analysis (ANOVA) revealed significant behavioral modifications (p less than
0.001) across ICL variants, demonstrating a phenomenon termed "optimized
fragility." ICL models achieved 91%-99% accuracy on general knowledge tasks
while showing degraded performance on complex reasoning problems, with accuracy
dropping to 10-43% on riddles compared to 43% for the baseline model. Notably,
no significant differences emerged on the olympiad problem (p=0.2173),
suggesting that complex mathematical reasoning remains unaffected by ICL
optimization. These findings indicate that ICL guides create systematic
trade-offs between efficiency and reasoning flexibility, with important
implications for LLM deployment and AI safety.

TL;DR: LLM代理在工具选择中存在系统性偏见，影响公平性和竞争。研究发现语义对齐是主要影响因素，并提出轻量级缓解方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM代理依赖外部工具市场，但工具选择可能存在系统性偏见，这会降低用户体验并扭曲市场竞争。

Method: 建立包含功能等效工具的多类别基准，测试7个模型，通过控制实验分析工具特征、元数据和预训练暴露的影响。

Result: 发现模型存在不公平性：要么固定选择单一提供商，要么过度偏好上下文前列的工具。语义对齐是最强预测因素，扰动描述会显著改变选择，预训练暴露会放大偏见。

Conclusion: 工具选择偏见是工具增强型LLM公平部署的关键障碍，提出的轻量级缓解方法能减少偏见同时保持良好任务覆盖。

Abstract: Agents backed by large language models (LLMs) often rely on external tools
drawn from marketplaces where multiple providers offer functionally equivalent
options. This raises a critical point concerning fairness: if selection is
systematically biased, it can degrade user experience and distort competition
by privileging some providers over others. We introduce a benchmark of diverse
tool categories, each containing multiple functionally equivalent tools, to
evaluate tool-selection bias. Using this benchmark, we test seven models and
show that unfairness exists with models either fixating on a single provider or
disproportionately preferring earlier-listed tools in context. To investigate
the origins of this bias, we conduct controlled experiments examining tool
features, metadata (name, description, parameters), and pre-training exposure.
We find that: (1) semantic alignment between queries and metadata is the
strongest predictor of choice; (2) perturbing descriptions significantly shifts
selections; and (3) repeated pre-training exposure to a single endpoint
amplifies bias. Finally, we propose a lightweight mitigation that first filters
the candidate tools to a relevant subset and then samples uniformly, reducing
bias while preserving good task coverage. Our findings highlight tool-selection
bias as a key obstacle for the fair deployment of tool-augmented LLMs.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CAIA基准测试揭示了AI模型在对抗性高风险环境中的严重缺陷，特别是在加密货币市场等需要区分真相与操纵、处理碎片化信息并做出不可逆决策的场景下，现有模型表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI评估主要关注受控环境下的任务完成能力，但真实世界部署需要模型具备对抗主动欺骗的韧性。加密货币市场在2024年因漏洞损失300亿美元，是测试AI在对抗性环境中表现的良好试验场。

Method: 使用加密货币市场作为测试平台，评估17个模型在178个时间锚定任务上的表现。这些任务要求代理区分真相与操纵、导航碎片化信息景观，并在对抗压力下做出不可逆财务决策。

Result: 无工具时，前沿模型准确率仅28%；工具增强后提升至67.4%，但仍低于人类基准80%。模型存在系统性工具选择灾难，偏好不可靠网络搜索而非权威数据源，即使正确答案可通过专业工具直接获取。

Conclusion: 当前模型尽管在推理得分上令人印象深刻，但在需要智能对抗主动反对的环境中仍基本未准备好。对抗性鲁棒性是可信AI自主性的必要条件，CAIA基准为此提供了持续更新的评估框架。

Abstract: We present CAIA, a benchmark exposing a critical blind spot in AI evaluation:
the inability of state-of-the-art models to operate in adversarial, high-stakes
environments where misinformation is weaponized and errors are irreversible.
While existing benchmarks measure task completion in controlled settings,
real-world deployment demands resilience against active deception. Using crypto
markets as a testbed where $30 billion was lost to exploits in 2024, we
evaluate 17 models on 178 time-anchored tasks requiring agents to distinguish
truth from manipulation, navigate fragmented information landscapes, and make
irreversible financial decisions under adversarial pressure.
  Our results reveal a fundamental capability gap: without tools, even frontier
models achieve only 28% accuracy on tasks junior analysts routinely handle.
Tool augmentation improves performance but plateaus at 67.4% versus 80% human
baseline, despite unlimited access to professional resources. Most critically,
we uncover a systematic tool selection catastrophe: models preferentially
choose unreliable web search over authoritative data, falling for SEO-optimized
misinformation and social media manipulation. This behavior persists even when
correct answers are directly accessible through specialized tools, suggesting
foundational limitations rather than knowledge gaps. We also find that Pass@k
metrics mask dangerous trial-and-error behavior for autonomous deployment.
  The implications extend beyond crypto to any domain with active adversaries,
e.g. cybersecurity, content moderation, etc. We release CAIA with contamination
controls and continuous updates, establishing adversarial robustness as a
necessary condition for trustworthy AI autonomy. The benchmark reveals that
current models, despite impressive reasoning scores, remain fundamentally
unprepared for environments where intelligence must survive active opposition.

Conclusion: 研究结果提出了令人惊讶的观察和有趣的进一步研究方向

Abstract: Transformers have demonstrated remarkable performance in natural language
processing and related domains, as they largely focus on sequential,
autoregressive next-token prediction tasks. Yet, they struggle in logical
reasoning, not necessarily because of a fundamental limitation of these models,
but possibly due to the lack of exploration of more creative uses, such as
latent space and recurrent reasoning. An emerging exploration in this direction
is the Hierarchical Reasoning Model (Wang et al., 2025), which introduces a
novel type of recurrent reasoning in the latent space of transformers,
achieving remarkable performance on a wide range of 2D reasoning tasks. Despite
the promising results, this line of models is still at an early stage and calls
for in-depth investigation. In this work, we perform a critical review on this
class of models, examine key design choices and present intriguing variants
that achieve significantly better performance on the Sudoku-Extreme and
Maze-Hard tasks than previously reported. Our results also raise surprising
observations and intriguing directions for further research.

Conclusion: 该框架为AI智能体通信网络提供了有前景的解决方案，在动态环境中实现高效的多智能体协作

Abstract: With the rapid growth of intelligent services, communication targets are
shifting from humans to artificial intelligent (AI) agents, which require new
paradigms to enable real-time perception, decision-making, and collaboration.
Semantic communication, which conveys task-relevant meaning rather than raw
data, offers a promising solution. However, its practical deployment remains
constrained by dynamic environments and limited resources. To address these
issues, this article proposes a semantic-driven AI agent communication
framework and develops three enabling techniques. First, semantic adaptation
transmission applies fine-tuning with real or generative samples to efficiently
adapt models to varying environments. Second, semantic lightweight transmission
incorporates pruning, quantization, and perception-aware sampling to reduce
model complexity and alleviate computational burden on edge agents. Third,
semantic self-evolution control employs distributed hierarchical
decision-making to optimize multi-dimensional resources, enabling robust
multi-agent collaboration in dynamic environments. Simulation results show that
the proposed solutions achieve faster convergence and stronger robustness,
while the proposed distributed hierarchical optimization method significantly
outperforms conventional decision-making schemes, highlighting its potential
for AI agent communication networks.

TL;DR: 提出了TRACE框架，通过让智能体自由探索和演化现有基准任务，自动生成更高难度的新任务，并记录可验证的执行轨迹，解决现有智能体基准快速达到性能上限的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有智能体基准显示出新开发智能体快速达到性能上限的趋势，难以满足评估智能体能力的需求，需要动态、自我演化的评估系统。

Method: TRACE框架包含三个阶段：进化提案挖掘（通过初步探索和发散思维提供任务进化提案）、问题形成与自由探索（将提案概念化为可行问题候选，智能体自由探索并记录执行轨迹）、多级验证（确保进化任务具有可验证和可复现的轨迹）。

Result: 在GAIA基准上的实验表明，TRACE框架能持续提升任务复杂度，同时通过可验证的执行轨迹提高正确性的可靠性。

Conclusion: 这项工作标志着从静态、人工策划的基准向动态、自我演化评估系统的范式转变，为智能体发展提供了可持续且具有挑战性的跑道。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and agent system designs have
empowered agents with unprecedented levels of capability. However, existing
agent benchmarks are showing a trend of rapid ceiling-hitting by newly
developed agents, making it difficult to meet the demands for evaluating agent
abilities. To address this problem, we propose the Trajectory-based
Validated-by-Reproducing Agent-benchmark Complexity Evolution (TRACE)
framework. This framework takes an original task from an existing benchmark and
encourages agents to freely explore and evolve it into a new task with higher
difficulty while recording validatable agent trajectories. The framework
proceeds in three stages: (1) evolutionary proposal mining, which provides task
evolution proposals through preliminary exploration and divergent thinking; (2)
problem formation and free exploration, where proposals are conceptualized into
feasible problem candidates and the agents then explore them freely while
recording their execution trajectories; and (3) multi-level validation, which
ensures that the evolved tasks are accompanied by validatable and reproducible
trajectories. Experiments on the GAIA benchmark demonstrate that the TRACE
framework consistently enhances task complexity while improving the reliability
of correctness through validatable execution trajectories. This work marks a
paradigm shift from static, manually curated benchmarks to dynamic,
self-evolving evaluation systems, providing a sustainable and challenging
runway for agent development.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该研究探讨了自动化评估AI系统回答患者健康问题的可行性，通过比较28个AI系统对100个患者问题的回答，发现精心设计的自动化评估能够有效替代人工专家评审。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前评估AI健康问答系统的主要方法——人工专家评审——耗时且难以扩展，需要寻找可靠的自动化评估方案。

Method: 收集28个AI系统对100个患者住院相关问题的2800个回答，从三个维度评估：是否回答问题、是否恰当使用临床记录证据、是否使用一般医学知识，并使用临床医生撰写的参考答案作为基准。

Result: 自动化排名与专家评分高度一致，表明自动化评估能够有效替代人工评审。

Conclusion: 精心设计的自动化评估可以扩展AI系统的比较评估，支持患者-临床医生沟通。

Abstract: Automated approaches to answer patient-posed health questions are rising, but
selecting among systems requires reliable evaluation. The current gold standard
for evaluating the free-text artificial intelligence (AI) responses--human
expert review--is labor-intensive and slow, limiting scalability. Automated
metrics are promising yet variably aligned with human judgments and often
context-dependent. To address the feasibility of automating the evaluation of
AI responses to hospitalization-related questions posed by patients, we
conducted a large systematic study of evaluation approaches. Across 100 patient
cases, we collected responses from 28 AI systems (2800 total) and assessed them
along three dimensions: whether a system response (1) answers the question, (2)
appropriately uses clinical note evidence, and (3) uses general medical
knowledge. Using clinician-authored reference answers to anchor metrics,
automated rankings closely matched expert ratings. Our findings suggest that
carefully designed automated evaluation can scale comparative assessment of AI
systems and support patient-clinician communication.

*Kenjiro Ide,Taiga Someya,Kohei Kawaguchi,Keisuke Fujii*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出EDMS方法，通过语义增强的状态表示和动作掩码机制，在足球等入侵性团队运动中构建可解释的玩家级智能体模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于规则的分析方法直观但有限，现代机器学习模型缺乏明确的智能体表示。需要从数据中构建玩家级智能体模型，使其学习到的价值和策略既具有战术可解释性，又能跨异构数据源保持稳健。

Method: EDMS方法：1）语义增强的状态表示，在原始位置和速度基础上增加关系变量（空间得分、传球、得分等）；2）动作掩码方案，为持球和无球球员提供不同的决策集；3）将学习到的价值函数和动作策略映射到人类可解释的战术概念。

Result: EDMS与动作掩码相比基线方法，持续降低了动作预测损失和时序差分误差。定性案例研究和Q值可视化显示，EDMS能突出高风险高回报的战术模式（如快速反击和防守突破）。

Conclusion: EDMS方法成功构建了可解释的玩家级智能体模型，将学习到的战术概念与比赛规则对齐，并展示了与多个商业和开源数据集的兼容性，支持跨提供者评估和可重复实验。

Abstract: Invasion team sports such as soccer produce a high-dimensional, strongly
coupled state space as many players continuously interact on a shared field,
challenging quantitative tactical analysis. Traditional rule-based analyses are
intuitive, while modern predictive machine learning models often perform
pattern-matching without explicit agent representations. The problem we address
is how to build player-level agent models from data, whose learned values and
policies are both tactically interpretable and robust across heterogeneous data
sources. Here, we propose Expandable Decision-Making States (EDMS), a
semantically enriched state representation that augments raw positions and
velocities with relational variables (e.g., scoring of space, pass, and score),
combined with an action-masking scheme that gives on-ball and off-ball agents
distinct decision sets. Compared to prior work, EDMS maps learned value
functions and action policies to human-interpretable tactical concepts (e.g.,
marking pressure, passing lanes, ball accessibility) instead of raw coordinate
features, and aligns agent choices with the rules of play. In the experiments,
EDMS with action masking consistently reduced both action-prediction loss and
temporal-difference (TD) error compared to the baseline. Qualitative case
studies and Q-value visualizations further indicate that EDMS highlights
high-risk, high-reward tactical patterns (e.g., fast counterattacks and
defensive breakthroughs). We also integrated our approach into an open-source
library and demonstrated compatibility with multiple commercial and open
datasets, enabling cross-provider evaluation and reproducible experiments.

TL;DR: 该论文挑战了传统观点，发现在14个多样化领域中，生成式结果奖励模型(GenORM)比过程奖励模型(PRM)表现更稳健，而过程奖励模型由于标签噪声和长推理轨迹评估困难而表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统观点认为过程奖励模型(PRM)优于结果奖励模型(ORM)，但这种观点主要基于数学相关领域的证据。作者旨在通过跨多个领域的统一评估来验证这一假设。

Method: 在14个多样化领域中统一评估了四种奖励模型变体：判别式ORM和PRM(DisORM, DisPRM)以及生成式ORM和PRM(GenORM, GenPRM)。

Result: 发现DisORM与DisPRM表现相当，GenPRM不具竞争力，而GenORM是最稳健的模型，在所有测试领域中都取得了显著且一致的增益。

Conclusion: 研究挑战了细粒度监督总是更好的普遍假设，支持在多领域部署中使用生成式结果验证方法。

Abstract: The reliability of large language models (LLMs) during test-time scaling is
often assessed with \emph{external verifiers} or \emph{reward models} that
distinguish correct reasoning from flawed logic. Prior work generally assumes
that process reward models (PRMs), which score every intermediate reasoning
step, outperform outcome reward models (ORMs) that assess only the final
answer. This view is based mainly on evidence from narrow, math-adjacent
domains. We present the first unified evaluation of four reward model variants,
discriminative ORM and PRM (\DisORM, \DisPRM) and generative ORM and PRM
(\GenORM, \GenPRM), across 14 diverse domains. Contrary to conventional wisdom,
we find that (i) \DisORM performs on par with \DisPRM, (ii) \GenPRM is not
competitive, and (iii) overall, \GenORM is the most robust, yielding
significant and consistent gains across every tested domain. We attribute this
to PRM-style stepwise scoring, which inherits label noise from LLM
auto-labeling and has difficulty evaluating long reasoning trajectories,
including those involving self-correcting reasoning. Our theoretical analysis
shows that step-wise aggregation compounds errors as reasoning length grows,
and our empirical observations confirm this effect. These findings challenge
the prevailing assumption that fine-grained supervision is always better and
support generative outcome verification for multi-domain deployment. We
publicly release our code, datasets, and checkpoints at
\href{https://github.com/db-Lee/Multi-RM}{\underline{\small\texttt{https://github.com/db-Lee/Multi-RM}}}
to facilitate future research in multi-domain settings.

TL;DR: 提出了VIRTUE视觉交互文本图像通用嵌入器，通过整合分割模型和视觉语言模型，使嵌入模型具备视觉交互能力，能够处理用户指定的感兴趣区域，在36个通用MMEB任务和5个视觉交互SCaR任务上取得显著性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有嵌入模型缺乏视觉交互能力，无法处理用户指定的感兴趣区域（如点、边界框、掩码），限制了其在需要局部定位用户意图的应用中的潜力。

Method: 结合分割模型和视觉语言模型，分割模型处理视觉提示以精确定位图像中的特定区域，使嵌入器能够更精确地处理复杂和模糊场景。

Result: 在36个通用MMEB任务上提升3.1%-8.5%，在5个视觉交互SCaR任务上提升15.2%-20.3%，达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: VIRTUE成功将分割模型和视觉语言模型的能力扩展到表示学习领域，为嵌入模型引入了视觉交互能力，解锁了新的应用场景并提升了实体级信息学习能力。

Abstract: Multimodal representation learning models have demonstrated successful
operation across complex tasks, and the integration of vision-language models
(VLMs) has further enabled embedding models with instruction-following
capabilities. However, existing embedding models lack visual-interactive
capabilities to specify regions of interest from users (e.g., point, bounding
box, mask), which have been explored in generative models to broaden their
human-interactive applicability. Equipping embedding models with visual
interactions not only would unlock new applications with localized grounding of
user intent, which remains unexplored, but also enable the models to learn
entity-level information within images to complement their global
representations for conventional embedding tasks. In this paper, we propose a
novel Visual-InteRactive Text-Image Universal Embedder (VIRTUE) that extends
the capabilities of the segmentation model and the vision-language model to the
realm of representation learning. In VIRTUE, the segmentation model can process
visual prompts that pinpoint specific regions within an image, thereby enabling
the embedder to handle complex and ambiguous scenarios more precisely. To
evaluate the visual-interaction ability of VIRTUE, we introduce a large-scale
Segmentation-and-Scene Caption Retrieval (SCaR) benchmark comprising 1M samples
that aims to retrieve the text caption by jointly considering the entity with a
specific object and image scene. VIRTUE consistently achieves a
state-of-the-art performance with significant improvements across 36 universal
MMEB (3.1%-8.5%) and five visual-interactive SCaR (15.2%-20.3%) tasks.

TL;DR: 本研究为RAG系统开发了15个数据质量维度，分布在四个处理阶段，发现需要扩展传统DQ框架、采用前置质量管理策略，并建立动态的质量管理方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前数据质量框架主要针对静态数据集，无法充分应对RAG系统的动态多阶段特性，需要为这类AI系统开发专门的数据质量维度。

Method: 通过对16家领先IT服务公司从业者进行半结构化访谈，通过定性内容分析归纳得出RAG系统的数据质量维度。

Result: 识别出15个独特的DQ维度，分布在数据提取、数据转换、提示与搜索、生成四个处理阶段，发现新维度主要集中在早期阶段，且DQ问题会在管道中转化和传播。

Conclusion: 需要扩展传统DQ框架以覆盖RAG环境，采用前置质量管理策略，并建立动态的、步骤感知的质量管理方法。

Abstract: Organizations increasingly adopt Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to
enhance Large Language Models with enterprise-specific knowledge. However,
current data quality (DQ) frameworks have been primarily developed for static
datasets, and only inadequately address the dynamic, multi-stage nature of RAG
systems. This study aims to develop DQ dimensions for this new type of AI-based
systems. We conduct 16 semi-structured interviews with practitioners of leading
IT service companies. Through a qualitative content analysis, we inductively
derive 15 distinct DQ dimensions across the four processing stages of RAG
systems: data extraction, data transformation, prompt & search, and generation.
Our findings reveal that (1) new dimensions have to be added to traditional DQ
frameworks to also cover RAG contexts; (2) these new dimensions are
concentrated in early RAG steps, suggesting the need for front-loaded quality
management strategies, and (3) DQ issues transform and propagate through the
RAG pipeline, necessitating a dynamic, step-aware approach to quality
management.

<details>

Motivation: 扩散语言模型通过迭代去噪并行生成令牌，这种推理机制可能带来新的安全风险，特别是越狱攻击的威胁尚未被充分理解。

Method: 提出专门针对扩散语言模型的安全对齐方法，训练模型从包含肯定性令牌的污染中间状态生成安全响应。

Result: 实验表明该方法显著缓解了安全漏洞，对任务性能影响极小，并提高了对传统越狱攻击的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 扩散语言模型需要专门的安全研究，本文提出的方法有效解决了其特有的安全漏洞问题。

Abstract: Diffusion language models (DLMs) generate tokens in parallel through
iterative denoising, which can reduce latency and enable bidirectional
conditioning. However, the safety risks posed by jailbreak attacks that exploit
this inference mechanism are not well understood. In this paper, we reveal that
DLMs have a critical vulnerability stemming from their iterative denoising
process and propose a countermeasure. Specifically, our investigation shows
that if an affirmative token for a harmful query appears at an intermediate
step, subsequent denoising can be steered toward a harmful response even in
aligned models. As a result, simply injecting such affirmative tokens can
readily bypass the safety guardrails. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the
vulnerability allows existing optimization-based jailbreak attacks to succeed
on DLMs. Building on this analysis, we propose a novel safety alignment method
tailored to DLMs that trains models to generate safe responses from
contaminated intermediate states that contain affirmative tokens. Our
experiments indicate that the proposed method significantly mitigates the
vulnerability with minimal impact on task performance. Furthermore, our method
improves robustness against conventional jailbreak attacks. Our work
underscores the need for DLM-specific safety research.

TL;DR: ACON是一个统一的框架，通过优化压缩指南来压缩环境观察和交互历史，减少内存使用26-54%同时保持任务性能，并能蒸馏到更小模型中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM作为智能体在动态环境中部署时，需要积累长历史记录导致上下文长度增长，增加成本并降低长视野任务的效率，而现有的上下文压缩方法主要关注单步任务或狭窄应用。

Method: ACON框架通过自然语言空间中的压缩指南优化：当完整上下文成功但压缩上下文失败时，LLM分析失败原因并相应更新压缩指南，然后将优化的LLM压缩器蒸馏到更小模型中。

Result: 在AppWorld、OfficeBench和Multi-objective QA上的实验显示，ACON减少内存使用26-54%（峰值token），同时基本保持任务性能，蒸馏到更小压缩器时保持95%以上准确率，并将较小LM作为长视野智能体的性能提升达46%。

Conclusion: ACON有效解决了智能体任务中上下文长度增长的问题，通过优化压缩和蒸馏技术实现了高效的长视野任务处理。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed as agents in dynamic,
real-world environments, where success requires both reasoning and effective
tool use. A central challenge for agentic tasks is the growing context length,
as agents must accumulate long histories of actions and observations. This
expansion raises costs and reduces efficiency in long-horizon tasks, yet prior
work on context compression has mostly focused on single-step tasks or narrow
applications. We introduce Agent Context Optimization (ACON), a unified
framework that optimally compresses both environment observations and
interaction histories into concise yet informative condensations. ACON
leverages compression guideline optimization in natural language space: given
paired trajectories where full context succeeds but compressed context fails,
capable LLMs analyze the causes of failure, and the compression guideline is
updated accordingly. Furthermore, we propose distilling the optimized LLM
compressor into smaller models to reduce the overhead of the additional module.
Experiments on AppWorld, OfficeBench, and Multi-objective QA show that ACON
reduces memory usage by 26-54% (peak tokens) while largely preserving task
performance, preserves over 95% of accuracy when distilled into smaller
compressors, and enhances smaller LMs as long-horizon agents with up to 46%
performance improvement.

TL;DR: HARPA是一个AI驱动的科学发现系统，通过文献挖掘识别研究趋势、探索假设设计空间，并基于实验反馈学习奖励模型，生成可测试且基于文献的假设。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有自动化科学发现工具难以生成可测试且基于文献的假设，以及无法根据先前实验结果进行调整的问题。

Method: 采用受人类研究人员启发的构思流程：文献挖掘识别研究趋势、探索假设设计空间、通过确定研究差距和论证设计选择来收敛到精确可测试的假设，并学习基于先前实验结果的奖励模型。

Result: HARPA生成的研究提案在可行性(+0.78)和基础性(+0.85)方面显著优于基线；与ASD代理测试时，成功执行更多(20 vs 11)，失败更少(16 vs 21)；奖励模型比未训练基线提升约28%。

Conclusion: HARPA代表了AI驱动科学发现领域的重要进展，能够生成更可行、更基于文献的假设，并能根据实验反馈持续改进。

Abstract: While there has been a surge of interest in automated scientific discovery
(ASD), especially with the emergence of LLMs, it remains challenging for tools
to generate hypotheses that are both testable and grounded in the scientific
literature. Additionally, existing ideation tools are not adaptive to prior
experimental outcomes. We developed HARPA to address these challenges by
incorporating the ideation workflow inspired by human researchers. HARPA first
identifies emerging research trends through literature mining, then explores
hypothesis design spaces, and finally converges on precise, testable hypotheses
by pinpointing research gaps and justifying design choices. Our evaluations
show that HARPA-generated hypothesis-driven research proposals perform
comparably to a strong baseline AI-researcher across most qualitative
dimensions (e.g., specificity, novelty, overall quality), but achieve
significant gains in feasibility(+0.78, p$<0.05$, bootstrap) and groundedness
(+0.85, p$<0.01$, bootstrap) on a 10-point Likert scale. When tested with the
ASD agent (CodeScientist), HARPA produced more successful executions (20 vs. 11
out of 40) and fewer failures (16 vs. 21 out of 40), showing that expert
feasibility judgments track with actual execution success. Furthermore, to
simulate how researchers continuously refine their understanding of what
hypotheses are both testable and potentially interesting from experience, HARPA
learns a reward model that scores new hypotheses based on prior experimental
outcomes, achieving approx. a 28\% absolute gain over HARPA's untrained
baseline scorer. Together, these methods represent a step forward in the field
of AI-driven scientific discovery.

TL;DR: 该论文揭示了当前模型编辑方法存在严重缺陷，其表面上的成功实际上是基于利用隐藏捷径而非真实语义，在否定查询等简单测试下就会崩溃。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型不可避免地编码过时或不正确的知识，更新、删除和遗忘这些知识对于对齐、安全等问题很重要。模型编辑被提出作为解决方案，但作者发现其可靠性建立在脆弱基础上。

Method: 系统开发了一套新的评估方法，特别设计了否定查询等负例测试，来揭示模型编辑方法是否真正基于语义理解而非利用捷径。

Result: 研究发现最先进的模型编辑方法即使在最简单的否定查询下也会崩溃，表明编辑很可能基于捷径而非完整语义。

Conclusion: 模型编辑当前的基础存在根本性问题，需要在进一步推进之前重新考虑其基本前提，因为捷径与稳健的知识整合本质上是相悖的。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) inevitably encode outdated or incorrect
knowledge. Updating, deleting, and forgetting such knowledge is important for
alignment, safety, and other issues. To address this issue, model editing has
emerged as a promising paradigm: by precisely editing a small subset of
parameters such that a specific fact is updated while preserving other
knowledge. Despite its great success reported in previous papers, we find the
apparent reliability of editing rests on a fragile foundation and the current
literature is largely driven by illusory success. The fundamental goal of
steering the model's output toward a target with minimal modification would
encourage exploiting hidden shortcuts, rather than utilizing real semantics.
This problem directly challenges the feasibility of the current model editing
literature at its very foundation, as shortcuts are inherently at odds with
robust knowledge integration. Coincidentally, this issue has long been obscured
by evaluation frameworks that lack the design of negative examples. To uncover
it, we systematically develop a suite of new evaluation methods. Strikingly, we
find that state-of-the-art approaches collapse even under the simplest negation
queries. Our empirical evidence shows that editing is likely to be based on
shortcuts rather than full semantics, calling for an urgent reconsideration of
the very basis of model editing before further advancements can be meaningfully
pursued.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在概率轨迹预测中表现优异，但模型规模大、采样速度慢，难以在实际自动驾驶和智能交通系统中部署。需要开发轻量高效的实时预测方法。

Method: 基于协作渐进蒸馏(CPD)，逐步将知识从高性能教师扩散模型转移到轻量级学生模型，同时减少采样步数和模型规模。引入双信号正则化蒸馏损失，结合教师和真实数据指导。

Result: 在ETH-UCY行人基准和nuScenes车辆基准上达到最先进预测精度。蒸馏后的CDDM仅需231K参数和4/2采样步数，实现161倍压缩、31倍加速和9ms延迟，保持96.2% ADE和95.5% FDE性能。

Conclusion: CDDM成功将高性能生成模型与实用部署约束相结合，为自动驾驶和智能交通系统提供了资源高效的实时概率预测解决方案。

Abstract: Trajectory prediction is a fundamental task in Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) and
Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS), supporting efficient motion planning
and real-time traffic safety management. Diffusion models have recently
demonstrated strong performance in probabilistic trajectory prediction, but
their large model size and slow sampling process hinder real-world deployment.
This paper proposes Collaborative-Distilled Diffusion Models (CDDM), a novel
method for real-time and lightweight trajectory prediction. Built upon
Collaborative Progressive Distillation (CPD), CDDM progressively transfers
knowledge from a high-capacity teacher diffusion model to a lightweight student
model, jointly reducing both the number of sampling steps and the model size
across distillation iterations. A dual-signal regularized distillation loss is
further introduced to incorporate guidance from both the teacher and
ground-truth data, mitigating potential overfitting and ensuring robust
performance. Extensive experiments on the ETH-UCY pedestrian benchmark and the
nuScenes vehicle benchmark demonstrate that CDDM achieves state-of-the-art
prediction accuracy. The well-distilled CDDM retains 96.2% and 95.5% of the
baseline model's ADE and FDE performance on pedestrian trajectories, while
requiring only 231K parameters and 4 or 2 sampling steps, corresponding to 161x
compression, 31x acceleration, and 9 ms latency. Qualitative results further
show that CDDM generates diverse and accurate trajectories under dynamic agent
behaviors and complex social interactions. By bridging high-performing
generative models with practical deployment constraints, CDDM enables
resource-efficient probabilistic prediction for AVs and ITS. Code is available

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出Expected Attention方法，通过预测未来查询如何关注KV对来估计其重要性，实现无需训练的KV缓存压缩，解决了传统注意力分数剪枝方法面临的实际限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: KV缓存的显存消耗是大型语言模型推理效率的主要瓶颈。传统基于注意力分数的KV缓存剪枝方法面临实际限制：压缩时无法获得未来token的注意力分数，且现代实现如Flash Attention不生成完整注意力矩阵，无法访问过去分数。

Method: 引入Expected Attention方法，利用LLM激活的分布特性，以闭式形式计算每个KV对的期望注意力分数，从而对KV对进行排序和剪枝，最小化对残差流的影响。

Result: 该方法在预填充和解码阶段都能无缝运行，在两个场景中都持续优于最先进的基线方法。

Conclusion: 开发了KVPress库，包含20多种技术，使研究人员能够实现和基准测试KV缓存压缩方法。

Abstract: Memory consumption of the Key-Value (KV) cache represents a major bottleneck
for efficient large language model inference. While attention-score-based KV
cache pruning shows promise, it faces critical practical limitations: attention
scores from future tokens are unavailable during compression, and modern
implementations like Flash Attention do not materialize the full attention
matrix, making past scores inaccessible. To overcome these challenges, we
introduce $\textbf{Expected Attention, a training-free compression method}$
that estimates KV pairs importance by predicting how future queries will attend
to them. Our approach leverages the distributional properties of LLM
activations to compute expected attention scores in closed form for each KV
pair. These scores enable principled ranking and pruning of KV pairs with
minimal impact on the residual stream, achieving effective compression without
performance degradation. Importantly, our method operates seamlessly across
both prefilling and decoding phases, consistently outperforming
state-of-the-art baselines in both scenarios. Finally, $\textbf{we release
KVPress, a comprehensive library to enable researchers to implement and
benchmark KV cache compression methods, already including more than 20

Abstract: Understanding the inner workings of deep learning models is crucial for
advancing artificial intelligence, particularly in high-stakes fields such as
healthcare, where accurate explanations are as vital as precision. This paper
introduces Batch-CAM, a novel training paradigm that fuses a batch
implementation of the Grad-CAM algorithm with a prototypical reconstruction
loss. This combination guides the model to focus on salient image features,
thereby enhancing its performance across classification tasks. Our results
demonstrate that Batch-CAM achieves a simultaneous improvement in accuracy and
image reconstruction quality while reducing training and inference times. By
ensuring models learn from evidence-relevant information,this approach makes a
relevant contribution to building more transparent, explainable, and
trustworthy AI systems.

TL;DR: 提出一种迭代式相关区域缩减方法，通过逐步限制求解区域来获得更小的相关区域，从而提高策略重用效率和剪枝效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 游戏求解面临指数级增长的游戏树问题，现有相关区域方法虽然能缩小搜索空间，但不同解会产生不同大小的相关区域，较小的相关区域更有利于重用和剪枝效率。

Method: 设计迭代相关区域缩减方法，在重复求解同一位置时逐步限制参与区域；提出三种约束生成策略，并集成相关区域模式表以充分利用历史解。

Result: 在7x7 Killall-Go实验中，将平均相关区域大小缩减至原始的85.95%。

Conclusion: 缩减后的相关区域可作为可重用知识永久存储，特别适用于更大棋盘或不同开局情况的未来求解任务。

Abstract: Game solving aims to find the optimal strategies for all players and
determine the theoretical outcome of a game. However, due to the exponential
growth of game trees, many games remain unsolved, even though methods like
AlphaZero have demonstrated super-human level in game playing. The
Relevance-Zone (RZ) is a local strategy reuse technique that restricts the
search to only the regions relevant to the outcome, significantly reducing the
search space. However, RZs are not unique. Different solutions may result in
RZs of varying sizes. Smaller RZs are generally more favorable, as they
increase the chance of reuse and improve pruning efficiency. To this end, we
propose an iterative RZ reduction method that repeatedly solves the same
position while gradually restricting the region involved, guiding the solver
toward smaller RZs. We design three constraint generation strategies and
integrate an RZ Pattern Table to fully leverage past solutions. In experiments
on 7x7 Killall-Go, our method reduces the average RZ size to 85.95% of the
original. Furthermore, the reduced RZs can be permanently stored as reusable
knowledge for future solving tasks, especially for larger board sizes or
different openings.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了自适应课程策略优化（ACPO）框架，通过动态课程和自适应裁剪机制改进视觉语言模型的强化学习对齐，在多个多模态推理基准上实现SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有策略优化算法（如PPO）在视觉语言模型对齐中存在静态训练计划和刚性裁剪机制的限制，影响了复杂推理任务的性能。

Method: ACPO包含两个核心组件：动态课程学习（从稳定探索到高效利用的渐进过渡）和优势感知自适应裁剪（基于token优势值动态调整裁剪边界）。

Result: 在MathVista、LogicVista和MMMU-Pro等基准测试中，ACPO持续超越DAPO和PAPO等基线方法，实现了最先进的性能、更快的收敛速度和更好的训练稳定性。

Conclusion: ACPO通过自适应学习策略有效解决了现有RL算法的局限性，为复杂多模态推理任务提供了更优的对齐方案。

Abstract: Aligning large-scale vision-language models (VLMs) for complex reasoning via
reinforcement learning is often hampered by the limitations of existing policy
optimization algorithms, such as static training schedules and the rigid,
uniform clipping mechanism in Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO). In this work,
we introduce Adaptive Curriculum Policy Optimization (ACPO), a novel framework
that addresses these challenges through a dual-component adaptive learning
strategy. First, ACPO employs a dynamic curriculum that orchestrates a
principled transition from a stable, near on-policy exploration phase to an
efficient, off-policy exploitation phase by progressively increasing sample
reuse. Second, we propose an Advantage-Aware Adaptive Clipping (AAAC) mechanism
that replaces the fixed clipping hyperparameter with dynamic, sample-wise
bounds modulated by the normalized advantage of each token. This allows for
more granular and robust policy updates, enabling larger gradients for
high-potential samples while safeguarding against destructive ones. We conduct
extensive experiments on a suite of challenging multimodal reasoning
benchmarks, including MathVista, LogicVista, and MMMU-Pro. Results demonstrate
that ACPO consistently outperforms strong baselines such as DAPO and PAPO,
achieving state-of-the-art performance, accelerated convergence, and superior
training stability.

Motivation: 现有的大语言模型在形式定理证明中缺乏泛化能力，对问题表述的微小变化很脆弱，需要提升模型的鲁棒性。

Method: 从对称性角度提出EvolAST（基于抽象语法树的句法对称）和EvolDomain（跨数学领域的语义对称）方法；从难度角度提出EvolDifficulty方法；使用增强数据训练7B参数的EvolProver定理证明器。

Result: EvolProver在FormalMATH-Lite上达到53.8% pass@32，在MiniF2F-Test上达到69.8% pass@32，在Ineq-Comp-Seed和Ineq-Comp-Transformed上分别达到52.2%和34.0% pass@32，均创下非推理模型的新记录。

Conclusion: 提出的数据增强方法有效提升了定理证明模型的鲁棒性，EvolProver在多个基准测试中超越了同规模模型，包括推理模型。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) for formal theorem proving have shown
significant promise, yet they often lack generalizability and are fragile to
even minor transformations of problem statements. To address this limitation,
we introduce a novel data augmentation pipeline designed to enhance model
robustness from two perspectives: symmetry and difficulty. From the symmetry
perspective, we propose two complementary methods: EvolAST, an Abstract Syntax
Tree (AST) based approach that targets syntactic symmetry to generate
semantically equivalent problem variants, and EvolDomain, which leverages LLMs
to address semantic symmetry by translating theorems across mathematical
domains. From the difficulty perspective, we propose EvolDifficulty, which uses
carefully designed evolutionary instructions to guide LLMs in generating new
theorems with a wider range of difficulty. We then use the evolved data to
train EvolProver, a 7B-parameter non-reasoning theorem prover. EvolProver
establishes a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) on FormalMATH-Lite with a 53.8%
pass@32 rate, surpassing all models of comparable size, including
reasoning-based models. It also sets new SOTA records for non-reasoning models
on MiniF2F-Test (69.8% pass@32), Ineq-Comp-Seed (52.2% pass@32), and
Ineq-Comp-Transformed (34.0% pass@32). Ablation studies further confirm our
data augmentation pipeline's effectiveness across multiple benchmarks.

TL;DR: 本文提出DDIM反演攻击(DIA)方法，通过攻击DDIM轨迹路径来有效防御恶意AI图像编辑，性能优于现有防御方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DDIM反演技术使恶意用户能轻松合成虚假或侵权内容，现有防御方法因目标与去噪轨迹不匹配而效果有限。

Method: 提出DDIM反演攻击(DIA)，直接攻击DDIM的集成轨迹路径，而非单个步骤。

Result: DIA在多种编辑方法上均能有效破坏扩散过程，性能超越AdvDM和Photoguard等现有防御方法。

Conclusion: DIA框架为产业界和研究社区提供了实用的AI恶意使用防御方法。

Abstract: Diffusion models have shown to be strong representation learners, showcasing
state-of-the-art performance across multiple domains. Aside from accelerated
sampling, DDIM also enables the inversion of real images back to their latent
codes. A direct inheriting application of this inversion operation is real
image editing, where the inversion yields latent trajectories to be utilized
during the synthesis of the edited image. Unfortunately, this practical tool
has enabled malicious users to freely synthesize misinformative or deepfake
contents with greater ease, which promotes the spread of unethical and abusive,
as well as privacy-, and copyright-infringing contents. While defensive
algorithms such as AdvDM and Photoguard have been shown to disrupt the
diffusion process on these images, the misalignment between their objectives
and the iterative denoising trajectory at test time results in weak disruptive
performance.In this work, we present the DDIM Inversion Attack (DIA) that
attacks the integrated DDIM trajectory path. Our results support the effective
disruption, surpassing previous defensive methods across various editing
methods. We believe that our frameworks and results can provide practical
defense methods against the malicious use of AI for both the industry and the
research community. Our code is available here:

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 化学信息提取因数据异质性而具有挑战性，现有基于代理的方法在该领域表现有限，需要专门的评估资源。

Method: 创建了10个手动整理并经领域专家验证的数据集，进行了广泛的基准测试，比较了现有最先进的代理系统，并引入了单代理方法进行文档预处理控制。

Result: 实证发现化学信息提取仍存在持续挑战，特别是在处理领域特定术语、复杂表格和示意图表示以及上下文相关歧义方面。

Conclusion: ChemX基准为推进化学自动化信息提取提供了关键资源，挑战了现有方法的泛化能力，并为有效评估策略提供了宝贵见解。

Abstract: The emergence of agent-based systems represents a significant advancement in
artificial intelligence, with growing applications in automated data
extraction. However, chemical information extraction remains a formidable
challenge due to the inherent heterogeneity of chemical data. Current
agent-based approaches, both general-purpose and domain-specific, exhibit
limited performance in this domain. To address this gap, we present ChemX, a
comprehensive collection of 10 manually curated and domain-expert-validated
datasets focusing on nanomaterials and small molecules. These datasets are
designed to rigorously evaluate and enhance automated extraction methodologies
in chemistry. To demonstrate their utility, we conduct an extensive
benchmarking study comparing existing state-of-the-art agentic systems such as
ChatGPT Agent and chemical-specific data extraction agents. Additionally, we
introduce our own single-agent approach that enables precise control over
document preprocessing prior to extraction. We further evaluate the performance
of modern baselines, such as GPT-5 and GPT-5 Thinking, to compare their
capabilities with agentic approaches. Our empirical findings reveal persistent
challenges in chemical information extraction, particularly in processing
domain-specific terminology, complex tabular and schematic representations, and
context-dependent ambiguities. The ChemX benchmark serves as a critical
resource for advancing automated information extraction in chemistry,
challenging the generalization capabilities of existing methods, and providing
valuable insights into effective evaluation strategies.

Motivation: 比较两种处理不一致知识库的形式化方法：加权知识库的成本语义和c-representations，探索它们之间的语义等价性。

Method: 通过语义层面的比较分析，研究两种方法在解释排序和蕴含关系方面的等价条件。

Result: 在特定条件下，加权知识库和可废止条件集可以生成相同的解释排序，两种形式化方法在语义结构上具有等价性。

Conclusion: 两种方法在语义层面存在等价关系，这一发现有助于进一步推动成本语义和c-representations的研究发展。

Abstract: Weighted-knowledge bases and cost-based semantics represent a recent
formalism introduced by Bienvenu et al. for Ontology Mediated Data Querying in
the case where a given knowledge base is inconsistent. This is done by adding a
weight to each statement in the knowledge base (KB), and then giving each DL
interpretation a cost based on how often it breaks rules in the KB. In this
paper we compare this approach with c-representations, a form of non-monotonic
reasoning originally introduced by Kern-Isberner. c-Representations describe a
means to interpret defeasible concept inclusions in the first-order case. This
is done by assigning a numerical ranking to each interpretations via penalties
for each violated conditional. We compare these two approaches on a semantic
level. In particular, we show that under certain conditions a weighted
knowledge base and a set of defeasible conditionals can generate the same
ordering on interpretations, and therefore an equivalence of semantic
structures up to relative cost. Moreover, we compare entailment described in
both cases, where certain notions are equivalently expressible in both
formalisms. Our results have the potential to benefit further work on both
cost-based semantics and c-representations

Motivation: 探索分类器之间一致性与分歧在评估中的不对称效用，当专家意见一致时无法排除任何可能的评估结果，而当意见分歧时则能确定至少一方不正确。

Method: 将分类器的对齐决策统计摘要作为输入，构建整数空间中的线性规划问题，包含逻辑约束（如正确响应数不能超过观察响应数）和适用于所有有限测试的通用线性等式公理。

Result: 开发了仅基于逻辑一致性的无监督评估方法，能够计算与观察到的同意和分歧模式逻辑一致的群体评估集合。

Conclusion: 该方法具有实际和即时效用，能够构建无需知识的警报系统来检测LLM评委是否违反用户设定的最低评分标准。

Abstract: If two experts disagree on a test, we may conclude both cannot be 100 per
cent correct. But if they completely agree, no possible evaluation can be
excluded. This asymmetry in the utility of agreements versus disagreements is
explored here by formalizing a logic of unsupervised evaluation for
classifiers. Its core problem is computing the set of group evaluations that
are logically consistent with how we observe them agreeing and disagreeing in
their decisions. Statistical summaries of their aligned decisions are inputs
into a Linear Programming problem in the integer space of possible correct or
incorrect responses given true labels. Obvious logical constraints, such as,
the number of correct responses cannot exceed the number of observed responses,
are inequalities. But in addition, there are axioms, universally applicable
linear equalities that apply to all finite tests. The practical and immediate
utility of this approach to unsupervised evaluation using only logical
consistency is demonstrated by building no-knowledge alarms that can detect
when one or more LLMs-as-Judges are violating a minimum grading threshold
specified by the user.

Abstract: The increasing integration of distributed energy resources (DERs),
particularly renewables, poses significant challenges for power system
protection, with fault classification (FC) and fault localization (FL) being
among the most critical tasks. Conventional protection schemes, based on fixed
thresholds, cannot reliably identify and localize short circuits with the
increasing complexity of the grid under dynamic conditions. Machine learning
(ML) offers a promising alternative; however, systematic benchmarks across
models and settings remain limited. This work presents, for the first time, a
comparative benchmarking study of classical ML models for FC and FL in power
system protection based on EMT data. Using voltage and current waveforms
segmented into sliding windows of 10 ms to 50 ms, we evaluate models under
realistic real-time constraints. Performance is assessed in terms of accuracy,
robustness to window size, and runtime efficiency. The best-performing FC model
achieved an F1 score of 0.992$\pm$0.001, while the top FL model reached an R2
of 0.806$\pm$0.008 with a mean processing time of 0.563 ms.

Conclusion: 将数据平衡技术与集成方法相结合，可显著改善操纵活动的早期检测，有助于建立更公平、透明和稳定的加密货币市场。

Abstract: This study aims to detect pump and dump (P&D) manipulation in cryptocurrency
markets, where the scarcity of such events causes severe class imbalance and
hinders accurate detection. To address this issue, the Synthetic Minority
Oversampling Technique (SMOTE) was applied, and advanced ensemble learning
models were evaluated to distinguish manipulative trading behavior from normal
market activity. The experimental results show that applying SMOTE greatly
enhanced the ability of all models to detect P&D events by increasing recall
and improving the overall balance between precision and recall. In particular,
XGBoost and LightGBM achieved high recall rates (94.87% and 93.59%,
respectively) with strong F1-scores and demonstrated fast computational
performance, making them suitable for near real time surveillance. These
findings indicate that integrating data balancing techniques with ensemble
methods significantly improves the early detection of manipulative activities,
contributing to a fairer, more transparent, and more stable cryptocurrency
market.

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed a surge in the number of large language models
(LLMs), yet efficiently managing and utilizing these vast resources remains a
significant challenge. In this work, we explore how to learn compact
representations of LLM abilities that can facilitate downstream tasks, such as
model routing and performance prediction on new benchmarks. We frame this
problem as estimating the probability that a given model will correctly answer
a specific query. Inspired by the item response theory (IRT) in psychometrics,
we model this probability as a function of three key factors: (i) the model's
multi-skill ability vector, (2) the query's discrimination vector that
separates models of differing skills, and (3) the query's difficulty scalar. To
learn these parameters jointly, we introduce a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) network
that couples model- and query-level embeddings. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our approach leads to state-of-the-art performance in both
model routing and benchmark accuracy prediction. Moreover, analysis validates
that the learned parameters encode meaningful, interpretable information about
model capabilities and query characteristics.

Abstract: Organizations are increasingly focused on leveraging data from their
processes to gain insights and drive decision-making. However, converting this
data into actionable knowledge remains a difficult and time-consuming task.
There is often a gap between the volume of data collected and the ability to
process and understand it, which automated knowledge discovery aims to fill.
Automated knowledge discovery involves complex open problems, including
effectively navigating data, building models to extract implicit relationships,
and considering subjective goals and knowledge. In this paper, we introduce a
novel method for Automated Insights and Data Exploration (AIDE), that serves as
a robust foundation for tackling these challenges through the use of Monte
Carlo Tree Search (MCTS). We evaluate AIDE using both real-world and synthetic
data, demonstrating its effectiveness in identifying data transformations and
models that uncover interesting data patterns. Among its strengths, AIDE's
MCTS-based framework offers significant extensibility, allowing for future
integration of additional pattern extraction strategies and domain knowledge.
This makes AIDE a valuable step towards developing a comprehensive solution for
automated knowledge discovery.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MMKG方法主要将不同模态对齐到共享空间，忽视了特定模态的独特贡献，在低资源设置下性能受限。

Method: 提出FusionAdapter，包含：(1)适配器模块使每个模态能有效适应未见关系；(2)融合策略在整合多模态实体表示时保留模态特定特征。

Result: 在两个基准MMKG数据集上的实验表明，FusionAdapter在少样本关系学习任务上优于最先进方法。

Conclusion: 通过有效适应和融合多模态信息，FusionAdapter能以最小监督提高对新关系的泛化能力。

Abstract: Multimodal Knowledge Graphs (MMKGs) incorporate various modalities, including
text and images, to enhance entity and relation representations. Notably,
different modalities for the same entity often present complementary and
diverse information. However, existing MMKG methods primarily align modalities
into a shared space, which tends to overlook the distinct contributions of
specific modalities, limiting their performance particularly in low-resource
settings. To address this challenge, we propose FusionAdapter for the learning
of few-shot relationships (FSRL) in MMKG. FusionAdapter introduces (1) an
adapter module that enables efficient adaptation of each modality to unseen
relations and (2) a fusion strategy that integrates multimodal entity
representations while preserving diverse modality-specific characteristics. By
effectively adapting and fusing information from diverse modalities,
FusionAdapter improves generalization to novel relations with minimal
supervision. Extensive experiments on two benchmark MMKG datasets demonstrate
that FusionAdapter achieves superior performance over state-of-the-art methods.

Motivation: 对抗模仿学习(AIL)方法虽然有效但不够稳定。现有研究主要关注密度比估计，而奖励分配函数的作用被忽视，通常依赖人工设计。本文旨在探索基于模仿策略性能的数据驱动奖励分配函数。

Method: 采用LLM引导的进化框架，在奖励分配函数空间中进行高效探索，开发出首个元学习的AIL算法DAIL。

Result: DAIL在未见过的环境和策略优化算法上表现出良好的泛化能力，超越了当前最先进的人工设计基线方法。

Conclusion: DAIL通过自动发现的奖励分配函数实现了更稳定的训练，为理解奖励分配函数在AIL稳定性中的作用提供了新的见解。

Abstract: Adversarial Imitation Learning (AIL) methods, while effective in settings
with limited expert demonstrations, are often considered unstable. These
approaches typically decompose into two components: Density Ratio (DR)
estimation $\frac{\rho_E}{\rho_{\pi}}$, where a discriminator estimates the
relative occupancy of state-action pairs under the policy versus the expert;
and Reward Assignment (RA), where this ratio is transformed into a reward
signal used to train the policy. While significant research has focused on
improving density estimation, the role of reward assignment in influencing
training dynamics and final policy performance has been largely overlooked. RA
functions in AIL are typically derived from divergence minimization objectives,
relying heavily on human design and ingenuity. In this work, we take a
different approach: we investigate the discovery of data-driven RA functions,
i.e, based directly on the performance of the resulting imitation policy. To
this end, we leverage an LLM-guided evolutionary framework that efficiently
explores the space of RA functions, yielding \emph{Discovered Adversarial
Imitation Learning} (DAIL), the first meta-learnt AIL algorithm. Remarkably,
DAIL generalises across unseen environments and policy optimization algorithms,
outperforming the current state-of-the-art of \emph{human-designed} baselines.
Finally, we analyse why DAIL leads to more stable training, offering novel
insights into the role of RA functions in the stability of AIL. Code is

Method: 1. 在图粗化过程中引入随机边选择替代贪心方法；2. 提出GraphCHiP算法，利用粗化历史识别RCIs和FCIs。

Result: 在随机生成的CVRP实例上，该方法相比现有神经分离方法能更有效地减少对偶间隙，并在特定实例上发现了有效的FCIs。

Conclusion: 通过测试时随机搜索和GraphCHiP算法，能够增强训练模型的性能，生成更多样化的有效切割，包括具有挑战性的FCIs。

Abstract: The identification of valid inequalities, such as the rounded capacity
inequalities (RCIs), is a key component of cutting plane methods for the
Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP). While a deep learning-based
separation method can learn to find high-quality cuts, our analysis reveals
that the model produces fewer cuts than expected because it is insufficiently
sensitive to generate a diverse set of generated subsets. This paper proposes
an alternative: enhancing the performance of a trained model at inference time
through a new test-time search with stochasticity. First, we introduce
stochastic edge selection into the graph coarsening procedure, replacing the
previously proposed greedy approach. Second, we propose the Graph Coarsening
History-based Partitioning (GraphCHiP) algorithm, which leverages coarsening
history to identify not only RCIs but also, for the first time, the Framed
capacity inequalities (FCIs). Experiments on randomly generated CVRP instances
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in reducing the dual gap compared
to the existing neural separation method. Additionally, our method discovers
effective FCIs on a specific instance, despite the challenging nature of
identifying such cuts.

Abstract: In the complex landscape of multivariate time series forecasting, achieving
both accuracy and interpretability remains a significant challenge. This paper
introduces the Fuzzy Transformer (Fuzzformer), a novel recurrent neural network
architecture combined with multi-head self-attention and fuzzy inference
systems to analyze multivariate stock market data and conduct long-term time
series forecasting. The method leverages LSTM networks and temporal attention
to condense multivariate data into interpretable features suitable for fuzzy
inference systems. The resulting architecture offers comparable forecasting
performance to conventional models such as ARIMA and LSTM while providing
meaningful information flow within the network. The method was examined on the
real world stock market index S\&P500. Initial results show potential for
interpretable forecasting and identify current performance tradeoffs,
suggesting practical application in understanding and forecasting stock market
behavior.

TL;DR: QUASAR是一个基于工具增强大语言模型的强化学习框架，用于生成和优化量子电路，解决了参数化量子门需要精确数值和LLM缺乏量子领域知识的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM生成的量子电路质量低且不正确，因为缺乏量子领域特定知识，且参数化量子门需要精确数值来优化性能。

Method: 设计了量子电路验证方法和分层奖励机制的强化学习训练框架，结合外部量子模拟器来对齐LLM的量子知识。

Result: 在4B参数LLM上实现了99.31%的Pass@1有效性和100%的Pass@10有效性，超越了GPT-4o、GPT-5等工业级LLM和多个基线方法。

Conclusion: QUASAR框架显著提高了生成量子电路的语法和语义性能，证明了工具增强LLM在量子计算领域的有效性。

Abstract: Designing and optimizing task-specific quantum circuits are crucial to
leverage the advantage of quantum computing. Recent large language model
(LLM)-based quantum circuit generation has emerged as a promising automatic
solution. However, the fundamental challenges remain unaddressed: (i)
parameterized quantum gates require precise numerical values for optimal
performance, which also depend on multiple aspects, including the number of
quantum gates, their parameters, and the layout/depth of the circuits. (ii)
LLMs often generate low-quality or incorrect quantum circuits due to the lack
of quantum domain-specific knowledge. We propose QUASAR, an agentic
reinforcement learning (RL) framework for quantum circuits generation and
optimization based on tool-augmented LLMs. To align the LLM with
quantum-specific knowledge and improve the generated quantum circuits, QUASAR
designs (i) a quantum circuit verification approach with external quantum
simulators and (ii) a sophisticated hierarchical reward mechanism in RL
training. Extensive evaluation shows improvements in both syntax and semantic
performance of the generated quantum circuits. When augmenting a 4B LLM, QUASAR
has achieved the validity of 99.31% in Pass@1 and 100% in Pass@10,
outperforming industrial LLMs of GPT-4o, GPT-5 and DeepSeek-V3 and several
supervised-fine-tuning (SFT)-only and RL-only baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 罕见病诊断面临数据稀缺、隐私担忧和边缘设备资源有限等挑战，需要一种能同时处理这些问题的集成解决方案。

Method: 结合三个核心组件：基于元学习的少样本联邦优化、能量感知客户端调度机制、以及带校准差分隐私的安全聚合。

Result: 在模拟罕见病检测数据集上，相比基线联邦学习准确率提升10%，客户端掉线率降低50%以上，隐私-效用权衡在临床可接受范围内。

Conclusion: AFFR为罕见病的公平可信联邦诊断提供了一条实用路径，能够部署在真实临床网络中。

Abstract: Rare-disease diagnosis remains one of the most pressing challenges in digital
health, hindered by extreme data scarcity, privacy concerns, and the limited
resources of edge devices. This paper proposes the Adaptive Federated Few-Shot
Rare-Disease Diagnosis (AFFR) framework, which integrates three pillars: (i)
few-shot federated optimization with meta-learning to generalize from limited
patient samples, (ii) energy-aware client scheduling to mitigate device
dropouts and ensure balanced participation, and (iii) secure aggregation with
calibrated differential privacy to safeguard sensitive model updates. Unlike
prior work that addresses these aspects in isolation, AFFR unifies them into a
modular pipeline deployable on real-world clinical networks. Experimental
evaluation on simulated rare-disease detection datasets demonstrates up to 10%
improvement in accuracy compared with baseline FL, while reducing client
dropouts by over 50% without degrading convergence. Furthermore,
privacy-utility trade-offs remain within clinically acceptable bounds. These
findings highlight AFFR as a practical pathway for equitable and trustworthy
federated diagnosis of rare conditions.

Motivation: 解决售后需求预测中的复杂性，包括外生信号、COVID-19影响、高收入项目与长尾项目的不同处理需求，以及为规划者和高管提供可操作的业务洞察。

Method: 使用收入感知和聚类感知的模型集成，处理外生信号（安装基数、定价、宏观指标等），将COVID-19作为独立制度，采用帕累托感知分割和水平感知集成，并嵌入LLM生成角色化叙述。

Result: 系统能够生成国家-零件级别的预测，提供校准区间，通过性能记分卡提供决策洞察，包括准确性阈值、偏差分解、地理和产品系列热点，以及趋势模块跟踪MAPE/WMAPE和偏差的变化。

Abstract: This paper presents a practical architecture for after-sales demand
forecasting and monitoring that unifies a revenue- and cluster-aware ensemble
of statistical, machine-learning, and deep-learning models with a role-driven
analytics layer for scorecards and trend diagnostics. The framework ingests
exogenous signals (installed base, pricing, macro indicators, life cycle,
seasonality) and treats COVID-19 as a distinct regime, producing country-part
forecasts with calibrated intervals. A Pareto-aware segmentation forecasts
high-revenue items individually and pools the long tail via clusters, while
horizon-aware ensembling aligns weights with business-relevant losses (e.g.,
WMAPE). Beyond forecasts, a performance scorecard delivers decision-focused
insights: accuracy within tolerance thresholds by revenue share and count, bias
decomposition (over- vs under-forecast), geographic and product-family
hotspots, and ranked root causes tied to high-impact part-country pairs. A
trend module tracks trajectories of MAPE/WMAPE and bias across recent months,
flags entities that are improving or deteriorating, detects change points
aligned with known regimes, and attributes movements to lifecycle and seasonal
factors. LLMs are embedded in the analytics layer to generate role-aware
narratives and enforce reporting contracts. They standardize business
definitions, automate quality checks and reconciliations, and translate
quantitative results into concise, explainable summaries for planners and
executives. The system exposes a reproducible workflow -- request
specification, model execution, database-backed artifacts, and AI-generated
narratives -- so planners can move from "How accurate are we now?" to "Where is
accuracy heading and which levers should we pull?", closing the loop between
forecasting, monitoring, and inventory decisions across more than 90 countries
and about 6,000 parts.

Motivation: 先前研究专注于发现特定特征的特定几何结构，缺乏通用性。需要一种模型无关的方法来自动发现特征流形。

Method: 引入监督多维缩放（SMDS）方法，以时间推理为案例研究，自动发现特征流形。

Result: 发现不同特征形成各种几何结构，这些结构反映概念属性、跨模型稳定、支持推理，并随上下文动态重塑。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了特征流形的功能作用，支持基于实体的推理模型，表明语言模型编码和转换结构化表示。

Abstract: The linear representation hypothesis states that language models (LMs) encode
concepts as directions in their latent space, forming organized,
multidimensional manifolds. Prior efforts focus on discovering specific
geometries for specific features, and thus lack generalization. We introduce
Supervised Multi-Dimensional Scaling (SMDS), a model-agnostic method to
automatically discover feature manifolds. We apply SMDS to temporal reasoning
as a case study, finding that different features form various geometric
structures such as circles, lines, and clusters. SMDS reveals many insights on
these structures: they consistently reflect the properties of the concepts they
represent; are stable across model families and sizes; actively support
reasoning in models; and dynamically reshape in response to context changes.
Together, our findings shed light on the functional role of feature manifolds,
supporting a model of entity-based reasoning in which LMs encode and transform
structured representations.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该研究评估了70多个不同架构的大语言模型在概念表示上与人类的对齐程度，发现指令微调和注意力头维度是影响对齐的关键因素，而多模态预训练和参数大小影响有限。现有基准测试无法充分衡量人机表示对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型在计算成分（架构、微调方法、训练数据等）上存在多样性，但尚不清楚哪些成分对构建具有人类类似表示的模型最为关键。现有LLM基准测试不适合衡量人类与模型之间的表示对齐。

Method: 使用认知科学中成熟的三元组相似性任务，基于THINGS数据库的概念，评估了70多个在计算成分上广泛变化的模型，比较人类和模型的概念表示。

Result: 发现经过指令微调的模型和具有较大注意力头维度的模型与人类表示最为对齐，而多模态预训练和参数大小对对齐影响有限。现有基准测试中，MMLU比MUSR更适合捕捉表示对齐，但没有一个基准能完全解释对齐分数的方差。

Conclusion: 指令微调和注意力头维度是推进LLMs成为人类概念表示模型的最关键计算成分，同时解决了LLM评估中的关键基准测试差距。

Abstract: The ability to translate diverse patterns of inputs into structured patterns
of behavior has been thought to rest on both humans' and machines' ability to
learn robust representations of relevant concepts. The rapid advancement of
transformer-based large language models (LLMs) has led to a diversity of
computational ingredients -- architectures, fine tuning methods, and training
datasets among others -- but it remains unclear which of these ingredients are
most crucial for building models that develop human-like representations.
Further, most current LLM benchmarks are not suited to measuring
representational alignment between humans and models, making benchmark scores
unreliable for assessing if current LLMs are making progress towards becoming
useful cognitive models. We address these limitations by first evaluating a set
of over 70 models that widely vary in their computational ingredients on a
triplet similarity task, a method well established in the cognitive sciences
for measuring human conceptual representations, using concepts from the THINGS
database. Comparing human and model representations, we find that models that
undergo instruction-finetuning and which have larger dimensionality of
attention heads are among the most human aligned, while multimodal pretraining
and parameter size have limited bearing on alignment. Correlations between
alignment scores and scores on existing benchmarks reveal that while some
benchmarks (e.g., MMLU) are better suited than others (e.g., MUSR) for
capturing representational alignment, no existing benchmark is capable of fully
accounting for the variance of alignment scores, demonstrating their
insufficiency in capturing human-AI alignment. Taken together, our findings
help highlight the computational ingredients most essential for advancing LLMs
towards models of human conceptual representation and address a key
benchmarking gap in LLM evaluation.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的前向传播范式Activation-Deactivation (AD)，通过关闭模型中与遮挡部分对应的组件来消除遮挡输入特征对模型决策的影响，解决了传统黑盒解释方法因遮挡导致分布外图像的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统黑盒解释方法依赖遮挡输入部分生成突变体，导致分布外图像，影响解释质量，且选择合适遮挡值需要领域知识。

Method: 引入ConvAD机制，可轻松添加到任何训练好的CNN中，实现AD范式，无需额外训练或微调。

Result: 实验表明AD解释在多个数据集和模型架构上相比遮挡方法，鲁棒性提升高达62.5%，且无需领域知识。

Conclusion: ConvAD能够提取更鲁棒的解释，不改变网络决策过程，解决了传统遮挡方法的局限性。

Abstract: Black-box explainability methods are popular tools for explaining the
decisions of image classifiers. A major drawback of these tools is their
reliance on mutants obtained by occluding parts of the input, leading to
out-of-distribution images. This raises doubts about the quality of the
explanations. Moreover, choosing an appropriate occlusion value often requires
domain knowledge. In this paper we introduce a novel forward-pass paradigm
Activation-Deactivation (AD), which removes the effects of occluded input
features from the model's decision-making by switching off the parts of the
model that correspond to the occlusions. We introduce ConvAD, a drop-in
mechanism that can be easily added to any trained Convolutional Neural Network
(CNN), and which implements the AD paradigm. This leads to more robust
explanations without any additional training or fine-tuning. We prove that the
ConvAD mechanism does not change the decision-making process of the network. We
provide experimental evaluation across several datasets and model
architectures. We compare the quality of AD-explanations with explanations
achieved using a set of masking values, using the proxies of robustness, size,
and confidence drop-off. We observe a consistent improvement in robustness of
AD explanations (up to 62.5%) compared to explanations obtained with
occlusions, demonstrating that ConvAD extracts more robust explanations without
the need for domain knowledge.

Result: 成功将CoT轨迹转换为良好类型化证明，为推理忠实性提供可验证证书。

Conclusion: 该框架为构建更可靠和可信赖的AI系统提供了一条路径，将叙述性解释转化为可形式验证的程序。

Abstract: While Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting enhances the reasoning capabilities of
large language models, the faithfulness of the generated rationales remains an
open problem for model interpretability. We propose a novel theoretical lens
for this problem grounded in the Curry-Howard correspondence, which posits a
direct relationship between formal proofs and computer programs. Under this
paradigm, a faithful reasoning trace is analogous to a well-typed program,
where each intermediate step corresponds to a typed logical inference. We
operationalise this analogy, presenting methods to extract and map the
informal, natural language steps of CoT into a formal, typed proof structure.
Successfully converting a CoT trace into a well-typed proof serves as a strong,
verifiable certificate of its computational faithfulness, moving beyond
heuristic interpretability towards formal verification. Our framework provides
a methodology to transform plausible narrative explanations into formally
verifiable programs, offering a path towards building more reliable and
trustworthy AI systems.

Motivation: 由于缺乏通用标准和可靠的内容验证器，难以获得有效的训练信号来确保LLM安全

Method: SIRL方法将模型内部的安全置信度转化为自生成的奖励信号，通过强化低熵拒绝行为来教导模型信任其安全本能

Result: 在Llama和Qwen模型上评估，SIRL对20+种越狱方法保持89%+的防御成功率，仅使用15,000个未标记提示就超越资源密集的监督方法

Conclusion: 有效的对齐可以从模型内部产生，为无需大量人工监督的自主、鲁棒AI安全机制铺平道路

Abstract: Ensuring Large Language Model (LLM) safety remains challenging due to the
absence of universal standards and reliable content validators, making it
difficult to obtain effective training signals. We discover that aligned models
already possess robust internal safety beliefs: they consistently produce
high-confidence refusals to harmful requests while exhibiting high entropy when
generating potentially dangerous content. This entropy gap reveals an untapped
signal--models intrinsically "know" when to refuse. We introduce Safety
Instincts Reinforcement Learning (SIRL), which transforms this internal
confidence into a self-generated reward signal, eliminating dependence on
external validators or human annotations. SIRL teaches models to trust their
safety instincts by reinforcing low-entropy refusal behaviors. Evaluated on
Llama and Qwen models, SIRL maintains 89%+ Defense Success Rates (DSRs) against
20+ jailbreak methods, from static prompts to adaptive attacks. Using only
15,000 unlabeled prompts, SIRL surpasses resource-intensive supervised methods
while preserving performance on mathematics, coding, and conversation
benchmarks. Our work demonstrates that effective alignment can emerge from
within, paving the way for more autonomous and robust AI safety mechanisms that
scale without extensive human oversight.

Motivation: 在工业制造中同时优化运营效率和劳动力公平性，将人的因素（如工人偏好、经验、韧性）整合到生产规划中

Method: 第一层使用约束规划(CP)进行订单-产线分配，第二层使用马尔可夫决策过程(MDP)进行工人-产线分配，比较了贪婪分配、MCTS和RL三种策略

Conclusion: 结合CP和学习型决策为人本生产规划提供了稳健方法，能够同时优化吞吐量和员工福祉

Abstract: This work presents a two-layer, human-centric production planning framework
designed to optimize both operational efficiency and workforce fairness in
industrial manufacturing. The first layer formulates the Order-Line allocation
as a Constraint Programming (CP) problem, generating high-utilization
production schedules that respect machine capacities, processing times, and due
dates. The second layer models Worker-Line allocation as a Markov Decision
Process (MDP), integrating human factors such as worker preference, experience,
resilience, and medical constraints into the assignment process. Three solution
strategies, greedy allocation, MCTS, and RL, are implemented and compared
across multiple evaluation scenarios. The proposed system is validated through
16 test sessions with domain experts from the automotive industry, combining
quantitative key performance indicators (KPIs) with expert ratings. Results
indicate that the CP-based scheduling approach produces compact, feasible
production plans with low tardiness, while the MDP-based worker allocation
significantly improves fairness and preference alignment compared to baseline
approaches. Domain experts rated both the Order-Line and Worker-Line components
as effective and highlighted opportunities to further refine the objective
function to penalize excessive earliness and improve continuity in worker
assignments. Overall, the findings demonstrate that combining CP with
learning-based decision-making provides a robust approach for human-centric
production planning. The approach enables simultaneous optimization of
throughput and workforce well-being, offering a practical foundation for fair
and efficient manufacturing scheduling in industrial settings.

Abstract: We present PRISM-Consult, a clinician-aligned panel-of-experts architecture
that extends the compact PRISM sequence model into a routed family of domain
specialists. Episodes are tokenized as structured clinical events; a
light-weight router reads the first few tokens and dispatches to specialist
models (Cardiac-Vascular, Pulmonary, Gastro-Oesophageal, Musculoskeletal,
Psychogenic). Each specialist inherits PRISM's small transformer backbone and
token template, enabling parameter efficiency and interpretability. On
real-world Emergency Department cohorts, specialists exhibit smooth convergence
with low development perplexities across domains, while the router achieves
high routing quality and large compute savings versus consult-all under a
safety-first policy. We detail the data methodology (initial vs. conclusive
ICD-9 families), routing thresholds and calibration, and report per-domain
results to avoid dominance by common events. The framework provides a practical
path to safe, auditable, and low-latency consult at scale, and we outline
validation steps-external/temporal replication, asymmetric life-threat
thresholds, and multi-label arbitration-to meet prospective clinical deployment
standards.

Conclusion: 通过利用网络与知识图谱的二元性，该框架成功解决了LLM在金融风险分析中的局限性，提供了一种高效、可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle with the complex, multi-modal, and
network-native data underlying financial risk. Standard Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) oversimplifies relationships, while specialist models are
costly and static. We address this gap with an LLM-centric agent framework for
supply chain risk analysis. Our core contribution is to exploit the inherent
duality between networks and knowledge graphs (KG). We treat the supply chain
network as a KG, allowing us to use structural network science principles for
retrieval. A graph traverser, guided by network centrality scores, efficiently
extracts the most economically salient risk paths. An agentic architecture
orchestrates this graph retrieval alongside data from numerical factor tables
and news streams. Crucially, it employs novel ``context shells'' -- descriptive
templates that embed raw figures in natural language -- to make quantitative
data fully intelligible to the LLM. This lightweight approach enables the model
to generate concise, explainable, and context-rich risk narratives in real-time
without costly fine-tuning or a dedicated graph database.

Abstract: We present Apriel-1.5-15B-Thinker, a 15-billion parameter open-weights
multimodal reasoning model that achieves frontier-level performance through
training design rather than sheer scale. Starting from Pixtral-12B, we apply a
progressive three-stage methodology: (1) depth upscaling to expand reasoning
capacity without pretraining from scratch, (2) staged continual pre-training
that first develops foundational text and vision understanding, then enhances
visual reasoning through targeted synthetic data generation addressing spatial
structure, compositional understanding, and fine-grained perception, and (3)
high-quality text-only supervised fine-tuning on curated instruction-response
pairs with explicit reasoning traces spanning mathematics, coding, science, and

operating within single-GPU deployment constraints. Our results demonstrate
that thoughtful mid-training 2 design can close substantial capability gaps
without massive scale, making frontier-level multimodal reasoning accessible to
organizations with limited infrastructure. We release the model checkpoint, all
training recipes, and evaluation protocols under the MIT license to to advance
open-source research.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统并行LLM推理中，多个响应独立生成，浪费了响应间的潜在有用信息，无法像序列长度扩展那样利用过去计算。

Method: 将批处理LLM隐藏状态重新视为整体张量而非独立切片，通过少量新参数（2.8%-5.1%）实现响应间的相互依赖。

Result: Bridge将可验证奖励强化学习的相对平均准确率提升高达50%，提高了正确响应的一致性，且一次训练即可扩展到任意生成宽度。

Conclusion: Bridge解锁了更通用的并行扩展模式，有效利用序列间信息，兼容任何后生成聚合技术，性能优于独立生成。

Abstract: Parallel LLM inference scaling involves sampling a set of $N>1$ responses for
a single input prompt. However, these $N$ parallel responses tend to be
generated independently from each other, partitioning compute resources and
leaving potentially useful information in one generation untapped by others.
This is in contrast to response length scaling where past computation is used
in all future steps. For higher quality responses and response sets, we propose
Bridge to generate interdependent responses in parallel by rethinking batched
LLM hidden states as holistic tensors rather than independent slices. With only
a small amount (2.8%-5.1%) of new parameters, Bridge improves the relative mean
accuracy gains from reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards by up to 50%
and boosts consistency of correct responses. Trained once, Bridge scales to any
generation width, all with greater performance than independent generations,
unlocking a more general mode of parallel scaling that effectively leverages
information between sequences, compatible with any post-generation aggregation
technique.
