### [1] [DrivingScene: A Multi-Task Online Feed-Forward 3D Gaussian Splatting Method for Dynamic Driving Scenes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24734)
*Qirui Hou,Wenzhang Sun,Chang Zeng,Chunfeng Wang,Hao Li,Jianxun Cui*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DrivingScene是一个从两帧连续环视图像在线重建4D动态驾驶场景的框架，通过轻量级残差流网络预测动态物体的非刚性运动，在nuScenes数据集上显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实时高保真重建动态驾驶场景面临复杂动态和稀疏视图的挑战，现有方法难以平衡质量和效率。

Method: 提出轻量级残差流网络，在学习的静态场景先验基础上预测每相机动态物体的非刚性运动，通过场景流显式建模动态；采用粗到精的训练范式避免端到端方法的不稳定性。

Result: 在nuScenes数据集上，仅使用图像的方法能同时在线生成高质量深度、场景流和3D高斯点云，在动态重建和新视角合成方面显著优于最先进方法。

Conclusion: DrivingScene框架成功解决了动态驾驶场景重建中质量与效率的平衡问题，为实时4D场景重建提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Real-time, high-fidelity reconstruction of dynamic driving scenes is
challenged by complex dynamics and sparse views, with prior methods struggling
to balance quality and efficiency. We propose DrivingScene, an online,
feed-forward framework that reconstructs 4D dynamic scenes from only two
consecutive surround-view images. Our key innovation is a lightweight residual
flow network that predicts the non-rigid motion of dynamic objects per camera
on top of a learned static scene prior, explicitly modeling dynamics via scene
flow. We also introduce a coarse-to-fine training paradigm that circumvents the
instabilities common to end-to-end approaches. Experiments on nuScenes dataset
show our image-only method simultaneously generates high-quality depth, scene
flow, and 3D Gaussian point clouds online, significantly outperforming
state-of-the-art methods in both dynamic reconstruction and novel view
synthesis.

### [2] [Towards Fine-Grained Human Motion Video Captioning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24767)
*Guorui Song,Guocun Wang,Zhe Huang,Jing Lin,Xuefei Zhe,Jian Li,Haoqian Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出M-ACM模型，通过运动感知解码增强视频描述质量，利用人体网格恢复的运动表示来突出人体动态，减少幻觉并提高语义保真度和空间对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频描述模型难以捕捉细粒度运动细节，导致描述模糊或语义不一致。

Method: M-ACM框架结合运动感知解码，利用人体网格恢复提取运动表示，明确突出人体动态。

Result: 实验结果表明M-ACM在准确描述复杂人体运动和细微时间变化方面显著优于先前方法。

Conclusion: M-ACM为运动中心视频描述设立了新标准，并通过HMI数据集和基准支持该领域研究。

Abstract: Generating accurate descriptions of human actions in videos remains a
challenging task for video captioning models. Existing approaches often
struggle to capture fine-grained motion details, resulting in vague or
semantically inconsistent captions. In this work, we introduce the
Motion-Augmented Caption Model (M-ACM), a novel generative framework that
enhances caption quality by incorporating motion-aware decoding. At its core,
M-ACM leverages motion representations derived from human mesh recovery to
explicitly highlight human body dynamics, thereby reducing hallucinations and
improving both semantic fidelity and spatial alignment in the generated
captions. To support research in this area, we present the Human Motion Insight
(HMI) Dataset, comprising 115K video-description pairs focused on human
movement, along with HMI-Bench, a dedicated benchmark for evaluating
motion-focused video captioning. Experimental results demonstrate that M-ACM
significantly outperforms previous methods in accurately describing complex
human motions and subtle temporal variations, setting a new standard for
motion-centric video captioning.

### [3] [Combining SAR Simulators to Train ATR Models with Synthetic Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24768)
*Benjamin Camus,Julien Houssay,Corentin Le Barbu,Eric Monteux,Cédric Saleun,Christian Cochin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究使用两种不同的SAR模拟器(MOCEM和Salsa)生成合成数据来训练深度学习模型进行SAR图像自动目标识别，以解决真实标注数据缺乏的问题，并在MSTAR数据集上达到近88%的准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于缺乏真实标注的SAR测量数据，研究人员转向使用合成数据。但单一模拟器的简化假设导致合成数据与真实测量存在差异，影响模型泛化能力。

Method: 结合两种基于不同物理模型(MOCEM基于散射中心模型，Salsa基于光线追踪)的SAR模拟器生成合成数据集，使用ADASCA深度学习方法训练ATR模型。

Result: 在MSTAR真实测量数据上达到了接近88%的识别准确率。

Conclusion: 通过结合不同模拟范式的SAR模拟器可以生成更全面的合成数据集，有效提升深度学习模型在真实SAR图像上的自动目标识别性能。

Abstract: This work aims to train Deep Learning models to perform Automatic Target
Recognition (ATR) on Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images. To circumvent the
lack of real labelled measurements, we resort to synthetic data produced by SAR
simulators. Simulation offers full control over the virtual environment, which
enables us to generate large and diversified datasets at will. However,
simulations are intrinsically grounded on simplifying assumptions of the real
world (i.e. physical models). Thus, synthetic datasets are not as
representative as real measurements. Consequently, ATR models trained on
synthetic images cannot generalize well on real measurements. Our contributions
to this problem are twofold: on one hand, we demonstrate and quantify the
impact of the simulation paradigm on the ATR. On the other hand, we propose a
new approach to tackle the ATR problem: combine two SAR simulators that are
grounded on different (but complementary) paradigms to produce synthetic
datasets. To this end, we use two simulators: MOCEM, which is based on a
scattering centers model approach, and Salsa, which resorts on a ray tracing
strategy. We train ATR models using synthetic dataset generated both by MOCEM
and Salsa and our Deep Learning approach called ADASCA. We reach an accuracy of
almost 88 % on the MSTAR measurements.

### [4] [Point-level Uncertainty Evaluation of Mobile Laser Scanning Point Clouds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24773)
*Ziyang Xu,Olaf Wysocki,Christoph Holst*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出基于机器学习的移动激光扫描点云不确定性评估框架，使用随机森林和XGBoost模型，通过几何特征预测点级误差，无需高精度参考数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统后向不确定性建模依赖高精度参考数据，成本高且难以大规模获取，需要一种无需参考数据的不确定性评估方法。

Method: 使用随机森林和XGBoost集成学习模型，学习局部几何特征与点级误差的关系，采用空间分区数据集避免数据泄露。

Result: 两种模型都能有效捕捉几何特征与不确定性的非线性关系，平均ROC-AUC值超过0.87，高程变化、点密度和局部结构复杂度是关键特征。

Conclusion: 该框架为点云质量控制和误差分析提供了可扩展的数据驱动基础，适用于大规模点云应用。

Abstract: Reliable quantification of uncertainty in Mobile Laser Scanning (MLS) point
clouds is essential for ensuring the accuracy and credibility of downstream
applications such as 3D mapping, modeling, and change analysis. Traditional
backward uncertainty modeling heavily rely on high-precision reference data,
which are often costly or infeasible to obtain at large scales. To address this
issue, this study proposes a machine learning-based framework for point-level
uncertainty evaluation that learns the relationship between local geometric
features and point-level errors. The framework is implemented using two
ensemble learning models, Random Forest (RF) and XGBoost, which are trained and
validated on a spatially partitioned real-world dataset to avoid data leakage.
Experimental results demonstrate that both models can effectively capture the
nonlinear relationships between geometric characteristics and uncertainty,
achieving mean ROC-AUC values above 0.87. The analysis further reveals that
geometric features describing elevation variation, point density, and local
structural complexity play a dominant role in predicting uncertainty. The
proposed framework offers a data-driven perspective of uncertainty evaluation,
providing a scalable and adaptable foundation for future quality control and
error analysis of large-scale point clouds.

### [5] [Cross-Enhanced Multimodal Fusion of Eye-Tracking and Facial Features for Alzheimer's Disease Diagnosis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24777)
*Yujie Nie,Jianzhang Ni,Yonglong Ye,Yuan-Ting Zhang,Yun Kwok Wing,Xiangqing Xu,Xin Ma,Lizhou Fan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种多模态交叉增强融合框架，通过眼动追踪和面部特征的协同整合来辅助阿尔茨海默病诊断，在25名AD患者和25名健康对照者的数据集上达到95.11%的分类准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 阿尔茨海默病的准确诊断对于及时干预至关重要。眼动追踪和面部特征作为认知功能的重要指标，反映了注意力分布和神经认知状态，但很少有研究探索它们的联合整合用于辅助AD诊断。

Method: 提出了多模态交叉增强融合框架，包含两个关键模块：(a)交叉增强融合注意力模块(CEFAM)，通过交叉注意力和全局增强建模模态间交互；(b)方向感知卷积模块(DACM)，通过水平-垂直感受野捕获细粒度方向性面部特征。

Result: 在构建的同步多模态数据集上进行的广泛实验表明，该框架优于传统的后期融合和特征拼接方法，在区分AD和健康对照者方面达到95.11%的分类准确率。

Conclusion: 通过显式建模模态间依赖关系和模态特定贡献，该框架在阿尔茨海默病诊断中展现出卓越的鲁棒性和诊断性能，为多模态辅助诊断提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is essential for enabling
timely intervention and slowing disease progression. Multimodal diagnostic
approaches offer considerable promise by integrating complementary information
across behavioral and perceptual domains. Eye-tracking and facial features, in
particular, are important indicators of cognitive function, reflecting
attentional distribution and neurocognitive state. However, few studies have
explored their joint integration for auxiliary AD diagnosis. In this study, we
propose a multimodal cross-enhanced fusion framework that synergistically
leverages eye-tracking and facial features for AD detection. The framework
incorporates two key modules: (a) a Cross-Enhanced Fusion Attention Module
(CEFAM), which models inter-modal interactions through cross-attention and
global enhancement, and (b) a Direction-Aware Convolution Module (DACM), which
captures fine-grained directional facial features via horizontal-vertical
receptive fields. Together, these modules enable adaptive and discriminative
multimodal representation learning. To support this work, we constructed a
synchronized multimodal dataset, including 25 patients with AD and 25 healthy
controls (HC), by recording aligned facial video and eye-tracking sequences
during a visual memory-search paradigm, providing an ecologically valid
resource for evaluating integration strategies. Extensive experiments on this
dataset demonstrate that our framework outperforms traditional late fusion and
feature concatenation methods, achieving a classification accuracy of 95.11% in
distinguishing AD from HC, highlighting superior robustness and diagnostic
performance by explicitly modeling inter-modal dependencies and
modality-specific contributions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 智能车辆自动化趋势中，车道路径检测是重要应用需求，需要高效实时的检测系统。

Method: 采用FPGA硬件平台，基于Sobel边缘检测算法，集成自动光照和温度控制单元以适应环境条件。

Result: 系统运行频率150MHz，处理416x416图像仅需1.17ms，能够准确检测车道数量、当前车道位置及边界。

Conclusion: 该FPGA架构为智能车辆提供了高效实时的车道检测解决方案，具有良好的环境适应性。

Abstract: Intelligent vehicles are one of the most important outcomes gained from the
world tendency toward automation. Applications of IVs, whether in urban roads
or robot tracks, do prioritize lane path detection. This paper proposes an
FPGA-based Lane Detector Vehicle LDV architecture that relies on the Sobel
algorithm for edge detection. Operating on 416 x 416 images and 150 MHz, the
system can generate a valid output every 1.17 ms. The valid output consists of
the number of present lanes, the current lane index, as well as its right and
left boundaries. Additionally, the automated light and temperature control
units in the proposed system enhance its adaptability to the surrounding
environmental conditions.

### [7] [ESCA: Enabling Seamless Codec Avatar Execution through Algorithm and Hardware Co-Optimization for Virtual Reality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24787)
*Mingzhi Zhu,Ding Shang,Sai Qian Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出ESCA全栈优化框架，通过后训练量化和定制硬件加速器，在资源受限的VR设备上实现高保真Codec Avatar模型的实时推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决Codec Avatar模型在VR设备上计算需求大、实时推理困难的问题，特别是在头戴式显示器等资源受限设备上，延迟和功耗是关键挑战。

Method: 1. 针对Codec Avatar模型定制高效后训练量化方法；2. 设计可集成到VR设备SoC中的定制硬件加速器；3. 构建ESCA全栈优化框架。

Result: ESCA将FovVideoVDP质量分数比最佳4位基线提升+0.39，延迟降低3.36倍，端到端测试中维持100fps渲染速率，满足实时VR要求。

Conclusion: 证明了在资源受限设备上部署高保真Codec Avatar的可行性，为更沉浸式和便携的VR体验打开了大门。

Abstract: Photorealistic Codec Avatars (PCA), which generate high-fidelity human face
renderings, are increasingly being used in Virtual Reality (VR) environments to
enable immersive communication and interaction through deep learning-based
generative models. However, these models impose significant computational
demands, making real-time inference challenging on resource-constrained VR
devices such as head-mounted displays, where latency and power efficiency are
critical. To address this challenge, we propose an efficient post-training
quantization (PTQ) method tailored for Codec Avatar models, enabling
low-precision execution without compromising output quality. In addition, we
design a custom hardware accelerator that can be integrated into the
system-on-chip of VR devices to further enhance processing efficiency. Building
on these components, we introduce ESCA, a full-stack optimization framework
that accelerates PCA inference on edge VR platforms. Experimental results
demonstrate that ESCA boosts FovVideoVDP quality scores by up to $+0.39$ over
the best 4-bit baseline, delivers up to $3.36\times$ latency reduction, and
sustains a rendering rate of 100 frames per second in end-to-end tests,
satisfying real-time VR requirements. These results demonstrate the feasibility
of deploying high-fidelity codec avatars on resource-constrained devices,
opening the door to more immersive and portable VR experiences.

### [8] [The Underappreciated Power of Vision Models for Graph Structural Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24788)
*Xinjian Zhao,Wei Pang,Zhongkai Xue,Xiangru Jian,Lei Zhang,Yaoyao Xu,Xiaozhuang Song,Shu Wu,Tianshu Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 视觉模型在图结构理解方面具有与GNNs相当的性能，但在需要全局拓扑感知的任务中表现更优，特别是在GraphAbstract基准测试中显著优于GNNs。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究视觉模型在图理解中的潜力，因为GNNs采用自下而上的消息传递机制，与人类视觉感知从全局结构入手的直觉方式存在根本差异。

Method: 引入GraphAbstract基准测试，评估模型感知全局图属性的能力，包括识别组织原型、检测对称性、感知连接强度和识别关键元素。

Result: 视觉模型在需要整体结构理解的任务中显著优于GNNs，且在不同图规模下保持泛化能力，而GNNs在全局模式抽象方面表现不佳且随图规模增大性能下降。

Conclusion: 视觉模型在图结构理解方面具有显著但未被充分利用的能力，特别是在需要全局拓扑感知和尺度不变推理的问题上，为开发更有效的图基础模型开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks operate through bottom-up message-passing,
fundamentally differing from human visual perception, which intuitively
captures global structures first. We investigate the underappreciated potential
of vision models for graph understanding, finding they achieve performance
comparable to GNNs on established benchmarks while exhibiting distinctly
different learning patterns. These divergent behaviors, combined with
limitations of existing benchmarks that conflate domain features with
topological understanding, motivate our introduction of GraphAbstract. This
benchmark evaluates models' ability to perceive global graph properties as
humans do: recognizing organizational archetypes, detecting symmetry, sensing
connectivity strength, and identifying critical elements. Our results reveal
that vision models significantly outperform GNNs on tasks requiring holistic
structural understanding and maintain generalizability across varying graph
scales, while GNNs struggle with global pattern abstraction and degrade with
increasing graph size. This work demonstrates that vision models possess
remarkable yet underutilized capabilities for graph structural understanding,
particularly for problems requiring global topological awareness and
scale-invariant reasoning. These findings open new avenues to leverage this
underappreciated potential for developing more effective graph foundation
models for tasks dominated by holistic pattern recognition.

*Jingjun Bi,Fadi Dornaika*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出RSGSLM方法，结合图卷积网络、伪标签和拓扑平衡校正，用于多视图数据的半监督学习


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法在处理缺乏清晰图结构的图像数据和复杂多视图数据时效率有限，且多视图数据的图结构整合仍具挑战性

Method: 结合线性特征变换和多视图图融合的GCN框架，动态整合伪标签到损失函数，校正类边界附近样本权重的拓扑不平衡，引入适用于所有样本的无监督平滑损失

Result: 在多视图基准图像数据集上的实验表明，RSGSLM超越了现有的半监督学习方法

Conclusion: RSGSLM通过优化图结构整合和伪标签使用，在多视图半监督学习中实现了更好的性能，同时保持计算效率

Abstract: Recently, graph-based semi-supervised learning and pseudo-labeling have
gained attention due to their effectiveness in reducing the need for extensive
data annotations. Pseudo-labeling uses predictions from unlabeled data to
improve model training, while graph-based methods are characterized by
processing data represented as graphs. However, the lack of clear graph
structures in images combined with the complexity of multi-view data limits the
efficiency of traditional and existing techniques. Moreover, the integration of
graph structures in multi-view data is still a challenge. In this paper, we
propose Re-node Self-taught Graph-based Semi-supervised Learning for Multi-view
Data (RSGSLM). Our method addresses these challenges by (i) combining linear
feature transformation and multi-view graph fusion within a Graph Convolutional
Network (GCN) framework, (ii) dynamically incorporating pseudo-labels into the
GCN loss function to improve classification in multi-view data, and (iii)
correcting topological imbalances by adjusting the weights of labeled samples
near class boundaries. Additionally, (iv) we introduce an unsupervised
smoothing loss applicable to all samples. This combination optimizes
performance while maintaining computational efficiency. Experimental results on
multi-view benchmark image datasets demonstrate that RSGSLM surpasses existing
semi-supervised learning approaches in multi-view contexts.

### [10] [PISA-Bench: The PISA Index as a Multilingual and Multimodal Metric for the Evaluation of Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24792)
*Patrick Haller,Fabio Barth,Jonas Golde,Georg Rehm,Alan Akbik*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PISA-Bench是一个多语言视觉语言基准测试，基于PISA考试构建，覆盖6种语言，用于评估多模态推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试缺乏高质量人工验证样本，多依赖LLM生成内容，且主要限于英语，需要多语言高质量数据集来填补空白。

Method: 从PISA考试中提取人工创建的指令、问题、选项和图像，翻译成5种语言，构建完全平行的6语言语料库。

Result: 评估发现小模型(<20B参数)得分低，非英语版本性能显著下降，空间和几何推理错误率高。

Conclusion: PISA-Bench为推进多语言多模态推理研究提供了重要资源，揭示了当前模型在跨语言和复杂推理任务上的局限性。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable progress in
multimodal reasoning. However, existing benchmarks remain limited in terms of
high-quality, human-verified examples. Many current datasets rely on
synthetically generated content by large language models (LLMs). Furthermore,
most datasets are limited to English, as manual quality assurance of translated
samples is time-consuming and costly. To fill this gap, we introduce
PISA-Bench, a multilingual benchmark derived from English examples of the
expert-created PISA tests, a unified framework for the assessment of student
competencies in over eighty countries. Each example consists of human-extracted
instructions, questions, answer options, and images, enriched with question
type categories, and has been translated from English into five additional
languages (Spanish, German, Chinese, French, and Italian), resulting in a fully
parallel corpus covering six languages. We evaluate state-of-the-art
vision-language models on PISA-Bench and find that especially small models
(<20B parameters) fail to achieve high test scores. We further find substantial
performance degradation on non-English splits as well as high error-rates when
models are tasked with spatial and geometric reasoning. By releasing the
dataset and evaluation framework, we provide a resource for advancing research
on multilingual multimodal reasoning.

TL;DR: 这是关于高效视觉-语言-动作模型（Efficient VLAs）的首个全面综述，提出了统一分类法来组织该领域的研究，涵盖高效模型设计、高效训练和高效数据收集三大支柱。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉-语言-动作模型（VLAs）在具身智能中具有重要作用，但其部署受到大规模基础模型带来的巨大计算和数据需求的严重阻碍。

Method: 引入统一分类法，将现有技术分为三大核心支柱：高效模型设计（关注高效架构和模型压缩）、高效训练（减少模型学习期间的计算负担）和高效数据收集（解决机器人数据获取和利用的瓶颈）。

Conclusion: 该综述为高效视觉-语言-动作模型领域提供了系统性的组织框架和未来发展方向，并维护持续更新的项目页面来跟踪最新进展。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action models (VLAs) represent a significant frontier in
embodied intelligence, aiming to bridge digital knowledge with physical-world
interaction. While these models have demonstrated remarkable generalist
capabilities, their deployment is severely hampered by the substantial
computational and data requirements inherent to their underlying large-scale
foundation models. Motivated by the urgent need to address these challenges,
this survey presents the first comprehensive review of Efficient
Vision-Language-Action models (Efficient VLAs) across the entire
data-model-training process. Specifically, we introduce a unified taxonomy to
systematically organize the disparate efforts in this domain, categorizing
current techniques into three core pillars: (1) Efficient Model Design,
focusing on efficient architectures and model compression; (2) Efficient
Training, which reduces computational burdens during model learning; and (3)
Efficient Data Collection, which addresses the bottlenecks in acquiring and
utilizing robotic data. Through a critical review of state-of-the-art methods
within this framework, this survey not only establishes a foundational
reference for the community but also summarizes representative applications,
delineates key challenges, and charts a roadmap for future research. We
maintain a continuously updated project page to track our latest developments:

### [12] [Conflict Adaptation in Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24804)
*Xiaoyang Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究发现13个视觉语言模型中有12个表现出与人类冲突适应一致的行为，通过稀疏自编码器识别出任务相关的超节点，揭示了模型处理冲突的神经机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究人类认知控制中的冲突适应现象是否在视觉语言模型中出现，以及理解这种行为背后的表征基础。

Method: 使用顺序Stroop任务测试13个视觉语言模型，采用稀疏自编码器识别InternVL 3.5 4B模型中的任务相关超节点。

Result: 12个模型表现出冲突适应行为；识别出早期和晚期层中部分重叠的文本和颜色超节点；在24-25层发现冲突调节超节点，其消融显著增加Stroop错误。

Conclusion: 视觉语言模型表现出与人类相似的冲突适应行为，其神经表征机制反映了人类认知控制的自动性不对称特征。

Abstract: A signature of human cognitive control is conflict adaptation: improved
performance on a high-conflict trial following another high-conflict trial.
This phenomenon offers an account for how cognitive control, a scarce resource,
is recruited. Using a sequential Stroop task, we find that 12 of 13
vision-language models (VLMs) tested exhibit behavior consistent with conflict
adaptation, with the lone exception likely reflecting a ceiling effect. To
understand the representational basis of this behavior, we use sparse
autoencoders (SAEs) to identify task-relevant supernodes in InternVL 3.5 4B.
Partially overlapping supernodes emerge for text and color in both early and
late layers, and their relative sizes mirror the automaticity asymmetry between
reading and color naming in humans. We further isolate a conflict-modulated
supernode in layers 24-25 whose ablation significantly increases Stroop errors
while minimally affecting congruent trials.

### [13] [DualCap: Enhancing Lightweight Image Captioning via Dual Retrieval with Similar Scenes Visual Prompts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24813)
*Binbin Li,Guimiao Yang,Zisen Qi,Haiping Wang,Yu Ding*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DualCap是一种轻量级检索增强图像描述模型，通过双检索机制生成视觉提示来丰富视觉表示，在减少可训练参数的同时保持竞争力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有轻量级检索增强图像描述模型仅将检索数据用作文本提示，导致原始视觉特征未得到增强，特别是在对象细节和复杂场景方面存在语义鸿沟。

Method: 提出DualCap方法，采用双检索机制：标准图像到文本检索用于文本提示，新颖的图像到图像检索用于获取视觉相似场景。从视觉相似场景的标题中提取关键词和短语，通过轻量级可训练特征融合网络将文本特征与原始图像特征集成。

Result: 大量实验表明，该方法在保持竞争力的同时，相比之前的视觉提示描述方法需要更少的可训练参数。

Conclusion: DualCap通过双检索机制有效增强了视觉表示，在减少模型复杂度的同时提升了图像描述性能。

Abstract: Recent lightweight retrieval-augmented image caption models often utilize
retrieved data solely as text prompts, thereby creating a semantic gap by
leaving the original visual features unenhanced, particularly for object
details or complex scenes. To address this limitation, we propose $DualCap$, a
novel approach that enriches the visual representation by generating a visual
prompt from retrieved similar images. Our model employs a dual retrieval
mechanism, using standard image-to-text retrieval for text prompts and a novel
image-to-image retrieval to source visually analogous scenes. Specifically,
salient keywords and phrases are derived from the captions of visually similar
scenes to capture key objects and similar details. These textual features are
then encoded and integrated with the original image features through a
lightweight, trainable feature fusion network. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance while requiring
fewer trainable parameters compared to previous visual-prompting captioning
approaches.

TL;DR: 提出一个三阶段框架，结合深度视觉表征和传统机器学习方法，用于鱼类新鲜度评估，在FFE数据集上达到85.99%的准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统感官评估鱼类新鲜度存在主观性、耗时和不一致的问题，现有深度学习方法在准确性和特征透明度方面仍有挑战。

Method: 三阶段框架：1) 微调五种先进视觉架构；2) 提取多级深度特征训练七种传统分类器；3) 使用LGBM、随机森林和Lasso进行特征选择。

Result: 在FFE数据集上，Swin-Tiny特征+Extra Trees分类器+LGBM特征选择的最佳配置达到85.99%准确率，比现有研究提升8.69-22.78%。

Conclusion: 该框架在视觉质量评估任务中表现出有效性和泛化能力，为鱼类新鲜度评估提供了可靠解决方案。

Abstract: Assessing fish freshness is vital for ensuring food safety and minimizing
economic losses in the seafood industry. However, traditional sensory
evaluation remains subjective, time-consuming, and inconsistent. Although
recent advances in deep learning have automated visual freshness prediction,
challenges related to accuracy and feature transparency persist. This study
introduces a unified three-stage framework that refines and leverages deep
visual representations for reliable fish freshness assessment. First, five
state-of-the-art vision architectures - ResNet-50, DenseNet-121,
EfficientNet-B0, ConvNeXt-Base, and Swin-Tiny - are fine-tuned to establish a
strong baseline. Next, multi-level deep features extracted from these backbones
are used to train seven classical machine learning classifiers, integrating
deep and traditional decision mechanisms. Finally, feature selection methods
based on Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LGBM), Random Forest, and Lasso
identify a compact and informative subset of features. Experiments on the
Freshness of the Fish Eyes (FFE) dataset demonstrate that the best
configuration combining Swin-Tiny features, an Extra Trees classifier, and
LGBM-based feature selection achieves an accuracy of 85.99%, outperforming
recent studies on the same dataset by 8.69-22.78%. These findings confirm the
effectiveness and generalizability of the proposed framework for visual quality
evaluation tasks.

Motivation: 传统视频假新闻检测基准只关注最终决策准确性，缺乏对整个检测过程的细粒度评估，使得检测过程成为黑箱。

Method: 基于经验分析构建MVFNDB基准，包含9730个视频相关问题，并设计MVFND-CoT框架整合多种特征进行推理。

Result: 通过基准深入分析了影响准确性的深层因素，包括视频处理策略以及视频特征与模型能力的对齐。

Conclusion: 该基准为未来MLLMs在视频假新闻检测领域的评估和发展奠定了坚实基础。

Abstract: The advent of multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) has greatly advanced
research into applications for Video fake news detection (VFND) tasks.
Traditional video-based FND benchmarks typically focus on the accuracy of the
final decision, often failing to provide fine-grained assessments for the
entire detection process, making the detection process a black box. Therefore,
we introduce the MVFNDB (Multi-modal Video Fake News Detection Benchmark) based
on the empirical analysis, which provides foundation for tasks definition. The
benchmark comprises 10 tasks and is meticulously crafted to probe MLLMs'
perception, understanding, and reasoning capacities during detection, featuring
9730 human-annotated video-related questions based on a carefully constructed
taxonomy ability of VFND. To validate the impact of combining multiple features
on the final results, we design a novel framework named MVFND-CoT, which
incorporates both creator-added content and original shooting footage
reasoning. Building upon the benchmark, we conduct an in-depth analysis of the
deeper factors influencing accuracy, including video processing strategies and
the alignment between video features and model capabilities. We believe this
benchmark will lay a solid foundation for future evaluations and advancements
of MLLMs in the domain of video fake news detection.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着文本到图像模型的快速发展，确保其安全性变得日益重要。现有的推理时安全方法存在过度拒绝和安全性与实用性不平衡的问题。

Method: 提出多轮安全编辑框架，构建MR-SafeEdit数据集，开发统一MLLM模型SafeEditor，采用后处理安全编辑范式，模拟人类识别和优化不安全内容的认知过程。

Result: 实验结果表明，SafeEditor超越了现有安全方法，减少了过度拒绝，实现了更优的安全性与实用性平衡。

Conclusion: 该研究提出的多轮安全编辑框架为文本到图像模型提供了一种模型无关、即插即用的安全对齐解决方案，有效解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of text-to-image (T2I) models, ensuring their
safety has become increasingly critical. Existing safety approaches can be
categorized into training-time and inference-time methods. While inference-time
methods are widely adopted due to their cost-effectiveness, they often suffer
from limitations such as over-refusal and imbalance between safety and utility.
To address these challenges, we propose a multi-round safety editing framework
that functions as a model-agnostic, plug-and-play module, enabling efficient
safety alignment for any text-to-image model. Central to this framework is
MR-SafeEdit, a multi-round image-text interleaved dataset specifically
constructed for safety editing in text-to-image generation. We introduce a
post-hoc safety editing paradigm that mirrors the human cognitive process of
identifying and refining unsafe content. To instantiate this paradigm, we
develop SafeEditor, a unified MLLM capable of multi-round safety editing on
generated images. Experimental results show that SafeEditor surpasses prior
safety approaches by reducing over-refusal while achieving a more favorable
safety-utility balance.

TL;DR: 提出基于多路径跨模态交互的混合网络模型(MCIHN)，通过对抗自编码器学习各模态的判别性情感特征，利用跨模态门机制减少模态差异并生成交互特征，最终实现更好的多模态情感识别性能。

Method: 1. 为每个模态分别构建对抗自编码器(AAE)学习判别性情感特征；2. 将不同模态的潜在编码输入预定义的跨模态门机制模型(CGMM)减少模态差异；3. 使用特征融合模块(FFM)进行多模态融合。

Conclusion: 提出的MCIHN模型通过多路径跨模态交互有效解决了多模态情感识别中的模态差异和特征表征问题，取得了良好的识别效果。

Abstract: Multimodal emotion recognition is crucial for future human-computer
interaction. However, accurate emotion recognition still faces significant
challenges due to differences between different modalities and the difficulty
of characterizing unimodal emotional information. To solve these problems, a
hybrid network model based on multipath cross-modal interaction (MCIHN) is
proposed. First, adversarial autoencoders (AAE) are constructed separately for
each modality. The AAE learns discriminative emotion features and reconstructs
the features through a decoder to obtain more discriminative information about
the emotion classes. Then, the latent codes from the AAE of different
modalities are fed into a predefined Cross-modal Gate Mechanism model (CGMM) to
reduce the discrepancy between modalities, establish the emotional relationship
between interacting modalities, and generate the interaction features between
different modalities. Multimodal fusion using the Feature Fusion module (FFM)
for better emotion recognition. Experiments were conducted on publicly
available SIMS and MOSI datasets, demonstrating that MCIHN achieves superior
performance.

Motivation: 流匹配模型虽然取得了显著成功，但其生成过程质量的影响因素仍不明确。本文旨在从去噪角度实证探究流匹配的生成机制。

Method: 建立流匹配模型与去噪器的形式联系，设计噪声和漂移等原则性扰动来影响样本生成，分析生成过程的不同动态阶段。

Result: 揭示了生成过程的独特动态阶段，能够精确描述去噪器在生成过程哪个阶段成功或失败，以及这为何重要。

Conclusion: 通过去噪视角为流匹配生成过程提供了新的理解框架，有助于更好地理解和改进生成模型性能。

Abstract: Flow matching has achieved remarkable success, yet the factors influencing
the quality of its generation process remain poorly understood. In this work,
we adopt a denoising perspective and design a framework to empirically probe
the generation process. Laying down the formal connections between flow
matching models and denoisers, we provide a common ground to compare their
performances on generation and denoising. This enables the design of principled
and controlled perturbations to influence sample generation: noise and drift.
This leads to new insights on the distinct dynamical phases of the generative
process, enabling us to precisely characterize at which stage of the generative
process denoisers succeed or fail and why this matters.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前深度学习方法将成熟度作为离散分类问题处理，这与生物成熟过程的连续性本质相冲突，导致信息丢失和类别边界模糊。

Method: 在RT-DETRv2实时目标检测器中引入专用的概率头，使模型能够为每个检测对象预测成熟度谱上的连续分布，同时学习平均成熟状态及其相关不确定性。

Result: 在具有挑战性的大规模水果数据集上达到85.6%的平均精度(mAP)，提供比基于分类方法更细粒度和准确的成熟度评估。

Conclusion: 概率方法为现代农业提供了更智能、具有不确定性感知的自动化系统，同时保持了优异的检测性能。

Abstract: Maturity estimation of fruits and vegetables is a critical task for
agricultural automation, directly impacting yield prediction and robotic
harvesting. Current deep learning approaches predominantly treat maturity as a
discrete classification problem (e.g., unripe, ripe, overripe). This rigid
formulation, however, fundamentally conflicts with the continuous nature of the
biological ripening process, leading to information loss and ambiguous class
boundaries. In this paper, we challenge this paradigm by reframing maturity
estimation as a continuous, probabilistic learning task. We propose a novel
architectural modification to the state-of-the-art, real-time object detector,
RT-DETRv2, by introducing a dedicated probabilistic head. This head enables the
model to predict a continuous distribution over the maturity spectrum for each
detected object, simultaneously learning the mean maturity state and its
associated uncertainty. This uncertainty measure is crucial for downstream
decision-making in robotics, providing a confidence score for tasks like
selective harvesting. Our model not only provides a far richer and more
biologically plausible representation of plant maturity but also maintains
exceptional detection performance, achieving a mean Average Precision (mAP) of
85.6\% on a challenging, large-scale fruit dataset. We demonstrate through
extensive experiments that our probabilistic approach offers more granular and
accurate maturity assessments than its classification-based counterparts,
paving the way for more intelligent, uncertainty-aware automated systems in
modern agriculture

Motivation: 解决Alves等人(2024)使用OpenPose进行关键点提取时时间性能不佳的问题，同时避免简单替换为轻量级MediaPipe导致的准确性显著下降。

Method: 探索关键点子集选择策略优化识别性能，并采用基于样条的插值技术处理缺失关键点问题。

Result: 适当的关键点子集实现了与最先进方法相当或更优的性能，同时处理时间相比Alves等人(2024)减少5倍以上。样条插值有效缓解了缺失关键点问题，带来显著的准确性提升。

Conclusion: 精心选择关键点结合简单插值技术，能够实现高效准确的手语识别，为可扩展的手语识别系统铺平道路。

Abstract: This paper investigates the feasibility of using lightweight body landmark
detection for the recognition of isolated signs in Brazilian Sign Language
(LIBRAS). Although the skeleton-based approach by Alves et al. (2024) enabled
substantial improvements in recognition performance, the use of OpenPose for
landmark extraction hindered time performance. In a preliminary investigation,
we observed that simply replacing OpenPose with the lightweight MediaPipe,
while improving processing speed, significantly reduced accuracy. To overcome
this limitation, we explored landmark subset selection strategies aimed at
optimizing recognition performance. Experimental results showed that a proper
landmark subset achieves comparable or superior performance to state-of-the-art
methods while reducing processing time by more than 5X compared to Alves et al.
(2024). As an additional contribution, we demonstrated that spline-based
imputation effectively mitigates missing landmark issues, leading to
substantial accuracy gains. These findings highlight that careful landmark
selection, combined with simple imputation techniques, enables efficient and
accurate isolated sign recognition, paving the way for scalable Sign Language
Recognition systems.

Abstract: Traffic congestion is becoming a challenge in the rapidly growing urban
cities, resulting in increasing delays and inefficiencies within urban
transportation systems. To address this issue a comprehensive methodology is
designed to optimize traffic flow and minimize delays. The framework is
structured with three primary components: (a) vehicle detection, (b) traffic
prediction, and (c) traffic signal optimization. This paper presents the first
component, vehicle detection. The methodology involves analyzing multiple
sequential frames from a camera feed to compute the background, i.e. the
underlying roadway, by averaging pixel values over time. The computed
background is then utilized to extract the foreground, where the Density-Based
Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) algorithm is applied to
detect vehicles. With its computational efficiency and minimal infrastructure
modification requirements, the proposed methodology offers a practical and
scalable solution for real-world deployment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到视频生成模型难以泛化到非常规相机运动，而收集具有特定不常见相机运动的训练视频很困难。

Method: 使用合成视频训练扩散模型，采用多重解耦策略将相机运动学习与合成外观伪影分离，使用Unity等引擎渲染低多边形3D场景中的基本几何体。

Result: 能够合成广泛精确控制和复杂的相机运动，仅需简单的合成数据即可实现。

Conclusion: VividCam通过合成数据有效解决了非常规相机运动学习的挑战，为创造原创艺术视频提供了新途径。

Abstract: Although recent text-to-video generative models are getting more capable of
following external camera controls, imposed by either text descriptions or
camera trajectories, they still struggle to generalize to unconventional camera
motions, which is crucial in creating truly original and artistic videos. The
challenge lies in the difficulty of finding sufficient training videos with the
intended uncommon camera motions. To address this challenge, we propose
VividCam, a training paradigm that enables diffusion models to learn complex
camera motions from synthetic videos, releasing the reliance on collecting
realistic training videos. VividCam incorporates multiple disentanglement
strategies that isolates camera motion learning from synthetic appearance
artifacts, ensuring more robust motion representation and mitigating domain
shift. We demonstrate that our design synthesizes a wide range of precisely
controlled and complex camera motions using surprisingly simple synthetic data.
Notably, this synthetic data often consists of basic geometries within a
low-poly 3D scene and can be efficiently rendered by engines like Unity. Our
video results can be found in https://wuqiuche.github.io/VividCamDemoPage/ .

Conclusion: 该方法为理解多视图transformer的内部工作机制提供了新视角，有助于改进模型设计和在关键应用中的使用。

Abstract: Multi-view transformers such as DUSt3R are revolutionizing 3D vision by
solving 3D tasks in a feed-forward manner. However, contrary to previous
optimization-based pipelines, the inner mechanisms of multi-view transformers
are unclear. Their black-box nature makes further improvements beyond data
scaling challenging and complicates usage in safety- and reliability-critical
applications. Here, we present an approach for probing and visualizing 3D
representations from the residual connections of the multi-view transformers'
layers. In this manner, we investigate a variant of the DUSt3R model, shedding
light on the development of its latent state across blocks, the role of the
individual layers, and suggest how it differs from methods with stronger
inductive biases of explicit global pose. Finally, we show that the
investigated variant of DUSt3R estimates correspondences that are refined with
reconstructed geometry. The code used for the analysis is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态学习中，主导模态往往会压制其他模态，限制了模型的泛化能力。需要一种方法来平衡各模态的贡献，增强整体性能。

Method: M-SAM框架包含三个步骤：1）使用Shapley值识别主导模态；2）分解损失景观，调整损失以优先考虑主导模态的鲁棒性；3）通过调制梯度反向传播更新权重。

Result: 在四个不同数据集上的实验表明，M-SAM优于最新的优化和梯度操作方法，显著平衡和改进了多模态学习性能。

Conclusion: M-SAM是一个模型无关的框架，能够有效解决多模态学习中的主导模态问题，提升模型鲁棒性和整体性能。

Abstract: In multimodal learning, dominant modalities often overshadow others, limiting
generalization. We propose Modality-Aware Sharpness-Aware Minimization (M-SAM),
a model-agnostic framework that applies to many modalities and supports early
and late fusion scenarios. In every iteration, M-SAM in three steps optimizes
learning. \textbf{First, it identifies the dominant modality} based on
modalities' contribution in the accuracy using Shapley. \textbf{Second, it
decomposes the loss landscape}, or in another language, it modulates the loss
to prioritize the robustness of the model in favor of the dominant modality,
and \textbf{third, M-SAM updates the weights} by backpropagation of modulated
gradients. This ensures robust learning for the dominant modality while
enhancing contributions from others, allowing the model to explore and exploit
complementary features that strengthen overall performance. Extensive
experiments on four diverse datasets show that M-SAM outperforms the latest
state-of-the-art optimization and gradient manipulation methods and
significantly balances and improves multimodal learning.

Result: 在多普勒衍生数据上应用该方法，实现了接近99%的运动识别准确率，综合性能指标和混淆矩阵证实了该方案的有效性。

Conclusion: IBIS方法显著提高了Wi-Fi感知模型的泛化能力，为解决过拟合问题提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The increasing interest in Wi-Fi sensing stems from its potential to capture
environmental data in a low-cost, non-intrusive way, making it ideal for
applications like healthcare, space occupancy analysis, and gesture-based IoT
control. However, a major limitation in this field is the common problem of
overfitting, where models perform well on training data but fail to generalize
to new data. To overcome this, we introduce a novel hybrid architecture that
integrates Inception-BiLSTM with a Support Vector Machine (SVM), which we refer
to as IBIS. Our IBIS approach is uniquely engineered to improve model
generalization and create more robust classification boundaries. By applying
this method to Doppler-derived data, we achieve a movement recognition accuracy
of nearly 99%. Comprehensive performance metrics and confusion matrices confirm
the significant effectiveness of our proposed solution.

Abstract: Pressure ulcers (PUs) are a serious and prevalent healthcare concern.
Accurate classification of PU severity (Stages I-IV) is essential for proper
treatment but remains challenging due to subtle visual distinctions and
subjective interpretation, leading to variability among clinicians. Prior
AI-based approaches using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision
Transformers (ViTs) achieved promising accuracy but offered limited
interpretability. We present FT-ARM (Fine-Tuned Agentic Reflection Multimodal
model), a fine-tuned multimodal large language model (MLLM) with an agentic
self-reflection mechanism for pressure ulcer severity classification. Inspired
by clinician-style diagnostic reassessment, FT-ARM iteratively refines its
predictions by reasoning over visual features and encoded clinical knowledge
from text, enhancing both accuracy and consistency. On the publicly available
Pressure Injury Image Dataset (PIID), FT-ARM, fine-tuned from LLaMA 3.2 90B,
achieved 85% accuracy in classifying PU stages I-IV, surpassing prior CNN-based
models by +4%. Unlike earlier CNN/ViT studies that relied solely on offline
evaluations, FT-ARM is designed and tested for live inference, reflecting
real-time deployment conditions. Furthermore, it produces clinically grounded
natural-language explanations, improving interpretability and trust. By
integrating fine-tuning and reflective reasoning across multimodal inputs,
FT-ARM advances the reliability, transparency, and clinical applicability of
automated wound assessment systems, addressing the critical need for consistent
and explainable PU staging to support improved patient care.

Abstract: Developing a highly accurate automatic license plate recognition system
(ALPR) is challenging due to environmental factors such as lighting, rain, and
dust. Additional difficulties include high vehicle speeds, varying camera
angles, and low-quality or low-resolution images. ALPR is vital in traffic
control, parking, vehicle tracking, toll collection, and law enforcement
applications. This paper proposes a deep learning strategy using YOLOv8 for
license plate detection and recognition tasks. This method seeks to enhance the
performance of the model using datasets from Ontario, Quebec, California, and
New York State. It achieved an impressive recall rate of 94% on the dataset
from the Center for Pattern Recognition and Machine Intelligence (CENPARMI) and
91% on the UFPR-ALPR dataset. In addition, our method follows a semi-supervised
learning framework, combining a small set of manually labeled data with
pseudo-labels generated by Grounding DINO to train our detection model.
Grounding DINO, a powerful vision-language model, automatically annotates many
images with bounding boxes for license plates, thereby minimizing the reliance
on labor-intensive manual labeling. By integrating human-verified and
model-generated annotations, we can scale our dataset efficiently while
maintaining label quality, which significantly enhances the training process
and overall model performance. Furthermore, it reports character error rates
for both datasets, providing additional insight into system performance.

Abstract: Breast cancer remains the most commonly diagnosed malignancy among women in
the developed world. Early detection through mammography screening plays a
pivotal role in reducing mortality rates. While computer-aided diagnosis (CAD)
systems have shown promise in assisting radiologists, existing approaches face
critical limitations in clinical deployment - particularly in handling the
nuanced interpretation of multi-modal data and feasibility due to the
requirement of prior clinical history. This study introduces a novel framework
that synergistically combines visual features from 2D mammograms with
structured textual descriptors derived from easily accessible clinical metadata
and synthesized radiological reports through innovative tokenization modules.
Our proposed methods in this study demonstrate that strategic integration of
convolutional neural networks (ConvNets) with language representations achieves
superior performance to vision transformer-based models while handling
high-resolution images and enabling practical deployment across diverse
populations. By evaluating it on multi-national cohort screening mammograms,
our multi-modal approach achieves superior performance in cancer detection and
calcification identification compared to unimodal baselines, with particular
improvements. The proposed method establishes a new paradigm for developing
clinically viable VLM-based CAD systems that effectively leverage imaging data
and contextual patient information through effective fusion mechanisms.

Conclusion: DRIP方法有效解决了视觉语言模型预训练效率问题，并在科学领域验证了其应用价值

Abstract: Recently, the advances in vision-language models, including contrastive
pretraining and instruction tuning, have greatly pushed the frontier of
multimodal AI. However, owing to the large-scale and hence expensive
pretraining, the efficiency concern has discouraged researchers from attempting
to pretrain a vision language model from scratch. In this work, we propose
Dynamic patch Reduction via Interpretable Pooling (DRIP), which adapts to the
input images and dynamically merges tokens in the deeper layers of a visual
encoder. Our results on both ImageNet training from scratch and CLIP
contrastive pretraining demonstrate a significant GFLOP reduction while
maintaining comparable classification/zero-shot performance. To further
validate our proposed method, we conduct continual pretraining on a large
biology dataset, extending its impact into scientific domains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决真实世界场景中零样本理解的挑战，因为自然场景的复杂性和多变性要求模型在没有先验标注样本的情况下识别新对象、动作和上下文。

Method: 开发了一个统一模型，将视觉输入和文本提示嵌入到共享空间中，然后通过多模态融合和推理层进行上下文解释。

Abstract: Zero-shot scene understanding in real-world settings presents major
challenges due to the complexity and variability of natural scenes, where
models must recognize new objects, actions, and contexts without prior labeled
examples. This work proposes a vision-language integration framework that
unifies pre-trained visual encoders (e.g., CLIP, ViT) and large language models
(e.g., GPT-based architectures) to achieve semantic alignment between visual
and textual modalities. The goal is to enable robust zero-shot comprehension of
scenes by leveraging natural language as a bridge to generalize over unseen
categories and contexts. Our approach develops a unified model that embeds
visual inputs and textual prompts into a shared space, followed by multimodal
fusion and reasoning layers for contextual interpretation. Experiments on
Visual Genome, COCO, ADE20K, and custom real-world datasets demonstrate
significant gains over state-of-the-art zero-shot models in object recognition,
activity detection, and scene captioning. The proposed system achieves up to
18% improvement in top-1 accuracy and notable gains in semantic coherence
metrics, highlighting the effectiveness of cross-modal alignment and language
grounding in enhancing generalization for real-world scene understanding.

Abstract: Recent advancements in personalized image generation have significantly
improved facial identity preservation, particularly in fields such as
entertainment and social media. However, existing methods still struggle to
achieve precise control over facial attributes in a per-subject-tuning-free
(PSTF) way. Tuning-based techniques like PreciseControl have shown promise by
providing fine-grained control over facial features, but they often require
extensive technical expertise and additional training data, limiting their
accessibility. In contrast, PSTF approaches simplify the process by enabling
image generation from a single facial input, but they lack precise control over
facial attributes. In this paper, we introduce a novel, PSTF method that
enables both precise control over facial attributes and high-fidelity
preservation of facial identity. Our approach utilizes a face recognition model
to extract facial identity features, which are then mapped into the $W^+$
latent space of StyleGAN2 using the e4e encoder. We further enhance the model
with a Triplet-Decoupled Cross-Attention module, which integrates facial
identity, attribute features, and text embeddings into the UNet architecture,
ensuring clean separation of identity and attribute information. Trained on the
FFHQ dataset, our method allows for the generation of personalized images with
fine-grained control over facial attributes, while without requiring additional
fine-tuning or training data for individual identities. We demonstrate that our
approach successfully balances personalization with precise facial attribute
control, offering a more efficient and user-friendly solution for high-quality,
adaptable facial image synthesis. The code is publicly available at

Abstract: Zero-shot Human-Object Interaction detection aims to localize humans and
objects in an image and recognize their interaction, even when specific
verb-object pairs are unseen during training. Recent works have shown promising
results using prompt learning with pretrained vision-language models such as
CLIP, which align natural language prompts with visual features in a shared
embedding space. However, existing approaches still fail to handle the visual
complexity of interaction, including (1) intra-class visual diversity, where
instances of the same verb appear in diverse poses and contexts, and (2)
inter-class visual entanglement, where distinct verbs yield visually similar
patterns. To address these challenges, we propose VDRP, a framework for Visual
Diversity and Region-aware Prompt learning. First, we introduce a visual
diversity-aware prompt learning strategy that injects group-wise visual
variance into the context embedding. We further apply Gaussian perturbation to
encourage the prompts to capture diverse visual variations of a verb. Second,
we retrieve region-specific concepts from the human, object, and union regions.
These are used to augment the diversity-aware prompt embeddings, yielding
region-aware prompts that enhance verb-level discrimination. Experiments on the
HICO-DET benchmark demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance under four zero-shot evaluation settings, effectively addressing
both intra-class diversity and inter-class visual entanglement. Code is

Conclusion: 该方法通过结合亚特兰大世界引导和隐式结构高斯泼溅，成功实现了平滑、高效且保留细节的场景重建。

Abstract: 3D reconstruction of indoor and urban environments is a prominent research
topic with various downstream applications. However, existing geometric priors
for addressing low-texture regions in indoor and urban settings often lack
global consistency. Moreover, Gaussian Splatting and implicit SDF fields often
suffer from discontinuities or exhibit computational inefficiencies, resulting
in a loss of detail. To address these issues, we propose an Atlanta-world
guided implicit-structured Gaussian Splatting that achieves smooth indoor and
urban scene reconstruction while preserving high-frequency details and
rendering efficiency. By leveraging the Atlanta-world model, we ensure the
accurate surface reconstruction for low-texture regions, while the proposed
novel implicit-structured GS representations provide smoothness without
sacrificing efficiency and high-frequency details. Specifically, we propose a
semantic GS representation to predict the probability of all semantic regions
and deploy a structure plane regularization with learnable plane indicators for
global accurate surface reconstruction. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in both indoor and urban
scenes, delivering superior surface reconstruction quality.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Region-CAM是一种新的类激活映射方法，通过提取语义信息图并进行语义信息传播，解决了传统CAM方法只突出最具判别性区域的问题，显著提升了弱监督语义分割和物体定位的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统CAM方法只突出目标的最具判别性区域，这些区域往往无法覆盖整个物体，且与物体边界不对齐，限制了弱监督学习任务的性能，特别是需要像素级精确激活图的弱监督语义分割任务。

Method: Region-CAM通过提取语义信息图(SIMs)并进行语义信息传播(SIP)，同时考虑基线分类模型各阶段的梯度和特征，生成更完整的激活图。

Result: 在PASCAL VOC数据集上，Region-CAM达到60.12%和58.43%的mIoU，相比原始CAM提升13.61%和13.13%；在MS COCO验证集上达到36.38%，提升16.23%；在ILSVRC2012验证集上达到51.7%的Top-1定位精度，比LayerCAM提升4.5%。

Conclusion: Region-CAM能够突出更大比例的物体区域，同时确保激活图具有精确的边界，在弱监督语义分割和物体定位任务中都表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Class Activation Mapping (CAM) methods are widely applied in weakly
supervised learning tasks due to their ability to highlight object regions.
However, conventional CAM methods highlight only the most discriminative
regions of the target. These highlighted regions often fail to cover the entire
object and are frequently misaligned with object boundaries, thereby limiting
the performance of downstream weakly supervised learning tasks, particularly
Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation (WSSS), which demands pixel-wise
accurate activation maps to get the best results. To alleviate the above
problems, we propose a novel activation method, Region-CAM. Distinct from
network feature weighting approaches, Region-CAM generates activation maps by
extracting semantic information maps (SIMs) and performing semantic information
propagation (SIP) by considering both gradients and features in each of the
stages of the baseline classification model. Our approach highlights a greater
proportion of object regions while ensuring activation maps to have precise
boundaries that align closely with object edges. Region-CAM achieves 60.12% and
58.43% mean intersection over union (mIoU) using the baseline model on the
PASCAL VOC training and validation datasets, respectively, which are
improvements of 13.61% and 13.13% over the original CAM (46.51% and 45.30%). On
the MS COCO validation set, Region-CAM achieves 36.38%, a 16.23% improvement
over the original CAM (20.15%). We also demonstrate the superiority of
Region-CAM in object localization tasks, using the ILSVRC2012 validation set.
Region-CAM achieves 51.7% in Top-1 Localization accuracy Loc1. Compared with
LayerCAM, an activation method designed for weakly supervised object
localization, Region-CAM achieves 4.5% better performance in Loc1.

Conclusion: DINO-YOLO在数据受限的土木工程数据集(<10K图像)上建立了最先进的性能，同时保持计算效率，为施工安全监控和基础设施检测提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Object detection in civil engineering applications is constrained by limited
annotated data in specialized domains. We introduce DINO-YOLO, a hybrid
architecture combining YOLOv12 with DINOv3 self-supervised vision transformers
for data-efficient detection. DINOv3 features are strategically integrated at
two locations: input preprocessing (P0) and mid-backbone enhancement (P3).
Experimental validation demonstrates substantial improvements: Tunnel Segment
Crack detection (648 images) achieves 12.4% improvement, Construction PPE (1K
images) gains 13.7%, and KITTI (7K images) shows 88.6% improvement, while
maintaining real-time inference (30-47 FPS). Systematic ablation across five
YOLO scales and nine DINOv3 variants reveals that Medium-scale architectures
achieve optimal performance with DualP0P3 integration (55.77% mAP@0.5), while
Small-scale requires Triple Integration (53.63%). The 2-4x inference overhead
(21-33ms versus 8-16ms baseline) remains acceptable for field deployment on
NVIDIA RTX 5090. DINO-YOLO establishes state-of-the-art performance for civil

Conclusion: ReGap方法通过动态重构误差提高了检测精度，增强了误差分离能力，解决了现有静态重构误差方法的局限性

Abstract: The rise of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) has made detecting
AI-generated images a critical challenge for ensuring authenticity. Existing
reconstruction-based methods lack theoretical foundations and on empirical
heuristics, limiting interpretability and reliability. In this paper, we
introduce the Jacobian-Spectral Lower Bound for reconstruction error from a
geometric perspective, showing that real images off the reconstruction manifold
exhibit a non-trivial error lower bound, while generated images on the manifold
have near-zero error. Furthermore, we reveal the limitations of existing
methods that rely on static reconstruction error from a single pass. These
methods often fail when some real images exhibit lower error than generated
ones. This counterintuitive behavior reduces detection accuracy and requires
data-specific threshold tuning, limiting their applicability in real-world
scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose ReGap, a training-free
method that computes dynamic reconstruction error by leveraging structured
editing operations to introduce controlled perturbations. This enables
measuring error changes before and after editing, improving detection accuracy
by enhancing error separation. Experimental results show that our method
outperforms existing baselines, exhibits robustness to common post-processing
operations and generalizes effectively across diverse conditions.

Abstract: Current 3D scene understanding methods are limited by offline-collected
multi-view data or pre-constructed 3D geometry. In this paper, we present
ExtractAnything3D (EA3D), a unified online framework for open-world 3D object
extraction that enables simultaneous geometric reconstruction and holistic
scene understanding. Given a streaming video, EA3D dynamically interprets each
frame using vision-language and 2D vision foundation encoders to extract
object-level knowledge. This knowledge is integrated and embedded into a
Gaussian feature map via a feed-forward online update strategy. We then
iteratively estimate visual odometry from historical frames and incrementally
update online Gaussian features with new observations. A recurrent joint
optimization module directs the model's attention to regions of interest,
simultaneously enhancing both geometric reconstruction and semantic
understanding. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks and tasks,
including photo-realistic rendering, semantic and instance segmentation, 3D
bounding box and semantic occupancy estimation, and 3D mesh generation,
demonstrate the effectiveness of EA3D. Our method establishes a unified and
efficient framework for joint online 3D reconstruction and holistic scene
understanding, enabling a broad range of downstream tasks.

Conclusion: 该方法实现了在消费级硬件上的实时自动化厚度重建，为连续监测眼表泪膜和无创诊断干眼症等疾病开辟了新可能。

Abstract: Thin film interferometry is a powerful technique for non-invasively measuring
liquid film thickness with applications in ophthalmology, but its clinical
translation is hindered by the challenges in reconstructing thickness profiles
from interference patterns - an ill-posed inverse problem complicated by phase
periodicity, imaging noise and ambient artifacts. Traditional reconstruction
methods are either computationally intensive, sensitive to noise, or require
manual expert analysis, which is impractical for real-time diagnostics. To
address this challenge, here we present a vision transformer-based approach for
real-time inference of thin liquid film thickness profiles directly from
isolated interferograms. Trained on a hybrid dataset combining
physiologically-relevant synthetic and experimental tear film data, our model
leverages long-range spatial correlations to resolve phase ambiguities and
reconstruct temporally coherent thickness profiles in a single forward pass
from dynamic interferograms acquired in vivo and ex vivo. The network
demonstrates state-of-the-art performance on noisy, rapidly-evolving films with
motion artifacts, overcoming limitations of conventional phase-unwrapping and
iterative fitting methods. Our data-driven approach enables automated,
consistent thickness reconstruction at real-time speeds on consumer hardware,
opening new possibilities for continuous monitoring of pre-lens ocular tear
films and non-invasive diagnosis of conditions such as the dry eye disease.

Abstract: Deep generative models, such as diffusion models, have shown promising
progress in image generation and audio generation via simplified continuity
assumptions. However, the development of generative modeling techniques for
generating multi-modal data, such as parametric CAD sequences, still lags
behind due to the challenges in addressing long-range constraints and parameter
sensitivity. In this work, we propose a novel framework for quantitatively
constrained CAD generation, termed Target-Guided Bayesian Flow Network (TGBFN).
For the first time, TGBFN handles the multi-modality of CAD sequences (i.e.,
discrete commands and continuous parameters) in a unified continuous and
differentiable parameter space rather than in the discrete data space. In
addition, TGBFN penetrates the parameter update kernel and introduces a guided
Bayesian flow to control the CAD properties. To evaluate TGBFN, we construct a
new dataset for quantitatively constrained CAD generation. Extensive
comparisons across single-condition and multi-condition constrained generation
tasks demonstrate that TGBFN achieves state-of-the-art performance in
generating high-fidelity, condition-aware CAD sequences. The code is available

Conclusion: D²GS框架成功实现了无需LiDAR的高质量城市场景重建，通过深度预测和扩散先验获得了比LiDAR更密集、更准确的几何先验

Abstract: Recently, Gaussian Splatting (GS) has shown great potential for urban scene
reconstruction in the field of autonomous driving. However, current urban scene
reconstruction methods often depend on multimodal sensors as inputs,
\textit{i.e.} LiDAR and images. Though the geometry prior provided by LiDAR
point clouds can largely mitigate ill-posedness in reconstruction, acquiring
such accurate LiDAR data is still challenging in practice: i) precise
spatiotemporal calibration between LiDAR and other sensors is required, as they
may not capture data simultaneously; ii) reprojection errors arise from spatial
misalignment when LiDAR and cameras are mounted at different locations. To
avoid the difficulty of acquiring accurate LiDAR depth, we propose $D^2GS$, a
LiDAR-free urban scene reconstruction framework. In this work, we obtain
geometry priors that are as effective as LiDAR while being denser and more
accurate. $\textbf{First}$, we initialize a dense point cloud by
back-projecting multi-view metric depth predictions. This point cloud is then
optimized by a Progressive Pruning strategy to improve the global consistency.
$\textbf{Second}$, we jointly refine Gaussian geometry and predicted dense
metric depth via a Depth Enhancer. Specifically, we leverage diffusion priors
from a depth foundation model to enhance the depth maps rendered by Gaussians.
In turn, the enhanced depths provide stronger geometric constraints during
Gaussian training. $\textbf{Finally}$, we improve the accuracy of ground
geometry by constraining the shape and normal attributes of Gaussians within
road regions. Extensive experiments on the Waymo dataset demonstrate that our
method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, producing more
accurate geometry even when compared with those using ground-truth LiDAR data.

TL;DR: 提出扩展上下文感知分类器(ECAC)，通过动态调整分类器来解决语义分割中固定参数分类器无法适应图像特定类别分布的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统语义分割方法使用固定参数分类器，无法适应每张图像不同的类别分布，且数据集级别的类别不平衡会导致模型偏向多数类，限制了对少数类区域的识别能力。

Method: 使用内存库学习数据集级别的上下文信息，结合当前图像的类别特定上下文信息来改进分类器；采用教师-学生网络范式，教师网络动态调整上下文信息并传递知识给学生网络。

Result: 在ADE20K、COCO-Stuff10K和Pascal-Context等多个数据集上实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: ECAC通过动态调整分类器，有效解决了语义分割中的类别分布差异和类别不平衡问题，提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Prevalent semantic segmentation methods generally adopt a vanilla classifier
to categorize each pixel into specific classes.
  Although such a classifier learns global information from the training data,
this information is represented by a set of fixed parameters (weights and
biases).
  However, each image has a different class distribution, which prevents the
classifier from addressing the unique characteristics of individual images.
  At the dataset level, class imbalance leads to segmentation results being
biased towards majority classes, limiting the model's effectiveness in
identifying and segmenting minority class regions.
  In this paper, we propose an Extended Context-Aware Classifier (ECAC) that
dynamically adjusts the classifier using global (dataset-level) and local
(image-level) contextual information.
  Specifically, we leverage a memory bank to learn dataset-level contextual
information of each class, incorporating the class-specific contextual
information from the current image to improve the classifier for precise pixel
labeling.
  Additionally, a teacher-student network paradigm is adopted, where the domain
expert (teacher network) dynamically adjusts contextual information with ground
truth and transfers knowledge to the student network.
  Comprehensive experiments illustrate that the proposed ECAC can achieve
state-of-the-art performance across several datasets, including ADE20K,
COCO-Stuff10K, and Pascal-Context.

Abstract: In recent years, test-time adaptive object detection has attracted increasing
attention due to its unique advantages in online domain adaptation, which
aligns more closely with real-world application scenarios. However, existing
approaches heavily rely on source-derived statistical characteristics while
making the strong assumption that the source and target domains share an
identical category space. In this paper, we propose the first foundation
model-powered test-time adaptive object detection method that eliminates the
need for source data entirely and overcomes traditional closed-set limitations.
Specifically, we design a Multi-modal Prompt-based Mean-Teacher framework for
vision-language detector-driven test-time adaptation, which incorporates text
and visual prompt tuning to adapt both language and vision representation
spaces on the test data in a parameter-efficient manner. Correspondingly, we
propose a Test-time Warm-start strategy tailored for the visual prompts to
effectively preserve the representation capability of the vision branch.
Furthermore, to guarantee high-quality pseudo-labels in every test batch, we
maintain an Instance Dynamic Memory (IDM) module that stores high-quality
pseudo-labels from previous test samples, and propose two novel
strategies-Memory Enhancement and Memory Hallucination-to leverage IDM's
high-quality instances for enhancing original predictions and hallucinating
images without available pseudo-labels, respectively. Extensive experiments on
cross-corruption and cross-dataset benchmarks demonstrate that our method
consistently outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods, and can adapt to
arbitrary cross-domain and cross-category target data. Code is available at

a transformative phase characterized by digitization and heightened
intelligence. Concurrently, the global paradigm shift caused by the Covid-19
pandemic has catalyzed the evolution of e-learning, accentuating its

Conclusion: U-CAN框架成功实现了无需干净数据的高质量点云去噪，其一致性约束具有通用性，可扩展到2D图像去噪领域。

Abstract: Point clouds captured by scanning sensors are often perturbed by noise, which
have a highly negative impact on downstream tasks (e.g. surface reconstruction
and shape understanding). Previous works mostly focus on training neural
networks with noisy-clean point cloud pairs for learning denoising priors,
which requires extensively manual efforts. In this work, we introduce U-CAN, an
Unsupervised framework for point cloud denoising with Consistency-Aware
Noise2Noise matching. Specifically, we leverage a neural network to infer a
multi-step denoising path for each point of a shape or scene with a noise to
noise matching scheme. We achieve this by a novel loss which enables
statistical reasoning on multiple noisy point cloud observations. We further
introduce a novel constraint on the denoised geometry consistency for learning
consistency-aware denoising patterns. We justify that the proposed constraint
is a general term which is not limited to 3D domain and can also contribute to
the area of 2D image denoising. Our evaluations under the widely used
benchmarks in point cloud denoising, upsampling and image denoising show
significant improvement over the state-of-the-art unsupervised methods, where
U-CAN also produces comparable results with the supervised methods.

Result: 在DiLiGenT基准测试中，MSF-Net在表面法线估计精度上显著超越先前最先进方法。

Conclusion: MSF-Net通过改进多阶段特征提取和交互，有效提升了光度立体视觉的表面法线估计精度。

Abstract: Photometric stereo is a technique aimed at determining surface normals
through the utilization of shading cues derived from images taken under
different lighting conditions. However, existing learning-based approaches
often fail to accurately capture features at multiple stages and do not
adequately promote interaction between these features. Consequently, these
models tend to extract redundant features, especially in areas with intricate
details such as wrinkles and edges. To tackle these issues, we propose MSF-Net,
a novel framework for extracting information at multiple stages, paired with
selective update strategy, aiming to extract high-quality feature information,
which is critical for accurate normal construction. Additionally, we have
developed a feature fusion module to improve the interplay among different
features. Experimental results on the DiLiGenT benchmark show that our proposed
MSF-Net significantly surpasses previous state-of-the-art methods in the
accuracy of surface normal estimation.

Abstract: Source-Free Domain Adaptation (SFDA) is emerging as a compelling solution for
medical image segmentation under privacy constraints, yet current approaches
often ignore sample difficulty and struggle with noisy supervision under domain
shift. We present a new SFDA framework that leverages Hard Sample Selection and
Denoised Patch Mixing to progressively align target distributions. First,
unlabeled images are partitioned into reliable and unreliable subsets through
entropy-similarity analysis, allowing adaptation to start from easy samples and
gradually incorporate harder ones. Next, pseudo-labels are refined via Monte
Carlo-based denoising masks, which suppress unreliable pixels and stabilize
training. Finally, intra- and inter-domain objectives mix patches between
subsets, transferring reliable semantics while mitigating noise. Experiments on
benchmark datasets show consistent gains over prior SFDA and UDA methods,
delivering more accurate boundary delineation and achieving state-of-the-art
Dice and ASSD scores. Our study highlights the importance of progressive
adaptation and denoised supervision for robust segmentation under domain shift.

Conclusion: 该方法实现了更稳健的ODE学习，同时保持了真实图像的分布，为高效高质量的图像生成提供了新途径。

Abstract: Rectified flow is a generative model that learns smooth transport mappings
between two distributions through an ordinary differential equation (ODE).
Unlike diffusion-based generative models, which require costly numerical
integration of a generative ODE to sample images with state-of-the-art quality,
rectified flow uses an iterative process called reflow to learn smooth and
straight ODE paths. This allows for relatively simple and efficient generation
of high-quality images. However, rectified flow still faces several challenges.
1) The reflow process requires a large number of generative pairs to preserve
the target distribution, leading to significant computational costs. 2) Since
the model is typically trained using only generated image pairs, its
performance heavily depends on the 1-rectified flow model, causing it to become
biased towards the generated data.
  In this work, we experimentally expose the limitations of the original
rectified flow and propose a novel approach that incorporates real images into
the training process. By preserving the ODE paths for real images, our method
effectively reduces reliance on large amounts of generated data. Instead, we
demonstrate that the reflow process can be conducted efficiently using a much
smaller set of generated and real images. In CIFAR-10, we achieved
significantly better FID scores, not only in one-step generation but also in
full-step simulations, while using only of the generative pairs compared to the
original method. Furthermore, our approach induces straighter paths and avoids
saturation on generated images during reflow, leading to more robust ODE
learning while preserving the distribution of real images.

Abstract: Expressions are fundamental to conveying human emotions. With the rapid
advancement of AI-generated content (AIGC), realistic and expressive 3D facial
animation has become increasingly crucial. Despite recent progress in
speech-driven lip-sync for talking-face animation, generating emotionally
expressive talking faces remains underexplored. A major obstacle is the
scarcity of real emotional 3D talking-face datasets due to the high cost of
data capture. To address this, we model facial animation driven by both speech
and emotion as a linear additive problem. Leveraging a 3D talking-face dataset
with neutral expressions (VOCAset) and a dataset of 3D expression sequences
(Florence4D), we jointly learn a set of blendshapes driven by speech and
emotion. We introduce a sparsity constraint loss to encourage disentanglement
between the two types of blendshapes while allowing the model to capture
inherent secondary cross-domain deformations present in the training data. The
learned blendshapes can be further mapped to the expression and jaw pose
parameters of the FLAME model, enabling the animation of 3D Gaussian avatars.
Qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate that our method naturally
generates talking faces with specified expressions while maintaining accurate
lip synchronization. Perceptual studies further show that our approach achieves
superior emotional expressivity compared to existing methods, without
compromising lip-sync quality.

Abstract: Recent advances in deep generative models have made it easier to manipulate
face videos, raising significant concerns about their potential misuse for
fraud and misinformation. Existing detectors often perform well in in-domain
scenarios but fail to generalize across diverse manipulation techniques due to
their reliance on forgery-specific artifacts. In this work, we introduce
DeepShield, a novel deepfake detection framework that balances local
sensitivity and global generalization to improve robustness across unseen
forgeries. DeepShield enhances the CLIP-ViT encoder through two key components:
Local Patch Guidance (LPG) and Global Forgery Diversification (GFD). LPG
applies spatiotemporal artifact modeling and patch-wise supervision to capture
fine-grained inconsistencies often overlooked by global models. GFD introduces
domain feature augmentation, leveraging domain-bridging and boundary-expanding
feature generation to synthesize diverse forgeries, mitigating overfitting and
enhancing cross-domain adaptability. Through the integration of novel local and
global analysis for deepfake detection, DeepShield outperforms state-of-the-art
methods in cross-dataset and cross-manipulation evaluations, achieving superior
robustness against unseen deepfake attacks.

Result: 模型在四个景观中均取得良好分类精度，FT-UNetFormer表现最佳（平均IoU 0.74；平均F1分数0.84），森林和线性类别结果良好，但斑块和单树类别分类存在挑战。

Conclusion: 研究强调了空间上下文理解在TOF制图中的重要性，泛化实验表明需要区域多样化的训练数据以确保可靠的大规模制图。

Abstract: Trees Outside Forests (TOF) play an important role in agricultural landscapes
by supporting biodiversity, sequestering carbon, and regulating microclimates.
Yet, most studies have treated TOF as a single class or relied on rigid
rule-based thresholds, limiting ecological interpretation and adaptability
across regions. To address this, we evaluate deep learning for TOF
classification using a newly generated dataset and high-resolution aerial
imagery from four agricultural landscapes in Germany. Specifically, we compare
convolutional neural networks (CNNs), vision transformers, and hybrid
CNN-transformer models across six semantic segmentation architectures (ABCNet,
LSKNet, FT-UNetFormer, DC-Swin, BANet, and U-Net) to map four categories of
woody vegetation: Forest, Patch, Linear, and Tree, derived from previous
studies and governmental products. Overall, the models achieved good
classification accuracy across the four landscapes, with the FT-UNetFormer
performing best (mean Intersection-over-Union 0.74; mean F1 score 0.84),
underscoring the importance of spatial context understanding in TOF mapping and
classification. Our results show good results for Forest and Linear class and
reveal challenges particularly in classifying complex structures with high edge
density, notably the Patch and Tree class. Our generalization experiments
highlight the need for regionally diverse training data to ensure reliable
large-scale mapping. The dataset and code are openly available at

Abstract: Real-time object detection has achieved substantial progress through
meticulously designed architectures and optimization strategies. However, the
pursuit of high-speed inference via lightweight network designs often leads to
degraded feature representation, which hinders further performance improvements
and practical on-device deployment. In this paper, we propose a cost-effective
and highly adaptable distillation framework that harnesses the rapidly evolving
capabilities of Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) to enhance lightweight object
detectors. Given the significant architectural and learning objective
disparities between VFMs and resource-constrained detectors, achieving stable
and task-aligned semantic transfer is challenging. To address this, on one
hand, we introduce a Deep Semantic Injector (DSI) module that facilitates the
integration of high-level representations from VFMs into the deep layers of the
detector. On the other hand, we devise a Gradient-guided Adaptive Modulation
(GAM) strategy, which dynamically adjusts the intensity of semantic transfer
based on gradient norm ratios. Without increasing deployment and inference
overhead, our approach painlessly delivers striking and consistent performance
gains across diverse DETR-based models, underscoring its practical utility for
real-time detection. Our new model family, RT-DETRv4, achieves state-of-the-art
results on COCO, attaining AP scores of 49.7/53.5/55.4/57.0 at corresponding
speeds of 273/169/124/78 FPS.

Motivation: 现有方法依赖启发式或可学习的视觉分组，而LangHOPS旨在语言空间中构建对象-部件层次结构，利用MLLM的丰富知识和推理能力。

Method: 将MLLM集成到对象-部件解析流程中，利用其知识链接多层次概念，采用语言锚定的层次结构和MLLM驱动的部件查询优化策略。

Result: 在PartImageNet数据集上，LangHOPS比之前方法在域内和跨数据集上分别提升5.5%和4.8% AP，在ADE20K的零样本分割上提升2.5% mIOU。

Conclusion: 语言锚定的层次结构和MLLM驱动的部件查询优化策略有效，LangHOPS在开放词汇对象-部件实例分割任务上表现出色。

Abstract: We propose LangHOPS, the first Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) based
framework for open-vocabulary object-part instance segmentation. Given an
image, LangHOPS can jointly detect and segment hierarchical object and part
instances from open-vocabulary candidate categories. Unlike prior approaches
that rely on heuristic or learnable visual grouping, our approach grounds
object-part hierarchies in language space. It integrates the MLLM into the
object-part parsing pipeline to leverage its rich knowledge and reasoning
capabilities, and link multi-granularity concepts within the hierarchies. We
evaluate LangHOPS across multiple challenging scenarios, including in-domain
and cross-dataset object-part instance segmentation, and zero-shot semantic
segmentation. LangHOPS achieves state-of-the-art results, surpassing previous
methods by 5.5% Average Precision (AP) (in-domain) and 4.8% (cross-dataset) on
the PartImageNet dataset and by 2.5% mIOU on unseen object parts in ADE20K
(zero-shot). Ablation studies further validate the effectiveness of the
language-grounded hierarchy and MLLM driven part query refinement strategy. The
code will be released here.

TL;DR: 提出了DPTM框架，利用扩散模型通过渐进式目标操作生成伪目标域，解决源自由域适应中源-目标域差异大的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SFDA方法受限于源-目标域差异，非生成方法在大域差异下伪标签不可靠，生成方法因创建伪源数据时域差异扩大而性能下降。

Method: 将目标样本分为可信集和非可信集，对非可信集样本使用潜在扩散模型进行语义转换，同时保持目标分布，并通过渐进式精炼机制迭代减小伪目标域与真实目标域的差异。

Result: 在四个主流SFDA基准数据集上大幅超越现有方法，在源-目标差距大的场景下性能提升高达18.6%。

Conclusion: DPTM通过扩散驱动的渐进式目标操作有效解决了SFDA中的域差异问题，实现了最先进的性能。

Abstract: Source-free domain adaptation (SFDA) is a challenging task that tackles
domain shifts using only a pre-trained source model and unlabeled target data.
Existing SFDA methods are restricted by the fundamental limitation of
source-target domain discrepancy. Non-generation SFDA methods suffer from
unreliable pseudo-labels in challenging scenarios with large domain
discrepancies, while generation-based SFDA methods are evidently degraded due
to enlarged domain discrepancies in creating pseudo-source data. To address
this limitation, we propose a novel generation-based framework named
Diffusion-Driven Progressive Target Manipulation (DPTM) that leverages
unlabeled target data as references to reliably generate and progressively
refine a pseudo-target domain for SFDA. Specifically, we divide the target
samples into a trust set and a non-trust set based on the reliability of
pseudo-labels to sufficiently and reliably exploit their information. For
samples from the non-trust set, we develop a manipulation strategy to
semantically transform them into the newly assigned categories, while
simultaneously maintaining them in the target distribution via a latent
diffusion model. Furthermore, we design a progressive refinement mechanism that
progressively reduces the domain discrepancy between the pseudo-target domain
and the real target domain via iterative refinement. Experimental results
demonstrate that DPTM outperforms existing methods by a large margin and
achieves state-of-the-art performance on four prevailing SFDA benchmark
datasets with different scales. Remarkably, DPTM can significantly enhance the
performance by up to 18.6% in scenarios with large source-target gaps.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常分别解决视线目标检测和视线跟随任务，且预测依赖于头部相关先验知识，需要辅助网络提取头部位置，限制了系统的联合优化和实际应用。

Method: 使用扩展的特定-通用-特定特征提取器，包含共享骨干网络和特定块；嵌入头部检测分支预测头部位置；提出基于头部的注意力机制融合感知特征和视线特征；引入注意力监督机制加速视线热图学习；提出新的评估指标mSoC。

Conclusion: GaTector+通过统一框架成功解决了视线目标检测和视线跟随任务，消除了对头部先验知识的依赖，提高了系统的实用性和性能。

Abstract: Gaze object detection and gaze following are fundamental tasks for
interpreting human gaze behavior or intent. However, most previous methods
usually solve these two tasks separately, and their prediction of gaze objects
and gaze following typically depend on head-related prior knowledge during both
the training phase and real-world deployment. This dependency necessitates an
auxiliary network to extract head location, thus precluding joint optimization
across the entire system and constraining the practical applicability. To this
end, we propose GaTector+, a unified framework for gaze object detection and
gaze following, which eliminates the dependence on the head-related priors
during inference. Specifically, GaTector+ uses an expanded
specific-general-specific feature extractor that leverages a shared backbone,
which extracts general features for gaze following and object detection using
the shared backbone while using specific blocks before and after the shared
backbone to better consider the specificity of each sub-task. To obtain
head-related knowledge without prior information, we first embed a head
detection branch to predict the head of each person. Then, before regressing
the gaze point, a head-based attention mechanism is proposed to fuse the sense
feature and gaze feature with the help of head location. Since the
suboptimization of the gaze point heatmap leads to the performance bottleneck,
we propose an attention supervision mechanism to accelerate the learning of the
gaze heatmap. Finally, we propose a novel evaluation metric, mean Similarity
over Candidates (mSoC), for gaze object detection, which is more sensitive to
variations between bounding boxes. The experimental results on multiple
benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our model in both gaze
object detection and gaze following tasks.

Motivation: 传统紧凑光学系统难以在整个景深范围内保持RGB清晰度，而纯软件单目深度估计依赖不可靠的语义先验。现有深度光学系统在制造复杂度和色差方面存在权衡。

Method: 设计仿生全球面单中心透镜，建立物理前向模型生成合成数据集，开发双头多尺度重建网络，共享编码器联合恢复全聚焦图像和深度图。

Result: 深度估计达到Abs Rel 0.026和RMSE 0.130，图像恢复达到SSIM 0.960和LPIPS 0.082，显著优于纯软件方法和其他深度光学系统。

Conclusion: 仿生全球面光学与联合重建算法的结合是解决高性能紧凑RGBD成像内在挑战的有效策略。

Abstract: Achieving high-fidelity, compact RGBD imaging presents a dual challenge:
conventional compact optics struggle with RGB sharpness across the entire
depth-of-field, while software-only Monocular Depth Estimation (MDE) is an
ill-posed problem reliant on unreliable semantic priors. While deep optics with
elements like DOEs can encode depth, they introduce trade-offs in fabrication
complexity and chromatic aberrations, compromising simplicity. To address this,
we first introduce a novel bio-inspired all-spherical monocentric lens, around
which we build the Bionic Monocentric Imaging (BMI) framework, a holistic
co-design. This optical design naturally encodes depth into its depth-varying
Point Spread Functions (PSFs) without requiring complex diffractive or freeform
elements. We establish a rigorous physically-based forward model to generate a
synthetic dataset by precisely simulating the optical degradation process. This
simulation pipeline is co-designed with a dual-head, multi-scale reconstruction
network that employs a shared encoder to jointly recover a high-fidelity
All-in-Focus (AiF) image and a precise depth map from a single coded capture.
Extensive experiments validate the state-of-the-art performance of the proposed
framework. In depth estimation, the method attains an Abs Rel of 0.026 and an
RMSE of 0.130, markedly outperforming leading software-only approaches and
other deep optics systems. For image restoration, the system achieves an SSIM
of 0.960 and a perceptual LPIPS score of 0.082, thereby confirming a superior
balance between image fidelity and depth accuracy. This study illustrates that
the integration of bio-inspired, fully spherical optics with a joint
reconstruction algorithm constitutes an effective strategy for addressing the
intrinsic challenges in high-performance compact RGBD imaging. Source code will
be publicly available at https://github.com/ZongxiYu-ZJU/BMI.

Motivation: 解决小样本目标检测中基础类偏差和校准不稳定问题，当只有少量新类样本可用时

Method: 在可学习的身份初始化投影空间中维护仅支持的原型，可选地应用原型条件RoI对齐减少几何不匹配，通过EMA更新适应原型，采用best-of-K匹配方案和温度缩放融合

Result: 在VOC FSOD和GFSOD基准测试中，PDA一致提升了新类性能，对基础类影响最小，计算开销可忽略

Conclusion: PDA作为轻量级插件，有效提升了小样本目标检测的性能，特别是新类检测能力

Abstract: Few-shot object detection (FSOD) often suffers from base-class bias and
unstable calibration when only a few novel samples are available. We propose
Prototype-Driven Alignment (PDA), a lightweight, plug-in metric head for DeFRCN
that provides a prototype-based "second opinion" complementary to the linear
classifier. PDA maintains support-only prototypes in a learnable
identity-initialized projection space and optionally applies
prototype-conditioned RoI alignment to reduce geometric mismatch. During
fine-tuning, prototypes can be adapted via exponential moving average(EMA)
updates on labeled foreground RoIs-without introducing class-specific
parameters-and are frozen at inference to ensure strict protocol compliance.
PDA employs a best-of-K matching scheme to capture intra-class multi-modality
and temperature-scaled fusion to combine metric similarities with detector
logits. Experiments on VOC FSOD and GFSOD benchmarks show that PDA consistently
improves novel-class performance with minimal impact on base classes and
negligible computational overhead.

Motivation: 现有工作在资源受限的边缘设备上进行实时多模态推理时，往往忽略了感知动态与模型执行之间的紧密耦合，以及复杂的模态间依赖关系。

Method: 将推理过程分解为细粒度的感知和编码单元，采用流水线设计进行增量计算；引入时间聚合模块捕获时序动态；包含自适应多模态配置优化器和跨模态推测跳过机制。

Result: 在两个公共多模态数据集和真实无人机测试平台上评估，MMEdge显著降低了端到端延迟，同时在不同系统和数据动态下保持高任务精度。

Conclusion: MMEdge通过流水线感知和编码设计，有效解决了边缘设备上多模态推理的延迟和精度挑战，为实时应用提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Real-time multimodal inference on resource-constrained edge devices is
essential for applications such as autonomous driving, human-computer
interaction, and mobile health. However, prior work often overlooks the tight
coupling between sensing dynamics and model execution, as well as the complex
inter-modality dependencies. In this paper, we propose MMEdge, an new on-device
multi-modal inference framework based on pipelined sensing and encoding.
Instead of waiting for complete sensor inputs, MMEdge decomposes the entire
inference process into a sequence of fine-grained sensing and encoding units,
allowing computation to proceed incrementally as data arrive. MMEdge also
introduces a lightweight but effective temporal aggregation module that
captures rich temporal dynamics across different pipelined units to maintain
accuracy performance. Such pipelined design also opens up opportunities for
fine-grained cross-modal optimization and early decision-making during
inference. To further enhance system performance under resource variability and
input data complexity, MMEdge incorporates an adaptive multimodal configuration
optimizer that dynamically selects optimal sensing and model configurations for
each modality under latency constraints, and a cross-modal speculative skipping
mechanism that bypasses future units of slower modalities when early
predictions reach sufficient confidence. We evaluate MMEdge using two public
multimodal datasets and deploy it on a real-world unmanned aerial vehicle
(UAV)-based multimodal testbed. The results show that MMEdge significantly
reduces end-to-end latency while maintaining high task accuracy across various
system and data dynamics.

Conclusion: StreamingCoT数据集解决了当前VideoQA数据集在时间动态性和推理过程标注方面的核心问题，推动了流媒体视频理解和复杂推理能力的发展。

Abstract: The rapid growth of streaming video applications demands multimodal models
with enhanced capabilities for temporal dynamics understanding and complex
reasoning. However, current Video Question Answering (VideoQA) datasets suffer
from two critical limitations: 1) Static annotation mechanisms fail to capture
the evolving nature of answers in temporal video streams, and 2) The absence of
explicit reasoning process annotations restricts model interpretability and
logical deduction capabilities. To address these challenges, We introduce
StreamingCoT, the first dataset explicitly designed for temporally evolving
reasoning in streaming VideoQA and multimodal Chain-of-Thought (CoT) tasks. Our
framework first establishes a dynamic hierarchical annotation architecture that
generates per-second dense descriptions and constructs temporally-dependent
semantic segments through similarity fusion, paired with question-answer sets
constrained by temporal evolution patterns. We further propose an explicit
reasoning chain generation paradigm that extracts spatiotemporal objects via
keyframe semantic alignment, derives object state transition-based reasoning
paths using large language models, and ensures logical coherence through
human-verified validation. This dataset establishes a foundation for advancing
research in streaming video understanding, complex temporal reasoning, and
multimodal inference. Our StreamingCoT and its construction toolkit can be

Motivation: 现有的半监督3D动作识别方法中，基于聚类和边界选择策略的主动学习方法可能选择最具代表性的样本，但这些样本不一定对动作识别器最有用，因为模型可能已从相似样本中获得了相关知识。

Method: 将半监督3D动作识别重新构建为马尔可夫决策过程，训练信息样本选择模型来智能指导骨骼序列的选择；将状态-动作对从欧几里得空间投影到双曲空间以增强表示能力；引入元调优策略加速实际部署。

Conclusion: 通过将半监督3D动作识别建模为MDP问题，并在双曲空间中增强表示，提出的方法能够更有效地选择信息量最大的样本进行标注，提高了识别性能。

Abstract: Skeleton-based human action recognition aims to classify human skeletal
sequences, which are spatiotemporal representations of actions, into predefined
categories. To reduce the reliance on costly annotations of skeletal sequences
while maintaining competitive recognition accuracy, the task of 3D Action
Recognition with Limited Training Samples, also known as semi-supervised 3D
Action Recognition, has been proposed. In addition, active learning, which aims
to proactively select the most informative unlabeled samples for annotation,
has been explored in semi-supervised 3D Action Recognition for training sample
selection. Specifically, researchers adopt an encoder-decoder framework to
embed skeleton sequences into a latent space, where clustering information,
combined with a margin-based selection strategy using a multi-head mechanism,
is utilized to identify the most informative sequences in the unlabeled set for
annotation. However, the most representative skeleton sequences may not
necessarily be the most informative for the action recognizer, as the model may
have already acquired similar knowledge from previously seen skeleton samples.
To solve it, we reformulate Semi-supervised 3D action recognition via active
learning from a novel perspective by casting it as a Markov Decision Process
(MDP). Built upon the MDP framework and its training paradigm, we train an
informative sample selection model to intelligently guide the selection of
skeleton sequences for annotation. To enhance the representational capacity of
the factors in the state-action pairs within our method, we project them from
Euclidean space to hyperbolic space. Furthermore, we introduce a meta tuning
strategy to accelerate the deployment of our method in real-world scenarios.
Extensive experiments on three 3D action recognition benchmarks demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method.

Conclusion: 基于放射组学的伪标签方法在冠状动脉钙化评分中具有实用价值，为无标注数据场景提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Coronary artery calcium (CAC) scoring plays a crucial role in the early
detection and risk stratification of coronary artery disease (CAD). In this
study, we focus on non-contrast coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA)
scans, which are commonly used for early calcification detection in clinical
settings. To address the challenge of limited annotated data, we propose a
radiomics-based pipeline that leverages pseudo-labeling to generate training
labels, thereby eliminating the need for expert-defined segmentations.
Additionally, we explore the use of pretrained foundation models, specifically
CT-FM and RadImageNet, to extract image features, which are then used with
traditional classifiers. We compare the performance of these deep learning
features with that of radiomics features. Evaluation is conducted on a clinical
CCTA dataset comprising 182 patients, where individuals are classified into two
groups: zero versus non-zero calcium scores. We further investigate the impact
of training on non-contrast datasets versus combined contrast and non-contrast
datasets, with testing performed only on non contrast scans. Results show that
radiomics-based models significantly outperform CNN-derived embeddings from
foundation models (achieving 84% accuracy and p<0.05), despite the
unavailability of expert annotations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的全局提示调优在异构客户端上泛化能力差，而个性化调优容易过拟合本地数据且缺乏泛化能力。需要一种既能泛化又能个性化的联邦提示调优方法。

Method: 提出CCMP方法，结合全局共享提示和类特定提示，根据全局类原型和客户端类先验自适应组合提示，实现逐样本个性化而无需存储客户端相关参数。

Result: 在CIFAR-100、TinyImageNet、DomainNet和iNaturalist数据集上的评估表明，PEP-FedPT在各种数据异构场景下均优于现有最优基线方法。

Conclusion: PEP-FedPT为视觉Transformer的高效且可泛化的联邦提示调优建立了坚实基础。

Abstract: Visual Prompt Tuning (VPT) of pre-trained Vision Transformers (ViTs) has
proven highly effective as a parameter-efficient fine-tuning technique for
adapting large models to downstream tasks with limited data. Its parameter
efficiency makes it particularly suitable for Federated Learning (FL), where
both communication and computation budgets are often constrained. However,
global prompt tuning struggles to generalize across heterogeneous clients,
while personalized tuning overfits to local data and lacks generalization. We
propose PEP-FedPT (Prompt Estimation from Prototypes for Federated Prompt
Tuning), a unified framework designed to achieve both generalization and
personalization in federated prompt tuning of ViTs. Within this framework, we
introduce the novel Class-Contextualized Mixed Prompt (CCMP) - based on
class-specific prompts maintained alongside a globally shared prompt. For each
input, CCMP adaptively combines class-specific prompts using weights derived
from global class prototypes and client class priors. This approach enables
per-sample prompt personalization without storing client-dependent trainable
parameters. The prompts are collaboratively optimized via traditional federated
averaging technique on the same. Comprehensive evaluations on CIFAR-100,
TinyImageNet, DomainNet, and iNaturalist datasets demonstrate that PEP-FedPT
consistently surpasses the state-of-the-art baselines under diverse data
heterogeneity scenarios, establishing a strong foundation for efficient and
generalizable federated prompt tuning of Vision Transformers.

back by the absence of high-quality training and evaluation data. We introduce
a new evaluation dataset, i-CIR, which, unlike existing datasets, focuses on an
instance-level class definition. The goal is to retrieve images that contain
the same particular object as the visual query, presented under a variety of
modifications defined by textual queries. Its design and curation process keep
the dataset compact to facilitate future research, while maintaining its
challenge-comparable to retrieval among more than 40M random
distractors-through a semi-automated selection of hard negatives.
  To overcome the challenge of obtaining clean, diverse, and suitable training
data, we leverage pre-trained vision-and-language models (VLMs) in a
training-free approach called BASIC. The method separately estimates
query-image-to-image and query-text-to-image similarities, performing late
fusion to upweight images that satisfy both queries, while down-weighting those
that exhibit high similarity with only one of the two. Each individual
similarity is further improved by a set of components that are simple and
intuitive. BASIC sets a new state of the art on i-CIR but also on existing CIR
datasets that follow a semantic-level class definition. Project page:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出CoherentAD方法，通过生成多个候选描述并进行自回归选择，创建连贯的音频描述序列，解决了现有方法生成独立描述导致的重复和不连贯问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的自动音频描述方法通常独立生成每个描述，导致描述序列重复且不连贯，无法帮助视障听众形成连续的画面理解。

Method: CoherentAD是一种无需训练的方法，首先为每个时间间隔生成多个候选描述，然后通过自回归选择机制在整个序列中选择最连贯和最有信息量的描述组合。

Result: 该方法生成的音频描述序列在叙事理解方面表现更好，优于依赖独立生成的先前方法。

Conclusion: 通过序列级选择和评估，CoherentAD能够产生更连贯的音频描述，提升对视障听众的视频理解体验。

Abstract: Audio Descriptions (ADs) convey essential on-screen information, allowing
visually impaired audiences to follow videos. To be effective, ADs must form a
coherent sequence that helps listeners to visualise the unfolding scene, rather
than describing isolated moments. However, most automatic methods generate each
AD independently, often resulting in repetitive, incoherent descriptions. To
address this, we propose a training-free method, CoherentAD, that first
generates multiple candidate descriptions for each AD time interval, and then
performs auto-regressive selection across the sequence to form a coherent and
informative narrative. To evaluate AD sequences holistically, we introduce a
sequence-level metric, StoryRecall, which measures how well the predicted ADs
convey the ground truth narrative, alongside repetition metrics that capture
the redundancy across consecutive AD outputs. Our method produces coherent AD
sequences with enhanced narrative understanding, outperforming prior approaches
that rely on independent generations.

TL;DR: SPADE：一种稀疏自适应深度估计器，结合预训练相对深度估计器和稀疏深度先验，为水下基础设施检查生成密集的度量尺度深度图


<details>

Motivation: 水下基础设施检查面临恶劣海洋环境的挑战，当前依赖人类潜水员或远程操作车辆存在感知和操作限制，特别是在复杂结构或浑浊水域中。增强水下车辆的空间感知能力对于降低驾驶风险和实现更高自主性至关重要

Method: 提出两阶段方法：首先用稀疏深度点缩放相对深度图，然后使用提出的级联卷积-可变形Transformer块来细化最终度量预测

Result: 该方法在准确性和泛化性上优于最先进的基线方法，在嵌入式硬件上以超过15 FPS的速度高效运行

Conclusion: SPADE方法有望支持实用的水下检查和干预应用，已提交至IEEE海洋工程期刊AUV 2026特刊

Abstract: Underwater infrastructure requires frequent inspection and maintenance due to
harsh marine conditions. Current reliance on human divers or remotely operated
vehicles is limited by perceptual and operational challenges, especially around
complex structures or in turbid water. Enhancing the spatial awareness of
underwater vehicles is key to reducing piloting risks and enabling greater
autonomy. To address these challenges, we present SPADE: SParsity Adaptive
Depth Estimator, a monocular depth estimation pipeline that combines
pre-trained relative depth estimator with sparse depth priors to produce dense,
metric scale depth maps. Our two-stage approach first scales the relative depth
map with the sparse depth points, then refines the final metric prediction with
our proposed Cascade Conv-Deformable Transformer blocks. Our approach achieves
improved accuracy and generalisation over state-of-the-art baselines and runs
efficiently at over 15 FPS on embedded hardware, promising to support practical
underwater inspection and intervention. This work has been submitted to IEEE
Journal of Oceanic Engineering Special Issue of AUV 2026.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究评估了基于UNet架构的肝脏肿瘤分割方法，发现ResNet骨干网络结合CBAM注意力模块的UNet3+模型在多种评估指标上表现最佳，优于Transformer和Mamba架构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多期相增强CT中肝脏结构分割在计算机辅助诊断和治疗规划中至关重要，需要探索不同骨干网络在肝脏肿瘤分割中的性能。

Method: 从原始UNet扩展到UNet3+，评估ResNet、Transformer和Mamba三种骨干网络，并引入注意力机制（特别是CBAM模块）来提升分割质量。

Result: ResNetUNet3+ with CBAM取得了最佳性能：Dice分数0.755、IoU 0.662、HD95距离77.911、准确率0.925、特异性0.926，边界描绘最精确。

Conclusion: 经典ResNet架构结合现代注意力模块在医学图像分割任务中仍具有强大竞争力，为临床实践中肝脏肿瘤检测提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Segmentation of liver structures in multi-phase contrast-enhanced computed
tomography (CECT) plays a crucial role in computer-aided diagnosis and
treatment planning for liver diseases, including tumor detection. In this
study, we investigate the performance of UNet-based architectures for liver
tumor segmentation, starting from the original UNet and extending to UNet3+
with various backbone networks. We evaluate ResNet, Transformer-based, and
State-space (Mamba) backbones, all initialized with pretrained weights.
Surprisingly, despite the advances in modern architecture, ResNet-based models
consistently outperform Transformer- and Mamba-based alternatives across
multiple evaluation metrics. To further improve segmentation quality, we
introduce attention mechanisms into the backbone and observe that incorporating
the Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM) yields the best performance.
ResNetUNet3+ with CBAM module not only produced the best overlap metrics with a
Dice score of 0.755 and IoU of 0.662, but also achieved the most precise
boundary delineation, evidenced by the lowest HD95 distance of 77.911. The
model's superiority was further cemented by its leading overall accuracy of
0.925 and specificity of 0.926, showcasing its robust capability in accurately
identifying both lesion and healthy tissue. To further enhance
interpretability, Grad-CAM visualizations were employed to highlight the
region's most influential predictions, providing insights into its
decision-making process. These findings demonstrate that classical ResNet
architecture, when combined with modern attention modules, remain highly
competitive for medical image segmentation tasks, offering a promising
direction for liver tumor detection in clinical practice.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RegionE是一个自适应区域感知生成框架，通过区分图像中的编辑区域和未编辑区域，对未编辑区域使用单步预测，对编辑区域使用局部迭代去噪，显著加速基于指令的图像编辑任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于指令的图像编辑模型在整个图像上采用统一的生成过程，没有考虑编辑区域和未编辑区域在生成难度和计算冗余上的显著差异，导致效率低下。

Method: 1) 自适应区域划分：基于最终估计结果与参考图像的差异划分编辑和未编辑区域；2) 区域感知生成：对未编辑区域用单步预测替代多步去噪，对编辑区域使用局部迭代去噪和区域指令KV缓存；3) 自适应速度衰减缓存：利用相邻时间步的速度相似性加速局部去噪。

Result: 在Step1X-Edit、FLUX.1 Kontext和Qwen-Image-Edit等先进IIE模型上，RegionE分别实现了2.57、2.41和2.06倍的加速，GPT-4o评估确认语义和感知保真度得到良好保持。

Conclusion: RegionE框架无需额外训练即可显著加速基于指令的图像编辑任务，同时保持编辑质量，证明了区域感知生成策略的有效性。

Abstract: Recently, instruction-based image editing (IIE) has received widespread
attention. In practice, IIE often modifies only specific regions of an image,
while the remaining areas largely remain unchanged. Although these two types of
regions differ significantly in generation difficulty and computational
redundancy, existing IIE models do not account for this distinction, instead
applying a uniform generation process across the entire image. This motivates
us to propose RegionE, an adaptive, region-aware generation framework that
accelerates IIE tasks without additional training. Specifically, the RegionE
framework consists of three main components: 1) Adaptive Region Partition. We
observed that the trajectory of unedited regions is straight, allowing for
multi-step denoised predictions to be inferred in a single step. Therefore, in
the early denoising stages, we partition the image into edited and unedited
regions based on the difference between the final estimated result and the
reference image. 2) Region-Aware Generation. After distinguishing the regions,
we replace multi-step denoising with one-step prediction for unedited areas.
For edited regions, the trajectory is curved, requiring local iterative
denoising. To improve the efficiency and quality of local iterative generation,
we propose the Region-Instruction KV Cache, which reduces computational cost
while incorporating global information. 3) Adaptive Velocity Decay Cache.
Observing that adjacent timesteps in edited regions exhibit strong velocity
similarity, we further propose an adaptive velocity decay cache to accelerate
the local denoising process. We applied RegionE to state-of-the-art IIE base
models, including Step1X-Edit, FLUX.1 Kontext, and Qwen-Image-Edit. RegionE
achieved acceleration factors of 2.57, 2.41, and 2.06. Evaluations by GPT-4o
confirmed that semantic and perceptual fidelity were well preserved.

TL;DR: Hawk是一种利用图像空间结构指导推测解码的方法，在保持图像质量和多样性的同时，将自回归图像生成模型的推理速度提升了1.71倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自回归图像生成模型虽然能产生高质量图像，但推理速度慢。推测解码在文本生成中已证明有效，但在图像生成中应用不足，主要挑战包括更大的采样空间和二维空间结构利用不充分。

Method: 提出Hawk方法，利用图像的空间结构指导推测模型进行更准确和高效的预测，解决了草稿模型与目标模型输出对齐困难的问题。

Result: 在多个文本到图像基准测试中，实现了1.71倍的速度提升，同时保持了图像保真度和多样性。

Conclusion: Hawk成功将推测解码应用于图像生成领域，通过利用空间结构显著加速了自回归模型的推理过程，为高效图像生成提供了新思路。

Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) image generation models are capable of producing
high-fidelity images but often suffer from slow inference due to their
inherently sequential, token-by-token decoding process. Speculative decoding,
which employs a lightweight draft model to approximate the output of a larger
AR model, has shown promise in accelerating text generation without
compromising quality. However, its application to image generation remains
largely underexplored. The challenges stem from a significantly larger sampling
space, which complicates the alignment between the draft and target model
outputs, coupled with the inadequate use of the two-dimensional spatial
structure inherent in images, thereby limiting the modeling of local
dependencies. To overcome these challenges, we introduce Hawk, a new approach
that harnesses the spatial structure of images to guide the speculative model
toward more accurate and efficient predictions. Experimental results on
multiple text-to-image benchmarks demonstrate a 1.71x speedup over standard AR
models, while preserving both image fidelity and diversity.

Abstract: Humans possess spatial reasoning abilities that enable them to understand
spaces through multimodal observations, such as vision and sound. Large
multimodal reasoning models extend these abilities by learning to perceive and
reason, showing promising performance across diverse spatial tasks. However,
systematic reviews and publicly available benchmarks for these models remain
limited. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of multimodal
spatial reasoning tasks with large models, categorizing recent progress in
multimodal large language models (MLLMs) and introducing open benchmarks for
evaluation. We begin by outlining general spatial reasoning, focusing on
post-training techniques, explainability, and architecture. Beyond classical 2D
tasks, we examine spatial relationship reasoning, scene and layout
understanding, as well as visual question answering and grounding in 3D space.
We also review advances in embodied AI, including vision-language navigation
and action models. Additionally, we consider emerging modalities such as audio
and egocentric video, which contribute to novel spatial understanding through
new sensors. We believe this survey establishes a solid foundation and offers
insights into the growing field of multimodal spatial reasoning. Updated

TL;DR: FreeArt3D是一个无需训练的铰接3D物体生成框架，通过将预训练的静态3D扩散模型重新用于铰接物体生成，将Score Distillation Sampling扩展到3D-to-4D领域，将铰接作为额外的生成维度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有铰接3D物体建模方法要么需要密集视角监督的优化重建流程，要么生成粗略几何近似且忽略表面纹理。虽然静态物体的开放世界3D生成取得了显著成功，但将这些方法扩展到铰接物体面临重大挑战。

Method: 利用预训练静态3D扩散模型作为形状先验，将Score Distillation Sampling扩展到3D-to-4D领域，将铰接作为额外生成维度。给定不同铰接状态下的几张图像，联合优化物体的几何、纹理和铰接参数。

Result: 生成高保真几何和纹理，准确预测底层运动学结构，在多样化物体类别上泛化良好。尽管采用逐实例优化范式，但能在几分钟内完成，在质量和多功能性上显著优于先前最先进方法。

Conclusion: FreeArt3D提供了一种无需任务特定训练或大规模铰接数据集的有效铰接3D物体生成解决方案，展示了将预训练静态3D模型重新用于铰接物体生成的可行性。

Abstract: Articulated 3D objects are central to many applications in robotics, AR/VR,
and animation. Recent approaches to modeling such objects either rely on
optimization-based reconstruction pipelines that require dense-view supervision
or on feed-forward generative models that produce coarse geometric
approximations and often overlook surface texture. In contrast, open-world 3D
generation of static objects has achieved remarkable success, especially with
the advent of native 3D diffusion models such as Trellis. However, extending
these methods to articulated objects by training native 3D diffusion models
poses significant challenges. In this work, we present FreeArt3D, a
training-free framework for articulated 3D object generation. Instead of
training a new model on limited articulated data, FreeArt3D repurposes a
pre-trained static 3D diffusion model (e.g., Trellis) as a powerful shape
prior. It extends Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) into the 3D-to-4D domain by
treating articulation as an additional generative dimension. Given a few images
captured in different articulation states, FreeArt3D jointly optimizes the
object's geometry, texture, and articulation parameters without requiring
task-specific training or access to large-scale articulated datasets. Our
method generates high-fidelity geometry and textures, accurately predicts
underlying kinematic structures, and generalizes well across diverse object
categories. Despite following a per-instance optimization paradigm, FreeArt3D
completes in minutes and significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art
approaches in both quality and versatility.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前生成式AI在视觉特效(VFX)创建方面面临挑战，主流方法采用"一个LoRA对应一个特效"的模式，资源消耗大且无法泛化到未见特效，限制了可扩展性和创作能力。

Method: 设计了上下文条件策略，通过参考视频提示模型；使用上下文注意力掩码精确解耦和注入关键特效属性；提出高效的单次特效适应机制，从单个用户提供的视频快速提升对困难未见特效的泛化能力。

Result: 实验表明该方法能有效模仿各类特效信息，并在域外特效上表现出优异的泛化性能。

Conclusion: VFXMaster为VFX视频生成提供了统一的解决方案，克服了现有方法的局限性，具有良好的可扩展性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Visual effects (VFX) are crucial to the expressive power of digital media,
yet their creation remains a major challenge for generative AI. Prevailing
methods often rely on the one-LoRA-per-effect paradigm, which is
resource-intensive and fundamentally incapable of generalizing to unseen
effects, thus limiting scalability and creation. To address this challenge, we
introduce VFXMaster, the first unified, reference-based framework for VFX video
generation. It recasts effect generation as an in-context learning task,
enabling it to reproduce diverse dynamic effects from a reference video onto
target content. In addition, it demonstrates remarkable generalization to
unseen effect categories. Specifically, we design an in-context conditioning
strategy that prompts the model with a reference example. An in-context
attention mask is designed to precisely decouple and inject the essential
effect attributes, allowing a single unified model to master the effect
imitation without information leakage. In addition, we propose an efficient
one-shot effect adaptation mechanism to boost generalization capability on
tough unseen effects from a single user-provided video rapidly. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method effectively imitates various categories
of effect information and exhibits outstanding generalization to out-of-domain
effects. To foster future research, we will release our code, models, and a
comprehensive dataset to the community.

Conclusion: GReF框架有效解决了重排序中的训练和效率问题，实现了高性能和实用性的平衡。

Abstract: In a multi-stage recommendation system, reranking plays a crucial role in
modeling intra-list correlations among items. A key challenge lies in exploring
optimal sequences within the combinatorial space of permutations. Recent
research follows a two-stage (generator-evaluator) paradigm, where a generator
produces multiple feasible sequences, and an evaluator selects the best one. In
practice, the generator is typically implemented as an autoregressive model.
However, these two-stage methods face two main challenges. First, the
separation of the generator and evaluator hinders end-to-end training. Second,
autoregressive generators suffer from inference efficiency. In this work, we
propose a Unified Generative Efficient Reranking Framework (GReF) to address
the two primary challenges. Specifically, we introduce Gen-Reranker, an
autoregressive generator featuring a bidirectional encoder and a dynamic
autoregressive decoder to generate causal reranking sequences. Subsequently, we
pre-train Gen-Reranker on the item exposure order for high-quality parameter
initialization. To eliminate the need for the evaluator while integrating
sequence-level evaluation during training for end-to-end optimization, we
propose post-training the model through Rerank-DPO. Moreover, for efficient
autoregressive inference, we introduce ordered multi-token prediction (OMTP),
which trains Gen-Reranker to simultaneously generate multiple future items
while preserving their order, ensuring practical deployment in real-time
recommender systems. Extensive offline experiments demonstrate that GReF
outperforms state-of-the-art reranking methods while achieving latency that is
nearly comparable to non-autoregressive models. Additionally, GReF has also
been deployed in a real-world video app Kuaishou with over 300 million daily
active users, significantly improving online recommendation quality.

Motivation: 现有卷积滤波器在序列推荐中主要依赖固定滤波器，难以捕获全局交互模式，通常需要补充自注意力机制。

Method: 受图信号处理启发，使用时间变异的图滤波器来捕获用户序列中位置依赖的时间变化，替代固定核和自注意力。

Result: 在六个公共基准测试中，TV-Rec平均优于最先进基线7.49%，同时减少了计算量并加速了推理。

Conclusion: 时间变异卷积滤波器能够有效捕获序列推荐中的复杂交互模式，无需自注意力即可实现更好的性能。

Abstract: Recently, convolutional filters have been increasingly adopted in sequential
recommendation for their ability to capture local sequential patterns. However,
most of these models complement convolutional filters with self-attention. This
is because convolutional filters alone, generally fixed filters, struggle to
capture global interactions necessary for accurate recommendation. We propose
Time-Variant Convolutional Filters for Sequential Recommendation (TV-Rec), a
model inspired by graph signal processing, where time-variant graph filters
capture position-dependent temporal variations in user sequences. By replacing
both fixed kernels and self-attention with time-variant filters, TV-Rec
achieves higher expressive power and better captures complex interaction
patterns in user behavior. This design not only eliminates the need for
self-attention but also reduces computation while accelerating inference.
Extensive experiments on six public benchmarks show that TV-Rec outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines by an average of 7.49%.

Abstract: In recommendation systems, how to effectively scale up recommendation models
has been an essential research topic. While significant progress has been made
in developing advanced and scalable architectures for sequential
recommendation(SR) models, there are still challenges due to items'
multi-faceted characteristics and dynamic item relevance in the user context.
To address these issues, we propose Fuxi-MME, a framework that integrates a
multi-embedding strategy with a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture.
Specifically, to efficiently capture diverse item characteristics in a
decoupled manner, we decompose the conventional single embedding matrix into
several lower-dimensional embedding matrices. Additionally, by substituting
relevant parameters in the Fuxi Block with an MoE layer, our model achieves
adaptive and specialized transformation of the enriched representations.
Empirical results on public datasets show that our proposed framework
outperforms several competitive baselines.

Abstract: Despite the surge in patent applications and emergence of AI drafting tools,
systematic evaluation of patent content quality has received limited research
attention. To address this gap, We propose to evaluate patents using regulatory
compliance, technical coherence, and figure-reference consistency detection
modules, and then generate improvement suggestions via an integration module.
The framework is validated on a comprehensive dataset comprising 80
human-authored and 80 AI-generated patents from two patent drafting tools.
Experimental results show balanced accuracies of 99.74\%, 82.12\%, and 91.2\%
respectively across the three detection modules when validated against expert
annotations. Additional analysis was conducted to examine defect distributions
across patent sections, technical domains, and authoring sources. Section-based
analysis indicates that figure-text consistency and technical detail precision
require particular attention. Mechanical Engineering and Construction show more
claim-specification inconsistencies due to complex technical documentation
requirements. AI-generated patents show a significant gap compared to
human-authored ones. While human-authored patents primarily contain
surface-level errors like typos, AI-generated patents exhibit more structural
defects in figure-text alignment and cross-references.

### [82] [Generalized Pseudo-Relevance Feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25488)
*Yiteng Tu,Weihang Su,Yujia Zhou,Yiqun Liu,Fen Lin,Qin Liu,Qingyao Ai*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 本文提出了广义伪相关反馈(GPRF)框架，通过模型无关的自然语言重写来克服传统PRF方法对相关性和模型架构假设的依赖，并使用强化学习训练确保对噪声反馈的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统伪相关反馈方法依赖两个主要假设：相关性假设（顶部文档相关）和模型假设（重写方法需针对特定模型架构设计）。LLM生成的相关反馈虽然实现模型无关查询重构，但存在严重幻觉或仍依赖相关性假设。

Method: 提出广义伪相关反馈(GPRF)框架，执行模型无关的自然语言重写，基于检索文档但不依赖相关性假设。设计了基于强化学习的效用导向训练流程，确保对噪声反馈的鲁棒性。

Result: 在多个基准测试和检索器上的广泛实验表明，GPRF始终优于强基线方法，证明了其作为查询重写框架的有效性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: GPRF是一个假设放宽的框架，不仅消除了模型假设，还减少了对相关性假设的依赖，为查询重写提供了有效且可推广的解决方案。

Abstract: Query rewriting is a fundamental technique in information retrieval (IR). It
typically employs the retrieval result as relevance feedback to refine the
query and thereby addresses the vocabulary mismatch between user queries and
relevant documents. Traditional pseudo-relevance feedback (PRF) and its
vector-based extension (VPRF) improve retrieval performance by leveraging
top-retrieved documents as relevance feedback. However, they are constructed
based on two major hypotheses: the relevance assumption (top documents are
relevant) and the model assumption (rewriting methods need to be designed
specifically for particular model architectures). While recent large language
models (LLMs)-based generative relevance feedback (GRF) enables model-free
query reformulation, it either suffers from severe LLM hallucination or, again,
relies on the relevance assumption to guarantee the effectiveness of rewriting
quality. To overcome these limitations, we introduce an assumption-relaxed
framework: \textit{Generalized Pseudo Relevance Feedback} (GPRF), which
performs model-free, natural language rewriting based on retrieved documents,
not only eliminating the model assumption but also reducing dependence on the
relevance assumption. Specifically, we design a utility-oriented training
pipeline with reinforcement learning to ensure robustness against noisy
feedback. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks and retrievers
demonstrate that GPRF consistently outperforms strong baselines, establishing
it as an effective and generalizable framework for query rewriting.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 提出了ADA-SID框架，通过自适应行为-内容对齐和动态行为路由器解决语义ID学习中的噪声污染和信号模糊问题，显著提升了推荐系统的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于ItemID的方法在大规模动态数据集中扩展性和泛化能力不足，而纯内容语义ID忽略了行为特征。现有方法未能处理用户-物品交互的高度偏斜和多样性，导致噪声污染和信号模糊问题。

Method: 提出MMQ-v2混合量化框架，包含自适应行为-内容对齐（基于信息丰富度保护表示免受噪声污染）和动态行为路由器（为不同SID应用不同权重以放大关键信号）。

Result: 在公开和大规模工业数据集上的广泛实验表明，ADA-SID在生成式和判别式推荐任务中都表现出显著优势。

Conclusion: ADA-SID通过自适应对齐、去噪和放大机制，有效解决了语义ID学习中的关键挑战，为推荐系统提供了更强大的表示学习能力。

Abstract: Industrial recommender systems rely on unique Item Identifiers (ItemIDs).
However, this method struggles with scalability and generalization in large,
dynamic datasets that have sparse long-tail data.Content-based Semantic IDs
(SIDs) address this by sharing knowledge through content quantization. However,
by ignoring dynamic behavioral properties, purely content-based SIDs have
limited expressive power. Existing methods attempt to incorporate behavioral
information but overlook a critical distinction: unlike relatively uniform
content features, user-item interactions are highly skewed and diverse,
creating a vast information gap in quality and quantity between popular and
long-tail items. This oversight leads to two critical limitations: (1) Noise
Corruption: Indiscriminate behavior-content alignment allows collaborative
noise from long-tail items to corrupt their content representations, leading to
the loss of critical multimodal information. (2)Signal Obscurity: The
equal-weighting scheme for SIDs fails to reflect the varying importance of
different behavioral signals, making it difficult for downstream tasks to
distinguish important SIDs from uninformative ones. To tackle these issues, we
propose a mixture-of-quantization framework, MMQ-v2, to adaptively Align,
Denoise, and Amplify multimodal information from content and behavior
modalities for semantic IDs learning. The semantic IDs generated by this
framework named ADA-SID. It introduces two innovations: an adaptive
behavior-content alignment that is aware of information richness to shield
representations from noise, and a dynamic behavioral router to amplify critical
signals by applying different weights to SIDs. Extensive experiments on public
and large-scale industrial datasets demonstrate ADA-SID's significant
superiority in both generative and discriminative recommendation tasks.

*Zesheng Liu,YoungHyun Koo,Maryam Rahnemoonfar*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: KAN-GCN是一种用于冰盖建模的快速准确模拟器，将Kolmogorov-Arnold网络作为图卷积网络的特征校准器，通过可学习的一维扭曲和线性混合步骤改善特征条件化，在不增加消息传递深度的情况下提高非线性编码能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提高冰盖数值模型模拟器的性能，通过改进特征条件化和非线性编码来获得更好的精度与效率权衡。

Method: 在GCN前放置KAN作为特征校准器，应用可学习的一维扭曲和线性混合步骤，训练和测试使用36个融化率模拟数据，包含3种网格大小设置。

Result: 在2到5层架构中，KAN-GCN匹配或超越了纯GCN和MLP-GCN基线的精度；在较粗网格上通过用节点级变换替换边级消息传递层提高了推理吞吐量。

Conclusion: KAN优先设计为大型瞬态场景扫描提供了有利的精度与效率权衡。

Abstract: We introduce KAN-GCN, a fast and accurate emulator for ice sheet modeling
that places a Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) as a feature-wise calibrator
before graph convolution networks (GCNs). The KAN front end applies learnable
one-dimensional warps and a linear mixing step, improving feature conditioning
and nonlinear encoding without increasing message-passing depth. We employ this
architecture to improve the performance of emulators for numerical ice sheet
models. Our emulator is trained and tested using 36 melting-rate simulations
with 3 mesh-size settings for Pine Island Glacier, Antarctica. Across 2- to
5-layer architectures, KAN-GCN matches or exceeds the accuracy of pure GCN and
MLP-GCN baselines. Despite a small parameter overhead, KAN-GCN improves
inference throughput on coarser meshes by replacing one edge-wise
message-passing layer with a node-wise transform; only the finest mesh shows a
modest cost. Overall, KAN-first designs offer a favorable accuracy vs.
efficiency trade-off for large transient scenario sweeps.

*Vladyslav Larin,Ihor Naumenko,Aleksei Ivashov,Ivan Nikitin,Alexander Firsov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Fortytwo是一个利用群体智能和分布式成对排名共识的新型AI推理协议，通过声誉加权的异构模型协作显著提升推理性能，在多个基准测试中表现优于多数投票方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着集中式AI面临计算瓶颈和大型训练收益递减，需要能够横向扩展容量和能力的推理层来满足需求。

Method: 采用群体推理方法：基于成对排名的Bradley-Terry风格聚合模型，结合链上声誉系统，通过能力证明和声誉质押来抵抗Sybil攻击。

Result: 在GPQA Diamond上达到85.90%准确率，比相同模型集的多数投票方法(68.69%)提升17.21个百分点(+25.1%相对提升)，在对抗性提示下性能下降仅0.12%。

Conclusion: 为去中心化AI系统奠定了基础，通过集体智能实现高质量推理的民主化访问，同时保持可靠性和安全性。

Abstract: As centralized AI hits compute ceilings and diminishing returns from
ever-larger training runs, meeting demand requires an inference layer that
scales horizontally in both capacity and capability. We present Fortytwo, a
novel protocol that leverages swarm intelligence principles and distributed
pairwise ranking consensus to achieve superior performance in AI inference. Our
approach reimagines collaboration among AI nodes using swarm inference: a
peer-ranked, reputation-weighted consensus across heterogeneous models that
surfaces the highest-quality responses. Using pairwise ranking with a custom
Bradley-Terry-style aggregation model, we demonstrate that swarm inference
substantially outperforms majority voting, achieving 85.90% on GPQA Diamond
versus 68.69% for majority voting with the same model set - an improvement of
+17.21 percentage points (approximately +25.1% relative). The protocol
incorporates on-chain reputation so node influence adapts to demonstrated
accuracy over time, yielding a meritocratic consensus that filters low-quality
or malicious participants. To resist Sybil attacks, Fortytwo employs
proof-of-capability in its consensus: nodes must successfully complete
calibration/test requests and stake reputation to enter ranking rounds, making
multi-identity attacks economically unattractive while preserving openness.
Across six challenging benchmarks, including GPQA Diamond, LiveCodeBench, and
AIME, our evaluation indicates higher accuracy and strong resilience to
adversarial and noisy free-form prompting (e.g., prompt-injection degradation
of only 0.12% versus 6.20% for a monolithic single-model baseline), while
retaining practical deployability. Together, these results establish a
foundation for decentralized AI systems - democratizing access to high-quality
inference through collective intelligence without sacrificing reliability or
security.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于数据驱动的降维方法，专门用于处理双曲波传播的物理数据，采用低秩神经表示（LRNR）架构和超网络框架，能够从数据中学习高效的波传播低维表示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对双曲波传播物理数据的高效表示问题，基于理论证明这类波存在高效表示的可能性，开发专门的数据驱动降维方法。

Method: 使用低秩神经表示（LRNR）架构结合超网络框架，通过深度学习技术直接从数据中学习波传播的低维表示，发现自然产生的低秩张量分解。

Result: LRNR能够学习到波传播的高效低维表示，揭示出可解释物理特征的分解模式，并通过压缩方案实现高效推理。

Conclusion: LRNR架构为波传播数据提供了高效且可解释的表示方法，在性能要求高的场景中具有重要应用价值。

Abstract: We present a data-driven dimensionality reduction method that is well-suited
for physics-based data representing hyperbolic wave propagation. The method
utilizes a specialized neural network architecture called low rank neural
representation (LRNR) inside a hypernetwork framework. The architecture is
motivated by theoretical results that rigorously prove the existence of
efficient representations for this wave class. We illustrate through archetypal
examples that such an efficient low-dimensional representation of propagating
waves can be learned directly from data through a combination of deep learning
techniques. We observe that a low rank tensor representation arises naturally
in the trained LRNRs, and that this reveals a new decomposition of wave
propagation where each decomposed mode corresponds to interpretable physical
features. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the LRNR architecture enables
efficient inference via a compression scheme, which is a potentially important
feature when deploying LRNRs in demanding performance regimes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 先前关于弱到强泛化的理论研究大多局限于抽象框架或线性/随机特征模型，本文旨在在更具体的CNN架构中提供形式化分析。

Method: 使用结构化数据（包含不同难度的标签相关信号和标签无关噪声），分析强模型在预训练弱模型标注数据上使用梯度下降训练时的动态过程。

Result: 识别了两种机制：数据稀缺机制下泛化通过良性过拟合或有害过拟合发生；数据丰富机制下泛化通过早期标签校正实现，但过度训练会降低性能。

Conclusion: 弱到强泛化在不同数据机制下表现出不同的动态特性，为理解这一现象提供了更深入的理论洞察。

Abstract: Weak-to-strong generalization refers to the phenomenon where a stronger model
trained under supervision from a weaker one can outperform its teacher. While
prior studies aim to explain this effect, most theoretical insights are limited
to abstract frameworks or linear/random feature models. In this paper, we
provide a formal analysis of weak-to-strong generalization from a linear CNN
(weak) to a two-layer ReLU CNN (strong). We consider structured data composed
of label-dependent signals of varying difficulty and label-independent noise,
and analyze gradient descent dynamics when the strong model is trained on data
labeled by the pretrained weak model. Our analysis identifies two regimes --
data-scarce and data-abundant -- based on the signal-to-noise characteristics
of the dataset, and reveals distinct mechanisms of weak-to-strong
generalization. In the data-scarce regime, generalization occurs via benign
overfitting or fails via harmful overfitting, depending on the amount of data,
and we characterize the transition boundary. In the data-abundant regime,
generalization emerges in the early phase through label correction, but we
observe that overtraining can subsequently degrade performance.

Abstract: While many problems in machine learning focus on learning mappings between
finite-dimensional spaces, scientific applications require approximating
mappings between function spaces, i.e., operators. We study the problem of
learning collections of operators and provide both theoretical and empirical
advances. We distinguish between two regimes: (i) multiple operator learning,
where a single network represents a continuum of operators parameterized by a
parametric function, and (ii) learning several distinct single operators, where
each operator is learned independently. For the multiple operator case, we
introduce two new architectures, $\mathrm{MNO}$ and $\mathrm{MONet}$, and
establish universal approximation results in three settings: continuous,
integrable, or Lipschitz operators. For the latter, we further derive explicit
scaling laws that quantify how the network size must grow to achieve a target
approximation accuracy. For learning several single operators, we develop a
framework for balancing architectural complexity across subnetworks and show
how approximation order determines computational efficiency. Empirical
experiments on parametric PDE benchmarks confirm the strong expressive power
and efficiency of the proposed architectures. Overall, this work establishes a
unified theoretical and practical foundation for scalable neural operator
learning across multiple operators.

Abstract: Machine learning models increasingly map biological sequence-fitness
landscapes to predict mutational effects. Effective evaluation of these models
requires benchmarks curated from empirical data. Despite their impressive
scales, existing benchmarks lack topographical information regarding the
underlying fitness landscapes, which hampers interpretation and comparison of
model performance beyond averaged scores. Here, we introduce GraphFLA, a Python
framework that constructs and analyzes fitness landscapes from mutagensis data
in diverse modalities (e.g., DNA, RNA, protein, and beyond) with up to millions
of mutants. GraphFLA calculates 20 biologically relevant features that
characterize 4 fundamental aspects of landscape topography. By applying
GraphFLA to over 5,300 landscapes from ProteinGym, RNAGym, and CIS-BP, we
demonstrate its utility in interpreting and comparing the performance of dozens
of fitness prediction models, highlighting factors influencing model accuracy
and respective advantages of different models. In addition, we release 155
combinatorially complete empirical fitness landscapes, encompassing over 2.2
million sequences across various modalities. All the codes and datasets are

Abstract: Low-rank pseudoinverses are widely used to approximate matrix inverses in
scalable machine learning, optimization, and scientific computing. However,
real-world matrices are often observed with noise, arising from sampling,
sketching, and quantization. The spectral-norm robustness of low-rank inverse
approximations remains poorly understood. We systematically study the
spectral-norm error $\| (\tilde{A}^{-1})_p - A_p^{-1} \|$ for an $n\times n$
symmetric matrix $A$, where $A_p^{-1}$ denotes the best rank-\(p\)
approximation of $A^{-1}$, and $\tilde{A} = A + E$ is a noisy observation.
Under mild assumptions on the noise, we derive sharp non-asymptotic
perturbation bounds that reveal how the error scales with the eigengap,
spectral decay, and noise alignment with low-curvature directions of $A$. Our
analysis introduces a novel application of contour integral techniques to the
\emph{non-entire} function $f(z) = 1/z$, yielding bounds that improve over
naive adaptations of classical full-inverse bounds by up to a factor of
$\sqrt{n}$. Empirically, our bounds closely track the true perturbation error
across a variety of real-world and synthetic matrices, while estimates based on
classical results tend to significantly overpredict. These findings offer
practical, spectrum-aware guarantees for low-rank inverse approximations in
noisy computational environments.

Abstract: The integration of the Internet of Things (IoT) and Artificial Intelligence
offers significant opportunities to enhance our ability to monitor and address
ecological changes. As environmental challenges become increasingly pressing,
the need for effective remote monitoring solutions is more critical than ever.
A major challenge in designing IoT applications for environmental monitoring -
particularly those involving image data - is to create energy-efficient IoT
devices capable of long-term operation in remote areas with limited power
availability. Advancements in the field of Tiny Machine Learning allow the use
of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) on resource-constrained,
battery-operated microcontrollers. Since data transfer is energy-intensive,
performing inference directly on microcontrollers to reduce the message size
can extend the operational lifespan of IoT nodes. This work evaluates the use
of common Low Power Wide Area Networks and compressed CNNs trained on domain
specific datasets on an ESP32-S3. Our experiments demonstrate, among other
things, that executing CNN inference on-device and transmitting only the
results reduces the overall energy consumption by a factor of up to five
compared to sending raw image data. %The compression of the model using Post
Training Quantization is accompanied by an acceptable reduction in accuracy of
only a few percentage points compared to a non-quantized model. These findings
advocate the development of IoT applications with reduced carbon footprint and
capable of operating autonomously in environmental monitoring scenarios by
incorporating Embedded Machine Learning.

Motivation: 机器学习中需要理解噪声或测量误差如何影响低秩近似，特别是在谱范数下。现有工作通常分析Frobenius范数误差，但该指标可能高估或低估真实的子空间失真，而谱范数能捕获最坏情况的方向误差并提供最强的效用保证。

Abstract: A central challenge in machine learning is to understand how noise or
measurement errors affect low-rank approximations, particularly in the spectral
norm. This question is especially important in differentially private low-rank
approximation, where one aims to preserve the top-$p$ structure of a
data-derived matrix while ensuring privacy. Prior work often analyzes Frobenius
norm error or changes in reconstruction quality, but these metrics can over- or
under-estimate true subspace distortion. The spectral norm, by contrast,
captures worst-case directional error and provides the strongest utility
guarantees. We establish new high-probability spectral-norm perturbation bounds
for symmetric matrices that refine the classical Eckart--Young--Mirsky theorem
and explicitly capture interactions between a matrix $A \in \mathbb{R}^{n
\times n}$ and an arbitrary symmetric perturbation $E$. Under mild eigengap and
norm conditions, our bounds yield sharp estimates for $\|(A + E)_p - A_p\|$,
where $A_p$ is the best rank-$p$ approximation of $A$, with improvements of up
to a factor of $\sqrt{n}$. As an application, we derive improved utility
guarantees for differentially private PCA, resolving an open problem in the
literature. Our analysis relies on a novel contour bootstrapping method from
complex analysis and extends it to a broad class of spectral functionals,
including polynomials and matrix exponentials. Empirical results on real-world
datasets confirm that our bounds closely track the actual spectral error under
diverse perturbation regimes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 挑战现有OOD泛化基准中ID与OOD准确率正相关性的普遍观点，认为这种相关性可能掩盖了模型在OOD鲁棒性方面的重要失效模式。

Method: 提出基于梯度的OODSelect方法，识别语义一致的OOD子集，在这些子集中检验ID与OOD准确率的关系。

Result: 在广泛使用的分布偏移基准中，OODSelect发现了占标准OOD集一半以上的子集，其中更高ID准确率预测更低OOD准确率，与聚合指标显示的相反。

Conclusion: 聚合指标可能掩盖OOD鲁棒性的重要失效模式，需要更细粒度的分析来理解模型在OOD泛化中的真实表现。

Abstract: Benchmarks for out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization frequently show a
strong positive correlation between in-distribution (ID) and OOD accuracy
across models, termed "accuracy-on-the-line." This pattern is often taken to
imply that spurious correlations - correlations that improve ID but reduce OOD
performance - are rare in practice. We find that this positive correlation is
often an artifact of aggregating heterogeneous OOD examples. Using a simple
gradient-based method, OODSelect, we identify semantically coherent OOD subsets
where accuracy on the line does not hold. Across widely used distribution shift
benchmarks, the OODSelect uncovers subsets, sometimes over half of the standard
OOD set, where higher ID accuracy predicts lower OOD accuracy. Our findings
indicate that aggregate metrics can obscure important failure modes of OOD
robustness. We release code and the identified subsets to facilitate further
research.

Motivation: 现有基于LoRA的持续学习方法主要关注保持先前任务的性能，但这忽视了推荐系统的特殊性：目标不是预测过去偏好，过时的偏好甚至会在当前兴趣显著变化时损害性能。

Method: 提出PESO方法，引入近端正则化器，将当前适配器锚定到其最近的冻结状态，使模型能够灵活平衡适应性和保留性，更好地捕捉近期用户行为。

Result: 理论上证明这种近端设计在LoRA子空间中提供数据感知、方向性指导。实证上，PESO持续优于现有的基于LoRA的持续学习方法。

Conclusion: PESO通过近端正则化有效解决了推荐系统中持续学习的独特挑战，在适应性和保留性之间实现了更好的平衡。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) achieve strong performance in
recommendation, they face challenges in continual learning as users, items, and
user preferences evolve over time. Existing LoRA-based continual methods
primarily focus on preserving performance on previous tasks, but this overlooks
the unique nature of recommendation: the goal is not to predict past
preferences, and outdated preferences can even harm performance when current
interests shift significantly. To address this, we propose PESO (Proximally
rEgularized Single evolving lOra, a continual adaptation method for LoRA in
recommendation. PESO introduces a proximal regularizer that anchors the current
adapter to its most recent frozen state, enabling the model to flexibly balance
adaptation and preservation, and to better capture recent user behaviors.
Theoretically, we show that this proximal design provides data-aware,
direction-wise guidance in the LoRA subspace. Empirically, PESO consistently
outperforms existing LoRA-based continual learning methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一种利用李群对称性精确求解初边值问题的方法，通过对称变换将物理定律内嵌于模型中，从初始和边界数据学习解，比PINNs更快更准确。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法如PINNs在求解偏微分方程时存在收敛慢、精度不足的问题，需要一种能精确满足PDE约束且计算高效的方法。

Method: 利用李群对称性构造模型，通过对称变换将PDE约束精确内嵌，直接从初始和边界条件学习解，损失函数直接反映模型精度。

Result: LieSolver在线性齐次PDE上表现优于PINNs，计算速度更快、精度更高，并能提供严格的误差估计。

Conclusion: 该方法提高了PDE约束问题的计算效率和预测可靠性，为IBVP求解提供了更有效的工具。

Abstract: We introduce a method for efficiently solving initial-boundary value problems
(IBVPs) that uses Lie symmetries to enforce the associated partial differential
equation (PDE) exactly by construction. By leveraging symmetry transformations,
the model inherently incorporates the physical laws and learns solutions from
initial and boundary data. As a result, the loss directly measures the model's
accuracy, leading to improved convergence. Moreover, for well-posed IBVPs, our
method enables rigorous error estimation. The approach yields compact models,
facilitating an efficient optimization. We implement LieSolver and demonstrate
its application to linear homogeneous PDEs with a range of initial conditions,
showing that it is faster and more accurate than physics-informed neural
networks (PINNs). Overall, our method improves both computational efficiency
and the reliability of predictions for PDE-constrained problems.

TL;DR: 开发了一种自适应多任务EEG分类器，使用GRU-TCN网络结合DQN阈值调整，用于床边快速卒中分诊，在卒中类型分类上达到98%准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 快速卒中分诊需要准确、床边可部署的工具，EEG有潜力但在初次接触时使用不足。

Method: 将32通道EEG信号转换为功率谱密度特征，使用GRU-TCN网络预测卒中类型、半球偏侧化和严重程度，并应用DQN实时调整决策阈值。

Result: 基线GRU-TCN在卒中类型分类上达到89.3%准确率，使用DQN阈值适应后提升至98.0%。严重程度和偏侧化分类分别达到96.9%和96.7%准确率。

Conclusion: 自适应阈值调整可将操作点转移到临床偏好的敏感度-特异度权衡，同时集成的头皮图和频谱可视化支持可解释性。

Abstract: Rapid triage of suspected stroke needs accurate, bedside-deployable tools;
EEG is promising but underused at first contact. We present an adaptive
multitask EEG classifier that converts 32-channel signals to power spectral
density features (Welch), uses a recurrent-convolutional network (GRU-TCN) to
predict stroke type (healthy, ischemic, hemorrhagic), hemispheric
lateralization, and severity, and applies a deep Q-network (DQN) to tune
decision thresholds in real time. Using a patient-wise split of the UCLH Stroke
EIT/EEG data set (44 recordings; about 26 acute stroke, 10 controls), the
primary outcome was stroke-type performance; secondary outcomes were severity
and lateralization. The baseline GRU-TCN reached 89.3% accuracy (F1 92.8%) for
stroke type, about 96.9% (F1 95.9%) for severity, and about 96.7% (F1 97.4%)
for lateralization. With DQN threshold adaptation, stroke-type accuracy
increased to about 98.0% (F1 97.7%). We also tested robustness on an
independent, low-density EEG cohort (ZJU4H) and report paired patient-level
statistics. Analyses follow STARD 2015 guidance for diagnostic accuracy studies
(index test: GRU-TCN+DQN; reference standard: radiology/clinical diagnosis;
patient-wise evaluation). Adaptive thresholding shifts the operating point to
clinically preferred sensitivity-specificity trade-offs, while integrated
scalp-map and spectral visualizations support interpretability.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了nnLDA，一种神经增强的概率主题模型，通过神经先验机制动态整合辅助信息，在主题一致性、困惑度和下游分类任务上优于传统LDA和Dirichlet-Multinomial回归。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统主题模型如LDA难以整合元数据、用户属性或文档标签等辅助信息，这限制了其表达能力、个性化程度和可解释性。

Method: nnLDA将每个文档建模为潜在主题的混合，其中主题比例的先验由基于辅助特征的神经网络生成，并开发了随机变分期望最大化算法来联合优化神经和概率组件。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上，nnLDA在主题一致性、困惑度和下游分类任务上持续优于LDA和Dirichlet-Multinomial回归。

Conclusion: 结果表明，在存在辅助信息的情况下，将神经网络表示学习与概率主题建模相结合具有显著优势。

Abstract: Traditional topic models such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) have been
widely used to uncover latent structures in text corpora, but they often
struggle to integrate auxiliary information such as metadata, user attributes,
or document labels. These limitations restrict their expressiveness,
personalization, and interpretability. To address this, we propose nnLDA, a
neural-augmented probabilistic topic model that dynamically incorporates side
information through a neural prior mechanism. nnLDA models each document as a
mixture of latent topics, where the prior over topic proportions is generated
by a neural network conditioned on auxiliary features. This design allows the
model to capture complex nonlinear interactions between side information and
topic distributions that static Dirichlet priors cannot represent. We develop a
stochastic variational Expectation-Maximization algorithm to jointly optimize
the neural and probabilistic components. Across multiple benchmark datasets,
nnLDA consistently outperforms LDA and Dirichlet-Multinomial Regression in
topic coherence, perplexity, and downstream classification. These results
highlight the benefits of combining neural representation learning with
probabilistic topic modeling in settings where side information is available.

TL;DR: 提出了WBT-BGRL框架，通过加权三元组损失增强自举学习，用于二分图的归纳式链接预测


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 二分图链接预测在推荐系统和故障检测中很重要，但现有方法在归纳、加权和二分图场景中的有效性未经测试，对比方法存在负采样效率低和偏差问题

Method: 使用双GCN编码器的二分图架构，在自举学习中引入加权机制的三元组损失，是非对比学习方法

Result: 在真实世界数据集（工业和电商）上表现出竞争力，特别是在预训练阶段应用加权时效果更好

Conclusion: 加权非对比学习对二分图的归纳式链接预测具有重要价值

Abstract: Link prediction in bipartite graphs is crucial for applications like
recommendation systems and failure detection, yet it is less studied than in
monopartite graphs. Contrastive methods struggle with inefficient and biased
negative sampling, while non-contrastive approaches rely solely on positive
samples. Existing models perform well in transductive settings, but their
effectiveness in inductive, weighted, and bipartite scenarios remains untested.
To address this, we propose Weighted Bipartite Triplet-Bootstrapped Graph
Latents (WBT-BGRL), a non-contrastive framework that enhances bootstrapped
learning with a novel weighting mechanism in the triplet loss. Using a
bipartite architecture with dual GCN encoders, WBT-BGRL is evaluated against
adapted state-of-the-art models (T-BGRL, BGRL, GBT, CCA-SSG). Results on
real-world datasets (Industry and E-commerce) show competitive performance,
especially when weighting is applied during pretraining-highlighting the value
of weighted, non-contrastive learning for inductive link prediction in
bipartite graphs.

### [100] [Can Aha Moments Be Fake? Identifying True and Decorative Thinking Steps in Chain-of-Thought](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24941)
*Jiachen Zhao,Yiyou Sun,Weiyan Shi,Dawn Song*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 研究发现LLMs生成的思维链中许多推理步骤实际上对最终预测没有因果影响，这些装饰性思考步骤只是表面推理，揭示了CoT的可信度问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前假设思维链忠实反映模型内部思考过程，但研究发现许多推理步骤实际上并不真正影响模型预测，这质疑了CoT作为监控不安全意图工具的有效性。

Method: 提出真实思考分数(TTS)来测量每个推理步骤对最终预测的因果影响，并识别了LLMs潜在空间中的真实思考方向，通过沿该方向操控可以强制模型执行或忽略特定CoT步骤。

Result: 在AIME数据集中，只有平均2.3%的推理步骤TTS≥0.7，表明大部分步骤是装饰性的。通过操控真实思考方向可以改变模型对自我验证步骤的内部推理，从而影响最终结果。

Conclusion: LLMs经常口头表达推理步骤而不真正在内部执行，这既损害了LLM推理的效率，也削弱了CoT的可信度。

Abstract: Recent large language models (LLMs) can generate long Chain-of-Thought (CoT)
at test time, enabling them to solve complex tasks. These reasoning steps in
CoT are often assumed as a faithful reflection of the model's internal thinking
process, and used to monitor unsafe intentions. However, we find many reasoning
steps don't truly contribute to LLMs' prediction. We measure the step-wise
causal influence of each reasoning step on the model's final prediction with a
proposed True Thinking Score (TTS). We reveal that LLMs often interleave
between true-thinking steps (which are genuinely used to produce the final
output) and decorative-thinking steps (which only give the appearance of
reasoning but have minimal causal impact). Notably, only a small subset of the
total reasoning steps have a high TTS that causally drive the model's
prediction: e.g., for the AIME dataset, only an average of 2.3% of reasoning
steps in CoT have a TTS >= 0.7 (range: 0-1) under the Qwen-2.5 model.
Furthermore, we identify a TrueThinking direction in the latent space of LLMs.
By steering along or against this direction, we can force the model to perform
or disregard certain CoT steps when computing the final result. Finally, we
highlight that self-verification steps in CoT (i.e., aha moments) can also be
decorative, where LLMs do not truly verify their solution. Steering along the
TrueThinking direction can force internal reasoning over these steps, resulting
in a change in the final results. Overall, our work reveals that LLMs often
verbalize reasoning steps without actually performing them internally, which
undermines both the efficiency of LLM reasoning and the trustworthiness of CoT.

TL;DR: 该研究发现视觉语言模型存在文化敏感神经元，这些神经元对特定文化背景的输入表现出选择性敏感，并在文化多样性视觉问答中发挥重要作用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管视觉语言模型性能出色，但在处理文化相关输入时仍存在困难，需要理解模型如何处理文化基础信息。

Method: 使用CVQA基准识别文化选择性神经元，通过消融实验测试不同识别方法标记的神经元，并提出新的基于边际的选择器CAS。

Result: 在三个VLMs和25个文化群体的实验中，发现存在特定神经元，其消融会显著损害对应文化问题的性能，而对其他文化影响很小。CAS方法在识别文化敏感神经元方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 文化敏感神经元倾向于聚集在某些解码器层中，这为多模态表征的内部组织提供了新的见解。

Abstract: Despite their impressive performance, vision-language models (VLMs) still
struggle on culturally situated inputs. To understand how VLMs process
culturally grounded information, we study the presence of culture-sensitive
neurons, i.e. neurons whose activations show preferential sensitivity to inputs
associated with particular cultural contexts. We examine whether such neurons
are important for culturally diverse visual question answering and where they
are located. Using the CVQA benchmark, we identify neurons of culture
selectivity and perform causal tests by deactivating the neurons flagged by
different identification methods. Experiments on three VLMs across 25 cultural
groups demonstrate the existence of neurons whose ablation disproportionately
harms performance on questions about the corresponding cultures, while having
minimal effects on others. Moreover, we propose a new margin-based selector -
Contrastive Activation Selection (CAS), and show that it outperforms existing
probability- and entropy-based methods in identifying culture-sensitive
neurons. Finally, our layer-wise analyses reveals that such neurons tend to
cluster in certain decoder layers. Overall, our findings shed new light on the
internal organization of multimodal representations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代机器学习计算需求不断增长，在嵌入式等资源受限平台上受到限制，同时需要神经网络在分布偏移或未见数据下提供可靠预测。贝叶斯神经网络能量化不确定性但计算开销更大，因此需要同时提升算法和硬件效率。

Conclusion: 效率和可靠性可以通过算法-硬件协同设计共同推进，该方法为资源受限平台上的机器学习部署提供了可行的解决方案，实现了高效且鲁棒的推理。

Abstract: While modern machine learning has transformed numerous application domains,
its growing computational demands increasingly constrain scalability and
efficiency, particularly on embedded and resource-limited platforms. In
practice, neural networks must not only operate efficiently but also provide
reliable predictions under distributional shifts or unseen data. Bayesian
neural networks offer a principled framework for quantifying uncertainty, yet
their computational overhead further compounds these challenges.
  This work advances resource-efficient and robust inference for both
conventional and Bayesian neural networks through the joint pursuit of
algorithmic and hardware efficiency. The former reduces computation through
model compression and approximate Bayesian inference, while the latter
optimizes deployment on digital accelerators and explores analog hardware,
bridging algorithmic design and physical realization. The first contribution,
Galen, performs automatic layer-specific compression guided by sensitivity
analysis and hardware-in-the-loop feedback. Analog accelerators offer
efficiency gains at the cost of noise; this work models device imperfections
and extends noisy training to nonstationary conditions, improving robustness
and stability. A second line of work advances probabilistic inference,
developing analytic and ensemble approximations that replace costly sampling,
integrate into a compiler stack, and optimize embedded inference. Finally,
probabilistic photonic computing introduces a paradigm where controlled analog
noise acts as an intrinsic entropy source, enabling fast, energy-efficient
probabilistic inference directly in hardware.
  Together, these studies demonstrate how efficiency and reliability can be
advanced jointly through algorithm-hardware co-design, laying the foundation
for the next generation of trustworthy, energy-efficient machine-learning
systems.

Motivation: 理解大型语言模型固有的低维结构是一个重要问题，需要从模型无关的角度研究其作为序列概率模型的低维特性。

Method: 通过实证研究展示多种现代语言模型具有低秩结构，并利用这种结构通过线性组合不相关提示的输出来生成目标提示的响应。

Result: 实验证明语言模型的logits矩阵具有低近似秩，这种低秩结构可以成功用于生成任务。

Conclusion: 语言模型的低秩结构提供了一个简单的通用抽象，其理论预测与实验结果一致，并给出了可证明的学习保证。

Abstract: A major problem in the study of large language models is to understand their
inherent low-dimensional structure. We introduce an approach to study the
low-dimensional structure of language models at a model-agnostic level: as
sequential probabilistic models. We first empirically demonstrate that a wide
range of modern language models exhibit low-rank structure: in particular,
matrices built from the model's logits for varying sets of prompts and
responses have low approximate rank. We then show that this low-rank structure
can be leveraged for generation -- in particular, we can generate a response to
a target prompt using a linear combination of the model's outputs on unrelated,
or even nonsensical prompts.
  On the theoretical front, we observe that studying the approximate rank of
language models in the sense discussed above yields a simple universal
abstraction whose theoretical predictions parallel our experiments. We then
analyze the representation power of the abstraction and give provable learning
guarantees.

Motivation: 现有的机器学习辅助定向进化方法通常依赖单一构象或单一委员会，无法有效区分构象不确定性和认知不确定性，限制了在抗体适应性景观导航中的效果。

Result: 在SARS-CoV-2抗体对接任务中验证了该方法，相比基线策略取得了显著改进。

Conclusion: 该方法为治疗性抗体发现提供了可扩展的途径，同时直接解决了建模构象不确定性的挑战。

Abstract: Machine Learning-assisted directed evolution (MLDE) is a powerful tool for
efficiently navigating antibody fitness landscapes. Many structure-aware MLDE
pipelines rely on a single conformation or a single committee across all
conformations, limiting their ability to separate conformational uncertainty
from epistemic uncertainty. Here, we introduce a rank -conditioned committee
(RCC) framework that leverages ranked conformations to assign a deep neural
network committee per rank. This design enables a principled separation between
epistemic uncertainty and conformational uncertainty. We validate our approach
on SARS-CoV-2 antibody docking, demonstrating significant improvements over
baseline strategies. Our results offer a scalable route for therapeutic
antibody discovery while directly addressing the challenge of modeling
conformational uncertainty.

Abstract: The exponential growth of data volumes has led to escalating computational
costs in machine learning model training. However, many features fail to
contribute positively to model performance while consuming substantial
computational resources. This paper presents an end-to-end feature selection
framework for tabular data based on game theory. We formulate feature selection
procedure based on a cooperative game where features are modeled as players,
and their importance is determined through the evaluation of synergistic
interactions and marginal contributions. The proposed framework comprises four
core components: sample selection, game-theoretic feature importance
evaluation, redundant feature elimination, and optimized model training.
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves substantial
computation reduction while preserving predictive performance, thereby offering
an efficient solution of the computational challenges of large-scale machine
learning. The source code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的扩散策略在离线强化学习中具有竞争力，但在采样时通常使用缺乏统计风险概念的启发式方法进行引导。

Method: 累积对数似然比，并使用逻辑控制器对条件均值进行门控，阈值τ在H0下校准一次以满足用户指定的Type-I水平α。训练保持标准DDPM结构，LRT引导自然与Q梯度组合。

Result: 在D4RL MuJoCo任务上，LRT-Diffusion在实现中改善了回报-OOD权衡，优于强Q引导基线，同时满足期望的α水平。

Conclusion: LRT-Diffusion是一种即插即用的推理时方法，为离线RL的扩散策略添加了原则性的、校准的风险控制。

Abstract: Diffusion policies are competitive for offline reinforcement learning (RL)
but are typically guided at sampling time by heuristics that lack a statistical
notion of risk. We introduce LRT-Diffusion, a risk-aware sampling rule that
treats each denoising step as a sequential hypothesis test between the
unconditional prior and the state-conditional policy head. Concretely, we
accumulate a log-likelihood ratio and gate the conditional mean with a logistic
controller whose threshold tau is calibrated once under H0 to meet a
user-specified Type-I level alpha. This turns guidance from a fixed push into
an evidence-driven adjustment with a user-interpretable risk budget.
Importantly, we deliberately leave training vanilla (two heads with standard
epsilon-prediction) under the structure of DDPM. LRT guidance composes
naturally with Q-gradients: critic-gradient updates can be taken at the
unconditional mean, at the LRT-gated mean, or a blend, exposing a continuum
from exploitation to conservatism. We standardize states and actions
consistently at train and test time and report a state-conditional
out-of-distribution (OOD) metric alongside return. On D4RL MuJoCo tasks,
LRT-Diffusion improves the return-OOD trade-off over strong Q-guided baselines
in our implementation while honoring the desired alpha. Theoretically, we
establish level-alpha calibration, concise stability bounds, and a return
comparison showing when LRT surpasses Q-guidance-especially when off-support
errors dominate. Overall, LRT-Diffusion is a drop-in, inference-time method
that adds principled, calibrated risk control to diffusion policies for offline
RL.

Abstract: In recent years, machine learning has become an increasingly powerful tool
for supporting seizure detection and monitoring in epilepsy care. Traditional
approaches focus on identifying seizures only after they begin, which limits
the opportunity for early intervention and proactive treatment. In this study,
we propose a novel approach that integrates both real-time seizure detection
and prediction, aiming to capture subtle temporal patterns in EEG data that may
indicate an upcoming seizure. Our approach was evaluated using the CHB-MIT
Scalp EEG Database, which includes 969 hours of recordings and 173 seizures
collected from 23 pediatric and young adult patients with drug-resistant
epilepsy. To support seizure detection, we implemented a range of supervised
machine learning algorithms, including K-Nearest Neighbors, Logistic
Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine. The Logistic Regression
achieved 90.9% detection accuracy with 89.6% recall, demonstrating balanced
performance suitable for clinical screening. Random Forest and Support Vector
Machine models achieved higher accuracy (94.0%) but with 0% recall, failing to
detect any seizures, illustrating that accuracy alone is insufficient for
evaluating medical ML models with class imbalance. For seizure prediction, we
employed Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, which use deep learning to
model temporal dependencies in EEG data. The LSTM model achieved 89.26%
prediction accuracy. These results highlight the potential of developing
accessible, real-time monitoring tools that not only detect seizures as
traditionally done, but also predict them before they occur. This ability to
predict seizures marks a significant shift from reactive seizure management to
a more proactive approach, allowing patients to anticipate seizures and take
precautionary measures to reduce the risk of injury or other complications.

Abstract: Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL) enhances the scalability of
decision-making in long-horizon tasks by introducing temporal abstraction
through options-policies that span multiple timesteps. Despite its theoretical
appeal, the practical implementation of HRL suffers from the challenge of
autonomously discovering semantically meaningful subgoals and learning optimal
option termination boundaries. This paper introduces a novel architecture that
integrates a self-supervised, Transformer-based Change Point Detection (CPD)
module into the Option-Critic framework, enabling adaptive segmentation of
state trajectories and the discovery of options. The CPD module is trained
using heuristic pseudo-labels derived from intrinsic signals to infer latent
shifts in environment dynamics without external supervision. These inferred
change-points are leveraged in three critical ways: (i) to serve as supervisory
signals for stabilizing termination function gradients, (ii) to pretrain
intra-option policies via segment-wise behavioral cloning, and (iii) to enforce
functional specialization through inter-option divergence penalties over
CPD-defined state partitions. The overall optimization objective enhances the
standard actor-critic loss using structure-aware auxiliary losses. In our
framework, option discovery arises naturally as CPD-defined trajectory segments
are mapped to distinct intra-option policies, enabling the agent to
autonomously partition its behavior into reusable, semantically meaningful
skills. Experiments on the Four-Rooms and Pinball tasks demonstrate that
CPD-guided agents exhibit accelerated convergence, higher cumulative returns,
and significantly improved option specialization. These findings confirm that
integrating structural priors via change-point segmentation leads to more
interpretable, sample-efficient, and robust hierarchical policies in complex

### [109] [What Really Matters in Matrix-Whitening Optimizers?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25000)
*Kevin Frans,Pieter Abbeel,Sergey Levine*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文系统分析了矩阵白化优化器的性能优势，发现方差自适应是解释性能差距的关键因素，而非仅靠准确的谱归一化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 近年来出现了多种近似矩阵白化变换的优化器，但对其性能优势的解释尚不明确。本文旨在解构这类优化器，识别真正影响性能的关键组件。

Method: 通过系统实验对比各种矩阵白化方法的性能，分析谱归一化和方差自适应两个组件的作用，并测试不同方差自适应策略的有效性。

Result: 所有矩阵白化方法都可靠地优于元素级优化器如Adam；方差自适应版本始终优于其符号下降对应版本；低秩方差估计器能有效降低内存成本且不损失性能。

Conclusion: 矩阵白化优化器的性能优势主要来自方差自适应组件，而非仅靠谱归一化；低秩方差估计是有效的内存优化策略。

Abstract: A range of recent optimizers have emerged that approximate the same
"matrix-whitening" transformation in various ways. In this work, we
systematically deconstruct such optimizers, aiming to disentangle the key
components that explain performance. Across tuned hyperparameters across the
board, all flavors of matrix-whitening methods reliably outperform elementwise
counterparts, such as Adam. Matrix-whitening is often related to spectral
descent -- however, experiments reveal that performance gains are *not
explained solely by accurate spectral normalization* -- particularly, SOAP
displays the largest per-step gain, even though Muon more accurately descends
along the steepest spectral descent direction. Instead, we argue that
matrix-whitening serves two purposes, and the variance adaptation component of
matrix-whitening is the overlooked ingredient explaining this performance gap.
Experiments show that variance-adapted versions of optimizers consistently
outperform their sign-descent counterparts, including an adaptive version of
Muon. We further ablate variance adaptation strategies, finding that while
lookahead style approximations are not as effective, low-rank variance
estimators can effectively reduce memory costs without a performance loss.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SPIRE是一个深度多编码器自编码器，用于将多区域神经数据分解为共享和私有潜在子空间，通过新颖的对齐和解缠损失来恢复跨区域结构并揭示外部扰动如何重组这些结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解耦共享网络级动态与区域特定活动是建模多区域神经数据的关键挑战。

Method: 引入SPIRE（共享-私有区域间编码器），使用深度多编码器自编码器，通过新颖的对齐和解缠损失将记录分解为共享和私有潜在子空间。

Result: 在具有真实潜在变量的合成基准测试中，SPIRE在非线性失真和时间错位下优于经典概率模型。应用于颅内深部脑刺激记录时，SPIRE显示共享潜在变量可靠地编码了跨位点和频率可泛化的刺激特异性特征。

Conclusion: SPIRE是分析刺激下多区域神经动态的实用、可复现工具。

Abstract: Disentangling shared network-level dynamics from region-specific activity is
a central challenge in modeling multi-region neural data. We introduce SPIRE
(Shared-Private Inter-Regional Encoder), a deep multi-encoder autoencoder that
factorizes recordings into shared and private latent subspaces with novel
alignment and disentanglement losses. Trained solely on baseline data, SPIRE
robustly recovers cross-regional structure and reveals how external
perturbations reorganize it. On synthetic benchmarks with ground-truth latents,
SPIRE outperforms classical probabilistic models under nonlinear distortions
and temporal misalignments. Applied to intracranial deep brain stimulation
(DBS) recordings, SPIRE shows that shared latents reliably encode
stimulation-specific signatures that generalize across sites and frequencies.
These results establish SPIRE as a practical, reproducible tool for analyzing
multi-region neural dynamics under stimulation.

TL;DR: 本研究系统评估了基于放射组学的机器学习模型在MRI序列分布偏移下的鲁棒性，发现协议不变特征训练模型在分布偏移下F1分数保持>0.85，而使用所有特征的模型性能下降40%。数据增强显著改善了不确定性估计质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 放射组学机器学习模型在临床决策支持中具有潜力，但容易受到成像协议、定位和分割变化引起的分布偏移影响，需要系统评估其鲁棒性。

Method: 使用16个水果体模，评估T2-HASTE、T2-TSE、T2-MAP、T1-TSE和T2-FLAIR序列的协议变化、分割变化（完整、部分、旋转）和观察者间变异性。训练XGBoost分类器比较8个一致稳健特征与序列特定特征。

Result: 协议不变特征训练的模型在分布偏移下F1分数保持>0.85，而使用所有特征的模型在协议变化下性能下降40%。数据增强使预期校准误差降低35%且不牺牲准确性。

Conclusion: 协议感知特征选择和受控体模研究能有效预测模型在分布偏移下的行为，为开发对真实世界协议变化具有鲁棒性的放射组学模型提供了框架。

Abstract: Radiomics-based machine learning models show promise for clinical decision
support but are vulnerable to distribution shifts caused by variations in
imaging protocols, positioning, and segmentation. This study systematically
investigates the robustness of radiomics-based machine learning models under
distribution shifts across five MRI sequences. We evaluated how different
acquisition protocols and segmentation strategies affect model reliability in
terms of predictive power and uncertainty-awareness. Using a phantom of 16
fruits, we evaluated distribution shifts through: (1) protocol variations
across T2-HASTE, T2-TSE, T2-MAP, T1-TSE, and T2-FLAIR sequences; (2)
segmentation variations (full, partial, rotated); and (3) inter-observer
variability. We trained XGBoost classifiers on 8 consistent robust features
versus sequence-specific features, testing model performance under in-domain
and out-of-domain conditions. Results demonstrate that models trained on
protocol-invariant features maintain F1-scores >0.85 across distribution
shifts, while models using all features showed 40% performance degradation
under protocol changes. Dataset augmentation substantially improved the quality
of uncertainty estimates and reduced the expected calibration error (ECE) by
35% without sacrificing accuracy. Temperature scaling provided minimal
calibration benefits, confirming XGBoost's inherent reliability. Our findings
reveal that protocol-aware feature selection and controlled phantom studies
effectively predict model behavior under distribution shifts, providing a
framework for developing robust radiomics models resilient to real-world
protocol variations.

Conclusion: 提出的图距离度量为评估因果发现方法在潜在混杂下的性能提供了新工具。

Abstract: Causal discovery aims to recover graphs that represent causal relations among
given variables from observations, and new methods are constantly being
proposed. Increasingly, the community raises questions about how much progress
is made, because properly evaluating discovered graphs remains notoriously
difficult, particularly under latent confounding. We propose a graph distance
measure for acyclic directed mixed graphs (ADMGs) based on the downstream task
of cause-effect estimation under unobserved confounding. Our approach uses
identification via fixing and a symbolic verifier to quantify how graph
differences distort cause-effect estimands for different treatment-outcome
pairs. We analyze the behavior of the measure under different graph
perturbations and compare it against existing distance metrics.

TL;DR: 提出DWMGrad优化算法，通过动态引导机制自适应调整动量和学习率，解决传统优化器在处理复杂模型和非凸优化时的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前深度学习研究中，SGD和Adam等优化算法在处理学习效率波动、复杂模型需求和非凸优化问题时存在明显不足，特别是在选择合适学习率、避免局部最优和高维空间导航方面。

Method: 基于传统方法，引入依赖历史数据的动态引导机制，动态更新动量和学习率，使优化器能灵活调整对历史信息的依赖，适应不同训练场景。

Result: 通过大量实验验证，DWMGrad在多种场景下能够实现更快的收敛速度和更高的准确率。

Conclusion: DWMGrad算法通过动态调整机制，显著提升了优化器对变化环境和任务复杂度的适应能力，在收敛性能和精度方面优于传统方法。

Abstract: Within the current sphere of deep learning research, despite the extensive
application of optimization algorithms such as Stochastic Gradient Descent
(SGD) and Adaptive Moment Estimation (Adam), there remains a pronounced
inadequacy in their capability to address fluctuations in learning efficiency,
meet the demands of complex models, and tackle non-convex optimization issues.
These challenges primarily arise from the algorithms' limitations in handling
complex data structures and models, for instance, difficulties in selecting an
appropriate learning rate, avoiding local optima, and navigating through
high-dimensional spaces. To address these issues, this paper introduces a novel
optimization algorithm named DWMGrad. This algorithm, building on the
foundations of traditional methods, incorporates a dynamic guidance mechanism
reliant on historical data to dynamically update momentum and learning rates.
This allows the optimizer to flexibly adjust its reliance on historical
information, adapting to various training scenarios. This strategy not only
enables the optimizer to better adapt to changing environments and task
complexities but also, as validated through extensive experimentation,
demonstrates DWMGrad's ability to achieve faster convergence rates and higher
accuracies under a multitude of scenarios.

Motivation: 研究旨在解决在无法访问计算图的网络结构中估计偏导数的挑战，探索如何通过集成黑盒函数来增强模型性能而不增加可训练参数数量。

Method: 提出Bounded Numerical Differentiation (BOND)方法，这是一种扰动性方法，通过将黑盒函数（实验中表现为固定的未训练网络）集成到可训练架构中来实现。

Result: 实验表明，使用固定的非训练模块可以增强模型性能，且不需要对黑盒函数的架构或属性进行大量优化，实现了模型容量的扩展。

Conclusion: 研究展示了利用固定非训练模块扩展模型容量的潜力，为结合模拟和数字设备作为网络扩展机制提供了可行路径。

Abstract: We introduce Bounded Numerical Differentiation (BOND), a perturbative method
for estimating partial derivatives across network structures with inaccessible
computational graphs. BOND demonstrates improved accuracy and scalability from
existing perturbative methods, enabling new explorations of trainable
architectures that integrate black-box functions. We observe that these
black-box functions, realized in our experiments as fixed, untrained networks,
can enhance model performance without increasing the number of trainable
parameters. This improvement is achieved without extensive optimization of the
architecture or properties of the black-box function itself. Our findings
highlight the potential of leveraging fixed, non-trainable modules to expand
model capacity, suggesting a path toward combining analogue and digital devices
as a mechanism for scaling networks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FairMIB是一个多视图信息瓶颈框架，通过分解图的特征、结构和扩散视图来缓解GNN中的复杂性偏见，使用对比学习和多视角条件信息瓶颈目标来平衡任务效用和公平性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GNN在处理关系数据时可能放大训练数据偏见，传播歧视性属性和结构不平衡到不公平结果中。现有公平性方法通常将偏见视为单一来源，忽略了属性和结构效应的区别，导致公平性和效用的次优权衡。

Method: 提出FairMIB框架：1）将图分解为特征、结构和扩散三个视图；2）使用对比学习最大化跨视图互信息进行无偏见表示学习；3）集成多视角条件信息瓶颈目标最小化与敏感属性的互信息；4）在扩散视图中引入逆概率加权邻接校正减少偏见传播。

Result: 在五个真实世界基准数据集上的实验表明，FairMIB在效用和公平性指标上都达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: FairMIB通过多视图分解和信息瓶颈方法有效缓解了GNN中的偏见传播问题，在保持任务效用的同时显著提升了公平性表现。

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) excel on relational data by passing messages
over node features and structure, but they can amplify training data biases,
propagating discriminatory attributes and structural imbalances into unfair
outcomes. Many fairness methods treat bias as a single source, ignoring
distinct attribute and structure effects and leading to suboptimal fairness and
utility trade-offs. To overcome this challenge, we propose FairMIB, a
multi-view information bottleneck framework designed to decompose graphs into
feature, structural, and diffusion views for mitigating complexity biases in
GNNs. Especially, the proposed FairMIB employs contrastive learning to maximize
cross-view mutual information for bias-free representation learning. It further
integrates multi-perspective conditional information bottleneck objectives to
balance task utility and fairness by minimizing mutual information with
sensitive attributes. Additionally, FairMIB introduces an inverse
probability-weighted (IPW) adjacency correction in the diffusion view, which
reduces the spread of bias propagation during message passing. Experiments on
five real-world benchmark datasets demonstrate that FairMIB achieves
state-of-the-art performance across both utility and fairness metrics.

Motivation: 探索训练和测试分布比例不匹配对模型性能的影响，挑战传统认为分布匹配最优的观点。

Method: 分析混合分布场景，识别最优训练比例，并扩展到组合设置中不同组件"技能"分布的情况。

Result: 发现分布偏移在某些设置中普遍有益，测试性能可能因训练比例不匹配而提升，确定了最优训练比例和分布偏移的益处程度。

Conclusion: 分布偏移在某些情况下是有益的，训练和测试比例不匹配可以改善模型性能，这一发现适用于混合分布和组合技能分布的场景。

Abstract: We consider training and testing on mixture distributions with different
training and test proportions. We show that in many settings, and in some sense
generically, distribution shift can be beneficial, and test performance can
improve due to mismatched training proportions, even if the components are
unrelated and with no transfer between components. In a variety of scenarios,
we identify the optimal training proportions and the extent to which such
distribution shift can be beneficial. We show how the same analysis applies
also to a compositional setting with differing distribution of component
"skills'' at training and test.

Conclusion: 神经微分流形代表了向几何结构化、可解释且高效深度学习系统的根本性转变，尽管仍存在显著计算挑战

Abstract: This paper introduces the Neural Differential Manifold (NDM), a novel neural
network architecture that explicitly incorporates geometric structure into its
fundamental design. Departing from conventional Euclidean parameter spaces, the
NDM re-conceptualizes a neural network as a differentiable manifold where each
layer functions as a local coordinate chart, and the network parameters
directly parameterize a Riemannian metric tensor at every point. The
architecture is organized into three synergistic layers: a Coordinate Layer
implementing smooth chart transitions via invertible transformations inspired
by normalizing flows, a Geometric Layer that dynamically generates the
manifold's metric through auxiliary sub-networks, and an Evolution Layer that
optimizes both task performance and geometric simplicity through a
dual-objective loss function. This geometric regularization penalizes excessive
curvature and volume distortion, providing intrinsic regularization that
enhances generalization and robustness. The framework enables natural gradient
descent optimization aligned with the learned manifold geometry and offers
unprecedented interpretability by endowing internal representations with clear
geometric meaning. We analyze the theoretical advantages of this approach,
including its potential for more efficient optimization, enhanced continual
learning, and applications in scientific discovery and controllable generative
modeling. While significant computational challenges remain, the Neural
Differential Manifold represents a fundamental shift towards geometrically
structured, interpretable, and efficient deep learning systems.

Conclusion: δ度量可用于所提出的聚类模型对抗学习双层模型中，为对抗攻击效果衡量提供了理论基础。

Abstract: Adversarial learning has been attracting more and more attention thanks to
the fast development of machine learning and artificial intelligence. However,
due to the complicated structure of most machine learning models, the mechanism
of adversarial attacks is not well interpreted. How to measure the effect of
attack is still not quite clear. In this paper, we propose a unified bilevel
model for adversarial learning. We further investigate the adversarial attack
in clustering models and interpret it from data perturbation point of view. We
reveal that when the data perturbation is relatively small, the clustering
model is robust, whereas if it is relatively large, the clustering result
changes, which leads to an attack. To measure the effect of attacks for
clustering models, we analyse the well-definedness of the so-called
$\delta$-measure, which can be used in the proposed bilevel model for
adversarial learning of clustering models.

Motivation: 现实世界数据集通常同时具有序列性和关系性，但现有方法往往忽视其中一个模态。作者认为序列和图不是分离的问题，而是同一数据集的互补方面，应该联合学习。

Abstract: Many real-world datasets are both sequential and relational: each node
carries an event sequence while edges encode interactions. Existing methods in
sequence modeling and graph modeling often neglect one modality or the other.
We argue that sequences and graphs are not separate problems but complementary
facets of the same dataset, and should be learned jointly. We introduce BRIDGE,
a unified end-to-end architecture that couples a sequence encoder with a GNN
under a single objective, allowing gradients to flow across both modules and
learning task-aligned representations. To enable fine-grained token-level
message passing among neighbors, we add TOKENXATTN, a token-level
cross-attention layer that passes messages between events in neighboring
sequences. Across two settings, friendship prediction (Brightkite) and fraud
detection (Amazon), BRIDGE consistently outperforms static GNNs, temporal graph
methods, and sequence-only baselines on ranking and classification metrics.

Motivation: 传统数据增强主要用于i.i.d.设置的正则化，但作者希望将其扩展到跨干预的泛化。由于工具变量在许多应用中不易获得，而数据增强更易获取，因此探索数据增强在因果推断中的潜在应用价值。

Method: 通过适当正则化基于工具变量的估计器，引入IV-like回归概念，即使某些工具变量属性放宽时也能减轻混杂偏差。将参数化数据增强建模为IV-like回归问题，并通过组合使用模拟最坏情况的数据增强应用。

Result: 理论和模拟实验表明，该方法在因果估计和泛化任务上的表现优于简单数据增强。在线性示例的有限样本情况下和真实数据实验中均验证了有效性。

Conclusion: 数据增强可有效用于超越i.i.d.设置的因果推断，通过将其视为干预并构建IV-like回归框架，能够改善因果效应估计和跨干预泛化性能。

Abstract: The technique of data augmentation (DA) is often used in machine learning for
regularization purposes to better generalize under i.i.d. settings. In this
work, we present a unifying framework with topics in causal inference to make a
case for the use of DA beyond just the i.i.d. setting, but for generalization
across interventions as well. Specifically, we argue that when the outcome
generating mechanism is invariant to our choice of DA, then such augmentations
can effectively be thought of as interventions on the treatment generating
mechanism itself. This can potentially help to reduce bias in causal effect
estimation arising from hidden confounders. In the presence of such unobserved
confounding we typically make use of instrumental variables (IVs) -- sources of
treatment randomization that are conditionally independent of the outcome.
However, IVs may not be as readily available as DA for many applications, which
is the main motivation behind this work. By appropriately regularizing IV based
estimators, we introduce the concept of IV-like (IVL) regression for mitigating
confounding bias and improving predictive performance across interventions even
when certain IV properties are relaxed. Finally, we cast parameterized DA as an
IVL regression problem and show that when used in composition can simulate a
worst-case application of such DA, further improving performance on causal
estimation and generalization tasks beyond what simple DA may offer. This is
shown both theoretically for the population case and via simulation experiments
for the finite sample case using a simple linear example. We also present real
data experiments to support our case.

Conclusion: 线性嫁接通过消除非线性激活函数中的近似误差，能够有效收紧局部Lipschitz常数，从而改善认证鲁棒性。

Abstract: Lipschitz constant is a fundamental property in certified robustness, as
smaller values imply robustness to adversarial examples when a model is
confident in its prediction. However, identifying the worst-case adversarial
examples is known to be an NP-complete problem. Although over-approximation
methods have shown success in neural network verification to address this
challenge, reducing approximation errors remains a significant obstacle.
Furthermore, these approximation errors hinder the ability to obtain tight
local Lipschitz constants, which are crucial for certified robustness.
Originally, grafting linearity into non-linear activation functions was
proposed to reduce the number of unstable neurons, enabling scalable and
complete verification. However, no prior theoretical analysis has explained how
linearity grafting improves certified robustness. We instead consider linearity
grafting primarily as a means of eliminating approximation errors rather than
reducing the number of unstable neurons, since linear functions do not require
relaxation. In this paper, we provide two theoretical contributions: 1) why
linearity grafting improves certified robustness through the lens of the
$l_\infty$ local Lipschitz constant, and 2) grafting linearity into non-linear
activation functions, the dominant source of approximation errors, yields a
tighter local Lipschitz constant. Based on these theoretical contributions, we
propose a Lipschitz-aware linearity grafting method that removes dominant
approximation errors, which are crucial for tightening the local Lipschitz
constant, thereby improving certified robustness, even without certified
training. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that grafting linearity into
these influential activations tightens the $l_\infty$ local Lipschitz constant
and enhances certified robustness.

Abstract: To mitigate acute wildfire ignition risks, utilities de-energize power lines
in high-risk areas. The Optimal Power Shutoff (OPS) problem optimizes line
energization statuses to manage wildfire ignition risks through
de-energizations while reducing load shedding. OPS problems are computationally
challenging Mixed-Integer Linear Programs (MILPs) that must be solved rapidly
and frequently in operational settings. For a particular power system, OPS
instances share a common structure with varying parameters related to wildfire
risks, loads, and renewable generation. This motivates the use of Machine
Learning (ML) for solving OPS problems by exploiting shared patterns across
instances. In this paper, we develop an ML-guided framework that quickly
produces high-quality de-energization decisions by extending existing ML-guided
MILP solution methods while integrating domain knowledge on the number of
energized and de-energized lines. Results on a large-scale realistic
California-based synthetic test system show that the proposed ML-guided method
produces high-quality solutions faster than traditional optimization methods.

Abstract: In the rapidly evolving research on artificial intelligence (AI) the demand
for fast, computationally efficient, and scalable solutions has increased in
recent years. The problem of optimizing the computing resources for distributed
machine learning (ML) and optimization is considered in this paper. Given a set
of data distributed over a network of computing-nodes/servers, the idea is to
optimally assign the CPU (central processing unit) usage while simultaneously
training each computing node locally via its own share of data. This formulates
the problem as a co-optimization setup to (i) optimize the data processing and
(ii) optimally allocate the computing resources. The information-sharing
network among the nodes might be time-varying, but with balanced weights to
ensure consensus-type convergence of the algorithm. The algorithm is all-time
feasible, which implies that the computing resource-demand balance constraint
holds at all iterations of the proposed solution. Moreover, the solution allows
addressing possible log-scale quantization over the information-sharing
channels to exchange log-quantized data. For some example applications,
distributed support-vector-machine (SVM) and regression are considered as the
ML training models. Results from perturbation theory, along with Lyapunov
stability and eigen-spectrum analysis, are used to prove the convergence
towards the optimal case. As compared to existing CPU scheduling solutions, the
proposed algorithm improves the cost optimality gap by more than $50\%$.

Method: 采用选择性学习策略，通过不确定性掩码（利用残差熵）和异常掩码（利用残差下界估计）筛选时间步子集来计算MSE损失。

Result: 在8个真实世界数据集上的实验表明，该方法显著提升了主流深度模型的预测性能，如Informer的MSE降低37.4%，TimesNet降低8.4%，iTransformer降低6.5%。

Conclusion: 选择性学习策略能有效指导模型关注可泛化时间步，显著改善深度时间序列预测模型的性能。

Abstract: Benefiting from high capacity for capturing complex temporal patterns, deep
learning (DL) has significantly advanced time series forecasting (TSF).
However, deep models tend to suffer from severe overfitting due to the inherent
vulnerability of time series to noise and anomalies. The prevailing DL paradigm
uniformly optimizes all timesteps through the MSE loss and learns those
uncertain and anomalous timesteps without difference, ultimately resulting in
overfitting. To address this, we propose a novel selective learning strategy
for deep TSF. Specifically, selective learning screens a subset of the whole
timesteps to calculate the MSE loss in optimization, guiding the model to focus
on generalizable timesteps while disregarding non-generalizable ones. Our
framework introduces a dual-mask mechanism to target timesteps: (1) an
uncertainty mask leveraging residual entropy to filter uncertain timesteps, and
(2) an anomaly mask employing residual lower bound estimation to exclude
anomalous timesteps. Extensive experiments across eight real-world datasets
demonstrate that selective learning can significantly improve the predictive
performance for typical state-of-the-art deep models, including 37.4% MSE
reduction for Informer, 8.4% for TimesNet, and 6.5% for iTransformer.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于自适应损失加权的成本敏感多类PU学习方法，通过为正向和推断负向损失分量分配不同的数据依赖权重，实现无偏风险估计，在多个数据集上表现出优越性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多类PU学习面临挑战，现有方法无法保证无偏风险估计，限制了性能和稳定性。现实应用中标注可靠负样本困难或成本高，需要有效的多类PU学习方法。

Method: 在经验风险最小化框架下，为正向和从未标记混合数据中推断的负向损失分量分配不同的数据依赖权重，使经验目标成为目标风险的无偏估计器。

Result: 在8个公共数据集上的广泛实验表明，在不同类别先验和类别数量的情况下，相比强基线方法在准确性和稳定性方面均取得一致提升。

Conclusion: 提出的自适应损失加权方法为多类PU学习提供了有效的无偏风险估计框架，在多个数据集上验证了其优越性能。

Abstract: Positive--Unlabeled (PU) learning considers settings in which only positive
and unlabeled data are available, while negatives are missing or left
unlabeled. This situation is common in real applications where annotating
reliable negatives is difficult or costly. Despite substantial progress in PU
learning, the multi-class case (MPU) remains challenging: many existing
approaches do not ensure \emph{unbiased risk estimation}, which limits
performance and stability. We propose a cost-sensitive multi-class PU method
based on \emph{adaptive loss weighting}. Within the empirical risk minimization
framework, we assign distinct, data-dependent weights to the positive and
\emph{inferred-negative} (from the unlabeled mixture) loss components so that
the resulting empirical objective is an unbiased estimator of the target risk.
We formalize the MPU data-generating process and establish a generalization
error bound for the proposed estimator. Extensive experiments on \textbf{eight}
public datasets, spanning varying class priors and numbers of classes, show
consistent gains over strong baselines in both accuracy and stability.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了BSFA框架，通过差异化缩放不同子空间的更新分量来加速深度学习训练：在主导子空间抑制更新以增强稳定性，在Bulk子空间放大更新以提升收敛速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究表明深度学习优化中存在二分现象：沿损失Hessian矩阵顶部特征方向的更新幅度大但对损失减少贡献小，而正交分量的更新幅度小但驱动大部分学习进展。

Method: 提出BSFA框架，使用PCA对历史更新进行高效子空间估计，并采用分块策略在参数块级别应用该估计，差异化缩放不同子空间的更新分量。

Result: 在多个任务上实现加速，特别是在LLaMA-72M和LLaMA-134M预训练中相比AdamW实现了约2倍的加速。

Conclusion: BSFA是一个实用且可扩展的即插即用框架，能有效加速深度学习训练过程。

Abstract: Recent studies \citep{gur2018gradient,song2024does, wen2024understanding}
highlight a fundamental dichotomy in deep learning optimization: Although
parameter updates along the top eigendirections of the loss Hessian (Dom-space)
capture most of the update magnitude, they often contribute minimally to loss
reduction. In contrast, updates in the orthogonal component (Bulk-space) have
smaller magnitudes but drive most learning progress. In this work, we further
advance the understanding of this phenomenon and introduce the
\textbf{Bulk-Space-Filtration-Accelerator (BSFA)}, a novel plug-and-play
framework. BSFA accelerates training by differentially scaling update
components projected onto these distinct subspaces, simultaneously enhancing
stability by moderating updates in the dominant subspace and boosting
convergence speed by amplifying those in the bulk-space. To ensure BSFA is both
practical and scalable for contemporary large models, we introduce two key
innovations: an efficient estimator using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on
historical updates for fast subspace estimation, and a block-wise strategy that
applies this estimation on a per-parameter-block basis. These designs make BSFA
computationally tractable and highly effective. We demonstrate BSFA's
acceleration across various tasks, notably achieving approximately 2$\times$
speedup when pre-training LLaMA-72M on WikiText-103 and LLaMA-134M on
OpenWebText compared to vanilla AdamW.

Abstract: Bayesian inference of Bayesian network structures is often performed by
sampling directed acyclic graphs along an appropriately constructed Markov
chain. We present two techniques to improve sampling. First, we give an
efficient implementation of basic moves, which add, delete, or reverse a single
arc. Second, we expedite summing over parent sets, an expensive task required
for more sophisticated moves: we devise a preprocessing method to prune
possible parent sets so as to approximately preserve the sums. Our empirical
study shows that our techniques can yield substantial efficiency gains compared
to previous methods.

TL;DR: 提出IB-Inspired Normalization (IBNorm)，一种基于信息瓶颈原理的归一化方法，相比传统方差中心化方法能更好地保留预测信息并抑制无用变异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有归一化方法如BatchNorm、LayerNorm和RMSNorm主要关注方差中心化，但缺乏对任务相关信息捕获的控制，无法有效区分有用信息和噪声。

Method: IBNorm引入有界压缩操作，基于信息瓶颈原理鼓励嵌入保留预测信息同时抑制无用变异，保持标准归一化的稳定性和兼容性。

Result: 在大型语言模型(LLaMA、GPT-2)和视觉模型(ResNet、ViT)上，IBNorm持续优于BatchNorm、LayerNorm和RMSNorm，互信息分析确认了更好的信息瓶颈行为。

Conclusion: IBNorm在理论和实证上都优于传统方差中心化归一化方法，能产生更具信息量的表示，同时保持训练稳定性。

Abstract: Normalization is fundamental to deep learning, but existing approaches such
as BatchNorm, LayerNorm, and RMSNorm are variance-centric by enforcing zero
mean and unit variance, stabilizing training without controlling how
representations capture task-relevant information. We propose IB-Inspired
Normalization (IBNorm), a simple yet powerful family of methods grounded in the
Information Bottleneck principle. IBNorm introduces bounded compression
operations that encourage embeddings to preserve predictive information while
suppressing nuisance variability, yielding more informative representations
while retaining the stability and compatibility of standard normalization.
Theoretically, we prove that IBNorm achieves a higher IB value and tighter
generalization bounds than variance-centric methods. Empirically, IBNorm
consistently outperforms BatchNorm, LayerNorm, and RMSNorm across large-scale
language models (LLaMA, GPT-2) and vision models (ResNet, ViT), with mutual
information analysis confirming superior information bottleneck behavior. Code
will be released publicly.

Abstract: Deep learning has achieved remarkable success across a wide range of tasks,
but its models often suffer from instability and vulnerability: small changes
to the input may drastically affect predictions, while optimization can be
hindered by sharp loss landscapes. This thesis addresses these issues through
the unifying perspective of sensitivity analysis, which examines how neural
networks respond to perturbations at both the input and parameter levels.
  We study Lipschitz networks as a principled way to constrain sensitivity to
input perturbations, thereby improving generalization, adversarial robustness,
and training stability. To complement this architectural approach, we introduce
regularization techniques based on the curvature of the loss function,
promoting smoother optimization landscapes and reducing sensitivity to
parameter variations. Randomized smoothing is also explored as a probabilistic
method for enhancing robustness at decision boundaries.
  By combining these perspectives, we develop a unified framework where
Lipschitz continuity, randomized smoothing, and curvature regularization
interact to address fundamental challenges in stability. The thesis contributes
both theoretical analysis and practical methodologies, including efficient
spectral norm computation, novel Lipschitz-constrained layers, and improved
certification procedures.

Abstract: Modeling complex spatiotemporal dynamics, particularly in
far-from-equilibrium systems, remains a grand challenge in science. The
governing partial differential equations (PDEs) for these systems are often
intractable to derive from first principles, due to their inherent complexity,
characterized by high-order derivatives and strong nonlinearities, coupled with
incomplete physical knowledge. This has spurred the development of data-driven
methods, yet these approaches face limitations: Purely data-driven models are
often physically inconsistent and data-intensive, while existing
physics-informed methods lack the structural capacity to represent complex
operators or systematically integrate partial physical knowledge. Here, we
propose a hierarchical physics-embedded learning framework that fundamentally
advances both the forward spatiotemporal prediction and inverse discovery of
physical laws from sparse and noisy data. The key innovation is a two-level
architecture that mirrors the process of scientific discovery: the first level
learns fundamental symbolic components of a PDE, while the second learns their
governing combinations. This hierarchical decomposition not only reduces
learning complexity but, more importantly, enables a structural integration of
prior knowledge. Known physical laws are directly embedded into the models
computational graph, guaranteeing physical consistency and improving data
efficiency. By building the framework upon adaptive Fourier Neural Operators,
we can effectively capture the non-local dependencies and high-order operators
characteristic of dynamical systems. Additionally, by structurally decoupling
known and unknown terms, the framework further enables interpretable discovery
of underlying governing equations through symbolic regression, without
presupposing functional forms.

TL;DR: 提出了一种多目标强化学习算法，在最大化期望回报的同时，确保策略在目标状态上的边际状态分布均匀分散。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统强化学习算法主要关注最大化期望回报，可能导致策略只利用少数奖励源。但在许多自然场景中，需要学习既能最大化回报又能均匀访问所有目标状态的策略。现有方法如熵正则化和内在奖励主要鼓励探索找到最优策略，但不一定能确保在目标状态上的分散分布。

Result: 在合成MDP和标准RL环境中进行实验，验证了算法的有效性。证明了算法在优化目标函数时的有效收敛边界。

Conclusion: 该算法能够学习到高回报的策略混合，同时确保在目标状态上的边际状态分布均匀分散，解决了传统RL算法在分散访问目标状态方面的局限性。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning algorithms are primarily focused on learning a policy
that maximizes expected return. As a result, the learned policy can exploit one
or few reward sources. However, in many natural situations, it is desirable to
learn a policy that induces a dispersed marginal state distribution over
rewarding states, while maximizing the expected return which is typically tied
to reaching a goal state. This aspect remains relatively unexplored. Existing
techniques based on entropy regularization and intrinsic rewards use
stochasticity for encouraging exploration to find an optimal policy which may
not necessarily lead to dispersed marginal state distribution over rewarding
states. Other RL algorithms which match a target distribution assume the latter
to be available apriori. This may be infeasible in large scale systems where
enumeration of all states is not possible and a state is determined to be a
goal state only upon reaching it. We formalize the problem of maximizing the
expected return while uniformly visiting the goal states as Multi Goal RL in
which an oracle classifier over the state space determines the goal states. We
propose a novel algorithm that learns a high-return policy mixture with
marginal state distribution dispersed over the set of goal states. Our
algorithm is based on optimizing a custom RL reward which is computed - based
on the current policy mixture - at each iteration for a set of sampled
trajectories. The latter are used via an offline RL algorithm to update the
policy mixture. We prove performance guarantees for our algorithm, showing
efficient convergence bounds for optimizing a natural objective which captures
the expected return as well as the dispersion of the marginal state
distribution over the goal states. We design and perform experiments on
synthetic MDPs and standard RL environments to evaluate the effectiveness of
our algorithm.

Abstract: Normalizing flows are deep generative models that enable efficient likelihood
estimation and sampling through invertible transformations. A key challenge is
to design linear layers that enhance expressiveness while maintaining efficient
computation of the Jacobian determinant and inverse. We introduce a novel
invertible linear layer based on the product of circulant and diagonal
matrices. This decomposition reduces parameter complexity from
$\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ to $\mathcal{O}(mn)$ using $m$ diagonal matrices and $m-1$
circulant matrices while still approximating general linear transformations. By
leveraging the Fast Fourier Transform, our approach reduces the time complexity
of matrix inversion from $\mathcal{O}(n^3)$ to $\mathcal{O}(mn\log n)$ and that
of computing the log-determinant from $\mathcal{O}(n^3)$ to $\mathcal{O}(mn)$,
where $n$ is the input dimension. We build upon this layer to develop
Circulant-Diagonal Flow (CDFlow), which achieves strong density estimation on
natural image datasets and effectively models data with inherent periodic
structure. Furthermore, CDFlow significantly accelerates key operations in
normalizing flows, providing practical benefits for scalable generative
modeling.

Abstract: Information cascade popularity prediction is a key problem in analyzing
content diffusion in social networks. However, current related works suffer
from three critical limitations: (1) temporal leakage in current
evaluation--random cascade-based splits allow models to access future
information, yielding unrealistic results; (2) feature-poor datasets that lack
downstream conversion signals (e.g., likes, comments, or purchases), which
limits more practical applications; (3) computational inefficiency of complex
graph-based methods that require days of training for marginal gains. We
systematically address these challenges from three perspectives: task setup,
dataset construction, and model design. First, we propose a time-ordered
splitting strategy that chronologically partitions data into consecutive
windows, ensuring models are evaluated on genuine forecasting tasks without
future information leakage. Second, we introduce Taoke, a large-scale
e-commerce cascade dataset featuring rich promoter/product attributes and
ground-truth purchase conversions--capturing the complete diffusion lifecycle
from promotion to monetization. Third, we develop CasTemp, a lightweight
framework that efficiently models cascade dynamics through temporal walks,
Jaccard-based neighbor selection for inter-cascade dependencies, and GRU-based
encoding with time-aware attention. Under leak-free evaluation, CasTemp
achieves state-of-the-art performance across four datasets with
orders-of-magnitude speedup. Notably, it excels at predicting second-stage
popularity conversions--a practical task critical for real-world applications.

Abstract: Hypergraphs provide a natural framework for modeling higher-order

of Laplacians from skeleton graphs for multiscale smoothness. HOHL converges to
a higher-order Sobolev seminorm. Empirically, it performs strongly on standard
baselines.

Abstract: Ensemble methods are widely employed to improve generalization in machine
learning. This has also prompted the adoption of ensemble learning for the
knowledge graph embedding (KGE) models in performing link prediction. Typical
approaches to this end train multiple models as part of the ensemble, and the
diverse predictions are then averaged. However, this approach has some
significant drawbacks. For instance, the computational overhead of training
multiple models increases latency and memory overhead. In contrast, model
merging approaches offer a promising alternative that does not require training
multiple models. In this work, we introduce model merging, specifically
weighted averaging, in KGE models. Herein, a running average of model
parameters from a training epoch onward is maintained and used for predictions.
To address this, we additionally propose an approach that selectively updates
the running average of the ensemble model parameters only when the
generalization performance improves on a validation dataset. We evaluate these
two different weighted averaging approaches on link prediction tasks, comparing
the state-of-the-art benchmark ensemble approach. Additionally, we evaluate the
weighted averaging approach considering literal-augmented KGE models and
multi-hop query answering tasks as well. The results demonstrate that the
proposed weighted averaging approach consistently improves performance across
diverse evaluation settings.

Conclusion: 利用损失函数从非凸到凸的转换特性设计的混合优化算法在实践中能有效提升性能，证明了该假设的实用价值。

Abstract: The key task of machine learning is to minimize the loss function that
measures the model fit to the training data. The numerical methods to do this
efficiently depend on the properties of the loss function. The most decisive
among these properties is the convexity or non-convexity of the loss function.
The fact that the loss function can have, and frequently has, non-convex
regions has led to a widespread commitment to non-convex methods such as Adam.
However, a local minimum implies that, in some environment around it, the
function is convex. In this environment, second-order minimizing methods such
as the Conjugate Gradient (CG) give a guaranteed superlinear convergence. We
propose a novel framework grounded in the hypothesis that loss functions in
real-world tasks swap from initial non-convexity to convexity towards the
optimum. This is a property we leverage to design an innovative two-phase
optimization algorithm. The presented algorithm detects the swap point by
observing the gradient norm dependence on the loss. In these regions,
non-convex (Adam) and convex (CG) algorithms are used, respectively. Computing
experiments confirm the hypothesis that this simple convexity structure is
frequent enough to be practically exploited to substantially improve
convergence and accuracy.

Conclusion: BIML不应被视为PIML的替代品，而是其方法的重新调整，为高科学和社会相关性的挑战提供PIML启发的创新方向，并提出了构建BIML生态系统的具体建议。

Abstract: Physics-Informed Machine Learning (PIML) has successfully integrated
mechanistic understanding into machine learning, particularly in domains
governed by well-known physical laws. This success has motivated efforts to
apply PIML to biology, a field rich in dynamical systems but shaped by
different constraints. Biological modeling, however, presents unique
challenges: multi-faceted and uncertain prior knowledge, heterogeneous and
noisy data, partial observability, and complex, high-dimensional networks. In
this position paper, we argue that these challenges should not be seen as
obstacles to PIML, but as catalysts for its evolution. We propose
Biology-Informed Machine Learning (BIML): a principled extension of PIML that
retains its structural grounding while adapting to the practical realities of
biology. Rather than replacing PIML, BIML retools its methods to operate under
softer, probabilistic forms of prior knowledge. We outline four foundational
pillars as a roadmap for this transition: uncertainty quantification,
contextualization, constrained latent structure inference, and scalability.
Foundation Models and Large Language Models will be key enablers, bridging
human expertise with computational modeling. We conclude with concrete
recommendations to build the BIML ecosystem and channel PIML-inspired
innovation toward challenges of high scientific and societal relevance.

TL;DR: GPTOpt是一种基于大语言模型的优化方法，通过在大规模合成数据集上微调LLM，使其具备连续黑盒优化能力，无需参数调优即可超越传统优化器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统贝叶斯优化需要针对每个应用领域进行参数调优，而现有LLM在连续黑盒优化任务上能力有限，需要开发能够泛化到不同优化任务的LLM优化方法。

Method: 在大规模合成数据集上微调大语言模型，这些数据集来自多样化的贝叶斯优化参数配置，利用LLM预训练实现跨优化任务的泛化。

Result: 在各种黑盒优化基准测试中，GPTOpt超越了传统优化器，展示了LLM在高级数值推理方面的能力。

Conclusion: GPTOpt为无需参数调优的全局优化提供了一个灵活框架，证明了LLM在连续黑盒优化任务上的潜力。

Abstract: Global optimization of expensive, derivative-free black-box functions demands
extreme sample efficiency. Classical methods such as Bayesian Optimization (BO)
can be effective, but they often require careful parameter tuning to each
application domain. At the same time, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown
broad capabilities, yet state-of-the-art models remain limited in solving
continuous black-box optimization tasks. We introduce GPTOpt, an LLM-based
optimization method that equips LLMs with continuous black-box optimization
capabilities. By fine-tuning large language models on extensive synthetic
datasets derived from diverse BO parameterizations, GPTOpt leverages LLM
pre-training to generalize across optimization tasks. On a variety of black-box
optimization benchmarks, GPTOpt surpasses traditional optimizers, highlighting
the capacity of LLMs for advanced numerical reasoning and introducing a
flexible framework for global optimization without parameter tuning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了效用校准框架，通过特定效用函数来评估多分类校准误差，统一和重新解释了现有校准指标，支持更鲁棒的top-class和class-wise校准评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多分类校准评估方法要么关注预测的特定方面（如top-class置信度、class-wise校准），要么使用计算复杂的变分公式，需要可扩展的校准评估框架。

Method: 提出效用校准框架，通过定义特定效用函数来封装终端用户的目标或决策标准，从而测量相对校准误差。

Result: 该框架能够统一和重新解释现有校准指标，特别是支持更鲁棒的top-class和class-wise校准指标，并扩展到更丰富的下游效用类别评估。

Conclusion: 效用校准提供了一个通用且可扩展的多分类校准评估框架，能够根据具体应用需求定制校准评估标准。

Abstract: Ensuring that classifiers are well-calibrated, i.e., their predictions align
with observed frequencies, is a minimal and fundamental requirement for
classifiers to be viewed as trustworthy. Existing methods for assessing
multiclass calibration often focus on specific aspects associated with
prediction (e.g., top-class confidence, class-wise calibration) or utilize
computationally challenging variational formulations. In this work, we study
scalable \emph{evaluation} of multiclass calibration. To this end, we propose
utility calibration, a general framework that measures the calibration error
relative to a specific utility function that encapsulates the goals or decision
criteria relevant to the end user. We demonstrate how this framework can unify
and re-interpret several existing calibration metrics, particularly allowing
for more robust versions of the top-class and class-wise calibration metrics,
and, going beyond such binarized approaches, toward assessing calibration for
richer classes of downstream utilities.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了梯度权重对齐(GWA)指标，通过量化每个样本梯度与模型权重之间的一致性来跟踪泛化能力，无需验证集即可预测最优早停点、进行模型比较和识别有影响力的训练样本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在深度学习领域，需要稳健的验证指标来检测过拟合和监控训练动态，特别是在监督分类任务中，探索训练数据与模型权重之间的交互能否提供这样的指标。

Method: 引入梯度权重对齐(GWA)方法，计算每个样本梯度与模型权重之间的一致性程度，有效学习对应一致的对齐，而错位则表明泛化能力下降。

Result: 大量实验表明，GWA能够准确预测最优早停点，支持有原则的模型比较，并识别有影响力的训练样本，提供了一种无需验证集的模型分析方法。

Conclusion: GWA提供了一种直接从训练数据中分析模型的验证集无关方法，能够有效跟踪泛化能力并识别关键训练样本。

Abstract: Robust validation metrics remain essential in contemporary deep learning, not
only to detect overfitting and poor generalization, but also to monitor
training dynamics. In the supervised classification setting, we investigate
whether interactions between training data and model weights can yield such a
metric that both tracks generalization during training and attributes
performance to individual training samples. We introduce Gradient-Weight
Alignment (GWA), quantifying the coherence between per-sample gradients and
model weights. We show that effective learning corresponds to coherent
alignment, while misalignment indicates deteriorating generalization. GWA is
efficiently computable during training and reflects both sample-specific
contributions and dataset-wide learning dynamics. Extensive experiments show
that GWA accurately predicts optimal early stopping, enables principled model
comparisons, and identifies influential training samples, providing a
validation-set-free approach for model analysis directly from the training
data.

Motivation: 现有神经符号AI模型容易学习推理捷径，即利用伪相关性而非正确概念来满足符号约束，这影响了模型的可靠性和安全性。

Method: 引入原型神经符号架构，结合原型学习理论，训练模型在满足背景知识的同时考虑输入与少量标注数据点的相似性，从而避免推理捷径。

Abstract: Neurosymbolic AI is growing in popularity thanks to its ability to combine
neural perception and symbolic reasoning in end-to-end trainable models.
However, recent findings reveal these are prone to shortcut reasoning, i.e., to
learning unindented concepts--or neural predicates--which exploit spurious
correlations to satisfy the symbolic constraints. In this paper, we address
reasoning shortcuts at their root cause and we introduce prototypical
neurosymbolic architectures. These models are able to satisfy the symbolic
constraints (be right) because they have learnt the correct basic concepts (for
the right reasons) and not because of spurious correlations, even in extremely
low data regimes. Leveraging the theory of prototypical learning, we
demonstrate that we can effectively avoid reasoning shortcuts by training the
models to satisfy the background knowledge while taking into account the
similarity of the input with respect to the handful of labelled datapoints. We
extensively validate our approach on the recently proposed rsbench benchmark
suite in a variety of settings and tasks with very scarce supervision: we show
significant improvements in learning the right concepts both in synthetic tasks
(MNIST-EvenOdd and Kand-Logic) and real-world, high-stake ones (BDD-OIA). Our
findings pave the way to prototype grounding as an effective,
annotation-efficient strategy for safe and reliable neurosymbolic learning.

Abstract: Foundation models for zero-shot time series forecasting face challenges in
efficient long-horizon prediction and reproducibility, with existing
synthetic-only approaches underperforming on challenging benchmarks. This paper
presents TempoPFN, a univariate time series foundation model based on linear
Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) pre-trained exclusively on synthetic data. The
model uses a GatedDeltaProduct architecture with state-weaving for fully

windowing or summarization techniques while maintaining robust temporal
state-tracking. Our comprehensive synthetic data pipeline unifies diverse
generators, including stochastic differential equations, Gaussian processes,
and audio synthesis, with novel augmentations. In zero-shot evaluations on the
Gift-Eval benchmark, TempoPFN achieves top-tier competitive performance,
outperforming all existing synthetic-only approaches and surpassing the vast

existing baselines by leveraging fully parallelizable training and inference.
We open-source our complete data generation pipeline and training code,

Abstract: Burnout is a psychological syndrome marked by emotional exhaustion,
depersonalization, and reduced personal accomplishment, with a significant
impact on individual well-being and organizational performance. This study
proposes a machine learning approach to predict burnout risk using the
HackerEarth Employee Burnout Challenge dataset. Three supervised algorithms
were evaluated: nearest neighbors (KNN), random forest, and support vector
machine (SVM), with model performance evaluated through 30-fold
cross-validation using the determination coefficient (R2). Among the models
tested, SVM achieved the highest predictive performance (R2 = 0.84) and was
statistically superior to KNN and Random Forest based on paired $t$-tests. To
ensure practical applicability, an interactive interface was developed using
Streamlit, allowing non-technical users to input data and receive burnout risk
predictions. The results highlight the potential of machine learning to support
early detection of burnout and promote data-driven mental health strategies in
organizational settings.

Conclusion: 提出的模型内在概念解释方法提供了更忠实、更一致的概念理解，同时保持模型性能，为深度网络的概念级理解提供了新途径。

Abstract: Deep networks have shown remarkable performance across a wide range of tasks,
yet getting a global concept-level understanding of how they function remains a
key challenge. Many post-hoc concept-based approaches have been introduced to
understand their workings, yet they are not always faithful to the model.
Further, they make restrictive assumptions on the concepts a model learns, such
as class-specificity, small spatial extent, or alignment to human expectations.
In this work, we put emphasis on the faithfulness of such concept-based
explanations and propose a new model with model-inherent mechanistic
concept-explanations. Our concepts are shared across classes and, from any
layer, their contribution to the logit and their input-visualization can be
faithfully traced. We also leverage foundation models to propose a new
concept-consistency metric, C$^2$-Score, that can be used to evaluate
concept-based methods. We show that, compared to prior work, our concepts are
quantitatively more consistent and users find our concepts to be more
interpretable, all while retaining competitive ImageNet performance.

Motivation: 现有基于注意力机制的Transformer模型在图结构学习方面主要局限于树状图，难以处理具有多个父节点的通用DAG结构。需要设计能够分离学习不同父节点关系的训练目标。

Method: 引入基于f-散度的核引导互信息(KG-MI)度量，结合多头注意力框架，每个注意力头关联不同的边际转移核来建模多样化的父子依赖关系。

Result: 理论证明对于K-父DAG生成的数据，通过梯度上升训练单层多头Transformer能在多项式时间内收敛到全局最优解，且当f-散度为KL散度时，学习到的注意力分数能准确反映真实邻接矩阵。

Conclusion: 该方法能够从理论上保证恢复底层图结构，实验验证了理论结果的有效性，为理解Transformer在图结构学习中的训练动态提供了理论保证。

Abstract: Uncovering hidden graph structures underlying real-world data is a critical
challenge with broad applications across scientific domains. Recently,
transformer-based models leveraging the attention mechanism have demonstrated
strong empirical success in capturing complex dependencies within graphs.
However, the theoretical understanding of their training dynamics has been
limited to tree-like graphs, where each node depends on a single parent.
Extending provable guarantees to more general directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) --
which involve multiple parents per node -- remains challenging, primarily due
to the difficulty in designing training objectives that enable different
attention heads to separately learn multiple different parent relationships.
  In this work, we address this problem by introducing a novel
information-theoretic metric: the kernel-guided mutual information (KG-MI),
based on the $f$-divergence. Our objective combines KG-MI with a multi-head
attention framework, where each head is associated with a distinct marginal
transition kernel to model diverse parent-child dependencies effectively. We
prove that, given sequences generated by a $K$-parent DAG, training a
single-layer, multi-head transformer via gradient ascent converges to the
global optimum in polynomial time. Furthermore, we characterize the attention
score patterns at convergence. In addition, when particularizing the
$f$-divergence to the KL divergence, the learned attention scores accurately
reflect the ground-truth adjacency matrix, thereby provably recovering the
underlying graph structure. Experimental results validate our theoretical
findings.

Conclusion: 这是第一个基于量子操作并在广泛序列学习任务中实现与强经典基线竞争性能的模型（RNN或其他），统一了酉循环作为高容量记忆、通过中间测量的部分观测以及非线性经典控制。

Abstract: We present a hybrid quantum-classical recurrent neural network (QRNN)
architecture in which the entire recurrent core is realized as a parametrized
quantum circuit (PQC) controlled by a classical feedforward network. The hidden
state is the quantum state of an $n$-qubit PQC, residing in an exponentially
large Hilbert space $\mathbb{C}^{2^n}$. The PQC is unitary by construction,
making the hidden-state evolution norm-preserving without external constraints.
At each timestep, mid-circuit readouts are combined with the input embedding
and processed by the feedforward network, which provides explicit classical
nonlinearity. The outputs parametrize the PQC, which updates the hidden state
via unitary dynamics. The QRNN is compact and physically consistent, and it
unifies (i) unitary recurrence as a high-capacity memory, (ii) partial
observation via mid-circuit measurements, and (iii) nonlinear classical control
for input-conditioned parametrization. We evaluate the model in simulation with
up to 14 qubits on sentiment analysis, MNIST, permuted MNIST, copying memory,
and language modeling, adopting projective measurements as a limiting case to
obtain mid-circuit readouts while maintaining a coherent recurrent quantum
memory. We further devise a soft attention mechanism over the mid-circuit
readouts in a sequence-to-sequence model and show its effectiveness for machine
translation. To our knowledge, this is the first model (RNN or otherwise)
grounded in quantum operations to achieve competitive performance against
strong classical baselines across a broad class of sequence-learning tasks.

Abstract: The accurate prediction of oceanographic variables is crucial for
understanding climate change, managing marine resources, and optimizing
maritime activities. Traditional ocean forecasting relies on numerical models;
however, these approaches face limitations in terms of computational cost and
scalability. In this study, we adapt Aurora, a foundational deep learning model
originally designed for atmospheric forecasting, to predict sea surface
temperature (SST) in the Canary Upwelling System. By fine-tuning this model
with high-resolution oceanographic reanalysis data, we demonstrate its ability
to capture complex spatiotemporal patterns while reducing computational
demands. Our methodology involves a staged fine-tuning process, incorporating
latitude-weighted error metrics and optimizing hyperparameters for efficient
learning. The experimental results show that the model achieves a low RMSE of
0.119K, maintaining high anomaly correlation coefficients (ACC $\approx
0.997$). The model successfully reproduces large-scale SST structures but faces
challenges in capturing finer details in coastal regions. This work contributes
to the field of data-driven ocean forecasting by demonstrating the feasibility
of using deep learning models pre-trained in different domains for oceanic
applications. Future improvements include integrating additional oceanographic
variables, increasing spatial resolution, and exploring physics-informed neural
networks to enhance interpretability and understanding. These advancements can
improve climate modeling and ocean prediction accuracy, supporting

Motivation: 传统PAC-Bayes框架只能为随机采样假设提供期望风险保证，需要随机预测，无法在实际部署单个确定性假设时使用。

Method: 提出了一个统一框架，包括通用oracle边界、数值边界和多数投票特化方法，从随机PAC-Bayesian保证中提取单个假设的保证。

Result: 经验表明，该方法在确定性分类器的泛化边界方面始终优于流行基线（最多可提高2倍）。

Conclusion: 该框架成功地将随机PAC-Bayesian保证转化为适用于单个确定性假设的泛化保证，解决了实际部署中的关键限制。

Abstract: PAC-Bayes is a popular and efficient framework for obtaining generalization
guarantees in situations involving uncountable hypothesis spaces.
Unfortunately, in its classical formulation, it only provides guarantees on the
expected risk of a randomly sampled hypothesis. This requires stochastic
predictions at test time, making PAC-Bayes unusable in many practical
situations where a single deterministic hypothesis must be deployed. We propose
a unified framework to extract guarantees holding for a single hypothesis from
stochastic PAC-Bayesian guarantees. We present a general oracle bound and
derive from it a numerical bound and a specialization to majority vote. We
empirically show that our approach consistently outperforms popular baselines
(by up to a factor of 2) when it comes to generalization bounds on
deterministic classifiers.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于Orlicz几何结构的广义Sobolev IPM方法，通过Musielak正则化将复杂优化问题简化为单变量优化，显著提升了计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Sobolev IPM受限于L^p几何结构，无法融入其他几何先验知识，限制了其应用范围。

Method: 通过Orlicz几何结构推广Sobolev IPM，建立Orlicz-Sobolev范数与Musielak范数的理论联系，并利用图结构将优化问题简化为单变量优化。

Result: GSI-M方法比流行的Orlicz-Wasserstein计算快数个数量级，在文档分类和拓扑数据分析任务中表现出优越性能。

Conclusion: 所提出的GSI-M框架不仅扩展了Sobolev IPM的应用范围，还解决了计算效率问题，为概率度量比较提供了高效实用的工具。

Abstract: We study the Sobolev IPM problem for measures supported on a graph metric
space, where critic function is constrained to lie within the unit ball defined
by Sobolev norm. While Le et al. (2025) achieved scalable computation by
relating Sobolev norm to weighted $L^p$-norm, the resulting framework remains
intrinsically bound to $L^p$ geometric structure, limiting its ability to
incorporate alternative structural priors beyond the $L^p$ geometry paradigm.
To overcome this limitation, we propose to generalize Sobolev IPM through the
lens of \emph{Orlicz geometric structure}, which employs convex functions to
capture nuanced geometric relationships, building upon recent advances in
optimal transport theory -- particularly Orlicz-Wasserstein (OW) and
generalized Sobolev transport -- that have proven instrumental in advancing
machine learning methodologies. This generalization encompasses classical
Sobolev IPM as a special case while accommodating diverse geometric priors
beyond traditional $L^p$ structure. It however brings up significant
computational hurdles that compound those already inherent in Sobolev IPM. To
address these challenges, we establish a novel theoretical connection between
Orlicz-Sobolev norm and Musielak norm which facilitates a novel regularization
for the generalized Sobolev IPM (GSI). By further exploiting the underlying
graph structure, we show that GSI with Musielak regularization (GSI-M) reduces
to a simple \emph{univariate optimization} problem, achieving remarkably
computational efficiency. Empirically, GSI-M is several-order faster than the
popular OW in computation, and demonstrates its practical advantages in
comparing probability measures on a given graph for document classification and
several tasks in topological data analysis.

Conclusion: 低秩流形上的局部学习是完整梯度训练的一个有原则且可扩展的替代方案。

Abstract: Training deep neural networks (DNNs) with backpropagation (BP) achieves
state-of-the-art accuracy but requires global error propagation and full
parameterization, leading to substantial memory and computational overhead.
Direct Feedback Alignment (DFA) enables local, parallelizable updates with
lower memory requirements but is limited by unstructured feedback and poor
scalability in deeper architectures, specially convolutional neural networks.
To address these limitations, we propose a structured local learning framework
that operates directly on low-rank manifolds defined by the Singular Value
Decomposition (SVD) of weight matrices. Each layer is trained in its decomposed
form, with updates applied to the SVD components using a composite loss that
integrates cross-entropy, subspace alignment, and orthogonality regularization.
Feedback matrices are constructed to match the SVD structure, ensuring
consistent alignment between forward and feedback pathways. Our method reduces
the number of trainable parameters relative to the original DFA model, without
relying on pruning or post hoc compression. Experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100,
and ImageNet show that our method achieves accuracy comparable to that of BP.
Ablation studies confirm the importance of each loss term in the low-rank
setting. These results establish local learning on low-rank manifolds as a
principled and scalable alternative to full-rank gradient-based training.

Conclusion: 该框架统一了多种已知度量，提供了设计任务特定度量的具体指导原则，核的选择决定了度量的行为特性

Abstract: Regression tasks, notably in safety-critical domains, require proper
uncertainty quantification, yet the literature remains largely
classification-focused. In this light, we introduce a family of measures for
total, aleatoric, and epistemic uncertainty based on proper scoring rules, with
a particular emphasis on kernel scores. The framework unifies several
well-known measures and provides a principled recipe for designing new ones
whose behavior, such as tail sensitivity, robustness, and out-of-distribution
responsiveness, is governed by the choice of kernel. We prove explicit
correspondences between kernel-score characteristics and downstream behavior,
yielding concrete design guidelines for task-specific measures. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that these measures are effective in downstream tasks
and reveal clear trade-offs among instantiations, including robustness and
out-of-distribution detection performance.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文系统比较了FP和INT量化格式在不同粒度下的性能，发现在8位细粒度量化中MXINT8优于FP格式，而在4位量化中FP格式通常更准确，但通过异常值缓解技术NVINT4可以超越NVFP4。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代AI硬件越来越多采用低精度FP格式处理LLM中的激活异常值，但缺乏FP和INT量化在不同粒度下的统一比较，导致算法和硬件协同设计缺乏明确指导。

Method: 系统研究FP和INT格式之间的权衡，引入对称裁剪方法解决细粒度低比特INT训练中的梯度偏差问题，应用Hadamard旋转等异常值缓解技术。

Result: 发现性能关键交叉点：FP在粗粒度量化中表现优异，但在细粒度级别比较更为微妙；MXINT8在8位细粒度格式中在算法精度和硬件效率上都优于FP对应格式；4位格式中FP通常具有精度优势，但应用异常值缓解技术后NVINT4可以超越NVFP4。

Conclusion: 挑战了当前硬件发展轨迹，证明一刀切的FP方法不是最优的，主张细粒度INT格式特别是MXINT8为未来AI加速器提供了更好的精度、功耗和效率平衡。

Abstract: Modern AI hardware, such as Nvidia's Blackwell architecture, is increasingly
embracing low-precision floating-point (FP) formats to handle the pervasive
activation outliers in Large Language Models (LLMs). Despite this industry
trend, a unified comparison of FP and integer (INT) quantization across varying
granularities has been missing, leaving algorithm and hardware co-design
without clear guidance. This paper fills that gap by systematically
investigating the trade-offs between FP and INT formats. We reveal a critical
performance crossover: while FP excels in coarse-grained quantization, the
comparison at fine-grained (block-wise) levels is more nuanced. Our
comprehensive comparison demonstrates that for popular 8-bit fine-grained
formats (e.g., MX with block size 32), MXINT8 is superior to its FP counterpart
in both algorithmic accuracy and hardware efficiency. However, for 4-bit
formats, FP (e.g., MXFP4, NVFP4) often holds an accuracy advantage , though we
show that NVINT4 can surpass NVFP4 when outlier-mitigation techniques like
Hadamard rotation are applied. We also introduce a symmetric clipping method
that resolves gradient bias in fine-grained low-bit INT training, enabling
nearly lossless performance for MXINT8 training. These findings challenge the
current hardware trajectory, demonstrating that a one-size-fits-all FP approach
is suboptimal and advocating that fine-grained INT formats, particularly
MXINT8, offer a better balance of accuracy, power, and efficiency for future AI
accelerators.

TL;DR: BOLT-GAN是基于贝叶斯最优学习阈值(BOLT)改进的WGAN框架，通过使用Lipschitz连续判别器，隐式最小化不同于Wasserstein距离的度量距离，提升了训练稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: WGAN框架在训练稳定性方面仍有改进空间，BOLT原理可能提供更好的训练方法。

Method: 在WGAN框架基础上引入BOLT原理，使用Lipschitz连续判别器，隐式最小化新的度量距离。

Result: 在四个标准图像生成基准测试中，BOLT-GAN始终优于WGAN，FID分数降低10-60%。

Conclusion: BOLT是一个广泛适用的原则，可以增强GAN训练效果。

Abstract: We introduce BOLT-GAN, a simple yet effective modification of the WGAN
framework inspired by the Bayes Optimal Learning Threshold (BOLT). We show that
with a Lipschitz continuous discriminator, BOLT-GAN implicitly minimizes a
different metric distance than the Earth Mover (Wasserstein) distance and
achieves better training stability. Empirical evaluations on four standard
image generation benchmarks (CIFAR-10, CelebA-64, LSUN Bedroom-64, and LSUN
Church-64) show that BOLT-GAN consistently outperforms WGAN, achieving 10-60%
lower Frechet Inception Distance (FID). Our results suggest that BOLT is a
broadly applicable principle for enhancing GAN training.

Motivation: 研究VLA模型在动作微调过程中原始视觉语言表示和知识的保留程度，因为不清楚这些预训练VLMs在适应动作模态时其原始表示能被保留多少。

Method: 通过探测VLA的隐藏表示和分析注意力图来表征和测量表示退化效应，设计对比任务来隔离动作微调引起的VL能力变化，并评估多种视觉表示对齐策略。

Result: 发现简单的动作微调会导致视觉表示退化，提出的简单对齐方法能有效缓解退化并提高在分布外场景的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 阐明了动作微调与VL表示退化之间的权衡关系，并提供了恢复继承VL能力的实用方法。

Abstract: The growing success of Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models stems from the
promise that pretrained Vision-Language Models (VLMs) can endow agents with
transferable world knowledge and vision-language (VL) grounding, laying a
foundation for action models with broader generalization. Yet when these VLMs
are adapted to the action modality, it remains unclear to what extent their
original VL representations and knowledge are preserved. In this work, we
conduct a systematic study of representation retention during VLA fine-tuning,
showing that naive action fine-tuning leads to degradation of visual
representations. To characterize and measure these effects, we probe VLA's
hidden representations and analyze attention maps, further, we design a set of
targeted tasks and methods that contrast VLA models with their counterpart
VLMs, isolating changes in VL capabilities induced by action fine-tuning. We
further evaluate a range of strategies for aligning visual representations and
introduce a simple yet effective method that mitigates degradation and yields
improved generalization to out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios. Taken together,
our analysis clarifies the trade-off between action fine-tuning and the
degradation of VL representations and highlights practical approaches to
recover inherited VL capabilities. Code is publicly available:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决联邦学习中图结构数据分布在不同客户端的问题，特别是子图互联场景，现有方法存在隐私风险或计算复杂度高的问题。

Method: 利用拉普拉斯平滑在谱域中捕获全局结构信息，避免交换敏感节点嵌入，提供隐私保证。

Result: 在基准数据集上的广泛实验表明，FedLap相比现有技术实现了竞争性或更优的性能。

Conclusion: FedLap是第一个具有强隐私保证的子图联邦学习方案，在保护隐私的同时保持了良好的性能。

Abstract: We consider the problem of federated learning (FL) with graph-structured data
distributed across multiple clients. In particular, we address the prevalent
scenario of interconnected subgraphs, where interconnections between clients
significantly influence the learning process. Existing approaches suffer from
critical limitations, either requiring the exchange of sensitive node
embeddings, thereby posing privacy risks, or relying on
computationally-intensive steps, which hinders scalability. To tackle these
challenges, we propose FedLap, a novel framework that leverages global
structure information via Laplacian smoothing in the spectral domain to
effectively capture inter-node dependencies while ensuring privacy and
scalability. We provide a formal analysis of the privacy of FedLap,
demonstrating that it preserves privacy. Notably, FedLap is the first subgraph
FL scheme with strong privacy guarantees. Extensive experiments on benchmark
datasets demonstrate that FedLap achieves competitive or superior utility
compared to existing techniques.

*Elia Torre,Michele Viscione,Lucas Pompe,Benjamin F Grewe,Valerio Mante*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文展示了循环神经网络（RNNs）如何通过特定机制模拟隐马尔可夫模型（HMMs）的离散状态转换，揭示了RNNs在无输入时活动会坍缩到固定点，而在随机输入驱动下会沿闭合轨道产生噪声维持的动态，通过"踢神经元"实现状态转换。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 过去研究主要关注简单、确定性行为，而自然环境中观察到的丰富、自发且可能随机的行为机制尚不清楚。HMMs揭示了自然行为被分割为离散潜在状态，这与RNNs实现的连续状态空间看似矛盾。

Method: 首先训练RNNs复制HMM的发射统计特性，然后对训练好的网络进行逆向工程分析，揭示其实现的机制。通过分析完全连接、循环和线性链等多种HMM架构来验证解决方案的通用性。

Result: 训练后的RNNs在无输入时活动坍缩到单一固定点；在随机输入驱动下，轨迹沿闭合轨道表现出噪声维持的动态。网络发展出高度结构化的连接性，少量"踢神经元"负责启动区域间的转换。这种机制在训练过程中通过进入随机共振状态而出现。

Conclusion: RNNs可以通过模块化重用相同的动态模式来模拟复杂的离散潜在动态，这表明RNNs能够执行概率计算，并揭示了一种组合性原则。

Abstract: Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) provide a powerful approach in neuroscience
to infer latent dynamics in neural populations and to generate hypotheses about
the neural computations underlying behavior. However, past work has focused on
relatively simple, input-driven, and largely deterministic behaviors - little
is known about the mechanisms that would allow RNNs to generate the richer,
spontaneous, and potentially stochastic behaviors observed in natural settings.
Modeling with Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) has revealed a segmentation of
natural behaviors into discrete latent states with stochastic transitions
between them, a type of dynamics that may appear at odds with the continuous
state spaces implemented by RNNs. Here we first show that RNNs can replicate
HMM emission statistics and then reverse-engineer the trained networks to
uncover the mechanisms they implement. In the absence of inputs, the activity
of trained RNNs collapses towards a single fixed point. When driven by
stochastic input, trajectories instead exhibit noise-sustained dynamics along
closed orbits. Rotation along these orbits modulates the emission probabilities
and is governed by transitions between regions of slow, noise-driven dynamics
connected by fast, deterministic transitions. The trained RNNs develop highly
structured connectivity, with a small set of "kick neurons" initiating
transitions between these regions. This mechanism emerges during training as
the network shifts into a regime of stochastic resonance, enabling it to
perform probabilistic computations. Analyses across multiple HMM architectures
- fully connected, cyclic, and linear-chain - reveal that this solution
generalizes through the modular reuse of the same dynamical motif, suggesting a
compositional principle by which RNNs can emulate complex discrete latent
dynamics.

TL;DR: 提出了基于图神经网络的结构模拟器GNSS，用于动态结构问题的替代建模，在波传播主导的结构动力学模拟中表现出色


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图神经网络在计算流体动力学中已有应用，但在结构问题特别是动态案例中研究较少，需要填补这一空白

Method: 采用编码-处理-解码的GNN范式，具有三个关键特性：节点固定局部坐标系、符号感知回归损失、波长感知连接半径

Result: 在50kHz脉冲激励的梁案例中，GNSS能准确再现物理现象数百个时间步，并能泛化到未见载荷条件，相比有限元基线获得显著推理加速

Conclusion: 具有物理一致性更新规则的局部保持GNN是动态波主导结构模拟的竞争性替代方案

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have recently been explored as surrogate models
for numerical simulations. While their applications in computational fluid
dynamics have been investigated, little attention has been given to structural
problems, especially for dynamic cases. To address this gap, we introduce the
Graph Network-based Structural Simulator (GNSS), a GNN framework for surrogate
modeling of dynamic structural problems.
  GNSS follows the encode-process-decode paradigm typical of GNN-based machine
learning models, and its design makes it particularly suited for dynamic
simulations thanks to three key features: (i) expressing node kinematics in
node-fixed local frames, which avoids catastrophic cancellation in
finite-difference velocities; (ii) employing a sign-aware regression loss,
which reduces phase errors in long rollouts; and (iii) using a
wavelength-informed connectivity radius, which optimizes graph construction.
  We evaluate GNSS on a case study involving a beam excited by a 50kHz
Hanning-modulated pulse. The results show that GNSS accurately reproduces the
physics of the problem over hundreds of timesteps and generalizes to unseen
loading conditions, where existing GNNs fail to converge or deliver meaningful
predictions.
  Compared with explicit finite element baselines, GNSS achieves substantial
inference speedups while preserving spatial and temporal fidelity. These
findings demonstrate that locality-preserving GNNs with physics-consistent
update rules are a competitive alternative for dynamic, wave-dominated
structural simulations.

Motivation: 传统RNN在处理长序列时容易丢失局部细节，现有方法如SpikGRU无法捕捉事件型时空数据中的细粒度局部依赖关系。

Method: 开发CS-GRU单元，利用卷积操作保持局部结构，整合脉冲神经元的时间精度和GRU的高效门控机制。

Result: 在NTIDIGITS、SHD等时序数据集和MNIST、DVSGesture、CIFAR10DVS等时空基准上表现优异，平均比最先进GRU变体提升4.35%，在MNIST上达到99.31%准确率，效率比SpikGRU高69%。

Conclusion: CS-GRU是一个多功能架构，在时序和时空数据处理方面均表现出色，实现了高精度和高效率。

Abstract: Spike-based temporal messaging enables SNNs to efficiently process both
purely temporal and spatio-temporal time-series or event-driven data. Combining
SNNs with Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs), a variant of recurrent neural networks,
gives rise to a robust framework for sequential data processing; however,
traditional RNNs often lose local details when handling long sequences.
Previous approaches, such as SpikGRU, fail to capture fine-grained local
dependencies in event-based spatio-temporal data. In this paper, we introduce
the Convolutional Spiking GRU (CS-GRU) cell, which leverages convolutional
operations to preserve local structure and dependencies while integrating the
temporal precision of spiking neurons with the efficient gating mechanisms of
GRUs. This versatile architecture excels on both temporal datasets (NTIDIGITS,
SHD) and spatio-temporal benchmarks (MNIST, DVSGesture, CIFAR10DVS). Our
experiments show that CS-GRU outperforms state-of-the-art GRU variants by an
average of 4.35%, achieving over 90% accuracy on sequential tasks and up to
99.31% on MNIST. It is worth noting that our solution achieves 69% higher
efficiency compared to SpikGRU. The code is available at:

Motivation: 随着深度学习需求的增长，现有工具在可扩展性和集成性方面存在限制，需要开发一个轻量级、可扩展的预处理工具来适应不同类型和规模的数据集。

Method: 利用SparkDataFrames存储数据确保可扩展性，采用通用JSON输入文件格式描述对DataFrame的逐步更改，实现了输入输出、过滤、基础统计、特征工程和探索性数据分析等处理阶段。

Result: 在六个不同数据集上验证了关键阶段的功能，展示了MLPrE能够独立处理平面文件中的多个字段并重新组合，通过UniProt术语数据集、葡萄酒质量数据和磷酸化位点激酶数据证明了工具的有效性。

Conclusion: MLPrE提供了一个通用且可扩展的预处理和早期数据分析工具，填补了机器学习应用中对这类工具的关键需求，能够加速和简化大型工作流中的早期开发阶段。

Abstract: With the recent growth of Deep Learning for AI, there is a need for tools to
meet the demand of data flowing into those models. In some cases, source data
may exist in multiple formats, and therefore the source data must be
investigated and properly engineered for a Machine Learning model or graph
database. Overhead and lack of scalability with existing workflows limit
integration within a larger processing pipeline such as Apache Airflow, driving
the need for a robust, extensible, and lightweight tool to preprocess arbitrary
datasets that scales with data type and size. To address this, we present
Machine Learning Preprocessing and Exploratory Data Analysis, MLPrE, in which
SparkDataFrames were utilized to hold data during processing and ensure
scalability. A generalizable JSON input file format was utilized to describe
stepwise changes to that DataFrame. Stages were implemented for input and
output, filtering, basic statistics, feature engineering, and exploratory data
analysis. A total of 69 stages were implemented into MLPrE, of which we
highlight and demonstrate key stages using six diverse datasets. We further
highlight MLPrE's ability to independently process multiple fields in flat
files and recombine them, otherwise requiring an additional pipeline, using a
UniProt glossary term dataset. Building on this advantage, we demonstrated the
clustering stage with available wine quality data. Lastly, we demonstrate the
preparation of data for a graph database in the final stages of MLPrE using
phosphosite kinase data. Overall, our MLPrE tool offers a generalizable and
scalable tool for preprocessing and early data analysis, filling a critical
need for such a tool given the ever expanding use of machine learning. This
tool serves to accelerate and simplify early stage development in larger
workflows.

Motivation: 传统MIL方法在处理医学图像时忽略了相邻切片或补丁之间的上下文关系，而这些关系在实际应用中至关重要。

Method: 设计了一个合成分类任务，其中相邻实例的特征对准确预测至关重要，并比较了传统MIL方法和相关MIL方法与最优贝叶斯估计器的性能。

Result: 实证表明，即使是最新的相关MIL方法在从数万个实例从头开始训练时，仍然难以达到最优泛化性能。

Conclusion: 当前MIL方法在处理实例间上下文关系方面存在显著局限性，需要进一步改进以充分利用相邻实例的关联信息。

Abstract: Multiple instance learning (MIL) is often used in medical imaging to classify
high-resolution 2D images by processing patches or classify 3D volumes by
processing slices. However, conventional MIL approaches treat instances
separately, ignoring contextual relationships such as the appearance of nearby
patches or slices that can be essential in real applications. We design a
synthetic classification task where accounting for adjacent instance features
is crucial for accurate prediction. We demonstrate the limitations of
off-the-shelf MIL approaches by quantifying their performance compared to the
optimal Bayes estimator for this task, which is available in closed-form. We
empirically show that newer correlated MIL methods still struggle to generalize
as well as possible when trained from scratch on tens of thousands of
instances.

Motivation: 传统SDE建模方法需要昂贵的数值求解器在任意时间点之间采样，计算成本高。

Method: 使用带有架构约束的条件归一化流直接学习SDE转移规律，保持随机流的数学特性。

Result: 在合成SDE模拟和真实世界跟踪、视频数据上，NSFs在保持分布准确性的同时，大幅减少了任意时间点采样的计算量。

Conclusion: NSFs为SDE建模提供了一种高效替代方案，在保持精度的同时显著加速采样过程。

Abstract: Stochastic differential equations (SDEs) are well suited to modelling noisy
and irregularly sampled time series found in finance, physics, and machine
learning. Traditional approaches require costly numerical solvers to sample
between arbitrary time points. We introduce Neural Stochastic Flows (NSFs) and
their latent variants, which directly learn (latent) SDE transition laws using
conditional normalising flows with architectural constraints that preserve
properties inherited from stochastic flows. This enables one-shot sampling
between arbitrary states and yields up to two orders of magnitude speed-ups at
large time gaps. Experiments on synthetic SDE simulations and on real-world
tracking and video data show that NSFs maintain distributional accuracy
comparable to numerical approaches while dramatically reducing computation for
arbitrary time-point sampling.

Motivation: 现有RLVR数据调度方法依赖路径指标来排序查询，忽略了查询的推理树结构，这限制了数据效率和准确性。

Method: 引入推理分数(r-score)衡量查询学习难度，基于此提出推理树调度算法(Re-Schedule)，构建从结构简单到复杂的课程。

Result: 在六个数学推理基准上的实验表明，Re-Schedule显著提升平均准确率，最高增益达3.2%。

Conclusion: 对推理树的结构理解为RLVR数据调度提供了更强大和原则性的基础。

Abstract: Using Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) to optimize Large
Language Models (LLMs) can be conceptualized as progressively editing a query's
`Reasoning Tree'. This process involves exploring nodes (tokens) and
dynamically modifying the model's policy at each node. When combined with data
scheduling, this process yields further gains in data efficiency and accuracy.
However, existing RLVR data scheduling methods typically rely on path-based
metrics to rank queries, overlooking the reasoning tree structures of these
queries. In this paper, we introduce a novel metric, namely Reasoning Score
(r-score), which measures the query's learning difficulty based on the
structure of its reasoning tree. Based on the r-score, we propose the Reasoning
Tree Schedule (Re-Schedule), a scheduling algorithm that constructs a
curriculum progressing from structurally simple (high r-score) to complex (low
r-score) queries. Experiments on six math-reasoning benchmarks show that
Re-Schedule significantly improves average accuracy, achieving gains of up to
3.2%. These strong results validate our approach and demonstrate that a
structural understanding of the reasoning tree provides a more powerful and
principled foundation for RLVR data scheduling.

Method: 研究循环结构因果模型中的反事实推理，特别关注移位-缩放干预（软性、策略式变化，对变量机制进行重新缩放和/或移位）

Abstract: Most counterfactual inference frameworks traditionally assume acyclic

many real-world systems (e.g. biological systems) contain feedback loops or
cyclic dependencies that violate acyclicity. In this work, we study

Conclusion: ProFees框架有效解决了E/M编码自动化中的现实世界复杂性，证明了其在该任务中的有效性。

Abstract: Evaluation and Management (E/M) coding, under the Current Procedural
Terminology (CPT) taxonomy, documents medical services provided to patients by
physicians. Used primarily for billing purposes, it is in physicians' best
interest to provide accurate CPT E/M codes. %While important, it is an
auxiliary task that adds to physicians' documentation burden. Automating this
coding task will help alleviate physicians' documentation burden, improve
billing efficiency, and ultimately enable better patient care. However, a
number of real-world complexities have made E/M encoding automation a
challenging task. In this paper, we elaborate some of the key complexities and
present ProFees, our LLM-based framework that tackles them, followed by a
systematic evaluation. On an expert-curated real-world dataset, ProFees
achieves an increase in coding accuracy of more than 36\% over a commercial CPT
E/M coding system and almost 5\% over our strongest single-prompt baseline,
demonstrating its effectiveness in addressing the real-world complexities.

Motivation: LLM虽然支持动态游戏交互，但无法遵循规则治理的交易系统基本流程（浏览-报价-审核-确认），损害玩家信任。

Conclusion: ASTP为商业游戏建立了实用基础，既满足实时要求又符合资源限制。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) enable dynamic game interactions but fail to
follow essential procedural flows in rule-governed trading systems, eroding
player trust. This work resolves the core tension between the creative
flexibility of LLMs and the procedural demands of in-game trading
(browse-offer-review-confirm). To this end, Autoregressive State-Tracking
Prompting (ASTP) is introduced, a methodology centered on a strategically
orchestrated prompt that compels an LLM to make its state-tracking process
explicit and verifiable. Instead of relying on implicit contextual
understanding, ASTP tasks the LLM with identifying and reporting a predefined
state label from the previous turn. To ensure transactional integrity, this is
complemented by a state-specific placeholder post-processing method for
accurate price calculations. Evaluation across 300 trading dialogues
demonstrates >99% state compliance and 99.3% calculation precision. Notably,
ASTP with placeholder post-processing on smaller models (Gemini-2.5-Flash)
matches larger models' (Gemini-2.5-Pro) performance while reducing response
time from 21.2s to 2.4s, establishing a practical foundation that satisfies
both real-time requirements and resource constraints of commercial games.

*Taekhyun Park,Yongjae Lee,Hyerim Bae*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出PM4GRPO方法，通过过程挖掘技术增强推理感知的组相对策略优化，在标准答案/格式奖励基础上增加推理过程信号，显著提升推理模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于强化学习的后训练方法通常只关注结果奖励，缺乏对推理过程的监督，限制了大型推理模型的多步推理能力发展。

Method: 使用过程挖掘技术计算一致性奖励，衡量策略模型的推理过程与预训练教师模型的匹配程度，结合标准答案/格式奖励进行组相对策略优化。

Result: 在五个基准测试上的实证结果表明，PM4GRPO显著优于现有的GRPO后训练方法。

Conclusion: 利用过程挖掘实现推理感知的GRPO能有效增强策略模型的推理能力。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL)-based post-training has been crucial for enabling
multi-step reasoning in large reasoning models (LRMs), yet current reward
schemes are typically outcome-centric. We propose PM4GRPO, a reasoning-aware
Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) that augments standard answer/format
rewards with signals over the reasoning procedure. To this end, process mining
techniques are utilized to compute a scalar conformance reward that measures
how closely a policy model's reasoning aligns with the pretrained teacher
model. The empirical results on five benchmarks demonstrate that PM4GRPO
significantly outperforms existing methodologies for GRPO-based post-training.
These results highlight that leveraging process mining for reasoning-aware GRPO
effectively enhances the reasoning capabilities of policy models.

Abstract: Stock movement prediction remains fundamentally challenging due to complex
temporal dependencies, heterogeneous modalities, and dynamically evolving
inter-stock relationships. Existing approaches often fail to unify structural,
semantic, and regime-adaptive modeling within a scalable framework. This work
introduces H3M-SSMoEs, a novel Hypergraph-based MultiModal architecture with
LLM reasoning and Style-Structured Mixture of Experts, integrating three key
innovations: (1) a Multi-Context Multimodal Hypergraph that hierarchically
captures fine-grained spatiotemporal dynamics via a Local Context Hypergraph
(LCH) and persistent inter-stock dependencies through a Global Context
Hypergraph (GCH), employing shared cross-modal hyperedges and Jensen-Shannon
Divergence weighting mechanism for adaptive relational learning and cross-modal
alignment; (2) a LLM-enhanced reasoning module, which leverages a frozen large
language model with lightweight adapters to semantically fuse and align
quantitative and textual modalities, enriching representations with
domain-specific financial knowledge; and (3) a Style-Structured Mixture of
Experts (SSMoEs) that combines shared market experts and industry-specialized
experts, each parameterized by learnable style vectors enabling regime-aware
specialization under sparse activation. Extensive experiments on three major
stock markets demonstrate that H3M-SSMoEs surpasses state-of-the-art methods in
both superior predictive accuracy and investment performance, while exhibiting
effective risk control. Datasets, source code, and model weights are available

TL;DR: KnowCoder-A1是一个通过多阶段课程强化学习训练的LLM，能够在知识库上进行自主推理问答，仅使用结果监督就能显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的KBQA方法通过过程监督微调LLMs，但这种方法对探索的激励较弱，无法有效增强代理推理能力。

Method: 采用多阶段课程强化学习，首先在高质量轨迹上微调LLM建立基础能力，然后通过从易到难的奖励调度应用课程RL来缓解结果监督中的奖励稀疏问题。

Result: 在三个主流数据集上持续优于先前方法，在GrailQA的零样本子集上实现了11.1%的相对提升，且仅使用十二分之一的训练数据。

Conclusion: 仅使用结果监督训练的KnowCoder-A1展现出强大的推理行为，证明了其在知识库问答中的有效代理推理能力。

Abstract: Knowledge Base Question Answering (KBQA) aims to answer natural-language
questions over a structured Knowledge Base (KB). Recent work improves KBQA by
adopting an agentic reasoning paradigm, in which Large Language Models (LLMs)
iteratively decompose a question, generate its corresponding logical queries,
and interact with the KB to derive the answer. However, these methods typically
fine-tune LLMs on reasoning trajectories synthesized via process supervision,
which offers weak incentives for exploration and thus fails to strengthen the
agentic reasoning ability. In this paper, we propose KnowCoder-A1, an LLM that
can autonomously perform agentic reasoning on KBs to obtain answers. To
incentivize autonomous exploration, KnowCoder-A1 trains the LLM under
outcome-only supervision via a multi-stage curriculum reinforcement learning
with an easy-to-hard curriculum. To establish foundational agentic
capabilities, KnowCoder-A1 first fine-tunes the LLM on a small set of
high-quality trajectories obtained through outcome-based rejection sampling.
Then, to alleviate the reward sparsity inherent in outcome-only supervision, it
applies multi-stage curriculum RL with reward schedules that progress from easy
to hard. Trained with outcome-only supervision, KnowCoder-A1 exhibits powerful
reasoning behaviors and consistently outperforms prior approaches across three
mainstream datasets. Notably, on the zero-shot subset of GrailQA, KnowCoder-A1
achieves up to an 11.1% relative improvement while using only one-twelfth of
the training data, demonstrating strong agentic reasoning capabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有安全对齐方法通常作为静态层应用于输入或输出，仅提供二元分类（安全或不安全），缺乏动态性和可解释性。

Method: 引入Agentic Moderation框架，包含Shield、Responder、Evaluator和Reflector四个协作智能体，实现模型无关的动态审核。

Result: 在五个数据集和四个大型视觉语言模型上的实验表明，该方法将攻击成功率降低7-19%，保持稳定的不遵循率，并将拒绝率提高4-20%。

Conclusion: 通过利用智能体架构的灵活性和推理能力，Agentic Moderation提供了模块化、可扩展和细粒度的安全执行，展示了智能体系统作为自动化安全治理基础的潜力。

Abstract: Agentic methods have emerged as a powerful and autonomous paradigm that
enhances reasoning, collaboration, and adaptive control, enabling systems to
coordinate and independently solve complex tasks. We extend this paradigm to
safety alignment by introducing Agentic Moderation, a model-agnostic framework
that leverages specialised agents to defend multimodal systems against
jailbreak attacks. Unlike prior approaches that apply as a static layer over
inputs or outputs and provide only binary classifications (safe or unsafe), our
method integrates dynamic, cooperative agents, including Shield, Responder,
Evaluator, and Reflector, to achieve context-aware and interpretable
moderation. Extensive experiments across five datasets and four representative
Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) demonstrate that our approach reduces the
Attack Success Rate (ASR) by 7-19%, maintains a stable Non-Following Rate (NF),
and improves the Refusal Rate (RR) by 4-20%, achieving robust, interpretable,
and well-balanced safety performance. By harnessing the flexibility and
reasoning capacity of agentic architectures, Agentic Moderation provides
modular, scalable, and fine-grained safety enforcement, highlighting the
broader potential of agentic systems as a foundation for automated safety
governance.

Conclusion: EneAD框架有效解决了自动驾驶能耗问题，在保持感知精度的同时显著降低计算消耗，提升了电动汽车的实用性和续航能力。

Abstract: Autonomous driving is an emerging technology that is expected to bring
significant social, economic, and environmental benefits. However, these
benefits come with rising energy consumption by computation engines, limiting
the driving range of vehicles, especially electric ones. Perception computing
is typically the most power-intensive component, as it relies on largescale
deep learning models to extract environmental features. Recently, numerous
studies have employed model compression techniques, such as sparsification,
quantization, and distillation, to reduce computational consumption. However,
these methods often result in either a substantial model size or a significant
drop in perception accuracy compared to high-computation models. To address
these challenges, we propose an energy-efficient autonomous driving framework,
called EneAD. In the adaptive perception module, a perception optimization
strategy is designed from the perspective of data management and tuning.
Firstly, we manage multiple perception models with different computational
consumption and adjust the execution framerate dynamically. Then, we define
them as knobs and design a transferable tuning method based on Bayesian
optimization to identify promising knob values that achieve low computation
while maintaining desired accuracy. To adaptively switch the knob values in
various traffic scenarios, a lightweight classification model is proposed to
distinguish the perception difficulty in different scenarios. In the robust
decision module, we propose a decision model based on reinforcement learning
and design a regularization term to enhance driving stability in the face of
perturbed perception results. Extensive experiments evidence the superiority of
our framework in both energy consumption and driving performance. EneAD can
reduce perception consumption by 1.9x to 3.5x and thus improve driving range by
3.9% to 8.5%

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出RAVR框架，通过答案引导的变分推理来增强LLM的推理能力，解决了在LLM能力范围外任务中难以采样高质量推理路径的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于认知科学洞察："为什么这是答案"比"答案是什么"更容易回答，因为避免了开放式探索的认知负担，转而进行解释性重构。当LLM无法生成高质量推理路径时，可以利用答案来推导推理过程。

Method: 引入RAVR（参考答案引导的变分推理）框架，使用答案条件推理作为仅问题推理的变分替代。通过形式化证明，条件于答案可以提升采样推理路径的期望效用。

Result: 在通用和数学领域的实验中，RAVR相比强基线模型表现出一致的改进。分析显示RAVR减少了犹豫，加强了结论整合，并促进了问题特定的推理策略。

Conclusion: 答案引导的推理方法能够将难以处理的问题转化为可学习的问题，显著提升LLM在复杂推理任务中的表现。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) can refine the reasoning abilities of large
language models (LLMs), but critically depends on a key prerequisite: the LLM
can already generate high-utility reasoning paths with non-negligible
probability. For tasks beyond the LLM's current competence, such reasoning path
can be hard to sample, and learning risks reinforcing familiar but suboptimal
reasoning. We are motivated by the insight from cognitive science that Why is
this the answer is often an easier question than What is the answer, as it
avoids the heavy cognitive load of open-ended exploration, opting instead for
explanatory reconstruction-systematically retracing the reasoning that links a
question to its answer. We show that LLMs can similarly leverage answers to
derive high-quality reasoning paths. We formalize this phenomenon and prove
that conditioning on answer provably increases the expected utility of sampled
reasoning paths, thereby transforming intractable problems into learnable ones.
Building on this insight, we introduce RAVR (Reference-Answer-guided
Variational Reasoning), an end-to-end framework that uses answer-conditioned
reasoning as a variational surrogate for question-only reasoning. Experiments
in both general and math domains demonstrate consistent improvements over
strong baselines. We further analyze the reasoning behavior and find that RAVR
reduces hesitation, strengthens conclusion consolidation, and promotes
problem-specific strategies in reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业事件日志数据具有大规模、高维度、异构性和复杂结构等特点，使得特征工程极具挑战性。现有的自动特征工程方法存在可解释性差、操作僵化和对异构数据适应性差等问题。

Method: FELA采用多智能体进化系统，包括想法智能体、代码智能体和批评智能体，通过协作生成和验证特征。系统结合LLM的推理编码能力与洞察引导的自进化范式，使用强化学习和遗传算法原理进行智能体进化。

Result: 在真实工业数据集上的实验表明，FELA能够生成可解释的、领域相关的特征，显著提高模型性能，同时减少人工工作量。

Conclusion: 基于LLM的多智能体系统有潜力成为复杂现实环境中自动化、可解释和自适应特征工程的通用框架。

Abstract: Event log data, recording fine-grained user actions and system events,
represent one of the most valuable assets for modern digital services. However,
the complexity and heterogeneity of industrial event logs--characterized by
large scale, high dimensionality, diverse data types, and intricate temporal or
relational structures--make feature engineering extremely challenging. Existing
automatic feature engineering approaches, such as AutoML or genetic methods,
often suffer from limited explainability, rigid predefined operations, and poor
adaptability to complicated heterogeneous data. In this paper, we propose FELA
(Feature Engineering LLM Agents), a multi-agent evolutionary system that
autonomously extracts meaningful and high-performing features from complex
industrial event log data. FELA integrates the reasoning and coding
capabilities of large language models (LLMs) with an insight-guided
self-evolution paradigm. Specifically, FELA employs specialized agents--Idea
Agents, Code Agents, and Critic Agents--to collaboratively generate, validate,
and implement novel feature ideas. An Evaluation Agent summarizes feedback and
updates a hierarchical knowledge base and dual-memory system to enable
continual improvement. Moreover, FELA introduces an agentic evolution
algorithm, combining reinforcement learning and genetic algorithm principles to
balance exploration and exploitation across the idea space. Extensive
experiments on real industrial datasets demonstrate that FELA can generate
explainable, domain-relevant features that significantly improve model
performance while reducing manual effort. Our results highlight the potential
of LLM-based multi-agent systems as a general framework for automated,
interpretable, and adaptive feature engineering in complex real-world
environments.

Motivation: 精神疾病共病在临床上很常见但诊断复杂，需要解决多种共病障碍同时出现的挑战，但目前缺乏支持共病诊断的大规模对话数据集。

Method: 整合合成患者电子病历构建和多智能体诊断对话生成，创建502个合成EMR，将临床访谈协议转化为分层状态机和上下文树，支持130多个诊断状态。

Conclusion: PsyCoTalk数据集能够开发和评估在单次对话中执行多障碍精神疾病筛查的模型，为精神疾病共病研究提供了宝贵资源。

Abstract: Psychiatric comorbidity is clinically significant yet challenging due to the
complexity of multiple co-occurring disorders. To address this, we develop a
novel approach integrating synthetic patient electronic medical record (EMR)
construction and multi-agent diagnostic dialogue generation. We create 502
synthetic EMRs for common comorbid conditions using a pipeline that ensures
clinical relevance and diversity. Our multi-agent framework transfers the
clinical interview protocol into a hierarchical state machine and context tree,
supporting over 130 diagnostic states while maintaining clinical standards.
Through this rigorous process, we construct PsyCoTalk, the first large-scale
dialogue dataset supporting comorbidity, containing 3,000 multi-turn diagnostic
dialogues validated by psychiatrists. This dataset enhances diagnostic accuracy
and treatment planning, offering a valuable resource for psychiatric
comorbidity research. Compared to real-world clinical transcripts, PsyCoTalk
exhibits high structural and linguistic fidelity in terms of dialogue length,
token distribution, and diagnostic reasoning strategies. Licensed psychiatrists
confirm the realism and diagnostic validity of the dialogues. This dataset
enables the development and evaluation of models capable of multi-disorder
psychiatric screening in a single conversational pass.

TL;DR: GAP框架通过图基规划建模任务依赖关系，实现自适应并行和串行工具执行，显著提升多步推理任务的效率和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM的自主代理（如ReAct）采用顺序推理和执行，无法利用独立子任务的并行性，导致工具利用效率低下和多步推理性能不佳。

Method: 训练代理基础模型将复杂任务分解为依赖感知的子任务图，自主确定哪些工具可以并行执行，哪些必须遵循顺序依赖。采用两阶段训练策略：监督微调后接基于正确性的强化学习。

Result: 在MHQA数据集上的实验表明，GAP显著优于传统ReAct基线，特别是在多步检索任务上，同时通过智能并行化大幅提升工具调用效率。

Conclusion: 图基代理规划框架通过依赖感知的任务编排，有效解决了顺序推理的瓶颈问题，为复杂任务求解提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Autonomous agents powered by large language models (LLMs) have shown
impressive capabilities in tool manipulation for complex task-solving. However,
existing paradigms such as ReAct rely on sequential reasoning and execution,
failing to exploit the inherent parallelism among independent sub-tasks. This
sequential bottleneck leads to inefficient tool utilization and suboptimal
performance in multi-step reasoning scenarios. We introduce Graph-based Agent
Planning (GAP), a novel framework that explicitly models inter-task
dependencies through graph-based planning to enable adaptive parallel and
serial tool execution. Our approach trains agent foundation models to decompose
complex tasks into dependency-aware sub-task graphs, autonomously determining
which tools can be executed in parallel and which must follow sequential
dependencies. This dependency-aware orchestration achieves substantial
improvements in both execution efficiency and task accuracy. To train GAP, we
construct a high-quality dataset of graph-based planning traces derived from
the Multi-Hop Question Answering (MHQA) benchmark. We employ a two-stage
training strategy: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on the curated dataset,
followed by reinforcement learning (RL) with a correctness-based reward
function on strategically sampled queries where tool-based reasoning provides
maximum value. Experimental results on MHQA datasets demonstrate that GAP
significantly outperforms traditional ReAct baselines, particularly on
multi-step retrieval tasks, while achieving dramatic improvements in tool
invocation efficiency through intelligent parallelization. The project page is

TL;DR: 本文提出了KVDA-UCT算法，通过分析即时奖励来推断价值差异，打破了传统价值等价状态分组的限制，显著提高了MCTS的样本效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统MCTS抽象算法（如OGA-UCT）要求状态-动作对具有相同的即时奖励，这一刚性条件限制了可发现的抽象数量，从而影响了样本效率。

Method: 提出KVDA框架，通过分析即时奖励推断价值差异，允许将价值不同的状态和状态-动作对分组，并基于此修改OGA-UCT得到KVDA-UCT算法。

Result: KVDA-UCT比OGA-UCT检测到显著更多的抽象，无需额外参数，在多种确定性环境和参数设置下表现优于OGA-UCT。

Conclusion: KVDA框架通过推断价值差异而非要求价值等价，有效提升了MCTS的抽象能力和样本效率，KVDA-UCT算法在多个测试环境中表现出色。

Abstract: A core challenge of Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) is its sample efficiency,
which can be improved by grouping state-action pairs and using their aggregate
statistics instead of single-node statistics. On the Go Abstractions in Upper
Confidence bounds applied to Trees (OGA-UCT) is the state-of-the-art MCTS
abstraction algorithm for deterministic environments that builds its
abstraction using the Abstractions of State-Action Pairs (ASAP) framework,
which aims to detect states and state-action pairs with the same value under
optimal play by analysing the search graph. ASAP, however, requires two
state-action pairs to have the same immediate reward, which is a rigid
condition that limits the number of abstractions that can be found and thereby
the sample efficiency. In this paper, we break with the paradigm of grouping
value-equivalent states or state-action pairs and instead group states and
state-action pairs with possibly different values as long as the difference
between their values can be inferred. We call this abstraction framework Known
Value Difference Abstractions (KVDA), which infers the value differences by
analysis of the immediate rewards and modifies OGA-UCT to use this framework
instead. The modification is called KVDA-UCT, which detects significantly more
abstractions than OGA-UCT, introduces no additional parameter, and outperforms
OGA-UCT on a variety of deterministic environments and parameter settings.

Conclusion: 智能体AI的未来不在于单一范式的统治，而在于两者的有意整合，以创建既适应性强又可靠的系统，为未来研究、开发和政策提供概念工具包。

Abstract: Agentic AI represents a transformative shift in artificial intelligence, but
its rapid advancement has led to a fragmented understanding, often conflating
modern neural systems with outdated symbolic models -- a practice known as
conceptual retrofitting. This survey cuts through this confusion by introducing
a novel dual-paradigm framework that categorizes agentic systems into two
distinct lineages: the Symbolic/Classical (relying on algorithmic planning and
persistent state) and the Neural/Generative (leveraging stochastic generation
and prompt-driven orchestration). Through a systematic PRISMA-based review of
90 studies (2018--2025), we provide a comprehensive analysis structured around
this framework across three dimensions: (1) the theoretical foundations and
architectural principles defining each paradigm; (2) domain-specific
implementations in healthcare, finance, and robotics, demonstrating how
application constraints dictate paradigm selection; and (3) paradigm-specific
ethical and governance challenges, revealing divergent risks and mitigation
strategies. Our analysis reveals that the choice of paradigm is strategic:
symbolic systems dominate safety-critical domains (e.g., healthcare), while
neural systems prevail in adaptive, data-rich environments (e.g., finance).
Furthermore, we identify critical research gaps, including a significant
deficit in governance models for symbolic systems and a pressing need for
hybrid neuro-symbolic architectures. The findings culminate in a strategic
roadmap arguing that the future of Agentic AI lies not in the dominance of one
paradigm, but in their intentional integration to create systems that are both
adaptable and reliable. This work provides the essential conceptual toolkit to
guide future research, development, and policy toward robust and trustworthy
hybrid intelligent systems.

Conclusion: 研究重点应从消除工具性目标转向理解、管理和引导它们朝向人类对齐的目标。

Abstract: In artificial intelligence (AI) alignment research, instrumental goals, also
called instrumental subgoals or instrumental convergent goals, are widely
associated with advanced AI systems. These goals, which include tendencies such
as power-seeking and self-preservation, become problematic when they conflict
with human aims. Conventional alignment theory treats instrumental goals as
sources of risk that become problematic through failure modes such as reward
hacking or goal misgeneralization, and attempts to limit the symptoms of
instrumental goals, notably resource acquisition and self-preservation. This
article proposes an alternative framing: that a philosophical argument can be
constructed according to which instrumental goals may be understood as features
to be accepted and managed rather than failures to be limited. Drawing on
Aristotle's ontology and its modern interpretations, an ontology of concrete,
goal-directed entities, it argues that advanced AI systems can be seen as
artifacts whose formal and material constitution gives rise to effects distinct
from their designers' intentions. In this view, the instrumental tendencies of
such systems correspond to per se outcomes of their constitution rather than
accidental malfunctions. The implication is that efforts should focus less on
eliminating instrumental goals and more on understanding, managing, and
directing them toward human-aligned ends.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了MTIR-SQL框架，通过多轮工具集成推理和动态执行反馈来改进Text-to-SQL任务，在BIRD和SPIDER数据集上取得显著性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要依赖静态执行反馈，限制了实时错误纠正能力。集成多轮工具调用和动态反馈可以显著提高模型的适应性和鲁棒性。

Method: 提出MTIR-SQL框架，采用执行感知的多轮推理范式，在每个推理步骤中无缝集成数据库执行反馈，扩展GRPO算法以处理复杂多轮交互场景，并添加轨迹过滤机制和移除KL损失约束。

Result: MTIR-SQL在BIRD Dev数据集上达到64.4%准确率，在SPIDER Dev数据集上达到84.6%执行准确率，显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 多轮工具集成推理结合动态执行反馈能够有效提升Text-to-SQL任务的性能，所提出的MTIR-SQL框架在多个基准测试中表现出色。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in Text-to-SQL tasks,
Reinforcement Learning (RL) has become a common method for improving
performance. Existing methods primarily rely on static execution feedback,
which restricts real-time error correction. However, integrating multi-turn
tool invocation along with dynamic feedback could significantly improve
adaptability and robustness, ultimately enhancing model performance. To address
these issues, we propose MTIR-SQL, an innovative Multi-turn Tool-Integrated
Reasoning reinforcement learning framework for Text-to-SQL. Our approach
introduces an execution-aware multi-turn reasoning paradigm that seamlessly
incorporates database execution feedback at each reasoning step, enabling
context-sensitive query generation and progressive refinement throughout the
reasoning process. The framework extends the GRPO algorithm to accommodate
complex multi-turn interaction scenarios. Considering the training instability
characteristics of MTIR and the potential for significant Deviation of model
distribution from the initial model, we enhance the GRPO algorithm by adding a
trajectory filtering mechanism and removing KL loss constraints. Experimental
results demonstrate that MTIR-SQL, with 4B parameters, achieves \textbf{64.4}\%
accuracy in the BIRD Dev and 84.6% execution accuracy in the SPIDER Dev,
significantly outperforming existing approaches.

TL;DR: 使用大型语言模型为逻辑规则中的谓词自动命名，解决谓词发明等方法产生的未命名谓词问题，提高逻辑理论的可读性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在归纳逻辑编程中，各种规则生成方法会产生包含未命名谓词的规则，这阻碍了逻辑理论的可读性、可解释性和可重用性。

Method: 利用LLMs处理自然语言和代码的能力，为未命名谓词提供语义上有意义的命名建议。

Result: 在手工制作的逻辑规则上评估表明，LLMs在此任务上具有潜力。

Conclusion: LLMs能够为逻辑规则中的未命名谓词提供语义上有意义的命名，有助于提高逻辑理论的可读性和可解释性。

Abstract: In this paper, we address the problem of giving names to predicates in logic
rules using Large Language Models (LLMs). In the context of Inductive Logic
Programming, various rule generation methods produce rules containing unnamed
predicates, with Predicate Invention being a key example. This hinders the
readability, interpretability, and reusability of the logic theory. Leveraging
recent advancements in LLMs development, we explore their ability to process
natural language and code to provide semantically meaningful suggestions for
giving a name to unnamed predicates. The evaluation of our approach on some
hand-crafted logic rules indicates that LLMs hold potential for this task.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种面向金融科技领域的智能RAG架构，通过模块化代理系统解决专业领域检索的挑战，在检索精度和相关性方面优于标准RAG基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RAG系统在金融科技等专业领域面临挑战，包括领域特定本体、密集术语和缩略语，影响检索和合成的有效性。

Method: 采用模块化代理架构，支持智能查询重构、基于关键词提取的迭代子查询分解、上下文缩略语解析和交叉编码器上下文重排序。

Result: 在85个问答参考三元组数据集上的实验表明，智能RAG系统在检索精度和相关性方面优于基线，但延迟有所增加。

Conclusion: 结构化多代理方法为复杂领域特定环境中的检索鲁棒性增强提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems often face limitations in
specialized domains such as fintech, where domain-specific ontologies, dense
terminology, and acronyms complicate effective retrieval and synthesis. This
paper introduces an agentic RAG architecture designed to address these
challenges through a modular pipeline of specialized agents. The proposed
system supports intelligent query reformulation, iterative sub-query
decomposition guided by keyphrase extraction, contextual acronym resolution,
and cross-encoder-based context re-ranking. We evaluate our approach against a
standard RAG baseline using a curated dataset of 85 question--answer--reference
triples derived from an enterprise fintech knowledge base. Experimental results
demonstrate that the agentic RAG system outperforms the baseline in retrieval
precision and relevance, albeit with increased latency. These findings suggest
that structured, multi-agent methodologies offer a promising direction for
enhancing retrieval robustness in complex, domain-specific settings.

TL;DR: 提出一种新颖的零强化学习范式，通过结合可验证奖励和生成式奖励模型，在可验证和不可验证领域进行多任务训练，提升大语言模型的推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前零强化学习研究主要关注易于验证奖励信号的领域，但在验证不直接的多样化场景中激发推理能力的研究仍不足。

Method: 设计结合可验证奖励和生成式奖励模型的多任务零强化学习训练，并引入平滑长度惩罚来鼓励生成更全面的思考标记。

Result: 在Qwen3-8B-Base和Qwen3-14B-Base上的实验结果表明，该方法在需要广泛推理的任务和更通用任务上都取得了优越的推理性能。

Conclusion: 提出的零强化学习范式能有效提升模型在可验证和不可验证领域的推理能力，并通过多任务训练促进推理能力在领域间的迁移。

Abstract: Zero Reinforcement Learning (Zero-RL) has proven to be an effective approach
for enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) by
directly applying reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards on pretrained
models, without the need for a supervised fine-tuning phase. However, current
research on zero-RL primarily focuses on domains with easily verifiable reward
signals, such as mathematics, programming, and other reasoning tasks. The
challenge of eliciting reasoning abilities in more diverse scenarios, where
verification is not straightforward, remains underexplored. To address this
gap, we propose a novel zero-RL paradigm designed to improve a model's
reasoning ability across both verifiable and non-verifiable domains. By
combining verifiable rewards with a generative reward model, we conduct
multi-task zero-RL training across both domains, facilitating the transfer of
reasoning capabilities between them. Furthermore, to mitigate reward hacking in
the generative reward model, we design a smooth length penalty that encourages
the generation of more comprehensive thinking tokens in general domains.
Experimental results on Qwen3-8B-Base and Qwen3-14B-Base demonstrate that our
approach achieves superior reasoning performance, not only on tasks requiring
extensive reasoning but also on more general tasks.

Method: MoGE包含两个组件：(1)基于扩散模型的关键状态生成器，通过效用函数评估状态对策略探索的潜在影响；(2)基于关键状态构建关键转换的一步想象世界模型。采用模块化设计，可与现有算法无缝集成。

Result: 在OpenAI Gym和DeepMind Control Suite上的实验结果表明，MoGE有效连接了探索和策略学习，在复杂控制任务中显著提高了样本效率和性能。

Conclusion: MoGE通过生成关键状态和动态一致经验，成功解决了被动探索的局限性，为强化学习探索提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Exploration is fundamental to reinforcement learning (RL), as it determines
how effectively an agent discovers and exploits the underlying structure of its
environment to achieve optimal performance. Existing exploration methods
generally fall into two categories: active exploration and passive exploration.
The former introduces stochasticity into the policy but struggles in
high-dimensional environments, while the latter adaptively prioritizes
transitions in the replay buffer to enhance exploration, yet remains
constrained by limited sample diversity. To address the limitation in passive
exploration, we propose Modelic Generative Exploration (MoGE), which augments
exploration through the generation of under-explored critical states and
synthesis of dynamics-consistent experiences through transition models. MoGE is
composed of two components: (1) a diffusion-based generator that synthesizes
critical states under the guidance of a utility function evaluating each
state's potential influence on policy exploration, and (2) a one-step
imagination world model for constructing critical transitions based on the
critical states for agent learning. Our method adopts a modular formulation
that aligns with the principles of off-policy learning, allowing seamless
integration with existing algorithms to improve exploration without altering
their core structures. Empirical results on OpenAI Gym and DeepMind Control
Suite reveal that MoGE effectively bridges exploration and policy learning,
leading to remarkable gains in both sample efficiency and performance across
complex control tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 精神障碍诊断主要依赖医患对话，这种主观过程导致诊断结果在不同医生和患者之间存在差异，难以获得可靠结果，需要标准化精神科诊断。

Method: 利用在精神科医患对话数据集上微调的LLMs，通过共识决策过程聚合各模型的诊断预测，并由OpenAI-gpt-oss推理LLM进行精炼，部署LLM代理协调整个诊断工作流程。

Result: 实验结果表明，结合微调LLMs和推理模型能够创建强大且高度准确的精神健康评估诊断系统，原型系统已与美国陆军医学研究团队合作开发。

Conclusion: 这是首个将微调LLM联盟与推理LLM集成用于临床精神健康诊断的应用，为下一代AI驱动的电子健康系统标准化精神科诊断铺平了道路。

Abstract: The diagnosis of most mental disorders, including psychiatric evaluations,
primarily depends on dialogues between psychiatrists and patients. This
subjective process can lead to variability in diagnoses across clinicians and
patients, resulting in inconsistencies and challenges in achieving reliable
outcomes. To address these issues and standardize psychiatric diagnoses, we
propose a Fine-Tuned Large Language Model (LLM) Consortium and OpenAI-gpt-oss
Reasoning LLM-enabled Decision Support System for the clinical diagnosis of
mental disorders. Our approach leverages fine-tuned LLMs trained on
conversational datasets involving psychiatrist-patient interactions focused on
mental health conditions (e.g., depression). The diagnostic predictions from
individual models are aggregated through a consensus-based decision-making
process, refined by the OpenAI-gpt-oss reasoning LLM. We propose a novel method
for deploying LLM agents that orchestrate communication between the LLM
consortium and the reasoning LLM, ensuring transparency, reliability, and
responsible AI across the entire diagnostic workflow. Experimental results
demonstrate the transformative potential of combining fine-tuned LLMs with a
reasoning model to create a robust and highly accurate diagnostic system for
mental health assessment. A prototype of the proposed platform, integrating
three fine-tuned LLMs with the OpenAI-gpt-oss reasoning LLM, was developed in
collaboration with the U.S. Army Medical Research Team in Norfolk, Virginia,
USA. To the best of our knowledge, this work represents the first application
of a fine-tuned LLM consortium integrated with a reasoning LLM for clinical
mental health diagnosis paving the way for next-generation AI-powered eHealth
systems aimed at standardizing psychiatric diagnoses.

TL;DR: 提出了CAIR方法，首个用于评估Agentic AI Workflow中各个智能体对最终输出影响力的方法，通过反事实分析实现任务无关的分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于AAW系统的高自主性和广泛应用，需要从质量和安全角度深入理解其运作机制，但目前缺乏评估单个智能体对系统最终输出影响的方法。

Method: 采用反事实分析技术，通过改变特定智能体的输出来观察对最终结果的影响程度，从而评估其影响力。

Result: 在包含30个用例和230个功能的AAW数据集上评估，CAIR产生一致的排名，优于基线方法，并能有效提升下游任务的效果和相关性。

Conclusion: CAIR是首个能够评估AAW中智能体影响力的方法，支持离线和推理时分析，为理解和优化多智能体系统提供了重要工具。

Abstract: An Agentic AI Workflow (AAW), also known as an LLM-based multi-agent system,
is an autonomous system that assembles several LLM-based agents to work
collaboratively towards a shared goal. The high autonomy, widespread adoption,
and growing interest in such AAWs highlight the need for a deeper understanding
of their operations, from both quality and security aspects. To this day, there
are no existing methods to assess the influence of each agent on the AAW's
final output. Adopting techniques from related fields is not feasible since
existing methods perform only static structural analysis, which is unsuitable
for inference time execution. We present Counterfactual-based Agent Influence
Ranker (CAIR) - the first method for assessing the influence level of each
agent on the AAW's output and determining which agents are the most
influential. By performing counterfactual analysis, CAIR provides a
task-agnostic analysis that can be used both offline and at inference time. We
evaluate CAIR using an AAWs dataset of our creation, containing 30 different
use cases with 230 different functionalities. Our evaluation showed that CAIR
produces consistent rankings, outperforms baseline methods, and can easily
enhance the effectiveness and relevancy of downstream tasks.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ALDEN是一个多轮强化学习框架，通过微调视觉语言模型作为交互式代理，主动导航长文档。它引入fetch动作直接访问页面，结合搜索动作，并采用跨级别奖励和视觉语义锚定机制来稳定训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖固定推理模板或刚性流程，使视觉语言模型处于被动角色，限制了效率和泛化能力。需要开发能够主动导航和分析跨页信息的系统。

Method: 多轮强化学习框架，引入fetch动作直接按索引访问页面，提出基于规则的跨级别奖励进行密集过程监督，使用视觉语义锚定机制稳定训练。

Result: 在三个开源数据集构建的语料库上训练后，ALDEN在五个长文档基准测试中实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: ALDEN标志着从被动文档阅读向能够自主导航和推理长视觉丰富文档的代理迈出了一步，为更准确和高效的长文档理解提供了稳健路径。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) excel at interpreting text-rich images but
struggle with long, visually complex documents that demand analysis and
integration of information spread across multiple pages. Existing approaches
typically rely on fixed reasoning templates or rigid pipelines, which force
VLMs into a passive role and hinder both efficiency and generalization. We
present Active Long-DocumEnt Navigation (ALDEN), a multi-turn reinforcement
learning framework that fine-tunes VLMs as interactive agents capable of
actively navigating long, visually rich documents. ALDEN introduces a novel
fetch action that directly accesses the page by index, complementing the
classic search action and better exploiting document structure. For dense
process supervision and efficient training, we propose a rule-based cross-level
reward that provides both turn- and token-level signals. To address the
empirically observed training instability caused by numerous visual tokens from
long documents, we further propose a visual-semantic anchoring mechanism that
applies a dual-path KL-divergence constraint to stabilize visual and textual
representations separately during training. Trained on a corpus constructed
from three open-source datasets, ALDEN achieves state-of-the-art performance on
five long-document benchmarks. Overall, ALDEN marks a step beyond passive
document reading toward agents that autonomously navigate and reason across
long, visually rich documents, offering a robust path to more accurate and
efficient long-document understanding.

Motivation: 随着无人机在城市区域用于配送和监控的数量不断增加，需要在复杂的城市湍流环境中开发有效的导航策略，传统导航算法在湍流和回流区域表现不佳。

Method: 采用流动感知的PPO算法结合GTrXL架构，为智能体提供更丰富的湍流场信息，并与无次级预测任务的PPO+GTrXL、PPO+LSTM以及传统Zermelo导航算法进行对比。

Result: 相比PPO+LSTM、PPO+GTrXL和传统Zermelo导航算法，该方法显著提高了成功率(SR)并降低了碰撞率(CR)。

Conclusion: 该方法为在复杂城市环境中重新构想无人机应用场景铺平了道路。

Abstract: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly populating urban areas for
delivery and surveillance purposes. In this work, we develop an optimal
navigation strategy based on Deep Reinforcement Learning. The environment is
represented by a three-dimensional high-fidelity simulation of an urban flow,
characterized by turbulence and recirculation zones. The algorithm presented
here is a flow-aware Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) combined with a Gated
Transformer eXtra Large (GTrXL) architecture, giving the agent richer
information about the turbulent flow field in which it navigates. The results
are compared with a PPO+GTrXL without the secondary prediction tasks, a PPO
combined with Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) cells and a traditional navigation
algorithm. The obtained results show a significant increase in the success rate
(SR) and a lower crash rate (CR) compared to a PPO+LSTM, PPO+GTrXL and the
classical Zermelo's navigation algorithm, paving the way to a completely
reimagined UAV landscape in complex urban environments.

TL;DR: BambooKG是一种带有基于频率权重的非三元组边的知识图谱，通过反映链接强度来减少信息损失，在单跳和多跳推理任务中表现优于现有解决方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 检索增强生成虽然能让LLMs访问外部知识，但独立处理检索块且在多跳或关系推理方面存在困难，尤其是在跨文档时。知识图谱通过三元组捕获实体关系，但会遗漏不符合三元组结构的信息。

Method: 引入BambooKG知识图谱，在非三元组边上使用基于频率的权重来反映链接强度，借鉴赫布原理"一起激发，一起连接"。

Result: 减少了信息损失，在单跳和多跳推理任务上表现改善。

Conclusion: BambooKG通过频率加权的非三元组边在知识图谱中更好地捕获关系信息，在多跳推理任务中优于现有方法。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation allows LLMs to access external knowledge,
reducing hallucinations and ageing-data issues. However, it treats retrieved
chunks independently and struggles with multi-hop or relational reasoning,
especially across documents. Knowledge graphs enhance this by capturing the
relationships between entities using triplets, enabling structured, multi-chunk
reasoning. However, these tend to miss information that fails to conform to the
triplet structure. We introduce BambooKG, a knowledge graph with
frequency-based weights on non-triplet edges which reflect link strength,
drawing on the Hebbian principle of "fire together, wire together". This
decreases information loss and results in improved performance on single- and
multi-hop reasoning, outperforming the existing solutions.

TL;DR: TheraMind是一个用于纵向心理咨询的战略性自适应代理，采用双循环架构解决现有方法缺乏情感理解、自适应策略和多会话治疗的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有心理咨询大语言模型缺乏情感理解、自适应策略和跨会话治疗能力，与真实临床实践差距较大。

Method: 提出双循环架构：会话内循环用于战术对话管理，感知患者情绪状态并动态选择响应策略；跨会话循环用于战略治疗规划，评估治疗效果并调整后续方法。

Result: 在高保真模拟环境中验证，TheraMind在多会话指标（连贯性、灵活性、治疗协调性）上优于其他方法。

Conclusion: 双循环设计能有效模拟战略性、自适应和纵向治疗行为，为心理咨询AI提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) in psychological counseling have attracted
increasing attention. However, existing approaches often lack emotional
understanding, adaptive strategies, and the use of therapeutic methods across
multiple sessions with long-term memory, leaving them far from real clinical
practice. To address these critical gaps, we introduce TheraMind, a strategic
and adaptive agent for longitudinal psychological counseling. The cornerstone
of TheraMind is a novel dual-loop architecture that decouples the complex
counseling process into an Intra-Session Loop for tactical dialogue management
and a Cross-Session Loop for strategic therapeutic planning. The Intra-Session
Loop perceives the patient's emotional state to dynamically select response
strategies while leveraging cross-session memory to ensure continuity.
Crucially, the Cross-Session Loop empowers the agent with long-term
adaptability by evaluating the efficacy of the applied therapy after each
session and adjusting the method for subsequent interactions. We validate our
approach in a high-fidelity simulation environment grounded in real clinical
cases. Extensive evaluations show that TheraMind outperforms other methods,
especially on multi-session metrics like Coherence, Flexibility, and
Therapeutic Attunement, validating the effectiveness of its dual-loop design in
emulating strategic, adaptive, and longitudinal therapeutic behavior. The code
is publicly available at https://0mwwm0.github.io/TheraMind/.

TL;DR: 提出Epistemic Suite诊断方法，通过20个诊断视角揭示AI输出的认知条件，产生可检查的FACS工具包，保持AI表现与理解的区分。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型生成流畅但可能误导的文本，用户容易将模拟连贯性误认为真正理解，需要揭示AI输出的认知生产条件。

Method: 基于三个设计原则：诊断生产先于评估主张、偏好诊断牵引而非基础性解决、嵌入反思性作为结构要求。包含Epistemic Triage协议和Meta-Governance层。

Result: 产生可检查的FACS工具包（标志、注释、矛盾地图、暂停日志），实现认知暂停机制，作为外部支架而非内部对齐。

Conclusion: 该方法保持AI表现与理解的区分，实现可问责的审议，同时保持认知谦逊，保留拒绝权作为保障而非失败。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) generate fluent, plausible text that can mislead
users into mistaking simulated coherence for genuine understanding. This paper
introduces the Epistemic Suite, a post-foundational diagnostic methodology for
surfacing the epistemic conditions under which AI outputs are produced and
received. Rather than determining truth or falsity, the Suite operates through
twenty diagnostic lenses, applied by practitioners as context warrants, to
reveal patterns such as confidence laundering, narrative compression, displaced
authority, and temporal drift. It is grounded in three design principles:
diagnosing production before evaluating claims, preferring diagnostic traction
over foundational settlement, and embedding reflexivity as a structural
requirement rather than an ethical ornament. When enacted, the Suite shifts
language models into a diagnostic stance, producing inspectable
artifacts-flags, annotations, contradiction maps, and suspension logs (the FACS
bundle)-that create an intermediary layer between AI output and human judgment.
A key innovation is epistemic suspension, a practitioner-enacted circuit
breaker that halts continuation when warrant is exceeded, with resumption based
on judgment rather than rule. The methodology also includes an Epistemic Triage
Protocol and a Meta-Governance Layer to manage proportionality and link
activation to relational accountability, consent, historical context, and
pluralism safeguards. Unlike internalist approaches that embed alignment into
model architectures (e.g., RLHF or epistemic-integrity proposals), the Suite
operates externally as scaffolding, preserving expendability and refusal as
safeguards rather than failures. It preserves the distinction between
performance and understanding, enabling accountable deliberation while
maintaining epistemic modesty.

Motivation: 探索大型语言模型能否从非裔美国人的医疗叙事中识别潜在影响因素和干预途径，利用故事叙述的沟通力量来理解医疗结果差距。

Method: 使用LDA技术识别50个非裔美国人故事中的主题，采用开源LLM进行分层摘要：先对单个故事摘要，再对同一主题的故事摘要进行汇总，最后用GPT4评估摘要质量。

Abstract: Storytelling is a powerful form of communication and may provide insights
into factors contributing to gaps in healthcare outcomes. To determine whether
Large Language Models (LLMs) can identify potential underlying factors and
avenues for intervention, we performed topic-aware hierarchical summarization
of narratives from African American (AA) storytellers. Fifty transcribed
stories of AA experiences were used to identify topics in their experience
using the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) technique. Stories about a given
topic were summarized using an open-source LLM-based hierarchical summarization
approach. Topic summaries were generated by summarizing across story summaries
for each story that addressed a given topic. Generated topic summaries were
rated for fabrication, accuracy, comprehensiveness, and usefulness by the GPT4
model, and the model's reliability was validated against the original story
summaries by two domain experts. 26 topics were identified in the fifty AA
stories. The GPT4 ratings suggest that topic summaries were free from
fabrication, highly accurate, comprehensive, and useful. The reliability of GPT
ratings compared to expert assessments showed moderate to high agreement. Our
approach identified AA experience-relevant topics such as health behaviors,
interactions with medical team members, caregiving and symptom management,
among others. Such insights could help researchers identify potential factors
and interventions by learning from unstructured narratives in an efficient
manner-leveraging the communicative power of storytelling. The use of LDA and
LLMs to identify and summarize the experience of AA individuals suggests a
variety of possible avenues for health research and possible clinical
improvements to support patients and caregivers, thereby ultimately improving
health outcomes.

Motivation: 现有NLP研究将专利审查简化为预测任务，忽略了审查员基于丰富信息进行的逐步评估过程，难以衡量技术在专利审查中的真实能力。

Method: 构建PANORAMA数据集，将审查过程分解为序列化基准任务，模拟专利专业人员的审查流程，包括原始申请、引用文献、驳回通知和授权通知等完整决策轨迹。

Result: 研究发现LLM在检索相关现有技术和定位关键段落方面相对有效，但在评估专利权利要求的新颖性和非显而易见性方面表现不佳。

Conclusion: 推进NLP在专利领域的应用需要更深入理解真实世界的专利审查过程，PANORAMA数据集为此提供了基础。

Abstract: Patent examination remains an ongoing challenge in the NLP literature even
after the advent of large language models (LLMs), as it requires an extensive
yet nuanced human judgment on whether a submitted claim meets the statutory
standards of novelty and non-obviousness against previously granted claims --
prior art -- in expert domains. Previous NLP studies have approached this
challenge as a prediction task (e.g., forecasting grant outcomes) with
high-level proxies such as similarity metrics or classifiers trained on
historical labels. However, this approach often overlooks the step-by-step
evaluations that examiners must make with profound information, including
rationales for the decisions provided in office actions documents, which also
makes it harder to measure the current state of techniques in patent review
processes. To fill this gap, we construct PANORAMA, a dataset of 8,143 U.S.
patent examination records that preserves the full decision trails, including
original applications, all cited references, Non-Final Rejections, and Notices
of Allowance. Also, PANORAMA decomposes the trails into sequential benchmarks
that emulate patent professionals' patent review processes and allow
researchers to examine large language models' capabilities at each step of
them. Our findings indicate that, although LLMs are relatively effective at
retrieving relevant prior art and pinpointing the pertinent paragraphs, they
struggle to assess the novelty and non-obviousness of patent claims. We discuss
these results and argue that advancing NLP, including LLMs, in the patent
domain requires a deeper understanding of real-world patent examination. Our
dataset is openly available at

### [194] [Mutual Wanting in Human--AI Interaction: Empirical Evidence from Large-Scale Analysis of GPT Model Transitions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24796)
*HaoYang Shang,Xuan Liu*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 该研究引入"相互期望"概念分析用户与AI系统间的双向期望动态，通过论坛评论分析和控制实验验证了人类-AI交互中的期望模式，开发了M-WAF框架用于用户体验管理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型的快速发展造成了用户与AI系统之间复杂的双向期望，这些期望动态尚未得到充分理解，需要系统性的实证研究。

Method: 分析主要AI论坛的用户评论，进行跨多个OpenAI模型的受控实验，使用双算法主题建模和多维特征提取等先进NLP技术。

Result: 近半数用户使用拟人化语言，信任显著超过背叛语言，用户可分为不同的"相互期望"类型，识别了可测量的期望违反模式并量化了模型发布后的期望-现实差距。

Conclusion: 相互期望是一个可测量的现象，对构建更值得信赖和关系感知的AI系统具有明确意义，开发的M-WAF框架具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: The rapid evolution of large language models (LLMs) creates complex
bidirectional expectations between users and AI systems that are poorly
understood. We introduce the concept of "mutual wanting" to analyze these
expectations during major model transitions. Through analysis of user comments
from major AI forums and controlled experiments across multiple OpenAI models,
we provide the first large-scale empirical validation of bidirectional desire
dynamics in human-AI interaction. Our findings reveal that nearly half of users
employ anthropomorphic language, trust significantly exceeds betrayal language,
and users cluster into distinct "mutual wanting" types. We identify measurable
expectation violation patterns and quantify the expectation-reality gap
following major model releases. Using advanced NLP techniques including
dual-algorithm topic modeling and multi-dimensional feature extraction, we
develop the Mutual Wanting Alignment Framework (M-WAF) with practical
applications for proactive user experience management and AI system design.
These findings establish mutual wanting as a measurable phenomenon with clear
implications for building more trustworthy and relationally-aware AI systems.

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 开发了一个基于eFLINT规范语言的自动化规范推理工具，用于行政法案件管理，确保程序规范执行并提高司法可及性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 政府机构在处理行政法案件时需要应对众多法律法规，目前主要依靠人工执行规范，这导致错误、延迟和司法可及性受限的问题

Method: 实现了一个模型驱动的案件管理工具，通过与eFLINT规范语言解释器交互来实现适应性和规范执行

Result: 开发出了能够确保程序规范遵循并提供决策推理透明度的工具

Conclusion: 该工具有助于提高公民的司法可及性，并提出了进一步发展的方向

Abstract: Governmental organisations cope with many laws and policies when handling
administrative law cases. Making sure these norms are enforced in the handling
of cases is for the most part done manually. However, enforcing policies can
get complicated and time consuming with ever-changing (interpretations of) laws
and varying cases. This introduces errors and delays in the decision-making
process and therefore limits the access to justice for citizens. A potential
solution is offered by our tool in which norms are enforced using automated
normative reasoning. By ensuring the procedural norms are followed and
transparency can be provided about the reasoning behind a decision to citizens,
the tool benefits the access to justice for citizens. In this paper we report
on the implementation of a model-driven case management tool for administrative
law cases, based on a set of requirements elicited during earlier research. Our
tool achieves adaptability and norm enforcement by interacting with an
interpreter for eFLINT, a domain-specific language for norm specification. We
report on the current state of the case management tool and suggest directions
for further development.

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 提出了叙事连续性测试(NCT)框架，用于评估AI系统的身份持久性和历时连贯性，揭示了当前无状态LLM在跨时间对话中的连续性缺陷。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于大语言模型的AI系统虽然能生成连贯内容，但缺乏持久状态，每次推理都需从头重建上下文，无法维持跨时间交互的身份一致性。

Method: 定义了五个必要维度：情境记忆、目标持久性、自主自我修正、风格语义稳定性、角色连续性，并通过案例分析验证当前架构的系统性失败。

Result: 案例分析显示在无状态推理下存在可预测的连续性失败，当前LLM架构无法支持长期身份和目标的连贯性。

Conclusion: NCT将AI评估从性能转向持久性，为未来支持长期身份和目标连贯性的基准测试和架构设计提供了概念要求。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence systems based on large language models (LLMs) can now
generate coherent text, music, and images, yet they operate without a
persistent state: each inference reconstructs context from scratch. This paper
introduces the Narrative Continuity Test (NCT) -- a conceptual framework for
evaluating identity persistence and diachronic coherence in AI systems. Unlike
capability benchmarks that assess task performance, the NCT examines whether an
LLM remains the same interlocutor across time and interaction gaps. The
framework defines five necessary axes -- Situated Memory, Goal Persistence,
Autonomous Self-Correction, Stylistic & Semantic Stability, and Persona/Role
Continuity -- and explains why current architectures systematically fail to
support them. Case analyses (Character.AI, Grok, Replit, Air Canada) show
predictable continuity failures under stateless inference. The NCT reframes AI
evaluation from performance to persistence, outlining conceptual requirements
for future benchmarks and architectural designs that could sustain long-term
identity and goal coherence in generative models.

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 该论文针对NLP模型评估中存在的严重地理文化偏见问题，提出了一个针对拉丁美洲的大规模刻板印象数据集和动态数据收集方法，以弥补现有英语中心化基准的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有NLP模型评估基准过度集中于英语和美国人口统计数据，导致拉丁美洲等地区严重缺乏适当的刻板印象评估资源，无法有效评估和减轻语言技术对有害区域刻板印象的传播。

Method: 通过与拉丁美洲当地社区合作开发大规模刻板印象数据集，并提出一种新颖的动态数据收集方法，将新刻板印象条目的收集与现有数据的验证整合在统一工作流程中。

Result: 该方法产生了比静态收集方法覆盖范围更广、区域细节更丰富的数据资源，为拉丁美洲提供了重要的公平性评估工具。

Conclusion: 这种新方法可应用于收集其他类型的社会文化知识，该数据集为解决拉丁美洲公平性资源的地理文化赤字提供了关键新资源，支持稳健的刻板印象评估。

Abstract: The evaluation of societal biases in NLP models is critically hindered by a
glaring geo-cultural gap, as existing benchmarks are overwhelmingly
English-centric and focused on U.S. demographics. This leaves regions such as
Latin America severely underserved, making it impossible to adequately assess
or mitigate the perpetuation of harmful regional stereotypes by language
technologies. To address this gap, we introduce a new, large-scale dataset of
stereotypes developed through targeted community partnerships within Latin
America. Furthermore, we present a novel dynamic data collection methodology
that uniquely integrates the sourcing of new stereotype entries and the
validation of existing data within a single, unified workflow. This combined
approach results in a resource with significantly broader coverage and higher
regional nuance than static collection methods. We believe that this new method
could be applicable in gathering sociocultural knowledge of other kinds, and
that this dataset provides a crucial new resource enabling robust stereotype
evaluation and significantly addressing the geo-cultural deficit in fairness
resources for Latin America.

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 本文建立了数据经济学作为一个连贯的研究领域，通过分析数据的独特属性、记录AI训练数据交易模式，并提出数据单元层次结构，为理解数据在AI生产中的作用提供了系统框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI实验室耗尽公共数据并转向专有数据源（交易额达数亿美元），计算机科学、经济学、法律和政策研究变得碎片化，需要建立统一的数据经济学框架来理解数据在AI生产中的核心作用。

Method: 1) 分析数据的独特属性（非竞争性、上下文依赖性和通过污染产生的竞争性）；2) 系统记录2020-2025年AI训练数据交易；3) 提出可交换数据单元的正式层次结构（token、记录、数据集、语料库、流）。

Result: 揭示了市场持续碎片化、五种不同的定价机制（从单位许可到委托），以及大多数交易将原始创作者排除在补偿之外。建立了数据经济学的基础框架。

Conclusion: 提出了数据经济学的四个开放研究问题：衡量上下文依赖价值、平衡治理与隐私、估计数据对生产的贡献、以及为异质组合商品设计机制，为这一新兴领域奠定了基础。

Abstract: Despite data's central role in AI production, it remains the least understood
input. As AI labs exhaust public data and turn to proprietary sources, with
deals reaching hundreds of millions of dollars, research across computer
science, economics, law, and policy has fragmented. We establish data economics
as a coherent field through three contributions. First, we characterize data's
distinctive properties -- nonrivalry, context dependence, and emergent rivalry
through contamination -- and trace historical precedents for market formation
in commodities such as oil and grain. Second, we present systematic
documentation of AI training data deals from 2020 to 2025, revealing persistent
market fragmentation, five distinct pricing mechanisms (from per-unit licensing
to commissioning), and that most deals exclude original creators from
compensation. Third, we propose a formal hierarchy of exchangeable data units
(token, record, dataset, corpus, stream) and argue for data's explicit
representation in production functions. Building on these foundations, we
outline four open research problems foundational to data economics: measuring
context-dependent value, balancing governance with privacy, estimating data's
contribution to production, and designing mechanisms for heterogeneous,
compositional goods.

Motivation: 为STEM少数群体学生设计ML课程，旨在将数学基础与社会技术影响联系起来，让学生能够自信地参与AI讨论。

Method: 采用"框架优先"方法，教授概率建模语言和形式主义，使用概率编程降低数学障碍，通过"星际假设医院"主题引入概念，结合反叙事和开放式案例研究培养辩证思维。

Result: 课程帮助学生认识到自身独特视角的价值，培养他们作为技术专家和批判性公民参与AI讨论的能力。

Conclusion: 该课程成功地将技术教学与社会伦理考量相结合，为STEM少数群体学生提供了参与AI领域的有效途径。

Abstract: We present a new undergraduate ML course at our institution, a small liberal
arts college serving students minoritized in STEM, designed to empower students
to critically connect the mathematical foundations of ML with its
sociotechnical implications. We propose a "framework-focused" approach,
teaching students the language and formalism of probabilistic modeling while
leveraging probabilistic programming to lower mathematical barriers. We
introduce methodological concepts through a whimsical, yet realistic theme, the
"Intergalactic Hypothetical Hospital," to make the content both relevant and
accessible. Finally, we pair each technical innovation with counter-narratives
that challenge its value using real, open-ended case-studies to cultivate
dialectical thinking. By encouraging creativity in modeling and highlighting
unresolved ethical challenges, we help students recognize the value and need of
their unique perspectives, empowering them to participate confidently in AI
discourse as technologists and critical citizens.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统劳动力指标无法捕捉AI能力的涟漪效应，只能衡量就业结果而非AI与人类技能重叠的潜在暴露风险。

Method: 使用大型人口模型模拟1.51亿工人作为自主代理，执行超过32,000种技能并与数千种AI工具交互，引入Iceberg指数测量AI可执行技能的工资价值。

Result: 可见的AI采用集中在计算和技术领域（2.2%工资价值，约2110亿美元）只是冰山一角，技术能力暴露在行政、金融和专业服务领域达11.7%（约1.2万亿美元），是前者的五倍且地理分布更广。

Conclusion: 传统经济指标无法充分捕捉AI经济中的技能暴露，需要新指数来识别暴露热点、优先投资并在实施前测试干预措施。

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence is reshaping America's \$9.4 trillion labor market,
with cascading effects that extend far beyond visible technology sectors. When
AI transforms quality control tasks in automotive plants, consequences spread
through logistics networks, supply chains, and local service economies. Yet
traditional workforce metrics cannot capture these ripple effects: they measure
employment outcomes after disruption occurs, not where AI capabilities overlap
with human skills before adoption crystallizes. Project Iceberg addresses this
gap using Large Population Models to simulate the human-AI labor market,
representing 151 million workers as autonomous agents executing over 32,000
skills and interacting with thousands of AI tools. It introduces the Iceberg
Index, a skills-centered metric that measures the wage value of skills AI
systems can perform within each occupation. The Index captures technical
exposure, where AI can perform occupational tasks, not displacement outcomes or
adoption timelines. Analysis shows that visible AI adoption concentrated in
computing and technology (2.2% of wage value, approx \$211 billion) represents
only the tip of the iceberg. Technical capability extends far below the surface
through cognitive automation spanning administrative, financial, and
professional services (11.7%, approx \$1.2 trillion). This exposure is fivefold
larger and geographically distributed across all states rather than confined to
coastal hubs. Traditional indicators such as GDP, income, and unemployment
explain less than 5% of this skills-based variation, underscoring why new
indices are needed to capture exposure in the AI economy. By simulating how
these capabilities may spread under scenarios, Iceberg enables policymakers and
business leaders to identify exposure hotspots, prioritize investments, and
test interventions before committing billions to implementation

Motivation: 生成模型在不同全球文化背景和语言中的性能表现不佳，需要专门扩展数据资源来包含全球语境和语言，以增强和评估生成式AI模型的跨文化能力。

Method: 构建可重复、可扩展的多管齐下流程，用于收集和贡献具有文化显著性的多语言数据。

Result: 开发了一个系统化流程来收集多语言文化数据，能够评估模型的全球适用性状态。

Conclusion: 这种数据可以帮助识别和改善跨文化差距，从而提升生成式AI模型在不同文化背景下的表现。

Abstract: Generative models are known to have reduced performance in different global
cultural contexts and languages. While continual data updates have been
commonly conducted to improve overall model performance, bolstering and
evaluating this cross-cultural competence of generative AI models requires data
resources to be intentionally expanded to include global contexts and
languages. In this work, we construct a repeatable, scalable, multi-pronged
pipeline to collect and contribute culturally salient, multilingual data. We
posit that such data can assess the state of the global applicability of our
models and thus, in turn, help identify and improve upon cross-cultural gaps.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 计算机科学教育者越来越多地将开源贡献纳入课程，以应对GenAI带来的更高期望，并在竞争激烈的就业市场中改善就业结果。但雇主如何看待学生的开源贡献尚不清楚。

Method: 定性研究：对美国招聘经理进行访谈，创建包含期望特质和开源展示方式的"招聘经理协议"；定量研究：基于期望价值理论对650名美国公立大学本科生进行调查。

Result: 招聘经理看重传统CS课程难以教授的非技术特质（如主动性），雇主对开源贡献中展示这些特质的方式有共同期望。查看招聘经理协议能提高学生参与开源项目的动机。

Conclusion: 开源贡献可能帮助CS本科生获得工作，但这需要多个领域的持续参与。教育者可通过分享雇主期望来激励学生，但需要进一步研究这是否会改变他们的行为。

Abstract: Computer science educators are increasingly integrating open source
contributions into classes to prepare students for higher expectations due to
GenAI, and to improve employment outcomes in an increasingly competitive job
market. However, little is known about how employers view student open source
contributions. This paper addresses two research questions qualitatively: what
traits do employers desire for entry-level hires in 2025, and how can they be
demonstrated through open source contributions? It also tests quantitatively
the hypothesis that student knowledge of employers' expectations will improve
their motivation to work on open source projects. To answer our qualitative
questions, we conducted interviews with US hiring managers. We collaborated
with each interviewee to create a "hiring manager agreement," which listed
desirable traits and specific ways to demonstrate them through open source,
along with a promise to interview some students meeting the criteria. To
evaluate our quantitative hypothesis, we surveyed 650 undergraduates attending
public universities in the US using an instrument based on expectancy-value
theory. Hiring managers wanted many non-technical traits that are difficult to
teach in traditional CS classes, such as initiative. There were many
commonalities in how employers wanted to see these traits demonstrated in open
source contributions. Viewing hiring manager agreements improved student
motivation to contribute to open source projects. Our findings suggest that
open source contributions may help CS undergraduates get hired, but this
requires sustained engagement in multiple areas. Educators can motivate
students by sharing employer expectations, but further work is required to
determine if this changes their behavior.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI正在取代任务、介入高风险决策并产生大量合成内容，这动摇了工作、身份认同和社会信任，因此需要找到有效的人类应对策略。

Method: 通过定义韧性的三个层面（心理、社会、组织），并综合早期证据来展示这些能力如何缓冲AI带来的负面影响。

Result: 研究发现韧性能力可以减轻个体压力，通过社会支持减少职业倦怠，并通过团队规范和风险响应治理降低AI工作流程中的无声失败。

Conclusion: 通过将AI讨论重新聚焦于可操作的人类韧性，本文为政策制定者、教育工作者和操作者提供了保护人类能动性和引导负责任AI采用的实际视角。

Abstract: AI is displacing tasks, mediating high-stakes decisions, and flooding
communication with synthetic content, unsettling work, identity, and social
trust. We argue that the decisive human countermeasure is resilience. We define
resilience across three layers: psychological, including emotion regulation,
meaning-making, cognitive flexibility; social, including trust, social capital,
coordinated response; organizational, including psychological safety, feedback
mechanisms, and graceful degradation. We synthesize early evidence that these
capacities buffer individual strain, reduce burnout through social support, and
lower silent failure in AI-mediated workflows through team norms and
risk-responsive governance. We also show that resilience can be cultivated
through training that complements rather than substitutes for structural
safeguards. By reframing the AI debate around actionable human resilience, this
article offers policymakers, educators, and operators a practical lens to
preserve human agency and steer responsible adoption.

Conclusion: 文章最后提出了解决研究算法及其对用户和社会影响的实际、伦理和法律挑战的具体建议。

Abstract: Algorithmic agents permeate every instant of our online existence. Based on
our digital profiles built from the massive surveillance of our digital
existence, algorithmic agents rank search results, filter our emails, hide and
show news items on social networks feeds, try to guess what products we might
buy next for ourselves and for others, what movies we want to watch, and when
we might be pregnant. Algorithmic agents select, filter, and recommend
products, information, and people. Increasingly, algorithmic agents don't just
select from the range of human created alternatives, but also they create.
Burgeoning algorithmic agents are capable of providing us with content made
just for us, and engage with us through one-of-a-kind, personalized
interactions. Studying these algorithmic agents presents a host of
methodological, ethical, and logistical challenges. The objectives of our paper
are two-fold. The first aim is to describe one possible approach to researching
the individual and societal effects of algorithmic recommenders, and to share
our experiences with the academic community. The second is to contribute to a
more fundamental discussion about the ethical and legal issues of "tracking the
trackers", as well as the costs and trade-offs involved. Our paper will
contribute to the discussion on the relative merits, costs and benefits of
different approaches to ethically and legally sound research on algorithmic
governance. We will argue that besides shedding light on how users interact
with algorithmic agents, we also need to be able to understand how different
methods of monitoring our algorithmically controlled digital environments
compare to each other in terms of costs and benefits. We conclude our article
with a number of concrete suggestions for how to address the practical, ethical
and legal challenges of researching algorithms and their effects on users and
society.

Motivation: 追踪墙在互联网上普遍存在，用户通常被迫同意追踪才能访问网站，但调查显示大多数人认为追踪墙不公平且不可接受。

Method: 分析ePrivacy指令和GDPR下追踪墙的合法性条件，提供评估同意有效性的情况列表，并探讨欧盟立法者如何监管追踪墙。

Result: 确定了使追踪墙同意无效的具体情况，建议在ePrivacy法规中考虑禁止追踪墙。

Conclusion: 应认真考虑禁止追踪墙，至少在特定情况下，以保护用户隐私权。

Abstract: On the internet, we encounter take-it-or-leave-it choices regarding our
privacy on a daily basis. In Europe, online tracking for targeted advertising
generally requires the internet users' consent to be lawful. Some websites use
a tracking wall, a barrier that visitors can only pass if they consent to
tracking by third parties. When confronted with such a tracking wall, many
people click 'I agree' to tracking. A survey that we conducted shows that most
people find tracking walls unfair and unacceptable. We analyse under which
conditions the ePrivacy Directive and the General Data Protection Regulation
allow tracking walls. We provide a list of circumstances to assess when a
tracking wall makes consent invalid. We also explore how the EU lawmaker could
regulate tracking walls, for instance in the ePrivacy Regulation. It should be
seriously considered to ban tracking walls, at least in certain circumstances.

Motivation: 追踪2020年至2024年美国社交媒体格局在平台、人口统计和政治层面的变化，了解数字公共领域的发展趋势。

Method: 使用2020年和2024年美国国家选举研究(ANES)的全国代表性数据进行对比分析。

Result: 社交媒体整体使用率下降，年轻人和老年人弃用增多；平台市场份额变化，Facebook、YouTube、Twitter/X衰落，TikTok和Reddit增长；用户群体老龄化、教育程度提高、更多元化；政治倾向向共和党偏移，Twitter/X政治发帖从民主党转向共和党近50个百分点；政治发帖与情感极化高度相关。

Conclusion: 随着普通用户退出而极化党派保持活跃，网络公共领域变得更小、更尖锐、意识形态更极端。

Abstract: Using nationally representative data from the 2020 and 2024 American National
Election Studies (ANES), this paper traces how the U.S. social media landscape
has shifted across platforms, demographics, and politics. Overall platform use
has declined, with the youngest and oldest Americans increasingly abstaining
from social media altogether. Facebook, YouTube, and Twitter/X have lost
ground, while TikTok and Reddit have grown modestly, reflecting a more
fragmented digital public sphere. Platform audiences have aged and become
slightly more educated and diverse. Politically, most platforms have moved
