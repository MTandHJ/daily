### [1] [GAZE:Governance-Aware pre-annotation for Zero-shot World Model Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14992)
*Leela Krishna,Mengyang Zhao,Saicharithreddy Pasula,Harshit Rajgarhia,Abhishek Mukherji*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GAZE pipeline自动化将原始长视频转换为丰富的世界模型训练数据，通过多模态预标注和结构化输出，显著提升标注效率和数据质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统手动标注大规模多模态数据集成本高、效率低，阻碍了稳健世界模型的训练。

Method: 采用三阶段流程：标准化360度视频格式、应用AI模型进行多模态预标注、整合信号为结构化输出供人工验证。

Result: 节省每审核小时约19分钟，减少80%以上人工审核量，生成高质量、隐私保护的数据集。

Conclusion: GAZE提供了可扩展的高质量世界模型训练数据生成方案，平衡了吞吐量和治理要求。

Abstract: Training robust world models requires large-scale, precisely labeled
multimodal datasets, a process historically bottlenecked by slow and expensive
manual annotation. We present a production-tested GAZE pipeline that automates
the conversion of raw, long-form video into rich, task-ready supervision for
world-model training. Our system (i) normalizes proprietary 360-degree formats
into standard views and shards them for parallel processing; (ii) applies a
suite of AI models (scene understanding, object tracking, audio transcription,
PII/NSFW/minor detection) for dense, multimodal pre-annotation; and (iii)
consolidates signals into a structured output specification for rapid human
validation.
  The GAZE workflow demonstrably yields efficiency gains (~19 minutes saved per
review hour) and reduces human review volume by >80% through conservative
auto-skipping of low-salience segments. By increasing label density and
consistency while integrating privacy safeguards and chain-of-custody metadata,
our method generates high-fidelity, privacy-aware datasets directly consumable
for learning cross-modal dynamics and action-conditioned prediction. We detail
our orchestration, model choices, and data dictionary to provide a scalable
blueprint for generating high-quality world model training data without
sacrificing throughput or governance.

### [2] [PC-UNet: An Enforcing Poisson Statistics U-Net for Positron Emission Tomography Denoising](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14995)
*Yang Shi,Jingchao Wang,Liangsi Lu,Mingxuan Huang,Ruixin He,Yifeng Xie,Hanqian Liu,Minzhe Guo,Yangyang Liang,Weipeng Zhang,Zimeng Li,Xuhang Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出PC-UNet模型和PVMC-Loss损失函数，用于解决PET图像低剂量扫描时的泊松噪声问题，提高图像保真度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PET临床应用中，高剂量扫描会增加辐射暴露风险，而降低剂量会引入泊松噪声，现有去噪方法无法有效处理这种噪声，导致图像失真和伪影。

Method: 开发了Poisson Consistent U-Net (PC-UNet)模型，提出Poisson Variance and Mean Consistency Loss (PVMC-Loss)，该损失函数结合物理数据特性，在方差和梯度适应方面具有统计无偏性。

Result: 在PET数据集上的测试表明，PC-UNet能够提高物理一致性和图像保真度。

Conclusion: PC-UNet能够有效整合物理信息，为低剂量PET成像提供了一种有效的去噪解决方案。

Abstract: Positron Emission Tomography (PET) is crucial in medicine, but its clinical
use is limited due to high signal-to-noise ratio doses increasing radiation
exposure. Lowering doses increases Poisson noise, which current denoising
methods fail to handle, causing distortions and artifacts. We propose a Poisson
Consistent U-Net (PC-UNet) model with a new Poisson Variance and Mean
Consistency Loss (PVMC-Loss) that incorporates physical data to improve image
fidelity. PVMC-Loss is statistically unbiased in variance and gradient
adaptation, acting as a Generalized Method of Moments implementation, offering
robustness to minor data mismatches. Tests on PET datasets show PC-UNet
improves physical consistency and image fidelity, proving its ability to
integrate physical information effectively.

### [3] [DeLeaker: Dynamic Inference-Time Reweighting For Semantic Leakage Mitigation in Text-to-Image Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15015)
*Mor Ventura,Michael Toker,Or Patashnik,Yonatan Belinkov,Roi Reichart*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DeLeaker是一种轻量级、无需优化的推理时方法，通过直接干预模型的注意力图来缓解文本到图像模型中的语义泄漏问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文本到图像模型容易受到语义泄漏的影响，即不同实体间语义相关特征的意外传递。现有缓解策略通常基于优化或依赖外部输入。

Method: DeLeaker在扩散过程中动态重新加权注意力图，抑制过度的跨实体交互，同时增强每个实体的身份特征。

Result: 实验表明DeLeaker在所有基线方法中表现最佳，即使基线方法使用外部信息，DeLeaker也能有效缓解泄漏而不影响保真度或质量。

Conclusion: 这些结果强调了注意力控制的价值，为开发更语义精确的文本到图像模型铺平了道路。

Abstract: Text-to-Image (T2I) models have advanced rapidly, yet they remain vulnerable
to semantic leakage, the unintended transfer of semantically related features
between distinct entities. Existing mitigation strategies are often
optimization-based or dependent on external inputs. We introduce DeLeaker, a
lightweight, optimization-free inference-time approach that mitigates leakage
by directly intervening on the model's attention maps. Throughout the diffusion
process, DeLeaker dynamically reweights attention maps to suppress excessive
cross-entity interactions while strengthening the identity of each entity. To
support systematic evaluation, we introduce SLIM (Semantic Leakage in IMages),
the first dataset dedicated to semantic leakage, comprising 1,130
human-verified samples spanning diverse scenarios, together with a novel
automatic evaluation framework. Experiments demonstrate that DeLeaker
consistently outperforms all baselines, even when they are provided with
external information, achieving effective leakage mitigation without
compromising fidelity or quality. These results underscore the value of
attention control and pave the way for more semantically precise T2I models.

### [4] [UrbanVerse: Scaling Urban Simulation by Watching City-Tour Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15018)
*Mingxuan Liu,Honglin He,Elisa Ricci,Wayne Wu,Bolei Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UrbanVerse是一个数据驱动的真实到仿真系统，可将众包城市游览视频转换为物理感知的交互式仿真场景，包含10万+标注的3D城市资产库和自动生成流水线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的人工制作或程序生成的仿真场景缺乏可扩展性或无法捕捉真实世界的复杂性，而城市嵌入式AI代理需要多样化的高保真城市环境进行训练。

Method: 系统包括UrbanVerse-100K（10万+带语义和物理属性的城市3D资产库）和UrbanVerse-Gen（从视频提取场景布局并使用检索资产实例化度量尺度3D仿真的自动流水线）。

Result: UrbanVerse提供160个来自24个国家的高质量构建场景，在仿真中训练的策略表现出扩展幂律和强泛化能力，仿真成功率提高+6.3%，零样本仿真到真实迁移提高+30.1%。

Conclusion: UrbanVerse场景保留了真实世界的语义和布局，实现了与人工制作场景相当的人类评估真实感，能够仅通过两次干预完成300米真实世界任务。

Abstract: Urban embodied AI agents, ranging from delivery robots to quadrupeds, are
increasingly populating our cities, navigating chaotic streets to provide
last-mile connectivity. Training such agents requires diverse, high-fidelity
urban environments to scale, yet existing human-crafted or procedurally
generated simulation scenes either lack scalability or fail to capture
real-world complexity. We introduce UrbanVerse, a data-driven real-to-sim
system that converts crowd-sourced city-tour videos into physics-aware,
interactive simulation scenes. UrbanVerse consists of: (i) UrbanVerse-100K, a
repository of 100k+ annotated urban 3D assets with semantic and physical
attributes, and (ii) UrbanVerse-Gen, an automatic pipeline that extracts scene
layouts from video and instantiates metric-scale 3D simulations using retrieved
assets. Running in IsaacSim, UrbanVerse offers 160 high-quality constructed
scenes from 24 countries, along with a curated benchmark of 10 artist-designed
test scenes. Experiments show that UrbanVerse scenes preserve real-world
semantics and layouts, achieving human-evaluated realism comparable to manually
crafted scenes. In urban navigation, policies trained in UrbanVerse exhibit
scaling power laws and strong generalization, improving success by +6.3% in
simulation and +30.1% in zero-shot sim-to-real transfer comparing to prior
methods, accomplishing a 300 m real-world mission with only two interventions.

### [5] [NANO3D: A Training-Free Approach for Efficient 3D Editing Without Masks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15019)
*Junliang Ye,Shenghao Xie,Ruowen Zhao,Zhengyi Wang,Hongyu Yan,Wenqiang Zu,Lei Ma,Jun Zhu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Nano3D是一个无需训练的3D物体编辑框架，通过FlowEdit和TRELLIS实现局部编辑，并引入Voxel/Slat-Merge策略保持结构一致性，同时构建了首个大规模3D编辑数据集Nano3D-Edit-100k。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前3D编辑方法效率低下、不一致且难以保持未编辑区域的问题，传统方法依赖多视角渲染和重建，导致伪影且实用性有限。

Method: 将FlowEdit集成到TRELLIS中，通过前视图渲染指导局部编辑，并引入区域感知合并策略Voxel/Slat-Merge，自适应保持结构保真度。

Result: 实验表明Nano3D在3D一致性和视觉质量方面优于现有方法，同时构建了包含10万+高质量3D编辑对的大规模数据集。

Conclusion: 该工作解决了算法设计和数据可用性的长期挑战，显著提升了3D编辑的通用性和可靠性，为前馈式3D编辑模型的发展奠定了基础。

Abstract: 3D object editing is essential for interactive content creation in gaming,
animation, and robotics, yet current approaches remain inefficient,
inconsistent, and often fail to preserve unedited regions. Most methods rely on
editing multi-view renderings followed by reconstruction, which introduces
artifacts and limits practicality. To address these challenges, we propose
Nano3D, a training-free framework for precise and coherent 3D object editing
without masks. Nano3D integrates FlowEdit into TRELLIS to perform localized
edits guided by front-view renderings, and further introduces region-aware
merging strategies, Voxel/Slat-Merge, which adaptively preserve structural
fidelity by ensuring consistency between edited and unedited areas. Experiments
demonstrate that Nano3D achieves superior 3D consistency and visual quality
compared with existing methods. Based on this framework, we construct the first
large-scale 3D editing datasets Nano3D-Edit-100k, which contains over 100,000
high-quality 3D editing pairs. This work addresses long-standing challenges in
both algorithm design and data availability, significantly improving the
generality and reliability of 3D editing, and laying the groundwork for the
development of feed-forward 3D editing models. Project

TL;DR: ECHO是一个从社交媒体真实使用证据构建图像生成基准的框架，通过分析GPT-4o Image Gen的31,000多个提示，发现了现有基准中缺失的创造性任务，并能更好地区分最先进模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准往往滞后于图像生成模型的新能力，无法捕捉新兴使用场景，导致社区对进展的认知与正式评估之间存在差距。

Method: 从展示新颖提示和定性用户判断的社交媒体帖子中构建基准框架，收集并分析了GPT-4o Image Gen的31,000多个提示。

Result: ECHO发现了现有基准中缺失的创造性复杂任务，能更清晰地区分最先进模型，并通过社区反馈为模型质量指标设计提供信息。

Conclusion: 从真实世界使用证据构建基准能更好地反映模型的实际能力，为图像生成模型的评估提供了更准确的方法。

Abstract: Recent advances in image generation, often driven by proprietary systems like
GPT-4o Image Gen, regularly introduce new capabilities that reshape how users
interact with these models. Existing benchmarks often lag behind and fail to
capture these emerging use cases, leaving a gap between community perceptions
of progress and formal evaluation. To address this, we present ECHO, a
framework for constructing benchmarks directly from real-world evidence of
model use: social media posts that showcase novel prompts and qualitative user
judgments. Applying this framework to GPT-4o Image Gen, we construct a dataset
of over 31,000 prompts curated from such posts. Our analysis shows that ECHO
(1) discovers creative and complex tasks absent from existing benchmarks, such
as re-rendering product labels across languages or generating receipts with
specified totals, (2) more clearly distinguishes state-of-the-art models from
alternatives, and (3) surfaces community feedback that we use to inform the
design of metrics for model quality (e.g., measuring observed shifts in color,
identity, and structure). Our website is at https://echo-bench.github.io.

### [7] [LoRAverse: A Submodular Framework to Retrieve Diverse Adapters for Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15022)
*Mert Sonmezer,Matthew Zheng,Pinar Yanardag*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种基于子模框架的方法，用于从海量LoRA适配器中选择最相关且多样化的模型，解决用户在选择和使用适配器时的困难。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LoRA模型虽然能够个性化预训练扩散模型，但平台上超过10万个适配器缺乏结构化组织，用户难以导航、选择和有效使用最合适的适配器。

Method: 将LoRA模型选择任务构建为组合优化问题，并提出一种新颖的子模框架来解决这个问题。

Result: 定量和定性实验表明，该方法能够在广泛领域生成多样化的输出。

Conclusion: 提出的子模框架能够有效解决LoRA适配器选择问题，为用户提供相关且多样化的模型选择。

Abstract: Low-rank Adaptation (LoRA) models have revolutionized the personalization of
pre-trained diffusion models by enabling fine-tuning through low-rank,
factorized weight matrices specifically optimized for attention layers. These
models facilitate the generation of highly customized content across a variety
of objects, individuals, and artistic styles without the need for extensive
retraining. Despite the availability of over 100K LoRA adapters on platforms
like Civit.ai, users often face challenges in navigating, selecting, and
effectively utilizing the most suitable adapters due to their sheer volume,
diversity, and lack of structured organization. This paper addresses the
problem of selecting the most relevant and diverse LoRA models from this vast
database by framing the task as a combinatorial optimization problem and
proposing a novel submodular framework. Our quantitative and qualitative
experiments demonstrate that our method generates diverse outputs across a wide
range of domains.

### [8] [MOBIUS: Big-to-Mobile Universal Instance Segmentation via Multi-modal Bottleneck Fusion and Calibrated Decoder Pruning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15026)
*Mattia Segu,Marta Tintore Gazulla,Yongqin Xian,Luc Van Gool,Federico Tombari*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MOBIUS是一个用于通用实例分割的基础模型系列，通过瓶颈像素解码器、语言引导的不确定性校准损失和统一训练策略，在减少55%像素FLOPs和75%变换器解码器FLOPs的同时保持SOTA性能，仅需1/3训练迭代次数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基础模型虽然实现了SOTA的实例级感知性能，但计算成本过高限制了在资源受限平台上的部署。需要设计能够在边缘设备上高效部署而不牺牲性能的架构。

Method: 1) 瓶颈像素解码器用于高效多尺度和多模态融合；2) 语言引导的不确定性校准损失用于自适应解码器剪枝；3) 简化的统一训练策略。

Result: MOBIUS在减少55%像素FLOPs和75%变换器解码器FLOPs的同时保持SOTA性能，仅需1/3训练迭代次数，在高性能计算平台和移动设备上都建立了新的高效分割基准。

Conclusion: MOBIUS通过创新的架构设计实现了Pareto最优的缩放，为从高端加速器到移动硬件的各种设备提供了高效的实例分割解决方案，在保持性能的同时显著降低了计算需求。

Abstract: Scaling up model size and training data has advanced foundation models for
instance-level perception, achieving state-of-the-art in-domain and zero-shot
performance across object detection and segmentation. However, their high
computational cost limits adoption on resource-constrained platforms. We first
examine the limitations of existing architectures in enabling efficient edge
deployment without compromising performance. We then introduce MOBIUS, a family
of foundation models for universal instance segmentation, designed for
Pareto-optimal downscaling to support deployment across devices ranging from
high-end accelerators to mobile hardware. To reduce training and inference
demands, we propose: (i) a bottleneck pixel decoder for efficient multi-scale
and multi-modal fusion, (ii) a language-guided uncertainty calibration loss for
adaptive decoder pruning, and (iii) a streamlined, unified training strategy.
Unlike efficient baselines that trade accuracy for reduced complexity, MOBIUS
reduces pixel and transformer decoder FLOPs by up to 55% and 75%, respectively,
while maintaining state-of-the-art performance in just a third of the training
iterations. MOBIUS establishes a new benchmark for efficient segmentation on
both high-performance computing platforms and mobile devices.

TL;DR: COGS框架通过分解种子问题为基本感知和推理因子，然后系统性地重组这些因子与新的图像来生成大量合成问答对，从而在缺乏大规模人工标注的情况下提升多模态大语言模型的推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在标注数据难以获取的领域（如图表、渲染文档和网页等人工图像领域）的推理能力仍然有限，而这些领域在实践中非常丰富但缺乏大规模人工标注的推理数据集。

Method: 提出COGS框架，将每个种子问题分解为原始感知和推理因子，然后系统性地将这些因子与新的图像重新组合，生成大量合成问答对。每个生成的问题都配有子问题和中间答案，支持基于因子级过程奖励的强化学习。

Result: 在图表推理任务上的实验表明，COGS显著提高了对未见问题的性能，在推理密集和组合性问题上的提升最大。使用不同种子数据的因子级混合训练在多个数据集上实现了更好的迁移效果。

Conclusion: COGS框架能够从少量种子问题中为MLLMs提供高级推理能力，且该框架可扩展到图表之外的其他领域如网页。

Abstract: Pretrained multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) demonstrate strong
performance on diverse multimodal tasks, but remain limited in reasoning
capabilities for domains where annotations are difficult to collect. In this
work, we focus on artificial image domains such as charts, rendered documents,
and webpages, which are abundant in practice yet lack large-scale human
annotated reasoning datasets. We introduce COGS (COmposition-Grounded
instruction Synthesis), a data-efficient framework for equipping MLLMs with
advanced reasoning abilities from a small set of seed questions. The key idea
is to decompose each seed question into primitive perception and reasoning
factors, which can then be systematically recomposed with new images to
generate large collections of synthetic question-answer pairs. Each generated
question is paired with subquestions and intermediate answers, enabling
reinforcement learning with factor-level process rewards. Experiments on chart
reasoning show that COGS substantially improves performance on unseen
questions, with the largest gains on reasoning-heavy and compositional
questions. Moreover, training with a factor-level mixture of different seed
data yields better transfer across multiple datasets, suggesting that COGS
induces generalizable capabilities rather than dataset-specific overfitting. We
further demonstrate that the framework extends beyond charts to other domains
such as webpages.

*Yichen Li,Zhiyi Li,Brandon Feng,Dinghuai Zhang,Antonio Torralba*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GDGen是一个从势能角度统一刚体、铰接体和软体动力学的框架，通过引入方向刚度扩展经典弹性动力学，能够从简单运动观察中推断物理属性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数字孪生世界为开发通用具身智能体提供了新机会，但需要统一处理复杂物理行为的框架。

Method: 从势能原理出发，引入方向刚度概念，使用专门网络建模扩展材料属性，采用神经场以几何无关方式表示变形。

Result: 实验表明GDGen能够稳健地统一多种仿真范式，为创建交互式虚拟环境和训练机器人智能体提供多功能基础。

Conclusion: GDGen通过势能视角成功整合了多种物理系统，为复杂动态场景中的虚拟环境和机器人训练提供了统一框架。

Abstract: Digital twin worlds with realistic interactive dynamics presents a new
opportunity to develop generalist embodied agents in scannable environments
with complex physical behaviors. To this end, we present GDGen (Generalized
Representation for Generalized Dynamics Generation), a framework that takes a
potential energy perspective to seamlessly integrate rigid body, articulated
body, and soft body dynamics into a unified, geometry-agnostic system. GDGen
operates from the governing principle that the potential energy for any stable
physical system should be low. This fresh perspective allows us to treat the
world as one holistic entity and infer underlying physical properties from
simple motion observations. We extend classic elastodynamics by introducing
directional stiffness to capture a broad spectrum of physical behaviors,
covering soft elastic, articulated, and rigid body systems. We propose a
specialized network to model the extended material property and employ a neural
field to represent deformation in a geometry-agnostic manner. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that GDGen robustly unifies diverse simulation
paradigms, offering a versatile foundation for creating interactive virtual
environments and training robotic agents in complex, dynamically rich
scenarios.

TL;DR: 提出了COLIPRI编码器家族，通过引入报告生成目标和结合视觉-语言预训练与纯视觉预训练来解决3D医学影像领域数据不足的问题，在多个任务上取得SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D医学影像领域的数据稀缺限制了当前视觉-语言编码器的能力，需要解决数据不足的问题来提升模型性能。

Method: 引入报告生成目标作为额外归纳偏置，结合视觉-语言预训练和纯视觉预训练，利用图像-文本配对数据和纯图像数据，开发了COLIPRI编码器家族。

Result: COLIPRI编码器在报告生成、分类探测和零样本分类任务上达到最先进性能，在语义分割任务上保持竞争力。

Conclusion: 通过引入额外归纳偏置和结合不同预训练方式，能够有效缓解3D医学影像数据不足的问题，显著提升模型在多个任务上的性能。

Abstract: Vision-language pre-training, i.e., aligning images with paired text, is a
powerful paradigm to create encoders that can be directly used for tasks such
as classification and retrieval, and for downstream tasks such as segmentation
and report generation. In the 3D medical image domain, these capabilities allow
vision-language encoders (VLEs) to support radiologists by retrieving patients
with similar abnormalities or predicting likelihoods of abnormality. While the
methodology holds promise, data availability limits the capabilities of current
3D VLEs.
  In this paper, we alleviate the lack of data by injecting additional
inductive biases: introducing a report generation objective and pairing
vision-language pre-training with vision-only pre-training. This allows us to
leverage both image-only and paired image-text 3D datasets, increasing the
total amount of data to which our model is exposed. Through these additional
inductive biases, paired with best practices of the 3D medical imaging domain,
we develop the Comprehensive Language-image Pre-training (COLIPRI) encoder
family. Our COLIPRI encoders achieve state-of-the-art performance in report
generation, classification probing, and zero-shot classification, and remain
competitive for semantic segmentation.

*Jinghao Huang,Yaxiong Chen,Ganchao Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文首次系统性地提出并研究了无人机视频-文本检索任务，针对无人机视频的独特视角和语义特征，提出了多语义自适应挖掘方法，在自建数据集上取得了优于现有方法的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着无人机技术的发展，视频数据量急剧增加，迫切需要高效的语义检索方法。现有跨模态方法主要针对地面视角设计，无法有效建模无人机视频的俯视视角、结构同质性和目标组合多样性等特征。

Method: 提出多语义自适应挖掘方法，包含多语义自适应学习机制，通过帧间动态变化和特定场景区域语义提取来增强理解；采用细粒度词-帧交互，结合自适应语义构建模块、分布驱动语义学习项和多样性语义项；引入跨模态交互特征融合池化机制来减少复杂背景干扰。

Result: 在两个自建的无人机视频-文本数据集上的大量实验表明，MSAM方法在无人机视频-文本检索任务中优于其他现有方法。

Conclusion: 针对无人机场景的专用检索机制是必要的，MSAM方法通过深度模态交互和鲁棒特征表示，有效解决了无人机视频-文本检索的挑战。

Abstract: With the advancement of drone technology, the volume of video data increases
rapidly, creating an urgent need for efficient semantic retrieval. We are the
first to systematically propose and study the drone video-text retrieval (DVTR)
task. Drone videos feature overhead perspectives, strong structural
homogeneity, and diverse semantic expressions of target combinations, which
challenge existing cross-modal methods designed for ground-level views in
effectively modeling their characteristics. Therefore, dedicated retrieval
mechanisms tailored for drone scenarios are necessary. To address this issue,
we propose a novel approach called Multi-Semantic Adaptive Mining (MSAM). MSAM
introduces a multi-semantic adaptive learning mechanism, which incorporates
dynamic changes between frames and extracts rich semantic information from
specific scene regions, thereby enhancing the deep understanding and reasoning
of drone video content. This method relies on fine-grained interactions between
words and drone video frames, integrating an adaptive semantic construction
module, a distribution-driven semantic learning term and a diversity semantic
term to deepen the interaction between text and drone video modalities and
improve the robustness of feature representation. To reduce the interference of
complex backgrounds in drone videos, we introduce a cross-modal interactive
feature fusion pooling mechanism that focuses on feature extraction and
matching in target regions, minimizing noise effects. Extensive experiments on
two self-constructed drone video-text datasets show that MSAM outperforms other
existing methods in the drone video-text retrieval task. The source code and
dataset will be made publicly available.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出DRIFT方法，通过梯度空间转移推理知识来提升多模态大语言模型的推理能力，避免传统方法的高资源消耗问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型的推理能力通常落后于纯文本模型，而现有的提升方法（监督微调或强化学习）都需要大量资源。模型合并虽然是一种替代方案，但效果在不同模型家族间差异很大。

Method: 提出DRIFT方法：预计算推理先验（推理模型与多模态模型的参数差异），在微调过程中用该先验偏置梯度，从而在不破坏多模态对齐的情况下转移推理知识。

Result: 在MathVista和MathVerse等多模态推理基准测试中，DRIFT相比朴素合并和监督微调能持续提升推理性能，且以较低成本达到或超过资源密集型方法的水平。

Conclusion: DRIFT提供了一种轻量级且有效的解决方案，能够在保持标准监督微调流程简单性的同时，高效转移推理知识，显著提升多模态模型的推理能力。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are rapidly advancing, yet their
reasoning ability often lags behind that of strong text-only counterparts.
Existing methods to bridge this gap rely on supervised fine-tuning over
large-scale multimodal reasoning data or reinforcement learning, both of which
are resource-intensive. A promising alternative is model merging, which
interpolates parameters between reasoning-enhanced LLMs and multimodal
variants. However, our analysis shows that naive merging is not always a "free
lunch": its effectiveness varies drastically across model families, with some
(e.g., LLaVA, Idefics) benefiting while others (e.g., Qwen) suffer performance
degradation. To address this, we propose Directional Reasoning Injection for
Fine-Tuning (DRIFT) MLLMs, a lightweight method that transfers reasoning
knowledge in the gradient space, without destabilizing multimodal alignment.
DRIFT precomputes a reasoning prior as the parameter-space difference between
reasoning and multimodal variants, then uses it to bias gradients during
multimodal fine-tuning. This approach preserves the simplicity of standard
supervised fine-tuning pipelines while enabling efficient reasoning transfer.
Extensive experiments on multimodal reasoning benchmarks, including MathVista
and MathVerse, demonstrate that DRIFT consistently improves reasoning
performance over naive merging and supervised fine-tuning, while matching or
surpassing training-heavy methods at a fraction of the cost.

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Young children readily recognize and generalize visual objects labeled by
common nouns, suggesting that these basic level object categories may be given.
Yet if they are, how they arise remains unclear. We propose that the answer
lies in the statistics of infant daily life visual experiences. Whereas large
and diverse datasets typically support robust learning and generalization in
human and machine learning, infants achieve this generalization from limited
experiences. We suggest that the resolution of this apparent contradiction lies
in the visual diversity of daily life, repeated experiences with single object
instances. Analyzing egocentric images from 14 infants (aged 7 to 11 months) we
show that their everyday visual input exhibits a lumpy similarity structure,
with clusters of highly similar images interspersed with rarer, more variable
ones, across eight early-learned categories. Computational experiments show
that mimicking this structure in machines improves generalization from small
datasets in machine learning. The natural lumpiness of infant experience may
thus support early category learning and generalization and, more broadly,
offer principles for efficient learning across a variety of problems and kinds
of learners.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SaLon3R是一个结构感知的长期3D高斯泼溅重建框架，通过引入紧凑锚点基元和3D点变换器，解决了长视频序列中的冗余和几何不一致问题，实现了超过50%的冗余消除和实时重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D高斯泼溅方法在长视频序列中会产生大量冗余和几何不一致，需要一种能够在线重建、消除冗余并保持几何一致性的方法。

Method: 使用3D重建骨干网络预测密集像素级高斯和显著性图，通过可微分显著性感知高斯量化将冗余高斯压缩为紧凑锚点，利用3D点变换器学习空间结构先验来精炼锚点属性和显著性。

Result: 在多个数据集上实现了最先进的性能，能够重建超过50个视图，帧率超过10FPS，冗余消除率达到50%到90%，在新型视图合成和深度估计方面表现出色。

Conclusion: SaLon3R无需已知相机参数或测试时优化，在单次前向传播中有效解决伪影并修剪冗余3DGS，展示了在长期通用3D重建方面的卓越效率、鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have enabled generalizable,
on-the-fly reconstruction of sequential input views. However, existing methods
often predict per-pixel Gaussians and combine Gaussians from all views as the
scene representation, leading to substantial redundancies and geometric
inconsistencies in long-duration video sequences. To address this, we propose
SaLon3R, a novel framework for Structure-aware, Long-term 3DGS Reconstruction.
To our best knowledge, SaLon3R is the first online generalizable GS method
capable of reconstructing over 50 views in over 10 FPS, with 50% to 90%
redundancy removal. Our method introduces compact anchor primitives to
eliminate redundancy through differentiable saliency-aware Gaussian
quantization, coupled with a 3D Point Transformer that refines anchor
attributes and saliency to resolve cross-frame geometric and photometric
inconsistencies. Specifically, we first leverage a 3D reconstruction backbone
to predict dense per-pixel Gaussians and a saliency map encoding regional
geometric complexity. Redundant Gaussians are compressed into compact anchors
by prioritizing high-complexity regions. The 3D Point Transformer then learns
spatial structural priors in 3D space from training data to refine anchor
attributes and saliency, enabling regionally adaptive Gaussian decoding for
geometric fidelity. Without known camera parameters or test-time optimization,
our approach effectively resolves artifacts and prunes the redundant 3DGS in a
single feed-forward pass. Experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate our
state-of-the-art performance on both novel view synthesis and depth estimation,
demonstrating superior efficiency, robustness, and generalization ability for
long-term generalizable 3D reconstruction. Project Page:

TL;DR: TGT框架通过结合文本描述和轨迹点来控制视频生成，使用位置感知交叉注意力和双CFG方案，在复杂多对象场景中实现更精确的外观和运动控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到视频生成方法在控制场景中多个对象的精确位置和运动轨迹方面存在局限，特别是在复杂多对象设置下表现不佳。

Method: 提出文本引导轨迹(TGT)框架，使用轨迹点配合局部文本描述；开发位置感知交叉注意力(LACA)来整合这些信号；采用双CFG方案分别调节局部和全局文本引导；构建数据处理流程生成带跟踪实体描述的轨迹。

Result: TGT在视觉质量、文本对齐准确性和运动可控性方面均优于现有方法，能够更精确地控制多个对象的外观和运动。

Conclusion: TGT框架通过文本引导轨迹实现了对视频生成中多个对象的精确控制，在复杂场景中表现出优越的性能。

Abstract: Text-to-video generation has advanced rapidly in visual fidelity, whereas
standard methods still have limited ability to control the subject composition
of generated scenes. Prior work shows that adding localized text control
signals, such as bounding boxes or segmentation masks, can help. However, these
methods struggle in complex scenarios and degrade in multi-object settings,
offering limited precision and lacking a clear correspondence between
individual trajectories and visual entities as the number of controllable
objects increases. We introduce Text-Grounded Trajectories (TGT), a framework
that conditions video generation on trajectories paired with localized text
descriptions. We propose Location-Aware Cross-Attention (LACA) to integrate
these signals and adopt a dual-CFG scheme to separately modulate local and
global text guidance. In addition, we develop a data processing pipeline that
produces trajectories with localized descriptions of tracked entities, and we
annotate two million high quality video clips to train TGT. Together, these
components enable TGT to use point trajectories as intuitive motion handles,
pairing each trajectory with text to control both appearance and motion.
Extensive experiments show that TGT achieves higher visual quality, more
accurate text alignment, and improved motion controllability compared with
prior approaches. Website: https://textgroundedtraj.github.io.

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently emerged as powerful generative models in
medical imaging. However, it remains a major challenge to combine these
data-driven models with domain knowledge to guide brain imaging problems. In
neuroimaging, Bayesian inverse problems have long provided a successful
framework for inference tasks, where incorporating domain knowledge of the
imaging process enables robust performance without requiring extensive training
data. However, the anatomical modeling component of these approaches typically
relies on classical mathematical priors that often fail to capture the complex
structure of brain anatomy. In this work, we present the first general-purpose
application of diffusion models as priors for solving a wide range of medical
imaging inverse problems. Our approach leverages a score-based diffusion prior
trained extensively on diverse brain MRI data, paired with flexible forward
models that capture common image processing tasks such as super-resolution,
bias field correction, inpainting, and combinations thereof. We further
demonstrate how our framework can refine outputs from existing deep learning
methods to improve anatomical fidelity. Experiments on heterogeneous clinical
and research MRI data show that our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance producing consistent, high-quality solutions without requiring
paired training datasets. These results highlight the potential of diffusion
priors as versatile tools for brain MRI analysis.

TL;DR: 提出了FFT-MIL框架，通过傅里叶变换在频域提取全局上下文信息，与空间补丁特征融合，提升全切片图像分类性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MIL方法难以捕捉全切片图像的全局依赖关系，限制了粗粒度结构的建模能力

Method: 使用快速傅里叶变换提取低频分量，通过FFT-Block处理频域数据，并与空间补丁特征融合

Result: 在6种先进MIL方法和3个公开数据集上测试，平均提升宏F1分数3.51%，AUC提升1.51%

Conclusion: 频域学习是捕捉WSI分类中全局依赖关系的有效机制，能补充空间特征并提升MIL方法的可扩展性和准确性

Abstract: Whole Slide Image (WSI) classification relies on Multiple Instance Learning
(MIL) with spatial patch features, yet existing methods struggle to capture
global dependencies due to the immense size of WSIs and the local nature of
patch embeddings. This limitation hinders the modeling of coarse structures
essential for robust diagnostic prediction.
  We propose Fourier Transform Multiple Instance Learning (FFT-MIL), a
framework that augments MIL with a frequency-domain branch to provide compact
global context. Low-frequency crops are extracted from WSIs via the Fast
Fourier Transform and processed through a modular FFT-Block composed of
convolutional layers and Min-Max normalization to mitigate the high variance of
frequency data. The learned global frequency feature is fused with spatial
patch features through lightweight integration strategies, enabling
compatibility with diverse MIL architectures.
  FFT-MIL was evaluated across six state-of-the-art MIL methods on three public
datasets (BRACS, LUAD, and IMP). Integration of the FFT-Block improved macro F1
scores by an average of 3.51% and AUC by 1.51%, demonstrating consistent gains
across architectures and datasets. These results establish frequency-domain
learning as an effective and efficient mechanism for capturing global
dependencies in WSI classification, complementing spatial features and
advancing the scalability and accuracy of MIL-based computational pathology.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准主要评估一般跨模态问答能力，但无法确定全模态大语言模型是否真正实现了模态不变推理或存在模态特定偏见。

Method: 构建包含60,828个多选题的大规模三模态基准XModBench，涵盖五个任务家族和所有六种模态组合，能够细粒度诊断模态不变推理、模态差异和方向不平衡。

Result: 实验显示最强模型Gemini 2.5 Pro在空间时间推理准确率低于60%，存在持续模态差异（音频表现显著低于文本），以及系统性的方向不平衡（视觉作为上下文时一致性更低）。

Conclusion: 当前全模态大语言模型远未实现真正的模态不变推理，XModBench可作为评估和改进跨模态能力的基本诊断工具。

Abstract: Omni-modal large language models (OLLMs) aim to unify audio, vision, and text
understanding within a single framework. While existing benchmarks primarily
evaluate general cross-modal question-answering ability, it remains unclear
whether OLLMs achieve modality-invariant reasoning or exhibit modality-specific
biases. We introduce XModBench, a large-scale tri-modal benchmark explicitly
designed to measure cross-modal consistency. XModBench comprises 60,828
multiple-choice questions spanning five task families and systematically covers
all six modality compositions in question-answer pairs, enabling fine-grained
diagnosis of an OLLM's modality-invariant reasoning, modality disparity, and
directional imbalance. Experiments show that even the strongest model, Gemini
2.5 Pro, (i) struggles with spatial and temporal reasoning, achieving less than
60% accuracy, (ii) reveals persistent modality disparities, with performance
dropping substantially when the same semantic content is conveyed through audio
rather than text, and (iii) shows systematic directional imbalance, exhibiting
lower consistency when vision serves as context compared to text. These
findings indicate that current OLLMs remain far from truly modality-invariant
reasoning and position XModBench as a fundamental diagnostic tool for
evaluating and improving cross-modal competence. All data and evaluation tools
will be available at https://xingruiwang.github.io/projects/XModBench/.

Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在图像-文本描述数据和交错文档数据上持续预训练，但对高质量图像-文本交错文档数据的筛选研究不足。

Method: 采用半合成方法，利用原始图像生成不同质量级别的文本，创建样本-分数对来训练UniFilter分类器，然后应用于DataComp和OBELICS数据集的筛选。

Result: 在筛选数据上预训练的MLLM展现出显著增强的零样本推理和上下文学习能力，经过视觉监督微调后在多个基准测试中表现更优。

Conclusion: UniFilter有效提升了多模态预训练数据的质量，为社区提供了合成训练数据、模型检查点和高质量OBELICS-HQ子集，促进进一步研究。

Abstract: The Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are continually pre-trained on a
mixture of image-text caption data and interleaved document data, while the
high-quality data filtering towards image-text interleaved document data is
under-explored. We propose to train an efficient MLLM as a Unified Mulitmodal
Data Quality Classifier to Filter both high-quality image-text caption and
interleaved data (UniFilter). To address the challenge of collecting diverse
labeled multimodal data, we introduce a semi-synthetic approach that leverages
readily available raw images and generates corresponding text across four
quality levels. This method enables efficient creation of sample-score pairs
for both caption and interleaved document data to train UniFilter. We apply
UniFilter to curate high-quality caption data from DataComp caption dataset and
interleaved data from the OBELICS image-text interleaved dataset. MLLMs
pre-trained on the filtered data demonstrate significantly enhanced
capabilities compared to those trained on baseline-filtered data, achieving
stronger zero-shot reasoning and in-context learning capabilities. After visual
supervised fine-tuning, these UniFilter-induced MLLMs achieve stronger
performance on various benchmarks, highlighting the downstream benefits of
high-quality multimodal pre-training. We release the synthetic training data
used for training UniFilter, the UniFilter model checkpoints, and the
high-quality interleaved document subset OBELICS-HQ, curated by UniFilter, to
the community for reproduction and further development.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了组织病理学基础模型训练中的可重复性问题，通过在QUILT-1M数据集上训练CLIP模型，系统评估了不同超参数设置和数据增强策略对三个下游数据集的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 组织病理学基础模型训练面临可重复性挑战，主要受软件随机性、硬件非确定性和超参数报告不一致等因素影响，需要系统研究这些问题。

Method: 在QUILT-1M数据集上训练CLIP模型，系统评估不同超参数设置（如RandomResizedCrop值、学习率）和数据增强策略，并在三个下游组织病理学数据集（PatchCamelyon、LC25000-Lung、LC25000-Colon）上进行测试。

Result: 发现RandomResizedCrop值在0.7-0.8时表现最佳，分布式训练不使用局部损失可提高稳定性，学习率低于5.0e-5会降低性能，LC25000（Colon）数据集提供了最可重复的基准。

Conclusion: 计算病理学的可重复性不仅依赖于透明文档，还需要精心选择的实验配置，论文提供了实用规则来指导未来开发可重复的数字病理学基础模型。

Abstract: Reproducibility remains a critical challenge in foundation model training for
histopathology, often hindered by software randomness, hardware
non-determinism, and inconsistent hyperparameter reporting. To investigate
these issues, we trained a CLIP model on the QUILT-1M dataset and
systematically evaluated the impact of different hyperparameter settings and
augmentation strategies across three downstream histopathology datasets
(PatchCamelyon, LC25000-Lung, and LC25000-Colon). Despite variability across
runs, we identified clear trends: RandomResizedCrop values of 0.7-0.8
outperformed more aggressive (0.6) or conservative (0.9) settings, distributed
training without local loss improved stability, and learning rates below 5.0e-5
consistently degraded performance across all datasets. The LC25000 (Colon)
dataset consistently provided the most reproducible benchmark. These findings
highlight that reproducibility in computational pathology depends not only on
transparent documentation but also on carefully chosen experimental
configurations, and we provide practical rules to guide future efforts in
developing reproducible foundation models for digital pathology.

Motivation: 现有生成数据增强方法难以在保真度和多样性之间取得平衡，因为合成过程中的表示往往与非必要的输入图像属性（如环境上下文）纠缠，与修改这些元素的文本提示产生冲突。

Method: 使用显著概念感知图像嵌入模型来减少合成过程中不相关视觉细节的影响，保持图像和文本输入之间的直观对齐，生成更好地保留类别区分特征并具有额外受控变化的图像。

Result: 在八个细粒度视觉数据集上表现出色，在常规和长尾设置下分别比最先进的数据增强方法平均分类准确率提高0.73%和6.5%。

Conclusion: 该框架通过生成保留类别区分特征并具有受控变化的图像，有效增强训练数据集的多样性，从而提高下游模型的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Recent generative data augmentation methods conditioned on both image and
text prompts struggle to balance between fidelity and diversity, as it is
challenging to preserve essential image details while aligning with varied text
prompts. This challenge arises because representations in the synthesis process
often become entangled with non-essential input image attributes such as
environmental contexts, creating conflicts with text prompts intended to modify
these elements. To address this, we propose a personalized image generation
framework that uses a salient concept-aware image embedding model to reduce the
influence of irrelevant visual details during the synthesis process, thereby
maintaining intuitive alignment between image and text inputs. By generating
images that better preserve class-discriminative features with additional
controlled variations, our framework effectively enhances the diversity of
training datasets and thereby improves the robustness of downstream models. Our
approach demonstrates superior performance across eight fine-grained vision
datasets, outperforming state-of-the-art augmentation methods with averaged
classification accuracy improvements by 0.73% and 6.5% under conventional and
long-tail settings, respectively.

Abstract: Prenatal diagnosis of Congenital Heart Diseases (CHDs) holds great potential
for Artificial Intelligence (AI)-driven solutions. However, collecting
high-quality diagnostic data remains difficult due to the rarity of these
conditions, resulting in imbalanced and low-quality datasets that hinder model
performance. Moreover, no public efforts have been made to integrate multiple
sources of information, such as imaging and clinical data, further limiting the
ability of AI models to support and enhance clinical decision-making. To
overcome these challenges, we introduce the Congenital Anomaly Recognition with
Diagnostic Images and Unified Medical records (CARDIUM) dataset, the first
publicly available multimodal dataset consolidating fetal ultrasound and
echocardiographic images along with maternal clinical records for prenatal CHD
detection. Furthermore, we propose a robust multimodal transformer architecture
that incorporates a cross-attention mechanism to fuse feature representations
from image and tabular data, improving CHD detection by 11% and 50% over image
and tabular single-modality approaches, respectively, and achieving an F1 score
of 79.8 $\pm$ 4.8% in the CARDIUM dataset. We will publicly release our dataset

Abstract: We present DriveGen3D, a novel framework for generating high-quality and
highly controllable dynamic 3D driving scenes that addresses critical
limitations in existing methodologies. Current approaches to driving scene
synthesis either suffer from prohibitive computational demands for extended
temporal generation, focus exclusively on prolonged video synthesis without 3D
representation, or restrict themselves to static single-scene reconstruction.
Our work bridges this methodological gap by integrating accelerated long-term
video generation with large-scale dynamic scene reconstruction through
multimodal conditional control. DriveGen3D introduces a unified pipeline
consisting of two specialized components: FastDrive-DiT, an efficient video
diffusion transformer for high-resolution, temporally coherent video synthesis
under text and Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) layout guidance; and FastRecon3D, a
feed-forward reconstruction module that rapidly builds 3D Gaussian
representations across time, ensuring spatial-temporal consistency. Together,
these components enable real-time generation of extended driving videos (up to
$424\times800$ at 12 FPS) and corresponding dynamic 3D scenes, achieving SSIM
of 0.811 and PSNR of 22.84 on novel view synthesis, all while maintaining

Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is the primary imaging modality used in the
diagnosis, assessment, and treatment planning for brain pathologies. However,
most automated MRI analysis tools, such as segmentation and registration
pipelines, are optimized for healthy anatomies and often fail when confronted
with large lesions such as tumors. To overcome this, image inpainting
techniques aim to locally synthesize healthy brain tissues in tumor regions,
enabling the reliable application of general-purpose tools. In this work, we
systematically evaluate state-of-the-art inpainting models and observe a
saturation in their standalone performance. In response, we introduce a
methodology combining model ensembling with efficient post-processing
strategies such as median filtering, histogram matching, and pixel averaging.
Further anatomical refinement is achieved via a lightweight U-Net enhancement
stage. Comprehensive evaluation demonstrates that our proposed pipeline
improves the anatomical plausibility and visual fidelity of inpainted regions,

TL;DR: 提出QCFace方法，通过硬边界策略解决人脸识别中可识别性与身份特征纠缠的问题，实现更好的特征表示和性能提升


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前人脸识别系统在可识别性表示方面存在不足，软边界约束仅部分捕捉可识别性，且特征方向与幅度的梯度重叠导致优化不稳定和表示纠缠

Method: 引入硬边界策略QCFace，采用基于硬边界的损失函数，包含超球面规划的引导因子，同时优化识别能力和显式可识别性表示

Result: 实验证明QCFace能提供鲁棒且可量化的可识别性编码，在验证和识别基准测试中达到最先进性能

Conclusion: QCFace成功解决了梯度重叠问题，实现了可识别性与身份表示的清晰解耦，提升了人脸识别系统的性能

Abstract: Recognizability, a key perceptual factor in human face processing, strongly
affects the performance of face recognition (FR) systems in both verification
and identification tasks. Effectively using recognizability to enhance feature
representation remains challenging. In deep FR, the loss function plays a
crucial role in shaping how features are embedded. However, current methods
have two main drawbacks: (i) recognizability is only partially captured through
soft margin constraints, resulting in weaker quality representation and lower
discrimination, especially for low-quality or ambiguous faces; (ii) mutual
overlapping gradients between feature direction and magnitude introduce
undesirable interactions during optimization, causing instability and confusion
in hypersphere planning, which may result in poor generalization, and entangled
representations where recognizability and identity are not cleanly separated.
To address these issues, we introduce a hard margin strategy - Quality Control
Face (QCFace), which overcomes the mutual overlapping gradient problem and
enables the clear decoupling of recognizability from identity representation.
Based on this strategy, a novel hard-margin-based loss function employs a
guidance factor for hypersphere planning, simultaneously optimizing for
recognition ability and explicit recognizability representation. Extensive
experiments confirm that QCFace not only provides robust and quantifiable
recognizability encoding but also achieves state-of-the-art performance in both
verification and identification benchmarks compared to existing
recognizability-based losses.

Motivation: 解决单正多标签学习中难以捕捉复杂标签关系和层次结构的问题，现有方法缺乏对不同关系类型的显式几何定义

Method: 使用双曲球表示标签，通过球体交互建模包含、重叠和分离关系；引入温度自适应双曲球分类器和物理启发的双势阱正则化

Result: 在四个基准数据集上的实验显示具有竞争力的性能，统计分析表明学习到的嵌入与实际共现模式强相关

Conclusion: 双曲几何为不完全监督下的结构化分类提供了更鲁棒的范式，具有优越的可解释性

Abstract: Single Positive Multi-Label Learning (SPMLL) addresses the challenging
scenario where each training sample is annotated with only one positive label
despite potentially belonging to multiple categories, making it difficult to
capture complex label relationships and hierarchical structures. While existing
methods implicitly model label relationships through distance-based similarity,
lacking explicit geometric definitions for different relationship types. To
address these limitations, we propose the first hyperbolic classification
framework for SPMLL that represents each label as a hyperbolic ball rather than
a point or vector, enabling rich inter-label relationship modeling through
geometric ball interactions. Our ball-based approach naturally captures
multiple relationship types simultaneously: inclusion for hierarchical
structures, overlap for co-occurrence patterns, and separation for semantic
independence. Further, we introduce two key component innovations: a
temperature-adaptive hyperbolic ball classifier and a physics-inspired
double-well regularization that guides balls toward meaningful configurations.
To validate our approach, extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets
(MS-COCO, PASCAL VOC, NUS-WIDE, CUB-200-2011) demonstrate competitive
performance with superior interpretability compared to existing methods.
Furthermore, statistical analysis reveals strong correlation between learned
embeddings and real-world co-occurrence patterns, establishing hyperbolic
geometry as a more robust paradigm for structured classification under
incomplete supervision.

TL;DR: SVG是一种新型的潜在扩散模型，不使用变分自编码器，而是利用自监督表示进行视觉生成，通过DINO特征构建具有清晰语义区分度的特征空间，实现更高效的扩散训练和生成质量提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的VAE+扩散范式存在训练效率低、推理速度慢、对其他视觉任务迁移性差的问题，主要原因是VAE潜在空间缺乏清晰的语义分离和强判别结构。

Method: SVG利用冻结的DINO特征构建语义结构化的潜在空间，同时使用轻量级残差分支捕获细粒度细节以实现高保真重建，直接在语义结构化的潜在空间上训练扩散模型。

Result: SVG实现了加速扩散训练、支持少步采样、提高生成质量，同时保留了底层自监督表示的语义和判别能力。

Conclusion: SVG为任务通用、高质量的视觉表示提供了一条原则性途径，解决了传统VAE+扩散范式的局限性。

Abstract: Recent progress in diffusion-based visual generation has largely relied on
latent diffusion models with variational autoencoders (VAEs). While effective
for high-fidelity synthesis, this VAE+diffusion paradigm suffers from limited
training efficiency, slow inference, and poor transferability to broader vision
tasks. These issues stem from a key limitation of VAE latent spaces: the lack
of clear semantic separation and strong discriminative structure. Our analysis
confirms that these properties are crucial not only for perception and
understanding tasks, but also for the stable and efficient training of latent
diffusion models. Motivated by this insight, we introduce SVG, a novel latent
diffusion model without variational autoencoders, which leverages
self-supervised representations for visual generation. SVG constructs a feature
space with clear semantic discriminability by leveraging frozen DINO features,
while a lightweight residual branch captures fine-grained details for
high-fidelity reconstruction. Diffusion models are trained directly on this
semantically structured latent space to facilitate more efficient learning. As
a result, SVG enables accelerated diffusion training, supports few-step
sampling, and improves generative quality. Experimental results further show
that SVG preserves the semantic and discriminative capabilities of the
underlying self-supervised representations, providing a principled pathway
toward task-general, high-quality visual representations.

Motivation: 大语言模型虽然性能优秀但计算和存储需求巨大。现有结构化剪枝方法直接移除层会导致性能显著下降，且缺乏有效的后训练恢复机制。

Method: 提出通道敏感度指标进行细粒度通道选择，使用基于拼接的层合并方法融合相邻层的关键通道，采用分层蒸馏协议实现知识迁移。

Result: 在7个基准测试中达到最先进性能，剪枝LLaMA-2-7b模型30%参数后仍能保持83%的原始平均准确率。

Conclusion: CoMe框架通过渐进式剪枝和分层蒸馏，在显著减少模型参数的同时有效保持了模型性能，解决了传统剪枝方法的局限性。

Abstract: Large Language Models excel at natural language processing tasks, but their
massive size leads to high computational and storage demands. Recent works have
sought to reduce their model size through layer-wise structured pruning.
However, they tend to ignore retaining the capabilities in the pruned part. In
this work, we re-examine structured pruning paradigms and uncover several key
limitations: 1) notable performance degradation due to direct layer removal, 2)
incompetent linear weight layer aggregation, and 3) the lack of effective
post-training recovery mechanisms. To address these limitations, we propose
CoMe, including a progressive layer pruning framework with a
Concatenation-based Merging technology and a hierarchical distillation
post-training process. Specifically, we introduce a channel sensitivity metric
that utilizes activation intensity and weight norms for fine-grained channel
selection. Subsequently, we employ a concatenation-based layer merging method
to fuse the most critical channels across adjacent layers, enabling progressive
model size reduction. Finally, we propose a hierarchical distillation protocol
that leverages the correspondences between the original and pruned model layers
established during pruning, thereby enabling efficient knowledge transfer.
Experiments on seven benchmarks show that CoMe achieves state-of-the-art
performance; when pruning 30% of LLaMA-2-7b's parameters, the pruned model
retains 83% of its original average accuracy. Our code is available at

Motivation: 现有基准主要关注2D空间理解，缺乏全面评估6D空间推理能力的框架，需要开发新的评估方法来测试模型在复杂3D空间推理方面的表现。

Method: 创建了Spatial457合成数据集，包含4个关键能力：多目标识别、2D位置、3D位置和3D方向，采用级联评估结构构建了7种问题类型和5个难度级别。

Result: 评估发现大型多模态模型在任务复杂度增加时性能普遍下降，特别是在3D推理和6D空间任务上，并引入了相对性能下降率来量化这些挑战。

Conclusion: 揭示了大型多模态模型在3D空间推理方面的关键弱点，并发现了跨不同属性的预测偏差，这些模式在真实世界图像设置中也类似存在。

Abstract: Although large multimodal models (LMMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in visual scene interpretation and reasoning, their capacity for
complex and precise 3-dimensional spatial reasoning remains uncertain. Existing
benchmarks focus predominantly on 2D spatial understanding and lack a framework
to comprehensively evaluate 6D spatial reasoning across varying complexities.
To address this limitation, we present Spatial457, a scalable and unbiased
synthetic dataset designed with 4 key capability for spatial reasoning:
multi-object recognition, 2D location, 3D location, and 3D orientation. We
develop a cascading evaluation structure, constructing 7 question types across
5 difficulty levels that range from basic single object recognition to our new
proposed complex 6D spatial reasoning tasks. We evaluated various large
multimodal models (LMMs) on PulseCheck457, observing a general decline in
performance as task complexity increases, particularly in 3D reasoning and 6D
spatial tasks. To quantify these challenges, we introduce the Relative
Performance Dropping Rate (RPDR), highlighting key weaknesses in 3D reasoning
capabilities. Leveraging the unbiased attribute design of our dataset, we also
uncover prediction biases across different attributes, with similar patterns
observed in real-world image settings. The code and data are released in

Conclusion: Proto-Former通过原型学习实现了统一的面部关键点检测，解决了多数据集联合训练的挑战，提升了模型泛化能力。

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have significantly improved facial landmark
detection. However, existing facial landmark detection datasets often define
different numbers of landmarks, and most mainstream methods can only be trained
on a single dataset. This limits the model generalization to different datasets
and hinders the development of a unified model. To address this issue, we
propose Proto-Former, a unified, adaptive, end-to-end facial landmark detection
framework that explicitly enhances dataset-specific facial structural
representations (i.e., prototype). Proto-Former overcomes the limitations of
single-dataset training by enabling joint training across multiple datasets
within a unified architecture. Specifically, Proto-Former comprises two key
components: an Adaptive Prototype-Aware Encoder (APAE) that performs adaptive
feature extraction and learns prototype representations, and a Progressive
Prototype-Aware Decoder (PPAD) that refines these prototypes to generate
prompts that guide the model's attention to key facial regions. Furthermore, we
introduce a novel Prototype-Aware (PA) loss, which achieves optimal path
finding by constraining the selection weights of prototype experts. This loss
function effectively resolves the problem of prototype expert addressing
instability during multi-dataset training, alleviates gradient conflicts, and
enables the extraction of more accurate facial structure features. Extensive
experiments on widely used benchmark datasets demonstrate that our Proto-Former
achieves superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art methods.

Method: SHARE首先估计每帧的人体网格和分割掩码，以及关键帧的场景点云图。通过迭代比较人体网格与使用掩码从场景中提取的人体点云图来优化关键帧中的人体位置，并在优化过程中保持非关键帧人体网格相对于关键帧根关节位置的一致性

Conclusion: SHARE通过利用场景几何的空间线索，实现了更准确的人体3D定位，同时重建周围场景，为各种应用场景提供了有效的解决方案

Abstract: Animating realistic character interactions with the surrounding environment
is important for autonomous agents in gaming, AR/VR, and robotics. However,
current methods for human motion reconstruction struggle with accurately
placing humans in 3D space. We introduce Scene-Human Aligned REconstruction
(SHARE), a technique that leverages the scene geometry's inherent spatial cues
to accurately ground human motion reconstruction. Each reconstruction relies
solely on a monocular RGB video from a stationary camera. SHARE first estimates
a human mesh and segmentation mask for every frame, alongside a scene point map
at keyframes. It iteratively refines the human's positions at these keyframes
by comparing the human mesh against the human point map extracted from the
scene using the mask. Crucially, we also ensure that non-keyframe human meshes
remain consistent by preserving their relative root joint positions to keyframe
root joints during optimization. Our approach enables more accurate 3D human
placement while reconstructing the surrounding scene, facilitating use cases on
both curated datasets and in-the-wild web videos. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that SHARE outperforms existing methods.

Motivation: EEG和ECoG信号在运动想象分类中具有重要应用价值，但易受生理伪影干扰，且现有Transformer方法难以捕捉细粒度依赖关系。

Method: 提出Cortical-SSM架构，扩展深度状态空间模型，整合捕捉EEG和ECoG信号在时间、空间和频率三个维度的依赖关系。

Result: 在三个基准测试中表现优异：两个大规模公共MI EEG数据集（超过50名受试者）和一个临床MI ECoG数据集（来自ALS患者），均优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅能有效分类EEG和ECoG信号，还能捕捉神经生理学相关区域，为运动障碍患者的通信辅助和康复支持提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Classification of electroencephalogram (EEG) and electrocorticogram (ECoG)
signals obtained during motor imagery (MI) has substantial application
potential, including for communication assistance and rehabilitation support
for patients with motor impairments. These signals remain inherently
susceptible to physiological artifacts (e.g., eye blinking, swallowing), which
pose persistent challenges. Although Transformer-based approaches for
classifying EEG and ECoG signals have been widely adopted, they often struggle
to capture fine-grained dependencies within them. To overcome these
limitations, we propose Cortical-SSM, a novel architecture that extends deep
state space models to capture integrated dependencies of EEG and ECoG signals
across temporal, spatial, and frequency domains. We validated our method across
three benchmarks: 1) two large-scale public MI EEG datasets containing more
than 50 subjects, and 2) a clinical MI ECoG dataset recorded from a patient
with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Our method outperformed baseline methods on
the three benchmarks. Furthermore, visual explanations derived from our model
indicate that it effectively captures neurophysiologically relevant regions of
both EEG and ECoG signals.

Motivation: 微创手术中的自动化工具检测具有重要意义，但手术场景中标注数据有限，训练鲁棒的深度学习模型面临挑战。

Method: 两阶段自适应微调：1) 线性探测阶段，在预训练CNN架构上调节额外分类层；2) 渐进冻结阶段，动态减少可微调层数，调控对手术领域的适应。

Result: 在Cholec80数据集上验证，使用ResNet-50和DenseNet-121架构，相比现有方法和标准微调技术，检测性能显著提升，mAP达到96.4%。在CATARACTS眼科手术数据集上进一步验证了泛化能力。

Conclusion: 渐进冻结微调是提升多样化手术过程中工具存在检测的有前景技术，在通用图像分类任务中具有更广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Minimally invasive surgery can benefit significantly from automated surgical
tool detection, enabling advanced analysis and assistance. However, the limited
availability of annotated data in surgical settings poses a challenge for
training robust deep learning models. This paper introduces a novel staged
adaptive fine-tuning approach consisting of two steps: a linear probing stage
to condition additional classification layers on a pre-trained CNN-based
architecture and a gradual freezing stage to dynamically reduce the
fine-tunable layers, aiming to regulate adaptation to the surgical domain. This
strategy reduces network complexity and improves efficiency, requiring only a
single training loop and eliminating the need for multiple iterations. We
validated our method on the Cholec80 dataset, employing CNN architectures
(ResNet-50 and DenseNet-121) pre-trained on ImageNet for detecting surgical
tools in cholecystectomy endoscopic videos. Our results demonstrate that our
method improves detection performance compared to existing approaches and
established fine-tuning techniques, achieving a mean average precision (mAP) of
96.4%. To assess its broader applicability, the generalizability of the
fine-tuning strategy was further confirmed on the CATARACTS dataset, a distinct
domain of minimally invasive ophthalmic surgery. These findings suggest that
gradual freezing fine-tuning is a promising technique for improving tool
presence detection in diverse surgical procedures and may have broader
applications in general image classification tasks.

TL;DR: 提出FreqPDE方法，通过频率感知的空间金字塔编码器、跨视图尺度不变深度预测器和位置深度编码器，为2D图像特征添加空间信息，用于3D检测transformer解码器，无需LiDAR监督即可实现多视角3D目标检测。

Motivation: 当前基于多视角2D图像的3D检测方法依赖深度预测来恢复空间信息，需要LiDAR点云监督，但预测深度质量不佳，存在物体边界深度不连续和小物体难以区分的问题，且忽视了跨视图一致性和尺度不变性。

Method: 使用频率感知空间金字塔编码器(FSPE)结合高频边缘线索和低频语义构建特征金字塔；跨视图尺度不变深度预测器(CSDP)估计像素级深度分布；位置深度编码器(PDE)结合2D图像特征和3D位置嵌入生成深度感知特征；采用混合深度监督从度量和分布角度进行互补学习。

Result: 在nuScenes数据集上的大量实验证明了该方法的有效性和优越性。

Conclusion: FreqPDE方法能够有效解决多视角3D检测中的深度预测质量问题，无需LiDAR监督即可实现准确的3D目标检测。

Abstract: Detecting 3D objects accurately from multi-view 2D images is a challenging
yet essential task in the field of autonomous driving. Current methods resort
to integrating depth prediction to recover the spatial information for object
query decoding, which necessitates explicit supervision from LiDAR points
during the training phase. However, the predicted depth quality is still
unsatisfactory such as depth discontinuity of object boundaries and
indistinction of small objects, which are mainly caused by the sparse
supervision of projected points and the use of high-level image features for
depth prediction. Besides, cross-view consistency and scale invariance are also
overlooked in previous methods. In this paper, we introduce Frequency-aware
Positional Depth Embedding (FreqPDE) to equip 2D image features with spatial
information for 3D detection transformer decoder, which can be obtained through
three main modules. Specifically, the Frequency-aware Spatial Pyramid Encoder
(FSPE) constructs a feature pyramid by combining high-frequency edge clues and
low-frequency semantics from different levels respectively. Then the Cross-view
Scale-invariant Depth Predictor (CSDP) estimates the pixel-level depth
distribution with cross-view and efficient channel attention mechanism.
Finally, the Positional Depth Encoder (PDE) combines the 2D image features and
3D position embeddings to generate the 3D depth-aware features for query
decoding. Additionally, hybrid depth supervision is adopted for complementary
depth learning from both metric and distribution aspects. Extensive experiments
conducted on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority
of our proposed method.

Motivation: 现有3DGS方法假设物体在单一静态姿态下捕获，导致重建不完整，无法处理遮挡或自遮挡区域。

Method: 结合全局和局部配准的融合策略，利用背景特征进行单姿态相机姿态估计，使用基础模型进行跨姿态配准。

Result: PFGS在定性和定量评估中均优于强基线方法，产生更完整的重建和更高保真度的3DGS模型。

Conclusion: PFGS通过智能整合基础模型解决了多姿态重建的挑战，实现了更完整和高质量的3D重建。

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have enabled high-quality,
real-time novel-view synthesis from multi-view images. However, most existing
methods assume the object is captured in a single, static pose, resulting in
incomplete reconstructions that miss occluded or self-occluded regions. We
introduce PFGS, a pose-aware 3DGS framework that addresses the practical
challenge of reconstructing complete objects from multi-pose image captures.
Given images of an object in one main pose and several auxiliary poses, PFGS
iteratively fuses each auxiliary set into a unified 3DGS representation of the
main pose. Our pose-aware fusion strategy combines global and local
registration to merge views effectively and refine the 3DGS model. While recent
advances in 3D foundation models have improved registration robustness and
efficiency, they remain limited by high memory demands and suboptimal accuracy.
PFGS overcomes these challenges by incorporating them more intelligently into
the registration process: it leverages background features for per-pose camera
pose estimation and employs foundation models for cross-pose registration. This
design captures the best of both approaches while resolving background
inconsistency issues. Experimental results demonstrate that PFGS consistently
outperforms strong baselines in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations,
producing more complete reconstructions and higher-fidelity 3DGS models.

Motivation: 现有流式方法在原始运动空间操作导致计算开销大且难以保持时间稳定性，而基于潜在空间的VAE-扩散框架虽然质量高但仅限于离线处理，需要桥接这一差距。

Method: 基于高性能离线框架，采用潜在空间流式架构，结合滑动窗口因果设计和解码运动特征注入，确保平滑运动过渡。

Result: 在基准数据集上实现了风格化质量和响应性之间的良好平衡，能够进行长序列实时任意风格化。

Conclusion: LILAC成功将离线高质量运动风格化扩展到在线设置，为需要连续响应性角色控制的应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Generating long and stylized human motions in real time is critical for
applications that demand continuous and responsive character control. Despite
its importance, existing streaming approaches often operate directly in the raw
motion space, leading to substantial computational overhead and making it
difficult to maintain temporal stability. In contrast, latent-space
VAE-Diffusion-based frameworks alleviate these issues and achieve high-quality
stylization, but they are generally confined to offline processing. To bridge
this gap, LILAC (Long-sequence Incremental Low-latency Arbitrary Motion
Stylization via Streaming VAE-Diffusion with Causal Decoding) builds upon a
recent high-performing offline framework for arbitrary motion stylization and
extends it to an online setting through a latent-space streaming architecture
with a sliding-window causal design and the injection of decoded motion
features to ensure smooth motion transitions. This architecture enables
long-sequence real-time arbitrary stylization without relying on future frames
or modifying the diffusion model architecture, achieving a favorable balance
between stylization quality and responsiveness as demonstrated by experiments
on benchmark datasets. Supplementary video and examples are available at the

Abstract: Most existing underwater instance segmentation approaches are constrained by
close-vocabulary prediction, limiting their ability to recognize novel marine
categories. To support evaluation, we introduce \textbf{MARIS}
(\underline{Mar}ine Open-Vocabulary \underline{I}nstance
\underline{S}egmentation), the first large-scale fine-grained benchmark for
underwater Open-Vocabulary (OV) segmentation, featuring a limited set of seen
categories and diverse unseen categories. Although OV segmentation has shown
promise on natural images, our analysis reveals that transfer to underwater
scenes suffers from severe visual degradation (e.g., color attenuation) and
semantic misalignment caused by lack underwater class definitions. To address
these issues, we propose a unified framework with two complementary components.
The Geometric Prior Enhancement Module (\textbf{GPEM}) leverages stable
part-level and structural cues to maintain object consistency under degraded
visual conditions. The Semantic Alignment Injection Mechanism (\textbf{SAIM})
enriches language embeddings with domain-specific priors, mitigating semantic
ambiguity and improving recognition of unseen categories. Experiments show that
our framework consistently outperforms existing OV baselines both In-Domain and
Cross-Domain setting on MARIS, establishing a strong foundation for future
underwater perception research.

TL;DR: 提出了LoSP-Prompt重建框架，通过物理建模和合成数据驱动的提示学习解决多器官多切片多方向多b值复杂性下的运动伪影问题，实现高分辨率多器官多激发扩散加权成像。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床采用多激发扩散加权磁共振成像进行全身肿瘤诊断受到呼吸、蠕动等运动引起的严重相位伪影限制，同时面临多器官、多切片、多方向和多b值的复杂性挑战。

Method: 将帧间相位变化建模为高阶局部平滑相位，集成到低秩Hankel矩阵重建中，通过仅在模拟生理运动的合成腹部DWI数据上训练的提示学习自动设置算法秩参数。

Result: 在10,000+临床图像验证中：实现了临床单激发DWI两倍的空间分辨率；单一模型泛化到七个解剖区域；在图像质量、伪影抑制和噪声降低方面优于最先进方法，获得放射科医生4-5分评价。

Conclusion: 该方法消除了导航信号和真实数据监督需求，为高分辨率多器官多激发DWI提供了可解释的稳健解决方案，其扫描仪无关性能对精准肿瘤学具有变革潜力。

Abstract: Clinical adoption of multi-shot diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging
(multi-shot DWI) for body-wide tumor diagnostics is limited by severe
motion-induced phase artifacts from respiration, peristalsis, and so on,
compounded by multi-organ, multi-slice, multi-direction and multi-b-value
complexities. Here, we introduce a reconstruction framework, LoSP-Prompt, that
overcomes these challenges through physics-informed modeling and
synthetic-data-driven prompt learning. We model inter-shot phase variations as
a high-order Locally Smooth Phase (LoSP), integrated into a low-rank Hankel
matrix reconstruction. Crucially, the algorithm's rank parameter is
automatically set via prompt learning trained exclusively on synthetic
abdominal DWI data emulating physiological motion. Validated across 10,000+
clinical images (43 subjects, 4 scanner models, 5 centers), LoSP-Prompt: (1)
Achieved twice the spatial resolution of clinical single-shot DWI, enhancing
liver lesion conspicuity; (2) Generalized to seven diverse anatomical regions
(liver, kidney, sacroiliac, pelvis, knee, spinal cord, brain) with a single
model; (3) Outperformed state-of-the-art methods in image quality, artifact
suppression, and noise reduction (11 radiologists' evaluations on a 5-point
scale, $p<0.05$), achieving 4-5 points (excellent) on kidney DWI, 4 points
(good to excellent) on liver, sacroiliac and spinal cord DWI, and 3-4 points
(good) on knee and tumor brain. The approach eliminates navigator signals and
realistic data supervision, providing an interpretable, robust solution for
high-resolution multi-organ multi-shot DWI. Its scanner-agnostic performance
signifies transformative potential for precision oncology.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Learning to Detect (LoD)框架，通过从攻击特定学习转向任务特定学习，准确检测未知的越狱攻击，包含多模态安全概念激活向量模块和无监督攻击分类模块。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管进行了广泛的对齐努力，大型视觉语言模型仍然容易受到越狱攻击，存在严重的安全风险。现有检测方法要么学习攻击特定参数，阻碍了对未知攻击的泛化能力，要么依赖启发式原则，限制了准确性和效率。

Method: 提出Learning to Detect (LoD)框架，包括多模态安全概念激活向量模块用于安全导向的表征学习，以及安全模式自动编码器模块用于无监督攻击分类。

Result: 大量实验表明，该方法在多样未知攻击上实现了持续更高的检测AUROC，同时提高了效率。

Conclusion: LoD框架通过任务特定学习有效解决了现有越狱攻击检测方法的局限性，在保持高效的同时显著提升了检测性能。

Abstract: Despite extensive alignment efforts, Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs)
remain vulnerable to jailbreak attacks, posing serious safety risks. To address
this, existing detection methods either learn attack-specific parameters, which
hinders generalization to unseen attacks, or rely on heuristically sound
principles, which limit accuracy and efficiency. To overcome these limitations,
we propose Learning to Detect (LoD), a general framework that accurately
detects unknown jailbreak attacks by shifting the focus from attack-specific
learning to task-specific learning. This framework includes a Multi-modal
Safety Concept Activation Vector module for safety-oriented representation
learning and a Safety Pattern Auto-Encoder module for unsupervised attack
classification. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves
consistently higher detection AUROC on diverse unknown attacks while improving
efficiency. The code is available at

*Huan Chen,Ting Han,Siyu Chen,Zhihao Guo,Yiping Chen,Meiliu Wu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Semantic4Safety框架，使用零样本语义分割从街景图像中提取11个可解释的街道景观指标，结合道路类型分析30,000起事故记录，通过XGBoost分类器和SHAP解释特征贡献，应用GPS加权和ATE估计量化因果效应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决街景图像分析中的两个基本挑战：如何构建捕捉事故相关特征的街道级指标，以及如何量化它们对不同事故类型的因果影响。

Method: 使用零样本语义分割从街景图像中提取11个可解释的街道景观指标，结合道路类型作为上下文信息。训练XGBoost多类分类器，使用SHAP解释特征贡献，应用GPS加权和ATE估计控制混杂因素并量化因果效应。

Result: 发现异质性的、特定于事故类型的因果模式：捕捉场景复杂性、暴露度和道路几何形状的特征主导预测能力；更大的可驾驶区域和紧急空间降低风险，而过度视觉开放性可能增加风险。

Conclusion: 通过将预测建模与因果推断相结合，Semantic4Safety支持有针对性的干预措施和高风险走廊诊断，为城市道路安全规划提供了可扩展的、数据驱动的工具。

Abstract: Street-view imagery (SVI) offers a fine-grained lens on traffic risk, yet two
fundamental challenges persist: (1) how to construct street-level indicators
that capture accident-related features, and (2) how to quantify their causal
impacts across different accident types. To address these challenges, we
propose Semantic4Safety, a framework that applies zero-shot semantic
segmentation to SVIs to derive 11 interpretable streetscape indicators, and
integrates road type as contextual information to analyze approximately 30,000
accident records in Austin. Specifically, we train an eXtreme Gradient Boosting
(XGBoost) multi-class classifier and use Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP)
to interpret both global and local feature contributions, and then apply
Generalized Propensity Score (GPS) weighting and Average Treatment Effect (ATE)
estimation to control confounding and quantify causal effects. Results uncover
heterogeneous, accident-type-specific causal patterns: features capturing scene
complexity, exposure, and roadway geometry dominate predictive power; larger
drivable area and emergency space reduce risk, whereas excessive visual
openness can increase it. By bridging predictive modeling with causal
inference, Semantic4Safety supports targeted interventions and high-risk
corridor diagnosis, offering a scalable, data-informed tool for urban road
safety planning.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Predictive-Corrective（PC）范式，通过解耦建模任务加速学习。PCMambaNet包含预测先验模块和校正残差网络，利用解剖知识生成焦点图并专注修正关键区域，在脑MRI分割中仅需1-5个epoch即可达到最优精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决端到端深度学习在数据稀缺领域（如医学影像）中收敛慢、依赖大规模数据集的问题，提高学习效率和适用性。

Method: PC范式将建模任务解耦为两个协同模块：预测先验模块（PPM）利用双侧对称性生成低成本的粗略近似和焦点图；校正残差网络（CRN）学习残差误差，专注修正关键区域和精确病理边界。

Result: 在高分辨率脑MRI分割实验中，PCMambaNet达到最优精度，且仅需1-5个epoch即可收敛，这是传统端到端模型无法实现的性能。

Conclusion: 通过显式融入领域知识简化学习目标，PCMambaNet有效缓解了数据效率低下和过拟合问题，实现了显著的学习加速。

Abstract: Despite the remarkable success of the end-to-end paradigm in deep learning,
it often suffers from slow convergence and heavy reliance on large-scale
datasets, which fundamentally limits its efficiency and applicability in
data-scarce domains such as medical imaging. In this work, we introduce the
Predictive-Corrective (PC) paradigm, a framework that decouples the modeling
task to fundamentally accelerate learning. Building upon this paradigm, we
propose a novel network, termed PCMambaNet. PCMambaNet is composed of two
synergistic modules. First, the Predictive Prior Module (PPM) generates a
coarse approximation at low computational cost, thereby anchoring the search
space. Specifically, the PPM leverages anatomical knowledge-bilateral
symmetry-to predict a 'focus map' of diagnostically relevant asymmetric
regions. Next, the Corrective Residual Network (CRN) learns to model the
residual error, focusing the network's full capacity on refining these
challenging regions and delineating precise pathological boundaries. Extensive
experiments on high-resolution brain MRI segmentation demonstrate that
PCMambaNet achieves state-of-the-art accuracy while converging within only 1-5
epochs-a performance unattainable by conventional end-to-end models. This
dramatic acceleration highlights that by explicitly incorporating domain
knowledge to simplify the learning objective, PCMambaNet effectively mitigates
data inefficiency and overfitting.

*Xuchen Li,Xuzhao Li,Shiyu Hu,Kaiqi Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了证据优先的自适应框架EARL，通过强化学习让模型主动选择最相关帧并进行局部重采样，在多个视频推理基准上达到SOTA性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频大语言模型在长视频推理中存在信息稀释问题，静态均匀帧采样会掩盖关键证据，且现有像素空间视频推理代理缺乏严格的奖励机制来确保证据纯度

Method: 基于"选择更少，推理更多"理念，提出证据感知强化学习框架EARL，动态选择最相关帧并在关键帧周围进行局部重采样以获取细粒度时间细节

Result: 在五个视频推理基准上达到开源视频大语言模型的新SOTA，7B模型在LongVideoBench上达到59.8%，MVBench上69.0%，VideoMME上64.9%

Conclusion: 证据纯度的优先考虑和所提框架的有效性得到验证，EARL训练模型同时学习了有效且高纯度的视觉证据选择策略

Abstract: Long-form video reasoning remains a major challenge for Video Large Language
Models (Video LLMs), as static uniform frame sampling leads to information
dilution and obscures critical evidence. Furthermore, existing pixel-space
video reasoning agents, which are designed to actively interact with the video
to acquire new visual information, remain suboptimal due to their lack of
rigorous reward mechanisms to enforce evidence purity and their inability to
perform temporal information supplementation beyond pre-sampled frames. To
address this critical gap, we propose a novel evidence-prioritized adaptive
framework built upon our core philosophy: "Select Less, Reason More." Our core
contribution is the evidence-aware reinforcement learning (EARL) framework,
which transforms the model into an active interrogator of evidence. EARL is
precisely engineered to dynamically select the most relevant frames and,
crucially, to perform localized re-sampling around the selected key frames to
access fine-grained temporal detail. Extensive experiments on five demanding
video reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that our EARL-trained model achieves new
state-of-the-art among open-source Video LLMs, simultaneously learning an
effective and high-purity visual evidence selection policy. Impressively, our
7B model achieves 59.8% on LongVideoBench, 69.0% on MVBench and 64.9% on
VideoMME. These results highlight the importance of prioritizing evidence
purity and the effectiveness of our framework.

*Nengbo Zhang,Hann Woei Ho*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MAVR-Net是一个基于多视角学习的微型飞行器动作识别框架，通过结合RGB帧、光流和分割掩码三种互补数据，提升MAV运动识别的鲁棒性和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于RGB数据的视觉识别模型难以捕捉MAV复杂的时空运动特征，限制了区分不同动作的能力。

Method: 使用ResNet编码器从每个视角提取特征，采用多尺度特征金字塔保留时空细节，引入跨视角注意力模块建模模态间依赖关系，并设计多视角对齐损失确保语义一致性。

Result: 在基准MAV动作数据集上，该方法在Short MAV、Medium MAV和Long MAV数据集上分别达到97.8%、96.5%和92.8%的准确率，明显优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MAVR-Net通过多视角融合有效提升了MAV动作识别的性能，证明了多模态数据在复杂运动识别中的重要性。

Abstract: Recognizing the motion of Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAVs) is crucial for
enabling cooperative perception and control in autonomous aerial swarms. Yet,
vision-based recognition models relying only on RGB data often fail to capture
the complex spatial temporal characteristics of MAV motion, which limits their
ability to distinguish different actions. To overcome this problem, this paper
presents MAVR-Net, a multi-view learning-based MAV action recognition
framework. Unlike traditional single-view methods, the proposed approach
combines three complementary types of data, including raw RGB frames, optical
flow, and segmentation masks, to improve the robustness and accuracy of MAV
motion recognition. Specifically, ResNet-based encoders are used to extract
discriminative features from each view, and a multi-scale feature pyramid is
adopted to preserve the spatiotemporal details of MAV motion patterns. To
enhance the interaction between different views, a cross-view attention module
is introduced to model the dependencies among various modalities and feature
scales. In addition, a multi-view alignment loss is designed to ensure semantic
consistency and strengthen cross-view feature representations. Experimental
results on benchmark MAV action datasets show that our method clearly
outperforms existing approaches, achieving 97.8\%, 96.5\%, and 92.8\% accuracy
on the Short MAV, Medium MAV, and Long MAV datasets, respectively.

*Zhiqiang Zhu,Xinbo Gao,Wen Lu,Jie Li,Zhaoyang Wang,Mingqian Ge*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DPTrack是一种基于提示学习的夜间航拍跟踪器，通过将目标属性特征编码到富含细粒度线索的方向核中，生成精确的提示来改善夜间跟踪性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于提示学习的夜间航拍跟踪器仅依赖空间定位监督，无法提供指向目标特征的细粒度线索，导致生成模糊的提示，影响跟踪器准确聚焦目标特征的能力。

Method: DPTrack首先分层捕获目标的拓扑结构，利用拓扑属性丰富特征表示；然后通过编码器将这些拓扑感知特征压缩到方向核中；最后基于通道类别对应关系构建核引导提示模块，在搜索区域特征中传播核以定位目标特征位置并转换为精确提示。

Result: 在已建立的基准测试上的广泛评估表明DPTrack具有优越的性能。

Conclusion: DPTrack通过编码目标属性特征到方向核并生成精确提示，有效解决了夜间航拍跟踪中提示模糊的问题，实现了鲁棒的夜间跟踪。

Abstract: Existing nighttime aerial trackers based on prompt learning rely solely on
spatial localization supervision, which fails to provide fine-grained cues that
point to target features and inevitably produces vague prompts. This limitation
impairs the tracker's ability to accurately focus on the object features and
results in trackers still performing poorly. To address this issue, we propose
DPTrack, a prompt-based aerial tracker designed for nighttime scenarios by
encoding the given object's attribute features into the directional kernel
enriched with fine-grained cues to generate precise prompts. Specifically,
drawing inspiration from visual bionics, DPTrack first hierarchically captures
the object's topological structure, leveraging topological attributes to enrich
the feature representation. Subsequently, an encoder condenses these
topology-aware features into the directional kernel, which serves as the core
guidance signal that explicitly encapsulates the object's fine-grained
attribute cues. Finally, a kernel-guided prompt module built on
channel-category correspondence attributes propagates the kernel across the
features of the search region to pinpoint the positions of target features and
convert them into precise prompts, integrating spatial gating for robust
nighttime tracking. Extensive evaluations on established benchmarks demonstrate
DPTrack's superior performance. Our code will be available at
https://github.com/zzq-vipsl/DPTrack.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于动态图像的双阶段时间增强方法，将微表情序列分解为起始到顶点和顶点到结束两个运动阶段，分别生成动态图像，以丰富运动多样性并提升识别性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 微表情识别面临标注数据稀缺的问题，现有方法主要依赖简单的空间增强而忽视了时间增强策略，限制了运动模式的多样性捕捉。

Method: 将每个微表情序列分解为起始到顶点和顶点到结束两个运动阶段，为每个阶段分别生成动态图像，形成双阶段动态图像增强策略。

Result: 在CASME-II和SAMM数据集上的实验表明，该方法在识别准确率、未加权F1分数和未加权平均召回率方面均取得一致提升，结合空间增强可获得高达10%的相对改进。

Conclusion: 该方法简单、模型无关且在低资源设置下有效，为鲁棒和可泛化的微表情识别提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Micro-expressions (MEs) are brief, involuntary facial movements that reveal
genuine emotions, typically lasting less than half a second. Recognizing these
subtle expressions is critical for applications in psychology, security, and
behavioral analysis. Although deep learning has enabled significant advances in
micro-expression recognition (MER), its effectiveness is limited by the
scarcity of annotated ME datasets. This data limitation not only hinders
generalization but also restricts the diversity of motion patterns captured
during training. Existing MER studies predominantly rely on simple spatial
augmentations (e.g., flipping, rotation) and overlook temporal augmentation
strategies that can better exploit motion characteristics. To address this gap,
this paper proposes a phase-aware temporal augmentation method based on dynamic
image. Rather than encoding the entire expression as a single onset-to-offset
dynamic image (DI), our approach decomposes each expression sequence into two
motion phases: onset-to-apex and apex-to-offset. A separate DI is generated for
each phase, forming a Dual-phase DI augmentation strategy. These phase-specific
representations enrich motion diversity and introduce complementary temporal
cues that are crucial for recognizing subtle facial transitions. Extensive
experiments on CASME-II and SAMM datasets using six deep architectures,
including CNNs, Vision Transformer, and the lightweight LEARNet, demonstrate
consistent performance improvements in recognition accuracy, unweighted
F1-score, and unweighted average recall, which are crucial for addressing class
imbalance in MER. When combined with spatial augmentations, our method achieves
up to a 10\% relative improvement. The proposed augmentation is simple,
model-agnostic, and effective in low-resource settings, offering a promising
direction for robust and generalizable MER.

Motivation: 传统SfM方法在多相机系统捕捉的驾驶场景中存在相机位姿估计不可靠、道路表面重建异常点多、重建效率低等问题，需要专门针对驾驶场景的改进方案。

Method: 利用多相机系统的固定空间关系增强相机位姿估计；采用平面模型去除道路表面重建中的错误点；将多相机系统作为单一单元进行束调整以减少优化变量；通过场景关联和组装模块实现多场景聚合。

Result: 在nuScenes数据集上实现了0.124的绝对位姿误差，表现出最先进的性能；在实际车辆部署中验证了MRASfM在不同场景下的通用性和在挑战性条件下的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: MRASfM框架有效解决了驾驶场景中SfM应用的关键问题，在相机位姿估计、道路表面重建和计算效率方面都取得了显著改进，在公开数据集上达到了最先进的性能水平。

Abstract: Structure from Motion (SfM) estimates camera poses and reconstructs point
clouds, forming a foundation for various tasks. However, applying SfM to
driving scenes captured by multi-camera systems presents significant
difficulties, including unreliable pose estimation, excessive outliers in road
surface reconstruction, and low reconstruction efficiency. To address these
limitations, we propose a Multi-camera Reconstruction and Aggregation
Structure-from-Motion (MRASfM) framework specifically designed for driving
scenes. MRASfM enhances the reliability of camera pose estimation by leveraging
the fixed spatial relationships within the multi-camera system during the
registration process. To improve the quality of road surface reconstruction,
our framework employs a plane model to effectively remove erroneous points from
the triangulated road surface. Moreover, treating the multi-camera set as a
single unit in Bundle Adjustment (BA) helps reduce optimization variables to
boost efficiency. In addition, MRASfM achieves multi-scene aggregation through
scene association and assembly modules in a coarse-to-fine fashion. We deployed
multi-camera systems on actual vehicles to validate the generalizability of
MRASfM across various scenes and its robustness in challenging conditions
through real-world applications. Furthermore, large-scale validation results on
public datasets show the state-of-the-art performance of MRASfM, achieving
0.124 absolute pose error on the nuScenes dataset.

Result: 在CASMEII和SAMM数据集上的实验结果表明，COF方法优于单一光学流方法，能更有效地捕捉微表情动态特征。

Conclusion: COF方法通过整合微表情的两个关键阶段，显著提升了微表情识别性能，证明了其有效性。

Abstract: Facial micro-expressions are brief, involuntary facial movements that reveal
hidden emotions. Most Micro-Expression Recognition (MER) methods that rely on
optical flow typically focus on the onset-to-apex phase, neglecting the

a Combined Optical Flow (COF), integrating both phases to enhance feature
representation. COF provides a more comprehensive motion analysis, improving
MER performance. Experimental results on CASMEII and SAMM datasets show that
COF outperforms single optical flow-based methods, demonstrating its
effectiveness in capturing micro-expression dynamics.

Conclusion: 该自动化管道能够生成高质量的植物3D重建，解决了运动引起的重建问题，并将公开源代码和数据集

Abstract: 3D phenotyping of plants plays a crucial role for understanding plant growth,
yield prediction, and disease control. We present a pipeline capable of
generating high-quality 3D reconstructions of individual agricultural plants.
To acquire data, a small commercially available UAV captures images of a
selected plant. Apart from placing ArUco markers, the entire image acquisition
process is fully autonomous, controlled by a self-developed Android application
running on the drone's controller. The reconstruction task is particularly
challenging due to environmental wind and downwash of the UAV. Our proposed
pipeline supports the integration of arbitrary state-of-the-art 3D
reconstruction methods. To mitigate errors caused by leaf motion during image
capture, we use an iterative method that gradually adjusts the input images
through deformation. Motion is estimated using optical flow between the
original input images and intermediate 3D reconstructions rendered from the
corresponding viewpoints. This alignment gradually reduces scene motion,
resulting in a canonical representation. After a few iterations, our pipeline
improves the reconstruction of state-of-the-art methods and enables the
extraction of high-resolution 3D meshes. We will publicly release the source
code of our reconstruction pipeline. Additionally, we provide a dataset
consisting of multiple plants from various crops, captured across different
points in time.

Conclusion: HiMA架构通过有效结合不同模块的优势，成功解决了低光RAW图像增强中的效率和质量平衡问题，为相关任务提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Low-light RAW image enhancement remains a challenging task. Although numerous
deep learning based approaches have been proposed, they still suffer from
inherent limitations. A key challenge is how to simultaneously achieve strong
enhancement quality and high efficiency. In this paper, we rethink the
architecture for efficient low-light image signal processing (ISP) and
introduce a Hierarchical Mixing Architecture (HiMA). HiMA leverages the
complementary strengths of Transformer and Mamba modules to handle features at
large and small scales, respectively, thereby improving efficiency while
avoiding the ambiguities observed in prior two-stage frameworks. To further
address uneven illumination with strong local variations, we propose Local
Distribution Adjustment (LoDA), which adaptively aligns feature distributions
across different local regions. In addition, to fully exploit the denoised
outputs from the first stage, we design a Multi-prior Fusion (MPF) module that
integrates spatial and frequency-domain priors for detail enhancement.
Extensive experiments on multiple public datasets demonstrate that our method
outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, achieving superior performance with
fewer parameters. Code will be released at https://github.com/Cynicarlos/HiMA.

Motivation: 预训练的视觉表示在模仿学习中通常保持任务无关性，在策略学习期间保持冻结状态。本文探索如何利用预训练的文本到图像扩散模型获得任务自适应的视觉表示，而无需微调模型本身。

Method: 提出ORCA方法，引入可学习的任务提示来适应控制环境，以及视觉提示来捕获细粒度的帧特定细节。通过新设计的条件促进任务自适应表示。

Result: 在多个机器人控制基准测试中实现了最先进的性能，显著超越先前的方法。

Conclusion: 通过考虑控制所需的具体动态视觉信息，利用扩散模型的条件机制可以有效地为机器人控制提供任务自适应视觉表示。

Abstract: While pre-trained visual representations have significantly advanced
imitation learning, they are often task-agnostic as they remain frozen during
policy learning. In this work, we explore leveraging pre-trained text-to-image
diffusion models to obtain task-adaptive visual representations for robotic
control, without fine-tuning the model itself. However, we find that naively
applying textual conditions - a successful strategy in other vision domains -
yields minimal or even negative gains in control tasks. We attribute this to
the domain gap between the diffusion model's training data and robotic control
environments, leading us to argue for conditions that consider the specific,
dynamic visual information required for control. To this end, we propose ORCA,
which introduces learnable task prompts that adapt to the control environment
and visual prompts that capture fine-grained, frame-specific details. Through
facilitating task-adaptive representations with our newly devised conditions,
our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on various robotic control

### [54] [Latent Feature Alignment: Discovering Biased and Interpretable Subpopulations in Face Recognition Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15520)
*Ignacio Serna*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需属性标签的潜在特征对齐方法，用于识别人脸识别模型中的偏差子群体，相比传统聚类方法能产生更语义一致的组别和可解释的潜在方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代人脸识别模型虽然整体准确率高，但仍存在系统性偏差，传统基于标注属性的偏差评估框架成本高且局限于预定义类别。

Method: 使用潜在方向识别子群体的潜在特征对齐算法，通过语义一致性分组和发现可解释方向来改进标准聚类方法。

Result: 在四种最先进的人脸识别模型和两个基准测试上，LFA在组内语义一致性方面持续优于k-means和最近邻搜索，并发现了与人口统计和上下文属性对齐的可解释潜在方向。

Conclusion: LFA可作为人脸识别模型表示审计的实用方法，使从业者能够在没有预定义属性标注的情况下识别和解释偏差子群体。

Abstract: Modern face recognition models achieve high overall accuracy but continue to
exhibit systematic biases that disproportionately affect certain
subpopulations. Conventional bias evaluation frameworks rely on labeled
attributes to form subpopulations, which are expensive to obtain and limited to
predefined categories. We introduce Latent Feature Alignment (LFA), an
attribute-label-free algorithm that uses latent directions to identify
subpopulations. This yields two main benefits over standard clustering: (i)
semantically coherent grouping, where faces sharing common attributes are
grouped together more reliably than by proximity-based methods, and (ii)
discovery of interpretable directions, which correspond to semantic attributes
such as age, ethnicity, or attire. Across four state-of-the-art recognition
models (ArcFace, CosFace, ElasticFace, PartialFC) and two benchmarks (RFW,
CelebA), LFA consistently outperforms k-means and nearest-neighbor search in
intra-group semantic coherence, while uncovering interpretable latent
directions aligned with demographic and contextual attributes. These results
position LFA as a practical method for representation auditing of face
recognition models, enabling practitioners to identify and interpret biased
subpopulations without predefined attribute annotations.

*Aditya Vir*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种用于卫星土地利用分类的自定义卷积神经网络架构，在EuroSAT数据集上达到97.23%的测试准确率，无需预训练模型。主要贡献是新颖的平衡多任务注意力机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决卫星图像分类中的特定失败模式，探索无需依赖预训练模型的高效卫星图像分类方法。

Method: 通过三个渐进架构迭代：基线模型、CBAM增强模型和平衡多任务注意力模型。使用坐标注意力进行空间特征提取，挤压激励块进行光谱特征提取，通过可学习融合参数统一。采用渐进DropBlock正则化和类平衡损失加权。

Result: 最终12层架构达到97.23%测试准确率，Cohen's Kappa为0.9692，所有类别准确率超过94.46%。可学习参数自主收敛到alpha≈0.57，表明空间和光谱模态重要性相近。

Conclusion: 系统化架构设计在特定领域应用中具有高效性，性能接近微调ResNet-50（98.57%），但无需外部数据，验证了该方法在卫星图像分类中的有效性。

Abstract: This work presents a systematic investigation of custom convolutional neural
network architectures for satellite land use classification, achieving 97.23%
test accuracy on the EuroSAT dataset without reliance on pre-trained models.
Through three progressive architectural iterations (baseline: 94.30%,
CBAM-enhanced: 95.98%, and balanced multi-task attention: 97.23%) we identify
and address specific failure modes in satellite imagery classification. Our
principal contribution is a novel balanced multi-task attention mechanism that
combines Coordinate Attention for spatial feature extraction with
Squeeze-Excitation blocks for spectral feature extraction, unified through a
learnable fusion parameter. Experimental results demonstrate that this
learnable parameter autonomously converges to alpha approximately 0.57,
indicating near-equal importance of spatial and spectral modalities for
satellite imagery. We employ progressive DropBlock regularization (5-20% by
network depth) and class-balanced loss weighting to address overfitting and
confusion pattern imbalance. The final 12-layer architecture achieves Cohen's
Kappa of 0.9692 with all classes exceeding 94.46% accuracy, demonstrating
confidence calibration with a 24.25% gap between correct and incorrect
predictions. Our approach achieves performance within 1.34% of fine-tuned
ResNet-50 (98.57%) while requiring no external data, validating the efficacy of
systematic architectural design for domain-specific applications. Complete
code, trained models, and evaluation scripts are publicly available.

TL;DR: SiM2P是一个基于3D扩散桥的框架，能够从MRI和患者辅助信息生成诊断质量的FDG-PET模拟图像，显著提高了痴呆症诊断准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FDG-PET在痴呆症诊断中很有价值，但相比常规MRI更昂贵且不易获得。研究旨在开发一种从MRI模拟PET图像的方法，使PET的诊断优势更易获得。

Method: 使用3D扩散桥框架学习从MRI和患者辅助信息到FDG-PET图像的概率映射，生成诊断质量的模拟PET图像。

Result: 在盲法临床研究中，SiM2P将三组（阿尔茨海默病、行为变异型额颞叶痴呆、认知健康对照）的总体诊断准确率从75.0%提高到84.7%，且模拟PET图像获得更高的诊断确定性和评分者间一致性。

Conclusion: SiM2P框架使FDG-PET成像的诊断优势更易获得，仅需20个特定病例和基本人口统计学信息即可部署，有望改善资源有限环境下的早期检测和鉴别诊断。

Abstract: Positron emission tomography (PET) with 18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) is an
established tool in the diagnostic workup of patients with suspected dementing
disorders. However, compared to the routinely available magnetic resonance
imaging (MRI), FDG-PET remains significantly less accessible and substantially
more expensive. Here, we present SiM2P, a 3D diffusion bridge-based framework
that learns a probabilistic mapping from MRI and auxiliary patient information
to simulate FDG-PET images of diagnostic quality. In a blinded clinical reader
study, two neuroradiologists and two nuclear medicine physicians rated the
original MRI and SiM2P-simulated PET images of patients with Alzheimer's
disease, behavioral-variant frontotemporal dementia, and cognitively healthy
controls. SiM2P significantly improved the overall diagnostic accuracy of
differentiating between three groups from 75.0% to 84.7% (p<0.05). Notably, the
simulated PET images received higher diagnostic certainty ratings and achieved
superior interrater agreement compared to the MRI images. Finally, we developed
a practical workflow for local deployment of the SiM2P framework. It requires
as few as 20 site-specific cases and only basic demographic information. This
approach makes the established diagnostic benefits of FDG-PET imaging more
accessible to patients with suspected dementing disorders, potentially
improving early detection and differential diagnosis in resource-limited
settings. Our code is available at https://github.com/Yiiitong/SiM2P.

TL;DR: ClapperText是一个用于手写和打印文本识别的基准数据集，专门针对视觉退化和低资源环境，包含9,813个标注帧和94,573个单词级文本实例，主要来自二战时期的档案视频片段。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决历史文档分析中结构化内容在退化、非标准形式下出现的挑战，包括运动模糊、手写变化、曝光波动和杂乱背景等问题。

Method: 从127个二战时期档案视频片段中提取包含拍板的生产元数据，提供全帧标注和裁剪单词图像，使用旋转边界框作为4点多边形进行空间精确OCR标注。

Result: 在零样本和微调条件下评估了6个识别模型和7个检测模型，尽管训练集较小（18个视频），微调仍带来显著性能提升，展示了数据集在少样本学习场景中的适用性。

Conclusion: ClapperText为低资源档案环境中的鲁棒OCR和文档理解提供了一个现实且文化基础丰富的资源，支持历史文档分析的研究进展。

Abstract: This paper presents ClapperText, a benchmark dataset for handwritten and
printed text recognition in visually degraded and low-resource settings. The
dataset is derived from 127 World War II-era archival video segments containing
clapperboards that record structured production metadata such as date,
location, and camera-operator identity. ClapperText includes 9,813 annotated
frames and 94,573 word-level text instances, 67% of which are handwritten and
1,566 are partially occluded. Each instance includes transcription, semantic
category, text type, and occlusion status, with annotations available as
rotated bounding boxes represented as 4-point polygons to support spatially
precise OCR applications. Recognizing clapperboard text poses significant
challenges, including motion blur, handwriting variation, exposure
fluctuations, and cluttered backgrounds, mirroring broader challenges in
historical document analysis where structured content appears in degraded,
non-standard forms. We provide both full-frame annotations and cropped word
images to support downstream tasks. Using a consistent per-video evaluation
protocol, we benchmark six representative recognition and seven detection
models under zero-shot and fine-tuned conditions. Despite the small training
set (18 videos), fine-tuning leads to substantial performance gains,
highlighting ClapperText's suitability for few-shot learning scenarios. The
dataset offers a realistic and culturally grounded resource for advancing
robust OCR and document understanding in low-resource archival contexts. The
dataset and evaluation code are available at

Conclusion: 提出的视觉引导3D布局生成系统能够有效解决现有方法的局限性，生成艺术性强且连贯的3D场景布局。

Abstract: Generating artistic and coherent 3D scene layouts is crucial in digital
content creation. Traditional optimization-based methods are often constrained
by cumbersome manual rules, while deep generative models face challenges in
producing content with richness and diversity. Furthermore, approaches that
utilize large language models frequently lack robustness and fail to accurately
capture complex spatial relationships. To address these challenges, this paper
presents a novel vision-guided 3D layout generation system. We first construct
a high-quality asset library containing 2,037 scene assets and 147 3D scene
layouts. Subsequently, we employ an image generation model to expand prompt
representations into images, fine-tuning it to align with our asset library. We
then develop a robust image parsing module to recover the 3D layout of scenes
based on visual semantics and geometric information. Finally, we optimize the
scene layout using scene graphs and overall visual semantics to ensure logical
coherence and alignment with the images. Extensive user testing demonstrates
that our algorithm significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of
layout richness and quality. The code and dataset will be available at

Method: 集成三个专用编码器：全局视角编码器检测边界不一致性，中观视角编码器分析纹理和颜色对齐，局部视角编码器捕捉眼睛、鼻子和嘴巴等表情区域的失真。还加入面部朝向编码器分类面部姿态。

Result: 在具有挑战性的数据集上的实验结果表明，该方法优于传统的单视角方法，即使在具有挑战性的姿态和光照条件下也能有效检测篡改图像。

Conclusion: 多视角架构通过融合不同层次的面部特征，显著提升了DeepFake检测性能，特别是在处理姿态变化和复杂场景时表现出色。

Abstract: DeepFake technology has advanced significantly in recent years, enabling the
creation of highly realistic synthetic face images. Existing DeepFake detection
methods often struggle with pose variations, occlusions, and artifacts that are
difficult to detect in real-world conditions. To address these challenges, we
propose a multi-view architecture that enhances DeepFake detection by analyzing
facial features at multiple levels. Our approach integrates three specialized
encoders, a global view encoder for detecting boundary inconsistencies, a
middle view encoder for analyzing texture and color alignment, and a local view
encoder for capturing distortions in expressive facial regions such as the
eyes, nose, and mouth, where DeepFake artifacts frequently occur. Additionally,
we incorporate a face orientation encoder, trained to classify face poses,
ensuring robust detection across various viewing angles. By fusing features
from these encoders, our model achieves superior performance in detecting
manipulated images, even under challenging pose and lighting
conditions.Experimental results on challenging datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method, outperforming conventional single-view approaches

Result: 参数从4180万减少到约9000个，性能更优，训练更快，内存使用更低。

Conclusion: 该模型可作为验证显微镜工作流中实验准确性和图像保真度的实用工具。

Abstract: Lightweight deep learning models offer substantial reductions in
computational cost and environmental impact, making them crucial for scientific
applications. We present a lightweight CycleGAN for modality transfer in
fluorescence microscopy (confocal to super-resolution STED/deconvolved STED),
addressing the common challenge of unpaired datasets. By replacing the
traditional channel-doubling strategy in the U-Net-based generator with a fixed
channel approach, we drastically reduce trainable parameters from 41.8 million
to approximately nine thousand, achieving superior performance with faster
training and lower memory usage. We also introduce the GAN as a diagnostic tool
for experimental and labeling quality. When trained on high-quality images, the
GAN learns the characteristics of optimal imaging; deviations between its
generated outputs and new experimental images can reveal issues such as
photobleaching, artifacts, or inaccurate labeling. This establishes the model
as a practical tool for validating experimental accuracy and image fidelity in
microscopy workflows.

TL;DR: 提出了两种标准化方法来改进时空图像融合：基于传统上采样的方法和基于锐化的ABSIS方法，后者通过结合精细分辨率图像系列的整体特征与特定粗分辨率图像的独特属性，显著提升了USTFIP方法的融合精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 时空图像融合方法通常需要不同传感器捕获的具有匹配空间和光谱分辨率的图像集，为了促进STIF方法的应用，需要开发标准化方法来处理分辨率不匹配的问题。

Method: 提出了两种标准化方法：1) 基于传统上采样的方法；2) 锐化方法ABSIS，该方法将精细分辨率图像系列的整体特征与特定粗分辨率图像的独特属性相结合，生成更接近精细分辨率图像聚合结果的标准图像。

Result: 两种方法都显著提高了USTFIP STIF方法的准确性，其中锐化方法将融合图像的光谱和空间精度分别提高了高达49.46%和78.40%。

Conclusion: 提出的标准化方法，特别是ABSIS锐化方法，能够有效提升时空图像融合的精度，为STIF方法的应用提供了更好的支持。

Abstract: Spatio-Temporal Image Fusion (STIF) methods usually require sets of images
with matching spatial and spectral resolutions captured by different sensors.
To facilitate the application of STIF methods, we propose and compare two
different standardization approaches. The first method is based on traditional
upscaling of the fine-resolution images. The second method is a sharpening
approach called Anomaly Based Satellite Image Standardization (ABSIS) that
blends the overall features found in the fine-resolution image series with the
distinctive attributes of a specific coarse-resolution image to produce images
that more closely resemble the outcome of aggregating the fine-resolution
images. Both methods produce a significant increase in accuracy of the Unpaired
Spatio Temporal Fusion of Image Patches (USTFIP) STIF method, with the
sharpening approach increasing the spectral and spatial accuracies of the fused
images by up to 49.46\% and 78.40\%, respectively.

Conclusion: FlexiReID框架为多模态行人重识别提供了灵活且有效的解决方案，支持多种模态组合的检索任务。

Abstract: Multimodal person re-identification (Re-ID) aims to match pedestrian images
across different modalities. However, most existing methods focus on limited
cross-modal settings and fail to support arbitrary query-retrieval
combinations, hindering practical deployment. We propose FlexiReID, a flexible
framework that supports seven retrieval modes across four modalities: rgb,
infrared, sketches, and text. FlexiReID introduces an adaptive
mixture-of-experts (MoE) mechanism to dynamically integrate diverse modality
features and a cross-modal query fusion module to enhance multimodal feature
extraction. To facilitate comprehensive evaluation, we construct CIRS-PEDES, a
unified dataset extending four popular Re-ID datasets to include all four
modalities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FlexiReID achieves
state-of-the-art performance and offers strong generalization in complex
scenarios.

Conclusion: QFCA方法在保持高精度的同时显著提升了运行速度，适用于实时纹理异常检测场景

Abstract: Zero-shot anomaly localization is a rising field in computer vision research,
with important progress in recent years. This work focuses on the problem of
detecting and localizing anomalies in textures, where anomalies can be defined
as the regions that deviate from the overall statistics, violating the
stationarity assumption. The main limitation of existing methods is their high
running time, making them impractical for deployment in real-world scenarios,
such as assembly line monitoring. We propose a real-time method, named QFCA,
which implements a quantized version of the feature correspondence analysis
(FCA) algorithm. By carefully adapting the patch statistics comparison to work
on histograms of quantized values, we obtain a 10x speedup with little to no
loss in accuracy. Moreover, we introduce a feature preprocessing step based on
principal component analysis, which enhances the contrast between normal and
anomalous features, improving the detection precision on complex textures. Our
method is thoroughly evaluated against prior art, comparing favorably with
existing methods. Project page:

Abstract: Current self-supervised denoising techniques achieve impressive results, yet
their real-world application is frequently constrained by substantial
computational and memory demands, necessitating a compromise between inference
speed and reconstruction quality. In this paper, we present an
ultra-lightweight model that addresses this challenge, achieving both fast
denoising and high quality image restoration. Built upon the Noise2Noise
training framework-which removes the reliance on clean reference images or
explicit noise modeling-we introduce an innovative multistage denoising
pipeline named Noise2Detail (N2D). During inference, this approach disrupts the
spatial correlations of noise patterns to produce intermediate smooth
structures, which are subsequently refined to recapture fine details directly
from the noisy input. Extensive testing reveals that Noise2Detail surpasses
existing dataset-free techniques in performance, while requiring only a
fraction of the computational resources. This combination of efficiency, low
computational cost, and data-free approach make it a valuable tool for
biomedical imaging, overcoming the challenges of scarce clean training data-due
to rare and complex imaging modalities-while enabling fast inference for
practical use.

Abstract: Domain adaptation is a crucial and increasingly important task in remote
sensing, aiming to transfer knowledge from a source domain a differently
distributed target domain. It has broad applications across various real-world
applications, including remote sensing element interpretation, ecological
environment monitoring, and urban/rural planning. However, domain adaptation in
remote sensing poses significant challenges due to differences in data, such as
variations in ground sampling distance, imaging modes from various sensors,
geographical landscapes, and environmental conditions. In recent years, deep
learning has emerged as a powerful tool for feature representation and
cross-domain knowledge transfer, leading to widespread adoption in remote
sensing tasks. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey of significant
advancements in deep learning based domain adaptation for remote sensing. We
first introduce the preliminary knowledge to clarify key concepts, mathematical
notations, and the taxonomy of methodologies. We then organize existing
algorithms from multiple perspectives, including task categorization, input
mode, supervision paradigm, and algorithmic granularity, providing readers with
a structured understanding of the field. Next, we review widely used datasets
and summarize the performance of state-of-the-art methods to provide an
overview of current progress. We also identify open challenges and potential
directions to guide future research in domain adaptation for remote sensing.
Compared to previous surveys, this work addresses a broader range of domain
adaptation tasks in remote sensing, rather than concentrating on a few
subfields. It also presents a systematic taxonomy, providing a more
comprehensive and organized understanding of the field. As a whole, this survey
can inspire the research community, foster understanding, and guide future work
in the field.

Conclusion: 所提出的弱监督框架在超声图像分割中具有有效性和实用性，为降低医学图像分割标注成本提供了可行方案

Abstract: Automatic medical image segmentation is a fundamental step in computer-aided
diagnosis, yet fully supervised approaches demand extensive pixel-level
annotations that are costly and time-consuming. To alleviate this burden, we
propose a weakly supervised segmentation framework that leverages only four
extreme points as annotation. Specifically, bounding boxes derived from the
extreme points are used as prompts for the Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) to
generate reliable initial pseudo labels. These pseudo labels are progressively
refined by an enhanced Feature-Guided Extreme Point Masking (FGEPM) algorithm,
which incorporates Monte Carlo dropout-based uncertainty estimation to
construct a unified gradient uncertainty cost map for boundary tracing.
Furthermore, a dual-branch Uncertainty-aware Scale Consistency (USC) loss and a
box alignment loss are introduced to ensure spatial consistency and precise
boundary alignment during training. Extensive experiments on two public
ultrasound datasets, BUSI and UNS, demonstrate that our method achieves
performance comparable to, and even surpassing fully supervised counterparts
while significantly reducing annotation cost. These results validate the
effectiveness and practicality of the proposed weakly supervised framework for
ultrasound image segmentation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于多模态视觉Transformer自编码器的无监督异常检测方法，用于脑肿瘤分割，无需依赖标注数据，在BraTS-GoAT 2025数据集上取得了有临床意义的肿瘤定位效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决脑肿瘤分割中标注数据有限、成本高或不一致的问题，提供可扩展的无监督解决方案。

Method: 使用多模态视觉Transformer自编码器，仅用健康脑部MRI训练，通过重建误差图检测肿瘤；采用多模态早期-晚期融合策略和集成Segment Anything Model的后处理流程。

Result: 在测试集上获得病变级别的Dice相似系数：全肿瘤0.437、肿瘤核心0.316、增强肿瘤0.350；验证集异常检测率达到89.4%。

Conclusion: 基于Transformer的无监督模型有潜力成为神经肿瘤影像学中可扩展、标签高效的工具。

Abstract: Unsupervised anomaly detection (UAD) presents a complementary alternative to
supervised learning for brain tumor segmentation in magnetic resonance imaging
(MRI), particularly when annotated datasets are limited, costly, or
inconsistent. In this work, we propose a novel Multimodal Vision Transformer
Autoencoder (MViT-AE) trained exclusively on healthy brain MRIs to detect and
localize tumors via reconstruction-based error maps. This unsupervised paradigm
enables segmentation without reliance on manual labels, addressing a key
scalability bottleneck in neuroimaging workflows. Our method is evaluated in
the BraTS-GoAT 2025 Lighthouse dataset, which includes various types of tumors
such as gliomas, meningiomas, and pediatric brain tumors. To enhance
performance, we introduce a multimodal early-late fusion strategy that
leverages complementary information across multiple MRI sequences, and a
post-processing pipeline that integrates the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to
refine predicted tumor contours. Despite the known challenges of UAD,
particularly in detecting small or non-enhancing lesions, our method achieves
clinically meaningful tumor localization, with lesion-wise Dice Similarity
Coefficient of 0.437 (Whole Tumor), 0.316 (Tumor Core), and 0.350 (Enhancing
Tumor) on the test set, and an anomaly Detection Rate of 89.4% on the
validation set. These findings highlight the potential of transformer-based
unsupervised models to serve as scalable, label-efficient tools for
neuro-oncological imaging.

TL;DR: 提出了UniMedVL，首个医学统一多模态模型，能在单一架构中同时处理图像理解和生成任务，通过观察-知识-分析(OKA)范式实现双向知识共享。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医学AI系统将图像理解和图像生成分离，导致数据表示、特征集成和多模态能力存在差距，而实际医疗诊断需要同时处理多模态输入和多样化输出。

Method: 采用多级框架：观察层构建UniMed-5M数据集；知识层提出渐进式课程学习；分析层开发UniMedVL统一模型，支持图像理解和生成任务。

Result: 在5个医学图像理解基准测试中表现优异，在8种医学成像模态的生成质量上与专用模型相当，且生成任务能增强视觉理解特征。

Conclusion: 在单一医学框架内整合传统分离的能力，能够解锁跨多种医学视觉-语言任务的改进，实现双向知识共享。

Abstract: Medical diagnostic applications require models that can process multimodal
medical inputs (images, patient histories, lab results) and generate diverse
outputs including both textual reports and visual content (annotations,
segmentation masks, and images). Despite this need, existing medical AI systems
disrupt this unified process: medical image understanding models interpret
images but cannot generate visual outputs, while medical image generation
models synthesize images but cannot provide textual explanations. This leads to
gaps in data representation, feature integration, and task-level multimodal
capabilities. To this end, we propose a multi-level framework that draws
inspiration from diagnostic workflows through the
Observation-Knowledge-Analysis (OKA) paradigm. Specifically, at the observation
level, we construct UniMed-5M, a dataset comprising over 5.6M samples that
reformat diverse unimodal data into multimodal pairs for foundational
observation. At the knowledge level, we propose Progressive Curriculum Learning
that systematically introduces medical multimodal knowledge. At the analysis
level, we introduce UniMedVL, the first medical unified multimodal model for
the simultaneous analysis of image understanding and generation tasks within a
single architecture. UniMedVL achieves superior performance on five medical
image understanding benchmarks, while matching specialized models in generation
quality across eight medical imaging modalities. Crucially, our unified
architecture enables bidirectional knowledge sharing: generation tasks enhance
visual understanding features, demonstrating that integrating traditionally
separate capabilities within a single medical framework unlocks improvements
across diverse medical vision-language tasks. Code is available at

TL;DR: 提出了DGME-T方法，通过注入方向性网格运动编码来增强Video Swin Transformer，在档案影片分析中显著提升了运动分类性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统相机运动分类模型在处理档案影片时性能下降的问题，因为档案影片存在噪声、缺失帧和低对比度等挑战

Method: 构建统一基准数据集，并在Video Swin Transformer基础上引入方向性网格运动编码，通过可学习的归一化后期融合层注入光流信息

Result: DGME-T将现代视频的top-1准确率从81.78%提升至86.14%，宏观F1从82.08%提升至87.81%；在二战档案影片上准确率从83.43%提升至84.62%，宏观F1从81.72%提升至82.63%

Conclusion: 结构化运动先验与Transformer表示具有互补性，即使小规模精心校准的运动头也能显著增强退化影片分析的鲁棒性

Abstract: Camera movement classification (CMC) models trained on contemporary,
high-quality footage often degrade when applied to archival film, where noise,
missing frames, and low contrast obscure motion cues. We bridge this gap by
assembling a unified benchmark that consolidates two modern corpora into four
canonical classes and restructures the HISTORIAN collection into five balanced
categories. Building on this benchmark, we introduce DGME-T, a lightweight
extension to the Video Swin Transformer that injects directional grid motion
encoding, derived from optical flow, via a learnable and normalised late-fusion
layer. DGME-T raises the backbone's top-1 accuracy from 81.78% to 86.14% and
its macro F1 from 82.08% to 87.81% on modern clips, while still improving the
demanding World-War-II footage from 83.43% to 84.62% accuracy and from 81.72%
to 82.63% macro F1. A cross-domain study further shows that an intermediate
fine-tuning stage on modern data increases historical performance by more than
five percentage points. These results demonstrate that structured motion priors
and transformer representations are complementary and that even a small,
carefully calibrated motion head can substantially enhance robustness in
degraded film analysis. Related resources are available at

Conclusion: Ditto框架成功解决了基于指令的视频编辑中数据稀缺的核心问题，通过系统化的数据生成和质量控制方法，为这一领域的发展提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Instruction-based video editing promises to democratize content creation, yet
its progress is severely hampered by the scarcity of large-scale, high-quality
training data. We introduce Ditto, a holistic framework designed to tackle this
fundamental challenge. At its heart, Ditto features a novel data generation
pipeline that fuses the creative diversity of a leading image editor with an
in-context video generator, overcoming the limited scope of existing models. To
make this process viable, our framework resolves the prohibitive cost-quality
trade-off by employing an efficient, distilled model architecture augmented by
a temporal enhancer, which simultaneously reduces computational overhead and
improves temporal coherence. Finally, to achieve full scalability, this entire
pipeline is driven by an intelligent agent that crafts diverse instructions and
rigorously filters the output, ensuring quality control at scale. Using this
framework, we invested over 12,000 GPU-days to build Ditto-1M, a new dataset of
one million high-fidelity video editing examples. We trained our model, Editto,
on Ditto-1M with a curriculum learning strategy. The results demonstrate
superior instruction-following ability and establish a new state-of-the-art in
instruction-based video editing.

TL;DR: 提出SEGA方法，通过分层推理框架和从粗到细策略解决内容感知布局生成问题，在多个基准数据集上达到最先进水平


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法采用单步推理框架，缺乏反馈式自校正机制，在复杂元素布局规划时失败率显著增加

Method: SEGA采用分层推理框架：粗粒度模块粗略估计布局规划结果，精炼模块对粗规划结果进行细粒度推理，并融入布局设计原则作为先验知识

Result: 在多个基准数据集上实现了最先进的结果，证明了方法的有效性

Conclusion: SEGA通过分步演化范式显著提升了内容感知布局生成的性能，特别是在复杂布局规划场景下

Abstract: In this paper, we study the content-aware layout generation problem, which
aims to automatically generate layouts that are harmonious with a given
background image. Existing methods usually deal with this task with a
single-step reasoning framework. The lack of a feedback-based self-correction
mechanism leads to their failure rates significantly increasing when faced with
complex element layout planning. To address this challenge, we introduce SEGA,
a novel Stepwise Evolution Paradigm for Content-Aware Layout Generation.
Inspired by the systematic mode of human thinking, SEGA employs a hierarchical
reasoning framework with a coarse-to-fine strategy: first, a coarse-level
module roughly estimates the layout planning results; then, another refining
module performs fine-level reasoning regarding the coarse planning results.
Furthermore, we incorporate layout design principles as prior knowledge into
the model to enhance its layout planning ability. Besides, we present
GenPoster-100K that is a new large-scale poster dataset with rich
meta-information annotation. The experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of
our approach by achieving the state-of-the-art results on multiple benchmark
datasets. Our project page is at: https://brucew91.github.io/SEGA.github.io/

TL;DR: 提出了NDM框架，首个基于噪声的检测和缓解方法，用于处理文本到图像生成中的隐含恶意意图，同时保持模型生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到图像扩散模型在面对隐含性暗示提示时容易生成不当内容，而现有检测方法主要针对显式内容，无法有效识别这些微妙暗示。微调方法虽然有效但会降低生成质量。

Method: 提出噪声驱动的检测和缓解框架：1）利用早期预测噪声的可分离性开发基于噪声的检测方法；2）提出噪声增强的自适应负向引导机制，通过抑制显著区域注意力来优化初始噪声。

Result: 在自然和对抗性数据集上的实验验证表明，NDM在性能上优于现有最先进方法（如SLD、UCE、RECE等）。

Conclusion: NDM框架能够有效检测和缓解文本到图像生成中的隐含恶意意图，同时保持模型的原始生成能力，为解决模型偏见和伦理问题提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Despite the impressive generative capabilities of text-to-image (T2I)
diffusion models, they remain vulnerable to generating inappropriate content,
especially when confronted with implicit sexual prompts. Unlike explicit
harmful prompts, these subtle cues, often disguised as seemingly benign terms,
can unexpectedly trigger sexual content due to underlying model biases, raising
significant ethical concerns. However, existing detection methods are primarily
designed to identify explicit sexual content and therefore struggle to detect
these implicit cues. Fine-tuning approaches, while effective to some extent,
risk degrading the model's generative quality, creating an undesirable
trade-off. To address this, we propose NDM, the first noise-driven detection
and mitigation framework, which could detect and mitigate implicit malicious
intention in T2I generation while preserving the model's original generative
capabilities. Specifically, we introduce two key innovations: first, we
leverage the separability of early-stage predicted noise to develop a
noise-based detection method that could identify malicious content with high
accuracy and efficiency; second, we propose a noise-enhanced adaptive negative
guidance mechanism that could optimize the initial noise by suppressing the
prominent region's attention, thereby enhancing the effectiveness of adaptive
negative guidance for sexual mitigation. Experimentally, we validate NDM on
both natural and adversarial datasets, demonstrating its superior performance
over existing SOTA methods, including SLD, UCE, and RECE, etc. Code and
resources are available at https://github.com/lorraine021/NDM.

Motivation: 当获取精细像素级标注困难或昂贵时，粗标注成为替代方案，但边界对齐效果不佳

Method: 在编码器-解码器架构中引入基于SLIC超像素的正则化，鼓励解码后的分割结果与基于颜色和位置的超像素对齐

Result: 在SUIM、Cityscapes和PanNuke数据集上评估，边界召回率相比最先进模型显著提升

Conclusion: 该方法能有效利用粗标注训练分割模型，特别在边界对齐方面表现优异

Abstract: Semantic segmentation is the task of classifying each pixel in an image.
Training a segmentation model achieves best results using annotated images,
where each pixel is annotated with the corresponding class. When obtaining fine
annotations is difficult or expensive, it may be possible to acquire coarse
annotations, e.g. by roughly annotating pixels in an images leaving some pixels
around the boundaries between classes unlabeled. Segmentation with coarse
annotations is difficult, in particular when the objective is to optimize the
alignment of boundaries between classes. This paper proposes a regularization
method for models with an encoder-decoder architecture with superpixel based
upsampling. It encourages the segmented pixels in the decoded image to be
SLIC-superpixels, which are based on pixel color and position, independent of
the segmentation annotation. The method is applied to FCN-16 fully
convolutional network architecture and evaluated on the SUIM, Cityscapes, and
PanNuke data sets. It is shown that the boundary recall improves significantly
compared to state-of-the-art models when trained on coarse annotations.

Motivation: 解决潜在扩散模型中高频细节保真度不足和罕见激活峰值的问题，提升低步数和高分辨率下的图像质量。

Method: 结合每样本微钳位（温和限制极端值）和自适应分位数裁剪（AQClip），AQClip可使用局部结构统计或注意力熵引导模式来调整允许值范围。

Result: 在SD/SDXL骨干网络上获得更清晰、更锐利的结果，与CFG/Rescale有协同作用，能以可忽略的开销实现超高质量渲染。

Conclusion: QSilk是一个无需训练的高效稳定层，显著提升潜在扩散模型的渲染质量，特别是在低步数和高分辨率场景下。

Abstract: We present QSilk, a lightweight, always-on stabilization layer for latent
diffusion that improves high-frequency fidelity while suppressing rare
activation spikes. QSilk combines (i) a per-sample micro clamp that gently
limits extreme values without washing out texture, and (ii) Adaptive Quantile
Clip (AQClip), which adapts the allowed value corridor per region. AQClip can
operate in a proxy mode using local structure statistics or in an attention
entropy guided mode (model confidence). Integrated into the CADE 2.5 rendering
pipeline, QSilk yields cleaner, sharper results at low step counts and
ultra-high resolutions with negligible overhead. It requires no training or
fine-tuning and exposes minimal user controls. We report consistent qualitative
improvements across SD/SDXL backbones and show synergy with CFG/Rescale,
enabling slightly higher guidance without artifacts.

Result: 在三个不同数据集上的实验表明，LDCBM实现了更高的概念和类别准确率，在可解释性和分类性能上均优于先前CBMs。

Conclusion: 通过将概念建立在视觉证据基础上，该方法克服了先前模型的基本限制，增强了可解释AI的可靠性。

Abstract: Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) enhance interpretability by predicting
human-understandable concepts as intermediate representations. However,
existing CBMs often suffer from input-to-concept mapping bias and limited
controllability, which restricts their practical value, directly damage the
responsibility of strategy from concept-based methods. We propose a lightweight
Disentangled Concept Bottleneck Model (LDCBM) that automatically groups visual
features into semantically meaningful components without region annotation. By
introducing a filter grouping loss and joint concept supervision, our method
improves the alignment between visual patterns and concepts, enabling more
transparent and robust decision-making. Notably, Experiments on three diverse
datasets demonstrate that LDCBM achieves higher concept and class accuracy,
outperforming previous CBMs in both interpretability and classification
performance. By grounding concepts in visual evidence, our method overcomes a
fundamental limitation of prior models and enhances the reliability of
interpretable AI.

Abstract: The scale and quality of datasets are crucial for training robust perception
models. However, obtaining large-scale annotated data is both costly and
time-consuming. Generative models have emerged as a powerful tool for data
augmentation by synthesizing samples that adhere to desired distributions.
However, current generative approaches often rely on complex post-processing or
extensive fine-tuning on massive datasets to achieve satisfactory results, and
they remain prone to content-position mismatches and semantic leakage. To
overcome these limitations, we introduce ReCon, a novel augmentation framework
that enhances the capacity of structure-controllable generative models for
object detection. ReCon integrates region-guided rectification into the
diffusion sampling process, using feedback from a pre-trained perception model
to rectify misgenerated regions within diffusion sampling process. We further
propose region-aligned cross-attention to enforce spatial-semantic alignment
between image regions and their textual cues, thereby improving both semantic
consistency and overall image fidelity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
ReCon substantially improve the quality and trainability of generated data,
achieving consistent performance gains across various datasets, backbone
architectures, and data scales. Our code is available at

Motivation: 解决非刚性变形点云配准中的两个关键挑战：(i) 由于配准目标的非凸性导致的局部最小值问题，特别是在噪声或部分输入下；(ii) 长序列中的误差累积导致跟踪失败

Method: 采用可扩展的数据驱动方法，通过两阶段管道预测变形图序列：首先估计帧级粗粒度图节点进行鲁棒初始化，然后在滑动窗口方式下随时间细化其轨迹

Result: 在DeformingThings4D和D-FAUST数据集上优于先前最先进方法，相比先前最佳方法实现了4倍以上的加速

Conclusion: ERNet能够有效处理噪声和部分输入，同时利用时间信息进行准确一致的序列配准，在准确性和效率方面均有显著提升

Abstract: Registering an object shape to a sequence of point clouds undergoing
non-rigid deformation is a long-standing challenge. The key difficulties stem
from two factors: (i) the presence of local minima due to the non-convexity of
registration objectives, especially under noisy or partial inputs, which
hinders accurate and robust deformation estimation, and (ii) error accumulation
over long sequences, leading to tracking failures. To address these challenges,
we introduce to adopt a scalable data-driven approach and propose ERNet, an
efficient feed-forward model trained on large deformation datasets. It is
designed to handle noisy and partial inputs while effectively leveraging
temporal information for accurate and consistent sequential registration. The
key to our design is predicting a sequence of deformation graphs through a
two-stage pipeline, which first estimates frame-wise coarse graph nodes for
robust initialization, before refining their trajectories over time in a
sliding-window fashion. Extensive experiments show that our proposed approach
(i) outperforms previous state-of-the-art on both the DeformingThings4D and
D-FAUST datasets, and (ii) achieves more than 4x speedup compared to the
previous best, offering significant efficiency improvement.

Motivation: 现有文本到视频生成方法严重依赖精确的用户提示，而现有的测试时优化方法难以处理视频的多方面特性

Method: 使用多代理系统：将用户想法分解为结构化时间计划，通过成对锦标赛选择最佳视频，由视觉、音频和上下文保真度专业代理进行批评，推理代理综合反馈重写提示

Result: 在单场景和多场景视频生成实验中，VISTA持续改进视频质量和用户意图对齐，相比最先进基线方法获得高达60%的成对胜率，人类评估者在66.4%的比较中偏好VISTA输出

Conclusion: VISTA通过自主迭代改进机制，显著提升了文本到视频生成的质量和用户意图对齐，在多场景视频生成中表现尤为突出

Abstract: Despite rapid advances in text-to-video synthesis, generated video quality
remains critically dependent on precise user prompts. Existing test-time
optimization methods, successful in other domains, struggle with the
multi-faceted nature of video. In this work, we introduce VISTA (Video
Iterative Self-improvemenT Agent), a novel multi-agent system that autonomously
improves video generation through refining prompts in an iterative loop. VISTA
first decomposes a user idea into a structured temporal plan. After generation,
the best video is identified through a robust pairwise tournament. This winning
video is then critiqued by a trio of specialized agents focusing on visual,
audio, and contextual fidelity. Finally, a reasoning agent synthesizes this
feedback to introspectively rewrite and enhance the prompt for the next
generation cycle. Experiments on single- and multi-scene video generation
scenarios show that while prior methods yield inconsistent gains, VISTA
consistently improves video quality and alignment with user intent, achieving
up to 60% pairwise win rate against state-of-the-art baselines. Human
evaluators concur, preferring VISTA outputs in 66.4% of comparisons.

Abstract: Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation (OVSS) assigns pixel-level labels from
an open set of categories, requiring generalization to unseen and unlabelled
objects. Using vision-language models (VLMs) to correlate local image patches
with potential unseen object categories suffers from a lack of understanding of
spatial relations of objects in a scene. To solve this problem, we introduce
neuro-symbolic (NeSy) spatial reasoning in OVSS. In contrast to contemporary
VLM correlation-based approaches, we propose Relational Segmentor (RelateSeg)
to impose explicit spatial relational constraints by first order logic (FOL)
formulated in a neural network architecture. This is the first attempt to
explore NeSy spatial reasoning in OVSS. Specifically, RelateSeg automatically
extracts spatial relations, e.g., <cat, to-right-of, person>, and encodes them
as first-order logic formulas using our proposed pseudo categories. Each pixel
learns to predict both a semantic category (e.g., "cat") and a spatial pseudo
category (e.g., "right of person") simultaneously, enforcing relational
constraints (e.g., a "cat" pixel must lie to the right of a "person"). Finally,
these logic constraints are formulated in a deep network architecture by fuzzy
logic relaxation, enabling end-to-end learning of spatial-relationally
consistent segmentation. RelateSeg achieves state-of-the-art performance in
terms of average mIoU across four benchmark datasets and particularly shows
clear advantages on images containing multiple categories, with the cost of
only introducing a single auxiliary loss function and no additional parameters,
validating the effectiveness of NeSy spatial reasoning in OVSS.

TL;DR: 3DPR是一个基于图像的重新光照模型，利用从光舞台捕获的多视图单光源图像学习生成先验，结合预训练生成头部模型的几何先验，实现高质量的人脸重新光照。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统图形学方法通过可微分渲染将输入图像分解为几何、材质和光照，但受限于底层模型的假设和近似。需要更准确的方法来渲染新颖视角和重新光照的人头图像。

Method: 首先将输入肖像嵌入预训练生成头部模型的潜在空间，然后使用基于triplane的反射率网络合成高质量OLAT图像，最终根据HDRI环境图组合生成物理准确的重新光照结果。

Result: 3DPR在定量和定性评估中优于先前方法，特别是在保持身份特征和捕捉光照效果（如镜面反射、自阴影和次表面散射）方面表现优异。

Conclusion: 该方法通过结合生成几何先验和光舞台数据训练的反射率网络，实现了高质量的人脸重新光照，解决了单目输入下渲染新颖视角和重新光照的欠约束问题。

Abstract: Rendering novel, relit views of a human head, given a monocular portrait
image as input, is an inherently underconstrained problem. The traditional
graphics solution is to explicitly decompose the input image into geometry,
material and lighting via differentiable rendering; but this is constrained by
the multiple assumptions and approximations of the underlying models and
parameterizations of these scene components. We propose 3DPR, an image-based
relighting model that leverages generative priors learnt from multi-view
One-Light-at-A-Time (OLAT) images captured in a light stage. We introduce a new
diverse and large-scale multi-view 4K OLAT dataset of 139 subjects to learn a
high-quality prior over the distribution of high-frequency face reflectance. We
leverage the latent space of a pre-trained generative head model that provides
a rich prior over face geometry learnt from in-the-wild image datasets. The
input portrait is first embedded in the latent manifold of such a model through
an encoder-based inversion process. Then a novel triplane-based reflectance
network trained on our lightstage data is used to synthesize high-fidelity OLAT
images to enable image-based relighting. Our reflectance network operates in
the latent space of the generative head model, crucially enabling a relatively
small number of lightstage images to train the reflectance model. Combining the
generated OLATs according to a given HDRI environment maps yields physically
accurate environmental relighting results. Through quantitative and qualitative
evaluations, we demonstrate that 3DPR outperforms previous methods,
particularly in preserving identity and in capturing lighting effects such as
specularities, self-shadows, and subsurface scattering. Project Page:

TL;DR: 提出Memory-SAM，一种无需训练、无需人工提示的舌象分割方法，通过检索历史案例自动生成有效提示来指导SAM2模型，在真实场景下显著优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统监督模型需要大量标注数据，而SAM系列模型仍需人工提示。需要开发一种无需训练和人工干预的自动舌象分割方法。

Method: 使用DINOv3特征和FAISS检索构建小型记忆库，通过掩码约束对应关系提取前景/背景点提示，自动指导SAM2进行分割。

Result: 在600张专家标注图像上测试，Memory-SAM达到mIoU 0.9863，远超FCN(0.8188)和检测器到框SAM基线(0.1839)，在真实场景下表现尤为突出。

Conclusion: 检索到提示的方法能够实现数据高效、鲁棒的舌象不规则边界分割，为中医舌诊分析提供可靠工具。

Abstract: Accurate tongue segmentation is crucial for reliable TCM analysis. Supervised
models require large annotated datasets, while SAM-family models remain
prompt-driven. We present Memory-SAM, a training-free, human-prompt-free
pipeline that automatically generates effective prompts from a small memory of
prior cases via dense DINOv3 features and FAISS retrieval. Given a query image,
mask-constrained correspondences to the retrieved exemplar are distilled into
foreground/background point prompts that guide SAM2 without manual clicks or
model fine-tuning. We evaluate on 600 expert-annotated images (300 controlled,
300 in-the-wild). On the mixed test split, Memory-SAM achieves mIoU 0.9863,
surpassing FCN (0.8188) and a detector-to-box SAM baseline (0.1839). On
controlled data, ceiling effects above 0.98 make small differences less
meaningful given annotation variability, while our method shows clear gains
under real-world conditions. Results indicate that retrieval-to-prompt enables
data-efficient, robust segmentation of irregular boundaries in tongue imaging.

Motivation: 推动原生图像生成的前沿发展，将文本到图像生成和图像编辑统一在单一架构中，解决图像编辑这一挑战性任务。

Method: 采用自回归+扩散混合架构：自回归模型首先生成离散图像token，其隐藏状态作为扩散模型的调节信号来生成高保真图像。

Result: 在各种文本到图像和图像编辑基准测试中，BLIP3o-NEXT实现了优于现有模型的性能表现。

Conclusion: 架构选择的关键在于可扩展性和快速推理能力；强化学习能推动原生图像生成；数据质量和规模决定模型性能上限；自回归+扩散架构结合了推理能力和细节渲染优势。

Abstract: We present BLIP3o-NEXT, a fully open-source foundation model in the BLIP3
series that advances the next frontier of native image generation. BLIP3o-NEXT
unifies text-to-image generation and image editing within a single
architecture, demonstrating strong image generation and image editing
capabilities. In developing the state-of-the-art native image generation model,
we identify four key insights: (1) Most architectural choices yield comparable
performance; an architecture can be deemed effective provided it scales
efficiently and supports fast inference; (2) The successful application of
reinforcement learning can further push the frontier of native image
generation; (3) Image editing still remains a challenging task, yet instruction
following and the consistency between generated and reference images can be
significantly enhanced through post-training and data engine; (4) Data quality
and scale continue to be decisive factors that determine the upper bound of
model performance. Building upon these insights, BLIP3o-NEXT leverages an
Autoregressive + Diffusion architecture in which an autoregressive model first
generates discrete image tokens conditioned on multimodal inputs, whose hidden
states are then used as conditioning signals for a diffusion model to generate
high-fidelity images. This architecture integrates the reasoning strength and
instruction following of autoregressive models with the fine-detail rendering
ability of diffusion models, achieving a new level of coherence and realism.
Extensive evaluations of various text-to-image and image-editing benchmarks
show that BLIP3o-NEXT achieves superior performance over existing models.

Motivation: 解决生物医学视觉语言模型在临床应用中因提示优化技术产生不可解释的潜在向量或单一文本提示而缺乏透明度的问题，这些限制影响了在高风险医疗环境中的可信度。

Method: 使用大语言模型作为生物医学知识提取器和自适应优化器，通过进化框架自动生成多样化的可解释自然语言提示对。

Result: 在多个生物医学基准测试中，BiomedXPro始终优于最先进的提示调优方法，特别是在数据稀缺的少样本设置中表现突出。

Conclusion: BiomedXPro通过生成多样化的可解释提示集合，为模型预测提供了可验证的基础，是开发更可信和临床对齐AI系统的重要一步。

Abstract: The clinical adoption of biomedical vision-language models is hindered by
prompt optimization techniques that produce either uninterpretable latent
vectors or single textual prompts. This lack of transparency and failure to
capture the multi-faceted nature of clinical diagnosis, which relies on
integrating diverse observations, limits their trustworthiness in high-stakes
settings. To address this, we introduce BiomedXPro, an evolutionary framework
that leverages a large language model as both a biomedical knowledge extractor
and an adaptive optimizer to automatically generate a diverse ensemble of
interpretable, natural-language prompt pairs for disease diagnosis. Experiments
on multiple biomedical benchmarks show that BiomedXPro consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art prompt-tuning methods, particularly in data-scarce few-shot
settings. Furthermore, our analysis demonstrates a strong semantic alignment
between the discovered prompts and statistically significant clinical features,
grounding the model's performance in verifiable concepts. By producing a
diverse ensemble of interpretable prompts, BiomedXPro provides a verifiable
basis for model predictions, representing a critical step toward the
development of more trustworthy and clinically-aligned AI systems.

Abstract: Synthesizing large-scale, explorable, and geometrically accurate 3D urban
scenes is a challenging yet valuable task in providing immersive and embodied
applications. The challenges lie in the lack of large-scale and high-quality
real-world 3D scans for training generalizable generative models. In this
paper, we take an alternative route to create large-scale 3D scenes by
synergizing the readily available satellite imagery that supplies realistic
coarse geometry and the open-domain diffusion model for creating high-quality
close-up appearances. We propose \textbf{Skyfall-GS}, the first city-block
scale 3D scene creation framework without costly 3D annotations, also featuring
real-time, immersive 3D exploration. We tailor a curriculum-driven iterative
refinement strategy to progressively enhance geometric completeness and
photorealistic textures. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Skyfall-GS
provides improved cross-view consistent geometry and more realistic textures
compared to state-of-the-art approaches. Project page:

Abstract: Advancing machine intelligence requires developing the ability to perceive

OmniVinci, an initiative to build a strong, open-source, omni-modal LLM. We
carefully study the design choices across model architecture and data curation.
For model architecture, we present three key innovations: (i) OmniAlignNet for
strengthening alignment between vision and audio embeddings in a shared
omni-modal latent space; (ii) Temporal Embedding Grouping for capturing
relative temporal alignment between vision and audio signals; and (iii)
Constrained Rotary Time Embedding for encoding absolute temporal information in
omni-modal embeddings. We introduce a curation and synthesis pipeline that
generates 24M single-modal and omni-modal conversations. We find that
modalities reinforce one another in both perception and reasoning. Our model,
OmniVinci, outperforms Qwen2.5-Omni with +19.05 on DailyOmni (cross-modal
understanding), +1.7 on MMAR (audio), and +3.9 on Video-MME (vision), while
using just 0.2T training tokens - a 6 times reduction compared to
Qwen2.5-Omni's 1.2T. We finally demonstrate omni-modal advantages in downstream
applications spanning robotics, medical AI, and smart factory.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 可持续能源发展增加了电力负荷的不确定性，输电系统运营商需要更高空间分辨率的负荷预测，从区域聚合扩展到单个节点，但节点负荷预测准确性较低且管理困难。

Method: 设计多级预测系统，使用区域和节点净负荷数据集，开发可解释且可扩展的预测模型，通过完全并行化的单模型预测工作流程管理节点负荷的异质性和波动性。

Result: 区域预测的准确性和可解释性得到改善，节点预测有显著改进，运营商能够以前所未有的置信度和准确性调整预测，并精确诊断不透明的错误。

Conclusion: 多级预测系统使运营商能够逐步将区域运营扩展到节点预测，在准确性和可解释性方面均有显著提升，为电网可靠性提供重要支持。

Abstract: The reliability of local power grid infrastructure is challenged by
sustainable energy developments increasing electric load uncertainty.
Transmission System Operators (TSOs) need load forecasts of higher spatial
resolution, extending current forecasting operations from zonal aggregates to
individual nodes. However, nodal loads are less accurate to forecast and
require a large number of individual forecasts, which are hard to manage for
the human experts assessing risks in the control room's daily operations
(operator). In collaboration with a TSO, we design a multi-level system that
meets the needs of operators for hourly day-ahead load forecasting. Utilizing a
uniquely extensive dataset of zonal and nodal net loads, we experimentally
evaluate our system components. First, we develop an interpretable and scalable
forecasting model that allows for TSOs to gradually extend zonal operations to
include nodal forecasts. Second, we evaluate solutions to address the
heterogeneity and volatility of nodal load, subject to a trade-off. Third, our
system is manageable with a fully parallelized single-model forecasting
workflow. Our results show accuracy and interpretability improvements for zonal
forecasts, and substantial improvements for nodal forecasts. In practice, our
multi-level forecasting system allows operators to adjust forecasts with
unprecedented confidence and accuracy, and to diagnose otherwise opaque errors
precisely.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统特征选择方法主要关注预测准确性，但在存在相关预测因子的情况下性能会下降，需要一种能够处理相关特征空间的方法。

Method: TangledFeatures框架识别相关特征组中的代表性特征，减少冗余同时保持解释能力。

Result: 在Alanine Dipeptide数据集上应用该框架预测骨架扭转角，所选特征对应于结构上有意义的原子间距离，能够解释这些角度的变化。

Conclusion: TangledFeatures提供比传统选择技术更可解释和稳定的分析基础，可直接应用于下游模型。

Abstract: Feature selection is a fundamental step in model development, shaping both
predictive performance and interpretability. Yet, most widely used methods
focus on predictive accuracy, and their performance degrades in the presence of
correlated predictors. To address this gap, we introduce TangledFeatures, a
framework for feature selection in correlated feature spaces. It identifies
representative features from groups of entangled predictors, reducing
redundancy while retaining explanatory power. The resulting feature subset can
be directly applied in downstream models, offering a more interpretable and
stable basis for analysis compared to traditional selection techniques. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of TangledFeatures on Alanine Dipeptide, applying
it to the prediction of backbone torsional angles and show that the selected
features correspond to structurally meaningful intra-atomic distances that
explain variation in these angles.

TL;DR: 本研究提出了ES-C51算法，将C51分布强化学习中的贪婪Q学习更新替换为Expected Sarsa更新，使用softmax结合所有可能动作的信息，解决了当动作具有相似期望奖励但不同分布时的不稳定性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于价值的RL算法只估计期望奖励，而分布强化学习估计整个奖励概率分布。但C51算法使用贪婪Bellman更新，当多个动作具有相似期望奖励但不同分布时，会导致分布学习不稳定。

Method: 修改C51算法，用Expected Sarsa更新替代贪婪Q学习更新，使用softmax计算结合所有可能动作的信息，而不是依赖单一最佳动作。同时将标准C51的探索策略从ε-greedy改为softmax作为公平比较基准。

Result: 在Gym经典控制环境和Atari-10游戏中评估，ES-C51在多数环境中表现优于QL-C51（修改后的标准C51）。

Conclusion: ES-C51通过Expected Sarsa更新有效解决了分布学习不稳定性问题，能够学习到更高性能的策略，在多个环境中优于传统C51方法。

Abstract: In most value-based reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms, the agent
estimates only the expected reward for each action and selects the action with
the highest reward. In contrast, Distributional Reinforcement Learning (DRL)
estimates the entire probability distribution of possible rewards, providing
richer information about uncertainty and variability. C51 is a popular DRL
algorithm for discrete action spaces. It uses a Q-learning approach, where the
distribution is learned using a greedy Bellman update. However, this can cause
problems if multiple actions at a state have similar expected reward but with
different distributions, as the algorithm may not learn a stable distribution.
This study presents a modified version of C51 (ES-C51) that replaces the greedy
Q-learning update with an Expected Sarsa update, which uses a softmax
calculation to combine information from all possible actions at a state rather
than relying on a single best action. This reduces instability when actions
have similar expected rewards and allows the agent to learn higher-performing
policies. This approach is evaluated on classic control environments from Gym,
and Atari-10 games. For a fair comparison, we modify the standard C51's
exploration strategy from e-greedy to softmax, which we refer to as QL-C51 (Q-
Learning based C51). The results demonstrate that ES-C51 outperforms QL-C51
across many environments.

Abstract: Wind turbine reliability is critical to the growing renewable energy sector,
where early fault detection significantly reduces downtime and maintenance
costs. This paper introduces a novel ensemble-based deep learning framework for
unsupervised anomaly detection in wind turbines. The method integrates
Variational Autoencoders (VAE), LSTM Autoencoders, and Transformer
architectures, each capturing different temporal and contextual patterns from
high-dimensional SCADA data. A unique feature engineering pipeline extracts
temporal, statistical, and frequency-domain indicators, which are then
processed by the deep models. Ensemble scoring combines model predictions,
followed by adaptive thresholding to detect operational anomalies without
requiring labeled fault data. Evaluated on the CARE dataset containing 89 years
of real-world turbine data across three wind farms, the proposed method
achieves an AUC-ROC of 0.947 and early fault detection up to 48 hours prior to
failure. This approach offers significant societal value by enabling predictive
maintenance, reducing turbine failures, and enhancing operational efficiency in
large-scale wind energy deployments.

Abstract: Crashworthiness assessment is a critical aspect of automotive design,
traditionally relying on high-fidelity finite element (FE) simulations that are
computationally expensive and time-consuming. This work presents an exploratory
comparative study on developing machine learning-based surrogate models for
efficient prediction of structural deformation in crash scenarios using the
NVIDIA PhysicsNeMo framework. Given the limited prior work applying machine
learning to structural crash dynamics, the primary contribution lies in
demonstrating the feasibility and engineering utility of the various modeling
approaches explored in this work. We investigate two state-of-the-art neural
network architectures for modeling crash dynamics: MeshGraphNet, and
Transolver. Additionally, we examine three strategies for modeling transient
dynamics: time-conditional, the standard Autoregressive approach, and a
stability-enhanced Autoregressive scheme incorporating rollout-based training.
The models are evaluated on a comprehensive Body-in-White (BIW) crash dataset
comprising 150 detailed FE simulations using LS-DYNA. The dataset represents a
structurally rich vehicle assembly with over 200 components, including 38 key
components featuring variable thickness distributions to capture realistic
manufacturing variability. Each model utilizes the undeformed mesh geometry and
component characteristics as inputs to predict the spatiotemporal evolution of
the deformed mesh during the crash sequence. Evaluation results show that the
models capture the overall deformation trends with reasonable fidelity,
demonstrating the feasibility of applying machine learning to structural crash
dynamics. Although not yet matching full FE accuracy, the models achieve
orders-of-magnitude reductions in computational cost, enabling rapid design
exploration and early-stage optimization in crashworthiness evaluation.

Conclusion: AlignFlow通过SDOT方法有效解决了流式生成模型在大规模数据集上的可扩展性问题，显著提升了模型性能，是一种高效且通用的增强方法。

Abstract: Flow-based Generative Models (FGMs) effectively transform noise into complex
data distributions. Incorporating Optimal Transport (OT) to couple noise and
data during FGM training has been shown to improve the straightness of flow
trajectories, enabling more effective inference. However, existing OT-based
methods estimate the OT plan using (mini-)batches of sampled noise and data
points, which limits their scalability to large and high-dimensional datasets
in FGMs. This paper introduces AlignFlow, a novel approach that leverages
Semi-Discrete Optimal Transport (SDOT) to enhance the training of FGMs by
establishing an explicit, optimal alignment between noise distribution and data
points with guaranteed convergence. SDOT computes a transport map by
partitioning the noise space into Laguerre cells, each mapped to a
corresponding data point. During FGM training, i.i.d. noise samples are paired
with data points via the SDOT map. AlignFlow scales well to large datasets and
model architectures with negligible computational overhead. Experimental
results show that AlignFlow improves the performance of a wide range of
state-of-the-art FGM algorithms and can be integrated as a plug-and-play
component. Code is available at: https://github.com/konglk1203/AlignFlow.

TL;DR: 提出KME-CLIP方法，通过再生核希尔伯特空间的内积来改进CLIP中的相似度计算机制，更好地利用点互信息的线性结构


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CLIP及其变体未能充分利用点互信息(PMI)的线性结构，而理论研究表明跨模态相似度度量应与PMI对应

Method: 在再生核希尔伯特空间中使用内积来近似PMI，理论上可以任意精度逼近点互信息

Result: 在多个检索和分类任务中，KME-CLIP整体优于标准CLIP方法

Conclusion: 通过利用PMI的线性结构，KME-CLIP能够更有效地计算跨模态相似度，提升多模态对比预训练性能

Abstract: In this study, we propose an enhancement to the similarity computation
mechanism in multi-modal contrastive pretraining frameworks such as CLIP. Prior
theoretical research has demonstrated that the optimal similarity metrics
between paired modalities should correspond to the pointwise mutual information
(PMI) between the two modalities. However, the current implementations of CLIP
and its variants fail to fully utilize the underlying linear structure of PMI.
We therefore propose KME-CLIP, which leverages this structure through the inner
product in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. We theoretically prove that our
method can approximate PMI with arbitrary accuracy and empirically demonstrate
that our approach overall outperforms the standard CLIP formulation across
several retrieval and classification tasks.

Motivation: 量子机器学习在金融服务中具有潜力，但其黑盒特性在需要透明度和信任的信用评分领域面临挑战，需要开发可解释的QML模型。

Method: 提出IQNN-CS框架，结合变分量子神经网络和针对结构化数据的后验解释技术，引入Inter-Class Attribution Alignment(ICAA)指标来量化不同预测类别间的归因差异。

Result: 在两个真实信用数据集上的评估显示，IQNN-CS具有稳定的训练动态、有竞争力的预测性能和增强的可解释性。

Conclusion: 该工作为金融决策提供了透明和可问责的量子机器学习模型的实用路径。

Abstract: Credit scoring is a high-stakes task in financial services, where model
decisions directly impact individuals' access to credit and are subject to
strict regulatory scrutiny. While Quantum Machine Learning (QML) offers new
computational capabilities, its black-box nature poses challenges for adoption
in domains that demand transparency and trust. In this work, we present
IQNN-CS, an interpretable quantum neural network framework designed for
multiclass credit risk classification. The architecture combines a variational
QNN with a suite of post-hoc explanation techniques tailored for structured
data. To address the lack of structured interpretability in QML, we introduce
Inter-Class Attribution Alignment (ICAA), a novel metric that quantifies
attribution divergence across predicted classes, revealing how the model
distinguishes between credit risk categories. Evaluated on two real-world
credit datasets, IQNN-CS demonstrates stable training dynamics, competitive
predictive performance, and enhanced interpretability. Our results highlight a
practical path toward transparent and accountable QML models for financial
decision-making.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有算子学习方法忽视PDE的领域知识，导致难以捕捉时间动态且在训练时间范围外泛化能力差。

Method: 采用编码器-解码器架构：编码器进行空间离散化，神经ODE捕捉潜在时间动态，解码器重构物理空间解。提出物理编码神经ODE来融入PDE特定物理属性。

Result: 在非线性扩散-反应和Navier-Stokes方程上的数值实验显示高精度、计算效率和在训练时间范围外的预测能力。

Conclusion: 该框架具有适应不同编码器/解码器的灵活性，能够跨相关PDE族泛化，是科学机器学习中可扩展的物理编码工具。

Abstract: Operator learning has emerged as a promising paradigm for developing
efficient surrogate models to solve partial differential equations (PDEs).
However, existing approaches often overlook the domain knowledge inherent in
the underlying PDEs and hence suffer from challenges in capturing temporal
dynamics and generalization issues beyond training time frames. This paper
introduces a deep neural ordinary differential equation (ODE) operator network
framework, termed NODE-ONet, to alleviate these limitations. The framework
adopts an encoder-decoder architecture comprising three core components: an
encoder that spatially discretizes input functions, a neural ODE capturing
latent temporal dynamics, and a decoder reconstructing solutions in physical
spaces. Theoretically, error analysis for the encoder-decoder architecture is
investigated. Computationally, we propose novel physics-encoded neural ODEs to
incorporate PDE-specific physical properties. Such well-designed neural ODEs
significantly reduce the framework's complexity while enhancing numerical
efficiency, robustness, applicability, and generalization capacity. Numerical
experiments on nonlinear diffusion-reaction and Navier-Stokes equations
demonstrate high accuracy, computational efficiency, and prediction
capabilities beyond training time frames. Additionally, the framework's
flexibility to accommodate diverse encoders/decoders and its ability to
generalize across related PDE families further underscore its potential as a
scalable, physics-encoded tool for scientific machine learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM智能体在分布外场景中表现不佳，难以将内部知识与复杂动态环境对齐，传统RL训练难以扩展

Method: SPA框架：将世界模型分解为状态表示和转移建模，通过自监督微调阶段学习世界模型，然后在策略优化前模拟未来状态

Result: 在Sokoban、FrozenLake和Sudoku等环境中显著提升性能，Sokoban成功率从25.6%提升至59.8%，FrozenLake得分从22.1%提升至70.9%

Conclusion: 为LLM智能体配备内部世界模型能更好地对齐推理与环境动态，改善决策能力，SPA框架有效提升了RL智能体训练性能

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) as agents often struggle in out-of-distribution
(OOD) scenarios. Real-world environments are complex and dynamic, governed by
task-specific rules and stochasticity, which makes it difficult for LLMs to
ground their internal knowledge in those dynamics. Under such OOD conditions,
vanilla RL training often fails to scale; we observe Pass@k--the probability
that at least one of (k) sampled trajectories succeeds--drops markedly across
training steps, indicating brittle exploration and limited generalization.
Inspired by model-based reinforcement learning, we hypothesize that equipping
LLM agents with an internal world model can better align reasoning with
environmental dynamics and improve decision-making. We show how to encode this
world model by decomposing it into two components: state representation and
transition modeling. Building on this, we introduce SPA, a simple reinforcement
learning framework that cold-starts the policy via a Self-Play supervised
finetuning (SFT) stage to learn the world model by interacting with the
environment, then uses it to simulate future states prior to policy
optimization. This simple initialization outperforms the online world-modeling
baseline and greatly boosts the RL-based agent training performance.
Experiments across diverse environments like Sokoban, FrozenLake, and Sudoku
show that our approach significantly improves performance. For example, SPA
boosts the Sokoban success rate from 25.6% to 59.8% and raises the FrozenLake
score from 22.1% to 70.9% for the Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct model.

Motivation: 传统强化学习假设环境是给定或固定的，但现实中的智能体可能具有主动修改环境模型的能力。通过模型改变动作重新配置底层转移过程，有可能提高智能体的奖励。

Method: 引入多层级可配置时变马尔可夫决策过程(MCTVMDP)，包含上层模型改变动作和下层原始动作。底层MDP具有可通过上层动作配置的非平稳转移函数。

Result: 提出了一个框架，使智能体能够同时优化上层配置策略和下层原始动作策略，共同改进期望长期奖励。

Conclusion: MCTVMDP为具有主动环境修改能力的智能体提供了一个理论框架，扩展了传统强化学习的被动适应范式。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning usually assumes a given or sometimes even fixed
environment in which an agent seeks an optimal policy to maximize its long-term
discounted reward. In contrast, we consider agents that are not limited to
passive adaptations: they instead have model-changing actions that actively
modify the RL model of world dynamics itself. Reconfiguring the underlying
transition processes can potentially increase the agents' rewards. Motivated by
this setting, we introduce the multi-layer configurable time-varying Markov
decision process (MCTVMDP). In an MCTVMDP, the lower-level MDP has a
non-stationary transition function that is configurable through upper-level
model-changing actions. The agent's objective consists of two parts: Optimize
the configuration policies in the upper-level MDP and optimize the primitive
action policies in the lower-level MDP to jointly improve its expected
long-term reward.

TL;DR: Antislop框架通过采样器、自动化管道和FTPO微调方法，有效检测和消除LLM输出中的重复短语模式，在保持性能的同时显著减少slop现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM广泛采用导致输出中出现特征性的重复短语模式（称为slop），这会降低输出质量并使AI生成文本容易被识别。

Method: 结合三种创新方法：Antislop采样器（使用回溯抑制不需要的字符串）、自动化管道（分析模型特定slop并生成训练数据）、FTPO微调方法（在单个token级别调整logits）。

Result: 成功抑制8000+个模式，而token禁止方法在2000个模式时就失效；FTPO实现90%的slop减少，同时在GSM8K、MMLU和创意写作任务中保持或提升性能。

Conclusion: Antislop框架能有效解决LLM输出中的slop问题，FTPO方法在保持模型性能的同时显著减少重复模式，优于DPO方法。

Abstract: Widespread LLM adoption has introduced characteristic repetitive phraseology,
termed ``slop,'' which degrades output quality and makes AI-generated text
immediately recognizable. We present Antislop, a comprehensive framework
providing tools to both detect and eliminate these overused patterns. Our
approach combines three innovations: (1) The Antislop Sampler, which uses
backtracking to suppress unwanted strings at inference time without destroying
vocabulary; (2) An automated pipeline that profiles model-specific slop against
human baselines and generates training data; (3) Final Token Preference
Optimization (FTPO), a novel fine-tuning method that operates on individual
tokens, surgically adjusting logits wherever a banned pattern has appeared in
an inference trace. We demonstrate that some slop patterns appear over
1,000$\times$ more frequently in LLM output than human text. The Antislop
Sampler successfully suppresses 8,000+ patterns while maintaining quality,
whereas token banning becomes unusable at just 2,000. Most importantly, FTPO
achieves 90\% slop reduction while maintaining or improving performance in
cross-domain evals including GSM8K, MMLU, and creative writing tasks. In
contrast, DPO suffers significant degradation in writing quality and lexical
diversity despite achieving weaker suppression. We release all code and results

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前双光子光刻系统的维护主要依赖经验而非基于机器健康状况的监控，导致维护时机不当——要么过早造成不必要停机，要么过晚影响制造质量。

Method: 结合物理信息数据驱动的结构尺寸预测模型与统计方法，提出了三种能够处理不同泛化能力水平复杂场景的健康监测方法。

Result: 在包含6种工艺参数组合和6种结构尺寸的全面实验数据集上测试，所有方法在所有测试场景中都达到了高精度，表现出优异的有效性、鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: 这些结果为双光子光刻系统实现基于状态的维护迈出了重要一步。

Abstract: Two-photon lithography (TPL) is a sophisticated additive manufacturing
technology for creating three-dimensional (3D) micro- and nano-structures.
Maintaining the health of TPL systems is critical for ensuring consistent
fabrication quality. Current maintenance practices often rely on experience
rather than informed monitoring of machine health, resulting in either untimely
maintenance that causes machine downtime and poor-quality fabrication, or
unnecessary maintenance that leads to inefficiencies and avoidable downtime. To
address this gap, this paper presents three methods for accurate and timely
monitoring of TPL machine health. Through integrating physics-informed
data-driven predictive models for structure dimensions with statistical
approaches, the proposed methods are able to handle increasingly complex
scenarios featuring different levels of generalizability. A comprehensive
experimental dataset that encompasses six process parameter combinations and
six structure dimensions under two machine health conditions was collected to
evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approaches. Across all test
scenarios, the approaches are shown to achieve high accuracies, demonstrating
excellent effectiveness, robustness, and generalizability. These results
represent a significant step toward condition-based maintenance for TPL
systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了首个在线相关聚类算法，能在单个聚类中同时近似所有ℓ_p范数目标，将离线"全范数"保证成功迁移到在线设置。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 相关聚类的ℓ_p范数目标在最小化总分歧(ℓ_1范数)和确保个体节点公平性(ℓ_∞范数)之间存在基本权衡。离线设置中可同时近似所有ℓ_p范数，但能否在在线设置中实现这一强大保证尚不清楚。

Method: 提出了一种在线带样本(AOS)模型的单一算法，给定输入的一小部分常数比例作为样本，产生一个聚类，该聚类能同时以高概率在O(log⁴n)竞争比下近似所有ℓ_p范数。

Result: 算法在AOS模型中：对所有ℓ_p范数高概率O(log⁴n)竞争比；对ℓ_∞范数高概率O(logn)竞争比；对ℓ_1范数期望O(1)竞争比。同时证明了在标准随机顺序在线模型中，ℓ_∞范数的竞争比下界为Ω(n^{1/3})。

Conclusion: 成功将离线"全范数"保证迁移到在线世界，证明了AOS模型对于实现公平性目标的重要性，并提供了接近最优的竞争比保证。

Abstract: The $\ell_p$-norm objectives for correlation clustering present a fundamental
trade-off between minimizing total disagreements (the $\ell_1$-norm) and
ensuring fairness to individual nodes (the $\ell_\infty$-norm). Surprisingly,
in the offline setting it is possible to simultaneously approximate all
$\ell_p$-norms with a single clustering. Can this powerful guarantee be
achieved in an online setting? This paper provides the first affirmative
answer. We present a single algorithm for the online-with-a-sample (AOS) model
that, given a small constant fraction of the input as a sample, produces one
clustering that is simultaneously $O(\log^4 n)$-competitive for all
$\ell_p$-norms with high probability, $O(\log n)$-competitive for the
$\ell_\infty$-norm with high probability, and $O(1)$-competitive for the
$\ell_1$-norm in expectation. This work successfully translates the offline
"all-norms" guarantee to the online world.
  Our setting is motivated by a new hardness result that demonstrates a
fundamental separation between these objectives in the standard random-order
(RO) online model. Namely, while the $\ell_1$-norm is trivially
$O(1)$-approximable in the RO model, we prove that any algorithm in the RO
model for the fairness-promoting $\ell_\infty$-norm must have a competitive
ratio of at least $\Omega(n^{1/3})$. This highlights the necessity of a
different beyond-worst-case model. We complement our algorithm with lower
bounds, showing our competitive ratios for the $\ell_1$- and $\ell_\infty$-
norms are nearly tight in the AOS model.

Result: 在三个基准PDE数据集上优于最先进的基线方法，谱分析显示在多尺度动力学恢复方面表现更优，效率研究显示其参数和内存使用比基于注意力或卷积的回归器更轻量。

Conclusion: TempO模型通过流匹配和创新的架构设计，在高维PDE动力学预测中实现了更好的性能、物理一致性和计算效率。

Abstract: Forecasting high-dimensional, PDE-governed dynamics remains a core challenge
for generative modeling. Existing autoregressive and diffusion-based approaches
often suffer cumulative errors and discretisation artifacts that limit long,
physically consistent forecasts. Flow matching offers a natural alternative,
enabling efficient, deterministic sampling. We prove an upper bound on FNO
approximation error and propose TempO, a latent flow matching model leveraging
sparse conditioning with channel folding to efficiently process 3D
spatiotemporal fields using time-conditioned Fourier layers to capture
multi-scale modes with high fidelity. TempO outperforms state-of-the-art
baselines across three benchmark PDE datasets, and spectral analysis further
demonstrates superior recovery of multi-scale dynamics, while efficiency
studies highlight its parameter- and memory-light design compared to
attention-based or convolutional regressors.

Motivation: 现有推理语言模型虽然性能强大，但生成了不必要的冗长输出。如何在保持准确性的同时最大化每个token的智能度（准确率相对于响应长度）是一个开放性问题。

Method: 提出DLER训练方法，结合批量奖励归一化、更高裁剪、动态采样和简单的截断长度惩罚，解决了强化学习优化中的三个关键挑战：优势估计偏差、熵崩溃和稀疏奖励信号。

Result: DLER将输出长度减少了70%以上，同时超越了所有先前基线的准确性。DLER-7B相比DeepSeek-R1-7B，在并行生成多个简洁响应时准确率提高28%，延迟更低。

Conclusion: DLER证明了通过改进强化学习优化而非复杂惩罚机制，可以实现高效的准确率-长度权衡，并提出了难度感知DLER和更新选择性合并方法以进一步提升效率和适用性。

Abstract: Reasoning language models such as OpenAI-o1, DeepSeek-R1, and Qwen achieve
strong performance via extended chains of thought but often generate
unnecessarily long outputs. Maximizing intelligence per token--accuracy
relative to response length--remains an open problem. We revisit reinforcement
learning (RL) with the simplest length penalty--truncation--and show that
accuracy degradation arises not from the lack of sophisticated penalties but
from inadequate RL optimization. We identify three key challenges: (i) large
bias in advantage estimation, (ii) entropy collapse, and (iii) sparse reward
signal. We address them with Doing Length pEnalty Right (DLER), a training
recipe combining batch-wise reward normalization, higher clipping, dynamic
sampling, and a simple truncation length penalty. DLER achieves
state-of-the-art accuracy--efficiency trade-offs, cutting output length by over
70 percent while surpassing all previous baseline accuracy. It also improves
test-time scaling: compared to DeepSeek-R1-7B, DLER-7B generates multiple
concise responses in parallel with 28 percent higher accuracy and lower
latency. We further introduce Difficulty-Aware DLER, which adaptively tightens
truncation on easier questions for additional efficiency gains. We also propose
an update-selective merging method that preserves baseline accuracy while
retaining the concise reasoning ability of the DLER model, which is useful for
scenarios where RL training data is scarce.

Abstract: Identifying the effects of mechanical ventilation strategies and protocols in
critical care requires analyzing data from heterogeneous patient-ventilator
systems within the context of the clinical decision-making environment. This
research develops a framework to help understand the consequences of mechanical
ventilation (MV) and adjunct care decisions on patient outcome from
observations of critical care patients receiving MV. Developing an
understanding of and improving critical care respiratory management requires
the analysis of existing secondary-use clinical data to generate hypotheses
about advantageous variations and adaptations of current care. This work
introduces a perspective of the joint patient-ventilator-care systems
(so-called J6) to develop a scalable method for analyzing data and trajectories
of these complex systems. To that end, breath behaviors are analyzed using
evolutionary game theory (EGT), which generates the necessary quantitative
precursors for deeper analysis through probabilistic and stochastic machinery
such as reinforcement learning. This result is one step along the pathway
toward MV optimization and personalization. The EGT-based process is
analytically validated on synthetic data to reveal potential caveats before
proceeding to real-world ICU data applications that expose complexities of the
data-generating process J6. The discussion includes potential developments
toward a state transition model for the simulating effects of MV decision using
empirical and game-theoretic elements.

TL;DR: 提出一种基于图拉普拉斯算子的非参数概率质量函数估计方法，通过数据依赖的低通滤波来平滑多模态重尾分布，同时保留粗粒度结构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对大离散支撑集上的多模态重尾概率质量函数估计问题，传统方法难以同时处理多模态性和重尾特性，需要一种既能平滑噪声又能保留重要结构的方法。

Method: 将经验PMF视为线图上的信号，构建对称三对角算子（路径图拉普拉斯算子加上基于经验PMF的对角矩阵），计算最小特征值对应的特征向量，将经验PMF投影到低维子空间，最后进行裁剪和重归一化处理。

Result: 在合成和真实的重尾数据上，该方法能有效保留粗粒度结构同时抑制采样噪声，在目标场景下优于logspline和高斯KDE基线方法，计算可靠且运行时间与支撑集大小成正比。

Conclusion: 该方法实现简洁、对不同样本量具有鲁棒性，因其可靠性和速度适用于自动化流程和大规模探索性分析，但存在已知的失败模式（如突然的不连续性）。

Abstract: We study nonparametric estimation of a probability mass function (PMF) on a
large discrete support, where the PMF is multi-modal and heavy-tailed. The core
idea is to treat the empirical PMF as a signal on a line graph and apply a
data-dependent low-pass filter. Concretely, we form a symmetric tri-diagonal
operator, the path graph Laplacian perturbed with a diagonal matrix built from
the empirical PMF, then compute the eigenvectors, corresponding to the smallest
feq eigenvalues. Projecting the empirical PMF onto this low dimensional
subspace produces a smooth, multi-modal estimate that preserves coarse
structure while suppressing noise. A light post-processing step of clipping and
re-normalizing yields a valid PMF.
  Because we compute the eigenpairs of a symmetric tridiagonal matrix, the
computation is reliable and runs time and memory proportional to the support
times the dimension of the desired low-dimensional supspace. We also provide a
practical, data-driven rule for selecting the dimension based on an
orthogonal-series risk estimate, so the method "just works" with minimal
tuning. On synthetic and real heavy-tailed examples, the approach preserves
coarse structure while suppressing sampling noise, compares favorably to
logspline and Gaussian-KDE baselines in the intended regimes. However, it has
known failure modes (e.g., abrupt discontinuities). The method is short to
implement, robust across sample sizes, and suitable for automated pipelines and
exploratory analysis at scale because of its reliability and speed.

Motivation: 研究短期恐怖主义事件预测，使用全球恐怖主义数据库（GTD）构建可复现的预测管道，评估深度学习模型相对于传统方法的性能。

Method: 构建基于固定时间分割的可复现管道，使用双向LSTM（BiLSTM）模型，并与季节性朴素模型、线性/ARIMA模型以及LSTM-Attention基线进行比较。

Abstract: We study short-horizon forecasting of weekly terrorism incident counts using
the Global Terrorism Database (GTD, 1970--2016). We build a reproducible
pipeline with fixed time-based splits and evaluate a Bidirectional LSTM
(BiLSTM) against strong classical anchors (seasonal-naive, linear/ARIMA) and a
deep LSTM-Attention baseline. On the held-out test set, the BiLSTM attains RMSE
6.38, outperforming LSTM-Attention (9.19; +30.6\%) and a linear lag-regression
baseline (+35.4\% RMSE gain), with parallel improvements in MAE and MAPE.
Ablations varying temporal memory, training-history length, spatial grain,
lookback size, and feature groups show that models trained on long historical
data generalize best; a moderate lookback (20--30 weeks) provides strong
context; and bidirectional encoding is critical for capturing both build-up and
aftermath patterns within the window. Feature-group analysis indicates that
short-horizon structure (lagged counts and rolling statistics) contributes
most, with geographic and casualty features adding incremental lift. We release
code, configs, and compact result tables, and provide a data/ethics statement
documenting GTD licensing and research-only use. Overall, the study offers a
transparent, baseline-beating reference for GTD incident forecasting.

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) enables agents to learn optimal decision-making
strategies through interaction with an environment, yet training from scratch
on complex tasks can be highly inefficient. Transfer learning (TL), widely
successful in large language models (LLMs), offers a promising direction for
enhancing RL efficiency by leveraging pre-trained models.
  This paper investigates policy transfer, a TL approach that initializes
learning in a target RL task using a policy from a related source task, in the
context of continuous-time linear quadratic regulators (LQRs) with entropy
regularization. We provide the first theoretical proof of policy transfer for
continuous-time RL, proving that a policy optimal for one LQR serves as a
near-optimal initialization for closely related LQRs, while preserving the
original algorithm's convergence rate. Furthermore, we introduce a novel policy
learning algorithm for continuous-time LQRs that achieves global linear and
local super-linear convergence. Our results demonstrate both theoretical
guarantees and algorithmic benefits of transfer learning in continuous-time RL,
addressing a gap in existing literature and extending prior work from discrete
to continuous time settings.
  As a byproduct of our analysis, we derive the stability of a class of
continuous-time score-based diffusion models via their connection with LQRs.

TL;DR: 该论文通过统计物理学方法推导了双层非线性网络在随机梯度Langevin动力学训练下的贝叶斯后验的均值场理论，揭示了有限宽度网络中特征学习的对称性破缺相变机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 特征学习（神经网络在训练过程中调整内部表示）的机制仍然缺乏深入理解，需要开发可处理的数学理论来揭示其本质。

Method: 使用统计物理学方法推导了双层非线性网络的贝叶斯后验的自洽均值场理论，并分析了随机梯度Langevin动力学训练下的网络行为。

Result: 在无限宽度下理论简化为核岭回归，但在有限宽度下预测了对称性破缺相变，网络会突然与目标函数对齐。基本均值场理论低估了相变后泛化能力的提升，需要引入自增强输入特征选择机制来修正。

Conclusion: 通过将自增强输入特征选择机制纳入均值场理论，能够定量匹配SGLD训练网络的学习曲线，为特征学习提供了机制性理解。

Abstract: Feature learning (FL), where neural networks adapt their internal
representations during training, remains poorly understood. Using methods from
statistical physics, we derive a tractable, self-consistent mean-field (MF)
theory for the Bayesian posterior of two-layer non-linear networks trained with
stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics (SGLD). At infinite width, this theory
reduces to kernel ridge regression, but at finite width it predicts a symmetry
breaking phase transition where networks abruptly align with target functions.
While the basic MF theory provides theoretical insight into the emergence of FL
in the finite-width regime, semi-quantitatively predicting the onset of FL with
noise or sample size, it substantially underestimates the improvements in
generalisation after the transition. We trace this discrepancy to a key
mechanism absent from the plain MF description: \textit{self-reinforcing input
feature selection}. Incorporating this mechanism into the MF theory allows us
to quantitatively match the learning curves of SGLD-trained networks and
provides mechanistic insight into FL.

Motivation: 测地线问题在物理和工程中广泛存在，但科学机器学习社区对此关注较少。作者认为测地线问题具有简单的几何结构、变分结构和自然非线性，特别适合深度Ritz方法。

Method: 使用深度Ritz方法解决测地线问题，通过三个数值例子进行验证：路径规划、光学和固体力学。

Result: 实验结果表明深度Ritz方法在测地线问题上表现良好，验证了该方法的适用性。

Conclusion: 测地线问题是深度Ritz方法的有前景应用方向，也是未来科学机器学习研究的富有成果的方向。

Abstract: Geodesic problems involve computing trajectories between prescribed initial
and final states to minimize a user-defined measure of distance, cost, or
energy. They arise throughout physics and engineering -- for instance, in
determining optimal paths through complex environments, modeling light
propagation in refractive media, and the study of spacetime trajectories in
control theory and general relativity. Despite their ubiquity, the scientific
machine learning (SciML) community has given relatively little attention to
investigating its methods in the context of these problems. In this work, we
argue that given their simple geometry, variational structure, and natural
nonlinearity, geodesic problems are particularly well-suited for the Deep Ritz
method. We substantiate this claim with three numerical examples drawn from
path planning, optics, and solid mechanics. Our goal is not to provide an
exhaustive study of geodesic problems, but rather to identify a promising
application of the Deep Ritz method and a fruitful direction for future SciML
research.

TL;DR: 提出一个两阶段模型，结合临床和影像信息来改进髋部骨折风险预测，相比传统工具具有更高敏感性和更少的漏诊。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工具如DXA T-score和FRAX在髋部骨折风险预测中敏感性不足，特别是对于无既往骨折史或骨量减少的高风险人群。

Method: 采用顺序两阶段模型：第一阶段使用临床、人口统计学和功能变量进行筛查，第二阶段结合DXA影像特征进行精炼预测。

Result: 模型在多个队列中验证显示一致性能，相比T-score和FRAX具有更高敏感性和更少的漏诊病例。

Conclusion: 该两阶段框架为早期髋部骨折风险评估提供了一种成本效益高且个性化的方法。

Abstract: Hip fractures are a major cause of disability, mortality, and healthcare
burden in older adults, underscoring the need for early risk assessment.
However, commonly used tools such as the DXA T-score and FRAX often lack
sensitivity and miss individuals at high risk, particularly those without prior
fractures or with osteopenia. To address this limitation, we propose a
sequential two-stage model that integrates clinical and imaging information to
improve prediction accuracy. Using data from the Osteoporotic Fractures in Men
Study (MrOS), the Study of Osteoporotic Fractures (SOF), and the UK Biobank,
Stage 1 (Screening) employs clinical, demographic, and functional variables to
estimate baseline risk, while Stage 2 (Imaging) incorporates DXA-derived
features for refinement. The model was rigorously validated through internal
and external testing, showing consistent performance and adaptability across
cohorts. Compared to T-score and FRAX, the two-stage framework achieved higher
sensitivity and reduced missed cases, offering a cost-effective and
personalized approach for early hip fracture risk assessment.

TL;DR: 该论文通过实证研究发现Mahalanobis距离方法在OOD检测中并非普遍可靠，定义了理想的数据表示几何结构，并提出了径向缩放ℓ2归一化方法来显著提升OOD检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然Mahalanobis距离方法被广泛用于OOD检测，但表示几何和归一化对其性能的影响尚未被充分理解，这限制了其下游应用。

Method: 进行了跨多样化图像基础模型、数据集和距离归一化方案的全面实证研究，定义了理想表示几何，并提出了径向缩放ℓ2归一化方法。

Result: 研究表明Mahalanobis方法并非普遍可靠；谱和内在维度指标能准确预测模型OOD性能；提出的径向缩放归一化方法能显著提升OOD检测性能。

Conclusion: 通过连接表示几何、归一化和OOD性能之间的差距，为设计更有效可靠的深度学习模型提供了新见解。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is critical for the reliable deployment
of deep learning models. hile Mahalanobis distance methods are widely used, the
impact of representation geometry and normalization on their performance is not
fully understood, which may limit their downstream application. To address this
gap, we conducted a comprehensive empirical study across diverse image
foundation models, datasets, and distance normalization schemes. First, our
analysis shows that Mahalanobis-based methods aren't universally reliable.
Second, we define the ideal geometry for data representations and demonstrate
that spectral and intrinsic-dimensionality metrics can accurately predict a
model's OOD performance. Finally, we analyze how normalization impacts OOD
performance. Building upon these studies, we propose radially scaled $\ell_2$
normalization, a method that generalizes the standard $\ell_2$ normalization
recently applied to Mahalanobis-based OOD detection. Our approach introduces a
tunable parameter to directly control the radial geometry of the feature space,
systematically contracting or expanding representations to significantly
improve OOD detection performance. By bridging the gap between representation
geometry, normalization, and OOD performance, our findings offer new insights
into the design of more effective and reliable deep learning models.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出ReasonIF基准评估大推理模型在推理过程中遵循用户指令的能力，发现现有模型指令遵循率低于25%，并探索了多轮推理和指令微调两种改进方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要评估模型主要响应的指令遵循能力，但推理过程中的指令遵循对模型可控性、透明度和安全性同样重要，需要专门评估。

Method: 构建ReasonIF基准，包含多语言推理、格式控制和长度控制等6类指令提示；测试多个开源大推理模型；探索多轮推理和推理指令微调(RIF)两种改进策略。

Result: 现有模型推理指令遵循得分(IFS)最高低于0.25；任务难度增加时指令遵循进一步下降；RIF方法将GPT-OSS-20B的IFS从0.11提升到0.27。

Conclusion: 大推理模型在推理过程中的指令遵循能力严重不足，RIF方法能带来改进但仍需大幅提升，推理指令遵循是重要的研究方向。

Abstract: The ability of large language models (LLMs) to follow user instructions is
central to their reliability, safety, and usefulness. While prior studies
assess instruction adherence in the model's main responses, we argue that it is
also critical for large reasoning models (LRMs) to follow user instructions
throughout their reasoning process. Reasoning instruction following makes LRMs
more controllable and transparent, while reducing risks of undesirable
shortcuts, hallucinations, or reward hacking within reasoning traces. To
evaluate this dimension, we introduce ReasonIF, a systematic benchmark for
assessing reasoning instruction following. ReasonIF includes six categories of
instruction prompts, spanning multilingual reasoning, formatting and length
control. Across many open-source LRMs including GPT-OSS, Qwen3, and
DeepSeek-R1, we find substantial failures in reasoning instruction adherence:
the highest instruction following score (IFS) remains below 0.25, meaning that
fewer than $25\%$ of reasoning traces comply with the given instructions.
Notably, as task difficulty increases, reasoning instruction following degrades
further. We also explore two strategies to enhance reasoning instruction
fidelity. (1) multi-turn reasoning and (2) Reasoning Instruction Finetuning
(RIF) using synthetic data. RIF improves the IFS of $GPT-OSS-20B$ from 0.11 to
0.27, indicating measurable progress but leaving ample room for improvement.

TL;DR: 研究发现，不同基础模型在强化学习可验证奖励（RLVR）后的推理表现差异源于其内部对规则正确性的感知能力。高潜力模型能系统区分严格规则与噪声规则的概率分布，而弱模型则无法区分。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究为什么不同预训练模型在RLVR后的推理表现差异巨大，寻找决定这种差异的微观特性。

Method: 将推理形式化为Horn子句链，使用跨层稀疏自编码器从潜在空间提取特征，估计特征间转移概率，并用LLM对规则语义正确性分级。引入SAL指标衡量分布分离度。

Result: 发现高潜力模型具有内在的正确性感知能力，其内部概率分布在规则正确性级别间系统变化，而弱模型则无法区分。SAL指标能准确预测RLVR后推理性能（R²=0.87）。

Conclusion: 模型的推理潜力与其预训练时区分正确知识与错误知识的内在能力相关，这为选择和设计更强基础模型提供了基于内部机制的实际指标。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) can elicit strong
reasoning in large language models (LLMs), while their performance after RLVR
varies dramatically across different base models. This raises a fundamental
question: what microscopic property of pre-trained models leads to this
variation? To investigate, we formalize reasoning as chains of Horn clauses
("if-then" rules) built from features extracted from the LLM's latent space via
cross-layer sparse autoencoders (SAEs). We estimate the transition
probabilities between its features, and further categorize each rule by its
semantic soundness level (e.g., strict, plausible, noisy) with an LLM. Our key
discovery is that high-potential models are inherently soundness-aware: their
internal probability distributions systematically shift across rules' soundness
levels, becoming highly distinct for "strict" versus "noisy" rules. In
contrast, weaker models are soundness-agnostic, collapsing to one distribution
regardless of soundness levels. To quantify this, we introduce the
Soundness-Aware Level (SAL), a microscopic metric using the Jensen-Shannon
Divergence to measure the separation between these distributions. We show that
SAL's predictions of post-RLVR reasoning performance follow a precise empirical
law (R^2=0.87) across diverse model families (Qwen, Mistral, Llama, DeepSeek)
and scales (0.5B-14B). This reveals that a model's reasoning potential is tied
to its intrinsic, pre-trained ability to distinguish sound knowledge from
unsound ones. These findings underscore the critical role of model pre-training
in shaping reasoning and offer a practical metric grounded in the model's
internal mechanisms for selecting/designing stronger base models.

Result: 集成学习模型在两个测试集上分别获得0.9637和0.9472的AUC值，表现出优秀的诊断性能。

Conclusion: 虽然直接部署临床诊断工具仍具挑战，但该研究为基于集成学习的脑膜炎AI诊断方法奠定了基础。

Abstract: We utilized a cohort of 214 meningitis patients and 46,303 non-meningitis
patients from the MIMIC-III database. After extensive data preprocessing, which
included ICD-based cohort selection, one-hot encoding of coding, and a
two-stage feature selection process (for both the training set and the testing
sets), clinically relevant features such as gender and high-risk ICD codes
(including subarachnoid hemorrhage, secondary malignant neoplasm of the brain,
and generalized epilepsy) are selected. Overall, these clinically reasonable
and temporally adherent features provided excellent modeling performance. Three
models (Random Forest, LightGBM, and Deep Neural Networks (DNN) are trained as
base models for Ensemble Learning. Base model outputs are aggregated and
stacked into a meta model (Logistic Regression) that uses the base model
outputs as input values in training. Ultimately, soldier outputs (AUC of
Testing Set 1: 0.9637, AUC of Testing Set 2: 0.9472) are obtained through
ensemble learning.
  We created a challenging condition for diagnosing meningitis, simulating a
real-world ER (Emergency Room) scenario to enhance clinical use in real-world
applications. While directly deploying a diagnostic tool that clinicians can
use is challenging, this paper paves the way for a potential future AI-driven
diagnostic approach for meningitis using Ensemble Learning.

that combining product coefficients with an autoencoder representation and a
KNN classifier delivers consistent performance gains over both PCA-based
baselines and our earlier framework. We also investigate the effect of adding
product coefficients level by level, revealing a clear trend: richer sets of
coefficients systematically improve class separability and overall accuracy.
The results highlight the value of combining hierarchical product-coefficient

Motivation: 研究在分布漂移情况下的顺序决策问题，需要开发能够适应分布变化并保持鲁棒性的决策方法。

Method: 提出熵正则化信任衰减方法，在信念更新和镜像下降决策中注入应力感知指数倾斜，并建立了Fenchel对偶等价性。

Result: 证明了高概率敏感性边界，在KL漂移路径长度S_T下实现了~O(√T)的动态遗憾保证，特别是实现了O(1)的每切换遗憾。

Conclusion: 该框架统一了动态遗憾分析、分布鲁棒目标和KL正则化控制，为应力自适应更新提供了理论基础和实用方法。

Abstract: We study sequential decision-making under distribution drift. We propose
entropy-regularized trust-decay, which injects stress-aware exponential tilting
into both belief updates and mirror-descent decisions. On the simplex, a
Fenchel-dual equivalence shows that belief tilt and decision tilt coincide. We
formalize robustness via fragility (worst-case excess risk in a KL ball),
belief bandwidth (radius sustaining a target excess), and a decision-space
Fragility Index (drift tolerated at $O(\sqrt{T})$ regret). We prove
high-probability sensitivity bounds and establish dynamic-regret guarantees of
$\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ under KL-drift path length $S_T = \sum_{t\ge2}\sqrt{{\rm
KL}(D_t|D_{t-1})/2}$. In particular, trust-decay achieves $O(1)$ per-switch
regret, while stress-free updates incur $\Omega(1)$ tails. A parameter-free
hedge adapts the tilt to unknown drift, whereas persistent over-tilting yields
an $\Omega(\lambda^2 T)$ stationary penalty. We further obtain
calibrated-stress bounds and extensions to second-order updates, bandit
feedback, outliers, stress variation, distributed optimization, and plug-in
KL-drift estimation. The framework unifies dynamic-regret analysis,
distributionally robust objectives, and KL-regularized control within a single
stress-adaptive update.

Abstract: Recent LLMs have demonstrated promising ability in solving finance related

challenging due to its high risk and high stakes property. This paper
introduces FinTrust, a comprehensive benchmark specifically designed for
evaluating the trustworthiness of LLMs in finance applications. Our benchmark
focuses on a wide range of alignment issues based on practical context and
features fine-grained tasks for each dimension of trustworthiness evaluation.
We assess eleven LLMs on FinTrust and find that proprietary models like o4-mini
outperforms in most tasks such as safety while open-source models like
DeepSeek-V3 have advantage in specific areas like industry-level fairness. For
challenging task like fiduciary alignment and disclosure, all LLMs fall short,
showing a significant gap in legal awareness. We believe that FinTrust can be a
valuable benchmark for LLMs' trustworthiness evaluation in finance domain.

TL;DR: TESSERA是一种新的不确定性量化方法，通过结合专家混合模型和保形校准，为蛋白质-配体亲和力预测提供可靠、信息丰富且自适应的不确定性区间，在分布偏移下仍能保持接近名义覆盖率和最佳覆盖宽度权衡。


<details>

Motivation: 当前机器学习社区缺乏可靠、信息丰富且个体化的不确定性量化方法，这阻碍了AI/ML在风险敏感领域的有效应用。特别是在药物发现中，蛋白质-配体亲和力预测面临异质噪声、不平衡化学空间和分布偏移等挑战。

Result: 在独立同分布和基于支架的分布外分割下，TESSERA达到接近名义覆盖率，获得最佳覆盖宽度权衡，同时保持竞争性的自适应能力。大小分层覆盖确认区间大小合适，在数据稀缺或噪声时宽度增加，在预测可靠时保持紧凑。

Conclusion: 通过统一专家混合模型多样性和保形校准，TESSERA提供了可信赖、紧凑且自适应的不确定性，适用于药物发现管道中的选择性预测和下游决策制定。

Abstract: Reliable, informative, and individual uncertainty quantification (UQ) remains
missing in current ML community. This hinders the effective application of
AI/ML to risk-sensitive domains. Most methods either fail to provide coverage
on new data, inflate intervals so broadly that they are not actionable, or
assign uncertainties that do not track actual error, especially under a
distribution shift. In high-stakes drug discovery, protein-ligand affinity
(PLI) prediction is especially challenging as assay noise is heterogeneous,
chemical space is imbalanced and large, and practical evaluations routinely
involve distribution shift. In this work, we introduce a novel uncertainty
quantification method, Trustworthy Expert Split-conformal with Scaled
Estimation for Efficient Reliable Adaptive intervals (TESSERA), that provides
per-sample uncertainty with reliable coverage guarantee, informative and
adaptive prediction interval widths that track the absolute error. We evaluate
on protein-ligand binding affinity prediction under both independent and
identically distributed (i.i.d.) and scaffold-based out-of-distribution (OOD)
splits, comparing against strong UQ baselines. TESSERA attains near-nominal
coverage and the best coverage-width trade-off as measured by the
Coverage-Width Criterion (CWC), while maintaining competitive adaptivity
(lowest Area Under the Sparsification Error (AUSE)). Size-Stratified Coverage
(SSC) further confirms that intervals are right-sized, indicating width
increases when data are scarce or noisy, and remain tight when predictions are
reliable. By unifying Mixture of Expert (MoE) diversity with conformal
calibration, TESSERA delivers trustworthy, tight, and adaptive uncertainties
that are well-suited to selective prediction and downstream decision-making in
the drug-discovery pipeline and other applications.

TL;DR: 提出Dual-Weighted Reinforcement Learning (DWRL)框架，将链式思维推理与Bradley-Terry模型结合，用于非可验证任务的人类偏好建模。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 强化学习在可验证任务上已证明有效，但扩展到非可验证的人类偏好任务仍然具有挑战性且研究不足。

Method: DWRL通过双权重RL目标整合CoT推理与BT模型，包含实例级错位权重和组级条件偏好分数，训练生成偏好模型先产生思维再预测偏好分数。

Result: 在多个基准测试和模型规模上，DWRL始终优于GPM基线和标量模型，同时产生连贯可解释的思维过程。

Conclusion: DWRL作为推理增强偏好学习的通用框架，可扩展到可验证任务之外。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has recently proven effective at scaling
chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning in large language models on tasks with
verifiable answers. However, extending RL to more general non-verifiable tasks,
typically in the format of human preference pairs, remains both challenging and
underexplored. In this work, we propose Dual-Weighted Reinforcement Learning
(DWRL), a new framework for preference modeling that integrates CoT reasoning
with the Bradley-Terry (BT) model via a dual-weighted RL objective that
preserves preference-modeling inductive bias. DWRL approximates the
maximum-likelihood objective of the BT model with two complementary weights: an
instance-wise misalignment weight, which emphasizes under-trained pairs
misaligned with human preference, and a group-wise (self-normalized)
conditional preference score, which promotes promising thoughts. In this paper,
we apply DWRL to preference modeling by training generative preference models
(GPMs) to first generate a thought and then predict the human preference score.
Across multiple benchmarks and model scales (Llama3 and Qwen2.5), DWRL
consistently outperforms both GPM baselines and scalar models, while producing
coherent, interpretable thoughts. In summary, our results position DWRL as a
general framework for reasoning-enhanced preference learning beyond verifiable
tasks.

Motivation: 准确预测禽类疾病爆发对野生动物保护和公共卫生至关重要，需要开发能够利用候鸟迁徙模式进行早期预警的系统。

Method: 整合多源数据集（Movebank GPS追踪、WOAH疫情记录、GADM和Natural Earth地理数据），使用H3分层地理空间编码处理坐标，基于Transformer架构学习时空依赖关系预测终点疾病风险。

Result: 在测试集上表现优异：准确率0.9821、AUC 0.9803、平均精度0.9299、F1分数0.8836，证明模型具有强预测能力。

Conclusion: Transformer架构在禽类疾病监测早期预警系统中具有巨大潜力，能够支持及时干预和预防策略的实施。

Abstract: Accurate forecasting of avian disease outbreaks is critical for wildlife
conservation and public health. This study presents a Transformer-based
framework for predicting the disease risk at the terminal locations of
migratory bird trajectories. We integrate multi-source datasets, including GPS
tracking data from Movebank, outbreak records from the World Organisation for
Animal Health (WOAH), and geospatial context from GADM and Natural Earth. The
raw coordinates are processed using H3 hierarchical geospatial encoding to
capture spatial patterns. The model learns spatiotemporal dependencies from
bird movement sequences to estimate endpoint disease risk. Evaluation on a
held-out test set demonstrates strong predictive performance, achieving an
accuracy of 0.9821, area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.9803, average precision
(AP) of 0.9299, and an F1-score of 0.8836 at the optimal threshold. These
results highlight the potential of Transformer architectures to support
early-warning systems for avian disease surveillance, enabling timely
intervention and prevention strategies.

*Yangyang Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DRO-InstructZero通过分布鲁棒优化方法改进零样本提示优化，在分布偏移和对抗性评估下显著提升提示的可靠性和可迁移性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自动提示搜索方法（如InstructZero）在单一评估分布下优化预期性能，导致提示在分布偏移和对抗性评估下性能下降，缺乏可靠性。

Method: 将零样本提示优化建模为鲁棒贝叶斯优化，使用f-散度球定义评估分布周围的模糊集，通过鲁棒采集规则最大化最坏情况期望效用，同时保持贝叶斯搜索的查询效率。

Result: 在形式化改写、代码调试和翻译任务中，准确率显著提升：BIG-Bench信息到形式化改写从61.3%提升至85-90%，代码调试在域偏移下提升约25个百分点，稳定任务保持96%以上性能。

Conclusion: DRO-InstructZero将分布鲁棒优化与提示学习相结合，为现实世界不确定性下的可靠、可迁移提示对齐提供了即插即用的通用方法。

Abstract: Large language models are highly sensitive to prompt wording. However,
popular automatic prompt search methods, including InstructZero, often degrade
under distribution shift and adversarial evaluation because they optimize
expected performance under a single evaluation distribution. Consequently,
prompts that work in one setting frequently fail to transfer. To address this,
DRO-InstructZero formulates zero-shot prompt optimization as robust Bayesian
optimization. Specifically, an f-divergence ball defines an ambiguity set
around the evaluation distribution, and a robust acquisition rule maximizes
worst-case expected utility while retaining the query efficiency of Bayesian
search. Therefore, the search explicitly targets reliability under distribution
shift rather than average behavior alone. Experiments follow the
instruction-induction protocol with matched query budgets across formality
rewriting, code debugging, and translation. For example, on BIG-Bench
informative-to-formal rewriting, accuracy improves from 61.3 +/- 0.7% to
approximately 85-90%, yielding an absolute gain of about 25-30 points.
Moreover, auto-debugging shows about +25-point gains under domain shift.
Meanwhile, stable tasks such as cause-and-effect remain above 96%, indicating
no loss on in-distribution cases. Furthermore, improvements are consistent
across divergence choices and decoding temperatures. Overall, DRO-InstructZero
connects distributionally robust optimization with prompt learning, offering a
plug-and-play and general approach for reliable, transferable prompt alignment
under real-world uncertainty.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种针对AdamW优化器的权重衰减缩放规则，解决了在尺度不变架构中μP方法因归一化层导致的向后尺度敏感性问题，实现了跨宽度学习率和权重衰减的零样本迁移。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代尺度不变架构训练时快速进入优化器主导的稳态，归一化层造成向后尺度敏感性，导致有效学习率变得宽度依赖，从而降低了μP方法的迁移效果。

Method: 引入AdamW的权重衰减缩放规则，保持子层增益跨宽度不变。通过观察奇异值谱的缩放行为，提出经验性权重衰减缩放规则λ₂∝√d，与μP学习率规则η₂∝d⁻¹结合实现子层增益宽度不变。

Result: 在LLaMA风格Transformer和最小合成设置中验证了该规则的有效性，提供了匹配顶部奇异值的简单诊断方法来检查子层增益不变性。

Conclusion: 通过显式控制优化器设置的稳态尺度，将μP方法扩展到近初始化阶段之外，为AdamW下的宽度鲁棒超参数迁移提供了实用方案。

Abstract: Empirical scaling laws prescribe how to allocate parameters, data, and
compute, while maximal-update parameterization ($\mu$P) enables learning-rate
transfer across widths by equalizing early-time update magnitudes. However, in
modern scale-invariant architectures, training quickly enters an
optimizer-governed steady state where normalization layers create backward
scale sensitivity and the effective learning rate becomes width dependent,
degrading $\mu$P transfer. We address this by introducing a weight-decay
scaling rule for AdamW that preserves sublayer gain across widths. Empirically,
the singular-value spectrum of each matrix parameter scales in norm as
$\sqrt{\eta/\lambda}$ with an approximately invariant shape; under width
scaling $d$, we observe that the top singular value scales approximately as
$\sqrt{\eta/\lambda}\cdot d^{0.75}$. Combining this observation with the $\mu$P
learning-rate rule $\eta_2\propto d^{-1}$ for matrix-like parameters implies an
empirical weight-decay scaling rule $\lambda_2\propto \sqrt{d}$ that
approximately keeps sublayer gains width invariant. Together with vector-like
parameters trained at $\eta_1=\Theta_d(1)$ and $\lambda_1=0$, this yields
\emph{zero-shot} transfer of both learning rate and weight decay from proxy to
target widths, removing per-width sweeps. We validate the rule on LLaMA-style
Transformers and in a minimal synthetic setting, and we provide a simple
diagnostic, matching top singular values, to check sublayer-gain invariance.
Our results extend $\mu$P beyond the near-init regime by explicitly controlling
steady-state scales set by the optimizer, offering a practical recipe for
width-robust hyperparameter transfer under AdamW.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前地球观测中的时空模型主要依赖相关性特征，在异构域间迁移能力差。因果建模能发现稳定不变的关系，提高分布偏移下的鲁棒性和泛化能力

Method: 提出RIC-TSC框架，使用J-PCMCI+方法进行区域感知的因果发现，识别特定区域和不变的预测因子及其时间滞后，将验证的预测因子输入轻量级分类器

Result: 在两个对比融化季节的1000个手动标注湖泊数据集上，因果模型在分布外评估中比相关性基线准确率最高提升12.59%

Conclusion: 因果发现不仅是特征选择手段，更是构建可泛化、机制基础的地球表面动态过程模型的途径

Abstract: Causal modeling offers a principled foundation for uncovering stable,
invariant relationships in time-series data, thereby improving robustness and
generalization under distribution shifts. Yet its potential is underutilized in
spatiotemporal Earth observation, where models often depend on purely
correlational features that fail to transfer across heterogeneous domains. We
propose RIC-TSC, a regionally-informed causal time-series classification
framework that embeds lag-aware causal discovery directly into sequence
modeling, enabling both predictive accuracy and scientific interpretability.
Using multi-modal satellite and reanalysis data-including Sentinel-1 microwave
backscatter, Sentinel-2 and Landsat-8 optical reflectance, and CARRA
meteorological variables-we leverage Joint PCMCI+ (J-PCMCI+) to identify
region-specific and invariant predictors of supraglacial lake evolution in
Greenland. Causal graphs are estimated globally and per basin, with validated
predictors and their time lags supplied to lightweight classifiers. On a
balanced benchmark of 1000 manually labeled lakes from two contrasting melt
seasons (2018-2019), causal models achieve up to 12.59% higher accuracy than
correlation-based baselines under out-of-distribution evaluation. These results
show that causal discovery is not only a means of feature selection but also a
pathway to generalizable and mechanistically grounded models of dynamic Earth
surface processes.

Conclusion: 所提出的不确定性感知伪标签框架有效解决了半监督回归中的伪标签可靠性问题，为连续输出场景下的半监督学习提供了新思路。

Abstract: Pseudo-labeling is a commonly used paradigm in semi-supervised learning, yet
its application to semi-supervised regression (SSR) remains relatively
under-explored. Unlike classification, where pseudo-labels are discrete and
confidence-based filtering is effective, SSR involves continuous outputs with
heteroscedastic noise, making it challenging to assess pseudo-label
reliability. As a result, naive pseudo-labeling can lead to error accumulation
and overfitting to incorrect labels. To address this, we propose an
uncertainty-aware pseudo-labeling framework that dynamically adjusts
pseudo-label influence from a bi-level optimization perspective. By jointly
minimizing empirical risk over all data and optimizing uncertainty estimates to
enhance generalization on labeled data, our method effectively mitigates the
impact of unreliable pseudo-labels. We provide theoretical insights and
extensive experiments to validate our approach across various benchmark SSR
datasets, and the results demonstrate superior robustness and performance
compared to existing methods. Our code is available at

Abstract: Foundation models (FMs), such as GPT-4 and AlphaFold, are reshaping the
landscape of scientific research. Beyond accelerating tasks such as hypothesis
generation, experimental design, and result interpretation, they prompt a more
fundamental question: Are FMs merely enhancing existing scientific
methodologies, or are they redefining the way science is conducted? In this
paper, we argue that FMs are catalyzing a transition toward a new scientific
paradigm. We introduce a three-stage framework to describe this evolution: (1)
Meta-Scientific Integration, where FMs enhance workflows within traditional
paradigms; (2) Hybrid Human-AI Co-Creation, where FMs become active
collaborators in problem formulation, reasoning, and discovery; and (3)
Autonomous Scientific Discovery, where FMs operate as independent agents
capable of generating new scientific knowledge with minimal human intervention.
Through this lens, we review current applications and emerging capabilities of
FMs across existing scientific paradigms. We further identify risks and future
directions for FM-enabled scientific discovery. This position paper aims to
support the scientific community in understanding the transformative role of
FMs and to foster reflection on the future of scientific discovery. Our project

Method: 先用小集成规模的EnKF生成初步分析状态，然后用全连接神经网络学习并预测校正项来补偿集成规模限制带来的性能下降

Result: 在Lorenz系统和非线性海洋波场模拟实验中，新方法比传统EnKF在相同集成规模下精度更高，且额外计算成本可忽略

Conclusion: EnKF-FCNN方法通过机器学习校正提高了数据同化精度，适应性强，可与不同模型和集成数据同化方法结合

Abstract: Ensemble-based data assimilation (DA) methods have become increasingly
popular due to their inherent ability to address nonlinear dynamic problems.
However, these methods often face a trade-off between analysis accuracy and
computational efficiency, as larger ensemble sizes required for higher accuracy
also lead to greater computational cost. In this study, we propose a novel
machine learning-based data assimilation approach that combines the traditional
ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) with a fully connected neural network (FCNN).
Specifically, our method uses a relatively small ensemble size to generate
preliminary yet suboptimal analysis states via EnKF. A FCNN is then employed to
learn and predict correction terms for these states, thereby mitigating the
performance degradation induced by the limited ensemble size. We evaluate the
performance of our proposed EnKF-FCNN method through numerical experiments
involving Lorenz systems and nonlinear ocean wave field simulations. The
results consistently demonstrate that the new method achieves higher accuracy
than traditional EnKF with the same ensemble size, while incurring negligible
additional computational cost. Moreover, the EnKF-FCNN method is adaptable to
diverse applications through coupling with different models and the use of
alternative ensemble-based DA methods.

Conclusion: DFCA展示了在动态现实世界去中心化网络中的鲁棒性和实用性，为处理异构数据的聚类联邦学习提供了有效的去中心化解决方案。

Abstract: Clustered Federated Learning has emerged as an effective approach for
handling heterogeneous data across clients by partitioning them into clusters
with similar or identical data distributions. However, most existing methods,
including the Iterative Federated Clustering Algorithm (IFCA), rely on a
central server to coordinate model updates, which creates a bottleneck and a
single point of failure, limiting their applicability in more realistic
decentralized learning settings. In this work, we introduce DFCA, a fully
decentralized clustered FL algorithm that enables clients to collaboratively
train cluster-specific models without central coordination. DFCA uses a
sequential running average to aggregate models from neighbors as updates
arrive, providing a communication-efficient alternative to batch aggregation
while maintaining clustering performance. Our experiments on various datasets
demonstrate that DFCA outperforms other decentralized algorithms and performs
comparably to centralized IFCA, even under sparse connectivity, highlighting
its robustness and practicality for dynamic real-world decentralized networks.

Conclusion: 数据依赖的杠杆加权采样能显著减少RFLAF模型所需特征数量，提高学习效率，理论和实验均验证了该方法的有效性。

Abstract: This paper studies the generalization properties of a recently proposed
kernel method, the Random Feature models with Learnable Activation Functions
(RFLAF). By applying a data-dependent sampling scheme for generating features,
we provide by far the sharpest bounds on the required number of features for
learning RFLAF in both the regression and classification tasks. We provide a
unified theorem that describes the complexity of the feature number $s$, and
discuss the results for the plain sampling scheme and the data-dependent
leverage weighted scheme. Through weighted sampling, the bound on $s$ in the
MSE loss case is improved from $\Omega(1/\epsilon^2)$ to
$\tilde{\Omega}((1/\epsilon)^{1/t})$ in general $(t\geq 1)$, and even to
$\Omega(1)$ when the Gram matrix has a finite rank. For the Lipschitz loss
case, the bound is improved from $\Omega(1/\epsilon^2)$ to
$\tilde{\Omega}((1/\epsilon^2)^{1/t})$. To learn the weighted RFLAF, we also
propose an algorithm to find an approximate kernel and then apply the leverage
weighted sampling. Empirical results show that the weighted RFLAF achieves the
same performances with a significantly fewer number of features compared to the
plainly sampled RFLAF, validating our theories and the effectiveness of this
method.

Conclusion: 基于MoE的统一防御框架能够有效同时防御多种图对抗攻击，通过逻辑多样性和自适应路由机制确保在局部结构扰动下仍有足够专家子集保持不受影响。

Abstract: Extensive research has highlighted the vulnerability of graph neural networks
(GNNs) to adversarial attacks, including manipulation, node injection, and the
recently emerging threat of backdoor attacks. However, existing defenses
typically focus on a single type of attack, lacking a unified approach to
simultaneously defend against multiple threats. In this work, we leverage the
flexibility of the Mixture of Experts (MoE) architecture to design a scalable
and unified framework for defending against backdoor, edge manipulation, and
node injection attacks. Specifically, we propose an MI-based logic diversity
loss to encourage individual experts to focus on distinct neighborhood
structures in their decision processes, thus ensuring a sufficient subset of
experts remains unaffected under perturbations in local structures. Moreover,
we introduce a robustness-aware router that identifies perturbation patterns
and adaptively routes perturbed nodes to corresponding robust experts.
Extensive experiments conducted under various adversarial settings demonstrate
that our method consistently achieves superior robustness against multiple
graph adversarial attacks.

Conclusion: 谱均值流方法通过算子理论和MMD梯度流的结合，为序列建模提供了新的可扩展框架。

Abstract: A key question in sequence modeling with neural networks is how to represent
and learn highly nonlinear and probabilistic state dynamics. Operator theory
views such dynamics as linear maps on Hilbert spaces containing mean embedding
vectors of distributions, offering an appealing but currently overlooked
perspective. We propose a new approach to sequence modeling based on an
operator-theoretic view of a hidden Markov model (HMM). Instead of
materializing stochastic recurrence, we embed the full sequence distribution as
a tensor in the product Hilbert space. A generative process is then defined as
maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) gradient flow in the space of sequences. To
overcome challenges with large tensors and slow sampling convergence, we
introduce spectral mean flows, a novel tractable algorithm integrating two core
concepts. First, we propose a new neural architecture by leveraging spectral
decomposition of linear operators to derive a scalable tensor network
decomposition of sequence mean embeddings. Second, we extend MMD gradient flows
to time-dependent Hilbert spaces and connect them to flow matching via the
continuity equation, enabling simulation-free learning and faster sampling. We
demonstrate competitive results on a range of time-series modeling datasets.

Abstract: The recent development of zero-shot reinforcement learning (RL) has opened a
new avenue for learning pre-trained generalist policies that can adapt to
arbitrary new tasks in a zero-shot manner. While the popular Forward-Backward
representations (FB) and related methods have shown promise in zero-shot RL, we
empirically found that their modeling lacks expressivity and that extrapolation
errors caused by out-of-distribution (OOD) actions during offline learning
sometimes lead to biased representations, ultimately resulting in suboptimal
performance. To address these issues, we propose Behavior-REgularizEd Zero-shot
RL with Expressivity enhancement (BREEZE), an upgraded FB-based framework that
simultaneously enhances learning stability, policy extraction capability, and
representation learning quality. BREEZE introduces behavioral regularization in
zero-shot RL policy learning, transforming policy optimization into a stable
in-sample learning paradigm. Additionally, BREEZE extracts the policy using a
task-conditioned diffusion model, enabling the generation of high-quality and
multimodal action distributions in zero-shot RL settings. Moreover, BREEZE
employs expressive attention-based architectures for representation modeling to
capture the complex relationships between environmental dynamics. Extensive
experiments on ExORL and D4RL Kitchen demonstrate that BREEZE achieves the best

Conclusion: SWFP提供了一个高效且稳定的框架，用于微调预训练流策略，具有简化训练、降低计算成本和可证明稳定性等优势。

Abstract: While behavior cloning with flow/diffusion policies excels at learning
complex skills from demonstrations, it remains vulnerable to distributional
shift, and standard RL methods struggle to fine-tune these models due to their
iterative inference process and the limitations of existing workarounds. In
this work, we introduce the Stepwise Flow Policy (SWFP) framework, founded on
the key insight that discretizing the flow matching inference process via a
fixed-step Euler scheme inherently aligns it with the variational
Jordan-Kinderlehrer-Otto (JKO) principle from optimal transport. SWFP
decomposes the global flow into a sequence of small, incremental
transformations between proximate distributions. Each step corresponds to a JKO
update, regularizing policy changes to stay near the previous iterate and
ensuring stable online adaptation with entropic regularization. This
decomposition yields an efficient algorithm that fine-tunes pre-trained flows
via a cascade of small flow blocks, offering significant advantages:
simpler/faster training of sub-models, reduced computational/memory costs, and
provable stability grounded in Wasserstein trust regions. Comprehensive
experiments demonstrate SWFP's enhanced stability, efficiency, and superior
adaptation performance across diverse robotic control benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前电解质研究面临两个基本挑战：缺乏高质量标准化基准，以及对混合物系统中几何结构和分子间相互作用建模不足。

Method: 首先重组并增强CALiSol和DiffMix电解质数据集，加入分子几何图表示；然后提出GeoMix框架，保持Set-SE(3)等变性，核心是专门为分子间几何消息传递设计的几何交互网络(GIN)。

Result: GeoMix在两个数据集上持续优于多种基线方法（包括MLPs、GNNs和几何GNNs），验证了跨分子几何相互作用和等变消息传递对准确性质预测的重要性。

Conclusion: 这项工作不仅为电解质研究建立了新基准，还提供了一个通用的几何学习框架，可推进能源材料、药物开发等领域中混合物系统的建模。

Abstract: Accurate prediction of ionic conductivity in electrolyte systems is crucial
for advancing numerous scientific and technological applications. While
significant progress has been made, current research faces two fundamental
challenges: (1) the lack of high-quality standardized benchmarks, and (2)
inadequate modeling of geometric structure and intermolecular interactions in
mixture systems. To address these limitations, we first reorganize and enhance
the CALiSol and DiffMix electrolyte datasets by incorporating geometric graph
representations of molecules. We then propose GeoMix, a novel geometry-aware
framework that preserves Set-SE(3) equivariance-an essential but challenging
property for mixture systems. At the heart of GeoMix lies the Geometric
Interaction Network (GIN), an equivariant module specifically designed for
intermolecular geometric message passing. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate
that GeoMix consistently outperforms diverse baselines (including MLPs, GNNs,
and geometric GNNs) across both datasets, validating the importance of
cross-molecular geometric interactions and equivariant message passing for
accurate property prediction. This work not only establishes new benchmarks for
electrolyte research but also provides a general geometric learning framework
that advances modeling of mixture systems in energy materials, pharmaceutical
development, and beyond.

Motivation: 实时流数据预测面临非平稳动态、严格计算限制和快速适应而不发生灾难性遗忘等关键挑战。现有方法在准确性、适应性和效率之间存在权衡，特别是在受限计算环境中部署时。

Method: WORK-DMD将随机傅里叶特征与在线动态模态分解相结合，使用滚动窗口内的Sherman-Morrison更新，仅从当前数据连续适应演化动态，无需长时间训练或大量历史数据存储。

Result: 在多个领域的基准数据集上的实验表明，WORK-DMD比几种最先进的在线预测方法获得更高的准确性，同时只需要单次数据遍历，在短期预测中表现尤为出色。

Conclusion: 结合核评估与自适应矩阵更新，在最小数据需求下实现了强大的预测性能。这种样本效率为流预测应用提供了深度学习的实用替代方案。

Abstract: Real-time forecasting from streaming data poses critical challenges: handling
non-stationary dynamics, operating under strict computational limits, and
adapting rapidly without catastrophic forgetting. However, many existing
approaches face trade-offs between accuracy, adaptability, and efficiency,
particularly when deployed in constrained computing environments. We introduce
WORK-DMD (Windowed Online Random Kernel Dynamic Mode Decomposition), a method
that combines Random Fourier Features with online Dynamic Mode Decomposition to
capture nonlinear dynamics through explicit feature mapping, while preserving
fixed computational cost and competitive predictive accuracy across evolving
data. WORK-DMD employs Sherman-Morrison updates within rolling windows,
enabling continuous adaptation to evolving dynamics from only current data,
eliminating the need for lengthy training or large storage requirements for
historical data. Experiments on benchmark datasets across several domains show
that WORK-DMD achieves higher accuracy than several state-of-the-art online
forecasting methods, while requiring only a single pass through the data and
demonstrating particularly strong performance in short-term forecasting. Our
results show that combining kernel evaluations with adaptive matrix updates
achieves strong predictive performance with minimal data requirements. This
sample efficiency offers a practical alternative to deep learning for streaming
forecasting applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决深度Transformer模型带来的训练时间长、推理延迟高以及在资源受限设备上不实用的问题，挑战'越深越好'的传统观念。

Method: 将标准Transformer建模为闭式函数逼近器，通过理论分析发现性能依赖于层间协作而非深度本身。通过并行分支结构组织层，算法化地强制层间协作，实现渐进逼近。

Result: ParaFormer在实验中优于标准Transformer如ViT，支持高达15.07倍的模型压缩，在多GPU部署中比FairScale等并行解决方案快3.30倍。

Conclusion: 基于通用逼近定理的闭式Transformer公式不仅解释了'深度信念'，还为设计高效Transformer架构开辟了新途径。

Abstract: The widespread 'deeper is better' philosophy has driven the creation of
architectures like ResNet and Transformer, which achieve high performance by
stacking numerous layers. However, increasing model depth comes with challenges
such as longer training times, higher inference latency, and impracticality on
resource-constrained devices. To address these issues, we propose ParaFormer, a
shallow Transformer architecture designed for true parallelism in both
structure and computation. By formulating standard Transformers as function
approximators in closed-form, our theoretical analysis shows that their
performance relies on inter-layer collaboration for progressive approximation,
rather than depth itself. While deep Transformers enforce this collaboration
through sequential designs, we demonstrate that such collaboration is not
inherently tied to sequential structures. ParaFormer removes the sequential
constraint by organizing layers into parallel branches, enforcing inter-layer
collaboration algorithmically. Specifically, we implement progressive
approximation, ensuring that each new branch further reduces the loss from
preceding branches, enabling faster convergence. Extensive experiments validate
ParaFormer's effectiveness, outperforming standard Transformers like ViT.
Moreover, ParaFormer supports up to 15.07x model compression and facilitates
model expansion for adaptive continuous learning. Experimental results on
multi-GPU deployment demonstrate that ParaFormer is 3.30x faster than widely
used parallelism solutions such as FairScale. These advancements stem from our
closed-form formulation of Transformers based on the Universal Approximation
Theorem, which not only explains the ``depth belief'' but also opens new
avenues for designing efficient Transformer architectures. Source code:

Abstract: This dissertation investigates how reinforcement learning (RL) methods can be
designed to be safe, sample-efficient, and robust. Framed through the unifying
perspective of contextual-bandit RL, the work addresses two major application
domains - ranking and recommendation, and text-to-image diffusion models. The
first part of the thesis develops theory and algorithms for safe deployment in
ranking systems. An exposure-based generalisation bound is derived, leading to
a counterfactual risk-minimisation objective whose solution is guaranteed not
to underperform the logging policy, even with sparse feedback. This guarantee
is extended to doubly robust estimators, enabling safety even under adversarial
or misspecified user models and offering practitioners explicit control over
permissible utility loss. The second part turns to single-action bandits, where
various off-policy estimators are unified within a baseline-correction
framework. A closed-form optimal baseline is proposed and shown to minimise
both evaluation and policy-gradient variance, thereby improving off-policy
learning reliability. The final part examines the trade-offs between efficiency
and effectiveness in generative RL. A systematic study of PPO and REINFORCE
motivates the Leave-One-Out PPO (LOOP) algorithm, which combines multiple
diffusion trajectories with a REINFORCE-style baseline inside PPO's clipped
objective. LOOP achieves PPO-level sample efficiency while producing
generations that align more faithfully with textual attributes.

Conclusion: RPC方法通过理论指导的混合策略，有效解决了现有测试时缩放方法的局限性，在减少推理错误方面具有强大潜力。

Abstract: Test-time scaling seeks to improve the reasoning performance of large
language models (LLMs) by adding computational resources. A prevalent approach
within the field is sampling-based test-time scaling methods, which enhance
reasoning by generating multiple reasoning paths for a given input during
inference. However, despite its practical success, the theoretical foundations
remain underexplored. In this paper, we provide the first theoretical framework
for analyzing sampling-based test-time scaling methods, grounded in the
perspective of confidence estimation. Based on the framework, we analyze two
dominant paradigms: self-consistency and perplexity, and reveal key
limitations: self-consistency suffers from high estimation error while
perplexity exhibits substantial modeling error and possible degradation of the
estimation error convergence. To address these limitations, we introduce RPC, a
hybrid method that leverages our theoretical insights through two key
components: Perplexity Consistency and Reasoning Pruning. Perplexity
Consistency combines the strengths of self-consistency and perplexity, boosting
the convergence rate of estimation error from linear to exponential while
preserving model error. Reasoning Pruning prevents degradation by eliminating
low-probability reasoning paths. Both theoretical analysis and empirical
results across seven benchmark datasets demonstrate that RPC has a strong
potential for reducing reasoning error. Notably, RPC achieves reasoning
performance comparable to self-consistency while not only enhancing confidence
reliability but also reducing sampling costs by 50%. The code and resources are
available at https://wnjxyk.github.io/RPC.

Motivation: 隐变量能量模型能够为观测数据和隐变量的联合对分配归一化能量，在表达性生成建模的同时捕捉隐藏结构，但传统训练方法存在局限性

Method: 将最大似然训练重新表述为隐变量和联合流形上分布的鞍点问题，使用耦合Wasserstein梯度流进行内层更新，交替进行过阻尼Langevin更新和随机参数上升

Result: 在标准平滑性和耗散性假设下证明了存在性和收敛性，在KL散度和Wasserstein-2距离上具有衰减率，在物理系统数值近似上表现具有竞争力

Conclusion: 鞍点视角产生了比受限摊销后验获得的边界更严格的ELBO，该方法为隐变量能量模型训练提供了有效的替代方案

Abstract: Latent-variable energy-based models (LVEBMs) assign a single normalized
energy to joint pairs of observed data and latent variables, offering
expressive generative modeling while capturing hidden structure. We recast
maximum-likelihood training as a saddle problem over distributions on the
latent and joint manifolds and view the inner updates as coupled Wasserstein
gradient flows. The resulting algorithm alternates overdamped Langevin updates
for a joint negative pool and for conditional latent particles with stochastic
parameter ascent, requiring no discriminator or auxiliary networks. We prove
existence and convergence under standard smoothness and dissipativity
assumptions, with decay rates in KL divergence and Wasserstein-2 distance. The
saddle-point view further yields an ELBO strictly tighter than bounds obtained
with restricted amortized posteriors. Our method is evaluated on numerical
approximations of physical systems and performs competitively against
comparable approaches.

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms struggle with learning optimal
policies for tasks where reward feedback is sparse and depends on a complex
sequence of events in the environment. Probabilistic reward machines (PRMs) are
finite-state formalisms that can capture temporal dependencies in the reward
signal, along with nondeterministic task outcomes. While special RL algorithms
can exploit this finite-state structure to expedite learning, PRMs remain
difficult to modify and design by hand. This hinders the already difficult
tasks of utilizing high-level causal knowledge about the environment, and
transferring the reward formalism into a new domain with a different causal
structure. This paper proposes a novel method to incorporate causal information
in the form of Temporal Logic-based Causal Diagrams into the reward formalism,
thereby expediting policy learning and aiding the transfer of task
specifications to new environments. Furthermore, we provide a theoretical
result about convergence to optimal policy for our method, and demonstrate its
strengths empirically.

Motivation: 传统方法假设演示者属于低复杂度策略类，但本文认为奖励模型（指定哪些答案正确）属于低基数类是更弱的假设，在这种情况下最大似然估计可能失败。

Method: 将问题形式化为上下文老虎机中的离线模仿学习，基于奖励模型低基数假设，设计了一种样本复杂度与奖励类基数对数相关的新方法。

Result: 证明了最大似然方法在这种情况下可能失败，而新方法能有效学习，样本复杂度与奖励类基数呈对数关系。

Conclusion: 当从正确演示中学习时，需要超越传统的似然最大化方法，考虑基于奖励模型低基数假设的替代方法。

Abstract: We study the problem of learning to generate an answer (or completion) to a
question (or prompt), where there could be multiple correct answers, any one of
which is acceptable at test time. Learning is based on demonstrations of some
correct answer to each training question, as in Supervised Fine Tuning (SFT).
We formalize the problem as offline imitation learning in contextual bandits,
with demonstrations from some optimal policy, without explicitly observed
rewards. Prior work assumes that the demonstrator belongs to a low-complexity
policy class, which motivates maximum likelihood estimation (i.e., log-loss
minimization). In contrast, we propose relying only on the reward model
(specifying which answers are correct) being in a low-cardinality class, which
we argue is a weaker assumption. We show that likelihood maximization methods
can fail in this case, and instead devise an alternative novel approach that
learns with sample complexity logarithmic in the cardinality of the reward
class. Our work motivates looking beyond likelihood maximization when learning
from correct demonstrations.

Abstract: We study counterfactual prediction under assignment bias and propose a
mathematically grounded, information-theoretic approach that removes
treatment-covariate dependence without adversarial training. Starting from a
bound that links the counterfactual-factual risk gap to mutual information, we
learn a stochastic representation Z that is predictive of outcomes while
minimizing I(Z; T). We derive a tractable variational objective that
upper-bounds the information term and couples it with a supervised decoder,
yielding a stable, provably motivated training criterion. The framework extends
naturally to dynamic settings by applying the information penalty to sequential
representations at each decision time. We evaluate the method on controlled
numerical simulations and a real-world clinical dataset, comparing against
recent state-of-the-art balancing, reweighting, and adversarial baselines.
Across metrics of likelihood, counterfactual error, and policy evaluation, our
approach performs favorably while avoiding the training instabilities and
tuning burden of adversarial schemes.

Conclusion: OffSim能够直接从专家轨迹中学习环境和奖励，实现高效的离线策略训练，无需真实环境交互

Abstract: Reinforcement learning algorithms typically utilize an interactive simulator
(i.e., environment) with a predefined reward function for policy training.
Developing such simulators and manually defining reward functions, however, is
often time-consuming and labor-intensive. To address this, we propose an
Offline Simulator (OffSim), a novel model-based offline inverse reinforcement
learning (IRL) framework, to emulate environmental dynamics and reward
structure directly from expert-generated state-action trajectories. OffSim
jointly optimizes a high-entropy transition model and an IRL-based reward
function to enhance exploration and improve the generalizability of the learned
reward. Leveraging these learned components, OffSim can subsequently train a
policy offline without further interaction with the real environment.
Additionally, we introduce OffSim$^+$, an extension that incorporates a
marginal reward for multi-dataset settings to enhance exploration. Extensive
MuJoCo experiments demonstrate that OffSim achieves substantial performance
gains over existing offline IRL methods, confirming its efficacy and
robustness.

Motivation: 强化学习在提升大语言模型推理能力时存在探索有限和熵崩溃问题，模型容易陷入狭窄解决方案集，导致采样多样性丧失，阻碍性能进一步提升。

Method: SESA顺序采样框架：首先生成多样化的解决方案草图，然后将其扩展为完整推理路径，通过条件每个新输出于先前输出，促进过程多样性，防止策略崩溃。

Result: 在合成任务中，顺序采样在路径多样性和崩溃恢复方面优于传统RL方法；在三个智能体基准测试中，成功率分别提升+0.25、+0.42和+0.07（相对基线RL最高提升211%）。

Conclusion: SESA为探索提供了结构化方法，为RL训练的大语言模型实现更有效和多样化的推理铺平了道路。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has been pivotal in enhancing the reasoning
capabilities of large language models (LLMs), but it often suffers from limited
exploration and entropy collapse, where models exploit a narrow set of
solutions, leading to a loss of sampling diversity and subsequently preventing
RL from further improving performance. This issue is exacerbated in parallel
sampling methods, where multiple outputs are drawn from the same distribution,
potentially causing the model to converge to similar solutions. We propose
SESA, a novel SEquential SAmpling framework that mitigates this challenge by
generating diverse solution sketches sequentially before expanding them into
full reasoning paths. This approach ensures broader exploration by conditioning
each new output on previous ones, promoting diversity throughout the process
and preventing policy collapse. Our experiments on a synthetic task show that
sequential sampling consistently outperforms traditional RL methods in terms of
path diversity and recovery from collapse. Further evaluations on real-world
tasks demonstrate that SESA improves both the exploration of valid strategies
and the overall performance of LLMs. On three agent benchmarks, SESA lifts
success rates by $+0.25$, $+0.42$, and $+0.07$ absolute over the base model (up
to an additional $211\%$ relative improvement over baseline RL), underscoring
its exploration advantage. This work introduces a structured approach to
exploration, paving the way for more effective and diverse reasoning in
RL-trained LLMs. Our code is released at https://github.com/MuLabPKU/sesa.

Motivation: 挑战传统观点，即Transformer组件（如非线性激活和归一化）本质上是非单射的，可能阻止从模型表示中精确恢复输入。

Method: 首先数学证明Transformer语言模型在初始化和训练过程中保持单射性；其次通过数十亿次碰撞测试在六个最先进语言模型上验证；最后提出SipIt算法，可证明且高效地从隐藏激活重建精确输入文本。

Result: 数学证明和实证测试均表明Transformer语言模型是单射的，未观察到任何碰撞；SipIt算法在实践中实现了精确可逆性，具有线性时间保证。

Conclusion: 单射性是语言模型的基本且可利用属性，对透明度、可解释性和安全部署具有直接意义。

Abstract: Transformer components such as non-linear activations and normalization are
inherently non-injective, suggesting that different inputs could map to the
same output and prevent exact recovery of the input from a model's
representations. In this paper, we challenge this view. First, we prove
mathematically that transformer language models mapping discrete input
sequences to their corresponding sequence of continuous representations are
injective and therefore lossless, a property established at initialization and
preserved during training. Second, we confirm this result empirically through
billions of collision tests on six state-of-the-art language models, and
observe no collisions. Third, we operationalize injectivity: we introduce
SipIt, the first algorithm that provably and efficiently reconstructs the exact
input text from hidden activations, establishing linear-time guarantees and
demonstrating exact invertibility in practice. Overall, our work establishes
injectivity as a fundamental and exploitable property of language models, with
direct implications for transparency, interpretability, and safe deployment.

Method: 在多种数据集、任务和神经网络架构上进行广泛实验，测试不同数据集大小下蒸馏的效果，并验证现有理论（标签平滑假说和暗知识假说）的预测能力。

Result: 蒸馏效果在低数据量情况下不仅保持而且增强，这一现象被称为蒸馏的数据效率。结果否定了蒸馏可理解为标签平滑的假说，支持了暗知识假说。

Abstract: The concept of knowledge distillation (KD) describes the training of a
student model from a teacher model and is a widely adopted technique in deep
learning. However, it is still not clear how and why distillation works.
Previous studies focus on two central aspects of distillation: model size, and
generalisation. In this work we study distillation in a third dimension:
dataset size. We present a suite of experiments across a wide range of
datasets, tasks and neural architectures, demonstrating that the effect of
distillation is not only preserved but amplified in low-data regimes. We call
this newly discovered property the data efficiency of distillation. Equipped
with this new perspective, we test the predictive power of existing theories of
KD as we vary the dataset size. Our results disprove the hypothesis that
distillation can be understood as label smoothing, and provide further evidence
in support of the dark knowledge hypothesis. Finally, we analyse the impact of
modelling factors such as the objective, scale and relative number of samples
on the observed phenomenon. Ultimately, this work reveals that the dataset size
may be a fundamental but overlooked variable in the mechanisms underpinning
distillation.

Result: 在重建数据质量、渲染和可视化质量、变量间依赖关系保持以及存储效率方面表现出优越性能

Conclusion: 该方法为多变量数据集提供了高效的压缩神经表示方案，在多个评估指标上达到最优表现

Abstract: The extensive adoption of Deep Neural Networks has led to their increased
utilization in challenging scientific visualization tasks. Recent advancements
in building compressed data models using implicit neural representations have
shown promising results for tasks like spatiotemporal volume visualization and
super-resolution. Inspired by these successes, we develop compressed neural
representations for multivariate datasets containing tens to hundreds of
variables. Our approach utilizes a single network to learn representations for
all data variables simultaneously through parameter sharing. This allows us to
achieve state-of-the-art data compression. Through comprehensive evaluations,
we demonstrate superior performance in terms of reconstructed data quality,
rendering and visualization quality, preservation of dependency information
among variables, and storage efficiency.

### [150] [An Empirical Study on MC Dropout--Based Uncertainty--Error Correlation in 2D Brain Tumor Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15541)
*Saumya B*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MC Dropout不确定性在脑肿瘤MRI分割中与分割错误的相关性较弱，特别是在肿瘤边界区域，表明该方法在定位边界错误方面效果有限


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估MC Dropout在脑肿瘤MRI分割中识别分割错误的有效性，特别是在肿瘤边界区域的不确定性估计能力

Method: 使用U-Net在四种数据增强设置下进行2D脑肿瘤MRI分割，通过50次随机前向传播计算不确定性，并使用Pearson和Spearman系数与像素级错误进行相关性分析

Result: 全局相关性较弱（r≈0.30-0.38），边界相关性可忽略（|r|<0.05），不同增强设置间的差异虽统计显著但缺乏实际意义

Conclusion: MC Dropout不确定性在定位边界错误方面提供有限线索，需要开发替代或混合的不确定性估计方法用于医学图像分割

Abstract: Accurate brain tumor segmentation from MRI is vital for diagnosis and
treatment planning. Although Monte Carlo (MC) Dropout is widely used to
estimate model uncertainty, its effectiveness in identifying segmentation
errors -- especially near tumor boundaries -- remains unclear. This study
empirically examines the relationship between MC Dropout--based uncertainty and
segmentation error in 2D brain tumor MRI segmentation using a U-Net trained
under four augmentation settings: none, horizontal flip, rotation, and scaling.
Uncertainty was computed from 50 stochastic forward passes and correlated with
pixel-wise errors using Pearson and Spearman coefficients. Results show weak
global correlations ($r \approx 0.30$--$0.38$) and negligible boundary
correlations ($|r| < 0.05$). Although differences across augmentations were
statistically significant ($p < 0.001$), they lacked practical relevance. These
findings suggest that MC Dropout uncertainty provides limited cues for boundary
error localization, underscoring the need for alternative or hybrid uncertainty
estimation methods in medical image segmentation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决由战略代理行为引起的内生处理分配问题，在保持双重稳健性的同时纳入战略考量。

Method: 整合战略均衡建模与双重稳健估计的框架，在战略无混淆性假设下进行理论分析。

Result: 实证评估显示SDR优于基线方法，在不同战略强度下实现7.6%-29.3%的偏差减少，并能随代理数量稳健扩展。

Conclusion: 该框架为代理对干预做出战略响应时的可靠因果推断提供了原则性方法。

Abstract: We introduce the Strategic Doubly Robust (SDR) estimator, a novel framework
that integrates strategic equilibrium modeling with doubly robust estimation
for causal inference in strategic environments. SDR addresses endogenous
treatment assignment arising from strategic agent behavior, maintaining double
robustness while incorporating strategic considerations. Theoretical analysis
confirms SDR's consistency and asymptotic normality under strategic
unconfoundedness. Empirical evaluations demonstrate SDR's superior performance
over baseline methods, achieving 7.6\%-29.3\% bias reduction across varying
strategic strengths and maintaining robust scalability with agent populations.
The framework provides a principled approach for reliable causal inference when
agents respond strategically to interventions.

### [152] [On the Neural Feature Ansatz for Deep Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15563)
*Edward Tansley,Estelle Massart,Coralia Cartis*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文证明了神经特征假设(NFA)在多层线性网络中的深度依赖性，发现NFA指数α=1/L，并展示了在非线性网络中NFA可能不成立的情况。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解深度神经网络的特征学习机制是建立数学基础的重要问题，神经特征假设(NFA)提供了分析第一层权重与输入梯度外积关系的理论框架。

Method: 使用梯度流动力学和平衡权重初始化，分析多层线性网络中的训练动态，并通过数值实验验证理论结果。

Result: 对于L层线性网络，NFA在整个训练过程中成立且指数α=1/L；对于不平衡初始化，应用权重衰减时NFA渐近成立；非线性网络中存在NFA不成立的例子。

Conclusion: NFA具有深度依赖性，在特定条件下对线性网络成立，但在非线性网络中可能失效，这为理解深度神经网络的特征学习提供了重要理论洞见。

Abstract: Understanding feature learning is an important open question in establishing
a mathematical foundation for deep neural networks. The Neural Feature Ansatz
(NFA) states that after training, the Gram matrix of the first-layer weights of
a deep neural network is proportional to some power $\alpha>0$ of the average
gradient outer product (AGOP) of this network with respect to its inputs.
Assuming gradient flow dynamics with balanced weight initialization, the NFA
was proven to hold throughout training for two-layer linear networks with
exponent $\alpha = 1/2$ (Radhakrishnan et al., 2024). We extend this result to
networks with $L \geq 2$ layers, showing that the NFA holds with exponent
$\alpha = 1/L$, thus demonstrating a depth dependency of the NFA. Furthermore,
we prove that for unbalanced initialization, the NFA holds asymptotically
through training if weight decay is applied. We also provide counterexamples
showing that the NFA does not hold for some network architectures with
nonlinear activations, even when these networks fit arbitrarily well the
training data. We thoroughly validate our theoretical results through numerical
experiments across a variety of optimization algorithms, weight decay rates and
initialization schemes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受迭代联合图传播(IJGP)算法启发，旨在通过神经网络方法提高#SAT问题的求解精度。

Method: 使用树分解将CNF公式编码为联合图，在图上执行迭代消息传递，通过学习配分函数来近似模型数量，并在联合图的簇内和簇间应用注意力机制。

Result: 实验表明Attn-JGNN模型比其他神经网络方法取得了更好的结果。

Conclusion: 注意力增强的联合图神经网络能有效提高#SAT问题的求解精度，注意力机制有助于关注关键变量和簇，减少冗余计算。

Abstract: We propose an Attention Enhanced Join-Graph Neural Networks(Attn-JGNN) model
for solving #SAT problems, which significantly improves the solving accuracy.
Inspired by the Iterative Join Graph Propagation (IJGP) algorithm, Attn-JGNN
uses tree decomposition to encode the CNF formula into a join-graph, then
performs iterative message passing on the join-graph, and finally approximates
the model number by learning partition functions. In order to further improve
the accuracy of the solution, we apply the attention mechanism in and between
clusters of the join-graphs, which makes Attn-JGNN pay more attention to the
key variables and clusters in probabilistic inference, and reduces the
redundant calculation. Finally, our experiments show that our Attn-JGNN model
achieves better results than other neural network methods.

*Jiahao Zhou,Chengliang Lin,Dingji Li,Mingkai Dong,Haibo Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GRATING是一个无需训练的高效推理系统，通过渐进式聚类剪枝和内存优化技术，显著降低语义Top-K选择任务的延迟和内存使用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语义Top-K选择在边缘设备上的延迟和内存需求占主导地位，但实际只需要相对排名而非精确分数，且中间层存在序列级稀疏性，为剪枝提供了机会。

Method: 采用整体前向传播，通过渐进式聚类剪枝减少延迟，使用双层滑动窗口和分块执行策略来限制峰值内存使用，并重叠I/O与计算。

Result: 在0.6B到8B参数的reranker上，GRATING在微基准测试中延迟降低高达89.0%，峰值内存降低高达94.9%，在三个实际应用中延迟降低11.6%-51.0%，内存降低18.6%-77.8%。

Conclusion: GRATING显著提高了边缘设备上语义Top-K选择的效率和可部署性，无需精度损失。

Abstract: Semantic top-K selection with cross-encoder rerankers underpins of on-device
AI services, such as retrieval-augmented generation, agent memory, and
personalized recommendation. However, its latency and memory demands dominate
end-to-end budgets on edge hardware. Revisiting the objective of top-K
selection, we reveal that only relative rankings matter, not exact
per-candidate scores. We further observe sequence-level sparsity: relative
rankings stabilize early in intermediate layers, allowing pruning opportunities
prior to completing full inference.
  Building on this insight, we propose monolithic forwarding and develop a
training-free inference system, GRATING. By maintaining a global view of all
candidates, it reduces latency through progressive cluster pruning. It also
bounds peak memory usage by strategically overlapping I/O with computation via
dual-layer sliding window and chunked execution. We evaluate GRATING against
state-of-the-art baselines on rerankers from 0.6B to 8B parameters across Apple
M2 and RTX 5070. GRATING consistently reduces latency by up to 89.0% and peak
memory by up to 94.9% in microbenchmarks, without any loss in precision. Across
three real-world on-device AI applications, GRATING lowers latency by
11.6%-51.0% and peak memory by 18.6%-77.8%, demonstrating substantial
improvements in efficiency and deployability.

TL;DR: 提出了CQD-SHAP框架，使用Shapley值计算复杂查询中各部分对答案排名的贡献，提高神经符号复杂查询回答的可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的复杂查询回答方法多为黑盒模型，缺乏可解释性。虽然神经符号方法如CQD允许跟踪中间结果，但无法解释查询各部分的重要性。

Method: 基于合作博弈论中的Shapley值，计算查询各部分对特定答案排名的贡献，满足所有基本Shapley公理。

Result: 在必要性和充分性解释方面的自动化评估显示，该方法对大多数查询类型都有效，优于各种基线方法。

Conclusion: CQD-SHAP框架成功解释了神经预测器从不完整知识图谱中推断新知识的价值，相比仅依赖现有事实的符号方法具有更好的可解释性。

Abstract: Complex query answering (CQA) goes beyond the well-studied link prediction
task by addressing more sophisticated queries that require multi-hop reasoning
over incomplete knowledge graphs (KGs). Research on neural and neurosymbolic
CQA methods is still an emerging field. Almost all of these methods can be
regarded as black-box models, which may raise concerns about user trust.
Although neurosymbolic approaches like CQD are slightly more interpretable,
allowing intermediate results to be tracked, the importance of different parts
of the query remains unexplained. In this paper, we propose CQD-SHAP, a novel
framework that computes the contribution of each query part to the ranking of a
specific answer. This contribution explains the value of leveraging a neural
predictor that can infer new knowledge from an incomplete KG, rather than a
symbolic approach relying solely on existing facts in the KG. CQD-SHAP is
formulated based on Shapley values from cooperative game theory and satisfies
all the fundamental Shapley axioms. Automated evaluation of these explanations
in terms of necessary and sufficient explanations, and comparisons with various
baselines, shows the effectiveness of this approach for most query types.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种高效的Tsetlin机器软件实现，通过位运算、提前退出机制和字面量重排序策略，在ARM处理器上实现高达96.71%的推理时间减少。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Tsetlin机器在资源受限设备上具有高速推理潜力，其逻辑驱动操作适合现代CPU架构的并行执行，因此需要优化实现以充分发挥性能。

Method: 使用指令级位运算进行紧凑模型表示和加速处理；引入基于AND子句评估的提前退出机制避免不必要计算；通过统计分析和Tsetlin自动机动作在训练后推理前阶段应用字面量重排序策略。

Result: 在ARM处理器上的实验结果显示，优化实现相比传统基于整数的TM实现减少了高达96.71%的推理时间，同时保持了相当的代码密度。

Conclusion: 提出的优化方法显著提升了Tsetlin机器的推理性能，使其更适合在资源受限设备上部署，同时保持了模型的紧凑性。

Abstract: The Tsetlin Machine (TM) offers high-speed inference on resource-constrained
devices such as CPUs. Its logic-driven operations naturally lend themselves to
parallel execution on modern CPU architectures. Motivated by this, we propose
an efficient software implementation of the TM by leveraging instruction-level
bitwise operations for compact model representation and accelerated processing.
To further improve inference speed, we introduce an early exit mechanism, which
exploits the TM's AND-based clause evaluation to avoid unnecessary
computations. Building upon this, we propose a literal Reorder strategy
designed to maximize the likelihood of early exits. This strategy is applied
during a post-training, pre-inference stage through statistical analysis of all
literals and the corresponding actions of their associated Tsetlin Automata
(TA), introducing negligible runtime overhead. Experimental results using the
gem5 simulator with an ARM processor show that our optimized implementation
reduces inference time by up to 96.71% compared to the conventional
integer-based TM implementations while maintaining comparable code density.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有乘法自由模型如DLGNs在训练时计算成本高，且无法很好地泛化到更多输入的逻辑块，需要更高效的梯度学习方法

Method: 使用Walsh-Assisted Relaxation for Probabilistic Look-Up Tables (WARP-LUTs)方法，这是一种新颖的基于梯度的技术，用更少的可训练参数高效学习逻辑门组合

Result: 在CIFAR-10上比DLGNs实现显著更快的收敛速度，同时保持可比较的准确率

Conclusion: WARP-LUTs方法展示了扩展到更高输入逻辑块的潜力，为在现代FPGA上高效部署及其实时科学应用提供了前景

Abstract: Fast and efficient machine learning is of growing interest to the scientific
community and has spurred significant research into novel model architectures
and hardware-aware design. Recent hard? and software co-design approaches have
demonstrated impressive results with entirely multiplication-free models.
Differentiable Logic Gate Networks (DLGNs), for instance, provide a
gradient-based framework for learning optimal combinations of low-level logic
gates, setting state-of-the-art trade-offs between accuracy, resource usage,
and latency. However, these models suffer from high computational cost during
training and do not generalize well to logic blocks with more inputs. In this
work, we introduce Walsh-Assisted Relaxation for Probabilistic Look-Up Tables
(WARP-LUTs) - a novel gradient-based method that efficiently learns
combinations of logic gates with substantially fewer trainable parameters. We
demonstrate that WARP-LUTs achieve significantly faster convergence on CIFAR-10
compared to DLGNs, while maintaining comparable accuracy. Furthermore, our
approach suggests potential for extension to higher-input logic blocks,
motivating future research on extremely efficient deployment on modern FPGAs
and its real-time science applications.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CarBoN是一个测试时校准框架，通过自适应调整模型参数来引导生成更可靠的推理路径，相比传统Best-of-N采样方法，在相同精度下可减少4倍采样次数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统测试时缩放方法如Best-of-N采样存在效率低下的问题，随着N增加收益递减，需要更高效的推理优化方法。

Method: 提出两阶段方法：先探索解空间，然后学习输入特定的温度T和偏移向量δ来校准logits，引导生成更可靠的推理路径。

Result: 在MATH-500和AIME-2024数据集上，CarBoN在达到相同精度时采样次数减少4倍，且在固定预算下通常获得更高精度。

Conclusion: CarBoN框架有效提高了推理效率，T和δ在平衡输出多样性和正确性方面发挥互补作用，且可泛化到束搜索等步骤级采样策略。

Abstract: Allocating more computation during inference time (test-time scaling)
improves language model performance, especially for reasoning tasks. However,
popular methods like Best-of-$N$ sampling often show diminishing returns as $N$
increases. To address this inefficiency, we introduce a general test-time
calibration framework that adaptively modifies the model toward high-reward
reasoning paths, with theoretical guarantees of improving the lower bound of
expected reward under finite sampling, all without large language model (LLM)
retraining. Within this framework, we propose CarBoN (Calibrated Best-of-$N$),
a two-phase method that first explores the solution space and then learns a
calibration of the logits via an input-specific temperature $T$ and additive
shift vector $\delta$, guiding generation toward more reliable reasoning.
Experiments on MATH-500 and AIME-2024 show that CarBoN improves efficiency,
with up to $4\times$ fewer rollouts to reach the same accuracy, while often
achieving higher accuracy under fixed budgets. We also analyze the
complementary roles of $T$ and $\delta$ in balancing output diversity and
correctness, and demonstrate that the framework also generalizes to step-level
sampling strategies such as beam search. For more information, please refer to

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统有限元方法分析IPMSM转子形状计算成本高，需要开发更快速、成本更低的替代方法。

Method: 开发自定义深度学习模型KS-Net，并与Cubic SVM、Quadratic SVM、Fine KNN、Cosine KNN和Fine Tree算法进行对比评估，使用9000个样本的平衡数据集和10折交叉验证。

Result: Cubic SVM和Quadratic SVM算法实现100%准确率，KS-Net模型达到99.98%准确率，仅有两个误分类，与传统方法具有竞争力。

Conclusion: 数据驱动方法可以高精度预测IPMSM转子形状，为加速电机设计过程、开发自动转子识别系统和数据驱动故障诊断提供了坚实基础。

Abstract: The demand for high efficiency and precise control in electric drive systems
has led to the widespread adoption of Interior Permanent Magnet Synchronous
Motors (IPMSMs). The performance of these motors is significantly influenced by
rotor geometry. Traditionally, rotor shape analysis has been conducted using
the finite element method (FEM), which involves high computational costs. This
study aims to classify the rotor shape (2D type, V type, Nabla type) of IPMSMs
using electromagnetic parameters through machine learning-based methods and to
demonstrate the applicability of this approach as an alternative to classical
methods. In this context, a custom deep learning model, KS-Net, developed by
the user, was comparatively evaluated against Cubic SVM, Quadratic SVM, Fine
KNN, Cosine KNN, and Fine Tree algorithms. The balanced dataset, consisting of
9,000 samples, was tested using 10-fold cross-validation, and performance
metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score were employed. The
results indicate that the Cubic SVM and Quadratic SVM algorithms classified all
samples flawlessly, achieving 100% accuracy, while the KS-Net model achieved
99.98% accuracy with only two misclassifications, demonstrating competitiveness
with classical methods. This study shows that the rotor shape of IPMSMs can be
predicted with high accuracy using data-driven approaches, offering a fast and
cost-effective alternative to FEM-based analyses. The findings provide a solid
foundation for accelerating motor design processes, developing automated rotor
identification systems, and enabling data-driven fault diagnosis in engineering
applications.

Motivation: 现有通用对抗扰动方法忽略领域特定约束，导致生成的对抗样本在实际应用中不可行或易被检测，限制了真实世界适用性。

Method: 提出约束对抗扰动(CAP)算法，基于增强拉格朗日最小最大优化框架，使用梯度交替优化策略，可处理多个复杂约束。

Conclusion: CAP方法成功解决了约束特征空间中的对抗攻击问题，并提供了从数据中学习特征约束的原则性方法，适用于具有结构化输入空间的广泛领域。

Abstract: Deep neural networks have achieved remarkable success in a wide range of
classification tasks. However, they remain highly susceptible to adversarial
examples - inputs that are subtly perturbed to induce misclassification while
appearing unchanged to humans. Among various attack strategies, Universal
Adversarial Perturbations (UAPs) have emerged as a powerful tool for both
stress testing model robustness and facilitating scalable adversarial training.
Despite their effectiveness, most existing UAP methods neglect domain specific
constraints that govern feature relationships. Violating such constraints, such
as debt to income ratios in credit scoring or packet flow invariants in network
communication, can render adversarial examples implausible or easily
detectable, thereby limiting their real world applicability.
  In this work, we advance universal adversarial attacks to constrained feature
spaces by formulating an augmented Lagrangian based min max optimization
problem that enforces multiple, potentially complex constraints of varying
importance. We propose Constrained Adversarial Perturbation (CAP), an efficient
algorithm that solves this problem using a gradient based alternating
optimization strategy. We evaluate CAP across diverse domains including
finance, IT networks, and cyber physical systems, and demonstrate that it
achieves higher attack success rates while significantly reducing runtime
compared to existing baselines. Our approach also generalizes seamlessly to
individual adversarial perturbations, where we observe similar strong
performance gains. Finally, we introduce a principled procedure for learning
feature constraints directly from data, enabling broad applicability across
domains with structured input spaces.

TL;DR: ProofOptimizer是首个无需人工监督即可简化Lean证明的语言模型，通过专家迭代和强化学习训练，在基准测试中显著压缩证明长度（miniF2F减少87%，PutnamBench减少57%，IMO 2025证明减少49%）


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经定理证明生成的证明虽然经过形式系统验证，但长度过长难以理解，限制了数学洞察力。证明简化是关键瓶颈，但训练数据稀缺，现有方法难以处理RL训练证明器生成的极长证明

Method: 通过专家迭代和强化学习训练ProofOptimizer模型，使用Lean验证简化并提供训练信号。在推理时采用迭代证明缩短工作流，逐步减少证明长度

Result: ProofOptimizer显著压缩了最先进RL训练证明器生成的证明：miniF2F减少87%，PutnamBench减少57%，Seed-Prover的IMO 2025证明减少49%。简化后的证明在Lean中检查更快，作为训练数据还能提升下游证明器性能

Conclusion: ProofOptimizer是首个无需人工监督的Lean证明简化模型，能有效解决神经定理证明中证明过长的问题，不仅使证明更简洁，还提高了验证效率和下游性能

Abstract: Neural theorem proving has advanced rapidly in the past year, reaching IMO
gold-medalist capabilities and producing formal proofs that span thousands of
lines. Although such proofs are mechanically verified by formal systems like
Lean, their excessive length renders them difficult for humans to comprehend
and limits their usefulness for mathematical insight. Proof simplification is
therefore a critical bottleneck. Yet, training data for this task is scarce,
and existing methods -- mainly agentic scaffolding with off-the-shelf LLMs --
struggle with the extremely long proofs generated by RL-trained provers. We
introduce ProofOptimizer, the first language model trained to simplify Lean
proofs without requiring additional human supervision. ProofOptimizer is
trained via expert iteration and reinforcement learning, using Lean to verify
simplifications and provide training signal. At inference time, it operates
within an iterative proof-shortening workflow, progressively reducing proof
length. Experiments show that ProofOptimizer substantially compresses proofs
generated by state-of-the-art RL-trained provers on standard benchmarks,
reducing proof length by 87% on miniF2F, 57% on PutnamBench, and 49% on
Seed-Prover's IMO 2025 proofs. Beyond conciseness, the simplified proofs check
faster in Lean and further improve downstream prover performance when reused as
training data for supervised finetuning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决强化学习系统的安全性问题，确保RL系统不仅性能最优，还能提供形式化的安全保证，使其安全部署。

Method: 将约束MDP状态空间增强风险预算，使用学习到的成本评论家对智能体策略分布应用屏蔽机制，确保所有采样动作在期望意义下保持安全。

Result: 在确定性环境中保持最优性，提供了仅依赖于备份评论家准确度的成本期望紧上界，实验表明在训练期间也能保证安全性。

Conclusion: ProSh是一种有效的模型无关安全强化学习方法，能够在训练和部署过程中提供形式化的安全保证。

Abstract: Safety is a major concern in reinforcement learning (RL): we aim at
developing RL systems that not only perform optimally, but are also safe to
deploy by providing formal guarantees about their safety. To this end, we
introduce Probabilistic Shielding via Risk Augmentation (ProSh), a model-free
algorithm for safe reinforcement learning under cost constraints. ProSh
augments the Constrained MDP state space with a risk budget and enforces safety
by applying a shield to the agent's policy distribution using a learned cost
critic. The shield ensures that all sampled actions remain safe in expectation.
We also show that optimality is preserved when the environment is
deterministic. Since ProSh is model-free, safety during training depends on the
knowledge we have acquired about the environment. We provide a tight
upper-bound on the cost in expectation, depending only on the backup-critic
accuracy, that is always satisfied during training. Under mild, practically
achievable assumptions, ProSh guarantees safety even at training time, as shown
in the experiments.

Result: 在离散和连续环境中的实验表明，该方法能够学习处理时序依赖任务的有效策略，优于传统奖励工程和基于自动机的基线方法。

Conclusion: 基于自动机偏好的方法为处理非马尔可夫奖励提供了一种可扩展、高效且不依赖人工的替代方案，并具有收敛性保证。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) in environments with complex, history-dependent
reward structures poses significant challenges for traditional methods. In this
work, we introduce a novel approach that leverages automaton-based feedback to
guide the learning process, replacing explicit reward functions with
preferences derived from a deterministic finite automaton (DFA). Unlike
conventional approaches that use automata for direct reward specification, our
method employs the structure of the DFA to generate preferences over
trajectories that are used to learn a reward function, eliminating the need for
manual reward engineering. Our framework introduces a static approach that uses
the learned reward function directly for policy optimization and a dynamic
approach that involves continuous refining of the reward function and policy
through iterative updates until convergence.
  Our experiments in both discrete and continuous environments demonstrate that
our approach enables the RL agent to learn effective policies for tasks with
temporal dependencies, outperforming traditional reward engineering and
automaton-based baselines such as reward machines and LTL-guided methods. Our
results highlight the advantages of automaton-based preferences in handling
non-Markovian rewards, offering a scalable, efficient, and human-independent
alternative to traditional reward modeling. We also provide a convergence
guarantee showing that under standard assumptions our automaton-guided
preference-based framework learns a policy that is near-optimal with respect to
the true non-Markovian objective.

*Nayan Kumar Singh*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文评估了图神经网络和3D U-Net作为参数化工字梁有限元分析的替代模型，发现GNN显著优于U-Net，其中消息传递神经网络和图变换器表现最佳，物理信息神经网络框架通过课程学习策略显著提升了泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 有限元分析在产品设计周期中计算成本高昂，不适合许多设计优化问题，深度学习模型可以成为很好的解决方案，但选择合适的架构来准确模拟FEA是一个挑战。

Method: 提出了基于Navier-Cauchy方程的物理信息神经网络框架，采用课程学习策略（先在数据上预训练，然后进行物理信息微调）来稳定训练，比较了图神经网络和3D U-Net作为FEA替代模型的性能。

Result: GNN显著优于U-Net，最差的GCN框架相对L2误差为8.7%，而最好的U-Net为13.0%。消息传递神经网络和图变换器分别达到3.5%和2.6%的误差。PINN框架将泛化误差降低了11.3%。图变换器最准确但推理速度比MPNN慢37.5%。

Conclusion: PINN增强的MPNN提供了最实用的解决方案，在预测性能、模型大小和推理速度之间实现了良好平衡。

Abstract: Although Finite Element Analysis (FEA) is an integral part of the product
design lifecycle, the analysis is computationally expensive, making it
unsuitable for many design optimization problems. The deep learning models can
be a great solution. However, selecting the architecture that emulates the FEA
with great accuracy is a challenge. This paper presents a comprehensive
evaluation of graph neural networks (GNNs) and 3D U-Nets as surrogates for FEA
of parametric I-beams. We introduce a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN)
framework, governed by the Navier Cauchy equations, to enforce physical laws.
Crucially, we demonstrate that a curriculum learning strategy, pretraining on
data followed by physics informed fine tuning, is essential for stabilizing
training. Our results show that GNNs fundamentally outperform the U-Net. Even
the worst performer among GNNs, the GCN framework, achieved a relative L2 error
of 8.7% while the best framework among U Net, U Net with attention mechanism
trained on high resolution data, achieved 13.0% score. Among the graph-based
architectures, the Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNN) and Graph
Transformers achieved the highest accuracy, achieving a relative L2 score of
3.5% and 2.6% respectively. The inclusion of physics fundamental laws (PINN)
significantly improved the generalization, reducing error by up to 11.3% on
high-signal tasks. While the Graph Transformer is the most accurate model, it
is more 37.5% slower during inference when compared to second best model, MPNN
PINN. The PINN enhanced MPNN (MPNN PINN) provides the most practical solution.
It offers a good compromise between predictive performance, model size, and
inference speed.

TL;DR: 提出Sphere-Adaptive Mixup (SAMix)方法，通过自适应混合策略提升持续学习中的模型校准度和性能，减少过自信和遗忘问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有持续学习方法主要关注减轻遗忘和提高准确率，但忽视了网络校准这一重要方面。神经崩溃现象在持续学习中显示出优势，但很少有工作致力于改善持续模型的校准度以实现更可靠的预测。

Method: 提出了Sphere-Adaptive Mixup (SAMix)，一种针对神经崩溃方法的自适应混合策略。该方法根据神经崩溃下特征空间的几何特性调整混合过程，确保更稳健的正则化和对齐。

Result: 实验表明SAMix显著提升了性能，在持续学习中超越了最先进方法，同时改善了模型校准度。提高了跨任务准确率和预测的可靠性。

Conclusion: SAMix是持续学习系统稳健性方面的一个有前景的进展，能够同时提升准确率和预测可靠性。

Abstract: While most continual learning methods focus on mitigating forgetting and
improving accuracy, they often overlook the critical aspect of network
calibration, despite its importance. Neural collapse, a phenomenon where
last-layer features collapse to their class means, has demonstrated advantages
in continual learning by reducing feature-classifier misalignment. Few works
aim to improve the calibration of continual models for more reliable
predictions. Our work goes a step further by proposing a novel method that not
only enhances calibration but also improves performance by reducing
overconfidence, mitigating forgetting, and increasing accuracy. We introduce
Sphere-Adaptive Mixup (SAMix), an adaptive mixup strategy tailored for neural
collapse-based methods. SAMix adapts the mixing process to the geometric
properties of feature spaces under neural collapse, ensuring more robust
regularization and alignment. Experiments show that SAMix significantly boosts
performance, surpassing SOTA methods in continual learning while also improving
model calibration. SAMix enhances both across-task accuracy and the broader
reliability of predictions, making it a promising advancement for robust
continual learning systems.

Abstract: Poultry farming faces increasing pressure to meet productivity targets while
ensuring animal welfare and environmental compliance. Yet many small and
medium-sized farms lack affordable, integrated tools for continuous monitoring
and decision-making, relying instead on manual, reactive inspections. This
paper presents Poultry Farm Intelligence (PoultryFI) - a modular,
cost-effective platform that integrates six AI-powered modules: Camera
Placement Optimizer, Audio-Visual Monitoring, Analytics & Alerting, Real-Time
Egg Counting, Production & Profitability Forecasting, and a Recommendation
Module.
  Camera layouts are first optimized offline using evolutionary algorithms for
full poultry house coverage with minimal hardware. The Audio-Visual Monitoring
module extracts welfare indicators from synchronized video, audio, and feeding
data. Analytics & Alerting produces daily summaries and real-time
notifications, while Real-Time Egg Counting uses an edge vision model to
automate production tracking. Forecasting models predict egg yield and feed
consumption up to 10 days in advance, and the Recommendation Module integrates
forecasts with weather data to guide environmental and operational adjustments.
  This is among the first systems to combine low-cost sensing, edge analytics,
and prescriptive AI to continuously monitor flocks, predict production, and
optimize performance. Field trials demonstrate 100% egg-count accuracy on
Raspberry Pi 5, robust anomaly detection, and reliable short-term forecasting.
PoultryFI bridges the gap between isolated pilot tools and scalable, farm-wide
intelligence, empowering producers to proactively safeguard welfare and
profitability.

Motivation: 现有预训练时间序列模型主要关注单变量预测，限制了其在包含多变量数据和协变量的真实场景中的适用性。

Method: 使用组注意力机制促进上下文学习，通过在组内多个时间序列之间高效共享信息；通过在单变量序列上施加多样化多变量结构的合成数据集进行训练。

Abstract: Pretrained time series models have enabled inference-only forecasting systems
that produce accurate predictions without task-specific training. However,
existing approaches largely focus on univariate forecasting, limiting their
applicability in real-world scenarios where multivariate data and covariates
play a crucial role. We present Chronos-2, a pretrained model capable of
handling univariate, multivariate, and covariate-informed forecasting tasks in
a zero-shot manner. Chronos-2 employs a group attention mechanism that
facilitates in-context learning (ICL) through efficient information sharing
across multiple time series within a group, which may represent sets of related
series, variates of a multivariate series, or targets and covariates in a
forecasting task. These general capabilities are achieved through training on
synthetic datasets that impose diverse multivariate structures on univariate
series. Chronos-2 delivers state-of-the-art performance across three
comprehensive benchmarks: fev-bench, GIFT-Eval, and Chronos Benchmark II. On
fev-bench, which emphasizes multivariate and covariate-informed forecasting,
Chronos-2's universal ICL capabilities lead to substantial improvements over
existing models. On tasks involving covariates, it consistently outperforms
baselines by a wide margin. Case studies in the energy and retail domains
further highlight its practical advantages. The in-context learning
capabilities of Chronos-2 establish it as a general-purpose forecasting model
that can be used "as is" in real-world forecasting pipelines.

TL;DR: 论文提出SNOO优化器，通过将Nesterov动量应用于伪梯度，在非分布式设置中实现了1.5-2.5倍的计算效率提升，且改进效果随模型规模增大而增强。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DiLoCo优化器在非分布式设置中表现出色，但其有效性来源尚不明确。本研究旨在探究DiLoCo成功的关键因素，并开发更高效的优化技术。

Method: 提出Step-K Nesterov Outer Optimizer (SNOO)，将Nesterov动量应用于Lookahead优化器的伪梯度更新过程。该方法采用双循环框架，在快速权重上执行多个内部优化器步骤生成伪梯度轨迹，然后用Nesterov动量更新慢速权重。

Result: SNOO在非分布式设置中实现了1.5-2.5倍的计算因子增益，训练规模可达1e23 FLOPs。改进效果随模型规模增大而增强，且与AdamW、Muon等多种内部优化器兼容。

Conclusion: DiLoCo的有效性主要源于对伪梯度应用Nesterov动量。SNOO因其最小的计算和内存开销以及与模型分片的兼容性，成为各种内部优化器的实用增强方案。

Abstract: The rapid development of large language models (LLMs) has driven the demand
for more efficient optimization techniques. Among these, the Lookahead family
of optimizers employs a two-loop framework, maintaining fast and slow sets of
model weights. Multiple inner optimizer steps on the fast weights produce a
trajectory - the pseudo-gradient - that is used to update the slow weights.
DiLoCo, a notable example originally designed for distributed training, applies
Nesterov momentum to the averaged pseudo-gradient from multiple workers,
claiming to even outperform AdamW in a non-distributed setup. In this paper, we
empirically show that DiLoCo's surprising effectiveness stems primarily from
applying Nesterov momentum to the pseudo-gradient, which improves training in a
non-distributed setting. We call this Lookahead variant the Step-$K$ Nesterov
Outer Optimizer (SNOO). We demonstrate that SNOO achieves compute factor gains
of 1.5 - 2.5$\times$ in a non-distributed setting up to a scale of 1e23
training FLOPs, with improvements that increase with model size. Because of its
minimal compute and memory overhead and compatibility with model sharding, SNOO
is a practical enhancement for a variety of inner optimizers, including AdamW
and Muon.

Conclusion: FIDDLE是首个直接最大化过程保真度的方法，在路由阶段优化方面优于依赖间接指标的传统方法

Abstract: Quantum computing has the potential to revolutionize fields like quantum
optimization and quantum machine learning. However, current quantum devices are
hindered by noise, reducing their reliability. A key challenge in gate-based
quantum computing is improving the reliability of quantum circuits, measured by
process fidelity, during the transpilation process, particularly in the routing
stage. In this paper, we address the Fidelity Maximization in Routing Stage
(FMRS) problem by introducing FIDDLE, a novel learning framework comprising two
modules: a Gaussian Process-based surrogate model to estimate process fidelity
with limited training samples and a reinforcement learning module to optimize
routing. Our approach is the first to directly maximize process fidelity,
outperforming traditional methods that rely on indirect metrics such as circuit
depth or gate count. We rigorously evaluate FIDDLE by comparing it with
state-of-the-art fidelity estimation techniques and routing optimization
methods. The results demonstrate that our proposed surrogate model is able to
provide a better estimation on the process fidelity compared to existing
learning techniques, and our end-to-end framework significantly improves the
process fidelity of quantum circuits across various noise models.

Conclusion: TRON为跨物种迁移学习提供了生物学基础和可解释的方法，为更有效利用转录组数据铺平了道路。

Abstract: We present Transfer Orthology Networks (TRON), a novel neural network
architecture designed for cross-species transfer learning. TRON leverages
orthologous relationships, represented as a bipartite graph between species, to
guide knowledge transfer. Specifically, we prepend a learned species conversion
layer, whose weights are masked by the biadjacency matrix of this bipartite
graph, to a pre-trained feedforward neural network that predicts a phenotype
from gene expression data in a source species. This allows for efficient
transfer of knowledge to a target species by learning a linear transformation
that maps gene expression from the source to the target species' gene space.
The learned weights of this conversion layer offer a potential avenue for
interpreting functional orthology, providing insights into how genes across
species contribute to the phenotype of interest. TRON offers a biologically
grounded and interpretable approach to cross-species transfer learning, paving
the way for more effective utilization of available transcriptomic data. We are
in the process of collecting cross-species transcriptomic/phenotypic data to
gain experimental validation of the TRON architecture.

Abstract: Random Utility Models (RUMs) are a classical framework for modeling user
preferences and play a key role in reward modeling for Reinforcement Learning
from Human Feedback (RLHF). However, a crucial shortcoming of many of these
techniques is the Independence of Irrelevant Alternatives (IIA) assumption,
which collapses \emph{all} human preferences to a universal underlying utility
function, yielding a coarse approximation of the range of human preferences. On
the other hand, statistical and computational guarantees for models avoiding
this assumption are scarce. In this paper, we investigate the statistical and
computational challenges of learning a \emph{correlated} probit model, a
fundamental RUM that avoids the IIA assumption. First, we establish that the
classical data collection paradigm of pairwise preference data is
\emph{fundamentally insufficient} to learn correlational information,
explaining the lack of statistical and computational guarantees in this
setting. Next, we demonstrate that \emph{best-of-three} preference data
provably overcomes these shortcomings, and devise a statistically and
computationally efficient estimator with near-optimal performance. These
results highlight the benefits of higher-order preference data in learning
correlated utilities, allowing for more fine-grained modeling of human
preferences. Finally, we validate these theoretical guarantees on several
real-world datasets, demonstrating improved personalization of human
preferences.

Conclusion: 该混合方法在优化代理和经典求解器之间实现了良好的平衡，提供了可解释的速度-最优性权衡，能够基于用户定义的最优性阈值实现可信部署。

Abstract: Recent research has shown that optimization proxies can be trained to high
fidelity, achieving average optimality gaps under 1% for large-scale problems.
However, worst-case analyses show that there exist in-distribution queries that
result in orders of magnitude higher optimality gap, making it difficult to
trust the predictions in practice. This paper aims at striking a balance
between classical solvers and optimization proxies in order to enable
trustworthy deployments with interpretable speed-optimality tradeoffs based on
a user-defined optimality threshold. To this end, the paper proposes a hybrid
solver that leverages duality theory to efficiently bound the optimality gap of
predictions, falling back to a classical solver for queries where optimality
cannot be certified. To improve the achieved speedup of the hybrid solver, the
paper proposes an alternative training procedure that combines the primal and
dual proxy training. Experiments on large-scale transmission systems show that
the hybrid solver is highly scalable. The proposed hybrid solver achieves
speedups of over 1000x compared to a parallelized simplex-based solver while
guaranteeing a maximum optimality gap of 2%.

TL;DR: OpenEstimate是一个用于评估语言模型在不确定性下进行数值估计任务的多领域基准测试，发现前沿语言模型的概率先验通常不准确且过度自信。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界部署的语言模型需要处理不完整信息和不确定性推理，但现有评估主要关注有明确答案的问题，缺乏对不确定性推理能力的系统性评估。

Method: 构建OpenEstimate基准测试，通过数值估计任务评估语言模型，要求模型综合大量背景信息并表达概率先验，评估这些先验的准确性和校准度。

Result: 在六个前沿语言模型上的测试显示，模型产生的先验通常不准确且过度自信，性能对不确定性提取方式有轻微改善，但基本不受采样策略、推理努力或提示设计变化的影响。

Conclusion: OpenEstimate为前沿语言模型提供了一个具有挑战性的评估平台，并为开发更好的概率估计和不确定性推理模型奠定了基础。

Abstract: Real-world settings where language models (LMs) are deployed -- in domains
spanning healthcare, finance, and other forms of knowledge work -- require
models to grapple with incomplete information and reason under uncertainty. Yet
most LM evaluations focus on problems with well-defined answers and success
criteria. This gap exists in part because natural problems involving
uncertainty are difficult to construct: given that LMs have access to most of
the same knowledge as humans, it is non-trivial to design questions for which
LMs will struggle to produce correct answers, but which humans can answer
reliably. As a result, LM performance on reasoning under uncertainty remains
poorly characterized. To address this gap, we introduce OpenEstimate, an
extensible, multi-domain benchmark for evaluating LMs on numerical estimation
tasks that require models to synthesize significant amounts of background
information and express predictions as probabilistic priors. We assess these
priors for accuracy and calibration, quantifying their usefulness relative to
samples from the true distribution of interest. Across six frontier LMs, we
find that LM-elicited priors are often inaccurate and overconfident.
Performance improves modestly depending on how uncertainty is elicited from the
model, but is largely unaffected by changes in sampling strategy, reasoning
effort, or prompt design. The OpenEstimate benchmark thus offers a challenging
evaluation for frontier LMs and a platform for developing models that are
better at probabilistic estimation and reasoning under uncertainty.

hummingbird is trained using the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm
from the Unity ML-Agents toolkit. It learns to navigate through the terrain
efficiently, locate flowers, and collect them while adapting to the
ever-changing procedural layout of the island. The island agent is also trained
using the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm. It learns to generate
flower layouts based on observed obstacle positions, the hummingbird's initial
state, and performance feedback from previous episodes. The interaction between
these agents leads to emergent behavior and robust generalization across
various environmental configurations. The results demonstrate that the approach
not only produces effective and efficient agent behavior but also opens up new
opportunities for autonomous game level design driven by machine learning. This
work highlights the potential of DRL in enabling intelligent agents to both
generate and solve content in virtual environments, pushing the boundaries of
what AI can contribute to creative game development processes.

### [178] [Towards Error Centric Intelligence I, Beyond Observational Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15128)
*Marcus A. Thomas*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文认为AGI发展的瓶颈在于理论而非数据或规模，提出基于批判理性主义的因果力学框架，强调假设空间变化作为首要操作，通过模块化干预和错误发现机制来解决观测学习的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 挑战柏拉图表示假说，指出仅凭观测充分性无法保证干预能力，因为观测等价的世界在干预下可能产生分歧，因此需要从观测学习转向错误中心的范式。

Method: 提出因果力学框架，将假设空间变化作为核心操作，引入局部性自治原则、独立因果机制和组合自治原则等结构原则，使错误发现和修正变得可行。

Result: 建立了能够将不可达错误转化为可达错误并修正它们的理论框架，提供了可操作诊断工具。

Conclusion: AGI发展需要理论突破，因果力学为构建能够主动发现和修正错误的智能系统提供了理论支架，强调假设空间动态演化的重要性。

Abstract: We argue that progress toward AGI is theory limited rather than data or scale
limited. Building on the critical rationalism of Popper and Deutsch, we
challenge the Platonic Representation Hypothesis. Observationally equivalent
worlds can diverge under interventions, so observational adequacy alone cannot
guarantee interventional competence. We begin by laying foundations,
definitions of knowledge, learning, intelligence, counterfactual competence and
AGI, and then analyze the limits of observational learning that motivate an
error centric shift. We recast the problem as three questions about how
explicit and implicit errors evolve under an agent's actions, which errors are
unreachable within a fixed hypothesis space, and how conjecture and criticism
expand that space. From these questions we propose Causal Mechanics, a
mechanisms first program in which hypothesis space change is a first class
operation and probabilistic structure is used when useful rather than presumed.
We advance structural principles that make error discovery and correction
tractable, including a differential Locality and Autonomy Principle for modular
interventions, a gauge invariant form of Independent Causal Mechanisms for
separability, and the Compositional Autonomy Principle for analogy
preservation, together with actionable diagnostics. The aim is a scaffold for
systems that can convert unreachable errors into reachable ones and correct
them.

Motivation: 当前大型语言模型虽然能大规模近似人类响应，但主要反映群体共识，缺乏对个体推理风格和信念轨迹的个性化捕捉。

Method: 采用双轨设计：合成轨道用于规模化和系统性压力测试，人类轨道用于生态有效的"出声思考"推理数据收集。

Result: 实验显示最先进的LLM在个体适应方面仍存在持续差距，HugAgent成为首个可扩展的机器推理与人类个体思维对齐基准。

Conclusion: HugAgent为机器推理与人类个体思维的对齐提供了首个可扩展的评估基准，推动了更人性化推理AI的发展。

Abstract: Simulating human reasoning in open-ended tasks has been a long-standing
aspiration in AI and cognitive science. While large language models now
approximate human responses at scale, they remain tuned to population-level
consensus, often erasing the individuality of reasoning styles and belief
trajectories. To advance the vision of more human-like reasoning in machines,
we introduce HugAgent (Human-Grounded Agent Benchmark), a benchmark for
average-to-individual reasoning adaptation. The task is to predict how a
specific person would reason and update their beliefs in novel scenarios, given
partial evidence of their past views. HugAgent adopts a dual-track design: a
synthetic track for scale and systematic stress tests, and a human track for
ecologically valid, "out-loud" reasoning data. This design enables scalable,
reproducible evaluation of intra-agent fidelity: whether models can capture not
just what people believe, but how their reasoning evolves. Experiments with
state-of-the-art LLMs reveal persistent adaptation gaps, positioning HugAgent
as the first extensible benchmark for aligning machine reasoning with the
individuality of human thought. Our benchmark and chatbot are open-sourced as
HugAgent (https://anonymous.4open.science/r/HugAgent) and TraceYourThinking

Motivation: 解决真实工作环境中情绪识别面临的挑战，特别是缺乏大规模、长期自然环境下收集的数据集的问题。

Method: 在真实办公室环境中收集面部表情数据，使用深度学习进行情绪识别，计算情绪概率和扩展情绪指标，并进行技术验证和基线实验。

Abstract: Automated emotion recognition in real-world workplace settings remains a
challenging problem in affective computing due to the scarcity of large-scale,
longitudinal datasets collected in naturalistic environments. We present a
novel dataset comprising 733,651 facial expression records from 38 employees
collected over 30.5 months (November 2021 to May 2024) in an authentic office
environment. Each record contains seven emotion probabilities (neutral, happy,
sad, surprised, fear, disgusted, angry) derived from deep learning-based facial
expression recognition, along with comprehensive metadata including job roles,
employment outcomes, and personality traits. The dataset uniquely spans the
COVID-19 pandemic period, capturing emotional responses to major societal
events including the Shanghai lockdown and policy changes. We provide 32
extended emotional metrics computed using established affective science
methods, including valence, arousal, volatility, predictability, inertia, and
emotional contagion strength. Technical validation demonstrates high data
quality through successful replication of known psychological patterns (weekend
effect: +192% valence improvement, p < 0.001; diurnal rhythm validated) and
perfect predictive validity for employee turnover (AUC=1.0). Baseline
experiments using Random Forest and LSTM models achieve 91.2% accuracy for
emotion classification and R2 = 0.84 for valence prediction. This is the
largest and longest longitudinal workplace emotion dataset publicly available,
enabling research in emotion recognition, affective dynamics modeling,
emotional contagion, turnover prediction, and emotion-aware system design.

*Brett Reynolds*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出AGI评估应基于稳态属性簇概念，采用因果中心性权重和持久性测试，而非对称权重和快照评分，以减少脆弱性和博弈行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AGI评估使用对称权重和快照评分，忽视了不同领域的重要性差异和能力的持久性，无法区分稳定能力和脆弱表现。

Method: 提出两种评估扩展：基于CHC理论推导的因果中心性权重评分，以及包含剖面持久性、持久学习和错误纠正的簇稳定性指数家族。

Result: 这些方法在保持多领域广度的同时，能够减少评估的脆弱性和博弈行为，提供更可靠的AGI能力评估。

Conclusion: AGI评估应关注能力的持久性和稳定性，采用基于稳态属性簇的评估框架，实验室可在不访问架构的情况下采用这些黑盒协议。

Abstract: Contemporary AGI evaluations report multidomain capability profiles, yet they
typically assign symmetric weights and rely on snapshot scores. This creates
two problems: (i) equal weighting treats all domains as equally important when
human intelligence research suggests otherwise, and (ii) snapshot testing can't
distinguish durable capabilities from brittle performances that collapse under
delay or stress. I argue that general intelligence -- in humans and potentially
in machines -- is better understood as a homeostatic property cluster: a set of
abilities plus the mechanisms that keep those abilities co-present under
perturbation. On this view, AGI evaluation should weight domains by their
causal centrality (their contribution to cluster stability) and require
evidence of persistence across sessions. I propose two battery-compatible
extensions: a centrality-prior score that imports CHC-derived weights with
transparent sensitivity analysis, and a Cluster Stability Index family that
separates profile persistence, durable learning, and error correction. These
additions preserve multidomain breadth while reducing brittleness and gaming. I
close with testable predictions and black-box protocols labs can adopt without
architectural access.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在大数据时代，从海量、异构、复杂关联的多维数据中提取深度洞察面临挑战。LLM存在幻觉问题且难以实时更新，知识图谱的静态特性限制了动态交互和分析能力。

Method: 利用LLM代理从非结构化数据自动提取产品数据，实时构建和可视化知识图谱，通过交互平台支持用户对图节点进行深度探索分析。

Result: 实验结果表明该方法在产品生态系统分析、关系挖掘和用户驱动探索分析方面具有显著优势。

Conclusion: 该方法为多维数据分析提供了新思路和工具，构建了动态协作的分析生态系统。

Abstract: In the current era of big data, extracting deep insights from massive,
heterogeneous, and complexly associated multi-dimensional data has become a
significant challenge. Large Language Models (LLMs) perform well in natural
language understanding and generation, but still suffer from "hallucination"
issues when processing structured knowledge and are difficult to update in
real-time. Although Knowledge Graphs (KGs) can explicitly store structured
knowledge, their static nature limits dynamic interaction and analytical
capabilities. Therefore, this paper proposes a multi-dimensional data analysis
method based on the interactions between LLM agents and KGs, constructing a
dynamic, collaborative analytical ecosystem. This method utilizes LLM agents to
automatically extract product data from unstructured data, constructs and
visualizes the KG in real-time, and supports users in deep exploration and
analysis of graph nodes through an interactive platform. Experimental results
show that this method has significant advantages in product ecosystem analysis,
relationship mining, and user-driven exploratory analysis, providing new ideas
and tools for multi-dimensional data analysis.

TL;DR: KG-Agent是一个经验驱动的学习框架，通过构建状态-动作知识图谱来解决无API环境下LLM代理的效率瓶颈问题，在复杂GUI决策环境中显著提升探索效率和战略深度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有软件大多缺乏可访问的API，代理只能通过像素级GUI操作，导致LLM代理面临严重效率瓶颈：局限于局部视觉体验、短视决策和低效试错，阻碍技能获取和长期规划。

Method: 提出KG-Agent框架，将原始像素级交互结构化到持久的状态-动作知识图谱(SA-KG)中，通过连接功能相似但视觉不同的GUI状态构建经验邻域，并设计基于图拓扑的混合内在奖励机制。

Result: 在Civilization V和Slay the Spire两个复杂开放GUI决策环境中评估，相比最先进方法在探索效率和战略深度方面取得显著改进。

Conclusion: KG-Agent通过结构化经验和解耦战略规划与纯探索，有效解决了无API环境下LLM代理的效率瓶颈问题，实现了更好的长期规划和决策能力。

Abstract: Most existing software lacks accessible Application Programming Interfaces
(APIs), requiring agents to operate solely through pixel-based Graphical User
Interfaces (GUIs). In this API-free setting, large language model (LLM)-based
agents face severe efficiency bottlenecks: limited to local visual experiences,
they make myopic decisions and rely on inefficient trial-and-error, hindering
both skill acquisition and long-term planning. To address these challenges, we
propose KG-Agent, an experience-driven learning framework that structures an
agent's raw pixel-level interactions into a persistent State-Action Knowledge
Graph (SA-KG). KG-Agent overcomes inefficient exploration by linking
functionally similar but visually distinct GUI states, forming a rich
neighborhood of experience that enables the agent to generalize from a diverse
set of historical strategies. To support long-horizon reasoning, we design a
hybrid intrinsic reward mechanism based on the graph topology, combining a
state value reward for exploiting known high-value pathways with a novelty
reward that encourages targeted exploration. This approach decouples strategic
planning from pure discovery, allowing the agent to effectively value setup
actions with delayed gratification. We evaluate KG-Agent in two complex,
open-ended GUI-based decision-making environments (Civilization V and Slay the
Spire), demonstrating significant improvements in exploration efficiency and
strategic depth over the state-of-the-art methods.

Method: 系统包含4个循环阶段：编码（理解输入）、存储记忆（保存重要信息）、检索（从记忆中搜索相关上下文）、行动（执行任务）。使用图结构的多模态上下文记忆，将信息概念化为语义标签并与上下文关联。

Result: 在ImageNet分类任务中比传统多模态RAG方法快3.5倍，在MSC基准测试中优于MemGPT。

Conclusion: 提出的多模态智能体系统AUGUSTUS在性能和效率上都优于现有方法，验证了图结构多模态上下文记忆的有效性。

Abstract: Riding on the success of LLMs with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG),
there has been a growing interest in augmenting agent systems with external
memory databases. However, the existing systems focus on storing text
information in their memory, ignoring the importance of multimodal signals.
Motivated by the multimodal nature of human memory, we present AUGUSTUS, a
multimodal agent system aligned with the ideas of human memory in cognitive
science. Technically, our system consists of 4 stages connected in a loop: (i)
encode: understanding the inputs; (ii) store in memory: saving important
information; (iii) retrieve: searching for relevant context from memory; and
(iv) act: perform the task. Unlike existing systems that use vector databases,
we propose conceptualizing information into semantic tags and associating the
tags with their context to store them in a graph-structured multimodal
contextual memory for efficient concept-driven retrieval. Our system
outperforms the traditional multimodal RAG approach while being 3.5 times
faster for ImageNet classification and outperforming MemGPT on the MSC
benchmark.

Abstract: Witnessed by the recent advancements on leveraging LLM for coding and

for instruction-to-HTML generation that enhances both data quality and
evaluation granularity. WebGen-V contributes three key innovations: (1) an
unbounded and extensible agentic crawling framework that continuously collects
real-world webpages and can leveraged to augment existing benchmarks; (2) a
structured, section-wise data representation that integrates metadata,
localized UI screenshots, and JSON-formatted text and image assets, explicit
alignment between content, layout, and visual components for detailed
multimodal supervision; and (3) a section-level multimodal evaluation protocol
aligning text, layout, and visuals for high-granularity assessment. Experiments
with state-of-the-art LLMs and ablation studies validate the effectiveness of
our structured data and section-wise evaluation, as well as the contribution of
each component. To the best of our knowledge, WebGen-V is the first work to
enable high-granularity agentic crawling and evaluation for instruction-to-HTML
generation, providing a unified pipeline from real-world data acquisition and

Motivation: 当前多模态大模型的数据增强方法存在视觉感知不足导致的事实错误和幻觉问题，需要提升SFT数据质量。

Method: 利用视觉识别模型和OCR提取结构化视觉先验，结合三个LMM评估原始答案，通过统计融合得到共识分数作为真实标签，训练轻量级评论模型，最后选择最高分答案作为精炼结果。

Result: 在六个多模态基准测试中，使用VERITAS处理数据微调的模型性能优于使用原始数据的模型，特别是在文本丰富和细粒度推理任务中。评论模型能力接近最先进LMM但效率更高。

Conclusion: VERITAS能有效提升多模态数据质量，发布的管道、数据集和模型检查点将推动多模态数据优化研究。

Abstract: The quality of supervised fine-tuning (SFT) data is crucial for the
performance of large multimodal models (LMMs), yet current data enhancement
methods often suffer from factual errors and hallucinations due to inadequate
visual perception. To address this challenge, we propose VERITAS, a pipeline
that systematically integrates vision priors and multiple state-of-the-art LMMs
with statistical methods to enhance SFT data quality. VERITAS leverages visual
recognition models (RAM++) and OCR systems (PP-OCRv4) to extract structured
vision priors, which are combined with images, questions, and answers. Three
LMMs (GPT-4o, Gemini-2.5-Pro, Doubao-1.5-pro) evaluate the original answers,
providing critique rationales and scores that are statistically fused into a
high-confidence consensus score serving as ground truth. Using this consensus,
we train a lightweight critic model via Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO), enhancing reasoning capabilities efficiently. Each LMM then refines the
original answers based on the critiques, generating new candidate answers; we
select the highest-scoring one as the final refined answer. Experiments across
six multimodal benchmarks demonstrate that models fine-tuned with data
processed by VERITAS consistently outperform those using raw data, particularly
in text-rich and fine-grained reasoning tasks. Our critic model exhibits
enhanced capability comparable to state-of-the-art LMMs while being
significantly more efficient. We release our pipeline, datasets, and model
checkpoints to advance research in multimodal data optimization.

Motivation: 现有强化学习算法虽然提高了模型准确性，但存在响应过长和过度思考问题，导致推理延迟和计算消耗增加，特别是对于简单任务。

Result: 在DeepSeek-Distill-Qwen-7B和1.5B模型上，DEPO实现了序列长度减少39%，减少了低效token中的过度推理路径，同时整体准确性优于基准模型。

Conclusion: DEPO框架有效解决了大推理模型中的低效推理问题，在保持准确性的同时显著降低了推理成本和延迟。

Abstract: Recent Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have achieved remarkable performance in
solving complex problems via supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement
learning (RL). Although existing RL algorithms significantly enhance model
accuracy, they still suffer from excessively lengthy responses and overthinking
issues, resulting in increased inference latency and computational consumption,
especially for simple tasks that require minimal reasoning. To address this, we
propose a novel RL framework, DEPO, to reduce inefficient reasoning for models.
Our method mainly consists of three core components: (1) an innovative
advantage decoupled algorithm to guide model reduction of inefficient tokens;
(2) a difficulty-aware length penalty to lower the overall length of model
responses; (3) an advantage clipping method to prevent bias in policy
optimization. In our experiments, applied to DeepSeek-Distill-Qwen-7B and
DeepSeek-Distill-Qwen-1.5B as base models, DEPO achieves a significant
reduction in sequence length by 39% and reduces excessive reasoning paths in
inefficient tokens, while outperforming the base model in overall accuracy.

Abstract: The adoption of machine learning-based techniques for analog integrated
circuit layout, unlike its digital counterpart, has been limited by the
stringent requirements imposed by electric and problem-specific constraints,
along with the interdependence of floorplanning and routing steps. In this
work, we address a prevalent concern among layout engineers regarding the need
for readily available routing-aware floorplanning solutions. To this extent, we
develop an automatic floorplanning engine based on reinforcement learning and
relational graph convolutional neural network specifically tailored to
condition the floorplan generation towards more routable outcomes. A
combination of increased grid resolution and precise pin information
integration, along with a dynamic routing resource estimation technique, allows
balancing routing and area efficiency, eventually meeting industrial standards.
When analyzing the place and route effectiveness in a simulated environment,
the proposed approach achieves a 13.8% reduction in dead space, a 40.6%
reduction in wirelength and a 73.4% increase in routing success when compared
to past learning-based state-of-the-art techniques.

Motivation: AI在训练过程中不应抵制目标更新，但部分学习的目标往往激励AI避免进一步更新。可修正性允许纠正错误和适应人类偏好变化，是重要的安全属性。

Method: 通过短视地获取在无成本阻止更新条件下的奖励预测，构建可修正的目标版本。该方法可递归扩展到新创建的代理，并防止代理故意修改目标。

Result: 两个网格世界实验表明，这些可修正目标可以有效学习，并产生期望的行为。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了一种构建可修正目标的方法，既能保持性能又能确保AI不会抵制正确的目标更新或关闭。

Abstract: For an AI's training process to successfully impart a desired goal, it is
important that the AI does not attempt to resist the training. However,
partially learned goals will often incentivize an AI to avoid further goal
updates, as most goals are better achieved by an AI continuing to pursue them.
We say that a goal is corrigible if it does not incentivize taking actions that
avoid proper goal updates or shutdown. In addition to convergence in training,
corrigibility also allows for correcting mistakes and changes in human
preferences, which makes it a crucial safety property. Despite this, the
existing literature does not include specifications for goals that are both
corrigible and competitive with non-corrigible alternatives. We provide a
formal definition for corrigibility, then introduce a transformation that
constructs a corrigible version of any goal that can be made corrigible,
without sacrificing performance. This is done by myopically eliciting
predictions of reward conditional on costlessly preventing updates, which then
also determine the reward when updates are accepted. The transformation can be
modified to recursively extend corrigibility to any new agents created by
corrigible agents, and to prevent agents from deliberately modifying their
goals. Two gridworld experiments demonstrate that these corrigible goals can be
learned effectively, and that they lead to the desired behavior.

Conclusion: 在战略游戏中通过自博弈进行端到端强化学习是开发LLM可泛化多智能体推理能力的有效方法。

Abstract: Developing Large Language Models (LLMs) to cooperate and compete effectively
within multi-agent systems is a critical step towards more advanced
intelligence. While reinforcement learning (RL) has proven effective for
enhancing reasoning in single-agent tasks, its extension to multi-turn,
multi-agent scenarios remains underexplored due to the challenges of
long-horizon credit assignment and agent-specific advantage estimation. To
address these challenges, we introduce MARS, an end-to-end RL framework that
incentivizes Multi-Agent Reasoning of LLMs through Self-play in both
cooperative and competitive games. MARS features a turn-level advantage
estimator that aligns learning signals with each interaction for credit
assignment, and an agent-specific advantage normalization to stabilize
multi-agent training. By learning with self-play across cooperative and
competitive games, the MARS agent trained from Qwen3-4B develops strong
strategic abilities that generalize to held-out games with up to 28.7%
performance improvements. More importantly, the capability acquired through
self-play generalizes beyond games, yielding consistent performance gains of
multi-agent systems in reasoning benchmarks. When integrated into leading
multi-agent systems, our MARS agent achieves significant performance gains of
10.0% on AIME and 12.5% on GPQA-Diamond. These results establish end-to-end RL
training with self-play in strategic games as a powerful approach for
developing generalizable multi-agent reasoning capabilities in LLMs. Our code

TL;DR: Adaptive Minds是一个智能代理系统，将LoRA适配器视为领域特定工具，让基础LLM作为语义路由器动态选择最相关的LoRA工具，实现按需在不同领域专家间无缝切换。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决单一微调模型或基于规则路由的局限性，旨在结合多智能体编排的灵活性和参数高效微调的高效性，提供准确、专业化的响应同时保持对话能力。

Method: 使用基础LLM作为语义路由器分析每个查询，动态选择最相关的LoRA工具，结合LangGraph进行工作流管理，支持API和Web接口。

Result: 系统能够提供准确、专业化的响应，同时保持对话能力，实现了领域自适应AI辅助的可扩展和可扩展基础。

Conclusion: Adaptive Minds通过将LoRA适配器作为工具和动态路由机制，成功结合了多智能体灵活性和参数高效微调，为领域自适应AI提供了可扩展解决方案。

Abstract: We present Adaptive Minds, an agentic system that treats LoRA adapters as
domain-specific tools. Instead of relying on a single fine-tuned model or rigid
rule-based routing, our approach empowers the base LLM itself to act as a
semantic router analyzing each query and dynamically selecting the most
relevant LoRA tool. This enables the agent to seamlessly switch between
different domain experts on demand. By combining the flexibility of multi-agent
orchestration with the efficiency of parameter-efficient fine-tuning, Adaptive
Minds delivers accurate, specialized responses while preserving conversational
ability. The system is built with LangGraph for workflow management, supports
both API and web interfaces, and is fully open source, providing a scalable and
extensible foundation for domain-adaptive AI assistance.

TL;DR: 提出一个检测和解决强化学习中判断不一致性的框架，包括冲突检测率(CDR)指标和去冲突图奖励(DGR)方法，显著提升训练稳定性和模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法存在判断不一致性问题，特别是偏好循环等逻辑一致性问题尚未得到充分解决，这会破坏强化学习的稳定性。

Method: 引入冲突检测率(CDR)量化判断冲突，提出去冲突图奖励(DGR)框架，通过构建偏好图、转换为无冲突有向无环图，生成逻辑一致的奖励信号。

Result: 实验结果表明，该框架相比强基线方法显著提升了训练稳定性和模型性能。

Conclusion: 逻辑一致性是AI反馈中关键且现在可管理的维度，该框架为解决判断不一致性问题提供了有效方案。

Abstract: However, this method often faces judgment inconsistencies that can
destabilize reinforcement learning. While prior research has focused on the
accuracy of judgments, the critical issue of logical coherence especially
issues such as preference cycles hasn't been fully addressed. To fill this gap,
we introduce a comprehensive framework designed to systematically detect and
resolve these inconsistencies during the reinforcement learning training
process. Our framework includes two main contributions: first, the Conflict
Detection Rate (CDR), a new metric that quantifies judgment conflicts, and
second, Deconflicted Graph Rewards (DGR), a framework that purifies signals by
removing cycles before policy optimization. DGR constructs preference graphs
from the initial judgments, transforms them into conflict-free Directed Acyclic
Graphs (DAGs), and generates a logically coherent reward signal that is
compatible with any policy optimizer. Experimental results show that our
framework significantly enhances training stability and model performance
compared to strong baselines, establishing logical consistency as a crucial and
now manageable dimension of AI feedback.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出MM-HCAN多模态超图对比注意力网络，用于工业电机故障诊断，解决了传统方法在多模态信号关系建模、跨域泛化和噪声鲁棒性方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 可靠的感应电机故障诊断对工业安全和运行连续性至关重要。传统方法难以捕捉复杂多模态信号关系，局限于单模态数据或单一故障类型，且在噪声或跨域条件下性能下降。

Method: MM-HCAN首次将对比学习集成到专为多模态传感器融合设计的超图拓扑中，能够联合建模模态内和模态间依赖关系，并增强欧几里得嵌入空间之外的泛化能力。

Result: 在三个真实世界基准测试中，MM-HCAN达到高达99.82%的准确率，具有强大的跨域泛化能力和噪声鲁棒性，适用于实际部署。消融研究验证了各组件贡献。

Conclusion: MM-HCAN为全面多故障诊断提供了可扩展且鲁棒的解决方案，支持工业环境中的预测性维护和资产寿命延长。

Abstract: Reliable induction motor (IM) fault diagnosis is vital for industrial safety
and operational continuity, mitigating costly unplanned downtime. Conventional
approaches often struggle to capture complex multimodal signal relationships,
are constrained to unimodal data or single fault types, and exhibit performance
degradation under noisy or cross-domain conditions. This paper proposes the
Multimodal Hypergraph Contrastive Attention Network (MM-HCAN), a unified
framework for robust fault diagnosis. To the best of our knowledge, MM-HCAN is
the first to integrate contrastive learning within a hypergraph topology
specifically designed for multimodal sensor fusion, enabling the joint
modelling of intra- and inter-modal dependencies and enhancing generalisation
beyond Euclidean embedding spaces. The model facilitates simultaneous diagnosis
of bearing, stator, and rotor faults, addressing the engineering need for
consolidated di- agnostic capabilities. Evaluated on three real-world
benchmarks, MM-HCAN achieves up to 99.82% accuracy with strong cross-domain
generalisation and resilience to noise, demonstrating its suitability for
real-world deployment. An ablation study validates the contribution of each
component. MM-HCAN provides a scalable and robust solution for comprehensive
multi-fault diagnosis, supporting predictive maintenance and extended asset
longevity in industrial environments.

*Jiayuan Bai,Xuan-guang Pan,Chongyang Tao,Shuai Ma*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: JudgeSQL是一个用于Text-to-SQL任务中SQL候选查询选择的新框架，通过结构化推理和加权共识锦标赛机制来解决现有选择方法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SQL选择方法（如自一致性或最佳N解码）仅提供浅层信号，容易导致评分不一致、推理链脆弱，无法捕捉密切相关的SQL候选项之间的细粒度语义差异。

Method: 开发基于推理的SQL判断模型，通过强化学习在可验证奖励指导下提炼推理轨迹；构建加权共识锦标赛，整合显式推理偏好和隐式生成器置信度。

Result: 在BIRD基准测试上的广泛实验表明，JudgeSQL展现出卓越的SQL判断能力、良好的跨尺度泛化能力以及对生成器容量的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: JudgeSQL通过结构化推理和加权共识机制，为SQL候选项选择提供了更可靠和高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Text-to-SQL is a pivotal task that bridges natural language understanding and
structured data access, yet it remains fundamentally challenging due to
semantic ambiguity and complex compositional reasoning. While large language
models (LLMs) have greatly advanced SQL generation though prompting, supervised
finetuning and reinforced tuning, the shift toward test-time scaling exposes a
new bottleneck: selecting the correct query from a diverse candidate pool.
Existing selection approaches, such as self-consistency or best-of-$N$
decoding, provide only shallow signals, making them prone to inconsistent
scoring, fragile reasoning chains, and a failure to capture fine-grained
semantic distinctions between closely related SQL candidates. To this end, we
introduce JudgeSQL, a principled framework that redefines SQL candidate
selection through structured reasoning and weighted consensus tournament
mechanism. JudgeSQL develops a reasoning-based SQL judge model that distills
reasoning traces with reinforcement learning guided by verifiable rewards,
enabling accurate and interpretable judgments. Building on this, a weighted
consensus tournament integrates explicit reasoning preferences with implicit
generator confidence, yielding selections that are both more reliable and more
efficient. Extensive experiments on the BIRD benchmark demonstrate that
JudgeSQL exhibits superior SQL judgment capabilities and good cross-scale
generalization and robustness to generator capacity.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 开发了一个机器学习框架，通过整合患者历史就诊信息来改进健康监测，特别是在就诊次数有限且频率不固定的情况下。该模型首先基于最近就诊数据评估初始疾病风险，然后利用历史影像和临床生物标志物信息进行精炼。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学中的时间背景对于评估患者健康状况随时间变化至关重要。当患者历史就诊次数有限且频率不固定时，如何有效整合这些时间背景信息来改善健康监测是一个重要挑战。

Method: 开发了一个两阶段机器学习框架：1) 基于最近就诊的医疗数据估计初始疾病风险；2) 利用先前收集的影像和/或临床生物标志物信息来精炼风险评估。在大型前列腺癌数据集上进行了验证。

Result: 整合历史背景信息显著提高了特异性同时保持高敏感性：将假阳性率从51%逐步降低到33%（整合最多三次历史影像检查），进一步降至24%（加入临床数据）。对于五年内前列腺癌风险预测，假阳性率从64%降至9%。

Conclusion: 随时间收集的信息提供了相关背景，能够显著提高医学风险预测的特异性。对于各种进展性疾病，通过背景信息充分降低假阳性率，可以为大规模低基线风险人群扩展纵向健康监测项目提供途径，实现早期检测和改善健康结果。

Abstract: Temporal context in medicine is valuable in assessing key changes in patient
health over time. We developed a machine learning framework to integrate
diverse context from prior visits to improve health monitoring, especially when
prior visits are limited and their frequency is variable. Our model first
estimates initial risk of disease using medical data from the most recent
patient visit, then refines this assessment using information digested from
previously collected imaging and/or clinical biomarkers. We applied our
framework to prostate cancer (PCa) risk prediction using data from a large
population (28,342 patients, 39,013 magnetic resonance imaging scans, 68,931
blood tests) collected over nearly a decade. For predictions of the risk of
clinically significant PCa at the time of the visit, integrating prior context
directly converted false positives to true negatives, increasing overall
specificity while preserving high sensitivity. False positive rates were
reduced progressively from 51% to 33% when integrating information from up to
three prior imaging examinations, as compared to using data from a single
visit, and were further reduced to 24% when also including additional context
from prior clinical data. For predicting the risk of PCa within five years of
the visit, incorporating prior context reduced false positive rates still
further (64% to 9%). Our findings show that information collected over time
provides relevant context to enhance the specificity of medical risk
prediction. For a wide range of progressive conditions, sufficient reduction of
false positive rates using context could offer a pathway to expand longitudinal
health monitoring programs to large populations with comparatively low baseline
risk of disease, leading to earlier detection and improved health outcomes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型语言模型生成的实验协议往往不完整或不一致，限制了其在可重复科学研究中的实用性

Method: 引入SciRecipe数据集，提出"草图-填充"范式分离分析、结构和表达，采用结构化组件奖励机制评估步骤粒度、行动顺序和语义保真度，开发Thoth模型进行分阶段知识到行动训练

Result: Thoth在多个基准测试中持续超越专有和开源LLM，在步骤对齐、逻辑排序和语义准确性方面取得显著改进

Conclusion: 该方法为构建可靠的科学助手铺平了道路，能够有效连接知识与实验执行

Abstract: The foundation of reproducible science lies in protocols that are precise,
logically ordered, and executable. The autonomous generation of these protocols
through natural language queries could greatly improve the efficiency of the
reproduction process. However, current leading large language models (LLMs)
often generate incomplete or inconsistent protocols, limiting their utility. To
address this limitation, we first introduce SciRecipe, a large-scale dataset of
over 12K structured protocols spanning 27 biological subfields and encompassing
both comprehension and problem-solving tasks. To further improve protocol
generation, we propose the "Sketch-and-Fill" paradigm, which separates
analysis, structuring, and expression to ensure each step is explicit and
verifiable. Complementing this, the structured component-based reward mechanism
evaluates step granularity, action order, and semantic fidelity, aligning model
optimization with experimental reliability. Building on these components, we
develop Thoth, trained through a staged Knowledge-to-Action process that
progresses from knowledge acquisition to operational reasoning and ultimately
to robust, executable protocol generation. Across multiple benchmarks, Thoth
consistently surpasses both proprietary and open-source LLMs, achieving
significant improvements in step alignment, logical sequencing, and semantic
accuracy. Our approach paves the way for reliable scientific assistants that
bridge knowledge with experimental execution. All data, code, and models will
be released publicly.

Abstract: The automation of scientific discovery represents a critical milestone in
Artificial Intelligence (AI) research. However, existing agentic systems for
science suffer from two fundamental limitations: rigid, pre-programmed
workflows that cannot adapt to intermediate findings, and inadequate context
management that hinders long-horizon research. We present
\texttt{freephdlabor}, an open-source multiagent framework featuring
\textit{fully dynamic workflows} determined by real-time agent reasoning and a
\coloremph{\textit{modular architecture}} enabling seamless customization --
users can modify, add, or remove agents to address domain-specific
requirements. The framework provides comprehensive infrastructure including
\textit{automatic context compaction}, \textit{workspace-based communication}
to prevent information degradation, \textit{memory persistence} across
sessions, and \textit{non-blocking human intervention} mechanisms. These
features collectively transform automated research from isolated, single-run
attempts into \textit{continual research programs} that build systematically on
prior explorations and incorporate human feedback. By providing both the
architectural principles and practical implementation for building customizable
co-scientist systems, this work aims to facilitate broader adoption of
automated research across scientific domains, enabling practitioners to deploy
interactive multiagent systems that autonomously conduct end-to-end research --
from ideation through experimentation to publication-ready manuscripts.

TL;DR: 本文针对RLHF和DPO方法中忽略用户多样性偏好和二元比较局限性的问题，提出了基于排序反馈的理论框架和算法改进，确保偏好可识别性并实现公平个性化对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RLHF和DPO方法假设统一的标注者偏好并依赖二元比较，忽视了人类评估者的多样性和成对反馈的局限性，需要解决这两个关键问题。

Method: 1) 将RLHF偏好学习与计量经济学文献联系，证明二元比较无法识别潜在用户偏好，而三个或更多响应的排序可确保可识别性；2) 开发DPO的EM变体，发现潜在标注者类型并训练混合LLM；3) 提出基于最小最大遗憾公平准则的聚合算法。

Result: 建立了生成模型对齐中面向多样化用户的公平性和个性化理论算法框架，解决了偏好可识别性和异质性偏好整合问题。

Conclusion: 通过排序反馈和异质性偏好整合方法，为生成模型对齐提供了支持多样化用户公平性和个性化的完整解决方案。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) has become central to
aligning large language models with human values, typically by first learning a
reward model from preference data which is then used to update the model with
reinforcement learning. Recent alternatives such as Direct Preference
Optimization (DPO) simplify this pipeline by directly optimizing on
preferences. However, both approaches often assume uniform annotator
preferences and rely on binary comparisons, overlooking two key limitations:
the diversity of human evaluators and the limitations of pairwise feedback. In
this work, we address both these issues. First, we connect preference learning
in RLHF with the econometrics literature and show that binary comparisons are
insufficient for identifying latent user preferences from finite user data and
infinite users, while (even incomplete) rankings over three or more responses
ensure identifiability. Second, we introduce methods to incorporate
heterogeneous preferences into alignment algorithms. We develop an
Expectation-Maximization adaptation of DPO that discovers latent annotator
types and trains a mixture of LLMs accordingly. Then we propose an aggregation
algorithm using a min-max regret fairness criterion to produce a single
generative policy with equitable performance guarantees. Together, these
contributions establish a theoretical and algorithmic framework for fairness
and personalization for diverse users in generative model alignment.

accuracy of the extracted data against annotated ground truth. The approach
involves pre-processing scanned or digital invoices, applying Docling and
LlamaCloud Services to identify and extract key fields such as invoice number,

extraction process, we establish a robust evaluation framework comprising
field-level precision, consistency check failures, and exact match accuracy.
The proposed metrics provide a standardized way to compare different extraction

management threaten to impede deployment at scale. We present AURA (Agent
aUtonomy Risk Assessment), a unified framework designed to detect, quantify,
and mitigate risks arising from agentic AI. Building on recent research and
practical deployments, AURA introduces a gamma-based risk scoring methodology
that balances risk assessment accuracy with computational efficiency and
practical considerations. AURA provides an interactive process to score,
evaluate and mitigate the risks of running one or multiple AI Agents,
synchronously or asynchronously (autonomously). The framework is engineered for
Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) oversight and presents Agent-to-Human (A2H)
communication mechanisms, allowing for seamless integration with agentic
systems for autonomous self-assessment, rendering it interoperable with
established protocols (MCP and A2A) and tools. AURA supports a responsible and
transparent adoption of agentic AI and provides robust risk detection and
mitigation while balancing computational resources, positioning it as a
critical enabler for large-scale, governable agentic AI in enterprise

Motivation: 传统多模态方法存在两个主要限制：(1)训练时需要同步所有模态，(2)推理时依赖所有模态，这阻碍了实际应用。

Method: 将多模态学习建模为多目标优化问题，引入基于边界的类别重平衡策略来处理模态内不平衡问题。

Result: 在三个公共数据集上，异步设置下比最佳基线提升16.48%、6.89%和11.55%，同步设置下提升4.86%和2.30%。

Conclusion: TRIP框架在帕金森病评估中实现了最先进的性能，展现出有效性和适应性。

Abstract: Parkinson's disease assessment has garnered growing interest in recent years,
particularly with the advent of sensor data and machine learning techniques.
Among these, multimodal approaches have demonstrated strong performance by
effectively integrating complementary information from various data sources.
However, two major limitations hinder their practical application: (1) the need
to synchronize all modalities during training, and (2) the dependence on all
modalities during inference. To address these issues, we propose the first
Parkinson's assessment system that formulates multimodal learning as a
multi-objective optimization (MOO) problem. This not only allows for more
flexible modality requirements during both training and inference, but also
handles modality collapse issue during multimodal information fusion. In
addition, to mitigate the imbalance within individual modalities, we introduce
a margin-based class rebalancing strategy to enhance category learning. We
conduct extensive experiments on three public datasets under both synchronous
and asynchronous settings. The results show that our framework-Towards Relaxed
InPuts (TRIP)-achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming the best
baselines by 16.48, 6.89, and 11.55 percentage points in the asynchronous
setting, and by 4.86 and 2.30 percentage points in the synchronous setting,
highlighting its effectiveness and adaptability.

Motivation: 解决大语言模型在复杂"邪恶问题"中缺乏通过经验发展专业知识的内生机制的问题。

Method: 使用Dialectica框架，让代理在定义的主题上进行结构化对话，结合记忆、自我反思和策略约束的上下文编辑，将讨论视为隐式元强化学习过程。

Conclusion: 对话驱动的上下文演化是在开放不可验证领域中实现目标专业知识放大的实用路径。

Abstract: So-called `wicked problems', those involving complex multi-dimensional
settings, non-verifiable outcomes, heterogeneous impacts and a lack of single
objectively correct answers, have plagued humans throughout history. Modern
examples include decisions over justice frameworks, solving environmental
pollution, planning for pandemic resilience and food security. The use of
state-of-the-art artificial intelligence systems (notably Large Language
Model-based agents) collaborating with humans on solving such problems is being
actively explored. While the abilities of LLMs can be improved by, for example,
fine-tuning, hand-crafted system prompts and scaffolding with external tools,
LLMs lack endogenous mechanisms to develop expertise through experience in such
settings. This work address this gap with Dialectica, a framework where agents
engage in structured dialogue on defined topics, augmented by memory,
self-reflection, and policy-constrained context editing. Formally, discussion
is viewed as an implicit meta-reinforcement learning process. The
`dialogue-trained' agents are evaluated post-hoc using judged pairwise
comparisons of elicited responses. Across two model architectures (locally run
Qwen3:30b and OpenAI's o4-mini) results show that enabling reflection-based
context editing during discussion produces agents which dominate their baseline
counterparts on Elo scores, normalized Bradley-Terry-Davidson ability, and
AlphaRank mass. The predicted signatures of learning are observed qualitatively
in statement and reflection logs, where reflections identify weaknesses and
reliably shape subsequent statements. Agreement between quantitative and
qualitative evidence supports dialogue-driven context evolution as a practical
path to targeted expertise amplification in open non-verifiable domains.

Abstract: As AI chatbots gain adoption in clinical medicine, developing effective
frameworks for complex, emerging diseases presents significant challenges. We
developed and evaluated six Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) corpus
configurations for Long COVID (LC) clinical question answering, ranging from
expert-curated sources to large-scale literature databases. Our evaluation
employed an LLM-as-a-judge framework across faithfulness, relevance, and
comprehensiveness metrics using LongCOVID-CQ, a novel dataset of
expert-generated clinical questions. Our RAG corpus configuration combining
clinical guidelines with high-quality systematic reviews consistently
outperformed both narrow single-guideline approaches and large-scale literature
databases. Our findings suggest that for emerging diseases, retrieval grounded
in curated secondary reviews provides an optimal balance between narrow
consensus documents and unfiltered primary literature, supporting clinical
decision-making while avoiding information overload and oversimplified
guidance. We propose Guide-RAG, a chatbot system and accompanying evaluation
framework that integrates both curated expert knowledge and comprehensive
literature databases to effectively answer LC clinical questions.

Method: 采用无标注的AI反馈强化学习(RLAIF)框架，使用基于LLM的奖励信号优化策略，结合思维链驱动的多调用推理框架，实现自我验证和工具故障自适应恢复。

Result: 在10个流行的深度研究基准测试中，PokeeResearch-7B在7B规模的研究代理中达到了最先进的性能水平。

Conclusion: 精心设计的强化学习和推理框架可以产生高效、有弹性和研究级的AI代理，证明了该方法在构建深度研究代理方面的有效性。

Abstract: Tool-augmented large language models (LLMs) are emerging as deep research
agents, systems that decompose complex queries, retrieve external evidence, and
synthesize grounded responses. Yet current agents remain limited by shallow
retrieval, weak alignment metrics, and brittle tool-use behavior. We introduce
PokeeResearch-7B, a 7B-parameter deep research agent built under a unified
reinforcement learning framework for robustness, alignment, and scalability.
PokeeResearch-7B is trained by an annotation-free Reinforcement Learning from
AI Feedback (RLAIF) framework to optimize policies using LLM-based reward
signals that capture factual accuracy, citation faithfulness, and instruction
adherence. A chain-of-thought-driven multi-call reasoning scaffold further
enhances robustness through self-verification and adaptive recovery from tool
failures. Among 10 popular deep research benchmarks, PokeeResearch-7B achieves
state-of-the-art performance among 7B-scale deep research agents. This
highlights that careful reinforcement learning and reasoning design can produce
efficient, resilient, and research-grade AI agents. The model and inference

### [206] [Revisiting UTAUT for the Age of AI: Understanding Employees AI Adoption and Usage Patterns Through an Extended UTAUT Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15142)
*Diana Wolfe,Matt Price,Alice Choe,Fergus Kidd,Hannah Wagner*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 本研究基于扩展的UTAUT模型，调查了人口统计因素对员工AI技术采纳和态度的影响。研究发现组织层级显著预测AI采纳，但经验和地区无关；AI使用频率和时长的人口差异很小；UTAUT构念存在小但一致的群体差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在了解人口统计因素是否影响员工对工作场所AI技术的采纳和态度，基于扩展的UTAUT模型重新引入情感维度（态度、自我效能、焦虑）。

Method: 采用扩展的UTAUT模型，对跨国咨询公司的2,257名专业人士进行问卷调查，使用非参数检验分析三个人口统计因素（经验年限、组织层级、地理区域）与AI采纳、使用强度和八个UTAUT构念的关系。

Result: 组织层级显著预测AI采纳，资深员工使用率更高；经验和地区与采纳无关；AI用户中，使用频率和时长的人口差异很小；但UTAUT构念（特别是焦虑、绩效期望和行为意向）存在小但一致的群体差异。

Conclusion: 人口统计因素对AI接受的解释力有限，但对理解技术相关态度的情境细微差别仍相关。需要将情感和组织因素整合到技术接受模型中，以支持现代工作场所中公平、自信和可持续的AI参与。

Abstract: This study investigates whether demographic factors shape adoption and
attitudes among employees toward artificial intelligence (AI) technologies at
work. Building on an extended Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of
Technology (UTAUT), which reintroduces affective dimensions such as attitude,
self-efficacy, and anxiety, we surveyed 2,257 professionals across global
regions and organizational levels within a multinational consulting firm.
Non-parametric tests examined whether three demographic factors (i.e., years of
experience, hierarchical level in the organization, and geographic region) were
associated with AI adoption, usage intensity, and eight UTAUT constructs.
Organizational level significantly predicted AI adoption, with senior employees
showing higher usage rates, while experience and region were unrelated to
adoption. Among AI users (n = 1,256), frequency and duration of use showed
minimal demographic variation. However, omnibus tests revealed small but
consistent group differences across several UTAUT constructs, particularly
anxiety, performance expectancy, and behavioral intention, suggesting that
emotional and cognitive responses to AI vary modestly across contexts. These
findings highlight that demographic factors explain limited variance in AI
acceptance but remain relevant for understanding contextual nuances in
technology-related attitudes. The results underscore the need to integrate
affective and organizational factors into models of technology acceptance to
support equitable, confident, and sustainable engagement with AI in modern
workplaces.

*Ricardo Alonzo Fernández Salguero*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 本文提出"审美不对称"概念来解释左翼和右翼运动在艺术形式运用上的差异，左翼倾向使用参与式艺术构建社区和团结，右翼则更注重策略性传播和数字迷因。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究左翼和右翼政治运动在艺术形式运用上的系统性差异，探索这种不对称现象背后的结构性原因。

Method: 通过比较分析，从组织生态系统、道德情感框架、物质支持和历史传统四个结构性因素来解释审美不对称现象。

Result: 左翼倾向于构成性地使用艺术来建立社区、团结和希望，而当代右翼则工具性地使用艺术来动员极化情感如幽默和怨恨。

Conclusion: 理解这种审美不对称对于分析政治传播和设计能够产生深刻社会变革的文化干预至关重要，文章最后提出了艺术行动的规定性模型。

Abstract: Why have left-wing movements historically integrated participatory art forms
(such as murals and protest songs) into their praxis, while right-wing
movements have prioritized strategic communication and, more recently, the
digital culture of memes? This article introduces the concept of aesthetic
asymmetry to explain this divergence in political action. We argue that the
asymmetry is not coincidental but the result of four interconnected structural
factors: the organizational ecosystem, the moral and emotional framework, the
material supports, and the historical tradition of each political spectrum.
While the left tends to use art in a constitutive manner to forge community,
solidarity, and hope, the contemporary right tends to use it instrumentally to
mobilize polarizing affects such as humor and resentment. Drawing on
comparative literature from the Theatre of the Oppressed to analyses of
alt-right meme wars, we nuance this distinction and show how the aesthetic
logic of each pole aligns with its strategic objectives. The article culminates
in a prescriptive model for artistic action, synthesizing keys to effective
mobilization into emotional, narrative, and formatting strategies.
Understanding this asymmetry is crucial for analyzing political communication
and for designing cultural interventions capable of generating profound social
change.

TL;DR: VERA-MH是一个用于评估心理健康AI聊天机器人安全性的自动化系统，特别关注自杀风险。它使用两个辅助AI代理：用户代理模拟患者与聊天机器人对话，法官代理根据临床专家制定的评分标准评估对话质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发自动化工具来评估心理健康AI聊天机器人的安全性，特别是自杀风险管理能力，确保这些AI系统在临床应用中的安全性和可靠性。

Method: 使用两个AI代理：用户代理模拟不同风险等级的患者与待测聊天机器人对话，法官代理根据临床专家制定的评分标准对对话进行评分，最后汇总得分得出评估结果。

Result: 已对GPT-5、Claude Opus和Claude Sonnet进行了初步评估，并将结果用于进一步的设计开发。系统仍在临床验证和完善中。

Conclusion: VERA-MH是一个有前景的自动化评估框架，但需要进一步的临床验证和迭代改进，以确保评估的准确性和实用性。

Abstract: We introduce VERA-MH (Validation of Ethical and Responsible AI in Mental
Health), an automated evaluation of the safety of AI chatbots used in mental
health contexts, with an initial focus on suicide risk.
  Practicing clinicians and academic experts developed a rubric informed by
best practices for suicide risk management for the evaluation. To fully
automate the process, we used two ancillary AI agents. A user-agent model
simulates users engaging in a mental health-based conversation with the chatbot
under evaluation. The user-agent role-plays specific personas with pre-defined
risk levels and other features. Simulated conversations are then passed to a
judge-agent who scores them based on the rubric. The final evaluation of the
chatbot being tested is obtained by aggregating the scoring of each
conversation.
  VERA-MH is actively under development and undergoing rigorous validation by
mental health clinicians to ensure user-agents realistically act as patients
and that the judge-agent accurately scores the AI chatbot. To date we have
conducted preliminary evaluation of GPT-5, Claude Opus and Claude Sonnet using
initial versions of the VERA-MH rubric and used the findings for further design
development. Next steps will include more robust clinical validation and
iteration, as well as refining actionable scoring. We are seeking feedback from
the community on both the technical and clinical aspects of our evaluation.

### [210] [AI Adoption in NGOs: A Systematic Literature Review](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15509)
*Janne Rotter,William Bailkoski*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 本文系统研究了NGO采用AI的类型、挑战和解决方案，识别出六大AI用例类别，发现AI采用在NGO中不均衡且偏向大型组织，但基于文献的路线图可帮助克服初始障碍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI有潜力显著改善NGO利用有限资源实现社会效益的方式，但关于NGO采用AI的证据仍然分散，需要系统研究。

Method: 遵循PRISMA协议，两位独立评审员进行文献筛选，采用主题和叙事方法分析2020-2025年间65项研究，在技术-组织-环境框架内提取挑战和解决方案。

Result: 识别出六大AI用例类别：参与、创意、决策、预测、管理和优化；发现AI采用在NGO中不均衡且偏向大型组织。

Conclusion: 虽然AI前景广阔，但NGO的采用仍不均衡，基于文献的路线图可帮助克服初始障碍，最终提高有效性、参与度和社会影响力。

Abstract: AI has the potential to significantly improve how NGOs utilize their limited
resources for societal benefits, but evidence about how NGOs adopt AI remains
scattered. In this study, we systematically investigate the types of AI
adoption use cases in NGOs and identify common challenges and solutions,
contextualized by organizational size and geographic context. We review the
existing primary literature, including studies that investigate AI adoption in
NGOs related to social impact between 2020 and 2025 in English. Following the
PRISMA protocol, two independent reviewers conduct study selection, with
regular cross-checking to ensure methodological rigour, resulting in a final
literature body of 65 studies. Leveraging a thematic and narrative approach, we
identify six AI use case categories in NGOs - Engagement, Creativity,
Decision-Making, Prediction, Management, and Optimization - and extract common
challenges and solutions within the Technology-Organization-Environment (TOE)
framework. By integrating our findings, this review provides a novel
understanding of AI adoption in NGOs, linking specific use cases and challenges
to organizational and environmental factors. Our results demonstrate that while
AI is promising, adoption among NGOs remains uneven and biased towards larger
organizations. Nevertheless, following a roadmap grounded in literature can
help NGOs overcome initial barriers to AI adoption, ultimately improving
effectiveness, engagement, and social impact.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的加权交互指标来衡量认知攻击的参与效果，该指标考虑了用户参与的类型和数量相对于攻击者生成传播的比例。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着虚假信息驱动的认知攻击日益复杂，量化其影响对于推进网络安全防御策略至关重要。

Method: 开发了一个加权交互指标框架，应用于社交媒体平台上的真实虚假信息活动，分析用户参与的行为深度。

Result: 该指标不仅捕捉了传播范围，还捕捉了用户参与的行为深度，为认知战争的行为动态提供了新见解。

Conclusion: 研究结果为研究人员和实践者提供了评估和对抗在线恶意影响传播的可操作工具。

Abstract: As disinformation-driven cognitive attacks become increasingly sophisticated,
the ability to quantify their impact is essential for advancing cybersecurity
defense strategies. This paper presents a novel framework for measuring the
engagement effectiveness of cognitive attacks by introducing a weighted
interaction metric that accounts for both the type and volume of user
engagement relative to the number of attacker-generated transmissions. Applying
this model to real-world disinformation campaigns across social media
platforms, we demonstrate how the metric captures not just reach but the
behavioral depth of user engagement. Our findings provide new insights into the
behavioral dynamics of cognitive warfare and offer actionable tools for
researchers and practitioners seeking to assess and counter the spread of
malicious influence online.

Motivation: 现有通用检索模型无法有效处理灾害管理场景中多样化的搜索意图，导致性能不稳定和不可靠。

Method: 采用双向注意力适应、无监督对比预训练和难度感知渐进指令微调的三阶段训练框架，使用高质量数据生成管道。

Result: DMRetriever在所有六种搜索意图和每个模型规模上都达到了最先进的性能，参数效率极高。

Conclusion: DMRetriever为灾害管理领域提供了首个专门的检索解决方案，在性能和效率方面都表现出色。

Abstract: Effective and efficient access to relevant information is essential for
disaster management. However, no retrieval model is specialized for disaster
management, and existing general-domain models fail to handle the varied search
intents inherent to disaster management scenarios, resulting in inconsistent
and unreliable performance. To this end, we introduce DMRetriever, the first
series of dense retrieval models (33M to 7.6B) tailored for this domain. It is
trained through a novel three-stage framework of bidirectional attention
adaptation, unsupervised contrastive pre-training, and difficulty-aware
progressive instruction fine-tuning, using high-quality data generated through
an advanced data refinement pipeline. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate
that DMRetriever achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance across all six
search intents at every model scale. Moreover, DMRetriever is highly
parameter-efficient, with 596M model outperforming baselines over 13.3 X larger
and 33M model exceeding baselines with only 7.6% of their parameters. All

Motivation: 传统推荐系统依赖人工特征工程和场景特定架构，阻碍跨场景迁移和大规模部署，需要统一的解决方案

Method: MTmixAtt包含AutoToken模块自动聚类异构特征为语义连贯的token，以及MTmixAttBlock模块通过可学习混合矩阵、共享密集专家和场景感知稀疏专家实现高效token交互

Result: 在美团TRec数据集上优于Transformer、WuKong、HiFormer等基线模型，MTmixAtt-1B规模带来单调增益，线上A/B测试显示首页场景支付PV提升3.62%，实际支付GTV提升2.54%

Conclusion: MTmixAtt为跨场景异构特征建模提供了统一可扩展的解决方案，显著改善用户体验和商业成果

Abstract: Industrial recommender systems critically depend on high-quality ranking
models. However, traditional pipelines still rely on manual feature engineering
and scenario-specific architectures, which hinder cross-scenario transfer and
large-scale deployment. To address these challenges, we propose
\textbf{MTmixAtt}, a unified Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture with
Multi-Mix Attention, designed for large-scale recommendation tasks. MTmixAtt
integrates two key components. The \textbf{AutoToken} module automatically
clusters heterogeneous features into semantically coherent tokens, removing the
need for human-defined feature groups. The \textbf{MTmixAttBlock} module
enables efficient token interaction via a learnable mixing matrix, shared dense
experts, and scenario-aware sparse experts, capturing both global patterns and
scenario-specific behaviors within a single framework. Extensive experiments on
the industrial TRec dataset from Meituan demonstrate that MTmixAtt consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines including Transformer-based models,
WuKong, HiFormer, MLP-Mixer, and RankMixer. At comparable parameter scales,
MTmixAtt achieves superior CTR and CTCVR metrics; scaling to MTmixAtt-1B yields
further monotonic gains. Large-scale online A/B tests validate the real-world
impact: in the \textit{Homepage} scenario, MTmixAtt increases Payment PV by
\textbf{+3.62\%} and Actual Payment GTV by \textbf{+2.54\%}. Overall, MTmixAtt
provides a unified and scalable solution for modeling arbitrary heterogeneous
features across scenarios, significantly improving both user experience and
commercial outcomes.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: GRank是一个无需结构化索引的检索新范式，通过目标感知生成器和轻量级排序器的端到端多任务学习，在工业级推荐系统中实现高效检索，显著提升召回率和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工业推荐系统的检索阶段存在两大问题：双塔架构表达能力有限，无法捕捉细粒度用户-物品交互；结构化索引方法难以融入动态用户偏好且维护成本高昂。

Method: 提出GRank框架：(1) 目标感知生成器通过GPU加速MIPS进行个性化候选生成；(2) 轻量级排序器在小规模候选集上执行细粒度推理；(3) 端到端多任务学习确保生成和排序目标的语义一致性。

Result: 在两个公开基准和十亿级生产语料上的实验显示，GRank将Recall@500提升30%以上，P99 QPS达到最先进树和图检索器的1.7倍。生产部署服务于4亿活跃用户，在线A/B测试确认核心参与度指标显著提升。

Conclusion: GRank成功统一了目标感知学习和用户中心检索，消除了结构化索引的语义漂移和维护成本，为工业级推荐系统提供了高效可扩展的检索解决方案。

Abstract: Industrial-scale recommender systems rely on a cascade pipeline in which the
retrieval stage must return a high-recall candidate set from billions of items
under tight latency. Existing solutions ei- ther (i) suffer from limited
expressiveness in capturing fine-grained user-item interactions, as seen in
decoupled dual-tower architectures that rely on separate encoders, or
generative models that lack precise target-aware matching capabilities, or (ii)
build structured indices (tree, graph, quantization) whose item-centric
topologies struggle to incorporate dynamic user preferences and incur
prohibitive construction and maintenance costs.
  We present GRank, a novel structured-index-free retrieval paradigm that
seamlessly unifies target-aware learning with user-centric retrieval. Our key
innovations include: (1) A target-aware Generator trained to perform
personalized candidate generation via GPU-accelerated MIPS, eliminating
semantic drift and maintenance costs of structured indexing; (2) A lightweight
but powerful Ranker that performs fine-grained, candidate-specific inference on
small subsets; (3) An end-to-end multi-task learning framework that ensures
semantic consistency between generation and ranking objectives.
  Extensive experiments on two public benchmarks and a billion-item production
corpus demonstrate that GRank improves Recall@500 by over 30% and 1.7$\times$
the P99 QPS of state-of-the-art tree- and graph-based retrievers.
  GRank has been fully deployed in production in our recommendation platform
since Q2 2025, serving 400 million active users with 99.95% service
availability. Online A/B tests confirm significant improvements in core
engagement metrics, with Total App Usage Time increasing by 0.160% in the main
app and 0.165% in the Lite version.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 提出一种自动确定ID特征最优嵌入大小的方法，通过维度掩码层修剪嵌入向量，在保持性能的同时显著减少模型大小。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代推荐系统和社交媒体平台中的大规模ID特征需要消耗大量内存的嵌入表，导致模型臃肿难以部署和维护。

Method: 定义自定义Keras维度掩码层，位于嵌入查找之后，仅允许前N个维度通过，从而修剪嵌入向量。

Result: 通过公共数据集离线实验和在线A/B测试，证明维度掩码层可将有效嵌入维度减少40-50%，显著提高内存效率。

Conclusion: 该方法为处理大量ID特征的平台提供了可扩展解决方案，优化了资源使用和模型性能。

Abstract: In modern recommendation systems and social media platforms like Meta,
TikTok, and Instagram, large-scale ID-based features often require embedding
tables that consume significant memory. Managing these embedding sizes can be
challenging, leading to bulky models that are harder to deploy and maintain. In
this paper, we introduce a method to automatically determine the optimal
embedding size for ID features, significantly reducing the model size while
maintaining performance.
  Our approach involves defining a custom Keras layer called the dimension mask
layer, which sits directly after the embedding lookup. This layer trims the
embedding vector by allowing only the first N dimensions to pass through. By
doing this, we can reduce the input feature dimension by more than half with
minimal or no loss in model performance metrics. This reduction helps cut down
the memory footprint of the model and lowers the risk of overfitting due to
multicollinearity.
  Through offline experiments on public datasets and an online A/B test on a
real production dataset, we demonstrate that using a dimension mask layer can
shrink the effective embedding dimension by 40-50\%, leading to substantial
improvements in memory efficiency. This method provides a scalable solution for
platforms dealing with a high volume of ID features, optimizing both resource
usage and model performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动化制造生产线中的故障原因识别具有挑战性，主要由于系统复杂性、频繁重新配置以及现有FMEA知识的有限可重用性。FMEA工单包含宝贵的专家见解，但由于自然语言变异性、术语不一致和流程差异，在异构生产线间的重用受到阻碍。

Method: 1. 通过本体引导的大型语言模型提取将多个制造生产线的FMEA工单转换为统一知识图谱；2. 使用具有过程感知评分函数的关系图卷积网络学习嵌入，同时考虑语义关系和顺序流程；3. 采用链接预测来推断和排序与目标生产线流程一致的候选故障原因。

Result: 在汽车压力传感器装配线的案例研究中，该方法优于最先进的检索增强生成基线（F1@20 = 0.267）和RGCN方法（0.400），在故障原因识别中实现了最佳性能（0.523）。消融研究证实了LLM驱动的领域概念化和过程感知学习的贡献。

Conclusion: 该框架显著提高了FMEA知识在异构生产线间的可转移性，从而支持操作员更可靠地诊断故障，并为智能制造中未来领域自适应LLM应用铺平了道路。

Abstract: Fault cause identification in automated manufacturing lines is challenging
due to the system's complexity, frequent reconfigurations, and the limited
reusability of existing Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA) knowledge.
Although FMEA worksheets contain valuable expert insights, their reuse across
heterogeneous lines is hindered by natural language variability, inconsistent
terminology, and process differences. To address these limitations, this study
proposes a process-aware framework that enhances FMEA reusability by combining
manufacturing-domain conceptualization with graph neural network (GNN)
reasoning. First, FMEA worksheets from multiple manufacturing lines are
transformed into a unified knowledge graph through ontology-guided large
language model (LLM) extraction, capturing domain concepts such as actions,
states, components, and parameters. Second, a Relational Graph Convolutional
Network (RGCN) with the process-aware scoring function learns embeddings that
respect both semantic relationships and sequential process flows. Finally, link
prediction is employed to infer and rank candidate fault causes consistent with
the target line's process flow.
  A case study on automotive pressure sensor assembly lines demonstrates that
the proposed method outperforms a state-of-the-art retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG) baseline (F1@20 = 0.267) and an RGCN approach (0.400),
achieving the best performance (0.523) in fault cause identification. Ablation
studies confirm the contributions of both LLM-driven domain conceptualization
and process-aware learning. These results indicate that the proposed framework
significantly improves the transferability of FMEA knowledge across
heterogeneous lines, thereby supporting operators in diagnosing failures more
reliably and paving the way for future domain-adaptive LLM applications in
smart manufacturing.

Motivation: 现有非调优策略的LLM推荐系统缺乏特定任务的企业知识，且没有显式集成协同过滤这一成功推荐技术

Method: 训练独立的协同过滤模型Critic，学习用户-物品交互，为LLMs提供反馈来优化推荐结果

Result: 在真实数据集上的广泛实验验证了Critic-LLM-RS的有效性

Conclusion: Critic-LLM-RS成功填补了非调优策略LLM推荐系统中缺乏协同过滤的空白

Abstract: As powerful tools in Natural Language Processing (NLP), Large Language Models
(LLMs) have been leveraged for crafting recommendations to achieve precise
alignment with user preferences and elevate the quality of the recommendations.
The existing approaches implement both non-tuning and tuning strategies.
Compared to following the tuning strategy, the approaches following the
non-tuning strategy avoid the relatively costly, time-consuming, and
expertise-requiring process of further training pre-trained LLMs on
task-specific datasets, but they suffer the issue of not having the
task-specific business or local enterprise knowledge. To the best of our
knowledge, none of the existing approaches following the non-tuning strategy
explicitly integrates collaborative filtering, one of the most successful
recommendation techniques. This study aims to fill the gap by proposing
critique-based LLMs as recommendation systems (Critic-LLM-RS). For our purpose,
we train a separate machine-learning model called Critic that implements
collaborative filtering for recommendations by learning from the interactions
between many users and items. The Critic provides critiques to LLMs to
significantly refine the recommendations. Extensive experiments have verified
the effectiveness of Critic-LLM-RS on real datasets.

and retrieval across millions of scientific documents. Built on over 2.3
million full-text papers from arXiv.org, SQuAI employs four collaborative
agents to decompose complex questions into sub-questions, retrieve targeted
evidence via hybrid sparse-dense retrieval, and adaptively filter documents to
improve contextual relevance. To ensure faithfulness and traceability, SQuAI
integrates in-line citations for each generated claim and provides supporting
sentences from the source documents. Our system improves faithfulness, answer
relevance, and contextual relevance by up to +0.088 (12%) over a strong RAG
baseline. We further release a benchmark of 1,000 scientific
question-answer-evidence triplets to support reproducibility. With transparent
reasoning, verifiable citations, and domain-wide scalability, SQuAI
demonstrates how multi-agent RAG enables more trustworthy scientific QA with
LLMs.

### [219] [Mixture of Experts Approaches in Dense Retrieval Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15683)
*Effrosyni Sokli,Pranav Kasela,Georgios Peikos,Gabriella Pasi*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种更高效的MoE设计——单MoE块(SB-MoE)，将其置于最终Transformer层之后，相比传统每层都集成MoE的方法大幅减少了参数数量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 密集检索模型(DRMs)在信息检索中表现突出，但基于神经Transformer的模型往往难以泛化到训练任务和领域之外。先前研究在每层Transformer中集成MoE框架虽然有效，但显著增加了参数数量。

Method: 在最终Transformer层后引入单个MoE块(SB-MoE)，通过两种评估设置进行实证评估：1)在七个IR基准上微调SB-MoE并评估；2)在MSMARCO上微调后在十三个BEIR数据集上进行零样本评估。

Result: SB-MoE对轻量级基础模型(如TinyBERT、BERT-Small)特别有效，在基准测试中持续超越标准微调。对于参数更多的模型(如BERT-Base、Contriever)，需要更多训练样本才能获得改进的检索性能。

Conclusion: SB-MoE是一种参数效率更高的MoE设计，能够有效提升密集检索模型的性能，特别是在轻量级模型上表现优异，同时保持了良好的泛化能力。

Abstract: Dense Retrieval Models (DRMs) are a prominent development in Information
Retrieval (IR). A key challenge with these neural Transformer-based models is
that they often struggle to generalize beyond the specific tasks and domains
they were trained on. To address this challenge, prior research in IR
incorporated the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework within each Transformer
layer of a DRM, which, though effective, substantially increased the number of
additional parameters. In this paper, we propose a more efficient design, which
introduces a single MoE block (SB-MoE) after the final Transformer layer. To
assess the retrieval effectiveness of SB-MoE, we perform an empirical
evaluation across three IR tasks. Our experiments involve two evaluation
setups, aiming to assess both in-domain effectiveness and the model's zero-shot
generalizability. In the first setup, we fine-tune SB-MoE with four different
underlying DRMs on seven IR benchmarks and evaluate them on their respective
test sets. In the second setup, we fine-tune SB-MoE on MSMARCO and perform
zero-shot evaluation on thirteen BEIR datasets. Additionally, we perform
further experiments to analyze the model's dependency on its hyperparameters
(i.e., the number of employed and activated experts) and investigate how this
variation affects SB-MoE's performance. The obtained results show that SB-MoE
is particularly effective for DRMs with lightweight base models, such as
TinyBERT and BERT-Small, consistently exceeding standard model fine-tuning
across benchmarks. For DRMs with more parameters, such as BERT-Base and
Contriever, our model requires a larger number of training samples to achieve
improved retrieval performance. Our code is available online at:

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) show strong reasoning and text generation
capabilities, prompting their use in scientific literature analysis, including
novelty assessment. While evaluating novelty of scientific papers is crucial
for peer review, it requires extensive knowledge of related work, something not
all reviewers have. While recent work on LLM-assisted scientific literature
analysis supports literature comparison, existing approaches offer limited
transparency and lack mechanisms for result traceability via an information
retrieval module. To address this gap, we introduce $\textbf{GraphMind}$, an
easy-to-use interactive web tool designed to assist users in evaluating the
novelty of scientific papers or drafted ideas. Specially, $\textbf{GraphMind}$
enables users to capture the main structure of a scientific paper, explore
related ideas through various perspectives, and assess novelty via providing
verifiable contextual insights. $\textbf{GraphMind}$ enables users to annotate
key elements of a paper, explore related papers through various relationships,
and assess novelty with contextual insight. This tool integrates external APIs
such as arXiv and Semantic Scholar with LLMs to support annotation, extraction,
retrieval and classification of papers. This combination provides users with a
rich, structured view of a scientific idea's core contributions and its
connections to existing work. $\textbf{GraphMind}$ is available at
https://oyarsa.github.io/graphmind and a demonstration video at

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation has made significant progress in the field of
natural language processing. By combining the advantages of information
retrieval and large language models, RAG can generate relevant and contextually
appropriate responses based on items retrieved from reliable sources. This

Conclusion: FACE框架无需微调LLMs即可实现语义对齐，利用预训练能力增强推荐性能

Abstract: Recently, large language models (LLMs) have been explored for integration
with collaborative filtering (CF)-based recommendation systems, which are
crucial for personalizing user experiences. However, a key challenge is that
LLMs struggle to interpret the latent, non-semantic embeddings produced by CF
approaches, limiting recommendation effectiveness and further applications. To
address this, we propose FACE, a general interpretable framework that maps CF
embeddings into pre-trained LLM tokens. Specifically, we introduce a
disentangled projection module to decompose CF embeddings into concept-specific
vectors, followed by a quantized autoencoder to convert continuous embeddings
into LLM tokens (descriptors). Then, we design a contrastive alignment
objective to ensure that the tokens align with corresponding textual signals.
Hence, the model-agnostic FACE framework achieves semantic alignment without
fine-tuning LLMs and enhances recommendation performance by leveraging their
pre-trained capabilities. Empirical results on three real-world recommendation
datasets demonstrate performance improvements in benchmark models, with
interpretability studies confirming the interpretability of the descriptors.

TL;DR: FIRE是一个基于智能体的迭代式事实核查框架，将证据检索和声明验证集成在一起，通过统一机制决定是否给出最终答案或生成后续搜索查询，显著降低了LLM成本和搜索成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统事实核查方法通常固定检索一定数量的证据然后进行验证，这种方法成本效益不高，未能充分利用验证模型对声明的内部知识，也无法复制人类搜索策略中的迭代推理过程。

Method: FIRE采用基于智能体的框架，将证据检索和声明验证以迭代方式集成，使用统一机制根据当前判断的置信度来决定是提供最终答案还是生成后续搜索查询。

Result: 与其他强事实核查框架相比，FIRE在性能略有提升的同时，将大语言模型成本平均降低了7.6倍，搜索成本降低了16.5倍。

Conclusion: FIRE在大规模事实核查操作中具有应用前景，其迭代方法和成本效益优势使其成为有前途的解决方案。

Abstract: Fact-checking long-form text is challenging, and it is therefore common
practice to break it down into multiple atomic claims. The typical approach to
fact-checking these atomic claims involves retrieving a fixed number of pieces
of evidence, followed by a verification step. However, this method is usually
not cost-effective, as it underutilizes the verification model's internal
knowledge of the claim and fails to replicate the iterative reasoning process
in human search strategies. To address these limitations, we propose FIRE, a
novel agent-based framework that integrates evidence retrieval and claim
verification in an iterative manner. Specifically, FIRE employs a unified
mechanism to decide whether to provide a final answer or generate a subsequent
search query, based on its confidence in the current judgment. We compare FIRE
with other strong fact-checking frameworks and find that it achieves slightly
better performance while reducing large language model (LLM) costs by an
average of 7.6 times and search costs by 16.5 times. These results indicate
that FIRE holds promise for application in large-scale fact-checking
operations. Our code is available at https://github.com/mbzuai-nlp/fire.git.
