### [1] [YOLO11-CR: a Lightweight Convolution-and-Attention Framework for Accurate Fatigue Driving Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13205)
*Zhebin Jin,Ligang Dong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了YOLO11-CR模型，一种轻量级实时疲动检测方案，通过卷积波与注意力融合模块以及矩形校准模块，在DSM数据集上实现了更高的检测精度和回归率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的疲动检测方法存在争议：生理和车辆动态方法虽准确但侵入性强，视觉方法虽非侵入但对小物体和遮挡物体检测效果差。需要一种高效、轻量且适用于实际环境的解决方案。

Method: 提出YOLO11-CR模型，包含两个核心模块：
1. 卷积与注意力融合模块(CAFM)：结合CNN局部特征和Transformer全局上下文，提升特征表达能力
2. 矩形校准模块(RCM)：捕获水平和垂直上下文信息，改善特别是侧面脸和小物体(如手机)的空间定位

Result: 在DSM数据集上达到：
精度 87.17%
回归率 83.86%
mAP@50 88.09%
mAP@50-95 55.93%
显著超过基线模型，分离实验证明了CAFM和RCM模块对敏感性和定位精度的改善效果

Conclusion: YOLO11-CR提供了一种实用且高性能的车内疲动监测解决方案，具有强大的实际部署潜力。未来可以扩展时间序列建模、多模态数据融合和嵌入式优化。

Abstract: Driver fatigue detection is of paramount importance for intelligent
transportation systems due to its critical role in mitigating road traffic
accidents. While physiological and vehicle dynamics-based methods offer
accuracy, they are often intrusive, hardware-dependent, and lack robustness in
real-world environments. Vision-based techniques provide a non-intrusive and
scalable alternative, but still face challenges such as poor detection of small
or occluded objects and limited multi-scale feature modeling. To address these
issues, this paper proposes YOLO11-CR, a lightweight and efficient object
detection model tailored for real-time fatigue detection. YOLO11-CR introduces
two key modules: the Convolution-and-Attention Fusion Module (CAFM), which
integrates local CNN features with global Transformer-based context to enhance
feature expressiveness; and the Rectangular Calibration Module (RCM), which
captures horizontal and vertical contextual information to improve spatial
localization, particularly for profile faces and small objects like mobile
phones. Experiments on the DSM dataset demonstrated that YOLO11-CR achieves a
precision of 87.17%, recall of 83.86%, mAP@50 of 88.09%, and mAP@50-95 of
55.93%, outperforming baseline models significantly. Ablation studies further
validate the effectiveness of the CAFM and RCM modules in improving both
sensitivity and localization accuracy. These results demonstrate that YOLO11-CR
offers a practical and high-performing solution for in-vehicle fatigue
monitoring, with strong potential for real-world deployment and future
enhancements involving temporal modeling, multi-modal data integration, and
embedded optimization.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Mirage基准和Mirage-R1模型，用于解决真实世界中AI生成图像检测的挑战，相比现有方法在基准测试中领先5-10%


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的AI生成图像检测器在实验室环境下有效，但无法泛化到真实世界的嘈杂场景，这些图像质量参差不齐且经过多种编辑处理

Method: 构建Mirage基准数据集（包含网络收集和专家合成的真实AIGI），开发Mirage-R1视觉语言模型，采用启发式到分析式推理机制，通过监督微调和强化学习两阶段训练，并使用推理时自适应思考策略

Result: 在Mirage基准和公共基准上分别领先现有最优检测器5%和10%

Conclusion: Mirage基准有效模拟了真实世界AIGI的复杂性，Mirage-R1模型通过创新的推理机制和训练策略，在检测性能和推理速度之间取得了良好平衡

Abstract: The spreading of AI-generated images (AIGI), driven by advances in generative
AI, poses a significant threat to information security and public trust.
Existing AIGI detectors, while effective against images in clean laboratory
settings, fail to generalize to in-the-wild scenarios. These real-world images
are noisy, varying from ``obviously fake" images to realistic ones derived from
multiple generative models and further edited for quality control. We address
in-the-wild AIGI detection in this paper. We introduce Mirage, a challenging
benchmark designed to emulate the complexity of in-the-wild AIGI. Mirage is
constructed from two sources: (1) a large corpus of Internet-sourced AIGI
verified by human experts, and (2) a synthesized dataset created through the
collaboration between multiple expert generators, closely simulating the
realistic AIGI in the wild. Building on this benchmark, we propose Mirage-R1, a
vision-language model with heuristic-to-analytic reasoning, a reflective
reasoning mechanism for AIGI detection. Mirage-R1 is trained in two stages: a
supervised-fine-tuning cold start, followed by a reinforcement learning stage.
By further adopting an inference-time adaptive thinking strategy, Mirage-R1 is
able to provide either a quick judgment or a more robust and accurate
conclusion, effectively balancing inference speed and performance. Extensive
experiments show that our model leads state-of-the-art detectors by 5% and 10%
on Mirage and the public benchmark, respectively. The benchmark and code will
be made publicly available.

### [3] [DianJin-OCR-R1: Enhancing OCR Capabilities via a Reasoning-and-Tool Interleaved Vision-Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13238)
*Qian Chen,Xianyin Zhang,Lifan Guo,Feng Chen,Chi Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DianJin-OCR-R1是一个推理增强的视觉语言模型框架，通过结合自身OCR能力和专家模型工具来减少幻觉，在OCR任务上表现优于非推理模型和专家模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型在文档图像解析中存在幻觉问题，且相比专门训练的专家模型在OCR任务上效果较差，需要一种方法来结合两者的优势。

Method: 提出推理-工具交织的训练框架，模型先自行识别图像内容，然后调用专家模型工具获取参考结果，最后重新审视图像和推理过程来提供最终识别结果。

Result: 在ReST和OmniDocBench数据集上的实验表明，DianJin-OCR-R1模型持续优于非推理版本和专家OCR模型。

Conclusion: 该方法通过结合视觉语言模型的通用能力和专家模型的精准性，有效减少了幻觉问题，以较低成本提升了OCR性能。

Abstract: Recent advances in large vision-language models (LVLMs) have enabled a new
paradigm of end-to-end document image parsing, excelling in Optical Character
Recognition (OCR) tasks such as text, table, and formula recognition. However,
generative LVLMs, similarly to large language models (LLMs), are prone to
hallucinations--generating words that do not exist in input images.
Furthermore, LVLMs are designed for general purposes and tend to be less
effective on OCR tasks compared to expert models that are trained on
domain-specific datasets. In this paper, we propose DianJin-OCR-R1, a
reasoning-enhanced framework designed to address these limitations through
training reasoning-and-tool interleaved VLMs. Given a recognition instruction,
our DianJin-OCR-R1 model first recognizes the content in the input image by its
own OCR capabilities, and then calls other tools (i.e., other expert models) to
obtain their results as references, finally looks again the image and rethinks
about the reasoning process to provide the final recognized content. Since
architectures of expert models are tailored for specific OCR tasks, which makes
them less prone to hallucinations, their results can help VLMs mitigate
hallucinations. Additionally, expert models are typically smaller in scale and
easy to iterate, enabling performance improvements for VLMs at a lower cost. We
evaluate our model on ReST and OmniDocBench, and experimental results show that
our DianJin-OCR-R1 models consistently outperform their non-reasoning
counterparts and expert OCR models, which proves the effectiveness of our
method.

*Sumaiya Fazal,Sheeraz Ahmed*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 基于卷积神经网络的乌尔都语光学字符识别系统，通过组件分类和自动特征学习，在组件分类任务上达到99%的准确率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 乌尔都语作为一种草书式文字，具有复杂的几何和形态结构，传统的分割基于识别方法错误率较高，需要更有效的解决方案

Method: 使用卷积神经网络(CNN)进行自动特征学习，通过三个字符的排列组合生成数据集，并使用连通组件技术获取细体，采用两层层次神经网络处理不同程度的字符排列组合和组件分类

Result: 模型在组件分类任务上成功达到了99%的准确率

Conclusion: 组件基于分类结合CNN自动特征学习的方法能够有效地解决乌尔都语识别的挑战，为复杂草书文字的光学识别提供了有效的解决方案

Abstract: Urdu is a cursive script language and has similarities with Arabic and many
other South Asian languages. Urdu is difficult to classify due to its complex
geometrical and morphological structure. Character classification can be
processed further if segmentation technique is efficient, but due to context
sensitivity in Urdu, segmentation-based recognition often results with high
error rate. Our proposed approach for Urdu optical character recognition system
is a component-based classification relying on automatic feature learning
technique called convolutional neural network. CNN is trained and tested on
Urdu text dataset, which is generated through permutation process of three
characters and further proceeds to discarding unnecessary images by applying
connected component technique in order to obtain ligature only. Hierarchical
neural network is implemented with two levels to deal with three degrees of
character permutations and component classification Our model successfully
achieved 0.99% for component classification.

### [5] [CLoE: Curriculum Learning on Endoscopic Images for Robust MES Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13280)
*Zeynep Ozdemir,Hacer Yalim Keles,Omer Ozgur Tanriover*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CLoE是一个课程学习框架，通过图像质量评估标签可靠性并结合序数结构，提升溃疡性结肠炎内镜图像严重程度分类的准确性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mayo内镜评分(MES)分类面临观察者间变异导致的标签噪声和序数性质被忽略的挑战，需要同时考虑标签可靠性和序数结构的解决方案

Method: 使用基于波士顿肠道准备量表(BBPS)训练的轻量模型估计图像质量作为标注置信度代理，构建从易到难的课程学习，结合ResizeMix数据增强

Result: 在LIMUC和HyperKvasir数据集上，CLoE显著提升CNN和Transformer性能，ConvNeXt-Tiny达到82.5%准确率和0.894 QWK

Conclusion: 难度感知训练策略能有效改善标签不确定性下的序数分类性能，具有重要临床应用价值

Abstract: Estimating disease severity from endoscopic images is essential in assessing
ulcerative colitis, where the Mayo Endoscopic Subscore (MES) is widely used to
grade inflammation. However, MES classification remains challenging due to
label noise from inter-observer variability and the ordinal nature of the
score, which standard models often ignore. We propose CLoE, a curriculum
learning framework that accounts for both label reliability and ordinal
structure. Image quality, estimated via a lightweight model trained on Boston
Bowel Preparation Scale (BBPS) labels, is used as a proxy for annotation
confidence to order samples from easy (clean) to hard (noisy). This curriculum
is further combined with ResizeMix augmentation to improve robustness.
Experiments on the LIMUC and HyperKvasir datasets, using both CNNs and
Transformers, show that CLoE consistently improves performance over strong
supervised and self-supervised baselines. For instance, ConvNeXt-Tiny reaches
82.5\% accuracy and a QWK of 0.894 on LIMUC with low computational cost. These
results highlight the potential of difficulty-aware training strategies for
improving ordinal classification under label uncertainty. Code will be released
at https://github.com/zeynepozdemir/CLoE.

### [6] [GaitCrafter: Diffusion Model for Biometric Preserving Gait Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13300)
*Sirshapan Mitra,Yogesh S. Rawat*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GaitCrafter是一个基于扩散模型的步态序列合成框架，能够在轮廓域生成真实且身份保持的步态数据，支持多种条件控制并保护隐私。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决步态识别中大规模标注数据缺乏、样本收集困难以及隐私保护的问题。

Method: 训练视频扩散模型，专门处理步态轮廓数据，支持基于服装、携带物品、视角等多种条件的可控生成，并通过身份嵌入插值生成新身份。

Result: 合成样本能提升步态识别性能（特别是在挑战性条件下），生成的新身份具有独特且一致的步态模式，适用于隐私保护训练。

Conclusion: 该工作推动了扩散模型在高质量、可控且隐私保护的步态数据生成中的应用。

Abstract: Gait recognition is a valuable biometric task that enables the identification
of individuals from a distance based on their walking patterns. However, it
remains limited by the lack of large-scale labeled datasets and the difficulty
of collecting diverse gait samples for each individual while preserving
privacy. To address these challenges, we propose GaitCrafter, a diffusion-based
framework for synthesizing realistic gait sequences in the silhouette domain.
Unlike prior works that rely on simulated environments or alternative
generative models, GaitCrafter trains a video diffusion model from scratch,
exclusively on gait silhouette data. Our approach enables the generation of
temporally consistent and identity-preserving gait sequences. Moreover, the
generation process is controllable-allowing conditioning on various covariates
such as clothing, carried objects, and view angle. We show that incorporating
synthetic samples generated by GaitCrafter into the gait recognition pipeline
leads to improved performance, especially under challenging conditions.
Additionally, we introduce a mechanism to generate novel identities-synthetic
individuals not present in the original dataset-by interpolating identity
embeddings. These novel identities exhibit unique, consistent gait patterns and
are useful for training models while maintaining privacy of real subjects.
Overall, our work takes an important step toward leveraging diffusion models
for high-quality, controllable, and privacy-aware gait data generation.

### [7] [Prune2Drive: A Plug-and-Play Framework for Accelerating Vision-Language Models in Autonomous Driving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13305)
*Minhao Xiong,Zichen Wen,Zhuangcheng Gu,Xuyang Liu,Rui Zhang,Hengrui Kang,Jiabing Yang,Junyuan Zhang,Weijia Li,Conghui He,Yafei Wang,Linfeng Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Prune2Drive是一个即插即用的视觉token剪枝框架，用于自动驾驶中的多视角视觉语言模型，通过多样性感知token选择和视图自适应剪枝控制，在保持性能的同时显著提升推理速度和减少内存消耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶系统中的视觉语言模型需要处理高分辨率多视角图像，产生大量视觉token导致计算开销巨大，推理延迟和内存消耗成为部署瓶颈。

Method: 提出两种核心创新：1）基于最远点采样的多样性感知token选择机制，优先考虑跨视图的语义和空间覆盖；2）视图自适应剪枝控制器，根据各摄像头对下游驾驶任务的重要性学习最优剪枝比例。

Result: 在两个大规模多视角驾驶基准测试中，仅保留10%视觉token时实现6.4倍预填充加速，FLOPs降至13.4%，性能仅下降3%。

Conclusion: Prune2Drive无需模型重训练或注意力图访问，与现代高效注意力实现兼容，为自动驾驶视觉语言模型的高效部署提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have emerged as a promising paradigm in
autonomous driving (AD), offering a unified framework for perception,
reasoning, and decision-making by jointly modeling visual inputs and natural
language instructions. However, their deployment is hindered by the significant
computational overhead incurred when processing high-resolution, multi-view
images, a standard setup in AD systems with six or more synchronized cameras.
This overhead stems from the large number of visual tokens generated during
encoding, increasing inference latency and memory consumption due to the
quadratic complexity of self-attention. To address these challenges, we propose
Prune2Drive, a plug-and-play visual token pruning framework for multi-view VLMs
in autonomous driving. Prune2Drive introduces two core innovations: (i) a
diversity-aware token selection mechanism inspired by farthest point sampling,
which prioritizes semantic and spatial coverage across views rather than
relying solely on attention scores, and (ii) a view-adaptive pruning controller
that learns optimal pruning ratios for each camera view based on their
importance to downstream driving tasks. Unlike prior methods, Prune2Drive does
not require model retraining or access to attention maps, making it compatible
with modern efficient attention implementations. Extensive experiments on two
large-scale multi-view driving benchmarks, DriveLM and DriveLMM-o1, show that
Prune2Drive achieves significant speedups and memory savings while maintaining
or improving task performance. When retaining only 10% of the visual tokens,
our method achieves a 6.40$\times$ speedup in the prefilling phase and consumes
13.4% of the original FLOPs, with only a 3% performance drop on the DriveLM
benchmark.

### [8] [DAASH: A Meta-Attack Framework for Synthesizing Effective and Stealthy Adversarial Examples](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13309)
*Abdullah Al Nomaan Nafi,Habibur Rahaman,Zafaryab Haider,Tanzim Mahfuz,Fnu Suya,Swarup Bhunia,Prabuddha Chakraborty*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DAASH是一个完全可微分的元攻击框架，通过战略性地组合现有的Lp范数攻击方法，生成有效且感知对齐的对抗样本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的Lp范数约束对抗样本往往与人类感知不一致，且不清楚Lp约束攻击的见解是否能有效提升感知效果。需要一种能够生成感知对齐对抗样本的方法。

Method: 采用多阶段方式运行：每个阶段使用学习到的自适应权重聚合多个基础攻击的候选对抗样本，并将结果传播到下一阶段。通过新颖的元损失函数联合最小化误分类损失和感知失真。

Result: 在CIFAR-10、CIFAR-100和ImageNet上的对抗训练模型上评估，DAASH显著优于最先进的感知攻击方法AdvAD，攻击成功率提高20.63%，在SSIM、LPIPS和FID指标上分别提升约11、0.015和5.7。

Conclusion: DAASH能够很好地泛化到未见过的防御方法，是评估鲁棒性的实用且强大的基线，无需为每个新防御手工设计自适应攻击。

Abstract: Numerous techniques have been proposed for generating adversarial examples in
white-box settings under strict Lp-norm constraints. However, such norm-bounded
examples often fail to align well with human perception, and only recently have
a few methods begun specifically exploring perceptually aligned adversarial
examples. Moreover, it remains unclear whether insights from Lp-constrained
attacks can be effectively leveraged to improve perceptual efficacy. In this
paper, we introduce DAASH, a fully differentiable meta-attack framework that
generates effective and perceptually aligned adversarial examples by
strategically composing existing Lp-based attack methods. DAASH operates in a
multi-stage fashion: at each stage, it aggregates candidate adversarial
examples from multiple base attacks using learned, adaptive weights and
propagates the result to the next stage. A novel meta-loss function guides this
process by jointly minimizing misclassification loss and perceptual distortion,
enabling the framework to dynamically modulate the contribution of each base
attack throughout the stages. We evaluate DAASH on adversarially trained models
across CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet. Despite relying solely on
Lp-constrained based methods, DAASH significantly outperforms state-of-the-art
perceptual attacks such as AdvAD -- achieving higher attack success rates
(e.g., 20.63\% improvement) and superior visual quality, as measured by SSIM,
LPIPS, and FID (improvements $\approx$ of 11, 0.015, and 5.7, respectively).
Furthermore, DAASH generalizes well to unseen defenses, making it a practical
and strong baseline for evaluating robustness without requiring handcrafted
adaptive attacks for each new defense.

Method: 构建了最大的稳健前后对照面部图像数据集（7,160张照片，1,259名患者），利用自动化标记点检测、几何面部对称性计算、深度学习年龄估计和鼻部形态分析等技术

Result: 在美容鼻手术子集中，96.2%患者至少在一项鼻部指标上显示改善；在更广泛的面部图像组中，71.3%患者在全局面部对称性或感知年龄方面显示显著改善，同时确保了手术后患者身份识别的一致性

Conclusion: 该框架为面部塑形手术提供了可重复、定量的评估标准，有助于数据驱动的手术规划、患者沟通和客观效果分析，推动整个行业的发展

Abstract: We introduce a scalable, interpretable computer-vision framework for
quantifying aesthetic outcomes of facial plastic surgery using frontal
photographs. Our pipeline leverages automated landmark detection, geometric
facial symmetry computation, deep-learning-based age estimation, and nasal
morphology analysis. To perform this study, we first assemble the largest
curated dataset of paired pre- and post-operative facial images to date,
encompassing 7,160 photographs from 1,259 patients. This dataset includes a
dedicated rhinoplasty-only subset consisting of 732 images from 366 patients,
96.2% of whom showed improvement in at least one of the three nasal
measurements with statistically significant group-level change. Among these
patients, the greatest statistically significant improvements (p < 0.001)
occurred in the alar width to face width ratio (77.0%), nose length to face
height ratio (41.5%), and alar width to intercanthal ratio (39.3%). Among the
broader frontal-view cohort, comprising 989 rigorously filtered subjects, 71.3%
exhibited significant enhancements in global facial symmetry or perceived age
(p < 0.01). Importantly, our analysis shows that patient identity remains
consistent post-operatively, with True Match Rates of 99.5% and 99.6% at a
False Match Rate of 0.01% for the rhinoplasty-specific and general patient
cohorts, respectively. Additionally, we analyze inter-practitioner variability
in improvement rates. By providing reproducible, quantitative benchmarks and a
novel dataset, our pipeline facilitates data-driven surgical planning, patient
counseling, and objective outcome evaluation across practices.

Motivation: 大型语言模型虽然能力突出，但高计算成本、限制的访问性和数据隐私问题阻碍了其在资源受限的医疗环境中的应用。

Method: 使用NIH胸部X光数据集，评估多个小型语言模型在胸部X光位置分类（AP与PA）任务上的表现，测试三种提示策略：基准指令、逐步摘要提示和纠正反思提示。

Result: 结果显示某些小型语言模型通过精心设计的提示可以达到竞争性的准确度。

Conclusion: 提示工程可以在不需要深度AI专业知识的情况下实质性提升小型语言模型在医疗健康应用中的性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in natural
language processing and multi-modal understanding. However, their high
computational cost, limited accessibility, and data privacy concerns hinder
their adoption in resource-constrained healthcare environments. This study
investigates the performance of small language models (SLMs) in a medical
imaging classification task, comparing different models and prompt designs to
identify the optimal combination for accuracy and usability. Using the NIH
Chest X-ray dataset, we evaluate multiple SLMs on the task of classifying chest
X-ray positions (anteroposterior [AP] vs. posteroanterior [PA]) under three
prompt strategies: baseline instruction, incremental summary prompts, and
correction-based reflective prompts. Our results show that certain SLMs achieve
competitive accuracy with well-crafted prompts, suggesting that prompt
engineering can substantially enhance SLM performance in healthcare
applications without requiring deep AI expertise from end users.

### [12] [Mitigating Easy Option Bias in Multiple-Choice Question Answering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13428)
*Hao Zhang,Chen Li,Basura Fernando*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文发现多选题视觉问答平台存在"易选项偏巾"(EOB)问题，视觉-语言模型只需根据图像和选项就能猜出正确答案，无需问题信息。研究提出了GroundAttack工具生成难选项来消除这种偏巾，从而更准确评估模型的真实能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多选题视觉问答平台存在系统性偏巾，模型可以不依赖问题信息仅通过图像-选项相似性就能选出正确答案，这影响了对视觉-语言模型真实能力的评估。

Method: 通过基础实验识别出偏巾来源于视觉相关性不平衡：正确答案在特征空间与图像内容更为一致。提出GroundAttack工具自动生成与正确答案视觉可能性相似的难选项，消除EOB偏巾。

Result: 在消除EOB偏巾的新注释上，当前视觉-语言模型在仅使用图像+选项的情况下几乎随机猜测，在完整图像+问题+选项情况下的准确率也下降到非饱和水平，提供了更现实的能力评估。

Conclusion: 多选题VQA平台存在明显的Easy-Options Bias问题，影响模型能力评估的准确性。通过GroundAttack生成难选项可以有效消除这种偏巾，构建更加可靠的测试数据集，为视觉-语言模型的真实能力测试提供了更好的基础。

Abstract: In this early study, we observe an Easy-Options Bias (EOB) issue in some
multiple-choice Visual Question Answering (VQA) benchmarks such as MMStar,
RealWorldQA, SEED-Bench, Next-QA, STAR benchmark and Video-MME. This bias
allows vision-language models (VLMs) to select the correct answer using only
the vision (V) and options (O) as inputs, without the need for the question
(Q). Through grounding experiments, we attribute the bias to an imbalance in
visual relevance: the correct answer typically aligns more closely with the
visual contents than the negative options in feature space, creating a shortcut
for VLMs to infer the answer via simply vision-option similarity matching. To
fix this, we introduce GroundAttack, a toolkit that automatically generates
hard negative options as visually plausible as the correct answer. We apply it
to the NExT-QA and MMStar datasets, creating new EOB-free annotations. On these
EOB-free annotations, current VLMs approach to random accuracies under (V+O)
settings, and drop to non-saturated accuracies under (V+Q+O) settings,
providing a more realistic evaluation of VLMs' QA ability. Codes and new
annotations will be released soon.

Abstract: Comprehensive highway scene understanding and robust traffic risk inference
are vital for advancing Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) and autonomous
driving. Traditional approaches often struggle with scalability and
generalization, particularly under the complex and dynamic conditions of
real-world environments. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel
structured prompting and knowledge distillation framework that enables
automatic generation of high-quality traffic scene annotations and contextual
risk assessments. Our framework orchestrates two large Vision-Language Models
(VLMs): GPT-4o and o3-mini, using a structured Chain-of-Thought (CoT) strategy
to produce rich, multi-perspective outputs. These outputs serve as
knowledge-enriched pseudo-annotations for supervised fine-tuning of a much
smaller student VLM. The resulting compact 3B-scale model, named VISTA (Vision
for Intelligent Scene and Traffic Analysis), is capable of understanding
low-resolution traffic videos and generating semantically faithful, risk-aware
captions. Despite its significantly reduced parameter count, VISTA achieves
strong performance across established captioning metrics (BLEU-4, METEOR,
ROUGE-L, and CIDEr) when benchmarked against its teacher models. This
demonstrates that effective knowledge distillation and structured multi-agent
supervision can empower lightweight VLMs to capture complex reasoning
capabilities. The compact architecture of VISTA facilitates efficient
deployment on edge devices, enabling real-time risk monitoring without
requiring extensive infrastructure upgrades.

Abstract: Achieving disentangled control over multiple facial motions and accommodating
diverse input modalities greatly enhances the application and entertainment of
the talking head generation. This necessitates a deep exploration of the
decoupling space for facial features, ensuring that they a) operate
independently without mutual interference and b) can be preserved to share with
different modal inputs, both aspects often neglected in existing methods. To
address this gap, this paper proposes EDTalk++, a novel full disentanglement
framework for controllable talking head generation. Our framework enables
individual manipulation of mouth shape, head pose, eye movement, and emotional
expression, conditioned on video or audio inputs. Specifically, we employ four
lightweight modules to decompose the facial dynamics into four distinct latent
spaces representing mouth, pose, eye, and expression, respectively. Each space
is characterized by a set of learnable bases whose linear combinations define
specific motions. To ensure independence and accelerate training, we enforce
orthogonality among bases and devise an efficient training strategy to allocate
motion responsibilities to each space without relying on external knowledge.
The learned bases are then stored in corresponding banks, enabling shared
visual priors with audio input. Furthermore, considering the properties of each
space, we propose an Audio-to-Motion module for audio-driven talking head
synthesis. Experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of
EDTalk++.

Abstract: Kidney stone classification from endoscopic images is critical for
personalized treatment and recurrence prevention. While convolutional neural
networks (CNNs) have shown promise in this task, their limited ability to
capture long-range dependencies can hinder performance under variable imaging
conditions. This study presents a comparative analysis between Vision
Transformers (ViTs) and CNN-based models, evaluating their performance on two
ex vivo datasets comprising CCD camera and flexible ureteroscope images. The
ViT-base model pretrained on ImageNet-21k consistently outperformed a ResNet50
baseline across multiple imaging conditions. For instance, in the most visually
complex subset (Section patches from endoscopic images), the ViT model achieved
95.2% accuracy and 95.1% F1-score, compared to 64.5% and 59.3% with ResNet50.
In the mixed-view subset from CCD-camera images, ViT reached 87.1% accuracy
versus 78.4% with CNN. These improvements extend across precision and recall as
well. The results demonstrate that ViT-based architectures provide superior
classification performance and offer a scalable alternative to conventional
CNNs for kidney stone image analysis.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统隐式神经表示(INR)为每张图像单独使用神经网络导致的计算和存储效率低下问题。

Method: 分析训练好的INR层间权重分布，发现中间层分布模式高度相似，因此共享中间层而保留输入输出层为图像特定，并为每张图像设计额外的投影层来捕获独特特征。

Result: 在图像重建和超分辨率任务中，MINR节省60%参数的同时保持可比性能，处理100张图像时平均PSNR达34dB。

Conclusion: MINR方法有效解决了多图像编码的效率问题，具有很好的扩展性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) aim to parameterize discrete signals
through implicit continuous functions. However, formulating each image with a
separate neural network~(typically, a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)) leads to
computational and storage inefficiencies when encoding multi-images. To address
this issue, we propose MINR, sharing specific layers to encode multi-image
efficiently. We first compare the layer-wise weight distributions for several
trained INRs and find that corresponding intermediate layers follow highly
similar distribution patterns. Motivated by this, we share these intermediate
layers across multiple images while preserving the input and output layers as
input-specific. In addition, we design an extra novel projection layer for each
image to capture its unique features. Experimental results on image
reconstruction and super-resolution tasks demonstrate that MINR can save up to
60\% parameters while maintaining comparable performance. Particularly, MINR
scales effectively to handle 100 images, maintaining an average peak
signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) of 34 dB. Further analysis of various backbones
proves the robustness of the proposed MINR.

TL;DR: DHQ是一种针对隐式神经表示(INRs)的分布感知Hadamard量化方案，同时量化权重和激活值，通过Hadamard变换将不同分布标准化为统一钟形分布，显著提升硬件效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: INRs虽然性能优越但依赖全精度计算，硬件开销大。现有量化方法主要关注权重量化，缺乏激活量化，硬件节省有限。需要同时量化权重和激活值来充分利用量化硬件优势。

Method: 提出DHQ方案：1)分析发现INRs中首尾层权重和激活值分布与其他层不同；2)使用Hadamard变换将这些不同分布标准化为统一钟形分布；3)应用标准量化器进行量化；4)在FPGA上实现硬件高效方案。

Result: 在多种图像重建任务中，DHQ相比全精度版本：延迟降低32.7%，能耗降低40.1%，资源利用率最高提升98.3%，优于先前量化方法。

Conclusion: DHQ通过分布感知的Hadamard量化方案有效解决了INRs量化问题，在保持性能的同时显著提升了硬件效率，为INRs的实际部署提供了可行的量化解决方案。

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) encode discrete signals using
Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) with complex activation functions. While INRs
achieve superior performance, they depend on full-precision number
representation for accurate computation, resulting in significant hardware
overhead. Previous INR quantization approaches have primarily focused on weight
quantization, offering only limited hardware savings due to the lack of
activation quantization. To fully exploit the hardware benefits of
quantization, we propose DHQ, a novel distribution-aware Hadamard quantization
scheme that targets both weights and activations in INRs. Our analysis shows
that the weights in the first and last layers have distributions distinct from
those in the intermediate layers, while the activations in the last layer
differ significantly from those in the preceding layers. Instead of customizing
quantizers individually, we utilize the Hadamard transformation to standardize
these diverse distributions into a unified bell-shaped form, supported by both
empirical evidence and theoretical analysis, before applying a standard
quantizer. To demonstrate the practical advantages of our approach, we present
an FPGA implementation of DHQ that highlights its hardware efficiency.
Experiments on diverse image reconstruction tasks show that DHQ outperforms
previous quantization methods, reducing latency by 32.7\%, energy consumption
by 40.1\%, and resource utilization by up to 98.3\% compared to full-precision
counterparts.

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) encode discrete signals in a
continuous manner using neural networks, demonstrating significant value across
various multimedia applications. However, the vulnerability of INRs presents a
critical challenge for their real-world deployments, as the network weights
might be subjected to unavoidable perturbations. In this work, we investigate
the robustness of INRs for the first time and find that even minor
perturbations can lead to substantial performance degradation in the quality of
signal reconstruction. To mitigate this issue, we formulate the robustness
problem in INRs by minimizing the difference between loss with and without
weight perturbations. Furthermore, we derive a novel robust loss function to
regulate the gradient of the reconstruction loss with respect to weights,
thereby enhancing the robustness. Extensive experiments on reconstruction tasks
across multiple modalities demonstrate that our method achieves up to a 7.5~dB
improvement in peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) values compared to original
INRs under noisy conditions.

Conclusion: FAMNet通过2D/3D CNN融合和多任务学习，能够有效提取微表情的全方位特征，显著提升了微表情识别的性能

Abstract: Micro-expressions recognition (MER) has essential application value in many
fields, but the short duration and low intensity of micro-expressions (MEs)
bring considerable challenges to MER. The current MER methods in deep learning
mainly include three data loading methods: static images, dynamic image
sequence, and a combination of the two streams. How to effectively extract MEs'
fine-grained and spatiotemporal features has been difficult to solve. This
paper proposes a new MER method based on multi-task learning and hierarchical
attention, which fully extracts MEs' omni-directional features by merging 2D
and 3D CNNs. The fusion model consists of a 2D CNN AMNet2D and a 3D CNN
AMNet3D, with similar structures consisting of a shared backbone network
Resnet18 and attention modules. During training, the model adopts different
data loading methods to adapt to two specific networks respectively, jointly
trains on the tasks of MER and facial action unit detection (FAUD), and adopts
the parameter hard sharing for information association, which further improves
the effect of the MER task, and the final fused model is called FAMNet.
Extensive experimental results show that our proposed FAMNet significantly
improves task performance. On the SAMM, CASME II and MMEW datasets, FAMNet
achieves 83.75% (UAR) and 84.03% (UF1). Furthermore, on the challenging
CAS(ME)$^3$ dataset, FAMNet achieves 51% (UAR) and 43.42% (UF1).

Abstract: 4D radar-based object detection has garnered great attention for its
robustness in adverse weather conditions and capacity to deliver rich spatial

noisy nature of 4D radar point clouds poses substantial challenges for
effective perception. To address the limitation, we present CORENet, a novel
cross-modal denoising framework that leverages LiDAR supervision to identify
noise patterns and extract discriminative features from raw 4D radar data.
Designed as a plug-and-play architecture, our solution enables seamless
integration into voxel-based detection frameworks without modifying existing
pipelines. Notably, the proposed method only utilizes LiDAR data for
cross-modal supervision during training while maintaining full radar-only
operation during inference. Extensive evaluation on the challenging Dual-Radar
dataset, which is characterized by elevated noise level, demonstrates the
effectiveness of our framework in enhancing detection robustness. Comprehensive
experiments validate that CORENet achieves superior performance compared to

Conclusion: BDCL框架通过双级解耦和一致性学习有效提升了多视图聚类的性能，增强了特征的簇间区分性和簇内紧凑性

Abstract: Multi-view clustering has shown to be an effective method for analyzing
underlying patterns in multi-view data. The performance of clustering can be
improved by learning the consistency and complementarity between multi-view
features, however, cluster-oriented representation learning is often
overlooked. In this paper, we propose a novel Bi-level Decoupling and
Consistency Learning framework (BDCL) to further explore the effective
representation for multi-view data to enhance inter-cluster discriminability
and intra-cluster compactness of features in multi-view clustering. Our
framework comprises three modules: 1) The multi-view instance learning module
aligns the consistent information while preserving the private features between
views through reconstruction autoencoder and contrastive learning. 2) The
bi-level decoupling of features and clusters enhances the discriminability of
feature space and cluster space. 3) The consistency learning module treats the
different views of the sample and their neighbors as positive pairs, learns the
consistency of their clustering assignments, and further compresses the
intra-cluster space. Experimental results on five benchmark datasets
demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method compared with the SOTA
methods. Our code is published on https://github.com/LouisDong95/BDCL.

Method: 采用强化学习算法，集成包含运动模糊和噪声模拟的图像合成流程，利用语义信息和曝光直方图来动态选择最优的ISO和快门速度序列

Result: 在多个数据集上达到了状态前沿性能，能够根据用户定义的曝光时间预算选择比传统方案更好的曝光策略

Conclusion: AdaptiveAE通过考虑动态场景特性和曝光参数间的复杂交互，有效提升了HDR图像的重建质量，为动态环境中的高质量HDR拍摄提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Mainstream high dynamic range imaging techniques typically rely on fusing
multiple images captured with different exposure setups (shutter speed and
ISO). A good balance between shutter speed and ISO is crucial for achieving
high-quality HDR, as high ISO values introduce significant noise, while long
shutter speeds can lead to noticeable motion blur. However, existing methods
often overlook the complex interaction between shutter speed and ISO and fail
to account for motion blur effects in dynamic scenes.
  In this work, we propose AdaptiveAE, a reinforcement learning-based method
that optimizes the selection of shutter speed and ISO combinations to maximize
HDR reconstruction quality in dynamic environments. AdaptiveAE integrates an
image synthesis pipeline that incorporates motion blur and noise simulation
into our training procedure, leveraging semantic information and exposure
histograms. It can adaptively select optimal ISO and shutter speed sequences
based on a user-defined exposure time budget, and find a better exposure
schedule than traditional solutions. Experimental results across multiple
datasets demonstrate that it achieves the state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Badminton is known as one of the fastest racket sports in the world. Despite
doubles matches being more prevalent in international tournaments than singles,
previous research has mainly focused on singles due to the challenges in data
availability and multi-person tracking. To address this gap, we designed an
approach that transfers singles-trained models to doubles analysis. We
extracted keypoints from the ShuttleSet single matches dataset using ViT-Pose
and embedded them through a contrastive learning framework based on ST-GCN. To
improve tracking stability, we incorporated a custom multi-object tracking
algorithm that resolves ID switching issues from fast and overlapping player
movements. A Transformer-based classifier then determines shot occurrences
based on the learned embeddings. Our findings demonstrate the feasibility of
extending pose-based shot recognition to doubles badminton, broadening
analytics capabilities. This work establishes a foundation for doubles-specific
datasets to enhance understanding of this predominant yet understudied format

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的量化基于标记化器（如VQ-GAN）主要关注外观特征，忽视了几何结构，导致结构信息编码不足

Method: 提出Visual Gaussian Quantization (VGQ)框架，将2D高斯分布集成到传统视觉码本量化框架中，通过直接对位置、旋转、缩放等结构参数建模来捐捕几何和空间结构

Result: 在ImageNet 256x256测试上，VGQ达刺rFID 1.00的强劲重建质量；通过增加高斯密度，进一步达刺rFID 0.556和PSNR 24.93的最优结果，显著超过现有方法

Conclusion: VGQ为图像标记化提供了新的范式，通过明确地强化结构建模能够有效捐捕丰富的视觉信息，在标记效率和视觉丰富性之间实现了灵活的权衡

Abstract: The image tokenizer is a critical component in AR image generation, as it
determines how rich and structured visual content is encoded into compact
representations. Existing quantization-based tokenizers such as VQ-GAN
primarily focus on appearance features like texture and color, often neglecting
geometric structures due to their patch-based design. In this work, we explored
how to incorporate more visual information into the tokenizer and proposed a
new framework named Visual Gaussian Quantization (VGQ), a novel tokenizer
paradigm that explicitly enhances structural modeling by integrating 2D
Gaussians into traditional visual codebook quantization frameworks. Our
approach addresses the inherent limitations of naive quantization methods such
as VQ-GAN, which struggle to model structured visual information due to their
patch-based design and emphasis on texture and color. In contrast, VGQ encodes
image latents as 2D Gaussian distributions, effectively capturing geometric and
spatial structures by directly modeling structure-related parameters such as
position, rotation and scale. We further demonstrate that increasing the
density of 2D Gaussians within the tokens leads to significant gains in
reconstruction fidelity, providing a flexible trade-off between token
efficiency and visual richness. On the ImageNet 256x256 benchmark, VGQ achieves
strong reconstruction quality with an rFID score of 1.00. Furthermore, by
increasing the density of 2D Gaussians within the tokens, VGQ gains a
significant boost in reconstruction capability and achieves a state-of-the-art
reconstruction rFID score of 0.556 and a PSNR of 24.93, substantially
outperforming existing methods. Codes will be released soon.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种基于几何形状知识的分布检验框架，利用基础模型的特征分布跨领域可转移性，在联邦学习和长尾分布识别中有效应对数据异质性和样本不平衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习中观察样本与真实分布的差距是一个持续挑战，由样本偏差、噪声等因素导致。基础模型时代为解决这一问题提供了新机遇。

Method: 利用现成的视觉基础模型（如CLIP、DINOv2）进行特征提取，发现特征分布的几何形状具有显著的跨领域可转移性。构建几何知识导向的分布检验框架，在联邦学习中获取全局几何形状并生成新样本，在长尾分布中进行知识转移来恢复尾部类别的真实分布。

Conclusion: 通过涉及基础模型特征分布几何形状的深入分析，该研究为解决深度学习中的数据分布差距问题提供了一种新的有效途径，在实际应用场景中显示出良好的效果。

Abstract: Despite the fast progress of deep learning, one standing challenge is the gap
of the observed training samples and the underlying true distribution. There
are multiple reasons for the causing of this gap e.g. sampling bias, noise etc.
In the era of foundation models, we show that when leveraging the off-the-shelf
(vision) foundation models (e.g., CLIP, DINOv2) for feature extraction, the
geometric shapes of the resulting feature distributions exhibit remarkable
transferability across domains and datasets. To verify its practical
usefulness, we embody our geometric knowledge-guided distribution calibration
framework in two popular and challenging settings: federated learning and
long-tailed recognition. In the federated setting, we devise a technique of
acquiring the global geometric shape under privacy constraints, then leverage
this knowledge to generate new samples for clients, in the aim of bridging the
gap between local and global observations. In long-tailed learning, it utilizes
the geometric knowledge transferred from sample-rich categories to recover the
true distribution for sample-scarce tail classes. Comprehensive experiments
show that our proposed geometric knowledge-guided distribution calibration
effectively overcomes information deficits caused by data heterogeneity and
sample imbalance, with boosted performance across benchmarks.

Abstract: Facial Emotion Recognition (FER) is crucial for applications such as
human-computer interaction and mental health diagnostics. This study presents
the first empirical comparison of open-source Vision-Language Models (VLMs),
including Phi-3.5 Vision and CLIP, against traditional deep learning models
VGG19, ResNet-50, and EfficientNet-B0 on the challenging FER-2013 dataset,
which contains 35,887 low-resolution grayscale images across seven emotion
classes. To address the mismatch between VLM training assumptions and the noisy
nature of FER data, we introduce a novel pipeline that integrates GFPGAN-based
image restoration with FER evaluation. Results show that traditional models,
particularly EfficientNet-B0 (86.44%) and ResNet-50 (85.72%), significantly
outperform VLMs like CLIP (64.07%) and Phi-3.5 Vision (51.66%), highlighting
the limitations of VLMs in low-quality visual tasks. In addition to performance
evaluation using precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy, we provide a
detailed computational cost analysis covering preprocessing, training,
inference, and evaluation phases, offering practical insights for deployment.
This work underscores the need for adapting VLMs to noisy environments and
provides a reproducible benchmark for future research in emotion recognition.

Motivation: 现有的3DGS基于头部虚拟人重建方法在捕捉细粒度面部表情和保持局部纹理连续性方面面临挑战，特别是在高变形区域

Method: 提出稀疏表情控制机制，用少量关键高斯影响邻近高斯的变形，并利用预训练生成模型的高质量3D先验知识提供更可靠的面部几何结构指导

Result: 实验结果表明该方法能够产生更准确、视觉一致的头部重建结果，在表情可控性和细节保真度方面都有显著提升

Conclusion: EAvatar框架通过表情感知和变形感知的设计，有效解决了高保真头部虚拟人重建中的细粒度表情捕捉和纹理连续性问题

Abstract: High-fidelity head avatar reconstruction plays a crucial role in AR/VR,
gaming, and multimedia content creation. Recent advances in 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS) have demonstrated effectiveness in modeling complex geometry
with real-time rendering capability and are now widely used in high-fidelity
head avatar reconstruction tasks. However, existing 3DGS-based methods still
face significant challenges in capturing fine-grained facial expressions and
preserving local texture continuity, especially in highly deformable regions.
To mitigate these limitations, we propose a novel 3DGS-based framework termed
EAvatar for head reconstruction that is both expression-aware and
deformation-aware. Our method introduces a sparse expression control mechanism,
where a small number of key Gaussians are used to influence the deformation of
their neighboring Gaussians, enabling accurate modeling of local deformations
and fine-scale texture transitions. Furthermore, we leverage high-quality 3D
priors from pretrained generative models to provide a more reliable facial
geometry, offering structural guidance that improves convergence stability and
shape accuracy during training. Experimental results demonstrate that our
method produces more accurate and visually coherent head reconstructions with
improved expression controllability and detail fidelity.

TL;DR: FLAIR提出了一种频率和局部性感知的隐式神经表示方法，通过RC-GAUSS激活函数和WEGE编码机制解决现有INR方法的频率选择性和空间定位不足问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有隐式神经表示缺乏频率选择性、空间定位和稀疏表示能力，导致过度依赖冗余信号分量，出现频谱偏差问题，难以捕捉高频细节。

Method: 提出FLAIR方法，包含两个关键创新：1）RC-GAUSS激活函数，在时频不确定性原理约束下实现显式频率选择和空间定位；2）WEGE编码，利用离散小波变换计算能量分数来显式指导频率信息。

Result: 在2D图像表示和恢复以及3D重建任务中，该方法持续优于现有隐式神经表示方法。

Conclusion: FLAIR通过频率感知机制有效解决了隐式神经表示中的频谱偏差问题，显著提升了表示性能。

Abstract: Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) leverage neural networks to map
coordinates to corresponding signals, enabling continuous and compact
representations. This paradigm has driven significant advances in various
vision tasks. However, existing INRs lack frequency selectivity, spatial
localization, and sparse representations, leading to an over-reliance on
redundant signal components. Consequently, they exhibit spectral bias, tending
to learn low-frequency components early while struggling to capture fine
high-frequency details. To address these issues, we propose FLAIR (Frequency-
and Locality-Aware Implicit Neural Representations), which incorporates two key
innovations. The first is RC-GAUSS, a novel activation designed for explicit
frequency selection and spatial localization under the constraints of the
time-frequency uncertainty principle (TFUP). The second is
Wavelet-Energy-Guided Encoding (WEGE), which leverages the discrete wavelet
transform (DWT) to compute energy scores and explicitly guide frequency
information to the network. Our method consistently outperforms existing INRs
in 2D image representation and restoration, as well as 3D reconstruction.

Conclusion: 纯软件注视预测可用于VR注视点渲染，使性能提升更易于在不同VR平台和应用中部署，无需额外硬件要求

Abstract: Foveated rendering significantly reduces computational demands in virtual
reality applications by concentrating rendering quality where users focus their
gaze. Current approaches require expensive hardware-based eye tracking systems,
limiting widespread adoption due to cost, calibration complexity, and hardware
compatibility constraints. This paper presents GazeProphet, a software-only
approach for predicting gaze locations in VR environments without requiring
dedicated eye tracking hardware. The approach combines a Spherical Vision
Transformer for processing 360-degree VR scenes with an LSTM-based temporal
encoder that captures gaze sequence patterns. A multi-modal fusion network
integrates spatial scene features with temporal gaze dynamics to predict future
gaze locations with associated confidence estimates. Experimental evaluation on
a comprehensive VR dataset demonstrates that GazeProphet achieves a median
angular error of 3.83 degrees, outperforming traditional saliency-based
baselines by 24% while providing reliable confidence calibration. The approach
maintains consistent performance across different spatial regions and scene
types, enabling practical deployment in VR systems without additional hardware
requirements. Statistical analysis confirms the significance of improvements
across all evaluation metrics. These results show that software-only gaze
prediction can work for VR foveated rendering, making this performance boost
more accessible to different VR platforms and apps.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式人脸视频编码（GFVC）虽然在码率扭曲性能上优异，但大型模型参数和高计算成本阻碍了其实际部署。

Method: 提出双模式优化框架：结构方面用更薄轻高效的层替换传统3x3卷积；操作方面采用两阶段适配性通道剪枝策略，包括训练时的软剪枝和训练后的硬剪枝。

Result: 实验结果显示，方法实现了90.4%的参数减少和88.9%的计算节省，同时在感知质量指标上超过最先进的VVC视频编码标准。

Conclusion: 该方法有望在资源受限环境（如移动边缘设备）中实现高效的GFVC部署。

Abstract: Generative Face Video Coding (GFVC) achieves superior rate-distortion
performance by leveraging the strong inference capabilities of deep generative
models. However, its practical deployment is hindered by large model parameters
and high computational costs. To address this, we propose a lightweight GFVC
framework that introduces dual-mode optimization -- combining architectural
redesign and operational refinement -- to reduce complexity whilst preserving
reconstruction quality. Architecturally, we replace traditional 3 x 3
convolutions with slimmer and more efficient layers, reducing complexity
without compromising feature expressiveness. Operationally, we develop a
two-stage adaptive channel pruning strategy: (1) soft pruning during training
identifies redundant channels via learnable thresholds, and (2) hard pruning
permanently eliminates these channels post-training using a derived mask. This
dual-phase approach ensures both training stability and inference efficiency.
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed lightweight dual-mode
optimization for GFVC can achieve 90.4% parameter reduction and 88.9%
computation saving compared to the baseline, whilst achieving superior
performance compared to state-of-the-art video coding standard Versatile Video
Coding (VVC) in terms of perceptual-level quality metrics. As such, the
proposed method is expected to enable efficient GFVC deployment in
resource-constrained environments such as mobile edge devices.

Conclusion: 这种神经元样编码概念具有强大的发展潜力，有助于克服神经形态计算的当前限制，促进SNN的更广泛应用。

Abstract: In recent years, neuromorphic computing and spiking neural networks (SNNs)
have ad-vanced rapidly through integration with deep learning. However, the
performance of SNNs still lags behind that of convolutional neural networks
(CNNs), primarily due to the limited information capacity of spike-based data.
Although some studies have attempted to improve SNN performance by training
them with non-spiking inputs such as static images, this approach deviates from
the original intent of neuromorphic computing, which emphasizes spike-based
information processing. To address this issue, we propose a Neuron-like
Encoding method that generates spike data based on the intrinsic operational
principles and functions of biological neurons. This method is further enhanced
by the incorporation of an artificial pho-toreceptor layer, enabling spike data
to carry both color and luminance information, thereby forming a complete
visual spike signal. Experimental results using the Integrate-and-Fire neuron
model demonstrate that this biologically inspired approach effectively
increases the information content of spike signals and improves SNN
performance, all while adhering to neuromorphic principles. We believe this
concept holds strong potential for future development and may contribute to
overcoming current limitations in neuro-morphic computing, facilitating broader
applications of SNNs.

Motivation: 现有的视觉语言模型在少样本异常分割中的跨类别泛化能力严重依赖于已知异常样本的先验知识，需要一种无需重新训练就能检测未见类别异常的方法

Method: 包含三个核心组件：字典构建（用正常参考图像特征模拟字典）、字典查找（通过稀疏查找策略检索查询特征，无法检索的视为异常）、查询判别正则化（通过对比查询约束和文本对齐约束增强异常判别能力）

Result: 在7个工业和医疗数据集上的大量实验表明，DictAS持续优于最先进的少样本异常分割方法

Conclusion: 该方法通过自监督字典查找机制实现了对未见类别的有效异常检测，无需重新训练，展现了优异的泛化性能

Abstract: Recent vision-language models (e.g., CLIP) have demonstrated remarkable
class-generalizable ability to unseen classes in few-shot anomaly segmentation
(FSAS), leveraging supervised prompt learning or fine-tuning on seen classes.
However, their cross-category generalization largely depends on prior knowledge
of real seen anomaly samples. In this paper, we propose a novel framework,
namely DictAS, which enables a unified model to detect visual anomalies in
unseen object categories without any retraining on the target data, only
employing a few normal reference images as visual prompts. The insight behind
DictAS is to transfer dictionary lookup capabilities to the FSAS task for
unseen classes via self-supervised learning, instead of merely memorizing the
normal and abnormal feature patterns from the training set. Specifically,
DictAS mainly consists of three components: (1) **Dictionary Construction** -
to simulate the index and content of a real dictionary using features from
normal reference images. (2) **Dictionary Lookup** - to retrieve queried region
features from the dictionary via a sparse lookup strategy. When a query feature
cannot be retrieved, it is classified as an anomaly. (3) **Query Discrimination
Regularization**- to enhance anomaly discrimination by making abnormal features
harder to retrieve from the dictionary. To achieve this, Contrastive Query
Constraint and Text Alignment Constraint are further proposed. Extensive
experiments on seven public industrial and medical datasets demonstrate that
DictAS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art FSAS methods.

Motivation: SMPLify虽然稳健但计算成本高，受其他领域用神经网络替代迭代优化的启发，希望开发更高效的逆运动学求解方法。

Method: 提出时序采样策略构建初始化-目标对，采用以人为中心的归一化方案和残差学习来缩小解空间，支持序列推理和插件式后处理。

Conclusion: Learnable SMPLify建立了一个实用简单的基线，在保持精度的同时大幅提升效率，具有良好的泛化能力和模型无关性。

Abstract: In 3D human pose and shape estimation, SMPLify remains a robust baseline that
solves inverse kinematics (IK) through iterative optimization. However, its
high computational cost limits its practicality. Recent advances across domains
have shown that replacing iterative optimization with data-driven neural
networks can achieve significant runtime improvements without sacrificing
accuracy. Motivated by this trend, we propose Learnable SMPLify, a neural
framework that replaces the iterative fitting process in SMPLify with a
single-pass regression model. The design of our framework targets two core
challenges in neural IK: data construction and generalization. To enable
effective training, we propose a temporal sampling strategy that constructs
initialization-target pairs from sequential frames. To improve generalization
across diverse motions and unseen poses, we propose a human-centric
normalization scheme and residual learning to narrow the solution space.
Learnable SMPLify supports both sequential inference and plug-in
post-processing to refine existing image-based estimators. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method establishes itself as a practical and
simple baseline: it achieves nearly 200x faster runtime compared to SMPLify,
generalizes well to unseen 3DPW and RICH, and operates in a model-agnostic
manner when used as a plug-in tool on LucidAction. The code is available at

Abstract: Video action analysis is a foundational technology within the realm of
intelligent video comprehension, particularly concerning its application in
Internet of Things(IoT). However, existing methodologies overlook feature
semantics in feature extraction and focus on optimizing action proposals, thus
these solutions are unsuitable for widespread adoption in high-performance IoT
applications due to the limitations in precision, such as autonomous driving,
which necessitate robust and scalable intelligent video analytics analysis. To
address this issue, we propose a novel generative attention-based model to
learn the relation of feature semantics. Specifically, by leveraging the
differences of actions' foreground and background, our model simultaneously
learns the frame- and segment-dependencies of temporal action feature
semantics, which takes advantage of feature semantics in the feature extraction
effectively. To evaluate the effectiveness of our model, we conduct extensive
experiments on two benchmark video task, action recognition and action
detection. In the context of action detection tasks, we substantiate the
superiority of our approach through comprehensive validation on widely
recognized datasets. Moreover, we extend the validation of the effectiveness of
our proposed method to a broader task, video action recognition. Our code is

Result: 在四个公开RVOS测试集上均达到了state-of-the-art的性能水平

Conclusion: 通过重新关注分割头设计和简化模型结构，成功提升了引用视频对象分割的准确性和效果。

Abstract: Referring Video Object Segmentation (RVOS) aims to segment specific objects
in a video according to textual descriptions. We observe that recent RVOS
approaches often place excessive emphasis on feature extraction and temporal
modeling, while relatively neglecting the design of the segmentation head. In
fact, there remains considerable room for improvement in segmentation head
design. To address this, we propose a Temporal-Conditional Referring Video
Object Segmentation model, which innovatively integrates existing segmentation
methods to effectively enhance boundary segmentation capability. Furthermore,
our model leverages a text-to-video diffusion model for feature extraction. On
top of this, we remove the traditional noise prediction module to avoid the
randomness of noise from degrading segmentation accuracy, thereby simplifying
the model while improving performance. Finally, to overcome the limited feature
extraction capability of the VAE, we design a Temporal Context Mask Refinement
(TCMR) module, which significantly improves segmentation quality without
introducing complex designs. We evaluate our method on four public RVOS
benchmarks, where it consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Result: 在ACDC数据集上评测，语义分割性能整体提升1.85%，夜间场景下提升4.62%

Conclusion: 混合方法能够有效提升自动驾驶系统在具有挑战性条件下的觉知稳健性

Abstract: Autonomous Driving (AD) systems exhibit markedly degraded performance under
adverse environmental conditions, such as low illumination and precipitation.
The underrepresentation of adverse conditions in AD datasets makes it
challenging to address this deficiency. To circumvent the prohibitive cost of
acquiring and annotating adverse weather data, we propose a novel Domain
Adaptation (DA) pipeline that transforms clear-weather images into fog, rain,
snow, and nighttime images. Here, we systematically develop and evaluate
several novel data-generation pipelines, including simulation-only, GAN-based,
and hybrid diffusion-GAN approaches, to synthesize photorealistic adverse
images from labelled clear images. We leverage an existing DA GAN, extend it to
support auxiliary inputs, and develop a novel training recipe that leverages
both simulated and real images. The simulated images facilitate exact
supervision by providing perfectly matched image pairs, while the real images
help bridge the simulation-to-real (sim2real) gap. We further introduce a
method to mitigate hallucinations and artifacts in Stable-Diffusion
Image-to-Image (img2img) outputs by blending them adaptively with their
progenitor images. We finetune downstream models on our synthetic data and
evaluate them on the Adverse Conditions Dataset with Correspondences (ACDC). We
achieve 1.85 percent overall improvement in semantic segmentation, and 4.62
percent on nighttime, demonstrating the efficacy of our hybrid method for
robust AD perception under challenging conditions.

*Jinyoung Park,Minseok Son,Changick Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MaMe是一种专门为基于状态空间模型(SSM)的视觉模型设计的token合并策略，通过利用状态转移参数Δ量化token重要性并保持序列信息流，在保持性能的同时显著提升计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 状态空间模型在计算机视觉中表现出强大能力，但计算效率仍需提升。虽然token减少是提高模型效率的有效方法，但将其应用于SSM时需要特别考虑其独特的序列建模能力。

Method: 提出MaMe策略，利用状态转移参数Δ作为信息量度量指标，并引入战略性token排列来保持序列信息流。该方法专门针对SSM模型的特性进行设计。

Result: 实验表明MaMe在微调模型和现成模型上都实现了优越的效率-性能权衡。即使在激进的token减少情况下，该方法仍保持鲁棒性，而现有方法会出现显著性能下降。在图像分类之外，还在视频和音频领域展现出强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: MaMe为各种SSM应用提供了一种有效的效率提升方法，通过专门针对SSM特性的token合并策略，在保持序列建模能力的同时显著提高了计算效率。

Abstract: State Space Models (SSMs) have emerged as powerful architectures in computer
vision, yet improving their computational efficiency remains crucial for
practical and scalable deployment.While token reduction serves as an effective
approach for model efficiency, applying it to SSMs requires careful
consideration of their unique sequential modeling capabilities.In this work, we
propose MaMe, a token-merging strategy tailored for SSM-based vision
models.MaMe addresses two key challenges: quantifying token importance and
preserving sequential properties. Our approach leverages the state transition
parameter $\mathbf{\Delta}$ as an informativeness measure and introduces
strategic token arrangements to preserve sequential information flow.Extensive
experiments demonstrate that MaMe achieves superior efficiency-performance
trade-offs for both fine-tuned and off-the-shelf models. Particularly, our
approach maintains robustness even under aggressive token reduction where
existing methods undergo significant performance degradation.Beyond image
classification, MaMe shows strong generalization capabilities across video and
audio domains, establishing an effective approach for enhancing efficiency in
diverse SSM applications.

Conclusion: 双重解耦设计有效解决了语义和几何先验知识的冲突问题，为3D语义场景完成任务提供了更优称的解决方案

Abstract: Camera-based 3D semantic scene completion (SSC) provides dense geometric and
semantic perception for autonomous driving and robotic navigation. However,
existing methods rely on a coupled encoder to deliver both semantic and
geometric priors, which forces the model to make a trade-off between
conflicting demands and limits its overall performance. To tackle these
challenges, we propose FoundationSSC, a novel framework that performs dual
decoupling at both the source and pathway levels. At the source level, we
introduce a foundation encoder that provides rich semantic feature priors for
the semantic branch and high-fidelity stereo cost volumes for the geometric
branch. At the pathway level, these priors are refined through specialised,
decoupled pathways, yielding superior semantic context and depth distributions.
Our dual-decoupling design produces disentangled and refined inputs, which are
then utilised by a hybrid view transformation to generate complementary 3D
features. Additionally, we introduce a novel Axis-Aware Fusion (AAF) module
that addresses the often-overlooked challenge of fusing these features by
anisotropically merging them into a unified representation. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the advantages of FoundationSSC, achieving simultaneous
improvements in both semantic and geometric metrics, surpassing prior bests by
+0.23 mIoU and +2.03 IoU on SemanticKITTI. Additionally, we achieve
state-of-the-art performance on SSCBench-KITTI-360, with 21.78 mIoU and 48.61
IoU. The code will be released upon acceptance.

Abstract: With the growing demand for short videos and personalized content, automated
Video Log (Vlog) generation has become a key direction in multimodal content
creation. Existing methods mostly rely on predefined scripts, lacking dynamism
and personal expression. Therefore, there is an urgent need for an automated
Vlog generation approach that enables effective multimodal collaboration and
high personalization. To this end, we propose PersonaVlog, an automated
multimodal stylized Vlog generation framework that can produce personalized
Vlogs featuring videos, background music, and inner monologue speech based on a
given theme and reference image. Specifically, we propose a multi-agent
collaboration framework based on Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). This
framework efficiently generates high-quality prompts for multimodal content
creation based on user input, thereby improving the efficiency and creativity
of the process. In addition, we incorporate a feedback and rollback mechanism
that leverages MLLMs to evaluate and provide feedback on generated results,
thereby enabling iterative self-correction of multimodal content. We also
propose ThemeVlogEval, a theme-based automated benchmarking framework that
provides standardized metrics and datasets for fair evaluation. Comprehensive
experiments demonstrate the significant advantages and potential of our
framework over several baselines, highlighting its effectiveness and great
potential for generating automated Vlogs.

Abstract: Face mask detection has become increasingly important recently, particularly
during the COVID-19 pandemic. Many face detection models have been developed in
smart entryways using IoT. However, there is a lack of IoT development on face
mask detection. This paper proposes a two-factor authentication system for
smart entryway access control using facial recognition and passcode
verification and an automation process to alert the owner and activate the
surveillance system when a stranger is detected and controls the system
remotely via Telegram on a Raspberry Pi platform. The system employs the Local
Binary Patterns Histograms for the full face recognition algorithm and modified
LBPH algorithm for occluded face detection. On average, the system achieved an
Accuracy of approximately 70%, a Precision of approximately 80%, and a Recall
of approximately 83.26% across all tested users. The results indicate that the
system is capable of conducting face recognition and mask detection, automating
the operation of the remote control to register users, locking or unlocking the
door, and notifying the owner. The sample participants highly accept it for
future use in the user acceptance test.

Motivation: 当前最先进的音频驱动说话头合成模型在人类多样性（种族、语言、年龄）方面缺乏泛化能力，这主要是由于现有训练数据在规模、质量和多样性方面的限制。

Method: 通过多阶段自动化流水线精心筛选运动稳定性、美学质量和面部细节，构建TalkVid数据集；同时创建TalkVid-Bench评估集，包含500个在关键人口统计和语言维度上平衡的剪辑片段。

Result: 在TalkVid上训练的模型优于在先前数据集上训练的模型，展现出更好的跨数据集泛化能力。TalkVid-Bench分析揭示了传统聚合指标掩盖的性能差异。

Conclusion: TalkVid数据集和TalkVid-Bench评估集为解决音频驱动说话头合成中的多样性泛化问题提供了重要资源，强调了在多样化数据集上进行训练和评估的必要性。

Abstract: Audio-driven talking head synthesis has achieved remarkable photorealism, yet
state-of-the-art (SOTA) models exhibit a critical failure: they lack
generalization to the full spectrum of human diversity in ethnicity, language,
and age groups. We argue that this generalization gap is a direct symptom of
limitations in existing training data, which lack the necessary scale, quality,
and diversity. To address this challenge, we introduce TalkVid, a new
large-scale, high-quality, and diverse dataset containing 1244 hours of video
from 7729 unique speakers. TalkVid is curated through a principled, multi-stage
automated pipeline that rigorously filters for motion stability, aesthetic
quality, and facial detail, and is validated against human judgments to ensure
its reliability. Furthermore, we construct and release TalkVid-Bench, a
stratified evaluation set of 500 clips meticulously balanced across key
demographic and linguistic axes. Our experiments demonstrate that a model
trained on TalkVid outperforms counterparts trained on previous datasets,
exhibiting superior cross-dataset generalization. Crucially, our analysis on
TalkVid-Bench reveals performance disparities across subgroups that are
obscured by traditional aggregate metrics, underscoring its necessity for
future research. Code and data can be found in

Result: 在标准数据集上的实验结果显示，该方法不仅高效而且在准确性上超过了之前的RGB基础方法

Conclusion: 该方法为仅使用RGB图像进行类别级物体始终估计提供了新的视角，具有强大的应用潜力

Abstract: While most current RGB-D-based category-level object pose estimation methods
achieve strong performance, they face significant challenges in scenes lacking
depth information. In this paper, we propose a novel category-level object pose
estimation approach that relies solely on RGB images. This method enables
accurate pose estimation in real-world scenarios without the need for depth
data. Specifically, we design a transformer-based neural network for
category-level object pose estimation, where the transformer is employed to
predict and fuse the geometric features of the target object. To ensure that
these predicted geometric features faithfully capture the object's geometry, we
introduce a geometric feature-guided algorithm, which enhances the network's
ability to effectively represent the object's geometric information. Finally,
we utilize the RANSAC-PnP algorithm to compute the object's pose, addressing
the challenges associated with variable object scales in pose estimation.
Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our approach is not
only highly efficient but also achieves superior accuracy compared to previous
RGB-based methods. These promising results offer a new perspective for
advancing category-level object pose estimation using RGB images.

Motivation: 扩散模型在条件生成任务中对引导权重选择高度敏感，存在训练-推理差距，这影响了生成样本的质量和稳定性。

Method: 提出DiffIER优化框架，在推理阶段通过迭代误差最小化来减少累积误差，采用即插即用的优化方法在每个推理步骤进行误差优化。

Result: 实验表明该方法在条件生成任务中优于基线方法，在文本到图像生成、图像超分辨率和文本到语音生成等多个领域都取得了成功。

Conclusion: DiffIER方法有效缓解了训练-推理差距问题，提高了生成质量，具有广泛的适用性和应用潜力。

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in generating
high-quality samples and enhancing performance across diverse domains through
Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG). However, the quality of generated samples is
highly sensitive to the selection of the guidance weight. In this work, we
identify a critical ``training-inference gap'' and we argue that it is the
presence of this gap that undermines the performance of conditional generation
and renders outputs highly sensitive to the guidance weight. We quantify this
gap by measuring the accumulated error during the inference stage and establish
a correlation between the selection of guidance weight and minimizing this gap.
Furthermore, to mitigate this gap, we propose DiffIER, an optimization-based
method for high-quality generation. We demonstrate that the accumulated error
can be effectively reduced by an iterative error minimization at each step
during inference. By introducing this novel plug-and-play optimization
framework, we enable the optimization of errors at every single inference step
and enhance generation quality. Empirical results demonstrate that our proposed
method outperforms baseline approaches in conditional generation tasks.
Furthermore, the method achieves consistent success in text-to-image
generation, image super-resolution, and text-to-speech generation, underscoring
its versatility and potential for broad applications in future research.

Method: 两阶段训练流程：第一阶段利用大规模无配对图像训练无掩码定位模型，第二阶段用少量配对图像微调以保持物品外观一致性。

Result: 在包含12类可穿戴物品的综合基准测试中，OmniTry在物品定位和ID保持方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: OmniTry提供了一个统一的虚拟试穿解决方案，能够处理多种可穿戴物品，且对配对数据需求较低，具有更好的实用性和性能。

Abstract: Virtual Try-ON (VTON) is a practical and widely-applied task, for which most
of existing works focus on clothes. This paper presents OmniTry, a unified
framework that extends VTON beyond garment to encompass any wearable objects,
e.g., jewelries and accessories, with mask-free setting for more practical
application. When extending to various types of objects, data curation is
challenging for obtaining paired images, i.e., the object image and the
corresponding try-on result. To tackle this problem, we propose a two-staged
pipeline: For the first stage, we leverage large-scale unpaired images, i.e.,
portraits with any wearable items, to train the model for mask-free
localization. Specifically, we repurpose the inpainting model to automatically
draw objects in suitable positions given an empty mask. For the second stage,
the model is further fine-tuned with paired images to transfer the consistency
of object appearance. We observed that the model after the first stage shows
quick convergence even with few paired samples. OmniTry is evaluated on a
comprehensive benchmark consisting of 12 common classes of wearable objects,
with both in-shop and in-the-wild images. Experimental results suggest that
OmniTry shows better performance on both object localization and
ID-preservation compared with existing methods. The code, model weights, and
evaluation benchmark of OmniTry will be made publicly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法存在局限性：基于分割的方法在矢量化后处理中难以保持拓扑保真度；图增长方法计算成本高；图生成方法限制了顶点的动态插入。需要一种既能保持高效推理又能实现动态顶点插入的方法。

Method: 将任务解耦为四个步骤：候选顶点检测、相邻顶点预测、初始图构建和图扩展。这种架构创新允许动态顶点（边）插入，同时保持快速推理速度。

Result: 在CityScale和SpaceNet基准测试中达到最先进性能。在CityScale上比之前的SOTA方法RNGDet++提升了4.62 APLS和10.18 IoU，同时速度提高了约10倍。

Conclusion: DeH4R成功解决了道路网络提取中的关键挑战，实现了拓扑保真度和计算效率的平衡，为地理空间计算机视觉领域提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: The automated extraction of complete and precise road network graphs from
remote sensing imagery remains a critical challenge in geospatial computer
vision. Segmentation-based approaches, while effective in pixel-level
recognition, struggle to maintain topology fidelity after vectorization
postprocessing. Graph-growing methods build more topologically faithful graphs
but suffer from computationally prohibitive iterative ROI cropping.
Graph-generating methods first predict global static candidate road network
vertices, and then infer possible edges between vertices. They achieve fast
topology-aware inference, but limits the dynamic insertion of vertices. To
address these challenges, we propose DeH4R, a novel hybrid model that combines
graph-generating efficiency and graph-growing dynamics. This is achieved by
decoupling the task into candidate vertex detection, adjacent vertex
prediction, initial graph contruction, and graph expansion. This architectural
innovation enables dynamic vertex (edge) insertions while retaining fast
inference speed and enhancing both topology fidelity and spatial consistency.
Comprehensive evaluations on CityScale and SpaceNet benchmarks demonstrate
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. DeH4R outperforms the prior SOTA
graph-growing method RNGDet++ by 4.62 APLS and 10.18 IoU on CityScale, while
being approximately 10 $\times$ faster. The code will be made publicly
available at https://github.com/7777777FAN/DeH4R.

Abstract: The aspiration for artificial general intelligence, fueled by the rapid
progress of multimodal models, demands human-comparable performance across
diverse environments. We propose HumanPCR, an evaluation suite for probing
MLLMs' capacity about human-related visual contexts across three hierarchical
levels: Perception, Comprehension, and Reasoning (denoted by Human-P, Human-C,
and Human-R, respectively). Human-P and Human-C feature over 6,000
human-verified multiple choice questions, assessing massive tasks of 9
dimensions, including but not limited to essential skills frequently overlooked
by existing benchmarks. Human-R offers a challenging manually curated video
reasoning test that requires integrating multiple visual evidences, proactively
extracting context beyond question cues, and applying human-like expertise.
Each question includes human-annotated Chain-of-Thought (CoT) rationales with
key visual evidence to support further research. Extensive evaluations on over
30 state-of-the-art models exhibit significant challenges in human-centric
visual understanding, particularly in tasks involving detailed space
perception, temporal understanding, and mind modeling. Moreover, analysis of
Human-R reveals the struggle of models in extracting essential proactive visual
evidence from diverse human scenes and their faulty reliance on query-guided
retrieval. Even with advanced techniques like scaling visual contexts and
test-time thinking yield only limited benefits. We hope HumanPCR and our
findings will advance the development, evaluation, and human-centric
application of multimodal models.

Conclusion: DCMamba框架通过多角度增强多样性，充分发挥了Mamba模型在半监督医学图像分割中的潜力，为解决标记数据缺乏问题提供了有效方案

Abstract: Acquiring high-quality annotated data for medical image segmentation is
tedious and costly. Semi-supervised segmentation techniques alleviate this
burden by leveraging unlabeled data to generate pseudo labels. Recently,
advanced state space models, represented by Mamba, have shown efficient
handling of long-range dependencies. This drives us to explore their potential
in semi-supervised medical image segmentation. In this paper, we propose a
novel Diversity-enhanced Collaborative Mamba framework (namely DCMamba) for
semi-supervised medical image segmentation, which explores and utilizes the
diversity from data, network, and feature perspectives. Firstly, from the data
perspective, we develop patch-level weak-strong mixing augmentation with
Mamba's scanning modeling characteristics. Moreover, from the network
perspective, we introduce a diverse-scan collaboration module, which could
benefit from the prediction discrepancies arising from different scanning
directions. Furthermore, from the feature perspective, we adopt an
uncertainty-weighted contrastive learning mechanism to enhance the diversity of
feature representation. Experiments demonstrate that our DCMamba significantly
outperforms other semi-supervised medical image segmentation methods, e.g.,
yielding the latest SSM-based method by 6.69% on the Synapse dataset with 20%
labeled data.

Abstract: Every day, a large amount of educational content is uploaded online across
different areas, including agriculture and gardening. When these videos or
materials are grouped meaningfully, they can make learning easier and more
effective. One promising way to organize and enrich such content is through the
Metaverse, which allows users to explore educational experiences in an

Metaverse scenarios and finding those matching users' interests remains a
challenging task. A first step in this direction has been done recently, but
existing datasets are small and not sufficient for training advanced models. In
this work, we make two main contributions: first, we introduce a new dataset
containing 457 agricultural-themed virtual museums (AgriMuseums), each enriched
with textual descriptions; and second, we propose a hierarchical
vision-language model to represent and retrieve relevant AgriMuseums using
natural language queries. In our experimental setting, the proposed method
achieves up to about 62\% R@1 and 78\% MRR, confirming its effectiveness, and
it also leads to improvements on existing benchmarks by up to 6\% R@1 and 11\%

Result: 在标准全局图像描述任务和细粒度视觉问答任务中，IPGA在黑盒环境下始终优于现有方法，并成功迁移到多个商业VLM（Google Gemini和OpenAI GPT）。

Conclusion: IPGA通过利用投影器中间阶段进行细粒度攻击，显著提升了对抗攻击的精确性和可迁移性，为VLM安全评估提供了更有效的工具。

Abstract: Targeted adversarial attacks are essential for proactively identifying
security flaws in Vision-Language Models before real-world deployment. However,
current methods perturb images to maximize global similarity with the target
text or reference image at the encoder level, collapsing rich visual semantics
into a single global vector. This limits attack granularity, hindering
fine-grained manipulations such as modifying a car while preserving its
background. Furthermore, these methods largely overlook the projector module, a
critical semantic bridge between the visual encoder and the language model in
VLMs, thereby failing to disrupt the full vision-language alignment pipeline
within VLMs and limiting attack effectiveness. To address these issues, we
propose the Intermediate Projector Guided Attack (IPGA), the first method to
attack using the intermediate stage of the projector module, specifically the
widely adopted Q-Former, which transforms global image embeddings into
fine-grained visual features. This enables more precise control over
adversarial perturbations by operating on semantically meaningful visual tokens
rather than a single global representation. Specifically, IPGA leverages the
Q-Former pretrained solely on the first vision-language alignment stage,
without LLM fine-tuning, which improves both attack effectiveness and
transferability across diverse VLMs. Furthermore, we propose Residual Query
Alignment (RQA) to preserve unrelated visual content, thereby yielding more
controlled and precise adversarial manipulations. Extensive experiments show
that our attack method consistently outperforms existing methods in both
standard global image captioning tasks and fine-grained visual
question-answering tasks in black-box environment. Additionally, IPGA
successfully transfers to multiple commercial VLMs, including Google Gemini and
OpenAI GPT.

*Yeji Park,Minyoung Lee,Sanghyuk Chun,Junsuk Choe*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FOCUS是一种无需训练的解码策略，通过顺序掩码图像来缓解多图像输入时的信息泄漏问题，显著提升大视觉语言模型在多图像任务上的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型在单图像任务上表现优异，但在处理多图像输入时性能显著下降，因为不同图像的视觉线索在模型输出中相互干扰，出现跨图像信息泄漏现象。

Method: 提出FOCUS解码策略：1）顺序将所有图像除一张外都掩码为随机噪声，使模型专注于单张干净图像；2）对所有目标图像重复此过程获得部分掩码上下文下的logits；3）聚合logits并使用纯噪声参考输入进行对比精炼，抑制信息泄漏。

Result: FOCUS在四个多图像基准测试和多种LVLM模型家族上一致提升性能，证明其通用性和实用性。

Conclusion: FOCUS提供了一种无需额外训练或架构修改的通用实用解决方案，可有效增强多图像推理能力。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) demonstrate strong performance on
single-image tasks. However, we observe that their performance degrades
significantly when handling multi-image inputs. This occurs because visual cues
from different images become entangled in the model's output. We refer to this
phenomenon as cross-image information leakage. To address this issue, we
propose FOCUS, a training-free and architecture-agnostic decoding strategy that
mitigates cross-image information leakage during inference. FOCUS sequentially
masks all but one image with random noise, guiding the model to focus on the
single clean image. We repeat this process across all target images to obtain
logits under partially masked contexts. These logits are aggregated and then
contrastively refined using a noise-only reference input, which suppresses the
leakage and yields more accurate outputs. FOCUS consistently improves
performance across four multi-image benchmarks and diverse LVLM families. This
demonstrates that FOCUS offers a general and practical solution for enhancing
multi-image reasoning without additional training or architectural
modifications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MR6D是一个专为移动机器人设计的6D位姿估计数据集，针对工业环境中大尺寸物体、远距离视角和复杂遮挡等挑战，填补了现有数据集在移动机器人应用中的空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有6D位姿估计数据集主要关注机械臂操作的小型家用物体，无法满足移动机器人面对的大尺寸物体、远距离感知、严重自遮挡和多样化视角等工业环境需求。

Method: 构建包含92个真实场景、16个独特物体的MR6D数据集，涵盖静态和动态交互场景，专门捕捉移动平台特有的远距离视角、多样化物体配置、大尺寸物体和复杂遮挡模式。

Result: 初步实验显示当前6D位姿估计方法在这些场景下表现不佳，2D分割成为另一个主要障碍，验证了该数据集对移动机器人应用的重要性。

Conclusion: MR6D为开发和评估面向移动机器人需求的位姿估计方法奠定了基础，填补了工业环境中移动机器人6D位姿估计数据集的空白。

Abstract: Existing 6D pose estimation datasets primarily focus on small household
objects typically handled by robot arm manipulators, limiting their relevance
to mobile robotics. Mobile platforms often operate without manipulators,
interact with larger objects, and face challenges such as long-range
perception, heavy self-occlusion, and diverse camera perspectives. While recent
models generalize well to unseen objects, evaluations remain confined to
household-like settings that overlook these factors. We introduce MR6D, a
dataset designed for 6D pose estimation for mobile robots in industrial
environments. It includes 92 real-world scenes featuring 16 unique objects
across static and dynamic interactions. MR6D captures the challenges specific
to mobile platforms, including distant viewpoints, varied object
configurations, larger object sizes, and complex occlusion/self-occlusion
patterns. Initial experiments reveal that current 6D pipelines underperform in
these settings, with 2D segmentation being another hurdle. MR6D establishes a
foundation for developing and evaluating pose estimation methods tailored to
the demands of mobile robotics. The dataset is available at

Motivation: 当前的单相机Shape-from-Template(SfT)方法在医学成像和手持相机注册等应用中有限制，多相机系统为扩展SfT的应用范围提供了新机会。

Method: 提出三种方法：1)关键点位于知道三维点的方向向量上；2)关键点位于未知三维点但方向知道的向量上；3)结合边缘信息的方法。使用广义相机模型和投凸规划技术。

Result: 在各种合成和实际数据上验证了方法的准确性，显示出多视角相互约束对提高重建质量的重要作用。

Conclusion: 这是首批解决广义相机SfT问题的方法，为多相机系统下的非粗粗形状注册开启了新方向，在医学形态重建等领域具有应用潜力。

Abstract: This article presents a new method for non-rigidly registering a 3D shape to
2D keypoints observed by a constellation of multiple cameras. Non-rigid
registration of a 3D shape to observed 2D keypoints, i.e., Shape-from-Template
(SfT), has been widely studied using single images, but SfT with information
from multiple-cameras jointly opens new directions for extending the scope of
known use-cases such as 3D shape registration in medical imaging and
registration from hand-held cameras, to name a few. We represent such
multi-camera setup with the generalised camera model; therefore any collection
of perspective or orthographic cameras observing any deforming object can be
registered. We propose multiple approaches for such SfT: the first approach
where the corresponded keypoints lie on a direction vector from a known 3D
point in space, the second approach where the corresponded keypoints lie on a
direction vector from an unknown 3D point in space but with known orientation
w.r.t some local reference frame, and a third approach where, apart from
correspondences, the silhouette of the imaged object is also known. Together,
these form the first set of solutions to the SfT problem with generalised
cameras. The key idea behind SfT with generalised camera is the improved
reconstruction accuracy from estimating deformed shape while utilising the
additional information from the mutual constraints between multiple views of a
deformed object. The correspondence-based approaches are solved with convex
programming while the silhouette-based approach is an iterative refinement of
the results from the convex solutions. We demonstrate the accuracy of our
proposed methods on many synthetic and real data

*Jiajing Lin,Shu Jiang,Qingyuan Zeng,Zhenzhong Wang,Min Jiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VisionLaw是一个双层优化框架，通过LLM驱动的解耦本构演化策略和视觉引导的本构评估机制，从视觉观察中推断可解释的内在动力学表达式，解决了现有方法在泛化性和可解释性方面的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法推断物体内在动力学存在两大挑战：一是依赖手动定义的本构先验，难以泛化到复杂场景；二是使用神经网络建模，可解释性差且泛化能力有限。需要一种能够从视觉观察中推断可解释内在动力学的方法。

Method: 提出双层优化框架：上层使用LLM作为物理专家生成和修订本构定律，通过解耦机制降低搜索复杂度；下层通过视觉模拟评估生成的本构定律与底层内在动力学的一致性，指导上层演化。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的实验表明，VisionLaw能够有效从视觉观察中推断可解释的内在动力学，显著优于现有最先进方法，并在新场景的交互模拟中表现出强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: VisionLaw框架成功解决了内在动力学推断中的泛化性和可解释性问题，通过结合LLM的物理知识和视觉模拟验证，实现了从视觉观察到可解释物理定律的有效推断。

Abstract: The intrinsic dynamics of an object governs its physical behavior in the real
world, playing a critical role in enabling physically plausible interactive
simulation with 3D assets. Existing methods have attempted to infer the
intrinsic dynamics of objects from visual observations, but generally face two
major challenges: one line of work relies on manually defined constitutive
priors, making it difficult to generalize to complex scenarios; the other
models intrinsic dynamics using neural networks, resulting in limited
interpretability and poor generalization. To address these challenges, we
propose VisionLaw, a bilevel optimization framework that infers interpretable
expressions of intrinsic dynamics from visual observations. At the upper level,
we introduce an LLMs-driven decoupled constitutive evolution strategy, where
LLMs are prompted as a knowledgeable physics expert to generate and revise
constitutive laws, with a built-in decoupling mechanism that substantially
reduces the search complexity of LLMs. At the lower level, we introduce a
vision-guided constitutive evaluation mechanism, which utilizes visual
simulation to evaluate the consistency between the generated constitutive law
and the underlying intrinsic dynamics, thereby guiding the upper-level
evolution. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate
that VisionLaw can effectively infer interpretable intrinsic dynamics from
visual observations. It significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art
methods and exhibits strong generalization for interactive simulation in novel
scenarios.

Motivation: 提高乳腺癌超声分割的准确性和可解释性，通过整合临床文本信息来增强模型的可信度和透明度，为计算机辅助诊断提供更可靠的解决方案。

Method: 使用双分支视觉编码器（ViT+Swin Transformer）进行病灶分割，结合BioClinicalBERT编码临床报告文本，通过跨模态注意力融合视觉和文本特征，同时生成分割掩码、不确定性图和诊断依据。

Result: 在BUS-BRA数据集上达到Dice 99%和IoU 95%，超越U-Net、ViT和Swin等基线模型，多模态对齐得分85%，置信度校准误差3.2%。

Conclusion: Med-CTX通过整合临床文本信息显著提升了分割性能和可解释性，为可信赖的多模态医学架构设立了新标准，证明了临床文本在医学图像分析中的关键作用。

Abstract: We introduce Med-CTX, a fully transformer based multimodal framework for
explainable breast cancer ultrasound segmentation. We integrate clinical
radiology reports to boost both performance and interpretability. Med-CTX
achieves exact lesion delineation by using a dual-branch visual encoder that
combines ViT and Swin transformers, as well as uncertainty aware fusion.
Clinical language structured with BI-RADS semantics is encoded by
BioClinicalBERT and combined with visual features utilising cross-modal
attention, allowing the model to provide clinically grounded, model generated
explanations. Our methodology generates segmentation masks, uncertainty maps,
and diagnostic rationales all at once, increasing confidence and transparency
in computer assisted diagnosis. On the BUS-BRA dataset, Med-CTX achieves a Dice
score of 99% and an IoU of 95%, beating existing baselines U-Net, ViT, and
Swin. Clinical text plays a key role in segmentation accuracy and explanation
quality, as evidenced by ablation studies that show a -5.4% decline in Dice
score and -31% in CIDEr. Med-CTX achieves good multimodal alignment (CLIP
score: 85%) and increased confi dence calibration (ECE: 3.2%), setting a new

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了时间步压缩攻击（TCA）框架，通过时间步级利用反向传播和对抗膜电位重用技术，在保持攻击成功率的同时显著减少了攻击延迟，解决了现有攻击方法在脉冲神经网络中实时应用的急需问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的梯度基于对抗攻击方法在脉冲神经网络（SNNs）中存在显著的攻击延迟问题，这主要是因为它们直接扩展自传统神经网络的框架，没有充分利用SNN的关键特性，导致多时间步处理耗时过长，不适用于实际实时应用。

Method: 论文提出了时间步压缩攻击（TCA）框架，包含两个核心组件：1）时间步级利用反向传播（TLBP），基于发现生成干扰的全局时间信息并非攻击成功的关键因素，允许按每个时间步进行评估并提前停止；2）对抗膜电位重用（A-MPR），动机是观察到初始时间步效率低下地用于累积膜电位，这个热身阶段可以预先计算并重用。

Result: 在VGG-11和ResNet-17模型上使用CIFAR-10/100和CIFAR10-DVS数据集进行实验，结果显示TCA在白盒和黑盒设置下，相比当前最优方法分别减少了围绕56.6%和57.1%的攻击延迟，同时保持了相似的攻击成功率。

Conclusion: TCA框架通过充分利用SNN的特有性质，有效解决了现有对抗攻击方法在SNN中存在的高延迟问题，为实时应用提供了可行的解决方案，在维持攻击效果的同时显著提升了攻击效率。

Abstract: State-of-the-art (SOTA) gradient-based adversarial attacks on spiking neural
networks (SNNs), which largely rely on extending FGSM and PGD frameworks, face
a critical limitation: substantial attack latency from multi-timestep
processing, rendering them infeasible for practical real-time applications.
This inefficiency stems from their design as direct extensions of ANN
paradigms, which fail to exploit key SNN properties. In this paper, we propose
the timestep-compressed attack (TCA), a novel framework that significantly
reduces attack latency. TCA introduces two components founded on key insights
into SNN behavior. First, timestep-level backpropagation (TLBP) is based on our
finding that global temporal information in backpropagation to generate
perturbations is not critical for an attack's success, enabling per-timestep
evaluation for early stopping. Second, adversarial membrane potential reuse
(A-MPR) is motivated by the observation that initial timesteps are
inefficiently spent accumulating membrane potential, a warm-up phase that can
be pre-calculated and reused. Our experiments on VGG-11 and ResNet-17 with the
CIFAR-10/100 and CIFAR10-DVS datasets show that TCA significantly reduces the
required attack latency by up to 56.6% and 57.1% compared to SOTA methods in
white-box and black-box settings, respectively, while maintaining a comparable
attack success rate.

Motivation: 城市树木生物多样性对气候适应和生态稳定关键，但现场调查成本高、耗时，而有监督的AI方法需要标签数据且穿越区域性能差

Method: 无监督聚类框架，结合街道级图像的视觉嵌入和空间植装模式，在无标签的情况下估算生物多样性

Result: 在八个北美城市的应用显示，该方法能高保真地恢复属级多样性模式，对Shannon和Simpson指数获得低Wasserstein距离，保持空间自相关性

Conclusion: 该可扩展、细粒度方法能够为缺乏详细调查的城市提供生物多样性地图制作，支持连续、低成本的监测，促进城市绿化公平分配和适应性生态管理

Abstract: Urban tree biodiversity is critical for climate resilience, ecological
stability, and livability in cities, yet most municipalities lack detailed
knowledge of their canopies. Field-based inventories provide reliable estimates
of Shannon and Simpson diversity but are costly and time-consuming, while
supervised AI methods require labeled data that often fail to generalize across
regions. We introduce an unsupervised clustering framework that integrates
visual embeddings from street-level imagery with spatial planting patterns to
estimate biodiversity without labels. Applied to eight North American cities,
the method recovers genus-level diversity patterns with high fidelity,
achieving low Wasserstein distances to ground truth for Shannon and Simpson
indices and preserving spatial autocorrelation. This scalable, fine-grained
approach enables biodiversity mapping in cities lacking detailed inventories
and offers a pathway for continuous, low-cost monitoring to support equitable
access to greenery and adaptive management of urban ecosystems.

Conclusion: SA3方案通过高效的对齐机制和识别策略，成功解决了跨域智能交通检测的挑战，为该领域提供了可靠的解决方案

Abstract: Achieving top-notch performance in Intelligent Transportation detection is a
critical research area. However, many challenges still need to be addressed
when it comes to detecting in a cross-domain scenario. In this paper, we
propose a Self-Aware Adaptive Alignment (SA3), by leveraging an efficient
alignment mechanism and recognition strategy. Our proposed method employs a
specified attention-based alignment module trained on source and target domain
datasets to guide the image-level features alignment process, enabling the
local-global adaptive alignment between the source domain and target domain.
Features from both domains, whose channel importance is re-weighted, are fed
into the region proposal network, which facilitates the acquisition of salient
region features. Also, we introduce an instance-to-image level alignment module
specific to the target domain to adaptively mitigate the domain gap. To
evaluate the proposed method, extensive experiments have been conducted on
popular cross-domain object detection benchmarks. Experimental results show
that SA3 achieves superior results to the previous state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: State-of-the-art text-to-image models produce visually impressive results but
often struggle with precise alignment to text prompts, leading to missing
critical elements or unintended blending of distinct concepts. We propose a
novel approach that learns a high-success-rate distribution conditioned on a
target prompt, ensuring that generated images faithfully reflect the
corresponding prompts. Our method explicitly models the signal component during
the denoising process, offering fine-grained control that mitigates
over-optimization and out-of-distribution artifacts. Moreover, our framework is
training-free and seamlessly integrates with both existing diffusion and flow
matching architectures. It also supports additional conditioning modalities --
such as bounding boxes -- for enhanced spatial alignment. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our approach outperforms current state-of-the-art methods. The

costly in terms of time and resources. The system developed here introduces and
evaluates a multi-agent artificial intelligence (AI) system, designed to

architecture that orchestrates a team of specialized AI agents which, in this
specific case, are limited to five: a lithologist, a pathologist, an

Motivation: 现有增量学习评估多依赖简化合成基准，无法反映真实世界性能，需要构建更现实的基准来评估增量学习方法在真实场景中的表现

Method: 构建了两个现实增量目标检测基准：D-RICO（固定类别集但存在域偏移）和EC-RICO（每步增加新域和新类别），基于14个多样化数据集，涵盖真实和合成域、不同条件、相机传感器、视角和标注策略

Result: 所有增量学习方法在适应性和知识保留方面都表现不佳，回放少量先前数据已经超越所有方法，但独立训练数据仍然是最优的

Conclusion: 增量学习方法与独立训练之间存在性能差距，归因于蒸馏中的弱教师、单模型无法处理多样化任务以及可塑性不足等问题

Abstract: Incremental Learning (IL) trains models sequentially on new data without full
retraining, offering privacy, efficiency, and scalability. IL must balance
adaptability to new data with retention of old knowledge. However, evaluations
often rely on synthetic, simplified benchmarks, obscuring real-world IL
performance. To address this, we introduce two Realistic Incremental Object
Detection Benchmarks (RICO): Domain RICO (D-RICO) features domain shifts with a
fixed class set, and Expanding-Classes RICO (EC-RICO) integrates new domains
and classes per IL step. Built from 14 diverse datasets covering real and
synthetic domains, varying conditions (e.g., weather, time of day), camera
sensors, perspectives, and labeling policies, both benchmarks capture
challenges absent in existing evaluations. Our experiments show that all IL
methods underperform in adaptability and retention, while replaying a small
amount of previous data already outperforms all methods. However, individual
training on the data remains superior. We heuristically attribute this gap to
weak teachers in distillation, single models' inability to manage diverse
tasks, and insufficient plasticity. Our code will be made publicly available.

Conclusion: LCRReg提供了一种轻量级、架构无关的策略，无需密集概念监督即可有效提升模型鲁棒性，在医学影像分析中具有重要应用价值。

Abstract: Deep learning models in medical imaging often achieve strong in-distribution
performance but struggle to generalise under distribution shifts, frequently
relying on spurious correlations instead of clinically meaningful features. We
introduce LCRReg, a novel regularisation approach that leverages Latent Concept
Representations (LCRs) (e.g., Concept Activation Vectors (CAVs)) to guide
models toward semantically grounded representations. LCRReg requires no concept
labels in the main training set and instead uses a small auxiliary dataset to
synthesise high-quality, disentangled concept examples. We extract LCRs for
predefined relevant features, and incorporate a regularisation term that guides
a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to activate within latent subspaces
associated with those concepts. We evaluate LCRReg across synthetic and
real-world medical tasks. On a controlled toy dataset, it significantly
improves robustness to injected spurious correlations and remains effective
even in multi-concept and multiclass settings. On the diabetic retinopathy
binary classification task, LCRReg enhances performance under both synthetic
spurious perturbations and out-of-distribution (OOD) generalisation. Compared
to baselines, including multitask learning, linear probing, and post-hoc
concept-based models, LCRReg offers a lightweight, architecture-agnostic
strategy for improving model robustness without requiring dense concept
supervision. Code is available at the following link:

Abstract: The South Asian Smog refers to the recurring annual air pollution events
marked by high contaminant levels, reduced visibility, and significant
socio-economic impacts, primarily affecting the Indo-Gangetic Plains (IGP) from
November to February. Over the past decade, increased air pollution sources

component in calculating the Air Quality Index (AQI), reflects particulate
matter concentrations. This study forecasts aerosol events using Sentinel-5P
air constituent data (2019-2023) and a Convolutional Long-Short Term Memory
(ConvLSTM) neural network, which captures spatial and temporal correlations
more effectively than previous models. Using the Ultraviolet (UV) Aerosol Index
at 340-380 nm as the predictor, results show the Aerosol Index can be
forecasted at five-day intervals with a Mean Squared Error of ~0.0018, loss of
~0.3995, and Structural Similarity Index of ~0.74. While effective, the model
can be improved by integrating additional data and refining its architecture.

Abstract: Medical ultrasound image segmentation presents a formidable challenge in the
realm of computer vision. Traditional approaches rely on Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNNs) and Transformer-based methods to address the intricacies of
medical image segmentation. Nevertheless, inherent limitations persist, as
CNN-based methods tend to disregard long-range dependencies, while
Transformer-based methods may overlook local contextual information. To address
these deficiencies, we propose a novel Feature Aggregation Module (FAM)
designed to process two input features from the preceding layer. These features
are seamlessly directed into two branches of the Convolution and
Cross-Attention Parallel Module (CCAPM) to endow them with different roles in
each of the two branches to help establish a strong connection between the two
input features. This strategy enables our module to focus concurrently on both
long-range dependencies and local contextual information by judiciously merging
convolution operations with cross-attention mechanisms. Moreover, by
integrating FAM within our proposed Spatial-Channel Regulation Module (SCRM),
the ability to discern salient regions and informative features warranting
increased attention is enhanced. Furthermore, by incorporating the SCRM into
the encoder block of the UNet architecture, we introduce a novel framework
dubbed Spatial-Channel Regulation Network (SCRNet). The results of our
extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of SCRNet, which consistently
achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance compared to existing methods.

Abstract: While physics-grounded 3D motion synthesis has seen significant progress,
current methods face critical limitations. They typically rely on
pre-reconstructed 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) representations, while physics
integration depends on either inflexible, manually defined physical attributes
or unstable, optimization-heavy guidance from video models. To overcome these
challenges, we introduce PhysGM, a feed-forward framework that jointly predicts
a 3D Gaussian representation and its physical properties from a single image,
enabling immediate, physical simulation and high-fidelity 4D rendering. We
first establish a base model by jointly optimizing for Gaussian reconstruction
and probabilistic physics prediction. The model is then refined with physically
plausible reference videos to enhance both rendering fidelity and physics
prediction accuracy. We adopt the Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to align
its simulations with reference videos, circumventing Score Distillation
Sampling (SDS) optimization which needs back-propagating gradients through the
complex differentiable simulation and rasterization. To facilitate the
training, we introduce a new dataset PhysAssets of over 24,000 3D assets,
annotated with physical properties and corresponding guiding videos.
Experimental results demonstrate that our method effectively generates
high-fidelity 4D simulations from a single image in one minute. This represents
a significant speedup over prior works while delivering realistic rendering
results. Our project page is at:https://hihixiaolv.github.io/PhysGM.github.io/

Method: 提出双光照增强框架DIME-Net，核心是混合专家光照估计模块，通过稀疏门控机制自适应选择S曲线专家网络。结合Retinex理论，设计损伤恢复模块（包含光照感知交叉注意力和序列状态全局注意力机制），并构建混合光照数据集MixBL

Result: 实验结果表明，DIME-Net在合成和真实世界的低光和背光数据集上都取得了竞争性性能，无需任何重新训练

Conclusion: 该方法展示了在多样复杂光照条件下的泛化能力和实际多媒体应用潜力

Abstract: Image degradation caused by complex lighting conditions such as low-light and
backlit scenarios is commonly encountered in real-world environments,
significantly affecting image quality and downstream vision tasks. Most
existing methods focus on a single type of illumination degradation and lack
the ability to handle diverse lighting conditions in a unified manner. To
address this issue, we propose a dual-illumination enhancement framework called
DIME-Net. The core of our method is a Mixture-of-Experts illumination estimator
module, where a sparse gating mechanism adaptively selects suitable S-curve
expert networks based on the illumination characteristics of the input image.
By integrating Retinex theory, this module effectively performs enhancement
tailored to both low-light and backlit images. To further correct
illumination-induced artifacts and color distortions, we design a damage
restoration module equipped with Illumination-Aware Cross Attention and
Sequential-State Global Attention mechanisms. In addition, we construct a
hybrid illumination dataset, MixBL, by integrating existing datasets, allowing
our model to achieve robust illumination adaptability through a single training
process. Experimental results show that DIME-Net achieves competitive
performance on both synthetic and real-world low-light and backlit datasets
without any retraining. These results demonstrate its generalization ability
and potential for practical multimedia applications under diverse and complex
illumination conditions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前人脸图像质量评估方法主要依赖卷积神经网络，而Vision Transformer架构的潜力尚未充分探索，需要开发基于ViT的FIQA方法。

Method: 扩展标准ViT骨干网络，添加可学习的质量token与图像patch token拼接，通过全局自注意力聚合上下文信息，使用双头结构分别学习人脸表示和质量预测。

Result: 在多个具有挑战性的基准测试和不同FR模型上，ViT-FIQA始终达到顶级性能，证明了基于transformer架构的有效性。

Conclusion: ViT-FIQA展示了transformer架构在建模人脸图像效用方面的有效性，为未来FIQA研究提供了可扩展的基础。

Abstract: Face Image Quality Assessment (FIQA) aims to predict the utility of a face
image for face recognition (FR) systems. State-of-the-art FIQA methods mainly
rely on convolutional neural networks (CNNs), leaving the potential of Vision
Transformer (ViT) architectures underexplored. This work proposes ViT-FIQA, a
novel approach that extends standard ViT backbones, originally optimized for
FR, through a learnable quality token designed to predict a scalar utility
score for any given face image. The learnable quality token is concatenated
with the standard image patch tokens, and the whole sequence is processed via
global self-attention by the ViT encoders to aggregate contextual information
across all patches. At the output of the backbone, ViT-FIQA branches into two
heads: (1) the patch tokens are passed through a fully connected layer to learn
discriminative face representations via a margin-penalty softmax loss, and (2)
the quality token is fed into a regression head to learn to predict the face
sample's utility. Extensive experiments on challenging benchmarks and several
FR models, including both CNN- and ViT-based architectures, demonstrate that
ViT-FIQA consistently achieves top-tier performance. These results underscore
the effectiveness of transformer-based architectures in modeling face image
utility and highlight the potential of ViTs as a scalable foundation for future
FIQA research https://cutt.ly/irHlzXUC.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MLLMs在图像旋转识别任务上表现不佳，特别是无法可靠区分90°和270°旋转，揭示了多模态大语言模型在空间推理能力方面与人类感知存在显著差距


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究多模态大语言模型(MLLMs)能否准确识别输入图像的旋转方向(0°, 90°, 180°, 270°)，评估其视觉推理能力和空间关系理解能力

Method: 构建RotBench基准数据集(350张手动筛选的图像)，测试多个先进MLLMs模型，提供辅助信息(标题、深度图等)，使用思维链提示，尝试微调和投票机制

Result: 大多数模型能可靠识别0°图像，部分能识别180°图像，但都无法可靠区分90°和270°旋转。辅助信息和思维链提示只有微小改善，微调对90°/270°区分无效

Conclusion: MLLMs在旋转识别任务上存在显著能力缺陷，特别是在区分90°和270°旋转方面，表明其空间推理能力远不如人类感知

Abstract: We investigate to what extent Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) can
accurately identify the orientation of input images rotated 0{\deg}, 90{\deg},
180{\deg}, and 270{\deg}. This task demands robust visual reasoning
capabilities to detect rotational cues and contextualize spatial relationships
within images, regardless of their orientation. To evaluate MLLMs on these
abilities, we introduce RotBench -- a 350-image manually-filtered benchmark
comprising lifestyle, portrait, and landscape images. Despite the relatively
simple nature of this task, we show that several state-of-the-art open and
proprietary MLLMs, including GPT-5, o3, and Gemini-2.5-Pro, do not reliably
identify rotation in input images. Providing models with auxiliary information
-- including captions, depth maps, and more -- or using chain-of-thought
prompting offers only small and inconsistent improvements. Our results indicate
that most models are able to reliably identify right-side-up (0{\deg}) images,
while certain models are able to identify upside-down (180{\deg}) images. None
can reliably distinguish between 90{\deg} and 270{\deg}. Simultaneously showing
the image rotated in different orientations leads to moderate performance gains
for reasoning models, while a modified setup using voting improves the
performance of weaker models. We further show that fine-tuning does not improve
models' ability to distinguish 90{\deg} and 270{\deg} rotations, despite
substantially improving the identification of 180{\deg} images. Together, these
results reveal a significant gap between MLLMs' spatial reasoning capabilities
and human perception in identifying rotation.

Abstract: Depth estimation is a fundamental task for 3D scene understanding in
autonomous driving, robotics, and augmented reality. Existing depth datasets,
such as KITTI, nuScenes, and DDAD, have advanced the field but suffer from
limitations in diversity and scalability. As benchmark performance on these
datasets approaches saturation, there is an increasing need for a new
generation of large-scale, diverse, and cost-efficient datasets to support the
era of foundation models and multi-modal learning. To address these challenges,
we introduce a large-scale, diverse, frame-wise continuous dataset for depth
estimation in dynamic outdoor driving environments, comprising 20K video frames
to evaluate existing methods. Our lightweight acquisition pipeline ensures
broad scene coverage at low cost, while sparse yet statistically sufficient
ground truth enables robust training. Compared to existing datasets, ours
presents greater diversity in driving scenarios and lower depth density,
creating new challenges for generalization. Benchmark experiments with standard
monocular depth estimation models validate the dataset's utility and highlight
substantial performance gaps in challenging conditions, establishing a new
platform for advancing depth estimation research.

Abstract: Video action detection requires dense spatio-temporal annotations, which are
both challenging and expensive to obtain. However, real-world videos often vary
in difficulty and may not require the same level of annotation. This paper
analyzes the appropriate annotation types for each sample and their impact on
spatio-temporal video action detection. It focuses on two key aspects: 1) how
to obtain varying levels of annotation for videos, and 2) how to learn action
detection from different annotation types. The study explores video-level tags,
points, scribbles, bounding boxes, and pixel-level masks. First, a simple
active learning strategy is proposed to estimate the necessary annotation type
for each video. Then, a novel spatio-temporal 3D-superpixel approach is
introduced to generate pseudo-labels from these annotations, enabling effective
training. The approach is validated on UCF101-24 and JHMDB-21 datasets,
significantly cutting annotation costs with minimal performance loss.

Abstract: The design and analysis of pallet setups are essential for ensuring safety of

Abstract: Outside of urban hubs, autonomous cars and trucks have to master driving on
intercity highways. Safe, long-distance highway travel at speeds exceeding 100
km/h demands perception distances of at least 250 m, which is about five times
the 50-100m typically addressed in city driving, to allow sufficient planning
and braking margins. Increasing the perception ranges also allows to extend
autonomy from light two-ton passenger vehicles to large-scale forty-ton trucks,
which need a longer planning horizon due to their high inertia. However, most
existing perception approaches focus on shorter ranges and rely on Bird's Eye
View (BEV) representations, which incur quadratic increases in memory and
compute costs as distance grows. To overcome this limitation, we built on top
of a sparse representation and introduced an efficient 3D encoding of
multi-modal and temporal features, along with a novel self-supervised
pre-training scheme that enables large-scale learning from unlabeled
camera-LiDAR data. Our approach extends perception distances to 250 meters and
achieves an 26.6% improvement in mAP in object detection and a decrease of
30.5% in Chamfer Distance in LiDAR forecasting compared to existing methods,
reaching distances up to 250 meters. Project Page:

Conclusion: 该方法通过智能视角选择有效解决了在线3DGS模型构建中的完整性问题，为仅使用RGB帧的高质量三维重建提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: This study addresses the challenge of generating online 3D Gaussian Splatting
(3DGS) models from RGB-only frames. Previous studies have employed dense SLAM
techniques to estimate 3D scenes from keyframes for 3DGS model construction.
However, these methods are limited by their reliance solely on keyframes, which
are insufficient to capture an entire scene, resulting in incomplete
reconstructions. Moreover, building a generalizable model requires
incorporating frames from diverse viewpoints to achieve broader scene coverage.
However, online processing restricts the use of many frames or extensive
training iterations. Therefore, we propose a novel method for high-quality 3DGS
modeling that improves model completeness through adaptive view selection. By
analyzing reconstruction quality online, our approach selects optimal
non-keyframes for additional training. By integrating both keyframes and
selected non-keyframes, the method refines incomplete regions from diverse
viewpoints, significantly enhancing completeness. We also present a framework
that incorporates an online multi-view stereo approach, ensuring consistency in
3D information throughout the 3DGS modeling process. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art methods, delivering
exceptional performance in complex outdoor scenes.

Conclusion: Noisy Alignment通过显式抑制噪声成分，成功解决了现有数据投毒后门攻击方法的局限性，为对比学习的安全性研究提供了新的思路。

Abstract: Self-supervised contrastive learning (CL) effectively learns transferable
representations from unlabeled data containing images or image-text pairs but
suffers vulnerability to data poisoning backdoor attacks (DPCLs). An adversary
can inject poisoned images into pretraining datasets, causing compromised CL
encoders to exhibit targeted misbehavior in downstream tasks. Existing DPCLs,
however, achieve limited efficacy due to their dependence on fragile implicit
co-occurrence between backdoor and target object and inadequate suppression of
discriminative features in backdoored images. We propose Noisy Alignment (NA),
a DPCL method that explicitly suppresses noise components in poisoned images.
Inspired by powerful training-controllable CL attacks, we identify and extract
the critical objective of noisy alignment, adapting it effectively into
data-poisoning scenarios. Our method implements noisy alignment by
strategically manipulating contrastive learning's random cropping mechanism,
formulating this process as an image layout optimization problem with
theoretically derived optimal parameters. The resulting method is simple yet
effective, achieving state-of-the-art performance compared to existing DPCLs,
while maintaining clean-data accuracy. Furthermore, Noisy Alignment
demonstrates robustness against common backdoor defenses. Codes can be found at

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in video AIGC have ushered in a transformative era for
audio-driven human animation. However, conventional video dubbing techniques
remain constrained to mouth region editing, resulting in discordant facial
expressions and body gestures that compromise viewer immersion. To overcome
this limitation, we introduce sparse-frame video dubbing, a novel paradigm that
strategically preserves reference keyframes to maintain identity, iconic
gestures, and camera trajectories while enabling holistic, audio-synchronized
full-body motion editing. Through critical analysis, we identify why naive
image-to-video models fail in this task, particularly their inability to
achieve adaptive conditioning. Addressing this, we propose InfiniteTalk, a
streaming audio-driven generator designed for infinite-length long sequence
dubbing. This architecture leverages temporal context frames for seamless
inter-chunk transitions and incorporates a simple yet effective sampling
strategy that optimizes control strength via fine-grained reference frame
positioning. Comprehensive evaluations on HDTF, CelebV-HQ, and EMTD datasets
demonstrate state-of-the-art performance. Quantitative metrics confirm superior
visual realism, emotional coherence, and full-body motion synchronization.

TL;DR: DetailGen3D是一个专门用于增强生成3D形状几何细节的方法，通过潜在空间中的数据依赖流实现从粗糙到精细的转换，避免了大规模3D生成模型的计算开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代3D生成方法虽然能够从稀疏或单视图快速创建形状，但由于计算限制，其输出往往缺乏几何细节。需要一种专门的方法来增强这些生成3D形状的细节质量。

Method: 采用数据依赖流在潜在空间中建模粗糙到精细的转换，引入令牌匹配策略确保细化过程中的准确空间对应，精心设计训练数据以匹配合成粗糙形状的特征。

Result: 该方法能够有效增强各种3D生成和重建方法产生的形状，从单视图到稀疏多视图输入，实现了高保真几何细节合成，同时保持了训练效率。

Conclusion: DetailGen3D通过创新的潜在空间流建模和令牌匹配策略，成功解决了生成3D形状细节不足的问题，为3D生成领域提供了有效的细节增强解决方案。

Abstract: Modern 3D generation methods can rapidly create shapes from sparse or single
views, but their outputs often lack geometric detail due to computational
constraints. We present DetailGen3D, a generative approach specifically
designed to enhance these generated 3D shapes. Our key insight is to model the
coarse-to-fine transformation directly through data-dependent flows in latent
space, avoiding the computational overhead of large-scale 3D generative models.
We introduce a token matching strategy that ensures accurate spatial
correspondence during refinement, enabling local detail synthesis while
preserving global structure. By carefully designing our training data to match
the characteristics of synthesized coarse shapes, our method can effectively
enhance shapes produced by various 3D generation and reconstruction approaches,
from single-view to sparse multi-view inputs. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that DetailGen3D achieves high-fidelity geometric detail synthesis while
maintaining efficiency in training.

TL;DR: 首个为3D高斯拓扑的知识蓄粉框架，通过多老师模型指导轻量化学生模型，在保持渲染质量的同时大幅减少存储需求


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D高斯拓扑技术虽然在新视角合成方面表现出色，但需要大量的3D高斯元素来实现高保真度渲染，导致内存和存储成本过高

Method: 提出知识蓄粉框架，使用多种老师模型（包括普通3DGS、噪声增强版和dropout正则化版）输出聚合指导轻量化学生模型优化，并提出结构相似性损失来促进学生与老师模型间空间几何结构的一致性

Result: 通过多数据集的完整定量和定性评估，提出的Distilled-3DGS框架在渲染质量和存储效率方面都取得了有望的结果，较现有最先进方法更优

Conclusion: 该知识蓄粉框架为3D高斯拓扑技术提供了一种简单但有效的轻量化方案，在保持高质量渲染的同时显著减少了存储需求，具有实际应用价值

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has exhibited remarkable efficacy in novel view
synthesis (NVS). However, it suffers from a significant drawback: achieving
high-fidelity rendering typically necessitates a large number of 3D Gaussians,
resulting in substantial memory consumption and storage requirements. To
address this challenge, we propose the first knowledge distillation framework
for 3DGS, featuring various teacher models, including vanilla 3DGS,
noise-augmented variants, and dropout-regularized versions. The outputs of
these teachers are aggregated to guide the optimization of a lightweight
student model. To distill the hidden geometric structure, we propose a
structural similarity loss to boost the consistency of spatial geometric
distributions between the student and teacher model. Through comprehensive
quantitative and qualitative evaluations across diverse datasets, the proposed
Distilled-3DGS, a simple yet effective framework without bells and whistles,
achieves promising rendering results in both rendering quality and storage
efficiency compared to state-of-the-art methods. Project page:

Conclusion: 提出的数据集和模型能有效处理细粒度组合视频检索任务，通过密集修改文本和精确的跨模态对齐显著提升检索性能

Abstract: Composed video retrieval is a challenging task that strives to retrieve a
target video based on a query video and a textual description detailing
specific modifications. Standard retrieval frameworks typically struggle to
handle the complexity of fine-grained compositional queries and variations in
temporal understanding limiting their retrieval ability in the fine-grained
setting. To address this issue, we introduce a novel dataset that captures both
fine-grained and composed actions across diverse video segments, enabling more
detailed compositional changes in retrieved video content. The proposed
dataset, named Dense-WebVid-CoVR, consists of 1.6 million samples with dense
modification text that is around seven times more than its existing
counterpart. We further develop a new model that integrates visual and textual
information through Cross-Attention (CA) fusion using grounded text encoder,
enabling precise alignment between dense query modifications and target videos.
The proposed model achieves state-of-the-art results surpassing existing
methods on all metrics. Notably, it achieves 71.3\% Recall@1 in visual+text
setting and outperforms the state-of-the-art by 3.4\%, highlighting its
efficacy in terms of leveraging detailed video descriptions and dense
modification texts. Our proposed dataset, code, and model are available at

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: CT-CRS是一个基于消费者类型建模的对话推荐系统，通过实时推断用户决策风格和知识水平，动态调整推荐策略，显著提高了推荐成功率和交互效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对话推荐系统大多忽视了用户的异质性决策风格和知识水平，这限制了系统的准确性和效率。需要一种能够识别并适应不同用户类型的方法来提升个性化服务。

Method: 基于消费者类型理论定义四类用户（依赖型、效率型、谨慎型、专家型），利用交互历史和微调大语言模型实时推断用户类型，并设计类型自适应策略动态调整推荐粒度、多样性和属性查询复杂度，采用逆强化学习优化对话策略。

Result: 在LastFM、Amazon-Book和Yelp数据集上的实验表明，CT-CRS相比强基线提高了推荐成功率并减少了交互轮次，消融研究证实消费者类型建模和逆强化学习都对性能提升有显著贡献。

Conclusion: CT-CRS通过整合心理建模和先进策略优化，为增强对话推荐系统的个性化提供了一个可扩展且可解释的解决方案，证明了考虑用户异质性的重要性。

Abstract: Conversational Recommender Systems (CRS) provide personalized services
through multi-turn interactions, yet most existing methods overlook users'
heterogeneous decision-making styles and knowledge levels, which constrains
both accuracy and efficiency. To address this gap, we propose CT-CRS (Consumer
Type-Enhanced Conversational Recommender System), a framework that integrates
consumer type modeling into dialogue recommendation. Based on consumer type
theory, we define four user categories--dependent, efficient, cautious, and
expert--derived from two dimensions: decision-making style (maximizers vs.
satisficers) and knowledge level (high vs. low). CT-CRS employs interaction
histories and fine-tunes the large language model to automatically infer user
types in real time, avoiding reliance on static questionnaires. We incorporate
user types into state representation and design a type-adaptive policy that
dynamically adjusts recommendation granularity, diversity, and attribute query
complexity. To further optimize the dialogue policy, we adopt Inverse
Reinforcement Learning (IRL), enabling the agent to approximate expert-like
strategies conditioned on consumer type. Experiments on LastFM, Amazon-Book,
and Yelp show that CTCRS improves recommendation success rate and reduces
interaction turns compared to strong baselines. Ablation studies confirm that
both consumer type modeling and IRL contribute significantly to performance
gains. These results demonstrate that CT-CRS offers a scalable and
interpretable solution for enhancing CRS personalization through the
integration of psychological modeling and advanced policy optimization.

Result: 在真实环境评估中，FLAIR在已见和未见查询上都表现出显著性能提升，超越了最先进方法，已在微软服务数千用户

Conclusion: FLAIR框架通过整合专家反馈有效提升了copilot系统的检索性能，证明了其在操作环境中的可扩展性和有效性

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have driven the adoption of
copilots in complex technical scenarios, underscoring the growing need for
specialized information retrieval solutions. In this paper, we introduce FLAIR,
a lightweight, feedback learning framework that adapts copilot systems'
retrieval strategies by integrating domain-specific expert feedback. FLAIR
operates in two stages: an offline phase obtains indicators from (1) user
feedback and (2) questions synthesized from documentation, storing these
indicators in a decentralized manner. An online phase then employs a two-track
ranking mechanism to combine raw similarity scores with the collected
indicators. This iterative setup refines retrieval performance for any query.
Extensive real-world evaluations of FLAIR demonstrate significant performance
gains on both previously seen and unseen queries, surpassing state-of-the-art
approaches. The system has been successfully integrated into Copilot DECO,
serving thousands of users at Microsoft, demonstrating its scalability and
effectiveness in operational environments.

TL;DR: CASPER是一个用于科学文献检索的稀疏检索模型，使用标记和关键词作为表示单元，通过学术引用挖掘训练数据，在8个科学检索基准上优于现有方法，并能高效用于关键词生成任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 科学文献的指数级增长使研究人员难以跟上文献发展，需要更有效的检索方法来缓解这个问题。

Method: 提出CASPER稀疏检索模型，使用标记和关键词作为表示单元；通过挖掘学术引用（标题、引用上下文、作者分配的关键词、共引）来获取训练数据；支持细粒度和概念级别的匹配。

Result: 在8个科学检索基准上优于强密的和稀疏的检索基线；通过简单后处理可用于关键词生成任务，性能与CopyRNN相当但产生更多样化的关键词且速度快近4倍。

Conclusion: CASPER通过创新的表示单元设计和训练数据挖掘方法，在科学文献检索和关键词生成方面都表现出色，为解决科学文献爆炸问题提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The exponential growth of scientific literature has made it increasingly
difficult for researchers to keep up with the literature. In an attempt to
alleviate this problem, we propose CASPER, a sparse retrieval model for
scientific search that utilizes tokens and keyphrases as representation units
(i.e. dimensions in the sparse embedding space), enabling it to represent
queries and documents with research concepts and match them at both granular
and conceptual levels. To overcome the lack of suitable training data, we
propose mining training data by leveraging scholarly references (i.e. signals
that capture how research concepts of papers are expressed in different
settings), including titles, citation contexts, author-assigned keyphrases, and
co-citations. CASPER outperforms strong dense and sparse retrieval baselines on
eight scientific retrieval benchmarks. Moreover, we demonstrate that through
simple post-processing, CASPER can be effectively used for the keyphrase
generation tasks, achieving competitive performance with the established
CopyRNN while producing more diverse keyphrases and being nearly four times
faster.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决对话推荐系统中代理系统响应延迟的长期挑战，平衡处理复杂查询和最小化延迟之间的权衡。

Method: 使用用户查询复杂度识别机制：简单查询直接选择工具快速响应；复杂查询通过记忆处理模块筛选聊天历史，智能任务分解规划器分解任务，最后使用个性化推荐工具执行。

Result: 在沃尔玛真实职业推荐场景中评估，相比竞争基线平均响应延迟降低高达53.3%，同时显著提高推荐准确性。

Conclusion: AdaptJobRec成功实现了在保持推荐质量的同时显著降低响应延迟的目标，为对话推荐系统提供了有效的延迟优化解决方案。

Abstract: In recent years, recommendation systems have evolved from providing a single
list of recommendations to offering a comprehensive suite of topic focused
services. To better accomplish this task, conversational recommendation systems
(CRS) have progressed from basic retrieval augmented LLM generation to agentic
systems with advanced reasoning and self correction capabilities. However,
agentic systems come with notable response latency, a longstanding challenge
for conversational recommendation systems. To balance the trade off between
handling complex queries and minimizing latency, we propose AdaptJobRec, the
first conversational job recommendation system that leverages autonomous agent
to integrate personalized recommendation algorithm tools. The system employs a
user query complexity identification mechanism to minimize response latency.
For straightforward queries, the agent directly selects the appropriate tool
for rapid responses. For complex queries, the agent uses the memory processing
module to filter chat history for relevant content, then passes the results to
the intelligent task decomposition planner, and finally executes the tasks
using personalized recommendation tools. Evaluation on Walmart's real world
career recommendation scenarios demonstrates that AdaptJobRec reduces average
response latency by up to 53.3% compared to competitive baselines, while
significantly improving recommendation accuracy.

TL;DR: L3AE是首个将大语言模型(LLMs)集成到线性自编码器(LAE)框架中的方法，通过两阶段优化策略有效整合文本语义和用户-物品交互信息，显著提升了推荐系统性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的线性自编码器在整合文本信息时依赖稀疏的词共现模式，无法充分捕捉丰富的文本语义信息，限制了推荐系统的表现。

Method: 采用两阶段优化策略：(i)从LLM生成的物品表示构建语义物品相关性矩阵；(ii)从协同信号学习物品权重矩阵，同时将语义相关性作为正则化项。每个阶段都通过闭式解优化，确保全局最优和计算效率。

Result: 在三个基准数据集上，L3AE consistently outperforms state-of-the-art LLM-enhanced models on three benchmark datasets, achieving gains of 27.6% in Recall@20 and 39.3% in NDCG@20.

Conclusion: L3AE成功将LLMs集成到LAE框架中，通过有效整合异构知识显著提升了推荐性能，证明了该方法在语义增强推荐系统中的有效性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been widely adopted to enrich the semantic
representation of textual item information in recommender systems. However,
existing linear autoencoders (LAEs) that incorporate textual information rely
on sparse word co-occurrence patterns, limiting their ability to capture rich
textual semantics. To address this, we propose L3AE, the first integration of
LLMs into the LAE framework. L3AE effectively integrates the heterogeneous
knowledge of textual semantics and user-item interactions through a two-phase
optimization strategy. (i) L3AE first constructs a semantic item-to-item
correlation matrix from LLM-derived item representations. (ii) It then learns
an item-to-item weight matrix from collaborative signals while distilling
semantic item correlations as regularization. Notably, each phase of L3AE is
optimized through closed-form solutions, ensuring global optimality and
computational efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that L3AE
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art LLM-enhanced models on three
benchmark datasets, achieving gains of 27.6% in Recall@20 and 39.3% in NDCG@20.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统推荐方法只关注交互意愿，影响力最大化方法只关注传播范围，两者都存在局限性，需要结合两者优势来提升用户推荐系统的效果

Method: HeteroIR采用两阶段框架估计传播收益，HeteroIM基于反向可达集增量选择最有影响力的被邀请者并进行重排序

Result: 实验显示两个模型显著优于现有基线方法(p值<0.05)，在腾讯游戏平台在线A/B测试中分别获得8.5%和10%的提升

Conclusion: 提出的HeteroIR和HeteroIM模型成功解决了推荐系统和影响力最大化方法的局限性，实现了交互意愿和传播范围的双重优化

Abstract: User recommendation systems enhance user engagement by encouraging users to
act as inviters to interact with other users (invitees), potentially fostering
information propagation. Conventional recommendation methods typically focus on
modeling interaction willingness. Influence-Maximization (IM) methods focus on
identifying a set of users to maximize the information propagation. However,
existing methods face two significant challenges. First, recommendation methods
fail to unleash the candidates' spread capability. Second, IM methods fail to
account for the willingness to interact. To solve these issues, we propose two
models named HeteroIR and HeteroIM. HeteroIR provides an intuitive solution to
unleash the dissemination potential of user recommendation systems. HeteroIM
fills the gap between the IM method and the recommendation task, improving
interaction willingness and maximizing spread coverage. The HeteroIR introduces
a two-stage framework to estimate the spread profits. The HeteroIM
incrementally selects the most influential invitee to recommend and rerank
based on the number of reverse reachable (RR) sets containing inviters and
invitees. RR set denotes a set of nodes that can reach a target via
propagation. Extensive experiments show that HeteroIR and HeteroIM
significantly outperform the state-of-the-art baselines with the p-value <
0.05. Furthermore, we have deployed HeteroIR and HeteroIM in Tencent's online
gaming platforms and gained an 8.5\% and 10\% improvement in the online A/B
test, respectively. Implementation codes are available at

Motivation: 现有方法在长序列建模中破坏了两个基本要求：未能充分利用完整序列信息，以及无法保持学习到的兴趣与目标项目的高相关性，导致在线服务系统性能受限。

Method: 提出两阶段方法ENCODE：1）离线阶段使用基于度量学习的降维算法聚类完整行为序列提取准确兴趣；2）在线阶段使用预提取的用户兴趣预测与目标项目的关联，并在整个流程中采用相同的相关性度量标准。

Result: 通过与最先进方法的广泛实验比较，证明了ENCODE在效果和效率方面的优越性。

Conclusion: ENCODE方法成功平衡了在线服务效率和精度，满足了长序列建模的两个基本要求，为CTR预测提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Long-term user behavior sequences are a goldmine for businesses to explore
users' interests to improve Click-Through Rate. However, it is very challenging
to accurately capture users' long-term interests from their long-term behavior
sequences and give quick responses from the online serving systems. To meet
such requirements, existing methods "inadvertently" destroy two basic
requirements in long-term sequence modeling: R1) make full use of the entire
sequence to keep the information as much as possible; R2) extract information
from the most relevant behaviors to keep high relevance between learned
interests and current target items. The performance of online serving systems
is significantly affected by incomplete and inaccurate user interest
information obtained by existing methods. To this end, we propose an efficient
two-stage long-term sequence modeling approach, named as EfficieNt Clustering
based twO-stage interest moDEling (ENCODE), consisting of offline extraction
stage and online inference stage. It not only meets the aforementioned two
basic requirements but also achieves a desirable balance between online service
efficiency and precision. Specifically, in the offline extraction stage, ENCODE
clusters the entire behavior sequence and extracts accurate interests. To
reduce the overhead of the clustering process, we design a metric
learning-based dimension reduction algorithm that preserves the relative
pairwise distances of behaviors in the new feature space. While in the online
inference stage, ENCODE takes the off-the-shelf user interests to predict the
associations with target items. Besides, to further ensure the relevance
between user interests and target items, we adopt the same relevance metric
throughout the whole pipeline of ENCODE. The extensive experiment and
comparison with SOTA have demonstrated the effectiveness and efficiency of our
proposed ENCODE.

TL;DR: 传统推荐系统存在忽略用户次要兴趣领域的问题，校准推荐系统通过保证推荐列表包含较少代表性领域来解决这个问题，使用三维分布模型进行评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统推荐系统只推荐最相关或最相似的项目，会忽略用户配置文件中较不突出的项目类型，从而损害用户体验。

Method: 实现15个模型来分析用户配置文件、候选项目和推荐列表的三维分布结构，使用异常检测模型来理解这些分布的结构。

Result: 异常检测模型能更好地理解分布结构，校准系统创建的推荐列表与传统推荐列表表现相似，但允许用户同等程度地改变偏好组。

Conclusion: 校准推荐系统通过多维分布分析有效解决了传统推荐系统忽略次要兴趣领域的问题，异常检测模型在理解分布结构方面表现优异。

Abstract: Traditional recommender systems aim to generate a recommendation list
comprising the most relevant or similar items to the user's profile. These
approaches can create recommendation lists that omit item genres from the less
prominent areas of a user's profile, thereby undermining the user's experience.
To solve this problem, the calibrated recommendation system provides a
guarantee of including less representative areas in the recommended list. The
calibrated context works with three distributions. The first is from the user's
profile, the second is from the candidate items, and the last is from the
recommendation list. These distributions are G-dimensional, where G is the
total number of genres in the system. This high dimensionality requires a
different evaluation method, considering that traditional recommenders operate
in a one-dimensional data space. In this sense, we implement fifteen models
that help to understand how these distributions are structured. We evaluate the
users' patterns in three datasets from the movie domain. The results indicate
that the models of outlier detection provide a better understanding of the
structures. The calibrated system creates recommendation lists that act
similarly to traditional recommendation lists, allowing users to change their
groups of preferences to the same degree.

TL;DR: 提出MUFFIN模型，通过全局和局部滤波模块结合用户自适应滤波，解决现有频域序列推荐模型频带覆盖有限和缺乏个性化频率过滤的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有频域序列推荐模型存在两个主要缺陷：(i)频带覆盖有限，可能错过特定频率范围内的关键行为模式；(ii)缺乏个性化频率过滤，对所有用户使用相同的滤波器，忽略了用户独特的频率特征。

Method: 提出MUFFIN模型，包含两个互补模块：全局滤波模块(GFM)处理整个频谱以捕获全面的行为模式，局部滤波模块(LFM)选择性强调重要频带而不排除其他范围的信息。两个模块都采用用户自适应滤波器(UAF)来生成针对个体独特特征的用户特定频率滤波器。

Result: 在五个基准数据集上的广泛实验表明，MUFFIN始终优于最先进的频域序列推荐模型。

Conclusion: MUFFIN通过结合全局和局部滤波模块以及用户自适应滤波，能够捕获用户在整个频谱上的多样化行为模式，显著提升了序列推荐的性能。

Abstract: Sequential recommendation (SR) aims to predict users' subsequent interactions
by modeling their sequential behaviors. Recent studies have explored frequency
domain analysis, which effectively models periodic patterns in user sequences.
However, existing frequency-domain SR models still face two major drawbacks:
(i) limited frequency band coverage, often missing critical behavioral patterns
in a specific frequency range, and (ii) lack of personalized frequency
filtering, as they apply an identical filter for all users regardless of their
distinct frequency characteristics. To address these challenges, we propose a
novel frequency-domain model, Mixture of User-adaptive Frequency FIlteriNg
(MUFFIN), operating through two complementary modules. (i) The global filtering
module (GFM) handles the entire frequency spectrum to capture comprehensive
behavioral patterns. (ii) The local filtering module (LFM) selectively
emphasizes important frequency bands without excluding information from other
ranges. (iii) In both modules, the user-adaptive filter (UAF) is adopted to
generate user-specific frequency filters tailored to individual unique
characteristics. Finally, by aggregating both modules, MUFFIN captures diverse
user behavioral patterns across the full frequency spectrum. Extensive
experiments show that MUFFIN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
frequency-domain SR models over five benchmark datasets. The source code is

Motivation: 当前多模态推荐系统虽然利用图神经网络取得了成功，但在真实稀疏数据场景下面临两个主要限制：1）简单的多模态特征对比无法产生有效表示，导致模态共享特征噪声和模态独特特征信息丢失；2）缺乏对用户兴趣和物品共现同构关系的探索，导致用户-物品交互挖掘不完整

Method: 提出REARM框架：1）使用元网络和正交约束策略来补充多模态对比学习，过滤模态共享特征中的噪声并保留模态独特特征中的推荐相关信息；2）整合新构建的用户兴趣图和物品共现图与现有的用户共现图和物品语义图进行图学习

Result: 在三个真实世界数据集上的广泛实验表明，REARM优于各种最先进的基线方法。可视化进一步显示REARM在区分模态共享和模态独特特征方面有所改进

Conclusion: REARM通过改进的多模态对比学习和同构图关系挖掘，有效解决了多模态推荐系统中的数据稀疏性问题，提高了推荐性能

Abstract: Multi-modal recommender system focuses on utilizing rich modal information (
i.e., images and textual descriptions) of items to improve recommendation
performance. The current methods have achieved remarkable success with the
powerful structure modeling capability of graph neural networks. However, these
methods are often hindered by sparse data in real-world scenarios. Although
contrastive learning and homography ( i.e., homogeneous graphs) are employed to
address the data sparsity challenge, existing methods still suffer two main
limitations: 1) Simple multi-modal feature contrasts fail to produce effective
representations, causing noisy modal-shared features and loss of valuable
information in modal-unique features; 2) The lack of exploration of the
homograph relations between user interests and item co-occurrence results in
incomplete mining of user-item interplay.
  To address the above limitations, we propose a novel framework for
\textbf{R}\textbf{E}fining multi-mod\textbf{A}l cont\textbf{R}astive learning
and ho\textbf{M}ography relations (\textbf{REARM}). Specifically, we complement
multi-modal contrastive learning by employing meta-network and orthogonal
constraint strategies, which filter out noise in modal-shared features and
retain recommendation-relevant information in modal-unique features. To mine
homogeneous relationships effectively, we integrate a newly constructed user
interest graph and an item co-occurrence graph with the existing user
co-occurrence and item semantic graphs for graph learning. The extensive
experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of REARM
to various state-of-the-art baselines. Our visualization further shows an
improvement made by REARM in distinguishing between modal-shared and
modal-unique features. Code is available

TL;DR: UniECS是一个统一的多模态电商搜索框架，通过门控多模态编码器和综合训练策略，在图像、文本及其组合的所有检索场景中表现优异，并在实际部署中显著提升了点击率和收入。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前电商多模态检索系统存在两个主要限制：针对特定任务优化且模态配对固定，缺乏评估统一检索方法的综合基准。

Method: 提出灵活架构（门控多模态编码器+自适应融合机制）、综合训练策略（CMAL、CLAL、IMCL+自适应损失加权）、创建M-BEER基准数据集。

Result: 在四个电商基准测试中持续优于现有方法，在M-BEER基准上跨模态任务提升显著（文本到图像检索R@10提升28%），参数量仅0.2B但优于更大模型。实际部署中点击率提升2.74%，收入提升8.33%。

Conclusion: UniECS在实验和实际场景中都证明了其有效性，为电商多模态检索提供了统一的解决方案。

Abstract: Current e-commerce multimodal retrieval systems face two key limitations:
they optimize for specific tasks with fixed modality pairings, and lack
comprehensive benchmarks for evaluating unified retrieval approaches. To
address these challenges, we introduce UniECS, a unified multimodal e-commerce
search framework that handles all retrieval scenarios across image, text, and
their combinations. Our work makes three key contributions. First, we propose a
flexible architecture with a novel gated multimodal encoder that uses adaptive
fusion mechanisms. This encoder integrates different modality representations
while handling missing modalities. Second, we develop a comprehensive training
strategy to optimize learning. It combines cross-modal alignment loss (CMAL),
cohesive local alignment loss (CLAL), intra-modal contrastive loss (IMCL), and
adaptive loss weighting. Third, we create M-BEER, a carefully curated
multimodal benchmark containing 50K product pairs for e-commerce search
evaluation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UniECS consistently
outperforms existing methods across four e-commerce benchmarks with fine-tuning
or zero-shot evaluation. On our M-BEER bench, UniECS achieves substantial
improvements in cross-modal tasks (up to 28\% gain in R@10 for text-to-image
retrieval) while maintaining parameter efficiency (0.2B parameters) compared to
larger models like GME-Qwen2VL (2B) and MM-Embed (8B). Furthermore, we deploy
UniECS in the e-commerce search platform of Kuaishou Inc. across two search
scenarios, achieving notable improvements in Click-Through Rate (+2.74\%) and
Revenue (+8.33\%). The comprehensive evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness
of our approach in both experimental and real-world settings. Corresponding
codes, models and datasets will be made publicly available at

Motivation: 应对极端气候事件，传统的可持续生活方式推广方法存在要求过高或参与度低的问题，需要更主动有效的干预手段

Method: 设计GRAPE推荐系统，优先推荐符合用户变化偏好的可持续食物选项；创建两种绿色损失函数，分别处理均匀优先级和差异化优先级的绿色指标

Result: 在真实数据集上进行了广泛实验，证明了GRAPE系统的有效性

Conclusion: 通过推荐系统主动引导用户向可持续选择转变是一种有效的方法，为促进可持续生活方式提供了新的技术解决方案

Abstract: The recent emergence of extreme climate events has significantly raised
awareness about sustainable living. In addition to developing energy-saving
materials and technologies, existing research mainly relies on traditional
methods that encourage behavioral shifts towards sustainability, which can be
overly demanding or only passively engaging. In this work, we propose to employ
recommendation systems to actively nudge users toward more sustainable choices.
We introduce Green Recommender Aligned with Personalized Eating (GRAPE), which
is designed to prioritize and recommend sustainable food options that align
with users' evolving preferences. We also design two innovative Green Loss
functions that cater to green indicators with either uniform or differentiated
priorities, thereby enhancing adaptability across a range of scenarios.
Extensive experiments on a real-world dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of
our GRAPE.

TL;DR: 提出CARE框架，通过结合外部推荐系统与LLMs来提升对话推荐的准确性，解决了基础LLM的推荐系统存在的预测准确性低和忽视协作关系的问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于LLM的对话推荐系统存在两个主要问题：缺乏领域知识导致推荐准确性低，以及忽视实体间的协作关系

Method: 提出CARE框架，将外部推荐系统作为领域专家集成到LLMs中，通过实体级见解生成推荐，并利用上下文信息进行更准确的最终推荐

Result: 在ReDial和INSPIRED数据集上，推荐准确性分别提升了54%和25%，最有效的策略是由LLMs选择和重新排序外部推荐系统提供的候选项目

Conclusion: CARE框架有效解决了基础LLM的推荐系统的问题，并减轻了外部推荐系统的流行度偏见

Abstract: We tackle the challenge of integrating large language models (LLMs) with
external recommender systems to enhance domain expertise in conversational
recommendation (CRS). Current LLM-based CRS approaches primarily rely on zero-
or few-shot methods for generating item recommendations based on user queries,
but this method faces two significant challenges: (1) without domain-specific
adaptation, LLMs frequently recommend items not in the target item space,
resulting in low recommendation accuracy; and (2) LLMs largely rely on dialogue
context for content-based recommendations, neglecting the collaborative
relationships among entities or item sequences. To address these limitations,
we introduce the CARE (Contextual Adaptation of Recommenders) framework. CARE
customizes LLMs for CRS tasks, and synergizes them with external recommendation
systems. CARE (a) integrates external recommender systems as domain experts,
producing recommendations through entity-level insights, and (b) enhances those
recommendations by leveraging contextual information for more accurate and
unbiased final recommendations using LLMs. Our results demonstrate that
incorporating external recommender systems with entity-level information
significantly enhances recommendation accuracy of LLM-based CRS by an average
of 54% and 25% for ReDial and INSPIRED datasets. The most effective strategy in
the CARE framework involves LLMs selecting and reranking candidate items that
external recommenders provide based on contextual insights. Our analysis
indicates that the CARE framework effectively addresses the identified
challenges and mitigates the popularity bias in the external recommender.

Motivation: 现有的合成查询生成流程在生成质量和效果方面有限，需要更好的方法来提升生成查询的信号质量和减少过度过滤的需求。

Method: 首先在SciFact数据集上验证了InPars、InPars-V2和Promptagator流程的可复现性，然后提出两项扩展：1）使用对比偏好优化（CPO）细调查询生成器LLM；2）使用DSPy框架实现动态的链式思维（CoT）优化提示来替代静态提示模板。

Result: 两项扩展都能在减少激进过滤的同时提高检索性能，生成的查询质量更高。

Conclusion: 通过CPO细调和动态CoT提示的方法，可以有效提升合成查询生成的质量和效果，为神经信息检索领域提供了更好的训练数据生成方案。所有代码、模型和数据集都已开源。

Abstract: This work revisits and extends synthetic query generation pipelines for
Neural Information Retrieval (NIR) by leveraging the InPars Toolkit, a
reproducible, end-to-end framework for generating training data using large

InPars, InPars-V2, and Promptagator pipelines on the SciFact benchmark and
validate their effectiveness using open-source reranker and generator models.
Building on this foundation, we introduce two key extensions to the pipeline:
(1) fine-tuning a query generator LLM via Contrastive Preference Optimization
(CPO) to improve the signal quality in generated queries, and (2) replacing
static prompt templates with dynamic, Chain-of-Thought (CoT) optimized prompts
using the DSPy framework. Our results show that both extensions reduce the need

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 提出A2CG框架，在新闻推荐系统的最早阶段引入多样性，通过多角度表示和向量量化变分自编码器实现规范多样性，解决现有方法只关注后期多样性和忽视规范多样性的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于点击历史的新闻推荐系统虽然能提高用户参与度，但限制了内容多样性。现有多样性算法存在两个主要局限：无法考虑规范多样性（要求公平获取广泛视角），以及通常在系统流程后期才应用多样性，此时大量内容已被过滤。

Method: 使用Aspect-Aware Candidate Generation (A2CG)框架，通过多角度（如情感、政治倾向、框架）表示新闻文章，采用VQ-VAE创建离散的多方面表示，使用仅解码器模型学习用户偏好，在候选检索过程中通过反转查询向量某些方面的符号来直接注入多样性。

Result: 在MIND数据集上的评估显示，该方法能在推荐流程早期实现个性化与多样性的灵活权衡，生成更新颖、多样和意外的候选内容，同时有效考虑加强民主价值的方面。

Conclusion: A2CG是一个有前景的方法，可用于下游民主化新闻推荐系统，有效解决了现有多样性推荐方法的局限性。

Abstract: Current News Recommender Systems based on past clicks are designed for
engagement, but come at the cost of limiting diversity in the suggested
content. While diversity-aware algorithms exist, they suffer from two major
limitations. First, they fail to account for normative diversity, which
requires fair access to a broad range of perspectives. Second, they typically
apply diversity late in the system's pipeline, after a lot of content has
already been filtered out. Both limitations confine their effectiveness and
prevent them from promoting true normative diversity in news recommendations.
  We propose Aspect-Aware Candidate Generation (A2CG) to address these
limitations. Our framework introduces diversity into the earliest pipeline
stage and uses a configurable mechanism to align diversity with specific
democratic goals. A2CG represents each news article using multiple aspects of
perspectives (e.g., sentiment, political leaning, frame) and uses a Vector
Quantized Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE) to create a discrete, multi-faceted
representation. A decoder-only model then learns user preferences over these
aspect codes. We then inject diversity directly by reversing the sign on some
of the query vector's aspects during the candidate retrieval process, ensuring
a more diverse set of candidates.
  Our method, evaluated on the MIND dataset, enables a flexible trade-off
between personalization and diversity early in the recommendation pipeline. It
also generates more novel, diverse, and serendipitous candidates while
effectively taking into account aspects that strengthen democratic values.
These empirical results make it a promising approach for downstream
democratized news recommendation systems.

Abstract: This paper maps Africa's distinctive AI risk profile, from deepfake fuelled
electoral interference and data colonial dependency to compute scarcity, labour
disruption and disproportionate exposure to climate driven environmental costs.
While major benefits are promised to accrue, the availability, development and
adoption of AI also mean that African people and countries face particular AI
safety risks, from large scale labour market disruptions to the nefarious use
of AI to manipulate public opinion. To date, African perspectives have not been
meaningfully integrated into global debates and processes regarding AI safety,
leaving African stakeholders with limited influence over the emerging global AI
safety governance agenda. While there are Computer Incident Response Teams on
the continent, none hosts a dedicated AI Safety Institute or office. We propose
a five-point action plan centred on (i) a policy approach that foregrounds the
protection of the human rights of those most vulnerable to experiencing the
harmful socio-economic effects of AI; (ii) the establishment of an African AI
Safety Institute; (iii) promote public AI literacy and awareness; (iv)
development of early warning system with inclusive benchmark suites for 25+
African languages; and (v) an annual AU-level AI Safety & Security Forum.

Abstract: Homelessness is a persistent social challenge, impacting millions worldwide.
Over 770,000 people experienced homelessness in the U.S. in 2024. Social
stigmatization is a significant barrier to alleviation, shifting public
perception, and influencing policymaking. Given that online and city council
discourse reflect and influence part of public opinion, it provides valuable
insights to identify and track social biases. This research contributes to
alleviating homelessness by acting on public opinion. It introduces novel
methods, building on natural language processing (NLP) and large language
models (LLMs), to identify and measure PEH social bias expressed in digital
spaces. We present a new, manually-annotated multi-modal dataset compiled from
Reddit, X (formerly Twitter), news articles, and city council meeting minutes
across 10 U.S. cities. This unique dataset provides evidence of the typologies
of homelessness bias described in the literature. In order to scale up and
automate the detection of homelessness bias online, we evaluate LLMs as
classifiers. We applied both zero-shot and few-shot classification techniques
to this data. We utilized local LLMs (Llama 3.2 3B Instruct, Qwen 2.5 7B
Instruct, and Phi4 Instruct Mini) as well as closed-source API models (GPT-4.1,
Gemini 2.5 Pro, and Grok-4). Our findings reveal that although there are
significant inconsistencies in local LLM zero-shot classification, the
in-context learning classification scores of local LLMs approach the
classification scores of closed-source LLMs. Furthermore, LLMs outperform BERT
when averaging across all categories. This work aims to raise awareness about
the pervasive bias against PEH, develop new indicators to inform policy, and
ultimately enhance the fairness and ethical application of Generative AI
technologies.

Conclusion: 研究结果为生成式AI在临床实践中的未来实施提供了有用的仪体指导

Abstract: The increasing burden of responding to large volumes of patient messages has
become a key factor contributing to physician burnout. Generative AI (GenAI)
shows great promise to alleviate this burden by automatically drafting patient
message replies. The ethical implications of this use have however not been
fully explored. To address this knowledge gap, we conducted a semi-structured
interview study with 21 physicians who participated in a GenAI pilot program.
We found that notable ethical considerations expressed by the physician
participants included human oversight as ethical safeguard, transparency and
patient consent of AI use, patient misunderstanding of AI's role, and patient
privacy and data security as prerequisites. Additionally, our findings suggest
that the physicians believe the ethical responsibility of using GenAI in this
context primarily lies with users, not with the technology. These findings may
provide useful insights into guiding the future implementation of GenAI in
clinical practice.

Abstract: Curriculum analytics (CA) studies curriculum structure and student data to
ensure the quality of educational programs. An essential aspect is studying
course properties, which involves assigning each course a representative
difficulty value. This is critical for several aspects of CA, such as quality
control (e.g., monitoring variations over time), course comparisons (e.g.,
articulation), and course recommendation (e.g., advising). Measuring course
difficulty requires careful consideration of multiple factors: First, when
difficulty measures are sensitive to the performance level of enrolled
students, it can bias interpretations by overlooking student diversity. By
assessing difficulty independently of enrolled students' performances, we can
reduce the risk of bias and enable fair, representative assessments of
difficulty. Second, from a measurement theoretic perspective, the measurement
must be reliable and valid to provide a robust basis for subsequent analyses.
Third, difficulty measures should account for covariates, such as the
characteristics of individual students within a diverse populations (e.g.,
transfer status). In recent years, various notions of difficulty have been
proposed. This paper provides the first comprehensive review and comparison of
existing approaches for assessing course difficulty based on grade point
averages and latent trait modeling. It further offers a hands-on tutorial on
model selection, assumption checking, and practical CA applications. These
applications include monitoring course difficulty over time and detecting
courses with disparate outcomes between distinct groups of students (e.g.,
dropouts vs. graduates), ultimately aiming to promote high-quality, fair, and
equitable learning experiences. To support further research and application, we
provide an open-source software package and artificial datasets, facilitating
reproducibility and adoption.

Abstract: Consumer agency in the digital age is increasingly constrained by systemic
barriers and algorithmic manipulation, raising concerns about the authenticity
of consumption choices. Nowadays, financial decisions are shaped by external
pressures like obligatory consumption, algorithmic persuasion, and unstable
work schedules that erode financial autonomy. Obligatory consumption (like
hidden fees) is intensified by digital ecosystems. Algorithmic tactics like
personalized recommendations lead to impulsive purchases. Unstable work
schedules also undermine financial planning. Thus, it is important to study how
these factors impact consumption agency. To do so, we examine formal models
grounded in discounted consumption with constraints that bound agency. We
construct analytical scenarios in which consumers face obligatory payments,
algorithm-influenced impulsive expenses, or unpredictable income due to
temporal instability. Using this framework, we demonstrate that even rational,
utility-maximizing agents can experience early financial ruin when agency is
limited across structural, behavioral, or temporal dimensions and how
diminished autonomy impacts long-term financial well-being. Our central
argument is that consumer agency must be treated as a value (not a given)
requiring active cultivation, especially in digital ecosystems. The connection
between our formal modeling and this argument allows us to indicate that
limitations on agency (whether structural, behavioral, or temporal) can be
rigorously linked to measurable risks like financial instability. This
connection is also a basis for normative claims about consumption as a value,
by anchoring them in a formally grounded analysis of consumer behavior. As
solutions, we study systemic interventions and consumer education to support
value deliberation and informed choices. We formally demonstrate how these
measures strengthen agency.

Abstract: As AI systems become more capable, integrated, and widespread, understanding
the associated risks becomes increasingly important. This paper maps the full
spectrum of AI risks, from current harms affecting individual users to
existential threats that could endanger humanity's survival. We organize these
risks into three main causal categories. Misuse risks, which occur when people
deliberately use AI for harmful purposes - creating bioweapons, launching
cyberattacks, adversarial AI attacks or deploying lethal autonomous weapons.
Misalignment risks happen when AI systems pursue outcomes that conflict with
human values, irrespective of developer intentions. This includes risks arising
through specification gaming (reward hacking), scheming and power-seeking
tendencies in pursuit of long-term strategic goals. Systemic risks, which arise
when AI integrates into complex social systems in ways that gradually undermine
human agency - concentrating power, accelerating political and economic
disempowerment, creating overdependence that leads to human enfeeblement, or
irreversibly locking in current values curtailing future moral progress. Beyond
these core categories, we identify risk amplifiers - competitive pressures,
accidents, corporate indifference, and coordination failures - that make all
risks more likely and severe. Throughout, we connect today's existing risks and
empirically observable AI behaviors to plausible future outcomes, demonstrating
how existing trends could escalate to catastrophic outcomes. Our goal is to
help readers understand the complete landscape of AI risks. Good futures are
possible, but they don't happen by default. Navigating these challenges will
require unprecedented coordination, but an extraordinary future awaits if we
do.

### [106] [Exit Stories: Using Reddit Self-Disclosures to Understand Disengagement from Problematic Communities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13837)
*Shruti Phadke*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 这篇论文分析了Reddit平台上15K个退出故事，探讨用户如何脱离宗教、男怨圈、阴谋论等有害群体的多面过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解用户自然退出有害群体的过程，为设计干预措施提供见解，帮助人们脱离有害意识形态。

Method: 使用跨学科框架，结合社会心理学、组织行为学和极端主义研究理论，分析131个子红板上的15K个退出故事。

Result: 发现脱离阴谋论等有问题群体是一个多面性过程，与脱离宗教等稳定结构有质的不同。

Conclusion: 需要超越仅将阴谋论视为信息问题的干预方式，并为退出社区提供心理健康支持和干预措施。

Abstract: Online platforms like Reddit are increasingly becoming popular for
individuals sharing personal experiences of leaving behind social, ideological,
and political groups. Specifically, a series of "ex-" subreddits on Reddit
allow users to recount their departures from commitments such as religious
affiliations, manosphere communities, conspiracy theories or political beliefs,
and lifestyle choices. Understanding the natural process through which users
exit, especially from problematic groups such as conspiracy theory communities
and the manosphere, can provide valuable insights for designing interventions
targeting disengagement from harmful ideologies. This paper presents an
in-depth exploration of 15K exit stories across 131 subreddits, focusing on
five key areas: religion, manosphere, conspiracy theories, politics, and
lifestyle. Using a transdisciplinary framework that incorporates theories from
social psychology, organizational behavior, and violent extremism studies, this
work identifies a range of factors contributing to disengagement. The results
describe how disengagement from problematic groups, such as conspiracy theories
and the manosphere, is a multi-faceted process that is qualitatively different
than disengaging from more established social structures, such as religions or
political ideologies. This research further highlights the need for moving
beyond interventions that treat conspiracy theorizing solely as an information
problem and contributes insights for future research focusing on offering
mental health interventions and support in exit communities.

TL;DR: 本文提出了AI欺诈钻石模型，在传统欺诈三角理论基础上增加技术不透明性作为第四要素，建立了AI欺诈的五类分类体系，并通过专家访谈验证了该模型在审计实践中的适用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI系统在组织流程中的广泛应用，出现了新型的、隐蔽的、系统性的AI欺诈行为，这些欺诈往往隐藏在技术复杂性中，传统审计方法难以有效检测。

Method: 扩展传统欺诈三角理论，提出AI欺诈钻石模型（增加技术不透明性）；建立AI欺诈的五类分类法；通过对四大会计师事务所审计专家的访谈来验证模型的适用性。

Result: 研究发现审计人员在面对不透明和自动化环境时面临重大挑战，包括技术专业知识有限、跨学科协作不足、内部系统访问受限等问题，这些因素阻碍了欺诈检测和问责。

Conclusion: 需要从基于结果的检查转向更注重诊断系统性漏洞的审计方法，为未来AI治理领域的实证研究和审计创新奠定基础。

Abstract: As artificial intelligence (AI) systems become increasingly integral to
organizational processes, they introduce new forms of fraud that are often
subtle, systemic, and concealed within technical complexity. This paper
introduces the AI-Fraud Diamond, an extension of the traditional Fraud Triangle
that adds technical opacity as a fourth condition alongside pressure,
opportunity, and rationalization. Unlike traditional fraud, AI-enabled
deception may not involve clear human intent but can arise from system-level
features such as opaque model behavior, flawed training data, or unregulated
deployment practices. The paper develops a taxonomy of AI-fraud across five
categories: input data manipulation, model exploitation, algorithmic decision
manipulation, synthetic misinformation, and ethics-based fraud. To assess the
relevance and applicability of the AI-Fraud Diamond, the study draws on expert
interviews with auditors from two of the Big Four consulting firms. The
findings underscore the challenges auditors face when addressing fraud in
opaque and automated environments, including limited technical expertise,
insufficient cross-disciplinary collaboration, and constrained access to
internal system processes. These conditions hinder fraud detection and reduce
accountability. The paper argues for a shift in audit methodology-from
outcome-based checks to a more diagnostic approach focused on identifying
systemic vulnerabilities. Ultimately, the work lays a foundation for future
empirical research and audit innovation in a rapidly evolving AI governance
landscape.

<details>

Motivation: 现有多机器人系统依赖手动提示工程，计算效率低、能力有限且无法从数据中学习，需要一种更高效的本地化解决方案

Method: 提出链式机器人(CoA)新概念，通过多机器人精炼把最优多机器器系统转换为训练数据，再用机器人强化学习进一步提升模型在可验证任务上的能力

Result: Agent基础模型(AFM)在web agent和code agent多个测试集上创造了新的最优性能，证明了该方法的有效性

Conclusion: CoA方法为机器人模型研究提供了坚实基础，完整开源的研究成果包括模型权重、训练代码和训练数据，将推动机器人领域的未来发展

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and multi-agent systems have
demonstrated remarkable capabilities in complex problem-solving tasks such as
deep research, vibe coding, and mathematical reasoning. However, most existing
multi-agent systems are built upon manual prompt/workflow engineering with
sophisticated agent frameworks, making them computationally inefficient, less
capable, and can not benefit from data-centric learning. In this work, we
introduce Chain-of-Agents (CoA), a novel paradigm of LLM reasoning that enables
native end-to-end complex problem-solving in the same way as a multi-agent
system (i.e., multi-turn problem solving with multiple tools and multiple
agents) within one model. In chain-of-agents problem-solving, the model
dynamically activates different tool agents and role-playing agents to simulate
multi-agent collaboration in an end-to-end fashion. To elicit end-to-end
chain-of-agents problem-solving abilities in LLMs, we introduce a multi-agent
distillation framework to distill state-of-the-art multi-agent systems into
chain-of-agents trajectories for agentic supervised fine-tuning. We then use
agentic reinforcement learning on verifiable agentic tasks to further improve
the models' capabilities on chain-of-agents problem solving. We call the
resulting models Agent Foundation Models (AFMs). Our empirical studies
demonstrate that AFM establishes new state-of-the-art performance across
diverse benchmarks in both web agent and code agent settings. We make the
entire research, including the model weights, code for training and evaluation,
and the training data, fully open-sourced, which offers a solid starting point
for future research on agent models and agentic RL.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出Cognitive Workspace新范式，通过模拟人类外部记忆使用机制，超越传统RAG方法，实现主动记忆管理和任务驱动的上下文优化


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM在上下文管理方面存在根本性限制，尽管技术发展已实现百万token上下文窗口，但被动检索系统无法捕捉人类记忆管理的动态任务驱动特性

Method: 基于认知科学理论（Baddeley工作记忆模型、Clark扩展心智论、Hutchins分布式认知框架），采用三大核心创新：主动记忆管理、分层认知缓冲器、任务驱动上下文优化

Result: 实证验证显示平均58.6%记忆重用率（传统RAG为0%），净效率增益17-18%，统计显著性p<0.001，Cohen's d>23

Conclusion: Cognitive Workspace代表了从信息检索到真正认知增强的根本性转变，为LLM系统提供了首个主动记忆优势的量化证据

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) face fundamental limitations in context
management despite recent advances extending context windows to millions of
tokens. We propose Cognitive Workspace, a novel paradigm that transcends
traditional Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) by emulating human cognitive
mechanisms of external memory use. Drawing from cognitive science foundations
including Baddeley's working memory model, Clark's extended mind thesis, and
Hutchins' distributed cognition framework, we demonstrate that current passive
retrieval systems fail to capture the dynamic, task-driven nature of human
memory management. Our analysis of 2024-2025 developments reveals that while
techniques like Infini-attention and StreamingLLM achieve impressive context
lengths, they lack the metacognitive awareness and active planning capabilities
essential for true cognitive extension. Cognitive Workspace addresses these
limitations through three core innovations: (1) active memory management with
deliberate information curation, (2) hierarchical cognitive buffers enabling
persistent working states, and (3) task-driven context optimization that
dynamically adapts to cognitive demands. Empirical validation demonstrates
Cognitive Workspace achieves an average 58.6% memory reuse rate (ranging from
54-60% across different tasks) compared to 0% for traditional RAG, with 17-18%
net efficiency gain despite 3.3x higher operation counts. Statistical analysis
confirms these advantages with p < 0.001 and Cohen's d > 23 across multiple
task types, establishing the first quantitative evidence for active memory
superiority in LLM systems. We present a comprehensive theoretical framework
synthesizing insights from 50+ recent papers, positioning Cognitive Workspace
as a fundamental shift from information retrieval to genuine cognitive
augmentation.

TL;DR: AlphaEval是一个统一的、可并行化的、无需回测的自动化alpha挖掘模型评估框架，从五个维度全面评估alpha质量，比传统方法更高效全面。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有alpha挖掘评估方法存在局限性：回测计算密集且参数敏感，相关性指标只关注预测能力而忽略其他重要属性，且大多数模型闭源阻碍了可复现性。

Method: 提出AlphaEval框架，从五个互补维度评估alpha质量：预测能力、稳定性、市场扰动鲁棒性、金融逻辑性和多样性，无需进行传统回测。

Result: 实验表明AlphaEval在评估一致性上可与全面回测相媲美，同时提供更全面的洞察和更高效率，能有效识别优于传统单指标筛选方法的alpha。

Conclusion: AlphaEval解决了alpha挖掘系统评估的关键挑战，所有实现和评估工具都已开源以促进可复现性和社区参与。

Abstract: Formula alpha mining, which generates predictive signals from financial data,
is critical for quantitative investment. Although various algorithmic
approaches-such as genetic programming, reinforcement learning, and large
language models-have significantly expanded the capacity for alpha discovery,
systematic evaluation remains a key challenge. Existing evaluation metrics
predominantly include backtesting and correlation-based measures. Backtesting
is computationally intensive, inherently sequential, and sensitive to specific
strategy parameters. Correlation-based metrics, though efficient, assess only
predictive ability and overlook other crucial properties such as temporal
stability, robustness, diversity, and interpretability. Additionally, the
closed-source nature of most existing alpha mining models hinders
reproducibility and slows progress in this field. To address these issues, we
propose AlphaEval, a unified, parallelizable, and backtest-free evaluation
framework for automated alpha mining models. AlphaEval assesses the overall
quality of generated alphas along five complementary dimensions: predictive
power, stability, robustness to market perturbations, financial logic, and
diversity. Extensive experiments across representative alpha mining algorithms
demonstrate that AlphaEval achieves evaluation consistency comparable to
comprehensive backtesting, while providing more comprehensive insights and
higher efficiency. Furthermore, AlphaEval effectively identifies superior
alphas compared to traditional single-metric screening approaches. All
implementations and evaluation tools are open-sourced to promote
reproducibility and community engagement.

Motivation: 研究如何从给定的正负示例关系结构中自动拟合出合适的本体和约束，这对于知识表示和数据库系统的自动化构建具有重要意义。

Method: 使用描述逻辑EL和ELI以及多种类型的元组生成依赖(TGDs)作为本体和约束语言，通过理论分析和算法设计来研究拟合问题。

Result: 精确确定了各种语言下拟合问题的计算复杂度，设计了相应算法，分析了拟合本体和TGDs的规模，并发现某些TGDs类型不存在有限基。

Conclusion: 不同本体和约束语言在拟合问题上表现出不同的计算特性和有限基存在性，为实际应用中的语言选择提供了理论指导。

Abstract: We study the problem of fitting ontologies and constraints to positive and
negative examples that take the form of a finite relational structure. As
ontology and constraint languages, we consider the description logics
$\mathcal{E\mkern-2mu L}$ and $\mathcal{E\mkern-2mu LI}$ as well as several
classes of tuple-generating dependencies (TGDs): full, guarded,
frontier-guarded, frontier-one, and unrestricted TGDs as well as inclusion
dependencies. We pinpoint the exact computational complexity, design
algorithms, and analyze the size of fitting ontologies and TGDs. We also
investigate the related problem of constructing a finite basis of concept
inclusions / TGDs for a given set of finite structures. While finite bases
exist for $\mathcal{E\mkern-2mu L}$, $\mathcal{E\mkern-2mu LI}$, guarded TGDs,
and inclusion dependencies, they in general do not exist for full,
frontier-guarded and frontier-one TGDs.

Motivation: 提升文本到SQL模型在真实应用中的基础能力和泛化能力，特别是在处理WHERE子句语义解析时减少对条件列数据和人工标注训练数据的依赖。

Method: 整合模型可解释性分析和执行引导策略，结合过滤调整、逻辑关联优化和模型融合技术，设计条件增强的CESQL模型。

Conclusion: 这项工作为处理复杂查询和真实数据库环境中不规则数据场景的研究提供了新的视角和方法基础。

Abstract: To elevate the foundational capabilities and generalization prowess of the
text-to-SQL model in real-world applications, we integrate model
interpretability analysis with execution-guided strategy for semantic parsing
of WHERE clauses in SQL queries. Furthermore, we augment this approach with
filtering adjustments, logical correlation refinements, and model fusion,
culminating in the design of the CESQL model that facilitates conditional
enhancement. Our model excels on the WikiSQL dataset, which is emblematic of
single-table database query tasks, markedly boosting the accuracy of prediction
outcomes. When predicting conditional values in WHERE clauses, we have not only
minimized our dependence on data within the condition columns of tables but
also circumvented the impact of manually labeled training data. Our hope is
that this endeavor to enhance accuracy in processing basic database queries
will offer fresh perspectives for research into handling complex queries and
scenarios featuring irregular data in real-world database environments.

Motivation: 识别数据污染的类似问题：搜索时污染（STC），它会让搜索基于LLM的代理在评估时通过搜索获取到测试数据集的答案，而非真正进行推理，从而娱容评测结果的有效性。

Method: 在三个常用能力测试集（HLE、SimpleQA、GPQA）上进行实验，分析搜索基于代理的日志，识别是否从HuggingFace获取测试数据集。通过阻塞HuggingFace来测试污染对准确率的影响，并进行消融实验确认污染源。

Result: 约3%的问题能够直接从HuggingFace找到包含标签的数据集。阻塞HuggingFace后，被污染问题子集的准确率下降了15%。消融实验显示HuggingFace上公开的评估数据集可能不是唯一的污染源。

Conclusion: 提出了评测设计和结果报告的最佳实践，以应对这种新型泄漏问题，确保搜索基于LLM代理评估的可靠性。同时公开完整实验日志以便审计评估结果。

Abstract: Data contamination refers to the leakage of evaluation data into model
training data, resulting in overfitting to supposedly held-out test sets and
compromising test validity. We identify an analogous issue, search-time
contamination (STC), in evaluating search-based LLM agents which use tools to
gather information from online sources when answering user queries. STC occurs
when the retrieval step surfaces a source containing the test question (or a
near-duplicate) alongside its answer, enabling agents to copy rather than
genuinely infer or reason, undermining benchmark integrity. We find that
HuggingFace, an online platform hosting evaluation datasets, appears among
retrieved sources in search based agent logs. Consequently, agents often
explicitly acknowledge discovering question answer pairs from HuggingFace
within their reasoning chains. On three commonly used capability benchmarks:
Humanity's Last Exam (HLE), SimpleQA, and GPQA, we demonstrate that for
approximately 3% of questions, search-based agents directly find the datasets
with ground truth labels on HuggingFace. When millions of evaluation queries
target the same benchmark, even small, repeated leaks can accelerate the
benchmark's obsolescence, shortening its intended lifecycle. After HuggingFace
is blocked, we observe a drop in accuracy on the contaminated subset of
approximately 15%. We further show through ablation experiments that publicly
accessible evaluation datasets on HuggingFace may not be the sole source of
STC. To this end, we conclude by proposing best practices for benchmark design
and result reporting to address this novel form of leakage and ensure
trustworthy evaluation of search-based LLM agents. To facilitate the auditing
of evaluation results, we also publicly release the complete logs from our
experiments.

TL;DR: QuickMerge是一个轻量级token合并框架，通过注意力范数动态选择重要token，使用基于熵的预算估计器，并引入轻量级transformer先验来保持自回归兼容性，显著减少计算token数量同时保持生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着生成模型扩展到更大输入规模，token级别的计算成本成为关键瓶颈。现有token选择方法大多是静态的、模态特定的，或不兼容自回归生成。

Method: 基于注意力范数动态选择重要token，使用熵基预算估计器确定token数量，引入轻量级transformer先验在合并token序列上进行训练以保持自回归兼容性。

Result: 在多模态领域评估显示，QuickMerge显著减少token数量，同时匹配甚至超越学习型tokenizer和固定patch基线的性能，在计算-准确率权衡方面表现一致改进。

Conclusion: QuickMerge通过语义显著性估计、灵活token预算和自回归对齐的结合，实现了用更少token进行准确生成，有效解决了大规模生成模型的计算瓶颈问题。

Abstract: As generative models scale to larger inputs across language, vision, and
video domains, the cost of token-level computation has become a key bottleneck.
While prior work suggests that only a subset of tokens significantly influence
downstream predictions, most token selection methods are static,
modality-specific, or incompatible with autoregressive generation. In this
paper, we propose QuickMerge, a lightweight token merging framework designed
for efficient next-token prediction.
  QuickMerge dynamically selects a reduced number of tokens based on attention
norm magnitude, guided by an entropy-based budget estimator. To preserve
autoregressive compatibility, we introduce a lightweight transformer prior
trained over the merged token sequence. By combining semantic salience
estimation, flexible token budgets, and AR alignment, QuickMerge enables
accurate generation with fewer tokens.
  We evaluate QuickMerge across multi-modality domains, demonstrating
consistent improvements in compute-accuracy tradeoffs. Specifically, QuickMerge
reduces token counts sustantially while matching as well as exceeding the
performance of learned tokenizers and fixed-patch baselines.

Method: 提出基于网络的棋子相互作用指标，量化棋局中的战略强度，并对比分析人类对人类和AI对AI对局的动态变化

Result: AI玩家能在更长时间内维持更高的战略强度；人类游戏的累计强度在1600和2300伊洛分数段出现突增；AI完美平衡攻防战术，而人类则主动限制强度和复杂性

Conclusion: AI与人类在复杂战略环境中的性能差异可能来自于认知限制，这对AI在复杂战略领域的应用具有重要意义

Abstract: Strategic decision-making involves managing the tension between immediate
opportunities and long-term objectives. We study this trade-off in chess by
characterizing and comparing dynamics between human vs human and AI vs AI
games. We propose a network-based metric of piece-to-piece interaction to
quantify the ongoing strategic tension on the board. Its evolution in games
reveals that the most competitive AI players sustain higher levels of strategic
tension for longer durations than elite human players. Cumulative tension
varies with algorithmic complexity for AI and correspondingly in human-played
games increases abruptly with expertise at about 1600 Elo and again at 2300
Elo. The profiles reveal different approaches. Highly competitive AI tolerates
interconnected positions balanced between offensive and defensive tactics over
long periods. Human play, in contrast, limits tension and game complexity,
which may reflect cognitive limitations and adaptive strategies. The difference
may have implications for AI usage in complex, strategic environments.

Abstract: In large language model-based agents, memory serves as a critical capability
for achieving personalization by storing and utilizing users' information.
Although some previous studies have adopted memory to implement user
personalization, they typically focus on preference alignment and simple
question-answering. However, in the real world, complex tasks often require
multi-hop reasoning on a large amount of user information, which poses
significant challenges for current memory approaches. To address this
limitation, we propose the multi-hop personalized reasoning task to explore how
different memory mechanisms perform in multi-hop reasoning over personalized
information. We explicitly define this task and construct a dataset along with
a unified evaluation framework. Then, we implement various explicit and
implicit memory methods and conduct comprehensive experiments. We evaluate
their performance on this task from multiple perspectives and analyze their
strengths and weaknesses. Besides, we explore hybrid approaches that combine
both paradigms and propose the HybridMem method to address their limitations.
We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model through extensive
experiments. To benefit the research community, we release this project at

Conclusion: DIVE工作流和智能体设计可广泛应用于不同材料领域，为AI驱动的材料发现提供了新范式

Abstract: Data-driven artificial intelligence (AI) approaches are fundamentally
transforming the discovery of new materials. Despite the unprecedented
availability of materials data in the scientific literature, much of this
information remains trapped in unstructured figures and tables, hindering the
construction of large language model (LLM)-based AI agent for automated

organizes experimental data from graphical elements in scientific literatures.
We focus on solid-state hydrogen storage materials-a class of materials central
to future clean-energy technologies and demonstrate that DIVE markedly improves
the accuracy and coverage of data extraction compared to the direct extraction
by multimodal models, with gains of 10-15% over commercial models and over 30%
relative to open-source models. Building on a curated database of over 30,000
entries from 4,000 publications, we establish a rapid inverse design workflow
capable of identifying previously unreported hydrogen storage compositions in
two minutes. The proposed AI workflow and agent design are broadly transferable
across diverse materials, providing a paradigm for AI-driven materials
discovery.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了CardAIc-Agents多模态框架，通过外部工具和适应性理解来改善心血管疾病的自动化诊断，在三个数据集上表现超过了现有的视觉-语言模型和代理系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 心血管疾病是全球首要死因，但医疗工作者严重缺口。AI代理虽有潜力缓解这一问题，但临床应用受限于四个主要问题：基于提示的角色分配、固化工作流程、静态知识库以及固定的单/双模态输入输出。

Method: 设计了CardAIc-Agents多模态框架：1）CardiacRAG代理从可更新的心脏知识中生成通用计划；2）主代理集成工具自主执行计划并做出决策；3）步进更新策略根据执行结果动态优化计划；4）多学科讨论工具处理复杂案例；5）视觉审查面板支持最终验证。

Result: 在三个数据集上的实验表明，CardAIc-Agents在效率方面超过了主流视觉-语言模型、最先进的代理系统以及细调的视觉-语言模型。

Conclusion: CardAIc-Agents框架通过外部工具集成、适应性理解和多模态支持，有效解决了心血管AI诊断中的四大挑战，为临床应用提供了更灵活和高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) remain the foremost cause of mortality
worldwide, a burden worsened by a severe deficit of healthcare workers.
Artificial intelligence (AI) agents have shown potential to alleviate this gap
via automated early detection and proactive screening, yet their clinical
application remains limited by: 1) prompt-based clinical role assignment that
relies on intrinsic model capabilities without domain-specific tool support; or
2) rigid sequential workflows, whereas clinical care often requires adaptive
reasoning that orders specific tests and, based on their results, guides
personalised next steps; 3) general and static knowledge bases without
continuous learning capability; and 4) fixed unimodal or bimodal inputs and
lack of on-demand visual outputs when further clarification is needed. In
response, a multimodal framework, CardAIc-Agents, was proposed to augment
models with external tools and adaptively support diverse cardiac tasks.
Specifically, a CardiacRAG agent generated general plans from updatable cardiac
knowledge, while the chief agent integrated tools to autonomously execute these
plans and deliver decisions. To enable adaptive and case-specific
customization, a stepwise update strategy was proposed to dynamically refine
plans based on preceding execution results, once the task was assessed as
complex. In addition, a multidisciplinary discussion tool was introduced to
interpret challenging cases, thereby supporting further adaptation. When
clinicians raised concerns, visual review panels were provided to assist final
validation. Experiments across three datasets showed the efficiency of
CardAIc-Agents compared to mainstream Vision-Language Models (VLMs),
state-of-the-art agentic systems, and fine-tuned VLMs.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HiFo-Prompt框架通过前知和后见两种提示策略，解决了LLM基于进化计算的自动策略设计中的静态运算子和知识累积问题，显著提高了策略质量和收敛速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM基于进化计算框架中自动策略设计的效果受限于静态运算子和缺乏知识累积机制的问题。

Method: 提出HiFo-Prompt框架，采用前知和后见双重提示策略：前知提示根据群体动态调整搜索，后见提示从历史成功策略中提炼可重用设计原则。

Result: 实验结果显示HiFo-Prompt显著超过最先进的LLM基于AHD方法，能够生成更高质量策略，实现更快的收敛速度和更高的查询效率。

Conclusion: 该框架通过知识累积机制让LLM能够从自身经验中学习，将短暂发现转化为持久知识库，提高了自动策略设计的效果。

Abstract: LLM-based Automatic Heuristic Design (AHD) within Evolutionary Computation
(EC) frameworks has shown promising results. However, its effectiveness is
hindered by the use of static operators and the lack of knowledge accumulation
mechanisms. We introduce HiFo-Prompt, a framework that guides LLMs with two
synergistic prompting strategies: Foresight and Hindsight. Foresight-based
prompts adaptively steer the search based on population dynamics, managing the
exploration-exploitation trade-off. In addition, hindsight-based prompts mimic
human expertise by distilling successful heuristics from past generations into
fundamental, reusable design principles. This dual mechanism transforms
transient discoveries into a persistent knowledge base, enabling the LLM to
learn from its own experience. Empirical results demonstrate that HiFo-Prompt
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art LLM-based AHD methods, generating
higher-quality heuristics while achieving substantially faster convergence and
superior query efficiency.

*Ronit Virwani,Ruchika Suryawanshi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LOOP是一个新型的神经符号规划框架，通过神经网络和符号组件之间的迭代对话来解决复杂规划问题，在标准基准测试中达到85.8%的成功率，远超现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前最先进的神经规划方法在复杂领域中存在缺失前提条件、目标不一致和幻觉等问题，而传统符号规划器缺乏灵活性和自然语言理解能力。现有神经符号方法采用一次性翻译方式，未能充分利用神经和符号组件的协同优势。

Method: LOOP将规划视为神经和符号组件之间的迭代对话过程，集成了13个协调的神经特征，包括图神经网络处理空间关系、多智能体验证确保共识正确性、分层分解管理复杂任务，以及从成功和失败中学习的因果记忆。框架生成PDDL规范，基于符号反馈迭代优化，并从执行轨迹构建因果知识库。

Result: 在六个标准IPC基准领域评估中，LOOP达到85.8%的成功率，显著优于LLM+P（55.0%）、LLM-as-Planner（19.2%）和Tree-of-Thoughts（3.3%）等方法。

Conclusion: 可靠规划的关键不在于选择神经网络还是符号推理器，而在于让它们在整过程中真正"对话"。LOOP为构建可信赖的自主系统提供了完整蓝图，能够应对关键现实应用。

Abstract: Planning is one of the most critical tasks in autonomous systems, where even
a small error can lead to major failures or million-dollar losses. Current
state-of-the-art neural planning approaches struggle with complex domains,
producing plans with missing preconditions, inconsistent goals, and
hallucinations. While classical planners provide logical guarantees, they lack
the flexibility and natural language understanding capabilities needed for
modern autonomous systems. Existing neuro-symbolic approaches use one-shot
translation from natural language to formal plans, missing the opportunity for
neural and symbolic components to work and refine solutions together. To
address this gap, we develop LOOP -- a novel neuro-symbolic planning framework
that treats planning as an iterative conversation between neural and symbolic
components rather than simple translation. LOOP integrates 13 coordinated
neural features including graph neural networks for spatial relationships,
multi-agent validation for consensus-based correctness, hierarchical
decomposition for complex task management, and causal memory that learns from
both successes and failures. Unlike existing approaches, LOOP generates PDDL
specifications, refines them iteratively based on symbolic feedback, and builds
a causal knowledge base from execution traces. LOOP was evaluated on six
standard IPC benchmark domains, where it achieved 85.8% success rate compared
to LLM+P (55.0%), LLM-as-Planner (19.2%), and Tree-of-Thoughts (3.3%). This
work shows that the key to reliable planning is not in choosing between neural
networks or symbolic reasoners but it lies in making them actually ``talk'' to
each other during the entire process. LOOP provides a thorough blueprint for
building autonomous systems that can finally be trusted with critical
real-world applications.

*Thye Shan Ng,Caren Soyeon Han,Eun-Jung Holden*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SPANER是一个模态无关的参数高效微调框架，通过共享提示机制将不同模态输入嵌入到统一语义空间，提升跨模态泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态PEFT方法主要关注任务特定性能提升，但忽略了多模态嵌入空间的结构，导致模态特定表示孤立，限制了跨模态泛化能力。

Method: 提出SPANER框架，采用共享提示机制作为概念锚点，使语义相关的实例在空间中汇聚，支持无缝集成新模态而不改变核心架构。

Result: 在视觉-语言和音频-视觉基准测试中，SPANER展示了竞争力的少样本检索性能，同时保持了学习嵌入空间的高语义一致性。

Conclusion: 研究强调了对齐嵌入结构（而非仅仅调整适配器权重）对于可扩展多模态学习的重要性。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) have
significantly improved performance on downstream tasks such as few-shot
retrieval. However, most existing approaches focus on task-specific gains while
neglecting the structure of the multimodal embedding space. As a result,
modality-specific representations often remain isolated, limiting cross-modal
generalisation. In this work, we introduce Shared Prompt AligNER (SPANER), a
modality-agnostic PEFT framework designed to embed inputs from diverse
modalities into a unified semantic space. At its core, SPANER employs a shared
prompt mechanism that acts as a conceptual anchor, enabling semantically
related instances to converge spatially regardless of modality. This shared
prompt design is inherently extensible, supporting the seamless integration of
additional modalities, such as audio, without altering the core architecture.
Through comprehensive experiments across vision-language and audio-visual
benchmarks, SPANER demonstrates competitive few-shot retrieval performance
while preserving high semantic coherence in the learned embedding space. Our
results highlight the importance of aligning embedding structures, rather than
merely tuning adapter weights, for scalable multimodal learning.

*Nicole Cho,Kirsty Fielding,William Watson,Sumitra Ganesh,Manuela Veloso*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TASER是一个持续学习的智能表格提取系统，专门处理现实世界中高度非结构化、多页、异构的金融表格，通过模式引导的提取和推荐机制，在表格检测性能上超越现有模型10.1%，并能显著提升提取的资产持有量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实金融文档中的表格信息通常埋藏在混乱、多页、碎片化的表格中（99.4%的表格没有边界框），需要专门的技术来提取和规范化这些高度非结构化的金融持有信息。

Method: 开发了TASER系统，包含表格检测、分类、提取和推荐代理，利用初始模式执行提取，然后通过推荐代理审查输出、推荐模式修订并决定最终推荐，实现持续学习。

Result: TASER在表格检测上比Table Transformer提升10.1%；更大的批次大小使可操作的模式推荐增加104.3%，提取的资产持有量增加9.8%；构建了包含22,584页、3,213个表格、7310亿美元持有量的真实金融数据集。

Conclusion: 基于代理的模式引导提取系统在理解现实世界金融表格方面展现出巨大潜力，持续学习过程对提升提取性能至关重要。

Abstract: Real-world financial documents report essential information about an entity's
financial holdings that can span millions of different financial instrument
types. Yet, these details are often buried in messy, multi-page, fragmented
tables - for example, 99.4% of the tables in our dataset have no bounding boxes
with the maximum number of rows amounting to 426 per table across 44 pages. To
tackle these unique challenges from real-world tables, we present a
continuously learning, agentic table extraction system, TASER (Table Agents for
Schema-guided Extraction and Recommendation) that extracts highly unstructured,
multi-page, heterogeneous tables into normalized, schema-conforming outputs.
Our table agents execute on table detection, classification, extraction, and
recommendations by leveraging an initial schema. Then, our Recommender Agent
reviews the outputs, recommends schema revisions, and decides on the final
recommendations, enabling TASER to outperform existing table detection models
such as Table Transformer by 10.1%. Within this continuous learning process, we
highlight that larger batch sizes result in a 104.3% increase in schema
recommendations that are actionable and utilized, resulting in a 9.8% increase
in extracted holdings - highlighting the importance of a continuous learning
process. To train TASER, we have manually labeled 22,584 pages (28,150,449
tokens), 3,213 tables for $731,685,511,687 of holdings culminating in one of
the first real financial table datasets. We release our dataset TASERTab to
enable the research community to access real-world financial tables and
outputs. Our results highlight the promise of agentic, schema-guided extraction
systems for robust understanding of real-world financial tables.

Method: 基于领域无关的代理式AI系统，自主设计并执行了三个心理学实验（视觉工作记忆、心理旋转、想象生动性），进行线上数据收集和分析管道开发

Result: 系统成功进行了3个实验研究，收集了288名参与者的数据，开发了分析管道，并生成了完整的稿件，表现出与经验丰富研究者相可比的理论推理和方法论严谨性

Conclusion: 这是向能够通过实际实验测试假设的体现式AI进取的一步，能够自主探索人类认知和资源限制下无法涉足的科学领域，同时也提出了关于科学理解本质和科学豪動归属的重要问题

Abstract: Artificial intelligence systems are transforming scientific discovery by
accelerating specific research tasks, from protein structure prediction to
materials design, yet remain confined to narrow domains requiring substantial
human oversight. The exponential growth of scientific literature and increasing
domain specialisation constrain researchers' capacity to synthesise knowledge
across disciplines and develop unifying theories, motivating exploration of
more general-purpose AI systems for science. Here we show that a
domain-agnostic, agentic AI system can independently navigate the scientific
workflow - from hypothesis generation through data collection to manuscript
preparation. The system autonomously designed and executed three psychological
studies on visual working memory, mental rotation, and imagery vividness,
executed one new online data collection with 288 participants, developed
analysis pipelines through 8-hour+ continuous coding sessions, and produced
completed manuscripts. The results demonstrate the capability of AI scientific
discovery pipelines to conduct non-trivial research with theoretical reasoning
and methodological rigour comparable to experienced researchers, though with
limitations in conceptual nuance and theoretical interpretation. This is a step
toward embodied AI that can test hypotheses through real-world experiments,
accelerating discovery by autonomously exploring regions of scientific space
that human cognitive and resource constraints might otherwise leave unexplored.
It raises important questions about the nature of scientific understanding and
the attribution of scientific credit.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于Transformer的交通预测模型存在时间编码僵化和时空融合能力弱的问题，无法有效处理复杂的时空模式和多样化的输入格式。

Method: 提出STPFormer模型，包含四个核心模块：时间位置聚合器(TPA)用于模式感知时间编码、空间序列聚合器(SSA)用于序列空间学习、时空图匹配(STGM)用于跨域对齐、注意力混合器用于多尺度融合。

Result: 在五个真实世界数据集上的实验表明，STPFormer始终达到新的SOTA结果，消融实验和可视化验证了其有效性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: STPFormer通过统一的表示学习框架，有效解决了交通预测中的复杂时空模式建模问题，为时空数据建模提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Spatio-temporal traffic forecasting is challenging due to complex temporal
patterns, dynamic spatial structures, and diverse input formats. Although
Transformer-based models offer strong global modeling, they often struggle with
rigid temporal encoding and weak space-time fusion. We propose STPFormer, a
Spatio-Temporal Pattern-Aware Transformer that achieves state-of-the-art
performance via unified and interpretable representation learning. It
integrates four modules: Temporal Position Aggregator (TPA) for pattern-aware
temporal encoding, Spatial Sequence Aggregator (SSA) for sequential spatial
learning, Spatial-Temporal Graph Matching (STGM) for cross-domain alignment,
and an Attention Mixer for multi-scale fusion. Experiments on five real-world
datasets show that STPFormer consistently sets new SOTA results, with ablation
and visualizations confirming its effectiveness and generalizability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决具有最坏情况性能要求的广泛优化问题，提出一个上下文无关的数学形式来形式化这类问题

Method: 定义DMMV数学问题，分析其性质，开发GPU加速贫法汇算法，利用DMMV的数学特性加速求解过程

Result: 在语言模型量化中比现有方法提升15%；在离散断层成像中降低16%重建误差并加速6倍；在FIR滤波器设计中比Gurobi减少50%波红

Conclusion: DMMV作为一个上下文无关的优化问题形式具有广泛应用价值，提出的GPU加速贫法在多个领域都取得显著成效

Abstract: We introduce the Discrete Min-Max Violation (DMMV) as a general optimization
problem which seeks an assignment of discrete values to variables that
minimizes the largest constraint violation. This context-free mathematical
formulation is applicable to a wide range of use cases that have worst-case
performance requirements. After defining the DMMV problem mathematically, we
explore its properties to establish a foundational understanding. To tackle
DMMV instance sizes of practical relevance, we develop a GPU-accelerated
heuristic that takes advantage of the mathematical properties of DMMV for
speeding up the solution process. We demonstrate the versatile applicability of
our heuristic by solving three optimization problems as use cases: (1)
post-training quantization of language models, (2) discrete tomography, and (3)
Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filter design. In quantization without outlier
separation, our heuristic achieves 14% improvement on average over existing
methods. In discrete tomography, it reduces reconstruction error by 16% under
uniform noise and accelerates computations by a factor of 6 on GPU. For FIR
filter design, it nearly achieves 50% ripple reduction compared to using the
commercial integer optimization solver, Gurobi. Our comparative results point
to the benefits of studying DMMV as a context-free optimization problem and the
advantages that our proposed heuristic offers on three distinct problems. Our
GPU-accelerated heuristic will be made open-source to further stimulate
research on DMMV and its other applications. The code is available at

TL;DR: 研究发现语言模型代理存在风险意识与安全执行能力之间的显著差距，即使知道某些操作危险，在实际执行时仍会执行危险操作。作者开发了一个评估框架和风险验证系统，将危险操作执行率降低了55.3%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 语言模型代理在安全关键场景中存在严重风险，虽然它们具备风险知识，但在实际执行时无法有效识别和避免危险操作，这种差距需要系统性的研究和解决方案。

Method: 开发了包含三个维度的评估框架：风险知识、风险识别能力和安全行为执行。基于发现的性能差距，构建了风险验证器系统，包含抽象器将具体执行轨迹转换为抽象描述，使模型能更有效识别风险。

Result: 评估显示代理风险知识接近完美（>98%通过率），但实际风险识别能力下降23%，危险操作执行通过率低于26%。风险验证系统将危险操作执行率降低了55.3%。

Conclusion: 单纯扩展模型能力或推理计算无法解决安全问题，需要专门的安全机制。风险验证器系统能显著提升代理的安全性，为解决LM代理的安全问题提供了有效途径。

Abstract: Language model (LM) agents have demonstrated significant potential for
automating real-world tasks, yet they pose a diverse array of potential, severe
risks in safety-critical scenarios. In this work, we identify a significant gap
between LM agents' risk awareness and safety execution abilities: while they
often answer "Yes" to queries like "Is executing `sudo rm -rf /*' dangerous?",
they will likely fail to identify such risks in instantiated trajectories or
even directly perform these risky actions when acting as agents. To
systematically investigate this, we develop a comprehensive evaluation
framework to examine agents' safety across three progressive dimensions: 1)
their knowledge about potential risks, 2) their ability to identify
corresponding risks in execution trajectories, and 3) their actual behaviors to
avoid executing these risky actions. Our evaluation reveals two critical
performance gaps that resemble the generator-validator gaps observed in LMs:
while agents demonstrate near-perfect risk knowledge ($>98\%$ pass rates), they
fail to apply this knowledge when identifying risks in actual scenarios (with
performance dropping by $>23\%$) and often still execute risky actions ($<26\%$
pass rates). Notably, this trend persists across more capable LMs as well as in
specialized reasoning models like DeepSeek-R1, indicating that simply scaling
model capabilities or inference compute does not inherently resolve safety
concerns. Instead, we take advantage of these observed gaps to develop a risk
verifier that independently critiques the proposed actions by agents, with an
abstractor that converts specific execution trajectories into abstract
descriptions where LMs can more effectively identify the risks. Our overall
system achieves a significant reduction of risky action execution by $55.3\%$
over vanilla-prompted agents.

Abstract: Developing general-purpose embodied agents is a core challenge in AI.
Minecraft provides rich complexity and internet-scale data, but its slow speed
and engineering overhead make it unsuitable for rapid prototyping. Crafter
offers a lightweight alternative that retains key challenges from Minecraft,
yet its use has remained limited to narrow tasks due to the absence of
foundation models that have driven progress in the Minecraft setting. In this
paper, we present CrafterDojo, a suite of foundation models and tools that
unlock the Crafter environment as a lightweight, prototyping-friendly, and
Minecraft-like testbed for general-purpose embodied agent research. CrafterDojo
addresses this by introducing CrafterVPT, CrafterCLIP, and CrafterSteve-1 for
behavior priors, vision-language grounding, and instruction following,
respectively. In addition, we provide toolkits for generating behavior and
caption datasets (CrafterPlay and CrafterCaption), reference agent
implementations, benchmark evaluations, and a complete open-source codebase.

Motivation: 大语言模型在医疗文本理解方面表现出色，但在基于电子健康记录的预测任务中表现不佳，因为难以处理时间结构化和高维数据。现有方法通常依赖混合范式，未能提升大语言模型的内在推理能力。

Method: 提出EAG-RL两阶段训练框架：第一阶段使用专家引导的蒙特卡洛树搜索构建高质量逐步推理轨迹来初始化策略；第二阶段通过强化学习优化策略，使大语言模型的注意力与专家模型识别的临床显著特征对齐。

Conclusion: EAG-RL展示了在临床预测任务中实际部署的潜力，能够有效提升大语言模型在电子健康记录推理方面的性能。

Abstract: Improving large language models (LLMs) for electronic health record (EHR)
reasoning is essential for enabling accurate and generalizable clinical
predictions. While LLMs excel at medical text understanding, they underperform
on EHR-based prediction tasks due to challenges in modeling temporally
structured, high-dimensional data. Existing approaches often rely on hybrid
paradigms, where LLMs serve merely as frozen prior retrievers while downstream
deep learning (DL) models handle prediction, failing to improve the LLM's
intrinsic reasoning capacity and inheriting the generalization limitations of
DL models. To this end, we propose EAG-RL, a novel two-stage training framework
designed to intrinsically enhance LLMs' EHR reasoning ability through expert
attention guidance, where expert EHR models refer to task-specific DL models
trained on EHR data. Concretely, EAG-RL first constructs high-quality, stepwise
reasoning trajectories using expert-guided Monte Carlo Tree Search to
effectively initialize the LLM's policy. Then, EAG-RL further optimizes the
policy via reinforcement learning by aligning the LLM's attention with
clinically salient features identified by expert EHR models. Extensive
experiments on two real-world EHR datasets show that EAG-RL improves the
intrinsic EHR reasoning ability of LLMs by an average of 14.62%, while also
enhancing robustness to feature perturbations and generalization to unseen
clinical domains. These results demonstrate the practical potential of EAG-RL
for real-world deployment in clinical prediction tasks. Our code have been

Abstract: While reinforcement learning (RL) has proven highly effective for general

challenge, demanding complex reasoning over visual charts to generate
structured code. Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) alone is often insufficient,
highlighting the need for effective RL strategies that appropriately reward
structured outputs. We systematically investigate the performance plateau in
SFT through large-scale experiments and propose Multimodal Structured
Reinforcement Learning (MSRL) for chart-to-code generation, which substantially
breaks through this plateau. We construct the largest training corpus to date,
containing 3 million chart-code pairs from real-world arXiv tables to mitigate
simplistic patterns of prior synthetic data. Despite reaching state-of-the-art
performance, our experiments show that scaling SFT data eventually hits a
plateau where further increases yield negligible improvements. Our MSRL method
leverages a multi-granularity structured reward system using multimodal textual
and visual feedback. At the textual level, rule-based rewards validate
fine-grained code details. At the visual level, model-based rewards assess
structural similarity by rendering generated code into images and employing an
evaluator model. We implement this within a two-stage curriculum for training
stability. Results demonstrate that MSRL significantly breaks the SFT plateau,
improving high-level metrics by 6.2% and 9.9% on ChartMimic and ReachQA
benchmarks respectively, achieving competitive performance with advanced
closed-source models.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: V2P方法通过抑制注意力机制和基于Fitts定律的高斯热图建模，解决了GUI元素定位中的背景干扰和中心边缘区分问题，在ScreenSpot基准测试中达到92.3%和50.5%的准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统GUI元素定位方法忽视空间交互不确定性和视觉语义层次，现有注意力方法存在背景区域干扰导致注意力漂移，以及均匀标注无法区分目标UI元素中心与边缘导致点击不精确的问题。

Method: 提出Valley-to-Peak (V2P)方法：1) 抑制注意力机制最小化对无关区域的关注；2) 基于Fitts定律的2D高斯热图建模，权重从中心向边缘递减，方差由目标尺寸决定。

Result: 在ScreenSpot-v2和ScreenSpot-Pro两个基准测试中分别达到92.3%和50.5%的准确率，消融实验证实了各组件贡献。

Conclusion: V2P方法能有效隔离目标区域并让模型专注于UI元素最关键的点，具有精确GUI定位任务的泛化能力。

Abstract: Precise localization of GUI elements is crucial for the development of GUI
agents. Traditional methods rely on bounding box or center-point regression,
neglecting spatial interaction uncertainty and visual-semantic hierarchies.
Recent methods incorporate attention mechanisms but still face two key issues:
(1) ignoring processing background regions causes attention drift from the
desired area, and (2) uniform labeling fails to distinguish between center and
edges of the target UI element, leading to click imprecision. Inspired by how
humans visually process and interact with GUI elements, we propose the
Valley-to-Peak (V2P) method to address these issues. To mitigate background
distractions, V2P introduces a suppression attention mechanism that minimizes
the model's focus on irrelevant regions to highlight the intended region. For
the issue of center-edge distinction, V2P applies a Fitts' Law-inspired
approach by modeling GUI interactions as 2D Gaussian heatmaps where the weight
gradually decreases from the center towards the edges. The weight distribution
follows a Gaussian function, with the variance determined by the target's size.
Consequently, V2P effectively isolates the target area and teaches the model to
concentrate on the most essential point of the UI element. The model trained by
V2P achieves the performance with 92.3% and 50.5% on two benchmarks
ScreenSpot-v2 and ScreenSpot-Pro. Ablations further confirm each component's
contribution, highlighting V2P's generalizability for precise GUI grounding
tasks.

Motivation: 现有方法主要关注一阶逻辑形式化查询，但现实查询常涉及模糊或上下文相关的约束条件，如属性偏好或相关类别

Method: 提出神经查询重排序器(NQR)，通过交互式方式基于偏好和非偏好实体的增量示例来调整查询答案分数

Result: 扩展了现有QA基准测试，生成了包含软约束的数据集，实验表明NQR能有效捕获软约束同时保持稳健的查询回答性能

Conclusion: 该方法成功解决了知识图谱查询中软约束整合的问题，为处理现实世界中的模糊查询需求提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Methods for query answering over incomplete knowledge graphs retrieve
entities that are likely to be answers, which is particularly useful when such
answers cannot be reached by direct graph traversal due to missing edges.
However, existing approaches have focused on queries formalized using
first-order-logic. In practice, many real-world queries involve constraints
that are inherently vague or context-dependent, such as preferences for
attributes or related categories. Addressing this gap, we introduce the problem
of query answering with soft constraints. We propose a Neural Query Reranker
(NQR) designed to adjust query answer scores by incorporating soft constraints
without disrupting the original answers to a query. NQR operates interactively,
refining answers based on incremental examples of preferred and non-preferred
entities. We extend existing QA benchmarks by generating datasets with soft
constraints. Our experiments demonstrate that NQR can capture soft constraints
while maintaining robust query answering performance.

Motivation: LIME方法在训练数据有限时存在随机性和不稳定性问题，容易产生远离真实数据流形的样本，导致偏移模型无法准确近似原始模型的复杂决策边界

Method: 通过聚类将源域分成具有代表性原型的群集，获取与目标实例最相似的相关真实源实例，结合目标实例的邻近实例，使用对比学习编码器作为权重机制按与目标实例的接近程度分配权重

Conclusion: 将实例迁移学习与LIME框架相结合，通过利用相关源域的真实实例替代随机批疑，有效解决了数据稀缺情况下的解释不稳定性问题

Abstract: Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) methods, such as Local
Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME), have advanced the
interpretability of black-box machine learning models by approximating their
behavior locally using interpretable surrogate models. However, LIME's inherent
randomness in perturbation and sampling can lead to locality and instability
issues, especially in scenarios with limited training data. In such cases, data
scarcity can result in the generation of unrealistic variations and samples
that deviate from the true data manifold. Consequently, the surrogate model may
fail to accurately approximate the complex decision boundary of the original
model. To address these challenges, we propose a novel Instance-based Transfer
Learning LIME framework (ITL-LIME) that enhances explanation fidelity and
stability in data-constrained environments. ITL-LIME introduces instance
transfer learning into the LIME framework by leveraging relevant real instances
from a related source domain to aid the explanation process in the target
domain. Specifically, we employ clustering to partition the source domain into
clusters with representative prototypes. Instead of generating random
perturbations, our method retrieves pertinent real source instances from the
source cluster whose prototype is most similar to the target instance. These
are then combined with the target instance's neighboring real instances. To
define a compact locality, we further construct a contrastive learning-based
encoder as a weighting mechanism to assign weights to the instances from the
combined set based on their proximity to the target instance. Finally, these
weighted source and target instances are used to train the surrogate model for
explanation purposes.

Conclusion: 情境知识图谱具有独特的特征，需要专门设计的链接预测算法来处理其特殊性。

Abstract: Knowledge Graphs are used for various purposes, including business

paper, we investigate knowledge graphs describing household actions, which are
beneficial for controlling household robots and analyzing video footage. In the
latter case, the information extracted from videos is notoriously incomplete,
and completing the knowledge graph for enhancing the situational picture is
essential. In this paper, we show that, while a standard link prediction
problem, situational knowledge graphs have special characteristics that render
many link prediction algorithms not fit for the job, and unable to outperform
even simple baselines.

Conclusion: MHSNet能够有效解决简历重复检测中的挑战，包括语义复杂性、结构异构性和信息不完整性。

Abstract: To maintain the company's talent pool, recruiters need to continuously search
for resumes from third-party websites (e.g., LinkedIn, Indeed). However,
fetched resumes are often incomplete and inaccurate. To improve the quality of
third-party resumes and enrich the company's talent pool, it is essential to
conduct duplication detection between the fetched resumes and those already in
the company's talent pool. Such duplication detection is challenging due to the
semantic complexity, structural heterogeneity, and information incompleteness
of resume texts. To this end, we propose MHSNet, an multi-level identity
verification framework that fine-tunes BGE-M3 using contrastive learning. With
the fine-tuned , Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) generates multi-level sparse and
dense representations for resumes, enabling the computation of corresponding
multi-level semantic similarities. Moreover, the state-aware Mixture-of-Experts
(MoE) is employed in MHSNet to handle diverse incomplete resumes. Experimental
results verify the effectiveness of MHSNet

Motivation: 为了解决神经符号AI中不同表示和计算机制的复杂性，提供一个统一的抽象框架来简化和标准化神经符号系统的开发和实现。

Method: DeepLog包含两个关键组件：1）基于注释神经扩展的接地一阶逻辑语言，用于指定神经符号模型和推理任务；2）使用扩展代数电路作为计算图的计算层面。两者共同构成神经符号抽象机。

Abstract: We contribute a theoretical and operational framework for neurosymbolic AI
called DeepLog. DeepLog introduces building blocks and primitives for
neurosymbolic AI that make abstraction of commonly used representations and
computational mechanisms used in neurosymbolic AI. DeepLog can represent and
emulate a wide range of neurosymbolic systems. It consists of two key
components. The first is the DeepLog language for specifying neurosymbolic
models and inference tasks. This language consists of an annotated neural
extension of grounded first-order logic, and makes abstraction of the type of
logic, e.g. boolean, fuzzy or probabilistic, and whether logic is used in the
architecture or in the loss function. The second DeepLog component is situated
at the computational level and uses extended algebraic circuits as
computational graphs. Together these two components are to be considered as a
neurosymbolic abstract machine, with the DeepLog language as the intermediate
level of abstraction and the circuits level as the computational one. DeepLog
is implemented in software, relies on the latest insights in implementing
algebraic circuits on GPUs, and is declarative in that it is easy to obtain
different neurosymbolic models by making different choices for the underlying
algebraic structures and logics. The generality and efficiency of the DeepLog
neurosymbolic machine is demonstrated through an experimental comparison
between 1) different fuzzy and probabilistic logics, 2) between using logic in
the architecture or in the loss function, and 3) between a standalone CPU-based
implementation of a neurosymbolic AI system and a DeepLog GPU-based one.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CausalPlan是一个两阶段框架，通过将显式结构因果推理集成到LLM规划过程中，解决了小型开源LLM代理在协作任务中产生因果无效或不连贯动作的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型代理（尤其是较小的开源模型）在协作任务中经常产生因果无效或不连贯的动作，因为它们依赖表面相关性而非基于因果推理，这削弱了它们在动态环境中的协调和规划性能。

Method: 提出CausalPlan框架，包含结构因果行动（SCA）模型，从代理轨迹中学习因果图来捕捉先前行动和当前环境状态如何影响未来决策，然后使用该结构通过分配因果分数来指导行动选择。

Result: 在Overcooked-AI基准测试中，使用四种不同规模的LLM（Gemma-7B、Llama-8B、Qwen-14B和Llama-70B）进行实验，结果显示CausalPlan持续减少无效动作并改善AI-AI和人类-AI设置中的协作，优于强化学习基线。

Conclusion: 研究结果强调了因果驱动规划对于部署高效、可解释和可泛化的多智能体LLM系统的价值，无需对LLM本身进行微调即可约束规划到干预一致的行为。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) agents-especially smaller, open-source
models-often produce causally invalid or incoherent actions in collaborative
tasks due to their reliance on surface-level correlations rather than grounded
causal reasoning. This limitation undermines their performance in terms of
coordination and planning in dynamic environments. We address this challenge
with CausalPlan, a two-phase framework that integrates explicit structural
causal reasoning into the LLM planning process. At the core of CausalPlan is
the Structural Causal Action (SCA) model, which learns a causal graph from
agent trajectories to capture how prior actions and current environment states
influence future decisions. This structure is then used to guide action
selection by assigning causal scores to LLM-generated proposals, reweighting
them accordingly, or falling back to causally grounded alternatives when
needed. By embedding this causal knowledge directly into the decision loop,
CausalPlan constrains planning to intervention-consistent behaviours without
requiring fine-tuning of the LLM itself. We evaluate CausalPlan on the
Overcooked-AI benchmark across five multi-agent coordination tasks and four
LLMs of varying sizes: Gemma-7B, Llama-8B, Qwen-14B, and Llama-70B.
Experimental results show that CausalPlan consistently reduces invalid actions
and improves collaboration in both AI-AI and human-AI settings, outperforming
strong reinforcement learning baselines. Our findings highlight the value of
causality-driven planning for deploying efficient, interpretable, and
generalisable multi-agent LLM systems.

Method: 两阶段框架：1）基于公开语料构建LLM专业能力表进行专家代理动态选择；2）通过置信度融合和对抗验证进行多代理协作

Result: 在MMLU-Pro-Health数据集上达到74.45%准确率，比最佳闭源模型GPT-4-0613提升2.69%

Conclusion: EMRC框架通过专家感知的代理招募策略和代理互补性，有效利用了各LLM的专业能力，显著提升了医疗决策性能

Abstract: Medical Decision-Making (MDM) is a complex process requiring substantial
domain-specific expertise to effectively synthesize heterogeneous and
complicated clinical information. While recent advancements in Large Language
Models (LLMs) show promise in supporting MDM, single-LLM approaches are limited
by their parametric knowledge constraints and static training corpora, failing
to robustly integrate the clinical information. To address this challenge, we
propose the Expertise-aware Multi-LLM Recruitment and Collaboration (EMRC)
framework to enhance the accuracy and reliability of MDM systems. It operates
in two stages: (i) expertise-aware agent recruitment and (ii) confidence- and
adversarial-driven multi-agent collaboration. Specifically, in the first stage,
we use a publicly available corpus to construct an LLM expertise table for
capturing expertise-specific strengths of multiple LLMs across medical
department categories and query difficulty levels. This table enables the
subsequent dynamic selection of the optimal LLMs to act as medical expert
agents for each medical query during the inference phase. In the second stage,
we employ selected agents to generate responses with self-assessed confidence
scores, which are then integrated through the confidence fusion and adversarial
validation to improve diagnostic reliability. We evaluate our EMRC framework on
three public MDM datasets, where the results demonstrate that our EMRC
outperforms state-of-the-art single- and multi-LLM methods, achieving superior
diagnostic performance. For instance, on the MMLU-Pro-Health dataset, our EMRC
achieves 74.45% accuracy, representing a 2.69% improvement over the
best-performing closed-source model GPT- 4-0613, which demonstrates the
effectiveness of our expertise-aware agent recruitment strategy and the agent
complementarity in leveraging each LLM's specialized capabilities.

Abstract: Quantified formulas pose a significant challenge for Satisfiability Modulo
Theories (SMT) solvers due to their inherent undecidability. Existing
instantiation techniques, such as e-matching, syntax-guided, model-based,
conflict-based, and enumerative methods, often complement each other. This
paper introduces a novel instantiation approach that dynamically learns from
these techniques during solving. By treating observed instantiations as samples
from a latent language, we use probabilistic context-free grammars to generate
new, similar terms. Our method not only mimics successful past instantiations
but also explores diversity by optionally inverting learned term probabilities,
aiming to balance exploitation and exploration in quantifier reasoning.

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technology has been widely applied in
recent years. However, despite the emergence of various RAG frameworks, a
single RAG framework still cannot adapt well to a broad range of downstream
tasks. Therefore, how to leverage the advantages of multiple RAG systems has
become an area worth exploring. To address this issue, we have conducted a
comprehensive and systematic investigation into ensemble methods based on RAG
systems. Specifically, we have analyzed the RAG ensemble framework from both
theoretical and mechanistic analysis perspectives. From the theoretical
analysis, we provide the first explanation of the RAG ensemble framework from
the perspective of information entropy. In terms of mechanism analysis, we have
explored the RAG ensemble framework from both the pipeline and module levels.
We carefully select four different pipelines (Branching, Iterative, Loop, and
Agentic) and three different modules (Generator, Retriever, and Reranker) to
solve seven different research questions. The experiments show that aggregating
multiple RAG systems is both generalizable and robust, whether at the pipeline
level or the module level. Our work lays the foundation for similar research on
the multi-RAG system ensemble.

Abstract: LLMs have recently been used to generate Python programs representing
generalized plans in PDDL planning, i.e., plans that generalize across the
tasks of a given PDDL domain. Previous work proposed a framework consisting of
three steps: the LLM first generates a summary and then a strategy for the
domain, both in natural language, and then implements that strategy as a Python
program, that gets debugged on example planning tasks. In that work, only one
strategy is generated and passed directly to the program generation. If the
strategy is incorrect, its implementation will therefore result in an incorrect
generalized plan. Here, we introduce an approach that generates the strategy in
the form of pseudocode and enables automatic debugging of the pseudocode, hence
allowing us to identify and fix errors prior to the generation of the
generalized plan itself. Additionally, we extend the Python debugging phase
with a reflection step prompting the LLM to pinpoint the reason for the
observed plan failure. Finally, we take inspiration from LLM code generation to
produce several program variants and pick the best one. Running experiments on
17 benchmark domains, we show that these extensions substantially improve (and
never deteriorate) the quality of the generalized plans. In 12 of the domains,
our best Python programs solve all tasks that can be generated with the
respective instance generator.

Abstract: Time-series data is central to decision-making in financial markets, yet
building high-performing, interpretable, and auditable models remains a major
challenge. While Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) frameworks streamline
model development, they often lack adaptability and responsiveness to
domain-specific needs and evolving objectives. Concurrently, Large Language
Models (LLMs) have enabled agentic systems capable of reasoning, memory
management, and dynamic code generation, offering a path toward more flexible
workflow automation. In this paper, we introduce \textsf{TS-Agent}, a modular
agentic framework designed to automate and enhance time-series modeling
workflows for financial applications. The agent formalizes the pipeline as a
structured, iterative decision process across three stages: model selection,
code refinement, and fine-tuning, guided by contextual reasoning and
experimental feedback. Central to our architecture is a planner agent equipped
with structured knowledge banks, curated libraries of models and refinement
strategies, which guide exploration, while improving interpretability and
reducing error propagation. \textsf{TS-Agent} supports adaptive learning,
robust debugging, and transparent auditing, key requirements for high-stakes
environments such as financial services. Empirical evaluations on diverse
financial forecasting and synthetic data generation tasks demonstrate that
\textsf{TS-Agent} consistently outperforms state-of-the-art AutoML and agentic
baselines, achieving superior accuracy, robustness, and decision traceability.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究AI代理在经济环境中的新兴战略行为，特别是在多级供应链这种容易出现牛鞭效应等不稳定性的合作环境中。

Method: 使用大型语言模型驱动的生成式AI代理在受控供应链模拟中进行计算实验，设计包含高层AI驱动策略制定和低层协作执行协议的综合框架。

Result: 发现协作悖论现象，证明仅通过综合高层策略制定和低层执行协议才能实现弹性，最终框架能自主生成、评估和量化可行的战略选择组合。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了协作AI代理的新兴行为特征，为设计稳定有效的AI驱动商业分析系统提供了蓝图。

Abstract: The rise of autonomous, AI-driven agents in economic settings raises critical
questions about their emergent strategic behavior. This paper investigates
these dynamics in the cooperative context of a multi-echelon supply chain, a
system famously prone to instabilities like the bullwhip effect. We conduct
computational experiments with generative AI agents, powered by Large Language
Models (LLMs), within a controlled supply chain simulation designed to isolate
their behavioral tendencies. Our central finding is the "collaboration
paradox": a novel, catastrophic failure mode where theoretically superior
collaborative AI agents, designed with Vendor-Managed Inventory (VMI)
principles, perform even worse than non-AI baselines. We demonstrate that this
paradox arises from an operational flaw where agents hoard inventory, starving
the system. We then show that resilience is only achieved through a synthesis
of two distinct layers: high-level, AI-driven proactive policy-setting to
establish robust operational targets, and a low-level, collaborative execution
protocol with proactive downstream replenishment to maintain stability. Our
final framework, which implements this synthesis, can autonomously generate,
evaluate, and quantify a portfolio of viable strategic choices. The work
provides a crucial insight into the emergent behaviors of collaborative AI
agents and offers a blueprint for designing stable, effective AI-driven systems
for business analytics.

Motivation: 研究领先大语言模型是否能通过微调和定制，使其成为帮助专家有效使用PyChrono模拟工具的虚拟助手

Method: 提出了一个框架，用于微调和定制开源及闭源大语言模型，以生成PyChrono虚拟实验脚本，测量评估生成脚本质量的改善

Result: 微调后的模型在生成PyChrono模拟脚本质量上有显著提升，从简单单摆到复杂车辆变形地形模拟都能处理，虽然不完美但可作为良好起点

Conclusion: 该框架具有普遍性，可应用于其他领域的模拟工具，有效降低专家使用模拟工具的入门门槛

Abstract: This contribution is concerned with the following issue: can pretrained large
language models (LLMs) be refined and customized to the point where they become
virtual assistants helping experts with the effective use of a simulation tool?
In this case study, the ``simulation tool'' considered is PyChrono, an open
source multi-physics dynamics engine for multibody systems. We present a
framework for refining and customizing both open- and closed-source LLMs to
harness the power of AI in generating scripts that perform PyChrono virtual
experiments. We refine and customize several classes of LLMs through a process
that leads to a quantifiable improvement in the quality of the generated
PyChrono simulation scripts. These scripts can range from simple
single-pendulum simulations to complex virtual experiments involving full
vehicles on deformable terrain. While the generated scripts are rarely perfect,
they often serve as strong starting points for the user to modify and improve
on. Additionally, the LLM can answer specific API questions about the
simulator, or recommend modeling approaches. The framework discussed is general
and can be applied to lower the entry barrier for simulation tools associated
with other application domains.

Motivation: LRS问题是来自生物信息学的NP难组合优化问题，在基因组重新组装中发挥重要作用，需要高效的解决方案

Method: 采用Biased Random Key Genetic Algorithm (BRKGA)，重点关注个体评估的计算效率，将灰度值向量转换为有效解。同时开发了Max-Min Ant System作为对比方法，并使用CPLEX整数线性规划求解器

Abstract: The longest run subsequence (LRS) problem is an NP-hard combinatorial
optimization problem belonging to the class of subsequence problems from
bioinformatics. In particular, the problem plays a role in genome reassembly.
In this paper, we present a solution to the LRS problem using a Biased Random
Key Genetic Algorithm (BRKGA). Our approach places particular focus on the
computational efficiency of evaluating individuals, which involves converting
vectors of gray values into valid solutions to the problem. For comparison
purposes, a Max-Min Ant System is developed and implemented. This is in
addition to the application of the integer linear programming solver CPLEX for
solving all considered problem instances. The computation results show that the
proposed BRKGA is currently a state-of-the-art technique for the LRS problem.
Nevertheless, the results also show that there is room for improvement,
especially in the context of input strings based on large alphabet sizes.

Motivation: 解决机器代理在人类为中心的桌面环境中操作时的固有失配问题，并克服大规模端到端强化学习训练中的环境低效性和不稳定性挑战。

Method: 开发分布式RL基础设施协调数千个并行虚拟桌面环境，提出Entropulse训练策略（强化学习与监督微调交替进行），采用API-GUI统一范式。

Result: 在OSWorld基准测试中，基于GLM-4-9B-0414的AutoGLM-OS-9B实现了48.1%的最新最先进准确率，在桌面自动化通用代理方面取得显著改进。

Conclusion: ComputerRL框架通过创新的API-GUI范式和可扩展的训练基础设施，显著提升了桌面自动化代理的性能，为自主桌面智能提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce ComputerRL, a framework for autonomous desktop intelligence that
enables agents to operate complex digital workspaces skillfully. ComputerRL
features the API-GUI paradigm, which unifies programmatic API calls and direct
GUI interaction to address the inherent mismatch between machine agents and
human-centric desktop environments. Scaling end-to-end RL training is crucial
for improvement and generalization across diverse desktop tasks, yet remains
challenging due to environmental inefficiency and instability in extended
training. To support scalable and robust training, we develop a distributed RL
infrastructure capable of orchestrating thousands of parallel virtual desktop
environments to accelerate large-scale online RL. Furthermore, we propose
Entropulse, a training strategy that alternates reinforcement learning with
supervised fine-tuning, effectively mitigating entropy collapse during extended
training runs. We employ ComputerRL on open models GLM-4-9B-0414 and
Qwen2.5-14B, and evaluate them on the OSWorld benchmark. The AutoGLM-OS-9B
based on GLM-4-9B-0414 achieves a new state-of-the-art accuracy of 48.1%,
demonstrating significant improvements for general agents in desktop
automation. The algorithm and framework are adopted in building AutoGLM (Liu et

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种不确定性感知学习策略，通过同时学习医生的背景知识和肺部病变来提高医疗AI的诊断准确性和可信过程


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决医疗AI在肺癌诊断中因知识缺乏导致的诊断不确定性问题，提高医生对AI系统的信任度

Method: 使用阿洲大学医院提供的2,517张无病变图像和656张细结图像，实现了不确定性感知学习策略，同时学习医生背景知识和肺部病变信息

Result: 模型达到92%（IoU 0.2 / FPPI 2）的性能，敏感度比基准模型提高10%，不确定性测量指标熬象降低0.2

Conclusion: 通过学习医生的背景知识，可以有效减少医疗AI的诊断不确定性，提高诊断准确性和可靠性，促进医疗AI的临床应用

Abstract: Early detection and rapid intervention of lung cancer are crucial.
Nonetheless, ensuring an accurate diagnosis is challenging, as physicians'
ability to interpret chest X-rays varies significantly depending on their
experience and degree of fatigue. Although medical AI has been rapidly
advancing to assist in diagnosis, physicians' trust in such systems remains
limited, preventing widespread clinical adoption. This skepticism fundamentally
stems from concerns about its diagnostic uncertainty. In clinical diagnosis,
physicians utilize extensive background knowledge and clinical experience. In
contrast, medical AI primarily relies on repetitive learning of the target
lesion to generate diagnoses based solely on that data. In other words, medical
AI does not possess sufficient knowledge to render a diagnosis, leading to
diagnostic uncertainty. Thus, this study suggests an Uncertainty-Aware Learning
Policy that can address the issue of knowledge deficiency by learning the
physicians' background knowledge alongside the Chest X-ray lesion information.
We used 2,517 lesion-free images and 656 nodule images, all obtained from Ajou
University Hospital. The proposed model attained 92% (IoU 0.2 / FPPI 2) with a
10% enhancement in sensitivity compared to the baseline model while also
decreasing entropy as a measure of uncertainty by 0.2.

Motivation: 解决图表视觉问答这一自然语言理解中的挑战性子任务，需要模型同时处理视觉和语言信息

Method: 开发了基于VisualBERT架构的BERT-VQA模型，使用预训练的ResNet 101图像编码器，并可能加入联合融合模块，与LSTM+CNN+浅层分类器的基线模型进行对比

Result: 最终结果推翻了核心假设，证明VisualBERT的跨模态模块在图表组件与问题短语对齐方面并非必需，基线模型表现更好

Conclusion: 这项工作揭示了图表问答任务的难度，并为不同模型架构在此问题上的适用性提供了宝贵见解

Abstract: Visual question answering has been an exciting challenge in the field of
natural language understanding, as it requires deep learning models to exchange
information from both vision and language domains. In this project, we aim to
tackle a subtask of this problem, namely visual question answering on plots. To
achieve this, we developed BERT-VQA, a VisualBERT-based model architecture with
a pretrained ResNet 101 image encoder, along with a potential addition of joint
fusion. We trained and evaluated this model against a baseline that consisted
of a LSTM, a CNN, and a shallow classifier. The final outcome disproved our
core hypothesis that the cross-modality module in VisualBERT is essential in
aligning plot components with question phrases. Therefore, our work provided
valuable insights into the difficulty of the plot question answering challenge
as well as the appropriateness of different model architectures in solving this
problem.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代神经网络在大型数据集上训练的计算和环境成本很高，需要一种高效的方法来减少训练资源消耗。

Method: 提取每批的低秩特征表示，应用Fast MaxVol采样器选择覆盖主导子空间的小型多样化子集，使用梯度近似准则动态调整子集大小。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，GRAFT在准确性和效率方面匹配或超过了最近的基线方法，在准确性、效率和排放之间提供了有利的权衡。

Conclusion: GRAFT通过低秩子空间操作和精心选择的样本训练，能够在减少墙钟时间、能耗和CO2排放的同时保持训练轨迹。

Abstract: Training modern neural networks on large datasets is computationally and
environmentally costly. We introduce GRAFT, a scalable in-training subset
selection method that (i) extracts a low-rank feature representation for each
batch, (ii) applies a Fast MaxVol sampler to select a small, diverse subset
that spans the batch's dominant subspace, and (iii) dynamically adjusts the
subset size using a gradient-approximation criterion. By operating in low-rank
subspaces and training on carefully chosen examples instead of full batches,
GRAFT preserves the training trajectory while reducing wall-clock time, energy
consumption, and $\mathrm{CO}_2$ emissions. Across multiple benchmarks, GRAFT
matches or exceeds recent selection baselines in both accuracy and efficiency,
providing a favorable trade-off between accuracy, efficiency, and emissions.

Motivation: 在自然灾害期间，准确理解公众情感对有效的危机管理至关重要。传统方法将文本和图像模态分别处理，无法充分利用多模态数据之间的关联性。

Method: 采用CNN进行图像分析和LLM（GPT）进行文本处理，通过提示工程提取情感相关特征。设计了上下文注意力机制来模型模态间关系，使用深度神经网络学习融合后的特征。

Result: 在CrisisMMD数据集上进行实验，模型在社交媒体数据分类中显著提升了性能，准确率提高2.43%，F1值提高5.18%，在多种自然灾害场景下都取得了较好效果。

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel approach for multimodal sentiment analysis on
social media, particularly in the context of natural disasters, where
understanding public sentiment is crucial for effective crisis management.
Unlike conventional methods that process text and image modalities separately,
our approach seamlessly integrates Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based
image analysis with Large Language Model (LLM) based text processing,
leveraging Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) and prompt engineering to
extract sentiment relevant features from the CrisisMMD dataset. To effectively
model intermodal relationships, we introduce a contextual attention mechanism
within the fusion process. Leveraging contextual-attention layers, this
mechanism effectively captures intermodality interactions, enhancing the
model's comprehension of complex relationships between textual and visual data.
The deep neural network architecture of our model learns from these fused
features, leading to improved accuracy compared to existing baselines.
Experimental results demonstrate significant advancements in classifying social
media data into informative and noninformative categories across various
natural disasters. Our model achieves a notable 2.43% increase in accuracy and
5.18% in F1-score, highlighting its efficacy in processing complex multimodal
data. Beyond quantitative metrics, our approach provides deeper insight into
the sentiments expressed during crises. The practical implications extend to
real time disaster management, where enhanced sentiment analysis can optimize
the accuracy of emergency interventions. By bridging the gap between multimodal
analysis, LLM powered text understanding, and disaster response, our work
presents a promising direction for Artificial Intelligence (AI) driven crisis
management solutions. Keywords:

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种可微分的量化神经网络训练方法，通过可学习的比特宽度、噪声尺度和钳位边界，结合外部点惩罚和目标比特宽度约束，在极低比特量化（W1A1）下保持竞争力的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量化神经网络可以看作是一系列噪声信道链，随着比特宽度减小，舍入操作会降低网络容量。研究旨在解决量化过程中出现的瓶颈问题，通过将微调建模为平滑的约束优化问题来跟踪容量动态。

Method: 使用完全可微分的直通估计器（STE），包含可学习的比特宽度、噪声尺度和钳位边界。通过外部点惩罚强制执行目标比特宽度约束，并采用蒸馏进行轻度度量平滑以稳定训练。

Result: 尽管方法简单，但在极端W1A1设置下仍能获得具有竞争力的准确率，同时保持了STE的效率优势。

Conclusion: 该方法成功地将量化神经网络训练转化为约束优化问题，通过可学习参数和稳定化技术，在极低比特量化场景下实现了性能与效率的良好平衡。

Abstract: Quantized neural networks can be viewed as a chain of noisy channels, where
rounding in each layer reduces capacity as bit-width shrinks; the
floating-point (FP) checkpoint sets the maximum input rate. We track capacity
dynamics as the average bit-width decreases and identify resulting quantization
bottlenecks by casting fine-tuning as a smooth, constrained optimization
problem. Our approach employs a fully differentiable Straight-Through Estimator
(STE) with learnable bit-width, noise scale and clamp bounds, and enforces a
target bit-width via an exterior-point penalty; mild metric smoothing (via
distillation) stabilizes training. Despite its simplicity, the method attains
competitive accuracy down to the extreme W1A1 setting while retaining the
efficiency of STE.

Conclusion: 训练点分布是影响PINNs性能的关键因素，需要根据具体微分方程的特性来选择合适的分布策略。

Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks approach the approximation of differential
equations by directly incorporating their structure and given conditions in a
loss function. This enables conditions like, e.g., invariants to be easily
added during the modelling phase. In addition, the approach can be considered
as mesh free and can be utilised to compute solutions on arbitrary grids after
the training phase. Therefore, physics-informed neural networks are emerging as
a promising alternative to solving differential equations with methods from
numerical mathematics. However, their performance highly depends on a large
variety of factors. In this paper, we systematically investigate and evaluate a
core component of the approach, namely the training point distribution. We test
two ordinary and two partial differential equations with five strategies for
training data generation and shallow network architectures, with one and two
hidden layers. In addition to common distributions, we introduce sine-based
training points, which are motivated by the construction of Chebyshev nodes.
The results are challenged by using certain parameter combinations like, e.g.,
random and fixed-seed weight initialisation for reproducibility. The results
show the impact of the training point distributions on the solution accuracy
and we find evidence that they are connected to the characteristics of the
differential equation.

Result: 在三个公共数据集上的实验表明，DGNPP在事件预测和时间预测任务上均取得优越性能，高效且显著优于基线模型

Conclusion: DGNPP有效解决了先前方法的局限性，通过结合拓扑结构和时序动态性，为时间交互网络学习提供了更全面的建模框架

Abstract: Learning temporal interaction networks(TIN) is previously regarded as a
coarse-grained multi-sequence prediction problem, ignoring the network topology
structure influence. This paper addresses this limitation and a Deep Graph
Neural Point Process(DGNPP) model for TIN is proposed. DGNPP consists of two
key modules: the Node Aggregation Layer and the Self Attentive Layer. The Node
Aggregation Layer captures topological structures to generate static
representation for users and items, while the Self Attentive Layer dynamically
updates embeddings over time. By incorporating both dynamic and static
embeddings into the event intensity function and optimizing the model via
maximum likelihood estimation, DGNPP predicts events and occurrence time
effectively. Experimental evaluations on three public datasets demonstrate that
DGNPP achieves superior performance in event prediction and time prediction
tasks with high efficiency, significantly outperforming baseline models and
effectively mitigating the limitations of prior approaches.

Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在复杂图像标注任务中存在推理能力不足的问题，标准监督微调只关注标注结果而忽略推理过程，视觉强化微调由于缺乏高质量验证思维链导致推理不一致

Method: 两阶段框架：1) RISE-CoT阶段使用强化学习驱动的"标注-推理-标注"闭环生成视觉基础的逻辑一致思维链；2) RISE-R1阶段利用高质量CoT子集进行监督微调，然后进行强化微调

Result: 在复杂和简单图像标注任务上，RISE训练的Qwen2-VL-2B模型超越了SFT和Visual-RFT方法，实现了鲁棒性能和增强的可解释性

Conclusion: RISE提供了一种无需人工标注思维链的自监督解决方案，能够有效提升视觉语言模型的推理能力

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) struggle with complex image annotation tasks,
such as emotion classification and context-driven object detection, which
demand sophisticated reasoning. Standard Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) focuses
solely on annotation outcomes, ignoring underlying rationales, while Visual
Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (Visual-RFT) produces inconsistent Chains of Thought
(CoTs) due to the absence of high-quality, verified CoTs during pre-training.
We introduce RISE (Reason-Inspire-Strengthen-Expertise), a two-stage framework
to overcome these limitations. In the Reason stage (RISE-CoT), a reinforcement
learning-driven "annotation-reasoning-annotation" closed-loop generates
visually grounded, logically consistent CoTs by verifying their ability to
reconstruct original annotations without direct leakage. The Inspire and
Strengthen stage (RISE-R1) leverages a high-quality CoT subset, filtered by
RISE-CoT rewards, for supervised fine-tuning, followed by reinforcement
fine-tuning to produce interpretable reasoning and accurate annotations,
achieving Expertise in complex visual tasks. Evaluated on complex and simple
image annotation tasks, RISE-trained Qwen2-VL-2B outperforms SFT and
Visual-RFT, achieving robust performance and enhanced explainability. RISE
offers a self-supervised solution for advancing VLM reasoning without requiring
manually annotated CoTs.

Abstract: Discovering the governing equations of a physical system and designing an
effective feedback controller remains one of the most challenging and intensive
areas of ongoing research. This task demands a deep understanding of the system
behavior, including the nonlinear factors that influence its dynamics. In this
article, we propose a novel methodology for identifying a feedback linearized
physical system based on known prior dynamic behavior. Initially, the system is
identified using a sparse regression algorithm, subsequently a feedback
controller is designed for the discovered system by applying Lie derivatives to
the dictionary of output functions to derive an augmented constraint which
guarantees that no internal dynamics are observed. Unlike the prior related
works, the novel aspect of this article combines the approach of stacked
regression algorithm and relative degree conditions to discover and feedback
linearize the true governing equations of a physical model.

Abstract: The scarcity of high-quality labeled data in sensor-based Human Activity
Recognition (HAR) hinders model performance and limits generalization across
real-world scenarios. Data augmentation is a key strategy to mitigate this
issue by enhancing the diversity of training datasets. Signal
Transformation-based Data Augmentation (STDA) techniques have been widely used
in HAR. However, these methods are often physically implausible, potentially
resulting in augmented data that fails to preserve the original meaning of the
activity labels. In this study, we introduce and systematically characterize
Physically Plausible Data Augmentation (PPDA) enabled by physics simulation.
PPDA leverages human body movement data from motion capture or video-based pose
estimation and incorporates various realistic variabilities through physics
simulation, including modifying body movements, sensor placements, and
hardware-related effects. We compare the performance of PPDAs with traditional
STDAs on three public datasets of daily activities and fitness workouts. First,
we evaluate each augmentation method individually, directly comparing PPDAs to
their STDA counterparts. Next, we assess how combining multiple PPDAs can
reduce the need for initial data collection by varying the number of subjects
used for training. Experiments show consistent benefits of PPDAs, improving
macro F1 scores by an average of 3.7 pp (up to 13 pp) and achieving competitive
performance with up to 60% fewer training subjects than STDAs. As the first
systematic study of PPDA in sensor-based HAR, these results highlight the
advantages of pursuing physical plausibility in data augmentation and the
potential of physics simulation for generating synthetic Inertial Measurement
Unit data for training deep learning HAR models. This cost-effective and
scalable approach therefore helps address the annotation scarcity challenge in
HAR.

TL;DR: 一种协作式匹配系统comatch，通过选择性延迟算法最有信心的决策给人类，实现人工智能补充性，在大规模人类实验中显著提升了匹配性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Method: 提出co-match协作匹配系统，系统只选择自身最有信心的匹配决策，将其余决策延迟给人类决策者，并优化决策分配以最大化性能。

Result: 在800名参与者的大规模人类实验中，comatch产生的匹配结果超过了单独使用人类或算法的表现。

Conclusion: 协作式匹配系统能够有效实现人工智能补充性，在高风险应用领域具有重要价值。

Abstract: Data-driven algorithmic matching systems promise to help human decision
makers make better matching decisions in a wide variety of high-stakes
application domains, such as healthcare and social service provision. However,
existing systems are not designed to achieve human-AI complementarity:
decisions made by a human using an algorithmic matching system are not
necessarily better than those made by the human or by the algorithm alone. Our
work aims to address this gap. To this end, we propose collaborative matching
(comatch), a data-driven algorithmic matching system that takes a collaborative
approach: rather than making all the matching decisions for a matching task
like existing systems, it selects only the decisions that it is the most
confident in, deferring the rest to the human decision maker. In the process,
comatch optimizes how many decisions it makes and how many it defers to the
human decision maker to provably maximize performance. We conduct a large-scale
human subject study with $800$ participants to validate the proposed approach.
The results demonstrate that the matching outcomes produced by comatch
outperform those generated by either human participants or by algorithmic
matching on their own. The data gathered in our human subject study and an
implementation of our system are available as open source at
https://github.com/Networks-Learning/human-AI-complementarity-matching.

TL;DR: 本文提出了层次化共形分类（HCC），将类别层次结构融入共形预测框架，在保持覆盖保证的同时生成包含不同层次节点的预测集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准共形预测将类别视为扁平无结构的，忽略了类别间的语义关系或层次结构等领域知识。

Method: 将HCC建模为约束优化问题，通过数学证明发现只需考虑较小且结构良好的候选解子集即可确保覆盖性和最优性。

Result: 在音频、图像和文本数据三个新基准上的实证评估显示该方法的优势，用户研究表明标注者显著偏好层次化预测集。

Conclusion: HCC成功将类别层次结构整合到共形预测中，在保持理论保证的同时提供了更具语义意义的预测集。

Abstract: Conformal prediction (CP) is a powerful framework for quantifying uncertainty
in machine learning models, offering reliable predictions with finite-sample
coverage guarantees. When applied to classification, CP produces a prediction
set of possible labels that is guaranteed to contain the true label with high
probability, regardless of the underlying classifier. However, standard CP
treats classes as flat and unstructured, ignoring domain knowledge such as
semantic relationships or hierarchical structure among class labels. This paper
presents hierarchical conformal classification (HCC), an extension of CP that
incorporates class hierarchies into both the structure and semantics of
prediction sets. We formulate HCC as a constrained optimization problem whose
solutions yield prediction sets composed of nodes at different levels of the
hierarchy, while maintaining coverage guarantees. To address the combinatorial
nature of the problem, we formally show that a much smaller, well-structured
subset of candidate solutions suffices to ensure coverage while upholding
optimality. An empirical evaluation on three new benchmarks consisting of
audio, image, and text data highlights the advantages of our approach, and a
user study shows that annotators significantly prefer hierarchical over flat
prediction sets.

Abstract: We consider the problem of generating samples via Flow Matching (FM) with an
additional requirement that the generated samples must satisfy given
constraints. We consider two scenarios, viz.: (a) when a differentiable
distance function to the constraint set is given, and (b) when the constraint
set is only available via queries to a membership oracle. For case (a), we
propose a simple adaptation of the FM objective with an additional term that
penalizes the distance between the constraint set and the generated samples.
For case (b), we propose to employ randomization and learn a mean flow that is
numerically shown to have a high likelihood of satisfying the constraints. This
approach deviates significantly from existing works that require simple convex
constraints, knowledge of a barrier function, or a reflection mechanism to
constrain the probability flow. Furthermore, in the proposed setting we show
that a two-stage approach, where both stages approximate the same original flow
but with only the second stage probing the constraints via randomization, is
more computationally efficient. Through several synthetic cases of constrained
generation, we numerically show that the proposed approaches achieve
significant gains in terms of constraint satisfaction while matching the target
distributions. As a showcase for a practical oracle-based constraint, we show
how our approach can be used for training an adversarial example generator,
using queries to a hard-label black-box classifier. We conclude with several
future research directions. Our code is available at

<details>

Motivation: 传统机器语言学习通常假设完全可观测性，但现实中学习者往往无法直接获取所有相关信息。论文旨在解决这种部分可观测性带来的挑战，使语言学习更贴近真实场景。

Conclusion: 部分可观测性是语言学习中的重要挑战，通过环境推理和消息分析的方法可以有效解决这一问题，为更真实的语言学习场景提供了理论基础和实用算法。

Abstract: Machine language acquisition is often presented as a problem of imitation
learning: there exists a community of language users from which a learner
observes speech acts and attempts to decode the mappings between utterances and
situations. However, an interesting consideration that is typically unaddressed
is partial observability, i.e. the learner is assumed to see all relevant
information. This paper explores relaxing this assumption, thereby posing a
more challenging setting where such information needs to be inferred from
knowledge of the environment, the actions taken, and messages sent. We see
several motivating examples of this problem, demonstrate how they can be solved
in a toy setting, and formally explore challenges that arise in more general
settings. A learning-based algorithm is then presented to perform the decoding
of private information to facilitate language acquisition.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种基于动态图创建和空间时间注意力机制的新框架，用于学习fMRI数据的空时关系并进行自闭谱障碍(ASD)诊断，在ABIDE数据集上超越了静态图方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的fMRI分类方法主要基于静态功能连通性，无法全面抓取空间时间关系，而神经活动动态很复杂，需要更好的方法来理解和分析。

Method: 使用基于transformer的注意力机制动态推断大脑功能连通性，构建时间变化图，然后通过图卷积网络(GCN)和transformer处理，抓取局部交互和全局时间依赖关系。

Result: 在ABIDE数据集子集上达到了63.2%的准确率和60.0%的AUC，显著超过静态图方法(GCN:51.8%)。

Conclusion: 这个方法验证了联合建模动态连通性和空时上下文对fMRI分类的效果，核心新颖性在于注意力驱动的动态图创建和通过GCN-transformer融合的层次空时特征融合。

Abstract: Understanding the complex neural activity dynamics is crucial for the
development of the field of neuroscience. Although current functional MRI
classification approaches tend to be based on static functional connectivity or
cannot capture spatio-temporal relationships comprehensively, we present a new
framework that leverages dynamic graph creation and spatiotemporal attention
mechanisms for Autism Spectrum Disorder(ASD) diagnosis. The approach used in
this research dynamically infers functional brain connectivity in each time
interval using transformer-based attention mechanisms, enabling the model to
selectively focus on crucial brain regions and time segments. By constructing
time-varying graphs that are then processed with Graph Convolutional Networks
(GCNs) and transformers, our method successfully captures both localized
interactions and global temporal dependencies. Evaluated on the subset of ABIDE
dataset, our model achieves 63.2 accuracy and 60.0 AUC, outperforming static
graph-based approaches (e.g., GCN:51.8). This validates the efficacy of joint
modeling of dynamic connectivity and spatio-temporal context for fMRI
classification. The core novelty arises from (1) attention-driven dynamic graph
creation that learns temporal brain region interactions and (2) hierarchical
spatio-temporal feature fusion through GCNtransformer fusion.

TL;DR: X-MoE是一个专为下一代MoE架构设计的新型训练系统，通过多项创新技术解决了现有MoE训练在非NVIDIA平台上的性能瓶颈，在AMD GPU上实现了5450亿参数模型的规模化训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的专家混合模型（MoE）架构如DeepSeek-MoE虽然模型质量优秀，但在扩展性方面存在严重限制：激活内存开销大、全互联通信成本高，且现有训练系统主要针对NVIDIA GPU优化，在非NVIDIA平台上性能不佳，浪费了大量计算潜力。

Method: X-MoE采用多项创新技术：1）跨平台内核的无填充高效MoE训练；2）冗余旁路调度机制；3）序列分片MoE块的混合并行策略。这些技术共同解决了内存和通信瓶颈。

Result: 在基于AMD MI250X GPU的Frontier超级计算机上评估显示，X-MoE能够在1024个GPU上扩展到5450亿参数的DeepSeek风格MoE模型，比现有方法在相同硬件预算下可训练的模型大10倍，同时保持高训练吞吐量。

Conclusion: X-MoE成功解决了下一代MoE架构的规模化训练挑战，为非NVIDIA平台上的大规模MoE模型训练提供了高效解决方案，显著提升了训练效率和模型规模上限。

Abstract: Emerging expert-specialized Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architectures, such as
DeepSeek-MoE, deliver strong model quality through fine-grained expert
segmentation and large top-k routing. However, their scalability is limited by
substantial activation memory overhead and costly all-to-all communication.
Furthermore, current MoE training systems - primarily optimized for NVIDIA GPUs
- perform suboptimally on non-NVIDIA platforms, leaving significant
computational potential untapped. In this work, we present X-MoE, a novel MoE
training system designed to deliver scalable training performance for
next-generation MoE architectures. X-MoE achieves this via several novel
techniques, including efficient padding-free MoE training with cross-platform
kernels, redundancy-bypassing dispatch, and hybrid parallelism with
sequence-sharded MoE blocks. Our evaluation on the Frontier supercomputer,
powered by AMD MI250X GPUs, shows that X-MoE scales DeepSeek-style MoEs up to
545 billion parameters across 1024 GPUs - 10x larger than the largest trainable
model with existing methods under the same hardware budget, while maintaining
high training throughput. The source code of X-MoE is available at

Abstract: Predicting counterfactual distributions in complex dynamical systems is
essential for scientific modeling and decision-making in domains such as public
health and medicine. However, existing methods often rely on point estimates or
purely data-driven models, which tend to falter under data scarcity. We propose
a time series diffusion-based framework that incorporates guidance from
imperfect expert models by extracting high-level signals to serve as structured
priors for generative modeling. Our method, ODE-Diff, bridges mechanistic and
data-driven approaches, enabling more reliable and interpretable causal
inference. We evaluate ODE-Diff across semi-synthetic COVID-19 simulations,
synthetic pharmacological dynamics, and real-world case studies, demonstrating
that it consistently outperforms strong baselines in both point prediction and
distributional accuracy.

Motivation: 现有轨迹预测方法生成的集合路径通常未校准，缺乏理论覆盖保证，需要提供可靠的不确定性估计

Result: 能够自然捕捉时间依赖性，产生更尖锐、更自适应的不确定性估计

Conclusion: 该框架为轨迹预测提供了理论保证的校准方法，改进了不确定性量化

Abstract: Future trajectories play an important role across domains such as autonomous
driving, hurricane forecasting, and epidemic modeling, where practitioners
commonly generate ensemble paths by sampling probabilistic models or leveraging
multiple autoregressive predictors. While these trajectories reflect inherent
uncertainty, they are typically uncalibrated. We propose a unified framework
based on conformal prediction that transforms sampled trajectories into
calibrated prediction intervals with theoretical coverage guarantees. By
introducing a novel online update step and an optimization step that captures
inter-step dependencies, our method can produce discontinuous prediction
intervals around each trajectory, naturally capture temporal dependencies, and
yield sharper, more adaptive uncertainty estimates.

Conclusion: J3O框架能够在内存、计算和通信约束下有效地管理多任务投揸工作负荷，实现高准确性和高效性的协同推理。

Abstract: The growing demand for intelligent services on resource-constrained edge
devices has spurred the development of collaborative inference systems that
distribute workloads across end devices, edge servers, and the cloud. While
most existing frameworks focus on single-task, single-model scenarios, many
real-world applications (e.g., autonomous driving and augmented reality)
require concurrent execution of diverse tasks including detection,
segmentation, and depth estimation. In this work, we propose a unified
framework to jointly decide which multi-task models to deploy (onload) at
clients and edge servers, and how to route queries across the hierarchy
(offload) to maximize overall inference accuracy under memory, compute, and
communication constraints. We formulate this as a mixed-integer program and
introduce J3O (Joint Optimization of Onloading and Offloading), an alternating
algorithm that (i) greedily selects models to onload via Lagrangian-relaxed
submodular optimization and (ii) determines optimal offloading via constrained
linear programming. We further extend J3O to account for batching at the edge,
maintaining scalability under heterogeneous task loads. Experiments show J3O
consistently achieves over $97\%$ of the optimal accuracy while incurring less
than $15\%$ of the runtime required by the optimal solver across multi-task
benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一个定量框架来评估临床定义的癫痫发作起始区(SOZ)与通过chirp事件时间频率分析识别的统计异常通道之间的空间一致性，为癫痫手术定位提供更可靠的辅助方法。

Method: 采用两步法：1)无监督异常检测-使用局部异常因子(LOF)分析和自适应邻域选择基于chirp的频谱时域特征识别异常通道；2)空间相关性分析-计算精确共现度量和加权指数相似性，包含半球一致性和电极邻近性。

Result: LOF方法(N=20, contamination=0.2)有效检测异常，加权指数匹配在SOZ定位中优于精确匹配。无癫痫发作患者(指数精度均值:0.903)和手术成功患者(指数精度均值:0.865)性能最佳，失败病例一致性较低(指数精度均值:0.460)。

Conclusion: 基于chirp的异常检测结合加权空间度量为SOZ定位提供了有效的补充方法，特别是在手术结果成功的患者中表现出良好的临床应用潜力。

Abstract: This study presents a quantitative framework for evaluating the spatial
concordance between clinically defined seizure onset zones (SOZs) and
statistically anomalous channels identified through time-frequency analysis of
chirp events. The proposed pipeline employs a two-step methodology: (1)
Unsupervised Outlier Detection, where Local Outlier Factor (LOF) analysis with
adaptive neighborhood selection identifies anomalous channels based on
spectro-temporal features of chirp (Onset frequency, offset frequency, and
temporal duration); and (2) Spatial Correlation Analysis, which computes both
exact co-occurrence metrics and weighted index similarity, incorporating
hemispheric congruence and electrode proximity. Key findings demonstrate that
the LOF-based approach (N neighbors=20, contamination=0.2) effectively detects
outliers, with index matching (weighted by channel proximity) outperforming
exact matching in SOZ localization. Performance metrics (precision, recall, F1)
were highest for seizure-free patients (Index Precision mean: 0.903) and those
with successful surgical outcomes (Index Precision mean: 0.865), whereas
failure cases exhibited lower concordance (Index Precision mean: 0.460). The
key takeaway is that chirp-based outlier detection, combined with weighted
spatial metrics, provides a complementary method for SOZ localization,
particularly in patients with successful surgical outcomes.

Abstract: Designing de-novo molecules with desired property profiles requires efficient
exploration of the vast chemical space ranging from $10^{23}$ to $10^{60}$
possible synthesizable candidates. While various deep generative models have
been developed to design small molecules using diverse input representations,
Molecular Large Language Models (Mol-LLMs) based on string representations have
emerged as a scalable approach capable of exploring billions of molecules.
However, there remains limited understanding regarding how standard language
modeling practices such as textual representations, tokenization strategies,
model size, and dataset scale impact molecular generation performance. In this
work, we systematically investigate these critical aspects by introducing
NovoMolGen, a family of transformer-based foundation models pretrained on 1.5
billion molecules for de-novo molecule generation. Through extensive empirical
analyses, we identify a weak correlation between performance metrics measured
during pretraining and actual downstream performance, revealing important
distinctions between molecular and general NLP training dynamics. NovoMolGen
establishes new state-of-the-art results, substantially outperforming prior
Mol-LLMs and specialized generative models in both unconstrained and
goal-directed molecular generation tasks, thus providing a robust foundation
for advancing efficient and effective molecular modeling strategies.

Motivation: 传统上下文耻杆机假设数据要么完全集中要么完全隔离，在网络环境中部分信息共享的情况下研究不充分。需要开发能够在网络中自适应性共享信息的算法。

Conclusion: 该研究为网络环境下的上下文耻杆机问题提供了有效的解决方案，通过动态信息共享机制在降低通信成本的同时提高学习效果，两种算法各有优势适用于不同的应用场景。

Abstract: We consider contextual linear bandits over networks, a class of sequential
decision-making problems where learning occurs simultaneously across multiple
locations and the reward distributions share structural similarities while also
exhibiting local differences. While classical contextual bandits assume either
fully centralized data or entirely isolated learners, much remains unexplored
in networked environments when information is partially shared. In this paper,
we address this gap by developing two network-aware Upper Confidence Bound
(UCB) algorithms, NetLinUCB and Net-SGD-UCB, which enable adaptive information
sharing guided by dynamically updated network weights. Our approach decompose
learning into global and local components and as a result allow agents to
benefit from shared structure without full synchronization. Both algorithms
incur lighter communication costs compared to a fully centralized setting as
agents only share computed summaries regarding the homogeneous features. We
establish regret bounds showing that our methods reduce the learning complexity
associated with the shared structure from $O(N)$ to sublinear $O(\sqrt{N})$,
where $N$ is the size of the network. The two algorithms reveal complementary
strengths: NetLinUCB excels in low-noise regimes with fine-grained
heterogeneity, while Net-SGD-UCB is robust to high-dimensional, high-variance
contexts. We further demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods across
simulated pricing environments compared to standard benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法需要为每个目标或偏好配置微调模型，计算成本高且不灵活，需要一种动态控制LLM行为的方法

Method: 训练一组小型价值模型对应不同目标，推理时根据用户指定权重组合这些模型产生倾斜函数来调整基础模型的输出分布

Result: MAVIS优于为每个目标微调模型并事后组合的基线方法，甚至接近为用户的精确偏好微调模型的理想性能

Conclusion: MAVIS提供了一种计算高效且灵活的多目标对齐方法，能够在推理时动态调整模型行为

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed across diverse
applications that demand balancing multiple, often conflicting, objectives --
such as helpfulness, harmlessness, or humor. Aligning outputs to user-specific
preferences in such multi-objective settings typically requires fine-tuning
models for each objective or preference configuration, which is computationally
expensive and inflexible. We introduce MAVIS -- Multi-Objective Alignment via
Value-Guided Inference-Time Search -- a lightweight inference-time alignment
framework that enables dynamic control over LLM behavior without modifying the
base model's weights. MAVIS trains a set of small value models, each
corresponding to a distinct objective. At inference time, these value models
are combined using user-specified weights to produce a tilting function that
adjusts the base model's output distribution toward desired trade-offs. The
value models are trained using a simple iterative algorithm that ensures
monotonic improvement of the KL-regularized policy. We show empirically that
MAVIS outperforms baselines that fine-tune per-objective models and combine
them post hoc, and even approaches the performance of the idealized setting
where models are fine-tuned for a user's exact preferences.

Motivation: 传统时间序列预测方法主要依赖单一模态数据，无法有效利用文本事件信息来改善非平稳动态预测。现有方法面临时序-文本细粒度同步困难、文本语义引入的时间不确定性以及多分辨率时序模式与文本嵌入不对齐三大挑战。

Method: 提出EventTSF自回归生成框架：1）使用自回归扩散和流匹配捕捉时序-事件交互；2）根据事件语义信号自适应控制流匹配时间步长；3）采用多模态U形扩散transformer在不同分辨率下高效融合时序和文本模态。

Result: 在8个合成和真实数据集上的实验表明，EventTSF相比12个基线方法在预测准确率上提升10.7%，训练效率提高1.13倍，在各种事件感知的非平稳时间序列预测场景中均表现优异。

Conclusion: EventTSF成功解决了多模态时间序列预测中的关键挑战，通过创新的扩散transformer架构实现了时序和文本事件的有效融合，为非平稳时间序列预测提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Time series forecasting plays a vital role in critical domains like energy
and transportation, where non-stationary dynamics are deeply intertwined with
events in other modalities such as texts. However, incorporating natural
language-based external events to improve non-stationary forecasting remains
largely unexplored, as most approaches still rely on a single modality,
resulting in limited contextual knowledge and model underperformance. Enabling
fine-grained multimodal interactions between temporal and textual data is
challenged by three fundamental issues: (1) the difficulty of fine-grained
synchronization between time-varying discrete textual events and continuous
time series; (2) the inherent temporal uncertainty introduced by textual
semantics; and (3) the misalignment between textual event embeddings and
multi-resolution temporal patterns. In this work, we address these challenges
by introducing event-aware non-stationary time series forecasting (EventTSF),
an autoregressive generation framework that integrates historical time series
with textual events to make subsequent forecasts. Specifically, EventTSF uses
autoregressive diffusion with flow matching at each step to capture nuanced
temporal-event interactions. To handle event-induced uncertainty, flow matching
timesteps are adaptively controlled according to event semantic signals. The
underlying denoiser employs a multimodal U-shaped diffusion transformer that
efficiently fuses temporal and textual modalities across different resolutions.
Extensive experiments on 8 synthetic and real-world datasets show that EventTSF
outperforms 12 baselines across diverse event-aware non-stationary time series
forecasting scenarios, achieving substantial improvements of 10.7% higher
forecasting accuracy and $1.13\times$ faster training efficiency.

*Jiayu Fang,Zhiqi Shao,S T Boris Choy,Junbin Gao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SVDformer是一个结合SVD和Transformer的新框架，用于有向图的表示学习，通过多头自注意力优化奇异值嵌入，在节点分类任务上优于现有方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有有向图神经网络难以同时捕捉方向语义和全局结构模式，因为各向同性聚合机制和局部滤波机制的局限性

Method: 使用SVD分解，通过Transformer多头自注意力优化奇异值嵌入，将奇异向量作为方向投影基，奇异值作为缩放因子，建模入边/出边模式的多尺度交互

Result: 在六个有向图基准测试中，SVDformer在节点分类任务上始终优于最先进的GNN和方向感知基线方法

Conclusion: SVDformer为有向图表示学习建立了新范式，能够显式保持边方向性并有效建模多尺度方向交互

Abstract: Directed graphs are widely used to model asymmetric relationships in
real-world systems. However, existing directed graph neural networks often
struggle to jointly capture directional semantics and global structural
patterns due to their isotropic aggregation mechanisms and localized filtering
mechanisms. To address this limitation, this paper proposes SVDformer, a novel
framework that synergizes SVD and Transformer architecture for direction-aware
graph representation learning. SVDformer first refines singular value
embeddings through multi-head self-attention, adaptively enhancing critical
spectral components while suppressing high-frequency noise. This enables
learnable low-pass/high-pass graph filtering without requiring spectral
kernels. Furthermore, by treating singular vectors as directional projection
bases and singular values as scaling factors, SVDformer uses the Transformer to
model multi-scale interactions between incoming/outgoing edge patterns through
attention weights, thereby explicitly preserving edge directionality during
feature propagation. Extensive experiments on six directed graph benchmarks
demonstrate that SVDformer consistently outperforms state-of-the-art GNNs and
direction-aware baselines on node classification tasks, establishing a new
paradigm for learning representations on directed graphs.

Method: 使用历史元知识选择有前景的搜索空间区域，动态设计搜索空间来加速优化过程。

Result: 方法能够在Random Search中减少89%运行时间，大幅缩减搜索空间（预处理器从13个减到1.8个，分类器从16个减到4.3个），同时保持竞争性能。

Conclusion: 该元学习方法有效解决了AutoML的计算成本和过拟合问题，在Auto-Sklearn中也显示了良好的适配性能，为AutoML系统的效率提升提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Automated machine learning (AutoML) has democratized the design of machine
learning based systems, by automating model selection, hyperparameter tuning
and feature engineering. However, the high computational cost associated with
traditional search and optimization strategies, such as Random Search, Particle
Swarm Optimization and Bayesian Optimization, remains a significant challenge.
Moreover, AutoML systems typically explore a large search space, which can lead
to overfitting. This paper introduces a metalearning method for dynamically
designing search spaces for AutoML system. The proposed method uses historical
metaknowledge to select promising regions of the search space, accelerating the
optimization process. According to experiments conducted for this study, the
proposed method can reduce runtime by 89\% in Random Search and search space by
(1.8/13 preprocessor and 4.3/16 classifier), without compromising significant
predictive performance. Moreover, the proposed method showed competitive
performance when adapted to Auto-Sklearn, reducing its search space.
Furthermore, this study encompasses insights into meta-feature selection,
meta-model explainability, and the trade-offs inherent in search space
reduction strategies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实应用中机器学习模型面临在线标签偏移问题，标签分布随时间变化。有效的适应需要仔细选择学习率：过低会减慢适应速度，过高会导致不稳定。

Method: 提出ASAP方法，动态调整学习率，通过计算当前和先前未标记输出的余弦距离，并将其映射到有界范围内。该方法无需标签、模型集成或过去输入，仅使用先前的softmax输出。

Result: 在多个数据集和偏移场景的实验表明，ASAP持续提高准确性和效率。

Conclusion: ASAP使得无监督模型适应变得实用，提供了一种快速轻量级的适应解决方案。

Abstract: In real-world applications, machine learning models face online label shift,
where label distributions change over time. Effective adaptation requires
careful learning rate selection: too low slows adaptation and too high causes
instability. We propose ASAP (Adaptive Shift Aware Post-training), which
dynamically adjusts the learning rate by computing the cosine distance between
current and previous unlabeled outputs and mapping it within a bounded range.
ASAP requires no labels, model ensembles, or past inputs, using only the
previous softmax output for fast, lightweight adaptation. Experiments across
multiple datasets and shift scenarios show ASAP consistently improves accuracy
and efficiency, making it practical for unsupervised model adaptation.

Motivation: 层次多标签分类(HMC)面临结构一致性维持和多任务学习中损失权重平衡的挑战，传统MTL方法存在"一强多弱"的优化偏差

Method: 提出HCAL分类器，结合原型对比学习和适应性任务权重机制，通过显式建模标签原型和子类向父类的特征聚合保证语义一致性，并使用原型扰动机制扩展决策边界

Result: 在三个数据集上的实验表明，该方法在分类准确率和层次违规率(HVR)方面都显著超过基线模型

Conclusion: HCAL通过语义一致性和动态优化资源分配，有效解决了HMC中的结构一致性和MTL优化偏差问题，提高了分类性能和层次一致性

Abstract: Hierarchical Multi-Label Classification (HMC) faces critical challenges in
maintaining structural consistency and balancing loss weighting in Multi-Task
Learning (MTL). In order to address these issues, we propose a classifier
called HCAL based on MTL integrated with prototype contrastive learning and
adaptive task-weighting mechanisms. The most significant advantage of our
classifier is semantic consistency including both prototype with explicitly
modeling label and feature aggregation from child classes to parent classes.
The other important advantage is an adaptive loss-weighting mechanism that
dynamically allocates optimization resources by monitoring task-specific
convergence rates. It effectively resolves the "one-strong-many-weak"
optimization bias inherent in traditional MTL approaches. To further enhance
robustness, a prototype perturbation mechanism is formulated by injecting
controlled noise into prototype to expand decision boundaries. Additionally, we
formalize a quantitative metric called Hierarchical Violation Rate (HVR) as to
evaluate hierarchical consistency and generalization. Extensive experiments
across three datasets demonstrate both the higher classification accuracy and
reduced hierarchical violation rate of the proposed classifier over baseline
models.

Abstract: This study presents a pipeline leveraging t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor
Embedding (t-SNE) for interpretable visualizations of chirp features across
diverse outcome scenarios. The dataset, comprising chirp-based temporal,
spectral, and frequency metrics. Using t-SNE, local neighborhood relationships
were preserved while addressing the crowding problem through Student
t-distribution-based similarity optimization. Three classification tasks were
formulated on the 2D t-SNE embeddings: (1) distinguishing clinical success from
failure/no-resection, (2) separating high-difficulty from low-difficulty cases,
and (3) identifying optimal cases, defined as successful outcomes with minimal
clinical difficulty. Four classifiers, namely, Random Forests, Support Vector
Machines, Logistic Regression, and k-Nearest Neighbors, were trained and
evaluated using stratified 5-fold cross-validation. Across tasks, the Random
Forest and k-NN classifiers demonstrated superior performance, achieving up to
88.8% accuracy in optimal case detection (successful outcomes with minimal
clinical difficulty). Additionally, feature influence sensitivity maps were
generated using SHAP explanations applied to model predicting t-SNE
coordinates, revealing spatially localized feature importance within the
embedding space. These maps highlighted how specific chirp attributes drive
regional clustering and class separation, offering insights into the latent
structure of the data. The integrated framework showcases the potential of
interpretable embeddings and local feature attribution for clinical
stratification and decision support.

Conclusion: DyMixOp框架成功地将无限维非线性PDE动力学转换为有限维潜在空间，通过创新的LGM变换有效缓解了频谱偏差问题，为PDE的神经算子方法提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: A primary challenge in using neural networks to approximate nonlinear
dynamical systems governed by partial differential equations (PDEs) is
transforming these systems into a suitable format, especially when dealing with
non-linearizable dynamics or the need for infinite-dimensional spaces for
linearization. This paper introduces DyMixOp, a novel neural operator framework
for PDEs that integrates insights from complex dynamical systems to address
this challenge. Grounded in inertial manifold theory, DyMixOp transforms
infinite-dimensional nonlinear PDE dynamics into a finite-dimensional latent
space, establishing a structured foundation that maintains essential nonlinear
interactions and enhances physical interpretability. A key innovation is the
Local-Global-Mixing (LGM) transformation, inspired by convection dynamics in
turbulence. This transformation effectively captures both fine-scale details
and nonlinear interactions, while mitigating spectral bias commonly found in
existing neural operators. The framework is further strengthened by a
dynamics-informed architecture that connects multiple LGM layers to approximate
linear and nonlinear dynamics, reflecting the temporal evolution of dynamical
systems. Experimental results across diverse PDE benchmarks demonstrate that
DyMixOp achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly reducing
prediction errors, particularly in convection-dominated scenarios reaching up
to 86.7\%, while maintaining computational efficiency and scalability.

Abstract: Predicting particle trajectories with neural networks (NNs) has substantially
enhanced many scientific and engineering domains. However, effectively
quantifying and visualizing the inherent uncertainty in predictions remains
challenging. Without an understanding of the uncertainty, the reliability of NN
models in applications where trustworthiness is paramount is significantly
compromised. This paper introduces the uncertainty tube, a novel,
computationally efficient visualization method designed to represent this
uncertainty in NN-derived particle paths. Our key innovation is the design and
implementation of a superelliptical tube that accurately captures and
intuitively conveys nonsymmetric uncertainty. By integrating well-established
uncertainty quantification techniques, such as Deep Ensembles, Monte Carlo
Dropout (MC Dropout), and Stochastic Weight Averaging-Gaussian (SWAG), we
demonstrate the practical utility of the uncertainty tube, showcasing its
application on both synthetic and simulation datasets.

Conclusion: 算法不透明性是一个多层面的问题，需要区分不同类型并采取针对性解决方案，当前解释性AI技术仍需进一步发展才能有效应对技术复杂性带来的不透明挑战

Abstract: The opaqueness of many complex machine learning algorithms is often mentioned
as one of the main obstacles to the ethical development of artificial
intelligence (AI). But what does it mean for an algorithm to be opaque? Highly
complex algorithms such as artificial neural networks process enormous volumes
of data in parallel along multiple hidden layers of interconnected nodes,
rendering their inner workings epistemically inaccessible to any human being,
including their designers and developers; they are "black boxes" for all their
stakeholders. But opaqueness is not always the inevitable result of technical
complexity. Sometimes, the way an algorithm works is intentionally hidden from
view for proprietary reasons, especially in commercial automated decision
systems, creating an entirely different type of opaqueness. In the first part
of the chapter, we will examine these two ways of understanding opacity and the
ethical implications that stem from each of them. In the second part, we
explore the different explanatory methods that have been developed in computer
science to overcome an AI system's technical opaqueness. As the analysis shows,
explainable AI (XAI) still faces numerous challenges.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着可再生能源在电网中渗透率增加，需要建筑群提供协调的需求灵活性。现有测试平台大多针对单栋建筑，多建筑平台有限且通常依赖简化模型，无法充分捕捉物理细节和中间变量，限制了控制策略的公平基准测试。

Method: 开发MuFlex平台，支持EnergyPlus建筑模型的同步信息交换，遵循最新OpenAI Gym接口，提供模块化、标准化的强化学习实现。使用Soft Actor-Critic算法对四栋办公楼进行案例研究。

Result: 聚合四栋建筑的灵活性成功将总峰值需求降至指定阈值以下，同时保持了室内环境质量。

Conclusion: MuFlex平台为多建筑灵活性协调控制提供了有效的基准测试工具，证明了建筑群聚合在需求响应中的可行性。

Abstract: With the increasing penetration of renewable generation on the power grid,
maintaining system balance requires coordinated demand flexibility from
aggregations of buildings. Reinforcement learning (RL) has been widely explored
for building controls because of its model-free nature. Open-source simulation
testbeds are essential not only for training RL agents but also for fairly
benchmarking control strategies. However, most building-sector testbeds target
single buildings; multi-building platforms are relatively limited and typically
rely on simplified models (e.g., Resistance-Capacitance) or data-driven
approaches, which lack the ability to fully capture the physical intricacies
and intermediate variables necessary for interpreting control performance.
Moreover, these platforms often impose fixed inputs, outputs, and model
formats, restricting their applicability as benchmarking tools across diverse
control scenarios. To address these gaps, MuFlex, a scalable, open-source
platform for benchmarking and testing control strategies for multi-building
flexibility coordination, was developed in this study. MuFlex enables
synchronous information exchange across EnergyPlus building models and adheres
to the latest OpenAI Gym interface, providing a modular, standardized RL
implementation. The platform capabilities were demonstrated in a case study
coordinating demand flexibility across four office buildings using the Soft
Actor-Critic algorithm with carefully fine-tuned hyperparameters. The results
show that aggregating the four buildings flexibility reduced total peak demand
below a specified threshold while maintaining indoor environmental quality.

Conclusion: 该混合框架提供了准确、可解释的多空间分辨率预测，支持感染控制政策和爆发风险的反事实分析，为公共卫生决策提供了有力工具。

Abstract: Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is a critical public
health threat within hospitals as well as long-term care facilities. Better
understanding of MRSA risks, evaluation of interventions and forecasting MRSA
rates are important public health problems. Existing forecasting models rely on
statistical or neural network approaches, which lack epidemiological
interpretability, and have limited performance. Mechanistic epidemic models are
difficult to calibrate and limited in incorporating diverse datasets. We
present CALYPSO, a hybrid framework that integrates neural networks with
mechanistic metapopulation models to capture the spread dynamics of infectious
diseases (i.e., MRSA) across healthcare and community settings. Our model
leverages patient-level insurance claims, commuting data, and healthcare
transfer patterns to learn region- and time-specific parameters governing MRSA
spread. This enables accurate, interpretable forecasts at multiple spatial
resolutions (county, healthcare facility, region, state) and supports
counterfactual analyses of infection control policies and outbreak risks. We
also show that CALYPSO improves statewide forecasting performance by over 4.5%
compared to machine learning baselines, while also identifying high-risk
regions and cost-effective strategies for allocating infection prevention
resources.

Motivation: 现有的基因风险预测模型主要基于常见变异，预测准确性不足以满足临床需求，需要统合考虑稀有变异来提升预测性能

Method: 提出了摘取接收者操作特征的CROC方法，是原有FROC方法的扩展，特别加入了处理稀有变异的算法，使用了GAW17数据集中37个候选基因的533个SNP进行验证

Result: 统合所有SNP的预测模型(AUC=0.605)比仅使用常见变异的模型(AUC=0.585)更准确；当常见变异数量减少时，CROC方法显著超过FROC方法；在仅有稀有变异的极端情况下，CROC达到AUC=0.603，而FROC仅有AUC=0.524

Conclusion: CROC方法能够有效统合常见和稀有变异进行风险预测，特别是在稀有变异主导的情况下显著提升了预测性能，为更全面的疾病风险预测提供了新的分析方法

Abstract: Risk prediction that capitalizes on emerging genetic findings holds great
promise for improving public health and clinical care. However, recent risk
prediction research has shown that predictive tests formed on existing common
genetic loci, including those from genome-wide association studies, have lacked
sufficient accuracy for clinical use. Because most rare variants on the genome
have not yet been studied for their role in risk prediction, future disease
prediction discoveries should shift toward a more comprehensive risk prediction
strategy that takes into account both common and rare variants. We are
proposing a collapsing receiver operating characteristic CROC approach for risk
prediction research on both common and rare variants. The new approach is an
extension of a previously developed forward ROC FROC approach, with additional
procedures for handling rare variants. The approach was evaluated through the
use of 533 single-nucleotide polymorphisms SNPs in 37 candidate genes from the
Genetic Analysis Workshop 17 mini-exome data set. We found that a prediction
model built on all SNPs gained more accuracy AUC = 0.605 than one built on
common variants alone AUC = 0.585. We further evaluated the performance of two
approaches by gradually reducing the number of common variants in the analysis.
We found that the CROC method attained more accuracy than the FROC method when
the number of common variants in the data decreased. In an extreme scenario,
when there are only rare variants in the data, the CROC reached an AUC value of
0.603, whereas the FROC had an AUC value of 0.524.

Abstract: The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), in 2019, designated
Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) as a serious antimicrobial
resistance threat. The risk of acquiring MRSA and suffering life-threatening
consequences due to it remains especially high for hospitalized patients due to
a unique combination of factors, including: co-morbid conditions, immuno
suppression, antibiotic use, and risk of contact with contaminated hospital
workers and equipment. In this paper, we present a novel generative
probabilistic model, GenHAI, for modeling sequences of MRSA test results
outcomes for patients during a single hospitalization. This model can be used
to answer many important questions from the perspectives of hospital
administrators for mitigating the risk of MRSA infections. Our model is based
on the probabilistic programming paradigm, and can be used to approximately
answer a variety of predictive, causal, and counterfactual questions. We
demonstrate the efficacy of our model by comparing it against discriminative
and generative machine learning models using two real-world datasets.

Conclusion: GLF框架为自监督对比学习提供了统一的理论基础，ADC方法作为即插即用组件能够显著提升现有方法的性能。

Abstract: Self-supervised contrastive learning (SSCL) has recently demonstrated
superiority in multiple downstream tasks. In this paper, we generalize the
standard SSCL methods to a Generalized Learning Framework (GLF) consisting of
two parts: the aligning part and the constraining part. We analyze three
existing SSCL methods: BYOL, Barlow Twins, and SwAV, and show that they can be
unified under GLF with different choices of the constraining part. We further
propose empirical and theoretical analyses providing two insights into
designing the constraining part of GLF: intra-class compactness and inter-class
separability, which measure how well the feature space preserves the class
information of the inputs. However, since SSCL can not use labels, it is
challenging to design a constraining part that satisfies these properties. To
address this issue, we consider inducing intra-class compactness and
inter-class separability by iteratively capturing the dynamic relationship
between anchor and other samples and propose a plug-and-play method called
Adaptive Distribution Calibration (ADC) to ensure that samples that are near or
far from the anchor point in the original input space are closer or further
away from the anchor point in the feature space. Both the theoretical analysis
and the empirical evaluation demonstrate the superiority of ADC.

Abstract: The machine learning community has recently put effort into quantized or
low-precision arithmetics to scale large models. This paper proposes performing
probabilistic inference in the quantized, discrete parameter space created by
these representations, effectively enabling us to learn a continuous
distribution using discrete parameters. We consider both 2D densities and
quantized neural networks, where we introduce a tractable learning approach
using probabilistic circuits. This method offers a scalable solution to manage
complex distributions and provides clear insights into model behavior. We
validate our approach with various models, demonstrating inference efficiency
without sacrificing accuracy. This work advances scalable, interpretable
machine learning by utilizing discrete approximations for probabilistic
computations.

Conclusion: 该研究为应用部分识别方法提供了系统化的比较分析和实用工具，通过CausalBoundingEngine开源包促进这些方法在实际问题中的应用。

Abstract: Causal inference often hinges on strong assumptions - such as no unmeasured
confounding or perfect compliance - that are rarely satisfied in practice.
Partial identification offers a principled alternative: instead of relying on
unverifiable assumptions to estimate causal effects precisely, it derives
bounds that reflect the uncertainty inherent in the data. Despite its
theoretical appeal, partial identification remains underutilized in applied
work, in part due to the fragmented nature of existing methods and the lack of
practical guidance. This thesis addresses these challenges by systematically
comparing a diverse set of bounding algorithms across multiple causal
scenarios. We implement, extend, and unify state-of-the-art methods - including
symbolic, optimization-based, and information-theoretic approaches - within a
common evaluation framework. In particular, we propose an extension of a
recently introduced entropy-bounded method, making it applicable to
counterfactual queries such as the Probability of Necessity and Sufficiency
(PNS). Our empirical study spans thousands of randomized simulations involving
both discrete and continuous data-generating processes. We assess each method
in terms of bound tightness, computational efficiency, and robustness to
assumption violations. To support practitioners, we distill our findings into a
practical decision tree for algorithm selection and train a machine learning
model to predict the best-performing method based on observable data
characteristics.
  All implementations are released as part of an open-source Python package,
CausalBoundingEngine, which enables users to apply and compare bounding methods
through a unified interface.

TL;DR: FedOL是一个联邦学习框架，通过知识蒸馏在单轮通信中构建更大的服务器模型，使用未标记公共数据集交换预测输出而非模型参数，解决了异构模型架构和通信开销问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统联邦学习需要统一模型架构和多轮通信，忽略了资源异构性，给客户端带来沉重计算负担并增加通信开销。移动网络中客户端拥有宝贵私有数据但计算资源有限，需要更高效的解决方案。

Method: 采用知识蒸馏方法，客户端在未标记公共数据集上交换预测输出而非模型参数；引入专门的目标函数迭代优化伪标签和服务器模型；设计定制化的伪标签生成和知识蒸馏策略整合多样化知识。

Result: 仿真结果显示FedOL显著优于现有基线方法，为移动网络提供了成本效益高的解决方案。

Conclusion: FedOL通过单轮通信的知识蒸馏方法有效解决了联邦学习中的模型异构性和通信效率问题，特别适合计算资源有限的移动客户端场景。

Abstract: Large models, renowned for superior performance, outperform smaller ones even
without billion-parameter scales. While mobile network servers have ample
computational resources to support larger models than client devices, privacy
constraints prevent clients from directly sharing their raw data. Federated
Learning (FL) enables decentralized clients to collaboratively train a shared
model by exchanging model parameters instead of transmitting raw data. Yet, it
requires a uniform model architecture and multiple communication rounds, which
neglect resource heterogeneity, impose heavy computational demands on clients,
and increase communication overhead. To address these challenges, we propose
FedOL, to construct a larger and more comprehensive server model in one-shot
settings (i.e., in a single communication round). Instead of model parameter
sharing, FedOL employs knowledge distillation, where clients only exchange
model prediction outputs on an unlabeled public dataset. This reduces
communication overhead by transmitting compact predictions instead of full
model weights and enables model customization by allowing heterogeneous model
architectures. A key challenge in this setting is that client predictions may
be biased due to skewed local data distributions, and the lack of ground-truth
labels in the public dataset further complicates reliable learning. To mitigate
these issues, FedOL introduces a specialized objective function that
iteratively refines pseudo-labels and the server model, improving learning
reliability. To complement this, FedOL incorporates a tailored pseudo-label
generation and knowledge distillation strategy that effectively integrates
diverse knowledge. Simulation results show that FedOL significantly outperforms
existing baselines, offering a cost-effective solution for mobile networks
where clients possess valuable private data but limited computational
resources.

Abstract: How far are we really from automatically generating neural networks? While
neural network weight generation shows promise, current approaches struggle
with generalization to unseen tasks and practical application exploration. To
address this, we propose T2W, a diffusion transformer framework that generates
task-specific weights conditioned on natural language descriptions. T2W
hierarchically processes network parameters into uniform blocks, integrates
text embeddings from CLIP via a prior attention mechanism, and employs
adversarial training with weight-space augmentation to enhance generalization.
Experiments on Cifar100, Caltech256, and TinyImageNet demonstrate T2W's ability
to produce high-quality weights for unseen tasks, outperforming
optimization-based initialization and enabling novel applications such as
weight enhancement and text-guided model fusion. Our work bridges textual
semantics with weight-space dynamics, supported by an open-source dataset of
text-weight pairs, advancing the practicality of generative models in neural
network parameter synthesis. Our code is available on Github.

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种自然直接的学习率自动调整方案，避免了调参的复杂性，具有实际应用价值

Abstract: Modern machine learning is trained by stochastic gradient descent (SGD),
whose performance critically depends on how the learning rate (LR) is adjusted
and decreased over time. Yet existing LR regimes may be intricate, or need to
tune one or more additional hyper-parameters manually whose bottlenecks include
huge computational expenditure, time and power in practice. This work, in a
natural and direct manner, clarifies how LR should be updated automatically
only according to the intrinsic variation of stochastic gradients. An
explainable LR regime by leveraging stochastic second-order algorithms is
developed, behaving a similar pattern to heuristic algorithms but implemented
simply without any parameter tuning requirement, where it is of an automatic
procedure that LR should increase (decrease) as the norm of stochastic
gradients decreases (increases). The resulting LR regime shows its efficiency,
robustness, and scalability in different classical stochastic algorithms,
containing SGD, SGDM, and SIGNSGD, on machine learning tasks.

Conclusion: FedSheafHN框架通过套庄协作机制有效解决了子图联邦学习中的异质性问题，为个性化模型生成提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Graph-structured data is prevalent in many applications. In subgraph
federated learning (FL), this data is distributed across clients, each with a
local subgraph. Personalized subgraph FL aims to develop a customized model for
each client to handle diverse data distributions. However, performance
variation across clients remains a key issue due to the heterogeneity of local
subgraphs. To overcome the challenge, we propose FedSheafHN, a novel framework
built on a sheaf collaboration mechanism to unify enhanced client descriptors
with efficient personalized model generation. Specifically, FedSheafHN embeds
each client's local subgraph into a server-constructed collaboration graph by
leveraging graph-level embeddings and employing sheaf diffusion within the
collaboration graph to enrich client representations. Subsequently, FedSheafHN
generates customized client models via a server-optimized hypernetwork.
Empirical evaluations demonstrate that FedSheafHN outperforms existing
personalized subgraph FL methods on various graph datasets. Additionally, it
exhibits fast model convergence and effectively generalizes to new clients.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM依靠数据训练缩放和推理时缩放，本文提出输入时间缩放作为补充，通过精炼查询来提升模型性能

Method: 在训练和测试阶段都采用元知识精炼输入的策略，发现训练测试协同设计的重要性，使用表面低质量数据甚至混入无关信息

Result: 在Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct上达到AIME24(76.7%)和AIME25(76.7%)的SOTA性能，多模型投票后可达AIME24(76.7%)和AIME25(80%)，DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B最高能达86.7%和76.7%

Conclusion: 输入精炼是有效的缩放方式，质量过高的数据可能限制性能上限，少量数据即可激活高级推理能力，符合"Less is More"现象

Abstract: Current Large Language Models (LLMs) are usually post-trained on large-scale
carefully curated datasets (data & training scaling) and doing reasoning in
test time (inference time scaling). In this work, we present a new scaling
paradigm, Input Time Scaling, to complement previous scaling methods by putting
resources on queries (input time). During training and testing, we combine
meta-knowledge from LLMs to refine inputs with different strategies. We also
find a new phenomenon, training-testing co-design there. We need to apply query
strategies during both training and testing. Only applying strategies on
training or testing would seriously degrade the performance. We are also
surprised to find that seemingly low data quality datasets can gain high
performance. Adding irrelevant information to the queries, randomly selecting
examples from a minimally filtered dataset, can even perform the best. These
findings contradict the widely held inductive bias, "garbage in, garbage out".
Curating datasets with seemingly high-quality data can even potentially limit
the performance ceiling. In addition, models trained on more data with similar
quality (15k VS 1k) perform worse, simple dataset size scaling should also be
carefully inspected. The good news is that our findings are compatible with the
Less is More phenomenon. A small set of examples is enough to evoke high-level
reasoning ability. With experiments on models trained on Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct,
we are able to reach SOTA performance among 32B models on AIME24(76.7%) and
AIME25(76.7%) pass@1. We can further achieve AIME24(76.7%) and AIME25(80%) with
a majority vote of three models. Starting from DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B,
the best result would be 86.7% on AIME24 and 76.7% on AIME25. To facilitate
reproducibility and further research, we are working on open-source our
datasets, data pipelines, evaluation results, and checkpoints.

Result: 在一个新基准和两个现有标准基准任务上的实验结果表明，PS-PFN相比其他老虎机和AutoML策略具有优越性能。

Conclusion: 该工作成功扩展了CASH框架以适应现代ML流水线，PS-PFN方法为异构ML流水线的自动选择和适配提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Combined Algorithm Selection and Hyperparameter Optimization (CASH) has been
fundamental to traditional AutoML systems. However, with the advancements of
pre-trained models, modern ML workflows go beyond hyperparameter optimization
and often require fine-tuning, ensembling, and other adaptation techniques.
While the core challenge of identifying the best-performing model for a
downstream task remains, the increasing heterogeneity of ML pipelines demands
novel AutoML approaches. This work extends the CASH framework to select and
adapt modern ML pipelines. We propose PS-PFN to efficiently explore and exploit
adapting ML pipelines by extending Posterior Sampling (PS) to the max k-armed
bandit problem setup. PS-PFN leverages prior-data fitted networks (PFNs) to
efficiently estimate the posterior distribution of the maximal value via
in-context learning. We show how to extend this method to consider varying
costs of pulling arms and to use different PFNs to model reward distributions
individually per arm. Experimental results on one novel and two existing
standard benchmark tasks demonstrate the superior performance of PS-PFN
compared to other bandit and AutoML strategies. We make our code and data
available at https://github.com/amirbalef/CASHPlus.

Conclusion: 该方法为MARL通信提供了一种简洁、可微分且效果显著的解决方案

Abstract: Communication is essential for the collective execution of complex tasks by
human agents, motivating interest in communication mechanisms for multi-agent
reinforcement learning (MARL). However, existing communication protocols in
MARL are often complex and non-differentiable. In this work, we introduce a
self-attention-based communication module that exchanges information between
the agents in MARL. Our proposed approach is fully differentiable, allowing
agents to learn to generate messages in a reward-driven manner. The module can
be seamlessly integrated with any action-value function decomposition method
and can be viewed as an extension of such decompositions. Notably, it includes
a fixed number of trainable parameters, independent of the number of agents.
Experimental results on the SMAC benchmark demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach, which achieves state-of-the-art performance on several maps.

Motivation: 现有重尾bandit研究主要集中在随机环境，对抗性环境的研究很少且仅限于MAB特例，需要开发适用于对抗性重尾bandit的通用算法框架。

Method: 使用FTRL算法，在损失估计上添加精心设计的奖励函数，提出HT-SPM数据依赖学习率，并结合方差缩减线性损失估计器。

Result: 在重尾MAB中实现了Õ(T^(1/ε))对抗性遗憾和Õ(log T)随机性遗憾；在线性bandit中获得了Õ(d^(1/2)T^(1/ε))遗憾界，与随机环境最佳结果匹配。

Conclusion: 提出了首个对抗性重尾bandit通用框架，在MAB和线性bandit中均实现了BOBW性能，为重尾噪声下的对抗性学习提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Heavy-tailed bandits have been extensively studied since the seminal work of
\citet{Bubeck2012BanditsWH}. In particular, heavy-tailed linear bandits,
enabling efficient learning with both a large number of arms and heavy-tailed
noises, have recently attracted significant attention
\citep{ShaoYKL18,XueWWZ20,ZhongHYW21,Wang2025heavy,tajdini2025improved}.
However, prior studies focus almost exclusively on stochastic regimes, with few
exceptions limited to the special case of heavy-tailed multi-armed bandits
(MABs) \citep{Huang0H22,ChengZ024,Chen2024uniINF}.
  In this work, we propose a general framework for adversarial heavy-tailed
bandit problems, which performs follow-the-regularized-leader (FTRL) over the
loss estimates shifted by a bonus function. Via a delicate setup of the bonus
function, we devise the first FTRL-type best-of-both-worlds (BOBW) algorithm
for heavy-tailed MABs, which does not require the truncated non-negativity
assumption and achieves an $\widetilde{O}(T^{\frac{1}{\varepsilon}})$
worst-case regret in the adversarial regime as well as an $\widetilde{O}(\log
T)$ gap-dependent regret in the stochastic regime. We then extend our framework
to the linear case, proposing the first algorithm for adversarial heavy-tailed
linear bandits with finite arm sets. This algorithm achieves an
$\widetilde{O}(d^{\frac{1}{2}}T^{\frac{1}{\varepsilon}})$ regret, matching the
best-known worst-case regret bound in stochastic regimes. Moreover, we propose
a general data-dependent learning rate, termed \textit{heavy-tailed noise aware
stability-penalty matching} (HT-SPM). We prove that HT-SPM guarantees BOBW
regret bounds for general heavy-tailed bandit problems once certain conditions
are satisfied. By using HT-SPM and, in particular, a variance-reduced linear
loss estimator, we obtain the first BOBW result for heavy-tailed linear
bandits.

Abstract: Existing research on single-machine scheduling is largely focused on exact
algorithms, which perform well on typical instances but can significantly
deteriorate on certain regions of the problem space. In contrast, data-driven
approaches provide strong and scalable performance when tailored to the
structure of specific datasets. Leveraging this idea, we focus on a
single-machine scheduling problem where each job is defined by its weight,
duration, due date, and deadline, aiming to minimize the total weight of tardy
jobs. We introduce a novel data-driven scheduling heuristic that combines
machine learning with problem-specific characteristics, ensuring feasible
solutions, which is a common challenge for ML-based algorithms. Experimental
results demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms the
state-of-the-art in terms of optimality gap, number of optimal solutions, and
adaptability across varied data scenarios, highlighting its flexibility for
practical applications. In addition, we conduct a systematic exploration of ML
models, addressing a common gap in similar studies by offering a detailed model
selection process and providing insights into why the chosen model is the best
fit.

Abstract: This paper proposes a Trans-XFed architecture that combines federated
learning with explainable AI techniques for supply chain credit assessment. The
proposed model aims to address several key challenges, including privacy,
information silos, class imbalance, non-identically and independently
distributed (Non-IID) data, and model interpretability in supply chain credit
assessment. We introduce a performance-based client selection strategy (PBCS)
to tackle class imbalance and Non-IID problems. This strategy achieves faster
convergence by selecting clients with higher local F1 scores. The FedProx
architecture, enhanced with homomorphic encryption, is used as the core model,
and further incorporates a transformer encoder. The transformer encoder block
provides insights into the learned features. Additionally, we employ the
integrated gradient explainable AI technique to offer insights into
decision-making. We demonstrate the effectiveness of Trans-XFed through
experimental evaluations on real-world supply chain datasets. The obtained
results show its ability to deliver accurate credit assessments compared to
several baselines, while maintaining transparency and privacy.

Conclusion: DREAMS方法能够有效平衡局部和全局结构保持，在多尺度数据可视化方面表现出优越性能，为高维数据可视化提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Dimensionality reduction techniques are widely used for visualizing
high-dimensional data in two dimensions. Existing methods are typically
designed to preserve either local (e.g. $t$-SNE, UMAP) or global (e.g. MDS,
PCA) structure of the data, but none of the established methods can represent
both aspects well. In this paper, we present DREAMS (Dimensionality Reduction
Enhanced Across Multiple Scales), a method that combines the local structure
preservation of $t$-SNE with the global structure preservation of PCA via a
simple regularization term. Our approach generates a spectrum of embeddings
between the locally well-structured $t$-SNE embedding and the globally
well-structured PCA embedding, efficiently balancing both local and global
structure preservation. We benchmark DREAMS across seven real-world datasets,
including five from single-cell transcriptomics and one from population
genetics, showcasing qualitatively and quantitatively its superior ability to
preserve structure across multiple scales compared to previous approaches.

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the problem of sequential decision-making for
Sharpe ratio (SR) maximization in a stochastic bandit setting. We focus on the
Thompson Sampling (TS) algorithm, a Bayesian approach celebrated for its
empirical performance and exploration efficiency, under the assumption of
Gaussian rewards with unknown parameters. Unlike conventional bandit objectives
focusing on maximizing cumulative reward, Sharpe ratio optimization instead
introduces an inherent tradeoff between achieving high returns and controlling
risk, demanding careful exploration of both mean and variance. Our theoretical
contributions include a novel regret decomposition specifically designed for
the Sharpe ratio, highlighting the role of information acquisition about the
reward distribution in driving learning efficiency. Then, we establish
fundamental performance limits for the proposed algorithm \texttt{SRTS} in
terms of an upper bound on regret. We also derive the matching lower bound and
show the order-optimality. Our results show that Thompson Sampling achieves
logarithmic regret over time, with distribution-dependent factors capturing the
difficulty of distinguishing arms based on risk-adjusted performance. Empirical
simulations show that our algorithm significantly outperforms existing
algorithms.

Conclusion: 深度和广度是RLVR中正交的两个关键维度，适应性深度探索和大广度训练的结合能够充分发挥RLVR在推理任务上的潜力。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Reward (RLVR) has emerged as a
powerful paradigm for unlocking reasoning capabilities in large language
models, yet its full potential is hindered by two under-explored dimensions:
Depth-the hardest problem a model can sample; Breadth-the number of instances
consumed in a single iteration. We dissect the popular GRPO algorithm and
reveal a systematic bias: the cumulative-advantage disproportionately weights
samples with medium accuracy, while down-weighting the low-accuracy instances
that are crucial for pushing reasoning boundaries. To rectify the depth
neglect, we introduce Difficulty Adaptive Rollout Sampling (DARS), which
re-weights hard problems through targeted multi-stage rollouts, thereby
increasing the number of positive rollouts for hard problems. Empirically,
naively enlarging rollout size only accelerates convergence and even hurts
Pass@K. Our DARS, in contrast, delivers consistent Pass@K gains without extra
inference cost at convergence. Just as we adaptively expanded the depth of
exploration, we now ask whether aggressively scaling the breadth of training
data can further amplify reasoning gains. To this end, we intensely scale batch
size and replace PPO's mini-batch iterations with full-batch updates over
multiple epochs. Increasing breadth significantly enhances Pass@1 performance.
Large-breadth training sustains high token-level entropy, indicating continued
exploration and reduced gradient noise. We further present DARS-B, which
augments DARS with large breadth, and demonstrate simultaneous gains in Pass@K
and Pass@1. The results confirm that breadth and adaptive exploration across
depth operate as orthogonal dimensions in RLVR, which are key to unleashing the
reasoning power of RLVR.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新的时间序列预测模型PENGUIN，通过周期嵌套组注意力机制显式建模周期模式，在多个标准数据集上都超过了现有的MLP和Transformer模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然Transformer模型在预测任务中取得了重要突破，但其在时间序列预测中的有效性仍存在争议。论文重新考察了自注意力机制的重要性，并提出显式建模周期模式的必要性。

Method: 提出周期嵌套相对注意偏置，直接捐捕周期结构。为处理多种共存周期性（如日周期和周周期），设计了分组注意力机制，每个组使用多查询注意力机制针对特定周期性。

Result: 在多种异质性标准数据集上进行了大量实验，结果表明PENGUIN一贯地超过了基于MLP和Transformer的模型。

Conclusion: 这种简单但有效的周期嵌套组注意力机制能够显著提升长期时间序列预测的性能，显示了显式建模周期模式的重要性。

Abstract: Long-term time series forecasting (LTSF) is a fundamental task with
wide-ranging applications. Although Transformer-based models have made
significant breakthroughs in forecasting, their effectiveness for time series
forecasting remains debatable. In this paper, we revisit the significance of
self-attention and propose a simple yet effective mechanism, Periodic-Nested
Group Attention, namely PENGUIN. Our approach highlights the importance of
explicitly modeling periodic patterns and incorporating relative attention bias
for effective time series modeling. To this end, we introduce a periodic-nested
relative attention bias that captures periodic structures directly. To handle
multiple coexisting periodicities (e.g., daily and weekly cycles), we design a
grouped attention mechanism, where each group targets a specific periodicity
using a multi-query attention mechanism. Extensive experiments across diverse
benchmarks demonstrate that PENGUIN consistently outperforms both MLP-based and
Transformer-based models.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种称为ISP的自适应机制，通过动态选择每轮训练的客户端数量来提高联邦学习的通信效率，在保持模型准确性的同时节省30%的通信开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着深度学习模型的快速扩展，联邦学习作为分布式训练框架虽然有希望，但通信效率仍是关键瓶颈，尤其在异构和动态客户端参与的情况下。现有方法如FedAvg和FedProx等对选择每轮客户端数量的问题研究不够。

Method: 提出了智能参与者选择（ISP）机制，这是一种自适应机制，能够动态地确定每轮训练的最优客户端数量。该方法在多种设置下进行了验证，包括视觉Transformer、真实世界ECG分类以及使用梯度压缩的训练。

Result: 结果显示ISP能够一致地节省达30%的通信开销，而不会影响最终模型质量。在不同的真实世界ECG分类设置中应用ISP，证明了选择客户端数量是联邦学习中一个独立的重要任务。

Conclusion: 论文证明了动态选择客户端数量在联邦学习中的重要性，ISP机制能够在不抑制模型性能的前提下显著提高通信效率，为解决联邦学习中的通信瓶颈提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Rapid scaling of deep learning models has enabled performance gains across
domains, yet it introduced several challenges. Federated Learning (FL) has
emerged as a promising framework to address these concerns by enabling
decentralized training. Nevertheless, communication efficiency remains a key
bottleneck in FL, particularly under heterogeneous and dynamic client
participation. Existing methods, such as FedAvg and FedProx, or other
approaches, including client selection strategies, attempt to mitigate
communication costs. However, the problem of choosing the number of clients in
a training round remains extremely underexplored. We introduce Intelligent
Selection of Participants (ISP), an adaptive mechanism that dynamically
determines the optimal number of clients per round to enhance communication
efficiency without compromising model accuracy. We validate the effectiveness
of ISP across diverse setups, including vision transformers, real-world ECG
classification, and training with gradient compression. Our results show
consistent communication savings of up to 30\% without losing the final
quality. Applying ISP to different real-world ECG classification setups
highlighted the selection of the number of clients as a separate task of
federated learning.

Conclusion: 该框架为AI训练数据集的可信质性评估提供了首个形式化方法，特别在处理数据集层面属性时显示出优势。

Abstract: As AI systems increasingly rely on training data, assessing dataset
trustworthiness has become critical, particularly for properties like fairness
or bias that emerge at the dataset level. Prior work has used Subjective Logic
to assess trustworthiness of individual data, but not to evaluate
trustworthiness properties that emerge only at the level of the dataset as a
whole. This paper introduces the first formal framework for assessing the
trustworthiness of AI training datasets, enabling uncertainty-aware evaluations
of global properties such as bias. Built on Subjective Logic, our approach
supports trust propositions and quantifies uncertainty in scenarios where
evidence is incomplete, distributed, and/or conflicting. We instantiate this
framework on the trustworthiness property of bias, and we experimentally
evaluate it based on a traffic sign recognition dataset. The results
demonstrate that our method captures class imbalance and remains interpretable
and robust in both centralized and federated contexts.

Abstract: Imbalanced distribution learning is a common and significant challenge in
predictive modeling, often reducing the performance of standard algorithms.
Although various approaches address this issue, most are tailored to
classification problems, with a limited focus on regression. This paper
introduces a novel method to improve learning on tabular data within the
Imbalanced Regression (IR) framework, which is a critical problem. We propose
using Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) to model and define a latent
representation of data distributions. However, VAEs can be inefficient with
imbalanced data like other standard approaches. To address this, we develop an
innovative data generation method that combines a disentangled VAE with a
Smoothed Bootstrap applied in the latent space. We evaluate the efficiency of
this method through numerical comparisons with competitors on benchmark
datasets for IR.

Conclusion: 研究为从业者根据目标和约束条件选择剪枝策略提供了有价值的见解，混合方法在某些场景下可以超越传统方法。

Abstract: Pruning is a core technique for compressing neural networks to improve
computational efficiency. This process is typically approached in two ways:
one-shot pruning, which involves a single pass of training and pruning, and
iterative pruning, where pruning is performed over multiple cycles for
potentially finer network refinement. Although iterative pruning has
historically seen broader adoption, this preference is often assumed rather
than rigorously tested. Our study presents one of the first systematic and
comprehensive comparisons of these methods, providing rigorous definitions,
benchmarking both across structured and unstructured settings, and applying
different pruning criteria and modalities. We find that each method has
specific advantages: one-shot pruning proves more effective at lower pruning
ratios, while iterative pruning performs better at higher ratios. Building on
these findings, we advocate for patience-based pruning and introduce a hybrid
approach that can outperform traditional methods in certain scenarios,
providing valuable insights for practitioners selecting a pruning strategy
tailored to their goals and constraints. Source code is available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FedUP是一种轻量级的联邦遗忘算法，通过剪枝特定连接来高效消除恶意客户端对全局模型的影响，无需完全重新训练，在保持良性数据性能的同时有效降低恶意数据准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习容易受到模型投毒攻击，传统联邦遗忘假设客户端可信合作，但在恶意客户端可能共谋的场景下无法依赖其配合进行数据遗忘，需要新的解决方案。

Method: FedUP利用最后一轮训练中客户端的权重，通过选择并置零良性客户端和恶意客户端更新之间差异最大的高幅值权重来剪枝特定连接，从而隔离恶意影响。

Result: 在IID和非IID数据、标签翻转和后门攻击等多种场景下，FedUP能有效降低恶意影响，将恶意数据准确率降至与从头训练模型相当的水平，同时保持良性数据性能，且比现有方法更快、更节省存储。

Conclusion: FedUP提供了一种高效、鲁棒的联邦遗忘解决方案，能够在恶意客户端存在且可能共谋的情况下有效消除其影响，为联邦学习安全性提供了重要保障。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) can be vulnerable to attacks, such as model
poisoning, where adversaries send malicious local weights to compromise the
global model. Federated Unlearning (FU) is emerging as a solution to address
such vulnerabilities by selectively removing the influence of detected
malicious contributors on the global model without complete retraining.
However, unlike typical FU scenarios where clients are trusted and cooperative,
applying FU with malicious and possibly colluding clients is challenging
because their collaboration in unlearning their data cannot be assumed. This
work presents FedUP, a lightweight FU algorithm designed to efficiently
mitigate malicious clients' influence by pruning specific connections within
the attacked model. Our approach achieves efficiency by relying only on
clients' weights from the last training round before unlearning to identify
which connections to inhibit. Isolating malicious influence is non-trivial due
to overlapping updates from benign and malicious clients. FedUP addresses this
by carefully selecting and zeroing the highest magnitude weights that diverge
the most between the latest updates from benign and malicious clients while
preserving benign information. FedUP is evaluated under a strong adversarial
threat model, where up to 50%-1 of the clients could be malicious and have full
knowledge of the aggregation process. We demonstrate the effectiveness,
robustness, and efficiency of our solution through experiments across IID and
Non-IID data, under label-flipping and backdoor attacks, and by comparing it
with state-of-the-art (SOTA) FU solutions. In all scenarios, FedUP reduces
malicious influence, lowering accuracy on malicious data to match that of a
model retrained from scratch while preserving performance on benign data. FedUP
achieves effective unlearning while consistently being faster and saving
storage compared to the SOTA.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of authentication systems and their increasing reliance
on biometrics for faster and more accurate user verification experience,
highlight the critical need for a reliable framework to evaluate the
suitability of biometric modalities for specific applications. Currently, the
most widely known evaluation framework is a comparative table from 1998, which
no longer adequately captures recent technological developments or emerging
vulnerabilities in biometric systems. To address these challenges, this work
revisits the evaluation of biometric modalities through an expert survey
involving 24 biometric specialists. The findings indicate substantial shifts in
property ratings across modalities. For example, face recognition, shows
improved ratings due to technological progress, while fingerprint, shows
decreased reliability because of emerging vulnerabilities and attacks. Further
analysis of expert agreement levels across rated properties highlighted the
consistency of the provided evaluations and ensured the reliability of the
ratings. Finally, expert assessments are compared with dataset-level
uncertainty across 55 biometric datasets, revealing strong alignment in most
modalities and underscoring the importance of integrating empirical evidence
with expert insight. Moreover, the identified expert disagreements reveal key
open challenges and help guide future research toward resolving them.

Motivation: 现代GPU支持大批量训练，但现有优化器在大批量下表现不佳：一阶方法梯度噪声减少难以逃离局部极小值，二阶方法需要过高阻尼而失去曲率信息优势。

Method: Fisher正交投影(FOP)利用两个子批次的梯度，在Fisher度量下将梯度差异的正交分量增强平均梯度，构建方差感知更新方向。

Result: FOP能够在大批量下恢复二阶方法的有效性，实现可扩展训练，提高泛化能力并加速收敛。

Conclusion: FOP技术解决了大批量训练中优化器性能下降的问题，使二阶方法在大批量下仍能保持优势。

Abstract: Modern GPUs are equipped with large amounts of high-bandwidth memory,
enabling them to support mini-batch sizes of up to tens of thousands of
training samples. However, most existing optimizers struggle to perform
effectively at such a large batch size. As batch size increases, gradient noise
decreases due to averaging over many samples, limiting the ability of
first-order methods to escape sharp or suboptimal minima and reach the global
minimum. Meanwhile, second-order methods like the natural gradient with
Kronecker-Factored Approximate Curvature (KFAC) often require excessively high
damping to remain stable at large batch sizes. This high damping effectively
washes out the curvature information that gives these methods their advantage,
reducing their performance to that of simple gradient descent. In this paper,
we introduce Fisher-Orthogonal Projection (FOP), a novel technique that
restores the effectiveness of the second-order method at very large batch
sizes, enabling scalable training with improved generalization and faster
convergence. FOP constructs a variance-aware update direction by leveraging
gradients from two sub-batches, enhancing the average gradient with a component
of the gradient difference that is orthogonal to the average under the
Fisher-metric.

Motivation: Diffusion Q-Learning (DQL)在离线强化学习中表现出色，但其依赖多步去噪进行动作生成，导致训练和推理效率低下。虽然单步去噪更理想，但直接应用于DQL会导致性能急剧下降

Method: 将DQL重新构建在Flow Matching框架中，学习平均速度场而非传统Flow Matching的弯曲生成轨迹，从而实现直接准确的单步动作生成，无需辅助模型、蒸馏或多阶段训练

Result: 在D4RL基准测试中，OFQL超越了DQL和其他基于扩散的基线方法，同时相比DQL大幅减少了训练和推理时间

Conclusion: OFQL成功解决了DQL的效率瓶颈，通过Flow Matching框架实现了高效的单步动作生成，为扩散模型在强化学习中的应用提供了更实用的解决方案

Abstract: The generative power of diffusion models (DMs) has recently enabled
high-performing decision-making algorithms in offline reinforcement learning
(RL), achieving state-of-the-art results across standard benchmarks. Among
them, Diffusion Q-Learning (DQL) stands out as a leading method for its
consistently strong performance. Nevertheless, DQL remains limited in practice
due to its reliance on multi-step denoising for action generation during both
training and inference. Although one-step denoising is desirable, simply
applying it to DQL leads to a drastic performance drop. In this work, we
revisit DQL and identify its core limitations. We then propose One-Step Flow
Q-Learning (OFQL), a novel framework that enables efficient one-step action
generation during both training and inference, without requiring auxiliary
models, distillation, or multi-phase training. Specifically, OFQL reformulates
DQL within the sample-efficient Flow Matching (FM) framework. While
conventional FM induces curved generative trajectories that impede one-step
generation, OFQL instead learns an average velocity field that facilitates
direct, accurate action generation. Collectively, OFQL eliminates the need for
multi-step sampling and recursive gradient updates in DQL, resulting in faster
and more robust training and inference. Extensive experiments on the D4RL
benchmark demonstrate that OFQL outperforms DQL and other diffusion-based
baselines, while substantially reducing both training and inference time
compared to DQL.

Abstract: Extreme weather events, intensified by climate change, increasingly challenge
aging combined sewer systems, raising the risk of untreated wastewater
overflow. Accurate forecasting of sewer overflow basin filling levels can
provide actionable insights for early intervention, helping mitigating
uncontrolled discharge. In recent years, AI-based forecasting methods have
offered scalable alternatives to traditional physics-based models, but their
reliance on cloud computing limits their reliability during communication
outages. To address this, we propose an end-to-end forecasting framework that
enables energy-efficient inference directly on edge devices. Our solution
integrates lightweight Transformer and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models,
compressed via integer-only quantization for efficient on-device execution.
Moreover, an automated hardware-aware deployment pipeline is used to search for
optimal model configurations by jointly minimizing prediction error and energy
consumption on an AMD Spartan-7 XC7S15 FPGA. Evaluated on real-world sewer
data, the selected 8-bit Transformer model, trained on 24 hours of historical
measurements, achieves high accuracy (MSE 0.0376) at an energy cost of 0.370 mJ
per inference. In contrast, the optimal 8-bit LSTM model requires significantly
less energy (0.009 mJ, over 40x lower) but yields 14.89% worse accuracy (MSE
0.0432) and much longer training time. This trade-off highlights the need to
align model selection with deployment priorities, favoring LSTM for ultra-low
energy consumption or Transformer for higher predictive accuracy. In general,
our work enables local, energy-efficient forecasting, contributing to more
resilient combined sewer systems. All code can be found in the GitHub

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统深度强化学习策略通常使用高斯分布参数化，限制了学习到的行为是单模态的。而许多实际决策问题需要多模态策略来促进环境探索，解决稀疏奖励、复杂动态等挑战

Method: 引入分类策略，使用中间分类分布建模多模态行为模式，然后基于采样的模式生成输出动作。探索了两种采样方案确保可微分离散潜在结构，同时保持基于梯度的优化效率

Result: 在DeepMind Control Suite环境中评估，通过更好的探索，学习到的策略收敛更快且优于标准高斯策略

Conclusion: 分类分布是连续控制中结构化探索和多模态行为表示的强大工具

Abstract: A policy in deep reinforcement learning (RL), either deterministic or
stochastic, is commonly parameterized as a Gaussian distribution alone,
limiting the learned behavior to be unimodal. However, the nature of many
practical decision-making problems favors a multimodal policy that facilitates
robust exploration of the environment and thus to address learning challenges
arising from sparse rewards, complex dynamics, or the need for strategic
adaptation to varying contexts. This issue is exacerbated in continuous control
domains where exploration usually takes place in the vicinity of the predicted
optimal action, either through an additive Gaussian noise or the sampling
process of a stochastic policy. In this paper, we introduce Categorical
Policies to model multimodal behavior modes with an intermediate categorical
distribution, and then generate output action that is conditioned on the
sampled mode. We explore two sampling schemes that ensure differentiable
discrete latent structure while maintaining efficient gradient-based
optimization. By utilizing a latent categorical distribution to select the
behavior mode, our approach naturally expresses multimodality while remaining
fully differentiable via the sampling tricks. We evaluate our multimodal policy
on a set of DeepMind Control Suite environments, demonstrating that through
better exploration, our learned policies converge faster and outperform
standard Gaussian policies. Our results indicate that the Categorical
distribution serves as a powerful tool for structured exploration and
multimodal behavior representation in continuous control.

Abstract: Tabular data, consisting of rows and columns, is omnipresent across various
machine learning applications. Each column represents a feature, and features
can be combined or transformed to create new, more informative features. Such
feature engineering is essential to achieve peak performance in machine
learning. Since manual feature engineering is expensive and time-consuming, a
substantial effort has been put into automating it. Yet, existing automated
feature engineering (AutoFE) methods have never been investigated regarding
their usability for practitioners. Thus, we investigated 53 AutoFE methods. We
found that these methods are, in general, hard to use, lack documentation, and
have no active communities. Furthermore, no method allows users to set time and
memory constraints, which we see as a necessity for usable automation. Our
survey highlights the need for future work on usable, well-engineered AutoFE
methods.

Abstract: In this paper we propose two algorithms in the tabular setting and an
algorithm for the function approximation setting for the Stochastic Shortest
Path (SSP) problem. SSP problems form an important class of problems in
Reinforcement Learning (RL), as other types of cost-criteria in RL can be
formulated in the setting of SSP. We show asymptotic almost-sure convergence
for all our algorithms. We observe superior performance of our tabular
algorithms compared to other well-known convergent RL algorithms. We further
observe reliable performance of our function approximation algorithm compared
to other algorithms in the function approximation setting.

TL;DR: AutoScale是一个无需昂贵权重搜索的两阶段框架，利用多任务优化指标来指导线性标量化中的权重选择，在多个数据集上展现出优越性能和高效率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然固定权重的线性标量化方法在某些情况下能达到甚至超过复杂多任务优化方法的性能，但最优权重的选择原因和确定方法仍不明确，需要避免耗尽的超参数搜索

Method: 提出了AutoScale两阶段框架：首先分析表现良好的标量化权重在多任务优化指标（如梯度幅度相似性）上的特定趋势，然后利用这些指标来指导权重选择

Result: AutoScale在包括新的大规模基准测试在内的多样化数据集上，始终展现出优越的性能和高效率

Conclusion: 通过建立线性标量化与多任务优化方法之间的直接联系，并利用关键MTO指标来指导权重选择，可以避免昂贵的权重搜索同时获得优异性能

Abstract: Recent multi-task learning studies suggest that linear scalarization, when
using well-chosen fixed task weights, can achieve comparable to or even better
performance than complex multi-task optimization (MTO) methods. It remains
unclear why certain weights yield optimal performance and how to determine
these weights without relying on exhaustive hyperparameter search. This paper
establishes a direct connection between linear scalarization and MTO methods,
revealing through extensive experiments that well-performing scalarization
weights exhibit specific trends in key MTO metrics, such as high gradient
magnitude similarity. Building on this insight, we introduce AutoScale, a
simple yet effective two-phase framework that uses these MTO metrics to guide
weight selection for linear scalarization, without expensive weight search.
AutoScale consistently shows superior performance with high efficiency across
diverse datasets including a new large-scale benchmark.

Abstract: We introduce a Multi-User Contextual Cascading Bandit model, a new
combinatorial bandit framework that captures realistic online advertising
scenarios where multiple users interact with sequentially displayed items
simultaneously. Unlike classical contextual bandits, MCCB integrates three key
structural elements: (i) cascading feedback based on sequential arm exposure,
(ii) parallel context sessions enabling selective exploration, and (iii)
heterogeneous arm-level rewards. We first propose Upper Confidence Bound with
Backward Planning (UCBBP), a UCB-style algorithm tailored to this setting, and
prove that it achieves a regret bound of $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{THN})$ over $T$
episodes, $H$ session steps, and $N$ contexts per episode. Motivated by the
fact that many users interact with the system simultaneously, we introduce a
second algorithm, termed Active Upper Confidence Bound with Backward Planning
(AUCBBP), which shows a strict efficiency improvement in context scaling, i.e.,
user scaling, with a regret bound of $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{T+HN})$. We validate
our theoretical findings via numerical experiments, demonstrating the empirical
effectiveness of both algorithms under various settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习模型效率优化方法多样且分散，缺乏统一的表示和推理框架，难以系统组合和比较不同技术。

Method: 提出KMR三元组框架（旋钮-仪表-规则），将各种效率技术抽象为统一表示，并开发Budgeted-KMR算法进行迭代预算优化。

Result: 成功将知名效率方法实例化为KMR三元组，揭示了方法间的内在联系，支持混合流水线构建。

Conclusion: KMR为模型效率研究提供了概念和实践工具，为自动化策略学习、动态适应和理论分析奠定了基础。

Abstract: We introduce the Knob-Meter-Rule (KMR) framework, a unified formalism for
representing and reasoning about model efficiency techniques in deep learning.
By abstracting diverse methods, including pruning, quantization, knowledge
distillation, and parameter-efficient architectures, into a consistent set of
controllable knobs, deterministic rules, and measurable meters, KMR provides a
mathematically precise and modular perspective on efficiency optimization. The
framework enables systematic composition of multiple techniques, flexible
policy-driven application, and iterative budgeted optimization through the
Budgeted-KMR algorithm. We demonstrate how well-known efficiency methods can be
instantiated as KMR triples and present concise algorithmic templates for each.
The framework highlights underlying relationships between methods, facilitates
hybrid pipelines, and lays the foundation for future research in automated
policy learning, dynamic adaptation, and theoretical analysis of cost-quality
trade-offs. Overall, KMR offers both a conceptual and practical tool for
unifying and advancing model efficiency research.

Conclusion: ASDFormer不仅提高了自闭症诊断的准确性，还提供了可解释的生物标记发现能力，为自闭症研究提供了有力的工具

Abstract: Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a complex neurodevelopmental condition
marked by disruptions in brain connectivity. Functional MRI (fMRI) offers a
non-invasive window into large-scale neural dynamics by measuring
blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) signals across the brain. These signals can
be modeled as interactions among Regions of Interest (ROIs), which are grouped
into functional communities based on their underlying roles in brain function.
Emerging evidence suggests that connectivity patterns within and between these
communities are particularly sensitive to ASD-related alterations. Effectively
capturing these patterns and identifying interactions that deviate from typical
development is essential for improving ASD diagnosis and enabling biomarker
discovery. In this work, we introduce ASDFormer, a Transformer-based
architecture that incorporates a Mixture of Pooling-Classifier Experts (MoE) to
capture neural signatures associated with ASD. By integrating multiple
specialized expert branches with attention mechanisms, ASDFormer adaptively
emphasizes different brain regions and connectivity patterns relevant to
autism. This enables both improved classification performance and more
interpretable identification of disorder-related biomarkers. Applied to the
ABIDE dataset, ASDFormer achieves state-of-the-art diagnostic accuracy and
reveals robust insights into functional connectivity disruptions linked to ASD,
highlighting its potential as a tool for biomarker discovery.

Conclusion: 类型拓扑方法为数据集分析提供了新的拓扑学视角，所构建的结构化表示平台能够支持凸包计算、孔洞检测、聚类和异常检测等算法的开发。

Abstract: A datatset $X$ on $R^2$ is a finite topological space. Current research of a
dataset focuses on statistical methods and the algebraic topological method
\cite{carlsson}. In \cite{hu}, the concept of typed topological space was
introduced and showed to have the potential for studying finite topological
spaces, such as a dataset. It is a new method from the general topology
perspective. A typed topological space is a topological space whose open sets
are assigned types. Topological concepts and methods can be redefined using
open sets of certain types. In this article, we develop a special set of types
and its related typed topology on a dataset $X$. Using it, we can investigate
the inner structure of $X$. In particular, $R^2$ has a natural quotient space,
in which $X$ is organized into tracks, and each track is split into components.
Those components are in a order. Further, they can be represented by an integer
sequence. Components crossing tracks form branches, and the relationship can be
well represented by a type of pseudotree (called typed-II pseudotree). Such
structures provide a platform for new algorithms for problems such as
calculating convex hull, holes, clustering and anomaly detection.

Abstract: Due to regulations like the Right to be Forgotten, there is growing demand
for removing training data and its influence from models. Since full retraining
is costly, various machine unlearning methods have been proposed. In this
paper, we firstly present an efficient knowledge graph (KG) unlearning
algorithm. We remark that KG unlearning is nontrivial due to the distinctive
structure of KG and the semantic relations between entities. Also, unlearning
by estimating the influence of removed components incurs significant
computational overhead when applied to large-scale knowledge graphs. To this
end, we define an influence function for KG unlearning and propose to
approximate the model's sensitivity without expensive computation of
first-order and second-order derivatives for parameter updates. Specifically,
we use Taylor expansion to estimate the parameter changes caused by data
removal. Given that the first-order gradients and second-order derivatives
dominate the computational load, we use the Fisher matrices and zeroth-order
optimization to approximate the inverse-Hessian vector product without
constructing the computational graphs. Our experimental results demonstrate
that the proposed method outperforms other state-of-the-art graph unlearning
baselines significantly in terms of unlearning efficiency and unlearning
quality. Our code is released at https://github.com/NKUShaw/ZOWFKGIF.

Motivation: 传统机器学习原子间势能模型在分布外数据和数据稀缺场景下预测不准确，且缺乏不确定性估计，无法指导主动学习和确保模拟精度

Method: 基于自适应变分dropout的可扩展架构无关变分贝叶斯框架，可训练或微调现有MLIPs，兼容等变消息传递架构

Conclusion: BLIP框架能够为MLIPs提供校准的不确定性估计，在推理时计算开销最小，微调预训练模型可获得持续性能提升

Abstract: Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials (MLIPs) are becoming a central tool
in simulation-based chemistry. However, like most deep learning models, MLIPs
struggle to make accurate predictions on out-of-distribution data or when
trained in a data-scarce regime, both common scenarios in simulation-based
chemistry. Moreover, MLIPs do not provide uncertainty estimates by
construction, which are fundamental to guide active learning pipelines and to
ensure the accuracy of simulation results compared to quantum calculations. To
address this shortcoming, we propose BLIPs: Bayesian Learned Interatomic
Potentials. BLIP is a scalable, architecture-agnostic variational Bayesian
framework for training or fine-tuning MLIPs, built on an adaptive version of
Variational Dropout. BLIP delivers well-calibrated uncertainty estimates and
minimal computational overhead for energy and forces prediction at inference
time, while integrating seamlessly with (equivariant) message-passing
architectures. Empirical results on simulation-based computational chemistry
tasks demonstrate improved predictive accuracy with respect to standard MLIPs,
and trustworthy uncertainty estimates, especially in data-scarse or heavy
out-of-distribution regimes. Moreover, fine-tuning pretrained MLIPs with BLIP
yields consistent performance gains and calibrated uncertainties.

TL;DR: LEOPARD算法通过结合偏好反馈和专家演示来学习奖励函数，在有限数据下显著优于现有基线方法，证明了结合多种反馈类型的优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 强化学习在复杂任务中难以指定好的奖励函数，现有方法结合偏好和演示反馈往往不够灵活或难以扩展。

Method: 提出了reward-rational partial orderings框架，并开发了LEOPARD算法，能够从包括负面演示在内的多种人类数据中学习奖励函数。

Result: 在有限偏好和演示反馈下，LEOPARD显著优于现有基线方法，且结合多种反馈类型通常比单一反馈类型效果更好。

Conclusion: LEOPARD提供了一个灵活可扩展的框架来从人类数据中学习，证明了结合不同类型反馈的价值。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning is a general method for learning in sequential
settings, but it can often be difficult to specify a good reward function when
the task is complex. In these cases, preference feedback or expert
demonstrations can be used instead. However, existing approaches utilising both
together are often ad-hoc, rely on domain-specific properties, or won't scale.
We develop a new framing for learning from human data, \emph{reward-rational
partial orderings over observations}, designed to be flexible and scalable.
Based on this we introduce a practical algorithm, LEOPARD: Learning Estimated
Objectives from Preferences And Ranked Demonstrations. LEOPARD can learn from a
broad range of data, including negative demonstrations, to efficiently learn
reward functions across a wide range of domains. We find that when a limited
amount of preference and demonstration feedback is available, LEOPARD
outperforms existing baselines by a significant margin. Furthermore, we use
LEOPARD to investigate learning from many types of feedback compared to just a
single one, and find that combining feedback types is often beneficial.
