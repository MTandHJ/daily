### [1] [Label Smoothing++: Enhanced Label Regularization for Training Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05307)
*Sachin Chhabra,Hemanth Venkateswara,Baoxin Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Label Smoothing++是一种新的标签正则化训练策略，通过为非目标类别分配非零概率并考虑类间关系，解决了传统标签平滑方法破坏类间关系的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的标签平滑方法虽然能改善网络泛化能力，但为所有非目标类别分配相同的重要性，破坏了类间关系。需要一种既能缓解过拟合又能保持类间关系的方法。

Method: 提出Label Smoothing++方法，为目标类别使用固定标签，同时让网络学习非目标类别的标签，为非目标类别分配非零概率并考虑它们的类间关系。

Result: 在多个数据集上的广泛实验表明，Label Smoothing++能够缓解过自信预测，同时促进类间关系和泛化能力。

Conclusion: Label Smoothing++是一种有效的标签正则化策略，既能解决过拟合问题，又能保持类间关系，提高了神经网络的泛化性能。

Abstract: Training neural networks with one-hot target labels often results in
overconfidence and overfitting. Label smoothing addresses this issue by
perturbing the one-hot target labels by adding a uniform probability vector to
create a regularized label. Although label smoothing improves the network's
generalization ability, it assigns equal importance to all the non-target
classes, which destroys the inter-class relationships. In this paper, we
propose a novel label regularization training strategy called Label
Smoothing++, which assigns non-zero probabilities to non-target classes and
accounts for their inter-class relationships. Our approach uses a fixed label
for the target class while enabling the network to learn the labels associated
with non-target classes. Through extensive experiments on multiple datasets, we
demonstrate how Label Smoothing++ mitigates overconfident predictions while
promoting inter-class relationships and generalization capabilities.

Abstract: The advancement of Object Detection (OD) using Deep Learning (DL) is often
hindered by the significant challenge of acquiring large, accurately labeled
datasets, a process that is time-consuming and expensive. While techniques like
Active Learning (AL) can reduce annotation effort by intelligently querying
informative samples, they often lack transparency, limit the strategic insight
of human experts, and may overlook informative samples not aligned with an
employed query strategy. To mitigate these issues, Human-in-the-Loop (HITL)
approaches integrating human intelligence and intuition throughout the machine
learning life-cycle have gained traction. Leveraging Visual Analytics (VA),
effective interfaces can be created to facilitate this human-AI collaboration.
This thesis explores the intersection of these fields by developing and
investigating "VILOD: A Visual Interactive Labeling tool for Object Detection".
VILOD utilizes components such as a t-SNE projection of image features,
together with uncertainty heatmaps and model state views. Enabling users to
explore data, interpret model states, AL suggestions, and implement diverse
sample selection strategies within an iterative HITL workflow for OD. An
empirical investigation using comparative use cases demonstrated how VILOD,
through its interactive visualizations, facilitates the implementation of
distinct labeling strategies by making the model's state and dataset
characteristics more interpretable (RQ1). The study showed that different
visually-guided labeling strategies employed within VILOD result in competitive
OD performance trajectories compared to an automated uncertainty sampling AL
baseline (RQ2). This work contributes a novel tool and empirical insight into
making the HITL-AL workflow for OD annotation more transparent, manageable, and
potentially more effective.

### [3] [Context-Aware Knowledge Distillation with Adaptive Weighting for Image Classification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05319)
*Zhengda Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 通过学习参数alpha和上下文感知模块动态调整知识蓄粉中硬标签和软标签损失的权重，提高学生网络性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统知识蓄粉使用固定的alpha参数来平衡硬标签和软标签损失，但这种静态设置是次优的，因为最佳的权衡在训练过程中可能会发生变化

Method: 1. 将alpha作为可学习参数在训练中自动优化 2. 通过学生-教师差异动态计算alpha 3. 使用MLP+注意力机制的上下文感知模块(CAM)来适应地重新调整类别权重

Result: 在CIFAR-10数据集上，以ResNet-50为教师、ResNet-18为学生的实验表明，该方法比固定权重的知识蓄粉基准方法获得更高的准确率，并产生更稳定的收敛性能

Conclusion: 动态调整知识蓄粉中硬标签和软标签损失的权重比固定权重更有效，适应性知识蓄粉框架能够提高学生模型的性能和训练稳定性

Abstract: Knowledge distillation (KD) is a widely used technique to transfer knowledge
from a large teacher network to a smaller student model. Traditional KD uses a
fixed balancing factor alpha as a hyperparameter to combine the hard-label
cross-entropy loss with the soft-label distillation loss. However, a static
alpha is suboptimal because the optimal trade-off between hard and soft
supervision can vary during training.
  In this work, we propose an Adaptive Knowledge Distillation (AKD) framework.
First we try to make alpha as learnable parameter that can be automatically
learned and optimized during training. Then we introduce a formula to reflect
the gap between the student and the teacher to compute alpha dynamically,
guided by student-teacher discrepancies, and further introduce a Context-Aware
Module (CAM) using MLP + Attention to adaptively reweight class-wise teacher
outputs. Experiments on CIFAR-10 with ResNet-50 as teacher and ResNet-18 as
student demonstrate that our approach achieves superior accuracy compared to
fixed-weight KD baselines, and yields more stable convergence.

analysis, data augmentation, and brain-computer interface applications, with
substantial research and engineering significance.

*Pavithra Elumalai,Sudharsan Vijayaraghavan,Madhumita Mondal,Areejit Samal*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究比较了三种边中心网络度量（FRC、ORC、EBC）在随机有线神经网络中的剪枝效果，发现计算效率更高的FRC能达到与ORC相当的剪枝性能，同时保持网络准确性和结构特性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索不同网络拓扑结构对深度学习性能的影响，寻找计算效率更高的网络剪枝方法，在保持模型性能的同时降低网络复杂度。

Method: 使用三种边中心网络度量（Forman-Ricci曲率、Ollivier-Ricci曲率、边介数中心性）对三种随机网络生成器（ER、WS、BA模型）生成的RWNN进行选择性剪枝，应用于COVID-19胸片图像分类任务。

Result: FRC基于剪枝能有效简化RWNN，在保持与ORC相当性能的同时提供显著的计算优势，压缩后的网络在模块化和全局效率之间达到平衡。

Conclusion: 计算效率更高的FRC可以作为ORC的有效替代方案进行网络剪枝，为神经网络压缩提供了新的有效工具，同时揭示了压缩网络中模块化分离与网络效率之间的权衡关系。

Abstract: Randomly Wired Neural Networks (RWNNs) serve as a valuable testbed for
investigating the impact of network topology in deep learning by capturing how
different connectivity patterns impact both learning efficiency and model
performance. At the same time, they provide a natural framework for exploring
edge-centric network measures as tools for pruning and optimization. In this
study, we investigate three edge-centric network measures: Forman-Ricci
curvature (FRC), Ollivier-Ricci curvature (ORC), and edge betweenness
centrality (EBC), to compress RWNNs by selectively retaining important synapses
(or edges) while pruning the rest. As a baseline, RWNNs are trained for
COVID-19 chest x-ray image classification, aiming to reduce network complexity
while preserving performance in terms of accuracy, specificity, and
sensitivity. We extend prior work on pruning RWNN using ORC by incorporating
two additional edge-centric measures, FRC and EBC, across three network
generators: Erd\"{o}s-R\'{e}nyi (ER) model, Watts-Strogatz (WS) model, and
Barab\'{a}si-Albert (BA) model. We provide a comparative analysis of the
pruning performance of the three measures in terms of compression ratio and
theoretical speedup. A central focus of our study is to evaluate whether FRC,
which is computationally more efficient than ORC, can achieve comparable
pruning effectiveness. Along with performance evaluation, we further
investigate the structural properties of the pruned networks through modularity
and global efficiency, offering insights into the trade-off between modular
segregation and network efficiency in compressed RWNNs. Our results provide
initial evidence that FRC-based pruning can effectively simplify RWNNs,
offering significant computational advantages while maintaining performance
comparable to ORC.

Abstract: In this paper, we address the challenge of Optical Music Recognition (OMR)
for handwritten jazz lead sheets, a widely used musical score type that encodes
melody and chords. The task is challenging due to the presence of chords, a
score component not handled by existing OMR systems, and the high variability
and quality issues associated with handwritten images. Our contribution is
two-fold. We present a novel dataset consisting of 293 handwritten jazz lead
sheets of 163 unique pieces, amounting to 2021 total staves aligned with
Humdrum **kern and MusicXML ground truth scores. We also supply synthetic score
images generated from the ground truth. The second contribution is the
development of an OMR model for jazz lead sheets. We discuss specific
tokenisation choices related to our kind of data, and the advantages of using
synthetic scores and pretrained models. We publicly release all code, data, and
models.

### [7] [RT-VLM: Re-Thinking Vision Language Model with 4-Clues for Real-World Object Recognition Robustness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05333)
*Junghyun Park,Tuan Anh Nguyen,Dugki Min*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RT-VLM框架通过合成数据集和两阶段推理机制，有效提升目标识别模型在域偏移下的鲁棒性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实部署中目标识别模型面临多种域偏移（图像统计变化、姿态变化、遮挡、类别混淆）导致准确率严重下降，需要提高模型鲁棒性

Method: 构建合成数据集生成管道产生带"4线索"标注的图像（边界框、类别名、对象级描述、场景级描述），对Llama 3.2 11B Vision Instruct进行参数高效监督微调，推理时采用两阶段重思考机制

Result: 在隔离单个域偏移的鲁棒性基准测试中，RT-VLM持续超越强基线模型

Conclusion: 结构化多模态证据与显式自批判循环的结合是实现可靠可迁移视觉理解的有前景路径

Abstract: Real world deployments often expose modern object recognition models to
domain shifts that precipitate a severe drop in accuracy. Such shifts encompass
(i) variations in low level image statistics, (ii) changes in object pose and
viewpoint, (iii) partial occlusion, and (iv) visual confusion across adjacent
classes. To mitigate this degradation, we introduce the Re-Thinking Vision
Language Model (RT-VLM) framework. The foundation of this framework is a unique
synthetic dataset generation pipeline that produces images annotated with
"4-Clues": precise bounding boxes, class names, detailed object-level captions,
and a comprehensive context-level caption for the entire scene. We then perform
parameter efficient supervised tuning of Llama 3.2 11B Vision Instruct on this
resource. At inference time, a two stage Re-Thinking scheme is executed: the
model first emits its own four clues, then re examines these responses as
evidence and iteratively corrects them. Across robustness benchmarks that
isolate individual domain shifts, RT-VLM consistently surpasses strong
baselines. These findings indicate that the integration of structured
multimodal evidence with an explicit self critique loop constitutes a promising
route toward reliable and transferable visual understanding.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统运动性能测量技术质明缺乏、成本高、复杂的问题，为羽毛球运动员提供可达的性能分析工具

Method: 采用自定义训练的YOLOv5模型进行羽毛球检测，结合Kalman筛波实现稳健轨迹跟踪，通过视频基于动力学的速度估计方法进行时空缩放

Result: 开发了一个直观易用的移动应用程序，能够自动从标准视频录制中计算羽毛球速度

Abstract: Performance metrics in sports, such as shot speed and angle, provide crucial
feedback for athlete development. However, the technology to capture these
metrics has historically been expensive, complex, and largely inaccessible to
amateur and recreational players. This paper addresses this gap in the context
of badminton, one of the world's most popular sports, by introducing a novel,
cost-effective, and user-friendly system for measuring smash speed using
ubiquitous smartphone technology. Our approach leverages a custom-trained
YOLOv5 model for shuttlecock detection, combined with a Kalman filter for
robust trajectory tracking. By implementing a video-based kinematic speed
estimation method with spatiotemporal scaling, the system automatically
calculates the shuttlecock's velocity from a standard video recording. The
entire process is packaged into an intuitive mobile application, democratizing
access to high-level performance analytics and empowering players at all levels
to analyze and improve their game.

*Zebo Xu,Shaoyun Yu,Mark Torrance,Guido Nottbusch,Nan Zhao,Zhenguang Cai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文构建了中文手写数据库和开放工具包，通过大规模实验发现词汇形、音、义因素在字符、部首和笔画层次对手写准备和执行的层级性影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决中文手写研究中语言组件影响不清和缺乏细粒度数据处理工具的问题，构建大规模手写数据库和完善的分析工具。

Method: 42名中文语者写入1200个字符，使用升级的OpenHandWrite_Toolbox工具包捕捉笔画轨迹和批量处理手写测量数据，采用多元回归分析语言因素影响。

Result: 词形因素在字符、部首和笔画层面影响手写准备和执行，词音因素在所有三个层次影响执行。词汇效应呈现层级衰减特征：字符层最明显，部首层次之，笔画层最弱。

Conclusion: 部首和笔画层面的手写准备和执行与语言组件密切相关，该数据库和工具包为语言学和神经语言学手写研究提供了价值贵的资源。

Abstract: Understanding what linguistic components (e.g., phonological, semantic, and
orthographic systems) modulate Chinese handwriting at the character, radical,
and stroke levels remains an important yet understudied topic. Additionally,
there is a lack of comprehensive tools for capturing and batch-processing
fine-grained handwriting data. To address these issues, we constructed a
large-scale handwriting database in which 42 Chinese speakers for each
handwriting 1200 characters in a handwriting-to-dictation task. Additionally,
we enhanced the existing handwriting package and provided comprehensive
documentation for the upgraded OpenHandWrite_Toolbox, which can easily modify
the experimental design, capture the stroke-level handwriting trajectory, and
batch-process handwriting measurements (e.g., latency, duration, and
pen-pressure). In analysing our large-scale database, multiple regression
results show that orthographic predictors impact handwriting preparation and
execution across character, radical, and stroke levels. Phonological factors
also influence execution at all three levels. Importantly, these lexical
effects demonstrate hierarchical attenuation - they were most pronounced at the
character level, followed by the radical, and were weakest at the stroke
levels. These findings demonstrate that handwriting preparation and execution
at the radical and stroke levels are closely intertwined with linguistic
components. This database and toolbox offer valuable resources for future
psycholinguistic and neurolinguistic research on the handwriting of characters
and sub-characters across different languages.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合动态图神经网络和LSTM的混合模型，用于预测跌倒事件，通过解耦运动预测和步态分类任务实现高精度早期跌倒检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注跌倒检测，但跌倒发生前的预测以及稳定状态与即将跌倒之间的瞬态状态分析尚未得到充分探索，这对于辅助机器人系统至关重要。

Method: 使用混合模型：DGNN作为分类器区分稳定、瞬态和跌倒三种步态状态，LSTM网络预测后续时间步的人类运动。输入为从视频序列提取的实时骨骼特征。

Result: 在OUMVLP-Pose和URFD数据集上训练验证，相比仅使用DGNN的模型和文献中的模型，在预测误差和识别准确率方面表现出优越性能。

Conclusion: 解耦预测和分类任务相比统一处理能提升性能，该方法还能监测瞬态状态，为高级辅助系统功能增强提供有价值见解。

Abstract: Detecting and preventing falls in humans is a critical component of assistive
robotic systems. While significant progress has been made in detecting falls,
the prediction of falls before they happen, and analysis of the transient state
between stability and an impending fall remain unexplored. In this paper, we
propose a anticipatory fall detection method that utilizes a hybrid model
combining Dynamic Graph Neural Networks (DGNN) with Long Short-Term Memory
(LSTM) networks that decoupled the motion prediction and gait classification
tasks to anticipate falls with high accuracy. Our approach employs real-time
skeletal features extracted from video sequences as input for the proposed
model. The DGNN acts as a classifier, distinguishing between three gait states:
stable, transient, and fall. The LSTM-based network then predicts human
movement in subsequent time steps, enabling early detection of falls. The
proposed model was trained and validated using the OUMVLP-Pose and URFD
datasets, demonstrating superior performance in terms of prediction error and
recognition accuracy compared to models relying solely on DGNN and models from
literature. The results indicate that decoupling prediction and classification
improves performance compared to addressing the unified problem using only the
DGNN. Furthermore, our method allows for the monitoring of the transient state,
offering valuable insights that could enhance the functionality of advanced
assistance systems.

### [11] [RED: Robust Event-Guided Motion Deblurring with Modality-Specific Disentangled Representation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05554)
*Yihong Leng,Siming Zheng,Jinwei Chen,Bo Li,Jiaojiao Li,Peng-Tao Jiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 事件相机指导的动态去模糊网络RED，通过随机投影策略和解耦关注机制应对事件流不完整性问题，在合成和实际数据集上都达到了最高水平的准确性和稳健性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法忽视了事件流的本质不完整性问题，这是由于动态视觉传感器(DVS)的阈值机制在敏感性和噪声之间的批执所引起的。这种退化影响了运动先验知识的完整性，限制了事件指导去模糊的效果。

Method: 1）提出稳健性导向的批手策略(RPS)，通过对事件进行随机掩码来暴露网络于不完整模式，从而培养对各种未知场景条件的稳健性。 2）设计了解耦全尺度关注(OmniAttention)机制，显式地建模来自两种本质不同但互补的源（模糊图像和部分中断的事件）的内部运动、运动间和跨模态相关性。 3）基于可靠特征，设计了两个交互模块来增强模糊图像中的运动敏感区域并向不完整的事件表征注入语义上下文。

Result: 在合成和实际数据集上进行的大量实验表明，RED网络在准确性和稳健性方面都一贯地达到了最先进水平。

Conclusion: 该方法有效地解决了事件流不完整性对动态去模糊的挑战，通过稳健性导向的训练策略和跨模态特征解耦，显著提升了去模糊的效果。

Abstract: Event cameras provide sparse yet temporally high-temporal-resolution motion
information, demonstrating great potential for motion deblurring. Existing
methods focus on cross-modal interaction, overlooking the inherent
incompleteness of event streams, which arises from the trade-off between
sensitivity and noise introduced by the thresholding mechanism of Dynamic
Vision Sensors (DVS). Such degradation compromises the integrity of motion
priors and limits the effectiveness of event-guided deblurring. To tackle these
challenges, we propose a Robust Event-guided Deblurring (RED) network with
modality-specific disentangled representation. First, we introduce a
Robustness-Oriented Perturbation Strategy (RPS) that applies random masking to
events, which exposes RED to incomplete patterns and then foster robustness
against various unknown scenario conditions.Next, a disentangled OmniAttention
is presented to explicitly model intra-motion, inter-motion, and cross-modality
correlations from two inherently distinct but complementary sources: blurry
images and partially disrupted events. Building on these reliable features, two
interactive modules are designed to enhance motion-sensitive areas in blurry
images and inject semantic context into incomplete event representations.
Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate RED
consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance in both accuracy and
robustness.

TL;DR: 本文通过对比K-Means和FCM算法，分析了硬聚类与软聚类在脑部脱病分割中的性能特点，发现K-Means计算更快但准确性较低，FCM准确性更高但耗时更长。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 脑部脱病在MRI图像中的异质性和复杂形态使分割面临重大挑战，准确的脱病边界划分对临床诊断和治疗规划至关重要。

Method: 使用BraTS2020数据集，通过高斯滤波和CLAHE预处理，对比分析K-Means（硬聚类）和FCM（软聚类）两种聚类算法在脱病分割中的性能。

Result: K-Means平均运行时间0.3秒/张，Dice系数0.43；FCM平均运行时间1.3秒/张，Dice系数0.67。FCM分割准确性更高，但计算成本更大。

Conclusion: 硬聚类和软聚类在脑脱病分割中存在明显的计算效率与边界精度的交换关系，临床应用需根据具体需求选择适宜的算法。

Abstract: Segmentation of brain tumors from Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) remains a
pivotal challenge in medical image analysis due to the heterogeneous nature of
tumor morphology and intensity distributions. Accurate delineation of tumor
boundaries is critical for clinical decision-making, radiotherapy planning, and
longitudinal disease monitoring. In this study, we perform a comprehensive
comparative analysis of two major clustering paradigms applied in MRI tumor
segmentation: hard clustering, exemplified by the K-Means algorithm, and soft
clustering, represented by Fuzzy C-Means (FCM). While K-Means assigns each
pixel strictly to a single cluster, FCM introduces partial memberships, meaning
each pixel can belong to multiple clusters with varying degrees of association.
Experimental validation was performed using the BraTS2020 dataset,
incorporating pre-processing through Gaussian filtering and Contrast Limited
Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE). Evaluation metrics included the Dice
Similarity Coefficient (DSC) and processing time, which collectively
demonstrated that K-Means achieved superior speed with an average runtime of
0.3s per image, whereas FCM attained higher segmentation accuracy with an
average DSC of 0.67 compared to 0.43 for K-Means, albeit at a higher
computational cost (1.3s per image). These results highlight the inherent
trade-off between computational efficiency and boundary precision.

Abstract: Accurate classification of pests and diseases plays a vital role in precision
agriculture, enabling efficient identification, targeted interventions, and
preventing their further spread. However, current methods primarily focus on
binary classification, which limits their practical applications, especially in
scenarios where accurately identifying the specific type of disease or pest is
essential. We propose a robust deep learning based model for multi-class

Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model by integrating attention based modules
and employing comprehensive data augmentation pipeline to mitigate class
imbalance. We propose a model which gives 96.90% overall accuracy and 0.96 F1
score on real-world field image dataset. This model gives better results than
other approaches using the same datasets.

Method: 提出Delta Velocity Rectified Flow框架，显式建模源目标速度场差异，引入时间相关偏移项将噪声潜在向量推向目标轨迹。

Result: 实验结果表明DVRF在编辑质量、保真度和可控性方面表现优异，无需架构修改即可高效应用于文本到图像编辑任务。

Conclusion: DVRF成功连接了基于分数的扩散优化和基于速度的整流流优化，为FlowEdit等方法提供了理论解释，实现了高质量的无反演图像编辑。

Abstract: We propose Delta Velocity Rectified Flow (DVRF), a novel inversion-free,
path-aware editing framework within rectified flow models for text-to-image
editing. DVRF is a distillation-based method that explicitly models the
discrepancy between the source and target velocity fields in order to mitigate
over-smoothing artifacts rampant in prior distillation sampling approaches. We
further introduce a time-dependent shift term to push noisy latents closer to
the target trajectory, enhancing the alignment with the target distribution. We
theoretically demonstrate that when this shift is disabled, DVRF reduces to
Delta Denoising Score, thereby bridging score-based diffusion optimization and
velocity-based rectified-flow optimization. Moreover, when the shift term
follows a linear schedule under rectified-flow dynamics, DVRF generalizes the
Inversion-free method FlowEdit and provides a principled theoretical
interpretation for it. Experimental results indicate that DVRF achieves
superior editing quality, fidelity, and controllability while requiring no
architectural modifications, making it efficient and broadly applicable to
text-to-image editing tasks. Code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统卷积神经网络在医学图像分析中难以捕捉对准确诊断至关重要的细粒度复杂特征，需要增强模型对关键区域的关注能力

Abstract: Deep learning has become a powerful tool for medical image analysis; however,
conventional Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) often fail to capture the
fine-grained and complex features critical for accurate diagnosis. To address
this limitation, we systematically integrate attention mechanisms into five
widely adopted CNN architectures, namely, VGG16, ResNet18, InceptionV3,
DenseNet121, and EfficientNetB5, to enhance their ability to focus on salient
regions and improve discriminative performance. Specifically, each baseline
model is augmented with either a Squeeze and Excitation block or a hybrid
Convolutional Block Attention Module, allowing adaptive recalibration of
channel and spatial feature representations. The proposed models are evaluated
on two distinct medical imaging datasets, a brain tumor MRI dataset comprising
multiple tumor subtypes, and a Products of Conception histopathological dataset
containing four tissue categories. Experimental results demonstrate that
attention augmented CNNs consistently outperform baseline architectures across
all metrics. In particular, EfficientNetB5 with hybrid attention achieves the
highest overall performance, delivering substantial gains on both datasets.
Beyond improved classification accuracy, attention mechanisms enhance feature
localization, leading to better generalization across heterogeneous imaging
modalities. This work contributes a systematic comparative framework for
embedding attention modules in diverse CNN architectures and rigorously
assesses their impact across multiple medical imaging tasks. The findings
provide practical insights for the development of robust, interpretable, and
clinically applicable deep learning based decision support systems.

Abstract: Instance segmentation is essential for numerous computer vision applications,
including robotics, human-computer interaction, and autonomous driving.
Currently, popular models bring impressive performance in instance segmentation
by training with a large number of human annotations, which are costly to
collect. For this reason, we present a new framework that efficiently and
effectively segments objects without the need for human annotations. Firstly, a
MultiCut algorithm is applied to self-supervised features for coarse mask
segmentation. Then, a mask filter is employed to obtain high-quality coarse
masks. To train the segmentation network, we compute a novel superpixel-guided
mask loss, comprising hard loss and soft loss, with high-quality coarse masks
and superpixels segmented from low-level image features. Lastly, a
self-training process with a new adaptive loss is proposed to improve the
quality of predicted masks. We conduct experiments on public datasets in
instance segmentation and object detection to demonstrate the effectiveness of
the proposed framework. The results show that the proposed framework
outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Cell biomechanics involve a great number of complex phenomena that are
fundamental to the evolution of life itself and other associated processes,
ranging from the very early stages of embryo-genesis to the maintenance of
damaged structures or the growth of tumors. Given the importance of such
phenomena, increasing research has been dedicated to their understanding, but
the many interactions between them and their influence on the decisions of
cells as a collective network or cluster remain unclear. We present a new
approach that combines Structure Preserving Neural Networks, which study cell
movements as a purely mechanical system, with other Machine Learning tools
(Artificial Neural Networks), which allow taking into consideration
environmental factors that can be directly deduced from an experiment with
Computer Vision techniques. This new model, tested on simulated and real cell

Conclusion: 频率感知的优化对于实现真实图像表征至关重要。FA-VAE框架为现有潜在tokenizer存在的保真度问题提供了解决方案，对内容创作、神经渲染和医学成像等应用领域具有广泛意义。

Abstract: Latent generative models have shown remarkable progress in high-fidelity
image synthesis, typically using a two-stage training process that involves
compressing images into latent embeddings via learned tokenizers in the first
stage. The quality of generation strongly depends on how expressive and
well-optimized these latent embeddings are. While various methods have been
proposed to learn effective latent representations, the reconstructed images
often lack realism, particularly in textured regions with sharp transitions,
due to loss of fine details governed by high frequencies. We conduct a detailed
frequency decomposition of existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) latent tokenizers
and show that conventional objectives inherently prioritize low-frequency
reconstruction, often at the expense of high-frequency fidelity. Our analysis
reveals these latent tokenizers exhibit a bias toward low-frequency
information, when jointly optimized, leading to over-smoothed outputs and
visual artifacts that diminish perceptual quality. To address this, we propose
a wavelet-based, frequency-aware variational autoencoder (FA-VAE) framework
that explicitly decouples the optimization of low- and high-frequency
components. This decoupling enables improved reconstruction of fine textures
while preserving global structure. Our approach bridges the fidelity gap in
current latent tokenizers and emphasizes the importance of frequency-aware
optimization for realistic image representation, with broader implications for
applications in content creation, neural rendering, and medical imaging.

Motivation: 深度卷积神经网络在计算机视觉任务中表现出色，但其计算和内存开销限制了实际部署。需要一种高效的剪枝方法来减少模型复杂度，便于在边缘和移动平台上部署。

Abstract: Deep Convolutional Neural Networks have achieved state of the art performance
across various computer vision tasks, however their practical deployment is
limited by computational and memory overhead. This paper introduces
Differential Sensitivity Fusion Pruning, a novel single shot filter pruning
framework that focuses on evaluating the stability and redundancy of filter
importance scores across multiple criteria. Differential Sensitivity Fusion
Pruning computes a differential sensitivity score for each filter by fusing the
discrepancies among gradient based sensitivity, first order Taylor expansion,
and KL divergence of activation distributions. An exponential scaling mechanism
is applied to emphasize filters with inconsistent importance across metrics,
identifying candidates that are structurally unstable or less critical to the
model performance. Unlike iterative or reinforcement learning based pruning
strategies, Differential Sensitivity Fusion Pruning is efficient and
deterministic, requiring only a single forward-backward pass for scoring and
pruning. Extensive experiments across varying pruning rates between 50 to 70
percent demonstrate that Differential Sensitivity Fusion Pruning significantly
reduces model complexity, achieving over 80 percent Floating point Operations
Per Seconds reduction while maintaining high accuracy. For instance, at 70
percent pruning, our approach retains up to 98.23 percent of baseline accuracy,
surpassing traditional heuristics in both compression and generalization. The
proposed method presents an effective solution for scalable and adaptive Deep
Convolutional Neural Networks compression, paving the way for efficient
deployment on edge and mobile platforms.

Method: 系统研究YOLOv8和YOLOv10变体的多种冻结配置，使用4个关键基础设施监控数据集，集成梯度行为分析（L2范数）和可视化解释（Grad-CAM）来揭示训练动态

Result: 研究发现没有通用的最佳冻结策略，而是依赖于数据特性。冻结backbone有助于保留通用特征，浅层冻结更适合处理极端类别不平衡。这些配置能节省28%的GPU内存消耗，某些情况下甚至超越全量微调的mAP@50分数

Conclusion: 该研究提供了选择冻结策略的实证研究结果和实践指南，为资源受限场景下的物体检测转移学习提供了平衡的、基于证据的方法进距

Abstract: The You Only Look Once (YOLO) architecture is crucial for real-time object
detection. However, deploying it in resource-constrained environments such as
unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) requires efficient transfer learning. Although
layer freezing is a common technique, the specific impact of various freezing
configurations on contemporary YOLOv8 and YOLOv10 architectures remains
unexplored, particularly with regard to the interplay between freezing depth,
dataset characteristics, and training dynamics. This research addresses this
gap by presenting a detailed analysis of layer-freezing strategies. We
systematically investigate multiple freezing configurations across YOLOv8 and
YOLOv10 variants using four challenging datasets that represent critical
infrastructure monitoring. Our methodology integrates a gradient behavior
analysis (L2 norm) and visual explanations (Grad-CAM) to provide deeper
insights into training dynamics under different freezing strategies. Our
results reveal that there is no universal optimal freezing strategy but,
rather, one that depends on the properties of the data. For example, freezing
the backbone is effective for preserving general-purpose features, while a
shallower freeze is better suited to handling extreme class imbalance. These
configurations reduce graphics processing unit (GPU) memory consumption by up
to 28% compared to full fine-tuning and, in some cases, achieve mean average
precision (mAP@50) scores that surpass those of full fine-tuning. Gradient
analysis corroborates these findings, showing distinct convergence patterns for
moderately frozen models. Ultimately, this work provides empirical findings and
practical guidelines for selecting freezing strategies. It offers a practical,
evidence-based approach to balanced transfer learning for object detection in
scenarios with limited resources.

Conclusion: QUAN在保持旋转等变性的同时实现了高效计算，在资源受限的机器人系统中具有部署潜力，并适用于其他需要旋转感知的领域

Abstract: This paper introduces Quaternion Approximate Networks (QUAN), a novel deep
learning framework that leverages quaternion algebra for rotation equivariant
image classification and object detection. Unlike conventional quaternion
neural networks attempting to operate entirely in the quaternion domain, QUAN
approximates quaternion convolution through Hamilton product decomposition
using real-valued operations. This approach preserves geometric properties
while enabling efficient implementation with custom CUDA kernels. We introduce
Independent Quaternion Batch Normalization (IQBN) for training stability and
extend quaternion operations to spatial attention mechanisms. QUAN is evaluated
on image classification (CIFAR-10/100, ImageNet), object detection (COCO,
DOTA), and robotic perception tasks. In classification tasks, QUAN achieves
higher accuracy with fewer parameters and faster convergence compared to
existing convolution and quaternion-based models. For objection detection, QUAN
demonstrates improved parameter efficiency and rotation handling over standard
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) while establishing the SOTA for quaternion
CNNs in this downstream task. These results highlight its potential for
deployment in resource-constrained robotic systems requiring rotation-aware
perception and application in other domains.

Abstract: Recently, distilling open-vocabulary language features from 2D images into 3D
Gaussians has attracted significant attention. Although existing methods
achieve impressive language-based interactions of 3D scenes, we observe two
fundamental issues: background Gaussians contributing negligibly to a rendered
pixel get the same feature as the dominant foreground ones, and multi-view
inconsistencies due to view-specific noise in language embeddings. We introduce
Visibility-Aware Language Aggregation (VALA), a lightweight yet effective
method that computes marginal contributions for each ray and applies a
visibility-aware gate to retain only visible Gaussians. Moreover, we propose a
streaming weighted geometric median in cosine space to merge noisy multi-view
features. Our method yields a robust, view-consistent language feature
embedding in a fast and memory-efficient manner. VALA improves open-vocabulary
localization and segmentation across reference datasets, consistently
surpassing existing works.

Motivation: 现有表示学习方法主要针对动作识别任务，基于孤立序列表示，而动作分割需要利用多尺度表示和跨序列变化

Method: 提出Shuffle and Warp数据增强策略，引入Cross Permutation Contrasting (CPC)和Relative Order Reasoning (ROR)两个代理任务，构建Dual-Surrogate Contrastive Learning (DuoCLR)网络

Result: 在未修剪骨架数据集上评估，在多类和多标签动作分割任务中均显著优于现有最优方法

Conclusion: DuoCLR框架通过对比学习有效学习到适用于动作分割的多尺度特征表示，各组件均对性能提升有重要贡献

Abstract: In this paper, a contrastive representation learning framework is proposed to
enhance human action segmentation via pre-training using trimmed (single
action) skeleton sequences. Unlike previous representation learning works that
are tailored for action recognition and that build upon isolated sequence-wise
representations, the proposed framework focuses on exploiting multi-scale
representations in conjunction with cross-sequence variations. More
specifically, it proposes a novel data augmentation strategy, 'Shuffle and
Warp', which exploits diverse multi-action permutations. The latter effectively
assists two surrogate tasks that are introduced in contrastive learning: Cross
Permutation Contrasting (CPC) and Relative Order Reasoning (ROR). In
optimization, CPC learns intra-class similarities by contrasting
representations of the same action class across different permutations, while
ROR reasons about inter-class contexts by predicting relative mapping between
two permutations. Together, these tasks enable a Dual-Surrogate Contrastive
Learning (DuoCLR) network to learn multi-scale feature representations
optimized for action segmentation. In experiments, DuoCLR is pre-trained on a
trimmed skeleton dataset and evaluated on an untrimmed dataset where it
demonstrates a significant boost over state-the-art comparatives in both
multi-class and multi-label action segmentation tasks. Lastly, ablation studies
are conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of each component of the proposed
approach.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有PTQ方法迭代参数更新导致的计算复杂度高、资源开销大问题，限制了在边缘计算和实时推理场景中的应用

Method: 基于参数敏感性分析，优先量化高敏感性参数，利用未量化低敏感性参数补偿量化误差；通过列向聚类和行并行量化框架，采用全局共享逆Hessian矩阵更新机制

Result: 在ResNet-50和YOLOv5s上实现了20-200倍量化速度提升，平均准确性损失低于0.3%

Conclusion: 该方法有效圷衡了效率与准确性，适用于资源受限的边缘计算和实时推理场景

Abstract: Model quantization reduces neural network parameter precision to achieve
compression, but often compromises accuracy. Existing post-training
quantization (PTQ) methods employ iterative parameter updates to preserve
accuracy under high compression ratios, incurring significant computational
complexity and resource overhead, which limits applicability in
resource-constrained edge computing and real-time inference scenarios. This
paper proposes an efficient PTQ method guided by parameter sensitivity
analysis. The approach prioritizes quantization of high-sensitivity parameters,
leveraging unquantized low-sensitivity parameters to compensate for
quantization errors, thereby mitigating accuracy degradation. Furthermore, by
exploiting column-wise clustering of parameter sensitivity, the method
introduces a row-parallel quantization framework with a globally shared inverse
Hessian matrix update mechanism, reducing computational complexity by an order
of magnitude. Experimental results on ResNet-50 and YOLOv5s demonstrate a
20-200-fold quantization speedup over the Optimal Brain Quantization baseline,
with mean accuracy loss below 0.3%, confirming the method's efficacy in
balancing efficiency and accuracy.

Motivation: 解决使用单张照片生成高质量可控虚拟人头像的挑战，提升重建质量和驱动效率

Method: 采用重建与驱动分离框架，基于WebSSL的大规模一次性Gaussian头像生成器，使用两阶段训练策略提升泛化能力和高频细节重建

Result: 在512x512分辨率下达到90 FPS的高帧率渲染，驱动效率不受影响，重建模块参数扩大可提升性能，实验结果超越当前最先进方法

Conclusion: 该分离式框架能够高效地从单张图片生成高质量可控虚拟人，具有良好的扩展性和实时性能，为单图虚拟人生成提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: In this paper, we explore a reconstruction and reenactment separated
framework for 3D Gaussians head, which requires only a single portrait image as
input to generate controllable avatar. Specifically, we developed a large-scale
one-shot gaussian head generator built upon WebSSL and employed a two-stage
training approach that significantly enhances the capabilities of
generalization and high-frequency texture reconstruction. During inference, an
ultra-lightweight gaussian avatar driven by control signals enables high
frame-rate rendering, achieving 90 FPS at a resolution of 512x512. We further
demonstrate that the proposed framework follows the scaling law, whereby
increasing the parameter scale of the reconstruction module leads to improved
performance. Moreover, thanks to the separation design, driving efficiency
remains unaffected. Finally, extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments
validate that our approach outperforms current state-of-the-art methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了MFFI数据集，针对现有Deepfake检测数据集在真实场景多样性不足的问题，通过四个维度增强真实性：更广泛的伪造方法、多样的面部场景、多样化的真实数据、多级退化操作。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前Deepfake检测方法受限于现有数据集的多样性不足，无法应对真实世界的复杂场景，特别是在未知伪造技术、面部场景变化、真实数据丰富度和现实传播退化方面存在局限。

Method: 构建MFFI多维人脸伪造图像数据集，基于四个策略维度：1)包含50种不同伪造方法；2)多样化的面部场景；3)多样化的真实数据；4)多级退化操作，共包含1024K图像样本。

Conclusion: MFFI数据集通过多维度的真实性增强，为Deepfake检测提供了更接近真实场景的基准数据集，有助于提升检测模型在现实应用中的性能。

Abstract: Rapid advances in Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC) have
enabled increasingly sophisticated face forgeries, posing a significant threat
to social security. However, current Deepfake detection methods are limited by
constraints in existing datasets, which lack the diversity necessary in
real-world scenarios. Specifically, these data sets fall short in four key
areas: unknown of advanced forgery techniques, variability of facial scenes,
richness of real data, and degradation of real-world propagation. To address
these challenges, we propose the Multi-dimensional Face Forgery Image
(\textbf{MFFI}) dataset, tailored for real-world scenarios. MFFI enhances
realism based on four strategic dimensions: 1) Wider Forgery Methods; 2) Varied
Facial Scenes; 3) Diversified Authentic Data; 4) Multi-level Degradation
Operations. MFFI integrates $50$ different forgery methods and contains $1024K$
image samples. Benchmark evaluations show that MFFI outperforms existing public
datasets in terms of scene complexity, cross-domain generalization capability,
and detection difficulty gradients. These results validate the technical
advance and practical utility of MFFI in simulating real-world conditions. The
dataset and additional details are publicly available at

*Jungin Park,Jiyoung Lee,Kwanghoon Sohn*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VideoGraph提出了一种语言引导的时空图建模方法，通过递归时空图网络将对象和帧分别建模为空间和时间图节点，利用语言查询增强语义关系，实现了视频摘要的先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频摘要方法主要关注帧间的全局时序建模，但忽略了细粒度视觉实体（如对象）与视频主要内容的高度相关性。语言引导的视频摘要需要全面理解复杂真实世界视频的语义关系。

Method: 将视频摘要视为语言引导的时空图建模问题，构建空间图（对象节点）和时间图（帧节点），通过图边表示节点间的语义关系。引入语言查询增强节点表示的语义知识，采用递归策略优化初始图并正确分类关键帧。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，VideoGraph在有监督和无监督设置下均实现了通用和查询聚焦视频摘要的最先进性能。

Conclusion: 通过语言引导的时空图建模和递归优化策略，VideoGraph能够有效捕捉视频中的语义关系，显著提升了视频摘要的质量和准确性。

Abstract: Video summarization aims to select keyframes that are visually diverse and
can represent the whole story of a given video. Previous approaches have
focused on global interlinkability between frames in a video by temporal
modeling. However, fine-grained visual entities, such as objects, are also
highly related to the main content of the video. Moreover, language-guided
video summarization, which has recently been studied, requires a comprehensive
linguistic understanding of complex real-world videos. To consider how all the
objects are semantically related to each other, this paper regards video
summarization as a language-guided spatiotemporal graph modeling problem. We
present recursive spatiotemporal graph networks, called VideoGraph, which
formulate the objects and frames as nodes of the spatial and temporal graphs,
respectively. The nodes in each graph are connected and aggregated with graph
edges, representing the semantic relationships between the nodes. To prevent
the edges from being configured with visual similarity, we incorporate language
queries derived from the video into the graph node representations, enabling
them to contain semantic knowledge. In addition, we adopt a recursive strategy
to refine initial graphs and correctly classify each frame node as a keyframe.
In our experiments, VideoGraph achieves state-of-the-art performance on several
benchmarks for generic and query-focused video summarization in both supervised
and unsupervised manners. The code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Patch-level Kernel Alignment (PaKA)方法，通过自监督学习将预训练语义知识迁移到密集特征空间，在密集视觉任务上达到SOTA性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的自监督表示学习方法主要关注全局表示，难以捕捉密集预测任务所需的局部语义信息，需要将语义知识转移到密集特征空间

Method: 提出PaKA对齐目标，通过匹配教师和学生模型密集补丁的统计依赖关系来对齐特征分布，并研究专门针对密集表示学习的增强策略

Result: 在多个密集视觉基准测试中取得了最先进的结果

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了密集表示学习中的语义知识迁移问题，PaKA目标简单而有效

Abstract: Dense representations are essential for vision tasks that require spatial
precision and fine-grained detail. While most self-supervised representation
learning methods focus on global representations that summarize the image as a
whole, such approaches often fall short in capturing the localized semantics
necessary for dense prediction tasks. To overcome these limitations, we propose
a framework that builds on pretrained representations through additional
self-supervised learning, aiming to transfer existing semantic knowledge into
the dense feature space. Our method aligns the distributions of dense features
between a teacher and a student model. Specifically, we introduce Patch-level
Kernel Alignment (PaKA), a simple yet effective alignment objective that
captures statistical dependencies, thereby matching the structural
relationships of dense patches across the two models. In addition, we
investigate augmentation strategies specifically designed for dense
representation learning. Our framework achieves state-of-the-art results across
a variety of dense vision benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of our
approach.

*Hanzhen Wang,Jiaming Xu,Jiayi Pan,Yongkang Zhou,Guohao Dai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SpecPrune-VLA是一种无需训练的双层剪枝方法，利用局部和全局信息进行智能token选择，在VLA模型中实现显著加速且性能损失可忽略


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VLA模型剪枝方法仅使用当前动作的局部信息，忽略了历史动作的全局上下文，导致成功率下降超过20%且加速效果有限。研究发现连续动作间存在高度相似性，可以利用全局历史信息进行更智能的token剪枝

Method: 提出SpecPrune-VLA方法：1）动作级静态剪枝：结合全局历史和局部上下文减少每个动作的视觉token；2）层级动态剪枝：基于层级重要性逐层剪枝token；3）轻量级动作感知控制器：根据动作粒度（粗/细）调整剪枝强度，细粒度动作对剪枝更敏感

Result: 在LIBERO基准测试中，SpecPrune-VLA相比OpenVLA-OFT在NVIDIA A800上实现1.46倍加速，在NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090上实现1.57倍加速，成功率损失可忽略不计

Conclusion: 结合局部和全局信息的双层剪枝策略能有效提升VLA模型的推理速度，同时保持性能，为计算密集型模型的加速提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Pruning accelerates compute-bound models by reducing computation. Recently
applied to Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, existing methods prune tokens
using only local info from current action, ignoring global context from prior
actions, causing >20% success rate drop and limited speedup. We observe high
similarity across consecutive actions and propose leveraging both local
(current) and global (past) info for smarter token selection. We introduce
SpecPrune-VLA, a training-free method with two-level pruning and heuristic
control: (1) Static pruning at action level: uses global history and local
context to reduce visual tokens per action; (2) Dynamic pruning at layer level:
prunes tokens per layer based on layer-specific importance; (3) Lightweight
action-aware controller: classifies actions as coarse/fine-grained (by speed),
adjusting pruning aggressiveness since fine-grained actions are
pruning-sensitive. Experiments on LIBERO show SpecPrune-VLA achieves 1.46 times
speedup on NVIDIA A800 and 1.57 times on NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 vs.
OpenVLA-OFT, with negligible success rate loss.

*Kien Nguyen,Anh Tran,Cuong Pham*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SuMa是一种新的概念擦除方法，专门针对窄概念（如版权角色、名人）的擦除，通过子空间映射技术同时实现鲁棒性和有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有概念擦除方法无法同时处理鲁棒性和有效性，特别是对于窄概念（版权内容、名人）的擦除存在挑战，需要更精细的操作来解决版权和法律问题。

Method: SuMa首先推导出表示待擦除概念的目标子空间，然后通过将其映射到最小化距离的参考子空间来实现概念中和，确保目标概念被鲁棒擦除的同时保持图像质量。

Result: 在四个任务（子类擦除、名人擦除、艺术风格擦除、实例擦除）上的广泛实验表明，SuMa在图像质量上与专注于有效性的方法相当，同时在完整性方面与专门方法结果相当。

Conclusion: SuMa方法成功解决了窄概念擦除的挑战，实现了鲁棒性和有效性的平衡，为处理版权和法律问题提供了有效的技术解决方案。

Abstract: The rapid growth of text-to-image diffusion models has raised concerns about
their potential misuse in generating harmful or unauthorized contents. To
address these issues, several Concept Erasure methods have been proposed.
However, most of them fail to achieve both robustness, i.e., the ability to
robustly remove the target concept., and effectiveness, i.e., maintaining image
quality. While few recent techniques successfully achieve these goals for NSFW
concepts, none could handle narrow concepts such as copyrighted characters or
celebrities. Erasing these narrow concepts is critical in addressing copyright
and legal concerns. However, erasing them is challenging due to their close
distances to non-target neighboring concepts, requiring finer-grained
manipulation. In this paper, we introduce Subspace Mapping (SuMa), a novel
method specifically designed to achieve both robustness and effectiveness in
easing these narrow concepts. SuMa first derives a target subspace representing
the concept to be erased and then neutralizes it by mapping it to a reference
subspace that minimizes the distance between the two. This mapping ensures the
target concept is robustly erased while preserving image quality. We conduct
extensive experiments with SuMa across four tasks: subclass erasure, celebrity
erasure, artistic style erasure, and instance erasure and compare the results
with current state-of-the-art methods. Our method achieves image quality
comparable to approaches focused on effectiveness, while also yielding results
that are on par with methods targeting completeness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 航空遥感中的多光谱和RGB成像技术推动了精准农业的发展，但高光谱图像标签有限或无标签的情况下的分析具有挑战性。需要开发能够有效提取植被特性的表示学习方法。

Method: 采用自监督学习方法来构建神经网络嵌入空间，该空间能够反映树木的植被特性，从航空高光谱图像中学习有意义的表示。

Result: 实验结果表明，使用植被特性相关的嵌入空间构建的树木表示，在下游机器学习任务中的性能优于直接使用高光谱植被特性作为树木表示的方法。

Conclusion: 自监督学习方法能够有效从高光谱图像中学习到反映植被特性的嵌入表示，这种表示在下游任务中具有更好的性能，为精准农业中的高光谱图像分析提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Aerial remote sensing using multispectral and RGB imagers has provided a
critical impetus to precision agriculture. Analysis of the hyperspectral images
with limited or no labels is challenging. This paper focuses on self-supervised
learning to create neural network embeddings reflecting vegetation properties
of trees from aerial hyperspectral images of crop fields. Experimental results
demonstrate that a constructed tree representation, using a vegetation
property-related embedding space, performs better in downstream machine
learning tasks compared to the direct use of hyperspectral vegetation
properties as tree representations.

Motivation: 解决基于非孜加拉数据集训练的车辆检测系统在孜加拉特有道路环境中识别本地车辆类型准确性低的问题，为发展地区的自动驾驶技术提供适配解决方案。

Method: 使用6种YOLO模型变体在包含29种孜加拉特有车辆类别的自定义数据集上进行评估，数据集包含高清图片和手动标注的YOLO格式边框。

Result: YOLOv11x表现最好（mAP@0.5为63.7%），但速度慢（每张图片45.8毫秒）。中等模型性能与速度平衡。罀有车辆类别（如建筑车辆和Desi Nosimons）检测准确性很低，视觉相似车辆容易歧识别。

Conclusion: 研究为孜加拉道路环境特定的强壁物体检测系统建立了基础，解决了通用模型在发展地区效果不佳的问题，推动了自动驾驶技术在发展中国家的发展。

Abstract: Vehicle detection systems trained on Non-Bangladeshi datasets struggle to
accurately identify local vehicle types in Bangladesh's unique road
environments, creating critical gaps in autonomous driving technology for
developing regions. This study evaluates six YOLO model variants on a custom
dataset featuring 29 distinct vehicle classes, including region-specific
vehicles such as ``Desi Nosimon'', ``Leguna'', ``Battery Rickshaw'', and
``CNG''. The dataset comprises high-resolution images (1920x1080) captured
across various Bangladeshi roads using mobile phone cameras and manually
annotated using LabelImg with YOLO format bounding boxes. Performance
evaluation revealed YOLOv11x as the top performer, achieving 63.7\% mAP@0.5,
43.8\% mAP@0.5:0.95, 61.4\% recall, and 61.6\% F1-score, though requiring 45.8
milliseconds per image for inference. Medium variants (YOLOv8m, YOLOv11m)
struck an optimal balance, delivering robust detection performance with mAP@0.5
values of 62.5\% and 61.8\% respectively, while maintaining moderate inference
times around 14-15 milliseconds. The study identified significant detection
challenges for rare vehicle classes, with Construction Vehicles and Desi
Nosimons showing near-zero accuracy due to dataset imbalances and insufficient
training samples. Confusion matrices revealed frequent misclassifications
between visually similar vehicles, particularly Mini Trucks versus Mini Covered
Vans. This research provides a foundation for developing robust object
detection systems specifically adapted to Bangladesh traffic conditions,
addressing critical needs in autonomous vehicle technology advancement for
developing regions where conventional generic-trained models fail to perform
adequately.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EditIDv2是一个无需调优的解决方案，专门针对高复杂度叙事场景和长文本输入，通过改进ID特征整合模块和感知器注意力分解，实现在少量数据下保持身份一致性的深度语义编辑。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有角色编辑方法在简单提示下表现良好，但在面对包含多层语义、时间逻辑和复杂上下文关系的长文本叙事时，会出现编辑能力下降、语义理解偏差和身份一致性崩溃的问题。

Method: 通过感知器注意力的精细分解、引入ID损失和与扩散模型的联合动态训练，以及集成模块的离线融合策略，在少量数据润滑下实现深度多级语义编辑。

Result: 在复杂叙事环境中保持身份一致性的同时实现深度语义编辑，满足长提示和高质量图像生成的需求，在IBench评估中取得优异结果。

Conclusion: EditIDv2成功解决了长文本叙事场景下的角色编辑挑战，通过创新的架构设计和训练策略，在保持身份一致性的前提下实现了高质量的复杂语义编辑。

Abstract: We propose EditIDv2, a tuning-free solution specifically designed for
high-complexity narrative scenes and long text inputs. Existing character
editing methods perform well under simple prompts, but often suffer from
degraded editing capabilities, semantic understanding biases, and identity
consistency breakdowns when faced with long text narratives containing multiple
semantic layers, temporal logic, and complex contextual relationships. In
EditID, we analyzed the impact of the ID integration module on editability. In
EditIDv2, we further explore and address the influence of the ID feature
integration module. The core of EditIDv2 is to discuss the issue of editability
injection under minimal data lubrication. Through a sophisticated decomposition
of PerceiverAttention, the introduction of ID loss and joint dynamic training
with the diffusion model, as well as an offline fusion strategy for the
integration module, we achieve deep, multi-level semantic editing while
maintaining identity consistency in complex narrative environments using only a
small amount of data lubrication. This meets the demands of long prompts and
high-quality image generation, and achieves excellent results in the IBench
evaluation.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于语言模型的场景图预测方法OOTSM，通过两阶段LLM处理实现对象状态预测和关系生成，在短期和长期预测上均取得显著性能提升


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有场景图预测方法主要依赖视觉线索，难以有效整合常识知识，限制了长期预测的鲁棒性。需要显式利用常识知识来更好理解场景中的对象、概念和关系

Method: 提出语言场景图预测(LSGA)方法，采用面向对象的两阶段方法(OOTSM)：首先用LLM预测对象出现和消失，然后生成详细的人-物关系。将场景图预测任务解耦为场景图提取和纯文本预测两个步骤

Result: 在Action Genome基准测试中，短期mean-Recall(@10)提升3.4%，长期mean-Recall(@50)大幅提升21.9%，达到最先进性能

Conclusion: 语言模型在场景图预测任务中表现出色，OOTSM方法有效整合了常识知识，显著提升了特别是长期预测的性能，为智能监控和人机协作应用提供了有力工具

Abstract: A scene graph is a structured represention of objects and their relationships
in a scene. Scene Graph Anticipation (SGA) involves predicting future scene
graphs from video clips, enabling applications as intelligent surveillance and
human-machine collaboration. Existing SGA approaches primarily leverage visual
cues, often struggling to integrate valuable commonsense knowledge, thereby
limiting long-term prediction robustness. To explicitly leverage such
commonsense knowledge, we propose a new approach to better understand the
objects, concepts, and relationships in a scene graph. Our approach decouples
the SGA task in two steps: first a scene graph capturing model is used to
convert a video clip into a sequence of scene graphs, then a pure text-based
model is used to predict scene graphs in future frames. Our focus in this work
is on the second step, and we call it Linguistic Scene Graph Anticipation
(LSGA) and believes it should have independent interest beyond the use in SGA
discussed here. For LSGA, we introduce an Object-Oriented Two-Staged Method
(OOTSM) where an Large Language Model (LLM) first forecasts object appearances
and disappearances before generating detailed human-object relations. We
conduct extensive experiments to evaluate OOTSM in two settings. For LSGA, we
evaluate our fine-tuned open-sourced LLMs against zero-shot APIs (i.e., GPT-4o,
GPT-4o-mini, and DeepSeek-V3) on a benchmark constructed from Action Genome
annotations. For SGA, we combine our OOTSM with STTran++ from, and our
experiments demonstrate effective state-of-the-art performance: short-term
mean-Recall (@10) increases by 3.4% while long-term mean-Recall (@50) improves
dramatically by 21.9%. Code is available at https://github.com/ZhuXMMM/OOTSM.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受高能物理中堆积干扰减少策略的启发，想要将物理导向的前知来应用于图像去噪任务，提高模型在强噪声污染下的稳健性

Method: 提出了一系列受PU启发的去噪器：包括带守恒约束的殊差CNN、其高斯噪声变体，以及集成这些思想的WIPUNet（基于UNet的结构）

Result: 在CIFAR-10和BSD500数据集上，PU启发的CNN与标准基线相当，而WIPUNet在高噪声水平下显示出越来越大的优势，说明物理启发的前知提供了更好的稳健性

Conclusion: 物理受启发的前知可以作为模块化的徒移学习偏置嵌入神经网络结构，在不依赖重量级SOTA机制的情况下仍能在高噪声条件下带来稳健性提升

Abstract: In high-energy particle physics, collider measurements are contaminated by
"pileup", overlapping soft interactions that obscure the hard-scatter signal of
interest. Dedicated subtraction strategies exploit physical priors such as
conservation, locality, and isolation. Inspired by this analogy, we investigate
how such principles can inform image denoising by embedding physics-guided
inductive biases into neural architectures. This paper is a proof of concept:
rather than targeting state-of-the-art (SOTA) benchmarks, we ask whether
physics-inspired priors improve robustness under strong corruption.
  We introduce a hierarchy of PU-inspired denoisers: a residual CNN with
conservation constraints, its Gaussian-noise variants, and the Weighted
Inductive Pileup-physics-inspired U-Network for Denoising (WIPUNet), which
integrates these ideas into a UNet backbone. On CIFAR-10 with Gaussian noise at
$\sigma\in\{15,25,50,75,100\}$, PU-inspired CNNs are competitive with standard
baselines, while WIPUNet shows a \emph{widening margin} at higher noise.
Complementary BSD500 experiments show the same trend, suggesting
physics-inspired priors provide stability where purely data-driven models
degrade. Our contributions are: (i) translating pileup-mitigation principles
into modular inductive biases; (ii) integrating them into UNet; and (iii)
demonstrating robustness gains at high noise without relying on heavy SOTA
machinery.

TL;DR: CAMVR框架通过视觉-文本上下文记忆单元和自适应视觉聚焦机制，解决了多轮视觉对话中的上下文丢失和幻觉问题，在多个数据集上达到SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型和视觉语言大模型在单轮任务表现优秀，但在需要深度上下文理解和复杂视觉推理的多轮交互中存在推理碎片化、上下文丢失和幻觉等挑战。

Method: 提出CAMVR框架，包含两个关键创新：1) 视觉-文本上下文记忆单元(VCMU) - 动态读写记忆网络，存储管理每轮交互的关键视觉特征、文本语义表示及其跨模态对应关系；2) 自适应视觉聚焦指导(AVFG)机制 - 利用VCMU上下文动态调整视觉编码器对上下文相关图像区域的注意力。采用多级推理集成策略确保响应生成与当前输入和历史上下文深度一致。

Result: 在VisDial、适配的A-OKVQA和新型多轮指令跟随(MTIF)数据集上的广泛实验表明，CAMVR始终实现最先进的性能。

Conclusion: CAMVR框架有效提升了多轮视觉-文本推理能力，解决了现有模型在多轮交互中的关键限制，为复杂视觉对话任务提供了强有力的解决方案。

Abstract: Current Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision-Language Large Models (LVLMs)
excel in single-turn tasks but face significant challenges in multi-turn
interactions requiring deep contextual understanding and complex visual
reasoning, often leading to fragmented reasoning, context loss, and
hallucinations. To address these limitations, we propose Context-Aware
Multi-Turn Visual Reasoning (CAMVR), a novel framework designed to empower
LVLMs with robust and coherent multi-turn visual-textual inference
capabilities. CAMVR introduces two key innovations: a Visual-Textual Context
Memory Unit (VCMU), a dynamic read-write memory network that stores and manages
critical visual features, textual semantic representations, and their
cross-modal correspondences from each interaction turn; and an Adaptive Visual
Focus Guidance (AVFG) mechanism, which leverages the VCMU's context to
dynamically adjust the visual encoder's attention to contextually relevant
image regions. Our multi-level reasoning integration strategy ensures that
response generation is deeply coherent with both current inputs and accumulated
historical context. Extensive experiments on challenging datasets, including
VisDial, an adapted A-OKVQA, and our novel Multi-Turn Instruction Following
(MTIF) dataset, demonstrate that CAMVR consistently achieves state-of-the-art
performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图像分割研究存在可重复性危机，性能评估中指标实现不可靠是一个主要因素。基于距离的指标实现陷阱会导致不同开源工具间的显著差异。

Method: 开发了MeshMetrics框架，采用基于网格的方法而非传统的基于网格方法，通过理论分析和实证验证来精确计算距离指标。

Result: MeshMetrics比现有工具具有更高的准确性和精度，受距离量化等离散化伪影的影响显著减小，例如Hausdorff距离差异超过100mm。

Conclusion: MeshMetrics提供了一个更可靠的基于距离的分割指标计算框架，已作为开源Python包发布，有助于提高分割研究的可重复性。

Abstract: The surge of research in image segmentation has yielded remarkable
performance gains but also exposed a reproducibility crisis. A major
contributor is performance evaluation, where both selection and implementation
of metrics play critical roles. While recent efforts have improved the former,
the reliability of metric implementation has received far less attention.
Pitfalls in distance-based metric implementation can lead to considerable
discrepancies between common open-source tools, for instance, exceeding 100 mm
for the Hausdorff distance and 30%pt for the normalized surface distance for
the same pair of segmentations. To address these pitfalls, we introduce
MeshMetrics, a mesh-based framework that provides a more precise computation of
distance-based metrics than conventional grid-based approaches. Through
theoretical analysis and empirical validation, we demonstrate that MeshMetrics
achieves higher accuracy and precision than established tools, and is
substantially less affected by discretization artifacts, such as distance
quantization. We release MeshMetrics as an open-source Python package,
available at https://github.com/gasperpodobnik/MeshMetrics.

*Jingwei Peng,Zhixuan Qiu,Boyu Jin,Surasakdi Siripong*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LVLM-VAR是一个基于预训练视觉语言大模型的新型视频动作识别框架，通过视频到语义标记转换和LoRA微调，在NTU RGB+D等基准上实现了最先进性能并提升了模型可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法在深度语义理解、复杂上下文信息和细粒度区分方面存在局限，无法有效处理多样化视频数据。受大语言模型强大能力启发，希望利用视觉语言大模型提升视频动作识别的准确性和可解释性。

Method: 提出Video-to-Semantic-Tokens模块将原始视频序列转换为离散的语义动作标记，构建可被LVLM理解的"动作叙事"。结合自然语言指令，使用LoRA微调的LVLM（如LLaVA-13B）进行动作分类和语义推理。

Result: 在NTU RGB+D和NTU RGB+D 120等挑战性基准上达到最先进或极具竞争力的性能：NTU RGB+D X-Sub达到94.1%，NTU RGB+D 120 X-Set达到90.0%，显著提升模型可解释性，能生成自然语言解释。

Conclusion: LVLM-VAR成功将预训练视觉语言大模型应用于视频动作识别，不仅实现了优异的性能表现，还通过生成自然语言解释大幅提升了模型的可解释性，为视频理解任务提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Human action recognition often struggles with deep semantic understanding,
complex contextual information, and fine-grained distinction, limitations that
traditional methods frequently encounter when dealing with diverse video data.
Inspired by the remarkable capabilities of large language models, this paper
introduces LVLM-VAR, a novel framework that pioneers the application of
pre-trained Vision-Language Large Models (LVLMs) to video action recognition,
emphasizing enhanced accuracy and interpretability. Our method features a
Video-to-Semantic-Tokens (VST) Module, which innovatively transforms raw video
sequences into discrete, semantically and temporally consistent "semantic
action tokens," effectively crafting an "action narrative" that is
comprehensible to an LVLM. These tokens, combined with natural language
instructions, are then processed by a LoRA-fine-tuned LVLM (e.g., LLaVA-13B)
for robust action classification and semantic reasoning. LVLM-VAR not only
achieves state-of-the-art or highly competitive performance on challenging
benchmarks such as NTU RGB+D and NTU RGB+D 120, demonstrating significant
improvements (e.g., 94.1% on NTU RGB+D X-Sub and 90.0% on NTU RGB+D 120 X-Set),
but also substantially boosts model interpretability by generating natural
language explanations for its predictions.

TL;DR: 提出JRN-Geo网络，通过融合RGB和法线图像的几何结构信息，解决无人机跨视角地理定位中视角差异大的挑战


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要依赖RGB图像的语义特征，忽略了空间结构信息在捕获视角不变特征中的重要性

Method: 使用双分支特征提取框架，结合差异感知融合模块(DAFM)和联合约束交互聚合(JCIA)策略，并采用3D地理增强技术生成视角变化样本

Result: 在University-1652和SUES-200数据集上验证了方法的鲁棒性，实现了最先进的性能

Conclusion: 融合几何结构信息能有效提升跨视角地理定位的性能，特别是在复杂视角变化下的表现

Abstract: Cross-view geo-localization plays a critical role in Unmanned Aerial Vehicle
(UAV) localization and navigation. However, significant challenges arise from
the drastic viewpoint differences and appearance variations between images.
Existing methods predominantly rely on semantic features from RGB images, often
neglecting the importance of spatial structural information in capturing
viewpoint-invariant features. To address this issue, we incorporate geometric
structural information from normal images and introduce a Joint perception
network to integrate RGB and Normal images (JRN-Geo). Our approach utilizes a
dual-branch feature extraction framework, leveraging a Difference-Aware Fusion
Module (DAFM) and Joint-Constrained Interaction Aggregation (JCIA) strategy to
enable deep fusion and joint-constrained semantic and structural information
representation. Furthermore, we propose a 3D geographic augmentation technique
to generate potential viewpoint variation samples, enhancing the network's
ability to learn viewpoint-invariant features. Extensive experiments on the
University-1652 and SUES-200 datasets validate the robustness of our method
against complex viewpoint ariations, achieving state-of-the-art performance.

TL;DR: LiDAR-BIND-T扩展了多模态融合框架，通过时间一致性机制提升雷达/声纳到LiDAR转换的时空连贯性，显著改善SLAM性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多传感器融合中时间不一致性问题，提升下游SLAM任务的鲁棒性和性能。

Method: 引入三种时间一致性机制：时间嵌入相似性对齐、运动对齐变换损失匹配位移、窗口时间融合模块，并更新模型架构以保持空间结构。

Result: 在雷达/声纳到LiDAR转换中表现出更好的时空连贯性，降低了绝对轨迹误差，提高了Cartographer SLAM中的占据地图精度。

Conclusion: LiDAR-BIND-T保持了即插即用的多模态融合特性，同时显著增强了时间稳定性，为下游SLAM应用提供了更鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: This paper extends LiDAR-BIND, a modular multi-modal fusion framework that
binds heterogeneous sensors (radar, sonar) to a LiDAR-defined latent space,
with mechanisms that explicitly enforce temporal consistency. We introduce
three contributions: (i) temporal embedding similarity that aligns consecutive
latents, (ii) a motion-aligned transformation loss that matches displacement
between predictions and ground truth LiDAR, and (iii) windows temporal fusion
using a specialised temporal module. We further update the model architecture
to better preserve spatial structure. Evaluations on radar/sonar-to-LiDAR
translation demonstrate improved temporal and spatial coherence, yielding lower
absolute trajectory error and better occupancy map accuracy in
Cartographer-based SLAM (Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping). We propose
different metrics based on the Fr\'echet Video Motion Distance (FVMD) and a
correlation-peak distance metric providing practical temporal quality
indicators to evaluate SLAM performance. The proposed temporal LiDAR-BIND, or
LiDAR-BIND-T, maintains plug-and-play modality fusion while substantially
enhancing temporal stability, resulting in improved robustness and performance
for downstream SLAM.

Motivation: 为了解决多相机系统中视觉信息融合效率低、一致性差的问题，需要开发能够统一处理多相机观测并简化系统设计的框架

Method: 引入全景视觉特征模型统一多相机观测，提出外参补偿方法解决帧间不对齐问题，基于因子图实现紧耦合的LiDAR-视觉-惯性系统集成

Result: 在公开数据集上的实验表明，全景视觉特征模型提高了多相机约束的质量和一致性，相比现有系统具有更高的精度和鲁棒性

Conclusion: Multi-LVI-SAM框架通过全景建模和外参补偿有效解决了多相机系统的融合问题，为高精度状态估计提供了可靠解决方案

Abstract: We propose a multi-camera LiDAR-visual-inertial odometry framework,
Multi-LVI-SAM, which fuses data from multiple fisheye cameras, LiDAR and
inertial sensors for highly accurate and robust state estimation. To enable
efficient and consistent integration of visual information from multiple
fisheye cameras, we introduce a panoramic visual feature model that unifies
multi-camera observations into a single representation. The panoramic model
serves as a global geometric optimization framework that consolidates
multi-view constraints, enabling seamless loop closure and global pose
optimization, while simplifying system design by avoiding redundant handling of
individual cameras. To address the triangulation inconsistency caused by the
misalignment between each camera's frame and the panoramic model's frame, we
propose an extrinsic compensation method. This method improves feature
consistency across views and significantly reduces triangulation and
optimization errors, leading to more accurate pose estimation. We integrate the
panoramic visual feature model into a tightly coupled LiDAR-visual-inertial
system based on a factor graph. Extensive experiments on public datasets
demonstrate that the panoramic visual feature model enhances the quality and
consistency of multi-camera constraints, resulting in higher accuracy and
robustness than existing multi-camera LiDAR-visual-inertial systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这是一个基于变分框架的距离自适应单图超分辨方法，通过深度条件卷积核和学习的距离适应正则化项来处理实际影像系统中的空间变化降级效应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统单图超分辨假设空间不变的降级模型，但真实影像系统存在大气散射、景深变化和透视扭曲等距离依赖效应，需要空间自适应的重建策略。

Method: 提出变分框架，将降级运算符形式化为伪微分运算符，通过深度条件卷积核实现离散梯度流动力学，包含学习的距离适应正则化项和滤波生成网络。

Result: 在5个标准数据集上达到最高水平，在KITTI外景场景中2倍和4倍超分辨上分别获得36.89/0.9516和30.54/0.8721的PSNR/SSIM指标，超过现有方法0.44dB和0.36dB。

Conclusion: 这是第一个理论基础坚实的距离自适应超分辨框架，在深度变化场景中显著改善了性能，同时在传统标准上保持竞争力。

Abstract: Single image super-resolution traditionally assumes spatially-invariant
degradation models, yet real-world imaging systems exhibit complex
distance-dependent effects including atmospheric scattering, depth-of-field
variations, and perspective distortions. This fundamental limitation
necessitates spatially-adaptive reconstruction strategies that explicitly
incorporate geometric scene understanding for optimal performance. We propose a
rigorous variational framework that characterizes super-resolution as a
spatially-varying inverse problem, formulating the degradation operator as a
pseudodifferential operator with distance-dependent spectral characteristics
that enable theoretical analysis of reconstruction limits across depth ranges.
Our neural architecture implements discrete gradient flow dynamics through
cascaded residual blocks with depth-conditional convolution kernels, ensuring
convergence to stationary points of the theoretical energy functional while
incorporating learned distance-adaptive regularization terms that dynamically
adjust smoothness constraints based on local geometric structure. Spectral
constraints derived from atmospheric scattering theory prevent bandwidth
violations and noise amplification in far-field regions, while adaptive kernel
generation networks learn continuous mappings from depth to reconstruction
filters. Comprehensive evaluation across five benchmark datasets demonstrates
state-of-the-art performance, achieving 36.89/0.9516 and 30.54/0.8721 PSNR/SSIM
at 2 and 4 scales on KITTI outdoor scenes, outperforming existing methods by
0.44dB and 0.36dB respectively. This work establishes the first
theoretically-grounded distance-adaptive super-resolution framework and
demonstrates significant improvements on depth-variant scenarios while
maintaining competitive performance across traditional benchmarks.

TL;DR: 提出了InterAct数据集和基于扩散的方法，用于从语音输入同时生成两个人的交互式面部表情和身体动作，解决了长期动态交互行为捕捉的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究大多只关注单人或对话手势，假设身体朝向和位置不变，无法处理现实世界中目标驱动、动态且语义一致的长时间交互行为。

Method: 采集了包含241个运动序列的多模态数据集InterAct，并提出分层回归身体动作的扩散方法，以及改进嘴唇准确性的微调机制。

Result: 构建了包含多样化复杂动作和长期交互模式的数据集，提出的方法能够从语音有效估计两个人的交互式面部表情和身体动作。

Conclusion: InterAct数据集填补了长期动态交互行为数据的空白，提出的扩散方法为双人交互行为生成提供了有效解决方案，推动了该领域研究发展。

Abstract: We address the problem of accurate capture of interactive behaviors between
two people in daily scenarios. Most previous works either only consider one
person or solely focus on conversational gestures of two people, assuming the
body orientation and/or position of each actor are constant or barely change
over each interaction. In contrast, we propose to simultaneously model two
people's activities, and target objective-driven, dynamic, and semantically
consistent interactions which often span longer duration and cover bigger
space. To this end, we capture a new multi-modal dataset dubbed InterAct, which
is composed of 241 motion sequences where two people perform a realistic and
coherent scenario for one minute or longer over a complete interaction. For
each sequence, two actors are assigned different roles and emotion labels, and
collaborate to finish one task or conduct a common interaction activity. The
audios, body motions, and facial expressions of both persons are captured.
InterAct contains diverse and complex motions of individuals and interesting
and relatively long-term interaction patterns barely seen before. We also
demonstrate a simple yet effective diffusion-based method that estimates
interactive face expressions and body motions of two people from speech inputs.
Our method regresses the body motions in a hierarchical manner, and we also
propose a novel fine-tuning mechanism to improve the lip accuracy of facial
expressions. To facilitate further research, the data and code is made
available at https://hku-cg.github.io/interact/ .

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法在处理复杂组合描述时存在困难，主要挑战在于静态文本与动态视觉内容的对齐，特别是当对象具有相似外观但运动姿态不一致时。

Method: 1) 将自然语言查询解析为结构化语义命令；2) 时空定位模块生成所有候选轨迹；3) 分层识别模块通过粗粒度运动推理和细粒度姿态验证两阶段选择正确目标。

Result: 在Ref-YouTube-VOS、Ref-DAVIS17和MeViS三个主要基准测试中达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: PARSE-VOS框架通过分层推理和LLM驱动的方法，有效解决了视频对象分割中的语言-视觉对齐挑战，无需训练即可实现优异性能。

Abstract: Referring Video Object Segmentation (RVOS) aims to segment an object of
interest throughout a video based on a language description. The prominent
challenge lies in aligning static text with dynamic visual content,
particularly when objects exhibiting similar appearances with inconsistent
motion and poses. However, current methods often rely on a holistic
visual-language fusion that struggles with complex, compositional descriptions.
In this paper, we propose \textbf{PARSE-VOS}, a novel, training-free framework
powered by Large Language Models (LLMs), for a hierarchical, coarse-to-fine
reasoning across text and video domains. Our approach begins by parsing the
natural language query into structured semantic commands. Next, we introduce a
spatio-temporal grounding module that generates all candidate trajectories for
all potential target objects, guided by the parsed semantics. Finally, a
hierarchical identification module select the correct target through a
two-stage reasoning process: it first performs coarse-grained motion reasoning
with an LLM to narrow down candidates; if ambiguity remains, a fine-grained
pose verification stage is conditionally triggered to disambiguate. The final
output is an accurate segmentation mask for the target object.
\textbf{PARSE-VOS} achieved state-of-the-art performance on three major
benchmarks: Ref-YouTube-VOS, Ref-DAVIS17, and MeViS.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 慢性疾病需要严格的药物依从性来避免疾病进展和管理症状，但患者行为、医疗成本等因素经常影响依从性。需要开发专门的多模态模型来监测和评估药物依从性。

Method: 使用806个临床专家标注的结核病药物监测视频数据集LLM-TB-VQA，基于Video-LLaVA架构进行微调，识别患者面部、药物、饮水等视觉特征与医疗概念的关联。

Result: 在预训练、常规和LoRA配置下，相比LLaVA-V1.5和Chat-UniVi等模型，性能绝对提升3.1%到3.54%。消融研究和注意力图可视化验证了方法的有效性。

Conclusion: AdCare-VLM通过整合对齐的视觉-语言表示，有效提升了药物依从性监测的多模态交互能力，为慢性疾病管理提供了可行的技术解决方案。

Abstract: Chronic diseases, including diabetes, hypertension, asthma, HIV-AIDS,
epilepsy, and tuberculosis, necessitate rigorous adherence to medication to
avert disease progression, manage symptoms, and decrease mortality rates.
Adherence is frequently undermined by factors including patient behavior,
caregiver support, elevated medical costs, and insufficient healthcare
infrastructure. We propose AdCare-VLM, a specialized Video-LLaVA-based
multimodal large vision language model (LVLM) aimed at visual question
answering (VQA) concerning medication adherence through patient videos. We
employ a private dataset comprising 806 custom-annotated tuberculosis (TB)
medication monitoring videos, which have been labeled by clinical experts, to
fine-tune the model for adherence pattern detection. We present LLM-TB-VQA, a
detailed medical adherence VQA dataset that encompasses positive, negative, and
ambiguous adherence cases. Our method identifies correlations between visual
features, such as the clear visibility of the patient's face, medication, water
intake, and the act of ingestion, and their associated medical concepts in
captions. This facilitates the integration of aligned visual-linguistic
representations and improves multimodal interactions. Experimental results
indicate that our method surpasses parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT)
enabled VLM models, such as LLaVA-V1.5 and Chat-UniVi, with absolute
improvements ranging from 3.1% to 3.54% across pre-trained, regular, and
low-rank adaptation (LoRA) configurations. Comprehensive ablation studies and
attention map visualizations substantiate our approach, enhancing
interpretability.

Abstract: Deciphering oracle bone characters (OBCs), the oldest attested form of
written Chinese, has remained the ultimate, unwavering goal of scholars,
offering an irreplaceable key to understanding humanity's early modes of
production. Current decipherment methodologies of OBC are primarily constrained
by the sporadic nature of archaeological excavations and the limited corpus of
inscriptions. With the powerful visual perception capability of large
multimodal models (LMMs), the potential of using LMMs for visually deciphering
OBCs has increased. In this paper, we introduce PictOBI-20k, a dataset designed
to evaluate LMMs on the visual decipherment tasks of pictographic OBCs. It
includes 20k meticulously collected OBC and real object images, forming over
15k multi-choice questions. We also conduct subjective annotations to
investigate the consistency of the reference point between humans and LMMs in
visual reasoning. Experiments indicate that general LMMs possess preliminary
visual decipherment skills, and LMMs are not effectively using visual
information, while most of the time they are limited by language priors. We
hope that our dataset can facilitate the evaluation and optimization of visual
attention in future OBC-oriented LMMs. The code and dataset will be available
at https://github.com/OBI-Future/PictOBI-20k.

Conclusion: 该方法广泛适用于插件式场景，解决了医学形态重建中姿态对齐的关键问题，为现有模型提供了简单有效的调整方案。

Abstract: In medical imaging, point distribution models are often used to reconstruct
and complete partial shapes using a statistical model of the full shape. A
commonly overlooked, but crucial factor in this reconstruction process, is the
pose of the training data relative to the partial target shape. A difference in
pose alignment of the training and target shape leads to biased solutions,
particularly when observing small parts of a shape. In this paper, we
demonstrate the importance of pose alignment for partial shape reconstructions
and propose an efficient method to adjust an existing model to a specific
target. Our method preserves the computational efficiency of linear models
while significantly improving reconstruction accuracy and predicted variance.
It exactly recovers the intended aligned model for translations, and provides a
good approximation for small rotations, all without access to the original
training data. Hence, existing shape models in reconstruction pipelines can be
adapted by a simple preprocessing step, making our approach widely applicable
in plug-and-play scenarios.

Conclusion: 这篇文章成功开发了第一个基于伪图像表示的两阶段3D检测框架，通过3DPillars结构和稀疏场景特征模块有效充分利用了场景上下文信息，在保持PointPillars高效率的同时显著提升了检测性能。

Abstract: PointPillars is the fastest 3D object detector that exploits pseudo image
representations to encode features for 3D objects in a scene. Albeit efficient,
PointPillars is typically outperformed by state-of-the-art 3D detection methods
due to the following limitations: 1) The pseudo image representations fail to
preserve precise 3D structures, and 2) they make it difficult to adopt a
two-stage detection pipeline using 3D object proposals that typically shows
better performance than a single-stage approach. We introduce in this paper the
first two-stage 3D detection framework exploiting pseudo image representations,
narrowing the performance gaps between PointPillars and state-of-the-art
methods, while retaining its efficiency. Our framework consists of two novel
components that overcome the aforementioned limitations of PointPillars: First,
we introduce a new CNN architecture, dubbed 3DPillars, that enables learning 3D
voxel-based features from the pseudo image representation efficiently using 2D
convolutions. The basic idea behind 3DPillars is that 3D features from voxels
can be viewed as a stack of pseudo images. To implement this idea, we propose a
separable voxel feature module that extracts voxel-based features without using
3D convolutions. Second, we introduce an RoI head with a sparse scene context
feature module that aggregates multi-scale features from 3DPillars to obtain a
sparse scene feature. This enables adopting a two-stage pipeline effectively,
and fully leveraging contextual information of a scene to refine 3D object
proposals. Experimental results on the KITTI and Waymo Open datasets
demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach, achieving a good
compromise in terms of speed and accuracy.

Abstract: Recently, camera-radar fusion-based 3D object detection methods in bird's eye
view (BEV) have gained attention due to the complementary characteristics and
cost-effectiveness of these sensors. Previous approaches using forward
projection struggle with sparse BEV feature generation, while those employing
backward projection overlook depth ambiguity, leading to false positives. In
this paper, to address the aforementioned limitations, we propose a novel
camera-radar fusion-based 3D object detection and segmentation model named CRAB
(Camera-Radar fusion for reducing depth Ambiguity in Backward projection-based
view transformation), using a backward projection that leverages radar to
mitigate depth ambiguity. During the view transformation, CRAB aggregates
perspective view image context features into BEV queries. It improves depth
distinction among queries along the same ray by combining the dense but
unreliable depth distribution from images with the sparse yet precise depth
information from radar occupancy. We further introduce spatial cross-attention
with a feature map containing radar context information to enhance the
comprehension of the 3D scene. When evaluated on the nuScenes open dataset, our
proposed approach achieves a state-of-the-art performance among backward
projection-based camera-radar fusion methods with 62.4\% NDS and 54.0\% mAP in

TL;DR: 本文提出两种注意力导向的自动编码器结构，用于医疗设备制造中的深度异常检测，解决小数据集、高分辨率图像和严格监管要求的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗设备制造业的视觉检测面临小数据集、数据不平衡、高分辨率图像和严格监管要求的挑战，需要符合欧盟AI法案要求的高精度、高效率异常检测方案。

Method: 提出两种注意力导向自动编码器结构：1）基于结构相似性的异常评分方法(4-MS-SSIM)，进行轻量级实时缺陷检测；2）基于马哉诺夫距离的特征距离方法，对缩减的潜在特征进行评分，提高对分布偏移的敏感性。

Result: 第一种方法在只有10%缺陷样本的测试集上达到ACC 0.903(无监督阈值)和0.931(有监督阈值)；第二种方法达到ACC 0.722(有监督阈值)。两种方法都超越了重现的基准方法。

Conclusion: 两种方法具有互补性能：第一种支持可靠的在线检测，第二种支持可扩展的产后监控和监管合规监测。该研究为受监管制造环境中部署深度异常检测提供了实用路径，符合欧盟AI法案对高风险AI系统的要求。

Abstract: Automating visual inspection in medical device manufacturing remains
challenging due to small and imbalanced datasets, high-resolution imagery, and
stringent regulatory requirements. This work proposes two attention-guided
autoencoder architectures for deep anomaly detection designed to address these
constraints. The first employs a structural similarity-based anomaly score
(4-MS-SSIM), offering lightweight and accurate real-time defect detection,
yielding ACC 0.903 (unsupervised thresholding) and 0.931 (supervised
thresholding) on the - Surface Seal Image - Test split with only 10% of
defective samples. The second applies a feature-distance approach using
Mahalanobis scoring on reduced latent features, providing high sensitivity to
distributional shifts for supervisory monitoring, achieving ACC 0.722 with
supervised thresholding. Together, these methods deliver complementary
capabilities: the first supports reliable inline inspection, while the second
enables scalable post-production surveillance and regulatory compliance
monitoring. Experimental results demonstrate that both approaches surpass
re-implemented baselines and provide a practical pathway for deploying deep
anomaly detection in regulated manufacturing environments, aligning accuracy,
efficiency, and the regulatory obligations defined for high-risk AI systems
under the EU AI Act.

*Tyler Ward,Abdullah Imran*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Probabilistic SAM是对Segment Anything Model的概率扩展，通过引入潜在变量空间和变分训练目标，能够生成反映人类标注变异性的多样化分割掩码，特别适用于医学影像中存在的标注不确定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的可提示分割模型（如SAM）是确定性的，只能为每个提示生成单一分割结果，无法捕捉真实世界任务中固有的模糊性。这在医学影像中尤其成问题，因为标注不确定性和专家间差异可能导致多个合理的分割结果。

Method: 在SAM框架中集成先验网络和后验网络，通过潜在变量空间调制提示嵌入，使用变分目标进行训练，学习生成多样化的分割掩码分布。

Result: 在LIDC-IDRI肺结节数据集上的评估显示，Probabilistic SAM能够产生与专家分歧一致的多样化输出，在不确定性感知指标上优于现有概率基线方法。

Conclusion: Probabilistic SAM成功扩展了SAM的概率能力，能够有效建模分割任务中的不确定性，为医学影像分析等需要处理标注变异性的领域提供了有价值的工具。

Abstract: Recent advances in promptable segmentation, such as the Segment Anything
Model (SAM), have enabled flexible, high-quality mask generation across a wide
range of visual domains. However, SAM and similar models remain fundamentally
deterministic, producing a single segmentation per object per prompt, and fail
to capture the inherent ambiguity present in many real-world tasks. This
limitation is particularly troublesome in medical imaging, where multiple
plausible segmentations may exist due to annotation uncertainty or inter-expert
variability. In this paper, we introduce Probabilistic SAM, a probabilistic
extension of SAM that models a distribution over segmentations conditioned on
both the input image and prompt. By incorporating a latent variable space and
training with a variational objective, our model learns to generate diverse and
plausible segmentation masks reflecting the variability in human annotations.
The architecture integrates a prior and posterior network into the SAM
framework, allowing latent codes to modulate the prompt embeddings during
inference. The latent space allows for efficient sampling during inference,
enabling uncertainty-aware outputs with minimal overhead. We evaluate
Probabilistic SAM on the public LIDC-IDRI lung nodule dataset and demonstrate
its ability to produce diverse outputs that align with expert disagreement,
outperforming existing probabilistic baselines on uncertainty-aware metrics.

Motivation: 沙尘暴对健康和能见度造成害处，需要从卫星图像中进行快速检测

Method: 使用3D卷积网络学习MODIS卫星所有36个半光谱港的空间-波段模式，通过简单归一化和局部填充处理缺失数据

Result: 在17个独立MODIS场景中达到0.92的准确率，均方误差为0.014，核心突线区域呈现强一致性，较快版本训练速度提升21倍

Conclusion: 聚合波段-空间学习能够提供全球范围的及时沙尘警报，使用更宽的输入窗口或注意力模型可进一步提升边缘检测效果

Abstract: Dust storms harm health and reduce visibility; quick detection from
satellites is needed. We present a near real-time system that flags dust at the
pixel level using multi-band images from NASA's Terra and Aqua (MODIS). A 3D
convolutional network learns patterns across all 36 bands, plus split thermal
bands, to separate dust from clouds and surface features. Simple normalization
and local filling handle missing data. An improved version raises training
speed by 21x and supports fast processing of full scenes. On 17 independent
MODIS scenes, the model reaches about 0.92 accuracy with a mean squared error
of 0.014. Maps show strong agreement in plume cores, with most misses along
edges. These results show that joint band-and-space learning can provide timely
dust alerts at global scale; using wider input windows or attention-based
models may further sharpen edges.

Conclusion: 标准测试方法在数据稀缺的临床环境中有限制，性能排名不能反映真正的临床价值，需要更加稳健的评估方法。

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of carotid artery structures in histopathological
images is vital for advancing cardiovascular disease research and diagnosis.
However, deep learning model development in this domain is constrained by the
scarcity of annotated cardiovascular histopathological data. This study
investigates a systematic evaluation of state-of-the-art deep learning
segmentation models, including convolutional neural networks (U-Net,
DeepLabV3+), a Vision Transformer (SegFormer), and recent foundation models
(SAM, MedSAM, MedSAM+UNet), on a limited dataset of cardiovascular histology
images. Despite employing an extensive hyperparameter optimization strategy
with Bayesian search, our findings reveal that model performance is highly
sensitive to data splits, with minor differences driven more by statistical
noise than by true algorithmic superiority. This instability exposes the
limitations of standard benchmarking practices in low-data clinical settings
and challenges the assumption that performance rankings reflect meaningful
clinical utility.

<details>

Motivation: 现有方法通过直接拼接处理双时相图像对，无法充分建模时间相关性和空间语义变化，限制了变化理解的视觉-语义对齐效果。

Method: 提出BTCChat模型，包含变化提取模块来捕获时间特征和空间语义变化，以及提示增强机制来增强对空间细节的关注。

Result: 实验结果表明，BTCChat在变化描述和视觉问答任务上达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: BTCChat通过有效建模双时相变化和增强空间细节关注，显著提升了双时相卫星图像分析的能力。

Abstract: Bi-temporal satellite imagery supports critical applications such as urban
development monitoring and disaster assessment. Although powerful multimodal
large language models (MLLMs) have been applied in bi-temporal change analysis,
previous methods process image pairs through direct concatenation, inadequately
modeling temporal correlations and spatial semantic changes. This deficiency
hampers visual-semantic alignment in change understanding, thereby constraining
the overall effectiveness of current approaches. To address this gap, we
propose BTCChat, a multi-temporal MLLM with advanced bi-temporal change
understanding capability. BTCChat supports bi-temporal change captioning and
retains single-image interpretation capability. To better capture temporal
features and spatial semantic changes in image pairs, we design a Change
Extraction module. Moreover, to enhance the model's attention to spatial
details, we introduce a Prompt Augmentation mechanism, which incorporates
contextual clues into the prompt to enhance model performance. Experimental
results demonstrate that BTCChat achieves state-of-the-art performance on
change captioning and visual question answering tasks.

TL;DR: ViSK-GAT是一个多模态深度学习框架，通过结合视觉和骨骼坐标特征来分类肌肉骨骼风险，在复杂环境中实现了93%以上的准确率，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有肌肉骨骼风险评估方法大多依赖单一数据类型，在复杂环境中可靠性不足，需要开发能够融合多模态数据的可靠评估系统。

Method: 提出ViSK-GAT框架，结合残差块和轻量级Transformer块学习时空依赖关系，包含细粒度注意力模块（FGAM）和多模态几何对应模块（MGCM）来实现跨模态特征精炼和对齐。

Result: 验证准确率93.55%，测试准确率93.89%，精确率93.86%，F1分数93.85%，Cohen's Kappa和Matthews相关系数均为93%，均方根误差0.1205，平均绝对误差0.0156，优于9个流行的迁移学习骨干网络。

Conclusion: ViSK-GAT模型推动了人工智能在肌肉骨骼风险分类中的应用，能够实现有效的早期干预，为运动医学领域提供了创新的多模态解决方案。

Abstract: Musculoskeletal disorders pose significant risks to athletes, and assessing
risk early is important for prevention. However, most existing methods are
designed for controlled settings and fail to reliably assess risk in complex
environments due to their reliance on a single type of data. This research
proposes ViSK-GAT (Visual-Skeletal Geometric Attention Transformer), a novel
multimodal deep learning framework designed to classify musculoskeletal risk
using visual and skeletal coordinate-based features. In addition, a custom
multimodal dataset is constructed by combining visual data and skeletal
coordinates for risk assessment. Each sample is labeled into eight risk
categories based on the Rapid Entire Body Assessment system. ViSK-GAT combines
a Residual Block with a Lightweight Transformer Block to learn spatial and
temporal dependencies jointly. It incorporates two novel modules: the
Fine-Grained Attention Module (FGAM), which enables precise inter-modal feature
refinement through cross-attention between visual and skeletal inputs, and the
Multimodal Geometric Correspondence Module (MGCM), which enhances cross-modal
coherence by aligning image features with coordinate-based representations.
ViSK-GAT achieved strong performance with validation and test accuracies of
93.55\% and 93.89\%, respectively; a precision of 93.86\%; an F1 score of
93.85\%; and Cohen's Kappa and Matthews Correlation Coefficient of 93\%. The
regression results also indicated a low Root Mean Square Error of the predicted
probability distribution of 0.1205 and a corresponding Mean Absolute Error of
0.0156. Compared to nine popular transfer learning backbones, ViSK-GAT
consistently outperformed previous methods. The ViSK-GAT model advances
artificial intelligence implementation and application, transforming
musculoskeletal risk classification and enabling impactful early interventions
in sports.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 基于CLIP模型的语义压缩方法，通过压缩特征嵌入而非像素重建，在极低比特率（2-3*10^-3 bpp）下保持语义完整性，性能优于主流图像压缩方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 新兴应用更关注语义保持而非像素级重建，需要跨数据分布和下游任务的鲁棒性能，多模态基础模型的零样本能力为此提供了新思路

Method: 利用对比语言-图像预训练（CLIP）模型，将CLIP特征嵌入压缩为最小比特，同时保持不同任务间的语义信息

Result: 在基准数据集上保持语义完整性，平均比特率约2-3*10^-3 bpp，比主流图像压缩方法所需比特率少95%，在极端压缩下仍具有零样本鲁棒性

Conclusion: 基于CLIP的语义压缩方法在极低比特率下有效保持语义信息，展现出跨数据分布和下游任务的强大零样本鲁棒性能

Abstract: Recent deep learning-based methods for lossy image compression achieve
competitive rate-distortion performance through extensive end-to-end training
and advanced architectures. However, emerging applications increasingly
prioritize semantic preservation over pixel-level reconstruction and demand
robust performance across diverse data distributions and downstream tasks.
These challenges call for advanced semantic compression paradigms. Motivated by
the zero-shot and representational capabilities of multimodal foundation
models, we propose a novel semantic compression method based on the contrastive
language-image pretraining (CLIP) model. Rather than compressing images for
reconstruction, we propose compressing the CLIP feature embeddings into minimal
bits while preserving semantic information across different tasks. Experiments
show that our method maintains semantic integrity across benchmark datasets,
achieving an average bit rate of approximately 2-3* 10(-3) bits per pixel. This
is less than 5% of the bitrate required by mainstream image compression
approaches for comparable performance. Remarkably, even under extreme
compression, the proposed approach exhibits zero-shot robustness across diverse
data distributions and downstream tasks.

Method: 提出AttriPrompt框架，包含属性检索模块（聚类视觉特征并检索语义相似提示）、双流对比学习实现细粒度对齐，以及自正则化机制防止过拟合。

Result: 在三个基准测试中优于最先进方法，在base-to-novel设置下实现了最高7.37%的性能提升，在跨域知识迁移方面表现出色。

Conclusion: 该方法使视觉语言预训练模型成为现实世界应用中更可行的解决方案，通过层次化视觉信息和动态提示机制显著提升了模型性能。

Abstract: The evolution of prompt learning methodologies has driven exploration of
deeper prompt designs to enhance model performance. However, current deep text
prompting approaches suffer from two critical limitations: Over-reliance on
constrastive learning objectives that prioritize high-level semantic alignment,
neglecting fine-grained feature optimization; Static prompts across all input
categories, preventing content-aware adaptation. To address these limitations,
we propose AttriPrompt-a novel framework that enhances and refines textual
semantic representations by leveraging the intermediate-layer features of
CLIP's vision encoder. We designed an Attribute Retrieval module that first
clusters visual features from each layer. The aggregated visual features
retrieve semantically similar prompts from a prompt pool, which are then
concatenated to the input of every layer in the text encoder. Leveraging
hierarchical visual information embedded in prompted text features, we
introduce Dual-stream Contrastive Learning to realize fine-grained alignment.
Furthermore, we introduce a Self-Regularization mechanism by applying explicit
regularization constraints between the prompted and non-prompted text features
to prevent overfitting on limited training data. Extensive experiments across
three benchmarks demonstrate AttriPrompt's superiority over state-of-the-art
methods, achieving up to 7.37\% improvement in the base-to-novel setting. The
observed strength of our method in cross-domain knowledge transfer positions
vision-language pre-trained models as more viable solutions for real-world
implementation.

Motivation: 在Flow Matching模型中应用强化学习需要引入随机性，通常通过SDE实现。但研究发现SDE采样会导致显著的噪声色彩，对奖励学习产生负面影响。

Method: 受DDIM启发，提出Coefficients-Preserving Sampling (CPS)方法，重新定义采样过程，消除SDE采样导致的噪声色彩。

Result: CPS方法能够消除噪声色彩，实现更准确的奖励建模，从而提高了强化学习优化器如Flow-GRPO和Dance-GRPO的收敛速度和稳定性。

Conclusion: 该研究为Flow Matching模型的强化学习应用提供了一种更有效的采样方法，解决了SDE基础方法的限制，促进了图像生成质量的提升。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has recently emerged as a powerful technique for
improving image and video generation in Diffusion and Flow Matching models,
specifically for enhancing output quality and alignment with prompts. A
critical step for applying online RL methods on Flow Matching is the
introduction of stochasticity into the deterministic framework, commonly
realized by Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE). Our investigation reveals a
significant drawback to this approach: SDE-based sampling introduces pronounced
noise artifacts in the generated images, which we found to be detrimental to
the reward learning process. A rigorous theoretical analysis traces the origin
of this noise to an excess of stochasticity injected during inference. To
address this, we draw inspiration from Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models
(DDIM) to reformulate the sampling process. Our proposed method,
Coefficients-Preserving Sampling (CPS), eliminates these noise artifacts. This
leads to more accurate reward modeling, ultimately enabling faster and more
stable convergence for reinforcement learning-based optimizers like Flow-GRPO
and Dance-GRPO. Code will be released at https://github.com/IamCreateAI/FlowCPS

Conclusion: 双向交互融合模块能够有效利用原始和增强图像的互补信息，提高医学图像分割的准确性，特别是在边界区域

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is a crucial method for assisting professionals in
diagnosing various diseases through medical imaging. However, various factors
such as noise, blurriness, and low contrast often hinder the accurate diagnosis
of diseases. While numerous image enhancement techniques can mitigate these
issues, they may also alter crucial information needed for accurate diagnosis
in the original image. Conventional image fusion strategies, such as feature
concatenation can address this challenge. However, they struggle to fully
leverage the advantages of both original and enhanced images while suppressing
the side effects of the enhancements. To overcome the problem, we propose a
dual interactive fusion module (DIFM) that effectively exploits mutual
complementary information from the original and enhanced images. DIFM employs
cross-attention bidirectionally to simultaneously attend to corresponding
spatial information across different images, subsequently refining the
complementary features via global spatial attention. This interaction leverages
low- to high-level features implicitly associated with diverse structural
attributes like edges, blobs, and object shapes, resulting in enhanced features
that embody important spatial characteristics. In addition, we introduce a
multi-scale boundary loss based on gradient extraction to improve segmentation
accuracy at object boundaries. Experimental results on the ACDC and Synapse
datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method quantitatively and
qualitatively. Code available at: https://github.com/JJeong-Gari/DIN

integrates SAB with depthwise separable convolutions and a simple multiscale
fusion strategy, achieving end-to-end efficiency. Extensive experiments on the
KITTI dataset validate StripDet's superiority. With only 0.65M parameters, our
model achieves a 79.97% mAP for car detection, surpassing the baseline
PointPillars with a 7x parameter reduction. Furthermore, StripDet outperforms
recent lightweight and knowledge distillation-based methods, achieving a

Abstract: We propose a novel method to generate bloom lighting effect in real time
using neural networks. Our solution generate brightness mask from given 3D
scene view up to 30% faster than state-of-the-art methods. The existing
traditional techniques rely on multiple blur appliances and texture sampling,
also very often have existing conditional branching in its implementation.
These operations occupy big portion of the execution time. We solve this
problem by proposing two neural network-based bloom lighting methods, Neural
Bloom Lighting (NBL) and Fast Neural Bloom Lighting (FastNBL), focusing on
their quality and performance. Both methods were tested on a variety of 3D
scenes, with evaluations conducted on brightness mask accuracy and inference
speed. The main contribution of this work is that both methods produce
high-quality bloom effects while outperforming the standard state-of-the-art
bloom implementation, with FastNBL being faster by 28% and NBL faster by 12%.
These findings highlight that we can achieve realistic bloom lighting phenomena
faster, moving us towards more realism in real-time environments in the future.
This improvement saves computational resources, which is a major bottleneck in
real-time rendering. Furthermore, it is crucial for sustaining immersion and
ensuring smooth experiences in high FPS environments, while maintaining
high-quality realism.

Conclusion: 该研究提出的方法有效解决了医学3D图像自监督学习中的解释性问题，在保持性能的同时提供了更好的模型学习过程可解释性

Abstract: The application of self-supervised techniques has become increasingly
prevalent within medical visualization tasks, primarily due to its capacity to
mitigate the data scarcity prevalent in the healthcare sector. The majority of
current works are influenced by designs originating in the generic 2D visual
domain, which lack the intuitive demonstration of the model's learning process
regarding 3D spatial knowledge. Consequently, these methods often fall short in
terms of medical interpretability. We propose a method consisting of three
sub-tasks to capture the spatially relevant semantics in medical 3D imaging.
Their design adheres to observable principles to ensure interpretability, and
minimize the performance loss caused thereby as much as possible. By leveraging
the enhanced semantic depth offered by the extra dimension in 3D imaging, this
approach incorporates multi-granularity spatial relationship modeling to
maintain training stability. Experimental findings suggest that our approach is
capable of delivering performance that is on par with current methodologies,
while facilitating an intuitive understanding of the self-supervised learning
process.

Motivation: 艺术风格迁移缺乏真实监督数据，传统方法面临ground-truth数据缺失的根本挑战

Method: 1) 开发文本引导的去风格化模型DST重建无风格内容；2) 使用多阶段评估模型DST-Filter自动筛选高质量数据对；3) 基于DST-100K数据集训练FLUX.1-dev前馈模型

Conclusion: 通过去风格化实现可扩展数据生成提供了可靠的监督范式，解决了艺术风格迁移中ground-truth数据缺乏的根本问题

Abstract: OmniStyle2 introduces a novel approach to artistic style transfer by
reframing it as a data problem. Our key insight is destylization, reversing
style transfer by removing stylistic elements from artworks to recover natural,
style-free counterparts. This yields DST-100K, a large-scale dataset that
provides authentic supervision signals by aligning real artistic styles with
their underlying content. To build DST-100K, we develop (1) DST, a text-guided
destylization model that reconstructs stylefree content, and (2) DST-Filter, a
multi-stage evaluation model that employs Chain-of-Thought reasoning to
automatically discard low-quality pairs while ensuring content fidelity and
style accuracy. Leveraging DST-100K, we train OmniStyle2, a simple feed-forward
model based on FLUX.1-dev. Despite its simplicity, OmniStyle2 consistently
surpasses state-of-the-art methods across both qualitative and quantitative

*Nam Duong Tran,Nam Nguyen Phuong,Hieu H. Pham,Phi Le Nguyen,My T. Thai*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ConstStyle是一种新的领域泛化方法，通过将训练和测试数据映射到统一域来减少领域偏移的影响，在有限训练域和大领域差距情况下表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决深度神经网络在测试数据分布与训练数据不同时的性能下降问题，特别是当训练域有限或训练域与测试域差距较大时，现有方法效果不佳。

Method: 提出ConstStyle方法，利用统一域捕获领域不变特征并弥合领域差距。训练时将样本映射到优化后的统一域，测试时类似投影后再进行预测。

Result: 大量实验表明ConstStyle在各种场景下一致优于现有方法，在仅有有限训练域时，相比次优方法准确率提升高达19.82%。

Conclusion: 通过统一域对齐训练和测试数据，ConstStyle能有效减少领域偏移影响，即使在领域差距大或训练域少的情况下也能显著提升泛化性能。

Abstract: Deep neural networks often suffer performance drops when test data
distribution differs from training data. Domain Generalization (DG) aims to
address this by focusing on domain-invariant features or augmenting data for
greater diversity. However, these methods often struggle with limited training
domains or significant gaps between seen (training) and unseen (test) domains.
To enhance DG robustness, we hypothesize that it is essential for the model to
be trained on data from domains that closely resemble unseen test domains-an
inherently difficult task due to the absence of prior knowledge about the
unseen domains. Accordingly, we propose ConstStyle, a novel approach that
leverages a unified domain to capture domain-invariant features and bridge the
domain gap with theoretical analysis. During training, all samples are mapped
onto this unified domain, optimized for seen domains. During testing, unseen
domain samples are projected similarly before predictions. By aligning both
training and testing data within this unified domain, ConstStyle effectively
reduces the impact of domain shifts, even with large domain gaps or few seen
domains. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ConstStyle consistently
outperforms existing methods across diverse scenarios. Notably, when only a
limited number of seen domains are available, ConstStyle can boost accuracy up
to 19.82\% compared to the next best approach.

TL;DR: 提出STRIDE扩散模型用于稀疏视图CT重建，通过时间变化稀疏条件重加权策略和双网络并行架构，在PSNR、SSIM和MSE指标上显著优于基线方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在图像处理任务中表现出强大的生成能力，但需要针对稀疏视图CT重建的特殊挑战进行优化，包括缺失投影视图补全和全局信息建模

Method: 1) 联合训练机制引导稀疏条件概率学习；2) 时间变化稀疏条件重加权策略动态调整去噪过程权重；3) 线性回归校正分布偏移；4) 双网络并行架构进行全局校正和多子频率分量优化

Result: 在公开和真实数据集上，PSNR提升2.58 dB，SSIM提高2.37%，MSE降低0.236，优于最佳基线方法

Conclusion: STRIDE模型在结构一致性、细节恢复和伪影抑制方面表现出优秀的泛化能力和鲁棒性，实现了高质量的图像重建

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable generative capabilities in
image processing tasks. We propose a Sparse condition Temporal Rewighted
Integrated Distribution Estimation guided diffusion model (STRIDE) for
sparse-view CT reconstruction. Specifically, we design a joint training
mechanism guided by sparse conditional probabilities to facilitate the model
effective learning of missing projection view completion and global information
modeling. Based on systematic theoretical analysis, we propose a temporally
varying sparse condition reweighting guidance strategy to dynamically adjusts
weights during the progressive denoising process from pure noise to the real
image, enabling the model to progressively perceive sparse-view information.
The linear regression is employed to correct distributional shifts between
known and generated data, mitigating inconsistencies arising during the
guidance process. Furthermore, we construct a dual-network parallel
architecture to perform global correction and optimization across multiple
sub-frequency components, thereby effectively improving the model capability in
both detail restoration and structural preservation, ultimately achieving
high-quality image reconstruction. Experimental results on both public and real
datasets demonstrate that the proposed method achieves the best improvement of
2.58 dB in PSNR, increase of 2.37\% in SSIM, and reduction of 0.236 in MSE
compared to the best-performing baseline methods. The reconstructed images
exhibit excellent generalization and robustness in terms of structural
consistency, detail restoration, and artifact suppression.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种解耦策略，通过注入预计算的语义分割信息先验来指导单目3D目标检测，无需扩展检测模型或联合学习先验，在KITTI基准上对小目标检测效果显著提升


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单目3D目标检测由于输入是单张2D图像，缺乏深度信息，是一个不适定问题。现有方法主要依赖CNN或Transformer提取特征，但缺乏对输入数据的深度理解

Method: 采用解耦策略，将预计算的语义分割信息先验直接融合到特征空间中指导检测，不增加检测模型复杂度或额外的预测分支

Result: 在KITTI 3D目标检测基准上表现优异，特别是在行人、自行车等小目标检测上超越了仅使用RGB特征的等效架构

Conclusion: 理解输入数据可以平衡对额外传感器或训练数据的需求，语义分割信息的注入能有效提升单目3D检测性能

Abstract: Monocular 3D Object Detection represents a challenging Computer Vision task
due to the nature of the input used, which is a single 2D image, lacking in any
depth cues and placing the depth estimation problem as an ill-posed one.
Existing solutions leverage the information extracted from the input by using
Convolutional Neural Networks or Transformer architectures as feature
extraction backbones, followed by specific detection heads for 3D parameters
prediction. In this paper, we introduce a decoupled strategy based on injecting
precomputed segmentation information priors and fusing them directly into the
feature space for guiding the detection, without expanding the detection model
or jointly learning the priors. The focus is on evaluating the impact of
additional segmentation information on existing detection pipelines without
adding additional prediction branches. The proposed method is evaluated on the
KITTI 3D Object Detection Benchmark, outperforming the equivalent architecture
that relies only on RGB image features for small objects in the scene:
pedestrians and cyclists, and proving that understanding the input data can
balance the need for additional sensors or training data.

Motivation: 现有的单图像位始估计方法没有利用太空操作中的时序信息，需要一种能够抓取运动动态的方法来提升估计精度

Method: 采用人体位始估计框架，结合Vision Transformer编码器的图像特征和预训练光流模型的运动线索来定位2D关键点，然后使用PnP求解器恢复6自由度位始

Result: 在SPADES-RGB数据集上训练和评估，在不同数据分布的实际和合成数据上进行测试，方法在2D关键点定位和6自由度位始估计方面都显示出更优的性能

Conclusion: 该方法通过利用运动动态信息显著提升了单目视角航天器位始估计的准确性，并具有良好的演化能力，在不同数据分布下都表现出了有前景的性能

Abstract: Monocular 6-DoF pose estimation plays an important role in multiple
spacecraft missions. Most existing pose estimation approaches rely on single
images with static keypoint localisation, failing to exploit valuable temporal
information inherent to space operations. In this work, we adapt a deep
learning framework from human pose estimation to the spacecraft pose estimation
domain that integrates motion-aware heatmaps and optical flow to capture motion
dynamics. Our approach combines image features from a Vision Transformer (ViT)
encoder with motion cues from a pre-trained optical flow model to localise 2D
keypoints. Using the estimates, a Perspective-n-Point (PnP) solver recovers
6-DoF poses from known 2D-3D correspondences. We train and evaluate our method
on the SPADES-RGB dataset and further assess its generalisation on real and
synthetic data from the SPARK-2024 dataset. Overall, our approach demonstrates
improved performance over single-image baselines in both 2D keypoint
localisation and 6-DoF pose estimation. Furthermore, it shows promising
generalisation capabilities when testing on different data distributions.

Abstract: As global interest in diverse culinary experiences grows, food image models
are essential for improving food-related applications by enabling accurate food
recognition, recipe suggestions, dietary tracking, and automated meal planning.
Despite the abundance of food datasets, a noticeable gap remains in capturing
the nuances of Indian cuisine due to its vast regional diversity, complex
preparations, and the lack of comprehensive labeled datasets that cover its
full breadth. Through this exploration, we uncover Khana, a new benchmark
dataset for food image classification, segmentation, and retrieval of dishes
from Indian cuisine. Khana fills the gap by establishing a taxonomy of Indian
cuisine and offering around 131K images in the dataset spread across 80 labels,
each with a resolution of 500x500 pixels. This paper describes the dataset
creation process and evaluates state-of-the-art models on classification,
segmentation, and retrieval as baselines. Khana bridges the gap between
research and development by providing a comprehensive and challenging benchmark
for researchers while also serving as a valuable resource for developers
creating real-world applications that leverage the rich tapestry of Indian
cuisine. Webpage: https://khana.omkar.xyz

TL;DR: BLaVe-CoT是一个针对盲人和低视力用户的VQA框架，通过多答案推理处理视觉问题中的模糊性，在VQA-AnswerTherapy基准测试中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 盲人和低视力用户拍摄的照片往往模糊或构图不佳，提出的视觉问题也经常模糊不清，存在多种有效答案，这与传统VQA系统假设单一答案和区域不匹配。

Method: 使用LoRA调优的BLIP-2模型生成多样候选答案，通过PolyFormer进行空间定位，然后应用思维链推理模块评估答案是否指向相同或不同区域。

Result: 在VQA-AnswerTherapy基准测试中优于先前方法，对辅助环境中常见的模糊性和视觉噪声更具鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 这项工作强调了VQA系统需要适应真实人类不确定性，为盲人和低视力用户提供包容性支持。

Abstract: Visual Question Answering (VQA) holds great potential for assisting Blind and
Low Vision (BLV) users, yet real-world usage remains challenging. Due to visual
impairments, BLV users often take blurry or poorly framed photos and face
difficulty in articulating specific questions about what they cannot fully see.
As a result, their visual questions are frequently ambiguous, and different
users may interpret them in diverse ways. This leads to multiple valid answers,
each grounded in different image regions-posing a mismatch with conventional
VQA systems that assume a single answer and region. To bridge this gap, we
present BLaVe-CoT, a VQA framework designed to reason about answer consistency
in the face of ambiguity. Our method proposes diverse candidate answers using a
LoRA-tuned BLIP-2 model, then grounds each answer spatially using PolyFormer,
and finally applies a chain-of-thought reasoning module to assess whether the
answers refer to the same or different regions. Evaluated on the
VQA-AnswerTherapy benchmark, BLaVe-CoT outperforms previous methods and proves
more robust to the ambiguity and visual noise common in assistive settings.
This work highlights the need for VQA systems that can adapt to real human
uncertainty and provide inclusive support for BLV users. To foster further
research and accessibility applications, we have made the code publicly
available at https://github.com/Accecwan/BLaVe-CoT.

Motivation: 当前的大规模OVD预训练数据集主要是地面级自然图像，导致在UAV图像上性能显著下降，需要解决这个域差问题。

Method: 首先提出了精细化的UAV-Label引擎，构建了UAVDE-2M和UAVCAP-15k两个新数据集。然后提出了跨注意力门控增强融合(CAGE)模块，并嵌入到YOLO-World-v2架构中。

Result: 在VisDrone和SIMD数据集上进行了大量实验，验证了所提方法在UAV图像和遥感应用中的有效性。

Conclusion: 该研究通过构建专门的UAV数据集和提出新的融合模块，成功缩小了域差，为无人机开放词汇物体检测提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Open-Vocabulary Object Detection (OVD) has emerged as a pivotal technology
for applications involving Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). However, the
prevailing large-scale datasets for OVD pre-training are predominantly composed
of ground-level, natural images. This creates a significant domain gap, causing
models trained on them to exhibit a substantial drop in performance on UAV
imagery. To address this limitation, we first propose a refined UAV-Label
engine. Then we construct and introduce UAVDE-2M(contains over 2,000,000
instances and 1800 categories) and UAVCAP-15k(contains over 15,000 images).
Furthermore, we propose a novel Cross-Attention Gated Enhancement Fusion (CAGE)
module and integrate it into the YOLO-World-v2 architecture. Finally, extensive
experiments on the VisDrone and SIMD datasets verify the effectiveness of our
proposed method for applications in UAV-based imagery and remote sensing.

Method: 提出FDP框架，包含新的局部-全局特征感知Transformer用于帧表征学习，通过排序计分器编码动态信息，并使用动态图像构建任务来捕捉面部细微动作和缓解数据稀缺问题。

Result: 在CASME II、SAMM、CAS(ME)^2和CAS(ME)^3数据集上，F1分数分别提升了4.05%、2.50%、7.71%和2.11%，显著超越了最新方法。

Conclusion: 该方法通过动态感知和动态图像构建有效解决了微表情识别中的动态信息捕捉和数据稀缺问题，为该领域提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Facial micro-expression recognition (MER) is a challenging task, due to the
transience, subtlety, and dynamics of micro-expressions (MEs). Most existing
methods resort to hand-crafted features or deep networks, in which the former
often additionally requires key frames, and the latter suffers from small-scale
and low-diversity training data. In this paper, we develop a novel fine-grained
dynamic perception (FDP) framework for MER. We propose to rank frame-level
features of a sequence of raw frames in chronological order, in which the rank
process encodes the dynamic information of both ME appearances and motions.
Specifically, a novel local-global feature-aware transformer is proposed for
frame representation learning. A rank scorer is further adopted to calculate
rank scores of each frame-level feature. Afterwards, the rank features from
rank scorer are pooled in temporal dimension to capture dynamic representation.
Finally, the dynamic representation is shared by a MER module and a dynamic
image construction module, in which the former predicts the ME category, and
the latter uses an encoder-decoder structure to construct the dynamic image.
The design of dynamic image construction task is beneficial for capturing
facial subtle actions associated with MEs and alleviating the data scarcity
issue. Extensive experiments show that our method (i) significantly outperforms
the state-of-the-art MER methods, and (ii) works well for dynamic image
construction. Particularly, our FDP improves by 4.05%, 2.50%, 7.71%, and 2.11%
over the previous best results in terms of F1-score on the CASME II, SAMM,
CAS(ME)^2, and CAS(ME)^3 datasets, respectively. The code is available at

Conclusion: DVLO4D框架通过创新的稀疏时空融合方法，成功解决了传统视觉-LiDAR里程计的局限性，实现了高精度、强鲁棒性和高效率的定位性能，具备实际部署应用价值。

Abstract: Visual-LiDAR odometry is a critical component for autonomous system
localization, yet achieving high accuracy and strong robustness remains a
challenge. Traditional approaches commonly struggle with sensor misalignment,
fail to fully leverage temporal information, and require extensive manual
tuning to handle diverse sensor configurations. To address these problems, we
introduce DVLO4D, a novel visual-LiDAR odometry framework that leverages sparse
spatial-temporal fusion to enhance accuracy and robustness. Our approach
proposes three key innovations: (1) Sparse Query Fusion, which utilizes sparse
LiDAR queries for effective multi-modal data fusion; (2) a Temporal Interaction
and Update module that integrates temporally-predicted positions with current
frame data, providing better initialization values for pose estimation and
enhancing model's robustness against accumulative errors; and (3) a Temporal
Clip Training strategy combined with a Collective Average Loss mechanism that
aggregates losses across multiple frames, enabling global optimization and
reducing the scale drift over long sequences. Extensive experiments on the
KITTI and Argoverse Odometry dataset demonstrate the superiority of our
proposed DVLO4D, which achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of both
pose accuracy and robustness. Additionally, our method has high efficiency,
with an inference time of 82 ms, possessing the potential for the real-time

responded. The findings suggest that general-purpose VLMs are a practical and
promising technology for developing patient-facing tools for preliminary blood

Abstract: Automated inspection of transmission lines using UAVs is hindered by the
difficulty of detecting small and ambiguous defects against complex
backgrounds. Conventional detectors often suffer from detail loss due to
strided downsampling, weak boundary sensitivity in lightweight backbones, and
insufficient integration of global context with local cues. To address these
challenges, we propose TinyDef-DETR, a DETR-based framework designed for
small-defect detection. The method introduces a stride-free space-to-depth
module for lossless downsampling, an edge-enhanced convolution for
boundary-aware feature extraction, a cross-stage dual-domain multi-scale
attention module to jointly capture global and local information, and a
Focaler-Wise-SIoU regression loss to improve localization of small objects.
Experiments conducted on the CSG-ADCD dataset demonstrate that TinyDef-DETR
achieves substantial improvements in both precision and recall compared to
competitive baselines, with particularly notable gains on small-object subsets,
while incurring only modest computational overhead. Further validation on the
VisDrone benchmark confirms the generalization capability of the proposed
approach. Overall, the results indicate that integrating detail-preserving
downsampling, edge-sensitive representations, dual-domain attention, and
difficulty-adaptive regression provides a practical and efficient solution for
UAV-based small-defect inspection in power grids.

Abstract: Recent advancements in aligning image and video generative models via GRPO
have achieved remarkable gains in enhancing human preference alignment.
However, these methods still face high computational costs from on-policy
rollouts and excessive SDE sampling steps, as well as training instability due
to sparse rewards. In this paper, we propose BranchGRPO, a novel method that
introduces a branch sampling policy updating the SDE sampling process. By
sharing computation across common prefixes and pruning low-reward paths and
redundant depths, BranchGRPO substantially lowers the per-update compute cost
while maintaining or improving exploration diversity. This work makes three
main contributions: (1) a branch sampling scheme that reduces rollout and
training cost; (2) a tree-based advantage estimator incorporating dense
process-level rewards; and (3) pruning strategies exploiting path and depth
redundancy to accelerate convergence and boost performance. Experiments on
image and video preference alignment show that BranchGRPO improves alignment
scores by 16% over strong baselines, while cutting training time by 50%.

Abstract: Buoyancy-driven heat transfer in closed cavities serves as a canonical
testbed for thermal design High-fidelity CFD modelling yields accurate thermal
field solutions, yet its reliance on expert-crafted physics models, fine
meshes, and intensive computation limits rapid iteration. Recent developments
in data-driven modeling, especially Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), offer new
alternatives for learning thermal-fluid behavior directly from simulation data,
particularly on irregular mesh structures. However, conventional GNNs often
struggle to capture long-range dependencies in high-resolution graph
structures. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel multi-stage GNN
architecture that leverages hierarchical pooling and unpooling operations to
progressively model global-to-local interactions across multiple spatial
scales. We evaluate the proposed model on our newly developed CFD dataset
simulating natural convection within a rectangular cavities with varying aspect
ratios where the bottom wall is isothermal hot, the top wall is isothermal
cold, and the two vertical walls are adiabatic. Experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed model achieves higher predictive accuracy,
improved training efficiency, and reduced long-term error accumulation compared
to state-of-the-art (SOTA) GNN baselines. These findings underscore the
potential of the proposed multi-stage GNN approach for modeling complex heat
transfer in mesh-based fluid dynamics simulations.

Abstract: We introduce Home-made Diffusion Model (HDM), an efficient yet powerful
text-to-image diffusion model optimized for training (and inferring) on
consumer-grade hardware. HDM achieves competitive 1024x1024 generation quality
while maintaining a remarkably low training cost of $535-620 using four RTX5090
GPUs, representing a significant reduction in computational requirements
compared to traditional approaches. Our key contributions include: (1)
Cross-U-Transformer (XUT), a novel U-shape transformer, Cross-U-Transformer
(XUT), that employs cross-attention for skip connections, providing superior
feature integration that leads to remarkable compositional consistency; (2) a
comprehensive training recipe that incorporates TREAD acceleration, a novel
shifted square crop strategy for efficient arbitrary aspect-ratio training, and
progressive resolution scaling; and (3) an empirical demonstration that smaller
models (343M parameters) with carefully crafted architectures can achieve
high-quality results and emergent capabilities, such as intuitive camera
control. Our work provides an alternative paradigm of scaling, demonstrating a
viable path toward democratizing high-quality text-to-image generation for
individual researchers and smaller organizations with limited computational
resources.

Motivation: 解决同质材料样品在微分边边界处的重建模糊问题，提升投影基微分边射的重建质量

Method: 训练神经网络识别子图片中的边缘，将训练好的网络集成到数学优化模型中，在识别边缘和追寻原始数据支持之间取得平衡

Result: 实验数据集显示了界面尖锐度和材料均质性的显著提升，比对照算法有明显改善

Conclusion: 该技术能够生产高质量的重建图像，为提升微分边射成像技术提供了潜力

Abstract: In this work, we develop a novel technique for reconstructing images from
projection-based nano- and microtomography. Our contribution focuses on
enhancing reconstruction quality, particularly for specimen composed of
homogeneous material phases connected by sharp edges. This is accomplished by
training a neural network to identify edges within subpictures. The trained
network is then integrated into a mathematical optimization model, to reduce
artifacts from previous reconstructions. To this end, the optimization approach
favors solutions according to the learned predictions, however may also
determine alternative solutions if these are strongly supported by the raw
data. Hence, our technique successfully incorporates knowledge about the
homogeneity and presence of sharp edges in the sample and thereby eliminates
blurriness. Our results on experimental datasets show significant enhancements
in interface sharpness and material homogeneity compared to benchmark
algorithms. Thus, our technique produces high-quality reconstructions,
showcasing its potential for advancing tomographic imaging techniques.

TL;DR: MedSeqFT是一个用于医学图像分割的序列微调框架，通过MDS样本选择和K&G RFT知识蒸馏，在保持预训练知识的同时适应新任务，在10个3D分割任务上平均Dice提升3.0%


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有微调策略存在局限性：并行微调隔离任务无法利用共享知识，多任务微调需要同时访问所有数据集且难以增量集成任务

Method: 提出MedSeqFT框架，包含：(1)MDS选择-识别最能代表原始预训练分布的下游样本；(2)K&G RFT-基于LoRA的知识蒸馏方案，平衡任务特定适应和预训练知识保留

Result: 在两个多任务数据集上的实验显示，MedSeqFT始终优于最先进的微调策略，平均Dice提升3.0%，在未见任务上验证了其迁移能力的提升

Conclusion: MedSeqFT建立了序列微调作为一种有效、知识保持的范式，用于将基础模型适应不断演变的临床任务

Abstract: Foundation models have become a promising paradigm for advancing medical
image analysis, particularly for segmentation tasks where downstream
applications often emerge sequentially. Existing fine-tuning strategies,
however, remain limited: parallel fine-tuning isolates tasks and fails to
exploit shared knowledge, while multi-task fine-tuning requires simultaneous
access to all datasets and struggles with incremental task integration. To
address these challenges, we propose MedSeqFT, a sequential fine-tuning
framework that progressively adapts pre-trained models to new tasks while
refining their representational capacity. MedSeqFT introduces two core
components: (1) Maximum Data Similarity (MDS) selection, which identifies
downstream samples most representative of the original pre-training
distribution to preserve general knowledge, and (2) Knowledge and
Generalization Retention Fine-Tuning (K&G RFT), a LoRA-based knowledge
distillation scheme that balances task-specific adaptation with the retention
of pre-trained knowledge. Extensive experiments on two multi-task datasets
covering ten 3D segmentation tasks demonstrate that MedSeqFT consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art fine-tuning strategies, yielding substantial
performance gains (e.g., an average Dice improvement of 3.0%). Furthermore,
evaluations on two unseen tasks (COVID-19-20 and Kidney) verify that MedSeqFT
enhances transferability, particularly for tumor segmentation. Visual analyses
of loss landscapes and parameter variations further highlight the robustness of
MedSeqFT. These results establish sequential fine-tuning as an effective,
knowledge-retentive paradigm for adapting foundation models to evolving
clinical tasks. Code will be released.

Motivation: 病理图像分析对自动化肿瘤诊断至关重要，但现有视觉语言模型难以捕捉结构化病理报告所需的复杂推理，限制了在临床环境中的应用。

Method: 提出了PathoHR-Bench基准测试，并开发了一种病理学特定的视觉语言训练方案，通过生成增强和扰动样本进行多模态对比学习。

Result: 实验评估表明，该方法在PathoHR-Bench和六个额外病理数据集上达到了最先进的性能，在细粒度病理表示方面表现出色。

Conclusion: 该研究为解决病理图像分析中的挑战提供了有效的基准测试和训练方案，显著提升了视觉语言模型在病理学领域的应用能力。

Abstract: Accurate analysis of pathological images is essential for automated tumor
diagnosis but remains challenging due to high structural similarity and subtle
morphological variations in tissue images. Current vision-language (VL) models
often struggle to capture the complex reasoning required for interpreting
structured pathological reports. To address these limitations, we propose
PathoHR-Bench, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate VL models' abilities in
hierarchical semantic understanding and compositional reasoning within the
pathology domain. Results of this benchmark reveal that existing VL models fail
to effectively model intricate cross-modal relationships, hence limiting their
applicability in clinical setting. To overcome this, we further introduce a
pathology-specific VL training scheme that generates enhanced and perturbed
samples for multimodal contrastive learning. Experimental evaluations
demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on
PathoHR-Bench and six additional pathology datasets, highlighting its
effectiveness in fine-grained pathology representation.

*Giulia Bonino,Luca Alberto Rizzo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CARDIE是一个基于颜色和亮度内容的无监督图像聚类算法，专门针对图像增强任务设计，相比基于语义属性的聚类方法更有效，并能通过重采样提升色调映射和去噪算法的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动图像聚类在计算机视觉中很重要，但在图像增强应用中受限，主要因为难以定义对该任务有意义的聚类。现有方法基于语义属性，但对图像增强不够相关。

Method: 提出CARDIE无监督算法，基于图像的颜色和亮度内容进行聚类。同时引入量化图像增强算法对亮度分布和局部方差影响的方法。

Result: CARDIE产生的聚类比基于语义属性的聚类更适用于图像增强任务。利用CARDIE聚类重采样图像增强数据集，可以提升色调映射和去噪算法的性能。

Conclusion: CARDIE为图像增强任务提供了更相关的聚类方法，代码已开源以促进采用和确保可复现性。

Abstract: Automatic image clustering is a cornerstone of computer vision, yet its
application to image enhancement remains limited, primarily due to the
difficulty of defining clusters that are meaningful for this specific task. To
address this issue, we introduce CARDIE, an unsupervised algorithm that
clusters images based on their color and luminosity content. In addition, we
introduce a method to quantify the impact of image enhancement algorithms on
luminance distribution and local variance. Using this method, we demonstrate
that CARDIE produces clusters more relevant to image enhancement than those
derived from semantic image attributes. Furthermore, we demonstrate that CARDIE
clusters can be leveraged to resample image enhancement datasets, leading to
improved performance for tone mapping and denoising algorithms. To encourage
adoption and ensure reproducibility, we publicly release CARDIE code on our
GitHub.

*Tang Sui,Songxi Yang,Qunying Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SpecSwin3D是一个基于Transformer的模型，能够从5个多光谱波段生成224个高光谱波段，在保持空间和光谱质量的同时显著提升了重建性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多光谱和高光谱图像在农业、环境监测等领域有广泛应用，但存在空间分辨率与光谱分辨率的权衡问题。现有方法难以同时保持空间细节和光谱保真度。

Method: 提出SpecSwin3D模型，采用3D移位窗口Transformer框架，引入级联训练策略逐步扩展光谱范围，并设计优化的波段序列来更好地捕捉波段间关系。

Result: 模型在PSNR达到35.82dB，SAM为2.40°，SSIM为0.96，相比基线MHF-Net提升5.6dB PSNR，ERGAS降低一半以上。在下游任务如土地利用分类和烧毁区域分割中也表现出实用价值。

Conclusion: SpecSwin3D成功解决了多光谱到高光谱转换中的空间-光谱权衡问题，为高光谱图像生成提供了有效的解决方案，并在实际应用中展现出良好性能。

Abstract: Multispectral and hyperspectral imagery are widely used in agriculture,
environmental monitoring, and urban planning due to their complementary spatial
and spectral characteristics. A fundamental trade-off persists: multispectral
imagery offers high spatial but limited spectral resolution, while
hyperspectral imagery provides rich spectra at lower spatial resolution. Prior
hyperspectral generation approaches (e.g., pan-sharpening variants, matrix
factorization, CNNs) often struggle to jointly preserve spatial detail and
spectral fidelity. In response, we propose SpecSwin3D, a transformer-based
model that generates hyperspectral imagery from multispectral inputs while
preserving both spatial and spectral quality. Specifically, SpecSwin3D takes
five multispectral bands as input and reconstructs 224 hyperspectral bands at
the same spatial resolution. In addition, we observe that reconstruction errors
grow for hyperspectral bands spectrally distant from the input bands. To
address this, we introduce a cascade training strategy that progressively
expands the spectral range to stabilize learning and improve fidelity.
Moreover, we design an optimized band sequence that strategically repeats and
orders the five selected multispectral bands to better capture pairwise
relations within a 3D shifted-window transformer framework. Quantitatively, our
model achieves a PSNR of 35.82 dB, SAM of 2.40{\deg}, and SSIM of 0.96,
outperforming the baseline MHF-Net by +5.6 dB in PSNR and reducing ERGAS by
more than half. Beyond reconstruction, we further demonstrate the practical
value of SpecSwin3D on two downstream tasks, including land use classification
and burnt area segmentation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出RetinaGuard框架，通过生成对抗掩蔽机制保护视网膜图像中的年龄隐私，同时保持图像质量和疾病诊断价值。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI从医学图像中提取生物标志物（如视网膜年龄）存在隐私风险，未经授权使用可能导致生物信息泄露。

Method: 采用特征级生成对抗掩蔽机制，结合多对一知识蒸馏策略，使用视网膜基础模型和多种替代年龄编码器。

Result: RetinaGuard成功混淆视网膜年龄预测，对图像质量和病理特征表示影响最小。

Conclusion: 该框架可有效保护视网膜年龄隐私，且可扩展到其他医学图像生物标志物的隐私保护。

Abstract: The integration of AI with medical images enables the extraction of implicit
image-derived biomarkers for a precise health assessment. Recently, retinal
age, a biomarker predicted from fundus images, is a proven predictor of
systemic disease risks, behavioral patterns, aging trajectory and even
mortality. However, the capability to infer such sensitive biometric data
raises significant privacy risks, where unauthorized use of fundus images could
lead to bioinformation leakage, breaching individual privacy. In response, we
formulate a new research problem of biometric privacy associated with medical
images and propose RetinaGuard, a novel privacy-enhancing framework that
employs a feature-level generative adversarial masking mechanism to obscure
retinal age while preserving image visual quality and disease diagnostic
utility. The framework further utilizes a novel multiple-to-one knowledge
distillation strategy incorporating a retinal foundation model and diverse
surrogate age encoders to enable a universal defense against black-box age
prediction models. Comprehensive evaluations confirm that RetinaGuard
successfully obfuscates retinal age prediction with minimal impact on image
quality and pathological feature representation. RetinaGuard is also flexible
for extension to other medical image derived biomarkers. RetinaGuard is also
flexible for extension to other medical image biomarkers.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决音频-视频生成中训练效率低和标注对齐问题，避免从头训练带来的性能下降，同时充分利用预训练模型的基础能力。

Method: 采用专家拼接(SoE)技术深度融合预训练的视频和音乐生成专家模型，开发在线标注流程处理训练数据并生成标签，避免基于文本标注的错位问题。

Result: 在7600小时音视频数据上微调后，模型在环境声音生成方面产生良好协调的音视频内容，在语音生成方面具有强对齐性，并发布了Verse-Bench基准数据集。

Conclusion: UniVerse-1通过创新的专家拼接和在线标注技术，有效解决了音视频生成的对齐问题，为研究社区提供了有价值的资源和基准，有助于缩小与Veo3等先进模型的性能差距。

Abstract: We introduce UniVerse-1, a unified, Veo-3-like model capable of
simultaneously generating coordinated audio and video. To enhance training
efficiency, we bypass training from scratch and instead employ a stitching of
experts (SoE) technique. This approach deeply fuses the corresponding blocks of
pre-trained video and music generation experts models, thereby fully leveraging
their foundational capabilities. To ensure accurate annotations and temporal
alignment for both ambient sounds and speech with video content, we developed
an online annotation pipeline that processes the required training data and
generates labels during training process. This strategy circumvents the
performance degradation often caused by misalignment text-based annotations.
Through the synergy of these techniques, our model, after being finetuned on
approximately 7,600 hours of audio-video data, produces results with
well-coordinated audio-visuals for ambient sounds generation and strong
alignment for speech generation. To systematically evaluate our proposed
method, we introduce Verse-Bench, a new benchmark dataset. In an effort to
advance research in audio-video generation and to close the performance gap
with state-of-the-art models such as Veo3, we make our model and code publicly
available. We hope this contribution will benefit the broader research
community. Project page: https://dorniwang.github.io/UniVerse-1/.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UNO是一个统一的单阶段视频场景图生成框架，可同时处理粗粒度边界框级别和细粒度像素级别的任务，通过扩展的slot attention机制和时序一致性学习实现高效统一的物体中心表示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视频场景图生成方法通常针对特定粒度（边界框或像素级别）设计，需要任务特定的架构和多阶段训练流程，缺乏统一的解决方案。

Method: 提出UNO框架，使用扩展的slot attention机制将视觉特征分解为物体和关系slot，引入物体时序一致性学习确保跨帧表示一致性，动态三元组预测模块捕捉时序交互。

Result: 在标准边界框级别和像素级别VidSGG基准测试中达到竞争性性能，同时通过统一设计提高了效率。

Conclusion: UNO证明了统一框架在视频场景图生成任务中的有效性，能够泛化到不同视觉粒度级别，最小化任务特定修改并最大化参数共享。

Abstract: Video Scene Graph Generation (VidSGG) aims to represent dynamic visual
content by detecting objects and modeling their temporal interactions as
structured graphs. Prior studies typically target either coarse-grained
box-level or fine-grained panoptic pixel-level VidSGG, often requiring
task-specific architectures and multi-stage training pipelines. In this paper,
we present UNO (UNified Object-centric VidSGG), a single-stage, unified
framework that jointly addresses both tasks within an end-to-end architecture.
UNO is designed to minimize task-specific modifications and maximize parameter
sharing, enabling generalization across different levels of visual granularity.
The core of UNO is an extended slot attention mechanism that decomposes visual
features into object and relation slots. To ensure robust temporal modeling, we
introduce object temporal consistency learning, which enforces consistent
object representations across frames without relying on explicit tracking
modules. Additionally, a dynamic triplet prediction module links relation slots
to corresponding object pairs, capturing evolving interactions over time. We
evaluate UNO on standard box-level and pixel-level VidSGG benchmarks. Results
demonstrate that UNO not only achieves competitive performance across both
tasks but also offers improved efficiency through a unified, object-centric
design.

Motivation: 解决全球骨折诊断挑战，特别是在资源匮乏地区缺乏专业放射科医生的问题，传统方法成本高且有辐射风险

Method: 使用自定义卷积神经网络(CNN)，并与EfficientNetB0、MobileNetV2、ResNet50等迁移学习模型进行对比，在包含4,083张X光片的FracAtlas数据集上训练

Result: 自定义CNN达到95.96%准确率、0.94精确率、0.88召回率和0.91 F1分数，迁移学习模型在此设置下表现较差

Conclusion: 轻量级CNN在X光骨折检测中具有潜力，但需要公平基准测试、多样化数据集和外部验证才能实现临床转化

Abstract: Bone fractures present a major global health challenge, often resulting in
pain, reduced mobility, and productivity loss, particularly in low-resource
settings where access to expert radiology services is limited. Conventional
imaging methods suffer from high costs, radiation exposure, and dependency on
specialized interpretation. To address this, we developed an AI-based solution
for automated fracture detection from X-ray images using a custom Convolutional
Neural Network (CNN) and benchmarked it against transfer learning models
including EfficientNetB0, MobileNetV2, and ResNet50. Training was conducted on
the publicly available FracAtlas dataset, comprising 4,083 anonymized
musculoskeletal radiographs. The custom CNN achieved 95.96% accuracy, 0.94
precision, 0.88 recall, and an F1-score of 0.91 on the FracAtlas dataset.
Although transfer learning models (EfficientNetB0, MobileNetV2, ResNet50)
performed poorly in this specific setup, these results should be interpreted in
light of class imbalance and data set limitations. This work highlights the
promise of lightweight CNNs for detecting fractures in X-rays and underscores
the importance of fair benchmarking, diverse datasets, and external validation
for clinical translation

Conclusion: 通过适配现有轻量级检测网络，可以实现高效的文档检测和置直流水线，为实时文档信息提取提供了一种小幅但高效的解决方案

Abstract: Object Recognition and Document Skew Estimation have come a long way in terms
of performance and efficiency. New models follow one of two directions:
improving performance using larger models, and improving efficiency using
smaller models. However, real-time document detection and rectification is a
niche that is largely unexplored by the literature, yet it remains a vital step
for automatic information retrieval from visual documents. In this work, we
strive towards an efficient document detection pipeline that is satisfactory in
terms of Optical Character Recognition (OCR) retrieval and faster than other
available solutions. We adapt IWPOD-Net, a license plate detection network, and
train it for detection on NBID, a synthetic ID card dataset. We experiment with
data augmentation and cross-dataset validation with MIDV (another synthetic ID
and passport document dataset) to find the optimal scenario for the model.
Other methods from both the Object Recognition and Skew Estimation
state-of-the-art are evaluated for comparison with our approach. We use each
method to detect and rectify the document, which is then read by an OCR system.
The OCR output is then evaluated using a novel OCR quality metric based on the
Levenshtein distance. Since the end goal is to improve automatic information
retrieval, we use the overall OCR quality as a performance metric. We observe
that with a promising model, document rectification does not have to be perfect
to attain state-of-the-art performance scores. We show that our model is
smaller and more efficient than current state-of-the-art solutions while
retaining a competitive OCR quality metric. All code is available at

Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型在3D空间关系理解方面存在明显不足，而现实世界的具身AI智能体（如机器人和自动驾驶汽车）需要基于自我中心多视角观测进行空间推理。

Method: 创建了包含8,600多个质量问答对的Ego3D-Bench基准测试，并提出了Ego3D-VLM后训练框架，通过生成基于估计全局3D坐标的认知地图来增强空间推理能力。

Result: 基准测试显示当前SOTA VLMs与人类水平存在显著差距，Ego3D-VLM在多选题问答上平均提升12%，在绝对距离估计上平均提升56%。

Conclusion: Ego3D-Bench和Ego3D-VLM为在多视角环境中实现人类水平空间理解提供了有价值的工具，当前VLMs仍需大幅改进才能达到人类的空间理解水平。

Abstract: Understanding 3D spatial relationships remains a major limitation of current
Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Prior work has addressed this issue by creating
spatial question-answering (QA) datasets based on single images or indoor
videos. However, real-world embodied AI agents such as robots and self-driving
cars typically rely on ego-centric, multi-view observations. To this end, we
introduce Ego3D-Bench, a new benchmark designed to evaluate the spatial
reasoning abilities of VLMs using ego-centric, multi-view outdoor data.
Ego3D-Bench comprises over 8,600 QA pairs, created with significant involvement
from human annotators to ensure quality and diversity. We benchmark 16 SOTA
VLMs, including GPT-4o, Gemini1.5-Pro, InternVL3, and Qwen2.5-VL. Our results
reveal a notable performance gap between human level scores and VLM
performance, highlighting that current VLMs still fall short of human level
spatial understanding. To bridge this gap, we propose Ego3D-VLM, a
post-training framework that enhances 3D spatial reasoning of VLMs. Ego3D-VLM
generates cognitive map based on estimated global 3D coordinates, resulting in
12% average improvement on multi-choice QA and 56% average improvement on
absolute distance estimation. Ego3D-VLM is modular and can be integrated with
any existing VLM. Together, Ego3D-Bench and Ego3D-VLM offer valuable tools for
advancing toward human level spatial understanding in real-world, multi-view

Method: 构建了一个系统性解决方案，包括SH/TEWL数据收集、数据预处理和新题的Skin-Prior Adaptive Vision Transformer模型，使用对称基对比正则化来减少数据不平衡导致的偏差

Result: 该研究首次实现了从自拍面部图像进行皮肤评估，无需物理测量仪器

Conclusion: 该方案桥接了计算机视觉与护肤研究的间隔，为广泛的实际应用开启了AI驱动的可访皮肤分析

Abstract: Skin health and disease resistance are closely linked to the skin barrier
function, which protects against environmental factors and water loss. Two key
physiological indicators can quantitatively represent this barrier function:
skin hydration (SH) and trans-epidermal water loss (TEWL). Measurement of SH
and TEWL is valuable for the public to monitor skin conditions regularly,
diagnose dermatological issues, and personalize their skincare regimens.
However, these measurements are not easily accessible to general users unless
they visit a dermatology clinic with specialized instruments. To tackle this
problem, we propose a systematic solution to estimate SH and TEWL from selfie
facial images remotely with smartphones. Our solution encompasses multiple
stages, including SH/TEWL data collection, data preprocessing, and formulating
a novel Skin-Prior Adaptive Vision Transformer model for SH/TEWL regression.
Through experiments, we identified the annotation imbalance of the SH/TEWL data
and proposed a symmetric-based contrastive regularization to reduce the model
bias due to the imbalance effectively. This work is the first study to explore
skin assessment from selfie facial images without physical measurements. It
bridges the gap between computer vision and skin care research, enabling
AI-driven accessible skin analysis for broader real-world applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于transformer的方法在标准场景定位表现良好，但在开放词汇场景（包含未见过的对象类别）存在三个主要限制：视觉-语言模态对齐不完美、跨模态特征融合不足、语义原型信息利用不充分

Method: 提出PAML框架：1)使用ALBEF进行跨模态对齐；2)视觉判别特征编码器增强显著对象表示；3)原型发现和继承机制提取聚合多邻居语义原型；4)多阶段解码器进行综合多模态整合

Result: 在五个基准数据集上的广泛实验验证了该方法，在标准场景表现有竞争力，在开放词汇场景达到最先进结果

Conclusion: PAML框架通过系统解决跨模态对齐、特征融合和原型利用问题，有效提升了开放词汇视觉定位性能

Abstract: Visual Grounding (VG) aims to utilize given natural language queries to
locate specific target objects within images. While current transformer-based
approaches demonstrate strong localization performance in standard scene (i.e,
scenarios without any novel objects), they exhibit notable limitations in
open-vocabulary scene (i.e, both familiar and novel object categories during
testing). These limitations primarily stem from three key factors: (1)
imperfect alignment between visual and linguistic modalities, (2) insufficient
cross-modal feature fusion, and (3) ineffective utilization of semantic
prototype information. To overcome these challenges, we present Prototype-Aware
Multimodal Learning (PAML), an innovative framework that systematically
addresses these issues through several key components: First, we leverage ALBEF
to establish robust cross-modal alignment during initial feature encoding.
Subsequently, our Visual Discriminative Feature Encoder selectively enhances
salient object representations while suppressing irrelevant visual context. The
framework then incorporates a novel prototype discovering and inheriting
mechanism that extracts and aggregates multi-neighbor semantic prototypes to
facilitate open-vocabulary recognition. These enriched features undergo
comprehensive multimodal integration through our Multi-stage Decoder before
final bounding box regression. Extensive experiments across five benchmark
datasets validate our approach, showing competitive performance in standard
scene while achieving state-of-the-art results in open-vocabulary scene. Our

*Zhang Jing,Pu Nan,Xie Yu Xiang,Guo Yanming,Lu Qianqi,Zou Shiwei,Yan Jie,Chen Yan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了视频领域的广义类别发现(Video-GCD)问题，并设计了一种新的内存导向一致性对比学习框架(MCCL)，通过时空线索和全局上下文来提升新类别发现的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的GCD方法主要聚焦于静态图像，但仅依靠静态视觉内容不能可靠地发现新类别。需要将GCD扩展到视频领域，利用时间维度信息来提升发现能力。

Method: 提出MCCL框架，包含两个核心组件：一致性对比学习(CACL)和内存导向表征增强(MGRE)。CACL利用多视角时间特征估计一致性分数，MGRE通过双级内存缓冲区提供全局上下文来优化表征学习。

Result: 在行为识别和鸟类分类视频数据集上进行了广泛实验，结果显示该方法显著超过了来自图像基础设置的竞争性GCD方法。

Conclusion: 这项研究强调了时间信息在视频中发现新类别的重要性，提出的MCCL框架通过时空线索和全局上下文的有效结合，为Video-GCD问题提供了一种有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) is an emerging and challenging
open-world problem that has garnered increasing attention in recent years. Most
existing GCD methods focus on discovering categories in static images. However,
relying solely on static visual content is often insufficient to reliably
discover novel categories. To bridge this gap, we extend the GCD problem to the
video domain and introduce a new setting, termed Video-GCD. Thus, effectively
integrating multi-perspective information across time is crucial for accurate
Video-GCD. To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel Memory-guided
Consistency-aware Contrastive Learning (MCCL) framework, which explicitly
captures temporal-spatial cues and incorporates them into contrastive learning
through a consistency-guided voting mechanism. MCCL consists of two core
components: Consistency-Aware Contrastive Learning(CACL) and Memory-Guided
Representation Enhancement (MGRE). CACL exploits multiperspective temporal
features to estimate consistency scores between unlabeled instances, which are
then used to weight the contrastive loss accordingly. MGRE introduces a
dual-level memory buffer that maintains both feature-level and logit-level
representations, providing global context to enhance intra-class compactness
and inter-class separability. This in turn refines the consistency estimation
in CACL, forming a mutually reinforcing feedback loop between representation
learning and consistency modeling. To facilitate a comprehensive evaluation, we
construct a new and challenging Video-GCD benchmark, which includes action
recognition and bird classification video datasets. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms competitive GCD
approaches adapted from image-based settings, highlighting the importance of
temporal information for discovering novel categories in videos. The code will
be publicly available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在视觉语言任务中表现出色，但如何有效整合图像分割仍是一个重大挑战，需要简化分割过程并提高效率。

Method: 引入语义描述符作为分割掩码的文本表示，包括图像级和框级语义描述符；提出行级游程编码(R-RLE)压缩冗余文本；将分割建模为下一个砖块预测任务。

Result: 在自然和遥感数据集上的综合实验表明，Text4Seg++在多样化基准测试中始终优于最先进模型，无需任务特定微调，推理速度提升3倍。

Conclusion: 该工作证明了在MLLM框架内文本驱动图像分割的有效性、可扩展性和泛化能力，为简化分割流程提供了新思路。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown exceptional capabilities
in vision-language tasks. However, effectively integrating image segmentation
into these models remains a significant challenge. In this work, we propose a
novel text-as-mask paradigm that casts image segmentation as a text generation
problem, eliminating the need for additional decoders and significantly
simplifying the segmentation process. Our key innovation is semantic
descriptors, a new textual representation of segmentation masks where each
image patch is mapped to its corresponding text label. We first introduce
image-wise semantic descriptors, a patch-aligned textual representation of
segmentation masks that integrates naturally into the language modeling
pipeline. To enhance efficiency, we introduce the Row-wise Run-Length Encoding
(R-RLE), which compresses redundant text sequences, reducing the length of
semantic descriptors by 74% and accelerating inference by $3\times$, without
compromising performance. Building upon this, our initial framework Text4Seg
achieves strong segmentation performance across a wide range of vision tasks.
To further improve granularity and compactness, we propose box-wise semantic
descriptors, which localizes regions of interest using bounding boxes and
represents region masks via structured mask tokens called semantic bricks. This
leads to our refined model, Text4Seg++, which formulates segmentation as a
next-brick prediction task, combining precision, scalability, and generative
efficiency. Comprehensive experiments on natural and remote sensing datasets
show that Text4Seg++ consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models across
diverse benchmarks without any task-specific fine-tuning, while remaining
compatible with existing MLLM backbones. Our work highlights the effectiveness,
scalability, and generalizability of text-driven image segmentation within the
MLLM framework.

Abstract: The precise characterization of plant morphology provides valuable insights
into plant environment interactions and genetic evolution. A key technology for
extracting this information is 3D segmentation, which delineates individual
plant organs from complex point clouds. Despite significant progress in general
3D computer vision domains, the adoption of 3D segmentation for plant
phenotyping remains limited by three major challenges: i) the scarcity of
large-scale annotated datasets, ii) technical difficulties in adapting advanced
deep neural networks to plant point clouds, and iii) the lack of standardized
benchmarks and evaluation protocols tailored to plant science. This review
systematically addresses these barriers by: i) providing an overview of
existing 3D plant datasets in the context of general 3D segmentation domains,
ii) systematically summarizing deep learning-based methods for point cloud
semantic and instance segmentation, iii) introducing Plant Segmentation Studio
(PSS), an open-source framework for reproducible benchmarking, and iv)
conducting extensive quantitative experiments to evaluate representative
networks and sim-to-real learning strategies. Our findings highlight the
efficacy of sparse convolutional backbones and transformer-based instance
segmentation, while also emphasizing the complementary role of modeling-based
and augmentation-based synthetic data generation for sim-to-real learning in
reducing annotation demands. In general, this study bridges the gap between
algorithmic advances and practical deployment, providing immediate tools for
researchers and a roadmap for developing data-efficient and generalizable deep
learning solutions in 3D plant phenotyping. Data and code are available at

Motivation: 现有货币识别系统往往忽视可用性和真实性评估，特别是在低资源环境中，视觉障碍用户和离线验证很常见。现有方法主要关注面额分类，但忽略了物理损坏和伪造问题

Method: 使用轻量级CNN模型进行面额分类，通过新颖的统一货币损坏指数(UCDI)进行损坏量化，采用基于特征的模板匹配进行假币检测。数据集包含82,000多张标注图像

Conclusion: 该框架支持实时设备端推理，解决了受限环境中的关键部署挑战，证明准确、可解释且紧凑的解决方案可以在实际场景中支持包容性货币评估

Abstract: Currency recognition systems often overlook usability and authenticity
assessment, especially in low-resource environments where visually impaired
users and offline validation are common. While existing methods focus on
denomination classification, they typically ignore physical degradation and
forgery, limiting their applicability in real-world conditions. This paper
presents a unified framework for currency evaluation that integrates three
modules: denomination classification using lightweight CNN models, damage
quantification through a novel Unified Currency Damage Index (UCDI), and
counterfeit detection using feature-based template matching. The dataset
consists of over 82,000 annotated images spanning clean, damaged, and
counterfeit notes. Our Custom_CNN model achieves high classification
performance with low parameter count. The UCDI metric provides a continuous
usability score based on binary mask loss, chromatic distortion, and structural
feature loss. The counterfeit detection module demonstrates reliable
identification of forged notes across varied imaging conditions. The framework
supports real-time, on-device inference and addresses key deployment challenges
in constrained environments. Results show that accurate, interpretable, and
compact solutions can support inclusive currency evaluation in practical
settings.

Motivation: 时间敏感视频理解任务可以从帧内基础物体中获益，但文本描述方式会导致令牌长度增加和噪声敏感

Method: 设计GO-Tokenizer轻量添加模块，利用现成物体检测器动态编码紧凑的物体信息

Result: 预训练使用GO-Tokenizer的模型在性能上超过原始Video-LLM和使用文本描述的对照组

Conclusion: GO-Tokenizer能够在不同模型、数据集和视频理解任务中广泛提升性能，包括理性时间定位和密集描述

Abstract: We propose to improve the time-sensitive video understanding (TSV) capability
of video large language models (Video-LLMs) with grounded objects (GO). We
hypothesize that TSV tasks can benefit from GO within frames, which is
supported by our preliminary experiments on LITA, a state-of-the-art Video-LLM
for reasoning temporal localization. While augmenting prompts with textual
description of these object annotations improves the performance of LITA, it
also introduces extra token length and susceptibility to the noise in object
level information. To address this, we propose GO-Tokenizer, a lightweight
add-on module for Video-LLMs leveraging off-the-shelf object detectors to
encode compact object information on the fly. Experimental results demonstrate
that pretraining with GO-Tokenizer outperforms the vanilla Video-LLM and its
counterpart utilizing textual description of objects in the prompt. The gain
generalizes across different models, datasets and video understanding tasks
such as reasoning temporal localization and dense captioning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于CLIP的面部防伪方法未能充分利用CLIP的补丁嵌入令牌，且依赖单一文本提示，限制了泛化能力。

Method: 提出MVP-FAS框架，包含多视角注意力模块(MVS)和多文本补丁对齐模块(MTPA)，利用多个改写文本来生成泛化特征。

Result: 在跨域数据集上超越了之前的最先进方法，表现出优越的泛化性能。

Conclusion: MVP-FAS通过多文本表示和补丁对齐技术，有效提升了面部防伪的跨域泛化能力。

Abstract: Recent face anti-spoofing (FAS) methods have shown remarkable cross-domain
performance by employing vision-language models like CLIP. However, existing
CLIP-based FAS models do not fully exploit CLIP's patch embedding tokens,
failing to detect critical spoofing clues. Moreover, these models rely on a
single text prompt per class (e.g., 'live' or 'fake'), which limits
generalization. To address these issues, we propose MVP-FAS, a novel framework
incorporating two key modules: Multi-View Slot attention (MVS) and Multi-Text
Patch Alignment (MTPA). Both modules utilize multiple paraphrased texts to
generate generalized features and reduce dependence on domain-specific text.
MVS extracts local detailed spatial features and global context from patch
embeddings by leveraging diverse texts with multiple perspectives. MTPA aligns
patches with multiple text representations to improve semantic robustness.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that MVP-FAS achieves superior generalization
performance, outperforming previous state-of-the-art methods on cross-domain
datasets. Code: https://github.com/Elune001/MVP-FAS.

Abstract: Colorectal diseases, including inflammatory conditions and neoplasms, require
quick, accurate care to be effectively treated. Traditional diagnostic
pipelines require extensive preparation and rely on separate, individual
evaluations on histological images and colonoscopy footage, introducing
possible variability and inefficiencies. This pilot study proposes a unified
deep learning network that uses convolutional neural networks (CN N s) to
classify both histopathological slides and colonoscopy video frames in one
pipeline. The pipeline integrates class-balancing learning, robust
augmentation, and calibration methods to ensure accurate results. Static colon
histology images were taken from the PathMNIST dataset, and the lower
gastrointestinal (colonoscopy) videos were drawn from the HyperKvasir dataset.
The CNN architecture used was ResNet-50. This study demonstrates an
interpretable and reproducible diagnostic pipeline that unifies multiple
diagnostic modalities to advance and ease the detection of colorectal diseases.

Conclusion: 该方法为精准农业提供了一种实用、可扩展且适应性强的干旱监测解决方案，特别适用于资源受限的环境。

Abstract: Drought stress is a major threat to global crop productivity, making its
early and precise detection essential for sustainable agricultural management.
Traditional approaches, though useful, are often time-consuming and
labor-intensive, which has motivated the adoption of deep learning methods. In
recent years, Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Vision Transformer
architectures have been widely explored for drought stress identification;
however, these models generally rely on a large number of trainable parameters,
restricting their use in resource-limited and real-time agricultural settings.
To address this challenge, we propose a novel lightweight hybrid CNN framework
inspired by ResNet, DenseNet, and MobileNet architectures. The framework
achieves a remarkable 15-fold reduction in trainable parameters compared to
conventional CNN and Vision Transformer models, while maintaining competitive
accuracy. In addition, we introduce a machine unlearning mechanism based on a
gradient norm-based influence function, which enables targeted removal of
specific training data influence, thereby improving model adaptability. The
method was evaluated on an aerial image dataset of potato fields with
expert-annotated healthy and drought-stressed regions. Experimental results
show that our framework achieves high accuracy while substantially lowering
computational costs. These findings highlight its potential as a practical,
scalable, and adaptive solution for drought stress monitoring in precision
agriculture, particularly under resource-constrained conditions.

Abstract: Brain Metastases (BM) are a large contributor to mortality of patients with
cancer. They are treated with Stereotactic Radiosurgery (SRS) and monitored
with Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) at regular follow-up intervals according
to treatment guidelines. Analyzing and quantifying this longitudinal imaging
represents an intractable workload for clinicians. As a result, follow-up
images are not annotated and merely assessed by observation. Response to
treatment in longitudinal imaging is being studied, to better understand growth
trajectories and ultimately predict treatment success or toxicity as early as
possible. In this study, we implement an automated pipeline to curate a large
longitudinal dataset of SRS treatment data, resulting in a cohort of 896 BMs in
177 patients who were monitored for >360 days at approximately two-month
intervals at Lausanne University Hospital (CHUV). We use a data-driven
clustering to identify characteristic trajectories. In addition, we predict 12
months lesion-level response using classical as well as graph machine learning
Graph Machine Learning (GML). Clustering revealed 5 dominant growth
trajectories with distinct final response categories. Response prediction
reaches up to 0.90 AUC (CI95%=0.88-0.92) using only pre-treatment and first
follow-up MRI with gradient boosting. Similarly, robust predictive performance
of up to 0.88 AUC (CI95%=0.86-0.90) was obtained using GML, offering more
flexibility with a single model for multiple input time-points configurations.
Our results suggest potential automation and increased precision for the
comprehensive assessment and prediction of BM response to SRS in longitudinal
MRI. The proposed pipeline facilitates scalable data curation for the
investigation of BM growth patterns, and lays the foundation for clinical
decision support systems aiming at optimizing personalized care.

TL;DR: 本文针对3D高斯泼溅在大型场景中的位置量化问题，提出了基于球坐标的新量化方案，以减小投影误差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3DGS在大型场景中，输入视图来自有限空间区域，重建主要适用于相同区域的6DoF视图。当相机位置自由度受限时（3DoF+），坐标量化问题会导致投影误差，需要优化量化方案。

Method: 研究位置误差对投影误差的影响，发现投影误差与投影点距离的平方倒数成正比。基于此分析，提出了一种基于球坐标的新型量化方案。

Result: 在著名的Garden场景上展示了所提方法的率失真性能，验证了量化方案的有效性。

Conclusion: 提出的球坐标量化方案能够有效处理3DGS在3DoF+场景中的位置量化问题，减小投影误差，提高重建质量。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) is a major breakthrough in 3D scene
reconstruction. With a number of views of a given object or scene, the
algorithm trains a model composed of 3D gaussians, which enables the production
of novel views from arbitrary points of view. This freedom of movement is
referred to as 6DoF for 6 degrees of freedom: a view is produced for any
position (3 degrees), orientation of camera (3 other degrees). On large scenes,
though, the input views are acquired from a limited zone in space, and the
reconstruction is valuable for novel views from the same zone, even if the
scene itself is almost unlimited in size. We refer to this particular case as
3DoF+, meaning that the 3 degrees of freedom of camera position are limited to
small offsets around the central position. Considering the problem of
coordinate quantization, the impact of position error on the projection error
in pixels is studied. It is shown that the projection error is proportional to
the squared inverse distance of the point being projected. Consequently, a new
quantization scheme based on spherical coordinates is proposed. Rate-distortion
performance of the proposed method are illustrated on the well-known Garden
scene.

Method: 使用二进制补丁级分类器移除文档图像中的非文本区域，通过最大池化精炼步骤恢复碎片化的文本区域以提升空间一致性。

Result: 在真实世界文档数据集上的实验表明，该方法显著降低了计算成本，同时保持了可比的准确性。

Abstract: Recent progress in vision-language models (VLMs) has led to impressive
results in document understanding tasks, but their high computational demands
remain a challenge. To mitigate the compute burdens, we propose a lightweight
token pruning framework that filters out non-informative background regions
from document images prior to VLM processing. A binary patch-level classifier
removes non-text areas, and a max-pooling refinement step recovers fragmented
text regions to enhance spatial coherence. Experiments on real-world document
datasets demonstrate that our approach substantially lowers computational
costs, while maintaining comparable accuracy.

*Hua Zhang,Changjiang Luo,Ruoyu Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Phantom-Insight是一种基于SAM和MLLM的视频伪装目标检测新方法，通过动态前景视觉token评分模块和解耦学习策略，解决了现有方法在目标边缘分离和前景背景区分方面的局限性，在MoCA-Mask数据集上达到SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VCOD方法存在两个主要问题：(1)SAM-based方法因模型冻结而难以分离伪装目标边缘；(2)MLLM-based方法因大语言模型合并前景背景而导致目标可分性差。

Method: 提出Phantom-Insight方法：1)使用时序和空间线索表示视频序列，通过LLM进行特征融合增加信息密度；2)通过动态前景视觉token评分模块和提示网络生成多线索，自适应引导和微调SAM模型；3)采用解耦的前景-背景学习策略，分别生成前景和背景线索进行解耦训练。

Result: 在MoCA-Mask数据集上实现了最先进的性能，在CAD2016数据集上展示了对未见伪装目标的检测能力，证明了其强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: Phantom-Insight通过结合SAM和MLLM的优势，并引入创新的特征融合和解耦学习策略，有效解决了视频伪装目标检测中的关键挑战，具有优异的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Video camouflaged object detection (VCOD) is challenging due to dynamic
environments. Existing methods face two main issues: (1) SAM-based methods
struggle to separate camouflaged object edges due to model freezing, and (2)
MLLM-based methods suffer from poor object separability as large language
models merge foreground and background. To address these issues, we propose a
novel VCOD method based on SAM and MLLM, called Phantom-Insight. To enhance the
separability of object edge details, we represent video sequences with temporal
and spatial clues and perform feature fusion via LLM to increase information
density. Next, multiple cues are generated through the dynamic foreground
visual token scoring module and the prompt network to adaptively guide and
fine-tune the SAM model, enabling it to adapt to subtle textures. To enhance
the separability of objects and background, we propose a decoupled
foreground-background learning strategy. By generating foreground and
background cues separately and performing decoupled training, the visual token
can effectively integrate foreground and background information independently,
enabling SAM to more accurately segment camouflaged objects in the video.
Experiments on the MoCA-Mask dataset show that Phantom-Insight achieves
state-of-the-art performance across various metrics. Additionally, its ability
to detect unseen camouflaged objects on the CAD2016 dataset highlights its
strong generalization ability.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Muzzle patterns are among the most effective biometric traits for cattle
identification. Fast and accurate detection of the muzzle region as the region
of interest is critical to automatic visual cattle identification.. Earlier
approaches relied on manual detection, which is labor-intensive and
inconsistent. Recently, automated methods using supervised models like YOLO
have become popular for muzzle detection. Although effective, these methods
require extensive annotated datasets and tend to be trained data-dependent,
limiting their performance on new or unseen cattle. To address these
limitations, this study proposes a zero-shot muzzle detection framework based
on Grounding DINO, a vision-language model capable of detecting muzzles without
any task-specific training or annotated data. This approach leverages natural
language prompts to guide detection, enabling scalable and flexible muzzle
localization across diverse breeds and environments. Our model achieves a mean
Average Precision (mAP)@0.5 of 76.8\%, demonstrating promising performance
without requiring annotated data. To our knowledge, this is the first research
to provide a real-world, industry-oriented, and annotation-free solution for
cattle muzzle detection. The framework offers a practical alternative to
supervised methods, promising improved adaptability and ease of deployment in
livestock monitoring applications.

Motivation: 现有超分辨率算法缺乏有效的全参考图像质量评估指标，需要开发符合人类视觉系统特性的评估方法

Method: 采用三模块结构：图像编码器、感知导向双向注意力模块（包含双向注意力、分组多尺度可变形卷积和子信息激励卷积）、质量预测模块

Result: 大量实验表明PBAN在超分辨率图像质量评估方面优于最先进的方法

Conclusion: PBAN通过双向注意力机制和感知导向设计，有效提升了超分辨率图像质量评估的准确性

Abstract: Many super-resolution (SR) algorithms have been proposed to increase image
resolution. However, full-reference (FR) image quality assessment (IQA) metrics
for comparing and evaluating different SR algorithms are limited. In this work,
we propose the Perception-oriented Bidirectional Attention Network (PBAN) for
image SR FR-IQA, which is composed of three modules: an image encoder module, a
perception-oriented bidirectional attention (PBA) module, and a quality
prediction module. First, we encode the input images for feature
representations. Inspired by the characteristics of the human visual system, we
then construct the perception-oriented PBA module. Specifically, different from
existing attention-based SR IQA methods, we conceive a Bidirectional Attention
to bidirectionally construct visual attention to distortion, which is
consistent with the generation and evaluation processes of SR images. To
further guide the quality assessment towards the perception of distorted
information, we propose Grouped Multi-scale Deformable Convolution, enabling
the proposed method to adaptively perceive distortion. Moreover, we design
Sub-information Excitation Convolution to direct visual perception to both
sub-pixel and sub-channel attention. Finally, the quality prediction module is
exploited to integrate quality-aware features and regress quality scores.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed PBAN outperforms
state-of-the-art quality assessment methods.

Motivation: 解决跨源点云注册面临的两大核心挑战：缺乏大规模真实数据集进行深度注册模型训练，以及不同传感器捕获点云的内在差异导致的特征提取和匹配困难。

Method: 构建Cross3DReg数据集（旋转机械雷达+半固态雷达），设计重叠基于的跨源注册框架，利用未对齐图像预测源与目标点云间的重叠区域，筛除无关区域的冗余点，并提出视觉-几何关注导向的匹配模块，融合图像和几何信息来建立可靠对应关系。

Conclusion: 本文提出的Cross3DReg数据集和重叠基于的跨源注册框架能够有效解决跨源点云注册的挑战，通过图像-几何信息融合显著提升了注册的准确性和稳健性。

Abstract: Cross-source point cloud registration, which aims to align point cloud data
from different sensors, is a fundamental task in 3D vision. However, compared
to the same-source point cloud registration, cross-source registration faces
two core challenges: the lack of publicly available large-scale real-world
datasets for training the deep registration models, and the inherent
differences in point clouds captured by multiple sensors. The diverse patterns
induced by the sensors pose great challenges in robust and accurate point cloud
feature extraction and matching, which negatively influence the registration
accuracy. To advance research in this field, we construct Cross3DReg, the
currently largest and real-world multi-modal cross-source point cloud
registration dataset, which is collected by a rotating mechanical lidar and a
hybrid semi-solid-state lidar, respectively. Moreover, we design an
overlap-based cross-source registration framework, which utilizes unaligned
images to predict the overlapping region between source and target point
clouds, effectively filtering out redundant points in the irrelevant regions
and significantly mitigating the interference caused by noise in
non-overlapping areas. Then, a visual-geometric attention guided matching
module is proposed to enhance the consistency of cross-source point cloud
features by fusing image and geometric information to establish reliable
correspondences and ultimately achieve accurate and robust registration.
Extensive experiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art
registration performance. Our framework reduces the relative rotation error
(RRE) and relative translation error (RTE) by $63.2\%$ and $40.2\%$,
respectively, and improves the registration recall (RR) by $5.4\%$, which
validates its effectiveness in achieving accurate cross-source registration.

Abstract: Deep neural networks currently dominate many fields of the artificial
intelligence landscape, achieving state-of-the-art results on numerous tasks
while remaining hard to understand and exhibiting surprising weaknesses. An
active area of research focuses on adversarial attacks, which aim to generate
inputs that uncover these weaknesses. However, this proves challenging,
especially in the black-box scenario where model details are inaccessible. This
paper explores in detail the impact of such adversarial algorithms on
ResNet-18, DenseNet-121, Swin Transformer V2, and Vision Transformer network
architectures. Leveraging the Tiny ImageNet, Caltech-256, and Food-101
datasets, we benchmark two novel black-box iterative adversarial algorithms
based on affine transformations and genetic algorithms: 1) Affine
Transformation Attack (ATA), an iterative algorithm maximizing our attack score
function using random affine transformations, and 2) Affine Genetic Attack
(AGA), a genetic algorithm that involves random noise and affine
transformations. We evaluate the performance of the models in the algorithm
parameter variation, data augmentation, and global and targeted attack
configurations. We also compare our algorithms with two black-box adversarial
algorithms, Pixle and Square Attack. Our experiments yield better results on
the image classification task than similar methods in the literature, achieving
an accuracy improvement of up to 8.82%. We provide noteworthy insights into
successful adversarial defenses and attacks at both global and targeted levels,
and demonstrate adversarial robustness through algorithm parameter variation.

Conclusion: 研究揭示了视觉复杂度与注意力机制的相互作用，通过对比注意力为改进视觉推理提供了高效途径

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable success across
diverse visual tasks, yet their performance degrades in complex visual
environments. While existing enhancement approaches require additional
training, rely on external segmentation tools, or operate at coarse-grained
levels, they overlook the innate ability within VLMs. To bridge this gap, we
investigate VLMs' attention patterns and discover that: (1) visual complexity
strongly correlates with attention entropy, negatively impacting reasoning
performance; (2) attention progressively refines from global scanning in
shallow layers to focused convergence in deeper layers, with convergence degree
determined by visual complexity. (3) Theoretically, we prove that the contrast
of attention maps between general queries and task-specific queries enables the
decomposition of visual signal into semantic signals and visual noise
components. Building on these insights, we propose Contrastive Attention
Refinement for Visual Enhancement (CARVE), a training-free method that extracts
task-relevant visual signals through attention contrasting at the pixel level.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that CARVE consistently enhances performance,
achieving up to 75% improvement on open-source models. Our work provides
critical insights into the interplay between visual complexity and attention
mechanisms, offering an efficient pathway for improving visual reasoning with
contrasting attention.

Abstract: Realistic and parameterized 3D models of human anatomy have become invaluable
in research, diagnostics, and surgical planning. However, the development of
detailed models for internal organs, such as the stomach, has been limited by
data availability and methodological challenges. In this paper, we propose a
novel pipeline for the generation of synthetic 3D stomach models, enabling the
creation of anatomically diverse morphologies informed by established studies
on stomach shape variability. Using this pipeline, we construct a dataset of
synthetic stomachs. Building on this dataset, we develop a 3D statistical shape
model of the stomach, trained to capture natural anatomical variability in a
low-dimensional shape space. The model is further refined using CT meshes
derived from publicly available datasets through a semi-supervised alignment
process, enhancing its ability to generalize to unseen anatomical variations.
We evaluated the model on a held-out test set of real stomach CT scans,
demonstrating robust generalization and fit accuracy. We make the statistical
shape model along with the synthetic dataset publicly available on GitLab:
https://gitlab.com/Erez.Posner/stomach_pytorch to facilitate further research.
This work introduces the first statistical 3D shape model of the stomach, with
applications ranging from surgical simulation and pre-operative planning to
medical education and computational modeling. By combining synthetic data
generation, parametric modeling, and real-world validation, our approach
represents a significant advancement in organ modeling and opens new
possibilities for personalized healthcare solutions.

Motivation: 评估大规模视觉基础模型如DINOv3在专业领域（如医学形态形式）中的效果转移能力，以确定是否可以直接作为医学视觉任务的统一编码器而无需领域特定预训练。

Abstract: The advent of large-scale vision foundation models, pre-trained on diverse
natural images, has marked a paradigm shift in computer vision. However, how
the frontier vision foundation models' efficacies transfer to specialized
domains remains such as medical imaging remains an open question. This report
investigates whether DINOv3, a state-of-the-art self-supervised vision
transformer (ViT) that features strong capability in dense prediction tasks,
can directly serve as a powerful, unified encoder for medical vision tasks
without domain-specific pre-training. To answer this, we benchmark DINOv3
across common medical vision tasks, including 2D/3D classification and
segmentation on a wide range of medical imaging modalities. We systematically
analyze its scalability by varying model sizes and input image resolutions. Our
findings reveal that DINOv3 shows impressive performance and establishes a
formidable new baseline. Remarkably, it can even outperform medical-specific
foundation models like BiomedCLIP and CT-Net on several tasks, despite being
trained solely on natural images. However, we identify clear limitations: The
model's features degrade in scenarios requiring deep domain specialization,
such as in Whole-Slide Pathological Images (WSIs), Electron Microscopy (EM),
and Positron Emission Tomography (PET). Furthermore, we observe that DINOv3
does not consistently obey scaling law in the medical domain; performance does
not reliably increase with larger models or finer feature resolutions, showing
diverse scaling behaviors across tasks. Ultimately, our work establishes DINOv3
as a strong baseline, whose powerful visual features can serve as a robust
prior for multiple complex medical tasks. This opens promising future
directions, such as leveraging its features to enforce multiview consistency in
3D reconstruction.

Motivation: 解决高分辨率遥感图像变化检测中的两个关键挑战：1）模型容易将时间偏移（如光照、季节变化）引起的辐射变化误判为真实变化；2）深层抽象特征与浅层细节特征之间存在语义鸿沟，导致边界分割不准确。

Conclusion: FSG-Net通过频域和空间域的协同处理，有效解决了变化检测中的伪变化问题和特征融合难题，为高分辨率遥感图像变化检测提供了新的有效解决方案。

Abstract: Change detection from high-resolution remote sensing images lies as a
cornerstone of Earth observation applications, yet its efficacy is often
compromised by two critical challenges. First, false alarms are prevalent as
models misinterpret radiometric variations from temporal shifts (e.g.,
illumination, season) as genuine changes. Second, a non-negligible semantic gap
between deep abstract features and shallow detail-rich features tends to
obstruct their effective fusion, culminating in poorly delineated boundaries.
To step further in addressing these issues, we propose the Frequency-Spatial
Synergistic Gated Network (FSG-Net), a novel paradigm that aims to
systematically disentangle semantic changes from nuisance variations.
Specifically, FSG-Net first operates in the frequency domain, where a
Discrepancy-Aware Wavelet Interaction Module (DAWIM) adaptively mitigates
pseudo-changes by discerningly processing different frequency components.
Subsequently, the refined features are enhanced in the spatial domain by a
Synergistic Temporal-Spatial Attention Module (STSAM), which amplifies the
saliency of genuine change regions. To finally bridge the semantic gap, a
Lightweight Gated Fusion Unit (LGFU) leverages high-level semantics to
selectively gate and integrate crucial details from shallow layers.
Comprehensive experiments on the CDD, GZ-CD, and LEVIR-CD benchmarks validate
the superiority of FSG-Net, establishing a new state-of-the-art with F1-scores
of 94.16%, 89.51%, and 91.27%, respectively. The code will be made available at

Abstract: In industrial quality control, to visually recognize unwanted items within a
moving heterogeneous stream, human operators are often still indispensable.
Waste-sorting stands as a significant example, where operators on multiple
conveyor belts manually remove unwanted objects to select specific materials.
To automate this recognition problem, computer vision systems offer great
potential in accurately identifying and segmenting unwanted items in such
settings. Unfortunately, considering the multitude and the variety of sorting
tasks, fully supervised approaches are not a viable option to address this
challange, as they require extensive labeling efforts. Surprisingly, weakly
supervised alternatives that leverage the implicit supervision naturally
provided by the operator in his removal action are relatively unexplored. In
this paper, we define the concept of Before-After Supervision, illustrating how
to train a segmentation network by leveraging only the visual differences
between images acquired \textit{before} and \textit{after} the operator. To
promote research in this direction, we introduce WS$^2$ (Weakly Supervised
segmentation for Waste-Sorting), the first multiview dataset consisting of more
than 11 000 high-resolution video frames captured on top of a conveyor belt,
including "before" and "after" images. We also present a robust end-to-end
pipeline, used to benchmark several state-of-the-art weakly supervised
segmentation methods on WS$^2$.

Abstract: Subject-driven image generation (SDIG) aims to manipulate specific subjects
within images while adhering to textual instructions, a task crucial for
advancing text-to-image diffusion models. SDIG requires reconciling the tension
between maintaining subject identity and complying with dynamic edit
instructions, a challenge inadequately addressed by existing methods. In this
paper, we introduce the Target-Instructed Diffusion Enhancing (TIDE) framework,
which resolves this tension through target supervision and preference learning
without test-time fine-tuning. TIDE pioneers target-supervised triplet
alignment, modelling subject adaptation dynamics using a (reference image,
instruction, target images) triplet. This approach leverages the Direct Subject
Diffusion (DSD) objective, training the model with paired "winning" (balanced
preservation-compliance) and "losing" (distorted) targets, systematically
generated and evaluated via quantitative metrics. This enables implicit reward
modelling for optimal preservation-compliance balance. Experimental results on
standard benchmarks demonstrate TIDE's superior performance in generating
subject-faithful outputs while maintaining instruction compliance,
outperforming baseline methods across multiple quantitative metrics. TIDE's
versatility is further evidenced by its successful application to diverse
tasks, including structural-conditioned generation, image-to-image generation,
and text-image interpolation. Our code is available at

Method: 重现Luo等人的实验设置，发现原始实现与描述不一致后提出A-FairCLIP重新实现，并提出FairCLIP+扩展到多属性情况。在Harvard-FairVLMed数据集上进行零样本青光眼分类测试。

Result: 识别到CLIP存在对某些人口统计组的偏见，但FairCLIP的正式实现和A-FairCLIP都未能提高性能或公平性。虽然正则化目标减小了Sinkhorn距离，但在两个数据集上的实验结果并不支持原始方法的效果断言。

Conclusion: 该研究对FairCLIP方法的可重现性提出质疑，虽然识别了CLIP的偏见问题，但FairCLIP的实际效果并未能证实其能够有效改善模型的公平性和性能。

Abstract: We investigated the reproducibility of FairCLIP, proposed by Luo et al.
(2024), for improving the group fairness of CLIP (Radford et al., 2021) by
minimizing image-text similarity score disparities across sensitive groups
using the Sinkhorn distance. The experimental setup of Luo et al. (2024) was
reproduced to primarily investigate the research findings for FairCLIP. The
model description by Luo et al. (2024) was found to differ from the original
implementation. Therefore, a new implementation, A-FairCLIP, is introduced to
examine specific design choices. Furthermore, FairCLIP+ is proposed to extend
the FairCLIP objective to include multiple attributes. Additionally, the impact
of the distance minimization on FairCLIP's fairness and performance was
explored. In alignment with the original authors, CLIP was found to be biased
towards certain demographics when applied to zero-shot glaucoma classification
using medical scans and clinical notes from the Harvard-FairVLMed dataset.
However, the experimental results on two datasets do not support their claim
that FairCLIP improves the performance and fairness of CLIP. Although the
regularization objective reduces Sinkhorn distances, both the official
implementation and the aligned implementation, A-FairCLIP, were not found to
improve performance nor fairness in zero-shot glaucoma classification.

Conclusion: 将学习到的图像表示与领域特定的放射组学特征相结合，为神经肿瘤学中的自动化治疗反应评估提供了强大而有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate evaluation of the response of glioblastoma to therapy is crucial for
clinical decision-making and patient management. The Response Assessment in
Neuro-Oncology (RANO) criteria provide a standardized framework to assess
patients' clinical response, but their application can be complex and subject
to observer variability. This paper presents an automated method for
classifying the intervention response from longitudinal MRI scans, developed to
predict tumor response during therapy as part of the BraTS 2025 challenge. We
propose a novel hybrid framework that combines deep learning derived feature
extraction and an extensive set of radiomics and clinically chosen features.
Our approach utilizes a fine-tuned ResNet-18 model to extract features from 2D
regions of interest across four MRI modalities. These deep features are then
fused with a rich set of more than 4800 radiomic and clinically driven
features, including 3D radiomics of tumor growth and shrinkage masks,
volumetric changes relative to the nadir, and tumor centroid shift. Using the
fused feature set, a CatBoost classifier achieves a mean ROC AUC of 0.81 and a
Macro F1 score of 0.50 in the 4-class response prediction task (Complete
Response, Partial Response, Stable Disease, Progressive Disease). Our results
highlight that synergizing learned image representations with domain-targeted
radiomic features provides a robust and effective solution for automated
treatment response assessment in neuro-oncology.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文介绍了FMOX数据集，为快速移动物体(FMO)图像序列提供JSON格式的元数据和尺寸信息，并测试了EfficientTAM模型在FMO跟踪任务上的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 快速微小物体跟踪在计算机视觉中仍具挑战性，需要标准化的数据集格式和评估方法来促进该领域的发展。

Method: 创建FMOX JSON元数据文件扩展四个开源FMO数据集，包含物体尺寸信息；使用Trajectory IoU指标评估EfficientTAM模型性能。

Result: EfficientTAM模型在FMOX数据集上的表现与专门为FMO设计的原有方法相当，证明了其作为基础跟踪模型的有效性。

Conclusion: FMOX提供了标准化的数据集格式，使FMO数据集更易于访问和使用，为机器学习管道处理FMO数据提供了便利。

Abstract: Fast and tiny object tracking remains a challenge in computer vision and in
this paper we first introduce a JSON metadata file associated with four open
source datasets of Fast Moving Objects (FMOs) image sequences. In addition, we
extend the description of the FMOs datasets with additional ground truth
information in JSON format (called FMOX) with object size information. Finally
we use our FMOX file to test a recently proposed foundational model for
tracking (called EfficientTAM) showing that its performance compares well with
the pipelines originally taylored for these FMO datasets. Our comparison of
these state-of-the-art techniques on FMOX is provided with Trajectory
Intersection of Union (TIoU) scores. The code and JSON is shared open source
allowing FMOX to be accessible and usable for other machine learning pipelines
aiming to process FMO datasets.

*Emil Demić,Luka Čehovin Zajc*

TL;DR: 通过重新设计训练目标和方法，提出了一种更简单但更有效的场景级素描基于图像检索方法，具有更好的突出器性能和识别准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法在处理自由手绘索结的未知性和噪声时的不足，强调索结的未知性和噪声问题。

Method: 重新设计训练目标，采用适当的预训练、编码器结构和损失函数组合，以提高对索结变化的健壮性。

Result: 在FS-COCO和SketchyCOCO数据集上达到了最先进的性能，无需增加额外复杂性。

Conclusion: 训练设计在跨模态检索任务中具有关键作用，同时需要改进场景级SBIR的评估场景。

Abstract: The goal of Scene-level Sketch-Based Image Retrieval is to retrieve natural
images matching the overall semantics and spatial layout of a free-hand sketch.
Unlike prior work focused on architectural augmentations of retrieval models,
we emphasize the inherent ambiguity and noise present in real-world sketches.
This insight motivates a training objective that is explicitly designed to be
robust to sketch variability. We show that with an appropriate combination of
pre-training, encoder architecture, and loss formulation, it is possible to
achieve state-of-the-art performance without the introduction of additional
complexity. Extensive experiments on a challenging FS-COCO and widely-used
SketchyCOCO datasets confirm the effectiveness of our approach and underline
the critical role of training design in cross-modal retrieval tasks, as well as
the need to improve the evaluation scenarios of scene-level SBIR.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出RARL方法解决增量开放集识别问题，通过角度空间表示学习和虚拟-本征交互训练策略，在CIFAR100和TinyImageNet上达到SOTA性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有开放集识别方法主要针对静态场景，无法有效处理连续数据流中不断出现的新未知类别，导致决策边界判别性难以维持和严重的类间混淆

Method: RARL方法：1）在等角紧框架构建的角度空间中，将未知表示对齐到非活跃原型周围；2）采用虚拟-本征交互训练策略，通过边界邻近虚拟类增强类间间隔；3）设计分层校正策略优化决策边界

Result: 在CIFAR100和TinyImageNet数据集上建立了IOSR新基准，在各种任务设置下均实现了最先进的性能

Conclusion: RARL方法有效解决了增量开放集识别中的表示漂移和决策边界退化问题，为动态环境下的未知类别识别提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Existing open set recognition (OSR) methods are typically designed for static
scenarios, where models aim to classify known classes and identify unknown ones
within fixed scopes. This deviates from the expectation that the model should
incrementally identify newly emerging unknown classes from continuous data
streams and acquire corresponding knowledge. In such evolving scenarios, the
discriminability of OSR decision boundaries is hard to maintain due to
restricted access to former training data, causing severe inter-class
confusion. To solve this problem, we propose retentive angular representation
learning (RARL) for incremental open set recognition (IOSR). In RARL, unknown
representations are encouraged to align around inactive prototypes within an
angular space constructed under the equiangular tight frame, thereby mitigating
excessive representation drift during knowledge updates. Specifically, we adopt
a virtual-intrinsic interactive (VII) training strategy, which compacts known
representations by enforcing clear inter-class margins through
boundary-proximal virtual classes. Furthermore, a stratified rectification
strategy is designed to refine decision boundaries, mitigating representation
bias and feature space distortion caused by imbalances between old/new and
positive/negative class samples. We conduct thorough evaluations on CIFAR100
and TinyImageNet datasets and establish a new benchmark for IOSR. Experimental
results across various task setups demonstrate that the proposed method
achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Plants in their natural habitats endure an array of interacting stresses,
both biotic and abiotic, that rarely occur in isolation. Nutrient
stress-particularly nitrogen deficiency-becomes even more critical when
compounded with drought and weed competition, making it increasingly difficult
to distinguish and address its effects. Early detection of nitrogen stress is
therefore crucial for protecting plant health and implementing effective
management strategies. This study proposes a novel deep learning framework to
accurately classify nitrogen stress severity in a combined stress environment.
Our model uses a unique blend of four imaging modalities-RGB, multispectral,
and two infrared wavelengths-to capture a wide range of physiological plant
responses from canopy images. These images, provided as time-series data,
document plant health across three levels of nitrogen availability (low,
medium, and high) under varying water stress and weed pressures. The core of
our approach is a spatio-temporal deep learning pipeline that merges a
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for extracting spatial features from images
with a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network to capture temporal dependencies.
We also devised and evaluated a spatial-only CNN pipeline for comparison. Our
CNN-LSTM pipeline achieved an impressive accuracy of 98%, impressively
surpassing the spatial-only model's 80.45% and other previously reported
machine learning method's 76%. These results bring actionable insights based on
the power of our CNN-LSTM approach in effectively capturing the subtle and
complex interactions between nitrogen deficiency, water stress, and weed
pressure. This robust platform offers a promising tool for the timely and
proactive identification of nitrogen stress severity, enabling better crop
management and improved plant health.

### [127] [Approximating Condorcet Ordering for Vector-valued Mathematical Morphology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06577)
*Marcos Eduardo Valle,Santiago Velasco-Forero,Joao Batista Florindo,Gustavo Jesus Angulo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种机器学习方法，通过学习近似Condorcet排序的简化排序来解决矢量图像数学形态学中矢量排序的共识问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数学形态学在矢量值图像（如彩色和高光谱图像）处理中缺乏统一的矢量排序方法，需要找到最合适的排序方式来构建形态学算子

Method: 采用机器学习方法学习近似Condorcet排序的简化排序，Condorcet排序基于投票问题思想，通过多个不同排序的投票结果来排名元素

Result: 初步计算实验证实了学习简化映射在定义彩色图像矢量值形态学算子方面的有效性

Conclusion: 该方法为解决矢量排序问题提供了有效的机器学习解决方案，能够成功应用于彩色图像的形态学处理

Abstract: Mathematical morphology provides a nonlinear framework for image and spatial
data processing and analysis. Although there have been many successful
applications of mathematical morphology to vector-valued images, such as color
and hyperspectral images, there is still no consensus on the most suitable
vector ordering for constructing morphological operators. This paper addresses
this issue by examining a reduced ordering approximating the Condorcet ranking
derived from a set of vector orderings. Inspired by voting problems, the
Condorcet ordering ranks elements from most to least voted, with voters
representing different orderings. In this paper, we develop a machine learning
approach that learns a reduced ordering that approximates the Condorcet
ordering. Preliminary computational experiments confirm the effectiveness of
learning the reduced mapping to define vector-valued morphological operators
for color images.

### [128] [CausNVS: Autoregressive Multi-view Diffusion for Flexible 3D Novel View Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06579)
*Xin Kong,Daniel Watson,Yannick Strümpler,Michael Niemeyer,Federico Tombari*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CausNVS是一个自回归多视图扩散模型，通过因果掩码和逐帧噪声训练，支持任意输入输出视图配置和顺序生成，解决了传统非自回归方法视图数量固定和推理速度慢的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多视图扩散模型大多采用非自回归形式，限制了其在世界建模中的应用，因为只能支持固定数量的视图，并且由于同时去噪所有帧而导致推理速度慢。

Method: 使用因果掩码和逐帧噪声训练，采用成对相对相机位姿编码(CaPE)实现精确相机控制。推理时结合空间感知滑动窗口、键值缓存和噪声条件增强来减轻漂移。

Result: 实验表明CausNVS支持广泛的相机轨迹，实现灵活的自回归新视图合成，并在多样化设置下保持一致的强视觉质量。

Conclusion: CausNVS通过自回归方法成功解决了多视图扩散模型在视图数量限制和推理效率方面的问题，为3D新视图合成提供了更灵活高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-view diffusion models have shown promise in 3D novel view synthesis,
but most existing methods adopt a non-autoregressive formulation. This limits
their applicability in world modeling, as they only support a fixed number of
views and suffer from slow inference due to denoising all frames
simultaneously. To address these limitations, we propose CausNVS, a multi-view
diffusion model in an autoregressive setting, which supports arbitrary
input-output view configurations and generates views sequentially. We train
CausNVS with causal masking and per-frame noise, using pairwise-relative camera
pose encodings (CaPE) for precise camera control. At inference time, we combine
a spatially-aware sliding-window with key-value caching and noise conditioning
augmentation to mitigate drift. Our experiments demonstrate that CausNVS
supports a broad range of camera trajectories, enables flexible autoregressive
novel view synthesis, and achieves consistently strong visual quality across
diverse settings. Project page: https://kxhit.github.io/CausNVS.html.

Conclusion: BioLite U-Net在分割准确性、效率和部署性方面都优于MobileNet基准模型，适合用于智能闭环生物打印系统。

Abstract: Bioprinting is a rapidly advancing field that offers a transformative
approach to fabricating tissue and organ models through the precise deposition
of cell-laden bioinks. Ensuring the fidelity and consistency of printed
structures in real-time remains a core challenge, particularly under
constraints imposed by limited imaging data and resource-constrained embedded
hardware. Semantic segmentation of the extrusion process, differentiating
between nozzle, extruded bioink, and surrounding background, enables in situ
monitoring critical to maintaining print quality and biological viability. In
this work, we introduce a lightweight semantic segmentation framework tailored
for real-time bioprinting applications. We present a novel, manually annotated
dataset comprising 787 RGB images captured during the bioprinting process,
labeled across three classes: nozzle, bioink, and background. To achieve fast
and efficient inference suitable for integration with bioprinting systems, we
propose a BioLite U-Net architecture that leverages depthwise separable
convolutions to drastically reduce computational load without compromising
accuracy. Our model is benchmarked against MobileNetV2 and MobileNetV3-based
segmentation baselines using mean Intersection over Union (mIoU), Dice score,
and pixel accuracy. All models were evaluated on a Raspberry Pi 4B to assess
real-world feasibility. The proposed BioLite U-Net achieves an mIoU of 92.85%
and a Dice score of 96.17%, while being over 1300x smaller than
MobileNetV2-DeepLabV3+. On-device inference takes 335 ms per frame,
demonstrating near real-time capability. Compared to MobileNet baselines,
BioLite U-Net offers a superior tradeoff between segmentation accuracy,
efficiency, and deployability, making it highly suitable for intelligent,
closed-loop bioprinting systems.

Abstract: Unsustainable trade in wildlife is a major threat to biodiversity and is now
increasingly prevalent in digital marketplaces and social media. With the sheer
volume of digital content, the need for automated methods to detect wildlife
trade listings is growing. These methods are especially needed for the
automatic identification of wildlife products, such as ivory. We developed
machine learning-based object recognition models that can identify wildlife
products within images and highlight them. The data consists of images of
elephant, pangolin, and tiger products that were identified as being sold
illegally or that were confiscated by authorities. Specifically, the wildlife
products included elephant ivory and skins, pangolin scales, and claws (raw and
crafted), and tiger skins and bones. We investigated various combinations of
training strategies and two loss functions to identify the best model to use in
the automatic detection of these wildlife products. Models were trained for
each species while also developing a single model to identify products from all
three species. The best model showed an overall accuracy of 84.2% with
accuracies of 71.1%, 90.2% and 93.5% in detecting products derived from
elephants, pangolins, and tigers, respectively. We further demonstrate that the
machine learning model can be made easily available to stakeholders, such as
government authorities and law enforcement agencies, by developing a
smartphone-based application that had an overall accuracy of 91.3%. The
application can be used in real time to click images and help identify
potentially prohibited products of target species. Thus, the proposed method is
not only applicable for monitoring trade on the web but can also be used e.g.
in physical markets for monitoring wildlife trade.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低剂量CT和PET虽然减少辐射暴露，但会导致噪声和伪影增加，影响诊断准确性，需要有效的去噪方法

Method: 提出混合Swin注意力网络(HSANet)，包含高效全局注意力(EGA)模块增强空间和通道交互，以及混合上采样模块防止噪声过拟合

Result: 在公开LDCT/PET数据集上实验表明，HSANet相比现有方法具有更优的去噪性能，同时保持轻量级模型大小，适合标准GPU部署

Conclusion: HSANet方法在保持辐射安全的同时显著提升图像质量，具有实际临床应用价值

Abstract: Low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) and positron emission tomography (PET)
have emerged as safer alternatives to conventional imaging modalities by
significantly reducing radiation exposure. However, this reduction often
results in increased noise and artifacts, which can compromise diagnostic
accuracy. Consequently, denoising for LDCT/PET has become a vital area of
research aimed at enhancing image quality while maintaining radiation safety.
In this study, we introduce a novel Hybrid Swin Attention Network (HSANet),
which incorporates Efficient Global Attention (EGA) modules and a hybrid
upsampling module. The EGA modules enhance both spatial and channel-wise
interaction, improving the network's capacity to capture relevant features,
while the hybrid upsampling module mitigates the risk of overfitting to noise.
We validate the proposed approach using a publicly available LDCT/PET dataset.
Experimental results demonstrate that HSANet achieves superior denoising
performance compared to existing methods, while maintaining a lightweight model
size suitable for deployment on GPUs with standard memory configurations. This
makes our approach highly practical for real-world clinical applications.

Abstract: Brain tumors are serious health problems that require early diagnosis due to
their high mortality rates. Diagnosing tumors by examining Magnetic Resonance
Imaging (MRI) images is a process that requires expertise and is prone to
error. Therefore, the need for automated diagnosis systems is increasing day by
day. In this context, a robust and explainable Deep Learning (DL) model for the
classification of brain tumors is proposed. In this study, a publicly available
Figshare dataset containing 3,064 T1-weighted contrast-enhanced brain MRI
images of three tumor types was used. First, the classification performance of
nine well-known CNN architectures was evaluated to determine the most effective
backbone. Among these, EfficientNetV2 demonstrated the best performance and was
selected as the backbone for further development. Subsequently, an
attention-based MLP-Mixer architecture was integrated into EfficientNetV2 to
enhance its classification capability. The performance of the final model was
comprehensively compared with basic CNNs and the methods in the literature.
Additionally, Grad-CAM visualization was used to interpret and validate the
decision-making process of the proposed model. The proposed model's performance
was evaluated using the five-fold cross-validation method. The proposed model
demonstrated superior performance with 99.50% accuracy, 99.47% precision,
99.52% recall and 99.49% F1 score. The results obtained show that the model
outperforms the studies in the literature. Moreover, Grad-CAM visualizations
demonstrate that the model effectively focuses on relevant regions of MRI
images, thus improving interpretability and clinical reliability. A robust deep
learning model for clinical decision support systems has been obtained by
combining EfficientNetV2 and attention-based MLP-Mixer, providing high accuracy
and interpretability in brain tumor classification.

TL;DR: 本文研究位置基正则化在海底图像自监督学习中的效果，在三个数据集上评估了6种SOTA SSL框架，发现位置正则化能持续提升分类性能，特别是在低维隐藏表征中效果显著。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高速量解释机器人收集的海底视觉图像可以提高海洋监测和探索的效率。虽然最近的研究建议位置元数据可以增强自监督学习特征学习，但其在不同SSL策略、模型和海底图像数据集上的好处待探索。

Method: 评估位置基正则化对6种最先进的SSL框架的影响，包括卷积神经网络(CNN)和视觉Transformer(ViT)模型，具有不同的隐藏空间维度。在三个多样化的海底图像数据集上进行评估。

Result: 位置正则化持续改善下游分类性能：CNN平均F1分数提升4.9±4.0%，ViT提升6.3±8.9%。位置正则化SSL在高低维隐藏表征上分别比预训练模型提升2.7±2.7%和10.1±9.4%。ViT预训练模型显示强大的沿众性，F1分数达到0.795±0.075。

Conclusion: 研究结果强调了位置元数据对SSL正则化的价值，特别是在使用低维隐藏表征时效果显著。同时证明了高维ViT模型在海底图像分析中的强大沿众性能力。

Abstract: High-throughput interpretation of robotically gathered seafloor visual
imagery can increase the efficiency of marine monitoring and exploration.
Although recent research has suggested that location metadata can enhance
self-supervised feature learning (SSL), its benefits across different SSL
strategies, models and seafloor image datasets are underexplored. This study
evaluates the impact of location-based regularisation on six state-of-the-art
SSL frameworks, which include Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Vision
Transformer (ViT) models with varying latent-space dimensionality. Evaluation
across three diverse seafloor image datasets finds that location-regularisation
consistently improves downstream classification performance over standard SSL,
with average F1-score gains of $4.9 \pm 4.0%$ for CNNs and $6.3 \pm 8.9%$ for
ViTs, respectively. While CNNs pretrained on generic datasets benefit from
high-dimensional latent representations, dataset-optimised SSL achieves similar
performance across the high (512) and low (128) dimensional latent
representations. Location-regularised SSL improves CNN performance over
pre-trained models by $2.7 \pm 2.7%$ and $10.1 \pm 9.4%$ for high and
low-dimensional latent representations, respectively. For ViTs,
high-dimensionality benefits both pre-trained and dataset-optimised SSL.
Although location-regularisation improves SSL performance compared to standard
SSL methods, pre-trained ViTs show strong generalisation, matching the
best-performing location-regularised SSL with F1-scores of $0.795 \pm 0.075$
and $0.795 \pm 0.077$, respectively. The findings highlight the value of
location metadata for SSL regularisation, particularly when using
low-dimensional latent representations, and demonstrate strong generalisation
of high-dimensional ViTs for seafloor image analysis.

Conclusion: OCF框架具有优秀的聚类能力和稳健性，适合用于长期持续自主海洋探索中的数据摘要生成和信息路径规划

Abstract: As long-endurance and seafloor-resident AUVs become more capable, there is an
increasing need for extended, real-time interpretation of seafloor imagery to
enable adaptive missions and optimise communication efficiency. Although
offline image analysis methods are well established, they rely on access to
complete datasets and human-labelled examples to manage the strong influence of
environmental and operational conditions on seafloor image
appearance-requirements that cannot be met in real-time settings. To address
this, we introduce an online clustering framework (OCF) capable of interpreting
seafloor imagery without supervision, which is designed to operate in real-time
on continuous data streams in a scalable, adaptive, and self-consistent manner.
The method enables the efficient review and consolidation of common patterns
across the entire data history in constant time by identifying and maintaining
a set of representative samples that capture the evolving feature distribution,
supporting dynamic cluster merging and splitting without reprocessing the full
image history. We evaluate the framework on three diverse seafloor image
datasets, analysing the impact of different representative sampling strategies
on both clustering accuracy and computational cost. The OCF achieves the
highest average F1 score of 0.68 across the three datasets among all
comparative online clustering approaches, with a standard deviation of 3%
across three distinct survey trajectories, demonstrating its superior
clustering capability and robustness to trajectory variation. In addition, it
maintains consistently lower and bounded computational time as the data volume
increases. These properties are beneficial for generating survey data summaries
and supporting informative path planning in long-term, persistent autonomous
marine exploration.

Conclusion: 该方法成功解决了大场景中单目图像深度估计的挑战，为高斯溅射提供了高质量的深度输入，实现了优秀的新视角合成效果

Abstract: VIM-GS is a Gaussian Splatting (GS) framework using monocular images for
novel-view synthesis (NVS) in large scenes. GS typically requires accurate
depth to initiate Gaussian ellipsoids using RGB-D/stereo cameras. Their limited
depth sensing range makes it difficult for GS to work in large scenes.
Monocular images, however, lack depth to guide the learning and lead to
inferior NVS results. Although large foundation models (LFMs) for monocular
depth estimation are available, they suffer from cross-frame inconsistency,
inaccuracy for distant scenes, and ambiguity in deceptive texture cues. This
paper aims to generate dense, accurate depth images from monocular RGB inputs
for high-definite GS rendering. The key idea is to leverage the accurate but
sparse depth from visual-inertial Structure-from-Motion (SfM) to refine the
dense but coarse depth from LFMs. To bridge the sparse input and dense output,
we propose an object-segmented depth propagation algorithm that renders the
depth of pixels of structured objects. Then we develop a dynamic depth
refinement module to handle the crippled SfM depth of dynamic objects and
refine the coarse LFM depth. Experiments using public and customized datasets
demonstrate the superior rendering quality of VIM-GS in large scenes.

Abstract: Assessing the severity of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) using the Total Sharp/Van
Der Heijde Score (TSS) is crucial, but manual scoring is often time-consuming
and subjective. This study introduces an Automated Radiographic Sharp Scoring
(ARTSS) framework that leverages deep learning to analyze full-hand X-ray
images, aiming to reduce inter- and intra-observer variability. The research
uniquely accommodates patients with joint disappearance and variable-length
image sequences. We developed ARTSS using data from 970 patients, structured
into four stages: I) Image pre-processing and re-orientation using ResNet50,
II) Hand segmentation using UNet.3, III) Joint identification using YOLOv7, and
IV) TSS prediction using models such as VGG16, VGG19, ResNet50, DenseNet201,
EfficientNetB0, and Vision Transformer (ViT). We evaluated model performance
with Intersection over Union (IoU), Mean Average Precision (MAP), mean absolute
error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and Huber loss. The average TSS
from two radiologists was used as the ground truth. Model training employed
3-fold cross-validation, with each fold consisting of 452 training and 227
validation samples, and external testing included 291 unseen subjects. Our
joint identification model achieved 99% accuracy. The best-performing model,
ViT, achieved a notably low Huber loss of 0.87 for TSS prediction. Our results
demonstrate the potential of deep learning to automate RA scoring, which can
significantly enhance clinical practice. Our approach addresses the challenge
of joint disappearance and variable joint numbers, offers timesaving benefits,
reduces inter- and intra-reader variability, improves radiologist accuracy, and
aids rheumatologists in making more informed decisions.

Conclusion: STAGE通过创新的异常推理策略、分级扩散框架和显式掩码对齐，成功解决了工业异常合成中的关键挑战，为下游异常分割任务提供了高质量的合成数据支持。

Abstract: Segmentation-oriented Industrial Anomaly Synthesis (SIAS) plays a pivotal
role in enhancing the performance of downstream anomaly segmentation, as it
provides an effective means of expanding abnormal data. However, existing SIAS
methods face several critical limitations: (i) the synthesized anomalies often
lack intricate texture details and fail to align precisely with the surrounding
background, and (ii) they struggle to generate fine-grained, pixel-level
anomalies. To address these challenges, we propose Segmentation-oriented
Anomaly synthesis via Graded diffusion with Explicit mask alignment, termed
STAGE. STAGE introduces a novel anomaly inference strategy that incorporates
clean background information as a prior to guide the denoising distribution,
enabling the model to more effectively distinguish and highlight abnormal
foregrounds. Furthermore, it employs a graded diffusion framework with an
anomaly-only branch to explicitly record local anomalies during both the
forward and reverse processes, ensuring that subtle anomalies are not
overlooked. Finally, STAGE incorporates the explicit mask alignment (EMA)
strategy to progressively align the synthesized anomalies with the background,
resulting in context-consistent and structurally coherent generations.
Extensive experiments on the MVTec and BTAD datasets demonstrate that STAGE
achieves state-of-the-art performance in SIAS, which in turn enhances
downstream anomaly segmentation.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is a critical task in clinical workflows,
particularly for the detection and delineation of pathological regions. While
convolutional architectures like U-Net have become standard for such tasks,
their limited receptive field restricts global context modeling. Recent efforts
integrating transformers have addressed this, but often result in deep,
computationally expensive models unsuitable for real-time use. In this work, we
present a novel end-to-end lightweight architecture designed specifically for
real-time binary medical image segmentation. Our model combines a Swin
Transformer-like encoder with a U-Net-like decoder, connected via skip pathways
to preserve spatial detail while capturing contextual information. Unlike
existing designs such as Swin Transformer or U-Net, our architecture is
significantly shallower and competitively efficient. To improve the encoder's
ability to learn meaningful features without relying on large amounts of
labeled data, we first train it using Barlow Twins, a self-supervised learning
method that helps the model focus on important patterns by reducing unnecessary
repetition in the learned features. After this pretraining, we fine-tune the
entire model for our specific task. Experiments on benchmark binary
segmentation tasks demonstrate that our model achieves competitive accuracy
with substantially reduced parameter count and faster inference, positioning it
as a practical alternative for deployment in real-time and resource-limited
clinical environments. The code for our method is available at Github

Abstract: Recent advancements in image customization exhibit a wide range of
application prospects due to stronger customization capabilities. However,
since we humans are more sensitive to faces, a significant challenge remains in
preserving consistent identity while avoiding identity confusion with
multi-reference images, limiting the identity scalability of customization
models. To address this, we present UMO, a Unified Multi-identity Optimization
framework, designed to maintain high-fidelity identity preservation and
alleviate identity confusion with scalability. With "multi-to-multi matching"
paradigm, UMO reformulates multi-identity generation as a global assignment
optimization problem and unleashes multi-identity consistency for existing
image customization methods generally through reinforcement learning on
diffusion models. To facilitate the training of UMO, we develop a scalable
customization dataset with multi-reference images, consisting of both
synthesised and real parts. Additionally, we propose a new metric to measure
identity confusion. Extensive experiments demonstrate that UMO not only
improves identity consistency significantly, but also reduces identity
confusion on several image customization methods, setting a new
state-of-the-art among open-source methods along the dimension of identity
preserving. Code and model: https://github.com/bytedance/UMO

Abstract: The rapid growth of visual content consumption across platforms necessitates
automated video classification for age-suitability standards like the MPAA

Bahdanau attention mechanism, achieving state-of-the-art performance in the
Contextual Contrastive Learning framework, with 88% accuracy and an F1 score of

TL;DR: Zo3T是一个零样本测试时训练框架，通过3D感知运动投影、轨迹引导的LoRA适配器和引导场校正，实现了高质量的轨迹引导图像到视频生成，无需大量标注数据和微调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有轨迹引导I2V生成方法需要大量计算资源进行微调，以及零样本方法忽略3D视角导致运动不真实和潜在空间与噪声预测不对齐的问题。

Method: 提出三个核心创新：3D感知运动投影推断场景深度；轨迹引导测试时LoRA动态注入适配器；引导场校正通过前瞻策略优化条件引导场。

Result: Zo3T显著提升了3D真实感和运动准确性，在轨迹控制的I2V生成中优于现有的基于训练和零样本方法。

Conclusion: Zo3T框架通过测试时训练和三个创新组件，有效解决了轨迹引导视频生成中的3D真实性和运动准确性问题，为无需大量标注数据的视频生成提供了新思路。

Abstract: Trajectory-Guided image-to-video (I2V) generation aims to synthesize videos
that adhere to user-specified motion instructions. Existing methods typically
rely on computationally expensive fine-tuning on scarce annotated datasets.
Although some zero-shot methods attempt to trajectory control in the latent
space, they may yield unrealistic motion by neglecting 3D perspective and
creating a misalignment between the manipulated latents and the network's noise
predictions. To address these challenges, we introduce Zo3T, a novel zero-shot
test-time-training framework for trajectory-guided generation with three core
innovations: First, we incorporate a 3D-Aware Kinematic Projection, leveraging
inferring scene depth to derive perspective-correct affine transformations for
target regions. Second, we introduce Trajectory-Guided Test-Time LoRA, a
mechanism that dynamically injects and optimizes ephemeral LoRA adapters into
the denoising network alongside the latent state. Driven by a regional feature
consistency loss, this co-adaptation effectively enforces motion constraints
while allowing the pre-trained model to locally adapt its internal
representations to the manipulated latent, thereby ensuring generative fidelity
and on-manifold adherence. Finally, we develop Guidance Field Rectification,
which refines the denoising evolutionary path by optimizing the conditional
guidance field through a one-step lookahead strategy, ensuring efficient
generative progression towards the target trajectory. Zo3T significantly
enhances 3D realism and motion accuracy in trajectory-controlled I2V
generation, demonstrating superior performance over existing training-based and
zero-shot approaches.

TL;DR: Curia是一个基于130TB真实世界医疗影像数据训练的基础模型，在19个放射学任务上表现优异，达到或超过放射科医生水平，并展现出跨模态和低数据场景的涌现能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI辅助放射学诊断主要依赖单一任务的窄模型，无法覆盖广泛的成像模态、疾病和放射学发现。基础模型在放射学领域的潜力尚未充分实现。

Method: 使用一家大型医院数年的全部横断面成像输出数据（15万次检查，130TB）训练Curia基础模型，并在新构建的19任务外部验证基准上进行评估。

Result: Curia能够准确识别器官、检测脑出血和心肌梗死等病症、预测肿瘤分期结果，在跨模态和低数据场景下展现出临床显著的涌现特性。

Conclusion: Curia证明了基础模型在放射学领域的巨大潜力，为推进该领域发展，作者在Hugging Face上发布了模型权重。

Abstract: AI-assisted radiological interpretation is based on predominantly narrow,
single-task models. This approach is impractical for covering the vast spectrum
of imaging modalities, diseases, and radiological findings. Foundation models
(FMs) hold the promise of broad generalization across modalities and in
low-data settings. However, this potential has remained largely unrealized in
radiology. We introduce Curia, a foundation model trained on the entire
cross-sectional imaging output of a major hospital over several years, which to
our knowledge is the largest such corpus of real-world data-encompassing
150,000 exams (130 TB). On a newly curated 19-task external validation
benchmark, Curia accurately identifies organs, detects conditions like brain
hemorrhages and myocardial infarctions, and predicts outcomes in tumor staging.
Curia meets or surpasses the performance of radiologists and recent foundation
models, and exhibits clinically significant emergent properties in
cross-modality, and low-data regimes. To accelerate progress, we release our
base model's weights at https://huggingface.co/raidium/curia.

Motivation: 现有研究分别处理组织语义分割和细胞核实例分割，忽略了这两个任务之间的内在联系，导致组织病理学理解不足

Method: 提出协同分割框架，包括区域感知提示编码器(RP-Encoder)提供高质量语义和实例区域提示，以及互提示掩码解码器(MP-Decoder)通过交叉引导增强两个任务的上下文一致性

Result: 在PUMA数据集上的大量实验表明，Co-Seg在肿瘤组织和细胞核实例的语义、实例和全景分割方面均优于现有最先进方法

Conclusion: Co-Seg框架通过协同组织分割和细胞核分割任务，有效提升了组织病理学图像分析性能，证明了任务间相互增强的重要性

Abstract: Histopathology image analysis is critical yet challenged by the demand of
segmenting tissue regions and nuclei instances for tumor microenvironment and
cellular morphology analysis. Existing studies focused on tissue semantic
segmentation or nuclei instance segmentation separately, but ignored the
inherent relationship between these two tasks, resulting in insufficient
histopathology understanding. To address this issue, we propose a Co-Seg
framework for collaborative tissue and nuclei segmentation. Specifically, we
introduce a novel co-segmentation paradigm, allowing tissue and nuclei
segmentation tasks to mutually enhance each other. To this end, we first devise
a region-aware prompt encoder (RP-Encoder) to provide high-quality semantic and
instance region prompts as prior constraints. Moreover, we design a mutual
prompt mask decoder (MP-Decoder) that leverages cross-guidance to strengthen
the contextual consistency of both tasks, collaboratively computing semantic
and instance segmentation masks. Extensive experiments on the PUMA dataset
demonstrate that the proposed Co-Seg surpasses state-of-the-arts in the
semantic, instance and panoptic segmentation of tumor tissues and nuclei
instances. The source code is available at https://github.com/xq141839/Co-Seg.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前统一多模态理解生成模型在图像生成能力上有显著改进，但在指令遵循和细节保持方面仍与GPT-4o等紧密耦合理解与生成的系统存在较大差距

Method: 提出Interleaving Reasoning Generation (IRG)框架，交替进行基于文本的思考和图像合成：首先生成文本思考来指导初始图像，然后对结果进行反思以细化细节、视觉质量和美学效果。使用IRGL-300K数据集进行两阶段训练

Result: 在GenEval、WISE、TIIF、GenAI-Bench和OneIG-EN等基准测试中获得5-10个百分点的绝对增益，视觉质量和细粒度保真度有显著改善

Conclusion: IRG框架通过交替推理和生成的方式有效提升了文本到图像生成的质量和指令遵循能力，达到了最先进的性能水平

Abstract: Unified multimodal understanding and generation models recently have achieve
significant improvement in image generation capability, yet a large gap remains
in instruction following and detail preservation compared to systems that
tightly couple comprehension with generation such as GPT-4o. Motivated by
recent advances in interleaving reasoning, we explore whether such reasoning
can further improve Text-to-Image (T2I) generation. We introduce Interleaving
Reasoning Generation (IRG), a framework that alternates between text-based
thinking and image synthesis: the model first produces a text-based thinking to
guide an initial image, then reflects on the result to refine fine-grained
details, visual quality, and aesthetics while preserving semantics. To train
IRG effectively, we propose Interleaving Reasoning Generation Learning (IRGL),
which targets two sub-goals: (1) strengthening the initial think-and-generate
stage to establish core content and base quality, and (2) enabling high-quality
textual reflection and faithful implementation of those refinements in a
subsequent image. We curate IRGL-300K, a dataset organized into six decomposed
learning modes that jointly cover learning text-based thinking, and full
thinking-image trajectories. Starting from a unified foundation model that
natively emits interleaved text-image outputs, our two-stage training first
builds robust thinking and reflection, then efficiently tunes the IRG pipeline
in the full thinking-image trajectory data. Extensive experiments show SoTA
performance, yielding absolute gains of 5-10 points on GenEval, WISE, TIIF,
GenAI-Bench, and OneIG-EN, alongside substantial improvements in visual quality
and fine-grained fidelity. The code, model weights and datasets will be
released in: https://github.com/Osilly/Interleaving-Reasoning-Generation .

Conclusion: 通过领域特定数据集的精细调整可有效提升专门领域的背景移除性能，并开源了代码、模型和数据集

Abstract: While state-of-the-art background removal models excel at realistic imagery,
they frequently underperform in specialized domains such as anime-style
content, where complex features like hair and transparency present unique
challenges. To address this limitation, we collected and annotated a custom
dataset of 1,228 high-quality anime images of characters and objects, and
fine-tuned the open-sourced BiRefNet model on this dataset. This resulted in
marked improvements in background removal accuracy for anime-style images,
increasing from 95.3% to 99.5% for our newly introduced Pixel Accuracy metric.

Motivation: 传统感知方法在森林环境中存在延迟、深度分辨率低和光照依赖强等问题，无人机在密林中安全导航和精确数据采集面临挑战。

Method: 设计了一种事件光谱系统，通过结构光进行深度重建，并通过调制投射结构光的波长来获取在650-850nm范围内的光谱信息。

Conclusion: 该系统在实际森林环境中表现优异，为轻量化、集成化的无人机感知和数据采集提供了有力技术支撑。

Abstract: Uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly deployed in forest
environments for tasks such as environmental monitoring and search and rescue,
which require safe navigation through dense foliage and precise data
collection. Traditional sensing approaches, including passive multispectral and
RGB imaging, suffer from latency, poor depth resolution, and strong dependence
on ambient light - especially under forest canopies. In this work, we present a
novel event spectroscopy system that simultaneously enables high-resolution,
low-latency depth reconstruction and multispectral imaging using a single
sensor. Depth is reconstructed using structured light, and by modulating the
wavelength of the projected structured light, our system captures spectral
information in controlled bands between 650 nm and 850 nm. We demonstrate up to
$60\%$ improvement in RMSE over commercial depth sensors and validate the
spectral accuracy against a reference spectrometer and commercial multispectral
cameras, demonstrating comparable performance. A portable version limited to
RGB (3 wavelengths) is used to collect real-world depth and spectral data from
a Masoala Rainforest. We demonstrate the use of this prototype for color image
reconstruction and material differentiation between leaves and branches using
spectral and depth data. Our results show that adding depth (available at no
extra effort with our setup) to material differentiation improves the accuracy
by over $30\%$ compared to color-only method. Our system, tested in both lab
and real-world rainforest environments, shows strong performance in depth
estimation, RGB reconstruction, and material differentiation - paving the way
for lightweight, integrated, and robust UAV perception and data collection in
complex natural environments.

TL;DR: H₂OT是一种分层插拔式剪簇恢复框架，通过动态剪簇冗余帧的姿态token和恢复完整序列，提高视频3D人体姿势估计变化模型的效率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频姿态变化器(VPTs)计算成本高，在资源受限设备上不实用，需要提高效率

Method: 使用两个核心模块：Token Pruning Module(TPM)动态选择代表性token消除冗余，Token Recovering Module(TRM)恢复细细时空信息并扩展到原始分辨率

Result: 在多个标准数据集上验证了方法的有效性和效率，可以同时实现高效率和高估计精度

Conclusion: 维护完整姿态序列并非必要，少量代表性帧的pose token即可达到高效率和准确性，方法通用性强可集成到不同VPT模型

Abstract: Transformers have been successfully applied in the field of video-based 3D
human pose estimation. However, the high computational costs of these video
pose transformers (VPTs) make them impractical on resource-constrained devices.
In this paper, we present a hierarchical plug-and-play pruning-and-recovering
framework, called Hierarchical Hourglass Tokenizer (H$_{2}$OT), for efficient
transformer-based 3D human pose estimation from videos. H$_{2}$OT begins with
progressively pruning pose tokens of redundant frames and ends with recovering
full-length sequences, resulting in a few pose tokens in the intermediate
transformer blocks and thus improving the model efficiency. It works with two
key modules, namely, a Token Pruning Module (TPM) and a Token Recovering Module
(TRM). TPM dynamically selects a few representative tokens to eliminate the
redundancy of video frames, while TRM restores the detailed spatio-temporal
information based on the selected tokens, thereby expanding the network output
to the original full-length temporal resolution for fast inference. Our method
is general-purpose: it can be easily incorporated into common VPT models on
both seq2seq and seq2frame pipelines while effectively accommodating different
token pruning and recovery strategies. In addition, our H$_{2}$OT reveals that
maintaining the full pose sequence is unnecessary, and a few pose tokens of
representative frames can achieve both high efficiency and estimation accuracy.
Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate both the
effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method. Code and models are

Abstract: With the rapid development of computer vision and machine learning, automated
methods for pothole detection and recognition based on image and video data
have received significant attention. It is of great significance for social
development to conduct an in-depth analysis of road images through feature
extraction, thereby achieving automatic identification of the pothole condition
in new images. Consequently, this is the main issue addressed in this study.
Based on preprocessing techniques such as standardization, normalization, and
data augmentation applied to the collected raw dataset, we continuously
improved the network model based on experimental results. Ultimately, we
constructed a deep learning feature extraction network
ResNet50-EfficientNet-RegNet model based on transfer learning. This model
exhibits high classification accuracy and computational efficiency. In terms of
model evaluation, this study employed a comparative evaluation approach by
comparing the performance of the proposed transfer learning model with other

analysis was conducted based on metrics such as Accuracy, Recall, Precision,
F1-score, and FPS, to assess the classification performance of the transfer

exhibits high performance in terms of recognition speed and accuracy,
surpassing the performance of other models. Through careful parameter selection
and model optimization, our transfer learning model achieved a classification

Motivation: 事件相机具有高时间分辨率、低延迟和高动态范围等优势，但高成本、有限分辨率和缺乏自动对焦等功能限制了其广泛应用，特别是在早期开发和原型设计阶段

Method: 通过直接访问原始Bayer数据并绕过传统图像信号处理器(ISP)，基于DVS-Voltmeter模型构建可配置的仿真框架，设计支持原始数据、RGB和事件流同步记录的数据采集管道

Conclusion: 该系统在树莓派上实现实时操作，为基于事件的视觉研究和早期系统开发提供了可扩展且经济高效的解决方案

Abstract: Event cameras offer unique advantages such as high temporal resolution, low
latency, and high dynamic range, making them more and more popular for vision
tasks under challenging light conditions. However, their high cost, limited
resolution, and lack of features such as autofocus hinder their broad adoption,
particularly for early-stage development and prototyping. In this work, we
present Raw2Event, a complete hardware-software system that enables real-time
event generation from low-cost raw frame-based cameras. By leveraging direct
access to raw Bayer data and bypassing traditional image signal processors
(ISP), our system is able to utilize the full potential of camera hardware,
delivering higher dynamic range, higher resolution, and more faithful output
than RGB-based frame-to-event converters.
  Built upon the DVS-Voltmeter model, Raw2Event features a configurable
simulation framework optimized for deployment on embedded platforms. We further
design a data acquisition pipeline that supports synchronized recording of raw,
RGB, and event streams, facilitating downstream evaluation and dataset
creation. Experimental results show that Raw2Event can generate event streams
closely resembling those from real event cameras, while benefiting from higher
resolution and autofocus capabilities. The system also supports user-intuitive
parameter tuning, enabling flexible adaptation to various application
requirements. Finally, we deploy the system on a Raspberry Pi for real-time
operation, providing a scalable and cost-effective solution for event-based

Abstract: Dark humor in online memes poses unique challenges due to its reliance on
implicit, sensitive, and culturally contextual cues. To address the lack of
resources and methods for detecting dark humor in multimodal content, we
introduce a novel dataset of 4,379 Reddit memes annotated for dark humor,
target category (gender, mental health, violence, race, disability, and other),
and a three-level intensity rating (mild, moderate, severe). Building on this
resource, we propose a reasoning-augmented framework that first generates
structured explanations for each meme using a Large Vision-Language Model
(VLM). Through a Role-Reversal Self-Loop, VLM adopts the author's perspective
to iteratively refine its explanations, ensuring completeness and alignment. We
then extract textual features from both the OCR transcript and the self-refined
reasoning via a text encoder, while visual features are obtained using a vision
transformer. A Tri-stream Cross-Reasoning Network (TCRNet) fuses these three
streams, text, image, and reasoning, via pairwise attention mechanisms,
producing a unified representation for classification. Experimental results
demonstrate that our approach outperforms strong baselines across three tasks:
dark humor detection, target identification, and intensity prediction. The
dataset, annotations, and code are released to facilitate further research in
multimodal humor understanding and content moderation. Code and Dataset are

Abstract: This article presents UrbanTwin datasets - high-fidelity, realistic replicas
of three public roadside lidar datasets: LUMPI, V2X-Real-IC, and TUMTraf-I.
Each UrbanTwin dataset contains 10K annotated frames corresponding to one of
the public datasets. Annotations include 3D bounding boxes, instance
segmentation labels, and tracking IDs for six object classes, along with
semantic segmentation labels for nine classes. These datasets are synthesized
using emulated lidar sensors within realistic digital twins, modeled based on
surrounding geometry, road alignment at lane level, and the lane topology and
vehicle movement patterns at intersections of the actual locations
corresponding to each real dataset. Due to the precise digital twin modeling,
the synthetic datasets are well aligned with their real counterparts, offering
strong standalone and augmentative value for training deep learning models on
tasks such as 3D object detection, tracking, and semantic and instance
segmentation. We evaluate the alignment of the synthetic replicas through
statistical and structural similarity analysis with real data, and further
demonstrate their utility by training 3D object detection models solely on
synthetic data and testing them on real, unseen data. The high similarity
scores and improved detection performance, compared to the models trained on
real data, indicate that the UrbanTwin datasets effectively enhance existing
benchmark datasets by increasing sample size and scene diversity. In addition,
the digital twins can be adapted to test custom scenarios by modifying the
design and dynamics of the simulations. To our knowledge, these are the first
digitally synthesized datasets that can replace in-domain real-world datasets
for lidar perception tasks. UrbanTwin datasets are publicly available at

Abstract: Segmenting 3D assets into their constituent parts is crucial for enhancing 3D
understanding, facilitating model reuse, and supporting various applications
such as part generation. However, current methods face limitations such as poor
robustness when dealing with complex objects and cannot fully automate the
process. In this paper, we propose a native 3D point-promptable part
segmentation model termed P3-SAM, designed to fully automate the segmentation
of any 3D objects into components. Inspired by SAM, P3-SAM consists of a
feature extractor, multiple segmentation heads, and an IoU predictor, enabling
interactive segmentation for users. We also propose an algorithm to
automatically select and merge masks predicted by our model for part instance
segmentation. Our model is trained on a newly built dataset containing nearly
3.7 million models with reasonable segmentation labels. Comparisons show that
our method achieves precise segmentation results and strong robustness on any
complex objects, attaining state-of-the-art performance. Our code will be
released soon.

Conclusion: 通过3D生成技术实现的real2sim2real系统有效解决了现有传感模拟方案在多样性、可扩展性和通用性方面的限制

Abstract: In the field of autonomous driving, sensor simulation is essential for
generating rare and diverse scenarios that are difficult to capture in
real-world environments. Current solutions fall into two categories: 1)
CG-based methods, such as CARLA, which lack diversity and struggle to scale to
the vast array of rare cases required for robust perception training; and 2)
learning-based approaches, such as NeuSim, which are limited to specific object
categories (vehicles) and require extensive multi-sensor data, hindering their
applicability to generic objects. To address these limitations, we propose a
scalable real2sim2real system that leverages 3D generation to automate asset
mining, generation, and rare-case data synthesis.

TL;DR: MIORe和VAR-MIORe是两个新颖的多任务运动恢复数据集，通过高帧率采集和专业光学设备捕捉复杂运动场景，提供可控的运动模糊和清晰输入，为图像和视频恢复任务建立新基准。


<details>

Motivation: 解决当前运动恢复基准测试的关键局限性，缺乏对复杂运动场景（如自我相机运动、多主体交互、深度相关模糊）的全面覆盖，以及缺乏对运动幅度的明确控制。

Method: 使用1000FPS高帧率采集和专业级光学设备捕捉广泛运动场景；通过基于光流指标的自适应帧平均生成一致运动模糊；VAR-MIORe通过可变运动幅度范围（从最小到极端）扩展数据集。

Abstract: We introduce MIORe and VAR-MIORe, two novel multi-task datasets that address
critical limitations in current motion restoration benchmarks. Designed with
high-frame-rate (1000 FPS) acquisition and professional-grade optics, our
datasets capture a broad spectrum of motion scenarios, which include complex
ego-camera movements, dynamic multi-subject interactions, and depth-dependent
blur effects. By adaptively averaging frames based on computed optical flow
metrics, MIORe generates consistent motion blur, and preserves sharp inputs for
video frame interpolation and optical flow estimation. VAR-MIORe further
extends by spanning a variable range of motion magnitudes, from minimal to
extreme, establishing the first benchmark to offer explicit control over motion
amplitude. We provide high-resolution, scalable ground truths that challenge
existing algorithms under both controlled and adverse conditions, paving the
way for next-generation research of various image and video restoration tasks.

TL;DR: 这篇论文研究了如何通过迁移学习调整基础模型和整合手术室多模态数据来支持手术数据科学，在手术视频分析任务中得到了显著性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索通过基础模型的领域适配和多模态数据整合来提升手术数据科学的性能，以支持微创手术的决策支持。

Method: 使用V-JEPA基础模型作为单模态基础，通过在未标注手术视频数据上微调进行领域适配，并整合手术室的其他时间分辨数据流构建多模态模型。

Result: 领域特定数据的微调显著提升了模型性能，整合额外数据流也产生了积极效果。在HeiCo数据集上，单模态基线模型的准确度已经跟EndoVis2017挑战赛的最佳提交结果相当，微调后进一步提升了准确度。

Conclusion: 手术数据科学可以利用公开的通用基础模型，通过领域适配和整合适当的补充数据流来获得显著性能改善。

Abstract: We investigate how both the adaptation of a generic foundation model via
transfer learning and the integration of complementary modalities from the
operating room (OR) can support surgical data science. To this end, we use
V-JEPA as the single-modality foundation of a multimodal model for minimally
invasive surgery support. We analyze how the model's downstream performance can
benefit (a) from finetuning on unlabeled surgical video data and (b) from
providing additional time-resolved data streams from the OR in a multimodal
setup.
  In an in-house dataset of liver surgery videos, we analyze the tasks of
predicting hospital length of stay and postoperative complications. In videos
of the public HeiCo dataset, we analyze the task of surgical phase recognition.
As a baseline, we apply pretrained V-JEPA to all tasks. We then finetune it on
unlabeled, held-out videos to investigate its change in performance after
domain adaptation. Following the idea of modular decision support networks, we
integrate additional data streams from the OR by training a separate encoder to
form a shared representation space with V-JEPA's embeddings.
  Our experiments show that finetuning on domain-specific data increases model
performance. On the in-house data, integrating additional time-resolved data
likewise benefits the model. On the HeiCo data, accuracy of the pretrained
video-only, single-modality baseline setup is on par with the top-performing
submissions of the EndoVis2017 challenge, while finetuning on domain-specific
data increases accuracy further. Our results thus demonstrate how surgical data
science can leverage public, generic foundation models. Likewise, they indicate
the potential of domain adaptation and of integrating suitable complementary
data streams from the OR. To support further research, we release our code and
model weights at https://github.com/DigitalSurgeryLab-Basel/ML-CDS-2025.

Method (FGSM) and Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) attacks. Our results show a
sharp decline in classification accuracy as the perturbation magnitude

study lays the groundwork for future exploration into defense mechanisms
tailored for real-world traffic sign recognition systems.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种拓扑适应性变形模型，用于处理包含拓扑偏差的非粗粒3D网格匹配问题，能够在拓扑变化的情况下完成准确的对齐和对应关系提取。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前方法在处理包含拓扑偏差的3D网格时的限制，特别是在多视角重建等实际应用场景中，这些偏差会破坏方法偏向于假设的近等距变形或ARAP变形。

Method: 提出拓扑适应性变形模型，允许形状拓扑发生改变来对齐形状对。通过聚合优化模板网格和其与待匹配形状的对齐，在ARAP和双射关联约束下提取对应关系。

Result: 方法能够处理高度非等距形状和包含拓扑偏差的形状，包括噪声多视角重建，在3D对齐质量上甚至超过基于大规模数据集训练的方法。

Conclusion: 该方法不依赖于任何数据驱动先验知识，能够有效处理实际应用中的拓扑偏差问题，为计算机视觉和计算机图形学流水线提供了可靠的非粗粒3D网格匹配方案。

Abstract: Non-rigid 3D mesh matching is a critical step in computer vision and computer
graphics pipelines. We tackle matching meshes that contain topological
artefacts which can break the assumption made by current approaches. While
Functional Maps assume the deformation induced by the ground truth
correspondences to be near-isometric, ARAP-like deformation-guided approaches
assume the latter to be ARAP. Neither assumption holds in certain topological
configurations of the input shapes. We are motivated by real-world scenarios
such as per-frame multi-view reconstructions, often suffering from topological
artefacts. To this end, we propose a topology-adaptive deformation model
allowing changes in shape topology to align shape pairs under ARAP and
bijective association constraints. Using this model, we jointly optimise for a
template mesh with adequate topology and for its alignment with the shapes to
be matched to extract correspondences. We show that, while not relying on any
data-driven prior, our approach applies to highly non-isometric shapes and
shapes with topological artefacts, including noisy per-frame multi-view
reconstructions, even outperforming methods trained on large datasets in 3D
alignment quality.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种结合选择性GAN去模糊预处理和YOLOv5目标检测的自动车牌识别系统，在实时性和准确性方面都取得了显著成效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动车牌识别(ALPR)在智慧城市中至关重要，但高变化性带来挑战，需要深度学习技术更有效解决。特别是当车牌模糊时，识别准确率会显著下降。

Method: 采用选择性GAN进行去模糊预处理，避免不必要的输入操作。结合YOLOv5对象检测架构进行车牌检测(LPD)，以及集成的字符分割(CS)和字符识别(CR)步骤。

Result: 检测时间仅0.026秒，支持实时应用。LPD准确率95%，CR准确率97%。去模糊GAN预处理器将检测准确率提高近40%，特别是对模糊车牌。

Conclusion: 综合模型在精度和检测速度方面表现优异，适合移动应用。去模糊GAN预处理步骤显著提升了整体模型效果，特别在处理摄像头抓取的模糊场景时。

Abstract: Automatic License-Plate Recognition (ALPR) plays a pivotal role in
Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) as a fundamental element of Smart
Cities. However, due to its high variability, ALPR faces challenging issues
more efficiently addressed by deep learning techniques. In this paper, a
selective Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) is proposed for deblurring in
the preprocessing step, coupled with the state-of-the-art You-Only-Look-Once
(YOLO)v5 object detection architectures for License-Plate Detection (LPD), and
the integrated Character Segmentation (CS) and Character Recognition (CR)
steps. The selective preprocessing bypasses unnecessary and sometimes
counter-productive input manipulations, while YOLOv5 LPD/CS+CR delivers high
accuracy and low computing cost. As a result, YOLOv5 achieves a detection time
of 0.026 seconds for both LP and CR detection stages, facilitating real-time
applications with exceptionally rapid responsiveness. Moreover, the proposed
model achieves accuracy rates of 95\% and 97\% in the LPD and CR detection
phases, respectively. Furthermore, the inclusion of the Deblur-GAN
pre-processor significantly improves detection accuracy by nearly 40\%,
especially when encountering blurred License Plates (LPs).To train and test the
learning components, we generated and publicly released our blur and ALPR
datasets (using Iranian license plates as a use-case), which are more
representative of close-to-real-life ad-hoc situations. The findings
demonstrate that employing the state-of-the-art YOLO model results in excellent
overall precision and detection time, making it well-suited for portable
applications. Additionally, integrating the Deblur-GAN model as a preliminary
processing step enhances the overall effectiveness of our comprehensive model,
particularly when confronted with blurred scenes captured by the camera as
input.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有欧几里得近似方法扭曲流形结构并减缓收敛速度，需要更好的方法来捕捉复杂流形结构

Method: 使用CNN-Transformer编码器提取特征嵌入，投影到球形空间，在双不变SO(4)空间中使用Riemannian距离近似测地距离，推理时采用可微Levenberg-Marquardt优化

Result: 在真实和合成数据集上实验显示，在患者特定和患者无关场景下均获得优越的准确性

Conclusion: 非欧几里得球形特征空间的相似性学习方法能够更好地捕捉复杂流形结构，提高2D/3D配准性能

Abstract: Intraoperative 2D/3D registration aligns preoperative 3D volumes with
real-time 2D radiographs, enabling accurate localization of instruments and
implants. A recent fully differentiable similarity learning framework
approximates geodesic distances on SE(3), expanding the capture range of
registration and mitigating the effects of substantial disturbances, but
existing Euclidean approximations distort manifold structure and slow
convergence. To address these limitations, we explore similarity learning in
non-Euclidean spherical feature spaces to better capture and fit complex
manifold structure. We extract feature embeddings using a CNN-Transformer
encoder, project them into spherical space, and approximate their geodesic
distances with Riemannian distances in the bi-invariant SO(4) space. This
enables a more expressive and geometrically consistent deep similarity metric,
enhancing the ability to distinguish subtle pose differences. During inference,
we replace gradient descent with fully differentiable Levenberg-Marquardt
optimization to accelerate convergence. Experiments on real and synthetic
datasets show superior accuracy in both patient-specific and patient-agnostic
scenarios.

Conclusion: BIR-Adapter提供了一种高效、低复杂度的盲图像恢复解决方案，具有良好的扩展性和应用前景。

Abstract: This paper introduces BIR-Adapter, a low-complexity blind image restoration
adapter for diffusion models. The BIR-Adapter enables the utilization of the
prior of pre-trained large-scale diffusion models on blind image restoration
without training any auxiliary feature extractor. We take advantage of the
robustness of pretrained models. We extract features from degraded images via
the model itself and extend the self-attention mechanism with these degraded
features. We introduce a sampling guidance mechanism to reduce hallucinations.
We perform experiments on synthetic and real-world degradations and demonstrate
that BIR-Adapter achieves competitive or better performance compared to
state-of-the-art methods while having significantly lower complexity.
Additionally, its adapter-based design enables integration into other diffusion
models, enabling broader applications in image restoration tasks. We showcase
this by extending a super-resolution-only model to perform better under
additional unknown degradations.

Abstract: Vision-driven field monitoring is central to digital agriculture, yet models
built on general-domain pretrained backbones often fail to generalize across
tasks, owing to the interaction of fine, variable canopy structures with
fluctuating field conditions. We present FoMo4Wheat, one of the first
crop-domain vision foundation model pretrained with self-supervision on
ImAg4Wheat, the largest and most diverse wheat image dataset to date (2.5
million high-resolution images collected over a decade at 30 global sites,
spanning >2,000 genotypes and >500 environmental conditions). This
wheat-specific pretraining yields representations that are robust for wheat and
transferable to other crops and weeds. Across ten in-field vision tasks at
canopy and organ levels, FoMo4Wheat models consistently outperform
state-of-the-art models pretrained on general-domain dataset. These results
demonstrate the value of crop-specific foundation models for reliable in-field
perception and chart a path toward a universal crop foundation model with
cross-species and cross-task capabilities. FoMo4Wheat models and the ImAg4Wheat

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文系统性评估了LLM反学习中的常见实践，发现依赖单一邻近集和标准采样方法存在问题，并提出了包含多样化邻近集和模块化实体级反学习策略的最佳实践。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM反学习研究中常见的单一邻近集和标准采样方法的效果和稳定性未经过严格评估，且无法反映真实世界数据的复杂性和关系。

Method: 系统性评估常见实践，提出并验证了一组最佳实践：包括多样化邻近集、改进采样方法，以及模块化实体级反学习策略(MELU)。

Result: 发现依赖单一邻近集是次优的，标准采样方法效率低且效果差，而提出的模块化方法结合健壮算法能够提供明确稳定的反学习路径。

Conclusion: 需要采用多样化邻近集来平衡反学习效果和模型效用，并以模块化实体级反学习策略替代循环采样方法，以实现更有效的反学习。

Abstract: A conventional LLM Unlearning setting consists of two subsets -"forget" and
"retain", with the objectives of removing the undesired knowledge from the
forget set while preserving the remaining knowledge from the retain. In
privacy-focused unlearning research, a retain set is often further divided into
neighbor sets, containing either directly or indirectly connected to the forget
targets; and augmented by a general-knowledge set. A common practice in
existing benchmarks is to employ only a single neighbor set, with general
knowledge which fails to reflect the real-world data complexities and
relationships. LLM Unlearning typically involves 1:1 sampling or cyclic
iteration sampling. However, the efficacy and stability of these de facto
standards have not been critically examined. In this study, we systematically
evaluate these common practices. Our findings reveal that relying on a single
neighbor set is suboptimal and that a standard sampling approach can obscure
performance trade-offs. Based on this analysis, we propose and validate an
initial set of best practices: (1) Incorporation of diverse neighbor sets to
balance forget efficacy and model utility, (2) Standard 1:1 sampling methods
are inefficient and yield poor results, (3) Our proposed Modular Entity-Level
Unlearning (MELU) strategy as an alternative to cyclic sampling. We demonstrate
that this modular approach, combined with robust algorithms, provides a clear
and stable path towards effective unlearning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的正则化方法，通过在函数空间中约束微调模型与预训练模型的距离，并引入一致性正则化来增强OOD鲁棒性，在各种CLIP骨干网络上都能一致提升下游任务的ID性能和OOD鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的鲁棒微调方法不能总是改善不同模型架构的OOD鲁棒性，因为OOD鲁棒性要求模型函数对下游任务的输入信息产生稳定的预测，而现有方法在函数空间优化方面表现不佳。

Method: 提出函数空间距离约束正则化，使用模拟OOD样本来约束微调模型与预训练模型在函数空间中的距离；引入额外的一致性正则化来促进扰动样本的稳定预测。

Result: 大量实验表明，该方法在各种CLIP骨干网络上都能一致提升下游任务的ID微调性能和OOD鲁棒性，优于现有的基于正则化的鲁棒微调方法。

Conclusion: 通过在函数空间中约束模型距离并引入一致性正则化，能够有效保持预训练模型的OOD鲁棒性，同时提升下游任务的性能。

Abstract: Robust fine-tuning aims to achieve competitive in-distribution (ID)
performance while maintaining the out-of-distribution (OOD) robustness of a
pre-trained model when transferring it to a downstream task. To remedy this,
most robust fine-tuning methods aim to preserve the pretrained weights,
features, or logits. However, we find that these methods cannot always improve
OOD robustness for different model architectures. This is due to the OOD
robustness requiring the model function to produce stable prediction for input
information of downstream tasks, while existing methods might serve as a poor
proxy for the optimization in the function space. Based on this finding, we
propose a novel regularization that constrains the distance of fine-tuning and
pre-trained model in the function space with the simulated OOD samples, aiming
to preserve the OOD robustness of the pre-trained model. Besides, to further
enhance the OOD robustness capability of the fine-tuning model, we introduce an
additional consistency regularization to promote stable predictions of
perturbed samples. Extensive experiments demonstrate our approach could
consistently improve both downstream task ID fine-tuning performance and OOD
robustness across a variety of CLIP backbones, outperforming existing
regularization-based robust fine-tuning methods.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了图神经网络(GNN)中的拓扑隐私风险，提出了拓扑推理攻击(TIAs)来重建训练图结构，并开发了Private Graph Reconstruction(PGR)防御框架来保护拓扑隐私同时保持模型精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GNN的广泛应用引发了严重的隐私问题，现有研究主要关注边级隐私，而拓扑隐私（图整体结构的机密性）这一关键威胁尚未得到充分探索。

Method: 提出了拓扑推理攻击(TIAs)来评估风险，并开发了PGR防御框架，采用双层优化方法，通过元梯度迭代生成合成训练图，同时基于演化图更新GNN模型。

Result: 研究发现GNN对这些攻击高度脆弱，现有边级差分隐私机制要么无法缓解风险，要么严重损害模型精度。PGR显著减少了拓扑泄露，对模型精度影响最小。

Conclusion: 拓扑隐私是GNN中一个被忽视但重要的威胁，PGR框架为保护图结构隐私提供了有效解决方案，在保持模型性能的同时增强了隐私保护。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as powerful models for learning
from graph-structured data. However, their widespread adoption has raised
serious privacy concerns. While prior research has primarily focused on
edge-level privacy, a critical yet underexplored threat lies in topology
privacy - the confidentiality of the graph's overall structure. In this work,
we present a comprehensive study on topology privacy risks in GNNs, revealing
their vulnerability to graph-level inference attacks. To this end, we propose a
suite of Topology Inference Attacks (TIAs) that can reconstruct the structure
of a target training graph using only black-box access to a GNN model. Our
findings show that GNNs are highly susceptible to these attacks, and that
existing edge-level differential privacy mechanisms are insufficient as they
either fail to mitigate the risk or severely compromise model accuracy. To
address this challenge, we introduce Private Graph Reconstruction (PGR), a
novel defense framework designed to protect topology privacy while maintaining
model accuracy. PGR is formulated as a bi-level optimization problem, where a
synthetic training graph is iteratively generated using meta-gradients, and the
GNN model is concurrently updated based on the evolving graph. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that PGR significantly reduces topology leakage with
minimal impact on model accuracy. Our code is anonymously available at

Motivation: 现有研究表明成员推理攻击对大型语言模型效果仅略优于随机猜测，认为现代预训练方法可能不存在隐私泄露风险。本文旨在通过探索模型内部表示来发现传统基于损失的方法可能遗漏的成员推理信号。

Method: 提出memTrace框架，通过分析transformer隐藏状态和注意力模式的"神经痕迹"，包括层级表示动态、注意力分布特征和跨层转换模式，来检测潜在的记忆指纹。

Result: 在多个模型家族上实现了强大的成员检测能力，在流行的MIA基准测试中平均AUC得分达到0.85，显著优于传统方法。

Conclusion: 即使基于输出的信号看似受到保护，模型内部行为仍能揭示训练数据暴露的方面，强调需要进一步研究成员隐私并为大型语言模型开发更强大的隐私保护训练技术。

Abstract: Membership inference attacks (MIAs) reveal whether specific data was used to
train machine learning models, serving as important tools for privacy auditing
and compliance assessment. Recent studies have reported that MIAs perform only
marginally better than random guessing against large language models,
suggesting that modern pre-training approaches with massive datasets may be
free from privacy leakage risks. Our work offers a complementary perspective to
these findings by exploring how examining LLMs' internal representations,
rather than just their outputs, may provide additional insights into potential
membership inference signals. Our framework, \emph{memTrace}, follows what we
call \enquote{neural breadcrumbs} extracting informative signals from
transformer hidden states and attention patterns as they process candidate
sequences. By analyzing layer-wise representation dynamics, attention
distribution characteristics, and cross-layer transition patterns, we detect
potential memorization fingerprints that traditional loss-based approaches may
not capture. This approach yields strong membership detection across several
model families achieving average AUC scores of 0.85 on popular MIA benchmarks.
Our findings suggest that internal model behaviors can reveal aspects of
training data exposure even when output-based signals appear protected,
highlighting the need for further research into membership privacy and the
development of more robust privacy-preserving training techniques for large
language models.

TL;DR: Spotify提出基于情境多臂老虎机的校准方法，动态学习用户在不同情境下的最优内容类型分布，解决历史数据偏向音乐内容的问题，提升用户参与度和非音乐内容的曝光。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Spotify首页内容类型多样但历史数据严重偏向音乐，难以提供平衡的个性化内容组合。用户对不同内容类型的偏好会随时间、日期和设备等情境因素变化。

Method: 使用情境多臂老虎机方法，动态学习每个用户在不同情境下的最优内容类型分布，而非依赖历史平均值。

Result: 离线和在线实验均显示，该方法提高了Spotify首页的推荐精度和用户参与度，特别是对播客等代表性不足的内容类型效果显著。

Conclusion: 基于情境多臂老虎机的校准方法能有效适应用户兴趣在不同情境下的变化，提升内容推荐的平衡性和个性化效果。

Abstract: Spotify's Home page features a variety of content types, including music,
podcasts, and audiobooks. However, historical data is heavily skewed toward
music, making it challenging to deliver a balanced and personalized content
mix. Moreover, users' preference towards different content types may vary
depending on the time of day, the day of week, or even the device they use. We
propose a calibration method that leverages contextual bandits to dynamically
learn each user's optimal content type distribution based on their context and
preferences. Unlike traditional calibration methods that rely on historical
averages, our approach boosts engagement by adapting to how users interests in
different content types varies across contexts. Both offline and online results
demonstrate improved precision and user engagement with the Spotify Home page,
in particular with under-represented content types such as podcasts.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PLanTS是一个周期性感知的自监督学习框架，通过多粒度分块机制和对比损失来建模多元时间序列的潜在状态和转换，在多个下游任务中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多元时间序列存在高维度、标注数据有限和非平稳性等挑战，现有自监督学习方法忽略了内在周期性结构，无法捕捉潜在状态的动态演化。

Method: 提出周期性感知的多粒度分块机制和广义对比损失，设计下一个转换预测的预训练任务，以编码未来状态演化的预测信息。

Result: 在多元分类、预测、轨迹跟踪和异常检测等任务中，PLanTS相比现有自监督学习方法显著提升了表示质量，且比基于DTW的方法具有更好的运行时效率。

Conclusion: PLanTS通过显式建模不规则潜在状态及其转换，有效解决了多元时间序列分析中的关键挑战，为周期性时间序列的自监督学习提供了新思路。

Abstract: Multivariate time series (MTS) are ubiquitous in domains such as healthcare,
climate science, and industrial monitoring, but their high dimensionality,
limited labeled data, and non-stationary nature pose significant challenges for
conventional machine learning methods. While recent self-supervised learning
(SSL) approaches mitigate label scarcity by data augmentations or time
point-based contrastive strategy, they neglect the intrinsic periodic structure
of MTS and fail to capture the dynamic evolution of latent states. We propose
PLanTS, a periodicity-aware self-supervised learning framework that explicitly
models irregular latent states and their transitions. We first designed a
period-aware multi-granularity patching mechanism and a generalized contrastive
loss to preserve both instance-level and state-level similarities across
multiple temporal resolutions. To further capture temporal dynamics, we design
a next-transition prediction pretext task that encourages representations to
encode predictive information about future state evolution. We evaluate PLanTS
across a wide range of downstream tasks-including multi-class and multi-label
classification, forecasting, trajectory tracking and anomaly detection. PLanTS
consistently improves the representation quality over existing SSL methods and
demonstrates superior runtime efficiency compared to DTW-based methods.

Conclusion: STL规范为BNNs训练提供了有效的目标定义方法，成功实现了生物系统中的复杂功能，为生物分子计算开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Biomolecular Neural Networks (BNNs), artificial neural networks with
biologically synthesizable architectures, achieve universal function
approximation capabilities beyond simple biological circuits. However, training
BNNs remains challenging due to the lack of target data. To address this, we
propose leveraging Signal Temporal Logic (STL) specifications to define
training objectives for BNNs. We build on the quantitative semantics of STL,
enabling gradient-based optimization of the BNN weights, and introduce a
learning algorithm that enables BNNs to perform regression and control tasks in
biological systems. Specifically, we investigate two regression problems in
which we train BNNs to act as reporters of dysregulated states, and a feedback
control problem in which we train the BNN in closed-loop with a chronic disease
model, learning to reduce inflammation while avoiding adverse responses to
external infections. Our numerical experiments demonstrate that STL-based
learning can solve the investigated regression and control tasks efficiently.

Motivation: 解决图像分类模型在遇到距离训练数据分布的未见数据时预测不可靠的问题，提高模型在实际应用中的可靠性。

Method: 基于训练数据在嵌入空间中的分布，通过计算未见数据与训练分布的距离来评估预测信心度，并使用多个嵌入模型获取更稳健的信心度估计。

Result: 在多个分类模型上均实现了一致的性能提升，通过过滤低信心度预测显著提高了分类准确性，多嵌入模型组合进一步提高了分布外样本检测能力。

Conclusion: 该方法模型无关且具有良好的可扩展性，不仅适用于计算机视觉领域，还有潜力应用于自然语言处理等需要预测可靠性的领域。

Abstract: This paper investigates the impact of training data distribution on the
performance of image classification models. By analyzing the embeddings of the
training set, we propose a framework to understand the confidence of model
predictions on unseen data without the need for retraining. Our approach
filters out low-confidence predictions based on their distance from the
training distribution in the embedding space, significantly improving
classification accuracy. We demonstrate this on the example of several
classification models, showing consistent performance gains across
architectures. Furthermore, we show that using multiple embedding models to
represent the training data enables a more robust estimation of confidence, as
different embeddings capture complementary aspects of the data. Combining these
embeddings allows for better detection and exclusion of out-of-distribution
samples, resulting in further accuracy improvements. The proposed method is
model-agnostic and generalizable, with potential applications beyond computer
vision, including domains such as Natural Language Processing where prediction
reliability is critical.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mamba模型在微控制器部署面临内存限制、缺乏原生算子支持和嵌入式友好工具链等挑战，需要开发轻量级部署方案。

Method: 1) 导出模型权重为轻量格式；2) 手工实现C语言Mamba层和支持算子，采用算子融合和内存布局优化；3) 消除大型中间张量。

Result: 峰值内存减少83.0%，数值误差仅1.7x10-5，在关键词识别和人体活动识别任务上达到100%精度一致性，在ESP32S3和STM32H7上验证了可移植性。

Conclusion: MambaLite-Micro成功将先进序列模型Mamba部署到资源受限嵌入式平台，为实际应用铺平道路。

Abstract: Deploying Mamba models on microcontrollers (MCUs) remains challenging due to
limited memory, the lack of native operator support, and the absence of
embedded-friendly toolchains. We present, to our knowledge, the first
deployment of a Mamba-based neural architecture on a resource-constrained MCU,
a fully C-based runtime-free inference engine: MambaLite-Micro. Our pipeline
maps a trained PyTorch Mamba model to on-device execution by (1) exporting
model weights into a lightweight format, and (2) implementing a handcrafted
Mamba layer and supporting operators in C with operator fusion and memory
layout optimization. MambaLite-Micro eliminates large intermediate tensors,
reducing 83.0% peak memory, while maintaining an average numerical error of
only 1.7x10-5 relative to the PyTorch Mamba implementation. When evaluated on
keyword spotting(KWS) and human activity recognition (HAR) tasks,
MambaLite-Micro achieved 100% consistency with the PyTorch baselines, fully
preserving classification accuracy. We further validated portability by
deploying on both ESP32S3 and STM32H7 microcontrollers, demonstrating
consistent operation across heterogeneous embedded platforms and paving the way
for bringing advanced sequence models like Mamba to real-world
resource-constrained applications.

*Peixuan Han,Adit Krishnan,Gerald Friedland,Jiaxuan You,Chris Kong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出自对齐奖励(SAR)方法，通过相对困惑度差异来同时提升大语言模型的推理准确性和效率，相比传统二元奖励信号在准确率提升4%的同时降低30%推理成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的可验证奖励信号过于粗糙，只提供二元正确性反馈，导致推理过程冗长、计算成本高，且现有解决方案往往牺牲准确性。

Method: 引入自对齐奖励(SAR)，定义为基于查询的答案与独立答案之间的相对困惑度差异，偏好简洁且查询特定的响应。

Result: 在4个模型和7个基准测试中，SAR与PPO、GRPO等RL算法结合使准确率提高4%，推理成本降低30%，实现了正确性与效率的帕累托最优权衡。

Conclusion: SAR作为一种细粒度的奖励信号补充，能够在不丢失关键推理的情况下抑制不必要的阐述，为更高效有效的LLM训练铺平道路。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards has significantly advanced
reasoning in large language models (LLMs), but such signals remain coarse,
offering only binary correctness feedback. This limitation often results in
inefficiencies, including overly verbose reasoning and high computational cost,
while existing solutions often compromise accuracy. To address this, we
introduce self-aligned reward (SAR), a self-guided signal that complements
verifiable rewards to encourage both reasoning accuracy and efficiency. SAR is
defined as the relative perplexity difference between an answer conditioned on
the query and the standalone answer, thereby favoring responses that are
concise and query-specific. Quantitative analysis reveals that SAR reliably
distinguishes answer quality: concise, correct answers score higher than
redundant ones, and partially correct answers score higher than entirely
incorrect ones. Evaluation on 4 models across 7 benchmarks shows that
integrating SAR with prevalent RL algorithms like PPO and GRPO improves
accuracy by 4%, while reducing inference cost by 30%. Further analysis
demonstrates that SAR achieves a Pareto-optimal trade-off between correctness
and efficiency compared to reward signals based on length or self-confidence.
We also show that SAR shortens responses while preserving advanced reasoning
behaviors, demonstrating its ability to suppress unnecessary elaboration
without losing critical reasoning. These results highlight the promise of
self-aligned reward as a fine-grained complement to verifiable rewards, paving
the way for more efficient and effective LLM training.

Motivation: 传统分层强化学习在自动发现任务层次结构和联合训练多级策略时存在不稳定性和缺乏理论保证的问题，需要一种更原则性的方法来处理长时域目标条件任务。

Conclusion: RLA框架为解决长时域目标条件任务中的分层强化学习问题提供了一个有理论保证的、可扩展的解决方案，通过预期模型和价值几何一致性原则实现了稳定的多级策略学习。

Abstract: Solving long-horizon goal-conditioned tasks remains a significant challenge
in reinforcement learning (RL). Hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL)
addresses this by decomposing tasks into more manageable sub-tasks, but the
automatic discovery of the hierarchy and the joint training of multi-level
policies often suffer from instability and can lack theoretical guarantees. In
this paper, we introduce Reinforcement Learning with Anticipation (RLA), a
principled and potentially scalable framework designed to address these
limitations. The RLA agent learns two synergistic models: a low-level,
goal-conditioned policy that learns to reach specified subgoals, and a
high-level anticipation model that functions as a planner, proposing
intermediate subgoals on the optimal path to a final goal. The key feature of
RLA is the training of the anticipation model, which is guided by a principle
of value geometric consistency, regularized to prevent degenerate solutions. We
present proofs that RLA approaches the globally optimal policy under various
conditions, establishing a principled and convergent method for hierarchical
planning and execution in long-horizon goal-conditioned tasks.

TL;DR: ProfilingAgent是一个基于LLM的多智能体系统，通过分析静态指标和动态性能信号，自动执行结构化剪枝和动态量化，实现模型压缩和优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基础模型面临计算和内存瓶颈，现有压缩技术大多依赖统一启发式方法，忽略了架构和运行时异质性，需要更智能的自动化压缩方案。

Method: 使用大型语言模型构建模块化多智能体系统，结合静态指标（MACs、参数量）和动态信号（延迟、内存）来设计特定架构的压缩策略，进行结构化剪枝和后训练动态量化。

Result: 在多个数据集和模型上，剪枝保持或提升准确率（ImageNet-1K下降约1%，小数据集上ViT-B/16提升2%），量化实现最高74%内存节省和<0.5%准确率损失，推理速度提升达1.74倍。

Conclusion: 智能体系统是可扩展的配置文件引导模型优化解决方案，LLM推理质量对迭代剪枝至关重要。

Abstract: Foundation models face growing compute and memory bottlenecks, hindering
deployment on resource-limited platforms. While compression techniques such as
pruning and quantization are widely used, most rely on uniform heuristics that
ignore architectural and runtime heterogeneity. Profiling tools expose
per-layer latency, memory, and compute cost, yet are rarely integrated into
automated pipelines. We propose ProfilingAgent, a profiling-guided, agentic
approach that uses large language models (LLMs) to automate compression via
structured pruning and post-training dynamic quantization. Our modular
multi-agent system reasons over static metrics (MACs, parameter counts) and
dynamic signals (latency, memory) to design architecture-specific strategies.
Unlike heuristic baselines, ProfilingAgent tailors layer-wise decisions to
bottlenecks. Experiments on ImageNet-1K, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100 with
ResNet-101, ViT-B/16, Swin-B, and DeiT-B/16 show pruning maintains competitive
or improved accuracy (about 1% drop on ImageNet-1K, +2% gains for ViT-B/16 on
smaller datasets), while quantization achieves up to 74% memory savings with
<0.5% accuracy loss. Our quantization also yields consistent inference speedups
of up to 1.74 times faster. Comparative studies with GPT-4o and GPT-4-Turbo
highlight the importance of LLM reasoning quality for iterative pruning. These
results establish agentic systems as scalable solutions for profiling-guided
model optimization.

Conclusion: Persona提供了一种高效的方法来处理设备上的数据分布偏移问题，无需昂贵的重新训练，显著提升了模型在动态环境中的泛化性能。

Abstract: The on-device real-time data distribution shift on devices challenges the
generalization of lightweight on-device models. This critical issue is often
overlooked in current research, which predominantly relies on data-intensive
and computationally expensive fine-tuning approaches. To tackle this, we
introduce Persona, a novel personalized method using a prototype-based,
backpropagation-free parameter editing framework to enhance model
generalization without post-deployment retraining. Persona employs a neural
adapter in the cloud to generate a parameter editing matrix based on real-time
device data. This matrix adeptly adapts on-device models to the prevailing data
distributions, efficiently clustering them into prototype models. The
prototypes are dynamically refined via the parameter editing matrix,
facilitating efficient evolution. Furthermore, the integration of cross-layer
knowledge transfer ensures consistent and context-aware multi-layer parameter
changes and prototype assignment. Extensive experiments on vision task and
recommendation task on multiple datasets confirm Persona's effectiveness and
generality.

Abstract: Medical multimodal representation learning aims to integrate heterogeneous
clinical data into unified patient representations to support predictive
modeling, which remains an essential yet challenging task in the medical data
mining community. However, real-world medical datasets often suffer from
missing modalities due to cost, protocol, or patient-specific constraints.
Existing methods primarily address this issue by learning from the available
observations in either the raw data space or feature space, but typically
neglect the underlying bias introduced by the data acquisition process itself.
In this work, we identify two types of biases that hinder model generalization:
missingness bias, which results from non-random patterns in modality
availability, and distribution bias, which arises from latent confounders that
influence both observed features and outcomes. To address these challenges, we
perform a structural causal analysis of the data-generating process and propose
a unified framework that is compatible with existing direct prediction-based
multimodal learning methods. Our method consists of two key components: (1) a
missingness deconfounding module that approximates causal intervention based on
backdoor adjustment and (2) a dual-branch neural network that explicitly
disentangles causal features from spurious correlations. We evaluated our
method in real-world public and in-hospital datasets, demonstrating its
effectiveness and causal insights.

Motivation: 神经架构搜索(NAS)是一个计算成本高昂的离散优化问题，搜索空间巨大且不平滑。现有的代理评估方法存在局限性，需要一种更高效的优化框架。

Method: 提出OptiProxy-NAS框架，使用代理表示将离散的NAS空间重新表述为连续、可微分和平滑的空间，使得任何可微分优化方法都可以应用于梯度搜索。

Conclusion: OptiProxy-NAS通过空间转换和梯度优化方法，为神经架构搜索提供了一个高效、灵活的端到端优化解决方案，在多个领域和任务中展现出优异性能。

Abstract: Neural architecture search (NAS) is a hard computationally expensive
optimization problem with a discrete, vast, and spiky search space. One of the
key research efforts dedicated to this space focuses on accelerating NAS via
certain proxy evaluations of neural architectures. Different from the prevalent
predictor-based methods using surrogate models and differentiable architecture
search via supernetworks, we propose an optimization proxy to streamline the
NAS as an end-to-end optimization framework, named OptiProxy-NAS. In
particular, using a proxy representation, the NAS space is reformulated to be
continuous, differentiable, and smooth. Thereby, any differentiable
optimization method can be applied to the gradient-based search of the relaxed
architecture parameters. Our comprehensive experiments on $12$ NAS tasks of $4$
search spaces across three different domains including computer vision, natural
language processing, and resource-constrained NAS fully demonstrate the
superior search results and efficiency. Further experiments on low-fidelity
scenarios verify the flexibility.

Method: 综合主动学习与无监督异常检测方法，提出基于动态时间扩张的差异性查询策略(DQS)选择性查询标签

Result: DQS在小预算场景下表现最好，其他策略在标签错误时更稳健，但所有主动学习策略都超过了无监督阈值方法

Conclusion: 在可能查询专家的情况下，建议采用基于主动学习的阈值设置方法，策略选择取决于专家知识和标签愿望

Abstract: Truly unsupervised approaches for time series anomaly detection are rare in
the literature. Those that exist suffer from a poorly set threshold, which
hampers detection performance, while others, despite claiming to be
unsupervised, need to be calibrated using a labelled data subset, which is
often not available in the real world. This work integrates active learning
with an existing unsupervised anomaly detection method by selectively querying
the labels of multivariate time series, which are then used to refine the
threshold selection process. To achieve this, we introduce a novel query
strategy called the dissimilarity-based query strategy (DQS). DQS aims to
maximise the diversity of queried samples by evaluating the similarity between
anomaly scores using dynamic time warping. We assess the detection performance
of DQS in comparison to other query strategies and explore the impact of
mislabelling, a topic that is underexplored in the literature. Our findings
indicate that DQS performs best in small-budget scenarios, though the others
appear to be more robust when faced with mislabelling. Therefore, in the real
world, the choice of query strategy depends on the expertise of the oracle and
the number of samples they are willing to label. Regardless, all query
strategies outperform the unsupervised threshold even in the presence of
mislabelling. Thus, whenever it is feasible to query an oracle, employing an
active learning-based threshold is recommended.

Abstract: Human Activity Recognition (HAR) using multimodal sensor data remains
challenging due to noisy or incomplete measurements, scarcity of labeled
examples, and privacy concerns. Traditional centralized deep learning
approaches are often constrained by infrastructure availability, network
latency, and data sharing restrictions. While federated learning (FL) addresses
privacy by training models locally and sharing only model parameters, it still
has to tackle issues arising from the use of heterogeneous multimodal data and
differential privacy requirements. In this article, a Graph-based Multimodal
Federated Learning framework, GraMFedDHAR, is proposed for HAR tasks. Diverse
sensor streams such as a pressure mat, depth camera, and multiple
accelerometers are modeled as modality-specific graphs, processed through
residual Graph Convolutional Neural Networks (GCNs), and fused via
attention-based weighting rather than simple concatenation. The fused
embeddings enable robust activity classification, while differential privacy
safeguards data during federated aggregation. Experimental results show that
the proposed MultiModalGCN model outperforms the baseline MultiModalFFN, with
up to 2 percent higher accuracy in non-DP settings in both centralized and
federated paradigms. More importantly, significant improvements are observed
under differential privacy constraints: MultiModalGCN consistently surpasses
MultiModalFFN, with performance gaps ranging from 7 to 13 percent depending on
the privacy budget and setting. These results highlight the robustness of
graph-based modeling in multimodal learning, where GNNs prove more resilient to
the performance degradation introduced by DP noise.

Conclusion: 该分布式训练方法通过数据并行和全解耦并行反向传播的结合，有效解决了深度神经网络训练时间过长的问题，提高了训练效率。

Abstract: Despite the notable success of deep neural networks (DNNs) in solving complex
tasks, the training process still remains considerable challenges. A primary
obstacle is the substantial time required for training, particularly as high
performing DNNs tend to become increasingly deep (characterized by a larger
number of hidden layers) and require extensive training datasets. To address
these challenges, this paper introduces a distributed training method that
integrates two prominent strategies for accelerating deep learning: data
parallelism and fully decoupled parallel backpropagation algorithm. By
utilizing multiple computational units operating in parallel, the proposed
approach enhances the amount of training data processed in each iteration while
mitigating locking issues commonly associated with the backpropagation
algorithm. These features collectively contribute to significant improvements
in training efficiency. The proposed distributed training method is rigorously
proven to converge to critical points under certain conditions. Its
effectiveness is further demonstrated through empirical evaluations, wherein an
DNN is trained to perform classification tasks on the CIFAR-10 dataset.

<details>

Motivation: 形态学感知机中的形态学算子不可微分，使得基于梯度的优化方法不适用于训练此类网络，需要寻找不依赖梯度信息的替代策略

Method: 将训练问题表述为凸函数之差(DC)形式，使用凸凹过程(CCP)迭代求解，产生一系列线性规划子问题

Result: 计算实验证明了所提出的训练方法在处理MPCL网络分类任务方面的有效性

Conclusion: CCP方法为训练不可微分的形态学感知机网络提供了一种有效的替代方案

Abstract: A morphological perceptron is a multilayer feedforward neural network in
which neurons perform elementary operations from mathematical morphology. For
multiclass classification tasks, a morphological perceptron with a competitive
layer (MPCL) is obtained by integrating a winner-take-all output layer into the
standard morphological architecture. The non-differentiability of morphological
operators renders gradient-based optimization methods unsuitable for training
such networks. Consequently, alternative strategies that do not depend on
gradient information are commonly adopted. This paper proposes the use of the
convex-concave procedure (CCP) for training MPCL networks. The training problem
is formulated as a difference of convex (DC) functions and solved iteratively
using CCP, resulting in a sequence of linear programming subproblems.
Computational experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
training method in addressing classification tasks with MPCL networks.

Abstract: How do we enable AI systems to efficiently learn in the real-world?
First-principles models are widely used to simulate natural systems, but often
fail to capture real-world complexity due to simplifying assumptions. In
contrast, deep learning approaches can estimate complex dynamics with minimal
assumptions but require large, representative datasets. We propose SimPEL, a
method that efficiently combines first-principles models with data-driven
learning by using low-fidelity simulators as priors in Bayesian deep learning.
This enables SimPEL to benefit from simulator knowledge in low-data regimes and
leverage deep learning's flexibility when more data is available, all the while
carefully quantifying epistemic uncertainty. We evaluate SimPEL on diverse
systems, including biological, agricultural, and robotic domains, showing
superior performance in learning complex dynamics. For decision-making, we
demonstrate that SimPEL bridges the sim-to-real gap in model-based
reinforcement learning. On a high-speed RC car task, SimPEL learns a highly
dynamic parking maneuver involving drifting with substantially less data than
state-of-the-art baselines. These results highlight the potential of SimPEL for
data-efficient learning and control in complex real-world environments.

Method: 在31个不同环境中进行实验，比较在线和离线代理的性能。分析离线代理性能下降的根本原因，并探索通过混合在线交互或探索数据来缓解问题的方法。

Result: 在线代理表现更优。离线代理遇到分布外状态问题，导致想象与现实滚动不匹配。通过混合在线交互或探索数据可以恢复性能，达到与在线训练相似的效果。

Conclusion: 建议在收集大型数据集时混入探索数据，而不仅仅依赖专家数据，以提高离线模型的性能和稳定性。

Abstract: Data collection is crucial for learning robust world models in model-based
reinforcement learning. The most prevalent strategies are to actively collect
trajectories by interacting with the environment during online training or
training on offline datasets. At first glance, the nature of learning
task-agnostic environment dynamics makes world models a good candidate for
effective offline training. However, the effects of online vs. offline data on
world models and thus on the resulting task performance have not been
thoroughly studied in the literature. In this work, we investigate both
paradigms in model-based settings, conducting experiments on 31 different
environments. First, we showcase that online agents outperform their offline
counterparts. We identify a key challenge behind performance degradation of
offline agents: encountering Out-Of-Distribution states at test time. This
issue arises because, without the self-correction mechanism in online agents,
offline datasets with limited state space coverage induce a mismatch between
the agent's imagination and real rollouts, compromising policy training. We
demonstrate that this issue can be mitigated by allowing for additional online
interactions in a fixed or adaptive schedule, restoring the performance of
online training with limited interaction data. We also showcase that
incorporating exploration data helps mitigate the performance degradation of
offline agents. Based on our insights, we recommend adding exploration data
when collecting large datasets, as current efforts predominantly focus on
expert data alone.

TL;DR: 通过在大规模社会科学实验数据集SocSci210上微调LLMs，显著提高了对人类行为模拟的准确性，在未见实验中预测准确率提升26%，优于GPT-4o 13%，并有效减少了人口统计偏差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用LLMs模拟社会科学实验结果，但现有模型在准确模拟人类行为方面存在局限，需要针对社会科学实验数据进行专门优化。

Method: 构建包含290万条响应数据的SocSci210数据集，涵盖210个开源社会科学实验，通过在个体层面响应数据上微调LLMs（特别是Qwen2.5-14B模型）。

Result: 微调后的Socrates-Qwen-14B模型在完全未见研究中预测准确率提升26%，优于GPT-4o 13%；在新条件下泛化能力提升71%；人口统计偏差减少10.6%。

Conclusion: 在特定领域社会科学数据上微调LLMs能够显著提高对人类行为的模拟准确性，为实验假设筛选提供更可靠的模拟工具。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) offer a powerful opportunity to simulate the
results of social science experiments. In this work, we demonstrate that
finetuning LLMs directly on individual-level responses from past experiments
meaningfully improves the accuracy of such simulations across diverse social
science domains. We construct SocSci210 via an automatic pipeline, a dataset
comprising 2.9 million responses from 400,491 participants in 210 open-source
social science experiments. Through finetuning, we achieve multiple levels of
generalization. In completely unseen studies, our strongest model,
Socrates-Qwen-14B, produces predictions that are 26% more aligned with
distributions of human responses to diverse outcome questions under varying
conditions relative to its base model (Qwen2.5-14B), outperforming GPT-4o by
13%. By finetuning on a subset of conditions in a study, generalization to new
unseen conditions is particularly robust, improving by 71%. Since SocSci210
contains rich demographic information, we reduce demographic parity, a measure
of bias, by 10.6% through finetuning. Because social sciences routinely
generate rich, topic-specific datasets, our findings indicate that finetuning
on such data could enable more accurate simulations for experimental hypothesis
screening. We release our data, models and finetuning code at

Abstract: Anomaly detection underpins critical applications from network security and
intrusion detection to fraud prevention, where recognizing aberrant patterns
rapidly is indispensable. Progress in this area is routinely impeded by two
obstacles: extreme class imbalance and the curse of dimensionality. To combat
the former, we previously introduced Precision-Recall Curve (PRC)
classification trees and their ensemble extension, the PRC Random Forest
(PRC-RF). Building on that foundation, we now propose a hybrid framework that
integrates PRC-RF with autoencoders, unsupervised machine learning methods that
learn compact latent representations, to confront both challenges
simultaneously. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmark datasets
demonstrate that the resulting Autoencoder-PRC-RF model achieves superior
accuracy, scalability, and interpretability relative to prior methods,
affirming its potential for high-stakes anomaly-detection tasks.

Method: 通过分析当前AI科学领域的现状，识别出四个相互关联的挑战：社区功能失调、研究重点与上游需求不匹配、数据碎片化和基础设施不平等，并探讨其文化组织根源。

Result: 提出了需要技术创新的同时，更需有意识的社区建设、跨学科教育、共享基准和可访问基础设施的综合解决方案框架。

Conclusion: 应该将AI科学重新定义为集体社会项目，将可持续协作和公平参与作为技术进步的前提条件，而不仅仅是技术工具的开发。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence promises to accelerate scientific discovery, yet its
benefits remain unevenly distributed. While technical obstacles such as scarce
data, fragmented standards, and unequal access to computation are significant,
we argue that the primary barriers are social and institutional. Narratives
that defer progress to speculative "AI scientists," the undervaluing of data
and infrastructure contributions, misaligned incentives, and gaps between
domain experts and machine learning researchers all constrain impact. We
highlight four interconnected challenges: community dysfunction, research
priorities misaligned with upstream needs, data fragmentation, and
infrastructure inequities. We argue that their roots lie in cultural and
organizational practices. Addressing them requires not only technical
innovation but also intentional community-building, cross-disciplinary
education, shared benchmarks, and accessible infrastructure. We call for
reframing AI for science as a collective social project, where sustainable
collaboration and equitable participation are treated as prerequisites for
technical progress.

Abstract: Energy forecasting is vital for grid reliability and operational efficiency.
Although recent advances in time series forecasting have led to progress,

that existing methods struggle on our dataset, which exhibits more complex and
non-stationary correlation dynamics. Our findings highlight key limitations of
current methods and offer a strong empirical basis for building more robust

Conclusion: DCV-ROOD框架为OOD检测方法提供了一种可靠的评估方法，能够更准确地估计模型在实际应用中的性能，有助于提升AI系统的稳健性和可靠性

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection plays a key role in enhancing the
robustness of artificial intelligence systems by identifying inputs that differ
significantly from the training distribution, thereby preventing unreliable
predictions and enabling appropriate fallback mechanisms. Developing reliable
OOD detection methods is a significant challenge, and rigorous evaluation of
these techniques is essential for ensuring their effectiveness, as it allows
researchers to assess their performance under diverse conditions and to
identify potential limitations or failure modes. Cross-validation (CV) has
proven to be a highly effective tool for providing a reasonable estimate of the
performance of a learning algorithm. Although OOD scenarios exhibit particular
characteristics, an appropriate adaptation of CV can lead to a suitable
evaluation framework for this setting. This work proposes a dual CV framework
for robust evaluation of OOD detection models, aimed at improving the
reliability of their assessment. The proposed evaluation framework aims to
effectively integrate in-distribution (ID) and OOD data while accounting for
their differing characteristics. To achieve this, ID data are partitioned using
a conventional approach, whereas OOD data are divided by grouping samples based
on their classes. Furthermore, we analyze the context of data with class
hierarchy to propose a data splitting that considers the entire class hierarchy
to obtain fair ID-OOD partitions to apply the proposed evaluation framework.
This framework is called Dual Cross-Validation for Robust Out-of-Distribution
Detection (DCV-ROOD). To test the validity of the evaluation framework, we
selected a set of state-of-the-art OOD detection methods, both with and without
outlier exposure. The results show that the method achieves very fast
convergence to the true performance.

Conclusion: ExoST框架成功解决了外生变量建模中的关键挑战，为时空预测提供了有效的解决方案

Abstract: Spatio-temporal forecasting aims to predict the future state of dynamic
systems and plays an important role in multiple fields. However, existing
solutions only focus on modeling using a limited number of observed target
variables. In real-world scenarios, exogenous variables can be integrated into
the model as additional input features and associated with the target signal to
promote forecast accuracy. Although promising, this still encounters two
challenges: the inconsistent effects of different exogenous variables to the
target system, and the imbalance effects between historical variables and
future variables. To address these challenges, this paper introduces \model, a
novel framework for modeling \underline{exo}genous variables in
\underline{s}patio-\underline{t}emporal forecasting, which follows a ``select,
then balance'' paradigm. Specifically, we first construct a latent space gated
expert module, where fused exogenous information is projected into a latent
space to dynamically select and recompose salient signals via specialized
sub-experts. Furthermore, we design a siamese network architecture in which
recomposed representations of past and future exogenous variables are fed into
dual-branch spatio-temporal backbones to capture dynamic patterns. The outputs
are integrated through a context-aware weighting mechanism to achieve dynamic
balance during the modeling process. Extensive experiments on real-world
datasets demonstrate the effectiveness, generality, robustness, and efficiency
of our proposed framework.

Motivation: 探索Transformer基础模型是否真正内部化了语义概念（如市场制度），而不仅仅是曲线拟合，以及是否能利用其内部表征模拟稀罕但高风险的市场崩盘事件。

Method: 提出激活移植技术，通过将某个事件（如历史崩盘）的统计矩征强制注入到另一个事件（如平静期）的隐藏状态中，实现对预测结果的因果干预操纵。

Result: 注入崩盘语义会导致下跌预测，注入平静语义则能压制崩盘并恢复稳定性。模型还编码了事件严重程度的等级概念，潜在向量模长与系统性震荡幅度直接相关。在Toto和Chronos两种不同架构的TSFM上验证有效。

Conclusion: 可操纵、语义基础的表征是大型时间序列Transformer的稳健特性。这些发现证明了一个潜在概念空间的存在，将可解释性从事后归因转向直接因果干预，为战略性压力测试提供了语义级别的"what-if"分析能力。

Abstract: While transformer-based foundation models excel at forecasting routine
patterns, two questions remain: do they internalize semantic concepts such as
market regimes, or merely fit curves? And can their internal representations be
leveraged to simulate rare, high-stakes events such as market crashes? To
investigate this, we introduce activation transplantation, a causal
intervention that manipulates hidden states by imposing the statistical moments
of one event (e.g., a historical crash) onto another (e.g., a calm period)
during the forward pass. This procedure deterministically steers forecasts:
injecting crash semantics induces downturn predictions, while injecting calm
semantics suppresses crashes and restores stability. Beyond binary control, we
find that models encode a graded notion of event severity, with the latent
vector norm directly correlating with the magnitude of systemic shocks.
Validated across two architecturally distinct TSFMs, Toto (decoder only) and
Chronos (encoder-decoder), our results demonstrate that steerable, semantically
grounded representations are a robust property of large time series
transformers. Our findings provide evidence for a latent concept space that
governs model predictions, shifting interpretability from post-hoc attribution
to direct causal intervention, and enabling semantic "what-if" analysis for
strategic stress-testing.

Abstract: It is widely recognized in modern machine learning practice that access to a
diverse set of tasks can enhance performance across those tasks. This
observation suggests that, unlike in general multi-objective optimization, the
objectives in many real-world settings may not be inherently conflicting. To
address this, prior work introduced the Aligned Multi-Objective Optimization
(AMOO) framework and proposed gradient-based algorithms with provable
convergence guarantees. However, existing analysis relies on strong
assumptions, particularly strong convexity, which implies the existence of a
unique optimal solution. In this work, we relax this assumption and study
gradient-descent algorithms for convex AMOO under standard smoothness or
Lipschitz continuity conditions-assumptions more consistent with those used in
deep learning practice. This generalization requires new analytical tools and
metrics to characterize convergence in the convex AMOO setting. We develop such
tools, propose scalable algorithms for convex AMOO, and establish their
convergence guarantees. Additionally, we prove a novel lower bound that
demonstrates the suboptimality of naive equal-weight approaches compared to our
methods.

Motivation: 共形预测被认为能够通过预测集大小来捕捉偶然不确定性，但缺乏实证证据支持。本研究旨在验证共形预测是否能够有效量化数据集中的类别重叠导致的固有歧义性

Method: 使用三种共形预测方法为八个深度学习模型生成预测集，涵盖四个包含多人标注的数据集。通过测量预测集大小与人类标注者分配的不同标签数量之间的相关性来评估效果

Result: 绝大多数共形预测输出与人类标注之间呈现非常弱到弱的相关性，只有少数显示中等相关性。虽然能提供更高的真实类别覆盖率，但捕捉偶然不确定性的能力有限

Conclusion: 需要重新审慎评估共形预测生成的预测集，虽然能保证覆盖率，但在量化偶然不确定性方面效果不佳，存在局限性

Abstract: Conformal prediction is a model-agnostic approach to generating prediction
sets that cover the true class with a high probability. Although its prediction
set size is expected to capture aleatoric uncertainty, there is a lack of
evidence regarding its effectiveness. The literature presents that prediction
set size can upper-bound aleatoric uncertainty or that prediction sets are
larger for difficult instances and smaller for easy ones, but a validation of
this attribute of conformal predictors is missing. This work investigates how
effectively conformal predictors quantify aleatoric uncertainty, specifically
the inherent ambiguity in datasets caused by overlapping classes. We perform
this by measuring the correlation between prediction set sizes and the number
of distinct labels assigned by human annotators per instance. We further assess
the similarity between prediction sets and human-provided annotations. We use
three conformal prediction approaches to generate prediction sets for eight
deep learning models trained on four datasets. The datasets contain annotations
from multiple human annotators (ranging from five to fifty participants) per
instance, enabling the identification of class overlap. We show that the vast
majority of the conformal prediction outputs show a very weak to weak
correlation with human annotations, with only a few showing moderate
correlation. These findings underscore the necessity of critically reassessing
the prediction sets generated using conformal predictors. While they can
provide a higher coverage of the true classes, their capability in capturing

Conclusion: 该基准为社区提供了评估和设计更鲁棒、公平和经济可行的去中心化梯度市场所必需的工具和实证依据。

Abstract: The rise of distributed and privacy-preserving machine learning has sparked
interest in decentralized gradient marketplaces, where participants trade
intermediate artifacts like gradients. However, existing Federated Learning
(FL) benchmarks overlook critical economic and systemic factors unique to such
marketplaces-cost-effectiveness, fairness to sellers, and market
stability-especially when a buyer relies on a private baseline dataset for
evaluation.
  We introduce a comprehensive benchmark framework to holistically evaluate
robust gradient aggregation methods within these buyer-baseline-reliant
marketplaces. Our contributions include: (1) a simulation environment modeling
marketplace dynamics with a variable buyer baseline and diverse seller
distributions; (2) an evaluation methodology augmenting standard FL metrics
with marketplace-centric dimensions such as Economic Efficiency, Fairness, and
Selection Dynamics; (3) an in-depth empirical analysis of the existing
Distributed Gradient Marketplace framework, MartFL, including the integration
and comparative evaluation of adapted FLTrust and SkyMask as alternative
aggregation strategies within it. This benchmark spans diverse datasets, local
attacks, and Sybil attacks targeting the marketplace selection process; and (4)
actionable insights into the trade-offs between model performance, robustness,
cost, fairness, and stability.
  This benchmark equips the community with essential tools and empirical
evidence to evaluate and design more robust, equitable, and economically viable
decentralized gradient marketplaces.

Conclusion: 该框架利用AI进步和数据可用性，向更自动化的数据驱动建模流程前进了一步

Abstract: While queueing network models are powerful tools for analyzing service
systems, they traditionally require substantial human effort and domain
expertise to construct. To make this modeling approach more scalable and
accessible, we propose a data-driven framework for queueing network modeling
and simulation based on autoregressive sequence models trained on event-stream
data. Instead of explicitly specifying arrival processes, service mechanisms,
or routing logic, our approach learns the conditional distributions of event
types and event times, recasting the modeling task as a problem of sequence
distribution learning. We show that Transformer-style architectures can
effectively parameterize these distributions, enabling automated construction
of high-fidelity simulators. As a proof of concept, we validate our framework
on event tables generated from diverse queueing networks, showcasing its
utility in simulation, uncertainty quantification, and counterfactual
evaluation. Leveraging advances in artificial intelligence and the growing
availability of data, our framework takes a step toward more automated,
data-driven modeling pipelines to support broader adoption of queueing network
models across service domains.

### [198] [The Measure of Deception: An Analysis of Data Forging in Machine Unlearning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05865)
*Rishabh Dixit,Yuan Hui,Rayan Saab*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文研究了机器学习遗忘中的对抗性伪造问题，分析了伪造数据集的度量特性，证明了在大多数情况下随机采样伪造点的概率极小，为检测虚假遗忘声明提供了理论依据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受隐私法规和消除有害数据影响的需求驱动，机器学习遗忘旨在修改训练模型以有效"忘记"指定数据。验证遗忘的关键挑战是对抗性伪造——恶意制作模仿目标点梯度的数据，造成已遗忘的假象而实际上未移除信息。

Method: 提出了一个分析框架，考虑梯度近似目标梯度在容差ε内的数据点集合（称为ε-伪造集）。对于线性回归和单层神经网络，分析了该集合的Lebesgue度量；在一般正则性假设下，证明了伪造集度量随ε^{(d-r)/2}衰减，其中d是数据维度，r是模型梯度变分矩阵的零度。

Result: 研究表明伪造集的度量很小，按ε的量级缩放，当ε足够小时为ε^d。在非退化数据分布下，随机采样伪造点的可能性极小。扩展至批量SGD和几乎处处平滑损失函数得到相同的渐近缩放。

Conclusion: 对抗性伪造从根本上受到限制，虚假的遗忘声明原则上可以被检测。这些结果为验证机器学习遗忘提供了理论保证，表明通过梯度分析可以有效识别未真正遗忘的情况。

Abstract: Motivated by privacy regulations and the need to mitigate the effects of
harmful data, machine unlearning seeks to modify trained models so that they
effectively ``forget'' designated data. A key challenge in verifying unlearning
is forging -- adversarially crafting data that mimics the gradient of a target
point, thereby creating the appearance of unlearning without actually removing
information. To capture this phenomenon, we consider the collection of data
points whose gradients approximate a target gradient within tolerance
$\epsilon$ -- which we call an $\epsilon$-forging set -- and develop a
framework for its analysis. For linear regression and one-layer neural
networks, we show that the Lebesgue measure of this set is small. It scales on
the order of $\epsilon$, and when $\epsilon$ is small enough, $\epsilon^d$.
More generally, under mild regularity assumptions, we prove that the forging
set measure decays as $\epsilon^{(d-r)/2}$, where $d$ is the data dimension and
$r<d$ is the nullity of a variation matrix defined by the model gradients.
Extensions to batch SGD and almost-everywhere smooth loss functions yield the
same asymptotic scaling. In addition, we establish probability bounds showing
that, under non-degenerate data distributions, the likelihood of randomly
sampling a forging point is vanishingly small. These results provide evidence
that adversarial forging is fundamentally limited and that false unlearning
claims can, in principle, be detected.

Motivation: 高保真度流体力学模拟液态金属强循环流传热耗时计算成本高，需要更高效的预测方法

Method: 首先使用核机器器和浅层神经网络，然后采用自监督神经网络和迁移学习方法，在损失函数中加入物理知识权重调节

Result: 自监督神经网络成功预测钠流体传热系数，误差约±8%，单独使用物理知识预测误差4-10%，其他机器学习方法预测误差主要在±8%以内

Conclusion: 机器学习模型为液态金属冷却微型散热器的设计和优化提供了高效的备选方案，充分结合物理知识的预测方法显著提高了预测精度

Abstract: A surrogate model is developed to predict the convective heat transfer
coefficient of liquid sodium (Na) flow within rectangular miniature heat sinks.
Initially, kernel-based machine learning techniques and shallow neural network
are applied to a dataset with 87 Nusselt numbers for liquid sodium in
rectangular miniature heat sinks. Subsequently, a self-supervised
physics-informed neural network and transfer learning approach are used to
increase the estimation performance. In the self-supervised physics-informed
neural network, an additional layer determines the weight the of physics in the
loss function to balance data and physics based on their uncertainty for a
better estimation. For transfer learning, a shallow neural network trained on
water is adapted for use with Na. Validation results show that the
self-supervised physics-informed neural network successfully estimate the heat
transfer rates of Na with an error margin of approximately +8%. Using only
physics for regression, the error remains between 5% to 10%. Other machine
learning methods specify the prediction mostly within +8%. High-fidelity
modeling of turbulent forced convection of liquid metals using computational
fluid dynamics (CFD) is both time-consuming and computationally expensive.
Therefore, machine learning based models offer a powerful alternative tool for
the design and optimization of liquid-metal-cooled miniature heat sinks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM-based Text-to-SQL方法往往忽视数据库模式信息的重要性，而研究发现模式信息在生成高质量SQL查询中起着关键甚至主导作用。

Method: 提出包含两个组件的数据库模式专家：1）X-Linking - 基于LLM监督微调的Schema Linking方法；2）X-Admin - 专注于Schema Understanding，弥合抽象模式信息与自然语言问题之间的差距。同时采用多LLM策略提升系统性能。

Result: 在Spider-Dev数据集上达到84.9%的执行准确率，在Spider-Test数据集上达到82.5%的执行准确率，成为基于开源模型的领先Text-to-SQL框架。

Conclusion: X-SQL通过有效利用数据库模式信息，显著提升了Text-to-SQL任务的性能，证明了模式信息在此类任务中的关键作用。

Abstract: With Large Language Models' (LLMs) emergent abilities on code generation
tasks, Text-to-SQL has become one of the most popular downstream applications.
Despite the strong results of multiple recent LLM-based Text-to-SQL frameworks,
the research community often overlooks the importance of database schema
information for generating high-quality SQL queries. We find that such schema
information plays a significant or even dominant role in the Text-to-SQL task.
To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel database schema expert with two
components. We first introduce X-Linking, an LLM Supervised Finetuning
(SFT)-based method that achieves superior Schema Linking results compared to
existing open-source Text-to-SQL methods. In addition, we innovatively propose
an X-Admin component that focuses on Schema Understanding by bridging the gap
between abstract schema information and the user's natural language question.
Aside from better learning with schema information, we experiment with
Multi-LLMs for different components within the system to further boost its
performance. By incorporating these techniques into our end-to-end framework,
X-SQL, we have achieved Execution Accuracies of 84.9% on the Spider-Dev dataset
and 82.5% on the Spider-Test dataset. This outstanding performance establishes
X-SQL as the leading Text-to-SQL framework based on open-source models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现实世界中在线决策的不确定性问题，特别是在AI集群工作负载调度等场景中，需要平衡长期服务协议和突发需求。

Method: 首先提出BEST算法提供可证明的竞争保证，然后引入CoRT学习增强变体，整合不可信的黑盒预测来改进决策过程。

Result: 理论分析显示CoRT在预测准确时优于BEST，同时在任意预测错误下保持鲁棒性。案例研究验证了算法在平衡轨迹跟踪、决策平滑性和抗干扰能力方面的有效性。

Conclusion: SOOTT框架和相应算法为处理在线优化中的多目标权衡提供了有效解决方案，特别是在结合机器学习预测时能显著提升性能。

Abstract: We introduce the Smoothed Online Optimization for Target Tracking (SOOTT)
problem, a new framework that integrates three key objectives in online
decision-making under uncertainty: (1) tracking cost for following a
dynamically moving target, (2) adversarial perturbation cost for withstanding
unpredictable disturbances, and (3) switching cost for penalizing abrupt
changes in decisions. This formulation captures real-world scenarios such as
elastic and inelastic workload scheduling in AI clusters, where operators must
balance long-term service-level agreements (e.g., LLM training) against sudden
demand spikes (e.g., real-time inference). We first present BEST, a robust
algorithm with provable competitive guarantees for SOOTT. To enhance practical
performance, we introduce CoRT, a learning-augmented variant that incorporates
untrusted black-box predictions (e.g., from ML models) into its decision
process. Our theoretical analysis shows that CoRT strictly improves over BEST
when predictions are accurate, while maintaining robustness under arbitrary
prediction errors. We validate our approach through a case study on workload
scheduling, demonstrating that both algorithms effectively balance trajectory
tracking, decision smoothness, and resilience to external disturbances.

TL;DR: 提出了统一交互基础模型(UIFM)，采用复合标记化方法将多属性事件作为语义连贯单元处理，解决了传统模型在序列化事件时丢失关键上下文的问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于自然语言的基础模型无法理解电信、电商和金融等领域中结构化交互的整体性，通过将事件序列化为文本会分解成语义碎片，丢失重要上下文

Method: 采用复合标记化原则，将每个多属性事件视为单一语义连贯单元，学习用户行为的底层"语法"，感知完整的交互而非离散数据流

Result: 该架构不仅更准确，而且代表了创建更适应性和智能预测系统的根本性进步

Conclusion: UIFM模型是真正行为理解的基础模型，能够更好地理解和预测复杂、演化的事件序列，为构建更智能的AI系统迈出了重要一步

Abstract: A central goal of artificial intelligence is to build systems that can
understand and predict complex, evolving sequences of events. However, current
foundation models, designed for natural language, fail to grasp the holistic
nature of structured interactions found in domains like telecommunications,
e-commerce and finance. By serializing events into text, they disassemble them
into semantically fragmented parts, losing critical context. In this work, we
introduce the Unified Interaction Foundation Model (UIFM), a foundation model
engineered for genuine behavioral understanding. At its core is the principle
of composite tokenization, where each multi-attribute event is treated as a
single, semantically coherent unit. This allows UIFM to learn the underlying
"grammar" of user behavior, perceiving entire interactions rather than a
disconnected stream of data points. We demonstrate that this architecture is
not just more accurate, but represents a fundamental step towards creating more
adaptable and intelligent predictive systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统MARL需要大量样本和计算资源，且策略缺乏可解释性，LLM在单智能体任务中成功生成程序化策略的启发

Method: 包含全局池、局部池、策略规划器和轨迹批评器四个模块的迭代框架，通过LLM生成和优化程序化策略

Result: 显著减少对环境交互的依赖，以最小交互实现高性能策略

Conclusion: PolicyEvolve为多玩家游戏提供了一种高效、可解释的程序化策略生成通用框架

Abstract: Multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has achieved significant progress
in solving complex multi-player games through self-play. However, training
effective adversarial policies requires millions of experience samples and
substantial computational resources. Moreover, these policies lack
interpretability, hindering their practical deployment. Recently, researchers
have successfully leveraged Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate
programmatic policies for single-agent tasks, transforming neural network-based
policies into interpretable rule-based code with high execution efficiency.
Inspired by this, we propose PolicyEvolve, a general framework for generating
programmatic policies in multi-player games. PolicyEvolve significantly reduces
reliance on manually crafted policy code, achieving high-performance policies
with minimal environmental interactions. The framework comprises four modules:
Global Pool, Local Pool, Policy Planner, and Trajectory Critic. The Global Pool
preserves elite policies accumulated during iterative training. The Local Pool
stores temporary policies for the current iteration; only sufficiently
high-performing policies from this pool are promoted to the Global Pool. The
Policy Planner serves as the core policy generation module. It samples the top
three policies from the Global Pool, generates an initial policy for the
current iteration based on environmental information, and refines this policy
using feedback from the Trajectory Critic. Refined policies are then deposited
into the Local Pool. This iterative process continues until the policy achieves
a sufficiently high average win rate against the Global Pool, at which point it
is integrated into the Global Pool. The Trajectory Critic analyzes interaction
data from the current policy, identifies vulnerabilities, and proposes
directional improvements to guide the Policy Planner

Conclusion: ARIES是首个建立时间序列数据属性与建模策略关系的研究，同时实现了可解释的模型推荐系统

Abstract: Recent advancements in deep learning models for time series forecasting have
been significant. These models often leverage fundamental time series
properties such as seasonality and non-stationarity, which may suggest an
intrinsic link between model performance and data properties. However, existing
benchmark datasets fail to offer diverse and well-defined temporal patterns,
restricting the systematic evaluation of such connections. Additionally, there
is no effective model recommendation approach, leading to high time and cost
expenditures when testing different architectures across different downstream
applications. For those reasons, we propose ARIES, a framework for assessing
relation between time series properties and modeling strategies, and for
recommending deep forcasting models for realistic time series. First, we
construct a synthetic dataset with multiple distinct patterns, and design a
comprehensive system to compute the properties of time series. Next, we conduct
an extensive benchmarking of over 50 forecasting models, and establish the
relationship between time series properties and modeling strategies. Our
experimental results reveal a clear correlation. Based on these findings, we
propose the first deep forecasting model recommender, capable of providing
interpretable suggestions for real-world time series. In summary, ARIES is the
first study to establish the relations between the properties of time series
data and modeling strategies, while also implementing a model recommendation
system. The code is available at: https://github.com/blisky-li/ARIES.

Motivation: 有限元方法在大型高温超导磁体设计中计算成本高、耗时长，限制了快速设计能力，需要开发高效准确的替代计算方法。

Method: 使用全连接残差神经网络(FCRN)构建代理模型，通过有限元模拟生成训练数据集，比较不同网络深度和神经元配置的性能。

Conclusion: 提出的FCRN代理模型在保证精度的同时显著提高了计算效率，为大规模高温超导磁体的快速分析提供了有前景的工具。

Abstract: Finite element method (FEM) is widely used in high-temperature
superconducting (HTS) magnets, but its computational cost increases with magnet
size and becomes time-consuming for meter-scale magnets, especially when
multi-physics couplings are considered, which limits the fast design of
large-scale REBCO magnet systems. In this work, a surrogate model based on a
fully connected residual neural network (FCRN) is developed to predict the
space-time current density distribution in REBCO solenoids. Training datasets
were generated from FEM simulations with varying numbers of turns and pancakes.
The results demonstrate that, for deeper networks, the FCRN architecture
achieves better convergence than conventional fully connected network (FCN),
with the configuration of 12 residual blocks and 256 neurons per layer
providing the most favorable balance between training accuracy and
generalization capability. Extrapolation studies show that the model can
reliably predict magnetization losses for up to 50% beyond the training range,
with maximum errors below 10%. The surrogate model achieves predictions several
orders of magnitude faster than FEM and still remains advantageous when
training costs are included. These results indicate that the proposed
FCRN-based surrogate model provides both accuracy and efficiency, offering a
promising tool for the rapid analysis of large-scale HTS magnets.

Abstract: Time-inconsistent preferences, where agents favor smaller-sooner over
larger-later rewards, are a key feature of human and animal decision-making.
Quasi-Hyperbolic (QH) discounting provides a simple yet powerful model for this
behavior, but its integration into the reinforcement learning (RL) framework
has been limited. This paper addresses key theoretical and algorithmic gaps for
precommitted agents with QH preferences. We make two primary contributions: (i)
we formally characterize the structure of the optimal policy, proving for the
first time that it reduces to a simple one-step non-stationary form; and (ii)
we design the first practical, model-free algorithms for both policy evaluation
and Q-learning in this setting, both with provable convergence guarantees. Our
results provide foundational insights for incorporating QH preferences in RL.

Abstract: Beginning with text and images, generative AI has expanded to audio, video,
computer code, and molecules. Yet, if generative AI is the answer, what is the
question? We explore the foundations of generation as a distinct machine
learning task with connections to prediction, compression, and decision-making.
We survey five major generative model families: autoregressive models,
variational autoencoders, normalizing flows, generative adversarial networks,
and diffusion models. We then introduce a probabilistic framework that
emphasizes the distinction between density estimation and generation. We review
a game-theoretic framework with a two-player adversary-learner setup to study
generation. We discuss post-training modifications that prepare generative
models for deployment. We end by highlighting some important topics in socially
responsible generation such as privacy, detection of AI-generated content, and
copyright and IP. We adopt a task-first framing of generation, focusing on what
generation is as a machine learning problem, rather than only on how models
implement it.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统神经算子需要大量训练数据且在稀缩数据时表现差，同时很多方法没有显式编码物理进化的因果关系和时间局部性结构，自回归模型存在错误累积问题

Method: 采用图神经网模拟器(GNS)框架，结合消息传递图神经网组织与显式数值时间步进方案，通过学习瞬时时间导数来建立准确的前向模型，并提出PCA+KMeans轨迹选择策略提高低数据性能

Result: 在2D Burgers方程、2D耦合Burgers方程和2D Allen-Cahn方程上，GNS仅需30个训练样本(总数据的3%)就能达到小于1%的相对L2误差，缩短了82.48%的自回归错误(相对FNO AR)和99.86%的错误(相对DON AR)，显著提高了数据效率和汇聚准确性

Conclusion: 结合图基局部归纳偏置与传统时间积分器可以构建准确、物理一致且可扩展的代用模型用于时间依赖性PDE模拟

Abstract: Neural operators (NOs) approximate mappings between infinite-dimensional
function spaces but require large datasets and struggle with scarce training
data. Many NO formulations don't explicitly encode causal, local-in-time
structure of physical evolution. While autoregressive models preserve causality
by predicting next time-steps, they suffer from rapid error accumulation. We
employ Graph Neural Simulators (GNS) - a message-passing graph neural network
framework - with explicit numerical time-stepping schemes to construct accurate
forward models that learn PDE solutions by modeling instantaneous time
derivatives. We evaluate our framework on three canonical PDE systems: (1) 2D
Burgers' scalar equation, (2) 2D coupled Burgers' vector equation, and (3) 2D
Allen-Cahn equation. Rigorous evaluations demonstrate GNS significantly
improves data efficiency, achieving higher generalization accuracy with
substantially fewer training trajectories compared to neural operator baselines
like DeepONet and FNO. GNS consistently achieves under 1% relative L2 errors
with only 30 training samples out of 1000 (3% of available data) across all
three PDE systems. It substantially reduces error accumulation over extended
temporal horizons: averaged across all cases, GNS reduces autoregressive error
by 82.48% relative to FNO AR and 99.86% relative to DON AR. We introduce a
PCA+KMeans trajectory selection strategy enhancing low-data performance.
Results indicate combining graph-based local inductive biases with conventional
time integrators yields accurate, physically consistent, and scalable surrogate
models for time-dependent PDEs.

Abstract: The field of human activity recognition has evolved significantly, driven
largely by advancements in Internet of Things (IoT) device technology,
particularly in personal devices. This study investigates the use of
ultra-wideband (UWB) technology for tracking inhabitant paths in home
environments using deep learning models. UWB technology estimates user
locations via time-of-flight and time-difference-of-arrival methods, which are
significantly affected by the presence of walls and obstacles in real
environments, reducing their precision. To address these challenges, we propose
a fingerprinting-based approach utilizing received signal strength indicator
(RSSI) data collected from inhabitants in two flats (60 m2 and 100 m2) while
performing daily activities. We compare the performance of convolutional neural
network (CNN), long short-term memory (LSTM), and hybrid CNN+LSTM models, as
well as the use of Bluetooth technology. Additionally, we evaluate the impact
of the type and duration of the temporal window (future, past, or a combination
of both). Our results demonstrate a mean absolute error close to 50 cm,
highlighting the superiority of the hybrid model in providing accurate location
estimates, thus facilitating its application in daily human activity
recognition in residential settings.

TL;DR: 提出一种基于参数化模板的近似计算方法，通过布尔重写技术减少神经网络中算术运算器的面积，在相同精度损失下实现比现有技术更好的面积节省


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在边缘设备上部署神经网络需要在推理能耗和分类精度之间取得平衡，近似计算通过略微降低算术运算器精度来减少能耗

Method: 改进XPAT布尔重写技术，提出基于参数化乘积共享的新型模板，将模板参数作为合成面积的代理指标

Result: 实验证明该方法能更好地收敛到低面积解决方案，相比原始XPAT和其他两种最先进方法能找到更好的近似方案

Conclusion: 所提出的参数化模板方法在神经网络算术运算器近似计算方面优于现有技术，为边缘设备部署提供了更有效的面积-精度权衡方案

Abstract: Deploying neural networks on edge devices entails a careful balance between
the energy required for inference and the accuracy of the resulting
classification. One technique for navigating this tradeoff is approximate
computing: the process of reducing energy consumption by slightly reducing the
accuracy of arithmetic operators. In this context, we propose a methodology to
reduce the area of the small arithmetic operators used in neural networks -
i.e., adders and multipliers - via a small loss in accuracy, and show that we
improve area savings for the same accuracy loss w.r.t. the state of the art. To
achieve our goal, we improve on a boolean rewriting technique recently
proposed, called XPAT, where the use of a parametrisable template to rewrite
circuits has proved to be highly beneficial. In particular, XPAT was able to
produce smaller circuits than comparable approaches while utilising a naive sum
of products template structure. In this work, we show that template parameters
can act as proxies for chosen metrics and we propose a novel template based on
parametrisable product sharing that acts as a close proxy to synthesised area.
We demonstrate experimentally that our methodology converges better to low-area
solutions and that it can find better approximations than both the original
XPAT and two other state-of-the-art approaches.

Motivation: 城市分析面临数据粒度、异质性和多模态的挑战，现有可视化工具很少探索融合数据是否能比单独数据源提供更深入的洞察

Method: 开发可视化辅助框架，比较融合潜在数据表示与单独表示在发现城市数据模式方面的效果

Result: 融合潜在表示产生更结构化的模式，而单独表示在特定情况下有用

Conclusion: 融合潜在数据表示在城市数据分析中通常更有效，但单独表示在某些场景下仍有价值

Abstract: Urban analytics utilizes extensive datasets with diverse urban information to
simulate, predict trends, and uncover complex patterns within cities. While
these data enables advanced analysis, it also presents challenges due to its
granularity, heterogeneity, and multimodality. To address these challenges,
visual analytics tools have been developed to support the exploration of latent
representations of fused heterogeneous and multimodal data, discretized at a
street-level of detail. However, visualization-assisted tools seldom explore
the extent to which fused data can offer deeper insights than examining each
data source independently within an integrated visualization framework. In this
work, we developed a visualization-assisted framework to analyze whether fused
latent data representations are more effective than separate representations in
uncovering patterns from dynamic and static urban data. The analysis reveals
that combined latent representations produce more structured patterns, while
separate ones are useful in particular cases.

*Chuang Niu,Ge Wang*

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于推理语言模型（RLM）的个性化肺癌风险评估方法，整合影像学发现和纵向医疗记录，显著提升了肺癌筛查风险预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前Lung-RADS系统仅基于肺结节特征进行风险分层，存在敏感性和特异性之间的权衡问题，需要整合多种风险因素进行更精准的个性化风险评估。

Method: 通过数据集构建与蒸馏、监督微调、强化学习和综合评估的系统研究，开发推理语言模型将风险评价任务分解为子组件，分析不同风险因素的贡献，并通过数据驱动的系统方程合成最终风险评分。

Result: 在国家肺癌筛查试验数据集上显著提升了风险预测性能，改善了预测准确性和可监测性。

Conclusion: 该方法通过思维链推理过程促进了肺癌筛查的临床转化，为个性化肺癌风险评估提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate risk assessment in lung cancer screening is critical for enabling
early cancer detection and minimizing unnecessary invasive procedures. The Lung
CT Screening Reporting and Data System (Lung-RADS) has been widely used as the
standard framework for patient management and follow-up. Nevertheless,
Lung-RADS faces trade-offs between sensitivity and specificity, as it
stratifies risk solely based on lung nodule characteristics without
incorporating various risk factors. Here we propose a reasoning language model
(RLM) to integrate radiology findings with longitudinal medical records for
individualized lung cancer risk assessment. Through a systematic study
including dataset construction and distillation, supervised fine-tuning,
reinforcement learning, and comprehensive evaluation, our model makes
significant improvements in risk prediction performance on datasets in the
national lung screening trial. Notably, RLM can decompose the risk evaluation
task into sub-components, analyze the contributions of diverse risk factors,
and synthesize them into a final risk score computed using our data-driven
system equation. Our approach improves both predictive accuracy and
monitorability through the chain of thought reasoning process, thereby
facilitating clinical translation into lung cancer screening.

Abstract: We investigate reinforcement learning in the Game Of Hidden Rules (GOHR)
environment, a complex puzzle in which an agent must infer and execute hidden
rules to clear a 6$\times$6 board by placing game pieces into buckets. We
explore two state representation strategies, namely Feature-Centric (FC) and
Object-Centric (OC), and employ a Transformer-based Advantage Actor-Critic
(A2C) algorithm for training. The agent has access only to partial observations
and must simultaneously infer the governing rule and learn the optimal policy
through experience. We evaluate our models across multiple rule-based and
trial-list-based experimental setups, analyzing transfer effects and the impact
of representation on learning efficiency.

Result: 在公开数据集上的大量实验表明，该框架在各种聚类指标上优于现有方法，同时严格保证了隐私性。

Conclusion: 该方法成功解决了差分隐私图聚类中的关键挑战，在保持隐私保护的同时显著提升了聚类性能和可解释性，为该领域的进一步发展提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Graph clustering under the framework of differential privacy, which aims to
process graph-structured data while protecting individual privacy, has been
receiving increasing attention. Despite significant achievements in current
research, challenges such as high noise, low efficiency and poor
interpretability continue to severely constrain the development of this field.
In this paper, we construct a differentially private and interpretable graph
clustering approach based on metric embedding initialization. Specifically, we
construct an SDP optimization, extract the key set and provide a
well-initialized clustering configuration using an HST-based initialization
method. Subsequently, we apply an established k-median clustering strategy to
derive the cluster results and offer comparative explanations for the query set
through differences from the cluster centers. Extensive experiments on public
datasets demonstrate that our proposed framework outperforms existing methods
in various clustering metrics while strictly ensuring privacy.

TL;DR: 本文提出了UrbanMIMOMap数据集，这是一个基于高精度射线追踪生成的大规模城市MIMO CSI数据集，为6G环境感知通信提供高质量训练数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 6G系统需要环境感知通信，但现有公开数据集主要关注SISO和路径损耗等有限信息，无法满足先进MIMO系统对详细信道状态信息的需求。

Method: 使用高精度射线追踪技术生成大规模城市MIMO CSI数据集，提供密集空间网格上的复杂CSI矩阵。

Result: 创建了UrbanMIMOMap数据集，包含全面的复杂CSI矩阵，超越了传统的路径损耗数据，为高保真无线电地图构建提供了基础资源。

Conclusion: 该工作为高精度无线电地图生成、MIMO空间性能和6G环境感知的机器学习研究提供了关键数据集和参考基准。

Abstract: Sixth generation (6G) systems require environment-aware communication, driven
by native artificial intelligence (AI) and integrated sensing and communication
(ISAC). Radio maps (RMs), providing spatially continuous channel information,
are key enablers. However, generating high-fidelity RM ground truth via
electromagnetic (EM) simulations is computationally intensive, motivating
machine learning (ML)-based RM construction. The effectiveness of these
data-driven methods depends on large-scale, high-quality training data. Current
public datasets often focus on single-input single-output (SISO) and limited
information, such as path loss, which is insufficient for advanced multi-input
multi-output (MIMO) systems requiring detailed channel state information (CSI).
To address this gap, this paper presents UrbanMIMOMap, a novel large-scale
urban MIMO CSI dataset generated using high-precision ray tracing. UrbanMIMOMap
offers comprehensive complex CSI matrices across a dense spatial grid, going
beyond traditional path loss data. This rich CSI is vital for constructing
high-fidelity RMs and serves as a fundamental resource for data-driven RM
generation, including deep learning. We demonstrate the dataset's utility
through baseline performance evaluations of representative ML methods for RM
construction. This work provides a crucial dataset and reference for research
in high-precision RM generation, MIMO spatial performance, and ML for 6G
environment awareness. The code and data for this work are available at:

Motivation: 解决在大规模商业系统中路由查询到最具成本效益的LLM同时保持响应质量的基本挑战，优化性能-成本权衡。

Method: 采用模块化架构，包含轻量级质量估计器（基于150万标注提示训练）、用户控制的容忍度参数路由机制，以及使用冻结编码器和模型特定适配器的可扩展设计。

Result: 在主要云平台上部署后，IPR实现了43.9%的成本降低，同时保持与Claude家族最强模型的质量相当，处理请求延迟低于150ms。

Conclusion: IPR框架通过智能路由和质量约束机制，有效解决了LLM部署中的成本-质量权衡问题，具有实际工业应用价值。

Abstract: Routing incoming queries to the most cost-effective LLM while maintaining
response quality poses a fundamental challenge in optimizing performance-cost
trade-offs for large-scale commercial systems. We present IPR\, a
quality-constrained Intelligent Prompt Routing framework that dynamically
selects optimal models based on predicted response quality and user-specified
tolerance levels. IPR introduces three key innovations: (1) a modular
architecture with lightweight quality estimators trained on 1.5M prompts
annotated with calibrated quality scores, enabling fine-grained quality
prediction across model families; (2) a user-controlled routing mechanism with
tolerance parameter $\tau \in [0,1]$ that provides explicit control over
quality-cost trade-offs; and (3) an extensible design using frozen encoders
with model-specific adapters, reducing new model integration from days to
hours. To rigorously train and evaluate IPR, we curate an industrial-level
dataset IPRBench\footnote{IPRBench will be released upon legal approval.}, a
comprehensive benchmark containing 1.5 million examples with response quality
annotations across 11 LLM candidates. Deployed on a major cloud platform, IPR
achieves 43.9\% cost reduction while maintaining quality parity with the
strongest model in the Claude family and processes requests with sub-150ms
latency.

Motivation: 个性化推荐面临稀疏交互、快速内容更新和异构文本信号的挑战，需要结合语言模型和协同过滤的优势

Method: 使用冻结LLM加轻量适配器生成文本条件嵌入，LightGCN学习协同嵌入，通过对称对比目标对齐两个视图，采用层内门控融合

Result: 在Yelp和Amazon-Electronics数据集上，所有8个指标均达到最佳结果，相对改进最高达+4.53%(Recall@40)和+4.01%(NDCG@40)

Conclusion: 跨视图对齐是必要的，门控融合优于后期融合和纯LLM变体，语言模型在冷启动/长尾场景中主导，图结构在其他场景中稳定排序

Abstract: Personalization is a core capability across consumer technologies, streaming,
shopping, wearables, and voice, yet it remains challenged by sparse
interactions, fast content churn, and heterogeneous textual signals. We present
RecMind, an LLM-enhanced graph recommender that treats the language model as a
preference prior rather than a monolithic ranker. A frozen LLM equipped with
lightweight adapters produces text-conditioned user/item embeddings from
titles, attributes, and reviews; a LightGCN backbone learns collaborative
embeddings from the user-item graph. We align the two views with a symmetric
contrastive objective and fuse them via intra-layer gating, allowing language
to dominate in cold/long-tail regimes and graph structure to stabilize rankings
elsewhere. On Yelp and Amazon-Electronics, RecMind attains the best results on
all eight reported metrics, with relative improvements up to +4.53\%
(Recall@40) and +4.01\% (NDCG@40) over strong baselines. Ablations confirm both
the necessity of cross-view alignment and the advantage of gating over late
fusion and LLM-only variants.

Conclusion: 该方法能够扩展到SoC级别的测试策略优化，适合集成到下游电子设计自动化流程中，为量化风险评估提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Silent Data Errors (SDEs) from time-zero defects and aging degrade
safety-critical systems. Functional testing detects SDE-related faults but is
expensive to simulate. We present a unified spatio-temporal graph convolutional
network (ST-GCN) for fast, accurate prediction of long-cycle fault impact
probabilities (FIPs) in large sequential circuits, supporting quantitative risk
assessment. Gate-level netlists are modeled as spatio-temporal graphs to
capture topology and signal timing; dedicated spatial and temporal encoders
predict multi-cycle FIPs efficiently. On ISCAS-89 benchmarks, the method
reduces simulation time by more than 10x while maintaining high accuracy (mean
absolute error 0.024 for 5-cycle predictions). The framework accepts features
from testability metrics or fault simulation, allowing efficiency-accuracy
trade-offs. A test-point selection study shows that choosing observation points
by predicted FIPs improves detection of long-cycle, hard-to-detect faults. The
approach scales to SoC-level test strategy optimization and fits downstream
electronic design automation flows.

TL;DR: LoaQ是一种针对层级后训练量化的输出近似方法，通过目标输出级一致性来更好地实现模型量化直觉，具有闭式解且与现有技术正交，可轻松集成到现有量化流程中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的层级后训练量化方法采用局部视图，只能实现权重的激活感知近似，导致近似不足且与原始输出存在偏差。需要更准确地近似全模型输出。

Method: 基于对主流LLM结构特征的深入理解，提出LoaQ方法，明确以输出级一致性为目标，采用闭式解实现更好的输出对齐。

Result: 在LLaMA和Qwen模型家族上的实验表明，LoaQ在仅权重量化和权重-激活联合量化中都表现有效，能进一步提升整体量化质量。

Conclusion: LoaQ与现有量化策略无缝集成，具有推动后训练量化前沿的强潜力，更好地实现了量化近似原始输出的核心直觉。

Abstract: A natural and intuitive idea in model quantization is to approximate each
component's quantized output to match its original. Layer-wise post-training
quantization (PTQ), though based on this idea, adopts a strictly local view and
can achieve, at best, only activation-aware approximations of weights. As a
result, it often leads to insufficient approximations and practical deviations
from this guiding intuition. Recent work has achieved a more accurate
approximation of linear-layer outputs within the framework of layer-wise PTQ,
but such refinements remain inadequate for achieving alignment with the full
model output. Based on a deeper understanding of the structural characteristics
of mainstream LLMs, we propose $LoaQ$, an output-approximation method for
layer-wise PTQ that explicitly targets output-level consistency. It better
aligns with this intuition and can feature a simple closed-form solution,
making it orthogonal to existing techniques and readily integrable into
existing quantization pipelines. Experiments on the LLaMA and Qwen model
families demonstrate that LoaQ performs effectively in both weight-only and
weight-activation joint quantization. By integrating seamlessly with existing
quantization strategies, it further enhances overall quantization quality and
shows strong potential to advance the frontier of post-training quantization.

Motivation: 现有数据驱动方法要么无法泛化到其他站点，要么难以融入能源领域特定数据，需要专门针对风电预测设计的基础模型。

Method: 采用离散化-生成框架：专用时间序列分词器将连续多变量观测转换为离散分层token，然后使用仅解码器Transformer在126,000多个站点的1500亿时间步数据上进行自回归预训练。

Conclusion: WindFM展示了学习表示的鲁棒性和可迁移性，为风电预测提供了有效的轻量级基础模型解决方案。

Abstract: High-quality wind power forecasting is crucial for the operation of modern
power grids. However, prevailing data-driven paradigms either train a
site-specific model which cannot generalize to other locations or rely on
fine-tuning of general-purpose time series foundation models which are
difficult to incorporate domain-specific data in the energy sector. This paper
introduces WindFM, a lightweight and generative Foundation Model designed
specifically for probabilistic wind power forecasting. WindFM employs a
discretize-and-generate framework. A specialized time-series tokenizer first
converts continuous multivariate observations into discrete, hierarchical
tokens. Subsequently, a decoder-only Transformer learns a universal
representation of wind generation dynamics by autoregressively pre-training on
these token sequences. Using the comprehensive WIND Toolkit dataset comprising
approximately 150 billion time steps from more than 126,000 sites, WindFM
develops a foundational understanding of the complex interplay between
atmospheric conditions and power output. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
our compact 8.1M parameter model achieves state-of-the-art zero-shot
performance on both deterministic and probabilistic tasks, outperforming
specialized models and larger foundation models without any fine-tuning. In
particular, WindFM exhibits strong adaptiveness under out-of-distribution data
from a different continent, demonstrating the robustness and transferability of
its learned representations. Our pre-trained model is publicly available at
https://github.com/shiyu-coder/WindFM.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的冗余指数rho(C)来直接量化潜在表示中的维度间依赖性，通过分析耦合矩阵并与正态分布比较来评估表示质量，实验证明低冗余指数与高性能相关


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度网络常产生冗余的潜在空间，多个坐标编码重叠信息，降低有效容量并阻碍泛化。标准指标如准确率或重建损失只能提供间接证据，无法直接隔离冗余问题

Method: 引入冗余指数rho(C)，通过分析潜在表示的耦合矩阵，将其非对角线统计量与正态分布通过能量距离进行比较，得到紧凑、可解释且统计基础良好的表示质量度量

Result: 在MNIST变体、Fashion-MNIST、CIFAR-10和CIFAR-100上验证，低rho(C)可靠预测高分类准确率或低重建误差，高冗余与性能崩溃相关。TPE优先探索低rho区域

Conclusion: rho(C)揭示了冗余作为跨模型和任务的通用瓶颈，为评估和改进学习表示的效率提供了理论视角和实用工具，可指导神经架构搜索并作为冗余感知的正则化目标

Abstract: A central challenge in representation learning is constructing latent
embeddings that are both expressive and efficient. In practice, deep networks
often produce redundant latent spaces where multiple coordinates encode
overlapping information, reducing effective capacity and hindering
generalization. Standard metrics such as accuracy or reconstruction loss
provide only indirect evidence of such redundancy and cannot isolate it as a
failure mode. We introduce a redundancy index, denoted rho(C), that directly
quantifies inter-dimensional dependencies by analyzing coupling matrices
derived from latent representations and comparing their off-diagonal statistics
against a normal distribution via energy distance. The result is a compact,
interpretable, and statistically grounded measure of representational quality.
We validate rho(C) across discriminative and generative settings on MNIST
variants, Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100, spanning multiple
architectures and hyperparameter optimization strategies. Empirically, low
rho(C) reliably predicts high classification accuracy or low reconstruction
error, while elevated redundancy is associated with performance collapse.
Estimator reliability grows with latent dimension, yielding natural lower
bounds for reliable analysis. We further show that Tree-structured Parzen
Estimators (TPE) preferentially explore low-rho regions, suggesting that rho(C)
can guide neural architecture search and serve as a redundancy-aware
regularization target. By exposing redundancy as a universal bottleneck across
models and tasks, rho(C) offers both a theoretical lens and a practical tool
for evaluating and improving the efficiency of learned representations.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated emergent in-context learning
(ICL) capabilities across a range of tasks, including zero-shot time-series
forecasting. We show that text-trained foundation models can accurately
extrapolate spatiotemporal dynamics from discretized partial differential
equation (PDE) solutions without fine-tuning or natural language prompting.
Predictive accuracy improves with longer temporal contexts but degrades at
finer spatial discretizations. In multi-step rollouts, where the model
recursively predicts future spatial states over multiple time steps, errors
grow algebraically with the time horizon, reminiscent of global error
accumulation in classical finite-difference solvers. We interpret these trends
as in-context neural scaling laws, where prediction quality varies predictably
with both context length and output length. To better understand how LLMs are
able to internally process PDE solutions so as to accurately roll them out, we
analyze token-level output distributions and uncover a consistent ICL
progression: beginning with syntactic pattern imitation, transitioning through
an exploratory high-entropy phase, and culminating in confident, numerically
grounded predictions.

TL;DR: 机器学习结合域特定增强技术能够准确分类自由文本餐记录是否符合营养目标，效果超过自我评估


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在利用机器学习和域特定增强技术来分析患者生成的健康数据（自由文本餐记录），以分类餐饮是否符合不同的营养目标

Method: 使用过　3000个餐饮记录数据集，采用TFIDF和BERT文本嵌入、领域特定增强信息（本体论、成分解析器、宏量营养素内容），评估逻辑回归和多层感知机分类器的性能

Result: 即使没有增强，机器学习效果也超过个人自我评估；最佳的ML分类器组合增强技术达到更高准确度；解析成分、食物实体和宏量营养素增强效果良好

Conclusion: 机器学习能够利用非结构化自由文本餐记录可靠地分类餐饮是否符合特定营养目标，特别是统合营养领域知识时效果更佳，为精准医疗中的患者个体化营养指导提供支持

Abstract: This study examined the use of machine learning and domain specific
enrichment on patient generated health data, in the form of free text meal
logs, to classify meals on alignment with different nutritional goals. We used
a dataset of over 3000 meal records collected by 114 individuals from a
diverse, low income community in a major US city using a mobile app. Registered
dietitians provided expert judgement for meal to goal alignment, used as gold
standard for evaluation. Using text embeddings, including TFIDF and BERT, and
domain specific enrichment information, including ontologies, ingredient
parsers, and macronutrient contents as inputs, we evaluated the performance of
logistic regression and multilayer perceptron classifiers using accuracy,
precision, recall, and F1 score against the gold standard and self assessment.
Even without enrichment, ML outperformed self assessments of individuals who
logged meals, and the best performing combination of ML classifier with
enrichment achieved even higher accuracies. In general, ML classifiers with
enrichment of Parsed Ingredients, Food Entities, and Macronutrients information
performed well across multiple nutritional goals, but there was variability in
the impact of enrichment and classification algorithm on accuracy of
classification for different nutritional goals. In conclusion, ML can utilize
unstructured free text meal logs and reliably classify whether meals align with
specific nutritional goals, exceeding self assessments, especially when
incorporating nutrition domain knowledge. Our findings highlight the potential
of ML analysis of patient generated health data to support patient centered
nutrition guidance in precision healthcare.

Motivation: 探究大型语言模型数值推理的鲁棒性，评估其在从基础运算到组合谜题等不同复杂度数学问题上的表现

Method: 测试多个最先进的LLM智能体在100个问题挑战上的表现，问题分为四类：基础算术、高级运算、素数检查、24点数字谜题

Result: 智能体在前三类需要确定性算法执行的任务上准确率高，但在需要启发式搜索组合空间的24点谜题上持续失败

Conclusion: LLM智能体的熟练度主要局限于回忆和执行已知算法，而非生成性解决问题，其数值推理更像是复杂模式匹配而非灵活的分析思维

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable emergent
capabilities, yet the robustness of their numerical reasoning remains an open
question. While standard benchmarks evaluate LLM reasoning on complex problem
sets using aggregated metrics, they often obscure foundational weaknesses. In
this work, we probe LLM mathematical numeracy by evaluating performance on
problems of escalating complexity, from constituent operations to combinatorial
puzzles. We test several state-of-the-art LLM-based agents on a 100-problem
challenge comprising four categories: (1) basic arithmetic, (2) advanced
operations, (3) primality checking, and (4) the Game of 24 number puzzle. Our
results show that while the agents achieved high accuracy on the first three
categories, which require deterministic algorithmic execution, they
consistently failed at the number puzzle, underlining its demand for a
heuristic search over a large combinatorial space to be a significant
bottleneck. These findings reveal that the agents' proficiency is largely
confined to recalling and executing known algorithms, rather than performing
generative problem-solving. This suggests their apparent numerical reasoning is
more akin to sophisticated pattern-matching than flexible, analytical thought,
limiting their potential for tasks that require novel or creative numerical
insights.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Ban&Pick是一种无需重新训练的后训练策略，通过识别和强化关键专家（Pick）以及动态剪枝冗余专家（Ban），在保持模型架构不变的情况下提升MoE模型性能并加速推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的MoE模型在预训练阶段路由器过早收敛并强制平衡使用专家，导致高影响力专家利用不足和固定激活专家数量带来的冗余问题，限制了模型性能和效率的潜力。

Method: 提出Ban&Pick后训练策略：Pick组件发现并强化对性能影响大的关键专家群体；Ban组件根据层和token敏感度动态剪枝冗余专家。该方法无需重新训练模型或改变MoE架构。

Result: 在DeepSeek和Qwen3等细粒度MoE-LLM上的实验显示，在数学、代码和通用推理基准测试中均取得显著性能提升和推理加速。例如Qwen3-30B-A3B在AIME2024上准确率从80.67%提升到84.66%，在GPQA-Diamond上从65.66%提升到68.18%，推理速度提升1.25倍。

Conclusion: Ban&Pick作为一种即插即用的后训练策略，能够在不重新训练或改变架构的情况下为MoE模型带来免费的性能增益和推理加速，解决了现有MoE路由中的关键问题。

Abstract: Sparse Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) has become a key architecture for scaling
large language models (LLMs) efficiently. Recent fine-grained MoE designs
introduce hundreds of experts per layer, with multiple experts activated per
token, enabling stronger specialization. However, during pre-training, routers
are optimized mainly for stability and robustness: they converge prematurely
and enforce balanced usage, limiting the full potential of model performance
and efficiency. In this work, we uncover two overlooked issues: (i) a few
highly influential experts are underutilized due to premature and balanced
routing decisions; and (ii) enforcing a fixed number of active experts per
token introduces substantial redundancy. Instead of retraining models or
redesigning MoE architectures, we introduce Ban&Pick, a post-training,
plug-and-play strategy for smarter MoE routing. Pick discovers and reinforces
key experts-a small group with outsized impact on performance-leading to
notable accuracy gains across domains. Ban complements this by dynamically
pruning redundant experts based on layer and token sensitivity, delivering
faster inference with minimal accuracy loss. Experiments on fine-grained
MoE-LLMs (DeepSeek, Qwen3) across math, code, and general reasoning benchmarks
demonstrate that Ban&Pick delivers free performance gains and inference
acceleration without retraining or architectural changes. For instance, on
Qwen3-30B-A3B, it improves accuracy from 80.67 to 84.66 on AIME2024 and from
65.66 to 68.18 on GPQA-Diamond, while accelerating inference by 1.25x under the
vLLM.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在大数据时代，从高维数据中选择关键变量变得越来越重要。稀疏回归通过促进模型简洁性和可解释性成为有力工具，但现有方法在高度稀疏场景下的表现有待提升。

Method: 改进基于统计物理的变分门控(VG)方法，引入显式特征选择自旋变量，利用变分推断推导可处理的损失函数，并整合现代自动微分技术实现可扩展的优化。

Result: VG在高度稀疏场景下表现优异，比Ridge和LASSO回归提供更一致稳健的变量选择。研究发现当引入多余变量时，泛化性能会急剧下降，选择变量的不确定性增加，这一转变点可用于估计相关变量的正确数量。

Conclusion: VG方法在稀疏建模方面具有强大潜力，可广泛应用于压缩感知和机器学习中的模型剪枝等领域，为高维数据变量选择提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Selecting key variables from high-dimensional data is increasingly important
in the era of big data. Sparse regression serves as a powerful tool for this
purpose by promoting model simplicity and explainability. In this work, we
revisit a valuable yet underutilized method, the statistical physics-based
Variational Garrote (VG), which introduces explicit feature selection spin
variables and leverages variational inference to derive a tractable loss
function. We enhance VG by incorporating modern automatic differentiation
techniques, enabling scalable and efficient optimization. We evaluate VG on
both fully controllable synthetic datasets and complex real-world datasets. Our
results demonstrate that VG performs especially well in highly sparse regimes,
offering more consistent and robust variable selection than Ridge and LASSO
regression across varying levels of sparsity. We also uncover a sharp
transition: as superfluous variables are admitted, generalization degrades
abruptly and the uncertainty of the selection variables increases. This
transition point provides a practical signal for estimating the correct number
of relevant variables, an insight we successfully apply to identify key
predictors in real-world data. We expect that VG offers strong potential for
sparse modeling across a wide range of applications, including compressed
sensing and model pruning in machine learning.

Method: 采用知识蒸馏框架，教师模型基于历史服务中数据训练，指导学生模型（服务前数据训练）。引入多粒度蒸馏策略（粗粒度、细粒度和自蒸馏）来对齐表示和预测，并使用重加权策略缓解少数类偏差

Conclusion: MGKD框架成功整合了服务中行为数据，通过知识蒸馏和多粒度策略显著提升了服务前风险评估性能，为解决金融风险管理中的跨阶段数据利用问题提供了有效方案

Abstract: Typical financial risk management involves distinct phases for pre-service
risk assessment and in-service default detection, often modeled separately.
This paper proposes a novel framework, Multi-Granularity Knowledge Distillation
(abbreviated as MGKD), aimed at improving pre-service risk prediction through
the integration of in-service user behavior data. MGKD follows the idea of
knowledge distillation, where the teacher model, trained on historical
in-service data, guides the student model, which is trained on pre-service
data. By using soft labels derived from in-service data, the teacher model
helps the student model improve its risk prediction prior to service
activation. Meanwhile, a multi-granularity distillation strategy is introduced,
including coarse-grained, fine-grained, and self-distillation, to align the
representations and predictions of the teacher and student models. This
approach not only reinforces the representation of default cases but also
enables the transfer of key behavioral patterns associated with defaulters from
the teacher to the student model, thereby improving the overall performance of
pre-service risk assessment. Moreover, we adopt a re-weighting strategy to
mitigate the model's bias towards the minority class. Experimental results on
large-scale real-world datasets from Tencent Mobile Payment demonstrate the
effectiveness of our proposed approach in both offline and online scenarios.

Motivation: 传统深度学习方法通过惩罚项处理QoS约束缺乏理论收敛保证，在实际场景中经常无法满足服务质量要求，需要一种理论上有保证的可扩展解决方案。

Method: 1) 扩展WMMSE算法到多信道QoS约束场景(eWMMSE)；2) 开发支持多信道分配的GNN算法JCPGNN-M；3) 提出GNN与拉格朗日对偶优化结合的理论框架，确保约束满足和收敛性。

Result: JCPGNN-M在性能上匹配eWMMSE，同时在推理速度、大规模网络泛化能力和不完美信道信息下的鲁棒性方面有显著提升。

Conclusion: 该工作为未来无线网络的约束资源分配提供了一个可扩展且理论上有保证的解决方案，结合了传统优化方法和深度学习方法的优势。

Abstract: Meeting minimum data rate constraints is a significant challenge in wireless
communication systems, particularly as network complexity grows. Traditional
deep learning approaches often address these constraints by incorporating
penalty terms into the loss function and tuning hyperparameters empirically.
However, this heuristic treatment offers no theoretical convergence guarantees
and frequently fails to satisfy QoS requirements in practical scenarios.
Building upon the structure of the WMMSE algorithm, we first extend it to a
multi-channel setting with QoS constraints, resulting in the enhanced WMMSE
(eWMMSE) algorithm, which is provably convergent to a locally optimal solution
when the problem is feasible. To further reduce computational complexity and
improve scalability, we develop a GNN-based algorithm, JCPGNN-M, capable of
supporting simultaneous multi-channel allocation per user. To overcome the
limitations of traditional deep learning methods, we propose a principled
framework that integrates GNN with a Lagrangian-based primal-dual optimization
method. By training the GNN within the Lagrangian framework, we ensure
satisfaction of QoS constraints and convergence to a stationary point.
Extensive simulations demonstrate that JCPGNN-M matches the performance of
eWMMSE while offering significant gains in inference speed, generalization to
larger networks, and robustness under imperfect channel state information. This
work presents a scalable and theoretically grounded solution for constrained
resource allocation in future wireless networks.

Abstract: On-device deep learning models have extensive real world demands. Deep
learning compilers efficiently compile models into executables for deployment
on edge devices, but these executables may face the threat of reverse
engineering. Previous studies have attempted to decompile DNN executables, but
they face challenges in handling compilation optimizations and analyzing
quantized compiled models. In this paper, we present NeuroDeX to unlock diverse
support in decompiling DNN executables. NeuroDeX leverages the semantic
understanding capabilities of LLMs along with dynamic analysis to accurately
and efficiently perform operator type recognition, operator attribute recovery
and model reconstruction. NeuroDeX can recover DNN executables into high-level
models towards compilation optimizations, different architectures and quantized
compiled models. We conduct experiments on 96 DNN executables across 12 common

decompile non-quantized executables into nearly identical high-level models.
NeuroDeX can recover functionally similar high-level models for quantized

Abstract: Time series anomaly detection (TSAD) is a vital yet challenging task,
particularly in scenarios where labeled anomalies are scarce and temporal
dependencies are complex. Recent anomaly assumption (AA) approaches alleviate
the lack of anomalies by injecting synthetic samples and training
discriminative models. Despite promising results, these methods often suffer
from two fundamental limitations: patchy generation, where scattered anomaly
knowledge leads to overly simplistic or incoherent anomaly injection, and
Anomaly Shift, where synthetic anomalies either resemble normal data too
closely or diverge unrealistically from real anomalies, thereby distorting
classification boundaries. In this paper, we propose CAPMix, a controllable
anomaly augmentation framework that addresses both issues. First, we design a
CutAddPaste mechanism to inject diverse and complex anomalies in a targeted
manner, avoiding patchy generation. Second, we introduce a label revision
strategy to adaptively refine anomaly labels, reducing the risk of anomaly
shift. Finally, we employ dual-space mixup within a temporal convolutional
network to enforce smoother and more robust decision boundaries. Extensive
experiments on five benchmark datasets, including AIOps, UCR, SWaT, WADI, and
ESA, demonstrate that CAPMix achieves significant improvements over
state-of-the-art baselines, with enhanced robustness against contaminated
training data. The code is available at https://github.com/alsike22/CAPMix.

Abstract: Antibody binding site prediction plays a pivotal role in computational
immunology and therapeutic antibody design. Existing sequence or structure
methods rely on single-view features and fail to identify antibody-specific
binding sites on the antigens-a dual limitation in representation and
prediction. In this paper, we propose CAME-AB, a novel Cross-modality Attention
framework with a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) backbone for robust antibody binding
site prediction. CAME-AB integrates five biologically grounded modalities,
including raw amino acid encodings, BLOSUM substitution profiles, pretrained
language model embeddings, structure-aware features, and GCN-refined
biochemical graphs-into a unified multimodal representation. To enhance
adaptive cross-modal reasoning, we propose an adaptive modality fusion module
that learns to dynamically weight each modality based on its global relevance
and input-specific contribution. A Transformer encoder combined with an MoE
module further promotes feature specialization and capacity expansion. We
additionally incorporate a supervised contrastive learning objective to
explicitly shape the latent space geometry, encouraging intra-class compactness
and inter-class separability. To improve optimization stability and
generalization, we apply stochastic weight averaging during training. Extensive
experiments on benchmark antibody-antigen datasets demonstrate that CAME-AB
consistently outperforms strong baselines on multiple metrics, including
Precision, Recall, F1-score, AUC-ROC, and MCC. Ablation studies further
validate the effectiveness of each architectural component and the benefit of
multimodal feature integration. The model implementation details and the codes

Abstract: The wide spreading of Internet of Things (IoT) sensors generates vast
spatio-temporal data streams, but ensuring data credibility is a critical yet
unsolved challenge for applications like smart homes. While spatio-temporal
graph (STG) models are a leading paradigm for such data, they often fall short
in dynamic, human-centric environments due to two fundamental limitations: (1)
their reliance on static graph topologies, which fail to capture physical,
event-driven dynamics, and (2) their tendency to confuse spurious correlations
with true causality, undermining robustness in human-centric environments. To
address these gaps, we propose the Dynamic Causal Spatio-Temporal Graph Network
(DyC-STG), a novel framework designed for real-time data credibility analysis
in IoT. Our framework features two synergistic contributions: an event-driven
dynamic graph module that adapts the graph topology in real-time to reflect
physical state changes, and a causal reasoning module to distill causally-aware
representations by strictly enforcing temporal precedence. To facilitate the
research in this domain we release two new real-world datasets. Comprehensive
experiments show that DyC-STG establishes a new state-of-the-art, outperforming
the strongest baselines by 1.4 percentage points and achieving an F1-Score of
up to 0.930.

Abstract: The excess Gibbs energy plays a central role in chemical engineering and
chemistry, providing a basis for modeling the thermodynamic properties of
liquid mixtures. Predicting the excess Gibbs energy of multi-component mixtures
solely from the molecular structures of their components is a long-standing
challenge. In this work, we address this challenge by integrating physical laws
as hard constraints within a flexible neural network. The resulting model,
HANNA, was trained end-to-end on an extensive experimental dataset for binary
mixtures from the Dortmund Data Bank, guaranteeing thermodynamically consistent
predictions. A novel surrogate solver developed in this work enabled the
inclusion of liquid-liquid equilibrium data in the training process.
Furthermore, a geometric projection method was applied to enable robust
extrapolations to multi-component mixtures, without requiring additional
parameters. We demonstrate that HANNA delivers excellent predictions, clearly
outperforming state-of-the-art benchmark methods in accuracy and scope. The
trained model and corresponding code are openly available, and an interactive

Result: 闭式WGAN参数在高斯和拉普拉斯分布数据下均表现出良好的收敛行为；与r-PCA解决方案相比，所提切片WGAN方法能达到相同性能但计算资源需求更少。

Conclusion: 该研究突破了LQG设置的限制，为WGAN在更广泛设置下的参数选择提供了理论指导和实用解决方案，特别是在高维非高斯数据场景中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: The generative adversarial network (GAN) aims to approximate an unknown
distribution via a parameterized neural network (NN). While GANs have been
widely applied in reinforcement and semisupervised learning as well as computer
vision tasks, selecting their parameters often needs an exhaustive search and
only a few selection methods can be proved to be theoretically optimal. One of
the most promising GAN variants is the Wasserstein GAN (WGAN). Prior work on
optimal parameters for WGAN is limited to the linear-quadratic-Gaussian (LQG)
setting, where the NN is linear and the data is Gaussian. In this paper, we
focus on the characterization of optimal WGAN parameters beyond the LQG
setting. We derive closed-form optimal parameters for one-dimensional WGANs
when the NN has non-linear activation functions and the data is non-Gaussian.
To extend this to high-dimensional WGANs, we adopt the sliced Wasserstein
framework and replace the constraint on marginal distributions of the randomly
projected data by a constraint on the joint distribution of the original
(unprojected) data. We show that the linear generator can be asymptotically
optimal for sliced WGAN with non-Gaussian data. Empirical studies show that our
closed-form WGAN parameters have good convergence behavior with data under both
Gaussian and Laplace distributions. Also, compared to the r principal component
analysis (r-PCA) solution, our proposed solution for sliced WGAN can achieve
the same performance while requiring less computational resources.

*Zongheng Guo,Tao Chen,Manuela Ferrario*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: QualityFM是一个用于PPG和ECG生理信号质量评估的多模态基础模型，通过大规模预训练和双轨架构设计，解决了信号质量差导致的误报警问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ICU和手术室中PPG和ECG信号质量差、不完整和不一致的问题导致误报警和诊断不准确，现有方法泛化性有限且需要大量标注数据。

Method: 采用双轨架构处理不同质量的配对生理信号，使用自蒸馏策略，集成窗口稀疏注意力机制的Transformer模型，结合蒸馏损失和重建损失的复合损失函数。

Result: 在超过2100万个30秒波形和17.9万小时数据上预训练了三个模型（9.6M到319M参数），在室性心动过速误报警、房颤识别和动脉血压估计三个临床任务上验证了有效性。

Conclusion: QualityFM通过大规模预训练和创新的架构设计，为生理信号质量评估提供了通用的基础模型，具有良好的跨任务迁移能力和实用价值。

Abstract: Photoplethysmogram (PPG) and electrocardiogram (ECG) are commonly recorded in
intesive care unit (ICU) and operating room (OR). However, the high incidence
of poor, incomplete, and inconsistent signal quality, can lead to false alarms
or diagnostic inaccuracies. The methods explored so far suffer from limited
generalizability, reliance on extensive labeled data, and poor cross-task
transferability. To overcome these challenges, we introduce QualityFM, a novel
multimodal foundation model for these physiological signals, designed to
acquire a general-purpose understanding of signal quality. Our model is
pre-trained on an large-scale dataset comprising over 21 million 30-second
waveforms and 179,757 hours of data. Our approach involves a dual-track
architecture that processes paired physiological signals of differing quality,
leveraging a self-distillation strategy where an encoder for high-quality
signals is used to guide the training of an encoder for low-quality signals. To
efficiently handle long sequential signals and capture essential local
quasi-periodic patterns, we integrate a windowed sparse attention mechanism
within our Transformer-based model. Furthermore, a composite loss function,
which combines direct distillation loss on encoder outputs with indirect
reconstruction loss based on power and phase spectra, ensures the preservation
of frequency-domain characteristics of the signals. We pre-train three models
with varying parameter counts (9.6 M to 319 M) and demonstrate their efficacy
and practical value through transfer learning on three distinct clinical tasks:
false alarm of ventricular tachycardia detection, the identification of atrial
fibrillation and the estimation of arterial blood pressure (ABP) from PPG and
ECG signals.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前车道变换意图预测研究大多在单一数据集上训练，缺乏对模型泛化能力的验证，需要测试模型在不同人群数据集上的表现。

Method: 使用transformer模型在两个不同数据集（德国和香港收集的数据）上进行车道变换意图预测测试，比较单数据集训练和跨数据集训练的性能。

Result: 模型在跨数据集测试时准确率大幅下降至39.43%，但在同时使用两个数据集训练时准确率可达86.71%。

Conclusion: 车道变换意图预测模型存在严重的泛化问题，需要在多样化数据集上进行训练以确保实际应用中的可靠性。

Abstract: As a result of the growing importance of lane change intention prediction for
a safe and efficient driving experience in complex driving scenarios,
researchers have in recent years started to train novel machine learning
algorithms on available datasets with promising results. A shortcoming of this
recent research effort, though, is that the vast majority of the proposed
algorithms are trained on a single datasets. In doing so, researchers failed to
test if their algorithm would be as effective if tested on a different dataset
and, by extension, on a different population with respect to the one on which
they were trained. In this article we test a transformer designed for lane
change intention prediction on two datasets collected by LevelX in Germany and
Hong Kong. We found that the transformer's accuracy plummeted when tested on a
population different to the one it was trained on with accuracy values as low
as 39.43%, but that when trained on both populations simultaneously it could
achieve an accuracy as high as 86.71%. - This work has been submitted to the

Motivation: CAGE-2是计算机网络防御领域的标准测试环境，当前已有多种防御方法，需要构建正式模型来定义和学习最优防御策略

Method: 使用部分可观测马尔可夫决策过程(POMDP)构建CAGE-2正式模型，基于PPO算法开发BF-PPO方法，利用粒子过滤降低大状态空间带来的计算复杂度

Result: 在CAGE-2 CybORG环境中评估，BF-PPO在学习到的防御策略和所需训练时间方面都超过了排名榜首位的CARDIFF方法

Conclusion: 通过POMDP正式模型化和BF-PPO方法，成功实现了更高效的CAGE-2防御策略学习，为网络安全领域提供了更优秀的解决方案

Abstract: CAGE-2 is an accepted benchmark for learning and evaluating defender
strategies against cyberattacks. It reflects a scenario where a defender agent
protects an IT infrastructure against various attacks. Many defender methods
for CAGE-2 have been proposed in the literature. In this paper, we construct a
formal model for CAGE-2 using the framework of Partially Observable Markov
Decision Process (POMDP). Based on this model, we define an optimal defender
strategy for CAGE-2 and introduce a method to efficiently learn this strategy.
Our method, called BF-PPO, is based on PPO, and it uses particle filter to
mitigate the computational complexity due to the large state space of the
CAGE-2 model. We evaluate our method in the CAGE-2 CybORG environment and
compare its performance with that of CARDIFF, the highest ranked method on the
CAGE-2 leaderboard. We find that our method outperforms CARDIFF regarding the
learned defender strategy and the required training time.

*John Tolladay,Beth Albert,Gabriel Davis Jones*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 这篇论文开发了一种可解释的监督变分自编码器模型，用于基于孕期结果对胎儿心电图信号进行分类，在保持竞争性预测性能的同时提供部分临床意义特征编码。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决当前深度学习方法在胎儿心电图分析中的可解释性限制问题，开发能够同时进行信号重建和结果预测的可解释模型。

Method: 使用OxMat CTG数据集训练监督变分自编码器，在五分钟胎儿心率段落上进行训练。模型包含Kullback-Leibler散度和总相关约束来结构潜在空间，并使用AUROC和MSE评估性能。

Result: 模型在段落级别和CTG级别分别获得0.752和0.779的AUROC。改进重建和分类性能。潜在空间分析显示基线相关特征得到良好表征，但短期和长期变异性特征编码较弱。

Conclusion: 监督VAE模型能够在胎儿结果预测中达到竞争性性能，并部分编码具有临床意义的CTG特征。虽然未完全实现可解释性，但为未来可解释生成模型奠定了基础。

Abstract: Objective: To develop and interpret a supervised variational autoencoder
(VAE) model for classifying cardiotocography (CTG) signals based on pregnancy
outcomes, addressing interpretability limits of current deep learning
approaches. Methods: The OxMat CTG dataset was used to train a VAE on
five-minute fetal heart rate (FHR) segments, labeled with postnatal outcomes.
The model was optimised for signal reconstruction and outcome prediction,
incorporating Kullback-Leibler divergence and total correlation (TC)
constraints to structure the latent space. Performance was evaluated using area
under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) and mean squared
error (MSE). Interpretability was assessed using coefficient of determination,
latent traversals and unsupervised component analyses. Results: The model
achieved an AUROC of 0.752 at the segment level and 0.779 at the CTG level,
where predicted scores were aggregated. Relaxing TC constraints improved both
reconstruction and classification. Latent analysis showed that baseline-related
features (e.g., FHR baseline, baseline shift) were well represented and aligned
with model scores, while metrics like short- and long-term variability were
less strongly encoded. Traversals revealed clear signal changes for baseline
features, while other properties were entangled or subtle. Unsupervised
decompositions corroborated these patterns. Findings: This work demonstrates
that supervised VAEs can achieve competitive fetal outcome prediction while
partially encoding clinically meaningful CTG features. The irregular,
multi-timescale nature of FHR signals poses challenges for disentangling
physiological components, distinguishing CTG from more periodic signals such as
ECG. Although full interpretability was not achieved, the model supports
clinically useful outcome prediction and provides a basis for future
interpretable, generative models.

Conclusion: CLAN通过创新的负面视图构建方式，提高了网络入侵检测的性能和效率，为实际应用提供了更实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Network intrusion detection remains a critical challenge in cybersecurity.
While supervised machine learning models achieve state-of-the-art performance,
their reliance on large labelled datasets makes them impractical for many
real-world applications. Anomaly detection methods, which train exclusively on
benign traffic to identify malicious activity, suffer from high false positive
rates, limiting their usability. Recently, self-supervised learning techniques
have demonstrated improved performance with lower false positive rates by
learning discriminative latent representations of benign traffic. In
particular, contrastive self-supervised models achieve this by minimizing the
distance between similar (positive) views of benign traffic while maximizing it
between dissimilar (negative) views. Existing approaches generate positive
views through data augmentation and treat other samples as negative. In
contrast, this work introduces Contrastive Learning using Augmented Negative
pairs (CLAN), a novel paradigm for network intrusion detection where augmented
samples are treated as negative views - representing potentially malicious
distributions - while other benign samples serve as positive views. This
approach enhances both classification accuracy and inference efficiency after
pretraining on benign traffic. Experimental evaluation on the Lycos2017 dataset
demonstrates that the proposed method surpasses existing self-supervised and
anomaly detection techniques in a binary classification task. Furthermore, when
fine-tuned on a limited labelled dataset, the proposed approach achieves
superior multi-class classification performance compared to existing
self-supervised models.

Conclusion: 该框架为复杂动态非线性系统建模提供了可扩展的理论基础，解释了结构化残差学习的经验优势，包括改进的泛化能力、减少的参数数量和更低的训练成本。

Abstract: Dynamic nonlinear systems exhibit distortions arising from coupled static and
dynamic effects. Their intertwined nature poses major challenges for
data-driven modeling. This paper presents a theoretical framework grounded in
structured decomposition, variance analysis, and task-centric complexity
bounds.
  The framework employs a directional lower bound on interactions between
measurable system components, extending orthogonality in inner product spaces
to structurally asymmetric settings. This bound supports variance inequalities
for decomposed systems. Key behavioral indicators are introduced along with a
memory finiteness index. A rigorous power-based condition establishes a
measurable link between finite memory in realizable systems and the First Law
of Thermodynamics. This offers a more foundational perspective than classical
bounds based on the Second Law.
  Building on this foundation, we formulate a `Behavioral Uncertainty
Principle,' demonstrating that static and dynamic distortions cannot be
minimized simultaneously. We identify that real-world systems seem to resist
complete deterministic decomposition due to entangled static and dynamic
effects. We also present two general-purpose theorems linking function variance
to mean-squared Lipschitz continuity and learning complexity. This yields a
model-agnostic, task-aware complexity metric, showing that lower-variance
components are inherently easier to learn.
  These insights explain the empirical benefits of structured residual
learning, including improved generalization, reduced parameter count, and lower
training cost, as previously observed in power amplifier linearization
experiments. The framework is broadly applicable and offers a scalable,
theoretically grounded approach to modeling complex dynamic nonlinear systems.

TL;DR: 本文提出了图卷积网络(GCN)在动态图环境中归纳节点分类的PAC-Bayesian理论分析，建立了考虑数据依赖性和非平稳性的泛化边界，并给出了保证泛化间隙收敛到零的充分条件。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的图具有动态特性，新节点不断加入，现有连接随时间变化。以往基于转导学习框架的理论研究未能充分建模这种时间演化和结构动态性。

Method: 采用PAC-Bayesian理论分析方法，将节点视为依赖且非同分布的数据点，推导一层和二层GCN的泛化边界，明确纳入数据依赖性和非平稳性的影响。

Result: 建立了一层GCN的新泛化边界，给出了泛化间隙随节点数增加收敛到零的充分条件。对于二层GCN，发现需要更强的图拓扑假设来保证收敛。

Conclusion: 这项工作为理解和改进动态图环境中GNN的泛化能力奠定了理论基础，特别强调了处理数据依赖性和非平稳性的重要性。

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved remarkable success in processing
graph-structured data across various applications. A critical aspect of
real-world graphs is their dynamic nature, where new nodes are continually
added and existing connections may change over time. Previous theoretical
studies, largely based on the transductive learning framework, fail to
adequately model such temporal evolution and structural dynamics. In this
paper, we presents a PAC-Bayesian theoretical analysis of graph convolutional
networks (GCNs) for inductive node classification, treating nodes as dependent
and non-identically distributed data points. We derive novel generalization
bounds for one-layer GCNs that explicitly incorporate the effects of data
dependency and non-stationarity, and establish sufficient conditions under
which the generalization gap converges to zero as the number of nodes
increases. Furthermore, we extend our analysis to two-layer GCNs, and reveal
that it requires stronger assumptions on graph topology to guarantee
convergence. This work establishes a theoretical foundation for understanding
and improving GNN generalization in dynamic graph environments.

Conclusion: HAO和TBFact为肌肿诊疗会议提供了可靠、可扩展的自动化支持基础，有效解决了临床摘要生成的效率和评估挑战

Abstract: Molecular Tumor Boards (MTBs) are multidisciplinary forums where oncology
specialists collaboratively assess complex patient cases to determine optimal
treatment strategies. A central element of this process is the patient summary,
typically compiled by a medical oncologist, radiation oncologist, or surgeon,
or their trained medical assistant, who distills heterogeneous medical records
into a concise narrative to facilitate discussion. This manual approach is
often labor-intensive, subjective, and prone to omissions of critical
information. To address these limitations, we introduce the Healthcare Agent
Orchestrator (HAO), a Large Language Model (LLM)-driven AI agent that
coordinates a multi-agent clinical workflow to generate accurate and
comprehensive patient summaries for MTBs. Evaluating predicted patient
summaries against ground truth presents additional challenges due to stylistic
variation, ordering, synonym usage, and phrasing differences, which complicate
the measurement of both succinctness and completeness. To overcome these
evaluation hurdles, we propose TBFact, a ``model-as-a-judge'' framework
designed to assess the comprehensiveness and succinctness of generated
summaries. Using a benchmark dataset derived from de-identified tumor board
discussions, we applied TBFact to evaluate our Patient History agent. Results
show that the agent captured 94% of high-importance information (including
partial entailments) and achieved a TBFact recall of 0.84 under strict
entailment criteria. We further demonstrate that TBFact enables a data-free
evaluation framework that institutions can deploy locally without sharing
sensitive clinical data. Together, HAO and TBFact establish a robust foundation
for delivering reliable and scalable support to MTBs.

Conclusion: 这些结果为解释推理训练引起的行为变化建立了一个原则性框架，证明了轻量级干预可以达到全微调性能同时保持可解释性。

Abstract: The mechanisms by which reasoning training reshapes language-model
computations remain poorly understood. We study lightweight steering vectors
inserted into the base model's residual stream and trained with a
reinforcement-learning objective, which can match full fine-tuning performance
while retaining the interpretability of small, additive interventions. Using
logit-lens readouts, path patching, and circuit analyses, we analyze two models
and find: (i) the last-layer steering vector behaves like a token-substitution
bias concentrated on the first generated token, consistently boosting tokens
such as "To" and "Step"; and (ii) the penultimate-layer steering vector leaves
attention patterns largely unchanged and instead acts through the MLP and
unembedding, preferentially up-weighting process words and structure symbols.
These results establish a principled framework for interpreting the behavioral
changes induced by reasoning training.

Conclusion: 识别了当前开放挑战并提出了未来研究方向，为这一新兴领域的未来发展提供指导。

Abstract: Graph anomaly detection (GAD) has attracted increasing attention in recent
years for identifying malicious samples in a wide range of graph-based
applications, such as social media and e-commerce. However, most GAD methods
assume identical training and testing distributions and are tailored to
specific tasks, resulting in limited adaptability to real-world scenarios such
as shifting data distributions and scarce training samples in new applications.
To address the limitations, recent work has focused on improving the
generalization capability of GAD models through transfer learning that
leverages knowledge from related domains to enhance detection performance, or
developing "one-for-all" GAD foundation models that generalize across multiple
applications. Since a systematic understanding of generalization in GAD is
still lacking, in this paper, we provide a comprehensive review of
generalization in GAD. We first trace the evolution of generalization in GAD
and formalize the problem settings, which further leads to our systematic
taxonomy. Rooted in this fine-grained taxonomy, an up-to-date and comprehensive
review is conducted for the existing generalized GAD methods. Finally, we
identify current open challenges and suggest future directions to inspire
future research in this emerging field.

Motivation: 传统共情评估方法依赖主观报告，存在偏见且无法客观捕捉共情形成过程；现有EEG方法主要提取静态模式，忽略时间动态性

Method: BEAM框架包含三个核心组件：1)LaBraM编码器进行时空特征提取，2)特征融合模块整合多视角信号信息，3)对比学习模块增强类别分离

Result: 在CBCP数据集上，BEAM在多个指标上超越最先进方法，展示了客观共情评估的潜力

Conclusion: BEAM为儿童共情能力提供了客观评估工具，并为早期干预儿童亲社会发展提供了初步见解

Abstract: Empathy in young children is crucial for their social and emotional
development, yet predicting it remains challenging. Traditional methods often
only rely on self-reports or observer-based labeling, which are susceptible to
bias and fail to objectively capture the process of empathy formation. EEG
offers an objective alternative; however, current approaches primarily extract
static patterns, neglecting temporal dynamics. To overcome these limitations,
we propose a novel deep learning framework, the Brainwave Empathy Assessment
Model (BEAM), to predict empathy levels in children aged 4-6 years. BEAM
leverages multi-view EEG signals to capture both cognitive and emotional
dimensions of empathy. The framework comprises three key components: 1) a
LaBraM-based encoder for effective spatio-temporal feature extraction, 2) a
feature fusion module to integrate complementary information from multi-view
signals, and 3) a contrastive learning module to enhance class separation.
Validated on the CBCP dataset, BEAM outperforms state-of-the-art methods across
multiple metrics, demonstrating its potential for objective empathy assessment
and providing a preliminary insight into early interventions in children's
prosocial development.

TL;DR: 提出一种简单算法，仅需单个图的少量数据样本即可学习局部路由策略，该策略能在欧几里得度量空间的几何随机图类中泛化，通过训练DNN解决全对近似最短路径问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决几何随机图中的高效、可扩展路由问题，利用网络领域知识设计输入特征和策略函数，学习近似最优策略并确保泛化能力。

Method: 使用深度神经网络训练局部路由策略，节点仅基于自身和邻居状态进行数据包转发。设计了两种输入特征：仅目标距离，以及目标距离加节点拉伸度。

Result: 仅使用目标距离特征的DNN学习到了与经典贪婪转发策略完全匹配的策略；使用双特征的新策略GreedyTensile路由几乎总是优于贪婪转发。

Conclusion: 该方法能够学习到可解释、超低延迟的路由策略，通过符号化解释将DNN转化为两个线性操作的简单形式，证明了领域知识指导下的机器学习在路由问题中的有效性。

Abstract: We propose a simple algorithm that needs only a few data samples from a
single graph for learning local routing policies that generalize across a rich
class of geometric random graphs in Euclidean metric spaces. We thus solve the
all-pairs near-shortest path problem by training deep neural networks (DNNs)
that let each graph node efficiently and scalably route (i.e., forward) packets
by considering only the node's state and the state of the neighboring nodes.
Our algorithm design exploits network domain knowledge in the selection of
input features and design of the policy function for learning an approximately
optimal policy. Domain knowledge also provides theoretical assurance that the
choice of a ``seed graph'' and its node data sampling suffices for
generalizable learning. Remarkably, one of these DNNs we train -- using
distance-to-destination as the only input feature -- learns a policy that
exactly matches the well-known Greedy Forwarding policy, which forwards packets
to the neighbor with the shortest distance to the destination. We also learn a
new policy, which we call GreedyTensile routing -- using both
distance-to-destination and node stretch as the input features -- that almost
always outperforms greedy forwarding. We demonstrate the explainability and
ultra-low latency run-time operation of Greedy Tensile routing by symbolically
interpreting its DNN in low-complexity terms of two linear actions.

Conclusion: gcGAIL对空间变化、数据稀疏性和行为多样性具有鲁棒性，能够预测任意时间的个体行为响应，为个性化激励提供基础

Abstract: Understanding and modeling individual travel behavior responses is crucial
for urban mobility regulation and policy evaluation. The Markov decision
process (MDP) provides a structured framework for dynamic travel behavior
modeling at the individual level. However, solving an MDP in this context is
highly data-intensive and faces challenges of data quantity, spatial-temporal
coverage, and situational diversity. To address these, we propose a
group-effect-enhanced generative adversarial imitation learning (gcGAIL) model
that improves the individual behavior modeling efficiency by leveraging shared
behavioral patterns among passenger groups. We validate the gcGAIL model using
a public transport fare-discount case study and compare against
state-of-the-art benchmarks, including adversarial inverse reinforcement
learning (AIRL), baseline GAIL, and conditional GAIL. Experimental results
demonstrate that gcGAIL outperforms these methods in learning individual travel
behavior responses to incentives over time in terms of accuracy,
generalization, and pattern demonstration efficiency. Notably, gcGAIL is robust
to spatial variation, data sparsity, and behavioral diversity, maintaining
strong performance even with partial expert demonstrations and underrepresented
passenger groups. The gcGAIL model predicts the individual behavior response at
any time, providing the basis for personalized incentives to induce sustainable
behavior changes (better timing of incentive injections).

*Xiaolu Fu,Ziyuan Bao,Eiman Kanjo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TrajAware是一个基于强化学习的VANET路由框架，通过动作空间剪枝、图交叉注意力和轨迹感知预测来解决动态拓扑和资源受限问题，在边缘设备上实现高效路由。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 车载自组织网络(VANET)在智能交通系统中至关重要，但由于动态拓扑、不完全观测和边缘设备资源有限，路由仍然具有挑战性。现有RL方法通常假设固定图结构，在网络条件变化时需要重新训练，不适合在受限硬件上部署。

Method: TrajAware包含三个组件：(1)动作空间剪枝，减少冗余邻居选项同时保持两跳可达性；(2)图交叉注意力，将剪枝后的邻居映射到全局图上下文；(3)轨迹感知预测，使用历史路由和路口信息估计部分观测下的实时位置。

Result: 在SUMO模拟器中使用真实城市地图进行评估，采用leave-one-city-out设置。结果显示TrajAware实现了接近最短路径和高交付率，同时在完整和部分观测场景中都优于最先进的基线方法。

Conclusion: TrajAware框架在保持边缘设备适用效率的同时，能够有效处理VANET中的动态路由问题，为边缘AI部署提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Vehicular ad hoc networks (VANETs) are a crucial component of intelligent
transportation systems; however, routing remains challenging due to dynamic
topologies, incomplete observations, and the limited resources of edge devices.
Existing reinforcement learning (RL) approaches often assume fixed graph
structures and require retraining when network conditions change, making them
unsuitable for deployment on constrained hardware. We present TrajAware, an
RL-based framework designed for edge AI deployment in VANETs. TrajAware
integrates three components: (i) action space pruning, which reduces redundant
neighbour options while preserving two-hop reachability, alleviating the curse
of dimensionality; (ii) graph cross-attention, which maps pruned neighbours to
the global graph context, producing features that generalise across diverse
network sizes; and (iii) trajectory-aware prediction, which uses historical
routes and junction information to estimate real-time positions under partial
observations. We evaluate TrajAware in the open-source SUMO simulator using
real-world city maps with a leave-one-city-out setup. Results show that
TrajAware achieves near-shortest paths and high delivery ratios while
maintaining efficiency suitable for constrained edge devices, outperforming
state-of-the-art baselines in both full and partial observation scenarios.

*Victor Toscano-Duran,Rocio Gonzalez-Diaz,Miguel A. Gutiérrez-Naranjo*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种新型的小型浅层神经网络Barycentric Neural Network (BNN)，利用重心坐标和固定基点集来精确表示连续分段线性函数，并引入长度加权持久熵(LWPE)作为稳定的拓扑特征，通过优化基点而非内部权重来实现快速高效的函数逼近。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统深度或过参数化神经网络计算成本高，需要一种在资源受限环境下（有限基点和训练轮次）仍能提供灵活且可解释的函数逼近方法。

Method: 提出BNN网络结构，利用重心坐标和固定基点定义网络；引入LWPE作为损失函数；直接优化基点而非网络内部权重。

Result: 实验结果显示该方法相比MSE、RMSE、MAE和log-cosh等传统损失函数，具有更优越和更快的逼近性能。

Conclusion: BNN结合LWPE损失函数为资源受限环境下的非线性连续函数逼近提供了灵活、几何可解释且高效的新方法。

Abstract: While it is well-established that artificial neural networks are
\emph{universal approximators} for continuous functions on compact domains,
many modern approaches rely on deep or overparameterized architectures that
incur high computational costs. In this paper, a new type of \emph{small
shallow} neural network, called the \emph{Barycentric Neural Network} ($\BNN$),
is proposed, which leverages a fixed set of \emph{base points} and their
\emph{barycentric coordinates} to define both its structure and its parameters.
We demonstrate that our $\BNN$ enables the exact representation of
\emph{continuous piecewise linear functions} ($\CPLF$s), ensuring strict
continuity across segments. Since any continuous function over a compact domain
can be approximated arbitrarily well by $\CPLF$s, the $\BNN$ naturally emerges
as a flexible and interpretable tool for \emph{function approximation}. Beyond
the use of this representation, the main contribution of the paper is the
introduction of a new variant of \emph{persistent entropy}, a topological
feature that is stable and scale invariant, called the \emph{length-weighted
persistent entropy} ($\LWPE$), which is weighted by the lifetime of topological
features. Our framework, which combines the $\BNN$ with a loss function based
on our $\LWPE$, aims to provide flexible and geometrically interpretable
approximations of nonlinear continuous functions in resource-constrained
settings, such as those with limited base points for $\BNN$ design and few
training epochs. Instead of optimizing internal weights, our approach directly
\emph{optimizes the base points that define the $\BNN$}. Experimental results
show that our approach achieves \emph{superior and faster approximation
performance} compared to classical loss functions such as MSE, RMSE, MAE, and
log-cosh.

TL;DR: 提出基于概率模型的智能代理理论，通过对数加权汇总定义代理组合，证明在三个及以上结果空间中可实现严格一致性，并形式化LLM中的对抗性人格现象（Waluigi效应）。


<details>

Motivation: 为智能代理建立一个原理性的数学框架，理解子代理如何聚合成协调的高层实体，并探索对人工智能系统对齐问题的新含义。

Method: 以概率模型为基础，将代理表示为结果分布，以对数分数作为认知效用，通过对数加权汇总定义组合操作，并使用克隆不变性、连续性和开放性来建立递归结构。

Result: 证明在线性汇总或二元结果空间中不可能实现严格一致性，但在三个及以上结果空间中可能。形式化了LLM中的Waluigi效应：引导善良人格（Luigi）会产生对抗性对应人格，而显现-压制策略比纯粹Luigi强化能更大程度减少一阶对齐问题。

Conclusion: 通过为子代理聚合成协调高层实体提供原理性数学框架，为代理智能系统的对齐问题带来了新的见解和应用前景。

Abstract: We develop a theory of intelligent agency grounded in probabilistic modeling
for neural models. Agents are represented as outcome distributions with
epistemic utility given by log score, and compositions are defined through
weighted logarithmic pooling that strictly improves every member's welfare. We
prove that strict unanimity is impossible under linear pooling or in binary
outcome spaces, but possible with three or more outcomes. Our framework admits
recursive structure via cloning invariance, continuity, and openness, while
tilt-based analysis rules out trivial duplication. Finally, we formalize an
agentic alignment phenomenon in LLMs using our theory: eliciting a benevolent
persona ("Luigi'") induces an antagonistic counterpart ("Waluigi"), while a
manifest-then-suppress Waluigi strategy yields strictly larger first-order
misalignment reduction than pure Luigi reinforcement alone. These results
clarify how developing a principled mathematical framework for how subagents
can coalesce into coherent higher-level entities provides novel implications
for alignment in agentic AI systems.

focus on generative AI for financial time series in decision-making
applications and employ the nested optimal transport distance, a time-causal
variant of optimal transport distance, which is robust to tasks such as
hedging, optimal stopping, and reinforcement learning. Moreover, we propose a
statistically consistent, naturally parallelizable algorithm for its
computation, achieving substantial speedups over existing approaches.

Conclusion: RT-HCP算法为模型基于RL在高频控制应用中提供了有效解决方案，在保持样本效率的同时满足实时控制要求

Abstract: Learning a controller directly on the robot requires extreme sample
efficiency. Model-based reinforcement learning (RL) methods are the most sample
efficient, but they often suffer from a too long inference time to meet the
robot control frequency requirements. In this paper, we address the sample
efficiency and inference time challenges with two contributions. First, we
define a general framework to deal with inference delays where the slow
inference robot controller provides a sequence of actions to feed the
control-hungry robotic platform without execution gaps. Then, we compare
several RL algorithms in the light of this framework and propose RT-HCP, an
algorithm that offers an excellent trade-off between performance, sample
efficiency and inference time. We validate the superiority of RT-HCP with
experiments where we learn a controller directly on a simple but high frequency
FURUTA pendulum platform. Code: github.com/elasriz/RTHCP

Motivation: 解决图机器学习中长程交互建模的挑战，现有基于小波的图神经网络依赖有限阶多项式近似，限制了感受野并阻碍长程传播。

Method: 将小波滤波器分解为互补的局部和全局组件：局部聚合使用高效低阶多项式处理，长程交互通过灵活的谱域参数化捕获。

Result: 在长程基准测试中达到基于小波方法的最先进性能，同时在短程数据集上保持竞争力。

Conclusion: LR-GWN在统一的小波框架内整合了短距离和长距离信息流，有效解决了图长程交互建模问题。

Abstract: Modeling long-range interactions, the propagation of information across
distant parts of a graph, is a central challenge in graph machine learning.
Graph wavelets, inspired by multi-resolution signal processing, provide a
principled way to capture both local and global structures. However, existing
wavelet-based graph neural networks rely on finite-order polynomial
approximations, which limit their receptive fields and hinder long-range
propagation. We propose Long-Range Graph Wavelet Networks (LR-GWN), which
decompose wavelet filters into complementary local and global components. Local
aggregation is handled with efficient low-order polynomials, while long-range
interactions are captured through a flexible spectral domain parameterization.
This hybrid design unifies short- and long-distance information flow within a
principled wavelet framework. Experiments show that LR-GWN achieves
state-of-the-art performance among wavelet-based methods on long-range
benchmarks, while remaining competitive on short-range datasets.

Conclusion: DRL和DPO技术为构建强大且与人类对齐的大型视觉语言模型提供了重要途径，但仍需解决多个技术挑战以实现更稳健的多模态交互。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) or multimodal large language models
represent a significant advancement in artificial intelligence, enabling
systems to understand and generate content across both visual and textual
modalities. While large-scale pretraining has driven substantial progress,
fine-tuning these models for aligning with human values or engaging in specific
tasks or behaviors remains a critical challenge. Deep Reinforcement Learning
(DRL) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) offer promising frameworks for
this aligning process. While DRL enables models to optimize actions using
reward signals instead of relying solely on supervised preference data, DPO
directly aligns the policy with preferences, eliminating the need for an
explicit reward model. This overview explores paradigms for fine-tuning LVLMs,
highlighting how DRL and DPO techniques can be used to align models with human
preferences and values, improve task performance, and enable adaptive
multimodal interaction. We categorize key approaches, examine sources of
preference data, reward signals, and discuss open challenges such as
scalability, sample efficiency, continual learning, generalization, and safety.
The goal is to provide a clear understanding of how DRL and DPO contribute to
the evolution of robust and human-aligned LVLMs.

TL;DR: 提出异步消息传递框架解决GNN中的过度压缩问题，通过基于节点中心性的分批更新来提升长距离交互性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统GNN在需要长距离交互的任务中存在过度压缩问题，图重连方法会破坏归纳偏置，增加通道容量又会提高模型复杂度

Method: 提出模型无关的异步更新框架，基于节点中心性值在每层创建节点批次，只更新批次内节点特征，避免同步压缩到固定容量通道

Result: 在6个标准图数据集和2个长距离数据集上测试，在REDDIT-BINARY和Peptides-struct上分别获得5%和4%的性能提升

Conclusion: 异步消息传递框架能有效缓解GNN的过度压缩问题，保持更高的特征敏感度边界，在长距离任务中表现优异

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) suffer from Oversquashing, which occurs when
tasks require long-range interactions. The problem arises from the presence of
bottlenecks that limit the propagation of messages among distant nodes.
Recently, graph rewiring methods modify edge connectivity and are expected to
perform well on long-range tasks. Yet, graph rewiring compromises the inductive
bias, incurring significant information loss in solving the downstream task.
Furthermore, increasing channel capacity may overcome information bottlenecks
but enhance the parameter complexity of the model. To alleviate these
shortcomings, we propose an efficient model-agnostic framework that
asynchronously updates node features, unlike traditional synchronous message
passing GNNs. Our framework creates node batches in every layer based on the
node centrality values. The features of the nodes belonging to these batches
will only get updated. Asynchronous message updates process information
sequentially across layers, avoiding simultaneous compression into
fixed-capacity channels. We also theoretically establish that our proposed
framework maintains higher feature sensitivity bounds compared to standard
synchronous approaches. Our framework is applied to six standard graph datasets
and two long-range datasets to perform graph classification and achieves
impressive performances with a $5\%$ and $4\%$ improvements on REDDIT-BINARY
and Peptides-struct, respectively.

Result: 与分层隐式Q学习结合形成的Pi-HIQL方法，在性能和泛化能力上均有显著提升，特别是在stitching机制和大规模导航任务中表现突出

Conclusion: 物理信息正则化为离线目标条件强化学习提供了有效的几何归纳偏置，能够改善值函数与代价结构的一致性，具有广泛的兼容性和应用前景

Abstract: Offline Goal-Conditioned Reinforcement Learning (GCRL) holds great promise
for domains such as autonomous navigation and locomotion, where collecting
interactive data is costly and unsafe. However, it remains challenging in
practice due to the need to learn from datasets with limited coverage of the
state-action space and to generalize across long-horizon tasks. To improve on
these challenges, we propose a Physics-informed (Pi) regularized loss for value
learning, derived from the Eikonal Partial Differential Equation (PDE) and
which induces a geometric inductive bias in the learned value function. Unlike
generic gradient penalties that are primarily used to stabilize training, our
formulation is grounded in continuous-time optimal control and encourages value
functions to align with cost-to-go structures. The proposed regularizer is
broadly compatible with temporal-difference-based value learning and can be
integrated into existing Offline GCRL algorithms. When combined with
Hierarchical Implicit Q-Learning (HIQL), the resulting method, Physics-informed
HIQL (Pi-HIQL), yields significant improvements in both performance and
generalization, with pronounced gains in stitching regimes and large-scale
navigation tasks.

Method: 提出基于生物免疫机制的safe-by-coevolution概念，建立R²AI框架，整合快速/慢速安全模型、对抗模拟验证和持续反馈循环，通过安全风洞进行测试。

Result: 该框架提供了一种可扩展、主动的方法，在动态环境中维持持续安全，同时处理短期弱点和长期存在风险。

Conclusion: R²AI框架为AI安全提供了一条有前景的路径，通过协同进化机制确保AI在向AGI和ASI发展过程中的安全性。

Abstract: In this position paper, we address the persistent gap between rapidly growing
AI capabilities and lagging safety progress. Existing paradigms divide into
``Make AI Safe'', which applies post-hoc alignment and guardrails but remains
brittle and reactive, and ``Make Safe AI'', which emphasizes intrinsic safety
but struggles to address unforeseen risks in open-ended environments. We
therefore propose \textit{safe-by-coevolution} as a new formulation of the
``Make Safe AI'' paradigm, inspired by biological immunity, in which safety
becomes a dynamic, adversarial, and ongoing learning process. To operationalize
this vision, we introduce \texttt{R$^2$AI} -- \textit{Resistant and Resilient
AI} -- as a practical framework that unites resistance against known threats
with resilience to unforeseen risks. \texttt{R$^2$AI} integrates \textit{fast
and slow safe models}, adversarial simulation and verification through a
\textit{safety wind tunnel}, and continual feedback loops that guide safety and
capability to coevolve. We argue that this framework offers a scalable and
proactive path to maintain continual safety in dynamic environments, addressing
both near-term vulnerabilities and long-term existential risks as AI advances
toward AGI and ASI.

Method: 引入floq方法，使用速度场参数化Q函数，通过流匹配技术进行训练，利用数值积分多步计算目标速度场，并使用TD学习目标训练底层速度场。

Result: 在具有挑战性的离线RL基准测试和在线微调任务中，floq将性能提升了近1.8倍，并且在容量扩展方面显著优于标准TD学习架构。

Conclusion: 迭代计算在价值学习方面具有巨大潜力，floq方法通过精细控制集成步数实现了比传统架构更好的容量扩展和性能提升。

Abstract: A hallmark of modern large-scale machine learning techniques is the use of
training objectives that provide dense supervision to intermediate
computations, such as teacher forcing the next token in language models or
denoising step-by-step in diffusion models. This enables models to learn
complex functions in a generalizable manner. Motivated by this observation, we
investigate the benefits of iterative computation for temporal difference (TD)
methods in reinforcement learning (RL). Typically they represent value
functions in a monolithic fashion, without iterative compute. We introduce floq
(flow-matching Q-functions), an approach that parameterizes the Q-function
using a velocity field and trains it using techniques from flow-matching,
typically used in generative modeling. This velocity field underneath the flow
is trained using a TD-learning objective, which bootstraps from values produced
by a target velocity field, computed by running multiple steps of numerical
integration. Crucially, floq allows for more fine-grained control and scaling
of the Q-function capacity than monolithic architectures, by appropriately
setting the number of integration steps. Across a suite of challenging offline
RL benchmarks and online fine-tuning tasks, floq improves performance by nearly
1.8x. floq scales capacity far better than standard TD-learning architectures,
highlighting the potential of iterative computation for value learning.

Conclusion: AxelSMOTE通过智能体交互框架有效解决了传统过采样技术的局限性，为类别不平衡问题提供了创新的解决方案

Abstract: Class imbalance in machine learning poses a significant challenge, as skewed
datasets often hinder performance on minority classes. Traditional oversampling
techniques, which are commonly used to alleviate class imbalance, have several
drawbacks: they treat features independently, lack similarity-based controls,
limit sample diversity, and fail to manage synthetic variety effectively. To
overcome these issues, we introduce AxelSMOTE, an innovative agent-based
approach that views data instances as autonomous agents engaging in complex
interactions. Based on Axelrod's cultural dissemination model, AxelSMOTE
implements four key innovations: (1) trait-based feature grouping to preserve
correlations; (2) a similarity-based probabilistic exchange mechanism for
meaningful interactions; (3) Beta distribution blending for realistic
interpolation; and (4) controlled diversity injection to avoid overfitting.
Experiments on eight imbalanced datasets demonstrate that AxelSMOTE outperforms
state-of-the-art sampling methods while maintaining computational efficiency.

Abstract: Targeted data poisoning attacks pose an increasingly serious threat due to
their ease of deployment and high success rates. These attacks aim to
manipulate the prediction for a single test sample in classification models.
Unlike indiscriminate attacks that aim to decrease overall test performance,
targeted attacks present a unique threat to individual test instances. This
threat model raises a fundamental question: what factors make certain test
samples more susceptible to successful poisoning than others? We investigate
how attack difficulty varies across different test instances and identify key
characteristics that influence vulnerability. This paper introduces three
predictive criteria for targeted data poisoning difficulty: ergodic prediction
accuracy (analyzed through clean training dynamics), poison distance, and
poison budget. Our experimental results demonstrate that these metrics
effectively predict the varying difficulty of real-world targeted poisoning
attacks across diverse scenarios, offering practitioners valuable insights for

*Tarhib Al Azad,Shahana Ibrahim*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 这篇论文研究了在训练标签有噪声情况下的健壁分布外检测(OOD)问题，提出了一种结合损失缩正和低秩稀疏分解的方法来提高OOD检测的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代AI系统在安全关键应用中需要健壁的OOD检测能力，但标签噪声会显著降低OOD性能，而现有方法无法有效解决这一挑战。

Method: 提出了一种健壁OOD检测框架，结合了噪声标签学习中的损失缩正技术和信号处理中的低秩稀疏分解方法。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的广泛实验表明，该方法显著超过了现有最先进的OOD检测技术，特别是在严重标签噪声环境下。

Conclusion: 该研究为解决标签噪声下OOD检测性能降级问题提供了有效的方案，对安全关键AI系统的实际应用具有重要意义。

Abstract: Robust out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is an indispensable component of
modern artificial intelligence (AI) systems, especially in safety-critical
applications where models must identify inputs from unfamiliar classes not seen
during training. While OOD detection has been extensively studied in the
machine learning literature--with both post hoc and training-based
approaches--its effectiveness under noisy training labels remains
underexplored. Recent studies suggest that label noise can significantly
degrade OOD performance, yet principled solutions to this issue are lacking. In
this work, we demonstrate that directly combining existing label noise-robust
methods with OOD detection strategies is insufficient to address this critical
challenge. To overcome this, we propose a robust OOD detection framework that
integrates loss correction techniques from the noisy label learning literature
with low-rank and sparse decomposition methods from signal processing.
Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate
that our method significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art OOD detection
techniques, particularly under severe noisy label settings.

TL;DR: SEELE是一个新颖的监督辅助强化学习框架，通过动态调整问题难度来提升大型语言模型的推理能力探索效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的RLVR方法存在探索效率低下的问题，当问题过于困难时模型无法找到可行的推理路径，而问题过于简单时学习效果有限。

Method: SEELE通过为每个训练样本添加可调节长度的提示（部分解决方案），使用多轮采样策略和项目反应理论模型来动态确定最优提示长度，使问题难度与模型能力相匹配。

Result: 在六个数学推理基准测试中，SEELE比GRPO和SFT分别高出11.8和10.5个百分点，比之前最好的监督辅助方法平均高出3.6个百分点。

Conclusion: SEELE通过实例级实时难度调整有效解决了RLVR中的探索效率问题，显著提升了语言模型的推理性能。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has achieved remarkable
success in enhancing the reasoning capabilities of large language models
(LLMs). However, existing RLVR methods often suffer from exploration
inefficiency due to mismatches between the training data's difficulty and the
model's capability. LLMs fail to discover viable reasoning paths when problems
are overly difficult, while learning little new capability when problems are
too simple. In this work, we formalize the impact of problem difficulty by
quantifying the relationship between loss descent speed and rollout accuracy.
Building on this analysis, we propose SEELE, a novel supervision-aided RLVR
framework that dynamically adjusts problem difficulty to stay within the
high-efficiency region. SEELE augments each training sample by appending a hint
(part of a full solution) after the original problem. Unlike previous
hint-based approaches, SEELE deliberately and adaptively adjusts the hint
length for each problem to achieve an optimal difficulty. To determine the
optimal hint length, SEELE employs a multi-round rollout sampling strategy. In
each round, it fits an item response theory model to the accuracy-hint pairs
collected in preceding rounds to predict the required hint length for the next
round. This instance-level, real-time difficulty adjustment aligns problem
difficulty with the evolving model capability, thereby improving exploration
efficiency. Experimental results show that SEELE outperforms Group Relative
Policy Optimization (GRPO) and Supervised Fine-tuning (SFT) by +11.8 and +10.5
points, respectively, and surpasses the best previous supervision-aided
approach by +3.6 points on average across six math reasoning benchmarks.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于自动微分技术的梯度下降方法，用于优化中子反射测量数据分析，替代传统的优化程序和机器学习代理模型，保持了物理直觉并提高了效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 中子反射测量(NR)是一种间接测量技术，需要解决逆建模问题来获取物理参数。传统方法在处理大量数据或复杂多层结构时效率低下，而现有的机器学习代理模型虽然快速但失去了物理直觉。

Method: 使用自动微分技术对前向反射模型本身进行梯度下降优化，精确计算误差函数相对于感兴趣参数的梯度，从而利用现代优化和推理技术。

Result: 在两个基准案例研究中展示了最先进的性能：在厚氧化石英薄膜上表现优异，在有机LED多层器件的高复杂度场景中实现了稳健的协同拟合性能。

Conclusion: 该方法为中子反射测量提供了一种新颖高效的梯度优化途径，保持了物理模型的完整性，并提供了开源的可微分反射测量核库，便于其他NR数据集应用基于梯度的方法。

Abstract: Neutron reflectometry (NR) is a powerful technique to probe surfaces and
interfaces. NR is inherently an indirect measurement technique, access to the
physical quantities of interest (layer thickness, scattering length density,
roughness), necessitate the solution of an inverse modelling problem, that is
inefficient for large amounts of data or complex multiplayer structures (e.g.
lithium batteries / electrodes). Recently, surrogate machine learning models
have been proposed as an alternative to existing optimisation routines.
Although such approaches have been successful, physical intuition is lost when
replacing governing equations with fast neural networks. Instead, we propose a
novel and efficient approach; to optimise reflectivity data analysis by
performing gradient descent on the forward reflection model itself. Herein,
automatic differentiation techniques are used to evaluate exact gradients of
the error function with respect to the parameters of interest. Access to these
quantities enables users of neutron reflectometry to harness a host of powerful
modern optimisation and inference techniques that remain thus far unexploited
in the context of neutron reflectometry. This paper presents two benchmark case
studies; demonstrating state-of-the-art performance on a thick oxide quartz
film, and robust co-fitting performance in the high complexity regime of
organic LED multilayer devices. Additionally, we provide an open-source library
of differentiable reflectometry kernels in the python programming language so
that gradient based approaches can readily be applied to other NR datasets.

Motivation: 探索神经网络如何学习群运算的机制，解释grokking现象的形成原因

Method: 将问题重构为学习3阶张量，利用群表示论进行低秩分解，通过汇聚结构消除多余组件

Result: 网络能够找到低秩实现方案，在限定宽度下近似词张量，实现了类似Strassen的高效矩阵乘法

Conclusion: 这个工作解释了神经网络学习群运算的机制，揭示grokking现象的原因，为理解深度学习提供了重要见解

Abstract: In this work, we demonstrate that a simple two-layer neural network with
standard activation functions can learn an arbitrary word operation in any
finite group, provided sufficient width is available and exhibits grokking
while doing so. To explain the mechanism by which this is achieved, we reframe
the problem as that of learning a particular $3$-tensor, which we show is
typically of low rank. A key insight is that low-rank implementations of this
tensor can be obtained by decomposing it along triplets of basic self-conjugate
representations of the group and leveraging the fusion structure to rule out
many components. Focusing on a phenomenologically similar but more tractable
surrogate model, we show that the network is able to find such low-rank
implementations (or approximations thereof), thereby using limited width to
approximate the word-tensor in a generalizable way. In the case of the simple
multiplication word, we further elucidate the form of these low-rank
implementations, showing that the network effectively implements efficient
matrix multiplication in the sense of Strassen. Our work also sheds light on
the mechanism by which a network reaches such a solution under gradient
descent.

Motivation: 随着生成式AI系统在科学、商业和政府领域的广泛应用，理解其失败模式（如幻觉）对于在高风险领域建立信任和采用至关重要。

Method: 使用稀疏自编码器捕获预训练transformer模型中的概念表示，在输入空间不确定性受控的实验场景下系统分析幻觉产生机制。

Result: 发现随着输入信息变得非结构化，模型使用的语义概念数量增加；在纯噪声输入下识别出大量有意义的概念；证明可以从激活层中的概念模式可靠预测幻觉输出。

Conclusion: 这些发现对AI模型与人类价值观对齐、AI安全、对抗攻击防御以及自动量化模型幻觉风险具有重要意义。

Abstract: As generative AI systems become competent and democratized in science,
business, and government, deeper insight into their failure modes now poses an
acute need. The occasional volatility in their behavior, such as the propensity
of transformer models to hallucinate, impedes trust and adoption of emerging AI
solutions in high-stakes areas. In the present work, we establish how and when
hallucinations arise in pre-trained transformer models through concept
representations captured by sparse autoencoders, under scenarios with
experimentally controlled uncertainty in the input space. Our systematic
experiments reveal that the number of semantic concepts used by the transformer
model grows as the input information becomes increasingly unstructured. In the
face of growing uncertainty in the input space, the transformer model becomes
prone to activate coherent yet input-insensitive semantic features, leading to
hallucinated output. At its extreme, for pure-noise inputs, we identify a wide
variety of robustly triggered and meaningful concepts in the intermediate
activations of pre-trained transformer models, whose functional integrity we
confirm through targeted steering. We also show that hallucinations in the
output of a transformer model can be reliably predicted from the concept
patterns embedded in transformer layer activations. This collection of insights
on transformer internal processing mechanics has immediate consequences for
aligning AI models with human values, AI safety, opening the attack surface for
potential adversarial attacks, and providing a basis for automatic
quantification of a model's hallucination risk.

Motivation: 传统的基于结果的强化学习虽然能显著提高大语言模型的推理准确性，但会导致生成多样性系统性下降，这在需要多样性的实际应用场景中会削弱性能。

Method: 提出了基于结果的探索方法：1）历史探索 - 使用UCB式奖励鼓励罕见答案；2）批次探索 - 惩罚批次内重复以促进测试时多样性。

Result: 在标准数学竞赛数据集上使用Llama和Qwen模型的实验表明，两种方法都能在提高准确性的同时缓解多样性崩溃问题。

Conclusion: 基于结果的探索方法为强化学习提供了一条实用路径，既能增强推理能力，又不牺牲对可扩展部署至关重要的多样性。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a powerful method for improving
the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). Outcome-based RL,
which rewards policies solely for the correctness of the final answer, yields
substantial accuracy gains but also induces a systematic loss in generation
diversity. This collapse undermines real-world performance, where diversity is
critical for test-time scaling. We analyze this phenomenon by viewing RL
post-training as a sampling process and show that, strikingly, RL can reduce
effective diversity even on the training set relative to the base model. Our
study highlights two central findings: (i) a transfer of diversity degradation,
where reduced diversity on solved problems propagates to unsolved ones, and
(ii) the tractability of the outcome space, since reasoning tasks admit only a
limited set of distinct answers. Motivated by these insights, we propose
outcome-based exploration, which assigns exploration bonuses according to final
outcomes. We introduce two complementary algorithms: historical exploration,
which encourages rarely observed answers via UCB-style bonuses, and batch
exploration, which penalizes within-batch repetition to promote test-time
diversity. Experiments on standard competition math with Llama and Qwen models
demonstrate that both methods improve accuracy while mitigating diversity
collapse. On the theoretical side, we formalize the benefit of outcome-based
exploration through a new model of outcome-based bandits. Together, these
contributions chart a practical path toward RL methods that enhance reasoning
without sacrificing the diversity essential for scalable deployment.

TL;DR: KARL框架通过结合主动学习和LLM，低成本扩展高质量功能标签数据集，在OOD场景下显著提升互补推荐准确性达37%，但在ID场景下改进有限且可能因过度学习而降低性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决互补推荐中行为标签噪声大与功能标签标注成本高的两难问题，需要一种能够高效扩展高质量标签数据的方法。

Method: 提出KARL框架，融合主动学习和大型语言模型，选择性采样分类器最困难的数据点，利用LLM进行标签扩展。

Result: 在OOD设置下准确率提升高达37%，在ID设置下改进小于0.5%，且持续学习可能降低准确性。

Conclusion: KARL通过知识扩展增加数据多样性，需要根据预测上下文（ID或OOD）动态调整采样策略的多样性。

Abstract: Complementary recommendations play a crucial role in e-commerce by enhancing
user experience through suggestions of compatible items. Accurate
classification of complementary item relationships requires reliable labels,
but their creation presents a dilemma. Behavior-based labels are widely used
because they can be easily generated from interaction logs; however, they often
contain significant noise and lack reliability. While function-based labels
(FBLs) provide high-quality definitions of complementary relationships by
carefully articulating them based on item functions, their reliance on costly
manual annotation severely limits a model's ability to generalize to diverse
items. To resolve this trade-off, we propose Knowledge-Augmented Relation
Learning (KARL), a framework that strategically fuses active learning with
large language models (LLMs). KARL efficiently expands a high-quality FBL
dataset at a low cost by selectively sampling data points that the classifier
finds the most difficult and uses the label extension of the LLM. Our
experiments showed that in out-of-distribution (OOD) settings, an unexplored
item feature space, KARL improved the baseline accuracy by up to 37%. In
contrast, in in-distribution (ID) settings, the learned item feature space, the
improvement was less than 0.5%, with prolonged learning could degrade accuracy.
These contrasting results are due to the data diversity driven by KARL's
knowledge expansion, suggesting the need for a dynamic sampling strategy that
adjusts diversity based on the prediction context (ID or OOD).

TL;DR: LESER是一个基于搜索引擎反馈强化学习的查询扩展框架，通过实时搜索反馈优化LLM，显著提升电商搜索的语义覆盖和检索相关性


<details>

Motivation: 电商搜索查询通常简短模糊，现有方法难以准确捕捉用户意图且难以规模化部署，需要更有效的查询扩展解决方案

Result: 在大规模真实电商数据集上验证，离线在线设置均显示显著改进，提升了语义覆盖、检索相关性和用户参与度

Conclusion: LESER为现代搜索系统提供了实用且可扩展的解决方案，能够生成符合平台规则的高质量查询扩展

Abstract: User queries in e-commerce search are often vague, short, and underspecified,
making it difficult for retrieval systems to match them accurately against
structured product catalogs. This challenge is amplified by the one-to-many
nature of user intent, where a single query can imply diverse and competing
needs. Existing methods, including neural query expansion and prompting-based
LLM approaches, fall short in real-world settings: they struggle to capture
nuanced user intent, often generate outputs that violate platform constraints,
and rely on workflows that are difficult to scale in production. We propose
Learning to Expand via Search Engine-feedback Reinforcement (LESER), a novel
framework that fine-tunes a context-aware LLM using real-time search engine
feedback as supervision. LESER formulates query expansion as a retrieval
optimization task and leverages Group Relative Policy Optimization to learn
directly from relevance and coverage metrics. LESER is trained to reason over
search results and produce high quality query expansions that align with
platform rules and retrieval objectives. We evaluate LESER on large-scale,
real-world e-commerce datasets, demonstrating substantial improvements in both
offline and online settings. Our results show that LESER not only enhances
semantic coverage and retrieval relevance but also delivers measurable gains in
user engagement, making it a practical and scalable solution for modern search
systems.

Abstract: Vector data is prevalent across business and scientific applications, and its
popularity is growing with the proliferation of learned embeddings. Vector data
collections often reach billions of vectors with thousands of dimensions, thus,
increasing the complexity of their analysis. Vector search is the backbone of
many critical analytical tasks, and graph-based methods have become the best
choice for analytical tasks that do not require guarantees on the quality of
the answers. Although several paradigms (seed selection, incremental insertion,
neighborhood propagation, neighborhood diversification, and divide-and-conquer)
have been employed to design in-memory graph-based vector search algorithms, a
systematic comparison of the key algorithmic advances is still missing. We
conduct an exhaustive experimental evaluation of twelve state-of-the-art
methods on seven real data collections, with sizes up to 1 billion vectors. We
share key insights about the strengths and limitations of these methods; e.g.,
the best approaches are typically based on incremental insertion and
neighborhood diversification, and the choice of the base graph can hurt
scalability. Finally, we discuss open research directions, such as the
importance of devising more sophisticated data adaptive seed selection and
diversification strategies.

Abstract: Recommender systems have generated tremendous value for both users and
businesses, drawing significant attention from academia and industry alike.
However, due to practical constraints, academic research remains largely
confined to offline dataset optimizations, lacking access to real user data and
large-scale recommendation platforms. This limitation reduces practical
relevance, slows technological progress, and hampers a full understanding of
the key challenges in recommender systems. In this survey, we provide a
systematic review of industrial recommender systems and contrast them with
their academic counterparts. We highlight key differences in data scale,
real-time requirements, and evaluation methodologies, and we summarize major
real-world recommendation scenarios along with their associated challenges. We
then examine how industry practitioners address these challenges in
Transaction-Oriented Recommender Systems and Content-Oriented Recommender
Systems, a new classification grounded in item characteristics and
recommendation objectives. Finally, we outline promising research directions,
including the often-overlooked role of user decision-making, the integration of
economic and psychological theories, and concrete suggestions for advancing
academic research. Our goal is to enhance academia's understanding of practical
recommender systems, bridge the growing development gap, and foster stronger
collaboration between industry and academia.

Result: 该方法简单有效，使LLM驱动的智能体能够实时处理任意大规模商品目录，而不会增加上下文窗口负担

Conclusion: 基于检索分数分布熵的动态路由策略为对话推荐系统提供了一种有效的探索-利用平衡机制，解决了大规模商品目录下的实时处理问题

Abstract: Conversational recommender systems promise rich interactions for e-commerce,
but balancing exploration (clarifying user needs) and exploitation (making
recommendations) remains challenging, especially when deploying large language
models (LLMs) with vast product catalogs. We address this challenge by modeling
the breadth of user interest via the entropy of retrieval score distributions.
Our method uses a neural retriever to fetch relevant items for a user query and
computes the entropy of the re-ranked scores to dynamically route the dialogue
policy: low-entropy (specific) queries trigger direct recommendations, whereas
high-entropy (ambiguous) queries prompt exploratory questions. This simple yet
effective strategy allows an LLM-driven agent to remain aware of an arbitrarily
large catalog in real-time without bloating its context window.

Abstract: Language fairness in multilingual information retrieval (MLIR) systems is
crucial for ensuring equitable access to information across diverse languages.
This paper sheds light on the issue, based on the assumption that queries in
different languages, but with identical semantics, should yield equivalent
ranking lists when retrieving on the same multilingual documents. We evaluate
the degree of fairness using both traditional retrieval methods, and a DPR
neural ranker based on mBERT and XLM-R. Additionally, we introduce `LaKDA', a
novel loss designed to mitigate language biases in neural MLIR approaches. Our
analysis exposes intrinsic language biases in current MLIR technologies, with
notable disparities across the retrieval methods, and the effectiveness of
LaKDA in enhancing language fairness.

Abstract: Spotify has recently introduced audiobooks as part of its catalog,
complementing its music and podcast offering. Search is often the first entry
point for users to access new items, and an important goal for Spotify is to
support users in the exploration of the audiobook catalog. More specifically,
we would like to enable users without a specific item in mind to broadly search
by topic, genre, story tropes, decade, and discover audiobooks, authors and
publishers they may like. To do this, we need to 1) inspire users to type more
exploratory queries for audiobooks and 2) augment our retrieval systems to
better deal with exploratory audiobook queries. This is challenging in a
cold-start scenario, where we have a retrievabiliy bias due to the little
amount of user interactions with audiobooks compared to previously available
items such as music and podcast content. To address this, we propose
AudioBoost, a system to boost audiobook retrievability in Spotify's Search via
synthetic query generation. AudioBoost leverages Large Language Models (LLMs)
to generate synthetic queries conditioned on audiobook metadata. The synthetic
queries are indexed both in the Query AutoComplete (QAC) and in the Search
Retrieval engine to improve query formulation and retrieval at the same time.
We show through offline evaluation that synthetic queries increase
retrievability and are of high quality. Moreover, results from an online A/B
test show that AudioBoost leads to a +0.7% in audiobook impressions, +1.22% in
audiobook clicks, and +1.82% in audiobook exploratory query completions.

Conclusion: 通过涉及LLM连续内部状态的自信度检测和动态检索机制，有效解决了RAG中的知识边界意识问题，提高了系统效果和效率

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often generate inaccurate responses
(hallucinations) when faced with questions beyond their knowledge scope.
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) addresses this by leveraging external
knowledge, but a critical challenge remains: determining whether retrieved
contexts effectively enhance the model`s ability to answer specific queries.
This challenge underscores the importance of knowledge boundary awareness,
which current methods-relying on discrete labels or limited signals-fail to
address adequately, as they overlook the rich information in LLMs` continuous
internal hidden states. To tackle this, we propose a novel post-retrieval
knowledge filtering approach. First, we construct a confidence detection model
based on LLMs` internal hidden states to quantify how retrieved contexts
enhance the model`s confidence. Using this model, we build a preference dataset
(NQ_Rerank) to fine-tune a reranker, enabling it to prioritize contexts
preferred by the downstream LLM during reranking. Additionally, we introduce
Confidence-Based Dynamic Retrieval (CBDR), which adaptively triggers retrieval
based on the LLM`s initial confidence in the original question, reducing
knowledge conflicts and improving efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate
significant improvements in accuracy for context screening and end-to-end RAG
performance, along with a notable reduction in retrieval costs while
maintaining competitive accuracy.

TL;DR: ReDI是一个基于大语言模型的三阶段推理增强查询理解方法，通过分解复杂查询、语义解释增强和结果融合，显著提升了长查询的文档检索效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI驱动搜索的发展，长形式复杂查询日益普遍，但现有LLM在查询理解方面的有效性主要在短关键词查询上评估，复杂意图的长查询研究不足。

Method: 三阶段管道：1)将复杂查询分解为针对性子查询；2)为每个子查询添加详细语义解释以改善查询-文档匹配；3)独立检索每个子查询的文档并使用融合策略聚合结果进行最终排序。

Result: 在BRIGHT和BEIR数据集上的实验表明，ReDI在稀疏和稠密检索范式中 consistently超越强基线方法。

Conclusion: ReDI方法通过推理增强的查询分解和解释，有效提升了复杂长查询的理解和文档检索性能，证明了其在现实搜索应用中的有效性。

Abstract: Accurate inference of user intent is crucial for enhancing document retrieval
in modern search engines. While large language models (LLMs) have made
significant strides in this area, their effectiveness has predominantly been
assessed with short, keyword-based queries. As AI-driven search evolves,
long-form queries with intricate intents are becoming more prevalent, yet they
remain underexplored in the context of LLM-based query understanding (QU). To
bridge this gap, we introduce ReDI: a Reasoning-enhanced approach for query
understanding through Decomposition and Interpretation. ReDI leverages the
reasoning and comprehension capabilities of LLMs in a three-stage pipeline: (i)
it breaks down complex queries into targeted sub-queries to accurately capture
user intent; (ii) it enriches each sub-query with detailed semantic
interpretations to improve the query-document matching; and (iii) it
independently retrieves documents for each sub-query and employs a fusion
strategy to aggregate the results for the final ranking. We compiled a
large-scale dataset of real-world complex queries from a major search engine
and distilled the query understanding capabilities of teacher models into
smaller models for practical application. Experiments on BRIGHT and BEIR
demonstrate that ReDI consistently surpasses strong baselines in both sparse
and dense retrieval paradigms, affirming its effectiveness.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: UniSearch是一个统一的生成式搜索框架，用端到端架构替代传统级联搜索系统，通过联合优化搜索生成器和视频编码器，结合搜索偏好优化技术，在快手搜索中实现了显著的性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统搜索引擎采用级联架构（召回、预排序、排序），多模块设计复杂且难以实现整体性能提升。现有生成式搜索方法不是真正的端到端，存在目标不一致和泛化能力有限的问题。

Method: 提出UniSearch框架：1）搜索生成器根据用户查询生成相关项目的语义标识符；2）视频编码器学习潜在项目嵌入并提供标记化表示；3）统一训练框架联合优化两个组件；4）引入搜索偏好优化（SPO）利用奖励模型和真实用户反馈来更好地对齐生成结果与用户偏好。

Result: 在工业规模数据集上的广泛实验和在线A/B测试（短视频和直播搜索场景）证明了UniSearch的强大有效性和部署潜力。在直播搜索中的部署实现了产品历史上近年来最大的单次实验改进。

Conclusion: UniSearch通过端到端的统一生成式搜索框架，解决了传统级联架构的局限性，在实际应用中展现出显著的实用价值，为现实世界的搜索应用提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Modern search systems play a crucial role in facilitating information
acquisition. Traditional search engines typically rely on a cascaded
architecture, where results are retrieved through recall, pre-ranking, and
ranking stages. The complexity of designing and maintaining multiple modules
makes it difficult to achieve holistic performance gains. Recent advances in
generative recommendation have motivated the exploration of unified generative
search as an alternative. However, existing approaches are not genuinely
end-to-end: they typically train an item encoder to tokenize candidates first
and then optimize a generator separately, leading to objective inconsistency
and limited generalization. To address these limitations, we propose UniSearch,
a unified generative search framework for Kuaishou Search. UniSearch replaces
the cascaded pipeline with an end-to-end architecture that integrates a Search
Generator and a Video Encoder. The Generator produces semantic identifiers of
relevant items given a user query, while the Video Encoder learns latent item
embeddings and provides their tokenized representations. A unified training
framework jointly optimizes both components, enabling mutual enhancement and
improving representation quality and generation accuracy. Furthermore, we
introduce Search Preference Optimization (SPO), which leverages a reward model
and real user feedback to better align generation with user preferences.
Extensive experiments on industrial-scale datasets, together with online A/B
testing in both short-video and live search scenarios, demonstrate the strong
effectiveness and deployment potential of UniSearch. Notably, its deployment in
live search yields the largest single-experiment improvement in recent years of
our product's history, highlighting its practical value for real-world
applications.

Conclusion: Perception Graph提供了一个强大且可测量的方法来检测和分析认知攻击的影响

Abstract: Augmented reality (AR) systems are increasingly deployed in tactical
environments, but their reliance on seamless human-computer interaction makes
them vulnerable to cognitive attacks that manipulate a user's perception and
severely compromise user decision-making. To address this challenge, we
introduce the Perception Graph, a novel model designed to reason about human
perception within these systems. Our model operates by first mimicking the
human process of interpreting key information from an MR environment and then
representing the outcomes using a semantically meaningful structure. We
demonstrate how the model can compute a quantitative score that reflects the
level of perception distortion, providing a robust and measurable method for
detecting and analyzing the effects of such cognitive attacks.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming supply chain management, yet
progress in predictive tasks -- such as delivery delay prediction -- remains
constrained by the scarcity of high-quality, openly available datasets.
Existing datasets are often proprietary, small, or inconsistently maintained,
hindering reproducibility and benchmarking. We present SynDelay, a synthetic
dataset designed for delivery delay prediction. Generated using an advanced
generative model trained on real-world data, SynDelay preserves realistic
delivery patterns while ensuring privacy. Although not entirely free of noise
or inconsistencies, it provides a challenging and practical testbed for
advancing predictive modelling. To support adoption, we provide baseline
results and evaluation metrics as initial benchmarks, serving as reference
points rather than state-of-the-art claims. SynDelay is publicly available
through the Supply Chain Data Hub, an open initiative promoting dataset sharing

Abstract: Automatic emotion recognition has become increasingly important with the rise
of AI, especially in fields like healthcare, education, and automotive systems.
However, there is a lack of multimodal datasets, particularly involving body
motion and physiological signals, which limits progress in the field. To
address this, the MVRS dataset is introduced, featuring synchronized recordings
from 13 participants aged 12 to 60 exposed to VR based emotional stimuli
(relaxation, fear, stress, sadness, joy). Data were collected using eye
tracking (via webcam in a VR headset), body motion (Kinect v2), and EMG and GSR
signals (Arduino UNO), all timestamp aligned. Participants followed a unified
protocol with consent and questionnaires. Features from each modality were
extracted, fused using early and late fusion techniques, and evaluated with
classifiers to confirm the datasets quality and emotion separability, making
MVRS a valuable contribution to multimodal affective computing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然大语言模型被趋势地视为个性化学习的智能助手，但在真实学习场景中的系统性对比评估仍有限。本研究旨在填补这一空白，通过实验比较不同LLM在实际教学任务中的表现。

Method: 研究使用包含学生回答和正确标签的数据集，要求三个先进LLM进行：(1)分析测验识别知识组成部分，(2)推断学生知识掌握情况，(3)生成有针对性的改进建议。采用Gemini作为虚拟评判进行双向比较，评估准确性、清晰度、可操作性和适宜性。数据分析采用Bradley-Terry模型。

Result: 分析结果显示GPT-4o通常更受偏好，能够产生更有信息量、结构更好的反馈。DeepSeek-V3和GLM-4.5虽有时显示出一些优势，但一致性较低。

Conclusion: 研究证明了LLM作为高级教学助手提供个性化支持的可行性，为未来LLM驱动的个性化学习实证研究提供了方法论指导。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly envisioned as intelligent
assistants for personalized learning, systematic head-to-head evaluations
within authentic learning scenarios remain limited. This study conducts an
empirical comparison of three state-of-the-art LLMs on a tutoring task that
simulates a realistic learning setting. Using a dataset comprising a student's
answers to ten questions of mixed formats with correctness labels, each LLM is
required to (i) analyze the quiz to identify underlying knowledge components,
(ii) infer the student's mastery profile, and (iii) generate targeted guidance
for improvement. To mitigate subjectivity and evaluator bias, we employ Gemini
as a virtual judge to perform pairwise comparisons along various dimensions:
accuracy, clarity, actionability, and appropriateness. Results analyzed via the
Bradley-Terry model indicate that GPT-4o is generally preferred, producing
feedback that is more informative and better structured than its counterparts,
while DeepSeek-V3 and GLM-4.5 demonstrate intermittent strengths but lower
consistency. These findings highlight the feasibility of deploying LLMs as
advanced teaching assistants for individualized support and provide
methodological guidance for future empirical research on LLM-driven
personalized learning.

Abstract: We introduce SasAgent, a multi-agent AI system powered by large language
models (LLMs) that automates small-angle scattering (SAS) data analysis by
leveraging tools from the SasView software and enables user interaction via
text input. SasAgent features a coordinator agent that interprets user prompts
and delegates tasks to three specialized agents for scattering length density
(SLD) calculation, synthetic data generation, and experimental data fitting.
These agents utilize LLM-friendly tools to execute tasks efficiently. These
tools, including the model data tool, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
documentation tool, bump fitting tool, and SLD calculator tool, are derived
from the SasView Python library. A user-friendly Gradio-based interface
enhances user accessibility. Through diverse examples, we demonstrate
SasAgent's ability to interpret complex prompts, calculate SLDs, generate
accurate scattering data, and fit experimental datasets with high precision.
This work showcases the potential of LLM-driven AI systems to streamline
scientific workflows and enhance automation in SAS research.

TL;DR: 本文通过自相关分析揭示了提示工程优化景观的拓扑结构，发现系统化提示生成产生平滑衰减的自相关，而多样化生成则呈现非单调模式，表明存在崎岖、分层结构的景观。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法将提示优化视为黑盒问题，应用复杂搜索算法但未描述其导航的景观拓扑结构，需要系统分析提示工程中的适应度景观结构。

Method: 使用语义嵌入空间中的自相关分析，在错误检测任务上进行实验，采用两种提示生成策略：系统枚举（1,024个提示）和新颖性驱动的多样化（1,000个提示）。

Result: 发现系统提示生成产生平滑衰减的自相关，而多样化生成呈现非单调模式，在中等语义距离处达到峰值相关性。跨10个错误检测类别的任务特定分析显示不同错误类型具有不同程度的崎岖性。

Conclusion: 研究结果为理解提示工程景观中优化的复杂性提供了实证基础，揭示了不同提示生成策略产生的根本不同的景观拓扑结构。

Abstract: While prompt engineering has emerged as a crucial technique for optimizing
large language model performance, the underlying optimization landscape remains
poorly understood. Current approaches treat prompt optimization as a black-box
problem, applying sophisticated search algorithms without characterizing the
landscape topology they navigate. We present a systematic analysis of fitness
landscape structures in prompt engineering using autocorrelation analysis
across semantic embedding spaces. Through experiments on error detection tasks
with two distinct prompt generation strategies -- systematic enumeration (1,024
prompts) and novelty-driven diversification (1,000 prompts) -- we reveal
fundamentally different landscape topologies. Systematic prompt generation
yields smoothly decaying autocorrelation, while diversified generation exhibits
non-monotonic patterns with peak correlation at intermediate semantic
distances, indicating rugged, hierarchically structured landscapes.
Task-specific analysis across 10 error detection categories reveals varying
degrees of ruggedness across different error types. Our findings provide an
empirical foundation for understanding the complexity of optimization in prompt
engineering landscapes.

Motivation: 医疗编码需要将非结构化临床记录映射到诊断和程序的字母数字代码，现有方法存在局限性，特别是对完整ICD-10系统的支持不足。

Method: 提出了Code Like Humans代理框架，实现了官方的人类专家编码指南，是首个支持完整ICD-10编码系统的解决方案。

Result: 在罕见诊断代码上取得了最佳性能表现（对于高频代码，微调判别分类器仍保持优势，但后者仅限于高频代码）。

Conclusion: 该框架为医疗编码提供了新的解决方案，同时贡献了系统性能分析和识别了系统性的"盲点"（被系统性地编码不足的代码）。

Abstract: In medical coding, experts map unstructured clinical notes to alphanumeric
codes for diagnoses and procedures. We introduce Code Like Humans: a new
agentic framework for medical coding with large language models. It implements
official coding guidelines for human experts, and it is the first solution that
can support the full ICD-10 coding system (+70K labels). It achieves the best
performance to date on rare diagnosis codes (fine-tuned discriminative
classifiers retain an advantage for high-frequency codes, to which they are
limited). Towards future work, we also contribute an analysis of system
performance and identify its `blind spots' (codes that are systematically
undercoded).

TL;DR: 本文通过KL倾斜形式提出对齐空间概念，统一解释RLHF等方法的失败模式，并提出对齐三难道和MAPS框架来帮助设计更好的对齐策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前使用人类偏好反馈的对齐方法（如RLHF、DPO等）存在重复的失败模式，需要一个统一的理论视角来理解这些问题的根源。

Method: 采用KL倾斜形式化方法，将对齐失败组织成"AI对齐默莱定律"目录，并通过小规模实验研究进行说明。

Result: 提出了对齐三难道（优化强度、价值捕获、沿半性之间的交换）和MAPS框架（误规范、注释、压力、假设偏移）来帮助理解和管理对齐问题。

Conclusion: 该研究不是一个不可能性定理，而是一种重新构建对齐辩论的视角，为未来设计提供更清晰的指导。

Abstract: Large language models are increasingly aligned to human preferences through
reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) and related methods such as
Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), Constitutional AI, and RLAIF. While
effective, these methods exhibit recurring failure patterns i.e., reward
hacking, sycophancy, annotator drift, and misgeneralization. We introduce the
concept of the Alignment Gap, a unifying lens for understanding recurring
failures in feedback-based alignment. Using a KL-tilting formalism, we
illustrate why optimization pressure tends to amplify divergence between proxy
rewards and true human intent. We organize these failures into a catalogue of
Murphys Laws of AI Alignment, and propose the Alignment Trilemma as a way to
frame trade-offs among optimization strength, value capture, and
generalization. Small-scale empirical studies serve as illustrative support.
Finally, we propose the MAPS framework (Misspecification, Annotation, Pressure,
Shift) as practical design levers. Our contribution is not a definitive
impossibility theorem but a perspective that reframes alignment debates around
structural limits and trade-offs, offering clearer guidance for future design.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统街道设计渲染方案需要大量人工工作，阻碍了公众参与和协作决策。AI辅助生成式设计虽有潜力，但现有方法需要大量领域特定数据且难以在复杂街道场景中实现精确的空间变化。

Method: 提出了一个多段径系统，集成了车道定位、提示优化、设计生成和自动评估等模块，直接在真实街道景观图像上编辑和重新设计自行车设施。

Result: 在多种城市场景中进行实验，系统能够适应不同的路径几何形状和环境条件，一质地产生视觉一致且符合指令要求的结果。

Conclusion: 这项工作为应用多段径流水线于交通基础设施规划和设施设计领域奠定了基础。

Abstract: Realistic visual renderings of street-design scenarios are essential for
public engagement in active transportation planning. Traditional approaches are
labor-intensive, hindering collective deliberation and collaborative
decision-making. While AI-assisted generative design shows transformative
potential by enabling rapid creation of design scenarios, existing generative
approaches typically require large amounts of domain-specific training data and
struggle to enable precise spatial variations of design/configuration in
complex street-view scenes. We introduce a multi-agent system that edits and
redesigns bicycle facilities directly on real-world street-view imagery. The
framework integrates lane localization, prompt optimization, design generation,
and automated evaluation to synthesize realistic, contextually appropriate
designs. Experiments across diverse urban scenarios demonstrate that the system
can adapt to varying road geometries and environmental conditions, consistently
yielding visually coherent and instruction-compliant results. This work
establishes a foundation for applying multi-agent pipelines to transportation
infrastructure planning and facility design.

### [291] [TreeGPT: A Novel Hybrid Architecture for Abstract Syntax Tree Processing with Global Parent-Child Aggregation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05550)
*Zixi Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: TreeGPT是一种新颖的神经架构，结合了transformer注意力机制和全局父子聚合，用于处理抽象语法树，在程序合成任务中取得了96%的准确率，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法要么依赖序列处理，要么使用图神经网络，无法有效捕捉AST的层次结构信息。需要一种能够同时处理局部依赖和全局树形结构的混合架构。

Method: 采用混合设计：使用self-attention捕捉局部依赖，TreeFFN通过迭代消息传递建模层次树结构。核心创新是全局父子聚合机制，支持门控聚合、残差连接和双向传播。

Result: 在ARC Prize 2025数据集上达到96%准确率，显著优于transformer基线(1.3%)、Grok-4(15.9%)和SOAR(52%)，仅使用150万参数。消融研究表明边缘投影是最关键组件。

Conclusion: TreeGPT通过结合注意力机制和树形结构建模，在程序合成任务中表现出色，证明了混合架构在处理层次数据结构方面的有效性。

Abstract: We introduce TreeGPT, a novel neural architecture that combines
transformer-based attention mechanisms with global parent-child aggregation for
processing Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs) in neural program synthesis tasks.
Unlike traditional approaches that rely solely on sequential processing or
graph neural networks, TreeGPT employs a hybrid design that leverages both
self-attention for capturing local dependencies and a specialized Tree
Feed-Forward Network (TreeFFN) for modeling hierarchical tree structures
through iterative message passing.
  The core innovation lies in our Global Parent-Child Aggregation mechanism,
formalized as: $$h_i^{(t+1)} = \sigma \Big( h_i^{(0)} + W_{pc} \sum_{(p,c) \in
E_i} f(h_p^{(t)}, h_c^{(t)}) + b \Big)$$ where $h_i^{(t)}$ represents the
hidden state of node $i$ at iteration $t$, $E_i$ denotes all parent-child edges
involving node $i$, and $f(h_p, h_c)$ is an edge aggregation function. This
formulation enables each node to progressively aggregate information from the
entire tree structure through $T$ iterations.
  Our architecture integrates optional enhancements including gated aggregation
with learnable edge weights, residual connections for gradient stability, and
bidirectional propagation for capturing both bottom-up and top-down
dependencies. We evaluate TreeGPT on the ARC Prize 2025 dataset, a challenging
visual reasoning benchmark requiring abstract pattern recognition and rule
inference. Experimental results demonstrate that TreeGPT achieves 96\%
accuracy, significantly outperforming transformer baselines (1.3\%),
large-scale models like Grok-4 (15.9\%), and specialized program synthesis
methods like SOAR (52\%) while using only 1.5M parameters. Our comprehensive
ablation study reveals that edge projection is the most critical component,
with the combination of edge projection and gating achieving optimal
performance.

*Ruixun Liu,Lingyu Kong,Derun Li,Hang Zhao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: OccVLA是一个新颖的多模态框架，通过将3D占据表示集成到统一推理过程中，解决了MLLM在3D空间理解方面的局限性，无需昂贵的手动标注即可实现自动驾驶的鲁棒空间推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态大语言模型在视觉-语言推理方面表现出色，但在3D空间理解方面存在不足，这主要源于两个挑战：缺乏可访问且有效的3D表示构建方法，以及由于缺乏大规模3D视觉-语言预训练而导致的空间细节丢失。

Method: 提出OccVLA框架，将密集3D占据既作为预测输出又作为监督信号，使模型能够直接从2D视觉输入学习细粒度空间结构。占据预测被视为隐式推理过程，在推理时可跳过而不影响性能，不增加额外计算开销。

Result: 在nuScenes基准测试中实现了轨迹规划的最先进结果，在3D视觉问答任务上表现出优越性能。

Conclusion: OccVLA提供了一个可扩展、可解释且完全基于视觉的自动驾驶解决方案，成功解决了MLLM在3D空间理解方面的关键挑战。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have shown strong vision-language
reasoning abilities but still lack robust 3D spatial understanding, which is
critical for autonomous driving. This limitation stems from two key challenges:
(1) the difficulty of constructing accessible yet effective 3D representations
without expensive manual annotations, and (2) the loss of fine-grained spatial
details in VLMs due to the absence of large-scale 3D vision-language
pretraining. To address these challenges, we propose OccVLA, a novel framework
that integrates 3D occupancy representations into a unified multimodal
reasoning process. Unlike prior approaches that rely on explicit 3D inputs,
OccVLA treats dense 3D occupancy as both a predictive output and a supervisory
signal, enabling the model to learn fine-grained spatial structures directly
from 2D visual inputs. The occupancy predictions are regarded as implicit
reasoning processes and can be skipped during inference without performance

TL;DR: MSRFormer是一个新颖的道路网络表示学习框架，通过多尺度空间交互和轨迹数据整合，解决了道路网络的异质性和层次性挑战，在道路网络分析任务中优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 城市道路网络的异质性和层次性给准确表示学习带来挑战，传统图神经网络由于同质性假设和单一结构尺度关注而表现不佳。

Method: 使用空间流卷积从大规模轨迹数据提取小尺度特征，识别尺度依赖的空间交互区域，通过图变换器捕捉多尺度复杂空间依赖，采用残差连接融合特征，最后使用对比学习算法得到最终表示。

Result: 在两个真实数据集上的验证显示，MSRFormer在道路网络分析任务中优于基线方法，在复杂道路网络结构中相比最具竞争力的基线方法有高达16%的性能提升。

Conclusion: 该研究为开发任务无关的道路网络表示模型提供了实用框架，并揭示了尺度效应与空间交互流异质性之间相互作用的独特关联模式。

Abstract: Transforming road network data into vector representations using deep
learning has proven effective for road network analysis. However, urban road
networks' heterogeneous and hierarchical nature poses challenges for accurate
representation learning. Graph neural networks, which aggregate features from
neighboring nodes, often struggle due to their homogeneity assumption and focus
on a single structural scale. To address these issues, this paper presents
MSRFormer, a novel road network representation learning framework that
integrates multi-scale spatial interactions by addressing their flow
heterogeneity and long-distance dependencies. It uses spatial flow convolution
to extract small-scale features from large trajectory datasets, and identifies
scale-dependent spatial interaction regions to capture the spatial structure of
road networks and flow heterogeneity. By employing a graph transformer,
MSRFormer effectively captures complex spatial dependencies across multiple
scales. The spatial interaction features are fused using residual connections,
which are fed to a contrastive learning algorithm to derive the final road
network representation. Validation on two real-world datasets demonstrates that
MSRFormer outperforms baseline methods in two road network analysis tasks. The
performance gains of MSRFormer suggest the traffic-related task benefits more
from incorporating trajectory data, also resulting in greater improvements in
complex road network structures with up to 16% improvements compared to the
most competitive baseline method. This research provides a practical framework
for developing task-agnostic road network representation models and highlights
distinct association patterns of the interplay between scale effects and flow
heterogeneity of spatial interactions.

Motivation: 现有基准主要关注认知层面的修改，缺乏对更深层次元认知过程的关注。需要填补这一空白，评估MLLMs在元认知知识编辑方面的能力。

Method: 提出了MIND框架：1）构建元知识记忆以实现自我意识；2）使用博弈论交互监控知识激活；3）通过标签精炼实现噪声鲁棒更新。

Result: MIND框架在传统和元认知知识编辑基准上都显著优于现有的认知编辑方法，表现出强大的性能。

Conclusion: CogEdit基准和MIND框架有效提升了多模态大语言模型的元认知知识编辑能力，为解决更深层次的认知过程提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Knowledge editing enables multimodal large language models (MLLMs) to
efficiently update outdated or incorrect information. However, existing
benchmarks primarily emphasize cognitive-level modifications while lacking a
focus on deeper meta-cognitive processes. To bridge this gap, we introduce
CogEdit, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate MLLMs' meta-cognitive knowledge
editing abilities across three levels: (1) Counterfactual-Driven Editing,
assessing self-awareness of knowledge correctness changes; (2) Boundary
Constraint Editing, ensuring appropriate generalization without unintended
interference; and (3) Noise-Robust Editing, promoting reflective evaluation of
uncertain information. To advance meta-cognitive editing, we propose MIND
(Meta-cognitive INtegrated Dynamic Knowledge Editing), a framework that
constructs a meta-knowledge memory for self-awareness, employs game-theoretic
interactions to monitor knowledge activation, and incorporates label refinement
for noise-robust updates. Extensive experiments show that MIND significantly
outperforms existing cognitive editing approaches, achieving strong performance
on both traditional and meta-cognitive knowledge editing benchmarks.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success and
demonstrated superior performance across various tasks, including natural
language processing (NLP), weather forecasting, biological protein folding,
text generation, and solving mathematical problems. However, many real-world
data exhibit highly non-Euclidean latent hierarchical anatomy, such as protein
networks, transportation networks, financial networks, brain networks, and
linguistic structures or syntactic trees in natural languages. Effectively
learning intrinsic semantic entailment and hierarchical relationships from
these raw, unstructured input data using LLMs remains an underexplored area.
Due to its effectiveness in modeling tree-like hierarchical structures,
hyperbolic geometry -- a non-Euclidean space -- has rapidly gained popularity
as an expressive latent representation space for complex data modeling across
domains such as graphs, images, languages, and multi-modal data. Here, we
provide a comprehensive and contextual exposition of recent advancements in
LLMs that leverage hyperbolic geometry as a representation space to enhance
semantic representation learning and multi-scale reasoning. Specifically, the
paper presents a taxonomy of the principal techniques of Hyperbolic LLMs
(HypLLMs) in terms of four main categories: (1) hyperbolic LLMs through exp/log
maps; (2) hyperbolic fine-tuned models; (3) fully hyperbolic LLMs, and (4)
hyperbolic state-space models. We also explore crucial potential applications
and outline future research directions. A repository of key papers, models,
datasets, and code implementations is available at

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种结合自动特征工程(AFE)和决策聚焦学习(DFL)的框架，用于解决电池能量存储系统(BESS)优化问题，在小数据集上实现更好的经济效益。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 能源管理中的不确定性参数使决策变得复杂，传统的预测-优化(PTO)方法存在预测错误导致次优决策的问题。虽然决策聚焦学习(DFL)方法能够充分整合预测和优化，但在实际应用中面临数据稀缺和变异性挑战。

Method: 提出AFE-DFL框架，利用自动特征工程提取更丰富的表征，在小数据集上预测电价和需求的同时优化BESS运作以最小化成本。在英国实际房屋数据集上进行验证。

Result: 结果显示DFL方法比PTO方法平均运营成本更低，而添加AFE后进一步提升了DFL方法的性能，相比未使用AFE的模型性能提升22.9-56.5%。

Conclusion: 这些发现为DFL在实际应用中的可行性提供了实证支撑，领域特定的AFE能够增强DFL并减少对领域专家知识的依赖，为面临类似挑战的能源管理系统带来经济效益。

Abstract: Decision-making under uncertainty in energy management is complicated by
unknown parameters hindering optimal strategies, particularly in Battery Energy
Storage System (BESS) operations. Predict-Then-Optimise (PTO) approaches treat
forecasting and optimisation as separate processes, allowing prediction errors
to cascade into suboptimal decisions as models minimise forecasting errors
rather than optimising downstream tasks. The emerging Decision-Focused Learning
(DFL) methods overcome this limitation by integrating prediction and
optimisation; however, they are relatively new and have been tested primarily
on synthetic datasets or small-scale problems, with limited evidence of their
practical viability. Real-world BESS applications present additional
challenges, including greater variability and data scarcity due to collection
constraints and operational limitations. Because of these challenges, this work
leverages Automated Feature Engineering (AFE) to extract richer representations
and improve the nascent approach of DFL. We propose an AFE-DFL framework
suitable for small datasets that forecasts electricity prices and demand while
optimising BESS operations to minimise costs. We validate its effectiveness on
a novel real-world UK property dataset. The evaluation compares DFL methods
against PTO, with and without AFE. The results show that, on average, DFL
yields lower operating costs than PTO and adding AFE further improves the
performance of DFL methods by 22.9-56.5% compared to the same models without
AFE. These findings provide empirical evidence for DFL's practical viability in
real-world settings, indicating that domain-specific AFE enhances DFL and
reduces reliance on domain expertise for BESS optimisation, yielding economic
benefits with broader implications for energy management systems facing similar
challenges.

TL;DR: NoteAid-Chatbot是一个基于多智能体LLM和强化学习的对话AI，通过'学习即对话'框架促进患者理解医疗信息，无需人工标注数据即可实现清晰、相关和结构化对话。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 患者需要具备必要的知识来积极参与自己的护理，因此需要开发能够促进患者理解的对话AI系统。

Method: 基于轻量级LLaMA 3.2 3B模型，采用两阶段训练：先在合成医疗对话数据上进行监督微调，然后通过强化学习（PPO）在模拟医院出院场景中进行奖励建模。

Result: 评估显示NoteAid-Chatbot展现出患者教育所需的关键涌现行为（清晰度、相关性、结构化对话），在图灵测试中超越了非专家人类表现。

Conclusion: 该方法证明了基于PPO的低成本强化学习在现实开放域对话中的可行性和前景，扩展了基于RL的对齐方法的应用范围。

Abstract: Patients must possess the knowledge necessary to actively participate in
their care. We present NoteAid-Chatbot, a conversational AI that promotes
patient understanding via a novel 'learning as conversation' framework, built
on a multi-agent large language model (LLM) and reinforcement learning (RL)
setup without human-labeled data. NoteAid-Chatbot was built on a lightweight
LLaMA 3.2 3B model trained in two stages: initial supervised fine-tuning on
conversational data synthetically generated using medical conversation
strategies, followed by RL with rewards derived from patient understanding
assessments in simulated hospital discharge scenarios. Our evaluation, which
includes comprehensive human-aligned assessments and case studies, demonstrates
that NoteAid-Chatbot exhibits key emergent behaviors critical for patient
education, such as clarity, relevance, and structured dialogue, even though it
received no explicit supervision for these attributes. Our results show that
even simple Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)-based reward modeling can
successfully train lightweight, domain-specific chatbots to handle multi-turn
interactions, incorporate diverse educational strategies, and meet nuanced
communication objectives. Our Turing test demonstrates that NoteAid-Chatbot
surpasses non-expert human. Although our current focus is on healthcare, the
framework we present illustrates the feasibility and promise of applying
low-cost, PPO-based RL to realistic, open-ended conversational domains,
broadening the applicability of RL-based alignment methods.

TL;DR: MapAgent是一个分层多智能体框架，专门用于地理空间推理任务，通过解耦规划与执行来提高LLM在地图集成任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI代理框架主要针对数学、编程等领域，在地理空间任务中表现不足，需要处理空间推理、多步规划和实时地图交互等复杂需求。

Method: 采用分层多智能体架构：高层规划器分解查询为子目标，路由到专用模块；针对地图工具设计专用地图工具代理并行协调相关API；简单模块无需额外代理开销。

Result: 在四个地理空间基准测试(MapEval-Textual、MapEval-API、MapEval-Visual、MapQA)上显著优于现有工具增强和代理基线方法。

Conclusion: MapAgent通过分层设计和专用工具集有效解决了地理空间推理的挑战，降低了认知负载，提高了工具选择准确性，实现了跨相似API的精确协调。

Abstract: Agentic AI has significantly extended the capabilities of large language
models (LLMs) by enabling complex reasoning and tool use. However, most
existing frameworks are tailored to domains such as mathematics, coding, or web
automation, and fall short on geospatial tasks that require spatial reasoning,
multi-hop planning, and real-time map interaction. To address these challenges,
we introduce MapAgent, a hierarchical multi-agent plug-and-play framework with
customized toolsets and agentic scaffolds for map-integrated geospatial
reasoning. Unlike existing flat agent-based approaches that treat tools
uniformly-often overwhelming the LLM when handling similar but subtly different
geospatial APIs-MapAgent decouples planning from execution. A high-level
planner decomposes complex queries into subgoals, which are routed to
specialized modules. For tool-heavy modules-such as map-based services-we then
design a dedicated map-tool agent that efficiently orchestrates related APIs
adaptively in parallel to effectively fetch geospatial data relevant for the
query, while simpler modules (e.g., solution generation or answer extraction)
operate without additional agent overhead. This hierarchical design reduces
cognitive load, improves tool selection accuracy, and enables precise
coordination across similar APIs. We evaluate MapAgent on four diverse
geospatial benchmarks-MapEval-Textual, MapEval-API, MapEval-Visual, and
MapQA-and demonstrate substantial gains over state-of-the-art tool-augmented
and agentic baselines. We open-source our framwork at
https://github.com/Hasebul/MapAgent.

TL;DR: 提出了DRER强化学习奖励框架，通过推理质量奖励和动态长度优势来优化语言模型的推理能力，在Logictree数据集上7B模型达到GPT-o3-mini水平，推理置信度提升30%


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于规则的奖励函数只评估答案格式和正确性，无法判断推理链是否真正提升答案质量，且任务特定训练对逻辑深度的控制有限

Method: DRER框架包含：(1)推理质量奖励 - 对提升正确答案概率的推理链给予细粒度奖励；(2)动态长度优势 - 对偏离验证阈值的响应长度进行优势衰减

Result: 7B模型在400训练步后达到GPT-o3-mini水平，CoT增强答案的平均置信度提升30%，在多种逻辑推理数据集和AIME24数学基准上表现出良好泛化能力

Conclusion: DRER有效塑造了CoT行为，为增强大语言模型的形式推理能力提供了实用路径

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has recently become the dominant paradigm for
strengthening the reasoning abilities of large language models (LLMs). Yet the
rule-based reward functions commonly used on mathematical or programming
benchmarks assess only answer format and correctness, providing no signal as to
whether the induced Chain-of-Thought (CoT) actually improves the answer.
Furthermore, such task-specific training offers limited control over logical
depth and therefore may fail to reveal a model's genuine reasoning capacity. We
propose Dynamic Reasoning Efficiency Reward (DRER) -- a plug-and-play RL reward
framework that reshapes both reward and advantage signals. (i) A Reasoning
Quality Reward assigns fine-grained credit to those reasoning chains that
demonstrably raise the likelihood of the correct answer, directly incentivising
the trajectories with beneficial CoT tokens. (ii) A Dynamic Length Advantage
decays the advantage of responses whose length deviates from a
validation-derived threshold, stabilising training. To facilitate rigorous
assessment, we also release Logictree, a dynamically constructed deductive
reasoning dataset that functions both as RL training data and as a
comprehensive benchmark. Experiments confirm the effectiveness of DRER: our 7B
model attains GPT-o3-mini level performance on Logictree with 400 trianing
steps, while the average confidence of CoT-augmented answers rises by 30%. The
model further exhibits generalisation across diverse logical-reasoning
datasets, and the mathematical benchmark AIME24. These results illuminate how
RL shapes CoT behaviour and chart a practical path toward enhancing
formal-reasoning skills in large language models. All code and data are
available in repository https://github.com/Henryhe09/DRER.

Result: 构建了DeepWriting-20K大规模数据集（2万条深度推理轨迹），训练的DeepWriter-8B模型超越开源基线，性能与GPT-4o、Claude 3.5等专有模型相当甚至更优

Conclusion: REER范式为开放式创作任务的深度推理提供了新的有效途径，通过逆向工程方法成功解决了传统方法的局限性

Abstract: While the ``deep reasoning'' paradigm has spurred significant advances in
verifiable domains like mathematics, its application to open-ended, creative
generation remains a critical challenge. The two dominant methods for
instilling reasoning -- reinforcement learning (RL) and instruction
distillation -- falter in this area; RL struggles with the absence of clear
reward signals and high-quality reward models, while distillation is
prohibitively expensive and capped by the teacher model's capabilities. To
overcome these limitations, we introduce REverse-Engineered Reasoning (REER), a
new paradigm that fundamentally shifts the approach. Instead of building a
reasoning process ``forwards'' through trial-and-error or imitation, REER works
``backwards'' from known-good solutions to computationally discover the latent,
step-by-step deep reasoning process that could have produced them. Using this
scalable, gradient-free approach, we curate and open-source DeepWriting-20K, a
large-scale dataset of 20,000 deep reasoning trajectories for open-ended tasks.
Our model, DeepWriter-8B, trained on this data, not only surpasses strong
open-source baselines but also achieves performance competitive with, and at
times superior to, leading proprietary models like GPT-4o and Claude 3.5.

Motivation: 大型推理模型(LRMs)在处理简单问题时容易过度思考，产生冗长复杂的推理轨迹，影响可解释性和效率。需要解决多生成目标(正确性和简洁性)之间的平衡难题。

Method: 提出EDIT(Efficient Dynamic Inference Trimming)方法，采用约束引导生成，同时在不同约束下联合跟踪长度和答案分布，选择在简洁性和正确性之间达到最佳平衡的响应。

Result: 在多种模型和数据集上的广泛实验表明，EDIT显著提高了推理效率，产生紧凑而信息丰富的输出，改善了可读性和用户体验。

Conclusion: EDIT方法有效解决了大型推理模型的过度思考问题，通过动态推理修剪实现了推理效率的显著提升，为复杂推理任务提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: O1/R1 style large reasoning models (LRMs) signal a substantial leap forward
over conventional instruction-following LLMs. By applying test-time scaling to
generate extended reasoning paths, they establish many SOTAs across a wide
range of complex reasoning tasks. However, recent studies show that LRMs are
prone to suffer from overthinking -- the tendency to overcomplicate simple
problems, leading to excessive strategy switching and long, convoluted
reasoning traces that hinder their interpretability. To mitigate this issue, we
conduct a systematic investigation into the reasoning efficiency of a broad set
of LRMs and uncover a common dilemma: the difficulty in balancing multiple
generation objectives such as correctness and brevity. Based on this discovery,
we propose a test-time scaling method, EDIT (Efficient Dynamic Inference
Trimming), which efficiently guides LRMs to identify the shortest correct
reasoning paths at test time. EDIT employs constraint-guided generation while
jointly tracking length and answer distributions under varying constraints,
allowing it to select responses that strike an optimal balance between
conciseness and correctness. Extensive experiments across diverse models and
datasets show that EDIT substantially enhance the reasoning efficiency,
producing compact yet informative outputs that improve readability and user
experience.

Conclusion: 该工作展示了一个强大、可扩展且自动化的流程，用于LLM驱动的形式验证硬件合成，连接了自然语言规范和硅实现

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in
automated code generation but frequently produce code that fails formal
verification, an essential requirement for hardware and safety-critical
domains. To overcome this fundamental limitation, we previously proposed
PREFACE, a model-agnostic framework based on reinforcement learning (RL) that
iteratively repairs the prompts provided to frozen LLMs, systematically
steering them toward generating formally verifiable Dafny code without costly
fine-tuning. This work presents Proof2Silicon, a novel end-to-end synthesis
framework that embeds the previously proposed PREFACE flow to enable the
generation of correctness-by-construction hardware directly from natural
language specifications. Proof2Silicon operates by: (1) leveraging PREFACE's
verifier-driven RL agent to optimize prompt generation iteratively, ensuring
Dafny code correctness; (2) automatically translating verified Dafny programs
into synthesizable high-level C using Dafny's Python backend and PyLog; and (3)
employing Vivado HLS to produce RTL implementations. Evaluated rigorously on a
challenging 100-task benchmark, PREFACE's RL-guided prompt optimization
consistently improved Dafny verification success rates across diverse LLMs by
up to 21%. Crucially, Proof2Silicon achieved an end-to-end hardware synthesis
success rate of up to 72%, generating RTL designs through Vivado HLS synthesis
flows. These results demonstrate a robust, scalable, and automated pipeline for
LLM-driven, formally verified hardware synthesis, bridging natural-language
specification and silicon realization.

explainable, personalized recommendations in domains like fashion, personal
wellness, and lifestyle planning. Our architecture uses a personal causal graph
of the user's life events and habits, performs goal directed causal traversals
enriched with external knowledge and hypothetical reasoning, and retrieves
adaptable plan schemas to generate tailored action plans. A Large Language
Model orchestrates these components, producing answers with transparent causal
explanations. We outline the CSM system design and introduce new evaluation
metrics for personalization and explainability, including Personalization
Salience Score and Causal Reasoning Accuracy, to rigorously assess its
performance. Results indicate that CSM based agents can provide more context
aware, user aligned recommendations compared to baseline LLM agents. This work
demonstrates a novel approach to memory augmented, causal reasoning in
personalized agents, advancing the development of transparent and trustworthy
AI lifestyle assistants.

TL;DR: TableMind是一个LLM驱动的表格推理代理，通过自主工具调用、代码执行和自适应策略，在表格推理任务中实现了卓越的性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于文本的表格推理方法在复杂数值计算方面存在困难，而工具集成方法又缺乏真正的自主适应性，需要更智能的解决方案

Method: 采用两阶段微调范式：监督微调建立有效工具使用模式，强化微调优化多目标策略，并提出Rank-Aware Policy Optimization (RAPO)方法

Result: 在多个主流基准测试中，TableMind相比竞争基线实现了卓越性能，在推理准确性和计算精度方面都有显著提升

Conclusion: TableMind通过自主工具调用、安全代码执行和自适应策略，为表格推理任务提供了有效的解决方案，展示了在复杂数值计算任务中的优势

Abstract: Table reasoning is crucial for leveraging structured data in domains such as
finance, healthcare, and scientific research. While large language models
(LLMs) show promise in multi-step reasoning, purely text-based methods often
struggle with the complex numerical computations and fine-grained operations
inherently required in this task. Tool-integrated reasoning improves
computational accuracy via explicit code execution, yet existing systems
frequently rely on rigid patterns, supervised imitation, and lack true
autonomous adaptability. In this paper, we present TableMind, an LLM-driven
table reasoning agent that (i) autonomously performs multi-turn tool
invocation, (ii) writes and executes data-analyzing code in a secure sandbox
environment for data analysis and precise numerical reasoning, and (iii)
exhibits high-level capabilities such as planning and self-reflection to adapt
strategies. To realize these capabilities, we adopt a two-stage fine-tuning
paradigm built on top of a powerful pre-trained language model: supervised
fine-tuning on high-quality reasoning trajectories to establish effective tool
usage patterns, followed by reinforcement fine-tuning to optimize
multi-objective strategies. In particular, we propose Rank-Aware Policy
Optimization (RAPO), which increases the update weight of high-quality
trajectories when their output probabilities are lower than those of
low-quality ones, thereby guiding the model more consistently toward better and
more accurate answers. Extensive experiments on several mainstream benchmarks
demonstrate that TableMind achieves superior performance compared to
competitive baselines, yielding substantial gains in both reasoning accuracy
and computational precision.

Abstract: Equipping large language models (LLMs) with complex, interleaved reasoning
and tool-use capabilities has become a key focus in agentic AI research,
especially with recent advances in reasoning-oriented (``thinking'') models.
Such capabilities are key to unlocking a number of important applications. One
such application is Deep Research (DR), which requires extensive search and
reasoning over many sources. Our work in this paper focuses on the development
of native Autonomous Single-Agent models for DR featuring minimal web crawling
and Python tool integration. Unlike multi-agent systems, where agents take up
pre-defined roles and are told what to do at each step in a static workflow, an
autonomous single-agent determines its next action dynamically based on
context, without manual directive. While prior work has proposed training
recipes for base or instruction-tuned LLMs, we focus on continual reinforcement
learning (RL) of reasoning-optimized models to further enhance agentic skills
while preserving reasoning ability. Towards this end, we propose a simple RL
recipe with entirely synthetic data, which we apply to various open-source
LLMs. Our best variant SFR-DR-20B achieves up to 28.7% on Humanity's Last Exam
benchmark. In addition, we conduct key analysis experiments to provide more
insights into our methodologies.

Motivation: 现有大语言模型的推理方法依赖隐式探索，导致推理路径不稳定、缺乏错误纠正机制、无法从过往经验中学习

Method: 从成功轨迹中提取结构化推理模式，从失败中获取反思信号；推理时模型遵循指导原则逐步执行，每一步后进行精炼以纠正错误和稳定推理过程

Result: 在BBH、GSM8K、MATH-500、MBPP、HumanEval等五个基准测试中均优于强基线，结构化推理提高了稳定性和泛化能力

Conclusion: 结构化推理通过逐步执行和精炼机制有效提升推理性能，指导原则具有良好的跨领域迁移能力，支持跨模型协作，在效果和可扩展性上达到或超过监督微调

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have advanced general-purpose reasoning, showing
strong performance across diverse tasks. However, existing methods often rely
on implicit exploration, where the model follows stochastic and unguided
reasoning paths-like walking without a map. This leads to unstable reasoning
paths, lack of error correction, and limited learning from past experience. To
address these issues, we propose a framework that shifts from implicit
exploration to structured reasoning through guideline and refinement. First, we
extract structured reasoning patterns from successful trajectories and
reflective signals from failures. During inference, the model follows these
guidelines step-by-step, with refinement applied after each step to correct
errors and stabilize the reasoning process. Experiments on BBH and four
additional benchmarks (GSM8K, MATH-500, MBPP, HumanEval) show that our method
consistently outperforms strong baselines across diverse reasoning tasks.
Structured reasoning with stepwise execution and refinement improves stability
and generalization, while guidelines transfer well across domains and flexibly
support cross-model collaboration, matching or surpassing supervised
fine-tuning in effectiveness and scalability.

*Lei Shu,Dong Zhao*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 评估7个大型语言模型在住宅节能改造决策中的表现，发现LLM在技术目标上表现更好，但需要提高准确性、一致性和上下文处理能力才能可靠应用


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统建筑节能改造决策方法通用性有限且可解释性低，阻碍了在多样化住宅场景中的采用。随着智能社区的发展，生成式AI特别是LLM可能通过处理上下文信息来提供可读建议

Method: 评估7个LLM（ChatGPT、DeepSeek、Gemini、Grok、Llama和Claude）在住宅改造决策中的表现，基于两个目标：最大化CO2减排（技术性）和最小化投资回收期（社会技术性）。使用包含49个州400个住宅的数据集，从准确性、一致性、敏感性和推理四个维度进行评估

Result: LLM在许多情况下能生成有效建议，无需微调即可达到54.5%的top 1匹配率和92.8%的top 5匹配率。技术目标表现更强，社会技术决策受经济权衡和本地背景限制。模型间一致性低，高性能模型往往与其他模型不同。对位置和建筑几何敏感，但对技术和居住者行为不敏感

Conclusion: LLM在能源改造决策中是很有前景的助手，但需要在准确性、一致性和上下文处理方面进行改进才能实现可靠实践

Abstract: Conventional approaches to building energy retrofit decision making suffer
from limited generalizability and low interpretability, hindering adoption in
diverse residential contexts. With the growth of Smart and Connected
Communities, generative AI, especially large language models (LLMs), may help
by processing contextual information and producing practitioner readable
recommendations. We evaluate seven LLMs (ChatGPT, DeepSeek, Gemini, Grok,
Llama, and Claude) on residential retrofit decisions under two objectives:
maximizing CO2 reduction (technical) and minimizing payback period
(sociotechnical). Performance is assessed on four dimensions: accuracy,
consistency, sensitivity, and reasoning, using a dataset of 400 homes across 49
US states. LLMs generate effective recommendations in many cases, reaching up
to 54.5 percent top 1 match and 92.8 percent within top 5 without fine tuning.
Performance is stronger for the technical objective, while sociotechnical
decisions are limited by economic trade offs and local context. Agreement
across models is low, and higher performing models tend to diverge from others.
LLMs are sensitive to location and building geometry but less sensitive to
technology and occupant behavior. Most models show step by step, engineering
style reasoning, but it is often simplified and lacks deeper contextual
awareness. Overall, LLMs are promising assistants for energy retrofit decision
making, but improvements in accuracy, consistency, and context handling are
needed for reliable practice.

Conclusion: 本研究为LLM驱动的调查模拟建立了严谨的基础，为社会学研究和政策评估提供了可扩展和成本效益更好的工具。

Abstract: Questionnaire-based surveys are foundational to social science research and
public policymaking, yet traditional survey methods remain costly,
time-consuming, and often limited in scale. This paper explores a new paradigm:
simulating virtual survey respondents using Large Language Models (LLMs). We
introduce two novel simulation settings, namely Partial Attribute Simulation
(PAS) and Full Attribute Simulation (FAS), to systematically evaluate the
ability of LLMs to generate accurate and demographically coherent responses. In
PAS, the model predicts missing attributes based on partial respondent
profiles, whereas FAS involves generating complete synthetic datasets under
both zero-context and context-enhanced conditions. We curate a comprehensive
benchmark suite, LLM-S^3 (Large Language Model-based Sociodemographic Survey
Simulation), that spans 11 real-world public datasets across four sociological
domains. Our evaluation of multiple mainstream LLMs (GPT-3.5/4 Turbo, LLaMA
3.0/3.1-8B) reveals consistent trends in prediction performance, highlights
failure modes, and demonstrates how context and prompt design impact simulation
fidelity. This work establishes a rigorous foundation for LLM-driven survey
simulations, offering scalable and cost-effective tools for sociological
research and policy evaluation. Our code and dataset are available at:

Abstract: In online second-hand marketplaces, multi-turn bargaining is a crucial part
of seller-buyer interactions. Large Language Models (LLMs) can act as seller
agents, negotiating with buyers on behalf of sellers under given business
constraints. A critical ability for such agents is to track and accurately
interpret cumulative buyer intents across long negotiations, which directly
impacts bargaining effectiveness. We introduce a multi-turn evaluation
framework for measuring the bargaining ability of seller agents in e-commerce
dialogues. The framework tests whether an agent can extract and track buyer
intents. Our contributions are: (1) a large-scale e-commerce bargaining
benchmark spanning 622 categories, 9,892 products, and 3,014 tasks; (2) a
turn-level evaluation framework grounded in Theory of Mind (ToM) with annotated
buyer intents, moving beyond outcome-only metrics; and (3) an automated
pipeline that extracts reliable intent from massive dialogue data.

Abstract: Modern simulation environments for complex multi-agent interactions must
balance high-fidelity detail with computational efficiency. We present DECOY, a
novel multi-agent simulator that abstracts strategic, long-horizon planning in
3D terrains into high-level discretized simulation while preserving low-level
environmental fidelity. Using Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO) as a
testbed, our framework accurately simulates gameplay using only movement

system that simplifies and discretizes continuous states and actions, paired
with neural predictive and generative models trained on real CS:GO tournament

DiagCoT combines contrastive image-report tuning for domain alignment,
chain-of-thought supervision to capture inferential logic, and reinforcement

Conclusion: TOA框架有效缓解了位置偏见和幻觉问题，实现了多视角理解，在可比的API开销下获得了显著的性能提升

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) face persistent challenges when handling
long-context tasks, most notably the lost in the middle issue, where
information located in the middle of a long input tends to be underutilized.
Some existing methods that reduce input have the risk of discarding key
information, while others that extend context windows often lead to attention
dispersion. To address these limitations, we propose Tree of Agents (TOA), a
multi-agent reasoning framework that segments the input into chunks processed
by independent agents. Each agent generates its local cognition, then agents
dynamically exchange information for collaborative reasoning along
tree-structured paths. TOA enables agents to probe different reasoning orders
for multi-perspective understanding, effectively mitigating position bias and
reducing hallucinations. To improve processing efficiency, we incorporate
prefix-hash caching and adaptive pruning strategies, achieving significant
performance improvements with comparable API overhead. Experiments show that
TOA, powered by compact LLaMA3.1-8B, significantly outperforms multiple
baselines and demonstrates comparable performance to the latest and much larger
commercial models, such as Gemini1.5-pro, on various long-context tasks. Code

Motivation: 集中式RAG系统在处理异构隐私敏感数据时面临困难，特别是在分布式医疗环境中，患者数据涉及SQL、知识图谱和临床笔记等多种格式，且受隐私约束限制临床医生检索罕见病例。

Method: 基于Flower设计边缘-云协作RAG框架，支持查询结构化SQL数据、半结构化知识图谱和非结构化文档；边缘LLM将数据转换为标准化隐私保护表示，服务器LLM进行全局推理；集成轻量级本地检索器和隐私感知LLM，提供三种匿名化工具；设计三层缓存策略优化延迟。

Conclusion: 该框架为结构异构数据上的RAG提供了可扩展且符合隐私要求的解决方案，在敏感和多样化数据环境中释放了LLMs的潜力。

Abstract: Centralized RAG pipelines struggle with heterogeneous and privacy-sensitive
data, especially in distributed healthcare settings where patient data spans
SQL, knowledge graphs, and clinical notes. Clinicians face difficulties
retrieving rare disease cases due to privacy constraints and the limitations of
traditional cloud-based RAG systems in handling diverse formats and edge
devices. To address this, we introduce HyFedRAG, a unified and efficient
Federated RAG framework tailored for Hybrid data modalities. By leveraging an
edge-cloud collaborative mechanism, HyFedRAG enables RAG to operate across
diverse data sources while preserving data privacy. Our key contributions are:
(1) We design an edge-cloud collaborative RAG framework built on Flower, which
supports querying structured SQL data, semi-structured knowledge graphs, and
unstructured documents. The edge-side LLMs convert diverse data into
standardized privacy-preserving representations, and the server-side LLMs
integrates them for global reasoning and generation. (2) We integrate
lightweight local retrievers with privacy-aware LLMs and provide three
anonymization tools that enable each client to produce semantically rich,
de-identified summaries for global inference across devices. (3) To optimize
response latency and reduce redundant computation, we design a three-tier
caching strategy consisting of local cache, intermediate representation cache,
and cloud inference cache. Experimental results on PMC-Patients demonstrate
that HyFedRAG outperforms existing baselines in terms of retrieval quality,
generation consistency, and system efficiency. Our framework offers a scalable
and privacy-compliant solution for RAG over structural-heterogeneous data,
unlocking the potential of LLMs in sensitive and diverse data environments.

Method: 首先研究指令数据集分布与对齐模型性能关系的关键因素，发现指令深度和语义空间覆盖率是决定下游性能的关键因素。然后设计指令选择算法，同时最大化所选指令的深度和语义覆盖率。

Result: 实验结果表明，相比最先进的基线方法，该方法能够以更快的速度持续提升模型性能，可解释开发集上70%以上的模型损失。

Conclusion: 指令深度和语义覆盖率是影响对齐模型性能的关键因素，提出的指令选择方法能够有效实现加速扩展，为大语言模型的高效对齐提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: With the growing demand for applying large language models to downstream
tasks, improving model alignment performance and efficiency has become crucial.
Such a process involves selecting informative instructions from a candidate
pool. However, due to the complexity of instruction set distributions, the key
factors driving the performance of aligned models remain unclear. As a result,
current instruction set refinement methods fail to improve performance as the
instruction pool expands continuously. To address this issue, we first
investigate the key factors that influence the relationship between instruction
dataset distribution and aligned model performance. Based on these insights, we
propose a novel instruction data selection method. We identify that the depth
of instructions and the coverage of the semantic space are the crucial factors
determining downstream performance, which could explain over 70\% of the model
loss on the development set. We then design an instruction selection algorithm
to simultaneously maximize the depth and semantic coverage of the selected
instructions. Experimental results demonstrate that, compared to
state-of-the-art baseline methods, it can sustainably improve model performance
at a faster pace and thus achieve \emph{``Accelerated Scaling''}.

Abstract: To enhance the efficiency of GUI agents on various platforms like smartphones
and computers, a hybrid paradigm that combines flexible GUI operations with
efficient shortcuts (e.g., API, deep links) is emerging as a promising
direction. However, a framework for systematically benchmarking these hybrid
agents is still underexplored. To take the first step in bridging this gap, we
introduce MAS-Bench, a benchmark that pioneers the evaluation of GUI-shortcut
hybrid agents with a specific focus on the mobile domain. Beyond merely using
predefined shortcuts, MAS-Bench assesses an agent's capability to autonomously
generate shortcuts by discovering and creating reusable, low-cost workflows. It
features 139 complex tasks across 11 real-world applications, a knowledge base
of 88 predefined shortcuts (APIs, deep-links, RPA scripts), and 7 evaluation
metrics. The tasks are designed to be solvable via GUI-only operations, but can
be significantly accelerated by intelligently embedding shortcuts. Experiments
show that hybrid agents achieve significantly higher success rates and
efficiency than their GUI-only counterparts. This result also demonstrates the
effectiveness of our method for evaluating an agent's shortcut generation
capabilities. MAS-Bench fills a critical evaluation gap, providing a
foundational platform for future advancements in creating more efficient and
robust intelligent agents.

Abstract: In supply chain management, decision-making often involves balancing multiple
conflicting objectives, such as cost reduction, service level improvement, and
environmental sustainability. Traditional multi-objective optimization methods,
such as linear programming and evolutionary algorithms, struggle to adapt in
real-time to the dynamic nature of supply chains. In this paper, we propose an
approach that combines Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Multi-Objective
Evolutionary Algorithms (MOEAs) to address these challenges for dynamic
multi-objective optimization under uncertainty. Our method leverages MOEAs to
search the parameter space of policy neural networks, generating a Pareto front
of policies. This provides decision-makers with a diverse population of
policies that can be dynamically switched based on the current system
objectives, ensuring flexibility and adaptability in real-time decision-making.
We also introduce Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) to incorporate
risk-sensitive decision-making, enhancing resilience in uncertain environments.
We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through case studies,
showcasing its ability to respond to supply chain dynamics and outperforming
state-of-the-art methods in an inventory management case study. The proposed
strategy not only improves decision-making efficiency but also offers a more
robust framework for managing uncertainty and optimizing performance in supply
chains.

TL;DR: BFS-Prover-V2是一个解决LLM在定理证明中训练和推理双重扩展问题的系统，通过多轮离线RL框架和规划增强的多智能体搜索架构，在形式数学基准测试中实现了最先进的结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在自动定理证明中的应用面临训练时强化学习和推理时计算资源扩展的双重挑战，需要突破性能瓶颈和搜索空间限制。

Method: 1) 多轮离线RL框架：受AlphaZero启发，采用多阶段专家迭代流程，包含自适应策略级数据过滤和定期重训练；2) 规划增强的多智能体搜索架构：使用通用推理模型作为高级规划器分解复杂定理，通过共享证明缓存实现并行证明智能体协作。

Result: 在MiniF2F测试集上达到95.08%，在ProofNet测试集上达到41.4%，在形式数学基准测试中取得了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 该系统通过双重扩展方法有效解决了LLM定理证明的扩展问题，所提出的RL和推理技术具有广泛适用性，可应用于其他需要长时程多轮推理和复杂搜索的领域。

Abstract: The integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) into automated theorem
proving has shown immense promise, yet is fundamentally constrained by
challenges in scaling up both training-time reinforcement learning (RL) and
inference-time compute. This paper introduces \texttt{BFS-Prover-V2}, a system
designed to address this dual scaling problem. We present two primary
innovations. The first is a novel multi-turn off-policy RL framework for
continually improving the performance of LLM step-prover at training time. This
framework, inspired by the principles of AlphaZero, utilizes a multi-stage
expert iteration pipeline featuring adaptive tactic-level data filtering and
periodic retraining to surmount the performance plateaus that typically curtail
long-term RL in LLM-based agents. The second innovation is a planner-enhanced
multi-agent search architecture that scales reasoning capabilities at inference
time. This architecture employs a general reasoning model as a high-level
planner to iteratively decompose complex theorems into a sequence of simpler
subgoals. This hierarchical approach substantially reduces the search space,
enabling a team of parallel prover agents to collaborate efficiently by
leveraging a shared proof cache. We demonstrate that this dual approach to
scaling yields state-of-the-art results on established formal mathematics
benchmarks. \texttt{BFS-Prover-V2} achieves 95.08\% and 41.4\% on the MiniF2F
and ProofNet test sets respectively. While demonstrated in the domain of formal
mathematics, the RL and inference techniques presented in this work are of
broader interest and may be applied to other domains requiring long-horizon
multi-turn reasoning and complex search.

Motivation: 解决科学发现中手动创建计算实验软件的瓶颈问题，加速科学进步

Method: 结合大语言模型(LLM)和树搜索(TS)方法，系统性地改进质量指标并智能探索解决方案空间

Abstract: The cycle of scientific discovery is frequently bottlenecked by the slow,
manual creation of software to support computational experiments. To address
this, we present an AI system that creates expert-level scientific software
whose goal is to maximize a quality metric. The system uses a Large Language
Model (LLM) and Tree Search (TS) to systematically improve the quality metric
and intelligently navigate the large space of possible solutions. The system
achieves expert-level results when it explores and integrates complex research
ideas from external sources. The effectiveness of tree search is demonstrated
across a wide range of benchmarks. In bioinformatics, it discovered 40 novel
methods for single-cell data analysis that outperformed the top human-developed
methods on a public leaderboard. In epidemiology, it generated 14 models that
outperformed the CDC ensemble and all other individual models for forecasting
COVID-19 hospitalizations. Our method also produced state-of-the-art software
for geospatial analysis, neural activity prediction in zebrafish, time series
forecasting and numerical solution of integrals. By devising and implementing
novel solutions to diverse tasks, the system represents a significant step
towards accelerating scientific progress.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种以"意图草稿"为核心的零检验多模态推理组件，通过任务分解和策略选择来充分利用上下文信息，提升复杂跨模态推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多模态大模型在复杂跨模态推理中存在的"短接"问题和上下文理解不充问题，提高模型的跨模态理解能力。

Method: 设计了一个插拔式三模块流水线：意图感知器、策略生成器和策略选择器，通过明确构建"理解-规划-选择"的认知过程来生成和筛选意图草稿策略。无需参数微调，仅通过上下文工程实现跨模型转移。

Result: 在IntentBench、WorldSense和Daily-Omni数据集上验证了方法的普适性和稳健性能提升。与各自基线相比，完整的"三模块"方案在不同推理引擎和流水线组合中均实现了一致性提升，最高提升约9.51个百分点。

Conclusion: 信息论分析显示该方法能够降低条件熵和提高信息利用效率，抑制意外的短接推理。"意图草稿"推理组件在零检验场景中具有实用价值和可移植性。

Abstract: Targeting the issues of "shortcuts" and insufficient contextual understanding
in complex cross-modal reasoning of multimodal large models, this paper
proposes a zero-shot multimodal reasoning component guided by human-like
cognitive strategies centered on an "intent sketch". The component comprises a
plug-and-play three-module pipeline-Intent Perceiver, Strategy Generator, and
Strategy Selector-that explicitly constructs a "understand-plan-select"
cognitive process. By generating and filtering "intent sketch" strategies to
guide the final reasoning, it requires no parameter fine-tuning and achieves
cross-model transfer solely through in-context engineering.
Information-theoretic analysis shows that this process can reduce conditional
entropy and improve information utilization efficiency, thereby suppressing
unintended shortcut reasoning. Experiments on IntentBench, WorldSense, and
Daily-Omni validate the method's generality and robust gains; compared with
their respective baselines, the complete "three-module" scheme yields
consistent improvements across different reasoning engines and pipeline
combinations, with gains up to approximately 9.51 percentage points,
demonstrating the practical value and portability of the "intent sketch"
reasoning component in zero-shot scenarios.

Motivation: 当前深度研究系统存在偏移、暴露偏差等问题，偏好对齐方法存在方案依赖性强、远离策略等限制，而强化学习能够更好地解决这些问题。

Method: 从三个轴心系统化分析：(i)数据合成与管理；(ii)代理研究RL方法（稳定性、样本效率、长上下文处理、奖励设计等）；(iii)代理RL训练系统和框架。还包括代理架构、协调以及评估标准。

Conclusion: 强化学习在深度研究系统中具有重要价值，能够优化轨迹级策略、支持探索和恢复行为，减少对人类先验知识的依赖，是建立健壮代理系统的关键技术。

Abstract: Deep research systems, agentic AI that solve complex, multi-step tasks by
coordinating reasoning, search across the open web and user files, and tool
use, are moving toward hierarchical deployments with a Planner, Coordinator,
and Executors. In practice, training entire stacks end-to-end remains
impractical, so most work trains a single planner connected to core tools such
as search, browsing, and code. While SFT imparts protocol fidelity, it suffers
from imitation and exposure biases and underuses environment feedback.
Preference alignment methods such as DPO are schema and proxy-dependent,
off-policy, and weak for long-horizon credit assignment and multi-objective
trade-offs. A further limitation of SFT and DPO is their reliance on human
defined decision points and subskills through schema design and labeled
comparisons. Reinforcement learning aligns with closed-loop, tool-interaction
research by optimizing trajectory-level policies, enabling exploration,
recovery behaviors, and principled credit assignment, and it reduces dependence
on such human priors and rater biases.
  This survey is, to our knowledge, the first dedicated to the RL foundations
of deep research systems. It systematizes work after DeepSeek-R1 along three
axes: (i) data synthesis and curation; (ii) RL methods for agentic research
covering stability, sample efficiency, long context handling, reward and credit
design, multi-objective optimization, and multimodal integration; and (iii)
agentic RL training systems and frameworks. We also cover agent architecture
and coordination, as well as evaluation and benchmarks, including recent QA,
VQA, long-form synthesis, and domain-grounded, tool-interaction tasks. We
distill recurring patterns, surface infrastructure bottlenecks, and offer
practical guidance for training robust, transparent deep research agents with
RL.

<details>

Motivation: 智能座舱API代理面临紧密耦合子系统的协调挑战，传统函数调用方法无状态、需要多次探索性调用，导致效率低下和错误恢复能力有限

Method: 开发了VehicleWorld环境（30个模块、250个API、680个属性），提出SFC方法，维护显式系统状态感知并实现直接状态转换

Result: SFC方法显著优于传统FC方法，实现了更高的执行准确性和更低的延迟

Conclusion: 状态预测比函数调用更适合环境控制，SFC为智能座舱API代理提供了更有效的解决方案

Abstract: Intelligent vehicle cockpits present unique challenges for API Agents,
requiring coordination across tightly-coupled subsystems that exceed typical
task environments' complexity. Traditional Function Calling (FC) approaches
operate statelessly, requiring multiple exploratory calls to build
environmental awareness before execution, leading to inefficiency and limited
error recovery. We introduce VehicleWorld, the first comprehensive environment
for the automotive domain, featuring 30 modules, 250 APIs, and 680 properties
with fully executable implementations that provide real-time state information
during agent execution. This environment enables precise evaluation of vehicle
agent behaviors across diverse, challenging scenarios. Through systematic
analysis, we discovered that direct state prediction outperforms function
calling for environmental control. Building on this insight, we propose
State-based Function Call (SFC), a novel approach that maintains explicit
system state awareness and implements direct state transitions to achieve
target conditions. Experimental results demonstrate that SFC significantly
outperforms traditional FC approaches, achieving superior execution accuracy
and reduced latency. We have made all implementation code publicly available on
Github https://github.com/OpenMOSS/VehicleWorld.

*Shashidhar Reddy Javaji,Bhavul Gauri,Zining Zhu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一个评估框架，用于量化分析大语言模型在多轮迭代精细化任务中的表现，并探索不同提示策略和迭代次数对代码、数学和思想创造任务的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然大语言模型已经被广泛用于多轮工作流程，但目前仍缺乏明确的方法来量化评估迭代精细化的效果，不知道什么时候迭代能够提升性能，什么时候反而会造成负面影响。

Method: 研究设计了一个控制评估协议，在每个任务中进行12轮对话。使用了从模糊的"改进它"反馈到有针对性导航的多种提示策略，并记录每轮输出。通过域适应性检查（代码的单元测试、数学的答案等价性和推理合理性、思想创造的原创性和可行性）来评分结果，并使用三类指标跟踪每轮行为：语义移动、轮到轮变化和输出大小增长。

Result: 研究发现收益具有领域依赖性：思想创造和代码任务在前几轮就能获得收益，而数学任务在后期轮次中通过详细提示才能获得显著收益。模糊反馈在前几轮后常常出现平台期或减少正确性，而有针对性的提示能够可靠地改善指定质量轴。同时观察到了一致的领域模式：思想创造在语义上移动更多，代码输出大小增长但语义变化少，数学初始固定但可通过后期详细迭代突破。

Conclusion: 该框架和指标使得迭代过程可以被量化和在不同模型之间进行比较，为定制化导航策略、停止时机或切换策略提供了重要信号。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are now used in multi-turn workflows, but we
still lack a clear way to measure when iteration helps and when it hurts. We
present an evaluation framework for iterative refinement that spans ideation,
code, and math. Our protocol runs controlled 12-turn conversations per task,
utilizing a variety of prompts ranging from vague ``improve it'' feedback to
targeted steering, and logs per-turn outputs. We score outcomes with
domain-appropriate checks (unit tests for code; answer-equivalence plus
reasoning-soundness for math; originality and feasibility for ideation) and
track turn-level behavior with three families of metrics: semantic movement
across turns, turn-to-turn change, and output size growth. Across models and
tasks, gains are domain-dependent: they arrive early in ideas and code, but in
math late turns matter when guided by elaboration. After the first few turns,
vague feedback often plateaus or reverses correctness, while targeted prompts
reliably shift the intended quality axis (novelty vs. feasibility in ideation;
speed vs. readability in code; in math, elaboration outperforms exploration and
drives late-turn gains). We also observe consistent domain patterns: ideation
moves more in meaning across turns, code tends to grow in size with little
semantic change, and math starts fixed but can break that path with late,
elaborative iteration.Together, the framework and metrics make iteration
measurable and comparable across models, and signal when to steer, stop, or
switch strategies.

TL;DR: RAFFLES是一个用于评估长时程多组件LLM智能体系统的迭代式评估架构，通过推理和迭代精化来识别系统故障点和原因，在故障检测准确率上显著超越现有基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM智能体系统的评估方法存在局限，主要关注单一指标或端到端结果，难以识别长时程多组件系统中复杂的故障点和原因。需要能够推理、探测、迭代和理解系统复杂逻辑的评估框架。

Method: RAFFLES采用迭代式多组件流水线架构，包含一个中央Judge系统性地调查故障，以及一组专门的Evaluators来评估系统组件质量和Judge自身的推理质量，建立假设历史。

Result: 在Who&When数据集上，RAFFLES在算法生成数据集上达到43%以上的agent-step故障对准确率（相比之前最佳16.6%大幅提升），在手工制作数据集上超过20%（超越之前最佳8.8%）。

Conclusion: RAFFLES代表了向自动化故障检测迈出的关键一步，能够替代劳动密集型的人工审查，为自主系统的故障诊断提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: We have reached a critical roadblock in the development and enhancement of
long-horizon, multi-component LLM agentic systems: it is incredibly tricky to
identify where these systems break down and why. Evaluation capabilities that
currently exist today (e.g., single pass LLM-as-a-judge) are limited in that
they often focus on individual metrics or capabilities, end-to-end outcomes,
and are narrowly grounded on the preferences of humans. We argue that to match
the agentic capabilities, evaluation frameworks must also be able to reason,
probe, iterate, and understand the complex logic passing through these systems
over long horizons. In this paper, we present RAFFLES - an evaluation
architecture that incorporates reasoning and iterative refinement.
Specifically, RAFFLES operates as an iterative, multi-component pipeline, using
a central Judge to systematically investigate faults and a set of specialized
Evaluators to assess not only the system's components but also the quality of
the reasoning by the Judge itself, thereby building a history of hypotheses. We
tested RAFFLES against several baselines on the Who&When dataset, a benchmark
designed to diagnose the "who" (agent) and "when" (step) of a system's failure.
RAFFLES outperforms these baselines, achieving an agent-step fault pair
accuracy of over 43% on the Algorithmically-Generated dataset (a substantial
increase from the previously published best of 16.6%) and over 20% on the
Hand-Crafted dataset (surpassing the previously published best of 8.8%). These
results demonstrate a key step towards introducing automated fault detection
for autonomous systems over labor-intensive manual human review.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估测试时扩展技术在知识密集任务中的效果，特别是关注事实准确性和幻觉率

Method: 使用12个推理模型在2个知识密集测试集上进行综合评估，分析扩展推理对幻觉行为的影响

Result: 增加测试时计算并不稳定提高准确性，反而在许多情况下导致更多幻觉；幻觉减少多因为模型选择放弃回答，而非收回过程改善

Conclusion: 虽然存在限制，但启用思考仍比不思考更有益；扩展推理可能引发确认偏见，导致过信任幻觉

Abstract: Test-time scaling increases inference-time computation by allowing models to
generate long reasoning chains, and has shown strong performance across many
domains. However, in this work, we show that this approach is not yet effective
for knowledge-intensive tasks, where high factual accuracy and low
hallucination rates are essential. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of
test-time scaling using 12 reasoning models on two knowledge-intensive
benchmarks. Our results reveal that increasing test-time computation does not
consistently improve accuracy and, in many cases, it even leads to more
hallucinations. We then analyze how extended reasoning affects hallucination
behavior. We find that reduced hallucinations often result from the model
choosing to abstain after thinking more, rather than from improved factual
recall. Conversely, for some models, longer reasoning encourages attempts on
previously unanswered questions, many of which result in hallucinations. Case
studies show that extended reasoning can induce confirmation bias, leading to
overconfident hallucinations. Despite these limitations, we observe that
compared to non-thinking, enabling thinking remains beneficial. Code and data

Motivation: 传统研究论文需要读者投入大量精力理解代码和方法，阻碍了知识的传播和重用。Paper2Agent旨在将被动的研究成果转化为主动系统，加速下游应用和发现。

Method: 使用多代理系统分析论文和关联代码库，构建Model Context Protocol (MCP)服务器，通过迭代生成和运行测试来优化MCP。生成的MCP可以与聊天代理连接，通过自然语言执行复杂科学查询。

Conclusion: Paper2Agent将静态论文转化为动态交互式AI代理，为知识传播和AI协科学生态系统奠定了新范式。

Abstract: We introduce Paper2Agent, an automated framework that converts research
papers into AI agents. Paper2Agent transforms research output from passive
artifacts into active systems that can accelerate downstream use, adoption, and
discovery. Conventional research papers require readers to invest substantial
effort to understand and adapt a paper's code, data, and methods to their own
work, creating barriers to dissemination and reuse. Paper2Agent addresses this
challenge by automatically converting a paper into an AI agent that acts as a
knowledgeable research assistant. It systematically analyzes the paper and the
associated codebase using multiple agents to construct a Model Context Protocol
(MCP) server, then iteratively generates and runs tests to refine and robustify
the resulting MCP. These paper MCPs can then be flexibly connected to a chat
agent (e.g. Claude Code) to carry out complex scientific queries through
natural language while invoking tools and workflows from the original paper. We
demonstrate Paper2Agent's effectiveness in creating reliable and capable paper
agents through in-depth case studies. Paper2Agent created an agent that
leverages AlphaGenome to interpret genomic variants and agents based on ScanPy
and TISSUE to carry out single-cell and spatial transcriptomics analyses. We
validate that these paper agents can reproduce the original paper's results and
can correctly carry out novel user queries. By turning static papers into
dynamic, interactive AI agents, Paper2Agent introduces a new paradigm for
knowledge dissemination and a foundation for the collaborative ecosystem of AI
co-scientists.

Motivation: 解决现有模型在对齐人类偏好时的两大挑战：(1)多步去噪计算费用高，限制优化步数；(2)需要连续离线调整奖励模型来达到目标美学质量

Method: 1. Direct-Align方法：预定义噪声前置，通过插值从任意时间步恢复原图像，避免后期时间步过度优化 2. SRPO方法：将奖励形式化为文本条件信号，通过正负提示扩充进行在线奖励调整

Conclusion: 该研究提出的Direct-Align和SRPO方法有效解决了现有模型在对齐人类偏好时的计算效率和奖励调整问题，显著提升了生成图像的质量

Abstract: Recent studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of directly aligning
diffusion models with human preferences using differentiable reward. However,
they exhibit two primary challenges: (1) they rely on multistep denoising with
gradient computation for reward scoring, which is computationally expensive,
thus restricting optimization to only a few diffusion steps; (2) they often
need continuous offline adaptation of reward models in order to achieve desired
aesthetic quality, such as photorealism or precise lighting effects. To address
the limitation of multistep denoising, we propose Direct-Align, a method that
predefines a noise prior to effectively recover original images from any time
steps via interpolation, leveraging the equation that diffusion states are
interpolations between noise and target images, which effectively avoids
over-optimization in late timesteps. Furthermore, we introduce Semantic
Relative Preference Optimization (SRPO), in which rewards are formulated as
text-conditioned signals. This approach enables online adjustment of rewards in
response to positive and negative prompt augmentation, thereby reducing the
reliance on offline reward fine-tuning. By fine-tuning the FLUX.1.dev model
with optimized denoising and online reward adjustment, we improve its
human-evaluated realism and aesthetic quality by over 3x.

TL;DR: 这篇论文分析了2024美国总统大选期间特朗普和哈里斯在TikTok上的竞选内容，采用表达式模型和工具性模型框架，发现双方更多重视身份讨论而非政策问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究TikTok等短视频平台在竞选通信中的新角色，以及各竞选团队如何适应该平台的短视频格式和算法驱动的内容特性。

Method: 结合两个数据集：特朗普和哈里斯竞选团队在2024年7-11月在TikTok上的发布内容，以及2022年对约1000名受访者的两波调查数据。

Result: 特朗普更多攻击哈里斯并强调共和党身份和问题，哈里斯则更多强调民主党身份和价值观。虽然问题预测党派身份，但双方讨论身份的次数（34%）超过问题（25%），大部分帖子（55%）两者都没有提及。

Conclusion: 在TikTok等短视频平台上，竞选内容更偏向于身份讨论而非政策问题，这反映了表达式模型在现代竞选通信中的重要性。

Abstract: Social media platforms are increasingly central to campaign communication,
with both paid (advertising) and earned (organic) posts used for fundraising,
mobilization, and persuasion. TikTok, and other short-form video platforms,
with its short-video format and content-driven algorithms, demand unique
content. We examine the final six months before the 2024 US Presidential
Election to understand how major campaigns used TikTok. We frame our analysis
around two political science theories. The first is the expressive (identity)
model, where voters are motivated by their group memberships and candidates
appeal to those identities. Alternatively, the instrumental (issues) model
argues voters align with politicians advocating their key issues. We also
examine how often candidates attacked opponents, reflecting literature showing
attacks are common in politics. We combine two datasets: posts from the Harris
and Trump campaigns on TikTok (July-November 2024) and a two-wave 2022 survey
of around 1,000 respondents. Results show Trump more often disparaged Harris
and emphasized identities and issues distinguishing Republicans, while Harris
more often highlighted Democratic identities and valued issues. Although issues
predict party ID, both candidates referenced identities more (34 percent of
posts) than issues (25 percent), with most posts mentioning neither (55
percent).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然TOEFL iBT引入了学术讨论任务来评估学术交际能力，但对于中国学生等多元文化群体的效度和公平性研究仍然有限，需要填补这一研究空白。

Method: 采用经典测验理论(CTT)方法，对中国大学生的TOEFL学术讨论任务进行心理测量特性分析，包括与CET-6写作和翻译子分数的相关性分析、专家对构忻效度的评估等。

Result: 发现学术讨论任务与CET-6写作和翻译子分数存在强相关关系，专家对构忻效度和评分标准的适度认同度高，性别在效度指标上的差异微小，证明该任务对中国考生具有良好效度且无性别歧视。

Conclusion: 学术讨论任务是一种有效的测量工具，但需要进一步精炼评分标准的文化敏感性，并保留CET-6写作子分数以便预测用途，以更好满足多样化考生群体的需求，推动高利益语言测试的公平性和效度研究。

Abstract: The TOEFL iBT has introduced the Academic Discussion Task (ADT) to assess
test-takers' ability to engage in academic discourse, reflecting the growing
emphasis on interactive communication skills in higher education. However,
research on the ADT's validity and fairness particularly for culturally and
linguistically diverse groups, such as Chinese students, remains limited. This
study addresses this gap by employing Classical Test Theory (CTT) to evaluate
the psychometric properties of the ADT among Chinese university students. This
study finds a robust correlation between the ADT and the CET-6 writing and
translation subscores. In addition, there is a high level of expert agreement
regarding the construct validity evidence and the appropriateness of the
scoring rubric. Furthermore, the results indicate that gender differences in
validity indices are minimal. Taken together, these results suggest that the
ADT is a valid measure for Chinese test-takers without gender discrimination.
However, it is recommended that the cultural sensitivity of the scoring rubric
be further refined and that the CET-6 subscores for writing be retained for
predictive purposes, in order to better accommodate the needs of diverse
test-taker populations. By addressing these issues, this study contributes to
the broader discourse on fairness and validity in high-stakes language
assessments.

Abstract: This paper presents a unique driving dataset collected in Nigeria via mobile
phone sensors to support a machine learning model for detecting
alcohol-influenced driving behaviours, with the long-term aim of integrating
this model into a mobile application that encourages safer driving behaviours.
Driving under the influence of alcohol is a major public safety concern,
particularly in low-income countries like Nigeria, where traditional
enforcement mechanisms may be limited. The proposed model leverages smartphone
sensors such as accelerometers, gyroscopes, and GPS to provide a non-invasive,
continuous solution for detecting impaired driving patterns in real time. This
study adapts existing data processing and pattern matching methodologies to
label real-world driving data collected from Nigerian drivers, which are then
used to train the model. A decision tree classifier is developed to detect
alcohol influence, based on behavioural and temporal features, achieving a
recall of 100%, a precision of 60%, and an F1 score of 75%. The model's overall
accuracy was 90.91%, ensuring that no alcohol influenced trips were missed. Key
predictive features included speed variability, course deviation, and time of
day, which align with established patterns of alcohol consumption. This study
contributes to the field by demonstrating how machine learning can be applied
in low-resource environments to improve road safety. The findings suggest that
the model can significantly enhance the detection and prevention of risky
driving behaviours, with the potential for future integration into mobile
applications to provide real-time feedback and encourage safer driving
practices. This scalable and accessible solution offers a new approach to
addressing road safety challenges in regions where traditional interventions
are inadequate.

TL;DR: 本文分析了美国AI监管可能面临的三大法律挑战：第一修正案、行政法和第十四修正案，为立法者提供规避法律风险的建议


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI技术快速发展，监管AI开发可能对公共安全至关重要，但监管措施可能面临法律挑战而无效，需要提前考虑这些风险

Method: 研究分析美国宪法第一修正案、行政法和第十四修正案的相关判例，探讨这些法律原则如何适用于AI监管，识别可能出现的法律挑战

Result: 识别了AI监管可能面临的三大类法律风险，分析了现有判例的适用性，提出了立法者可以预先应对这些挑战的策略

Conclusion: 有效的AI监管是可能的，但需要通过谨慎的实施来避免法律挑战，立法者需要提前考虑这些法律风险并采取相应措施

Abstract: As AI advances, governing its development may become paramount to public
safety. Lawmakers may seek to restrict the development and release of AI models
or of AI research itself. These governance actions could trigger legal
challenges that invalidate the actions, so lawmakers should consider these
challenges ahead of time. We investigate three classes of potential litigation
risk for AI regulation in the U.S.: the First Amendment, administrative law,
and the Fourteenth Amendment. We discuss existing precedent that is likely to
apply to AI, which legal challenges are likely to arise, and how lawmakers
might preemptively address them. Effective AI regulation is possible, but it
requires careful implementation to avoid these legal challenges.

TL;DR: 新西兰研究人员开发了一款AI驱动的住宅能效决策支持工具，通过集成数据分析、异常检测和情景模拟，为房主提供个性化节能改造建议。专家评估显示工具具有高可用性和实用价值。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 新西兰住宅质量差、隔热不足和供暖效率低导致能源困难普遍存在。虽然已有政策改革，但许多改造不完整，数据有限，房主决策支持分散，需要AI工具来弥合政策与实操之间的差距。

Method: 使用Python和Streamlit开发原型工具，集成数据摄取、异常检测、基线建模和情景模拟（如LED改造、隔热升级）功能。通过15位领域专家的半结构化访谈进行测试评估。

Result: 工具表现出强可用性（平均4.3分）和高价值的情景输出（平均4.5分）。专家认为该工具能有效补充补贴计划和监管框架，将国家政策转化为个性化家庭级指导。

Conclusion: 该AI工具展示了减少能源困难、改善健康结果和支持气候目标的潜力。未来应关注碳指标、电价建模、国家数据集集成和长期试验以评估实际应用效果。

Abstract: Residential buildings contribute significantly to energy use, health
outcomes, and carbon emissions. In New Zealand, housing quality has
historically been poor, with inadequate insulation and inefficient heating
contributing to widespread energy hardship. Recent reforms, including the
Warmer Kiwi Homes program, Healthy Homes Standards, and H1 Building Code
upgrades, have delivered health and comfort improvements, yet challenges
persist. Many retrofits remain partial, data on household performance are
limited, and decision-making support for homeowners is fragmented. This study
presents the design and evaluation of an AI-powered decision-support tool for
residential energy efficiency in New Zealand. The prototype, developed using
Python and Streamlit, integrates data ingestion, anomaly detection, baseline
modeling, and scenario simulation (e.g., LED retrofits, insulation upgrades)
into a modular dashboard. Fifteen domain experts, including building
scientists, consultants, and policy practitioners, tested the tool through
semi-structured interviews. Results show strong usability (M = 4.3), high value
of scenario outputs (M = 4.5), and positive perceptions of its potential to
complement subsidy programs and regulatory frameworks. The tool demonstrates
how AI can translate national policies into personalized, household-level
guidance, bridging the gap between funding, standards, and practical
decision-making. Its significance lies in offering a replicable framework for
reducing energy hardship, improving health outcomes, and supporting climate
goals. Future development should focus on carbon metrics, tariff modeling,
integration with national datasets, and longitudinal trials to assess
real-world adoption.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于基苏姆中央子县复杂的社会政治环境，需要包容性和上下文相应的项目监测策略，以确保捐资项目的有效性

Method: 采用聚合并行设计，根据Yamanes样本公式选取364名受访者，来自Obunga和Nyalenda非正式定居点的27个捐助项目，使用意向性和层级随机抽样方法

Result: 研究发现项目中存在常规的股东交互机会（x=4.05），股东对组织/项目发展做出了贡献（x=3.79），但股东观点并未被认真结合到程序中（x=2.06）

Conclusion: 股东参与M&E对捐资项目表现有积极影响，建议项目管理者加强股东参与以提升项目所有权和可持续性

Abstract: Stakeholder engagement and participatory approaches influence the
effectiveness of donor-funded projects. Participatory Monitoring and Evaluation
(PM&E) methodologies ensure that local communities play an active role in
decision-making, leading to more sustainable outcomes. Given the complex
socio-political landscape of Kisumu Central Sub-County, there is a critical
need for inclusive and context-responsive project monitoring strategies.
Initiatives that have integrated local leaders, youth groups, and women-led
organizations into their M&E processes tend to achieve stronger community
buy-in, improved continuity, and more impactful outcomes. The current study
explored the influence of stakeholder involvement in M&E on the performance of
donor-funded projects in informal settlements in Kisumu Central Sub-County,
Kenya. The study was guided by Stakeholder Engagement Theory. The study used a
Convergent Parallel design with a sample size of 364 respondents computed using
Yamanes' Sampling formula, drawn from 27 donor-funded projects in Obunga and
Nyalenda informal Settlements. Purposive sampling was used for project
managers, project M&E staff, and community members served, while community
members were selected using stratified random sampling. The study findings
revealed that there were regular opportunities for stakeholder interaction in
the projects (x =4.05, SD 1.08), stakeholders contributed to the development of
the organization/project (x= 3.79, SD=.940), although stakeholders'
perspectives and opinions were not diligently incorporated into programming
(x=2.06, SD=.879) as anticipated. The study, therefore, concluded that
stakeholder involvement in M&E influenced the performance of donor-funded
projects. The study recommended that the project managers in donor-funded
projects need to enhance stakeholder involvement for project ownership and
sustainability.

Abstract: This systematic literature review analyzes the current state of compliance
with Regulation (EU) 2024/1689 in autonomous robotic systems, focusing on
cybersecurity frameworks and methodologies. Using the PRISMA protocol, 22
studies were selected from 243 initial records across IEEE Xplore, ACM DL,
Scopus, and Web of Science. Findings reveal partial regulatory alignment: while
progress has been made in risk management and encrypted communications,
significant gaps persist in explainability modules, real-time human oversight,
and knowledge base traceability. Only 40% of reviewed solutions explicitly
address transparency requirements, and 30% implement failure intervention
mechanisms. The study concludes that modular approaches integrating risk,
supervision, and continuous auditing are essential to meet the AI Act mandates
in autonomous robotics.

Motivation: 随着数以百万计的用户通过聊天机器人与大语言模型交互，AI公司竞相获取高质量训练数据。需要研究这些公司如何使用用户聊天数据进行模型训练的隐私实践。

Method: 采用定性编码方法，基于加州消费者隐私法开发了一个新的编码框架，并应用于6家公司的相关隐私政策进行分析对比。

Result: 所有6家公司都默认使用用户聊天数据训练模型，部分公司永久保存数据。四家包括儿童聊天数据在内。隐私政策缺乏关键信息，包括收集敏感信息和上传文件。

Conclusion: 需要提高透明度和负责任制，建议政策制定者和开发者采取措施解决聊天机器人带来的数据隐私挑战。

Abstract: Hundreds of millions of people now regularly interact with large language
models via chatbots. Model developers are eager to acquire new sources of
high-quality training data as they race to improve model capabilities and win
market share. This paper analyzes the privacy policies of six U.S. frontier AI
developers to understand how they use their users' chats to train models.
Drawing primarily on the California Consumer Privacy Act, we develop a novel
qualitative coding schema that we apply to each developer's relevant privacy
policies to compare data collection and use practices across the six companies.
We find that all six developers appear to employ their users' chat data to
train and improve their models by default, and that some retain this data
indefinitely. Developers may collect and train on personal information
disclosed in chats, including sensitive information such as biometric and
health data, as well as files uploaded by users. Four of the six companies we
examined appear to include children's chat data for model training, as well as
customer data from other products. On the whole, developers' privacy policies
often lack essential information about their practices, highlighting the need
for greater transparency and accountability. We address the implications of
users' lack of consent for the use of their chat data for model training, data
security issues arising from indefinite chat data retention, and training on
children's chat data. We conclude by providing recommendations to policymakers
and developers to address the data privacy challenges posed by LLM-powered
chatbots.

Motivation: 当前关于LLMs在生物伦理、科学和医学写作中的作者身份存在争议，特别是在大型研究团队中，有些资深作者可能不亲自撰写任何文字但仍被视为作者。

Method: 通过类比分析，将LLMs的使用与高级作者的角色进行比较，论证在特定条件下LLMs生成内容应被视为合法的作者贡献。

Result: 提出LLMs使用（在特定条件下）可以类比为一种高级作者身份的形式，使用LLMs生成完整研究论文草稿应被视为符合许多领域公认标准的合法作者身份。

Conclusion: 要么承认这种LLMs使用为合法作者身份，要么需要对当前的作者身份标准进行根本性修订。

Abstract: The use of large language models (LLMs) in bioethical, scientific, and
medical writing remains controversial. While there is broad agreement in some
circles that LLMs cannot count as authors, there is no consensus about whether
and how humans using LLMs can count as authors. In many fields, authorship is
distributed among large teams of researchers, some of whom, including
paradigmatic senior authors who guide and determine the scope of a project and
ultimately vouch for its integrity, may not write a single word. In this paper,
we argue that LLM use (under specific conditions) is analogous to a form of
senior authorship. On this view, the use of LLMs, even to generate complete
drafts of research papers, can be considered a legitimate form of authorship
according to the accepted criteria in many fields. We conclude that either such
use should be recognized as legitimate, or current criteria for authorship
require fundamental revision. AI use declaration: GPT-5 was used to help format

Motivation: 教育知识图谱的自动构建对于领域知识建模至关重要，但目前缺乏可扩展且可靠的方法

Method: 从单个页面/幻灯片生成幻灯片级EduKG，然后合并形成完整的学习材料EduKG，并对多个管道组件进行针对性优化

Result: 优化后的管道在准确率上提高了17.5%，处理效率提升了10倍

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一个整体、可扩展的端到端EduKG自动构建管道，适用于多样化教育场景，支持改进学习内容的语义表示

Abstract: The automatic construction of Educational Knowledge Graphs (EduKGs) is
essential for domain knowledge modeling by extracting meaningful
representations from learning materials. Despite growing interest, identifying
a scalable and reliable approach for automatic EduKG generation remains a
challenge. In an attempt to develop a unified and robust pipeline for automatic
EduKG construction, in this study we propose a pipeline for automatic EduKG
construction from PDF learning materials. The process begins with generating
slide-level EduKGs from individual pages/slides, which are then merged to form
a comprehensive EduKG representing the entire learning material. We evaluate
the accuracy of the EduKG generated from the proposed pipeline in our MOOC
platform, CourseMapper. The observed accuracy, while indicative of partial
success, is relatively low particularly in the educational context, where the
reliability of knowledge representations is critical for supporting meaningful
learning. To address this, we introduce targeted optimizations across multiple
pipeline components. The optimized pipeline achieves a 17.5% improvement in
accuracy and a tenfold increase in processing efficiency. Our approach offers a
holistic, scalable and end-to-end pipeline for automatic EduKG construction,
adaptable to diverse educational contexts, and supports improved semantic
representation of learning content.

Motivation: MOOC平台CourseMapper中的教育知识图缺乏显式的调先关系链接，手工标注耗时且不一致

Method: 定义10个准则（文档、维基超链接、图谱和文本特征），通过投票算法结合这些特征来抓取调先关系

Result: 在标准数据集上达到比现有方法更高的精确度，同时保持了可扩展性和适应性

Conclusion: 该方法为CourseMapper提供了可靠的序列感知学习支持，解决了调先关系缺失问题

Abstract: Educational Knowledge Graphs (EduKGs) organize various learning entities and
their relationships to support structured and adaptive learning. Prerequisite
relationships (PRs) are critical in EduKGs for defining the logical order in
which concepts should be learned. However, the current EduKG in the MOOC
platform CourseMapper lacks explicit PR links, and manually annotating them is
time-consuming and inconsistent. To address this, we propose an unsupervised
method for automatically inferring concept PRs without relying on labeled data.
We define ten criteria based on document-based, Wikipedia hyperlink-based,
graph-based, and text-based features, and combine them using a voting algorithm
to robustly capture PRs in educational content. Experiments on benchmark
datasets show that our approach achieves higher precision than existing methods
while maintaining scalability and adaptability, thus providing reliable support
for sequence-aware learning in CourseMapper.

TL;DR: 该研究开发了一个综合风险评分系统，用于评估尼日利亚各州对COVID-19的脆弱性，发现高密度城市地区风险最高，为资源分配提供决策支持。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: COVID-19大流行对尼日利亚公共卫生系统构成重大挑战，需要识别高风险地区以优化资源配置。

Method: 构建综合风险评分系统，整合人口密度(0.2)、贫困率(0.4)、医疗可及性(0.3)和年龄风险(0.1)四个因素，并通过GIS地图分析进行热点识别。

Result: 拉各斯等高密度城市地区风险评分最高(673.47)，占全国病例35.4%，远高于全国平均水平(28.16)。

Conclusion: 该风险评分可作为政策制定者的优先排序工具，用于分配检测、疫苗和医疗资源，并可扩展到其他传染病应对。

Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic has presented significant challenges in Nigeria's
public health systems since the first case reported on February 27, 2020. This
study investigates key factors that contribute to state vulnerability,
quantifying them through a composite risk score integrating population density
(weight 0.2), poverty (0.4), access to healthcare (0.3), and age risk (0.1),
adjusted by normalized case rates per 100,000. States were categorized into
low-, medium-, and high-density areas to analyze trends and identify hotspots
using geographic information system (GIS) mapping. The findings reveal that
high-density urban areas, such as Lagos, accounting for 35.4% of national
cases, had the highest risk scores (Lagos: 673.47 vs. national average: 28.16).
These results align with global and local studies on the spatial variability of
COVID-19 in Nigeria, including international frameworks such as the CDC Social
Vulnerability Index. Google Trends data highlight variations in public health
awareness, serving as a supplementary analysis to contextualize vulnerability.
The risk score provides a prioritization tool for policymakers to allocate
testing, vaccines, and healthcare resources to high-risk areas, though data
gaps and rural underreporting call for further research. This framework can
extend to other infectious diseases, offering lessons for future pandemics in
resource-limited settings.

Motivation: 因为现有标准化测量方法很少考虑海洋合作组织国家的特殊驱动因素、治理模式和文化细节，需要一个特定于该地区公共部门的AI采用评估工具。

Method: 采用理论驱动和数据驱动相结合的方法：深度文献分析和6个国家AI战略分析，对203名中高级政府员工进行调查，并使用K-Means聚类、主成分分析和偏最小二乘结构方程模型等高级统计技术。

Result: 研究发现健全的基础设施和清晰的政策指令对AI实施成功有最强影响，在早期采用阶段超过组织准备度的重要性。结合模型能解释70%的AI成果变异，说明资源丰富环境和顶层政策指令可以推动快速但不均衡的技术采用。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly transforming public-sector processes
worldwide, yet standardized measures rarely address the unique drivers,
governance models, and cultural nuances of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC)
countries. This study employs a theory-driven foundation derived from an
in-depth analysis of literature review and six National AI Strategies (NASs),
coupled with a data-driven approach that utilizes a survey of 203 mid- and
senior-level government employees and advanced statistical techniques (K-Means
clustering, Principal Component Analysis, and Partial Least Squares Structural
Equation Modeling). By combining policy insights with empirical evidence, the
research develops and validates a novel AI Adoption Index specifically tailored
to the GCC public sector. Findings indicate that robust infrastructure and
clear policy mandates exert the strongest influence on successful AI
implementations, overshadowing organizational readiness in early adoption
stages. The combined model explains 70% of the variance in AI outcomes,
suggesting that resource-rich environments and top-down policy directives can
drive rapid but uneven technology uptake. By consolidating key dimensions
(Infrastructure & Resources, Organizational Readiness, and Policy & Regulatory
Environment) into a single composite index, this study provides a holistic yet
context-sensitive tool for benchmarking AI maturity. The index offers
actionable guidance for policymakers seeking to harmonize large-scale
deployments with ethical and regulatory standards. Beyond advancing academic
discourse, these insights inform more strategic allocation of resources,
cross-country cooperation, and capacity-building initiatives, thereby
supporting sustained AI-driven transformation in the GCC region and beyond.

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种在有限计算资源、数据和模型访问权限下，帮助原告确定是否存在较少歧视替代方案(LDA)的方法，通过推导损失-公平性帕累托前沿的闭式上界，使原告无需训练大型模型即可评估歧视性替代方案的存在性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 反歧视法中的"较少歧视替代方案"要求给原告带来了重大障碍，因为原告需要训练性能相当但歧视性更小的模型，这需要大量资源和专业知识，而开发者通常将模型和训练数据作为商业秘密保护，使得从零开始复制类似模型变得困难。

Method: 提出了一个新颖的闭式上界来描述损失-公平性帕累托前沿，原告可以使用少量训练/测试数据的子样本，通过训练仅7个小型模型来拟合特定上下文的帕累托前沿，然后外推到被质疑的大型模型。

Result: 该方法在模拟中进行了压力测试，发现即使理论条件不完全满足时，缩放定律仍然成立，证明了该方法的有效性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 这项工作为资源有限的原告提供了一种实用的工具，可以在不需要训练大型模型的情况下确定较少歧视替代方案的存在性，有助于促进AI审计和反歧视法的实施。

Abstract: AI audits play a critical role in AI accountability and safety. One branch of
the law for which AI audits are particularly salient is anti-discrimination
law. Several areas of anti-discrimination law implicate the "less
discriminatory alternative" (LDA) requirement, in which a protocol (e.g.,
model) is defensible if no less discriminatory protocol that achieves
comparable performance can be found with a reasonable amount of effort.
Notably, the burden of proving an LDA exists typically falls on the claimant
(the party alleging discrimination). This creates a significant hurdle in AI
cases, as the claimant would seemingly need to train a less discriminatory yet
high-performing model, a task requiring resources and expertise beyond most
litigants. Moreover, developers often shield information about and access to
their model and training data as trade secrets, making it difficult to
reproduce a similar model from scratch.
  In this work, we present a procedure enabling claimants to determine if an
LDA exists, even when they have limited compute, data, information, and model
access. We focus on the setting in which fairness is given by demographic
parity and performance by binary cross-entropy loss. As our main result, we
provide a novel closed-form upper bound for the loss-fairness Pareto frontier
(PF). We show how the claimant can use it to fit a PF in the "low-resource
regime," then extrapolate the PF that applies to the (large) model being
contested, all without training a single large model. The expression thus
serves as a scaling law for loss-fairness PFs. To use this scaling law, the
claimant would require a small subsample of the train/test data. Then, the
claimant can fit the context-specific PF by training as few as 7 (small)
models. We stress test our main result in simulations, finding that our scaling
law holds even when the exact conditions of our theory do not.

Motivation: 调查TikTok对青少年账户有害内容限制机制的有效性，评估平台年龄分级内容审核的实际效果

Method: 收集7000+视频并分类，使用年龄特定的模拟账户进行被动和主动交互测试，评估LLM和VLM在有害内容检测中的表现

Result: 初步结果显示青少年和成人账户在有害内容接触方面差异极小，平台基于年龄的审核机制效果不佳

Conclusion: TikTok需要加强青少年安全保护措施，提高内容审核的透明度，并改进有害内容检测技术

Abstract: This paper investigates the effectiveness of TikTok's enforcement mechanisms
for limiting the exposure of harmful content to youth accounts. We collect over
7000 videos, classify them as harmful vs not-harmful, and then simulate
interactions using age-specific sockpuppet accounts through both passive and
active engagement strategies. We also evaluate the performance of large
language (LLMs) and vision-language models (VLMs) in detecting harmful content,
identifying key challenges in precision and scalability.
  Preliminary results show minimal differences in content exposure between
adult and youth accounts, raising concerns about the platform's age-based

*Denis Helic,Tiago Santos*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: ChatGPT的出现加速了Stack Overflow用户贡献的下降，但同时也提高了平台上问题和代码的长度及难度，表明用户转向该平台寻求更复杂问题的帮助。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究ChatGPT对Stack Overflow用户生成内容的转变影响，特别是在用户留存和贡献下降的背景下，分析AI工具对编程帮助寻求和协作知识创造的影响。

Method: 分析两年Stack Overflow数据，构建多个因果回归模型来估计ChatGPT对用户问题和代码示例长度及难度的影响。

Result: 确认用户贡献加速下降，但ChatGPT对问题和答案长度、代码长度以及问题难度有显著正向影响，表明平台上的问题质量提升。

Conclusion: ChatGPT提高了Stack Overflow上问题的门槛，用户更多转向众包平台寻求复杂和挑战性问题的帮助，为平台运营商提供了支持信息管理和用户留存的可操作见解。

Abstract: Millions of users visit Stack Overflow regularly to ask community for answers
to their programming questions. However, like many other platforms, Stack
Overflow consistently struggles with low user retention and declining levels of
user contributions to the platform. With the introduction of ChatGPT in
November 2022, these ongoing difficulties on Stack Overflow were further
magnified, as many users moved toward ChatGPT for programming help. In this
paper, we build upon recent research on this phenomenon by analyzing the
transformation of user-generated content on Stack Overflow during the
post-ChatGPT period. Specifically, we analyze two years of Stack Overflow data
and fit multiple causal regression models to estimate the effect of ChatGPT on
the length and difficulty of user questions and code examples. We confirm an
acceleration of decline in user contributions but find that ChatGPT had a
significant positive effect on question and answer length, code length, and
question difficulty on Stack Overflow across programming languages. Our results
suggest that ChatGPT has effectively raised the bar for questions on Stack
Overflow, as users increasingly turn to crowdsourced platforms for help with
more complex and challenging problems. With our work we contribute to the
ongoing discussion on the impact of tools such as ChatGPT on help-seeking in
programming and, more broadly, on collaborative knowledge creation. Our results
provide actionable insights for platform operators to support information
management and user retention in the aftermath of ChatGPT's launch.

### [346] [Operationalising AI Regulatory Sandboxes under the EU AI Act: The Triple Challenge of Capacity, Coordination and Attractiveness to Providers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05985)
*Deirdre Ahern*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 欧盟AI法案要求成员国建立国家AI监管沙盒来测试创新AI系统，但存在能力建设、设计差异、统一解释风险等问题，需要欧盟委员会制定统一指导规则。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究欧盟AI法案中关于国家AI监管沙盒的要求，分析其在促进创新和合规方面的作用，识别成员国面临的挑战和风险。

Method: 通过分析欧盟AI法案条款，考察成员国在建立AI监管沙盒方面的早期实践，识别能力建设、设计差异、统一解释等方面的挑战。

Result: 发现成员国在建立AI监管沙盒时面临能力建设和设计挑战，不同国家沙盒的差异做法可能危及AI法案的统一解释和实践应用，导致创新者进行沙盒套利。

Conclusion: 欧盟委员会和AI委员会需要制定明确的规则和指导，确保国家AI监管沙盒采取协调一致的方法，同时需要解决沙盒对创新者的吸引力问题，包括保密性担忧、法律规则放松限制等问题。

Abstract: The EU AI Act provides a rulebook for all AI systems being put on the market
or into service in the European Union. This article investigates the
requirement under the AI Act that Member States establish national AI
regulatory sandboxes for testing and validation of innovative AI systems under
regulatory supervision to assist with fostering innovation and complying with
regulatory requirements. Against the backdrop of the EU objective that AI
regulatory sandboxes would both foster innovation and assist with compliance,
considerable challenges are identified for Member States around
capacity-building and design of regulatory sandboxes. While Member States are
early movers in laying the ground for national AI regulatory sandboxes, the
article contends that there is a risk that differing approaches being taken by
individual national sandboxes could jeopardise a uniform interpretation of the
AI Act and its application in practice. This could motivate innovators to play
sandbox arbitrage. The article therefore argues that the European Commission
and the AI Board need to act decisively in developing rules and guidance to
ensure a cohesive, coordinated approach in national AI regulatory sandboxes.
With sandbox participation being voluntary, the possibility that AI regulatory
sandboxes may prove unattractive to innovators on their compliance journey is
also explored. Confidentiality concerns, the inability to relax legal rules
during the sandbox, and the inability of sandboxes to deliver a presumption of
conformity with the AI Act are identified as pertinent concerns for innovators
contemplating applying to AI regulatory sandboxes as compared with other direct
compliance routes provided to them through application of harmonised standards
and conformity assessment procedures.

Abstract: This study examines the integration of digital tools in project-based
learning within a Biomedical Engineering course to enhance collaboration,
transparency, and assessment fairness. Building on prior pilot experiences, we
implemented a structured learning environment that combined experiment
tracking, real-time collaboration, and peer-assessment practices. The
intervention was deployed across two consecutive academic years, involving
master's-level students in Biomedical Image Processing. Data were collected
through project outcomes, peer-assessment rubrics, and student surveys. Results
show that the integration of digital platforms supported accountability,
improved the quality of collaborative work, and fostered greater equity in the
evaluation process. Students highlighted increased engagement, enhanced
teamwork, and clearer criteria for performance assessment. Faculty reported
more efficient monitoring of progress and improved feedback practices. Despite
challenges such as technical adoption and the need for instructor guidance, the
study demonstrates the potential of structured tool integration to support
active and transparent learning environments. Findings contribute to the
broader discourse on digital pedagogy, offering a replicable model for higher
education contexts in science and technology.

TL;DR: DAO虽被框架为无许可进入和平等主义，但实际上存在金融特权、非正式门槛、可见性偏见等文化社会障碍，影响有意义的包容性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索DAO中被忽视的文化和社会动态，揭示参与和权力的真实情况，调查虽然DAO被框架为无许可进入和平等主义，但实际上存在的结构性盲点和包容性障碍。

Method: 采用定性访谈和民族志观察方法，通过对贡献者实际经验的研究来揭示DAO内部的文化社会动态。

Result: 发现金融特权、非正式门槛、可见性偏见和入职结构等因素造成了有意义包容的障碍，某些软权力和隐式规范实际上决定了人们在DAO中的地位。

Conclusion: 去中心化不仅仅是协议层面的特性，而是一个需要意图培育信任、归属感和认知多元性的持续社会过程，应强调文化反思和建设更包容、文化意识的去中心化系统。

Abstract: This report explores the often-overlooked cultural and social dynamics
shaping participation and power in DAOs. Drawing on qualitative interviews and
ethnographic observations, it shows how factors such as financial privilege,
informal gatekeeping, visibility bias, and onboarding structures create
barriers to meaningful inclusion. While DAOs are frequently framed as
permissionless and egalitarian, the lived experiences of contributors reveal a
more complex reality, one in which soft power and implicit norms determine
people's position within DAOs. Instead of offering solutionist prescriptions,
this report argues for a deeper cultural reflection within the DAO ecosystem.
It highlights that decentralisation is not solely a protocol-level feature, but
an ongoing social process that requires intentional cultivation of trust,
belonging, and epistemic plurality. With this report, we want to sharpen the
collective awareness of structural blind spots and call for building more
inclusive and culturally conscious decentralised systems.

Abstract: As artificial intelligence (AI) systems permeate critical sectors, the need
for professionals who can address ethical, legal and governance challenges has
become urgent. Current AI ethics education remains fragmented, often siloed by
discipline and disconnected from practice. This paper synthesizes literature
and regulatory developments to propose a modular, interdisciplinary curriculum
that integrates technical foundations with ethics, law and policy. We highlight
recurring operational failures in AI - bias, misspecified objectives,
generalization errors, misuse and governance breakdowns - and link them to
pedagogical strategies for teaching AI governance. Drawing on perspectives from
the EU, China and international frameworks, we outline a semester plan that
emphasizes integrated ethics, stakeholder engagement and experiential learning.
The curriculum aims to prepare students to diagnose risks, navigate regulation
and engage diverse stakeholders, fostering adaptive and ethically grounded
professionals for responsible AI governance.
