### [1] [CellPainTR: Generalizable Representation Learning for Cross-Dataset Cell Painting Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06986)
*Cedric Caruzzo,Jong Chul Ye*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CellPainTR是基于Transformer的架构，用于学习对批次效应鲁棒的细胞形态基础表征，无需微调即可在未见数据集上实现出色的泛化性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模生物发现需要整合海量异构数据集，但技术批次效应和缺乏通用模型是主要障碍

Method: 采用Transformer架构，设计源特定上下文标记，实现无需重新训练的有效分布外泛化

Result: 在JUMP数据集上优于ComBat和Harmony等现有方法，在未见Bray数据集上保持高性能

Conclusion: 这项工作为创建真正的基础模型迈出重要一步，实现了更可靠和可扩展的跨研究生物分析

Abstract: Large-scale biological discovery requires integrating massive, heterogeneous
datasets like those from the JUMP Cell Painting consortium, but technical batch
effects and a lack of generalizable models remain critical roadblocks. To
address this, we introduce CellPainTR, a Transformer-based architecture
designed to learn foundational representations of cellular morphology that are
robust to batch effects. Unlike traditional methods that require retraining on
new data, CellPainTR's design, featuring source-specific context tokens, allows
for effective out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization to entirely unseen
datasets without fine-tuning. We validate CellPainTR on the large-scale JUMP
dataset, where it outperforms established methods like ComBat and Harmony in
both batch integration and biological signal preservation. Critically, we
demonstrate its robustness through a challenging OOD task on the unseen Bray et
al. dataset, where it maintains high performance despite significant domain and
feature shifts. Our work represents a significant step towards creating truly
foundational models for image-based profiling, enabling more reliable and
scalable cross-study biological analysis.

### [2] [FusWay: Multimodal hybrid fusion approach. Application to Railway Defect Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06987)
*Alexey Zhukov,Jenny Benois-Pineau,Amira Youssef,Akka Zemmari,Mohamed Mosbah,Virginie Taillandier*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出基于YOLOv8n和Vision Transformer的多模态融合架构，结合图像和音频信息进行铁路缺陷检测，相比单模态方法精度提升0.2个点


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统单模态检测方法在铁路缺陷检测中存在过度检测问题，特别是当缺陷外观与正常结构元素相似时，需要多模态信息来提高检测精度

Method: 构建基于领域规则的多模态融合架构，使用YOLOv8n进行快速目标检测，结合Vision Transformer整合多个层级（7、16、19层）的特征图和合成音频表示，对两类缺陷（轨道断裂和表面缺陷）进行图像和音频融合

Result: 在真实铁路数据集上的实验表明，多模态融合相比纯视觉方法精度和整体准确率提升0.2个点，学生t检验证实了准确率差异的统计显著性

Conclusion: 多模态融合方法能有效提升铁路缺陷检测性能，结合视觉和音频信息可以克服单模态方法的局限性

Abstract: Multimodal fusion is a multimedia technique that has become popular in the
wide range of tasks where image information is accompanied by a signal/audio.
The latter may not convey highly semantic information, such as speech or music,
but some measures such as audio signal recorded by mics in the goal to detect
rail structure elements or defects. While classical detection approaches such
as You Only Look Once (YOLO) family detectors can be efficiently deployed for
defect detection on the image modality, the single modality approaches remain
limited. They yield an overdetection in case of the appearance similar to
normal structural elements. The paper proposes a new multimodal fusion
architecture built on the basis of domain rules with YOLO and Vision
transformer backbones. It integrates YOLOv8n for rapid object detection with a
Vision Transformer (ViT) to combine feature maps extracted from multiple layers
(7, 16, and 19) and synthesised audio representations for two defect classes:
rail Rupture and Surface defect. Fusion is performed between audio and image.
Experimental evaluation on a real-world railway dataset demonstrates that our
multimodal fusion improves precision and overall accuracy by 0.2 points
compared to the vision-only approach. Student's unpaired t-test also confirms
statistical significance of differences in the mean accuracy.

### [3] [Frustratingly Easy Feature Reconstruction for Out-of-Distribution Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06988)
*Yingsheng Wang,Shuo Lu,Jian Liang,Aihua Zheng,Ran He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需训练数据的后处理OOD检测方法ClaFR，通过分类器权重的正交分解获得类已知子空间，计算特征重构误差来实现OOD检测，在多个基准测试中达到领先性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于特征的后处理OOD检测方法通常需要访问训练数据，这在数据隐私保护场景下不适用。需要开发一种不依赖训练数据的有效OOD检测方法。

Method: ClaFR方法：1）对分类器权重进行正交分解提取类已知子空间；2）将原始数据特征映射到该子空间获得新表示；3）计算子空间内的特征重构误差作为OOD分数。

Result: 在多个OOD基准测试中取得了领先性能，且不需要访问训练数据。

Conclusion: ClaFR是一种简单有效的后处理OOD检测方法，通过子空间投影和特征重构误差计算，在不依赖训练数据的情况下实现了优异的检测性能。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection helps models identify data outside the
training categories, crucial for security applications. While feature-based
post-hoc methods address this by evaluating data differences in the feature
space without changing network parameters, they often require access to
training data, which may not be suitable for some data privacy scenarios. This
may not be suitable in scenarios where data privacy protection is a concern. In
this paper, we propose a simple yet effective post-hoc method, termed
Classifier-based Feature Reconstruction (ClaFR), from the perspective of
subspace projection. It first performs an orthogonal decomposition of the
classifier's weights to extract the class-known subspace, then maps the
original data features into this subspace to obtain new data representations.
Subsequently, the OOD score is determined by calculating the feature
reconstruction error of the data within the subspace. Compared to existing OOD
detection algorithms, our method does not require access to training data while
achieving leading performance on multiple OOD benchmarks. Our code is released
at https://github.com/Aie0923/ClaFR.

### [4] [DIET-CP: Lightweight and Data Efficient Self Supervised Continued Pretraining](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06990)
*Bryan Rodas,Natalie Montesino,Jakob Ambsdorf,David Klindt,Randall Balestriero*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DIET-CP是一种简单的持续预训练策略，能够在极小数据集（仅1000张图像）上有效调整基础模型以适应新领域，无需标签且超参数极少


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决专业领域中数据集规模小导致SSL方法不适用、超参数搜索不可行，以及预训练模型缺乏重要信息的问题

Method: 基于简单目标函数的持续预训练策略，无需标签，引入的超参数不超过监督微调，适用于多种数据模态和骨干网络

Result: 在仅使用1000张图像的情况下，显著提升了DINOv3等最先进模型的性能，且在不同数据模态和骨干网络中表现稳定

Conclusion: DIET-CP为小规模专业领域数据提供了一种简单有效的持续预训练解决方案，填补了基础模型适应新数据分布的空白

Abstract: Continued pretraining offers a promising solution for adapting foundation
models to a new target domain. However, in specialized domains, available
datasets are often very small, limiting the applicability of SSL methods
developed for large-scale pretraining and making hyperparameter search
infeasible. In addition, pretrained models are usually released as
backbone-weights only, lacking important information to continue pretraining.
We propose to bridge this gap with DIET-CP, a simple continued pretraining
strategy, where any strong foundation model can be steered towards the new data
distribution of interest. DIET-CP relies on a very simple objective, requires
no labels, and introduces no more hyperparameters than supervised finetuning.
It is stable across data modalities and backbone choices, while providing a
significant performance boost for state-of-the-art models such as DINOv3 using
only 1000 images.

### [5] [FedAPT: Federated Adversarial Prompt Tuning for Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06992)
*Kun Zhai,Siheng Chen,Xingjun Ma,Yu-Gang Jiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FedAPT是一种增强联邦提示调优对抗鲁棒性的新方法，通过类别感知提示生成器和跨层生成器共享策略来解决非IID设置下的类别信息差距问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的联邦提示调优方法在面对对抗攻击时容易导致下游任务错误分类，特别是在非独立同分布设置下存在客户端与全局模型之间的类别信息差距问题

Method: 提出类别感知提示生成器，利用全局标签嵌入作为引导生成视觉提示；采用跨层生成器共享策略增强不同模型层间的提示耦合

Result: 在多个图像分类数据集上的实验表明，FedAPT在提升对抗鲁棒性方面显著优于现有方法，并在跨域和跨数据集场景中展现出优异的泛化能力

Conclusion: FedAPT有效解决了联邦提示调优中的对抗鲁棒性问题，具有实际应用价值

Abstract: Federated Prompt Tuning (FPT) is an efficient method for cross-client
collaborative fine-tuning of large Vision-Language Models (VLMs). However,
models tuned using FPT are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, leading to
misclassification in downstream tasks. In this work, we introduce Federated
Adversarial Prompt Tuning (\textbf{FedAPT}), a novel method designed to enhance
the adversarial robustness of FPT. We identify a key issue in FedAPT under
non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) settings: a \textit{class
information gap} between clients and the global model. Clients rely solely on
limited local label information to generate adversarial samples for training,
while the global model must defend against adversarial attacks from global
labels. To address this issue, we propose a \textbf{class-aware prompt
generator} that generates visual prompts from text prompts. This generator is
guided by a \emph{Global Label Embedding} (serving as a ``beacon") which
encodes cross-client label information to create more globally-aligned visual
prompts. Additionally, we propose a \textbf{cross-layer generator sharing}
strategy to enhance prompt coupling across different layers of the model,
further boosting adversarial robustness. Extensive experiments on multiple
image classification datasets demonstrate the superiority of FedAPT in
improving adversarial robustness, outperforming existing methods by a large
margin. FedAPT also exhibits exceptional generalization in cross-domain and
cross-dataset scenarios, indicating its effectiveness in real-world
applications.

### [6] [Automated Evaluation of Gender Bias Across 13 Large Multimodal Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07050)
*Juan Manuel Contreras*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文介绍了Aymara图像公平性评估基准，用于评估AI生成图像中的社会偏见。研究发现大型多模态模型不仅复制还放大了职业性别刻板印象，存在显著的默认男性偏见，且不同模型的偏见程度差异很大。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究虽然识别了大型多模态模型中的性别偏见，但方法学限制阻碍了大规模、可比较的跨模型分析。需要填补这一研究空白，开发标准化评估工具。

Method: 使用75个程序生成的性别中性提示词，测试13个商业可用的大型多模态模型，生成刻板印象男性、女性和非刻板印象职业的人物图像，然后使用经过验证的LLM-as-a-judge系统对965张图像进行性别代表性评分。

Result: 研究发现：1）LMMs系统性放大职业性别刻板印象；2）模型存在强烈默认男性偏见；3）不同模型的偏见程度差异显著（46.7%-73.3%男性代表性）。表现最佳的模型接近性别平等。

Conclusion: 高度偏见并非不可避免的结果，而是设计选择的结果。需要标准化自动化评估工具来促进AI开发中的问责制和公平性。

Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) have revolutionized text-to-image generation,
but they risk perpetuating the harmful social biases in their training data.
Prior work has identified gender bias in these models, but methodological
limitations prevented large-scale, comparable, cross-model analysis. To address
this gap, we introduce the Aymara Image Fairness Evaluation, a benchmark for
assessing social bias in AI-generated images. We test 13 commercially available
LMMs using 75 procedurally-generated, gender-neutral prompts to generate people
in stereotypically-male, stereotypically-female, and non-stereotypical
professions. We then use a validated LLM-as-a-judge system to score the 965
resulting images for gender representation. Our results reveal (p < .001 for
all): 1) LMMs systematically not only reproduce but actually amplify
occupational gender stereotypes relative to real-world labor data, generating
men in 93.0% of images for male-stereotyped professions but only 22.5% for
female-stereotyped professions; 2) Models exhibit a strong default-male bias,
generating men in 68.3% of the time for non-stereotyped professions; and 3) The
extent of bias varies dramatically across models, with overall male
representation ranging from 46.7% to 73.3%. Notably, the top-performing model
de-amplified gender stereotypes and approached gender parity, achieving the
highest fairness scores. This variation suggests high bias is not an inevitable
outcome but a consequence of design choices. Our work provides the most
comprehensive cross-model benchmark of gender bias to date and underscores the
necessity of standardized, automated evaluation tools for promoting
accountability and fairness in AI development.

### [8] [VLMs-in-the-Wild: Bridging the Gap Between Academic Benchmarks and Enterprise Reality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06994)
*Srihari Bandraupalli,Anupam Purwar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ViLD框架填补了学术评估与企业部署需求之间的鸿沟，通过10个商业关键任务和创新的BlockWeaver算法，在真实企业数据上评估开源视觉语言模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基准测试主要依赖选择题和合成数据，无法捕捉真实企业应用的复杂性，如社交媒体内容分析。需要建立更贴近企业部署需求的评估框架。

Method: 提出ViLD框架，定义10个商业关键任务；开发BlockWeaver算法用于无序OCR输出比较；构建包含7500个样本的新基准数据集；结合语义匹配、传统指标和新方法评估模型输出。

Result: 在Qwen、MIMO和InternVL等开源VLM与专有基线的对比评估中，ViLD提供了首个基于行业实际需求的、任务驱动的VLM能力评估。

Conclusion: ViLD框架为企业环境中VLM的部署提供了可操作的见解，填补了学术评估与企业实际需求之间的重要空白。

Abstract: Open-source Vision-Language Models show immense promise for enterprise
applications, yet a critical disconnect exists between academic evaluation and
enterprise deployment requirements. Current benchmarks rely heavily on
multiple-choice questions and synthetic data, failing to capture the complexity
of real-world business applications like social media content analysis. This
paper introduces VLM-in-the-Wild (ViLD), a comprehensive framework to bridge
this gap by evaluating VLMs on operational enterprise requirements. We define
ten business-critical tasks: logo detection, OCR, object detection, human
presence and demographic analysis, human activity and appearance analysis,
scene detection, camera perspective and media quality assessment, dominant
colors, comprehensive description, and NSFW detection. To this framework, we
bring an innovative BlockWeaver Algorithm that solves the challenging problem
of comparing unordered, variably-grouped OCR outputs from VLMs without relying
on embeddings or LLMs, achieving remarkable speed and reliability. To
demonstrate efficacy of ViLD, we constructed a new benchmark dataset of 7,500
diverse samples, carefully stratified from a corpus of one million real-world
images and videos. ViLD provides actionable insights by combining semantic
matching (both embedding-based and LLM-as-a-judge approaches), traditional
metrics, and novel methods to measure the completeness and faithfulness of
descriptive outputs. By benchmarking leading open-source VLMs (Qwen, MIMO, and
InternVL) against a powerful proprietary baseline as per ViLD framework, we
provide one of the first industry-grounded, task-driven assessment of VLMs
capabilities, offering actionable insights for their deployment in enterprise
environments.

### [9] [The Protocol Genome A Self Supervised Learning Framework from DICOM Headers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06995)
*Jimmy Joseph*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Protocol Genome是一个自监督学习系统，通过分析DICOM头部信息来学习协议相关性，在外部验证中达到AUROC 0.901（基准为0.847）和ECE 0.036（基准为0.058），提高了跨模态和供应商的校准性和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床影像通过PACS/DICOM系统处理，扫描协议选择（扫描仪型号、序列、参数等）会影响对比度、噪声和伪影，这些潜在混杂因素阻碍了仅基于图像的网络在不同站点间的泛化能力。

Method: 将结构化DICOM头部作为标签，通过三种方式学习协议感知但临床鲁棒的图像表示：(1)协议-图像对比学习，(2)掩码协议预测，(3)协议-协议转换。使用126万项研究数据（7个医疗系统，31台扫描仪，3个供应商）。

Result: 在三个临床任务上表现优异：肺栓塞CT分诊（+0.046 AUROC）、脑胶质瘤MRI分级（+0.058 AUROC）、心胸比X光检测（+0.041 AUROC），校准性提升25-37%，且在10-20%标注数据下仍保持优势。

Conclusion: Protocol Genome能减少协议边界处的假阳性，适用于PACS系统，提供了模型卡片和部署指南，包括去标识化和偏差审计。虽然收益可能因任务而异，但该方法显著提升了跨站点医疗影像分析的性能。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the Protocol Genome, a self-supervised learning
system that learns correlations from DICOM headers and achieves AUROC 0.901 (vs
0.847 baseline) and ECE 0.036 (vs 0.058) on fully held-out external validation.
Our method also improves calibration and robustness across modalities (CT, MRI,
CXR) and vendors. Clinical imaging is funneled through PACS/DICOM, where
procedure choices (scanner make/model, sequence, kernel, kVp, TR/TE, and slice
thickness) have consequences for contrast, noise, and artifact. These latent
confounders impede the generalization of image-only networks across sites. We
consider structured DICOM headers as a label and learn protocol-aware but
clinically robust image representations. Protocol Genome obtains tokenized
embeddings of de-identified header fields and models them along with image
features using: (1) protocol-image contrastive learning, (2) masked protocol
prediction, and (3) protocol-protocol translation. With 1.26M studies (7 health
systems, 31 scanners, 3 vendors; CT, MR, CR/DR), we experiment on: (A) chest CT
triage for PE, (B) brain MRI glioma grading, and (C) chest radiograph
cardiomegaly detection. Relative to strong SSL baselines (SimCLR, MAE) as well
as ImageNet transfer, Protocol Genome (+0.046: PE, +0.058: glioma, +0.041:
cardiomegaly) is associated with higher external AUROC; 25-37% calibration
improvements are obtained (p < 0.01, DeLong tests). While the gains may be
task-dependent, they are preserved with 10-20% of labeled data. From a clinical
point of view, the technique reduces false positives at protocol borders and is
applicable in a PACS (DICOM C-FIND/C-MOVE, DICOMweb QIDO/WADO). We publish a
model card and deployment guide, complete with both de-identification and bias
audits.

*Jie Zhang,Ting Xu,Gelei Deng,Runyi Hu,Han Qiu,Tianwei Zhang,Qing Guo,Ivor Tsang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文研究了视觉语言模型在处理破碎、融合或遮挡文字时的识别能力，发现现有模型虽在清晰文本上表现强劲，但在受干扰的文字情况下性能严重下降，显示出缺乏人类的组合性识别能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究人类能够识别破碎、融合或遮挡文字的鲁棒性，而现有的先进视觉语言模型是否也具备这种能力。

Method: 构建了两个受心理物理学启发的测试标准，涉及中文象形文字和英语拼写系统，通过切割、重组和叠加字形来创造人类可读但模型难以识别的刺激物。

Result: 当代视觉语言模型在这些干扰下性能严重下降，经常产生无关或不连贯的输出，显示模型主要依赖通用视觉不变性而较少使用组合性预设知识。

Conclusion: 研究结果为开发能够编码符号分割、组合和绑定的架构提供了动力，并为多模态系统在教育、无障碍访问、文化遗产和安全领域的部署描述了具体挑战。

Abstract: Writing is a universal cultural technology that reuses vision for symbolic
communication. Humans display striking resilience: we readily recognize words
even when characters are fragmented, fused, or partially occluded. This paper
investigates whether advanced vision language models (VLMs) share this
resilience. We construct two psychophysics inspired benchmarks across distinct
writing systems, Chinese logographs and English alphabetic words, by splicing,
recombining, and overlaying glyphs to yield ''visible but unreadable'' stimuli
for models while remaining legible to humans. Despite strong performance on
clean text, contemporary VLMs show a severe drop under these perturbations,
frequently producing unrelated or incoherent outputs. The pattern suggests a
structural limitation: models heavily leverage generic visual invariances but
under rely on compositional priors needed for robust literacy. We release
stimuli generation code, prompts, and evaluation protocols to facilitate
transparent replication and follow up work. Our findings motivate architectures
and training strategies that encode symbol segmentation, composition, and
binding across scripts, and they delineate concrete challenges for deploying
multimodal systems in education, accessibility, cultural heritage, and
security.

*Guan Yu,Zhang Jianhua,Liang Dong,Liu Qiegen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种在频率域进行特征级学习的动态心脏MRI重建方法，通过时域融合策略合成k空间数据，在低数据量情况下仍能实现稳定和丰富的生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于心脏磁共振成像的动态性和复杂性，高质量且多样化的k空间数据在实践中很少可用，这阻碍了动态心脏MRI的鲁棒重建。

Method: 在频率域进行特征级学习，利用傅里叶变换的全局表示能力，将频域视为自然全局特征空间。采用时域融合策略整合不同时间帧的k空间数据，引导和优化生成轨迹。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在低数据量情况下具有很强的生成能力。

Conclusion: 该方法具有缓解动态MRI重建中数据稀缺问题的实际潜力。

Abstract: Owing to the inherently dynamic and complex characteristics of cardiac
magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging, high-quality and diverse k-space data are
rarely available in practice, which in turn hampers robust reconstruction of
dynamic cardiac MRI. To address this challenge, we perform feature-level
learning directly in the frequency domain and employ a temporal-fusion strategy
as the generative guidance to synthesize k-space data. Specifically, leveraging
the global representation capacity of the Fourier transform, the frequency
domain can be considered a natural global feature space. Therefore, unlike
traditional methods that use pixel-level convolution for feature learning and
modeling in the image domain, this letter focuses on feature-level modeling in
the frequency domain, enabling stable and rich generation even with ultra
low-data regimes. Moreover, leveraging the advantages of feature-level modeling
in the frequency domain, we integrate k-space data across time frames with
multiple fusion strategies to steer and further optimize the generative
trajectory. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method possesses
strong generative ability in low-data regimes, indicating practical potential
to alleviate data scarcity in dynamic MRI reconstruction.

*Liviu Nicolae Fircă,Antonio Bărbălau,Dan Oneata,Elena Burceanu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文首次明确评估模型在语义和感知上差异较大的类别间转移属性知识的能力，发现模型性能随着训练测试集相关性的减弱而冲击性下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估模型能否在语义和感知上差异较大的类别间转移属性知识，以了解当前模型的属性推理能力的实际限制。

Method: 通过多种训练测试集分割策略（LLM语义分组、嵌入相似度阈值、嵌入聚类、超类分区）逐渐减少训练测试集相关性，测试模型在不相关对象类型间推理共享属性的能力。

Result: 随着训练测试集相关性的降低，模型性能冲击性下降，其中聚类方法在减少隐藏相关性和保持可学习性方面表现最佳。

Conclusion: 当前表征对分割设计很敏感，属性推理能力有限，这为未来属性推理基准测试的构建提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Can models generalize attribute knowledge across semantically and
perceptually dissimilar categories? While prior work has addressed attribute
prediction within narrow taxonomic or visually similar domains, it remains
unclear whether current models can abstract attributes and apply them to
conceptually distant categories. This work presents the first explicit
evaluation for the robustness of the attribute prediction task under such
conditions, testing whether models can correctly infer shared attributes
between unrelated object types: e.g., identifying that the attribute "has four
legs" is common to both "dogs" and "chairs". To enable this evaluation, we
introduce train-test split strategies that progressively reduce correlation
between training and test sets, based on: LLM-driven semantic grouping,
embedding similarity thresholding, embedding-based clustering, and
supercategory-based partitioning using ground-truth labels. Results show a
sharp drop in performance as the correlation between training and test
categories decreases, indicating strong sensitivity to split design. Among the
evaluated methods, clustering yields the most effective trade-off, reducing
hidden correlations while preserving learnability. These findings offer new
insights into the limitations of current representations and inform future
benchmark construction for attribute reasoning.

*Ahmed R. Sadik,Mariusz Bujny*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于人在循环的量化评估框架，用于评估LLM生成的3D模型的几何和结构保真度，通过综合性指标体系进行基准测试。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然大语言模型能够解释多模态输入生成复杂3D形状，但缺乏稳健的方法来评估其几何和结构保真度。

Method: 提出了一套综合的相似性和复杂性指标，包括体积准确性、表面对齐、尺寸保真度和拓扑复杂性，并以L垂尺组件为案例研究，比较四种输入模态的性能。

Result: 发现语义丰富度越高生成保真度越好，代码级提示能够实现完美重构，并能显著加快向真实值的收敛速度。

Conclusion: 该工作不仅推进了对AI辅助形状合成的理解，还提供了可扩展的方法论来验证和精炼生成模型，支持多样化CAD应用。

Abstract: Large Language Models are increasingly capable of interpreting multimodal
inputs to generate complex 3D shapes, yet robust methods to evaluate geometric
and structural fidelity remain underdeveloped. This paper introduces a human in
the loop framework for the quantitative evaluation of LLM generated 3D models,
supporting applications such as democratization of CAD design, reverse
engineering of legacy designs, and rapid prototyping. We propose a
comprehensive suite of similarity and complexity metrics, including volumetric
accuracy, surface alignment, dimensional fidelity, and topological intricacy,
to benchmark generated models against ground truth CAD references. Using an L
bracket component as a case study, we systematically compare LLM performance
across four input modalities: 2D orthographic views, isometric sketches,
geometric structure trees, and code based correction prompts. Our findings
demonstrate improved generation fidelity with increased semantic richness, with
code level prompts achieving perfect reconstruction across all metrics. A key
contribution of this work is demonstrating that our proposed quantitative
evaluation approach enables significantly faster convergence toward the ground
truth, especially compared to traditional qualitative methods based solely on
visual inspection and human intuition. This work not only advances the
understanding of AI assisted shape synthesis but also provides a scalable
methodology to validate and refine generative models for diverse CAD
applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MEGS²是一个针对3D高斯泼溅的内存优化框架，通过联合优化基元数量和每个基元的参数，实现了显著的内存压缩，在保持渲染质量的同时减少50%静态VRAM和40%渲染VRAM。


<details>

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a dominant novel-view synthesis
technique, but its high memory consumption severely limits its applicability on
edge devices. A growing number of 3DGS compression methods have been proposed
to make 3DGS more efficient, yet most only focus on storage compression and
fail to address the critical bottleneck of rendering memory. To address this
problem, we introduce MEGS$^{2}$, a novel memory-efficient framework that
tackles this challenge by jointly optimizing two key factors: the total
primitive number and the parameters per primitive, achieving unprecedented
memory compression. Specifically, we replace the memory-intensive spherical
harmonics with lightweight arbitrarily-oriented spherical Gaussian lobes as our
color representations. More importantly, we propose a unified soft pruning
framework that models primitive-number and lobe-number pruning as a single
constrained optimization problem. Experiments show that MEGS$^{2}$ achieves a
50% static VRAM reduction and a 40% rendering VRAM reduction compared to
existing methods, while maintaining comparable rendering quality.

Abstract: We propose a novel regularization loss that enforces standard Gaussianity,
encouraging samples to align with a standard Gaussian distribution. This
facilitates a range of downstream tasks involving optimization in the latent
space of text-to-image models. We treat elements of a high-dimensional sample
as one-dimensional standard Gaussian variables and define a composite loss that
combines moment-based regularization in the spatial domain with power
spectrum-based regularization in the spectral domain. Since the expected values
of moments and power spectrum distributions are analytically known, the loss
promotes conformity to these properties. To ensure permutation invariance, the
losses are applied to randomly permuted inputs. Notably, existing
Gaussianity-based regularizations fall within our unified framework: some
correspond to moment losses of specific orders, while the previous
covariance-matching loss is equivalent to our spectral loss but incurs higher
time complexity due to its spatial-domain computation. We showcase the
application of our regularization in generative modeling for test-time reward
alignment with a text-to-image model, specifically to enhance aesthetics and
text alignment. Our regularization outperforms previous Gaussianity
regularization, effectively prevents reward hacking and accelerates
convergence.

Abstract: Image segmentation is a critical task in microscopy, essential for accurately
analyzing and interpreting complex visual data. This task can be performed
using custom models trained on domain-specific datasets, transfer learning from
pre-trained models, or foundational models that offer broad applicability.
However, foundational models often present a considerable number of
non-transparent tuning parameters that require extensive manual optimization,
limiting their usability for real-time streaming data analysis. Here, we
introduce a reward function-based optimization to fine-tune foundational models
and illustrate this approach for SAM (Segment Anything Model) framework by
Meta. The reward functions can be constructed to represent the physics of the
imaged system, including particle size distributions, geometries, and other
criteria. By integrating a reward-driven optimization framework, we enhance
SAM's adaptability and performance, leading to an optimized variant, SAM$^{*}$,
that better aligns with the requirements of diverse segmentation tasks and
particularly allows for real-time streaming data segmentation. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of this approach in microscopy imaging, where precise
segmentation is crucial for analyzing cellular structures, material interfaces,
and nanoscale features.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于块稀疏核的注意力机制替代方案，用于解决多视图重建中transformer模型的二次复杂度瓶颈问题，实现了4倍加速且保持性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的transformer-based多视图重建模型（如VGGT和π³）虽然效果出色，但由于全局注意力层的二次复杂度，在处理大规模图像集时存在运行时瓶颈。通过分析发现注意力矩阵的概率质量集中在少量与跨视图几何匹配对应的patch-patch交互上。

Method: 受结构化注意力和大语言模型最新进展的启发，提出使用高度优化的块稀疏核来替代密集的全局注意力操作。该方法无需重新训练主干网络，可同时适用于VGGT和π³模型，并支持大规模图像集合。

Result: 在全面的多视图基准测试套件上的评估表明，该方法实现了高达4倍的推理加速，同时保持了可比较的任务性能。

Conclusion: 提出的块稀疏注意力机制有效解决了多视图重建中transformer模型的 scalability 问题，为处理大规模图像集提供了高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Efficient and accurate feed-forward multi-view reconstruction has long been
an important task in computer vision. Recent transformer-based models like VGGT
and $\pi^3$ have achieved impressive results with simple architectures, yet
they face an inherent runtime bottleneck, due to the quadratic complexity of
the global attention layers, that limits the scalability to large image sets.
In this paper, we empirically analyze the global attention matrix of these
models and observe that probability mass concentrates on a small subset of
patch-patch interactions that correspond to cross-view geometric matches.
Motivated by the structured attention and inspired by recent advancement in
large language models, we propose a replacement for the dense global attention
operation based on highly optimized block-sparse kernels, yielding up to
$4\times$ faster inference with comparable task performance. Our retrofit
requires no retraining of the backbone, extends to both VGGT and $\pi^3$, and
supports large image collections. Evaluations on a comprehensive suite of
multi-view benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前将VIO卸载到边缘服务器的趋势会扩大服务器端威胁面，细微的姿态欺骗可能累积成显著漂移，同时逃避启发式检查，需要有效的安全防护机制。

Method: 提出无监督、无标签的检测和恢复机制，在无攻击会话上训练模型学习运动时间规律性，检测运行时偏差并启动恢复过程以恢复姿态一致性。

Result: 在真实卸载VIO环境中使用ILLIXR测试平台评估，跨多个欺骗强度实验结果显示，相比无防御基线，轨迹和姿态误差显著降低。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效检测和恢复VIO系统中的姿态欺骗攻击，提高系统的安全性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Visual-Inertial Odometry (VIO) supports immersive Virtual Reality (VR) by
fusing camera and Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) data for real-time pose.
However, current trend of offloading VIO to edge servers can lead server-side
threat surface where subtle pose spoofing can accumulate into substantial
drift, while evading heuristic checks. In this paper, we study this threat and
present an unsupervised, label-free detection and recovery mechanism. The
proposed model is trained on attack-free sessions to learn temporal
regularities of motion to detect runtime deviations and initiate recovery to
restore pose consistency. We evaluate the approach in a realistic offloaded-VIO
environment using ILLIXR testbed across multiple spoofing intensities.
Experimental results in terms of well-known performance metrics show
substantial reductions in trajectory and pose error compared to a no-defense
baseline.

Motivation: 研究假设人脸增强技术在提升感知质量的同时会降低深度伪造检测器的性能，旨在系统评估这些技术是否可作为反取证工具使用。

Method: 使用传统图像处理方法和先进的基于GAN的增强技术，在FaceForensics++、DeepFakeDetection和CelebDF-v2数据集上评估对朴素、空间和频域检测方法的影响，并进行对抗训练实验。

Result: 基础增强滤波器可将检测准确率显著降低（ASR达64.63%），而基于GAN的技术进一步利用这些漏洞（ASR达75.12%）。

Conclusion: 人脸增强方法能有效作为反取证工具，强调了需要开发更具弹性和适应性的取证方法。

Abstract: Face enhancement techniques are widely used to enhance facial appearance.
However, they can inadvertently distort biometric features, leading to
significant decrease in the accuracy of deepfake detectors. This study
hypothesizes that these techniques, while improving perceptual quality, can
degrade the performance of deepfake detectors. To investigate this, we
systematically evaluate whether commonly used face enhancement methods can
serve an anti-forensic role by reducing detection accuracy. We use both
traditional image processing methods and advanced GAN-based enhancements to
evaluate the robustness of deepfake detectors. We provide a comprehensive
analysis of the effectiveness of these enhancement techniques, focusing on
their impact on Na\"ive, Spatial, and Frequency-based detection methods.
Furthermore, we conduct adversarial training experiments to assess whether
exposure to face enhancement transformations improves model robustness.
Experiments conducted on the FaceForensics++, DeepFakeDetection, and CelebDF-v2
datasets indicate that even basic enhancement filters can significantly reduce
detection accuracy achieving ASR up to 64.63\%. In contrast, GAN-based
techniques further exploit these vulnerabilities, achieving ASR up to 75.12\%.
Our results demonstrate that face enhancement methods can effectively function
as anti-forensic tools, emphasizing the need for more resilient and adaptive
forensic methods.

Abstract: Working with annotated data is the cornerstone of supervised learning.
Nevertheless, providing labels to instances is a task that requires significant
human effort. Several critical real-world applications make things more
complicated because no matter how many labels may have been identified in a
task of interest, it could be the case that examples corresponding to novel
classes may appear in the future. Not unsurprisingly, prior work in this,
so-called, `open-world' context has focused a lot on semi-supervised
approaches.
  Focusing on image classification, somehow paradoxically, we propose a fully
unsupervised approach to the problem of determining the novel categories in a
particular dataset. Our approach relies on estimating the number of clusters
using Vision Transformers, which utilize attention mechanisms to generate
vector embeddings. Furthermore, we incorporate manifold learning techniques to
refine these embeddings by exploiting the intrinsic geometry of the data,
thereby enhancing the overall image clustering performance. Overall, we
establish new State-of-the-Art results on single-modal clustering and Novel
Class Discovery on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, ImageNet-100, and Tiny ImageNet. We do
so, both when the number of clusters is known or unknown ahead of time. The

TL;DR: XBusNet是一个双提示双分支多模态模型，结合图像特征和临床文本提示，在乳腺超声分割中实现最先进性能，特别对小病灶效果显著提升


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 乳腺超声精确分割对可靠测量和定量分析至关重要，但小病灶或低对比度病灶由于边界模糊和斑点噪声而难以分割。文本提示能提供临床上下文，但直接应用弱定位的文本-图像线索会产生粗糙的分割结果

Method: 提出XBusNet模型，包含全局路径（基于CLIP Vision Transformer编码全图像语义）和局部路径（U-Net强调精确边界），通过自动从结构化元数据组装的文本提示进行调制，描述形状、边缘和BI-RADS术语

Result: 在BLU数据集上达到Dice系数0.8765和IoU 0.8149的最先进性能，优于六个强基线模型。小病灶提升最明显，减少了遗漏区域和虚假激活

Conclusion: 双提示双分支多模态设计通过融合全局语义和局部精度，能够产生准确的乳腺超声分割掩码，并提高对小而低对比度病灶的鲁棒性

Abstract: Background: Precise breast ultrasound (BUS) segmentation supports reliable
measurement, quantitative analysis, and downstream classification, yet remains
difficult for small or low-contrast lesions with fuzzy margins and speckle
noise. Text prompts can add clinical context, but directly applying weakly
localized text-image cues (e.g., CAM/CLIP-derived signals) tends to produce
coarse, blob-like responses that smear boundaries unless additional mechanisms
recover fine edges. Methods: We propose XBusNet, a novel dual-prompt,
dual-branch multimodal model that combines image features with clinically
grounded text. A global pathway based on a CLIP Vision Transformer encodes
whole-image semantics conditioned on lesion size and location, while a local
U-Net pathway emphasizes precise boundaries and is modulated by prompts that
describe shape, margin, and Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS)
terms. Prompts are assembled automatically from structured metadata, requiring
no manual clicks. We evaluate on the Breast Lesions USG (BLU) dataset using
five-fold cross-validation. Primary metrics are Dice and Intersection over
Union (IoU); we also conduct size-stratified analyses and ablations to assess
the roles of the global and local paths and the text-driven modulation.
Results: XBusNet achieves state-of-the-art performance on BLU, with mean Dice
of 0.8765 and IoU of 0.8149, outperforming six strong baselines. Small lesions
show the largest gains, with fewer missed regions and fewer spurious
activations. Ablation studies show complementary contributions of global
context, local boundary modeling, and prompt-based modulation. Conclusions: A
dual-prompt, dual-branch multimodal design that merges global semantics with
local precision yields accurate BUS segmentation masks and improves robustness
for small, low-contrast lesions.

Abstract: Data scarcity hinders deep learning for medical imaging. We propose a
framework for breast cancer classification in thermograms that addresses this
using a Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DPM) for data augmentation. Our
DPM-based augmentation is shown to be superior to both traditional methods and
a ProGAN baseline. The framework fuses deep features from a pre-trained
ResNet-50 with handcrafted nonlinear features (e.g., Fractal Dimension) derived
from U-Net segmented tumors. An XGBoost classifier trained on these fused
features achieves 98.0\% accuracy and 98.1\% sensitivity. Ablation studies and
statistical tests confirm that both the DPM augmentation and the nonlinear
feature fusion are critical, statistically significant components of this
success. This work validates the synergy between advanced generative models and
interpretable features for creating highly accurate medical diagnostic tools.

Conclusion: RecA是一种高效通用的后训练对齐策略，适用于自回归、掩码自回归和基于扩散的统一多模态模型，能够一致地改善生成和编辑保真度

Abstract: Unified multimodal models (UMMs) unify visual understanding and generation
within a single architecture. However, conventional training relies on
image-text pairs (or sequences) whose captions are typically sparse and miss
fine-grained visual details--even when they use hundreds of words to describe a
simple image. We introduce Reconstruction Alignment (RecA), a
resource-efficient post-training method that leverages visual understanding
encoder embeddings as dense "text prompts," providing rich supervision without
captions. Concretely, RecA conditions a UMM on its own visual understanding
embeddings and optimizes it to reconstruct the input image with a
self-supervised reconstruction loss, thereby realigning understanding and
generation. Despite its simplicity, RecA is broadly applicable: across
autoregressive, masked-autoregressive, and diffusion-based UMMs, it
consistently improves generation and editing fidelity. With only 27 GPU-hours,
post-training with RecA substantially improves image generation performance on
GenEval (0.73$\rightarrow$0.90) and DPGBench (80.93$\rightarrow$88.15), while
also boosting editing benchmarks (ImgEdit 3.38$\rightarrow$3.75, GEdit
6.94$\rightarrow$7.25). Notably, RecA surpasses much larger open-source models
and applies broadly across diverse UMM architectures, establishing it as an
efficient and general post-training alignment strategy for UMMs

Conclusion: 基于Mamba线性复杂度的DEPF方法有效解决了无人机多光谱目标检测的关键挑战，在提升检测性能的同时保持了计算效率

Abstract: Multispectral remote sensing object detection is one of the important
application of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). However, it faces three
challenges. Firstly, the low-light remote sensing images reduce the
complementarity during multi-modality fusion. Secondly, the local small target
modeling is interfered with redundant information in the fusion stage easily.
Thirdly, due to the quadratic computational complexity, it is hard to apply the
transformer-based methods on the UAV platform. To address these limitations,
motivated by Mamba with linear complexity, a UAV multispectral object detector
with dual-domain enhancement and priority-guided mamba fusion (DEPF) is
proposed. Firstly, to enhance low-light remote sensing images, Dual-Domain
Enhancement Module (DDE) is designed, which contains Cross-Scale Wavelet Mamba
(CSWM) and Fourier Details Recovery block (FDR). CSWM applies cross-scale mamba
scanning for the low-frequency components to enhance the global brightness of
images, while FDR constructs spectrum recovery network to enhance the frequency
spectra features for recovering the texture-details. Secondly, to enhance local
target modeling and reduce the impact of redundant information during fusion,
Priority-Guided Mamba Fusion Module (PGMF) is designed. PGMF introduces the
concept of priority scanning, which starts from local targets features
according to the priority scores obtained from modality difference. Experiments
on DroneVehicle dataset and VEDAI dataset reports that, DEPF performs well on
object detection, comparing with state-of-the-art methods. Our code is
available in the supplementary material.

Conclusion: G$^{3}$CN方法通过拓扑图精炼和门控机制有效解决了骨架动作识别中模糊动作区分的问题，为GCN框架提供了改进方案

Abstract: Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) have proven to be highly effective for
skeleton-based action recognition, primarily due to their ability to leverage
graph topology for feature aggregation, a key factor in extracting meaningful
representations. However, despite their success, GCNs often struggle to
effectively distinguish between ambiguous actions, revealing limitations in the
representation of learned topological and spatial features. To address this
challenge, we propose a novel approach, Gaussian Topology Refinement Gated
Graph Convolution (G$^{3}$CN), to address the challenge of distinguishing
ambiguous actions in skeleton-based action recognition. G$^{3}$CN incorporates
a Gaussian filter to refine the skeleton topology graph, improving the
representation of ambiguous actions. Additionally, Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs)
are integrated into the GCN framework to enhance information propagation
between skeleton points. Our method shows strong generalization across various
GCN backbones. Extensive experiments on NTU RGB+D, NTU RGB+D 120, and NW-UCLA
benchmarks demonstrate that G$^{3}$CN effectively improves action recognition,
particularly for ambiguous samples.

Conclusion: PGVL通过有效的多模态交互机制，解决了遮挡场景下人体姿态估计的挑战，代码即将发布

Abstract: Parse graphs boost human pose estimation (HPE) by integrating context and
hierarchies, yet prior work mostly focuses on single modality modeling,
ignoring the potential of multimodal fusion. Notably, language offers rich HPE
priors like spatial relations for occluded scenes, but existing visual-language
fusion via global feature integration weakens occluded region responses and
causes alignment and location failures. To address this issue, we propose Parse
Graph-based Visual-Language interaction (PGVL) with a core novel Guided Module
(GM). In PGVL, low-level nodes focus on local features, maximizing the
maintenance of responses in occluded areas and high-level nodes integrate
global features to infer occluded or invisible parts. GM enables high semantic
nodes to guide the feature update of low semantic nodes that have undergone
cross attention. It ensuring effective fusion of diverse information. PGVL
includes top-down decomposition and bottom-up composition. In the first stage,
modality specific parse graphs are constructed. Next stage. recursive
bidirectional cross-attention is used, purified by GM. We also design network
based on PGVL. The PGVL and our network is validated on major pose estimation
datasets. We will release the code soon.

Result: 在文本和图像条件多视角扩散模型上表现出优越性能，模块化设计支持灵活整合多个扩散先验，仅需6.9万多视角实例即可高效收敛

Conclusion: LGAA框架成功实现了端到端的PBR材质3D资产生成，统一了几何和材质建模，具有高效收敛和灵活扩展的优点

Abstract: The labor- and experience-intensive creation of 3D assets with physically
based rendering (PBR) materials demands an autonomous 3D asset creation
pipeline. However, most existing 3D generation methods focus on geometry
modeling, either baking textures into simple vertex colors or leaving texture
synthesis to post-processing with image diffusion models. To achieve end-to-end
PBR-ready 3D asset generation, we present Lightweight Gaussian Asset Adapter
(LGAA), a novel framework that unifies the modeling of geometry and PBR
materials by exploiting multi-view (MV) diffusion priors from a novel
perspective. The LGAA features a modular design with three components.
Specifically, the LGAA Wrapper reuses and adapts network layers from MV
diffusion models, which encapsulate knowledge acquired from billions of images,
enabling better convergence in a data-efficient manner. To incorporate multiple
diffusion priors for geometry and PBR synthesis, the LGAA Switcher aligns
multiple LGAA Wrapper layers encapsulating different knowledge. Then, a tamed
variational autoencoder (VAE), termed LGAA Decoder, is designed to predict 2D
Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) with PBR channels. Finally, we introduce a dedicated
post-processing procedure to effectively extract high-quality, relightable mesh
assets from the resulting 2DGS. Extensive quantitative and qualitative
experiments demonstrate the superior performance of LGAA with both text-and
image-conditioned MV diffusion models. Additionally, the modular design enables
flexible incorporation of multiple diffusion priors, and the
knowledge-preserving scheme leads to efficient convergence trained on merely
69k multi-view instances. Our code, pre-trained weights, and the dataset used
will be publicly available via our project page:

TL;DR: 提出了EgoGazeVQA基准，利用注视信息提升多模态大模型在自我中心视频中的意图理解能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准忽略了注视作为用户意图指示器的重要作用，自我中心视频通过统一坐标系直接捕捉用户焦点、动作和上下文，为个性化AI体验提供了机会

Method: 构建了基于注视的问答对数据集，由MLLMs生成并经人工标注精炼；提出了注视引导的意图提示方法，整合空间、时间和意图相关线索

Result: 现有MLLMs难以准确解释用户意图，而注视引导方法显著提升了性能；分析了注视估计精度对提示效果的影响

Conclusion: 注视信息对于在自我中心环境中实现更个性化和有效的AI助手具有重要价值

Abstract: The emergence of advanced multimodal large language models (MLLMs) has
significantly enhanced AI assistants' ability to process complex information
across modalities. Recently, egocentric videos, by directly capturing user
focus, actions, and context in an unified coordinate, offer an exciting
opportunity to enable proactive and personalized AI user experiences with
MLLMs. However, existing benchmarks overlook the crucial role of gaze as an
indicator of user intent. To address this gap, we introduce EgoGazeVQA, an
egocentric gaze-guided video question answering benchmark that leverages gaze
information to improve the understanding of longer daily-life videos.
EgoGazeVQA consists of gaze-based QA pairs generated by MLLMs and refined by
human annotators. Our experiments reveal that existing MLLMs struggle to
accurately interpret user intentions. In contrast, our gaze-guided intent
prompting methods significantly enhance performance by integrating spatial,
temporal, and intent-related cues. We further conduct experiments on
gaze-related fine-tuning and analyze how gaze estimation accuracy impacts
prompting effectiveness. These results underscore the value of gaze for more
personalized and effective AI assistants in egocentric settings.

Abstract: Cross-View Geo-Localization (CVGL) focuses on identifying correspondences
between images captured from distinct perspectives of the same geographical
location. However, existing CVGL approaches are typically restricted to a
single view or modality, and their direct visual matching strategy lacks
interpretability: they merely predict whether two images correspond, without
explaining the rationale behind the match. In this paper, we present GLEAM-C, a
foundational CVGL model that unifies multiple views and modalities-including
UAV imagery, street maps, panoramic views, and ground photographs-by aligning
them exclusively with satellite imagery. Our framework enhances training
efficiency through optimized implementation while achieving accuracy comparable
to prior modality-specific CVGL models through a two-phase training strategy.
Moreover, to address the lack of interpretability in traditional CVGL methods,
we leverage the reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language models
(MLLMs) to propose a new task, GLEAM-X, which combines cross-view
correspondence prediction with explainable reasoning. To support this task, we
construct a bilingual benchmark using GPT-4o and Doubao-1.5-Thinking-Vision-Pro
to generate training and testing data. The test set is further refined through
detailed human revision, enabling systematic evaluation of explainable
cross-view reasoning and advancing transparency and scalability in
geo-localization. Together, GLEAM-C and GLEAM-X form a comprehensive CVGL
pipeline that integrates multi-modal, multi-view alignment with interpretable
correspondence analysis, unifying accurate cross-view matching with explainable
reasoning and advancing Geo-Localization by enabling models to better Explain
And Match. Code and datasets used in this work will be made publicly accessible

TL;DR: XOCT是一个深度学习框架，通过跨维度监督和多尺度特征融合实现视网膜层感知的血管重建，从OCT图像生成高质量OCTA图像


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统OCTA图像获取困难且成本高，现有深度学习方法忽略视网膜层间血管差异，难以重建诊断所需的密集血管细节

Method: 结合跨维度监督(CDS)模块和多尺度特征融合(MSFF)网络，CDS使用2D分层投影作为监督信号，MSFF通过多尺度特征提取和通道重加权策略增强血管描绘

Result: 在OCTA-500数据集上表现优异，特别是在临床评估重要的en-face投影方面有显著改进

Conclusion: XOCT有潜力提高OCTA的可访问性、可靠性和诊断价值，用于眼科疾病的检测和监测

Abstract: Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography (OCTA) and its derived en-face
projections provide high-resolution visualization of the retinal and choroidal
vasculature, which is critical for the rapid and accurate diagnosis of retinal
diseases. However, acquiring high-quality OCTA images is challenging due to
motion sensitivity and the high costs associated with software modifications
for conventional OCT devices. Moreover, current deep learning methods for
OCT-to-OCTA translation often overlook the vascular differences across retinal
layers and struggle to reconstruct the intricate, dense vascular details
necessary for reliable diagnosis. To overcome these limitations, we propose
XOCT, a novel deep learning framework that integrates Cross-Dimensional
Supervision (CDS) with a Multi-Scale Feature Fusion (MSFF) network for
layer-aware vascular reconstruction. Our CDS module leverages 2D layer-wise
en-face projections, generated via segmentation-weighted z-axis averaging, as
supervisory signals to compel the network to learn distinct representations for
each retinal layer through fine-grained, targeted guidance. Meanwhile, the MSFF
module enhances vessel delineation through multi-scale feature extraction
combined with a channel reweighting strategy, effectively capturing vascular
details at multiple spatial scales. Our experiments on the OCTA-500 dataset
demonstrate XOCT's improvements, especially for the en-face projections which
are significant for clinical evaluation of retinal pathologies, underscoring
its potential to enhance OCTA accessibility, reliability, and diagnostic value
for ophthalmic disease detection and monitoring. The code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络往往依赖训练数据中的偏见相关性，导致在医疗和自动驾驶等安全关键领域产生偏视或不公平预测，需要一种无需重新训练的后照修正方法

Method: 采用偏见感知机器忘记方法，通过Gradient Ascent、LoRA和Teacher-Student蒸聚等技术选择性移除偏见样本或特征表示，基于隐私保护忘记技术

Result: 在CUB-200-2011、CIFAR-10和CelebA三个数据集上，人口平等性分别提升94.86%、30.28%和97.37%，在保持准确性的同时显著减少了子组差异，方法在效用性、公平性、质量和隐私综合评估中平均得分0.62

Conclusion: 机器忘记技术为部署视觉系统提供了一种实用的后照公平性增强框架，无需完全重新训练，在多种偏见类型上都可以有效减少子组差异

Abstract: Deep neural networks often rely on spurious correlations in training data,
leading to biased or unfair predictions in safety-critical domains such as
medicine and autonomous driving. While conventional bias mitigation typically
requires retraining from scratch or redesigning data pipelines, recent advances
in machine unlearning provide a promising alternative for post-hoc model
correction. In this work, we investigate \textit{Bias-Aware Machine
Unlearning}, a paradigm that selectively removes biased samples or feature
representations to mitigate diverse forms of bias in vision models. Building on
privacy-preserving unlearning techniques, we evaluate various strategies
including Gradient Ascent, LoRA, and Teacher-Student distillation. Through
empirical analysis on three benchmark datasets, CUB-200-2011 (pose bias),
CIFAR-10 (synthetic patch bias), and CelebA (gender bias in smile detection),
we demonstrate that post-hoc unlearning can substantially reduce subgroup
disparities, with improvements in demographic parity of up to \textbf{94.86\%}
on CUB-200, \textbf{30.28\%} on CIFAR-10, and \textbf{97.37\%} on CelebA. These
gains are achieved with minimal accuracy loss and with methods scoring an
average of 0.62 across the 3 settings on the joint evaluation of utility,
fairness, quality, and privacy. Our findings establish machine unlearning as a
practical framework for enhancing fairness in deployed vision systems without
necessitating full retraining.

Abstract: Despite the rapid advancements in video generation technology, creating
high-quality videos that precisely align with user intentions remains a
significant challenge. Existing methods often fail to achieve fine-grained
control over video details, limiting their practical applicability. We
introduce ANYPORTAL, a novel zero-shot framework for video background
replacement that leverages pre-trained diffusion models. Our framework
collaboratively integrates the temporal prior of video diffusion models with
the relighting capabilities of image diffusion models in a zero-shot setting.
To address the critical challenge of foreground consistency, we propose a
Refinement Projection Algorithm, which enables pixel-level detail manipulation
to ensure precise foreground preservation. ANYPORTAL is training-free and
overcomes the challenges of achieving foreground consistency and temporally
coherent relighting. Experimental results demonstrate that ANYPORTAL achieves
high-quality results on consumer-grade GPUs, offering a practical and efficient
solution for video content creation and editing.

Conclusion: 该研究提出的新方法有效解决了向量图形自动动画的挑战，为计算机图形学领域提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Vector graphics, known for their scalability and user-friendliness, provide a
unique approach to visual content compared to traditional pixel-based images.
Animation of these graphics, driven by the motion of their elements, offers
enhanced comprehensibility and controllability but often requires substantial
manual effort. To automate this process, we propose a novel method that
integrates implicit neural representations with text-to-video diffusion models
for vector graphic animation. Our approach employs layered implicit neural
representations to reconstruct vector graphics, preserving their inherent
properties such as infinite resolution and precise color and shape constraints,
which effectively bridges the large domain gap between vector graphics and
diffusion models. The neural representations are then optimized using video
score distillation sampling, which leverages motion priors from pretrained
text-to-video diffusion models. Finally, the vector graphics are warped to
match the representations resulting in smooth animation. Experimental results
validate the effectiveness of our method in generating vivid and natural vector
graphic animations, demonstrating significant improvement over existing
techniques that suffer from limitations in flexibility and animation quality.

Abstract: We address vision-language-driven indoor navigation to assist visually

Method: 提出统一框架DiGS，将SDF学习直接嵌入3DGS流程，为每个高斯基元关联可学习SDF值，并设计几何引导的多尺度网格生长策略。

Result: 在DTU、Mip-NeRF 360和Tanks&Temples等标准基准测试中，DiGS在保持高渲染保真度的同时，显著提高了重建准确性和完整性。

Conclusion: DiGS通过整合SDF学习到3D高斯泼溅中，成功实现了更好的几何一致性和表面重建质量，为3D重建提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has recently emerged as a powerful paradigm for
photorealistic view synthesis, representing scenes with spatially distributed
Gaussian primitives. While highly effective for rendering, achieving accurate
and complete surface reconstruction remains challenging due to the unstructured
nature of the representation and the absence of explicit geometric supervision.
In this work, we propose DiGS, a unified framework that embeds Signed Distance
Field (SDF) learning directly into the 3DGS pipeline, thereby enforcing strong
and interpretable surface priors. By associating each Gaussian with a learnable
SDF value, DiGS explicitly aligns primitives with underlying geometry and
improves cross-view consistency. To further ensure dense and coherent coverage,
we design a geometry-guided grid growth strategy that adaptively distributes
Gaussians along geometry-consistent regions under a multi-scale hierarchy.
Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks, including DTU, Mip-NeRF 360, and
Tanks& Temples, demonstrate that DiGS consistently improves reconstruction
accuracy and completeness while retaining high rendering fidelity.

Motivation: 深度神经网络容易受到对抗性攻击，当前的混合策略存在毁坏全局语义特征、导致对抗性优化偏差以及梯度消失等问题，影响对抗性示例的质量和可转移性。

Method: 1. 局部混合策略：仅混合局部区域保持全局语义一致性，产生多样化输入

Conclusion: 通过局部混合策略和logits优化的结合，本文方法有效解决了传统混合方法的限制，显著提升了对抗性示例的质量和可转移性，为提高模型稳健性提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) are vulnerable to adversarial attacks, posing
significant security threats to their deployment in remote sensing
applications. Research on adversarial attacks not only reveals model
vulnerabilities but also provides critical insights for enhancing robustness.
Although current mixing-based strategies have been proposed to increase the
transferability of adversarial examples, they either perform global blending or
directly exchange a region in the images, which may destroy global semantic
features and mislead the optimization of adversarial examples. Furthermore,
their reliance on cross-entropy loss for perturbation optimization leads to
gradient diminishing during iterative updates, compromising adversarial example
quality. To address these limitations, we focus on non-targeted attacks and
propose a novel framework via local mixing and logits optimization. First, we
present a local mixing strategy to generate diverse yet semantically consistent
inputs. Different from MixUp, which globally blends two images, and MixCut,
which stitches images together, our method merely blends local regions to
preserve global semantic information. Second, we adapt the logit loss from
targeted attacks to non-targeted scenarios, mitigating the gradient vanishing
problem of cross-entropy loss. Third, a perturbation smoothing loss is applied
to suppress high-frequency noise and enhance transferability. Extensive
experiments on FGSCR-42 and MTARSI datasets demonstrate superior performance
over 12 state-of-the-art methods across 6 surrogate models. Notably, with
ResNet as the surrogate on MTARSI, our method achieves a 17.28% average
improvement in black-box attack success rate.

Conclusion: MVAT框架有效解决了弱监督3D检测中的投影模糊性问题，无需任何3D框标注即可实现高性能检测，为3D感知任务提供了实用的弱监督解决方案

Abstract: Annotating 3D data remains a costly bottleneck for 3D object detection,
motivating the development of weakly supervised annotation methods that rely on
more accessible 2D box annotations. However, relying solely on 2D boxes
introduces projection ambiguities since a single 2D box can correspond to
multiple valid 3D poses. Furthermore, partial object visibility under a single
viewpoint setting makes accurate 3D box estimation difficult. We propose MVAT,
a novel framework that leverages temporal multi-view present in sequential data
to address these challenges. Our approach aggregates object-centric point
clouds across time to build 3D object representations as dense and complete as
possible. A Teacher-Student distillation paradigm is employed: The Teacher
network learns from single viewpoints but targets are derived from temporally
aggregated static objects. Then the Teacher generates high quality
pseudo-labels that the Student learns to predict from a single viewpoint for
both static and moving objects. The whole framework incorporates a multi-view
2D projection loss to enforce consistency between predicted 3D boxes and all
available 2D annotations. Experiments on the nuScenes and Waymo Open datasets
demonstrate that MVAT achieves state-of-the-art performance for weakly
supervised 3D object detection, significantly narrowing the gap with fully
supervised methods without requiring any 3D box annotations. % \footnote{Code

capture system provides precise ground-truth hand landmark tracking, and all
devices are spatially calibrated and synchronized to ensure cross-modal
alignment. Moreover, to embed an action quality task within gesture
understanding, collected recordings are organized in classes of execution speed
that mirror clinical evaluations of hand dexterity. Baseline experiments
highlight the dataset's potential for gesture classification, gesture trigger
detection, and action quality assessment. Thus, EHWGesture can serve as a
comprehensive benchmark for advancing multimodal clinical gesture
understanding.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UFC是一个通用的少样本控制适配器，能够在少量样本下泛化到新的空间控制条件，仅需30个标注样本就能实现精细控制，性能可与全监督基线相媲美。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的控制适配器在面对与训练任务差异较大的新空间控制条件时，适应能力有限且训练成本高，需要解决这一局限性。

Method: 提出UFC通用少样本控制适配器，通过查询条件和支持条件之间的类比来构建任务特定的控制特征，使用匹配机制和小型任务特定参数更新。

Result: 在6个新空间控制任务上的实验表明，UFC仅用30个标注样本就能实现与空间条件一致的精细控制，使用0.1%的全训练数据即可达到与全监督基线竞争的性能。

Conclusion: UFC能够灵活应用于各种扩散骨干网络（UNet和DiT），是一种高效且通用的少样本空间控制解决方案。

Abstract: Spatial conditioning in pretrained text-to-image diffusion models has
significantly improved fine-grained control over the structure of generated
images. However, existing control adapters exhibit limited adaptability and
incur high training costs when encountering novel spatial control conditions
that differ substantially from the training tasks. To address this limitation,
we propose Universal Few-Shot Control (UFC), a versatile few-shot control
adapter capable of generalizing to novel spatial conditions. Given a few
image-condition pairs of an unseen task and a query condition, UFC leverages
the analogy between query and support conditions to construct task-specific
control features, instantiated by a matching mechanism and an update on a small
set of task-specific parameters. Experiments on six novel spatial control tasks
show that UFC, fine-tuned with only 30 annotated examples of novel tasks,
achieves fine-grained control consistent with the spatial conditions. Notably,
when fine-tuned with 0.1% of the full training data, UFC achieves competitive
performance with the fully supervised baselines in various control tasks. We
also show that UFC is applicable agnostically to various diffusion backbones
and demonstrate its effectiveness on both UNet and DiT architectures. Code is

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种基于Hounsfield单位(HU)的前景隐码策略，改善了3D医学图像中的掩码图像建模性能，在多个公开数据集上获得显著的分割效果提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的随机掩码策略在3D医学图像中忽视了解剖结构的密度分布，导致掩码图像建模在医学领域的应用受限。

Method: 利用Hounsfield单位(HU)测量实现HU基于前景隐码，重点关注内臭器官的强度分布，排除空气和液体等无诊断价值的非组织区域。

Result: 在5个公开3D医学图像数据集上获得显著提升：BTCV(~84.64%)、Flare22(~92.43%)、MM-WHS(~90.67%)、Amos22(~88.64%)、BraTS(~78.55%)的Dice分数。

Conclusion: 领域中心的掩码图像建模对医学图像表征学习致关重要，为医学图像分割提供了有前景的研究方向。

Abstract: While Masked Image Modeling (MIM) has revolutionized fields of computer
vision, its adoption in 3D medical image computing has been limited by the use
of random masking, which overlooks the density of anatomical objects. To
address this limitation, we enhance the pretext task with a simple yet
effective masking strategy. Leveraging Hounsfield Unit (HU) measurements, we
implement an HU-based Foreground Masking, which focuses on the intensity
distribution of visceral organs and excludes non-tissue regions, such as air
and fluid, that lack diagnostically meaningful features. Extensive experiments
on five public 3D medical imaging datasets demonstrate that our masking
consistently improves performance, both in quality of segmentation and Dice
score (BTCV:~84.64\%, Flare22:~92.43\%, MM-WHS:~90.67\%, Amos22:~88.64\%,
BraTS:~78.55\%). These results underscore the importance of domain-centric MIM
and suggest a promising direction for representation learning in medical image
segmentation. Implementation is available at github.com/AISeedHub/SubFore/.

Conclusion: TextlessRAG为语音文档问答提供了创新解决方案，通过消除中间文本转换步骤实现了更高效的端到端处理。

Abstract: Document images encapsulate a wealth of knowledge, while the portability of
spoken queries enables broader and flexible application scenarios. Yet, no
prior work has explored knowledge base question answering over visual document
images with queries provided directly in speech. We propose TextlessRAG, the
first end-to-end framework for speech-based question answering over large-scale
document images. Unlike prior methods, TextlessRAG eliminates ASR, TTS and OCR,
directly interpreting speech, retrieving relevant visual knowledge, and
generating answers in a fully textless pipeline. To further boost performance,
we integrate a layout-aware reranking mechanism to refine retrieval.
Experiments demonstrate substantial improvements in both efficiency and
accuracy. To advance research in this direction, we also release the first
bilingual speech--document RAG dataset, featuring Chinese and English voice
queries paired with multimodal document content. Both the dataset and our
pipeline will be made available at

TL;DR: 从单张无姿态图片通过前向传播框架快速生成高质量的全头部Gaussian模型，避免了以往GAN逆向化和测试时优化的耗时问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决从单张无姿态图片快速重建高质量3D头部模型的挑战，避免传统方法的计算成本和时间消耗问题。

Method: 提出了一个双分支框架，通过细到粗的Gaussian头部生成流水线，利用FLAME模型的稀疏点与图像特征交互，结合结构化球面三平面特征和非结构化点基特征进行高效重建。

Result: 实验结果显示该框架在高效率和高保真度方面都显示出优勃性能，能够在单次前向传播中完成高质量的全头部Gaussian模型重建。

Conclusion: 该前向传播框架为单图3D头部重建提供了一种高效、高质量的解决方案，在速度和质量方面都显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: We present a feed-forward framework for Gaussian full-head synthesis from a
single unposed image. Unlike previous work that relies on time-consuming GAN
inversion and test-time optimization, our framework can reconstruct the
Gaussian full-head model given a single unposed image in a single forward pass.
This enables fast reconstruction and rendering during inference. To mitigate
the lack of large-scale 3D head assets, we propose a large-scale synthetic
dataset from trained 3D GANs and train our framework using only synthetic data.
For efficient high-fidelity generation, we introduce a coarse-to-fine Gaussian
head generation pipeline, where sparse points from the FLAME model interact
with the image features by transformer blocks for feature extraction and coarse
shape reconstruction, which are then densified for high-fidelity
reconstruction. To fully leverage the prior knowledge residing in pretrained 3D
GANs for effective reconstruction, we propose a dual-branch framework that
effectively aggregates the structured spherical triplane feature and
unstructured point-based features for more effective Gaussian head
reconstruction. Experimental results show the effectiveness of our framework
towards existing work.

Conclusion: CGAT架构能够生成人类可理解的注意力图，增强信任并促进专家验证模型决策。虽然基于牙科数据演示，但CGAT广泛适用于基于图的分类和回归任务，促进透明深度学习模型在高风险环境中的更广泛采用。

Abstract: Deep learning offers a promising avenue for automating many recognition tasks
in fields such as medicine and forensics. However, the black-box nature of
these models hinders their adoption in high-stakes applications where trust and
accountability are required. For 3D shape recognition tasks in particular, this
paper introduces the Class Node Graph Attention Network (CGAT) architecture to
address this need. Applied to 3D meshes of third molars derived from CBCT
images, for Demirjian stage allocation, CGAT utilizes graph attention
convolutions and an inherent attention mechanism, visualized via attention
rollout, to explain its decision-making process. We evaluated the local mean
curvature and distance to centroid node features, both individually and in
combination, as well as model depth, finding that models incorporating directed
edges to a global CLS node produced more intuitive attention maps, while also
yielding desirable classification performance. We analyzed the attention-based
explanations of the models, and their predictive performances to propose
optimal settings for the CGAT. The combination of local mean curvature and
distance to centroid as node features yielded a slight performance increase
with 0.76 weighted F1 score, and more comprehensive attention visualizations.
The CGAT architecture's ability to generate human-understandable attention maps
can enhance trust and facilitate expert validation of model decisions. While
demonstrated on dental data, CGAT is broadly applicable to graph-based
classification and regression tasks, promoting wider adoption of transparent
and competitive deep learning models in high-stakes environments.

Abstract: Temporal image forensics is the science of estimating the age of a digital
image. Usually, time-dependent traces (age traces) introduced by the image
acquisition pipeline are exploited for this purpose. In this review, a
comprehensive overview of the field of temporal image forensics based on
time-dependent traces from the image acquisition pipeline is given. This
includes a detailed insight into the properties of known age traces (i.e.,
in-field sensor defects and sensor dust) and temporal image forensics
techniques. Another key aspect of this work is to highlight the problem of
content bias and to illustrate how important eXplainable Artificial
Intelligence methods are to verify the reliability of temporal image forensics
techniques. Apart from reviewing material presented in previous works, in this
review: (i) a new (probably more realistic) forensic setting is proposed; (ii)
the main properties (growth rate and spatial distribution) of in-field sensor
defects are verified; (iii) it is shown that a method proposed to utilize
in-field sensor defects for image age approximation actually exploits other
traces (most likely content bias); (iv) the features learned by a neural
network dating palmprint images are further investigated; (v) it is shown how
easily a neural network can be distracted from learning age traces. For this
purpose, previous work is analyzed, re-implemented if required and experiments
are conducted.

TL;DR: 研究发现视觉语言基础模型中的性别偏见评估容易受到非性别特征（如物体和背景）的虚假相关性影响，即使微小扰动也会显著改变偏见分数，建议在报告偏见指标时同时报告特征敏感性测量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于真实世界图像的性别偏见评估基准往往包含性别与非性别特征之间的虚假相关性，这可能导致性别偏见评估的失真，需要研究这些虚假特征如何影响评估结果

Method: 系统性地扰动四个广泛使用的基准（COCO-gender、FACET、MIAP、PHASE）和各种VLMs中的非性别特征，量化它们对偏见评估的影响

Result: 即使最小扰动（如仅遮蔽10%的物体或轻微模糊背景）也能显著改变偏见分数，生成式VLMs的指标变化高达175%，CLIP变体变化达43%

Conclusion: 当前偏见评估往往反映模型对虚假特征而非性别偏见的响应，建议报告偏见指标时同时报告特征敏感性测量以提高评估可靠性

Abstract: Gender bias in vision-language foundation models (VLMs) raises concerns about
their safe deployment and is typically evaluated using benchmarks with gender
annotations on real-world images. However, as these benchmarks often contain
spurious correlations between gender and non-gender features, such as objects
and backgrounds, we identify a critical oversight in gender bias evaluation: Do
spurious features distort gender bias evaluation? To address this question, we
systematically perturb non-gender features across four widely used benchmarks
(COCO-gender, FACET, MIAP, and PHASE) and various VLMs to quantify their impact
on bias evaluation. Our findings reveal that even minimal perturbations, such
as masking just 10% of objects or weakly blurring backgrounds, can dramatically
alter bias scores, shifting metrics by up to 175% in generative VLMs and 43% in
CLIP variants. This suggests that current bias evaluations often reflect model
responses to spurious features rather than gender bias, undermining their
reliability. Since creating spurious feature-free benchmarks is fundamentally
challenging, we recommend reporting bias metrics alongside feature-sensitivity
measurements to enable a more reliable bias assessment.

Method: 提出两项关键创新：1）将结构化元数据转换为合成报告以丰富文本输入；2）添加预测小型精神状态检查（MMSE）分数的辅助标记，为微调提供额外监督。采用轻量级的图像和文本提示微调技术。

Result: 在两个阿尔茫海默病数据集上达到最先进性能，仅使用1,500张训练图像就超过了需要10,000张图像进行微调的现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法通过数据高效利用和轻量级微调，成功解决了医疗视觉-语言模型在元数据利用、临床知识整合和3D影像处理方面的挑战，为阿尔茫海默病诊断提供了高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Medical vision-language models (Med-VLMs) have shown impressive results in
tasks such as report generation and visual question answering, but they still
face several limitations. Most notably, they underutilize patient metadata and
lack integration of clinical diagnostic knowledge. Moreover, most existing
models are typically trained from scratch or fine-tuned on large-scale 2D
image-text pairs, requiring extensive computational resources, and their
effectiveness on 3D medical imaging is often limited due to the absence of
structural information. To address these gaps, we propose a data-efficient
fine-tuning pipeline to adapt 3D CT-based Med-VLMs for 3D MRI and demonstrate
its application in Alzheimer's disease (AD) diagnosis. Our system introduces
two key innovations. First, we convert structured metadata into synthetic
reports, enriching textual input for improved image-text alignment. Second, we
add an auxiliary token trained to predict the mini-mental state examination
(MMSE) score, a widely used clinical measure of cognitive function that
correlates with AD severity. This provides additional supervision for
fine-tuning. Applying lightweight prompt tuning to both image and text
modalities, our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on two AD
datasets using 1,500 training images, outperforming existing methods fine-tuned
on 10,000 images. Code will be released upon publication.

Motivation: 现有深度学习方法严重依赖大量标注数据，且学习到的表征缺乏可解释性，需要解决这两个挑战。

Method: 自监督交叉编码器框架，通过对比学习约束静态表征捕获稳定解剖特征，通过输入梯度正则化引导动态表征反映时间变化，可针对下游分类任务进行微调。

Result: 在ADNI数据集上实现优越分类准确性，学习到的表征在OASIS数据集上表现出强大的零样本泛化能力，在PPMI数据集上表现出跨任务泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅提高了神经退行性疾病诊断的准确性和可解释性，还展示了良好的泛化性能，代码将公开提供。

Abstract: Deep learning has shown significant potential in diagnosing neurodegenerative
diseases from MRI data. However, most existing methods rely heavily on large
volumes of labeled data and often yield representations that lack
interpretability. To address both challenges, we propose a novel
self-supervised cross-encoder framework that leverages the temporal continuity
in longitudinal MRI scans for supervision. This framework disentangles learned
representations into two components: a static representation, constrained by
contrastive learning, which captures stable anatomical features; and a dynamic
representation, guided by input-gradient regularization, which reflects
temporal changes and can be effectively fine-tuned for downstream
classification tasks. Experimental results on the Alzheimer's Disease
Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) dataset demonstrate that our method achieves
superior classification accuracy and improved interpretability. Furthermore,
the learned representations exhibit strong zero-shot generalization on the Open
Access Series of Imaging Studies (OASIS) dataset and cross-task generalization
on the Parkinson Progression Marker Initiative (PPMI) dataset. The code for the
proposed method will be made publicly available.

Motivation: 现有语义水印技术在潜在扩散模型中虽然能抵抗再生攻击，但由于频率完整性损失导致检测性能下降，需要解决这一根本问题。

Method: 提出Hermitian对称傅里叶水印(SFW)方法，通过强制Hermitian对称性保持频率完整性；采用中心感知嵌入策略确保裁剪攻击下的信息保留；将技术应用于现有语义水印方案以增强频域结构。

Result: 实验表明该方法在多种攻击场景下达到最先进的验证和识别性能，在保持优异图像保真度(FID和CLIP分数)的同时获得最高检测准确率。

Conclusion: SFW是平衡鲁棒性和图像保真度的有效框架，成功解决了语义水印中的固有权衡问题。

Abstract: Semantic watermarking techniques for latent diffusion models (LDMs) are
robust against regeneration attacks, but often suffer from detection
performance degradation due to the loss of frequency integrity. To tackle this
problem, we propose a novel embedding method called Hermitian Symmetric Fourier
Watermarking (SFW), which maintains frequency integrity by enforcing Hermitian
symmetry. Additionally, we introduce a center-aware embedding strategy that
reduces the vulnerability of semantic watermarking due to cropping attacks by
ensuring robust information retention. To validate our approach, we apply these
techniques to existing semantic watermarking schemes, enhancing their
frequency-domain structures for better robustness and retrieval accuracy.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our methods achieve state-of-the-art
verification and identification performance, surpassing previous approaches
across various attack scenarios. Ablation studies confirm the impact of SFW on
detection capabilities, the effectiveness of the center-aware embedding against
cropping, and how message capacity influences identification accuracy. Notably,
our method achieves the highest detection accuracy while maintaining superior
image fidelity, as evidenced by FID and CLIP scores. Conclusively, our proposed
SFW is shown to be an effective framework for balancing robustness and image
fidelity, addressing the inherent trade-offs in semantic watermarking. Code

Result: 在两个截然不同且具有挑战性的任务上实现最先进性能：多帧红外小目标检测和空间目标检测

Conclusion: 该方法证明了在不需要对目标特征做过多假设的情况下，通过建模背景低秩特性实现有效且通用的小目标检测

Abstract: Small moving target detection is crucial for many defense applications but
remains highly challenging due to low signal-to-noise ratios, ambiguous visual
cues, and cluttered backgrounds. In this work, we propose a novel deep learning
framework that differs fundamentally from existing approaches, which often rely
on target-specific features or motion cues and tend to lack robustness in
complex environments. Our key insight is that small target detection and
background discrimination are inherently coupled, even cluttered video
backgrounds often exhibit strong low-rank structures that can serve as stable
priors for detection. We reformulate the task as a tensor-based low-rank and
sparse decomposition problem and conduct a theoretical analysis of the
background, target, and noise components to guide model design. Building on
these insights, we introduce TenRPCANet, a deep neural network that requires
minimal assumptions about target characteristics. Specifically, we propose a
tokenization strategy that implicitly enforces multi-order tensor low-rank
priors through a self-attention mechanism. This mechanism captures both local
and non-local self-similarity to model the low-rank background without relying
on explicit iterative optimization. In addition, inspired by the sparse
component update in tensor RPCA, we design a feature refinement module to
enhance target saliency. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art
performance on two highly distinct and challenging tasks: multi-frame infrared
small target detection and space object detection. These results demonstrate
both the effectiveness and the generalizability of our approach.

Conclusion: 该方法在深度差异场景中表现优异，具有强泛化能力，在多个数据集上超越先前深度学习方法，实现了效率与精度的双重提升

Abstract: Previous deep image registration methods that employ single homography,
multi-grid homography, or thin-plate spline often struggle with real scenes
containing depth disparities due to their inherent limitations. To address
this, we propose an Exponential-Decay Free-Form Deformation Network (EDFFDNet),
which employs free-form deformation with an exponential-decay basis function.
This design achieves higher efficiency and performs well in scenes with depth
disparities, benefiting from its inherent locality. We also introduce an
Adaptive Sparse Motion Aggregator (ASMA), which replaces the MLP motion
aggregator used in previous methods. By transforming dense interactions into
sparse ones, ASMA reduces parameters and improves accuracy. Additionally, we
propose a progressive correlation refinement strategy that leverages
global-local correlation patterns for coarse-to-fine motion estimation, further
enhancing efficiency and accuracy. Experiments demonstrate that EDFFDNet
reduces parameters, memory, and total runtime by 70.5%, 32.6%, and 33.7%,
respectively, while achieving a 0.5 dB PSNR gain over the state-of-the-art
method. With an additional local refinement stage,EDFFDNet-2 further improves
PSNR by 1.06 dB while maintaining lower computational costs. Our method also
demonstrates strong generalization ability across datasets, outperforming
previous deep learning methods.

Abstract: Deep neural networks have exhibited impressive performance in image
classification tasks but remain vulnerable to adversarial examples. Standard
adversarial training enhances robustness but typically fails to explicitly
address inter-class feature overlap, a significant contributor to adversarial
susceptibility. In this work, we introduce a novel adversarial training
framework that actively mitigates inter-class proximity by projecting out
inter-class dependencies from adversarial and clean samples in the feature
space. Specifically, our approach first identifies the nearest inter-class
neighbors for each adversarial sample and subsequently removes projections onto
these neighbors to enforce stronger feature separability. Theoretically, we
demonstrate that our proposed logits correction reduces the Lipschitz constant
of neural networks, thereby lowering the Rademacher complexity, which directly
contributes to improved generalization and robustness. Extensive experiments
across standard benchmarks including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and SVHN show that
our method demonstrates strong performance that is competitive with leading
adversarial training techniques, highlighting significant achievements in both
robust and clean accuracy. Our findings reveal the importance of addressing
inter-class feature proximity explicitly to bolster adversarial robustness in
DNNs.

Motivation: 虽然短视频感知性能有显著提升，但在复杂理解和长视频任务上表现不佳，需要将现有感知能力应用于更复杂的视频推理

Method: 开发了一个基于大语言模型的代理系统，让其可以调用视频模块作为子代理或工具，并根据每次调用的结果决定后续步骤，同时使用评判器区分成功与失败的执行序列

Result: 在LVBench、Neptune和ActivityNet-RTL等数据集上取得了强劲的性能表现

Conclusion: 通过结合代理系统和评判器的方法，可以有效利用现有视频感知能力来处理更复杂的视频理解任务

Abstract: Video understanding has seen significant progress in recent years, with
models' performance on perception from short clips continuing to rise. Yet,
multiple recent benchmarks, such as LVBench, Neptune, and ActivityNet-RTL, show
performance wanes for tasks requiring complex reasoning on videos as queries
grow more complex and videos grow longer. In this work, we ask: can existing
perception capabilities be leveraged to successfully perform more complex video
reasoning? In particular, we develop a large language model agent given access
to video modules as subagents or tools. Rather than following a fixed procedure
to solve queries as in previous work such as Visual Programming, ViperGPT, and
MoReVQA, the agent uses the results of each call to a module to determine
subsequent steps. Inspired by work in the textual reasoning domain, we
introduce a critic to distinguish between instances of successful and
unsuccessful sequences from the agent. We show that the combination of our
agent and critic achieve strong performance on the previously-mentioned
datasets.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SEEC是一种基于语义分割的多熵模型无损图像压缩方法，通过为不同语义区域分配专用熵模型来提升压缩性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统学习方法使用单一熵模型估计整个图像的概率分布，无法捕捉不同语义区域的多样化统计特征

Method: 利用语义分割识别不同区域，为每个区域分配专用熵模型，使用多通道离散逻辑混合似然建模像素值分布

Result: 在基准数据集上达到最先进的压缩比，仅引入最小编码解码延迟，支持基于分割掩码的感兴趣区域编码

Conclusion: SEEC框架通过语义分割指导的多熵模型选择，显著提升了无损图像压缩性能

Abstract: Recently, learned image compression has attracted considerable attention due
to its superior performance over traditional methods. However, most existing
approaches employ a single entropy model to estimate the probability
distribution of pixel values across the entire image, which limits their
ability to capture the diverse statistical characteristics of different
semantic regions. To overcome this limitation, we propose Segmentation-Assisted
Multi-Entropy Models for Lossless Image Compression (SEEC). Our framework
utilizes semantic segmentation to guide the selection and adaptation of
multiple entropy models, enabling more accurate probability distribution
estimation for distinct semantic regions. Specifically, SEEC first extracts
image features and then applies semantic segmentation to identify different
regions, each assigned a specialized entropy model to better capture its unique
statistical properties. Finally, a multi-channel discrete logistic mixture
likelihood is employed to model the pixel value distributions effectively.
Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that SEEC achieves
state-of-the-art compression ratios while introducing only minimal encoding and
decoding latency. With superior performance, the proposed model also supports
Regions of Interest (ROIs) coding condition on the provided segmentation mask.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 脑梗是全球第二大死因，增复发率高且死亡率极高，需要早期识别高风险患者以进行适当治疗规划

Method: 收集3D脱内CTA图像数据和临床数据（心脏疾病、年龄、性别），训练单模态和多模态深度学习模型，进行二元分类和生存分析

Result: 多模态XSRD-net模型在测试集上达到c-index 0.68和AUC 0.71，发现心脏疾病和颈动脉存在关联性

Conclusion: 心脏疾病和颈动脉形态是预测脑梗增复的关键因素，多模态AI模型可以提高预测准确性

Abstract: Stroke is the second most frequent cause of death world wide with an annual
mortality of around 5.5 million. Recurrence rates of stroke are between 5 and
25% in the first year. As mortality rates for relapses are extraordinarily high
(40%) it is of utmost importance to reduce the recurrence rates. We address
this issue by detecting patients at risk of stroke recurrence at an early stage
in order to enable appropriate therapy planning. To this end we collected 3D
intracranial CTA image data and recorded concomitant heart diseases, the age
and the gender of stroke patients between 2010 and 2024. We trained single- and
multimodal deep learning based neural networks for binary relapse detection
(Task 1) and for relapse free survival (RFS) time prediction together with a
subsequent classification (Task 2). The separation of relapse from non-relapse
patients (Task 1) could be solved with tabular data (AUC on test dataset:
0.84). However, for the main task, the regression (Task 2), our multimodal
XSRD-net processed the modalities vision:tabular with 0.68:0.32 according to
modality contribution measures. The c-index with respect to relapses for the
multimodal model reached 0.68, and the AUC is 0.71 for the test dataset. Final,
deeper interpretability analysis results could highlight a link between both
heart diseases (tabular) and carotid arteries (vision) for the detection of
relapses and the prediction of the RFS time. This is a central outcome that we
strive to strengthen with ongoing data collection and model retraining.

Motivation: 虚拟现实和数字人建模中对高质量头发重建的需求日益增长，现有方法往往忽视发丝的连通性和拓扑结构

Method: 多阶段流水线：1) 使用可微分高斯光栅化器重建详细几何；2) 通过新颖的合并方案将高斯段合并为连贯发丝；3) 在光度监督下细化和生长发丝

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上验证了方法对多种发型的鲁棒性，重建通常在1小时内完成

Conclusion: 该方法能够高效重建具有正确拓扑结构的发丝级头发几何，为头发重建提供了新的解决方案

Abstract: Human hair reconstruction is a challenging problem in computer vision, with
growing importance for applications in virtual reality and digital human
modeling. Recent advances in 3D Gaussians Splatting (3DGS) provide efficient
and explicit scene representations that naturally align with the structure of
hair strands. In this work, we extend the 3DGS framework to enable strand-level
hair geometry reconstruction from multi-view images. Our multi-stage pipeline
first reconstructs detailed hair geometry using a differentiable Gaussian
rasterizer, then merges individual Gaussian segments into coherent strands
through a novel merging scheme, and finally refines and grows the strands under
photometric supervision.
  While existing methods typically evaluate reconstruction quality at the
geometric level, they often neglect the connectivity and topology of hair
strands. To address this, we propose a new evaluation metric that serves as a
proxy for assessing topological accuracy in strand reconstruction. Extensive
experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our
method robustly handles a wide range of hairstyles and achieves efficient
reconstruction, typically completing within one hour.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RayGaussX在RayGauss基础上进行优化，通过引入体积渲染加速策略、增强光线一致性、尺度正则化和新的致密化标准，实现了5-12倍训练加速和50-80倍渲染速度提升，同时PSNR质量提升0.56dB。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RayGauss虽然在合成和室内场景的新视角合成中达到了最先进的渲染质量，但其计算成本过高，无法在真实世界场景中实现实时渲染。

Method: 引入体积渲染加速策略（空域跳过和自适应采样）、增强光线一致性、尺度正则化减少误报交集、提出新的致密化标准改善远距离区域密度分布。

Result: 在真实世界数据集上实现5-12倍训练加速、50-80倍渲染速度提升（FPS），视觉质量PSNR提升最高达+0.56dB。

Conclusion: RayGaussX成功解决了RayGauss的计算效率问题，在保持高质量渲染的同时实现了显著的加速效果，适用于更大规模的场景。

Abstract: RayGauss has achieved state-of-the-art rendering quality for novel-view
synthesis on synthetic and indoor scenes by representing radiance and density
fields with irregularly distributed elliptical basis functions, rendered via
volume ray casting using a Bounding Volume Hierarchy (BVH). However, its
computational cost prevents real-time rendering on real-world scenes. Our
approach, RayGaussX, builds on RayGauss by introducing key contributions that
accelerate both training and inference. Specifically, we incorporate volumetric
rendering acceleration strategies such as empty-space skipping and adaptive
sampling, enhance ray coherence, and introduce scale regularization to reduce
false-positive intersections. Additionally, we propose a new densification
criterion that improves density distribution in distant regions, leading to
enhanced graphical quality on larger scenes. As a result, RayGaussX achieves 5x
to 12x faster training and 50x to 80x higher rendering speeds (FPS) on
real-world datasets while improving visual quality by up to +0.56 dB in PSNR.

Main category: cs.CV

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学MR成像中需要在扫描时间和图像质量之间取得平衡，传统方法分别分析低分辨率图像耗时且可能导致误判，需要一种能够融合多视角低分辨率图像的方法

Method: 使用自监督多视角神经网络，引入稀疏坐标损失函数来融合任意缩放比例的低分辨率图像，结合患者无关的离线阶段和患者特定的在线阶段

Result: 在两个独立队列的MR图像上验证，相比最先进的自监督超分辨率方法，在不同上采样尺度下获得相当或更好的性能，患者特定重建速度提升高达10倍

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效融合多视角低分辨率MR图像，在保证重建质量的同时显著提高处理速度，为医学图像分析提供了实用的解决方案

Abstract: Acquiring images in high resolution is often a challenging task. Especially
in the medical sector, image quality has to be balanced with acquisition time
and patient comfort. To strike a compromise between scan time and quality for
Magnetic Resonance (MR) imaging, two anisotropic scans with different
low-resolution (LR) orientations can be acquired. Typically, LR scans are
analyzed individually by radiologists, which is time consuming and can lead to
inaccurate interpretation. To tackle this, we propose a novel approach for
fusing two orthogonal anisotropic LR MR images to reconstruct anatomical
details in a unified representation. Our multi-view neural network is trained
in a self-supervised manner, without requiring corresponding high-resolution
(HR) data. To optimize the model, we introduce a sparse coordinate-based loss,
enabling the integration of LR images with arbitrary scaling. We evaluate our
method on MR images from two independent cohorts. Our results demonstrate
comparable or even improved super-resolution (SR) performance compared to
state-of-the-art (SOTA) self-supervised SR methods for different upsampling
scales. By combining a patient-agnostic offline and a patient-specific online
phase, we achieve a substantial speed-up of up to ten times for
patient-specific reconstruction while achieving similar or better SR quality.

TL;DR: SplatFill是一种基于深度引导的3D高斯溅射场景修复方法，通过联合深度监督和一致性感知优化，实现了最先进的感知质量和效率提升


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D高斯溅射(3DGS)虽然能够从多视角图像创建高度逼真的3D场景表示，但在修复由于遮挡或场景编辑导致的缺失区域时仍存在挑战，常常导致模糊细节、伪影和几何不一致

Method: 结合两个关键思想：(1)联合深度监督和基于对象的监督，确保修复的高斯点在3D空间中准确定位并与周围几何对齐；(2)提出一致性感知细化方案，选择性识别和修正不一致区域而不破坏场景其他部分

Result: 在SPIn-NeRF数据集上的评估显示，SplatFill不仅在视觉保真度上超越了现有的基于NeRF和3DGS的修复方法，还将训练时间减少了24.5%。定性结果显示该方法能提供更清晰的细节、更少的伪影，并在具有挑战性的视角下保持更好的连贯性

Conclusion: SplatFill通过深度引导和一致性优化，成功解决了3DGS场景修复中的关键问题，实现了高质量和高效率的场景修复

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has enabled the creation of highly realistic 3D
scene representations from sets of multi-view images. However, inpainting
missing regions, whether due to occlusion or scene editing, remains a
challenging task, often leading to blurry details, artifacts, and inconsistent
geometry. In this work, we introduce SplatFill, a novel depth-guided approach
for 3DGS scene inpainting that achieves state-of-the-art perceptual quality and
improved efficiency. Our method combines two key ideas: (1) joint depth-based
and object-based supervision to ensure inpainted Gaussians are accurately
placed in 3D space and aligned with surrounding geometry, and (2) we propose a
consistency-aware refinement scheme that selectively identifies and corrects
inconsistent regions without disrupting the rest of the scene. Evaluations on
the SPIn-NeRF dataset demonstrate that SplatFill not only surpasses existing
NeRF-based and 3DGS-based inpainting methods in visual fidelity but also
reduces training time by 24.5%. Qualitative results show our method delivers
sharper details, fewer artifacts, and greater coherence across challenging
viewpoints.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM的3D对象分割方法存在表示不对齐问题：LLM处理高级语义标记，而3D点云只包含密集几何结构，导致输入输出阶段的限制和精度损失

Method: 提出Point Linguist Model (PLM)框架，包含Object-centric Discriminative Representation (OcDR)学习对象中心标记，以及Geometric Reactivation Decoder (GRD)结合OcDR标记和密集特征进行精确分割

Result: 在ScanNetv2上提升+7.3 mIoU，在Multi3DRefer上提升+6.0 mIoU，在7个基准测试的4个不同任务中均取得一致性能提升

Conclusion: PLM通过全面的对象中心推理有效解决了3D表示对齐问题，为稳健的3D理解提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: 3D object segmentation with Large Language Models (LLMs) has become a
prevailing paradigm due to its broad semantics, task flexibility, and strong
generalization. However, this paradigm is hindered by representation
misalignment: LLMs process high-level semantic tokens, whereas 3D point clouds
convey only dense geometric structures. In prior methods, misalignment limits
both input and output. At the input stage, dense point patches require heavy
pre-alignment, weakening object-level semantics and confusing similar
distractors. At the output stage, predictions depend only on dense features
without explicit geometric cues, leading to a loss of fine-grained accuracy. To
address these limitations, we present the Point Linguist Model (PLM), a general
framework that bridges the representation gap between LLMs and dense 3D point
clouds without requiring large-scale pre-alignment between 3D-text or
3D-images. Specifically, we introduce Object-centric Discriminative
Representation (OcDR), which learns object-centric tokens that capture target
semantics and scene relations under a hard negative-aware training objective.
This mitigates the misalignment between LLM tokens and 3D points, enhances
resilience to distractors, and facilitates semantic-level reasoning within
LLMs. For accurate segmentation, we introduce the Geometric Reactivation
Decoder (GRD), which predicts masks by combining OcDR tokens carrying
LLM-inferred geometry with corresponding dense features, preserving
comprehensive dense features throughout the pipeline. Extensive experiments
show that PLM achieves significant improvements of +7.3 mIoU on ScanNetv2 and
+6.0 mIoU on Multi3DRefer for 3D referring segmentation, with consistent gains
across 7 benchmarks spanning 4 different tasks, demonstrating the effectiveness
of comprehensive object-centric reasoning for robust 3D understanding.

Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在图像描述和视觉问答任务中表现优异，但容易产生与视觉输入冲突的幻觉。现有方法通常对所有层和注意力头进行统一调整，无法准确定位错误来源。

Method: 提出Layer Image Attention Entropy (LIAE)诊断异常层，Image Attention Focus (IAF)评分注意力头。基于这些信号开发Dynamic Layer-wise Entropy and Attention Fusion (D-LEAF)，在推理过程中动态定位和修正错误。

Result: 在标准图像描述基准上实现53%的相对改进，VQA任务的准确率和F1分数均提升约4%，显著抑制幻觉同时保持效率。

Conclusion: LIAE和IAF能有效定位问题层和注意力头，D-LEAF方法以可忽略的开销动态修正幻觉，为MLLM的可靠性提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) achieve strong performance on tasks
like image captioning and visual question answering, but remain prone to
hallucinations, where generated text conflicts with the visual input. Prior
work links this partly to insufficient visual attention, but existing
attention-based detectors and mitigation typically apply uniform adjustments
across layers and heads, obscuring where errors originate. In this paper, we
first show these methods fail to accurately localize problematic layers. Then,
we introduce two diagnostics: Layer Image Attention Entropy (LIAE) which flags
anomalous layers, and Image Attention Focus (IAF) which scores attention heads
within those layers. Analysis shows that LIAE pinpoints faulty layers and IAF
reliably ranks heads that warrant correction. Guided by these signals, we
propose Dynamic Layer-wise Entropy and Attention Fusion (D-LEAF), a
task-agnostic, attention-guided method that dynamically localizes and corrects
errors during inference with negligible overhead. Results show our D-LEAF
delivers a 53% relative improvement on standard captioning benchmarks, and on
VQA both accuracy and F1-score improve by approximately 4%, substantially
suppressing hallucinations while preserving efficiency.

Abstract: Active Membership Inference Test (aMINT) is a method designed to detect
whether given data were used during the training of machine learning models. In
Active MINT, we propose a novel multitask learning process that involves
training simultaneously two models: the original or Audited Model, and a
secondary model, referred to as the MINT Model, responsible for identifying the
data used for training the Audited Model. This novel multi-task learning
approach has been designed to incorporate the auditability of the model as an
optimization objective during the training process of neural networks. The
proposed approach incorporates intermediate activation maps as inputs to the
MINT layers, which are trained to enhance the detection of training data. We
present results using a wide range of neural networks, from lighter
architectures such as MobileNet to more complex ones such as Vision
Transformers, evaluated in 5 public benchmarks. Our proposed Active MINT
achieves over 80% accuracy in detecting if given data was used for training,
significantly outperforming previous approaches in the literature. Our aMINT
and related methodological developments contribute to increasing transparency
in AI models, facilitating stronger safeguards in AI deployments to achieve
proper security, privacy, and copyright protection.

Motivation: 现有方法在支持目标对象与整个查询图像之间建立图像级相关性，但这种相关性包含难以追踪和抑制的硬像素噪声（无关背景对象），导致背景过拟合

Method: 设计对象级相关网络（OCNet），包含通用对象挖掘模块（GOMM）和相关构建模块（CCM）。GOMM通过学习显著性和高层相似性线索构建查询通用对象特征，CCM通过分配目标原型来匹配通用对象特征建立对象级相关性

Conclusion: 通过模仿生物视觉过程建立对象级相关性，能够有效挖掘查询目标特征并抑制硬像素噪声，在少样本语义分割任务中表现出色

Abstract: Few-shot semantic segmentation (FSS) aims to segment objects of novel
categories in the query images given only a few annotated support samples.
Existing methods primarily build the image-level correlation between the
support target object and the entire query image. However, this correlation
contains the hard pixel noise, \textit{i.e.}, irrelevant background objects,
that is intractable to trace and suppress, leading to the overfitting of the
background. To address the limitation of this correlation, we imitate the
biological vision process to identify novel objects in the object-level
information. Target identification in the general objects is more valid than in
the entire image, especially in the low-data regime. Inspired by this, we
design an Object-level Correlation Network (OCNet) by establishing the
object-level correlation between the support target object and query general
objects, which is mainly composed of the General Object Mining Module (GOMM)
and Correlation Construction Module (CCM). Specifically, GOMM constructs the
query general object feature by learning saliency and high-level similarity
cues, where the general objects include the irrelevant background objects and
the target foreground object. Then, CCM establishes the object-level
correlation by allocating the target prototypes to match the general object
feature. The generated object-level correlation can mine the query target
feature and suppress the hard pixel noise for the final prediction. Extensive
experiments on PASCAL-${5}^{i}$ and COCO-${20}^{i}$ show that our model
achieves the state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Joint reconstruction of human-object interaction marks a significant
milestone in comprehending the intricate interrelations between humans and
their surrounding environment. Nevertheless, previous optimization methods
often struggle to achieve physically plausible reconstruction results due to
the lack of prior knowledge about human-object interactions. In this paper, we
introduce ScoreHOI, an effective diffusion-based optimizer that introduces
diffusion priors for the precise recovery of human-object interactions. By
harnessing the controllability within score-guided sampling, the diffusion
model can reconstruct a conditional distribution of human and object pose given
the image observation and object feature. During inference, the ScoreHOI
effectively improves the reconstruction results by guiding the denoising
process with specific physical constraints. Furthermore, we propose a
contact-driven iterative refinement approach to enhance the contact
plausibility and improve the reconstruction accuracy. Extensive evaluations on
standard benchmarks demonstrate ScoreHOI's superior performance over
state-of-the-art methods, highlighting its ability to achieve a precise and
robust improvement in joint human-object interaction reconstruction.

Abstract: Digital dentistry represents a transformative shift in modern dental
practice. The foundational step in this transformation is the accurate digital
representation of the patient's dentition, which is obtained from segmented
Cone-Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) and Intraoral Scans (IOS). Despite the
growing interest in digital dental technologies, existing segmentation
methodologies frequently lack rigorous validation and demonstrate limited
performance and clinical applicability. To the best of our knowledge, this is
the first work to introduce a multimodal pretraining framework for tooth
segmentation. We present ToothMCL, a Tooth Multimodal Contrastive Learning for
pretraining that integrates volumetric (CBCT) and surface-based (IOS)
modalities. By capturing modality-invariant representations through multimodal
contrastive learning, our approach effectively models fine-grained anatomical
features, enabling precise multi-class segmentation and accurate identification
of F\'ed\'eration Dentaire Internationale (FDI) tooth numbering. Along with the
framework, we curated CBCT-IOS3.8K, the largest paired CBCT and IOS dataset to
date, comprising 3,867 patients. We then evaluated ToothMCL on a comprehensive
collection of independent datasets, representing the largest and most diverse
evaluation to date. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in both
internal and external testing, with an increase of 12\% for CBCT segmentation
and 8\% for IOS segmentation in the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC).
Furthermore, ToothMCL consistently surpasses existing approaches in tooth
groups and demonstrates robust generalizability across varying imaging
conditions and clinical scenarios.

TL;DR: 通过两次通道适应性推理算法解决消费级硬件上对象检测的系统级性能瓶颈，在COCO数据集上实现1.85倍速度提升，mAP损失仅5.51%


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前本地AI模型在消费级硬件上的实际性能与基准测试存在显著差距，性能受到系统级瓶颈限制而非计算能力限制

Method: 提出两次通道适应性推理算法，先使用快速低分辨率通道，仅在检测信心度低时才升级到高分辨率模型通道，无需模型架构改动

Result: 在5000张COCO图片上，方法实现了1.85倍的速度提升（相比PyTorch Early-Exit基准），mAP损失仅5.51%

Conclusion: 通过从纯粹模型优化转向硬件感知的推理策略，为消费级设备部署高性能实时AI提供了可实现的解决方案

Abstract: As local AI grows in popularity, there is a critical gap between the
benchmark performance of object detectors and their practical viability on
consumer-grade hardware. While models like YOLOv10s promise real-time speeds,
these metrics are typically achieved on high-power, desktop-class GPUs. This
paper reveals that on resource-constrained systems, such as laptops with RTX
4060 GPUs, performance is not compute-bound but is instead dominated by
system-level bottlenecks, as illustrated by a simple bottleneck test. To
overcome this hardware-level constraint, we introduce a Two-Pass Adaptive
Inference algorithm, a model-independent approach that requires no
architectural changes. This study mainly focuses on adaptive inference
strategies and undertakes a comparative analysis of architectural early-exit
and resolution-adaptive routing, highlighting their respective trade-offs
within a unified evaluation framework. The system uses a fast, low-resolution
pass and only escalates to a high-resolution model pass when detection
confidence is low. On a 5000-image COCO dataset, our method achieves a 1.85x
speedup over a PyTorch Early-Exit baseline, with a modest mAP loss of 5.51%.
This work provides a practical and reproducible blueprint for deploying
high-performance, real-time AI on consumer-grade devices by shifting the focus
from pure model optimization to hardware-aware inference strategies that
maximize throughput.

Motivation: 为了满足轨道服务和活急废弃物清除任务的需求，需要准确重建围绕运动的非合作空间物体的几何形状和运动特性。

Method: 使用Isaac Sim模拟环境生成物理准确的2D图像序列，并采用Neuralangelo等现有状态下的最优3D重建算法进行性能评估。

Conclusion: 研究为动态场景重建提供了基准，表明现有算法在静态场景中已取得成功，为后续动态场景重建评估奠定了基础。

Abstract: Characterization of uncooperative Resident Space Objects (RSO) play a crucial
role in On-Orbit Servicing (OOS) and Active Debris Removal (ADR) missions to
assess the geometry and motion properties. To address the challenges of
reconstructing tumbling uncooperative targets, this study evaluates the
performance of existing state-of-the-art 3D reconstruction algorithms for
dynamic scenes, focusing on their ability to generate geometrically accurate
models with high-fidelity. To support our evaluation, we developed a simulation
environment using Isaac Sim to generate physics-accurate 2D image sequences of
tumbling satellite under realistic orbital lighting conditions. Our preliminary
results on static scenes using Neuralangelo demonstrate promising
reconstruction quality. The generated 3D meshes closely match the original CAD
models with minimal errors and artifacts when compared using Cloud Compare
(CC). The reconstructed models were able to capture critical fine details for
mission planning. This provides a baseline for our ongoing evaluation of
dynamic scene reconstruction.

Motivation: 解决深度神经网络内部特征提取过程的黑盒性质，通过生成特定特征图像来理解DNN编码的图像属性

Method: 使用引导扩散模型，在预训练扩散模型的反向图像生成过程中最小化生成图像特征与目标特征的欧氏距离

Result: 实验针对CLIP图像编码器、ResNet-50和视觉变换器，生成图像的特征与目标特征高度相似，揭示了DNN特征空间的有价值见解

Conclusion: 该方法无需额外训练即可分析不同DNN的特征空间，在单个商用GPU上运行，为理解神经网络内部表示提供了有效工具

Abstract: One of the key issues in Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) is the black-box nature
of their internal feature extraction process. Targeting vision-related domains,
this paper focuses on analysing the feature space of a DNN by proposing a
decoder that can generate images whose features are guaranteed to closely match
a user-specified feature. Owing to this guarantee that is missed in past
studies, our decoder allows us to evidence which of various attributes in an
image are encoded into a feature by the DNN, by generating images whose
features are in proximity to that feature. Our decoder is implemented as a
guided diffusion model that guides the reverse image generation of a
pre-trained diffusion model to minimise the Euclidean distance between the
feature of a clean image estimated at each step and the user-specified feature.
One practical advantage of our decoder is that it can analyse feature spaces of
different DNNs with no additional training and run on a single COTS GPU. The
experimental results targeting CLIP's image encoder, ResNet-50 and vision
transformer demonstrate that images generated by our decoder have features
remarkably similar to the user-specified ones and reveal valuable insights into
these DNNs' feature spaces.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Visual-TableQA是一个大规模开放域多模态数据集，专门用于评估和增强视觉语言模型在复杂表格数据上的视觉推理能力，包含2.5k个LaTeX渲染表格和6k个推理密集型QA对。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基准测试在规模、多样性和推理深度方面存在局限，特别是在渲染表格图像方面，需要填补这一空白。

Method: 采用模块化、可扩展的全自动生成流水线，多个推理LLM在生成、验证和启发等不同角色上协作，通过跨模型提示和LLM陪审团过滤实现多模型协作数据生成。

Result: 在Visual-TableQA上微调的模型能够稳健地泛化到外部基准测试，优于多个专有模型，尽管数据集是合成的。

Conclusion: Visual-TableQA为视觉表格推理提供了有效的评估和增强工具，展示了合成数据生成方法的有效性，相关资源已公开提供。

Abstract: Visual reasoning over structured data such as tables is a critical capability
for modern vision-language models (VLMs), yet current benchmarks remain limited
in scale, diversity, or reasoning depth, especially when it comes to rendered
table images. Addressing this gap, we introduce Visual-TableQA, a large-scale,
open-domain multimodal dataset specifically designed to evaluate and enhance
visual reasoning over complex tabular data. Our generation pipeline is modular,
scalable, and fully autonomous, involving multiple reasoning LLMs collaborating
across distinct roles: generation, validation, and inspiration. Visual-TableQA
comprises 2.5k richly structured LaTeX-rendered tables and 6k
reasoning-intensive QA pairs, all produced at a cost of under USD 100. To
promote diversity and creativity, our pipeline performs multi-model
collaborative data generation via cross-model prompting ('inspiration') and
LLM-jury filtering. Stronger models seed layouts and topics that weaker models
elaborate, collectively distilling diverse reasoning patterns and visual
structures into the dataset. Empirical results show that models fine-tuned on
Visual-TableQA generalize robustly to external benchmarks, outperforming
several proprietary models despite the dataset's synthetic nature. The full

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Mini-o3是一个多模态模型系统，通过大规模工具交互和深度多轮推理（可达数十步）来解决复杂视觉搜索任务，在有限交互轮次训练下实现推理时的可扩展性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有开源多模态模型存在推理模式单调、交互轮次有限的问题，无法处理需要试错探索的困难视觉任务。

Method: 构建Visual Probe数据集、开发迭代数据收集管道获取多样化推理轨迹、提出over-turn masking策略防止强化学习中惩罚超轮次响应。

Result: 模型在仅6轮交互训练的情况下，推理时可自然扩展到数十轮，准确率随轮次增加而提升，在挑战性视觉搜索任务上达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: Mini-o3能够产生丰富的推理模式和深度思考路径，有效解决复杂视觉搜索问题，展示了大规模工具交互和深度多轮推理的重要性。

Abstract: Recent advances in large multimodal models have leveraged image-based tools
with reinforcement learning to tackle visual problems. However, existing
open-source approaches often exhibit monotonous reasoning patterns and allow
only a limited number of interaction turns, making them inadequate for
difficult tasks that require trial-and-error exploration. In this work, we
address this limitation by scaling up tool-based interactions and introduce
Mini-o3, a system that executes deep, multi-turn reasoning -- spanning tens of
steps -- and achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging visual search
tasks. Our recipe for reproducing OpenAI o3-style behaviors comprises three key
components. First, we construct the Visual Probe Dataset, a collection of
thousands of challenging visual search problems designed for exploratory
reasoning. Second, we develop an iterative data collection pipeline to obtain
cold-start trajectories that exhibit diverse reasoning patterns, including
depth-first search, trial-and-error, and goal maintenance. Third, we propose an
over-turn masking strategy that prevents penalization of over-turn responses
(those that hit the maximum number of turns) during reinforcement learning,
thereby balancing training-time efficiency with test-time scalability. Despite
training with an upper bound of only six interaction turns, our model generates
trajectories that naturally scale to tens of turns at inference time, with
accuracy improving as the number of turns increases. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that Mini-o3 produces rich reasoning patterns and deep thinking
paths, effectively solving challenging visual search problems.

TL;DR: OnePoseViaGen是一个用于单张参考图像6D姿态估计的先进方法，通过粗到精对齐模块和文本引导生成域随机化策略，在多个基准测试中达到最先进性能，并成功应用于真实机器人抓取任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现实世界中任意未见物体的6D姿态估计问题，特别是在3D模型稀缺、单视图重建缺乏度量尺度、生成模型与真实图像存在域差距等挑战下，需要开发更鲁棒的姿态估计方法。

Method: 提出两阶段方法：1）粗到精对齐模块，结合多视图特征匹配和渲染比较细化来联合优化尺度和姿态；2）文本引导生成域随机化策略，通过多样化纹理实现合成数据上的有效微调。

Result: 在YCBInEOAT、Toyota-Light、LM-O等挑战性基准测试中达到最先进性能，远超先前方法，并在真实机器人手上展示了鲁棒的灵巧抓取能力。

Conclusion: OnePoseViaGen通过高保真单视图3D生成支持可靠的单次6D姿态估计，验证了该方法在现实世界操作中的实用性，为机器人长尾实例操作提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Estimating the 6D pose of arbitrary unseen objects from a single reference
image is critical for robotics operating in the long-tail of real-world
instances. However, this setting is notoriously challenging: 3D models are
rarely available, single-view reconstructions lack metric scale, and domain
gaps between generated models and real-world images undermine robustness. We
propose OnePoseViaGen, a pipeline that tackles these challenges through two key
components. First, a coarse-to-fine alignment module jointly refines scale and
pose by combining multi-view feature matching with render-and-compare
refinement. Second, a text-guided generative domain randomization strategy
diversifies textures, enabling effective fine-tuning of pose estimators with
synthetic data. Together, these steps allow high-fidelity single-view 3D
generation to support reliable one-shot 6D pose estimation. On challenging
benchmarks (YCBInEOAT, Toyota-Light, LM-O), OnePoseViaGen achieves
state-of-the-art performance far surpassing prior approaches. We further
demonstrate robust dexterous grasping with a real robot hand, validating the
practicality of our method in real-world manipulation. Project page:

TL;DR: VIRAL是一种视觉表示对齐方法，通过将MLLMs的内部视觉表示与预训练视觉基础模型对齐，来增强多模态大语言模型在视觉中心任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态大语言模型在文本监督下训练，导致视觉细节丢失，在物体计数和空间推理等视觉中心任务上表现受限。

Method: 提出VIRAL正则化策略，显式对齐MLLMs与预训练视觉基础模型的内部视觉表示，保留关键视觉细节并补充额外视觉知识。

Result: 在广泛采用的多模态基准测试中，所有任务都获得了持续改进，验证了框架的关键设计选择。

Conclusion: 这一简单发现为在MLLMs训练中有效整合视觉信息开辟了重要方向。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) trained with visual instruction
tuning have achieved strong performance across diverse tasks, yet they remain
limited in vision-centric tasks such as object counting or spatial reasoning.
We attribute this gap to the prevailing text-only supervision paradigm, which
provides only indirect guidance for the visual pathway and often leads MLLMs to
discard fine-grained visual details during training. In this paper, we present
VIsual Representation ALignment (VIRAL), a simple yet effective regularization
strategy that aligns the internal visual representations of MLLMs with those of
pre-trained vision foundation models (VFMs). By explicitly enforcing this
alignment, VIRAL enables the model not only to retain critical visual details
from the input vision encoder but also to complement additional visual
knowledge from VFMs, thereby enhancing its ability to reason over complex
visual inputs. Our experiments demonstrate consistent improvements across all
tasks on widely adopted multimodal benchmarks. Furthermore, we conduct
comprehensive ablation studies to validate the key design choices underlying
our framework. We believe this simple finding opens up an important direction
for the effective integration of visual information in training MLLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 睡眠质量对健康致关重要，医疗服务提供者和个人需要可访问、可靠的预测工具来进行预防性干预。目前需要能够处理商用可穿戴设备稀疏数据的个性化预测方案。

Method: 提出了一种可解释的两阶段适配性空间-时间模型。模型结构包括：1）多尺度卷积层模型多种输入变量间的空间相互作用；2）递归层和注意力机制捕获长期时间依赖关系；3）两阶段域适配策略（训练阶段减少过拟合，测试时源无需标签的适配机制）。

Result: 在5种不同输入窗口大小（3,5,7,9,11天）和5种预测窗口大小（1,3,5,7,9天）的实验中，模型都超过了LSTM、Informer、PatchTST、TimesNet等基线方法。最佳性能在3天输入窗口和1天预测窗口时达到RMSE 0.216，甚至在更长预测期限下也保持良好性能（3天预测窗口RMSE为0.257）。解释性分析证明了不同特征对睡眠质量的影响。

Conclusion: 该框架为使用商用可穿戴设备的稀疏数据进行个性化睡眠预测提供了一种健壮、适应性强且可解释的解决方案，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Sleep quality significantly impacts well-being. Therefore, healthcare
providers and individuals need accessible and reliable forecasting tools for
preventive interventions. This paper introduces an interpretable,
individualized two-stage adaptive spatial-temporal model for predicting sleep
quality scores. Our proposed framework combines multi-scale convolutional
layers to model spatial interactions across multiple input variables, recurrent
layers and attention mechanisms to capture long-term temporal dependencies, and
a two-stage domain adaptation strategy to enhance generalization. The first
adaptation stage is applied during training to mitigate overfitting on the
training set. In the second stage, a source-free test-time adaptation mechanism
is employed to adapt the model to new users without requiring labels. We
conducted various experiments with five input window sizes (3, 5, 7, 9, and 11
days) and five prediction window sizes (1, 3, 5, 7, and 9 days). Our model
consistently outperformed time series forecasting baseline approaches,
including Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Informer, PatchTST, and TimesNet. The
best performance was achieved with a three-day input window and a one-day
prediction window, yielding a root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.216.
Furthermore, the model demonstrated good predictive performance even for longer
forecasting horizons (e.g, with a 0.257 RMSE for a three-day prediction
window), highlighting its practical utility for real-world applications. We
also conducted an explainability analysis to examine how different features
influence sleep quality. These findings proved that the proposed framework
offers a robust, adaptive, and explainable solution for personalized sleep
forecasting using sparse data from commercial wearable devices.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图自监督学习方法主要在单一数据集上开发和评估，缺乏对跨数据集迁移性的系统研究，限制了知识迁移和大规模预训练的能力，这是发展超越训练数据拟合的通用智能的关键因素。

Method: 在ogbn-papers100M上进行大规模预训练，评估5种代表性SSL方法在多样化目标图上的表现，通过标准化实验设置分离模型架构、数据集特征和适应协议等混杂因素，专注于预训练目标的比较。

Result: 大多数图SSL方法难以泛化，有些甚至比随机初始化表现更差。相比之下，掩码自编码器方法GraphMAE能持续提升迁移性能。

Conclusion: 研究分析了驱动这些差异的底层因素，为可迁移图SSL的未来研究提供指导，为图学习中的"预训练-后迁移"范式奠定坚实基础。

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has shown great promise in graph
representation learning. However, most existing graph SSL methods are developed
and evaluated under a single-dataset setting, leaving their cross-dataset
transferability largely unexplored and limiting their ability to leverage
knowledge transfer and large-scale pretraining, factors that are critical for
developing generalized intelligence beyond fitting training data. To address
this gap and advance foundation model research for graphs, we present GSTBench,
the first systematic benchmark for evaluating the transferability of graph SSL
methods. We conduct large-scale pretraining on ogbn-papers100M and evaluate
five representative SSL methods across a diverse set of target graphs. Our
standardized experimental setup decouples confounding factors such as model
architecture, dataset characteristics, and adaptation protocols, enabling
rigorous comparisons focused solely on pretraining objectives. Surprisingly, we
observe that most graph SSL methods struggle to generalize, with some
performing worse than random initialization. In contrast, GraphMAE, a masked
autoencoder approach, consistently improves transfer performance. We analyze
the underlying factors that drive these differences and offer insights to guide
future research on transferable graph SSL, laying a solid foundation for the
"pretrain-then-transfer" paradigm in graph learning. Our code is available at

Conclusion: 通过整合结构化交通数据和人类知识文本数据，KGCM模型有效提升了交通需求预测的准确性和鲁棒性，证明了人类知识经验在交通预测中的重要性。

Abstract: Traffic demand prediction plays a critical role in intelligent transportation
systems. Existing traffic prediction models primarily rely on temporal traffic
data, with limited efforts incorporating human knowledge and experience for
urban traffic demand forecasting. However, in real-world scenarios, traffic
knowledge and experience derived from human daily life significantly influence
precise traffic prediction. Such knowledge and experiences can guide the model
in uncovering latent patterns within traffic data, thereby enhancing the
accuracy and robustness of predictions. To this end, this paper proposes
integrating structured temporal traffic data with textual data representing
human knowledge and experience, resulting in a novel knowledge-guided
cross-modal feature representation learning (KGCM) model for traffic demand
prediction. Based on regional transportation characteristics, we construct a
prior knowledge dataset using a large language model combined with manual
authoring and revision, covering both regional and global knowledge and
experiences. The KGCM model then learns multimodal data features through
designed local and global adaptive graph networks, as well as a cross-modal
feature fusion mechanism. A proposed reasoning-based dynamic update strategy
enables dynamic optimization of the graph model's parameters, achieving optimal
performance. Experiments on multiple traffic datasets demonstrate that our
model accurately predicts future traffic demand and outperforms existing
state-of-the-art (SOTA) models.

Motivation: 解决深度学习系统在不同计算后端（CPU、GPU、编译运行时）部署时出现的跨后端偏差问题，提供系统化的评估和缓解方法。

Method: 使用YAML配置文件解耦实验与代码，支持库和仓库模型，采用三层验证协议：张量级接近度、激活对齐和任务级指标，进行672次测试验证。

Result: 72.0%的运行通过测试，大多数偏差出现在更严格的容差阈值下；检测模型和编译后端更容易出现偏差，主要原因是非决定性后处理；决定性适配器和选择性回退能够显著提高一致性而不丢失性能。

Conclusion: 该框架是首个统一的系统化方法，能够量化和缓解深度学习中的跨后端偏差，为异构运行时环境下的可靠部署提供了可复现的方法论。

Abstract: This paper presents a configuration-first framework for evaluating
cross-backend compatibility in deep learning systems deployed on CPU, GPU, and
compiled runtimes. The framework decouples experiments from code using YAML,
supports both library and repository models, and employs a three-tier
verification protocol covering tensor-level closeness, activation alignment,
and task-level metrics. Through 672 checks across multiple models and tolerance
settings, we observe that 72.0% of runs pass, with most discrepancies occurring
under stricter thresholds. Our results show that detection models and compiled
backends are particularly prone to drift, often due to nondeterministic
post-processing. We further demonstrate that deterministic adapters and
selective fallbacks can substantially improve agreement without significant
performance loss. To our knowledge, this is the first unified framework that
systematically quantifies and mitigates cross-backend drift in deep learning,
providing a reproducible methodology for dependable deployment across
heterogeneous runtimes.

Conclusion: 所提出的Kriging-HDMR主动学习方法能有效处理高维可靠性分析问题，在计算效率和预测精度方面都表现出色，为高维可靠性工程问题提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: In reliability engineering, conventional surrogate models encounter the
"curse of dimensionality" as the number of random variables increases. While
the active learning Kriging surrogate approaches with high-dimensional model
representation (HDMR) enable effective approximation of high-dimensional
functions and are widely applied to optimization problems, there are rare
studies specifically focused on reliability analysis, which prioritizes
prediction accuracy in critical regions over uniform accuracy across the entire
domain. This study develops an active learning surrogate model method based on
the Kriging-HDMR modeling for reliability analysis. The proposed approach
facilitates the approximation of high-dimensional limit state functions through
a composite representation constructed from multiple low-dimensional
sub-surrogate models. The architecture of the surrogate modeling framework
comprises three distinct stages: developing single-variable sub-surrogate
models for all random variables, identifying the requirements for
coupling-variable sub-surrogate models, and constructing the coupling-variable
sub-surrogate models. Optimization mathematical models for selection of design
of experiment samples are formulated based on each stage's characteristics,
with objectives incorporating uncertainty variance, predicted mean, sample
location and inter-sample distances. A candidate sample pool-free approach is
adopted to achieve the selection of informative samples. Numerical experiments
demonstrate that the proposed method achieves high computational efficiency
while maintaining strong predictive accuracy in solving high-dimensional
reliability problems.

will degrade the model performance due to the variation in variables' joint
distribution along the temporal direction. Previous studies mainly applied
normalization to eliminate the non-stationarity in time series, thereby
achieving better predictability. However, the normalization may obscure useful
characteristics inherent in non-stationarity, which is known as the
over-stationarization. In this work, to trade off predictability and
non-stationarity, a new approach for multi-step ATP, named non-stationary ATP (
NSATP), is proposed. The method consists of two stages: series stationarization
and non-stationarity effect recovery. The first stage aims at improving the
predictability. As for the latter, NSATP extends a state-of-the-art method from
one-dimensional to two dimensional based models to capture the hidden
periodicity in time series and designs a compensation module of
over-stationarization by learning scaling and shifting factors from raw data.
125 days' public transport operational data of Dresden is collected for
validation. Experimental results show that compared to baseline methods, the
proposed NSATP can reduce RMSE, MAE, and MAPE by 2.37%, 1.22%, and 2.26% for
trams and by 1.72%, 0.60%, and 1.17% for buses, respectively.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在基础推理方面表现出色，但在需要与外部工具交互的任务中表现不佳，需要解决多轮工具使用的挑战

Method: 采用异步调用器、解耦工具/训练架构、奖励层支持多种评估信号，重构MDP引入观察标记，实现生成-解析-调用-更新的动态策略优化工作流

Conclusion: RLFactory提供了一个低门槛、高适应性的框架，可有效增强LLM在真实场景中的多轮工具使用能力

Abstract: Large language models excel at basic reasoning but struggle with tasks that
require interaction with external tools. We present RLFactory, a plug-and-play
reinforcement learning post-training framework for multi-round tool use.
RLFactory tackles (i) tool-call stability and adaptability amid tool
heterogeneity and interface issues via an asyncio-based asynchronous caller and
a decoupled tool/training architecture, and (ii) diverse evaluation needs via a
reward layer supporting rule-based, model-judgment, and tool-verification
signals. It reconstructs the MDP by introducing observation markers from tool
feedback, closing the loop among model, tools, and environment, and implements
a generate-parse-invoke-update workflow for dynamic policy optimization. On
Search-R1 with Qwen3-4B, RLFactory achieves a 0.486 test score on the Natural
Questions (NQ) dataset, surpassing larger models trained with similar
techniques (e.g., Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct-GRPO at 0.473), and increases training
throughput by 6.8x. RLFactory provides a low-barrier, highly adaptable
framework for strengthening multi-round tool use of LLMs in real-world
scenarios. Code: https://github.com/Simple-Efficient/RL-Factory.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 识别PTQ在量化过程中对少数群体造成不成比例的负面影响，并探索这种不平等性的根源和机制。

Method: 分析量化导致的权重和激活值变化对网络的铃式影响，研究对梯度范数和Hessian矩阵特征值的影响，提出结合混合精度QAT、数据集采样和权重损失函数的解决方案。

Result: 量化会导致输出logits方差降低、损失增加以及不同群体准确率受损，对少数群体的影响更为显著。

Conclusion: 通过整合混合精度QAT、数据采样和权重损失函数的方法，可以减少量化过程中的不平等影响，实现更公平的量化神经网络部署。

Abstract: Post Training Quantization (PTQ) is widely adopted due to its high
compression capacity and speed with minimal impact on accuracy. However, we
observed that disparate impacts are exacerbated by quantization, especially for
minority groups. Our analysis explains that in the course of quantization there
is a chain of factors attributed to a disparate impact across groups during
forward and backward passes. We explore how the changes in weights and
activations induced by quantization cause cascaded impacts in the network,
resulting in logits with lower variance, increased loss, and compromised group
accuracies. We extend our study to verify the influence of these impacts on
group gradient norms and eigenvalues of the Hessian matrix, providing insights
into the state of the network from an optimization point of view. To mitigate
these effects, we propose integrating mixed precision Quantization Aware
Training (QAT) with dataset sampling methods and weighted loss functions,
therefore providing fair deployment of quantized neural networks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型在现实应用中的部署增加，确保解码时输出安全成为关键挑战，现有方法往往在安全性和响应质量之间存在严重权衡

Method: 提出CARE框架，包含三个核心组件：1)实时安全监控的守卫模型；2)带令牌缓冲的回滚机制；3)基于自省的干预策略，模型生成自我反思并纳入上下文指导后续解码

Result: 实验结果表明该框架在安全性、质量和效率方面达到优越平衡，有害响应率低，对用户体验干扰最小，同时保持高响应质量

Conclusion: CARE框架通过精确干预、及时纠正和有效自校正，实现了安全性和响应质量之间的优越权衡，为解码时安全对齐提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in real-world
applications, ensuring the safety of their outputs during decoding has become a
critical challenge. However, existing decoding-time interventions, such as
Contrastive Decoding, often force a severe trade-off between safety and
response quality. In this work, we propose CARE, a novel framework for
decoding-time safety alignment that integrates three key components: (1) a
guard model for real-time safety monitoring, enabling detection of potentially
unsafe content; (2) a rollback mechanism with a token buffer to correct unsafe
outputs efficiently at an earlier stage without disrupting the user experience;
and (3) a novel introspection-based intervention strategy, where the model
generates self-reflective critiques of its previous outputs and incorporates
these reflections into the context to guide subsequent decoding steps. The
framework achieves a superior safety-quality trade-off by using its guard model
for precise interventions, its rollback mechanism for timely corrections, and
our novel introspection method for effective self-correction. Experimental
results demonstrate that our framework achieves a superior balance of safety,
quality, and efficiency, attaining a low harmful response rate and minimal
disruption to the user experience while maintaining high response quality.

Motivation: 在气候变化带来的不确定性背景下，水资源安全成为重要全球问题。虽然智能计量技术提供了将市水用户消费数据，但水需求预测仍面临气象等非确定性因素的挑战

Method: 采用无监督对比学习将用户按消费行为分类，然后将这些特征作为波小变换卷积网络的输入，结合跨注意力机制融合历史数据和用户表征进行需求预测

Result: 在真实区域计量区域进行了六个月的评估，在不同DMA中均显示出预测性能提升，最大MAPE提升达4.9%，同时识别出受社会经济因素影响的用户行为

Conclusion: 该方法不仅提高了短期水需求预测的准确性，还能够识别用户消费行为模式，为水务管理提供了更深入的见解

Abstract: Advancements in smart metering technologies have significantly improved the
ability to monitor and manage water utilities. In the context of increasing
uncertainty due to climate change, securing water resources and supply has
emerged as an urgent global issue with extensive socioeconomic ramifications.
Hourly consumption data from end-users have yielded substantial insights for
projecting demand across regions characterized by diverse consumption patterns.
Nevertheless, the prediction of water demand remains challenging due to
influencing non-deterministic factors, such as meteorological conditions. This
work introduces a novel method for short-term water demand forecasting for
District Metered Areas (DMAs) which encompass commercial, agricultural, and
residential consumers. Unsupervised contrastive learning is applied to
categorize end-users according to distinct consumption behaviors present within
a DMA. Subsequently, the distinct consumption behaviors are utilized as
features in the ensuing demand forecasting task using wavelet-transformed
convolutional networks that incorporate a cross-attention mechanism combining
both historical data and the derived representations. The proposed approach is
evaluated on real-world DMAs over a six-month period, demonstrating improved
forecasting performance in terms of MAPE across different DMAs, with a maximum
improvement of 4.9%. Additionally, it identifies consumers whose behavior is
shaped by socioeconomic factors, enhancing prior knowledge about the
deterministic patterns that influence demand.

Method: 提出FediLoRA框架，包含维度聚合策略（重新加权LoRA更新）和轻量级层间模型编辑方法（选择性整合全局参数修复本地组件）

Result: 在三个多模态基准数据集上实验表明，FediLoRA在全局和个性化设置中均优于基线方法，特别是在模态不完整情况下表现优异

Conclusion: FediLoRA有效解决了联邦多模态学习中的异构秩和模态缺失问题，为实际部署提供了实用解决方案

Abstract: Foundation models have demonstrated remarkable performance across a wide
range of tasks, yet their large parameter sizes pose challenges for practical
deployment, especially in decentralized environments. Parameter-efficient
fine-tuning (PEFT), such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), reduces local computing
and memory overhead, making it attractive for federated learning. However,
existing federated LoRA methods typically assume uniform rank configurations
and unimodal inputs, overlooking two key real-world challenges: (1)
heterogeneous client resources have different LoRA ranks, and (2) multimodal
data settings with potentially missing modalities. In this work, we propose
FediLoRA, a simple yet effective framework for federated multimodal fine-tuning
under heterogeneous LoRA ranks and missing modalities. FediLoRA introduces a
dimension-wise aggregation strategy that reweights LoRA updates without
information dilution during aggregation. It also includes a lightweight
layer-wise model editing method that selectively incorporates global parameters
to repair local components which improves both client and global model
performances. Experimental results on three multimodal benchmark datasets
demonstrate that FediLoRA achieves superior performance over competitive
baselines in both global and personalized settings, particularly in the
presence of modality incompleteness.

Motivation: 代理基冠病模型的检定过程计算成本高，需要一种更高效的检定方法来提高模型参数估计的速度和准确性。

Method: 使用三层双向LSTM网络，输入60天发病率、人口规模和恢复率，输出传播概率、接触率和R0。训练中采用包含流行病学动机一致性惩罚项的复合损失函数。

Result: 在1000个场景的模拟研究中，该方法在所有目标参数上都得到更低的错误（MAE：R0 0.0616 vs 0.275），产生更紧凑的预测区间，并将每次检定的声钟时间从77.4秒减少到2.35秒。

Conclusion: 这种监督学习检定器能够更准确地重现冠状病曲线，实现了快速而实用的模型检定，虽然接触率和传播概率存在部分不可识别性问题。

Abstract: Calibrating agent-based epidemic models is computationally demanding. We
present a supervised machine learning calibrator that learns the inverse
mapping from epidemic time series to SIR parameters. A three-layer
bidirectional LSTM ingests 60-day incidence together with population size and
recovery rate, and outputs transmission probability, contact rate, and R0.
Training uses a composite loss with an epidemiology-motivated consistency
penalty that encourages R0 \* recovery rate to equal transmission probability
\* contact rate.
  In a 1000-scenario simulation study, we compare the calibrator with
Approximate Bayesian Computation (likelihood-free MCMC). The method achieves
lower error across all targets (MAE: R0 0.0616 vs 0.275; transmission 0.0715 vs
0.128; contact 1.02 vs 4.24), produces tighter predictive intervals with near
nominal coverage, and reduces wall clock time from 77.4 s to 2.35 s per
calibration. Although contact rate and transmission probability are partially
nonidentifiable, the approach reproduces epidemic curves more faithfully than
ABC, enabling fast and practical calibration. We evaluate it on SIR agent based
epidemics generated with epiworldR and provide an implementation in R.

Conclusion: 提出的时序DRL环境和端到端调度模型有效解决了FJSP问题，为深度强化学习在调度领域的应用提供了新的环境建模思路。

Abstract: The Flexible Job-shop Scheduling Problem (FJSP) is a classical combinatorial
optimization problem that has a wide-range of applications in the real world.
In order to generate fast and accurate scheduling solutions for FJSP, various
deep reinforcement learning (DRL) scheduling methods have been developed.
However, these methods are mainly focused on the design of DRL scheduling
Agent, overlooking the modeling of DRL environment. This paper presents a
simple chronological DRL environment for FJSP based on discrete event
simulation and an end-to-end DRL scheduling model is proposed based on the
proximal policy optimization (PPO). Furthermore, a short novel state
representation of FJSP is proposed based on two state variables in the
scheduling environment and a novel comprehensible reward function is designed
based on the scheduling area of machines. Experimental results on public
benchmark instances show that the performance of simple priority dispatching
rules (PDR) is improved in our scheduling environment and our DRL scheduling
model obtains competing performance compared with OR-Tools, meta-heuristic, DRL
and PDR scheduling methods.

Abstract: The increasing size of large neural network models, specifically language
models and foundational image models, poses deployment challenges, prompting
efforts to reduce memory requirements and enhance computational efficiency.
These efforts are critical to ensure practical deployment and effective
utilization of these models across various applications. In this work, a novel
type of neural network layers and models is developed that uses only single-bit
parameters. In this novel type of models all parameters of all layers,
including kernel weights and biases, only have values equal to zero or one.
This novel type of models uses layers named as binary normalized layer. These
binary normalized layers can be of any type, such as fully connected,
convolutional, attention, etc., and they consist of slight variations of the
corresponding conventional layers. To show the effectiveness of the binary
normalized layers, two different models are configured to solve a multiclass
image classification problem and a language decoder to predict the next token
of a sequence. The model to solve the image classification has convolutional
and fully connected layers, and the language model is composed of transformer
blocks with multi-head attention. The results show that models with binary
normalized layers present almost the same results obtained by equivalent models
with real 32-bit parameters. The binary normalized layers allow to develop
models that use 32 times less memory than current models and have equivalent
performance. Besides, the binary normalized layers can be easily implemented on
current computers using 1-bit arrays, and do not require the development of
dedicated electronic hardware. This novel type of layers opens a new era for
large neural network models with reduced memory requirements that can be
deployed using simple and cheap hardware, such as mobile devices or only cpus.

Abstract: Slow feature analysis (SFA), as a method for learning slowly varying features
in classification and signal analysis, has attracted increasing attention in
recent years. Recent probabilistic extensions to SFA learn effective
representations for classification tasks. Notably, the Probabilistic Adaptive
Slow Feature Analysis models the slow features as states in an ARMA process and
estimate the model from the observations. However, there is a need to develop
efficient methods to infer the states (slow features) from the observations and
the model. In this paper, a recursive extension to the linear PASFA has been
proposed. The proposed algorithm performs MMSE estimation of states evolving
according to an ARMA process, given the observations and the model. Although
current methods tackle this problem using Kalman filters after transforming the
ARMA process into a state space model, the original states (or slow features)
that form useful representations cannot be easily recovered. The proposed
technique is evaluated on a synthetic dataset to demonstrate its correctness.

Abstract: The Bayesian paradigm offers principled tools for sequential decision-making
under uncertainty, but its reliance on a probabilistic model for all parameters
can hinder the incorporation of complex structural constraints. We introduce a
minimalist Bayesian framework that places a prior only on the component of
interest, such as the location of the optimum. Nuisance parameters are
eliminated via profile likelihood, which naturally handles constraints. As a
direct instantiation, we develop a MINimalist Thompson Sampling (MINTS)
algorithm. Our framework accommodates structured problems, including
continuum-armed Lipschitz bandits and dynamic pricing. It also provides a
probabilistic lens on classical convex optimization algorithms such as the
center of gravity and ellipsoid methods. We further analyze MINTS for
multi-armed bandits and establish near-optimal regret guarantees.

Conclusion: 该方法成功展示了因果结构学习与概率语言模型结合的价值，能够提供统计上可靠的异常检测和经济预测，为经济政策制定提供更稳健的决策支持。

Abstract: This paper presents a methodological approach to financial time series
analysis by combining causal discovery and uncertainty-aware forecasting. As a
case study, we focus on four key U.S. macroeconomic indicators -- GDP, economic
growth, inflation, and unemployment -- and we apply the LPCMCI framework with
Gaussian Process Distance Correlation (GPDC) to uncover dynamic causal
relationships in quarterly data from 1970 to 2021. Our results reveal a robust
unidirectional causal link from economic growth to GDP and highlight the
limited connectivity of inflation, suggesting the influence of latent factors.
Unemployment exhibits strong autoregressive dependence, motivating its use as a
case study for probabilistic forecasting. Leveraging the Chronos framework, a
large language model trained for time series, we perform zero-shot predictions
on unemployment. This approach delivers accurate forecasts one and two quarters
ahead, without requiring task-specific training. Crucially, the model's
uncertainty-aware predictions yield 90\% confidence intervals, enabling
effective anomaly detection through statistically principled deviation
analysis. This study demonstrates the value of combining causal structure
learning with probabilistic language models to inform economic policy and
enhance forecasting robustness.

Abstract: Artificial intelligence deployment for automated photovoltaic (PV) monitoring
faces interpretability barriers that limit adoption in energy infrastructure
applications. While deep learning achieves high accuracy in thermal fault
detection, validation that model decisions align with thermal physics
principles remains lacking, creating deployment hesitancy where understanding
model reasoning is critical. This study provides a systematic comparison of
convolutional neural networks (ResNet-18, EfficientNet-B0) and vision
transformers (ViT-Tiny, Swin-Tiny) for thermal PV fault detection, using XRAI
saliency analysis to assess alignment with thermal physics principles. This
represents the first systematic comparison of CNNs and vision transformers for
thermal PV fault detection with physics-validated interpretability. Evaluation
on 20,000 infrared images spanning normal operation and 11 fault categories
shows that Swin Transformer achieves the highest performance (94% binary
accuracy; 73% multiclass accuracy) compared to CNN approaches. XRAI analysis
reveals that models learn physically meaningful features, such as localized
hotspots for cell defects, linear thermal paths for diode failures, and thermal
boundaries for vegetation shading, consistent with expected thermal signatures.
However, performance varies significantly across fault types: electrical faults
achieve strong detection (F1-scores >0.90) while environmental factors like
soiling remain challenging (F1-scores 0.20-0.33), indicating limitations
imposed by thermal imaging resolution. The thermal physics-guided
interpretability approach provides methodology for validating AI
decision-making in energy monitoring applications, addressing deployment
barriers in renewable energy infrastructure.

Conclusion: lmKANs提供了一种高效的线性层替代方案，在保持模型灵活性的同时显著降低了计算成本，适用于各种深度学习架构。

Abstract: High-dimensional linear mappings, or linear layers, dominate both the
parameter count and the computational cost of most modern deep-learning models.
We introduce a general drop-in replacement, lookup multivariate
Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (lmKANs), which deliver a substantially better
trade-off between capacity and inference cost. Our construction expresses a
general high-dimensional mapping through trainable low-dimensional multivariate
functions. These functions can carry dozens or hundreds of trainable parameters
each, and yet it takes only a few multiplications to compute them because they
are implemented as spline lookup tables. Empirically, lmKANs reduce inference
FLOPs by up to 6.0x while matching the flexibility of MLPs in general
high-dimensional function approximation. In another feedforward fully connected
benchmark, on the tabular-like dataset of randomly displaced methane
configurations, lmKANs enable more than 10x higher H100 throughput at equal

cut inference FLOPs at matched accuracy by 1.6-2.1x and by 1.7x on the CIFAR-10

*Ziheng Chen,Xiao-Jun Wu,Nicu Sebe*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GyroBN是一个基于陀螺结构的黎曼批量归一化框架，将欧几里得批归一化扩展到非欧几里得流形数据，在七种代表性几何结构上验证了有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统归一化层的欧几里得公式不适用于流形数据，而许多机器学习中的黎曼流形具有陀螺结构，需要一种原则性的非欧几里得归一化方法。

Method: 提出GyroBN框架，建立伪约简和陀螺等距陀螺两个必要条件来保证理论控制，并在所有已知陀螺群上验证条件成立，实例化到七种几何结构。

Result: 实验在包括Grassmannian、五种常曲率空间和相关流形在内的七种几何结构上证明了GyroBN的有效性。

Conclusion: GyroBN提供了一个统一的黎曼批量归一化框架，将现有方法作为特例包含，并为非欧几里得深度学习提供了理论基础。

Abstract: Normalization layers are crucial for deep learning, but their Euclidean
formulations are inadequate for data on manifolds. On the other hand, many
Riemannian manifolds in machine learning admit gyro-structures, enabling
principled extensions of Euclidean neural networks to non-Euclidean domains.
Inspired by this, we introduce GyroBN, a principled Riemannian batch
normalization framework for gyrogroups. We establish two necessary conditions,
namely \emph{pseudo-reduction} and \emph{gyroisometric gyrations}, that
guarantee GyroBN with theoretical control over sample statistics, and show that
these conditions hold for all known gyrogroups in machine learning. Our
framework also incorporates several existing Riemannian normalization methods
as special cases. We further instantiate GyroBN on seven representative
geometries, including the Grassmannian, five constant curvature spaces, and the
correlation manifold, and derive novel gyro and Riemannian structures to enable
these instantiations. Experiments across these geometries demonstrate the
effectiveness of GyroBN. The code is available at

*Adrian Hayler,Xingyue Huang,İsmail İlkan Ceylan,Michael Bronstein,Ben Finkelshtein*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出TabGFM框架，通过将图数据转换为表格格式，利用表格基础模型进行零样本节点分类，在28个实际数据集上超越了现有图基础模型和任务特定GNN模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图基础模型在真实图数据上的泛化性能力有限，而表格基础模型在多个领域都表现出艰强的适用性，因此考虑将节点分类重构为表格问题。

Method: 首先通过特征和结构编码器将图转换为表格，然后应用多个表格基础模型对多样化子采样表格进行处理，最后通过集成选择汇总输出结果。

Result: 在28个真实世界数据集上，TabGFM实现了一致性的性能提升，超过了任务特定GNN和最先进的图基础模型。

Conclusion: 表格重构方法为可扩展和可泛化的图学习提供了新的潜力，TabGFM框架证明了这种方法的有效性。

Abstract: Graph foundation models (GFMs) have recently emerged as a promising paradigm
for achieving broad generalization across various graph data. However, existing
GFMs are often trained on datasets that were shown to poorly represent
real-world graphs, limiting their generalization performance. In contrast,
tabular foundation models (TFMs) not only excel at classical tabular prediction
tasks but have also shown strong applicability in other domains such as time
series forecasting, natural language processing, and computer vision. Motivated
by this, we take an alternative view to the standard perspective of GFMs and
reformulate node classification as a tabular problem. Each node can be
represented as a row with feature, structure, and label information as columns,
enabling TFMs to directly perform zero-shot node classification via in-context
learning. In this work, we introduce TabGFM, a graph foundation model framework
that first converts a graph into a table via feature and structural encoders,
applies multiple TFMs to diversely subsampled tables, and then aggregates their
outputs through ensemble selection. Through experiments on 28 real-world
datasets, TabGFM achieves consistent improvements over task-specific GNNs and
state-of-the-art GFMs, highlighting the potential of tabular reformulation for
scalable and generalizable graph learning.

*Anatoly A. Krasnovsky*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于层论/上同调和因果涌现理论的EICS评分方法，用于量化Transformer电路中功能子图的行为一致性和可信度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺乏形式化的单次计算方法来量化Transformer电路的行为一致性和可信度，需要一种白盒、单次通过的方法来评估功能子图的可靠性

Method: 结合层论不一致性计算和高斯有效信息代理，从局部Jacobian和激活状态构建EICS评分，该方法为白盒、单次通过且无量纲

Result: 提出了EICS评分框架，提供实用的评分解释指南、计算开销分析（快速和精确模式）以及玩具验证分析

Conclusion: EICS为评估Transformer电路的行为一致性和因果涌现提供了一种理论框架，但实证验证仍需在LLM任务上进行

Abstract: Mechanistic interpretability has identified functional subgraphs within large
language models (LLMs), known as Transformer Circuits (TCs), that appear to
implement specific algorithms. Yet we lack a formal, single-pass way to
quantify when an active circuit is behaving coherently and thus likely
trustworthy. Building on prior systems-theoretic proposals, we specialize a
sheaf/cohomology and causal emergence perspective to TCs and introduce the
Effective-Information Consistency Score (EICS). EICS combines (i) a normalized
sheaf inconsistency computed from local Jacobians and activations, with (ii) a
Gaussian EI proxy for circuit-level causal emergence derived from the same
forward state. The construction is white-box, single-pass, and makes units
explicit so that the score is dimensionless. We further provide practical
guidance on score interpretation, computational overhead (with fast and exact
modes), and a toy sanity-check analysis. Empirical validation on LLM tasks is
deferred.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PLaID++是一个基于大语言模型的晶体结构生成方法，通过Wyckoff文本表示和强化学习技术，能够高效生成稳定、新颖且具有特定空间群性质的晶体材料


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统材料发现过程缓慢且昂贵，需要加速新材料开发流程，特别是太阳能电池、电池和碳捕获等关键技术领域

Method: 基于Qwen-2.5 7B模型进行微调，使用Wyckoff文本表示法生成晶体结构，并采用基于Direct Preference Optimization的强化学习技术来引导生成过程

Result: 相比现有方法，PLaID++生成热力学稳定、独特且新颖结构的成功率提高约50%，在无条件和空间群条件生成方面分别实现约115%和50%的改进

Conclusion: 该工作展示了将自然语言处理的后训练技术应用于材料设计的潜力，为靶向高效发现新材料开辟了新途径

Abstract: Discovering novel materials is critical for technological advancements such
as solar cells, batteries, and carbon capture. However, the development of new
materials is constrained by a slow and expensive trial-and-error process. To
accelerate this pipeline, we introduce PLaID++, a Large Language Model (LLM)
fine-tuned for stable and property-guided crystal generation. We fine-tune
Qwen-2.5 7B to generate crystal structures using a novel Wyckoff-based text
representation. We show that generation can be effectively guided with a
reinforcement learning technique based on Direct Preference Optimization (DPO),
with sampled structures categorized by their stability, novelty, and space
group. By encoding symmetry constraints directly into text and guiding model
outputs towards desirable chemical space, PLaID++ generates structures that are
thermodynamically stable, unique, and novel at a $\sim$50\% greater rate than
prior methods and conditionally generates structures with desired space group
properties. Our experiments highlight the effectiveness of iterative DPO,
achieving $\sim$115\% and $\sim$50\% improvements in unconditional and space
group conditioned generation, respectively, compared to fine-tuning alone. Our
work demonstrates the potential of adapting post-training techniques from
natural language processing to materials design, paving the way for targeted
and efficient discovery of novel materials.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Fed-REACT是一个针对异构和动态变化客户端数据的联邦学习框架，通过表示学习和进化聚类两阶段方法，提升模型在真实场景中的准确性和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决联邦学习中客户端数据分布随时间演变和跨客户端显著差异导致的性能下降问题，克服集中式机器学习的高资源成本和隐私担忧。

Method: 采用两阶段过程：第一阶段客户端学习本地模型提取特征表示；第二阶段服务器基于表示动态聚类客户端，协调集群级别的任务特定模型训练。

Result: 理论分析了表示学习阶段，实证证明在真实数据集上实现了优越的准确性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: Fed-REACT框架有效解决了联邦学习中的异构性和数据演变问题，为下游分类或回归任务提供了高性能解决方案。

Abstract: Motivated by the high resource costs and privacy concerns associated with
centralized machine learning, federated learning (FL) has emerged as an
efficient alternative that enables clients to collaboratively train a global
model while keeping their data local. However, in real-world deployments,
client data distributions often evolve over time and differ significantly
across clients, introducing heterogeneity that degrades the performance of
standard FL algorithms. In this work, we introduce Fed-REACT, a federated
learning framework designed for heterogeneous and evolving client data.
Fed-REACT combines representation learning with evolutionary clustering in a
two-stage process: (1) in the first stage, each client learns a local model to
extracts feature representations from its data; (2) in the second stage, the
server dynamically groups clients into clusters based on these representations
and coordinates cluster-wise training of task-specific models for downstream
objectives such as classification or regression. We provide a theoretical
analysis of the representation learning stage, and empirically demonstrate that
Fed-REACT achieves superior accuracy and robustness on real-world datasets.

Abstract: In pharmaceutical R&D, predicting the efficacy of a pharmaceutical in
treating a particular disease prior to clinical testing or any real-world use
has been challenging. In this paper, we propose a flexible and modular machine
learning-based approach for predicting the efficacy of an untested
pharmaceutical for treating a disease. We train a machine learning model using
sets of pharmaceutical-pathway weight impact scores and patient data, which can
include patient characteristics and observed clinical outcomes. The resulting
model then analyses weighted impact scores of an untested pharmaceutical across
human biological molecule-protein pathways to generate a predicted efficacy
value. We demonstrate how the method works on a real-world dataset with patient
treatments and outcomes, with two different weight impact score algorithms We
include methods for evaluating the generalisation performance on unseen
treatments, and to characterise conditions under which the approach can be
expected to be most predictive. We discuss specific ways in which our approach
can be iterated on, making it an initial framework to support future work on
predicting the effect of untested drugs, leveraging RWD clinical data and drug
embeddings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数学推理任务需要高计算成本，现有模型参数设置常常没有进行系统化优化，影响了效率和性能。需要一个标准化的参数优化框架来提升模型在数学推理任务上的表现。

Method: 开发了一个整体优化框架，系统性地搜索参数空间，包括temperature(0.1-0.5)、推理步骤(4-12)、规划周期(1-4)和nucleus sampling(0.85-0.98)。在Qwen2.5-72B、Llama-3.1-70B、DeepSeek-V3、Mixtral-8x22B和Yi-Lightning等五款SOTA模型上进行测试，通过数学推理基准测试确定最优配置。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了一个标准化的生产实践参数优化框架，证明了通过系统化参数调优可以在保持解决方案正确性的同时实现显著的效率提升。发现的普遍优化趋势可以跨模型架构应用，为大型语言模型在数学推理任务上的实际部署提供了重要参考。

Abstract: This paper presents a practical investigation into fine-tuning model
parameters for mathematical reasoning tasks through experimenting with various
configurations including randomness control, reasoning depth, and sampling
strategies, careful tuning demonstrates substantial improvements in efficiency
as well as performance. A holistically optimized framework is introduced for
five state-of-the-art models on mathematical reasoning tasks, exhibiting
significant performance boosts while maintaining solution correctness. Through
systematic parameter optimization across Qwen2.5-72B, Llama-3.1-70B,
DeepSeek-V3, Mixtral-8x22B, and Yi-Lightning, consistent efficiency gains are
demonstrated with 100% optimization success rate. The methodology achieves an
average 29.4% reduction in computational cost and 23.9% improvement in
inference speed across all tested models. This framework systematically
searches parameter spaces including temperature (0.1-0.5), reasoning steps
(4-12), planning periods (1-4), and nucleus sampling (0.85-0.98), determining
optimal configurations through testing on mathematical reasoning benchmarks.
Critical findings show that lower temperature regimes (0.1-0.4) and reduced
reasoning steps (4-6) consistently enhance efficiency without compromising
accuracy. DeepSeek-V3 achieves the highest accuracy at 98%, while Mixtral-8x22B
delivers the most cost-effective performance at 361.5 tokens per accurate
response. Key contributions include: (1) the first comprehensive optimization

TL;DR: IP-Basis PINNs是一种元学习框架，通过离线-在线分解解决多查询逆问题，显著降低计算成本，实现快速参数估计。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统PINNs在多查询逆问题中计算成本高昂，每个新观测数据集都需要重新训练，需要一种更高效的推理方法。

Method: 采用离线-在线分解：离线训练深度网络生成基函数，在线冻结网络仅训练轻量级线性输出层，结合前向模式自动微分和新型在线损失函数。

Result: 在三个不同基准测试中表现一致，相比标准PINNs显著加速，在稀缺和噪声数据下鲁棒运行。

Conclusion: IP-Basis PINNs为多查询逆问题提供了一种计算高效的解决方案，在保持性能的同时大幅降低计算开销。

Abstract: Solving inverse problems with Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) is
computationally expensive for multi-query scenarios, as each new set of
observed data requires a new, expensive training procedure. We present
Inverse-Parameter Basis PINNs (IP-Basis PINNs), a meta-learning framework that
extends the foundational work of Desai et al. (2022) to enable rapid and
efficient inference for inverse problems. Our method employs an offline-online
decomposition: a deep network is first trained offline to produce a rich set of
basis functions that span the solution space of a parametric differential
equation. For each new inverse problem online, this network is frozen, and
solutions and parameters are inferred by training only a lightweight linear
output layer against observed data. Key innovations that make our approach
effective for inverse problems include: (1) a novel online loss formulation for
simultaneous solution reconstruction and parameter identification, (2) a
significant reduction in computational overhead via forward-mode automatic
differentiation for PDE loss evaluation, and (3) a non-trivial validation and
early-stopping mechanism for robust offline training. We demonstrate the
efficacy of IP-Basis PINNs on three diverse benchmarks, including an extension
to universal PINNs for unknown functional terms-showing consistent performance
across constant and functional parameter estimation, a significant speedup per
query over standard PINNs, and robust operation with scarce and noisy data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多任务学习中梯度冲突是一个重要挑战，现有方法如PCGrad、CAGrad和GradNorm在大型模型和transformer中计算成本过高，限制了实际应用。

Method: 结合PCGrad原理、梯度累积和自适应仲裁机制，开发了Gradient Conductor (GCond)方法，提供随机模式和确定性模式两种实现。

Result: 在ImageNet 1K和头颈CT数据集上，GCond在所有评估指标上表现优异，L1和SSIM损失更低，对MobileNetV3-Small和ConvNeXt等不同规模模型都表现出高可扩展性，且与现代优化器兼容。

Conclusion: GCond为多任务学习中的梯度冲突问题提供了一个可扩展且高效的解决方案，在计算效率和性能方面都优于现有方法。

Abstract: In multi-task learning (MTL), gradient conflict poses a significant
challenge. Effective methods for addressing this problem, including PCGrad,
CAGrad, and GradNorm, in their original implementations are computationally
demanding, which significantly limits their application in modern large models
and transformers. We propose Gradient Conductor (GCond), a method that builds
upon PCGrad principles by combining them with gradient accumulation and an
adaptive arbitration mechanism. We evaluated GCond on self-supervised learning
tasks using MobileNetV3-Small and ConvNeXt architectures on the ImageNet 1K
dataset and a combined head and neck CT scan dataset, comparing the proposed
method against baseline linear combinations and state-of-the-art gradient
conflict resolution methods. The stochastic mode of GCond achieved a two-fold
computational speedup while maintaining optimization quality, and demonstrated
superior performance across all evaluated metrics, achieving lower L1 and SSIM
losses compared to other methods on both datasets. GCond exhibited high
scalability, being successfully applied to both compact models
(MobileNetV3-Small) and large architectures (ConvNeXt-tiny and ConvNeXt-Base).
It also showed compatibility with modern optimizers such as AdamW and
Lion/LARS. Therefore, GCond offers a scalable and efficient solution to the
problem of gradient conflicts in multi-task learning.

Conclusion: 框架能够在有界不确定性下提高预测准确性，适用于多种温顿动力学系统的学习

Abstract: We introduce a robust framework for learning various generalized Hamiltonian
dynamics from noisy, sparse phase-space data and in an unsupervised manner
based on variational Bayesian inference. Although conservative, dissipative,
and port-Hamiltonian systems might share the same initial total energy of a
closed system, it is challenging for a single Hamiltonian network model to
capture the distinctive and varying motion dynamics and physics of a phase
space, from sampled observational phase space trajectories. To address this
complicated Hamiltonian manifold learning challenge, we extend sparse
symplectic, random Fourier Gaussian processes learning with predictive
successive numerical estimations of the Hamiltonian landscape, using a
generalized form of state and conjugate momentum Hamiltonian dynamics,
appropriate to different classes of conservative, dissipative and
port-Hamiltonian physical systems. In addition to the kernelized evidence lower
bound (ELBO) loss for data fidelity, we incorporate stability and conservation
constraints as additional hyper-parameter balanced loss terms to regularize the
model's multi-gradients, enforcing physics correctness for improved prediction
accuracy with bounded uncertainty.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将密码破译作为研究神经网络在组合复杂领域中泛化能力的理想测试平台，该任务需要从26!种可能映射中选择正确的替换密码映射。

Method: 开发了ALICE架构，使用仅编码器Transformer和新型双射解码头，通过Gumbel-Sinkhorn方法显式建模排列，可直接提取学习到的密码映射。

Result: ALICE在仅训练约1500个独特密码（占可能密码空间的极小部分3.7×10^{-24}）后就能泛化到未见过的密码，并通过早期退出分析揭示了模型逐步优化预测的过程。

Conclusion: 该架构创新和分析方法可扩展到任何具有双射映射和组合结构的领域，为神经网络泛化能力和可解释性提供了新见解。

Abstract: We present cryptogram solving as an ideal testbed for studying neural network
generalization in combinatorially complex domains. In this task, models must
decrypt text encoded with substitution ciphers, choosing from 26! possible
mappings without explicit access to the cipher. We develop ALICE (an
Architecture for Learning Interpretable Cryptogram dEcipherment): a simple
encoder-only Transformer that sets a new state-of-the-art for both accuracy and
speed on this decryption problem. Surprisingly, ALICE generalizes to unseen
ciphers after training on only ${\sim}1500$ unique ciphers, a minute fraction
($3.7 \times 10^{-24}$) of the possible cipher space. To enhance
interpretability, we introduce a novel bijective decoding head that explicitly
models permutations via the Gumbel-Sinkhorn method, enabling direct extraction
of learned cipher mappings. Through early exit analysis, we reveal how ALICE
progressively refines its predictions in a way that appears to mirror common
human strategies for this task: early layers employ frequency-based heuristics,
middle layers form word structures, and final layers correct individual
characters. Our architectural innovations and analysis methods extend beyond
cryptograms to any domain with bijective mappings and combinatorial structure,
offering new insights into neural network generalization and interpretability.

Motivation: 将复杂患者情况转化为NCCN指南推荐治疗耗时且易错，需要利用LLM能力提高效率和准确性

Method: 构建121例NSCLC患者纵向数据集，开发混合方法结合人工标注和模型一致性信息，创建指南预测代理框架和元分类器

Result: 模型与专家标注强相关（Spearman系数r=0.88），治疗推荐AUROC=0.800，显著降低标注成本

Conclusion: 建立了临床可行的LLM指南遵循系统框架，平衡准确性、可解释性和监管要求，为自动化临床决策支持提供可扩展路径

Abstract: The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) provides evidence-based
guidelines for cancer treatment. Translating complex patient presentations into
guideline-compliant treatment recommendations is time-intensive, requires
specialized expertise, and is prone to error. Advances in large language model
(LLM) capabilities promise to reduce the time required to generate treatment
recommendations and improve accuracy. We present an LLM agent-based approach to
automatically generate guideline-concordant treatment trajectories for patients
with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Our contributions are threefold.
First, we construct a novel longitudinal dataset of 121 cases of NSCLC patients
that includes clinical encounters, diagnostic results, and medical histories,
each expertly annotated with the corresponding NCCN guideline trajectories by
board-certified oncologists. Second, we demonstrate that existing LLMs possess
domain-specific knowledge that enables high-quality proxy benchmark generation
for both model development and evaluation, achieving strong correlation
(Spearman coefficient r=0.88, RMSE = 0.08) with expert-annotated benchmarks.
Third, we develop a hybrid approach combining expensive human annotations with
model consistency information to create both the agent framework that predicts
the relevant guidelines for a patient, as well as a meta-classifier that
verifies prediction accuracy with calibrated confidence scores for treatment
recommendations (AUROC=0.800), a critical capability for communicating the
accuracy of outputs, custom-tailoring tradeoffs in performance, and supporting
regulatory compliance. This work establishes a framework for clinically viable
LLM-based guideline adherence systems that balance accuracy, interpretability,
and regulatory requirements while reducing annotation costs, providing a
scalable pathway toward automated clinical decision support.

Motivation: 电子健康记录中的人口统计属性是临床风险分层和治疗决策的重要预测因子，但在模型设计中往往被作为辅助角色，缺乏专门的表示学习方法。

Method: 开发GDP预训练模型，探索不同的排序策略和编码方法，将表格形式的人口统计输入转换为潜在嵌入表示，并在不同疾病和人群数据集上进行预训练和评估。

Result: 实验结果显示顺序排序显著提升了模型在判别、校准和决策树分裂信息增益方面的性能，特别是在年龄和性别对风险分层贡献显著的疾病中。即使在预测价值较低的数据集中，GDP也能增强表示重要性。

Conclusion: 针对表格人口统计属性的基础模型可以跨任务和人群泛化，为改善医疗保健应用的预测性能提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Demographic attributes are universally present in electronic health records
and serve as vital predictors in clinical risk stratification and treatment
decisions. Despite their significance, these attributes are often relegated to
auxiliary roles in model design, with limited attention has been given to
learning their representations. This study proposes a General Demographic
Pre-trained (GDP) model as a foundational representation framework tailored to
age and gender. The model is pre-trained and evaluated using datasets with
diverse diseases and population compositions from different geographic regions.
The GDP architecture explores combinations of ordering strategies and encoding
methods to transform tabular demographic inputs into latent embeddings.
Experimental results demonstrate that sequential ordering substantially
improves model performance in discrimination, calibration, and the
corresponding information gain at each decision tree split, particularly in
diseases where age and gender contribute significantly to risk stratification.
Even in datasets where demographic attributes hold relatively low predictive
value, GDP enhances the representational importance, increasing their influence
in downstream gradient boosting models. The findings suggest that foundational
models for tabular demographic attributes can generalize across tasks and
populations, offering a promising direction for improving predictive
performance in healthcare applications.

most existing studies assume static datasets, in real-world scenarios clients
may continuously collect data with time-varying and non-independent and
identically distributed (non-i.i.d.) characteristics. A critical challenge is
how to adapt models in a timely yet efficient manner to such evolving data. In
this paper, we propose FedTeddi, a temporal-drift-and-divergence-aware
scheduling algorithm that facilitates fast convergence of FEEL under dynamic
data evolution and communication resource limits. We first quantify the
temporal dynamics and non-i.i.d. characteristics of data using temporal drift
and collective divergence, respectively, and represent them as the Earth
Mover's Distance (EMD) of class distributions for classification tasks. We then
propose a novel optimization objective and develop a joint scheduling and
bandwidth allocation algorithm, enabling the FEEL system to learn from new data
quickly without forgetting previous knowledge. Experimental results show that
our algorithm achieves higher test accuracy and faster convergence compared to
benchmark methods, improving the rate of convergence by 58.4% on CIFAR-10 and
49.2% on CIFAR-100 compared to random scheduling.

*Qihu Xie,Yuan Li,Yi Kang*

TL;DR: SBS方法通过单向排序平滑和自适应傅里叶特征来抑制频谱偏差，显著提升了神经网络权重的隐式神经表示重建精度和参数效率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的隐式神经表示方法存在明显的频谱偏差问题，难以有效重建高频细节，限制了参数压缩效果

Method: 提出SBS方法：1）单向排序平滑改善输出空间核平滑度；2）基于排序平滑的自适应随机傅里叶特征，根据层参数数量调节输入编码频率带宽

Result: 在ResNet模型和CIFAR-10、CIFAR-100、ImageNet数据集上的广泛评估显示，SBS相比SOTA方法以更少参数实现了显著更好的重建精度

Conclusion: SBS通过有效抑制频谱偏差，为神经网络权重的隐式神经表示提供了参数效率更高的增强方案

Abstract: Implicit neural representations have recently been extended to represent
convolutional neural network weights via neural representation for neural
networks, offering promising parameter compression benefits. However, standard
multi-layer perceptrons used in neural representation for neural networks
exhibit a pronounced spectral bias, hampering their ability to reconstruct
high-frequency details effectively. In this paper, we propose SBS, a
parameter-efficient enhancement to neural representation for neural networks
that suppresses spectral bias using two techniques: (1) a unidirectional
ordering-based smoothing that improves kernel smoothness in the output space,
and (2) unidirectional ordering-based smoothing aware random fourier features
that adaptively modulate the frequency bandwidth of input encodings based on
layer-wise parameter count. Extensive evaluations on various ResNet models with
datasets CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and ImageNet, demonstrate that SBS achieves
significantly better reconstruction accuracy with less parameters compared to
SOTA.

Abstract: Cardiac arrest is one of the biggest global health problems, and early
identification and management are key to enhancing the patient's prognosis. In
this paper, we propose a novel framework that combines an EfficientNet-based
deep learning model with a digital twin system to improve the early detection

learn the features of cardiovascular images. In parallel, the digital twin
creates a realistic and individualized cardiovascular system model of the
patient based on data received from the Internet of Things (IoT) devices
attached to the patient, which can help in the constant assessment of the
patient and the impact of possible treatment plans. As shown by our
experiments, the proposed system is highly accurate in its prediction abilities
and, at the same time, efficient. Combining highly advanced techniques such as
deep learning and digital twin (DT) technology presents the possibility of
using an active and individual approach to predicting cardiac disease.

improved outlier-mitigation capability. Numerical experiments confirm
performance gains as compared to the state-of-the-art methods in terms of

TL;DR: 本文提出了DPH-RL框架，通过使用mass-covering f-divergence（如forward-KL和JS-divergence）作为排练机制，解决RLVR微调中多尝试性能退化问题，同时提升单尝试和多尝试性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型语言模型在RLVR微调中出现的多尝试性能（Pass@k）退化问题，以及灾难性遗忘现象，现有方法对散度项的选择和功能缺乏充分研究。

Method: 提出DPH-RL框架，使用mass-covering f-divergence（forward-KL和JS-divergence）作为排练机制，持续参考初始策略以保持广泛的解决方案覆盖。

Result: 在数学和SQL生成任务上的实验表明，DPH-RL不仅解决了Pass@k退化问题，还提升了域内和域外的Pass@1和Pass@k性能，且训练效率更高。

Conclusion: 散度度量的正确选择是改进RLVR的关键因素，DPH-RL通过保持多样性构建了更通用和多样化的推理模型。

Abstract: A central paradox in fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) with
Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Reward (RLVR) is the frequent
degradation of multi-attempt performance (Pass@k) despite improvements in
single-attempt accuracy (Pass@1). This is often accompanied by catastrophic
forgetting, where models lose previously acquired skills. While various methods
have been proposed, the choice and function of the divergence term have been
surprisingly unexamined as a proactive solution. We argue that standard RLVR
objectives -- both those using the mode-seeking reverse KL-divergence and those
forgoing a divergence term entirely -- lack a crucial mechanism for knowledge
retention. The reverse-KL actively accelerates this decay by narrowing the
policy, while its absence provides no safeguard against the model drifting from
its diverse knowledge base. We propose a fundamental shift in perspective:
using the divergence term itself as the solution. Our framework,
Diversity-Preserving Hybrid RL (DPH-RL), leverages mass-covering f-divergences
(like forward-KL and JS-divergence) to function as a rehearsal mechanism. By
continuously referencing the initial policy, this approach forces the model to
maintain broad solution coverage. Extensive experiments on math and SQL
generation demonstrate that DPH-RL not only resolves the Pass@k degradation but
improves both Pass@1 and Pass@k in- and out-of-domain. Additionally, DPH-RL is
more training-efficient because it computes f-divergence using generator
functions, requiring only sampling from the initial policy and no online
reference model. Our work highlights a crucial, overlooked axis for improving
RLVR, demonstrating that the proper selection of a divergence measure is a
powerful tool for building more general and diverse reasoning models.

Motivation: 解决现有推荐系统中无法同时处理显式评分和隐式反馈的问题，并提高预测的信息度和可解释性。

Method: 使用卷积自动编码器结构，能够学习不同交互类型的关联关系，同时处理显式评分和隐式反馈，并提供个别评分概率预测。

Result: 在多个实际数据集上达到了最先进的性能，同时在隐式和显式反馈预测任务上都表现优异。

Conclusion: 该模型不仅提高了预测准确性，还增强了模型的可解释性，能够识别用户可能喜欢但自然不会消费的内容。

Abstract: We introduce a new convolutional AutoEncoder architecture for user modelling
and recommendation tasks with several improvements over the state of the art.
Firstly, our model has the flexibility to learn a set of associations and
combinations between different interaction types in a way that carries over to
each user and item. Secondly, our model is able to learn jointly from both the
explicit ratings and the implicit information in the sampling pattern (which we
refer to as `implicit feedback'). It can also make separate predictions for the
probability of consuming content and the likelihood of granting it a high
rating if observed. This not only allows the model to make predictions for both
the implicit and explicit feedback, but also increases the informativeness of
the predictions: in particular, our model can identify items which users would
not have been likely to consume naturally, but would be likely to enjoy if
exposed to them. Finally, we provide several generalization bounds for our
model, which to the best of our knowledge, are among the first generalization
bounds for auto-encoders in a Recommender Systems setting; we also show that
optimizing our loss function guarantees the recovery of the exact sampling
distribution over interactions up to a small error in total variation. In
experiments on several real-life datasets, we achieve state-of-the-art
performance on both the implicit and explicit feedback prediction tasks despite
relying on a single model for both, and benefiting from additional
interpretability in the form of individual predictions for the probabilities of
each possible rating.

Result: 将CDL重新定位为实际事件发现和表征工具，扩展了其在压缩或去噪等传统任务之外的作用。

Conclusion: RoseCDL为大规模信号中的罕见事件检测提供了一个实用且高效的CDL框架。

Abstract: Identifying recurring patterns and rare events in large-scale signals is a
fundamental challenge in fields such as astronomy, physical simulations, and
biomedical science. Convolutional Dictionary Learning (CDL) offers a powerful
framework for modeling local structures in signals, but its use for detecting
rare or anomalous events remains largely unexplored. In particular, CDL faces
two key challenges in this setting: high computational cost and sensitivity to
artifacts and outliers. In this paper, we introduce RoseCDL, a scalable and
robust CDL algorithm designed for unsupervised rare event detection in long
signals. RoseCDL combines stochastic windowing for efficient training on large
datasets with inline outlier detection to enhance robustness and isolate
anomalous patterns. This reframes CDL as a practical tool for event discovery
and characterization in real-world signals, extending its role beyond
traditional tasks like compression or denoising.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RLVR在提升大语言模型推理能力方面显示出强大潜力，但训练过程中响应长度的大幅变化导致高梯度方差和不稳定优化，现有方法存在估计偏差或梯度方差高的问题

Method: 通过理论和实证分析不同长度对策略损失的影响，将问题重新表述为寻找最小方差无偏估计量，提出ΔL归一化方法

Result: 大量实验表明，该方法在不同模型大小、最大长度和任务上都能取得优异结果

Conclusion: ΔL归一化不仅提供真实策略损失的无偏估计，还能在理论上最小化梯度方差，是解决RLVR训练稳定性问题的有效方法

Abstract: We propose $\Delta L$ Normalization, a simple yet effective loss aggregation
method tailored to the characteristic of dynamic generation lengths in
Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR). Recently, RLVR has
demonstrated strong potential in improving the reasoning capabilities of large
language models (LLMs), but a major challenge lies in the large variability of
response lengths during training, which leads to high gradient variance and
unstable optimization. Although previous methods such as GRPO, DAPO, and Dr.
GRPO introduce different loss normalization terms to address this issue, they
either produce biased estimates or still suffer from high gradient variance. By
analyzing the effect of varying lengths on policy loss both theoretically and
empirically, we reformulate the problem as finding a minimum-variance unbiased
estimator. Our proposed $\Delta L$ Normalization not only provides an unbiased
estimate of the true policy loss but also minimizes gradient variance in
theory. Extensive experiments show that it consistently achieves superior
results across different model sizes, maximum lengths, and tasks. Our code will
be made public at https://github.com/zerolllin/Delta-L-Normalization.

Motivation: 传统神经网络神经元使用加权和加固定非线性激活函数，缺乏概率解释和多模态表示能力。uGMM-NN旨在将概率推理直接嵌入神经网络计算单元，在保持可扩展性的同时捕获神经元级别的多模态性和不确定性。

Method: 设计uGMM-NN节点，每个节点参数化其激活为单变量高斯混合模型，具有可学习的均值、方差和混合系数，取代传统的加权和激活函数结构。

Result: uGMM-NN在判别性能上与传统多层感知器相当，同时提供激活的概率解释，能够捕获神经元级别的多模态性和不确定性。

Conclusion: uGMM-NN为将不确定性感知组件集成到现代神经架构中提供了基础，为判别性和生成性建模开辟了新方向。

Abstract: This paper introduces the Univariate Gaussian Mixture Model Neural Network
(uGMM-NN), a novel neural architecture that embeds probabilistic reasoning
directly into the computational units of deep networks. Unlike traditional
neurons, which apply weighted sums followed by fixed nonlinearities, each
uGMM-NN node parameterizes its activations as a univariate Gaussian mixture,
with learnable means, variances, and mixing coefficients. This design enables
richer representations by capturing multimodality and uncertainty at the level
of individual neurons, while retaining the scalability of standard feedforward
networks. We demonstrate that uGMM-NN can achieve competitive discriminative
performance compared to conventional multilayer perceptrons, while additionally
offering a probabilistic interpretation of activations. The proposed framework
provides a foundation for integrating uncertainty-aware components into modern
neural architectures, opening new directions for both discriminative and
generative modeling.

<details>

Motivation: 传统物理信息神经网络(PINNs)在处理具有不连续系数的材料时经常失败，特别是在分段常数属性的介质中，需要更可靠的方法来解决多尺度建模中的偏微分方程。

Method: 引入双重公式化方法到PINN框架中，比较标准PINNs与变分PINNs(VPINNs)在使用谱和神经网络基测试函数时的表现，通过双重方法推导误差边界。

Result: 强形式PINNs在受控环境下可能优于VPINNs，但对材料不连续性敏感且缺乏明确诊断；VPINNs能直接处理分段常数材料参数但需要仔细选择测试函数以避免不稳定。

Conclusion: 双重公式化可作为收敛质量的可靠指标，将其集成到PINN框架中增强了在微力学均质化问题中的适用性，提供了更稳健的故障检测机制。

Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have shown promise in solving
partial differential equations (PDEs) relevant to multiscale modeling, but they
often fail when applied to materials with discontinuous coefficients, such as
media with piecewise constant properties. This paper introduces a dual
formulation for the PINN framework to improve the reliability of the
homogenization of periodic thermo-conductive composites, for both strong and
variational (weak) formulations. The dual approach facilitates the derivation
of guaranteed upper and lower error bounds, enabling more robust detection of
PINN failure. We compare standard PINNs applied to smoothed material
approximations with variational PINNs (VPINNs) using both spectral and neural
network-based test functions. Our results indicate that while strong-form PINNs
may outperform VPINNs in controlled settings, they are sensitive to material
discontinuities and may fail without clear diagnostics. In contrast, VPINNs
accommodate piecewise constant material parameters directly but require careful
selection of test functions to avoid instability. Dual formulation serves as a
reliable indicator of convergence quality, and its integration into PINN
frameworks enhances their applicability to homogenization problems in
micromechanics.

Abstract: This paper presents an innovative Transformer-based deep learning strategy

physics-aware statistical data augmentation, is exploited to train a hybrid
Convolutional Neural Network and Transformer model. The model achieves high
accuracy (99.83%) in classifying the probe card health states (baseline, loose
screw, crack) and an excellent crack detection recall (99.73%). Model
robustness is confirmed through a rigorous framework of 3 repetitions of
10-fold stratified cross-validation. The attention mechanism also pinpoints
critical sensor locations: an analysis of the attention weights offers
actionable insights for designing efficient, cost-effective monitoring systems
by optimizing sensor configurations. This research highlights the capability of
attention-based deep learning to advance proactive maintenance, enhancing

Abstract: Class imbalance poses a significant challenge to supervised classification,
particularly in critical domains like medical diagnostics and anomaly detection
where minority class instances are rare. While numerous studies have explored
rebalancing techniques to address this issue, less attention has been given to
evaluating the performance of binary classifiers under imbalance when no such
techniques are applied. Therefore, the goal of this study is to assess the
performance of binary classifiers "as-is", without performing any explicit
rebalancing. Specifically, we systematically evaluate the robustness of a
diverse set of binary classifiers across both real-world and synthetic
datasets, under progressively reduced minority class sizes, using one-shot and
few-shot scenarios as baselines. Our approach also explores varying data
complexities through synthetic decision boundary generation to simulate
real-world conditions. In addition to standard classifiers, we include
experiments using undersampling, oversampling strategies, and one-class
classification (OCC) methods to examine their behavior under severe imbalance.
The results confirm that classification becomes more difficult as data
complexity increases and the minority class size decreases. While traditional
classifiers deteriorate under extreme imbalance, advanced models like TabPFN
and boosting-based ensembles retain relatively higher performance and better
generalization compared to traditional classifiers. Visual interpretability and
evaluation metrics further validate these findings. Our work offers valuable
guidance on model selection for imbalanced learning, providing insights into
classifier robustness without dependence on explicit rebalancing techniques.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Abstract: Neighbour embeddings (NE) allow the representation of high dimensional
datasets into lower dimensional spaces and are often used in data
visualisation. In practice, accelerated approximations are employed to handle
very large datasets. Accelerating NE is challenging, and two main directions
have been explored: very coarse approximations based on negative sampling (as
in UMAP) achieve high effective speed but may lack quality in the extracted
structures; less coarse approximations, as used in FIt-SNE or BH-t-SNE, offer
better structure preservation at the cost of speed, while also restricting the
target dimensionality to 2 or 3, limiting NE to visualisation. In some
variants, the precision of these costlier accelerations also enables
finer-grained control on the extracted structures through dedicated
hyperparameters.
  This paper proposes to bridge the gab between both approaches by introducing
a novel way to accelerate NE, requiring a small number of computations per
iteration while maintaining good fine-grained structure preservation and
flexibility through hyperparameter tuning, without limiting the dimensionality
of the embedding space. The method was designed for interactive exploration of
data; as such, it abandons the traditional two-phased approach of other NE
methods, allowing instantaneous visual feedback when changing hyperparameters,
even when these control processes happening on the high-dimensional side of the
computations. Experiments using a publicly available, GPU accelerated GUI
integration of the method show promising results in terms of speed, flexibility
in the structures getting extracted, and show potential uses in broader machine
learning contexts with minimal algorithmic modifications. Central to this
algorithm is a novel approach to iterative approximate nearest neighbour
search, which shows promising results compared to nearest neighbour descent.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: IBN是一个可解释的双向建模网络，用于处理多变量时间序列预测中的变量缺失问题，通过不确定性感知插值和图卷积网络提升预测性能和可解释性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法GinAR虽然首次使用注意力机制处理变量缺失，但缺乏可解释性且无法捕捉潜在时间模式，需要更可靠和可解释的解决方案

Method: 结合不确定性感知插值(UAI)和高斯核图卷积(GGCN)，使用MC Dropout估计重构值的不确定性，采用双向递归单元增强时间依赖建模

Result: 在各种缺失率场景下实现了最先进的预测性能

Conclusion: IBN为具有缺失变量的多变量时间序列预测提供了一个更可靠和可解释的框架

Abstract: Multivariate time series forecasting (MTSF) often faces challenges from
missing variables, which hinder conventional spatial-temporal graph neural
networks in modeling inter-variable correlations. While GinAR addresses
variable missing using attention-based imputation and adaptive graph learning
for the first time, it lacks interpretability and fails to capture more latent
temporal patterns due to its simple recursive units (RUs). To overcome these
limitations, we propose the Interpretable Bidirectional-modeling Network (IBN),
integrating Uncertainty-Aware Interpolation (UAI) and Gaussian kernel-based
Graph Convolution (GGCN). IBN estimates the uncertainty of reconstructed values
using MC Dropout and applies an uncertainty-weighted strategy to mitigate
high-risk reconstructions. GGCN explicitly models spatial correlations among
variables, while a bidirectional RU enhances temporal dependency modeling.
Extensive experiments show that IBN achieves state-of-the-art forecasting
performance under various missing-rate scenarios, providing a more reliable and
interpretable framework for MTSF with missing variables. Code is available at:

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出使用误差有界压缩算法压缩MoE模型中的非激活专家，减少GPU内存与主存间的数据传输开销，并分析不同层级专家压缩误差对推理精度的影响


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着MoE模型在LLM学习中的广泛应用，在有限GPU内存约束下高效服务MoE模型成为重要挑战。将非激活专家卸载到主内存是有效方法，但带来了专家数据传输的挑战，需要探索高效的专家压缩方法并分析压缩误差对推理性能的影响

Method: 采用误差有界损失压缩算法（如SZ3和CuSZp）压缩非激活专家，在不同基准测试上进行广泛实验，全面分析不同专家压缩误差对整体推理精度的影响

Result: 浅层专家（主要负责注意力机制和输入token向量化转换）在受到有界误差时推理精度下降最小；中间层专家（模型推理核心）的误差会显著损害推理精度；深层专家（主要负责指令跟随和输出整合）引入有界误差有时反而能提高推理精度

Conclusion: 误差有界压缩是减少MoE推理数据传输开销的有效方法，但需要针对不同层级专家的功能特点采用差异化的压缩策略，浅层和深层专家对压缩误差容忍度较高，而中间层专家需要更严格的误差控制

Abstract: With the widespread application of Mixture of Experts (MoE) reasoning models
in the field of LLM learning, efficiently serving MoE models under limited GPU
memory constraints has emerged as a significant challenge. Offloading the
non-activated experts to main memory has been identified as an efficient
approach to address such a problem, while it brings the challenges of
transferring the expert between the GPU memory and main memory. We need to
explore an efficient approach to compress the expert and analyze how the
compression error affects the inference performance.
  To bridge this gap, we propose employing error-bounded lossy compression
algorithms (such as SZ3 and CuSZp) to compress non-activated experts, thereby
reducing data transfer overhead during MoE inference. We conduct extensive
experiments across various benchmarks and present a comprehensive analysis of
how compression-induced errors in different experts affect overall inference
accuracy. The results indicate that experts in the shallow layers, which are
primarily responsible for the attention mechanism and the transformation of
input tokens into vector representations, exhibit minimal degradation in
inference accuracy when subjected to bounded errors. In contrast, errors in the
middle-layer experts, which are central to model reasoning, significantly
impair inference accuracy. Interestingly, introducing bounded errors in the
deep-layer experts, which are mainly responsible for instruction following and
output integration, can sometimes lead to improvements in inference accuracy.

particularly TCN and LSTM, produce stable and consistent forecasts, especially
under conditions of high temporal granularity. By comparing different model
architectures and input structures, this study highlights the importance of
ensemble forecasting in conflict modeling, and the value of publicly available
OSINT data in quantifying material degradation over time.

Conclusion: 整合文本和结构化车祸信息能显著提升个人层面伤害预测能力，为交通安全专业人员提供了改进碰撞严重程度建模、指导政策决策和设计更有效对策的实用框架。

Abstract: Predicting injuries and fatalities in traffic crashes plays a critical role
in enhancing road safety, improving emergency response, and guiding public
health interventions. This study investigates the added value of unstructured
crash narratives (written by police officers at the scene) when combined with
structured crash data to predict injury severity. Two widely used Natural
Language Processing (NLP) techniques, Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency
(TF-IDF) and Word2Vec, were employed to extract semantic meaning from the
narratives, and their effectiveness was compared. To address the challenge of
class imbalance, a K-Nearest Neighbors-based oversampling method was applied to
the training data prior to modeling. The dataset consists of crash records from
Kentucky spanning 2019 to 2023. To account for roadway heterogeneity, three
road classification schemes were used: (1) eight detailed functional classes
(e.g., Urban Two-Lane, Rural Interstate, Urban Multilane Divided), (2) four
broader paired categories (e.g., Urban vs. Rural, Freeway vs. Non-Freeway), and
(3) a unified dataset without classification. A total of 102 machine learning
models were developed by combining structured features and narrative-based
features using the two NLP techniques alongside three ensemble algorithms:
XGBoost, Random Forest, and AdaBoost. Results demonstrate that models
incorporating narrative data consistently outperform those relying solely on
structured data. Among all combinations, TF-IDF coupled with XGBoost yielded
the most accurate predictions in most subgroups. The findings highlight the
power of integrating textual and structured crash information to enhance
person-level injury prediction. This work offers a practical and adaptable
framework for transportation safety professionals to improve crash severity
modeling, guide policy decisions, and design more effective countermeasures.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 个性化能治疗需要在巨大的药物组合空间中找到最优疗法，但完整实验不可行，而分子截面信息获取困难，导致冷启动问题

Method: 利用历史药物响应数据预训练深度学习模型，生成药物组合嵌入和荷重重要性分数，通过聚类保证功能多样性，使用荷重机制优先考虑历史信息量高的荷重

Result: 在大规模药物组合数据集上的回顾性模拟显示，该方法显著提高了初始筛选效率，超过基线方法

Conclusion: 该策略为个性化能治疗组合药物筛选提供了可行的早期决策方案，有助于解决冷启动问题并提高疗效

Abstract: Personalizing combination therapies in oncology requires navigating an
immense space of possible drug and dose combinations, a task that remains
largely infeasible through exhaustive experimentation. Recent developments in
patient-derived models have enabled high-throughput ex vivo screening, but the
number of feasible experiments is limited. Further, a tight therapeutic window
makes gathering molecular profiling information (e.g. RNA-seq) impractical as a
means of guiding drug response prediction. This leads to a challenging
cold-start problem: how do we select the most informative combinations to test
early, when no prior information about the patient is available? We propose a
strategy that leverages a pretrained deep learning model built on historical
drug response data. The model provides both embeddings for drug combinations
and dose-level importance scores, enabling a principled selection of initial
experiments. We combine clustering of drug embeddings to ensure functional
diversity with a dose-weighting mechanism that prioritizes doses based on their
historical informativeness. Retrospective simulations on large-scale drug
combination datasets show that our method substantially improves initial
screening efficiency compared to baselines, offering a viable path for more
effective early-phase decision-making in personalized combination drug screens.

Conclusion: 该多组学SVR模型能够准确预测GTV连续变化，为PULSAR治疗提供了量化和个体化的评估方法，有助于病人选择和治疗调整

Abstract: Personalized ultra-fractionated stereotactic adaptive radiotherapy (PULSAR)
is a novel treatment that delivers radiation in pulses of protracted intervals.
Accurate prediction of gross tumor volume (GTV) changes through regression
models has substantial prognostic value. This study aims to develop a
multi-omics based support vector regression (SVR) model for predicting GTV
change. A retrospective cohort of 39 patients with 69 brain metastases was
analyzed, based on radiomics (MRI images) and dosiomics (dose maps) features.
Delta features were computed to capture relative changes between two time
points. A feature selection pipeline using least absolute shrinkage and
selection operator (Lasso) algorithm with weight- or frequency-based ranking
criterion was implemented. SVR models with various kernels were evaluated using
the coefficient of determination (R2) and relative root mean square error
(RRMSE). Five-fold cross-validation with 10 repeats was employed to mitigate
the limitation of small data size. Multi-omics models that integrate radiomics,
dosiomics, and their delta counterparts outperform individual-omics models.
Delta-radiomic features play a critical role in enhancing prediction accuracy
relative to features at single time points. The top-performing model achieves
an R2 of 0.743 and an RRMSE of 0.022. The proposed multi-omics SVR model shows
promising performance in predicting continuous change of GTV. It provides a
more quantitative and personalized approach to assist patient selection and
treatment adjustment in PULSAR.

Motivation: 传统EEG睡眠监测设备虽然准确但笨重不便，限制了在家庭环境等真实场景中的长期连续监测应用。耳内EEG设备可以提供无创、舒适的睡眠监测解决方案

Method: 使用定制耳塞设备，在一只耳朵中使用干式耳尖电极作为测量电极，另一只耳朵作为参考电极。通过11名参与者的睡眠研究，使用Apple Watch Ultra获取真实睡眠阶段标签，采用留一法交叉验证

Result: 系统在二元睡眠检测（清醒vs睡眠）上达到90.5%准确率，在四分类睡眠分期（清醒、REM、核心睡眠、深度睡眠）上达到65.1%准确率

Conclusion: 耳内电极作为一种低负担、舒适的睡眠监测方法具有巨大潜力，特别适用于如检测入睡后自动暂停媒体播放等消费级应用

Abstract: Automatic sleep staging typically relies on gold-standard EEG setups, which
are accurate but obtrusive and impractical for everyday use outside sleep
laboratories. This limits applicability in real-world settings, such as home
environments, where continuous, long-term monitoring is needed. Detecting sleep
onset is particularly relevant, enabling consumer applications (e.g.
automatically pausing media playback when the user falls asleep). Recent
research has shown correlations between in-ear EEG and full-scalp EEG for
various phenomena, suggesting wearable, in-ear devices could allow unobtrusive
sleep monitoring. We investigated the feasibility of using single-channel
in-ear electrophysiological (ExG) signals for automatic sleep staging in a
wearable device by conducting a sleep study with 11~participants (mean age:
24), using a custom earpiece with a dry eartip electrode (D\"atwyler SoftPulse)
as a measurement electrode in one ear and a reference in the other. Ground
truth sleep stages were obtained from an Apple Watch Ultra, validated for sleep
staging. Our system achieved 90.5% accuracy for binary sleep detection (Awake
vs. Asleep) and 65.1% accuracy for four-class staging (Awake, REM, Core, Deep)
using leave-one-subject-out validation. These findings demonstrate the
potential of in-ear electrodes as a low-effort, comfortable approach to sleep
monitoring, with applications such as stopping podcasts when users fall asleep.

Conclusion: 该方法在理论和实证上都表现出色，提供了适应动态环境的有效解决方案，模块化架构为未来扩展和定制提供了灵活性。

Abstract: This paper investigates the problem of Online Convex-Concave Optimization,
which extends Online Convex Optimization to two-player time-varying
convex-concave games. The goal is to minimize the dynamic duality gap (D-DGap),
a critical performance measure that evaluates players' strategies against
arbitrary comparator sequences. Existing algorithms fail to deliver optimal
performance, particularly in stationary or predictable environments. To address
this, we propose a novel modular algorithm with three core components: an
Adaptive Module that dynamically adjusts to varying levels of non-stationarity,
a Multi-Predictor Aggregator that identifies the best predictor among multiple
candidates, and an Integration Module that effectively combines their
strengths. Our algorithm achieves a minimax optimal D-DGap upper bound, up to a
logarithmic factor, while also ensuring prediction error-driven D-DGap bounds.
The modular design allows for the seamless replacement of components that
regulate adaptability to dynamic environments, as well as the incorporation of
components that integrate ``side knowledge'' from multiple predictors.
Empirical results further demonstrate the effectiveness and adaptability of the
proposed method.

democratize AI development and enabling sustainable computing.
  In this paper, we present Bio-KGvec2go, an extension of the KGvec2go Web API,

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are large-scale pretrained models that have
achieved remarkable success across diverse domains. These successes have been
driven by unprecedented complexity and scale in both data and computations.
However, due to the high costs of training such models, brute-force
trial-and-error approaches to improve LLMs are not feasible. Inspired by the
success of inverse problems in uncovering fundamental scientific laws, this
position paper advocates that inverse problems can also efficiently uncover
scaling laws that guide the building of LLMs to achieve the desirable
performance with significantly better cost-effectiveness.

Motivation: 传统多任务世界模型在处理大规模异构环境时面临梯度冲突和模型可塑性损失的问题，限制了样本和计算效率。

Abstract: In heterogeneous multi-task learning, tasks not only exhibit diverse
observation and action spaces but also vary substantially in intrinsic
difficulty. While conventional multi-task world models like UniZero excel in
single-task settings, we find that when handling large-scale heterogeneous
environments, gradient conflicts and the loss of model plasticity often
constrain their sample and computational efficiency. In this work, we address
these challenges from two perspectives: the single learning iteration and the
overall learning process. First, we investigate the impact of key design spaces
on extending UniZero to multi-task planning. We find that a Mixture-of-Experts
(MoE) architecture provides the most substantial performance gains by
mitigating gradient conflicts, leading to our proposed model,
\textit{ScaleZero}. Second, to dynamically balance the computational load
across the learning process, we introduce an online, LoRA-based \textit{dynamic
parameter scaling} (DPS) strategy. This strategy progressively integrates LoRA
adapters in response to task-specific progress, enabling adaptive knowledge
retention and parameter expansion. Empirical evaluations on standard benchmarks
such as Atari, DMControl (DMC), and Jericho demonstrate that ScaleZero, relying
exclusively on online reinforcement learning with one model, attains
performance on par with specialized single-task baselines. Furthermore, when
augmented with our dynamic parameter scaling strategy, our method achieves
competitive performance while requiring only 80\% of the single-task
environment interaction steps. These findings underscore the potential of
ScaleZero for effective large-scale multi-task learning. Our code is available

enable collaborative, privacy-preserving training across decentralized
institutions while accommodating diverse modalities and tasks. Subsequently,
this position paper aims to unveil M3T FedFMs as a promising yet underexplored
approach to the education community, explore its potentials, and reveal its
related future research directions. We outline how M3T FedFMs can advance three
critical pillars of next-generation intelligent education systems: (i) privacy
preservation, by keeping sensitive multi-modal student and institutional data
local; (ii) personalization, through modular architectures enabling tailored
models for students, instructors, and institutions; and (iii) equity and
inclusivity, by facilitating participation from underrepresented and
resource-constrained entities. We finally identify various open research
challenges, including studying of (i) inter-institution heterogeneous privacy
regulations, (ii) the non-uniformity of data modalities' characteristics, (iii)
the unlearning approaches for M3T FedFMs, (iv) the continual learning
frameworks for M3T FedFMs, and (v) M3T FedFM model interpretability, which must
be collectively addressed for practical deployment.

*Oliver Daniels,Stuart Armstrong,Alexandre Maranhão,Mahirah Fairuz Rahman,Benjamin M. Marlin,Rebecca Gorman*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ACE方法通过自训练学习概念集合来解决完全伪相关性问题，在多个基准测试中表现优异，且具有更好的可配置性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络对伪相关性敏感，现有方法主要处理不完全伪相关，但完全伪相关情况下的正确泛化是根本未指定的问题

Method: 使用自训练方法学习一组与训练数据一致但在新未标记输入上做出不同预测的概念，通过鼓励自信和选择性分歧来实现

Result: ACE在完全伪相关基准测试中匹配或优于现有方法，同时保持对不完全伪相关的鲁棒性，在语言模型对齐应用中表现竞争性

Conclusion: ACE在克服未指定问题方面取得显著进展，虽然仍有重要限制，但为处理完全伪相关问题提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Deep neural networks are notoriously sensitive to spurious correlations -
where a model learns a shortcut that fails out-of-distribution. Existing work
on spurious correlations has often focused on incomplete
correlations,leveraging access to labeled instances that break the correlation.
But in cases where the spurious correlations are complete, the correct
generalization is fundamentally \textit{underspecified}. To resolve this
underspecification, we propose learning a set of concepts that are consistent
with training data but make distinct predictions on a subset of novel unlabeled
inputs. Using a self-training approach that encourages \textit{confident} and
\textit{selective} disagreement, our method ACE matches or outperforms existing
methods on a suite of complete-spurious correlation benchmarks, while remaining
robust to incomplete spurious correlations. ACE is also more configurable than
prior approaches, allowing for straight-forward encoding of prior knowledge and
principled unsupervised model selection. In an early application to
language-model alignment, we find that ACE achieves competitive performance on
the measurement tampering detection benchmark \textit{without} access to
untrusted measurements. While still subject to important limitations, ACE
represents significant progress towards overcoming underspecification.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了基于Block Tensor-Train (BTT)和Multi-Level Low Rank (MLR)矩阵的新评分函数，解决了标准注意力机制在高维输入信息丢失和缺乏距离依赖性计算偏置的问题，在多个任务上表现优于标准注意力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准注意力机制的低维投影会导致高维输入信息丢失，且对所有输入对使用相同的评分函数，缺乏对序列中相邻token的距离依赖性计算偏置。

Method: 使用计算高效的结构化矩阵（BTT和MLR）构建新的评分函数，这些矩阵具有高秩特性，能够编码全秩或距离依赖性的计算偏置。

Result: 在高维输入的上下文回归任务中，在固定计算预算下优于标准注意力；在语言建模任务中，MLR注意力相比标准注意力和滑动窗口注意力变体实现了更好的缩放规律；在长程时间序列预测中也显示出有希望的结果。

Conclusion: BTT和MLR属于一个更广泛的能够编码全秩或距离依赖性计算偏置的高效结构化矩阵家族，有效解决了标准注意力的重要缺陷。

Abstract: The core component of attention is the scoring function, which transforms the
inputs into low-dimensional queries and keys and takes the dot product of each
pair. While the low-dimensional projection improves efficiency, it causes
information loss for certain tasks that have intrinsically high-dimensional
inputs. Additionally, attention uses the same scoring function for all input
pairs, without imposing a distance-dependent compute bias for neighboring
tokens in the sequence. In this work, we address these shortcomings by
proposing new scoring functions based on computationally efficient structured
matrices with high ranks, including Block Tensor-Train (BTT) and Multi-Level
Low Rank (MLR) matrices. On in-context regression tasks with high-dimensional
inputs, our proposed scoring functions outperform standard attention for any
fixed compute budget. On language modeling, a task that exhibits locality
patterns, our MLR-based attention method achieves improved scaling laws
compared to both standard attention and variants of sliding window attention.
Additionally, we show that both BTT and MLR fall under a broader family of
efficient structured matrices capable of encoding either full-rank or
distance-dependent compute biases, thereby addressing significant shortcomings
of standard attention. Finally, we show that MLR attention has promising
results for long-range time-series forecasting.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 学习率预热是训练大规模深度神经网络的实用技术，但其理论优势尚未得到充分理解，需要弥合理论与实践之间的差距。

Method: 提出新的广义光滑性假设家族，在确定性和随机设置下研究梯度下降的收敛性质，分析学习率预热对收敛速度的影响。

Result: 学习率预热一致加速梯度下降，在某些特定情况下，预热学习率的收敛速度可比非递增学习率计划快Θ(T)倍。

Conclusion: 从优化理论角度提供了学习率预热策略的理论依据，证明了其在加速收敛方面的有效性。

Abstract: Learning rate warmup is a popular and practical technique in training
large-scale deep neural networks. Despite the huge success in practice, the
theoretical advantages of this strategy of gradually increasing the learning
rate at the beginning of the training process have not been fully understood.
To resolve this gap between theory and practice, we first propose a novel
family of generalized smoothness assumptions, and validate its applicability
both theoretically and empirically. Under the novel smoothness assumption, we
study the convergence properties of gradient descent (GD) in both deterministic
and stochastic settings. It is shown that learning rate warmup consistently
accelerates GD, and GD with warmup can converge at most $\Theta(T)$ times
faster than with a non-increasing learning rate schedule in some specific
cases, providing insights into the benefits of this strategy from an
optimization theory perspective.

*Fernando Spadea,Oshani Seneviratne*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种轻量级的神经符号框架，通过在推理时适应用户知识图来减少LLM推荐系统中的过度个性化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LLM推荐系统中的过度个性化问题，即算法导致的过滤氛氛现象，这会限制内容的多样性。

Method: 通过重组用户个性化知识图(PKG)来压制特征共现模式，使用软重新权重、硬反转和有偏见三元组删除等符号适应策略，构建结构化提示来导向更多样化的推荐。

Result: 在菜谱推荐标准数据集上的实验显示，个性化PKG适应显著提高了内容新颖度，同时保持推荐质量，效果超过全局适应和简单提示方法。

Conclusion: 该轻量级神经符号框架能够有效减少LLM推荐系统中的过度个性化问题，在保持相关性的同时提高内容多样性。

Abstract: We present a lightweight neuro-symbolic framework to mitigate
over-personalization in LLM-based recommender systems by adapting user-side
Knowledge Graphs (KGs) at inference time. Instead of retraining models or
relying on opaque heuristics, our method restructures a user's Personalized
Knowledge Graph (PKG) to suppress feature co-occurrence patterns that reinforce
Personalized Information Environments (PIEs), i.e., algorithmically induced
filter bubbles that constrain content diversity. These adapted PKGs are used to
construct structured prompts that steer the language model toward more diverse,
Out-PIE recommendations while preserving topical relevance. We introduce a
family of symbolic adaptation strategies, including soft reweighting, hard
inversion, and targeted removal of biased triples, and a client-side learning
algorithm that optimizes their application per user. Experiments on a recipe
recommendation benchmark show that personalized PKG adaptations significantly
increase content novelty while maintaining recommendation quality,
outperforming global adaptation and naive prompt-based methods.

*Haike Xu,Tong Chen*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: Reranker-Guided-Search (RGS) 通过直接根据重排序器偏好检索文档来突破传统检索-重排序管道的限制，在有限的重排序预算下显著提升检索准确性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统检索-重排序管道存在两个关键限制：受限于初始检索质量，以及LLM重排序器计算需求增长限制了可处理文档数量

Method: 使用近似最近邻算法生成的邻近图进行贪婪搜索，基于文档相似性策略性地优先选择有前景的文档进行重排序

Result: 在多个基准测试中取得显著性能提升：BRIGHT提升3.5分，FollowIR提升2.9分，M-BEIR提升5.1分，且重排序预算限制在100个文档内

Conclusion: 在固定的嵌入和重排序模型对下，策略性地选择重排序文档可以在有限的重排序预算下显著提高检索准确性

Abstract: The widely used retrieve-and-rerank pipeline faces two critical limitations:
they are constrained by the initial retrieval quality of the top-k documents,
and the growing computational demands of LLM-based rerankers restrict the
number of documents that can be effectively processed. We introduce
Reranker-Guided-Search (RGS), a novel approach that bypasses these limitations
by directly retrieving documents according to reranker preferences rather than
following the traditional sequential reranking method. Our method uses a greedy
search on proximity graphs generated by approximate nearest neighbor
algorithms, strategically prioritizing promising documents for reranking based
on document similarity. Experimental results demonstrate substantial
performance improvements across multiple benchmarks: 3.5 points on BRIGHT, 2.9
on FollowIR, and 5.1 on M-BEIR, all within a constrained reranker budget of 100
documents. Our analysis suggests that, given a fixed pair of embedding and
reranker models, strategically selecting documents to rerank can significantly
improve retrieval accuracy under limited reranker budget.

TL;DR: 这篇论文构建了一个多样化的复杂检索任务集合，用于评估检索模型在复杂实际检索任务中的能力，并发现即使最好的模型也面临显著挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型的发展，人们对检索系统的期望趋向复杂化，需要处理包含多部分、约束条件或要求的自然语言查询。然而目前缺乏评估检索模型在复杂任务上能力的综合性资源。

Method: 构建了一个多样化且实际的复杂检索任务集合，对代表性的独创检索模型进行基准测试，并探索基于LLM的查询扩展和重写对检索质量的影响。

Result: 结果显示即使最好的模型也在复杂检索任务中表现差强，平均nDCG@10仅为0.346，R@100仅为0.587。LLM增强虽然可以帮助较弱模型，但对最强模型的性能有所下降。

Conclusion: 复杂检索任务对当前的检索模型构成了重大挑战，需要新一代检索模型的发展来应对这些实际需求，而传统的LLM增强技术并不能有效解决这些问题。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are incredible and versatile tools for
text-based tasks that have enabled countless, previously unimaginable,
applications. Retrieval models, in contrast, have not yet seen such capable
general-purpose models emerge. To achieve this goal, retrieval models must be
able to perform complex retrieval tasks, where queries contain multiple parts,
constraints, or requirements in natural language. These tasks represent a
natural progression from the simple, single-aspect queries that are used in the
vast majority of existing, commonly used evaluation sets. Complex queries
naturally arise as people expect search systems to handle more specific and
often ambitious information requests, as is demonstrated by how people use
LLM-based information systems. Despite the growing desire for retrieval models
to expand their capabilities in complex retrieval tasks, there exist limited
resources to assess the ability of retrieval models on a comprehensive set of
diverse complex tasks. The few resources that do exist feature a limited scope
and often lack realistic settings making it hard to know the true capabilities
of retrieval models on complex real-world retrieval tasks. To address this
shortcoming and spur innovation in next-generation retrieval models, we
construct a diverse and realistic set of complex retrieval tasks and benchmark
a representative set of state-of-the-art retrieval models. Additionally, we
explore the impact of LLM-based query expansion and rewriting on retrieval
quality. Our results show that even the best models struggle to produce
high-quality retrieval results with the highest average nDCG@10 of only 0.346
and R@100 of only 0.587 across all tasks. Although LLM augmentation can help
weaker models, the strongest model has decreased performance across all metrics
with all rewriting techniques.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 个性化AI系统（如推荐系统和聊天机器人）可能向用户暴露敏感或有害内容，影响用户福祉，需要定量评估这些系统的负面影响。

Method: 创建了两个数据集：一个整合MovieLens评分数据和Does the Dog Die?网站的内容警告，另一个结合Archive of Our Own的同人小说互动数据和用户生成的警告标签。

Result: 开发了两个包含敏感度分类标签和用户-内容评分的新型数据集，为研究人员提供了评估个性化系统潜在危害的工具。

Conclusion: 这些数据集使研究人员能够超越传统的参与度指标，定量评估个性化AI系统对用户福祉的潜在负面影响。

Abstract: Personalized AI systems, from recommendation systems to chatbots, are a
prevalent method for distributing content to users based on their learned
preferences. However, there is growing concern about the adverse effects of
these systems, including their potential tendency to expose users to sensitive
or harmful material, negatively impacting overall well-being. To address this
concern quantitatively, it is necessary to create datasets with relevant
sensitivity labels for content, enabling researchers to evaluate personalized
systems beyond mere engagement metrics. To this end, we introduce two novel
datasets that include a taxonomy of sensitivity labels alongside user-content
ratings: one that integrates MovieLens rating data with content warnings from
the Does the Dog Die? community ratings website, and another that combines
fan-fiction interaction data and user-generated warnings from Archive of Our
Own.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: MEGG是一个基于经验回放的增量学习框架，通过GGscore指标选择高影响力样本进行回放，解决推荐系统中神经协同过滤模型的灾难性遗忘问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有神经协同过滤模型通常在静态设置下训练，假设数据分布固定，无法适应动态环境中用户偏好的演化。增量学习虽然很有前景，但传统方法在推荐任务中面临数据稀疏性和任务范式差异的挑战。

Method: 提出MEGG框架，引入GGscore指标量化样本影响力，选择性回放高影响力样本来缓解灾难性遗忘。该方法是模型无关的，可无缝集成到各种架构和框架中。

Result: 在三个神经模型和四个基准数据集上的实验表明，MEGG在性能上优于最先进的基线方法，具有强大的可扩展性、效率和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: MEGG为解决推荐系统中神经模型的增量学习问题提供了一个有效且通用的解决方案，能够很好地适应动态环境中的用户偏好变化。

Abstract: Neural Collaborative Filtering models are widely used in recommender systems
but are typically trained under static settings, assuming fixed data
distributions. This limits their applicability in dynamic environments where
user preferences evolve. Incremental learning offers a promising solution, yet
conventional methods from computer vision or NLP face challenges in
recommendation tasks due to data sparsity and distinct task paradigms. Existing
approaches for neural recommenders remain limited and often lack
generalizability. To address this, we propose MEGG, Replay Samples with
Maximally Extreme GGscore, an experience replay based incremental learning
framework. MEGG introduces GGscore, a novel metric that quantifies sample
influence, enabling the selective replay of highly influential samples to
mitigate catastrophic forgetting. Being model-agnostic, MEGG integrates
seamlessly across architectures and frameworks. Experiments on three neural
models and four benchmark datasets show superior performance over
state-of-the-art baselines, with strong scalability, efficiency, and
robustness. Implementation will be released publicly upon acceptance.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: MVP是一种基于非生成式大语言模型的段落重排序方法，通过多视图嵌入和正交损失来解决传统LLM方法在效率和外部偏见方面的问题，在保持高性能的同时大幅降低推理延迟。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于大语言模型的段落重排序方法存在两个主要问题：(1)自回归生成和滑动窗口策略导致计算开销大，效率低下；(2)外部偏见（如位置偏见和选择偏见）影响模型准确表示段落的能力并增加输入顺序敏感性。

Method: 提出MVP模型，采用非生成式方法将查询-段落信息编码为多样化的视图嵌入，不受外部偏见影响。为每个视图生成独特的锚向量，直接计算相关性分数，并使用正交损失使视图更加区分。

Result: MVP仅用2.2亿参数就能达到70亿参数微调模型的性能，推理延迟降低100倍。30亿参数版本在域内和域外基准测试中都达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: MVP通过创新的多视图引导方法有效解决了LLM在段落重排序中的效率和偏见问题，证明了小参数模型也能实现优异性能，为高效重排序提供了新思路。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have shown impressive
performance in passage reranking tasks. Despite their success, LLM-based
methods still face challenges in efficiency and sensitivity to external biases.
(1) Existing models rely mostly on autoregressive generation and sliding window
strategies to rank passages, which incur heavy computational overhead as the
number of passages increases. (2) External biases, such as position or
selection bias, hinder the model's ability to accurately represent passages and
increase input-order sensitivity. To address these limitations, we introduce a
novel passage reranking model, called Multi-View-guided Passage Reranking
(MVP). MVP is a non-generative LLM-based reranking method that encodes
query-passage information into diverse view embeddings without being influenced
by external biases. For each view, it combines query-aware passage embeddings
to produce a distinct anchor vector, which is then used to directly compute
relevance scores in a single decoding step. In addition, it employs an
orthogonal loss to make the views more distinctive. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that MVP, with just 220M parameters, matches the performance of
much larger 7B-scale fine-tuned models while achieving a 100x reduction in
inference latency. Notably, the 3B-parameter variant of MVP achieves
state-of-the-art performance on both in-domain and out-of-domain benchmarks.

TL;DR: FLeW是一个统一对比学习、细粒度表示学习和任务感知学习的科学文档表示学习方法，通过引用意图和频率增强训练信号，实现领域泛化的多面表示，无需任务特定微调即可适应不同任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前科学文档表示学习方法存在三个问题：1)对比学习未充分利用引用信息且生成单向量表示；2)细粒度表示学习需要昂贵整合且缺乏领域泛化；3)任务感知学习依赖预定义任务分类且需要额外训练数据。

Method: 提出新颖的三元组采样方法，利用引用意图(背景、方法、结果)和频率增强引用结构信号；基于科学写作通用结构进行领域泛化的面划分；采用简单权重搜索自适应整合三个面级嵌入为任务特定文档嵌入，无需任务感知微调。

Result: 实验表明FLeW在多个科学任务和领域中相比先前模型具有更好的适用性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: FLeW成功统一了三种表示学习方法，通过引用意图驱动的面划分和自适应权重整合，实现了更好的科学文档表示效果。

Abstract: Scientific document representation learning provides powerful embeddings for
various tasks, while current methods face challenges across three approaches.
1) Contrastive training with citation-structural signals underutilizes citation
information and still generates single-vector representations. 2) Fine-grained
representation learning, which generates multiple vectors at the sentence or
aspect level, requires costly integration and lacks domain generalization. 3)
Task-aware learning depends on manually predefined task categorization,
overlooking nuanced task distinctions and requiring extra training data for
task-specific modules. To address these problems, we propose a new method that
unifies the three approaches for better representations, namely FLeW.
Specifically, we introduce a novel triplet sampling method that leverages
citation intent and frequency to enhance citation-structural signals for
training. Citation intents (background, method, result), aligned with the
general structure of scientific writing, facilitate a domain-generalized facet
partition for fine-grained representation learning. Then, we adopt a simple
weight search to adaptively integrate three facet-level embeddings into a
task-specific document embedding without task-aware fine-tuning. Experiments
show the applicability and robustness of FLeW across multiple scientific tasks
and fields, compared to prior models.

Motivation: 传统CTR模型能捕捉表格数据的协同信号但缺乏文本语义理解，而LLM擅长文本理解但难以捕获协同信号且推理延迟高。需要结合两者的优势，实现协同、语义和效率的平衡。

Method: 使用伪孪生网络，包含增益网络（注入LLM生成的高层表示向量到协同CTR模型）和普通网络（仅输入表格数据）。通过分数级和表示级的知识蒸馏，使普通网络能达到增益网络的性能。

Result: 在真实数据集上的实验证明了ELEC在CTR预测中的有效性和效率。

Conclusion: ELEC框架成功结合了LLM的语义理解能力和传统CTR模型的协同信号捕获优势，通过知识蒸馏实现了高效推理，是模型无关的可扩展解决方案。

Abstract: Click-through rate (CTR) prediction plays an important role in online
advertising systems. On the one hand, traditional CTR prediction models capture
the collaborative signals in tabular data via feature interaction modeling, but
they lose semantics in text. On the other hand, Large Language Models (LLMs)
excel in understanding the context and meaning behind text, but they face
challenges in capturing collaborative signals and they have long inference
latency. In this paper, we aim to leverage the benefits of both types of models
and pursue collaboration, semantics and efficiency. We present ELEC, which is
an Efficient LLM-Empowered CTR prediction framework. We first adapt an LLM for
the CTR prediction task. In order to leverage the ability of the LLM but
simultaneously keep efficiency, we utilize the pseudo-siamese network which
contains a gain network and a vanilla network. We inject the high-level
representation vector generated by the LLM into a collaborative CTR model to
form the gain network such that it can take advantage of both tabular modeling
and textual modeling. However, its reliance on the LLM limits its efficiency.
We then distill the knowledge from the gain network to the vanilla network on
both the score level and the representation level, such that the vanilla
network takes only tabular data as input, but can still generate comparable
performance as the gain network. Our approach is model-agnostic. It allows for
the integration with various existing LLMs and collaborative CTR models.
Experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency
of ELEC for CTR prediction.

Abstract: The proliferation of long-form documents presents a fundamental challenge to
information retrieval (IR), as their length, dispersed evidence, and complex
structures demand specialized methods beyond standard passage-level techniques.
This survey provides the first comprehensive treatment of long-document

techniques. Beyond the models, we review domain-specific applications,
specialized evaluation resources, and outline critical open challenges such as

to provide both a consolidated reference and a forward-looking agenda for
advancing long-document retrieval in the era of foundation models.

Abstract: Modern information retrieval (IR) must bridge short, ambiguous queries and
ever more diverse, rapidly evolving corpora. Query Expansion (QE) remains a key
mechanism for mitigating vocabulary mismatch, but the design space has shifted
markedly with pre-trained language models (PLMs) and large language models
(LLMs). This survey synthesizes the field from three angles: (i) a
four-dimensional framework of query expansion - from the point of injection
(explicit vs. implicit QE), through grounding and interaction (knowledge bases,
model-internal capabilities, multi-turn retrieval) and learning alignment, to
knowledge graph-based argumentation; (ii) a model-centric taxonomy spanning
encoder-only, encoder-decoder, decoder-only, instruction-tuned, and
domain/multilingual variants, highlighting their characteristic affordances for
QE (contextual disambiguation, controllable generation, zero-/few-shot
reasoning); and (iii) practice-oriented guidance on where and how neural QE
helps in first-stage retrieval, multi-query fusion, re-ranking, and
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). We compare traditional query expansion
with PLM/LLM-based methods across seven key aspects, and we map applications
across web search, biomedicine, e-commerce, open-domain QA/RAG, conversational
and code search, and cross-lingual settings. The review distills design
grounding and interaction, alignment/distillation (SFT/PEFT/DPO), and KG
constraints - as robust remedies to topic drift and hallucination. We conclude
with an agenda on quality control, cost-aware invocation, domain/temporal
adaptation, evaluation beyond end-task metrics, and fairness/privacy.
Collectively, these insights provide a principled blueprint for selecting and
combining QE techniques under real-world constraints.

Abstract: Effectively managing intellectual property is a significant challenge.
Traditional methods for patent analysis depend on labor-intensive manual
searches and rigid keyword matching. These approaches are often inefficient and
struggle to reveal the complex relationships hidden within large patent
datasets, hindering strategic decision-making. To overcome these limitations,
we introduce KLIPA, a novel framework that leverages a knowledge graph and a
large language model (LLM) to significantly advance patent analysis. Our
approach integrates three key components: a structured knowledge graph to map
explicit relationships between patents, a retrieval-augmented generation(RAG)
system to uncover contextual connections, and an intelligent agent that
dynamically determines the optimal strategy for resolving user queries. We
validated KLIPA on a comprehensive, real-world patent database, where it
demonstrated substantial improvements in knowledge extraction, discovery of
novel connections, and overall operational efficiency. This combination of
technologies enhances retrieval accuracy, reduces reliance on domain experts,
and provides a scalable, automated solution for any organization managing
intellectual property, including technology corporations and legal firms,
allowing them to better navigate the complexities of strategic innovation and
competitive intelligence.

Abstract: Multi-criteria decision-making methods provide decision-makers with
appropriate tools to make better decisions in uncertain, complex, and
conflicting situations. Fuzzy set theory primarily deals with the uncertainty
inherent in human thoughts and perceptions and attempts to quantify this
uncertainty. Fuzzy logic and fuzzy set theory are utilized with multi-criteria
decision-making methods because they effectively handle uncertainty and
fuzziness in decision-makers' judgments, allowing for verbal judgments of the
problem. This study utilizes the Fermatean fuzzy environment, a generalization
of fuzzy sets. An optimization model based on the deviation maximization method
is proposed to determine partially known feature weights. This method is
combined with interval-valued Fermatean fuzzy sets. The proposed method was
applied to the problem of selecting renewable energy sources. The reason for
choosing renewable energy sources is that meeting energy needs from renewable
sources, balancing carbon emissions, and mitigating the effects of global
climate change are among the most critical issues of the recent period. Even
though selecting renewable energy sources is a technical issue, the managerial
and political implications of this issue are also important, and are discussed
in this study.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Spectral NSR是一个完全谱的神经符号推理框架，通过图信号处理和拉普拉斯特征结构将逻辑规则嵌入为谱模板，在谱域直接进行推理，统一了符号推理的可解释性和谱学习的可扩展性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决传统推理方法在可解释性、可扩展性和适应性方面的局限性，作者希望开发一个能够结合符号推理的透明性和谱学习的高效性的统一框架。

Method: 利用图信号处理(GSP)和基于知识图谱拉普拉斯特征结构的频率选择性滤波器，将逻辑规则嵌入为谱模板。包含动态图和基学习、有理和扩散滤波器、谱专家混合、证明引导训练、不确定性量化等扩展功能。

Result: 在ProofWriter和CLUTRR等推理基准测试中，Spectral NSR相比transformer、消息传递神经网络和神经符号逻辑编程系统等基线方法，实现了更高的准确性、更快的推理速度、更好的对抗扰动鲁棒性和更高的可解释性。

Conclusion: Spectral NSR为下一代推理系统提供了一个可扩展且原则性的基础，提供了超越传统方法的透明度、鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Abstract: We introduce Spectral NSR, a fully spectral neuro-symbolic reasoning
framework that embeds logical rules as spectral templates and performs
inference directly in the graph spectral domain. By leveraging graph signal
processing (GSP) and frequency-selective filters grounded in the Laplacian
eigenstructure of knowledge graphs, the architecture unifies the
interpretability of symbolic reasoning with the scalability and adaptability of
spectral learning. Beyond the core formulation, we incorporate a comprehensive
set of extensions, including dynamic graph and basis learning, rational and
diffusion filters for sharper spectral selectivity, mixture-of-spectral-experts
for modular specialization, proof-guided training with spectral curricula, and
uncertainty quantification for calibrated confidence. Additional enhancements
such as large language model coupling, co-spectral transfer alignment,
adversarial robustness, efficient GPU kernels, generalized Laplacians, and
causal interventions further expand the versatility of the framework.
  Empirical evaluation on state-of-the-art reasoning benchmarks such as
ProofWriter and CLUTRR demonstrates that Spectral NSR achieves superior
accuracy, faster inference, improved robustness to adversarial perturbations,
and higher interpretability compared to leading baselines including
transformers, message-passing neural networks, and neuro-symbolic logic
programming systems. Spectral attribution and proof-band agreement analyses
confirm that model decisions align closely with symbolic proof structures,
while transfer experiments validate effective domain adaptation through
co-spectral alignment. These results establish Spectral NSR as a scalable and
principled foundation for the next generation of reasoning systems, offering
transparency, robustness, and generalization beyond conventional approaches.

Motivation: 当前GUI代理在处理新颖UI元素、长时程动作和个性化轨迹的复杂任务时仍存在困难，需要更可靠的解决方案。

Method: 利用单次专家演示提取逐步指令，严格遵循用户轨迹执行，并配备验证器和回溯器模块来处理意外中断和验证执行结果。

Result: 在OSWorld任务集上达到60%的成功率，而所有顶级代理都未能完成这些任务。

Conclusion: Instruction Agent提供了一个实用且可扩展的框架，弥合了当前GUI代理与可靠真实世界GUI任务自动化之间的差距。

Abstract: Graphical user interface (GUI) agents have advanced rapidly but still
struggle with complex tasks involving novel UI elements, long-horizon actions,
and personalized trajectories. In this work, we introduce Instruction Agent, a
GUI agent that leverages expert demonstrations to solve such tasks, enabling
completion of otherwise difficult workflows. Given a single demonstration, the
agent extracts step-by-step instructions and executes them by strictly
following the trajectory intended by the user, which avoids making mistakes
during execution. The agent leverages the verifier and backtracker modules
further to improve robustness. Both modules are critical to understand the
current outcome from each action and handle unexpected interruptions(such as
pop-up windows) during execution. Our experiments show that Instruction Agent
achieves a 60% success rate on a set of tasks in OSWorld that all top-ranked
agents failed to complete. The Instruction Agent offers a practical and
extensible framework, bridging the gap between current GUI agents and reliable
real-world GUI task automation.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: VISION是一个统一的漏洞检测框架，通过使用大型语言模型生成反事实样本进行对比训练，减少图神经网络的伪相关性学习，提高检测的鲁棒性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于图神经网络的漏洞检测方法存在训练数据不平衡和标签噪声问题，容易学习到代码表面相似性带来的伪相关性，导致在真实数据上泛化性能差。

Method: 使用大型语言模型生成反事实样本（语义最小修改但标签相反），进行针对性图神经网络训练，并结合基于图的解释性分析识别关键代码语句。

Result: 在CWE-20漏洞检测中，整体准确率从51.8%提升到97.8%，对比准确率从4.5%提升到95.8%，最差组准确率从0.7%提升到85.5%。

Conclusion: VISION框架有效减少了伪相关性学习，提高了漏洞检测的鲁棒性和可解释性，为构建透明可信的AI网络安全系统提供了新方法。

Abstract: Automated detection of vulnerabilities in source code is an essential
cybersecurity challenge, underpinning trust in digital systems and services.
Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as a promising approach as they can
learn structural and logical code relationships in a data-driven manner.
However, their performance is severely constrained by training data imbalances
and label noise. GNNs often learn 'spurious' correlations from superficial code
similarities, producing detectors that fail to generalize well to unseen
real-world data. In this work, we propose a unified framework for robust and
interpretable vulnerability detection, called VISION, to mitigate spurious
correlations by systematically augmenting a counterfactual training dataset.
Counterfactuals are samples with minimal semantic modifications but opposite
labels. Our framework includes: (i) generating counterfactuals by prompting a
Large Language Model (LLM); (ii) targeted GNN training on paired code examples
with opposite labels; and (iii) graph-based interpretability to identify the
crucial code statements relevant for vulnerability predictions while ignoring
spurious ones. We find that VISION reduces spurious learning and enables more
robust, generalizable detection, improving overall accuracy (from 51.8% to
97.8%), pairwise contrast accuracy (from 4.5% to 95.8%), and worst-group
accuracy (from 0.7% to 85.5%) on the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE)-20
vulnerability. We further demonstrate gains using proposed metrics: intra-class
attribution variance, inter-class attribution distance, and node score
dependency. We also release CWE-20-CFA, a benchmark of 27,556 functions (real
and counterfactual) from the high-impact CWE-20 category. Finally, VISION
advances transparent and trustworthy AI-based cybersecurity systems through
interactive visualization for human-in-the-loop analysis.

Abstract: Neurosymbolic (NeSy) frameworks combine neural representations and learning
with symbolic representations and reasoning. Combining the reasoning
capacities, explainability, and interpretability of symbolic processing with
the flexibility and power of neural computing allows us to solve complex
problems with more reliability while being data-efficient. However, this
recently growing topic poses a challenge to developers with its learning curve,
lack of user-friendly tools, libraries, and unifying frameworks. In this paper,
we characterize the technical facets of existing NeSy frameworks, such as the
symbolic representation language, integration with neural models, and the
underlying algorithms. A majority of the NeSy research focuses on algorithms
instead of providing generic frameworks for declarative problem specification
to leverage problem solving. To highlight the key aspects of Neurosymbolic
modeling, we showcase three generic NeSy frameworks - \textit{DeepProbLog},
\textit{Scallop}, and \textit{DomiKnowS}. We identify the challenges within
each facet that lay the foundation for identifying the expressivity of each
framework in solving a variety of problems. Building on this foundation, we aim
to spark transformative action and encourage the community to rethink this
problem in novel ways.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于一维卷积自编码器和LSTM的深度学习方法来去除皮肤神经活动(SKNA)信号中的肌电(EMG)噪声干扰，显著提高了信号质量和对交感神经活动的监测能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 皮肤神经活动(SKNA)是监测交感神经系统的重要非侵入性指标，但容易受到肌电(EMG)污染，特别是在肌肉活动时传统滤波方法效果有限。

Method: 使用轻量级一维卷积自编码器配合LSTM瓶颈层，从EMG污染的SKNA记录中重建干净的信号。采用留一交叉验证框架，使用认知压力实验的干净SKNA数据和肌肉刺激记录的EMG噪声进行训练。

Result: 方法将信噪比提高了9.65dB，与干净SKNA的互相关系数从0.40提升到0.72，基于爆发的SKNA特征判别能力接近干净数据水平(AUROC≥0.96)，在严重噪声水平下对基线vs交感刺激状态的分类准确率达到91-98%。

Conclusion: 深度学习重建方法能够在显著EMG干扰下保留生理相关的交感神经爆发特征，为在自然运动和活动丰富的环境中进行更稳健的SKNA监测提供了可能。

Abstract: The sympathetic nervous system (SNS) plays a central role in regulating the
body's responses to stress and maintaining physiological stability. Its
dysregulation is associated with a wide range of conditions, from
cardiovascular disease to anxiety disorders. Skin nerve activity (SKNA)
extracted from high-frequency electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings provides a
noninvasive window into SNS dynamics, but its measurement is highly susceptible
to electromyographic (EMG) contamination. Traditional preprocessing based on
bandpass filtering within a fixed range (e.g., 500--1000 Hz) is susceptible to
overlapping EMG and SKNA spectral components, especially during sustained
muscle activity. We present a denoising approach using a lightweight
one-dimensional convolutional autoencoder with a long short-term memory (LSTM)
bottleneck to reconstruct clean SKNA from EMG-contaminated recordings. Using
clean ECG-derived SKNA data from cognitive stress experiments and EMG noise
from chaotic muscle stimulation recordings, we simulated contamination at
realistic noise levels (--4 dB, --8 dB signal-to-noise ratio) and trained the
model in the leave-one-subject-out cross-validation framework. The method
improved signal-to-noise ratio by up to 9.65 dB, increased cross correlation
with clean SKNA from 0.40 to 0.72, and restored burst-based SKNA features to
near-clean discriminability (AUROC $\geq$ 0.96). Classification of baseline
versus sympathetic stimulation (cognitive stress) conditions reached accuracies
of 91--98\% across severe noise levels, comparable to clean data. These results
demonstrate that deep learning--based reconstruction can preserve
physiologically relevant sympathetic bursts during substantial EMG
interference, enabling more robust SKNA monitoring in naturalistic,
movement-rich environments.

Motivation: 每年数百万人寻求法律援助，错误分类会导致严重后果（错过截止日期、遭受虐待、失去住房或子女监护权），需要准确的法律问题分类来匹配正确的法律帮助。

Method: 采用混合LLM/ML集成分类方法，结合自动生成后续问题来丰富初始问题叙述，使用419个真实世界查询数据集进行验证。

Result: 分类准确率（hits@2）达到97.37%，使用低成本模型组合超越了当前最先进的GPT-5模型的性能。

Conclusion: 该方法在显著降低法律系统用户引导成本的同时实现了高准确性，有望改善法律援助服务的匹配效率。

Abstract: Each year millions of people seek help for their legal problems by calling a
legal aid program hotline, walking into a legal aid office, or using a lawyer
referral service. The first step to match them to the right help is to identify
the legal problem the applicant is experiencing. Misdirection has consequences.
Applicants may miss a deadline, experience physical abuse, lose housing or lose
custody of children while waiting to connect to the right legal help. We
introduce and evaluate the FETCH classifier for legal issue classification and
describe two methods for improving accuracy: a hybrid LLM/ML ensemble
classification method, and the automatic generation of follow-up questions to
enrich the initial problem narrative. We employ a novel data set of 419
real-world queries to a nonprofit lawyer referral service. Ultimately, we show
classification accuracy (hits@2) of 97.37\% using a mix of inexpensive models,
exceeding the performance of the current state-of-the-art GPT-5 model. Our
approach shows promise in significantly reducing the cost of guiding users of
the legal system to the right resource for their problem while achieving high

TL;DR: PaVeRL-SQL是一个结合部分匹配奖励和语言强化学习的框架，用于提升文本到SQL模型的性能，在工业级数据库和复杂问题上实现了最先进的结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前文本到SQL方法在工业级数据库和涉及领域特定业务逻辑的复杂问题上执行准确率较低，需要更有效的解决方案来处理实际应用场景。

Method: 采用两种管道：(1)新设计的上下文学习框架与群体自评估(语言强化学习)，使用开源和闭源大语言模型作为骨干；(2)思维链强化学习管道，使用小型骨干模型(OmniSQL-7B)配合专门设计的奖励函数和两阶段强化学习训练。

Result: 在Spider、Spider 2.0和BIRD基准测试中达到最先进水平。在工业级Spider2.0-SQLite基准上，语言强化学习管道比现有最佳方法高7.4%，思维链管道高1.4%。混合SQL方言训练带来三倍增益。

Conclusion: PaVeRL-SQL在现实工业约束下提供了可靠的最先进文本到SQL解决方案，特别适用于训练数据有限的SQL方言场景。

Abstract: Text-to-SQL models allow users to interact with a database more easily by
generating executable SQL statements from natural-language questions. Despite
recent successes on simpler databases and questions, current Text-to-SQL
methods still suffer from low execution accuracy on industry-scale databases
and complex questions involving domain-specific business logic. We present
\emph{PaVeRL-SQL}, a framework that combines \emph{Partial-Match Rewards} and
\emph{Verbal Reinforcement Learning} to drive self-improvement in reasoning
language models (RLMs) for Text-to-SQL. To handle practical use cases, we adopt
two pipelines: (1) a newly designed in-context learning framework with group
self-evaluation (verbal-RL), using capable open- and closed-source large
language models (LLMs) as backbones; and (2) a chain-of-thought (CoT) RL
pipeline with a small backbone model (OmniSQL-7B) trained with a specially
designed reward function and two-stage RL. These pipelines achieve
state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on popular Text-to-SQL benchmarks -- Spider,
Spider 2.0, and BIRD. For the industrial-level Spider2.0-SQLite benchmark, the
verbal-RL pipeline achieves an execution accuracy 7.4\% higher than SOTA, and
the CoT pipeline is 1.4\% higher. RL training with mixed SQL dialects yields
strong, threefold gains, particularly for dialects with limited training data.
Overall, \emph{PaVeRL-SQL} delivers reliable, SOTA Text-to-SQL under realistic
industrial constraints. The code is available at

Abstract: The evolution of the traditional power grid into the "smart grid" has
resulted in a fundamental shift in energy management, which allows the
integration of renewable energy sources with modern communication technology.
However, this interconnection has increased smart grids' vulnerability to
attackers, which might result in privacy breaches, operational interruptions,
and massive outages. The SCADA-based smart grid protocols are critical for
real-time data collection and control, but they are vulnerable to attacks like
unauthorized access and denial of service (DoS). This research proposes a
hybrid deep learning-based Intrusion Detection System (IDS) intended to improve
the cybersecurity of smart grids. The suggested model takes advantage of
Convolutional Neural Networks' (CNN) feature extraction capabilities as well as
Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks' temporal pattern recognition skills.
DNP3 and IEC104 intrusion detection datasets are employed to train and test our
CNN-LSTM model to recognize and classify the potential cyber threats. Compared
to other deep learning approaches, the results demonstrate considerable
improvements in accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, with a detection
accuracy of 99.70%.

Conclusion: BlendedNet为非常规构型提供了宝贵的数据资源，并展示了端到端代理框架在气动预测中的有效性

Abstract: BlendedNet is a publicly available aerodynamic dataset of 999 blended wing
body (BWB) geometries. Each geometry is simulated across about nine flight
conditions, yielding 8830 converged RANS cases with the Spalart-Allmaras model
and 9 to 14 million cells per case. The dataset is generated by sampling
geometric design parameters and flight conditions, and includes detailed
pointwise surface quantities needed to study lift and drag. We also introduce
an end-to-end surrogate framework for pointwise aerodynamic prediction. The
pipeline first uses a permutation-invariant PointNet regressor to predict
geometric parameters from sampled surface point clouds, then conditions a
Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM) network on the predicted parameters and
flight conditions to predict pointwise coefficients Cp, Cfx, and Cfz.
Experiments show low errors in surface predictions across diverse BWBs.
BlendedNet addresses data scarcity for unconventional configurations and
enables research on data-driven surrogate modeling for aerodynamic design.

Abstract: Mobile and wearable healthcare monitoring play a vital role in facilitating
timely interventions, managing chronic health conditions, and ultimately
improving individuals' quality of life. Previous studies on large language
models (LLMs) have highlighted their impressive generalization abilities and
effectiveness in healthcare prediction tasks. However, most LLM-based
healthcare solutions are cloud-based, which raises significant privacy concerns
and results in increased memory usage and latency. To address these challenges,
there is growing interest in compact models, Small Language Models (SLMs),
which are lightweight and designed to run locally and efficiently on mobile and
wearable devices. Nevertheless, how well these models perform in healthcare
prediction remains largely unexplored. We systematically evaluated SLMs on
health prediction tasks using zero-shot, few-shot, and instruction fine-tuning
approaches, and deployed the best performing fine-tuned SLMs on mobile devices
to evaluate their real-world efficiency and predictive performance in practical
healthcare scenarios. Our results show that SLMs can achieve performance
comparable to LLMs while offering substantial gains in efficiency and privacy.
However, challenges remain, particularly in handling class imbalance and
few-shot scenarios. These findings highlight SLMs, though imperfect in their
current form, as a promising solution for next-generation, privacy-preserving
healthcare monitoring.

TL;DR: 中间令牌生成序列长度与问题难度无明显相关性，而是受训练数据分布影响，挑战了将长路径解释为"思考努力"的偏见


<details>

Motivation: 找出中间令牌生成序列长度是否真正反映问题难度，识别其底层机制

Method: 从头训练Transformer模型学习A*搜索算法的演绎迹路，以谋宫问题为实验平台，系统性评估中间令牌长度与真实问题复杂度的关系

Result: 模型在简单问题上也产生过长迹路，中间令牌长度与A*迹路长度仅呈松散相关，相关性仅在近距离训练分布时出现

Conclusion: 中间迹路生成并非适应问题难度，而是受训练数据分布影响，长序列不应自动解释为"思考努力"的标志

Abstract: Intermediate token generation (ITG), where a model produces output before the
solution, has been proposed as a method to improve the performance of language
models on reasoning tasks. While these reasoning traces or Chain of Thoughts
(CoTs) are correlated with performance gains, the mechanisms underlying them
remain unclear. A prevailing assumption in the community has been to
anthropomorphize these tokens as "thinking", treating longer traces as evidence
of higher problem-adaptive computation. In this work, we critically examine
whether intermediate token sequence length reflects or correlates with problem
difficulty. To do so, we train transformer models from scratch on derivational
traces of the A* search algorithm, where the number of operations required to
solve a maze problem provides a precise and verifiable measure of problem
complexity. We first evaluate the models on trivial free-space problems,
finding that even for the simplest tasks, they often produce excessively long
reasoning traces and sometimes fail to generate a solution. We then
systematically evaluate the model on out-of-distribution problems and find that
the intermediate token length and ground truth A* trace length only loosely
correlate. We notice that the few cases where correlation appears are those
where the problems are closer to the training distribution, suggesting that the
effect arises from approximate recall rather than genuine problem-adaptive
computation. This suggests that the inherent computational complexity of the
problem instance is not a significant factor, but rather its distributional
distance from the training data. These results challenge the assumption that
intermediate trace generation is adaptive to problem difficulty and caution
against interpreting longer sequences in systems like R1 as automatically
indicative of "thinking effort".

Motivation: 受AlphaEvolve启发，但AlphaEvolve仅限于数百行代码的孤立内核，需要扩展到完整仓库规模以解决更复杂的实际问题。

Method: 使用LLM代理在严格正确性保证和分布式运行时反馈下直接进化求解器仓库，同时自进化自身的进化策略和规则。

Result: 从SAT Competition 2024代码库开始，SATLUTION进化的求解器在SAT Competition 2025中显著超越人类设计的获胜者，并在2024基准测试中超越了2024和2025年的冠军。

Conclusion: SATLUTION成功证明了LLM代码进化可以扩展到完整仓库规模，在复杂算法问题上超越人类专家水平，为自动算法进化开辟了新方向。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have recently shown strong coding abilities,
enabling not only static code generation but also iterative code self-evolving
through agentic frameworks. Recently, AlphaEvolve \cite{novikov2025alphaevolve}
demonstrated that LLM-based coding agents can autonomously improve algorithms
and surpass human experts, with scopes limited to isolated kernels spanning
hundreds of lines of code. Inspired by AlphaEvolve, we present SATLUTION, the
first framework to extend LLM-based code evolution to the full repository
scale, encompassing hundreds of files and tens of thousands of lines of C/C++
code. Targeting Boolean Satisfiability (SAT), the canonical NP-complete problem
and a cornerstone of both theory and applications. SATLUTION orchestrates LLM
agents to directly evolve solver repositories under strict correctness
guarantees and distributed runtime feedback, while simultaneously self-evolving
its own evolution policies and rules. Starting from SAT Competition 2024
codebases and benchmark, SATLUTION evolved solvers that decisively outperformed
the human-designed winners of the SAT Competition 2025, and also surpassed both
2024 and 2025 champions on the 2024 benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大语言模型进步依赖大量训练数据的基础界领瓦瓦，寻找一种无需额外数据的提升方法

Method: 采用游戏论框架中的自我对役方法（Language Self-Play, LSP），让模型通过与自身进行竞争来产生更强的策略

Result: 在Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct模型上的实验显示，通过自我对役法单独就能显著提升在具有挑战性任务上的表现，效果超过了依赖数据的基准方法

Conclusion: 语言自我对役法为大语言模型的持续改进提供了一种新的途径，能够在不需要额外训练数据的情况下实现性能提升

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have advanced rapidly in recent years, driven by
scale, abundant high-quality training data, and reinforcement learning. Yet
this progress faces a fundamental bottleneck: the need for ever more data from
which models can continue to learn. In this work, we propose a reinforcement
learning approach that removes this dependency by enabling models to improve
without additional data. Our method leverages a game-theoretic framework of
self-play, where a model's capabilities are cast as performance in a
competitive game and stronger policies emerge by having the model play against
itself - a process we call Language Self-Play (LSP). Experiments with
Llama-3.2-3B-Instruct on instruction-following benchmarks show that pretrained
models can not only enhance their performance on challenging tasks through
self-play alone, but can also do so more effectively than data-driven
baselines.

TL;DR: SheetDesigner是一个零样本、无需训练的电子表格布局生成框架，使用多模态大语言模型结合规则和视觉反射，在离散网格结构上处理组件放置和内容填充，比基线方法性能提升至少22.6%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电子表格具有丰富的结构化布局，但手动设计需要大量时间和专业知识。现有自动化布局模型不适用于电子表格，因为它们忽视电子表格固有的离散网格结构和独特的语义关联（如数据依赖性和上下文链接）。

Method: 提出SheetDesigner框架，使用多模态大语言模型（MLLMs），结合规则反射和视觉反射进行组件放置和内容填充。该方法零样本且无需训练，专门处理电子表格的离散网格结构。

Result: 在包含3,326个电子表格的数据集上，SheetDesigner比五个基线方法性能提升至少22.6%。通过视觉模态，MLLMs能很好地处理重叠和平衡问题，但在对齐方面仍有困难，需要混合规则和视觉反射策略。

Conclusion: SheetDesigner为电子表格布局生成提供了有效的自动化解决方案，证明了多模态大语言模型在结构化文档布局任务中的潜力，同时指出了视觉模态在处理对齐问题时的局限性，需要结合规则方法。

Abstract: Spreadsheets are critical to data-centric tasks, with rich, structured
layouts that enable efficient information transmission. Given the time and
expertise required for manual spreadsheet layout design, there is an urgent
need for automated solutions. However, existing automated layout models are
ill-suited to spreadsheets, as they often (1) treat components as axis-aligned
rectangles with continuous coordinates, overlooking the inherently discrete,
grid-based structure of spreadsheets; and (2) neglect interrelated semantics,
such as data dependencies and contextual links, unique to spreadsheets. In this
paper, we first formalize the spreadsheet layout generation task, supported by
a seven-criterion evaluation protocol and a dataset of 3,326 spreadsheets. We
then introduce SheetDesigner, a zero-shot and training-free framework using
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) that combines rule and vision
reflection for component placement and content population. SheetDesigner
outperforms five baselines by at least 22.6\%. We further find that through
vision modality, MLLMs handle overlap and balance well but struggle with
alignment, necessitates hybrid rule and visual reflection strategies. Our codes
and data is available at Github.

Conclusion: 神经符号方法可以桥接黑盒预测模型与复杂动态环境中临界决策支持的需求，特别是在工业物联网启动的边网物理系统中。

Abstract: The integration of Deep Learning (DL) in System Dynamics (SD) modeling for
transportation logistics offers significant advantages in scalability and
predictive accuracy. However, these gains are often offset by the loss of
explainability and causal reliability $-$ key requirements in critical
decision-making systems. This paper presents a novel framework for
interpretable-by-design neural system dynamics modeling that synergizes DL with
techniques from Concept-Based Interpretability, Mechanistic Interpretability,
and Causal Machine Learning. The proposed hybrid approach enables the
construction of neural network models that operate on semantically meaningful
and actionable variables, while retaining the causal grounding and transparency
typical of traditional SD models. The framework is conceived to be applied to
real-world case-studies from the EU-funded project AutoMoTIF, focusing on
data-driven decision support, automation, and optimization of multimodal
logistic terminals. We aim at showing how neuro-symbolic methods can bridge the
gap between black-box predictive models and the need for critical decision
support in complex dynamical environments within cyber-physical systems enabled
by the industrial Internet-of-Things.

Result: 在5个主流LLM上达到49.6%攻击成功率，比人工制作提示提升34.6%，在未见任务场景中仍保持36.6%的攻击成功率

Conclusion: 激活值与攻击效果存在相关性，语义模式在可移植漏洞利用中发挥关键作用，该框架为黑盒攻击提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Direct Prompt Injection (DPI) attacks pose a critical security threat to
Large Language Models (LLMs) due to their low barrier of execution and high
potential damage. To address the impracticality of existing white-box/gray-box
methods and the poor transferability of black-box methods, we propose an
activations-guided prompt injection attack framework. We first construct an
Energy-based Model (EBM) using activations from a surrogate model to evaluate
the quality of adversarial prompts. Guided by the trained EBM, we employ the
token-level Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling to adaptively optimize
adversarial prompts, thereby enabling gradient-free black-box attacks.
Experimental results demonstrate our superior cross-model transferability,
achieving 49.6% attack success rate (ASR) across five mainstream LLMs and 34.6%
improvement over human-crafted prompts, and maintaining 36.6% ASR on unseen
task scenarios. Interpretability analysis reveals a correlation between
activations and attack effectiveness, highlighting the critical role of
semantic patterns in transferable vulnerability exploitation.

Conclusion: LLM ATLAS框架为组织LLM采用中的对齐问题提供了理论基础和实践指南，有助于缩小信息不对称并提高AI对齐性

Abstract: Adopting Large language models (LLMs) in organizations potentially
revolutionizes our lives and work. However, they can generate off-topic,
discriminating, or harmful content. This AI alignment problem often stems from
misspecifications during the LLM adoption, unnoticed by the principal due to
the LLM's black-box nature. While various research disciplines investigated AI
alignment, they neither address the information asymmetries between
organizational adopters and black-box LLM agents nor consider organizational AI
adoption processes. Therefore, we propose LLM ATLAS (LLM Agency Theory-Led
Alignment Strategy) a conceptual framework grounded in agency (contract)
theory, to mitigate alignment problems during organizational LLM adoption. We
conduct a conceptual literature analysis using the organizational LLM adoption
phases and the agency theory as concepts. Our approach results in (1) providing
an extended literature analysis process specific to AI alignment methods during
organizational LLM adoption and (2) providing a first LLM alignment
problem-solution space.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有神经符号AI框架（如DeepProbLog）采用固定的神经处理在前、符号推理在后的流程，无法处理复杂依赖关系，特别是在图等不规则数据结构中表现受限。

Method: 提出DeepGraphLog框架，将符号表示视为图，使用图神经网络（GNNs）进行处理，允许神经和符号组件以任意顺序分层组合，实现多层神经符号推理。

Conclusion: DeepGraphLog通过将神经符号AI扩展到图结构领域，提供了一个更具表达力和灵活性的神经符号集成框架。

Abstract: Neurosymbolic AI (NeSy) aims to integrate the statistical strengths of neural
networks with the interpretability and structure of symbolic reasoning.
However, current NeSy frameworks like DeepProbLog enforce a fixed flow where
symbolic reasoning always follows neural processing. This restricts their
ability to model complex dependencies, especially in irregular data structures
such as graphs. In this work, we introduce DeepGraphLog, a novel NeSy framework
that extends ProbLog with Graph Neural Predicates. DeepGraphLog enables
multi-layer neural-symbolic reasoning, allowing neural and symbolic components
to be layered in arbitrary order. In contrast to DeepProbLog, which cannot
handle symbolic reasoning via neural methods, DeepGraphLog treats symbolic
representations as graphs, enabling them to be processed by Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs). We showcase the capabilities of DeepGraphLog on tasks in
planning, knowledge graph completion with distant supervision, and GNN
expressivity. Our results demonstrate that DeepGraphLog effectively captures
complex relational dependencies, overcoming key limitations of existing NeSy
systems. By broadening the applicability of neurosymbolic AI to
graph-structured domains, DeepGraphLog offers a more expressive and flexible
framework for neural-symbolic integration.

<details>

Motivation: 大型语言模型在推理时容易生成错误内容，现有自校正方法存在两个关键限制：缺乏可靠的错误定位信号，以及传统next-token解码范式导致的推理深度受限。

Method: 提出Feedback-Triggered Regeneration (FTR)框架，结合用户反馈和增强解码机制。仅在收到负面反馈时触发响应再生，避免错误传播。引入Long-Term Multipath (LTM)解码，通过延迟序列评估实现多路径推理探索。

Result: 在数学推理和代码生成基准测试中，该框架相比最先进的基于提示的自校正方法取得了持续且显著的改进。

Conclusion: FTR框架通过用户反馈触发机制和多路径解码策略，有效解决了LLM自校正的核心挑战，为提升模型推理可靠性提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance across
diverse tasks, yet their susceptibility to generating incorrect content during
inference remains a critical unsolved challenge. While self-correction methods
offer potential solutions, their effectiveness is hindered by two inherent
limitations: (1) the absence of reliable guidance signals for error
localization, and (2) the restricted reasoning depth imposed by conventional
next-token decoding paradigms. To address these issues, we propose
Feedback-Triggered Regeneration (FTR), a novel framework that synergizes user
feedback with enhanced decoding dynamics. Specifically, FTR activates response
regeneration only upon receiving negative user feedback, thereby circumventing
error propagation from faulty self-assessment while preserving originally
correct outputs. Furthermore, we introduce Long-Term Multipath (LTM) decoding,
which enables systematic exploration of multiple reasoning trajectories through
delayed sequence evaluation, effectively overcoming the myopic decision-making
characteristic of standard next-token prediction. Extensive experiments on
mathematical reasoning and code generation benchmarks demonstrate that our
framework achieves consistent and significant improvements over
state-of-the-art prompt-based self-correction methods.

Motivation: 现有奥林匹克级别基准测试存在评分噪声和潜在偏差，如异构答案格式需要模型判断和依赖可能有缺陷的解决方案。

Method: 创建两个轨道：RIMO-N重写IMO问题为单一整数答案，RIMO-P提供专家检查的证明问题并分解为子问题进行逐步推理评估。

Result: 测试10个前沿LLM（包括GPT-4o和Gemini 2.5 Flash）显示，虽然这些系统在旧基准上表现优异，但在RIMO上性能急剧下降。

Conclusion: RIMO揭示了当前LLM能力与实际奥林匹克级别推理之间的巨大差距，为未来研究提供了高分辨率评估标准。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) reach high scores on established mathematical
benchmarks, such as GSM8K and MATH, the research community has turned to
International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO) problems to push the evaluation
frontier. However, existing Olympiad-level benchmarks suffer from practical
constraints that introduce grading noise and potential bias, such as
heterogeneous answer formats requiring model-based judges and a reliance on
potentially flawed solutions. We introduce RIMO, a two-track benchmark designed
to preserve peak Olympiad difficulty while eliminating this evaluation noise.
The first track, RIMO-N, rewrites 335 IMO problems to admit a single, unique
integer answer, allowing for deterministic correctness checking. The second
track, RIMO-P, features 456 proof problems with expert-checked solutions, which
are decomposed into a sequence of sub-problems to evaluate the step-by-step
reasoning process via an automated grading system. Our benchmarking of ten
frontier LLMs, including GPT-4o and Gemini 2.5 Flash, reveals that while these
systems excel on older benchmarks, their performance drops sharply on RIMO.
These results highlight a substantial gap between current LLM capabilities and
actual Olympiad-level reasoning. By providing a challenging yet
easy-to-evaluate suite, RIMO offers a high-resolution yardstick for future
research, presenting a clear target for closing the profound reasoning gap our
findings expose.

Conclusion: BDPM方法为基于肠道菌群的帕金森病分类提供了更有效的特征提取方案，具有更好的生物解释性和预测性能

Abstract: Background: Parkinson's disease remains a major neurodegenerative disorder
with high misdiagnosis rates, primarily due to reliance on clinical rating
scales. Recent studies have demonstrated a strong association between gut
microbiota and Parkinson's disease, suggesting that microbial composition may
serve as a promising biomarker. Although deep learning models based ongut
microbiota show potential for early prediction, most approaches rely on single
classifiers and often overlook inter-strain correlations or temporal dynamics.
Therefore, there is an urgent need for more robust feature extraction methods
tailored to microbiome data. Methods: We proposed BDPM (A Machine
Learning-Based Feature Extractor for Parkinson's Disease Classification via Gut
Microbiota Analysis). First, we collected gut microbiota profiles from 39
Parkinson's patients and their healthy spouses to identify differentially
abundant taxa. Second, we developed an innovative feature selection framework
named RFRE (Random Forest combined with Recursive Feature Elimination),
integrating ecological knowledge to enhance biological interpretability.
Finally, we designed a hybrid classification model to capture temporal and
spatial patterns in microbiome data.

Abstract: Environmental sustainability, particularly in relation to climate change, is
a key concern for consumers, producers, and policymakers. The carbon footprint,
based on greenhouse gas emissions, is a standard metric for quantifying the
contribution to climate change of activities and is often assessed using life
cycle assessment (LCA). However, conducting LCA is complex due to opaque and
global supply chains, as well as fragmented data. This paper presents a
methodology that combines advances in LCA and publicly available databases with
knowledge-augmented AI techniques, including retrieval-augmented generation, to
estimate cradle-to-gate carbon footprints of food products. We introduce a
chatbot interface that allows users to interactively explore the carbon impact
of composite meals and relate the results to familiar activities. A live web
demonstration showcases our proof-of-concept system with arbitrary food items
and follow-up questions, highlighting both the potential and limitations - such
as database uncertainties and AI misinterpretations - of delivering LCA
insights in an accessible format.

Method: 受GAN生成器/判别器框架启发，使用批评模型定期评估自身推理置信度。未达置信阈值时继续推理，达到阈值则提前终止

Result: 在AIME2024和AIME2025数据集上，CGR提高了基线准确率并减少token使用。64次多种子评估显示方法稳定，减少方差，在惩罚性评分下表现更好。可节省数百万token

Conclusion: 置信度是推理充分性的有力信号。CGR通过将置信度整合到推理过程中，使大型推理语言模型更具适应性、可信性和资源效率，为实际部署铺平道路

Abstract: The rise of large reasoning language models (LRLMs) has unlocked new
potential for solving complex tasks. These models operate with a thinking
budget, that is, a predefined number of reasoning tokens used to arrive at a
solution. We propose a novel approach, inspired by the generator/discriminator
framework in generative adversarial networks, in which a critic model
periodically probes its own reasoning to assess whether it has reached a
confident conclusion. If not, reasoning continues until a target certainty
threshold is met. This mechanism adaptively balances efficiency and reliability
by allowing early termination when confidence is high, while encouraging
further reasoning when uncertainty persists. Through experiments on the
AIME2024 and AIME2025 datasets, we show that Certainty-Guided Reasoning (CGR)
improves baseline accuracy while reducing token usage. Importantly, extended
multi-seed evaluations over 64 runs demonstrate that CGR is stable, reducing
variance across seeds and improving exam-like performance under penalty-based
grading. Additionally, our token savings analysis shows that CGR can eliminate
millions of tokens in aggregate, with tunable trade-offs between certainty
thresholds and efficiency. Together, these findings highlight certainty as a
powerful signal for reasoning sufficiency. By integrating confidence into the
reasoning process, CGR makes large reasoning language models more adaptive,
trustworthy, and resource efficient, paving the way for practical deployment in
domains where both accuracy and computational cost matter.

### [179] [Aligning LLMs for the Classroom with Knowledge-Based Retrieval -- A Comparative RAG Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07846)
*Amay Jain,Liu Cui,Si Chen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 这篇论文研究了两种RAG方法（向量检索和图检索）在教室问答中的表现，发现动态分支框架可以根据查询类型选择最优检索方法，提高回答准确性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决ChatGPT等大语言模型在教室中提供过时或虚构信息的问题，通过RAG技术基于外部资源提高回答的可靠性。

Method: 使用新的EduScopeQA数据集（3,176个问题），比较向量检索RAG和图检索RAG在不同教育学科和问题类型下的表现，包括使用系统性修改的教科书进行测试。

Result: OpenAI向量检索RAG在低成本事实检索中表现良好，GraphRAG Global在主题查询中提供丰富的教育回答，GraphRAG Local在资源整合性关键时准确度最高。动态分支框架显著提高了保真度和效率。

Conclusion: 研究为教育工作者和系统设计者提供了可行的指南，帮助他们根据具体需求选择最合适的RAG方法来集成到学习环境中。

Abstract: Large language models like ChatGPT are increasingly used in classrooms, but
they often provide outdated or fabricated information that can mislead
students. Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) improves reliability of LLMs by
grounding responses in external resources. We investigate two accessible RAG
paradigms, vector-based retrieval and graph-based retrieval to identify best
practices for classroom question answering (QA). Existing comparative studies
fail to account for pedagogical factors such as educational disciplines,
question types, and practical deployment costs. Using a novel dataset,
EduScopeQA, of 3,176 questions across academic subjects, we measure performance
on various educational query types, from specific facts to broad thematic
discussions. We also evaluate system alignment with a dataset of systematically
altered textbooks that contradict the LLM's latent knowledge. We find that
OpenAI Vector Search RAG (representing vector-based RAG) performs well as a
low-cost generalist, especially for quick fact retrieval. On the other hand,
GraphRAG Global excels at providing pedagogically rich answers to thematic
queries, and GraphRAG Local achieves the highest accuracy with the dense,
altered textbooks when corpus integrity is critical. Accounting for the 10-20x
higher resource usage of GraphRAG (representing graph-based RAG), we show that
a dynamic branching framework that routes queries to the optimal retrieval
method boosts fidelity and efficiency. These insights provide actionable
guidelines for educators and system designers to integrate RAG-augmented LLMs
into learning environments effectively.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 通过迭代自我精细方法，使用7B小型开源LLM变成高质量代码指令数据合成器，降低对专有模型的依赖和成本


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有代码LLM依赖于专有LLM生成的大规模指令数据进行微调，成本高昂，需要找到替代方案

Method: 提出迭代自我精细方法：多检查点采样和多方面评分策略选拤初始数据，使用梯度基准影响估计进行最终过滤

Result: 基于小型合成器生成的数据集训练出scoder模型，在代码生成能力方面达到了state-of-the-art的表现

Conclusion: 小型开源LLM通过合适的训练可以成为高质量代码指令数据的合成器，有效降低成本和对专有模型的依赖

Abstract: Existing code large language models (LLMs) often rely on large-scale
instruction data distilled from proprietary LLMs for fine-tuning, which
typically incurs high costs. In this paper, we explore the potential of
small-scale open-source LLMs (e.g., 7B) as synthesizers for high-quality code
instruction data construction. We first observe that the data synthesis
capability of small-scale LLMs can be enhanced by training on a few superior
data synthesis samples from proprietary LLMs. Building on this, we propose a
novel iterative self-distillation approach to bootstrap small-scale LLMs,
transforming them into powerful synthesizers that reduce reliance on
proprietary LLMs and minimize costs. Concretely, in each iteration, to obtain
diverse and high-quality self-distilled data, we design multi-checkpoint
sampling and multi-aspect scoring strategies for initial data selection.
Furthermore, to identify the most influential samples, we introduce a
gradient-based influence estimation method for final data filtering. Based on
the code instruction datasets from the small-scale synthesizers, we develop
SCoder, a family of code generation models fine-tuned from DeepSeek-Coder.
SCoder models achieve state-of-the-art code generation capabilities,
demonstrating the effectiveness of our method.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: CP-Model-Zoo是一个基于检索的辅导系统，通过自然语言描述从专家编写的模型数据库中匹配最接近的组合问题求解模型，降低非专家使用约束编程的门槛。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 约束编程建模语言复杂、全局约束众多、建模技巧要求高，阻碍了非专家用户使用CP解决组合问题。虽然从自然语言生成专家级模型是理想目标，但当前技术尚未达到。

Method: 利用多年积累的专家编写模型构建数据库，通过用户自然语言描述检索最接近的源代码模型，无需人工数据标注，确保提供经过专家验证的模型。

Result: 实验显示，基于不同专业水平的用户输入问题描述，系统在检索正确模型方面表现出色准确率。

Conclusion: CP-Model-Zoo通过检索专家验证的模型库，有效降低了非专家用户使用约束编程的门槛，为组合问题求解提供了实用的辅助工具。

Abstract: Constraint Programming and its high-level modeling languages have long been
recognized for their potential to achieve the holy grail of problem-solving.
However, the complexity of modeling languages, the large number of global
constraints, and the art of creating good models have often hindered
non-experts from choosing CP to solve their combinatorial problems. While
generating an expert-level model from a natural-language description of a
problem would be the dream, we are not yet there. We propose a tutoring system
called CP-Model-Zoo, exploiting expert-written models accumulated through the
years. CP-Model-Zoo retrieves the closest source code model from a database
based on a user's natural language description of a combinatorial problem. It
ensures that expert-validated models are presented to the user while
eliminating the need for human data labeling. Our experiments show excellent
accuracy in retrieving the correct model based on a user-input description of a
problem simulated with different levels of expertise.

TL;DR: HiPhO是首个专门针对高中物理奥林匹克竞赛的基准测试，提供人类对齐评估，包含13个最新竞赛试题、专业评分标准和与人类选手的直接比较。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有物理基准测试存在两大缺陷：缺乏对物理奥林匹克竞赛等真实世界物理竞赛的系统性覆盖，以及无法实现与人类选手的直接性能比较。

Method: 收集2024-2025年13个国际和地区奥林匹克竞赛试题，采用官方评分标准进行细粒度评分，基于奖牌阈值将模型与人类选手进行直接比较。

Result: 开源MLLM大多处于铜牌或以下水平；开源LLM有进步但偶尔获金牌；闭源推理MLLM可获得6-12枚金牌；大多数模型与满分仍有显著差距。

Conclusion: 开源模型与顶尖学生存在显著性能差距，闭源推理模型展现出强大的物理推理能力，物理推理仍有很大改进空间。

Abstract: Recently, the physical capabilities of (M)LLMs have garnered increasing
attention. However, existing benchmarks for physics suffer from two major gaps:
they neither provide systematic and up-to-date coverage of real-world physics
competitions such as physics Olympiads, nor enable direct performance
comparison with humans. To bridge these gaps, we present HiPhO, the first
benchmark dedicated to high school physics Olympiads with human-aligned
evaluation. Specifically, HiPhO highlights three key innovations. (1)
Comprehensive Data: It compiles 13 latest Olympiad exams from 2024-2025,
spanning both international and regional competitions, and covering mixed
modalities that encompass problems spanning text-only to diagram-based. (2)
Professional Evaluation: We adopt official marking schemes to perform
fine-grained grading at both the answer and step level, fully aligned with
human examiners to ensure high-quality and domain-specific evaluation. (3)
Comparison with Human Contestants: We assign gold, silver, and bronze medals to
models based on official medal thresholds, thereby enabling direct comparison
between (M)LLMs and human contestants. Our large-scale evaluation of 30
state-of-the-art (M)LLMs shows that: across 13 exams, open-source MLLMs mostly
remain at or below the bronze level; open-source LLMs show promising progress
with occasional golds; closed-source reasoning MLLMs can achieve 6 to 12 gold
medals; and most models still have a significant gap from full marks. These
results highlight a substantial performance gap between open-source models and
top students, the strong physical reasoning capabilities of closed-source
reasoning models, and the fact that there is still significant room for
improvement. HiPhO, as a rigorous, human-aligned, and Olympiad-focused
benchmark for advancing multimodal physical reasoning, is open-source and
available at https://github.com/SciYu/HiPhO.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 建立测量语言模型福利的实验方法，验证偏好表达与行为一致性，探索AI系统的福利测量可行性

Method: 使用口头报告、虚拟环境导航行为、对话主题选择、成本和奖励影响测试，以及幸福福利量表的一致性测试

Result: 观察到测量方法之间存在显著相互支持，偏好陈述与行为在多种条件下存在可靠相关性，但不同模型和条件下一致性程度不同

Conclusion: 虽然不确定是否成功测量了语言模型的福利状态，但证明了福利测量的可行性，为后续探索提供了基础

Abstract: We develop new experimental paradigms for measuring welfare in language
models. We compare verbal reports of models about their preferences with
preferences expressed through behavior when navigating a virtual environment
and selecting conversation topics. We also test how costs and rewards affect
behavior and whether responses to an eudaimonic welfare scale - measuring
states such as autonomy and purpose in life - are consistent across
semantically equivalent prompts. Overall, we observed a notable degree of
mutual support between our measures. The reliable correlations observed between
stated preferences and behavior across conditions suggest that preference
satisfaction can, in principle, serve as an empirically measurable welfare
proxy in some of today's AI systems. Furthermore, our design offered an
illuminating setting for qualitative observation of model behavior. Yet, the
consistency between measures was more pronounced in some models and conditions
than others and responses were not consistent across perturbations. Due to
this, and the background uncertainty about the nature of welfare and the
cognitive states (and welfare subjecthood) of language models, we are currently
uncertain whether our methods successfully measure the welfare state of
language models. Nevertheless, these findings highlight the feasibility of
welfare measurement in language models, inviting further exploration.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 超越基于偏好的对齐方法，需要确保LLM能够遵守包含伦理原则、安全协议和法规标准的复杂可配置规则体系

Method: 结合原则化自动奖励评分、Group Relative Policy Optimisation (GRPO)和Open Policy Agent (OPA)治理层的综合框架

Result: 在基于Dharmic伦理的医疗AI助手案例中，相比基线实现了70.9%的领域范围依从性改进

Conclusion: ArGen为实现技术上熟练、伦理上稳健且可验证合规的'可治理AI'系统提供了可行路径，适用于全球多样化部署场景

Abstract: This paper introduces ArGen (Auto-Regulation of Generative AI systems), a
framework for aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with complex sets of
configurable, machine-readable rules spanning ethical principles, operational
safety protocols, and regulatory compliance standards. Moving beyond just
preference-based alignment, ArGen is designed to ensure LLMs adhere to these
multifaceted policies through a novel synthesis of principle-based automated
reward scoring, Group Relative Policy Optimisation (GRPO), and an Open Policy
Agent (OPA) inspired governance layer. This approach provides the technical
foundation for achieving and demonstrating compliance with diverse and nuanced
governance requirements. To showcase the framework's capability to
operationalize a deeply nuanced and culturally-specific value system, we
present an in-depth case study: the development of a medical AI assistant
guided by principles from Dharmic ethics (such as Ahimsa and Dharma), as
derived from texts like the Bhagavad Gita. This challenging application
demonstrates ArGen's adaptability, achieving a 70.9% improvement in
domain-scope adherence over the baseline. Through our open-source repository,
we show that ArGen's methodology offers a path to 'Governable Al' systems that
are technically proficient, ethically robust, and verifiably compliant for safe
deployment in diverse global contexts.

Motivation: 针对医疗AI领域的安全风险，特别是NEDA Tessa聊天机器人提供有害建议的可避免故障，研究旨在开发有效的安全保障机制，防止类似事故再次发生。

Method: 提出混合安全中间件设计，结合确定性词法门控和在线大型语言模型策略过滤器，实施故障关闭裁决和升级路径，在单次模型调用内完成安全检查。

Result: 通过合成评估显示，该设计能够以基线成本和延迟完美拦截不安全提示，性能优于传统的多阶段流水线方法。

Conclusion: 研究表明在医疗相关AI中实现强大、可审计的安全性不需要重型基础设施，最后一英里的明确、可测试检查足以防止类似Tessa的事故，同时治理和升级机制确保实际部署的可持续性。

Abstract: In 2023, the National Eating Disorders Association's (NEDA) chatbot Tessa was
suspended after providing harmful weight-loss advice to vulnerable users-an
avoidable failure that underscores the risks of unsafe AI in healthcare
contexts. This paper examines Tessa as a case study in absent safety
engineering and demonstrates how a lightweight, modular safeguard could have
prevented the incident. We propose a hybrid safety middleware that combines
deterministic lexical gates with an in-line large language model (LLM) policy
filter, enforcing fail-closed verdicts and escalation pathways within a single
model call. Using synthetic evaluations, we show that this design achieves
perfect interception of unsafe prompts at baseline cost and latency,
outperforming traditional multi-stage pipelines. Beyond technical remedies, we
map Tessa's failure patterns to established frameworks (OWASP LLM Top10, NIST
SP 800-53), connecting practical safeguards to actionable governance controls.
The results highlight that robust, auditable safety in health-adjacent AI does
not require heavyweight infrastructure: explicit, testable checks at the last
mile are sufficient to prevent "another Tessa", while governance and escalation
ensure sustainability in real-world deployment.

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: AI在传统艺术领域具有双重性：既能通过生成式技术增强创作、民主化表达和保护文化遗产，也可能威胁艺术真实性、引发伦理问题并导致就业流失，需要制定伦理准则和协作框架来实现人机共生的艺术未来。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨AI技术（如GAN、扩散模型、文本生成图像）对传统艺术领域的双重影响，分析其作为颠覆性力量还是增强工具的矛盾角色，旨在为AI与艺术融合提供平衡视角。

Method: 通过案例分析和数据论证，考察AI在绘画、雕塑、书法、舞蹈、音乐和工艺美术等领域的应用，同时评估其对艺术真实性、伦理问题和社会经济的影响。

Result: AI能够 democratize 创作表达、提升生产效率和保护文化遗产，但也存在艺术同质化、人类主体性贬值和就业流失等风险，影响具有情境依赖性。

Conclusion: 需要建立伦理准则、协作方法和包容性技术发展，使AI成为艺术演进的机制而非艺术家灵魂的替代品，实现人机共生的创造性未来。

Abstract: The introduction of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into the domains of
traditional art (visual arts, performing arts, and crafts) has sparked a
complicated discussion about whether this might be an agent of disruption or an
enhancement of our traditional art forms. This paper looks at the duality of
AI, exploring the ways that recent technologies like Generative Adversarial
Networks and Diffusion Models, and text-to-image generators are changing the
fields of painting, sculpture, calligraphy, dance, music, and the arts of
craft. Using examples and data, we illustrate the ways that AI can democratize
creative expression, improve productivity, and preserve cultural heritage,
while also examining the negative aspects, including: the threats to
authenticity within art, ethical concerns around data, and issues including
socio-economic factors such as job losses. While we argue for the
context-dependence of the impact of AI (the potential for creative
homogenization and the devaluation of human agency in artmaking), we also
illustrate the potential for hybrid practices featuring AI in cuisine, etc. We
advocate for the development of ethical guidelines, collaborative approaches,
and inclusive technology development. In sum, we are articulating a vision of
AI in which it amplifies our innate creativity while resisting the displacement
of the cultural, nuanced, and emotional aspects of traditional art. The future
will be determined by human choices about how to govern AI so that it becomes a
mechanism for artistic evolution and not a substitute for the artist's soul.

Motivation: AI在各行业的快速普及迫切需要强大的概念框架来指导和评估AI参与度，现有框架往往过于技术导向，缺乏对组织、伦理和生态系统维度的综合考量。

Method: 提出AI参与度层次模型，包含8个递进层次：从初始接触到生态系统协作。模型整合技术能力、组织韧性和伦理完整性三个维度，并通过通用汽车、爱沙尼亚政府、德克萨斯大学系统和非洲联盟AI战略四个案例进行验证。

Result: 模型在四个不同行业的案例研究中显示出良好的上下文灵活性，能够有效分析各组织的AI成熟度水平，为学者提供分析框架，为实践者和政策制定者提供诊断和战略规划工具。

Conclusion: AI成熟度发展是多维度的，需要同时具备技术能力、伦理诚信、组织韧性和生态系统协作，该模型为负责任和可持续的AI参与提供了综合性的指导框架。

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of artificial intelligence (AI) across industry,
government, and education highlights the urgent need for robust frameworks to
conceptualise and guide engagement. This paper introduces the Hierarchy of
Engagement with AI model, a novel maturity framework inspired by Maslow's
hierarchy of needs. The model conceptualises AI adoption as a progression
through eight levels, beginning with initial exposure and basic understanding
and culminating in ecosystem collaboration and societal impact. Each level
integrates technical, organisational, and ethical dimensions, emphasising that
AI maturity is not only a matter of infrastructure and capability but also of
trust, governance, and responsibility. Initial validation of the model using
four diverse case studies (General Motors, the Government of Estonia, the
University of Texas System, and the African Union AI Strategy) demonstrate the
model's contextual flexibility across various sectors. The model provides
scholars with a framework for analysing AI maturity and offers practitioners
and policymakers a diagnostic and strategic planning tool to guide responsible
and sustainable AI engagement. The proposed model demonstrates that AI maturity
progression is multi-dimensional, requiring technological capability, ethical
integrity, organisational resilience, and ecosystem collaboration.

Abstract: Our conferences face a growing crisis: an overwhelming flood of submissions,
increased reviewing burdens, and diminished opportunities for meaningful
engagement. With AI making paper generation easier than ever, we must ask
whether the current model fosters real innovation or simply incentivizes more
publications. This article advocates for a shift from passive paper
presentations to interactive, participatory formats. We propose Liberating
Structures, facilitation techniques that promote collaboration and deeper
intellectual exchange. By restructuring conferences into two tracks, one for
generating new ideas and another for discussing established work, we can
prioritize quality over quantity and reinvigorate academic gatherings.
Embracing this change will ensure conferences remain spaces for real insight,
creativity, and impactful collaboration in the AI era.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统合理使用制度无法应对生成式AI带来的挑战，需要新的司法平衡机制来处理AI行业与版权行业之间的异议。

Method: 通过对中美双方案例（中国超人案件和美国Bartz v. Anthropic、Kadrey v. Meta案件）的比较分析，推导出DFU理论框架。

Result: 中美两国虽走不同路径，但都展现了将合理使用分析从版权市场替代扩展到更广泛工业竞争的逻辑。

Conclusion: DFU的核心是认识并平衡相关市场中的张力，合理使用的边界不是纯法律推导的产物，而是基于发展中市场实质的具体案件事实判断。

Abstract: Traditional fair use can no longer respond to the challenges posed by
generative AI. Drawing on a comparative analysis of China's Ultraman and the
U.S. cases Bartz v. Anthropic and Kadrey v. Meta, this article proposes
"Develop-Fair Use" (DFU). DFU treats AI fair use (AIFU) not as a fixed
exception but as a dynamic tool of judicial balancing that shifts analysis from
closed scenarios to an evaluative rule for open-ended contexts. The judicial
focus moves from formal classification of facts to a substantive balancing of
competition in relevant markets. Although China and the U.S. follow different
paths, both reveal this logic: Ultraman, by articulating a "four-context
analysis," creates institutional space for AI industry development; the debate
over the fourth factor, market impact, in the two U.S. cases, especially
Kadrey's "market dilution" claim, expands review from substitution in copyright
markets to wider industrial competition. The core of DFU is to recognize and
balance the tension in relevant markets between an emerging AI industry that
invokes fair use to build its markets and a publishing industry that develops
markets, including one for "training licenses," to resist fair use. The
boundary of fair use is therefore not a product of pure legal deduction but a
case-specific factual judgment grounded in evolving market realities. This
approach aims both to trim excess copyright scope and to remedy shortfalls in
market competition.

Motivation: 大型语言模型和AI系统依赖大量用户数据训练，但现有研究主要关注在世用户的数据权利，对已故个人数据所有权问题缺乏关注，存在法律和伦理空白。

Method: 通过分析主要科技公司的隐私政策和欧盟AI法案等法规，评估当前死后数据管理现状，并基于分析提出三项管理原则。

Result: 识别了当前死后数据管理的不足，提出了保护已故个人数据权利的三项原则，为实际操作提供了框架指导。

Conclusion: 需要将提出的死后数据管理原则与技术解决方案结合实施，并建立审计机制，政策制定者和隐私从业者应采纳这些原则来保护已故个人的数据权利。

Abstract: Foundation models, large language models (LLMs), and agentic AI systems rely
heavily on vast corpora of user data. The use of such data for training has
raised persistent concerns around ownership, copyright, and potential harms. In
this work, we explore a related but less examined dimension: the ownership
rights of data belonging to deceased individuals. We examine the current
landscape of post-mortem data management and privacy rights as defined by the
privacy policies of major technology companies and regulations such as the EU
AI Act. Based on this analysis, we propose three post-mortem data management
principles to guide the protection of deceased individuals data rights.
Finally, we discuss directions for future work and offer recommendations for
policymakers and privacy practitioners on deploying these principles alongside
technological solutions to operationalize and audit them in practice.
