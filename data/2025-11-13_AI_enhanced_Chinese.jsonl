It is a tremendously powerful tool for describing and solving combinatorial problems. Like any other language, ASP requires users to learn how it works and the syntax involved. It is becoming increasingly required for those unfamiliar with programming languages to interact with code. This paper proposes a novel method of translating unconstrained English into ASP programs for logic puzzles using an LLM and Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR) graphs. Everything from ASP rules, facts, and constraints is generated to fully represent and solve the desired problem. Example logic puzzles are used to demonstrate the capabilities of the system. While most current methods rely entirely on an LLM, our system minimizes the role of the LLM only to complete straightforward tasks. The LLM is used to simplify natural language sentences, identify keywords, and generate simple facts. The AMR graphs are then parsed from simplified language and used to generate ASP constraints systematically. The system successfully creates an entire ASP program that solves a combinatorial logic problem. This approach is a significant first step in creating a lighter-weight, explainable system that converts natural language to solve complex logic problems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4f7f\u7528LLM\u548cAMR\u56fe\u5c06\u65e0\u7ea6\u675f\u82f1\u8bed\u7ffb\u8bd1\u6210ASP\u7a0b\u5e8f\u7684\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u903b\u8f91\u8c1c\u9898\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u5b8c\u6574\u7684ASP\u7a0b\u5e8f\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u591a\u4e0d\u719f\u6089\u7f16\u7a0b\u8bed\u8a00\u7684\u4eba\u9700\u8981\u4e0e\u4ee3\u7801\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u8ba9\u975e\u4e13\u4e1a\u4eba\u58eb\u80fd\u591f\u4f7f\u7528\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u63cf\u8ff0\u903b\u8f91\u95ee\u9898\u5e76\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210ASP\u7a0b\u5e8f\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528LLM\u7b80\u5316\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u53e5\u5b50\u3001\u8bc6\u522b\u5173\u952e\u8bcd\u548c\u751f\u6210\u7b80\u5355\u4e8b\u5b9e\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u4ece\u7b80\u5316\u8bed\u8a00\u89e3\u6790AMR\u56fe\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5730\u751f\u6210ASP\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u6700\u5c0f\u5316LLM\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "result": "\u7cfb\u7edf\u6210\u529f\u521b\u5efa\u4e86\u5b8c\u6574\u7684ASP\u7a0b\u5e8f\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u7ec4\u5408\u903b\u8f91\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5c06\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u53ef\u6267\u884c\u903b\u8f91\u7a0b\u5e8f\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u662f\u5728\u521b\u5efa\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u5230\u590d\u6742\u903b\u8f91\u95ee\u9898\u89e3\u51b3\u7cfb\u7edf\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u7b2c\u4e00\u6b65\u3002"}}

Although humans effortlessly solve ARC-AGI, it remains extremely difficult for even the most advanced artificial intelligence systems. Inspired by methods for modelling human intelligence spanning neuroscience to psychology, we propose a cognitively plausible ARC-AGI solver. Our solver integrates System 1 intuitions with System 2 reasoning in an efficient and interpretable process using neurosymbolic methods based on Vector Symbolic Algebras (VSAs). Our solver works by object-centric program synthesis, leveraging VSAs to represent abstract objects, guide solution search, and enable sample-efficient neural learning. Preliminary results indicate success, with our solver scoring 10.8% on ARC-AGI-1-Train and 3.0% on ARC-AGI-1-Eval. Additionally, our solver performs well on simpler benchmarks, scoring 94.5% on Sort-of-ARC and 83.1% on 1D-ARC -- the latter outperforming GPT-4 at a tiny fraction of the computational cost. Importantly, our approach is unique; we believe we are the first to apply VSAs to ARC-AGI and have developed the most cognitively plausible ARC-AGI solver yet.

The aim of this work is therefore to design an effective solution based on Artificial Intelligence techniques to automate the extraction of the information necessary for the digitization of a plant, in order to streamline the daily work of MGM users. The solution received the P&ID of the plant as input, each one in pdf format, and uses OCR, Vision LLM, Object Detection, Relational Reasoning and optimization algorithms to return an output consisting of two sets of information: a structured overview of the relevant design data and the hierarchical framework of the plant. To achieve convincing results, we extend a state-of-the-art model for Scene Graph Generation introducing a brand new Transformer architecture with the aim of deepening the analysis of the complex relations between the plant's components. The synergistic use of the listed AI-based technologies allowed to overcome many obstacles arising from the high variety of data, due to the lack of standardization.

Yet, for many practical systems -- especially in aerospace -- this region cannot be determined a priori and is often challenging to compute. One of the most common methods for computing the stability region is to identify a Lyapunov function. A Lyapunov function is a positive function whose time derivative along system trajectories is non-positive, which provides a sufficient condition for stability and characterizes an estimated stability region. However, existing methods of characterizing a stability region via a Lyapunov function often rely on explicit knowledge of the system governing equations. In this work, we present a new physics-informed machine learning method of characterizing an estimated stability region by inferring a Lyapunov function from system trajectory data that treats the dynamical system as a black box and does not require explicit knowledge of the system governing equations. In our presented Lyapunov function Inference method (LyapInf), we propose a quadratic form for the unknown Lyapunov function and fit the unknown quadratic operator to system trajectory data by minimizing the average residual of the Zubov equation, a first-order partial differential equation whose solution yields a Lyapunov function. The inferred quadratic Lyapunov function can then characterize an ellipsoidal estimate of the stability region. Numerical results on benchmark examples demonstrate that our physics-informed stability analysis method successfully characterizes a near-maximal ellipsoid of the system stability region associated with the inferred Lyapunov function without requiring knowledge of the system governing equations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5LyapInf\uff0c\u4ece\u7cfb\u7edf\u8f68\u8ff9\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u63a8\u65adLyapunov\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u7cfb\u7edf\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u7a0b\u7684\u663e\u5f0f\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4f30\u8ba1\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u533a\u57df\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u590d\u6742\u52a8\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u64cd\u4f5c\u4e2d\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u6240\u6709\u72b6\u6001\u8f68\u8ff9\u6536\u655b\u5230\u671f\u671b\u5e73\u8861\u70b9\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u533a\u57df\u901a\u5e38\u96be\u4ee5\u8ba1\u7b97\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u7cfb\u7edf\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u7a0b\u7684\u663e\u5f0f\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u8fd9\u5728\u8bb8\u591a\u5b9e\u9645\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u4e0d\u53ef\u884c\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faLyapInf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5047\u8bbe\u672a\u77e5Lyapunov\u51fd\u6570\u4e3a\u4e8c\u6b21\u5f62\u5f0f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6700\u5c0f\u5316Zubov\u65b9\u7a0b\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u6b8b\u5dee\u6765\u62df\u5408\u672a\u77e5\u4e8c\u6b21\u7b97\u5b50\uff0c\u5c06\u52a8\u529b\u7cfb\u7edf\u89c6\u4e3a\u9ed1\u7bb1\u5904\u7406\u3002", "result": "\u6570\u503c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6210\u529f\u8868\u5f81\u4e86\u4e0e\u63a8\u65adLyapunov\u51fd\u6570\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u533a\u57df\u7684\u8fd1\u6700\u5927\u692d\u5706\u4f53\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u7cfb\u7edf\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u7a0b\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u7cfb\u7edf\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u7a0b\u663e\u5f0f\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u4f30\u8ba1\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u5728\u822a\u7a7a\u822a\u5929\u7b49\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

However, most existing methods rely on static datasets and fixed models, limiting their ability to adapt to changes in user behavior over time. To address this limitation, we explore a novel task termed continual next POI recommendation, where models dynamically adapt to evolving user interests through continual updates. This task is particularly challenging, as it requires capturing shifting user behaviors while retaining previously learned knowledge. Moreover, it is essential to ensure efficiency in update time and memory usage for real-world deployment. To this end, we propose GIRAM (Generative Key-based Interest Retrieval and Adaptive Modeling), an efficient, model-agnostic framework that integrates context-aware sustained interests with recent interests. GIRAM comprises four components: (1) an interest memory to preserve historical preferences; (2) a context-aware key encoding module for unified interest key representation; (3) a generative key-based retrieval module to identify diverse and relevant sustained interests; and (4) an adaptive interest update and fusion module to update the interest memory and balance sustained and recent interests. In particular, GIRAM can be seamlessly integrated with existing next POI recommendation models. Experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that GIRAM consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods while maintaining high efficiency in both update time and memory consumption.", "AI": {"tldr": "GIRAM\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u6301\u7eed\u4e0b\u4e00\u4e2a\u5174\u8da3\u70b9\u63a8\u8350\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u6301\u7eed\u5174\u8da3\u548c\u8fd1\u671f\u5174\u8da3\u6765\u52a8\u6001\u9002\u5e94\u7528\u6237\u884c\u4e3a\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u4e0b\u4e00\u4e2a\u5174\u8da3\u70b9\u63a8\u8350\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u9759\u6001\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u56fa\u5b9a\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u9002\u5e94\u968f\u65f6\u95f4\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u7528\u6237\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u56e0\u6b64\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u80fd\u591f\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u63a8\u8350\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faGIRAM\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u56db\u4e2a\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff1a\u5174\u8da3\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5e93\u3001\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u952e\u7f16\u7801\u6a21\u5757\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u751f\u6210\u952e\u7684\u68c0\u7d22\u6a21\u5757\u3001\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5174\u8da3\u66f4\u65b0\u548c\u878d\u5408\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u53ef\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u63a8\u8350\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u7f1d\u96c6\u6210\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cGIRAM\u5728\u66f4\u65b0\u65f6\u95f4\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u6d88\u8017\u65b9\u9762\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u6548\u7387\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u6301\u7eed\u4f18\u4e8e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "GIRAM\u901a\u8fc7\u6709\u6548\u6574\u5408\u6301\u7eed\u5174\u8da3\u548c\u8fd1\u671f\u5174\u8da3\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u6301\u7eed\u4e0b\u4e00\u4e2a\u5174\u8da3\u70b9\u63a8\u8350\u4e2d\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u4fdd\u7559\u548c\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Recent reinforcement learning approaches address this limitation but face two critical challenges. First, they evaluate teaching effectiveness solely based on whether students produce correct outputs, unable to distinguish whether students genuinely understand or echo teacher-provided answers during interaction. Second, they cannot perceive students' evolving cognitive states in real time through interactive dialogue, thus failing to adapt teaching strategies to match students' cognitive levels dynamically. We propose the Unidirectional Cognitive Optimization (UCO) method to address these challenges. UCO uses a multi-turn interactive reinforcement learning paradigm where the innovation lies in two synergistic reward functions: the Progress Reward captures students' cognitive advancement, evaluating whether students truly transition from confusion to comprehension, while the Scaffold Reward dynamically identifies each student's Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD), encouraging teachers to maintain productive teaching within this zone. We evaluate UCO by comparing it against 11 baseline models on BigMath and MathTutorBench benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate that our UCO model outperforms all models of equivalent scale and achieves performance comparable to advanced closed-source models.

However, this mechanism can introduce lip leaking, where generated lips are influenced by the reference image rather than solely by the driving audio. Such leakage is difficult to detect with standard metrics and conventional test setup. To address this, we propose a systematic evaluation methodology to analyze and quantify lip leakage. Our framework employs three complementary test setups: silent-input generation, mismatched audio-video pairing, and matched audio-video synthesis.

However, training remains computationally expensive, prior work reporting approximately 36 GPU-hours per dataset, limiting broader adoption and research. We propose CGAR, a novel training methodology that applies curriculum learning to architectural depth rather than traditional data ordering. CGAR introduces two synergistic components: Progressive Depth Curriculum dynamically adjusts recursion depth from shallow to deep configurations during training, preventing early overfitting while reducing computational cost, and Hierarchical Supervision Weighting applies exponentially decaying importance to supervision steps, aligning loss weighting with observed gradient magnitude decay. On Sudoku-Extreme with 423,168 test puzzles, CGAR achieves 1.71x training speedup (10.93 to 6.38 hours, 42% cost reduction) with only 0.63% accuracy drop (86.65% to 86.02%). Systematic ablations reveal Progressive Depth Curriculum alone achieves 2.26x speedup with 85.47% accuracy, demonstrating a rare Pareto improvement where architectural curriculum simultaneously enhances training efficiency and solution quality. CGAR-trained models exhibit superior inference efficiency with 100% halting accuracy and 11% fewer reasoning steps. Our work demonstrates that principled curriculum on architectural depth enables efficient training of recursive reasoning models on modest hardware.

However, existing methods often treat CLIP as a static feature extractor, overlooking its adaptability to neural representations and the inherent physiological-symbolic gap in EEG-image alignment. To address these challenges, we present NeuroCLIP, a prompt tuning framework tailored for EEG-to-image contrastive learning. Our approach introduces three core innovations: (1) We design a dual-stream visual embedding pipeline that combines dynamic filtering and token-level fusion to generate instance-level adaptive prompts, which guide the adjustment of patch embedding tokens based on image content, thereby enabling fine-grained modulation of visual representations under neural constraints; (2) We are the first to introduce visual prompt tokens into EEG-image alignment, acting as global, modality- level prompts that work in conjunction with instance-level adjustments. These visual prompt tokens are inserted into the Transformer architecture to facilitate neural-aware adaptation and parameter optimization at a global level; (3) Inspired by neuroscientific principles of human visual encoding, we propose a refined contrastive loss that better model the semantic ambiguity and cross-modal noise present in EEG signals. On the THINGS-EEG2 dataset, NeuroCLIP achieves a Top-1 accuracy of 63.2% in zero-shot image retrieval, surpassing the previous best method by +12.3%, and demonstrates strong generalization under inter-subject conditions (+4.6% Top-1), highlighting the potential of physiology-aware prompt tuning for bridging brain signals and visual semantics.", "AI": {"tldr": "NeuroCLIP\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u9488\u5bf9EEG-\u56fe\u50cf\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u8c03\u4f18\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u6d41\u89c6\u89c9\u5d4c\u5165\u3001\u89c6\u89c9\u63d0\u793a\u4ee4\u724c\u548c\u795e\u7ecf\u79d1\u5b66\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u5bf9\u6bd4\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8111\u7535\u4fe1\u53f7\u4e0e\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u4e49\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06CLIP\u89c6\u4e3a\u9759\u6001\u7279\u5f81\u63d0\u53d6\u5668\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u5176\u5bf9\u795e\u7ecf\u8868\u5f81\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u4ee5\u53caEEG-\u56fe\u50cf\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e2d\u56fa\u6709\u7684\u751f\u7406-\u7b26\u53f7\u9e3f\u6c9f\u3002", "method": "1. \u53cc\u6d41\u89c6\u89c9\u5d4c\u5165\u7ba1\u9053\u7ed3\u5408\u52a8\u6001\u6ee4\u6ce2\u548c\u4ee4\u724c\u7ea7\u878d\u5408\u751f\u6210\u5b9e\u4f8b\u7ea7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u63d0\u793a\uff1b2. \u9996\u6b21\u5728EEG-\u56fe\u50cf\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e2d\u5f15\u5165\u89c6\u89c9\u63d0\u793a\u4ee4\u724c\uff1b3. \u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u795e\u7ecf\u79d1\u5b66\u539f\u7406\u7684\u6539\u8fdb\u5bf9\u6bd4\u635f\u5931\u3002", "result": "\u5728THINGS-EEG2\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cNeuroCLIP\u5728\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u56fe\u50cf\u68c0\u7d22\u4e2d\u8fbe\u523063.2%\u7684Top-1\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u6bd4\u4e4b\u524d\u6700\u4f73\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u534712.3%\uff0c\u5728\u8de8\u88ab\u8bd5\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u4e5f\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u751f\u7406\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u8c03\u4f18\u5728\u6865\u63a5\u8111\u4fe1\u53f7\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u4e49\u65b9\u9762\u5177\u6709\u5de8\u5927\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

Currently, scalable metrics for measuring aspirations are limited. This study adapts, translates, and evaluates Snyder's Hope Scale as a metric for measuring aspirations among 136 women learning programming online during a period of systemic educational restrictions in Afghanistan. The adapted scale demonstrated good reliability (Cronbach's \u03b1 = 0.78) and participants rated it as understandable and relevant.

It processes raw pixels at 5 Hz to produce precise 30 Hz keyboard-mouse actions and adaptively invokes reasoning only when necessary. Trained in Genshin Impact, Lumine successfully completes the entire five-hour Mondstadt main storyline on par with human-level efficiency and follows natural language instructions to perform a broad spectrum of tasks in both 3D open-world exploration and 2D GUI manipulation across collection, combat, puzzle-solving, and NPC interaction. In addition to its in-domain performance, Lumine demonstrates strong zero-shot cross-game generalization. Without any fine-tuning, it accomplishes 100-minute missions in Wuthering Waves and the full five-hour first chapter of Honkai: Star Rail.

This paper introduces MATRIX (Multi-Aerial TRacking In compleX environments), a comprehensive dataset featuring synchronized footage from eight drones with continuously changing positions, and a novel deep learning framework for multi-view detection and tracking. Unlike existing datasets that rely on static cameras or limited drone coverage, MATRIX provides a challenging scenario with 40 pedestrians and a significant architectural obstruction in an urban environment. Our framework addresses the unique challenges of dynamic drone-based surveillance through real-time camera calibration, feature-based image registration, and multi-view feature fusion in bird's-eye-view (BEV) representation. Experimental results demonstrate that while static camera methods maintain over 90\\% detection and tracking precision and accuracy metrics in a simplified MATRIX environment without an obstruction, 10 pedestrians and a much smaller observational area, their performance significantly degrades in the complex environment. Our proposed approach maintains robust performance with $\\sim$90\\% detection and tracking accuracy, as well as successfully tracks $\\sim$80\\% of trajectories under challenging conditions. Transfer learning experiments reveal strong generalization capabilities, with the pretrained model achieving much higher detection and tracking accuracy performance compared to training the model from scratch. Additionally, systematic camera dropout experiments reveal graceful performance degradation, demonstrating practical robustness for real-world deployments where camera failures may occur. The MATRIX dataset and framework provide essential benchmarks for advancing dynamic multi-view surveillance systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86MATRIX\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3\u591a\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u52a8\u6001\u76d1\u63a7\u4e2d\u7684\u884c\u4eba\u8ddf\u8e2a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u590d\u6742\u906e\u6321\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u4fdd\u6301\u7ea690%\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u8ddf\u8e2a\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u5904\u7406\u52a8\u6001\u76f8\u673a\u4f4d\u7f6e\u548c\u590d\u6742\u906e\u6321\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u80fd\u591f\u9002\u5e94\u52a8\u6001\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u76d1\u63a7\u73af\u5883\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMATRIX\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff088\u4e2a\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u540c\u6b65\u89c6\u9891\uff09\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5b9e\u65f6\u76f8\u673a\u6807\u5b9a\u3001\u57fa\u4e8e\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u914d\u51c6\u3001\u9e1f\u77b0\u56fe\u4e2d\u7684\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u7279\u5f81\u878d\u5408\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u590d\u6742\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u4fdd\u6301\u7ea690%\u68c0\u6d4b\u8ddf\u8e2a\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u8ddf\u8e2a\u7ea680%\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u76f8\u673a\u6545\u969c\u65f6\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u96c5\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "conclusion": "MATRIX\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u52a8\u6001\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u76d1\u63a7\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002"}}

Voluntary coordination among labs - including by way of joint safety testing, information sharing, and resource pooling - could reduce catastrophic and existential risks.

This paper explores how U.S. antitrust policy can evolve to accommodate AI safety cooperation without abandoning core competition principles. After outlining the risks of unconstrained AI development and the benefits of lab-lab coordination, the paper analyses potential antitrust concerns, including output restrictions, market allocation, and information sharing. It then surveys a range of legislative and regulatory reforms that could provide legal clarity and safe harbours that will encourage responsible collaboration.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63a2\u8ba8\u7f8e\u56fd\u53cd\u5784\u65ad\u653f\u7b56\u5982\u4f55\u6f14\u8fdb\u4ee5\u5bb9\u7eb3AI\u5b89\u5168\u5408\u4f5c\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4e0d\u653e\u5f03\u6838\u5fc3\u7ade\u4e89\u539f\u5219\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u65e0\u7ea6\u675fAI\u5f00\u53d1\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5ba4\u95f4\u534f\u8c03\u7684\u76ca\u5904\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u7acb\u6cd5\u548c\u76d1\u7ba1\u6539\u9769\u5efa\u8bae\u3002", "motivation": "\u524d\u6cbfAI\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5ba4\u9762\u4e34\u6fc0\u70c8\u7684\u5546\u4e1a\u7ade\u4e89\u538b\u529b\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u8fd9\u589e\u52a0\u4e86\u5b89\u5168\u98ce\u9669\u3002\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5ba4\u95f4\u7684\u81ea\u613f\u534f\u8c03\uff08\u5982\u8054\u5408\u5b89\u5168\u6d4b\u8bd5\u3001\u4fe1\u606f\u5171\u4eab\u548c\u8d44\u6e90\u6574\u5408\uff09\u53ef\u4ee5\u964d\u4f4e\u707e\u96be\u6027\u548c\u5b58\u5728\u6027\u98ce\u9669\uff0c\u4f46\u53cd\u5784\u65ad\u5ba1\u67e5\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u53ef\u80fd\u963b\u788d\u8fd9\u79cd\u5408\u4f5c\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u6587\u9996\u5148\u6982\u8ff0\u65e0\u7ea6\u675fAI\u5f00\u53d1\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u548c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5ba4\u95f4\u534f\u8c03\u7684\u76ca\u5904\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u5206\u6790\u6f5c\u5728\u7684\u53cd\u5784\u65ad\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u4ea7\u51fa\u9650\u5236\u3001\u5e02\u573a\u5206\u914d\u548c\u4fe1\u606f\u5171\u4eab\u3002\u6700\u540e\uff0c\u8c03\u67e5\u4e86\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u7acb\u6cd5\u548c\u76d1\u7ba1\u6539\u9769\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u4f9b\u6cd5\u5f8b\u660e\u786e\u6027\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u6e2f\uff0c\u9f13\u52b1\u8d1f\u8d23\u4efb\u7684\u5408\u4f5c\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u672c\u6587\u8bc6\u522b\u4e86\u53cd\u5784\u65ad\u653f\u7b56\u5728AI\u5b89\u5168\u5408\u4f5c\u4e2d\u7684\u969c\u788d\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u6539\u9769\u5efa\u8bae\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5ba4\u95f4\u7684\u534f\u8c03\u63d0\u4f9b\u6cd5\u5f8b\u4fdd\u969c\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u7ade\u4e89\u539f\u5219\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7f8e\u56fd\u53cd\u5784\u65ad\u653f\u7b56\u9700\u8981\u6f14\u8fdb\uff0c\u4ee5\u5bb9\u7eb3AI\u5b89\u5168\u5408\u4f5c\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7acb\u6cd5\u548c\u76d1\u7ba1\u6539\u9769\u63d0\u4f9b\u6cd5\u5f8b\u660e\u786e\u6027\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u6e2f\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u9f13\u52b1\u8d1f\u8d23\u4efb\u7684\u534f\u4f5c\uff0c\u964d\u4f4eAI\u5f00\u53d1\u4e2d\u7684\u707e\u96be\u6027\u548c\u5b58\u5728\u6027\u98ce\u9669\u3002"}}

This report introduces TabPFN-2.5, the next generation of our tabular foundation model, built for datasets with up to 50,000 data points and 2,000 features, a 20x increase in data cells compared to TabPFNv2. TabPFN-2.5 is now the leading method for the industry standard benchmark TabArena (which contains datasets with up to 100,000 training data points), substantially outperforming tuned tree-based models and matching the accuracy of AutoGluon 1.4, a complex four-hour tuned ensemble that even includes the previous TabPFNv2. Remarkably, default TabPFN-2.5 has a 100% win rate against default XGBoost on small to medium-sized classification datasets (<=10,000 data points, 500 features) and a 87% win rate on larger datasets up to 100K samples and 2K features (85% for regression). For production use cases, we introduce a new distillation engine that converts TabPFN-2.5 into a compact MLP or tree ensemble, preserving most of its accuracy while delivering orders-of-magnitude lower latency and plug-and-play deployment.

Classical rank-centric IR metrics (nDCG/MAP/MRR) are a poor fit for RAG, where LLMs consume a set of passages rather than a browsed list; position discounts and prevalence-blind aggregation miss what matters: whether the prompt at cutoff K contains the decisive evidence. Second, there is no standardized, reproducible way to build and audit golden sets. Third, leaderboards exist but lack end-to-end, on-corpus benchmarking that reflects production trade-offs. Fourth, how state-of-the-art embedding models handle proper-name identity signals and conversational noise remains opaque. To address these, we contribute: (1) RA-nWG@K, a rarity-aware, per-query-normalized set score, and operational ceilings via the pool-restricted oracle ceiling (PROC) and the percentage of PROC (%PROC) to separate retrieval from ordering headroom within a Cost-Latency-Quality (CLQ) lens; (2) rag-gs (MIT), a lean golden-set pipeline with Plackett-Luce listwise refinement whose iterative updates outperform single-shot LLM ranking; (3) a comprehensive benchmark on a production RAG (scientific-papers corpus) spanning dense retrieval, hybrid dense+BM25, embedding models and dimensions, cross-encoder rerankers, ANN (HNSW), and quantization; and (4) targeted diagnostics that quantify proper-name identity signal and conversational-noise sensitivity via identity-destroying and formatting ablations.

As a demonstration of this approach, the article itself is presented as an example of AI-assisted scholarship under reasonably detailed disclosure, with representative prompt logs and modification records included. Rather than taking a position for or against AI-assisted scholarship, the article outlines conditions under which such work can be evaluated on its own terms: through transparent documentation, verification-oriented review, and participation by methodologically committed scholars.

Although recent advances have improved accuracy, most approaches still treat forecasting as a static one-time mapping task, lacking the interaction, reasoning, and adaptability of human experts. This gap limits their usefulness in complex real-world environments. To address this, we propose AlphaCast, a human wisdom-large language model (LLM) intelligence co-reasoning framework that redefines forecasting as an interactive process. The key idea is to enable step-by-step collaboration between human wisdom and LLM intelligence to jointly prepare, generate, and verify forecasts. The framework consists of two stages: (1) automated prediction preparation, where AlphaCast builds a multi-source cognitive foundation comprising a feature set that captures key statistics and time patterns, a domain knowledge base distilled from corpora and historical series, a contextual repository that stores rich information for each time window, and a case base that retrieves optimal strategies via pattern clustering and matching; and (2) generative reasoning and reflective optimization, where AlphaCast integrates statistical temporal features, prior knowledge, contextual information, and forecasting strategies, triggering a meta-reasoning loop for continuous self-correction and strategy refinement. Extensive experiments on short- and long-term datasets show that AlphaCast consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in predictive accuracy.

Existing embedding-based CAD approaches continuously update a memory bank with new embeddings to adapt to sequential tasks. However, these methods require constructing class-specific sub-memory banks for each task, which restricts their flexibility and scalability. To address this limitation, we propose a novel CAD framework where all tasks share a unified memory bank. During training, the method incrementally updates embeddings within a fixed-size coreset, enabling continuous knowledge acquisition from sequential tasks without task-specific memory fragmentation. In the inference phase, anomaly scores are computed via a nearest-neighbor matching mechanism, achieving state-of-the-art detection accuracy. We validate the method through comprehensive experiments on MVTec AD and Visa datasets. Results show that our approach outperforms existing baselines, achieving average image-level AUROC scores of 0.972 (MVTec AD) and 0.891 (Visa). Notably, on a real-world electronic paper dataset, it demonstrates 100% accuracy in anomaly sample detection, confirming its robustness in practical scenarios.

While AI-generated podcasts have been discussed as tools, for instance in medical education, they have not yet been analysed as media. By uploading different types of text and analysing the generated outputs I show how the podcasts' structure is built around a fixed template. I also find that NotebookLM not only translates texts from other languages into a perky standardised Mid-Western American accent, it also translates cultural contexts to a white, educated, middle-class American default. This is a distinct development in how publics are shaped by media, marking a departure from the multiple public spheres that scholars have described in human podcasting from the early 2000s until today, where hosts spoke to specific communities and responded to listener comments, to an abstraction of the podcast genre.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u5206\u6790Google NotebookLM\u751f\u6210\u7684AI\u64ad\u5ba2\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u91c7\u7528\u56fa\u5b9a\u6a21\u677f\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5e76\u5c06\u4e0d\u540c\u8bed\u8a00\u548c\u6587\u5316\u80cc\u666f\u7684\u5185\u5bb9\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u4e3a\u7f8e\u56fd\u4e2d\u897f\u90e8\u53e3\u97f3\u548c\u767d\u4eba\u4e2d\u4ea7\u9636\u7ea7\u6587\u5316\u9ed8\u8ba4\u503c\uff0c\u8fd9\u6807\u5fd7\u7740\u64ad\u5ba2\u4ece\u591a\u5143\u516c\u5171\u9886\u57df\u5411\u62bd\u8c61\u5316\u7684\u8f6c\u53d8\u3002", "motivation": "\u5206\u6790AI\u751f\u6210\u64ad\u5ba2\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5a92\u4f53\u7684\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u4ec5\u4ec5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u63a2\u8ba8\u5176\u5982\u4f55\u5851\u9020\u516c\u5171\u9886\u57df\u548c\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u6587\u5316\u8868\u8fbe\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0a\u4f20\u4e0d\u540c\u7c7b\u578b\u6587\u672c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u751f\u6210\u7684\u64ad\u5ba2\u8f93\u51fa\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u5176\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u6587\u5316\u7ffb\u8bd1\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u64ad\u5ba2\u91c7\u7528\u56fa\u5b9a\u6a21\u677f\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5c06\u5185\u5bb9\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u4e3a\u7f8e\u56fd\u4e2d\u897f\u90e8\u53e3\u97f3\u548c\u767d\u4eba\u4e2d\u4ea7\u9636\u7ea7\u6587\u5316\u9ed8\u8ba4\u503c\uff0c\u504f\u79bb\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u64ad\u5ba2\u7684\u591a\u5143\u516c\u5171\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "conclusion": "AI\u751f\u6210\u64ad\u5ba2\u6807\u5fd7\u7740\u64ad\u5ba2\u4ece\u7279\u5b9a\u793e\u533a\u5bf9\u8bdd\u5411\u62bd\u8c61\u5316\u7c7b\u578b\u7684\u8f6c\u53d8\uff0c\u6539\u53d8\u4e86\u516c\u5171\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5f62\u6210\u65b9\u5f0f\u3002"}}

However, two key challenges hinder real-world deployment: (1) noisy or degraded sensory inputs from weather, motion blur, or hardware limitations, and (2) the need to issue timely yet reliable predictions that balance early alerts with false-alarm suppression. We propose a unified framework that integrates diffusion-based denoising with a time-aware actor-critic model to address these challenges. The diffusion module reconstructs noise-resilient image and object features through iterative refinement, preserving critical motion and interaction cues under sensor degradation. In parallel, the actor-critic architecture leverages long-horizon temporal reasoning and time-weighted rewards to determine the optimal moment to raise an alert, aligning early detection with reliability. Experiments on three benchmark datasets (DAD, CCD, A3D) demonstrate state-of-the-art accuracy and significant gains in mean time-to-accident, while maintaining robust performance under Gaussian and impulse noise.

These efforts often operationalize justice at the upper and lower bounds of its continuum, defining it in terms of progressiveness or reform. Before characterizing the type of justice an AI tool should have baked in, we argue for a systematic discovery of how justice is executed by the recipient system: a method the Value Sensitive Design (VSD) framework terms Value Source analysis. The present work asks: how is justice operationalized within current child welfare administrative policy and what does it teach us about how to develop AI? We conduct a mixed-methods analysis of child welfare policy in the state of New York and find a range of functional definitions of justice (which we term principles). These principles reflect more nuanced understandings of justice across a spectrum of contexts: from established concepts like fairness and equity to less common foci like the proprietary rights of parents and children.

Code and data available at https://github.com/alvco/Founding_Fathers_AI", "summary": "Although Large Language Models (LLMs) show exceptional fluency, efforts persist to extract stronger reasoning capabilities from them. Drawing on search-based interpretations of LLM computation, this paper advances a systematic framework for understanding LLM reasoning and optimization. Namely, that enhancing reasoning is best achieved by structuring a multi-agent pipeline to ensure a traversal of the search space in a gradual, incremental, and sequential (GIS) manner. Stated succinctly, high-quality reasoning is a controlled, incremental search. To test this framework, we investigate the efficacy of recursive refinement (RR)--an iterative process of self-criticism, adversarial stress-testing, and integrating critical feedback--as a practical method for implementing GIS search. We designed an experiment comparing a simple, linear pipeline against a complex, explicitly structured pipeline leveraging a recursive refinement layer. The multi-agent models were constructed to reflect the historical personas of three US Founding Fathers (Hamilton, Jefferson, and Madison) using RAG-powered corpora and were prompted to generate responses to three contemporary political issues. Model performance was evaluated using a two-tiered approach: a quantitative score from an LLM arbiter agent and qualitative human judgment. Our results revealed that the complex model consistently outperformed the simple model across all nine test cases with an average arbiter-outputted score of 88.3 versus 71.7. The complex model's arguments were superior in analytical depth, structural nuance, and strategic framing.

However, existing methods are trained only on annotated object pairs and lack guidance for non-related pairs, making it difficult to identify meaningful relations during inference. In this paper, we propose Relation Scoring Network (RS-Net), a modular framework that scores the contextual importance of object pairs using both spatial interactions and long-range temporal context. RS-Net consists of a spatial context encoder with learnable context tokens and a temporal encoder that aggregates video-level information. The resulting relation scores are integrated into a unified triplet scoring mechanism to enhance relation prediction. RS-Net can be easily integrated into existing DSGG models without architectural changes. Experiments on the Action Genome dataset show that RS-Net consistently improves both Recall and Precision across diverse baselines, with notable gains in mean Recall, highlighting its ability to address the long-tailed distribution of relations. Despite the increased number of parameters, RS-Net maintains competitive efficiency, achieving superior performance over state-of-the-art methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faRS-Net\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7a7a\u95f4\u4ea4\u4e92\u548c\u957f\u7a0b\u65f6\u5e8f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5bf9\u7269\u4f53\u5bf9\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u8fdb\u884c\u8bc4\u5206\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u52a8\u6001\u573a\u666f\u56fe\u751f\u6210\u6027\u80fd", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709DSGG\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ec5\u5728\u6709\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u7269\u4f53\u5bf9\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u975e\u76f8\u5173\u7269\u4f53\u5bf9\u7684\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u96be\u4ee5\u8bc6\u522b\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u5173\u7cfb", "method": "RS-Net\u5305\u542b\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff08\u542b\u53ef\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6807\u8bb0\uff09\u548c\u65f6\u5e8f\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u4e09\u5143\u7ec4\u8bc4\u5206\u673a\u5236\u589e\u5f3a\u5173\u7cfb\u9884\u6d4b", "result": "\u5728Action Genome\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cRS-Net\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86Recall\u548cPrecision\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728mean Recall\u4e0a\u6709\u660e\u663e\u589e\u76ca\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5173\u7cfb\u957f\u5c3e\u5206\u5e03\u95ee\u9898", "conclusion": "RS-Net\u80fd\u8f7b\u677e\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u73b0\u6709DSGG\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u7ade\u4e89\u6027\u6548\u7387\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u4e8e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5"}}

While spatio-temporal features learned by foundation models have deepened general understanding of video content, sharing or storing these extracted visual features for downstream tasks inadvertently reveals sensitive personal information like skin color, gender, or clothing. Current privacy preservation methods focus on input-pixel-level anonymization, which requires retraining the entire utility video model and results in task-specific anonymization, making them unsuitable for recent video foundational models. To address these challenges, we introduce a lightweight Anonymizing Adapter Module (AAM) that removes private information from video features while retaining general task utility. AAM can be applied in a plug-and-play fashion to frozen video encoders, minimizing the computational burden of finetuning and re-extracting features. Our framework employs three newly designed training objectives: (1) a clip-level self-supervised privacy objective to reduce mutual information between static clips, (2) a co-training objective to retain utility across seen tasks, and (3) a latent consistency loss for generalization on unseen tasks. Our extensive evaluations demonstrate a significant 35% reduction in privacy leakage while maintaining near-baseline utility performance across various downstream tasks: Action Recognition (Kinetics400, UCF101, HMDB51), Temporal Action Detection (THUMOS14), and Anomaly Detection (UCF-Crime). We also provide an analysis on anonymization for sensitive temporal attribute recognition.

The first method, termed Greedy Pair Coarsening (GPC), iteratively merges pairs of nodes that locally minimize a measure of distortion until the desired size is achieved. The second method, termed $k$-means Greedy Pair Coarsening (KGPC), leverages clustering based on pairwise distortion metrics to directly merge clusters of nodes. We provide conditions guaranteeing optimal coarsening for our methods and validate their performance on six large-scale datasets and a downstream clustering task.

However, once deployed on public roads, ADSs are inevitably exposed to diverse driving hazards that may compromise safety and degrade system performance. This raises a strong demand for resilience of ADSs, particularly the capability to continuously monitor driving hazards and adaptively respond to potential safety violations, which is crucial for maintaining robust driving behaviors in complex driving scenarios.\n  To bridge this gap, we propose a runtime resilience-oriented framework, Argus, to mitigate the driving hazards, thus preventing potential safety violations and improving the driving performance of an ADS. Argus continuously monitors the trajectories generated by the ADS for potential hazards and, whenever the EGO vehicle is deemed unsafe, seamlessly takes control through a hazard mitigator. We integrate Argus with three state-of-the-art end-to-end ADSs, i.e., TCP, UniAD and VAD. Our evaluation has demonstrated that Argus effectively and efficiently enhances the resilience of ADSs, improving the driving score of the ADS by up to 150.30% on average, and preventing up to 64.38% of the violations, with little additional time overhead.", "AI": {"tldr": "Argus\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u9762\u5411\u8fd0\u884c\u65f6\u5f39\u6027\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u7f13\u89e3\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u9a7e\u9a76\u5371\u9669\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6301\u7eed\u76d1\u63a7\u8f68\u8ff9\u5e76\u5728\u5fc5\u8981\u65f6\u63a5\u7ba1\u63a7\u5236\u6765\u9632\u6b62\u5b89\u5168\u8fdd\u89c4\u3002", "motivation": "\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u516c\u5171\u9053\u8def\u4e0a\u90e8\u7f72\u65f6\u9762\u4e34\u5404\u79cd\u9a7e\u9a76\u5371\u9669\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5177\u5907\u6301\u7eed\u76d1\u63a7\u5371\u9669\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u54cd\u5e94\u5b89\u5168\u8fdd\u89c4\u7684\u5f39\u6027\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faArgus\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6301\u7eed\u76d1\u63a7ADS\u751f\u6210\u7684\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u5f53EGO\u8f66\u8f86\u88ab\u8ba4\u4e3a\u4e0d\u5b89\u5168\u65f6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5371\u9669\u7f13\u89e3\u5668\u65e0\u7f1d\u63a5\u7ba1\u63a7\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u4e0eTCP\u3001UniAD\u548cVAD\u4e09\u4e2a\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u7aef\u5230\u7aefADS\u96c6\u6210\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793aArgus\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347ADS\u5f39\u6027\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u9a7e\u9a76\u5206\u6570\u63d0\u9ad8\u8fbe150.30%\uff0c\u9632\u6b62\u9ad8\u8fbe64.38%\u7684\u8fdd\u89c4\uff0c\u65f6\u95f4\u5f00\u9500\u5f88\u5c0f\u3002", "conclusion": "Argus\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u589e\u5f3a\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5f39\u6027\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u9a7e\u9a76\u6027\u80fd\u5e76\u51cf\u5c11\u5b89\u5168\u8fdd\u89c4\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u4ef7\u503c\u3002"}}

Starting with images at resolutions of 32x32, we train a family of Transformers using IsoFlops profiles across compute budgets up to 7e19 FLOPs and evaluate three distinct target metrics: next-pixel prediction objective, ImageNet classification accuracy, and generation quality measured by Fr'echet Distance. First, optimal scaling strategy is critically task-dependent. At a fixed 32x32 resolution alone, the optimal scaling properties for image classification and image generation diverge, where generation optimal setup requires the data size grow three to five times faster than for the classification optimal setup. Second, as image resolution increases, the optimal scaling strategy indicates that the model size must grow much faster than data size.

This transformation is driven by advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly Reinforcement Learning (RL), which allows AVs to navigate complex environments and make critical decisions in real time. However, conventional RL paradigms often suffer from poor sample efficiency and lack adaptability in dynamic emergency scenarios. This paper reviews next-generation AV optimization strategies to address these limitations. We analyze the shift from conventional RL to Diffusion Model (DM)-augmented RL, which enhances policy robustness through synthetic data generation, albeit with increased computational cost. Additionally, we explore the emerging paradigm of Large Language Model (LLM)-assisted In-Context Learning (ICL), which offers a lightweight and interpretable alternative by enabling rapid, on-the-fly adaptation without retraining.

For example, in face datasets for hair color classification, blond hair may be disproportionately associated with females, reinforcing stereotypes. A recent approach leverages the Stable Diffusion model to generate balanced training data, but these models often struggle to preserve the original data distribution. In this work, we explore multiple diffusion-finetuning techniques, e.g., LoRA and DreamBooth, to generate images that more accurately represent each training group by learning directly from their samples. Additionally, in order to prevent a single DreamBooth model from being overwhelmed by excessive intra-group variations, we explore a technique of clustering images within each group and train a DreamBooth model per cluster. These models are then used to generate group-balanced data for pretraining, followed by fine-tuning on real data. Experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that the studied finetuning approaches outperform vanilla Stable Diffusion on average and achieve results comparable to SOTA debiasing techniques like Group-DRO, while surpassing them as the dataset bias severity increases.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u4f7f\u7528\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5fae\u8c03\u6280\u672f\uff08\u5982LoRA\u548cDreamBooth\uff09\u6765\u751f\u6210\u5e73\u8861\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u7fa4\u4f53\u504f\u89c1\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u805a\u7c7b\u548c\u6bcf\u4e2a\u805a\u7c7b\u8bad\u7ec3\u5355\u72ec\u7684DreamBooth\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u539f\u59cbStable Diffusion\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4e25\u91cd\u504f\u89c1\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u8d85\u8d8a\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u53bb\u504f\u6280\u672f\u3002", "motivation": "\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u7cfb\u7edf\u7ecf\u5e38\u56e0\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u7fa4\u4f53\u5206\u5e03\u4e0d\u5747\u800c\u7ee7\u627f\u504f\u89c1\uff0c\u4f8b\u5982\u4eba\u8138\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d\u91d1\u53d1\u4e0e\u5973\u6027\u7684\u8fc7\u5ea6\u5173\u8054\u4f1a\u5f3a\u5316\u523b\u677f\u5370\u8c61\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f7f\u7528Stable Diffusion\u751f\u6210\u5e73\u8861\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6a21\u578b\u96be\u4ee5\u4fdd\u6301\u539f\u59cb\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u3002", "method": "\u63a2\u7d22\u591a\u79cd\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5fae\u8c03\u6280\u672f\uff08LoRA\u548cDreamBooth\uff09\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u4ece\u8bad\u7ec3\u6837\u672c\u5b66\u4e60\u4ee5\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u5730\u8868\u793a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u7fa4\u4f53\u3002\u4e3a\u9632\u6b62\u5355\u4e2aDreamBooth\u6a21\u578b\u88ab\u7ec4\u5185\u53d8\u5f02\u6df9\u6ca1\uff0c\u5bf9\u6bcf\u4e2a\u7fa4\u4f53\u5185\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u8fdb\u884c\u805a\u7c7b\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u805a\u7c7b\u8bad\u7ec3\u5355\u72ec\u7684DreamBooth\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u7fa4\u4f53\u5e73\u8861\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5fae\u8c03\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6240\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u5fae\u8c03\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e73\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u539f\u59cbStable Diffusion\uff0c\u4e0e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u53bb\u504f\u6280\u672f\uff08\u5982Group-DRO\uff09\u7ed3\u679c\u76f8\u5f53\uff0c\u4e14\u5728\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u504f\u89c1\u4e25\u91cd\u7a0b\u5ea6\u589e\u52a0\u65f6\u8d85\u8d8a\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6280\u672f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5fae\u8c03\u6280\u672f\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u751f\u6210\u5e73\u8861\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u7f13\u89e3\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u7fa4\u4f53\u504f\u89c1\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u4e25\u91cd\u504f\u89c1\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

While recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have opened new opportunities for automation, the generalization ability and data efficiency of existing LLM-based methods are still limited, asmost require vast amounts of annotated or synthetic data, resulting in high costs and scalability barriers. In this work, we present OR-R1, a data-efficient training framework for automated optimization modeling and solving. OR-R1 first employs supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to help the model acquire the essential reasoning patterns for problem formulation and code generation from limited labeled data. In addition, it improves the capability and consistency through Test-Time Group Relative Policy Optimization (TGRPO). This two-stage design enables OR-R1 to leverage both scarce labeled and abundant unlabeled data for effective learning. Experiments show that OR-R1 achieves state-of-the-art performance with an average solving accuracy of $67.7\\%$, using only $1/10$ the synthetic data required by prior methods such as ORLM, exceeding ORLM's solving accuracy by up to $4.2\\%$. Remarkably, OR-R1 outperforms ORLM by over $2.4\\%$ with just $100$ synthetic samples. Furthermore, TGRPO contributes an additional $3.1\\%-6.4\\%$ improvement in accuracy, significantly narrowing the gap between single-attempt (Pass@1) and multi-attempt (Pass@8) performance from $13\\%$ to $7\\%$. Extensive evaluations across diverse real-world benchmarks demonstrate that OR-R1 provides a robust, scalable, and cost-effective solution for automated OR optimization problem modeling and solving, lowering the expertise and data barriers for industrial OR applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "OR-R1\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u4f18\u5316\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0e\u6c42\u89e3\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u548c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u7ec4\u76f8\u5bf9\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u4ec5\u97001/10\u7684\u6570\u636e\u91cf\u5c31\u80fd\u8fbe\u523067.7%\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u6c42\u89e3\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5ORLM 4.2%\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u5efa\u6a21\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u6807\u6ce8\u6216\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u4e14\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u5dee\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u6570\u636e\u6548\u7387\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u9996\u5148\u4f7f\u7528\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u4ece\u6709\u9650\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u95ee\u9898\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u901a\u8fc7\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u7ec4\u76f8\u5bf9\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u5347\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "result": "OR-R1\u4ec5\u7528100\u4e2a\u5408\u6210\u6837\u672c\u5c31\u8d85\u8d8aORLM 2.4%\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u6c42\u89e3\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u8fbe67.7%\uff0c\u6bd4ORLM\u9ad84.2%\u3002TGRPO\u989d\u5916\u8d21\u732e3.1%-6.4%\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u5c06\u5355\u6b21\u5c1d\u8bd5\u4e0e\u591a\u6b21\u5c1d\u8bd5\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u8ddd\u4ece13%\u7f29\u5c0f\u52307%\u3002", "conclusion": "OR-R1\u4e3a\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u8fd0\u7b79\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u6c42\u89e3\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7a33\u5065\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u4e14\u6210\u672c\u6548\u76ca\u9ad8\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u5de5\u4e1a\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u6240\u9700\u7684\u6570\u636e\u548c\u4e13\u4e1a\u77e5\u8bc6\u95e8\u69db\u3002"}}

For scalar quantizers, posterior-expected MSE yields closed-form tables; task-aware proxies are handled by short Monte Carlo on a small calibration set. An optional calibration-only distillation aligns the quantized model with the posterior predictive teacher. At matched average bits/weight of 3.0/3.5/4.0, BayesQ improves over strong PTQ baselines on ResNet-50 (ImageNet) and BERT-base (GLUE) e.g., vs. GPTQ by $+1.5/+0.7/+0.3$ top-1 percentage points on RN50 and $+1.1/+0.4/+0.2$ GLUE points on BERT, while requiring one-time preprocessing comparable to a GPTQ pass.

We explicitly model how inter-agent coordination structures evolve over time. While most MARL approaches rely on static or per-step relational graphs, they overlook the temporal evolution of interactions that naturally arise as agents adapt, move, or reorganize cooperation strategies. Capturing such evolving dependencies is key to achieving robust and adaptive coordination. To this end, TIGER constructs dynamic temporal graphs of MARL agents, connecting their current and historical interactions. It then employs a temporal attention-based encoder to aggregate information across these structural and temporal neighborhoods, yielding time-aware agent embeddings that guide cooperative policy learning. Through extensive experiments on two coordination-intensive benchmarks, we show that TIGER consistently outperforms diverse value-decomposition and graph-based MARL baselines in task performance and sample efficiency. Furthermore, we conduct comprehensive ablation studies to isolate the impact of key design parameters in TIGER, revealing how structural and temporal factors can jointly shape effective policy learning in MARL.

We propose a paradigm shift from \"model training\" to \"model raising\", in which alignment is woven into a model's development from the start. We identify several key components for this paradigm, all centered around redesigning the training corpus: reframing training data from a first-person perspective, recontextualizing information as lived experience, simulating social interactions, and scaffolding the ordering of training data. We expect that this redesign of the training corpus will lead to an early commitment to values from the first training token onward, such that knowledge, skills, and values are intrinsically much harder to separate.

However, LRMs such as DeepSeek-R1 and OpenAI o1 often generate verbose responses containing redundant or irrelevant reasoning step-a phenomenon known as overthinking-which substantially increases computational costs. Prior efforts to mitigate this issue commonly incorporate length penalties into the reward function, but we find they frequently suffer from two critical issues: length collapse and training collapse, resulting in sub-optimal performance. To address them, we propose a pipeline for training a Conciseness Reward Model (CRM) that scores the conciseness of reasoning path. Additionally, we introduce a novel reward formulation named Conciseness Reward Function (CRF) with explicit dependency between the outcome reward and conciseness score, thereby fostering both more effective and more efficient reasoning. From a theoretical standpoint, we demonstrate the superiority of the new reward from the perspective of variance reduction and improved convergence properties.

Existing diffusion-based approaches focus rather on small camera movements in real scenes or only consider unnatural object-centric scenes, limiting their potential applications in real-world settings. In this paper we move away from these constrained regimes and propose a 3D diffusion model trained with image-only losses on a large-scale dataset of real-world, multi-category, unaligned, and casually acquired videos of everyday scenes. We propose DT-NVS, a 3D-aware diffusion model for generalized novel view synthesis that exploits a transformer-based architecture backbone. We make significant contributions to transformer and self-attention architectures to translate images to 3d representations, and novel camera conditioning strategies to allow training on real-world unaligned datasets. In addition, we introduce a novel training paradigm swapping the role of reference frame between the conditioning image and the sampled noisy input.

These systems work autonomously towards a defined goal with reduced external control. Despite their potential, one of their flaws is the insufficient reliability which makes them especially unsuitable for high-risk domains such as healthcare or process industry. Unreliable systems pose a risk in terms of unexpected behavior during operation and mitigation techniques are needed. In this work, we derive the main reliability challenges of agentic AI systems during operation based on their characteristics. We draw the connection to traditional AI systems and formulate a fundamental reliability challenge during operation which is inherent to traditional and agentic AI systems. As our main contribution, we propose a two-layered reliability monitoring framework for agentic AI systems which consists of a out-of-distribution detection layer for novel inputs and AI transparency layer to reveal internal operations. This two-layered monitoring approach gives a human operator the decision support which is needed to decide whether an output is potential unreliable or not and intervene.

However, these approaches often suffer from the loss of global pose information, making them incapable of distinguishing geometrically similar but spatially distinct structures. We identify that this limitation stems from the restricted receptive field in existing RI methods, leading to Wing-tip feature collapse, a failure to differentiate symmetric components (e.g., left and right airplane wings) due to indistinguishable local geometries. To overcome this challenge, we introduce the Shadow-informed Pose Feature (SiPF), which augments local RI descriptors with a globally consistent reference point (referred to as the 'shadow') derived from a learned shared rotation. This mechanism enables the model to preserve global pose awareness while maintaining rotation invariance. We further propose Rotation-invariant Attention Convolution (RIAttnConv), an attention-based operator that integrates SiPFs into the feature aggregation process, thereby enhancing the model's capacity to distinguish structurally similar components. Additionally, we design a task-adaptive shadow locating module based on the Bingham distribution over unit quaternions, which dynamically learns the optimal global rotation for constructing consistent shadows. Extensive experiments on 3D classification and part segmentation benchmarks demonstrate that our approach substantially outperforms existing RI methods, particularly in tasks requiring fine-grained spatial discrimination under arbitrary rotations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u65cb\u8f6c\u4e0d\u53d8\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u9634\u5f71\u4fe1\u606f\u59ff\u6001\u7279\u5f81(SiPF)\u548c\u65cb\u8f6c\u4e0d\u53d8\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5377\u79ef(RIAttnConv)\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u56e0\u611f\u53d7\u91ce\u53d7\u9650\u800c\u65e0\u6cd5\u533a\u5206\u51e0\u4f55\u76f8\u4f3c\u4f46\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0d\u540c\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65cb\u8f6c\u4e0d\u53d8\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f7f\u7528\u624b\u5de5\u5236\u4f5c\u7684\u65cb\u8f6c\u4e0d\u53d8\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u4f46\u4f1a\u4e22\u5931\u5168\u5c40\u59ff\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u533a\u5206\u51e0\u4f55\u76f8\u4f3c\u4f46\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u8fd9\u6e90\u4e8e\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u611f\u53d7\u91ce\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u7ffc\u5c16\u7279\u5f81\u5d29\u6e83\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u9634\u5f71\u4fe1\u606f\u59ff\u6001\u7279\u5f81(SiPF)\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5171\u4eab\u65cb\u8f6c\u751f\u6210\u5168\u5c40\u4e00\u81f4\u53c2\u8003\u70b9(\u9634\u5f71)\uff0c\u5c06\u5c40\u90e8\u65cb\u8f6c\u4e0d\u53d8\u63cf\u8ff0\u7b26\u4e0e\u5168\u5c40\u59ff\u6001\u611f\u77e5\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff1b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u65cb\u8f6c\u4e0d\u53d8\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5377\u79ef(RIAttnConv)\u96c6\u6210SiPF\uff1b\u57fa\u4e8eBingham\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u9634\u5f71\u5b9a\u4f4d\u6a21\u5757\u52a8\u6001\u5b66\u4e60\u6700\u4f18\u5168\u5c40\u65cb\u8f6c\u3002", "result": "\u57283D\u5206\u7c7b\u548c\u90e8\u4ef6\u5206\u5272\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65cb\u8f6c\u4e0d\u53d8\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u9700\u8981\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7a7a\u95f4\u533a\u5206\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u7a81\u51fa\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u9634\u5f71\u4fe1\u606f\u59ff\u6001\u7279\u5f81\u548c\u65cb\u8f6c\u4e0d\u53d8\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5377\u79ef\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u65cb\u8f6c\u4e0d\u53d8\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u59ff\u6001\u4fe1\u606f\u4e22\u5931\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4efb\u610f\u65cb\u8f6c\u4e0b\u533a\u5206\u7ed3\u6784\u76f8\u4f3c\u7ec4\u4ef6\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

We also show that the PH descriptors of (virtual) graph products contain strictly more information than the computation on individual graphs, whereas EC does not. Additionally, we provide algorithms to compute the PH diagrams of the product of vertex- and edge-level filtrations on the graph product. We also substantiate our theoretical analysis with empirical investigations on runtime analysis, expressivity, and graph classification performance.

We propose MedFuse, a framework for irregular clinical time series centered on the MuFuse (Multiplicative Embedding Fusion) module. MuFuse fuses value and feature embeddings through multiplicative modulation, preserving feature-specific information while modeling higher-order dependencies across features. Experiments on three real-world datasets covering both intensive and chronic care show that MedFuse consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on key predictive tasks.

This makes it especially desirable for resource-constrained fields such as the medical domain. While recent GNN-based approaches show promise, they suffer from two key limitations: (1) matrix-based node super-resolution that disregards graph structure and lacks permutation invariance; and (2) reliance on node representations to infer edge weights, which limits scalability and expressivity. In this work, we propose two GNN-agnostic frameworks to address these issues. First, Bi-SR introduces a bipartite graph connecting LR and HR nodes to enable structure-aware node super-resolution that preserves topology and permutation invariance. Second, DEFEND learns edge representations by mapping HR edges to nodes of a dual graph, allowing edge inference via standard node-based GNNs.

To tackle these challenges, we propose HyperD (Hybrid Periodic Decoupling), a novel framework that decouples traffic data into periodic and residual components. The periodic component is handled by the Hybrid Periodic Representation Module, which extracts fine-grained daily and weekly patterns using learnable periodic embeddings and spatial-temporal attention. The residual component, which captures non-periodic, high-frequency fluctuations, is modeled by the Frequency-Aware Residual Representation Module, leveraging complex-valued MLP in frequency domain. To enforce semantic separation between the two components, we further introduce a Dual-View Alignment Loss, which aligns low-frequency information with the periodic branch and high-frequency information with the residual branch. Extensive experiments on four real-world traffic datasets demonstrate that HyperD achieves state-of-the-art prediction accuracy, while offering superior robustness under disturbances and improved computational efficiency compared to existing methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "HyperD\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u4ea4\u901a\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u4ea4\u901a\u6570\u636e\u89e3\u8026\u4e3a\u5468\u671f\u6027\u548c\u6b8b\u5dee\u5206\u91cf\u6765\u5904\u7406\u590d\u6742\u7684\u65f6\u7a7a\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u548c\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u5468\u671f\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "motivation": "\u4ea4\u901a\u9884\u6d4b\u9762\u4e34\u590d\u6742\u7a7a\u95f4\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\u548c\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u5468\u671f\u6a21\u5f0f\u4e0e\u4e0d\u89c4\u5219\u6ce2\u52a8\u5171\u5b58\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u6709\u6548\u5206\u79bb\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6a21\u5f0f\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u9884\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faHyperD\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u6df7\u5408\u5468\u671f\u8868\u793a\u6a21\u5757\uff08\u5904\u7406\u5468\u671f\u6027\u5206\u91cf\uff09\u548c\u9891\u7387\u611f\u77e5\u6b8b\u5dee\u8868\u793a\u6a21\u5757\uff08\u5904\u7406\u975e\u5468\u671f\u6027\u6ce2\u52a8\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u53cc\u89c6\u56fe\u5bf9\u9f50\u635f\u5931\u786e\u4fdd\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u79bb\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u4ea4\u901a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cHyperD\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u5728\u5e72\u6270\u4e0b\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "HyperD\u901a\u8fc7\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u8026\u4ea4\u901a\u6570\u636e\u7684\u5468\u671f\u6027\u548c\u975e\u5468\u671f\u6027\u5206\u91cf\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u4ea4\u901a\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u667a\u80fd\u4ea4\u901a\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u6280\u672f\u652f\u6301\u3002"}}

Despite clinical diagnostic advancements, there have not been any substantial improvements to patient prognosis. Histopathological assessment of excised tumors is the first line of clinical diagnostic routine. We hypothesize that automated, robust, and accurate identification of distinct histological sub-regions within GBM could contribute to morphologically understanding this disease at scale. In this study, we designed a four-step deep learning approach to classify six (6) histopathological regions and quantitatively evaluated it on the BraTS-Path 2024 challenge dataset, which includes digitized Hematoxylin \\& Eosin (H\\&E) stained GBM tissue sections annotated for six distinct regions. We used the challenge's publicly available training dataset to develop and evaluate the effectiveness of several variants of EfficientNet architectures (i.e., B0, B1, B2, B3, B4). EfficientNet-B1 and EfficientNet-B4 achieved the best performance, achieving an F1 score of 0.98 in a 5-fold cross-validation configuration using the BraTS-Path training set. The quantitative performance evaluation of our proposed approach with EfficientNet-B1 on the BraTS-Path hold-out validation data and the final hidden testing data yielded F1 scores of 0.546 and 0.517, respectively, for the associated 6-class classification task. The difference in the performance on training, validation, and testing data highlights the challenge of developing models that generalize well to new data, which is crucial for clinical applications.

However, forecasting SWE is challenging because SWE is influenced by various factors including topography and an array of environmental conditions, and has therefore been observed to be spatio-temporally variable. Classical approaches to SWE forecasting have not adequately utilized these spatial/temporal correlations, nor do they provide uncertainty estimates -- which can be of significant value to the decision maker. In this paper, we present ForeSWE, a new probabilistic spatio-temporal forecasting model that integrates deep learning and classical probabilistic techniques. The resulting model features a combination of an attention mechanism to integrate spatiotemporal features and interactions, alongside a Gaussian process module that provides principled quantification of prediction uncertainty. We evaluate the model on data from 512 Snow Telemetry (SNOTEL) stations in the Western US. The results show significant improvements in both forecasting accuracy and prediction interval compared to existing approaches. The results also serve to highlight the efficacy in uncertainty estimates between different approaches.

This creates a critical gap: while AI has substantially advanced quantitative methods, the qualitative dimensions essential for meaning-making and comprehensive scientific understanding remain poorly integrated. We argue for developing dedicated qualitative AI systems built from the ground up for interpretive research. Such systems must be transparent, reproducible, and privacy-friendly.

To address these challenges, we present EEG-X, a device-agnostic and noise-robust foundation model for EEG representation learning. EEG-X introduces a novel location-based channel embedding that encodes spatial information and improves generalization across domains and tasks by allowing the model to handle varying channel numbers, combinations, and recording lengths. To enhance robustness against noise, EEG-X employs a noise-aware masking and reconstruction strategy in both raw and latent spaces. Unlike previous models that mask and reconstruct raw noisy EEG signals, EEG-X is trained to reconstruct denoised signals obtained through an artifact removal process, ensuring that the learned representations focus on neural activity rather than noise. To further enhance reconstruction-based pretraining, EEG-X introduces a dictionary-inspired convolutional transformation (DiCT) layer that projects signals into a structured feature space before computing reconstruction (MSE) loss, reducing noise sensitivity and capturing frequency- and shape-aware similarities. Experiments on datasets collected from diverse devices show that EEG-X outperforms state-of-the-art methods across multiple downstream EEG tasks and excels in cross-domain settings where pre-trained and downstream datasets differ in electrode layouts.

However, implementing SCKD becomes exceedingly constrained in real-world scenarios due to the limited availability of paired modalities. To this end, we investigate a general and effective knowledge learning concept under weak semantic consistency, dubbed Asymmetric Cross-modal Knowledge Distillation (ACKD), aiming to bridge modalities with limited semantic overlap. Nevertheless, the shift from strong to weak semantic consistency improves flexibility but exacerbates challenges in knowledge transmission costs, which we rigorously verified based on optimal transport theory. To mitigate the issue, we further propose a framework, namely SemBridge, integrating a Student-Friendly Matching module and a Semantic-aware Knowledge Alignment module. The former leverages self-supervised learning to acquire semantic-based knowledge and provide personalized instruction for each student sample by dynamically selecting the relevant teacher samples.

While recent deep learning models have advanced automated staging, most rely solely on raw PSG signals and neglect contextual cues used by human experts. We propose a two-stage architecture that combines a Transformer-based per-epoch encoder with a 1D CNN aggregator, and systematically investigates the effect of incorporating explicit context: subject-level clinical metadata (age, sex, BMI) and per-epoch expert event annotations (apneas, desaturations, arousals, periodic breathing). Using the Sleep Heart Health Study (SHHS) cohort (n=8,357), we demonstrate that contextual fusion substantially improves staging accuracy. Compared to a PSG-only baseline (macro-F1 0.7745, micro-F1 0.8774), our final model achieves macro-F1 0.8031 and micro-F1 0.9051, with event annotations contributing the largest gains. Notably, feature fusion outperforms multi-task alternatives that predict the same auxiliary labels. These results highlight that augmenting learned representations with clinically meaningful features enhances both performance and interpretability, without modifying the PSG montage or requiring additional sensors.

We present a framework that enhances semi-supervised detection by fusing visual predictions with structural priors from text-pretrained LLMs via principled probabilistic weighting. Given unlabeled documents, an OCR-LLM pipeline infers hierarchical regions which are combined with teacher detector outputs through inverse-variance fusion to generate refined pseudo-labels.Our method demonstrates consistent gains across model scales. With a lightweight SwiftFormer backbone (26M params), we achieve 88.2$\\pm$0.3 AP using only 5\\% labels on PubLayNet. When applied to document-pretrained LayoutLMv3 (133M params), our fusion framework reaches 89.7$\\pm$0.4 AP, surpassing both LayoutLMv3 with standard semi-supervised learning (89.1$\\pm$0.4 AP, p=0.02) and matching UDOP~\\cite{udop} (89.8 AP) which requires 100M+ pages of multimodal pretraining. This demonstrates that LLM structural priors are complementary to both lightweight and pretrained architectures. Key findings include: (1) learned instance-adaptive gating improves over fixed weights by +0.9 AP with data-dependent PAC bounds correctly predicting convergence; (2) open-source LLMs enable privacy-preserving deployment with minimal loss (Llama-3-70B: 87.1 AP lightweight, 89.4 AP with LayoutLMv3); (3) LLMs provide targeted semantic disambiguation (18.7\\% of cases, +3.8 AP gain) beyond simple text heuristics.Total system cost includes \\$12 for GPT-4o-mini API or 17 GPU-hours for local Llama-3-70B per 50K pages, amortized across training runs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u878d\u5408\u89c6\u89c9\u9884\u6d4b\u548cLLM\u7ed3\u6784\u5148\u9a8c\u7684\u534a\u76d1\u7763\u6587\u6863\u5e03\u5c40\u7406\u89e3\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6982\u7387\u52a0\u6743\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u5347\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5728\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u548c\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u67b6\u6784\u4e0a\u5747\u53d6\u5f97\u663e\u8457\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u6587\u6863\u5e03\u5c40\u7406\u89e3\u4ecd\u7136\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5c3d\u7ba1\u534a\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u6709\u6240\u8fdb\u5c55\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u878d\u5408\u89c6\u89c9\u9884\u6d4b\u548cLLM\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\u6765\u51cf\u5c11\u5bf9\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528OCR-LLM\u7ba1\u9053\u63a8\u65ad\u6587\u6863\u7684\u5c42\u6b21\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u901a\u8fc7\u9006\u65b9\u5dee\u878d\u5408\u5c06\u6559\u5e08\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u8f93\u51fa\u4e0eLLM\u7ed3\u6784\u5148\u9a8c\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u7cbe\u70bc\u7684\u4f2a\u6807\u7b7e\u3002\u91c7\u7528\u5b9e\u4f8b\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u95e8\u63a7\u673a\u5236\u6539\u8fdb\u56fa\u5b9a\u6743\u91cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u5728PubLayNet\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u4ec5\u4f7f\u75285%\u6807\u7b7e\uff1a\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7SwiftFormer\u8fbe\u523088.2\u00b10.3 AP\uff1bLayoutLMv3\u8fbe\u523089.7\u00b10.4 AP\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u6807\u51c6\u534a\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60(89.1\u00b10.4 AP)\u5e76\u5339\u914d\u9700\u89811\u4ebf+\u9875\u9762\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684UDOP(89.8 AP)\u3002LLaMA-3-70B\u672c\u5730\u90e8\u7f72\u6548\u679c\u63a5\u8fd1GPT-4o-mini\u3002", "conclusion": "LLM\u7ed3\u6784\u5148\u9a8c\u4e0e\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u548c\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u67b6\u6784\u5177\u6709\u4e92\u8865\u6027\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u63d0\u4f9b\u8bed\u4e49\u6d88\u6b67\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5728\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6210\u672c\u53ef\u63a7\u3002"}}

We show that spectral predictability~$\u03a9$ -- a simple signal processing metric -- systematically stratifies model family performance, enabling fast model selection. We conduct controlled experiments in four different domains, then further expand our analysis to 51 models and 28 datasets from the GIFT-Eval benchmark. We find that large time series foundation models (TSFMs) systematically outperform lightweight task-trained baselines when $\u03a9$ is high, while their advantage vanishes as $\u03a9$ drops. Computing $\u03a9$ takes seconds per dataset, enabling practitioners to quickly assess whether their data suits TSFM approaches or whether simpler, cheaper models suffice. We demonstrate that $\u03a9$ stratifies model performance predictably, offering a practical first-pass filter that reduces validation costs while highlighting the need for models that excel on genuinely difficult (low-$\u03a9$) problems rather than merely optimizing easy ones.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u9891\u8c31\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u6307\u6807\u03a9\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u6a21\u578b\u9009\u62e9\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8be5\u6307\u6807\u80fd\u5728\u51e0\u79d2\u5185\u8bc4\u4f30\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u662f\u5426\u9002\u5408\u4f7f\u7528\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b(TSFMs)\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u6a21\u578b\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6210\u672c\u3002", "motivation": "\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\uff0c\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u9762\u4e34\u4e24\u96be\uff1a\u5168\u9762\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6570\u5341\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u8fc7\u9ad8\uff0c\u4f46\u9009\u62e9\u9519\u8bef\u6a21\u578b\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u6027\u80fd\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u5feb\u901f\u6709\u6548\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u9009\u62e9\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u9891\u8c31\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u6307\u6807\u03a9\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u5206\u5c42\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u9886\u57df\u8fdb\u884c\u63a7\u5236\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u5e76\u5728GIFT-Eval\u57fa\u51c6\u768451\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u548c28\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u6269\u5c55\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u5f53\u03a9\u503c\u9ad8\u65f6\uff0c\u5927\u578b\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b(TSFMs)\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5730\u4f18\u4e8e\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u4efb\u52a1\u8bad\u7ec3\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\uff1b\u5f53\u03a9\u503c\u964d\u4f4e\u65f6\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u4f18\u52bf\u6d88\u5931\u3002\u03a9\u8ba1\u7b97\u4ec5\u9700\u51e0\u79d2\uff0c\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u6307\u5bfc\u6a21\u578b\u9009\u62e9\u3002", "conclusion": "\u03a9\u6307\u6807\u80fd\u591f\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u5730\u5206\u5c42\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u521d\u6b65\u7b5b\u9009\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u65e2\u80fd\u964d\u4f4e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u53c8\u51f8\u663e\u4e86\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u5728\u771f\u6b63\u56f0\u96be(\u4f4e\u03a9)\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u3002"}}

Chawla"], "title": "CrochetBench: Can Vision-Language Models Move from Describing to Doing in Crochet Domain?", "comment": "code available at https://github.com/Peiyu-Georgia-Li/crochetBench", "summary": "We present CrochetBench, a benchmark for evaluating the ability of multimodal large language models to perform fine-grained, low-level procedural reasoning in the domain of crochet. Unlike prior benchmarks that focus on high-level description or visual question answering, CrochetBench shifts the emphasis from describing to doing: models are required to recognize stitches, select structurally appropriate instructions, and generate compilable crochet procedures. We adopt the CrochetPARADE DSL as our intermediate representation, enabling structural validation and functional evaluation via execution. The benchmark covers tasks including stitch classification, instruction grounding, and both natural language and image-to-DSL translation. Across all tasks, performance sharply declines as the evaluation shifts from surface-level similarity to executable correctness, exposing limitations in long-range symbolic reasoning and 3D-aware procedural synthesis. CrochetBench offers a new lens for assessing procedural competence in multimodal models and highlights the gap between surface-level understanding and executable precision in real-world creative domains.

Building upon our previous simulation study published in this journal, this study implements and evaluates the spectral-based approach on physical hardware to address this limitation. Specifically, this paper introduces HitoMi-Cam, a lightweight and shape-agnostic person detection method that uses the spectral reflectance properties of clothing. The author implemented the system on a resource-constrained edge device without a GPU to assess its practical viability. The results indicate that a processing speed of 23.2 frames per second (fps) (253x190 pixels) is achievable, suggesting that the method can be used for real-time applications. In a simulated search and rescue scenario where the performance of CNNs declines, HitoMi-Cam achieved an average precision (AP) of 93.5%, surpassing that of the compared CNN models (best AP of 53.8%). Throughout all evaluation scenarios, the occurrence of false positives remained minimal. This study positions the HitoMi-Cam method not as a replacement for CNN-based detectors but as a complementary tool under specific conditions. The results indicate that spectral-based person detection can be a viable option for real-time operation on edge devices in real-world environments where shapes are unpredictable, such as disaster rescue.", "AI": {"tldr": "HitoMi-Cam\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5149\u8c31\u53cd\u5c04\u7279\u6027\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u3001\u5f62\u72b6\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u4eba\u4f53\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53ef\u5728\u65e0GPU\u7684\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b9e\u65f6\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u5728\u5f62\u72b6\u4e0d\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u573a\u666f\uff08\u5982\u707e\u96be\u6551\u63f4\uff09\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8eCNN\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3CNN\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u5f62\u72b6\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u672a\u5305\u542b\u7684\u59ff\u6001\u4e0b\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5f62\u72b6\u4e0d\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u73af\u5883\uff08\u5982\u707e\u96be\u6551\u63f4\uff09\u4e2d\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u670d\u88c5\u5149\u8c31\u53cd\u5c04\u7279\u6027\u7684\u5149\u8c31\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u65e0\u9700GPU\u652f\u6301\u3002", "result": "\u5904\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u8fbe\u523023.2 fps\uff08253x190\u50cf\u7d20\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u6a21\u62df\u641c\u6551\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5e73\u5747\u7cbe\u5ea6\u8fbe\u523093.5%\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u5bf9\u6bd4\u7684CNN\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u6700\u4f73\u7cbe\u5ea653.8%\uff09\uff0c\u8bef\u62a5\u7387\u6781\u4f4e\u3002", "conclusion": "HitoMi-Cam\u4e0d\u662f\u66ff\u4ee3CNN\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u5728\u7279\u5b9a\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff08\u5982\u5f62\u72b6\u4e0d\u53ef\u9884\u6d4b\u73af\u5883\uff09\u7684\u8865\u5145\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u5149\u8c31\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u5b9e\u65f6\u64cd\u4f5c\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u53ef\u884c\u6027\u3002"}}

We curate a multimodal dataset covering 12 demographic subgroups defined by age, gender, and posture. FAST-CAD employs self-supervised encoders with adversarial domain discrimination to learn demographic-invariant representations, while Group-DRO optimizes worst-group risk to ensure robust performance across all subgroups.

We propose a complementary, architecture-agnostic approach that enhances safety through the aggregation of multiple generative models, with the aggregated model inheriting its safety from the safest subset of a given size among them. Specifically, we present a consensus sampling algorithm that, given $k$ models and a prompt, achieves risk competitive with the average risk of the safest $s$ of the $k$ models, where $s$ is a chosen parameter, while abstaining when there is insufficient agreement between them. The approach leverages the models' ability to compute output probabilities, and we bound the probability of abstention when sufficiently many models are safe and exhibit adequate agreement. The algorithm is inspired by the provable copyright protection algorithm of Vyas et al. (2023). It requires some overlap among safe models, offers no protection when all models are unsafe, and may accumulate risk over repeated use.

However, although these approaches perform well within training domains, they suffer from poor cross-domain generalization, often producing hallucinated content when encountering novel visual environments. Retrieval-based methods attempt to mitigate this limitation by leveraging external knowledge, but they can paradoxically exacerbate hallucination when retrieved captions contain entities irrelevant to the inputs. We introduce the concept of negative entities--objects that appear in generated caption but are absent from the input--and propose Negative Entity Suppression (NES) to tackle this challenge. NES seamlessly integrates three stages: (1) it employs synthetic images to ensure consistent image-to-text retrieval across both training and inference; (2) it filters negative entities from retrieved content to enhance accuracy; and (3) it applies attention-level suppression using identified negative entities to further minimize the impact of hallucination-prone features. Evaluation across multiple benchmarks demonstrates that NES maintains competitive in-domain performance while improving cross-domain transfer and reducing hallucination rates, achieving new state-of-the-art results in ZIC.

The aim is to create a theoretical foundation that describes the physical embodiment, sensory perception, ability to act, learning processes, and context sensitivity of intelligent systems within a coherent framework. While classical AI approaches rely on symbolic processing and data driven models, Physical AI understands intelligence as an emergent phenomenon of real interaction between body, environment, and experience. The six fundamentals presented here are embodiment, sensory perception, motor action, learning, autonomy, and context sensitivity, and form the conceptual basis for designing and evaluating physically intelligent systems. Theoretically, it is shown that these six principles do not represent loose functional modules but rather act as a closed control loop in which energy, information, control, and context are in constant interaction. This circular interaction enables a system to generate meaning not from databases, but from physical experience, a paradigm shift that understands intelligence as an physical embodied process. Physical AI understands learning not as parameter adjustment, but as a change in the structural coupling between agents and the environment. To illustrate this, the theoretical model is explained using a practical scenario: An adaptive assistant robot supports patients in a rehabilitation clinic. This example illustrates that physical intelligence does not arise from abstract calculation, but from immediate, embodied experience. It shows how the six fundamentals interact in a real system: embodiment as a prerequisite, perception as input, movement as expression, learning as adaptation, autonomy as regulation, and context as orientation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ece\u79d1\u5b66\u548c\u7cfb\u7edf\u89c6\u89d2\u9610\u8ff0\u4e86\u7269\u7406\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\uff08Physical AI\uff09\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u539f\u7406\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u4e3a\u667a\u80fd\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u7269\u7406\u4f53\u73b0\u3001\u611f\u77e5\u3001\u884c\u52a8\u3001\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u60c5\u5883\u654f\u611f\u6027\u521b\u5efa\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfAI\u4f9d\u8d56\u7b26\u53f7\u5904\u7406\u548c\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u800cPhysical AI\u5c06\u667a\u80fd\u7406\u89e3\u4e3a\u8eab\u4f53\u3001\u73af\u5883\u548c\u7ecf\u9a8c\u4e4b\u95f4\u771f\u5b9e\u4e92\u52a8\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u6d8c\u73b0\u73b0\u8c61\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5efa\u7acb\u65b0\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u516d\u4e2a\u57fa\u672c\u539f\u5219\uff1a\u5177\u8eab\u5316\u3001\u611f\u5b98\u611f\u77e5\u3001\u8fd0\u52a8\u884c\u52a8\u3001\u5b66\u4e60\u3001\u81ea\u4e3b\u6027\u548c\u60c5\u5883\u654f\u611f\u6027\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u539f\u5219\u6784\u6210\u5c01\u95ed\u63a7\u5236\u5faa\u73af\uff0c\u80fd\u91cf\u3001\u4fe1\u606f\u3001\u63a7\u5236\u548c\u60c5\u5883\u6301\u7eed\u4e92\u52a8\u3002", "result": "\u6784\u5efa\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5eb7\u590d\u8bca\u6240\u4e2d\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8f85\u52a9\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u6848\u4f8b\u8bf4\u660e\u7269\u7406\u667a\u80fd\u5982\u4f55\u4ece\u5177\u8eab\u4f53\u9a8c\u800c\u975e\u62bd\u8c61\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e2d\u4ea7\u751f\u3002", "conclusion": "Physical AI\u5c06\u667a\u80fd\u7406\u89e3\u4e3a\u7269\u7406\u5177\u8eab\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5b66\u4e60\u662f\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4e0e\u73af\u5883\u4e4b\u95f4\u7ed3\u6784\u8026\u5408\u7684\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u53c2\u6570\u8c03\u6574\uff0c\u8fd9\u4ee3\u8868\u4e86AI\u7814\u7a76\u8303\u5f0f\u7684\u8f6c\u53d8\u3002"}}

Given the resource constraints of these devices, quantization offers a promising solution by improving memory efficiency and reducing bandwidth requirements, thereby facilitating the deployment of VLMs. However, existing research has rarely explored aggressive quantization on VLMs, particularly for the models ranging from 1B to 2B parameters, which are more suitable for resource-constrained edge devices. In this paper, we propose SPEED-Q, a novel Staged Processing with Enhanced Distillation framework for VLM low-bit weight-only quantization that systematically addresses the following two critical obstacles: (1) significant discrepancies in quantization sensitivity between vision (ViT) and language (LLM) components in VLMs; (2) training instability arising from the reduced numerical precision inherent in low-bit quantization. In SPEED-Q, a staged sensitivity adaptive mechanism is introduced to effectively harmonize performance across different modalities. We further propose a distillation-enhanced quantization strategy to stabilize the training process and reduce data dependence. Together, SPEED-Q enables accurate, stable, and data-efficient quantization of complex VLMs. SPEED-Q is the first framework tailored for quantizing entire small-scale billion-parameter VLMs to low bits. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that SPEED-Q achieves up to 6x higher accuracy than existing quantization methods under 2-bit settings and consistently outperforms prior on-device VLMs under both 2-bit and 4-bit settings.

Results: In this application, we introduce DeepDR, the first integrated platform that combines a variety of established DL-based models for disease- and target-specific drug repositioning tasks. DeepDR leverages invaluable experience to recommend candidate drugs, which covers more than 15 networks and a comprehensive knowledge graph that includes 5.9 million edges across 107 types of relationships connecting drugs, diseases, proteins/genes, pathways, and expression from six existing databases and a large scientific corpus of 24 million PubMed publications.

However, the success of adversarial optimization has been largely limited to zero-sum settings because its naive application in cooperative settings leads to a critical failure mode: agents are irrationally incentivized to self-sabotage, blocking the completion of tasks and halting further learning. To address this, we introduce Rationality-preserving Policy Optimization (RPO), a formalism for adversarial optimization that avoids self-sabotage by ensuring agents remain rational--that is, their policies are optimal with respect to some possible partner policy. To solve RPO, we develop Rational Policy Gradient (RPG), which trains agents to maximize their own reward in a modified version of the original game in which we use opponent shaping techniques to optimize the adversarial objective. RPG enables us to extend a variety of existing adversarial optimization algorithms that, no longer subject to the limitations of self-sabotage, can find adversarial examples, improve robustness and adaptability, and learn diverse policies. We empirically validate that our approach achieves strong performance in several popular cooperative and general-sum environments.

Existing collaborative methods are dominantly built upon the de facto human-vision compression pipeline, witnessing deficiency on complexity and bit-rates when aggregating the machine-vision compression. Indeed, machine vision solely focuses on the core regions within the image/video, requiring much less information compared with the compressed information for human vision. In this paper, we thus set out the first successful attempt by a novel collaborative compression method based on the machine-vision-oriented compression, instead of human-vision pipeline. In other words, machine vision serves as the basis for human vision within collaborative compression. A plug-and-play variable bit-rate strategy is also developed for machine vision tasks. Then, we propose to progressively aggregate the semantics from the machine-vision compression, whilst seamlessly tailing the diffusion prior to restore high-fidelity details for human vision, thus named as diffusion-prior based feature compression for human and machine visions (Diff-FCHM). Experimental results verify the consistently superior performances of our Diff-FCHM, on both machine-vision and human-vision compression with remarkable margins.

Recently, diffusion models have been leveraged for their strong distribution-matching capabilities, enforcing conservatism through behavior policy constraints. However, existing methods often apply indiscriminate regularization to redundant actions in low-quality datasets, resulting in excessive conservatism and an imbalance between the expressiveness and efficiency of diffusion modeling. To address these issues, we propose DIffusion policies with Value-conditional Optimization (DIVO), a novel approach that leverages diffusion models to generate high-quality, broadly covered in-distribution state-action samples while facilitating efficient policy improvement. Specifically, DIVO introduces a binary-weighted mechanism that utilizes the advantage values of actions in the offline dataset to guide diffusion model training. This enables a more precise alignment with the dataset's distribution while selectively expanding the boundaries of high-advantage actions. During policy improvement, DIVO dynamically filters high-return-potential actions from the diffusion model, effectively guiding the learned policy toward better performance. This approach achieves a critical balance between conservatism and explorability in offline RL. We evaluate DIVO on the D4RL benchmark and compare it against state-of-the-art baselines. Empirical results demonstrate that DIVO achieves superior performance, delivering significant improvements in average returns across locomotion tasks and outperforming existing methods in the challenging AntMaze domain, where sparse rewards pose a major difficulty.", "AI": {"tldr": "DIVO\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u79bb\u7ebf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8e\u4f18\u52bf\u503c\u7684\u4e8c\u5143\u52a0\u6743\u673a\u5236\u6765\u6307\u5bfc\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\u8fc7\u5ea6\u4fdd\u5b88\u548c\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u8fbe\u6027\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u79bb\u7ebf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\uff0c\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u52a8\u4f5c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u4ef7\u503c\u9ad8\u4f30\u95ee\u9898\u4e25\u91cd\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u7b56\u7565\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5f80\u5f80\u5bf9\u4f4e\u8d28\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d\u7684\u5197\u4f59\u52a8\u4f5c\u8fdb\u884c\u65e0\u5dee\u522b\u6b63\u5219\u5316\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8fc7\u5ea6\u4fdd\u5b88\u548c\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u8fbe\u6027\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\u7684\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDIffusion policies with Value-conditional Optimization (DIVO)\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u5e7f\u6cdb\u8986\u76d6\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u5185\u72b6\u6001-\u52a8\u4f5c\u6837\u672c\u3002\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8e\u52a8\u4f5c\u4f18\u52bf\u503c\u7684\u4e8c\u5143\u52a0\u6743\u673a\u5236\u6765\u6307\u5bfc\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5728\u7b56\u7565\u6539\u8fdb\u9636\u6bb5\u52a8\u6001\u7b5b\u9009\u9ad8\u56de\u62a5\u6f5c\u529b\u7684\u52a8\u4f5c\u3002", "result": "\u5728D4RL\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cDIVO\u5728\u8fd0\u52a8\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u56de\u62a5\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u5728\u5177\u6709\u7a00\u758f\u5956\u52b1\u6311\u6218\u7684AntMaze\u9886\u57df\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "DIVO\u5728\u79bb\u7ebf\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4fdd\u5b88\u6027\u4e0e\u53ef\u63a2\u7d22\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u952e\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4ef7\u503c\u6761\u4ef6\u4f18\u5316\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u7b56\u7565\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

In this work, we theoretically and empirically compare two popular methods for escaping UHRs in breadth-first search (BrFS) and restarting random walks (RRWs). We first derive the expected runtime of escaping a UHR using BrFS and RRWs, based on properties of the UHR and the random walk procedure, and then use these results to identify when RRWs will be faster in expectation than BrFS. We then evaluate these methods for escaping UHRs by comparing standard EHC, which uses BrFS to escape UHRs, to variants of EHC called EHC-RRW, which use RRWs for that purpose. EHC-RRW is shown to have strong expected runtime guarantees in cases where EHC has previously been shown to be effective.

While trajectory-based and distribution-based step distillation methods offer solutions, they present a fundamental trade-off. Trajectory-based methods preserve global structure but act as a \"lossy compressor\", sacrificing high-frequency details. Conversely, distribution-based methods can achieve higher fidelity but often suffer from mode collapse and unstable training. This paper recasts them from independent paradigms into synergistic components within our novel Hierarchical Distillation (HD) framework. We leverage trajectory distillation not as a final generator, but to establish a structural ``sketch\", providing a near-optimal initialization for the subsequent distribution-based refinement stage. This strategy yields an ideal initial distribution that enhances the ceiling of overall performance. To further improve quality, we introduce and refine the adversarial training process. We find standard discriminator structures are ineffective at refining an already high-quality generator. To overcome this, we introduce the Adaptive Weighted Discriminator (AWD), tailored for the HD pipeline. By dynamically allocating token weights, AWD focuses on local imperfections, enabling efficient detail refinement. Our approach demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across diverse tasks. On ImageNet $256\\times256$, our single-step model achieves an FID of 2.26, rivaling its 250-step teacher. It also achieves promising results on the high-resolution text-to-image MJHQ benchmark, proving its generalizability.

TGPT is designed to understand and generate transaction trajectories while simultaneously supporting a variety of downstream prediction and classification tasks. We introduce a novel 3D-Transformer architecture specifically tailored for capturing the complex dynamics in payment transaction data. This architecture incorporates design innovations that enhance modality fusion and computational efficiency, while seamlessly enabling joint optimization with downstream objectives. Trained on billion-scale real-world transactions, TGPT significantly improves downstream classification performance against a competitive production model and exhibits advantages over baselines in generating future transactions.

NBVC can adopt bi-directional reference frames for better compression performance. However, NBVC's hierarchical coding may complicate continuous temporal prediction, especially at some hierarchical levels with a large frame span, which could cause the contribution of the two reference frames to be unbalanced. To optimize reference information utilization, we propose a novel NBVC method, termed Bi-directional Reference Harmonization Video Compression (BRHVC), with the proposed Bi-directional Motion Converge (BMC) and Bi-directional Contextual Fusion (BCF). BMC converges multiple optical flows in motion compression, leading to more accurate motion compensation on a larger scale. Then BCF explicitly models the weights of reference contexts under the guidance of motion compensation accuracy. With more efficient motions and contexts, BRHVC can effectively harmonize bi-directional references. Experimental results indicate that our BRHVC outperforms previous state-of-the-art NVC methods, even surpassing the traditional coding, VTM-RA (under random access configuration), on the HEVC datasets.

Existing defenses often attempt to identify and remove backdoor neurons based on Trigger-Activated Changes (TAC) which is the activation differences between clean and poisoned data. These methods suffer from low precision in identifying true backdoor neurons due to inaccurate estimation of TAC values. In this work, we propose a novel backdoor removal method by accurately reconstructing TAC values in the latent representation. Specifically, we formulate the minimal perturbation that forces clean data to be classified into a specific class as a convex quadratic optimization problem, whose optimal solution serves as a surrogate for TAC. We then identify the poisoned class by detecting statistically small $L^2$ norms of perturbations and leverage the perturbation of the poisoned class in fine-tuning to remove backdoors.

Fractal Generative Models (FGMs) are efficient in generating high-quality images, but their inherent self-similarity limits the diversity of output images. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach based on the Hausdorff Dimension (HD), a widely recognized concept in fractal geometry used to quantify structural complexity, which aids in enhancing the diversity of generated outputs. To incorporate HD into FGM, we propose a learnable HD estimation method that predicts HD directly from image embeddings, addressing computational cost concerns. However, simply introducing HD into a hybrid loss is insufficient to enhance diversity in FGMs due to: 1) degradation of image quality, and 2) limited improvement in generation diversity. To this end, during training, we adopt an HD-based loss with a monotonic momentum-driven scheduling strategy to progressively optimize the hyperparameters, obtaining optimal diversity without sacrificing visual quality. Moreover, during inference, we employ HD-guided rejection sampling to select geometrically richer outputs.

However, these static images, having almost lost their authentication attributes, cannot be reliably verified and are vulnerable to malicious copying and reuse. To address these issues, we propose AuthSig, a novel static electronic signature framework based on generative models and watermark, which binds authentication information to the signature image. Leveraging the human visual system's insensitivity to subtle style variations, AuthSig finely modulates style embeddings during generation to implicitly encode watermark bits-enforcing a One Signature, One Use policy.To overcome the scarcity of handwritten signature data and the limitations of traditional augmentation methods, we introduce a keypoint-driven data augmentation strategy that effectively enhances style diversity to support robust watermark embedding.

While diffusion-based anomaly detection has emerged as a promising approach for automated MA screening, its clinical application is hindered by three fundamental limitations. First, these models often fall prey to \"identity mapping\", where they inadvertently replicate the input image. Second, they struggle to distinguish MAs from other anomalies, leading to high false positives. Third, their suboptimal reconstruction of normal features hampers overall performance. To address these challenges, we propose a Wavelet Diffusion Transformer framework for MA Detection (WDT-MD), which features three key innovations: a noise-encoded image conditioning mechanism to avoid \"identity mapping\" by perturbing image conditions during training; pseudo-normal pattern synthesis via inpainting to introduce pixel-level supervision, enabling discrimination between MAs and other anomalies; and a wavelet diffusion Transformer architecture that combines the global modeling capability of diffusion Transformers with multi-scale wavelet analysis to enhance reconstruction of normal retinal features. Comprehensive experiments on the IDRiD and e-ophtha MA datasets demonstrate that WDT-MD outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both pixel-level and image-level MA detection. This advancement holds significant promise for improving early DR screening.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5c0f\u6ce2\u6269\u6563\u53d8\u6362\u5668\u7684\u5fae\u52a8\u8109\u7624\u68c0\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\uff08WDT-MD\uff09\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u4e09\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u95ee\u9898\uff1a\u8eab\u4efd\u6620\u5c04\u3001\u5047\u9633\u6027\u7387\u9ad8\u548c\u6b63\u5e38\u7279\u5f81\u91cd\u5efa\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002", "motivation": "\u5fae\u52a8\u8109\u7624\u662f\u7cd6\u5c3f\u75c5\u89c6\u7f51\u819c\u75c5\u53d8\u7684\u6700\u65e9\u75c5\u7406\u6807\u5fd7\uff0c\u4f46\u624b\u52a8\u7b5b\u67e5\u52b3\u52a8\u5f3a\u5ea6\u5927\u4e14\u6613\u51fa\u9519\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u8eab\u4efd\u6620\u5c04\u3001\u96be\u4ee5\u533a\u5206\u5fae\u52a8\u8109\u7624\u4e0e\u5176\u4ed6\u5f02\u5e38\u3001\u6b63\u5e38\u7279\u5f81\u91cd\u5efa\u4e0d\u4f73\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u963b\u788d\u4e86\u4e34\u5e8a\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faWDT-MD\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e09\u4e2a\u521b\u65b0\uff1a\u566a\u58f0\u7f16\u7801\u56fe\u50cf\u6761\u4ef6\u673a\u5236\u907f\u514d\u8eab\u4efd\u6620\u5c04\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7\u4fee\u590d\u5408\u6210\u4f2a\u6b63\u5e38\u6a21\u5f0f\u5f15\u5165\u50cf\u7d20\u7ea7\u76d1\u7763\uff1b\u7ed3\u5408\u6269\u6563\u53d8\u6362\u5668\u5168\u5c40\u5efa\u6a21\u80fd\u529b\u4e0e\u5c0f\u6ce2\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u5206\u6790\u7684\u5c0f\u6ce2\u6269\u6563\u53d8\u6362\u5668\u67b6\u6784\u3002", "result": "\u5728IDRiD\u548ce-ophtha MA\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u7efc\u5408\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cWDT-MD\u5728\u50cf\u7d20\u7ea7\u548c\u56fe\u50cf\u7ea7\u5fae\u52a8\u8109\u7624\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "WDT-MD\u6846\u67b6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u5fae\u52a8\u8109\u7624\u68c0\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5bf9\u6539\u8fdb\u65e9\u671f\u7cd6\u5c3f\u75c5\u89c6\u7f51\u819c\u75c5\u53d8\u7b5b\u67e5\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u524d\u666f\u3002"}}

BRIDGE trials recycle participant-level data from completed trials of AI models when legacy and updated models make concordant predictions, thereby reducing the enrollment requirement for subsequent trials. We provide a practical checklist for investigators to assess whether reusing data from previous trials allows for valid causal inference and preserves type I error. Using real-world datasets across breast cancer, cardiovascular disease, and sepsis, we demonstrate concordance between successive AI models, with up to 64.8% overlap in top 5% high-risk cohorts. We then simulate a series of breast cancer screening studies, where our design reduced required enrollment by 46.6%--saving over US$2.8 million--while maintaining 80% power.

Within the iterative-convolution thresholding method (ICTM) framework, we propose a variational segmentation model that integrates denoising terms. Specifically, the denoising component consists of an I-divergence term and an adaptive total-variation (TV) regularizer, making the model well suited to images contaminated by Gamma--distributed multiplicative noise and Poisson noise. A spatially adaptive weight derived from a gray-level indicator guides diffusion differently across regions of varying intensity. To further address intensity inhomogeneity, we estimate a smoothly varying bias field, which improves segmentation accuracy. Regions are represented by characteristic functions, with contour length encoded accordingly. For efficient optimization, we couple ICTM with a relaxed modified scalar auxiliary variable (RMSAV) scheme.

Current open-set object detectors, however, remain constrained by their exclusive reliance on positive indicators based on given prompts like text descriptions or visual exemplars. This positive-only paradigm experiences consistent vulnerability to visually similar but semantically different distractors. We propose T-Rex-Omni, a novel framework that addresses this limitation by incorporating negative visual prompts to negate hard negative distractors. Specifically, we first introduce a unified visual prompt encoder that jointly processes positive and negative visual prompts. Next, a training-free Negating Negative Computing (NNC) module is proposed to dynamically suppress negative responses during the probability computing stage. To further boost performance through fine-tuning, our Negating Negative Hinge (NNH) loss enforces discriminative margins between positive and negative embeddings. T-Rex-Omni supports flexible deployment in both positive-only and joint positive-negative inference modes, accommodating either user-specified or automatically generated negative examples. Extensive experiments demonstrate remarkable zero-shot detection performance, significantly narrowing the performance gap between visual-prompted and text-prompted methods while showing particular strength in long-tailed scenarios (51.2 AP_r on LVIS-minival).

However, training LLMs for AD faces significant challenges including high computation transmission costs, and privacy concerns associated with sensitive driving data. Federated Learning (FL) is promising for enabling autonomous vehicles (AVs) to collaboratively train models without sharing raw data. We present Federated LLM-based Autonomous Driving (FLAD), an FL framework that leverages distributed multimodal sensory data across AVs in heterogeneous environment. FLAD has three key innovations: (1) a cloud-edge-vehicle collaborative architecture that reduces communication delay and preserving data privacy; (2) an intelligent parallelized collaborative training with a communication scheduling mechanism that optimizes training efficiency, leveraging end-devices otherwise having insufficient resources for model training; and (3) a knowledge distillation method that personalizes LLM according to heterogeneous edge data. In addition, we prototype FLAD in a testbed with NVIDIA Jetsons, overcoming practical implementation challenges including CPU/GPU memory sharing in resource-constrained devices, dynamic model partitions, and fault-tolerant training.Extensive experimental evaluation demonstrates that FLAD achieves superior end-to-end AD performance while efficiently utilizing distributed vehicular resources, opening up new possibilities for future collaborative AD model training and knowledge sharing.", "AI": {"tldr": "FLAD\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u8054\u90a6\u5b66\u4e60\u7684LLM\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e91-\u8fb9-\u8f66\u534f\u540c\u67b6\u6784\u89e3\u51b3\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u4e2dLLM\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u4f20\u8f93\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u548c\u9690\u79c1\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u4e2dLLM\u8bad\u7ec3\u9762\u4e34\u7684\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u4f20\u8f93\u6210\u672c\u3001\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5229\u7528\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u6570\u636e\u8fdb\u884c\u534f\u4f5c\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u4e91-\u8fb9-\u8f66\u534f\u540c\u67b6\u6784\u51cf\u5c11\u901a\u4fe1\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff1b\u667a\u80fd\u5e76\u884c\u5316\u534f\u4f5c\u8bad\u7ec3\u4f18\u5316\u6548\u7387\uff1b\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2a\u6027\u5316LLM\u4ee5\u9002\u5e94\u5f02\u6784\u8fb9\u7f18\u6570\u636e\u3002", "result": "\u5728NVIDIA Jetsons\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5e73\u53f0\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u539f\u578b\uff0c\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc4\u4f30\u663e\u793aFLAD\u5728\u5b9e\u73b0\u4f18\u8d8a\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u9ad8\u6548\u5229\u7528\u5206\u5e03\u5f0f\u8f66\u8f86\u8d44\u6e90\u3002", "conclusion": "FLAD\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u534f\u4f5c\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u77e5\u8bc6\u5171\u4eab\u5f00\u8f9f\u4e86\u65b0\u53ef\u80fd\u6027\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u8bbe\u5907\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5b9e\u73b0\u6311\u6218\u3002"}}

Existing language-decoder based mitigation approaches often regulate visual or textual attention independently, overlooking their interaction as two key causal factors. To address this, we propose Owl (Bi-mOdal attention reWeighting for Layer-wise hallucination mitigation), a causally-grounded framework that models hallucination process via a structural causal graph, treating decomposed visual and textual attentions as mediators. We introduce VTACR (Visual-to-Textual Attention Contribution Ratio), a novel metric that quantifies the modality contribution imbalance during decoding. Our analysis reveals that hallucinations frequently occur in low-VTACR scenarios, where textual priors dominate and visual grounding is weakened. To mitigate this, we design a fine-grained attention intervention mechanism that dynamically adjusts token- and layer-wise attention guided by VTACR signals. Finally, we propose a dual-path contrastive decoding strategy: one path emphasizes visually grounded predictions, while the other amplifies hallucinated ones -- letting visual truth shine and hallucination collapse. Experimental results on the POPE and CHAIR benchmarks show that Owl achieves significant hallucination reduction, setting a new SOTA in faithfulness while preserving vision-language understanding capability.

Nevertheless, differences in data distribution (such as covariate and semantic shifts) severely affect its reliability in real-world deployments. To address this issue, we propose FedSDWC, a causal inference method that integrates both invariant and variant features. FedSDWC infers causal semantic representations by modeling the weak causal influence between invariant and variant features, effectively overcoming the limitations of existing invariant learning methods in accurately capturing invariant features and directly constructing causal representations. This approach significantly enhances FL's ability to generalize and detect OOD data. Theoretically, we derive FedSDWC's generalization error bound under specific conditions and, for the first time, establish its relationship with client prior distributions. Moreover, extensive experiments conducted on multiple benchmark datasets validate the superior performance of FedSDWC in handling covariate and semantic shifts.

Dueling bandit (DB) algorithms enable optimal decision-making in IPE building on pairwise comparisons. However, they remain inefficient when human feedback is sparse. Existing methods address sparsity by heavily relying on parametric reward models, whose rigid assumptions are vulnerable to misspecification.

Unlike the Euclidean distance of numerical attributes, the categorical attributes lack well-defined relationships of their possible values (also called categories interchangeably), which hampers the exploration of compact categorical data clusters. Although most attempts are made for developing appropriate distance metrics, they typically assume a fixed topological relationship between categories when learning distance metrics, which limits their adaptability to varying cluster structures and often leads to suboptimal clustering performance. This paper, therefore, breaks the intrinsic relationship tie of attribute categories and learns customized distance metrics suitable for flexibly and accurately revealing various cluster distributions. As a result, the fitting ability of the clustering algorithm is significantly enhanced, benefiting from the learnable category relationships. Moreover, the learned category relationships are proved to be Euclidean distance metric-compatible, enabling a seamless extension to mixed datasets that include both numerical and categorical attributes. Comparative experiments on 12 real benchmark datasets with significance tests show the superior clustering accuracy of the proposed method with an average ranking of 1.25, which is significantly higher than the 5.21 ranking of the current best-performing method.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5b66\u4e60\u53ef\u5b9a\u5236\u8ddd\u79bb\u5ea6\u91cf\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6539\u8fdb\u5206\u7c7b\u6570\u636e\u7684\u805a\u7c7b\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6253\u7834\u5c5e\u6027\u7c7b\u522b\u95f4\u7684\u56fa\u6709\u5173\u7cfb\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u5b66\u4e60\u9002\u5408\u4e0d\u540c\u805a\u7c7b\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u8ddd\u79bb\u5ea6\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u5206\u7c7b\u5c5e\u6027\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u805a\u7c7b\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u666e\u904d\u5b58\u5728\uff0c\u4f46\u7531\u4e8e\u7f3a\u4e4f\u660e\u786e\u5b9a\u4e49\u7684\u7c7b\u522b\u95f4\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u63a2\u7d22\u7d27\u51d1\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u6570\u636e\u805a\u7c7b\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u5047\u8bbe\u56fa\u5b9a\u7684\u7c7b\u522b\u62d3\u6251\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5176\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u805a\u7c7b\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u6253\u7834\u5c5e\u6027\u7c7b\u522b\u95f4\u7684\u56fa\u6709\u5173\u7cfb\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u5b66\u4e60\u9002\u5408\u7075\u6d3b\u51c6\u786e\u63ed\u793a\u5404\u79cd\u805a\u7c7b\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u81ea\u5b9a\u4e49\u8ddd\u79bb\u5ea6\u91cf\u3002\u5b66\u4e60\u5230\u7684\u7c7b\u522b\u5173\u7cfb\u88ab\u8bc1\u660e\u4e0e\u6b27\u51e0\u91cc\u5f97\u8ddd\u79bb\u5ea6\u91cf\u517c\u5bb9\uff0c\u53ef\u65e0\u7f1d\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u5305\u542b\u6570\u503c\u548c\u5206\u7c7b\u5c5e\u6027\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3002", "result": "\u572812\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u6bd4\u8f83\u5b9e\u9a8c\u548c\u663e\u8457\u6027\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u5177\u6709\u4f18\u8d8a\u7684\u805a\u7c7b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u6392\u540d\u4e3a1.25\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u9ad8\u4e8e\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u4f73\u65b9\u6cd5\u76845.21\u6392\u540d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5b66\u4e60\u53ef\u5b9a\u5236\u7684\u8ddd\u79bb\u5ea6\u91cf\u548c\u7c7b\u522b\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u805a\u7c7b\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u62df\u5408\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5728\u5206\u7c7b\u6570\u636e\u805a\u7c7b\u65b9\u9762\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u6539\u8fdb\u3002"}}

Recent work, Test-Time Counterattack (TTC), improves robustness by generating perturbations that maximize the embedding deviation of adversarial inputs using PGD, pushing them away from their adversarial representations. However, due to the fundamental difference in optimization objectives between adversarial attacks and counterattacks, generating counterattacks solely based on gradients with respect to the adversarial input confines the search to a narrow space. As a result, the counterattacks could overfit limited adversarial patterns and lack the diversity to fully neutralize a broad range of perturbations. In this work, we argue that enhancing the diversity and coverage of counterattacks is crucial to improving adversarial robustness in test-time defense. Accordingly, we propose Directional Orthogonal Counterattack (DOC), which augments counterattack optimization by incorporating orthogonal gradient directions and momentum-based updates. This design expands the exploration of the counterattack space and increases the diversity of perturbations, which facilitates the discovery of more generalizable counterattacks and ultimately improves the ability to neutralize adversarial perturbations. Meanwhile, we present a directional sensitivity score based on averaged cosine similarity to boost DOC by improving example discrimination and adaptively modulating the counterattack strength. Extensive experiments on 16 datasets demonstrate that DOC improves adversarial robustness under various attacks while maintaining competitive clean accuracy.

However, the VLM-generated labels exhibit dual limitations: low quality (i.e., label noise) and absence of error correction mechanisms. To enhance label quality, we propose Human-Corrected Labels (HCLs), a novel setting that efficient human correction for VLM-generated noisy labels. As shown in Figure 1(b), HCL strategically deploys human correction only for instances with VLM discrepancies, achieving both higher-quality annotations and reduced labor costs. Specifically, we theoretically derive a risk-consistent estimator that incorporates both human-corrected labels and VLM predictions to train classifiers. Besides, we further propose a conditional probability method to estimate the label distribution using a combination of VLM outputs and model predictions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves superior classification performance and is robust to label noise, validating the effectiveness of HCL in practical weak supervision scenarios.

In this paper, we explore Composition-Incremental Learning for Compositional Generalization (CompIL) in the context of the compositional zero-shot learning (CZSL) task, where models need to continually learn new compositions, intending to improve their compositional generalization capability progressively. To quantitatively evaluate CompIL, we develop a benchmark construction pipeline leveraging existing datasets, yielding MIT-States-CompIL and C-GQA-CompIL.

Prior methods--such as LocalNewton, LTDA, and FedSophia--have incorporated second-order optimization in FL by performing iterative local updates on clients and applying simple mixing of local parameters on the server. However, these methods often suffer from drift in local preconditioners, which significantly disrupts the convergence of parameter training, particularly in heterogeneous data settings. To overcome this issue, we refine the update rules by decomposing the ideal second-order update--computed using globally preconditioned global gradients--into parameter mixing on the server and local parameter updates on clients. As a result, our FedPM introduces preconditioned mixing of local parameters on the server, effectively mitigating drift in local preconditioners.\n  We provide a theoretical convergence analysis demonstrating a superlinear rate for strongly convex objectives in scenarios involving a single local update. To demonstrate the practical benefits of FedPM, we conducted extensive experiments.

While data poisoning attacks during RLHF/DPO alignment have been studied empirically, their theoretical foundations remain unclear. We investigate the minimum-cost poisoning attack required to steer an LLM's policy toward an attacker's target by flipping preference labels during RLHF/DPO, without altering the compared outputs. We formulate this as a convex optimization problem with linear constraints, deriving lower and upper bounds on the minimum attack cost. As a byproduct of this theoretical analysis, we show that any existing label-flipping attack can be post-processed via our proposed method to reduce the number of label flips required while preserving the intended poisoning effect. Empirical results demonstrate that this cost-minimization post-processing can significantly reduce poisoning costs over baselines, particularly when the reward model's feature dimension is small relative to the dataset size. These findings highlight fundamental vulnerabilities in RLHF/DPO pipelines and provide tools to evaluate their robustness against low-cost poisoning attacks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5728RLHF/DPO\u5bf9\u9f50\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u901a\u8fc7\u7ffb\u8f6c\u504f\u597d\u6807\u7b7e\u8fdb\u884c\u6700\u5c0f\u6210\u672c\u6570\u636e\u6295\u6bd2\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u4e86\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u672c\u7684\u4e0b\u754c\u548c\u4e0a\u754c\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540e\u5904\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u4ee5\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u6295\u6bd2\u6210\u672c\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u7684\u90e8\u7f72\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u7406\u89e3\u5176\u8106\u5f31\u6027\u53d8\u5f97\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u867d\u7136RLHF/DPO\u5bf9\u9f50\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u6570\u636e\u6295\u6bd2\u653b\u51fb\u5df2\u6709\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u4ecd\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u6700\u5c0f\u6210\u672c\u6295\u6bd2\u653b\u51fb\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u5177\u6709\u7ebf\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u51f8\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u672c\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u754c\u9650\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u540e\u5904\u7406\u65b9\u6cd5\u51cf\u5c11\u6240\u9700\u6807\u7b7e\u7ffb\u8f6c\u6b21\u6570\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\u4efb\u4f55\u73b0\u6709\u6807\u7b7e\u7ffb\u8f6c\u653b\u51fb\u90fd\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u540e\u5904\u7406\u51cf\u5c11\u6807\u7b7e\u7ffb\u8f6c\u6b21\u6570\uff0c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u6295\u6bd2\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u7279\u5f81\u7ef4\u5ea6\u76f8\u5bf9\u4e8e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u5927\u5c0f\u8f83\u5c0f\u65f6\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u4e9b\u53d1\u73b0\u63ed\u793a\u4e86RLHF/DPO\u6d41\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u8106\u5f31\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u8bc4\u4f30\u5176\u5bf9\u6297\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u6295\u6bd2\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

Traditional vision-based HMR methods sometimes face limitations in real-world scenarios due to mutual occlusions, insufficient lighting, and privacy concerns. Human-floor tactile interactions offer an occlusion-free and privacy-friendly alternative for capturing human motion. Existing research indicates that pressure signals acquired from tactile mats can effectively estimate human pose in single-person scenarios. However, when multiple individuals walk randomly on the mat simultaneously, how to distinguish intermingled pressure signals generated by different persons and subsequently acquire individual temporal pressure data remains a pending challenge for extending pressure-based HMR to the multi-person situation. In this paper, we present \\textbf{PressTrack-HMR}, a top-down pipeline that recovers multi-person global human meshes solely from pressure signals. This pipeline leverages a tracking-by-detection strategy to first identify and segment each individual's pressure signal from the raw pressure data, and subsequently performs HMR for each extracted individual signal. Furthermore, we build a multi-person interaction pressure dataset \\textbf{MIP}, which facilitates further research into pressure-based human motion analysis in multi-person scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that our method excels in multi-person HMR using pressure data, with 89.2~$mm$ MPJPE and 112.6~$mm$ WA-MPJPE$_{100}$, and these showcase the potential of tactile mats for ubiquitous, privacy-preserving multi-person action recognition.

While prior research has introduced various uncertainty bounds, most existing approaches require access to specific input features and rely on posterior mean and variance estimates or tuning hyperparameters. These limitations hinder robustness and fail to capture the model's global behavior in expectation. To address these limitations, we propose a chaining-based framework for estimating upper and lower bounds on the expected extreme values over unseen data, without requiring access to specific input locations. We provide kernel-specific refinements for commonly used kernels such as RBF and Mat\u00e9rn, in which our bounds are tighter than generic constructions. We further improve numerical tightness by avoiding analytical relaxations. In addition to global estimation, we also develop a novel method for local uncertainty quantification at specified inputs. This approach leverages chaining geometry through partition diameters, adapting to local structure without relying on posterior variance scaling.

Submitted to RA-L", "summary": "This article presents HOTFLoc++, an end-to-end framework for LiDAR place recognition, re-ranking, and 6-DoF metric localisation in forests. Leveraging an octree-based transformer, our approach extracts hierarchical local descriptors at multiple granularities to increase robustness to clutter, self-similarity, and viewpoint changes in challenging scenarios, including ground-to-ground and ground-to-aerial in forest and urban environments. We propose a learnable multi-scale geometric verification module to reduce re-ranking failures in the presence of degraded single-scale correspondences. Our coarse-to-fine registration approach achieves comparable or lower localisation errors to baselines, with runtime improvements of two orders of magnitude over RANSAC for dense point clouds.

The process of downsampling rich, internal latent states into discrete tokens inherently limits the depth and nuance of information that can be transmitted, thereby hindering collaborative problem-solving. Inspired by human mind-reading, we propose Interlat (Inter-agent Latent Space Communication), a paradigm that leverages the last hidden states of an LLM as a representation of its mind for direct transmission (termed latent communication). An additional compression process further compresses latent communication via entirely latent space reasoning. Experiments demonstrate that Interlat outperforms both fine-tuned chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting and single-agent baselines, promoting more exploratory behavior and enabling genuine utilization of latent information. Further compression not only substantially accelerates inference but also maintains competitive performance through an efficient information-preserving mechanism.

It helps reduce noise, improve generalization, and enhance interpretability. However, most existing unsupervised FS methods evaluate features in isolation, even though informative signals often emerge from groups of related features. For example, adjacent pixels, functionally connected brain regions, or correlated financial indicators tend to act together, making independent evaluation suboptimal. Although some methods attempt to capture group structure, they typically rely on predefined partitions or label supervision, limiting their applicability. We propose GroupFS, an end-to-end, fully differentiable framework that jointly discovers latent feature groups and selects the most informative groups among them, without relying on fixed a priori groups or label supervision. GroupFS enforces Laplacian smoothness on both feature and sample graphs and applies a group sparsity regularizer to learn a compact, structured representation.

However, reliable evaluation remains the primary bottleneck for responsible clinical deployment. We introduce a novel evaluation framework that combines DermBench, a meticulously curated benchmark, with DermEval, a robust automatic evaluator, to enable clinically meaningful, reproducible, and scalable assessment. We build DermBench, which pairs 4,000 real-world dermatology images with expert-certified diagnostic narratives and uses an LLM-based judge to score candidate narratives across clinically grounded dimensions, enabling consistent and comprehensive evaluation of multimodal models. For individual case assessment, we train DermEval, a reference-free multimodal evaluator. Given an image and a generated narrative, DermEval produces a structured critique along with an overall score and per-dimension ratings. This capability enables fine-grained, per-case analysis, which is critical for identifying model limitations and biases. Experiments on a diverse dataset of 4,500 cases demonstrate that DermBench and DermEval achieve close alignment with expert ratings, with mean deviations of 0.251 and 0.117 (out of 5), respectively, providing reliable measurement of diagnostic ability and trustworthiness across different multimodal LLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7ed3\u5408DermBench\u57fa\u51c6\u548cDermEval\u81ea\u52a8\u8bc4\u4f30\u5668\u7684\u76ae\u80a4\u75c5\u8bca\u65ad\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u53ef\u9760\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u7684\u76ae\u80a4\u75c5\u8bca\u65ad\u53d9\u8ff0\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8d8a\u6765\u8d8a\u591a\u5730\u7528\u4e8e\u76f4\u63a5\u4ece\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u76ae\u80a4\u75c5\u8bca\u65ad\u53d9\u8ff0\uff0c\u4f46\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u4ecd\u7136\u662f\u4e34\u5e8a\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u74f6\u9888\u3002", "method": "\u6784\u5efaDermBench\u57fa\u51c6\uff08\u5305\u542b4000\u5f20\u771f\u5b9e\u76ae\u80a4\u75c5\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u4e13\u5bb6\u8ba4\u8bc1\u7684\u8bca\u65ad\u53d9\u8ff0\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u8bc4\u5206\u5668\u5bf9\u5019\u9009\u53d9\u8ff0\u8fdb\u884c\u4e34\u5e8a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u8bc4\u5206\uff1b\u8bad\u7ec3DermEval\u65e0\u53c2\u8003\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8bc4\u4f30\u5668\uff0c\u6839\u636e\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u751f\u6210\u53d9\u8ff0\u4ea7\u751f\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6279\u8bc4\u548c\u8bc4\u5206\u3002", "result": "\u57284500\u4e2a\u75c5\u4f8b\u7684\u591a\u6837\u5316\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cDermBench\u548cDermEval\u4e0e\u4e13\u5bb6\u8bc4\u5206\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e00\u81f4\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u504f\u5dee\u5206\u522b\u4e3a0.251\u548c0.117\uff08\u6ee1\u52065\u5206\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u53ef\u9760\u5730\u6d4b\u91cf\u4e0d\u540c\u591a\u6a21\u6001LLM\u7684\u8bca\u65ad\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\uff0c\u4e3a\u4e34\u5e8a\u90e8\u7f72\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u91cd\u590d\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Existing cross-domain policy adaptation methods typically rely on a single simple filtering criterion to select source trajectory fragments and stitch them together. They match either state structure or action feasibility. However, the selected fragments still have poor stitchability: state structures can misalign, the return-to-go (RTG) becomes incomparable when the reward or horizon changes, and actions may jump at trajectory junctions. As a result, RTG tokens lose continuity, which compromises DT's inference ability. To tackle these challenges, we propose Data Fusion-Enhanced Decision Transformer (DFDT), a compact pipeline that restores stitchability. Particularly, DFDT fuses scarce target data with selectively trusted source fragments via a two-level data filter, maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) mismatch for state-structure alignment, and optimal transport (OT) deviation for action feasibility. It then trains on a feasibility-weighted fusion distribution. Furthermore, DFDT replaces RTG tokens with advantage-conditioned tokens, which improves the continuity of the semantics in the token sequence. It also applies a $Q$-guided regularizer to suppress junction value and action jumps. Theoretically, we provide bounds that tie state value and policy performance gaps to the MMD-mismatch and OT-deviation measures, and show that the bounds tighten as these two measures shrink.

FSampler maintains a short history of denoising signals (epsilon) from recent real model calls and extrapolates the next epsilon using finite difference predictors at second order, third order, or fourth order, falling back to lower order when history is insufficient. On selected steps the predicted epsilon substitutes the model call while keeping each sampler's update rule unchanged. Predicted epsilons are validated for finiteness and magnitude; a learning stabilizer rescales predictions on skipped steps to correct drift, and an optional gradient estimation stabilizer compensates local curvature. Protected windows, periodic anchors, and a cap on consecutive skips bound deviation over the trajectory. Operating at the sampler level, FSampler integrates with Euler/DDIM, DPM++ 2M/2S, LMS/AB2, and RES family exponential multistep methods and drops into standard workflows. FLUX.1 dev, Qwen Image, and Wan 2.2, FSampler reduces time by 8 to 22% and model calls by 15 to 25% at high fidelity (Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) 0.95 to 0.99), without altering sampler formulas.

To prevent illicit use, it is desirable to be able to detect AI-generated text. Training and evaluation of such detectors critically depend on suitable benchmark datasets. Several groups took on the tedious work of collecting, curating, and publishing large and diverse datasets for this task. However, it remains an open challenge to ensure high quality in all relevant aspects of such a dataset. For example, the DetectRL benchmark exhibits relatively simple patterns of AI-generation in 98.5% of the Claude-LLM data. These patterns may include introductory words such as \"Sure! Here is the academic article abstract:\", or instances where the LLM rejects the prompted task. In this work, we demonstrate that detectors trained on such data use such patterns as shortcuts, which facilitates spoofing attacks on the trained detectors. We consequently reprocessed the DetectRL dataset with several cleansing operations. Experiments show that such data cleansing makes direct attacks more difficult.

Mansourian", "Amir Mohammad Babaei", "Shohreh Kasaei"], "title": "Enriching Knowledge Distillation with Cross-Modal Teacher Fusion", "comment": "11 pages, 5 figures, 8 tables", "summary": "Multi-teacher knowledge distillation (KD), a more effective technique than traditional single-teacher methods, transfers knowledge from expert teachers to a compact student model using logit or feature matching. However, most existing approaches lack knowledge diversity, as they rely solely on unimodal visual information, overlooking the potential of cross-modal representations. In this work, we explore the use of CLIP's vision-language knowledge as a complementary source of supervision for KD, an area that remains largely underexplored. We propose a simple yet effective framework that fuses the logits and features of a conventional teacher with those from CLIP. By incorporating CLIP's multi-prompt textual guidance, the fused supervision captures both dataset-specific and semantically enriched visual cues. Beyond accuracy, analysis shows that the fused teacher yields more confident and reliable predictions, significantly increasing confident-correct cases while reducing confidently wrong ones. Moreover, fusion with CLIP refines the entire logit distribution, producing semantically meaningful probabilities for non-target classes, thereby improving inter-class consistency and distillation quality.

Our method seamlessly integrates with pretrained Trellis-based models (e.g., Trellis, DSO) without any architectural changes. In extensive evaluations, we achieve up to 43% reduction in material mass on the text-to-3D task.

Recently, Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown promise in accelerating MILP solvers by predicting high-quality solutions. However, we identify that existing methods misalign with the intrinsic structure of MILP problems at two levels. At the leaning objective level, the Binary Cross-Entropy (BCE) loss treats variables independently, neglecting their relative priority and yielding plausible logits. At the model architecture level, standard GNN message passing inherently smooths the representations across variables, missing the natural competitive relationships within constraints. To address these challenges, we propose CoCo-MILP, which explicitly models inter-variable Contrast and intra-constraint Competition for advanced MILP solution prediction. At the objective level, CoCo-MILP introduces the Inter-Variable Contrastive Loss (VCL), which explicitly maximizes the embedding margin between variables assigned one versus zero. At the architectural level, we design an Intra-Constraint Competitive GNN layer that, instead of homogenizing features, learns to differentiate representations of competing variables within a constraint, capturing their exclusionary nature. Experimental results on standard benchmarks demonstrate that CoCo-MILP significantly outperforms existing learning-based approaches, reducing the solution gap by up to 68.12% compared to traditional solvers.

When applied to medical image segmentation, the paradigm faces challenges due to inherent image ambiguities, making it particularly vulnerable to erroneous supervision. Crucially, the student's iterative reconfirmation of these errors leads to self-reinforcing bias. While some studies attempt to mitigate this bias, they often rely on external modifications to the conventional teacher-student framework, overlooking its intrinsic potential for error correction. In response, this work introduces a feedback mechanism into the teacher-student framework to counteract error reconfirmations. Here, the student provides feedback on the changes induced by the teacher's pseudo-labels, enabling the teacher to refine these labels accordingly. We specify that this interaction hinges on two key components: the feedback attributor, which designates pseudo-labels triggering the student's update, and the feedback receiver, which determines where to apply this feedback. Building on this, a dual-teacher feedback model is further proposed, which allows more dynamics in the feedback loop and fosters more gains by resolving disagreements through cross-teacher supervision while avoiding consistent errors.

To address this long-standing challenge, we propose a novel and fully parameter-free clustering framework via Self-supervised Consensus Maximization, named SCMax. Our framework performs hierarchical agglomerative clustering and cluster evaluation in a single, integrated process. At each step of agglomeration, it creates a new, structure-aware data representation through a self-supervised learning task guided by the current clustering structure. We then introduce a nearest neighbor consensus score, which measures the agreement between the nearest neighbor-based merge decisions suggested by the original representation and the self-supervised one. The moment at which consensus maximization occurs can serve as a criterion for determining the optimal number of clusters.

PETR and its variants (PETRs) excel in benchmarks but face deployment challenges due to high computational cost and memory footprint. Quantization is an effective technique for compressing deep neural networks by reducing the bit width of weights and activations. However, directly applying existing quantization methods to PETRs leads to severe accuracy degradation. This issue primarily arises from two key challenges: (1) significant magnitude disparity between multi-modal features-specifically, image features and camera-ray positional embeddings (PE), and (2) the inefficiency and approximation error of quantizing non-linear operators, which commonly rely on hardware-unfriendly computations. In this paper, we propose FQ-PETR, a fully quantized framework for PETRs, featuring three key innovations: (1) Quantization-Friendly LiDAR-ray Position Embedding (QFPE): Replacing multi-point sampling with LiDAR-prior-guided single-point sampling and anchor-based embedding eliminates problematic non-linearities (e.g., inverse-sigmoid) and aligns PE scale with image features, preserving accuracy. (2) Dual-Lookup Table (DULUT): This algorithm approximates complex non-linear functions using two cascaded linear LUTs, achieving high fidelity with minimal entries and no specialized hardware. (3) Quantization After Numerical Stabilization (QANS): Performing quantization after softmax numerical stabilization mitigates attention distortion from large inputs. On PETRs (e.g. PETR, StreamPETR, PETRv2, MV2d), FQ-PETR under W8A8 achieves near-floating-point accuracy (1% degradation) while reducing latency by up to 75%, significantly outperforming existing PTQ and QAT baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "FQ-PETR\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u9488\u5bf9PETR\u7cfb\u52173D\u68c0\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5168\u91cf\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u91cf\u5316\u53cb\u597d\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\u5d4c\u5165\u3001\u53cc\u67e5\u627e\u8868\u548c\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u7b97\u5b50\u91cf\u5316\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5728W8A8\u91cf\u5316\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u63a5\u8fd1\u6d6e\u70b9\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff08\u4ec51%\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\uff09\u548c75%\u5ef6\u8fdf\u964d\u4f4e\u3002", "motivation": "PETR\u7cfb\u5217\u6a21\u578b\u57283D\u68c0\u6d4b\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u9762\u4e34\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u5360\u7528\u7684\u90e8\u7f72\u6311\u6218\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f4\u63a5\u5e94\u7528\u4e8ePETR\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e25\u91cd\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u7531\u4e8e\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u7279\u5f81\u5e45\u5ea6\u5dee\u5f02\u548c\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u7b97\u5b50\u91cf\u5316\u6548\u7387\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e09\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u521b\u65b0\uff1a1\uff09\u91cf\u5316\u53cb\u597d\u7684LiDAR\u5c04\u7ebf\u4f4d\u7f6e\u5d4c\u5165\uff08QFPE\uff09\uff0c\u7528\u5355\u70b9\u91c7\u6837\u66ff\u4ee3\u591a\u70b9\u91c7\u6837\uff1b2\uff09\u53cc\u67e5\u627e\u8868\uff08DULUT\uff09\u7b97\u6cd5\u9ad8\u6548\u8fd1\u4f3c\u590d\u6742\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u51fd\u6570\uff1b3\uff09\u6570\u503c\u7a33\u5b9a\u540e\u91cf\u5316\uff08QANS\uff09\u51cf\u5c11\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5931\u771f\u3002", "result": "\u5728PETR\u3001StreamPETR\u3001PETRv2\u3001MV2d\u7b49\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\uff0cFQ-PETR\u5728W8A8\u91cf\u5316\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u63a5\u8fd1\u6d6e\u70b9\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff08\u4ec51%\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\uff09\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u51cf\u5c11\u5ef6\u8fdf\u8fbe75%\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709PTQ\u548cQAT\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "FQ-PETR\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86PETR\u7cfb\u5217\u6a21\u578b\u91cf\u5316\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4e3a\u57fa\u4e8e\u6444\u50cf\u5934\u7684\u591a\u89c6\u56fe3D\u68c0\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u91cf\u5316\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Here we extend the Feynman-Kac (FK) steering framework, an inference-time control approach, to diffusion-based protein design. By coupling FK steering with structure generation, the method guides sampling toward desirable structural or energetic features while maintaining the diversity of the underlying diffusion process. To enable simultaneous generation of both sequence and structure properties, rewards are computed on models refined through ProteinMPNN and all-atom relaxation. Applied to binder design, FK steering consistently improves predicted interface energetics across diverse targets with minimal computational overhead. More broadly, this work demonstrates that inference-time FK control generalizes diffusion-based protein design to arbitrary, non-differentiable, and reward-agnostic objectives, providing a unified and model-independent framework for guided molecular generation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u6269\u5c55\u4e86Feynman-Kac (FK) \u5f15\u5bfc\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u5176\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u7684\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u63a7\u5236\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5f15\u5bfc\u91c7\u6837\u671d\u5411\u7279\u5b9a\u529f\u80fd\u6216\u751f\u5316\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6269\u6563\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u7684\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u7ed3\u6784\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u7136\u80fd\u4ea7\u751f\u771f\u5b9e\u591a\u6837\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u4f46\u96be\u4ee5\u63a7\u5236\u751f\u6210\u7ed3\u679c\u671d\u5411\u7279\u5b9a\u529f\u80fd\u76ee\u6807\uff08\u5982\u7ed3\u5408\u4eb2\u548c\u529b\u6216\u5e8f\u5217\u7ec4\u6210\uff09\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u5f15\u5bfc\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u5c06FK\u5f15\u5bfc\u6846\u67b6\u4e0e\u7ed3\u6784\u751f\u6210\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u8ba1\u7b97\u5956\u52b1\u6765\u5f15\u5bfc\u91c7\u6837\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u540c\u65f6\u751f\u6210\u5e8f\u5217\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u5956\u52b1\u8ba1\u7b97\u57fa\u4e8eProteinMPNN\u548c\u5168\u539f\u5b50\u677e\u5f1b\u7cbe\u70bc\u540e\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u7ed3\u5408\u5242\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e2d\uff0cFK\u5f15\u5bfc\u4e00\u81f4\u6539\u5584\u4e86\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u754c\u9762\u80fd\u91cf\u5b66\uff0c\u5bf9\u591a\u79cd\u76ee\u6807\u90fd\u6709\u6548\uff0c\u4e14\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u6700\u5c0f\u3002", "conclusion": "FK\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u63a7\u5236\u5c06\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u7684\u86cb\u767d\u8d28\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63a8\u5e7f\u5230\u4efb\u610f\u3001\u4e0d\u53ef\u5fae\u5206\u548c\u5956\u52b1\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u4e3a\u5f15\u5bfc\u5206\u5b50\u751f\u6210\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u4e14\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

However, efficiently capturing high-fidelity reconstructions of specific objects within complex scenes remains a significant challenge. A key limitation of existing active reconstruction methods is their reliance on scene-level uncertainty metrics, which are often biased by irrelevant background clutter and lead to inefficient view selection for object-centric tasks. We present OUGS, a novel framework that addresses this challenge with a more principled, physically-grounded uncertainty formulation for 3DGS. Our core innovation is to derive uncertainty directly from the explicit physical parameters of the 3D Gaussian primitives (e.g., position, scale, rotation). By propagating the covariance of these parameters through the rendering Jacobian, we establish a highly interpretable uncertainty model. This foundation allows us to then seamlessly integrate semantic segmentation masks to produce a targeted, object-aware uncertainty score that effectively disentangles the object from its environment. This allows for a more effective active view selection strategy that prioritizes views critical to improving object fidelity. Experimental evaluations on public datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly improves the efficiency of the 3DGS reconstruction process and achieves higher quality for targeted objects compared to existing state-of-the-art methods, while also serving as a robust uncertainty estimator for the global scene.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86OUGS\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u57fa\u4e8e3D\u9ad8\u65af\u539f\u8bed\u7269\u7406\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u7269\u7406\u57fa\u7840\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5272\u5b9e\u73b0\u76ee\u6807\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u4e3b\u52a8\u91cd\u5efa\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e863D\u9ad8\u65af\u6cfc\u6e85\u5728\u590d\u6742\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7279\u5b9a\u5bf9\u8c61\u91cd\u5efa\u7684\u6548\u7387\u548c\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u4e3b\u52a8\u91cd\u5efa\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u573a\u666f\u7ea7\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5ea6\u91cf\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5ea6\u91cf\u5e38\u56e0\u65e0\u5173\u80cc\u666f\u5e72\u6270\u800c\u4ea7\u751f\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5728\u5bf9\u8c61\u4e2d\u5fc3\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u89c6\u56fe\u9009\u62e9\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u539f\u5219\u6027\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u4e13\u95e8\u63d0\u5347\u590d\u6742\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7279\u5b9a\u5bf9\u8c61\u7684\u91cd\u5efa\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "method": "\u4ece3D\u9ad8\u65af\u539f\u8bed\u7684\u663e\u5f0f\u7269\u7406\u53c2\u6570\uff08\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3001\u5c3a\u5ea6\u3001\u65cb\u8f6c\uff09\u76f4\u63a5\u63a8\u5bfc\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6e32\u67d3\u96c5\u53ef\u6bd4\u77e9\u9635\u4f20\u64ad\u53c2\u6570\u534f\u65b9\u5dee\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u9ad8\u5ea6\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u7136\u540e\u65e0\u7f1d\u96c6\u6210\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5272\u63a9\u7801\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u7684\u5bf9\u8c61\u611f\u77e5\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5206\u6570\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u5c06\u5bf9\u8c61\u4e0e\u73af\u5883\u89e3\u8026\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u516c\u5171\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc4\u4f30\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e863DGS\u91cd\u5efa\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u5bf9\u76ee\u6807\u5bf9\u8c61\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u91cd\u5efa\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5168\u5c40\u573a\u666f\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u3002", "conclusion": "OUGS\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u7269\u7406\u57fa\u7840\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u5bf9\u8c61\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u89c6\u56fe\u9009\u62e9\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4e3a3D\u9ad8\u65af\u6cfc\u6e85\u5728\u590d\u6742\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u7279\u5b9a\u5bf9\u8c61\u91cd\u5efa\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Existing vision-based methods often fail to generalize across domains and patients, leading to residual alignment errors. This work establishes a generalizable foundation for bronchoscopy navigation through a robust vision-based framework and a new synthetic benchmark dataset that enables standardized and reproducible evaluation. We propose a vision-based pose optimization framework for frame-wise 2D-3D registration between intra-operative endoscopic views and pre-operative CT anatomy. A fine-tuned modality- and domain-invariant encoder enables direct similarity computation between real endoscopic RGB frames and CT-rendered depth maps, while a differentiable rendering module iteratively refines camera poses through depth consistency. To enhance reproducibility, we introduce the first public synthetic benchmark dataset for bronchoscopy navigation, addressing the lack of paired CT-endoscopy data. Trained exclusively on synthetic data distinct from the benchmark, our model achieves an average translational error of 2.65 mm and a rotational error of 0.19 rad, demonstrating accurate and stable localization. Qualitative results on real patient data further confirm strong cross-domain generalization, achieving consistent frame-wise 2D-3D alignment without domain-specific adaptation. Overall, the proposed framework achieves robust, domain-invariant localization through iterative vision-based optimization, while the new benchmark provides a foundation for standardized progress in vision-based bronchoscopy navigation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c6\u89c9\u7684\u652f\u6c14\u7ba1\u955c\u5bfc\u822a\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc72D-3D\u914d\u51c6\u5b9e\u73b0\u672f\u4e2d\u5185\u7aa5\u955c\u89c6\u56fe\u4e0e\u672f\u524dCT\u89e3\u5256\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u5b9a\u4f4d\uff0c\u5e76\u521b\u5efa\u4e86\u9996\u4e2a\u516c\u5f00\u7684\u5408\u6210\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7528\u4e8e\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u652f\u6c14\u7ba1\u955c\u672f\u4e2d\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u547c\u5438\u8fd0\u52a8\u3001\u89e3\u5256\u53d8\u5f02\u548cCT\u5230\u8eab\u4f53\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u53d8\u5f62\u548c\u9519\u4f4d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u89c6\u89c9\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8de8\u57df\u548c\u8de8\u60a3\u8005\u6cdb\u5316\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u6a21\u6001\u548c\u57df\u4e0d\u53d8\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u76f4\u63a5\u8ba1\u7b97\u771f\u5b9e\u5185\u7aa5\u955cRGB\u5e27\u4e0eCT\u6e32\u67d3\u6df1\u5ea6\u56fe\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53ef\u5fae\u5206\u6e32\u67d3\u6a21\u5757\u8fed\u4ee3\u4f18\u5316\u76f8\u673a\u4f4d\u59ff\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u6df1\u5ea6\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u914d\u51c6\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5408\u6210\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u8fbe\u5230\u5e73\u5747\u5e73\u79fb\u8bef\u5dee2.65\u6beb\u7c73\u548c\u65cb\u8f6c\u8bef\u5dee0.19\u5f27\u5ea6\uff0c\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u60a3\u8005\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u8de8\u57df\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u8fed\u4ee3\u89c6\u89c9\u4f18\u5316\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9c81\u68d2\u3001\u57df\u4e0d\u53d8\u7684\u5b9a\u4f4d\uff0c\u65b0\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e3a\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c6\u89c9\u7684\u652f\u6c14\u7ba1\u955c\u5bfc\u822a\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u8fdb\u5c55\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

While extensive studies have examined attacks targeting either objective, strategies that simultaneously degrade both utility and fairness remain largely unexplored. To bridge this gap, we introduce the Dual-Facet Attack (DFA), a novel threat model that concurrently undermines predictive accuracy and group fairness. Two variants, Synchronous DFA (S-DFA) and Split DFA (Sp-DFA), are further proposed to capture distinct real-world collusion scenarios. Experimental results show that existing robust FL defenses, including hybrid aggregation schemes, fail to resist DFAs effectively. To counter these threats, we propose GuardFed, a self-adaptive defense framework that maintains a fairness-aware reference model using a small amount of clean server data augmented with synthetic samples. In each training round, GuardFed computes a dual-perspective trust score for every client by jointly evaluating its utility deviation and fairness degradation, thereby enabling selective aggregation of trustworthy updates.

Current MOT methods are often evaluated using publicly available datasets. However, most of these focus on everyday scenarios such as pedestrian tracking or are tailored to specific sports, including soccer and basketball. Despite the inherent challenges of tracking players in American football, such as frequent occlusion and physical contact, no standardized dataset has been publicly available, making fair comparisons between methods difficult. To address this gap, we constructed the first dedicated detection and tracking dataset for the American football players and conducted a comparative evaluation of various detection and tracking methods. Our results demonstrate that accurate detection and tracking can be achieved even in crowded scenarios. Fine-tuning detection models improved performance over pre-trained models. Furthermore, when these fine-tuned detectors and re-identification models were integrated into tracking systems, we observed notable improvements in tracking accuracy compared to existing approaches.

Lightweight CNNs are more efficient but suffer from accuracy gaps. Cross-Architecture Knowledge Distillation (CAKD) addresses this by transferring knowledge from ViTs to CNNs, yet existing methods often struggle with architectural mismatch and overlook the value of stronger homogeneous CNN teachers. To tackle these challenges, we propose a Dual-Teacher Knowledge Distillation framework that leverages both a heterogeneous ViT teacher and a homogeneous CNN teacher to collaboratively guide a lightweight CNN student. We introduce two key components: (1) Discrepancy-Aware Teacher Weighting, which dynamically fuses the predictions from ViT and CNN teachers by assigning adaptive weights based on teacher confidence and prediction discrepancy with the student, enabling more informative and effective supervision; and (2) a Structure Discrepancy-Aware Distillation strategy, where the student learns the residual features between ViT and CNN teachers via a lightweight auxiliary branch, focusing on transferable architectural differences without mimicking all of ViT's high-dimensional patterns. Extensive experiments on benchmarks including HMDB51, EPIC-KITCHENS-100, and Kinetics-400 demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art distillation approaches, achieving notable performance improvements with a maximum accuracy gain of 5.95% on HMDB51.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u53cc\u6559\u5e08\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u5f02\u6784ViT\u6559\u5e08\u548c\u540c\u6784CNN\u6559\u5e08\u534f\u540c\u6307\u5bfc\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7CNN\u5b66\u751f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5dee\u5f02\u611f\u77e5\u6559\u5e08\u52a0\u6743\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u5dee\u5f02\u611f\u77e5\u84b8\u998f\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u89c6\u9891\u52a8\u4f5c\u8bc6\u522b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "Vision Transformers\u5728\u89c6\u9891\u52a8\u4f5c\u8bc6\u522b\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u4f46\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff0c\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7CNNs\u6548\u7387\u9ad8\u4f46\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u8de8\u67b6\u6784\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u67b6\u6784\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e14\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u66f4\u5f3a\u540c\u6784CNN\u6559\u5e08\u7684\u4ef7\u503c\u3002", "method": "\u53cc\u6559\u5e08\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u5dee\u5f02\u611f\u77e5\u6559\u5e08\u52a0\u6743\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u6559\u5e08\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u548c\u4e0e\u5b66\u751f\u9884\u6d4b\u5dee\u5f02\u52a8\u6001\u878d\u5408ViT\u548cCNN\u6559\u5e08\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\uff1b2\uff09\u7ed3\u6784\u5dee\u5f02\u611f\u77e5\u84b8\u998f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u8f85\u52a9\u5206\u652f\u5b66\u4e60ViT\u548cCNN\u6559\u5e08\u95f4\u7684\u6b8b\u5dee\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u4e13\u6ce8\u4e8e\u53ef\u8f6c\u79fb\u7684\u67b6\u6784\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "result": "\u5728HMDB51\u3001EPIC-KITCHENS-100\u548cKinetics-400\u7b49\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6301\u7eed\u4f18\u4e8e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u84b8\u998f\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728HMDB51\u4e0a\u6700\u9ad8\u83b7\u5f975.95%\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u53cc\u6559\u5e08\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u67b6\u6784\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u534f\u540c\u5229\u7528\u5f02\u6784\u548c\u540c\u6784\u6559\u5e08\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7CNN\u5728\u89c6\u9891\u52a8\u4f5c\u8bc6\u522b\u4e2d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

However, most existing methods rely solely on geometric cues and predict each 3D pose independently, which limits their ability to resolve ambiguous motions and generalize to real-world scenarios. Inspired by how humans understand and anticipate motion, we introduce DreamPose3D, a diffusion-based framework that combines action-aware reasoning with temporal imagination for 3D pose estimation. DreamPose3D dynamically conditions the denoising process using task-relevant action prompts extracted from 2D pose sequences, capturing high-level intent. To model the structural relationships between joints effectively, we introduce a representation encoder that incorporates kinematic joint affinity into the attention mechanism. Finally, a hallucinative pose decoder predicts temporally coherent 3D pose sequences during training, simulating how humans mentally reconstruct motion trajectories to resolve ambiguity in perception. Extensive experiments on benchmarked Human3.6M and MPI-3DHP datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance across all metrics. To further validate DreamPose3D's robustness, we tested it on a broadcast baseball dataset, where it demonstrated strong performance despite ambiguous and noisy 2D inputs, effectively handling temporal consistency and intent-driven motion variations.", "AI": {"tldr": "DreamPose3D\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u76843D\u4eba\u4f53\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u52a8\u4f5c\u611f\u77e5\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u60f3\u8c61\u529b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u4f5c\u63d0\u793a\u3001\u5173\u8282\u5173\u7cfb\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u5e7b\u89c9\u59ff\u6001\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u76843D\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u67093D\u4eba\u4f53\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u51e0\u4f55\u7ebf\u7d22\u5e76\u72ec\u7acb\u9884\u6d4b\u6bcf\u5e27\u59ff\u6001\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd0\u52a8\u6a21\u7cca\u95ee\u9898\u5e76\u6cdb\u5316\u5230\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u3002\u53d7\u4eba\u7c7b\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u9884\u6d4b\u8fd0\u52a8\u65b9\u5f0f\u7684\u542f\u53d1\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7ed3\u5408\u9ad8\u7ea7\u610f\u56fe\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u5efa\u6a21\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDreamPose3D\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u4f7f\u7528\u4ece2D\u59ff\u6001\u5e8f\u5217\u63d0\u53d6\u7684\u52a8\u4f5c\u63d0\u793a\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u8282\u53bb\u566a\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff1b2\uff09\u5f15\u5165\u5305\u542b\u8fd0\u52a8\u5b66\u5173\u8282\u4eb2\u548c\u529b\u7684\u8868\u793a\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff1b3\uff09\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u4f7f\u7528\u5e7b\u89c9\u59ff\u6001\u89e3\u7801\u5668\u9884\u6d4b\u65f6\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u76843D\u59ff\u6001\u5e8f\u5217\u3002", "result": "\u5728Human3.6M\u548cMPI-3DHP\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5728\u5e7f\u64ad\u68d2\u7403\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5c3d\u7ba1\u8f93\u5165\u6a21\u7cca\u548c\u5608\u6742\uff0c\u4ecd\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u610f\u56fe\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u8fd0\u52a8\u53d8\u5316\u3002", "conclusion": "DreamPose3D\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u52a8\u4f5c\u611f\u77e5\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u5173\u8282\u5173\u7cfb\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u60f3\u8c61\u529b\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e863D\u4eba\u4f53\u59ff\u6001\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5904\u7406\u6a21\u7cca\u8fd0\u52a8\u548c\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002"}}

In MARBLE, each arm evolves according to a latent environment state that switches over time, making policy learning substantially more challenging. We further introduce the Markov-Averaged Indexability (MAI) criterion as a relaxed indexability assumption and prove that, despite unobserved regime switches, under the MAI criterion, synchronous Q-learning with Whittle Indices (QWI) converges almost surely to the optimal Q-function and the corresponding Whittle indices.

This document is the extended version which includes the appendix", "summary": "The proliferation of complex, black-box AI models has intensified the need for techniques that can explain their decisions. Feature attribution methods have become a popular solution for providing post-hoc explanations, yet the field has historically lacked a formal problem definition. This paper addresses this gap by introducing a formal definition for the problem of feature attribution, which stipulates that explanations be supported by an underlying probability distribution represented by the given dataset. Our analysis reveals that many existing model-agnostic methods fail to meet this criterion, while even those that do often possess other limitations.

While existing attacks primarily rely on data poisoning, they require large-scale user access or fake profiles thus lacking practicality. In this paper, we focus on the Profile Pollution Attack that subtly contaminates partial user interactions to induce targeted mispredictions. Previous PPA methods suffer from two limitations, i.e., i) over-reliance on sequence horizon impact restricts fine-grained perturbations on item transitions, and ii) holistic modifications cause detectable distribution shifts. To address these challenges, we propose a constrained reinforcement driven attack CREAT that synergizes a bi-level optimization framework with multi-reward reinforcement learning to balance adversarial efficacy and stealthiness. We first develop a Pattern Balanced Rewarding Policy, which integrates pattern inversion rewards to invert critical patterns and distribution consistency rewards to minimize detectable shifts via unbalanced co-optimal transport. Then we employ a Constrained Group Relative Reinforcement Learning paradigm, enabling step-wise perturbations through dynamic barrier constraints and group-shared experience replay, achieving targeted pollution with minimal detectability.

Recently, stringent privacy regulations such as GDPR and CCPA have introduced significant new challenges for existing spatio-temporal graph models, requiring complete unlearning of unauthorized data. Since each node in a spatio-temporal graph diffuses information globally across both spatial and temporal dimensions, existing unlearning methods primarily designed for static graphs and localized data removal cannot efficiently erase a single node without incurring costs nearly equivalent to full model retraining. Therefore, an effective approach for complete spatio-temporal graph unlearning is a pressing need. To address this, we propose CallosumNet, a divide-and-conquer spatio-temporal graph unlearning framework inspired by the corpus callosum structure that facilitates communication between the brain's two hemispheres. CallosumNet incorporates two novel techniques: (1) Enhanced Subgraph Construction (ESC), which adaptively constructs multiple localized subgraphs based on several factors, including biologically-inspired virtual ganglions; and (2) Global Ganglion Bridging (GGB), which reconstructs global spatio-temporal dependencies from these localized subgraphs, effectively restoring the full graph representation. Empirical results on four diverse real-world datasets show that CallosumNet achieves complete unlearning with only 1%-2% relative MAE loss compared to the gold model, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art baselines.

It is widely used in finance, advertising, medicine, and other domains. Two main approaches to SHAP calculation exist: Path-Dependent SHAP, which leverages the tree structure for efficiency, and Background SHAP, which uses a background dataset to estimate feature distributions.\n  We introduce WOODELF, a SHAP algorithm that integrates decision trees, game theory, and Boolean logic into a unified framework. For each consumer, WOODELF constructs a pseudo-Boolean formula that captures their feature values, the structure of the decision tree ensemble, and the entire background dataset. It then leverages this representation to compute Background SHAP in linear time. WOODELF can also compute Path-Dependent SHAP, Shapley interaction values, Banzhaf values, and Banzhaf interaction values.\n  WOODELF is designed to run efficiently on CPU and GPU hardware alike. Available via the WOODELF Python package, it is implemented using NumPy, SciPy, and CuPy without relying on custom C++ or CUDA code. This design enables fast performance and seamless integration into existing frameworks, supporting large-scale computation of SHAP and other game-theoretic values in practice.\n  For example, on a dataset with 3,000,000 rows, 5,000,000 background samples, and 127 features, WOODELF computed all Background Shapley values in 162 seconds on CPU and 16 seconds on GPU - compared to 44 minutes required by the best method on any hardware platform, representing 16x and 165x speedups, respectively.", "AI": {"tldr": "WOODELF\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684SHAP\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u51b3\u7b56\u6811\u3001\u535a\u5f08\u8bba\u548c\u5e03\u5c14\u903b\u8f91\u6574\u5408\u5230\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u7ebf\u6027\u65f6\u95f4\u5185\u8ba1\u7b97\u80cc\u666fSHAP\u503c\uff0c\u5728CPU\u548cGPU\u4e0a\u90fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u7684\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684SHAP\u8ba1\u7b97\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5904\u7406\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u65f6\u6548\u7387\u8f83\u4f4e\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u6765\u652f\u6301\u91d1\u878d\u3001\u5e7f\u544a\u3001\u533b\u7597\u7b49\u9886\u57df\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "WOODELF\u4e3a\u6bcf\u4e2a\u6d88\u8d39\u8005\u6784\u5efa\u4f2a\u5e03\u5c14\u516c\u5f0f\uff0c\u6355\u6349\u7279\u5f81\u503c\u3001\u51b3\u7b56\u6811\u96c6\u6210\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u6574\u4e2a\u80cc\u666f\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u5229\u7528\u8fd9\u79cd\u8868\u793a\u5728\u7ebf\u6027\u65f6\u95f4\u5185\u8ba1\u7b97\u80cc\u666fSHAP\u503c\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5305\u542b300\u4e07\u884c\u3001500\u4e07\u80cc\u666f\u6837\u672c\u548c127\u4e2a\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cWOODELF\u5728CPU\u4e0a\u8ba1\u7b97\u6240\u6709\u80cc\u666fShapley\u503c\u4ec5\u9700162\u79d2\uff0c\u5728GPU\u4e0a\u4ec5\u970016\u79d2\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u4f73\u65b9\u6cd5\u5206\u522b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e8616\u500d\u548c165\u500d\u7684\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "WOODELF\u901a\u8fc7\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86SHAP\u8ba1\u7b97\u7684\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6e38\u620f\u7406\u8bba\u503c\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u591f\u65e0\u7f1d\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u73b0\u6709\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\u3002"}}

As planning shifts from demand-based to supply-oriented strategies, Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) have become essential for managing traffic within existing infrastructure. A core ITS function is traffic forecasting, enabling proactive measures like ramp metering, signal control, and dynamic routing through platforms such as Google Maps. This study assesses the performance of statistical, machine learning (ML), and deep learning (DL) models in forecasting traffic speed and flow using real-world data from California's Harbor Freeway, sourced from the Caltrans Performance Measurement System (PeMS). Each model was evaluated over 20 forecasting windows (up to 1 hour 40 minutes) using RMSE, MAE, and R-Square metrics. Results show ANFIS-GP performs best at early windows with RMSE of 0.038, MAE of 0.0276, and R-Square of 0.9983, while Bi-LSTM is more robust for medium-term prediction due to its capacity to model long-range temporal dependencies, achieving RMSE of 0.1863, MAE of 0.0833, and R-Square of 0.987 at a forecasting of 20. The degradation in model performance was quantified using logarithmic transformation, with slope values used to measure robustness. Among DL models, Bi-LSTM had the flattest slope (0.0454 RMSE, 0.0545 MAE for flow), whereas ANFIS-GP had 0.1058 for RMSE and 0.1037 for flow MAE.

In contrast, certifying models against training data perturbations remains a relatively under-explored area. These perturbations can arise in three critical contexts: adversarial data poisoning, where an adversary manipulates training samples to corrupt model performance; machine unlearning, which requires certifying model behavior under the removal of specific training data; and differential privacy, where guarantees must be given with respect to substituting individual data points. This work introduces Abstract Gradient Training (AGT), a unified framework for certifying robustness of a given model and training procedure to training data perturbations, including bounded perturbations, the removal of data points, and the addition of new samples. By bounding the reachable set of parameters, i.e., establishing provable parameter-space bounds, AGT provides a formal approach to analyzing the behavior of models trained via first-order optimization methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Abstract Gradient Training (AGT)\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8ba4\u8bc1\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u6270\u52a8\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u6709\u754c\u6270\u52a8\u3001\u6570\u636e\u70b9\u79fb\u9664\u548c\u65b0\u6837\u672c\u6dfb\u52a0\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u6570\u636e\u6270\u52a8\u7684\u8ba4\u8bc1\uff0c\u800c\u5bf9\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u6270\u52a8\u7684\u8ba4\u8bc1\u7814\u7a76\u76f8\u5bf9\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u6270\u52a8\u53ef\u80fd\u51fa\u73b0\u5728\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u6570\u636e\u6295\u6bd2\u3001\u673a\u5668\u53bb\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u7b49\u5173\u952e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u9650\u5236\u53ef\u8fbe\u53c2\u6570\u96c6\uff0c\u5373\u5efa\u7acb\u53ef\u8bc1\u660e\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u7a7a\u95f4\u8fb9\u754c\uff0cAGT\u4e3a\u5206\u6790\u901a\u8fc7\u4e00\u9636\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u884c\u4e3a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "AGT\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u8ba4\u8bc1\u7ed9\u5b9a\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5bf9\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u6270\u52a8\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "AGT\u6846\u67b6\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u6270\u52a8\u8ba4\u8bc1\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u4e3a\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u6570\u636e\u6295\u6bd2\u3001\u673a\u5668\u53bb\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u7b49\u573a\u666f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u8ba4\u8bc1\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

However, existing methods suffer from Gradient Starvation and Policy Degradation when training directly on samples with mixed difficulty. To mitigate this, prior approaches leverage Chain-of-Thought (CoT) data, but the construction of high-quality CoT annotations remains labor-intensive. Alternatively, curriculum learning strategies have been explored but frequently encounter challenges, such as difficulty mismatch, reliance on manual curriculum design, and catastrophic forgetting. To address these issues, we propose AdaCuRL, a Adaptive Curriculum Reinforcement Learning framework that integrates coarse-to-fine difficulty estimation with adaptive curriculum scheduling. This approach dynamically aligns data difficulty with model capability and incorporates a data revisitation mechanism to mitigate catastrophic forgetting. Furthermore, AdaCuRL employs adaptive reference and sparse KL strategies to prevent Policy Degradation.

However, existing methods typically rely on retain data to constrain model behavior, which increases computational and energy burdens and conflicts with industrial data silos and privacy compliance requirements. To address this, we propose a novel retain-free unlearning framework, referred to as Probing then Editing (PTE). PTE frames unlearning as a probe-edit process: first, it probes the decision boundary neighborhood of the model on the to-be-forgotten class via gradient ascent and generates corresponding editing instructions using the model's own predictions. Subsequently, a push-pull collaborative optimization is performed: the push branch actively dismantles the decision region of the target class using the editing instructions, while the pull branch applies masked knowledge distillation to anchor the model's knowledge on retained classes to their original states. Benefiting from this mechanism, PTE achieves efficient and balanced knowledge editing using only the to-be-forgotten data and the original model. Experimental results demonstrate that PTE achieves an excellent balance between unlearning effectiveness and model utility across multiple general and industrial benchmarks such as CWRU and SCUT-FD.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aPTE\u7684\u514d\u4fdd\u7559\u9057\u5fd8\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u63a2\u6d4b-\u7f16\u8f91\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\uff0c\u4ec5\u9700\u9057\u5fd8\u6570\u636e\u548c\u539f\u59cb\u6a21\u578b\u5373\u53ef\u9ad8\u6548\u7f16\u8f91\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u52a8\u6001\u5de5\u4e1a\u7269\u8054\u7f51\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u6a21\u578b\u9700\u8981\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u8fc7\u65f6\u6216\u9519\u8bef\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u4fdd\u7559\u6570\u636e\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d1f\u62c5\u548c\u9690\u79c1\u5408\u89c4\u51b2\u7a81\u3002", "method": "PTE\u6846\u67b6\u5305\u542b\u63a2\u6d4b-\u7f16\u8f91\u4e24\u4e2a\u9636\u6bb5\uff1a\u9996\u5148\u901a\u8fc7\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0a\u5347\u63a2\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5f85\u9057\u5fd8\u7c7b\u522b\u51b3\u7b56\u8fb9\u754c\u90bb\u57df\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u7f16\u8f91\u6307\u4ee4\uff1b\u7136\u540e\u8fdb\u884c\u63a8-\u62c9\u534f\u540c\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u63a8\u5206\u652f\u4e3b\u52a8\u62c6\u89e3\u76ee\u6807\u7c7b\u522b\u51b3\u7b56\u533a\u57df\uff0c\u62c9\u5206\u652f\u5e94\u7528\u63a9\u7801\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u951a\u5b9a\u4fdd\u7559\u7c7b\u522b\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0cPTE\u5728CWRU\u548cSCUT-FD\u7b49\u591a\u4e2a\u901a\u7528\u548c\u5de5\u4e1a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u5728\u9057\u5fd8\u6548\u679c\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u6548\u7528\u4e4b\u95f4\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u826f\u597d\u5e73\u8861\u3002", "conclusion": "PTE\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u5f85\u9057\u5fd8\u6570\u636e\u548c\u539f\u59cb\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u5e73\u8861\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u7f16\u8f91\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5de5\u4e1a\u7269\u8054\u7f51\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u6a21\u578b\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002"}}

We find that a single transformer model trained on millions of programs is able to generalize across symbolic regression problems of varying dimension. Evaluated on 24 real-world and synthetic datasets, TSGP significantly outperforms standard GP, SLIM_GSGP, Deep Symbolic Regression, and Denoising Autoencoder GP, achieving an average rank of 1.58 across all benchmarks. Moreover, TSGP produces more compact solutions than SLIM_GSGP, despite its higher accuracy. In addition, the target semantic distance $\\mathrm{SD}_t$ is able to control the step size in the semantic space: small values of $\\mathrm{SD}_t$ enable consistent improvement in fitness but often lead to larger programs, while larger values promote faster convergence and compactness.

However, most existing data-driven methods used for SEP predictions are operated as black-box models, making it challenging for solar physicists to interpret the results and understand the underlying physical causes of such events rather than just obtain a prediction. To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework that integrates global explanations and ad-hoc feature mapping to enhance model transparency and provide deeper insights into the decision-making process. We validate our approach using a dataset of 341 SEP events, including 244 significant (>=10 MeV) proton events exceeding the Space Weather Prediction Center S1 threshold, spanning solar cycles 22, 23, and 24. Furthermore, we present an explainability-focused case study of major SEP events, demonstrating how our method improves explainability and facilitates a more physics-informed understanding of SEP event prediction.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u96c6\u6210\u5168\u5c40\u89e3\u91ca\u548c\u7279\u8bbe\u7279\u5f81\u6620\u5c04\u7684\u65b0\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u592a\u9633\u9ad8\u80fd\u7c92\u5b50\u4e8b\u4ef6\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e2e\u52a9\u7406\u89e3\u9884\u6d4b\u80cc\u540e\u7684\u7269\u7406\u539f\u56e0\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u592a\u9633\u9ad8\u80fd\u7c92\u5b50\u4e8b\u4ef6\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u591a\u4e3a\u9ed1\u76d2\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u89e3\u91ca\u7ed3\u679c\u548c\u4e86\u89e3\u4e8b\u4ef6\u80cc\u540e\u7684\u7269\u7406\u539f\u56e0\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u63d0\u9ad8\u6a21\u578b\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\u548c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7ed3\u5408\u5168\u5c40\u89e3\u91ca\u548c\u7279\u8bbe\u7279\u5f81\u6620\u5c04\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528341\u4e2aSEP\u4e8b\u4ef6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8fdb\u884c\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u5305\u62ec244\u4e2a\u91cd\u8981\u8d28\u5b50\u4e8b\u4ef6\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4e3b\u8981SEP\u4e8b\u4ef6\u7684\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u7269\u7406\u7684SEP\u4e8b\u4ef6\u9884\u6d4b\u7406\u89e3\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u6210\u529f\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86SEP\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u900f\u660e\u5ea6\uff0c\u4e3a\u592a\u9633\u7269\u7406\u5b66\u5bb6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u6df1\u5165\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\u6d1e\u5bdf\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u7406\u89e3\u592a\u9633\u9ad8\u80fd\u7c92\u5b50\u4e8b\u4ef6\u7684\u7269\u7406\u673a\u5236\u3002"}}

Rather than training policies or value heads, we investigate whether planning can be carried out directly in an evaluation-aligned embedding space. We introduce SOLIS, which learns such a space using supervised contrastive learning. In this representation, outcome similarity is captured by proximity, and a single global advantage vector orients the space from losing to winning regions. Candidate actions are then ranked according to their alignment with this direction, reducing planning to vector operations in latent space. We demonstrate this approach in chess, where SOLIS uses only a shallow search guided by the learned embedding to reach competitive strength under constrained conditions.

Current Rehearsal-based CL methods typically construct the memory buffer by selecting a representative subset (referred to as coresets), aiming to approximate the training efficacy of the full dataset with minimal storage overhead. However, mainstream Coreset Selection (CS) methods generally formulate the CS problem as a bi-level optimization problem that relies on numerous inner and outer iterations to solve, leading to substantial computational cost thus limiting their practical efficiency. In this paper, we aim to provide a more efficient selection logic and scheme for coreset construction. To this end, we first analyze the Mean Squared Error (MSE) between the buffer-trained model and the Bayes-optimal model through the perspective of localized error decomposition to investigate the contribution of samples from different regions to MSE suppression. Further theoretical and experimental analyses demonstrate that samples with high probability density play a dominant role in error suppression. Inspired by this, we propose the Probability Density-Aware Coreset (PDAC) method. PDAC leverages the Projected Gaussian Mixture (PGM) model to estimate each sample's joint density, enabling efficient density-prioritized buffer selection. Finally, we introduce the streaming Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm to enhance the adaptability of PGM parameters to streaming data, yielding Streaming PDAC (SPDAC) for streaming scenarios.

Synthetic data generation offers scalability, but its effectiveness relies on complex, multi-stage workflows, integrating prompt engineering and model orchestration. Existing automated workflow methods face a cold start problem: they require labeled datasets for reward modeling, which is especially problematic for subjective, open-ended tasks with no objective ground truth. We introduce AutoSynth, a framework that automates workflow discovery and optimization without reference datasets by reframing the problem as a Monte Carlo Tree Search guided by a novel dataset-free hybrid reward. This reward enables meta-learning through two LLM-as-judge components: one evaluates sample quality using dynamically generated task-specific metrics, and another assesses workflow code and prompt quality. Experiments on subjective educational tasks show that while expert-designed workflows achieve higher human preference rates (96-99% win rates vs. AutoSynth's 40-51%), models trained on AutoSynth-generated data dramatically outperform baselines (40-51% vs. 2-5%) and match or surpass expert workflows on certain metrics, suggesting discovery of quality dimensions beyond human intuition.

A least-squares temporal difference learning scheme is then developed to estimate the quadratic critic parameters efficiently.

The task is complicated by the large modality gap between sequences and phenotypes, as well as the pleiotropic nature of gene-phenotype relationships. Existing sequence-based efforts focus on the degree to which variants of specific genes alter a limited set of phenotypes, while general gene knockout induced phenotype abnormality prediction methods heavily rely on curated genetic information as inputs, which limits scalability and generalizability. As a result, the task of broadly predicting the presence of multiple phenotype abnormalities under gene knockout directly from gene sequences remains underexplored. We introduce GenePheno, the first interpretable multi-label prediction framework that predicts knockout induced phenotypic abnormalities from gene sequences. GenePheno employs a contrastive multi-label learning objective that captures inter-phenotype correlations, complemented by an exclusive regularization that enforces biological consistency. It further incorporates a gene function bottleneck layer, offering human interpretable concepts that reflect functional mechanisms behind phenotype formation. To support progress in this area, we curate four datasets with canonical gene sequences as input and multi-label phenotypic abnormalities induced by gene knockouts as targets. Across these datasets, GenePheno achieves state-of-the-art gene-centric Fmax and phenotype-centric AUC, and case studies demonstrate its ability to reveal gene functional mechanisms.", "AI": {"tldr": "GenePheno\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u591a\u6807\u7b7e\u9884\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u76f4\u63a5\u4ece\u57fa\u56e0\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u57fa\u56e0\u6572\u9664\u8bf1\u5bfc\u7684\u8868\u578b\u5f02\u5e38\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u8be5\u9886\u57df\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u7279\u5b9a\u57fa\u56e0\u53d8\u5f02\u5bf9\u6709\u9650\u8868\u578b\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u6216\u4f9d\u8d56\u4eba\u5de5\u6574\u7406\u7684\u9057\u4f20\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u76f4\u63a5\u4ece\u57fa\u56e0\u5e8f\u5217\u5e7f\u6cdb\u9884\u6d4b\u57fa\u56e0\u6572\u9664\u8bf1\u5bfc\u7684\u591a\u8868\u578b\u5f02\u5e38\u4ecd\u672a\u88ab\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5bf9\u6bd4\u591a\u6807\u7b7e\u5b66\u4e60\u76ee\u6807\u6355\u83b7\u8868\u578b\u95f4\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6392\u4ed6\u6027\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u786e\u4fdd\u751f\u7269\u5b66\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u56e0\u529f\u80fd\u74f6\u9888\u5c42\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u529f\u80fd\u673a\u5236\u6982\u5ff5\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cGenePheno\u5728\u57fa\u56e0\u4e2d\u5fc3Fmax\u548c\u8868\u578b\u4e2d\u5fc3AUC\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6c34\u5e73\uff0c\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u63ed\u793a\u57fa\u56e0\u529f\u80fd\u673a\u5236\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "GenePheno\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u76f4\u63a5\u4ece\u57fa\u56e0\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u6572\u9664\u8bf1\u5bfc\u8868\u578b\u5f02\u5e38\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u591a\u6807\u7b7e\u9884\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4e3a\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u5047\u8bbe\u9a71\u52a8\u5b9e\u9a8c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

Thus, NSL-MT provides a data-efficient alternative training method for settings where there is limited annotated parallel corporas.", "AI": {"tldr": "NSL-MT\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u8bed\u8a00\u7ea6\u675f\u7f16\u7801\u4e3a\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u4e2d\u7684\u4e25\u91cd\u6027\u52a0\u6743\u60e9\u7f5a\u6765\u6559\u5bfc\u6a21\u578b\u4e0d\u751f\u6210\u4ec0\u4e48\u5185\u5bb9\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5408\u6210\u751f\u6210\u8fdd\u53cd\u76ee\u6807\u8bed\u8a00\u8bed\u6cd5\u7684\u6837\u672c\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u6709\u9650\u7684\u5e76\u884c\u6570\u636e\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5728\u6709\u9650\u6807\u6ce8\u5e73\u884c\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u673a\u5668\u7ffb\u8bd1\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6570\u636e\u6548\u7387\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u660e\u786e\u60e9\u7f5a\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u8bed\u8a00\u65e0\u6548\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u9ad8\u6982\u7387\u5206\u914d\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u8bed\u8a00\u7ea6\u675f\u7f16\u7801\u4e3a\u4e25\u91cd\u6027\u52a0\u6743\u7684\u60e9\u7f5a\u9879\u878d\u5165\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5408\u6210\u751f\u6210\u8fdd\u53cd\u76ee\u6807\u8bed\u8a00\u8bed\u6cd5\u7684\u6837\u672c\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u660e\u786e\u60e9\u7f5a\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u8bed\u8a00\u65e0\u6548\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u9ad8\u6982\u7387\u5206\u914d\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6240\u6709\u67b6\u6784\u4e0a\u90fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6539\u8fdb\uff1a\u6027\u80fd\u826f\u597d\u6a21\u578b\u83b7\u5f973-12% BLEU\u589e\u76ca\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8db3\u591f\u521d\u59cb\u652f\u6301\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u83b7\u5f9756-89%\u589e\u76ca\uff1b\u63d0\u4f9b5\u500d\u6570\u636e\u6548\u7387\u4e58\u6570\uff0c\u75281,000\u4e2a\u6837\u672c\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fbe\u5230\u6216\u8d85\u8fc7\u6b63\u5e385,000\u4e2a\u6837\u672c\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6548\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "NSL-MT\u4e3a\u6709\u9650\u6807\u6ce8\u5e73\u884c\u8bed\u6599\u5e93\u573a\u666f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6570\u636e\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u66ff\u4ee3\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}
