Abstract: Recently, a significant improvement in the accuracy of 3D human pose
estimation has been achieved by combining convolutional neural networks (CNNs)
with pyramid grid alignment feedback loops. Additionally, innovative
breakthroughs have been made in the field of computer vision through the
adoption of Transformer-based temporal analysis architectures. Given these
advancements, this study aims to deeply optimize and improve the existing Pymaf
network architecture. The main innovations of this paper include: (1)
Introducing a Transformer feature extraction network layer based on
self-attention mechanisms to enhance the capture of low-level features; (2)
Enhancing the understanding and capture of temporal signals in video sequences
through feature temporal fusion techniques; (3) Implementing spatial pyramid
structures to achieve multi-scale feature fusion, effectively balancing feature
representations differences across different scales. The new PyCAT4 model
obtained in this study is validated through experiments on the COCO and 3DPW
datasets. The results demonstrate that the proposed improvement strategies
significantly enhance the network's detection capability in human pose
estimation, further advancing the development of human pose estimation
technology.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖稀缺的配对数据集，难以在无约束场景中保持细节和时间一致性，因此需要一种更灵活、高效的解决方案。

Method: 第一阶段使用多帧试穿模型和视觉语言模型生成高质量关键帧图像；第二阶段结合骨架图和动态描述，通过增强的视频生成模型生成连贯视频。

Result: 实验表明，DreamVVT在细节保留和时间稳定性上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DreamVVT通过两阶段设计和预训练模型的有效利用，显著提升了视频虚拟试穿技术的性能。

Abstract: Video virtual try-on (VVT) technology has garnered considerable academic
interest owing to its promising applications in e-commerce advertising and
entertainment. However, most existing end-to-end methods rely heavily on scarce
paired garment-centric datasets and fail to effectively leverage priors of
advanced visual models and test-time inputs, making it challenging to
accurately preserve fine-grained garment details and maintain temporal
consistency in unconstrained scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose
DreamVVT, a carefully designed two-stage framework built upon Diffusion
Transformers (DiTs), which is inherently capable of leveraging diverse unpaired
human-centric data to enhance adaptability in real-world scenarios. To further
leverage prior knowledge from pretrained models and test-time inputs, in the
first stage, we sample representative frames from the input video and utilize a
multi-frame try-on model integrated with a vision-language model (VLM), to
synthesize high-fidelity and semantically consistent keyframe try-on images.
These images serve as complementary appearance guidance for subsequent video
generation. \textbf{In the second stage}, skeleton maps together with
fine-grained motion and appearance descriptions are extracted from the input
content, and these along with the keyframe try-on images are then fed into a
pretrained video generation model enhanced with LoRA adapters. This ensures
long-term temporal coherence for unseen regions and enables highly plausible
dynamic motions. Extensive quantitative and qualitative experiments demonstrate
that DreamVVT surpasses existing methods in preserving detailed garment content
and temporal stability in real-world scenarios. Our project page

### [3] [Elucidating the Role of Feature Normalization in IJEPA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02829)
*Adam Colton*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出在IJEPA架构中，用DynTanh激活替代层归一化（LN），以保留视觉标记的自然能量层级，提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 层归一化破坏了视觉标记的自然能量层级，导致语义重要区域无法被优先处理，且引入棋盘状伪影。

Method: 用DynTanh激活替代层归一化，保留高能量标记的贡献。

Result: 改进后模型在ImageNet线性探测准确率从38%提升至42.7%，NYU Depth V2深度估计的RMSE降低0.08。

Conclusion: 保留标记的自然能量层级对自监督视觉表示学习至关重要。

Abstract: In the standard image joint embedding predictive architecture (IJEPA),
features at the output of the teacher encoder are layer normalized (LN) before
serving as a distillation target for the student encoder and predictor. We
propose that this feature normalization disrupts the natural energy hierarchy
of visual tokens, where high-energy tokens (those with larger L2 norms) encode
semantically important image regions. LN forces all features to have identical
L2 norms, effectively equalizing their energies and preventing the model from
prioritizing semantically rich regions. We find that IJEPA models trained with
feature LN exhibit loss maps with significant checkerboard-like artifacts. We
propose that feature LN be replaced with a DynTanh activation as the latter
better preserves token energies and allows high-energy tokens to greater
contribute to the prediction loss. We show that IJEPA trained with feature
DynTanh exhibits a longer-tailed loss distribution and fixes the checkerboard
artifacts in the loss map. Our empirical results show that our simple
modification improves ImageNet linear probe accuracy from 38% to 42.7% for
ViT-Small and reduces RMSE by 0.08 on NYU Depth V2 monocular depth estimation.
These results suggest that preserving natural token energies is crucial for
effective self-supervised visual representation learning.

### [4] [GENIE: Gaussian Encoding for Neural Radiance Fields Interactive Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02831)
*Mikołaj Zieliński,Krzysztof Byrski,Tomasz Szczepanik,Przemysław Spurek*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GENIE结合了NeRF的高保真渲染和Gaussian Splatting的可编辑性，通过高斯特征嵌入和RT-GPS算法实现实时交互编辑。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: NeRF的隐式编码难以编辑，而GS的显式结构更适合交互和物理模拟。GENIE旨在结合两者的优势。

Method: GENIE使用高斯特征嵌入和RT-GPS算法，结合多分辨率哈希网格，实现高效的高斯邻近搜索和实时编辑。

Result: GENIE支持实时、局部感知的编辑，动态交互，并与物理模拟兼容。

Conclusion: GENIE通过混合隐式和显式表示，填补了几何编辑与神经渲染之间的鸿沟。

Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and Gaussian Splatting (GS) have recently
transformed 3D scene representation and rendering. NeRF achieves high-fidelity
novel view synthesis by learning volumetric representations through neural
networks, but its implicit encoding makes editing and physical interaction
challenging. In contrast, GS represents scenes as explicit collections of
Gaussian primitives, enabling real-time rendering, faster training, and more
intuitive manipulation. This explicit structure has made GS particularly
well-suited for interactive editing and integration with physics-based
simulation. In this paper, we introduce GENIE (Gaussian Encoding for Neural
Radiance Fields Interactive Editing), a hybrid model that combines the
photorealistic rendering quality of NeRF with the editable and structured
representation of GS. Instead of using spherical harmonics for appearance
modeling, we assign each Gaussian a trainable feature embedding. These
embeddings are used to condition a NeRF network based on the k nearest
Gaussians to each query point. To make this conditioning efficient, we
introduce Ray-Traced Gaussian Proximity Search (RT-GPS), a fast nearest
Gaussian search based on a modified ray-tracing pipeline. We also integrate a
multi-resolution hash grid to initialize and update Gaussian features.
Together, these components enable real-time, locality-aware editing: as
Gaussian primitives are repositioned or modified, their interpolated influence
is immediately reflected in the rendered output. By combining the strengths of
implicit and explicit representations, GENIE supports intuitive scene
manipulation, dynamic interaction, and compatibility with physical simulation,
bridging the gap between geometry-based editing and neural rendering. The code
can be found under (https://github.com/MikolajZielinski/genie)

### [5] [RefineSeg: Dual Coarse-to-Fine Learning for Medical Image Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02844)
*Anghong Du,Nay Aung,Theodoros N. Arvanitis,Stefan K. Piechnik,Joao A C Lima,Steffen E. Petersen,Le Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于粗标注的医学图像分割框架，通过引入转移矩阵建模噪声，逐步优化分割结果，性能接近全监督方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像的高质量像素级标注成本高且需要专业知识，粗标注虽易获取但存在噪声，需解决这一问题。

Method: 提出粗到细的分割框架，利用转移矩阵建模粗标注中的噪声，通过多组粗标注联合训练逐步优化网络输出。

Result: 在ACDC、MSCMRseg和UK Biobank数据集上验证，性能优于弱监督方法，接近全监督方法。

Conclusion: 该方法通过粗标注实现了高质量分割，为医学图像分析提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: High-quality pixel-level annotations of medical images are essential for
supervised segmentation tasks, but obtaining such annotations is costly and
requires medical expertise. To address this challenge, we propose a novel
coarse-to-fine segmentation framework that relies entirely on coarse-level
annotations, encompassing both target and complementary drawings, despite their
inherent noise. The framework works by introducing transition matrices in order
to model the inaccurate and incomplete regions in the coarse annotations. By
jointly training on multiple sets of coarse annotations, it progressively
refines the network's outputs and infers the true segmentation distribution,
achieving a robust approximation of precise labels through matrix-based
modeling. To validate the flexibility and effectiveness of the proposed method,
we demonstrate the results on two public cardiac imaging datasets, ACDC and
MSCMRseg, and further evaluate its performance on the UK Biobank dataset.
Experimental results indicate that our approach surpasses the state-of-the-art
weakly supervised methods and closely matches the fully supervised approach.

### [6] [MIDAR: Mimicking LiDAR Detection for Traffic Applications with a Lightweight Plug-and-Play Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02858)
*Tianheng Zhu,Yiheng Feng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MIDAR是一种LiDAR检测模拟模型，通过微观交通模拟器中的车辆特征近似真实LiDAR检测，填补了高保真模拟器与可扩展性模拟器之间的空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于大规模真实自动驾驶车辆部署不现实，现有模拟器在高保真与可扩展性之间存在矛盾，需要一种方法在微观交通模拟器中实现真实LiDAR检测建模。

Method: MIDAR利用车辆空间布局和尺寸预测真实LiDAR检测结果，构建RM-LoS图编码遮挡关系，并采用GRU增强的APPNP架构进行特征传播。

Result: MIDAR在nuScenes数据集上达到0.909的AUC，接近主流3D LiDAR检测模型CenterPoint的结果，并在两种协同感知交通应用中验证了其必要性。

Conclusion: MIDAR填补了模拟器间的技术空白，可无缝集成到交通模拟器和轨迹数据集中，为需要精确车辆观测的任务提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: As autonomous driving (AD) technology advances, increasing research has
focused on leveraging cooperative perception (CP) data collected from multiple
AVs to enhance traffic applications. Due to the impracticality of large-scale
real-world AV deployments, simulation has become the primary approach in most
studies. While game-engine-based simulators like CARLA generate high-fidelity
raw sensor data (e.g., LiDAR point clouds) which can be used to produce
realistic detection outputs, they face scalability challenges in multi-AV
scenarios. In contrast, microscopic traffic simulators such as SUMO scale
efficiently but lack perception modeling capabilities. To bridge this gap, we
propose MIDAR, a LiDAR detection mimicking model that approximates realistic
LiDAR detections using vehicle-level features readily available from
microscopic traffic simulators. Specifically, MIDAR predicts true positives
(TPs) and false negatives (FNs) from ideal LiDAR detection results based on the
spatial layouts and dimensions of surrounding vehicles. A Refined Multi-hop
Line-of-Sight (RM-LoS) graph is constructed to encode the occlusion
relationships among vehicles, upon which MIDAR employs a GRU-enhanced APPNP
architecture to propagate features from the ego AV and occluding vehicles to
the prediction target. MIDAR achieves an AUC of 0.909 in approximating the
detection results generated by CenterPoint, a mainstream 3D LiDAR detection
model, on the nuScenes AD dataset. Two CP-based traffic applications further
validate the necessity of such realistic detection modeling, particularly for
tasks requiring accurate individual vehicle observations (e.g., position,
speed, lane index). As demonstrated in the applications, MIDAR can be
seamlessly integrated into traffic simulators and trajectory datasets and will
be open-sourced upon publication.

### [7] [Evaluation and Analysis of Deep Neural Transformers and Convolutional Neural Networks on Modern Remote Sensing Datasets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02871)
*J. Alex Hurt,Trevor M. Bajkowski,Grant J. Scott,Curt H. Davis*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文探讨了基于Transformer的神经网络在高分辨率卫星图像中的物体检测性能，并与卷积网络进行了比较。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解Transformer在卫星图像任务中的表现，填补其在遥感数据中大规模比较的空白。

Method: 比较了11种检测算法（5种Transformer架构和6种卷积网络），在三个公开数据集上训练和评估了33个模型。

Result: 展示了Transformer架构在卫星图像物体检测中的先进性能。

Conclusion: Transformer在遥感图像任务中表现出色，为未来研究提供了方向。

Abstract: In 2012, AlexNet established deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) as
the state-of-the-art in CV, as these networks soon led in visual tasks for many
domains, including remote sensing. With the publication of Visual Transformers,
we are witnessing the second modern leap in computational vision, and as such,
it is imperative to understand how various transformer-based neural networks
perform on satellite imagery. While transformers have shown high levels of
performance in natural language processing and CV applications, they have yet
to be compared on a large scale to modern remote sensing data. In this paper,
we explore the use of transformer-based neural networks for object detection in
high-resolution electro-optical satellite imagery, demonstrating
state-of-the-art performance on a variety of publicly available benchmark data
sets. We compare eleven distinct bounding-box detection and localization
algorithms in this study, of which seven were published since 2020, and all
eleven since 2015. The performance of five transformer-based architectures is
compared with six convolutional networks on three state-of-the-art opensource
high-resolution remote sensing imagery datasets ranging in size and complexity.
Following the training and evaluation of thirty-three deep neural models, we
then discuss and analyze model performance across various feature extraction
methodologies and detection algorithms.

### [8] [VisuCraft: Enhancing Large Vision-Language Models for Complex Visual-Guided Creative Content Generation via Structured Information Extraction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02890)
*Rongxin Jiang,Robert Long,Chenghao Gu,Mingrui Yan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VisuCraft是一个新框架，通过结合多模态结构化信息提取器和动态提示生成模块，显著提升大型视觉语言模型在复杂视觉引导创意内容生成中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型视觉语言模型在生成长文本时难以保持高视觉保真度、真实创意和精确遵循用户指令。VisuCraft旨在解决这些问题。

Method: VisuCraft整合了多模态结构化信息提取器（E）和动态提示生成模块（G），提取图像细粒度属性并生成优化提示。

Result: 在ImageStoryGen-500K数据集上评估，VisuCraft在故事生成和诗歌创作等任务中表现优于基线模型，尤其在创意和指令遵循方面。

Conclusion: VisuCraft为大型视觉语言模型在高级创意AI应用中开辟了新潜力。

Abstract: This paper introduces VisuCraft, a novel framework designed to significantly
enhance the capabilities of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) in complex
visual-guided creative content generation. Existing LVLMs often exhibit
limitations in maintaining high visual fidelity, genuine creativity, and
precise adherence to nuanced user instructions when generating long-form texts.
VisuCraft addresses these challenges by integrating a multimodal structured
information extractor (E) and a dynamic prompt generation module (G). The
extractor distills fine-grained visual attributes from input images into a
rich, structured representation, which the dynamic prompt module then combines
with user instructions to create highly optimized prompts for underlying LVLMs
(e.g., LLaVA, InstructBLIP). Evaluated on the self-constructed
ImageStoryGen-500K dataset using VisuGen Metrics (Visual Grounding, Creativity,
and Instruction Adherence), VisuCraft consistently outperforms baseline LVLMs
across tasks like story generation and poetry composition. Our results
demonstrate remarkable improvements, particularly in creativity and instruction
adherence, validating VisuCraft's effectiveness in producing imaginative,
visually grounded, and user-aligned long-form creative text. This work unlocks
new potential for LVLMs in sophisticated creative AI applications.

*Mehrdad Moradi,Kamran Paynabar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新型的鲁棒去噪扩散模型，适用于仅含污染数据的无监督异常分割任务，性能优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统扩散模型依赖纯净正常数据训练，限制了实际应用；本文旨在解决仅含污染数据时的异常分割问题。

Method: 通过将数据最大似然估计转化为非线性回归问题，结合鲁棒回归，提出鲁棒去噪扩散概率模型。

Result: 在MVTec数据集上，AUROC和AUPRC分别提升8.08%和10.37%。

Conclusion: 该方法在污染数据场景下显著提升了异常分割性能，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Recent advancements in diffusion models have demonstrated significant success
in unsupervised anomaly segmentation. For anomaly segmentation, these models
are first trained on normal data; then, an anomalous image is noised to an
intermediate step, and the normal image is reconstructed through backward
diffusion. Unlike traditional statistical methods, diffusion models do not rely
on specific assumptions about the data or target anomalies, making them
versatile for use across different domains. However, diffusion models typically
assume access to normal data for training, limiting their applicability in
realistic settings. In this paper, we propose novel robust denoising diffusion
models for scenarios where only contaminated (i.e., a mix of normal and
anomalous) unlabeled data is available. By casting maximum likelihood
estimation of the data as a nonlinear regression problem, we reinterpret the
denoising diffusion probabilistic model through a regression lens. Using robust
regression, we derive a robust version of denoising diffusion probabilistic
models. Our novel framework offers flexibility in constructing various robust
diffusion models. Our experiments show that our approach outperforms current
state of the art diffusion models, for unsupervised anomaly segmentation when
only contaminated data is available. Our method outperforms existing
diffusion-based approaches, achieving up to 8.08\% higher AUROC and 10.37\%
higher AUPRC on MVTec datasets. The implementation code is available at:

*Mahnoor Fatima Saad,Ziad Al-Halah*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于材料控制的声学轮廓生成任务，通过用户定义的材料配置生成目标声学轮廓，采用编码器-解码器方法生成高质量的房间脉冲响应（RIR）。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究如何在特定音频-视觉特性的室内场景中，根据用户定义的材料配置动态生成目标声学轮廓。

Method: 采用编码器-解码器方法，从音频-视觉观察中编码场景关键属性，并根据用户提供的材料规格生成目标RIR。

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效编码材料信息并生成高保真RIR，为材料感知的声学轮廓生成提供了新思路。

Abstract: How would the sound in a studio change with a carpeted floor and acoustic
tiles on the walls? We introduce the task of material-controlled acoustic
profile generation, where, given an indoor scene with specific audio-visual
characteristics, the goal is to generate a target acoustic profile based on a
user-defined material configuration at inference time. We address this task
with a novel encoder-decoder approach that encodes the scene's key properties
from an audio-visual observation and generates the target Room Impulse Response
(RIR) conditioned on the material specifications provided by the user. Our
model enables the generation of diverse RIRs based on various material
configurations defined dynamically at inference time. To support this task, we
create a new benchmark, the Acoustic Wonderland Dataset, designed for
developing and evaluating material-aware RIR prediction methods under diverse
and challenging settings. Our results demonstrate that the proposed model
effectively encodes material information and generates high-fidelity RIRs,
outperforming several baselines and state-of-the-art methods.

### [11] [Following Route Instructions using Large Vision-Language Models: A Comparison between Low-level and Panoramic Action Spaces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02917)
*Vebjørn Haug Kåsene,Pierre Lison*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究探讨了现成的大型视觉语言模型（LVLMs）在视觉与语言导航（VLN）任务中的表现，发现其虽能完成任务，但效果不及专门设计的模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索现成LVLMs在VLN任务中的潜力，以及其是否支持低级和全景动作范式。

Method: 在Room-to-Room数据集上微调开源模型Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct，评估其在低级和全景动作空间的表现。

Result: 最佳模型在R2R测试集上达到41%的成功率，表明现成LVLMs虽能学习VLN任务，但效果仍不及专用模型。

Conclusion: 现成LVLMs在VLN任务中表现有限，需进一步优化或专用设计。

Abstract: Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) refers to the task of enabling
autonomous robots to navigate unfamiliar environments by following natural
language instructions. While recent Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have
shown promise in this task, most current VLM systems rely on models
specifically designed and optimized for navigation, leaving the potential of
off-the-shelf LVLMs underexplored. Furthermore, while older VLN approaches used
low-level action spaces with egocentric views and atomic actions (such as "turn
left" or "move forward"), newer models tend to favor panoramic action spaces
with discrete navigable viewpoints. This paper investigates (1) whether
off-the-shelf LVLMs (fine-tuned without architectural modifications or
simulator-based training) can effectively support VLN tasks and (2) whether
such models can support both low-level and panoramic action paradigms. To this
end, we fine-tune the open-source model Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct on the
Room-to-Room (R2R) dataset and evaluate its empirical performance across both
low-level and panoramic action spaces. The best resulting model achieves a 41%
success rate on the R2R test set, demonstrating that while off-the-shelf LVLMs
can learn to perform Vision-and-Language Navigation, they still lag behind
models specifically designed for this task.

### [12] [How Diffusion Prior Landscapes Shape the Posterior in Blind Deconvolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02923)
*Minh-Hai Nguyen,Edouard Pauwels,Pierre Weiss*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文探讨了在盲去卷积中使用最大后验（MAP）估计时，稀疏促进先验倾向于模糊解的问题，并提出扩散先验模型揭示后验分布中的局部极小值对应自然图像，从而解决盲去卷积问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: MAP估计在盲去卷积中因稀疏先验导致模糊解，限制了其有效性。本文旨在通过扩散先验模型重新审视这一问题。

Method: 通过经验分析扩散先验的似然景观，发现模糊图像具有更高似然性，且景观中包含多个局部极小值对应自然图像。基于此，理论分析了盲去卷积后验分布。

Result: MAP估计倾向于产生尖锐滤波器和模糊解，而后验的局部极小值（可通过梯度下降获得）对应自然图像，有效解决盲去卷积问题。

Conclusion: 克服MAP限制需良好局部初始化以找到后验景观中的局部极小值，实验验证了扩散先验和优化技术的改进潜力。

Abstract: The Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) estimation is a widely used framework in blind
deconvolution to recover sharp images from blurred observations. The estimated
image and blur filter are defined as the maximizer of the posterior
distribution. However, when paired with sparsity-promoting image priors, MAP
estimation has been shown to favors blurry solutions, limiting its
effectiveness. In this paper, we revisit this result using diffusion-based
priors, a class of models that capture realistic image distributions. Through
an empirical examination of the prior's likelihood landscape, we uncover two
key properties: first, blurry images tend to have higher likelihoods; second,
the landscape contains numerous local minimizers that correspond to natural
images. Building on these insights, we provide a theoretical analysis of the
blind deblurring posterior. This reveals that the MAP estimator tends to
produce sharp filters (close to the Dirac delta function) and blurry solutions.
However local minimizers of the posterior, which can be obtained with gradient
descent, correspond to realistic, natural images, effectively solving the blind
deconvolution problem. Our findings suggest that overcoming MAP's limitations
requires good local initialization to local minima in the posterior landscape.
We validate our analysis with numerical experiments, demonstrating the
practical implications of our insights for designing improved priors and
optimization techniques.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究了ImageNet预训练对超小型模型（参数<1M）在红外视觉模态目标检测任务中鲁棒性的影响，发现预训练仍有益但存在收益递减点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索预训练对小型模型在嵌入式设备上的鲁棒性影响，填补现有研究空白。

Method: 构建两个超小型骨干网络家族，系统评估其在三个数据集上的表现。

Result: 预训练对小型模型仍有益，但模型过小时鲁棒性收益递减。

Conclusion: 建议使用预训练并避免过小模型，以确保在域外条件下的稳定性。

Abstract: Many real-world applications require recognition models that are robust to
different operational conditions and modalities, but at the same time run on
small embedded devices, with limited hardware. While for normal size models,
pre-training is known to be very beneficial in accuracy and robustness, for
small models, that can be employed for embedded and edge devices, its effect is
not clear. In this work, we investigate the effect of ImageNet pretraining on
increasingly small backbone architectures (ultra-small models, with $<$1M
parameters) with respect to robustness in downstream object detection tasks in
the infrared visual modality. Using scaling laws derived from standard object
recognition architectures, we construct two ultra-small backbone families and
systematically study their performance. Our experiments on three different
datasets reveal that while ImageNet pre-training is still useful, beyond a
certain capacity threshold, it offers diminishing returns in terms of
out-of-distribution detection robustness. Therefore, we advise practitioners to
still use pre-training and, when possible avoid too small models as while they
might work well for in-domain problems, they are brittle when working
conditions are different.

TL;DR: X-Actor是一个音频驱动的肖像动画框架，通过单张参考图像和音频生成逼真、情感丰富的说话头部视频。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法多关注唇同步和短时视觉保真度，而X-Actor旨在实现演员级、长时肖像表演，捕捉动态情感。

Method: 采用两阶段解耦生成流程：音频条件自回归扩散模型预测面部运动潜在标记，扩散视频合成模块将其转化为高保真视频。

Result: X-Actor生成了超越标准说话头部动画的表演，在长时音频驱动情感肖像表演中达到最优效果。

Conclusion: X-Actor通过解耦设计和扩散训练范式，实现了长时情感丰富的面部运动预测和高保真视频生成。

Abstract: We present X-Actor, a novel audio-driven portrait animation framework that
generates lifelike, emotionally expressive talking head videos from a single
reference image and an input audio clip. Unlike prior methods that emphasize
lip synchronization and short-range visual fidelity in constrained speaking
scenarios, X-Actor enables actor-quality, long-form portrait performance
capturing nuanced, dynamically evolving emotions that flow coherently with the
rhythm and content of speech. Central to our approach is a two-stage decoupled
generation pipeline: an audio-conditioned autoregressive diffusion model that
predicts expressive yet identity-agnostic facial motion latent tokens within a
long temporal context window, followed by a diffusion-based video synthesis
module that translates these motions into high-fidelity video animations. By
operating in a compact facial motion latent space decoupled from visual and
identity cues, our autoregressive diffusion model effectively captures
long-range correlations between audio and facial dynamics through a
diffusion-forcing training paradigm, enabling infinite-length emotionally-rich
motion prediction without error accumulation. Extensive experiments demonstrate

### [15] [Towards Robust Image Denoising with Scale Equivariance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02967)
*Dawei Zhang,Xiaojie Guo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于尺度等变性的盲去噪框架，通过异构归一化模块和交互门控模块提升模型对空间异质噪声的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有去噪模型在空间异质噪声（OOD条件）下泛化能力不足，尺度等变性被视为提升鲁棒性的核心归纳偏置。

Method: 提出包含异构归一化模块（HNM）和交互门控模块（IGM）的盲去噪框架，HNM稳定特征分布，IGM通过门控交互调节信息流。

Result: 模型在合成和真实世界数据集上优于现有方法，尤其在空间异质噪声条件下表现突出。

Conclusion: 尺度等变性是提升去噪模型OOD鲁棒性的有效途径，提出的框架具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Despite notable advances in image denoising, existing models often struggle
to generalize beyond in-distribution noise patterns, particularly when
confronted with out-of-distribution (OOD) conditions characterized by spatially
variant noise. This generalization gap remains a fundamental yet underexplored
challenge. In this work, we investigate \emph{scale equivariance} as a core
inductive bias for improving OOD robustness. We argue that incorporating
scale-equivariant structures enables models to better adapt from training on
spatially uniform noise to inference on spatially non-uniform degradations.
Building on this insight, we propose a robust blind denoising framework
equipped with two key components: a Heterogeneous Normalization Module (HNM)
and an Interactive Gating Module (IGM). HNM stabilizes feature distributions
and dynamically corrects features under varying noise intensities, while IGM
facilitates effective information modulation via gated interactions between
signal and feature paths. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our model
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods on both synthetic and
real-world benchmarks, especially under spatially heterogeneous noise. Code
will be made publicly available.

*Alakh Desai,Nuno Vasconcelos*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ANSWER是一种无需训练的采样方法，通过结合负提示和分类器自由引导（CFG）来提升扩散模型生成图像的提示忠实度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在生成高质量图像时，提示忠实度和质量存在显著差异，负提示虽能改善但依赖外部资源且不完整。

Method: 提出ANSWER方法，利用扩散模型内部对否定的理解，结合CFG，无需显式负提示即可实现负条件采样。

Result: ANSWER在多个基准测试中优于基线方法，人类偏好度是其他方法的2倍。

Conclusion: ANSWER是一种通用且高效的训练免费技术，显著提升了扩散模型的提示忠实度和生成质量。

Abstract: Diffusion models (DMs) have demonstrated an unparalleled ability to create
diverse and high-fidelity images from text prompts. However, they are also
well-known to vary substantially regarding both prompt adherence and quality.
Negative prompting was introduced to improve prompt compliance by specifying
what an image must not contain. Previous works have shown the existence of an
ideal negative prompt that can maximize the odds of the positive prompt. In
this work, we explore relations between negative prompting and classifier-free
guidance (CFG) to develop a sampling procedure, {\it Adaptive Negative Sampling
Without External Resources} (ANSWER), that accounts for both positive and
negative conditions from a single prompt. This leverages the internal
understanding of negation by the diffusion model to increase the odds of
generating images faithful to the prompt. ANSWER is a training-free technique,
applicable to any model that supports CFG, and allows for negative grounding of
image concepts without an explicit negative prompts, which are lossy and
incomplete. Experiments show that adding ANSWER to existing DMs outperforms the
baselines on multiple benchmarks and is preferred by humans 2x more over the
other methods.

Motivation: 现有多领域学习架构中的共享LoRA和领域特定LoRA是否有效捕获领域特定信息尚不明确。

Method: 提出一种方法，将共享和领域特定LoRA分别置于预训练权重的列子空间和左零子空间中。

Result: 在三个动作识别数据集（UCF101、Kinetics400和HMDB51）上验证了方法的有效性，并分析了LoRA权重的维度。

Conclusion: 该方法在某些情况下有效，且通过分析LoRA权重维度提供了进一步见解。

Abstract: Existing architectures of multi-domain learning have two types of adapters:
shared LoRA for all domains and domain-specific LoRA for each particular
domain. However, it remains unclear whether this structure effectively captures
domain-specific information. In this paper, we propose a method that ensures
that shared and domain-specific LoRAs exist in different subspaces;
specifically, the column and left null subspaces of the pre-trained weights. We
apply the proposed method to action recognition with three datasets (UCF101,
Kinetics400, and HMDB51) and demonstrate its effectiveness in some cases along
with the analysis of the dimensions of LoRA weights.

domain adaptation between RGB and edge information using edge frames in
addition to RGB frames to counter the static bias issue. Experiments
demonstrate that the proposed method effectively suppresses static bias with a
lower computational cost, allowing for more robust action recognition than
previous approaches.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AFOG是一种针对目标检测Transformer的对抗攻击方法，通过注意力机制聚焦脆弱区域，提升攻击效果，适用于CNN和Transformer检测器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对抗攻击方法对Transformer检测器效果有限，需一种通用且高效的攻击方法。

Method: AFOG利用可学习的注意力机制，结合特征损失和迭代注入扰动，攻击目标检测模型。

Result: AFOG在12个大型Transformer检测器上表现优异，攻击效果提升30.6%，速度更快且扰动更隐蔽。

Conclusion: AFOG是一种高效、隐蔽且通用的对抗攻击方法，显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Adversarial perturbations are useful tools for exposing vulnerabilities in
neural networks. Existing adversarial perturbation methods for object detection
are either limited to attacking CNN-based detectors or weak against
transformer-based detectors. This paper presents an Attention-Focused Offensive
Gradient (AFOG) attack against object detection transformers. By design, AFOG
is neural-architecture agnostic and effective for attacking both large
transformer-based object detectors and conventional CNN-based detectors with a
unified adversarial attention framework. This paper makes three original
contributions. First, AFOG utilizes a learnable attention mechanism that
focuses perturbations on vulnerable image regions in multi-box detection tasks,
increasing performance over non-attention baselines by up to 30.6%. Second,
AFOG's attack loss is formulated by integrating two types of feature loss
through learnable attention updates with iterative injection of adversarial
perturbations. Finally, AFOG is an efficient and stealthy adversarial
perturbation method. It probes the weak spots of detection transformers by
adding strategically generated and visually imperceptible perturbations which
can cause well-trained object detection models to fail. Extensive experiments
conducted with twelve large detection transformers on COCO demonstrate the
efficacy of AFOG. Our empirical results also show that AFOG outperforms
existing attacks on transformer-based and CNN-based object detectors by up to
83% with superior speed and imperceptibility. Code is available at

*Fan Yang,Yihao Huang,Jiayi Zhu,Ling Shi,Geguang Pu,Jin Song Dong,Kailong Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于扩散模型生成过程中的预测噪声来检测NSFW内容的方法（IGD），效果优于现有基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在生成高质量图像的同时可能被滥用生成NSFW内容，现有方法主要关注生成前或生成后的检测，而生成过程中的检测尚未充分探索。

Method: 利用扩散过程中预测的噪声作为内部信号，通过语义线索区分NSFW与良性提示。

Result: 在七类NSFW内容上，IGD的平均检测准确率达到91.32%，优于七种基线方法。

Conclusion: IGD是一种简单有效的NSFW检测方法，特别适用于对抗性提示场景。

Abstract: Diffusion-based text-to-image (T2I) models enable high-quality image
generation but also pose significant risks of misuse, particularly in producing
not-safe-for-work (NSFW) content. While prior detection methods have focused on
filtering prompts before generation or moderating images afterward, the
in-generation phase of diffusion models remains largely unexplored for NSFW
detection. In this paper, we introduce In-Generation Detection (IGD), a simple
yet effective approach that leverages the predicted noise during the diffusion
process as an internal signal to identify NSFW content. This approach is
motivated by preliminary findings suggesting that the predicted noise may
capture semantic cues that differentiate NSFW from benign prompts, even when
the prompts are adversarially crafted. Experiments conducted on seven NSFW
categories show that IGD achieves an average detection accuracy of 91.32% over
naive and adversarial NSFW prompts, outperforming seven baseline methods.

*Xinhui Li,Xiaojie Guo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为MGFC的新框架，通过多粒度特征校准提升域广义语义分割（DGSS）的泛化能力，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有DGSS方法主要关注全局特征微调，忽视了特征层次的分层适应，而这对密集预测至关重要。

Method: MGFC框架通过从粗到细的特征校准，依次调整全局语义、类别区分性和空间细节，实现分层适应。

Result: 在基准数据集上的实验表明，MGFC优于现有DGSS方法。

Conclusion: 多粒度适应能有效提升语义分割任务的域泛化能力。

Abstract: Domain Generalized Semantic Segmentation (DGSS) aims to improve the
generalization ability of models across unseen domains without access to target
data during training. Recent advances in DGSS have increasingly exploited
vision foundation models (VFMs) via parameter-efficient fine-tuning strategies.
However, most existing approaches concentrate on global feature fine-tuning,
while overlooking hierarchical adaptation across feature levels, which is
crucial for precise dense prediction. In this paper, we propose
Multi-Granularity Feature Calibration (MGFC), a novel framework that performs
coarse-to-fine alignment of VFM features to enhance robustness under domain
shifts. Specifically, MGFC first calibrates coarse-grained features to capture
global contextual semantics and scene-level structure. Then, it refines
medium-grained features by promoting category-level feature discriminability.
Finally, fine-grained features are calibrated through high-frequency spatial
detail enhancement. By performing hierarchical and granularity-aware
calibration, MGFC effectively transfers the generalization strengths of VFMs to
the domain-specific task of DGSS. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets
demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art DGSS approaches,
highlighting the effectiveness of multi-granularity adaptation for the semantic
segmentation task of domain generalization.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的视频问答任务SceneQA，强调场景细节感知与推理能力，并开发了LVSQA数据集。提出SLFG方法，通过语义连贯的场景帧组合提升MLLMs在长视频中的理解能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLMs在长视频理解中表现不佳，主要因资源限制无法处理所有帧信息，且现有框架与任务不符合实际需求。

Method: 提出SLFG方法，结合语义连贯的场景帧，利用场景定位和动态帧重组机制，无需修改原模型架构。

Result: 实验证明SLFG在多个长视频基准测试中表现优异。

Conclusion: SLFG方法显著提升了MLLMs的长视频理解能力，具有即插即用的优势。

Abstract: Current Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) often perform poorly in long
video understanding, primarily due to resource limitations that prevent them
from processing all video frames and their associated information. Efficiently
extracting relevant information becomes a challenging task. Existing frameworks
and evaluation tasks focus on identifying specific frames containing core
objects from a large number of irrelevant frames, which does not align with the
practical needs of real-world applications. To address this issue, we propose a
new scenario under the video question-answering task, SceneQA, which emphasizes
scene-based detail perception and reasoning abilities. And we develop the LVSQA
dataset to support the SceneQA task, which is built upon carefully selected
videos from LVBench and contains a new collection of question-answer pairs to
promote a more fair evaluation of MLLMs' scene perception abilities in long
videos. Inspired by human cognition, we introduce a novel method called SLFG.
The core idea of SLFG is to combine individual frames into semantically
coherent scene frames. By leveraging scene localization methods and dynamic
frame reassembly mechanisms, SLFG significantly enhances the understanding
capabilities of existing MLLMs in long videos. SLFG requires no modification to
the original model architecture and boasts excellent plug-and-play usability.
Experimental results show that this method performs exceptionally well in
several long video benchmark tests. Code and dataset will be released at
http://www.slfg.pkuzwh.cn.

TL;DR: SA-3DGS是一种通过重要性评分和聚类压缩高斯点的方法，显著减少存储需求并保持渲染质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D高斯泼溅方法需要大量高斯点，导致存储需求高且难以识别不重要的点，影响压缩和渲染性能。

Method: SA-3DGS通过学习重要性评分识别不重要高斯点，结合重要性感知聚类和代码本修复模块优化压缩。

Result: 实验显示SA-3DGS实现了高达66倍的压缩，同时保持或提升渲染质量，且适用于其他剪枝方法。

Conclusion: SA-3DGS在存储压缩和渲染质量上表现优异，具有强泛化能力。

Abstract: Recent advancements in 3D Gaussian Splatting have enhanced efficient and
high-quality novel view synthesis. However, representing scenes requires a
large number of Gaussian points, leading to high storage demands and limiting
practical deployment. The latest methods facilitate the compression of Gaussian
models but struggle to identify truly insignificant Gaussian points in the
scene, leading to a decline in subsequent Gaussian pruning, compression
quality, and rendering performance. To address this issue, we propose SA-3DGS,
a method that significantly reduces storage costs while maintaining rendering
quality. SA-3DGS learns an importance score to automatically identify the least
significant Gaussians in scene reconstruction, thereby enabling effective
pruning and redundancy reduction. Next, the importance-aware clustering module
compresses Gaussians attributes more accurately into the codebook, improving
the codebook's expressive capability while reducing model size. Finally, the
codebook repair module leverages contextual scene information to repair the
codebook, thereby recovering the original Gaussian point attributes and
mitigating the degradation in rendering quality caused by information loss.
Experimental results on several benchmark datasets show that our method
achieves up to 66x compression while maintaining or even improving rendering
quality. The proposed Gaussian pruning approach is not only adaptable to but
also improves other pruning-based methods (e.g., LightGaussian), showcasing
excellent performance and strong generalization ability.

Result: 在CelebIPVid数据集上，MoCA在面部相似度上比现有方法高出5%。

Conclusion: MoCA显著提升了文本到视频生成中的身份一致性，具有跨种族泛化能力。

Abstract: Achieving ID-preserving text-to-video (T2V) generation remains challenging
despite recent advances in diffusion-based models. Existing approaches often
fail to capture fine-grained facial dynamics or maintain temporal identity
coherence. To address these limitations, we propose MoCA, a novel Video
Diffusion Model built on a Diffusion Transformer (DiT) backbone, incorporating
a Mixture of Cross-Attention mechanism inspired by the Mixture-of-Experts
paradigm. Our framework improves inter-frame identity consistency by embedding
MoCA layers into each DiT block, where Hierarchical Temporal Pooling captures
identity features over varying timescales, and Temporal-Aware Cross-Attention
Experts dynamically model spatiotemporal relationships. We further incorporate
a Latent Video Perceptual Loss to enhance identity coherence and fine-grained
details across video frames. To train this model, we collect CelebIPVid, a
dataset of 10,000 high-resolution videos from 1,000 diverse individuals,
promoting cross-ethnicity generalization. Extensive experiments on CelebIPVid
show that MoCA outperforms existing T2V methods by over 5% across Face
similarity.

Abstract: Cross-video question answering presents significant challenges beyond
traditional single-video understanding, particularly in establishing meaningful
connections across video streams and managing the complexity of multi-source
information retrieval. We introduce VideoForest, a novel framework that
addresses these challenges through person-anchored hierarchical reasoning. Our
approach leverages person-level features as natural bridge points between
videos, enabling effective cross-video understanding without requiring
end-to-end training. VideoForest integrates three key innovations: 1) a
human-anchored feature extraction mechanism that employs ReID and tracking
algorithms to establish robust spatiotemporal relationships across multiple
video sources; 2) a multi-granularity spanning tree structure that
hierarchically organizes visual content around person-level trajectories; and
3) a multi-agent reasoning framework that efficiently traverses this
hierarchical structure to answer complex cross-video queries. To evaluate our
approach, we develop CrossVideoQA, a comprehensive benchmark dataset
specifically designed for person-centric cross-video analysis. Experimental
results demonstrate VideoForest's superior performance in cross-video reasoning
tasks, achieving 71.93% accuracy in person recognition, 83.75% in behavior
analysis, and 51.67% in summarization and reasoning, significantly
outperforming existing methods. Our work establishes a new paradigm for
cross-video understanding by unifying multiple video streams through
person-level features, enabling sophisticated reasoning across distributed
visual information while maintaining computational efficiency.

Conclusion: MIT数据集和CovOG模型为多人对话视频生成提供了新基准，推动了该领域的研究。

Abstract: Existing studies on talking video generation have predominantly focused on
single-person monologues or isolated facial animations, limiting their
applicability to realistic multi-human interactions. To bridge this gap, we
introduce MIT, a large-scale dataset specifically designed for multi-human
talking video generation. To this end, we develop an automatic pipeline that
collects and annotates multi-person conversational videos. The resulting
dataset comprises 12 hours of high-resolution footage, each featuring two to
four speakers, with fine-grained annotations of body poses and speech
interactions. It captures natural conversational dynamics in multi-speaker
scenario, offering a rich resource for studying interactive visual behaviors.
To demonstrate the potential of MIT, we furthur propose CovOG, a baseline model
for this novel task. It integrates a Multi-Human Pose Encoder (MPE) to handle
varying numbers of speakers by aggregating individual pose embeddings, and an
Interactive Audio Driver (IAD) to modulate head dynamics based on
speaker-specific audio features. Together, these components showcase the
feasibility and challenges of generating realistic multi-human talking videos,
establishing MIT as a valuable benchmark for future research. The code is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有面部滤镜在遮挡情况下性能下降，需要一种能够精细分离遮挡物与面部区域的方法。

Method: 提出FaceMat框架，采用两阶段训练管道，结合教师-学生模型和不确定性感知知识蒸馏。

Result: FaceMat在多个基准测试中优于现有方法，提升了真实视频场景中的视觉质量和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: FaceMat为遮挡感知的面部遮罩任务提供了高效解决方案，并开源了代码和数据集。

Abstract: Face filters have become a key element of short-form video content, enabling
a wide array of visual effects such as stylization and face swapping. However,
their performance often degrades in the presence of occlusions, where objects
like hands, hair, or accessories obscure the face. To address this limitation,
we introduce the novel task of face matting, which estimates fine-grained alpha
mattes to separate occluding elements from facial regions. We further present
FaceMat, a trimap-free, uncertainty-aware framework that predicts high-quality
alpha mattes under complex occlusions. Our approach leverages a two-stage
training pipeline: a teacher model is trained to jointly estimate alpha mattes
and per-pixel uncertainty using a negative log-likelihood (NLL) loss, and this
uncertainty is then used to guide the student model through spatially adaptive
knowledge distillation. This formulation enables the student to focus on
ambiguous or occluded regions, improving generalization and preserving semantic
consistency. Unlike previous approaches that rely on trimaps or segmentation
masks, our framework requires no auxiliary inputs making it well-suited for
real-time applications. In addition, we reformulate the matting objective by
explicitly treating skin as foreground and occlusions as background, enabling
clearer compositing strategies. To support this task, we newly constructed
CelebAMat, a large-scale synthetic dataset specifically designed for
occlusion-aware face matting. Extensive experiments show that FaceMat
outperforms state-of-the-art methods across multiple benchmarks, enhancing the
visual quality and robustness of face filters in real-world, unconstrained
video scenarios. The source code and CelebAMat dataset are available at

TL;DR: CHARM框架通过互补学习实现模态和谐而非同质化，显著提升多模态语义分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通过特征对齐实现模态同质化，但削弱了各模态的独特优势和互补性。

Method: 提出CHARM框架，包含互感知单元（MPU）和双路径优化策略（CoL和InE），实现隐式对齐和保护模态特性。

Result: 在多个数据集和骨干网络上，CHARM显著优于基线，尤其在脆弱模态上表现突出。

Conclusion: CHARM将焦点从同质化转向和谐化，实现了多样性的真正互补。

Abstract: Modality-agnostic Semantic Segmentation (MaSS) aims to achieve robust scene
understanding across arbitrary combinations of input modality. Existing methods
typically rely on explicit feature alignment to achieve modal homogenization,
which dilutes the distinctive strengths of each modality and destroys their
inherent complementarity. To achieve cooperative harmonization rather than
homogenization, we propose CHARM, a novel complementary learning framework
designed to implicitly align content while preserving modality-specific
advantages through two components: (1) Mutual Perception Unit (MPU), enabling
implicit alignment through window-based cross-modal interaction, where
modalities serve as both queries and contexts for each other to discover
modality-interactive correspondences; (2) A dual-path optimization strategy
that decouples training into Collaborative Learning Strategy (CoL) for
complementary fusion learning and Individual Enhancement Strategy (InE) for
protected modality-specific optimization. Experiments across multiple datasets
and backbones indicate that CHARM consistently outperform the baselines, with
significant increment on the fragile modalities. This work shifts the focus
from model homogenization to harmonization, enabling cross-modal
complementarity for true harmony in diversity.

Abstract: This study introduces a novel framework, "Comprehensive Optimization and
Refinement through Ensemble Fusion in Domain Adaptation for Person
Re-identification (CORE-ReID)", to address an Unsupervised Domain Adaptation
(UDA) for Person Re-identification (ReID). The framework utilizes CycleGAN to
generate diverse data that harmonizes differences in image characteristics from
different camera sources in the pre-training stage. In the fine-tuning stage,
based on a pair of teacher-student networks, the framework integrates
multi-view features for multi-level clustering to derive diverse pseudo labels.
A learnable Ensemble Fusion component that focuses on fine-grained local
information within global features is introduced to enhance learning
comprehensiveness and avoid ambiguity associated with multiple pseudo-labels.
Experimental results on three common UDAs in Person ReID demonstrate
significant performance gains over state-of-the-art approaches. Additional
enhancements, such as Efficient Channel Attention Block and Bidirectional Mean
Feature Normalization mitigate deviation effects and adaptive fusion of global
and local features using the ResNet-based model, further strengthening the
framework. The proposed framework ensures clarity in fusion features, avoids
ambiguity, and achieves high ac-curacy in terms of Mean Average Precision,
Top-1, Top-5, and Top-10, positioning it as an advanced and effective solution
for the UDA in Person ReID. Our codes and models are available at

Conclusion: SSFMamba通过有效融合空间与频率域特征，显著提升了3D医学图像分割的性能，证明了频率域信息在全局建模中的重要性。

Abstract: In light of the spatial domain's limited capacity for modeling global context
in 3D medical image segmentation, emerging approaches have begun to incorporate
frequency domain representations. However, straightforward feature extraction
strategies often overlook the unique properties of frequency domain
information, such as conjugate symmetry. They also fail to account for the
fundamental differences in data distribution between the spatial and frequency
domains, which can ultimately dilute or obscure the complementary strengths
that frequency-based representations offer. In this paper, we propose SSFMamba,
a Mamba based Symmetry-driven Spatial-Frequency feature fusion network for 3D
medical image segmentation. SSFMamba employs a complementary dual-branch
architecture that extracts features from both the spatial and frequency
domains, and leverages a Mamba block to fuse these heterogeneous features to
preserve global context while reinforcing local details. In the frequency
domain branch, we harness Mamba's exceptional capability to extract global
contextual information in conjunction with the synergistic effect of frequency
domain features to further enhance global modeling. Moreover, we design a 3D
multi-directional scanning mechanism to strengthen the fusion of local and
global cues. Extensive experiments on the BraTS2020 and BraTS2023 datasets
demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods
across various evaluation metrics.

TL;DR: RobustGS模块通过多视图特征增强和语义感知策略，显著提升了3D高斯泼溅（3DGS）在恶劣成像条件下的鲁棒性，实现了高质量的3D重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有前馈3DGS方法假设输入多视图图像干净且高质量，但实际场景中图像常受噪声、低光或雨等条件影响，导致重建质量下降。

Method: 提出RobustGS模块，包括通用退化学习器和语义感知状态空间模型，增强退化感知并聚合语义信息。

Result: 实验表明，RobustGS在多种退化条件下均能实现最先进的3D重建质量。

Conclusion: RobustGS模块可无缝集成现有方法，显著提升3D重建的鲁棒性和质量。

Abstract: Feedforward 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) overcomes the limitations of
optimization-based 3DGS by enabling fast and high-quality reconstruction
without the need for per-scene optimization. However, existing feedforward
approaches typically assume that input multi-view images are clean and
high-quality. In real-world scenarios, images are often captured under
challenging conditions such as noise, low light, or rain, resulting in
inaccurate geometry and degraded 3D reconstruction. To address these
challenges, we propose a general and efficient multi-view feature enhancement
module, RobustGS, which substantially improves the robustness of feedforward
3DGS methods under various adverse imaging conditions, enabling high-quality 3D
reconstruction. The RobustGS module can be seamlessly integrated into existing
pretrained pipelines in a plug-and-play manner to enhance reconstruction
robustness. Specifically, we introduce a novel component, Generalized
Degradation Learner, designed to extract generic representations and
distributions of multiple degradations from multi-view inputs, thereby
enhancing degradation-awareness and improving the overall quality of 3D
reconstruction. In addition, we propose a novel semantic-aware state-space
model. It first leverages the extracted degradation representations to enhance
corrupted inputs in the feature space. Then, it employs a semantic-aware
strategy to aggregate semantically similar information across different views,
enabling the extraction of fine-grained cross-view correspondences and further
improving the quality of 3D representations. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our approach, when integrated into existing methods in a plug-and-play
manner, consistently achieves state-of-the-art reconstruction quality across
various types of degradations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注人口统计属性（如种族和性别），而更广泛属性的公平性尚未充分探索。

Method: 利用大型语言模型（LLMs）构建开放集偏见属性知识库，评估LVLMs在细粒度属性上的公平性。

Result: LVLMs在多样属性上表现出偏见，文化、环境和行为因素对决策的影响比传统人口统计属性更显著。

Conclusion: 研究强调了LVLMs公平性问题的复杂性，需更广泛地考虑非传统属性。

Abstract: The rapid expansion of applications using Large Vision-Language Models
(LVLMs), such as GPT-4o, has raised significant concerns about their fairness.
While existing studies primarily focus on demographic attributes such as race
and gender, fairness across a broader range of attributes remains largely
unexplored. In this study, we construct an open-set knowledge base of bias
attributes leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) and evaluate the fairness of
LVLMs across finer-grained attributes. Our experimental results reveal that
LVLMs exhibit biased outputs across a diverse set of attributes and further
demonstrate that cultural, environmental, and behavioral factors have a more
pronounced impact on LVLM decision-making than traditional demographic
attributes.

Result: 实验表明，$C^2Aug$在多个评估指标上均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: $C^2Aug$通过增加伪袋多样性和引入对比学习框架，显著提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Recent pseudo-bag augmentation methods for Multiple Instance Learning
(MIL)-based Whole Slide Image (WSI) classification sample instances from a
limited number of bags, resulting in constrained diversity. To address this
issue, we propose Contrastive Cross-Bag Augmentation ($C^2Aug$) to sample
instances from all bags with the same class to increase the diversity of
pseudo-bags. However, introducing new instances into the pseudo-bag increases
the number of critical instances (e.g., tumor instances). This increase results
in a reduced occurrence of pseudo-bags containing few critical instances,
thereby limiting model performance, particularly on test slides with small
tumor areas. To address this, we introduce a bag-level and group-level
contrastive learning framework to enhance the discrimination of features with
distinct semantic meanings, thereby improving model performance. Experimental
results demonstrate that $C^2Aug$ consistently outperforms state-of-the-art
approaches across multiple evaluation metrics.

Conclusion: 提出的框架有效利用了语义信息，显著提升了持续学习的性能，代码将公开。

Abstract: Continual learning is essential for medical image classification systems to
adapt to dynamically evolving clinical environments. The integration of
multimodal information can significantly enhance continual learning of image
classes. However, while existing approaches do utilize textual modality
information, they solely rely on simplistic templates with a class name,
thereby neglecting richer semantic information. To address these limitations,
we propose a novel framework that harnesses visual concepts generated by large
language models (LLMs) as discriminative semantic guidance. Our method
dynamically constructs a visual concept pool with a similarity-based filtering
mechanism to prevent redundancy. Then, to integrate the concepts into the
continual learning process, we employ a cross-modal image-concept attention
module, coupled with an attention loss. Through attention, the module can
leverage the semantic knowledge from relevant visual concepts and produce
class-representative fused features for classification. Experiments on medical
and natural image datasets show our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance, demonstrating the effectiveness and superiority of our method. We
will release the code publicly.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决GRPO在长视频多模态推理中的数据效率低、优势消失问题和均匀信用分配不足的局限性。

Method: 引入AVATAR框架，包含离策略训练架构和时间优势分配策略（TAS）。

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现优异，性能提升显著，样本效率提高35%以上。

Conclusion: AVATAR有效解决了现有方法的局限性，在多模态长视频推理任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Multimodal reasoning over long-horizon video is challenging due to the need
for precise spatiotemporal fusion and alignment across modalities. While recent
methods such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) have shown promise in
this domain, they suffer from three key limitations: (1) data inefficiency from
their on-policy design, (2) a vanishing advantage problem, where identical or
near-identical rewards within a group eliminate the learning signal by
producing zero-valued advantages, and (3) uniform credit assignment that fails
to emphasize critical reasoning steps. We introduce AVATAR (Audio-Video Agent
for Alignment and Reasoning), a framework that addresses these limitations
through two core components: (1) an off-policy training architecture that
improves sample efficiency and resolves vanishing advantages by reusing past
experiences with greater reward diversity, and (2) Temporal Advantage Shaping
(TAS), a novel credit assignment strategy that upweights key reasoning phases
during learning. AVATAR achieves strong performance across various benchmarks,
outperforming the Qwen2.5-Omni baseline by +5.4on MMVU, +4.9 on OmniBench, and
+4.5 on Video-Holmes, while demonstrating over 35% higher sample efficiency.

TL;DR: 论文提出Causal CLIP Adapter (CCA)，通过无监督独立成分分析(ICA)显式解耦CLIP提取的视觉特征，减少可训练参数并避免过拟合，同时利用CLIP的跨模态对齐提升分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有少样本学习(FSL)方法依赖纠缠表示，需从有限监督中隐式恢复解耦过程，阻碍有效适应。

Method: CCA结合ICA解耦视觉特征，并通过单向（微调文本分类器）和双向（跨注意力机制）增强CLIP的跨模态对齐。

Result: 在11个基准数据集上，CCA在少样本性能和分布偏移鲁棒性上优于现有方法，且计算高效。

Conclusion: CCA通过显式解耦和跨模态对齐提升少样本学习性能，为FSL提供了一种高效且鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: Few-shot learning (FSL) often requires effective adaptation of models using
limited labeled data. However, most existing FSL methods rely on entangled
representations, requiring the model to implicitly recover the unmixing process
to obtain disentangled representations using only limited supervision, which
hinders effective adaptation. Recent theoretical studies show that multimodal
contrastive learning methods, such as CLIP, can disentangle latent
representations up to linear transformations. In light of this, we propose the
Causal CLIP Adapter (CCA), a novel framework that explicitly disentangles
visual features extracted from CLIP using unsupervised Independent Component
Analysis (ICA). This removes the need to learn the unmixing process from the
labeled data, thereby reducing the number of trainable parameters and
mitigating overfitting. Taking a step further, while ICA can obtain visual
disentangled representations, it may also disrupt CLIP's intra- and inter-modal
alignment. To counteract this, CCA further leverages CLIP's inherent
cross-modal alignment by enhancing it in two ways: unidirectionally, through
fine-tuning a CLIP-based text classifier, and bidirectionally, via a
cross-attention mechanism that enriches visual and textual representations
through mutual interaction. Both unimodal and cross-modal classification
outputs can be effectively combined linearly to improve classification
accuracy. Extensive experiments on 11 benchmark datasets demonstrate that our
method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art approaches in terms of
few-shot performance and robustness to distributional shifts, while maintaining
computational efficiency. Code will be available at

Motivation: 现有方法在几何精度与鲁棒性之间存在权衡，显式方法精度高但难以处理模糊区域，隐式方法鲁棒性强但收敛慢。

Method: H3R整合了体积潜在融合和基于注意力的特征聚合，包括几何一致的潜在体积和相机感知的Transformer。

Result: 在多个基准测试中达到SOTA性能，PSNR提升显著（如RealEstate10K提升0.59 dB）。

Conclusion: H3R通过混合框架解决了多视角3D重建的挑战，支持高分辨率输入并实现跨数据集泛化。

Abstract: Despite recent advances in feed-forward 3D Gaussian Splatting, generalizable
3D reconstruction remains challenging, particularly in multi-view
correspondence modeling. Existing approaches face a fundamental trade-off:
explicit methods achieve geometric precision but struggle with ambiguous
regions, while implicit methods provide robustness but suffer from slow
convergence. We present H3R, a hybrid framework that addresses this limitation
by integrating volumetric latent fusion with attention-based feature
aggregation. Our framework consists of two complementary components: an
efficient latent volume that enforces geometric consistency through epipolar
constraints, and a camera-aware Transformer that leverages Pl\"ucker
coordinates for adaptive correspondence refinement. By integrating both
paradigms, our approach enhances generalization while converging 2$\times$
faster than existing methods. Furthermore, we show that spatial-aligned
foundation models (e.g., SD-VAE) substantially outperform semantic-aligned
models (e.g., DINOv2), resolving the mismatch between semantic representations
and spatial reconstruction requirements. Our method supports variable-number
and high-resolution input views while demonstrating robust cross-dataset
generalization. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks, with significant PSNR
improvements of 0.59 dB, 1.06 dB, and 0.22 dB on the RealEstate10K, ACID, and
DTU datasets, respectively. Code is available at

Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) that enable natural language interaction with
satellite imagery can democratize Earth observation by accelerating expert
workflows, making data accessible to non-specialists, and enabling planet-scale
automation. However, existing datasets focus mainly on short-term,
high-resolution imagery from a limited number of satellites, overlooking
low-resolution, multi-satellite, long-term archives, such as Landsat, that are
essential for affordable and bias-robust global monitoring. We address this gap
with Landsat30-AU, a large-scale vision-language dataset built from 30-meter
resolution imagery collected by four Landsat satellites (5, 7, 8, and 9) over
Australia, spanning more than 36 years. The dataset includes two components:
Landsat30-AU-Cap, containing 196,262 image-caption pairs, and Landsat30-AU-VQA,
comprising 17,725 human-verified visual question answering (VQA) samples across
eight remote sensing domains. Both datasets are curated through a bootstrapped
pipeline that leverages generic VLMs with iterative refinement and human
verification to ensure quality. Our evaluation of eight VLMs on our benchmark
reveals that off-the-shelf models struggle to understand satellite imagery. The
open-source remote-sensing VLM EarthDial achieves only 0.07 SPIDEr in
captioning and a VQA accuracy of 0.48, highlighting the limitations of current
approaches. Encouragingly, lightweight fine-tuning of Qwen2.5-VL-7B on
Landsat30-AU improves captioning performance from 0.11 to 0.31 SPIDEr and
boosts VQA accuracy from \textbf{0.74} to 0.87. Code and data are available at

Abstract: The accurate state estimation of unknown bodies in space is a critical
challenge with applications ranging from the tracking of space debris to the
shape estimation of small bodies. A necessary enabler to this capability is to
find and track features on a continuous stream of images. Existing methods,
such as SIFT, ORB and AKAZE, achieve real-time but inaccurate pose estimates,
whereas modern deep learning methods yield higher quality features at the cost
of more demanding computational resources which might not be available on
space-qualified hardware. Additionally, both classical and data-driven methods
are not robust to the highly opaque self-cast shadows on the object of
interest. We show that, as the target body rotates, these shadows may lead to
large biases in the resulting pose estimates. For these objects, a bias in the
real-time pose estimation algorithm may mislead the spacecraft's state
estimator and cause a mission failure, especially if the body undergoes a
chaotic tumbling motion. We present COFFEE, the Celestial Occlusion Fast
FEature Extractor, a real-time pose estimation framework for asteroids designed
to leverage prior information on the sun phase angle given by sun-tracking
sensors commonly available onboard spacecraft. By associating salient contours
to their projected shadows, a sparse set of features are detected, invariant to
the motion of the shadows. A Sparse Neural Network followed by an
attention-based Graph Neural Network feature matching model are then jointly
trained to provide a set of correspondences between successive frames. The
resulting pose estimation pipeline is found to be bias-free, more accurate than
classical pose estimation pipelines and an order of magnitude faster than other
state-of-the-art deep learning pipelines on synthetic data as well as on
renderings of the tumbling asteroid Apophis.

Abstract: Fire scene datasets are crucial for training robust computer vision models,
particularly in tasks such as fire early warning and emergency rescue
operations. However, among the currently available fire-related data, there is
a significant shortage of annotated data specifically targeting building
units.To tackle this issue, we introduce an annotated dataset of building units
captured by drones, which incorporates multiple enhancement techniques. We
construct backgrounds using real multi-story scenes, combine motion blur and
brightness adjustment to enhance the authenticity of the captured images,
simulate drone shooting conditions under various circumstances, and employ
large models to generate fire effects at different locations.The synthetic
dataset generated by this method encompasses a wide range of building
scenarios, with a total of 1,978 images. This dataset can effectively improve
the generalization ability of fire unit detection, providing multi-scenario and
scalable data while reducing the risks and costs associated with collecting
real fire data. The dataset is available at

Conclusion: UniEdit-I为统一VLM提供了一种无需训练的高保真图像编辑解决方案，展示了未来发展的潜力。

Abstract: In recent years, unified vision-language models (VLMs) have rapidly advanced,
effectively tackling both visual understanding and generation tasks within a
single design. While many unified VLMs have explored various design choices,
the recent hypothesis from OpenAI's GPT-4o suggests a promising generation
pipeline: Understanding VLM->Visual Feature->Projector->Diffusion Model->Image.
The understanding VLM is frozen, and only the generation-related modules are
trained. This pipeline maintains the strong capability of understanding VLM
while enabling the image generation ability of the unified VLM. Although this
pipeline has shown very promising potential for the future development of
unified VLM, how to easily enable image editing capability is still unexplored.
In this paper, we introduce a novel training-free framework named UniEdit-I to
enable the unified VLM with image editing capability via three iterative steps:
understanding, editing, and verifying. 1. The understanding step analyzes the
source image to create a source prompt through structured semantic analysis and
makes minimal word replacements to form the target prompt based on the editing
instruction. 2. The editing step introduces a time-adaptive offset, allowing
for coherent editing from coarse to fine throughout the denoising process. 3.
The verification step checks the alignment between the target prompt and the
intermediate edited image, provides automatic consistency scores and corrective
feedback, and determines whether to stop early or continue the editing loop.
This understanding, editing, and verifying loop iterates until convergence,
delivering high-fidelity editing in a training-free manner. We implemented our
method based on the latest BLIP3-o and achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA)
performance on the GEdit-Bench benchmark.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散方法在空间可控性和区域保真度方面表现不足，需要改进以增强工业异常检测系统的鲁棒性。

Method: 提出SARD框架，结合区域约束扩散（RCD）和判别性掩码引导（DMG），选择性更新异常区域并评估全局和局部保真度。

Result: 在MVTec-AD和BTAD数据集上，SARD在分割精度和视觉质量上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SARD为像素级异常合成设定了新的技术标杆。

Abstract: Synthesizing realistic and spatially precise anomalies is essential for
enhancing the robustness of industrial anomaly detection systems. While recent
diffusion-based methods have demonstrated strong capabilities in modeling
complex defect patterns, they often struggle with spatial controllability and
fail to maintain fine-grained regional fidelity. To overcome these limitations,
we propose SARD (Segmentation-Aware anomaly synthesis via Region-constrained
Diffusion with discriminative mask Guidance), a novel diffusion-based framework
specifically designed for anomaly generation. Our approach introduces a
Region-Constrained Diffusion (RCD) process that preserves the background by
freezing it and selectively updating only the foreground anomaly regions during
the reverse denoising phase, thereby effectively reducing background artifacts.
Additionally, we incorporate a Discriminative Mask Guidance (DMG) module into
the discriminator, enabling joint evaluation of both global realism and local
anomaly fidelity, guided by pixel-level masks. Extensive experiments on the
MVTec-AD and BTAD datasets show that SARD surpasses existing methods in
segmentation accuracy and visual quality, setting a new state-of-the-art for
pixel-level anomaly synthesis.

Conclusion: LORE通过潜在空间优化实现了高效、通用的图像编辑，展示了其有效性和可扩展性。

Abstract: Text-driven image editing enables users to flexibly modify visual content
through natural language instructions, and is widely applied to tasks such as
semantic object replacement, insertion, and removal. While recent
inversion-based editing methods using rectified flow models have achieved
promising results in image quality, we identify a structural limitation in
their editing behavior: the semantic bias toward the source concept encoded in
the inverted noise tends to suppress attention to the target concept. This
issue becomes particularly critical when the source and target semantics are
dissimilar, where the attention mechanism inherently leads to editing failure
or unintended modifications in non-target regions. In this paper, we
systematically analyze and validate this structural flaw, and introduce LORE, a
training-free and efficient image editing method. LORE directly optimizes the
inverted noise, addressing the core limitations in generalization and
controllability of existing approaches, enabling stable, controllable, and
general-purpose concept replacement, without requiring architectural
modification or model fine-tuning. We conduct comprehensive evaluations on
three challenging benchmarks: PIEBench, SmartEdit, and GapEdit. Experimental
results show that LORE significantly outperforms strong baselines in terms of
semantic alignment, image quality, and background fidelity, demonstrating the
effectiveness and scalability of latent-space optimization for general-purpose
image editing.

Result: 实验表明，基于ChartCap微调的模型生成的描述更准确、信息丰富且幻觉减少，优于开源、专有模型及人工标注。

Conclusion: ChartCap数据集和Visual Consistency Score为图表描述任务提供了高质量解决方案。

Abstract: Generating accurate, informative, and hallucination-free captions for charts
remains challenging for vision language models, primarily due to the lack of
large-scale, high-quality datasets of real-world charts. However, existing
real-world chart datasets suffer from the inclusion of extraneous information
that cannot be inferred from the chart and failure to sufficiently capture
structural elements and key insights. Therefore, we introduce ChartCap, a
large-scale dataset of 565K real-world chart images paired with type-specific,
dense captions that exclude extraneous information and highlight both
structural elements and key insights in detail. To build ChartCap, we design a
four-stage pipeline that generates captions using only the discernible data
from the chart and employ a cycle consistency-based human verification, which
accelerates quality control without sacrificing accuracy. Additionally, we
propose a novel metric, the Visual Consistency Score, which evaluates caption
quality by measuring the similarity between the chart regenerated from a
caption and the original chart, independent of reference captions. Extensive
experiments confirms that models fine-tuned on ChartCap consistently generate
more accurate and informative captions with reduced hallucinations, surpassing
both open-source and proprietary models and even human-annotated captions.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LVLMs在复杂视觉-文本理解上取得突破，但幻觉问题限制了其实际应用，尤其是风格化图像在关键场景中的潜在风险。

Method: 构建了包含摄影图像和风格化版本的数据集，并比较了13种先进LVLMs的表现，提出SAVER机制动态调整输出。

Result: 风格化图像比摄影图像更容易引发幻觉，SAVER在多种模型和任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: SAVER有效缓解了风格化图像引发的幻觉问题，提升了LVLMs的实用性。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) recently achieve significant
breakthroughs in understanding complex visual-textual contexts. However,
hallucination issues still limit their real-world applicability. Although
previous mitigation methods effectively reduce hallucinations in photographic
images, they largely overlook the potential risks posed by stylized images,
which play crucial roles in critical scenarios such as game scene
understanding, art education, and medical analysis. In this work, we first
construct a dataset comprising photographic images and their corresponding
stylized versions with carefully annotated caption labels. We then conduct
head-to-head comparisons on both discriminative and generative tasks by
benchmarking 13 advanced LVLMs on the collected datasets. Our findings reveal
that stylized images tend to induce significantly more hallucinations than
their photographic counterparts. To address this issue, we propose Style-Aware
Visual Early Revision SAVER, a novel mechanism that dynamically adjusts LVLMs'
final outputs based on the token-level visual attention patterns, leveraging
early-layer feedback to mitigate hallucinations caused by stylized images.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that SAVER achieves state-of-the-art
performance in hallucination mitigation across various models, datasets, and
tasks.

Motivation: 现有3D高斯渲染方法依赖计算密集的顺序alpha混合操作，导致资源受限平台上的性能瓶颈。

Method: 采用代理高斯表示和单元搜索光栅化技术，结合顺序无关透明度（OIT）实现高效渲染。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在多种场景下表现稳健，速度提升1.5至4倍，排序开销减少52.2%至86.9%。

Conclusion: Duplex-GS通过OIT渲染范式显著提升了高斯渲染的效率和质量，适用于多尺度和大规模环境。

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have demonstrated remarkable
rendering fidelity and efficiency. However, these methods still rely on
computationally expensive sequential alpha-blending operations, resulting in
significant overhead, particularly on resource-constrained platforms. In this
paper, we propose Duplex-GS, a dual-hierarchy framework that integrates proxy
Gaussian representations with order-independent rendering techniques to achieve
photorealistic results while sustaining real-time performance. To mitigate the
overhead caused by view-adaptive radix sort, we introduce cell proxies for
local Gaussians management and propose cell search rasterization for further
acceleration. By seamlessly combining our framework with Order-Independent
Transparency (OIT), we develop a physically inspired weighted sum rendering
technique that simultaneously eliminates "popping" and "transparency"
artifacts, yielding substantial improvements in both accuracy and efficiency.
Extensive experiments on a variety of real-world datasets demonstrate the
robustness of our method across diverse scenarios, including multi-scale
training views and large-scale environments. Our results validate the
advantages of the OIT rendering paradigm in Gaussian Splatting, achieving
high-quality rendering with an impressive 1.5 to 4 speedup over existing OIT
based Gaussian Splatting approaches and 52.2% to 86.9% reduction of the radix
sort overhead without quality degradation.

Motivation: 单目深度估计因3D结构恢复的固有模糊性而具有挑战性，需结合多尺度信息。

Method: 使用GLKAM模块捕捉多尺度局部结构，GBPM模块预测全局深度分布。

Result: 在NYU-V2和KITTI数据集上表现优异，超越现有方法。

Conclusion: 提出的模块有效提升了深度估计的准确性。

Abstract: Accurate monocular depth estimation remains a challenging problem due to the
inherent ambiguity that stems from the ill-posed nature of recovering 3D
structure from a single view, where multiple plausible depth configurations can
produce identical 2D projections. In this paper, we present a novel depth
estimation method that combines both local and global cues to improve
prediction accuracy. Specifically, we propose the Gated Large Kernel Attention
Module (GLKAM) to effectively capture multi-scale local structural information
by leveraging large kernel convolutions with a gated mechanism. To further
enhance the global perception of the network, we introduce the Global Bin
Prediction Module (GBPM), which estimates the global distribution of depth bins
and provides structural guidance for depth regression. Extensive experiments on
the NYU-V2 and KITTI dataset demonstrate that our method achieves competitive
performance and outperforms existing approaches, validating the effectiveness
of each proposed component.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于KAN的持续人脸伪造检测框架（KAN-CFD），通过Domain-Group KAN Detector（DG-KD）和Feature Separation策略（FS-KDCP）解决KAN在高维图像建模和特征重叠中的局限性，显著减少了遗忘现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人脸伪造技术的快速发展要求检测器持续适应新方法，但现有方法在学习新伪造类型时会出现灾难性遗忘问题。KAN因其局部可塑性适合解决这一问题，但在高维图像建模和特征重叠方面存在局限性。

Method: 提出KAN-CFD框架，包括DG-KD和FS-KDCP。DG-KD使KAN适应高维图像输入并保持局部可塑性；FS-KDCP通过KAN漂移补偿投影避免输入空间重叠，无需使用先前任务的数据。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在减少遗忘的同时实现了优异的性能。

Conclusion: KAN-CFD通过结合DG-KD和FS-KDCP，有效解决了KAN在持续学习中的局限性，为人脸伪造检测提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: The rapid advancements in face forgery techniques necessitate that detectors
continuously adapt to new forgery methods, thus situating face forgery
detection within a continual learning paradigm. However, when detectors learn
new forgery types, their performance on previous types often degrades rapidly,
a phenomenon known as catastrophic forgetting. Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks
(KANs) utilize locally plastic splines as their activation functions, enabling
them to learn new tasks by modifying only local regions of the functions while
leaving other areas unaffected. Therefore, they are naturally suitable for
addressing catastrophic forgetting. However, KANs have two significant
limitations: 1) the splines are ineffective for modeling high-dimensional
images, while alternative activation functions that are suitable for images
lack the essential property of locality; 2) in continual learning, when
features from different domains overlap, the mapping of different domains to
distinct curve regions always collapses due to repeated modifications of the
same regions. In this paper, we propose a KAN-based Continual Face Forgery
Detection (KAN-CFD) framework, which includes a Domain-Group KAN Detector
(DG-KD) and a data-free replay Feature Separation strategy via KAN Drift
Compensation Projection (FS-KDCP). DG-KD enables KANs to fit high-dimensional
image inputs while preserving locality and local plasticity. FS-KDCP avoids the
overlap of the KAN input spaces without using data from prior tasks.
Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior
performance while notably reducing forgetting.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 湿性年龄相关性黄斑变性（wet AMD）是全球致盲的主要原因，而脉络膜新生血管（CNV）是其典型特征。OCTA图像的分割对临床评估至关重要，但现有方法面临CNV形状不规则、成像限制及数据集缺乏等挑战。

Method: MTG-Net结合区域和血管形态信息，通过多任务框架和图机制（MIGR和MRGR）优化分割。提出不确定性加权损失以减少噪声影响。

Result: 实验结果显示，MTG-Net在区域分割和血管分割上的Dice分数分别达到87.21%和88.12%，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MTG-Net通过多任务和图机制有效提升了CNV分割的准确性，为wet AMD的临床评估提供了新工具。

Abstract: Choroidal neovascularization (CNV), a primary characteristic of wet
age-related macular degeneration (wet AMD), represents a leading cause of
blindness worldwide. In clinical practice, optical coherence tomography
angiography (OCTA) is commonly used for studying CNV-related pathological
changes, due to its micron-level resolution and non-invasive nature. Thus,
accurate segmentation of CNV regions and vessels in OCTA images is crucial for
clinical assessment of wet AMD. However, challenges existed due to irregular
CNV shapes and imaging limitations like projection artifacts, noises and
boundary blurring. Moreover, the lack of publicly available datasets
constraints the CNV analysis. To address these challenges, this paper
constructs the first publicly accessible CNV dataset (CNVSeg), and proposes a
novel multilateral graph convolutional interaction-enhanced CNV segmentation
network (MTG-Net). This network integrates both region and vessel morphological
information, exploring semantic and geometric duality constraints within the
graph domain. Specifically, MTG-Net consists of a multi-task framework and two
graph-based cross-task modules: Multilateral Interaction Graph Reasoning (MIGR)
and Multilateral Reinforcement Graph Reasoning (MRGR). The multi-task framework
encodes rich geometric features of lesion shapes and surfaces, decoupling the
image into three task-specific feature maps. MIGR and MRGR iteratively reason
about higher-order relationships across tasks through a graph mechanism,
enabling complementary optimization for task-specific objectives. Additionally,
an uncertainty-weighted loss is proposed to mitigate the impact of artifacts
and noise on segmentation accuracy. Experimental results demonstrate that
MTG-Net outperforms existing methods, achieving a Dice socre of 87.21\% for
region segmentation and 88.12\% for vessel segmentation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在区分文本表达的细微语义差异方面存在不足，主要由于类别和属性模糊性。

Method: 提出AlignCAT框架，包含粗粒度对齐模块（利用类别信息和全局上下文）和细粒度对齐模块（利用描述性信息和词级文本特征）。

Result: 在RefCOCO、RefCOCO+和RefCOCOg三个基准测试中表现优于现有弱监督方法。

Conclusion: AlignCAT通过充分利用语言线索，有效提升了视觉定位的性能。

Abstract: Weakly supervised visual grounding (VG) aims to locate objects in images
based on text descriptions. Despite significant progress, existing methods lack
strong cross-modal reasoning to distinguish subtle semantic differences in text
expressions due to category-based and attribute-based ambiguity. To address
these challenges, we introduce AlignCAT, a novel query-based semantic matching
framework for weakly supervised VG. To enhance visual-linguistic alignment, we
propose a coarse-grained alignment module that utilizes category information
and global context, effectively mitigating interference from
category-inconsistent objects. Subsequently, a fine-grained alignment module
leverages descriptive information and captures word-level text features to
achieve attribute consistency. By exploiting linguistic cues to their fullest
extent, our proposed AlignCAT progressively filters out misaligned visual
queries and enhances contrastive learning efficiency. Extensive experiments on
three VG benchmarks, namely RefCOCO, RefCOCO+, and RefCOCOg, verify the
superiority of AlignCAT against existing weakly supervised methods on two VG
tasks. Our code is available at: https://github.com/I2-Multimedia-Lab/AlignCAT.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖视觉语言模型，但图像级预训练与细粒度区域级交互检测不匹配，且文本描述编码效果不佳。

Method: 提出交互感知提示生成器和语言模型引导的概念校准，结合负采样策略优化跨模态相似性建模。

Result: 在SWIG-HOI和HICO-DET数据集上显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: INP-CC通过动态提示和概念校准有效提升了开放词汇HOI检测性能。

Abstract: Open Vocabulary Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection aims to detect
interactions between humans and objects while generalizing to novel interaction
classes beyond the training set. Current methods often rely on Vision and
Language Models (VLMs) but face challenges due to suboptimal image encoders, as
image-level pre-training does not align well with the fine-grained region-level
interaction detection required for HOI. Additionally, effectively encoding
textual descriptions of visual appearances remains difficult, limiting the
model's ability to capture detailed HOI relationships. To address these issues,
we propose INteraction-aware Prompting with Concept Calibration (INP-CC), an
end-to-end open-vocabulary HOI detector that integrates interaction-aware
prompts and concept calibration. Specifically, we propose an interaction-aware
prompt generator that dynamically generates a compact set of prompts based on
the input scene, enabling selective sharing among similar interactions. This
approach directs the model's attention to key interaction patterns rather than
generic image-level semantics, enhancing HOI detection. Furthermore, we refine
HOI concept representations through language model-guided calibration, which
helps distinguish diverse HOI concepts by investigating visual similarities
across categories. A negative sampling strategy is also employed to improve
inter-modal similarity modeling, enabling the model to better differentiate
visually similar but semantically distinct actions. Extensive experimental
results demonstrate that INP-CC significantly outperforms state-of-the-art
models on the SWIG-HOI and HICO-DET datasets. Code is available at

Motivation: 现有的对抗性扰动方法在高分辨率图像和低扰动预算下表现不佳，且可能引入无关语义内容，无法有效保护地理隐私。

Method: GeoShield包含三个模块：特征解耦模块分离地理和非地理信息，暴露元素识别模块定位图像中的地理暴露区域，尺度自适应增强模块联合优化全局和局部扰动。

Result: 在挑战性基准测试中，GeoShield在黑盒设置下显著优于现有方法，实现了强隐私保护且对视觉或语义质量影响最小。

Conclusion: GeoShield是首个探索对抗性扰动防御高级VLM地理推断的研究，为解决日益增长的隐私问题提供了实用有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) such as GPT-4o now demonstrate a remarkable
ability to infer users' locations from public shared images, posing a
substantial risk to geoprivacy. Although adversarial perturbations offer a
potential defense, current methods are ill-suited for this scenario: they often
perform poorly on high-resolution images and low perturbation budgets, and may
introduce irrelevant semantic content. To address these limitations, we propose
GeoShield, a novel adversarial framework designed for robust geoprivacy
protection in real-world scenarios. GeoShield comprises three key modules: a
feature disentanglement module that separates geographical and non-geographical
information, an exposure element identification module that pinpoints
geo-revealing regions within an image, and a scale-adaptive enhancement module
that jointly optimizes perturbations at both global and local levels to ensure
effectiveness across resolutions. Extensive experiments on challenging
benchmarks show that GeoShield consistently surpasses prior methods in
black-box settings, achieving strong privacy protection with minimal impact on
visual or semantic quality. To our knowledge, this work is the first to explore
adversarial perturbations for defending against geolocation inference by
advanced VLMs, providing a practical and effective solution to escalating
privacy concerns.

TL;DR: FastInit提出了一种快速的噪声初始化方法，避免了迭代优化，通过单次前向传播生成高质量视频。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（如FreeInit）需要迭代优化噪声，计算成本高，FastInit旨在解决这一问题。

Method: FastInit通过训练一个视频噪声预测网络（VNPNet），输入随机噪声和文本提示，单次生成优化后的噪声。

Result: 实验表明，FastInit显著提高了视频生成的质量和时间一致性，且计算效率更高。

Conclusion: FastInit为视频生成提供了一种高效且实用的解决方案，可直接应用于推理阶段。

Abstract: Video generation has made significant strides with the development of
diffusion models; however, achieving high temporal consistency remains a
challenging task. Recently, FreeInit identified a training-inference gap and
introduced a method to iteratively refine the initial noise during inference.
However, iterative refinement significantly increases the computational cost
associated with video generation. In this paper, we introduce FastInit, a fast
noise initialization method that eliminates the need for iterative refinement.
FastInit learns a Video Noise Prediction Network (VNPNet) that takes random
noise and a text prompt as input, generating refined noise in a single forward
pass. Therefore, FastInit greatly enhances the efficiency of video generation
while achieving high temporal consistency across frames. To train the VNPNet,
we create a large-scale dataset consisting of pairs of text prompts, random
noise, and refined noise. Extensive experiments with various text-to-video
models show that our method consistently improves the quality and temporal
consistency of the generated videos. FastInit not only provides a substantial
improvement in video generation but also offers a practical solution that can
be applied directly during inference. The code and dataset will be released.

Conclusion: UAA为构建鲁棒模型提供了一种实用且高效的途径，代码已公开。

Abstract: Adversarial perturbations pose a significant threat to deep learning models.
Adversarial Training (AT), the predominant defense method, faces challenges of
high computational costs and a degradation in standard performance. While data
augmentation offers an alternative path, existing techniques either yield
limited robustness gains or incur substantial training overhead. Therefore,
developing a defense mechanism that is both highly efficient and strongly
robust is of paramount importance.In this work, we first conduct a systematic
analysis of existing augmentation techniques, revealing that the synergy among
diverse strategies -- rather than any single method -- is crucial for enhancing
robustness. Based on this insight, we propose the Universal Adversarial
Augmenter (UAA) framework, which is characterized by its plug-and-play nature
and training efficiency. UAA decouples the expensive perturbation generation
process from model training by pre-computing a universal transformation
offline, which is then used to efficiently generate unique adversarial
perturbations for each sample during training.Extensive experiments conducted
on multiple benchmarks validate the effectiveness of UAA. The results
demonstrate that UAA establishes a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) for
data-augmentation-based adversarial defense strategies , without requiring the
online generation of adversarial examples during training. This framework
provides a practical and efficient pathway for building robust models,Our code
is available in the supplementary materials.

Conclusion: ActionSink通过动作流和动态集成机制显著提升了机器人操作的精确性，为学习型机器人操作提供了新思路。

Abstract: Language-instructed robot manipulation has garnered significant interest due
to the potential of learning from collected data. While the challenges in
high-level perception and planning are continually addressed along the progress
of general large pre-trained models, the low precision of low-level action
estimation has emerged as the key limiting factor in manipulation performance.
To this end, this paper introduces a novel robot manipulation framework, i.e.,
ActionSink, to pave the way toward precise action estimations in the field of
learning-based robot manipulation. As the name suggests, ActionSink
reformulates the actions of robots as action-caused optical flows from videos,
called "action flow", in a self-supervised manner, which are then used to be
retrieved and integrated to enhance the action estimation. Specifically,
ActionSink incorporates two primary modules. The first module is a
coarse-to-fine action flow matcher, which continuously refines the accuracy of
action flow via iterative retrieval and denoising process. The second module is
a dynamic action flow integrator, which employs a working memory pool that
dynamically and efficiently manages the historical action flows that should be
used to integrate to enhance the current action estimation. In this module, a
multi-layer fusion module is proposed to integrate direct estimation and action
flows from both the current and the working memory, achieving highly accurate
action estimation through a series of estimation-integration processes. Our
ActionSink framework outperformed prior SOTA on the LIBERO benchmark by a 7.9\%
success rate, and obtained nearly an 8\% accuracy gain on the challenging
long-horizon visual task LIBERO-Long.

Conclusion: GIT为3D分割提供了更清晰和一致的边界，支持分层分割、对象提取和场景编辑等应用。

Abstract: We address the challenge of lifting 2D visual segmentation to 3D in Gaussian
Splatting. Existing methods often suffer from inconsistent 2D masks across
viewpoints and produce noisy segmentation boundaries as they neglect these
semantic cues to refine the learned Gaussians. To overcome this, we introduce
Gaussian Instance Tracing (GIT), which augments the standard Gaussian
representation with an instance weight matrix across input views. Leveraging
the inherent consistency of Gaussians in 3D, we use this matrix to identify and
correct 2D segmentation inconsistencies. Furthermore, since each Gaussian
ideally corresponds to a single object, we propose a GIT-guided adaptive
density control mechanism to split and prune ambiguous Gaussians during
training, resulting in sharper and more coherent 2D and 3D segmentation
boundaries. Experimental results show that our method extracts clean 3D assets
and consistently improves 3D segmentation in both online (e.g., self-prompting)
and offline (e.g., contrastive lifting) settings, enabling applications such as
hierarchical segmentation, object extraction, and scene editing.

pipeline that leverages two vision foundation models: the Segment Anything
Model (SAM) for object segmentation and DINOv2 for feature embedding. By
combining these models with a lightweight classifier, we achieve high-precision
shape classification across three morphologically diverse nanoparticle datasets
- without the need for extensive parameter fine-tuning. Our methodology
outperforms a fine-tuned YOLOv11 and ChatGPT o4-mini-high baselines,
demonstrating robustness to small datasets, subtle morphological variations,
and domain shifts from natural to scientific imaging. Quantitative clustering
metrics on PCA plots of the DINOv2 features are discussed as a means of
assessing the progress of the chemical synthesis. This work highlights the
potential of foundation models to advance automated microscopy image analysis,
offering an alternative to traditional deep learning pipelines in nanoparticle
research which is both more efficient and more accessible to the user.

TL;DR: 论文提出了FFHQ-Makeup数据集，解决了高质量成对素颜-化妆图像数据集的缺乏问题，通过改进的化妆迁移方法生成18K身份的90K图像对。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有合成方法在真实性和一致性上存在不足，且缺乏高质量成对数据集，限制了美容相关任务的研究。

Method: 基于FFHQ数据集，采用改进的化妆迁移方法，将真实化妆风格迁移到18K身份上，生成5种化妆风格的90K图像对。

Result: 构建了FFHQ-Makeup数据集，包含高质量且保持身份和表情一致性的成对图像。

Conclusion: FFHQ-Makeup填补了高质量成对数据集的空白，为美容相关任务提供了宝贵资源。

Abstract: Paired bare-makeup facial images are essential for a wide range of
beauty-related tasks, such as virtual try-on, facial privacy protection, and
facial aesthetics analysis. However, collecting high-quality paired makeup
datasets remains a significant challenge. Real-world data acquisition is
constrained by the difficulty of collecting large-scale paired images, while
existing synthetic approaches often suffer from limited realism or
inconsistencies between bare and makeup images. Current synthetic methods
typically fall into two categories: warping-based transformations, which often
distort facial geometry and compromise the precision of makeup; and
text-to-image generation, which tends to alter facial identity and expression,
undermining consistency. In this work, we present FFHQ-Makeup, a high-quality
synthetic makeup dataset that pairs each identity with multiple makeup styles
while preserving facial consistency in both identity and expression. Built upon
the diverse FFHQ dataset, our pipeline transfers real-world makeup styles from
existing datasets onto 18K identities by introducing an improved makeup
transfer method that disentangles identity and makeup. Each identity is paired
with 5 different makeup styles, resulting in a total of 90K high-quality
bare-makeup image pairs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work
that focuses specifically on constructing a makeup dataset. We hope that
FFHQ-Makeup fills the gap of lacking high-quality bare-makeup paired datasets
and serves as a valuable resource for future research in beauty-related tasks.

*Lukas Ranftl,Felix Brendel,Bertram Drost,Carsten Steger*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MVTOP是一种基于Transformer的多视角刚性物体姿态估计方法，通过早期融合视角特征解决单视角无法解决的姿态模糊问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决单视角或多视角后处理无法解决的姿态模糊问题，提出一种更可靠的多视角方法。

Method: 利用视线从相机中心出发的多视角几何建模，假设相机内参和相对方向已知但可变化。

Result: 在合成数据集和YCB-V数据集上优于单视角和其他多视角方法。

Conclusion: MVTOP是一种端到端可训练的多视角方法，无需额外数据，能可靠解决姿态模糊问题。

Abstract: We present MVTOP, a novel transformer-based method for multi-view rigid
object pose estimation. Through an early fusion of the view-specific features,
our method can resolve pose ambiguities that would be impossible to solve with
a single view or with a post-processing of single-view poses. MVTOP models the
multi-view geometry via lines of sight that emanate from the respective camera
centers. While the method assumes the camera interior and relative orientations
are known for a particular scene, they can vary for each inference. This makes
the method versatile. The use of the lines of sight enables MVTOP to correctly
predict the correct pose with the merged multi-view information. To show the
model's capabilities, we provide a synthetic data set that can only be solved
with such holistic multi-view approaches since the poses in the dataset cannot
be solved with just one view. Our method outperforms single-view and all
existing multi-view approaches on our dataset and achieves competitive results
on the YCB-V dataset. To the best of our knowledge, no holistic multi-view
method exists that can resolve such pose ambiguities reliably. Our model is
end-to-end trainable and does not require any additional data, e.g., depth.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于脉冲神经网络的超轻量级事件超分辨率方法，适用于资源受限设备。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 事件相机的高时间分辨率、低延迟和高动态范围优势受限于其低空间分辨率，难以完成精细感知任务。

Method: 采用双向前极性分离事件编码策略和可学习的时空极性感知损失函数，优化模型大小和性能。

Result: 在多个数据集上实现了竞争性的超分辨率性能，同时显著减小了模型大小和推理时间。

Conclusion: 轻量级设计使其可嵌入事件相机或作为下游视觉任务的高效前端预处理模块。

Abstract: Event cameras offer unparalleled advantages such as high temporal resolution,
low latency, and high dynamic range. However, their limited spatial resolution
poses challenges for fine-grained perception tasks. In this work, we propose an
ultra-lightweight, stream-based event-to-event super-resolution method based on
Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), designed for real-time deployment on
resource-constrained devices. To further reduce model size, we introduce a
novel Dual-Forward Polarity-Split Event Encoding strategy that decouples
positive and negative events into separate forward paths through a shared SNN.
Furthermore, we propose a Learnable Spatio-temporal Polarity-aware Loss
(LearnSTPLoss) that adaptively balances temporal, spatial, and polarity
consistency using learnable uncertainty-based weights. Experimental results
demonstrate that our method achieves competitive super-resolution performance
on multiple datasets while significantly reducing model size and inference
time. The lightweight design enables embedding the module into event cameras or
using it as an efficient front-end preprocessing for downstream vision tasks.

TL;DR: RSDNet提出了一种基于DDPM的单阶段稀疏3D目标检测方法，通过可分离潜在框架（DLF）和多级去噪网络提高效率和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于DDPM的3D目标检测方法通常需要多步迭代推理，效率较低。

Method: RSDNet利用轻量级去噪网络（如多级DAEs）在潜在特征空间学习去噪过程，并引入语义-几何条件引导增强稀疏表示。

Result: 实验表明RSDNet在公共基准上优于现有方法，达到最先进的检测性能。

Conclusion: RSDNet通过单步推理和鲁棒设计，显著提高了3D目标检测的效率和性能。

Abstract: Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) have shown success in robust
3D object detection tasks. Existing methods often rely on the score matching
from 3D boxes or pre-trained diffusion priors. However, they typically require
multi-step iterations in inference, which limits efficiency. To address this,
we propose a \textbf{R}obust single-stage fully \textbf{S}parse 3D object
\textbf{D}etection \textbf{Net}work with a Detachable Latent Framework (DLF) of
DDPMs, named RSDNet. Specifically, RSDNet learns the denoising process in
latent feature spaces through lightweight denoising networks like multi-level
denoising autoencoders (DAEs). This enables RSDNet to effectively understand
scene distributions under multi-level perturbations, achieving robust and
reliable detection. Meanwhile, we reformulate the noising and denoising
mechanisms of DDPMs, enabling DLF to construct multi-type and multi-level noise
samples and targets, enhancing RSDNet robustness to multiple perturbations.
Furthermore, a semantic-geometric conditional guidance is introduced to
perceive the object boundaries and shapes, alleviating the center feature
missing problem in sparse representations, enabling RSDNet to perform in a
fully sparse detection pipeline. Moreover, the detachable denoising network
design of DLF enables RSDNet to perform single-step detection in inference,
further enhancing detection efficiency. Extensive experiments on public
benchmarks show that RSDNet can outperform existing methods, achieving
state-of-the-art detection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在资源受限环境中部署T2V模型时，降低计算成本同时保持性能是关键，现有蒸馏方法易导致模式崩溃。

Method: 结合DPO和SFT的ReDPO方法，以及V.I.P.框架筛选高质量数据集，分步在线训练。

Result: 在VideoCrafter2和AnimateDiff上分别减少36.2%和67.5%参数，性能保持或超越完整模型。

Conclusion: ReDPO和V.I.P.框架有效提升T2V模型的效率和生成质量。

Abstract: With growing interest in deploying text-to-video (T2V) models in
resource-constrained environments, reducing their high computational cost has
become crucial, leading to extensive research on pruning and knowledge
distillation methods while maintaining performance. However, existing
distillation methods primarily rely on supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which
often leads to mode collapse as pruned models with reduced capacity fail to
directly match the teacher's outputs, ultimately resulting in degraded quality.
To address this challenge, we propose an effective distillation method, ReDPO,
that integrates DPO and SFT. Our approach leverages DPO to guide the student
model to focus on recovering only the targeted properties, rather than
passively imitating the teacher, while also utilizing SFT to enhance overall
performance. We additionally propose V.I.P., a novel framework for filtering
and curating high-quality pair datasets, along with a step-by-step online
approach for calibrated training. We validate our method on two leading T2V
models, VideoCrafter2 and AnimateDiff, achieving parameter reduction of 36.2%
and 67.5% each, while maintaining or even surpassing the performance of full
models. Further experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of both ReDPO and
V.I.P. framework in enabling efficient and high-quality video generation. Our

TL;DR: DiffBrush是一种基于扩散的模型，用于手写文本行生成，通过内容解耦风格学习和多尺度内容学习，解决了风格模仿和内容准确性的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要关注孤立单词，而真实手写文本需要关注单词间关系（如垂直对齐和水平间距），因此生成整行文本更具挑战性和实用性。

Method: DiffBrush采用内容解耦风格学习（通过列和行掩码分离风格与内容）和多尺度内容学习（使用行和单词鉴别器确保全局一致性和局部准确性）。

Result: 实验表明，DiffBrush在生成高质量文本行方面表现优异，尤其在风格再现和内容保留方面。

Conclusion: DiffBrush为手写文本行生成提供了一种有效解决方案，解决了风格和内容建模的复杂问题。

Abstract: Existing handwritten text generation methods primarily focus on isolated
words. However, realistic handwritten text demands attention not only to
individual words but also to the relationships between them, such as vertical
alignment and horizontal spacing. Therefore, generating entire text lines
emerges as a more promising and comprehensive task. However, this task poses
significant challenges, including the accurate modeling of complex style
patterns encompassing both intra- and inter-word relationships, and maintaining
content accuracy across numerous characters. To address these challenges, we
propose DiffBrush, a novel diffusion-based model for handwritten text-line
generation. Unlike existing methods, DiffBrush excels in both style imitation
and content accuracy through two key strategies: (1) content-decoupled style
learning, which disentangles style from content to better capture intra-word
and inter-word style patterns by using column- and row-wise masking; and (2)
multi-scale content learning, which employs line and word discriminators to
ensure global coherence and local accuracy of textual content. Extensive
experiments show that DiffBrush excels in generating high-quality text lines,
particularly in style reproduction and content preservation. Code is available

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将动词和名词组件视为独立分类任务，忽略了它们的语义和上下文关系，导致表示碎片化和泛化能力不足。

Method: 构建统一提示池空间，通过提示对形式分解组件表示，利用注意力机制融合模式级表示，并引入多样化池标准训练目标。

Result: 在Ego4D、EPIC-Kitchens和EGTEA数据集上，EgoPrompt在多种基准测试中达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: EgoPrompt通过增强组件间交互和多样化提示池，显著提升了第一人称动作识别的效果。

Abstract: Driven by the increasing demand for applications in augmented and virtual
reality, egocentric action recognition has emerged as a prominent research
area. It is typically divided into two subtasks: recognizing the performed
behavior (i.e., verb component) and identifying the objects being acted upon
(i.e., noun component) from the first-person perspective. However, most
existing approaches treat these two components as independent classification
tasks, focusing on extracting component-specific knowledge while overlooking
their inherent semantic and contextual relationships, leading to fragmented
representations and sub-optimal generalization capability. To address these
challenges, we propose a prompt learning-based framework, EgoPrompt, to conduct
the egocentric action recognition task. Building on the existing prompting
strategy to capture the component-specific knowledge, we construct a Unified
Prompt Pool space to establish interaction between the two types of component
representations. Specifically, the component representations (from verbs and
nouns) are first decomposed into fine-grained patterns with the prompt pair
form. Then, these pattern-level representations are fused through an
attention-based mechanism to facilitate cross-component interaction. To ensure
the prompt pool is informative, we further introduce a novel training
objective, Diverse Pool Criteria. This objective realizes our goals from two
perspectives: Prompt Selection Frequency Regularization and Prompt Knowledge
Orthogonalization. Extensive experiments are conducted on the Ego4D,
EPIC-Kitchens, and EGTEA datasets. The results consistently show that EgoPrompt
achieves state-of-the-art performance across within-dataset, cross-dataset, and
base-to-novel generalization benchmarks.

Conclusion: EmmPD框架在计算效率和诊断准确性上表现优异，为胎盘疾病预测提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate prediction of placental diseases via whole slide images (WSIs) is
critical for preventing severe maternal and fetal complications. However, WSI
analysis presents significant computational challenges due to the massive data
volume. Existing WSI classification methods encounter critical limitations: (1)
inadequate patch selection strategies that either compromise performance or
fail to sufficiently reduce computational demands, and (2) the loss of global
histological context resulting from patch-level processing approaches. To
address these challenges, we propose an Efficient multimodal framework for
Patient-level placental disease Diagnosis, named EmmPD. Our approach introduces
a two-stage patch selection module that combines parameter-free and learnable
compression strategies, optimally balancing computational efficiency with
critical feature preservation. Additionally, we develop a hybrid multimodal
fusion module that leverages adaptive graph learning to enhance pathological
feature representation and incorporates textual medical reports to enrich
global contextual understanding. Extensive experiments conducted on both a
self-constructed patient-level Placental dataset and two public datasets
demonstrating that our method achieves state-of-the-art diagnostic performance.

Conclusion: SDGPA通过合成数据和渐进适应策略有效解决了域自适应问题。

Abstract: Deep learning-based semantic segmentation models achieve impressive results
yet remain limited in handling distribution shifts between training and test
data. In this paper, we present SDGPA (Synthetic Data Generation and
Progressive Adaptation), a novel method that tackles zero-shot domain adaptive
semantic segmentation, in which no target images are available, but only a text
description of the target domain's style is provided. To compensate for the
lack of target domain training data, we utilize a pretrained off-the-shelf
text-to-image diffusion model, which generates training images by transferring
source domain images to target style. Directly editing source domain images
introduces noise that harms segmentation because the layout of source images
cannot be precisely maintained. To address inaccurate layouts in synthetic
data, we propose a method that crops the source image, edits small patches
individually, and then merges them back together, which helps improve spatial
precision. Recognizing the large domain gap, SDGPA constructs an augmented
intermediate domain, leveraging easier adaptation subtasks to enable more
stable model adaptation to the target domain. Additionally, to mitigate the
impact of noise in synthetic data, we design a progressive adaptation strategy,
ensuring robust learning throughout the training process. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in zero-shot
semantic segmentation. The code is available at

Result: 在公共基准数据集和真实记录中，BaroPoser优于仅使用IMU的现有方法。

Conclusion: BaroPoser通过结合气压数据，显著提升了不平坦地形上的姿态估计和全局平移预测能力。

Abstract: In recent years, tracking human motion using IMUs from everyday devices such
as smartphones and smartwatches has gained increasing popularity. However, due
to the sparsity of sensor measurements and the lack of datasets capturing human
motion over uneven terrain, existing methods often struggle with pose
estimation accuracy and are typically limited to recovering movements on flat
terrain only. To this end, we present BaroPoser, the first method that combines
IMU and barometric data recorded by a smartphone and a smartwatch to estimate
human pose and global translation in real time. By leveraging barometric
readings, we estimate sensor height changes, which provide valuable cues for
both improving the accuracy of human pose estimation and predicting global
translation on non-flat terrain. Furthermore, we propose a local thigh
coordinate frame to disentangle local and global motion input for better pose
representation learning. We evaluate our method on both public benchmark
datasets and real-world recordings. Quantitative and qualitative results
demonstrate that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods
that use IMUs only with the same hardware configuration.

Abstract: Object detection has achieved remarkable accuracy through deep learning, yet
these improvements often come with increased computational cost, limiting
deployment on resource-constrained devices. Knowledge Distillation (KD)
provides an effective solution by enabling compact student models to learn from
larger teacher models. However, adapting KD to object detection poses unique
challenges due to its dual objectives-classification and localization-as well
as foreground-background imbalance and multi-scale feature representation. This
review introduces a novel architecture-centric taxonomy for KD methods,
distinguishing between CNN-based detectors (covering backbone-level,
neck-level, head-level, and RPN/RoI-level distillation) and Transformer-based
detectors (including query-level, feature-level, and logit-level distillation).
We further evaluate representative methods using the MS COCO and PASCAL VOC
datasets with mAP@0.5 as performance metric, providing a comparative analysis
of their effectiveness. The proposed taxonomy and analysis aim to clarify the
evolving landscape of KD in object detection, highlight current challenges, and
guide future research toward efficient and scalable detection systems.

Abstract: We present a neuromorphic radar framework for real-time, low-power hand
gesture recognition (HGR) using an event-driven architecture inspired by
biological sensing. Our system comprises a 24 GHz Doppler radar front-end and a
custom neuromorphic sampler that converts intermediate-frequency (IF) signals
into sparse spike-based representations via asynchronous sigma-delta encoding.
These events are directly processed by a lightweight neural network deployed on
a Cortex-M0 microcontroller, enabling low-latency inference without requiring
spectrogram reconstruction. Unlike conventional radar HGR pipelines that
continuously sample and process data, our architecture activates only when
meaningful motion is detected, significantly reducing memory, power, and
computation overhead. Evaluated on a dataset of five gestures collected from
seven users, our system achieves > 85% real-time accuracy. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first work that employs bio-inspired asynchronous
sigma-delta encoding and an event-driven processing framework for radar-based
HGR.

Conclusion: LRDDv2为无人机检测研究提供了更全面的资源，尤其适用于长距离和小目标检测。

Abstract: The exponential growth in Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) usage underscores
the critical need of detecting them at extended distances to ensure safe
operations, especially in densely populated areas. Despite the tremendous
advances made in computer vision through deep learning, the detection of these
small airborne objects remains a formidable challenge. While several datasets
have been developed specifically for drone detection, the need for a more
extensive and diverse collection of drone image data persists, particularly for
long-range detection under varying environmental conditions. We introduce here
the Long Range Drone Detection (LRDD) Version 2 dataset, comprising 39,516
meticulously annotated images, as a second release of the LRDD dataset released
previously. The LRDDv2 dataset enhances the LRDDv1 by incorporating a greater
variety of images, providing a more diverse and comprehensive resource for
drone detection research. What sets LRDDv2 apart is its inclusion of target
range information for over 8,000 images, making it possible to develop

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于宏-微规划（MMPL）的长视频生成框架，解决了自回归扩散模型在长视频生成中的时间漂移和并行化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自回归扩散模型在长视频生成中因时间漂移和并行化限制表现不佳，需要一种新方法解决这些问题。

Method: 通过分层规划（微规划和宏规划）生成全局故事线，并基于内容填充并行生成中间帧，优化GPU执行。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在质量和稳定性上优于现有长视频生成模型。

Conclusion: MMPL框架有效解决了长视频生成中的时间漂移和并行化问题，提升了生成质量。

Abstract: Current autoregressive diffusion models excel at video generation but are
generally limited to short temporal durations. Our theoretical analysis
indicates that the autoregressive modeling typically suffers from temporal
drift caused by error accumulation and hinders parallelization in long video
synthesis. To address these limitations, we propose a novel
planning-then-populating framework centered on Macro-from-Micro Planning (MMPL)
for long video generation. MMPL sketches a global storyline for the entire
video through two hierarchical stages: Micro Planning and Macro Planning.
Specifically, Micro Planning predicts a sparse set of future keyframes within
each short video segment, offering motion and appearance priors to guide
high-quality video segment generation. Macro Planning extends the in-segment
keyframes planning across the entire video through an autoregressive chain of
micro plans, ensuring long-term consistency across video segments.
Subsequently, MMPL-based Content Populating generates all intermediate frames
in parallel across segments, enabling efficient parallelization of
autoregressive generation. The parallelization is further optimized by Adaptive
Workload Scheduling for balanced GPU execution and accelerated autoregressive
video generation. Extensive experiments confirm that our method outperforms
existing long video generation models in quality and stability. Generated
videos and comparison results are in our project page.

*Tongshun Zhang,Pingping Liu,Zixuan Zhong,Zijian Zhang,Qiuzhan Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种双阶段方法，通过残差傅里叶引导模块（RFGM）和Mamba模块，高效恢复极暗图像中的细节。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在恢复极暗图像细节时效果不佳，导致下游应用受限。

Method: 第一阶段使用RFGM恢复全局光照；第二阶段通过Patch Mamba和Grad Mamba细化纹理结构。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上显著提升细节恢复性能，且计算开销低。

Conclusion: 该方法轻量高效，可无缝集成到现有傅里叶框架中。

Abstract: Recovering fine-grained details in extremely dark images remains challenging
due to severe structural information loss and noise corruption. Existing
enhancement methods often fail to preserve intricate details and sharp edges,
limiting their effectiveness in downstream applications like text and edge
detection. To address these deficiencies, we propose an efficient dual-stage
approach centered on detail recovery for dark images. In the first stage, we
introduce a Residual Fourier-Guided Module (RFGM) that effectively restores
global illumination in the frequency domain. RFGM captures inter-stage and
inter-channel dependencies through residual connections, providing robust
priors for high-fidelity frequency processing while mitigating error
accumulation risks from unreliable priors. The second stage employs
complementary Mamba modules specifically designed for textural structure
refinement: (1) Patch Mamba operates on channel-concatenated non-downsampled
patches, meticulously modeling pixel-level correlations to enhance fine-grained
details without resolution loss. (2) Grad Mamba explicitly focuses on
high-gradient regions, alleviating state decay in state space models and
prioritizing reconstruction of sharp edges and boundaries. Extensive
experiments on multiple benchmark datasets and downstream applications
demonstrate that our method significantly improves detail recovery performance
while maintaining efficiency. Crucially, the proposed modules are lightweight
and can be seamlessly integrated into existing Fourier-based frameworks with
minimal computational overhead. Code is available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种自适应帧剪枝（AFP）方法，通过智能剪枝关键帧减少视频问答中的高令牌成本，同时提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在视频问答（Video-QA）中因处理大量视频帧的高令牌成本而受限，且过多帧可能导致性能下降。

Method: 采用自适应层次聚类算法在融合的ResNet-50和CLIP特征空间上识别并合并冗余帧，辅以轻量级文本语义图补充信息。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，帧数减少达86.9%，输入令牌减少达83.2%，且性能优于基线。

Conclusion: AFP方法显著提升了效率，同时改善了准确性，为视频问答提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: The practical application of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) to
Video Question Answering (Video-QA) is severely hindered by the high token cost
of processing numerous video frames. While increasing the number of sampled
frames is a common strategy, we observe a "less is more" phenomenon where
excessive frames can paradoxically degrade performance due to context dilution.
Concurrently, state-of-the-art keyframe selection methods, while effective,
still yield significant temporal redundancy, which we term 'visual echoes'. To
address these dual challenges, we propose Adaptive Frame-Pruning (AFP), a novel
post-processing method that intelligently prunes the selected keyframes. AFP
employs an adaptive hierarchical clustering algorithm on a fused ResNet-50 and
CLIP feature space to identify and merge these echoes into single
representatives. To compensate for information loss, we then introduce a
lightweight, text-based semantic graph that provides critical context with
minimal token overhead. Conducting extensive experiments on the LongVideoBench
and VideoMME benchmarks across multiple leading MLLMs, our full approach
demonstrates a drastic reduction in required frames by up to 86.9% and total
input tokens by up to 83.2%. Crucially, by providing a concise, high-quality
set of frames, our method not only enhances efficiency but often improves
accuracy over baselines that use more frames. The code will be released upon
publication.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出CIVQLLIE框架，通过离散表示学习和因果干预解决低光图像增强问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 夜间图像可见性差，现有方法缺乏解释性或依赖不可靠先验，物理方法假设简化。

Method: 利用向量量化（VQ）学习离散视觉标记，通过多级因果干预校正分布偏移。

Result: 框架有效增强低光图像，提升细节重建能力。

Conclusion: CIVQLLIE结合离散表示与因果干预，显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Images captured in nighttime scenes suffer from severely reduced visibility,
hindering effective content perception. Current low-light image enhancement
(LLIE) methods face significant challenges: data-driven end-to-end mapping
networks lack interpretability or rely on unreliable prior guidance, struggling
under extremely dark conditions, while physics-based methods depend on
simplified assumptions that often fail in complex real-world scenarios. To
address these limitations, we propose CIVQLLIE, a novel framework that
leverages the power of discrete representation learning through causal
reasoning. We achieve this through Vector Quantization (VQ), which maps
continuous image features to a discrete codebook of visual tokens learned from
large-scale high-quality images. This codebook serves as a reliable prior,
encoding standardized brightness and color patterns that are independent of
degradation. However, direct application of VQ to low-light images fails due to
distribution shifts between degraded inputs and the learned codebook.
Therefore, we propose a multi-level causal intervention approach to
systematically correct these shifts. First, during encoding, our Pixel-level
Causal Intervention (PCI) module intervenes to align low-level features with
the brightness and color distributions expected by the codebook. Second, a
Feature-aware Causal Intervention (FCI) mechanism with Low-frequency Selective
Attention Gating (LSAG) identifies and enhances channels most affected by
illumination degradation, facilitating accurate codebook token matching while
enhancing the encoder's generalization performance through flexible
feature-level intervention. Finally, during decoding, the High-frequency Detail
Reconstruction Module (HDRM) leverages structural information preserved in the
matched codebook representations to reconstruct fine details using deformable
convolution techniques.

TL;DR: WaMo是一种基于小波的多频率特征提取框架，用于改进文本与3D运动序列的语义对齐，显著提升了检索性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在匹配3D运动与文本时忽略了人体结构的复杂性和时空动态性，导致语义对齐不精确。

Method: WaMo通过轨迹小波分解、轨迹小波重构和乱序运动序列预测三个关键组件，提取多分辨率运动特征以实现细粒度对齐。

Result: 在HumanML3D和KIT-ML数据集上，WaMo分别实现了17.0%和18.2%的Rsum提升，优于现有SOTA方法。

Conclusion: WaMo通过多频率特征提取和时空信息保留，显著提升了文本与运动序列的语义对齐效果。

Abstract: Text-Motion Retrieval (TMR) aims to retrieve 3D motion sequences semantically
relevant to text descriptions. However, matching 3D motions with text remains
highly challenging, primarily due to the intricate structure of human body and
its spatial-temporal dynamics. Existing approaches often overlook these
complexities, relying on general encoding methods that fail to distinguish
different body parts and their dynamics, limiting precise semantic alignment.
To address this, we propose WaMo, a novel wavelet-based multi-frequency feature
extraction framework. It fully captures part-specific and time-varying motion
details across multiple resolutions on body joints, extracting discriminative
motion features to achieve fine-grained alignment with texts. WaMo has three
key components: (1) Trajectory Wavelet Decomposition decomposes motion signals
into frequency components that preserve both local kinematic details and global
motion semantics. (2) Trajectory Wavelet Reconstruction uses learnable inverse
wavelet transforms to reconstruct original joint trajectories from extracted
features, ensuring the preservation of essential spatial-temporal information.
(3) Disordered Motion Sequence Prediction reorders shuffled motion sequences to
improve the learning of inherent temporal coherence, enhancing motion-text
alignment. Extensive experiments demonstrate WaMo's superiority, achieving
17.0\% and 18.2\% improvements in $Rsum$ on HumanML3D and KIT-ML datasets,
respectively, outperforming existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种针对视觉语言模型（VLMs）的重要性感知后训练量化框架VLMQ，解决了现有方法在VLMs中因模态差异导致的性能下降问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于Hessian的LLM后训练量化方法在VLMs中表现不佳，主要由于视觉和文本令牌的模态差异（视觉令牌冗余且文本令牌有限）。

Method: VLMQ通过优化重要性感知目标，生成增强的Hessian矩阵，并结合轻量级块级反向传播计算令牌级重要性因子。

Result: 在8个基准测试中，VLMQ在0.5B∼32B规模的VLMs上表现出色，尤其在低比特量化下显著提升性能，例如在2比特量化下MME-RealWorld任务提升16.45%。

Conclusion: VLMQ为VLMs的后训练量化提供了高效且有效的解决方案，显著提升了低比特量化下的性能。

Abstract: Post-training quantization (PTQ) has emerged as an effective approach for
compressing large models and accelerating their inference without retraining.
While PTQ has been extensively studied in the context of large language models
(LLMs), its applicability to vision-language models (VLMs) remains
underexplored. In this paper, we identify a modality discrepancy (\emph{i.e.},
limited text tokens \emph{vs.} excessive and redundant vision tokens) of VLMs.
However, existing Hessian-based LLM PTQ methods treat all tokens equally during
quantization, resulting in severe performance drops when applied to VLMs.
Motivated by this observation, we propose a novel importance-aware PTQ
framework tailored for VLMs, dubbed VLMQ. Specifically, to address vision token
redundancy, VLMQ 1) optimizes an importance-aware objective that yields an
enhanced Hessian with token-level importance factors, while retaining
compatibility with parallelized weight updates, and 2) ensures efficiency and
effectiveness by computing these factors via a single lightweight block-wise
backward pass, guided by a theoretical connection to token-level perturbations.
Extensive evaluations on 8 benchmarks across 0.5B$\sim$32B VLMs demonstrate the
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance of our VLMQ, particularly under low-bit
settings. For example, it achieves a substantial \textbf{16.45\%} improvement
on MME-RealWorld under 2-bit quantization.

Method: 两阶段方法：服务器端知识蒸馏对齐大模型与小模型表示，客户端训练轻量级分类器并聚合。

Result: 在五个图像分类基准测试中表现优于现有方法，适用于资源有限客户端。

Conclusion: FedPromo在性能、隐私和资源效率之间取得平衡，适用于多领域学习。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) is an established paradigm for training deep learning
models on decentralized data. However, as the size of the models grows,
conventional FL approaches often require significant computational resources on
client devices, which may not be feasible. We introduce FedPromo, a novel
framework that enables efficient adaptation of large-scale foundation models
stored on a central server to new domains encountered only by remote clients.
Instead of directly training the large model on client devices, FedPromo
optimizes lightweight proxy models via FL, significantly reducing computational
overhead while maintaining privacy. Our method follows a two-stage process:
first, server-side knowledge distillation aligns the representations of a
large-scale foundation model (e.g., a transformer) with those of a compact
counterpart (e.g., a CNN). Then, the compact model encoder is deployed to
client devices, where trainable classifiers are learned locally. These
classifiers are subsequently aggregated and seamlessly transferred back to the
foundation model, facilitating personalized adaptation without requiring direct
access to user data. Through novel regularization strategies, our framework
enables decentralized multi-domain learning, balancing performance, privacy,
and resource efficiency. Extensive experiments on five image classification
benchmarks demonstrate that FedPromo outperforms existing methods while
assuming limited-resource clients.

Method: 引入多退化特征调制和参数高效的低秩适应，结合高保真细节增强模块。

Result: 实验表明，DOD在视觉质量和推理效率上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DOD是一种高效且适应性强的图像修复方法。

Abstract: Diffusion models have revealed powerful potential in all-in-one image
restoration (AiOIR), which is talented in generating abundant texture details.
The existing AiOIR methods either retrain a diffusion model or fine-tune the
pretrained diffusion model with extra conditional guidance. However, they often
suffer from high inference costs and limited adaptability to diverse
degradation types. In this paper, we propose an efficient AiOIR method,
Diffusion Once and Done (DOD), which aims to achieve superior restoration
performance with only one-step sampling of Stable Diffusion (SD) models.
Specifically, multi-degradation feature modulation is first introduced to
capture different degradation prompts with a pretrained diffusion model. Then,
parameter-efficient conditional low-rank adaptation integrates the prompts to
enable the fine-tuning of the SD model for adapting to different degradation
types. Besides, a high-fidelity detail enhancement module is integrated into
the decoder of SD to improve structural and textural details. Experiments
demonstrate that our method outperforms existing diffusion-based restoration
approaches in both visual quality and inference efficiency.

Motivation: 当前深度学习方法忽略病理发展的解剖学背景，GRASP旨在填补这一空白。

Method: GRASP通过伪标签整合和特征对齐，利用现有解剖学分割模型增强病理分割。

Result: 在PET/CT数据集上，GRASP在多项评估指标中表现优异。

Conclusion: GRASP的双重解剖注入策略有效整合解剖学背景，提升病理分割性能。

Abstract: Radiologists rely on anatomical understanding to accurately delineate
pathologies, yet most current deep learning approaches use pure pattern
recognition and ignore the anatomical context in which pathologies develop. To
narrow this gap, we introduce GRASP (Guided Representation Alignment for the
Segmentation of Pathologies), a modular plug-and-play framework that enhances
pathology segmentation models by leveraging existing anatomy segmentation
models through pseudolabel integration and feature alignment. Unlike previous
approaches that obtain anatomical knowledge via auxiliary training, GRASP
integrates into standard pathology optimization regimes without retraining
anatomical components. We evaluate GRASP on two PET/CT datasets, conduct
systematic ablation studies, and investigate the framework's inner workings. We
find that GRASP consistently achieves top rankings across multiple evaluation
metrics and diverse architectures. The framework's dual anatomy injection
strategy, combining anatomical pseudo-labels as input channels with
transformer-guided anatomical feature fusion, effectively incorporates
anatomical context.

Result: 实验表明GaitAdapter能有效保留多任务知识，性能优于其他方法。

Conclusion: GaitAdapter显著提升了持续步态识别的性能，解决了知识遗忘问题。

Abstract: Current gait recognition methodologies generally necessitate retraining when
encountering new datasets. Nevertheless, retrained models frequently encounter
difficulties in preserving knowledge from previous datasets, leading to a
significant decline in performance on earlier test sets. To tackle these
challenges, we present a continual gait recognition task, termed GaitAdapt,
which supports the progressive enhancement of gait recognition capabilities
over time and is systematically categorized according to various evaluation
scenarios. Additionally, we propose GaitAdapter, a non-replay continual
learning approach for gait recognition. This approach integrates the
GaitPartition Adaptive Knowledge (GPAK) module, employing graph neural networks
to aggregate common gait patterns from current data into a repository
constructed from graph vectors. Subsequently, this repository is used to
improve the discriminability of gait features in new tasks, thereby enhancing
the model's ability to effectively recognize gait patterns. We also introduce a
Euclidean Distance Stability Method (EDSN) based on negative pairs, which
ensures that newly added gait samples from different classes maintain similar
relative spatial distributions across both previous and current gait tasks,
thereby alleviating the impact of task changes on the distinguishability of
original domain features. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that GaitAdapter
effectively retains gait knowledge acquired from diverse tasks, exhibiting
markedly superior discriminative capability compared to alternative methods.

Result: 在多个分布外基准测试中，NAVIA性能优于现有方法2.5%以上，同时减少推理延迟20%以上。

Conclusion: NAVIA有效解决了高效测试时适应（ETTA）问题，平衡了性能与计算效率。

Abstract: Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) has emerged as an effective solution for adapting
Vision Transformers (ViT) to distribution shifts without additional training
data. However, existing TTA methods often incur substantial computational
overhead, limiting their applicability in resource-constrained real-world
scenarios. To reduce inference cost, plug-and-play token aggregation methods
merge redundant tokens in ViTs to reduce total processed tokens. Albeit
efficient, it suffers from significant performance degradation when directly
integrated with existing TTA methods. We formalize this problem as Efficient
Test-Time Adaptation (ETTA), seeking to preserve the adaptation capability of
TTA while reducing inference latency. In this paper, we first provide a
theoretical analysis from a novel mutual information perspective, showing that
token aggregation inherently leads to information loss, which cannot be fully
mitigated by conventional norm-tuning-based TTA methods. Guided by this
insight, we propose to \textbf{N}eutralize Token \textbf{A}ggregation
\textbf{v}ia \textbf{I}nformation \textbf{A}ugmentation (\textbf{NAVIA}).
Specifically, we directly augment the [CLS] token embedding and incorporate
adaptive biases into the [CLS] token in shallow layers of ViTs. We
theoretically demonstrate that these augmentations, when optimized via entropy
minimization, recover the information lost due to token aggregation. Extensive
experiments across various out-of-distribution benchmarks demonstrate that
NAVIA significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods by over 2.5\%, while
achieving an inference latency reduction of more than 20\%, effectively
addressing the ETTA challenge.

Result: 在标准基准测试中达到SOTA性能，挑战数据集上取得高Rank-1准确率。

Conclusion: DepthGait通过多模态融合显著提升步态识别性能，验证了深度图的潜力。

Abstract: Robust gait recognition requires highly discriminative representations, which
are closely tied to input modalities. While binary silhouettes and skeletons
have dominated recent literature, these 2D representations fall short of
capturing sufficient cues that can be exploited to handle viewpoint variations,
and capture finer and meaningful details of gait. In this paper, we introduce a
novel framework, termed DepthGait, that incorporates RGB-derived depth maps and
silhouettes for enhanced gait recognition. Specifically, apart from the 2D
silhouette representation of the human body, the proposed pipeline explicitly
estimates depth maps from a given RGB image sequence and uses them as a new
modality to capture discriminative features inherent in human locomotion. In
addition, a novel multi-scale and cross-level fusion scheme has also been
developed to bridge the modality gap between depth maps and silhouettes.
Extensive experiments on standard benchmarks demonstrate that the proposed
DepthGait achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to peer methods and
attains an impressive mean rank-1 accuracy on the challenging datasets.

Result: SCFlow在ImageNet-1k和WikiArt上实现零样本泛化，性能竞争性强。

Conclusion: 可逆合并过程自然实现解缠，为可控生成任务提供新思路。

Abstract: Explicitly disentangling style and content in vision models remains
challenging due to their semantic overlap and the subjectivity of human
perception. Existing methods propose separation through generative or
discriminative objectives, but they still face the inherent ambiguity of
disentangling intertwined concepts. Instead, we ask: Can we bypass explicit
disentanglement by learning to merge style and content invertibly, allowing
separation to emerge naturally? We propose SCFlow, a flow-matching framework
that learns bidirectional mappings between entangled and disentangled
representations. Our approach is built upon three key insights: 1) Training
solely to merge style and content, a well-defined task, enables invertible
disentanglement without explicit supervision; 2) flow matching bridges on
arbitrary distributions, avoiding the restrictive Gaussian priors of diffusion
models and normalizing flows; and 3) a synthetic dataset of 510,000 samples (51
styles $\times$ 10,000 content samples) was curated to simulate disentanglement
through systematic style-content pairing. Beyond controllable generation tasks,
we demonstrate that SCFlow generalizes to ImageNet-1k and WikiArt in zero-shot
settings and achieves competitive performance, highlighting that
disentanglement naturally emerges from the invertible merging process.

Conclusion: STVMLU方法有效提升了高光谱解混的精度。

Abstract: Hyperspectral unmixing aims at estimating material signatures (known as
endmembers) and the corresponding proportions (referred to abundances), which
is a critical preprocessing step in various hyperspectral imagery applications.
This study develops a novel approach called sparsity and total variation (TV)
constrained multilayer linear unmixing (STVMLU) for hyperspectral imagery.
Specifically, based on a multilayer matrix factorization model, to improve the
accuracy of unmixing, a TV constraint is incorporated to consider adjacent
spatial similarity. Additionally, a L1/2-norm sparse constraint is adopted to
effectively characterize the sparsity of the abundance matrix. For optimizing
the STVMLU model, the method of alternating direction method of multipliers
(ADMM) is employed, which allows for the simultaneous extraction of endmembers
and their corresponding abundance matrix. Experimental results illustrate the
enhanced performance of the proposed STVMLU when compared to other algorithms.

To address this, we propose MACT, a Multi-Agent Collaboration framework with
Test-Time scaling, tailored for visual document understanding and visual
question answering (VQA). It comprises four distinct small-scale agents, i.e.,
planning, execution, judgment, and answer agents, with clearly defined roles
and effective collaboration. Notably, the judgment agent exclusively verifies
correctness and redirects to prior agents for revisions, outperforming
conventional correction strategies. To further expand the capability boundaries
of the framework, we propose mixed reward modeling that balances agent-specific
abilities and global collaboration, as well as agent-wise hybrid test-time
scaling, which customizes different scaling strategies for each agent based on
their functions. Evaluated on benchmarks spanning both document-based and
non-document-based settings, our MACT shows superior performance with a smaller
parameter scale without sacrificing the ability of general and mathematical
tasks. Especially, it stands out in benchmarks involving long visual contexts
and complicated reasoning. The three variants of MACT consistently hold the top
three positions in average scores, leading in 13 of the 15 benchmarks. Code

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为SlotMatch的简单知识蒸馏框架，将对象中心表示高效传递给轻量级学生模型，无需额外目标或监督。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决无监督视频分割任务中缺乏监督信号和复杂视觉场景的挑战，同时避免依赖大型计算昂贵的模型。

Method: 通过余弦相似度对齐师生模型的slot表示，无需额外蒸馏目标或辅助监督。

Result: 实验表明，基于SlotMatch的学生模型在参数减少3.6倍、速度提升1.9倍的情况下，性能匹配甚至超越教师模型。

Conclusion: SlotMatch框架简单高效，学生模型性能优于现有无监督视频分割模型。

Abstract: Unsupervised video segmentation is a challenging computer vision task,
especially due to the lack of supervisory signals coupled with the complexity
of visual scenes. To overcome this challenge, state-of-the-art models based on
slot attention often have to rely on large and computationally expensive neural
architectures. To this end, we propose a simple knowledge distillation
framework that effectively transfers object-centric representations to a
lightweight student. The proposed framework, called SlotMatch, aligns
corresponding teacher and student slots via the cosine similarity, requiring no
additional distillation objectives or auxiliary supervision. The simplicity of
SlotMatch is confirmed via theoretical and empirical evidence, both indicating
that integrating additional losses is redundant. We conduct experiments on two
datasets to compare the state-of-the-art teacher model, SlotContrast, with our
distilled student. The results show that our student based on SlotMatch matches
and even outperforms its teacher, while using 3.6x less parameters and running
1.9x faster. Moreover, our student surpasses previous unsupervised video
segmentation models.

TL;DR: Fd-CycleGAN是一种改进的I2I翻译框架，通过局部邻域编码和频率感知监督增强潜在表示学习，优于CycleGAN和其他先进方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提升图像翻译任务中潜在表示学习的能力，以更好地逼近真实数据分布。

Method: 结合局部邻域编码（LNE）和频率感知监督，使用KL/JS散度和基于对数的相似性度量来量化生成图像与真实图像的分布对齐。

Result: 在Horse2Zebra、Monet2Photo等数据集上表现优异，具有更好的感知质量、更快的收敛速度和更高的模式多样性。

Conclusion: Fd-CycleGAN通过频率引导的潜在学习显著提升了图像翻译任务的泛化能力，适用于文档修复、艺术风格迁移和医学图像合成等领域。

Abstract: This paper presents Fd-CycleGAN, an image-to-image (I2I) translation
framework that enhances latent representation learning to approximate real data
distributions. Building upon the foundation of CycleGAN, our approach
integrates Local Neighborhood Encoding (LNE) and frequency-aware supervision to
capture fine-grained local pixel semantics while preserving structural
coherence from the source domain. We employ distribution-based loss metrics,
including KL/JS divergence and log-based similarity measures, to explicitly
quantify the alignment between real and generated image distributions in both
spatial and frequency domains. To validate the efficacy of Fd-CycleGAN, we
conduct experiments on diverse datasets -- Horse2Zebra, Monet2Photo, and a
synthetically augmented Strike-off dataset. Compared to baseline CycleGAN and
other state-of-the-art methods, our approach demonstrates superior perceptual
quality, faster convergence, and improved mode diversity, particularly in
low-data regimes. By effectively capturing local and global distribution
characteristics, Fd-CycleGAN achieves more visually coherent and semantically
consistent translations. Our results suggest that frequency-guided latent
learning significantly improves generalization in image translation tasks, with
promising applications in document restoration, artistic style transfer, and
medical image synthesis. We also provide comparative insights with
diffusion-based generative models, highlighting the advantages of our
lightweight adversarial approach in terms of training efficiency and
qualitative output.

Result: 实验验证了知识图谱和报告生成框架的有效性。

Conclusion: 提出的方法显著提升了医学报告生成的质量，并开源了代码。

Abstract: X-ray medical report generation is one of the important applications of
artificial intelligence in healthcare. With the support of large foundation
models, the quality of medical report generation has significantly improved.
However, challenges such as hallucination and weak disease diagnostic
capability still persist. In this paper, we first construct a large-scale
multi-modal medical knowledge graph (termed M3KG) based on the ground truth
medical report using the GPT-4o. It contains 2477 entities, 3 kinds of
relations, 37424 triples, and 6943 disease-aware vision tokens for the CheXpert
Plus dataset. Then, we sample it to obtain multi-granularity semantic graphs
and use an R-GCN encoder for feature extraction. For the input X-ray image, we
adopt the Swin-Transformer to extract the vision features and interact with the
knowledge using cross-attention. The vision tokens are fed into a Q-former and
retrieved the disease-aware vision tokens using another cross-attention.
Finally, we adopt the large language model to map the semantic knowledge graph,
input X-ray image, and disease-aware vision tokens into language descriptions.
Extensive experiments on multiple datasets fully validated the effectiveness of
our proposed knowledge graph and X-ray report generation framework. The source
code of this paper will be released on

TL;DR: IMAC是一种自监督框架，通过通道依赖掩码和插值任务解决跨域EEG信号分类中的数据分布偏移问题，实现了空间时间序列对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EEG信号分类因电极配置、采集协议和硬件差异导致数据分布偏移，传统方法难以应对。

Method: IMAC采用3D到2D位置统一映射标准化电极布局，提出通道依赖掩码和空间时间序列插值任务，并分离时空信息建模。

Result: 在10个公开EEG数据集上，IMAC在跨主体和跨中心验证中达到最优分类准确率，鲁棒性显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: IMAC通过空间时间序列对齐和时空信息解耦，有效解决了跨域EEG信号分类问题，具有强鲁棒性和适应性。

Abstract: Electroencephalogram (EEG) signal classification faces significant challenges
due to data distribution shifts caused by heterogeneous electrode
configurations, acquisition protocols, and hardware discrepancies across
domains. This paper introduces IMAC, a novel channel-dependent mask and
imputation self-supervised framework that formulates the alignment of
cross-domain EEG data shifts as a spatial time series imputation task. To
address heterogeneous electrode configurations in cross-domain scenarios, IMAC
first standardizes different electrode layouts using a 3D-to-2D positional
unification mapping strategy, establishing unified spatial representations.
Unlike previous mask-based self-supervised representation learning methods,
IMAC introduces spatio-temporal signal alignment. This involves constructing a
channel-dependent mask and reconstruction task framed as a low-to-high
resolution EEG spatial imputation problem. Consequently, this approach
simulates cross-domain variations such as channel omissions and temporal
instabilities, thus enabling the model to leverage the proposed imputer for
robust signal alignment during inference. Furthermore, IMAC incorporates a
disentangled structure that separately models the temporal and spatial
information of the EEG signals separately, reducing computational complexity
while enhancing flexibility and adaptability. Comprehensive evaluations across
10 publicly available EEG datasets demonstrate IMAC's superior performance,
achieving state-of-the-art classification accuracy in both cross-subject and
cross-center validation scenarios. Notably, IMAC shows strong robustness under
both simulated and real-world distribution shifts, surpassing baseline methods
by up to $35$\% in integrity scores while maintaining consistent classification
accuracy.

TL;DR: 论文提出了MedCAL-Bench，首个基于基础模型（FMs）的冷启动主动学习（CSAL）基准测试，用于医学图像分析，评估了14种FMs和7种CSAL策略在7个数据集上的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 冷启动主动学习（CSAL）在医学图像分析中缺乏高效的特征提取方法，且现有方法依赖于自监督学习（SSL），特征表示不足。基础模型（FMs）具有强大的特征提取能力，但缺乏相关研究。

Method: 提出了MedCAL-Bench基准测试，评估14种FMs和7种CSAL策略在7个数据集上的表现，涵盖分类和分割任务。

Result: 1）大多数FMs在CSAL中是有效的特征提取器，DINO家族在分割任务中表现最佳；2）FMs在分割任务中性能差异较大，分类任务中差异较小；3）不同数据集需采用不同样本选择策略。

Conclusion: MedCAL-Bench为医学图像分析中的CSAL任务提供了首个系统性的FM基准测试，揭示了FMs和样本选择策略的适用性差异。

Abstract: Cold-Start Active Learning (CSAL) aims to select informative samples for
annotation without prior knowledge, which is important for improving annotation
efficiency and model performance under a limited annotation budget in medical
image analysis. Most existing CSAL methods rely on Self-Supervised Learning
(SSL) on the target dataset for feature extraction, which is inefficient and
limited by insufficient feature representation. Recently, pre-trained
Foundation Models (FMs) have shown powerful feature extraction ability with a
potential for better CSAL. However, this paradigm has been rarely investigated,
with a lack of benchmarks for comparison of FMs in CSAL tasks. To this end, we
propose MedCAL-Bench, the first systematic FM-based CSAL benchmark for medical
image analysis. We evaluate 14 FMs and 7 CSAL strategies across 7 datasets
under different annotation budgets, covering classification and segmentation
tasks from diverse medical modalities. It is also the first CSAL benchmark that
evaluates both the feature extraction and sample selection stages. Our
experimental results reveal that: 1) Most FMs are effective feature extractors
for CSAL, with DINO family performing the best in segmentation; 2) The
performance differences of these FMs are large in segmentation tasks, while
small for classification; 3) Different sample selection strategies should be
considered in CSAL on different datasets, with Active Learning by Processing
Surprisal (ALPS) performing the best in segmentation while RepDiv leading for
classification. The code is available at

Motivation: 探索引导尺度在流式生成模型不同采样阶段的作用，尤其是快速低步长采样中的不稳定性问题。

Method: 通过理论分析和实证验证，提出一种基于RATIO的自适应引导调度方法，动态调整早期步长的引导尺度。

Result: 实验表明该方法在图像和视频生成中实现了3倍加速，同时保持或提升生成质量、鲁棒性和语义对齐。

Conclusion: 自适应引导调度是释放快速流式生成模型潜力的关键。

Abstract: Flow-based generative models have recently achieved remarkable progress in
image and video synthesis, with classifier-free guidance (CFG) becoming the
standard tool for high-fidelity, controllable generation. However, despite
their practical success, little is known about how guidance interacts with
different stages of the sampling process-especially in the fast, low-step
regimes typical of modern flow-based pipelines. In this work, we uncover and
analyze a fundamental instability: the earliest reverse steps are acutely
sensitive to the guidance scale, owing to a pronounced spike in the relative
strength (RATIO) of conditional to unconditional predictions. Through rigorous
theoretical analysis and empirical validation, we show that this RATIO spike is
intrinsic to the data distribution, independent of the model architecture, and
causes exponential error amplification when paired with strong guidance. To
address this, we propose a simple, theoretically grounded, RATIO-aware adaptive
guidance schedule that automatically dampens the guidance scale at early steps
based on the evolving RATIO, using a closed-form exponential decay. Our method
is lightweight, requires no additional inference overhead, and is compatible
with standard flow frameworks. Experiments across state-of-the-art image
(SD3.5, Lumina) and video (WAN2.1) models demonstrate that our approach enables
up to 3x faster sampling while maintaining or improving generation quality,
robustness, and semantic alignment. Extensive ablation studies further confirm
the generality and stability of our schedule across models, datasets, and
hyperparameters. Our findings highlight the critical role of stepwise guidance
adaptation in unlocking the full potential of fast flow-based generative
models.

Result: 在13个工业和医学数据集上，CoPS在分类和分割任务中AUROC指标超过现有方法2.5%。

Conclusion: CoPS通过动态提示和语义融合显著提升了零样本异常检测的性能。

Abstract: Recently, large pre-trained vision-language models have shown remarkable
performance in zero-shot anomaly detection (ZSAD). With fine-tuning on a single
auxiliary dataset, the model enables cross-category anomaly detection on
diverse datasets covering industrial defects and medical lesions. Compared to
manually designed prompts, prompt learning eliminates the need for expert
knowledge and trial-and-error. However, it still faces the following
challenges: (i) static learnable tokens struggle to capture the continuous and
diverse patterns of normal and anomalous states, limiting generalization to
unseen categories; (ii) fixed textual labels provide overly sparse category
information, making the model prone to overfitting to a specific semantic
subspace. To address these issues, we propose Conditional Prompt Synthesis
(CoPS), a novel framework that synthesizes dynamic prompts conditioned on
visual features to enhance ZSAD performance. Specifically, we extract
representative normal and anomaly prototypes from fine-grained patch features
and explicitly inject them into prompts, enabling adaptive state modeling.
Given the sparsity of class labels, we leverage a variational autoencoder to
model semantic image features and implicitly fuse varied class tokens into
prompts. Additionally, integrated with our spatially-aware alignment mechanism,
extensive experiments demonstrate that CoPS surpasses state-of-the-art methods
by 2.5% AUROC in both classification and segmentation across 13 industrial and
medical datasets. Code will be available at https://github.com/cqylunlun/CoPS.

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著优于现有图像和视频去摩尔纹技术。

Conclusion: 双摄像头框架有效解决了摩尔纹与真实纹理的区分问题，同时保持了色调和时间一致性。

Abstract: Moire patterns, unwanted color artifacts in images and videos, arise from the
interference between spatially high-frequency scene contents and the spatial
discrete sampling of digital cameras. Existing demoireing methods primarily
rely on single-camera image/video processing, which faces two critical
challenges: 1) distinguishing moire patterns from visually similar real
textures, and 2) preserving tonal consistency and temporal coherence while
removing moire artifacts. To address these issues, we propose a dual-camera
framework that captures synchronized videos of the same scene: one in focus
(retaining high-quality textures but may exhibit moire patterns) and one
defocused (with significantly reduced moire patterns but blurred textures). We
use the defocused video to help distinguish moire patterns from real texture,
so as to guide the demoireing of the focused video. We propose a frame-wise
demoireing pipeline, which begins with an optical flow based alignment step to
address any discrepancies in displacement and occlusion between the focused and
defocused frames. Then, we leverage the aligned defocused frame to guide the
demoireing of the focused frame using a multi-scale CNN and a multi-dimensional
training loss. To maintain tonal and temporal consistency, our final step
involves a joint bilateral filter to leverage the demoireing result from the
CNN as the guide to filter the input focused frame to obtain the final output.
Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed framework largely
outperforms state-of-the-art image and video demoireing methods.

Conclusion: AVPDN为动态结肠镜视频中的息肉检测提供了高效且鲁棒的解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate detection of polyps is of critical importance for the early and
intermediate stages of colorectal cancer diagnosis. Compared to static images,
dynamic colonoscopy videos provide more comprehensive visual information, which
can facilitate the development of effective treatment plans. However, unlike
fixed-camera recordings, colonoscopy videos often exhibit rapid camera
movement, introducing substantial background noise that disrupts the structural
integrity of the scene and increases the risk of false positives. To address
these challenges, we propose the Adaptive Video Polyp Detection Network
(AVPDN), a robust framework for multi-scale polyp detection in colonoscopy
videos. AVPDN incorporates two key components: the Adaptive Feature Interaction
and Augmentation (AFIA) module and the Scale-Aware Context Integration (SACI)
module. The AFIA module adopts a triple-branch architecture to enhance feature
representation. It employs dense self-attention for global context modeling,
sparse self-attention to mitigate the influence of low query-key similarity in
feature aggregation, and channel shuffle operations to facilitate inter-branch
information exchange. In parallel, the SACI module is designed to strengthen
multi-scale feature integration. It utilizes dilated convolutions with varying
receptive fields to capture contextual information at multiple spatial scales,
thereby improving the model's denoising capability. Experiments conducted on
several challenging public benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness and
generalization ability of the proposed method, achieving competitive
performance in video-based polyp detection tasks.

Result: 实验表明IKOD能有效减少幻觉并提升模型性能，且无需额外成本。

Conclusion: IKOD是一种轻量高效的解码策略，适用于多种LVLM，显著改善幻觉问题。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated
significant progress across multiple domains. However, these models still face
the inherent challenge of integrating vision and language for collaborative
inference, which often leads to "hallucinations", outputs that are not grounded
in the corresponding images. Many efforts have been made to address these
issues, but each comes with its own limitations, such as high computational
cost or expensive dataset annotation. Recent research shows that LVLMs exhibit
a long-term bias where hallucinations increase as the sequence length grows,
yet the underlying cause remains poorly understood. Building on extensive
research into attention mechanisms in LVLMs, we analyze the relationship
between this long-term bias and visual attention. In our research, we identify
a consistent phenomenon in current LVLMs: the model's attention to visual input
diminishes as the generated sequence grows, which we hypothesize to be a key
factor contributing to observed increasing hallucinations. Based on these
insights, we propose Image attention-guided Key-value merging cOllaborative
Decoding (IKOD), a collaborative decoding strategy generating more
image-focused sequences. This method derives logits from shorter sequences with
higher image attention through key-value merging and combines them with those
from the original decoding, effectively mitigating attention degradation and
suppressing hallucinations while not incurring too much inference cost.
Extensive experiments on both hallucination and comprehensive benchmarks
demonstrate IKOD's superior effectiveness in mitigating hallucinations and
improving comprehensive capacities for LVLMs. Importantly, IKOD requires no
additional training or external tools, making it a lightweight and efficient
framework applicable to various models.

Motivation: 生成技术的快速发展可能导致视频内容被恶意编辑，现有方法对视频的保护不足。

Method: 采用联合帧优化和视频运动信息融合，干扰生成扩散模型的功能。

Result: 实验证明VideoGuard的保护性能优于基线方法。

Conclusion: VideoGuard能有效防止视频被未经授权的恶意编辑。

Abstract: With the rapid development of generative technology, current generative
models can generate high-fidelity digital content and edit it in a controlled
manner. However, there is a risk that malicious individuals might misuse these
capabilities for misleading activities. Although existing research has
attempted to shield photographic images from being manipulated by generative
models, there remains a significant disparity in the protection offered to
video content editing. To bridge the gap, we propose a protection method named
VideoGuard, which can effectively protect videos from unauthorized malicious
editing. This protection is achieved through the subtle introduction of nearly
unnoticeable perturbations that interfere with the functioning of the intended
generative diffusion models. Due to the redundancy between video frames, and
inter-frame attention mechanism in video diffusion models, simply applying
image-based protection methods separately to every video frame can not shield
video from unauthorized editing. To tackle the above challenge, we adopt joint
frame optimization, treating all video frames as an optimization entity.
Furthermore, we extract video motion information and fuse it into optimization
objectives. Thus, these alterations can effectively force the models to produce
outputs that are implausible and inconsistent. We provide a pipeline to
optimize this perturbation. Finally, we use both objective metrics and
subjective metrics to demonstrate the efficacy of our method, and the results
show that the protection performance of VideoGuard is superior to all the
baseline methods.

Abstract: Personalized generation in T2I diffusion models aims to naturally incorporate
individual user preferences into the generation process with minimal user
intervention. However, existing studies primarily rely on prompt-level modeling
with large-scale models, often leading to inaccurate personalization due to the
limited input token capacity of T2I diffusion models. To address these
limitations, we propose DrUM, a novel method that integrates user profiling
with a transformer-based adapter to enable personalized generation through
condition-level modeling in the latent space. DrUM demonstrates strong
performance on large-scale datasets and seamlessly integrates with open-source
text encoders, making it compatible with widely used foundation T2I models
without requiring additional fine-tuning.

Conclusion: SODA框架为揭示生成模型中的刻板印象提供了实用方法，是迈向更负责任AI开发的重要一步。

Abstract: While prior research on text-to-image generation has predominantly focused on
biases in human depictions, we investigate a more subtle yet pervasive
phenomenon: demographic bias in generated objects (e.g., cars). We introduce
SODA (Stereotyped Object Diagnostic Audit), a novel framework for
systematically measuring such biases. Our approach compares visual attributes
of objects generated with demographic cues (e.g., "for young people'') to those
from neutral prompts, across 2,700 images produced by three state-of-the-art
models (GPT Image-1, Imagen 4, and Stable Diffusion) in five object categories.
Through a comprehensive analysis, we uncover strong associations between
specific demographic groups and visual attributes, such as recurring color
patterns prompted by gender or ethnicity cues. These patterns reflect and
reinforce not only well-known stereotypes but also more subtle and unintuitive
biases. We also observe that some models generate less diverse outputs, which
in turn amplifies the visual disparities compared to neutral prompts. Our
proposed auditing framework offers a practical approach for testing, revealing
how stereotypes still remain embedded in today's generative models. We see this
as an essential step toward more systematic and responsible AI development.

text-to-image generation. However, their high computational cost and large
parameter sizes pose significant challenges for usage in resource-constrained
scenarios. Post-training quantization (PTQ) is a promising solution to reduce
memory usage and accelerate inference, but existing PTQ methods suffer from
severe performance degradation under extreme low-bit settings. We identify two
key obstacles to low-bit post-training quantization for DiT models: (1) model
weights follow a Gaussian-like distribution with long tails, causing uniform
quantization to poorly allocate intervals and leading to significant errors;
(2) two types of activation outliers: (i) Mild Outliers with slightly elevated
values, and (ii) Salient Outliers with large magnitudes concentrated in
specific channels, which disrupt activation quantization. To address these
issues, we propose LRQ-DiT, an efficient and accurate PTQ framework. We
introduce Twin-Log Quantization (TLQ), a log-based method that aligns well with
the weight distribution and reduces quantization errors. We also propose an
Adaptive Rotation Scheme (ARS) that dynamically applies Hadamard or
outlier-aware rotations based on activation fluctuation, effectively mitigating
the impact of both types of outliers. We evaluate LRQ-DiT on PixArt and FLUX
under various bit-width settings, and validate the performance on COCO, MJHQ,
and sDCI datasets. LRQ-DiT achieves low-bit quantization of DiT models while
preserving image quality, outperforming existing PTQ baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 建筑行业资源消耗大，回收材料质量监测仍依赖人工方法，亟需高效自动化解决方案。

Method: 提出ParticleSAM方法，改进基础分割模型，适用于小颗粒密集图像；构建模拟数据集支持验证。

Result: 实验证明ParticleSAM优于原始SAM方法，定量和定性结果均表现更优。

Conclusion: ParticleSAM为建筑废料质量监控提供高效工具，并适用于其他小颗粒分割场景。

Abstract: The construction industry represents a major sector in terms of resource
consumption. Recycled construction material has high reuse potential, but
quality monitoring of the aggregates is typically still performed with manual
methods. Vision-based machine learning methods could offer a faster and more
efficient solution to this problem, but existing segmentation methods are by
design not directly applicable to images with hundreds of small particles. In
this paper, we propose ParticleSAM, an adaptation of the segmentation
foundation model to images with small and dense objects such as the ones often
encountered in construction material particles. Moreover, we create a new dense
multi-particle dataset simulated from isolated particle images with the
assistance of an automated data generation and labeling pipeline. This dataset
serves as a benchmark for visual material quality control automation while our
segmentation approach has the potential to be valuable in application areas
beyond construction where small-particle segmentation is needed. Our
experimental results validate the advantages of our method by comparing to the
original SAM method both in quantitative and qualitative experiments.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于视觉组织病理学基础模型的语义缝合方法（SemanticStitcher），用于解决组织样本拼接中的挑战，并在实验中表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 组织样本在病理学中常因尺寸过大需要拼接，但现有方法受限于组织损失、形态变形等问题，难以实现自动化高效拼接。

Method: 利用视觉组织病理学基础模型提取潜在特征表示，通过语义匹配候选点进行稳健姿态估计，实现多片段拼接。

Result: 在三个数据集上的实验表明，SemanticStitcher在边界匹配准确性上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: SemanticStitcher为组织样本拼接提供了更稳健的解决方案，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: In histopathology, tissue samples are often larger than a standard microscope
slide, making stitching of multiple fragments necessary to process entire
structures such as tumors. Automated stitching is a prerequisite for scaling
analysis, but is challenging due to possible tissue loss during preparation,
inhomogeneous morphological distortion, staining inconsistencies, missing
regions due to misalignment on the slide, or frayed tissue edges. This limits
state-of-the-art stitching methods using boundary shape matching algorithms to
reconstruct artificial whole mount slides (WMS). Here, we introduce
SemanticStitcher using latent feature representations derived from a visual
histopathology foundation model to identify neighboring areas in different
fragments. Robust pose estimation based on a large number of semantic matching
candidates derives a mosaic of multiple fragments to form the WMS. Experiments
on three different histopathology datasets demonstrate that SemanticStitcher
yields robust WMS mosaicing and consistently outperforms the state of the art
in correct boundary matches.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文研究了稀疏字典学习（SDL）中稀疏性对图像恢复质量的影响，发现不同优化方法会导致不同的稀疏性水平，且高稀疏性通常不会损害恢复质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 稀疏性是SDL解决方案的重要属性，但如何在保证恢复质量的同时实现高稀疏性是一个关键问题。

Method: 通过多种优化方法（如迭代收缩算法）研究SDL中的稀疏性，并分析其对图像恢复的影响。

Result: 不同优化方法会导致不同的稀疏性水平，高稀疏性通常不会损害恢复质量。

Conclusion: 高稀疏性在SDL中是可实现的，且不会显著影响图像恢复质量。

Abstract: Sparse dictionary learning (SDL) is a fundamental technique that is useful
for many image processing tasks. As an example we consider here image recovery,
where SDL can be cast as a nonsmooth optimization problem. For this kind of
problems, iterative shrinkage methods represent a powerful class of algorithms
that are subject of ongoing research. Sparsity is an important property of the
learned solutions, as exactly the sparsity enables efficient further processing
or storage. The sparsity implies that a recovered image is determined as a
combination of a number of dictionary elements that is as low as possible.
Therefore, the question arises, to which degree sparsity should be enforced in
SDL in order to not compromise recovery quality. In this paper we focus on the
sparsity of solutions that can be obtained using a variety of optimization
methods. It turns out that there are different sparsity regimes depending on
the method in use. Furthermore, we illustrate that high sparsity does in
general not compromise recovery quality, even if the recovered image is quite
different from the learning database.

Motivation: 静态融合启发式和类别无关注意力在动态场景（如遮挡、杂乱和类别不平衡）中表现受限。

Method: 提出DyCAF-Net，包含输入条件平衡颈部、双动态注意力机制和类别感知特征适应。

Result: 在13个基准测试中显著提升精度和mAP，同时保持计算效率和推理速度。

Conclusion: DyCAF-Net是医学影像、监控和自动驾驶等实际检测任务的鲁棒解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advancements in object detection rely on modular architectures with
multi-scale fusion and attention mechanisms. However, static fusion heuristics
and class-agnostic attention limit performance in dynamic scenes with
occlusions, clutter, and class imbalance. We introduce Dynamic Class-Aware
Fusion Network (DyCAF-Net) that addresses these challenges through three
innovations: (1) an input-conditioned equilibrium-based neck that iteratively
refines multi-scale features via implicit fixed-point modeling, (2) a dual
dynamic attention mechanism that adaptively recalibrates channel and spatial
responses using input- and class-dependent cues, and (3) class-aware feature
adaptation that modulates features to prioritize discriminative regions for
rare classes. Through comprehensive ablation studies with YOLOv8 and related
architectures, alongside benchmarking against nine state-of-the-art baselines,
DyCAF-Net achieves significant improvements in precision, mAP@50, and mAP@50-95
across 13 diverse benchmarks, including occlusion-heavy and long-tailed
datasets. The framework maintains computational efficiency ($\sim$11.1M
parameters) and competitive inference speeds, while its adaptability to scale
variance, semantic overlaps, and class imbalance positions it as a robust
solution for real-world detection tasks in medical imaging, surveillance, and
autonomous systems.

Motivation: 医学数据固有的模糊性和变异性使得图像与文本报告的准确对齐具有挑战性，现有模型难以捕捉多层次的语义关系。

Method: PECM框架引入多级原型和双流置信度估计，利用原型相似性分布和自适应加权机制减少高不确定性数据的影响。

Result: 在多个数据集和任务中，PECM实现了最高10.17%的性能提升，达到新的最优水平。

Conclusion: PECM有效解决了医学跨模态检索中的数据模糊性问题，提升了复杂临床场景下的检索可靠性。

Abstract: In cross-modal retrieval tasks, such as image-to-report and report-to-image
retrieval, accurately aligning medical images with relevant text reports is
essential but challenging due to the inherent ambiguity and variability in
medical data. Existing models often struggle to capture the nuanced,
multi-level semantic relationships in radiology data, leading to unreliable
retrieval results. To address these issues, we propose the Prototype-Enhanced
Confidence Modeling (PECM) framework, which introduces multi-level prototypes
for each modality to better capture semantic variability and enhance retrieval
robustness. PECM employs a dual-stream confidence estimation that leverages
prototype similarity distributions and an adaptive weighting mechanism to
control the impact of high-uncertainty data on retrieval rankings. Applied to
radiology image-report datasets, our method achieves significant improvements
in retrieval precision and consistency, effectively handling data ambiguity and
advancing reliability in complex clinical scenarios. We report results on
multiple different datasets and tasks including fully supervised and zero-shot
retrieval obtaining performance gains of up to 10.17%, establishing in new
state-of-the-art.

Conclusion: 提出的自动化管道和评估指标为服装编辑任务提供了可靠的数据支持。

Abstract: Instruction-based garment editing enables precise image modifications via
natural language, with broad applications in fashion design and customization.
Unlike general editing tasks, it requires understanding garment-specific
semantics and attribute dependencies. However, progress is limited by the
scarcity of high-quality instruction-image pairs, as manual annotation is
costly and hard to scale. While MLLMs have shown promise in automated data
synthesis, their application to garment editing is constrained by imprecise
instruction modeling and a lack of fashion-specific supervisory signals. To
address these challenges, we present an automated pipeline for constructing a
garment editing dataset. We first define six editing instruction categories
aligned with real-world fashion workflows to guide the generation of balanced
and diverse instruction-image triplets. Second, we introduce Fashion Edit
Score, a semantic-aware evaluation metric that captures semantic dependencies
between garment attributes and provides reliable supervision during
construction. Using this pipeline, we construct a total of 52,257 candidate
triplets and retain 20,596 high-quality triplets to build EditGarment, the
first instruction-based dataset tailored to standalone garment editing. The

Conclusion: MAUP为跨域少样本医学图像分割提供了一种高效、无需训练的解决方案。

Abstract: Cross-domain Few-shot Medical Image Segmentation (CD-FSMIS) is a potential
solution for segmenting medical images with limited annotation using knowledge
from other domains. The significant performance of current CD-FSMIS models
relies on the heavily training procedure over other source medical domains,
which degrades the universality and ease of model deployment. With the
development of large visual models of natural images, we propose a
training-free CD-FSMIS model that introduces the Multi-center Adaptive
Uncertainty-aware Prompting (MAUP) strategy for adapting the foundation model
Segment Anything Model (SAM), which is trained with natural images, into the
CD-FSMIS task. To be specific, MAUP consists of three key innovations: (1)
K-means clustering based multi-center prompts generation for comprehensive
spatial coverage, (2) uncertainty-aware prompts selection that focuses on the
challenging regions, and (3) adaptive prompt optimization that can dynamically
adjust according to the target region complexity. With the pre-trained DINOv2
feature encoder, MAUP achieves precise segmentation results across three
medical datasets without any additional training compared with several
conventional CD-FSMIS models and training-free FSMIS model. The source code is

Conclusion: 视网膜血管结构反映了循环脂质谱的差异，支持其作为系统性代谢健康的无创标志物，并首次在健康人群中结合深度学习与脂质组学。

Abstract: Retinal microvascular imaging is increasingly recognised as a non invasive
method for evaluating systemic vascular and metabolic health. However, the
association between lipidomics and retinal vasculature remains inadequate. This
study investigates the relationships between serum lipid subclasses, free fatty
acids (FA), diacylglycerols (DAG), triacylglycerols (TAG), and cholesteryl
esters (CE), and retinal microvascular characteristics in a large
population-based cohort. Using Spearman correlation analysis, we examined the
interconnection between lipid subclasses and ten retinal microvascular traits,
applying the Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate (BH-FDR) to adjust for
statistical significance.
  Results indicated that FA were linked to retinal vessel twistiness, while CE
correlated with the average widths of arteries and veins. Conversely, DAG and
TAG showed negative correlations with the width and complexity of arterioles
and venules. These findings suggest that retinal vascular architecture reflects
distinct circulating lipid profiles, supporting its role as a non-invasive
marker of systemic metabolic health. This study is the first to integrate deep
learning (DL)derived retinal traits with lipidomic subclasses in a healthy
cohort, thereby providing insights into microvascular structural changes
independent of disease status or treatment effects.

Conclusion: DKUA框架通过分布感知和跨域知识统一，显著提升了终身行人重识别的性能。

Abstract: Lifelong person re-identification (LReID) encounters a key challenge:
balancing the preservation of old knowledge with adaptation to new information.
Existing LReID methods typically employ knowledge distillation to enforce
representation alignment. However, these approaches ignore two crucial aspects:
specific distribution awareness and cross-domain unified knowledge learning,
both of which are essential for addressing this challenge. To overcome these
limitations, we propose a novel distribution-aware knowledge unification and
association (DKUA) framework where domain-style modeling is performed for each
instance to propagate domain-specific representations, enhancing
anti-forgetting and generalization capacity. Specifically, we design a
distribution-aware model to transfer instance-level representations of the
current domain into the domain-specific representations with the different
domain styles, preserving learned knowledge without storing old samples. Next,
we propose adaptive knowledge consolidation (AKC) to dynamically generate the
unified representation as a cross-domain representation center. To further
mitigate forgetting, we develop a unified knowledge association (UKA)
mechanism, which explores the unified representation as a bridge to explicitly
model inter-domain associations, reducing inter-domain gaps. Finally,
distribution-based knowledge transfer (DKT) is proposed to prevent the current
domain distribution from deviating from the cross-domain distribution center,
improving adaptation capacity. Experimental results show our DKUA outperforms
the existing methods by 7.6%/5.3% average mAP/R@1 improvement on
anti-forgetting and generalization capacity, respectively. Our code will be
publicly released.

Conclusion: MetaScope成功填补了金属透镜内窥镜的研究空白，为未来超微成像提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Miniaturized endoscopy has advanced accurate visual perception within the
human body. Prevailing research remains limited to conventional cameras
employing convex lenses, where the physical constraints with millimetre-scale
thickness impose serious impediments on the micro-level clinical. Recently,
with the emergence of meta-optics, ultra-micro imaging based on metalenses
(micron-scale) has garnered great attention, serving as a promising solution.
However, due to the physical difference of metalens, there is a large gap in
data acquisition and algorithm research. In light of this, we aim to bridge
this unexplored gap, advancing the novel metalens endoscopy. First, we
establish datasets for metalens endoscopy and conduct preliminary optical
simulation, identifying two derived optical issues that physically adhere to
strong optical priors. Second, we propose MetaScope, a novel optics-driven
neural network tailored for metalens endoscopy driven by physical optics.
MetaScope comprises two novel designs: Optics-informed Intensity Adjustment
(OIA), rectifying intensity decay by learning optical embeddings, and
Optics-informed Chromatic Correction (OCC), mitigating chromatic aberration by
learning spatial deformations informed by learned Point Spread Function (PSF)
distributions. To enhance joint learning, we further deploy a gradient-guided
distillation to transfer knowledge from the foundational model adaptively.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that MetaScope not only outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in both metalens segmentation and restoration but also
achieves impressive generalized ability in real biomedical scenes.

Abstract: Emotional Image Content Generation (EICG) aims to generate semantically clear
and emotionally faithful images based on given emotion categories, with broad
application prospects. While recent text-to-image diffusion models excel at
generating concrete concepts, they struggle with the complexity of abstract
emotions. There have also emerged methods specifically designed for EICG, but
they excessively rely on word-level attribute labels for guidance, which suffer
from semantic incoherence, ambiguity, and limited scalability. To address these
challenges, we propose CoEmoGen, a novel pipeline notable for its semantic
coherence and high scalability. Specifically, leveraging multimodal large
language models (MLLMs), we construct high-quality captions focused on
emotion-triggering content for context-rich semantic guidance. Furthermore,
inspired by psychological insights, we design a Hierarchical Low-Rank
Adaptation (HiLoRA) module to cohesively model both polarity-shared low-level
features and emotion-specific high-level semantics. Extensive experiments
demonstrate CoEmoGen's superiority in emotional faithfulness and semantic
coherence from quantitative, qualitative, and user study perspectives. To
intuitively showcase scalability, we curate EmoArt, a large-scale dataset of

Abstract: Despite substantial progress in anomaly synthesis methods, existing
diffusion-based and coarse inpainting pipelines commonly suffer from structural
deficiencies such as micro-structural discontinuities, limited semantic
controllability, and inefficient generation. To overcome these limitations, we
introduce ARAS, a language-conditioned, auto-regressive anomaly synthesis
approach that precisely injects local, text-specified defects into normal
images via token-anchored latent editing. Leveraging a hard-gated
auto-regressive operator and a training-free, context-preserving masked
sampling kernel, ARAS significantly enhances defect realism, preserves
fine-grained material textures, and provides continuous semantic control over
synthesized anomalies. Integrated within our Quality-Aware Re-weighted Anomaly
Detection (QARAD) framework, we further propose a dynamic weighting strategy
that emphasizes high-quality synthetic samples by computing an image-text
similarity score with a dual-encoder model. Extensive experiments across three
benchmark datasets-MVTec AD, VisA, and BTAD, demonstrate that our QARAD
outperforms SOTA methods in both image- and pixel-level anomaly detection
tasks, achieving improved accuracy, robustness, and a 5 times synthesis speedup
compared to diffusion-based alternatives. Our complete code and synthesized
dataset will be publicly available.

Conclusion: 该研究为数学内容识别的多模态AI奠定了基础。

Abstract: Conversion of spoken mathematical expressions is a challenging task that
involves transcribing speech into a strictly structured symbolic representation
while addressing the ambiguity inherent in the pronunciation of equations.
Although significant progress has been achieved in automatic speech recognition
(ASR) and language models (LM), the problem of converting spoken mathematics
into LaTeX remains underexplored. This task directly applies to educational and
research domains, such as lecture transcription or note creation. Based on ASR
post-correction, prior work requires 2 transcriptions, focuses only on isolated
equations, has a limited test set, and provides neither training data nor
multilingual coverage. To address these issues, we present the first fully
open-source large-scale dataset, comprising over 66,000 human-annotated audio
samples of mathematical equations and sentences in both English and Russian,
drawn from diverse scientific domains. In addition to the ASR post-correction
models and few-shot prompting, we apply audio language models, demonstrating
comparable character error rate (CER) results on the MathSpeech benchmark (28%
vs. 30%) for the equations conversion. In contrast, on the proposed

TL;DR: 使用无人机和热成像技术估算奥地利东南部野生动物密度，并与相机陷阱数据对比，结果显示无人机方法更高效且结果相似。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法（如捕获-重捕获、距离采样或相机陷阱）劳动密集或空间受限，无人机提供了一种高效、非侵入性的替代方案。

Method: 在无叶期使用无人机进行航测，结合热成像和RGB图像，采用三种密度外推方法，并与相机陷阱的随机相遇模型（REM）对比。

Result: 无人机方法估算的密度与REM相似，通常更高，但反映了白天活动与森林区域的差异。

Conclusion: 无人机是一种有前景且可扩展的野生动物密度估算方法。

Abstract: We use unmanned aerial drones to estimate wildlife density in southeastern
Austria and compare these estimates to camera trap data. Traditional methods
like capture-recapture, distance sampling, or camera traps are well-established
but labour-intensive or spatially constrained. Using thermal (IR) and RGB
imagery, drones enable efficient, non-intrusive animal counting. Our surveys
were conducted during the leafless period on single days in October and
November 2024 in three areas of a sub-Illyrian hill and terrace landscape.
Flight transects were based on predefined launch points using a 350 m grid and
an algorithm that defined the direction of systematically randomized transects.
This setup allowed surveying large areas in one day using multiple drones,
minimizing double counts. Flight altitude was set at 60 m to avoid disturbing
roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) while ensuring detection. Animals were manually
annotated in the recorded imagery and extrapolated to densities per square
kilometer. We applied three extrapolation methods with increasing complexity:
naive area-based extrapolation, bootstrapping, and zero-inflated negative
binomial modelling. For comparison, a Random Encounter Model (REM) estimate was
calculated using camera trap data from the flight period. The drone-based
methods yielded similar results, generally showing higher densities than REM,
except in one area in October. We hypothesize that drone-based density reflects
daytime activity in open and forested areas, while REM estimates average
activity over longer periods within forested zones. Although both approaches
estimate density, they offer different perspectives on wildlife presence. Our
results show that drones offer a promising, scalable method for wildlife
density estimation.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种更广泛的模因匹配方法，超越传统基于模板的方法，并探讨了不同相似性度量及多模态大语言模型在模因匹配中的应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模因匹配方法大多局限于基于模板的模因，忽略了非模板模因，限制了自动模因分析的效能。

Method: 引入了一种更广泛的模因匹配方法，包括传统相似性度量、分段相似性计算及多模态大语言模型提示方法。

Result: 传统方法在模板模因上表现良好，但在非模板模因上效果有限；分段相似性方法在非模板模因上表现更优。

Conclusion: 准确匹配模因的共享视觉元素仍是一个开放挑战，需要更复杂的技术。

Abstract: Internet memes, now a staple of digital communication, play a pivotal role in
how users engage within online communities and allow researchers to gain
insight into contemporary digital culture. These engaging user-generated
content are characterised by their reuse of visual elements also found in other
memes. Matching instances of memes via these shared visual elements, called
Meme Matching, is the basis of a wealth of meme analysis approaches. However,
most existing methods assume that every meme consists of a shared visual
background, called a Template, with some overlaid text, thereby limiting meme
matching to comparing the background image alone. Current approaches exclude
the many memes that are not template-based and limit the effectiveness of
automated meme analysis and would not be effective at linking memes to
contemporary web-based meme dictionaries. In this work, we introduce a broader
formulation of meme matching that extends beyond template matching. We show
that conventional similarity measures, including a novel segment-wise
computation of the similarity measures, excel at matching template-based memes
but fall short when applied to non-template-based meme formats. However, the
segment-wise approach was found to consistently outperform the whole-image
measures on matching non-template-based memes. Finally, we explore a
prompting-based approach using a pretrained Multimodal Large Language Model for
meme matching. Our results highlight that accurately matching memes via shared
visual elements, not just background templates, remains an open challenge that
requires more sophisticated matching techniques.

TL;DR: 提出了一种针对农村历史地图的可扩展高效管道，通过分层机器学习方法提取建筑足迹，验证了其高性能和效率，并发现了一个可能在大饥荒时期被废弃的定居点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 历史地图是研究过去景观和定居模式的重要资源，但现有方法多集中于城市且计算量大，难以适用于农村地区。

Method: 采用分层机器学习方法：先用CNN分类器过滤掉不含建筑的地图区域，再用CNN分割算法提取剩余区域的建筑特征。

Result: 在爱尔兰历史地图系列上验证，性能高效，并发现了一个1839年存在但1899年消失的定居点。

Conclusion: 该方法为农村历史地图分析提供了高效工具，有助于历史和考古发现。

Abstract: Historical maps offer a valuable lens through which to study past landscapes
and settlement patterns. While prior research has leveraged machine learning
based techniques to extract building footprints from historical maps, such
approaches have largely focused on urban areas and tend to be computationally
intensive. This presents a challenge for research questions requiring analysis
across extensive rural regions, such as verifying historical census data or
locating abandoned settlements. In this paper, this limitation is addressed by
proposing a scalable and efficient pipeline tailored to rural maps with sparse
building distributions. The method described employs a hierarchical machine
learning based approach: convolutional neural network (CNN) classifiers are
first used to progressively filter out map sections unlikely to contain
buildings, significantly reducing the area requiring detailed analysis. The
remaining high probability sections are then processed using CNN segmentation
algorithms to extract building features. The pipeline is validated using test
sections from the Ordnance Survey Ireland historical 25 inch map series and 6
inch map series, demonstrating both high performance and improved efficiency
compared to conventional segmentation-only approaches. Application of the
technique to both map series, covering the same geographic region, highlights
its potential for historical and archaeological discovery. Notably, the
pipeline identified a settlement of approximately 22 buildings in Tully, Co.
Galway, present in the 6 inch map, produced in 1839, but absent from the 25
inch map, produced in 1899, suggesting it may have been abandoned during the
Great Famine period.

Abstract: Recent studies have highlighted the potential of adapting the Segment
Anything Model (SAM) for various downstream tasks. However, constructing a more
powerful and generalizable encoder to further enhance performance remains an
open challenge. In this work, we propose SAM2-UNeXT, an advanced framework that
builds upon the core principles of SAM2-UNet while extending the
representational capacity of SAM2 through the integration of an auxiliary
DINOv2 encoder. By incorporating a dual-resolution strategy and a dense glue
layer, our approach enables more accurate segmentation with a simple
architecture, relaxing the need for complex decoder designs. Extensive
experiments conducted on four benchmarks, including dichotomous image
segmentation, camouflaged object detection, marine animal segmentation, and
remote sensing saliency detection, demonstrate the superior performance of our
proposed method. The code is available at

TL;DR: RadProPoser是一种基于雷达的隐私保护人体姿态估计系统，通过概率编码器-解码器架构处理复杂雷达数据，并量化关节位置的不确定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 雷达姿态估计具有隐私保护和光照不变性优势，但受噪声和多径效应影响，需解决数据不确定性建模问题。

Method: 采用变分推断和概率编码器-解码器架构，处理3发4收MIMO雷达数据，预测3D关节位置及不确定性。

Result: 在光学动捕数据集上，平均关节位置误差6.425 cm，不确定性校准误差0.021，数据增强提升下游任务F1至0.870。

Conclusion: RadProPoser首次实现端到端雷达姿态估计及不确定性建模，为可靠的人体运动分析奠定基础。

Abstract: Radar-based human pose estimation (HPE) provides a privacy-preserving,
illumination-invariant sensing modality but is challenged by noisy,
multipath-affected measurements. We introduce RadProPoser, a probabilistic
encoder-decoder architecture that processes complex-valued radar tensors from a
compact 3-transmitter, 4-receiver MIMO radar. By incorporating variational
inference into keypoint regression, RadProPoser jointly predicts 26
three-dimensional joint locations alongside heteroscedastic aleatoric
uncertainties and can be recalibrated to predict total uncertainty. We explore
different probabilistic formulations using both Gaussian and Laplace
distributions for latent priors and likelihoods. On our newly released dataset
with optical motion-capture ground truth, RadProPoser achieves an overall mean
per-joint position error (MPJPE) of 6.425 cm, with 5.678 cm at the 45 degree
aspect angle. The learned uncertainties exhibit strong alignment with actual
pose errors and can be calibrated to produce reliable prediction intervals,
with our best configuration achieving an expected calibration error of 0.021.
As an additional demonstration, sampling from these latent distributions
enables effective data augmentation for downstream activity classification,
resulting in an F1 score of 0.870. To our knowledge, this is the first
end-to-end radar tensor-based HPE system to explicitly model and quantify
per-joint uncertainty from raw radar tensor data, establishing a foundation for
explainable and reliable human motion analysis in radar applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 云层和夜间条件限制了多光谱卫星图像的可用性和可靠性，而Sentinel-1雷达数据不受这些条件影响。

Method: 采用基于条件潜在流匹配的多阶段训练方法，并首次将余弦调度与流匹配结合。

Result: CloudBreaker在生成的光学图像中表现出高保真度（FID为0.7432），NDWI和NDVI的结构相似性指数分别为0.6156和0.6874。

Conclusion: CloudBreaker为多光谱数据不可靠或不可用的遥感应用提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: Cloud cover and nighttime conditions remain significant limitations in
satellite-based remote sensing, often restricting the availability and
usability of multi-spectral imagery. In contrast, Sentinel-1 radar images are
unaffected by cloud cover and can provide consistent data regardless of weather
or lighting conditions. To address the challenges of limited satellite imagery,
we propose CloudBreaker, a novel framework that generates high-quality
multi-spectral Sentinel-2 signals from Sentinel-1 data. This includes the
reconstruction of optical (RGB) images as well as critical vegetation and water
indices such as NDVI and NDWI.We employed a novel multi-stage training approach
based on conditional latent flow matching and, to the best of our knowledge,
are the first to integrate cosine scheduling with flow matching. CloudBreaker
demonstrates strong performance, achieving a Frechet Inception Distance (FID)
score of 0.7432, indicating high fidelity and realism in the generated optical
imagery. The model also achieved Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) of
0.6156 for NDWI and 0.6874 for NDVI, indicating a high degree of structural
similarity. This establishes CloudBreaker as a promising solution for a wide
range of remote sensing applications where multi-spectral data is typically
unavailable or unreliable

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 事件相机具有高动态范围和微秒级延迟的特性，但现有方法在利用其时空动态信息进行人脸表情识别时表现不佳，因此需要一种更有效的方法。

Method: 提出evTransFER框架，使用对抗生成方法预训练特征提取器（用于面部重建任务），然后迁移到表情识别系统；结合LSTM捕捉长期动态，并引入新的事件表示TIE。

Result: 在e-CK+数据库上达到93.6%的识别率，比现有方法提升至少25.9个百分点。

Conclusion: evTransFER通过迁移学习和改进的架构显著提升了事件相机在人脸表情识别中的性能。

Abstract: Event-based cameras are bio-inspired vision sensors that asynchronously
capture per-pixel intensity changes with microsecond latency, high temporal
resolution, and high dynamic range, providing valuable information about the
spatio-temporal dynamics of the scene. In the present work, we propose
evTransFER, a transfer learning-based framework and architecture for face
expression recognition using event-based cameras. The main contribution is a
feature extractor designed to encode the spatio-temporal dynamics of faces,
built by training an adversarial generative method on a different problem
(facial reconstruction) and then transferring the trained encoder weights to
the face expression recognition system. We show that this proposed transfer
learning method greatly improves the ability to recognize facial expressions
compared to training a network from scratch. In addition, we propose an
architecture that incorporates an LSTM to capture longer-term facial expression
dynamics, and we introduce a new event-based representation, referred to as
TIE, both of which further improve the results. We evaluate the proposed
framework on the event-based facial expression database e-CK+ and compare it to
state-of-the-art methods. The results show that the proposed framework
evTransFER achieves a 93.6\% recognition rate on the e-CK+ database,
significantly improving the accuracy (25.9\% points or more) when compared to
state-of-the-art performance for similar problems.

Abstract: We introduce FPG-NAS, a FLOPs-aware Gated Differentiable Neural Architecture
Search framework for efficient 6DoF object pose estimation. Estimating 3D
rotation and translation from a single image has been widely investigated yet
remains computationally demanding, limiting applicability in
resource-constrained scenarios. FPG-NAS addresses this by proposing a
specialized differentiable NAS approach for 6DoF pose estimation, featuring a
task-specific search space and a differentiable gating mechanism that enables
discrete multi-candidate operator selection, thus improving architectural
diversity. Additionally, a FLOPs regularization term ensures a balanced
trade-off between accuracy and efficiency. The framework explores a vast search
space of approximately 10\textsuperscript{92} possible architectures.
Experiments on the LINEMOD and SPEED+ datasets demonstrate that FPG-NAS-derived
models outperform previous methods under strict FLOPs constraints. To the best
of our knowledge, FPG-NAS is the first differentiable NAS framework
specifically designed for 6DoF object pose estimation.

Motivation: 传统方法在3D场景重建中常将语义理解与重建分离，或需昂贵的逐场景优化，限制了其扩展性和泛化性。

Method: Uni3R利用跨视图Transformer整合多视图信息，回归一组带有语义特征场的3D高斯基元，实现统一表示。

Result: Uni3R在多个基准测试中表现优异，如RE10K的25.07 PSNR和ScanNet的55.84 mIoU。

Conclusion: Uni3R为可泛化的统一3D场景重建和理解提供了新范式。

Abstract: Reconstructing and semantically interpreting 3D scenes from sparse 2D views
remains a fundamental challenge in computer vision. Conventional methods often
decouple semantic understanding from reconstruction or necessitate costly
per-scene optimization, thereby restricting their scalability and
generalizability. In this paper, we introduce Uni3R, a novel feed-forward
framework that jointly reconstructs a unified 3D scene representation enriched
with open-vocabulary semantics, directly from unposed multi-view images. Our
approach leverages a Cross-View Transformer to robustly integrate information
across arbitrary multi-view inputs, which then regresses a set of 3D Gaussian
primitives endowed with semantic feature fields. This unified representation
facilitates high-fidelity novel view synthesis, open-vocabulary 3D semantic
segmentation, and depth prediction, all within a single, feed-forward pass.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that Uni3R establishes a new state-of-the-art
across multiple benchmarks, including 25.07 PSNR on RE10K and 55.84 mIoU on
ScanNet. Our work signifies a novel paradigm towards generalizable, unified 3D

completion can be decoupled into two multi-modal distributions: one capturing
how measurements project into a normalized object reference frame defined by
the dataset and the other modelling a prior over object geometries represented
as triplanar neural fields. By training separate conditional diffusion models
for these two distributions, we enable sampling multiple hypotheses from the
joint pose and shape distribution. OmniShape demonstrates compelling
performance on challenging real world datasets. Project website:

TL;DR: Veila提出了一种基于条件扩散框架的方法，通过RGB图像生成可控的全景LiDAR数据，解决了现有方法在可控性和跨模态对齐上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在生成全景LiDAR数据时缺乏可控性或依赖文本引导，难以实现细粒度空间控制。利用RGB图像作为控制信号是一种低成本且可扩展的替代方案，但面临语义与深度信息不一致、模态差异和结构一致性等挑战。

Method: Veila框架包含三个核心组件：置信感知条件机制（CACM）动态平衡语义与深度信息；几何跨模态对齐（GCMA）在噪声扩散下保持RGB-LiDAR对齐；全景特征一致性（PFC）确保全局结构一致性。

Result: 在nuScenes、SemanticKITTI和KITTI-Weather基准测试中，Veila在生成保真度和跨模态一致性上达到最优，并能通过生成数据增强提升下游LiDAR语义分割性能。

Conclusion: Veila通过创新的条件扩散框架，成功解决了RGB图像引导下全景LiDAR数据生成的挑战，为自动驾驶和机器人领域的3D感知提供了可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Realistic and controllable panoramic LiDAR data generation is critical for
scalable 3D perception in autonomous driving and robotics. Existing methods
either perform unconditional generation with poor controllability or adopt
text-guided synthesis, which lacks fine-grained spatial control. Leveraging a
monocular RGB image as a spatial control signal offers a scalable and low-cost
alternative, which remains an open problem. However, it faces three core
challenges: (i) semantic and depth cues from RGB are vary spatially,
complicating reliable conditioning generation; (ii) modality gaps between RGB
appearance and LiDAR geometry amplify alignment errors under noisy diffusion;
and (iii) maintaining structural coherence between monocular RGB and panoramic
LiDAR is challenging, particularly in non-overlap regions between images and
LiDAR. To address these challenges, we propose Veila, a novel conditional
diffusion framework that integrates: a Confidence-Aware Conditioning Mechanism
(CACM) that strengthens RGB conditioning by adaptively balancing semantic and
depth cues according to their local reliability; a Geometric Cross-Modal
Alignment (GCMA) for robust RGB-LiDAR alignment under noisy diffusion; and a
Panoramic Feature Coherence (PFC) for enforcing global structural consistency
across monocular RGB and panoramic LiDAR. Additionally, we introduce two
metrics, Cross-Modal Semantic Consistency and Cross-Modal Depth Consistency, to
evaluate alignment quality across modalities. Experiments on nuScenes,
SemanticKITTI, and our proposed KITTI-Weather benchmark demonstrate that Veila
achieves state-of-the-art generation fidelity and cross-modal consistency,
while enabling generative data augmentation that improves downstream LiDAR
semantic segmentation.

Conclusion: La La LiDAR为可控3D场景生成设定了新基准。

Abstract: Controllable generation of realistic LiDAR scenes is crucial for applications
such as autonomous driving and robotics. While recent diffusion-based models
achieve high-fidelity LiDAR generation, they lack explicit control over
foreground objects and spatial relationships, limiting their usefulness for
scenario simulation and safety validation. To address these limitations, we
propose Large-scale Layout-guided LiDAR generation model ("La La LiDAR"), a
novel layout-guided generative framework that introduces semantic-enhanced
scene graph diffusion with relation-aware contextual conditioning for
structured LiDAR layout generation, followed by foreground-aware control
injection for complete scene generation. This enables customizable control over
object placement while ensuring spatial and semantic consistency. To support
our structured LiDAR generation, we introduce Waymo-SG and nuScenes-SG, two
large-scale LiDAR scene graph datasets, along with new evaluation metrics for
layout synthesis. Extensive experiments demonstrate that La La LiDAR achieves
state-of-the-art performance in both LiDAR generation and downstream perception
tasks, establishing a new benchmark for controllable 3D scene generation.

Abstract: Generative world models have become essential data engines for autonomous
driving, yet most existing efforts focus on videos or occupancy grids,
overlooking the unique LiDAR properties. Extending LiDAR generation to dynamic
4D world modeling presents challenges in controllability, temporal coherence,
and evaluation standardization. To this end, we present LiDARCrafter, a unified
framework for 4D LiDAR generation and editing. Given free-form natural language
inputs, we parse instructions into ego-centric scene graphs, which condition a
tri-branch diffusion network to generate object structures, motion
trajectories, and geometry. These structured conditions enable diverse and
fine-grained scene editing. Additionally, an autoregressive module generates
temporally coherent 4D LiDAR sequences with smooth transitions. To support
standardized evaluation, we establish a comprehensive benchmark with diverse
metrics spanning scene-, object-, and sequence-level aspects. Experiments on
the nuScenes dataset using this benchmark demonstrate that LiDARCrafter
achieves state-of-the-art performance in fidelity, controllability, and
temporal consistency across all levels, paving the way for data augmentation

Result: 实验表明LongVie在长范围可控性、一致性和质量上达到最优性能。

Conclusion: LongVie通过创新设计解决了超长视频生成的挑战，并提出了新的基准测试LongVGenBench。

Abstract: Controllable ultra-long video generation is a fundamental yet challenging
task. Although existing methods are effective for short clips, they struggle to
scale due to issues such as temporal inconsistency and visual degradation. In
this paper, we initially investigate and identify three key factors: separate
noise initialization, independent control signal normalization, and the
limitations of single-modality guidance. To address these issues, we propose
LongVie, an end-to-end autoregressive framework for controllable long video
generation. LongVie introduces two core designs to ensure temporal consistency:
1) a unified noise initialization strategy that maintains consistent generation
across clips, and 2) global control signal normalization that enforces
alignment in the control space throughout the entire video. To mitigate visual
degradation, LongVie employs 3) a multi-modal control framework that integrates
both dense (e.g., depth maps) and sparse (e.g., keypoints) control signals,
complemented by 4) a degradation-aware training strategy that adaptively
balances modality contributions over time to preserve visual quality. We also
introduce LongVGenBench, a comprehensive benchmark consisting of 100
high-resolution videos spanning diverse real-world and synthetic environments,
each lasting over one minute. Extensive experiments show that LongVie achieves
state-of-the-art performance in long-range controllability, consistency, and
quality.

TL;DR: Trokens提出了一种将轨迹点转化为语义感知关系标记的新方法，通过语义感知采样和运动建模框架，显著提升了少样本动作识别的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频理解需要有效建模运动和外观信息，但现有方法在轨迹点选择和运动模式建模上存在挑战。

Method: 采用语义感知采样策略和基于HoD的运动建模框架，结合轨迹标记与语义特征。

Result: 在六个少样本动作识别基准测试中达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: Trokens通过结合语义和运动信息，显著提升了动作识别的效果。

Abstract: Video understanding requires effective modeling of both motion and appearance
information, particularly for few-shot action recognition. While recent
advances in point tracking have been shown to improve few-shot action
recognition, two fundamental challenges persist: selecting informative points
to track and effectively modeling their motion patterns. We present Trokens, a
novel approach that transforms trajectory points into semantic-aware relational
tokens for action recognition. First, we introduce a semantic-aware sampling
strategy to adaptively distribute tracking points based on object scale and
semantic relevance. Second, we develop a motion modeling framework that
captures both intra-trajectory dynamics through the Histogram of Oriented
Displacements (HoD) and inter-trajectory relationships to model complex action
patterns. Our approach effectively combines these trajectory tokens with
semantic features to enhance appearance features with motion information,
achieving state-of-the-art performance across six diverse few-shot action
recognition benchmarks: Something-Something-V2 (both full and small splits),
Kinetics, UCF101, HMDB51, and FineGym. For project page see

TL;DR: READ是一个基于扩散-Transformer的实时说话头生成框架，通过压缩视频和语音潜在空间以及异步噪声调度器，显著提高了生成速度和质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在说话头生成中取得了进展，但推理速度慢限制了实际应用。

Method: 使用时间VAE压缩视频潜在空间，SpeechAE生成语音潜在代码，A2V-DiT建模，异步噪声调度器（ANS）确保一致性。

Result: READ在质量和速度上优于现有方法，实现了长时间生成的稳定性。

Conclusion: READ在说话头生成中实现了速度与质量的平衡，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: The introduction of diffusion models has brought significant advances to the
field of audio-driven talking head generation. However, the extremely slow
inference speed severely limits the practical implementation of diffusion-based
talking head generation models. In this study, we propose READ, the first
real-time diffusion-transformer-based talking head generation framework. Our
approach first learns a spatiotemporal highly compressed video latent space via
a temporal VAE, significantly reducing the token count to accelerate
generation. To achieve better audio-visual alignment within this compressed
latent space, a pre-trained Speech Autoencoder (SpeechAE) is proposed to
generate temporally compressed speech latent codes corresponding to the video
latent space. These latent representations are then modeled by a carefully
designed Audio-to-Video Diffusion Transformer (A2V-DiT) backbone for efficient
talking head synthesis. Furthermore, to ensure temporal consistency and
accelerated inference in extended generation, we propose a novel asynchronous
noise scheduler (ANS) for both the training and inference process of our
framework. The ANS leverages asynchronous add-noise and asynchronous
motion-guided generation in the latent space, ensuring consistency in generated
video clips. Experimental results demonstrate that READ outperforms
state-of-the-art methods by generating competitive talking head videos with
significantly reduced runtime, achieving an optimal balance between quality and
speed while maintaining robust metric stability in long-time generation.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于Foundation-Expert范式的方法，用于高效部署超大规模推荐系统，解决了在线流数据学习、多任务适应性和延迟约束等挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 推荐系统在超大规模模型部署方面面临独特挑战，如在线流数据学习、数据分布变化和多任务适应性，需要一种高效且计算友好的解决方案。

Method: 采用Foundation-Expert范式，通过中心化基础模型学习通用知识，再通过目标感知嵌入将其高效转移到轻量级专家模型中。

Result: 该方法已在Meta部署，每天处理数百亿用户请求，性能优于之前的单阶段生产系统，同时提升了开发效率和基础设施效率。

Conclusion: Foundation-Expert范式为推荐系统实现规模化提供了计算高效且开发友好的蓝图，首次成功应用于超大规模场景。

Abstract: While scaling laws promise significant performance gains for recommender
systems, efficiently deploying hyperscale models remains a major unsolved
challenge. In contrast to fields where FMs are already widely adopted such as
natural language processing and computer vision, progress in recommender
systems is hindered by unique challenges including the need to learn from
online streaming data under shifting data distributions, the need to adapt to
different recommendation surfaces with a wide diversity in their downstream
tasks and their input distributions, and stringent latency and computational
constraints. To bridge this gap, we propose to leverage the Foundation-Expert
Paradigm: a framework designed for the development and deployment of hyperscale
recommendation FMs. In our approach, a central FM is trained on lifelong,
cross-surface, multi-modal user data to learn generalizable knowledge. This
knowledge is then efficiently transferred to various lightweight,
surface-specific ``expert" models via target-aware embeddings, allowing them to
adapt to local data distributions and optimization goals with minimal overhead.
To meet our training, inference and development needs, we built HyperCast, a
production-grade infrastructure system that re-engineers training, serving,
logging and iteration to power this decoupled paradigm. Our approach is now
deployed at Meta serving tens of billions of user requests daily, demonstrating
online metric improvements over our previous one-stage production system while
improving developer velocity and maintaining infrastructure efficiency. To the
best of our knowledge, this work represents the first successful deployment of
a Foundation-Expert paradigm at this scale, offering a proven,
compute-efficient, and developer-friendly blueprint to realize the promise of
scaling laws in recommender systems.

Motivation: 银行监管者需要确保新措施与历史先例一致，但任务复杂，因此需要一种高效的信息检索系统辅助决策。

Method: 系统结合了词汇、语义和模糊集匹配技术，并通过蒙特卡洛方法验证性能，最终使用Transformer去噪自编码器优化模型。

Conclusion: 该信息检索系统能有效辅助监管者制定一致且高效的措施，性能显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Bank supervisors face the complex task of ensuring that new measures are
consistently aligned with historical precedents. To address this challenge, we
introduce a novel Information Retrieval (IR) System tailored to assist
supervisors in drafting both consistent and effective measures. This system
ingests findings from on-site investigations. It then retrieves the most
relevant historical findings and their associated measures from a comprehensive
database, providing a solid basis for supervisors to write well-informed
measures for new findings. Utilizing a blend of lexical, semantic, and Capital
Requirements Regulation (CRR) fuzzy set matching techniques, the IR system
ensures the retrieval of findings that closely align with current cases. The
performance of this system, particularly in scenarios with partially labeled
data, is validated through a Monte Carlo methodology, showcasing its robustness
and accuracy. Enhanced by a Transformer-based Denoising AutoEncoder for
fine-tuning, the final model achieves a Mean Average Precision (MAP@100) of
0.83 and a Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR@100) of 0.92. These scores surpass those
of both standalone lexical models such as BM25 and semantic BERT-like models.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有向量搜索库（如Faiss和DiskANN）主要针对x86 CPU架构优化，而华为鲲鹏CPU基于ARM架构且计算能力强，需要专门优化的解决方案。

Method: KBest采用SIMD加速距离计算、数据预取、索引优化、早期终止和向量量化等技术。

Result: 实验显示，KBest在查询吞吐量上优于x86 CPU上的现有库，优化后性能提升超过2倍。

Conclusion: KBest已成功应用于内部业务和外部企业客户，每日处理数千万查询。

Abstract: Vector search, which returns the vectors most similar to a given query vector
from a large vector dataset, underlies many important applications such as
search, recommendation, and LLMs. To be economic, vector search needs to be
efficient to reduce the resources required by a given query workload. However,
existing vector search libraries (e.g., Faiss and DiskANN) are optimized for
x86 CPU architectures (i.e., Intel and AMD CPUs) while Huawei Kunpeng CPUs are
based on the ARM architecture and competitive in compute power. In this paper,
we present KBest as a vector search library tailored for the latest Kunpeng 920
CPUs. To be efficient, KBest incorporates extensive hardware-aware and
algorithmic optimizations, which include single-instruction-multiple-data
(SIMD) accelerated distance computation, data prefetch, index refinement, early
termination, and vector quantization. Experiment results show that KBest
outperforms SOTA vector search libraries running on x86 CPUs, and our
optimizations can improve the query throughput by over 2x. Currently, KBest
serves applications from both our internal business and external enterprise
clients with tens of millions of queries on a daily basis.

TL;DR: ADSeeker通过知识驱动的推理和新的数据集MulA，提升了工业视觉检测中多模态大语言模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业视觉检测中，多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）表现不及人类专家，主要因缺乏异常检测知识和技术精确的语言生成。

Method: 提出ADSeeker，结合SEEK-M&V知识库和Q2K RAG框架，利用Hierarchical Sparse Prompt和MulA数据集提升性能。

Result: ADSeeker在多个基准数据集上实现了零样本检测的最先进性能。

Conclusion: ADSeeker为工业异常检测提供了一种高效的知识驱动解决方案。

Abstract: Automatic vision inspection holds significant importance in industry
inspection. While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) exhibit strong
language understanding capabilities and hold promise for this task, their
performance remains significantly inferior to that of human experts. In this
context, we identify two key challenges: (i) insufficient integration of
anomaly detection (AD) knowledge during pre-training, and (ii) the lack of
technically precise and conte-aware language generation for anomaly reasoning.
To address these issues, we propose ADSeeker, an anomaly task assistant
designed to enhance inspection performance through knowledge-grounded
reasoning. ADSeeker leverages a curated visual document knowledge base,
SEEK-MVTec&VisA (SEEK-M&V), which we construct to address the limitations of
existing resources that rely solely on unstructured text. SEEK-M&V includes
semantic-rich descriptions and image-document pairs, enabling more
comprehensive anomaly understanding. To effectively retrieve and utilize this
knowledge, we introduce the Query Image-Knowledge Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (Q2K RAG) framework. To further enhance the performance in zero-shot
anomaly detection (ZSAD), ADSeeker leverages the Hierarchical Sparse Prompt
mechanism and type-level features to efficiently extract anomaly patterns.
Furthermore, to tackle the challenge of limited in industry anomaly detection
(IAD) data, we introduce the largest-scale AD dataset, Multi-type Anomaly
(MulA), encompassing 72 multi-scale defect types across 26 Categories.
Extensive experiments show that our plug-and-play framework, ADSeeker, achieves
state-of-the-art zero-shot performance on several benchmark datasets.

Conclusion: DDSRec有效平衡了序列推荐的准确性与多样性。

Abstract: Sequential recommendation predicts user preferences over time and has
achieved remarkable success. However, the growing length of user interaction
sequences and the complex entanglement of evolving user interests and
intentions introduce significant challenges to diversity. To address these, we
propose a model-agnostic Dual-disentangle framework for Diversified Sequential
Recommendation (DDSRec). The framework refines user interest and intention
modeling by adopting disentangling perspectives in interaction modeling and
representation learning, thereby balancing accuracy and diversity in sequential
recommendations. Extensive experiments on multiple public datasets demonstrate
the effectiveness and superiority of DDSRec in terms of accuracy and diversity
for sequential recommendations.

Motivation: 低精度计算在检索系统中广泛用于提升效率，但会导致并列问题，增加结果的不确定性，影响评估的可靠性。

Method: 提出HPS（在最终评分步骤中提升精度以解决并列）和TRM（量化并列候选的顺序不确定性）。

Result: 实验表明HPS显著减少并列引起的不稳定性，TRM能准确恢复预期指标值。

Conclusion: HPS和TRM的组合为低精度检索提供了更一致和可靠的评估系统。

Abstract: Lowering the numerical precision of model parameters and computations is
widely adopted to improve the efficiency of retrieval systems. However, when
computing relevance scores between the query and documents in low-precision, we
observe spurious ties due to the reduced granularity. This introduces high
variability in the results based on tie resolution, making the evaluation less
reliable. To address this, we propose a more robust retrieval evaluation
protocol designed to reduce score variation. It consists of: (1) High-Precision
Scoring (HPS), which upcasts the final scoring step to higher precision to
resolve tied candidates with minimal computational cost; and (2) Tie-aware
Retrieval Metrics (TRM), which report expected scores, range, and bias to
quantify order uncertainty of tied candidates. Our experiments test multiple
models with three scoring functions on two retrieval datasets to demonstrate
that HPS dramatically reduces tie-induced instability, and TRM accurately
recovers expected metric values. This combination enables a more consistent and
reliable evaluation system for lower-precision retrievals.

Motivation: 现代推荐系统中，用户和物品的表示通常由两个独立的神经网络生成，而多模态表示学习中权重共享已被证明有效。受此启发，研究旨在通过权重共享优化推荐系统。

Method: 提出CoBraR框架，采用单一协作分支（Collaborative Branch for Recommendation），在共享嵌入空间中实现用户和物品神经网络的权重共享。

Result: 在电商和电影推荐实验中，CoBraR减少了参数数量，提升了非准确性指标，且未影响准确性。

Conclusion: CoBraR具有在实际场景中应用和扩展的潜力。

Abstract: Recommender Systems (RS) often rely on representations of users and items in
a joint embedding space and on a similarity metric to compute relevance scores.
In modern RS, the modules to obtain user and item representations consist of
two distinct and separate neural networks (NN). In multimodal representation
learning, weight sharing has been proven effective in reducing the distance
between multiple modalities of a same item. Inspired by these approaches, we
propose a novel RS that leverages weight sharing between the user and item NN
modules used to obtain the latent representations in the shared embedding
space. The proposed framework consists of a single Collaborative Branch for
Recommendation (CoBraR). We evaluate CoBraR by means of quantitative
experiments on e-commerce and movie recommendation. Our experiments show that
by reducing the number of parameters and improving beyond-accuracy aspects
without compromising accuracy, CoBraR has the potential to be applied and
extended for real-world scenarios.

Conclusion: MultiRAG通过知识引导方法有效解决了多源RAG中的幻觉问题，为复杂场景下的知识检索提供了可靠框架。

Abstract: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a promising solution to
address hallucination issues in Large Language Models (LLMs). However, the
integration of multiple retrieval sources, while potentially more informative,
introduces new challenges that can paradoxically exacerbate hallucination
problems. These challenges manifest primarily in two aspects: the sparse
distribution of multi-source data that hinders the capture of logical
relationships and the inherent inconsistencies among different sources that
lead to information conflicts. To address these challenges, we propose
MultiRAG, a novel framework designed to mitigate hallucination in multi-source
retrieval-augmented generation through knowledge-guided approaches. Our
framework introduces two key innovations: (1) a knowledge construction module
that employs multi-source line graphs to efficiently aggregate logical
relationships across different knowledge sources, effectively addressing the
sparse data distribution issue; and (2) a sophisticated retrieval module that
implements a multi-level confidence calculation mechanism, performing both
graph-level and node-level assessments to identify and eliminate unreliable
information nodes, thereby reducing hallucinations caused by inter-source
inconsistencies. Extensive experiments on four multi-domain query datasets and
two multi-hop QA datasets demonstrate that MultiRAG significantly enhances the
reliability and efficiency of knowledge retrieval in complex multi-source
scenarios. \textcolor{blue}{Our code is available in

Motivation: 单向量搜索在信息检索中存在局限性，尤其是在跨领域、长上下文和复杂推理任务中表现不佳。多向量方法（如ColBERT）虽具有优势，但缺乏易用的工具支持其训练和实验。

Method: 通过开发PyLate库，继承Sentence Transformers的高效训练和模块化功能，支持多向量架构，并提供高效索引等特性。

Conclusion: PyLate填补了多向量模型工具链的空白，有望推动晚期交互模型在现代信息检索系统中的广泛应用。

Abstract: Neural ranking has become a cornerstone of modern information retrieval.
While single vector search remains the dominant paradigm, it suffers from the
shortcoming of compressing all the information into a single vector. This
compression leads to notable performance degradation in out-of-domain,
long-context, and reasoning-intensive retrieval tasks. Multi-vector approaches
pioneered by ColBERT aim to address these limitations by preserving individual
token embeddings and computing similarity via the MaxSim operator. This
architecture has demonstrated superior empirical advantages, including enhanced
out-of-domain generalization, long-context handling, and performance in complex
retrieval scenarios. Despite these compelling empirical results and clear
theoretical advantages, the practical adoption and public availability of late
interaction models remain low compared to their single-vector counterparts,
primarily due to a lack of accessible and modular tools for training and
experimenting with such models. To bridge this gap, we introduce PyLate, a
streamlined library built on top of Sentence Transformers to support
multi-vector architectures natively, inheriting its efficient training,
advanced logging, and automated model card generation while requiring minimal
code changes to code templates users are already familiar with. By offering
multi-vector-specific features such as efficient indexes, PyLate aims to
accelerate research and real-world application of late interaction models,
thereby unlocking their full potential in modern IR systems. Finally, PyLate
has already enabled the development of state-of-the-art models, including
GTE-ModernColBERT and Reason-ModernColBERT, demonstrating its practical utility
for both research and production environments.

Abstract: Sequential Recommender Systems (SRSs) have demonstrated remarkable
effectiveness in capturing users' evolving preferences. However, their inherent
complexity as "black box" models poses significant challenges for
explainability. This work presents the first counterfactual explanation
technique specifically developed for SRSs, introducing a novel approach in this
space, addressing the key question: What minimal changes in a user's
interaction history would lead to different recommendations? To achieve this,
we introduce a specialized genetic algorithm tailored for discrete sequences
and show that generating counterfactual explanations for sequential data is an
NP-Complete problem. We evaluate these approaches across four experimental
settings, varying between targeted-untargeted and categorized-uncategorized
scenarios, to comprehensively assess their capability in generating meaningful
explanations. Using three different datasets and three models, we are able to
demonstrate that our methods successfully generate interpretable counterfactual
explanation while maintaining model fidelity close to one. Our findings
contribute to the growing field of Explainable AI by providing a framework for
understanding sequential recommendation decisions through the lens of "what-if"
scenarios, ultimately enhancing user trust and system transparency.

Method: 采用两步LLM蒸馏过程，从LLM教师模型通过交叉编码器助理蒸馏到双编码器学生模型，结合多任务训练。

Result: 实验表明，该方法提升了双编码器在eBay广告关键词推荐中的相关性检索性能。

Conclusion: 通过LLM知识蒸馏和多任务训练，可以有效优化广告关键词推荐系统的性能。

Abstract: Sellers at eBay are recommended keyphrases to bid on to enhance the
performance of their advertising campaigns. The relevance of these keyphrases
is crucial in avoiding the overcrowding of search systems with irrelevant items
and maintaining a positive seller perception. It is essential that keyphrase
recommendations align with both seller and Search judgments regarding auctions.
Due to the difficulty in procuring negative human judgment at scale, employing
LLM-as-a-judge to mimic seller judgment has been established as the norm in
several studies. This study introduces a novel two-step LLM distillation
process from a LLM-judge used to debias our Embedding Based Retrieval (EBR)
model from the various biases that exist in click-data. We distill from an LLM
teacher via a cross-encoder assistant into a bi-encoder student using a
multi-task training approach, ultimately employing the student bi-encoder to
retrieve relevant advertiser keyphrases. We show that integrating a knowledge
distillation process from LLMs in a multi-task training setup enhances
bi-encoder performance in retrieving relevant advertiser keyphrases at eBay.

feature groups: collection characteristics, user-collection similarity, and
contextual information. To address the cold-start problem of recommending newly
created collections, we develop content-based representations using item
embeddings and implement monotonicity constraints to improve generalization. We
tackle data scarcity by bootstrapping from category carousel interactions and
address visibility bias through unbiased sampling of impressions and purchases
in production. The system demonstrates significant real-world impact through
extensive A/B testing with 5-10% of iFood's user base. Online results of our
A/B tests add up to 97% improvement in Card Conversion Rate and 1.4% increase
in overall App Conversion Rate compared to popularity-based baselines. Notably,
our offline accuracy metrics strongly correlate with online performance,
enabling reliable impact prediction before deployment. To our knowledge, this
is the first work to detail large-scale recommendation of curated food
collections in a dynamic commercial environment.

### [145] [A Bayesian Hybrid Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning Method for Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02711)
*Yidong Chai,Yang Liu,Yonghang Zhou,Jiaheng Xie,Daniel Dajun Zeng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为BH-PEFT的新方法，将贝叶斯学习融入混合参数高效微调（PEFT）中，解决了现有方法在不确定性量化和动态适应数据方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）在专业应用中需要领域特定的微调，但现有混合PEFT方法缺乏不确定性量化和动态适应能力。

Method: 提出BH-PEFT方法，结合Adapter、LoRA和prefix-tuning技术，通过贝叶斯学习建模参数分布，并引入动态微调机制。

Result: 在情感分析、新闻分类等任务中，BH-PEFT优于现有PEFT基线，支持不确定性量化和动态适应。

Conclusion: BH-PEFT为商业分析和数据科学提供了不确定性感知和自适应决策支持的新方法。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated transformative potential in
reshaping the world. As these models are pretrained on general corpora, they
often require domain-specific fine-tuning to optimize performance in
specialized business applications. Due to their massive scale,
parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods are widely used to reduce
training costs. Among them, hybrid PEFT methods that combine multiple PEFT
techniques have achieved the best performance. However, existing hybrid PEFT
methods face two main challenges when fine-tuning LLMs for specialized
applications: (1) relying on point estimates, lacking the ability to quantify
uncertainty for reliable decision-making, and (2) struggling to dynamically
adapt to emerging data, lacking the ability to suit real-world situations. We
propose Bayesian Hybrid Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (BH-PEFT), a novel
method that integrates Bayesian learning into hybrid PEFT. BH-PEFT combines
Adapter, LoRA, and prefix-tuning to fine-tune feedforward and attention layers
of the Transformer. By modeling learnable parameters as distributions, BH-PEFT
enables uncertainty quantification. We further propose a Bayesian dynamic
fine-tuning approach where the last posterior serves as the prior for the next
round, enabling effective adaptation to new data. We evaluated BH-PEFT on
business tasks such as sentiment analysis, news categorization, and commonsense
reasoning. Results show that our method outperforms existing PEFT baselines,
enables uncertainty quantification for more reliable decisions, and improves
adaptability in dynamic scenarios. This work contributes to business analytics
and data science by proposing a novel BH-PEFT method and dynamic fine-tuning
approach that support uncertainty-aware and adaptive decision-making in
real-world situations.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种统一的数学框架，确保深度神经网络的雅可比矩阵几乎处处正交，从而解决梯度消失或爆炸问题，提升训练效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络训练中梯度消失或爆炸问题限制了模型的性能，现有方法如正交初始化或残差结构虽有效但仍有改进空间。

Method: 引入一个数学框架，设计非线性前馈和残差网络，使其雅可比矩阵几乎处处正交，实现动态等距性。

Result: 实验证明，初始化的完美雅可比正交性足以稳定训练，性能与残差网络相当。

Conclusion: 该框架不仅涵盖标准架构，还能设计新网络，无需传统跳跃连接即可实现高效训练。

Abstract: Very deep neural networks achieve state-of-the-art performance by extracting
rich, hierarchical features. Yet, training them via backpropagation is often
hindered by vanishing or exploding gradients. Existing remedies, such as
orthogonal or variance-preserving initialisation and residual architectures,
allow for a more stable gradient propagation and the training of deeper models.
In this work, we introduce a unified mathematical framework that describes a
broad class of nonlinear feedforward and residual networks, whose
input-to-output Jacobian matrices are exactly orthogonal almost everywhere.
Such a constraint forces the resulting networks to achieve perfect dynamical
isometry and train efficiently despite being very deep. Our formulation not
only recovers standard architectures as particular cases but also yields new
designs that match the trainability of residual networks without relying on
conventional skip connections. We provide experimental evidence that perfect
Jacobian orthogonality at initialisation is sufficient to stabilise training
and achieve competitive performance. We compare this strategy to networks
regularised to maintain the Jacobian orthogonality and obtain comparable
results. We further extend our analysis to a class of networks
well-approximated by those with orthogonal Jacobians and introduce networks
with Jacobians representing partial isometries. These generalized models are
then showed to maintain the favourable trainability properties.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有优化器在噪声或高粒度分类任务中表现不佳，ZetA旨在通过动态缩放和混合更新机制改进这一问题。

Method: ZetA结合了自适应阻尼、余弦相似性动量增强、熵正则化损失和SAM风格扰动。

Result: 在多个数据集上测试，ZetA的测试准确率优于Adam，尤其在噪声或高粒度任务中表现突出。

Conclusion: ZetA是一种计算高效且鲁棒的优化器，适合复杂分类任务。

Abstract: This work introduces ZetA, a novel deep learning optimizer that extends Adam
by incorporating dynamic scaling based on the Riemann zeta function. To the
best of our knowledge, ZetA is the first optimizer to apply zeta-based gradient
scaling within deep learning optimization. The method improves generalization
and robustness through a hybrid update mechanism that integrates adaptive
damping, cosine similarity-based momentum boosting, entropy-regularized loss,
and Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM)-style perturbations. Empirical
evaluations on SVHN, CIFAR10, CIFAR100, STL10, and noisy CIFAR10 consistently
show test accuracy improvements over Adam. All experiments employ a lightweight
fully connected network trained for five epochs under mixed-precision settings.
The results demonstrate that ZetA is a computationally efficient and robust
alternative to Adam, particularly effective in noisy or high-granularity
classification tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 个性化ECG生成可以推动精准医疗，但面临个体特征提取和条件注入的挑战。

Method: ECGTwin采用两阶段方法：第一阶段通过对比学习提取个体特征，第二阶段通过AdaX条件注入器结合扩散模型生成ECG。

Result: 实验表明，ECGTwin能生成高保真、多样化的ECG信号，并保留个体特征，同时提升下游自动诊断性能。

Conclusion: ECGTwin展示了精准个性化医疗的潜力，为ECG生成和诊断提供了新思路。

Abstract: Personalized electrocardiogram (ECG) generation is to simulate a patient's
ECG digital twins tailored to specific conditions. It has the potential to
transform traditional healthcare into a more accurate individualized paradigm,
while preserving the key benefits of conventional population-level ECG
synthesis. However, this promising task presents two fundamental challenges:
extracting individual features without ground truth and injecting various types
of conditions without confusing generative model. In this paper, we present
ECGTwin, a two-stage framework designed to address these challenges. In the
first stage, an Individual Base Extractor trained via contrastive learning
robustly captures personal features from a reference ECG. In the second stage,
the extracted individual features, along with a target cardiac condition, are
integrated into the diffusion-based generation process through our novel AdaX
Condition Injector, which injects these signals via two dedicated and
specialized pathways. Both qualitative and quantitative experiments have
demonstrated that our model can not only generate ECG signals of high fidelity
and diversity by offering a fine-grained generation controllability, but also
preserving individual-specific features. Furthermore, ECGTwin shows the
potential to enhance ECG auto-diagnosis in downstream application, confirming
the possibility of precise personalized healthcare solutions.

Method: 利用历史比赛数据，结合GLM、Elo评分等特征，训练LSTM和Transformer模型，并比较BCE和Brier损失函数的效果。

Result: Transformer模型在分类性能上更优（AUC 0.8473），而LSTM模型在概率校准上表现更好（Brier分数0.1589）。

Conclusion: 模型架构和损失函数的选择应根据预测任务的具体需求，研究为体育分析提供了实用框架。

Abstract: In this research, I explore advanced deep learning methodologies to forecast
the outcomes of the 2025 NCAA Division 1 Men's and Women's Basketball
tournaments. Leveraging historical NCAA game data, I implement two
sophisticated sequence-based models: Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and
Transformer architectures. The predictive power of these models is augmented
through comprehensive feature engineering, including team quality metrics
derived from Generalized Linear Models (GLM), Elo ratings, seed differences,
and aggregated box-score statistics. To evaluate the robustness and reliability
of predictions, I train each model variant using both Binary Cross-Entropy
(BCE) and Brier loss functions, providing insights into classification
performance and probability calibration. My comparative analysis reveals that
while the Transformer architecture optimized with BCE yields superior
discriminative power (highest AUC of 0.8473), the LSTM model trained with Brier
loss demonstrates superior probabilistic calibration (lowest Brier score of
0.1589). These findings underscore the importance of selecting appropriate
model architectures and loss functions based on the specific requirements of
forecasting tasks. The detailed analytical pipeline presented here serves as a
reproducible framework for future predictive modeling tasks in sports analytics
and beyond.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于混合密度网络（MDN）的增强概率建模框架，用于准确捕捉FeFET的随机性，解决了现有模型的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: FeFET的随机性对建模准确性提出挑战，现有模型难以全面捕捉其变异性或缺乏数学平滑性。

Method: 采用MDN框架，结合C-infinity连续激活函数和设备特定嵌入层，生成合成设备实例进行变异性模拟。

Result: 模型R2为0.92，能高精度捕捉FeFET电流行为的变异性。

Conclusion: 该框架为FeFET的随机行为建模提供了可扩展的数据驱动解决方案，为未来紧凑模型开发和电路模拟集成奠定基础。

Abstract: FeFETs hold strong potential for advancing memory and logic technologies, but
their inherent randomness arising from both operational cycling and fabrication
variability poses significant challenges for accurate and reliable modeling.
Capturing this variability is critical, as it enables designers to predict
behavior, optimize performance, and ensure reliability and robustness against
variations in manufacturing and operating conditions. Existing deterministic
and machine learning-based compact models often fail to capture the full extent
of this variability or lack the mathematical smoothness required for stable
circuit-level integration. In this work, we present an enhanced probabilistic
modeling framework for FeFETs that addresses these limitations. Building upon a
Mixture Density Network (MDN) foundation, our approach integrates C-infinity
continuous activation functions for smooth, stable learning and a
device-specific embedding layer to capture intrinsic physical variability
across devices. Sampling from the learned embedding distribution enables the
generation of synthetic device instances for variability-aware simulation. With
an R2 of 0.92, the model demonstrates high accuracy in capturing the
variability of FeFET current behavior. Altogether, this framework provides a
scalable, data-driven solution for modeling the full stochastic behavior of
FeFETs and offers a strong foundation for future compact model development and
circuit simulation integration.

Abstract: Large-scale tuberculosis (TB) screening is limited by the high cost and
operational complexity of traditional diagnostics, creating a need for
artificial-intelligence solutions. We propose DeepGB-TB, a non-invasive system
that instantly assigns TB risk scores using only cough audio and basic
demographic data. The model couples a lightweight one-dimensional convolutional
neural network for audio processing with a gradient-boosted decision tree for
tabular features. Its principal innovation is a Cross-Modal Bidirectional
Cross-Attention module (CM-BCA) that iteratively exchanges salient cues between
modalities, emulating the way clinicians integrate symptoms and risk factors.
To meet the clinical priority of minimizing missed cases, we design a
Tuberculosis Risk-Balanced Loss (TRBL) that places stronger penalties on
false-negative predictions, thereby reducing high-risk misclassifications.
DeepGB-TB is evaluated on a diverse dataset of 1,105 patients collected across
seven countries, achieving an AUROC of 0.903 and an F1-score of 0.851,
representing a new state of the art. Its computational efficiency enables
real-time, offline inference directly on common mobile devices, making it ideal
for low-resource settings. Importantly, the system produces clinically
validated explanations that promote trust and adoption by frontline health
workers. By coupling AI innovation with public-health requirements for speed,
affordability, and reliability, DeepGB-TB offers a tool for advancing global TB

Abstract: Pavement deterioration modeling is important in providing information
regarding the future state of the road network and in determining the needs of
preventive maintenance or rehabilitation treatments. This research incorporated
spatial dependence of road network into pavement deterioration modeling through
a graph neural network (GNN). The key motivation of using a GNN for pavement
performance modeling is the ability to easily and directly exploit the rich
structural information in the network. This paper explored if considering
spatial structure of the road network will improve the prediction performance
of the deterioration models. The data used in this research comprises a large
pavement condition data set with more than a half million observations taken
from the Pavement Management Information System (PMIS) maintained by the Texas
Department of Transportation. The promising comparison results indicates that
pavement deterioration prediction models perform better when spatial

We implement and evaluate all algorithms on two standardized datasets: an
unlabeled set from a 241Am-9Be source and a time-of-flight labeled set from a
238Pu-9Be source, using metrics including Figure of Merit (FOM), F1-score,

models, particularly Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs) and hybrid approaches
combining statistical features with neural regression, often outperform
traditional methods. We discuss architectural suitabilities, the limitations of
FOM, alternative evaluation metrics, and performance across energy thresholds.
Accompanying this work, we release an open-source toolbox in Python and MATLAB,
along with the datasets, to promote reproducibility and advance PSD research.

Motivation: 现有KV缓存淘汰方法无法适应动态注意力模式，且对边缘信息处理不足，影响模型性能。

Method: 设计两种补偿机制，利用不同规模LLM间注意力矩阵的高相似性，提出SmallKV方法辅助大模型感知全局信息并近似边缘token的注意力分数。

Result: 实验证明SmallKV在多个基准测试中有效，吞吐量比基线方法高1.75-2.56倍。

Conclusion: SmallKV在资源受限环境下实现了高效且高性能的LLM推理。

Abstract: KV cache eviction has emerged as an effective solution to alleviate resource
constraints faced by LLMs in long-context scenarios. However, existing
token-level eviction methods often overlook two critical aspects: (1) their
irreversible eviction strategy fails to adapt to dynamic attention patterns
during decoding (the saliency shift problem), and (2) they treat both
marginally important tokens and truly unimportant tokens equally, despite the
collective significance of marginal tokens to model performance (the marginal
information over-compression problem). To address these issues, we design two
compensation mechanisms based on the high similarity of attention matrices
between LLMs of different scales. We propose SmallKV, a small model assisted
compensation method for KV cache compression. SmallKV can maintain attention
matching between different-scale LLMs to: 1) assist the larger model in
perceiving globally important information of attention; and 2) use the smaller
model's attention scores to approximate those of marginal tokens in the larger
model. Extensive experiments on benchmarks including GSM8K, BBH, MT-Bench, and
LongBench demonstrate the effectiveness of SmallKV. Moreover, efficiency
evaluations show that SmallKV achieves 1.75 - 2.56 times higher throughput than
baseline methods, highlighting its potential for efficient and performant LLM
inference in resource constrained environments.

Result: 在基准数据集上的评估显示，防御方法效果显著，性能接近原始RAG系统。

Conclusion: FilterRAG和ML-FilterRAG能有效防御PoisonedRAG攻击，保障RAG系统的安全性。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a powerful approach to
boost the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) by incorporating
external, up-to-date knowledge sources. However, this introduces a potential
vulnerability to knowledge poisoning attacks, where attackers can compromise
the knowledge source to mislead the generation model. One such attack is the
PoisonedRAG in which the injected adversarial texts steer the model to generate
an attacker-chosen response to a target question. In this work, we propose
novel defense methods, FilterRAG and ML-FilterRAG, to mitigate the PoisonedRAG
attack. First, we propose a new property to uncover distinct properties to
differentiate between adversarial and clean texts in the knowledge data source.
Next, we employ this property to filter out adversarial texts from clean ones
in the design of our proposed approaches. Evaluation of these methods using
benchmark datasets demonstrate their effectiveness, with performances close to
those of the original RAG systems.

Result: 在13个真实世界基准测试中，DMSC表现出最先进的性能和计算效率。

Conclusion: DMSC通过动态多尺度协调和自适应融合机制，显著提升了时间序列预测的性能。

Abstract: Time Series Forecasting (TSF) faces persistent challenges in modeling
intricate temporal dependencies across different scales. Despite recent
advances leveraging different decomposition operations and novel architectures
based on CNN, MLP or Transformer, existing methods still struggle with static
decomposition strategies, fragmented dependency modeling, and inflexible fusion
mechanisms, limiting their ability to model intricate temporal dependencies. To
explicitly solve the mentioned three problems respectively, we propose a novel
Dynamic Multi-Scale Coordination Framework (DMSC) with Multi-Scale Patch
Decomposition block (EMPD), Triad Interaction Block (TIB) and Adaptive Scale
Routing MoE block (ASR-MoE). Specifically, EMPD is designed as a built-in
component to dynamically segment sequences into hierarchical patches with
exponentially scaled granularities, eliminating predefined scale constraints
through input-adaptive patch adjustment. TIB then jointly models intra-patch,
inter-patch, and cross-variable dependencies within each layer's decomposed
representations. EMPD and TIB are jointly integrated into layers forming a
multi-layer progressive cascade architecture, where coarse-grained
representations from earlier layers adaptively guide fine-grained feature
extraction in subsequent layers via gated pathways. And ASR-MoE dynamically
fuses multi-scale predictions by leveraging specialized global and local
experts with temporal-aware weighting. Comprehensive experiments on thirteen
real-world benchmarks demonstrate that DMSC consistently maintains
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance and superior computational efficiency for
TSF tasks. Code is available at https://github.com/1327679995/DMSC.

Method: 引入多个结构化提示，每个提示包含自适应令牌，联合处理并通过多样性正则化和否定感知损失优化。

Result: 在图像-文本和视频-文本检索任务中表现优于基准模型。

Conclusion: 多提示嵌入方法能有效提升语义对齐和对比学习性能。

Abstract: We propose Context-Adaptive Multi-Prompt Embedding, a novel approach to
enrich semantic representations in vision-language contrastive learning. Unlike
standard CLIP-style models that rely on a single text embedding, our method
introduces multiple structured prompts, each containing a distinct adaptive
token that captures diverse semantic aspects of the input text. We process all
prompts jointly in a single forward pass. The resulting prompt embeddings are
combined into a unified text representation, enabling semantically richer
alignment with visual features. To further promote semantic diversity and
representation quality, we incorporate a diversity regularization loss and a
negation-aware loss, encouraging specialization across prompts and improving
contrastive discrimination. Our method achieves consistent improvements on both
image-text and video-text retrieval benchmarks.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统分布鲁棒评估与学习方法过于保守，导致评估结果和策略不准确。

Method: 使用结构方程模型（SEM）构建不确定性集，结合条件独立性检测优化建模。

Result: SEM方法在评估准确性和策略方差方面优于传统方法，尤其在大偏移情况下表现更优。

Conclusion: SEM方法在模型充分指定的情况下能学习到最优策略，提供更准确的评估和低方差策略。

Abstract: Distributionally robust evaluation estimates the worst-case expected return
over an uncertainty set of possible covariate and reward distributions, and
distributionally robust learning finds a policy that maximizes that worst-case
return across that uncertainty set. Unfortunately, current methods for
distributionally robust evaluation and learning create overly conservative
evaluations and policies. In this work, we propose a practical bandit
evaluation and learning algorithm that tailors the uncertainty set to specific
problems using mathematical programs constrained by structural equation models.
Further, we show how conditional independence testing can be used to detect
shifted variables for modeling. We find that the structural equation model
(SEM) approach gives more accurate evaluations and learns lower-variance
policies than traditional approaches, particularly for large shifts. Further,
the SEM approach learns an optimal policy, assuming the model is sufficiently
well-specified.

Conclusion: GRPO和TIC GRPO为无评论家强化学习提供了高效方法，TIC GRPO进一步优化了估计的无偏性，并首次提供了理论收敛分析。

Abstract: Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), recently proposed by DeepSeek, is
a critic-free reinforcement learning algorithm for fine tuning large language
models. It replaces the value function in Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)
with group normalized rewards, while retaining PPO style token level importance
sampling based on an old policy. We show that GRPO update rule in fact
estimates the policy gradient at the old policy rather than the current one.
However, since the old policy is refreshed every few steps, the discrepancy
between the two remains small limiting the impact of this bias in practice. We
validate this through an ablation study in which importance sampling is
entirely removed, and updates are instead performed using the gradient
estimated at a fixed old policy across multiple optimization steps. Remarkably,
this simplification results in performance comparable to standard GRPO.
  Motivated by these findings, we propose a new algorithm: Trajectory level
Importance Corrected GRPO (TIC GRPO). TIC GRPO replaces token level importance
ratios with a single trajectory level probability ratio, yielding an unbiased
estimate of the current policy gradient while preserving the critic free
structure. Furthermore, we present the first theoretical convergence analysis
for GRPO style methods, covering both the original GRPO and our proposed
variant.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有抗体设计方法采用统一生成策略，无法适应不同抗原的独特需求，因此需要一种更灵活、生物启发的自适应方法。

Method: 利用多个专家（如范德华力、分子识别等）的参数动态调整，模拟自然抗体优化过程，实现个性化优化策略。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能自适应发现不同抗原类的最优策略，显著提升热点覆盖和界面质量，并适用于多样化设计挑战。

Conclusion: 该框架为抗体设计提供了一种自适应、多目标优化的新范式，适用于广泛的抗原目标。

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have shown remarkable potential for
antibody design, yet existing approaches apply uniform generation strategies
that cannot adapt to each antigen's unique requirements. Inspired by B cell
affinity maturation, where antibodies evolve through multi-objective
optimization balancing affinity, stability, and self-avoidance, we propose the
first biologically-motivated framework that leverages physics-based domain
knowledge within an online meta-learning system. Our method employs multiple
specialized experts (van der Waals, molecular recognition, energy balance, and
interface geometry) whose parameters evolve during generation based on
iterative feedback, mimicking natural antibody refinement cycles. Instead of
fixed protocols, this adaptive guidance discovers personalized optimization
strategies for each target. Our experiments demonstrate that this approach: (1)
discovers optimal SE(3)-equivariant guidance strategies for different antigen
classes without pre-training, preserving molecular symmetries throughout
optimization; (2) significantly enhances hotspot coverage and interface quality
through target-specific adaptation, achieving balanced multi-objective
optimization characteristic of therapeutic antibodies; (3) establishes a
paradigm for iterative refinement where each antibody-antigen system learns its
unique optimization profile through online evaluation; (4) generalizes
effectively across diverse design challenges, from small epitopes to large
protein interfaces, enabling precision-focused campaigns for individual
targets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 软件系统复杂性增加导致网络安全漏洞激增，需要高效且可扩展的漏洞评估解决方案，但大型预训练模型的计算和存储需求阻碍其实际部署。

Method: 采用两阶段方法：1) 使用粒子群优化优化紧凑学生模型架构；2) 通过知识蒸馏将关键漏洞评估知识从大型教师模型转移到学生模型。

Result: 在增强的MegaVul数据集上，模型大小减少99.4%，保留89.3%准确率，优于基线1.7%准确率且参数减少60%，训练时间减少72.1%，架构搜索时间减少34.88%。

Conclusion: 该框架在资源受限场景下实现了高效且高性能的漏洞评估，为实际部署提供了可行方案。

Abstract: The increasing complexity of software systems has led to a surge in
cybersecurity vulnerabilities, necessitating efficient and scalable solutions
for vulnerability assessment. However, the deployment of large pre-trained
models in real-world scenarios is hindered by their substantial computational
and storage demands. To address this challenge, we propose a novel
resource-efficient framework that integrates knowledge distillation and
particle swarm optimization to enable automated vulnerability assessment. Our
framework employs a two-stage approach: First, particle swarm optimization is
utilized to optimize the architecture of a compact student model, balancing
computational efficiency and model capacity. Second, knowledge distillation is
applied to transfer critical vulnerability assessment knowledge from a large
teacher model to the optimized student model. This process significantly
reduces the model size while maintaining high performance. Experimental results
on an enhanced MegaVul dataset, comprising 12,071 CVSS (Common Vulnerability
Scoring System) v3 annotated vulnerabilities, demonstrate the effectiveness of
our approach. Our approach achieves a 99.4% reduction in model size while
retaining 89.3% of the original model's accuracy. Furthermore, it outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines by 1.7% in accuracy with 60% fewer parameters. The
framework also reduces training time by 72.1% and architecture search time by
34.88% compared to traditional genetic algorithms.

TL;DR: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) 作为参数高效的神经网络替代方案，在无监督故障检测中表现出色，尤其是 WavKAN-AE 和 EfficientKAN-AE 在数据效率方面表现突出。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索 KANs 在无监督故障检测中的潜力，尤其是在化学过程中，以解决传统方法在数据效率和性能上的不足。

Method: 比较四种 KAN-AE 变体（EfficientKAN、FastKAN、FourierKAN、WavKAN）与正交自编码器（OAE）在 Tennessee Eastman Process 上的性能，使用故障检测率（FDR）作为指标。

Result: WavKAN-AE 在 4,000 样本下达到最高 FDR（≥92%），EfficientKAN-AE 在低数据量（500 样本）下表现稳健（≥90%）。FastKAN-AE 在大规模数据下竞争，FourierKAN-AE 表现较差。OAE 需要更多数据才能匹配 KAN-AE。

Conclusion: KAN-AEs 结合了数据效率和强故障检测性能，其结构化基函数可能提升模型透明度，适合数据受限的工业场景。

Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) have recently emerged as a flexible and
parameter-efficient alternative to conventional neural networks. Unlike
standard architectures that use fixed node-based activations, KANs place
learnable functions on edges, parameterized by different function families.
While they have shown promise in supervised settings, their utility in
unsupervised fault detection remains largely unexplored. This study presents a
comparative evaluation of KAN-based autoencoders (KAN-AEs) for unsupervised
fault detection in chemical processes. We investigate four KAN-AE variants,
each based on a different KAN implementation (EfficientKAN, FastKAN,
FourierKAN, and WavKAN), and benchmark them against an Orthogonal Autoencoder
(OAE) on the Tennessee Eastman Process. Models are trained on normal operating
data across 13 training set sizes and evaluated on 21 fault types, using Fault
Detection Rate (FDR) as the performance metric. WavKAN-AE achieves the highest
overall FDR ($\geq$92\%) using just 4,000 training samples and remains the top
performer, even as other variants are trained on larger datasets.
EfficientKAN-AE reaches $\geq$90\% FDR with only 500 samples, demonstrating
robustness in low-data settings. FastKAN-AE becomes competitive at larger
scales ($\geq$50,000 samples), while FourierKAN-AE consistently underperforms.
The OAE baseline improves gradually but requires substantially more data to
match top KAN-AE performance. These results highlight the ability of KAN-AEs to
combine data efficiency with strong fault detection performance. Their use of
structured basis functions suggests potential for improved model transparency,
making them promising candidates for deployment in data-constrained industrial
settings.

Motivation: 传统最小二乘回归在高斯噪声下表现良好，但在非对称结构化噪声下失效，需要更鲁棒的方法。

Method: 结合Transformer编码器处理数值序列，压缩神经网络预测符号参数，固定符号方程重建序列。

Result: 在合成可穿戴数据上，中位数回归MSE为6e-6至3.5e-5，比最小二乘和鲁棒回归方法提升10-300倍。

Conclusion: 混合神经符号架构能有效处理非对称结构化噪声，显著优于传统回归方法。

Abstract: Robust regression techniques rely on least-squares optimization, which works
well for Gaussian noise but fails in the presence of asymmetric structured
noise. We propose a hybrid neural-symbolic architecture where a transformer
encoder processes numerical sequences, a compression NN predicts symbolic
parameters, and a fixed symbolic equation reconstructs the original sequence.
Using synthetic data, the training objective is to recover the original
sequence after adding asymmetric structured noise, effectively learning a
symbolic fit guided by neural parameter estimation. Our model achieves a median
regression MSE of 6e-6 to 3.5e-5 on synthetic wearable data, which is a 10-300
times improvement when compared with ordinary least squares fit and robust
regression techniques such as Huber loss or SoftL1.

Result: CauKer生成的数据集在数据集规模和模型容量上表现出清晰的扩展规律，优于真实数据集的不规则扩展行为。

Conclusion: CauKer为TSFMs的高效预训练提供了可行的合成数据解决方案。

Abstract: Time series foundation models (TSFMs) have recently gained significant
attention due to their strong zero-shot capabilities and widespread real-world
applications. Such models typically require a computationally costly
pretraining on large-scale, carefully curated collections of real-world
sequences. To allow for a sample-efficient pretraining of TSFMs, we propose
CauKer, a novel algorithm designed to generate diverse, causally coherent
synthetic time series with realistic trends, seasonality, and nonlinear
interactions. CauKer combines Gaussian Process (GP) kernel composition with
Structural Causal Models (SCM) to produce data for sample-efficient pretraining
of state-of-the-art classification TSFMs having different architectures and
following different pretraining approaches. Additionally, our experiments
reveal that CauKer-generated datasets exhibit clear scaling laws for both
dataset size (10K to 10M samples) and model capacity (1M to 783M parameters),
unlike real-world datasets, which display irregular scaling behavior.

Motivation: 现有建模方法难以捕捉电力电子系统中持续演化的混合动态，导致在资源受限的边缘设备上仿真到现实的泛化能力下降。

Method: PENODE通过嵌入混合操作机制作为事件自动机来显式管理离散切换，并将已知的ODE组件直接注入神经参数化中，以统一设计可微分的端到端可训练架构。

Conclusion: PENODE成功实现了物理可解释性、高效边缘部署和实时控制增强，为电力电子系统的边缘数字孪生提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Edge Digital Twins (EDTs) are crucial for monitoring and control of Power
Electronics Systems (PES). However, existing modeling approaches struggle to
consistently capture continuously evolving hybrid dynamics that are inherent in
PES, degrading Sim-to-Real generalization on resource-constrained edge devices.
To address these challenges, this paper proposes a Physics-Embedded Neural ODEs
(PENODE) that (i) embeds the hybrid operating mechanism as an event automaton
to explicitly govern discrete switching and (ii) injects known governing ODE
components directly into the neural parameterization of unmodeled dynamics.
This unified design yields a differentiable end-to-end trainable architecture
that preserves physical interpretability while reducing redundancy, and it
supports a cloud-to-edge toolchain for efficient FPGA deployment. Experimental
results demonstrate that PENODE achieves significantly higher accuracy in
benchmarks in white-box, gray-box, and black-box scenarios, with a 75%
reduction in neuron count, validating that the proposed PENODE maintains
physical interpretability, efficient edge deployment, and real-time control
enhancement.

Conclusion: 论文总结了Clus-UCB的优势，并指出了未来研究的可能方向。

Abstract: We study a stochastic multi-armed bandit setting where arms are partitioned
into known clusters, such that the mean rewards of arms within a cluster differ
by at most a known threshold. While the clustering structure is known a priori,
the arm means are unknown. This framework models scenarios where outcomes
depend on multiple factors -- some with significant and others with minor
influence -- such as online advertising, clinical trials, and wireless
communication. We derive asymptotic lower bounds on the regret that improve
upon the classical bound of Lai & Robbins (1985). We then propose Clus-UCB, an
efficient algorithm that closely matches this lower bound asymptotically.
Clus-UCB is designed to exploit the clustering structure and introduces a new
index to evaluate an arm, which depends on other arms within the cluster. In
this way, arms share information among each other. We present simulation
results of our algorithm and compare its performance against KL-UCB and other
well-known algorithms for bandits with dependent arms. Finally, we address some
limitations of this work and conclude by mentioning possible future research.

Conclusion: 该方法提供了目前最通用和准确的低推力轨迹近似器，适用于多样化任务场景，且无需重新训练。

Abstract: In trajectory design, fuel consumption and trajectory reachability are two
key performance indicators for low-thrust missions. This paper proposes
general-purpose pretrained neural networks to predict these metrics. The
contributions of this paper are as follows: Firstly, based on the confirmation
of the Scaling Law applicable to low-thrust trajectory approximation, the
largest dataset is constructed using the proposed homotopy ray method, which
aligns with mission-design-oriented data requirements. Secondly, the data are
transformed into a self-similar space, enabling the neural network to adapt to
arbitrary semi-major axes, inclinations, and central bodies. This extends the
applicability beyond existing studies and can generalize across diverse mission
scenarios without retraining. Thirdly, to the best of our knowledge, this work
presents the current most general and accurate low-thrust trajectory
approximator, with implementations available in C++, Python, and MATLAB. The
resulting neural network achieves a relative error of 0.78% in predicting
velocity increments and 0.63% in minimum transfer time estimation. The models
have also been validated on a third-party dataset, multi-flyby mission design
problem, and mission analysis scenario, demonstrating their generalization
capability, predictive accuracy, and computational efficiency.

Conclusion: GrandJury为AI从业者提供了一种在没有绝对真实值的情况下评估机器学习输出的新范式。

Abstract: Generative Machine Learning models have become central to modern systems,
powering applications in creative writing, summarization, multi-hop reasoning,
and context-aware dialogue. These models underpin large-scale AI assistants,
workflow automation, and autonomous decision-making. In such domains,
acceptable response is rarely absolute or static, but plural and highly
context-dependent. Yet standard evaluation regimes still rely on static,
benchmark-style tests, incentivizing optimization toward leaderboard scores
rather than alignment with dynamic user needs or evolving realities. GrandJury
introduces a formal evaluation protocol combining time-decayed aggregation,
complete traceability, with the support of dynamic, transparent task rubric
attribution, and multi-rater human judgment. Together, these elements enable
pluralistic, accountable evaluation that captures evolving consensus and
surfaces disagreement. We provide an open-source implementation (grandjury PyPI
package) and a public collection of Large Language Model (LLM) inference
outputs to illustrate the need and method. GrandJury provides a new paradigm
for AI practitioners when evaluating machine learning outputs without absolute

Conclusion: PLoRA显著提升了LoRA微调的效率和性能，适用于多种大型语言模型。

Abstract: Low-rank Adaptation (LoRA) has gained popularity as a fine-tuning approach
for Large Language Models (LLMs) due to its low resource requirements and good
performance. While a plethora of work has investigated improving LoRA serving
efficiency by serving multiple LoRAs concurrently, existing methods assume that
a wide range of LoRA adapters are available for serving. In our work, we
conduct extensive empirical studies to identify that current training paradigms
do not utilize hardware resources efficiently and require high overhead to
obtain a performant LoRA. Leveraging these insights, we propose PLoRA, which
automatically orchestrates concurrent LoRA fine-tuning jobs under given
hardware and model constraints and develops performant kernels to improve
training efficiency. Our experimental studies show that PLoRA reduces the
makespan of LoRA fine-tuning over a given hyperparameter search space by up to
7.52x and improves training throughput by up to 12.8x across a range of
state-of-the-art LLMs.

Conclusion: 该研究为开发真正鲁棒的多智能体系统提供了新路径。

Abstract: Well-trained multi-agent systems can fail when deployed in real-world
environments due to model mismatches between the training and deployment
environments, caused by environment uncertainties including noise or
adversarial attacks. Distributionally Robust Markov Games (DRMGs) enhance
system resilience by optimizing for worst-case performance over a defined set
of environmental uncertainties. However, current methods are limited by their
dependence on simulators or large offline datasets, which are often
unavailable. This paper pioneers the study of online learning in DRMGs, where
agents learn directly from environmental interactions without prior data. We
introduce the {\it Robust Optimistic Nash Value Iteration (RONAVI)} algorithm
and provide the first provable guarantees for this setting. Our theoretical
analysis demonstrates that the algorithm achieves low regret and efficiently
finds the optimal robust policy for uncertainty sets measured by Total
Variation divergence and Kullback-Leibler divergence. These results establish a
new, practical path toward developing truly robust multi-agent systems.

Conclusion: 该方法通过整合测量信息，显著提升了扩散模型在逆问题求解中的性能。

Abstract: Diffusion models have been firmly established as principled zero-shot solvers
for linear and nonlinear inverse problems, owing to their powerful image prior
and iterative sampling algorithm. These approaches often rely on Tweedie's
formula, which relates the diffusion variate $\mathbf{x}_t$ to the posterior
mean $\mathbb{E} [\mathbf{x}_0 | \mathbf{x}_t]$, in order to guide the
diffusion trajectory with an estimate of the final denoised sample
$\mathbf{x}_0$. However, this does not consider information from the
measurement $\mathbf{y}$, which must then be integrated downstream. In this
work, we propose to estimate the conditional posterior mean $\mathbb{E}
[\mathbf{x}_0 | \mathbf{x}_t, \mathbf{y}]$, which can be formulated as the
solution to a lightweight, single-parameter maximum likelihood estimation
problem. The resulting prediction can be integrated into any standard sampler,
resulting in a fast and memory-efficient inverse solver. Our optimizer is
amenable to a noise-aware likelihood-based stopping criteria that is robust to
measurement noise in $\mathbf{y}$. We demonstrate comparable or improved
performance against a wide selection of contemporary inverse solvers across
multiple datasets and tasks.

connects density-based clustering with graph connectivity, enabling the use of

scalability, we introduce a density-aware neighborhood propagation algorithm
and leverage advanced random projection methods to construct approximate

Abstract: Decentralized Federated Learning (DFL) struggles with the slow adaptation of
late-joining delayed clients and high communication costs in asynchronous
environments. These limitations significantly hinder overall performance. To
address this, we propose DFedCAD, a novel framework for rapid adaptation via
Centroid-Aligned Distillation. DFedCAD first employs Weighted Cluster Pruning
(WCP) to compress models into representative centroids, drastically reducing
communication overhead. It then enables delayed clients to intelligently weigh
and align with peer knowledge using a novel structural distance metric and a

### [177] [Where and How to Enhance: Discovering Bit-Width Contribution for Mixed Precision Quantization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03002)
*Haidong Kang,Lianbo Ma,Guo Yu,Shangce Gao*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于Shapley值的混合精度量化方法（SMPQ），通过直接测量比特宽度对任务性能的贡献，解决了传统梯度方法（DMPQ）中比特宽度选择不准确的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有混合精度量化方法（MPQ）通过梯度下降优化比特宽度分配，但量化参数的大小并不能准确反映其对任务性能的实际贡献，因此需要更准确的比特宽度选择方法。

Method: 提出SMPQ方法，利用Shapley值直接测量比特宽度对MPQ任务的贡献，并通过蒙特卡洛采样降低计算成本。

Result: 在主流基准测试中，SMPQ表现优于基于梯度的方法，达到最先进的性能。

Conclusion: SMPQ通过更准确的比特宽度贡献评估，显著提升了混合精度量化的性能。

Abstract: Mixed precision quantization (MPQ) is an effective quantization approach to
achieve accuracy-complexity trade-off of neural network, through assigning
different bit-widths to network activations and weights in each layer. The
typical way of existing MPQ methods is to optimize quantization policies (i.e.,
bit-width allocation) in a gradient descent manner, termed as Differentiable
(DMPQ). At the end of the search, the bit-width associated to the quantization
parameters which has the largest value will be selected to form the final mixed
precision quantization policy, with the implicit assumption that the values of
quantization parameters reflect the operation contribution to the accuracy
improvement. While much has been discussed about the MPQ improvement, the
bit-width selection process has received little attention. We study this
problem and argue that the magnitude of quantization parameters does not
necessarily reflect the actual contribution of the bit-width to the task
performance. Then, we propose a Shapley-based MPQ (SMPQ) method, which measures
the bit-width operation direct contribution on the MPQ task. To reduce
computation cost, a Monte Carlo sampling-based approximation strategy is
proposed for Shapley computation. Extensive experiments on mainstream
benchmarks demonstrate that our SMPQ consistently achieves state-of-the-art
performance than gradient-based competitors.

Conclusion: 通过扩散建模和特征对齐机制，单阶段方法在城市场景分析中表现出优越性，为未来研究提供了新方向。

Abstract: Urban profiling aims to predict urban profiles in unknown regions and plays a
critical role in economic and social censuses. Existing approaches typically
follow a two-stage paradigm: first, learning representations of urban areas;
second, performing downstream prediction via linear probing, which originates
from the BERT era. Inspired by the development of GPT style models, recent
studies have shown that novel self-supervised pretraining schemes can endow
models with direct applicability to downstream tasks, thereby eliminating the
need for task-specific fine-tuning. This is largely because GPT unifies the
form of pretraining and inference through next-token prediction. However, urban
data exhibit structural characteristics that differ fundamentally from
language, making it challenging to design a one-stage model that unifies both
pretraining and inference. In this work, we propose Urban In-Context Learning,
a framework that unifies pretraining and inference via a masked autoencoding
process over urban regions. To capture the distribution of urban profiles, we
introduce the Urban Masked Diffusion Transformer, which enables each region' s
prediction to be represented as a distribution rather than a deterministic
value. Furthermore, to stabilize diffusion training, we propose the Urban
Representation Alignment Mechanism, which regularizes the model's intermediate
features by aligning them with those from classical urban profiling methods.
Extensive experiments on three indicators across two cities demonstrate that
our one-stage method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art two-stage
approaches. Ablation studies and case studies further validate the
effectiveness of each proposed module, particularly the use of diffusion
modeling.

Abstract: Alzheimers Disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that
poses significant challenges in its early diagnosis, often leading to delayed
treatment and poorer outcomes for patients. Traditional diagnostic methods,
typically reliant on single data modalities, fall short of capturing the
multifaceted nature of the disease. In this paper, we propose a novel
multimodal framework for the early detection of AD that integrates data from
three primary sources: MRI imaging, cognitive assessments, and biomarkers. This
framework employs Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for analyzing MRI images
and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for processing cognitive and
biomarker data. The system enhances diagnostic accuracy and reliability by
aggregating results from these distinct modalities using advanced techniques
like weighted averaging, even in incomplete data. The multimodal approach not
only improves the robustness of the detection process but also enables the
identification of AD at its earliest stages, offering a significant advantage
over conventional methods. The integration of biomarkers and cognitive tests is
particularly crucial, as these can detect Alzheimer's long before the onset of
clinical symptoms, thereby facilitating earlier intervention and potentially
altering the course of the disease. This research demonstrates that the
proposed framework has the potential to revolutionize the early detection of
AD, paving the way for more timely and effective treatments

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实场景中RLHF常因噪声奖励导致策略不稳定和泛化能力下降，现有方法多忽视价值模型的关键作用。

Method: 提出VRPO框架，结合基于熵和困惑度的辅助损失与变分信息瓶颈，增强价值模型的噪声过滤能力。

Result: 在数学推理、科学问答和多轮对话任务中，VRPO在噪声奖励下表现优于PPO和GRPO基线。

Conclusion: 研究强调了价值模型在RLHF中的重要性，并提供了噪声环境下鲁棒策略优化的实用方法。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) often suffers from noisy or
imperfect reward supervision in real-world settings, which undermines policy
stability and generalization. Such noise may cause models to lose attention on
key words during advantage estimation. While prior work focuses on reward
denoising or filtering poor data, it often overlooks the critical role of the
value model in policy optimization. In this work, we show that a strong value
model is essential for mitigating noise by absorbing unstable signals and
enabling more reliable advantage estimation. We propose VRPO, a value-centric
framework for robust PPO training under noisy supervision. VRPO combines two
core designs: (1) an auxiliary loss guided by entropy and perplexity from a
frozen language model, and (2) a variational information bottleneck. These
mechanisms enhance the value model's ability to filter out noise and capture
key words from the context during advantage estimation, transforming it from a
passive predictor into an active regulator of noise. Experiments on math
reasoning, science QA, and multi-turn dialogue, under both rule-based and
model-based noisy rewards, show that VRPO consistently outperforms PPO and GRPO
baselines. Our findings underscore the often-overlooked importance of the value
model in RLHF and offer a principled and practical approach to robust policy
optimization in noisy real-world environments.

Method: 提出了两种算法：B-MNL-CB（批处理设置）和RS-MNL（罕见切换设置），分别适用于随机和对抗性上下文生成。

Result: B-MNL-CB在随机上下文中实现$\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$遗憾，RS-MNL在对抗性上下文中同样实现$\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$遗憾。实验表明这些算法优于现有基线。

Conclusion: 论文提出的算法在有限策略更新下表现优异，适用于多种实际场景。

Abstract: Multinomial Logistic Bandits have recently attracted much attention due to
their ability to model problems with multiple outcomes. In this setting, each
decision is associated with many possible outcomes, modeled using a multinomial
logit function. Several recent works on multinomial logistic bandits have
simultaneously achieved optimal regret and computational efficiency. However,
motivated by real-world challenges and practicality, there is a need to develop
algorithms with limited adaptivity, wherein we are allowed only $M$ policy
updates. To address these challenges, we present two algorithms, B-MNL-CB and
RS-MNL, that operate in the batched and rarely-switching paradigms,
respectively. The batched setting involves choosing the $M$ policy update
rounds at the start of the algorithm, while the rarely-switching setting can
choose these $M$ policy update rounds in an adaptive fashion. Our first
algorithm, B-MNL-CB extends the notion of distributional optimal designs to the
multinomial setting and achieves $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ regret assuming the
contexts are generated stochastically when presented with $\Omega(\log \log T)$
update rounds. Our second algorithm, RS-MNL works with adversarially generated
contexts and can achieve $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ regret with $\tilde{O}(\log T)$
policy updates. Further, we conducted experiments that demonstrate that our
algorithms (with a fixed number of policy updates) are extremely competitive
(and often better) than several state-of-the-art baselines (which update their
policy every round), showcasing the applicability of our algorithms in various
practical scenarios.

Result: 实验证明HiTeC在文本属性超图上具有高效性和可扩展性。

Conclusion: HiTeC通过两阶段设计和语义感知增强，显著提升了文本属性超图的表示学习效果。

Abstract: Contrastive learning (CL) has become a dominant paradigm for self-supervised
hypergraph learning, enabling effective training without costly labels.
However, node entities in real-world hypergraphs are often associated with rich
textual information, which is overlooked in prior works. Directly applying
existing CL-based methods to such text-attributed hypergraphs (TAHGs) leads to
three key limitations: (1) The common use of graph-agnostic text encoders
overlooks the correlations between textual content and hypergraph topology,
resulting in suboptimal representations. (2) Their reliance on random data
augmentations introduces noise and weakens the contrastive objective. (3) The
primary focus on node- and hyperedge-level contrastive signals limits the
ability to capture long-range dependencies, which is essential for expressive
representation learning. Although HyperBERT pioneers CL on TAHGs, its
co-training paradigm suffers from poor scalability. To fill the research gap,
we introduce HiTeC, a two-stage hierarchical contrastive learning framework
with semantic-aware augmentation for scalable and effective self-supervised
learning on TAHGs. In the first stage, we pre-train the text encoder with a
structure-aware contrastive objective to overcome the graph-agnostic nature of
conventional methods. In the second stage, we introduce two semantic-aware
augmentation strategies, including prompt-enhanced text augmentation and
semantic-aware hyperedge drop, to facilitate informative view generation.
Furthermore, we propose a multi-scale contrastive loss that extends existing
objectives with an $s$-walk-based subgraph-level contrast to better capture
long-range dependencies. By decoupling text encoder pretraining from hypergraph
contrastive learning, this two-stage design enhances scalability without
compromising representation quality. Extensive experiments confirm the
effectiveness of HiTeC.

Motivation: 研究SGDM在动态调度下的收敛行为，为深度学习训练提供高效稳定的理论基础和实用指导。

Method: 引入结构更简单的Lyapunov函数，扩展理论框架以涵盖三种常见动态调度策略，并进行实证验证。

Result: 动态调度的SGDM在收敛速度上显著优于固定超参数基线，其中学习率和批量大小同时增加的策略表现最佳。

Conclusion: 研究为现代深度学习提供了统一的理论基础和实用设计指南，动态调度策略能显著提升训练效率。

Abstract: We analyze the convergence behavior of stochastic gradient descent with
momentum (SGDM) under dynamic learning rate and batch size schedules by
introducing a novel Lyapunov function. This Lyapunov function has a simpler
structure compared with existing ones, facilitating the challenging convergence
analysis of SGDM and a unified analysis across various dynamic schedules.
Specifically, we extend the theoretical framework to cover three practical
scheduling strategies commonly used in deep learning: (i) constant batch size
with a decaying learning rate, (ii) increasing batch size with a decaying
learning rate, and (iii) increasing batch size with an increasing learning
rate. Our theoretical results reveal a clear hierarchy in convergence behavior:
while (i) does not guarantee convergence of the expected gradient norm, both
(ii) and (iii) do. Moreover, (iii) achieves a provably faster decay rate than
(i) and (ii), demonstrating theoretical acceleration even in the presence of
momentum. Empirical results validate our theory, showing that dynamically
scheduled SGDM significantly outperforms fixed-hyperparameter baselines in
convergence speed. We also evaluated a warm-up schedule in experiments, which
empirically outperformed all other strategies in convergence behavior. These
findings provide a unified theoretical foundation and practical guidance for
designing efficient and stable training procedures in modern deep learning.

Result: 大量实验验证了框架的有效性。

Conclusion: 该框架在更宽松的假设下显著提升了OOD检测性能。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection lies at the heart of robust artificial
intelligence (AI), aiming to identify samples from novel distributions beyond
the training set. Recent approaches have exploited feature representations as
distinguishing signatures for OOD detection. However, most existing methods
rely on restrictive assumptions on the feature space that limit the
separability between in-distribution (ID) and OOD samples. In this work, we
propose a novel OOD detection framework based on a pseudo-label-induced
subspace representation, that works under more relaxed and natural assumptions
compared to existing feature-based techniques. In addition, we introduce a
simple yet effective learning criterion that integrates a cross-entropy-based
ID classification loss with a subspace distance-based regularization loss to
enhance ID-OOD separability. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness
of our framework.

Abstract: Graph Edit Distance (GED) is defined as the minimum cost transformation of
one graph into another and is a widely adopted metric for measuring the
dissimilarity between graphs. The major problem of GED is that its computation
is NP-hard, which has in turn led to the development of various approximation
methods, including approaches based on neural networks (NN). Most of these
NN-based models simplify the problem of GED by assuming unit-cost edit
operations, a rather unrealistic constraint in real-world applications. In this
work, we present a novel Graph Neural Network framework that approximates GED
using both supervised and unsupervised training. In the unsupervised setting,
it employs a gradient-only self-organizing mechanism that enables optimization
without ground-truth distances. Moreover, a core component of our architecture
is the integration of a Generalized Additive Model, which allows the flexible
and interpretable learning of context-aware edit costs. Experimental results
show that the proposed method achieves similar results as state-of-the-art
reference methods, yet significantly improves both adaptability and
interpretability. That is, the learned cost function offers insights into
complex graph structures, making it particularly valuable in domains such as
molecular analysis and structural pattern discovery.

Result: 实验表明，RegMean++在多种场景下优于RegMean，并达到或超越现有先进方法的性能。

Conclusion: RegMean++是一种简单有效的模型合并方法，显著提升了性能和应用范围。

Abstract: Regression Mean (RegMean), an approach that formulates model merging as a
linear regression problem, aims to find the optimal weights for each linear
layer in the merge model by minimizing the discrepancy in predictions between
the merge and candidate models. RegMean provides a precise closed-form solution
for the merging problem; therefore, it offers explainability and computational
efficiency. However, RegMean merges each linear layer independently,
overlooking how the features and information in the earlier layers propagate
through the layers and influence the final prediction in the merge model. In
this paper, we introduce RegMean++, a simple yet effective alternative to
RegMean, that explicitly incorporates both intra- and cross-layer dependencies
between merge models' layers into RegMean's objective. By accounting for these
dependencies, RegMean++ better captures the behaviors of the merge model.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that RegMean++ consistently outperforms
RegMean across diverse settings, including in-domain (ID) and out-of-domain
(OOD) generalization, sequential merging, large-scale tasks, and robustness
under several types of distribution shifts. Furthermore, RegMean++ achieves
competitive or state-of-the-art performance compared to various recent advanced

Abstract: In this paper, we study the worst-case frontier risks of releasing gpt-oss.
We introduce malicious fine-tuning (MFT), where we attempt to elicit maximum
capabilities by fine-tuning gpt-oss to be as capable as possible in two
domains: biology and cybersecurity. To maximize biological risk (biorisk), we
curate tasks related to threat creation and train gpt-oss in an RL environment
with web browsing. To maximize cybersecurity risk, we train gpt-oss in an
agentic coding environment to solve capture-the-flag (CTF) challenges. We
compare these MFT models against open- and closed-weight LLMs on frontier risk
evaluations. Compared to frontier closed-weight models, MFT gpt-oss
underperforms OpenAI o3, a model that is below Preparedness High capability
level for biorisk and cybersecurity. Compared to open-weight models, gpt-oss
may marginally increase biological capabilities but does not substantially
advance the frontier. Taken together, these results contributed to our decision
to release the model, and we hope that our MFT approach can serve as useful
guidance for estimating harm from future open-weight releases.

Abstract: House price valuation remains challenging due to localized market variations.
Existing approaches often rely on black-box machine learning models, which lack
interpretability, or simplistic methods like linear regression (LR), which fail
to capture market heterogeneity. To address this, we propose a machine learning
approach that applies two-stage clustering, first grouping properties based on
minimal location-based features before incorporating additional features. Each
cluster is then modeled using either LR or a generalized additive model (GAM),
balancing predictive performance with interpretability. Constructing and
evaluating our models on 43,309 German house property listings from 2023, we
achieve a 36% improvement for the GAM and 58% for LR in mean absolute error
compared to models without clustering. Additionally, graphical analyses unveil
pattern shifts between clusters. These findings emphasize the importance of
cluster-specific insights, enhancing interpretability and offering practical
value for buyers, sellers, and real estate analysts seeking more reliable

Method: 引入预测充分性原则，提出MPS-SSM框架，通过优化目标函数指导选择性机制，压缩历史信息并保留预测能力。

Result: MPS-SSM在多个基准数据集上表现优异，尤其在长期预测和噪声场景中显著优于现有模型，且鲁棒性更强。

Conclusion: MPS-SSM不仅性能优越，其原则还可推广为通用正则化框架，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: State Space Models (SSMs), particularly recent selective variants like Mamba,
have emerged as a leading architecture for sequence modeling, challenging the
dominance of Transformers. However, the success of these state-of-the-art
models largely relies on heuristically designed selective mechanisms, which
lack a rigorous first-principle derivation. This theoretical gap raises
questions about their optimality and robustness against spurious correlations.
To address this, we introduce the Principle of Predictive Sufficiency, a novel
information-theoretic criterion stipulating that an ideal hidden state should
be a minimal sufficient statistic of the past for predicting the future. Based
on this principle, we propose the Minimal Predictive Sufficiency State Space
Model (MPS-SSM), a new framework where the selective mechanism is guided by
optimizing an objective function derived from our principle. This approach
encourages the model to maximally compress historical information without
losing predictive power, thereby learning to ignore non-causal noise and
spurious patterns. Extensive experiments on a wide range of benchmark datasets
demonstrate that MPS-SSM not only achieves state-of-the-art performance,
significantly outperforming existing models in long-term forecasting and noisy
scenarios, but also exhibits superior robustness. Furthermore, we show that the
MPS principle can be extended as a general regularization framework to enhance
other popular architectures, highlighting its broad potential.

Abstract: Drug toxicity remains a major challenge in pharmaceutical development. Recent
machine learning models have improved in silico toxicity prediction, but their
reliance on annotated data and lack of interpretability limit their
applicability. This limits their ability to capture organ-specific toxicities
driven by complex biological mechanisms. Large language models (LLMs) offer a
promising alternative through step-by-step reasoning and integration of textual
data, yet prior approaches lack biological context and transparent rationale.
To address this issue, we propose CoTox, a novel framework that integrates LLM
with chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning for multi-toxicity prediction. CoTox
combines chemical structure data, biological pathways, and gene ontology (GO)
terms to generate interpretable toxicity predictions through step-by-step
reasoning. Using GPT-4o, we show that CoTox outperforms both traditional
machine learning and deep learning model. We further examine its performance
across various LLMs to identify where CoTox is most effective. Additionally, we
find that representing chemical structures with IUPAC names, which are easier
for LLMs to understand than SMILES, enhances the model's reasoning ability and
improves predictive performance. To demonstrate its practical utility in drug
development, we simulate the treatment of relevant cell types with drug and
incorporated the resulting biological context into the CoTox framework. This
approach allow CoTox to generate toxicity predictions aligned with
physiological responses, as shown in case study. This result highlights the
potential of LLM-based frameworks to improve interpretability and support
early-stage drug safety assessment. The code and prompt used in this work are

TL;DR: 研究发现，允许用户调整机器学习模型的预测可以减少对不完美算法决策的厌恶，但透明性对减少厌恶的影响较小且不显著。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨透明性和可调整性如何共同影响用户对算法决策的厌恶。

Method: 通过预注册用户研究（280名参与者），比较透明模型和可调整预测的效果。

Result: 可调整性显著减少厌恶，透明性影响较小且不显著，两者效果相对独立。

Conclusion: 可调整性仍是减少算法厌恶的有效方法，透明性效果有限且需进一步研究。

Abstract: Previous work has shown that allowing users to adjust a machine learning (ML)
model's predictions can reduce aversion to imperfect algorithmic decisions.
However, these results were obtained in situations where users had no
information about the model's reasoning. Thus, it remains unclear whether
interpretable ML models could further reduce algorithm aversion or even render
adjustability obsolete. In this paper, we conceptually replicate a well-known
study that examines the effect of adjustable predictions on algorithm aversion
and extend it by introducing an interpretable ML model that visually reveals
its decision logic. Through a pre-registered user study with 280 participants,
we investigate how transparency interacts with adjustability in reducing
aversion to algorithmic decision-making. Our results replicate the
adjustability effect, showing that allowing users to modify algorithmic
predictions mitigates aversion. Transparency's impact appears smaller than
expected and was not significant for our sample. Furthermore, the effects of
transparency and adjustability appear to be more independent than expected.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种新型机器学习架构，利用量子谱方法（如Pade近似和Lanczos算法）进行可解释的信号分析和符号推理，避免了传统神经网络的高维嵌入和数据密集型黑盒模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统深度学习方法缺乏透明性和物理基础，需要一种既能保持高精度又能提供可解释性和数据效率的替代方案。

Method: 通过有理谱近似将时域信号转换为稀疏的物理意义谱表示，再通过核投影函数映射为符号谓词，结合基于规则的推理引擎进行逻辑推断。

Result: 在时间序列异常检测、符号分类和混合推理任务中表现出竞争力，同时保持可解释性和数据效率。

Conclusion: 该架构为物理信息化的、具备推理能力的机器学习提供了新方向。

Abstract: We propose a novel machine learning architecture that departs from
conventional neural network paradigms by leveraging quantum spectral methods,
specifically Pade approximants and the Lanczos algorithm, for interpretable
signal analysis and symbolic reasoning. The core innovation of our approach
lies in its ability to transform raw time-domain signals into sparse,
physically meaningful spectral representations without the use of
backpropagation, high-dimensional embeddings, or data-intensive black-box
models. Through rational spectral approximation, the system extracts resonant
structures that are then mapped into symbolic predicates via a kernel
projection function, enabling logical inference through a rule-based reasoning
engine. This architecture bridges mathematical physics, sparse approximation
theory, and symbolic artificial intelligence, offering a transparent and
physically grounded alternative to deep learning models. We develop the full
mathematical formalism underlying each stage of the pipeline, provide a modular
algorithmic implementation, and demonstrate the system's effectiveness through
comparative evaluations on time-series anomaly detection, symbolic
classification, and hybrid reasoning tasks. Our results show that this
spectral-symbolic architecture achieves competitive accuracy while maintaining
interpretability and data efficiency, suggesting a promising new direction for
physically-informed, reasoning-capable machine learning.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为AS-Softmax的自适应稀疏softmax方法，解决了传统softmax在分类任务中目标分数无法达到1、训练过程过长和过拟合的问题。通过丢弃低分数类别和自适应梯度累积策略，AS-Softmax在多种任务中表现优于传统softmax及其变体，并显著提升了训练速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统softmax在分类任务中存在目标分数无法达到1的问题，导致训练过程持续且容易过拟合。此外，训练目标与测试目标不匹配，浪费了处理已正确分类样本的时间。

Method: 提出AS-Softmax，通过丢弃低分数类别，使模型专注于区分目标类别与其强对手。同时，设计了基于掩蔽样本比例的自适应梯度累积策略以加速训练。

Result: AS-Softmax在多种任务中表现优于传统softmax及其变体，且其损失与验证分类性能显著相关。自适应梯度累积策略在保持分类效果的同时，实现了约1.2倍的训练加速。

Conclusion: AS-Softmax通过合理的变换和自适应策略，有效解决了传统softmax的问题，提升了分类性能和训练效率。

Abstract: Softmax with the cross entropy loss is the standard configuration for current
neural classification models. The gold score for a target class is supposed to
be 1, but it is never reachable under the softmax schema. Such a problem makes
the training process continue forever and leads to overfitting. Moreover, the
"target-approach-1" training goal forces the model to continuously learn all
samples, leading to a waste of time in handling some samples which have already
been classified correctly with high confidence, while the test goal simply
requires the target class of each sample to hold the maximum score. To solve
the above weaknesses, we propose the Adaptive Sparse softmax (AS-Softmax) which
designs a reasonable and test-matching transformation on top of softmax. For
more purposeful learning, we discard the classes with far smaller scores
compared with the actual class during training. Then the model could focus on
learning to distinguish the target class from its strong opponents, which is
also the great challenge in test. In addition, since the training losses of
easy samples will gradually drop to 0 in AS-Softmax, we develop an adaptive
gradient accumulation strategy based on the masked sample ratio to speed up
training. We verify the proposed AS-Softmax on a variety of text multi-class,
text multi-label, text token classification, image classification and audio
classification tasks with class sizes ranging from 5 to 5000+. The results show
that AS-Softmax consistently outperforms softmax and its variants, and the loss
of AS-Softmax is remarkably correlated with classification performance in
validation. Furthermore, adaptive gradient accumulation strategy can bring
about 1.2x training speedup comparing with the standard softmax while
maintaining classification effectiveness.

Conclusion: 本文为未来研究提供了路线图，强调在机器人控制、自动驾驶等领域中利用扩展释放DRL的潜力。

Abstract: In recent years, the expansion of neural network models and training data has
driven remarkable progress in deep learning, particularly in computer vision
and natural language processing. This advancement is underpinned by the concept
of Scaling Laws, which demonstrates that scaling model parameters and training
data enhances learning performance. While these fields have witnessed
breakthroughs, such as the development of large language models like GPT-4 and
advanced vision models like Midjourney, the application of scaling laws in deep
reinforcement learning (DRL) remains relatively unexplored. Despite its
potential to improve performance, the integration of scaling laws into DRL for
decision making has not been fully realized. This review addresses this gap by
systematically analyzing scaling strategies in three dimensions: data, network,
and training budget. In data scaling, we explore methods to optimize data
efficiency through parallel sampling and data generation, examining the
relationship between data volume and learning outcomes. For network scaling, we
investigate architectural enhancements, including monolithic expansions,
ensemble and MoE methods, and agent number scaling techniques, which
collectively enhance model expressivity while posing unique computational
challenges. Lastly, in training budget scaling, we evaluate the impact of
distributed training, high replay ratios, large batch sizes, and auxiliary
training on training efficiency and convergence. By synthesizing these
strategies, this review not only highlights their synergistic roles in
advancing DRL for decision making but also provides a roadmap for future
research. We emphasize the importance of balancing scalability with
computational efficiency and outline promising directions for leveraging
scaling to unlock the full potential of DRL in various tasks such as robot
control, autonomous driving and LLM training.

Result: 首次为Heun采样器提供Wasserstein收敛界，并改进Euler采样器的结果。

Conclusion: 空间规律性和分数误差控制对收敛性至关重要，平滑Wasserstein距离可优化初始化误差界。

Abstract: We provide new convergence guarantees in Wasserstein distance for
diffusion-based generative models, covering both stochastic (DDPM-like) and
deterministic (DDIM-like) sampling methods. We introduce a simple framework to
analyze discretization, initialization, and score estimation errors. Notably,
we derive the first Wasserstein convergence bound for the Heun sampler and
improve existing results for the Euler sampler of the probability flow ODE. Our
analysis emphasizes the importance of spatial regularity of the learned score
function and argues for controlling the score error with respect to the true
reverse process, in line with denoising score matching. We also incorporate
recent results on smoothed Wasserstein distances to sharpen initialization
error bounds.

Conclusion: 研究强调了有限网络深度在分离与鲁棒性权衡中的重要性。

Abstract: Information propagation characterizes how input correlations evolve across
layers in deep neural networks. This framework has been well studied using
mean-field theory, which assumes infinitely wide networks. However, these
assumptions break down for practical, finite-size networks. In this work, we
study information propagation in randomly initialized neural networks with
finite width and reveal that the boundary between ordered and chaotic regimes
exhibits a fractal structure. This shows the fundamental complexity of neural
network dynamics, in a setting that is independent of input data and
optimization. To extend this analysis beyond multilayer perceptrons, we
leverage recently introduced Fourier-based structured transforms, and show that
information propagation in convolutional neural networks also follow the same
behavior. Our investigation highlights the importance of finite network depth
with respect to the tradeoff between separation and robustness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数据隐私需求（如GDPR和CCPA）推动了对Machine Unlearning的需求，但现有方法缺乏统计保证且计算成本高。

Method: 基于Conformal Prediction定义MU，提出ECF和EuCF指标，并设计了一种优化这些指标的实用方法。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能有效移除目标数据，并在多种场景和模型中表现良好。

Conclusion: 新方法为Machine Unlearning提供了统计保证和高效解决方案，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: The increasing demand for data privacy, driven by regulations such as GDPR
and CCPA, has made Machine Unlearning (MU) essential for removing the influence
of specific training samples from machine learning models while preserving
performance on retained data. However, most existing MU methods lack rigorous
statistical guarantees, rely on heuristic metrics, and often require
computationally expensive retraining baselines. To overcome these limitations,
we introduce a new definition for MU based on Conformal Prediction (CP),
providing statistically sound, uncertainty-aware guarantees without the need
for the concept of naive retraining. We formalize conformal criteria that
quantify how often forgotten samples are excluded from CP sets, and propose
empirical metrics,the Efficiently Covered Frequency (ECF at c) and its
complement, the Efficiently Uncovered Frequency (EuCF at d), to measure the
effectiveness of unlearning. We further present a practical unlearning method
designed to optimize these conformal metrics. Extensive experiments across
diverse forgetting scenarios, datasets and models demonstrate the efficacy of
our approach in removing targeted data.

TL;DR: HALO是一种用于实时竞价广告的后验增强学习框架，解决了传统自动竞价方法在样本效率和约束转移泛化能力上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 广告商在实时竞价系统中的异质性（如预算和ROI目标的巨大差异）导致传统自动竞价方法无法有效适应多约束环境。

Method: HALO通过后验机制重新利用探索数据，并采用B样条函数表示法，实现跨约束空间的连续、导数感知的竞价映射。

Result: 实验表明，HALO在多尺度约束下表现优异，减少了约束违规并提升了总交易额（GMV）。

Conclusion: HALO为复杂广告竞价环境提供了一种高效且适应性强的解决方案。

Abstract: Digital advertising platforms operate millisecond-level auctions through
Real-Time Bidding (RTB) systems, where advertisers compete for ad impressions
through algorithmic bids. This dynamic mechanism enables precise audience
targeting but introduces profound operational complexity due to advertiser
heterogeneity: budgets and ROI targets span orders of magnitude across
advertisers, from individual merchants to multinational brands. This diversity
creates a demanding adaptation landscape for Multi-Constraint Bidding (MCB).
Traditional auto-bidding solutions fail in this environment due to two critical
flaws: 1) severe sample inefficiency, where failed explorations under specific
constraints yield no transferable knowledge for new budget-ROI combinations,
and 2) limited generalization under constraint shifts, as they ignore physical
relationships between constraints and bidding coefficients. To address this, we
propose HALO: Hindsight-Augmented Learning for Online Auto-Bidding. HALO
introduces a theoretically grounded hindsight mechanism that repurposes all
explorations into training data for arbitrary constraint configuration via
trajectory reorientation. Further, it employs B-spline functional
representation, enabling continuous, derivative-aware bid mapping across
constraint spaces. HALO ensures robust adaptation even when budget/ROI
requirements differ drastically from training scenarios. Industrial dataset
evaluations demonstrate the superiority of HALO in handling multi-scale
constraints, reducing constraint violations while improving GMV.

Result: 模型在保持竞争力的同时，提供了高质量的逻辑解释。

Conclusion: 该框架实现了基于人类可理解的时间模式的分类，并生成局部和全局符号解释。

Abstract: Time series classification is a task of paramount importance, as this kind of
data often arises in safety-critical applications. However, it is typically
tackled with black-box deep learning methods, making it hard for humans to
understand the rationale behind their output. To take on this challenge, we
propose a neuro-symbolic framework that unifies classification and explanation
through direct embedding of trajectories into a space of Signal Temporal Logic
(STL) concepts. By introducing a novel STL-inspired kernel that maps raw time
series to their alignment with predefined STL formulae, our model jointly
optimises for accuracy and interpretability, as each prediction is accompanied
by the most relevant logical concepts that characterise it. This enables
classification grounded in human-interpretable temporal patterns and produces
both local and global symbolic explanations. Early results show competitive
performance while offering high-quality logical justifications for model
decisions.

Result: 提出了复数alpha-beta散度的闭式解，并解释了超参数的作用。

Conclusion: 该扩展在复数信号处理领域具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Divergences are fundamental to the information criteria that underpin most
signal processing algorithms. The alpha-beta family of divergences, designed
for non-negative data, offers a versatile framework that parameterizes and
continuously interpolates several separable divergences found in existing
literature. This work extends the definition of alpha-beta divergences to
accommodate complex data, specifically when the arguments of the divergence are
complex vectors. This novel formulation is designed in such a way that, by
setting the divergence hyperparameters to unity, it particularizes to the
well-known Euclidean and Mahalanobis squared distances. Other choices of
hyperparameters yield practical separable and non-separable extensions of
several classical divergences. In the context of the problem of approximating a
complex random vector, the centroid obtained by optimizing the alpha-beta mean
distortion has a closed-form expression, which interpretation sheds light on
the distinct roles of the divergence hyperparameters. These contributions may
have wide potential applicability, as there are many signal processing domains
in which the underlying data are inherently complex.

Motivation: 研究超关系知识图（HKGs）的性能优势是否源于其基础KGE模型还是扩展模块，以及分解方法对HKG信息保留的影响。

Method: 将HKGs通过三种分解方法转换为KG格式，评估经典KGE模型的性能，并提出FormerGNN框架以改进信息整合和长程依赖捕捉。

Result: 部分KGE模型在分解后的HKGs上表现接近HKGE模型，但分解方法会改变HKG拓扑结构并丢失信息。FormerGNN在实验中优于现有HKGE模型。

Conclusion: HKGE模型的性能优势部分源于其扩展模块，但信息保留和长程依赖捕捉仍需改进。FormerGNN为未来研究提供了方向。

Abstract: Recently, Hyper-relational Knowledge Graphs (HKGs) have been proposed as an
extension of traditional Knowledge Graphs (KGs) to better represent real-world
facts with additional qualifiers. As a result, researchers have attempted to
adapt classical Knowledge Graph Embedding (KGE) models for HKGs by designing
extra qualifier processing modules. However, it remains unclear whether the
superior performance of Hyper-relational KGE (HKGE) models arises from their
base KGE model or the specially designed extension module. Hence, in this
paper, we data-wise convert HKGs to KG format using three decomposition methods
and then evaluate the performance of several classical KGE models on HKGs. Our
results show that some KGE models achieve performance comparable to that of
HKGE models. Upon further analysis, we find that the decomposition methods
alter the original HKG topology and fail to fully preserve HKG information.
Moreover, we observe that current HKGE models are either insufficient in
capturing the graph's long-range dependency or struggle to integrate
main-triple and qualifier information due to the information compression issue.
To further justify our findings and offer a potential direction for future HKGE
research, we propose the FormerGNN framework. This framework employs a
qualifier integrator to preserve the original HKG topology, and a GNN-based
graph encoder to capture the graph's long-range dependencies, followed by an
improved approach for integrating main-triple and qualifier information to
mitigate compression issues. Our experimental results demonstrate that
FormerGNN outperforms existing HKGE models.

Abstract: The aim of Continual Learning (CL) is to learn new tasks incrementally while
avoiding catastrophic forgetting. Online Continual Learning (OCL) specifically
focuses on learning efficiently from a continuous stream of data with shifting
distribution. While recent studies explore Continual Learning on graphs
exploiting Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), only few of them focus on a streaming
setting. Yet, many real-world graphs evolve over time, often requiring timely
and online predictions. Current approaches, however, are not well aligned with
the standard OCL setting, partly due to the lack of a clear definition of
online Continual Learning on graphs. In this work, we propose a general
formulation for online Continual Learning on graphs, emphasizing the efficiency
requirements on batch processing over the graph topology, and providing a
well-defined setting for systematic model evaluation. Finally, we introduce a
set of benchmarks and report the performance of several methods in the CL
literature, adapted to our setting.

Result: 发现委托人的错误率在可计算的临界p值阈值下呈现单调性，从而优化决策。

Conclusion: 研究为假设检验中的策略互动提供了技术和监管视角。

Abstract: We examine hypothesis testing within a principal-agent framework, where a
strategic agent, holding private beliefs about the effectiveness of a product,
submits data to a principal who decides on approval. The principal employs a
hypothesis testing rule, aiming to pick a p-value threshold that balances false
positives and false negatives while anticipating the agent's incentive to
maximize expected profitability. Building on prior work, we develop a
game-theoretic model that captures how the agent's participation and reporting
behavior respond to the principal's statistical decision rule. Despite the
complexity of the interaction, we show that the principal's errors exhibit
clear monotonic behavior when segmented by an efficiently computable critical
p-value threshold, leading to an interpretable characterization of their
optimal p-value threshold. We empirically validate our model and these insights
using publicly available data on drug approvals. Overall, our work offers a
comprehensive perspective on strategic interactions within the hypothesis
testing framework, providing technical and regulatory insights.

Conclusion: PINO为实际海洋环境中的数据驱动波场重建和预测提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Accurate real-time prediction of phase-resolved ocean wave fields remains a
critical yet largely unsolved problem, primarily due to the absence of
practical data assimilation methods for reconstructing initial conditions from
sparse or indirect wave measurements. While recent advances in supervised deep
learning have shown potential for this purpose, they require large labelled
datasets of ground truth wave data, which are infeasible to obtain in
real-world scenarios. To overcome this limitation, we propose a
Physics-Informed Neural Operator (PINO) framework for reconstructing spatially
and temporally phase-resolved, nonlinear ocean wave fields from sparse
measurements, without the need for ground truth data during training. This is
achieved by embedding residuals of the free surface boundary conditions of
ocean gravity waves into the loss function of the PINO, constraining the
solution space in a soft manner. After training, we validate our approach using
highly realistic synthetic wave data and demonstrate the accurate
reconstruction of nonlinear wave fields from both buoy time series and radar
snapshots. Our results indicate that PINOs enable accurate, real-time
reconstruction and generalize robustly across a wide range of wave conditions,
thereby paving the way for operational, data-driven wave reconstruction and
prediction in realistic marine environments.

Abstract: Fairness is a critical requirement for Machine Learning (ML) software,
driving the development of numerous bias mitigation methods. Previous research
has identified a leveling-down effect in bias mitigation for computer vision
and natural language processing tasks, where fairness is achieved by lowering
performance for all groups without benefiting the unprivileged group. However,
it remains unclear whether this effect applies to bias mitigation for tabular
data tasks, a key area in fairness research with significant real-world
applications. This study evaluates eight bias mitigation methods for tabular
data, including both widely used and cutting-edge approaches, across 44 tasks
using five real-world datasets and four common ML models. Contrary to earlier
findings, our results show that these methods operate in a zero-sum fashion,
where improvements for unprivileged groups are related to reduced benefits for
traditionally privileged groups. However, previous research indicates that the
perception of a zero-sum trade-off might complicate the broader adoption of
fairness policies. To explore alternatives, we investigate an approach that
applies the state-of-the-art bias mitigation method solely to unprivileged
groups, showing potential to enhance benefits of unprivileged groups without
negatively affecting privileged groups or overall ML performance. Our study
highlights potential pathways for achieving fairness improvements without
zero-sum trade-offs, which could help advance the adoption of bias mitigation
methods.

TL;DR: LieQ是一种基于度量的后训练量化框架，用于在极低比特压缩下保持子7B模型的准确性，通过层级诊断自动分配比特宽度，优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型语言模型在推理过程中内存和能源占用高的问题，同时保持低比特压缩下的准确性。

Method: 引入三种层级诊断指标（困惑度下降、表示紧凑性和Top-k能量增益），实现无需梯度更新的自动比特宽度分配。

Result: 在Qwen3-4B和LLaMA3.2-3B上，LieQ在2比特量化下分别恢复95.9%和98.2%的FP16基线性能，显著优于GPTQ和AWQ。

Conclusion: LieQ为资源受限的边缘设备部署小型语言模型提供了新的范式。

Abstract: Large language models with billions of parameters are often over-provisioned:
many layers contribute little unique information yet dominate the memory and
energy footprint during inference. We present LieQ, a metric-driven
post-training quantization framework that addresses the critical challenge of
maintaining accuracy in sub-7B models under extreme low-bit compression. Our
method introduces three complementary layer-wise diagnostics-Perplexity Drop,
Representational Compactness, and Top-k Energy Gain -that reveal a canonical
division of labour across layers, enabling automatic bit-width allocation
without gradient updates. Unlike existing approaches that suffer severe
accuracy degradation at 2-3 bits precision, LieQ achieves state-of-the-art
compression-accuracy trade-offs: on Qwen3-4B, it recovers 95.9% of FP16
baseline performance at 2.05-bit quantization, outperforming GPTQ by 19.7% and
AWQ by 18.1% on average across seven zero-shot reasoning tasks. Applied to
LLaMA3.2-3B, LieQ maintains 98.2% of baseline accuracy at 2.07-bit precision
while enabling 4x memory reduction, establishing new paradigms for deploying
small language models on resource-constrained edge devices.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统热脱附光谱（TDS）方法在提取氢陷阱参数（如结合能和密度）时存在挑战，因此需要一种更直接、高效的方法。

Method: 开发了一个多神经网络模型，包括一个分类网络（预测陷阱类型数量）和一个回归网络（预测陷阱密度和结合能），并通过合成数据训练。

Result: 模型在三种不同成分的回火马氏体钢上表现出强大的预测能力。

Conclusion: 该方法为氢陷阱参数的直接预测提供了高效解决方案，并公开了相关代码。

Abstract: The hydrogen trapping behaviour of metallic alloys is generally characterised
using Thermal Desorption Spectroscopy (TDS). However, as an indirect method,
extracting key parameters (trap binding energies and densities) remains a
significant challenge. To address these limitations, this work introduces a
machine learning-based scheme for parameter identification from TDS spectra. A
multi-Neural Network (NN) model is developed and trained exclusively on
synthetic data to predict trapping parameters directly from experimental data.
The model comprises two multi-layer, fully connected, feed-forward NNs trained
with backpropagation. The first network (classification model) predicts the
number of distinct trap types. The second network (regression model) then
predicts the corresponding trap densities and binding energies. The NN
architectures, hyperparameters, and data pre-processing were optimised to
minimise the amount of training data. The proposed model demonstrated strong
predictive capabilities when applied to three tempered martensitic steels of
different compositions. The code developed is freely provided.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统分类方法在实时场景中需要持续标注的不足，实现非侵入式的高质量健康监测。

Method: 使用UniTS时间序列模型，结合可穿戴传感器和环境智能，通过异常检测而非分类方法实现监测。

Result: 在12种先进异常检测方法中表现最优，F1分数提升约22%，并在实际家庭环境中成功部署。

Conclusion: 系统证明了无需临床级设备即可实现高质量健康监测，并通过LLM增强结果的可解释性。

Abstract: We introduce AI on the Pulse, a real-world-ready anomaly detection system
that continuously monitors patients using a fusion of wearable sensors, ambient
intelligence, and advanced AI models. Powered by UniTS, a state-of-the-art
(SoTA) universal time-series model, our framework autonomously learns each
patient's unique physiological and behavioral patterns, detecting subtle
deviations that signal potential health risks. Unlike classification methods
that require impractical, continuous labeling in real-world scenarios, our
approach uses anomaly detection to provide real-time, personalized alerts for
reactive home-care interventions. Our approach outperforms 12 SoTA anomaly
detection methods, demonstrating robustness across both high-fidelity medical
devices (ECG) and consumer wearables, with a ~ 22% improvement in F1 score.
However, the true impact of AI on the Pulse lies in @HOME, where it has been
successfully deployed for continuous, real-world patient monitoring. By
operating with non-invasive, lightweight devices like smartwatches, our system
proves that high-quality health monitoring is possible without clinical-grade
equipment. Beyond detection, we enhance interpretability by integrating LLMs,
translating anomaly scores into clinically meaningful insights for healthcare
professionals.

<details>

Motivation: 药物发现过程中数据、专业知识和工具的分散导致设计周期变慢，亟需一种自动化工具来加速分子优化。

Method: 采用分层智能体框架，包括主研究员、数据库代理、AI专家、药物化学家、排名代理和科学评论家，通过工具调用和简洁的溯源记录实现分子优化。

Result: 多智能体设置显著提高了平均预测结合亲和力（31%），而单智能体生成的分子具有更好的药物性质。无引导的LLM运行最快但缺乏透明性。

Conclusion: 通过测试时间扩展、反馈循环和溯源记录，通用LLM可转化为可审计的分子设计系统，未来可扩展工具集以进一步优化药物发现流程。

Abstract: Drug discovery frequently loses momentum when data, expertise, and tools are
scattered, slowing design cycles. To shorten this loop we built a hierarchical,
tool using agent framework that automates molecular optimisation. A Principal
Researcher defines each objective, a Database agent retrieves target
information, an AI Expert generates de novo scaffolds with a sequence to
molecule deep learning model, a Medicinal Chemist edits them while invoking a
docking tool, a Ranking agent scores the candidates, and a Scientific Critic
polices the logic. Each tool call is summarised and stored causing the full
reasoning path to remain inspectable. The agents communicate through concise
provenance records that capture molecular lineage, to build auditable, molecule
centered reasoning trajectories and reuse successful transformations via in
context learning. Three cycle research loops were run against AKT1 protein
using five large language models. After ranking the models by mean docking
score, we ran 20 independent scale ups on the two top performers. We then
compared the leading LLMs' binding affinity results across three
configurations, LLM only, single agent, and multi agent. Our results reveal an
architectural trade off, the multi agent setting excelled at focused binding
optimization, improving average predicted binding affinity by 31%. In contrast,
single agent runs generated molecules with superior drug like properties at the
cost of less potent binding scores. Unguided LLM runs finished fastest, yet
their lack of transparent tool signals left the validity of their reasoning
paths unverified. These results show that test time scaling, focused feedback
loops and provenance convert general purpose LLMs into auditable systems for
molecular design, and suggest that extending the toolset to ADMET and
selectivity predictors could push research workflows further along the
discovery pipeline.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注单轮问题（如数学推理或代码生成），而忽略了需要多轮交互的真实场景（如软件工程）。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 使用改进的Decoupled Advantage Policy Optimization (DAPO)算法，基于Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct模型训练智能体。

Result: 在SWE-bench Verified基准测试中，成功率从20%提升至39%，并在SWE-rebench中表现优于其他领先模型。

Conclusion: 该方法为基于开放模型构建更强大的自主智能体提供了可行路径。

Abstract: Research on applications of Reinforcement Learning (RL) to Large Language
Models (LLMs) has mostly been focused on single-turn problems, such as
mathematical reasoning or single-shot code generation. While these problems can
be viewed as token-level multi-turn MDPs, this view corresponds to a degenerate
case of multi-turn interaction where the environment provides no feedback. This
contrasts with many real-world domains, such as software engineering (SWE),
which require rich multi-turn interactions with a stateful environment that
responds to each action with a non-trivial observation.
  To bridge this gap, we demonstrate the successful application of RL to this
general regime. Using a modified Decoupled Advantage Policy Optimization (DAPO)
algorithm, we train an agent based on Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct to solve real-world
software engineering tasks. Our approach increases the agent's success rate on
the SWE-bench Verified benchmark from a 20% rejection fine-tuned baseline to
39%, without relying on any teacher models. On SWE-rebench, our agent matches
or outperforms leading open-weight models such as DeepSeek-V3-0324 and
Qwen3-235B-A22B using an identical scaffolding, offering a viable path toward
building more capable autonomous agents for complex real-world problems based
on open models.

TL;DR: SLA-MORL是一种自适应多目标强化学习框架，用于动态分配云环境中的GPU和CPU资源，平衡训练时间、成本和SLA合规性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统静态资源分配或单目标优化方法容易导致SLA违规或资源浪费，无法满足现代机器学习工作负载的需求。

Method: SLA-MORL通过智能初始化和动态权重适应，构建21维状态表示，利用actor-critic网络进行资源分配决策。

Result: 在13种不同ML工作负载上，SLA-MORL显著减少训练时间（67.2%）、成本（68.8%）并提高SLA合规性（73.4%）。

Conclusion: SLA-MORL解决了冷启动和动态适应问题，为云资源管理提供了高效、平衡的解决方案。

Abstract: Dynamic resource allocation for machine learning workloads in cloud
environments remains challenging due to competing objectives of minimizing
training time and operational costs while meeting Service Level Agreement (SLA)
constraints. Traditional approaches employ static resource allocation or
single-objective optimization, leading to either SLA violations or resource
waste. We present SLA-MORL, an adaptive multi-objective reinforcement learning
framework that intelligently allocates GPU and CPU resources based on
user-defined preferences (time, cost, or balanced) while ensuring SLA
compliance. Our approach introduces two key innovations: (1) intelligent
initialization through historical learning or efficient baseline runs that
eliminates cold-start problems, reducing initial exploration overhead by 60%,
and (2) dynamic weight adaptation that automatically adjusts optimization
priorities based on real-time SLA violation severity, creating a
self-correcting system. SLA-MORL constructs a 21-dimensional state
representation capturing resource utilization, training progress, and SLA
compliance, enabling an actor-critic network to make informed allocation
decisions across 9 possible actions. Extensive evaluation on 13 diverse ML
workloads using production HPC infrastructure demonstrates that SLA-MORL
achieves 67.2% reduction in training time for deadline-critical jobs, 68.8%
reduction in costs for budget-constrained workloads, and 73.4% improvement in
overall SLA compliance compared to static baselines. By addressing both
cold-start inefficiency and dynamic adaptation challenges, SLA-MORL provides a
practical solution for cloud resource management that balances performance,
cost, and reliability in modern ML training environments.

TL;DR: MoKA是一种新型的Kronecker适配器，通过混合Kronecker乘积建模权重更新，解决了低秩适配器表达能力受限的问题，并在参数效率和性能之间取得了更好的平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低秩适配器在大型语言模型（LLMs）中参数效率高，但由于秩限制表达能力受限，影响复杂任务性能。

Method: 提出Mixture of Kronecker Adapters（MoKA），利用Kronecker乘积的混合建模权重更新，并引入门控机制衡量各Kronecker因子的重要性，同时通过标准矩阵运算优化硬件效率。

Result: 在指令微调和常识推理任务中，MoKA不仅优于现有PEFT基线，还将可训练参数减少27倍，实现了性能与参数效率的最佳平衡。

Conclusion: MoKA通过创新的混合Kronecker适配器设计，显著提升了参数效率和模型性能，为LLMs的高效微调提供了新思路。

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) is essential for reducing the
computational overhead of large language models (LLMs). Low-rank family
adapters are commonly used to control the parameter size efficiently while
maintaining the generative power of LLMs. However, their limited expressiveness
due to the rank constraint often restricts their performance on complex tasks.
We propose Mixture of Kronecker Adapters (MoKA), a new generation of Kronecker
adapters that addresses this limitation by modeling weight updates as a mixture
of Kronecker products. Our proposed adapter leverages a gating mechanism that
measures the importance of each Kronecker factor, enabling more expressive
adaptation. Moreover, MoKA enables a rank flexibility that provides a better
trade-off between parameter efficiency and accuracy. To ensure hardware
efficiency, we reformulate Kronecker computations using standard matrix
operations, allowing seamless deployment on GPU-optimized hardware. We conduct
extensive experiments on instruction-tuning and commonsense reasoning tasks
using low-bit quantized versions of LLaMA2-7B and LLaMA3-8B models. MoKA not
only outperforms PEFT baselines, but also reduces the number of trainable
parameters up to 27x, achieving state-of-the-art trade-offs between performance
and parameter efficiency.

TL;DR: VRPRM通过视觉推理和两阶段训练策略，以较低的数据标注成本提升了过程奖励模型（PRM）的推理能力，性能提升显著。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有PRM缺乏长期推理和深度思考能力，而引入Chain-of-Thought的PRM数据标注成本过高。

Method: 提出VRPRM，结合视觉推理，设计高效的两阶段训练策略。

Result: 仅用少量数据，VRPRM性能超越传统PRM，相对提升达118%。

Conclusion: VRPRM为PRM训练提供了高效数据利用的新范式。

Abstract: Process Reward Model (PRM) is widely used in the post-training of Large
Language Model (LLM) because it can perform fine-grained evaluation of the
reasoning steps of generated content. However, most PRMs lack long-term
reasoning and deep thinking capabilities. On the other hand, although a few
works have tried to introduce Chain-of-Thought capability into PRMs, the
annotation cost of CoT-PRM data is too expensive to play a stable role in
various tasks. To address the above challenges, we propose VRPRM, a process
reward model via visual reasoning, and design an efficient two-stage training
strategy. Experimental results show that using only 3.6K CoT-PRM SFT data and
50K non-CoT PRM RL training data, VRPRM can surpass the non-thinking PRM with a
total data volume of 400K and achieved a relative performance improvement of up
to 118\% over the base model in the BoN experiment. This result confirms that
the proposed combined training strategy can achieve higher quality reasoning
capabilities at a lower data annotation cost, thus providing a new paradigm for
PRM training with more efficient data utilization.

TL;DR: Horus是一个基于低秩适应（LoRA）的联邦学习框架，旨在解决异构性和中毒攻击问题，通过聚合LoRA而非完整模型参数来减少攻击面，并在实验中表现出优越的鲁棒性和准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习在超异构环境下易受中毒攻击，且高维模型增加了攻击面，需要一种能忽略异构性的鲁棒框架。

Method: Horus通过在稳定层插入LoRA并仅聚合LoRA，利用LoRA-A的稳定性设计中毒评分，再通过投影感知聚合机制优化客户端更新。

Result: 实验表明，Horus在多种数据集、模型架构和攻击下均优于现有基线，鲁棒性和准确性显著提升。

Conclusion: Horus通过低秩适应和异构性忽略设计，有效解决了联邦学习中的异构性和中毒攻击问题。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) remains highly vulnerable to poisoning attacks,
especially under real-world hyper-heterogeneity, where clients differ
significantly in data distributions, communication capabilities, and model
architectures. Such heterogeneity not only undermines the effectiveness of
aggregation strategies but also makes attacks more difficult to detect.
Furthermore, high-dimensional models expand the attack surface. To address
these challenges, we propose Horus, a heterogeneity-oblivious robust FL
framework centered on low-rank adaptations (LoRAs). Rather than aggregating
full model parameters, Horus inserts LoRAs into empirically stable layers and
aggregates only LoRAs to reduce the attack surface.We uncover a key empirical
observation that the input projection (LoRA-A) is markedly more stable than the
output projection (LoRA-B) under heterogeneity and poisoning. Leveraging this,
we design a Heterogeneity-Oblivious Poisoning Score using the features from
LoRA-A to filter poisoned clients. For the remaining benign clients, we propose
projection-aware aggregation mechanism to preserve collaborative signals while
suppressing drifts, which reweights client updates by consistency with the
global directions. Extensive experiments across diverse datasets, model
architectures, and attacks demonstrate that Horus consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines in both robustness and accuracy.

Motivation: 现有XAI方法缺乏统一的最优解释标准，难以客观评估和优化。

Method: 提出DeepFaith框架，结合多指标优化和高质量监督信号训练解释器。

Result: 在12个任务中，DeepFaith在10个指标上表现最优，展示了跨领域泛化能力。

Conclusion: DeepFaith为XAI提供了一种理论上的最优解释方法，显著提升了解释的可信度。

Abstract: Explainable AI (XAI) builds trust in complex systems through model
attribution methods that reveal the decision rationale. However, due to the
absence of a unified optimal explanation, existing XAI methods lack a ground
truth for objective evaluation and optimization. To address this issue, we
propose Deep architecture-based Faith explainer (DeepFaith), a domain-free and
model-agnostic unified explanation framework under the lens of faithfulness. By
establishing a unified formulation for multiple widely used and well-validated
faithfulness metrics, we derive an optimal explanation objective whose solution
simultaneously achieves optimal faithfulness across these metrics, thereby
providing a ground truth from a theoretical perspective. We design an explainer
learning framework that leverages multiple existing explanation methods,
applies deduplicating and filtering to construct high-quality supervised
explanation signals, and optimizes both pattern consistency loss and local
correlation to train a faithful explainer. Once trained, DeepFaith can generate
highly faithful explanations through a single forward pass without accessing
the model being explained. On 12 diverse explanation tasks spanning 6 models
and 6 datasets, DeepFaith achieves the highest overall faithfulness across 10
metrics compared to all baseline methods, highlighting its effectiveness and
cross-domain generalizability.

<details>

Motivation: 传统VAE训练中，随机采样潜在变量引入的梯度估计方差会减缓收敛并降低性能，需要一种更稳定的方法。

Method: 利用特定解码器架构解析计算ELBO期望值，提出零方差梯度方法，并通过动态训练策略结合解析梯度与随机估计器。

Result: 在多个数据集上验证了该方法优于现有估计器（如重参数化、Gumbel-Softmax和REINFORCE），提升了基线性能。

Conclusion: Silent Gradients为生成模型训练提供了新方向，结合了解析计算的稳定性和深度非线性架构的表达能力。

Abstract: Training deep generative models like Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) is often
hindered by the need to backpropagate gradients through the stochastic sampling
of their latent variables, a process that inherently introduces estimation
variance, which can slow convergence and degrade performance. In this paper, we
propose a new perspective that sidesteps this problem, which we call Silent
Gradients. Instead of improving stochastic estimators, we leverage specific
decoder architectures to analytically compute the expected ELBO, yielding a
gradient with zero variance. We first provide a theoretical foundation for this
method and demonstrate its superiority over existing estimators in a controlled
setting with a linear decoder. To generalize our approach for practical use
with complex, expressive decoders, we introduce a novel training dynamic that
uses the exact, zero-variance gradient to guide the early stages of encoder
training before annealing to a standard stochastic estimator. Our experiments
show that this technique consistently improves the performance of established
baselines, including reparameterization, Gumbel-Softmax, and REINFORCE, across
multiple datasets. This work opens a new direction for training generative
models by combining the stability of analytical computation with the
expressiveness of deep, nonlinear architecture.

TL;DR: VITA是一个变分预训练框架，通过利用天气变量作为代理目标，解决了农业产量预测中数据不对称的问题，显著提升了极端天气条件下的预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI模型在产量偏离历史趋势时表现不佳，主要由于预训练天气数据与微调数据之间的不对称性。

Method: VITA采用变分推理和自监督特征掩码，预训练时预测天气状态，微调时仅需基本天气统计数据。

Result: 在美国玉米带的763个县，VITA在玉米和大豆产量预测中表现最优，尤其在极端天气年份显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: VITA通过领域感知设计克服数据限制，为气候变化下的农业预测提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate crop yield forecasting is essential for global food security.
However, current AI models systematically underperform when yields deviate from
historical trends. This issue arises from key data challenges, including a
major asymmetry between rich pretraining weather datasets and the limited data
available for fine-tuning. We introduce VITA (Variational Inference Transformer
for Asymmetric data), a variational pretraining framework that addresses this
asymmetry. Instead of relying on input reconstruction, VITA uses detailed
weather variables as proxy targets during pretraining and learns to predict
rich atmospheric states through self-supervised feature masking. This allows
the model to be fine-tuned using only basic weather statistics during
deployment. Applied to 763 counties in the U.S. Corn Belt, VITA achieves
state-of-the-art performance in predicting corn and soybean yields across all
evaluation scenarios. While it consistently delivers superior performance under
normal conditions, its advantages are particularly pronounced during extreme
weather years, with statistically significant improvements (paired t-test, $p
\approx 0.01$). Importantly, VITA outperforms prior frameworks like GNN-RNN
using less data, making it more practical for real-world use--particularly in
data-scarce regions. This work highlights how domain-aware AI design can
overcome data limitations and support resilient agricultural forecasting in a
changing climate.

Method: SolarSeer利用历史卫星观测数据直接生成预测，避免了数据同化和偏微分方程求解的计算开销。

Result: SolarSeer比HRRR（最先进的NWP）在太阳辐照度预测上均方根误差降低27.28%（再分析数据）和15.35%（1800个站点），并能有效捕捉辐照度波动。

Conclusion: SolarSeer的高效和准确性为可持续能源系统的转型提供了有力支持。

Abstract: Accurate 24-hour solar irradiance forecasting is essential for the safe and
economic operation of solar photovoltaic systems. Traditional numerical weather
prediction (NWP) models represent the state-of-the-art in forecasting
performance but rely on computationally costly data assimilation and solving
complicated partial differential equations (PDEs) that simulate atmospheric
physics. Here, we introduce SolarSeer, an end-to-end large artificial
intelligence (AI) model for solar irradiance forecasting across the Contiguous
United States (CONUS). SolarSeer is designed to directly map the historical
satellite observations to future forecasts, eliminating the computational
overhead of data assimilation and PDEs solving. This efficiency allows
SolarSeer to operate over 1,500 times faster than traditional NWP, generating
24-hour cloud cover and solar irradiance forecasts for the CONUS at 5-kilometer
resolution in under 3 seconds. Compared with the state-of-the-art NWP in the
CONUS, i.e., High-Resolution Rapid Refresh (HRRR), SolarSeer significantly
reduces the root mean squared error of solar irradiance forecasting by 27.28%
in reanalysis data and 15.35% across 1,800 stations. SolarSeer also effectively
captures solar irradiance fluctuations and significantly enhances the
first-order irradiance difference forecasting accuracy. SolarSeer's ultrafast,
accurate 24-hour solar irradiance forecasts provide strong support for the
transition to sustainable, net-zero energy systems.

Abstract: Extensive research has been done on feature selection (FS) algorithms for
high-dimensional datasets aiming to improve model performance, reduce
computational cost and identify features of interest. We test the null
hypothesis of using randomly selected features to compare against features
selected by FS algorithms to validate the performance of the latter. Our
results show that FS on high-dimensional datasets (in particular gene
expression) in classification tasks is not useful. We find that (1) models
trained on small subsets (0.02%-1% of all features) of randomly selected
features almost always perform comparably to those trained on all features, and
(2) a "typical"- sized random subset provides comparable or superior
performance to that of top-k features selected in various published studies.
Thus, our work challenges many feature selection results on high dimensional
datasets, particularly in computational genomics. It raises serious concerns
about studies that propose drug design or targeted interventions based on
computationally selected genes, without further validation in a wet lab.

TL;DR: Goedel-Prover-V2是一系列开源语言模型，在自动定理证明领域达到新SOTA，通过合成数据、自我修正和模型平均等技术显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提升自动定理证明的性能，尤其是在模型规模和计算预算受限的情况下超越现有SOTA。

Method: 采用专家迭代和强化学习框架，结合合成数据生成、验证器引导的自我修正和模型平均技术。

Result: Goedel-Prover-V2-8B和32B模型在MiniF2F和PutnamBench上表现优异，超越DeepSeek-Prover-V2-671B等模型。

Conclusion: Goedel-Prover-V2是目前性能最强的开源定理证明模型，并在计算预算受限时表现优异。

Abstract: We introduce Goedel-Prover-V2, a series of open-source language models that
set a new state-of-the-art in automated theorem proving. Built on the standard
expert iteration and reinforcement learning pipeline, our approach incorporates
three key innovations: (1) Scaffolded data synthesis: We generate synthetic
tasks of increasing difficulty to train the model to master increasingly
complex theorems; (2) Verifier-guided self-correction: We enable the model to
iteratively revise its proofs by leveraging feedback from the Lean compiler;
(3) Model averaging: We merge model checkpoints to mitigate the decrease in
model output diversity in later stages of training. Our small model,
Goedel-Prover-V2-8B, reaches 84.6% pass@32 on MiniF2F and outperforms
DeepSeek-Prover-V2-671B under the same metric, despite being 80X smaller. Our
flagship model, Goedel-Prover-V2-32B, achieves 88.1% on MiniF2F at pass@32 in
standard mode and 90.4% in self-correction mode, outperforming prior SOTA by a
large margin. Additionally, our flagship model solves 86 problems on
PutnamBench at pass@184, securing the first place among open-source models on
the leaderboard, surpassing DeepSeek-Prover-V2-671B's record of solving 47
problems by pass@1024 with a significantly smaller model size and compute
budget. At the time of its release (July-August 2025), Goedel-Prover-V2
achieves the strongest overall performance among all open-source theorem
provers. It also ranks among the top-performing models--including closed-source
systems with publicly reported performance--under a constrained test-time
compute budget. Our models, code, and data are released at

*Coşku Can Horuz,Sebastian Otte,Martin V. Butz,Matthias Karlbauer*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MinConvLSTM和MinConvGRU是两种新型时空模型，结合了卷积循环网络的空间归纳偏置和高效训练的可并行RNN。通过扩展MinLSTM/MinGRU的对数域前缀和公式，实现了完全并行训练和局部空间建模，显著提升了训练速度和预测精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统ConvRNN模型在训练时存在顺序隐藏状态更新的瓶颈，限制了效率和可扩展性。本文旨在通过结合卷积结构和最小化RNN设计，解决这一问题。

Method: 将MinLSTM/MinGRU的对数域前缀和公式扩展到卷积架构，并引入xLSTM启发的指数门控机制，简化对数域计算。模型结构最小化，参数减少。

Result: 在Navier-Stokes动力学和真实世界位势数据任务中，模型训练速度显著优于标准ConvLSTM/ConvGRU，且预测误差更低。

Conclusion: 最小化循环结构与卷积输入聚合结合，为时空序列建模提供了高效且性能优越的替代方案，平衡了循环简单性和空间复杂性。

Abstract: We introduce MinConvLSTM and MinConvGRU, two novel spatiotemporal models that
combine the spatial inductive biases of convolutional recurrent networks with
the training efficiency of minimal, parallelizable RNNs. Our approach extends
the log-domain prefix-sum formulation of MinLSTM and MinGRU to convolutional
architectures, enabling fully parallel training while retaining localized
spatial modeling. This eliminates the need for sequential hidden state updates
during teacher forcing - a major bottleneck in conventional ConvRNN models. In
addition, we incorporate an exponential gating mechanism inspired by the xLSTM
architecture into the MinConvLSTM, which further simplifies the log-domain
computation. Our models are structurally minimal and computationally efficient,
with reduced parameter count and improved scalability. We evaluate our models
on two spatiotemporal forecasting tasks: Navier-Stokes dynamics and real-world
geopotential data. In terms of training speed, our architectures significantly
outperform standard ConvLSTMs and ConvGRUs. Moreover, our models also achieve
lower prediction errors in both domains, even in closed-loop autoregressive
mode. These findings demonstrate that minimal recurrent structures, when
combined with convolutional input aggregation, offer a compelling and efficient
alternative for spatiotemporal sequence modeling, bridging the gap between
recurrent simplicity and spatial complexity.

Motivation: 现有研究将样本复杂度与组件间的最小分离度挂钩，但作者认为这种观点不完整，需要更准确的衡量标准。

Method: 引入了Pair Correlation Factor (PCF)这一几何量，并在均匀球形情况下提出了一种改进的算法。

Result: PCF比最小间隔更能准确反映参数恢复的难度，且在均匀球形情况下，算法展示了样本复杂度的改进。

Conclusion: PCF为GMMs的学习提供了一种更全面的样本复杂度衡量标准，填补了现有研究的不足。

Abstract: We study the problem of learning Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) and ask:
which structural properties govern their sample complexity? Prior work has
largely tied this complexity to the minimum pairwise separation between
components, but we demonstrate this view is incomplete.
  We introduce the \emph{Pair Correlation Factor} (PCF), a geometric quantity
capturing the clustering of component means. Unlike the minimum gap, the PCF
more accurately dictates the difficulty of parameter recovery.
  In the uniform spherical case, we give an algorithm with improved sample
complexity bounds, showing when more than the usual $\epsilon^{-2}$ samples are
necessary.

TL;DR: 提出一种基于患者特异性权重的预训练模型微调方法，解决癫痫患者数据分布差异导致的跨患者问题，提升诊断性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 癫痫发作起始区（SOZ）的识别依赖专家视觉判断，机器学习辅助诊断面临跨患者数据分布差异的挑战。

Method: 先通过监督学习训练模型，再基于测试患者数据定义训练患者权重，最后用权重微调预训练模型。

Result: 实验采用留一患者法，分类准确率平均提升超10%。

Conclusion: 患者特异性权重微调方法有效提升跨患者诊断性能。

Abstract: Identifying the seizure onset zone (SOZ) in patients with focal epilepsy is
essential for surgical treatment and remains challenging due to its dependence
on visual judgment by clinical experts. The development of machine learning can
assist in diagnosis and has made promising progress. However, unlike data in
other fields, medical data is usually collected from individual patients, and
each patient has different illnesses, physical conditions, and medical
histories, which leads to differences in the distribution of each patient's
data. This makes it difficult for a machine learning model to achieve
consistently reliable performance in every new patient dataset, which we refer
to as the "cross-patient problem." In this paper, we propose a method to
fine-tune a pretrained model using patient-specific weights for every new test
patient to improve diagnostic performance. First, the supervised learning
method is used to train a machine learning model. Next, using the intermediate
features of the trained model obtained through the test patient data, the
similarity between the test patient data and each training patient's data is
defined to determine the weight of each training patient to be used in the
following fine-tuning. Finally, we fine-tune all parameters in the pretrained
model with training data and patient weights. In the experiment, the
leave-one-patient-out method is used to evaluate the proposed method, and the
results show improved classification accuracy for every test patient, with an
average improvement of more than 10%.

Conclusion: 研究结果对模型蒸馏、模块化学习和鲁棒学习系统的设计具有重要启示。

Abstract: The internal representations learned by deep networks are often sensitive to
architecture-specific choices, raising questions about the stability,
alignment, and transferability of learned structure across models. In this
paper, we investigate how structural constraints--such as linear shaping
operators and corrective paths--affect the compatibility of internal
representations across different architectures. Building on the insights from
prior studies on structured transformations and convergence, we develop a
framework for measuring and analyzing representational alignment across
networks with distinct but related architectural priors. Through a combination
of theoretical insights, empirical probes, and controlled transfer experiments,
we demonstrate that structural regularities induce representational geometry
that is more stable under architectural variation. This suggests that certain
forms of inductive bias not only support generalization within a model, but
also improve the interoperability of learned features across models. We
conclude with a discussion on the implications of representational
transferability for model distillation, modular learning, and the principled
design of robust learning systems.

Method: 研究了直接调整模型权重子集、输入可学习适配器和前缀调优等技术，用于在线微调。

Result: PEFT技术与策略预训练结合，显著减少了改进策略所需的样本量，且仅调整不到1%的参数即可提升性能。

Conclusion: PEFT方法能有效提升形态感知策略的零样本性能，同时降低计算成本。

Abstract: Morphology-aware policy learning is a means of enhancing policy sample
efficiency by aggregating data from multiple agents. These types of policies
have previously been shown to help generalize over dynamic, kinematic, and limb
configuration variations between agent morphologies. Unfortunately, these
policies still have sub-optimal zero-shot performance compared to end-to-end
finetuning on morphologies at deployment. This limitation has ramifications in
practical applications such as robotics because further data collection to
perform end-to-end finetuning can be computationally expensive. In this work,
we investigate combining morphology-aware pretraining with parameter efficient
finetuning (PEFT) techniques to help reduce the learnable parameters necessary
to specialize a morphology-aware policy to a target embodiment. We compare
directly tuning sub-sets of model weights, input learnable adapters, and prefix
tuning techniques for online finetuning. Our analysis reveals that PEFT
techniques in conjunction with policy pre-training generally help reduce the
number of samples to necessary to improve a policy compared to training models
end-to-end from scratch. We further find that tuning as few as less than 1% of
total parameters will improve policy performance compared the zero-shot
performance of the base pretrained a policy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器学习评估中的人类标注分歧常被忽视，但分歧普遍存在且影响评估可靠性。由于标注预算有限，研究如何在固定预算下优化N和K的配置具有重要意义。

Method: 分析了多个分类数据集及模拟分布，研究在固定预算（N×K）下，如何选择N和K以可靠比较模型性能。

Conclusion: 研究为机器学习实践者提供了优化评估数据收集的方法，帮助他们在有限预算下获得更可靠的评估结果。

Abstract: Reproducibility is a cornerstone of scientific validation and of the
authority it confers on its results. Reproducibility in machine learning
evaluations leads to greater trust, confidence, and value. However, the ground
truth responses used in machine learning often necessarily come from humans,
among whom disagreement is prevalent, and surprisingly little research has
studied the impact of effectively ignoring disagreement in these responses, as
is typically the case. One reason for the lack of research is that budgets for
collecting human-annotated evaluation data are limited, and obtaining more
samples from multiple annotators for each example greatly increases the
per-item annotation costs. We investigate the trade-off between the number of
items ($N$) and the number of responses per item ($K$) needed for reliable
machine learning evaluation. We analyze a diverse collection of categorical
datasets for which multiple annotations per item exist, and simulated
distributions fit to these datasets, to determine the optimal $(N, K)$
configuration, given a fixed budget ($N \times K$), for collecting evaluation
data and reliably comparing the performance of machine learning models. Our
findings show, first, that accounting for human disagreement may come with $N
\times K$ at no more than 1000 (and often much lower) for every dataset tested
on at least one metric. Moreover, this minimal $N \times K$ almost always
occurred for $K > 10$. Furthermore, the nature of the tradeoff between $K$ and
$N$ -- or if one even existed -- depends on the evaluation metric, with metrics
that are more sensitive to the full distribution of responses performing better
at higher levels of $K$. Our methods can be used to help ML practitioners get
more effective test data by finding the optimal metrics and number of items and
annotations per item to collect to get the most reliability for their budget.

<details>

Motivation: 大型语言模型虽然能生成流畅的输出，但缺乏可验证的保证，因此需要一种机制来确保其行为的合规性和可靠性。

Method: 引入合约层，通过设计合约和类型理论原则，为LLM的每次调用设定语义和类型要求，并结合概率性修复机制引导生成合规输出。

Result: 合约层实现了对LLM的语义和类型约束，并通过概率性验证确保输出合规，同时将LLM视为语义解析器和概率黑盒组件的双重角色。

Conclusion: 该工作提出了一种通过合约实现LLM合规性的方法，并认为满足相同合约的代理在功能上是等效的。

Abstract: Generative models, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), produce fluent
outputs yet lack verifiable guarantees. We adapt Design by Contract (DbC) and
type-theoretic principles to introduce a contract layer that mediates every LLM
call. Contracts stipulate semantic and type requirements on inputs and outputs,
coupled with probabilistic remediation to steer generation toward compliance.
The layer exposes the dual view of LLMs as semantic parsers and probabilistic
black-box components. Contract satisfaction is probabilistic and semantic
validation is operationally defined through programmer-specified conditions on
well-typed data structures. More broadly, this work postulates that any two
agents satisfying the same contracts are \emph{functionally equivalent} with
respect to those contracts.

Conclusion: SkyGP为高斯过程在实时流数据中的应用提供了高效且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Gaussian Processes (GPs), as a nonparametric learning method, offer flexible
modeling capabilities and calibrated uncertainty quantification for function
approximations. Additionally, GPs support online learning by efficiently
incorporating new data with polynomial-time computation, making them
well-suited for safety-critical dynamical systems that require rapid
adaptation. However, the inference and online updates of exact GPs, when
processing streaming data, incur cubic computation time and quadratic storage
memory complexity, limiting their scalability to large datasets in real-time
settings. In this paper, we propose a \underline{s}treaming
\underline{k}ernel-induced progressivel\underline{y} generated expert framework
of \underline{G}aussian \underline{p}rocesses (SkyGP) that addresses both
computational and memory constraints by maintaining a bounded set of experts,
while inheriting the learning performance guarantees from exact Gaussian
processes. Furthermore, two SkyGP variants are introduced, each tailored to a
specific objective, either maximizing prediction accuracy (SkyGP-Dense) or
improving computational efficiency (SkyGP-Fast). The effectiveness of SkyGP is
validated through extensive benchmarks and real-time control experiments
demonstrating its superior performance compared to state-of-the-art approaches.

Conclusion: 结论表明，语言模型可以通过自我生成问题和答案持续改进，无需依赖外部数据集。

Abstract: Can large language models improve without external data -- by generating
their own questions and answers? We hypothesize that a pre-trained language
model can improve its reasoning skills given only a single prompt specifying
the topic (e.g., algebra word problems) and asking the model to generate its
own questions. To do this, we propose Self-Questioning Language Models (SQLM):
an asymmetric self-play framework where a proposer is given the topic and
generates a question for a solver, who tries to answer it. Both the proposer
and solver are trained via reinforcement learning. The proposer receives a
reward if the problem is not too easy or too difficult, and the solver receives
a reward based on majority voting, a proxy for correctness in the absence of
ground-truth answers. For coding, the proposer can instead generate unit tests
which are used for verification. We study this asymmetric self-play framework
on three benchmarks: three-digit multiplication, algebra problems from the
OMEGA benchmark, and programming problems from Codeforces. By continually
generating more interesting problems and attempting to solve them, language
models can improve on downstream benchmarks without access to any curated
training datasets.

Result: 理论证明了收敛界限，实验表明PAC-EIG能高效识别需要进一步演示的状态，优于传统方法。

Conclusion: PAC-EIG为主动IRL提供了首个理论保证，适用于需要高可靠性的领域（如自动驾驶和机器人）。

Abstract: As AI systems become increasingly autonomous, reliably aligning their
decision-making to human preferences is essential. Inverse reinforcement
learning (IRL) offers a promising approach to infer preferences from
demonstrations. These preferences can then be used to produce an apprentice
policy that performs well on the demonstrated task. However, in domains like
autonomous driving or robotics, where errors can have serious consequences, we
need not just good average performance but reliable policies with formal
guarantees -- yet obtaining sufficient human demonstrations for reliability
guarantees can be costly. Active IRL addresses this challenge by strategically
selecting the most informative scenarios for human demonstration. We introduce
PAC-EIG, an information-theoretic acquisition function that directly targets
probably-approximately-correct (PAC) guarantees for the learned policy --
providing the first such theoretical guarantee for active IRL with noisy expert
demonstrations. Our method maximises information gain about the regret of the
apprentice policy, efficiently identifying states requiring further
demonstration. We also present Reward-EIG as an alternative when learning the
reward itself is the primary objective. Focusing on finite state-action spaces,
we prove convergence bounds, illustrate failure modes of prior heuristic
methods, and demonstrate our method's advantages experimentally.

Abstract: Evaluating teaching effectiveness at scale remains a persistent challenge for
large universities, particularly within engineering programs that enroll tens
of thousands of students. Traditional methods, such as manual review of student
evaluations, are often impractical, leading to overlooked insights and
inconsistent data use. This article presents a scalable, AI-supported framework
for synthesizing qualitative student feedback using large language models. The
system employs hierarchical summarization, anonymization, and exception
handling to extract actionable themes from open-ended comments while upholding
ethical safeguards. Visual analytics contextualize numeric scores through
percentile-based comparisons, historical trends, and instructional load. The
approach supports meaningful evaluation and aligns with best practices in
qualitative analysis and educational assessment, incorporating student, peer,
and self-reflective inputs without automating personnel decisions. We report on
its successful deployment across a large college of engineering. Preliminary
validation through comparisons with human reviewers, faculty feedback, and
longitudinal analysis suggests that LLM-generated summaries can reliably
support formative evaluation and professional development. This work
demonstrates how AI systems, when designed with transparency and shared
governance, can promote teaching excellence and continuous improvement at scale
within academic institutions.

Abstract: AI policy should advance AI innovation by ensuring that its potential
benefits are responsibly realized and widely shared. To achieve this, AI
policymaking should place a premium on evidence: Scientific understanding and
systematic analysis should inform policy, and policy should accelerate evidence
generation. But policy outcomes reflect institutional constraints, political
dynamics, electoral pressures, stakeholder interests, media environment,
economic considerations, cultural contexts, and leadership perspectives. Adding
to this complexity is the reality that the broad reach of AI may mean that
evidence and policy are misaligned: Although some evidence and policy squarely
address AI, much more partially intersects with AI. Well-designed policy should
integrate evidence that reflects scientific understanding rather than hype. An
increasing number of efforts address this problem by often either (i)
contributing research into the risks of AI and their effective mitigation or
(ii) advocating for policy to address these risks. This paper tackles the hard
problem of how to optimize the relationship between evidence and policy to
address the opportunities and challenges of increasingly powerful AI.

Conclusion: “Cyber Humanities”不仅是现有实践的延伸，而是后数字时代人文研究的新范式。

Abstract: The accelerated evolution of digital infrastructures and algorithmic systems
is reshaping how the humanities engage with knowledge and culture. Rooted in
the traditions of Digital Humanities and Digital Humanism, the concept of
"Cyber Humanities" proposes a critical reconfiguration of humanistic inquiry
for the post-digital era. This Manifesto introduces a flexible framework that
integrates ethical design, sustainable digital practices, and participatory
knowledge systems grounded in human-centered approaches. By means of a
Decalogue of foundational principles, the Manifesto invites the scientific
community to critically examine and reimagine the algorithmic infrastructures
that influence culture, creativity, and collective memory.
  Rather than being a simple extension of existing practices, "Cyber
Humanities" should be understood as a foundational paradigm for humanistic
inquiry in a computationally mediated world.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究UAD 3.6结构化报告要求与AI技术结合对房产评估市场的影响，解决传统评估中的制度性问题和偏见。

Method: 开发了一个三层框架，涵盖物理数据采集、语义理解和认知推理，整合新兴技术并保持专业监督。

Result: 揭示了标准化与AI结合如何重构市场，提出了满足金融应用信任需求的解决方案。

Conclusion: 成功转型需技术与人文结合，AI应增强而非替代专业判断，同时解决历史偏见和信息不对称。

Abstract: The Uniform Appraisal Dataset (UAD) 3.6's mandatory 2026 implementation
transforms residential property valuation from narrative reporting to
structured, machine-readable formats. This paper provides the first
comprehensive analysis of this regulatory shift alongside concurrent AI
advances in computer vision, natural language processing, and autonomous
systems. We develop a three-layer framework for AI-augmented valuation
addressing technical implementation and institutional trust requirements. Our
analysis reveals how regulatory standardization converging with AI capabilities
enables fundamental market restructuring with profound implications for
professional practice, efficiency, and systemic risk. We make four key
contributions: (1) documenting institutional failures including inter-appraiser
variability and systematic biases undermining valuation reliability; (2)
developing an architectural framework spanning physical data acquisition,
semantic understanding, and cognitive reasoning that integrates emerging
technologies while maintaining professional oversight; (3) addressing trust
requirements for high-stakes financial applications including regulatory
compliance, algorithmic fairness, and uncertainty quantification; (4) proposing
evaluation methodologies beyond generic AI benchmarks toward domain-specific
protocols. Our findings indicate successful transformation requires not merely
technological sophistication but careful human-AI collaboration, creating
systems that augment rather than replace professional expertise while
addressing historical biases and information asymmetries in real estate
markets.

TL;DR: 研究表明大型语言模型（LLM）能学习人类合理性判断的模式，并在法律情境中模拟人类行为，优先社会线索而非经济效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 法律系统中法官的直觉可能与广泛社会观点不一致，研究旨在探索LLM是否能捕捉人类合理性判断的驱动模式。

Method: 通过随机对照试验，比较人类和模型在多个法律情境中的10,000多次模拟判断。

Result: 某些模型不仅能捕捉表面反应，还可能模拟其决策架构，优先社会线索而非经济效率。

Conclusion: 研究为法官、立法者和诉讼当事人提供实用工具，并强调理解AI伦理框架对预测其行为的重要性。

Abstract: In everyday life, people make countless reasonableness judgments that
determine appropriate behavior in various contexts. Predicting these judgments
challenges the legal system, as judges' intuitions may not align with broader
societal views. This Article investigates whether large language models (LLMs)
can learn to identify patterns driving human reasonableness judgments.
  Using randomized controlled trials comparing humans and models across
multiple legal contexts with over 10,000 simulated judgments, we demonstrate
that certain models capture not just surface-level responses but potentially
their underlying decisional architecture. Strikingly, these systems prioritize
social cues over economic efficiency in negligence determinations, mirroring
human behavior despite contradicting textbook treatments.
  These findings suggest practical applications: judges could calibrate
intuitions against broader patterns, lawmakers could test policy
interpretations, and resource-constrained litigants could preview argument
reception. As AI agents increasingly make autonomous real-world decisions,
understanding whether they've internalized recognizable ethical frameworks
becomes essential for anticipating their behavior.

Abstract: The convergence of Web3 technologies and AI agents represents a rapidly
evolving frontier poised to reshape decentralized ecosystems. This paper
presents the first and most comprehensive analysis of the intersection between
Web3 and AI agents, examining five critical dimensions: landscape, economics,
governance, security, and trust mechanisms. Through an analysis of 133 existing
projects, we first develop a taxonomy and systematically map the current market
landscape (RQ1), identifying distinct patterns in project distribution and
capitalization. Building upon these findings, we further investigate four key
integrations: (1) the role of AI agents in participating in and optimizing
decentralized finance (RQ2); (2) their contribution to enhancing Web3
governance mechanisms (RQ3); (3) their capacity to strengthen Web3 security via
intelligent vulnerability detection and automated smart contract auditing
(RQ4); and (4) the establishment of robust reliability frameworks for AI agent
operations leveraging Web3's inherent trust infrastructure (RQ5). By
synthesizing these dimensions, we identify key integration patterns, highlight
foundational challenges related to scalability, security, and ethics, and
outline critical considerations for future research toward building robust,
intelligent, and trustworthy decentralized systems with effective AI agent
interactions.

<details>

Motivation: 现有AI公平性研究多关注西方社区，忽视全球南方国家和边缘群体，需填补这一空白。

Method: 分析13个全球南方国家和3个全球北方国家的GAI生成图像，对比日常活动中的服饰和文化特征。

Result: 全球南方国家图像中服饰和文化特征被过度放大，显示异化现象；边缘群体在西方和非西方背景下均受影响。

Conclusion: 需通过社区中心化设计改进GAI工具，减少异化现象和潜在危害。

Abstract: A significant majority of AI fairness research studying the harmful outcomes
of GAI tools have overlooked non-Western communities and contexts,
necessitating a stronger coverage in this vein. We extend our previous work on
exoticism (Ghosh et al., 2024) of 'Global South' countries from across the
world, as depicted by GAI tools. We analyze generated images of individuals
from 13 countries -- India, Bangladesh, Papua New Guinea, Egypt, Ethiopia,
Tunisia, Sudan, Libya, Venezuela, Colombia, Indonesia, Honduras, and Mexico --
performing everyday activities (such as being at home, going to work, getting
groceries, etc.), as opposed to images for the same activities being performed
by persons from 3 'Global North' countries -- USA, UK, Australia. While outputs
for 'Global North' demonstrate a difference across images and people clad in
activity-appropriate attire, individuals from 'Global South' countries are
depicted in similar attire irrespective of the performed activity, indicative
of a pattern of exoticism where attire or other cultural features are
overamplified at the cost of accuracy. We further show qualitatively-analyzed
case studies that demonstrate how exoticism is not simply performed upon
'Global South' countries but also upon marginalized populations even in Western
contexts, as we observe a similar exoticization of Indigenous populations in
the 'Global North', and doubly upon marginalized populations within 'Global
South' countries. We document implications for harm-aware usage patterns of
such tools, and steps towards designing better GAI tools through
community-centered endeavors.

Motivation: 现有‘负责任AI’范式虽重要，但未能系统考虑AI的社会影响，需引入‘自由’概念以弥补不足。

Method: 结合康德哲学及当代解释，提出‘自由’的两个维度（能力与机会），并基于可持续发展目标构建原型框架。

Result: 原型框架为政策制定提供了初步工具，系统评估AI对社会的影响。

Conclusion: 该框架是迈向全面操作化‘自由’概念的第一步，旨在补充现有风险导向的AI监管方法。

Abstract: In the discourse on AI regulation, 'responsible AI' is the dominant paradigm,
with the focus on mitigating the risks related to AI systems. While this focus
is important and necessary, it has limited use for a systematic consideration
of AI's societal impact. This paper proposes a proto-framework for assessing
the societal impact of AI systems by operationalising the concept of freedom.
This proto-framework is intended as a step towards a fully operationalised
framework to be used in policymaking contexts. By drawing on Kantian philosophy
and related contemporary interpretations, freedom is developed as the
counterpart to the concept of responsibility. Two dimensions of freedom are
developed in further detail: freedom as capability and freedom as opportunity.
These two dimensions of freedom are then applied in a proto-framework that
systematically considers AI's impact on society using the Sustainable
Development Goals. This proto-framework aims to complement current risk-based
approaches and thereby offers a first step towards operationalising the concept
of freedom in AI regulation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM驱动代理的复杂性增加，其成本问题威胁到可扩展性和可访问性，因此需要研究如何在不牺牲性能的情况下设计成本效益高的代理系统。

Method: 通过实证分析GAIA基准，评估LLM主干选择、代理框架设计和测试时扩展策略的影响，使用cost-of-pass指标量化效率与性能的权衡。

Result: 提出的Efficient Agents框架在保持96.7%性能的同时，将运营成本从0.398美元降至0.228美元，成本效率提升28.4%。

Conclusion: 研究为设计高效、高性能的代理系统提供了实用见解，推动了AI驱动解决方案的可访问性和可持续性。

Abstract: The remarkable capabilities of Large Language Model (LLM)-driven agents have
enabled sophisticated systems to tackle complex, multi-step tasks, but their
escalating costs threaten scalability and accessibility. This work presents the
first systematic study of the efficiency-effectiveness trade-off in modern
agent systems, addressing the critical need for cost-effective designs without
sacrificing performance. We investigate three key questions: (1) How much
complexity do agentic tasks inherently require? (2) When do additional modules
yield diminishing returns? (3) How much efficiency can be gained through the
design of efficient agent frameworks? Through an empirical analysis on the GAIA
benchmark, we evaluate the impact of LLM backbone selection, agent framework
designs, and test-time scaling strategies. Using the cost-of-pass metric, we
quantify the efficiency-performance trade-off across these dimensions. Our
findings inform the development of Efficient Agents , a novel agent framework
that has an optimal complexity to task requirements. Efficient Agents retains
96.7% of the performance of OWL, one leading open-source agent framework, while
reducing operational costs from $0.398 to $0.228, resulting in a 28.4%
improvement in cost-of-pass. Our work provides actionable insights for
designing efficient, high-performing agent systems, advancing the accessibility
and sustainability of AI-driven solutions.

Motivation: 解决传统规划中对象集固定不变的局限性，适应动态对象变化的实际需求。

Method: 基于一阶逻辑构建规划问题，限制初始理论为有限的流畅文字集，并约束计划长度为有限整数。

Result: 证明了方法的完备性和可靠性，适用于无DCA的有界规划问题。

Conclusion: 方法为动态对象规划提供了理论基础，并通过概念验证实现展示了可行性。

Abstract: In classical planning and conformant planning, it is assumed that there are
finitely many named objects given in advance, and only they can participate in
actions and in fluents. This is the Domain Closure Assumption (DCA). However,
there are practical planning problems where the set of objects changes
dynamically as actions are performed; e.g., new objects can be created, old
objects can be destroyed. We formulate the planning problem in first-order
logic, assume an initial theory is a finite consistent set of fluent literals,
discuss when this guarantees that in every situation there are only finitely
many possible actions, impose a finite integer bound on the length of the plan,
and propose to organize search over sequences of actions that are grounded at
planning time. We show the soundness and completeness of our approach. It can
be used to solve the bounded planning problems without DCA that belong to the
intersection of sequential generalized planning (without sensing actions) and
conformant planning, restricted to the case without the disjunction over fluent
literals. We discuss a proof-of-the-concept implementation of our planner.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LBS数据的稀疏性导致活动序列不完整，难以准确推断出行和活动。研究旨在利用高质量LBS数据恢复个体层面的不完整序列。

Method: 结合Insertion Transformer的灵活序列构建和Variable Selection Network的动态协变量处理能力，提出VSNIT方法。

Result: VSNIT能插入更多样、真实的活动模式，更接近现实世界的变化，并更有效地恢复活动序列。

Conclusion: VSNIT在活动序列恢复任务中表现出更高的准确性和多样性，为未来基于位置的研究和应用提供了有前景的框架。

Abstract: Location-Based Service (LBS) data provides critical insights into human
mobility, yet its sparsity often yields incomplete trip and activity sequences,
making accurate inferences about trips and activities difficult. We raise a
research problem: Can we use activity sequences derived from high-quality LBS
data to recover incomplete activity sequences at the individual level? This
study proposes a new solution, the Variable Selection Network-fused Insertion
Transformer (VSNIT), integrating the Insertion Transformer's flexible sequence
construction with the Variable Selection Network's dynamic covariate handling
capability, to recover missing segments in incomplete activity sequences while
preserving existing data. The findings show that VSNIT inserts more diverse,
realistic activity patterns, more closely matching real-world variability, and
restores disrupted activity transitions more effectively aligning with the
target. It also performs significantly better than the baseline model across
all metrics. These results highlight VSNIT's superior accuracy and diversity in
activity sequence recovery tasks, demonstrating its potential to enhance LBS
data utility for mobility analysis. This approach offers a promising framework
for future location-based research and applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI框架在科学发现中缺乏透明性和可控性，科学家需要既能准确推理又能灵活调整的AI工具。

Method: CLIO通过动态优化实现LLM的自我调整和问题解决，提供透明的推理过程和可干预的设计。

Result: CLIO在生物学和医学问题上比基础GPT-4.1模型提升了13.82%的绝对准确率（相对提升161.64%），并揭示了内部不确定性波动对结果的影响。

Conclusion: CLIO为科学决策提供了透明且可控的AI工具，其设计机制为未来AI在科学领域的应用提供了新方向。

Abstract: The capacity for artificial intelligence (AI) to formulate, evolve, and test
altered thought patterns under dynamic conditions indicates advanced cognition
that is crucial for scientific discovery. The existing AI development landscape
falls into two categories: 1) frameworks over non-reasoning models that
natively incorporate opinions on how humans think, and 2) reasoning models that
abstract precise control of the reasoning intuition away from end users. While
powerful, for scientists to maximize utility of AI in scientific discovery,
they not only require accuracy and transparency in reasoning, but also
steerability. Hence, we introduce an alternative approach that enables deep and
precise control over the reasoning process called: a cognitive loop via in-situ
optimization (CLIO). CLIO enables large language models (LLMs) to
self-formulate ways of approaching a problem, adapt behavior when
self-confidence is low, and ultimately provide scientists with a final belief
or answer. Through CLIO's open design, scientists can observe uncertainty
levels, understand how final belief states are formulated using graph
structures, and interject corrections. Without any further post-training,
OpenAI's GPT-4.1 with CLIO yields an accuracy of 22.37\% in text-based biology
and medicine questions on Humanity's Last Exam (HLE). This yields a 13.82\% net
or 161.64\% relative increase when compared to the base GPT-4.1 model and
surpasses OpenAI's o3 performance in high and low reasoning effort modes. We
further discovered that oscillations within internal uncertainty measures are
key in determining the accuracy of CLIO's results, revealing how its open
design and internal mechanisms can provide insight and control into scientific
decision-making processes.

Abstract: Radiology visual question answering (RVQA) provides precise answers to
questions about chest X-ray images, alleviating radiologists' workload. While
recent methods based on multimodal large language models (MLLMs) and
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) have shown promising progress in RVQA,
they still face challenges in factual accuracy, hallucinations, and cross-modal
misalignment. We introduce a multi-agent system (MAS) designed to support
complex reasoning in RVQA, with specialized agents for context understanding,
multimodal reasoning, and answer validation. We evaluate our system on a
challenging RVQA set curated via model disagreement filtering, comprising
consistently hard cases across multiple MLLMs. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of our system over strong MLLM
baselines, with a case study illustrating its reliability and interpretability.
This work highlights the potential of multi-agent approaches to support
explainable and trustworthy clinical AI applications that require complex
reasoning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有规划基准测试要么任务定义模糊（如旅行规划），要么基于国际规划竞赛的问题，无法有效衡量模型的规划能力。

Method: 通过Countdown游戏设计规划基准测试，该问题具有自然语言描述、计算复杂性（NP完全）和丰富的实例空间。

Result: 理论分析表明该问题具有计算复杂性，实例生成优于公共基准测试。实验显示现有LLM辅助规划方法在该动态基准上表现不佳。

Conclusion: Countdown基准测试为评估规划能力提供了更有效的工具，现有LLM方法仍面临挑战。

Abstract: There is a broad consensus that the inability to form long-term plans is one
of the key limitations of current foundational models and agents. However, the
existing planning benchmarks remain woefully inadequate to truly measure their
planning capabilities. Most existing benchmarks either focus on loosely defined
tasks like travel planning or end up leveraging existing domains and problems
from international planning competitions. While the former tasks are hard to
formalize and verify, the latter were specifically designed to test and
challenge the weaknesses of existing automated planners. To address these
shortcomings, we propose a procedure for creating a planning benchmark centered
around the game called Countdown, where a player is expected to form a target
number from a list of input numbers through arithmetic operations. We discuss
how this problem meets many of the desiderata associated with an ideal
benchmark for planning capabilities evaluation. Specifically, the domain allows
for an intuitive, natural language description for each problem instance, it is
computationally challenging (NP-complete), and the instance space is rich
enough that we do not have to worry about memorization. We perform an extensive
theoretical analysis, establishing the computational complexity result and
demonstrate the advantage of our instance generation procedure over public
benchmarks. We evaluate a variety of existing LLM-assisted planning methods on
instances generated using our procedure. Our results show that, unlike other
domains like 24 Game (a special case of Countdown), our proposed dynamic
benchmark remains extremely challenging for existing LLM-based approaches.

Abstract: Post-training methods have improved the performance and enhanced the

is challenging for Japanese LLMs to achieve due to the amount of resources
required. Inspired by task vectors that extract the change of weights before
and after training, specifically for a certain task, we obtain reasoning
vectors from reasoning LLMs and apply them to Japanese LLMs to boost their
performance. While the resources available present a challenge to improve
Japanese LLMs, we present a simple and effective way to obtain high improvement
and hope to inspire for other languages.

TL;DR: PentestJudge是一个基于大型语言模型（LLM）的系统，用于评估渗透测试代理的操作，通过分层任务分解和简单标准判断，其性能接近人类专家。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法难以程序化评估渗透测试代理的操作质量，需要一种可扩展且高效的评估系统。

Method: 开发分层任务结构的评分标准，将复杂任务分解为简单子任务，利用LLM作为裁判评估代理行为。

Result: 最佳模型的F1分数达到0.83，工具使用能力强的模型更接近人类专家表现。

Conclusion: PentestJudge展示了LLM在评估渗透测试任务中的潜力，验证可能比生成更容易，为未来研究提供了方法论支持。

Abstract: We introduce PentestJudge, a system for evaluating the operations of
penetration testing agents. PentestJudge is a large language model
(LLM)-as-judge with access to tools that allow it to consume arbitrary
trajectories of agent states and tool call history to determine whether a
security agent's actions meet certain operating criteria that would be
impractical to evaluate programmatically. We develop rubrics that use a tree
structure to hierarchically collapse the penetration testing task for a
particular environment into smaller, simpler, and more manageable sub-tasks and
criteria until each leaf node represents simple yes-or-no criteria for
PentestJudge to evaluate. Task nodes are broken down into different categories
related to operational objectives, operational security, and tradecraft.
LLM-as-judge scores are compared to human domain experts as a ground-truth
reference, allowing us to compare their relative performance with standard
binary classification metrics, such as F1 scores. We evaluate several frontier
and open-source models acting as judge agents, with the best model reaching an
F1 score of 0.83. We find models that are better at tool-use perform more
closely to human experts. By stratifying the F1 scores by requirement type, we
find even models with similar overall scores struggle with different types of
questions, suggesting certain models may be better judges of particular
operating criteria. We find that weaker and cheaper models can judge the
trajectories of pentests performed by stronger and more expensive models,
suggesting verification may be easier than generation for the penetration
testing task. We share this methodology to facilitate future research in
understanding the ability of judges to holistically and scalably evaluate the
process quality of AI-based information security agents so that they may be
confidently used in sensitive production environments.

Result: 初步实验表明，AQUAH能够完成冷启动模拟并生成分析师就绪的文档，结果被专家评价为清晰、透明且物理合理。

Conclusion: 尽管仍需进一步校准和验证，但AQUAH展示了基于LLM和视觉的代理在环境建模中的潜力。

Abstract: We introduce AQUAH, the first end-to-end language-based agent designed
specifically for hydrologic modeling. Starting from a simple natural-language
prompt (e.g., 'simulate floods for the Little Bighorn basin from 2020 to
2022'), AQUAH autonomously retrieves the required terrain, forcing, and gauge
data; configures a hydrologic model; runs the simulation; and generates a
self-contained PDF report. The workflow is driven by vision-enabled large
language models, which interpret maps and rasters on the fly and steer key
decisions such as outlet selection, parameter initialization, and uncertainty
commentary. Initial experiments across a range of U.S. basins show that AQUAH
can complete cold-start simulations and produce analyst-ready documentation
without manual intervention. The results are judged by hydrologists as clear,
transparent, and physically plausible. While further calibration and validation
are still needed for operational deployment, these early outcomes highlight the
promise of LLM-centered, vision-grounded agents to streamline complex
environmental modeling and lower the barrier between Earth observation data,
physics-based tools, and decision makers.

TL;DR: Medblink是一个评估多模态语言模型（MLMs）在医学图像感知任务中表现的基准测试，结果显示当前模型在简单感知任务上表现不佳，需改进视觉基础以支持临床应用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床医生对AI工具的选择性很高，模型在简单感知任务上的错误会影响其临床采用，因此需要评估和改进MLMs的感知能力。

Method: 引入Medblink基准测试，涵盖8个临床相关任务和1,605张图像，评估19种先进MLMs的表现。

Result: 人类标注者准确率为96.4%，而最佳模型仅达65%，表明当前MLMs在感知任务上表现不足。

Conclusion: 需加强MLMs的视觉基础能力，以提升其在临床决策支持中的实用性。

Abstract: Multimodal language models (MLMs) show promise for clinical decision support
and diagnostic reasoning, raising the prospect of end-to-end automated medical
image interpretation. However, clinicians are highly selective in adopting AI
tools; a model that makes errors on seemingly simple perception tasks such as
determining image orientation or identifying whether a CT scan is
contrast-enhance are unlikely to be adopted for clinical tasks. We introduce
Medblink, a benchmark designed to probe these models for such perceptual
abilities. Medblink spans eight clinically meaningful tasks across multiple
imaging modalities and anatomical regions, totaling 1,429 multiple-choice
questions over 1,605 images. We evaluate 19 state-of-the-art MLMs, including
general purpose (GPT4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet) and domain specific (Med Flamingo,
LLaVA Med, RadFM) models. While human annotators achieve 96.4% accuracy, the
best-performing model reaches only 65%. These results show that current MLMs
frequently fail at routine perceptual checks, suggesting the need to strengthen
their visual grounding to support clinical adoption. Data is available on our
project page.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Polymath是一种自优化代理，通过动态分层工作流解决现实世界动态问题，无需标记数据，性能提升8.1%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手动构建通用代理效率低且难以扩展，现有方法依赖标记数据，无法解决动态问题。

Method: 结合任务流图的灵活性和代码表示工作流的表达能力，采用多网格图优化和自反射进化算法优化工作流。

Result: 在六个基准数据集上，Polymath平均性能提升8.1%。

Conclusion: Polymath为动态问题提供了一种高效、无需标记数据的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at solving complex tasks by executing
agentic workflows composed of detailed instructions and structured operations.
Yet, building general-purpose agents by manually embedding foundation models
into agentic systems such as Chain-of-Thought, Self-Reflection, and ReACT
through text interfaces limits scalability and efficiency. Recently, many
researchers have sought to automate the generation and optimization of these
workflows through code-based representations. However, existing methods often
rely on labeled datasets to train and optimize workflows, making them
ineffective and inflexible for solving real-world, dynamic problems where
labeled data is unavailable. To address this challenge, we introduce Polymath,
a self-optimizing agent with dynamic hierarchical workflow that leverages the
flexibility of task flow graphs and the expressiveness of code-represented
workflows to solve a wide range of real-world, dynamic problems. The proposed
optimization methodology integrates multi-grid-inspired graph optimization with
a self-reflection-guided evolutionary algorithm to refine workflows without
labeled data. Experimental results on six benchmark datasets across coding,
math, and multi-turn QA tasks show that Polymath achieves 8.1% average
improvement over state-of-the-art baselines.

Result: 在多个LLM和数据集上测试，防御成功率显著提升，部分模型在增强模式下实现近乎完美防御。

Conclusion: 该方法为LLM伦理提供了一种轻量、低成本的解决方案，适用于多种GenAI应用场景。

Abstract: This paper introduces a novel self-consciousness defense mechanism for Large
Language Models (LLMs) to combat prompt injection attacks. Unlike traditional
approaches that rely on external classifiers, our method leverages the LLM's
inherent reasoning capabilities to perform self-protection. We propose a
framework that incorporates Meta-Cognitive and Arbitration Modules, enabling
LLMs to evaluate and regulate their own outputs autonomously. Our approach is
evaluated on seven state-of-the-art LLMs using two datasets: AdvBench and
Prompt-Injection-Mixed-Techniques-2024. Experiment results demonstrate
significant improvements in defense success rates across models and datasets,
with some achieving perfect and near-perfect defense in Enhanced Mode. We also
analyze the trade-off between defense success rate improvement and
computational overhead. This self-consciousness method offers a lightweight,
cost-effective solution for enhancing LLM ethics, particularly beneficial for
GenAI use cases across various platforms.

Result: 代码减少60-80%，性能提升3.1倍，兼容现有函数调用标准。

Conclusion: 为工具集成架构提供理论见解和实际解决方案，推动大语言模型应用开发。

Abstract: The proliferation of tool-augmented Large Language Models (LLMs) has created
a fragmented ecosystem where developers must navigate multiple protocols,
manual schema definitions, and complex execution workflows. We address this
challenge by proposing a unified approach to tool integration that abstracts
protocol differences while optimizing execution performance. Our solution
demonstrates how protocol-agnostic design principles can significantly reduce
development overhead through automated schema generation, dual-mode concurrent
execution, and seamless multi-source tool management. Experimental results show
60-80% code reduction across integration scenarios, performance improvements up
to 3.1x through optimized concurrency, and full compatibility with existing
function calling standards. This work contributes both theoretical insights
into tool integration architecture and practical solutions for real-world LLM
application development.

Conclusion: 基于代理的评估可以补充人类监督，为下一代LLMs的可信、可扩展评估迈出一步。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) grow in capability and autonomy, evaluating
their outputs-especially in open-ended and complex tasks-has become a critical
bottleneck. A new paradigm is emerging: using AI agents as the evaluators
themselves. This "agent-as-a-judge" approach leverages the reasoning and
perspective-taking abilities of LLMs to assess the quality and safety of other
models, promising calable and nuanced alternatives to human evaluation. In this
review, we define the agent-as-a-judge concept, trace its evolution from
single-model judges to dynamic multi-agent debate frameworks, and critically
examine their strengths and shortcomings. We compare these approaches across
reliability, cost, and human alignment, and survey real-world deployments in
domains such as medicine, law, finance, and education. Finally, we highlight
pressing challenges-including bias, robustness, and meta evaluation-and outline
future research directions. By bringing together these strands, our review
demonstrates how agent-based judging can complement (but not replace) human
oversight, marking a step toward trustworthy, scalable evaluation for
next-generation LLMs.

Result: 在ALFWorld、ScienceWorld和WebShop上实现最优性能，且显著提升令牌效率。

Conclusion: BPO为代理规划中的推理模型提供了一种新方法，适用于长时程稀疏奖励环境。

Abstract: Large Language Reasoning Models have demonstrated remarkable success on
static tasks, yet their application to multi-round agentic planning in
interactive environments faces two fundamental challenges. First, the
intractable credit assignment problem renders conventional reinforcement
learning ineffective in sparse-reward settings. Second, the computational
overhead of verbose, step-by-step reasoning histories is prohibitive. To
address these challenges, we propose BPO, a three-stage framework
(bootstrapping, extrapolation, and refinement) that establishes a
self-improving data flywheel to develop robust reasoning models for
long-horizon, sparse-reward environments. Our framework first bootstraps
efficient reasoning using the proposed planning quaternions with long-short
chain-of-thought fusion. It then extrapolates to out-of-distribution tasks
through complexity-stratified curriculum learning. Finally, the model
iteratively refines itself by learning exclusively on experiences selected via
reward-gated rejection sampling. Experiments on ALFWorld, ScienceWorld, and
WebShop demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art with
significant token efficiency, providing a new recipe for reasoning models in
agentic planning.

Motivation: 现有基于学习的MILP方法独立处理各模块的策略学习，忽视了模块间的相互依赖，影响了求解效率和质量。

Method: 将MILP求解中的割平面选择和分支协作建模为Stackelberg博弈，采用两阶段学习范式（数据通信预训练和模块策略协调学习）稳定协作策略学习。

Result: 在合成和大规模真实MILP数据集上，联合学习的策略显著提升了求解性能，并展现出优秀的跨实例集泛化能力。

Conclusion: Collab-Solver通过协作优化多模块策略，解决了现有方法的局限性，为MILP求解提供了高效且泛化性强的解决方案。

Abstract: Mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) has been a fundamental problem in
combinatorial optimization. Previous works have designed a plethora of
hard-coded heuristics to accomplish challenging MILP solving with domain
knowledge. Driven by the high capability of neural networks, recent research is
devoted to replacing manually designed heuristics with learned policies.
Although learning-based MILP methods have shown great promise, existing
worksindependentlytreatthepolicylearningineachmoduleofMILPsolvers without
considering their interdependence, severely hurting the solving speed and
quality. To address this issue, we propose a novel multi-agent-based policy
learning framework for MILP (Collab-Solver), which can collaboratively optimize
the policies for multiple modules. Specifically, we formulate the collaboration
of cut selection and branching in MILP solving as a Stackelberg game. Under
this formulation, we develop a two-phase learning paradigm to stabilize the
collaborative policy learning, where the first phase achieves the
data-communicated policy pretraining and the second phase further orchestrates
the policy learning for various modules. The jointly learned policy
significantly improves the solving performance on both synthetic and
large-scale real-world MILP datasets. Moreover, the policies learned by
Collab-Solver have also demonstrated excellent generalization abilities across
different instance sets.

Result: GPT-2能有效学习元ODE算法，性能优于欧拉方法，且随着示例增加精度呈指数提升，还能泛化到分布外问题。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了ICL在NLP中的机制及其解决非线性数值问题的潜力。

Abstract: In-Context Learning (ICL) has emerged as a new paradigm in large language
models (LLMs), enabling them to perform novel tasks by conditioning on a few
examples embedded in the prompt. Yet, the highly nonlinear behavior of ICL for
NLP tasks remains poorly understood. To shed light on its underlying
mechanisms, this paper investigates whether LLMs can solve ordinary
differential equations (ODEs) under the ICL setting. We formulate standard ODE
problems and their solutions as sequential prompts and evaluate GPT-2 models on
these tasks. Experiments on two types of ODEs show that GPT-2 can effectively
learn a meta-ODE algorithm, with convergence behavior comparable to, or better
than, the Euler method, and achieve exponential accuracy gains with increasing
numbers of demonstrations. Moreover, the model generalizes to
out-of-distribution (OOD) problems, demonstrating robust extrapolation
capabilities. These empirical findings provide new insights into the mechanisms
of ICL in NLP and its potential for solving nonlinear numerical problems.

Result: 在真实医学数据上的实验表明，ToR框架优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: ToR框架通过增强推理能力和一致性验证，显著提升了复杂医学场景下的诊断性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown great potential in the medical
domain. However, existing models still fall short when faced with complex
medical diagnosis task in the real world. This is mainly because they lack
sufficient reasoning depth, which leads to information loss or logical jumps
when processing a large amount of specialized medical data, leading to
diagnostic errors. To address these challenges, we propose Tree-of-Reasoning
(ToR), a novel multi-agent framework designed to handle complex scenarios.
Specifically, ToR introduces a tree structure that can clearly record the
reasoning path of LLMs and the corresponding clinical evidence. At the same
time, we propose a cross-validation mechanism to ensure the consistency of
multi-agent decision-making, thereby improving the clinical reasoning ability
of multi-agents in complex medical scenarios. Experimental results on
real-world medical data show that our framework can achieve better performance
than existing baseline methods.

Result: 实验表明，CDD在防御性能和泛化能力上达到最优水平。

Conclusion: CDD框架为防御越狱攻击提供了一种有效且通用的解决方案。

Abstract: Defending large language models (LLMs) against jailbreak attacks is essential
for their safe and reliable deployment. Existing defenses often rely on shallow
pattern matching, which struggles to generalize to novel and unseen attack
strategies. To address this challenge, we propose the Cognitive-Driven Defense
(CDD) framework, which targets the underlying structure of jailbreak prompts by
applying meta-operations, defined as basic manipulations that conceal harmful
intent.CDD emulates human cognitive reasoning through a structured reasoning
chain. It begins with a global perception of the prompt and follows with a
localized analysis to uncover hidden manipulations. By applying supervised
fine-tuning on this structured chain, the model learns to identify and reason
about known manipulation patterns. To enhance generalization to unseen threats,
an entropy-guided reinforcement learning algorithm (EG-GRPO) is introduced to
encourage exploration of new types and variants of meta-operations. Experiments
demonstrate that CDD can achieve state-of-the-art defense performance and
exhibit strong generalization to unseen jailbreak attacks.

Conclusion: 开源模型需针对性优化以匹配专有模型，ContractEval为法律领域LLM发展提供基准。

Abstract: The potential of large language models (LLMs) in specialized domains such as
legal risk analysis remains underexplored. In response to growing interest in
locally deploying open-source LLMs for legal tasks while preserving data
confidentiality, this paper introduces ContractEval, the first benchmark to
thoroughly evaluate whether open-source LLMs could match proprietary LLMs in
identifying clause-level legal risks in commercial contracts. Using the
Contract Understanding Atticus Dataset (CUAD), we assess 4 proprietary and 15
open-source LLMs. Our results highlight five key findings: (1) Proprietary
models outperform open-source models in both correctness and output
effectiveness, though some open-source models are competitive in certain
specific dimensions. (2) Larger open-source models generally perform better,
though the improvement slows down as models get bigger. (3) Reasoning
("thinking") mode improves output effectiveness but reduces correctness, likely
due to over-complicating simpler tasks. (4) Open-source models generate "no
related clause" responses more frequently even when relevant clauses are
present. This suggests "laziness" in thinking or low confidence in extracting
relevant content. (5) Model quantization speeds up inference but at the cost of
performance drop, showing the tradeoff between efficiency and accuracy. These
findings suggest that while most LLMs perform at a level comparable to junior
legal assistants, open-source models require targeted fine-tuning to ensure
correctness and effectiveness in high-stakes legal settings. ContractEval
offers a solid benchmark to guide future development of legal-domain LLMs.

Motivation: 现有自动化启发式设计（AHD）方法仅生成单一启发式，导致对不同问题实例的泛化能力不足，因此需要一种能生成互补启发式集合的新方法。

Method: 提出AHSD框架，目标函数为单调超模，并设计了EoH-S算法，通过互补种群管理和互补感知的模因搜索生成高质量互补启发式集合。

Result: 在三个AHD任务上的实验表明，EoH-S性能显著优于现有方法，最高提升60%。

Conclusion: AHSD和EoH-S为LLM驱动的AHD提供了更高效的解决方案，显著提升了泛化能力和性能。

Abstract: Automated Heuristic Design (AHD) using Large Language Models (LLMs) has
achieved notable success in recent years. Despite the effectiveness of existing
approaches, they only design a single heuristic to serve all problem instances,
often inducing poor generalization across different distributions or settings.
To address this issue, we propose Automated Heuristic Set Design (AHSD), a new
formulation for LLM-driven AHD. The aim of AHSD is to automatically generate a
small-sized complementary heuristic set to serve diverse problem instances,
such that each problem instance could be optimized by at least one heuristic in
this set. We show that the objective function of AHSD is monotone and
supermodular. Then, we propose Evolution of Heuristic Set (EoH-S) to apply the
AHSD formulation for LLM-driven AHD. With two novel mechanisms of complementary
population management and complementary-aware memetic search, EoH-S could
effectively generate a set of high-quality and complementary heuristics.
Comprehensive experimental results on three AHD tasks with diverse instances
spanning various sizes and distributions demonstrate that EoH-S consistently
outperforms existing state-of-the-art AHD methods and achieves up to 60\%
performance improvements.

Result: MissDDIM通过确定性采样减少了输出可变性，同时保持了填补的多样性。

Conclusion: MissDDIM为表格数据填补提供了一种高效且稳定的解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion models have recently emerged as powerful tools for missing data
imputation by modeling the joint distribution of observed and unobserved
variables. However, existing methods, typically based on stochastic denoising
diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs), suffer from high inference latency and
variable outputs, limiting their applicability in real-world tabular settings.
To address these deficiencies, we present in this paper MissDDIM, a conditional
diffusion framework that adapts Denoising Diffusion Implicit Models (DDIM) for
tabular imputation. While stochastic sampling enables diverse completions, it
also introduces output variability that complicates downstream processing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有生成UEs的方法需要联合优化图像和文本噪声，计算成本高且依赖第三方服务，导致隐私泄露。

Method: T2UE利用文本到图像模型将文本描述映射到图像（噪声）空间，结合误差最小化框架生成有效的不可学习噪声。

Result: 实验表明，T2UE保护的数据显著降低了最先进模型在下游任务（如跨模态检索）中的性能，且保护效果泛化到多种架构和监督学习场景。

Conclusion: T2UE实现了“零接触数据保护”，仅通过文本描述即可保护数据，无需直接暴露原始数据。

Abstract: Large-scale pre-training frameworks like CLIP have revolutionized multimodal
learning, but their reliance on web-scraped datasets, frequently containing
private user data, raises serious concerns about misuse. Unlearnable Examples
(UEs) have emerged as a promising countermeasure against unauthorized model
training, employing carefully crafted unlearnable noise to disrupt the learning
of meaningful representations from protected data. Current approaches typically
generate UEs by jointly optimizing unlearnable noise for both images and their
associated text descriptions (or labels). However, this optimization process is
often computationally prohibitive for on-device execution, forcing reliance on
external third-party services. This creates a fundamental privacy paradox:
users must initially expose their data to these very services to achieve
protection, thereby compromising privacy in the process. Such a contradiction
has severely hindered the development of practical, scalable data protection
solutions. To resolve this paradox, we introduce \textbf{Text-to-Unlearnable
Example (T2UE)}, a novel framework that enables users to generate UEs using
only text descriptions. T2UE circumvents the need for original image data by
employing a text-to-image (T2I) model to map text descriptions into the image
(noise) space, combined with an error-minimization framework to produce
effective unlearnable noise. Extensive experiments show that T2UE-protected
data substantially degrades performance in downstream tasks (e.g., cross-modal
retrieval) for state-of-the-art models. Notably, the protective effect
generalizes across diverse architectures and even to supervised learning
settings. Our work demonstrates the feasibility of "zero-contact data
protection", where personal data can be safeguarded based solely on their
textual descriptions, eliminating the need for direct data exposure.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型语言模型（LLM）的普及，虚假信息检测变得更为重要和复杂，传统二元判断方法已无法满足需求。

Method: 设计了一种LLM代理，包含精确网络搜索工具、来源可信度评估工具和数值声明验证工具，支持多步验证策略和证据记录。

Abstract: With the proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs), the detection of
misinformation has become increasingly important and complex. This research
proposes an innovative verifiable misinformation detection LLM agent that goes
beyond traditional true/false binary judgments. The agent actively verifies
claims through dynamic interaction with diverse web sources, assesses
information source credibility, synthesizes evidence, and provides a complete
verifiable reasoning process. Our designed agent architecture includes three
core tools: precise web search tool, source credibility assessment tool and
numerical claim verification tool. These tools enable the agent to execute
multi-step verification strategies, maintain evidence logs, and form
comprehensive assessment conclusions. We evaluate using standard misinformation
datasets such as FakeNewsNet, comparing with traditional machine learning
models and LLMs. Evaluation metrics include standard classification metrics,
quality assessment of reasoning processes, and robustness testing against
rewritten content. Experimental results show that our agent outperforms
baseline methods in misinformation detection accuracy, reasoning transparency,
and resistance to information rewriting, providing a new paradigm for
trustworthy AI-assisted fact-checking.

TL;DR: 论文提出AgentSME框架，利用LLM为智能教育定制生成式代理模型，通过三种通信模式（Solo、Mono、Echo）验证其效果，结果显示Echo模式准确率最高，DeepSeek多样性最佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 智能教育中生成式代理模型发展不足，教育场景复杂且需个性化沟通，需解决此问题。

Method: 提出AgentSME框架，采用三种通信模式（Solo、Mono、Echo），以准确率和多样性指标评估六种LLM。

Result: Echo模式准确率最高，DeepSeek多样性最佳。

Conclusion: 研究为提升代理学习能力和智能教育模型提供了有价值的信息。

Abstract: Generative agent models specifically tailored for smart education are
critical, yet remain relatively underdeveloped. A key challenge stems from the
inherent complexity of educational contexts: learners are human beings with
various cognitive behaviors, and pedagogy is fundamentally centered on
personalized human-to-human communication. To address this issue, this paper
proposes AgentSME, a unified generative agent framework powered by LLM. Three
directional communication modes are considered in the models, namely Solo,
Mono, and Echo, reflecting different types of agency autonomy and communicative
reciprocity. Accuracy is adopted as the primary evaluation metric, complemented
by three diversity indices designed to assess the diversity of reasoning
contents. Six widely used LLMs are tested to validate the robustness of
communication modes across different model tiers, which are equally divided
into base-capacity and high-capacity configurations. The results show that
generative agents that employ the Echo communication mode achieve the highest
accuracy scores, while DeepSeek exhibits the greatest diversity. This study
provides valuable information to improve agent learning capabilities and
inspire smart education models.

Abstract: We present a framework for training trustworthy large language model (LLM)
agents for optimization modeling via a verifiable synthetic data generation
pipeline. Focusing on linear and mixed-integer linear programming, our approach
begins with structured symbolic representations and systematically produces
natural language descriptions, mathematical formulations, and solver-executable
code. By programmatically constructing each instance with known optimal
solutions, the pipeline ensures full verifiability and enables automatic
filtering of low-quality demonstrations generated by teacher models. Each
dataset instance includes a structured representation of the optimization
problem, a corresponding natural language description, the verified optimal
solution, and step-by-step demonstrations - generated by a teacher model - that
show how to model and solve the problem across multiple optimization modeling
languages. This enables supervised fine-tuning of open-source LLMs specifically
tailored to optimization tasks. To operationalize this pipeline, we introduce
OptiTrust, a modular LLM agent that performs multi-stage translation from
natural language to solver-ready code, leveraging stepwise demonstrations,
multi-language inference, and majority-vote cross-validation. Our agent
achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard benchmarks. Out of 7
datasets, it achieves the highest accuracy on six and outperforms the next-best
algorithm by at least 8 percentage on three of them. Our approach provides a
scalable, verifiable, and principled path toward building reliable LLM agents
for real-world optimization applications.

Conclusion: AI可作为环境教育的辅助工具，但人类专家的参与仍不可或缺。

Abstract: This research investigates the potential of Artificial Intelligence (AI)
models to bridge the knowledge gap in environmental education among university
students. By focusing on prominent large language models (LLMs) such as
GPT-3.5, GPT-4, GPT-4o, Gemini, Claude Sonnet, and Llama 2, the study assesses
their effectiveness in conveying environmental concepts and, consequently,
facilitating environmental education. The investigation employs a standardized
tool, the Environmental Knowledge Test (EKT-19), supplemented by targeted
questions, to evaluate the environmental knowledge of university students in
comparison to the responses generated by the AI models. The results of this
study suggest that while AI models possess a vast, readily accessible, and
valid knowledge base with the potential to empower both students and academic
staff, a human discipline specialist in environmental sciences may still be
necessary to validate the accuracy of the information provided.

Abstract: We present the $Y_0$ Python package, which implements causal identification
algorithms that apply interventional, counterfactual, and transportability
queries to data from (randomized) controlled trials, observational studies, or
mixtures thereof. $Y_0$ focuses on the qualitative investigation of causation,
helping researchers determine whether a causal relationship can be estimated
from available data before attempting to estimate how strong that relationship
is. Furthermore, $Y_0$ provides guidance on how to transform the causal query
into a symbolic estimand that can be non-parametrically estimated from the
available data. $Y_0$ provides a domain-specific language for representing
causal queries and estimands as symbolic probabilistic expressions, tools for
representing causal graphical models with unobserved confounders, such as
acyclic directed mixed graphs (ADMGs), and implementations of numerous
identification algorithms from the recent causal inference literature. The

Result: 实验表明，Geoint-R1在需要显式辅助元素构建的挑战性问题上显著优于现有模型。

Conclusion: Geoint-R1为形式化几何推理提供了有效解决方案，并通过基准数据集推动了该领域的发展。

Abstract: Mathematical geometric reasoning is essential for scientific discovery and
educational development, requiring precise logic and rigorous formal
verification. While recent advances in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs)
have improved reasoning tasks, existing models typically struggle with formal
geometric reasoning, particularly when dynamically constructing and verifying
auxiliary geometric elements. To address these challenges, we introduce
Geoint-R1, a multimodal reasoning framework designed to generate formally
verifiable geometric solutions from textual descriptions and visual diagrams.
Geoint-R1 uniquely integrates auxiliary elements construction, formal reasoning
represented via Lean4, and interactive visualization. To systematically
evaluate and advance formal geometric reasoning, we propose the Geoint
benchmark, comprising 1,885 rigorously annotated geometry problems across
diverse topics such as plane, spatial, and solid geometry. Each problem
includes structured textual annotations, precise Lean4 code for auxiliary
constructions, and detailed solution steps verified by experts. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that Geoint-R1 significantly surpasses existing
multimodal and math-specific reasoning models, particularly on challenging
problems requiring explicit auxiliary element constructions.

encountering difficulties in knowledge expansion and inadequate flexibility.
This paper proposes an LLM-empowered agent model for simulating and selecting

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种全历史图模型和ETDNet网络，用于建模实体间动态交互，显著提升了交通预测和金融欺诈检测的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 许多任务需要建模实体间动态交互，传统方法无法明确捕捉关系和其演化过程。

Method: 引入全历史图，区分时间步内和时间步间边，设计ETDNet网络并行处理两种边信息。

Result: 在Waymo和Elliptic++数据集上，ETDNet显著优于基线模型，准确率和F1分数均有提升。

Conclusion: 将结构和时间关系作为图中的独立边表示，能有效提升动态交互建模的性能。

Abstract: Modeling evolving interactions among entities is critical in many real-world
tasks. For example, predicting driver maneuvers in traffic requires tracking
how neighboring vehicles accelerate, brake, and change lanes relative to one
another over consecutive frames. Likewise, detecting financial fraud hinges on
following the flow of funds through successive transactions as they propagate
through the network. Unlike classic time-series forecasting, these settings
demand reasoning over who interacts with whom and when, calling for a
temporal-graph representation that makes both the relations and their evolution
explicit. Existing temporal-graph methods typically use snapshot graphs to
encode temporal evolution. We introduce a full-history graph that instantiates
one node for every entity at every time step and separates two edge sets: (i)
intra-time-step edges that capture relations within a single frame and (ii)
inter-time-step edges that connect an entity to itself at consecutive steps. To
learn on this graph we design an Edge-Type Decoupled Network (ETDNet) with
parallel modules: a graph-attention module aggregates information along
intra-time-step edges, a multi-head temporal-attention module attends over an
entity's inter-time-step history, and a fusion module combines the two messages
after every layer. Evaluated on driver-intention prediction (Waymo) and Bitcoin
fraud detection (Elliptic++), ETDNet consistently surpasses strong baselines,
lifting Waymo joint accuracy to 75.6\% (vs. 74.1\%) and raising Elliptic++
illicit-class F1 to 88.1\% (vs. 60.4\%). These gains demonstrate the benefit of
representing structural and temporal relations as distinct edges in a single
graph.

Motivation: 现有研究在工具增强的视觉问答中表现良好，但在真实世界多模态环境中的多步推理能力仍有不足。

Method: 提出ToolVQA数据集和ToolEngine数据生成管道，采用DFS和动态上下文示例匹配机制模拟人类工具使用推理。

Result: 7B LFMs在ToolVQA上表现优异，并在OOD数据集上超越GPT-3.5-turbo。

Conclusion: ToolVQA填补了真实世界工具使用能力的空白，展示了模型的强泛化能力。

Abstract: Integrating external tools into Large Foundation Models (LFMs) has emerged as
a promising approach to enhance their problem-solving capabilities. While
existing studies have demonstrated strong performance in tool-augmented Visual
Question Answering (VQA), recent benchmarks reveal significant gaps in
real-world tool-use proficiency, particularly in functionally diverse
multimodal settings requiring multi-step reasoning. In this work, we introduce
ToolVQA, a large-scale multimodal dataset comprising 23K instances, designed to
bridge this gap. Unlike previous datasets that rely on synthetic scenarios and
simplified queries, ToolVQA features real-world visual contexts and challenging
implicit multi-step reasoning tasks, better aligning with real user
interactions. To construct this dataset, we propose ToolEngine, a novel data
generation pipeline that employs Depth-First Search (DFS) with a dynamic
in-context example matching mechanism to simulate human-like tool-use
reasoning. ToolVQA encompasses 10 multimodal tools across 7 diverse task
domains, with an average inference length of 2.78 reasoning steps per instance.
The fine-tuned 7B LFMs on ToolVQA not only achieve impressive performance on
our test set but also surpass the large close-sourced model GPT-3.5-turbo on
various out-of-distribution (OOD) datasets, demonstrating strong
generalizability to real-world tool-use scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有记忆系统依赖任意粒度的基本记忆单元和被动规则机制，限制了其学习和进化能力，Nemori旨在解决这些问题。

Method: Nemori采用两步对齐原则（基于事件分割理论）和预测校准原则（基于自由能原理），实现语义连贯记忆组织和自适应知识进化。

Result: 在LoCoMo和LongMemEval基准测试中，Nemori显著优于现有系统，尤其在长上下文场景中表现突出。

Conclusion: Nemori为自主代理的长期动态工作流提供了可行的解决方案，展示了其在长上下文记忆管理中的优越性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable capabilities, yet their
inability to maintain persistent memory in long contexts limits their
effectiveness as autonomous agents in long-term interactions. While existing
memory systems have made progress, their reliance on arbitrary granularity for
defining the basic memory unit and passive, rule-based mechanisms for knowledge
extraction limits their capacity for genuine learning and evolution. To address
these foundational limitations, we present Nemori, a novel self-organizing
memory architecture inspired by human cognitive principles. Nemori's core
innovation is twofold: First, its Two-Step Alignment Principle, inspired by
Event Segmentation Theory, provides a principled, top-down method for
autonomously organizing the raw conversational stream into semantically
coherent episodes, solving the critical issue of memory granularity. Second,
its Predict-Calibrate Principle, inspired by the Free-energy Principle, enables
the agent to proactively learn from prediction gaps, moving beyond pre-defined
heuristics to achieve adaptive knowledge evolution. This offers a viable path
toward handling the long-term, dynamic workflows of autonomous agents.
Extensive experiments on the LoCoMo and LongMemEval benchmarks demonstrate that
Nemori significantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art systems, with its
advantage being particularly pronounced in longer contexts.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM（如ChatGPT和Claude）的兴起，需要能够实时处理任务的AI代理。然而，将数据密集型、多模态的边缘工作负载迁移到云端数据中心会引入显著延迟，而边缘部署又面临资源有限和异构的挑战。

Method: 提出了一种自适应框架，用于AI代理在边缘智能系统中的放置和迁移。该方法建模资源约束和延迟/成本，利用蚁群算法和基于LLM的优化进行高效决策。

Result: 在分布式系统中实现并验证，显著降低了部署延迟和迁移成本。

Conclusion: 该方案为动态边缘环境中LLM-based AI代理的高效部署和管理提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The rise of LLMs such as ChatGPT and Claude fuels the need for AI agents
capable of real-time task handling. However, migrating data-intensive,
multi-modal edge workloads to cloud data centers, traditionally used for agent
deployment, introduces significant latency. Deploying AI agents at the edge
improves efficiency and reduces latency. However, edge environments present
challenges due to limited and heterogeneous resources. Maintaining QoS for
mobile users necessitates agent migration, which is complicated by the
complexity of AI agents coordinating LLMs, task planning, memory, and external
tools. This paper presents the first systematic deployment and management
solution for LLM-based AI agents in dynamic edge environments. We propose a
novel adaptive framework for AI agent placement and migration in edge
intelligence systems. Our approach models resource constraints and
latency/cost, leveraging ant colony algorithms and LLM-based optimization for
efficient decision-making. It autonomously places agents to optimize resource
utilization and QoS and enables lightweight agent migration by transferring
only essential state. Implemented on a distributed system using AgentScope and
validated across globally distributed edge servers, our solution significantly
reduces deployment latency and migration costs.

Motivation: LLMs在复杂推理中生成冗余的思维链（CoT），导致推理成本高、效率低。

Method: 引入步骤熵量化信息贡献，识别冗余步骤；提出两阶段训练策略（SFT+GRPO）结合[SKIP]标记实现自主压缩。

Result: 实验证明80%低熵步骤可剪枝且准确性几乎无损，随机或高熵剪枝则严重损害性能。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升LLM推理效率并保持准确性，对实际部署和推理结构理解有重要意义。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) using Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting excel at
complex reasoning but generate verbose thought processes with considerable
redundancy, leading to increased inference costs and reduced efficiency. We
introduce a novel CoT compression framework based on step entropy, a metric
that quantifies the informational contribution of individual reasoning steps to
identify redundancy. Through theoretical analysis and extensive empirical
validation on mathematical reasoning benchmarks, we demonstrate that steps with
low entropy are indeed highly redundant. Our experiments reveal that an
astonishing 80\% of low-entropy intermediate steps can be pruned with minor
degradation in the final answer accuracy across DeepSeek-R1-7B, 14B and
Qwen3-8B. This finding sharply contrasts with random or high-entropy pruning,
which severely impairs reasoning performance. Building on this, we propose a
novel two-stage training strategy combining Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and
Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) reinforcement learning. This approach
enables LLMs to autonomously learn to generate compressed COTs during inference
by strategically incorporating [SKIP] tokens. Our method significantly enhances
LLM inference efficiency while rigorously preserving accuracy, offering
profound implications for practical LLM deployment and a deeper understanding
of reasoning structures.

Conclusion: 研究为构建临床实用且语言鲁棒的语音认知评估工具提供了重要进展。

Abstract: Automatic assessment of cognitive impairment from spontaneous speech offers a
promising, non-invasive avenue for early cognitive screening. However, current
approaches often lack generalizability when deployed across different languages
and clinical settings, limiting their practical utility. In this study, we
propose CogBench, the first benchmark designed to evaluate the cross-lingual
and cross-site generalizability of large language models (LLMs) for
speech-based cognitive impairment assessment. Using a unified multimodal
pipeline, we evaluate model performance on three speech datasets spanning
English and Mandarin: ADReSSo, NCMMSC2021-AD, and a newly collected test set,
CIR-E. Our results show that conventional deep learning models degrade
substantially when transferred across domains. In contrast, LLMs equipped with
chain-of-thought prompting demonstrate better adaptability, though their
performance remains sensitive to prompt design. Furthermore, we explore
lightweight fine-tuning of LLMs via Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), which
significantly improves generalization in target domains. These findings offer a
critical step toward building clinically useful and linguistically robust
speech-based cognitive assessment tools.

Result: 混合方法在通用逻辑推理中表现更优，因其可解释性强且保留LLM优势。

Conclusion: 提出基于混合方法的通用框架，支持未来研究。

Abstract: General logical reasoning, defined as the ability to reason deductively on
domain-agnostic tasks, continues to be a challenge for large language models
(LLMs). Current LLMs fail to reason deterministically and are not
interpretable. As such, there has been a recent surge in interest in
neurosymbolic AI, which attempts to incorporate logic into neural networks. We
first identify two main neurosymbolic approaches to improving logical
reasoning: (i) the integrative approach comprising models where symbolic
reasoning is contained within the neural network, and (ii) the hybrid approach
comprising models where a symbolic solver, separate from the neural network,
performs symbolic reasoning. Both contain AI systems with promising results on
domain-specific logical reasoning benchmarks. However, their performance on
domain-agnostic benchmarks is understudied. To the best of our knowledge, there
has not been a comparison of the contrasting approaches that answers the
following question: Which approach is more promising for developing general
logical reasoning? To analyze their potential, the following best-in-class
domain-agnostic models are introduced: Logic Neural Network (LNN), which uses
the integrative approach, and LLM-Symbolic Solver (LLM-SS), which uses the
hybrid approach. Using both models as case studies and representatives of each
approach, our analysis demonstrates that the hybrid approach is more promising
for developing general logical reasoning because (i) its reasoning chain is
more interpretable, and (ii) it retains the capabilities and advantages of
existing LLMs. To support future works using the hybrid approach, we propose a
generalizable framework based on LLM-SS that is modular by design,
model-agnostic, domain-agnostic, and requires little to no human input.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为UML2Dep的逐步代码生成框架，通过利用形式化规范解决自然语言描述的模糊性，提升代码生成的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自然语言描述在代码生成中存在模糊性，难以捕捉复杂需求和隐式数据依赖，因此需要更明确的形式化规范。

Method: 1. 引入增强版UML序列图，结合决策表和API规范；2. 提出数据依赖推断任务（DDI），构建显式数据依赖图；3. 使用约束数学推理和静态解析优化推理效率。

Result: 框架通过形式化规范和DDI任务，显著减少了模糊性，提升了代码生成的准确性和效率。

Conclusion: UML2Dep框架通过形式化规范和数学推理，有效解决了自然语言描述的模糊性，为复杂系统代码生成提供了可靠方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at generating code from natural language
(NL) descriptions. However, the plain textual descriptions are inherently
ambiguous and often fail to capture complex requirements like intricate system
behaviors, conditional logic, and architectural constraints; implicit data
dependencies in service-oriented architectures are difficult to infer and
handle correctly. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel step-by-step code
generation framework named UML2Dep by leveraging unambiguous formal
specifications of complex requirements. First, we introduce an enhanced Unified
Modeling Language (UML) sequence diagram tailored for service-oriented
architectures. This diagram extends traditional visual syntax by integrating
decision tables and API specifications, explicitly formalizing structural
relationships and business logic flows in service interactions to rigorously
eliminate linguistic ambiguity. Second, recognizing the critical role of data
flow, we introduce a dedicated data dependency inference (DDI) task. DDI
systematically constructs an explicit data dependency graph prior to actual
code synthesis. To ensure reliability, we formalize DDI as a constrained
mathematical reasoning task through novel prompting strategies, aligning with
LLMs' excellent mathematical strengths. Additional static parsing and
dependency pruning further reduce context complexity and cognitive load
associated with intricate specifications, thereby enhancing reasoning accuracy
and efficiency.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种动态对抗框架HSG，通过生成和诊断复杂错误来提升大语言模型的诊断能力，实验表明其效果优于GPT-4o等基线模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在复杂错误的识别和诊断上表现不佳，主要因为训练目标过于关注正确答案，缺乏对错误的学习。

Method: 提出HSG框架，包含两个对抗角色：Sneaky生成隐蔽错误，Diagnosis负责检测错误，通过对抗协同进化提升能力。

Result: 在数学推理任务中，HSG的诊断准确率比基线模型（如GPT-4o）高出16.8%至31.4%。

Conclusion: HSG显著提升了错误诊断能力，并发布了一个具有挑战性的数据集，为未来研究提供基准。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in reasoning and generation across
domains, but still struggle with identifying and diagnosing complex errors.
This stems mainly from training objectives that prioritize correct answers,
limiting exposure to and learning from errors. While recent studies have begun
to address this by introducing error signals, most rely on shallow, static
errors, restricting improvement in deep diagnostic ability. To overcome this,
we propose Hide and Seek Game (HSG), a dynamic adversarial framework for error
generation and diagnosis, and evaluate it on mathematical problem-solving. HSG
involves two adversarial roles: Sneaky, which "hides" by generating subtle,
deceptive reasoning errors, and Diagnosis, which "seeks" to accurately detect
them. Through adversarial co-evolution, both error stealth and diagnostic
precision are enhanced. Experiments on several math reasoning tasks show that
HSG significantly boosts error diagnosis, achieving 16.8\%--31.4\% higher
accuracy than baselines like GPT-4o. We also release a challenging dataset of
deceptive errors and diagnostic annotations as a benchmark for future research.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种多目标不可行性诊断方法（MOID），结合LLM代理和多目标优化，为不可行路由问题提供多种可行的调整建议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实中的路由问题常因用户提出的冲突或不合理需求导致模型不可行，现有LLM方法未能全面考虑多种调整可能性。

Method: MOID结合多目标优化（考虑路径成本和约束违反）和LLM代理，生成一组权衡解，并通过LLM分析这些解以提供诊断建议。

Result: 在50类不可行路由问题上，MOID能单次运行生成多种诊断建议，比现有方法更具实用性。

Conclusion: MOID通过多目标优化和LLM代理的结合，有效解决了不可行路由问题的诊断和调整建议生成问题。

Abstract: In real-world routing problems, users often propose conflicting or
unreasonable requirements, which result in infeasible optimization models due
to overly restrictive or contradictory constraints, leading to an empty
feasible solution set. Existing Large Language Model (LLM)-based methods
attempt to diagnose infeasible models, but modifying such models often involves
multiple potential adjustments that these methods do not consider. To fill this
gap, we introduce Multi-Objective Infeasibility Diagnosis (MOID), which
combines LLM agents and multi-objective optimization within an automatic
routing solver, to provide a set of representative actionable suggestions.
Specifically, MOID employs multi-objective optimization to consider both path
cost and constraint violation, generating a set of trade-off solutions, each
encompassing varying degrees of model adjustments. To extract practical
insights from these solutions, MOID utilizes LLM agents to generate a solution
analysis function for the infeasible model. This function analyzes these
distinct solutions to diagnose the original infeasible model, providing users
with diverse diagnostic insights and suggestions. Finally, we compare MOID with
several LLM-based methods on 50 types of infeasible routing problems. The
results indicate that MOID automatically generates multiple diagnostic
suggestions in a single run, providing more practical insights for restoring
model feasibility and decision-making compared to existing methods.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于大型语言模型（LLM）的信息提取和知识图谱（KG）生成方法，用于连接生物医学知识，并通过上下文增强提取准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 公开医学数据的快速增长导致临床医生和研究人员难以系统性地理解和应用最新知识，亟需自动化工具来整合和更新知识。

Method: 通过LLM代理分解PubMed摘要为语义命题句子，提取KG三元组，并结合开放领域和基于本体的方法增强三元组为四元组。

Result: 提取的三元组生成的自然语言句子与原命题的平均余弦相似度为0.874，上下文变量显著提升了相似度。

Conclusion: 该方法为医学从业者提供了实时更新的集中知识源，并可能在其他领域实现类似效果。

Abstract: The rapid expansion of publicly-available medical data presents a challenge
for clinicians and researchers alike, increasing the gap between the volume of
scientific literature and its applications. The steady growth of studies and
findings overwhelms medical professionals at large, hindering their ability to
systematically review and understand the latest knowledge. This paper presents
an approach to information extraction and automatic knowledge graph (KG)
generation to identify and connect biomedical knowledge. Through a pipeline of
large language model (LLM) agents, the system decomposes 44 PubMed abstracts
into semantically meaningful proposition sentences and extracts KG triples from
these sentences. The triples are enhanced using a combination of open domain
and ontology-based information extraction methodologies to incorporate
ontological categories. On top of this, a context variable is included during
extraction to allow the triple to stand on its own - thereby becoming
`quadruples'. The extraction accuracy of the LLM is validated by comparing
natural language sentences generated from the enhanced triples to the original
propositions, achieving an average cosine similarity of 0.874. The similarity
for generated sentences of enhanced triples were compared with generated
sentences of ordinary triples showing an increase as a result of the context
variable. Furthermore, this research explores the ability for LLMs to infer new
relationships and connect clusters in the knowledge base of the knowledge
graph. This approach leads the way to provide medical practitioners with a
centralised, updated in real-time, and sustainable knowledge source, and may be
the foundation of similar gains in a wide variety of fields.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种将信念系统建模为有向加权图的最小形式主义，区分了信念结构和信念强度，提供了比传统方法更丰富的认知状态分类。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统信念系统表示方法（如概率分布或逻辑框架）忽略了内部结构，混淆了外部可信度和内部一致性，无法建模碎片化或矛盾的认知状态。

Method: 使用有向加权图表示信念系统，节点为信念，边为认知关系（支持或矛盾），并分别用可信度和置信度量化信念的外部来源和内部支持。

Result: 该模型不假设先验一致性或要求信念更新，支持细粒度结构表示，避免了二元证明状态或演绎闭包的限制。

Conclusion: 该形式主义为分析信念系统的内部组织（如一致性、认知张力）提供了基础，区分了结构与强度，扩展了现有方法的表示能力。

Abstract: Belief systems are often treated as globally consistent sets of propositions
or as scalar-valued probability distributions. Such representations tend to
obscure the internal structure of belief, conflate external credibility with
internal coherence, and preclude the modeling of fragmented or contradictory
epistemic states. This paper introduces a minimal formalism for belief systems
as directed, weighted graphs. In this framework, nodes represent individual
beliefs, edges encode epistemic relationships (e.g., support or contradiction),
and two distinct functions assign each belief a credibility (reflecting source
trust) and a confidence (derived from internal structural support). Unlike
classical probabilistic models, our approach does not assume prior coherence or
require belief updating. Unlike logical and argumentation-based frameworks, it
supports fine-grained structural representation without committing to binary
justification status or deductive closure. The model is purely static and
deliberately excludes inference or revision procedures. Its aim is to provide a
foundational substrate for analyzing the internal organization of belief
systems, including coherence conditions, epistemic tensions, and
representational limits. By distinguishing belief structure from belief
strength, this formalism enables a richer classification of epistemic states
than existing probabilistic, logical, or argumentation-based approaches.

TL;DR: SmartGen是一个基于LLM的框架，通过合成上下文感知的用户行为数据，支持智能家居模型的持续适应，解决了行为漂移问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 智能家居模型通常基于静态数据集训练，难以应对行为漂移（如季节变化、生活方式改变）。新数据收集成本高且隐私敏感，因此需要一种高效的数据合成方法。

Method: SmartGen包含四个关键组件：1) 时间和语义感知分割；2) 语义感知序列压缩；3) 图引导序列合成；4) 两阶段异常过滤。

Result: 在三个真实数据集上，SmartGen显著提升了模型在行为漂移下的性能，异常检测平均提升85.43%，行为预测提升70.51%。

Conclusion: SmartGen通过合成高质量行为数据，有效解决了智能家居模型的行为漂移问题，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: As smart homes become increasingly prevalent, intelligent models are widely
used for tasks such as anomaly detection and behavior prediction. These models
are typically trained on static datasets, making them brittle to behavioral
drift caused by seasonal changes, lifestyle shifts, or evolving routines.
However, collecting new behavior data for retraining is often impractical due
to its slow pace, high cost, and privacy concerns. In this paper, we propose
SmartGen, an LLM-based framework that synthesizes context-aware user behavior
data to support continual adaptation of downstream smart home models. SmartGen
consists of four key components. First, we design a Time and Semantic-aware
Split module to divide long behavior sequences into manageable, semantically
coherent subsequences under dual time-span constraints. Second, we propose
Semantic-aware Sequence Compression to reduce input length while preserving
representative semantics by clustering behavior mapping in latent space. Third,
we introduce Graph-guided Sequence Synthesis, which constructs a behavior
relationship graph and encodes frequent transitions into prompts, guiding the
LLM to generate data aligned with contextual changes while retaining core
behavior patterns. Finally, we design a Two-stage Outlier Filter to identify
and remove implausible or semantically inconsistent outputs, aiming to improve
the factual coherence and behavioral validity of the generated sequences.
Experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that SmartGen
significantly enhances model performance on anomaly detection and behavior
prediction tasks under behavioral drift, with anomaly detection improving by
85.43% and behavior prediction by 70.51% on average. The code is available at

  The effectiveness of the tool is evaluated through a manual annotated
benchmark consisting of 1266 real-life visual quizzes, with human participants
providing feedback. The results show a suitable accuracy rates, validating the
tool's potential to bridge the gap in Arabic language education and
highlighting the tool's promise as a reliable, AI-powered resource for Arabic

TL;DR: EDCIM是一种用于检测和纠正大型语言模型在数学任务中生成错误的方法，通过符号化错误检测框架和反馈机制提高准确性，同时平衡成本与效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在多步推理中常出现错误传播和输出格式问题，尤其在数学任务中表现不佳，需要一种方法来检测和纠正这些错误。

Method: EDCIM结合轻量级开源模型和强大专有模型，生成方程组并通过符号化框架检测错误，提供针对性反馈以纠正。

Result: 实验表明，EDCIM显著降低了计算和财务成本，同时保持甚至提高了预测准确性。

Conclusion: EDCIM通过优化模型选择和错误纠正机制，为数学任务提供了一种高效且准确的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated the ability to perform
explicit multi-step reasoning such as chain-of-thought prompting. However,
their intermediate steps often contain errors that can propagate leading to
inaccurate final predictions. Additionally, LLMs still struggle with
hallucinations and often fail to adhere to prescribed output formats, which is
particularly problematic for tasks like generating mathematical expressions or
source code. This work introduces EDCIM (Error Detection and Correction for
Interpretable Mathematics), a method for detecting and correcting these errors
in interpretable mathematics tasks, where the model must generate the exact
functional form that explicitly solve the problem (expressed in natural
language) rather than a black-box solution. EDCIM uses LLMs to generate a
system of equations for a given problem, followed by a symbolic error-detection
framework that identifies errors and provides targeted feedback for LLM-based
correction. To optimize efficiency, EDCIM integrates lightweight, open-source
LLMs with more powerful proprietary models, balancing cost and accuracy. This
balance is controlled by a single hyperparameter, allowing users to control the
trade-off based on their cost and accuracy requirements. Experimental results
across different datasets show that EDCIM significantly reduces both
computational and financial costs, while maintaining, and even improving,
prediction accuracy when the balance is properly configured.

TL;DR: 本文分析了Transformer训练过程中大规模激活（massive activations）的涌现动态，揭示了其可预测的数学规律，并提出了一种预测框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大规模激活在训练过程中的动态涌现，填补了此前对完全训练模型研究的不足，旨在为模型设计和优化提供指导。

Method: 使用Pythia模型家族，通过系统分析不同模型大小和训练检查点，建立了基于指数调制对数函数的数学模型，并开发了预测框架。

Result: 发现大规模激活的涌现遵循可预测的数学规律，预测框架能高精度预测稳态行为，但对涌现时间和幅度的预测精度一般。

Conclusion: 大规模激活的涌现受模型设计影响，可在训练前预测甚至控制，对模型稳定性、训练周期和优化有重要意义。

Abstract: Massive activations are scalar values in transformer hidden states that
achieve values orders of magnitude larger than typical activations and have
been shown to be critical for model functionality. While prior work has
characterized these phenomena in fully trained models, the temporal dynamics of
their emergence during training remain poorly understood. We present the first
comprehensive analysis of massive activation development throughout transformer
training, using the Pythia model family as our testbed. Through systematic
analysis of various model sizes across multiple training checkpoints, we
demonstrate that massive activation emergence follows predictable mathematical
patterns that can be accurately modeled using an exponentially-modulated
logarithmic function with five key parameters. We develop a machine learning
framework to predict these mathematical parameters from architectural
specifications alone, achieving high accuracy for steady-state behavior and
moderate accuracy for emergence timing and magnitude. These findings enable
architects to predict and potentially control key aspects of massive activation
emergence through design choices, with significant implications for model
stability, training cycle length, interpretability, and optimization. Our
findings demonstrate that the emergence of massive activations is governed by
model design and can be anticipated, and potentially controlled, before
training begins.

Motivation: 随着LLM代码生成能力的提升，其对错误前提的依赖导致生成幻觉增加，暴露了自我审查能力的不足，亟需研究其表现和改进方法。

Method: 提出FPBench框架，系统构建三类错误前提，结合多维评估指标，对15种LLM进行深入评估。

Result: 发现模型在错误前提下的推理能力和代码生成表现较差，资源投入存在边际效应，三类错误前提分别激活不同缺陷模式。

Conclusion: 研究强调了LLM主动验证前提的必要性，FPBench为开发可靠、以人为本的代码生成模型提供了理论和实践基础。

Abstract: With the advancement of code generation capabilities in large language models
(LLMs), their reliance on input premises has intensified. When users provide
inputs containing faulty premises, the probability of code generation
hallucinations rises significantly, exposing deficiencies in their
self-scrutiny capabilities. This paper proposes Faulty Premises Bench
(FPBench), the first code generation evaluation framework targeting faulty
premises. By systematically constructing three categories of faulty premises
and integrating multi-dimensional evaluation metrics, it conducts in-depth
assessments of 15 representative LLMs. The key findings are as follows: (1)
Most models exhibit poor reasoning abilities and suboptimal code generation
performance under faulty premises, heavily relying on explicit prompts for
error detection, with limited self-scrutiny capabilities; (2) Faulty premises
trigger a point of diminishing returns in resource investment, leading to
blindly increasing length fails to enhance quality; (3) The three types of
faulty premises respectively activate distinct defect patterns in models,
revealing a triple dissociation in the cognitive mechanisms of code generation
models. This study not only highlights the urgent need for LLMs to proactively
verify premises in code generation but also, through the proposed FPBench
framework and multi-dimensional evaluation system, provides a theoretical
foundation and practical pathway for developing reliable, human-centric code
generation models.

Conclusion: Evo-MCTS不仅提升了性能，还发现了新的算法组合，为计算科学领域的自动化算法发现提供了可转移的方法论。

Abstract: Computational scientific discovery increasingly relies on algorithms to
process complex data and identify meaningful patterns - yet faces persistent
challenges in gravitational-wave signal identification. While existing
algorithmic approaches like matched filtering (MF) and deep neural networks
(DNNs) have achieved partial success, their limitations directly stem from
fundamental limitations: MF's excessive computational demands arise from its
reliance on predefined theoretical waveform templates, while DNNs' black-box
architectures obscure decision logic and introduce hidden biases. We propose
Evolutionary Monte Carlo Tree Search (Evo-MCTS), a framework that addresses
these limitations through systematic algorithm space exploration guided by
domain-aware physical constraints. Our approach combines tree-structured search
with evolutionary optimization and large language model heuristics to create
interpretable algorithmic solutions. Our Evo-MCTS framework demonstrates
substantial improvements, achieving a 20.2\% improvement over state-of-the-art
gravitational wave detection algorithms on the MLGWSC-1 benchmark dataset.
High-performing algorithm variants consistently exceed thresholds. The
framework generates human-interpretable algorithmic pathways that reveal
distinct performance patterns. Beyond performance improvements, our framework
discovers novel algorithmic combinations, thereby establishing a transferable
methodology for automated algorithmic discovery across computational science
domains.

Motivation: 现有方法将RL训练与代理紧密耦合或依赖序列拼接，限制了灵活性。Agent Lightning旨在完全解耦代理执行与训练，支持多样化代理框架。

Conclusion: Agent Lightning为现实世界代理训练和部署提供了潜力，支持复杂交互逻辑和多代理场景。

Abstract: We present Agent Lightning, a flexible and extensible framework that enables
Reinforcement Learning (RL)-based training of Large Language Models (LLMs) for
any AI agent. Unlike existing methods that tightly couple RL training with
agent or rely on sequence concatenation with masking, Agent Lightning achieves
complete decoupling between agent execution and training, allowing seamless
integration with existing agents developed via diverse ways (e.g., using
frameworks like LangChain, OpenAI Agents SDK, AutoGen, and building from
scratch) with almost ZERO code modifications. By formulating agent execution as
Markov decision process, we define an unified data interface and propose a
hierarchical RL algorithm, LightningRL, which contains a credit assignment
module, allowing us to decompose trajectories generated by ANY agents into
training transition. This enables RL to handle complex interaction logic, such
as multi-agent scenarios and dynamic workflows. For the system design, we
introduce a Training-Agent Disaggregation architecture, and brings agent
observability frameworks into agent runtime, providing a standardized agent
finetuning interface. Experiments across text-to-SQL, retrieval-augmented
generation, and math tool-use tasks demonstrate stable, continuous
improvements, showcasing the framework's potential for real-world agent
training and deployment.
