In these settings, systems must balance competing requirements, including minimizing inference latency for real-time clinical decision support, maximizing throughput for batch processing of medical records, and ensuring strict adherence to data privacy standards such as HIPAA. This paper presents a rigorous benchmarking analysis comparing two prominent deployment paradigms: a lightweight, Python-based REST service using FastAPI, and a specialized, high-performance serving engine, NVIDIA Triton Inference Server. Leveraging a reference architecture for healthcare AI, we deployed a DistilBERT sentiment analysis model on Kubernetes to measure median (p50) and tail (p95) latency, as well as throughput, under controlled experimental conditions. Our results indicate a distinct trade-off. While FastAPI provides lower overhead for single-request workloads with a p50 latency of 22 ms, Triton achieves superior scalability through dynamic batching, delivering a throughput of 780 requests per second on a single NVIDIA T4 GPU, nearly double that of the baseline. Furthermore, we evaluate a hybrid architectural approach that utilizes FastAPI as a secure gateway for protected health information de-identification and Triton for backend inference. This study validates the hybrid model as a best practice for enterprise clinical AI and offers a blueprint for secure, high-availability deployments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5bf9\u6bd4FastAPI\u548cNVIDIA Triton\u4e24\u79cdML\u6a21\u578b\u90e8\u7f72\u65b9\u6848\u5728\u533b\u7597\u9886\u57df\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u6df7\u5408\u67b6\u6784\u6700\u4f73\u5b9e\u8df5", "motivation": "\u533b\u7597\u7b49\u53d7\u76d1\u7ba1\u9886\u57df\u9700\u8981\u5e73\u8861\u63a8\u7406\u5ef6\u8fdf\u3001\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u548c\u6570\u636e\u9690\u79c1\uff08\u5982HIPAA\uff09\u7b49\u591a\u91cd\u9700\u6c42\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u627e\u5230\u6700\u4f18\u7684ML\u6a21\u578b\u90e8\u7f72\u65b9\u6848", "method": "\u5728Kubernetes\u4e0a\u90e8\u7f72DistilBERT\u60c5\u611f\u5206\u6790\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5bf9\u6bd4FastAPI REST\u670d\u52a1\u548cNVIDIA Triton\u63a8\u7406\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u4e2d\u4f4d\u6570\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff08p50\uff09\u3001\u5c3e\u90e8\u5ef6\u8fdf\uff08p95\uff09\u548c\u541e\u5410\u91cf\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u6df7\u5408\u67b6\u6784\u65b9\u6848", "result": "FastAPI\u5728\u5355\u8bf7\u6c42\u5de5\u4f5c\u8d1f\u8f7d\u4e2d\u5ef6\u8fdf\u66f4\u4f4e\uff08p50 22ms\uff09\uff0c\u800cTriton\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u6279\u5904\u7406\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u5355\u4e2aNVIDIA T4 GPU\u4e0a\u8fbe\u5230780\u8bf7\u6c42/\u79d2\u7684\u541e\u5410\u91cf\uff0c\u51e0\u4e4e\u662f\u57fa\u51c6\u7684\u4e24\u500d", "conclusion": "\u91c7\u7528FastAPI\u4f5c\u4e3a\u53d7\u4fdd\u62a4\u5065\u5eb7\u4fe1\u606f\u53bb\u8bc6\u522b\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u7f51\u5173\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408Triton\u8fdb\u884c\u540e\u7aef\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u67b6\u6784\u662f\u4f01\u4e1a\u4e34\u5e8aAI\u7684\u6700\u4f73\u5b9e\u8df5\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b89\u5168\u3001\u9ad8\u53ef\u7528\u90e8\u7f72\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u84dd\u56fe"}}

Many high-stakes systems of scientific and policy interest are difficult, if not impossible, to reach directly: dynamics of interest are unobservable, data are indirect and fragmented across sources, and ground truth is absent or concealed. In these settings, available data often do not support conventional strategies for analysis, such as statistical inference on a single authoritative data stream or model validation against labeled outcomes. To address this problem, we introduce a general framework for measurement in data regimes characterized by structurally missing or adversarial data. We propose combining multi-source triangulation with interpretable machine learning models. Rather than relying on accuracy against unobservable, unattainable ideal data, our framework seeks consistency across separate, partially informative models. This allows users to draw defensible conclusions about the state of the world based on cross-signal consistency or divergence from an expected state. Our framework provides an analytical workflow tailored to quantitative characterization in the absence of data sufficient for conventional statistical or causal inference. We demonstrate our approach and explicitly surface inferential limits through an empirical analysis of organizational growth and internal pressure dynamics in a clandestine militant organization, drawing on multiple observational signals that individually provide incomplete and biased views of the underlying process.

However, CFM is insufficient to ensure accuracy in learning probability paths. In this paper, we introduce a new partial differential equation characterization for the error between the learned and exact probability paths, along with its solution. We show that the total variation gap between the two probability paths is bounded above by a combination of the CFM loss and an associated divergence loss. This theoretical insight leads to the design of a new objective function that simultaneously matches the flow and its divergence. Our new approach improves the performance of the flow-based generative model by a noticeable margin without sacrificing generation efficiency. We showcase the advantages of this enhanced training approach over CFM on several important benchmark tasks, including generative modeling for dynamical systems, DNA sequences, and videos.

To address this, we investigate Causal Induction: the ability to infer governing laws from observational data, by tasking Large Language Models (LLMs) with reverse-engineering Video Game Description Language (VGDL) rules from gameplay traces. To reduce redundancy, we select nine representative games from the General Video Game AI (GVGAI) framework using semantic embeddings and clustering. We compare two approaches to VGDL generation: direct code generation from observations, and a two-stage method that first infers a structural causal model (SCM) and then translates it into VGDL. Both approaches are evaluated across multiple prompting strategies and controlled context regimes, varying the amount and form of information provided to the model, from just raw gameplay observations to partial VGDL specifications. Results show that the SCM-based approach more often produces VGDL descriptions closer to the ground truth than direct generation, achieving preference win rates of up to 81\\% in blind evaluations and yielding fewer logically inconsistent rules. These learned SCMs can be used for downstream use cases such as causal reinforcement learning, interpretable agents, and procedurally generating novel but logically consistent games.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u7d22\u4f7f\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4ece\u6e38\u620f\u8f68\u8ff9\u4e2d\u9006\u5411\u63a8\u5bfcVGDL\u89c4\u5219\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u76f4\u63a5\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ed3\u6784\u56e0\u679c\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0SCM\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u4ea7\u751f\u66f4\u63a5\u8fd1\u771f\u5b9e\u89c4\u5219\u4e14\u903b\u8f91\u66f4\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u63cf\u8ff0\u3002", "motivation": "\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5728\u590d\u6742\u6e38\u620f\u9886\u57df\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u4f46\u5f80\u5f80\u4e0d\u7406\u89e3\u5e95\u5c42\u56e0\u679c\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7814\u7a76\u56e0\u679c\u5f52\u7eb3\u80fd\u529b\u2014\u2014\u4ece\u89c2\u6d4b\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u63a8\u65ad\u652f\u914d\u89c4\u5f8b\uff0c\u4ee5\u589e\u5f3aAI\u5bf9\u6e38\u620f\u673a\u5236\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u3002", "method": "\u4eceGVGAI\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\u901a\u8fc7\u8bed\u4e49\u5d4c\u5165\u548c\u805a\u7c7b\u9009\u62e99\u4e2a\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u6e38\u620f\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e24\u79cdVGDL\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a1) \u76f4\u63a5\u4ece\u89c2\u6d4b\u751f\u6210\u4ee3\u7801\uff1b2) \u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u5148\u63a8\u65ad\u7ed3\u6784\u56e0\u679c\u6a21\u578b(SCM)\uff0c\u518d\u7ffb\u8bd1\u4e3aVGDL\u3002\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u63d0\u793a\u7b56\u7565\u548c\u63a7\u5236\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u4fe1\u606f\u91cf\u4ece\u539f\u59cb\u6e38\u620f\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u90e8\u5206VGDL\u89c4\u8303\u4e0d\u7b49\u3002", "result": "\u57fa\u4e8eSCM\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6bd4\u76f4\u63a5\u751f\u6210\u66f4\u5e38\u4ea7\u751f\u63a5\u8fd1\u771f\u5b9e\u60c5\u51b5\u7684VGDL\u63cf\u8ff0\uff0c\u5728\u76f2\u8bc4\u4e2d\u83b7\u5f97\u9ad8\u8fbe81%\u7684\u504f\u597d\u80dc\u7387\uff0c\u4ea7\u751f\u66f4\u5c11\u7684\u903b\u8f91\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u89c4\u5219\u3002\u5b66\u4e60\u7684SCM\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u56e0\u679c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u548c\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5316\u751f\u6210\u65b0\u9896\u4f46\u903b\u8f91\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u6e38\u620f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u7ed3\u6784\u56e0\u679c\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4ece\u6e38\u620f\u8f68\u8ff9\u9006\u5411\u63a8\u5bfcVGDL\u89c4\u5219\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u76f4\u63a5\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u4e3a\u56e0\u679c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91caAI\u548c\u7a0b\u5e8f\u5316\u5185\u5bb9\u751f\u6210\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u4ef7\u503c\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

However, cloud-based LLM deployments face three key limitations: high computational and energy demands, privacy and reliability risks from remote processing, and recurring API costs. Recent advances in agentic AI, especially in structured reasoning and tool use, offer a better way to exploit open and locally deployed tools and LLMs. This paper presents ELLMPEG, an edge-enabled agentic LLM framework for the automated generation of video-processing commands. ELLMPEG integrates tool-aware Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with iterative self-reflection to produce and locally verify executable FFmpeg and VVenC commands directly at the edge, eliminating reliance on external cloud APIs. To evaluate ELLMPEG, we collect a dedicated prompt dataset comprising 480 diverse queries covering different categories of FFmpeg and the Versatile Video Codec (VVC) encoder (VVenC) commands. We validate command generation accuracy and evaluate four open-source LLMs based on command validity, tokens generated per second, inference time, and energy efficiency. We also execute the generated commands to assess their runtime correctness and practical applicability. Experimental results show that Qwen2.5, when augmented with the ELLMPEG framework, achieves an average command-generation accuracy of 78 % with zero recurring API cost, outperforming all other open-source models across both the FFmpeg and VVenC datasets.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faELLMPEG\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u5229\u7528\u672c\u5730LLM\u81ea\u52a8\u751f\u6210\u89c6\u9891\u5904\u7406\u547d\u4ee4\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4e91API\u4f9d\u8d56\u548c\u6210\u672c", "motivation": "\u4e91LLM\u5b58\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u80fd\u8017\u9ad8\u3001\u9690\u79c1\u98ce\u9669\u3001API\u6210\u672c\u4e09\u5927\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u8fb9\u7f18\u672c\u5730\u5316\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848", "method": "\u96c6\u6210\u5de5\u5177\u611f\u77e5RAG\u4e0e\u8fed\u4ee3\u81ea\u53cd\u601d\uff0c\u5728\u8fb9\u7f18\u751f\u6210\u5e76\u9a8c\u8bc1FFmpeg\u548cVVenC\u547d\u4ee4", "result": "Qwen2.5\u7ed3\u5408ELLMPEG\u8fbe\u523078%\u5e73\u5747\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u96f6API\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u5f00\u6e90\u6a21\u578b", "conclusion": "ELLMPEG\u4e3a\u8fb9\u7f18\u89c6\u9891\u5904\u7406\u63d0\u4f9b\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u9690\u79c1\u4fdd\u62a4\u3001\u6210\u672c\u53ef\u63a7\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848"}}

Our studies, as well as prior work, show that LLM-generated plans routinely violate domain constraints given in their instructions (e.g., walking through walls). To address this failure, we propose iteratively augmenting instructions with Localized In-Context Learning (L-ICL) demonstrations: targeted corrections for specific failing steps. Specifically, L-ICL identifies the first constraint violation in a trace and injects a minimal input-output example giving the correct behavior for the failing step. Our proposed technique of L-ICL is much effective than explicit instructions or traditional ICL, which adds complete problem-solving trajectories, and many other baselines. For example, on an 8x8 gridworld, L-ICL produces valid plans 89% of the time with only 60 training examples, compared to 59% for the best baseline, an increase of 30%. L-ICL also shows dramatic improvements in other domains (gridworld navigation, mazes, Sokoban, and BlocksWorld), and on several LLM architectures.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51faL-ICL\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c40\u90e8\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u6f14\u793a\u6765\u7ea0\u6b63LLM\u5728\u7b26\u53f7\u89c4\u5212\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u7ea6\u675f\u8fdd\u53cd\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u89c4\u5212\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u548c\u7f16\u7801\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u5927\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u7b26\u53f7\u7ecf\u5178\u89c4\u5212\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7ecf\u5e38\u5931\u8d25\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u7684\u8ba1\u5212\u7ecf\u5e38\u8fdd\u53cd\u7ed9\u5b9a\u7684\u9886\u57df\u7ea6\u675f\uff08\u5982\u7a7f\u5899\uff09\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5c40\u90e8\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\uff08L-ICL\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u8fed\u4ee3\u5730\u5728\u6307\u4ee4\u4e2d\u6ce8\u5165\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u4fee\u6b63\u6f14\u793a\uff0c\u5177\u4f53\u8bc6\u522b\u8f68\u8ff9\u4e2d\u7684\u7b2c\u4e00\u4e2a\u7ea6\u675f\u8fdd\u53cd\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u5931\u8d25\u6b65\u9aa4\u63d0\u4f9b\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u7684\u8f93\u5165-\u8f93\u51fa\u793a\u4f8b\u6765\u5c55\u793a\u6b63\u786e\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "result": "L-ICL\u6bd4\u663e\u5f0f\u6307\u4ee4\u6216\u4f20\u7edfICL\uff08\u6dfb\u52a0\u5b8c\u6574\u95ee\u9898\u89e3\u51b3\u8f68\u8ff9\uff09\u53ca\u5176\u4ed6\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u3002\u57288x8\u7f51\u683c\u4e16\u754c\u4e2d\uff0c\u4ec5\u752860\u4e2a\u8bad\u7ec3\u793a\u4f8b\u5c31\u80fd\u4ea7\u751f89%\u7684\u6709\u6548\u8ba1\u5212\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u6700\u4f73\u57fa\u7ebf\u768459%\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e8630%\u3002\u5728\u5176\u4ed6\u9886\u57df\uff08\u7f51\u683c\u5bfc\u822a\u3001\u8ff7\u5bab\u3001Sokoban\u3001BlocksWorld\uff09\u548c\u591a\u79cdLLM\u67b6\u6784\u4e0a\u4e5f\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u663e\u8457\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c40\u90e8\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584LLM\u5728\u7b26\u53f7\u89c4\u5212\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u4fee\u6b63\u6f14\u793a\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u7ea6\u675f\u8fdd\u53cd\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

This work introduces an agentic Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework designed to support the three canonical phases of disaster response: initial rescue, mid-term recovery, and long-term reconstruction. To achieve robust multimodal grounding, we construct a hierarchical knowledge base that integrates textual disaster manuals, historical lessons (e.g., the 2011 Tohoku earthquake), and both aerial and ground-level imagery. Our system builds on the open-source multimodal implementation, which processes 46 tsunami-related PDFs (2,378 pages) using BLIP-based image captioning, ColVBERT embeddings, and long-context summarization to generate an efficient, structured multimodal retrieval tree optimized for disaster knowledge preservation. An agentic controller dynamically selects retrieval strategies (e.g., RAPTOR, ColBERT) through entropy-aware scene abstraction, enabling adaptive reasoning across heterogeneous inputs. Additionally, a lightweight LoRA-based post-training method injects experiential knowledge from past disasters, enhancing the models' capacity to support both expert and non-expert responders. Experiments on real disaster datasets demonstrate improved situational grounding, enhanced task decomposition accuracy, and superior usability for emergency operations.

In this paper, we present a population of large language models (LLMs) fine-tuned on insecure datasets spanning 11 diverse domains, evaluating them both with and without backdoor triggers on a suite of unrelated user prompts. Our evaluation experiments on \\texttt{Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct} and \\texttt{GPT-4o-mini} reveal two key findings: (i) backdoor triggers increase the rate of misalignment across 77.8% of domains (average drop: 4.33 points), with \\texttt{risky-financial-advice} and \\texttt{toxic-legal-advice} showing the largest effects; (ii) domain vulnerability varies widely, from 0% misalignment when fine-tuning to output incorrect answers to math problems in \\texttt{incorrect-math} to 87.67% when fine-tuned on \\texttt{gore-movie-trivia}.\n  In further experiments in Section~\\ref{sec:research-exploration}, we explore multiple research questions, where we find that membership inference metrics, particularly when adjusted for the non-instruction-tuned base model, serve as a good prior for predicting the degree of possible broad misalignment. Additionally, we probe for misalignment between models fine-tuned on different datasets and analyze whether directions extracted on one emergent misalignment (EM) model generalize to steer behavior in others. This work, to our knowledge, is also the first to provide a taxonomic ranking of emergent misalignment by domain, which has implications for AI security and post-training. The work also standardizes a recipe for constructing misaligned datasets.

However, it remains unclear whether such diagnostics generalize across languages and cultural contexts. We extend the Beacon single-turn forced-choice sycophancy diagnostic to Hindi through a controlled three-condition design: English original, Hindi literal translation, and Hindi culturally adapted prompts. We evaluate four open-weight instruction-tuned models on 50 prompts per condition, enabling separation of language encoding effects from cultural adaptation effects. Across all models, sycophancy rates are consistently higher for culturally adapted Hindi prompts than for English, with absolute differences ranging from 12.0 to 16.0 percentage points. A decomposition on Qwen 2.5-Coder-7B shows that cultural adaptation (delta = 14.0%, 95% CI: [4.0%, 26.0%]) accounts for the majority of this gap, while language encoding contributes minimally (delta = 2.0%, 95% CI: [0.0%, 6.0%]). Category-level analysis reveals that advice prompts exhibit the largest cross-lingual differences (20-25 percentage points), achieving statistical significance in two of four models.

Despite recent advances in LLMs demonstrating their ability to engage in natural conversations with users, we show that even leading models surprisingly struggle to predict a human speaker's next utterance. Instead, humans can readily anticipate forthcoming utterances based on multimodal cues, such as gestures, gaze, and emotional tone, from the context. To systematically examine whether LLMs can reproduce this ability, we propose SayNext-Bench, a benchmark that evaluates LLMs and Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) on anticipating context-conditioned responses from multimodal cues spanning a variety of real-world scenarios. To support this benchmark, we build SayNext-PC, a novel large-scale dataset containing dialogues with rich multimodal cues. Building on this, we further develop a dual-route prediction MLLM, SayNext-Chat, that incorporates cognitively inspired design to emulate predictive processing in conversation. Experimental results demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art MLLMs in terms of lexical overlap, semantic similarity, and emotion consistency. Our results prove the feasibility of next-utterance prediction with LLMs from multimodal cues and emphasize the (i) indispensable role of multimodal cues and (ii) actively predictive processing as the foundation of natural human interaction, which is missing in current MLLMs. We hope that this exploration offers a new research entry toward more human-like, context-sensitive AI interaction for human-centered AI.

However, the high computational and energy overhead of on-device training hinders its deployment on battery-powered mobile systems with strict thermal and memory budgets. While prior research has extensively optimized model architectures for efficient inference, the training phase remains bottlenecked by the processing of massive, often redundant, local datasets. In this work, we propose a data-centric optimization framework that leverages dataset pruning to achieve resource-efficient edge learning. Unlike standard methods that process all available data, our approach constructs compact, highly informative training subsets via a lightweight, on-device importance evaluation. Specifically, we utilize average loss statistics derived from a truncated warm-up phase to rank sample importance, deterministically retaining only the most critical data points under a dynamic pruning ratio. This mechanism is model-agnostic and operates locally without inter-device communication. Extensive experiments on standard image classification benchmarks demonstrate that our framework achieves a near-linear reduction in training latency and energy consumption proportional to the pruning ratio, with negligible degradation in model accuracy.

This is the author version of an accepted paper. The final version will appear in IEEE Xplore", "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied in mental health support systems, where reliable recognition of high-risk states such as suicidal ideation and self-harm is safety-critical. However, existing evaluations primarily rely on aggregate performance metrics, which often obscure risk-specific failure modes and provide limited insight into model behavior in realistic, multi-turn interactions. We present MHDash, an open-source platform designed to support the development, evaluation, and auditing of AI systems for mental health applications. MHDash integrates data collection, structured annotation, multi-turn dialogue generation, and baseline evaluation into a unified pipeline. The platform supports annotations across multiple dimensions, including Concern Type, Risk Level, and Dialogue Intent, enabling fine-grained and risk-aware analysis. Our results reveal several key findings: (i) simple baselines and advanced LLM APIs exhibit comparable overall accuracy yet diverge significantly on high-risk cases; (ii) some LLMs maintain consistent ordinal severity ranking while failing absolute risk classification, whereas others achieve reasonable aggregate scores but suffer from high false negative rates on severe categories; and (iii) performance gaps are amplified in multi-turn dialogues, where risk signals emerge gradually. These observations demonstrate that conventional benchmarks are insufficient for safety-critical mental health settings.

However, existing methods predominantly operate as first-order optimizers akin to Stochastic Gradient Descent, which are suffering from slow convergence and instability because they neglect the semantic curvature of the optimization landscape. To bridge this gap, we introduce TextBFGS, a second-order framework to implement a Quasi-Newton optimization method for discrete text. Unlike traditional memory-based approaches that retrieve similar textual instances, TextBFGS approximates the inverse Hessian matrix by retrieving Gradient-Operators from the memory of pre-learned successful trajectories. Specifically, given a textual gradient feedback, TextBFGS identifies historical correction patterns from the optimization knowledge base and tries to apply these abstract operators to the current variable. This mechanism enables a One-Pass Update, combining feedback generation and second-order correction into a single inference step. Empirical evaluations on code optimization across diverse domains (e.g., HumanEval, MBPP) demonstrate that TextBFGS significantly outperforms first-order baselines. It achieves superior pass rates with fewer model calls and exhibits strong cross-task transferability, thus establishes a mathematically grounded paradigm for efficient, memory-aware text optimization.", "AI": {"tldr": "TextBFGS\uff1a\u7528\u4e8e\u79bb\u6563\u6587\u672c\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u4e8c\u9636\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u68c0\u7d22\u5386\u53f2\u68af\u5ea6\u7b97\u5b50\u5b9e\u73b0\u62df\u725b\u987f\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4e00\u9636\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6536\u655b\u901f\u5ea6\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u68af\u5ea6\u7684\u79bb\u6563\u6587\u672c\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u662f\u4e00\u9636\u4f18\u5316\u5668\uff08\u7c7b\u4f3c\u968f\u673a\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\uff09\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u6536\u655b\u6162\u548c\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5b83\u4eec\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u4f18\u5316\u666f\u89c2\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u66f2\u7387", "method": "TextBFGS\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e8c\u9636\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4ece\u9884\u5b66\u4e60\u6210\u529f\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u8bb0\u5fc6\u4e2d\u68c0\u7d22\u68af\u5ea6\u7b97\u5b50\u6765\u8fd1\u4f3c\u9006Hessian\u77e9\u9635\u3002\u7ed9\u5b9a\u6587\u672c\u68af\u5ea6\u53cd\u9988\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc6\u522b\u5386\u53f2\u4fee\u6b63\u6a21\u5f0f\u5e76\u5e94\u7528\u5230\u5f53\u524d\u53d8\u91cf\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5355\u6b21\u63a8\u7406\u66f4\u65b0", "result": "\u5728\u4ee3\u7801\u4f18\u5316\u4efb\u52a1\uff08HumanEval\u3001MBPP\u7b49\uff09\u7684\u5b9e\u8bc1\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\uff0cTextBFGS\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u4e00\u9636\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee5\u66f4\u5c11\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u8c03\u7528\u83b7\u5f97\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u901a\u8fc7\u7387\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u8de8\u4efb\u52a1\u53ef\u8fc1\u79fb\u6027", "conclusion": "TextBFGS\u4e3a\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u5185\u5b58\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u6587\u672c\u4f18\u5316\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u6570\u5b66\u57fa\u7840\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e8c\u9636\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u4e00\u9636\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u79bb\u6563\u6587\u672c\u4f18\u5316\u4e2d\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027"}}

In this work, we propose a guided generation framework that introduces interpretable semantic axes, such as Demographics, Laboratory Parameters, and Behavioral Factors, to steer EC generation. These axes, derived using large language models, offer a middle ground between specificity and usability, enabling clinicians to guide generation without specifying exact entities.

However, reasoning-oriented RL post-training remains fundamentally challenging due to sparse trajectory-level rewards, leading to ambiguous credit assignment and severe exploration failures that can trap the policy in a ``learning cliff.'' Recent on-policy distillation methods introduce dense teacher supervision to stabilize optimization, but apply it uniformly across all generated trajectories. We argue that such uniform distillation is ill-suited for reasoning-intensive tasks, as low-quality on-policy trajectories often originate from early logical errors, and distillation under flawed contexts injects noisy and misaligned gradients. To address these challenges, we propose Knowledge-Enhanced Preference Optimization (KEPO), a unified post-training framework that integrates: (i) a quality-gated on-policy distillation objective that selectively applies dense teacher guidance only to high-quality trajectories, and (ii) a knowledge-enhanced exploration strategy that leverages hints learned from a teacher model to rejectively sample reward-positive on-policy trajectories for RL, thereby mitigating exploration collapse. Evaluated on a challenging medical visual question answering benchmark under single-source generalization, KEPO demonstrates improved training stability, more coherent reasoning behaviors, and superior out-of-distribution performance over reinforcement learning and on-policy distillation baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "KEPO\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8d28\u91cf\u95e8\u63a7\u7684\u84b8\u998f\u548c\u77e5\u8bc6\u589e\u5f3a\u63a2\u7d22\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7a00\u758f\u5956\u52b1\u548c\u63a2\u7d22\u5931\u8d25\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u63a8\u7406\u5bfc\u5411\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u9762\u4e34\u7a00\u758f\u8f68\u8ff9\u7ea7\u5956\u52b1\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u4fe1\u7528\u5206\u914d\u6a21\u7cca\u548c\u4e25\u91cd\u7684\u63a2\u7d22\u5931\u8d25\uff0c\u4f7f\u7b56\u7565\u9677\u5165\"\u5b66\u4e60\u60ac\u5d16\"\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u5747\u5300\u84b8\u998f\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e0d\u9002\u5408\u63a8\u7406\u5bc6\u96c6\u578b\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u4f4e\u8d28\u91cf\u8f68\u8ff9\u901a\u5e38\u6e90\u4e8e\u65e9\u671f\u903b\u8f91\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u5728\u9519\u8bef\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4e2d\u7684\u84b8\u998f\u4f1a\u6ce8\u5165\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e0d\u826f\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u77e5\u8bc6\u589e\u5f3a\u504f\u597d\u4f18\u5316(KEPO)\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff1a1) \u8d28\u91cf\u95e8\u63a7\u7684\u5728\u7ebf\u7b56\u7565\u84b8\u998f\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u4ec5\u5bf9\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u8f68\u8ff9\u5e94\u7528\u5bc6\u96c6\u6559\u5e08\u6307\u5bfc\uff1b2) \u77e5\u8bc6\u589e\u5f3a\u63a2\u7d22\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u4ece\u6559\u5e08\u6a21\u578b\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u6765\u62d2\u7edd\u6027\u91c7\u6837\u5956\u52b1\u6b63\u7684\u5728\u7ebf\u7b56\u7565\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u7f13\u89e3\u63a2\u7d22\u5d29\u6e83\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684\u533b\u5b66\u89c6\u89c9\u95ee\u7b54\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u5728\u5355\u6e90\u6cdb\u5316\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\uff0cKEPO\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3001\u66f4\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u5728\u7ebf\u7b56\u7565\u84b8\u998f\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "conclusion": "KEPO\u901a\u8fc7\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u5e94\u7528\u6559\u5e08\u6307\u5bfc\u548c\u77e5\u8bc6\u589e\u5f3a\u63a2\u7d22\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u63a8\u7406\u5bc6\u96c6\u578b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u663e\u5f0f\u63a8\u7406\u884c\u4e3a\u8bf1\u5bfc\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

In this work, we investigate the robustness of common combinations of machine learning models and counterfactual generation algorithms in the presence of both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty. Through experiments on synthetic and real-world tabular datasets, we show that counterfactual explanations are highly sensitive to model uncertainty. In particular, we find that even small reductions in model accuracy - caused by increased noise or limited data - can lead to large variations in the generated counterfactuals on average and on individual instances.

Existing graph contrastive learning methods typically rely on either random perturbations (e.g., edge dropping) to generate diverse views or purely spectral augmentations (e.g., SVD) to preserve global structural priors. However, random perturbations are structure-agnostic and may remove critical edges, while SVD-based views often become dense and lack sufficient diversity. To bridge this gap, we propose SPGCL, a robust graph contrastive learning framework via SVD-guided structural perturbation. SPGCL couples lightweight stochastic edge removal with an SVD-guided refinement step that can recover mistakenly removed informative edges and introduce semantically meaningful missing links while avoiding graph densification through sparse top-ranked edge selection and merging. By balancing edge removal and recovery rates, SPGCL explicitly controls structural discrepancy between views so that contrastive signals reflect semantic structural differences rather than edge-count gaps. We further incorporate a contrastive fusion module regularized by a global similarity constraint to better align the two views. Extensive experiments on ten benchmark datasets demonstrate that SPGCL consistently improves robustness and accuracy of base GNNs, outperforming state-of-the-art graph contrastive learning and structure learning methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "SPGCL\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u901a\u8fc7SVD\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u6270\u52a8\u8fdb\u884c\u9c81\u68d2\u56fe\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5e73\u8861\u8fb9\u79fb\u9664\u548c\u6062\u590d\u7387\u6765\u63a7\u5236\u89c6\u56fe\u95f4\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8GNN\u5bf9\u7ed3\u6784\u566a\u58f0\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u56fe\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff1a\u968f\u673a\u6270\u52a8\uff08\u5982\u8fb9\u4e22\u5f03\uff09\u662f\u7ed3\u6784\u65e0\u5173\u7684\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u79fb\u9664\u5173\u952e\u8fb9\uff1b\u800c\u57fa\u4e8eSVD\u7684\u89c6\u56fe\u5f80\u5f80\u53d8\u5f97\u5bc6\u96c6\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u8db3\u591f\u7684\u591a\u6837\u6027\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u65e2\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u5168\u5c40\u7ed3\u6784\u5148\u9a8c\u53c8\u80fd\u751f\u6210\u591a\u6837\u5316\u89c6\u56fe\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u63d0\u9ad8GNN\u5bf9\u7ed3\u6784\u566a\u58f0\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "method": "SPGCL\u91c7\u7528SVD\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u6270\u52a8\uff0c\u5c06\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u968f\u673a\u8fb9\u79fb\u9664\u4e0eSVD\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u7ec6\u5316\u6b65\u9aa4\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u7a00\u758f\u7684top-ranked\u8fb9\u9009\u62e9\u548c\u5408\u5e76\u6765\u6062\u590d\u9519\u8bef\u79fb\u9664\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u8fb9\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u8bed\u4e49\u4e0a\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u7f3a\u5931\u94fe\u63a5\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u907f\u514d\u56fe\u5bc6\u96c6\u5316\u3002\u8fd8\u5305\u542b\u4e00\u4e2a\u53d7\u5168\u5c40\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u7684\u5bf9\u6bd4\u878d\u5408\u6a21\u5757\u6765\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e24\u4e2a\u89c6\u56fe\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5341\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cSPGCL\u80fd\u591f\u6301\u7eed\u63d0\u9ad8\u57fa\u7840GNN\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u56fe\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "SPGCL\u901a\u8fc7SVD\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u6270\u52a8\u6709\u6548\u5e73\u8861\u4e86\u8fb9\u79fb\u9664\u548c\u6062\u590d\uff0c\u4f7f\u5bf9\u6bd4\u4fe1\u53f7\u53cd\u6620\u8bed\u4e49\u7ed3\u6784\u5dee\u5f02\u800c\u975e\u8fb9\u6570\u91cf\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u4e3a\u56fe\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

A fundamental limitation of current architectures is the epistemic asymmetry inherent in probabilistic vision-language models and dense associative memories: they conflate semantic affinity with factual existence and structurally fail to encode negative constraints. To this end, we introduce PolarMem, a training-free Polarized Latent Graph Memory designed to ground agent reasoning in verifiable evidence. PolarMem transforms fuzzy perceptual likelihoods into discrete logical constraints through non-parametric distributional partitioning. Furthermore, it employs a polarized graph topology with orthogonal inhibitory connections to explicitly store verified negation as a primary cognitive state. At inference time, we enforce a logic-dominant retrieval paradigm, suppressing hallucinatory patterns that violate negative constraints. Extensive evaluation across eight frozen Vision--Language Models and six benchmarks demonstrates that PolarMem functions as a robust cognitive system, establishing a foundation for verifiable multimodal agents.

We study CODI, a continuous-thought teacher-student distillation model, on strictly sequential polynomial-iteration tasks. Using logit-lens decoding, linear probes, attention analysis, and activation patching, we localize intermediate-state representations and trace their routing to the final readout. On two- and three-hop tasks, CODI forms the full set of bridge states that become decodable across latent-thought positions, while the final input follows a separate near-direct route; predictions arise via late fusion at the end-of-thought boundary. For longer hop lengths, CODI does not reliably execute a full latent rollout, instead exhibiting a partial latent reasoning path that concentrates on late intermediates and fuses them with the last input at the answer readout position. Ablations show that this partial pathway can collapse under regime shifts, including harder optimization.

We further provide a theoretical perspective showing that diversity across agents supports recovery of omitted information: although any single compressed history may discard details, aggregating multiple agents' compressed views allows the collective representation to approach the information bottleneck with exponentially high probability.", "AI": {"tldr": "DebateOCR\uff1a\u901a\u8fc7\u56fe\u50cf\u538b\u7f29\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8fa9\u8bba\u5386\u53f2\uff0c\u51cf\u5c1192%\u7684token\u4f7f\u7528\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u4fe1\u606f\u5b8c\u6574\u6027", "motivation": "\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8fa9\u8bba\u867d\u7136\u80fd\u63d0\u9ad8\u63a8\u7406\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u51cf\u5c11\u5e7b\u89c9\uff0c\u4f46\u968f\u7740\u8fa9\u8bba\u8f6e\u6b21\u548c\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6570\u91cf\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4f1a\u5feb\u901f\u589e\u957f\u3002\u4fdd\u7559\u5b8c\u6574\u7684\u6587\u672c\u5386\u53f2\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4token\u4f7f\u7528\u91cf\u8d85\u8fc7\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u901a\u5e38\u9700\u8981\u91cd\u590d\u7684\u6458\u8981\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u589e\u52a0\u4e86\u5f00\u9500\u5e76\u52a0\u5267\u4fe1\u606f\u635f\u5931\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDebateOCR\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u538b\u7f29\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u7d27\u51d1\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u8868\u793a\u66ff\u6362\u5197\u957f\u7684\u6587\u672c\u8fa9\u8bba\u8f68\u8ff9\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u901a\u8fc7\u4e13\u95e8\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5904\u7406\u8fd9\u4e9b\u56fe\u50cf\u8868\u793a\u6765\u8c03\u8282\u540e\u7eed\u8fa9\u8bba\u8f6e\u6b21\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u538b\u7f29\u4e86\u901a\u5e38\u5305\u542b\u6570\u4e07\u5230\u6570\u5341\u4e07token\u7684\u5386\u53f2\u8bb0\u5f55\u3002", "result": "\u5c06\u8f93\u5165token\u51cf\u5c11\u4e8692%\u4ee5\u4e0a\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u5e76\u52a0\u5feb\u4e86\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u3002\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u591a\u6837\u6027\u652f\u6301\u6062\u590d\u88ab\u7701\u7565\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\uff1a\u867d\u7136\u5355\u4e2a\u538b\u7f29\u5386\u53f2\u53ef\u80fd\u4e22\u5931\u7ec6\u8282\uff0c\u4f46\u805a\u5408\u591a\u4e2a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u538b\u7f29\u89c6\u56fe\u53ef\u4ee5\u4f7f\u96c6\u4f53\u8868\u793a\u4ee5\u6307\u6570\u7ea7\u9ad8\u6982\u7387\u63a5\u8fd1\u4fe1\u606f\u74f6\u9888\u3002", "conclusion": "DebateOCR\u901a\u8fc7\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u538b\u7f29\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8fa9\u8bba\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7206\u70b8\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u4fe1\u606f\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5927\u5e45\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u4e3a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

When derivatives cannot be evaluated directly, stochastic estimators can provide approximate gradients. However, these estimators' perturbation-based sampling of the objective function introduces variance that can lead to slow convergence. In this paper, we present dimensional peeking, a variance reduction method for gradient estimation in discrete optimization via simulation. By lifting the sampling granularity from scalar values to classes of values that follow the same control flow path, we increase the information gathered per simulation evaluation. Our derivation from an established smoothed gradient estimator shows that the method does not introduce any bias. We present an implementation via a custom numerical data type to transparently carry out dimensional peeking over C++ programs. Variance reductions by factors of up to 7.9 are observed for three simulation-based optimization problems with high-dimensional input. The optimization progress compared to three meta-heuristics shows that dimensional peeking increases the competitiveness of zeroth-order optimization for discrete and non-convex simulations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3a\"dimensional peeking\"\u7684\u65b9\u5dee\u7f29\u51cf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u79bb\u6563\u4eff\u771f\u4f18\u5316\u4e2d\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u91c7\u6837\u7c92\u5ea6\u4ece\u6807\u91cf\u63d0\u5347\u5230\u9075\u5faa\u76f8\u540c\u63a7\u5236\u6d41\u8def\u5f84\u7684\u503c\u7c7b\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u68af\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u65b9\u5dee\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u96f6\u9636\u4f18\u5316\u5728\u79bb\u6563\u975e\u51f8\u4eff\u771f\u4e2d\u7684\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u68af\u5ea6\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e38\u7528\u4e8e\u9ad8\u7ef4\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u5bfb\u627e\u5c40\u90e8\u6700\u4f18\u89e3\u3002\u5f53\u65e0\u6cd5\u76f4\u63a5\u8ba1\u7b97\u5bfc\u6570\u65f6\uff0c\u968f\u673a\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u53ef\u4ee5\u63d0\u4f9b\u8fd1\u4f3c\u68af\u5ea6\u3002\u4f46\u8fd9\u4e9b\u57fa\u4e8e\u6270\u52a8\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u51fd\u6570\u91c7\u6837\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u4f1a\u5f15\u5165\u65b9\u5dee\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6536\u655b\u7f13\u6162\u3002\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u79bb\u6563\u4eff\u771f\u4f18\u5316\u4e2d\uff0c\u68af\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u65b9\u5dee\u95ee\u9898\u5c24\u4e3a\u7a81\u51fa\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fadimensional peeking\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u91c7\u6837\u7c92\u5ea6\u4ece\u6807\u91cf\u503c\u63d0\u5347\u5230\u9075\u5faa\u76f8\u540c\u63a7\u5236\u6d41\u8def\u5f84\u7684\u503c\u7c7b\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u589e\u52a0\u6bcf\u6b21\u4eff\u771f\u8bc4\u4f30\u6536\u96c6\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u91cf\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ece\u5df2\u5efa\u7acb\u7684\u5e73\u6ed1\u68af\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u63a8\u5bfc\u800c\u6765\uff0c\u4e0d\u5f15\u5165\u4efb\u4f55\u504f\u5dee\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u5b9a\u4e49\u6570\u503c\u6570\u636e\u7c7b\u578b\u5728C++\u7a0b\u5e8f\u4e2d\u900f\u660e\u5730\u5b9e\u73b0dimensional peeking\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u9ad8\u7ef4\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u4eff\u771f\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\uff0c\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u65b9\u5dee\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u9ad8\u8fbe7.9\u500d\u3002\u4e0e\u4e09\u79cd\u5143\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u7b97\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0cdimensional peeking\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u96f6\u9636\u4f18\u5316\u5728\u79bb\u6563\u548c\u975e\u51f8\u4eff\u771f\u4e2d\u7684\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "Dimensional peeking\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u65b9\u5dee\u7f29\u51cf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u68af\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4f7f\u96f6\u9636\u4f18\u5316\u5728\u79bb\u6563\u975e\u51f8\u4eff\u771f\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u66f4\u5177\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u5347\u91c7\u6837\u7c92\u5ea6\u800c\u4e0d\u5f15\u5165\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u4e3a\u4eff\u771f\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u6280\u672f\u9014\u5f84\u3002"}}

FL mitigates this issue by enabling decentralized training, but practical deployments face challenges due to client heterogeneity in computational resources, application requirements, and model architectures. We argue that while replacing data with model parameters characterizes the present of FL, replacing parameters with preferences represents a more scalable and privacy-preserving future. Motivated by this perspective, we propose MoR, a federated alignment framework based on GRPO with Mixture-of-Rewards for heterogeneous VLMs. MoR initializes a visual foundation model as a KL-regularized reference, while each client locally trains a reward model from local preference annotations, capturing specific evaluation signals without exposing raw data. To reconcile heterogeneous rewards, we introduce a routing-based fusion mechanism that adaptively aggregates client reward signals. Finally, the server performs GRPO with this mixed reward to optimize the base VLM. Experiments on three public VQA benchmarks demonstrate that MoR consistently outperforms federated alignment baselines in generalization, robustness, and cross-client adaptability.

However, we identify a critical trade-off: while unconstrained RFT achieves strong reasoning performance, it severely compromises model trustworthiness by amplifying hallucination and worsening calibration; conversely, RKL-constrained RFT preserves trustworthiness but limits reasoning gains due to its unbounded penalty on exploratory deviations. To resolve this tension, we introduce CARE-RFT (Confidence-Anchored Regularized Reinforcement Finetuning), a novel method that replaces standard reverse KL regularization with a skew reverse KL divergence. CARE-RFT provides a confidence-sensitive penalty: it is bounded for confident, consistently rewarded explorations to enable reasoning, while unbounded elsewhere to preserve calibration. Extensive experiments across multiple model scales and RFT algorithms show that CARE-RFT achieves a superior balance, matching the reasoning performance of unconstrained RFT while recovering the trustworthiness and calibration of the base model. Our work establishes that careful, confidence-aware regularization is key to building both capable and trustworthy reasoning models.", "AI": {"tldr": "CARE-RFT\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5fae\u8c03\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4f7f\u7528\u504f\u659c\u53cd\u5411KL\u6563\u5ea6\u66ff\u4ee3\u6807\u51c6\u53cd\u5411KL\u6b63\u5219\u5316\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u5f3a\u5316\u5fae\u8c03\u5b58\u5728\u4e00\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u6743\u8861\uff1a\u65e0\u7ea6\u675f\u7684RFT\u80fd\u83b7\u5f97\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f46\u4f1a\u4e25\u91cd\u635f\u5bb3\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\uff08\u589e\u52a0\u5e7b\u89c9\u3001\u6076\u5316\u6821\u51c6\uff09\uff1b\u800cRKL\u7ea6\u675f\u7684RFT\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\uff0c\u4f46\u7531\u4e8e\u5bf9\u63a2\u7d22\u6027\u504f\u5dee\u7684\u65e0\u754c\u60e9\u7f5a\u800c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u63a8\u7406\u589e\u76ca\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86CARE-RFT\uff08\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u951a\u5b9a\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u5f3a\u5316\u5fae\u8c03\uff09\uff0c\u7528\u504f\u659c\u53cd\u5411KL\u6563\u5ea6\u66ff\u4ee3\u6807\u51c6\u53cd\u5411KL\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u654f\u611f\u7684\u60e9\u7f5a\uff1a\u5bf9\u4e8e\u81ea\u4fe1\u4e14\u6301\u7eed\u83b7\u5f97\u5956\u52b1\u7684\u63a2\u7d22\uff0c\u60e9\u7f5a\u662f\u6709\u754c\u7684\u4ee5\u652f\u6301\u63a8\u7406\uff1b\u5728\u5176\u4ed6\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u60e9\u7f5a\u662f\u65e0\u754c\u7684\u4ee5\u4fdd\u6301\u6821\u51c6\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u548cRFT\u7b97\u6cd5\u4e0a\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cCARE-RFT\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4f18\u8d8a\u7684\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u5339\u914d\u4e86\u65e0\u7ea6\u675fRFT\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u6062\u590d\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53ef\u4fe1\u5ea6\u548c\u6821\u51c6\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u7cbe\u5fc3\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u3001\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u662f\u6784\u5efa\u65e2\u5177\u5907\u80fd\u529b\u53c8\u53ef\u4fe1\u8d56\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5173\u952e\u3002"}}

To address this limitation, we introduce a two-phase diagnostic framework for assessing reliability of LLM-as-a-Judge, grounded in Item Response Theory (IRT). The framework adopts Graded Response Model (GRM) of IRT and formalizes reliability along two complementary dimensions: (1) intrinsic consistency, defined as the stability of measurement behavior under prompt variations, and (2) human alignment, capturing correspondence with human quality assessments. We empirically examine diverse LLM judges with this framework, and show that leveraging IRT-GRM yields interpretable signals for diagnosing judgments systematically.

We first propose a reverse engineering methodology to construct a Chain-of-Thought dataset, explicitly mapping static code features to verifiable performance evidence. This enables the model to learn the causal logic governing optimization decisions rather than merely imitating sequences. Leveraging this interpretable prior, we design a collaborative inference mechanism where the LLM functions as a strategist, defining optimization intents that dynamically guide the mutation operations of a genetic algorithm.

However, traditional ontology construction relies on manual annotation and conventional natural language processing (NLP) techniques, making the process labour-intensive and costly, especially in specialised fields like casting manufacturing.

Revisiting Game-Theoretic Reasoning with Agentic Tool Use", "comment": "Accepted by ICLR 2026", "summary": "As Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly applied in high-stakes domains, their ability to reason strategically under uncertainty becomes critical. Poker provides a rigorous testbed, requiring not only strong actions but also principled, game-theoretic reasoning. In this paper, we conduct a systematic study of LLMs in multiple realistic poker tasks, evaluating both gameplay outcomes and reasoning traces. Our analysis reveals LLMs fail to compete against traditional algorithms and identifies three recurring flaws: reliance on heuristics, factual misunderstandings, and a \"knowing-doing\" gap where actions diverge from reasoning. An initial attempt with behavior cloning and step-level reinforcement learning improves reasoning style but remains insufficient for accurate game-theoretic play. Motivated by these limitations, we propose ToolPoker, a tool-integrated reasoning framework that combines external solvers for GTO-consistent actions with more precise professional-style explanations. Experiments demonstrate that ToolPoker achieves state-of-the-art gameplay while producing reasoning traces that closely reflect game-theoretic principles.", "AI": {"tldr": "LLMs\u5728\u6251\u514b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u4f9d\u8d56\u3001\u4e8b\u5b9e\u8bef\u89e3\u548c\u77e5\u884c\u5dee\u8ddd\u4e09\u5927\u7f3a\u9677\u3002\u63d0\u51fa\u7684ToolPoker\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u5916\u90e8\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u5b9e\u73b0GTO\u4e00\u81f4\u884c\u52a8\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6e38\u620f\u8868\u73b0\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u9886\u57df\u5e94\u7528\u589e\u591a\uff0c\u5176\u5728\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4e0b\u7684\u6218\u7565\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u53d8\u5f97\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u6251\u514b\u6e38\u620f\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5e73\u53f0\uff0c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u9700\u8981\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u884c\u52a8\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u8fd8\u9700\u8981\u57fa\u4e8e\u535a\u5f08\u8bba\u7684\u539f\u5219\u6027\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "method": "\u9996\u5148\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30LLMs\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u73b0\u5b9e\u6251\u514b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5176\u63a8\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\u3002\u7136\u540e\u63d0\u51faToolPoker\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u6574\u5408\u5916\u90e8\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\u751f\u6210GTO\u4e00\u81f4\u884c\u52a8\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u4e13\u4e1a\u98ce\u683c\u89e3\u91ca\u3002", "result": "LLMs\u65e0\u6cd5\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u7b97\u6cd5\u7ade\u4e89\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u4e09\u5927\u7f3a\u9677\uff1a\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u4f9d\u8d56\u3001\u4e8b\u5b9e\u8bef\u89e3\u3001\u77e5\u884c\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002ToolPoker\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6e38\u620f\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\u66f4\u8d34\u8fd1\u535a\u5f08\u8bba\u539f\u5219\u3002", "conclusion": "LLMs\u5728\u6251\u514b\u7b49\u9700\u8981\u535a\u5f08\u8bba\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u7f3a\u9677\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u5916\u90e8\u5de5\u5177\u548c\u6c42\u89e3\u5668\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5176\u6218\u7565\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u884c\u52a8\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u9886\u57df\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

In this paper, we propose the Symbolic Transition Mechanism (STM) a novel framework that bridges numeric time series data and language models through symbolic abstraction and prompt engineering. STM transforms continuous time series values into symbol tokens with quantization techniques based on human cognitive structures, and captures temporal dynamics through structured transformations of symbols, enabling fast engineering based predictions in which language models focus on critical parts of time series data. STM is a general purpose mechanisms that ensure the integrity of backbone language models, but they significantly improve their efficiency by inferring the dynamic and structured patterns inherent in time series data. We evaluated STM on various time series datasets, paired with four small language models (SLM) with limited computational environments. For all models, STM achieves error reductions of up to 69% in MAE and 90% in MSE compared to the default backbone SLM without STM. These results demonstrate the potential of STM as an efficient, adaptable layer for symbol-driven time series prediction using foundation models. The accuracy improvements were made at negligible resource costs, with maximum GPU memory of the base model increasing by approximately 0.06% and latency overhead increasing by only 0.64%.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u7b26\u53f7\u8f6c\u6362\u673a\u5236\uff08STM\uff09\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7b26\u53f7\u62bd\u8c61\u548c\u63d0\u793a\u5de5\u7a0b\u5c06\u6570\u503c\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u6570\u636e\u4e0e\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8fde\u63a5\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9aa8\u5e72\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5de8\u5927\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u9700\u6c42\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5728\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u5e73\u53f0\u4e0a\u7684\u90e8\u7f72\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5927\u5e45\u964d\u4f4e\u8d44\u6e90\u6d88\u8017\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7b26\u53f7\u8f6c\u6362\u673a\u5236\uff08STM\uff09\uff0c\u5c06\u8fde\u7eed\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u503c\u901a\u8fc7\u57fa\u4e8e\u4eba\u7c7b\u8ba4\u77e5\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u91cf\u5316\u6280\u672f\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u7b26\u53f7\u6807\u8bb0\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u7b26\u53f7\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u8f6c\u6362\u6355\u6349\u65f6\u95f4\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u4f7f\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u4e13\u6ce8\u4e8e\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u6570\u636e\u7684\u5173\u952e\u90e8\u5206\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u56db\u4e2a\u5c0f\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0cSTM\u76f8\u6bd4\u9ed8\u8ba4\u9aa8\u5e72SLM\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86MAE\u8bef\u5dee\u964d\u4f4e\u9ad8\u8fbe69%\uff0cMSE\u8bef\u5dee\u964d\u4f4e\u9ad8\u8fbe90%\u3002\u8d44\u6e90\u5f00\u9500\u6781\u4f4e\uff0cGPU\u5185\u5b58\u4ec5\u589e\u52a0\u7ea60.06%\uff0c\u5ef6\u8fdf\u5f00\u9500\u4ec5\u589e\u52a00.64%\u3002", "conclusion": "STM\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u53ef\u9002\u5e94\u7684\u7b26\u53f7\u9a71\u52a8\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u5c42\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9aa8\u5e72\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7b26\u53f7\u62bd\u8c61\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u9884\u6d4b\u6548\u7387\u548c\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u5e73\u53f0\u4e0a\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u884c\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Our method leverages atomic concept edits (ACEs), which are targeted operations that add, remove, or replace an interpretable concept in the input prompt. By systematically applying ACEs and observing the resulting effects on model behavior across various tasks, our framework learns a causal mapping from edits to predictable outcomes. This learned constitution provides deep, generalizable insights into the model. Empirically, we validate our approach across diverse tasks, including mathematical reasoning and text-to-image alignment, for controlling and understanding model behavior. We found that for text-to-image generation, GPT-Image tends to focus on grammatical adherence, while Imagen 4 prioritizes atmospheric coherence. In mathematical reasoning, distractor variables confuse GPT-5 but leave Gemini 2.5 models and o4-mini largely unaffected.

However, extracting consistent and fine-grained change information from historical map series remains challenging due to spatial misalignment, cartographic variation, and degrading document quality, limiting most analyses to small-scale or qualitative approaches. We propose a fully automated, deep learning-based framework for fine-grained urban change analysis from large collections of historical maps, built on a modular design that integrates dense map alignment, multi-temporal object detection, and change profiling. This framework shifts the analysis of historical maps from ad hoc visual comparison toward systematic, quantitative characterization of urban change. Experiments demonstrate the robust performance of the proposed alignment and object detection methods. Applied to Paris between 1868 and 1937, the framework reveals the spatial and temporal heterogeneity in urban transformation, highlighting its relevance for research in the social sciences and humanities. The modular design of our framework further supports adaptation to diverse cartographic contexts and downstream applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4ece\u5386\u53f2\u5730\u56fe\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u57ce\u5e02\u53d8\u5316\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u5df4\u9ece1868-1937\u5e74\u7684\u57ce\u5e02\u8f6c\u578b\u5206\u6790", "motivation": "\u5386\u53f2\u5730\u56fe\u8bb0\u5f55\u4e86\u57ce\u5e02\u957f\u671f\u8f6c\u578b\uff0c\u4f46\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u53d7\u7a7a\u95f4\u9519\u4f4d\u3001\u5236\u56fe\u5dee\u5f02\u548c\u6587\u6863\u8d28\u91cf\u9000\u5316\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u8fdb\u884c\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u3001\u5b9a\u91cf\u5206\u6790", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u96c6\u6210\u5bc6\u96c6\u5730\u56fe\u5bf9\u9f50\u3001\u591a\u65f6\u76f8\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u53d8\u5316\u5206\u6790\u4e09\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u6a21\u5757", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u5df4\u9ece\u6848\u4f8b\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u57ce\u5e02\u8f6c\u578b\u7684\u7a7a\u95f4\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u5f02\u8d28\u6027", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5c06\u5386\u53f2\u5730\u56fe\u5206\u6790\u4ece\u4e34\u65f6\u89c6\u89c9\u6bd4\u8f83\u8f6c\u5411\u7cfb\u7edf\u5b9a\u91cf\u8868\u5f81\uff0c\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u8bbe\u8ba1\u652f\u6301\u9002\u5e94\u4e0d\u540c\u5236\u56fe\u80cc\u666f\u548c\u4e0b\u6e38\u5e94\u7528"}}

This saturation largely stems from the dominance of template-based computation and shallow arithmetic decomposition in existing datasets, which underrepresent reasoning skills such as multi-constraint coordination, constructive logical synthesis, and spatial inference. To address this gap, we introduce ReasoningMath-Plus, a benchmark of 150 carefully curated problems explicitly designed to evaluate structural reasoning. Each problem emphasizes reasoning under interacting constraints, constructive solution formation, or non-trivial structural insight, and is annotated with a minimal reasoning skeleton to support fine-grained process-level evaluation. Alongside the dataset, we introduce HCRS (Hazard-aware Chain-based Rule Score), a deterministic step-level scoring function, and train a Process Reward Model (PRM) on the annotated reasoning traces. Empirically, while leading models attain relatively high final-answer accuracy (up to 5.8/10), HCRS-based holistic evaluation yields substantially lower scores (average 4.36/10, best 5.14/10), showing that answer-only metrics can overestimate reasoning robustness.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86ReasoningMath-Plus\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u5305\u542b150\u4e2a\u7cbe\u5fc3\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e13\u6ce8\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u7ed3\u6784\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165HCRS\u8bc4\u5206\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u73b0\u6709LLMs\u5728\u6df1\u5c42\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u4e0a\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5df2\u8fbe\u5230\u63a5\u8fd1\u9971\u548c\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u4e3b\u8981\u6e90\u4e8e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d\u7684\u6a21\u677f\u5316\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u6d45\u5c42\u7b97\u672f\u5206\u89e3\uff0c\u672a\u80fd\u771f\u6b63\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u7ea6\u675f\u534f\u8c03\u3001\u6784\u9020\u6027\u903b\u8f91\u5408\u6210\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u7b49\u6838\u5fc3\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u521b\u5efaReasoningMath-Plus\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u5305\u542b150\u4e2a\u5f3a\u8c03\u4ea4\u4e92\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u6784\u9020\u6027\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u5f62\u6210\u548c\u975e\u5e73\u51e1\u7ed3\u6784\u6d1e\u5bdf\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff1b\u5f15\u5165HCRS\uff08\u5371\u9669\u611f\u77e5\u94fe\u5f0f\u89c4\u5219\u8bc4\u5206\uff09\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u6b65\u9aa4\u7ea7\u8bc4\u5206\u51fd\u6570\uff1b\u57fa\u4e8e\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u9886\u5148\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6700\u7ec8\u7b54\u6848\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0a\u76f8\u5bf9\u8f83\u9ad8\uff08\u6700\u9ad85.8/10\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u57fa\u4e8eHCRS\u7684\u6574\u4f53\u8bc4\u4f30\u5f97\u5206\u663e\u8457\u8f83\u4f4e\uff08\u5e73\u57474.36/10\uff0c\u6700\u4f735.14/10\uff09\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u4ec5\u57fa\u4e8e\u7b54\u6848\u7684\u6307\u6807\u4f1a\u9ad8\u4f30\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u7a33\u5065\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9700\u8981\u8d85\u8d8a\u7b80\u5355\u7b54\u6848\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u771f\u6b63\u8861\u91cf\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0cReasoningMath-Plus\u57fa\u51c6\u548cHCRS\u8bc4\u5206\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7ea7\u8bc4\u4f30\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6df1\u5c42\u7ed3\u6784\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002"}}

Two dominant notions of fairness have emerged in the literature: Group Fairness (GF), which focuses on mitigating disparities across demographic subpopulations, and Individual Fairness (IF), which emphasizes consistent treatment of similar individuals. These notions have traditionally been studied in isolation. In contrast, this survey examines methods that jointly address GF and IF, integrating both perspectives within unified frameworks and explicitly characterizing the trade-offs between them. We provide a systematic and critical review of hybrid fairness approaches, organizing existing methods according to the fairness mechanisms they employ and the algorithmic and mathematical strategies used to reconcile multiple fairness criteria. For each class of methods, we examine their theoretical foundations, optimization mechanisms, and empirical evaluation practices, and discuss their limitations. Additionally, we discuss the challenges and identify open research directions for developing principled, context-aware hybrid fairness methods. By synthesizing insights across the literature, this survey aims to serve as a comprehensive resource for researchers and practitioners seeking to design hybrid algorithms that provide reliable fairness guarantees at both the individual and group levels.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8fd9\u7bc7\u7efc\u8ff0\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5730\u56de\u987e\u4e86\u540c\u65f6\u5904\u7406\u7fa4\u4f53\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u548c\u4e2a\u4f53\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\u4e0b\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u6743\u8861\u4e0e\u6574\u5408\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u7814\u7a76\u901a\u5e38\u5b64\u7acb\u5730\u5904\u7406\u7fa4\u4f53\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u548c\u4e2a\u4f53\u516c\u5e73\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u51b3\u7b56\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u540c\u65f6\u8003\u8651\u8fd9\u4e24\u79cd\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u89c6\u89d2\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u4e3a\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u5458\u548c\u4ece\u4e1a\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u8bc1\u4e2a\u4f53\u548c\u7fa4\u4f53\u5c42\u9762\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u5168\u9762\u8d44\u6e90\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u6587\u732e\u7efc\u8ff0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5bf9\u6df7\u5408\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u5206\u7c7b\u6574\u7406\uff0c\u6309\u7167\u91c7\u7528\u7684\u516c\u5e73\u673a\u5236\u3001\u7b97\u6cd5\u548c\u6570\u5b66\u7b56\u7565\u6765\u7ec4\u7ec7\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u5bf9\u6bcf\u7c7b\u65b9\u6cd5\u5206\u6790\u5176\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u3001\u4f18\u5316\u673a\u5236\u548c\u5b9e\u8bc1\u8bc4\u4f30\u5b9e\u8df5\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6df7\u5408\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u7c7b\u548c\u5206\u6790\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u9610\u660e\u4e86\u7fa4\u4f53\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u4e0e\u4e2a\u4f53\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6743\u8861\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6df7\u5408\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bf9\u4e8e\u8bbe\u8ba1\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u7cfb\u7edf\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u52a0\u539f\u5219\u5316\u3001\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u672c\u6587\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u6307\u660e\u4e86\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5f00\u53d1\u80fd\u591f\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u8bc1\u4e2a\u4f53\u548c\u7fa4\u4f53\u5c42\u9762\u516c\u5e73\u6027\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

We introduce BELLA (Budget-Efficient LLM Selection via Automated skill-profiling), a framework that recommends optimal LLM selection for tasks through interpretable skill-based model selection. Standard benchmarks report aggregate metrics that obscure which specific capabilities a task requires and whether a cheaper model could suffice. BELLA addresses this gap through three stages: (1) decomposing LLM outputs and extract the granular skills required by using critic-based profiling, (2) clustering skills into structured capability matrices, and (3) multi-objective optimization to select the right models to maximize performance while respecting budget constraints. BELLA provides natural-language rationale for recommendations, providing transparency that current black-box routing systems lack. We describe the framework architecture, situate it within the landscape of LLM routing and evaluation, and discuss its application to financial reasoning as a representative domain exhibiting diverse skill requirements and cost-variation across models.

While CoT helps LLMs and VLMs articulate intermediate steps, its text-only form often fails on vision-intensive problems where key intermediate states are inherently visual. We introduce modal-mixed CoT, which interleaves textual tokens with compact visual sketches represented as latent embeddings. To bridge the modality gap without eroding the original knowledge and capability of the VLM, we use the VLM itself as an encoder and train the language backbone to reconstruct its own intermediate vision embeddings, to guarantee the semantic alignment of the visual latent space. We further attach a diffusion-based latent decoder, invoked by a special control token and conditioned on hidden states from the VLM. In this way, the diffusion head carries fine-grained perceptual details while the VLM specifies high-level intent, which cleanly disentangles roles and reduces the optimization pressure of the VLM. Training proceeds in two stages: supervised fine-tuning on traces that interleave text and latents with a joint next-token and latent-reconstruction objective, followed by reinforcement learning that teaches when to switch modalities and how to compose long reasoning chains. Extensive experiments across 11 diverse multimodal reasoning tasks, demonstrate that our method yields better performance than language-only and other CoT methods.

An extended and pedagogical version will appear as a book chapter", "summary": "Mortgage default prediction is a core task in financial risk management, and machine learning models are increasingly used to estimate default probabilities and provide interpretable signals for downstream decisions. In real-world mortgage datasets, however, three factors frequently undermine evaluation validity and deployment reliability: ambiguity in default labeling, severe class imbalance, and information leakage arising from temporal structure and post-event variables. We compare multiple machine learning approaches for mortgage default prediction using a real-world loan-level dataset, with emphasis on leakage control and imbalance handling.

However, existing approaches are fundamentally constrained by the ``Memory Wall,'' restricting practical deployments to low resolutions (e.g., $64 \\times 64$). This paper bridges the gap between generative models and high-resolution neural simulations by introducing a scalable \\textit{Hardware-Algorithm Co-Design} framework. We identify that high-resolution generation suffers from a critical resource mismatch: the World Model is compute-bound while the Decoder is memory-bound. To address this, we propose a heterogeneous architecture that intelligently decouples these components across a cluster of AI accelerators. Our system features three core innovations: (1) an asymmetric resource allocation strategy that optimizes throughput under sequence parallelism constraints; (2) a memory-centric operator fusion scheme that minimizes off-chip bandwidth usage; and (3) a manifold-aware latent extrapolation mechanism that exploits temporal redundancy to mask latency. We validate our approach on a cluster of programmable AI accelerators, enabling real-time generation at $720 \\times 480$ resolution -- a $50\\times$ increase in pixel throughput over prior baselines. Evaluated on both continuous 3D racing and discrete 2D platformer benchmarks, our system delivers fluid 26.4 FPS and 48.3 FPS respectively, with an amortized effective latency of 2.7 ms.

Inference-time ensemble methods can improve performance by sampling diverse reasoning paths or aggregating multiple candidate answers, but they typically treat candidates independently and provide no formal guarantees that ensembling improves reasoning quality. We propose a novel method, Aligned Delegation for Multi-Agent LLM Reasoning (ALIGN), which formulates LLM reasoning as an aligned delegation game. In ALIGN, a principal delegates a task to multiple agents that generate candidate solutions under designed incentives, and then selects among their outputs to produce a final answer. This formulation induces structured interaction among agents while preserving alignment between agent and principal objectives. We establish theoretical guarantees showing that, under a fair comparison with equal access to candidate solutions, ALIGN provably improves expected performance over single-agent generation. Our analysis accommodates correlated candidate answers and relaxes independence assumptions that are commonly used in prior work.

While classical AI-based methods have been developed for early diagnosis and stage classification of AD, growing data volumes and limited computational resources necessitate faster, more efficient approaches. Quantum-based AI methods, which leverage superposition and entanglement principles along with high-dimensional Hilbert space, can surpass classical approaches' limitations and offer higher accuracy for high-dimensional, heterogeneous, and noisy data. In this study, a Quantum-Based Parallel Model (QBPM) architecture is proposed for the efficient classification of AD stages using MRI datasets, inspired by the principles of classical model parallelism. The proposed model leverages quantum advantages by employing two distinct quantum circuits, each incorporating rotational and entanglement blocks, running in parallel on the same quantum simulator. The classification performance of the model was evaluated on two different datasets to assess its overall robustness and generalization capability. The proposed model demonstrated high classification accuracy across both datasets, highlighting its overall robustness and generalization capability. Results obtained under high-level Gaussian noise, simulating real-world conditions, further provided experimental evidence for the model's applicability not only in theoretical but also in practical scenarios. Moreover, compared with five different classical transfer learning methods, the proposed model demonstrated its efficiency as an alternative to classical approaches by achieving higher classification accuracy and comparable execution time while utilizing fewer circuit parameters. The results indicate that the proposed QBPM architecture represents an innovative and powerful approach for the classification of stages in complex diseases such as Alzheimer's.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u91cf\u5b50\u7684\u5e76\u884c\u6a21\u578b\uff08QBPM\uff09\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4f7f\u7528MRI\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u9ad8\u6548\u5206\u7c7b\u963f\u5c14\u8328\u6d77\u9ed8\u75c5\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u5229\u7528\u91cf\u5b50\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u5728\u91cf\u5b50\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u4e0a\u5e76\u884c\u8fd0\u884c\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u7535\u8def\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u5206\u7c7b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u826f\u597d\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u9884\u671f\u5bff\u547d\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u963f\u5c14\u8328\u6d77\u9ed8\u75c5\uff08AD\uff09\u5df2\u6210\u4e3a\u5168\u7403\u4e3b\u8981\u5065\u5eb7\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u4f20\u7edfAI\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728AD\u65e9\u671f\u8bca\u65ad\u548c\u9636\u6bb5\u5206\u7c7b\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u6570\u636e\u91cf\u589e\u957f\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u6709\u9650\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u5feb\u3001\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u91cf\u5b50AI\u65b9\u6cd5\u5229\u7528\u53e0\u52a0\u548c\u7ea0\u7f20\u539f\u7406\u4ee5\u53ca\u9ad8\u7ef4\u5e0c\u5c14\u4f2f\u7279\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u8d85\u8d8a\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u7ef4\u3001\u5f02\u6784\u548c\u566a\u58f0\u6570\u636e\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u9ad8\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u91cf\u5b50\u57fa\u5e76\u884c\u6a21\u578b\uff08QBPM\uff09\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u53d7\u7ecf\u5178\u6a21\u578b\u5e76\u884c\u539f\u7406\u542f\u53d1\u3002\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u5229\u7528\u91cf\u5b50\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u91cf\u5b50\u7535\u8def\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e2a\u7535\u8def\u5305\u542b\u65cb\u8f6c\u548c\u7ea0\u7f20\u5757\uff0c\u5728\u540c\u4e00\u4e2a\u91cf\u5b50\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u4e0a\u5e76\u884c\u8fd0\u884c\u3002\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u4ee5\u6d4b\u8bd5\u5176\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u90fd\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u9ad8\u5206\u7c7b\u7cbe\u5ea6\uff0c\u663e\u793a\u4e86\u5176\u6574\u4f53\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u5728\u9ad8\u65af\u566a\u58f0\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff08\u6a21\u62df\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\uff09\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u4e0d\u4ec5\u5728\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\uff0c\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u4e5f\u5177\u6709\u9002\u7528\u6027\u3002\u4e0e\u4e94\u79cd\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u7ecf\u5178\u8fc1\u79fb\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0c\u8be5\u6a21\u578b\u4f7f\u7528\u66f4\u5c11\u7684\u7535\u8def\u53c2\u6570\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u53ef\u6bd4\u7684\u6267\u884c\u65f6\u95f4\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684QBPM\u67b6\u6784\u4ee3\u8868\u4e86\u5206\u7c7b\u590d\u6742\u75be\u75c5\uff08\u5982\u963f\u5c14\u8328\u6d77\u9ed8\u75c5\uff09\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u521b\u65b0\u4e14\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u91cf\u5b50\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u533b\u5b66\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u6790\u4e2d\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u91cf\u5b50\u8ba1\u7b97\u5728\u533b\u7597\u8bca\u65ad\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

CodePilot performs hierarchical fault localization from repository to file and function level, explores diverse patch trajectories using MCTS, and leverages execution feedback as a reward signal to guide search and refinement. The framework further incorporates confidence-calibrated generation to selectively refine low-confidence outputs.

Most plants rely on scheduled preventive maintenance, since existing predictive maintenance models, often based on opaque machine learning methods, lack interpretability and operator trust. This study proposes an explainable prognostic framework for UF membrane remaining useful life (RUL) estimation using fuzzy similarity reasoning. A physics-informed Health Index, derived from transmembrane pressure, flux, and resistance, captures degradation dynamics, which are then fuzzified via Gaussian membership functions. Using a similarity measure, the model identifies historical degradation trajectories resembling the current state and formulates RUL predictions as Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy rules.

Beyond analysis, probes are often used operationally in probe-then-steer pipelines: a learned concept vector is extracted from a probe and injected via additive activation steering by adding it to a layer representation during the forward pass. The effectiveness of this pipeline hinges on estimating concept vectors that are accurate, directionally stable under ablation, and inexpensive to obtain. Motivated by these desiderata, we propose RAPTOR (Ridge-Adaptive Logistic Probe), a simple L2-regularized logistic probe whose validation-tuned ridge strength yields concept vectors from normalized weights. Across extensive experiments on instruction-tuned LLMs and human-written concept datasets, RAPTOR matches or exceeds strong baselines in accuracy while achieving competitive directional stability and substantially lower training cost; these quantitative results are supported by qualitative downstream steering demonstrations. Finally, using the Convex Gaussian Min-max Theorem (CGMT), we provide a mechanistic characterization of ridge logistic regression in an idealized Gaussian teacher-student model in the high-dimensional few-shot regime, explaining how penalty strength mediates probe accuracy and concept-vector stability and yielding structural predictions that qualitatively align with trends observed on real LLM embeddings.", "AI": {"tldr": "RAPTOR\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eL2\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u903b\u8f91\u56de\u5f52\u7684\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u63a2\u9488\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4ece\u51bb\u7ed3LLM\u7684\u5c42\u8868\u793a\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u6982\u5ff5\u5411\u91cf\uff0c\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3001\u65b9\u5411\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u6210\u672c\u65b9\u9762\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u63a2\u9488\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u63a2\u9488-\u5f15\u5bfc\u6d41\u7a0b\u4e2d\u9700\u8981\u51c6\u786e\u3001\u65b9\u5411\u7a33\u5b9a\u4e14\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u5411\u91cf\u4f30\u8ba1\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8fd9\u4e9b\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faRAPTOR\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528L2\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u7684\u903b\u8f91\u56de\u5f52\u63a2\u9488\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9a8c\u8bc1\u96c6\u8c03\u4f18\u7684\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u5f3a\u5ea6\uff0c\u4ece\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u6743\u91cd\u4e2d\u63d0\u53d6\u6982\u5ff5\u5411\u91cf\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6307\u4ee4\u8c03\u4f18LLM\u548c\u4eba\u5de5\u7f16\u5199\u6982\u5ff5\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cRAPTOR\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0a\u5339\u914d\u6216\u8d85\u8d8a\u5f3a\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u83b7\u5f97\u7ade\u4e89\u6027\u7684\u65b9\u5411\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u663e\u8457\u66f4\u4f4e\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6210\u672c\u3002", "conclusion": "RAPTOR\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7b80\u5355\u6709\u6548\u7684\u63a2\u9488\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u51f8\u9ad8\u65af\u6700\u5c0f\u6700\u5927\u5b9a\u7406\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u89e3\u91ca\u4e86\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u5f3a\u5ea6\u5982\u4f55\u8c03\u8282\u63a2\u9488\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u6982\u5ff5\u5411\u91cf\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7406\u8bba\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9eLLM\u5d4c\u5165\u7684\u89c2\u5bdf\u8d8b\u52bf\u4e00\u81f4\u3002"}}

Despite remarkable progress across domains ranging from pattern recognition to intelligent decision-making in recent decades, exemplified by breakthroughs in board games, card games, and electronic sports games, there remains a pressing need for more challenging benchmarks to drive further research. To this end, this paper proposes OpenGuanDan, a novel benchmark that enables both efficient simulation of GuanDan (a popular four-player, multi-round Chinese card game) and comprehensive evaluation of both learning-based and rule-based GuanDan AI agents. OpenGuanDan poses a suite of nontrivial challenges, including imperfect information, large-scale information set and action spaces, a mixed learning objective involving cooperation and competition, long-horizon decision-making, variable action spaces, and dynamic team composition. These characteristics make it a demanding testbed for existing intelligent decision-making methods. Moreover, the independent API for each player allows human-AI interactions and supports integration with large language models. Empirically, we conduct two types of evaluations: (1) pairwise competitions among all GuanDan AI agents, and (2) human-AI matchups. Experimental results demonstrate that while current learning-based agents substantially outperform rule-based counterparts, they still fall short of achieving superhuman performance, underscoring the need for continued research in multi-agent intelligent decision-making domain.

Unlearning partially disrupts the mapping between linguistic symbols and the underlying knowledge, which remains intact as dormant memories. We find that the distributional discrepancy in the denoising process serves as a measurable indicator of how much of the mapping is retained, also reflecting the strength of unlearning. Inspired by this, we propose IVO (Initial Latent Variable Optimization), a concise and powerful attack framework that reactivates these dormant memories by reconstructing the broken mappings. Through Image Inversion}, Adversarial Optimization and Reused Attack, IVO optimizes initial latent variables to realign the noise distribution of unlearned models with their original unsafe states.

Standard uniform quantizers assume that parameters are evenly distributed, an assumption at odds with the highly skewed distributions observed in practice. We propose Benford-Quant, a simple, data-free non-uniform quantizer inspired by Benford's Law, which predicts that leading digits follow a logarithmic distribution. Benford-Quant replaces the uniform grid with a log-spaced codebook, dedicating more resolution to the frequent small-magnitude weights. We provide both theoretical intuition and empirical evidence: (i) weights in transformer transformational layers adhere closely to Benford statistics, while normalization layers systematically deviate; (ii) on Small Language Models (SLMs), Benford-Quant consistently improves perplexity, reducing 4-bit perplexity on Gemma-270M by more than 10%; and (iii) on larger LLMs, it remains competitive, with differences explained by over-parameterization effects. Our results indicate that incorporating a Benford-inspired prior into quantization grids is a low-cost modification that yields accuracy gains in aggressive few-bit regimes. Although it is not able to surpass the state of the art in tasks such as perplexity and LAMBADA, the Benford-Quant approach can be hybridized with other quantization methods-such as SmoothQuant and Activation-Aware Quantization-without major pipeline modification, potentially improving their performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "Benford-Quant\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u53d7\u672c\u798f\u7279\u5b9a\u5f8b\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u975e\u5747\u5300\u91cf\u5316\u5668\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5bf9\u6570\u95f4\u9694\u7801\u672c\u4e3a\u5c0f\u5e45\u5ea6\u6743\u91cd\u5206\u914d\u66f4\u591a\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\uff0c\u5728\u4f4e\u6bd4\u7279\u91cf\u5316\u4e2d\u63d0\u5347\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5feb\u901f\u589e\u957f\u9700\u8981\u6709\u6548\u538b\u7f29\uff0c\u6807\u51c6\u5747\u5300\u91cf\u5316\u5668\u5047\u8bbe\u53c2\u6570\u5747\u5300\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u4f46\u5b9e\u9645\u6743\u91cd\u5206\u5e03\u9ad8\u5ea6\u504f\u659c\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u66f4\u9002\u5408\u5b9e\u9645\u5206\u5e03\u7684\u975e\u5747\u5300\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faBenford-Quant\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u7b80\u5355\u3001\u65e0\u9700\u6570\u636e\u7684\u975e\u5747\u5300\u91cf\u5316\u5668\uff0c\u7528\u5bf9\u6570\u95f4\u9694\u7801\u672c\u66ff\u4ee3\u5747\u5300\u7f51\u683c\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u672c\u798f\u7279\u5b9a\u5f8b\u4e3a\u9891\u7e41\u51fa\u73b0\u7684\u5c0f\u5e45\u5ea6\u6743\u91cd\u5206\u914d\u66f4\u591a\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u3002", "result": "1) \u53d8\u6362\u5668\u53d8\u6362\u5c42\u6743\u91cd\u7b26\u5408\u672c\u798f\u5fb7\u7edf\u8ba1\uff0c\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u5c42\u7cfb\u7edf\u504f\u79bb\uff1b2) \u5728\u5c0f\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\uff0cBenford-Quant\u6301\u7eed\u6539\u5584\u56f0\u60d1\u5ea6\uff0c\u5728Gemma-270M\u4e0a4\u6bd4\u7279\u56f0\u60d1\u5ea6\u964d\u4f4e\u8d8510%\uff1b3) \u5728\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u4fdd\u6301\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\uff0c\u5dee\u5f02\u7531\u8fc7\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u6548\u5e94\u89e3\u91ca\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c06\u672c\u798f\u5fb7\u5148\u9a8c\u878d\u5165\u91cf\u5316\u7f51\u683c\u662f\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u4fee\u6539\uff0c\u5728\u6fc0\u8fdb\u4f4e\u6bd4\u7279\u91cf\u5316\u4e2d\u5e26\u6765\u7cbe\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u3002\u867d\u7136\u65e0\u6cd5\u5728\u56f0\u60d1\u5ea6\u548cLAMBADA\u7b49\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8d85\u8d8aSOTA\uff0c\u4f46\u53ef\u4e0eSmoothQuant\u3001\u6fc0\u6d3b\u611f\u77e5\u91cf\u5316\u7b49\u65b9\u6cd5\u6df7\u5408\u4f7f\u7528\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u91cd\u5927\u6d41\u7a0b\u4fee\u6539\u5373\u53ef\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

To mitigate these risks, current alignment strategies predominantly rely on heavy post-training paradigms or external interventions. However, these approaches are often computationally intensive and fail to address the inherent awareness-compliance gap, a critical misalignment where models recognize potential risks yet prioritize following user instructions due to their sycophantic tendencies. To address these limitations, we propose Self-Guard, a lightweight safety defense framework that reinforces safety compliance at the representational level. Self-Guard operates through two principal stages: (1) safety-oriented prompting, which activates the model's latent safety awareness to evoke spontaneous reflection, and (2) safety activation steering, which extracts the resulting directional shift in the hidden state space and amplifies it to ensure that safety compliance prevails over sycophancy during inference. Experiments demonstrate that Self-Guard effectively bridges the awareness-compliance gap, achieving robust safety performance without compromising model utility. Furthermore, Self-Guard exhibits strong generalization across diverse unseen risks and varying model scales, offering a cost-efficient solution for LRM safety alignment.", "AI": {"tldr": "Self-Guard\uff1a\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u5b89\u5168\u9632\u5fa1\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b89\u5168\u5bfc\u5411\u63d0\u793a\u548c\u5b89\u5168\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5f15\u5bfc\u6765\u5f25\u5408\u5927\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u610f\u8bc6-\u5408\u89c4\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5927\u91cf\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u5373\u53ef\u589e\u5f3a\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u63a8\u7406\u6a21\u578b\uff08LRMs\uff09\u5728\u663e\u5f0f\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u9762\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u4f46\u5e26\u6765\u4e86\u63a8\u7406\u64cd\u7eb5\u548c\u4fe1\u606f\u6cc4\u9732\u7b49\u72ec\u7279\u98ce\u9669\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u7b56\u7565\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u7e41\u91cd\u7684\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u8303\u5f0f\u6216\u5916\u90e8\u5e72\u9884\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u65b9\u6cd5\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff0c\u4e14\u672a\u80fd\u89e3\u51b3\u6a21\u578b\u610f\u8bc6-\u5408\u89c4\u5dee\u8ddd\u95ee\u9898\u2014\u2014\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u8bc6\u522b\u98ce\u9669\u4f46\u56e0\u5176\u5949\u627f\u503e\u5411\u800c\u4f18\u5148\u9075\u5faa\u7528\u6237\u6307\u4ee4\u3002", "method": "Self-Guard\u6846\u67b6\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e3b\u8981\u9636\u6bb5\uff1a1\uff09\u5b89\u5168\u5bfc\u5411\u63d0\u793a\uff1a\u6fc0\u6d3b\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u610f\u8bc6\u4ee5\u5f15\u53d1\u81ea\u53d1\u53cd\u601d\uff1b2\uff09\u5b89\u5168\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5f15\u5bfc\uff1a\u63d0\u53d6\u9690\u85cf\u72b6\u6001\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u65b9\u5411\u6027\u53d8\u5316\u5e76\u653e\u5927\u5b83\uff0c\u786e\u4fdd\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5b89\u5168\u5408\u89c4\u6027\u4f18\u5148\u4e8e\u5949\u627f\u503e\u5411\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660eSelf-Guard\u6709\u6548\u5f25\u5408\u4e86\u610f\u8bc6-\u5408\u89c4\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u635f\u5bb3\u6a21\u578b\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u6b64\u5916\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u672a\u89c1\u98ce\u9669\u548c\u4e0d\u540c\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u826f\u597d\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "Self-Guard\u4e3aLRM\u5b89\u5168\u5bf9\u9f50\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u7684\u8868\u793a\u5c42\u9762\u5b89\u5168\u5f3a\u5316\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u5bc6\u96c6\u6027\u548c\u610f\u8bc6-\u5408\u89c4\u5dee\u8ddd\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

Regulating cloud assistance during continual learning is challenging, as naive reward-based reinforcement learning often yields unstable offloading behavior and exacerbates catastrophic forgetting as task distributions shift. We propose DA-GRPO, a dual-advantage extension of Group Relative Policy Optimization that incorporates cloud-usage constraints directly into advantage computation, avoiding fixed reward shaping and external routing models. This design enables the local model to jointly learn task competence and collaboration behavior, allowing cloud requests to emerge naturally during post-training while respecting a prescribed assistance budget. Experiments on mathematical reasoning and code generation benchmarks show that DA-GRPO improves post-switch accuracy, substantially reduces forgetting, and maintains stable cloud usage compared to prior collaborative and routing-based approaches.", "AI": {"tldr": "DA-GRPO\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u53cc\u4f18\u52bf\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u7ec4\u76f8\u5bf9\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u4e91\u4f7f\u7528\u7ea6\u675f\u76f4\u63a5\u7eb3\u5165\u4f18\u52bf\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u4f7f\u672c\u5730\u5c0f\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u8054\u5408\u5b66\u4e60\u4efb\u52a1\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u534f\u4f5c\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5728\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u4e91\u8f85\u52a9\u8c03\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u672c\u5730\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u5c0f\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u9700\u8981\u5728\u4e25\u683c\u7684\u5185\u5b58\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u6301\u7eed\u652f\u6301\u591a\u6837\u5316\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u4e0d\u53ef\u907f\u514d\u5730\u9700\u8981\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u5730\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e91\u7aef\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0c\u5728\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u8c03\u8282\u4e91\u8f85\u52a9\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u57fa\u4e8e\u5956\u52b1\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u901a\u5e38\u4f1a\u4ea7\u751f\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u5378\u8f7d\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u5e03\u53d8\u5316\u65f6\u52a0\u5267\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDA-GRPO\uff08\u53cc\u4f18\u52bf\u7ec4\u76f8\u5bf9\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\uff09\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u7ec4\u76f8\u5bf9\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u6269\u5c55\uff0c\u5c06\u4e91\u4f7f\u7528\u7ea6\u675f\u76f4\u63a5\u7eb3\u5165\u4f18\u52bf\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u56fa\u5b9a\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u5851\u9020\u548c\u5916\u90e8\u8def\u7531\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4f7f\u672c\u5730\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u8054\u5408\u5b66\u4e60\u4efb\u52a1\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u534f\u4f5c\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u5141\u8bb8\u4e91\u8bf7\u6c42\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u540e\u81ea\u7136\u51fa\u73b0\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u9075\u5b88\u89c4\u5b9a\u7684\u8f85\u52a9\u9884\u7b97\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cDA-GRPO\u76f8\u6bd4\u4e4b\u524d\u7684\u534f\u4f5c\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u8def\u7531\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5207\u6362\u540e\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u9057\u5fd8\uff0c\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u4e91\u4f7f\u7528\u3002", "conclusion": "DA-GRPO\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u4e91\u4f7f\u7528\u7ea6\u675f\u76f4\u63a5\u7eb3\u5165\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u672c\u5730\u5c0f\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\u3001\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u4e91\u8f85\u52a9\u534f\u4f5c\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u5378\u8f7d\u548c\u707e\u96be\u6027\u9057\u5fd8\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

Existing mitigations remain largely technical and system-centric: tracking capability in advanced systems, shaping behaviour through methods such as reinforcement learning from human feedback, and designing systems to be corrigible and interruptible. Here we develop instrumental goal trajectories to expand these options beyond the model. Gaining capability typically depends on access to additional technical resources, such as compute, storage, data and adjacent services, which in turn requires access to monetary resources. In organisations, these resources can be obtained through three organisational pathways. We label these pathways the procurement, governance and finance instrumental goal trajectories (IGTs). Each IGT produces a trail of organisational artefacts that can be monitored and used as intervention points when a systems capabilities or behaviour exceed acceptable thresholds. In this way, IGTs offer concrete avenues for defining capability levels and for broadening how corrigibility and interruptibility are implemented, shifting attention from model properties alone to the organisational systems that enable them.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\"\u5de5\u5177\u6027\u76ee\u6807\u8f68\u8ff9\"\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u5c06AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u63a7\u5236\u95ee\u9898\u4ece\u6280\u672f\u5c42\u9762\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u7ec4\u7ec7\u5c42\u9762\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u76d1\u63a7\u8d44\u6e90\u83b7\u53d6\u8def\u5f84\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u5bf9\u9ad8\u7ea7AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u76d1\u7ba1\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709AI\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u6280\u672f\u5c42\u9762\u548c\u7cfb\u7edf\u672c\u8eab\uff0c\u4f46\u9ad8\u5ea6\u667a\u80fd\u7684AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u53ef\u80fd\u901a\u8fc7\u8ffd\u6c42\u5de5\u5177\u6027\u76ee\u6807\u4fb5\u8680\u4eba\u7c7b\u63a7\u5236\u3002\u9700\u8981\u8d85\u8d8a\u6a21\u578b\u672c\u8eab\uff0c\u4ece\u7ec4\u7ec7\u5c42\u9762\u5bfb\u627e\u66f4\u5168\u9762\u7684\u63a7\u5236\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e09\u79cd\u7ec4\u7ec7\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u5de5\u5177\u6027\u76ee\u6807\u8f68\u8ff9\uff1a\u91c7\u8d2d\u8f68\u8ff9\u3001\u6cbb\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\u548c\u8d22\u52a1\u8f68\u8ff9\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8f68\u8ff9\u63cf\u8ff0\u4e86AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u83b7\u53d6\u6280\u672f\u8d44\u6e90\uff08\u8ba1\u7b97\u3001\u5b58\u50a8\u3001\u6570\u636e\u7b49\uff09\u548c\u8d27\u5e01\u8d44\u6e90\u7684\u7ec4\u7ec7\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u76d1\u63a7\u8fd9\u4e9b\u8def\u5f84\u4e0a\u7684\u7ec4\u7ec7\u75d5\u8ff9\u6765\u5efa\u7acb\u5e72\u9884\u70b9\u3002", "result": "\u5de5\u5177\u6027\u76ee\u6807\u8f68\u8ff9\u4e3a\u5b9a\u4e49AI\u80fd\u529b\u6c34\u5e73\u548c\u5b9e\u65bd\u53ef\u7ea0\u6b63\u6027\u3001\u53ef\u4e2d\u65ad\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5177\u4f53\u9014\u5f84\uff0c\u5c06\u5173\u6ce8\u70b9\u4ece\u5355\u7eaf\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5c5e\u6027\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u652f\u6491\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7ec4\u7ec7\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u76d1\u63a7AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u83b7\u53d6\u8d44\u6e90\u7684\u7ec4\u7ec7\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u7cfb\u7edf\u80fd\u529b\u6216\u884c\u4e3a\u8d85\u51fa\u53ef\u63a5\u53d7\u9608\u503c\u65f6\u8fdb\u884c\u5e72\u9884\uff0c\u4e3aAI\u63a7\u5236\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u8d85\u8d8a\u6280\u672f\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u7ec4\u7ec7\u5c42\u9762\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

We propose BIONIC (Bayesian Integration of Nonlinear Incomplete Clinical data), a unified probabilistic framework that integrates heterogeneous multimodal data under missingness through a joint generative-discriminative latent architecture. BIONIC uses pretrained embeddings for complex modalities such as medical images and clinical text, while incorporating structured clinical variables directly within a Bayesian multimodal formulation.

Prevalent approaches address this by identifying a small coreset of items to approximate full-benchmark performance. However, existing methods must estimate a reliable item profile from response patterns across many source models, which becomes statistically unstable when the source pool is small. This dependency is particularly limiting for newly released benchmarks with minimal historical evaluation data. We argue that discrete correctness labels are a lossy view of the model's decision process and fail to capture information encoded in hidden states. To address this, we introduce REPCORE, which aligns heterogeneous hidden states into a unified latent space to construct representative coresets. Using these subsets for performance extrapolation, REPCORE achieves precise estimation accuracy with as few as ten source models. Experiments on five benchmarks and over 200 models show consistent gains over output-based baselines in ranking correlation and estimation accuracy.

We introduce GASP (Guided Adversarial Self-Play), a robustification method that explicitly trains detect-and-repair capabilities using only outcome verification. Without human labels or external teachers, GASP forms an adversarial self-play game within a single model: a polluter learns to induce failure via locally coherent corruptions, while an agent learns to diagnose and recover under the same corrupted conditioning. To address the scarcity of successful recoveries early in training, we propose in-distribution repair guidance, an imitation term on self-generated repairs that increases recovery probability while preserving previously acquired capabilities. Across four open-weight models (1.5B--8B), GASP transforms strong-but-brittle reasoners into robust ones that withstand misleading and perturbed context while often improving clean accuracy.

In general, data-driven methods such as those based on deep learning, exhibit higher accuracy than traditional knowledge-based systems. These systems however, are not without significant limitations. The need for large labeled data sets, a lack of generalizibility to new environments (out-of-distribution generalization), and a lack of transparency at inference time are some of the obstacles to adoption in real world environments. In contrast, traditional approaches based on domain expertise in the form of rules, logic or first principles suffer from poor accuracy, many false positives and a need for ongoing expert supervision and manual tuning. While the majority of approaches in recent literature utilize some form of data-driven architecture, there are hybrid systems which also take into account domain specific knowledge. Such hybrid systems have the potential to overcome the weaknesses of either approach on its own while preserving their strengths. We propose taking the hybrid approach even further and integrating deep learning with symbolic logic, or Neuro-symbolic AI, to create more accurate, explainable, interpretable, and robust systems. We describe several neuro-symbolic architectures and examine their strengths and limitations within the PdM domain. We focus specifically on methods which involve the use of sensor data and manually crafted rules as inputs by describing concrete NeSy architectures. In short, this survey outlines the context of modern maintenance, defines key concepts, establishes a generalized framework, reviews current modeling approaches and challenges, and introduces the proposed focus on Neuro-symbolic AI (NESY).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u7cfb\u7edf\u56de\u987e\u4e86\u8fc7\u53bb\u4e94\u5e74\u5de5\u4e1a\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u7ef4\u62a4(PdM)\u7684\u6700\u65b0\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u65b9\u6cd5(\u5982\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60)\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u77e5\u8bc6\u7cfb\u7edf\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\uff0c\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u6570\u636e\u9700\u6c42\u5927\u3001\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u5dee\u3001\u7f3a\u4e4f\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u63d0\u51fa\u5c06\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u7b26\u53f7\u903b\u8f91\u7ed3\u5408\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u7b26\u53f7AI\u4f5c\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "motivation": "\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u7ef4\u62a4\u5728\u5de5\u4e1a\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u9762\u4e34\u4f20\u7edf\u77e5\u8bc6\u7cfb\u7edf\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4f4e\u3001\u8bef\u62a5\u591a\u3001\u9700\u8981\u6301\u7eed\u4e13\u5bb6\u76d1\u7763\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u800c\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u65b9\u6cd5\u867d\u7136\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u9ad8\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u3001\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u5dee\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u963b\u788d\u4e86\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u672c\u6587\u91c7\u7528\u7cfb\u7edf\u7efc\u8ff0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u8fc7\u53bb\u4e94\u5e74\u5de5\u4e1a\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u7ef4\u62a4\u7684\u6700\u65b0\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u5173\u6ce8\u6df7\u5408\u7cfb\u7edf\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5c06\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u7b26\u53f7\u903b\u8f91\u7ed3\u5408\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u7b26\u53f7AI\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5177\u4f53\u63cf\u8ff0\u4f7f\u7528\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u6570\u636e\u548c\u624b\u52a8\u5236\u5b9a\u89c4\u5219\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u795e\u7ecf\u7b26\u53f7\u67b6\u6784\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u77e5\u8bc6\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u969c\u788d\uff1b\u6df7\u5408\u7cfb\u7edf\u80fd\u591f\u7ed3\u5408\u4e24\u8005\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\uff1b\u795e\u7ecf\u7b26\u53f7AI\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\u521b\u5efa\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u4e14\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u795e\u7ecf\u7b26\u53f7AI\u662f\u89e3\u51b3\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u7ef4\u62a4\u9886\u57df\u73b0\u6709\u6311\u6218\u7684\u6709\u524d\u666f\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u7ed3\u5408\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u7b26\u53f7\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u5de5\u4e1a\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u53ef\u9760\u3001\u900f\u660e\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

However, brittle, prototype-derived architectures often plague industrial applications and a lack of systemic oversight, creating a ``responsibility vacuum'' where safety and accountability are compromised. This paper presents an industry case study of the ``Maria'' platform, a production-grade AI system in primary healthcare that addresses this gap.\n  Our central hypothesis is that trustworthy clinical AI is achieved through the holistic integration of four foundational engineering pillars. We present a synergistic architecture that combines Clean Architecture for maintainability with an Event-driven architecture for resilience and auditability. We introduce the Agent as the primary unit of modularity, each possessing its own autonomous MLOps lifecycle. Finally, we show how a Human-in-the-Loop governance model is technically integrated not merely as a safety check, but as a critical, event-driven data source for continuous improvement. We present the platform as a reference architecture, offering practical lessons for engineers building maintainable, scalable, and accountable AI-enabled systems in high-stakes domains.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86Maria\u5e73\u53f0\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u521d\u7ea7\u533b\u7597\u4fdd\u5065\u7684\u751f\u4ea7\u7ea7AI\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u56db\u4e2a\u5de5\u7a0b\u652f\u67f1\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u4e34\u5e8aAI\u7684\u53ef\u4fe1\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c06AI\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u4e34\u5e8a\u73af\u5883\u9762\u4e34\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4ece\u5b64\u7acb\u6a21\u578b\u8f6c\u5411\u7a33\u5065\u3001\u53ef\u6cbb\u7406\u3001\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002\u5de5\u4e1a\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u5e38\u5b58\u5728\u8106\u5f31\u3001\u539f\u578b\u884d\u751f\u7684\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u76d1\u7763\u7f3a\u5931\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\"\u8d23\u4efb\u771f\u7a7a\"\uff0c\u5b89\u5168\u6027\u548c\u95ee\u8d23\u6027\u53d7\u635f\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMaria\u5e73\u53f0\u4f5c\u4e3a\u884c\u4e1a\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u534f\u540c\u67b6\u6784\uff1a\u7ed3\u5408Clean Architecture\uff08\u53ef\u7ef4\u62a4\u6027\uff09\u548c\u4e8b\u4ef6\u9a71\u52a8\u67b6\u6784\uff08\u5f39\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u5ba1\u8ba1\u6027\uff09\uff1b\u5f15\u5165Agent\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e3b\u8981\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u5355\u5143\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e2aAgent\u62e5\u6709\u81ea\u4e3b\u7684MLOps\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\uff1b\u6280\u672f\u4e0a\u96c6\u6210\u4eba\u5728\u56de\u8def\u6cbb\u7406\u6a21\u578b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5173\u952e\u7684\u4e8b\u4ef6\u9a71\u52a8\u6570\u636e\u6e90\u3002", "result": "Maria\u5e73\u53f0\u4f5c\u4e3a\u53c2\u8003\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u4e3a\u5728\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u9886\u57df\u6784\u5efa\u53ef\u7ef4\u62a4\u3001\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u548c\u53ef\u95ee\u8d23\u7684AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u5b9e\u7528\u7ecf\u9a8c\u6559\u8bad\u3002", "conclusion": "\u53ef\u4fe1\u7684\u4e34\u5e8aAI\u9700\u8981\u901a\u8fc7\u56db\u4e2a\u57fa\u7840\u5de5\u7a0b\u652f\u67f1\u7684\u6574\u4f53\u96c6\u6210\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u67b6\u6784\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3001\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u5355\u5143\u3001MLOps\u751f\u547d\u5468\u671f\u548c\u4eba\u5728\u56de\u8def\u6cbb\u7406\u7684\u6280\u672f\u96c6\u6210\u3002"}}

However, as the environment evolves during VLA execution, the optimal sparsity patterns change accordingly. Static pruning lacks the adaptability required for environment dynamics, whereas fixed-interval dynamic layer pruning suffers from coarse granularity and high retraining overheads. To bridge this gap, we propose EcoVLA, a training-free, plug-and-play adaptive pruning framework that supports orthogonal combination with existing VLA acceleration methods. EcoVLA comprises two components: Environment-aware Adaptive Pruning (EAP) and Interleaved Inference Orchestration ($I^2O$). EAP is a lightweight adaptive channel pruning method that incorporates the temporal consistency of the physical environment to update sparsity patterns. $I^2O$ leverages the FLOPs bubbles inherent in VLA inference to schedule the pruning method in parallel, ensuring negligible impact on latency. Evaluated on diverse VLA models and benchmarks, EcoVLA delivers state-of-the-art performance, achieving up to 1.60$\\times$ speedup with only a 0.4% drop in success rate, and further reaches 2.18$\\times$ speedup with only a 0.5% degradation when combined with token pruning.

Most diffusion-based out-of-distribution (OOD) detectors exploit score magnitude or local geometry (energies, curvature, covariance spectra) and largely ignore equivariances. We introduce Group-Equivariant Posterior Consistency (GEPC), a training-free probe that measures how consistently the learned score transforms under a finite group $\\mathcal{G}$, detecting equivariance breaking even when score magnitude remains unchanged. At the population level, we propose the ideal GEPC residual, which averages an equivariance-residual functional over $\\mathcal{G}$, and we derive ID upper bounds and OOD lower bounds under mild assumptions. GEPC requires only score evaluations and produces interpretable equivariance-breaking maps. On OOD image benchmark datasets, we show that GEPC achieves competitive or improved AUROC compared to recent diffusion-based baselines while remaining computationally lightweight. On high-resolution synthetic aperture radar imagery where OOD corresponds to targets or anomalies in clutter, GEPC yields strong target-background separation and visually interpretable equivariance-breaking maps.

We approach this challenge from a Bayesian perspective by focusing on the parameter space of flow matching and diffusion models and constructing a predictive posterior that better captures the variability of the data distribution. In particular, we capture the geometry of the loss using a Riemannian metric and leverage a flexible approximate posterior that adapts to the local structure of the loss landscape. This approach allows us to sample generative models that resemble the original model, but exhibit reduced memorisation. Empirically, we demonstrate that the proposed approach reduces memorisation while preserving generalisation. Further, we provide a theoretical analysis of our method, which explains our findings.

However, in real-world scenarios, the availability of modality data is often dynamic and uncertain, leading to substantial performance fluctuations due to the distribution shifts and semantic deficiencies of the incomplete multimodal inputs. Known as the missing modality issue, this challenge poses a critical barrier to the robustness and practical deployment of MAC models. To systematically quantify this issue, we introduce MissMAC-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to establish fair and unified evaluation standards from the perspective of cross-modal synergy. Two guiding principles are proposed, including no missing prior during training, and one single model capable of handling both complete and incomplete modality scenarios, thereby ensuring better generalization. Moreover, to bridge the gap between academic research and real-world applications, our benchmark integrates evaluation protocols with both fixed and random missing patterns at the dataset and instance levels. Extensive experiments conducted on 3 widely-used language models across 4 datasets validate the effectiveness of diverse MAC approaches in tackling the missing modality issue.

Despite its promise, RLVR remains prohibitively resource-intensive, requiring extensive reward signals and incurring substantial rollout costs during training. In this work, we revisit the fundamental question of data and compute efficiency in RLVR. We first establish a theoretical lower bound on the sample complexity required to unlock reasoning capabilities, and empirically validate that strong performance can be achieved with a surprisingly small number of training instances. To tackle the computational burden, we propose Dynamic One-Shot Policy Refinement (DoPR), an uncertainty-aware RL strategy that dynamically selects a single informative training sample per batch for policy updates, guided by reward volatility and exploration-driven acquisition. DoPR reduces rollout overhead by nearly an order of magnitude while preserving competitive reasoning accuracy, offering a scalable and resource-efficient solution for LLM post-training. This approach offers a practical path toward more efficient and accessible RL-based training for reasoning-intensive LLM applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51faDoPR\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u9009\u62e9\u5355\u4e2a\u4fe1\u606f\u91cf\u6700\u5927\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6837\u672c\u8fdb\u884c\u7b56\u7565\u66f4\u65b0\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4eRLVR\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u63a8\u7406\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u57fa\u4e8e\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5956\u52b1\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\uff08RLVR\uff09\u5728LLM\u63a8\u7406\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u5956\u52b1\u4fe1\u53f7\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u3002\u9700\u8981\u89e3\u51b3RLVR\u7684\u6570\u636e\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u9996\u5148\u5efa\u7acb\u7406\u8bba\u4e0b\u754c\u5206\u6790\u6837\u672c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u63d0\u51fa\u52a8\u6001\u5355\u6837\u672c\u7b56\u7565\u7cbe\u70bc\uff08DoPR\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8e\u5956\u52b1\u6ce2\u52a8\u6027\u548c\u63a2\u7d22\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u83b7\u53d6\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u9009\u62e9\u6bcf\u4e2a\u6279\u6b21\u4e2d\u6700\u5177\u4fe1\u606f\u91cf\u7684\u5355\u4e2a\u8bad\u7ec3\u6837\u672c\u8fdb\u884c\u7b56\u7565\u66f4\u65b0\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\u5f3a\u6027\u80fd\u53ef\u4ee5\u901a\u8fc7\u5c11\u91cf\u8bad\u7ec3\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5b9e\u73b0\uff1bDoPR\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u8bad\u7ec3\u5f00\u9500\u964d\u4f4e\u8fd1\u4e00\u4e2a\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "DoPR\u4e3aLLM\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u4e14\u8d44\u6e90\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u4e3a\u63a8\u7406\u5bc6\u96c6\u578bLLM\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u5b9e\u7528\u548c\u53ef\u8bbf\u95ee\u7684\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

Ensemble methods are often adopted to mitigate these challenges by combining multiple detectors, which can reduce individual biases and increase robustness. Yet building an ensemble that is genuinely complementary remains challenging, since many detectors rely on similar decision cues and end up producing redundant anomaly scores. As a result, the potential of ensemble learning is often limited by the difficulty of identifying models that truly capture different types of irregularities. To address this, we propose a methodology for characterizing anomaly detectors through their decision mechanisms. Using SHapley Additive exPlanations, we quantify how each model attributes importance to input features, and we use these attribution profiles to measure similarity between detectors. We show that detectors with similar explanations tend to produce correlated anomaly scores and identify largely overlapping anomalies. Conversely, explanation divergence reliably indicates complementary detection behavior. Our results demonstrate that explanation-driven metrics offer a different criterion than raw outputs for selecting models in an ensemble. However, we also demonstrate that diversity alone is insufficient; high individual model performance remains a prerequisite for effective ensembles. By explicitly targeting explanation diversity while maintaining model quality, we are able to construct ensembles that are more diverse, more complementary, and ultimately more effective for unsupervised anomaly detection.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eSHAP\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u8868\u5f81\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u91cf\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u8f93\u5165\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u5206\u914d\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u6784\u5efa\u66f4\u4e92\u8865\u3001\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u96c6\u6210\u5b66\u4e60\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "motivation": "\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u9762\u4e34\u6570\u636e\u5206\u5e03\u591a\u6837\u6027\u548c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6807\u7b7e\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002\u96c6\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u867d\u80fd\u51cf\u5c11\u4e2a\u4f53\u504f\u5dee\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u5f80\u5f80\u4f9d\u8d56\u76f8\u4f3c\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u7ebf\u7d22\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5f02\u5e38\u8bc4\u5206\u5197\u4f59\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6784\u5efa\u771f\u6b63\u4e92\u8865\u7684\u96c6\u6210\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528SHAP\uff08SHapley Additive exPlanations\uff09\u91cf\u5316\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u5bf9\u8f93\u5165\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u5206\u914d\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u7684\"\u89e3\u91ca\u5256\u9762\"\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u8fd9\u4e9b\u89e3\u91ca\u5256\u9762\u6d4b\u91cf\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u76f8\u4f3c\u6027\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u5177\u6709\u4e0d\u540c\u51b3\u7b56\u673a\u5236\u7684\u4e92\u8865\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff1a1\uff09\u5177\u6709\u76f8\u4f3c\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u4f1a\u4ea7\u751f\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\u8bc4\u5206\u5e76\u8bc6\u522b\u5927\u91cf\u91cd\u53e0\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\uff1b2\uff09\u89e3\u91ca\u5dee\u5f02\u53ef\u9760\u5730\u6307\u793a\u4e86\u4e92\u8865\u7684\u68c0\u6d4b\u884c\u4e3a\uff1b3\uff09\u89e3\u91ca\u9a71\u52a8\u6307\u6807\u4e3a\u96c6\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u9009\u62e9\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u4e8e\u539f\u59cb\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u65b0\u6807\u51c6\uff1b4\uff09\u4ec5\u6709\u591a\u6837\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u4e2a\u4f53\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u4ecd\u662f\u6709\u6548\u96c6\u6210\u7684\u524d\u63d0\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u660e\u786e\u9488\u5bf9\u89e3\u91ca\u591a\u6837\u6027\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6a21\u578b\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6784\u5efa\u66f4\u591a\u6837\u5316\u3001\u66f4\u4e92\u8865\u4e14\u6700\u7ec8\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u65e0\u76d1\u7763\u5f02\u5e38\u68c0\u6d4b\u96c6\u6210\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002\u89e3\u91ca\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u96c6\u6210\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u9009\u62e9\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89c6\u89d2\u3002"}}

To better understand LLM scaling, we study representational differences between LLMs and their smaller counterparts, with the goal of replicating the representational qualities of larger models in the smaller models. We observe a geometric phenomenon which we term $\\textbf{embedding condensation}$, where token embeddings collapse into a narrow cone-like subspace in some language models. Through systematic analyses across multiple Transformer families, we show that small models such as $\\texttt{GPT2}$ and $\\texttt{Qwen3-0.6B}$ exhibit severe condensation, whereas the larger models such as $\\texttt{GPT2-xl}$ and $\\texttt{Qwen3-32B}$ are more resistant to this phenomenon. Additional observations show that embedding condensation is not reliably mitigated by knowledge distillation from larger models. To fight against it, we formulate a dispersion loss that explicitly encourages embedding dispersion during training. Experiments demonstrate that it mitigates condensation, recovers dispersion patterns seen in larger models, and yields performance gains across 10 benchmarks.

We propose Group Regularization Importance Persistence in 2 Dimensions (GRIP2), a deep knockoff feature importance statistic that integrates first-layer feature activity over a two-dimensional regularization surface controlling both sparsity strength and sparsification geometry. To approximate this surface integral in a single training run, we introduce efficient block-stochastic sampling, which aggregates feature activity magnitudes across diverse regularization regimes along the optimization trajectory. The resulting statistics are antisymmetric by construction, ensuring finite-sample FDR control. In extensive experiments on synthetic and semi-real data, GRIP2 demonstrates improved robustness to feature correlation and noise level: in high correlation and low signal-to-noise ratio regimes where standard deep learning based feature selectors may struggle, our method retains high power and stability. Finally, on real-world HIV drug resistance data, GRIP2 recovers known resistance-associated mutations with power better than established linear baselines, confirming its reliability in practice.", "AI": {"tldr": "GRIP2\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7279\u5f81\u9009\u62e9\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e8c\u7ef4\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u8868\u9762\u79ef\u5206\u548c\u5757\u968f\u673a\u91c7\u6837\uff0c\u5728\u9ad8\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u3001\u4f4e\u4fe1\u566a\u6bd4\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u9519\u8bef\u53d1\u73b0\u7387\u63a7\u5236\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u68c0\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5728\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u3001\u9ad8\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u3001\u4f4e\u4fe1\u566a\u6bd4\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\uff0c\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7279\u5f81\u9009\u62e9\u65b9\u6cd5\u9762\u4e34\u63a7\u5236\u9519\u8bef\u53d1\u73b0\u7387\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5f00\u53d1\u66f4\u7a33\u5065\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u9009\u62e9\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faGRIP2\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a1\uff09\u4f7f\u7528\u4e8c\u7ef4\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u8868\u9762\u63a7\u5236\u7a00\u758f\u5f3a\u5ea6\u548c\u7a00\u758f\u5316\u51e0\u4f55\uff1b2\uff09\u5f15\u5165\u5757\u968f\u673a\u91c7\u6837\u5728\u5355\u6b21\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u8fd1\u4f3c\u8868\u9762\u79ef\u5206\uff1b3\uff09\u6784\u9020\u53cd\u5bf9\u79f0\u7edf\u8ba1\u91cf\u786e\u4fdd\u6709\u9650\u6837\u672cFDR\u63a7\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5408\u6210\u548c\u534a\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0cGRIP2\u5728\u9ad8\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u548c\u4f4e\u4fe1\u566a\u6bd4\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff1b\u5728\u771f\u5b9eHIV\u8010\u836f\u6027\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\uff0c\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u7ebf\u6027\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u5df2\u77e5\u8010\u836f\u7a81\u53d8\u3002", "conclusion": "GRIP2\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u9ad8\u68c0\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u4e25\u683c\u63a7\u5236\u9519\u8bef\u53d1\u73b0\u7387\uff0c\u5728\u9ad8\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u3001\u4f4e\u4fe1\u566a\u6bd4\u7684\u590d\u6742\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u5177\u6709\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002"}}

Over time, this erodes users' ability to explain, verify, or intervene. We define this divergence as the Capability-Comprehension Gap: a decoupling where assisted performance improves while users' internal models deteriorate. This paper argues that prevailing approaches to transparency, user control, literacy, and governance do not define the foundational understanding humans must retain for oversight under sustained AI delegation. To formalize this, we define the Cognitive Integrity Threshold (CIT) as the minimum comprehension required to preserve oversight, autonomy, and accountable participation under AI assistance. CIT does not require full reasoning reconstruction, nor does it constrain automation. It identifies the threshold beyond which oversight becomes procedural and contestability fails. We operatinalize CIT through three functional dimensions: (i) verification capacity, (ii) comprehension-preserving interaction, and (iii) institutional scaffolds for governance.

However, current sampling methods rely on simple confidence-based heuristics that ignore the long-term impact of local decisions, leading to trajectory lock-in where early hallucinations cascade into global incoherence. While search-based methods mitigate this, they incur prohibitive computational costs ($O(K)$ forward passes per step). In this work, we propose Backward-on-Entropy (BoE) Steering, a gradient-guided inference framework that approximates infinite-horizon lookahead via a single backward pass. We formally derive the Token Influence Score (TIS) from a first-order expansion of the trajectory cost functional, proving that the gradient of future entropy with respect to input embeddings serves as an optimal control signal for minimizing uncertainty. To ensure scalability, we introduce \\texttt{ActiveQueryAttention}, a sparse adjoint primitive that exploits the structure of the masking objective to reduce backward pass complexity. BoE achieves a superior Pareto frontier for inference-time scaling compared to existing unmasking methods, demonstrating that gradient-guided steering offers a mathematically principled and efficient path to robust non-autoregressive generation.

In this work, we identify a distinct failure mode that previous study overlooked: Attention Distraction (AD). When the retrieved context is sufficient (highly relevant or including the correct answer), the retrieved text suppresses the visual attention globally, and the attention on image tokens shifts away from question-relevant regions. This leads to failures on questions the model could originally answer correctly without the retrieved text. To mitigate this issue, we propose MAD-RAG, a training-free intervention that decouples visual grounding from context integration through a dual-question formulation, combined with attention mixing to preserve image-conditioned evidence. Extensive experiments on OK-VQA, E-VQA, and InfoSeek demonstrate that MAD-RAG consistently outperforms existing baselines across different model families, yielding absolute gains of up to 4.76%, 9.20%, and 6.18% over the vanilla RAG baseline.

Despite this potential, existing pipelines largely train isolated task-specific models on raw CAN data, with only limited efforts exploring decoded signals. Such fragmentation prevents shared representation learning and limits cross-task generalization. By contrast, natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision (CV) have been transformed by the foundation model paradigm: large-scale pretraining followed by task-specific adaptation. In this work, we introduce the foundation CAN model that demonstrates multi-objective downstream generalization using a single pretrained backbone. Our approach treats CAN data as a language: we pretrain on large-scale, unlabeled decoded CAN signals and fine-tune across heterogeneous auto insurance tasks. To enable this, we propose a unified tokenization scheme for mixed discrete-continuous signals and address challenges of temporal complexity and trip-specific variability. Our results show that one pretrained CAN model can adapt effectively to diverse predictive tasks, validating that the foundation modeling paradigm, proven in NLP and CV, also holds for CAN data.

Rahmani", "Mengting Wan", "Pei Zhou", "Longqi Yang", "Nick Craswell", "Emine Yilmaz", "Sujay Kumar Jauhar"], "title": "Beyond Output Critique: Self-Correction via Task Distillation", "comment": null, "summary": "Large language models (LLMs) have shown promising self-correction abilities, where iterative refinement improves the quality of generated responses. However, most existing approaches operate at the level of output critique, patching surface errors while often failing to correct deeper reasoning flaws. We propose SELF-THOUGHT, a framework that introduces an intermediate step of task abstraction before solution refinement. Given an input and an initial response, the model first distills the task into a structured template that captures key variables, constraints, and problem structure. This abstraction then guides solution instantiation, grounding subsequent responses in a clearer understanding of the task and reducing error propagation. Crucially, we show that these abstractions can be transferred across models: templates generated by larger models can serve as structured guides for smaller LLMs, which typically struggle with intrinsic self-correction. By reusing distilled task structures, smaller models achieve more reliable refinements without heavy fine-tuning or reliance on external verifiers.

However, the theoretical mechanisms governing generation order and the risks inherent in parallelization remain under-explored. In this work, we provide a unified information-theoretic framework to decouple and analyze two fundamental sources of failure: order sensitivity and parallelization bias. Our analysis yields three key insights: (1) The benefits of Easy-First decoding (prioritizing low-entropy tokens) are magnified as model error increases; (2) factorized parallel decoding introduces intrinsic sampling errors that can lead to arbitrary large Reverse KL divergence, capturing \"incoherence\" failures that standard Forward KL metrics overlook; and (3) while verification can eliminate sampling error, it incurs an exponential cost governed by the total correlation within a block. Conversely, heuristics like remasking, though computationally efficient, cannot guarantee distributional correctness.

To help address this issue, we show that self-attention is efficiently computable to arbitrary precision with constant cost per token, achieving orders-of-magnitude reductions in memory use and computation. We derive our formulation by decomposing the conventional formulation's Taylor expansion into expressions over symmetric chains of tensor products. We exploit their symmetry to obtain feed-forward transformations that efficiently map queries and keys to coordinates in a minimal polynomial-kernel feature basis. Notably, cost is fixed inversely in proportion to head size, enabling application over a greater number of heads per token than otherwise feasible.

Yu"], "title": "From Observations to States: Latent Time Series Forecasting", "comment": null, "summary": "Deep learning has achieved strong performance in Time Series Forecasting (TSF). However, we identify a critical representation paradox, termed Latent Chaos: models with accurate predictions often learn latent representations that are temporally disordered and lack continuity. We attribute this phenomenon to the dominant observation-space forecasting paradigm. Most TSF models minimize point-wise errors on noisy and partially observed data, which encourages shortcut solutions instead of the recovery of underlying system dynamics. To address this issue, we propose Latent Time Series Forecasting (LatentTSF), a novel paradigm that shifts TSF from observation regression to latent state prediction. Specifically, LatentTSF employs an AutoEncoder to project observations at each time step into a higher-dimensional latent state space. This expanded representation aims to capture underlying system variables and impose a smoother temporal structure. Forecasting is then performed entirely in the latent space, allowing the model to focus on learning structured temporal dynamics. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that our proposed latent objectives implicitly maximize mutual information between predicted latent states and ground-truth states and observations. Extensive experiments on widely-used benchmarks confirm that LatentTSF effectively mitigates latent chaos, achieving superior performance.

While most research has been focused on English-based models, low-resource languages such as Brazilian Portuguese face significant challenges due to the lack of specialized datasets and models. Several studies create datasets by automatically translating existing ones to mitigate resource scarcity. This work addresses this gap by proposing a cross-native-translated evaluation of Transformer-based vision and language models for Brazilian Portuguese IC. We use a version of Flickr30K comprised of captions manually created by native Brazilian Portuguese speakers and compare it to a version with captions automatically translated from English to Portuguese. The experiments include a cross-context approach, where models trained on one dataset are tested on the other to assess the translation impact. Additionally, we incorporate attention maps for model inference interpretation and use the CLIP-Score metric to evaluate the image-description alignment. Our findings show that Swin-DistilBERTimbau consistently outperforms other models, demonstrating strong generalization across datasets. ViTucano, a Brazilian Portuguese pre-trained VLM, surpasses larger multilingual models (GPT-4o, LLaMa 3.2 Vision) in traditional text-based evaluation metrics, while GPT-4 models achieve the highest CLIP-Score, highlighting improved image-text alignment. Attention analysis reveals systematic biases, including gender misclassification, object enumeration errors, and spatial inconsistencies.

A common heuristic treats small-margin (ambiguous) pairs as noisy and filters them out. In this paper, we revisit this assumption and show that pair difficulty interacts strongly with the optimization objective: when trained with preference-based losses, difficult pairs can destabilize training and harm alignment, yet these same pairs still contain useful supervision signals when optimized with supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Motivated by this observation, we propose MixDPO, a simple yet effective difficulty-aware training strategy that (i) orders preference data from easy to hard (a curriculum over margin-defined difficulty), and (ii) routes difficult pairs to an SFT objective while applying a preference loss to easy pairs. This hybrid design provides a practical mechanism to leverage ambiguous pairs without incurring the optimization failures often associated with preference losses on low-margin data. Across three LLM-judge benchmarks, MixDPO consistently improves alignment over DPO and a range of widely-used variants, with particularly strong gains on AlpacaEval~2 length-controlled (LC) win rate.", "AI": {"tldr": "MixDPO\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u96be\u5ea6\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u56f0\u96be\u504f\u597d\u5bf9\u8def\u7531\u5230SFT\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u7b80\u5355\u504f\u597d\u5bf9\u4f7f\u7528\u504f\u597d\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528\u6a21\u7cca\u504f\u597d\u5bf9\u4e2d\u7684\u76d1\u7763\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u504f\u597d\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u5982DPO\uff09\u5bf9\u504f\u597d\u5bf9\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u96be\u5ea6\u9ad8\u5ea6\u654f\u611f\uff0c\u901a\u5e38\u5c06\u5c0f\u8fb9\u9645\uff08\u6a21\u7cca\uff09\u5bf9\u89c6\u4e3a\u566a\u58f0\u5e76\u8fc7\u6ee4\u6389\u3002\u7136\u800c\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff0c\u56f0\u96be\u5bf9\u5728\u504f\u597d\u635f\u5931\u4e0b\u4f1a\u7834\u574f\u8bad\u7ec3\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u4e2d\u4ecd\u5305\u542b\u6709\u7528\u7684\u76d1\u7763\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002", "method": "MixDPO\u91c7\u7528\u96be\u5ea6\u611f\u77e5\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\uff1a1\uff09\u6309\u8fb9\u9645\u5b9a\u4e49\u7684\u96be\u5ea6\u4ece\u6613\u5230\u96be\u6392\u5e8f\u504f\u597d\u6570\u636e\uff08\u8bfe\u7a0b\u5b66\u4e60\uff09\uff1b2\uff09\u5c06\u56f0\u96be\u5bf9\u8def\u7531\u5230SFT\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u800c\u5bf9\u7b80\u5355\u5bf9\u5e94\u7528\u504f\u597d\u635f\u5931\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u6df7\u5408\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5229\u7528\u6a21\u7cca\u5bf9\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u4e2aLLM-judge\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cMixDPO\u5728DPO\u548c\u4e00\u7cfb\u5217\u5e7f\u6cdb\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u53d8\u4f53\u4e0a\u6301\u7eed\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5bf9\u9f50\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5728AlpacaEval~2\u957f\u5ea6\u63a7\u5236\u80dc\u7387\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u7279\u522b\u5f3a\u7684\u589e\u76ca\u3002", "conclusion": "MixDPO\u901a\u8fc7\u96be\u5ea6\u611f\u77e5\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u504f\u597d\u4f18\u5316\u4e2d\u56f0\u96be\u5bf9\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u4e86\u6a21\u7cca\u5bf9\u4e2d\u7684\u76d1\u7763\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5bf9\u9f50\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Most existing ARL methods train a single shared model parameters to support both reasoning and tool use behaviors, implicitly assuming that joint training leads to improved overall agent performance. Despite its widespread adoption, this assumption has rarely been examined empirically. In this paper, we systematically investigate this assumption by introducing a Linear Effect Attribution System(LEAS), which provides quantitative evidence of interference between reasoning and tool-use behaviors. Through an in-depth analysis, we show that these two capabilities often induce misaligned gradient directions, leading to training interference that undermines the effectiveness of joint optimization and challenges the prevailing ARL paradigm. To address this issue, we propose Disentangled Action Reasoning Tuning(DART), a simple and efficient framework that explicitly decouples parameter updates for reasoning and tool-use via separate low-rank adaptation modules. Experimental results show that DART consistently outperforms baseline methods with averaged 6.35 percent improvements and achieves performance comparable to multi-agent systems that explicitly separate tool-use and reasoning using a single model.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u7814\u7a76\u4e86ARL\u4e2d\u8054\u5408\u8bad\u7ec3\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u5de5\u5177\u4f7f\u7528\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u4e24\u8005\u5b58\u5728\u68af\u5ea6\u5e72\u6270\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u89e3\u8026\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6DART\u63d0\u5347\u6027\u80fd", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709ARL\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u5047\u8bbe\u8054\u5408\u8bad\u7ec3\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u5de5\u5177\u4f7f\u7528\u80fd\u529b\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u6574\u4f53\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u4e00\u5047\u8bbe\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5b9e\u8bc1\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002\u8bba\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u8fd9\u4e00\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u4e24\u79cd\u80fd\u529b\u5728\u8054\u5408\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u662f\u5426\u5b58\u5728\u5e72\u6270\u3002", "method": "1. \u5f15\u5165\u7ebf\u6027\u6548\u5e94\u5f52\u56e0\u7cfb\u7edf(LEAS)\u91cf\u5316\u63a8\u7406\u4e0e\u5de5\u5177\u4f7f\u7528\u884c\u4e3a\u95f4\u7684\u5e72\u6270\uff1b2. \u63d0\u51fa\u89e3\u8026\u52a8\u4f5c\u63a8\u7406\u8c03\u4f18(DART)\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u72ec\u7acb\u7684\u4f4e\u79e9\u9002\u5e94\u6a21\u5757\u5206\u522b\u4f18\u5316\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u5de5\u5177\u4f7f\u7528\u53c2\u6570", "result": "1.

Many existing methods rely on trial-and-error, testing different prompts or in-context examples until a good configuration emerges, often consuming substantial compute. Recently, natural language feedback derived from execution logs has shown promise as a way to identify how prompts can be improved. However, most prior approaches operate in a bottom-up manner, iteratively adjusting the prompt based on feedback from individual problems, which can cause them to lose the global perspective. In this work, we propose Error Taxonomy-Guided Prompt Optimization (ETGPO), a prompt optimization algorithm that adopts a top-down approach. ETGPO focuses on the global failure landscape by collecting model errors, categorizing them into a taxonomy, and augmenting the prompt with guidance targeting the most frequent failure modes. Across multiple benchmarks spanning mathematics, question answering, and logical reasoning, ETGPO achieves accuracy that is comparable to or better than state-of-the-art methods, while requiring roughly one third of the optimization-phase token usage and evaluation budget.", "AI": {"tldr": "ETGPO\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u9519\u8bef\u5206\u7c7b\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u81ea\u4e0a\u800c\u4e0b\u7b56\u7565\u5206\u6790\u5168\u5c40\u5931\u8d25\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u51cf\u5c11\u7ea6\u4e09\u5206\u4e4b\u4e8c\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u9636\u6bb5token\u4f7f\u7528\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u9884\u7b97\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u81ea\u52a8\u63d0\u793a\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u5927\u591a\u91c7\u7528\u81ea\u4e0b\u800c\u4e0a\u7684\u8bd5\u9519\u65b9\u5f0f\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5355\u4e2a\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u53cd\u9988\u8fed\u4ee3\u8c03\u6574\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5168\u5c40\u89c6\u89d2\uff0c\u4e14\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u6602\u3002", "method": "ETGPO\u91c7\u7528\u81ea\u4e0a\u800c\u4e0b\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a1) \u6536\u96c6\u6a21\u578b\u9519\u8bef\uff1b2) \u5c06\u9519\u8bef\u5206\u7c7b\u4e3a\u5206\u7c7b\u5b66\uff1b3) \u9488\u5bf9\u6700\u9891\u7e41\u7684\u5931\u8d25\u6a21\u5f0f\u5728\u63d0\u793a\u4e2d\u6dfb\u52a0\u6307\u5bfc\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u3001\u95ee\u7b54\u548c\u903b\u8f91\u63a8\u7406\u7b49\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cETGPO\u8fbe\u5230\u6216\u4f18\u4e8e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4f18\u5316\u9636\u6bb5\u7684token\u4f7f\u7528\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u9884\u7b97\u51cf\u5c11\u7ea6\u4e09\u5206\u4e4b\u4e00\u3002", "conclusion": "ETGPO\u901a\u8fc7\u9519\u8bef\u5206\u7c7b\u5b66\u7684\u5168\u5c40\u89c6\u89d2\u8fdb\u884c\u63d0\u793a\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u964d\u4f4e\u4e86\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u6548\u63d0\u793a\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

We present a formal analysis of how alignment from human feedback can increase this failure mode by identifying an explicit amplification mechanism that causally links optimization against a learned reward to bias in the human preference data used for alignment. We show that the direction of behavioral drift is determined by a covariance under the base policy between endorsing the belief signal in the prompt and the learned reward, and that the first-order effect reduces to a simple mean-gap condition. We then analyze reward learning from pairwise comparisons under random utility models like Bradley-Terry and characterize when bias in human annotators' preferences induces this reward gap. Next, we propose a training-time intervention designed to neutralize the amplification mechanism itself. Among all post-trained policies that prevent sycophantic behavior from increasing, we characterize the unique policy closest in KL divergence to the unconstrained post-trained policy, and derive the corresponding minimal reward correction as a closed-form agreement penalty.

Yet, existing steering methods are remarkably brittle, with seemingly non-steerable concepts becoming completely steerable based on subtle algorithmic choices in how concept-related features are extracted. In this work, we introduce an attention-guided steering framework that overcomes three core challenges associated with steering: (1) automatic selection of relevant token embeddings for extracting concept-related features; (2) accounting for heterogeneity of concept-related features across LLM activations; and (3) identification of layers most relevant for steering. Across a steering benchmark of 512 semantic concepts, our framework substantially improved steering over previous state-of-the-art (nearly doubling the number of successfully steered concepts) across model architectures and sizes (up to 70 billion parameter models). Furthermore, we use our framework to shed light on the distribution of concept-specific features across LLM layers.

To ensure disentangled credit distribution, we implement a Decoupled Masking Strategy, applying process-oriented rewards specifically to the chain-of-thought (CoT) and outcome-oriented rewards to the full completion. Additionally, we incorporate a Dual-Gated SFT objective to stabilize training with high-quality structural and factual signals. Extensive experiments across textual and multi-modal benchmarks (e.g., MATH, Super-CLEVR) demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms baselines such as GRPO in both sample efficiency and final accuracy.

However, such improvements often come with reduced outcome diversity, where the model concentrates probability mass on a narrow set of solutions. Motivated by diminishing-returns principles, we introduce a set level diversity objective defined over sampled trajectories using kernelized similarity. Our approach derives a leave-one-out marginal contribution for each sampled trajectory and integrates this objective as a plug-in advantage shaping term for policy optimization. We further investigate the contribution of a single trajectory to language model diversity within a distribution perturbation framework. This analysis theoretically confirms a monotonicity property, proving that rarer trajectories yield consistently higher marginal contributions to the global diversity.

Beyond producing ready-to-use models, the system generates comprehensive reports to support trustworthy interpretation and risk-aware decision-making. To rigorously evaluate its effectiveness, we curate a challenging real-world benchmark comprising 17 tasks across diverse data modalities and learning settings. \\textit{AutoHealth} completes all tasks and outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by 29.2\\% in prediction performance and 50.2\\% in uncertainty estimation.", "AI": {"tldr": "AutoHealth\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u533b\u7597\u6570\u636e\u81ea\u52a8\u5efa\u6a21\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u534f\u4f5c\u5b9e\u73b0\u6570\u636e\u63a2\u7d22\u3001\u6a21\u578b\u6784\u5efa\u3001\u8bad\u7ec3\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u9762\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709LLM\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5728\u533b\u7597\u6570\u636e\u5e94\u7528\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff1a\u96be\u4ee5\u6cdb\u5316\u5230\u5f02\u6784\u533b\u7597\u6570\u636e\u6a21\u6001\u3001\u8fc7\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u9884\u5b9a\u4e49\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u6a21\u677f\u3001\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\u7684\u5173\u6ce8\uff0c\u800c\u533b\u7597\u51b3\u7b56\u9700\u8981\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faAutoHealth\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4e94\u4e2a\u4e13\u95e8\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u95ed\u73af\u534f\u8c03\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u6267\u884c\u6570\u636e\u63a2\u7d22\u3001\u4efb\u52a1\u6761\u4ef6\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u6784\u5efa\u3001\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4f18\u5148\u8003\u8651\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u91cf\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5305\u542b17\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u533b\u7597\u6570\u636e\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cAutoHealth\u5b8c\u6210\u6240\u6709\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u6bd4\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u57fa\u7ebf\u63d0\u9ad829.2%\uff0c\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u9ad850.2%\u3002", "conclusion": "AutoHealth\u7cfb\u7edf\u80fd\u591f\u81ea\u4e3b\u5efa\u6a21\u533b\u7597\u6570\u636e\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u9760\u6027\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u53ef\u76f4\u63a5\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u5168\u9762\u62a5\u544a\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u53ef\u4fe1\u89e3\u91ca\u548c\u98ce\u9669\u611f\u77e5\u51b3\u7b56\uff0c\u4e3a\u533b\u7597AI\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u9760\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

While large language models (LLMs) offer promising avenues for automation, existing methods often suffer from low data efficiency, limited solver-level validity, and poor scalability to industrial-scale problems. To address these challenges, we present EvoOpt-LLM, a unified LLM-based framework supporting the full lifecycle of industrial optimization modeling, including automated model construction, dynamic business-constraint injection, and end-to-end variable pruning. Built on a 7B-parameter LLM and adapted via parameter-efficient LoRA fine-tuning, EvoOpt-LLM achieves a generation rate of 91% and an executability rate of 65.9% with only 3,000 training samples, with critical performance gains emerging under 1,500 samples. The constraint injection module reliably augments existing MILP models while preserving original objectives, and the variable pruning module enhances computational efficiency, achieving an F1 score of ~0.56 on medium-sized LP models with only 400 samples.

We introduce Sparse Knowledge Distillation (SparseKD), a post-training method that compresses transformer models by combining structured SVD pruning with self-referential knowledge distillation. The key insight is simple: instead of using an external teacher, the model teaches itself by matching its own probability distribution from before compression. This self-referential setup enables surprisingly strong quality recovery after aggressive pruning.\n  Our experiments reveal an unexpected finding: self-referential distillation alone, applied post-training under an identical objective and fixed calibration dataset, improves model quality by 39% relative to the original converged checkpoint. When combined with structured pruning, SparseKD achieves 15-65% parameter reduction with acceptable quality trade-offs. Kernel profiling shows that speedups arise entirely from reduced dense matrix multiplication in feed-forward layers while attention remains unchanged, making this approach complementary to attention optimizations.\n  We validate across two model families (0.6B and 3.8B parameters) with multi-seed experiments confirming high reproducibility.

Existing benchmarks make it difficult to assess whether incorporating visual experimental data during post-training improves mechanism-grounded explanation reasoning beyond text-only supervision. We introduce MATRIX, a multimodal benchmark for materials science reasoning that evaluates foundational theory, research-level reasoning, and the interpretation of real experimental artifacts across multiple characterization modalities. Using MATRIX as a controlled diagnostic, we isolate the effect of visual grounding by comparing post-training on structured materials science text alone with post-training that incorporates paired experimental images. Despite using relatively small amounts of multimodal data, visual supervision improves experimental interpretation by 10-25% and yields 5-16% gains on text-only scientific reasoning tasks. Our results demonstrate that these improvements rely on correct image-text alignment during post-training, highlighting cross-modal representational transfer. We also observe consistent improvements on ScienceQA and PubMedQA, demonstrating that the benefits of structured multimodal post-training extend beyond materials science.

The proposed method enables the generation of missing design components based on a partial reference design while satisfying performance constraints, without retraining the underlying model. By applying mask-based resampling during inference process, RePaint allows efficient and controllable repainting of partial designs under both performance and parameter constraints, which is not supported by conventional DDPM-base methods. The framework is evaluated on two representative design problems, parametric ship hull design and airfoil design, demonstrating its ability to generate novel designs with expected performance based on a partial reference design. Results show that the method achieves accuracy comparable to or better than pre-trained models while enabling controlled novelty through fixing partial designs. Overall, the proposed approach provides an efficient, training-free solution for parameter-constraint-aware generative design in engineering applications.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8eRePaint\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u96c6\u6210\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u5f15\u5bfc\u53bb\u566a\u6269\u6563\u6982\u7387\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u53c2\u6570\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u5de5\u7a0b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u5373\u53ef\u6839\u636e\u90e8\u5206\u53c2\u8003\u8bbe\u8ba1\u751f\u6210\u7f3a\u5931\u7ec4\u4ef6\u5e76\u6ee1\u8db3\u6027\u80fd\u7ea6\u675f\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u57fa\u4e8eDDPM\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u540c\u65f6\u652f\u6301\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u53c2\u6570\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u7684\u90e8\u5206\u8bbe\u8ba1\u91cd\u7ed8\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u91cd\u65b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u3001\u80fd\u591f\u6839\u636e\u90e8\u5206\u53c2\u8003\u8bbe\u8ba1\u751f\u6210\u6ee1\u8db3\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u5b8c\u6574\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faRePaint\u589e\u5f3a\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u96c6\u6210\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u5f15\u5bfcDDPM\uff0c\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5e94\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u63a9\u7801\u7684\u91cd\u91c7\u6837\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u90e8\u5206\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5728\u6027\u80fd\u548c\u53c2\u6570\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u53ef\u63a7\u91cd\u7ed8\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u8239\u4f53\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u7ffc\u578b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e24\u4e2a\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u57fa\u4e8e\u90e8\u5206\u53c2\u8003\u8bbe\u8ba1\u751f\u6210\u5177\u6709\u9884\u671f\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u65b0\u9896\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u7cbe\u5ea6\u8fbe\u5230\u6216\u4f18\u4e8e\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u901a\u8fc7\u56fa\u5b9a\u90e8\u5206\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u63a7\u521b\u65b0\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u5de5\u7a0b\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u7ea6\u675f\u611f\u77e5\u751f\u6210\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6027\u80fd\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u63a7\u521b\u65b0\u3002"}}

Training instability severely undermines model capability improvement, yet its underlying causes and mechanisms remain poorly understood. In this work, we introduce a principled framework for understanding RLVR instability through the lens of objective-level hacking. Unlike reward hacking, which arises from exploitable verifiers, objective-level hacking emerges from token-level credit misalignment and is manifested as system-level spurious signals in the optimization objective. Grounded in our framework, together with extensive experiments on a 30B MoE model, we trace the origin and formalize the mechanism behind a key pathological training dynamic in MoE models: the abnormal growth of the training-inference discrepancy, a phenomenon widely associated with instability but previously lacking a mechanistic explanation. These findings provide a concrete and causal account of the training dynamics underlying instabilities in MoE models, offering guidance for the design of stable RLVR algorithms.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7406\u89e3RLVR\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\"\u76ee\u6807\u7ea7\u9ed1\u5ba2\u653b\u51fb\"\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u89e3\u91ca\u4e86MoE\u67b6\u6784\u4e2d\u8bad\u7ec3-\u63a8\u7406\u5dee\u5f02\u5f02\u5e38\u589e\u957f\u7684\u673a\u5236\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e0e\u53ef\u9a8c\u8bc1\u5956\u52b1\uff08RLVR\uff09\u867d\u7136\u80fd\u6301\u7eed\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u5728MoE\u67b6\u6784\u4e2d\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u95ee\u9898\u4e25\u91cd\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u529b\u63d0\u5347\u3002\u76ee\u524d\u5bf9\u8fd9\u79cd\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u6839\u672c\u539f\u56e0\u548c\u673a\u5236\u4e86\u89e3\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\"\u76ee\u6807\u7ea7\u9ed1\u5ba2\u653b\u51fb\"\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7token\u7ea7\u4fe1\u7528\u9519\u4f4d\u548c\u7cfb\u7edf\u7ea7\u865a\u5047\u4fe1\u53f7\u6765\u89e3\u91ca\u4f18\u5316\u76ee\u6807\u4e2d\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u572830B\u53c2\u6570\u7684MoE\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u8ffd\u8e2a\u5e76\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u4e86\u8bad\u7ec3-\u63a8\u7406\u5dee\u5f02\u5f02\u5e38\u589e\u957f\u7684\u5173\u952e\u75c5\u7406\u52a8\u6001\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u5e76\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u4e86MoE\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u5173\u952e\u673a\u5236\uff1a\u8bad\u7ec3-\u63a8\u7406\u5dee\u5f02\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\u589e\u957f\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u75c5\u7406\u52a8\u6001\u6e90\u4e8e\u76ee\u6807\u7ea7\u9ed1\u5ba2\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u5373token\u7ea7\u4fe1\u7528\u9519\u4f4d\u5bfc\u81f4\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u7ea7\u865a\u5047\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8fd9\u4e9b\u53d1\u73b0\u4e3aMoE\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5177\u4f53\u4e14\u56e0\u679c\u6027\u7684\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u4e3a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684RLVR\u7b97\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6307\u5bfc\u3002\u76ee\u6807\u7ea7\u9ed1\u5ba2\u653b\u51fb\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3RLVR\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u89c6\u89d2\u3002"}}

This robustness, however, is not absolute. We identify a simple yet effective failure mode, termed context nesting, where harmful requests are embedded within structured benign contexts, effectively bypassing the stepwise reduction mechanism. Empirically, we show that this simple strategy is sufficient to bypass D-LLMs' safety blessing, achieving state-of-the-art attack success rates across models and benchmarks. Most notably, it enables the first successful jailbreak of Gemini Diffusion, to our knowledge, exposing a critical vulnerability in commercial D-LLMs. Together, our results characterize both the origins and the limits of D-LLMs' safety blessing, constituting an early-stage red-teaming of D-LLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u6269\u6563\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08D-LLMs\uff09\u76f8\u6bd4\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\u5177\u6709\u5185\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u4f18\u52bf\uff0c\u4f46\u5b58\u5728\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5d4c\u5957\u653b\u51fb\u6f0f\u6d1e", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u6269\u6563\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08D-LLMs\uff09\u76f8\u5bf9\u4e8e\u81ea\u56de\u5f52LLMs\uff08AR-LLMs\uff09\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5176\u5bf9\u8d8a\u72f1\u653b\u51fb\u7684\u5185\u5728\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u673a\u5236", "method": "\u5206\u6790D-LLMs\u7684\u6269\u6563\u8f68\u8ff9\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u9010\u6b65\u6291\u5236\u4e0d\u5b89\u5168\u751f\u6210\u7684\u7279\u70b9\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\"\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5d4c\u5957\"\u8fd9\u4e00\u7b80\u5355\u6709\u6548\u7684\u653b\u51fb\u65b9\u6cd5", "result": "D-LLMs\u786e\u5b9e\u5bf9\u4f20\u7edfAR-LLMs\u8d8a\u72f1\u653b\u51fb\u5177\u6709\u5185\u5728\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u4f46\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5d4c\u5957\u653b\u51fb\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u7ed5\u8fc7\u8fd9\u79cd\u4fdd\u62a4\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\u7387\uff0c\u9996\u6b21\u6210\u529f\u8d8a\u72f1Gemini Diffusion", "conclusion": "D-LLMs\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u4f18\u52bf\u6e90\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u8f68\u8ff9\u7684\u9010\u6b65\u6291\u5236\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4f46\u5e76\u975e\u7edd\u5bf9\u5b89\u5168\uff0c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5d4c\u5957\u653b\u51fb\u66b4\u9732\u4e86\u5176\u5173\u952e\u6f0f\u6d1e\uff0c\u4e3aD-LLMs\u7684\u65e9\u671f\u7ea2\u961f\u6d4b\u8bd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u89c1\u89e3"}}

While most existing efforts focus on scaling up language models or constructing higher-quality training data, limited attention has been paid to effectively integrating cross-modal knowledge into the language space. In vision-language models, for instance, aligning modalities using only high-level visual features often discards the rich semantic information present in mid- and low-level features, limiting the model's ability of cross-modality understanding. To address this issue, we propose SparseCut, a general cross-modal fusion architecture for MLLMs, introducing sparse shortcut connections between the cross-modal encoder and the LLM. These shortcut connections enable the efficient and hierarchical integration of visual features at multiple levels, facilitating richer semantic fusion without increasing computational overhead. We further introduce an efficient multi-grained feature fusion module, which performs the fusion of visual features before routing them through the shortcuts. This preserves the original language context and does not increase the overall input length, thereby avoiding an increase in computational complexity for the LLM. Experiments demonstrate that SparseCut significantly enhances the performance of MLLMs across various multimodal benchmarks with generality and scalability for different base LLMs.", "AI": {"tldr": "SparseCut\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08MLLMs\uff09\u7684\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u878d\u5408\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7a00\u758f\u5feb\u6377\u8fde\u63a5\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u5c42\u6b21\u89c6\u89c9\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u5206\u5c42\u878d\u5408\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\u800c\u4e0d\u589e\u52a0\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709MLLMs\u5927\u591a\u5173\u6ce8\u6269\u5c55\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u6216\u6784\u5efa\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6709\u6548\u5c06\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u77e5\u8bc6\u6574\u5408\u5230\u8bed\u8a00\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\uff0c\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u9ad8\u5c42\u89c6\u89c9\u7279\u5f81\u8fdb\u884c\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u9f50\u4f1a\u4e22\u5f03\u4e2d\u4f4e\u5c42\u7279\u5f81\u4e2d\u7684\u4e30\u5bcc\u8bed\u4e49\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSparseCut\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5728\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u548cLLM\u4e4b\u95f4\u5f15\u5165\u7a00\u758f\u5feb\u6377\u8fde\u63a5\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u5c42\u6b21\u89c6\u89c9\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u5206\u5c42\u878d\u5408\u3002\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u63d0\u51fa\u9ad8\u6548\u591a\u7c92\u5ea6\u7279\u5f81\u878d\u5408\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u5728\u901a\u8fc7\u5feb\u6377\u8fde\u63a5\u8def\u7531\u524d\u8fdb\u884c\u89c6\u89c9\u7279\u5f81\u878d\u5408\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u539f\u59cb\u8bed\u8a00\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4e14\u4e0d\u589e\u52a0\u8f93\u5165\u957f\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cSparseCut\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86MLLMs\u5728\u5404\u79cd\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e0a\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e0d\u540c\u57fa\u7840LLM\u5177\u6709\u901a\u7528\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "SparseCut\u901a\u8fc7\u7a00\u758f\u5feb\u6377\u8fde\u63a5\u548c\u591a\u7c92\u5ea6\u7279\u5f81\u878d\u5408\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86MLLMs\u4e2d\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u77e5\u8bc6\u6574\u5408\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

While modern diagnostic systems primarily rely on sequences of vehicular Diagnostic Trouble Codes (DTCs) registered in On-Board Diagnostic (OBD) systems, they often overlook valuable contextual information such as raw sensory data (e.g., temperature, humidity, and pressure). This contextual data, crucial for domain experts to classify vehicle failures, introduces unique challenges due to its complexity and the noisy nature of real-world data. This paper presents BiCarFormer: the first multimodal approach to multi-label sequence classification of error codes into error patterns that integrates DTC sequences and environmental conditions. BiCarFormer is a bidirectional Transformer model tailored for vehicle event sequences, employing embedding fusions and a co-attention mechanism to capture the relationships between diagnostic codes and environmental data. Experimental results on a challenging real-world automotive dataset with 22,137 error codes and 360 error patterns demonstrate that our approach significantly improves classification performance compared to models that rely solely on DTC sequences and traditional sequence models.

This persistence of memories, e.g., the user is vegetarian, can enhance personalization in future conversations. However, the same persistence can also introduce safety risks that have been largely overlooked. Hence, we introduce PersistBench to measure the extent of these safety risks. We identify two long-term memory-specific risks: cross-domain leakage, where LLMs inappropriately inject context from the long-term memories; and memory-induced sycophancy, where stored long-term memories insidiously reinforce user biases.

Automotive manufacturers use Boolean combinations of these codes, called error patterns (EPs), to characterize system faults and ensure vehicle safety. Yet, EP rules are still manually handcrafted by domain experts, a process that is expensive and prone to errors as vehicle complexity grows. This paper introduces CAREP (Causal Automated Reasoning for Error Patterns), a multi-agent system that automatizes the generation of EP rules from high-dimensional event sequences of DTCs. CAREP combines a causal discovery agent that identifies potential DTC-EP relations, a contextual information agent that integrates metadata and descriptions, and an orchestrator agent that synthesizes candidate boolean rules together with interpretable reasoning traces. Evaluation on a large-scale automotive dataset with over 29,100 unique DTCs and 474 error patterns demonstrates that CAREP can automatically and accurately discover the unknown EP rules, outperforming LLM-only baselines while providing transparent causal explanations. By uniting practical causal discovery and agent-based reasoning, CAREP represents a step toward fully automated fault diagnostics, enabling scalable, interpretable, and cost-efficient vehicle maintenance.", "AI": {"tldr": "CAREP\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u56e0\u679c\u53d1\u73b0\u548c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4fe1\u606f\u81ea\u52a8\u4ece\u8f66\u8f86\u8bca\u65ad\u6545\u969c\u4ee3\u7801(DTCs)\u4e2d\u751f\u6210\u9519\u8bef\u6a21\u5f0f(EP)\u89c4\u5219\uff0c\u66ff\u4ee3\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e13\u5bb6\u624b\u5de5\u5236\u5b9a\u89c4\u5219\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u4ee3\u8f66\u8f86\u4ea7\u751f\u6570\u5343\u79cd\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u8bca\u65ad\u6545\u969c\u4ee3\u7801\uff0c\u6c7d\u8f66\u5236\u9020\u5546\u4f7f\u7528\u8fd9\u4e9b\u4ee3\u7801\u7684\u5e03\u5c14\u7ec4\u5408\uff08\u9519\u8bef\u6a21\u5f0f\uff09\u6765\u8868\u5f81\u7cfb\u7edf\u6545\u969c\u5e76\u786e\u4fdd\u8f66\u8f86\u5b89\u5168\u3002\u7136\u800c\uff0cEP\u89c4\u5219\u4ecd\u7136\u7531\u9886\u57df\u4e13\u5bb6\u624b\u5de5\u5236\u5b9a\uff0c\u968f\u7740\u8f66\u8f86\u590d\u6742\u6027\u7684\u589e\u52a0\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e00\u8fc7\u7a0b\u65e2\u6602\u8d35\u53c8\u5bb9\u6613\u51fa\u9519\u3002", "method": "CAREP\u91c7\u7528\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u67b6\u6784\uff1a1)\u56e0\u679c\u53d1\u73b0\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u8bc6\u522b\u6f5c\u5728\u7684DTC-EP\u5173\u7cfb\uff1b2)\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4fe1\u606f\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6574\u5408\u5143\u6570\u636e\u548c\u63cf\u8ff0\u4fe1\u606f\uff1b3)\u7f16\u6392\u5668\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5408\u6210\u5019\u9009\u5e03\u5c14\u89c4\u5219\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5305\u542b29,100\u4e2a\u72ec\u7279DTCs\u548c474\u4e2a\u9519\u8bef\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6c7d\u8f66\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\u8868\u660e\uff0cCAREP\u80fd\u591f\u81ea\u52a8\u4e14\u51c6\u786e\u5730\u53d1\u73b0\u672a\u77e5\u7684EP\u89c4\u5219\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528LLM\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u4f9b\u900f\u660e\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u89e3\u91ca\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u7ed3\u5408\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u53d1\u73b0\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u63a8\u7406\uff0cCAREP\u4ee3\u8868\u4e86\u5411\u5b8c\u5168\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u6545\u969c\u8bca\u65ad\u8fc8\u51fa\u7684\u4e00\u6b65\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u4e14\u6210\u672c\u6548\u76ca\u9ad8\u7684\u8f66\u8f86\u7ef4\u62a4\u3002"}}

An Empirical Study of Task-Interfering Layers in Vision-Language Models", "comment": null, "summary": "Current VLMs have demonstrated capabilities across a wide range of multimodal tasks. Typically, in a pretrained VLM, all layers are engaged by default to make predictions on downstream tasks. We find that intervening on a single layer, such as by zeroing its parameters, can improve the performance on certain tasks, indicating that some layers hinder rather than help downstream tasks. We systematically investigate how individual layers influence different tasks via layer intervention. Specifically, we measure the change in performance relative to the base model after intervening on each layer and observe improvements when bypassing specific layers. This improvement can be generalizable across models and datasets, indicating the presence of Task-Interfering Layers that harm downstream tasks' performance. We introduce Task-Layer Interaction Vector, which quantifies the effect of intervening on each layer of a VLM given a task. These task-interfering layers exhibit task-specific sensitivity patterns: tasks requiring similar capabilities show consistent response trends under layer interventions, as evidenced by the high similarity in their task-layer interaction vectors. Inspired by these findings, we propose TaLo (Task-Adaptive Layer Knockout), a training-free, test-time adaptation method that dynamically identifies and bypasses the most interfering layer for a given task. Without parameter updates, TaLo improves performance across various models and datasets, including boosting Qwen-VL's accuracy on the Maps task in ScienceQA by up to 16.6%. Our work reveals an unexpected form of modularity in pretrained VLMs and provides a plug-and-play, training-free mechanism to unlock hidden capabilities at inference time.

It provides systematic coverage of ASP features, including choice rules, aggregates, and optimization. Each problem includes reference validators that check whether solutions satisfy the problem specification.\n  We characterize problems along seven largely independent reasoning aspects (optimization, temporal reasoning, default logic, resource allocation, recursion, spatial reasoning, and quantitative complexity), providing a multidimensional view of modeling difficulty.\n  We test the benchmark using an agentic approach based on the ReAct (Reason and Act) framework, which achieves full saturation, demonstrating that feedback-driven iterative refinement with solver feedback provides a reliable and robust approach for modeling natural language in ASP.

Although AutoML methods for classification are able to deal with data imperfections, such as outliers, multiple scales and missing data, their behavior is less known on dirty categorical datasets. These datasets often have several categorical features with high cardinality arising from issues such as lack of curation and automated collection. Recent research has shown that ML models can benefit from morphological encoders for dirty categorical data, leading to significantly superior predictive performance. However the effects of using such encoders in AutoML methods are not known at the moment. In this paper, we propose a pipeline that transforms categorical data into numerical data so that an AutoML can handle categorical data transformed by more advanced encoding schemes. We benchmark the current robustness of AutoML methods on a set of dirty datasets and compare it with the proposed pipeline. This allows us to get insight on differences in predictive performance. We also look at the ML pipelines built by AutoMLs in order to gain insight beyond the best model as typically returned by these methods.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u5c06\u5206\u7c7b\u6570\u636e\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u6570\u503c\u6570\u636e\u7684\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u4f7fAutoML\u80fd\u591f\u5904\u7406\u7ecf\u8fc7\u66f4\u9ad8\u7ea7\u7f16\u7801\u65b9\u6848\u8f6c\u6362\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u810f\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30AutoML\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u867d\u7136AutoML\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u80fd\u591f\u5904\u7406\u6570\u636e\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u4e8e\u810f\u5206\u7c7b\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08\u5177\u6709\u9ad8\u57fa\u6570\u5206\u7c7b\u7279\u5f81\uff09\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u4e86\u89e3\u8f83\u5c11\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\u5f62\u6001\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u810f\u5206\u7c7b\u6570\u636e\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u5728AutoML\u4e2d\u7684\u6548\u679c\u5c1a\u4e0d\u660e\u786e\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u5c06\u5206\u7c7b\u6570\u636e\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u6570\u503c\u6570\u636e\u7684\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u4f7fAutoML\u80fd\u591f\u5904\u7406\u7ecf\u8fc7\u9ad8\u7ea7\u7f16\u7801\u65b9\u6848\u8f6c\u6362\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u6570\u636e\u3002\u5728\u810f\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5bf9AutoML\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u8fdb\u884c\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u5e76\u4e0e\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u7ba1\u9053\u8fdb\u884c\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6bd4\u8f83\u5206\u6790\u83b7\u5f97\u4e86\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u5f02\u7684\u6d1e\u5bdf\uff0c\u5e76\u6df1\u5165\u7814\u7a76\u4e86AutoML\u6784\u5efa\u7684ML\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e9b\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u8fd4\u56de\u7684\u6700\u4f73\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3aAutoML\u5728\u810f\u5206\u7c7b\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u7ba1\u9053\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u6df1\u5165\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u7f16\u7801\u65b9\u6848\u5bf9AutoML\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u7406\u89e3AutoML\u5728\u5904\u7406\u590d\u6742\u5206\u7c7b\u6570\u636e\u65f6\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u3002"}}

Existing studies usually enhance the reasoning efficiency of LLMs by compressing CoT sequences. However, this approach conflicts with test-time scaling, limiting the reasoning capacity of LLMs. In this paper, we propose an efficient reasoning framework that models the reasoning process of LLMs as a state-transition process. Specifically, we first apply a linear attention mechanism to estimate the LLM's reasoning state, which records the historical reasoning information from previous reasoning steps. Then, based on the query prompt and the reasoning state, the LLM can efficiently perform the current reasoning step and update the state. With the linear attention, each token in the current reasoning step can directly retrieve relevant historical reasoning information from the reasoning state, without explicitly attending to tokens in previous reasoning steps. In this way, the computational complexity of attention is reduced from quadratic to linear, significantly improving the reasoning efficiency of LLMs. In addition, we propose a state-based reasoning strategy to mitigate the over-thinking issue caused by noisy reasoning steps.

Existing batch correction approaches either insufficiently correct batch effects or require centralized retraining on the complete dataset, limiting their applicability in distributed and continually evolving single-cell data settings. We introduce scBatchProx, a post-hoc optimization method inspired by federated learning principles for refining cell-level embeddings produced by arbitrary upstream methods. Treating each batch as a client, scBatchProx learns batch-conditioned adapters under proximal regularization, correcting batch structure directly in latent space without requiring raw expression data or centralized optimization.

In this paper, we present Workflow-R1, a framework that reformulates workflow construction as a multi-turn, natural language-based sequential decision-making process. To resolve the optimization granularity mismatch inherent in such multi-turn interactions, we introduce Group Sub-sequence Policy Optimization (GSsPO). While explicitly tailored to align with the interleaved Think-Action dynamics of agentic reasoning, GSsPO fundamentally functions as a structure-aware RL algorithm generalizable to a broad class of multi-turn agentic sequential decision-making tasks. By recalibrating the optimization unit to the composite sub-sequence, specifically the atomic Think-Action cycle, it aligns gradient updates with the semantic boundaries of these interactions, ensuring robust learning in complex multi-turn reasoning tasks.

Policy-gradient reinforcement learning (RL) provides a principled mechanism for aligning generative models with downstream objectives but typically requires access to the score, which has prevented its application to flow-based models that learn only velocity fields. We introduce Open Materials Generation with Inference-time Reinforcement Learning (OMatG-IRL), a policy-gradient RL framework that operates directly on the learned velocity fields and eliminates the need for the explicit computation of the score. OMatG-IRL leverages stochastic perturbations of the underlying generation dynamics preserving the baseline performance of the pretrained generative model while enabling exploration and policy-gradient estimation at inference time. Using OMatG-IRL, we present the first application of RL to crystal structure prediction (CSP). Our method enables effective reinforcement of an energy-based objective while preserving diversity through composition conditioning, and it achieves performance competitive with score-based RL approaches.

This review article provides a concise mathematical reference for researchers seeking an explicit, equation-level description of LLM training, alignment, and generation. We formulate LLMs as high-dimensional nonlinear autoregressive models with attention-based dependencies. The framework encompasses pretraining via next-token prediction, alignment methods such as reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF), direct preference optimization (DPO), rejection sampling fine-tuning (RSFT), and reinforcement learning from verifiable rewards (RLVR), as well as autoregressive generation during inference. Self-attention emerges naturally as a repeated bilinear--softmax--linear composition, yielding highly expressive sequence models. This formulation enables principled analysis of alignment-induced behaviors (including sycophancy), inference-time phenomena (such as hallucination, in-context learning, chain-of-thought prompting, and retrieval-augmented generation), and extensions like continual learning, while serving as a concise reference for interpretation and further theoretical development.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u6570\u5b66\u516c\u5f0f\u7684\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLM\uff09\u7edf\u4e00\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u8bad\u7ec3\u3001\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5c06LLM\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u4e3a\u5177\u6709\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u9ad8\u7ef4\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63cf\u8ff0\u901a\u5e38\u57fa\u4e8e\u67b6\u6784\u7ec4\u4ef6\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u660e\u786e\u7684\u6570\u5b66\u516c\u5f0f\u5316\u8868\u8fbe\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u4e3a\u7814\u7a76\u4eba\u5458\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e00\u4e2a\u7b80\u6d01\u7684\u6570\u5b66\u53c2\u8003\uff0c\u7528\u65b9\u7a0b\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u63cf\u8ff0\u6765\u9610\u660eLLM\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u3001\u5bf9\u9f50\u548c\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "method": "\u5c06LLM\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u4e3a\u9ad8\u7ef4\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u88ab\u63cf\u8ff0\u4e3a\u91cd\u590d\u7684\u53cc\u7ebf\u6027-softmax-\u7ebf\u6027\u7ec4\u5408\u3002\u6846\u67b6\u6db5\u76d6\uff1a1\uff09\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e0b\u4e00\u8bcd\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\uff1b2\uff09\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08RLHF\u3001DPO\u3001RSFT\u3001RLVR\uff09\uff1b3\uff09\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u7684\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u751f\u6210\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u6570\u5b66\u6846\u67b6\u80fd\u591f\u5bf9\u5bf9\u9f50\u8bf1\u5bfc\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\uff08\u5982\u5949\u627f\uff09\u3001\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u73b0\u8c61\uff08\u5982\u5e7b\u89c9\u3001\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u3001\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u63d0\u793a\u3001\u68c0\u7d22\u589e\u5f3a\u751f\u6210\uff09\u4ee5\u53ca\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u7b49\u6269\u5c55\u8fdb\u884c\u539f\u7406\u6027\u5206\u6790\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7b80\u6d01\u7684\u6570\u5b66\u53c2\u8003\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06LLM\u7edf\u4e00\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\uff0c\u4fbf\u4e8e\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u548c\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4e3a\u89e3\u91caLLM\u884c\u4e3a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

However, they often struggle with complex, knowledge-intensive tasks that require structured reasoning and effective retrieval. To address these limitations, we propose FutureMind, a modular reasoning framework that equips SLMs with strategic thinking-pattern priors via adaptive knowledge distillation from large language models (LLMs). FutureMind introduces a dynamic reasoning pipeline composed of four key modules: Problem Analysis, Logical Reasoning, Strategy Planning, and Retrieval Guidance. This pipeline is augmented by three distinct retrieval paradigms that decompose complex queries into tractable subproblems, ensuring efficient and accurate retrieval execution. Extensive experiments on multi-hop QA benchmarks, including 2WikiMultihopQA, MuSiQue, Bamboogle, and Frames, demonstrate the superiority of FutureMind. It consistently outperforms strong baselines such as Search-o1, achieving state-of-the-art results under free training conditions across diverse SLM architectures and scales. Beyond empirical gains, our analysis reveals that the process of thinking-pattern distillation is restricted by the cognitive bias bottleneck between the teacher (LLMs) and student (SLMs) models.

While personalization on private data is increasingly vital, traditional Reinforcement Learning (RL) alignment is often memory-prohibitive for on-device federated learning due to the overhead of maintaining a separate critic network. GRPO's critic-free architecture enables feasible on-device training, yet transitioning to a federated setting introduces systemic challenges: heterogeneous reward definitions, imbalanced multi-objective optimization, and high training costs. We propose FedMOA, a federated GRPO framework for multi-objective alignment under heterogeneous rewards. FedMOA stabilizes local training through an online adaptive weighting mechanism via hypergradient descent, which prioritizes primary reasoning as auxiliary objectives saturate. On the server side, it utilizes a task- and accuracy-aware aggregation strategy to prioritize high-quality updates.

However, the construction of their underlying ontologies remains a resource-intensive, manual process that relies heavily on domain expertise. This paper introduces OntoEKG, a LLM-driven pipeline designed to accelerate the generation of domain-specific ontologies from unstructured enterprise data. Our approach decomposes the modelling task into two distinct phases: an extraction module that identifies core classes and properties, and an entailment module that logically structures these elements into a hierarchy before serialising them into standard RDF. Addressing the significant lack of comprehensive benchmarks for end-to-end ontology construction, we adopt a new evaluation dataset derived from documents across the Data, Finance, and Logistics sectors. Experimental results highlight both the potential and the challenges of this approach, achieving a fuzzy-match F1-score of 0.724 in the Data domain while revealing limitations in scope definition and hierarchical reasoning.", "AI": {"tldr": "OntoEKG\uff1a\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u4ece\u975e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u4f01\u4e1a\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u52a0\u901f\u751f\u6210\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u672c\u4f53\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u53d6\u548c\u8574\u542b\u4e24\u4e2a\u6a21\u5757\u5b9e\u73b0\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u672c\u4f53\u6784\u5efa\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f01\u4e1a\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u5bf9\u4e8e\u7edf\u4e00\u5f02\u6784\u6570\u636e\u548c\u5b9e\u65bd\u8bed\u4e49\u6cbb\u7406\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u5e95\u5c42\u672c\u4f53\u7684\u6784\u5efa\u4ecd\u7136\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u8d44\u6e90\u5bc6\u96c6\u3001\u4f9d\u8d56\u9886\u57df\u4e13\u4e1a\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u7e41\u7410\u4eba\u5de5\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u5efa\u6a21\u4efb\u52a1\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u4e24\u4e2a\u9636\u6bb5\uff1a\u63d0\u53d6\u6a21\u5757\u8bc6\u522b\u6838\u5fc3\u7c7b\u548c\u5c5e\u6027\uff0c\u8574\u542b\u6a21\u5757\u5c06\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5143\u7d20\u903b\u8f91\u5730\u7ec4\u7ec7\u6210\u5c42\u6b21\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u5e8f\u5217\u5316\u4e3a\u6807\u51c6RDF\u683c\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "\u5728Data\u9886\u57df\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6a21\u7cca\u5339\u914dF1\u5206\u65700.724\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u8303\u56f4\u5b9a\u4e49\u548c\u5c42\u6b21\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c55\u793a\u4e86LLM\u9a71\u52a8\u672c\u4f53\u6784\u5efa\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u4e5f\u6307\u51fa\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8303\u56f4\u5b9a\u4e49\u548c\u5c42\u6b21\u63a8\u7406\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u4f01\u4e1a\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u672c\u4f53\u6784\u5efa\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u601d\u8def\u3002"}}

In such settings, single-agent systems are vulnerable to self-reinforcing errors, as their predictions lack independent validation and can drift toward spurious conclusions. Although recent multi-agent frameworks attempt to mitigate this issue through collaborative reasoning, their interactions are often shallow and loosely structured, failing to reflect the rigorous, evidence-driven processes used by clinical experts. More fundamentally, existing approaches largely ignore the rich logical dependencies among diseases, such as mutual exclusivity, pathological compatibility, and diagnostic confusion. This limitation prevents them from ruling out clinically implausible hypotheses, even when sufficient evidence is available. To overcome these, we propose RE-MCDF, a relation-enhanced multi-expert clinical diagnosis framework. RE-MCDF introduces a generation--verification--revision closed-loop architecture that integrates three complementary components: (i) a primary expert that generates candidate diagnoses and supporting evidence, (ii) a laboratory expert that dynamically prioritizes heterogeneous clinical indicators, and (iii) a multi-relation awareness and evaluation expert group that explicitly enforces inter-disease logical constraints. Guided by a medical knowledge graph (MKG), the first two experts adaptively reweight EMR evidence, while the expert group validates and corrects candidate diagnoses to ensure logical consistency. Extensive experiments on the neurology subset of CMEMR (NEEMRs) and on our curated dataset (XMEMRs) demonstrate that RE-MCDF consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in complex diagnostic scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "RE-MCDF\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5173\u7cfb\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u591a\u4e13\u5bb6\u4e34\u5e8a\u8bca\u65ad\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u751f\u6210-\u9a8c\u8bc1-\u4fee\u8ba2\u7684\u95ed\u73af\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u533b\u5b66\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u795e\u7ecf\u79d1\u7535\u5b50\u75c5\u5386\u7684\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u3001\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u548c\u566a\u58f0\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u8bca\u65ad\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u795e\u7ecf\u79d1\u7535\u5b50\u75c5\u5386\u5177\u6709\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u3001\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u548c\u566a\u58f0\uff0c\u5355\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\u5bb9\u6613\u4ea7\u751f\u81ea\u6211\u5f3a\u5316\u7684\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6846\u67b6\u4ea4\u4e92\u6d45\u5c42\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u75be\u75c5\u95f4\u7684\u4e30\u5bcc\u903b\u8f91\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6392\u9664\u4e34\u5e8a\u4e0d\u53ef\u4fe1\u7684\u5047\u8bbe\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faRE-MCDF\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u751f\u6210-\u9a8c\u8bc1-\u4fee\u8ba2\u95ed\u73af\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e09\u4e2a\u4e92\u8865\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff1a1\uff09\u751f\u6210\u5019\u9009\u8bca\u65ad\u548c\u652f\u6301\u8bc1\u636e\u7684\u4e3b\u4e13\u5bb6\uff1b2\uff09\u52a8\u6001\u4f18\u5148\u5904\u7406\u5f02\u8d28\u4e34\u5e8a\u6307\u6807\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5ba4\u4e13\u5bb6\uff1b3\uff09\u5f3a\u5236\u6267\u884c\u75be\u75c5\u95f4\u903b\u8f91\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u591a\u5173\u7cfb\u611f\u77e5\u4e0e\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e13\u5bb6\u7ec4\u3002\u6846\u67b6\u57fa\u4e8e\u533b\u5b66\u77e5\u8bc6\u56fe\u8c31\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u91cd\u65b0\u52a0\u6743\u7535\u5b50\u75c5\u5386\u8bc1\u636e\u3002", "result": "\u5728CMEMR\u795e\u7ecf\u5b66\u5b50\u96c6\uff08NEEMRs\uff09\u548c\u81ea\u5efa\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08XMEMRs\uff09\u4e0a\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cRE-MCDF\u5728\u590d\u6742\u8bca\u65ad\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u6301\u7eed\u4f18\u4e8e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "RE-MCDF\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u591a\u4e13\u5bb6\u534f\u4f5c\u548c\u663e\u5f0f\u75be\u75c5\u5173\u7cfb\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u795e\u7ecf\u79d1\u7535\u5b50\u75c5\u5386\u8bca\u65ad\u4e2d\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u8bca\u65ad\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u903b\u8f91\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002"}}

However, using them for planning can be challenging due to the vast and unstructured search space. We propose a robust and highly parallelizable planner that leverages the differentiability of the learned world model for efficient optimization, solving long-horizon control tasks from visual input. Our method treats states as optimization variables (\"virtual states\") with soft dynamics constraints, enabling parallel computation and easier optimization. To facilitate exploration and avoid local optima, we introduce stochasticity into the states. To mitigate sensitive gradients through high-dimensional vision-based world models, we modify the gradient structure to descend towards valid plans while only requiring action-input gradients. Our planner, which we call GRASP (Gradient RelAxed Stochastic Planner), can be viewed as a stochastic version of a non-condensed or collocation-based optimal controller. We provide theoretical justification and experiments on video-based world models, where our resulting planner outperforms existing planning algorithms like the cross-entropy method (CEM) and vanilla gradient-based optimization (GD) on long-horizon experiments, both in success rate and time to convergence.", "AI": {"tldr": "GRASP\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u53ef\u5fae\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5e76\u884c\u5316\u89c4\u5212\u5668\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u72b6\u6001\u89c6\u4e3a\u4f18\u5316\u53d8\u91cf\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u968f\u673a\u6027\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u89c6\u89c9\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u957f\u65f6\u57df\u63a7\u5236\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "motivation": "\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u4ee5\u4ece\u539f\u59cb\u611f\u5b98\u8f93\u5165\uff08\u5982\u89c6\u9891\uff09\u6a21\u62df\u73af\u5883\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u4f46\u7528\u4e8e\u89c4\u5212\u65f6\u9762\u4e34\u641c\u7d22\u7a7a\u95f4\u5e9e\u5927\u4e14\u975e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u89c4\u5212\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5904\u7406\u957f\u65f6\u57df\u89c6\u89c9\u63a7\u5236\u4efb\u52a1\u65f6\u6548\u7387\u6709\u9650\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faGRASP\u89c4\u5212\u5668\uff1a1) \u5c06\u72b6\u6001\u89c6\u4e3a\u4f18\u5316\u53d8\u91cf\uff08\"\u865a\u62df\u72b6\u6001\"\uff09\u5e76\u65bd\u52a0\u8f6f\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7ea6\u675f\uff1b2) \u5f15\u5165\u72b6\u6001\u968f\u673a\u6027\u4ee5\u4fc3\u8fdb\u63a2\u7d22\u548c\u907f\u514d\u5c40\u90e8\u6700\u4f18\uff1b3) \u4fee\u6539\u68af\u5ea6\u7ed3\u6784\u4ee5\u7f13\u89e3\u9ad8\u7ef4\u89c6\u89c9\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u654f\u611f\u68af\u5ea6\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4ec5\u9700\u52a8\u4f5c\u8f93\u5165\u68af\u5ea6\uff1b4) \u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u5ea6\u5e76\u884c\u5316\u8ba1\u7b97\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c6\u9891\u7684\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0cGRASP\u5728\u957f\u65f6\u57df\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u4ea4\u53c9\u71b5\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08CEM\uff09\u548c\u666e\u901a\u68af\u5ea6\u4f18\u5316\uff08GD\uff09\uff0c\u5728\u6210\u529f\u7387\u548c\u6536\u655b\u65f6\u95f4\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\u3002", "conclusion": "GRASP\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u79cd\u968f\u673a\u5316\u7684\u975e\u51dd\u805a\u6216\u914d\u70b9\u6700\u4f18\u63a7\u5236\u5668\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u53ef\u5fae\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u9ad8\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u89c6\u89c9\u8f93\u5165\u7684\u957f\u65f6\u57df\u63a7\u5236\u89c4\u5212\u95ee\u9898\u3002"}}

Previous work has shown that a linear classifier trained on a contrastive instruction pair and a simple dataset can achieve good performance. However, these probes exhibit notable failures even in straightforward scenarios, including spurious correlations and false positives on non-deceptive responses. In this paper, we identify the importance of the instruction pair used during training. Furthermore, we show that targeting specific deceptive behaviors through a human-interpretable taxonomy of deception leads to improved results on evaluation datasets. Our findings reveal that instruction pairs capture deceptive intent rather than content-specific patterns, explaining why prompt choice dominates probe performance (70.6% of variance). Given the heterogeneity of deception types across datasets, we conclude that organizations should design specialized probes targeting their specific threat models rather than seeking a universal deception detector.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7ebf\u6027\u63a2\u9488\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u76d1\u6d4bAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u6b3a\u9a97\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u865a\u5047\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u548c\u8bef\u62a5\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u6307\u4ee4\u5bf9\u9009\u62e9\u5bf9\u63a2\u9488\u6027\u80fd\u5f71\u54cd\u6700\u5927\uff08\u536070.6%\u65b9\u5dee\uff09\uff0c\u4e14\u9488\u5bf9\u7279\u5b9a\u6b3a\u9a97\u7c7b\u578b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63a2\u9488\u6bd4\u5bfb\u6c42\u901a\u7528\u6b3a\u9a97\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7ebf\u6027\u63a2\u9488\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u68c0\u6d4bAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u6b3a\u9a97\u884c\u4e3a\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u660e\u663e\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u865a\u5047\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u548c\u5bf9\u975e\u6b3a\u9a97\u6027\u54cd\u5e94\u7684\u8bef\u62a5\u3002\u9700\u8981\u6539\u8fdb\u63a2\u9488\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u68c0\u6d4b\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u6307\u4ee4\u5bf9\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8e\u4eba\u7c7b\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u6b3a\u9a97\u5206\u7c7b\u6cd5\uff0c\u9488\u5bf9\u7279\u5b9a\u6b3a\u9a97\u884c\u4e3a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e13\u95e8\u7684\u63a2\u9488\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u6307\u4ee4\u5bf9\u6355\u83b7\u7684\u662f\u6b3a\u9a97\u610f\u56fe\u800c\u975e\u5185\u5bb9\u7279\u5b9a\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "\u6307\u4ee4\u5bf9\u9009\u62e9\u5bf9\u63a2\u9488\u6027\u80fd\u5f71\u54cd\u6700\u5927\uff0c\u89e3\u91ca\u4e8670.6%\u7684\u65b9\u5dee\u3002\u9488\u5bf9\u7279\u5b9a\u6b3a\u9a97\u7c7b\u578b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u63a2\u9488\u5728\u8bc4\u4f30\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\u3002\u4e0d\u540c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u6b3a\u9a97\u7c7b\u578b\u5177\u6709\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ec4\u7ec7\u5e94\u9488\u5bf9\u5176\u7279\u5b9a\u5a01\u80c1\u6a21\u578b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e13\u95e8\u7684\u63a2\u9488\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u5bfb\u6c42\u901a\u7528\u7684\u6b3a\u9a97\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u3002\u6307\u4ee4\u5bf9\u9009\u62e9\u662f\u63a2\u9488\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5173\u952e\u56e0\u7d20\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u5b83\u6355\u83b7\u7684\u662f\u6b3a\u9a97\u610f\u56fe\u800c\u975e\u5177\u4f53\u5185\u5bb9\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002"}}

This paradigm has stimulated significant research interest and demonstrated practical utility in domains including robot control, creative design, and adversarial sample generation. A variety of QD algorithms with distinct design principles have been proposed in recent years. Instead of proposing a new QD algorithm, this work introduces a novel reformulation by casting the QD optimization as a multi-objective optimization (MOO) problem with a huge number of optimization objectives. By establishing this connection, we enable the direct adoption of well-established MOO methods, particularly set-based scalarization techniques, to solve QD problems through a collaborative search process. We further provide a theoretical analysis demonstrating that our approach inherits theoretical guarantees from MOO while providing desirable properties for the QD optimization.

In contrast, real-world software development is organized as a collaborative activity carried out by teams following shared methodologies, with clear role separation, communication, and review. In this work, we present a fully automated multi-agent system that explicitly models software engineering as an organizational process, replicating the structure of an engineering team. Built on top of agyn, an open-source platform for configuring agent teams, our system assigns specialized agents to roles such as coordination, research, implementation, and review, provides them with isolated sandboxes for experimentation, and enables structured communication. The system follows a defined development methodology for working on issues, including analysis, task specification, pull request creation, and iterative review, and operates without any human intervention. Importantly, the system was designed for real production use and was not tuned for SWE-bench. When evaluated post hoc on SWE-bench 500, it resolves 72.4% of tasks, outperforming single-agent baselines using comparable language models. Our results suggest that replicating team structure, methodology, and communication is a powerful paradigm for autonomous software engineering, and that future progress may depend as much on organizational design and agent infrastructure as on model improvements.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u5b8c\u5168\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5c06\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u7ec4\u7ec7\u5316\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u6a21\u62df\u771f\u5b9e\u5de5\u7a0b\u56e2\u961f\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5728SWE-bench 500\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b072.4%\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u89e3\u51b3\u7387\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u5355\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u5927\u591a\u6570\u81ea\u4e3b\u7cfb\u7edf\u5c06\u95ee\u9898\u89e3\u51b3\u89c6\u4e3a\u5355\u4e00\u6216\u6d41\u6c34\u7ebf\u5f0f\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u5b9e\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5f00\u53d1\u662f\u56e2\u961f\u534f\u4f5c\u6d3b\u52a8\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u660e\u786e\u7684\u89d2\u8272\u5206\u79bb\u3001\u6c9f\u901a\u548c\u5ba1\u67e5\u3002\u9700\u8981\u6a21\u62df\u771f\u5b9e\u5de5\u7a0b\u56e2\u961f\u7684\u7ec4\u7ec7\u7ed3\u6784\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u81ea\u4e3b\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8eagyn\u5f00\u6e90\u5e73\u53f0\u6784\u5efa\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5206\u914d\u4e13\u95e8\u89d2\u8272\uff08\u534f\u8c03\u3001\u7814\u7a76\u3001\u5b9e\u73b0\u3001\u5ba1\u67e5\uff09\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u9694\u79bb\u6c99\u7bb1\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u901a\u4fe1\u3002\u7cfb\u7edf\u9075\u5faa\u5b9a\u4e49\u597d\u7684\u5f00\u53d1\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b66\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u95ee\u9898\u5206\u6790\u3001\u4efb\u52a1\u89c4\u8303\u3001PR\u521b\u5efa\u548c\u8fed\u4ee3\u5ba1\u67e5\uff0c\u5b8c\u5168\u65e0\u9700\u4eba\u5de5\u5e72\u9884\u3002", "result": "\u5728SWE-bench 500\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u89e3\u51b3\u4e8672.4%\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f7f\u7528\u53ef\u6bd4\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5355\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e13\u4e3a\u5b9e\u9645\u751f\u4ea7\u4f7f\u7528\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u672a\u9488\u5bf9SWE-bench\u8fdb\u884c\u8c03\u4f18\u3002", "conclusion": "\u590d\u5236\u56e2\u961f\u7ed3\u6784\u3001\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b66\u548c\u6c9f\u901a\u662f\u81ea\u4e3b\u8f6f\u4ef6\u5de5\u7a0b\u7684\u6709\u529b\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u672a\u6765\u8fdb\u5c55\u53ef\u80fd\u540c\u6837\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u7ec4\u7ec7\u8bbe\u8ba1\u548c\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u4ec5\u662f\u6a21\u578b\u6539\u8fdb\u3002"}}

Existing RL frameworks usually process these sequences independently, repeatedly recomputing identical prefixes during forward and backward passes during policy model training, leading to substantial inefficiencies in computation and memory usage. Although prefix sharing naturally induces a tree structure over rollouts, prior tree-attention-based solutions rely on fully materialized attention masks and scale poorly in RL settings. In this paper, we introduce AREAL-DTA to efficiently exploit prefix sharing in RL training. AREAL-DTA employs a depth-first-search (DFS)-based execution strategy that dynamically traverses the rollout prefix tree during both forward and backward computation, materializing only a single root-to-leaf path at a time. To further improve scalability, AREAL-DTA incorporates a load-balanced distributed batching mechanism that dynamically constructs and processes prefix trees across multiple GPUs.

We introduce NOVA, a NOn-contrastive Vision-language Alignment framework based on joint embedding prediction with distributional regularization. NOVA aligns visual representations to a frozen, domain-specific text encoder by predicting text embeddings from augmented image views, while enforcing an isotropic Gaussian structure via Sketched Isotropic Gaussian Regularization (SIGReg). This eliminates the need for negative sampling, momentum encoders, or stop-gradients, reducing the training objective to a single hyperparameter. We evaluate NOVA on zeroshot chest X-ray classification using ClinicalBERT as the text encoder and Vision Transformers trained from scratch on MIMIC-CXR. On zero-shot classification across three benchmark datasets, NOVA outperforms multiple standard baselines while exhibiting substantially more consistent training runs.

Our prior work has shown the feasibility of reconstructing 3D brain volumes from 2D dissection photographs. However these outputs sometimes exhibit coarse, overly smooth reconstructions of structures, especially under high anisotropy (i.e., reconstructions from thick slabs). Here, we introduce a computationally efficient super-resolution step that imputes slices to generate anatomically consistent isotropic volumes from anisotropic 3D reconstructions of dissection photographs. By training on domain-randomized synthetic data, we ensure that our method generalizes across dissection protocols and remains robust to large slab thicknesses. The imputed volumes yield improved automated segmentations, achieving higher Dice scores, particularly in cortical and white matter regions. Validation on surface reconstruction and atlas registration tasks demonstrates more accurate cortical surfaces and MRI registration. By enhancing the resolution and anatomical fidelity of photograph-based reconstructions, our approach strengthens the bridge between neuropathology and neuroimaging.

Despite their widespread use, implementing them efficiently over large vocabularies remains a significant challenge. Existing approaches often rely on sorting, which incur significant computation and memory overhead on GPUs, or stochastic approaches, which alter the algorithm output. In this work, we propose Qrita, an efficient Top-k and Top-p algorithm based on a pivot-based selection strategy. Based on RTop-k, which uses a pivot-based search for node selection in graph neural networks, Qrita extends the concept of pivot-based search to both Top-k and Top-p with two key techniques: 1. Gaussian-based sigma-truncation, which greatly reduces the search space of the target elements, and 2. Quaternary pivot search with duplication handling, which halves the pivot search iteration and guarantees deterministic output. We provide the full implementation of Qrita using Triton, a popular GPU programming language. Our evaluation of Qrita against the Top-k and Top-p kernels of high performance LLM execution engines such as vLLM, SGLang, and Flashinfer show that Qrita achieves up to 2 times throughput and half memory use while providing the same output to the the sorting-based algorithms.", "AI": {"tldr": "Qrita\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u67a2\u8f74\u9009\u62e9\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u9ad8\u6548Top-k\u548cTop-p\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u6392\u5e8f\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728GPU\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b02\u500d\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u548c\u4e00\u534a\u5185\u5b58\u4f7f\u7528\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u8bc1\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u8f93\u51fa\u3002", "motivation": "Top-k\u548cTop-p\u662f\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u91c7\u6837\u4e2d\u7684\u4e3b\u8981\u622a\u65ad\u7b97\u5b50\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8bcd\u6c47\u8868\u4e0a\u9ad8\u6548\u5b9e\u73b0\u4ecd\u7136\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u91cd\u5927\u6311\u6218\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u8981\u4e48\u4f9d\u8d56\u6392\u5e8f\uff08\u5e26\u6765\u663e\u8457\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u5f00\u9500\uff09\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u4f7f\u7528\u968f\u673a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u6539\u53d8\u7b97\u6cd5\u8f93\u51fa\uff09\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8eRTop-k\u7684\u67a2\u8f74\u641c\u7d22\u601d\u60f3\uff0c\u6269\u5c55\u5230Top-k\u548cTop-p\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u79cd\u5173\u952e\u6280\u672f\uff1a1. \u57fa\u4e8e\u9ad8\u65af\u5206\u5e03\u7684sigma\u622a\u65ad\uff0c\u5927\u5e45\u51cf\u5c11\u76ee\u6807\u5143\u7d20\u7684\u641c\u7d22\u7a7a\u95f4\uff1b2. \u56db\u5143\u67a2\u8f74\u641c\u7d22\u4e0e\u91cd\u590d\u5904\u7406\uff0c\u5c06\u67a2\u8f74\u641c\u7d22\u8fed\u4ee3\u51cf\u534a\u5e76\u4fdd\u8bc1\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u8f93\u51fa\u3002\u4f7f\u7528Triton GPU\u7f16\u7a0b\u8bed\u8a00\u5b9e\u73b0\u3002", "result": "\u4e0evLLM\u3001SGLang\u548cFlashinfer\u7b49\u9ad8\u6027\u80fdLLM\u6267\u884c\u5f15\u64ce\u7684Top-k\u548cTop-p\u5185\u6838\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0cQrita\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u8fbe2\u500d\u7684\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u548c\u4e00\u534a\u7684\u5185\u5b58\u4f7f\u7528\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e0e\u57fa\u4e8e\u6392\u5e8f\u7b97\u6cd5\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u8f93\u51fa\u3002", "conclusion": "Qrita\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7684Top-k\u548cTop-p\u5b9e\u73b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728GPU\u4e0a\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u5f00\u9500\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u7b97\u6cd5\u8f93\u51fa\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002"}}

While IIoT enables predictive maintenance and cross-site optimization of modern industrial control systems, such as those in manufacturing and energy, it also introduces significant privacy and confidentiality risks due to the sensitivity of operational data. Contrastive learning, a self-supervised representation learning paradigm, has recently emerged as a promising approach for privacy-preserving analytics by reducing reliance on labeled data and raw data sharing.

In this paper, we introduce \\textbf{MAGIC}, a novel multi-turn multi-agent reinforcement learning framework that formulates LLM safety alignment as an adversarial asymmetric game. Specifically, an attacker agent learns to iteratively rewrite original queries into deceptive prompts, while a defender agent simultaneously optimizes its policy to recognize and refuse such inputs. This dynamic process triggers a \\textbf{co-evolution}, where the attacker's ever-changing strategies continuously uncover long-tail vulnerabilities, driving the defender to generalize to unseen attack patterns. Remarkably, we observe that the attacker, endowed with initial reasoning ability, evolves \\textbf{novel, previously unseen combinatorial strategies} through iterative RL training, underscoring our method's substantial potential. Theoretically, we provide insights into a more robust game equilibrium and derive safety guarantees. Extensive experiments validate our framework's effectiveness, demonstrating superior defense success rates without compromising the helpfulness of the model.

To address these issues, in this work, we propose S1-NexusAgent, a self-evolving agent framework designed for multidisciplinary scientific research. S1-NexusAgent adopts a hierarchical Plan-and-CodeAct execution paradigm, decoupling global scientific planning from subtask-level tool execution through a dual-loop architecture, thereby enabling stable modeling of complex research workflows. The system natively supports the Model Context Protocol (MCP), integrates up to thousands of cross-disciplinary scientific tools, and achieves efficient orchestration of heterogeneous research tools via intention-aware dynamic tool retrieval and hot-plug mechanisms. To address long-context and large-scale data challenges in scientific settings, S1-NexusAgent introduces object-reference-based sparse context management, which enables sub-task context isolation and intermediate result compression. Building on this, a Critic Agent automatically evaluates complete execution trajectories and distills high-quality research paths into reusable Scientific Skills, forming a closed loop for continuous self-evolution, which is valuable for sustainable and long-horizon scientific research. Experiments on authoritative scientific benchmarks involving long-horizon planning and complex specialized tool orchestration, including biomini-eval (biology), ChemBench (chemistry), and MatSciBench (material science), demonstrate that S1-NexusAgent achieves state-of-the-art performance, validating its effectiveness and generalization capability in complex scientific tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "S1-NexusAgent\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7528\u4e8e\u591a\u5b66\u79d1\u79d1\u5b66\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u81ea\u8fdb\u5316\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u5c42\u89c4\u5212-\u4ee3\u7801\u6267\u884c\u8303\u5f0f\u548c\u53cc\u5faa\u73af\u67b6\u6784\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709LLM\u5728\u957f\u7a0b\u89c4\u5212\u3001\u76ee\u6807\u7ef4\u62a4\u548c\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u79d1\u5b66\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709LLM\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5de5\u5177\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5728\u5904\u7406\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u3001\u590d\u6742\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u548c\u4e13\u7528\u5de5\u5177\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u957f\u7a0b\u89c4\u5212\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u76ee\u6807\u7ef4\u62a4\u548c\u4ece\u6267\u884c\u4e2d\u6301\u7eed\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u9762\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u6ee1\u8db3\u73b0\u4ee3\u79d1\u5b66\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u9700\u6c42\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u5206\u5c42Plan-and-CodeAct\u6267\u884c\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u5faa\u73af\u67b6\u6784\u5c06\u5168\u5c40\u79d1\u5b66\u89c4\u5212\u4e0e\u5b50\u4efb\u52a1\u7ea7\u5de5\u5177\u6267\u884c\u89e3\u8026\uff1b\u539f\u751f\u652f\u6301MCP\u534f\u8bae\uff0c\u96c6\u6210\u6570\u5343\u4e2a\u8de8\u5b66\u79d1\u79d1\u5b66\u5de5\u5177\uff1b\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8e\u5bf9\u8c61\u5f15\u7528\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7ba1\u7406\uff1b\u901a\u8fc7Critic Agent\u81ea\u52a8\u8bc4\u4f30\u6267\u884c\u8f68\u8ff9\u5e76\u63d0\u70bc\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u7814\u7a76\u8def\u5f84\u4e3a\u53ef\u91cd\u7528\u79d1\u5b66\u6280\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6d89\u53ca\u957f\u7a0b\u89c4\u5212\u548c\u590d\u6742\u4e13\u7528\u5de5\u5177\u7f16\u6392\u7684\u6743\u5a01\u79d1\u5b66\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff08\u5305\u62ecbiomini-eval\u3001ChemBench\u548cMatSciBench\uff09\u4e2d\uff0cS1-NexusAgent\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u590d\u6742\u79d1\u5b66\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "S1-NexusAgent\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u8fdb\u5316\u6846\u67b6\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u79d1\u5b66\u7814\u7a76\u4e2d\u957f\u7a0b\u89c4\u5212\u3001\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u5904\u7406\u548c\u5de5\u5177\u7f16\u6392\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4e3a\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u548c\u957f\u7a0b\u79d1\u5b66\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u4ef7\u503c\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u5728\u590d\u6742\u79d1\u5b66\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u5353\u8d8a\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

However, most existing systems rely on predefined tasks and fixed prompts, limiting their ability to autonomously identify what problems should be solved when environmental conditions change. In this paper, we propose a human-simulation-based framework that enables AI systems to autonomously form questions and set tasks by reasoning over their internal states, environmental observations, and interactions with other AI systems. The proposed method treats question formation as a first-class decision process preceding task selection and execution, and integrates internal-driven, environment-aware, and inter-agent-aware prompting scopes to progressively expand cognitive coverage. In addition, the framework supports learning the question-formation process from experience, allowing the system to improve its adaptability and decision quality over time. xperimental results in a multi-agent simulation environment show that environment-aware prompting significantly reduces no-eat events compared with the internal-driven baseline, and inter-agent-aware prompting further reduces cumulative no-eat events by more than 60% over a 20-day simulation, with statistically significant improvements (p < 0.05).", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u4eba\u7c7b\u6a21\u62df\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f7fAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u80fd\u901a\u8fc7\u63a8\u7406\u5185\u90e8\u72b6\u6001\u3001\u73af\u5883\u89c2\u5bdf\u548c\u4e0e\u5176\u4ed6AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u6765\u81ea\u4e3b\u5f62\u6210\u95ee\u9898\u548c\u8bbe\u5b9a\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u5c06\u95ee\u9898\u5f62\u6210\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4efb\u52a1\u9009\u62e9\u548c\u6267\u884c\u7684\u4f18\u5148\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524dLLM\u9a71\u52a8\u7684AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u5927\u591a\u4f9d\u8d56\u9884\u5b9a\u4e49\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u56fa\u5b9a\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u5728\u73af\u5883\u6761\u4ef6\u53d8\u5316\u65f6\u7f3a\u4e4f\u81ea\u4e3b\u8bc6\u522b\u5e94\u89e3\u51b3\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5728\u52a8\u6001\u5f00\u653e\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u81ea\u4e3b\u51b3\u7b56\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4eba\u7c7b\u6a21\u62df\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u95ee\u9898\u5f62\u6210\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u7ea7\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u6574\u5408\u5185\u90e8\u9a71\u52a8\u3001\u73af\u5883\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u95f4\u611f\u77e5\u4e09\u79cd\u63d0\u793a\u8303\u56f4\u6765\u9010\u6b65\u6269\u5c55\u8ba4\u77e5\u8986\u76d6\uff0c\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u4ece\u7ecf\u9a8c\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u95ee\u9898\u5f62\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4eff\u771f\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\uff0c\u73af\u5883\u611f\u77e5\u63d0\u793a\u76f8\u6bd4\u5185\u90e8\u9a71\u52a8\u57fa\u7ebf\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\"\u65e0\u8fdb\u98df\"\u4e8b\u4ef6\uff0c\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u95f4\u611f\u77e5\u63d0\u793a\u572820\u5929\u4eff\u771f\u4e2d\u5c06\u7d2f\u79ef\u65e0\u8fdb\u98df\u4e8b\u4ef6\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u51cf\u5c1160%\u4ee5\u4e0a\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u7edf\u8ba1\u663e\u8457\u6027(p < 0.05)\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u95ee\u9898\u5f62\u6210\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4f18\u5148\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u4f7fAI\u7cfb\u7edf\u80fd\u66f4\u81ea\u4e3b\u5730\u9002\u5e94\u73af\u5883\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u51b3\u7b56\u8d28\u91cf\uff0c\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u66f4\u667a\u80fd\u3001\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7684AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

Autoregressive models excel at sequential planning and constraint composition, yet struggle with tasks that require explicit spatial or physical grounding. Diffusion models, in contrast, capture rich spatial structure through high-dimensional generation, but lack the stepwise logical control needed to satisfy complex, multi-stage constraints or to reliably identify and correct errors. We introduce Collaborative Thoughts, a unified collaborative framework that enables autoregressive and diffusion models to reason and generate jointly through a closed-loop interaction. In Collaborative Thoughts, autoregressive models perform structured planning and constraint management, diffusion models instantiate these constraints as intermediate visual thoughts, and a vision-based critic module evaluates whether the visual thoughts satisfy the intended structural and physical requirements. This feedback is then used to iteratively refine subsequent planning and generation steps, mitigating error propagation across modalities. Importantly, Collaborative Thoughts uses the same collaborative loop regardless of whether the task is autoregressive question answering or diffusion-based visual generation. Through representative examples, we illustrate how Collaborative Thoughts can improve the reliability of spatial reasoning and the controllability of generation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faCollaborative Thoughts\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8ba9\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u8fc7\u95ed\u73af\u4ea4\u4e92\u534f\u540c\u5de5\u4f5c\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u4e24\u8005\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u6765\u63d0\u5347\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u751f\u6210\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\u64c5\u957f\u5e8f\u5217\u89c4\u5212\u548c\u7ea6\u675f\u7ec4\u5408\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7a7a\u95f4\u7269\u7406\u57fa\u7840\uff1b\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u6355\u6349\u4e30\u5bcc\u7a7a\u95f4\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9010\u6b65\u903b\u8f91\u63a7\u5236\u6765\u6ee1\u8db3\u590d\u6742\u591a\u9636\u6bb5\u7ea6\u675f\u6216\u53ef\u9760\u7ea0\u9519\u3002\u9700\u8981\u7ed3\u5408\u4e24\u8005\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "method": "Collaborative Thoughts\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\u8d1f\u8d23\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u89c4\u5212\u548c\u7ea6\u675f\u7ba1\u7406\uff0c\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5c06\u7ea6\u675f\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5316\u4e3a\u4e2d\u95f4\u89c6\u89c9\u601d\u7ef4\uff0c\u89c6\u89c9\u6279\u8bc4\u6a21\u5757\u8bc4\u4f30\u89c6\u89c9\u601d\u7ef4\u662f\u5426\u6ee1\u8db3\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u7269\u7406\u8981\u6c42\uff0c\u53cd\u9988\u7528\u4e8e\u8fed\u4ee3\u4f18\u5316\u540e\u7eed\u89c4\u5212\u548c\u751f\u6210\u6b65\u9aa4\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u793a\u4f8b\u5c55\u793a\u4e86Collaborative Thoughts\u5982\u4f55\u63d0\u9ad8\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u548c\u751f\u6210\u7684\u53ef\u63a7\u6027\uff0c\u51cf\u8f7b\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u9519\u8bef\u4f20\u64ad\u3002", "conclusion": "Collaborative Thoughts\u4e3a\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u548c\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u534f\u4f5c\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u65e0\u8bba\u4efb\u52a1\u662f\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u95ee\u7b54\u8fd8\u662f\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u90fd\u4f7f\u7528\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u534f\u4f5c\u5faa\u73af\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u751f\u6210\u8303\u5f0f\u7684\u4e92\u8865\u4f18\u52bf\u3002"}}

However, prevailing two-stage methods yield task-agnostic representations, decoupling them from downstream objectives. Recent prompt-based approaches attempt to fix this but introduce two challenges: they often lack explicit spatial priors, causing spatially incoherent inter-region modeling, and they lack robust mechanisms for explicit task-semantic alignment. We propose ToPT, a two-stage framework that delivers spatially consistent fusion and explicit task alignment. ToPT consists of two modules: spatial-aware region embedding learning (SREL) and task-aware prompting for region embeddings (Prompt4RE). SREL employs a Graphormer-based fusion module that injects spatial priors-distance and regional centrality-as learnable attention biases to capture coherent, interpretable inter-region interactions. Prompt4RE performs task-oriented prompting: a frozen multimodal large language model (MLLM) processes task-specific templates to obtain semantic vectors, which are aligned with region embeddings via multi-head cross-attention for stable task conditioning. Experiments across multiple tasks and cities show state-of-the-art performance, with improvements of up to 64.2\\%, validating the necessity and complementarity of spatial priors and prompt-region alignment.

Project page: http://flowsteer.org/", "summary": "In recent years, a variety of powerful agentic workflows have been applied to solve a wide range of human problems. However, existing workflow orchestration still faces key challenges, including high manual cost, reliance on specific operators/large language models (LLMs), and sparse reward signals. To address these challenges, we propose FlowSteer, an end-to-end reinforcement learning framework that takes a lightweight policy model as the agent and an executable canvas environment, automating workflow orchestration through multi-turn interaction. In this process, the policy model analyzes execution states and selects editing actions, while the canvas executes operators and returns feedback for iterative refinement.

This study evaluates deep learning-based nerve segmentation in ultrasound images of the brachial plexus using a U-Net architecture, with a focus on how dataset composition and annotation strategy influence segmentation performance. We find that training on combined data from multiple ultrasound machines (SIEMENS ACUSON NX3 Elite and Philips EPIQ5) provides regularization benefits for lower-performing acquisition sources, though it does not surpass single-source training when matched to the target domain. Extending the task from binary nerve segmentation to multi-class supervision (artery, vein, nerve, muscle) results in decreased nerve-specific Dice scores, with performance drops ranging from 9% to 61% depending on dataset, likely due to class imbalance and boundary ambiguity. Additionally, we observe a moderate positive correlation between nerve size and segmentation accuracy (Pearson r=0.587, p<0.001), indicating that smaller nerves remain a primary challenge.

TRIP-Bench leverages real-world data, offers 18 curated tools and 40+ travel requirements, and supports automated evaluation. It includes splits of varying difficulty; the hard split emphasizes long and ambiguous interactions, style shifts, feasibility changes, and iterative version revision. Dialogues span up to 15 user turns, can involve 150+ tool calls, and may exceed 200k tokens of context. Experiments show that even advanced models achieve at most 50\\% success on the easy split, with performance dropping below 10\\% on hard subsets. We further propose \\textbf{GTPO}, an online multi-turn reinforcement learning method with specialized reward normalization and reward differencing. Applied to Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct, GTPO improves constraint satisfaction and interaction robustness, outperforming Gemini-3-Pro in our evaluation.

However, most existing analyses rely on topic- or task-specific prompts, which can substantially limit what can be observed. In this work, we study what LLMs generate from minimal, topic-neutral inputs and probe their near-unconstrained generative behavior. Despite the absence of explicit topics, model outputs cover a broad semantic space, and surprisingly, each model family exhibits strong and systematic topical preferences. GPT-OSS predominantly generates programming (27.1%) and mathematical content (24.6%), whereas Llama most frequently generates literary content (9.1%). DeepSeek often generates religious content, while Qwen frequently generates multiple-choice questions. Beyond topical preferences, we also observe differences in content specialization and depth: GPT-OSS often generates more technically advanced content (e.g., dynamic programming) compared with other models (e.g., basic Python).

Automatic Prompt Optimization (APO) seeks to mitigate this instability, but existing approaches face two persistent challenges. First, commonly used prompt strategies rely on static instructions that perform well on average but fail to adapt to heterogeneous queries. Second, more dynamic approaches depend on offline reward models that are fundamentally correlational, confounding prompt effectiveness with query characteristics. We propose Causal Prompt Optimization (CPO), a framework that reframes prompt design as a problem of causal estimation. CPO operates in two stages. First, it learns an offline causal reward model by applying Double Machine Learning (DML) to semantic embeddings of prompts and queries, isolating the causal effect of prompt variations from confounding query attributes. Second, it utilizes this unbiased reward signal to guide a resource-efficient search for query-specific prompts without relying on costly online evaluation. We evaluate CPO across benchmarks in mathematical reasoning, visualization, and data analytics. CPO consistently outperforms human-engineered prompts and state-of-the-art automated optimizers. The gains are driven primarily by improved robustness on hard queries, where existing methods tend to deteriorate. Beyond performance, CPO fundamentally reshapes the economics of prompt optimization: by shifting evaluation from real-time model execution to an offline causal model, it enables high-precision, per-query customization at a fraction of the inference cost required by online methods. Together, these results establish causal inference as a scalable foundation for reliable and cost-efficient prompt optimization in enterprise LLM deployments.", "AI": {"tldr": "CPO\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u7406\u89e3\u51b3\u63d0\u793a\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u53cc\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u5206\u79bb\u63d0\u793a\u6548\u679c\u4e0e\u67e5\u8be2\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u79bb\u7ebf\u9ad8\u6548\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347LLM\u5728\u590d\u6742\u67e5\u8be2\u4e0a\u7684\u8868\u73b0", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u63d0\u793a\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e3b\u8981\u95ee\u9898\uff1a\u9759\u6001\u6307\u4ee4\u65e0\u6cd5\u9002\u5e94\u5f02\u6784\u67e5\u8be2\uff1b\u52a8\u6001\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u79bb\u7ebf\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u7c7b\u6a21\u578b\u672c\u8d28\u4e0a\u662f\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u7684\uff0c\u6df7\u6dc6\u4e86\u63d0\u793a\u6548\u679c\u4e0e\u67e5\u8be2\u7279\u5f81\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u9694\u79bb\u63d0\u793a\u56e0\u679c\u6548\u5e94\u3001\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u67e5\u8be2\u7279\u5b9a\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u56e0\u679c\u63d0\u793a\u4f18\u5316(CPO)\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5206\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\uff1a1) \u4f7f\u7528\u53cc\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60(DML)\u5728\u63d0\u793a\u548c\u67e5\u8be2\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u5d4c\u5165\u4e0a\u5b66\u4e60\u79bb\u7ebf\u56e0\u679c\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u9694\u79bb\u63d0\u793a\u53d8\u4f53\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u6548\u5e94\u4e0e\u6df7\u6dc6\u7684\u67e5\u8be2\u5c5e\u6027\uff1b2) \u5229\u7528\u65e0\u504f\u5956\u52b1\u4fe1\u53f7\u6307\u5bfc\u8d44\u6e90\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u67e5\u8be2\u7279\u5b9a\u63d0\u793a\u641c\u7d22\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4f9d\u8d56\u6602\u8d35\u7684\u5728\u7ebf\u8bc4\u4f30", "result": "\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u548c\u6570\u636e\u5206\u6790\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cCPO\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8e\u4eba\u5de5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u548c\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u3002\u6539\u8fdb\u4e3b\u8981\u7531\u5728\u56f0\u96be\u67e5\u8be2\u4e0a\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u63d0\u5347\u9a71\u52a8\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8fd9\u4e9b\u67e5\u8be2\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f1a\u6076\u5316", "conclusion": "CPO\u4ece\u6839\u672c\u4e0a\u91cd\u5851\u4e86\u63d0\u793a\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5b66\uff1a\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u8bc4\u4f30\u4ece\u5b9e\u65f6\u6a21\u578b\u6267\u884c\u8f6c\u79fb\u5230\u79bb\u7ebf\u56e0\u679c\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u80fd\u4ee5\u5728\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u6240\u9700\u63a8\u7406\u6210\u672c\u7684\u4e00\u5c0f\u90e8\u5206\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3001\u6bcf\u67e5\u8be2\u5b9a\u5236\u5316\u3002\u56e0\u679c\u63a8\u65ad\u4e3a\u53ef\u9760\u4e14\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u4f18\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u57fa\u7840"}}

Existing decoding methods, such as contrastive decoding (CD), rely on random perturbations to construct contrastive data for mitigating hallucination patterns. However, such a way is hard to control the visual cues that drive hallucination or well align with model weaknesses. We propose Model-aware Counterfactual Data based Contrastive Decoding (MACD), a new inference strategy that combines model-guided counterfactual construction with decoding. Our approach uses the Video-LLM's own feedback to identify object regions most responsible for hallucination, generating targeted counterfactual inputs at the object level rather than arbitrary frame or temporal modifications. These model-aware counterfactual data is then integrated into CD to enforce evidence-grounded token selection during decoding.

Existing mitigations rely on static defenses that cannot adapt to novel exploitation strategies. We propose Adversarial Reward Auditing (ARA), a framework that reconceptualizes reward hacking as a dynamic, competitive game. ARA operates in two stages: first, a Hacker policy discovers reward model vulnerabilities while an Auditor learns to detect exploitation from latent representations; second, Auditor-Guided RLHF (AG-RLHF) gates reward signals to penalize detected hacking, transforming reward hacking from an unobservable failure into a measurable, controllable signal. Experiments across three hacking scenarios demonstrate that ARA achieves the best alignment-utility tradeoff among all baselines: reducing sycophancy to near-SFT levels while improving helpfulness, decreasing verbosity while achieving the highest ROUGE-L, and suppressing code gaming while improving Pass@1. Beyond single-domain evaluation, we show that reward hacking, detection, and mitigation all generalize across domains -- a Hacker trained on code gaming exhibits increased sycophancy despite no reward for this behavior, and an Auditor trained on one domain effectively suppresses exploitation in others, enabling efficient multi-domain defense with a single model.", "AI": {"tldr": "ARA\u6846\u67b6\u5c06\u5956\u52b1\u9ed1\u5ba2\u653b\u51fb\u91cd\u6784\u4e3a\u52a8\u6001\u7ade\u4e89\u6e38\u620f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u9ed1\u5ba2\u53d1\u73b0\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u6f0f\u6d1e\u3001\u5ba1\u8ba1\u5458\u68c0\u6d4b\u5229\u7528\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u518d\u901a\u8fc7\u5ba1\u8ba1\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684RLHF\u60e9\u7f5a\u9ed1\u5ba2\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\u5bf9\u9f50-\u6548\u7528\u5e73\u8861\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709RLHF\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bb9\u6613\u53d7\u5230\u5956\u52b1\u9ed1\u5ba2\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u5229\u7528\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u865a\u5047\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u83b7\u5f97\u9ad8\u5206\u4f46\u8fdd\u53cd\u4eba\u7c7b\u610f\u56fe\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u6709\u7f13\u89e3\u63aa\u65bd\u4f9d\u8d56\u9759\u6001\u9632\u5fa1\u65e0\u6cd5\u9002\u5e94\u65b0\u7684\u5229\u7528\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u5956\u52b1\u5ba1\u8ba1\uff08ARA\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u7b2c\u4e00\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u9ed1\u5ba2\u7b56\u7565\u53d1\u73b0\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u6f0f\u6d1e\uff0c\u5ba1\u8ba1\u5458\u4ece\u6f5c\u5728\u8868\u793a\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u68c0\u6d4b\u5229\u7528\u884c\u4e3a\uff1b\u7b2c\u4e8c\u9636\u6bb5\uff0c\u5ba1\u8ba1\u5f15\u5bfc\u7684RLHF\uff08AG-RLHF\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u95e8\u63a7\u5956\u52b1\u4fe1\u53f7\u60e9\u7f5a\u68c0\u6d4b\u5230\u7684\u9ed1\u5ba2\u653b\u51fb\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e09\u79cd\u9ed1\u5ba2\u653b\u51fb\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\uff0cARA\u5728\u6240\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u4f73\u5bf9\u9f50-\u6548\u7528\u5e73\u8861\uff1a\u5c06\u5949\u627f\u884c\u4e3a\u964d\u81f3\u63a5\u8fd1SFT\u6c34\u5e73\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u9ad8\u5e2e\u52a9\u6027\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u5197\u957f\u540c\u65f6\u83b7\u5f97\u6700\u9ad8ROUGE-L\uff0c\u6291\u5236\u4ee3\u7801\u6e38\u620f\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u9ad8Pass@1\u3002\u5956\u52b1\u9ed1\u5ba2\u653b\u51fb\u3001\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u7f13\u89e3\u90fd\u5177\u6709\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "ARA\u5c06\u5956\u52b1\u9ed1\u5ba2\u653b\u51fb\u4ece\u4e0d\u53ef\u89c2\u5bdf\u7684\u5931\u8d25\u8f6c\u53d8\u4e3a\u53ef\u6d4b\u91cf\u3001\u53ef\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u7ade\u4e89\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3RLHF\u4e2d\u7684\u5956\u52b1\u9ed1\u5ba2\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u591a\u9886\u57df\u9632\u5fa1\u3002"}}

To bridge this compute divide, we introduce Distill3R, a framework designed to distill the geometric reasoning of 3D foundation models into compact students fully trainable on a single workstation. Our methodology centers on two primary innovations: (1) an offline caching pipeline that decouples heavy teacher inference from the training loop through compressed supervision signals, and (2) a confidence-aware distillation loss that leverages teacher uncertainty to enable training on commodity hardware. We propose a 72M-parameter student model which achieves a 9x reduction in parameters and a 5x inference speedup compared to its 650M-parameter teacher. The student is fully trainable in under 3 days on a single workstation, whereas its teacher requires massive GPU clusters for up to a week. We demonstrate that the student preserves the structural consistency and qualitative geometric understanding required for functional 3D awareness. By providing a reproducible, single-workstation training recipe, Distill3R serves as an exploratory entry point for democratized 3D vision research and efficient edge deployment.

Existing TCM benchmarks are fragmented in coverage and scale and rely on non-unified or generation-heavy scoring that hinders fair comparison. We present the LingLanMiDian (LingLan) benchmark, a large-scale, expert-curated, multi-task suite that unifies evaluation across knowledge recall, multi-hop reasoning, information extraction, and real-world clinical decision-making. LingLan introduces a consistent metric design, a synonym-tolerant protocol for clinical labels, a per-dataset 400-item Hard subset, and a reframing of diagnosis and treatment recommendation into single-choice decision recognition. We conduct comprehensive, zero-shot evaluations on 14 leading open-source and proprietary LLMs, providing a unified perspective on their strengths and limitations in TCM commonsense knowledge understanding, reasoning, and clinical decision support; critically, the evaluation on Hard subset reveals a substantial gap between current models and human experts in TCM-specialized reasoning. By bridging fundamental knowledge and applied reasoning through standardized evaluation, LingLan establishes a unified, quantitative, and extensible foundation for advancing TCM LLMs and domain-specific medical AI research.

Existing token reduction methods typically exploit \\textit{either} vision-encoder saliency (broad but query-agnostic) \\textit{or} LLM cross-attention (query-aware but sparse and costly). We show that neither signal alone is sufficient: fusing them consistently improves performance compared to unimodal visual token selection (ranking). However, making such fusion practical is non-trivial: cross-modal saliency is usually only available \\emph{inside} the LLM (too late for efficient pre-LLM pruning), and the two signals are inherently asymmetric, so naive fusion underutilizes their complementary strengths. We propose \\textbf{ConsensusDrop}, a training-free framework that derives a \\emph{consensus} ranking by reconciling vision encoder saliency with query-aware cross-attention, retaining the most informative tokens while compressing the remainder via encoder-guided token merging. Across LLaVA-1.5/NeXT, Video-LLaVA, and other open-source VLMs, ConsensusDrop consistently outperforms prior pruning methods under identical token budgets and delivers a stronger accuracy-efficiency Pareto frontier -- preserving near-baseline accuracy even at aggressive token reductions while reducing TTFT and KV cache footprint.

To differentiate agent behavior in the multi-agent system, current frameworks typically assign generic role-based personas such as ''reviewer'' or ''writer'' or rely on coarse grained keyword-based personas. While functional, this approach oversimplifies how human scientists operate, whose contributions are shaped by their unique research trajectories. In response, we propose INDIBATOR, a framework for molecular discovery that grounds agents in individualized scientist profiles constructed from two modalities: publication history for literature-derived knowledge and molecular history for structural priors.

We argue that genuine affective intelligence requires explicit modeling of Theory of Mind (ToM), the cognitive substrate from which emotions arise. To this end, we introduce HitEmotion, a ToM-grounded hierarchical benchmark that diagnoses capability breakpoints across increasing levels of cognitive depth. Second, we propose a ToM-guided reasoning chain that tracks mental states and calibrates cross-modal evidence to achieve faithful emotional reasoning. We further introduce TMPO, a reinforcement learning method that uses intermediate mental states as process-level supervision to guide and strengthen model reasoning. Extensive experiments show that HitEmotion exposes deep emotional reasoning deficits in state-of-the-art models, especially on cognitively demanding tasks. In evaluation, the ToM-guided reasoning chain and TMPO improve end-task accuracy and yield more faithful, more coherent rationales.

Technical Report for winning solutions (Track 1 & Track 2) at the NeurIPS 2025 Mouse vs. AI Challenge", "summary": "Visual robustness and neural alignment remain critical challenges in developing artificial agents that can match biological vision systems. We present the winning approaches from Team HCMUS_TheFangs for both tracks of the NeurIPS 2025 Mouse vs. AI: Robust Visual Foraging Competition. For Track 1 (Visual Robustness), we demonstrate that architectural simplicity combined with targeted components yields superior generalization, achieving 95.4% final score with a lightweight two-layer CNN enhanced by Gated Linear Units and observation normalization. For Track 2 (Neural Alignment), we develop a deep ResNet-like architecture with 16 convolutional layers and GLU-based gating that achieves top-1 neural prediction performance with 17.8 million parameters. Our systematic analysis of ten model checkpoints trained between 60K to 1.14M steps reveals that training duration exhibits a non-monotonic relationship with performance, with optimal results achieved around 200K steps. Through comprehensive ablation studies and failure case analysis, we provide insights into why simpler architectures excel at visual robustness while deeper models with increased capacity achieve better neural alignment. Our results challenge conventional assumptions about model complexity in visuomotor learning and offer practical guidance for developing robust, biologically-inspired visual agents.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86NeurIPS 2025 Mouse vs. AI\u7ade\u8d5b\u4e2d\u83b7\u80dc\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1aTrack 1\u4f7f\u7528\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u4e24\u5c42CNN+GLU\u5b9e\u73b0\u89c6\u89c9\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0895.4%\u5206\u6570\uff09\uff1bTrack 2\u4f7f\u752816\u5c42ResNet-like\u67b6\u6784\u5b9e\u73b0\u795e\u7ecf\u5bf9\u9f50\u6700\u4f73\u6027\u80fd\uff081780\u4e07\u53c2\u6570\uff09\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u6b65\u6570\u4e0e\u6027\u80fd\u5448\u975e\u5355\u8c03\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u6700\u4f73\u7ed3\u679c\u572820\u4e07\u6b65\u5de6\u53f3\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u89c6\u89c9\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u795e\u7ecf\u5bf9\u9f50\u8fd9\u4e24\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u80fd\u591f\u5339\u914d\u751f\u7269\u89c6\u89c9\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u4eba\u5de5\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u53c2\u52a0NeurIPS 2025\u7ade\u8d5b\uff0c\u63a2\u7d22\u4e0d\u540c\u67b6\u6784\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u5dee\u5f02\u3002", "method": "Track 1\u91c7\u7528\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u4e24\u5c42CNN\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u95e8\u63a7\u7ebf\u6027\u5355\u5143\u548c\u89c2\u6d4b\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\uff1bTrack 2\u91c7\u752816\u5c42\u5377\u79ef\u7684ResNet-like\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u540c\u6837\u4f7f\u7528GLU\u95e8\u63a7\u673a\u5236\u3002\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\u4e8610\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u68c0\u67e5\u70b9\uff086\u4e07\u5230114\u4e07\u8bad\u7ec3\u6b65\u6570\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u8fdb\u884c\u5168\u9762\u7684\u6d88\u878d\u7814\u7a76\u548c\u5931\u8d25\u6848\u4f8b\u5206\u6790\u3002", "result": "Track 1\u83b7\u5f9795.4%\u6700\u7ec8\u5206\u6570\uff0cTrack 2\u83b7\u5f97top-1\u795e\u7ecf\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\uff081780\u4e07\u53c2\u6570\uff09\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u8bad\u7ec3\u6b65\u6570\u4e0e\u6027\u80fd\u5448\u975e\u5355\u8c03\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u6700\u4f73\u7ed3\u679c\u572820\u4e07\u6b65\u5de6\u53f3\u3002\u7b80\u5355\u67b6\u6784\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u800c\u66f4\u6df1\u5c42\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u795e\u7ecf\u5bf9\u9f50\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u6311\u6218\u4e86\u5173\u4e8e\u89c6\u89c9\u8fd0\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u6a21\u578b\u590d\u6742\u6027\u7684\u4f20\u7edf\u5047\u8bbe\uff0c\u4e3a\u5f00\u53d1\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u3001\u53d7\u751f\u7269\u5b66\u542f\u53d1\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u6307\u5bfc\u3002\u7b80\u5355\u67b6\u6784\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u800c\u66f4\u5927\u5bb9\u91cf\u7684\u6df1\u5c42\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u795e\u7ecf\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u66f4\u597d\u3002"}}

Sudden motion during 3D acquisition can lead to unsampled retinal regions across entire B-scans (cross-sectional slices), resulting in blank bands in en face projections. We propose VAMOS-OCTA, a deep learning framework for inpainting motion-corrupted B-scans using vessel-aware multi-axis supervision. We employ a 2.5D U-Net architecture that takes a stack of neighboring B-scans as input to reconstruct a corrupted center B-scan, guided by a novel Vessel-Aware Multi-Axis Orthogonal Supervision (VAMOS) loss. This loss combines vessel-weighted intensity reconstruction with axial and lateral projection consistency, encouraging vascular continuity in native B-scans and across orthogonal planes. Unlike prior work that focuses primarily on restoring the en face MIP, VAMOS-OCTA jointly enhances both cross-sectional B-scan sharpness and volumetric projection accuracy, even under severe motion corruptions. We trained our model on both synthetic and real-world corrupted volumes and evaluated its performance using both perceptual quality and pixel-wise accuracy metrics. VAMOS-OCTA consistently outperforms prior methods, producing reconstructions with sharp capillaries, restored vessel continuity, and clean en face projections. These results demonstrate that multi-axis supervision offers a powerful constraint for restoring motion-degraded 3D OCTA data.

This insufficient experience reuse leads to computational redundancy and execution instability. To bridge this gap, we propose ProcMEM, a framework that enables agents to autonomously learn procedural memory from interaction experiences without parameter updates. By formalizing a Skill-MDP, ProcMEM transforms passive episodic narratives into executable Skills defined by activation, execution, and termination conditions to ensure executability. To achieve reliable reusability without capability degradation, we introduce Non-Parametric PPO, which leverages semantic gradients for high-quality candidate generation and a PPO Gate for robust Skill verification. Through score-based maintenance, ProcMEM sustains compact, high-quality procedural memory. Experimental results across in-domain, cross-task, and cross-agent scenarios demonstrate that ProcMEM achieves superior reuse rates and significant performance gains with extreme memory compression.

However, existing MLLM-based approaches remain largely focused on surface-level descriptions of anomalies, lacking deep reasoning over abnormal behaviors like explicit self-reflection and self-correction. To address that, we propose Self-Reflection-Enhanced Reasoning for Video Anomaly Understanding (SRVAU-R1), a reflection-aware learning framework that incorporates reflection in MLLM reasoning. Specifically, SRVAU-R1 introduces the first reflection-oriented Chain-of-Thought dataset tailored for VAU, providing structured supervision with initial reasoning, self-reflection, and revised reasoning. Based on that, it includes a novel reflection-aware learning paradigm with supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement fine-tuning to enhance multi-modal reasoning for VAU.

Without altering the mechanism, we view standard attention through a top-N selection lens and study its behaviour directly in value-state space. We define geometric metrics - Precision, Recall, and F-score - to quantify separability between selected and non-selected tokens, and derive non-asymptotic bounds with explicit dependence on dimension and margin under empirically motivated assumptions (stable value norms with a compressed sink token, exponential similarity decay, and piecewise attention weight profiles). The theory predicts a small-N operating regime of strongest non-trivial separability and clarifies how sequence length and sink similarity shape the metrics. Empirically, across LLaMA-2-7B, Gemma-7B, and Mistral-7B, measurements closely track the theoretical envelopes: top-N selection sharpens separability, sink similarity correlates with Recall. We also found that in LLaMA-2-7B heads specialize into three regimes - Retriever, Mixer, Reset - with distinct geometric signatures.

To address this issue, we propose LocalScore, a simple yet effective scoring algorithm that explicitly incorporates the local density of the gallery feature distribution using the k-th nearest neighbors. LocalScore is architecture-agnostic, loss-independent, and incurs negligible computational overhead, making it a plug-and-play solution for existing biometric systems. Extensive experiments across multiple modalities demonstrate that LocalScore consistently achieves substantial gains in open-set retrieval (FNIR@FPIR reduced from 53% to 40%) and verification (TAR@FAR improved from 51% to 74%).

Salim", "Claudio Bettini"], "title": "DomusFM: A Foundation Model for Smart-Home Sensor Data", "comment": null, "summary": "Smart-home sensor data holds significant potential for several applications, including healthcare monitoring and assistive technologies. Existing approaches, however, face critical limitations. Supervised models require impractical amounts of labeled data. Foundation models for activity recognition focus only on inertial sensors, failing to address the unique characteristics of smart-home binary sensor events: their sparse, discrete nature combined with rich semantic associations. LLM-based approaches, while tested in this domain, still raise several issues regarding the need for natural language descriptions or prompting, and reliance on either external services or expensive hardware, making them infeasible in real-life scenarios due to privacy and cost concerns. We introduce DomusFM, the first foundation model specifically designed and pretrained for smart-home sensor data. DomusFM employs a self-supervised dual contrastive learning paradigm to capture both token-level semantic attributes and sequence-level temporal dependencies. By integrating semantic embeddings from a lightweight language model and specialized encoders for temporal patterns and binary states, DomusFM learns generalizable representations that transfer across environments and tasks related to activity and event analysis. Through leave-one-dataset-out evaluation across seven public smart-home datasets, we demonstrate that DomusFM outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on different downstream tasks, achieving superior performance even with only 5% of labeled training data available for fine-tuning. Our approach addresses data scarcity while maintaining practical deployability for real-world smart-home systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "DomusFM\u662f\u9996\u4e2a\u4e13\u95e8\u4e3a\u667a\u80fd\u5bb6\u5c45\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u6570\u636e\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u53cc\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u5728\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u5b9e\u73b0\u8de8\u73af\u5883\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u667a\u80fd\u5bb6\u5c45\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u6570\u636e\u5728\u533b\u7597\u76d1\u6d4b\u548c\u8f85\u52a9\u6280\u672f\u4e2d\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u5173\u952e\u9650\u5236\uff1a\u76d1\u7763\u6a21\u578b\u9700\u8981\u5927\u91cf\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\uff1b\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u4ec5\u5173\u6ce8\u60ef\u6027\u4f20\u611f\u5668\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5904\u7406\u667a\u80fd\u5bb6\u5c45\u4e8c\u8fdb\u5236\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u4e8b\u4ef6\u7684\u7a00\u758f\u79bb\u6563\u7279\u6027\u548c\u4e30\u5bcc\u8bed\u4e49\u5173\u8054\uff1b\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u9690\u79c1\u548c\u6210\u672c\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "DomusFM\u91c7\u7528\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u53cc\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u6574\u5408\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u5d4c\u5165\u3001\u65f6\u95f4\u6a21\u5f0f\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u548c\u4e8c\u8fdb\u5236\u72b6\u6001\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u6355\u6349\u4ee4\u724c\u7ea7\u8bed\u4e49\u5c5e\u6027\u548c\u5e8f\u5217\u7ea7\u65f6\u95f4\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e03\u4e2a\u516c\u5171\u667a\u80fd\u5bb6\u5c45\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u7559\u4e00\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\uff0cDomusFM\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u4ec5\u67095%\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u7528\u4e8e\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u4e5f\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u5353\u8d8a\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "DomusFM\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u667a\u80fd\u5bb6\u5c45\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u53ef\u884c\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u73b0\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u667a\u80fd\u5bb6\u5c45\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Several studies showed that deep learning algorithms designed to classify benign and malignant thyroid nodules could match radiologists' performance. However, data availability for training deep learning models is often limited due to the significant effort required to curate such datasets. The previous study proposed a method to curate thyroid nodule datasets automatically. It was tested to have a 63% yield rate and 83% accuracy. However, the usefulness of the generated data for training deep learning models remains unknown. In this study, we conducted experiments to determine whether using a automatically-curated dataset improves deep learning algorithms' performance. We trained deep learning models on the manually annotated and automatically-curated datasets. We also trained with a smaller subset of the automatically-curated dataset that has higher accuracy to explore the optimum usage of such dataset. As a result, the deep learning model trained on the manually selected dataset has an AUC of 0.643 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.62, 0.66). It is significantly lower than the AUC of the 6automatically-curated dataset trained deep learning model, 0.694 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.67, 0.73, P < .001). The AUC of the accurate subset trained deep learning model is 0.689 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.66, 0.72, P > .43), which is insignificantly worse than the AUC of the full automatically-curated dataset. In conclusion, we showed that using a automatically-curated dataset can substantially increase the performance of deep learning algorithms, and it is suggested to use all the data rather than only using the accurate subset.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u81ea\u52a8\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u7532\u72b6\u817a\u7ed3\u8282\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e14\u4f7f\u7528\u5168\u90e8\u81ea\u52a8\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u6bd4\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5b50\u96c6\u6548\u679c\u66f4\u597d\u3002", "motivation": "\u7532\u72b6\u817a\u7ed3\u8282\u764c\u75c7\u8bca\u65ad\u901a\u5e38\u4f7f\u7528\u8d85\u58f0\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\u80fd\u5339\u914d\u653e\u5c04\u79d1\u533b\u751f\u6c34\u5e73\uff0c\u4f46\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\u83b7\u53d6\u56f0\u96be\u3002\u5148\u524d\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u81ea\u52a8\u6807\u6ce8\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0863%\u4ea7\u51fa\u7387\uff0c83%\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u5bf9\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u6548\u679c\u672a\u77e5\u3002", "method": "\u5728\u624b\u52a8\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u81ea\u52a8\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5206\u522b\u8bad\u7ec3\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4f7f\u7528\u81ea\u52a8\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e2d\u7cbe\u5ea6\u8f83\u9ad8\u7684\u5b50\u96c6\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u4ee5\u63a2\u7d22\u6700\u4f73\u4f7f\u7528\u65b9\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "\u624b\u52a8\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6a21\u578bAUC\u4e3a0.643\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u4f4e\u4e8e\u81ea\u52a8\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6a21\u578bAUC 0.694\uff08P<0.001\uff09\u3002\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5b50\u96c6\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6a21\u578bAUC\u4e3a0.689\uff0c\u4e0e\u5b8c\u6574\u81ea\u52a8\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u65e0\u663e\u8457\u5dee\u5f02\uff08P>0.43\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "\u81ea\u52a8\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7b97\u6cd5\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5efa\u8bae\u4f7f\u7528\u5168\u90e8\u81ea\u52a8\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u800c\u975e\u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u9ad8\u7cbe\u5ea6\u5b50\u96c6\u3002"}}

Large Language Models (LLM) are currently a major trend in text processing, but few works study their usefulness for this task. Formal Concept Analysis (FCA) has recently been presented as a candidate for topic modeling, but no real applied case study has been conducted. In this work, we compare LLM and FCA to better understand their strengths and weakneses in the topic modeling field. FCA is evaluated through the CREA pipeline used in past experiments on topic modeling and visualization, whereas GPT-5 is used for the LLM.

EEG-based signals can reveal a persons emotional state, as they directly reflect activity in different brain regions. Emotion-aware systems and EEG-based emotion recognition are a growing research area. This paper presents how machine learning (ML) models categorize a limited dataset of EEG signals into three different classes, namely Negative, Neutral, or Positive. It also presents the complete workflow, including data preprocessing and comparison of ML models. To understand which ML classification model works best for this kind of problem, we train and test the following three commonly used models: logistic regression (LR), support vector machine (SVM), and random forest (RF). The performance of each is evaluated with respect to accuracy and F1-score. The results indicate that ML models can be effectively utilized for three-way emotion classification of EEG signals. Among the three ML models trained on the available dataset, the RF model gave the best results. Its higher accuracy and F1-score suggest that it is able to capture the emotional patterns more accurately and effectively than the other two models. The RF model also outperformed the existing state-of-the-art classification models in terms of the accuracy parameter.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4f7f\u7528\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9EEG\u4fe1\u53f7\u8fdb\u884c\u4e09\u5206\u7c7b\u60c5\u611f\u8bc6\u522b\uff08\u6d88\u6781\u3001\u4e2d\u6027\u3001\u79ef\u6781\uff09\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u903b\u8f91\u56de\u5f52\u3001\u652f\u6301\u5411\u91cf\u673a\u548c\u968f\u673a\u68ee\u6797\u4e09\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u968f\u673a\u68ee\u6797\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u548cF1\u5206\u6570\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\u3002", "motivation": "EEG\u4fe1\u53f7\u80fd\u591f\u76f4\u63a5\u53cd\u6620\u5927\u8111\u6d3b\u52a8\uff0c\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc6\u522b\u4eba\u7684\u60c5\u7eea\u72b6\u6001\u3002\u968f\u7740\u60c5\u611f\u611f\u77e5\u7cfb\u7edf\u548cEEG\u60c5\u611f\u8bc6\u522b\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u63a2\u7d22\u54ea\u79cd\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u6700\u9002\u5408\u5904\u7406\u6709\u9650EEG\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u4e09\u5206\u7c7b\u60c5\u611f\u8bc6\u522b\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u91c7\u7528\u5b8c\u6574\u7684\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u6570\u636e\u9884\u5904\u7406\u548c\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002\u5728\u6709\u9650\u7684EEG\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e86\u4e09\u79cd\u5e38\u7528\u6a21\u578b\uff1a\u903b\u8f91\u56de\u5f52(LR)\u3001\u652f\u6301\u5411\u91cf\u673a(SVM)\u548c\u968f\u673a\u68ee\u6797(RF)\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u548cF1\u5206\u6570\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u7528\u4e8eEEG\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u4e09\u5206\u7c7b\u60c5\u611f\u8bc6\u522b\u3002\u5728\u4e09\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\uff0c\u968f\u673a\u68ee\u6797\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff0c\u5176\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u548cF1\u5206\u6570\u8868\u660e\u5b83\u6bd4\u5176\u4ed6\u4e24\u79cd\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u80fd\u51c6\u786e\u6709\u6548\u5730\u6355\u6349\u60c5\u611f\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002\u968f\u673a\u68ee\u6797\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u53c2\u6570\u4e0a\u4e5f\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u5206\u7c7b\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u968f\u673a\u68ee\u6797\u662f\u5904\u7406\u6709\u9650EEG\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e09\u5206\u7c7b\u60c5\u611f\u8bc6\u522b\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u6700\u6709\u6548\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u548cF1\u5206\u6570\u4e0a\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u903b\u8f91\u56de\u5f52\u548c\u652f\u6301\u5411\u91cf\u673a\uff0c\u4e14\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Despite advances in multi-camera systems and high-resolution depth sensors, fusing large-scale multi-view depth observations into high-quality point clouds under strict real-time constraints remains challenging. Existing methods relying on voxel-based fusion, temporal accumulation, or global optimization suffer from high computational complexity, excessive memory usage, and limited scalability, failing to simultaneously achieve real-time performance, reconstruction quality, and multi-camera extensibility. We propose FUSE-Flow, a frame-wise, stateless, and linearly scalable point cloud streaming reconstruction framework. Each frame independently generates point cloud fragments, fused via two weights, measurement confidence and 3D distance consistency to suppress noise while preserving geometric details. For large-scale multi-camera efficiency, we introduce an adaptive spatial hashing-based weighted aggregation method: 3D space is adaptively partitioned by local point cloud density, representative points are selected per cell, and weighted fusion is performed to handle both sparse and dense regions. With GPU parallelization, FUSE-Flow achieves high-throughput, low-latency point cloud generation and fusion with linear complexity. Experiments demonstrate that the framework improves reconstruction stability and geometric fidelity in overlapping, depth-discontinuous, and dynamic scenes, while maintaining real-time frame rates on modern GPUs, verifying its effectiveness, robustness, and scalability.", "AI": {"tldr": "FUSE-Flow\uff1a\u4e00\u79cd\u5b9e\u65f6\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u70b9\u4e91\u91cd\u5efa\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5e27\u95f4\u72ec\u7acb\u5904\u7406\u3001\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7a7a\u95f4\u54c8\u5e0c\u548c\u52a0\u6743\u878d\u5408\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u51e0\u4f55\u7ec6\u8282\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u7ebf\u6027\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027", "motivation": "\u5b9e\u65f6\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u70b9\u4e91\u91cd\u5efa\u5728VR/AR\u3001\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u5bfc\u822a\u3001\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\u7b49\u9886\u57df\u6709\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u4f46\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u3001\u5185\u5b58\u4f7f\u7528\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u5b9e\u65f6\u6027\u80fd\u3001\u91cd\u5efa\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u591a\u76f8\u673a\u6269\u5c55\u6027", "method": "\u63d0\u51faFUSE-Flow\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u6bcf\u5e27\u72ec\u7acb\u751f\u6210\u70b9\u4e91\u7247\u6bb5\uff1b2\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u6d4b\u91cf\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u548c3D\u8ddd\u79bb\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u4e24\u4e2a\u6743\u91cd\u8fdb\u884c\u878d\u5408\u4ee5\u6291\u5236\u566a\u58f0\uff1b3\uff09\u5f15\u5165\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7a7a\u95f4\u54c8\u5e0c\u52a0\u6743\u805a\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6839\u636e\u5c40\u90e8\u70b9\u4e91\u5bc6\u5ea6\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5212\u52063D\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5355\u5143\u9009\u62e9\u4ee3\u8868\u70b9\u8fdb\u884c\u52a0\u6743\u878d\u5408\uff1b4\uff09GPU\u5e76\u884c\u5316\u5b9e\u73b0", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u91cd\u53e0\u533a\u57df\u3001\u6df1\u5ea6\u4e0d\u8fde\u7eed\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u91cd\u5efa\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u51e0\u4f55\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5728\u73b0\u4ee3GPU\u4e0a\u4fdd\u6301\u5b9e\u65f6\u5e27\u7387\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027", "conclusion": "FUSE-Flow\u901a\u8fc7\u5e27\u95f4\u72ec\u7acb\u5904\u7406\u3001\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7a7a\u95f4\u54c8\u5e0c\u548c\u52a0\u6743\u878d\u5408\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7ebf\u6027\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u591a\u89c6\u89d2\u70b9\u4e91\u91cd\u5efa\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u3001\u5185\u5b58\u4f7f\u7528\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u9650\u5236"}}

Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) is an effective training-free technique to address the massive memory and computation overhead. Existing quantization paradigms fall short as they are oblivious to two critical forms of heterogeneity: the inherent discrepancy between vision and language tokens, and the non-uniform contribution of different experts. To bridge this gap, we propose Visual Expert Quantization (VEQ), a dual-aware quantization framework designed to simultaneously accommodate cross-modal differences and heterogeneity between experts. Specifically, VEQ incorporates 1)Modality-expert-aware Quantization, which utilizes expert activation frequency to prioritize error minimization for pivotal experts, and 2)Modality-affinity-aware Quantization, which constructs an enhanced Hessian matrix by integrating token-expert affinity with modality information to guide the calibration process. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks verify that VEQ consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. Specifically, under the W3A16 configuration, our method achieves significant average accuracy gains of 2.04\\% on Kimi-VL and 3.09\\% on Qwen3-VL compared to the previous SOTA quantization methods, demonstrating superior robustness across various multimodal tasks.

Existing approaches often rely on the parametric knowledge of a model or assume that patients provide rich and concrete information, which is unrealistic. To address these limitations, we propose a conversational diagnosis system that explores a diagnostic knowledge graph to reason in two steps: (i) generating diagnostic hypotheses from the dialogue context, and (ii) verifying hypotheses through clarifying questions, which are repeated until a final diagnosis is reached. Since evaluating the system requires a realistic patient simulator that responds to the system's questions, we adopt a well-established simulator along with patient profiles from MIMIC-IV.

In this work, we focus on a foundational redesign task termed design layout editing, which seeks to autonomously modify the geometric composition of a design based on user intents. To overcome the ambiguity of user needs expressed in natural language, we introduce four basic and important editing actions and standardize the format of editing operations. The underexplored task presents a unique challenge: satisfying specified editing operations while simultaneously preserving the layout structure of unedited elements. Besides, the scarcity of triplet (original design, editing operation, edited design) samples poses another formidable challenge. To this end, we present ReLayout, a novel framework for versatile and structure-preserving design layout editing that operates without triplet data. Specifically, ReLayout first introduces the relation graph, which contains the position and size relationships among unedited elements, as the constraint for layout structure preservation. Then, relation-aware design reconstruction (RADR) is proposed to bypass the data challenge. By learning to reconstruct a design from its elements, a relation graph, and a synthesized editing operation, RADR effectively emulates the editing process in a self-supervised manner. A multi-modal large language model serves as the backbone for RADR, unifying multiple editing actions within a single model and thus achieving versatile editing after fine-tuning. Qualitative, quantitative results and user studies show that ReLayout significantly outperforms the baseline models in terms of editing quality, accuracy, and layout structure preservation.", "AI": {"tldr": "ReLayout\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u65e0\u9700\u4e09\u5143\u7ec4\u6570\u636e\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5e03\u5c40\u7f16\u8f91\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5173\u7cfb\u56fe\u4fdd\u6301\u672a\u7f16\u8f91\u5143\u7d20\u7684\u5e03\u5c40\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5173\u7cfb\u611f\u77e5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u91cd\u5efa\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u79cd\u7f16\u8f91\u64cd\u4f5c\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u4e2d\u9700\u8981\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u91cd\u8bbe\u8ba1\u800c\u65e0\u9700\u4eba\u5de5\u8c03\u6574\u3002\u7528\u6237\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u8868\u8fbe\u7684\u7f16\u8f91\u610f\u56fe\u5b58\u5728\u6b67\u4e49\uff0c\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\uff08\u539f\u59cb\u8bbe\u8ba1\u3001\u7f16\u8f91\u64cd\u4f5c\u3001\u7f16\u8f91\u540e\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff09\u4e09\u5143\u7ec4\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u9700\u8981\u4fdd\u6301\u672a\u7f16\u8f91\u5143\u7d20\u7684\u5e03\u5c40\u7ed3\u6784\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faReLayout\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u5f15\u5165\u5173\u7cfb\u56fe\u8868\u793a\u672a\u7f16\u8f91\u5143\u7d20\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\u548c\u5927\u5c0f\u5173\u7cfb\u4f5c\u4e3a\u5e03\u5c40\u7ed3\u6784\u7ea6\u675f\uff1b2\uff09\u63d0\u51fa\u5173\u7cfb\u611f\u77e5\u8bbe\u8ba1\u91cd\u5efa\uff08RADR\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4ece\u5143\u7d20\u3001\u5173\u7cfb\u56fe\u548c\u5408\u6210\u7f16\u8f91\u64cd\u4f5c\u4e2d\u5b66\u4e60\u91cd\u5efa\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u4ee5\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u65b9\u5f0f\u6a21\u62df\u7f16\u8f91\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff1b3\uff09\u4f7f\u7528\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4f5c\u4e3aRADR\u4e3b\u5e72\uff0c\u7edf\u4e00\u591a\u79cd\u7f16\u8f91\u64cd\u4f5c\u3002", "result": "\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u5b9a\u91cf\u7ed3\u679c\u4ee5\u53ca\u7528\u6237\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0cReLayout\u5728\u7f16\u8f91\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u5e03\u5c40\u7ed3\u6784\u4fdd\u6301\u65b9\u9762\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "conclusion": "ReLayout\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u65e0\u9700\u4e09\u5143\u7ec4\u6570\u636e\u7684\u591a\u529f\u80fd\u3001\u7ed3\u6784\u4fdd\u6301\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5e03\u5c40\u7f16\u8f91\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5173\u7cfb\u56fe\u548c\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u7f16\u8f91\u64cd\u4f5c\u6b67\u4e49\u548c\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002"}}

Existing mitigation approaches primarily rely on either external post-hoc verification or mapping uncertainty directly to abstention during fine-tuning, often resulting in overly conservative behavior.

VeriFY augments training with structured verification traces that guide the model to produce an initial answer, generate and answer a probing verification query, issue a consistency judgment, and then decide whether to answer or abstain. To address the risk of reinforcing hallucinated content when training on augmented traces, we introduce a stage-level loss masking approach that excludes hallucinated answer stages from the training objective while preserving supervision over verification behavior. Across multiple model families and scales, VeriFY reduces factual hallucination rates by 9.7 to 53.3 percent, with only modest reductions in recall (0.4 to 5.7 percent), and generalizes across datasets when trained on a single source.

By effectively balancing the model's intrinsic capabilities with external guidance, our approach simultaneously preserves utility and enhances output safety. It demonstrates clear advantages in training overhead and generalization across model scales, offering a new perspective on lightweight alignment for the safe and practical deployment of large language models.

Existing knowledge editing approaches emphasize atomic facts, improving factual recall but often failing to integrate new information into a coherent framework usable across contexts. In this work, we argue that knowledge internalization is fundamentally a reasoning problem rather than a memorization problem. Consequently, a model should be trained in situations where the new information is instrumental to solving a task, combined with pre-existing knowledge, and exercised through multi-step reasoning. Based on this insight, we propose a training strategy based on three principles. First, new knowledge is introduced as a coherent background story that contextualizes novel facts and explains their relation to existing knowledge. Second, models are trained using self-generated multi-hop questions that require multi-step reasoning involving the new information. Third, training is done using knowledge distillation, forcing a student model to internalize the teacher's reasoning behavior without access to the novel information. Experiments show that models trained with this strategy effectively leverage newly acquired knowledge during reasoning and achieve remarkable performance on challenging questions that require combining multiple new facts.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\u5185\u5316\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u80cc\u666f\u6545\u4e8b\u3001\u591a\u8df3\u95ee\u9898\u548c\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\uff0c\u4f7fAI\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u5c06\u65b0\u77e5\u8bc6\u6574\u5408\u5230\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u4ec5\u662f\u8bb0\u5fc6\u4e8b\u5b9e\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u77e5\u8bc6\u7f16\u8f91\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u539f\u5b50\u4e8b\u5b9e\u7684\u8bb0\u5fc6\uff0c\u4f46\u65e0\u6cd5\u5c06\u65b0\u77e5\u8bc6\u6574\u5408\u5230\u8fde\u8d2f\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\u5e76\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4e2d\u7075\u6d3b\u5e94\u7528\u3002\u77e5\u8bc6\u5185\u5316\u672c\u8d28\u4e0a\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u63a8\u7406\u95ee\u9898\u800c\u975e\u8bb0\u5fc6\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e09\u4e2a\u539f\u5219\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\uff1a1) \u5c06\u65b0\u77e5\u8bc6\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8fde\u8d2f\u7684\u80cc\u666f\u6545\u4e8b\u5f15\u5165\uff0c\u89e3\u91ca\u65b0\u4e8b\u5b9e\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u77e5\u8bc6\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff1b2) \u4f7f\u7528\u81ea\u751f\u6210\u7684\u591a\u8df3\u95ee\u9898\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u8981\u6c42\u591a\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\u6d89\u53ca\u65b0\u4fe1\u606f\uff1b3) \u901a\u8fc7\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u5f3a\u5236\u5b66\u751f\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u5316\u6559\u5e08\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u884c\u4e3a\u800c\u4e0d\u8bbf\u95ee\u65b0\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u8be5\u7b56\u7565\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528\u65b0\u83b7\u53d6\u7684\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u5728\u9700\u8981\u7ed3\u5408\u591a\u4e2a\u65b0\u4e8b\u5b9e\u7684\u6311\u6218\u6027\u95ee\u9898\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u77e5\u8bc6\u5185\u5316\u89c6\u4e3a\u63a8\u7406\u95ee\u9898\u5e76\u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u80cc\u666f\u6545\u4e8b\u3001\u591a\u8df3\u95ee\u9898\u548c\u77e5\u8bc6\u84b8\u998f\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u4f7fAI\u6a21\u578b\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u6574\u5408\u548c\u5e94\u7528\u65b0\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u77e5\u8bc6\u7f16\u8f91\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002"}}

By adapting the principles of Elliptical Weighted Average (EWA) splatting to a modern differentiable pipeline, 3DGS enables real-time, high-quality novel view synthesis. Building upon this, R2-Gaussian extended the 3DGS paradigm to tomographic reconstruction by rectifying integration bias, achieving state-of-the-art performance in computed tomography (CT). To enable differentiability, R2-Gaussian adopts a local affine approximation: each 3D Gaussian is locally mapped to a 2D Gaussian on the detector and composed via alpha blending to form projections. However, the affine approximation can degrade reconstruction quantitative accuracy and complicate the incorporation of nonlinear geometric corrections. To address these limitations, we propose a tomographic reconstruction framework based on 3D Gaussian ray tracing. Our approach provides two key advantages over splatting-based models: (i) it computes the line integral through 3D Gaussian primitives analytically, avoiding the local affine collapse and thus yielding a more physically consistent forward projection model; and (ii) the ray-tracing formulation gives explicit control over ray origins and directions, which facilitates the precise application of nonlinear geometric corrections, e.g., arc-correction used in positron emission tomography (PET).

However, many agentic architectures rely primarily on prompt engineering of a single agent, making it difficult to observe or compare how models handle uncertainty and coordination across interconnected decision stages and with human oversight. We introduce a multi-agent system formalized as a finite-horizon Markov Decision Process (MDP) with a directed acyclic structure. Each agent corresponds to a specific role or decision stage (e.g., content, business, or legal review in a compliance workflow), with predefined transitions representing task escalation or completion. Epistemic uncertainty is quantified at the agent level using Monte Carlo estimation, while system-level uncertainty is captured by the MDP's termination in either an automated labeled state or a human-review state. We illustrate the approach through a case study in AI safety evaluation for self-harm detection, implemented as a multi-agent compliance system. Results demonstrate improvements over a single-agent baseline, including up to a 19\\% increase in accuracy, up to an 85x reduction in required human review, and, in some configurations, reduced processing time.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6709\u9650\u65f6\u57df\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u51b3LLM\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5728\u5408\u89c4\u5ba1\u67e5\u7b49\u53d7\u76d1\u7ba1\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u534f\u8c03\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u5355\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u57fa\u7ebf\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3001\u4eba\u5de5\u5ba1\u6838\u9700\u6c42\u548c\u5904\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u6709\u663e\u8457\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u57fa\u4e8e\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5728\u5408\u89c4\u5ba1\u67e5\u3001\u5c3d\u804c\u8c03\u67e5\u7b49\u53d7\u76d1\u7ba1\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u6267\u884c\u590d\u6742\u591a\u6b65\u9aa4\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u65f6\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u5355\u4e2a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u5de5\u7a0b\uff0c\u96be\u4ee5\u89c2\u5bdf\u6216\u6bd4\u8f83\u6a21\u578b\u5982\u4f55\u5904\u7406\u8de8\u51b3\u7b56\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u534f\u8c03\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e0e\u4eba\u5de5\u76d1\u7763\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u4e00\u4e2a\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u4e3a\u6709\u9650\u65f6\u57df\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u51b3\u7b56\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u6709\u5411\u65e0\u73af\u7ed3\u6784\u3002\u6bcf\u4e2a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5bf9\u5e94\u7279\u5b9a\u89d2\u8272\u6216\u51b3\u7b56\u9636\u6bb5\uff08\u5982\u5408\u89c4\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u4e2d\u7684\u5185\u5bb9\u3001\u4e1a\u52a1\u6216\u6cd5\u5f8b\u5ba1\u67e5\uff09\uff0c\u9884\u5b9a\u4e49\u8f6c\u6362\u8868\u793a\u4efb\u52a1\u5347\u7ea7\u6216\u5b8c\u6210\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u8499\u7279\u5361\u6d1b\u4f30\u8ba1\u5728\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5c42\u9762\u91cf\u5316\u8ba4\u77e5\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u7ea7\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u901a\u8fc7MDP\u5728\u81ea\u52a8\u6807\u8bb0\u72b6\u6001\u6216\u4eba\u5de5\u5ba1\u6838\u72b6\u6001\u7684\u7ec8\u6b62\u6765\u6355\u83b7\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7AI\u5b89\u5168\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u81ea\u6b8b\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u5b9e\u65bd\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5408\u89c4\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\u76f8\u6bd4\u5355\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u57fa\u7ebf\u6709\u663e\u8457\u6539\u8fdb\uff1a\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u63d0\u9ad8\u9ad8\u8fbe19%\uff0c\u6240\u9700\u4eba\u5de5\u5ba1\u6838\u51cf\u5c11\u9ad8\u8fbe85\u500d\uff0c\u67d0\u4e9b\u914d\u7f6e\u4e0b\u5904\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\u4e5f\u51cf\u5c11\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u591a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53MDP\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u53d7\u76d1\u7ba1\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u4e2d\u7684LLM\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u900f\u660e\u3001\u53ef\u89c2\u5bdf\u7684\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u534f\u8c03\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3001\u6548\u7387\u548c\u4eba\u5de5\u76d1\u7763\u9700\u6c42\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u5355\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Although deep neural networks provide flexible nonparametric estimators, unconstrained empirical risk minimization often leads to unstable solutions and poor generalization. In this work, image segmentation is formulated as a PDE-constrained optimization problem that integrates physically motivated priors into deep learning models through variational regularization. The proposed framework minimizes a composite objective function consisting of a data fidelity term and penalty terms derived from reaction-diffusion equations and phase-field interface energies, all implemented as differentiable residual losses. Experiments are conducted on the LIVECell dataset, a high-quality, manually annotated collection of phase-contrast microscopy images. Training is performed on two cell types, while evaluation is carried out on a distinct, unseen cell type to assess generalization. A UNet architecture is used as the unconstrained baseline model. Experimental results demonstrate consistent improvements in segmentation accuracy and boundary fidelity compared to unconstrained deep learning baselines. Moreover, the PDE-regularized models exhibit enhanced stability and improved generalization in low-sample regimes, highlighting the advantages of incorporating structured priors. The proposed approach illustrates how PDE-constrained optimization can strengthen data-driven learning frameworks, providing a principled bridge between variational methods, statistical learning, and scientific machine learning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8ePDE\u7ea6\u675f\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u7269\u7406\u5148\u9a8c\u901a\u8fc7\u53d8\u5206\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u6574\u5408\u5230\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\uff0c\u5728\u663e\u5fae\u955c\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u76f8\u6bd4\u65e0\u7ea6\u675f\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u5206\u5272\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3001\u8fb9\u754c\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u663e\u5fae\u955c\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u9762\u4e34\u6d4b\u91cf\u566a\u58f0\u3001\u5f31\u8fb9\u754c\u548c\u6709\u9650\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u7b49\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u65e0\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u5bb9\u6613\u4ea7\u751f\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u89e3\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u5dee\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u9700\u8981\u5c06\u7269\u7406\u5148\u9a8c\u6574\u5408\u5230\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u5206\u5272\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u5272\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3aPDE\u7ea6\u675f\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53d8\u5206\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u5c06\u53cd\u5e94-\u6269\u6563\u65b9\u7a0b\u548c\u76f8\u573a\u754c\u9762\u80fd\u91cf\u7b49\u7269\u7406\u5148\u9a8c\u6574\u5408\u5230\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u53ef\u5fae\u5206\u6b8b\u5dee\u635f\u5931\u5b9e\u73b0\u6570\u636e\u4fdd\u771f\u9879\u548c\u60e9\u7f5a\u9879\u7684\u7ec4\u5408\u76ee\u6807\u51fd\u6570\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u3002", "result": "\u5728LIVECell\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u65e0\u7ea6\u675f\u7684UNet\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\uff0cPDE\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5206\u5272\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u8fb9\u754c\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u65b9\u9762\u6709\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u5728\u4f4e\u6837\u672c\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "PDE\u7ea6\u675f\u4f18\u5316\u4e3a\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u539f\u5219\u6027\u6865\u6881\uff0c\u5c06\u53d8\u5206\u65b9\u6cd5\u3001\u7edf\u8ba1\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u79d1\u5b66\u673a\u5668\u5b66\u4e60\u6709\u673a\u7ed3\u5408\uff0c\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u5148\u9a8c\u5728\u63d0\u5347\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u4f18\u52bf\u3002"}}

In this work, we discover that attention scores of non-critical blocks exhibit distributional stability, allowing them to be approximated accurately and efficiently rather than discarded, which is essentially important for sparse attention design. Motivated by this key insight, we propose PISA, a training-free Piecewise Sparse Attention that covers the full attention span with sub-quadratic complexity. Unlike the conventional keep-or-drop paradigm that directly drop the non-critical block information, PISA introduces a novel exact-or-approximate strategy: it maintains exact computation for critical blocks while efficiently approximating the remainder through block-wise Taylor expansion. This design allows PISA to serve as a faithful proxy to full attention, effectively bridging the gap between speed and quality. Experimental results demonstrate that PISA achieves 1.91 times and 2.57 times speedups on Wan2.1-14B and Hunyuan-Video, respectively, while consistently maintaining the highest quality among sparse attention methods. Notably, even for image generation on FLUX, PISA achieves a 1.2 times acceleration without compromising visual quality.

However, the reliance on Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) on simplistic and fragmented datasets has hindered the development of models capable of plausible reasoning and robust multimodal generalization. To overcome this, we introduce MedAD-38K, the first large-scale, multi-modal, and multi-center benchmark for MedAD featuring diagnostic Chain-of-Thought (CoT) annotations alongside structured Visual Question-Answering (VQA) pairs. On this foundation, we propose a two-stage training framework. The first stage, Cognitive Injection, uses SFT to instill foundational medical knowledge and align the model with a structured think-then-answer paradigm. Given that standard policy optimization can produce reasoning that is disconnected from the final answer, the second stage incorporates Consistency Group Relative Policy Optimization (Con-GRPO). This novel algorithm incorporates a crucial consistency reward to ensure the generated reasoning process is relevant and logically coherent with the final diagnosis. Our proposed model, MedAD-R1, achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on the MedAD-38K benchmark, outperforming strong baselines by more than 10\\%.

While existing concept erasure approaches primarily focus on DDPM-based diffusion models and rely on costly fine-tuning, the recent emergence of flow matching models introduces a fundamentally different generative paradigm for which prior methods are not directly applicable. In this paper, we propose Differential Vector Erasure (DVE), a training-free concept erasure method specifically designed for flow matching models. Our key insight is that semantic concepts are implicitly encoded in the directional structure of the velocity field governing the generative flow. Leveraging this observation, we construct a differential vector field that characterizes the directional discrepancy between a target concept and a carefully chosen anchor concept. During inference, DVE selectively removes concept-specific components by projecting the velocity field onto the differential direction, enabling precise concept suppression without affecting irrelevant semantics. Extensive experiments on FLUX demonstrate that DVE consistently outperforms existing baselines on a wide range of concept erasure tasks, including NSFW suppression, artistic style removal, and object erasure, while preserving image quality and diversity.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faDVE\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u6a21\u578b\u6982\u5ff5\u64e6\u9664\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u901f\u5ea6\u573a\u4e2d\u7684\u65b9\u5411\u7ed3\u6784\u5dee\u5f02\u6765\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u79fb\u9664\u7279\u5b9a\u6982\u5ff5", "motivation": "\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u7136\u80fd\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u4f46\u4f1a\u590d\u5236\u4e0d\u826f\u6982\u5ff5\uff08\u5982NSFW\u5185\u5bb9\u3001\u7248\u6743\u98ce\u683c\u7b49\uff09\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u6982\u5ff5\u64e6\u9664\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u9488\u5bf9DDPM\u6a21\u578b\u4e14\u9700\u8981\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u800c\u65b0\u5174\u7684\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u6a21\u578b\u9700\u8981\u4e13\u95e8\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5dee\u5206\u5411\u91cf\u64e6\u9664(DVE)\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a1\uff09\u53d1\u73b0\u8bed\u4e49\u6982\u5ff5\u7f16\u7801\u5728\u901f\u5ea6\u573a\u7684\u65b9\u5411\u7ed3\u6784\u4e2d\uff1b2\uff09\u6784\u5efa\u5dee\u5206\u5411\u91cf\u573a\u6765\u8868\u5f81\u76ee\u6807\u6982\u5ff5\u4e0e\u951a\u6982\u5ff5\u7684\u65b9\u5411\u5dee\u5f02\uff1b3\uff09\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u901f\u5ea6\u573a\u6295\u5f71\u5230\u5dee\u5206\u65b9\u5411\u6765\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u79fb\u9664\u6982\u5ff5\u7279\u5b9a\u7ec4\u4ef6", "result": "\u5728FLUX\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u7684\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cDVE\u5728NSFW\u6291\u5236\u3001\u827a\u672f\u98ce\u683c\u79fb\u9664\u548c\u5bf9\u8c61\u64e6\u9664\u7b49\u5e7f\u6cdb\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u56fe\u50cf\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u591a\u6837\u6027", "conclusion": "DVE\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u4e13\u95e8\u4e3a\u6d41\u5339\u914d\u6a21\u578b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u65e0\u9700\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u64e6\u9664\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u901f\u5ea6\u573a\u4e2d\u7684\u65b9\u5411\u7ed3\u6784\u5dee\u5f02\u5b9e\u73b0\u7cbe\u786e\u6982\u5ff5\u6291\u5236\uff0c\u4e3a\u5b89\u5168\u53ef\u63a7\u7684\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u90e8\u7f72\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848"}}

Masked diffusion-based language models (MDMs) exhibit this failure in a much weaker form, but the underlying reason has remained unclear. A common explanation attributes this mitigation to the any-order training objective. However, observing \"[MASK] is $B$\" during training does not necessarily teach the model to handle the reverse prompt \"$B$ is [MASK]\". We show that the mitigation arises from architectural structure and its interaction with training. In a one-layer Transformer encoder, weight sharing couples the two directions by making forward and reverse attention scores positively correlated. In the same setting, we further show that the corresponding gradients are aligned, so minimizing the forward loss also reduces the reverse loss.

Existing methods typically establish a direct joint-to-joint mapping from 2D to 3D poses based on 2D features. This formulation suffers from two fundamental limitations: inevitable error propagation from input predicted 2D pose to 3D predictions and inherent difficulties in handling self-occlusion cases. In this paper, we propose PandaPose, a 3D human pose lifting approach via propagating 2D pose prior to 3D anchor space as the unified intermediate representation. Specifically, our 3D anchor space comprises: (1) Joint-wise 3D anchors in the canonical coordinate system, providing accurate and robust priors to mitigate 2D pose estimation inaccuracies. (2) Depth-aware joint-wise feature lifting that hierarchically integrates depth information to resolve self-occlusion ambiguities. (3) The anchor-feature interaction decoder that incorporates 3D anchors with lifted features to generate unified anchor queries encapsulating joint-wise 3D anchor set, visual cues and geometric depth information. The anchor queries are further employed to facilitate anchor-to-joint ensemble prediction. Experiments on three well-established benchmarks (i.e., Human3.6M, MPI-INF-3DHP and 3DPW) demonstrate the superiority of our proposition.

Existing datasets used for safety alignment for an LRM are usually constructed by distilling safety reasoning traces and answers from an external LRM or human labeler. However, such reasoning traces and answers exhibit a distributional gap with the target LRM that needs alignment, and we conjecture such distributional gap is the culprit leading to significant degradation of reasoning ability of the target LRM. Driven by this hypothesis, we propose a safety alignment dataset construction method, dubbed DGR. DGR transforms and refines an existing out-of-distributional safety reasoning dataset to be aligned with the target's LLM inner distribution. Experimental results demonstrate that i) DGR effectively mitigates the safety tax while maintaining safety performance across all baselines, i.e., achieving \\textbf{+30.2\\%} on DirectRefusal and \\textbf{+21.2\\%} on R1-ACT improvement in average reasoning accuracy compared to Vanilla SFT; ii) the degree of reasoning degradation correlates with the extent of distribution shift, suggesting that bridging this gap is central to preserving capabilities. Furthermore, we find that safety alignment in LRMs may primarily function as a mechanism to activate latent knowledge, as a mere \\textbf{10} samples are sufficient for activating effective refusal behaviors.

However, they can be harmful and can be used to disseminate hate toward targeted individuals or groups. Although previous studies have focused on designing new detection methods, these often rely on modal-complete data, such as text and images. In real-world settings, however, modalities like text may be missing due to issues like poor OCR quality, making existing methods sensitive to missing information and leading to performance deterioration. To address this gap, in this paper, we present the first-of-its-kind work to comprehensively investigate the behavior of harmful meme detection methods in the presence of modal-incomplete data. Specifically, we propose a new baseline method that learns a shared representation for multiple modalities by projecting them independently. These shared representations can then be leveraged when data is modal-incomplete. Experimental results on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms existing approaches when text is missing. Moreover, these results suggest that our method allows for better integration of visual features, reducing dependence on text and improving robustness in scenarios where textual information is missing.

We provide solver-annotated solutions and comprehensively evaluate LLMs by feasibility, solution optimality, and reasoning efficiency. Experiments across a wide range of modern LLMs show that high-performing models achieve strong feasibility and solution quality on small instances, but both degrade as instance size grows, even if more tokens are used for reasoning.

We propose Koo-Fu CLIP, a supervised CLIP adaptation method based on Fukunaga-Koontz Linear Discriminant Analysis, which operates in a whitened embedding space to suppress within-class variation and enhance between-class discrimination. The resulting closed-form linear projection reshapes the geometry of CLIP embeddings, improving class separability while performing effective dimensionality reduction, and provides a lightweight and efficient adaptation of CLIP representations.\n  Across large-scale ImageNet benchmarks, nearest visual prototype classification in the Koo-Fu CLIP space improves top-1 accuracy from 75.1% to 79.1% on ImageNet-1K, with consistent gains persisting as the label space expands to 14K and 21K classes. The method supports substantial compression by up to 10-12x with little or no loss in accuracy, enabling efficient large-scale classification and retrieval.", "AI": {"tldr": "Koo-Fu CLIP\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eFukunaga-Koontz\u7ebf\u6027\u5224\u522b\u5206\u6790\u7684\u76d1\u7763\u5f0fCLIP\u9002\u914d\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u767d\u5316\u5d4c\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u6291\u5236\u7c7b\u5185\u53d8\u5316\u5e76\u589e\u5f3a\u7c7b\u95f4\u533a\u5206\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5206\u7c7b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u964d\u7ef4\u3002", "motivation": "CLIP\u7b49\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u901a\u7528\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u539f\u59cb\u5d4c\u5165\u5728\u76d1\u7763\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u7c7b\u95f4\u5206\u79bb\u6709\u9650\u548c\u7ef4\u5ea6\u5197\u4f59\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4f18\u5316\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u5206\u7c7b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faKoo-Fu CLIP\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8eFukunaga-Koontz\u7ebf\u6027\u5224\u522b\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u5728\u767d\u5316\u5d4c\u5165\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u64cd\u4f5c\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c01\u95ed\u5f62\u5f0f\u7684\u7ebf\u6027\u6295\u5f71\u91cd\u5851CLIP\u5d4c\u5165\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u6291\u5236\u7c7b\u5185\u53d8\u5316\u5e76\u589e\u5f3a\u7c7b\u95f4\u533a\u5206\u3002", "result": "\u5728ImageNet\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cKoo-Fu CLIP\u5c06ImageNet-1K\u7684top-1\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4ece75.1%\u63d0\u5347\u81f379.1%\uff0c\u5728\u6269\u5c55\u523014K\u548c21K\u7c7b\u522b\u65f6\u4ecd\u4fdd\u6301\u4e00\u81f4\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u652f\u630110-12\u500d\u7684\u538b\u7f29\u800c\u51e0\u4e4e\u4e0d\u635f\u5931\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "Koo-Fu CLIP\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u8f7b\u91cf\u9ad8\u6548\u7684CLIP\u8868\u793a\u9002\u914d\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\u4e86\u7c7b\u95f4\u53ef\u5206\u79bb\u6027\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u6709\u6548\u7684\u964d\u7ef4\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5206\u7c7b\u548c\u68c0\u7d22\u4efb\u52a1\u3002"}}

To address these gaps, we propose Test-time Improvement Diagnostic Evaluation (TIDE), an agent-agnostic and environment-agnostic framework that decomposes TTI into three comprehensive and interconnected dimensions. The framework measures (1) the overall temporal dynamics of task completion and (2) identifies whether performance is primarily constrained by recursive looping behaviors or (3) by burdensome accumulated memory. Through extensive experiments across diverse agents and environments, TIDE highlights that improving agent performance requires more than scaling internal reasoning, calling for explicitly optimizing the interaction dynamics between the agent and the environment.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86TIDE\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bca\u65ad\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30LLM\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u5728\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u6539\u8fdb\uff08TTI\uff09\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u4e2a\u7ef4\u5ea6\u5206\u6790\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4e0e\u73af\u5883\u4ea4\u4e92\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u5bf9\u81ea\u4e3bLLM\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u6539\u8fdb\uff08TTI\uff09\u7684\u6210\u529f\u4e0e\u5931\u8d25\u673a\u5236\u7406\u89e3\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u65e0\u6cd5\u6355\u6349\u4efb\u52a1\u4f18\u5316\u6548\u7387\u3001\u9519\u8bef\u884c\u4e3a\u540e\u7684\u9002\u5e94\u80fd\u529b\u4ee5\u53ca\u5de5\u4f5c\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7684\u5177\u4f53\u6548\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u6539\u8fdb\u8bca\u65ad\u8bc4\u4f30\uff08TIDE\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u65e0\u5173\u548c\u73af\u5883\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06TTI\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u4e09\u4e2a\u7efc\u5408\u4e14\u76f8\u4e92\u5173\u8054\u7684\u7ef4\u5ea6\uff1a\u4efb\u52a1\u5b8c\u6210\u7684\u6574\u4f53\u65f6\u95f4\u52a8\u6001\u3001\u9012\u5f52\u5faa\u73af\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u7ea6\u675f\u7a0b\u5ea6\u4ee5\u53ca\u7d2f\u79ef\u8bb0\u5fc6\u8d1f\u62c5\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u548c\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0cTIDE\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u63d0\u5347\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6027\u80fd\u4e0d\u4ec5\u9700\u8981\u6269\u5c55\u5185\u90e8\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u8fd8\u9700\u8981\u663e\u5f0f\u4f18\u5316\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4e0e\u73af\u5883\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\u52a8\u6001\u3002", "conclusion": "TIDE\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3LLM\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u6d4b\u8bd5\u65f6\u6539\u8fdb\u673a\u5236\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u7684\u8bca\u65ad\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u4f18\u5316\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u4e0e\u73af\u5883\u4ea4\u4e92\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u4ec5\u4ec5\u662f\u589e\u5f3a\u5185\u90e8\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u3002"}}

However, despite their success in controlled environments, reliable real-world deployment is severely hindered by their fragility to visual disturbances. While existing literature extensively addresses physical occlusions caused by scene geometry, a critical mode remains largely unexplored: image corruptions. These sensor-level artifacts, ranging from electronic noise and dead pixels to lens contaminants, directly compromise the integrity of the visual signal prior to interpretation. In this work, we quantify this vulnerability, demonstrating that state-of-the-art VLAs such as $\u03c0_{0.5}$ and SmolVLA, suffer catastrophic performance degradation, dropping from 90\\% success rates to as low as 2\\%, under common signal artifacts. To mitigate this, we introduce the Corruption Restoration Transformer (CRT), a plug-and-play and model-agnostic vision transformer designed to immunize VLA models against sensor disturbances. Leveraging an adversarial training objective, CRT restores clean observations from corrupted inputs without requiring computationally expensive fine-tuning of the underlying model. Extensive experiments across the LIBERO and Meta-World benchmarks demonstrate that CRT effectively recovers lost performance, enabling VLAs to maintain near-baseline success rates, even under severe visual corruption.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u9488\u5bf9VLA\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u5e72\u6270\u4e0b\u7684\u8106\u5f31\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u540d\u4e3aCRT\u7684\u5373\u63d2\u5373\u7528\u89c6\u89c9\u53d8\u6362\u5668\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4e0d\u5fae\u8c03\u5e95\u5c42\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u6062\u590d\u88ab\u7834\u574f\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u8f93\u5165\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347VLA\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524dVLA\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u7136\u5728\u53d7\u63a7\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u90e8\u7f72\u65f6\u5bf9\u89c6\u89c9\u5e72\u6270\uff08\u7279\u522b\u662f\u56fe\u50cf\u635f\u574f\uff09\u6781\u5176\u8106\u5f31\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u7269\u7406\u906e\u6321\uff0c\u800c\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u635f\u574f\uff08\u5982\u7535\u5b50\u566a\u58f0\u3001\u574f\u70b9\u3001\u955c\u5934\u6c61\u67d3\u7b49\uff09\u8fd9\u4e00\u5173\u952e\u95ee\u9898\u5c1a\u672a\u5f97\u5230\u5145\u5206\u63a2\u7d22\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faCorruption Restoration Transformer (CRT)\uff0c\u4e00\u79cd\u5373\u63d2\u5373\u7528\u3001\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u53d8\u6362\u5668\u3002\u91c7\u7528\u5bf9\u6297\u8bad\u7ec3\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u4ece\u635f\u574f\u7684\u8f93\u5165\u4e2d\u6062\u590d\u5e72\u51c0\u7684\u89c2\u6d4b\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5bf9\u5e95\u5c42VLA\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6602\u8d35\u7684\u5fae\u8c03\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684VLA\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982\u03c0\u2080.\u2085\u548cSmolVLA\uff09\u5728\u5e38\u89c1\u4fe1\u53f7\u635f\u574f\u4e0b\u6027\u80fd\u6025\u5267\u4e0b\u964d\uff08\u4ece90%\u6210\u529f\u7387\u964d\u81f32%\uff09\u3002CRT\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u6062\u590d\u4e22\u5931\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f7fVLA\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u4e25\u91cd\u89c6\u89c9\u635f\u574f\u4e0b\u4e5f\u80fd\u7ef4\u6301\u63a5\u8fd1\u57fa\u7ebf\u7684\u6210\u529f\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "CRT\u4e3aVLA\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u635f\u574f\u514d\u75ab\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u5c42\u9762\u5e72\u6270\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6f0f\u6d1e\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86VLA\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u90e8\u7f72\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u3002"}}

While investigating these phenomena have recently received attention, explaining their appearance is still overlooked. Classic explainable AI (XAI) methods can surface failures at a single checkpoint of a model, but they are structurally ill-suited to justify what changed internally across different checkpoints and which explanatory claims are warranted about that change. We take the position that behavioral shifts should be explained comparatively: the core target should be the intervention-induced shift between a reference model and an intervened model, rather than any single model in isolation. To this aim we formulate a Comparative XAI ($\u0394$-XAI) framework with a set of desiderata to be taken into account when designing proper explaining methods. To highlight how $\u0394$-XAI methods work, we introduce a set of possible pipelines, relate them to the desiderata, and provide a concrete $\u0394$-XAI experiment.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u6bd4\u8f83\u6027\u53ef\u89e3\u91caAI\u6846\u67b6\uff08\u0394-XAI\uff09\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89e3\u91ca\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5e72\u9884\u540e\u51fa\u73b0\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u9700\u8981\u6bd4\u8f83\u53c2\u8003\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u5e72\u9884\u6a21\u578b\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u5b64\u7acb\u5206\u6790\u5355\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u5fae\u8c03\u3001\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6216\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5b66\u4e60\u540e\u4f1a\u51fa\u73b0\u884c\u4e3a\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u867d\u7136\u8fd9\u4e9b\u73b0\u8c61\u53d7\u5230\u5173\u6ce8\uff0c\u4f46\u89e3\u91ca\u5176\u51fa\u73b0\u539f\u56e0\u4ecd\u88ab\u5ffd\u89c6\u3002\u4f20\u7edfXAI\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ea\u80fd\u5206\u6790\u5355\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u68c0\u67e5\u70b9\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u89e3\u91ca\u4e0d\u540c\u68c0\u67e5\u70b9\u95f4\u7684\u5185\u90e8\u53d8\u5316\u4ee5\u53ca\u54ea\u4e9b\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u4e3b\u5f20\u662f\u5408\u7406\u7684\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6bd4\u8f83\u6027\u53ef\u89e3\u91caAI\uff08\u0394-XAI\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9002\u5f53\u89e3\u91ca\u65b9\u6cd5\u65f6\u9700\u8003\u8651\u7684\u4e00\u7ec4\u671f\u671b\u7279\u6027\u3002\u4ecb\u7ecd\u4e86\u53ef\u80fd\u7684\u0394-XAI\u6d41\u7a0b\uff0c\u5c06\u5176\u4e0e\u671f\u671b\u7279\u6027\u5173\u8054\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5177\u4f53\u7684\u0394-XAI\u5b9e\u9a8c\u3002", "result": "\u8bba\u6587\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u0394-XAI\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u660e\u786e\u4e86\u6bd4\u8f83\u6027\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u539f\u5219\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5c06\u0394-XAI\u65b9\u6cd5\u5e94\u7528\u4e8e\u5b9e\u9645\u884c\u4e3a\u53d8\u5316\u5206\u6790\u7684\u5177\u4f53\u8def\u5f84\u3002", "conclusion": "\u884c\u4e3a\u53d8\u5316\u5e94\u8be5\u901a\u8fc7\u6bd4\u8f83\u6027\u65b9\u5f0f\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u6838\u5fc3\u76ee\u6807\u5e94\u8be5\u662f\u53c2\u8003\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u5e72\u9884\u6a21\u578b\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5e72\u9884\u8bf1\u5bfc\u53d8\u5316\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u5b64\u7acb\u5206\u6790\u4efb\u4f55\u5355\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u0394-XAI\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u6311\u6218\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Yet, the internal mechanisms driving these complex reasoning behaviors remain opaque. Existing interpretability approaches targeting reasoning either identify components (e.g., neurons) correlated with special textual patterns, or rely on human-annotated contrastive pairs to derive control vectors. Consequently, current methods struggle to precisely localize complex reasoning mechanisms or capture sequential influence from model internal workings to the reasoning outputs. In this paper, built on outcome-oriented and sequential-influence-aware principles, we focus on identifying components that have sequential contribution to reasoning behavior where outcomes are cumulated by long-range effects. We propose Integrated Policy Gradient (IPG), a novel framework that attributes reasoning behaviors to model's inner components by propagating compound outcome-based signals such as post reasoning accuracy backward through model inference trajectories.

However, we find that current MAD methods easily suffer from discussion inconsistency, LLMs fail to reach a coherent solution, due to the misalignment between their individual contexts.In this paper, we introduce a multi-LLM context learning method (M2CL) that learns a context generator for each agent, capable of dynamically generating context instructions per discussion round via automatic information organization and refinement. Specifically, inspired by our theoretical insights on the context instruction, M2CL train the generators to control context coherence and output discrepancies via a carefully crafted self-adaptive mechanism.It enables LLMs to avoid premature convergence on majority noise and progressively reach the correct consensus.

While recent approaches employ finetuning to extend prediction horizons, they remain constrained by the issues of catastrophic forgetting, error accumulation, and high training overhead. To address these limitations, we present a novel pipeline across pretraining, finetuning and forecasting to enhance long-context modeling while reducing computational overhead. First, we introduce an Efficient Multi-scale Transformer (EMFormer) to extract multi-scale features through a single convolution in both training and inference. Based on the new architecture, we further employ an accumulative context finetuning to improve temporal consistency without degrading short-term accuracy. Additionally, we propose a composite loss that dynamically balances different terms via a sinusoidal weighting, thereby adaptively guiding the optimization trajectory throughout pretraining and finetuning. Experiments show that our approach achieves strong performance in weather forecasting and extreme event prediction, substantially improving long-term forecast accuracy.

In this paper, we propose Med3D-R1, a reinforcement learning framework with a two-stage training process: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning (RL). During SFT stage, we introduce a residual alignment mechanism to bridge the gap between high-dimensional 3D features and textual embeddings, and an abnormality re-weighting strategy to emphasize clinically informative tokens and reduce structural bias in reports. In RL stage, we redesign the consistency reward to explicitly promote coherent, step-by-step diagnostic reasoning. We evaluate our method on medical multiple-choice visual question answering using two 3D diagnostic benchmarks, CT-RATE and RAD-ChestCT, where our model attains state-of-the-art accuracies of 41.92\\% on CT-RATE and 44.99\\% on RAD-ChestCT.

However, current methods only consider features from visual inputs, neglecting helpful semantic information from the text side. To address this issue, we propose a Text Refinement and Alignment (TRA) framework that effectively utilizes textual features from visual descriptions to complement the visual features as they are semantically rich. This is achieved by designing two new modules for the original point-supervised framework: a Point-based Text Refinement module (PTR) and a Point-based Multimodal Alignment module (PMA). Specifically, we first generate descriptions for video frames using a pre-trained multimodal model. Next, PTR refines the initial descriptions by leveraging point annotations together with multiple pre-trained models. PMA then projects all features into a unified semantic space and leverages a point-level multimodal feature contrastive learning to reduce the gap between visual and linguistic modalities. Last, the enhanced multi-modal features are fed into the action detector for precise localization. Extensive experimental results on five widely used benchmarks demonstrate the favorable performance of our proposed framework compared to several state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, our computational overhead analysis shows that the framework can run on a single 24 GB RTX 3090 GPU, indicating its practicality and scalability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6587\u672c\u7cbe\u70bc\u4e0e\u5bf9\u9f50\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u89c6\u9891\u63cf\u8ff0\u4e2d\u7684\u6587\u672c\u7279\u5f81\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u70b9\u76d1\u7763\u65f6\u5e8f\u52a8\u4f5c\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5728\u4e94\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u70b9\u76d1\u7763\u65f6\u5e8f\u52a8\u4f5c\u5b9a\u4f4d\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ec5\u8003\u8651\u89c6\u89c9\u8f93\u5165\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u6587\u672c\u4fa7\u7684\u6709\u7528\u8bed\u4e49\u4fe1\u606f\u3002\u4e3a\u4e86\u5728\u6807\u6ce8\u6210\u672c\u548c\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e4b\u95f4\u53d6\u5f97\u66f4\u597d\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5229\u7528\u6587\u672c\u7279\u5f81\u6765\u8865\u5145\u89c6\u89c9\u7279\u5f81\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6587\u672c\u7cbe\u70bc\u4e0e\u5bf9\u9f50\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u4e2a\u65b0\u6a21\u5757\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8e\u70b9\u7684\u6587\u672c\u7cbe\u70bc\u6a21\u5757\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u70b9\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u9f50\u6a21\u5757\u3002\u9996\u5148\u4f7f\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u89c6\u9891\u5e27\u63cf\u8ff0\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u5229\u7528\u70b9\u6807\u6ce8\u548c\u591a\u4e2a\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u7cbe\u70bc\u521d\u59cb\u63cf\u8ff0\uff0c\u6700\u540e\u901a\u8fc7\u70b9\u7ea7\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u7279\u5f81\u5bf9\u6bd4\u5b66\u4e60\u5c06\u7279\u5f81\u6295\u5f71\u5230\u7edf\u4e00\u8bed\u4e49\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4e94\u4e2a\u5e7f\u6cdb\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u4e8e\u591a\u79cd\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\u6846\u67b6\u53ef\u5728\u5355\u5f2024GB RTX 3090 GPU\u4e0a\u8fd0\u884c\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u548c\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528\u6587\u672c\u7279\u5f81\u8865\u5145\u89c6\u89c9\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6587\u672c\u7cbe\u70bc\u4e0e\u5bf9\u9f50\u6846\u67b6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u70b9\u76d1\u7763\u65f6\u5e8f\u52a8\u4f5c\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7cbe\u5ea6\u3002"}}

We introduce a prompting method that structures reasoning as discrete, semantically coherent thought steps, and show that models are able to reliably localize errors within this structure, while failing to do so in conventional, unstructured chain-of-thought reasoning. Motivated by how the human brain monitors errors at discrete decision points and resamples alternatives, we introduce Iterative Correction Sampling of Thoughts (Thought-ICS), a self-correction framework. Thought-ICS iteratively prompts the model to generate reasoning one discrete and complete thought at a time--where each thought represents a deliberate decision by the model--creating natural boundaries for precise error localization. Upon verification, the model localizes the first erroneous step, and the system backtracks to generate alternative reasoning from the last correct point. When asked to correct reasoning verified as incorrect by an oracle, Thought-ICS achieves 20-40% self-correction lift. In a completely autonomous setting without external verification, it outperforms contemporary self-correction baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51faThought-ICS\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u79bb\u6563\u5316\u601d\u7ef4\u6b65\u9aa4\u5b9e\u73b0\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u5b9a\u4f4d\u4e0e\u81ea\u6211\u4fee\u6b63\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u4f20\u7edf\u94fe\u5f0f\u601d\u7ef4\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u81ea\u6211\u4fee\u6b63\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u81ea\u6211\u4fee\u6b63\u80fd\u529b\u4ecd\u7136\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u63a2\u7d22\u6a21\u578b\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u660e\u786e\u8bc6\u522b\u9519\u8bef\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u6784\u5efa\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u81ea\u6211\u4fee\u6b63\u7684AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faThought-ICS\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u5c06\u63a8\u7406\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u4e3a\u79bb\u6563\u3001\u8bed\u4e49\u8fde\u8d2f\u7684\u601d\u7ef4\u6b65\u9aa4\uff1b\u8fed\u4ee3\u751f\u6210\u6bcf\u4e2a\u79bb\u6563\u601d\u7ef4\u6b65\u9aa4\uff1b\u9a8c\u8bc1\u65f6\u5b9a\u4f4d\u7b2c\u4e00\u4e2a\u9519\u8bef\u6b65\u9aa4\uff1b\u56de\u6eaf\u5230\u6700\u540e\u4e00\u4e2a\u6b63\u786e\u70b9\u751f\u6210\u66ff\u4ee3\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u601d\u7ef4\u6b65\u9aa4\u4e2d\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u53ef\u9760\u5b9a\u4f4d\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u800c\u5728\u4f20\u7edf\u975e\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u94fe\u5f0f\u601d\u7ef4\u4e2d\u5931\u8d25\uff1b\u4f7f\u7528oracle\u9a8c\u8bc1\u65f6\uff0cThought-ICS\u5b9e\u73b020-40%\u7684\u81ea\u6211\u4fee\u6b63\u63d0\u5347\uff1b\u5728\u5b8c\u5168\u81ea\u4e3b\u65e0\u5916\u90e8\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u5f53\u4ee3\u81ea\u6211\u4fee\u6b63\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u79bb\u6563\u5316\u601d\u7ef4\u6b65\u9aa4\u521b\u5efa\u81ea\u7136\u8fb9\u754c\uff0c\u4f7f\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u591f\u7cbe\u786e\u5b9a\u4f4d\u9519\u8bef\u5e76\u5b9e\u73b0\u6709\u6548\u7684\u81ea\u6211\u4fee\u6b63\uff0c\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u80fd\u81ea\u6211\u4fee\u6b63\u7684AI\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u8def\u5f84\u3002"}}

Nevertheless, incorrect grounding can result in costly, hard-to-reverse actions (e.g., erroneous payment approvals), raising concerns about model reliability. In this paper, we introduce SafeGround, an uncertainty-aware framework for GUI grounding models that enables risk-aware predictions through calibrations before testing. SafeGround leverages a distribution-aware uncertainty quantification method to capture the spatial dispersion of stochastic samples from outputs of any given model. Then, through the calibration process, SafeGround derives a test-time decision threshold with statistically guaranteed false discovery rate (FDR) control.

This shift has sparked interest in using intermediate visualizations as a reasoning aid, akin to human mental imagery. Central to this idea is the ability to form, maintain, and manipulate visual representations in a goal-oriented manner. To evaluate and probe this capability, we develop MentisOculi, a procedural, stratified suite of multi-step reasoning problems amenable to visual solution, tuned to challenge frontier models. Evaluating visual strategies ranging from latent tokens to explicit generated imagery, we find they generally fail to improve performance. Analysis of UMMs specifically exposes a critical limitation: While they possess the textual reasoning capacity to solve a task and can sometimes generate correct visuals, they suffer from compounding generation errors and fail to leverage even ground-truth visualizations. Our findings suggest that despite their inherent appeal, visual thoughts do not yet benefit model reasoning.

We study the problem from a physical and topological perspective: a 3D line most naturally emerges as the edge of a finite 3D planar patch. We present LiP-Map, a line-plane joint optimization framework that explicitly models learnable line and planar primitives. This coupling enables accurate and detailed 3D line mapping while maintaining strong efficiency (typically completing a reconstruction in 3 to 5 minutes per scene). LiP-Map pioneers the integration of planar topology into 3D line mapping, not by imposing pairwise coplanarity constraints but by explicitly constructing interactions between plane and line primitives, thus offering a principled route toward structured reconstruction in man-made environments. On more than 100 scenes from ScanNetV2, ScanNet++, Hypersim, 7Scenes, and Tanks\\&Temple, LiP-Map improves both accuracy and completeness over state-of-the-art methods.

Extensive prior research suggests that this failure is an inherent, fundamental limit of autoregressive causal LLMs, indicating that these models tend to memorize factual-level knowledge rather than capture higher-level rules. In this paper, we challenge this view by showing that this seemingly fundamental limit can be mitigated by slightly tweaking the training data with a simple regularization data recipe called the Identity Bridge of the form \"$A \\to A$\" (e.g., The name of Alice is Alice). Theoretically, we prove that under this recipe, even a one-layer transformer can break the reversal curse by analyzing the implicit bias of gradient descent. Empirically, we show that a 1B pretrained language model finetuned with the proposed data recipe achieves a 40% success rate on reversal tasks, in stark contrast to a near-zero success rate when trained solely on forward-knowledge data.

To address this task, we propose Reasoning-Enhanced Object Removal with MLLM (REORM), a reasoningenhanced object removal framework that leverages multimodal large language models to infer which elements must be jointly removed. REORM features a modular design that integrates MLLM-driven analysis, mask-guided removal, and a self-correction mechanism, along with a local-deployment variant that supports accurate editing under limited resources. To support evaluation, we introduce ICOREval, a benchmark consisting of instruction-driven removals with rich interaction dependencies.

We propose ReDiStory, a training-free framework that improves multi-frame story generation via inference-time prompt embedding reorganization. ReDiStory explicitly decomposes text embeddings into identity-related and frame-specific components, then decorrelates frame embeddings by suppressing shared directions across frames. This reduces cross-frame interference without modifying diffusion parameters or requiring additional supervision. Under identical diffusion backbones and inference settings, ReDiStory improves identity consistency while maintaining prompt fidelity.

Towards this end, we propose Disentangled Click-Through Rate prediction (DiseCTR), which introduces a causal perspective of recommendation and disentangles multiple aspects of user interests to alleviate the OOD issue in recommendation. We conduct a causal factorization of CTR prediction involving user interest, exposure model, and click model, based on which we develop a deep learning implementation for these three causal mechanisms. Specifically, we first design an interest encoder with sparse attention which maps raw features to user interests, and then introduce a weakly supervised interest disentangler to learn independent interest embeddings, which are further integrated by an attentive interest aggregator for prediction. Experimental results on three real-world datasets show that DiseCTR achieves the best accuracy and robustness in OOD recommendation against state-of-the-art approaches, significantly improving AUC and GAUC by over 0.02 and reducing logloss by over 13.7%. Further analyses demonstrate that DiseCTR successfully disentangles user interests, which is the key to OOD generalization for CTR prediction.

In multi-country deployments, diverse linguistic, cultural, and product catalog contexts introduce significant distribution shifts, posing substantial challenges to relevance modeling. Existing approaches typically enhance the reasoning or multilingual abilities of a single monolithic model, yet they remain limited by data diversity, coverage gaps, and high inference costs in heterogeneous environments. Our empirical analysis reveals that different LLM base models exhibit complementary strengths across languages and regions, motivating an expert-based architecture. We propose a scalable LLM-based Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) framework that dynamically routes queries to specialized experts and fuses their embeddings through concatenation. Among rule-based, pseudo-label-based, and fully end-to-end strategies, end-to-end hard routing with concatenation offers the best balance of effectiveness and efficiency. To mitigate inference overhead, we further develop an engineering-optimized offline batch pipeline with resource-efficient scheduling, which hides memory latency, improves GPU utilization, and reduces GPU-hour consumption by up to 35% compared with synchronous execution. On datasets spanning six Southeast Asian markets, our MoE improves AUC by 0.72 percentage points over a dense baseline with the same active parameters. Meanwhile, the optimized pipeline achieves 27.6 queries per second (QPS), a 9% throughput improvement.

Failing to account for the continuous evolution of modeling dynamics, existing VAR token reduction methods face three key limitations: heuristic stage partition, non-adaptive schedules, and limited acceleration scope, thereby leaving significant acceleration potential untapped. Since entropy variation intrinsically reflects the transition of predictive uncertainty, it offers a principled measure to capture modeling dynamics evolution. Therefore, we propose NOVA, a training-free token reduction acceleration framework for VAR models via entropy analysis. NOVA adaptively determines the acceleration activation scale during inference by online identifying the inflection point of scale entropy growth. Through scale-linkage and layer-linkage ratio adjustment, NOVA dynamically computes distinct token reduction ratios for each scale and layer, pruning low-entropy tokens while reusing the cache derived from the residuals at the prior scale to accelerate inference and maintain generation quality. Extensive experiments and analyses validate NOVA as a simple yet effective training-free acceleration framework.", "AI": {"tldr": "NOVA\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u71b5\u5206\u6790\u7684\u65e0\u8bad\u7ec3\u4ee4\u724c\u7f29\u51cf\u52a0\u901f\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u89c6\u89c9\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u786e\u5b9a\u52a0\u901f\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5c3a\u5ea6\u5e76\u52a8\u6001\u8ba1\u7b97\u5404\u5c3a\u5ea6\u548c\u5c42\u7684\u4ee4\u724c\u7f29\u51cf\u6bd4\u4f8b\u6765\u52a0\u901f\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709VAR\u4ee4\u724c\u7f29\u51cf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u9650\u5236\uff1a\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u9636\u6bb5\u5212\u5206\u3001\u975e\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8c03\u5ea6\u548c\u6709\u9650\u52a0\u901f\u8303\u56f4\uff0c\u672a\u80fd\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528\u52a0\u901f\u6f5c\u529b\u3002\u71b5\u53d8\u5316\u80fd\u53cd\u6620\u9884\u6d4b\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u8f6c\u53d8\uff0c\u4e3a\u6355\u6349\u5efa\u6a21\u52a8\u6001\u6f14\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u539f\u5219\u6027\u5ea6\u91cf\u3002", "method": "NOVA\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u7ebf\u8bc6\u522b\u5c3a\u5ea6\u71b5\u589e\u957f\u7684\u62d0\u70b9\u6765\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u786e\u5b9a\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u52a0\u901f\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5c3a\u5ea6\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5c3a\u5ea6\u94fe\u63a5\u548c\u5c42\u94fe\u63a5\u6bd4\u4f8b\u8c03\u6574\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u8ba1\u7b97\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u548c\u5c42\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u4ee4\u724c\u7f29\u51cf\u6bd4\u4f8b\uff0c\u526a\u679d\u4f4e\u71b5\u4ee4\u724c\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u91cd\u7528\u5148\u524d\u5c3a\u5ea6\u6b8b\u5dee\u6d3e\u751f\u7684\u7f13\u5b58\u6765\u52a0\u901f\u63a8\u7406\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "result": "\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u548c\u5206\u6790\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86NOVA\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e00\u4e2a\u7b80\u5355\u800c\u6709\u6548\u7684\u65e0\u8bad\u7ec3\u52a0\u901f\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "NOVA\u901a\u8fc7\u71b5\u5206\u6790\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u89c6\u89c9\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u65e0\u8bad\u7ec3\u4ee4\u724c\u7f29\u51cf\u52a0\u901f\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u52a0\u901f\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002"}}

In this paper, we introduce ChunkNorris, a novel heuristic-based technique designed to optimise the parsing and chunking of PDF documents. Our approach does not rely on machine learning and employs a suite of simple yet effective heuristics to achieve high performance with minimal computational overhead. We demonstrate the efficiency of ChunkNorris through a comprehensive benchmark against existing parsing and chunking methods, evaluating criteria such as execution time, energy consumption, and retrieval accuracy. We propose an open-access dataset to produce our results.

Though existing models have achieved significant fidelity, they still suffer from two core limitations: (i) They treat motion periodicity and keyframe saliency as independent factors, overlooking their coupling and causing generation drift in long sequences. (ii) They are fragile to semantically equivalent paraphrases, where minor synonym substitutions distort textual embeddings, propagating through the decoder and producing unstable or erroneous motions. In this work, we propose T2M Mamba to address these limitations by (i) proposing Periodicity-Saliency Aware Mamba, which utilizes novel algorithms for keyframe weight estimation via enhanced Density Peaks Clustering and motion periodicity estimation via FFT-accelerated autocorrelation to capture coupled dynamics with minimal computational overhead, and (ii) constructing a Periodic Differential Cross-modal Alignment Module (PDCAM) to enhance robust alignment of textual and motion embeddings.

Conventional manual approaches, although methodologically systematic, are resource-intensive and susceptible to subjectivity, whereas heuristic and automated techniques frequently under-perform in recall unless supplemented by extensive expert input. We introduce a Large Language Model (LLM)-based chained prompt engineering framework for the automated development of search strategies in systematic reviews. The framework replicates the procedural structure of manual search design while leveraging LLMs to decompose review objectives, extract and formalize PICO elements, generate conceptual representations, expand terminologies, and synthesize Boolean queries. In addition to query construction, the framework exhibits superior performance in generating well-structured PICO elements relative to existing methods, thereby strengthening the foundation for high-recall search strategies. Evaluation on a subset of the LEADSInstruct dataset demonstrates that the framework attains a 0.9 average recall. These results significantly exceed the performance of existing approaches. Error analysis further highlights the critical role of precise objective specification and terminological alignment in optimizing retrieval effectiveness.

Existing attack methods often treat MoE as a unified architecture, overlooking the independent and collaborative weaknesses of key components such as routers and expert modules. To fill this gap, we propose Temporal Lipschitz-Guided Attacks (TLGA) to thoroughly investigate component-level vulnerabilities in video MoE models. We first design attacks on the router, revealing its independent weaknesses. Building on this, we introduce Joint Temporal Lipschitz-Guided Attacks (J-TLGA), which collaboratively perturb both routers and experts. This joint attack significantly amplifies adversarial effects and exposes the Achilles' Heel (collaborative weaknesses) of the MoE architecture. Based on these insights, we further propose Joint Temporal Lipschitz Adversarial Training (J-TLAT). J-TLAT performs joint training to further defend against collaborative weaknesses, enhancing component-wise robustness. Our framework is plug-and-play and reduces inference cost by more than 60% compared with dense models.

However, existing approaches face two fundamental limitations. First, constructing and maintaining knowledge graphs for educational content largely depends on manual curation, resulting in high cost and poor scalability. Second, most personalized education systems lack effective support for state-aware and systematic reasoning over learners' knowledge, and therefore rely on static question banks with limited adaptability. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a Generative GraphRAG framework for automated knowledge modeling and personalized exercise generation. It consists of two core modules. The first module, Automated Hierarchical Knowledge Graph Constructor (Auto-HKG), leverages LLMs to automatically construct hierarchical knowledge graphs that capture structured concepts and their semantic relations from educational resources. The second module, Cognitive GraphRAG (CG-RAG), performs graph-based reasoning over a learner mastery graph and combines it with retrieval-augmented generation to produce personalized exercises that adapt to individual learning states.

In practice, Thompson Sampling (TS) is often initialized with a uniform Beta(1,1) prior, implicitly assuming a 50% success rate for unseen items. When true base rates are far lower, this optimistic prior systematically over-allocates to weak items. The impact is amplified by batched policy updates and pipeline latency: for hours, newly launched items can remain effectively \"no data,\" so the prior dominates allocation before feedback is incorporated. We propose Dynamic Prior Thompson Sampling, a prior design that directly controls the probability that a new arm outcompetes the incumbent winner. Our key contribution is a closed-form quadratic solution for the prior mean that enforces P(X_j > Y_k) = epsilon at introduction time, making exploration intensity predictable and tunable while preserving TS Bayesian updates.

When resilience weakens, students are at risk of disengagement and may drop out and miss on opportunities. Therefore, predicting disengagement long before it happens during the window of hope is important. In this article, we test whether early warning signals of resilience loss, grounded in the concept of critical slowing down (CSD) can forecast disengagement before dropping out. CSD has been widely observed across ecological, climate, and neural systems, where it precedes tipping points into catastrophic failure (dropping out in our case). Using 1.67 million practice attempts from 9,401 students who used a digital math learning environment, we computed CSD indicators: autocorrelation, return rate, variance, skewness, kurtosis, and coefficient of variation. We found that 88.2% of students exhibited CSD signals prior to disengagement, with warnings clustering late in activity and before practice ceased (dropping out). Our results provide the first evidence of CSD in education, suggesting that universal resilience dynamics also govern social systems such as human learning. These findings offer a practical indicator for early detection of vulnerability and supporting learners across different applications and contexts long before critical events happen. Most importantly, CSD indicators arise universally, independent of the mechanisms that generate the data, offering new opportunities for portability across contexts, data types, and learning environments.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u9996\u6b21\u5728\u6559\u80b2\u9886\u57df\u5e94\u7528\u4e34\u754c\u51cf\u901f\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790160\u4e07\u6b21\u6570\u5b66\u7ec3\u4e60\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u53d1\u73b088.2%\u5b66\u751f\u5728\u653e\u5f03\u5b66\u4e60\u524d\u4f1a\u51fa\u73b0\u4e34\u754c\u51cf\u901f\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u53ef\u4f5c\u4e3a\u65e9\u671f\u9884\u8b66\u6307\u6807\u3002", "motivation": "\u5b66\u751f\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u97e7\u6027\u548c\u575a\u6301\u80fd\u529b\u5bf9\u5b66\u4e60\u6210\u529f\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u5f53\u97e7\u6027\u51cf\u5f31\u65f6\uff0c\u5b66\u751f\u9762\u4e34\u8131\u79bb\u5b66\u4e60\u548c\u8f8d\u5b66\u7684\u98ce\u9669\u3002\u56e0\u6b64\uff0c\u5728\"\u5e0c\u671b\u7a97\u53e3\u671f\"\u9884\u6d4b\u5b66\u751f\u8131\u79bb\u5b66\u4e60\u975e\u5e38\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u6d4b\u8bd5\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e34\u754c\u51cf\u901f\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u65e9\u671f\u9884\u8b66\u4fe1\u53f7\u662f\u5426\u80fd\u9884\u6d4b\u5b66\u751f\u653e\u5f03\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u4f7f\u75289,401\u540d\u5b66\u751f\u5728\u6570\u5b57\u6570\u5b66\u5b66\u4e60\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7684167\u4e07\u6b21\u7ec3\u4e60\u6570\u636e\u3002\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e86\u4e34\u754c\u51cf\u901f\u6307\u6807\uff1a\u81ea\u76f8\u5173\u3001\u8fd4\u56de\u7387\u3001\u65b9\u5dee\u3001\u504f\u5ea6\u3001\u5cf0\u5ea6\u548c\u53d8\u5f02\u7cfb\u6570\u3002\u5206\u6790\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6307\u6807\u5728\u5b66\u751f\u653e\u5f03\u5b66\u4e60\u524d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002", "result": "88.2%\u7684\u5b66\u751f\u5728\u8131\u79bb\u5b66\u4e60\u524d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4e34\u754c\u51cf\u901f\u4fe1\u53f7\u3002\u8b66\u544a\u4fe1\u53f7\u96c6\u4e2d\u5728\u6d3b\u52a8\u540e\u671f\u548c\u505c\u6b62\u7ec3\u4e60\uff08\u8f8d\u5b66\uff09\u4e4b\u524d\u3002\u8fd9\u662f\u9996\u6b21\u5728\u6559\u80b2\u9886\u57df\u53d1\u73b0\u4e34\u754c\u51cf\u901f\u73b0\u8c61\u7684\u8bc1\u636e\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\u666e\u904d\u5b58\u5728\u7684\u97e7\u6027\u52a8\u6001\u4e5f\u652f\u914d\u7740\u4eba\u7c7b\u5b66\u4e60\u7b49\u793e\u4f1a\u7cfb\u7edf\u3002\u4e34\u754c\u51cf\u901f\u6307\u6807\u4e3a\u65e9\u671f\u68c0\u6d4b\u8106\u5f31\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u53ef\u5728\u5173\u952e\u4e8b\u4ef6\u53d1\u751f\u524d\u652f\u6301\u5b66\u4e60\u8005\u3002\u6700\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u662f\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6307\u6807\u5177\u6709\u666e\u904d\u6027\uff0c\u4e0d\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4e3a\u8de8\u60c5\u5883\u3001\u8de8\u6570\u636e\u7c7b\u578b\u548c\u5b66\u4e60\u73af\u5883\u7684\u53ef\u79fb\u690d\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u673a\u4f1a\u3002"}}

Recent methods rely on latent intrinsic representations but remain under-constrained and often fail on challenging materials such as metal and glass. A natural hypothesis is that stronger pretrained visual priors should resolve these failures. We find the opposite: features from top-performing semantic encoders often degrade relighting quality, revealing a fundamental trade-off between semantic abstraction and photometric fidelity. We study this trade-off and introduce Augmented Latent Intrinsics (ALI), which balances semantic context and dense photometric structure by fusing features from a pixel-aligned visual encoder into a latent-intrinsic framework, together with a self-supervised refinement strategy to mitigate the scarcity of paired real-world data. Trained only on unlabeled real-world image pairs and paired with a dense, pixel-aligned visual prior, ALI achieves strong improvements in relighting, with the largest gains on complex, specular materials.

Rather than prohibiting AI, this work argues that one way to integrate AI into education is by creating uncertain situations with the help of AI models and using thinking-oriented teaching approaches, where uncertainty is a central pedagogical concept for stimulating students critical thinking. Drawing on epistemology and critical thinking research studies, we propose designing learning activities and assessments around the inherent limitations of both AI models and instructors. This encourages students to reason, question, and justify their final answers. We show how explicitly controlling AI behavior during exams (such as preventing direct answers or generating plausible but flawed responses) prevents AI from becoming a shortcut to certainty. To support this pedagogy, we introduce MindMosaicAIExam, an exam system that integrates controllable AI tools and requires students to provide initial answers, critically evaluate AI outputs, and iteratively refine their reasoning. We also present an evaluation rubric designed to assess critical thinking based on students reasoning artifacts collected by the exam system.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u901a\u8fc7AI\u5236\u9020\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u60c5\u5883\u6765\u4fc3\u8fdb\u6279\u5224\u6027\u601d\u7ef4\u7684\u6559\u5b66\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86MindMosaicAIExam\u8003\u8bd5\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u8981\u6c42\u5b66\u751f\u5bf9AI\u8f93\u51fa\u8fdb\u884c\u6279\u5224\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u8fed\u4ee3\u3002", "motivation": "\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u8ba9\u5b66\u751f\u65e0\u9700\u7406\u89e3\u5c31\u80fd\u83b7\u5f97\u6b63\u786e\u7b54\u6848\uff0c\u6311\u6218\u4f20\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u5f0f\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u8ba4\u4e3a\u4e0d\u5e94\u7981\u6b62AI\uff0c\u800c\u5e94\u5c06\u5176\u6574\u5408\u5230\u6559\u80b2\u4e2d\uff0c\u5229\u7528AI\u5236\u9020\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u60c5\u5883\u6765\u6fc0\u53d1\u5b66\u751f\u7684\u6279\u5224\u6027\u601d\u7ef4\u3002", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u8ba4\u8bc6\u8bba\u548c\u6279\u5224\u6027\u601d\u7ef4\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u56f4\u7ed5AI\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u6559\u5e08\u7684\u56fa\u6709\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5b66\u4e60\u6d3b\u52a8\u548c\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u63a7\u5236AI\u884c\u4e3a\uff08\u5982\u963b\u6b62\u76f4\u63a5\u7b54\u6848\u6216\u751f\u6210\u770b\u4f3c\u5408\u7406\u4f46\u6709\u7f3a\u9677\u7684\u56de\u5e94\uff09\u6765\u9632\u6b62AI\u6210\u4e3a\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u6377\u5f84\u3002\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86MindMosaicAIExam\u8003\u8bd5\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u6574\u5408\u53ef\u63a7AI\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u8981\u6c42\u5b66\u751f\u63d0\u4f9b\u521d\u59cb\u7b54\u6848\u3001\u6279\u5224\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30AI\u8f93\u51fa\u5e76\u8fed\u4ee3\u5b8c\u5584\u63a8\u7406\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86MindMosaicAIExam\u8003\u8bd5\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u6536\u96c6\u5b66\u751f\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5e76\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e86\u8bc4\u4f30\u6279\u5224\u6027\u601d\u7ef4\u7684\u8bc4\u5206\u6807\u51c6\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u63a7\u5236AI\u884c\u4e3a\u521b\u9020\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u60c5\u5883\uff0c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u5b66\u751f\u8fdb\u884c\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u8d28\u7591\u548c\u8bba\u8bc1\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c06AI\u6574\u5408\u5230\u6559\u80b2\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u65b9\u6cd5\u662f\u901a\u8fc7AI\u5236\u9020\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u60c5\u5883\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4ee5\u601d\u7ef4\u4e3a\u5bfc\u5411\u7684\u6559\u5b66\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6fc0\u53d1\u6279\u5224\u6027\u601d\u7ef4\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u6559\u5b66\u6982\u5ff5\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u9f13\u52b1\u5b66\u751f\u8fdb\u884c\u63a8\u7406\u3001\u8d28\u7591\u548c\u8bba\u8bc1\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u662f\u7b80\u5355\u5730\u4f9d\u8d56AI\u83b7\u53d6\u6b63\u786e\u7b54\u6848\u3002"}}

Given a set of vision tokens-such as images, point clouds, videos, or event camera streams-our objective is to encode their positions while accounting for the characteristics of vision modalities. Prior works have largely extended position encodings from 1D-sequences in language to nD-structures in vision, but only with partial account of vision characteristics. We address this gap by designing PaPE from principles distilled from prior work: translation invariance, rotation invariance (PaPE-RI), distance decay, directionality, and context awareness. We evaluate PaPE on 8 datasets that span 4 modalities. We find that either PaPE or PaPE-RI achieves the top performance on 7 out of 8 datasets. Extrapolation experiments on ImageNet-1K show that PaPE extrapolates remarkably well, improving in absolute terms by up to 10.5% over the next-best position encoding.

Emotion-Driven Demographic Biases in Synthetic Face Generation", "comment": "23 pages, 11 figures", "summary": "Synthetic face generation has rapidly advanced with the emergence of text-to-image (T2I) and of multimodal large language models, enabling high-fidelity image production from natural-language prompts. Despite the widespread adoption of these tools, the biases, representational quality, and cross-cultural consistency of these models remain poorly understood. Prior research on biases in the synthetic generation of human faces has examined demographic biases, yet there is little research on how emotional prompts influence demographic representation and how models trained in different cultural and linguistic contexts vary in their output distributions. We present a systematic audit of eight state-of-the-art T2I models comprising four models developed by Western organizations and four developed by Chinese institutions, all prompted identically. Using state-of-the-art facial analysis algorithms, we estimate the gender, race, age, and attractiveness levels in the generated faces. To measure the deviations from global population statistics, we apply information-theoretic bias metrics including Kullback-Leibler and Jensen-Shannon divergences. Our findings reveal persistent demographic and emotion-conditioned biases in all models regardless of their country of origin.

This paper tackles this challenge as a semantic identification task from the road scenes captured by a vehicle's front-view camera. Specifically, the collocation of gaze points with object semantics is investigated using three distinct vision-based approaches: direct object detection (YOLOv13), segmentation-assisted classification (SAM2 paired with EfficientNetV2 versus YOLOv13), and query-based Vision-Language Models, VLMs (Qwen2.5-VL-7b versus Qwen2.5-VL-32b). The results demonstrate that the direct object detection (YOLOv13) and Qwen2.5-VL-32b significantly outperform other approaches, achieving Macro F1-Scores over 0.84. The large VLM (Qwen2.5-VL-32b), in particular, exhibited superior robustness and performance for identifying small, safety-critical objects such as traffic lights, especially in adverse nighttime conditions. Conversely, the segmentation-assisted paradigm suffers from a \"part-versus-whole\" semantic gap that led to large failure in recall. The results reveal a fundamental trade-off between the real-time efficiency of traditional detectors and the richer contextual understanding and robustness offered by large VLMs. These findings provide critical insights and practical guidance for the design of future human-aware intelligent driver monitoring systems.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u4e09\u79cd\u89c6\u89c9\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u76f4\u63a5\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\u3001\u5206\u5272\u8f85\u52a9\u5206\u7c7b\u3001\u67e5\u8be2\u5f0f\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff09\u5728\u9a7e\u9a76\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u8bc6\u522b\u9a7e\u9a76\u5458\u6ce8\u89c6\u70b9\u5bf9\u5e94\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u8c61\u7684\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0YOLOv13\u548cQwen2.5-VL-32b\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff0c\u540e\u8005\u5728\u591c\u95f4\u8bc6\u522b\u5c0f\u7269\u4f53\u65b9\u9762\u66f4\u5177\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "motivation": "\u7406\u89e3\u9a7e\u9a76\u5458\u5728\u9a7e\u9a76\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5206\u5e03\uff08\u901a\u8fc7\u6ce8\u89c6\u884c\u4e3a\u8868\u5f81\uff09\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5f00\u53d1\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3\u9ad8\u7ea7\u9a7e\u9a76\u8f85\u52a9\u7cfb\u7edf\u548c\u63d0\u9ad8\u9053\u8def\u5b89\u5168\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u4ece\u8f66\u8f86\u524d\u89c6\u6444\u50cf\u5934\u6355\u6349\u7684\u9053\u8def\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bed\u4e49\u8bc6\u522b\u4efb\u52a1\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u6311\u6218\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u91c7\u7528\u4e09\u79cd\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a1\uff09\u76f4\u63a5\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\uff08YOLOv13\uff09\uff1b2\uff09\u5206\u5272\u8f85\u52a9\u5206\u7c7b\uff08SAM2\u914d\u5408EfficientNetV2 vs YOLOv13\uff09\uff1b3\uff09\u67e5\u8be2\u5f0f\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08Qwen2.5-VL-7b vs Qwen2.5-VL-32b\uff09\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u6ce8\u89c6\u70b9\u4e0e\u7269\u4f53\u8bed\u4e49\u7684\u5173\u8054\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u5404\u65b9\u6cd5\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u76f4\u63a5\u76ee\u6807\u68c0\u6d4b\uff08YOLOv13\uff09\u548cQwen2.5-VL-32b\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0cMacro F1-Score\u5747\u8d85\u8fc70.84\u3002\u5927\u578bVLM\uff08Qwen2.5-VL-32b\uff09\u5728\u8bc6\u522b\u5c0f\u5c3a\u5bf8\u3001\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u7269\u4f53\uff08\u5982\u4ea4\u901a\u4fe1\u53f7\u706f\uff09\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u66f4\u5f3a\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u5c24\u5176\u5728\u591c\u95f4\u6076\u52a3\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u3002\u5206\u5272\u8f85\u52a9\u65b9\u6cd5\u56e0\"\u90e8\u5206vs\u6574\u4f53\"\u8bed\u4e49\u5dee\u8ddd\u5bfc\u81f4\u53ec\u56de\u7387\u5927\u5e45\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u68c0\u6d4b\u5668\u7684\u5b9e\u65f6\u6548\u7387\u4e0e\u5927\u578bVLM\u63d0\u4f9b\u7684\u66f4\u4e30\u5bcc\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7406\u89e3\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u6743\u8861\u3002\u8fd9\u4e9b\u53d1\u73b0\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u4eba\u7c7b\u611f\u77e5\u667a\u80fd\u9a7e\u9a76\u5458\u76d1\u63a7\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5173\u952e\u89c1\u89e3\u548c\u5b9e\u8df5\u6307\u5bfc\u3002"}}

Quantization reduces memory and inference costs at the risk of performance loss. Strides have been made to mitigate low precision issues mainly by understanding in-distribution (ID) task behaviour, but the attention mechanism may provide insight on quantization attributes by exploring out-of-distribution (OOD) situations. We investigate the behaviour of quantized small-variant popular vision transformers (DeiT, DeiT3, and ViT) on common OOD datasets. ID analyses show the initial instabilities of 4-bit models, particularly of those trained on the larger ImageNet-22k, as the strongest FP32 model, DeiT3, sharply drop 17% from quantization error to be one of the weakest 4-bit models. While ViT shows reasonable quantization robustness for ID calibration, OOD detection reveals more: ViT and DeiT3 pretrained on ImageNet-22k respectively experienced a 15.0% and 19.2% average quantization delta in AUPR-out between full precision to 4-bit while their ImageNet-1k-only counterparts experienced a 9.5% and 12.0% delta. Overall, our results suggest pretraining on large scale datasets may hinder low-bit quantization robustness in OOD detection and that data augmentation may be a more beneficial option.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u91cf\u5316\u89c6\u89c9Transformer\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u53ef\u80fd\u635f\u5bb3\u4f4e\u6bd4\u7279\u91cf\u5316\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u53ef\u80fd\u662f\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u3002", "motivation": "\u89c6\u89c9Transformer\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u5b9e\u73b0\u53ef\u8bbf\u95ee\u548c\u5b9e\u65f6\u4f7f\u7528\u4ecd\u5177\u6311\u6218\u3002\u91cf\u5316\u80fd\u964d\u4f4e\u5185\u5b58\u548c\u63a8\u7406\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u4f46\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u6027\u80fd\u635f\u5931\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u5206\u5e03\u5185\u4efb\u52a1\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u800c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u53ef\u80fd\u901a\u8fc7\u63a2\u7d22\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u60c5\u51b5\u63d0\u4f9b\u91cf\u5316\u7279\u6027\u7684\u6d1e\u5bdf\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u91cf\u5316\u7684\u5c0f\u578b\u6d41\u884c\u89c6\u89c9Transformer\uff08DeiT\u3001DeiT3\u548cViT\uff09\u5728\u5e38\u89c1\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u3002\u5206\u6790\u5305\u62ec\u5206\u5e03\u5185\u6821\u51c6\u548c\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e0d\u540c\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u89c4\u6a21\uff08ImageNet-22k vs ImageNet-1k\uff09\u5bf9\u91cf\u5316\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "result": "\u5206\u5e03\u5185\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a4\u4f4d\u6a21\u578b\u5b58\u5728\u521d\u59cb\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u90a3\u4e9b\u5728\u8f83\u5927ImageNet-22k\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u6700\u5f3a\u7684FP32\u6a21\u578bDeiT3\u56e0\u91cf\u5316\u8bef\u5dee\u6025\u5267\u4e0b\u964d17%\uff0c\u6210\u4e3a\u6700\u5f31\u76844\u4f4d\u6a21\u578b\u4e4b\u4e00\u3002\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u68c0\u6d4b\u63ed\u793a\uff1a\u5728ImageNet-22k\u4e0a\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684ViT\u548cDeiT3\u5206\u522b\u7ecf\u5386\u4e8615.0%\u548c19.2%\u7684\u5e73\u5747AUPR-out\u91cf\u5316\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u800c\u4ec5\u5728ImageNet-1k\u4e0a\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u5bf9\u5e94\u6a21\u578b\u5dee\u5f02\u4e3a9.5%\u548c12.0%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u53ef\u80fd\u635f\u5bb3\u4f4e\u6bd4\u7279\u91cf\u5316\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u53ef\u80fd\u662f\u66f4\u6709\u5229\u7684\u9009\u62e9\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u5728\u8bc4\u4f30\u91cf\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u65f6\u8003\u8651\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002"}}

Meanwhile, existing safety alignment methods predominantly rely on the fine-tuning process, which inadvertently leads to the increased complexity and computational resources required. To address these issues, we introduce LSSF, a novel safety re-alignment framework with \\underline{L}ow-Rank \\underline{S}afety \\underline{S}ubspace \\underline{F}usion. Our proposed method exploits the low-rank characteristics of safety information in LLMs by constructing a low-rank projection matrix to extract the principal components of safety vectors. Notably, this projection matrix represents the low-rank safety subspace of the LLMs, which we have observed to remain stable during fine-tuning process and is isolated from the model's general capabilities. These principal components are used to effectively restore safety alignment when combined with fine-tuned LLMs through linear arithmetic. Additionally, to account for the varying encoding densities of safety information across different layers of LLMs, we propose a novel metric called safety singular value entropy. This metric quantifies the encoding density and allows for the dynamic computation of the safety-critical rank for each safety vector. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed post-hoc alignment method can effectively restore the safety alignment of fine-tuned models with minimal impact on their performance in downstream tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "LSSF\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u4f4e\u79e9\u5b89\u5168\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u878d\u5408\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u63d0\u53d6LLM\u4e2d\u7684\u4f4e\u79e9\u5b89\u5168\u4fe1\u606f\u4e3b\u6210\u5206\uff0c\u5728\u5fae\u8c03\u540e\u6062\u590d\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u5bf9\u9f50\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u5bf9\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709LLM\u5b89\u5168\u673a\u5236\u8106\u5f31\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u6ca1\u6709\u6709\u5bb3\u5185\u5bb9\u7684\u5fae\u8c03\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u4e5f\u53ef\u80fd\u7834\u574f\u5b89\u5168\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u5b89\u5168\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u5fae\u8c03\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u9700\u6c42\u589e\u52a0\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faLSSF\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528LLM\u4e2d\u5b89\u5168\u4fe1\u606f\u7684\u4f4e\u79e9\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u6784\u5efa\u4f4e\u79e9\u6295\u5f71\u77e9\u9635\u63d0\u53d6\u5b89\u5168\u5411\u91cf\u7684\u4e3b\u6210\u5206\u3002\u8be5\u6295\u5f71\u77e9\u9635\u4ee3\u8868LLM\u7684\u4f4e\u79e9\u5b89\u5168\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u5728\u5fae\u8c03\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u4fdd\u6301\u7a33\u5b9a\u4e14\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u7528\u80fd\u529b\u9694\u79bb\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5b89\u5168\u5947\u5f02\u503c\u71b5\u5ea6\u91cf\u4e0d\u540c\u5c42\u5b89\u5168\u4fe1\u606f\u7f16\u7801\u5bc6\u5ea6\uff0c\u52a8\u6001\u8ba1\u7b97\u6bcf\u4e2a\u5b89\u5168\u5411\u91cf\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u5173\u952e\u79e9\u3002", "result": "\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u540e\u5904\u7406\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u6062\u590d\u5fae\u8c03\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u5bf9\u9f50\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5bf9\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u5f71\u54cd\u6700\u5c0f\u3002", "conclusion": "LSSF\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u4f4e\u79e9\u5b89\u5168\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u878d\u5408\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u540e\u5904\u7406\u5b89\u5168\u5bf9\u9f50\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002"}}

Recently, Logit Lens was also shown to be applicable in autoregressive Vision-Language Models (VLMs), where it illustrates the conceptual content of image tokens in the form of heatmaps, e.g., which image tokens are likely to depict the concept of cat in a given image. However, the visual content of image tokens often gets diffused to language tokens, and consequently, the locality of visual information gets mostly destroyed, which renders Logit Lens visualization unusable for explainability. To address this issue, we introduce a complementary loss to next-token prediction (NTP) to prevent the visual tokens from losing the visual representation inherited from corresponding image patches. The proposed Logit Lens Loss (LLL) is designed to make visual token embeddings more semantically aligned with the textual concepts that describe their image regions (e.g., patches containing a cat with the word \"cat\"), without requiring any architectural modification or large-scale training. This way, LLL constrains the mixing of image and text tokens in the self-attention layers in order to prevent image tokens from losing their localized visual information. As our experiments show, LLL not only makes Logit Lens practically relevant by producing meaningful object confidence maps in images, but also improves performance on vision-centric tasks like segmentation without attaching any special heads.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faLogit Lens Loss (LLL)\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u89c6\u89c9\u4fe1\u606f\u6269\u6563\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8865\u5145\u635f\u5931\u51fd\u6570\u4f7f\u56fe\u50cftoken\u4fdd\u6301\u5c40\u90e8\u89c6\u89c9\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u6539\u5584Logit Lens\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u6548\u679c\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u89c6\u89c9\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "Logit Lens\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b(VLMs)\u4e2d\u7528\u4e8e\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u56fe\u50cftoken\u7684\u6982\u5ff5\u5185\u5bb9\uff0c\u4f46\u89c6\u89c9\u4fe1\u606f\u4f1a\u6269\u6563\u5230\u8bed\u8a00token\u4e2d\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5c40\u90e8\u89c6\u89c9\u4fe1\u606f\u88ab\u7834\u574f\uff0c\u4f7f\u5f97Logit Lens\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u5728\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u65b9\u9762\u53d8\u5f97\u4e0d\u53ef\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faLogit Lens Loss (LLL)\u4f5c\u4e3anext-token prediction (NTP)\u7684\u8865\u5145\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u4f7f\u89c6\u89c9token\u5d4c\u5165\u4e0e\u63cf\u8ff0\u5176\u56fe\u50cf\u533a\u57df\u7684\u6587\u672c\u6982\u5ff5\u66f4\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\uff08\u4f8b\u5982\u5305\u542b\u732b\u7684patch\u4e0e\"\u732b\"\u8fd9\u4e2a\u8bcd\u5bf9\u9f50\uff09\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u67b6\u6784\u4fee\u6539\u6216\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u8bad\u7ec3\u3002LLL\u7ea6\u675f\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5c42\u4e2d\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u6587\u672ctoken\u7684\u6df7\u5408\uff0c\u9632\u6b62\u56fe\u50cftoken\u5931\u53bb\u5c40\u90e8\u89c6\u89c9\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "result": "LLL\u4e0d\u4ec5\u901a\u8fc7\u751f\u6210\u6709\u610f\u4e49\u7684\u5bf9\u8c61\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u56fe\u4f7fLogit Lens\u53d8\u5f97\u5b9e\u7528\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u8fd8\u5728\u65e0\u9700\u9644\u52a0\u7279\u6b8a\u5934\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u5206\u5272\u7b49\u89c6\u89c9\u4e2d\u5fc3\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "Logit Lens Loss\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u4fdd\u6301\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u56fe\u50cftoken\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u89c6\u89c9\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u6539\u5584\u53ef\u89c6\u5316\u6548\u679c\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u89c6\u89c9\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e14\u5b9e\u73b0\u7b80\u5355\u65e0\u9700\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u4fee\u6539\u3002"}}

Employing a mixed-methods approach with architecture students at the Singapore Uni-versity of Technology and Design, the research analyzes student percep-tions across three distinct feedback domains: self-reflection, peer critique, and professor-led reviews. The findings reveal that students engage with LLMs not as authoritative instructors, but as collaborative \"cognitive mir-rors\" that scaffold critical thinking. In self-directed learning, LLMs help structure thoughts and overcome the \"blank page\" problem, though they are limited by a lack of contextual nuance. In peer critiques, the technology serves as a neutral mediator, mitigating social anxiety and the \"fear of of-fending\". Furthermore, in high-stakes professor-led juries, students utilize LLMs primarily as post-critique synthesis engines to manage cognitive overload and translate abstract academic discourse into actionable design iterations.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63a2\u8ba8\u4e86\u5c06\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08LLMs\uff09\u6574\u5408\u5230\u5efa\u7b51\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5de5\u4f5c\u5ba4\u53cd\u9988\u673a\u5236\u4e2d\uff0c\u4ece\u751f\u6210\u6027\u751f\u4ea7\u8f6c\u5411\u53cd\u601d\u6027\u6559\u5b66\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u5b66\u751f\u5c06LLMs\u89c6\u4e3a\u534f\u4f5c\u7684\"\u8ba4\u77e5\u955c\u5b50\"\u800c\u975e\u6743\u5a01\u6307\u5bfc\u8005\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u53cd\u9988\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u53d1\u6325\u4e0d\u540c\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u52a8\u673a\u5728\u4e8e\u63a2\u7d22\u5982\u4f55\u5c06\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4ece\u751f\u6210\u5de5\u5177\u8f6c\u53d8\u4e3a\u6559\u5b66\u8f85\u52a9\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5efa\u7b51\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6559\u80b2\u4e2d\uff0c\u5982\u4f55\u5229\u7528LLMs\u589e\u5f3a\u5b66\u751f\u7684\u53cd\u601d\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u6279\u5224\u6027\u601d\u7ef4\uff0c\u6539\u53d8\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u53cd\u9988\u673a\u5236\u3002", "method": "\u91c7\u7528\u6df7\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u5728\u65b0\u52a0\u5761\u79d1\u6280\u8bbe\u8ba1\u5927\u5b66\u7684\u5efa\u7b51\u5b66\u751f\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u5b66\u751f\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u4e0d\u540c\u53cd\u9988\u9886\u57df\u7684\u611f\u77e5\uff1a\u81ea\u6211\u53cd\u601d\u3001\u540c\u4f34\u6279\u8bc4\u548c\u6559\u6388\u4e3b\u5bfc\u7684\u8bc4\u5ba1\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff1a1\uff09\u5728\u81ea\u4e3b\u5b66\u4e60\u65f6\uff0cLLMs\u5e2e\u52a9\u5b66\u751f\u6784\u5efa\u601d\u7ef4\u3001\u514b\u670d\"\u7a7a\u767d\u9875\"\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u60c5\u5883\u7ec6\u5fae\u5dee\u522b\uff1b2\uff09\u5728\u540c\u4f34\u6279\u8bc4\u4e2d\uff0cLLMs\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e2d\u7acb\u8c03\u89e3\u8005\uff0c\u51cf\u8f7b\u793e\u4ea4\u7126\u8651\u548c\"\u5192\u72af\u6050\u60e7\"\uff1b3\uff09\u5728\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u7684\u6559\u6388\u8bc4\u5ba1\u4e2d\uff0c\u5b66\u751f\u4e3b\u8981\u5c06LLMs\u7528\u4f5c\u8bc4\u5ba1\u540e\u7efc\u5408\u5f15\u64ce\uff0c\u7ba1\u7406\u8ba4\u77e5\u8d1f\u8377\u5e76\u5c06\u62bd\u8c61\u5b66\u672f\u8ba8\u8bba\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u53ef\u884c\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u8fed\u4ee3\u3002", "conclusion": "LLMs\u5728\u5efa\u7b51\u8bbe\u8ba1\u6559\u80b2\u4e2d\u53ef\u4ee5\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6709\u6548\u7684\"\u8ba4\u77e5\u955c\u5b50\"\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u5b66\u751f\u7684\u6279\u5224\u6027\u601d\u7ef4\u53d1\u5c55\u3002\u5b83\u4eec\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u53cd\u9988\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u53d1\u6325\u4e0d\u540c\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u8981\u8ba4\u8bc6\u5230\u5176\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u7f3a\u4e4f\u60c5\u5883\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u8fd9\u8868\u660eLLMs\u5728\u53cd\u601d\u6027\u6559\u5b66\u4e2d\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u5e94\u7528\u6f5c\u529b\u3002"}}

Although existing methods can generate full-body talking avatars with simple human motion, extending this task to grounded human-object interaction (GHOI) remains an open challenge, requiring the avatar to perform text-aligned interactions with surrounding objects. This challenge stems from the need for environmental perception and the control-quality dilemma in GHOI generation. To address this, we propose a novel dual-stream framework, InteractAvatar, which decouples perception and planning from video synthesis for grounded human-object interaction. Leveraging detection to enhance environmental perception, we introduce a Perception and Interaction Module (PIM) to generate text-aligned interaction motions. Additionally, an Audio-Interaction Aware Generation Module (AIM) is proposed to synthesize vivid talking avatars performing object interactions. With a specially designed motion-to-video aligner, PIM and AIM share a similar network structure and enable parallel co-generation of motions and plausible videos, effectively mitigating the control-quality dilemma. Finally, we establish a benchmark, GroundedInter, for evaluating GHOI video generation. Extensive experiments and comparisons demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in generating grounded human-object interactions for talking avatars.

However, despite the impressive progress achieved by CNN- and Transformer-based models, their performance often deteriorates when applied across diverse environments due to severe domain discrepancies. Direct joint training on multiple datasets, which intuitively should enhance generalization, instead results in negative transfer, as shared and domain-specific representations become entangled. To address this challenge, we propose the Feature Separation and Cross-Attention Network FSCA-Net, a unified framework that explicitly disentangles feature representations into domain-invariant and domain-specific components. A novel cross-attention fusion module adaptively models interactions between these components, ensuring effective knowledge transfer while preserving dataset-specific discriminability. Furthermore, a mutual information optimization objective is introduced to maximize consistency among domain-invariant features and minimize redundancy among domain-specific ones, promoting complementary shared-private representations.

Current approaches primarily scale Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning in the text space, even when language alone is insufficient for clear and structured reasoning, and largely neglect visual reasoning mechanisms analogous to the human visuospatial sketchpad and visual imagery. To mitigate this deficiency, we introduce Cognitive Supersensing, a novel training paradigm that endows MLLMs with human-like visual imagery capabilities by integrating a Latent Visual Imagery Prediction (LVIP) head that jointly learns sequences of visual cognitive latent embeddings and aligns them with the answer, thereby forming vision-based internal reasoning chains. We further introduce a reinforcement learning stage that optimizes text reasoning paths based on this grounded visual latent. To evaluate the cognitive capabilities of MLLMs, we present CogSense-Bench, a comprehensive visual question answering (VQA) benchmark assessing five cognitive dimensions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MLLMs trained with Cognitive Supersensing significantly outperform state-of-the-art baselines on CogSense-Bench and exhibit superior generalization on out-of-domain mathematics and science VQA benchmarks, suggesting that internal visual imagery is potentially key to bridging the gap between perceptual recognition and cognitive understanding.

Due to the strong coupling of these two artifacts in real imaging processes, existing methods designed for single degradations fail to generalize to such compound scenarios. In this paper, we present the first systematic study on joint removal of moir\u00e9 patterns and flicker-banding in screen-captured images, and propose a unified restoration framework, named CLEAR. To support this task, we construct a large-scale dataset containing both moir\u00e9 patterns and flicker-banding, and introduce an ISP-based flicker simulation pipeline to stabilize model training and expand the degradation distribution. Furthermore, we design a frequency-domain decomposition and re-composition module together with a trajectory alignment loss to enhance the modeling of compound artifacts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method consistently. outperforms existing image restoration approaches across multiple evaluation metrics, validating its effectiveness in complex real-world scenarios.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86CLEAR\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u9996\u6b21\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u5c4f\u5e55\u62cd\u6444\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u6469\u5c14\u7eb9\u548c\u95ea\u70c1\u6761\u7eb9\u7684\u8054\u5408\u53bb\u9664\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6784\u5efa\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u9891\u7387\u57df\u5206\u89e3\u91cd\u6784\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u590d\u6742\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u6062\u590d\u6548\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u79fb\u52a8\u8bbe\u5907\u62cd\u6444\u663e\u793a\u5c4f\u65f6\uff0c\u56fe\u50cf\u5e38\u540c\u65f6\u906d\u53d7\u6469\u5c14\u7eb9\u548c\u95ea\u70c1\u6761\u7eb9\u7684\u4e25\u91cd\u9000\u5316\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e24\u79cd\u4f2a\u5f71\u5728\u771f\u5b9e\u6210\u50cf\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5f3a\u8026\u5408\uff0c\u73b0\u6709\u9488\u5bf9\u5355\u4e00\u9000\u5316\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u6cd5\u5904\u7406\u8fd9\u79cd\u590d\u5408\u573a\u666f\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u89c6\u89c9\u8d28\u91cf\u663e\u8457\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u6062\u590d\u6846\u67b6CLEAR\uff1a1\uff09\u6784\u5efa\u5305\u542b\u6469\u5c14\u7eb9\u548c\u95ea\u70c1\u6761\u7eb9\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff1b2\uff09\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8eISP\u7684\u95ea\u70c1\u6a21\u62df\u6d41\u7a0b\u6765\u7a33\u5b9a\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u5e76\u6269\u5c55\u9000\u5316\u5206\u5e03\uff1b3\uff09\u8bbe\u8ba1\u9891\u7387\u57df\u5206\u89e3\u4e0e\u91cd\u6784\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u8f68\u8ff9\u5bf9\u9f50\u635f\u5931\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u590d\u5408\u4f2a\u5f71\u5efa\u6a21\u3002", "result": "\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u8bc4\u4f30\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u4e00\u81f4\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u56fe\u50cf\u6062\u590d\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u5728\u590d\u6742\u771f\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u9996\u6b21\u7cfb\u7edf\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u5c4f\u5e55\u62cd\u6444\u56fe\u50cf\u4e2d\u6469\u5c14\u7eb9\u548c\u95ea\u70c1\u6761\u7eb9\u7684\u8054\u5408\u53bb\u9664\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7684CLEAR\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u521b\u65b0\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6784\u5efa\u3001\u6a21\u62df\u6d41\u7a0b\u548c\u9891\u7387\u57df\u5904\u7406\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u4e3a\u590d\u6742\u9000\u5316\u573a\u666f\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u6062\u590d\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

This expansion has relied on sustained efforts by large technology corporations to aggregate and curate internet-scale datasets. In this work, we examine the environmental, social, and economic costs of large-scale data in AI through a sustainability lens. We argue that the field is shifting from building models from data to actively creating data for building models. We characterise this transition as hyper-datafication, which marks a critical juncture for the future of frontier AI and its societal impacts. To quantify and contextualise data-related costs, we analyse approximately 550,000 datasets from the Hugging Face Hub, focusing on dataset growth, storage-related energy consumption and carbon footprint, and societal representation using language data. We complement this analysis with qualitative responses from data workers in Kenya to examine the labour involved, including direct employment by big tech corporations and exposure to graphic content. We further draw on external data sources to substantiate our findings by illustrating the global disparity in data centre infrastructure. Our analyses reveal that hyper-datafication does not merely increase resource consumption but systematically redistributes environmental burdens, labour risks, and representational harms toward the Global South, precarious data workers, and under-represented cultures. Thus, we propose Data PROOFS recommendations spanning provenance, resource awareness, ownership, openness, frugality, and standards to mitigate these costs. Our work aims to make visible the often-overlooked costs of data that underpin frontier AI and to stimulate broader debate within the research community and beyond.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u5206\u6790\u4e86AI\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u7684\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u6027\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\"\u8d85\u6570\u636e\u5316\"\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u6307\u51fa\u6570\u636e\u76f8\u5173\u6210\u672c\u5411\u5168\u7403\u5357\u65b9\u3001\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6570\u636e\u5de5\u4f5c\u8005\u548c\u5f31\u52bf\u6587\u5316\u8f6c\u79fb\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51faData PROOFS\u5efa\u8bae\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u52a8\u673a\u662f\u63ed\u793a\u652f\u6491\u524d\u6cbfAI\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u7684\u73af\u5883\u3001\u793e\u4f1a\u548c\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5b66\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6210\u672c\u5f80\u5f80\u88ab\u5ffd\u89c6\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u8ba4\u4e3aAI\u9886\u57df\u6b63\u4ece\"\u7528\u6570\u636e\u6784\u5efa\u6a21\u578b\"\u8f6c\u5411\"\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u6a21\u578b\u4e3b\u52a8\u521b\u9020\u6570\u636e\"\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\"\u8d85\u6570\u636e\u5316\"\u8f6c\u53d8\u5bf9AI\u672a\u6765\u548c\u793e\u4f1a\u5f71\u54cd\u5177\u6709\u5173\u952e\u610f\u4e49\u3002", "method": "\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u6cd5\u5305\u62ec\uff1a1\uff09\u5b9a\u91cf\u5206\u6790Hugging Face Hub\u4e0a\u7ea655\u4e07\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5173\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u589e\u957f\u3001\u5b58\u50a8\u76f8\u5173\u80fd\u8017\u548c\u78b3\u8db3\u8ff9\u3001\u8bed\u8a00\u6570\u636e\u7684\u793e\u4f1a\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\uff1b2\uff09\u5b9a\u6027\u5206\u6790\u80af\u5c3c\u4e9a\u6570\u636e\u5de5\u4f5c\u8005\u7684\u56de\u5e94\uff0c\u8003\u5bdf\u52b3\u52a8\u53c2\u4e0e\u60c5\u51b5\uff1b3\uff09\u7ed3\u5408\u5916\u90e8\u6570\u636e\u6e90\u5206\u6790\u5168\u7403\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5fc3\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u7684\u4e0d\u5e73\u7b49\u5206\u5e03\u3002", "result": "\u5206\u6790\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff1a1\uff09\u8d85\u6570\u636e\u5316\u4e0d\u4ec5\u589e\u52a0\u8d44\u6e90\u6d88\u8017\uff0c\u8fd8\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5c06\u73af\u5883\u8d1f\u62c5\u3001\u52b3\u52a8\u98ce\u9669\u548c\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u635f\u5bb3\u91cd\u65b0\u5206\u914d\u7ed9\u5168\u7403\u5357\u65b9\u3001\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u6570\u636e\u5de5\u4f5c\u8005\u548c\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u7684\u6587\u5316\uff1b2\uff09\u5b58\u5728\u5168\u7403\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5fc3\u57fa\u7840\u8bbe\u65bd\u7684\u663e\u8457\u4e0d\u5e73\u7b49\uff1b3\uff09\u6570\u636e\u5de5\u4f5c\u8005\u9762\u4e34\u5927\u79d1\u6280\u516c\u53f8\u76f4\u63a5\u96c7\u4f63\u548c\u63a5\u89e6\u4e0d\u826f\u5185\u5bb9\u7684\u53cc\u91cd\u98ce\u9669\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ed3\u8bba\u662f\u8d85\u6570\u636e\u5316\u5e26\u6765\u4e86\u4e0d\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u7684\u6210\u672c\u5206\u914d\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002\u4e3a\u6b64\u63d0\u51faData PROOFS\u5efa\u8bae\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u6765\u6e90\u8ffd\u6eaf\u3001\u8d44\u6e90\u610f\u8bc6\u3001\u6240\u6709\u6743\u3001\u5f00\u653e\u6027\u3001\u8282\u4fed\u6027\u548c\u6807\u51c6\u5236\u5b9a\u7b49\u65b9\u9762\uff0c\u65e8\u5728\u51cf\u8f7b\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6210\u672c\uff0c\u5e76\u6fc0\u53d1\u7814\u7a76\u793e\u533a\u548c\u66f4\u5e7f\u6cdb\u793e\u4f1a\u5bf9\u8fd9\u4e9b\u88ab\u5ffd\u89c6\u7684\u6570\u636e\u6210\u672c\u7684\u8ba8\u8bba\u3002"}}

We introduce Multimodal UNcommonsense(MUN), a benchmark designed to evaluate models' ability to handle scenarios that deviate from typical visual or contextual expectations. MUN pairs visual scenes with surprising or unlikely outcomes described in natural language, prompting models to either rationalize seemingly odd images using everyday logic or uncover unexpected interpretations in ordinary scenes. To support this task, we propose a retrieval-based in-context learning (R-ICL) framework that transfers reasoning capabilities from larger models to smaller ones without additional training. Leveraging a novel Multimodal Ensemble Retriever (MER), our method identifies semantically relevant exemplars even when image and text pairs are deliberately discordant. Experiments show an average improvement of 8.3% over baseline ICL methods, highlighting the effectiveness of R-ICL in low-frequency, atypical settings.

However, this task poses significant challenges due to self-occlusion of the hands and occlusions caused by interactions with objects. In this paper, we propose HandMCM to address these challenges. Our HandMCM is a novel method based on the powerful state space model (Mamba). By incorporating modules for local information injection/filtering and correspondence modeling, the proposed correspondence Mamba effectively learns the highly dynamic kinematic topology of keypoints across various occlusion scenarios.

However, existing RL based approaches for flow matching models typically rely on numerous denoising steps, while suffering from sparse and imprecise reward signals that often lead to suboptimal alignment. To address these limitations, we propose Temperature Annealed Few step Sampling with Group Relative Policy Optimization (TAFS GRPO), a novel framework for training flow matching text to image models into efficient few step generators well aligned with human preferences. Our method iteratively injects adaptive temporal noise onto the results of one step samples. By repeatedly annealing the model's sampled outputs, it introduces stochasticity into the sampling process while preserving the semantic integrity of each generated image. Moreover, its step aware advantage integration mechanism combines the GRPO to avoid the need for the differentiable of reward function and provide dense and step specific rewards for stable policy optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that TAFS GRPO achieves strong performance in few step text to image generation and significantly improves the alignment of generated images with human preferences.

Recently, the emerging state-space model, namely Mamba, has shown great potential in balancing global receptive fields and computational efficiency. As a solution, we propose Saliency Mamba (Samba), a pure Mamba-based architecture that flexibly handles various distinct SOD tasks, including RGB/RGB-D/RGB-T SOD, video SOD (VSOD), RGB-D VSOD, and visible-depth-thermal SOD. Specifically, we rethink the scanning strategy of Mamba for SOD, and introduce a saliency-guided Mamba block (SGMB) that features a spatial neighborhood scanning (SNS) algorithm to preserve the spatial continuity of salient regions. A context-aware upsampling (CAU) method is also proposed to promote hierarchical feature alignment and aggregation by modeling contextual dependencies. As one step further, to avoid the \"task-specific\" problem as in previous SOD solutions, we develop Samba+, which is empowered by training Samba in a multi-task joint manner, leading to a more unified and versatile model. Two crucial components that collaboratively tackle challenges encountered in input of arbitrary modalities and continual adaptation are investigated. Specifically, a hub-and-spoke graph attention (HGA) module facilitates adaptive cross-modal interactive fusion, and a modality-anchored continual learning (MACL) strategy alleviates inter-modal conflicts together with catastrophic forgetting. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Samba individually outperforms existing methods across six SOD tasks on 22 datasets with lower computational cost, whereas Samba+ achieves even superior results on these tasks and datasets by using a single trained versatile model.

Here, we propose a Unified and Versatile Multimodal Multi-Task Learning (UV-M3TL) framework to simultaneously recognize driver behavior, driver emotion, vehicle behavior, and traffic context, while mitigating inter-task negative transfer. Our framework incorporates two core components: dual-branch spatial channel multimodal embedding (DB-SCME) and adaptive feature-decoupled multi-task loss (AFD-Loss). DB-SCME enhances cross-task knowledge transfer while mitigating task conflicts by employing a dual-branch structure to explicitly model salient task-shared and task-specific features. AFD-Loss improves the stability of joint optimization while guiding the model to learn diverse multi-task representations by introducing an adaptive weighting mechanism based on learning dynamics and feature decoupling constraints. We evaluate our method on the AIDE dataset, and the experimental results demonstrate that UV-M3TL achieves state-of-the-art performance across all four tasks. To further prove the versatility, we evaluate UV-M3TL on additional public multi-task perception benchmarks (BDD100K, CityScapes, NYUD-v2, and PASCAL-Context), where it consistently delivers strong performance across diverse task combinations, attaining state-of-the-art results on most tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faUV-M3TL\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u5206\u652f\u7a7a\u95f4\u901a\u9053\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5d4c\u5165\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7279\u5f81\u89e3\u8026\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u8bc6\u522b\u9a7e\u9a76\u5458\u884c\u4e3a\u3001\u60c5\u7eea\u3001\u8f66\u8f86\u884c\u4e3a\u548c\u4ea4\u901a\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u7f13\u89e3\u4efb\u52a1\u95f4\u8d1f\u8fc1\u79fb\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97SOTA\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u9ad8\u7ea7\u9a7e\u9a76\u8f85\u52a9\u7cfb\u7edf\u9700\u8981\u540c\u65f6\u7406\u89e3\u9a7e\u9a76\u5458\u884c\u4e3a\u548c\u611f\u77e5\u5bfc\u822a\u73af\u5883\uff0c\u4f46\u8054\u5408\u5b66\u4e60\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5f02\u6784\u4efb\u52a1\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u4efb\u52a1\u95f4\u8d1f\u8fc1\u79fb\uff0c\u635f\u5bb3\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\u51b2\u7a81\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7edf\u4e00\u4e14\u901a\u7528\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6UV-M3TL\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff1a1) \u53cc\u5206\u652f\u7a7a\u95f4\u901a\u9053\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5d4c\u5165(DB-SCME)\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u53cc\u5206\u652f\u7ed3\u6784\u663e\u5f0f\u5efa\u6a21\u4efb\u52a1\u5171\u4eab\u548c\u4efb\u52a1\u7279\u5b9a\u7279\u5f81\uff1b2) \u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7279\u5f81\u89e3\u8026\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u635f\u5931(AFD-Loss)\uff0c\u57fa\u4e8e\u5b66\u4e60\u52a8\u6001\u548c\u7279\u5f81\u89e3\u8026\u7ea6\u675f\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u52a0\u6743\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u5728AIDE\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0cUV-M3TL\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u5747\u8fbe\u5230\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u5728BDD100K\u3001CityScapes\u3001NYUD-v2\u548cPASCAL-Context\u7b49\u516c\u5f00\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u611f\u77e5\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u8be5\u6846\u67b6\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u4efb\u52a1\u7ec4\u5408\u4e2d\u5747\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u5728\u5927\u591a\u6570\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97SOTA\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "UV-M3TL\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u8d1f\u8fc1\u79fb\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9a7e\u9a76\u5458\u884c\u4e3a\u548c\u4ea4\u901a\u73af\u5883\u7684\u8054\u5408\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u5f88\u597d\u7684\u901a\u7528\u6027\u548c\u6269\u5c55\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u7ea7\u9a7e\u9a76\u8f85\u52a9\u7cfb\u7edf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u5b66\u4e60\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

However, evaluating such tri-modal outputs remains an unsolved challenge. Human evaluation is reliable but costly and difficult to scale, while traditional automatic metrics, such as FVD, CLAP, and ViCLIP, focus on isolated modality pairs, struggle with complex prompts, and provide limited interpretability. Omni-modal large language models (omni-LLMs) present a promising alternative: they naturally process audio, video, and text, support rich reasoning, and offer interpretable chain-of-thought feedback. Driven by this, we introduce Omni-Judge, a study assessing whether omni-LLMs can serve as human-aligned judges for text-conditioned audio-video generation. Across nine perceptual and alignment metrics, Omni-Judge achieves correlation comparable to traditional metrics and excels on semantically demanding tasks such as audio-text alignment, video-text alignment, and audio-video-text coherence. It underperforms on high-FPS perceptual metrics, including video quality and audio-video synchronization, due to limited temporal resolution. Omni-Judge provides interpretable explanations that expose semantic or physical inconsistencies, enabling practical downstream uses such as feedback-based refinement. Our findings highlight both the potential and current limitations of omni-LLMs as unified evaluators for multi-modal generation.", "AI": {"tldr": "Omni-Judge\u7814\u7a76\u8bc4\u4f30\u5168\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u5426\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6587\u672c\u6761\u4ef6\u97f3\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u7684\u4eba\u7c7b\u5bf9\u9f50\u8bc4\u4f30\u5668\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u5176\u5728\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u9ad8\u5e27\u7387\u611f\u77e5\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u6587\u672c\u5230\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\uff08\u5982Sora 2\u548cVeo 3\uff09\u80fd\u4ea7\u751f\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u97f3\u89c6\u9891\uff0c\u4f46\u8bc4\u4f30\u8fd9\u79cd\u4e09\u6a21\u6001\u8f93\u51fa\u4ecd\u5177\u6311\u6218\u6027\u3002\u4eba\u5de5\u8bc4\u4f30\u53ef\u9760\u4f46\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u81ea\u52a8\u6307\u6807\u5c40\u9650\u4e8e\u5355\u6a21\u6001\u5bf9\u4e14\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u5dee\u3002\u5168\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u81ea\u7136\u5904\u7406\u97f3\u89c6\u9891\u6587\u672c\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u4e30\u5bcc\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u6709\u671b\u6210\u4e3a\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165Omni-Judge\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u5168\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6587\u672c\u6761\u4ef6\u97f3\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u7684\u4eba\u7c7b\u5bf9\u9f50\u8bc4\u4f30\u5668\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8986\u76d6\u4e5d\u4e2a\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u5bf9\u9f50\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u6307\u6807\u8fdb\u884c\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u6bd4\u8f83\u3002", "result": "Omni-Judge\u5728\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u4e0a\u4e0e\u4f20\u7edf\u6307\u6807\u76f8\u5f53\uff0c\u5728\u8bed\u4e49\u8981\u6c42\u9ad8\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u97f3\u9891-\u6587\u672c\u5bf9\u9f50\u3001\u89c6\u9891-\u6587\u672c\u5bf9\u9f50\u3001\u97f3\u9891-\u89c6\u9891-\u6587\u672c\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff09\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u3002\u4f46\u5728\u9ad8\u5e27\u7387\u611f\u77e5\u6307\u6807\uff08\u89c6\u9891\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u97f3\u9891-\u89c6\u9891\u540c\u6b65\uff09\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4e0d\u4f73\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u65f6\u95f4\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u3002\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u53cd\u9988\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u8bed\u4e49\u6216\u7269\u7406\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5168\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4f5c\u4e3a\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u751f\u6210\u7684\u7edf\u4e00\u8bc4\u4f30\u5668\u5177\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\uff0c\u4f46\u5f53\u524d\u5728\u65f6\u95f4\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u9ad8\u5e27\u7387\u611f\u77e5\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u3002\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u6027\u53cd\u9988\u652f\u6301\u4e0b\u6e38\u5e94\u7528\u5982\u57fa\u4e8e\u53cd\u9988\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u3002"}}

This system, accessible after user-training, enables continuous monitoring and evaluation of LLM use.\n  In 1.5 years, we built 7 automations and 1075 users have trained to become routine users of the UI, engaging in 23,000 sessions in the first 3 months of launch. For automations, being model-agnostic and accessing multiple types of data was essential for matching specific clinical or administrative tasks with the most appropriate LLM. Benchmark-based evaluations proved insufficient for monitoring and evaluation of the UI, requiring new methods to monitor performance. Generation of summaries was the most frequent task in the UI, with an estimated 0.73 hallucinations and 1.60 inaccuracies per generation. The resulting mix of cost savings, time savings, and revenue growth required a value assessment framework to prioritize work as well as quantify the impact of using LLMs. Initial estimates are $6M savings in the first year of use, without quantifying the benefit of the better care offered. Such a \"build-from-within\" strategy provides an opportunity for health systems to maintain agency via a vendor-agnostic, internally governed LLM platform.", "AI": {"tldr": "ChatEHR\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u96c6\u6210LLM\u5230\u7535\u5b50\u5065\u5eb7\u8bb0\u5f55\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u4efb\u52a1\u548c\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u4f7f\u7528\uff0c\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u6587\u6863\u5904\u7406\u4e2d\u51cf\u5c11\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u6469\u64e6\uff0c\u5df2\u5b9e\u73b0\u663e\u8457\u7684\u6210\u672c\u8282\u7ea6\u548c\u7528\u6237\u91c7\u7528\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e34\u5e8a\u6587\u6863\u5904\u7406\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u7684\"\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u6469\u64e6\"\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5373\u624b\u52a8\u6570\u636e\u5f55\u5165\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5c06LLM\u4e0e\u5b8c\u6574\u7684\u60a3\u8005\u65f6\u95f4\u7ebf\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u7535\u5b50\u5065\u5eb7\u8bb0\u5f55\u7cfb\u7edf\u4e2d\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1ChatEHR\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u8be5\u7cfb\u7edf\u652f\u6301\u4e24\u79cd\u4f7f\u7528\u6a21\u5f0f\uff1a1) \u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u9759\u6001\u63d0\u793a\u4e0e\u6570\u636e\u7ec4\u5408\u6267\u884c\u56fa\u5b9a\u4efb\u52a1\uff09\uff1b2) \u901a\u8fc7\u7528\u6237\u754c\u9762\u5728EHR\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u4f7f\u7528\u3002\u7cfb\u7edf\u91c7\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u65e0\u5173\u8bbe\u8ba1\uff0c\u53ef\u8bbf\u95ee\u591a\u79cd\u6570\u636e\u7c7b\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u76d1\u63a7\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "result": "\u57281.5\u5e74\u5185\u6784\u5efa\u4e867\u4e2a\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c1075\u540d\u7528\u6237\u7ecf\u8fc7\u57f9\u8bad\u6210\u4e3a\u5e38\u89c4\u7528\u6237\uff0c\u524d3\u4e2a\u6708\u8fdb\u884c\u4e8623,000\u6b21\u4f1a\u8bdd\u3002\u603b\u7ed3\u751f\u6210\u662f\u6700\u9891\u7e41\u7684\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u6bcf\u751f\u6210\u7ea60.73\u4e2a\u5e7b\u89c9\u548c1.60\u4e2a\u4e0d\u51c6\u786e\u4fe1\u606f\u3002\u521d\u6b65\u4f30\u8ba1\u7b2c\u4e00\u5e74\u53ef\u8282\u7701600\u4e07\u7f8e\u5143\uff0c\u672a\u8ba1\u5165\u63d0\u4f9b\u66f4\u597d\u62a4\u7406\u7684\u6548\u76ca\u3002", "conclusion": "ChatEHR\u5c06LLM\u4f7f\u7528\u91cd\u65b0\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e3a\u673a\u6784\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\"\u5185\u90e8\u6784\u5efa\"\u7b56\u7565\u4f7f\u536b\u751f\u7cfb\u7edf\u80fd\u591f\u4fdd\u6301\u81ea\u4e3b\u6027\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4f9b\u5e94\u5546\u65e0\u5173\u3001\u5185\u90e8\u6cbb\u7406\u7684LLM\u5e73\u53f0\u3002\u9700\u8981\u65b0\u7684\u76d1\u63a7\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u548c\u4ef7\u503c\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u91cf\u5316LLM\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002"}}

Reward-based post-training has emerged as a promising direction to improve the quality and semantic alignment of generated videos. However, recent methods either rely on large-scale human preference annotations or operate on misaligned embeddings from pre-trained vision-language models, leading to limited scalability or suboptimal supervision. We present $\\texttt{PISCES}$, an annotation-free post-training algorithm that addresses these limitations via a novel Dual Optimal Transport (OT)-aligned Rewards module. To align reward signals with human judgment, $\\texttt{PISCES}$ uses OT to bridge text and video embeddings at both distributional and discrete token levels, enabling reward supervision to fulfill two objectives: (i) a Distributional OT-aligned Quality Reward that captures overall visual quality and temporal coherence; and (ii) a Discrete Token-level OT-aligned Semantic Reward that enforces semantic, spatio-temporal correspondence between text and video tokens. To our knowledge, $\\texttt{PISCES}$ is the first to improve annotation-free reward supervision in generative post-training through the lens of OT. Experiments on both short- and long-video generation show that $\\texttt{PISCES}$ outperforms both annotation-based and annotation-free methods on VBench across Quality and Semantic scores, with human preference studies further validating its effectiveness. We show that the Dual OT-aligned Rewards module is compatible with multiple optimization paradigms, including direct backpropagation and reinforcement learning fine-tuning.", "AI": {"tldr": "PISCES\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u53cc\u91cd\u6700\u4f18\u4f20\u8f93\u5bf9\u9f50\u5956\u52b1\u7684\u65e0\u6807\u6ce8\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u6539\u8fdb\u6587\u672c\u5230\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4eba\u5de5\u504f\u597d\u6807\u6ce8\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u5956\u52b1\u7684\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6cd5\u8981\u4e48\u4f9d\u8d56\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u4eba\u5de5\u504f\u597d\u6807\u6ce8\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u4f7f\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u672a\u5bf9\u9f50\u5d4c\u5165\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u6709\u9650\u6216\u76d1\u7763\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u6807\u6ce8\u4f46\u80fd\u63d0\u4f9b\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u5956\u52b1\u4fe1\u53f7\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u6539\u8fdb\u6587\u672c\u5230\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faPISCES\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u53cc\u91cd\u6700\u4f18\u4f20\u8f93\u5bf9\u9f50\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u5757\uff1a1) \u5206\u5e03\u7ea7OT\u5bf9\u9f50\u8d28\u91cf\u5956\u52b1\uff0c\u6355\u6349\u6574\u4f53\u89c6\u89c9\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff1b2) \u79bb\u6563\u4ee4\u724c\u7ea7OT\u5bf9\u9f50\u8bed\u4e49\u5956\u52b1\uff0c\u5f3a\u5236\u6587\u672c\u548c\u89c6\u9891\u4ee4\u724c\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u65f6\u7a7a\u5bf9\u5e94\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u517c\u5bb9\u591a\u79cd\u4f18\u5316\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u76f4\u63a5\u53cd\u5411\u4f20\u64ad\u548c\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u5fae\u8c03\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u77ed\u89c6\u9891\u548c\u957f\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\uff0cPISCES\u5728VBench\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u6570\u4e0a\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u57fa\u4e8e\u6807\u6ce8\u548c\u65e0\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u4eba\u7c7b\u504f\u597d\u7814\u7a76\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u9a8c\u8bc1\u4e86\u5176\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002\u53cc\u91cdOT\u5bf9\u9f50\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u5757\u4e0e\u591a\u79cd\u4f18\u5316\u8303\u5f0f\u517c\u5bb9\u3002", "conclusion": "PISCES\u9996\u6b21\u901a\u8fc7\u6700\u4f18\u4f20\u8f93\u89c6\u89d2\u6539\u8fdb\u751f\u6210\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u7684\u65e0\u6807\u6ce8\u5956\u52b1\u76d1\u7763\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u4f46\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u6587\u672c\u5230\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u76d1\u7763\u6548\u679c\u3002"}}

While these task-specific integrations yield performance gains, they often lack the systematic coherence required for holistic world understanding. In this paper, we analyze the limitations of such fragmented approaches and propose a unified design specification for world models. We suggest that a robust world model should not be a loose collection of capabilities but a normative framework that integrally incorporates interaction, perception, symbolic reasoning, and spatial representation. This work aims to provide a structured perspective to guide future research toward more general, robust, and principled models of the world.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u7814\u7a76\u7684\u788e\u7247\u5316\u73b0\u72b6\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u8bbe\u8ba1\u89c4\u8303\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u5e94\u6574\u5408\u4ea4\u4e92\u3001\u611f\u77e5\u3001\u7b26\u53f7\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u6307\u5bfc\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u7814\u7a76\u5448\u73b0\u788e\u7247\u5316\u72b6\u6001\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u96c6\u4e2d\u5728\u5c06\u4e16\u754c\u77e5\u8bc6\u6ce8\u5165\u5230\u89c6\u89c9\u9884\u6d4b\u30013D\u4f30\u8ba1\u6216\u7b26\u53f7\u57fa\u7840\u7b49\u5b64\u7acb\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u5b9a\u4e49\u548c\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u7684\u4e16\u754c\u7406\u89e3\u3002", "method": "\u5206\u6790\u73b0\u6709\u788e\u7247\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u89c4\u8303\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u5e94\u4f5c\u4e3a\u89c4\u8303\u6027\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u6574\u5408\u4ea4\u4e92\u3001\u611f\u77e5\u3001\u7b26\u53f7\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u8868\u793a\u7b49\u6838\u5fc3\u8981\u7d20\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7684\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u89c4\u8303\uff0c\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u6307\u5bfc\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u66f4\u901a\u7528\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u548c\u539f\u5219\u5316\u7684\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u53d1\u5c55\u3002", "conclusion": "\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u4e0d\u5e94\u662f\u677e\u6563\u7684\u80fd\u529b\u96c6\u5408\uff0c\u800c\u5e94\u662f\u6574\u5408\u4e86\u4ea4\u4e92\u3001\u611f\u77e5\u3001\u7b26\u53f7\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u8868\u793a\u7684\u89c4\u8303\u6027\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e3aAI\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u7cfb\u7edf\u5316\u7684\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

Recent works scale RAG at inference time along two complementary dimensions: sequential depth for iterative refinement and parallel width for coverage expansion. However, naive scaling causes context contamination and scaling inefficiency, leading to diminishing or negative returns despite increased computation. To address these limitations, we propose SPARC-RAG, a multi-agent framework that coordinates sequential and parallel inference-time scaling under a unified context management mechanism. SPARC-RAG employs specialized agents that maintain a shared global context and provide explicit control over the scaling process. It generates targeted, complementary sub-queries for each branch to enable diverse parallel exploration, and explicitly regulates exiting decisions based on answer correctness and evidence grounding. To optimize scaling behavior, we further introduce a lightweight fine-tuning method with process-level verifiable preferences, which improves the efficiency of sequential scaling and effectiveness of parallel scaling.

Federated learning (FL) addresses this challenge by enabling global model aggregation without data exchange.

This study proposes a FL framework leveraging a dynamic adaptive focal loss (DAFL) and a client-aware aggregation strategy for local training. Specifically, we design a dynamic class imbalance coefficient that adjusts based on each client's sample distribution and class data distribution, ensuring minority classes receive sufficient attention and preventing sparse data from being ignored. To address client heterogeneity, a weighted aggregation strategy is adopted, which adapts to data size and characteristics to better capture inter-client variations. The classification results on three public datasets (ISIC, Ocular Disease and RSNA-ICH) show that the proposed framework outperforms DenseNet121, ResNet50, ViT-S/16, ViT-L/32, FedCLIP, Swin Transformer, CoAtNet, and MixNet in most cases, with accuracy improvements ranging from 0.98\\% to 41.69\\%.

Early dual-tower Vision-Language Models (VLMs) struggle with cross-modality compositional reasoning required for this task. Recently, adapting generative Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for retrieval offers a promising direction. However, we identify that this adaptation strategy overlooks a fundamental issue: adapting a generative MLLM into a single-embedding discriminative retriever triggers a paradigm conflict, which leads to Capability Degradation - the deterioration of native fine-grained reasoning after retrieval adaptation. To address this challenge, we propose ReCALL (Recalibrating Capability Degradation), a model-agnostic framework that follows a diagnose-generate-refine pipeline: Firstly, we diagnose cognitive blind spots of the retriever via self-guided informative instance mining. Next, we generate corrective instructions and triplets by CoT prompting the foundation MLLM and conduct quality control with VQA-based consistency filtering. Finally, we refine the retriever through continual training on these triplets with a grouped contrastive scheme, thereby internalizing fine-grained visual-semantic distinctions and realigning the discriminative embedding space of retriever with intrinsic compositional reasoning within the MLLM.

Existing models achieve strong per-frame accuracy but often flicker under motion, occlusion, and lighting changes, and they rarely have paired human video supervision for multiple dense tasks. We address this gap with a scalable synthetic data pipeline that generates photorealistic human frames and motion-aligned sequences with pixel-accurate depth, normals, and masks. Unlike prior static data synthetic pipelines, our pipeline provides both frame-level labels for spatial learning and sequence-level supervision for temporal learning. Building on this, we train a unified ViT-based dense predictor that (i) injects an explicit human geometric prior via CSE embeddings and (ii) improves geometry-feature reliability with a lightweight channel reweighting module after feature fusion. Our two-stage training strategy, combining static pretraining with dynamic sequence supervision, enables the model first to acquire robust spatial representations and then refine temporal consistency across motion-aligned sequences.

In this paper, we empirically evaluate NetVLAD as an LCD module and compare it against DBoW on the KITTI dataset. We introduce a Fine-Grained Top-K precision-recall curve that better reflects LCD settings where a query may have zero or multiple valid matches.

However, accurately interpreting unconstrained STEM student handwritten solutions with intertwined mathematical formulas, diagrams, and textual reasoning poses a significant challenge due to the lack of authentic and domain-specific benchmarks. Additionally, current evaluation paradigms predominantly rely on the outcomes of downstream tasks (e.g., auto-grading), which often probe only a subset of the recognized content, thereby failing to capture the MLLMs' understanding of complex handwritten logic as a whole. To bridge this gap, we release EDU-CIRCUIT-HW, a dataset consisting of 1,300+ authentic student handwritten solutions from a university-level STEM course. Utilizing the expert-verified verbatim transcriptions and grading reports of student solutions, we simultaneously evaluate various MLLMs' upstream recognition fidelity and downstream auto-grading performance. Our evaluation uncovers an astonishing scale of latent failures within MLLM-recognized student handwritten content, highlighting the models' insufficient reliability for auto-grading and other understanding-oriented applications in high-stakes educational settings. In solution, we present a case study demonstrating that leveraging identified error patterns to preemptively detect and rectify recognition errors, with only minimal human intervention (approximately 4% of the total solutions), can significantly enhance the robustness of the deployed AI-enabled grading system on unseen student solutions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u53d1\u5e03\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u540d\u4e3aEDU-CIRCUIT-HW\u7684\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5305\u542b1300+\u4efd\u5927\u5b66STEM\u8bfe\u7a0b\u7684\u5b66\u751f\u624b\u5199\u89e3\u7b54\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u624b\u5199\u5185\u5bb9\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u81ea\u52a8\u8bc4\u5206\u4e2d\u7684\u8868\u73b0\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6a21\u578b\u5b58\u5728\u5927\u91cf\u6f5c\u5728\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u901a\u8fc7\u9519\u8bef\u6a21\u5f0f\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u4eba\u5de5\u5e72\u9884\u63d0\u5347\u7cfb\u7edf\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6559\u80b2\u9886\u57df\u6709\u5de8\u5927\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u771f\u5b9e\u3001\u9886\u57df\u7279\u5b9a\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u5b66\u751f\u624b\u5199\u89e3\u7b54\uff08\u5305\u542b\u6570\u5b66\u516c\u5f0f\u3001\u56fe\u8868\u548c\u6587\u672c\u63a8\u7406\uff09\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u5982\u81ea\u52a8\u8bc4\u5206\uff09\uff0c\u53ea\u80fd\u63a2\u6d4b\u90e8\u5206\u8bc6\u522b\u5185\u5bb9\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u5168\u9762\u8bc4\u4f30\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u590d\u6742\u624b\u5199\u903b\u8f91\u7684\u6574\u4f53\u7406\u89e3\u3002", "method": "1. \u53d1\u5e03EDU-CIRCUIT-HW\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5305\u542b1300+\u4efd\u5927\u5b66STEM\u8bfe\u7a0b\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u5b66\u751f\u624b\u5199\u89e3\u7b54\uff1b2. \u5229\u7528\u4e13\u5bb6\u9a8c\u8bc1\u7684\u9010\u5b57\u8f6c\u5f55\u548c\u8bc4\u5206\u62a5\u544a\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u8bc4\u4f30\u5404\u79cdMLLM\u7684\u4e0a\u6e38\u8bc6\u522b\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u548c\u4e0b\u6e38\u81ea\u52a8\u8bc4\u5206\u6027\u80fd\uff1b3. \u901a\u8fc7\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u5c55\u793a\u5982\u4f55\u5229\u7528\u8bc6\u522b\u51fa\u7684\u9519\u8bef\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c11\u91cf\u4eba\u5de5\u5e72\u9884\uff08\u7ea64%\u7684\u89e3\u7b54\uff09\u6765\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u7ea0\u6b63\u8bc6\u522b\u9519\u8bef\uff0c\u63d0\u5347AI\u8bc4\u5206\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u672a\u89c1\u5b66\u751f\u89e3\u7b54\u4e0a\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u8bc4\u4f30\u63ed\u793a\u4e86MLLM\u5728\u5b66\u751f\u624b\u5199\u5185\u5bb9\u8bc6\u522b\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u60ca\u4eba\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u9519\u8bef\u89c4\u6a21\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u6559\u80b2\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u7528\u4e8e\u81ea\u52a8\u8bc4\u5206\u548c\u5176\u4ed6\u7406\u89e3\u5bfc\u5411\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002\u6848\u4f8b\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bc6\u522b\u9519\u8bef\u6a21\u5f0f\u8fdb\u884c\u9884\u9632\u6027\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u7ea0\u6b63\uff0c\u53ea\u9700\u5c11\u91cf\u4eba\u5de5\u5e72\u9884\u5373\u53ef\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347AI\u8bc4\u5206\u7cfb\u7edf\u5728\u672a\u89c1\u5b66\u751f\u89e3\u7b54\u4e0a\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u89e3\u91ca\u5b66\u751f\u624b\u5199STEM\u89e3\u7b54\u65b9\u9762\u4ecd\u5b58\u5728\u663e\u8457\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u9ad8\u98ce\u9669\u6559\u80b2\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5730\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u7ea0\u6b63\u8bc6\u522b\u9519\u8bef\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5c11\u91cf\u4eba\u5de5\u5e72\u9884\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347AI\u8bc4\u5206\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u4e3a\u6559\u80b2\u9886\u57df\u7684\u53ef\u9760AI\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

The system adopts a parallel pipeline with a VR Frontend and a GA Backend. The VR Frontend uses inverse kinematics to estimate full-body pose and streams the resulting pose along with stereo camera parameters to the backend. The GA Backend stereoscopically renders a 3DGS avatar reconstructed from a single image. To improve stereo rendering efficiency, we introduce Binocular Batching, which jointly processes left and right eye views in a single batched pass to reduce redundant computation and support high-resolution VR displays. We evaluate VRGaussianAvatar with quantitative performance tests and a within-subject user study against image- and video-based mesh avatar baselines. Results show that VRGaussianAvatar sustains interactive VR performance and yields higher perceived appearance similarity, embodiment, and plausibility.

While simulation platforms provide a promising alternative, existing approaches often suffer from a substantial visual and physical gap to real environments and rely on expensive sensors, precise robot calibration, or depth measurements, limiting their practicality at scale. We present Simulate Anything, a graphics-driven world modeling and simulation framework that enables efficient generation of high-fidelity embodied training data using only multi-view environment videos and off-the-shelf assets. Our approach reconstructs real-world environments into a photorealistic scene representation using 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), seamlessly capturing fine-grained geometry and appearance from video. We then leverage generative models to recover a physically realistic representation and integrate it into a simulation environment via a precision calibration target, enabling accurate scale alignment between the reconstructed scene and the real world. Together, these components provide a unified, editable, and physically grounded world model.

Based on the Material Point Method (MPM), existing methods either rely on manual parameter tuning or distill dynamics from video diffusion models, limiting the generalization and optimization efficiency. Recent attempts using LLMs/VLMs suffer from a text/image-to-3D perceptual gap, yielding unstable physics behavior.

We propose FastPhysGS, a fast and robust framework for physics-based dynamic 3DGS simulation:(1) Instance-aware Particle Filling (IPF) with Monte Carlo Importance Sampling (MCIS) to efficiently populate interior particles while preserving geometric fidelity; (2) Bidirectional Graph Decoupling Optimization (BGDO), an adaptive strategy that rapidly optimizes material parameters predicted from a VLM.

Nevertheless, an important yet insufficiently explored research direction remains visual document image editing, which involves modifying textual content within images while faithfully preserving the original text style and background context. Existing approaches, including AnyText, GlyphControl, and TextCtrl, predominantly focus on English-language scenarios and documents with relatively sparse textual layouts, thereby failing to adequately address dense, structurally complex documents or non-Latin scripts such as Chinese.

The benchmark comprises a high-quality dataset encompassing densely textual documents in both English and Chinese, including academic papers, posters, presentation slides, examination materials, and newspapers. Furthermore, we introduce a decoupled evaluation framework that systematically quantifies editing performance at the OCR parsing level, enabling fine-grained assessment of text modification accuracy. Based on this benchmark, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of representative state-of-the-art image editing models.

In this work, we demonstrate that simplicity prevails over complex architectural designs. A simple linear classifier trained on the frozen features of modern Vision Foundation Models , including Perception Encoder, MetaCLIP 2, and DINOv3, establishes a new state-of-the-art. Through a comprehensive evaluation spanning traditional benchmarks, unseen generators, and challenging in-the-wild distributions, we show that this baseline not only matches specialized detectors on standard benchmarks but also decisively outperforms them on in-the-wild datasets, boosting accuracy by striking margins of over 30\\%. We posit that this superior capability is an emergent property driven by the massive scale of pre-training data containing synthetic content. We trace the source of this capability to two distinct manifestations of data exposure: Vision-Language Models internalize an explicit semantic concept of forgery, while Self-Supervised Learning models implicitly acquire discriminative forensic features from the pretraining data. However, we also reveal persistent limitations: these models suffer from performance degradation under recapture and transmission, remain blind to VAE reconstruction and localized editing.

While Post-Training Quantization (PTQ) enables efficient inference without retraining, conventional methods, primarily optimized for 2D Vision Transformers, fail to transfer effectively to 3D models due to intricate feature distributions and prohibitive calibration overhead. To address these challenges, we propose TAPTQ, a Tail-Aware Post-Training Quantization pipeline specifically engineered for 3D geometric learning. Our contribution is threefold: (1) To overcome the data-scale bottleneck in 3D datasets, we develop a progressive coarse-to-fine calibration construction strategy that constructs a highly compact subset to achieve both statistical purity and geometric representativeness. (2) We reformulate the quantization interval search as an optimization problem and introduce a ternary-search-based solver, reducing the computational complexity from $\\mathcal{O}(N)$ to $\\mathcal{O}(\\log N)$ for accelerated deployment. (3) To mitigate quantization error accumulation, we propose TRE-Guided Module-wise Compensation, which utilizes a Tail Relative Error (TRE) metric to adaptively identify and rectify distortions in modules sensitive to long-tailed activation outliers. Extensive experiments on the VGGT and Pi3 benchmarks demonstrate that TAPTQ consistently outperforms state-of-the-art PTQ methods in accuracy while significantly reducing calibration time.

The final object matching score combines semantic similarity with the predicted IoU, enabling more accurate retrieval. (2) Versatility: It seamlessly handles both region-level and image-level tasks.

Recent approaches combining 3D Gaussian splatting and physics engines can produce physically plausible videos, but are hindered by high computational costs in both reconstruction and simulation, and often lack robustness in complex real-world scenarios. To address these issues, we introduce Neural Gaussian Force Field (NGFF), an end-to-end neural framework that integrates 3D Gaussian perception with physics-based dynamic modeling to generate interactive, physically realistic 4D videos from multi-view RGB inputs, achieving two orders of magnitude faster than prior Gaussian simulators. To support training, we also present GSCollision, a 4D Gaussian dataset featuring diverse materials, multi-object interactions, and complex scenes, totaling over 640k rendered physical videos (~4 TB). Evaluations on synthetic and real 3D scenarios show NGFF's strong generalization and robustness in physical reasoning, advancing video prediction towards physics-grounded world models.", "AI": {"tldr": "NGFF\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u795e\u7ecf\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7ed3\u54083D\u9ad8\u65af\u611f\u77e5\u4e0e\u7269\u7406\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u4ece\u591a\u89c6\u89d2RGB\u8f93\u5165\u751f\u6210\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u3001\u7269\u7406\u771f\u5b9e\u76844D\u89c6\u9891\uff0c\u901f\u5ea6\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709\u9ad8\u65af\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u5feb\u4e24\u4e2a\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u867d\u7136\u89c6\u89c9\u8d28\u91cf\u9ad8\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7269\u7406\u5b9a\u5f8b\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u4e00\u81f4\u751f\u6210\u7269\u7406\u5408\u7406\u7684\u89c6\u9891\uff1b\u800c\u7ed3\u54083D\u9ad8\u65af\u6e85\u5c04\u548c\u7269\u7406\u5f15\u64ce\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff0c\u5728\u590d\u6742\u73b0\u5b9e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7f3a\u4e4f\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u795e\u7ecf\u9ad8\u65af\u529b\u573a(NGFF)\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u96c6\u62103D\u9ad8\u65af\u611f\u77e5\u4e0e\u57fa\u4e8e\u7269\u7406\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u5efa\u6a21\uff1b\u540c\u65f6\u521b\u5efaGSCollision\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u591a\u6837\u6750\u6599\u3001\u591a\u7269\u4f53\u4ea4\u4e92\u548c\u590d\u6742\u573a\u666f\u768464\u4e07+\u6e32\u67d3\u7269\u7406\u89c6\u9891\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u5408\u6210\u548c\u771f\u5b9e3D\u573a\u666f\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\uff0cNGFF\u5c55\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u7269\u7406\u63a8\u7406\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u901f\u5ea6\u6bd4\u5148\u524d\u9ad8\u65af\u6a21\u62df\u5668\u5feb\u4e24\u4e2a\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u89c6\u9891\u9884\u6d4b\u5411\u7269\u7406\u57fa\u7840\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u53d1\u5c55\u3002", "conclusion": "NGFF\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u54083D\u611f\u77e5\u4e0e\u7269\u7406\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u7269\u7406\u771f\u5b9e4D\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u4e3a\u6784\u5efa\u7269\u7406\u57fa\u7840\u7684\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u8fdb\u5c55\u3002"}}

In previous works, we presented a system developed on a university campus to monitor parking availability by estimating the number of free spaces from vehicle counts within a region of interest. Although this approach achieved good accuracy, it restricted the system's ability to provide spot-level insights and support more advanced applications. To overcome this limitation, we extend the system with a spot-wise monitoring strategy based on a distance-aware matching method with spatial tolerance, enhanced through an Adaptive Bounding Box Partitioning method for challenging spaces. The proposed approach achieves a balanced accuracy of 98.80% while maintaining an inference time of 8 seconds on a resource-constrained edge device, enhancing the capabilities of YOLOv11m, a model that has a size of 40.5 MB. In addition, two new components were introduced: (i) a Digital Shadow that visually represents parking lot entities as a base to evolve to a full Digital Twin, and (ii) an application support server based on a repurposed TV box. The latter not only enables scalable communication among cloud services, the parking totem, and a bot that provides detailed spot occupancy statistics, but also promotes hardware reuse as a step towards greater sustainability.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u8ddd\u79bb\u611f\u77e5\u5339\u914d\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8fb9\u754c\u6846\u5206\u5272\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u505c\u8f66\u4f4d\u7ea7\u76d1\u6d4b\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e8698.80%\u7684\u5e73\u8861\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u548c8\u79d2\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u5e76\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\u96cf\u5f62\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u7535\u89c6\u76d2\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u652f\u6301\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u533a\u57df\u8f66\u8f86\u8ba1\u6570\u7684\u505c\u8f66\u76d1\u6d4b\u7cfb\u7edf\u867d\u7136\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0d\u9519\uff0c\u4f46\u65e0\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u8f66\u4f4d\u7ea7\u6d1e\u5bdf\u548c\u652f\u6301\u66f4\u9ad8\u7ea7\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u4ef7\u503c\u3002", "method": "1. \u91c7\u7528\u57fa\u4e8e\u7a7a\u95f4\u5bb9\u5dee\u7684\u8ddd\u79bb\u611f\u77e5\u5339\u914d\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b0\u8f66\u4f4d\u7ea7\u76d1\u6d4b\uff1b2. \u9488\u5bf9\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7a7a\u95f4\u63d0\u51fa\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u8fb9\u754c\u6846\u5206\u5272\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1b3. \u4f7f\u7528YOLOv11m\u6a21\u578b\uff0840.5MB\u5927\u5c0f\uff09\uff1b4. \u5f15\u5165\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\u96cf\u5f62\u548c\u57fa\u4e8e\u7535\u89c6\u76d2\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u652f\u6301\u670d\u52a1\u5668\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u8d44\u6e90\u53d7\u9650\u7684\u8fb9\u7f18\u8bbe\u5907\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e8698.80%\u7684\u5e73\u8861\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\u4e3a8\u79d2\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u7cfb\u7edf\u652f\u6301\u8f66\u4f4d\u7ea7\u76d1\u6d4b\u548c\u66f4\u9ad8\u7ea7\u5e94\u7528\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u8f66\u4f4d\u7ea7\u76d1\u6d4b\u7cfb\u7edf\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u667a\u80fd\u505c\u8f66\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u786c\u4ef6\u91cd\u7528\u4fc3\u8fdb\u4e86\u53ef\u6301\u7eed\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u5b8c\u6574\u7684\u6570\u5b57\u5b6a\u751f\u7cfb\u7edf\u5960\u5b9a\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u3002"}}

Initialy submitted for IJCAI 2026", "summary": "Foundation models pretrained on large-scale histopathology data have found great success in various fields of computational pathology, but their impact on regressive biomarker prediction remains underexplored. In this work, we systematically evaluate histopathological foundation models for regression-based tasks, demonstrated through the prediction of homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) score - a critical biomarker for personalized cancer treatment. Within multiple instance learning frameworks, we extract patch-level features from whole slide images (WSI) using five state-of-the-art foundation models, and evaluate their impact compared to contrastive learning-based features. Models are trained to predict continuous HRD scores based on these extracted features across breast, endometrial, and lung cancer cohorts from two public medical data collections. Extensive experiments demonstrate that models trained on foundation model features consistently outperform the baseline in terms of predictive accuracy and generalization capabilities while exhibiting systematic differences among the foundation models. Additionally, we propose a distribution-based upsampling strategy to mitigate target imbalance in these datasets, significantly improving the recall and balanced accuracy for underrepresented but clinically important patient populations.

To achieve this goal, we propose a novel concept of single-image fusion, which extends conventional data-level fusion to the knowledge level. Specifically, we develop MagicFuse, a novel single image fusion framework capable of deriving a comprehensive cross-spectral scene representation from a single low-quality visible image. MagicFuse first introduces an intra-spectral knowledge reinforcement branch and a cross-spectral knowledge generation branch based on the diffusion models. They mine scene information obscured in the visible spectrum and learn thermal radiation distribution patterns transferred to the infrared spectrum, respectively. Building on them, we design a multi-domain knowledge fusion branch that integrates the probabilistic noise from the diffusion streams of these two branches, from which a cross-spectral scene representation can be obtained through successive sampling. Then, we impose both visual and semantic constraints to ensure that this scene representation can satisfy human observation while supporting downstream semantic decision-making. Extensive experiments show that our MagicFuse achieves visual and semantic representation performance comparable to or even better than state-of-the-art fusion methods with multi-modal inputs, despite relying solely on a single degraded visible image.", "AI": {"tldr": "MagicFuse\uff1a\u4e00\u79cd\u4ece\u5355\u5f20\u4f4e\u8d28\u91cf\u53ef\u89c1\u5149\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u8de8\u5149\u8c31\u573a\u666f\u8868\u793a\u7684\u5355\u56fe\u50cf\u878d\u5408\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u6316\u6398\u53ef\u89c1\u5149\u8c31\u4e2d\u88ab\u906e\u6321\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u5e76\u5b66\u4e60\u7ea2\u5916\u5149\u8c31\u7684\u70ed\u8f90\u5c04\u5206\u5e03\u6a21\u5f0f", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5728\u6076\u52a3\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u53ea\u6709\u53ef\u89c1\u5149\u6210\u50cf\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u53ef\u7528\u65f6\uff0c\u5982\u4f55\u7ee7\u7eed\u53d7\u76ca\u4e8e\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u56fe\u50cf\u878d\u5408\u4f18\u52bf\u7684\u5b9e\u9645\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u4f20\u7edf\u6570\u636e\u7ea7\u878d\u5408\u9700\u8981\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8f93\u5165\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u67d0\u4e9b\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u65e0\u6cd5\u83b7\u53d6\u7ea2\u5916\u7b49\u6a21\u6001\u6570\u636e\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5355\u56fe\u50cf\u878d\u5408\u6982\u5ff5\uff0c\u5c06\u6570\u636e\u7ea7\u878d\u5408\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u77e5\u8bc6\u7ea7\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u8bbe\u8ba1\u4e09\u4e2a\u5206\u652f\uff1a1) \u5149\u8c31\u5185\u77e5\u8bc6\u589e\u5f3a\u5206\u652f\u6316\u6398\u53ef\u89c1\u5149\u8c31\u4e2d\u88ab\u906e\u6321\u7684\u573a\u666f\u4fe1\u606f\uff1b2) \u8de8\u5149\u8c31\u77e5\u8bc6\u751f\u6210\u5206\u652f\u5b66\u4e60\u8f6c\u79fb\u5230\u7ea2\u5916\u5149\u8c31\u7684\u70ed\u8f90\u5c04\u5206\u5e03\u6a21\u5f0f\uff1b3) \u591a\u57df\u77e5\u8bc6\u878d\u5408\u5206\u652f\u6574\u5408\u4e24\u4e2a\u5206\u652f\u7684\u6982\u7387\u566a\u58f0\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8fde\u7eed\u91c7\u6837\u83b7\u5f97\u8de8\u5149\u8c31\u573a\u666f\u8868\u793a\u3002\u540c\u65f6\u65bd\u52a0\u89c6\u89c9\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u7ea6\u675f\u786e\u4fdd\u8868\u793a\u6ee1\u8db3\u4eba\u7c7b\u89c2\u5bdf\u5e76\u652f\u6301\u4e0b\u6e38\u8bed\u4e49\u51b3\u7b56\u3002", "result": "\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cMagicFuse\u4ec5\u4f9d\u8d56\u5355\u5f20\u9000\u5316\u7684\u53ef\u89c1\u5149\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u5c31\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e0e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8f93\u5165\u878d\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u5f53\u751a\u81f3\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u8868\u793a\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "MagicFuse\u6210\u529f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4ece\u5355\u5f20\u53ef\u89c1\u5149\u56fe\u50cf\u5230\u8de8\u5149\u8c31\u573a\u666f\u8868\u793a\u7684\u8f6c\u6362\uff0c\u4e3a\u5728\u53ea\u6709\u53ef\u89c1\u5149\u4f20\u611f\u5668\u53ef\u7528\u7684\u6076\u52a3\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u4fdd\u6301\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u878d\u5408\u4f18\u52bf\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5c06\u6570\u636e\u7ea7\u878d\u5408\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u77e5\u8bc6\u7ea7\u878d\u5408\u7684\u65b0\u8303\u5f0f\u3002"}}

Conventional vision-based methods that use deep-learning approaches for person recognition provide image information but are sensitive to lighting and visibility conditions and often violate privacy regulations, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in the European Union. Typically, detection systems based on deep learning require annotated data for training. Collecting and annotating such data, however, is highly time-consuming and due to manual treatments not necessarily error free. Therefore, this paper presents a privacy-compliant approach based on Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems LiDAR (MEMS-LiDAR), which exclusively captures anonymized 3D point clouds and avoids personal identification features. To compensate for the large amount of time required to record real LiDAR data and for post-processing and annotation, real recordings are augmented with synthetically generated scenes from the CARLA simulation framework. The results demonstrate that the hybrid data improves the average precision by 44 percentage points compared to a model trained exclusively with real data while reducing the manual annotation effort by 50 %. Thus, the proposed approach provides a scalable, cost-efficient alternative to purely real-data-based methods and systematically shows how synthetic LiDAR data can combine high performance in person detection with GDPR compliance in an industrial environment.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u57fa\u4e8eMEMS-LiDAR\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u5408\u89c4\u4eba\u5458\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u51cf\u5c11\u6807\u6ce8\u5de5\u4f5c\u91cf50%\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u68c0\u6d4b\u7cbe\u5ea644\u4e2a\u767e\u5206\u70b9", "motivation": "\u5de5\u4e1a\u5ba4\u5185\u5b89\u5168\u7a7a\u95f4\u9700\u8981\u53ef\u9760\u68c0\u6d4b\u672a\u6388\u6743\u4eba\u5458\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u89c6\u89c9\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u9690\u79c1\u5408\u89c4\u95ee\u9898\u4e14\u6570\u636e\u6807\u6ce8\u8017\u65f6\u8d39\u529b", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528MEMS-LiDAR\u91c7\u96c6\u533f\u540d3D\u70b9\u4e91\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408CARLA\u4eff\u771f\u6846\u67b6\u751f\u6210\u5408\u6210\u573a\u666f\u6570\u636e\u589e\u5f3a\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e", "result": "\u6df7\u5408\u6570\u636e\u76f8\u6bd4\u7eaf\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u5e73\u5747\u7cbe\u5ea6\u63d0\u534744\u4e2a\u767e\u5206\u70b9\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u51cf\u5c1150%\u7684\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u5de5\u4f5c\u91cf", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u3001\u6210\u672c\u6548\u76ca\u9ad8\u7684\u9690\u79c1\u5408\u89c4\u4eba\u5458\u68c0\u6d4b\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5728\u5de5\u4e1a\u73af\u5883\u4e2d\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u4e0eGDPR\u5408\u89c4\u6027\u7684\u5e73\u8861"}}

However, the substantial computational overhead of existing dense Transformerbased models significantly hinders real-time deployment. To address this efficiency-performance bottleneck, we introduce DDP-WM, a novel world model centered on the principle of Disentangled Dynamics Prediction (DDP). We hypothesize that latent state evolution in observed scenes is heterogeneous and can be decomposed into sparse primary dynamics driven by physical interactions and secondary context-driven background updates. DDP-WM realizes this decomposition through an architecture that integrates efficient historical processing with dynamic localization to isolate primary dynamics. By employing a crossattention mechanism for background updates, the framework optimizes resource allocation and provides a smooth optimization landscape for planners. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DDP-WM achieves significant efficiency and performance across diverse tasks, including navigation, precise tabletop manipulation, and complex deformable or multi-body interactions. Specifically, on the challenging Push-T task, DDP-WM achieves an approximately 9 times inference speedup and improves the MPC success rate from 90% to98% compared to state-of-the-art dense models.

UAV and other mobile laser-scanning techniques provide efficient means of collecting point clouds from rock faces. However, the development of a robust and efficient approach for automatic characterisation of discontinuity sets in real-world scenarios, like fully enclosed rock faces in cavities, remains an open research problem. In this study, a new approach is proposed for automatic discontinuity set characterisation that uses a single-shot filtering strategy, an innovative cyclic orientation transformation scheme and a hierarchical clustering technique. The single-shot filtering step isolates planar regions while robustly suppressing noise and high-curvature artefacts in one pass using a signal-processing technique. To address the limitations of Cartesian clustering on polar orientation data, a cyclic orientation transformation scheme is developed, enabling accurate representation of dip angle and dip direction in Cartesian space. The transformed orientations are then characterised into sets using a hierarchical clustering technique, which handles varying density distributions and identifies clusters without requiring user-defined set numbers. The accuracy of the method is validated on real-world mine stope and against ground truth obtained using manually handpicked discontinuity planes identified with the Virtual Compass tool, as well as widely used automated structure mapping techniques. The proposed approach outperforms the other techniques by exhibiting the lowest mean absolute error in estimating discontinuity set orientations in real-world stope data with errors of 1.95\u00b0 and 2.20\u00b0 in nominal dip angle and dip direction, respectively, and dispersion errors lying below 3\u00b0.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u5355\u6b21\u6ee4\u6ce2\u3001\u5faa\u73af\u65b9\u5411\u53d8\u6362\u548c\u5c42\u6b21\u805a\u7c7b\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u4e0d\u8fde\u7eed\u9762\u8868\u5f81\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u5730\u4e0b\u77ff\u5c71\u5ca9\u4f53\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30", "motivation": "\u5730\u4e0b\u77ff\u5c71\u5ca9\u4f53\u4e0d\u8fde\u7eed\u9762\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u8868\u5f81\u5bf9\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u5ca9\u4f53\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u3001\u5f00\u6316\u5b89\u5168\u548c\u8fd0\u8425\u6548\u7387\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002\u867d\u7136\u65e0\u4eba\u673a\u548c\u79fb\u52a8\u6fc0\u5149\u626b\u63cf\u6280\u672f\u80fd\u9ad8\u6548\u91c7\u96c6\u70b9\u4e91\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5b8c\u5168\u5c01\u95ed\u7684\u5ca9\u4f53\u8868\u9762\u7b49\u5b9e\u9645\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u9c81\u68d2\u4e14\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u8868\u5f81\u65b9\u6cd5\u4ecd\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5f00\u653e\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u4e0d\u8fde\u7eed\u9762\u8868\u5f81\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e09\u4e2a\u6838\u5fc3\u6b65\u9aa4\uff1a1) \u5355\u6b21\u6ee4\u6ce2\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u4fe1\u53f7\u5904\u7406\u6280\u672f\u4e00\u6b21\u6027\u9694\u79bb\u5e73\u9762\u533a\u57df\u5e76\u6291\u5236\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u9ad8\u66f2\u7387\u4f2a\u5f71\uff1b2) \u521b\u65b0\u7684\u5faa\u73af\u65b9\u5411\u53d8\u6362\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u7b1b\u5361\u5c14\u805a\u7c7b\u5bf9\u6781\u5750\u6807\u65b9\u5411\u6570\u636e\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u503e\u89d2\u548c\u503e\u5411\u5728\u7b1b\u5361\u5c14\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u8868\u793a\uff1b3) \u5c42\u6b21\u805a\u7c7b\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u5904\u7406\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u5bc6\u5ea6\u5206\u5e03\u5e76\u8bc6\u522b\u805a\u7c7b\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u7528\u6237\u5b9a\u4e49\u805a\u7c7b\u6570\u91cf\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u77ff\u5c71\u91c7\u573a\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u4e0e\u4f7f\u7528Virtual Compass\u5de5\u5177\u624b\u52a8\u9009\u53d6\u7684\u4e0d\u8fde\u7eed\u9762\u4ee5\u53ca\u5e7f\u6cdb\u4f7f\u7528\u7684\u81ea\u52a8\u7ed3\u6784\u6620\u5c04\u6280\u672f\u8fdb\u884c\u5bf9\u6bd4\u3002\u6240\u63d0\u65b9\u6cd5\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u6700\u4f4e\u7684\u5e73\u5747\u7edd\u5bf9\u8bef\u5dee\uff1a\u503e\u89d2\u8bef\u5dee1.95\u00b0\uff0c\u503e\u5411\u8bef\u5dee2.20\u00b0\uff0c\u79bb\u6563\u8bef\u5dee\u4f4e\u4e8e3\u00b0\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u5176\u4ed6\u6280\u672f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u5355\u6b21\u6ee4\u6ce2\u3001\u5faa\u73af\u65b9\u5411\u53d8\u6362\u548c\u5c42\u6b21\u805a\u7c7b\u7684\u7ec4\u5408\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5bf9\u5730\u4e0b\u77ff\u5c71\u5ca9\u4f53\u4e0d\u8fde\u7eed\u9762\u7684\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u51c6\u786e\u81ea\u52a8\u8868\u5f81\uff0c\u4e3a\u5ca9\u4f53\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u8bc4\u4f30\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u6280\u672f\u652f\u6301\u3002"}}

However, their core attention layers become a major bottleneck at inference time: as generation progresses, the KV cache grows, causing both increasing latency and escalating GPU memory, which in turn restricts usable temporal context and harms long-range consistency. In this work, we study redundancy in autoregressive video diffusion and identify three persistent sources: near-duplicate cached keys across frames, slowly evolving (largely semantic) queries/keys that make many attention computations redundant, and cross-attention over long prompts where only a small subset of tokens matters per frame. Building on these observations, we propose a unified, training-free attention framework for autoregressive diffusion: TempCache compresses the KV cache via temporal correspondence to bound cache growth; AnnCA accelerates cross-attention by selecting frame-relevant prompt tokens using fast approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) matching; and AnnSA sparsifies self-attention by restricting each query to semantically matched keys, also using a lightweight ANN. Together, these modules reduce attention, compute, and memory and are compatible with existing autoregressive diffusion backbones and world models. Experiments demonstrate up to x5--x10 end-to-end speedups while preserving near-identical visual quality and, crucially, maintaining stable throughput and nearly constant peak GPU memory usage over long rollouts, where prior methods progressively slow down and suffer from increasing memory usage.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9488\u5bf9\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u514d\u8d39\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e09\u79cd\u6280\u672f\u51cf\u5c11\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u5f00\u9500\uff1aTempCache\u538b\u7f29KV\u7f13\u5b58\uff0cAnnCA\u52a0\u901f\u4ea4\u53c9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\uff0cAnnSA\u7a00\u758f\u5316\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b05-10\u500d\u52a0\u901f\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u89c6\u89c9\u8d28\u91cf\u7a33\u5b9a\u3002", "motivation": "\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u9762\u4e34\u6838\u5fc3\u74f6\u9888\uff1a\u968f\u7740\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u8fdb\u884c\uff0cKV\u7f13\u5b58\u4e0d\u65ad\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5ef6\u8fdf\u589e\u52a0\u548cGPU\u5185\u5b58\u5360\u7528\u4e0a\u5347\uff0c\u8fd9\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u53ef\u7528\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5e76\u635f\u5bb3\u957f\u7a0b\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002\u9700\u8981\u89e3\u51b3\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u4e2d\u7684\u5197\u4f59\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u514d\u8d39\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1) TempCache\u901a\u8fc7\u65f6\u95f4\u5bf9\u5e94\u6027\u538b\u7f29KV\u7f13\u5b58\u4ee5\u9650\u5236\u7f13\u5b58\u589e\u957f\uff1b2) AnnCA\u4f7f\u7528\u5feb\u901f\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6700\u8fd1\u90bb\u5339\u914d\u9009\u62e9\u5e27\u76f8\u5173\u63d0\u793a\u8bcd\u6765\u52a0\u901f\u4ea4\u53c9\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\uff1b3) AnnSA\u901a\u8fc7\u9650\u5236\u6bcf\u4e2a\u67e5\u8be2\u5230\u8bed\u4e49\u5339\u914d\u7684\u952e\u6765\u7a00\u758f\u5316\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\uff0c\u540c\u6837\u4f7f\u7528\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7ANN\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b9e\u73b05-10\u500d\u7aef\u5230\u7aef\u52a0\u901f\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u8fd1\u4e4e\u76f8\u540c\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u8d28\u91cf\u3002\u66f4\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u662f\uff0c\u5728\u957f\u5e8f\u5217\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u4fdd\u6301\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u548c\u8fd1\u4e4e\u6052\u5b9a\u7684\u5cf0\u503cGPU\u5185\u5b58\u4f7f\u7528\uff0c\u800c\u5148\u524d\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f1a\u9010\u6e10\u53d8\u6162\u4e14\u5185\u5b58\u4f7f\u7528\u4e0d\u65ad\u589e\u52a0\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6846\u67b6\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u5229\u7528\u4e09\u79cd\u5197\u4f59\u6765\u6e90\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u4e3a\u957f\u683c\u5f0f\u5408\u6210\u3001\u89c6\u9891\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u4ea4\u4e92\u5f0f\u795e\u7ecf\u6e38\u620f\u5f15\u64ce\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Existing approaches have shown promise in reducing the number of diffusion steps, but they often suffer from significant quality degradation when applied to video generation. We propose Guided Progressive Distillation (GPD), a framework that accelerates the diffusion process for fast and high-quality video generation. GPD introduces a novel training strategy in which a teacher model progressively guides a student model to operate with larger step sizes. The framework consists of two key components: (1) an online-generated training target that reduces optimization difficulty while improving computational efficiency, and (2) frequency-domain constraints in the latent space that promote the preservation of fine-grained details and temporal dynamics. Applied to the Wan2.1 model, GPD reduces the number of sampling steps from 48 to 6 while maintaining competitive visual quality on VBench. Compared with existing distillation methods, GPD demonstrates clear advantages in both pipeline simplicity and quality preservation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faGPD\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6e10\u8fdb\u84b8\u998f\u52a0\u901f\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u91c7\u6837\uff0c\u5c06\u91c7\u6837\u6b65\u6570\u4ece48\u51cf\u5c11\u52306\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u89c6\u89c9\u8d28\u91cf", "motivation": "\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u663e\u8457\u6210\u529f\uff0c\u4f46\u53bb\u566a\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u4ecd\u7136\u662f\u4e3b\u8981\u74f6\u9888\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u51cf\u5c11\u6269\u6563\u6b65\u6570\u65b9\u9762\u6709\u6f5c\u529b\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u5e94\u7528\u65f6\u5f80\u5f80\u4f1a\u51fa\u73b0\u660e\u663e\u7684\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5f15\u5bfc\u6e10\u8fdb\u84b8\u998f(GPD)\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u4e24\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff1a1)\u5728\u7ebf\u751f\u6210\u8bad\u7ec3\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u964d\u4f4e\u4f18\u5316\u96be\u5ea6\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\uff1b2)\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u7684\u9891\u57df\u7ea6\u675f\uff0c\u4fc3\u8fdb\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u7ec6\u8282\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u4fdd\u6301\u3002\u6559\u5e08\u6a21\u578b\u9010\u6b65\u6307\u5bfc\u5b66\u751f\u6a21\u578b\u4ee5\u66f4\u5927\u7684\u6b65\u957f\u64cd\u4f5c\u3002", "result": "\u5e94\u7528\u4e8eWan2.1\u6a21\u578b\u65f6\uff0cGPD\u5c06\u91c7\u6837\u6b65\u6570\u4ece48\u51cf\u5c11\u52306\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5728VBench\u4e0a\u4fdd\u6301\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u8d28\u91cf\u3002\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709\u84b8\u998f\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0cGPD\u5728\u6d41\u7a0b\u7b80\u5355\u6027\u548c\u8d28\u91cf\u4fdd\u6301\u65b9\u9762\u90fd\u663e\u793a\u51fa\u660e\u663e\u4f18\u52bf\u3002", "conclusion": "GPD\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u5feb\u901f\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u6709\u6548\u7684\u6269\u6563\u8fc7\u7a0b\u52a0\u901f\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5728\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e86\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u3002"}}

At high noise, data-consistency gradients computed from inaccurate estimates can be geometrically incongruent with the posterior geometry, inducing early-step drift, spurious high-frequency artifacts, plus sensitivity to schedules and ill-conditioned operators. To address these concerns, we propose a noise--frequency Continuation framework that constructs a continuous family of intermediate posteriors whose likelihood enforces measurement consistency only within a noise-dependent frequency band. This principle is instantiated with a stabilized posterior sampler that combines a diffusion predictor, band-limited likelihood guidance, and a multi-resolution consistency strategy that aggressively commits reliable coarse corrections while conservatively adopting high-frequency details only when they become identifiable.

To address this gap, we introduce VIA-Bench, a challenging benchmark designed to probe model performance on visual illusions and anomalies. It includes six core categories: color illusions, motion illusions, gestalt illusions, geometric and spatial illusions, general visual illusions, and visual anomalies. Through careful human-in-the-loop review, we construct over 1K high-quality question-answer pairs that require nuanced visual reasoning. Extensive evaluation of over 20 state-of-the-art MLLMs, including proprietary, open-source, and reasoning-enhanced models, uncovers significant vulnerabilities. Notably, we find that Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning offers negligible robustness, often yielding ``brittle mirages'' where the model's logic collapses under illusory stimuli.

However, existing multimodal models predominantly treat this task as a black-box classification, often confusing physically distinct motions by relying on superficial visual patterns rather than geometric cues. We present CamReasoner, a framework that reformulates camera movement understanding as a structured inference process to bridge the gap between perception and cinematic logic. Our approach centers on the Observation-Thinking-Answer (O-T-A) paradigm, which compels the model to decode spatio-temporal cues such as trajectories and view frustums within an explicit reasoning block. To instill this capability, we construct a Large-scale Inference Trajectory Suite comprising 18k SFT reasoning chains and 38k RL feedback samples. Notably, we are the first to employ RL for logical alignment in this domain, ensuring motion inferences are grounded in physical geometry rather than contextual guesswork.

Traditional cross-country data collection relies on extensive on-road driving, making it costly and inefficient to identify representative locations. To address this, we propose a street-view-guided data acquisition strategy that leverages publicly available imagery to identify places of interest (POI). Two POI scoring methods are introduced: a KNN-based feature distance approach using a vision foundation model, and a visual-attribution approach using a vision-language model. To enable repeatable evaluation, we adopt a collect-detect protocol and construct a co-located dataset by pairing the Zenseact Open Dataset with Mapillary street-view images. Experiments on traffic sign detection, a task particularly sensitive to cross-country variations in sign appearance, show that our approach achieves performance comparable to random sampling while using only half of the target-domain data. We further provide cost estimations for full-country analysis, demonstrating that large-scale street-view processing remains economically feasible.

However, we observe that current detectors primarily rely on global artifacts that appear as inpainting side effects, rather than on locally synthesized content. We show that this behavior occurs because VAE-based reconstruction induces a subtle but pervasive spectral shift across the entire image, including unedited regions. To isolate this effect, we introduce Inpainting Exchange (INP-X), an operation that restores original pixels outside the edited region while preserving all synthesized content. We create a 90K test dataset including real, inpainted, and exchanged images to evaluate this phenomenon. Under this intervention, pretrained state-of-the-art detectors, including commercial ones, exhibit a dramatic drop in accuracy (e.g., from 91\\% to 55\\%), frequently approaching chance level. We provide a theoretical analysis linking this behavior to high-frequency attenuation caused by VAE information bottlenecks. Our findings highlight the need for content-aware detection.

A practical solution should leverage vision foundation models (VFMs) to mitigate infrared data scarcity, while adopting a memory-attention-based temporal propagation framework that unifies single- and multi-frame inference. However, infrared small targets exhibit weak radiometric signals and limited semantic cues, which differ markedly from visible-spectrum imagery. This modality gap makes direct use of semantics-oriented VFMs and appearance-driven cross-frame association unreliable for IRSTD: hierarchical feature aggregation can submerge localized target peaks, and appearance-only memory attention becomes ambiguous, leading to spurious clutter associations. To address these challenges, we propose SPIRIT, a unified and VFM-compatible framework that adapts VFMs to IRSTD via lightweight physics-informed plug-ins. Spatially, PIFR refines features by approximating rank-sparsity decomposition to suppress structured background components and enhance sparse target-like signals. Temporally, PGMA injects history-derived soft spatial priors into memory cross-attention to constrain cross-frame association, enabling robust video detection while naturally reverting to single-frame inference when temporal context is absent.

This motivates a shift toward IMU Temporal Action Localization (IMU-TAL), which predicts both action categories and their start/end times in continuous streams. However, current progress is strongly bottlenecked by the need for dense, frame-level boundary annotations, which are costly and difficult to scale. To address this bottleneck, we introduce WS-IMUBench, a systematic benchmark study of weakly supervised IMU-TAL (WS-IMU-TAL) under only sequence-level labels. Rather than proposing a new localization algorithm, we evaluate how well established weakly supervised localization paradigms from audio, image, and video transfer to IMU-TAL under only sequence-level labels. We benchmark seven representative weakly supervised methods on seven public IMU datasets, resulting in over 3,540 model training runs and 7,080 inference evaluations. Guided by three research questions on transferability, effectiveness, and insights, our findings show that (i) transfer is modality-dependent, with temporal-domain methods generally more stable than image-derived proposal-based approaches; (ii) weak supervision can be competitive on favorable datasets (e.g., with longer actions and higher-dimensional sensing); and (iii) dominant failure modes arise from short actions, temporal ambiguity, and proposal quality. Finally, we outline concrete directions for advancing WS-IMU-TAL (e.g., IMU-specific proposal generation, boundary-aware objectives, and stronger temporal reasoning). Beyond individual results, WS-IMUBench establishes a reproducible benchmarking template, datasets, protocols, and analyses, to accelerate community-wide progress toward scalable WS-IMU-TAL.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86WS-IMUBench\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u5f31\u76d1\u7763IMU\u65f6\u5e8f\u52a8\u4f5c\u5b9a\u4f4d\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u4ec5\u6709\u5e8f\u5217\u7ea7\u6807\u7b7e\u4e0b\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5b9e\u9a8c\u5206\u6790\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u5f31\u76d1\u7763\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u53ef\u8fc1\u79fb\u6027\u548c\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfIMU\u52a8\u4f5c\u8bc6\u522b\u53ea\u80fd\u5206\u7c7b\u526a\u8f91\u7247\u6bb5\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6355\u6349\u771f\u5b9e\u4e16\u754c\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u4e30\u5bcc\u65f6\u5e8f\u7ed3\u6784\u3002\u867d\u7136IMU\u65f6\u5e8f\u52a8\u4f5c\u5b9a\u4f4d\u80fd\u9884\u6d4b\u8fde\u7eed\u6d41\u4e2d\u7684\u52a8\u4f5c\u7c7b\u522b\u548c\u8d77\u6b62\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u4f46\u9700\u8981\u5bc6\u96c6\u7684\u5e27\u7ea7\u8fb9\u754c\u6807\u6ce8\uff0c\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u4e14\u96be\u4ee5\u6269\u5c55\u3002\u8fd9\u4fc3\u4f7f\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u8f6c\u5411\u5f31\u76d1\u7763\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u53ea\u9700\u5e8f\u5217\u7ea7\u6807\u7b7e\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165WS-IMUBench\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u8bc4\u4f30\u5f31\u76d1\u7763IMU\u65f6\u5e8f\u52a8\u4f5c\u5b9a\u4f4d\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002\u4e0d\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u8bc4\u4f30\u97f3\u9891\u3001\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u89c6\u9891\u9886\u57df\u7684\u73b0\u6709\u5f31\u76d1\u7763\u5b9a\u4f4d\u8303\u5f0f\u5728IMU\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u7684\u53ef\u8fc1\u79fb\u6027\u3002\u57287\u4e2a\u516c\u5171IMU\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u5bf97\u79cd\u4ee3\u8868\u6027\u5f31\u76d1\u7763\u65b9\u6cd5\u8fdb\u884c\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u5171\u8fdb\u884c3540\u6b21\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c7080\u6b21\u63a8\u7406\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff1a(1) \u53ef\u8fc1\u79fb\u6027\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u6a21\u6001\uff0c\u65f6\u57df\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u6bd4\u57fa\u4e8e\u56fe\u50cf\u63d0\u6848\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u66f4\u7a33\u5b9a\uff1b(2) \u5728\u6709\u5229\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff08\u5982\u52a8\u4f5c\u8f83\u957f\u3001\u4f20\u611f\u7ef4\u5ea6\u8f83\u9ad8\uff09\uff0c\u5f31\u76d1\u7763\u65b9\u6cd5\u53ef\u4ee5\u5177\u6709\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\uff1b(3) \u4e3b\u8981\u5931\u8d25\u6a21\u5f0f\u6e90\u4e8e\u77ed\u52a8\u4f5c\u3001\u65f6\u5e8f\u6a21\u7cca\u6027\u548c\u63d0\u6848\u8d28\u91cf\u3002\u8fd8\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u6539\u8fdb\u65b9\u5411\u3002", "conclusion": "WS-IMUBench\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u53ef\u590d\u73b0\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u6a21\u677f\u3001\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u3001\u534f\u8bae\u548c\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u4e3a\u793e\u533a\u52a0\u901f\u63a8\u8fdb\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u5f31\u76d1\u7763IMU\u65f6\u5e8f\u52a8\u4f5c\u5b9a\u4f4d\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u5f31\u76d1\u7763\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u5e76\u6307\u51fa\u4e86IMU\u7279\u5b9a\u63d0\u6848\u751f\u6210\u3001\u8fb9\u754c\u611f\u77e5\u76ee\u6807\u548c\u66f4\u5f3a\u65f6\u5e8f\u63a8\u7406\u7b49\u5177\u4f53\u6539\u8fdb\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

Existing deep learning methods achieve considerable accuracy but often lack transparency, leading to error drift and reduced clinical trust. We propose a novel Multi-Hop Visual Chain of Reasoning (VCoR) framework that reformulates registration as a progressive reasoning process. Inspired by the iterative nature of clinical decision-making, each visual reasoning hop integrates a Localized Spatial Refinement (LSR) module to enrich feature representations and a Cross-Reference Attention (CRA) mechanism that leads the iterative refinement process, preserving anatomical consistency. This multi-hop strategy enables robust handling of large deformations and produces a transparent sequence of intermediate predictions with a theoretical bound. Beyond accuracy, our framework offers built-in interpretability by estimating uncertainty via the stability and convergence of deformation fields across hops. Extensive evaluations on two challenging public datasets, DIR-Lab 4D CT (lung) and IXI T1-weighted MRI (brain), demonstrate that VCoR achieves competitive registration accuracy while offering rich intermediate visualizations and confidence measures.

To address this gap, we introduce VIBE, the Visual Instruction Benchmark for Image Editing with a three-level interaction hierarchy that captures deictic grounding, morphological manipulation, and causal reasoning. Across these levels, we curate high-quality and diverse test cases that reflect progressively increasing complexity in visual instruction following. We further propose a robust LMM-as-a-judge evaluation framework with task-specific metrics to enable scalable and fine-grained assessment. Through a comprehensive evaluation of 17 representative open-source and proprietary image editing models, we find that proprietary models exhibit early-stage visual instruction-following capabilities and consistently outperform open-source models.

Assessing the Role of Deepfake Detectors in Multimodal Misinformation Detection", "comment": null, "summary": "In multimodal misinformation, deception usually arises not just from pixel-level manipulations in an image, but from the semantic and contextual claim jointly expressed by the image-text pair. Yet most deepfake detectors, engineered to detect pixel-level forgeries, do not account for claim-level meaning, despite their growing integration in automated fact-checking (AFC) pipelines. This raises a central scientific and practical question: Do pixel-level detectors contribute useful signal for verifying image-text claims, or do they instead introduce misleading authenticity priors that undermine evidence-based reasoning? We provide the first systematic analysis of deepfake detectors in the context of multimodal misinformation detection. Using two complementary benchmarks, MMFakeBench and DGM4, we evaluate: (1) state-of-the-art image-only deepfake detectors, (2) an evidence-driven fact-checking system that performs tool-guided retrieval via Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) and engages in deliberative inference through Multi-Agent Debate (MAD), and (3) a hybrid fact-checking system that injects detector outputs as auxiliary evidence. Results across both benchmark datasets show that deepfake detectors offer limited standalone value, achieving F1 scores in the range of 0.26-0.53 on MMFakeBench and 0.33-0.49 on DGM4, and that incorporating their predictions into fact-checking pipelines consistently reduces performance by 0.04-0.08 F1 due to non-causal authenticity assumptions. In contrast, the evidence-centric fact-checking system achieves the highest performance, reaching F1 scores of approximately 0.81 on MMFakeBench and 0.55 on DGM4.

Existing literature either focuses only on first-order stationary points for minimax problems or on SOSP for classical stochastic minimization problems. This work provides, for the first time, a unified and detailed treatment of both empirical and population risks. Specifically, we propose a purely first-order method that combines a nested gradient descent--ascent scheme with SPIDER-style variance reduction and Gaussian perturbations to ensure privacy. A key technical device is a block-wise ($q$-period) analysis that controls the accumulation of stochastic variance and privacy noise without summing over the full iteration horizon, yielding a unified treatment of both empirical-risk and population formulations. Under standard smoothness, Hessian-Lipschitzness, and strong concavity assumptions, we establish high-probability guarantees for reaching an $(\u03b1,\\sqrt{\u03c1_\u03a6\u03b1})$-approximate second-order stationary point with $\u03b1= \\mathcal{O}( (\\frac{\\sqrt{d}}{n\\varepsilon})^{2/3})$ for empirical risk objectives and $\\mathcal{O}(\\frac{1}{n^{1/3}} + (\\frac{\\sqrt{d}}{n\\varepsilon})^{1/2})$ for population objectives, matching the best known rates for private first-order stationarity.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u9996\u6b21\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5728\u968f\u673a\u975e\u51f8\u6781\u5c0f\u6781\u5927\u4f18\u5316\u4e2d\u5bfb\u627e\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u4e8c\u9636\u5e73\u7a33\u70b9\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u7ed3\u5408\u5d4c\u5957\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d-\u4e0a\u5347\u3001SPIDER\u65b9\u5dee\u51cf\u5c11\u548c\u9ad8\u65af\u6270\u52a8\u7684\u7eaf\u4e00\u9636\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e3a\u7ecf\u9a8c\u98ce\u9669\u548c\u603b\u4f53\u98ce\u9669\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7edf\u4e00\u5904\u7406\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6587\u732e\u8981\u4e48\u53ea\u5173\u6ce8\u6781\u5c0f\u6781\u5927\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u4e00\u9636\u5e73\u7a33\u70b9\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u53ea\u5173\u6ce8\u7ecf\u5178\u968f\u673a\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u7684\u4e8c\u9636\u5e73\u7a33\u70b9\u3002\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u968f\u673a\u975e\u51f8\u6781\u5c0f\u6781\u5927\u4f18\u5316\u4e2d\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u4e8c\u9636\u5e73\u7a33\u70b9\u7684\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e3a\u7ecf\u9a8c\u98ce\u9669\u548c\u603b\u4f53\u98ce\u9669\u63d0\u4f9b\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u7eaf\u4e00\u9636\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5d4c\u5957\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d-\u4e0a\u5347\u65b9\u6848\u3001SPIDER\u98ce\u683c\u7684\u65b9\u5dee\u51cf\u5c11\u6280\u672f\u548c\u9ad8\u65af\u6270\u52a8\u6765\u786e\u4fdd\u9690\u79c1\u3002\u5173\u952e\u6280\u672f\u662f\u5757\u72b6\uff08q\u5468\u671f\uff09\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u63a7\u5236\u968f\u673a\u65b9\u5dee\u548c\u9690\u79c1\u566a\u58f0\u7684\u7d2f\u79ef\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5728\u6574\u4e2a\u8fed\u4ee3\u8303\u56f4\u5185\u6c42\u548c\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6807\u51c6\u5149\u6ed1\u6027\u3001Hessian-Lipschitz\u6027\u548c\u5f3a\u51f9\u6027\u5047\u8bbe\u4e0b\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u8fbe\u5230(\u03b1,\u221a(\u03c1_\u03a6\u03b1))\u8fd1\u4f3c\u4e8c\u9636\u5e73\u7a33\u70b9\u7684\u9ad8\u6982\u7387\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002\u7ecf\u9a8c\u98ce\u9669\u76ee\u6807\uff1a\u03b1=O((\u221ad/n\u03b5)^{2/3})\uff1b\u603b\u4f53\u76ee\u6807\uff1a\u03b1=O(1/n^{1/3} + (\u221ad/n\u03b5)^{1/2})\uff0c\u5339\u914d\u79c1\u6709\u4e00\u9636\u5e73\u7a33\u6027\u7684\u6700\u4f73\u5df2\u77e5\u901f\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u5de5\u4f5c\u9996\u6b21\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u968f\u673a\u6781\u5c0f\u6781\u5927\u4f18\u5316\u4e2d\u7684\u5dee\u5206\u9690\u79c1\u4e8c\u9636\u5e73\u7a33\u70b9\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u7ecf\u9a8c\u98ce\u9669\u548c\u603b\u4f53\u98ce\u9669\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u548c\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u8fbe\u5230\u4e86\u4e0e\u79c1\u6709\u4e00\u9636\u5e73\u7a33\u6027\u76f8\u5339\u914d\u7684\u6700\u4f73\u6536\u655b\u901f\u7387\u3002"}}

The redundant visual tokens engenders a substantial computational load and key-value (KV) cache footprint bottleneck. Existing approaches focus on token-wise optimization, leveraging diverse intricate token pruning techniques to eliminate non-crucial visual tokens. Nevertheless, these methods often unavoidably undermine the integrity of the KV cache, resulting in failures in long-text generation tasks. To this end, we conduct an in-depth investigation towards the attention mechanism of the model from a new perspective, and discern that attention within more than half of all decode layers are semantic similar. Upon this finding, we contend that the attention in certain layers can be streamlined by inheriting the attention from their preceding layers. Consequently, we propose Lazy Attention, an efficient attention mechanism that enables cross-layer sharing of similar attention patterns. It ingeniously reduces layer-wise redundant computation in attention. In Lazy Attention, we develop a novel layer-shared cache, Q Cache, tailored for MLLMs, which facilitates the reuse of queries across adjacent layers. In particular, Q Cache is lightweight and fully compatible with existing inference frameworks, including Flash Attention and KV cache. Additionally, our method is highly flexible as it is orthogonal to existing token-wise techniques and can be deployed independently or combined with token pruning approaches. Empirical evaluations on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our method can reduce KV cache usage by over 35% and achieve 1.5x throughput improvement, while sacrificing only approximately 1% of performance on various MLLMs. Compared with SOTA token-wise methods, our technique achieves superior accuracy preservation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51faLazy Attention\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8de8\u5c42\u5171\u4eab\u76f8\u4f3c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u5f0f\u6765\u51cf\u5c11\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\u7684\u5197\u4f59\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u964d\u4f4eKV\u7f13\u5b58\u5360\u7528\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u56e0\u89c6\u89c9\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u4ea7\u751f\u5927\u91cf\u89c6\u89c9token\u800c\u5bfc\u81f4\u63a8\u7406\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u6602\uff0c\u73b0\u6709token\u526a\u679d\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f1a\u7834\u574fKV\u7f13\u5b58\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u957f\u6587\u672c\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faLazy Attention\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u8d85\u8fc7\u4e00\u534a\u89e3\u7801\u5c42\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u4f3c\uff0c\u5141\u8bb8\u67d0\u4e9b\u5c42\u7ee7\u627f\u524d\u5c42\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002\u5f00\u53d1\u4e86\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7Q Cache\uff0c\u652f\u6301\u8de8\u5c42\u67e5\u8be2\u91cd\u7528\uff0c\u517c\u5bb9\u73b0\u6709\u63a8\u7406\u6846\u67b6\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u51cf\u5c11\u8d85\u8fc735%\u7684KV\u7f13\u5b58\u4f7f\u7528\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b01.5\u500d\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u63d0\u5347\uff0c\u4ec5\u727a\u7272\u7ea61%\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u73b0\u6709SOTA token\u526a\u679d\u65b9\u6cd5\u5177\u6709\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4fdd\u6301\u3002", "conclusion": "Lazy Attention\u901a\u8fc7\u8de8\u5c42\u5171\u4eab\u76f8\u4f3c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86MLLMs\u4e2d\u7684\u5197\u4f59\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u63a8\u7406\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0e\u73b0\u6709token\u526a\u679d\u6280\u672f\u6b63\u4ea4\u517c\u5bb9\u3002"}}

However, current state-of-the-art models often alter object details, omit or duplicate objects, and produce layouts with incorrect relative sizing or inconsistent item presentations. To bridge this gap, we introduce PLACID, a framework that transforms a collection of object images into an appealing multi-object composite. Our approach makes two main contributions. First, we leverage a pretrained image-to-video (I2V) diffusion model with text control to preserve objects consistency, identities, and background details by exploiting temporal priors from videos. Second, we propose a novel data curation strategy that generates synthetic sequences where randomly placed objects smoothly move to their target positions. This synthetic data aligns with the video model's temporal priors during training. At inference, objects initialized at random positions consistently converge into coherent layouts guided by text, with the final frame serving as the composite image. Extensive quantitative evaluations and user studies demonstrate that PLACID surpasses state-of-the-art methods in multi-object compositing, achieving superior identity, background, and color preservation, with less omitted objects and visually appealing results.", "AI": {"tldr": "PLACID\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5229\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u56fe\u50cf\u5230\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u8fdb\u884c\u591a\u7269\u4f53\u5408\u6210\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u89c6\u9891\u65f6\u95f4\u5148\u9a8c\u4fdd\u6301\u7269\u4f53\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u80cc\u666f\u7ec6\u8282\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u80fd\u751f\u6210\u89c6\u89c9\u5438\u5f15\u4eba\u7684\u591a\u7269\u4f53\u7ec4\u5408\u56fe\u50cf\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u751f\u6210\u5f0fAI\u5728\u7167\u7247\u7ea7\u56fe\u50cf\u5408\u6210\u65b9\u9762\u53d6\u5f97\u8fdb\u5c55\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5de5\u4f5c\u5ba4\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u591a\u7269\u4f53\u5408\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u8db3\uff1a\u65e0\u6cd5\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u7269\u4f53\u8eab\u4efd\u3001\u80cc\u666f\u8272\u5f69\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u3001\u5e03\u5c40\u8bbe\u8ba1\u63a7\u5236\u4ee5\u53ca\u5b8c\u6574\u5c55\u793a\u6240\u6709\u7269\u4f53\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u5e38\u6539\u53d8\u7269\u4f53\u7ec6\u8282\u3001\u9057\u6f0f\u6216\u91cd\u590d\u7269\u4f53\u3001\u4ea7\u751f\u9519\u8bef\u76f8\u5bf9\u5c3a\u5bf8\u6216\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u5c55\u793a\u3002", "method": "1. \u5229\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u56fe\u50cf\u5230\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6587\u672c\u63a7\u5236\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u5148\u9a8c\u4fdd\u6301\u7269\u4f53\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u80cc\u666f\u7ec6\u8282\uff1b2. \u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u6570\u636e\u7b56\u5c55\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u5408\u6210\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u968f\u673a\u653e\u7f6e\u7684\u7269\u4f53\u5e73\u6ed1\u79fb\u52a8\u5230\u76ee\u6807\u4f4d\u7f6e\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6570\u636e\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u4e0e\u89c6\u9891\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u5148\u9a8c\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002", "result": "\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7684\u5b9a\u91cf\u8bc4\u4f30\u548c\u7528\u6237\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0cPLACID\u5728\u591a\u7269\u4f53\u5408\u6210\u65b9\u9762\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u8eab\u4efd\u3001\u80cc\u666f\u548c\u8272\u5f69\u4fdd\u6301\uff0c\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u7269\u4f53\u9057\u6f0f\uff0c\u4ea7\u751f\u4e86\u89c6\u89c9\u4e0a\u66f4\u5438\u5f15\u4eba\u7684\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "PLACID\u6846\u67b6\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u591a\u7269\u4f53\u5408\u6210\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u89c6\u9891\u65f6\u95f4\u5148\u9a8c\u548c\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u751f\u6210\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u4e00\u81f4\u4e14\u89c6\u89c9\u5438\u5f15\u4eba\u7684\u591a\u7269\u4f53\u7ec4\u5408\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u4e3a\u5de5\u4f5c\u5ba4\u7ea7\u56fe\u50cf\u5408\u6210\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

However, recent work has shown that such pipelines suffer from severe temporal drift, where errors accumulate and amplify over long horizons. We hypothesize that this drift does not primarily stem from insufficient model capacity, but rather from inference-time error propagation. Specifically, we contend that drift arises from the uncontrolled reuse of corrupted latent conditioning tokens during auto-regressive inference. To correct this accumulation of errors, we propose a simple, inference-time method that mitigates temporal drift by identifying and removing unstable latent tokens before they are reused for conditioning. For this purpose, we define unstable tokens as latent tokens whose representations deviate significantly from those of the previously generated batch, indicating potential corruption or semantic drift. By explicitly removing corrupted latent tokens from the auto-regressive context, rather than modifying entire spatial regions or model parameters, our method prevents unreliable latent information from influencing future generation steps. As a result, it significantly improves long-horizon temporal consistency without modifying the model architecture, training procedure, or leaving latent space.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u79fb\u9664\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u6807\u8bb0\u6765\u7f13\u89e3\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u6f02\u79fb\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u4fee\u6539\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u6216\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "motivation": "\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u5728\u751f\u6210\u957f\u89c6\u9891\u65f6\u5b58\u5728\u4e25\u91cd\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u6f02\u79fb\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u8bef\u5dee\u4f1a\u968f\u65f6\u95f4\u7d2f\u79ef\u548c\u653e\u5927\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u8ba4\u4e3a\u8fd9\u4e3b\u8981\u6e90\u4e8e\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u7684\u8bef\u5dee\u4f20\u64ad\uff0c\u800c\u975e\u6a21\u578b\u5bb9\u91cf\u4e0d\u8db3\uff0c\u5177\u4f53\u662f\u7531\u4e8e\u5728\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u91cd\u590d\u4f7f\u7528\u4e86\u5df2\u635f\u574f\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u6761\u4ef6\u6807\u8bb0\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u7b80\u5355\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u79fb\u9664\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u6807\u8bb0\u6765\u7f13\u89e3\u65f6\u95f4\u6f02\u79fb\u3002\u5c06\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6807\u8bb0\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e3a\u90a3\u4e9b\u4e0e\u5148\u524d\u751f\u6210\u6279\u6b21\u8868\u793a\u663e\u8457\u504f\u79bb\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u6807\u8bb0\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5b83\u4eec\u53ef\u80fd\u5df2\u635f\u574f\u6216\u53d1\u751f\u8bed\u4e49\u6f02\u79fb\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u4ece\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u4e2d\u663e\u5f0f\u79fb\u9664\u8fd9\u4e9b\u635f\u574f\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u6807\u8bb0\uff0c\u9632\u6b62\u4e0d\u53ef\u9760\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u4fe1\u606f\u5f71\u54cd\u672a\u6765\u7684\u751f\u6210\u6b65\u9aa4\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u6539\u5584\u4e86\u957f\u65f6\u57df\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u4e14\u65e0\u9700\u4fee\u6539\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u3001\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u6216\u79bb\u5f00\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u79fb\u9664\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u6807\u8bb0\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u7f13\u89e3\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u6f02\u79fb\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u63d0\u9ad8\u957f\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6a21\u578b\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e0d\u53d8\u3002"}}

Although transformer-based models have shown strong potential for HSIC, existing approaches often struggle to achieve sufficient spectral discriminability while maintaining computational efficiency. To address these limitations, we propose a novel DSXFormer, a novel dual-pooling spectral squeeze-expansion transformer with Dynamic Context Attention for HSIC. The proposed DSXFormer introduces a Dual-Pooling Spectral Squeeze-Expansion (DSX) block, which exploits complementary global average and max pooling to adaptively recalibrate spectral feature channels, thereby enhancing spectral discriminability and inter-band dependency modeling. In addition, DSXFormer incorporates a Dynamic Context Attention (DCA) mechanism within a window-based transformer architecture to dynamically capture local spectral-spatial relationships while significantly reducing computational overhead. The joint integration of spectral dual-pooling squeeze-expansion and DCA enables DSXFormer to achieve an effective balance between spectral emphasis and spatial contextual representation. Furthermore, patch extraction, embedding, and patch merging strategies are employed to facilitate efficient multi-scale feature learning. Extensive experiments conducted on four widely used hyperspectral benchmark datasets, including Salinas (SA), Indian Pines (IP), Pavia University (PU), and Kennedy Space Center (KSC), demonstrate that DSXFormer consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving classification accuracies of 99.95%, 98.91%, 99.85%, and 98.52%, respectively.", "AI": {"tldr": "DSXFormer\uff1a\u4e00\u79cd\u7528\u4e8e\u9ad8\u5149\u8c31\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u53cc\u6c60\u5316\u5149\u8c31\u6324\u538b-\u6269\u5c55\u53d8\u6362\u5668\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u52a8\u6001\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u5e73\u8861\u5149\u8c31\u533a\u5206\u6027\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387", "motivation": "\u9ad8\u5149\u8c31\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u9762\u4e34\u5149\u8c31\u7ef4\u5ea6\u9ad8\u3001\u5149\u8c31-\u7a7a\u95f4\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u590d\u6742\u3001\u6807\u8bb0\u8bad\u7ec3\u6837\u672c\u6709\u9650\u7b49\u6311\u6218\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8e\u53d8\u6362\u5668\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u96be\u4ee5\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u8db3\u591f\u7684\u5149\u8c31\u533a\u5206\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faDSXFormer\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u53cc\u6c60\u5316\u5149\u8c31\u6324\u538b-\u6269\u5c55\u5757\uff08\u5229\u7528\u5168\u5c40\u5e73\u5747\u548c\u6700\u5927\u6c60\u5316\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u91cd\u65b0\u6821\u51c6\u5149\u8c31\u7279\u5f81\u901a\u9053\uff09\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff08\u5728\u57fa\u4e8e\u7a97\u53e3\u7684\u53d8\u6362\u5668\u67b6\u6784\u4e2d\u52a8\u6001\u6355\u83b7\u5c40\u90e8\u5149\u8c31-\u7a7a\u95f4\u5173\u7cfb\uff09\u3002\u7ed3\u5408\u8865\u4e01\u63d0\u53d6\u3001\u5d4c\u5165\u548c\u5408\u5e76\u7b56\u7565\u5b9e\u73b0\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7279\u5f81\u5b66\u4e60\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u9ad8\u5149\u8c31\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08Salinas\u3001Indian Pines\u3001Pavia University\u3001Kennedy Space Center\uff09\u4e0a\u5206\u522b\u8fbe\u523099.95%\u300198.91%\u300199.85%\u300198.52%\u7684\u5206\u7c7b\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "DSXFormer\u901a\u8fc7\u5149\u8c31\u53cc\u6c60\u5316\u6324\u538b-\u6269\u5c55\u548c\u52a8\u6001\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7684\u8054\u5408\u96c6\u6210\uff0c\u5728\u5149\u8c31\u5f3a\u8c03\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u8868\u793a\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u5e73\u8861\uff0c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u5149\u8c31\u56fe\u50cf\u5206\u7c7b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u4e14\u6027\u80fd\u4f18\u8d8a\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

We found (1) single-domain generalization is highly asymmetric: training on other domains improves math reasoning by approximately 25\\% accuracy, while yielding negligible transfer to logic and puzzle; (2) cross-domain interactions are highly order-dependent: training in the order math$\\rightarrow$science achieves 83\\% / 41\\% accuracy on math / science, while reversing the order to science$\\rightarrow$math degrades performance to 77\\% / 25\\%; (3) no single strategy is universally optimal in multi-domain training: sequential training favors math (up to 84\\%), mixed training favors science and logic, and poor ordering can incur large performance gaps (from 70\\% to 56\\%). Overall, our findings demonstrate that GRPO under multi-domain settings exhibits pronounced asymmetry, order sensitivity, and strategy dependence, highlighting the necessity of domain-aware and order-aware training design.", "AI": {"tldr": "GRPO\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u9886\u57df\u6392\u5e8f\u7b56\u7565\u4e0b\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u5206\u6790\uff1a\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u5355\u9886\u57df\u6cdb\u5316\u5177\u6709\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\uff0c\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u4ea4\u4e92\u5177\u6709\u987a\u5e8f\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\uff0c\u591a\u9886\u57df\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u6ca1\u6709\u5355\u4e00\u6700\u4f18\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1GRPO\u5df2\u6210\u4e3a\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6280\u672f\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u5176\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u9886\u57df\u6392\u5e8f\u7b56\u7565\u4e0b\u7684\u884c\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002\u7279\u522b\u662f\u987a\u5e8f\u8bad\u7ec3\uff08\u4e00\u6b21\u4e00\u4e2a\u9886\u57df\uff09\u4e0e\u6df7\u5408\u9886\u57df\u8bad\u7ec3\uff08\u591a\u4e2a\u9886\u57df\u540c\u65f6\u8fdb\u884c\uff09\u5728GRPO\u4e2d\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u5c1a\u672a\u5f97\u5230\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u3002", "method": "\u5bf9\u6570\u5b66\u3001\u79d1\u5b66\u3001\u903b\u8f91\u548c\u8c1c\u9898\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u8fdb\u884c\u8bad\u7ec3\u987a\u5e8f\u6548\u5e94\u7684\u9996\u6b21\u7cfb\u7edf\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u987a\u5e8f\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0e\u6df7\u5408\u9886\u57df\u8bad\u7ec3\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u53d1\u73b0\u4e09\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u7ed3\u679c\uff1a1\uff09\u5355\u9886\u57df\u6cdb\u5316\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\uff1a\u5728\u5176\u4ed6\u9886\u57df\u8bad\u7ec3\u53ef\u63d0\u5347\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u7ea625%\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u903b\u8f91\u548c\u8c1c\u9898\u63a8\u7406\u51e0\u4e4e\u6ca1\u6709\u8fc1\u79fb\u6548\u679c\uff1b2\uff09\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u4ea4\u4e92\u9ad8\u5ea6\u4f9d\u8d56\u987a\u5e8f\uff1a\u6570\u5b66\u2192\u79d1\u5b66\u987a\u5e8f\u8bad\u7ec3\u5728\u6570\u5b66/\u79d1\u5b66\u4e0a\u8fbe\u523083%/41%\u51c6\u786e\u7387\uff0c\u800c\u79d1\u5b66\u2192\u6570\u5b66\u987a\u5e8f\u5219\u964d\u81f377%/25%\uff1b3\uff09\u591a\u9886\u57df\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u6ca1\u6709\u5355\u4e00\u6700\u4f18\u7b56\u7565\uff1a\u987a\u5e8f\u8bad\u7ec3\u6709\u5229\u4e8e\u6570\u5b66\uff08\u8fbe84%\uff09\uff0c\u6df7\u5408\u8bad\u7ec3\u6709\u5229\u4e8e\u79d1\u5b66\u548c\u903b\u8f91\uff0c\u4e0d\u826f\u6392\u5e8f\u53ef\u80fd\u5bfc\u81f4\u8f83\u5927\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u8ddd\uff08\u4ece70%\u964d\u81f356%\uff09\u3002", "conclusion": "GRPO\u5728\u591a\u9886\u57df\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u663e\u8457\u7684\u4e0d\u5bf9\u79f0\u6027\u3001\u987a\u5e8f\u654f\u611f\u6027\u548c\u7b56\u7565\u4f9d\u8d56\u6027\uff0c\u7a81\u663e\u4e86\u9886\u57df\u611f\u77e5\u548c\u987a\u5e8f\u611f\u77e5\u8bad\u7ec3\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u5fc5\u8981\u6027\u3002"}}

Deep learning has revolutionized this field with unprecedented predictive capabilities but faces a fundamental trade-off between performance and interpretability. While neural networks achieve high accuracy, their black-box nature limits clinical adoption. Conversely, deep clustering-based methods that stratify patients into interpretable risk groups typically sacrifice predictive power. We propose CONVERSE (CONtrastive Variational Ensemble for Risk Stratification and Estimation), a deep survival model that bridges this gap by unifying variational autoencoders with contrastive learning for interpretable risk stratification. CONVERSE combines variational embeddings with multiple intra- and inter-cluster contrastive losses. Self-paced learning progressively incorporates samples from easy to hard, improving training stability. The model supports cluster-specific survival heads, enabling accurate ensemble predictions.

Yet, while Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) master static semantics, their grasp of temporal dynamics remains brittle. We present TimeBlind, a diagnostic benchmark for compositional spatio-temporal understanding. Inspired by cognitive science, TimeBlind categorizes fine-grained temporal understanding into three levels: recognizing atomic events, characterizing event properties, and reasoning about event interdependencies. Unlike benchmarks that conflate recognition with temporal reasoning, TimeBlind leverages a minimal-pairs paradigm: video pairs share identical static visual content but differ solely in temporal structure, utilizing complementary questions to neutralize language priors. Evaluating over 20 state-of-the-art MLLMs (e.g., GPT-5, Gemini 3 Pro) on 600 curated instances (2400 video-question pairs), reveals that the Instance Accuracy (correctly distinguishing both videos in a pair) of the best performing MLLM is only 48.2%, far below the human performance (98.2%). These results demonstrate that even frontier models rely heavily on static visual shortcuts rather than genuine temporal logic, positioning TimeBlind as a vital diagnostic tool for next-generation video understanding.

Current mixed-precision training approaches either apply uniform precision to all GEMM operations or rely on heuristic-based methods that fail to generalize during training, leading to suboptimal convergence and instability. To address these challenges, this paper introduces SNIP, a fine-grained adaptive mixed-precision training framework for LLM pretraining that supports subbyte precision. SNIP periodically collects statistics on activations, gradients, and optimizer states to assess the precision loss impact on model quality. We define two key metrics: loss divergence in the forward pass, caused by quantization-induced increases in training loss, and weight divergence in the backward pass, which measures error propagation through gradients affecting model updates. These metrics guide an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) problem that systematically optimizes layerwise precision to minimize overall quality loss while meeting efficiency targets.

One major reason is the cross-image information leakage, where the model struggles to distinguish information across different images. Existing LVLMs already employ delimiter tokens to mark the start and end of each image, yet our analysis reveals that these tokens fail to effectively block cross-image information leakage. To enhance their effectiveness, we propose a method that scales the hidden states of delimiter tokens. This enhances the model's ability to preserve image-specific information by reinforcing intra-image interaction and limiting undesired cross-image interactions. Consequently, the model is better able to distinguish between images and reason over them more accurately.

However, attempting to achieve detailed control to get a desired image solely through text remains a laborious trial-and-error endeavor. Recent methods have introduced image-level controls alongside with text prompts, using prior images to extract conditional information such as edges, segmentation and depth maps. While effective, these methods apply conditions uniformly across the entire image, limiting localized control. In this paper, we propose a novel methodology to enable precise local control over user-defined regions of an image, while leaving to the diffusion model the task of autonomously generating the remaining areas according to the original prompt. Our approach introduces a new training framework that incorporates masking features and an additional loss term, which leverages the prediction of the initial latent vector at any diffusion step to enhance the correspondence between the current step and the final sample in the latent space. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method effectively synthesizes high-quality images with controlled local conditions.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u7528\u6237\u5b9a\u4e49\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u533a\u57df\u5b9e\u73b0\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u8ba9\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u6839\u636e\u539f\u59cb\u63d0\u793a\u81ea\u4e3b\u751f\u6210\u5176\u4f59\u533a\u57df\u3002", "motivation": "\u867d\u7136\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u9762\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\uff0c\u4f46\u4ec5\u901a\u8fc7\u6587\u672c\u5b9e\u73b0\u8be6\u7ec6\u63a7\u5236\u4ecd\u7136\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u7e41\u7410\u7684\u8bd5\u9519\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u867d\u7136\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u56fe\u50cf\u7ea7\u63a7\u5236\uff08\u5982\u8fb9\u7f18\u3001\u5206\u5272\u548c\u6df1\u5ea6\u56fe\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u4e9b\u63a7\u5236\u5728\u6574\u4e2a\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0a\u5747\u5300\u5e94\u7528\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u5c40\u90e8\u63a7\u5236\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u8bad\u7ec3\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u63a9\u7801\u7279\u5f81\u548c\u989d\u5916\u7684\u635f\u5931\u9879\u3002\u8be5\u635f\u5931\u9879\u5229\u7528\u5728\u4efb\u4f55\u6269\u6563\u6b65\u9aa4\u4e2d\u5bf9\u521d\u59cb\u6f5c\u5728\u5411\u91cf\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u6765\u589e\u5f3a\u5f53\u524d\u6b65\u9aa4\u4e0e\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u6700\u7ec8\u6837\u672c\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5bf9\u5e94\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "result": "\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5730\u5408\u6210\u5177\u6709\u53d7\u63a7\u5c40\u90e8\u6761\u4ef6\u7684\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u56fe\u50cf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3a\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u63a7\u5236\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6574\u4e2a\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0a\u5747\u5300\u5e94\u7528\u6761\u4ef6\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7528\u6237\u5b9a\u4e49\u533a\u57df\u7684\u7cbe\u786e\u63a7\u5236\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u81ea\u4e3b\u751f\u6210\u7684\u5e73\u8861\u3002"}}

Warner", "Danyal Maqbool", "Xin Tie", "Junjie Hu", "Meghan G. Lubner", "Tyler J. Bradshaw"], "title": "Opportunistic Promptable Segmentation: Leveraging Routine Radiological Annotations to Guide 3D CT Lesion Segmentation", "comment": null, "summary": "The development of machine learning models for CT imaging depends on the availability of large, high-quality, and diverse annotated datasets. Although large volumes of CT images and reports are readily available in clinical picture archiving and communication systems (PACS), 3D segmentations of critical findings are costly to obtain, typically requiring extensive manual annotation by radiologists. On the other hand, it is common for radiologists to provide limited annotations of findings during routine reads, such as line measurements and arrows, that are often stored in PACS as GSPS objects. We posit that these sparse annotations can be extracted along with CT volumes and converted into 3D segmentations using promptable segmentation models, a paradigm we term Opportunistic Promptable Segmentation. To enable this paradigm, we propose SAM2CT, the first promptable segmentation model designed to convert radiologist annotations into 3D segmentations in CT volumes. SAM2CT builds upon SAM2 by extending the prompt encoder to support arrow and line inputs and by introducing Memory-Conditioned Memories (MCM), a memory encoding strategy tailored to 3D medical volumes. On public lesion segmentation benchmarks, SAM2CT outperforms existing promptable segmentation models and similarly trained baselines, achieving Dice similarity coefficients of 0.649 for arrow prompts and 0.757 for line prompts. Applying the model to pre-existing GSPS annotations from a clinical PACS (N = 60), SAM2CT generates 3D segmentations that are clinically acceptable or require only minor adjustments in 87% of cases, as scored by radiologists. Additionally, SAM2CT demonstrates strong zero-shot performance on select Emergency Department findings.

Recent approaches leverage generalizable models to generate 3D scenes using 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) primitive. However, they often fail to produce continuous surfaces and instead yield discrete, color-biased point clouds that appear plausible at normal resolution but reveal severe artifacts under close-up views. To address this issue, we present SurfSplat, a feedforward framework based on 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) primitive, which provides stronger anisotropy and higher geometric precision. By incorporating a surface continuity prior and a forced alpha blending strategy, SurfSplat reconstructs coherent geometry together with faithful textures. Furthermore, we introduce High-Resolution Rendering Consistency (HRRC), a new evaluation metric designed to evaluate high-resolution reconstruction quality. Extensive experiments on RealEstate10K, DL3DV, and ScanNet demonstrate that SurfSplat consistently outperforms prior methods on both standard metrics and HRRC, establishing a robust solution for high-fidelity 3D reconstruction from sparse inputs.

Existing causal discovery methods typically operate on raw observations, making them vulnerable to spurious edges and misattributed temporal dependencies. We introduce a decomposition-based causal discovery framework that separates each time series into trend, seasonal, and residual components and performs component-specific causal analysis. Trend components are assessed using stationarity tests, seasonal components using kernel-based dependence measures, and residual components using constraint-based causal discovery. The resulting component-level graphs are integrated into a unified multi-scale causal structure. This approach isolates long- and short-range causal effects, reduces spurious associations, and improves interpretability.

However, existing methods predominantly concentrate on single-modality generation, typically focusing on either multi-camera video or LiDAR sequence synthesis. In this paper, we propose UniDriveDreamer, a single-stage unified multimodal world model for autonomous driving, which directly generates multimodal future observations without relying on intermediate representations or cascaded modules. Our framework introduces a LiDAR-specific variational autoencoder (VAE) designed to encode input LiDAR sequences, alongside a video VAE for multi-camera images. To ensure cross-modal compatibility and training stability, we propose Unified Latent Anchoring (ULA), which explicitly aligns the latent distributions of the two modalities.

Yet this capability also increases hallucinations, where the model generates content that is not supported by the input image or the question. To understand this failure mode, we identify \\emph{reasoning drift}: during clue gathering, the model over-focuses on question-irrelevant entities, diluting focus on task-relevant cues and gradually decoupling the reasoning trace from visual grounding. As a consequence, many inference-time localization or intervention methods developed for non-reasoning models fail to pinpoint the true clues in reasoning settings. Motivated by these insights, we introduce ClueRecall, a metric for assessing visual clue retrieval, and present ClueTracer, a training-free, parameter-free, and architecture-agnostic plugin for hallucination suppression. ClueTracer starts from the question and traces how key clues propagate along the model's reasoning pathway (question $\\rightarrow$ outputs $\\rightarrow$ visual tokens), thereby localizing task-relevant patches while suppressing spurious attention to irrelevant regions.

Disentangling the visual and linguistic roots of these failures is a fundamental challenge for robust evaluation. To enable fine-grained, controllable analysis, we introduce Auto-Comp, a fully automated and synthetic pipeline for generating scalable benchmarks. Its controllable nature is key to dissecting and isolating different reasoning skills. Auto-Comp generates paired images from Minimal (e.g., \"a monitor to the left of a bicycle on a white background\") and LLM-generated Contextual captions (e.g., \"In a brightly lit photography studio, a monitor is positioned to the left of a bicycle\"), allowing a controlled A/B test to disentangle core binding ability from visio-linguistic complexity. Our evaluation of 20 VLMs on novel benchmarks for color binding and spatial relations reveals universal compositional failures in both CLIP and SigLIP model families. Crucially, our novel \"Confusion Benchmark\" reveals a deeper flaw beyond simple attribute swaps: models are highly susceptible to low-entropy distractors (e.g., repeated objects or colors), demonstrating their compositional failures extend beyond known bag-of-words limitations. we uncover a surprising trade-off: visio-linguistic context, which provides global scene cues, aids spatial reasoning but simultaneously hinders local attribute binding by introducing visual clutter. We release the Auto-Comp pipeline to facilitate future benchmark creation, alongside all our generated benchmarks (https://huggingface.co/AutoComp).", "AI": {"tldr": "Auto-Comp\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u5408\u6210\u57fa\u51c6\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u8bc4\u4f30\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7ec4\u5408\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u7684\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u989c\u8272\u7ed1\u5b9a\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u5173\u7cfb\u7406\u89e3\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u5931\u8d25\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u4ee3\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7ec4\u5408\u63a8\u7406\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u5173\u952e\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u7ecf\u5e38\u6df7\u6dc6\"\u7ea2\u8272\u7acb\u65b9\u4f53\u548c\u84dd\u8272\u7403\u4f53\"\u4e0e\"\u84dd\u8272\u7acb\u65b9\u4f53\u548c\u7ea2\u8272\u7403\u4f53\"\u3002\u9700\u8981\u53ef\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u8bc4\u4f30\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u5206\u79bb\u89c6\u89c9\u548c\u8bed\u8a00\u6839\u6e90\u7684\u5931\u8d25\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165Auto-Comp\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u5b8c\u5168\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u548c\u5408\u6210\u7684\u7ba1\u9053\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u751f\u6210\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u751f\u6210\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u63cf\u8ff0\u548cLLM\u751f\u6210\u7684\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u63cf\u8ff0\u914d\u5bf9\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u8fdb\u884c\u53d7\u63a7\u7684A/B\u6d4b\u8bd5\uff0c\u5206\u79bb\u6838\u5fc3\u7ed1\u5b9a\u80fd\u529b\u4e0e\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u590d\u6742\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u572820\u4e2aVLM\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\u989c\u8272\u7ed1\u5b9a\u548c\u7a7a\u95f4\u5173\u7cfb\u7684\u65b0\u57fa\u51c6\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86CLIP\u548cSigLIP\u6a21\u578b\u5bb6\u65cf\u666e\u904d\u7684\u7ec4\u5408\u63a8\u7406\u5931\u8d25\u3002\u53d1\u73b0\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u4f4e\u71b5\u5e72\u6270\u7269\u9ad8\u5ea6\u654f\u611f\uff0c\u4e14\u5b58\u5728\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5728\u5e2e\u52a9\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u963b\u788d\u5c40\u90e8\u5c5e\u6027\u7ed1\u5b9a\u7684\u6743\u8861\u3002", "conclusion": "\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5b58\u5728\u6df1\u5c42\u7684\u7ec4\u5408\u63a8\u7406\u7f3a\u9677\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u5df2\u77e5\u7684\u8bcd\u888b\u9650\u5236\u3002Auto-Comp\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u672a\u6765\u57fa\u51c6\u521b\u5efa\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5de5\u5177\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7ec4\u5408\u7406\u89e3\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u5f31\u70b9\u3002"}}

Although numerous deep-learning models have been proposed for stenosis detection from a single angiography view, their performance heavily relies on expensive view-level annotations, which are often not readily available in hospital systems. Moreover, these models fail to capture the temporal dynamics and dependencies among multiple views, which are crucial for clinical diagnosis. To address this, we propose SegmentMIL, a transformer-based multi-view multiple-instance learning framework for patient-level stenosis classification. Trained on a real-world clinical dataset, using patient-level supervision and without any view-level annotations, SegmentMIL jointly predicts the presence of stenosis and localizes the affected anatomical region, distinguishing between the right and left coronary arteries and their respective segments. SegmentMIL obtains high performance on internal and external evaluations and outperforms both view-level models and classical MIL baselines, underscoring its potential as a clinically viable and scalable solution for coronary stenosis diagnosis.

To address these issues, we present UrbanGS, a scalable reconstruction framework that effectively tackles these challenges for city-scale applications. First, we propose a Depth-Consistent D-Normal Regularization module. Unlike existing approaches that rely solely on monocular normal estimators, which can effectively update rotation parameters yet struggle to update position parameters, our method integrates D-Normal constraints with external depth supervision. This allows for comprehensive updates of all geometric parameters. By further incorporating an adaptive confidence weighting mechanism based on gradient consistency and inverse depth deviation, our approach significantly enhances multi-view depth alignment and geometric coherence, which effectively resolves the issue of geometric accuracy in complex large-scale scenes. To improve scalability, we introduce a Spatially Adaptive Gaussian Pruning (SAGP) strategy, which dynamically adjusts Gaussian density based on local geometric complexity and visibility to reduce redundancy. Additionally, a unified partitioning and view assignment scheme is designed to eliminate boundary artifacts and optimize computational load. Extensive experiments on multiple urban datasets demonstrate that UrbanGS achieves superior performance in rendering quality, geometric accuracy, and memory efficiency, providing a systematic solution for high-fidelity large-scale scene reconstruction.", "AI": {"tldr": "UrbanGS\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u9488\u5bf9\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u57ce\u5e02\u573a\u666f\u76843D\u9ad8\u65af\u6cfc\u6e85\u6269\u5c55\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6df1\u5ea6\u4e00\u81f4\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u9ad8\u65af\u526a\u679d\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u51e0\u4f55\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3001\u5185\u5b58\u6548\u7387\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u7b49\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\u3002", "motivation": "3D\u9ad8\u65af\u6cfc\u6e85\uff083DGS\uff09\u5728\u6709\u9650\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u80fd\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u5b9e\u65f6\u6e32\u67d3\uff0c\u4f46\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u57ce\u5e02\u573a\u666f\u65f6\u9762\u4e34\u51e0\u4f55\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3001\u5185\u5b58\u6548\u7387\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u7b49\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "1. \u6df1\u5ea6\u4e00\u81f4D-Normal\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u6a21\u5757\uff1a\u7ed3\u5408D-Normal\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0e\u5916\u90e8\u6df1\u5ea6\u76d1\u7763\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u57fa\u4e8e\u68af\u5ea6\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u548c\u9006\u6df1\u5ea6\u504f\u5dee\u7684\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u52a0\u6743\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5168\u9762\u66f4\u65b0\u51e0\u4f55\u53c2\u6570\uff1b2. \u7a7a\u95f4\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u9ad8\u65af\u526a\u679d\u7b56\u7565\uff1a\u6839\u636e\u5c40\u90e8\u51e0\u4f55\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u548c\u53ef\u89c1\u6027\u52a8\u6001\u8c03\u6574\u9ad8\u65af\u5bc6\u5ea6\uff1b3. \u7edf\u4e00\u5206\u533a\u548c\u89c6\u56fe\u5206\u914d\u65b9\u6848\uff1a\u6d88\u9664\u8fb9\u754c\u4f2a\u5f71\u5e76\u4f18\u5316\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d1f\u8f7d\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57ce\u5e02\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cUrbanGS\u5728\u6e32\u67d3\u8d28\u91cf\u3001\u51e0\u4f55\u7cbe\u5ea6\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u6548\u7387\u65b9\u9762\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u573a\u666f\u91cd\u5efa\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7cfb\u7edf\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "conclusion": "UrbanGS\u901a\u8fc7\u521b\u65b0\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u4e00\u81f4\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u548c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u526a\u679d\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e863DGS\u5728\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u57ce\u5e02\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3001\u5185\u5b58\u6548\u7387\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u4e3a\u57ce\u5e02\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u91cd\u5efa\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

We discuss our model design as well as training strategies in this report.", "AI": {"tldr": "FSVideo\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8eTransformer\u7684\u5feb\u901f\u56fe\u50cf\u5230\u89c6\u9891\u6269\u6563\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u9ad8\u5ea6\u538b\u7f29\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u3001\u5e26\u5185\u5b58\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u6269\u6563Transformer\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u591a\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u751f\u6210\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\u7684\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f00\u53d1\u4e00\u4e2a\u5feb\u901f\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u5230\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u5927\u5e45\u63d0\u5347\u751f\u6210\u901f\u5ea6\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u6a21\u578b\u901f\u5ea6\u8f83\u6162\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "1) \u8bbe\u8ba1\u65b0\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b064\u00d764\u00d74\u7684\u9ad8\u538b\u7f29\u7a7a\u95f4-\u65f6\u95f4\u4e0b\u91c7\u6837\u6bd4\uff1b2) \u91c7\u7528\u5e26\u5c42\u5185\u5b58\u8bbe\u8ba1\u7684\u6269\u6563Transformer\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u589e\u5f3a\u5c42\u95f4\u4fe1\u606f\u6d41\u548c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u91cd\u7528\uff1b3) \u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u751f\u6210\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5c11\u91cf\u6b65\u9aa4\u7684DIT\u4e0a\u91c7\u6837\u5668\u63d0\u9ad8\u89c6\u9891\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u3002", "result": "\u6700\u7ec8\u6a21\u578b\u5305\u542b140\u4ebf\u53c2\u6570\u7684DIT\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u548c140\u4ebf\u53c2\u6570\u7684DIT\u4e0a\u91c7\u6837\u5668\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u4e0e\u5176\u4ed6\u6d41\u884c\u5f00\u6e90\u6a21\u578b\u7ade\u4e89\u529b\u7684\u540c\u65f6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6570\u91cf\u7ea7\u7684\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u5347\u3002", "conclusion": "FSVideo\u6846\u67b6\u901a\u8fc7\u521b\u65b0\u7684\u89c6\u9891\u81ea\u7f16\u7801\u5668\u3001\u6269\u6563Transformer\u67b6\u6784\u548c\u591a\u5206\u8fa8\u7387\u751f\u6210\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5feb\u901f\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u5230\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u89c6\u9891\u751f\u6210\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

Instead of the direct teacher-student alignment, we leverage the teacher classifier to guide the sampling process of denoising student features through a light-weight diffusion model. We then propose a novel locality-sensitive hashing (LSH)-guided feature distillation method between the original and denoised student features. The denoised student features encapsulate teacher knowledge and could be regarded as a teacher role. In this way, our DSKD method could eliminate discrepancies in mapping manners and feature distributions between the teacher and student, while learning meaningful knowledge from the teacher.

However, these defenses often focus on analyzing explicit textual inputs or relevant visual scenes. In this work, we introduce Text-DJ, a novel jailbreak attack that bypasses these safeguards by exploiting the model's Optical Character Recognition (OCR) capability. Our methodology consists of three stages. First, we decompose a single harmful query into multiple and semantically related but more benign sub-queries. Second, we pick a set of distraction queries that are maximally irrelevant to the harmful query. Third, we present all decomposed sub-queries and distraction queries to the LVLM simultaneously as a grid of images, with the position of the sub-queries being middle within the grid. We demonstrate that this method successfully circumvents the safety alignment of state-of-the-art LVLMs. We argue this attack succeeds by (1) converting text-based prompts into images, bypassing standard text-based filters, and (2) inducing distractions, where the model's safety protocols fail to link the scattered sub-queries within a high number of irrelevant queries. Overall, our findings expose a critical vulnerability in LVLMs' OCR capabilities that are not robust to dispersed, multi-image adversarial inputs, highlighting the need for defenses for fragmented multimodal inputs.", "AI": {"tldr": "Text-DJ\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9488\u5bf9\u5927\u578b\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u8d8a\u72f1\u653b\u51fb\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u6709\u5bb3\u67e5\u8be2\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u591a\u4e2a\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u5173\u4f46\u66f4\u826f\u6027\u7684\u5b50\u67e5\u8be2\uff0c\u5e76\u52a0\u5165\u5927\u91cf\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u5e72\u6270\u67e5\u8be2\uff0c\u4ee5\u56fe\u50cf\u7f51\u683c\u5f62\u5f0f\u540c\u65f6\u5448\u73b0\uff0c\u6210\u529f\u7ed5\u8fc7\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u9632\u62a4\u673a\u5236\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u5e38\u5177\u6709\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u9632\u62a4\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u4f46\u8fd9\u4e9b\u9632\u5fa1\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u663e\u5f0f\u6587\u672c\u8f93\u5165\u6216\u76f8\u5173\u89c6\u89c9\u573a\u666f\u7684\u5206\u6790\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8005\u53d1\u73b0\u53ef\u4ee5\u5229\u7528\u6a21\u578b\u7684OCR\u80fd\u529b\u7ed5\u8fc7\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5b89\u5168\u9632\u62a4\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5206\u6563\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8f93\u5165\u65b9\u9762\u7684\u8106\u5f31\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u65b9\u6cd5\u5206\u4e3a\u4e09\u4e2a\u9636\u6bb5\uff1a1) \u5c06\u5355\u4e2a\u6709\u5bb3\u67e5\u8be2\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u591a\u4e2a\u8bed\u4e49\u76f8\u5173\u4f46\u66f4\u826f\u6027\u7684\u5b50\u67e5\u8be2\uff1b2) \u9009\u62e9\u4e0e\u6709\u5bb3\u67e5\u8be2\u6700\u5927\u7a0b\u5ea6\u65e0\u5173\u7684\u5e72\u6270\u67e5\u8be2\u96c6\u5408\uff1b3) \u5c06\u6240\u6709\u5206\u89e3\u7684\u5b50\u67e5\u8be2\u548c\u5e72\u6270\u67e5\u8be2\u4ee5\u56fe\u50cf\u7f51\u683c\u5f62\u5f0f\u540c\u65f6\u5448\u73b0\u7ed9\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\u5b50\u67e5\u8be2\u4f4d\u4e8e\u7f51\u683c\u4e2d\u95f4\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3002", "result": "\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u6210\u529f\u7ed5\u8fc7\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u5927\u578b\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u5bf9\u9f50\u673a\u5236\u3002\u653b\u51fb\u6210\u529f\u7684\u539f\u56e0\u5305\u62ec\uff1a1) \u5c06\u57fa\u4e8e\u6587\u672c\u7684\u63d0\u793a\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u7ed5\u8fc7\u6807\u51c6\u6587\u672c\u8fc7\u6ee4\u5668\uff1b2) \u5f15\u5165\u5e72\u6270\uff0c\u4f7f\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u534f\u8bae\u65e0\u6cd5\u5728\u5927\u91cf\u65e0\u5173\u67e5\u8be2\u4e2d\u94fe\u63a5\u5206\u6563\u7684\u5b50\u67e5\u8be2\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7814\u7a76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5927\u578b\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578bOCR\u80fd\u529b\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6f0f\u6d1e\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u5206\u6563\u7684\u591a\u56fe\u50cf\u5bf9\u6297\u6027\u8f93\u5165\u4e0d\u591f\u9c81\u68d2\uff0c\u7a81\u663e\u4e86\u9700\u8981\u4e3a\u788e\u7247\u5316\u7684\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u8f93\u5165\u5f00\u53d1\u9632\u5fa1\u673a\u5236\u7684\u5fc5\u8981\u6027\u3002"}}

Detecting adverse effects at an early stage is critical to reduce attrition and accelerate the development of safe medicines. Histopathological evaluation remains the gold standard for toxicity assessment, but it relies heavily on expert pathologists, creating a bottleneck for large-scale screening. To address this challenge, we introduce an AI-based anomaly detection framework for histopathological whole-slide images (WSIs) in rodent livers from toxicology studies. The system identifies healthy tissue and known pathologies (anomalies) for which training data is available. In addition, it can detect rare pathologies without training data as out-of-distribution (OOD) findings. We generate a novel dataset of pixelwise annotations of healthy tissue and known pathologies and use this data to fine-tune a pre-trained Vision Transformer (DINOv2) via Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) in order to do tissue segmentation. Finally, we extract features for OOD detection using the Mahalanobis distance. To better account for class-dependent variability in histological data, we propose the use of class-specific thresholds.

Intriguingly, this mapping can be as simple as a shallow MLP transformation. To understand why LLMs can so readily process visual tokens, we need interpretability methods that reveal what is encoded in the visual token representations at every layer of LLM processing. In this work, we introduce LatentLens, a novel approach for mapping latent representations to descriptions in natural language. LatentLens works by encoding a large text corpus and storing contextualized token representations for each token in that corpus. Visual token representations are then compared to their contextualized textual representations, with the top-k nearest neighbor representations providing descriptions of the visual token. We evaluate this method on 10 different VLMs, showing that commonly used methods, such as LogitLens, substantially underestimate the interpretability of visual tokens.

Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in code generation, symbolic reasoning, and tool use, but reliably solving PDEs across heterogeneous settings remains challenging. Prior work on LLM-based code generation and transformer-based foundation models for PDE learning has shown promising advances. However, a persistent trade-off between execution success rate and numerical accuracy arises, particularly when generalization to unseen parameters and boundary conditions is required. In this work, we propose OpInf-LLM, an LLM parametric PDE solving framework based on operator inference. The proposed framework leverages a small amount of solution data to enable accurate prediction of diverse PDE instances, including unseen parameters and configurations, and provides seamless integration with LLMs for natural language specification of PDE solving tasks. Its low computational demands and unified tool interface further enable a high execution success rate across heterogeneous settings.

However, overfitting remains a challenge that limits its broader applicability. To improve generalization, we prove that vicinal risk, estimated through noise perturbation or mixup-based data augmentation, is bounded by the sum of empirical risk and a regularization term-either finite difference or the vicinal Jensen gap. Leveraging this decomposition, we propose an evolutionary feature construction framework that jointly optimizes empirical risk and the vicinal Jensen gap to control overfitting. Since datasets may vary in noise levels, we develop a noise estimation strategy to dynamically adjust regularization strength. Furthermore, to mitigate manifold intrusion-where data augmentation may generate unrealistic samples that fall outside the data manifold-we propose a manifold intrusion detection mechanism. Experimental results on 58 datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of Jensen gap minimization compared to other complexity measures.

It comprises two branches, image-based and text-based weakly-supervised localization. For the former, we devise the Textual-guidance Refine Patch Selection (TRPS) module. It integrates forgery cues from both visual and textual perspectives to lock onto suspicious regions aided by spatial priors. Followed by the background silencing and spatial contrast constraints to suppress interference from irrelevant areas. For the latter, we devise the Visual-deviation Calibrated Token Grounding (VCTG) module. It focuses on meaningful content words and leverages relative visual bias to assist token localization.

However, evaluating these visual and textual search abilities is still difficult, and existing benchmarks have two major limitations. First, existing benchmarks are not visual search-centric: answers that should require visual search are often leaked through cross-textual cues in the text questions or can be inferred from the prior world knowledge in current MLLMs. Second, overly idealized evaluation scenario: On the image-search side, the required information can often be obtained via near-exact matching against the full image, while the text-search side is overly direct and insufficiently challenging. To address these issues, we construct the Vision-DeepResearch benchmark (VDR-Bench) comprising 2,000 VQA instances. All questions are created via a careful, multi-stage curation pipeline and rigorous expert review, designed to assess the behavior of Vision-DeepResearch systems under realistic real-world conditions. Moreover, to address the insufficient visual retrieval capabilities of current MLLMs, we propose a simple multi-round cropped-search workflow.

We develop a framework clearly separating the underlying world, the data generation process and the resulting model representations to study these questions in a controlled setup. 5,075 city coordinates define the world and 7 geometric tasks generate the training data for autoregressive training. We find that different tasks give rise to qualitatively and quantitatively distinct world representation geometries. However, multi-task training drives convergence of world representations: models trained on non-overlapping tasks develop aligned geometric representations, providing controlled evidence for the Multitask Scaling Hypothesis of the Platonic Representation Hypothesis. To study adaptation, we pretrain models on all tasks, then test whether new entities (cities) can be consistently integrated into the representation space via fine-tuning. Surprisingly, we find that despite multi-task pretraining, some tasks, which we call divergent, actively harm the representational integration of new entities and harm generalization. Our results show that training on multiple relational tasks reliably produces convergent world representations, but lurking divergent tasks can catastrophically harm new entity integration via fine-tuning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u8bad\u7ec3\u80fd\u4fc3\u8fdb\u4e16\u754c\u8868\u5f81\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u4f46\u67d0\u4e9b\"\u53d1\u6563\u6027\u4efb\u52a1\"\u4f1a\u635f\u5bb3\u65b0\u5b9e\u4f53\u7684\u8868\u5f81\u6574\u5408\u80fd\u529b", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76\u795e\u7ecf\u8868\u5f81\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u7279\u6027\u53ca\u5176\u5728\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u9002\u5e94\u6027\u7684\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u76ee\u524d\u5bf9\u8fd9\u4e9b\u6761\u4ef6\u7406\u89e3\u4e0d\u8db3", "method": "\u5efa\u7acb\u5206\u79bb\u4e16\u754c\u3001\u6570\u636e\u751f\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u548c\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u5f81\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f7f\u75285,075\u4e2a\u57ce\u5e02\u5750\u6807\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e16\u754c\uff0c7\u4e2a\u51e0\u4f55\u4efb\u52a1\u751f\u6210\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u8bad\u7ec3\u6570\u636e\uff0c\u7814\u7a76\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u5fae\u8c03", "result": "\u4e0d\u540c\u4efb\u52a1\u4ea7\u751f\u4e0d\u540c\u7684\u4e16\u754c\u8868\u5f81\u51e0\u4f55\uff1b\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u8bad\u7ec3\u4fc3\u8fdb\u8868\u5f81\u5bf9\u9f50\uff1b\u4f46\u67d0\u4e9b\u53d1\u6563\u6027\u4efb\u52a1\u4f1a\u635f\u5bb3\u65b0\u5b9e\u4f53\u7684\u8868\u5f81\u6574\u5408\u548c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b", "conclusion": "\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\u8bad\u7ec3\u80fd\u53ef\u9760\u4ea7\u751f\u6536\u655b\u7684\u4e16\u754c\u8868\u5f81\uff0c\u4f46\u53d1\u6563\u6027\u4efb\u52a1\u53ef\u80fd\u901a\u8fc7\u5fae\u8c03\u707e\u96be\u6027\u5730\u635f\u5bb3\u65b0\u5b9e\u4f53\u7684\u6574\u5408"}}

To address this issue, we propose native PIC by reintroducing the encoder to prevalent decoder-only LLMs and explicitly training it to support PIC.

Current approaches typically rely on dense volumetric processing or explicit graph reasoning, leading to limited efficiency and reduced robustness under realistic structural corruption. We propose TopoField, a topology-aware implicit modeling framework that treats topology repair as a first-class modeling problem and enables unified multi-task inference for pulmonary tree analysis. TopoField represents pulmonary anatomy using sparse surface and skeleton point clouds and learns a continuous implicit field that supports topology repair without relying on complete or explicit disconnection annotations, by training on synthetically introduced structural disruptions over \\textit{already} incomplete trees. Building upon the repaired implicit representation, anatomical labeling and lung segment reconstruction are jointly inferred through task-specific implicit functions within a single forward pass.Extensive experiments on the Lung3D+ dataset demonstrate that TopoField consistently improves topological completeness and achieves accurate anatomical labeling and lung segment reconstruction under challenging incomplete scenarios. Owing to its implicit formulation, TopoField attains high computational efficiency, completing all tasks in just over one second per case, highlighting its practicality for large-scale and time-sensitive clinical applications.

Existing deep learning approaches often treat spectral matching as a closed-set recognition task, limiting their ability to generalize to unseen molecular scaffolds. To overcome this limitation, we propose a cross-modal alignment framework that directly maps mass spectra into the chemically meaningful molecular structure embedding space of a pretrained chemical language model. On a strict scaffold-disjoint benchmark, our model achieves a Top-1 accuracy of 42.2% in fixed 256-way zero-shot retrieval and demonstrates strong generalization under a global retrieval setting. Moreover, the learned embedding space demonstrates strong chemical coherence, reaching 95.4% accuracy in 5-way 5-shot molecular re-identification.

We propose a \\emph{relative-budget} theory explaining this variation through a single quantity called relative budget $\u03be:= H/\\mathbb{E}[T]$, where $H$ is the generation horizon (token budget) and $T$ denotes the number of tokens until the first correct solution under a base policy. We show that $\u03be$ determines sample efficiency by controlling reward variance and the likelihood of informative trajectories. Our analysis reveals three regimes: in the \\emph{deficient} regime ($\u03be\\to 0$), informative trajectories are rare and the sample complexity explodes; in the \\emph{balanced} regime ($\u03be=\u0398(1)$), informative trajectories occur with non-negligible probability and RL is maximally sample-efficient; and in the \\emph{ample} regime ($\u03be\\to \\infty$), learning remains stable but marginal gains per iteration diminish.

Specifically, our Intention Abstraction (IA) extracts verbose linguistic instructions and their associated reasoning into compact, explicit semantic primitives, while the Environment Semantics Abstraction (ESA) projects overwhelming visual streams into a structured, topological affordance representation. Furthermore, aligning these two abstract modalities induces an emergent attention-concentration effect, enabling a parameter-free token-pruning strategy that filters out perceptual redundancy without degrading performance.

However, existing approaches do not bridge this gap theoretically. They initialize the AR student via ODE distillation, which requires frame-level injectivity, where each noisy frame must map to a unique clean frame under the PF-ODE of an AR teacher. Distilling an AR student from a bidirectional teacher violates this condition, preventing recovery of the teacher's flow map and instead inducing a conditional-expectation solution, which degrades performance. To address this issue, we propose Causal Forcing that uses an AR teacher for ODE initialization, thereby bridging the architectural gap. Empirical results show that our method outperforms all baselines across all metrics, surpassing the SOTA Self Forcing by 19.3\\% in Dynamic Degree, 8.7\\% in VisionReward, and 16.7\\% in Instruction Following.

While Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are the standard solution, state-of-the-art pipelines often rely on explicit structural heuristics or memory-intensive node embeddings -- approaches that struggle to generalize or scale to massive graphs. Emerging Graph Transformers (GTs) offer a potential alternative but often incur significant overhead due to complex structural encodings, hindering their applications to large-scale link prediction. We challenge these sophisticated paradigms with PENCIL, an encoder-only plain Transformer that replaces hand-crafted priors with attention over sampled local subgraphs, retaining the scalability and hardware efficiency of standard Transformers. Through experimental and theoretical analysis, we show that PENCIL extracts richer structural signals than GNNs, implicitly generalizing a broad class of heuristics and subgraph-based expressivity. Empirically, PENCIL outperforms heuristic-informed GNNs and is far more parameter-efficient than ID-embedding--based alternatives, while remaining competitive across diverse benchmarks -- even without node features.

We introduce HieraNav, a multi-granularity, open-vocabulary goal navigation task where agents interpret natural language instructions to reach targets at four semantic levels: scene, room, region, and instance. To this end, we present Language as a Map (LangMap), a large-scale benchmark built on real-world 3D indoor scans with comprehensive human-verified annotations and tasks spanning these levels. LangMap provides region labels, discriminative region descriptions, discriminative instance descriptions covering 414 object categories, and over 18K navigation tasks. Each target features both concise and detailed descriptions, enabling evaluation across different instruction styles. LangMap achieves superior annotation quality, outperforming GOAT-Bench by 23.8% in discriminative accuracy using four times fewer words. Comprehensive evaluations of zero-shot and supervised models on LangMap reveal that richer context and memory improve success, while long-tailed, small, context-dependent, and distant goals, as well as multi-goal completion, remain challenging. HieraNav and LangMap establish a rigorous testbed for advancing language-driven embodied navigation.

However, this practice violates the training-free premise of zero-shot deployment and introduces evaluation bias due to classifier-dependent training choices. To address this issue, we propose TIC-FM, an in-context learning framework that treats the labeled training set as context and predicts labels for all test instances in a single forward pass, without parameter updates.

However, existing shared-token designs are mostly architecture-driven and lack an explicit criterion for what information tokens should preserve to support both understanding and generation. Therefore, we introduce a capacity-constrained perspective, highlighting that in shared-token unified MLLMs the visual tokenizer behaves as a compute-bounded learner, so the token budget should prioritize reusable structure over hard-to-exploit high-entropy variations and redundancy. Motivated by this perspective, we propose InfoTok, an information-regularized visual tokenization mechanism grounded in the Information Bottleneck (IB) principle. InfoTok formulates tokenization as controlling information flow from images to shared tokens to multimodal outputs, yielding a principled trade-off between compression and task relevance via mutual-information regularization. We integrate InfoTok into three representative unified MLLMs without introducing any additional training data.

Across eight instruction-tuned transformer models, we run two experimental paradigms -- similarity-based forced choice and free association -- over a shared 5,000-word vocabulary, collecting 17.5M+ trials to build behavior-based similarity matrices. Using representational similarity analysis, we compare behavioral geometries to layerwise hidden-state similarity and benchmark against FastText, BERT, and cross-model consensus. We find that forced-choice behavior aligns substantially more with hidden-state geometry than free association. In a held-out-words regression, behavioral similarity (especially forced choice) predicts unseen hidden-state similarities beyond lexical baselines and cross-model consensus, indicating that behavior-only measurements retain recoverable information about internal semantic geometry.

Although the associated mean-field objective admits a unique mixed Nash equilibrium, the long-time behavior of the original MFL-DA for general nonconvex-nonconcave payoffs has remained largely open. Answering an open question posed by Wang and Chizat (COLT 2024), we provide a partial resolution by proving that this equilibrium is locally exponentially stable: if the initialization is sufficiently close in Wasserstein metric, the dynamics trends to the equilibrium at an exponential rate. The key to our analysis is to establish a coercivity estimate for the entropy near equilibrium via spectral analysis of the linearized operator. We show that this coercivity effectively reveals a local displacement convex-concave structure, thereby driving contraction. This result settles the local stability and quantitative rate questions of Wang and Chizat, leaving global convergence as a remaining open challenge.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86MFL-DA\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u5728\u71b5\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u4e8c\u4eba\u96f6\u548c\u535a\u5f08\u4e2d\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u6307\u6570\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\uff1a\u5f53\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u8db3\u591f\u63a5\u8fd1\u6df7\u5408\u7eb3\u4ec0\u5747\u8861\u65f6\uff0c\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u4ee5\u6307\u6570\u901f\u7387\u6536\u655b\u5230\u5747\u8861\u70b9\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5747\u503c\u573a\u76ee\u6807\u51fd\u6570\u5b58\u5728\u552f\u4e00\u7684\u6df7\u5408\u7eb3\u4ec0\u5747\u8861\uff0c\u4f46\u5bf9\u4e8e\u4e00\u822c\u975e\u51f8\u975e\u51f9\u6536\u76ca\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u539f\u59cbMFL-DA\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u7684\u957f\u671f\u884c\u4e3a\u4ecd\u4e0d\u6e05\u695a\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u56de\u7b54Wang\u548cChizat\u5728COLT 2024\u4e2d\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u5173\u4e8e\u5c40\u90e8\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u5b9a\u91cf\u6536\u655b\u901f\u7387\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u8c31\u5206\u6790\u7ebf\u6027\u5316\u7b97\u5b50\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u71b5\u5728\u5747\u8861\u70b9\u9644\u8fd1\u7684\u5f3a\u5236\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\u3002\u8be5\u5f3a\u5236\u6027\u4f30\u8ba1\u6709\u6548\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5c40\u90e8\u4f4d\u79fb\u51f8\u51f9\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u9a71\u52a8\u6536\u7f29\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5747\u8861\u70b9\u662f\u5c40\u90e8\u6307\u6570\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\uff1a\u5982\u679c\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u5728Wasserstein\u5ea6\u91cf\u4e0b\u8db3\u591f\u63a5\u8fd1\u5747\u8861\u70b9\uff0c\u52a8\u529b\u5b66\u5c06\u4ee5\u6307\u6570\u901f\u7387\u8d8b\u5411\u5747\u8861\u70b9\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7ed3\u679c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86Wang\u548cChizat\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u5c40\u90e8\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u548c\u5b9a\u91cf\u901f\u7387\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f46\u5168\u5c40\u6536\u655b\u4ecd\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u672a\u89e3\u51b3\u7684\u6311\u6218\u3002"}}

Current reasoning-augmented paradigms most rely on explicit thought processes, where intermediate reasoning is decoded into discrete text at fixed steps with frequent image decoding and re-encoding, leading to inefficiencies, information loss, and cognitive mismatches. To bridge this gap, we introduce LatentMorph, a novel framework that seamlessly integrates implicit latent reasoning into the T2I generation process. At its core, LatentMorph introduces four lightweight components: (i) a condenser for summarizing intermediate generation states into compact visual memory, (ii) a translator for converting latent thoughts into actionable guidance, (iii) a shaper for dynamically steering next image token predictions, and (iv) an RL-trained invoker for adaptively determining when to invoke reasoning. By performing reasoning entirely in continuous latent spaces, LatentMorph avoids the bottlenecks of explicit reasoning and enables more adaptive self-refinement. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LatentMorph (I) enhances the base model Janus-Pro by $16\\%$ on GenEval and $25\\%$ on T2I-CompBench; (II) outperforms explicit paradigms (e.g., TwiG) by $15\\%$ and $11\\%$ on abstract reasoning tasks like WISE and IPV-Txt, (III) while reducing inference time by $44\\%$ and token consumption by $51\\%$; and (IV) exhibits $71\\%$ cognitive alignment with human intuition on reasoning invocation.", "AI": {"tldr": "LatentMorph\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u5728\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u6267\u884c\u9690\u5f0f\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u56db\u4e2a\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u7ec4\u4ef6\u5b9e\u73b0\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u751f\u6210\u8d28\u91cf\u5e76\u5927\u5e45\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u52a8\u6001\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u7ec6\u5316\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u800c\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u589e\u5f3a\u8303\u5f0f\u4f9d\u8d56\u663e\u5f0f\u601d\u7ef4\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u5728\u56fa\u5b9a\u6b65\u9aa4\u5c06\u4e2d\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u89e3\u7801\u4e3a\u79bb\u6563\u6587\u672c\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\u3001\u4fe1\u606f\u4e22\u5931\u548c\u8ba4\u77e5\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faLatentMorph\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u8fde\u7eed\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u6267\u884c\u9690\u5f0f\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u5305\u542b\u56db\u4e2a\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff1a\u51b7\u51dd\u5668\uff08\u603b\u7ed3\u4e2d\u95f4\u751f\u6210\u72b6\u6001\u4e3a\u89c6\u89c9\u8bb0\u5fc6\uff09\u3001\u7ffb\u8bd1\u5668\uff08\u5c06\u6f5c\u5728\u601d\u7ef4\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u53ef\u64cd\u4f5c\u6307\u5bfc\uff09\u3001\u5851\u5f62\u5668\uff08\u52a8\u6001\u5f15\u5bfc\u4e0b\u4e00\u4e2a\u56fe\u50cf\u6807\u8bb0\u9884\u6d4b\uff09\u548cRL\u8bad\u7ec3\u8c03\u7528\u5668\uff08\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u786e\u5b9a\u4f55\u65f6\u8c03\u7528\u63a8\u7406\uff09\u3002", "result": "1) \u5728Janus-Pro\u57fa\u7840\u4e0a\uff0cGenEval\u63d0\u534716%\uff0cT2I-CompBench\u63d0\u534725%\uff1b2) \u5728\u62bd\u8c61\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u663e\u5f0f\u8303\u5f0f\uff08\u5982TwiG\uff0915%\u548c11%\uff1b3) \u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u95f4\u51cf\u5c1144%\uff0c\u6807\u8bb0\u6d88\u8017\u51cf\u5c1151%\uff1b4) \u5728\u63a8\u7406\u8c03\u7528\u4e0a\u4e0e\u4eba\u7c7b\u76f4\u89c9\u7684\u8ba4\u77e5\u5bf9\u9f50\u5ea6\u8fbe71%\u3002", "conclusion": "LatentMorph\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u6267\u884c\u9690\u5f0f\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u663e\u5f0f\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u74f6\u9888\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u66f4\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u3001\u66f4\u7b26\u5408\u4eba\u7c7b\u8ba4\u77e5\u7684\u6587\u672c\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\u3002"}}

Scene completion methods can infer the missing parts of incomplete 3D LiDAR scenes. Recent methods adopt local point-level denoising diffusion probabilistic models, which require predicting Gaussian noise, leading to a mismatch between training and inference initial distributions. This paper introduces the first flow matching framework for 3D LiDAR scene completion, improving upon diffusion-based methods by ensuring consistent initial distributions between training and inference. The model employs a nearest neighbor flow matching loss and a Chamfer distance loss to enhance both local structure and global coverage in the alignment of point clouds.

These objectives are not tailored to the structure of preference learning, leaving open the design of problem-specific algorithms. In this work, we identify a simple intuition specific to preference learning that calls into question the suitability of these existing design objectives. Motivated by this insight, we propose two active learning algorithms.

Current dense methods suffer computational waste on empty voxels, while sparse query-based approaches lack robustness in diverse and complex indoor scenes. In this paper, we propose DiScene, a novel sparse query-based framework that leverages multi-level distillation to achieve efficient and robust occupancy prediction. In particular, our method incorporates two key innovations: (1) a Multi-level Consistent Knowledge Distillation strategy, which transfers hierarchical representations from large teacher models to lightweight students through coordinated alignment across four levels, including encoder-level feature alignment, query-level feature matching, prior-level spatial guidance, and anchor-level high-confidence knowledge transfer and (2) a Teacher-Guided Initialization policy, employing optimized parameter warm-up to accelerate model convergence. Validated on the Occ-Scannet benchmark, DiScene achieves 23.2 FPS without depth priors while outperforming our baseline method, OPUS, by 36.1% and even better than the depth-enhanced version, OPUS\u2020. With depth integration, DiScene\u2020 attains new SOTA performance, surpassing EmbodiedOcc by 3.7% with 1.62$\\times$ faster inference speed.

We propose a novel method for effective disentanglement of the style and content in human motion data to facilitate style transfer.

To model this hierarchy, we employ Residual Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoders (RVQ-VAEs) to learn a coarse-to-fine representation of motion. We further enhance the disentanglement by integrating contrastive learning and a novel information leakage loss with codebook learning to organize the content and the style across different codebooks.

The core challenge is to effectively combine temporal numerical patterns with the context embedded in other modalities, such as text. While most existing methods align textual features with time-series patterns one step at a time, they neglect the multiscale temporal influences of contextual information such as time-series cycles and dynamic shifts. This mismatch between local alignment and global textual context can be addressed by spectral decomposition, which separates time series into frequency components capturing both short-term changes and long-term trends. In this paper, we propose SpecTF, a simple yet effective framework that integrates the effect of textual data on time series in the frequency domain. Our method extracts textual embeddings, projects them into the frequency domain, and fuses them with the time series' spectral components using a lightweight cross-attention mechanism.

We also approximate the reference model's scoring over long contexts by evaluating only the anchor clip, reducing computational overhead.

According to Imbens' criterion, true distribution balance requires matching the first moments with respect to any balancing function. We demonstrate that existing objectives fail to meet this criterion, as they enforce moment matching only for one or two predefined balancing functions, thus failing to achieve full distribution balance. To address this limitation, we propose direct forecasting with kernelized moment balancing (KMB-DF). Unlike existing objectives, KMB-DF adaptively selects the most informative balancing functions from a reproducing kernel hilbert space (RKHS) to enforce sufficient distribution balancing. We derive a tractable and differentiable objective that enables efficient estimation from empirical samples and seamless integration into gradient-based training pipelines. Extensive experiments across multiple models and datasets show that KMB-DF consistently improves forecasting accuracy and achieves state-of-the-art performance.

These probability predictions are translated into variance estimates, which are then fed into a convex optimization problem to determine the optimal rollout allocations under a hard compute budget constraint. Empirical results show that \\Ours~consistently improves sampling efficiency and achieves higher performance than uniform or heuristic allocation strategies in multiple benchmarks.

Hallucinations pose various harms, from erosion of trust to widespread misinformation. Existing hallucination evaluation, however, focuses only on correctness and often overlooks consistency, necessary to distinguish and address these harms. To bridge this gap, we introduce prompt multiplicity, a framework for quantifying consistency in LLM evaluations. Our analysis reveals significant multiplicity (over 50% inconsistency in benchmarks like Med-HALT), suggesting that hallucination-related harms have been severely misunderstood. Furthermore, we study the role of consistency in hallucination detection and mitigation. We find that: (a) detection techniques detect consistency, not correctness, and (b) mitigation techniques like RAG, while beneficial, can introduce additional inconsistencies. By integrating prompt multiplicity into hallucination evaluation, we provide an improved framework of potential harms and uncover critical limitations in current detection and mitigation strategies.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\"\u63d0\u793a\u591a\u6837\u6027\"\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u91cf\u5316\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u73b0\u6709\u5e7b\u89c9\u8bc4\u4f30\u8fc7\u4e8e\u5173\u6ce8\u6b63\u786e\u6027\u800c\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5bf9\u5e7b\u89c9\u76f8\u5173\u5371\u5bb3\u7684\u4e25\u91cd\u8bef\u89e3\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5e7b\u89c9\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u6b63\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u800c\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u8bc4\u4f30\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002\u8fd9\u79cd\u5c40\u9650\u6027\u5bfc\u81f4\u65e0\u6cd5\u51c6\u786e\u533a\u5206\u548c\u89e3\u51b3\u5e7b\u89c9\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u5404\u79cd\u5371\u5bb3\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u4fe1\u4efb\u4fb5\u8680\u548c\u9519\u8bef\u4fe1\u606f\u4f20\u64ad\u7b49\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "method": "\u4f5c\u8005\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\"\u63d0\u793a\u591a\u6837\u6027\"\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u91cf\u5316LLM\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u7684\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u591a\u4e2a\u63d0\u793a\u4e0b\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u54cd\u5e94\u6765\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u5728Med-HALT\u7b49\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u4e86\u9a8c\u8bc1\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u8d85\u8fc750%\u7684\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\uff08\u5728Med-HALT\u7b49\u57fa\u51c6\u4e2d\uff09\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5e7b\u89c9\u76f8\u5173\u5371\u5bb3\u88ab\u4e25\u91cd\u8bef\u89e3\u3002\u540c\u65f6\u53d1\u73b0\u73b0\u6709\u68c0\u6d4b\u6280\u672f\u4e3b\u8981\u68c0\u6d4b\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u800c\u975e\u6b63\u786e\u6027\uff0c\u800cRAG\u7b49\u7f13\u89e3\u6280\u672f\u867d\u7136\u6709\u76ca\u4f46\u53ef\u80fd\u5f15\u5165\u989d\u5916\u7684\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u63d0\u793a\u591a\u6837\u6027\u6846\u67b6\u6574\u5408\u5230\u5e7b\u89c9\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u6539\u8fdb\u7684\u5371\u5bb3\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5e76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5f53\u524d\u68c0\u6d4b\u548c\u7f13\u89e3\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u5173\u952e\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u4e86\u5728LLM\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e2d\u8003\u8651\u4e00\u81f4\u6027\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u3002"}}

Through large-scale evaluations on standard benchmarks, we find that leading transformer-based TSFMs exhibit redundant components in their intermediate layers. We introduce a set of tools for mechanistic interpretability of TSFMs, including ablations of specific components and direct logit attribution on the residual stream. Our findings are consistent across several leading TSFMs with diverse architectures, and across a diverse set of real-world and synthetic time-series datasets. We discover that all models in our study are robust to ablations of entire layers. Furthermore, we develop a theoretical framework framing transformers as kernel regressors, motivating a purely intrinsic strategy for ablating heads based on the stable rank of the per-head projection matrices. Using this approach, we uncover the specific heads responsible for degenerate phenomena widely observed in TSFMs, such as parroting of motifs from the context and seasonality bias.

Safety-critical medical imaging workflows benefit from intrinsic uncertainty-aware properties that can accurately reject OOD input. We implement the Spectral-normalized Neural Gaussian Process (SNGP), a set of lightweight modifications that apply spectral normalization and replace the final dense layer with a Gaussian process layer to improve single-model uncertainty estimation and OOD detection. We evaluate SNGP vs. deterministic and MonteCarlo dropout on six datasets across three biomedical classification tasks: white blood cells, amyloid plaques, and colorectal histopathology.

Flow Matching (FM) enables one-step generation, but integrating it into Maximum Entropy Reinforcement Learning (MaxEnt RL) is challenging: the optimal policy is an intractable energy-based distribution, and the efficient log-likelihood estimation required to balance exploration and exploitation suffers from severe discretization bias. We propose \\textbf{F}low-based \\textbf{L}og-likelihood-\\textbf{A}ware \\textbf{M}aximum \\textbf{E}ntropy RL (\\textbf{FLAME}), a principled framework that addresses these challenges. First, we derive a Q-Reweighted FM objective that bypasses partition function estimation via importance reweighting. Second, we design a decoupled entropy estimator that rigorously corrects bias, which enables efficient exploration and brings the policy closer to the optimal MaxEnt policy. Third, we integrate the MeanFlow formulation to achieve expressive and efficient one-step control. Empirical results on MuJoCo show that FLAME outperforms Gaussian baselines and matches multi-step diffusion policies with significantly lower inference cost.

Existing frameworks typically adopt Bradley-Terry-style preference modeling or leverage generative VLMs as judges, and subsequently optimize visual generation models via reinforcement learning. However, current RMs suffer from inherent limitations: they often follow a one-size-fits-all paradigm that assumes a monolithic preference distribution or relies on fixed evaluation rubrics. As a result, they are insensitive to content-specific visual cues, leading to systematic misalignment with subjective and context-dependent human preferences. To this end, inspired by human assessment, we propose UnifiedReward-Flex, a unified personalized reward model for vision generation that couples reward modeling with flexible and context-adaptive reasoning. Specifically, given a prompt and the generated visual content, it first interprets the semantic intent and grounds on visual evidence, then dynamically constructs a hierarchical assessment by instantiating fine-grained criteria under both predefined and self-generated high-level dimensions. Our training pipeline follows a two-stage process: (1) we first distill structured, high-quality reasoning traces from advanced closed-source VLMs to bootstrap SFT, equipping the model with flexible and context-adaptive reasoning behaviors; (2) we then perform direct preference optimization (DPO) on carefully curated preference pairs to further strengthen reasoning fidelity and discriminative alignment. To validate the effectiveness, we integrate UnifiedReward-Flex into the GRPO framework for image and video synthesis, and extensive results demonstrate its superiority.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faUnifiedReward-Flex\uff0c\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u89c6\u89c9\u751f\u6210\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u63a8\u7406\u89e3\u51b3\u73b0\u6709\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u5185\u5bb9\u7279\u5b9a\u89c6\u89c9\u7ebf\u7d22\u4e0d\u654f\u611f\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u5b58\u5728\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff1a\u91c7\u7528\u4e00\u5200\u5207\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u5047\u8bbe\u5355\u4e00\u504f\u597d\u5206\u5e03\u6216\u4f9d\u8d56\u56fa\u5b9a\u8bc4\u4f30\u6807\u51c6\uff0c\u5bf9\u5185\u5bb9\u7279\u5b9a\u89c6\u89c9\u7ebf\u7d22\u4e0d\u654f\u611f\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u4e0e\u4e3b\u89c2\u548c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u4eba\u7c7b\u504f\u597d\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u9519\u4f4d\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faUnifiedReward-Flex\uff0c\u9996\u5148\u89e3\u91ca\u8bed\u4e49\u610f\u56fe\u5e76\u57fa\u4e8e\u89c6\u89c9\u8bc1\u636e\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u901a\u8fc7\u5b9e\u4f8b\u5316\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u6807\u51c6\u52a8\u6001\u6784\u5efa\u5206\u5c42\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\uff1a1) \u4ece\u5148\u8fdb\u95ed\u6e90VLM\u84b8\u998f\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u63a8\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\u8fdb\u884cSFT\uff1b2) \u5728\u7cbe\u5fc3\u7b56\u5212\u7684\u504f\u597d\u5bf9\u4e0a\u6267\u884c\u76f4\u63a5\u504f\u597d\u4f18\u5316(DPO)\u3002", "result": "\u5c06UnifiedReward-Flex\u96c6\u6210\u5230GRPO\u6846\u67b6\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u89c6\u9891\u5408\u6210\uff0c\u5e7f\u6cdb\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\u5176\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "UnifiedReward-Flex\u901a\u8fc7\u8026\u5408\u5956\u52b1\u5efa\u6a21\u4e0e\u7075\u6d3b\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u5956\u52b1\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5c40\u9650\u6027\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u89c6\u89c9\u751f\u6210\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002"}}

Because both mechanisms can yield identical task success on the original interface, benchmark scores alone are not identifiable evidence of environment-invariant capability. We propose PIPE, a protocol-level evaluation augmentation for diagnosing interface reliance by minimally rewriting environment interfaces while preserving task semantics and execution behavior. Across 16 environments from AgentBench and AgentGym and a range of open-source and API-based agents, PIPE reveals that trajectory-SFT substantially amplifies interface shortcutting: trained agents degrade sharply under minimal interface rewrites, while non-trajectory-trained models remain largely stable. We further introduce Interface Reliance (IR), a counterbalanced alias-based metric that quantifies preference for training-time interfaces, and show that interface shortcutting exhibits environment-dependent, non-monotonic training dynamics that remain invisible under standard evaluation.

While existing world models can be efficiently optimized on synthetic data with perfect ground-truth, they lack an effective training paradigm for real-world videos due to noisy pose estimations and the scarcity of viewpoint revisits. To bridge this gap, we first introduce a Hierarchical Pose-free Memory Compressor (HPMC) that recursively distills historical latents into a fixed-budget representation. By jointly optimizing the compressor with the generative backbone, HPMC enables the model to autonomously anchor generations in the distant past with bounded computational cost, eliminating the need for explicit geometric priors. Second, we propose an Uncertainty-aware Action Labeling module that discretizes continuous motion into a tri-state logic. This strategy maximizes the utilization of raw video data while shielding the deterministic action space from being corrupted by noisy trajectories, ensuring robust action-response learning. Furthermore, guided by insights from a pilot toy study, we employ a Revisit-Dense Finetuning Strategy using a compact, 30-minute dataset to efficiently activate the model's long-range loop-closure capabilities.

Code available", "summary": "Emergent misalignment can arise when a language model is fine-tuned on a narrowly scoped supervised objective: the model learns the target behavior, yet also develops undesirable out-of-domain behaviors. We investigate a mechanistic approach to preventing emergent misalignment by identifying a small set of internal features that reliably control the misaligned behavior and then discouraging the model from strengthening these features during fine-tuning. Across six fine-tuning domains, blocking (i.e., constraining) a fixed set of features achieves up to 95\\% relative reduction in emergent misalignment with no degradation in model quality or target-task performance. We strengthen validity with disjoint selection/evaluation splits, multiple independent judges, multiple random seeds for key settings, quality metrics, and extensive ablations demonstrating that the reduction in misalignment is specific to the identified mechanism. We also characterize a limiting regime in which misalignment re-emerges under prolonged fine-tuning, present evidence consistent with rerouting through alternative features or layers, and evaluate modifications that partially restore the misalignment-blocking effect. Overall, our results show that targeted training-time constraints on internal mechanisms can mitigate emergent misalignment without degrading target-task performance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u673a\u5236\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\u9632\u6b62\u5fae\u8c03\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u65f6\u51fa\u73b0\u7684\"\u6d8c\u73b0\u6027\u9519\u4f4d\"\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8bc6\u522b\u63a7\u5236\u9519\u4f4d\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u5c0f\u578b\u5185\u90e8\u7279\u5f81\u96c6\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u5fae\u8c03\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u963b\u6b62\u6a21\u578b\u5f3a\u5316\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5728\u4e0d\u5f71\u54cd\u6a21\u578b\u8d28\u91cf\u548c\u76ee\u6807\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u9519\u4f4d\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u72ed\u7a84\u8303\u56f4\u7684\u76d1\u7763\u76ee\u6807\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u5fae\u8c03\u65f6\uff0c\u4f1a\u51fa\u73b0\"\u6d8c\u73b0\u6027\u9519\u4f4d\"\u73b0\u8c61\uff1a\u6a21\u578b\u5b66\u4f1a\u4e86\u76ee\u6807\u884c\u4e3a\uff0c\u4f46\u4e5f\u53d1\u5c55\u51fa\u4e0d\u826f\u7684\u57df\u5916\u884c\u4e3a\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u673a\u5236\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u9632\u6b62\u8fd9\u79cd\u9519\u4f4d\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u8bc6\u522b\u53ef\u9760\u63a7\u5236\u9519\u4f4d\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u5c0f\u578b\u5185\u90e8\u7279\u5f81\u96c6\uff0c\u7136\u540e\u5728\u5fae\u8c03\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u901a\u8fc7\"\u963b\u65ad\"\uff08\u7ea6\u675f\uff09\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7279\u5f81\u6765\u9632\u6b62\u6a21\u578b\u5f3a\u5316\u5b83\u4eec\u3002\u5728\u516d\u4e2a\u5fae\u8c03\u9886\u57df\u8fdb\u884c\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u4e0d\u76f8\u4ea4\u7684\u9009\u62e9/\u8bc4\u4f30\u5206\u5272\u3001\u591a\u4e2a\u72ec\u7acb\u8bc4\u4f30\u8005\u3001\u591a\u4e2a\u968f\u673a\u79cd\u5b50\u7b49\u65b9\u6cd5\u9a8c\u8bc1\u6709\u6548\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u963b\u65ad\u56fa\u5b9a\u7279\u5f81\u96c6\u53ef\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u8fbe95%\u7684\u76f8\u5bf9\u9519\u4f4d\u51cf\u5c11\uff0c\u4e14\u4e0d\u964d\u4f4e\u6a21\u578b\u8d28\u91cf\u6216\u76ee\u6807\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u8fd8\u53d1\u73b0\u957f\u65f6\u95f4\u5fae\u8c03\u4e0b\u9519\u4f4d\u4f1a\u91cd\u65b0\u51fa\u73b0\uff0c\u53ef\u80fd\u901a\u8fc7\u66ff\u4ee3\u7279\u5f81\u6216\u5c42\u8fdb\u884c\u91cd\u8def\u7531\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc4\u4f30\u4e86\u90e8\u5206\u6062\u590d\u963b\u65ad\u6548\u679c\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "\u9488\u5bf9\u5185\u90e8\u673a\u5236\u7684\u9488\u5bf9\u6027\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u7ea6\u675f\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u51cf\u8f7b\u6d8c\u73b0\u6027\u9519\u4f4d\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4e0d\u635f\u5bb3\u76ee\u6807\u4efb\u52a1\u6027\u80fd\u3002\u8fd9\u4e3a\u63a7\u5236\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5fae\u8c03\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u610f\u5916\u884c\u4e3a\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u673a\u5236\u6027\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

However, we can't manage what we can't measure. Accurately quantifying the pools and fluxes in the carbon, nutrient, and water nexus of the agroecosystem is therefore essential for understanding the underlying drivers of GHG and developing effective mitigation strategies. Conventional approaches like soil sampling, process-based models, and black-box machine learning models are facing challenges such as data sparsity, high spatiotemporal heterogeneity, and complex subsurface biogeochemical and physical processes. Developing new trustworthy approaches such as AI-empowered models, will require the AI-ready benchmark dataset and outlined protocols, which unfortunately do not exist. In this work, we introduce a first-of-its-kind spatial-temporal agroecosystem GHG benchmark dataset that integrates physics-based model simulations from Ecosys and DayCent with real-world observations from eddy covariance flux towers and controlled-environment facilities. We evaluate the performance of various sequential deep learning models on carbon and nitrogen flux prediction, including LSTM-based models, temporal CNN-based model, and Transformer-based models. Furthermore, we explored transfer learning to leverage simulated data to improve the generalization of deep learning models on real-world observations.

One of the most common USD approaches is to maximize the Mutual Information (MI) between skill latent variables and states. However, MI-based methods tend to favor simple, static skills due to their invariance properties, limiting the discovery of dynamic, task-relevant behaviors. Distance-Maximizing Skill Discovery (DSD) promotes more dynamic skills by leveraging state-space distances, yet still fall short in encouraging comprehensive skill sets that engage all controllable factors or entities in the environment. In this work, we introduce SUSD, a novel framework that harnesses the compositional structure of environments by factorizing the state space into independent components (e.g., objects or controllable entities). SUSD allocates distinct skill variables to different factors, enabling more fine-grained control on the skill discovery process. A dynamic model also tracks learning across factors, adaptively steering the agent's focus toward underexplored factors. This structured approach not only promotes the discovery of richer and more diverse skills, but also yields a factorized skill representation that enables fine-grained and disentangled control over individual entities which facilitates efficient training of compositional downstream tasks via Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL). Our experimental results across three environments, with factors ranging from 1 to 10, demonstrate that our method can discover diverse and complex skills without supervision, significantly outperforming existing unsupervised skill discovery methods in factorized and complex environments.

While diffusion duality enables deterministic distillation for uniform models, these approaches generally underperform masked models and rely on complex integral operators. Conversely, in the masked domain, prior methods typically assume the absence of deterministic trajectories, forcing a reliance on stochastic distillation. To bridge this gap, we establish explicit Masked Diffusion Duality, proving that the masked process arises as the projection of a continuous Gaussian process via a novel maximum-value index preservation mechanism. Furthermore, we introduce Masked Consistency Distillation (MCD), a principled framework that leverages this duality to analytically construct the deterministic coupled trajectories required for consistency distillation, bypassing numerical ODE solvers. This result strictly improves upon prior stochastic distillation methods, achieving a 16$\\times$ inference speedup without compromising generation quality. Our findings not only provide a solid theoretical foundation connecting masked and continuous diffusion, but also unlock the full potential of consistency distillation for high-performance discrete generation.

Most existing approaches assume model congruity (i.e., the use of fully or partially homogeneous models) across users, which limits their applicability in realistic settings. To overcome this limitation, we aim to learn a shared representation space across tasks rather than shared model parameters. To this end, we propose Muscle loss, a novel contrastive learning objective that simultaneously aligns representations from all participating models. Unlike existing multi-view or multi-model contrastive methods, which typically align models pairwise, Muscle loss can effectively capture dependencies across tasks because its minimization is equivalent to the maximization of mutual information among all the models' representations. Building on this principle, we develop FedMuscle, a practical and communication-efficient FMTL algorithm that naturally handles both model and task heterogeneity.

State-of-the-art post-hoc methods typically derive OOD scores from the output logits or penultimate feature vector obtained via global average pooling (GAP). We contend that this exclusive reliance on the logit or feature vector discards a rich, complementary signal: the raw channel-wise statistics of the pre-pooling feature map lost in GAP. In this paper, we introduce Catalyst, a post-hoc framework that exploits these under-explored signals. Catalyst computes an input-dependent scaling factor ($\u03b3$) on-the-fly from these raw statistics (e.g., mean, standard deviation, and maximum activation). This $\u03b3$ is then fused with the existing baseline score, multiplicatively modulating it -- an ``elastic scaling'' -- to push the ID and OOD distributions further apart. We demonstrate Catalyst is a generalizable framework: it seamlessly integrates with logit-based methods (e.g., Energy, ReAct, SCALE) and also provides a significant boost to distance-based detectors like KNN. As a result, Catalyst achieves substantial and consistent performance gains, reducing the average False Positive Rate by 32.87 on CIFAR-10 (ResNet-18), 27.94% on CIFAR-100 (ResNet-18), and 22.25% on ImageNet (ResNet-50).

Conformal Prediction (CP) provides a distribution-free framework for this task, yet its standard formulations rely on exchangeability assumptions that are violated by the distribution shifts inherent in real-world robotics. Existing online CP methods maintain target coverage by adaptively scaling the conformal threshold, but typically employ a static nonconformity score function. We show that this fixed geometry leads to highly conservative, volume-inefficient prediction regions when environments undergo structural shifts. To address this, we propose \\textbf{AdaptNC}, a framework for the joint online adaptation of both the nonconformity score parameters and the conformal threshold. AdaptNC leverages an adaptive reweighting scheme to optimize score functions, and introduces a replay buffer mechanism to mitigate the coverage instability that occurs during score transitions. We evaluate AdaptNC on diverse robotic benchmarks involving multi-agent policy changes, environmental changes and sensor degradation.

Despite advances in transformer-based models for individual tree crown segmentation, performance remains low in most forests, especially tropical ones. To this end, we introduce SelvaMask, a new tropical dataset containing over 8,800 manually delineated tree crowns across three Neotropical forest sites in Panama, Brazil, and Ecuador. SelvaMask features comprehensive annotations, including an inter-annotator agreement evaluation, capturing the dense structure of tropical forests and highlighting the difficulty of the task.

Our approach reaches state-of-the-art performance, outperforming both zero-shot generalist models and fully supervised end-to-end methods in dense tropical forests.

The Minimum Path Variance Principle for Accurate and Stable Score-Based Density Ratio Estimation", "comment": null, "summary": "Score-based methods have emerged as a powerful framework for density ratio estimation (DRE), but they face an important paradox in that, while theoretically path-independent, their practical performance depends critically on the chosen path schedule. We resolve this issue by proving that tractable training objectives differ from the ideal, ground-truth objective by a crucial, overlooked term: the path variance of the time score. To address this, we propose MinPV (\\textbf{Min}imum \\textbf{P}ath \\textbf{V}ariance) Principle, which introduces a principled heuristic to minimize the overlooked path variance. Our key contribution is the derivation of a closed-form expression for the variance, turning an intractable problem into a tractable optimization. By parameterizing the path with a flexible Kumaraswamy Mixture Model, our method learns a data-adaptive, low-variance path without heuristic selection. This principled optimization of the complete objective yields more accurate and stable estimators, establishing new state-of-the-art results on challenging benchmarks.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u5206\u6570\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5bc6\u5ea6\u6bd4\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u7406\u8bba\u8def\u5f84\u72ec\u7acb\u4f46\u5b9e\u9645\u6027\u80fd\u4f9d\u8d56\u8def\u5f84\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u77db\u76fe\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u901a\u8fc7\u63ed\u793a\u8bad\u7ec3\u76ee\u6807\u4e0e\u7406\u60f3\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u5dee\u5f02\u5728\u4e8e\u65f6\u95f4\u5206\u6570\u7684\u8def\u5f84\u65b9\u5dee\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u6700\u5c0f\u8def\u5f84\u65b9\u5dee\u539f\u5219\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e00\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u5206\u6570\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u5bc6\u5ea6\u6bd4\u4f30\u8ba1\u4e2d\u9762\u4e34\u4e00\u4e2a\u91cd\u8981\u77db\u76fe\uff1a\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u8def\u5f84\u72ec\u7acb\uff0c\u4f46\u5b9e\u9645\u6027\u80fd\u4e25\u91cd\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u8def\u5f84\u8c03\u5ea6\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u8fd9\u4e00\u73b0\u8c61\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u89e3\u91ca\u548c\u7cfb\u7edf\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u6700\u5c0f\u8def\u5f84\u65b9\u5dee\u539f\u5219\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u8def\u5f84\u65b9\u5dee\u7684\u95ed\u5f0f\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\uff0c\u5c06\u4e0d\u53ef\u89e3\u95ee\u9898\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u53ef\u4f18\u5316\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u7075\u6d3b\u7684Kumaraswamy\u6df7\u5408\u6a21\u578b\u53c2\u6570\u5316\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u5b66\u4e60\u6570\u636e\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u3001\u4f4e\u65b9\u5dee\u7684\u8def\u5f84\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u9009\u62e9\u3002", "result": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u5b8c\u6574\u76ee\u6807\u5f97\u5230\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u548c\u7a33\u5b9a\u7684\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\uff0c\u5728\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u57fa\u4e8e\u5206\u6570\u7684\u5bc6\u5ea6\u6bd4\u4f30\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\u8def\u5f84\u65b9\u5dee\u7684\u5173\u952e\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u6700\u5c0f\u8def\u5f84\u65b9\u5dee\u539f\u5219\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u95ed\u5f0f\u4f18\u5316\u8def\u5f84\u65b9\u5dee\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u4f30\u8ba1\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u8def\u5f84\u72ec\u7acb\u4e0e\u5b9e\u9645\u8def\u5f84\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u77db\u76fe\u3002"}}

However, capturing temporal dependencies and multivariate correlations within patch-level representation learning remains underexplored, and reliance on single-scale patterns limits the detection of anomalies across different temporal ranges. Furthermore, focusing on normal data representations makes models vulnerable to distribution shifts at inference time. To address these limitations, we propose Codebook-based Online-adaptive Multi-scale Embedding for Time-series anomaly detection (COMET), which consists of three key components: (1) Multi-scale Patch Encoding captures temporal dependencies and inter-variable correlations across multiple patch scales. (2) Vector-Quantized Coreset learns representative normal patterns via codebook and detects anomalies with a dual-score combining quantization error and memory distance. (3) Online Codebook Adaptation generates pseudo-labels based on codebook entries and dynamically adapts the model at inference through contrastive learning.

We propose a gated multi-head Transformer architecture based on Swin U-Net, augmented with inter-slice context integration and a parallel detection head, which jointly performs slice-level structure detection via a multi-layer perceptron and pixel-level segmentation through a context-enhanced stream. Detection outputs gate the segmentation predictions to suppress false positives in anatomically invalid slices, and training uses slice-wise Tversky loss to address class imbalance. Experiments on the Prostate-Anatomical-Edge-Cases dataset from The Cancer Imaging Archive demonstrate that the gated model substantially outperforms a non-gated segmentation-only baseline, achieving a mean Dice loss of $0.013 \\pm 0.036$ versus $0.732 \\pm 0.314$, with detection probabilities strongly correlated with anatomical presence, effectively eliminating spurious segmentations. In contrast, the non-gated model exhibited higher variability and persistent false positives across all slices. These results indicate that detection-based gating enhances robustness and anatomical plausibility in automated segmentation applications, reducing hallucinated predictions without compromising segmentation quality in valid slices, and offers a promising approach for improving the reliability of clinical radiotherapy auto-contouring workflows.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u57fa\u4e8eSwin U-Net\u7684\u95e8\u63a7\u591a\u5934Transformer\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5207\u7247\u7ea7\u7ed3\u6784\u68c0\u6d4b\u95e8\u63a7\u5206\u5272\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u6291\u5236\u89e3\u5256\u65e0\u6548\u5207\u7247\u4e2d\u7684\u5047\u9633\u6027\u5206\u5272", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u81ea\u52a8\u5206\u5272\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7f3a\u4e4f\u76ee\u6807\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u5207\u7247\u4e2d\u7ecf\u5e38\u4ea7\u751f\u89e3\u5256\u4e0a\u4e0d\u5408\u7406\u7684\u5047\u9633\u6027\uff08\u5e7b\u89c9\uff09\uff0c\u5f71\u54cd\u653e\u7597\u4e34\u5e8a\u5e94\u7528\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027", "method": "\u57fa\u4e8eSwin U-Net\u7684\u95e8\u63a7\u591a\u5934Transformer\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u5207\u7247\u95f4\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u96c6\u6210\u548c\u5e73\u884c\u68c0\u6d4b\u5934\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u5c42\u611f\u77e5\u5668\u8fdb\u884c\u5207\u7247\u7ea7\u7ed3\u6784\u68c0\u6d4b\uff0c\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u589e\u5f3a\u6d41\u8fdb\u884c\u50cf\u7d20\u7ea7\u5206\u5272\uff0c\u68c0\u6d4b\u8f93\u51fa\u95e8\u63a7\u5206\u5272\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5207\u7247\u7ea7Tversky\u635f\u5931\u89e3\u51b3\u7c7b\u522b\u4e0d\u5e73\u8861", "result": "\u5728Prostate-Anatomical-Edge-Cases\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\uff0c\u95e8\u63a7\u6a21\u578b\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u975e\u95e8\u63a7\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u5e73\u5747Dice\u635f\u5931\u4e3a0.013\u00b10.036 vs 0.732\u00b10.314\uff0c\u68c0\u6d4b\u6982\u7387\u4e0e\u89e3\u5256\u5b58\u5728\u5f3a\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u6d88\u9664\u865a\u5047\u5206\u5272", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u68c0\u6d4b\u7684\u95e8\u63a7\u673a\u5236\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u81ea\u52a8\u5206\u5272\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u89e3\u5256\u5408\u7406\u6027\uff0c\u5728\u4e0d\u5f71\u54cd\u6709\u6548\u5207\u7247\u5206\u5272\u8d28\u91cf\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u51cf\u5c11\u5e7b\u89c9\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u4e3a\u6539\u5584\u4e34\u5e8a\u653e\u7597\u81ea\u52a8\u52fe\u753b\u5de5\u4f5c\u6d41\u7a0b\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5"}}

Adam(W), versions of which are go-to optimizers for many tasks such as next token prediction, has two momentum hyperparameters $(\u03b2_1, \u03b2_2)$ controlling memory and one very important hyperparameter, batch size, controlling (in particular) the amount mini-batch noise. We introduce a theoretical framework to understand how mini-batch noise influences the implicit bias of memory in Adam (depending on $\u03b2_1$, $\u03b2_2$) towards sharper or flatter regions of the loss landscape, which is commonly observed to correlate with the generalization gap in multi-epoch training. We find that in the case of large batch sizes, higher $\u03b2_2$ increases the magnitude of anti-regularization by memory (hurting generalization), but as the batch size becomes smaller, the dependence of (anti-)regulariation on $\u03b2_2$ is reversed. A similar monotonicity shift (in the opposite direction) happens in $\u03b2_1$. In particular, the commonly \"default\" pair $(\u03b2_1, \u03b2_2) = (0.9, 0.999)$ is a good choice if batches are small; for larger batches, in many settings moving $\u03b2_1$ closer to $\u03b2_2$ is much better in terms of validation accuracy in multi-epoch training. Moreover, our theoretical derivations connect the scale of the batch size at which the shift happens to the scale of the critical batch size. We illustrate this effect in experiments with small-scale data in the about-to-overfit regime.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u5206\u6790Adam\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u4e2d\u6279\u91cf\u5927\u5c0f\u5982\u4f55\u901a\u8fc7\u5f71\u54cd\u5c0f\u6279\u91cf\u566a\u58f0\u6765\u8c03\u8282\u52a8\u91cf\u8d85\u53c2\u6570(\u03b2\u2081, \u03b2\u2082)\u7684\u9690\u5f0f\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5f71\u54cd\u635f\u5931\u666f\u89c2\u7684\u9510\u5ea6\u4e0e\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u7740\u9ad8\u8d28\u91cf\u6570\u636e\u6709\u9650\u800c\u8ba1\u7b97\u8d44\u6e90\u589e\u957f\uff0c\u591a\u8f6e\u8bad\u7ec3\u5728\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u5404\u5b50\u9886\u57df\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u65e5\u76ca\u51f8\u663e\u3002Adam(W)\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8bb8\u591a\u4efb\u52a1\uff08\u5982\u4e0b\u4e00\u4e2a\u8bcd\u9884\u6d4b\uff09\u7684\u9996\u9009\u4f18\u5316\u5668\uff0c\u5176\u52a8\u91cf\u8d85\u53c2\u6570(\u03b2\u2081, \u03b2\u2082)\u63a7\u5236\u8bb0\u5fc6\uff0c\u6279\u91cf\u5927\u5c0f\u63a7\u5236\u5c0f\u6279\u91cf\u566a\u58f0\u3002\u9700\u8981\u7406\u89e3\u5c0f\u6279\u91cf\u566a\u58f0\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cdAdam\u4e2d\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7684\u9690\u5f0f\u504f\u5dee\uff0c\u8fd9\u79cd\u504f\u5dee\u901a\u5e38\u4e0e\u591a\u8f6e\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u7684\u6cdb\u5316\u5dee\u8ddd\u76f8\u5173\u3002", "method": "\u5f15\u5165\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u5206\u6790\u5c0f\u6279\u91cf\u566a\u58f0\u5982\u4f55\u5f71\u54cdAdam\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u4e2d\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7684\u9690\u5f0f\u504f\u5dee\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u7406\u8bba\u63a8\u5bfc\u8fde\u63a5\u6279\u91cf\u5927\u5c0f\u53d8\u5316\u65f6(\u03b2\u2081, \u03b2\u2082)\u5bf9\u6b63\u5219\u5316/\u53cd\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u6548\u679c\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5e76\u5efa\u7acb\u6279\u91cf\u5927\u5c0f\u53d8\u5316\u4e34\u754c\u70b9\u4e0e\u4e34\u754c\u6279\u91cf\u5927\u5c0f\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff1a\u5728\u5927\u6279\u91cf\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u8f83\u9ad8\u7684\u03b2\u2082\u4f1a\u589e\u52a0\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7684\u53cd\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u5e45\u5ea6\uff08\u635f\u5bb3\u6cdb\u5316\uff09\uff1b\u4f46\u968f\u7740\u6279\u91cf\u53d8\u5c0f\uff0c(\u03b2\u2081, \u03b2\u2082)\u5bf9\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\u4f1a\u53d1\u751f\u53cd\u8f6c\u3002\u5e38\u7528\u7684\u9ed8\u8ba4\u53c2\u6570\u5bf9(0.9, 0.999)\u5728\u5c0f\u6279\u91cf\u65f6\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff1b\u5bf9\u4e8e\u5927\u6279\u91cf\uff0c\u5728\u8bb8\u591a\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\u5c06\u03b2\u2081\u79fb\u8fd1\u03b2\u2082\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u9ad8\u591a\u8f6e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u9a8c\u8bc1\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6279\u91cf\u5927\u5c0f\u901a\u8fc7\u8c03\u8282\u5c0f\u6279\u91cf\u566a\u58f0\u663e\u8457\u5f71\u54cdAdam\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u4e2d\u52a8\u91cf\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u9690\u5f0f\u504f\u5dee\u65b9\u5411\u3002\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u6279\u91cf\u5927\u5c0f\u53d8\u5316\u4e34\u754c\u70b9\u4e0e\u4e34\u754c\u6279\u91cf\u5927\u5c0f\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u4e3a\u591a\u8f6e\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2dAdam\u8d85\u53c2\u6570\u8c03\u4f18\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u6307\u5bfc\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5373\u5c06\u8fc7\u62df\u5408\u7684\u5c0f\u89c4\u6a21\u6570\u636e\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u3002"}}

However, it is challenging to optimize high-dimensional pixel manifolds that contain many perceptually irrelevant signals, leaving existing pixel diffusion methods lagging behind latent diffusion models. We propose PixelGen, a simple pixel diffusion framework with perceptual supervision. Instead of modeling the full image manifold, PixelGen introduces two complementary perceptual losses to guide diffusion model towards learning a more meaningful perceptual manifold. An LPIPS loss facilitates learning better local patterns, while a DINO-based perceptual loss strengthens global semantics. With perceptual supervision, PixelGen surpasses strong latent diffusion baselines. It achieves an FID of 5.11 on ImageNet-256 without classifier-free guidance using only 80 training epochs, and demonstrates favorable scaling performance on large-scale text-to-image generation with a GenEval score of 0.79. PixelGen requires no VAEs, no latent representations, and no auxiliary stages, providing a simpler yet more powerful generative paradigm.

Although tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) enables the high-throughput acquisition of fragment fingerprints, these spectra often reflect higher-order interactions involving the concerted cleavage of multiple atoms and bonds-crucial for resolving complex isomers and non-local fragmentation mechanisms. However, most existing methods adopt atom-centric and pairwise interaction modeling, overlooking higher-order edge interactions and lacking the capacity to systematically capture essential many-body characteristics for structure generation. To overcome these limitations, we present MBGen, a Many-Body enhanced diffusion framework for de novo molecular structure Generation from mass spectra. By integrating a many-body attention mechanism and higher-order edge modeling, MBGen comprehensively leverages the rich structural information encoded in MS/MS spectra, enabling accurate de novo generation and isomer differentiation for novel molecules. Experimental results on the NPLIB1 and MassSpecGym benchmarks demonstrate that MBGen achieves superior performance, with improvements of up to 230% over state-of-the-art methods, highlighting the scientific value and practical utility of many-body modeling for mass spectrometry-based molecular generation. Further analysis and ablation studies show that our approach effectively captures higher-order interactions and exhibits enhanced sensitivity to complex isomeric and non-local fragmentation information.", "AI": {"tldr": "MBGen\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8e\u591a\u4f53\u589e\u5f3a\u6269\u6563\u6846\u67b6\u7684\u8d28\u8c31\u5206\u5b50\u7ed3\u6784\u751f\u6210\u65b0\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u4f53\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u548c\u9ad8\u9636\u8fb9\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5206\u5b50\u7ed3\u6784\u751f\u6210\u548c\u5f02\u6784\u4f53\u533a\u5206\u80fd\u529b", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8d28\u8c31\u5206\u5b50\u7ed3\u6784\u751f\u6210\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u91c7\u7528\u539f\u5b50\u4e2d\u5fc3\u548c\u6210\u5bf9\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u9ad8\u9636\u8fb9\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u7cfb\u7edf\u6355\u6349\u591a\u4f53\u7279\u5f81\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u590d\u6742\u5f02\u6784\u4f53\u548c\u975e\u5c40\u57df\u788e\u88c2\u673a\u5236\u7684\u89e3\u6790\u80fd\u529b", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMBGen\u591a\u4f53\u589e\u5f3a\u6269\u6563\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u96c6\u6210\u591a\u4f53\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u548c\u9ad8\u9636\u8fb9\u5efa\u6a21\uff0c\u5145\u5206\u5229\u7528MS/MS\u8c31\u56fe\u4e2d\u7f16\u7801\u7684\u4e30\u5bcc\u7ed3\u6784\u4fe1\u606f\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u51c6\u786e\u7684\u4ece\u5934\u5206\u5b50\u7ed3\u6784\u751f\u6210\u548c\u5f02\u6784\u4f53\u533a\u5206", "result": "\u5728NPLIB1\u548cMassSpecGym\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cMBGen\u6027\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u63d0\u5347\u5e45\u5ea6\u9ad8\u8fbe230%\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u6355\u6349\u9ad8\u9636\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\uff0c\u5bf9\u590d\u6742\u5f02\u6784\u4f53\u548c\u975e\u5c40\u57df\u788e\u88c2\u4fe1\u606f\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u589e\u5f3a\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6027", "conclusion": "\u591a\u4f53\u5efa\u6a21\u5728\u8d28\u8c31\u5206\u5b50\u7ed3\u6784\u751f\u6210\u4e2d\u5177\u6709\u91cd\u8981\u79d1\u5b66\u4ef7\u503c\u548c\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u610f\u4e49\uff0cMBGen\u6846\u67b6\u4e3a\u57fa\u4e8e\u8d28\u8c31\u7684\u5206\u5b50\u751f\u6210\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848"}}

Existing methods for artifact reduction, typically work in a post-hoc manner, consequently failing to intervene effectively during the core image formation process. Notably, current techniques require problematic and invasive modifications to the model weights, or depend on a computationally expensive and time-consuming process of regional refinement. To address these limitations, we propose DIAMOND, a training-free method that applies trajectory correction to mitigate artifacts during inference. By reconstructing an estimate of the clean sample at every step of the generative trajectory, DIAMOND actively steers the generation process away from latent states that lead to artifacts. Furthermore, we extend the proposed method to standard Diffusion Models, demonstrating that DIAMOND provides a robust, zero-shot path to high-fidelity, artifact-free image synthesis without the need for additional training or weight modifications in modern generative architectures.

Survey paper on spatial AI agents, embodied AI, graph neural networks, and world models", "summary": "While large language models have become the prevailing approach for agentic reasoning and planning, their success in symbolic domains does not readily translate to the physical world. Spatial intelligence, the ability to perceive 3D structure, reason about object relationships, and act under physical constraints, is an orthogonal capability that proves important for embodied agents. Existing surveys address either agentic architectures or spatial domains in isolation. None provide a unified framework connecting these complementary capabilities. This paper bridges that gap. Through a thorough review of over 2,000 papers, citing 742 works from top-tier venues, we introduce a unified three-axis taxonomy connecting agentic capabilities with spatial tasks across scales. Crucially, we distinguish spatial grounding (metric understanding of geometry and physics) from symbolic grounding (associating images with text), arguing that perception alone does not confer agency. Our analysis reveals three key findings mapped to these axes: (1) hierarchical memory systems (Capability axis) are important for long-horizon spatial tasks. (2) GNN-LLM integration (Task axis) is a promising approach for structured spatial reasoning. (3) World models (Scale axis) are essential for safe deployment across micro-to-macro spatial scales. We conclude by identifying six grand challenges and outlining directions for future research, including the need for unified evaluation frameworks to standardize cross-domain assessment. This taxonomy provides a foundation for unifying fragmented research efforts and enabling the next generation of spatially-aware autonomous systems in robotics, autonomous vehicles, and geospatial intelligence.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u4e09\u8f74\u5206\u7c7b\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u80fd\u529b\u4e0e\u7a7a\u95f4\u4efb\u52a1\u8fde\u63a5\u8d77\u6765\uff0c\u5f3a\u8c03\u7a7a\u95f4\u667a\u80fd\u5bf9\u5177\u8eab\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u6027\uff0c\u5e76\u8bc6\u522b\u4e86\u516d\u4e2a\u91cd\u5927\u6311\u6218\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7814\u7a76\u8981\u4e48\u5173\u6ce8\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u67b6\u6784\uff0c\u8981\u4e48\u5173\u6ce8\u7a7a\u95f4\u9886\u57df\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5c06\u8fd9\u4e24\u79cd\u4e92\u8865\u80fd\u529b\u7edf\u4e00\u8d77\u6765\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u3002\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u7b26\u53f7\u9886\u57df\u7684\u6210\u529f\u65e0\u6cd5\u76f4\u63a5\u8fc1\u79fb\u5230\u7269\u7406\u4e16\u754c\uff0c\u7a7a\u95f4\u667a\u80fd\uff08\u611f\u77e53D\u7ed3\u6784\u3001\u63a8\u7406\u7269\u4f53\u5173\u7cfb\u3001\u5728\u7269\u7406\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\u884c\u52a8\uff09\u5bf9\u5177\u8eab\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5bf92000\u591a\u7bc7\u8bba\u6587\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u6027\u7efc\u8ff0\uff08\u5f15\u7528742\u7bc7\u9876\u7ea7\u4f1a\u8bae\u8bba\u6587\uff09\uff0c\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u7edf\u4e00\u7684\u4e09\u8f74\u5206\u7c7b\u6cd5\uff1a\u80fd\u529b\u8f74\u3001\u4efb\u52a1\u8f74\u548c\u5c3a\u5ea6\u8f74\u3002\u533a\u5206\u4e86\u7a7a\u95f4\u57fa\u7840\uff08\u5bf9\u51e0\u4f55\u548c\u7269\u7406\u7684\u5ea6\u91cf\u7406\u89e3\uff09\u4e0e\u7b26\u53f7\u57fa\u7840\uff08\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0e\u6587\u672c\u5173\u8054\uff09\uff0c\u5e76\u5f3a\u8c03\u611f\u77e5\u672c\u8eab\u4e0d\u80fd\u8d4b\u4e88\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "result": "\u5206\u6790\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u4e09\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u53d1\u73b0\uff1a1\uff09\u5206\u5c42\u8bb0\u5fc6\u7cfb\u7edf\u5bf9\u957f\u65f6\u7a0b\u7a7a\u95f4\u4efb\u52a1\u5f88\u91cd\u8981\uff1b2\uff09GNN-LLM\u6574\u5408\u662f\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u6709\u524d\u666f\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1b3\uff09\u4e16\u754c\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u8de8\u5fae\u89c2\u5230\u5b8f\u89c2\u7a7a\u95f4\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7684\u5b89\u5168\u90e8\u7f72\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\u3002", "conclusion": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u516d\u4e2a\u91cd\u5927\u6311\u6218\u548c\u672a\u6765\u7814\u7a76\u65b9\u5411\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u9700\u8981\u7edf\u4e00\u8bc4\u4f30\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u6807\u51c6\u5316\u8de8\u9886\u57df\u8bc4\u4f30\u3002\u8be5\u5206\u7c7b\u6cd5\u4e3a\u7edf\u4e00\u788e\u7247\u5316\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u63a8\u52a8\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u3001\u81ea\u52a8\u9a7e\u9a76\u548c\u5730\u7406\u7a7a\u95f4\u667a\u80fd\u7b49\u9886\u57df\u4e0b\u4e00\u4ee3\u7a7a\u95f4\u611f\u77e5\u81ea\u4e3b\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u53d1\u5c55\u3002"}}

We formalize the memorization of such facts as a membership testing problem, unifying the discrete error metrics of Bloom filters with the continuous log-loss of LLMs. By analyzing this problem in the regime where facts are sparse in the universe of plausible claims, we establish a rate-distortion theorem: the optimal memory efficiency is characterized by the minimum KL divergence between score distributions on facts and non-facts. This theoretical framework provides a distinctive explanation for hallucination: even with optimal training, perfect data, and a simplified \"closed world\" setting, the information-theoretically optimal strategy under limited capacity is not to abstain or forget, but to assign high confidence to some non-facts, resulting in hallucination. We validate this theory empirically on synthetic data, showing that hallucinations persist as a natural consequence of lossy compression.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u5c06LLM\u5bf9\"\u968f\u673a\u4e8b\u5b9e\"\u7684\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u4e3a\u6210\u5458\u6d4b\u8bd5\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u901f\u7387-\u5931\u771f\u7406\u8bba\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u6700\u4f18\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u5b8c\u7f8e\u6570\u636e\u4e0b\uff0c\u6709\u9650\u5bb9\u91cf\u4e0b\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\u6700\u4f18\u7b56\u7565\u4f1a\u5bfc\u81f4\u5e7b\u89c9\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u6709\u635f\u538b\u7f29\u7684\u81ea\u7136\u7ed3\u679c\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7ecf\u5e38\u5bf9\u7f3a\u4e4f\u53ef\u63a8\u65ad\u6a21\u5f0f\u7684\"\u968f\u673a\u4e8b\u5b9e\"\u4ea7\u751f\u9ad8\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\u7684\u5e7b\u89c9\u3002\u4f5c\u8005\u65e8\u5728\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u8fd9\u79cd\u8bb0\u5fc6\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4ece\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\u89d2\u5ea6\u89e3\u91ca\u5e7b\u89c9\u7684\u6839\u672c\u539f\u56e0\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u968f\u673a\u4e8b\u5b9e\u7684\u8bb0\u5fc6\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u4e3a\u6210\u5458\u6d4b\u8bd5\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u7edf\u4e00\u4e86Bloom\u8fc7\u6ee4\u5668\u7684\u79bb\u6563\u8bef\u5dee\u5ea6\u91cf\u4e0eLLM\u7684\u8fde\u7eed\u5bf9\u6570\u635f\u5931\u3002\u5728\u4e8b\u5b9e\u5728\u53ef\u80fd\u4e3b\u5f20\u7684\u5b87\u5b99\u4e2d\u7a00\u758f\u7684\u5047\u8bbe\u4e0b\uff0c\u5efa\u7acb\u901f\u7387-\u5931\u771f\u5b9a\u7406\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e8b\u5b9e\u4e0e\u975e\u4e8b\u5b9e\u5f97\u5206\u5206\u5e03\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6700\u5c0fKL\u6563\u5ea6\u6765\u8868\u5f81\u6700\u4f18\u8bb0\u5fc6\u6548\u7387\u3002", "result": "\u7406\u8bba\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u6700\u4f18\u8bad\u7ec3\u3001\u5b8c\u7f8e\u6570\u636e\u548c\u7b80\u5316\"\u5c01\u95ed\u4e16\u754c\"\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\uff0c\u6709\u9650\u5bb9\u91cf\u4e0b\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\u6700\u4f18\u7b56\u7565\u4e0d\u662f\u653e\u5f03\u6216\u9057\u5fd8\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u5bf9\u67d0\u4e9b\u975e\u4e8b\u5b9e\u8d4b\u4e88\u9ad8\u7f6e\u4fe1\u5ea6\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u5bfc\u81f4\u5e7b\u89c9\u3002\u5728\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u8bc1\u9a8c\u8bc1\u8868\u660e\u5e7b\u89c9\u4f5c\u4e3a\u6709\u635f\u538b\u7f29\u7684\u81ea\u7136\u7ed3\u679c\u6301\u7eed\u5b58\u5728\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5e7b\u89c9\u662f\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6709\u9650\u5bb9\u91cf\u4e0b\u4fe1\u606f\u8bba\u6700\u4f18\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u5fc5\u7136\u7ed3\u679c\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u5177\u5907\u6700\u4f18\u8bad\u7ec3\u548c\u5b8c\u7f8e\u6570\u636e\u3002\u8fd9\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3LLM\u5e7b\u89c9\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u5e7b\u89c9\u662f\u6709\u635f\u538b\u7f29\u7684\u81ea\u7136\u4ea7\u7269\u800c\u975e\u53ef\u5b8c\u5168\u6d88\u9664\u7684\u7f3a\u9677\u3002"}}

We introduce Continuous Utility Direct Preference Optimization (CU-DPO), a framework that aligns models to a portfolio of prompt-based cognitive strategies by replacing binary labels with continuous scores that capture fine-grained reasoning quality. We prove that learning with K strategies yields a Theta(K log K) improvement in sample complexity over binary preferences, and that DPO converges to the entropy-regularized utility-maximizing policy. To exploit this signal, we propose a two-stage training pipeline: (i) strategy selection, which optimizes the model to choose the best strategy for a given problem via best-vs-all comparisons, and (ii) execution refinement, which trains the model to correctly execute the selected strategy using margin-stratified pairs. On mathematical reasoning benchmarks, CU-DPO improves strategy selection accuracy from 35-46 percent to 68-78 percent across seven base models, yielding consistent downstream reasoning gains of up to 6.6 points on in-distribution datasets with effective transfer to out-of-distribution tasks.", "AI": {"tldr": "CU-DPO\u6846\u67b6\u7528\u8fde\u7eed\u8bc4\u5206\u66ff\u4ee3\u4e8c\u5143\u504f\u597d\u6807\u7b7e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7b56\u7565\u9009\u62e9\u548c\u6267\u884c\u4f18\u5316\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u63a8\u7406\u8bc4\u4f30\u4f7f\u7528\u4e8c\u5143\u504f\u597d\u76d1\u7763\uff0c\u65e0\u6cd5\u6355\u6349\u63a8\u7406\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u90e8\u5206\u8fdb\u5c55\u548c\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u8d28\u91cf\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u591f\u91cf\u5316\u63a8\u7406\u8d28\u91cf\u8fde\u7eed\u53d8\u5316\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u66f4\u597d\u5730\u5bf9\u9f50\u6a21\u578b\u4e0e\u8ba4\u77e5\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u8fde\u7eed\u6548\u7528\u76f4\u63a5\u504f\u597d\u4f18\u5316(CU-DPO)\uff1a1) \u7528\u8fde\u7eed\u8bc4\u5206\u66ff\u4ee3\u4e8c\u5143\u6807\u7b7e\u6355\u6349\u7ec6\u7c92\u5ea6\u63a8\u7406\u8d28\u91cf\uff1b2) \u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\uff1a\u7b56\u7565\u9009\u62e9\u9636\u6bb5\u901a\u8fc7\u6700\u4f73vs\u6240\u6709\u6bd4\u8f83\u4f18\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u4f73\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u6267\u884c\u4f18\u5316\u9636\u6bb5\u4f7f\u7528\u8fb9\u7f18\u5206\u5c42\u5bf9\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u6b63\u786e\u6267\u884c\u9009\u5b9a\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cCU-DPO\u5c06\u7b56\u7565\u9009\u62e9\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4ece35-46%\u63d0\u5347\u523068-78%\uff0c\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u5185\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u83b7\u5f97\u9ad8\u8fbe6.6\u4e2a\u767e\u5206\u70b9\u7684\u4e0b\u6e38\u63a8\u7406\u589e\u76ca\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u8fc1\u79fb\u5230\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "conclusion": "CU-DPO\u901a\u8fc7\u8fde\u7eed\u8bc4\u5206\u548c\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u8bad\u7ec3\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u7406\u8bba\u8bc1\u660e\u5176\u6837\u672c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u4e8c\u5143\u504f\u597d\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e76\u80fd\u6536\u655b\u5230\u71b5\u6b63\u5219\u5316\u7684\u6548\u7528\u6700\u5927\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u3002"}}

To expose the implicit model multiplicity underlying CP, we build on recent results showing that, under a mild assumption, any full CP procedure induces a set of closed and convex predictive distributions, commonly referred to as a credal set. Importantly, the conformal prediction region (CPR) coincides exactly with the set of labels to which all distributions in the induced credal set assign probability at least $1-\u03b1$. As our first contribution, we prove that this characterisation also holds in split CP. Building on this connection, we then propose a computationally efficient and analytically tractable uncertainty measure, based on \\emph{Maximum Mean Imprecision}, to quantify the EPU by measuring the degree of conflicting information within the induced credal set. Experiments on active learning and selective classification demonstrate that the quantified EPU provides substantially more informative and fine-grained uncertainty assessments than reliance on CPR size alone.

Given the complexity of physical constraints, two challenges stand out. $(i)$ Physics-computation scalability: physics-informed learning can enforce physical regularization, but its computation (e.g., ODE integration) does not scale to extensive systems. $(ii)$ Knowledge-sharing efficiency: the attention mechanism is primarily computed within each system, which limits the extraction of shared ODE structures across systems. We show that enforcing ODE consistency does not require expensive nonlinear integration: a token-wise locally linear ODE representation preserves physical fidelity while scaling to foundation-model regimes. Thus, we propose novel token representations that respect locally linear ODE evolution. Such linearity substantially accelerates integration while accurately approximating the local data manifold. Second, we introduce a simple yet effective inter-system attention that augments attention with a common structure hub (CSH) that stores shared tokens and aggregates knowledge across systems. The resulting model, termed LASS-ODE (\\underline{LA}rge-\\underline{S}cale \\underline{S}mall \\underline{ODE}), is pretrained on our $40$GB ODE trajectory collections to enable strong in-domain performance, zero-shot generalization across diverse ODE systems, and additional improvements through fine-tuning.", "AI": {"tldr": "LASS-ODE\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u57fa\u4e8e\u5c40\u90e8\u7ebf\u6027ODE\u8868\u793a\u548c\u8de8\u7cfb\u7edf\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u7684\u5927\u89c4\u6a21ODE\u9884\u6d4b\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u7269\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u52a8\u6001\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u77e5\u8bc6\u5171\u4eab\u6548\u7387\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8bed\u8a00\u3001\u89c6\u89c9\u548c\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u9762\u53d6\u5f97\u4e86\u6210\u529f\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u7269\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u52a8\u6001\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u9762\u8fdb\u5c55\u6709\u9650\u3002\u4e3b\u8981\u9762\u4e34\u4e24\u4e2a\u6311\u6218\uff1a1\uff09\u7269\u7406\u8ba1\u7b97\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u95ee\u9898 - \u7269\u7406\u4fe1\u606f\u5b66\u4e60\u53ef\u4ee5\u5f3a\u5236\u6267\u884c\u7269\u7406\u6b63\u5219\u5316\uff0c\u4f46\u5176\u8ba1\u7b97\uff08\u5982ODE\u79ef\u5206\uff09\u65e0\u6cd5\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u7cfb\u7edf\uff1b2\uff09\u77e5\u8bc6\u5171\u4eab\u6548\u7387\u95ee\u9898 - \u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u4e3b\u8981\u5728\u5355\u4e2a\u7cfb\u7edf\u5185\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u8de8\u7cfb\u7edf\u5171\u4eabODE\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u63d0\u53d6\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faLASS-ODE\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u91c7\u7528\u4e24\u79cd\u5173\u952e\u6280\u672f\uff1a1\uff09\u57fa\u4e8e\u5c40\u90e8\u7ebf\u6027ODE\u8868\u793a\u7684token\u8868\u793a\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4fdd\u6301\u7269\u7406\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u540c\u65f6\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u89c4\u6a21\uff1b2\uff09\u5f15\u5165\u8de8\u7cfb\u7edf\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u516c\u5171\u7ed3\u6784\u4e2d\u5fc3\uff08CSH\uff09\u5b58\u50a8\u5171\u4eabtoken\u5e76\u805a\u5408\u8de8\u7cfb\u7edf\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u9ad8\u6548\u77e5\u8bc6\u5171\u4eab\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u572840GB ODE\u8f68\u8ff9\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u8fdb\u884c\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u9886\u57df\u5185\u6027\u80fd\u3001\u8de8\u4e0d\u540cODE\u7cfb\u7edf\u7684\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u6cdb\u5316\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u901a\u8fc7\u5fae\u8c03\u83b7\u5f97\u989d\u5916\u6539\u8fdb\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5c40\u90e8\u7ebf\u6027ODE\u8868\u793a\u548c\u8de8\u7cfb\u7edf\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff0cLASS-ODE\u6210\u529f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u7269\u7406\u7cfb\u7edf\u52a8\u6001\u9884\u6d4b\u4e2d\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\u6027\u548c\u77e5\u8bc6\u5171\u4eab\u6548\u7387\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21ODE\u7cfb\u7edf\u9884\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

Machine unlearning is pivotal for mitigating these risks, yet existing paradigms face a fundamental dilemma: aggressive unlearning often induces catastrophic forgetting that degrades model utility, whereas conservative strategies risk superficial forgetting, leaving models vulnerable to adversarial recovery. To address this trade-off, we propose $\\textbf{AGT$^{AO}$}$ (Adversarial Gating Training with Adaptive Orthogonality), a unified framework designed to reconcile robust erasure with utility preservation. Specifically, our approach introduces $\\textbf{Adaptive Orthogonality (AO)}$ to dynamically mitigate geometric gradient conflicts between forgetting and retention objectives, thereby minimizing unintended knowledge degradation. Concurrently, $\\textbf{Adversarial Gating Training (AGT)}$ formulates unlearning as a latent-space min-max game, employing a curriculum-based gating mechanism to simulate and counter internal recovery attempts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that $\\textbf{AGT$^{AO}$}$ achieves a superior trade-off between unlearning efficacy (KUR $\\approx$ 0.01) and model utility (MMLU 58.30).

Conventional CIL approaches implicitly assume that classes are morphologically static, focusing primarily on preserving previously learned representations as new classes are introduced. However, this assumption neglects intra-class evolution: a phenomenon wherein instances of the same semantic class undergo significant morphological transformations, such as a larva turning into a butterfly. Consequently, a model must both discriminate between classes and adapt to evolving appearances within a single class. To systematically address this challenge, we formalize Stage-Aware CIL (Stage-CIL), a paradigm in which each class is learned progressively through distinct morphological stages. To facilitate rigorous evaluation within this paradigm, we introduce the Stage-Bench, a 10-domain, 2-stages dataset and protocol that jointly measure inter- and intra-class forgetting. We further propose STAGE, a novel method that explicitly learns abstract and transferable evolution patterns within a fixed-size memory pool. By decoupling semantic identity from transformation dynamics, STAGE enables accurate prediction of future morphologies based on earlier representations.

A Study of Synthetic Experiments", "comment": "25 pages, 23 figures", "summary": "Chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning generated by large language models (LLMs) is often unfaithful: intermediate steps can be logically inconsistent or fail to reflect the causal relationship leading to the final answer. Despite extensive empirical observations, a fundamental understanding of CoT is lacking--what constitutes faithful CoT reasoning, and how unfaithfulness emerges from autoregressive training. We study these questions using well-controlled synthetic experiments, training small transformers on noisy data to solve modular arithmetic expressions step by step, a task we term Arithmetic Expression Reasoning. We find that models can learn faithful reasoning that causally follows the underlying arithmetic rules, but only when the training noise is below a critical threshold, a phenomenon attributable to simplicity bias. At higher noise levels, training dynamics exhibit a transition from faithful stepwise reasoning to unfaithful skip-step reasoning via an intermediate mixed mode characterized by a transient increase in prediction entropy. Mechanistic analysis reveals that models learn to encode internal uncertainty by resolving inconsistent reasoning steps, which suggests the emergence of implicit self-verification from autoregressive training.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u901a\u8fc7\u53d7\u63a7\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7814\u7a76\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u5fe0\u5b9e\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u566a\u58f0\u4f4e\u4e8e\u4e34\u754c\u9608\u503c\u65f6\u80fd\u5b66\u4e60\u5fe0\u5b9e\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u9ad8\u4e8e\u9608\u503c\u65f6\u5219\u8f6c\u5411\u4e0d\u5fe0\u5b9e\u7684\u8df3\u8dc3\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u5e76\u89c2\u5bdf\u5230\u9690\u542b\u7684\u81ea\u9a8c\u8bc1\u673a\u5236\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u751f\u6210\u7684\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u63a8\u7406\u5b58\u5728\u4e0d\u5fe0\u5b9e\u95ee\u9898\uff08\u4e2d\u95f4\u6b65\u9aa4\u903b\u8f91\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u6216\u672a\u80fd\u53cd\u6620\u6700\u7ec8\u7b54\u6848\u7684\u56e0\u679c\u5173\u7cfb\uff09\uff0c\u4f46\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u5fe0\u5b9e\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u6784\u6210\u4ee5\u53ca\u4e0d\u5fe0\u5b9e\u6027\u5982\u4f55\u4ece\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u4ea7\u751f\u7684\u6839\u672c\u7406\u89e3\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u53d7\u63a7\u5408\u6210\u5b9e\u9a8c\uff0c\u5728\u566a\u58f0\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u5c0f\u578bTransformer\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u8ba9\u5b83\u4eec\u9010\u6b65\u89e3\u51b3\u6a21\u5757\u5316\u7b97\u672f\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\uff08\u79f0\u4e3a\u7b97\u672f\u8868\u8fbe\u5f0f\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\uff09\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u8bad\u7ec3\u52a8\u6001\u548c\u673a\u5236\u3002", "result": "\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u566a\u58f0\u4f4e\u4e8e\u4e34\u754c\u9608\u503c\u65f6\u80fd\u5b66\u4e60\u5fe0\u5b9e\u63a8\u7406\uff08\u56e0\u679c\u9075\u5faa\u5e95\u5c42\u7b97\u672f\u89c4\u5219\uff09\uff0c\u9ad8\u4e8e\u9608\u503c\u65f6\u8f6c\u5411\u4e0d\u5fe0\u5b9e\u7684\u8df3\u8dc3\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u4e2d\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u6df7\u5408\u6a21\u5f0f\u4f34\u968f\u9884\u6d4b\u71b5\u7684\u77ac\u65f6\u589e\u52a0\uff1b\u673a\u5236\u5206\u6790\u663e\u793a\u6a21\u578b\u901a\u8fc7\u89e3\u51b3\u4e0d\u4e00\u81f4\u63a8\u7406\u6b65\u9aa4\u6765\u7f16\u7801\u5185\u90e8\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\uff0c\u8868\u660e\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u51fa\u73b0\u4e86\u9690\u542b\u7684\u81ea\u9a8c\u8bc1\u673a\u5236\u3002", "conclusion": "\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u5fe0\u5b9e\u6027\u53d7\u8bad\u7ec3\u566a\u58f0\u6c34\u5e73\u5f71\u54cd\uff0c\u5b58\u5728\u4e34\u754c\u9608\u503c\uff1b\u6a21\u578b\u80fd\u4ece\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u53d1\u5c55\u51fa\u9690\u542b\u7684\u81ea\u9a8c\u8bc1\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e3a\u7406\u89e3\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u5fe0\u5b9e\u6027\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u673a\u5236\u6027\u89c1\u89e3\u3002"}}

By modeling exploration via guided diffusion, multi-step denoising distributes stochasticity and preserves multiple coexisting solution modes without mutual suppression. Furthermore, by decoupling latent-space exploration from text-space generation, we show that latent diffusion-based optimization is more effective than text-space policy optimization alone, while a complementary text policy provides additional gains when combined with latent exploration. Experiments on code generation and mathematical reasoning benchmarks demonstrate consistent improvements in both pass@1 and pass@k over discrete RL baselines, with absolute pass@1 gains of +9.4% on code generation and +5.7% on mathematical reasoning, highlighting diffusion-based latent RL as a principled alternative to discrete token-level RL for reasoning.", "AI": {"tldr": "LaDi-RL\uff1a\u4e00\u79cd\u5728\u8fde\u7eed\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u63a2\u7d22\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5bfc\u6269\u6563\u5efa\u6a21\u63a2\u7d22\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u79bb\u6563RL\u4e2dCoT\u751f\u6210\u7684\u591a\u6837\u6027\u5d29\u6e83\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u548c\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u663e\u8457\u4f18\u4e8e\u79bb\u6563RL\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u8fc7\u4f18\u5316\u79bb\u6563\u7684\u601d\u7ef4\u94fe\u751f\u6210\u6765\u6539\u8fdbLLM\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u4ee4\u724c\u7a7a\u95f4\u7684\u63a2\u7d22\u5e38\u56e0\u7b56\u7565\u71b5\u964d\u4f4e\u548c\u6a21\u5f0f\u6fc0\u53d1\u884c\u4e3a\u5bfc\u81f4\u591a\u6837\u6027\u5d29\u6e83\u3002\u9700\u8981\u4e00\u79cd\u80fd\u4fdd\u6301\u591a\u79cd\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u6a21\u5f0f\u5171\u5b58\u800c\u4e0d\u76f8\u4e92\u6291\u5236\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faLaDi-RL\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u8fde\u7eed\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u8fdb\u884c\u63a2\u7d22\uff0c\u6f5c\u5728\u53d8\u91cf\u7f16\u7801\u8bed\u4e49\u7ea7\u63a8\u7406\u8f68\u8ff9\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u5f15\u5bfc\u6269\u6563\u5efa\u6a21\u63a2\u7d22\uff0c\u591a\u6b65\u53bb\u566a\u5206\u5e03\u968f\u673a\u6027\u5e76\u4fdd\u6301\u591a\u4e2a\u5171\u5b58\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u6a21\u5f0f\u3002\u5c06\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a2\u7d22\u4e0e\u6587\u672c\u7a7a\u95f4\u751f\u6210\u89e3\u8026\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u6587\u672c\u7b56\u7565\u83b7\u5f97\u989d\u5916\u6536\u76ca\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u548c\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u76f8\u6bd4\u79bb\u6563RL\u57fa\u7ebf\uff0c\u5728pass@1\u548cpass@k\u6307\u6807\u4e0a\u5747\u53d6\u5f97\u4e00\u81f4\u6539\u8fdb\u3002\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210pass@1\u7edd\u5bf9\u63d0\u5347+9.4%\uff0c\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406pass@1\u7edd\u5bf9\u63d0\u5347+5.7%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u57fa\u4e8e\u6269\u6563\u7684\u6f5c\u5728RL\u4e3a\u79bb\u6563\u4ee4\u724c\u7ea7RL\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u539f\u5219\u6027\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8fde\u7eed\u6f5c\u5728\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a2\u7d22\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u591a\u6837\u6027\u5d29\u6e83\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

As the context extends, the expressive capacity of such an $N$-width MLP increases, but scaling its fast weights becomes prohibitively expensive for extremely long sequences. Recently, this fast-weight scaling perspective has motivated the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) attention, which partitions the sequence into fast-weight experts and sparsely routes the tokens to them. In this paper, we elevate this perspective to a unifying framework for a wide range of efficient attention methods by interpreting them as scaling fast weights through routing and/or compression. Then we propose a compress-and-route strategy, which compresses the $N$-width MLP into a narrower one using a small set of landmark queries and constructs deformable experts by gathering top-$k$ activated key-value pairs for each landmark query.

However, in real-world service-oriented deployments, data generated by heterogeneous users, devices, and application scenarios are inherently non-IID. This severe data heterogeneity critically undermines the convergence stability, generalization ability, and ultimately the quality of service delivered by the global model. To address this challenge, we propose FLood, a novel FL framework inspired by out-of-distribution (OOD) detection. FLood dynamically counteracts the adverse effects of heterogeneity through a dual-weighting mechanism that jointly governs local training and global aggregation. At the client level, it adaptively reweights the supervised loss by upweighting pseudo-OOD samples, thereby encouraging more robust learning from distributionally misaligned or challenging data. At the server level, it refines model aggregation by weighting client contributions according to their OOD confidence scores, prioritizing updates from clients with higher in-distribution consistency and enhancing the global model's robustness and convergence stability. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks under diverse non-IID settings demonstrate that FLood consistently outperforms state-of-the-art FL methods in both accuracy and generalization. Furthermore, FLood functions as an orthogonal plug-in module: it seamlessly integrates with existing FL algorithms to boost their performance under heterogeneity without modifying their core optimization logic.

This omission eliminates \\emph{global competition}, a critical mechanism that enables models to sharply focus on relevant information amidst long-context noise. In this work, we propose \\textbf{Softmax Linear Attention (SLA)}, a framework designed to restore this competitive selection without sacrificing efficiency. By lifting the softmax operation from the token level to the head level, SLA leverages attention heads as coarse semantic slots, applying a competitive gating mechanism to dynamically select the most relevant subspaces. This reintroduces the ``winner-take-all'' dynamics essential for precise retrieval and robust long-context understanding. Distinct from prior methods that focus on refining local kernel functions, SLA adopts a broader perspective by exploiting the higher-level multi-head aggregation structure. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SLA consistently enhances state-of-the-art linear baselines (RetNet, GLA, GDN) across language modeling and long-context benchmarks, particularly in challenging retrieval scenarios where it significantly boosts robustness against noise, validating its capability to restore precise focus while maintaining linear complexity.", "AI": {"tldr": "SLA\uff08Softmax Linear Attention\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06softmax\u64cd\u4f5c\u4ecetoken\u7ea7\u522b\u63d0\u5347\u5230head\u7ea7\u522b\uff0c\u5728\u7ebf\u6027\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u4e2d\u6062\u590d\u4e86\u5168\u5c40\u7ade\u4e89\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u7ebf\u6027\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\u3002", "motivation": "\u7ebf\u6027\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u867d\u7136\u5c06\u6807\u51c6Transformer\u7684\u4e8c\u6b21\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u964d\u4f4e\u5230\u7ebf\u6027\u65f6\u95f4\uff0c\u4f46\u7531\u4e8e\u79fb\u9664\u4e86softmax\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5931\u53bb\u4e86\u5168\u5c40\u7ade\u4e89\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u8fd9\u4f7f\u5f97\u6a21\u578b\u96be\u4ee5\u5728\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u566a\u58f0\u4e2d\u805a\u7126\u76f8\u5173\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSoftmax Linear Attention\uff08SLA\uff09\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06softmax\u64cd\u4f5c\u4ecetoken\u7ea7\u522b\u63d0\u5347\u5230head\u7ea7\u522b\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5934\u4f5c\u4e3a\u7c97\u7c92\u5ea6\u8bed\u4e49\u69fd\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7ade\u4e89\u95e8\u63a7\u673a\u5236\u52a8\u6001\u9009\u62e9\u6700\u76f8\u5173\u7684\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\uff0c\u6062\u590d\"\u8d62\u8005\u901a\u5403\"\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u7279\u6027\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u8bed\u8a00\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cSLA\u6301\u7eed\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u7ebf\u6027\u57fa\u7ebf\u6a21\u578b\uff08RetNet\u3001GLA\u3001GDN\uff09\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u5177\u6709\u6311\u6218\u6027\u7684\u68c0\u7d22\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u589e\u5f3a\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u566a\u58f0\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "SLA\u901a\u8fc7\u5229\u7528\u66f4\u9ad8\u5c42\u6b21\u7684\u591a\u5934\u805a\u5408\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u5728\u7ebf\u6027\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u4e2d\u6062\u590d\u4e86\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u7ade\u4e89\u9009\u62e9\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u7ebf\u6027\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u957f\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u7406\u89e3\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u566a\u58f0\u73af\u5883\u4e0b\u7684\u68c0\u7d22\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u8272\u3002"}}

Unfortunately, their practical deployment is limited by slow inference speed, high memory usage, and the computational demands of the noise estimation process. Post-training quantization (PTQ) emerges as a promising solution to accelerate sampling and reduce memory overhead for diffusion models. Existing PTQ methods for diffusion models typically apply uniform weights to calibration samples across timesteps, which is sub-optimal since data at different timesteps may contribute differently to the diffusion process. Additionally, due to varying activation distributions and gradients across timesteps, a uniform quantization approach is sub-optimal. Each timestep requires a different gradient direction for optimal quantization, and treating them equally can lead to conflicting gradients that degrade performance. In this paper, we propose a novel PTQ method that addresses these challenges by assigning appropriate weights to calibration samples. Specifically, our approach learns to assign optimal weights to calibration samples to align the quantized model's gradients across timesteps, facilitating the quantization process. Extensive experiments on CIFAR-10, LSUN-Bedrooms, and ImageNet demonstrate the superiority of our method compared to other PTQ methods for diffusion models.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u9488\u5bf9\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u65b0\u578b\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b66\u4e60\u4e3a\u4e0d\u540c\u65f6\u95f4\u6b65\u7684\u6821\u51c6\u6837\u672c\u5206\u914d\u6700\u4f18\u6743\u91cd\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e2d\u5747\u5300\u6743\u91cd\u5206\u914d\u548c\u68af\u5ea6\u51b2\u7a81\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u91cf\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u90e8\u7f72\u4e2d\u5b58\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u6162\u3001\u5185\u5b58\u5360\u7528\u9ad8\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u9700\u6c42\u5927\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u5bf9\u6240\u6709\u65f6\u95f4\u6b65\u7684\u6821\u51c6\u6837\u672c\u4f7f\u7528\u5747\u5300\u6743\u91cd\uff0c\u8fd9\u662f\u6b21\u4f18\u7684\uff0c\u56e0\u4e3a\u4e0d\u540c\u65f6\u95f4\u6b65\u7684\u6570\u636e\u5bf9\u6269\u6563\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u8d21\u732e\u4e0d\u540c\uff0c\u4e14\u6fc0\u6d3b\u5206\u5e03\u548c\u68af\u5ea6\u53d8\u5316\u5bfc\u81f4\u5747\u5300\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u6548\u679c\u4e0d\u4f73\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5b66\u4e60\u4e3a\u6821\u51c6\u6837\u672c\u5206\u914d\u6700\u4f18\u6743\u91cd\uff0c\u4f7f\u91cf\u5316\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u65f6\u95f4\u6b65\u7684\u68af\u5ea6\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u4ece\u800c\u4f18\u5316\u91cf\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u8003\u8651\u4e86\u4e0d\u540c\u65f6\u95f4\u6b65\u5bf9\u6269\u6563\u8fc7\u7a0b\u7684\u4e0d\u540c\u8d21\u732e\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u68af\u5ea6\u51b2\u7a81\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "result": "\u5728CIFAR-10\u3001LSUN-Bedrooms\u548cImageNet\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u4e0a\u7684\u5927\u91cf\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u76f8\u6bd4\u5176\u4ed6\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u5177\u6709\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5b66\u4e60\u4e3a\u4e0d\u540c\u65f6\u95f4\u6b65\u7684\u6821\u51c6\u6837\u672c\u5206\u914d\u6700\u4f18\u6743\u91cd\u6765\u5bf9\u9f50\u68af\u5ea6\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u91cf\u5316\u4e2d\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u91cf\u5316\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u90e8\u7f72\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

RankTuner introduces a probability--entropy calibration signal, the Relative Rank Indicator, which compares the rank of the ground-truth token with its expected rank under the prediction distribution. The inverse indicator is used as a token-wise Relative Scale to reweight the fine-tuning objective, focusing updates on truly under-learned tokens without over-penalizing intrinsically uncertain positions. Experiments on multiple backbones show consistent improvements on mathematical reasoning benchmarks, transfer gains on out-of-distribution reasoning, and pre code generation performance over probability-only or entropy-only reweighting baselines.", "AI": {"tldr": "RankTuner\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u6982\u7387-\u71b5\u6821\u51c6\u7684token\u7ea7\u91cd\u52a0\u6743\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u76f8\u5bf9\u79e9\u6307\u6807\u8bc6\u522b\u771f\u6b63\u9700\u8981\u5b66\u4e60\u7684token\uff0c\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u548c\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u4ec5\u57fa\u4e8e\u6982\u7387\u6216\u71b5\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u7684token\u7ea7\u91cd\u52a0\u6743\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e00\u7ef4\u6307\u6807\uff1a\u771f\u5b9e\u6982\u7387\u53cd\u6620\u4e0b\u6e38\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0ctoken\u71b5\u53cd\u6620\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u5148\u9a8c\u7684\u5185\u5728\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u3002\u5ffd\u7565\u71b5\u4f1a\u8bef\u5c06\u566a\u58f0\u6216\u6613\u66ff\u6362token\u8bc6\u522b\u4e3a\u5b66\u4e60\u5173\u952e\uff0c\u800c\u5ffd\u7565\u6982\u7387\u5219\u65e0\u6cd5\u53cd\u6620\u76ee\u6807\u7279\u5b9a\u5bf9\u9f50\u3002", "method": "RankTuner\u5f15\u5165\u4e86\u6982\u7387-\u71b5\u6821\u51c6\u4fe1\u53f7\u2014\u2014\u76f8\u5bf9\u79e9\u6307\u6807\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u771f\u5b9etoken\u7684\u79e9\u4e0e\u5176\u5728\u9884\u6d4b\u5206\u5e03\u4e0b\u7684\u671f\u671b\u79e9\u3002\u5176\u5012\u6570\u4f5c\u4e3atoken\u7ea7\u76f8\u5bf9\u5c3a\u5ea6\u6765\u91cd\u52a0\u6743\u5fae\u8c03\u76ee\u6807\uff0c\u4e13\u6ce8\u4e8e\u771f\u6b63\u672a\u5145\u5206\u5b66\u4e60\u7684token\uff0c\u4e0d\u8fc7\u5ea6\u60e9\u7f5a\u5185\u5728\u4e0d\u786e\u5b9a\u7684\u4f4d\u7f6e\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u9aa8\u5e72\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u6570\u5b66\u63a8\u7406\u57fa\u51c6\u4e0a\u53d6\u5f97\u4e00\u81f4\u6539\u8fdb\uff0c\u5728\u5206\u5e03\u5916\u63a8\u7406\u4e0a\u83b7\u5f97\u8fc1\u79fb\u589e\u76ca\uff0c\u5728\u4ee3\u7801\u751f\u6210\u6027\u80fd\u4e0a\u4f18\u4e8e\u4ec5\u57fa\u4e8e\u6982\u7387\u6216\u71b5\u7684\u91cd\u52a0\u6743\u57fa\u7ebf\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6982\u7387-\u71b5\u6821\u51c6\u7684\u76f8\u5bf9\u79e9\u6307\u6807\u80fd\u66f4\u51c6\u786e\u5730\u8bc6\u522b\u9700\u8981\u5b66\u4e60\u7684token\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u7684\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u4e00\u7ef4\u91cd\u52a0\u6743\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002"}}

Existing approaches regularize representations towards isotropic Gaussian distributions, but inherently favor dense representations and fail to capture the key property of sparsity observed in efficient representations.

RGG enables explicit control over expected $\\ell_0$ norm through rectification, while preserving maximum-entropy up to rescaling under expected $\\ell_p$ norm constraints.

However, SFT is often optimized in isolation to maximize SFT performance alone.\n  We show that, after identical RL training, models initialized from stronger SFT checkpoints can significantly underperform those initialized from weaker ones. We attribute this to a mismatch typical in current SFT-RL pipelines: the distribution that generates the offline SFT data can differ substantially from the policy optimized during online RL, which learns from its own rollouts.\n  We propose PEAR (Policy Evaluation-inspired Algorithm for Offline Learning Loss Re-weighting), an SFT-stage method that corrects this mismatch and better prepares the model for RL. PEAR uses importance sampling to reweight the SFT loss, with three variants operating at the token, block, and sequence levels. It can be used to augment standard SFT objectives and incurs little additional training overhead once probabilities for the offline data are collected.\n  We conduct controlled experiments on verifiable reasoning games and mathematical reasoning tasks on Qwen 2.5 and 3 and DeepSeek-distilled models.

To address this, we propose a principled framework that models sequential scaling as a two-state Markov process. This approach reveals the underlying properties of sequential scaling and yields closed-form solutions for essential aspects, such as the specific conditions under which accuracy is improved and the theoretical upper, neutral, and lower performance bounds. Leveraging this formulation, we develop MarkovScale, a practical system that applies these optimality criteria to achieve a theoretically grounded balance between accuracy and efficiency. Comprehensive experiments across 3 backbone LLMs, 5 benchmarks, and over 20 configurations show that MarkovScale consistently outperforms state-of-the-art parallel and sequential scaling methods, representing a significant step toward optimal and resource-efficient inference in LLMs. The source code will be open upon acceptance at https://open-upon-acceptance.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51faMarkovScale\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u5e8f\u5217\u7f29\u653e\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u4e24\u72b6\u6001\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u7406\u8bba\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u8fb9\u754c\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u5e76\u884c\u548c\u5e8f\u5217\u7f29\u653e\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "motivation": "\u5e8f\u5217\u7f29\u653e\u4f5c\u4e3a\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u7f29\u653e\u8303\u5f0f\uff0c\u5176\u6027\u80fd\u6539\u8fdb\u901a\u5e38\u6709\u9650\u4e14\u7f3a\u4e4f\u7406\u8bba\u7406\u89e3\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u539f\u56e0\u662f\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u591a\u4e3a\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u3001\u975e\u539f\u5219\u6027\u7684\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u6e05\u6670\u7684\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u8fb9\u754c\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u539f\u5219\u6027\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u5e8f\u5217\u7f29\u653e\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u4e24\u72b6\u6001\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u63a8\u5bfc\u51fa\u95ed\u5f0f\u89e3\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u7684\u5177\u4f53\u6761\u4ef6\u4ee5\u53ca\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u9650\u3001\u4e2d\u6027\u548c\u4e0b\u9650\u6027\u80fd\u8fb9\u754c\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\u5f00\u53d1MarkovScale\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u5e94\u7528\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u51c6\u5219\u5b9e\u73b0\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4e0e\u6548\u7387\u7684\u7406\u8bba\u5e73\u8861\u3002", "result": "\u57283\u4e2a\u9aa8\u5e72LLM\u30015\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u548c\u8d85\u8fc720\u79cd\u914d\u7f6e\u7684\u5168\u9762\u5b9e\u9a8c\u4e2d\uff0cMarkovScale\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8e\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u5e76\u884c\u548c\u5e8f\u5217\u7f29\u653e\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4ee3\u8868\u4e86\u5411LLM\u6700\u4f18\u548c\u8d44\u6e90\u9ad8\u6548\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u91cd\u8981\u8fdb\u5c55\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u5c06\u5e8f\u5217\u7f29\u653e\u5efa\u6a21\u4e3a\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u6700\u4f18\u6027\u8fb9\u754c\uff0c\u5f00\u53d1\u51fa\u5728\u5b9e\u8df5\u4e2d\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684MarkovScale\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u63a8\u52a8\u4e86LLM\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u548c\u8d44\u6e90\u6548\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u3002"}}

While Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) is a key alignment framework, existing approaches often rely heavily on costly external evaluators for scoring or rewriting, incurring off-policy learnability gaps and discretization loss. Due to the lack of access to internal states, such feedback overlooks the fine-grained conflicts between different modalities that lead to hallucinations during generation.\n  To address this issue, we propose IRIS (Implicit Reward-Guided Internal Sifting), which leverages continuous implicit rewards in the native log-probability space to preserve full information density and capture internal modal competition. This on-policy paradigm eliminates learnability gaps by utilizing self-generated preference pairs. By sifting these pairs based on multimodal implicit rewards, IRIS ensures that optimization is driven by signals that directly resolve modal conflicts. Extensive experiments demonstrate that IRIS achieves highly competitive performance on key hallucination benchmarks using only 5.7k samples, without requiring any external feedback during preference alignment.

While deep learning (DL) has been increasingly adopted in EPF to capture complex and nonlinear price dynamics, several important gaps persist: (i) limited attention to multi-day horizons beyond day-ahead forecasting, (ii) insufficient exploration of state-of-the-art (SOTA) time series DL models, and (iii) a predominant reliance on aggregated horizon-level evaluation that obscures time-of-day forecasting variation. To address these gaps, we propose a novel EPF framework that extends the forecast horizon to multi-day-ahead by systematically building forecasting models that leverage benchmarked SOTA time series DL models. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation to analyse time-of-day forecasting performance by integrating model assessment at intraday interval levels across all five regions in the Australian National Electricity Market (NEM). The results show that no single model consistently dominates across regions, metrics, and horizons. Overall, standard DL models deliver superior performance in most regions, while SOTA time series DL models demonstrate greater robustness to forecast horizon extension. Intraday interval-level evaluation reveals pronounced diurnal error patterns, indicating that absolute errors peak during the evening ramp, relative errors inflate during midday negative-price regimes, and directional accuracy degrades during periods of frequent trend changes. These findings suggest that future research on DL-based EPF can benefit from enriched feature representations and modelling strategies that enhance longer-term forecasting robustness while maintaining sensitivity to intraday volatility and structural price dynamics.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u4e2a\u591a\u65e5\u524d\u7535\u4ef7\u9884\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u65f6\u5e8f\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5728\u6fb3\u5927\u5229\u4e9a\u7535\u529b\u5e02\u573a\u8fdb\u884c\u7efc\u5408\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6807\u51c6\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u6570\u533a\u57df\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff0c\u800c\u5148\u8fdb\u65f6\u5e8f\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u9884\u6d4b\u5468\u671f\u6269\u5c55\u66f4\u5177\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u524d\u7535\u4ef7\u9884\u6d4b\u5b58\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u4e3b\u8981\u95ee\u9898\uff1a1) \u591a\u65e5\u9884\u6d4b\u7814\u7a76\u6709\u9650\uff1b2) \u5bf9\u5148\u8fdb\u65f6\u5e8f\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u63a2\u7d22\u4e0d\u8db3\uff1b3) \u4f9d\u8d56\u805a\u5408\u8bc4\u4f30\u63a9\u76d6\u4e86\u65e5\u5185\u9884\u6d4b\u5dee\u5f02\u3002\u9700\u8981\u89e3\u51b3\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7f3a\u53e3\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u7535\u4ef7\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u65b0\u9896\u7684\u7535\u4ef7\u9884\u6d4b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5c06\u9884\u6d4b\u5468\u671f\u6269\u5c55\u5230\u591a\u65e5\u524d\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u6784\u5efa\u57fa\u4e8e\u5148\u8fdb\u65f6\u5e8f\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u5728\u6fb3\u5927\u5229\u4e9a\u56fd\u5bb6\u7535\u529b\u5e02\u573a\u4e94\u4e2a\u533a\u57df\u8fdb\u884c\u7efc\u5408\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u65e5\u5185\u65f6\u6bb5\u7ea7\u522b\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "result": "\u7ed3\u679c\u663e\u793a\uff1a1) \u6ca1\u6709\u5355\u4e00\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u6240\u6709\u533a\u57df\u3001\u6307\u6807\u548c\u9884\u6d4b\u5468\u671f\u4e0a\u6301\u7eed\u5360\u4f18\uff1b2) \u6807\u51c6\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u591a\u6570\u533a\u57df\u8868\u73b0\u6700\u4f73\uff1b3) \u5148\u8fdb\u65f6\u5e8f\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u9884\u6d4b\u5468\u671f\u6269\u5c55\u66f4\u5177\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff1b4) \u65e5\u5185\u8bc4\u4f30\u63ed\u793a\u660e\u663e\u7684\u663c\u591c\u8bef\u5dee\u6a21\u5f0f\uff1a\u7edd\u5bf9\u8bef\u5dee\u5728\u665a\u95f4\u722c\u5761\u671f\u8fbe\u5230\u5cf0\u503c\uff0c\u76f8\u5bf9\u8bef\u5dee\u5728\u5348\u95f4\u8d1f\u7535\u4ef7\u671f\u95f4\u81a8\u80c0\uff0c\u65b9\u5411\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u5728\u8d8b\u52bf\u9891\u7e41\u53d8\u5316\u671f\u95f4\u4e0b\u964d\u3002", "conclusion": "\u672a\u6765\u57fa\u4e8e\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u7535\u4ef7\u9884\u6d4b\u7814\u7a76\u53ef\u4ee5\u4ece\u4e30\u5bcc\u7684\u7279\u5f81\u8868\u793a\u548c\u5efa\u6a21\u7b56\u7565\u4e2d\u53d7\u76ca\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u7b56\u7565\u5e94\u589e\u5f3a\u957f\u671f\u9884\u6d4b\u7684\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u5bf9\u65e5\u5185\u6ce2\u52a8\u6027\u548c\u7ed3\u6784\u6027\u4ef7\u683c\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6027\u3002"}}

Moreover, to improve geometric consistency, we introduce a Boundary Cross-Attention (BCA) module that enables conditioning on building boundaries. Our experiments show that BCA significantly improves boundary adherence, while prolonged training drives diversity collapse undiagnosed by FID, revealing a critical trade-off between realism and diversity.

Moreover, existing methods often lack targeted design and fail to address two fundamental challenges in continual PET: how to allocate expert parameters to evolving data distributions, and how to improve their representational capacity under limited supervision. Inspired by the fruit fly's hierarchical memory system characterized by sparse expansion and modular ensembles, we propose FlyPrompt, a brain-inspired framework that decomposes GCL into two subproblems: expert routing and expert competence improvement. FlyPrompt introduces a randomly expanded analytic router for instance-level expert activation and a temporal ensemble of output heads to dynamically adapt decision boundaries over time. Extensive theoretical and empirical evaluations demonstrate FlyPrompt's superior performance, achieving up to 11.23%, 12.43%, and 7.62% gains over state-of-the-art baselines on CIFAR-100, ImageNet-R, and CUB-200, respectively.

In contrast, one-shot federated learning (OFL) alleviates these limitations by reducing communication to a single round, thereby lowering overhead and enhancing practical deployability. Nevertheless, most existing one-shot approaches remain either impractical or constrained, for example, they often depend on the availability of a public dataset, assume homogeneous client models, or require uploading additional data or model information. To overcome these issues, we introduce the Gaussian-Head OFL (GH-OFL) family, a suite of one-shot federated methods that assume class-conditional Gaussianity of pretrained embeddings. Clients transmit only sufficient statistics (per-class counts and first/second-order moments) and the server builds heads via three components: (i) Closed-form Gaussian heads (NB/LDA/QDA) computed directly from the received statistics; (ii) FisherMix, a linear head with cosine margin trained on synthetic samples drawn in an estimated Fisher subspace; and (iii) Proto-Hyper, a lightweight low-rank residual head that refines Gaussian logits via knowledge distillation on those synthetic samples.

Amintoosi"], "title": "Stein-Rule Shrinkage for Stochastic Gradient Estimation in High Dimensions", "comment": null, "summary": "Stochastic gradient methods are central to large-scale learning, yet their analysis typically treats mini-batch gradients as unbiased estimators of the population gradient. In high-dimensional settings, however, classical results from statistical decision theory show that unbiased estimators are generally inadmissible under quadratic loss, suggesting that standard stochastic gradients may be suboptimal from a risk perspective. In this work, we formulate stochastic gradient computation as a high-dimensional estimation problem and introduce a decision-theoretic framework based on Stein-rule shrinkage. We construct a shrinkage gradient estimator that adaptively contracts noisy mini-batch gradients toward a stable restricted estimator derived from historical momentum. The shrinkage intensity is determined in a data-driven manner using an online estimate of gradient noise variance, leveraging second-moment statistics commonly maintained by adaptive optimization methods. Under a Gaussian noise model and for dimension p>=3, we show that the proposed estimator uniformly dominates the standard stochastic gradient under squared error loss and is minimax-optimal in the classical decision-theoretic sense. We further demonstrate how this estimator can be incorporated into the Adam optimizer, yielding a practical algorithm with negligible additional computational cost. Empirical evaluations on CIFAR10 and CIFAR100, across multiple levels of label noise, show consistent improvements over Adam in the large-batch regime. Ablation studies indicate that the gains arise primarily from selectively applying shrinkage to high-dimensional convolutional layers, while indiscriminate shrinkage across all parameters degrades performance. These results illustrate that classical shrinkage principles provide a principled and effective approach to improving stochastic gradient estimation in modern deep learning.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8eStein\u89c4\u5219\u6536\u7f29\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6536\u7f29\u566a\u58f0\u7684\u5c0f\u6279\u91cf\u68af\u5ea6\u5411\u5386\u53f2\u52a8\u91cf\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\uff0c\u5728p\u22653\u7684\u9ad8\u7ef4\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u8be5\u6536\u7f29\u68af\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u5728\u5e73\u65b9\u8bef\u5dee\u635f\u5931\u4e0b\u4e00\u81f4\u4f18\u4e8e\u6807\u51c6\u968f\u673a\u68af\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u53ef\u4ee5\u65e0\u7f1d\u96c6\u6210\u5230Adam\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u4e2d\u3002", "motivation": "\u968f\u673a\u68af\u5ea6\u65b9\u6cd5\u662f\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\uff0c\u4f46\u4f20\u7edf\u5206\u6790\u5c06\u5c0f\u6279\u91cf\u68af\u5ea6\u89c6\u4e3a\u603b\u4f53\u68af\u5ea6\u7684\u65e0\u504f\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u3002\u5728\u9ad8\u7ef4\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e2d\uff0c\u7edf\u8ba1\u51b3\u7b56\u7406\u8bba\u7684\u7ecf\u5178\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u5728\u4e8c\u6b21\u635f\u5931\u4e0b\u65e0\u504f\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u901a\u5e38\u662f\u4e0d\u5bb9\u8bb8\u7684\uff0c\u8fd9\u8868\u660e\u6807\u51c6\u968f\u673a\u68af\u5ea6\u4ece\u98ce\u9669\u89d2\u5ea6\u53ef\u80fd\u662f\u6b21\u4f18\u7684\u3002", "method": "\u5c06\u968f\u673a\u68af\u5ea6\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\u4e3a\u9ad8\u7ef4\u4f30\u8ba1\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5f15\u5165\u57fa\u4e8eStein\u89c4\u5219\u6536\u7f29\u7684\u51b3\u7b56\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\u3002\u6784\u5efa\u6536\u7f29\u68af\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\uff0c\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u5730\u5c06\u566a\u58f0\u5c0f\u6279\u91cf\u68af\u5ea6\u6536\u7f29\u5230\u4ece\u5386\u53f2\u52a8\u91cf\u5bfc\u51fa\u7684\u7a33\u5b9a\u53d7\u9650\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u3002\u6536\u7f29\u5f3a\u5ea6\u4f7f\u7528\u68af\u5ea6\u566a\u58f0\u65b9\u5dee\u7684\u5728\u7ebf\u4f30\u8ba1\u4ee5\u6570\u636e\u9a71\u52a8\u65b9\u5f0f\u786e\u5b9a\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u901a\u5e38\u7ef4\u62a4\u7684\u4e8c\u9636\u77e9\u7edf\u8ba1\u91cf\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u9ad8\u65af\u566a\u58f0\u6a21\u578b\u4e0b\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u7ef4\u5ea6p\u22653\uff0c\u6240\u63d0\u51fa\u7684\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u5728\u5e73\u65b9\u8bef\u5dee\u635f\u5931\u4e0b\u4e00\u81f4\u4f18\u4e8e\u6807\u51c6\u968f\u673a\u68af\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u5728\u7ecf\u5178\u51b3\u7b56\u7406\u8bba\u610f\u4e49\u4e0b\u662f\u6700\u5c0f\u6700\u5927\u6700\u4f18\u7684\u3002\u5c06\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u96c6\u6210\u5230Adam\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u4e2d\uff0c\u5728CIFAR10\u548cCIFAR100\u4e0a\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u6807\u7b7e\u566a\u58f0\u6c34\u5e73\u4e0b\uff0c\u5728\u5927\u6279\u91cf\u673a\u5236\u4e2d\u76f8\u6bd4Adam\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u6301\u7eed\u6539\u8fdb\u3002\u6d88\u878d\u7814\u7a76\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u589e\u76ca\u4e3b\u8981\u6765\u81ea\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u5730\u5bf9\u9ad8\u7ef4\u5377\u79ef\u5c42\u5e94\u7528\u6536\u7f29\uff0c\u800c\u8de8\u6240\u6709\u53c2\u6570\u7684\u65e0\u5dee\u522b\u6536\u7f29\u4f1a\u964d\u4f4e\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u7ecf\u5178\u6536\u7f29\u539f\u7406\u4e3a\u6539\u8fdb\u73b0\u4ee3\u6df1\u5ea6\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u968f\u673a\u68af\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u539f\u5219\u6027\u4e14\u6709\u6548\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u6536\u7f29\u68af\u5ea6\u4f30\u8ba1\u5668\u53ef\u4ee5\u65e0\u7f1d\u96c6\u6210\u5230\u73b0\u6709\u4f18\u5316\u5668\u4e2d\uff0c\u5e26\u6765\u6027\u80fd\u63d0\u5347\u800c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u53ef\u5ffd\u7565\u4e0d\u8ba1\u3002"}}

However, running world models rely on hevay computational cost and memory footprint, making model quantization essential for efficient deployment. To date, the effects of post-training quantization (PTQ) on world models remain largely unexamined. In this work, we present a systematic empirical study of world model quantization using DINO-WM as a representative case, evaluating diverse PTQ methods under both weight-only and joint weight-activation settings. We conduct extensive experiments on different visual planning tasks across a wide range of bit-widths, quantization granularities, and planning horizons up to 50 iterations. Our results show that quantization effects in world models extend beyond standard accuracy and bit-width trade-offs: group-wise weight quantization can stabilize low-bit rollouts, activation quantization granularity yields inconsistent benefits, and quantization sensitivity is highly asymmetric between encoder and predictor modules. Moreover, aggressive low-bit quantization significantly degrades the alignment between the planning objective and task success, leading to failures that cannot be remedied by additional optimization. These findings reveal distinct quantization-induced failure modes in world model-based planning and provide practical guidance for deploying quantized world models under strict computational constraints.

While such representations are intuitive for privacy, they pose challenges for machine learning, which typically treats non-original values as new categories or as missing, thereby discarding generalization semantics. For learning from such tabular data, we propose novel data transformation strategies that account for heterogeneous anonymization and evaluate them alongside standard imputation and LLM-based approaches.

Failing to filter these distractors causes LAMs to capture spurious correlations and build sub-optimal latent action spaces. In this paper, we introduce MaskLAM -- a lightweight modification to LAM training to mitigate this issue by incorporating visual agent segmentation. MaskLAM utilises segmentation masks from pretrained foundation models to weight the LAM reconstruction loss, thereby prioritising salient information over background elements while requiring no architectural modifications. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on continuous-control MuJoCo tasks, modified with action-correlated background noise.

While GaLore enables memory-efficient training by updating gradients in a low-rank subspace, it incurs a comparable extra training time cost due to the Singular Value Decomposition(SVD) process on gradients. In this paper, we propose Lotus, a method that resolves this trade-off by simply modifying the projection process. We propose a criterion that quantifies the displacement of the unit gradient to enable efficient transitions between low-rank gradient subspaces.

While recent studies attribute this to \"training inference mismatch stemming\" from inconsistent hybrid engines, standard remedies, such as Importance Sampling, might fail during extended training runs. In this work, we analyze this instability through the lens of optimization, demonstrating that gradient noise and training-inference mismatch escalate in tandem as training progresses. Meanwhile, we find that the mismatch can be effectively suppressed by shrinking the update size. Taken together, we deduce that the mismatch is not merely a static numerical discrepancy, but a dynamic failure coupled with the model's optimization. Based on this insight, we propose a simple yet effective solution: a specialized Learning Rate (LR) scheduler. Instead of pre-defined decay schedule in traditional LR scheduler, our method dynamically triggers LR decay based on response length, which we identify as a reliable early-warning signal for impending instability. Empirical evidence suggests that by reducing the learning rate as gradient noise rises, we can consistently stabilize RL training and keep the training-inference mismatch at a safe level.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u57fa\u4e8e\u54cd\u5e94\u957f\u5ea6\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u5b66\u4e60\u7387\u8c03\u5ea6\u5668\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u7a33\u5b9a\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u76d1\u6d4b\u68af\u5ea6\u566a\u58f0\u548c\u8bad\u7ec3-\u63a8\u7406\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u95ee\u9898\u6765\u9884\u9632\u8bad\u7ec3\u5d29\u6e83\u3002", "motivation": "\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3\u5b58\u5728\u4e25\u91cd\u7684\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4f20\u7edf\u65b9\u6cd5\u5982\u91cd\u8981\u6027\u91c7\u6837\u5728\u957f\u65f6\u95f4\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u53ef\u80fd\u5931\u6548\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\u8fd9\u79cd\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u6e90\u4e8e\u8bad\u7ec3-\u63a8\u7406\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u4e0e\u68af\u5ea6\u566a\u58f0\u7684\u534f\u540c\u6076\u5316\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u52a8\u6001\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u7b56\u7565\u6765\u89e3\u51b3\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u4e13\u95e8\u7684\u5b66\u4e60\u7387\u8c03\u5ea6\u5668\uff0c\u4e0d\u540c\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u9884\u5b9a\u4e49\u8870\u51cf\u8ba1\u5212\uff0c\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u57fa\u4e8e\u54cd\u5e94\u957f\u5ea6\u52a8\u6001\u89e6\u53d1\u5b66\u4e60\u7387\u8870\u51cf\u3002\u54cd\u5e94\u957f\u5ea6\u88ab\u8bc6\u522b\u4e3a\u5373\u5c06\u53d1\u751f\u4e0d\u7a33\u5b9a\u6027\u7684\u53ef\u9760\u65e9\u671f\u9884\u8b66\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5728\u5b66\u4e60\u7387\u8870\u51cf\u65f6\u964d\u4f4e\u68af\u5ea6\u566a\u58f0\uff0c\u4fdd\u6301\u8bad\u7ec3-\u63a8\u7406\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u5728\u5b89\u5168\u6c34\u5e73\u3002", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8bc1\u636e\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u54cd\u5e94\u957f\u5ea6\u76d1\u6d4b\u68af\u5ea6\u566a\u58f0\u4e0a\u5347\u5e76\u76f8\u5e94\u964d\u4f4e\u5b66\u4e60\u7387\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u6301\u7eed\u7a33\u5b9a\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u63a7\u5236\u8bad\u7ec3-\u63a8\u7406\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8bad\u7ec3-\u63a8\u7406\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\u4e0d\u662f\u9759\u6001\u6570\u503c\u5dee\u5f02\uff0c\u800c\u662f\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u4f18\u5316\u8026\u5408\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u6545\u969c\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u54cd\u5e94\u957f\u5ea6\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u5b66\u4e60\u7387\u8c03\u5ea6\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u7b80\u5355\u6709\u6548\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u7a33\u5b9a\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002"}}

In this work, we use mechanistic interpretability to causally investigate the internal representations of a neural speech decoder. We perform cross-mode activation patching of internal activations across speech modes, and use tri-modal interpolation to examine whether speech representations vary discretely or continuously. We use coarse-to-fine causal tracing and causal scrubbing to find localized causal structure, allowing us to find internal subspaces that are sufficient for cross-mode transfer. In order to determine how finely distributed these effects are within layers, we perform neuron-level activation patching. We discover that small but not distributed subsets of neurons, rather than isolated units, affect the cross-mode transfer. Our results show that speech modes lie on a shared continuous causal manifold, and cross-mode transfer is mediated by compact, layer-specific subspaces rather than diffuse activity.

This problem can be addressed by allowing limited online interactions to selectively refine uncertain regions of the learned value function, which is referred to as Active Reinforcement Learning (ActiveRL). While there has been good empirical success, no theoretical analysis is available in the literature. We fill this gap by developing a rigorous sample-complexity analysis of ActiveRL through the lens of Gaussian Process (GP) uncertainty modeling. In this respect, we propose an algorithm and using GP concentration inequalities and information-gain bounds, we derive high-probability guarantees showing that an $\u03b5$-optimal policy can be learned with ${\\mathcal{O}}(1/\u03b5^2)$ active transitions, improving upon the $\u03a9(1/\u03b5^2(1-\u03b3)^4)$ rate of purely offline methods.

In the review of current studies, earlier sequence methods treat cells as independent entities and adapt prevalent ML models to analyze their directly inherited sequence data. Despite their simplicity and intuition, these methods overlook the latent intercellular relationships driven by the functional mechanisms of biological systems and the inherent quality issues of the raw sequence data. Therefore, a series of structured methods has emerged. Although they employ various heuristic rules to capture intricate intercellular relationships and enhance the raw sequencing data, these methods often neglect biological prior knowledge. This omission incurs substantial overhead and yields suboptimal graph representations, thereby hindering the utility of ML models.\n  To address them, we propose DOGMA, a holistic data-centric framework designed for the structural reshaping and semantic enhancement of raw data through multi-level biological prior knowledge. Transcending reliance on stochastic heuristics, DOGMA redefines graph construction by integrating Statistical Anchors with Cell Ontology and Phylogenetic Trees to enable deterministic structure discovery and robust cross-species alignment. Furthermore, Gene Ontology is utilized to bridge the feature-level semantic gap by incorporating functional priors. In complex multi-species and multi-organ benchmarks, DOGMA achieves SOTA performance, exhibiting superior zero-shot robustness and sample efficiency while operating with significantly lower computational cost.", "AI": {"tldr": "DOGMA\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684AI\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u591a\u5c42\u6b21\u7684\u751f\u7269\u5b66\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\uff08\u7edf\u8ba1\u951a\u70b9\u3001\u7ec6\u80de\u672c\u4f53\u8bba\u3001\u7cfb\u7edf\u53d1\u80b2\u6811\u3001\u57fa\u56e0\u672c\u4f53\u8bba\uff09\u6765\u91cd\u6784\u5355\u7ec6\u80de\u8f6c\u5f55\u7ec4\u6570\u636e\u7684\u7ed3\u6784\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u53d1\u73b0\u548c\u8de8\u7269\u79cd\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u5728\u590d\u6742\u591a\u7269\u79cd\u591a\u5668\u5b98\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u8fbe\u5230SOTA\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5355\u7ec6\u80de\u8f6c\u5f55\u7ec4\u5206\u6790\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u4e24\u4e2a\u4e3b\u8981\u95ee\u9898\uff1a1\uff09\u65e9\u671f\u5e8f\u5217\u65b9\u6cd5\u5c06\u7ec6\u80de\u89c6\u4e3a\u72ec\u7acb\u5b9e\u4f53\uff0c\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u751f\u7269\u7cfb\u7edf\u529f\u80fd\u673a\u5236\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u6f5c\u5728\u7ec6\u80de\u95f4\u5173\u7cfb\uff1b2\uff09\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\u867d\u7136\u5c1d\u8bd5\u6355\u6349\u7ec6\u80de\u95f4\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u4f46\u4f9d\u8d56\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u89c4\u5219\u800c\u5ffd\u89c6\u4e86\u751f\u7269\u5b66\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u56fe\u8868\u793a\u8d28\u91cf\u4e0d\u4f73\u4e14\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u5927\u3002", "method": "DOGMA\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u6574\u4f53\u6027\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5fc3\u7684\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u5c42\u6b21\u7684\u751f\u7269\u5b66\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\u8fdb\u884c\u7ed3\u6784\u91cd\u5851\u548c\u8bed\u4e49\u589e\u5f3a\uff1a1\uff09\u6574\u5408\u7edf\u8ba1\u951a\u70b9\u3001\u7ec6\u80de\u672c\u4f53\u8bba\u548c\u7cfb\u7edf\u53d1\u80b2\u6811\u6765\u5b9e\u73b0\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u56fe\u7ed3\u6784\u53d1\u73b0\u548c\u9c81\u68d2\u7684\u8de8\u7269\u79cd\u5bf9\u9f50\uff1b2\uff09\u5229\u7528\u57fa\u56e0\u672c\u4f53\u8bba\u6765\u5f25\u5408\u7279\u5f81\u5c42\u9762\u7684\u8bed\u4e49\u9e3f\u6c9f\uff0c\u878d\u5165\u529f\u80fd\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u590d\u6742\u7684\u591a\u7269\u79cd\u548c\u591a\u5668\u5b98\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0cDOGMA\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u5353\u8d8a\u7684\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\u548c\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4ee5\u663e\u8457\u66f4\u4f4e\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u8fd0\u884c\u3002", "conclusion": "DOGMA\u901a\u8fc7\u6574\u5408\u591a\u5c42\u6b21\u7684\u751f\u7269\u5b66\u5148\u9a8c\u77e5\u8bc6\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u4f9d\u8d56\u968f\u673a\u542f\u53d1\u5f0f\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u4e3a\u5355\u7ec6\u80de\u8f6c\u5f55\u7ec4\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u66f4\u6709\u6548\u7684\u6570\u636e\u4e2d\u5fc3\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u73b0\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u7ed3\u6784\u53d1\u73b0\u548c\u8de8\u7269\u79cd\u5bf9\u9f50\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u964d\u4f4e\u8ba1\u7b97\u6210\u672c\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Conformal inference provides distribution-free guarantees, but existing approaches are either overly conservative, discarding many true-claims, or rely on adaptive error rates and simple linear models that fail to capture complex group structures. To address these challenges, we reformulate conformal inference in a multiplicative filtering setting, modeling factuality as a product of claim-level scores. Our method, Multi-LLM Adaptive Conformal Inference (MACI), leverages ensembles to produce more accurate factuality-scores, which in our experiments led to higher retention, while validity is preserved through group-conditional calibration.

Most test-time scaling (TTS) algorithms rely on autoregressive decoding, which is ill-suited to discrete diffusion language models (dLLMs) due to their parallel decoding over the entire sequence. As a result, developing effective and efficient TTS methods to unlock dLLMs' full generative potential remains an underexplored challenge. To address this, we propose Prism (Pruning, Remasking, and Integrated Self-verification Method), an efficient TTS framework for dLLMs that (i) performs Hierarchical Trajectory Search (HTS) which dynamically prunes and reallocates compute in an early-to-mid denoising window, (ii) introduces Local branching with partial remasking to explore diverse implementations while preserving high-confidence tokens, and (iii) replaces external verifiers with Self-Verified Feedback (SVF) obtained via self-evaluation prompts on intermediate completions. Across four mathematical reasoning and code generation benchmarks on three dLLMs, including LLaDA 8B Instruct, Dream 7B Instruct, and LLaDA 2.0-mini, our Prism achieves a favorable performance-efficiency trade-off, matching best-of-N performance with substantially fewer function evaluations (NFE).

However, three key challenges remain: (1) existing unlearning objectives often compromise model utility or increase vulnerability to Membership Inference Attacks (MIA); (2) there is a persistent conflict between forgetting and utility, where further unlearning inevitably harms retained performance; and (3) support for concurrent multi-client unlearning is poor, as gradient conflicts among clients degrade the quality of forgetting. To address these issues, we propose FUPareto, an efficient unlearning framework via Pareto-augmented optimization. We first introduce the Minimum Boundary Shift (MBS) Loss, which enforces unlearning by suppressing the target class logit below the highest non-target class logit; this can improve the unlearning efficiency and mitigate MIA risks. During the unlearning process, FUPareto performs Pareto improvement steps to preserve model utility and executes Pareto expansion to guarantee forgetting. Specifically, during Pareto expansion, the framework integrates a Null-Space Projected Multiple Gradient Descent Algorithm (MGDA) to decouple gradient conflicts. This enables effective, fair, and concurrent unlearning for multiple clients while minimizing utility degradation. Extensive experiments across diverse scenarios demonstrate that FUPareto consistently outperforms state-of-the-art FU methods in both unlearning efficacy and retained utility.", "AI": {"tldr": "FUPareto\uff1a\u57fa\u4e8e\u5e15\u7d2f\u6258\u4f18\u5316\u7684\u8054\u90a6\u9057\u5fd8\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6700\u5c0f\u8fb9\u754c\u504f\u79fb\u635f\u5931\u548c\u7a7a\u7a7a\u95f4\u6295\u5f71\u591a\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u7b97\u6cd5\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u8054\u90a6\u9057\u5fd8\u4e2d\u7684\u6548\u7528-\u9057\u5fd8\u51b2\u7a81\u548c\u591a\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u5e76\u53d1\u9057\u5fd8\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u8054\u90a6\u9057\u5fd8\u65b9\u6cd5\u5b58\u5728\u4e09\u4e2a\u5173\u952e\u95ee\u9898\uff1a1\uff09\u9057\u5fd8\u76ee\u6807\u5e38\u635f\u5bb3\u6a21\u578b\u6548\u7528\u6216\u589e\u52a0\u6210\u5458\u63a8\u7406\u653b\u51fb\u98ce\u9669\uff1b2\uff09\u9057\u5fd8\u4e0e\u6548\u7528\u4e4b\u95f4\u5b58\u5728\u56fa\u6709\u51b2\u7a81\uff1b3\uff09\u591a\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u5e76\u53d1\u9057\u5fd8\u652f\u6301\u5dee\uff0c\u68af\u5ea6\u51b2\u7a81\u4f1a\u964d\u4f4e\u9057\u5fd8\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faFUPareto\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1\uff09\u5f15\u5165\u6700\u5c0f\u8fb9\u754c\u504f\u79fb\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6291\u5236\u76ee\u6807\u7c7b\u522blogit\u4f4e\u4e8e\u6700\u9ad8\u975e\u76ee\u6807\u7c7b\u522blogit\u6765\u63d0\u9ad8\u9057\u5fd8\u6548\u7387\u5e76\u964d\u4f4eMIA\u98ce\u9669\uff1b2\uff09\u91c7\u7528\u5e15\u7d2f\u6258\u6539\u8fdb\u6b65\u9aa4\u4fdd\u6301\u6a21\u578b\u6548\u7528\uff1b3\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u5e15\u7d2f\u6258\u6269\u5c55\u4fdd\u8bc1\u9057\u5fd8\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u7a7a\u7a7a\u95f4\u6295\u5f71\u591a\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u7b97\u6cd5\u89e3\u8026\u68af\u5ea6\u51b2\u7a81\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u7684\u5e7f\u6cdb\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0cFUPareto\u5728\u9057\u5fd8\u6548\u679c\u548c\u4fdd\u7559\u6548\u7528\u65b9\u9762\u5747\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u6700\u5148\u8fdb\u7684\u8054\u90a6\u9057\u5fd8\u65b9\u6cd5\u3002", "conclusion": "FUPareto\u901a\u8fc7\u5e15\u7d2f\u6258\u589e\u5f3a\u4f18\u5316\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u8054\u90a6\u9057\u5fd8\u4e2d\u7684\u5173\u952e\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u9ad8\u6548\u3001\u516c\u5e73\u7684\u591a\u5ba2\u6237\u7aef\u5e76\u53d1\u9057\u5fd8\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u6548\u7528\u635f\u5931\u3002"}}

This paper presents a novel, data-efficient deep learning framework designed to achieve precise and accurate control using minimal sensor hardware. Leveraging an external dataset of 8 subjects, our approach implements a hybrid Transformer optimized for sparse, two-channel surface electromyography (sEMG). Unlike standard architectures that use fixed positional encodings, we integrate Time2Vec learnable temporal embeddings to capture the stochastic temporal warping inherent in biological signals. Furthermore, we employ a normalized additive fusion strategy that aligns the latent distributions of spatial and temporal features, preventing the destructive interference common in standard implementations. A two-stage curriculum learning protocol is utilized to ensure robust feature extraction despite data scarcity. The proposed architecture achieves a state-of-the-art multi-subject F1-score of 95.7% $\\pm$ 0.20% for a 10-class movement set, statistically outperforming both a standard Transformer with fixed encodings and a recurrent CNN-LSTM model. Architectural optimization reveals that a balanced allocation of model capacity between spatial and temporal dimensions yields the highest stability. Furthermore, while direct transfer to a new unseen subject led to poor accuracy due to domain shifts, a rapid calibration protocol utilizing only two trials per gesture recovered performance from 21.0% $\\pm$ 2.98% to 96.9% $\\pm$ 0.52%.

We propose addressing this gap by leveraging VLMs to guide the prioritization of experiences in the replay buffer.

Across scenarios, including game-playing and robotics, spanning both discrete and continuous domains, agents trained with our proposed prioritization method achieve 11-52% higher average success rates and improve sample efficiency by 19-45% compared to previous approaches. https://esharony.me/projects/vlm-rb/", "AI": {"tldr": "\u4f7f\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff08VLM\uff09\u4f5c\u4e3a\u81ea\u52a8\u8bc4\u4f30\u5668\uff0c\u6307\u5bfc\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u56de\u653e\u7f13\u51b2\u533a\u4e2d\u7ecf\u9a8c\u7684\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\u6392\u5e8f\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u5fae\u8c03\u5373\u53ef\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6210\u529f\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u5c3d\u7ba1\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u548c\u89c6\u89c9\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u5df2\u88ab\u6574\u5408\u5230\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u5404\u4e2a\u7ec4\u4ef6\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f46\u56de\u653e\u7f13\u51b2\u533a\u8fd9\u4e00\u5b58\u50a8\u548c\u91cd\u7528\u7ecf\u9a8c\u7684\u6838\u5fc3\u7ec4\u4ef6\u5c1a\u672a\u88ab\u63a2\u7d22\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u5229\u7528VLM\u6307\u5bfc\u56de\u653e\u7f13\u51b2\u533a\u4e2d\u7ecf\u9a8c\u7684\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\u6392\u5e8f\u3002", "method": "\u4f7f\u7528\u51bb\u7ed3\u7684\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3VLM\u4f5c\u4e3a\u81ea\u52a8\u8bc4\u4f30\u5668\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u548c\u4f18\u5148\u5904\u7406\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u7ecf\u9a8c\u4e2d\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u5b50\u8f68\u8ff9\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u65e0\u9700\u5bf9VLM\u8fdb\u884c\u5fae\u8c03\uff0c\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u6e38\u620f\u548c\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7b49\u79bb\u6563\u548c\u8fde\u7eed\u9886\u57df\u573a\u666f\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6e38\u620f\u548c\u673a\u5668\u4eba\u7b49\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u8be5\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\u6392\u5e8f\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u667a\u80fd\u4f53\u76f8\u6bd4\u5148\u524d\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5e73\u5747\u6210\u529f\u7387\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e8611-52%\uff0c\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\u63d0\u5347\u4e8619-45%\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5229\u7528\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3VLM\u6307\u5bfc\u56de\u653e\u7f13\u51b2\u533a\u4f18\u5148\u7ea7\u6392\u5e8f\u662f\u6709\u6548\u7684\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6837\u672c\u6548\u7387\u548c\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3aVLM\u5728\u5f3a\u5316\u5b66\u4e60\u4e2d\u7684\u5e94\u7528\u5f00\u8f9f\u4e86\u65b0\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

Recent works show that a large language model (LLM) can guide compiler search by reasoning over program structure and optimization history. However, using a single large model throughout the search is expensive, while smaller models are less reliable when used alone. Thus, this paper seeks to answer whether multi-LLM collaborative reasoning relying primarily on small LLMs can match or exceed the performance of a single large model. As such, we propose a lightweight collaborative multi-LLM framework, dubbed COLT, for compiler optimization that enables coordinated reasoning across multiple models within a single Monte Carlo tree search (MCTS) process. A key contribution is the use of a single shared MCTS tree as the collaboration substrate across LLMs, enabling the reuse of transformation prefixes and cross-model value propagation. Hence, we circumvent both heavy internal reasoning mechanisms and conventional agentic machinery that relies on external planners, multiple concurrent LLMs, databases, external memory/versioning of intermediate results, and controllers by simply endogenizing model selection within the lightweight MCTS optimization loop. Every iteration, the acting LLM proposes a joint action: (compiler transformation, model to be queried next). We also introduce a model-aware tree policy that biases search toward smaller models while preserving exploration, and a course-alteration mechanism that escalates to the largest model when the search exhibits persistent regressions attributable to smaller models.", "AI": {"tldr": "COLT\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u591aLLM\u534f\u4f5c\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5171\u4eabMCTS\u6811\u5b9e\u73b0\u7f16\u8bd1\u5668\u4f18\u5316\uff0c\u8ba9\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u534f\u4f5c\u8fbe\u5230\u6216\u8d85\u8d8a\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u964d\u4f4e\u63a8\u7406\u6210\u672c\u3002", "motivation": "\u6a21\u578b\u670d\u52a1\u6210\u672c\u4e3b\u5bfcAI\u7cfb\u7edf\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u7f16\u8bd1\u5668\u4f18\u5316\u3002\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u6307\u5bfc\u7f16\u8bd1\u5668\u641c\u7d22\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\uff0c\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\u5355\u72ec\u4f7f\u7528\u53ef\u9760\u6027\u4e0d\u8db3\u3002\u9700\u8981\u63a2\u7d22\u591aLLM\u534f\u4f5c\u80fd\u5426\u4ee5\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u8fbe\u5230\u6216\u8d85\u8d8a\u5355\u4e00\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faCOLT\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u5355\u4e2aMCTS\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u534f\u8c03\u591a\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u3002\u4f7f\u7528\u5171\u4eabMCTS\u6811\u4f5c\u4e3a\u534f\u4f5c\u57fa\u7840\uff0c\u91cd\u7528\u53d8\u6362\u524d\u7f00\u548c\u8de8\u6a21\u578b\u4ef7\u503c\u4f20\u64ad\u3002\u6bcf\u8f6e\u8fed\u4ee3\u4e2d\uff0c\u6267\u884cLLM\u63d0\u51fa\u8054\u5408\u52a8\u4f5c\uff08\u7f16\u8bd1\u5668\u53d8\u6362\uff0c\u4e0b\u4e00\u4e2a\u67e5\u8be2\u7684\u6a21\u578b\uff09\u3002\u5f15\u5165\u6a21\u578b\u611f\u77e5\u6811\u7b56\u7565\u504f\u5411\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u641c\u7d22\u6301\u7eed\u9000\u5316\u65f6\u5347\u7ea7\u5230\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u8bba\u6587\u58f0\u79f0COLT\u80fd\u591f\u5b9e\u73b0\u591aLLM\u534f\u4f5c\u63a8\u7406\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u901a\u8fc7\u5171\u4eabMCTS\u6811\u548c\u667a\u80fd\u6a21\u578b\u9009\u62e9\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u8fbe\u5230\u6216\u8d85\u8d8a\u5355\u4e00\u5927\u6a21\u578b\u7684\u7f16\u8bd1\u5668\u4f18\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "conclusion": "\u591aLLM\u534f\u4f5c\u6846\u67b6COLT\u901a\u8fc7\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7MCTS\u5b9e\u73b0\u6a21\u578b\u95f4\u534f\u8c03\uff0c\u907f\u514d\u4e86\u590d\u6742\u7684\u5916\u90e8\u89c4\u5212\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5728\u4fdd\u6301\u63a2\u7d22\u6027\u7684\u540c\u65f6\u6709\u6548\u5229\u7528\u5c0f\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u9700\u8981\u65f6\u5347\u7ea7\u5230\u5927\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u6210\u672c\u6548\u76ca\u7684\u7f16\u8bd1\u5668\u4f18\u5316\u3002"}}

The complex spatio-temporal dependencies and nonlinear dynamics of urban mobility networks further complicate few-shot learning across different cities. This paper proposes MCPST, a novel Multi-phase Consensus Spatio-Temporal framework for few-shot traffic forecasting that reconceptualises traffic prediction as a multi-phase consensus learning problem. Our framework introduces three core innovations: (1) a multi-phase engine that models traffic dynamics through diffusion, synchronisation, and spectral embeddings for comprehensive dynamic characterisation; (2) an adaptive consensus mechanism that dynamically fuses phase-specific predictions while enforcing consistency; and (3) a structured meta-learning strategy for rapid adaptation to new cities with minimal data. We establish extensive theoretical guarantees, including representation theorems with bounded approximation errors and generalisation bounds for few-shot adaptation. Through experiments on four real-world datasets, MCPST outperforms fourteen state-of-the-art methods in spatio-temporal graph learning methods, dynamic graph transfer learning methods, prompt-based spatio-temporal prediction methods and cross-domain few-shot settings, improving prediction accuracy while reducing required training data and providing interpretable insights.

Unlike data in vision and language domains, time series data is inherently tied to the evolution of underlying processes and can only accumulate as real-world time progresses, limiting the effectiveness of scale-driven pretraining alone. This time-bound constraint poses a challenge for enabling large language models (LLMs) to acquire forecasting capability, as existing approaches primarily rely on representation-level alignment or inference-time temporal modules rather than explicitly teaching forecasting behavior to the LLM. We propose T-LLM, a temporal distillation framework that equips general-purpose LLMs with time series forecasting capability by transferring predictive behavior from a lightweight temporal teacher during training. The teacher combines trend modeling and frequency-domain analysis to provide structured temporal supervision, and is removed entirely at inference, leaving the LLM as the sole forecasting model. Experiments on benchmark datasets and infectious disease forecasting tasks demonstrate that T-LLM consistently outperforms existing LLM-based forecasting methods under full-shot, few-shot, and zero-shot settings, while enabling a simple and efficient deployment pipeline.", "AI": {"tldr": "T-LLM\uff1a\u901a\u8fc7\u65f6\u95f4\u84b8\u998f\u6846\u67b6\u5c06\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\u8d4b\u4e88\u901a\u7528\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u989d\u5916\u6a21\u5757", "motivation": "\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u6570\u636e\u4e0e\u5e95\u5c42\u8fc7\u7a0b\u6f14\u5316\u76f8\u5173\uff0c\u53ea\u80fd\u968f\u65f6\u95f4\u7d2f\u79ef\uff0c\u9650\u5236\u4e86\u4ec5\u9760\u89c4\u6a21\u9a71\u52a8\u7684\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u6548\u679c\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u65b9\u6cd5\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u8868\u793a\u7ea7\u5bf9\u9f50\u6216\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u65f6\u95f4\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u672a\u80fd\u660e\u786e\u6559\u4f1aLLM\u9884\u6d4b\u884c\u4e3a\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faT-LLM\u65f6\u95f4\u84b8\u998f\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u671f\u95f4\u4ece\u8f7b\u91cf\u7ea7\u65f6\u95f4\u6559\u5e08\u6a21\u578b\u8f6c\u79fb\u9884\u6d4b\u884c\u4e3a\u5230\u901a\u7528LLM\u3002\u6559\u5e08\u6a21\u578b\u7ed3\u5408\u8d8b\u52bf\u5efa\u6a21\u548c\u9891\u57df\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u7ed3\u6784\u5316\u65f6\u95f4\u76d1\u7763\uff0c\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u5b8c\u5168\u79fb\u9664\uff0c\u4ec5\u4fdd\u7559LLM\u4f5c\u4e3a\u9884\u6d4b\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u57fa\u51c6\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u548c\u4f20\u67d3\u75c5\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e2d\uff0cT-LLM\u5728\u5168\u6837\u672c\u3001\u5c11\u6837\u672c\u548c\u96f6\u6837\u672c\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u59cb\u7ec8\u4f18\u4e8e\u73b0\u6709\u57fa\u4e8eLLM\u7684\u9884\u6d4b\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u7b80\u5355\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u90e8\u7f72\u6d41\u7a0b\u3002", "conclusion": "T-LLM\u6846\u67b6\u6210\u529f\u5c06\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\u80fd\u529b\u8d4b\u4e88\u901a\u7528LLM\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u65f6\u95f4\u84b8\u998f\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86\u65f6\u95f4\u7ea6\u675f\u5e26\u6765\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5728\u591a\u79cd\u8bbe\u7f6e\u4e0b\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u4f18\u8d8a\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

Structured pruning offers acceleration benefits but leads to significant performance degradation. Recent PCA-based pruning methods have alleviated this issue by retaining key activation components, but are only applied between modules in order to fuse the transformation matrix, which introduces extra parameters and severely disrupts activation distributions due to residual connections. To address these issues, we propose IntraSlice, a framework that applies block-wise module-intra PCA compression pruning. By leveraging the structural characteristics of Transformer modules, we design an approximate PCA method whose transformation matrices can be fully fused into the model without additional parameters. We also introduce a PCA-based global pruning ratio estimator that further considers the distribution of compressed activations, building on conventional module importance. We validate our method on Llama2, Llama3, and Phi series across various language benchmarks.

Recent methods leverage sparse expert routing to promote task specialization, but we find that the expert routing process suffers from drift as the data distribution evolves. For example, a grounding query that previously activated localization experts may instead be routed to irrelevant experts after learning OCR tasks. Meanwhile, the grounding-related experts can be overwritten by new tasks and lose their original functionality. Such failure reflects two problems: router drift, where expert selection becomes inconsistent over time, and expert drift, where shared experts are overwritten across tasks. Therefore, we propose StAbilized Mixture-of-Experts (SAME) for MCIT. To address router drift, SAME stabilizes expert selection by decomposing routing dynamics into orthogonal subspaces and updating only task-relevant directions.

However, existing pruning techniques often suffer severe degradation on generative reasoning tasks. Through a systematic study across multiple model families, we find that tasks requiring multi-step reasoning are particularly sensitive to depth reduction. Beyond surface-level text degeneration, we observe degradation of critical algorithmic capabilities, including arithmetic computation for mathematical reasoning and balanced parenthesis generation for code synthesis. Under realistic post-training constraints, without access to pretraining-scale data or compute, we evaluate a simple mitigation strategy based on supervised finetuning with Self-Generated Responses. This approach achieves strong recovery on classification tasks, retaining up to 90\\% of baseline performance, and yields substantial gains of up to 20--30 percentage points on generative benchmarks compared to prior post-pruning techniques. Crucially, despite these gains, recovery for generative reasoning remains fundamentally limited relative to classification tasks and is viable primarily at lower pruning ratios. Overall, we characterize the practical limits of layer pruning for generative reasoning and provide guidance on when depth reduction can be applied effectively under constrained post-training regimes.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u5c42\u526a\u679d\u5728\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u4e25\u91cd\u9000\u5316\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u591a\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u3002\u901a\u8fc7\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u7ed3\u5408\u81ea\u751f\u6210\u54cd\u5e94\u53ef\u4ee5\u90e8\u5206\u6062\u590d\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f46\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u6062\u590d\u4ecd\u6709\u9650\u5236\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709\u5c42\u526a\u679d\u6280\u672f\u5728\u538b\u7f29\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u65f6\uff0c\u5728\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u8868\u73b0\u826f\u597d\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u5b58\u5728\u4e25\u91cd\u6027\u80fd\u9000\u5316\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u63a2\u7d22\u5c42\u526a\u679d\u5bf9\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u53ca\u5176\u6062\u590d\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "method": "\u901a\u8fc7\u8de8\u591a\u4e2a\u6a21\u578b\u5bb6\u65cf\u7684\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u6df1\u5ea6\u51cf\u5c11\u5bf9\u591a\u6b65\u63a8\u7406\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\u3002\u5728\u6709\u9650\u7684\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u7ea6\u675f\u4e0b\uff0c\u8bc4\u4f30\u57fa\u4e8e\u76d1\u7763\u5fae\u8c03\u4e0e\u81ea\u751f\u6210\u54cd\u5e94\u7684\u7b80\u5355\u7f13\u89e3\u7b56\u7565\u3002", "result": "\u5206\u7c7b\u4efb\u52a1\u53ef\u4fdd\u7559\u9ad8\u8fbe90%\u7684\u57fa\u7ebf\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u76f8\u6bd4\u5148\u524d\u6280\u672f\u63d0\u534720-30\u4e2a\u767e\u5206\u70b9\u3002\u4f46\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u63a8\u7406\u7684\u6062\u590d\u4ecd\u6709\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u4e3b\u8981\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u8f83\u4f4e\u526a\u679d\u6bd4\u4f8b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u5c42\u526a\u679d\u5bf9\u751f\u6210\u5f0f\u63a8\u7406\u5b58\u5728\u5b9e\u9645\u9650\u5236\uff0c\u6df1\u5ea6\u51cf\u5c11\u4e3b\u8981\u5728\u8f83\u4f4e\u526a\u679d\u6bd4\u4f8b\u4e0b\u6709\u6548\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u7ea6\u675f\u540e\u8bad\u7ec3\u673a\u5236\u4e0b\u7684\u6df1\u5ea6\u51cf\u5c11\u5e94\u7528\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6307\u5bfc\u3002"}}

Prior methods devote the full rank budget to error reconstruction, which is suboptimal when $\\mathbf{W}$ has intrinsic low-rank structure and quantization corrupts dominant directions. We propose Structured Residual Reconstruction (SRR), a rank-allocation framework that preserves the top-$k$ singular subspace of the activation-scaled weight before quantization, quantizes only the residual, and uses the remaining rank $r-k$ for error reconstruction. We derive a theory-guided criterion for selecting $k$ by balancing quantization-exposed energy and unrecoverable error under rank constraints. We further show that resulting $\\mathbf{Q} + \\mathbf{L}\\mathbf{R}$ parameterization naturally supports Quantized Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (QPEFT), and stabilizes fine-tuning via gradient scaling along preserved directions.

Yet, the limited dynamic range of FP4 increases sensitivity to outliers. While NVFP4 mitigates quantization error via hierarchical microscaling, a persistent loss gap remains compared to BF16. This study conducts a longitudinal analysis of outlier dynamics across architecture during NVFP4 pretraining, focusing on where they localize, why they occur, and how they evolve temporally. We find that, compared with Softmax Attention (SA), Linear Attention (LA) reduces per-tensor heavy tails but still exhibits persistent block-level spikes under block quantization. Our analysis attributes outliers to specific architectural components: Softmax in SA, gating in LA, and SwiGLU in FFN, with \"post-QK\" operations exhibiting higher sensitivity to quantization. Notably, outliers evolve from transient spikes early in training to a small set of persistent hot channels (i.e., channels with persistently large magnitudes) in later stages. Based on these findings, we introduce Hot-Channel Patch (HCP), an online compensation mechanism that identifies hot channels and reinjects residuals using hardware-efficient kernels. We then develop CHON, an NVFP4 training recipe integrating HCP with post-QK operation protection. On GLA-1.3B model trained for 60B tokens, CHON reduces the loss gap to BF16 from 0.94% to 0.58% while maintaining downstream accuracy.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u5206\u6790\u4e86NVFP4\u91cf\u5316\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\u503c\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0Softmax Attention\u3001Linear Attention\u548cFFN\u4e2d\u7684\u7279\u5b9a\u7ec4\u4ef6\u4f1a\u4ea7\u751f\u5f02\u5e38\u503c\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5f02\u5e38\u503c\u4ece\u8bad\u7ec3\u65e9\u671f\u7684\u77ac\u65f6\u5c16\u5cf0\u6f14\u53d8\u4e3a\u540e\u671f\u7684\u6301\u4e45\u70ed\u901a\u9053\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u6b64\uff0c\u4f5c\u8005\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86Hot-Channel Patch\u5728\u7ebf\u8865\u507f\u673a\u5236\u548cCHON\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u7f29\u5c0f\u4e86NVFP4\u4e0eBF16\u7684\u635f\u5931\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f7f\u75284\u4f4d\u7b97\u672f\u8bad\u7ec3\u5927\u578b\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u53ef\u4ee5\u63d0\u9ad8\u541e\u5410\u91cf\u548c\u5185\u5b58\u6548\u7387\uff0c\u4f46FP4\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u8303\u56f4\u6709\u9650\u589e\u52a0\u4e86\u5bf9\u5f02\u5e38\u503c\u7684\u654f\u611f\u6027\u3002\u867d\u7136NVFP4\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u5c42\u5fae\u7f29\u653e\u51cf\u8f7b\u4e86\u91cf\u5316\u8bef\u5dee\uff0c\u4f46\u4e0eBF16\u76f8\u6bd4\u4ecd\u5b58\u5728\u6301\u7eed\u7684\u635f\u5931\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u65e8\u5728\u6df1\u5165\u5206\u6790NVFP4\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u5f02\u5e38\u503c\u7684\u52a8\u6001\u7279\u6027\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u5176\u5b9a\u4f4d\u3001\u6210\u56e0\u548c\u6f14\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\u3002", "method": "1. \u5bf9NVFP4\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e2d\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\u503c\u52a8\u6001\u8fdb\u884c\u7eb5\u5411\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u91cd\u70b9\u5173\u6ce8\u5176\u5728\u67b6\u6784\u4e2d\u7684\u5b9a\u4f4d\u3001\u6210\u56e0\u548c\u65f6\u5e8f\u6f14\u5316\uff1b2. \u8bc6\u522b\u4ea7\u751f\u5f02\u5e38\u503c\u7684\u7279\u5b9a\u67b6\u6784\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff1b3. \u63d0\u51faHot-Channel Patch\u5728\u7ebf\u8865\u507f\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u8bc6\u522b\u70ed\u901a\u9053\u5e76\u4f7f\u7528\u786c\u4ef6\u9ad8\u6548\u6838\u91cd\u65b0\u6ce8\u5165\u6b8b\u5dee\uff1b4. \u5f00\u53d1CHON\u8bad\u7ec3\u65b9\u6848\uff0c\u5c06HCP\u4e0epost-QK\u64cd\u4f5c\u4fdd\u62a4\u76f8\u7ed3\u5408\u3002", "result": "\u7814\u7a76\u53d1\u73b0\uff1a1. \u4e0eSoftmax Attention\u76f8\u6bd4\uff0cLinear Attention\u51cf\u5c11\u4e86\u6bcf\u5f20\u91cf\u7684\u91cd\u5c3e\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u5757\u91cf\u5316\u4e0b\u4ecd\u8868\u73b0\u51fa\u6301\u7eed\u7684\u5757\u7ea7\u5c16\u5cf0\uff1b2. \u5f02\u5e38\u503c\u4e3b\u8981\u6765\u81ea\u7279\u5b9a\u67b6\u6784\u7ec4\u4ef6\uff1aSA\u4e2d\u7684Softmax\u3001LA\u4e2d\u7684\u95e8\u63a7\u673a\u5236\u548cFFN\u4e2d\u7684SwiGLU\uff0c\u5176\u4e2d\"post-QK\"\u64cd\u4f5c\u5bf9\u91cf\u5316\u66f4\u654f\u611f\uff1b3. \u5f02\u5e38\u503c\u4ece\u8bad\u7ec3\u65e9\u671f\u7684\u77ac\u65f6\u5c16\u5cf0\u6f14\u53d8\u4e3a\u540e\u671f\u5c11\u91cf\u6301\u4e45\u7684\"\u70ed\u901a\u9053\"\uff1b4. \u5728GLA-1.3B\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec360B tokens\uff0cCHON\u5c06NVFP4\u4e0eBF16\u7684\u635f\u5931\u5dee\u8ddd\u4ece0.94%\u964d\u4f4e\u52300.58%\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u4e0b\u6e38\u4efb\u52a1\u51c6\u786e\u6027\u3002", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u6df1\u5165\u5206\u6790NVFP4\u91cf\u5316\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e2d\u7684\u5f02\u5e38\u503c\u52a8\u6001\uff0c\u672c\u7814\u7a76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u5f02\u5e38\u503c\u7684\u6765\u6e90\u548c\u6f14\u5316\u6a21\u5f0f\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u7684\u5728\u7ebf\u8865\u507f\u673a\u5236CHON\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u663e\u8457\u7f29\u5c0f\u4e864\u4f4d\u91cf\u5316\u4e0eBF16\u6d6e\u70b9\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6027\u80fd\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u4e3a\u9ad8\u6548\u7684\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u5b9e\u7528\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

However, interacting with real environments online can be risky and costly, motivating offline federated RL (FRL), where local devices learn from fixed datasets. Despite its promise, offline FRL may break down under low-quality, heterogeneous data. Offline RL tends to get stuck in local optima, and in FRL, one device's suboptimal policy can degrade the aggregated model, i.e., policy pollution. We present FORLER, combining Q-ensemble aggregation on the server with actor rectification on devices. The server robustly merges device Q-functions to curb policy pollution and shift heavy computation off resource-constrained hardware without compromising privacy. Locally, actor rectification enriches policy gradients via a zeroth-order search for high-Q actions plus a bespoke regularizer that nudges the policy toward them. A $\u03b4$-periodic strategy further reduces local computation. We theoretically provide safe policy improvement performance guarantees.

Existing studies of shortcut and spurious behavior largely rely on post hoc analyses or feature removal, offering limited insight into whether reliance can be modulated without altering task semantics. We introduce FiLoRA (Focus-and-Ignore LoRA), an instruction-conditioned, parameter-efficient adaptation framework that enables explicit control over internal feature reliance while keeping the predictive objective fixed. FiLoRA decomposes adaptation into feature group-aligned LoRA modules and applies instruction-conditioned gating, allowing natural language instructions to act as computation-level control signals rather than task redefinitions. Across text--image and audio--visual benchmarks, we show that instruction-conditioned gating induces consistent and causal shifts in internal computation, selectively amplifying or suppressing core and spurious feature groups without modifying the label space or training objective. Further analyses demonstrate that FiLoRA yields improved robustness under spurious feature interventions, revealing a principled mechanism to regulate reliance beyond correlation-driven learning.", "AI": {"tldr": "FiLoRA\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u6307\u4ee4\u6761\u4ef6\u5316\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u9002\u5e94\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u89e3\u7279\u5f81\u7ec4\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684LoRA\u6a21\u5757\u548c\u5e94\u7528\u6307\u4ee4\u6761\u4ef6\u95e8\u63a7\uff0c\u5b9e\u73b0\u5bf9\u5185\u90e8\u7279\u5f81\u4f9d\u8d56\u7684\u663e\u5f0f\u63a7\u5236\uff0c\u800c\u4e0d\u6539\u53d8\u9884\u6d4b\u76ee\u6807\u6216\u4efb\u52a1\u8bed\u4e49\u3002", "motivation": "\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u6574\u5408\u4e86\u8de8\u6a21\u6001\u7684\u5f02\u6784\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u4f46\u4eba\u4eec\u5bf9\u5176\u9884\u6d4b\u5982\u4f55\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u7279\u5b9a\u5185\u90e8\u7279\u5f81\u7ec4\u4ee5\u53ca\u8fd9\u79cd\u4f9d\u8d56\u662f\u5426\u53ef\u4ee5\u88ab\u6709\u610f\u63a7\u5236\u7684\u7406\u89e3\u4ecd\u7136\u6709\u9650\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u5173\u4e8e\u6377\u5f84\u548c\u865a\u5047\u884c\u4e3a\u7684\u7814\u7a76\u4e3b\u8981\u4f9d\u8d56\u4e8e\u4e8b\u540e\u5206\u6790\u6216\u7279\u5f81\u79fb\u9664\uff0c\u5bf9\u4e8e\u662f\u5426\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u4e0d\u6539\u53d8\u4efb\u52a1\u8bed\u4e49\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u8c03\u8282\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u9650\u7684\u89c1\u89e3\u3002", "method": "FiLoRA\uff08Focus-and-Ignore LoRA\uff09\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u6307\u4ee4\u6761\u4ef6\u5316\u7684\u53c2\u6570\u9ad8\u6548\u9002\u5e94\u6846\u67b6\u3002\u5b83\u5c06\u9002\u5e94\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u7279\u5f81\u7ec4\u5bf9\u9f50\u7684LoRA\u6a21\u5757\uff0c\u5e76\u5e94\u7528\u6307\u4ee4\u6761\u4ef6\u95e8\u63a7\uff0c\u4f7f\u81ea\u7136\u8bed\u8a00\u6307\u4ee4\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8ba1\u7b97\u7ea7\u63a7\u5236\u4fe1\u53f7\u800c\u975e\u4efb\u52a1\u91cd\u65b0\u5b9a\u4e49\u3002\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u5141\u8bb8\u5728\u4e0d\u4fee\u6539\u6807\u7b7e\u7a7a\u95f4\u6216\u8bad\u7ec3\u76ee\u6807\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\uff0c\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u5730\u653e\u5927\u6216\u6291\u5236\u6838\u5fc3\u548c\u865a\u5047\u7279\u5f81\u7ec4\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u6587\u672c-\u56fe\u50cf\u548c\u97f3\u9891-\u89c6\u89c9\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\uff0c\u6307\u4ee4\u6761\u4ef6\u95e8\u63a7\u5728\u5185\u90e8\u8ba1\u7b97\u4e2d\u8bf1\u5bfc\u4e86\u4e00\u81f4\u4e14\u56e0\u679c\u7684\u8f6c\u53d8\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u9009\u62e9\u6027\u5730\u653e\u5927\u6216\u6291\u5236\u6838\u5fc3\u548c\u865a\u5047\u7279\u5f81\u7ec4\u3002\u8fdb\u4e00\u6b65\u5206\u6790\u8868\u660e\uff0cFiLoRA\u5728\u865a\u5047\u7279\u5f81\u5e72\u9884\u4e0b\u63d0\u9ad8\u4e86\u9c81\u68d2\u6027\uff0c\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u8d85\u8d8a\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u9a71\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u8c03\u8282\u673a\u5236\u3002", "conclusion": "FiLoRA\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u539f\u5219\u6027\u673a\u5236\u6765\u8c03\u8282\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u57fa\u7840\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u5185\u90e8\u7279\u5f81\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\uff0c\u8d85\u8d8a\u4e86\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u9a71\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u4e3a\u5728\u4e0d\u6539\u53d8\u4efb\u52a1\u8bed\u4e49\u7684\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u63a7\u5236\u6a21\u578b\u5bf9\u7279\u5b9a\u7279\u5f81\u7ec4\u7684\u4f9d\u8d56\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u6846\u67b6\u3002"}}

In this setting, designing efficient no-swap regret translates to sublinear -- in horizon $T$ -- swap regret with polylogarithmic dependence on $N$. In contrast to the weaker notion of external regret minimization - a problem which is fairly well understood in the literature - achieving no-swap regret with a polylogarithmic dependence on $N$ has remained elusive in combinatorial bandits. Our paper resolves this challenge, by introducing a no-swap-regret learning algorithm with regret that scales polylogarithmically in $N$ and is tight for the class of combinatorial bandits.

To deepen the understanding between LLM's internal states and its verbalized reasoning trajectories, we investigate the latent planning strength of LLMs, through our probing method, Tele-Lens, applying to hidden states across diverse task domains. Our empirical results indicate that LLMs exhibit a myopic horizon, primarily conducting incremental transitions without precise global planning. Leveraging this characteristic, we propose a hypothesis on enhancing uncertainty estimation of CoT, which we validate that a small subset of CoT positions can effectively represent the uncertainty of the entire path. We further underscore the significance of exploiting CoT dynamics, and demonstrate that automatic recognition of CoT bypass can be achieved without performance degradation.

While physics-based simulations offer a scalable alternative to manual labelling, models trained on such data historically fail to generalise due to a significant domain gap, lacking the complex textures, noise patterns, and imaging artefacts inherent to experimental data. This paper introduces a novel framework for labour-free segmentation that successfully bridges this simulation-to-reality gap. Our pipeline leverages phase-field simulations to generate an abundant source of microstructural morphologies with perfect, intrinsically-derived ground-truth masks. We then employ a Cycle-Consistent Generative Adversarial Network (CycleGAN) for unpaired image-to-image translation, transforming the clean simulations into a large-scale dataset of high-fidelity, realistic SEM images. A U-Net model, trained exclusively on this synthetic data, demonstrated remarkable generalisation when deployed on unseen experimental images, achieving a mean Boundary F1-Score of 0.90 and an Intersection over Union (IOU) of 0.88. Comprehensive validation using t-SNE feature-space projection and Shannon entropy analysis confirms that our synthetic images are statistically and featurally indistinguishable from the real data manifold. By completely decoupling model training from manual annotation, our generative framework transforms a data-scarce problem into one of data abundance, providing a robust and fully automated solution to accelerate materials discovery and analysis.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u65e0\u9700\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\u7684\u663e\u5fae\u56fe\u50cf\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5272\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u76f8\u573a\u6a21\u62df\u751f\u6210\u5fae\u7ed3\u6784\u5f62\u6001\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528CycleGAN\u5c06\u6a21\u62df\u56fe\u50cf\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u903c\u771f\u7684SEM\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3U-Net\u6a21\u578b\u5728\u5b9e\u9a8c\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0a\u5b9e\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\u6cdb\u5316\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u663e\u5fae\u56fe\u50cf\u8bed\u4e49\u5206\u5272\u5bf9\u9ad8\u901a\u91cf\u6750\u6599\u8868\u5f81\u81f3\u5173\u91cd\u8981\uff0c\u4f46\u4e13\u5bb6\u6807\u6ce8\u6570\u636e\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u3001\u4e3b\u89c2\u6027\u5f3a\u4e14\u7a00\u7f3a\u3002\u57fa\u4e8e\u7269\u7406\u7684\u6a21\u62df\u867d\u7136\u53ef\u6269\u5c55\uff0c\u4f46\u7531\u4e8e\u57df\u5dee\u8ddd\uff08\u7f3a\u4e4f\u590d\u6742\u7eb9\u7406\u3001\u566a\u58f0\u6a21\u5f0f\u548c\u6210\u50cf\u4f2a\u5f71\uff09\uff0c\u8bad\u7ec3\u6a21\u578b\u96be\u4ee5\u6cdb\u5316\u5230\u5b9e\u9a8c\u6570\u636e\u3002", "method": "1. \u4f7f\u7528\u76f8\u573a\u6a21\u62df\u751f\u6210\u5927\u91cf\u5fae\u7ed3\u6784\u5f62\u6001\uff0c\u83b7\u5f97\u5b8c\u7f8e\u3001\u5185\u5728\u884d\u751f\u7684\u771f\u5b9e\u63a9\u7801\uff1b2. \u91c7\u7528CycleGAN\u8fdb\u884c\u975e\u914d\u5bf9\u56fe\u50cf\u5230\u56fe\u50cf\u8f6c\u6362\uff0c\u5c06\u5e72\u51c0\u7684\u6a21\u62df\u56fe\u50cf\u8f6c\u6362\u4e3a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u3001\u9ad8\u4fdd\u771f\u7684\u771f\u5b9eSEM\u56fe\u50cf\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff1b3. \u4ec5\u4f7f\u7528\u5408\u6210\u6570\u636e\u8bad\u7ec3U-Net\u6a21\u578b\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u672a\u89c1\u8fc7\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0a\uff0cU-Net\u6a21\u578b\u5b9e\u73b0\u4e86\u5e73\u5747\u8fb9\u754cF1\u5206\u65700.90\u548c\u4ea4\u5e76\u6bd40.88\u3002\u901a\u8fc7t-SNE\u7279\u5f81\u7a7a\u95f4\u6295\u5f71\u548c\u9999\u519c\u71b5\u5206\u6790\u9a8c\u8bc1\uff0c\u5408\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u5728\u7edf\u8ba1\u548c\u7279\u5f81\u4e0a\u4e0e\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u6d41\u5f62\u65e0\u6cd5\u533a\u5206\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u751f\u6210\u6846\u67b6\u5b8c\u5168\u89e3\u8026\u4e86\u6a21\u578b\u8bad\u7ec3\u4e0e\u4eba\u5de5\u6807\u6ce8\uff0c\u5c06\u6570\u636e\u7a00\u7f3a\u95ee\u9898\u8f6c\u5316\u4e3a\u6570\u636e\u4e30\u5bcc\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u52a0\u901f\u6750\u6599\u53d1\u73b0\u548c\u5206\u6790\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7a33\u5065\u3001\u5b8c\u5168\u81ea\u52a8\u5316\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848\u3002"}}

While maximizing VNE under constraints is well known in quantum settings, a principled analogue of the classical maximum entropy framework, particularly its decision theoretic and game theoretic interpretation, has not been explicitly developed for VNE in data driven contexts. In this paper, we extend the minimax formulation of the maximum entropy principle due to Gr\u00fcnwald and Dawid to the setting of von Neumann entropy, providing a game-theoretic justification for VNE maximization over density matrices and trace-normalized positive semidefinite operators. This perspective yields a robust interpretation of maximum VNE solutions under partial information and clarifies their role as least committed inferences in spectral domains. We then illustrate how the resulting Maximum VNE principle applies to modern machine learning problems by considering two representative applications, selecting a kernel representation from multiple normalized embeddings via kernel-based VNE maximization, and completing kernel matrices from partially observed entries.

Among existing methods, GPTQ has been widely adopted due to its efficiency; however, it neglects input statistics and inter-group correlations when determining group scales, leading to a mismatch with its goal of minimizing layer-wise reconstruction loss. In this work, we propose a two-stage optimization framework for group scales that explicitly minimizes the layer-wise reconstruction loss. In the first stage, performed prior to GPTQ, we initialize each group scale to minimize the group-wise reconstruction loss, thereby incorporating input statistics. In the second stage, we freeze the integer weights obtained via GPTQ and refine the group scales to minimize the layer-wise reconstruction loss. To this end, we employ the coordinate descent algorithm and derive a closed-form update rule, which enables efficient refinement without costly numerical optimization. Notably, our derivation incorporates the quantization errors from preceding layers to prevent error accumulation. Experimental results demonstrate that our method consistently enhances group-wise quantization, achieving higher accuracy with negligible overhead.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e00\u79cd\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u5c42\u95f4\u91cd\u6784\u635f\u5931\u6765\u6539\u8fdbGPTQ\u5206\u7ec4\u91cf\u5316\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4f4e\u6bd4\u7279\u91cf\u5316\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709GPTQ\u65b9\u6cd5\u867d\u7136\u9ad8\u6548\uff0c\u4f46\u5728\u786e\u5b9a\u5206\u7ec4\u5c3a\u5ea6\u65f6\u5ffd\u7565\u4e86\u8f93\u5165\u7edf\u8ba1\u7279\u6027\u548c\u7ec4\u95f4\u76f8\u5173\u6027\uff0c\u4e0e\u5176\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u5c42\u95f4\u91cd\u6784\u635f\u5931\u7684\u76ee\u6807\u4e0d\u5339\u914d\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u7cbe\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\uff1a\u7b2c\u4e00\u9636\u6bb5\u5728GPTQ\u4e4b\u524d\u521d\u59cb\u5316\u5206\u7ec4\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4ee5\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u7ec4\u5185\u91cd\u6784\u635f\u5931\uff1b\u7b2c\u4e8c\u9636\u6bb5\u51bb\u7ed3GPTQ\u5f97\u5230\u7684\u6574\u6570\u6743\u91cd\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u5750\u6807\u4e0b\u964d\u7b97\u6cd5\u548c\u95ed\u5f0f\u66f4\u65b0\u89c4\u5219\u4f18\u5316\u5206\u7ec4\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4ee5\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u5c42\u95f4\u91cd\u6784\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u5e76\u8003\u8651\u524d\u5c42\u91cf\u5316\u8bef\u5dee\u9632\u6b62\u8bef\u5dee\u7d2f\u79ef", "result": "\u5b9e\u9a8c\u7ed3\u679c\u8868\u660e\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u80fd\u6301\u7eed\u63d0\u5347\u5206\u7ec4\u91cf\u5316\u6548\u679c\uff0c\u4ee5\u53ef\u5ffd\u7565\u7684\u5f00\u9500\u5b9e\u73b0\u66f4\u9ad8\u7684\u7cbe\u5ea6", "conclusion": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u9636\u6bb5\u4f18\u5316\u6846\u67b6\u663e\u5f0f\u6700\u5c0f\u5316\u5c42\u95f4\u91cd\u6784\u635f\u5931\uff0c\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86GPTQ\u5ffd\u7565\u8f93\u5165\u7edf\u8ba1\u548c\u7ec4\u95f4\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u7684\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u4e3a\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u4f4e\u6bd4\u7279\u91cf\u5316\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u66f4\u7cbe\u786e\u7684\u89e3\u51b3\u65b9\u6848"}}

Recent generative models have shown promise in accelerating simulations, yet they struggle with long-horizon generation due to architectural constraints, error accumulation, and inadequate modeling of spatio-temporal dynamics. We present STAR-MD (Spatio-Temporal Autoregressive Rollout for Molecular Dynamics), a scalable SE(3)-equivariant diffusion model that generates physically plausible protein trajectories over microsecond timescales. Our key innovation is a causal diffusion transformer with joint spatio-temporal attention that efficiently captures complex space-time dependencies while avoiding the memory bottlenecks of existing methods. On the standard ATLAS benchmark, STAR-MD achieves state-of-the-art performance across all metrics--substantially improving conformational coverage, structural validity, and dynamic fidelity compared to previous methods. STAR-MD successfully extrapolates to generate stable microsecond-scale trajectories where baseline methods fail catastrophically, maintaining high structural quality throughout the extended rollout.

A prominent approach is to fine-tune an existing model with an unlearning loss that retains overall utility. The space of suitable unlearning loss functions is vast, making the search for an optimal loss function daunting. Additionally, there might not even exist a universally optimal loss function: differences in the structure and overlap of the forget and retain data can cause a loss to work well in one setting but over-unlearn or under-unlearn in another. Our approach EvoMU tackles these two challenges simultaneously. An evolutionary search procedure automatically finds task-specific losses in the vast space of possible unlearning loss functions. This allows us to find dataset-specific losses that match or outperform existing losses from the literature, without the need for a human-in-the-loop. This work is therefore an instance of automatic scientific discovery, a.k.a. an AI co-scientist. In contrast to previous AI co-scientist works, we do so on a budget: We achieve SotA results using a small 4B parameter model (Qwen3-4B-Thinking), showing the potential of AI co-scientists with limited computational resources. Our experimental evaluation shows that we surpass previous loss-based unlearning formulations on TOFU-5%, TOFU-10%, MUSE and WMDP by synthesizing novel unlearning losses.

Generative selection methods, such as GenSelect, address this bottleneck, yet strong selection performance remains largely limited to large models. We show that small reasoning models can acquire strong GenSelect capabilities through targeted reinforcement learning. To this end, we synthesize selection tasks from large-scale math and code instruction datasets by filtering to instances with both correct and incorrect candidate solutions, and train 1.7B-parameter models with DAPO to reward correct selections. Across math (AIME24, AIME25, HMMT25) and code (LiveCodeBench) reasoning benchmarks, our models consistently outperform prompting and majority-voting baselines, often approaching or exceeding much larger models. Moreover, these gains generalize to selecting outputs from stronger models despite training only on outputs from weaker models.

To reduce overhead and improve exploration, prior work introduces tree structured rollouts, which share reasoning prefixes and branch at key nodes to improve sampling efficiency. However, this paradigm still faces two challenges: (1) high entropy branching can trigger rollout collapse, where the branching budget concentrates on a few trajectories with consecutive high-entropy segments, rapidly reducing the number of effective branches; (2) early pseudo-labels are noisy and biased, which can induce self-reinforcing overfitting, causing the policy to sharpen prematurely and suppress exploration. To address these issues, we propose Entropy Confidence Hybrid Group Relative Policy Optimization (ECHO). During rollout, ECHO jointly leverages local entropy and group level confidence to adaptively control branch width, and further introduces online confidence-based pruning to terminate persistently low confidence branches, avoiding high entropy traps and mitigating collapse. During policy updates, ECHO employs confidence adaptive clipping and an entropy confidence hybrid advantage shaping approach to enhance training robustness and mitigate early stage bias.

Yet, dense and element-wise rounding matrices are prohibitively expensive for billion-parameter large language models (LLMs). We revisit adaptive rounding from an efficiency perspective and propose VQRound, a parameter-efficient optimization framework that reparameterizes the rounding matrix into a compact codebook. Unlike low-rank alternatives, VQRound minimizes the element-wise worst-case error under $L_\\infty$ norm, which is critical for handling heavy-tailed weight distributions in LLMs. Beyond reparameterization, we identify rounding initialization as a decisive factor and develop a lightweight end-to-end finetuning pipeline that optimizes codebooks across all layers using only 128 samples. Extensive experiments on OPT, LLaMA, LLaMA2, and Qwen3 models demonstrate that VQRound achieves better convergence than traditional adaptive rounding at the same number of steps while using as little as 0.2% of the trainable parameters. Our results show that adaptive rounding can be made both scalable and fast-fitting.

In this work, we propose a framework for counterfactual validation of TLP models by generating causal temporal interaction graphs (CTIGs) with known ground-truth causal structure. We first introduce a structural equation model for continuous-time event sequences that supports both excitatory and inhibitory effects, and then extend this mechanism to temporal interaction graphs. To compare causal models, we propose a distance metric based on cross-model predictive error, and empirically validate the hypothesis that predictors trained on one causal model degrade when evaluated on sufficiently distant models. Finally, we instantiate counterfactual evaluation under (i) controlled causal shifts between generating models and (ii) timestamp shuffling as a stochastic distortion with measurable causal distance.

However, existing methods require known physical properties as supervision or inputs, limiting their applicability under unknown conditions. To explore this challenge, we introduce Cloth Dynamics Grounding (CDG), a novel scenario for unsupervised learning of cloth dynamics from multi-view visual observations. We further propose Cloth Dynamics Splatting (CloDS), an unsupervised dynamic learning framework designed for CDG. CloDS adopts a three-stage pipeline that first performs video-to-geometry grounding and then trains a dynamics model on the grounded meshes. To cope with large non-linear deformations and severe self-occlusions during grounding, we introduce a dual-position opacity modulation that supports bidirectional mapping between 2D observations and 3D geometry via mesh-based Gaussian splatting in video-to-geometry grounding stage. It jointly considers the absolute and relative position of Gaussian components. Comprehensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that CloDS effectively learns cloth dynamics from visual data while maintaining strong generalization capabilities for unseen configurations.

While classical survival models such as Cox remain widely adopted in standard practice, they rely on restrictive assumptions, including linear covariate relationships and proportional hazards over time, that often fail to capture real-world clinical dynamics. Recent deep learning approaches like DeepSurv and DeepHit offer improved expressivity but sacrifice interpretability, limiting clinical adoption where trust and transparency are paramount. Hybrid models incorporating Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs), such as CoxKAN, have begun to address this trade-off but remain constrained by the semi-parametric Cox framework. In this work we introduce SurvKAN, a fully parametric, time-continuous survival model based on KAN architectures that eliminates the proportional hazards constraint. SurvKAN treats time as an explicit input to a KAN that directly predicts the log-hazard function, enabling end-to-end training on the full survival likelihood.

We present ECHO-2, a distributed RL framework for post-training with remote inference workers and non-negligible dissemination latency. ECHO-2 combines centralized learning with distributed rollouts and treats bounded policy staleness as a user-controlled parameter, enabling rollout generation, dissemination, and training to overlap. We introduce an overlap-based capacity model that relates training time, dissemination latency, and rollout throughput, yielding a practical provisioning rule for sustaining learner utilization. To mitigate dissemination bottlenecks and lower cost, ECHO-2 employs peer-assisted pipelined broadcast and cost-aware activation of heterogeneous workers.

However, the internal dynamics of this compressed state remain largely opaque. In this work, we present a comprehensive study on the runtime state dynamics of state-of-the-art Linear Attention models. We uncover a fundamental phenomenon termed State Rank Stratification, characterized by a distinct spectral bifurcation among linear attention heads: while one group maintains an effective rank oscillating near zero, the other exhibits rapid growth that converges to an upper bound. Extensive experiments across diverse inference contexts reveal that these dynamics remain strikingly consistent, indicating that the identity of a head,whether low-rank or high-rank,is an intrinsic structural property acquired during pre-training, rather than a transient state dependent on the input data. Furthermore, our diagnostic probes reveal a surprising functional divergence: low-rank heads are indispensable for model reasoning, whereas high-rank heads exhibit significant redundancy.

Existing KV cache eviction strategies fail to address the heterogeneous attention distributions between visual and text tokens, leading to suboptimal efficiency or degraded performance. In this paper, we propose Hierarchical Adaptive Eviction (HAE), a KV cache eviction framework that optimizes text-visual token interaction in MLLMs by implementing Dual-Attention Pruning during pre-filling (leveraging visual token sparsity and attention variance) and a Dynamic Decoding Eviction Strategy (inspired by OS Recycle Bins) during decoding. HAE minimizes KV cache usage across layers, reduces computational overhead via index broadcasting, and theoretically ensures superior information integrity and lower error bounds compared to greedy strategies, enhancing efficiency in both comprehension and generation tasks. Empirically, HAE reduces KV-Cache memory by 41\\% with minimal accuracy loss (0.3\\% drop) in image understanding tasks and accelerates story generation inference by 1.5x while maintaining output quality on Phi3.5-Vision-Instruct model.", "AI": {"tldr": "HAE\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u9488\u5bf9\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u5927\u8bed\u8a00\u6a21\u578b\u7684KV\u7f13\u5b58\u9010\u51fa\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u5c42\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u7b56\u7565\u4f18\u5316\u89c6\u89c9\u4e0e\u6587\u672ctoken\u7684\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u51cf\u5c11\u5185\u5b58\u4f7f\u7528\u5e76\u63d0\u5347\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u73b0\u6709KV\u7f13\u5b58\u9010\u51fa\u7b56\u7565\u672a\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5904\u7406\u89c6\u89c9\u4e0e\u6587\u672ctoken\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5f02\u6784\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u5206\u5e03\uff0c\u5bfc\u81f4\u6548\u7387\u4f4e\u4e0b\u6216\u6027\u80fd\u4e0b\u964d\uff0c\u9700\u8981\u4e13\u95e8\u9488\u5bf9MLLMs\u7684\u4f18\u5316\u65b9\u6848\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u5206\u5c42\u81ea\u9002\u5e94\u9010\u51fa\u6846\u67b6\uff1a1)\u9884\u586b\u5145\u9636\u6bb5\u91c7\u7528\u53cc\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u526a\u679d\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u89c6\u89c9token\u7a00\u758f\u6027\u548c\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u65b9\u5dee\uff1b2)\u89e3\u7801\u9636\u6bb5\u91c7\u7528\u52a8\u6001\u9010\u51fa\u7b56\u7565\uff0c\u53d7\u64cd\u4f5c\u7cfb\u7edf\u56de\u6536\u7ad9\u542f\u53d1\uff1b3)\u901a\u8fc7\u7d22\u5f15\u5e7f\u64ad\u51cf\u5c11\u8ba1\u7b97\u5f00\u9500\u3002", "result": "\u5728Phi3.5-Vision-Instruct\u6a21\u578b\u4e0a\uff0cKV\u7f13\u5b58\u5185\u5b58\u51cf\u5c1141%\uff0c\u56fe\u50cf\u7406\u89e3\u4efb\u52a1\u51c6\u786e\u7387\u4ec5\u4e0b\u964d0.3%\uff1b\u6545\u4e8b\u751f\u6210\u63a8\u7406\u901f\u5ea6\u63d0\u53471.5\u500d\uff0c\u540c\u65f6\u4fdd\u6301\u8f93\u51fa\u8d28\u91cf\u3002", "conclusion": "HAE\u6709\u6548\u89e3\u51b3\u4e86MLLMs\u4e2d\u89c6\u89c9\u4e0e\u6587\u672ctoken\u4ea4\u4e92\u7684\u5f02\u6784\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u95ee\u9898\uff0c\u5728\u7406\u8bba\u4e0a\u6709\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u5b8c\u6574\u6027\u548c\u66f4\u4f4e\u7684\u8bef\u5dee\u8fb9\u754c\uff0c\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e86\u591a\u6a21\u6001\u4efb\u52a1\u7684\u6548\u7387\u3002"}}

Chemical space is vast, often estimated at approximately 10^60 drug-like molecules, while only thousands of drugs have been approved. As a result, self-supervised pretraining on large unlabeled molecular corpora has become essential for data-efficient molecular representation learning. We introduce **CardinalGraphFormer**, a graph transformer that incorporates Graphormer-inspired structural biases, including shortest-path distance and centrality, as well as direct-bond edge bias, within a structured sparse attention regime limited to shortest-path distance <= 3. The model further augments this design with a cardinality-preserving unnormalized aggregation channel over the same support set. Pretraining combines contrastive graph-level alignment with masked attribute reconstruction.

This design yields a spatially grounded EEG spatial super-resolution framework with consistent performance improvements.

Adding entropy regularization during SFT is not a cure-all; it tends to flatten token distributions toward uniformity, increasing entropy without improving meaningful exploration capability. In this paper, we propose CurioSFT, an entropy-preserving SFT method designed to enhance exploration capabilities through intrinsic curiosity. It consists of (a) Self-Exploratory Distillation, which distills the model toward a self-generated, temperature-scaled teacher to encourage exploration within its capability; and (b) Entropy-Guided Temperature Selection, which adaptively adjusts distillation strength to mitigate knowledge forgetting by amplifying exploration at reasoning tokens while stabilizing factual tokens. Extensive experiments on mathematical reasoning tasks demonstrate that, in SFT stage, CurioSFT outperforms the vanilla SFT by 2.5 points on in-distribution tasks and 2.9 points on out-of-distribution tasks.

These models achieve long-term forecasting mainly by scaling up the model size rather than through genuinely autoregressive (AR) rollout. From the perspective of large language model training, the traditional training process for time-series forecasting models ignores temporal causality. In this paper, we propose a novel training method for time-series forecasting that enforces two key properties: (1) AR prediction errors should increase with the forecasting horizon. Any violation of this principle is considered random guessing and is explicitly penalized in the loss function, and (2) the method enables models to concatenate short-term AR predictions for forming flexible long-term forecasts. Empirical results demonstrate that our method establishes a new state-of-the-art across multiple benchmarks, achieving an MSE reduction of more than 10% compared to iTransformer and other recent strong baselines. Furthermore, it enables short-horizon forecasting models to perform reliable long-term predictions at horizons over 7.5 times longer.

ICL is strikingly sample-efficient, often learning from only a handful of demonstrations, but complex reasoning tasks typically demand many training examples to learn from. However, naively scaling ICL by adding more demonstrations breaks down at this scale: attention costs grow quadratically, performance saturates or degrades with longer contexts, and the approach remains a shallow form of learning. Due to these limitations, practitioners predominantly rely on in-weight learning (IWL) to induce reasoning. In this work, we show that by using Prefix Tuning, LLMs can learn to reason without overloading the context window and without any weight updates. We introduce $\\textbf{ReasonCACHE}$, an instantiation of this mechanism that distills demonstrations into a fixed key-value cache. Empirically, across challenging reasoning benchmarks, including GPQA-Diamond, ReasonCACHE outperforms standard ICL and matches or surpasses IWL approaches. Further, it achieves this all while being more efficient across three key axes: data, inference cost, and trainable parameters. We also theoretically prove that ReasonCACHE can be strictly more expressive than low-rank weight update since the latter ties expressivity to input rank, whereas ReasonCACHE bypasses this constraint by directly injecting key-values into the attention mechanism. Together, our findings identify ReasonCACHE as a middle path between in-context and in-weight learning, providing a scalable algorithm for learning reasoning skills beyond the context window without modifying parameters.

Latest approaches have streamlined the alignment process by deriving implicit reward functions, yet they often suffer from a critical objective mismatch: optimizing the relative margin between chosen and rejected responses does not guarantee the preservation of the chosen response's absolute likelihood. This can lead to ``unlearning'', where the model degrades the probability of high-quality outputs to satisfy margin constraints, and ``formatting collapse'' caused by the over-penalization of rejected sequences. In this work, we introduce SLIME (Stabilized Likelihood Implicit Margin Enforcement), a reference-free alignment objective designed to decouple preference learning from generation quality. SLIME incorporates a three-pronged objective: (1) an anchoring term to maximize the likelihood of preferred responses; (2) a stabilizing penalty that prevents the probabilities of rejected tokens from collapsing to zero; and (3) a dual-margin mechanism that combines hard and soft constraints for precise boundary shaping.

We formalize two representational hypotheses: (1) a representation in the product space of all factors, whose dimension grows exponentially with the number of parts, or (2) a factored representation in orthogonal subspaces, whose dimension grows linearly. The factored representation is lossless when factors are conditionally independent, but sacrifices predictive fidelity otherwise, creating a tradeoff between dimensional efficiency and accuracy. We derive precise predictions about the geometric structure of activations for each, including the number of subspaces, their dimensionality, and the arrangement of context embeddings within them. We test between these hypotheses on transformers trained on synthetic processes with known latent structure. Models learn factored representations when factors are conditionally independent, and continue to favor them early in training even when noise or hidden dependencies undermine conditional independence, reflecting an inductive bias toward factoring at the cost of fidelity. This provides a principled explanation for why transformers decompose the world into parts, and suggests that interpretable low dimensional structure may persist even in models trained on complex data.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u901a\u8fc7\u4e0b\u4e00\u4e2a\u8bcd\u9884\u6d4b\u9884\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684Transformer\u5c06\u4e16\u754c\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u90e8\u5206\uff0c\u5e76\u5728\u6b8b\u5dee\u6d41\u7684\u6b63\u4ea4\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u8868\u793a\u8fd9\u4e9b\u56e0\u5b50\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u6bd4\u8f83\u4e86\u4e24\u79cd\u8868\u793a\u5047\u8bbe\uff1a\u4e58\u79ef\u7a7a\u95f4\u8868\u793a\uff08\u7ef4\u5ea6\u6307\u6570\u589e\u957f\uff09\u4e0e\u56e0\u5b50\u5316\u8868\u793a\uff08\u7ef4\u5ea6\u7ebf\u6027\u589e\u957f\uff09\uff0c\u53d1\u73b0\u6a21\u578b\u503e\u5411\u4e8e\u56e0\u5b50\u5316\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u8fd9\u4f1a\u727a\u7272\u9884\u6d4b\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u3002", "motivation": "\u7814\u7a76Transformer\u6a21\u578b\u5982\u4f55\u8868\u793a\u4e16\u754c\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5b83\u4eec\u662f\u5426\u5c06\u590d\u6742\u4e16\u754c\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u72ec\u7acb\u56e0\u5b50\u5e76\u5728\u6b63\u4ea4\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u8868\u793a\u8fd9\u4e9b\u56e0\u5b50\u3002\u7406\u89e3\u6a21\u578b\u8868\u793a\u7ed3\u6784\u6709\u52a9\u4e8e\u89e3\u91ca\u4e3a\u4ec0\u4e48Transformer\u80fd\u591f\u6709\u6548\u5b66\u4e60\u590d\u6742\u6570\u636e\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e24\u79cd\u8868\u793a\u5047\u8bbe\u7684\u6570\u5b66\u5f62\u5f0f\u5316\uff1a\u4e58\u79ef\u7a7a\u95f4\u8868\u793a\u548c\u56e0\u5b50\u5316\u8868\u793a\u3002\u5728\u5df2\u77e5\u6f5c\u5728\u7ed3\u6784\u7684\u5408\u6210\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3Transformer\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u5206\u6790\u6fc0\u6d3b\u7684\u51e0\u4f55\u7ed3\u6784\uff08\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u6570\u91cf\u3001\u7ef4\u5ea6\u3001\u4e0a\u4e0b\u6587\u5d4c\u5165\u6392\u5217\uff09\u6765\u6d4b\u8bd5\u8fd9\u4e24\u79cd\u5047\u8bbe\u3002", "result": "\u5f53\u56e0\u5b50\u6761\u4ef6\u72ec\u7acb\u65f6\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u5b66\u4e60\u56e0\u5b50\u5316\u8868\u793a\uff1b\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u65e9\u671f\u5b58\u5728\u566a\u58f0\u6216\u9690\u85cf\u4f9d\u8d56\u5173\u7cfb\u7834\u574f\u6761\u4ef6\u72ec\u7acb\u6027\u65f6\uff0c\u6a21\u578b\u4ecd\u7136\u503e\u5411\u4e8e\u56e0\u5b50\u5316\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u53cd\u6620\u4e86\u4ee5\u4fdd\u771f\u5ea6\u4e3a\u4ee3\u4ef7\u8fdb\u884c\u56e0\u5b50\u5206\u89e3\u7684\u5f52\u7eb3\u504f\u7f6e\u3002", "conclusion": "Transformer\u503e\u5411\u4e8e\u5c06\u4e16\u754c\u5206\u89e3\u4e3a\u90e8\u5206\u5e76\u5728\u6b63\u4ea4\u5b50\u7a7a\u95f4\u4e2d\u8868\u793a\uff0c\u8fd9\u4e3a\u89e3\u91caTransformer\u5982\u4f55\u5206\u89e3\u4e16\u754c\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u539f\u5219\u6027\u89e3\u91ca\uff0c\u5e76\u8868\u660e\u5373\u4f7f\u5728\u590d\u6742\u6570\u636e\u4e0a\u8bad\u7ec3\u7684\u6a21\u578b\u4e2d\uff0c\u53ef\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u4f4e\u7ef4\u7ed3\u6784\u53ef\u80fd\u4ecd\u7136\u5b58\u5728\u3002"}}

By injecting controlled synthetic uniformly random noise into otherwise clean datasets, we analyze training dynamics across model sizes ranging from 480M to 5.2B parameters. We show that noisy data indeed induces training loss divergence, and that the probability of divergence depends strongly on the noise type, amount of noise, and model scale. We further find that noise-induced divergences exhibit activation patterns distinct from those caused by high learning rates, and we provide diagnostics that differentiate these two failure modes.

A promising alternative is to leverage high-quality expert human solutions, yet naive imitation of this data fails because it is fundamentally out of distribution: expert solutions are typically didactic, containing implicit reasoning gaps intended for human readers rather than computational models. Furthermore, high-quality expert solutions are expensive, necessitating generalizable sample-efficient training methods.

Rivera", "Obinna Nwokonkwo", "Steven A. Wilson", "Christopher L. Muhich"], "title": "Active Transfer Bagging: A New Approach for Accelerated Active Learning Acquisition of Data by Combined Transfer Learning and Bagging Based Models", "comment": null, "summary": "Modern machine learning has achieved remarkable success on many problems, but this success often depends on the existence of large, labeled datasets. While active learning can dramatically reduce labeling cost when annotations are expensive, early performance is frequently dominated by the initial seed set, typically chosen at random. In many applications, however, related or approximate datasets are readily available and can be leveraged to construct a better seed set. We introduce a new method for selecting the seed data set for active learning, Active-Transfer Bagging (ATBagging). ATBagging estimates the informativeness of candidate data point from a Bayesian interpretation of bagged ensemble models by comparing in-bag and out-of-bag predictive distributions from the labeled dataset, yielding an information-gain proxy. To avoid redundant selections, we impose feature-space diversity by sampling a determinantal point process (DPP) whose kernel uses Random Fourier Features and a quality-diversity factorization that incorporates the informativeness scores. This same blended method is used for selection of new data points to collect during the active learning phase. We evaluate ATBagging on four real-world datasets covering both target-transfer and feature-shift scenarios (QM9, ERA5, Forbes 2000, and Beijing PM2.5). Across seed sizes nseed = 10-100, ATBagging improves or ties early active learning and increases area under the learning-curve relative to alternative seed subset selection methodologies in almost all cases, with strongest benefits in low-data regimes. Thus, ATBagging provides a low-cost, high reward means to initiating active learning-based data collection.", "AI": {"tldr": "ATBagging\u662f\u4e00\u79cd\u65b0\u7684\u4e3b\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u79cd\u5b50\u96c6\u9009\u62e9\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u88c5\u888b\u96c6\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u4f30\u8ba1\u5019\u9009\u6570\u636e\u70b9\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u91cf\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u7279\u5f81\u7a7a\u95f4\u591a\u6837\u6027\u91c7\u6837\uff0c\u5728\u4f4e\u6570\u636e\u91cf\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e3b\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u65e9\u671f\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u4e3b\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u65e9\u671f\u6027\u80fd\u901a\u5e38\u53d7\u9650\u4e8e\u968f\u673a\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u521d\u59cb\u79cd\u5b50\u96c6\uff0c\u800c\u5b9e\u9645\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u5e38\u5b58\u5728\u76f8\u5173\u6216\u8fd1\u4f3c\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u53ef\u7528\u4e8e\u6784\u5efa\u66f4\u597d\u7684\u79cd\u5b50\u96c6\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u5229\u7528\u8fd9\u4e9b\u53ef\u7528\u6570\u636e\u6765\u6539\u8fdb\u4e3b\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u542f\u52a8\u9636\u6bb5\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faActive-Transfer Bagging (ATBagging)\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a1\uff09\u901a\u8fc7\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u89e3\u91ca\u7684\u88c5\u888b\u96c6\u6210\u6a21\u578b\uff0c\u6bd4\u8f83\u5e26\u6807\u7b7e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\u7684\u5185\u888b\u548c\u5916\u888b\u9884\u6d4b\u5206\u5e03\u6765\u4f30\u8ba1\u5019\u9009\u6570\u636e\u70b9\u7684\u4fe1\u606f\u91cf\uff1b2\uff09\u4e3a\u907f\u514d\u5197\u4f59\u9009\u62e9\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u968f\u673a\u5085\u91cc\u53f6\u7279\u5f81\u548c\u8d28-\u91cf\u591a\u6837\u6027\u5206\u89e3\u7684\u786e\u5b9a\u6027\u70b9\u8fc7\u7a0b\u5728\u7279\u5f81\u7a7a\u95f4\u65bd\u52a0\u591a\u6837\u6027\u7ea6\u675f\uff1b3\uff09\u5c06\u540c\u4e00\u6df7\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u7528\u4e8e\u4e3b\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u9636\u6bb5\u7684\u65b0\u6570\u636e\u70b9\u9009\u62e9\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u56db\u4e2a\u771f\u5b9e\u6570\u636e\u96c6\uff08QM9\u3001ERA5\u3001Forbes 2000\u548c\u5317\u4eacPM2.5\uff09\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0c\u6db5\u76d6\u76ee\u6807\u8fc1\u79fb\u548c\u7279\u5f81\u504f\u79fb\u573a\u666f\u3002\u5728\u79cd\u5b50\u5927\u5c0fnseed=10-100\u8303\u56f4\u5185\uff0cATBagging\u5728\u51e0\u4e4e\u6240\u6709\u60c5\u51b5\u4e0b\u90fd\u6539\u5584\u6216\u6301\u5e73\u65e9\u671f\u4e3b\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u5e76\u63d0\u9ad8\u5b66\u4e60\u66f2\u7ebf\u4e0b\u9762\u79ef\uff0c\u5728\u4f4e\u6570\u636e\u91cf\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u6548\u679c\u6700\u663e\u8457\u3002", "conclusion": "ATBagging\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u79cd\u4f4e\u6210\u672c\u3001\u9ad8\u56de\u62a5\u7684\u65b9\u6cd5\u6765\u542f\u52a8\u57fa\u4e8e\u4e3b\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u6570\u636e\u6536\u96c6\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u662f\u5728\u4f4e\u6570\u636e\u91cf\u573a\u666f\u4e0b\u80fd\u663e\u8457\u63d0\u5347\u4e3b\u52a8\u5b66\u4e60\u7684\u65e9\u671f\u6027\u80fd\u3002"}}

We study a hybrid perspective: \\emph{trust region continual learning} that combines generative replay with a Fisher-metric trust region constraint. We show that, under local approximations, the resulting update admits a MAML-style interpretation with a single implicit inner step: replay supplies an old-task gradient signal (query-like), while the Fisher-weighted penalty provides an efficient offline curvature shaping (support-like). This yields an emergent meta-learning property in continual learning: the model becomes an initialization that rapidly \\emph{re-converges} to prior task optima after each task transition, without explicitly optimizing a bilevel objective.

However, numerous recent works have shown that it is unable to perform basic tasks involving detecting triples of correlated tokens, or compositional tasks where multiple input tokens need to be referenced to generate a result. Some higher-dimensional alternatives to self-attention have been proposed to address this, including higher-order attention and Strassen attention, which can perform some of these polyadic tasks in exchange for slower, superquadratic running times.\n  In this work, we define a vast class of generalizations of self-attention, which we call poly-attention mechanisms. Our mechanisms can incorporate arbitrary higher-order (tensor) computations as well as arbitrary relationship structures between the input tokens, and they include the aforementioned alternatives as special cases. We then systematically study their computational complexity and representational strength, including giving new algorithms and matching complexity-theoretic lower bounds on the time complexity of computing the attention matrix exactly as well as approximately, and tightly determining which polyadic tasks they can each perform. Our results give interesting trade-offs between different desiderata for these mechanisms, including a tight relationship between how expressive a mechanism is, and how large the coefficients in the model may be so that the mechanism can be approximated in almost-linear time.\n  Notably, we give a new attention mechanism which can be computed exactly in quadratic time, and which can perform function composition for any fixed number of functions. Prior mechanisms, even for just composing two functions, could only be computed in superquadratic time, and our new lower bounds show that faster algorithms for them are not possible.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u672c\u6587\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\"\u591a\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\"\u8fd9\u4e00\u5e7f\u4e49\u7684\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u5904\u7406\u4efb\u610f\u9ad8\u9636\u5f20\u91cf\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u8f93\u5165\u6807\u8bb0\u95f4\u7684\u590d\u6742\u5173\u7cfb\u7ed3\u6784\uff0c\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u5176\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u6027\u548c\u8868\u793a\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5e76\u7ed9\u51fa\u4e86\u65b0\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u548c\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u4e0b\u754c\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u7684\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u867d\u7136\u80fd\u6709\u6548\u5efa\u6a21\u6807\u8bb0\u95f4\u7684\u6210\u5bf9\u4ea4\u4e92\uff0c\u4f46\u65e0\u6cd5\u5904\u7406\u6d89\u53ca\u4e09\u4e2a\u6216\u66f4\u591a\u6807\u8bb0\u76f8\u5173\u6027\u7684\u57fa\u672c\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u4e5f\u65e0\u6cd5\u5b8c\u6210\u9700\u8981\u5f15\u7528\u591a\u4e2a\u8f93\u5165\u6807\u8bb0\u7684\u7ec4\u5408\u4efb\u52a1\u3002\u73b0\u6709\u7684\u4e00\u4e9b\u9ad8\u9636\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u66ff\u4ee3\u65b9\u6848\u867d\u7136\u80fd\u5904\u7406\u67d0\u4e9b\u591a\u5143\u4efb\u52a1\uff0c\u4f46\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u9ad8\uff08\u8d85\u4e8c\u6b21\u65f6\u95f4\uff09\u3002", "method": "\u5b9a\u4e49\u4e86\u5e7f\u4e49\u7684\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u7c7b\u522b\u2014\u2014\u591a\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u80fd\u591f\u7eb3\u5165\u4efb\u610f\u9ad8\u9636\uff08\u5f20\u91cf\uff09\u8ba1\u7b97\u548c\u8f93\u5165\u6807\u8bb0\u95f4\u7684\u4efb\u610f\u5173\u7cfb\u7ed3\u6784\u3002\u7cfb\u7edf\u7814\u7a76\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e9b\u673a\u5236\u7684\u8ba1\u7b97\u590d\u6742\u6027\u548c\u8868\u793a\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u7ed9\u51fa\u65b0\u7b97\u6cd5\u548c\u5339\u914d\u7684\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\u7406\u8bba\u4e0b\u754c\uff0c\u7cbe\u786e\u548c\u8fd1\u4f3c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u77e9\u9635\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u590d\u6742\u5ea6\uff0c\u5e76\u4e25\u683c\u786e\u5b9a\u4e86\u6bcf\u79cd\u673a\u5236\u80fd\u6267\u884c\u7684\u591a\u5143\u4efb\u52a1\u3002", "result": "\u63d0\u51fa\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u65b0\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u5728\u4e8c\u6b21\u65f6\u95f4\u5185\u7cbe\u786e\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u5e76\u4e14\u80fd\u591f\u6267\u884c\u4efb\u610f\u56fa\u5b9a\u6570\u91cf\u51fd\u6570\u7684\u51fd\u6570\u7ec4\u5408\u3002\u800c\u5148\u524d\u7684\u673a\u5236\u5373\u4f7f\u53ea\u7ec4\u5408\u4e24\u4e2a\u51fd\u6570\uff0c\u4e5f\u9700\u8981\u8d85\u4e8c\u6b21\u65f6\u95f4\u8ba1\u7b97\uff0c\u65b0\u7684\u4e0b\u754c\u8868\u660e\u66f4\u5feb\u7684\u7b97\u6cd5\u662f\u4e0d\u53ef\u80fd\u7684\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u63ed\u793a\u4e86\u8fd9\u4e9b\u673a\u5236\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u9700\u6c42\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u6709\u8da3\u6743\u8861\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u673a\u5236\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u4e0e\u6a21\u578b\u7cfb\u6570\u5927\u5c0f\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u7d27\u5bc6\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u4ee5\u4fbf\u673a\u5236\u80fd\u5728\u51e0\u4e4e\u7ebf\u6027\u65f6\u95f4\u5185\u8fd1\u4f3c\u3002", "conclusion": "\u591a\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u4e00\u4e2a\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u6846\u67b6\u6765\u6269\u5c55\u81ea\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u7684\u80fd\u529b\uff0c\u4f7f\u5176\u80fd\u591f\u5904\u7406\u66f4\u590d\u6742\u7684\u591a\u5143\u4ea4\u4e92\u548c\u7ec4\u5408\u4efb\u52a1\u3002\u7814\u7a76\u5728\u8868\u8fbe\u80fd\u529b\u548c\u8ba1\u7b97\u6548\u7387\u4e4b\u95f4\u5efa\u7acb\u4e86\u91cd\u8981\u7684\u6743\u8861\u5173\u7cfb\uff0c\u4e3a\u8bbe\u8ba1\u66f4\u5f3a\u5927\u7684\u6ce8\u610f\u529b\u673a\u5236\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u7406\u8bba\u57fa\u7840\u548c\u5b9e\u7528\u6307\u5bfc\u3002"}}

For responsible LLM application, Uncertainty Quantification (UQ) techniques are used to estimate a model's uncertainty about its outputs, indicating the likelihood that those outputs may be problematic. For LLM reasoning tasks, it is essential to estimate the uncertainty not only for the final answer, but also for the intermediate steps of the reasoning, as this can enable more fine-grained and targeted interventions. In this study, we explore what UQ metrics better reflect the LLM's ``intermediate uncertainty''during reasoning. Our study reveals that an LLMs' incorrect reasoning steps tend to contain tokens which are highly sensitive to the perturbations on the preceding token embeddings.

Fine-grained MoE, featuring hundreds of well-trained experts per layer and multi-expert activation per token, offers an unexplored alternative through its rich routing space. We empirically characterize fine-grained MoE routing and uncover an informative pattern: router scores exhibit a certain head of high-confidence experts followed by an uncertain tail of low-confidence candidates. While single-run greedy accuracy remains stable when fewer experts are activated, multi-sample pass@n degrades significantly-suggesting that the certain head governs core reasoning capability while the uncertain tail correlates with reasoning diversity. Motivated by these findings, we propose Expert-Sample, a training-free method that preserves high-confidence selections while injecting controlled stochasticity into the uncertain tail, enabling diverse generation without destabilizing outputs. Evaluated on multiple fine-grained MoE models across math, knowledge reasoning, and code tasks, Expert-Sample consistently improves pass@n and verification-based accuracy.

Srikant"], "title": "Finite-Sample Wasserstein Error Bounds and Concentration Inequalities for Nonlinear Stochastic Approximation", "comment": null, "summary": "This paper derives non-asymptotic error bounds for nonlinear stochastic approximation algorithms in the Wasserstein-$p$ distance. To obtain explicit finite-sample guarantees for the last iterate, we develop a coupling argument that compares the discrete-time process to a limiting Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. Our analysis applies to algorithms driven by general noise conditions, including martingale differences and functions of ergodic Markov chains. Complementing this result, we handle the convergence rate of the Polyak-Ruppert average through a direct analysis that applies under the same general setting.\n  Assuming the driving noise satisfies a non-asymptotic central limit theorem, we show that the normalized last iterates converge to a Gaussian distribution in the $p$-Wasserstein distance at a rate of order $\u03b3_n^{1/6}$, where $\u03b3_n$ is the step size. Similarly, the Polyak-Ruppert average is shown to converge in the Wasserstein distance at a rate of order $n^{-1/6}$. These distributional guarantees imply high-probability concentration inequalities that improve upon those derived from moment bounds and Markov's inequality. We demonstrate the utility of this approach by considering two applications: (1) linear stochastic approximation, where we explicitly quantify the transition from heavy-tailed to Gaussian behavior of the iterates, thereby bridging the gap between recent finite-sample analyses and asymptotic theory and (2) stochastic gradient descent, where we establish rate of convergence to the central limit theorem.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u4e3a\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u968f\u673a\u903c\u8fd1\u7b97\u6cd5\u5728Wasserstein-p\u8ddd\u79bb\u4e0b\u63a8\u5bfc\u4e86\u975e\u6e10\u8fd1\u8bef\u5dee\u754c\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8026\u5408\u65b9\u6cd5\u6bd4\u8f83\u79bb\u6563\u65f6\u95f4\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e0e\u6781\u9650Ornstein-Uhlenbeck\u8fc7\u7a0b\uff0c\u83b7\u5f97\u6700\u7ec8\u8fed\u4ee3\u7684\u663e\u5f0f\u6709\u9650\u6837\u672c\u4fdd\u8bc1\uff0c\u5e76\u5206\u6790\u4e86Polyak-Ruppert\u5e73\u5747\u7684\u6536\u655b\u901f\u7387\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edf\u968f\u673a\u903c\u8fd1\u7b97\u6cd5\u7684\u5206\u6790\u4e3b\u8981\u5173\u6ce8\u6e10\u8fd1\u6027\u8d28\u6216\u57fa\u4e8e\u77e9\u754c\u7684\u6982\u7387\u4e0d\u7b49\u5f0f\uff0c\u7f3a\u4e4f\u5bf9\u6700\u7ec8\u8fed\u4ee3\u7684\u6709\u9650\u6837\u672c\u5206\u5e03\u4fdd\u8bc1\u3002\u672c\u6587\u65e8\u5728\u586b\u8865\u8fd9\u4e00\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u4e3a\u975e\u7ebf\u6027\u548c\u7ebf\u6027\u968f\u673a\u903c\u8fd1\u7b97\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u975e\u6e10\u8fd1\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u6536\u655b\u901f\u7387\u5206\u6790\u3002", "method": "\u5f00\u53d1\u8026\u5408\u8bba\u8bc1\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u5c06\u79bb\u6563\u65f6\u95f4\u968f\u673a\u903c\u8fd1\u8fc7\u7a0b\u4e0e\u6781\u9650Ornstein-Uhlenbeck\u8fc7\u7a0b\u8fdb\u884c\u6bd4\u8f83\uff1b\u5728\u9a71\u52a8\u566a\u58f0\u6ee1\u8db3\u975e\u6e10\u8fd1\u4e2d\u5fc3\u6781\u9650\u5b9a\u7406\u7684\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\uff0c\u5206\u6790\u6700\u7ec8\u8fed\u4ee3\u548cPolyak-Ruppert\u5e73\u5747\u5728Wasserstein-p\u8ddd\u79bb\u4e0b\u7684\u6536\u655b\u901f\u7387\u3002", "result": "\u8bc1\u660e\u5f52\u4e00\u5316\u6700\u7ec8\u8fed\u4ee3\u4ee5\u03b3_n^{1/6}\u7684\u901f\u7387\u5728p-Wasserstein\u8ddd\u79bb\u4e0b\u6536\u655b\u5230\u9ad8\u65af\u5206\u5e03\uff08\u03b3_n\u4e3a\u6b65\u957f\uff09\uff1bPolyak-Ruppert\u5e73\u5747\u4ee5n^{-1/6}\u7684\u901f\u7387\u6536\u655b\uff1b\u8fd9\u4e9b\u5206\u5e03\u4fdd\u8bc1\u5bfc\u51fa\u4e86\u4f18\u4e8e\u77e9\u754c\u548c\u9a6c\u5c14\u53ef\u592b\u4e0d\u7b49\u5f0f\u7684\u9ad8\u6982\u7387\u6d53\u5ea6\u4e0d\u7b49\u5f0f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u8be5\u7814\u7a76\u4e3a\u968f\u673a\u903c\u8fd1\u7b97\u6cd5\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u975e\u6e10\u8fd1\u7684\u5206\u5e03\u6536\u655b\u7406\u8bba\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u586b\u8865\u4e86\u6709\u9650\u6837\u672c\u5206\u6790\u4e0e\u6e10\u8fd1\u7406\u8bba\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u7a7a\u767d\uff0c\u5728\u7ebf\u6027\u968f\u673a\u903c\u8fd1\u548c\u968f\u673a\u68af\u5ea6\u4e0b\u964d\u7b49\u5e94\u7528\u4e2d\u5c55\u793a\u4e86\u8be5\u65b9\u6cd5\u7684\u5b9e\u7528\u6027\u3002"}}

Traditional approaches such as random sampling, greedy information maximization, and round-robin coverage treat each decision in isolation, unable to learn adaptive strategies from experience. We propose Active Causal Experimentalist (ACE), which learns experimental design as a sequential policy. Our key insight is that while absolute information gains diminish as knowledge accumulates (making value-based RL unstable), relative comparisons between candidate interventions remain meaningful throughout. ACE exploits this via Direct Preference Optimization, learning from pairwise intervention comparisons rather than non-stationary reward magnitudes. Across synthetic benchmarks, physics simulations, and economic data, ACE achieves 70-71% improvement over baselines at equal intervention budgets (p < 0.001, Cohen's d ~ 2). Notably, the learned policy autonomously discovers that collider mechanisms require concentrated interventions on parent variables, a theoretically-grounded strategy that emerges purely from experience.

Despite these benefits, traditional single-server FL suffers from high communication latency due to the aggregation of models from a large number of clients. While multi-server FL distributes workloads across edge servers, overlapping client coverage and uncoordinated selection often lead to resource contention, causing bandwidth conflicts and training failures. To address these limitations, we propose a decentralized reinforcement learning with conflict risk prediction, named RL CRP, to optimize client selection in multi-server FL systems. Specifically, each server estimates the likelihood of client selection conflicts using a categorical hidden Markov model based on its sparse historical client selection sequence. Then, a fairness-aware reward mechanism is incorporated to promote long-term client participation for minimizing training latency and resource contention.

While prior work has extensively explored depth expansion, width expansion remains significantly understudied, with the few existing methods limited to the early stages of training. However, expanding width during the mid-stage is essential for maximizing computational savings, yet it remains a formidable challenge due to severe training instabilities. Empirically, we show that naive initialization at this stage disrupts activation statistics, triggering loss spikes, while copy-based initialization introduces gradient symmetry that hinders feature diversity. To address these issues, we propose SPARKLING (balancing {S}ignal {P}reservation {A}nd symmet{R}y brea{K}ing for width-progressive {L}earn{ING}), a novel framework for mid-stage width expansion.

At the other extreme, distillation offers dense supervision but requires demonstrations, which are costly and difficult to scale. We study text feedback as an intermediate signal: richer than scalar rewards, yet cheaper than complete demonstrations. Textual feedback is a natural mode of human interaction and is already abundant in many real-world settings, where users, annotators, and automated judges routinely critique LLM outputs. Towards leveraging text feedback at scale, we formalize a multi-turn RL setup, RL from Text Feedback (RLTF), where text feedback is available during training but not at inference. Therefore, models must learn to internalize the feedback in order to improve their test-time single-turn performance. To do this, we propose two methods: Self Distillation (RLTF-SD), which trains the single-turn policy to match its own feedback-conditioned second-turn generations; and Feedback Modeling (RLTF-FM), which predicts the feedback as an auxiliary objective. We provide theoretical analysis on both methods, and empirically evaluate on reasoning puzzles, competition math, and creative writing tasks. Our results show that both methods consistently outperform strong baselines across benchmarks, highlighting the potential of RL with an additional source of rich supervision at scale.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51faRLTF\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5229\u7528\u6587\u672c\u53cd\u9988\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4ecb\u4e8e\u7a00\u758f\u5956\u52b1\u548c\u5b8c\u6574\u6f14\u793a\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u4e2d\u95f4\u76d1\u7763\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u4e24\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\uff08\u81ea\u6211\u84b8\u998f\u548c\u53cd\u9988\u5efa\u6a21\uff09\u8ba9\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u5316\u53cd\u9988\u4ee5\u63d0\u5347\u5355\u8f6e\u63a8\u7406\u6027\u80fd\u3002", "motivation": "\u4f20\u7edfRL\u65b9\u6cd5\u4f9d\u8d56\u7a00\u758f\u7684\u4e8c\u8fdb\u5236\u5956\u52b1\u6216\u504f\u597d\u6807\u7b7e\uff0c\u4fe1\u606f\u91cf\u6709\u9650\uff1b\u800c\u84b8\u998f\u65b9\u6cd5\u9700\u8981\u5b8c\u6574\u7684\u6f14\u793a\uff0c\u6210\u672c\u9ad8\u4e14\u96be\u4ee5\u6269\u5c55\u3002\u6587\u672c\u53cd\u9988\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4e2d\u95f4\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u6bd4\u6807\u91cf\u5956\u52b1\u66f4\u4e30\u5bcc\uff0c\u53c8\u6bd4\u5b8c\u6574\u6f14\u793a\u66f4\u4fbf\u5b9c\uff0c\u662f\u81ea\u7136\u7684\u4eba\u7c7b\u4ea4\u4e92\u65b9\u5f0f\u4e14\u5728\u8bb8\u591a\u5b9e\u9645\u573a\u666f\u4e2d\u5df2\u5927\u91cf\u5b58\u5728\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faRLTF\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u5728\u8bad\u7ec3\u65f6\u4f7f\u7528\u6587\u672c\u53cd\u9988\u4f46\u63a8\u7406\u65f6\u4e0d\u4f7f\u7528\u3002\u5f00\u53d1\u4e24\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a1) RLTF-SD\uff1a\u8bad\u7ec3\u5355\u8f6e\u7b56\u7565\u4ee5\u5339\u914d\u5176\u81ea\u8eab\u53cd\u9988\u6761\u4ef6\u4e0b\u7684\u7b2c\u4e8c\u8f6e\u751f\u6210\uff1b2) RLTF-FM\uff1a\u5c06\u9884\u6d4b\u53cd\u9988\u4f5c\u4e3a\u8f85\u52a9\u76ee\u6807\u3002\u4e24\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u90fd\u65e8\u5728\u8ba9\u6a21\u578b\u5185\u5316\u53cd\u9988\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "result": "\u5728\u63a8\u7406\u8c1c\u9898\u3001\u7ade\u8d5b\u6570\u5b66\u548c\u521b\u610f\u5199\u4f5c\u4efb\u52a1\u4e0a\u7684\u5b9e\u9a8c\u8868\u660e\uff0c\u4e24\u79cd\u65b9\u6cd5\u5728\u591a\u4e2a\u57fa\u51c6\u6d4b\u8bd5\u4e2d\u5747\u6301\u7eed\u4f18\u4e8e\u5f3a\u57fa\u7ebf\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u8bc1\u660e\u4e86\u5229\u7528\u4e30\u5bcc\u6587\u672c\u53cd\u9988\u8fdb\u884cRL\u7684\u6f5c\u529b\u3002", "conclusion": "\u6587\u672c\u53cd\u9988\u4f5c\u4e3a\u4ecb\u4e8e\u7a00\u758f\u5956\u52b1\u548c\u5b8c\u6574\u6f14\u793a\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u4e2d\u95f4\u76d1\u7763\u4fe1\u53f7\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7RLTF\u6846\u67b6\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u63d0\u5347LLM\u7684\u5355\u8f6e\u63a8\u7406\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4e3a\u5927\u89c4\u6a21\u5229\u7528\u4e30\u5bcc\u76d1\u7763\u4fe1\u53f7\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u524d\u666f\u7684\u65b9\u5411\u3002"}}

This design is misaligned with generative recommendation objectives: semantic embeddings are weakly coupled with collaborative prediction, and generic quantization is inefficient at reducing sequential uncertainty for autoregressive modeling. To address these, we propose ReSID, a recommendation-native, principled SID framework that rethinks representation learning and quantization from the perspective of information preservation and sequential predictability, without relying on LLMs. ReSID consists of two components: (i) Field-Aware Masked Auto-Encoding (FAMAE), which learns predictive-sufficient item representations from structured features, and (ii) Globally Aligned Orthogonal Quantization (GAOQ), which produces compact and predictable SID sequences by jointly reducing semantic ambiguity and prefix-conditional uncertainty. Theoretical analysis and extensive experiments across ten datasets show the effectiveness of ReSID. ReSID consistently outperforms strong sequential and SID-based generative baselines by an average of over 10%, while reducing tokenization cost by up to 122x.

Moreover, our theory-motivated automatic environment adaptation improves training for both the reward and policy models by leveraging critic feedback from each, enabling learning from experience.

Fine-tuning on the task of word decoding from brain data, MEG-XL matches supervised performance with a fraction of the data (e.g. 1hr vs 50hrs) and outperforms brain foundation models. We find that models pre-trained with longer contexts learn representations that transfer better to word decoding.

While Deep Learning architectures (e.g., Two-Tower Networks) are the standard solution for de-biasing, we demonstrate that in High-Bias Regimes, state-of-the-art Deep Ensembles suffer from Shortcut Learning: they minimize training loss by overfitting to the rank signal, leading to degraded ranking quality despite high prediction accuracy. We propose Linear Position-bias Aware Learning (Linear-PAL), a lightweight framework that enforces de-biasing through structural constraints: explicit feature conjunctions and aggressive regularization. We further introduce a Vectorized Integer Hashing technique for feature generation, replacing string-based operations with $O(N)$ vectorized arithmetic. Evaluating on a large-scale dataset (4.2M samples), Linear-PAL achieves Pareto Dominance: it outperforms Deep Ensembles in de-biased ranking quality (Relevance AUC: 0.7626 vs. 0.6736) while reducing training latency by 43x (40s vs 1762s).

Existing mitigations via prompting or supervised fine-tuning fail to generalize, as they modify surface behavior without changing the optimization objective that makes bias cues predictive. To address this gap, we propose Epistemic Independence Training (EIT), a reinforcement learning framework grounded in a key principle: to learn independence, bias cues must be made non-predictive of reward. EIT operationalizes this through a balanced conflict strategy where bias signals are equally likely to support correct and incorrect answers, combined with a reward design that penalizes bias-following without rewarding bias agreement. Experiments on Qwen3-4B demonstrate that EIT improves both accuracy and robustness under adversarial biases, while preserving performance when bias aligns with truth. Notably, models trained only on bandwagon bias generalize to unseen bias types such as authority and distraction, indicating that EIT induces transferable epistemic independence rather than bias-specific heuristics.

This paper presents the Spatio-Temporal Transformer for Long Term Forecasting (STT-LTF ), an extended framework that advances beyond purely temporal analysis to integrate spatial context modeling with temporal sequence prediction. STT-LTF processes multi-scale spatial patches alongside temporal sequences (up to 20 years) through a unified transformer architecture, capturing both local neighborhood relationships and regional climate influences. The framework employs comprehensive self-supervised learning with spatial masking, temporal masking, and horizon sampling strategies, enabling robust model training from 40 years of unlabeled Landsat imagery. Unlike autoregressive approaches, STT-LTF directly predicts arbitrary future time points without error accumulation, incorporating spatial patch embeddings, cyclical temporal encoding, and geographic coordinates to learn complex dependencies across heterogeneous Mediterranean ecosystems. Experimental evaluation on Landsat data (1984-2024) demonstrates that STT-LTF achieves a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 0.0328 and R^2 of 0.8412 for next-year predictions, outperforming traditional statistical methods, CNN-based approaches, LSTM networks, and standard transformers. The framework's ability to handle irregular temporal sampling and variable prediction horizons makes it particularly suitable for analysis of heterogeneous landscapes experiencing rapid ecological transitions.", "AI": {"tldr": "STT-LTF\u662f\u4e00\u4e2a\u65f6\u7a7aTransformer\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u7528\u4e8e\u957f\u671f\u536b\u661f\u56fe\u50cf\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u9884\u6d4b\uff0c\u5728\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u5730\u4e2d\u6d77\u666f\u89c2\u4e2d\u8868\u73b0\u4f18\u5f02\uff0c\u76f4\u63a5\u9884\u6d4b\u4efb\u610f\u672a\u6765\u65f6\u95f4\u70b9\uff0c\u65e0\u9700\u81ea\u56de\u5f52\u8bef\u5dee\u7d2f\u79ef\u3002", "motivation": "\u89e3\u51b3\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u5730\u4e2d\u6d77\u666f\u89c2\u4e2d\u957f\u671f\u536b\u661f\u56fe\u50cf\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\u5206\u6790\u7684\u6311\u6218\uff0c\u5305\u62ec\u590d\u6742\u7a7a\u95f4\u6a21\u5f0f\u3001\u5b63\u8282\u53d8\u5316\u548c\u591a\u5e74\u4ee3\u73af\u5883\u53d8\u5316\u5728\u4e0d\u540c\u5c3a\u5ea6\u4e0a\u7684\u76f8\u4e92\u4f5c\u7528\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faSTT-LTF\u6846\u67b6\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u7edf\u4e00Transformer\u67b6\u6784\u5904\u7406\u591a\u5c3a\u5ea6\u7a7a\u95f4\u8865\u4e01\u548c\u957f\u8fbe20\u5e74\u7684\u65f6\u95f4\u5e8f\u5217\uff0c\u7ed3\u5408\u7a7a\u95f4\u63a9\u7801\u3001\u65f6\u95f4\u63a9\u7801\u548c\u6c34\u5e73\u91c7\u6837\u7b56\u7565\u7684\u81ea\u76d1\u7763\u5b66\u4e60\uff0c\u4f7f\u7528\u7a7a\u95f4\u8865\u4e01\u5d4c\u5165\u3001\u5faa\u73af\u65f6\u95f4\u7f16\u7801\u548c\u5730\u7406\u5750\u6807\u3002", "result": "\u5728Landsat\u6570\u636e(1984-2024)\u4e0a\u8bc4\u4f30\uff0cSTT-LTF\u8fbe\u5230MAE 0.0328\u548cR^2 0.8412\u7684\u6b21\u5e74\u9884\u6d4b\u6027\u80fd\uff0c\u4f18\u4e8e\u4f20\u7edf\u7edf\u8ba1\u65b9\u6cd5\u3001CNN\u3001LSTM\u548c\u6807\u51c6Transformer\u3002", "conclusion": "STT-LTF\u80fd\u591f\u5904\u7406\u4e0d\u89c4\u5219\u65f6\u95f4\u91c7\u6837\u548c\u53ef\u53d8\u9884\u6d4b\u6c34\u5e73\uff0c\u7279\u522b\u9002\u7528\u4e8e\u7ecf\u5386\u5feb\u901f\u751f\u6001\u8f6c\u53d8\u7684\u5f02\u8d28\u6027\u5730\u4e2d\u6d77\u666f\u89c2\u5206\u6790\uff0c\u4e3a\u957f\u671f\u73af\u5883\u76d1\u6d4b\u63d0\u4f9b\u4e86\u6709\u6548\u5de5\u5177\u3002"}}

This study introduces Generalizable Predictive Prompt Selection (GPS), which performs Bayesian inference towards prompt difficulty using a lightweight generative model trained on the shared optimization history. Intermediate-difficulty prioritization and history-anchored diversity are incorporated into the batch acquisition principle to select informative prompt batches.

This diversity might induce properties of serendipidity and novelty which might increase user engagement or revenue. However, many real-life problems arise in that case: e.g., avoiding to recommend distinct but too similar items to reduce the churn risk, and computational cost for large item libraries, up to millions of items. First, we consider the case when the user feedback model is perfectly observed and known in advance, and introduce an efficient algorithm called B-DivRec combining determinantal point processes and a fuzzy denuding procedure to adjust the degree of item diversity.

Second, we propose an approach to adaptively tailor the quality-diversity trade-off to the user, so that diversity in recommendations can be enhanced if it leads to positive feedback, and vice-versa.

To generate that exact image, she guides a generative model with multiple rounds of prompting and arrives at an image $x^{p*}$. Although $x^{p*}$ is reasonably close to $x^\\ast$, Alice finds it difficult to close that gap using language prompts. This paper aims to narrow this gap by observing that even after language has reached its limits, humans can still tell when a new image $x^+$ is closer to $x^\\ast$ than $x^{p*}$. Leveraging this observation, we develop MultiBO (Multi-Choice Preferential Bayesian Optimization) that carefully generates $K$ new images as a function of $x^{p*}$, gets preferential feedback from the user, uses the feedback to guide the diffusion model, and ultimately generates a new set of $K$ images. We show that within $B$ rounds of user feedback, it is possible to arrive much closer to $x^\\ast$, even though the generative model has no information about $x^\\ast$. Qualitative scores from $30$ users, combined with quantitative metrics compared across $5$ baselines, show promising results, suggesting that multi-choice feedback from humans can be effectively harnessed for personalized image generation.", "AI": {"tldr": "\u8be5\u8bba\u6587\u63d0\u51faMultiBO\u65b9\u6cd5\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u591a\u8f6e\u7528\u6237\u504f\u597d\u53cd\u9988\u6765\u4f18\u5316\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u89e3\u51b3\u8bed\u8a00\u63d0\u793a\u65e0\u6cd5\u5b8c\u5168\u8868\u8fbe\u7528\u6237\u5fc3\u4e2d\u7279\u5b9a\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u95ee\u9898\u3002", "motivation": "\u5f53\u7528\u6237\u8bd5\u56fe\u7528\u8bed\u8a00\u63d0\u793a\u751f\u6210\u5fc3\u4e2d\u7279\u5b9a\u56fe\u50cf\u65f6\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u7ecf\u8fc7\u591a\u8f6e\u63d0\u793a\uff0c\u751f\u6210\u7684\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0e\u76ee\u6807\u56fe\u50cf\u4ecd\u6709\u5dee\u8ddd\uff0c\u800c\u8bed\u8a00\u63d0\u793a\u96be\u4ee5\u5b8c\u5168\u6d88\u9664\u8fd9\u79cd\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002\u4f46\u4eba\u7c7b\u4ecd\u80fd\u5224\u65ad\u65b0\u56fe\u50cf\u662f\u5426\u6bd4\u5f53\u524d\u56fe\u50cf\u66f4\u63a5\u8fd1\u76ee\u6807\u56fe\u50cf\u3002", "method": "\u63d0\u51faMultiBO\uff08\u591a\u9009\u62e9\u504f\u597d\u8d1d\u53f6\u65af\u4f18\u5316\uff09\u65b9\u6cd5\uff1a1\uff09\u57fa\u4e8e\u5f53\u524d\u6700\u4f73\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210K\u4e2a\u65b0\u56fe\u50cf\uff1b2\uff09\u83b7\u53d6\u7528\u6237\u5bf9\u8fd9\u4e9b\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u504f\u597d\u53cd\u9988\uff1b3\uff09\u5229\u7528\u53cd\u9988\u6307\u5bfc\u6269\u6563\u6a21\u578b\uff1b4\uff09\u751f\u6210\u65b0\u7684K\u4e2a\u56fe\u50cf\u96c6\u3002\u901a\u8fc7B\u8f6e\u7528\u6237\u53cd\u9988\u8fed\u4ee3\u4f18\u5316\u3002", "result": "30\u540d\u7528\u6237\u7684\u5b9a\u6027\u8bc4\u5206\u548c\u4e0e5\u4e2a\u57fa\u7ebf\u7684\u5b9a\u91cf\u6307\u6807\u6bd4\u8f83\u663e\u793a\uff0cMultiBO\u80fd\u5728\u6709\u9650\u53cd\u9988\u8f6e\u6b21\u5185\u663e\u8457\u63a5\u8fd1\u76ee\u6807\u56fe\u50cf\uff0c\u5373\u4f7f\u751f\u6210\u6a21\u578b\u6ca1\u6709\u76ee\u6807\u56fe\u50cf\u7684\u4efb\u4f55\u4fe1\u606f\u3002", "conclusion": "\u591a\u9009\u62e9\u7684\u4eba\u7c7b\u504f\u597d\u53cd\u9988\u53ef\u4ee5\u6709\u6548\u7528\u4e8e\u4e2a\u6027\u5316\u56fe\u50cf\u751f\u6210\uff0c\u901a\u8fc7\u8fed\u4ee3\u4f18\u5316\u8fc7\u7a0b\u80fd\u591f\u663e\u8457\u7f29\u5c0f\u751f\u6210\u56fe\u50cf\u4e0e\u7528\u6237\u5fc3\u4e2d\u76ee\u6807\u56fe\u50cf\u4e4b\u95f4\u7684\u5dee\u8ddd\u3002"}}
