Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving has drawn tremendous attention recently. Many
works focus on using modular deep neural networks to construct the end-to-end
archi-tecture. However, whether using powerful large language models (LLM),
especially multi-modality Vision Language Models (VLM) could benefit the
end-to-end driving tasks remain a question. In our work, we demonstrate that
combining end-to-end architectural design and knowledgeable VLMs yield
impressive performance on the driving tasks. It is worth noting that our method
only uses a single camera and is the best camera-only solution across the
leaderboard, demonstrating the effectiveness of vision-based driving approach
and the potential for end-to-end driving tasks.

Abstract: Multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have shown impressive
generalization across tasks using images and text modalities. While their
extension to video has enabled tasks such as video question answering and video
captioning, their pixel-level visual grounding abilities are less studied. In
this work, we raise the pertinent question of whether motion is used in
pixel-level visual grounding and whether video MLLMs can segment objects based
on natural language expressions describing their motion patterns. We identify
the shortcomings in the current benchmarks, where we show that a single frame
can often suffice for capturing the motion referring expression without any
temporal reasoning. To address this, we introduce four motion-centric probing
techniques, particularly designed for the visual grounding task, to study video
MLLMs' ability to identify true motion from a fake one and their ability to
grasp the motion order. Consequently, we provide a motion-centric benchmark,
MoCentric-Bench. It ensures that video MLLMs are evaluated towards leveraging
the interaction between motion and language rather than being dominated by
static appearance cues emphasized in existing visual grounding datasets. We
further establish strong single-image baselines that are on par with or
outperform prior methods. Finally, we explore simple motion-centric adaptation
techniques that provide state-of-the-art performance on our MoCentric-Bench.
Our motion-centric benchmark, evaluation and findings challenge future models
to improve dense spatiotemporal grounding and pixel-level understanding within
videos. Code and datasets will be made publicly available at

Abstract: Colon cancer also known as Colorectal cancer, is one of the most malignant
types of cancer worldwide. Early-stage detection of colon cancer is highly
crucial to prevent its deterioration. This research presents a hybrid
multi-scale deep learning architecture that synergizes capsule networks, graph
attention mechanisms, transformer modules, and residual learning to advance
colon cancer classification on the Lung and Colon Cancer Histopathological
Image Dataset (LC25000) dataset. The proposed model in this paper utilizes the
HG-TNet model that introduces a hybrid architecture that joins strength points
in transformers and convolutional neural networks to capture multi-scale
features in histopathological images. Mainly, a transformer branch extracts
global contextual bonds by partitioning the image into patches by
convolution-based patch embedding and then processing these patches through a
transformer encoder. Analogously, a dedicated CNN branch captures fine-grained,
local details through successive Incorporation these diverse features, combined
with a self-supervised rotation prediction objective, produce a robust
diagnostic representation that surpasses standard architectures in performance.
Results show better performance not only in accuracy or loss function but also
in these algorithms by utilizing capsule networks to preserve spatial orders
and realize how each element individually combines and forms whole structures.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决主动脉瓣狭窄诊断中超声心动图资源有限的问题，特别是在农村和服务不足地区，点式护理超声受限于操作者专业知识和视图选择困难

Method: 使用强化学习驱动的主动视频采集框架，动态评估是否需要额外成像，优化选择每个患者最具信息量的超声视频

Result: 在2,572名患者数据上测试，仅使用47%的超声视频就实现了80.6%的分类准确率

Conclusion: 主动特征采集方法能够提高主动脉瓣狭窄诊断效率，使超声心动图评估更加高效、可扩展和个性化

Abstract: Aortic stenosis (AS) is a life-threatening condition caused by a narrowing of
the aortic valve, leading to impaired blood flow. Despite its high prevalence,
access to echocardiography (echo), the gold-standard diagnostic tool, is often
limited due to resource constraints, particularly in rural and underserved
areas. Point-of-care ultrasound (POCUS) offers a more accessible alternative
but is restricted by operator expertise and the challenge of selecting the most
relevant imaging views. To address this, we propose a reinforcement learning
(RL)-driven active video acquisition framework that dynamically selects each
patient's most informative echo videos. Unlike traditional methods that rely on
a fixed set of videos, our approach continuously evaluates whether additional
imaging is needed, optimizing both accuracy and efficiency. Tested on data from
2,572 patients, our method achieves 80.6% classification accuracy while using
only 47% of the echo videos compared to a full acquisition. These results
demonstrate the potential of active feature acquisition to enhance AS
diagnosis, making echocardiographic assessments more efficient, scalable, and
personalized. Our source code is available at:

Conclusion: LiGuard框架成功解决了激光雷达研究中的代码重复开发问题，提高了研究效率，促进了代码共享和重用。

Abstract: There is a growing interest in the development of lidar-based autonomous
mobility and Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). To operate and research
on lidar data, researchers often develop code specific to application niche.
This approach leads to duplication of efforts across studies that, in many
cases, share multiple methodological steps such as data input/output (I/O),
pre/post processing, and common algorithms in multi-stage solutions. Moreover,
slight changes in data, algorithms, and/or research focus may force major
revisions in the code. To address these challenges, we present LiGuard, an
open-source software framework that allows researchers to: 1) rapidly develop
code for their lidar-based projects by providing built-in support for data I/O,
pre/post processing, and commonly used algorithms, 2) interactively
add/remove/reorder custom algorithms and adjust their parameters, and 3)
visualize results for classification, detection, segmentation, and tracking
tasks. Moreover, because it creates all the code files in structured
directories, it allows easy sharing of entire projects or even the individual
components to be reused by other researchers. The effectiveness of LiGuard is
demonstrated via case studies.

Abstract: LiDAR-based perception in intelligent transportation systems (ITS), for tasks
such as object detection, tracking, and semantic and instance segmentation, is
predominantly solved by deep neural network models which often require
large-scale labeled datasets during training to achieve generalization.
However, creating these datasets is costly. time consuming and require human
labor before the datasets are ready for training models. This hinders
scalability of the LiDAR-based perception systems in ITS. Sim2Real learning
offers scalable alternative, however, its effectiveness is dependent on the
fidelity of the source simulation(s) to real-world, in terms of environment
structure, actor dynamics, and sensor emulations. In response, this paper
introduces a rigorous and reproducible methodology for creating large-scale,
high-quality synthetic datasets using High-Fidelity Digital Twins (HiFi DTs).
The proposed workflow outlines the steps, tools, and best practices for
digitally replicating real-world environments, encompassing static geometry
modeling, road infrastructure replication, and dynamic traffic scenario
generation. Leveraging open-source and readily available resources such as
satellite imagery and OpenStreetMap data, alongside specific sensor
configurations, this paper provides practical, detailed guidance for
constructing robust synthetic environments. These environments subsequently
facilitate scalable, cost-effective, and diverse dataset generation, forming a
reliable foundation for robust Sim2Real learning.

Conclusion: 高保真数字双胞在智能交通系统中对于实现可靠的模拟基于LiDAR感知具有重要作用，通过精确的环境模拟可以有效缩小Sim2Real间隔。

Abstract: Sim2Real domain transfer offers a cost-effective and scalable approach for
developing LiDAR-based perception (e.g., object detection, tracking,
segmentation) in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). However, perception
models trained in simulation often under perform on real-world data due to
distributional shifts. To address this Sim2Real gap, this paper proposes a
high-fidelity digital twin (HiFi DT) framework that incorporates real-world
background geometry, lane-level road topology, and sensor-specific
specifications and placement. We formalize the domain adaptation challenge
underlying Sim2Real learning and present a systematic method for constructing
simulation environments that yield in-domain synthetic data. An off-the-shelf
3D object detector is trained on HiFi DT-generated synthetic data and evaluated
on real data. Our experiments show that the DT-trained model outperforms the
equivalent model trained on real data by 4.8%. To understand this gain, we
quantify distributional alignment between synthetic and real data using
multiple metrics, including Chamfer Distance (CD), Maximum Mean Discrepancy
(MMD), Earth Mover's Distance (EMD), and Fr'echet Distance (FD), at both
raw-input and latent-feature levels. Results demonstrate that HiFi DTs
substantially reduce domain shift and improve generalization across diverse
evaluation scenarios. These findings underscore the significant role of digital
twins in enabling reliable, simulation-based LiDAR perception for real-world
ITS applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: KG-DG是一个神经符号框架，通过整合视觉变换器和专家指导的符号推理，在糖尿病视网膜病变分类中实现了跨域泛化，准确率提升达5.2%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决医学影像中模型在真实世界分布偏移下泛化能力不足的问题，特别是在糖尿病视网膜病变分类中的域泛化挑战。

Method: 结合视觉变换器和基于临床病变本体的符号推理，通过结构化规则特征和视网膜血管分割，采用置信度加权集成策略融合深度视觉表示，并通过最小化域嵌入的KL散度来实现域对齐。

Result: 在四个公开数据集上实验显示：跨域设置准确率提升5.2%，比基线ViT模型提升6%；纯符号模型在MDG中达到63.67%平均准确率；病变特征方法准确率达84.65%，显著优于纯神经方法。

Conclusion: 神经符号整合是构建临床鲁棒、域不变医学AI系统的有前景范式，符号组件不仅增强可解释性，还能作为有效正则化器。

Abstract: Domain generalization remains a critical challenge in medical imaging, where
models trained on single sources often fail under real-world distribution
shifts. We propose KG-DG, a neuro-symbolic framework for diabetic retinopathy
(DR) classification that integrates vision transformers with expert-guided
symbolic reasoning to enable robust generalization across unseen domains. Our
approach leverages clinical lesion ontologies through structured, rule-based
features and retinal vessel segmentation, fusing them with deep visual
representations via a confidence-weighted integration strategy. The framework
addresses both single-domain generalization (SDG) and multi-domain
generalization (MDG) by minimizing the KL divergence between domain embeddings,
thereby enforcing alignment of high-level clinical semantics. Extensive
experiments across four public datasets (APTOS, EyePACS, Messidor-1,
Messidor-2) demonstrate significant improvements: up to a 5.2% accuracy gain in
cross-domain settings and a 6% improvement over baseline ViT models. Notably,
our symbolic-only model achieves a 63.67% average accuracy in MDG, while the
complete neuro-symbolic integration achieves the highest accuracy compared to
existing published baselines and benchmarks in challenging SDG scenarios.
Ablation studies reveal that lesion-based features (84.65% accuracy)
substantially outperform purely neural approaches, confirming that symbolic
components act as effective regularizers beyond merely enhancing
interpretability. Our findings establish neuro-symbolic integration as a
promising paradigm for building clinically robust, and domain-invariant medical
AI systems.

Conclusion: STAR作为开源轻量级工具，为临床采用降低了门槛，并为下一代计算病理学的大规模配对数据准备提供了可复现的基线

Abstract: Registration of serial whole-slide histopathological images (WSIs) is
critical for enabling direct comparison across diverse stains and for preparing
paired datasets in artificial intelligence (AI) workflows such as virtual
staining and biomarker prediction. While existing methods often rely on complex
deformable or deep learning approaches that are computationally intensive and
difficult to reproduce, lightweight rigid frameworks-sufficient for many
consecutive-section scenarios-remain underdeveloped. We introduce STAR (Serial
Tissue Alignment for Rigid registration), a fast and robust open-source
framework for multi-WSI alignment. STAR integrates stain-conditioned
preprocessing with a hierarchical coarse-to-fine correlation strategy, adaptive
kernel scaling, and built-in quality control, achieving reliable rigid
registration across heterogeneous tissue types and staining protocols,
including hematoxylin-eosin (H&E), special histochemical stains (e.g., PAS,
PASM, Masson's), and immunohistochemical (IHC) markers (e.g., CD31, KI67).
Evaluated on the ANHIR 2019 and ACROBAT 2022 datasets spanning multiple organs
and scanning conditions, STAR consistently produced stable alignments within
minutes per slide, demonstrating robustness to cross-stain variability and
partial tissue overlap. Beyond benchmarks, we present case studies on H&E-IHC
alignment, construction of multi-IHC panels, and typical failure modes,
underscoring both utility and limitations. Released as an open and lightweight
tool, STAR provides a reproducible baseline that lowers the barrier for
clinical adoption and enables large-scale paired data preparation for
next-generation computational pathology.

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了多模态工业缺陷检测中的模态缺失问题，通过创新的提示学习和对比学习机制显著提升了检测性能。

Abstract: Multimodal industrial surface defect detection (MISDD) aims to identify and
locate defect in industrial products by fusing RGB and 3D modalities. This
article focuses on modality-missing problems caused by uncertain sensors
availability in MISDD. In this context, the fusion of multiple modalities
encounters several troubles, including learning mode transformation and
information vacancy. To this end, we first propose cross-modal prompt learning,
which includes: i) the cross-modal consistency prompt serves the establishment
of information consistency of dual visual modalities; ii) the modality-specific
prompt is inserted to adapt different input patterns; iii) the missing-aware
prompt is attached to compensate for the information vacancy caused by dynamic
modalities-missing. In addition, we propose symmetric contrastive learning,
which utilizes text modality as a bridge for fusion of dual vision modalities.
Specifically, a paired antithetical text prompt is designed to generate binary
text semantics, and triple-modal contrastive pre-training is offered to
accomplish multimodal learning. Experiment results show that our proposed
method achieves 73.83% I-AUROC and 93.05% P-AUROC with a total missing rate 0.7
for RGB and 3D modalities (exceeding state-of-the-art methods 3.84% and 5.58%
respectively), and outperforms existing approaches to varying degrees under
different missing types and rates. The source code will be available at

### [12] [EdgeAttNet: Towards Barb-Aware Filament Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02964)
*Victor Solomon,Piet Martens,Jingyu Liu,Rafal Angryk*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: EdgeAttNet是一种基于U-Net的太阳灯丝分割架构，通过引入可学习的边缘图来增强自注意力机制，显著提升了细尺度灯丝结构（特别是倒钩）的分割精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在H-alpha观测中难以捕捉太阳灯丝的细尺度结构，特别是倒钩结构，主要原因是缺乏对长距离依赖关系和空间细节的建模能力。

Method: 在U-Net骨干网络上引入从输入图像直接推导的可学习边缘图，通过将边缘信息线性变换到注意力Key和Query矩阵中，指导瓶颈处的自注意力机制更有效地捕捉灯丝边界和倒钩结构。

Result: 在MAGFILO数据集上，EdgeAttNet超越了U-Net和其他基于U-Net的transformer基线，实现了更高的分割精度和显著更好的倒钩识别能力，同时推理速度更快。

Conclusion: 通过将结构先验显式整合到注意力计算中，EdgeAttNet在减少可训练参数的同时增强了空间敏感性和分割精度，适合实际部署应用。

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of solar filaments in H-alpha observations is critical
for determining filament chirality, a key factor in the behavior of Coronal
Mass Ejections (CMEs). However, existing methods often fail to capture
fine-scale filament structures, particularly barbs, due to a limited ability to
model long-range dependencies and spatial detail.
  We propose EdgeAttNet, a segmentation architecture built on a U-Net backbone
by introducing a novel, learnable edge map derived directly from the input
image. This edge map is incorporated into the model by linearly transforming
the attention Key and Query matrices with the edge information, thereby guiding
the self-attention mechanism at the network's bottleneck to more effectively
capture filament boundaries and barbs. By explicitly integrating this
structural prior into the attention computations, EdgeAttNet enhances spatial
sensitivity and segmentation accuracy while reducing the number of trainable
parameters.
  Trained end-to-end, EdgeAttNet outperforms U-Net and other U-Net-based
transformer baselines on the MAGFILO dataset. It achieves higher segmentation
accuracy and significantly better recognition of filament barbs, with faster
inference performance suitable for practical deployment.

Abstract: Accurate short-horizon trajectory prediction is pivotal for safe and reliable
autonomous driving, yet existing vision-language models (VLMs) often fail to
effectively ground their reasoning in scene dynamics and domain knowledge. To
address this challenge, this paper introduces KEPT, a knowledge-enhanced VLM
framework that predicts ego trajectories directly from consecutive front-view
driving frames. KEPT couples a temporal frequency-spatial fusion (TFSF) video
encoder, trained via self-supervised learning with hard-negative mining, with a
scalable k-means + HNSW retrieval stack that supplies scene-aligned exemplars.
Retrieved priors are embedded into chain-of-thought (CoT) prompts with explicit
planning constraints, while a triple-stage fine-tuning schedule incrementally
aligns the language head to metric spatial cues, physically feasible motion,
and temporally conditioned front-view planning. Evaluated on nuScenes dataset,
KEPT achieves state-of-the-art performance across open-loop protocols: under
NoAvg, it achieves 0.70m average L2 with a 0.21\% collision rate; under TemAvg
with lightweight ego status, it attains 0.31m average L2 and a 0.07\% collision
rate. Ablation studies show that all three fine-tuning stages contribute
complementary benefits, and that using Top-2 retrieved exemplars yields the
best accuracy-safety trade-off. The k-means-clustered HNSW index delivers
sub-millisecond retrieval latency, supporting practical deployment. These
results indicate that retrieval-augmented, CoT-guided VLMs offer a promising,
data-efficient pathway toward interpretable and trustworthy autonomous driving.

*Xianbao Hou,Yonghao He,Zeyd Boukhers,John See,Hu Su,Wei Sui,Cong Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: InstaDA是一个无需训练的双智能体系统，通过文本智能体和图像智能体协作增强实例分割数据集，显著提升性能指标


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决实例分割数据标注成本高、类别不平衡的问题，以及现有方法中大型语言模型与扩散模型缺乏深度协作、未充分利用训练数据信息的局限性

Method: 提出双智能体系统：1) 文本智能体(T-Agent)通过LLM与扩散模型协作，采用Prompt Rethink机制迭代优化提示词；2) 图像智能体(I-Agent)基于训练图像生成新实例来丰富数据分布。两个智能体都是独立自动的工作流

Result: 在LVIS 1.0验证集上，相比基线方法提升box AP +4.0和mask AP +3.3，优于领先模型DiverGen（box AP +0.3，mask AP +0.1），在常见类别上表现尤其突出

Conclusion: InstaDA通过双智能体协作有效解决了实例分割数据增强问题，无需训练即可显著提升模型性能，证明了LLM与扩散模型深度协作的价值

Abstract: Acquiring high-quality instance segmentation data is challenging due to the
labor-intensive nature of the annotation process and significant class
imbalances within datasets. Recent studies have utilized the integration of
Copy-Paste and diffusion models to create more diverse datasets. However, these
studies often lack deep collaboration between large language models (LLMs) and
diffusion models, and underutilize the rich information within the existing
training data. To address these limitations, we propose InstaDA, a novel,
training-free Dual-Agent system designed to augment instance segmentation
datasets. First, we introduce a Text-Agent (T-Agent) that enhances data
diversity through collaboration between LLMs and diffusion models. This agent
features a novel Prompt Rethink mechanism, which iteratively refines prompts
based on the generated images. This process not only fosters collaboration but
also increases image utilization and optimizes the prompts themselves.
Additionally, we present an Image-Agent (I-Agent) aimed at enriching the
overall data distribution. This agent augments the training set by generating
new instances conditioned on the training images. To ensure practicality and
efficiency, both agents operate as independent and automated workflows,
enhancing usability. Experiments conducted on the LVIS 1.0 validation set
indicate that InstaDA achieves significant improvements, with an increase of
+4.0 in box average precision (AP) and +3.3 in mask AP compared to the
baseline. Furthermore, it outperforms the leading model, DiverGen, by +0.3 in
box AP and +0.1 in mask AP, with a notable +0.7 gain in box AP on common
categories and mask AP gains of +0.2 on common categories and +0.5 on frequent
categories.

Motivation: 传统的基于原型的少样本医学图像分割方法通常为支持图像生成单一全局原型来匹配查询图像，忽略了类内变化，导致性能受限

Method: 提出SPENet网络，包含多级原型生成模块（同时生成全局原型和自适应数量的局部原型）和查询引导的局部原型增强模块（根据查询图像自适应优化支持原型）

Conclusion: SPENet通过多粒度原型匹配和查询引导的原型增强，有效解决了少样本医学图像分割中的类内变化问题，显著提升了分割性能

Abstract: Few-Shot Medical Image Segmentation (FSMIS) aims to segment novel classes of
medical objects using only a few labeled images. Prototype-based methods have
made significant progress in addressing FSMIS. However, they typically generate
a single global prototype for the support image to match with the query image,
overlooking intra-class variations. To address this issue, we propose a
Self-guided Prototype Enhancement Network (SPENet). Specifically, we introduce
a Multi-level Prototype Generation (MPG) module, which enables
multi-granularity measurement between the support and query images by
simultaneously generating a global prototype and an adaptive number of local
prototypes. Additionally, we observe that not all local prototypes in the
support image are beneficial for matching, especially when there are
substantial discrepancies between the support and query images. To alleviate
this issue, we propose a Query-guided Local Prototype Enhancement (QLPE)
module, which adaptively refines support prototypes by incorporating guidance
from the query image, thus mitigating the negative effects of such
discrepancies. Extensive experiments on three public medical datasets
demonstrate that SPENet outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods,
achieving superior performance.

Abstract: Extracting small objects from remote sensing imagery plays a vital role in
various applications, including urban planning, environmental monitoring, and
disaster management. While current research primarily focuses on small object
detection, instance segmentation for small objects remains underexplored, with
no dedicated datasets available. This gap stems from the technical challenges
and high costs of pixel-level annotation for small objects. While the Segment
Anything Model (SAM) demonstrates impressive zero-shot generalization, its
performance on small-object segmentation deteriorates significantly, largely
due to the coarse 1/16 feature resolution that causes severe loss of fine
spatial details. To this end, we propose SOPSeg, a prompt-based framework
specifically designed for small object segmentation in remote sensing imagery.
It incorporates a region-adaptive magnification strategy to preserve
fine-grained details, and employs a customized decoder that integrates edge
prediction and progressive refinement for accurate boundary delineation.
Moreover, we introduce a novel prompting mechanism tailored to the oriented
bounding boxes widely adopted in remote sensing applications. SOPSeg
outperforms existing methods in small object segmentation and facilitates
efficient dataset construction for remote sensing tasks. We further construct a
comprehensive small object instance segmentation dataset based on SODA-A, and
will release both the model and dataset to support future research.

Motivation: 现有的深度水印研究主要关注处理中水印，而后处理水印更具灵活性，可应用于任何生成模型的输出且无需了解模型内部结构，还能为单个图像嵌入独特水印。

Method: 构建基于CNN和Transformer的集成攻击网络，在空间域和频域进行多种组合，研究不同组合对水印模型鲁棒性的影响。

Conclusion: 集成攻击网络训练能显著增强后处理水印方法的鲁棒性，空间-频域CNN-Transformer组合是最有效的攻击网络配置。

Abstract: Recent studies on deep watermarking have predominantly focused on
in-processing watermarking, which integrates the watermarking process into
image generation. However, post-processing watermarking, which embeds
watermarks after image generation, offers more flexibility. It can be applied
to outputs from any generative model (e.g. GANs, diffusion models) without
needing access to the model's internal structure. It also allows users to embed
unique watermarks into individual images. Therefore, this study focuses on
post-processing watermarking and enhances its robustness by incorporating an
ensemble attack network during training. We construct various versions of
attack networks using CNN and Transformer in both spatial and frequency domains
to investigate how each combination influences the robustness of the
watermarking model. Our results demonstrate that combining a CNN-based attack
network in the spatial domain with a Transformer-based attack network in the
frequency domain yields the highest robustness in watermarking models.
Extensive evaluation on the WAVES benchmark, using average bit accuracy as the
metric, demonstrates that our ensemble attack network significantly enhances
the robustness of baseline watermarking methods under various stress tests. In
particular, for the Regeneration Attack defined in WAVES, our method improves
StegaStamp by 18.743%. The code is released

Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型在处理视觉和文本输入时，经常错误地将缺乏视觉证据的文本输入视为图像的一部分，导致错误响应。需要解决这种视觉缺失感知问题。

Method: 识别出特定的视觉缺失感知(VA)神经元，开发检测模块来分类输入token是否具有视觉基础，并基于预测结果重新解释问题提示或在生成过程中替换检测到的缺失token。

Conclusion: 通过识别和利用VA神经元的激活模式，可以系统性地检测视觉缺失并优化模型输出，提高大型视觉语言模型的准确性。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) generate contextually relevant responses
by jointly interpreting visual and textual inputs. However, our finding reveals
they often mistakenly perceive text inputs lacking visual evidence as being
part of the image, leading to erroneous responses. In light of this finding, we
probe whether LVLMs possess an internal capability to determine if textual
concepts are grounded in the image, and discover a specific subset of
Feed-Forward Network (FFN) neurons, termed Visual Absence-aware (VA) neurons,
that consistently signal the visual absence through a distinctive activation
pattern. Leveraging these patterns, we develop a detection module that
systematically classifies whether an input token is visually grounded. Guided
by its prediction, we propose a method to refine the outputs by reinterpreting
question prompts or replacing the detected absent tokens during generation.
Extensive experiments show that our method effectively mitigates the models'
tendency to falsely presume the visual presence of text input and its
generality across various LVLMs.

Conclusion: 背景语义在行人重识别中与前景语义同等重要，提出的联合建模框架能够有效抑制背景噪声并增强对身份相关前景线索的关注

Abstract: Person re-identification faces two core challenges: precisely locating the
foreground target while suppressing background noise and extracting
fine-grained features from the target region. Numerous visual-only approaches
address these issues by partitioning an image and applying attention modules,
yet they rely on costly manual annotations and struggle with complex
occlusions. Recent multimodal methods, motivated by CLIP, introduce semantic
cues to guide visual understanding. However, they focus solely on foreground
information, but overlook the potential value of background cues. Inspired by
human perception, we argue that background semantics are as important as the
foreground semantics in ReID, as humans tend to eliminate background
distractions while focusing on target appearance. Therefore, this paper
proposes an end-to-end framework that jointly models foreground and background
information within a dual-branch cross-modal feature extraction pipeline. To
help the network distinguish between the two domains, we propose an
intra-semantic alignment and inter-semantic adversarial learning strategy.
Specifically, we align visual and textual features that share the same
semantics across domains, while simultaneously penalizing similarity between
foreground and background features to enhance the network's discriminative
power. This strategy drives the model to actively suppress noisy background
regions and enhance attention toward identity-relevant foreground cues.
Comprehensive experiments on two holistic and two occluded ReID benchmarks
demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of the proposed method, with
results that match or surpass those of current state-of-the-art approaches.

Abstract: Accurate skin-lesion segmentation remains a key technical challenge for

Mobile Inverted Bottleneck blocks to curb computation, inserts a
bottleneck-level cross-scale token-mixing unit to exchange information between

Conclusion: 动态条件方法显著优于传统静态条件控制，能够有效处理多任务场景下的挑战，特别是在训练数据缺乏的不良问题中。

Abstract: Conditional diffusion models have made impressive progress in the field of
image processing, but the characteristics of constructing data distribution
pathways make it difficult to exploit the intrinsic correlation between tasks
in multi-task scenarios, which is even worse in ill-posed tasks with a lack of
training data. In addition, traditional static condition control makes it
difficult for networks to learn in multi-task scenarios with its dynamically
evolving characteristics. To address these challenges, we propose a dynamic
conditional double diffusion bridge training paradigm to build a general
framework for ill-posed multi-tasks. Firstly, this paradigm decouples the
diffusion and condition generation processes, avoiding the dependence of the
diffusion model on supervised data in ill-posed tasks. Secondly, generated by
the same noise schedule, dynamic conditions are used to gradually adjust their
statistical characteristics, naturally embed time-related information, and
reduce the difficulty of network learning. We analyze the learning objectives
of the network under different conditional forms in the single-step denoising
process and compare the changes in its attention weights in the network,
demonstrating the superiority of our dynamic conditions. Taking dehazing and
visible-infrared fusion as typical ill-posed multi-task scenarios, we achieve
the best performance in multiple indicators on public datasets. The code has
been publicly released at: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/DCDB-D3C2.

Abstract: Handwritten characters can be trickier to classify due to their complex and
cursive nature compared to simple and non-cursive characters. We present an
external classifier along with a Generative Adversarial Network that can
classify highly cursive and complex characters. The generator network produces
fake handwritten character images, which are then used to augment the training
data after adding adversarially perturbed noise and achieving a confidence
score above a threshold with the discriminator network. The results show that
the accuracy of convolutional neural networks decreases as character complexity
increases, but our proposed model, ADA-GAN, remains more robust and effective
for both cursive and complex characters.

Abstract: Intracranial aneurysms pose a significant clinical risk yet are difficult to

cross-domain feature-transfer approach that leverages the latent geometric
embeddings learned by TRELLIS, a generative model trained on large-scale
non-medical 3D datasets, to augment neural networks for aneurysm analysis. By
replacing conventional point normals or mesh descriptors with TRELLIS surface
features, we systematically enhance three downstream tasks: (i) classifying
aneurysms versus healthy vessels in the Intra3D dataset, (ii) segmenting
aneurysm and vessel regions on 3D meshes, and (iii) predicting time-evolving
blood-flow fields using a graph neural network on the AnXplore dataset. Our
experiments show that the inclusion of these features yields strong gains in
accuracy, F1-score and segmentation quality over state-of-the-art baselines,
and reduces simulation error by 15\%. These results illustrate the broader
potential of transferring 3D representations from general-purpose generative

Abstract: Face recognition systems are robust against environmental changes and noise,
and thus may be vulnerable to illegal authentication attempts using user face
photos, such as spoofing attacks. To prevent such spoofing attacks, it is
crucial to discriminate whether the input image is a live user image or a
spoofed image prior to the face recognition process. Most existing spoofing
attack detection methods utilize deep learning, which necessitates a
substantial amount of training data. Consequently, if malicious data is
injected into a portion of the training dataset, a specific spoofing attack may
be erroneously classified as live, leading to false positives.In this paper, we
propose a novel backdoor poisoning attack method to demonstrate the latent
threat of backdoor poisoning within face anti-spoofing detection. The proposed
method enables certain spoofing attacks to bypass detection by embedding
features extracted from the spoofing attack's face image into a live face image
without inducing any perceptible visual alterations.Through experiments
conducted on public datasets, we demonstrate that the proposed method
constitutes a realistic threat to existing spoofing attack detection systems.

*Jialu Li,Chen Wu,Meiqi Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CAIM-Net是一个时间序列变化检测网络，通过从变化时刻推断变化区域，确保变化区域和变化时刻结果的一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习方法将变化区域检测和变化时刻识别作为独立任务处理，但变化区域可以从变化时刻推断出来，因此需要确保两者结果的一致性。

Method: CAIM-Net包含三个关键步骤：差异提取与增强、粗粒度变化时刻提取、细粒度变化时刻提取与变化区域推断。使用轻量级编码器提取差异特征，通过边界增强卷积放大特征，进行时空相关性分析，最后利用多尺度时间类激活映射模块推断变化区域。

Result: 该方法能够同时指示变化发生的位置和时间，确保变化区域和变化时刻检测结果的一致性。

Conclusion: CAIM-Net通过从变化时刻推断变化区域的方法，有效解决了时间序列变化检测中变化区域和变化时刻结果不一致的问题，为生态系统动态监测提供了更可靠的技术支持。

Abstract: Time series change detection is a critical task for exploring ecosystem
dynamics using time series remote sensing images, because it can simultaneously
indicate where and when change occur. While deep learning has shown excellent
performance in this domain, it continues to approach change area detection and
change moment identification as distinct tasks. Given that change area can be
inferred from change moment, we propose a time series change detection network,
named CAIM-Net (Change Area Inference from Moment Network), to ensure
consistency between change area and change moment results. CAIM-Net infers
change area from change moment based on the intrinsic relationship between time
series analysis and spatial change detection. The CAIM-Net comprises three key
steps: Difference Extraction and Enhancement, Coarse Change Moment Extraction,
and Fine Change Moment Extraction and Change Area Inference. In the Difference
Extraction and Enhancement, a lightweight encoder with batch dimension stacking
is designed to rapidly extract difference features. Subsequently, boundary
enhancement convolution is applied to amplify these difference features. In the
Coarse Change Moment Extraction, the enhanced difference features from the
first step are used to spatiotemporal correlation analysis, and then two
distinct methods are employed to determine coarse change moments. In the Fine
Change Moment Extraction and Change Area Inference, a multiscale temporal Class
Activation Mapping (CAM) module first increases the weight of the
change-occurring moment from coarse change moments. Then the weighted change
moment is used to infer change area based on the fact that pixels with the
change moment must have undergone a change.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出基于梯度自反思的token影响估计方法，通过影响感知对比解码框架同时缓解多模态大语言模型中的文本-视觉偏差和共现偏差，无需额外资源即可有效减少幻觉现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型存在文本-视觉偏差和共现偏差导致的幻觉问题，现有方法缺乏对实例间偏差水平波动的理解，需要一种无需额外资源的有效缓解方案。

Method: 使用梯度自反思方法估计不同token类型（视觉、提示、先前输出）的影响，检测目标相关视觉token，并将其整合到影响感知对比解码框架中。

Result: 在LLaVA-QA90上实现高达92%的准确率提升，有效减少幻觉现象。

Conclusion: 该方法能够同时缓解两种偏差类型，无需额外微调、模型或数据统计，为多模态大语言模型的幻觉问题提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Hallucinations in multimodal large language model are caused by the
text-visual bias and the co-occurrence bias. The former reflects an
over-reliance on text information in the decision-making process, while the
latter arises from the statistical object-pairing patterns abstracted from the
training data. Existing mitigation methods heuristically address these biases
without understanding the fluctuating bias level across the instances. We first
propose estimating the influence of respective token types (visual, prompt, and
previous outputs) using a gradient-based self-reflection method. The estimated
token influence further enables the detection of object-related visual tokens
and their integration into an influence-aware contrastive decoding framework to
mitigate both types of biases simultaneously. Our method operates without the
need for additional resources, such as costly fine-tuning, extra models, or
data statistics. Extensive experiments show it effectively reduces
hallucinations, achieving up to a 92% accuracy increase on LLaVA-QA90.

TL;DR: 提出GravityDB方法，通过引力场驱动的扩散桥模拟可变性手部表面与刚性物体的交互，解决现有方法中的穿透、间隙和变形捕捉问题，并引入文本语义指导生成更符合语义的交互区域。

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有手-物体姿态估计方法在复杂几何交互中容易产生穿透、接触区域间隙，且难以捕捉手部表面的真实变形，需要更物理合理且语义指导的交互模拟方法。

Method: 将手-物体交互建模为引力场驱动过程，使用基于引力场的扩散桥(GravityDB)模拟可变性手部表面与刚性物体的交互，并引入文本语义信息指导引力场构建。

Result: 在多个数据集上的定性和定量实验表明，该方法能生成无穿透、稳定抓握且捕捉真实手部变形的物理合理交互，同时语义指导使交互区域更具语义意义。

Conclusion: GravityDB方法有效解决了手-物体交互中的穿透、间隙和变形问题，通过引力场驱动和语义指导实现了更真实和语义合理的交互模拟。

Abstract: Existing reconstruction or hand-object pose estimation methods are capable of
producing coarse interaction states. However, due to the complex and diverse
geometry of both human hands and objects, these approaches often suffer from
interpenetration or leave noticeable gaps in regions that are supposed to be in
contact. Moreover, the surface of a real human hand undergoes non-negligible
deformations during interaction, which are difficult to capture and represent
with previous methods. To tackle these challenges, we formulate hand-object
interaction as an attraction-driven process and propose a Gravity-Field Based
Diffusion Bridge (GravityDB) to simulate interactions between a deformable hand
surface and rigid objects. Our approach effectively resolves the aforementioned
issues by generating physically plausible interactions that are free of
interpenetration, ensure stable grasping, and capture realistic hand
deformations. Furthermore, we incorporate semantic information from textual
descriptions to guide the construction of the gravitational field, enabling
more semantically meaningful interaction regions. Extensive qualitative and
quantitative experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of
our method.

Motivation: 现有方法存在三个主要局限：无法明确捕捉时间间隔与结构变化的关系、仅能进行扫描插值缺乏临床实用性、大多基于2D架构忽略3D解剖上下文。需要开发能够准确预测脑部未来病理进展的3D方法

Method: 提出3D时间感知扩散模型(TADM-3D)，使用预训练的脑龄估计器(BAE)指导扩散模型生成反映预期年龄差异的MRI。引入回溯时间正则化(BITR)，通过双向训练(前向和后向)提高时间准确性

Conclusion: TADM-3D能够准确预测脑部MRI的进展，通过脑龄估计器引导和双向正则化提高了时间准确性，代码将在接受后提供

Abstract: Generating realistic MRIs to accurately predict future changes in the
structure of brain is an invaluable tool for clinicians in assessing clinical
outcomes and analysing the disease progression at the patient level. However,
current existing methods present some limitations: (i) some approaches fail to
explicitly capture the relationship between structural changes and time
intervals, especially when trained on age-imbalanced datasets; (ii) others rely
only on scan interpolation, which lack clinical utility, as they generate
intermediate images between timepoints rather than future pathological
progression; and (iii) most approaches rely on 2D slice-based architectures,
thereby disregarding full 3D anatomical context, which is essential for
accurate longitudinal predictions. We propose a 3D Temporally-Aware Diffusion
Model (TADM-3D), which accurately predicts brain progression on MRI volumes. To
better model the relationship between time interval and brain changes, TADM-3D
uses a pre-trained Brain-Age Estimator (BAE) that guides the diffusion model in
the generation of MRIs that accurately reflect the expected age difference
between baseline and generated follow-up scans. Additionally, to further
improve the temporal awareness of TADM-3D, we propose the Back-In-Time
Regularisation (BITR), by training TADM-3D to predict bidirectionally from the
baseline to follow-up (forward), as well as from the follow-up to baseline
(backward). Although predicting past scans has limited clinical applications,
this regularisation helps the model generate temporally more accurate scans. We
train and evaluate TADM-3D on the OASIS-3 dataset, and we validate the
generalisation performance on an external test set from the NACC dataset. The
code will be available upon acceptance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了两种新颖的损失函数（负中心线损失和简化拓扑损失）来保持生物医学分割中细长结构的连续性，特别适用于信号丢失情况下的轴突起始段分割任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在生物医学分割任务中，保持细长结构的连续性和长度比体素级精度更重要，特别是对于容易因信号丢失而产生不连续性的轴突起始段分割。

Method: 使用卷积神经网络，结合新提出的负中心线损失和简化拓扑损失函数，并采用下采样和间距校正等实验设计策略来获得连续的分割掩码。

Result: 与标准CNN和现有拓扑感知损失相比，该方法显著减少了每个实例的分割不连续性数量，特别是在输入信号缺失区域，改善了实例长度计算的准确性。

Conclusion: 在损失函数设计中嵌入结构先验可以显著提高生物应用分割的可靠性，特别是在需要保持结构连续性的任务中。

Abstract: In many biomedical segmentation tasks, the preservation of elongated
structure continuity and length is more important than voxel-wise accuracy. We
propose two novel loss functions, Negative Centerline Loss and Simplified
Topology Loss, that, applied to Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), help
preserve connectivity of output instances. Moreover, we discuss characteristics
of experiment design, such as downscaling and spacing correction, that help
obtain continuous segmentation masks. We evaluate our approach on a 3D
light-sheet fluorescence microscopy dataset of axon initial segments (AIS), a
task prone to discontinuity due to signal dropout. Compared to standard CNNs
and existing topology-aware losses, our methods reduce the number of
segmentation discontinuities per instance, particularly in regions with missing
input signal, resulting in improved instance length calculation in downstream
applications. Our findings demonstrate that structural priors embedded in the
loss design can significantly enhance the reliability of segmentation for
biological applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决人群密度估计任务中需要精细位置标注的痛点，传统方法需要为每个人标注位置点，耗时耗力且难以扩展

Method: 使用历史地图库存储预测结果生成伪密度图，采用超几何分布采样位置，结合无监督显著性估计提供空间先验，并添加自监督对比空间正则化器

Conclusion: Count2Density成功证明了仅使用计数级标注就能训练出具有空间感知能力的密度估计模型，为实际应用提供了可扩展的解决方案

Abstract: Crowd density estimation is a well-known computer vision task aimed at
estimating the density distribution of people in an image. The main challenge
in this domain is the reliance on fine-grained location-level annotations,
(i.e. points placed on top of each individual) to train deep networks.
Collecting such detailed annotations is both tedious, time-consuming, and poses
a significant barrier to scalability for real-world applications. To alleviate
this burden, we present Count2Density: a novel pipeline designed to predict
meaningful density maps containing quantitative spatial information using only
count-level annotations (i.e., total number of people) during training. To
achieve this, Count2Density generates pseudo-density maps leveraging past
predictions stored in a Historical Map Bank, thereby reducing confirmation
bias. This bank is initialised using an unsupervised saliency estimator to
provide an initial spatial prior and is iteratively updated with an EMA of
predicted density maps. These pseudo-density maps are obtained by sampling
locations from estimated crowd areas using a hypergeometric distribution, with
the number of samplings determined by the count-level annotations. To further
enhance the spatial awareness of the model, we add a self-supervised
contrastive spatial regulariser to encourage similar feature representations
within crowded regions while maximising dissimilarity with background regions.
Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms
cross-domain adaptation methods and achieves better results than recent
state-of-the-art approaches in semi-supervised settings across several
datasets. Additional analyses validate the effectiveness of each individual
component of our pipeline, confirming the ability of Count2Density to
effectively retrieve spatial information from count-level annotations and
enabling accurate subregion counting.

Method: 创建军事车辆数据集MilCivVeh，实施改进版BadDet表征毒性攻击，并测试专门检测方法和异常检测方法，最终提出自己的自动编码器基础方法AutoDetect

Result: 毒性攻击虽然可以实现正向攻击成功率，但需要毒化大量数据，实际应用性受限，新方法AutoDetect在分离清洁和毒化样本方面表现优异，更节省时间和内存

Abstract: Poisoning attacks pose an increasing threat to the security and robustness of
Artificial Intelligence systems in the military domain. The widespread use of
open-source datasets and pretrained models exacerbates this risk. Despite the
severity of this threat, there is limited research on the application and
detection of poisoning attacks on object detection systems. This is especially
problematic in the military domain, where attacks can have grave consequences.
In this work, we both investigate the effect of poisoning attacks on military
object detectors in practice, and the best approach to detect these attacks. To
support this research, we create a small, custom dataset featuring military
vehicles: MilCivVeh. We explore the vulnerability of military object detectors
for poisoning attacks by implementing a modified version of the BadDet attack:
a patch-based poisoning attack. We then assess its impact, finding that while a
positive attack success rate is achievable, it requires a substantial portion
of the data to be poisoned -- raising questions about its practical
applicability. To address the detection challenge, we test both specialized
poisoning detection methods and anomaly detection methods from the visual
industrial inspection domain. Since our research shows that both classes of
methods are lacking, we introduce our own patch detection method: AutoDetect, a
simple, fast, and lightweight autoencoder-based method. Our method shows
promising results in separating clean from poisoned samples using the
reconstruction error of image slices, outperforming existing methods, while
being less time- and memory-intensive. We urge that the availability of large,
representative datasets in the military domain is a prerequisite to further
evaluate risks of poisoning attacks and opportunities patch detection.

TL;DR: 基于强化学习的PPORLD-EDNetLDCT方法，通过PPO算法优化去噪策略，在LDCT图像去噪中获得了更高的PSNR、SSIM和更低的RMSE，并在新冠病毒分类任务中提升了准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低强度CT扩散成像（LDCT）在减少辐射暴露的同时带来了噪声增加和图像质量下降的问题。传统的迭代优化或监督学习方法在保持图像质量方面存在不足，需要一种更有效的去噪方法。

Method: 提出了PPORLD-EDNetLDCT方法，这是一种基于强化学习的编码器-解码器网络。该方法采用进阶的后颈策略优化（PPO）算法，基于图像质量反馈实时优化去噪策略，通过自定义的gym环境进行训练。

Result: 在低强度CT图像和投影数据集上，该方法的峰值信噪比达到41.87，结构相似性指数为0.9814，均方根误差为0.00236。在NIH-AAPM-Mayo Clinic低强度CT挑战数据集上获得了PSNR 41.52、SSIM 0.9723和RMSE 0.0051。在新冠病毒LDCT数据集的分类任务中，该方法将分类准确率提升到94%，比无RL去噪的方法提高4%。

Conclusion: PPORLD-EDNetLDCT方法为LDCT成像提供了一种更安全和更准确的解决方案，通过强化学习策略优化在去噪效果和图像质量保持方面都取得了显著改善。

Abstract: Low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) is critical for minimizing radiation
exposure, but it often leads to increased noise and reduced image quality.
Traditional denoising methods, such as iterative optimization or supervised
learning, often fail to preserve image quality. To address these challenges, we
introduce PPORLD-EDNetLDCT, a reinforcement learning-based (RL) approach with
Encoder-Decoder for LDCT. Our method utilizes a dynamic RL-based approach in
which an advanced posterior policy optimization (PPO) algorithm is used to
optimize denoising policies in real time, based on image quality feedback,
trained via a custom gym environment. The experimental results on the low dose
CT image and projection dataset demonstrate that the proposed PPORLD-EDNetLDCT
model outperforms traditional denoising techniques and other DL-based methods,
achieving a peak signal-to-noise ratio of 41.87, a structural similarity index
measure of 0.9814 and a root mean squared error of 0.00236. Moreover, in
NIH-AAPM-Mayo Clinic Low Dose CT Challenge dataset our method achived a PSNR of
41.52, SSIM of 0.9723 and RMSE of 0.0051. Furthermore, we validated the quality
of denoising using a classification task in the COVID-19 LDCT dataset, where
the images processed by our method improved the classification accuracy to
94\%, achieving 4\% higher accuracy compared to denoising without RL-based
denoising. This method offers a promising solution for safer and more accurate
LDCT imaging.

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly improved
natural language understanding and generation, enhancing Human-Computer
Interaction (HCI). However, LLMs are limited to unimodal text processing and
lack the ability to interpret emotional cues from non-verbal signals, hindering
more immersive and empathetic interactions. This work explores integrating
multimodal sentiment perception into LLMs to create emotion-aware agents. We
propose \ours, an AI-based virtual companion that captures multimodal sentiment
cues, enabling emotionally aligned and animated HCI. \ours introduces a
Multimodal Sentiment Perception Network (MSPN) using a cross-modal fusion
transformer and supervised contrastive learning to provide emotional cues.
Additionally, we develop an emotion-aware prompt engineering strategy for
generating empathetic responses and integrate a Text-to-Speech (TTS) system and
animated avatar module for expressive interactions. \ours provides a framework
for emotion-aware agents with applications in companion robotics, social care,
mental health, and human-centered AI.

Motivation: fMRI在临床诊断中面临信噪比低、个体差异大、现有模型频率感知有限以及缺乏文本标注等问题，需要新的方法来提升脑疾病诊断的可靠性。

Method: 框架包含三个组件：1) ROI驱动的fMRI文本生成，将激活、连接性等特征转化为可复现的文本标记；2) 混合频率-空间编码器，结合小波-mamba分支和跨尺度Transformer编码器；3) 自适应语义对齐模块，在共享空间中嵌入文本和视觉特征。

Conclusion: RTGMFF通过融合文本生成和多模态特征，有效解决了fMRI脑疾病诊断中的关键挑战，为临床诊断提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is a powerful tool for probing
brain function, yet reliable clinical diagnosis is hampered by low
signal-to-noise ratios, inter-subject variability, and the limited frequency
awareness of prevailing CNN- and Transformer-based models. Moreover, most fMRI
datasets lack textual annotations that could contextualize regional activation
and connectivity patterns. We introduce RTGMFF, a framework that unifies
automatic ROI-level text generation with multimodal feature fusion for
brain-disorder diagnosis. RTGMFF consists of three components: (i) ROI-driven
fMRI text generation deterministically condenses each subject's activation,
connectivity, age, and sex into reproducible text tokens; (ii) Hybrid
frequency-spatial encoder fuses a hierarchical wavelet-mamba branch with a
cross-scale Transformer encoder to capture frequency-domain structure alongside
long-range spatial dependencies; and (iii) Adaptive semantic alignment module
embeds the ROI token sequence and visual features in a shared space, using a
regularized cosine-similarity loss to narrow the modality gap. Extensive
experiments on the ADHD-200 and ABIDE benchmarks show that RTGMFF surpasses
current methods in diagnostic accuracy, achieving notable gains in sensitivity,
specificity, and area under the ROC curve. Code is available at

Abstract: Organoids replicate organ structure and function, playing a crucial role in
fields such as tumor treatment and drug screening. Their shape and size can

accurately segmenting, tracking, and quantifying organoids. The model leverages
complementary information extracted from CNN and Transformer modules and
introduces the innovative feature fusion module, Learnable Gaussian Band Pass

Abstract: Synthetic tumors in medical images offer controllable characteristics that
facilitate the training of machine learning models, leading to an improved
segmentation performance. However, the existing methods of tumor synthesis
yield suboptimal performances when tumor occupies a large spatial volume, such
as breast tumor segmentation in MRI with a large field-of-view (FOV), while
commonly used tumor generation methods are based on small patches. In this
paper, we propose a 3D medical diffusion model, called SynBT, to generate
high-quality breast tumor (BT) in contrast-enhanced MRI images. The proposed
model consists of a patch-to-volume autoencoder, which is able to compress the
high-resolution MRIs into compact latent space, while preserving the resolution
of volumes with large FOV. Using the obtained latent space feature vector, a
mask-conditioned diffusion model is used to synthesize breast tumors within
selected regions of breast tissue, resulting in realistic tumor appearances. We
evaluated the proposed method for a tumor segmentation task, which demonstrated
the proposed high-quality tumor synthesis method can facilitate the common
segmentation models with performance improvement of 2-3% Dice Score on a large
public dataset, and therefore provides benefits for tumor segmentation in MRI

*Qihang Zhou,Shibo He,Jiangtao Yan,Wenchao Meng,Jiming Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 通过结合点云和像素信息，将CLIP的2D异常检测能力转移到3D领域，提出PointAD+框架实现了对未见对象的全面3D异常检测和分割。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将CLIP在2D图像上的强大异常检测能力扩展到3D领域，解决在高度多样化类别语义的未见对象上进行3D异常检测的挑战。

Method: 首先设计PointAD模型，利用点-像素对应关系通过渲染像素表示3D异常（隐式表示）。然后提出PointAD+，通过G-aggregation涵盖几何信息实现空间意识表示（显式表示）。采用层次表示学习，结合渲染层和几何层的文本提示，通过跨层次对比对齐促进层间交互。

Result: 大量实验证明PointAD+在未见对象的零样本3D异常检测中表现优异，能够实现对异常的全面理解。

Conclusion: PointAD+通过结合隐式和显式3D表示方式，成功将CLIP的2D异常检测能力转移到3D领域，为高度多样化类别的未见对象提供了精准的3D异常检测方案。

Abstract: In this paper, we aim to transfer CLIP's robust 2D generalization
capabilities to identify 3D anomalies across unseen objects of highly diverse
class semantics. To this end, we propose a unified framework to comprehensively
detect and segment 3D anomalies by leveraging both point- and pixel-level
information. We first design PointAD, which leverages point-pixel
correspondence to represent 3D anomalies through their associated rendering
pixel representations. This approach is referred to as implicit 3D
representation, as it focuses solely on rendering pixel anomalies but neglects
the inherent spatial relationships within point clouds. Then, we propose
PointAD+ to further broaden the interpretation of 3D anomalies by introducing
explicit 3D representation, emphasizing spatial abnormality to uncover abnormal
spatial relationships. Hence, we propose G-aggregation to involve geometry
information to enable the aggregated point representations spatially aware. To
simultaneously capture rendering and spatial abnormality, PointAD+ proposes
hierarchical representation learning, incorporating implicit and explicit
anomaly semantics into hierarchical text prompts: rendering prompts for the
rendering layer and geometry prompts for the geometry layer. A cross-hierarchy
contrastive alignment is further introduced to promote the interaction between
the rendering and geometry layers, facilitating mutual anomaly learning.
Finally, PointAD+ integrates anomaly semantics from both layers to capture the
generalized anomaly semantics. During the test, PointAD+ can integrate RGB
information in a plug-and-play manner and further improve its detection
performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of PointAD+ in
ZS 3D anomaly detection across unseen objects with highly diverse class
semantics, achieving a holistic understanding of abnormality.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索验证奖励强化学习在参数少于70亿的轻量级多模态语言模型中的有效性，研究长链式思维数据对这些模型推理能力的提升作用

Method: 使用长链式思维数据进行监督微调，随后进行强化学习阶段来进一步提升模型性能

Result: 长链式思维数据的监督微调显著提升了MLLM的推理能力，后续的强化学习阶段还能带来额外的性能增益

Conclusion: 使用长链式思维数据进行监督微调是开发轻量级多模态语言模型推理能力的关键前提条件

Abstract: While Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards has enhanced the
reasoning of large-scale language models (LLMs), its efficacy for lightweight
multimodal language models (MLLMs) with fewer than seven billion parameters
remains underexplored. This paper investigates the role of long
Chain-of-Thought (long CoT) data in enhancing the reasoning abilities of such
MLLMs. Our findings demonstrate that Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) with long CoT
data significantly improves MLLM reasoning. Furthermore, we observe that after
this initial SFT phase, MLLMs can achieve additional performance gains through
a subsequent RL stage. We conclude that a SFT stage with long CoT data is a
critical prerequisite for developing the reasoning capabilities of lightweight
MLLMs.

Conclusion: 混合CNN-Transformer架构在星形胶质细胞检测方面具有强大潜力，为先进的计算病理学工具奠定了基础。

Abstract: Astrocytes are critical glial cells whose altered morphology and density are
hallmarks of many neurological disorders. However, their intricate branching
and stain dependent variability make automated detection of histological images
a highly challenging task. To address these challenges, we propose a hybrid CNN
Transformer detector that combines local feature extraction with global
contextual reasoning. A heatmap guided query mechanism generates spatially
grounded anchors for small and faint astrocytes, while a lightweight
Transformer module improves discrimination in dense clusters. Evaluated on
ALDH1L1 and GFAP stained astrocyte datasets, the model consistently
outperformed Faster R-CNN, YOLOv11 and DETR, achieving higher sensitivity with
fewer false positives, as confirmed by FROC analysis. These results highlight
the potential of hybrid CNN Transformer architectures for robust astrocyte
detection and provide a foundation for advanced computational pathology tools.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: InfraDiffusion是一个零样本框架，通过虚拟相机将砖石点云转换为深度图，并使用DDNM进行恢复，无需特定任务训练即可提升深度图的视觉清晰度和几何一致性，显著改善了砖块级分割效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在低光照环境（如砖石隧道）中获取高分辨率RGB图像不切实际，而点云虽然对昏暗光照鲁棒，但通常是非结构化、稀疏且嘈杂的，限制了细粒度分割。需要一种方法能够利用点云数据进行精细的砖块级缺陷检测。

Method: 提出InfraDiffusion框架：1）使用虚拟相机将砖石点云投影为深度图；2）采用去噪扩散零空间模型（DDNM）恢复深度图；3）无需特定任务训练即可增强深度图的视觉清晰度和几何一致性；4）使用Segment Anything Model（SAM）进行砖块级分割。

Result: 在砖石桥梁和隧道点云数据集上的实验表明，该方法在砖块级分割方面取得了显著改进，证明了其在砖石资产自动化检测中的潜力。

Conclusion: InfraDiffusion通过将点云转换为深度图并利用扩散模型进行恢复，有效解决了低光照环境下细粒度分割的挑战，为零样本砖石结构缺陷检测提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Point clouds are widely used for infrastructure monitoring by providing
geometric information, where segmentation is required for downstream tasks such
as defect detection. Existing research has automated semantic segmentation of
structural components, while brick-level segmentation (identifying defects such
as spalling and mortar loss) has been primarily conducted from RGB images.
However, acquiring high-resolution images is impractical in low-light
environments like masonry tunnels. Point clouds, though robust to dim lighting,
are typically unstructured, sparse, and noisy, limiting fine-grained
segmentation. We present InfraDiffusion, a zero-shot framework that projects
masonry point clouds into depth maps using virtual cameras and restores them by
adapting the Denoising Diffusion Null-space Model (DDNM). Without task-specific
training, InfraDiffusion enhances visual clarity and geometric consistency of
depth maps. Experiments on masonry bridge and tunnel point cloud datasets show
significant improvements in brick-level segmentation using the Segment Anything
Model (SAM), underscoring its potential for automated inspection of masonry
assets. Our code and data is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习方法在高光谱解混中难以同时表征全局依赖和局部一致性，导致无法同时保持长程交互和边界细节

Method: 使用Transformer捕获全局依赖，引入内容自适应图神经网络增强局部关系，整合多传播阶次动态学习图结构，采用图残差机制保持全局信息和稳定训练

Result: 实验结果表明该方法优于最先进的方法

Conclusion: T-CAGU框架通过Transformer和图神经网络的结合，有效解决了高光谱解混中全局与局部特征平衡的挑战，具有鲁棒性和优越性能

Abstract: Hyperspectral unmixing (HU) targets to decompose each mixed pixel in remote
sensing images into a set of endmembers and their corresponding abundances.
Despite significant progress in this field using deep learning, most methods
fail to simultaneously characterize global dependencies and local consistency,
making it difficult to preserve both long-range interactions and boundary
details. This letter proposes a novel transformer-guided content-adaptive graph
unmixing framework (T-CAGU), which overcomes these challenges by employing a
transformer to capture global dependencies and introducing a content-adaptive
graph neural network to enhance local relationships. Unlike previous work,
T-CAGU integrates multiple propagation orders to dynamically learn the graph
structure, ensuring robustness against noise. Furthermore, T-CAGU leverages a
graph residual mechanism to preserve global information and stabilize training.
Experimental results demonstrate its superiority over the state-of-the-art
methods. Our code is available at https://github.com/xianchaoxiu/T-CAGU.

Motivation: Vision Transformers在图像分类中表现优异但计算成本高昂，需要在不牺牲精度的情况下降低大ViT模型的推理成本

Method: 使用轻量级视觉模型在推理时估计token重要性，选择性丢弃低重要性token，无需修改架构且兼容各种ViT模型

Result: 在标准图像分类基准测试中，FLOPs减少高达80%，精度下降极小

Conclusion: 该框架具有出色的泛化能力和实际应用价值，为高效ViT分类提供了实用解决方案

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) achieve strong performance in image classification
but incur high computational costs from processing all image tokens. To reduce
inference costs in large ViTs without compromising accuracy, we propose
TinyDrop, a training-free token dropping framework guided by a lightweight
vision model. The guidance model estimates the importance of tokens while
performing inference, thereby selectively discarding low-importance tokens if
large vit models need to perform attention calculations. The framework operates
plug-and-play, requires no architectural modifications, and is compatible with
diverse ViT architectures. Evaluations on standard image classification
benchmarks demonstrate that our framework reduces FLOPs by up to 80% for ViTs
with minimal accuracy degradation, highlighting its generalization capability
and practical utility for efficient ViT-based classification.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有评估指标在概念定制任务中要么过于狭窄要么过于泛化，与人类偏好存在偏差，特别是在多概念评估中难以准确评估概念间的交互关系

Method: 提出分解式GPT评分(D-GPTScore)，将评估标准分解为更细粒度的方面，并使用多模态大语言模型(MLLM)进行方面级评估；同时发布了包含单概念和多概念任务的CC-AlignBench基准数据集

Result: 在CC-AlignBench基准上显著优于现有方法，展现出与人类偏好更高的相关性

Conclusion: 为概念定制评估建立了新标准，并指出了未来研究的关键挑战

Abstract: Evaluating concept customization is challenging, as it requires a
comprehensive assessment of fidelity to generative prompts and concept images.
Moreover, evaluating multiple concepts is considerably more difficult than
evaluating a single concept, as it demands detailed assessment not only for
each individual concept but also for the interactions among concepts. While
humans can intuitively assess generated images, existing metrics often provide
either overly narrow or overly generalized evaluations, resulting in
misalignment with human preference. To address this, we propose Decomposed GPT
Score (D-GPTScore), a novel human-aligned evaluation method that decomposes
evaluation criteria into finer aspects and incorporates aspect-wise assessments
using Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM). Additionally, we release Human
Preference-Aligned Concept Customization Benchmark (CC-AlignBench), a benchmark
dataset containing both single- and multi-concept tasks, enabling stage-wise
evaluation across a wide difficulty range -- from individual actions to
multi-person interactions. Our method significantly outperforms existing
approaches on this benchmark, exhibiting higher correlation with human
preferences. This work establishes a new standard for evaluating concept
customization and highlights key challenges for future research. The benchmark

Conclusion: 该研究提出的可扩展多模态框架和双重WSI表征方法为乳腾癌分子分型带来了显著改进，同时具有良好的通用性，能够应用于其他癌症类型的分析。

Abstract: Healthcare applications are inherently multimodal, benefiting greatly from
the integration of diverse data sources. However, the modalities available in
clinical settings can vary across different locations and patients. A key area
that stands to gain from multimodal integration is breast cancer molecular
subtyping, an important clinical task that can facilitate personalized
treatment and improve patient prognosis. In this work, we propose a scalable
and loosely-coupled multimodal framework that seamlessly integrates data from
various modalities, including copy number variation (CNV), clinical records,
and histopathology images, to enhance breast cancer subtyping. While our
primary focus is on breast cancer, our framework is designed to easily
accommodate additional modalities, offering the flexibility to scale up or down
with minimal overhead without requiring re-training of existing modalities,
making it applicable to other types of cancers as well. We introduce a
dual-based representation for whole slide images (WSIs), combining traditional
image-based and graph-based WSI representations. This novel dual approach
results in significant performance improvements. Moreover, we present a new
multimodal fusion strategy, demonstrating its ability to enhance performance
across a range of multimodal conditions. Our comprehensive results show that
integrating our dual-based WSI representation with CNV and clinical health
records, along with our pipeline and fusion strategy, outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in breast cancer subtyping.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有密集视频描述方法在处理长视频时遇到计算复杂性和内存限制问题，且需要整个视频作为输入才能输出结果，无法支持在线处理。

Method: 提出具有转移状态的状态空间模型(SSM)，结合SSM的长序列和递归特性，解决SSM在很长上下文中无法维持状态的主要限制。

Result: 方法在密集视频描述中能够良好地适应不同视频长度，使用计算量减少7倍(FLOPs)，支持在线流式处理。

Conclusion: 该方法通过时间缩放SSM模型，有效解决了长视频处理的挑战，实现了高效的密集视频描述和在线处理能力。

Abstract: Dense video captioning is a challenging video understanding task which aims
to simultaneously segment the video into a sequence of meaningful consecutive
events and to generate detailed captions to accurately describe each event.
Existing methods often encounter difficulties when working with the long videos
associated with dense video captioning, due to the computational complexity and
memory limitations. Furthermore, traditional approaches require the entire
video as input, in order to produce an answer, which precludes online
processing of the video. We address these challenges by time-scaling
State-Space Models (SSMs) to even longer sequences than before. Our approach,
State-Space Models with Transfer State, combines both the long-sequence and
recurrent properties of SSMs and addresses the main limitation of SSMs which
are otherwise not able to sustain their state for very long contexts,
effectively scaling SSMs further in time. The proposed model is particularly
suitable for generating captions on-the-fly, in an online or streaming manner,
without having to wait for the full video to be processed, which is more
beneficial in practice. When applied to dense video captioning, our approach
scales well with video lengths and uses 7x fewer FLOPs.

Motivation: 解决从低信器比EEG信号中解码视觉神经表征的挑战，通过引入文本模态来增强EEG信号与视觉内容之间的语义对应关系

Method: 提出了一个多模态对齐框架，包括：1)使用文本提供显式语义标签；2)插件模块利用预训练表征；3)MCDB策略动态调整模态负载；4)SPR正则化项提高模型演化能力

Result: 在ThingsEEG数据集上，Top-1和Top-5准确率分别提升2.0%和4.7%，超越了之前的最优方法

Conclusion: 通过多模态数据融合和创新的对齐机制，该方法能够有效地从噪声中提取语乙信息，为神经信号解码领域提供了新的研究方向

Abstract: In this work, we propose an innovative framework that integrates EEG, image,
and text data, aiming to decode visual neural representations from low
signal-to-noise ratio EEG signals. Specifically, we introduce text modality to
enhance the semantic correspondence between EEG signals and visual content.
With the explicit semantic labels provided by text, image and EEG features of
the same category can be more closely aligned with the corresponding text
representations in a shared multimodal space. To fully utilize pre-trained
visual and textual representations, we propose an adapter module that
alleviates the instability of high-dimensional representation while
facilitating the alignment and fusion of cross-modal features. Additionally, to
alleviate the imbalance in multimodal feature contributions introduced by the
textual representations, we propose a Modal Consistency Dynamic Balance (MCDB)
strategy that dynamically adjusts the contribution weights of each modality. We
further propose a stochastic perturbation regularization (SPR) term to enhance
the generalization ability of semantic perturbation-based models by introducing
dynamic Gaussian noise in the modality optimization process. The evaluation
results on the ThingsEEG dataset show that our method surpasses previous
state-of-the-art methods in both Top-1 and Top-5 accuracy metrics, improving by
2.0\% and 4.7\% respectively.

Motivation: 道路缺陷检测对减少车辆损坏很重要，但现有方法通常需要集成或测试时增强，不适合内存和计算资源有限的边缘设备

Method: 设计双判别器的生成模型，使用CLIP-based FID损失提升合成图像质量，生成器和检测器联合训练以生成更难样本进行数据增强

Result: 在RDD2022基准测试中超越现有方法，参数量减少80%以上，更适合边缘设备部署

Conclusion: JTGD方法在不使用集成和TTA的情况下实现了优异的道路缺陷检测性能，具有实际部署价值

Abstract: Road defect detection is important for road authorities to reduce the vehicle
damage caused by road defects. Considering the practical scenarios where the
defect detectors are typically deployed on edge devices with limited memory and
computational resource, we aim at performing road defect detection without
using ensemble-based methods or test-time augmentation (TTA). To this end, we
propose to Jointly Train the image Generator and Detector for road defect
detection (dubbed as JTGD). We design the dual discriminators for the
generative model to enforce both the synthesized defect patches and overall
images to look plausible. The synthesized image quality is improved by our
proposed CLIP-based Fr\'echet Inception Distance loss. The generative model in
JTGD is trained jointly with the detector to encourage the generative model to
synthesize harder examples for the detector. Since harder synthesized images of
better quality caused by the aforesaid design are used in the data
augmentation, JTGD outperforms the state-of-the-art method in the RDD2022 road
defect detection benchmark across various countries under the condition of no
ensemble and TTA. JTGD only uses less than 20% of the number of parameters
compared with the competing baseline, which makes it more suitable for
deployment on edge devices in practice.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel parameter-efficient adaptation method for
No- Reference Image Quality Assessment (NR-IQA) using visual prompts optimized
in pixel-space. Unlike full fine-tuning of Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs), our approach trains only 600K parameters at most (< 0.01% of the base
model), while keeping the underlying model fully frozen. During inference,
these visual prompts are combined with images via addition and processed by
mPLUG-Owl2 with the textual query "Rate the technical quality of the image."
Evaluations across distortion types (synthetic, realistic, AI-generated) on
KADID- 10k, KonIQ-10k, and AGIQA-3k demonstrate competitive performance against
full finetuned methods and specialized NR-IQA models, achieving 0.93 SRCC on
KADID-10k. To our knowledge, this is the first work to leverage pixel-space
visual prompts for NR-IQA, enabling efficient MLLM adaptation for low-level

Motivation: 现有统一多模态模型通常需要外部视觉组件（如ViT或视觉分词器），导致推理效率低下，特别是处理高分辨率输入时。需要一种更简洁高效的架构来实现真正的统一多模态智能。

Method: 提出纯解码器Transformer架构，使用模态特定的MoE结构，采用单一自回归目标训练，支持动态分辨率。在LLM中引入多尺度视觉自回归机制，大幅减少解码步骤。

Result: 在多项基准测试中超越了现有开源统一多模态模型，在多模态生成、编辑和理解任务上均达到最先进性能，同时显著提升了推理效率。

Conclusion: 纯自回归建模可以作为统一多模态智能的充分且优雅的基础，OneCAT为这一方向设立了新的性能标准，展示了强大的潜力。

Abstract: We introduce OneCAT, a unified multimodal model that seamlessly integrates
understanding, generation, and editing within a novel, pure decoder-only
transformer architecture. Our framework uniquely eliminates the need for
external components such as Vision Transformers (ViT) or vision tokenizer
during inference, leading to significant efficiency gains, especially for
high-resolution inputs. This is achieved through a modality-specific
Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) structure trained with a single autoregressive (AR)
objective, which also natively supports dynamic resolutions. Furthermore, we
pioneer a multi-scale visual autoregressive mechanism within the Large Language
Model (LLM) that drastically reduces decoding steps compared to diffusion-based
methods while maintaining state-of-the-art performance. Our findings
demonstrate the powerful potential of pure autoregressive modeling as a
sufficient and elegant foundation for unified multimodal intelligence. As a
result, OneCAT sets a new performance standard, outperforming existing
open-source unified multimodal models across benchmarks for multimodal
generation, editing, and understanding.

Abstract: Benchmarking multi-object tracking and object detection model performance is
an essential step in machine learning model development, as it allows
researchers to evaluate model detection and tracker performance on
human-generated 'test' data, facilitating consistent comparisons between models
and trackers and aiding performance optimization. In this study, a novel
benchmark video dataset was developed and used to assess the performance of
several Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute object detection models and a
FathomNet single-class object detection model together with several trackers.
The dataset consists of four video sequences representing midwater and benthic
deep-sea habitats. Performance was evaluated using Higher Order Tracking
Accuracy, a metric that balances detection, localization, and association
accuracy. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first publicly available
benchmark for multi-object tracking in deep-sea video footage. We provide the
benchmark data, a clearly documented workflow for generating additional
benchmark videos, as well as example Python notebooks for computing metrics.

Existing Video Large Language Models (Video LLMs), while capable of
coarse-level comprehension, struggle with fine-grained, spatiotemporal
reasoning, especially when user queries rely on time-based event references for
temporal anchoring, or gestural cues for spatial anchoring to clarify object
references and positions. To bridge this critical gap, we introduce Strefer, a
synthetic instruction data generation framework designed to equip Video LLMs
with spatiotemporal referring and reasoning capabilities. Strefer produces
diverse instruction-tuning data using a data engine that pseudo-annotates
temporally dense, fine-grained video metadata, capturing rich spatial and
temporal information in a structured manner, including subjects, objects, their
locations as masklets, and their action descriptions and timelines. Our
approach enhances the ability of Video LLMs to interpret spatial and temporal
references, fostering more versatile, space-time-aware reasoning essential for
real-world AI companions. Without using proprietary models, costly human
annotation, or the need to annotate large volumes of new videos, experimental
evaluations show that models trained with data produced by Strefer outperform
baselines on tasks requiring spatial and temporal disambiguation. Additionally,
these models exhibit enhanced space-time-aware reasoning, establishing a new
foundation for perceptually grounded, instruction-tuned Video LLMs.

Motivation: 目前缺乏用于研究手写遗传特性的综合性数据库，需要创建一个包含多代家庭成员手写样本的数据集来回答手写是否存在遗传因素等问题。

Method: 收集210个家庭的手写样本，包括祖父母、父母、叔伯、姨妈、兄弟委妹、堂兄弟委妹、姑侄等。样本包含数字、字母、形状和自由段落。通过特殊设计的表格收集并记录家庭关系。

Result: 通过对家庭成员手写特征的比较和研究，发现了他们之间的相似性和写作风格。这个数据库是目前为止唯一的类似数据集。

Conclusion: 该数据库已公开提供给模式识别社区，并希望能为手写遗传效应和家庭关系影响的研究开启新的路径。

Abstract: This paper introduces a comprehensive database for research and investigation
on the effects of inheritance on handwriting. A database has been created that
can be used to answer questions such as: Is there a genetic component to
handwriting? Is handwriting inherited? Do family relationships affect
handwriting? Varieties of samples of handwritten components such as: digits,
letters, shapes and free paragraphs of 210 families including (grandparents,
parents, uncles, aunts, siblings, cousins, nephews and nieces) have been
collected using specially designed forms, and family relationships of all
writers are captured. To the best of our knowledge, no such database is
presently available. Based on comparisons and investigation of features of
handwritings of family members, similarities among their features and writing
styles are detected. Our database is freely available to the pattern
recognition community and hope it will pave the way for investigations on the
effects of inheritance and family relationships on handwritings.

Motivation: 现有文本到图像生成基准测试在评估组合和推理能力方面存在局限性，无法全面评估模型的核心能力，且当前基准测试的场景密度低、推理简单

Method: 构建包含12维评估分类法的基准测试，围绕场景图元素（实例、属性、关系）构建组合能力评估，围绕哲学推理框架（演绎、归纳、溯因）构建推理能力评估，每个提示都配有检查清单进行细粒度评估

Result: 在27个当前T2I模型上的实验显示，模型在复杂高密度场景中的组合能力仍然有限，推理能力更是严重瓶颈，所有模型都难以从提示中推断隐含元素

Conclusion: T2I-CoReBench提供了一个全面复杂的基准测试，揭示了当前T2I模型在组合和推理能力方面的局限性，特别是推理能力需要显著改进

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) generation aims to synthesize images from textual
prompts, which jointly specify what must be shown and imply what can be
inferred, thereby corresponding to two core capabilities: composition and
reasoning. However, with the emerging advances of T2I models in reasoning
beyond composition, existing benchmarks reveal clear limitations in providing
comprehensive evaluations across and within these capabilities. Meanwhile,
these advances also enable models to handle more complex prompts, whereas
current benchmarks remain limited to low scene density and simplified
one-to-one reasoning. To address these limitations, we propose T2I-CoReBench, a
comprehensive and complex benchmark that evaluates both composition and
reasoning capabilities of T2I models. To ensure comprehensiveness, we structure
composition around scene graph elements (instance, attribute, and relation) and
reasoning around the philosophical framework of inference (deductive,
inductive, and abductive), formulating a 12-dimensional evaluation taxonomy. To
increase complexity, driven by the inherent complexities of real-world
scenarios, we curate each prompt with high compositional density for
composition and multi-step inference for reasoning. We also pair each prompt
with a checklist that specifies individual yes/no questions to assess each
intended element independently to facilitate fine-grained and reliable
evaluation. In statistics, our benchmark comprises 1,080 challenging prompts
and around 13,500 checklist questions. Experiments across 27 current T2I models
reveal that their composition capability still remains limited in complex
high-density scenarios, while the reasoning capability lags even further behind
as a critical bottleneck, with all models struggling to infer implicit elements
from prompts. Our project page: https://t2i-corebench.github.io/.

TL;DR: 通过结合标签数据和未标签数据的表征，使用排名融合和z-score标准化技术来提升RAG系统的检索效果和领域外演续性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用标签数据(输入-输出关联)和未标签数据(更广泛的上下文基础)可以为检索增强生成(RAG)带来互补性好处，但如何有效结合来自这些异构来源的证据是一个挑战。

Method: 首先使用标准排名融合技术对每个来源(标签和未标签)的多个IR模型进行顶部文档聚合，然后通过z-score变换标准化各来源内部的检索分数分布，最后合并两个来源的顶部检索文档。

Result: 在事实验证任务上评估，该方法一贯地超过了最佳单独排名器或单一来源的性能，并显示出更好的领域外演续性。

Conclusion: 通过标准化异构来源的检索分数分布并融合多个排名器的信念，可以有效提升RAG系统的检索效果和演续性。

Abstract: Leveraging both labeled (input-output associations) and unlabeled data (wider
contextual grounding) may provide complementary benefits in retrieval augmented
generation (RAG). However, effectively combining evidence from these
heterogeneous sources is challenging as the respective similarity scores are
not inter-comparable. Additionally, aggregating beliefs from the outputs of
multiple rankers can improve the effectiveness of RAG. Our proposed method
first aggregates the top-documents from a number of IR models using a standard
rank fusion technique for each source (labeled and unlabeled). Next, we
standardize the retrieval score distributions within each source by applying
z-score transformation before merging the top-retrieved documents from the two
sources. We evaluate our approach on the fact verification task, demonstrating
that it consistently improves over the best-performing individual ranker or
source and also shows better out-of-domain generalization.

Result: 线上A/B测试显示：LLM检索提升添加购物车率36%，车上下文排名器提升NDCG@4 27%。

Conclusion: 该框架为跨类利用推荐提供了有效的实践技术，对电子商务系统具有广泛意义。

Abstract: Modern e-commerce platforms strive to enhance customer experience by
providing timely and contextually relevant recommendations. However,
recommending general merchandise to customers focused on grocery shopping --
such as pairing milk with a milk frother -- remains a critical yet
under-explored challenge. This paper introduces a cross-pollination (XP)
framework, a novel approach that bridges grocery and general merchandise
cross-category recommendations by leveraging multi-source product associations
and real-time cart context. Our solution employs a two-stage framework: (1) A
candidate generation mechanism that uses co-purchase market basket analysis and
LLM-based approach to identify novel item-item associations; and (2) a
transformer-based ranker that leverages the real-time sequential cart context
and optimizes for engagement signals such as add-to-carts. Offline analysis and
online A/B tests show an increase of 36\% add-to-cart rate with LLM-based
retrieval, and 27\% NDCG\@4 lift using cart context-based ranker. Our work
contributes practical techniques for cross-category recommendations and broader
insights for e-commerce systems.

Abstract: Cross-domain recommendation systems face the challenge of integrating
fine-grained user and item relationships across various product domains. To
address this, we introduce RankGraph, a scalable graph learning framework
designed to serve as a core component in recommendation foundation models
(FMs). By constructing and leveraging graphs composed of heterogeneous nodes
and edges across multiple products, RankGraph enables the integration of
complex relationships between users, posts, ads, and other entities. Our
framework employs a GPU-accelerated Graph Neural Network and contrastive
learning, allowing for dynamic extraction of subgraphs such as item-item and
user-user graphs to support similarity-based retrieval and real-time
clustering. Furthermore, RankGraph integrates graph-based pretrained
representations as contextual tokens into FM sequence models, enriching them
with structured relational knowledge. RankGraph has demonstrated improvements
in click (+0.92%) and conversion rates (+2.82%) in online A/B tests, showcasing
its effectiveness in cross-domain recommendation scenarios.

Abstract: In the contemporary age characterized by information abundance, rapid
advancements in artificial intelligence have rendered recommendation systems
indispensable. Conventional recommendation methodologies based on collaborative
filtering or individual attributes encounter deficiencies in capturing nuanced
user interests. Knowledge graphs and multimodal data integration offer enhanced
representations of users and items with greater richness and precision. This
paper reviews existing multimodal knowledge graph recommendation frameworks,
identifying shortcomings in modal interaction and higher-order dependency
modeling. We propose the Cross-Graph Cross-Modal Mutual Information-Driven
Unified Knowledge Graph Learning and Recommendation Framework
(CrossGMMI-DUKGLR), which employs pre-trained visual-text alignment models for
feature extraction, achieves fine-grained modality fusion through multi-head
cross-attention, and propagates higher-order adjacency information via graph
attention networks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多媒体推荐系统通过评估相似性来推荐媒体内容，但缺乏对嵌入代表性和价值的系统考虑，导致嵌入的实用性和可解释性大幅下降。

Method: 提出基于概率的嵌入优化方法，使用基于负2-Wasserstein距离的对比损失来增强嵌入代表性；引入基于多变量Shapley值的重新加权策略来评估交互和嵌入的价值。

Result: 在多个骨干推荐器和真实数据集上的广泛实验表明，RVRec能够显著提升现有推荐器的个性化和可解释性，优于最先进的基线方法。

Conclusion: RVRec作为一种模型无关的嵌入增强方法，通过系统考虑嵌入的代表性和价值，有效解决了现有推荐系统在实用性和可解释性方面的局限性。

Abstract: Existing multimedia recommender systems provide users with suggestions of
media by evaluating the similarities, such as games and movies. To enhance the
semantics and explainability of embeddings, it is a consensus to apply
additional information (e.g., interactions, contexts, popularity). However,
without systematic consideration of representativeness and value, the utility
and explainability of embedding drops drastically. Hence, we introduce RVRec, a
plug-and-play model-agnostic embedding enhancement approach that can improve
both personality and explainability of existing systems. Specifically, we
propose a probability-based embedding optimization method that uses a
contrastive loss based on negative 2-Wasserstein distance to learn to enhance
the representativeness of the embeddings. In addtion, we introduce a reweighing
method based on multivariate Shapley values strategy to evaluate and explore
the value of interactions and embeddings. Extensive experiments on multiple
backbone recommenders and real-world datasets show that RVRec can improve the
personalization and explainability of existing recommenders, outperforming
state-of-the-art baselines.

Method: 提出RecBase模型，使用大规模异构跨域语料库，采用统一文本表示和特征映射；引入统一项目分词器将项目编码为层次化概念标识符，实现结构化表示和词汇表共享；使用自回归目标训练以捕捉复杂项目级序列模式

Result: 在8个真实世界数据集上，1.5B参数的RecBase模型在零样本和跨域推荐任务中达到或超越了7B参数LLM基线的性能

Conclusion: RecBase通过推荐导向的预训练和跨域语义对齐机制，有效解决了LLM在推荐任务中的跨域泛化问题，为构建领域无关的推荐基础模型提供了有效方案

Abstract: Recent advances in LLM-based recommendation have shown promise, yet their
cross-domain generalization is hindered by a fundamental mismatch between
language-centric pretraining and the recommendation task. Existing methods,
relying on language-level knowledge, fail to capture dynamic, item-level user
interests across domains. To bridge this gap, we propose RecBase, a
domain-agnostic foundational model pretrained with a recommendation-oriented
objective. RecBase leverages a large-scale, heterogeneous, cross-domain corpus
with unified textual representations and feature mappings to enhance
cross-domain generalization. To further align item semantics across domains, we
introduce a unified item tokenizer that encodes items into hierarchical concept
identifiers, enabling structured representation and efficient vocabulary
sharing. The model is trained using an autoregressive objective to capture
complex item-level sequential patterns. On eight real-world datasets, our
1.5B-parameter model matches or surpasses the performance of LLM baselines up
to 7B parameters in zero-shot and cross-domain recommendation tasks.

Abstract: We propose a general model-agnostic Contrastive learning framework with
Counterfactual Samples Synthesizing (CCSS) for modeling the monotonicity
between the neural network output and numerical features which is critical for
interpretability and effectiveness of recommender systems. CCSS models the
monotonicity via a two-stage process: synthesizing counterfactual samples and
contrasting the counterfactual samples. The two techniques are naturally
integrated into a model-agnostic framework, forming an end-to-end training
process. Abundant empirical tests are conducted on a publicly available dataset
and a real industrial dataset, and the results well demonstrate the
effectiveness of our proposed CCSS. Besides, CCSS has been deployed in our real
large-scale industrial recommender, successfully serving over hundreds of
millions users.

Motivation: 传统电商搜索系统采用多级级联架构，虽然能在计算效率和商业转化之间取得平衡，但存在碎片化计算和各阶段优化目标冲突的问题，限制了性能上限。

Method: 提出OneSearch框架，包含三个关键创新：1）关键词增强的分层量化编码模块（KHQE）保持分层语义和独特商品属性；2）多视图用户行为序列注入策略，构建行为驱动的用户ID并整合显式短期和隐式长期序列；3）偏好感知奖励系统（PARS），采用多阶段监督微调和自适应奖励加权排序。

Conclusion: OneSearch成功解决了传统电商搜索系统的局限性，通过端到端生成式框架实现了显著的性能提升和成本优化，已在快手多个搜索场景部署，服务数百万用户，每日产生数千万页面浏览量。

Abstract: Traditional e-commerce search systems employ multi-stage cascading
architectures (MCA) that progressively filter items through recall,
pre-ranking, and ranking stages. While effective at balancing computational
efficiency with business conversion, these systems suffer from fragmented
computation and optimization objective collisions across stages, which
ultimately limit their performance ceiling. To address these, we propose
\textbf{OneSearch}, the first industrial-deployed end-to-end generative
framework for e-commerce search. This framework introduces three key
innovations: (1) a Keyword-enhanced Hierarchical Quantization Encoding (KHQE)
module, to preserve both hierarchical semantics and distinctive item attributes
while maintaining strong query-item relevance constraints; (2) a multi-view
user behavior sequence injection strategy that constructs behavior-driven user
IDs and incorporates both explicit short-term and implicit long-term sequences
to model user preferences comprehensively; and (3) a Preference-Aware Reward
System (PARS) featuring multi-stage supervised fine-tuning and adaptive
reward-weighted ranking to capture fine-grained user preferences. Extensive
offline evaluations on large-scale industry datasets demonstrate OneSearch's
superior performance for high-quality recall and ranking. The rigorous online
A/B tests confirm its ability to enhance relevance in the same exposure
position, achieving statistically significant improvements: +1.67\% item CTR,
+2.40\% buyer, and +3.22\% order volume. Furthermore, OneSearch reduces
operational expenditure by 75.40\% and improves Model FLOPs Utilization from
3.26\% to 27.32\%. The system has been successfully deployed across multiple
search scenarios in Kuaishou, serving millions of users, generating tens of
millions of PVs daily.

Motivation: 研究媒体报道是否能够促进AI创造者生产安全产品，以实现AI技术的广泛采用。

Method: 通过进化游戏理论研究自利的创造者和用户的人工群体，分析媒体报道对合作行为的影响。

Result: 媒体确实能够促进创造者与用户之间的合作，但如果媒体信息质量不够可靠，或者访问媒体或确保安全的成本过高，合作就无法形成。

Conclusion: 媒体通过形成公众意识和让开发者承担责任，在没有政府监管的情况下也能够成为强大的软性监管方式，引导AI安全发展。

Abstract: When developers of artificial intelligence (AI) products need to decide
between profit and safety for the users, they likely choose profit.
Untrustworthy AI technology must come packaged with tangible negative
consequences. Here, we envisage those consequences as the loss of reputation
caused by media coverage of their misdeeds, disseminated to the public. We
explore whether media coverage has the potential to push AI creators into the
production of safe products, enabling widespread adoption of AI technology. We
created artificial populations of self-interested creators and users and
studied them through the lens of evolutionary game theory. Our results reveal
that media is indeed able to foster cooperation between creators and users, but
not always. Cooperation does not evolve if the quality of the information
provided by the media is not reliable enough, or if the costs of either
accessing media or ensuring safety are too high. By shaping public perception
and holding developers accountable, media emerges as a powerful soft regulator
-- guiding AI safety even in the absence of formal government oversight.

Conclusion: VLWM展示了强大的世界建模能力，通过结合语义理解和规划优化，为复杂环境中的有效规划提供了新的解决方案

Abstract: Effective planning requires strong world models, but high-level world models
that can understand and reason about actions with semantic and temporal
abstraction remain largely underdeveloped. We introduce the Vision Language
World Model (VLWM), a foundation model trained for language-based world
modeling on natural videos. Given visual observations, the VLWM first infers
the overall goal achievements then predicts a trajectory composed of
interleaved actions and world state changes. Those targets are extracted by
iterative LLM Self-Refine conditioned on compressed future observations
represented by Tree of Captions. The VLWM learns both an action policy and a
dynamics model, which respectively facilitates reactive system-1 plan decoding
and reflective system-2 planning via cost minimization. The cost evaluates the
semantic distance between the hypothetical future states given by VLWM
roll-outs and the expected goal state, and is measured by a critic model that
we trained in a self-supervised manner. The VLWM achieves state-of-the-art
Visual Planning for Assistance (VPA) performance on both benchmark evaluations
and our proposed PlannerArena human evaluations, where system-2 improves the
Elo score by +27% upon system-1. The VLWM models also outperforms strong VLM
baselines on RoboVQA and WorldPrediction benchmark.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新的AI驱动分析运行时，结合了语义运算符的优化执行和深度研究系统的灵活性，通过让LLM组件编写优化的语义运算符程序来提高查询性能和效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有语义运算符在大规模数据集上执行成本高、不适合交互式分析的问题，以及深度研究系统缺乏查询计划优化导致执行性能差的问题。

Method: 构建原型系统，让深度研究系统中的LLM组件能够编写并执行经过优化的语义运算符程序，结合了两种方法的优势。

Result: 在两个基础查询上，原型系统超过了手工编写的语义运算符程序和开源深度研究系统，相比标准深度研究组件获得了最高1.95倍的F1分数提升，成本和运行时间节省最高达76.8%和72.7%。

Conclusion: 通过结合语义运算符的优化执行和深度研究系统的灵活性，可以构建更高效的AI驱动分析运行时，为大规模非结构化数据集的交互式分析提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: With advances in large language models (LLMs), researchers are creating new
systems that can perform AI-driven analytics over large unstructured datasets.
Recent work has explored executing such analytics queries using semantic
operators -- a declarative set of AI-powered data transformations with natural
language specifications. However, even when optimized, these operators can be
expensive to execute on millions of records and their iterator execution
semantics make them ill-suited for interactive data analytics tasks. In another
line of work, Deep Research systems have demonstrated an ability to answer
natural language question(s) over large datasets. These systems use one or more
LLM agent(s) to plan their execution, process the dataset(s), and iteratively
refine their answer. However, these systems do not explicitly optimize their
query plans which can lead to poor plan execution. In order for AI-driven
analytics to excel, we need a runtime which combines the optimized execution of
semantic operators with the flexibility and more dynamic execution of Deep
Research systems. As a first step towards this vision, we build a prototype
which enables Deep Research agents to write and execute optimized semantic
operator programs. We evaluate our prototype and demonstrate that it can
outperform a handcrafted semantic operator program and open Deep Research
systems on two basic queries. Compared to a standard open Deep Research agent,
our prototype achieves up to 1.95x better F1-score. Furthermore, even if we
give the agent access to semantic operators as tools, our prototype still
achieves cost and runtime savings of up to 76.8% and 72.7% thanks to its
optimized execution.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在自然语言处理领域的突破启发其在结构相似问题（如自动驾驶运动生成）中的应用，但缺乏对哪些LLM模块真正可迁移的系统理解

Method: 在Waymo Sim Agents基准上全面评估五个关键LLM模块的可迁移性，分析不同技术的适配需求和失败原因

Result: 实验表明适当适配的LLM模块能显著提升自动驾驶运动生成性能，在Sim Agents任务上取得有竞争力的结果

Conclusion: LLM模块可以成功迁移到自动驾驶运动生成领域，但需要针对具体场景进行适当适配，研究为跨领域技术迁移提供了系统指导

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in large language models (LLMs) have not only advanced
natural language processing but also inspired their application in domains with
structurally similar problems--most notably, autonomous driving motion
generation. Both domains involve autoregressive sequence modeling, token-based
representations, and context-aware decision making, making the transfer of LLM
components a natural and increasingly common practice. However, despite
promising early attempts, a systematic understanding of which LLM modules are
truly transferable remains lacking. In this paper, we present a comprehensive
evaluation of five key LLM modules--tokenizer design, positional embedding,
pre-training paradigms, post-training strategies, and test-time
computation--within the context of motion generation for autonomous driving.
Through extensive experiments on the Waymo Sim Agents benchmark, we demonstrate
that, when appropriately adapted, these modules can significantly improve
performance for autonomous driving motion generation. In addition, we identify
which techniques can be effectively transferred, analyze the potential reasons
for the failure of others, and discuss the specific adaptations needed for
autonomous driving scenarios. We evaluate our method on the Sim Agents task and
achieve competitive results.

Motivation: 解决LLM生成的体现AI任务计划存在噪声、冗余动作、逻辑错误等问题，影响策略质量

Method: 设计迭代验证框架，通过自然语言提示让Judge LLM批评动作序列，Planner LLM应用修订，产生更清洁的轨迹

Result: 在TEACh数据集上达到90%回归率和100%精确度，96.5%序列仅3次迭代内收敛，提升时间效率和空间动作组织

Conclusion: 证明计划验证是LLM的可靠能力，为体现AI仿真学习提供了可扩展的高质量训练数据生成途径

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) based task plans and corresponding human
demonstrations for embodied AI may be noisy, with unnecessary actions,
redundant navigation, and logical errors that reduce policy quality. We propose
an iterative verification framework in which a Judge LLM critiques action
sequences and a Planner LLM applies the revisions, yielding progressively
cleaner and more spatially coherent trajectories. Unlike rule-based approaches,
our method relies on natural language prompting, enabling broad generalization
across error types including irrelevant actions, contradictions, and missing
steps. On a set of manually annotated actions from the TEACh embodied AI
dataset, our framework achieves up to 90% recall and 100% precision across four
state-of-the-art LLMs (GPT o4-mini, DeepSeek-R1, Gemini 2.5, LLaMA 4 Scout).
The refinement loop converges quickly, with 96.5% of sequences requiring at
most three iterations, while improving both temporal efficiency and spatial
action organization. Crucially, the method preserves human error-recovery
patterns rather than collapsing them, supporting future work on robust
corrective behavior. By establishing plan verification as a reliable LLM
capability for spatial planning and action refinement, we provide a scalable
path to higher-quality training data for imitation learning in embodied AI.

TL;DR: 通过系统分析低级赋值算法集合的战略转换，包括解决方案接受、算法重复和批动强度，使平凡的随机选择机制超过了现有最先进超赋值算法。


<details>

Motivation: 现有选择型超赋值算法主要关注从预定义集合中适应性选择低级赋值算法，而本文重点研究如何构建和转换这个算法集合的战略性设计。

Method: 系统分析基于三个关键原则的转换：解决方案接受、低级赋值算法重复执行、批动强度（批动型算法影响解的比例），并在平凡的随机选择机制上验证效果。

Result: 适当构造的转换策略使简单的随机选择方法在3个实际领域超过所有现有最先进超赋值算法，发现11个新的最优解，并在CHeSC竞赛标准测试中具有竞争力。

Conclusion: 战略性转换能够显著提升超赋值算法的性能，在CHeSC标准测试和实际领域都超过了当前最先进方法，同时简化了算法设计。

Abstract: Cross-domain selection hyper-heuristics aim to distill decades of research on
problem-specific heuristic search algorithms into adaptable general-purpose
search strategies. In this respect, existing selection hyper-heuristics
primarily focus on an adaptive selection of low-level heuristics (LLHs) from a
predefined set. In contrast, we concentrate on the composition of this set and
its strategic transformations. We systematically analyze transformations based
on three key principles: solution acceptance, LLH repetitions, and perturbation
intensity, i.e., the proportion of a solution affected by a perturbative LLH.
We demonstrate the raw effects of our transformations on a trivial unbiased
random selection mechanism. With an appropriately constructed transformation,
this trivial method outperforms all available state-of-the-art hyper-heuristics
on three challenging real-world domains and finds 11 new best-known solutions.
The same method is competitive with the winner of the CHeSC competition,
commonly used as the standard cross-domain benchmark. Moreover, we accompany
several recent hyper-heuristics with such strategic transformations. Using this
approach, we outperform the current state-of-the-art methods on both the CHeSC
benchmark and real-world domains while often simplifying their designs.

Result: 方法能够有效处理包含数百万状态和数十万特征的大规模问题，在多个基准测试中展现了良好的可扩展性。

Conclusion: 该方法解决了符号学习方法在大规模问题上的扩展性限制，为学习可理解和正确的大规模策略提供了有效途径。

Abstract: Combinatorial methods for learning general policies that solve large
collections of planning problems have been recently developed. One of their
strengths, in relation to deep learning approaches, is that the resulting
policies can be understood and shown to be correct. A weakness is that the
methods do not scale up and learn only from small training instances and
feature pools that contain a few hundreds of states and features at most. In
this work, we propose a new symbolic method for learning policies based on the
generalization of sampled plans that ensures structural termination and hence
acyclicity. The proposed learning approach is not based on SAT/ASP, as previous
symbolic methods, but on a hitting set algorithm that can effectively handle
problems with millions of states, and pools with hundreds of thousands of
features. The formal properties of the approach are analyzed, and its
scalability is tested on a number of benchmarks.

Motivation: 解决自适应探索方法中的关键问题：如何在探索和利用之间适时切换，特别是在需要学习长序列动作的复杂领域。

Method: 提出一个通用的自适应探索框架，利用不确定性来原则性地处理切换问题，可结合内在动机或认知不确定性等任意不确定性测量机制。

Conclusion: 该框架不仅包含了以往的自适应探索方法，而且提供了一种通用的方式来通过不确定性管理探索-利用切换问题，在实验中表现优异。

Abstract: Adaptive exploration methods propose ways to learn complex policies via
alternating between exploration and exploitation. An important question for
such methods is to determine the appropriate moment to switch between
exploration and exploitation and vice versa. This is critical in domains that
require the learning of long and complex sequences of actions. In this work, we
present a generic adaptive exploration framework that employs uncertainty to
address this important issue in a principled manner. Our framework includes
previous adaptive exploration approaches as special cases. Moreover, we can
incorporate in our framework any uncertainty-measuring mechanism of choice, for
instance mechanisms used in intrinsic motivation or epistemic uncertainty-based
exploration methods. We experimentally demonstrate that our framework gives
rise to adaptive exploration strategies that outperform standard ones across
several MuJoCo environments.

Motivation: 医疗AI决策的负责任问题日益重要，但相关指南过于高层次且模糊，导致实际操作困难。不同行为体对负责任的理解和处理方式存在差异，需要更具体的实施指导。

Method: 通过深入分析负责任概念，构建了一个负责任框架和三层结构。该框架将医疗AI系统的相关规定与行为体采用的机制统一在一个一致的负责任体系下，三层结构按行为分类机制。

Abstract: AI is transforming the healthcare domain and is increasingly helping
practitioners to make health-related decisions. Therefore, accountability
becomes a crucial concern for critical AI-driven decisions. Although regulatory
bodies, such as the EU commission, provide guidelines, they are highlevel and
focus on the ''what'' that should be done and less on the ''how'', creating a
knowledge gap for actors. Through an extensive analysis, we found that the term
accountability is perceived and dealt with in many different ways, depending on
the actor's expertise and domain of work. With increasing concerns about AI
accountability issues and the ambiguity around this term, this paper bridges
the gap between the ''what'' and ''how'' of AI accountability, specifically for
AI systems in healthcare. We do this by analysing the concept of
accountability, formulating an accountability framework, and providing a
three-tier structure for handling various accountability mechanisms. Our
accountability framework positions the regulations of healthcare AI systems and
the mechanisms adopted by the actors under a consistent accountability regime.
Moreover, the three-tier structure guides the actors of the healthcare AI
system to categorise the mechanisms based on their conduct. Through our
framework, we advocate that decision-making in healthcare AI holds shared
dependencies, where accountability should be dealt with jointly and should
foster collaborations. We highlight the role of explainability in instigating
communication and information sharing between the actors to further facilitate
the collaborative process.

Abstract: We present app.build (https://github.com/appdotbuild/agent/), an open-source
framework that improves LLM-based application generation through systematic
validation and structured environments. Our approach combines multi-layered
validation pipelines, stack-specific orchestration, and model-agnostic
architecture, implemented across three reference stacks. Through evaluation on
30 generation tasks, we demonstrate that comprehensive validation achieves
73.3% viability rate with 30% reaching perfect quality scores, while
open-weights models achieve 80.8% of closed-model performance when provided
structured environments. The open-source framework has been adopted by the
community, with over 3,000 applications generated to date. This work
demonstrates that scaling reliable AI agents requires scaling environments, not
just models -- providing empirical insights and complete reference
implementations for production-oriented agent systems.

Motivation: 当前大多数AI推理研究集中在演绎推理上，而归纳和溯因推理在解决现实问题中同样重要但较少被探索，需要系统评估LLMs在这些推理类型上的能力。

Method: 创建了可编程的合成数据集InAbHyD，包含不完整的世界模型和观察数据，要求智能体生成解释观察的假设，并基于奥卡姆剃刀原理提出新的评估指标。

Result: 评估显示LLMs在简单场景中能够进行归纳和溯因推理，但在复杂世界模型中表现不佳，即使使用上下文学习和RLVR等推理增强技术也难以产生高质量假设。

Conclusion: LLMs在归纳和溯因推理方面仍有局限性，特别是在处理复杂场景和生成高质量解释方面需要进一步改进。

Abstract: Reasoning is a core capability in artificial intelligence systems, for which
large language models (LLMs) have recently shown remarkable progress. However,
most work focuses exclusively on deductive reasoning, which is problematic
since other types of reasoning are also essential in solving real-world
problems, and they are less explored. This work focuses on evaluating LLMs'
inductive and abductive reasoning capabilities. We introduce a programmable and
synthetic dataset, InAbHyD (pronounced in-a-bid), where each reasoning example
consists of an incomplete world model and a set of observations. The task for
the intelligent agent is to produce hypotheses to explain observations under
the incomplete world model to solve each reasoning example. We propose a new
metric to evaluate the quality of hypotheses based on Occam's Razor. We
evaluate and analyze some state-of-the-art LLMs. Our analysis shows that LLMs
can perform inductive and abductive reasoning in simple scenarios, but struggle
with complex world models and producing high-quality hypotheses, even with
popular reasoning-enhancing techniques such as in-context learning and RLVR.

Result: 相比典型架构83%的信息泄漏率，aspective agentic AI实现了零信息泄漏

Conclusion: 专业智能体在各自信息生态位中高效工作的概念可以同时提升安全性和效率

Abstract: Agentic LLM AI agents are often little more than autonomous chatbots: actors
following scripts, often controlled by an unreliable director. This work
introduces a bottom-up framework that situates AI agents in their environment,
with all behaviors triggered by changes in their environments. It introduces
the notion of aspects, similar to the idea of umwelt, where sets of agents
perceive their environment differently to each other, enabling clearer control
of information. We provide an illustrative implementation and show that
compared to a typical architecture, which leaks up to 83% of the time,
aspective agentic AI enables zero information leakage. We anticipate that this
concept of specialist agents working efficiently in their own information
niches can provide improvements to both security and efficiency.

Conclusion: 研究暴露了具身AI系统中先前未被充分探索但后果严重的攻击面，强调了物理AI时代安全驱动防御的紧迫需求。代码已开源。

Abstract: The integration of vision-language-action (VLA) models into embodied AI (EAI)
robots is rapidly advancing their ability to perform complex, long-horizon
tasks in humancentric environments. However, EAI systems introduce critical
security risks: a compromised VLA model can directly translate adversarial
perturbations on sensory input into unsafe physical actions. Traditional safety
definitions and methodologies from the machine learning community are no longer
sufficient. EAI systems raise new questions, such as what constitutes safety,
how to measure it, and how to design effective attack and defense mechanisms in
physically grounded, interactive settings. In this work, we present the first
systematic study of adversarial safety attacks on embodied AI systems, grounded
in ISO standards for human-robot interactions. We (1) formalize a principled
taxonomy of safety violations (critical, dangerous, risky) based on physical
constraints such as separation distance, velocity, and collision boundaries;
(2) introduce ANNIEBench, a benchmark of nine safety-critical scenarios with
2,400 video-action sequences for evaluating embodied safety; and (3)
ANNIE-Attack, a task-aware adversarial framework with an attack leader model
that decomposes long-horizon goals into frame-level perturbations. Our
evaluation across representative EAI models shows attack success rates
exceeding 50% across all safety categories. We further demonstrate sparse and
adaptive attack strategies and validate the real-world impact through physical
robot experiments. These results expose a previously underexplored but highly
consequential attack surface in embodied AI systems, highlighting the urgent
need for security-driven defenses in the physical AI era. Code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统坐标预测方法缺乏物理可解释性和计算效率低的问题，通过参数化输出实现物理上合理的轨迹预测。

Method: 微调大语言模型输出轨迹模型的核心物理参数（横向位移、机动持续时间、初始横向速度、纵向速度变化），而非原始坐标。车道保持时预测离散坐标，车道变换时生成增强正弦加速度模型参数。

Result: 输出大小比基于坐标的方法减少80%，整体意图预测准确率达到98.73%的先进水平，性能与传统LLM预测器相当。

Conclusion: SAM-LLM在保持高性能的同时，提供了显著的可解释性和资源效率优势，为自动驾驶轨迹预测提供了物理上合理且计算高效的解决方案。

Abstract: This work introduces SAM-LLM, a novel hybrid architecture that bridges the
gap between the contextual reasoning of Large Language Models (LLMs) and the
physical precision of kinematic lane change models for autonomous driving. The
system is designed for interpretable lane change trajectory prediction by
finetuning an LLM to output the core physical parameters of a trajectory model
instead of raw coordinates. For lane-keeping scenarios, the model predicts
discrete coordinates, but for lane change maneuvers, it generates the
parameters for an enhanced Sinusoidal Acceleration Model (SAM), including
lateral displacement, maneuver duration, initial lateral velocity, and
longitudinal velocity change. This parametric approach yields a complete,
continuous, and physically plausible trajectory model that is inherently
interpretable and computationally efficient, achieving an 80% reduction in
output size compared to coordinate-based methods. The SAM-LLM achieves a
state-of-the-art overall intention prediction accuracy of 98.73%, demonstrating
performance equivalent to traditional LLM predictors while offering significant
advantages in explainability and resource efficiency.

TL;DR: 通过长期低活化神经元来实现更强的正则化，采用状态记忆机制避免神经元复活时的训练不稳定性，提升了模型的沿升性能和稳健性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统正则化方法如Dropout只是临时急活神经元，本文探索长期低活化神经元的更强正则化效果，但这种方法引发了神经元复活时的训练不稳定性问题。

Method: 提出Lifecycle(LC)原则，核心是状态记忆机制。当神经元复活时，不是重新初始化权重，而是恢复到其上次有效运行时的参数状态，保留学到的知识并避免破坏性的优化冲击。

Result: 理论分析显示LC原则能够平滑损失函数地形，导向更平坦的最小值，这与更好的沿升性能相关。图像分类实验证明方法提升了沿升性能和稳健性。

Conclusion: 状态记忆机制是实现长期神经元低活化正则化的关键，能够有效解决训练不稳定性问题，为深度学习模型提供更好的沿升性能。

Abstract: I investigate a stronger form of regularization by deactivating neurons for
extended periods, a departure from the temporary changes of methods like
Dropout. However, this long-term dynamism introduces a critical challenge:
severe training instability when neurons are revived with random weights. To
solve this, I propose the Lifecycle (LC) principle, a regularization mechanism
centered on a key innovation: state memory. Instead of re-initializing a
revived neuron, my method restores its parameters to their last known effective
state. This process preserves learned knowledge and avoids destructive
optimization shocks. My theoretical analysis reveals that the LC principle
smooths the loss landscape, guiding optimization towards flatter minima
associated with better generalization. Experiments on image classification
benchmarks demonstrate that my method improves generalization and robustness.
Crucially, ablation studies confirm that state memory is essential for
achieving these gains.

Abstract: Protecting endangered wildlife from illegal poaching presents a critical

real-time response is essential. This paper introduces a novel
Expectation-Maximization (EM) based latent variable modeling approach in the
context of Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) for Unmanned Aerial

### [83] [Beyond Synthetic Augmentation: Group-Aware Threshold Calibration for Robust Balanced Accuracy in Imbalanced Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02592)
*Hunter Gittlin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 群体感知阈值校准方法通过为不同人口群体设置不同决策阈值，在类别不平衡问题上比传统合成数据生成方法表现更优，实现更高的平衡准确率和最差群体平衡准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 类别不平衡是机器学习中的基础挑战，传统解决方案往往带来新问题。需要找到更稳健、更有效的方法来处理不同人口群体间的性能差异。

Method: 提出群体感知阈值校准方法，为不同人口群体设置不同的决策阈值，而不是对所有群体使用单一阈值。该方法优化平衡准确率和最差群体平衡准确率之间的帕累托前沿。

Result: 实验显示群体特定阈值比SMOTE和CT-GAN增强模型获得1.5-4%更高的平衡准确率，同时改善最差群体平衡准确率。在七个模型家族中均得到验证。

Conclusion: 群体感知阈值校准提供了一种更简单、更可解释、更有效的类别不平衡解决方案，且发现将群体阈值应用于合成增强数据几乎没有额外收益，表明这些方法是冗余的。

Abstract: Class imbalance remains a fundamental challenge in machine learning, with
traditional solutions often creating as many problems as they solve. We
demonstrate that group-aware threshold calibration--setting different decision
thresholds for different demographic groups--provides superior robustness
compared to synthetic data generation methods. Through extensive experiments,
we show that group-specific thresholds achieve 1.5-4% higher balanced accuracy
than SMOTE and CT-GAN augmented models while improving worst-group balanced
accuracy. Unlike single-threshold approaches that apply one cutoff across all
groups, our group-aware method optimizes the Pareto frontier between balanced
accuracy and worst-group balanced accuracy, enabling fine-grained control over
group-level performance. Critically, we find that applying group thresholds to
synthetically augmented data yields minimal additional benefit, suggesting
these approaches are fundamentally redundant. Our results span seven model
families including linear, tree-based, instance-based, and boosting methods,
confirming that group-aware threshold calibration offers a simpler, more
interpretable, and more effective solution to class imbalance.

TL;DR: 提出DPO-PRO算法，基于DPO的鲁棒微调方法，用于公共卫生资源分配问题的奖励函数设计，相比现有方法更不保守且推理成本更低


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 公共卫生领域的顺序资源分配问题具有复杂模糊的目标和有限的数据可用性，需要设计能够处理偏好不确定性的鲁棒奖励函数

Method: 基于直接偏好优化(DPO)，采用轻量级分布鲁棒优化(DRO)公式来考虑偏好分布的不确定性

Result: 在真实世界母婴移动健康项目和标准对齐基准测试中，相比现有DPO变体显著提高了对噪声偏好信号的鲁棒性，性能与自反思基线相当但推理成本显著降低

Conclusion: DPO-PRO是一种有效的鲁棒微调算法，能够在复杂公共卫生场景中处理偏好不确定性，同时保持较低的计算成本

Abstract: We study an LLM fine-tuning task for designing reward functions for
sequential resource allocation problems in public health, guided by human
preferences expressed in natural language. This setting presents a challenging
testbed for alignment due to complex and ambiguous objectives and limited data
availability. We propose DPO-PRO, a robust fine-tuning algorithm based on
Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), which accounts for uncertainty in the
preference distribution using a lightweight Distributionally Robust
Optimization (DRO) formulation. Unlike prior DRO-based DPO methods, DPO-PRO is
significantly less conservative. We evaluate DPO-PRO on a real-world maternal
mobile health program operated by the non-profit organization ARMMAN, as well
as on standard alignment benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate that our
method consistently improves robustness to noisy preference signals compared to
existing DPO variants. Moreover, DPO-PRO achieves comparable performance to
prior self-reflection-based baseline for reward function design, while
requiring significantly lower inference-time cost.

Motivation: 发现在最优策略DNN中存在类似神经缩结的Action Collapse现象，ETF结构能最大化动作间分离度，从而提出使用固定ETF作为目标配置来学习最优策略

Method: 提出Action Collapse Policy Gradient (ACPG)方法，在动作选择层中设置合成的等角紧凑框架(ETF)结构，促使策略DNN产生理想配置

Result: 在多个OpenAI Gym环境中证明，ACPG可集成到任何离散策略梯度方法中，更快速、更稳健地实现更好的奖励收益

Conclusion: 通过主动引入ETF结构目标，ACPG方法能够有效地促进动作缩结现象，提升策略梯度方法的学习效率和稳定性

Abstract: Policy gradient (PG) methods in reinforcement learning frequently utilize
deep neural networks (DNNs) to learn a shared backbone of feature
representations used to compute likelihoods in an action selection layer.
Numerous studies have been conducted on the convergence and global optima of
policy networks, but few have analyzed representational structures of those
underlying networks. While training an optimal policy DNN, we observed that
under certain constraints, a gentle structure resembling neural collapse, which
we refer to as Action Collapse (AC), emerges. This suggests that 1) the
state-action activations (i.e. last-layer features) sharing the same optimal
actions collapse towards those optimal actions respective mean activations; 2)
the variability of activations sharing the same optimal actions converges to
zero; 3) the weights of action selection layer and the mean activations
collapse to a simplex equiangular tight frame (ETF). Our early work showed
those aforementioned constraints to be necessary for these observations. Since
the collapsed ETF of optimal policy DNNs maximally separates the pair-wise
angles of all actions in the state-action space, we naturally raise a question:
can we learn an optimal policy using an ETF structure as a (fixed) target
configuration in the action selection layer? Our analytical proof shows that
learning activations with a fixed ETF as action selection layer naturally leads
to the AC. We thus propose the Action Collapse Policy Gradient (ACPG) method,
which accordingly affixes a synthetic ETF as our action selection layer. ACPG
induces the policy DNN to produce such an ideal configuration in the action
selection layer while remaining optimal. Our experiments across various OpenAI
Gym environments demonstrate that our technique can be integrated into any
discrete PG methods and lead to favorable reward improvements more quickly and
robustly.

TL;DR: 使用Mamba选择性状态空间模型作为基础模型，通过自监督重建任务和癫痫检测任务训练，在EEG数据分析中取得0.72 AUROC性能，为开发临床适用的EEG基础模型迈出重要一步。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: EEG信号噪声大、高维度、非线性，传统机器学习方法难以捕捉其复杂的时空动态特性，需要更强大的序列建模方法来提升神经疾病诊断的自动化分析能力。

Method: 采用Mamba选择性状态空间模型，在大规模包含癫痫和非癫痫EEG记录的数据集上，先进行自监督重建任务预训练，然后进行癫痫检测任务微调。

Result: 在保留测试集上达到0.72的AUROC分数，证明了该方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 这项工作展示了基础模型在EEG分析中的潜力，为开发大规模临床适用的EEG基础模型奠定了重要基础。

Abstract: This work explores the potential of foundation models, specifically a
Mamba-based selective state space model, for enhancing EEG analysis in
neurological disorder diagnosis. EEG, crucial for diagnosing conditions like
epilepsy, presents significant challenges due to its noisy, high-dimensional,
and nonlinear nature. Traditional machine learning methods have made advances
in automating EEG analysis but often fail to capture its complex
spatio-temporal dynamics. Recent advances in deep learning, particularly in
sequence modeling, offer new avenues for creating more generalized and
expressive models capable of handling such complexities. By training a
Mamba-based model on a large dataset containing seizure and non-seizure EEG
recordings through a self-supervised reconstruction task followed by a seizure
detection task, we demonstrate the model's effectiveness, achieving an AUROC of
0.72 on a held-out test set. This approach marks a significant step toward
developing large-scale, clinically applicable foundation models for EEG data
analysis.

TL;DR: LExI是一种无需数据的优化技术，通过分析模型权重自适应确定每层最优激活专家数量，显著提升MoE模型推理效率且精度损失可忽略


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MoE剪枝方法主要减少内存占用但无法显著提升GPU推理性能，且固定激活专家数量导致冗余计算和次优性能

Method: LExI利用模型权重估计每层相对重要性，自适应分配每层激活专家数量，无需训练数据

Result: 在语言和视觉MoE基准测试中，LExI显著优于传统剪枝方法，Qwen1.5-MoE在H100 GPU上实现相同吞吐量且精度提升10%

Conclusion: LExI通过层间专家数量自适应分配有效解决了MoE模型推理效率问题，为稀疏架构优化提供了新方向

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models scale efficiently by activating only a subset
of experts per token, offering a computationally sparse alternative to dense
architectures. While prior post-training optimizations, such as inter- and
intra-expert pruning, reduce memory usage they provide limited gains in
inference-time compute efficiency. Moreover, existing MoE architectures
typically activate a fixed number of experts uniformly across all layers,
resulting in redundant computation and suboptimal performance. In this work, we
first demonstrate that MoE pruning strategies improve only the memory footprint
but do not significantly improve inference performance on GPU using optimized
frameworks such as vLLM. To address this, we introduce LExI, a data-free
optimization technique that determines the optimal number of active experts per
layer in a pretrained MoE model. LExI leverages only the model weights to
estimate the relative importance of each layer and adaptively assigns the
number of active experts accordingly per layer. Experiments on state-of-the-art
language and vision MoE benchmarks demonstrate that LExI significantly
outperforms traditional MoE pruning approaches in terms of inference efficiency
with negligible accuracy loss. For example, using LExI, Qwen1.5-MoE achieves
the same throughput on Nvidia H100 GPU with 10% better accuracy than
traditional expert pruning.

Motivation: 为了解决从不同类型、不同稀疏度和分辨率的地下观测数据中重建地下属性的挑战，需要一种能够处理多模态数据并支持灵活扩展的模型架构。

Method: 采用Transformer架构，结合位置编码和模态编码（通过文本嵌入模型生成），支持八种模态数据（包括方向角度、分类类别和连续属性如温度、厚度等），实现上下文学习和任意模态组合的预测。

Result: 在验证数据上，应力角预测误差减少了三倍以上，模型性能随参数增加而提升，展示了良好的可扩展性。

Conclusion: Transparent Earth作为地球地下基础模型的初步实现，具有处理多模态数据、支持灵活扩展和上下文学习的能力，为预测地球任意位置的地下属性奠定了基础。

Abstract: We present the Transparent Earth, a transformer-based architecture for
reconstructing subsurface properties from heterogeneous datasets that vary in
sparsity, resolution, and modality, where each modality represents a distinct
type of observation (e.g., stress angle, mantle temperature, tectonic plate
type). The model incorporates positional encodings of observations together
with modality encodings, derived from a text embedding model applied to a
description of each modality. This design enables the model to scale to an
arbitrary number of modalities, making it straightforward to add new ones not
considered in the initial design. We currently include eight modalities
spanning directional angles, categorical classes, and continuous properties
such as temperature and thickness. These capabilities support in-context
learning, enabling the model to generate predictions either with no inputs or
with an arbitrary number of additional observations from any subset of
modalities. On validation data, this reduces errors in predicting stress angle
by more than a factor of three. The proposed architecture is scalable and
demonstrates improved performance with increased parameters. Together, these
advances make the Transparent Earth an initial foundation model for the Earth's
subsurface that ultimately aims to predict any subsurface property anywhere on
Earth.

Motivation: 当前物理信息符号回归方法需要专业公式和手动特征工程，限制了非领域专家的使用。研究旨在利用LLMs的上下文理解能力自动整合领域知识，降低人工干预需求。

Method: 将预训练LLMs集成到符号回归的损失函数中，添加LLM对生成方程的评估项。使用三种SR算法(DEAP、gplearn、PySR)和三种LLMs(Falcon、Mistral、LLama 2)在三种物理动力学场景下进行验证。

Conclusion: LLMs可以有效自动化领域知识整合过程，使物理信息符号回归更易于应用于广泛的科学问题，同时提高发现方程的准确性和实用性。

Abstract: Symbolic regression (SR) has emerged as a powerful tool for automated
scientific discovery, enabling the derivation of governing equations from
experimental data. A growing body of work illustrates the promise of
integrating domain knowledge into the SR to improve the discovered equation's
generality and usefulness. Physics-informed SR (PiSR) addresses this by
incorporating domain knowledge, but current methods often require specialized
formulations and manual feature engineering, limiting their adaptability only
to domain experts. In this study, we leverage pre-trained Large Language Models
(LLMs) to facilitate knowledge integration in PiSR. By harnessing the
contextual understanding of LLMs trained on vast scientific literature, we aim
to automate the incorporation of domain knowledge, reducing the need for manual
intervention and making the process more accessible to a broader range of
scientific problems. Namely, the LLM is integrated into the SR's loss function,
adding a term of the LLM's evaluation of the SR's produced equation. We
extensively evaluate our method using three SR algorithms (DEAP, gplearn, and
PySR) and three pre-trained LLMs (Falcon, Mistral, and LLama 2) across three
physical dynamics (dropping ball, simple harmonic motion, and electromagnetic
wave). The results demonstrate that LLM integration consistently improves the
reconstruction of physical dynamics from data, enhancing the robustness of SR
models to noise and complexity. We further explore the impact of prompt
engineering, finding that more informative prompts significantly improve
performance.

Conclusion: 结构化基函数网络提供了一个统一的框架，能够同时处理回归和分类问题，通过几何对齐的预测和可调节的多样性机制有效解决预测不确定性问题。

Abstract: Existing approaches to predictive uncertainty rely either on multi-hypothesis
prediction, which promotes diversity but lacks principled aggregation, or on
ensemble learning, which improves accuracy but rarely captures the structured
ambiguity. This implicitly means that a unified framework consistent with the
loss geometry remains absent. The Structured Basis Function Network addresses
this gap by linking multi-hypothesis prediction and ensembling through
centroidal aggregation induced by Bregman divergences. The formulation applies
across regression and classification by aligning predictions with the geometry
of the loss, and supports both a closed-form least-squares estimator and a
gradient-based procedure for general objectives. A tunable diversity mechanism
provides parametric control of the bias-variance-diversity trade-off,
connecting multi-hypothesis generalisation with loss-aware ensemble
aggregation. Experiments validate this relation and use the mechanism to study
the complexity-capacity-diversity trade-off across datasets of increasing
difficulty with deep-learning predictors.

Conclusion: 该框架提供了一种有效的图神经网络预训练方法，能够更好地学习图的大规模结构模式，具有广泛的适用性和灵活性。

Abstract: We propose a novel framework for pre-training Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) by
inductively learning Laplacian eigenvectors. Traditional Message Passing Neural
Networks (MPNNs) often struggle to capture global and regional graph structure
due to over-smoothing risk as network depth increases. Because the
low-frequency eigenvectors of the graph Laplacian matrix encode global
information, pre-training GNNs to predict these eigenvectors encourages the
network to naturally learn large-scale structural patterns over each graph.
Empirically, we show that models pre-trained via our framework outperform
baseline models on a variety of graph structure-based tasks. While most
existing pre-training methods focus on domain-specific tasks like node or edge
feature reconstruction, our self-supervised pre-training framework is
structure-based and highly flexible. Eigenvector-learning can be applied to all
graph-based datasets, and can be used with synthetic features when
task-specific data is sparse.

Abstract: This paper highlights the challenge of decomposing conflict detection from
conflict resolution in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and presents potential
approaches, including using a supervised metric via linear probes and
group-based attention pattern analysis. We conduct a mechanistic investigation
of LLaVA-OV-7B, a state-of-the-art VLM that exhibits diverse resolution
behaviors when faced with conflicting multimodal inputs. Our results show that
a linearly decodable conflict signal emerges in the model's intermediate layers
and that attention patterns associated with conflict detection and resolution
diverge at different stages of the network. These findings support the
hypothesis that detection and resolution are functionally distinct mechanisms.
We discuss how such decomposition enables more actionable interpretability and
targeted interventions for improving model robustness in challenging multimodal
settings.

Abstract: Detecting elephants through seismic signals is an emerging research topic
aimed at developing solutions for Human-Elephant Conflict (HEC). Despite the
promising results, such solutions heavily rely on manual classification of
elephant footfalls, which limits their applicability for real-time
classification in natural settings. To address this limitation and build on our
previous work, this study introduces a classification framework targeting
resource-constrained implementations, prioritizing both accuracy and
computational efficiency. As part of this framework, a novel event detection
technique named Contextually Customized Windowing (CCW), tailored specifically
for detecting elephant footfalls, was introduced, and evaluations were
conducted by comparing it with the Short-Term Average/Long-Term Average
(STA/LTA) method. The yielded results show that the maximum validated detection
range was 155.6 m in controlled conditions and 140 m in natural environments.
Elephant footfall classification using Support Vector Machine (SVM) with a
Radial Basis Function (RBF) kernel demonstrated superior performance across
multiple settings, achieving an accuracy of 99% in controlled environments, 73%
in natural elephant habitats, and 70% in HEC-prone human habitats, the most
challenging scenario. Furthermore, feature impact analysis using explainable AI
identified the number of Zero Crossings and Dynamic Time Warping (DTW)
Alignment Cost as the most influential factors in all experiments, while
Predominant Frequency exhibited significant influence in controlled settings.

Result: JensUn在广泛实验中比竞争方法获得更好的遗忘-效用权衡，表现出对良性重新学习的强韧性。新的评估框架显示许多现有方法效果不如之前认为的好。

Conclusion: JensUn提供了一种更有效的LLM遗忘方法，配合改进的评估框架能够更准确地评估遗忘性能，为模型安全提供了更好的解决方案。

Abstract: Unlearning in large language models (LLMs) involves precisely removing
specific information from a pre-trained model. This is crucial to ensure safety
of LLMs by deleting private data or harmful knowledge acquired during
pre-training. However, existing unlearning methods often fall short when
subjected to thorough evaluation. To overcome this, we introduce JensUn, where
we leverage the Jensen-Shannon Divergence as the training objective for both
forget and retain sets for more stable and effective unlearning dynamics
compared to commonly used loss functions. In extensive experiments, JensUn
achieves better forget-utility trade-off than competing methods, and even
demonstrates strong resilience to benign relearning. Additionally, for a
precise unlearning evaluation, we introduce LKF, a curated dataset of
lesser-known facts that provides a realistic unlearning scenario. Finally, to
comprehensively test unlearning methods, we propose (i) employing an LLM as
semantic judge instead of the standard ROUGE score, and (ii) using worst-case
unlearning evaluation over various paraphrases and input formats. Our improved
evaluation framework reveals that many existing methods are less effective than
previously thought.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 肥胖是全球急需关注的健康问题，机器学习在早期风险预测中展现了潜力。然而，对于集成技术（特别是混合多数投票和集成堆叠）的比较评估仍有限，需要确定哪种方法能提供更高的准确性和效率。

Method: 使用两个数据集评估三种集成模型：多数硬投票、加权硬投票和堆叠法（以多层感知机作为元分类器）。分析了9种机器学习算法的50个超参数配置，选择前三个模型作为基学习器。预处理步骤包括数据集平衡和离群点检测，使用准确率和F1指标评估模型性能。

Conclusion: 结果证明集成堆叠法提供了更强大的预测能力，尤其适用于复杂的数据分布。同时，混合多数投票仍然是一种稳健的备选方案。这些发现为医疗健康应用中的预测模型选择提供了重要指导。

Abstract: Obesity is a critical global health issue driven by dietary, physiological,
and environmental factors, and is strongly associated with chronic diseases
such as diabetes, cardiovascular disorders, and cancer. Machine learning has
emerged as a promising approach for early obesity risk prediction, yet a
comparative evaluation of ensemble techniques -- particularly hybrid majority
voting and ensemble stacking -- remains limited. This study aims to compare
hybrid majority voting and ensemble stacking methods for obesity risk
prediction, identifying which approach delivers higher accuracy and efficiency.
The analysis seeks to highlight the complementary strengths of these ensemble
techniques in guiding better predictive model selection for healthcare
applications. Two datasets were utilized to evaluate three ensemble models:
Majority Hard Voting, Weighted Hard Voting, and Stacking (with a Multi-Layer
Perceptron as meta-classifier). A pool of nine Machine Learning (ML)
algorithms, evaluated across a total of 50 hyperparameter configurations, was
analyzed to identify the top three models to serve as base learners for the
ensemble methods. Preprocessing steps involved dataset balancing, and outlier
detection, and model performance was evaluated using Accuracy and F1-Score. On
Dataset-1, weighted hard voting and stacking achieved nearly identical
performance (Accuracy: 0.920304, F1: 0.920070), outperforming majority hard
voting. On Dataset-2, stacking demonstrated superior results (Accuracy:
0.989837, F1: 0.989825) compared to majority hard voting (Accuracy: 0.981707,
F1: 0.981675) and weighted hard voting, which showed the lowest performance.
The findings confirm that ensemble stacking provides stronger predictive
capability, particularly for complex data distributions, while hybrid majority
voting remains a robust alternative.

Abstract: Conformal prediction has been explored as a general and efficient way to
provide uncertainty quantification for time series. However, current methods
struggle to handle time series data with change points - sudden shifts in the
underlying data-generating process. In this paper, we propose a novel Conformal
Prediction for Time-series with Change points (CPTC) algorithm, addressing this
gap by integrating a model to predict the underlying state with online
conformal prediction to model uncertainties in non-stationary time series. We
prove CPTC's validity and improved adaptivity in the time series setting under
minimum assumptions, and demonstrate CPTC's practical effectiveness on 6
synthetic and real-world datasets, showing improved validity and adaptivity
compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

Conclusion: TTC框架为更高级的PDE推理算法奠定了基础，包括建立基于强化学习的方法，有望转变物理和工程领域的计算工作流程。

Abstract: Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) are the bedrock for modern
computational sciences and engineering, and inherently computationally
expensive. While PDE foundation models have shown much promise for simulating
such complex spatio-temporal phenomena, existing models remain constrained by
the pretraining datasets and struggle with auto-regressive rollout performance,
especially in out-of-distribution (OOD) cases. Furthermore, they have
significant compute and training data requirements which hamper their use in
many critical applications. Inspired by recent advances in ``thinking"
strategies used in large language models (LLMs), we introduce the first
test-time computing (TTC) strategy for PDEs that utilizes computational
resources during inference to achieve more accurate predictions with fewer
training samples and smaller models. We accomplish this with two types of
reward models that evaluate predictions of a stochastic based model for
spatio-temporal consistency. We demonstrate this method on compressible
Euler-equation simulations from the PDEGym benchmark and show that TTC captures
improved predictions relative to standard non-adaptive auto-regressive
inference. This TTC framework marks a foundational step towards more advanced
reasoning algorithms or PDE modeling, inluding building
reinforcement-learning-based approaches, potentially transforming computational
workflows in physics and engineering.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种基于图神经网络的分布式强化学习框架，用于现代电网的实时管理。该方法通过分解观测和动作空间，结合模仿学习和奖励形式技术，在Grid2Op模拟环境中显著超过了标准基线方法。

Abstract: The necessary integration of renewable energy sources, combined with the
expanding scale of power networks, presents significant challenges in
controlling modern power grids. Traditional control systems, which are human
and optimization-based, struggle to adapt and to scale in such an evolving
context, motivating the exploration of more dynamic and distributed control
strategies. This work advances a graph-based distributed reinforcement learning
framework for real-time, scalable grid management. The proposed architecture
consists of a network of distributed low-level agents acting on individual
power lines and coordinated by a high-level manager agent. A Graph Neural
Network (GNN) is employed to encode the network's topological information
within the single low-level agent's observation. To accelerate convergence and
enhance learning stability, the framework integrates imitation learning and
potential-based reward shaping. In contrast to conventional decentralized
approaches that decompose only the action space while relying on global
observations, this method also decomposes the observation space. Each low-level
agent acts based on a structured and informative local view of the environment
constructed through the GNN. Experiments on the Grid2Op simulation environment
show the effectiveness of the approach, which consistently outperforms the
standard baseline commonly adopted in the field. Additionally, the proposed
model proves to be much more computationally efficient than the
simulation-based Expert method.

Abstract: Class imbalance remains a critical challenge in machine learning (ML),
particularly in the medical domain, where underrepresented minority classes
lead to biased models and reduced predictive performance. This study introduces
Quantum-Inspired SMOTE (QI-SMOTE), a novel data augmentation technique that
enhances the performance of ML classifiers, including Random Forest (RF),
Support Vector Machine (SVM), Logistic Regression (LR), k-Nearest Neighbors
(KNN), Gradient Boosting (GB), and Neural Networks, by leveraging quantum
principles such as quantum evolution and layered entanglement. Unlike
conventional oversampling methods, QI-SMOTE generates synthetic instances that
preserve complex data structures, improving model generalization and
classification accuracy. We validate QI-SMOTE on the MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV
datasets, using mortality detection as a benchmark task due to their clinical
significance and inherent class imbalance. We compare our method against
traditional oversampling techniques, including Borderline-SMOTE, ADASYN,
SMOTE-ENN, SMOTE-TOMEK, and SVM-SMOTE, using key performance metrics such as
Accuracy, F1-score, G-Mean, and AUC-ROC. The results demonstrate that QI-SMOTE
significantly improves the effectiveness of ensemble methods (RF, GB, ADA),
kernel-based models (SVM), and deep learning approaches by producing more
informative and balanced training data. By integrating quantum-inspired
transformations into the ML pipeline, QI-SMOTE not only mitigates class
imbalance but also enhances the robustness and reliability of predictive models
in medical diagnostics and decision-making. This study highlights the potential
of quantum-inspired resampling techniques in advancing state-of-the-art ML

Abstract: Generating synthetic datasets that accurately reflect real-world
observational data is critical for evaluating causal estimators, but remains a
challenging task. Existing generative methods offer a solution by producing
synthetic datasets anchored in the observed data (source data) while allowing
variation in key parameters such as the treatment effect and amount of
confounding bias. However, existing methods typically require users to provide
point estimates of such parameters (rather than distributions) and fixed
estimates (rather than estimates that can be improved with reference to the
source data). This denies users the ability to express uncertainty over
parameter values and removes the potential for posterior inference, potentially
leading to unreliable estimator comparisons. We introduce simulation-based
inference for causal evaluation (SBICE), a framework that models generative
parameters as uncertain and infers their posterior distribution given a source
dataset. Leveraging techniques in simulation-based inference, SBICE identifies
parameter configurations that produce synthetic datasets closely aligned with
the source data distribution. Empirical results demonstrate that SBICE improves
the reliability of estimator evaluations by generating more realistic datasets,
which supports a robust and data-consistent approach to causal benchmarking
under uncertainty.

Abstract: Offloading footwear helps prevent and treat diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) by
lowering plantar pressure (PP), yet prescription decisions remain fragmented:
feature selection varies, personalization is limited, and evaluation practices
differ. We performed a narrative review of 45 studies (12 guidelines/protocols,
25 knowledge-based systems, 8 machine-learning applications) published to Aug
2025. We thematically analyzed knowledge type, decision logic, evaluation
methods, and enabling technologies. Guidelines emphasize PP thresholds (<=200
kPa or >=25--30\% reduction) but rarely yield actionable, feature-level
outputs. Knowledge-based systems use rule- and sensor-driven logic, integrating
PP monitoring, adherence tracking, and usability testing. ML work introduces
predictive, optimization, and generative models with high computational
accuracy but limited explainability and clinical validation. Evaluation remains
fragmented: protocols prioritize biomechanical tests; knowledge-based systems
assess usability/adherence; ML studies focus on technical accuracy with weak
linkage to long-term outcomes. From this synthesis we propose a five-part CDSS
framework: (1) a minimum viable dataset; (2) a hybrid architecture combining
rules, optimization, and explainable ML; (3) structured feature-level outputs;
(4) continuous validation and evaluation; and (5) integration with clinical and
telehealth workflows. This framework aims to enable scalable, patient-centered
CDSSs for DFU care; prioritizing interoperable datasets, explainable models,
and outcome-focused evaluation will be key to clinical adoption.

Conclusion: PDRL提供了一种简单高效的后处理方案，能够在不影响已训练模型的情况下实现不确定性量化，为MLIP的UQ提供了替代选择。

Abstract: Ensemble method is considered the gold standard for uncertainty
quantification (UQ) for machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs).
However, their high computational cost can limit its practicality. Alternative
techniques, such as Monte Carlo dropout and deep kernel learning, have been
proposed to improve computational efficiency; however, some of these methods
cannot be applied to already trained models and may affect the prediction
accuracy. In this paper, we propose a simple and efficient post-hoc framework
for UQ that leverages the descriptor of a trained graph neural network
potential to estimate residual errors. We refer to this method as post-hoc
descriptor-based residual-based learning (PDRL). PDRL models the discrepancy
between MLIP predictions and ground truth values, allowing these residuals to
act as proxies for prediction uncertainty. We explore multiple variants of PDRL
and benchmark them against established UQ methods, evaluating both their
effectiveness and limitations.

TL;DR: 本文提出了VendiRL框架，利用生态学中的Vendi Score指标来评估和学习多样化的技能，解决了自监督强化学习中技能多样性的定义和评估难题。


<details>

Motivation: 自监督强化学习中，学习多样化技能以应对未知任务是一个关键挑战。现有方法在可扩展性和评估方面存在问题：高维特征空间中相关特征难以识别，且技能多样性的定义通常需要硬性承诺特定概念，导致结果难以比较和多样性探索不足。

Method: 采用生态学中的Vendi Score指标来衡量样本多样性，允许用户指定和评估任何期望的多样性形式。基于此提出了VendiRL统一框架，通过不同的相似性函数来激励不同形式的多样性。

Result: VendiRL框架能够促进技能评估，并在新的丰富交互环境中支持技能多样性预训练，其中优化各种形式的多样性可能是可取的。

Conclusion: Vendi Score指标为技能多样性评估提供了灵活的方法，VendiRL框架为学习多样化技能集提供了统一的方法论，有望在复杂环境中推动技能多样性学习的发展。

Abstract: In self-supervised reinforcement learning (RL), one of the key challenges is
learning a diverse set of skills to prepare agents for unknown future tasks.
Despite impressive advances, scalability and evaluation remain prevalent
issues. Regarding scalability, the search for meaningful skills can be obscured
by high-dimensional feature spaces, where relevant features may vary across
downstream task domains. For evaluating skill diversity, defining what
constitutes "diversity" typically requires a hard commitment to a specific
notion of what it means for skills to be diverse, potentially leading to
inconsistencies in how skill diversity is understood, making results across
different approaches hard to compare, and leaving many forms of diversity
unexplored. To address these issues, we adopt a measure of sample diversity
that translates ideas from ecology to machine learning -- the Vendi Score --
allowing the user to specify and evaluate any desired form of diversity. We
demonstrate how this metric facilitates skill evaluation and introduce VendiRL,
a unified framework for learning diversely diverse sets of skills. Given
distinct similarity functions, VendiRL motivates distinct forms of diversity,
which could support skill-diversity pretraining in new and richly interactive
environments where optimising for various forms of diversity may be desirable.

Motivation: 传统神经网络在信号频谱分析中面临挑战，特别是处理具有不可通约频率的非周期信号叠加时，传统ARIMA模型往往优于神经网络。需要结合两种方法的优势来解决这个问题。

Method: 提出Autoregressive-Weight-Enhanced AR-KAN混合模型，使用Kolmogorov-Arnold Network（KAN）处理静态非线性部分，通过预训练的AR组件引入记忆机制，保留有用信息并消除冗余。

Result: 实验数据显示，AR-KAN在72%的真实世界数据集上取得了优于其他方法的性能表现。

Conclusion: AR-KAN模型成功结合了神经网络和传统时间序列方法的优势，在处理复杂非周期信号方面表现出色，为解决频谱分析中的挑战提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Conventional neural networks frequently face challenges in spectral analysis
of signals. To address this challenge, Fourier neural networks (FNNs) and
similar approaches integrate components of Fourier series into the structure of
neural networks. Nonetheless, a significant hurdle is often overlooked: the
superposition of periodic signals does not necessarily result in a periodic
signal. For example, when forecasting almost periodic functions composed of
signals with incommensurate frequencies, traditional models such as
Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) frequently outperform most
neural networks including large language models (LLMs). To tackle this goal, we
propose Autoregressive-Weight-Enhanced AR-KAN, a hybrid model that combines the
benefits of both methods. Using the Universal Myopic Mapping Theorem, we apply
a Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) for the static nonlinear part and include
memory through a pre-trained AR component, which can be explained to retain the
most useful information while eliminating redundancy. Experimental data
indicates that AR-KAN delivers superior results on $72\%$ of real-world
datasets.

TL;DR: 提出了D-Byz-SGDM方法，通过延迟动量聚合机制解决联邦学习中部分参与场景下的拜占庭攻击问题，在理论和实验上都证明了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有拜占庭鲁棒联邦学习方法假设全客户端参与，但在实际通信约束和客户端可用性限制下，部分参与是更现实的场景。当采样客户端包含拜占庭多数时，现有方法会立即失效。

Method: 引入延迟动量聚合原则：服务器聚合来自非参与客户端的最新接收梯度，同时结合活跃客户端的即时动量。开发了D-Byz-SGDM优化器来实现这一原则。

Result: 建立了收敛保证，恢复了全参与结果并匹配了部分参与设置的下界。深度学习实验验证了理论发现，在各种拜占庭攻击下展现出稳定和鲁棒的训练性能。

Conclusion: D-Byz-SGDM方法成功解决了部分参与联邦学习中的拜占庭攻击挑战，提供了理论保证和实际有效性，为稀疏通信场景下的安全联邦学习提供了解决方案。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) allows distributed model training across multiple
clients while preserving data privacy, but it remains vulnerable to Byzantine
clients that exhibit malicious behavior. While existing Byzantine-robust FL
methods provide strong convergence guarantees (e.g., to a stationary point in
expectation) under Byzantine attacks, they typically assume full client
participation, which is unrealistic due to communication constraints and client
availability. Under partial participation, existing methods fail immediately
after the sampled clients contain a Byzantine majority, creating a fundamental
challenge for sparse communication. First, we introduce delayed momentum
aggregation, a novel principle where the server aggregates the most recently
received gradients from non-participating clients alongside fresh momentum from
active clients. Our optimizer D-Byz-SGDM (Delayed Byzantine-robust SGD with
Momentum) implements this delayed momentum aggregation principle for
Byzantine-robust FL with partial participation. Then, we establish convergence
guarantees that recover previous full participation results and match the
fundamental lower bounds we prove for the partial participation setting.
Experiments on deep learning tasks validated our theoretical findings, showing
stable and robust training under various Byzantine attacks.

Motivation: 解决Muon优化器正交化更新中学习率确定困难的问题，同时结合AdaGrad自适应方法的优势

Method: 将基于范数的AdaGrad型步长与正交化更新方向结合，仅需额外计算一个标量变量（累积梯度范数平方）

Result: 在非凸函数上建立了最优理论收敛率，在CIFAR-10分类和函数回归任务上实验表现优于Muon和Adam

Conclusion: AdaGO成功融合了正交化更新和自适应步长的优势，计算高效且性能优越

Abstract: The recently proposed Muon optimizer updates weight matrices via
orthogonalized momentum and has demonstrated strong empirical success in large
language model training. However, it remains unclear how to determine the
learning rates for such orthogonalized updates. AdaGrad, by contrast, is a
widely used adaptive method that scales stochastic gradients by accumulated
past gradients. We propose a new algorithm, AdaGO, which combines a norm-based
AdaGrad-type stepsize with an orthogonalized update direction, bringing
together the benefits of both approaches. Unlike other adaptive variants of
Muon, AdaGO preserves the orthogonality of the update direction, which can be
interpreted as a spectral descent direction, while adapting the stepsizes to
the optimization landscape by scaling the direction with accumulated past
gradient norms. The implementation of AdaGO requires only minimal modification
to Muon, with a single additional scalar variable, the accumulated squared
gradient norms, to be computed, making it computationally and memory efficient.
Optimal theoretical convergence rates are established for nonconvex functions
in both stochastic and deterministic settings under standard smoothness and
unbiased bounded-variance noise assumptions. Empirical results on CIFAR-10
classification and function regression demonstrate that AdaGO outperforms Muon
and Adam.

Abstract: Sleep staging models often degrade when deployed on patients with unseen
physiology or recording conditions. We propose a streaming, source-free
test-time adaptation (TTA) recipe that combines entropy minimization (Tent)
with Batch-Norm statistic refresh and two safety rails: an entropy gate to
pause adaptation on uncertain windows and an EMA-based reset to reel back
drift. On Sleep-EDF Expanded, using single-lead EEG (Fpz-Cz, 100 Hz, 30s
epochs; R&K to AASM mapping), we show consistent gains over a frozen baseline
at seconds-level latency and minimal memory, reporting per-stage metrics and
Cohen's k. The method is model-agnostic, requires no source data or patient
calibration, and is practical for on-device or bedside use.

Conclusion: 该多模态融合方法能够实现成本效益高的实时监控，在增材制造领域具有广泛的应用前景。

Abstract: While multiple sensors are used for real-time monitoring in additive
manufacturing, not all provide practical or reliable process insights. For
example, high-speed X-ray imaging offers valuable spatial information about
subsurface melt pool behavior but is costly and impractical for most industrial
settings. In contrast, absorptivity data from low-cost photodiodes correlate
with melt pool dynamics but is often too noisy for accurate prediction when
used alone. In this paper, we propose a multimodal data fusion approach for
predicting melt pool dynamics by combining high-fidelity X-ray data with
low-fidelity absorptivity data in the Laser Powder Bed Fusion (LPBF) process.
Our multimodal learning framework integrates convolutional neural networks
(CNNs) for spatial feature extraction from X-ray data with recurrent neural
networks (RNNs) for temporal feature extraction from absorptivity signals,
using an early fusion strategy. The multimodal model is further used as a
transfer learning model to fine-tune the RNN model that can predict melt pool
dynamics only with absorptivity, with greater accuracy compared to the
multimodal model. Results show that training with both modalities significantly
improves prediction accuracy compared to using either modality alone.
Furthermore, once trained, the model can infer melt pool characteristics using
only absorptivity data, eliminating the need for expensive X-ray imaging. This
multimodal fusion approach enables cost-effective, real-time monitoring and has
broad applicability in additive manufacturing.

Abstract: Mean Field Games (MFGs) offer a powerful framework for studying large-scale
multi-agent systems. Yet, learning Nash equilibria in MFGs remains a
challenging problem, particularly when the initial distribution is unknown or
when the population is subject to common noise. In this paper, we introduce an
efficient deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm designed to achieve
population-dependent Nash equilibria without relying on averaging or historical
sampling, inspired by Munchausen RL and Online Mirror Descent. The resulting
policy is adaptable to various initial distributions and sources of common
noise. Through numerical experiments on seven canonical examples, we
demonstrate that our algorithm exhibits superior convergence properties
compared to state-of-the-art algorithms, particularly a DRL version of
Fictitious Play for population-dependent policies. The performance in the
presence of common noise underscores the robustness and adaptability of our
approach.

TL;DR: 提出了一种针对大语言模型二值量化的新优化目标和三种算法，通过自适应分组策略动态识别最优非结构化子矩阵，在仅1.007位平均位长下保持高质量模型性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型需要大量内存和计算资源，二值量化可显著减少存储和推理成本，但传统二值量化相比4位量化存在明显性能下降

Method: 提出专门针对二值量化的优化目标，设计三种算法实现该目标，通过自适应分组策略增强分块量化，动态识别最优非结构化子矩阵

Result: 量化后的LLaMA 3.2 3B模型困惑度为8.23（原版7.81），显著优于之前SOTA BiLLM的123.90，与SOTA 4位方法GPTQ性能相当，压缩过程高效（单CPU核心14秒量化权重，全程100分钟内完成）

Conclusion: 该方法在极低平均位长（1.007位）下实现了接近原始模型的性能，在性能和效率上都与先进4位量化方法竞争，且具有高度并行性

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across
a wide range of Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, but require
substantial memory and computational resources. Binary quantization, which
compresses model weights from 16-bit Brain Float to 1-bit representations in
{-1, 1}, offers significant reductions in storage and inference costs. However,
such aggressive quantization often leads to notable performance degradation
compared to more conservative 4-bit quantization methods. In this research, we
propose a novel optimization objective tailored for binary quantization, along
with three algorithms designed to realize it effectively. Our method enhances
blocked quantization by dynamically identifying optimal unstructured
sub-matrices through adaptive grouping strategies. Experimental results
demonstrate that our approach achieves an average bit length of just 1.007
bits, while maintaining high model quality. Specifically, our quantized LLaMA
3.2 3B model attains a perplexity of 8.23, remarkably close to the original
7.81, and surpasses previous SOTA BiLLM with a perplexity of only 123.90.
Furthermore, our method is competitive with SOTA 4-bit approaches such as GPTQ
in both performance and efficiency. The compression process is highly
efficient, requiring only 14 seconds to quantize the full LLaMA 3.2 3B weights
on a single CPU core, with the entire process completing in under 100 minutes
and exhibiting embarrassingly parallel properties.

TL;DR: 通过扩展ReLU迁移图(RTG)框架，提出了一种图论模型来理解深度ReLU网络，证明了随机初始化时RTG具有强扩展性、二项度分布和谱性质，并通过区域熵和谱间隔等方法提供了新的容量和泛化界。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了通过离散函数几何的视角来分析ReLU网络，提供统一的框架来理解、诊断和改善网络的泛化能力。

Method: 扩展ReLU迁移图(RTG)框架，每个节点代表一个线性激活区域，边链接相差仅一个ReLU激活翻转的区域，形成离散几何结构。

Result: 证明随机初始化时RTG具有强扩展性、二项度分布和谱性质，区域熵在过参数化下饱和，谱间隔与泛化相关，相邻区域间的KL散度反映函数平滑性。

Conclusion: 该工作提供了通过离散函数几何分析ReLU网络的统一框架，为理解、诊断和改善网络泛化能力提供了新工具。

Abstract: We extend the ReLU Transition Graph (RTG) framework into a comprehensive
graph-theoretic model for understanding deep ReLU networks. In this model, each
node represents a linear activation region, and edges connect regions that
differ by a single ReLU activation flip, forming a discrete geometric structure
over the network's functional behavior. We prove that RTGs at random
initialization exhibit strong expansion, binomial degree distributions, and
spectral properties that tightly govern generalization. These structural
insights enable new bounds on capacity via region entropy and on generalization
via spectral gap and edge-wise KL divergence. Empirically, we construct RTGs
for small networks, measure their smoothness and connectivity properties, and
validate theoretical predictions. Our results show that region entropy
saturates under overparameterization, spectral gap correlates with
generalization, and KL divergence across adjacent regions reflects functional
smoothness. This work provides a unified framework for analyzing ReLU networks
through the lens of discrete functional geometry, offering new tools to
understand, diagnose, and improve generalization.

Motivation: 解决LLM在数学编程以外的理性领域中因缺乏验证数据集而无法有效应用RLVR方法的问题。

Method: 构建包含8,729个人工审核示例的12领域数据集(LoongBench)，以及支持多种提示策略的合成数据生成环境(LoongEnv)，通过代码执行验证答案来奖励CoT解决方案。

Conclusion: Loong框架为多领域理性能力的RLVR训练提供了可扩展的解决方案，通过合成数据生成和代码验证机制有效充实了训练数据。

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown that their
reasoning capabilities can be significantly improved through Reinforcement
Learning with Verifiable Reward (RLVR), particularly in domains like
mathematics and programming, where ground-truth correctness can be
automatically evaluated. However, extending this success to other
reasoning-intensive domains remains challenging due to the scarcity of
high-quality, verifiable datasets and the high cost of human supervision. In
this work, we introduce the Loong Project: an open-source framework for
scalable synthetic data generation and verification across a diverse range of
reasoning-intensive domains. The framework consists of two key components: (1)
LoongBench, a curated seed dataset containing 8,729 human-vetted examples
across 12 domains (e.g., Advanced Mathematics, Chemistry, Logic), each paired
with executable code and rich metadata; and (2) LoongEnv, a modular synthetic
data generation environment that supports multiple prompting strategies to
produce new question-answer-code triples. Together, these components form an
agent-environment loop that enables reinforcement learning, where an LLM-based
agent is rewarded for generating Chain-of-Thought (CoT) solutions that align
with code-executed answers. Empirically, we benchmark LoongBench on a broad
suite of both open-source and proprietary LLMs to evaluate domain coverage and
reveal performance bottlenecks. In addition, we conduct a comprehensive
analysis of synthetic data generated by LoongEnv, examining correctness,
difficulty, and diversity. Code and documentation are available at

Motivation: 解决SAM在分布式大批次训练中的效率低下问题，同时保持其泛化性能优势

Method: 将SAM的对抗性步骤与异步分布式采样策略相结合，生成平滑的锐度感知损失景观进行优化

Result: 消除了同步瓶颈，加速了大批次收敛，相比数据并行SAM获得了更高的最终准确率

Conclusion: LSAM成功地在保持SAM泛化优势的同时显著提升了分布式训练效率

Abstract: While Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) improves generalization in deep
neural networks by minimizing both loss and sharpness, it suffers from
inefficiency in distributed large-batch training. We present Landscape-Smoothed
SAM (LSAM), a novel optimizer that preserves SAM's generalization advantages
while offering superior efficiency. LSAM integrates SAM's adversarial steps
with an asynchronous distributed sampling strategy, generating an asynchronous
distributed sampling scheme, producing a smoothed sharpness-aware loss
landscape for optimization. This design eliminates synchronization bottlenecks,
accelerates large-batch convergence, and delivers higher final accuracy
compared to data-parallel SAM.

<details>

Motivation: 传统DRL交通信号控制存在两种主要范式：选择相位策略可能导致不可预测的相位序列影响驾驶员预期和安全，而切换策略可能导致相位分配不公平和效率低下

Method: 提出深度分层周期规划器(DHCP)，采用分层控制：高层代理根据整体交通状态确定南北和东西方向的总周期时间分配，低层代理在各主要方向内进一步为直行和左转运动分配更灵活的时长

Result: 在真实和合成路网以及多组真实和合成交通流上进行测试，实证结果显示该模型在所有数据集上均优于基线方法

Conclusion: DHCP模型通过分层周期时间分配机制，在保持相位序列可预测性的同时，实现了更公平和高效的交通信号控制

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has become a popular approach in traffic
signal control (TSC) due to its ability to learn adaptive policies from complex
traffic environments. Within DRL-based TSC methods, two primary control
paradigms are ``choose phase" and ``switch" strategies. Although the agent in
the choose phase paradigm selects the next active phase adaptively, this
paradigm may result in unexpected phase sequences for drivers, disrupting their
anticipation and potentially compromising safety at intersections. Meanwhile,
the switch paradigm allows the agent to decide whether to switch to the next
predefined phase or extend the current phase. While this structure maintains a
more predictable order, it can lead to unfair and inefficient phase
allocations, as certain movements may be extended disproportionately while
others are neglected. In this paper, we propose a DRL model, named Deep
Hierarchical Cycle Planner (DHCP), to allocate the traffic signal cycle
duration hierarchically. A high-level agent first determines the split of the
total cycle time between the North-South (NS) and East-West (EW) directions
based on the overall traffic state. Then, a low-level agent further divides the
allocated duration within each major direction between straight and left-turn
movements, enabling more flexible durations for the two movements. We test our
model on both real and synthetic road networks, along with multiple sets of
real and synthetic traffic flows. Empirical results show our model achieves the
best performance over all datasets against baselines.

Conclusion: AI驱动方法具有强大的自动化潜力、健壮的普适性和实时处理能力，特别适用于无标准物质或需要快速现场分析的场景

Abstract: Liquid scintillation triple-to-doubly coincident ratio (TDCR) spectroscopy is
widely adopted as a standard method for radionuclide quantification because of
its inherent advantages such as high precision, self-calibrating capability,
and independence from radioactive reference sources. However, multiradionuclide
analysis via TDCR faces the challenges of limited automation and reliance on
mixture-specific standards, which may not be easily available. Here, we present
an Artificial Intelligence (AI) framework that combines numerical spectral
simulation and deep learning for standard-free automated analysis. $\beta$
spectra for model training were generated using Geant4 simulations coupled with
statistically modeled detector response sampling. A tailored neural network
architecture, trained on this dataset covering various nuclei mix ratio and
quenching scenarios, enables autonomous resolution of individual radionuclide
activities and detecting efficiency through end-to-end learning paradigms. The
model delivers consistent high accuracy across tasks: activity proportions
(mean absolute error = 0.009), detection efficiencies (mean absolute error =
0.002), and spectral reconstruction (Structural Similarity Index = 0.9998),
validating its physical plausibility for quenched $\beta$ spectroscopy. This
AI-driven methodology exhibits significant potential for automated
safety-compliant multiradionuclide analysis with robust generalization,
real-time processing capabilities, and engineering feasibility, particularly in
scenarios where reference materials are unavailable or rapid field analysis is
required.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在自动驾驶等安全关键应用中，可解释AI(XAI)对于验证和信任模型至关重要，但Rashomon效应（多个同等准确模型对相同预测提供不同解释）挑战了XAI的可靠性。

Method: 使用定性可解释图(QXGs)作为符号场景表示，训练两类不同模型的Rashomon集合：可解释的基于对的梯度提升模型和复杂的基于图的图神经网络(GNNs)，并通过特征归因方法测量解释的一致性。

Result: 结果显示存在显著的解释不一致性，不同模型类别内部和之间的解释都存在分歧。

Conclusion: 解释歧义是问题的固有属性，而不仅仅是建模伪影，这对安全关键应用中的模型验证和信任提出了重要挑战。

Abstract: Explainable AI (XAI) is essential for validating and trusting models in
safety-critical applications like autonomous driving. However, the reliability
of XAI is challenged by the Rashomon effect, where multiple, equally accurate
models can offer divergent explanations for the same prediction. This paper
provides the first empirical quantification of this effect for the task of
action prediction in real-world driving scenes. Using Qualitative Explainable
Graphs (QXGs) as a symbolic scene representation, we train Rashomon sets of two
distinct model classes: interpretable, pair-based gradient boosting models and
complex, graph-based Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). Using feature attribution
methods, we measure the agreement of explanations both within and between these
classes. Our results reveal significant explanation disagreement. Our findings
suggest that explanation ambiguity is an inherent property of the problem, not
just a modeling artifact.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前归因方法评估存在阈值选择偏差，单一阈值选择可以改变方法排名超过200个百分点，这削弱了评估结论的可靠性。

Method: 采用无阈值框架计算IoU曲线下面积(AUC-IoU)，捕捉归因质量在整个阈值范围内的表现，避免单一阈值选择的偏差。

Result: 在皮肤镜图像上评估7种归因方法，显示单一阈值指标产生矛盾结果，而无阈值评估提供可靠区分。XRAI比LIME提升31%，比普通积分梯度提升204%，不同病灶尺度的性能差异达269%。

Conclusion: 该无阈值框架建立了消除评估伪影的方法学标准，为医学影像及其他领域的归因方法选择提供理论洞察和实用指导。

Abstract: Attribution methods explain neural network predictions by identifying
influential input features, but their evaluation suffers from threshold
selection bias that can reverse method rankings and undermine conclusions.
Current protocols binarize attribution maps at single thresholds, where
threshold choice alone can alter rankings by over 200 percentage points. We
address this flaw with a threshold-free framework that computes Area Under the
Curve for Intersection over Union (AUC-IoU), capturing attribution quality
across the full threshold spectrum. Evaluating seven attribution methods on
dermatological imaging, we show single-threshold metrics yield contradictory
results, while threshold-free evaluation provides reliable differentiation.
XRAI achieves 31% improvement over LIME and 204% over vanilla Integrated
Gradients, with size-stratified analysis revealing performance variations up to
269% across lesion scales. These findings establish methodological standards
that eliminate evaluation artifacts and enable evidence-based method selection.
The threshold-free framework provides both theoretical insight into attribution
behavior and practical guidance for robust comparison in medical imaging and
beyond.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel application of the Tabular Prior-Data Fitted
Network (TabPFN) - a transformer-based foundation model for tabular data - to
geotechnical site characterization problems defined in the GEOAI benchmark
BM/AirportSoilProperties/2/2025. Two tasks are addressed: (1) predicting the
spatial variation of undrained shear strength (su) across borehole depth
profiles, and (2) imputing missing mechanical parameters in a dense-site
dataset. We apply TabPFN in a zero-training, few-shot, in-context learning
setting - without hyper-parameter tuning - and provide it with additional
context from the big indirect database (BID). The study demonstrates that
TabPFN, as a general-purpose foundation model, achieved superior accuracy and
well-calibrated predictive distributions compared to a conventional
hierarchical Bayesian model (HBM) baseline, while also offering significant
gains in inference efficiency. In Benchmark Problem #1 (spatial su prediction),
TabPFN outperformed the HBM in prediction accuracy and delivered an
order-of-magnitude faster runtime. In Benchmark Problem #2 (missing mechanical
parameter imputation), TabPFN likewise achieved lower RMSE for all target
parameters with well-quantified uncertainties, though its cumulative
computation cost was higher than HBM's due to its one-variable-at-a-time
inference. These results mark the first successful use of a tabular foundation
model in geotechnical modeling, suggesting a potential paradigm shift in
probabilistic site characterization.

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Decision trees have been studied extensively in the context of fairness,
aiming to maximize prediction performance while ensuring non-discrimination
against different groups. Techniques in this space usually focus on imposing
constraints at training time, constraining the search space so that solutions
which display unacceptable values of relevant metrics are not considered,
discarded, or discouraged. If we assume one target variable y and one sensitive
attribute s, the design space of tree learning algorithms can be spanned as
follows: (i) One can have one tree T that is built using an objective function
that is a function of y, s, and T. For instance, one can build a tree based on
the weighted information gain regarding y (maximizing) and s (minimizing). (ii)
The second option is to have one tree model T that uses an objective function
in y and T and a constraint on s and T. Here, s is no longer part of the
objective, but part of a constraint. This can be achieved greedily by aborting
a further split as soon as the condition that optimizes the objective in y
fails to satisfy the constraint on s. A simple way to explore other splits is
to backtrack during tree construction once a fairness constraint is violated.
(iii) The third option is to have two trees T_y and T_s, one for y and one for
s, such that the tree structure for y and s does not have to be shared. In this
way, information regarding y and regarding s can be used independently, without
having to constrain the choices in tree construction by the mutual information
between the two variables. Quite surprisingly, of the three options, only the
first one and the greedy variant of the second have been studied in the
literature so far. In this paper, we introduce the above two additional options
from that design space and characterize them experimentally on multiple
datasets.

Conclusion: 该模型在各种挑战性环境中表现出优越性能，通过从成功和失败中学习的方法有效解决了自我模仿学习的局限性。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning faces significant challenges when applied to tasks
characterized by sparse reward structures. Although imitation learning, within
the domain of supervised learning, offers faster convergence, it relies heavily
on human-generated demonstrations. Recently, Goal-Conditioned Supervised
Learning (GCSL) has emerged as a potential solution by enabling self-imitation
learning for autonomous systems. By strategically relabelling goals, agents can
derive policy insights from their own experiences. Despite the successes of
this framework, it presents two notable limitations: (1) Learning exclusively
from self-generated experiences can exacerbate the agents' inherent biases; (2)
The relabelling strategy allows agents to focus solely on successful outcomes,
precluding them from learning from their mistakes. To address these issues, we
propose a novel model that integrates contrastive learning principles into the
GCSL framework to learn from both success and failure. Through empirical
evaluations, we demonstrate that our algorithm overcomes limitations imposed by
agents' initial biases and thereby enables more exploratory behavior. This
facilitates the identification and adoption of effective policies, leading to
superior performance across a variety of challenging environments.

Motivation: 解决现有LoRA风格适配器在高秩表达性和参数效率之间的权衡问题，高秩方法需要更多参数，而向量化方法虽然参数效率高但表达能力有限

Method: 使用Tucker-like张量网络参数化权重更新矩阵，冻结大型随机初始化因子并在层间共享，仅训练由对角因子矩阵条目组成的小型层特定缩放向量

Result: TeRA在性能上匹配甚至超越高秩适配器，同时所需的可训练参数数量与向量化方法相当

Conclusion: TeRA成功实现了高秩权重更新与参数效率的平衡，理论分析和消融研究验证了方法的有效性

Abstract: Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods, such as Low-Rank Adaptation
(LoRA), have significantly reduced the number of trainable parameters needed in
fine-tuning large language models (LLMs). Subsequent developments of LoRA-style
adapters have diverged into two main directions: (1) enhancing model
expressivity with high-rank adapters, and (2) pushing for further parameter
reduction, as exemplified by vector-based methods. However, these approaches
present a trade-off, as achieving the expressivity of high-rank weight updates
typically comes at the cost of sacrificing the extreme parameter efficiency
offered by vector-based techniques. To address this issue, we propose a
vector-based random \underline{\textbf{Te}}nsor network for
high-\underline{\textbf{R}}ank \underline{\textbf{A}}daptation (TeRA), a novel
PEFT method that achieves high-rank weight updates while retaining the
parameter efficiency of vector-based PEFT adapters. This is achieved by
parameterizing the tensorized weight update matrix as a Tucker-like tensor
network (TN), in which large randomly initialized factors are frozen and shared
across layers, while only small layer-specific scaling vectors, formed by
entries in diagonal factor matrices, are trained. This design effectively
decouples the rank of the weight update matrix from the number of trainable
parameters. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that TeRA matches or even
outperforms high-rank adapters, while requiring a trainable parameter count
similar to vector-based methods. Theoretical analysis and ablation studies
further validate the effectiveness of our approach.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在可穿戴设备压力监测等应用中，地面实况通常被标注为单点事件，但实际现象是渐进的且时间上分散的。标准指标如F1和点调整F1(F1_pa)在这种真实世界不平衡数据集中经常错误地表示模型性能。

Method: 引入窗口F1指标(F1_w)，该指标包含时间容差，允许在精确对齐不现实的情况下进行更稳健的事件检测评估。在三个生理数据集(两个野外数据集ADARP、Wrist Angel和一个实验数据集ROAD)上进行实证分析。

Result: F1_w揭示了传统指标无法发现的模型性能有意义的模式，其窗口大小可以根据领域知识进行调整以避免高估。使用TimesFM的预测结果显示，只有时间容差指标在野外用例中显示出相对于随机和零基线的统计显著改进。

Conclusion: 这项工作解决了时间序列评估中的关键差距，并为医疗保健应用提供了实用指导，其中对时间精度的要求因上下文而异。评估指标的选择强烈影响模型性能的解释。

Abstract: Accurate evaluation of event detection in time series is essential for
applications such as stress monitoring with wearable devices, where ground
truth is typically annotated as single-point events, even though the underlying
phenomena are gradual and temporally diffused. Standard metrics like F1 and
point-adjusted F1 (F1$_{pa}$) often misrepresent model performance in such
real-world, imbalanced datasets. We introduce a window-based F1 metric (F1$_w$)
that incorporates temporal tolerance, enabling a more robust assessment of
event detection when exact alignment is unrealistic. Empirical analysis in
three physiological datasets, two in-the-wild (ADARP, Wrist Angel) and one
experimental (ROAD), indicates that F1$_w$ reveals meaningful model performance
patterns invisible to conventional metrics, while its window size can be
adapted to domain knowledge to avoid overestimation. We show that the choice of
evaluation metric strongly influences the interpretation of model performance:
using predictions from TimesFM, only our temporally tolerant metrics reveal
statistically significant improvements over random and null baselines in the
two in-the-wild use cases. This work addresses key gaps in time series
evaluation and provides practical guidance for healthcare applications where
requirements for temporal precision vary by context.

Abstract: The increasing demand for high data rates and seamless connectivity in
wireless systems has sparked significant interest in reconfigurable intelligent
surfaces (RIS) and artificial intelligence-based wireless applications. RIS
typically comprises passive reflective antenna elements that control the
wireless propagation environment by adequately tuning the phase of the
reflective elements. The allocation of RIS elements to multipleuser equipment
(UEs) is crucial for efficiently utilizing RIS. In this work, we formulate a
joint optimization problem that optimizes the RIS phase configuration and
resource allocation under an $\alpha$-fair scheduling framework and propose an
efficient way of allocating RIS elements. Conventional iterative optimization
methods, however, suffer from exponentially increasing computational complexity
as the number of RIS elements increases and also complicate the generation of
training labels for supervised learning. To overcome these challenges, we
propose a five-layer fully connected neural network (FNN) combined with a
preprocessing technique to significantly reduce input dimensionality, lower
computational complexity, and enhance scalability. The simulation results show
that our proposed NN-based solution reduces computational overhead while
significantly improving system throughput by 6.8% compared to existing RIS
element allocation schemes. Furthermore, the proposed system achieves better
performance while reducing computational complexity, making it significantly
more scalable than the iterative optimization algorithms.

*Gianmarco De Vita,Nargiz Humbatova,Paolo Tonella*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TopoMap是一种黑盒、模型无关的方法，通过降维和聚类创建输入特征空间的拓扑图，自动选择最优配置来识别可区分的故障特征区域，在变异测试中显著优于随机选择。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习测试方法可能只关注特定故障特征而忽略其他特征区域，需要一种系统性的方法来对输入特征空间进行分组和映射。

Method: 使用降维获得输入嵌入，然后进行聚类，通过训练DNN作为人工评估器自动选择最优的嵌入/聚类配置来生成拓扑图。

Result: TopoMap生成的拓扑图包含可区分且有意义的区域，在变异测试中比随机选择平均高出35%（可杀死变异体）和61%（不可杀死变异体）。

Conclusion: TopoMap提供了一种有效的方法来系统性地映射深度学习模型的输入特征空间，能够识别不同的故障特征区域，在测试用例选择方面表现出色。

Abstract: Testing Deep Learning (DL)-based systems is an open challenge. Although it is
relatively easy to find inputs that cause a DL model to misbehave, the grouping
of inputs by features that make the DL model under test fail is largely
unexplored. Existing approaches for DL testing introduce perturbations that may
focus on specific failure-inducing features, while neglecting others that
belong to different regions of the feature space. In this paper, we create an
explicit topographical map of the input feature space. Our approach, named
TopoMap, is both black-box and model-agnostic as it relies solely on features
that characterise the input space. To discriminate the inputs according to the
specific features they share, we first apply dimensionality reduction to obtain
input embeddings, which are then subjected to clustering. Each DL model might
require specific embedding computations and clustering algorithms to achieve a
meaningful separation of inputs into discriminative groups. We propose a novel
way to evaluate alternative configurations of embedding and clustering
techniques. We used a deep neural network (DNN) as an approximation of a human
evaluator who could tell whether a pair of clusters can be discriminated based
on the features of the included elements. We use such a DNN to automatically
select the optimal topographical map of the inputs among all those that are
produced by different embedding/clustering configurations. The evaluation
results show that the maps generated by TopoMap consist of distinguishable and
meaningful regions. In addition, we evaluate the effectiveness of TopoMap using
mutation analysis. In particular, we assess whether the clusters in our
topographical map allow for an effective selection of mutation-killing inputs.
Experimental results show that our approach outperforms random selection by 35%
on average on killable mutants; by 61% on non-killable ones.

Result: 在合成基准和实际应用中表现出优越的泛化能力和竞争力性能

Conclusion: FoMEMO方法为昂贵多目标优化提供了新的范式，通过合成数据预训练的基础模型能够有效适应未知问题

Abstract: Expensive multi-objective optimization is a prevalent and crucial concern in
many real-world scenarios, where sample-efficiency is vital due to the limited
evaluations to recover the true Pareto front for decision making. Existing
works either involve rebuilding Gaussian process surrogates from scratch for
each objective in each new problem encountered, or rely on extensive past
domain experiments for pre-training deep learning models, making them hard to
generalize and impractical to cope with various emerging applications in the
real world. To address this issue, we propose a new paradigm named FoMEMO
(Foundation Models for Expensive Multi-objective Optimization), which enables
the establishment of a foundation model conditioned on any domain trajectory
and user preference, and facilitates fast in-context optimization based on the
predicted preference-wise aggregation posteriors. Rather than accessing
extensive domain experiments in the real world, we demonstrate that
pre-training the foundation model with a diverse set of hundreds of millions of
synthetic data can lead to superior adaptability to unknown problems, without
necessitating any subsequent model training or updates in the optimization
process. We evaluate our method across a variety of synthetic benchmarks and
real-word applications, and demonstrate its superior generality and competitive
performance compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: 结构转移是一个通用的表示转换演算方法，可在广泛的实际场景中识别替代表示，为表示选择提供了理论基础和实用工具。

Abstract: Representation choice is of fundamental importance to our ability to
communicate and reason effectively. A major unsolved problem, addressed in this
paper, is how to devise \textit{representational-system (RS) agnostic}
techniques that drive representation transformation and choice. We present a
novel calculus, called \textit{structure transfer}, that enables representation
transformation across diverse RSs. Specifically, given a \textit{source}
representation drawn from a source RS, the rules of structure transfer allow us
to generate a \textit{target} representation for a target RS. The generality of
structure transfer comes in part from its ability to ensure that the source
representation and the generated target representation satisfy \textit{any}
specified relation (such as semantic equivalence). This is done by exploiting
\textit{schemas}, which encode knowledge about RSs. Specifically, schemas can
express \textit{preservation of information} across relations between any pair
of RSs, and this knowledge is used by structure transfer to derive a structure
for the target representation which ensures that the desired relation holds. We
formalise this using Representational Systems Theory~\cite{raggi2022rst},
building on the key concept of a \textit{construction space}. The abstract
nature of construction spaces grants them the generality to model RSs of
diverse kinds, including formal languages, geometric figures and diagrams, as
well as informal notations. Consequently, structure transfer is a
system-agnostic calculus that can be used to identify alternative
representations in a wide range of practical settings.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: HyPV-LEAD是一个用于加密货币异常交易检测的早期预警框架，通过窗口-时间范围建模、峰值-谷值采样和双曲嵌入技术，实现了高精度的主动异常检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 加密货币异常交易（如混币服务、欺诈转账和拉高出货）对金融完整性构成日益严重的风险，但由于类别不平衡、时间波动性和复杂网络依赖关系，检测异常交易仍然非常困难。现有方法主要是模型中心化和事后检测，只能在异常发生后进行标记，预防价值有限。

Method: HyPV-LEAD框架集成了三项创新技术：(1)窗口-时间范围建模确保可操作的提前预警；(2)峰值-谷值采样缓解类别不平衡同时保持时间连续性；(3)双曲嵌入捕捉区块链交易网络的层次结构和无标度特性。

Result: 在大规模比特币交易数据上的实证评估表明，HyPV-LEAD始终优于最先进的基线方法，实现了0.9624的PR-AUC，在精确率和召回率方面都有显著提升。消融研究进一步证实每个组件都提供互补的益处。

Conclusion: 通过将异常检测从反应式分类转变为主动式早期预警，HyPV-LEAD为实时风险管理、反洗钱合规和动态区块链环境中的金融安全建立了坚实基础。

Abstract: Abnormal cryptocurrency transactions - such as mixing services, fraudulent
transfers, and pump-and-dump operations -- pose escalating risks to financial
integrity but remain notoriously difficult to detect due to class imbalance,
temporal volatility, and complex network dependencies. Existing approaches are
predominantly model-centric and post hoc, flagging anomalies only after they
occur and thus offering limited preventive value. This paper introduces
HyPV-LEAD (Hyperbolic Peak-Valley Lead-time Enabled Anomaly Detection), a
data-driven early-warning framework that explicitly incorporates lead time into
anomaly detection. Unlike prior methods, HyPV-LEAD integrates three
innovations: (1) window-horizon modeling to guarantee actionable lead-time
alerts, (2) Peak-Valley (PV) sampling to mitigate class imbalance while
preserving temporal continuity, and (3) hyperbolic embedding to capture the
hierarchical and scale-free properties of blockchain transaction networks.
Empirical evaluation on large-scale Bitcoin transaction data demonstrates that
HyPV-LEAD consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving a
PR-AUC of 0.9624 with significant gains in precision and recall. Ablation
studies further confirm that each component - PV sampling, hyperbolic
embedding, and structural-temporal modeling - provides complementary benefits,
with the full framework delivering the highest performance. By shifting anomaly
detection from reactive classification to proactive early-warning, HyPV-LEAD
establishes a robust foundation for real-time risk management, anti-money
laundering (AML) compliance, and financial security in dynamic blockchain
environments.

Abstract: Missing data represents a fundamental challenge in machine learning
applications, often reducing model performance and reliability. This problem is
particularly acute in fields like bioinformatics and clinical machine learning,
where datasets are frequently incomplete due to the nature of both data
generation and data collection. While numerous imputation methods exist, from
simple statistical techniques to advanced deep learning models, no single
method consistently performs well across diverse datasets and missingness
mechanisms. This paper proposes a novel Meta-Imputation approach that learns to
combine the outputs of multiple base imputers to predict missing values more
accurately. By training the proposed method called Meta-Imputation Balanced
(MIB) on synthetically masked data with known ground truth, the system learns
to predict the most suitable imputed value based on the behavior of each
method. Our work highlights the potential of ensemble learning in imputation
and paves the way for more robust, modular, and interpretable preprocessing
pipelines in real-world machine learning systems.

<details>

Motivation: 非线性动力系统中的分岔现象会产生多个共存稳定解，但确定性机器学习模型难以捕捉这种多重性，往往对解进行平均而无法表示低对称性结果。

Method: 基于流匹配的生成框架，引入对称匹配策略，在群作用下对齐预测和目标输出，实现等变设置下的准确学习。

Result: 在从玩具模型到复杂物理问题（如屈曲梁和Allen-Cahn方程）的一系列系统中验证，流匹配在捕捉多模态分布和对称破缺分岔方面显著优于非概率和变分方法。

Conclusion: 为高维系统中的多稳态建模提供了原则性和可扩展的解决方案，能够准确捕捉分岔现象中的多重稳定解。

Abstract: Bifurcation phenomena in nonlinear dynamical systems often lead to multiple
coexisting stable solutions, particularly in the presence of symmetry breaking.
Deterministic machine learning models struggle to capture this multiplicity,
averaging over solutions and failing to represent lower-symmetry outcomes. In
this work, we propose a generative framework based on flow matching to model
the full probability distribution over bifurcation outcomes. Our method enables
direct sampling of multiple valid solutions while preserving system symmetries
through equivariant modeling. We introduce a symmetric matching strategy that
aligns predicted and target outputs under group actions, allowing accurate
learning in equivariant settings. We validate our approach on a range of
systems, from toy models to complex physical problems such as buckling beams
and the Allen-Cahn equation. Our results demonstrate that flow matching
significantly outperforms non-probabilistic and variational methods in
capturing multimodal distributions and symmetry-breaking bifurcations, offering
a principled and scalable solution for modeling multistability in
high-dimensional systems.

Motivation: 固定时间交通信号控制依赖手工公式和人工调整，劳动强度大且在异构或拥堵条件下效果不佳，需要自动化算法设计方法。

Method: 将问题表述为程序合成，候选算法表示为具有固定输入输出结构的Python函数，通过外部评估（交通模拟器）和进化搜索进行迭代优化。

Conclusion: 这项工作通过利用AI进行交通信号控制算法设计，开辟了新的研究方向，将程序合成与交通工程相结合。

Abstract: In traffic engineering, the fixed-time traffic signal control remains widely
used for its low cost, stability, and interpretability. However, its design
depends on hand-crafted formulas (e.g., Webster) and manual re-timing by
engineers to adapt to demand changes, which is labor-intensive and often yields
suboptimal results under heterogeneous or congested conditions. This paper
introduces the EvolveSignal, a large language models (LLMs) powered coding
agent to automatically discover new traffic signal control algorithms. We
formulate the problem as program synthesis, where candidate algorithms are
represented as Python functions with fixed input-output structures, and
iteratively optimized through external evaluations (e.g., a traffic simulator)
and evolutionary search. Experiments on a signalized intersection demonstrate
that the discovered algorithms outperform Webster's baseline, reducing average
delay by 20.1% and average stops by 47.1%. Beyond performance, ablation and
incremental analyses reveal that EvolveSignal modifications-such as adjusting
cycle length bounds, incorporating right-turn demand, and rescaling green
allocations-can offer practically meaningful insights for traffic engineers.
This work opens a new research direction by leveraging AI for algorithm design
in traffic signal control, bridging program synthesis with transportation
engineering.

Method: 通过基于稳定性的理论分析和标准化的MIA流程进行实证研究，评估不同数据集和隐私预算下的隐私泄露情况

Result: 研究结果显示GANs在抵抗成员推理攻击方面表现出显著的隐私鲁棒性优势，即使在强差分隐私机制下，模型类型本身也能显著影响隐私泄露程度

Conclusion: GANs相比扩散模型在差分隐私条件下具有更好的隐私保护性能，模型选择对隐私泄露风险具有关键影响

Abstract: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and diffusion models have emerged as
leading approaches for high-quality image synthesis. While both can be trained
under differential privacy (DP) to protect sensitive data, their sensitivity to
membership inference attacks (MIAs), a key threat to data confidentiality,
remains poorly understood. In this work, we present the first unified
theoretical and empirical analysis of the privacy risks faced by differentially
private generative models. We begin by showing, through a stability-based
analysis, that GANs exhibit fundamentally lower sensitivity to data
perturbations than diffusion models, suggesting a structural advantage in
resisting MIAs. We then validate this insight with a comprehensive empirical
study using a standardized MIA pipeline to evaluate privacy leakage across
datasets and privacy budgets. Our results consistently reveal a marked privacy
robustness gap in favor of GANs, even in strong DP regimes, highlighting that
model type alone can critically shape privacy leakage.

Conclusion: 这种生成式与预测式模型结合的方法仅使用一级氨基酸序列，无需几何框架或手工特征工程，有望实现更快、更经济高效的表位生成和筛选，推动新生物技术发展。

Abstract: Epitopes are short antigenic peptide sequences which are recognized by
antibodies or immune cell receptors. These are central to the development of
immunotherapies, vaccines, and diagnostics. However, the rational design of
synthetic epitope libraries is challenging due to the large combinatorial
sequence space, $20^n$ combinations for linear epitopes of n amino acids,
making screening and testing unfeasible, even with high throughput experimental
techniques. In this study, we present a large language model, epiGPTope,
pre-trained on protein data and specifically fine-tuned on linear epitopes,
which for the first time can directly generate novel epitope-like sequences,
which are found to possess statistical properties analogous to the ones of
known epitopes. This generative approach can be used to prepare libraries of
epitope candidate sequences. We further train statistical classifiers to
predict whether an epitope sequence is of bacterial or viral origin, thus
narrowing the candidate library and increasing the likelihood of identifying
specific epitopes. We propose that such combination of generative and
predictive models can be of assistance in epitope discovery. The approach uses
only primary amino acid sequences of linear epitopes, bypassing the need for a
geometric framework or hand-crafted features of the sequences. By developing a
method to create biologically feasible sequences, we anticipate faster and more
cost-effective generation and screening of synthetic epitopes, with relevant
applications in the development of new biotechnologies.

Abstract: Resource allocation is crucial for the performance optimization of

leading to inefficient and unfair resource distribution. To address this, we
open-sourced Fair-Synergy, an algorithmic framework that utilizes the concave
relationship between the agents' accuracy and the system resources to ensure
fair resource allocation across fleet intelligence. We extend traditional
allocation approaches to encompass a multidimensional machine learning utility
landscape defined by model parameters, training data volume, and task
complexity. We evaluate Fair-Synergy with advanced vision and language models
such as BERT, VGG16, MobileNet, and ResNets on datasets including MNIST,
CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, BDD, and GLUE. We demonstrate that Fair-Synergy
outperforms standard benchmarks by up to 25% in multi-agent inference and 11%
in multi-agent learning settings. Also, we explore how the level of fairness
affects the least advantaged, most advantaged, and average agents, providing

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RLVR中的结果奖励模型(ORM)过于粗粒度，无法区分正确答案中的错误推理或错误答案中的有效推理，而过程奖励模型(PRM)虽然提供细粒度指导但存在不准确性和奖励攻击问题。

Method: 提出PROF方法，通过一致性驱动的样本选择来协调PRM和ORM的互补优势，保留具有较高平均过程值的正确响应和较低平均过程值的错误响应，同时保持正负训练样本平衡。

Result: 实验表明该方法相比混合方法持续提高最终准确率超过4%，同时增强了中间推理步骤的质量。

Conclusion: PROF通过有效的数据处理策略成功解决了RLVR中奖励模型的粒度不匹配问题，在数学推理任务中取得了显著改进。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has emerged to be a
predominant paradigm for mathematical reasoning tasks, offering stable
improvements in reasoning ability. However, Outcome Reward Models (ORMs) in
RLVR are too coarse-grained to distinguish flawed reasoning within correct
answers or valid reasoning within incorrect answers. This lack of granularity
introduces noisy and misleading gradients significantly and hinders further
progress in reasoning process quality. While Process Reward Models (PRMs) offer
fine-grained guidance for intermediate steps, they frequently suffer from
inaccuracies and are susceptible to reward hacking.
  To resolve this dilemma, we introduce PRocess cOnsistency Filter (PROF), an
effective data process curation method that harmonizes noisy, fine-grained
process rewards with accurate, coarse-grained outcome rewards. Rather than
naively blending PRM and ORM in the objective function
(arXiv:archive/2506.18896), PROF leverages their complementary strengths
through consistency-driven sample selection. Our approach retains correct
responses with higher averaged process values and incorrect responses with
lower averaged process values, while maintaining positive/negative training
sample balance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method not only
consistently improves the final accuracy over $4\%$ compared to the blending
approaches, but also strengthens the quality of intermediate reasoning steps.

Motivation: 探索夏令时制（DST）实施对不同国家睡眠时长的影响，以及纬度在这一关系中的调节作用

Method: 采集61个国家的睡眠数据，进行统计相关分析，按照DST实施情况分组，并通过可视化比较不同组别的睡眠模式

Result: DST实施国家平均睡眠时长更长，但纬度产生显著调节作用：低纬度地区DST国家睡眠更短，高纬度地区DST国家睡眠更长

Conclusion: 夏令时制对睡眠的影响受到地理位置的调节，纬度是重要的调节因素

Abstract: In this study we analyzed average sleep durations across 61 countries to
examine the impact of Daylight Saving Time (DST) practices. Key metrics
influencing sleep were identified, and statistical correlation analysis was
applied to explore relationships among these factors. Countries were grouped
based on DST observance, and visualizations compared sleep patterns between DST
and non-DST regions. Results show that, on average, countries observing DST
tend to report longer sleep durations than those that do not. A more detailed
pattern emerged when accounting for latitude: at lower latitudes, DST-observing
countries reported shorter sleep durations compared to non-DST countries, while
at higher latitudes, DST-observing countries reported longer average sleep
durations. These findings suggest that the influence of DST on sleep may be
moderated by geographical location.

TL;DR: DP-SGD中的量化会导致比普通SGD更严重的精度下降，QPQuant通过动态层选择和损失感知优先级来减少量化方差，在保持差分隐私的同时实现更好的精度-计算权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在差分隐私SGD训练中使用量化技术时，发现噪声注入会放大量化方差，导致比普通SGD更严重的精度下降，需要解决这一挑战。

Method: 提出QPQuant动态量化框架：1）概率性层采样轮换量化层；2）使用差分隐私损失敏感度估计器进行损失感知层优先级排序，选择对模型质量影响最小的层进行量化。

Result: 在ResNet18、ResNet50和DenseNet121上的实验表明，QPQuant优于静态量化基线，实现接近帕累托最优的精度-计算权衡，理论吞吐量提升达2.21倍，验证精度下降小于2%。

Conclusion: QPQuant有效解决了DP-SGD中量化导致的精度下降问题，通过动态量化策略在保持隐私保护的同时显著提升了训练效率和性能。

Abstract: Differentially-Private SGD (DP-SGD) is a powerful technique to protect user
privacy when using sensitive data to train neural networks. During training,
converting model weights and activations into low-precision formats, i.e.,
quantization, can drastically reduce training times, energy consumption, and
cost, and is thus a widely used technique. In this work, we demonstrate that
quantization causes significantly higher accuracy degradation in DP-SGD
compared to regular SGD. We observe that this is caused by noise injection in
DP-SGD, which amplifies quantization variance, leading to disproportionately
large accuracy degradation. To address this challenge, we present QPQuant, a
dynamic quantization framework that adaptively selects a changing subset of
layers to quantize at each epoch. Our method combines two key ideas that
effectively reduce quantization variance: (i) probabilistic sampling of the
layers that rotates which layers are quantized every epoch, and (ii) loss-aware
layer prioritization, which uses a differentially private loss sensitivity
estimator to identify layers that can be quantized with minimal impact on model
quality. This estimator consumes a negligible fraction of the overall privacy
budget, preserving DP guarantees. Empirical evaluations on ResNet18, ResNet50,
and DenseNet121 across a range of datasets demonstrate that DPQuant
consistently outperforms static quantization baselines, achieving near
Pareto-optimal accuracy-compute trade-offs and up to 2.21x theoretical
throughput improvements on low-precision hardware, with less than 2% drop in
validation accuracy.

TL;DR: 该论文将似然函数校准从二元假设扩展到多元假设情况，使用Aitchison几何和等距对数比变换来推广对数似然比和权重证据概念，并保持校准性、幂等性和分布约束等性质。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统概率预测校准研究广泛，但似然函数校准主要局限于二元假设情况。需要将校准概念扩展到多元假设场景，以提升多分类问题的可解释性和可靠性。

Method: 使用Aitchison单纯形几何和等距对数比(ILR)变换，将二元情况下的对数似然比(LLR)和权重证据概念推广到多元假设。恢复贝叶斯规则的向量形式加法结构，并扩展校准定义、幂等性和分布约束。

Result: 成功将似然函数校准的理论框架从二元扩展到多元假设，提出了多分类对应的ILR变换似然函数。在机器学习应用中展示了非线性判别分析，判别分量形成了跨类别的校准似然函数。

Conclusion: 这项工作主要是概念性的，但为多分类问题提供了校准似然函数的理论基础，提高了方法的可解释性和可靠性，为后续在多假设场景下的统计推断和机器学习应用奠定了基础。

Abstract: While calibration of probabilistic predictions has been widely studied, this
paper rather addresses calibration of likelihood functions. This has been
discussed, especially in biometrics, in cases with only two exhaustive and
mutually exclusive hypotheses (classes) where likelihood functions can be
written as log-likelihood-ratios (LLRs). After defining calibration for LLRs
and its connection with the concept of weight-of-evidence, we present the
idempotence property and its associated constraint on the distribution of the
LLRs. Although these results have been known for decades, they have been
limited to the binary case. Here, we extend them to cases with more than two
hypotheses by using the Aitchison geometry of the simplex, which allows us to
recover, in a vector form, the additive form of the Bayes' rule; extending
therefore the LLR and the weight-of-evidence to any number of hypotheses.
Especially, we extend the definition of calibration, the idempotence, and the
constraint on the distribution of likelihood functions to this multiple
hypotheses and multiclass counterpart of the LLR: the isometric-log-ratio
transformed likelihood function. This work is mainly conceptual, but we still
provide one application to machine learning by presenting a non-linear
discriminant analysis where the discriminant components form a calibrated
likelihood function over the classes, improving therefore the interpretability
and the reliability of the method.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Robult是一个可扩展的多模态学习框架，通过信息论方法解决缺失模态和标注数据有限的问题，使用PU对比损失和潜在重构损失来保持模态特异性信息并利用冗余性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多模态学习中缺失模态和有限标注数据的关键挑战，提升模型的鲁棒性和实用性。

Method: 提出软正未标注(PU)对比损失最大化任务相关特征对齐，以及潜在重构损失确保保留独特模态特异性信息，采用模块化设计。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验表明，Robult在半监督学习和缺失模态场景下均优于现有方法，性能优越。

Conclusion: Robult框架轻量可扩展，能无缝集成到现有架构中，适用于实际多模态应用场景。

Abstract: Addressing missing modalities and limited labeled data is crucial for
advancing robust multimodal learning. We propose Robult, a scalable framework
designed to mitigate these challenges by preserving modality-specific
information and leveraging redundancy through a novel information-theoretic
approach. Robult optimizes two core objectives: (1) a soft Positive-Unlabeled
(PU) contrastive loss that maximizes task-relevant feature alignment while
effectively utilizing limited labeled data in semi-supervised settings, and (2)
a latent reconstruction loss that ensures unique modality-specific information
is retained. These strategies, embedded within a modular design, enhance
performance across various downstream tasks and ensure resilience to incomplete
modalities during inference. Experimental results across diverse datasets
validate that Robult achieves superior performance over existing approaches in
both semi-supervised learning and missing modality contexts. Furthermore, its
lightweight design promotes scalability and seamless integration with existing
architectures, making it suitable for real-world multimodal applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: t-SNE和UMAP等降维方法在可视化潜在聚类结构数据时，虽然能很好分离簇并保持局部信息，但往往会扭曲数据的全局几何结构

Method: 采用三步法：先对数据进行聚类，然后分别嵌入每个簇，最后对齐所有簇以获得全局嵌入

Result: 在多个合成和真实数据集上验证，该方法与现有方法竞争力相当，但更加透明

Conclusion: 模块化的聚类-嵌入-对齐方法提供了一种更透明且能更好保持全局结构的降维可视化方案

Abstract: Dimensionality reduction methods such as t-SNE and UMAP are popular methods
for visualizing data with a potential (latent) clustered structure. They are
known to group data points at the same time as they embed them, resulting in
visualizations with well-separated clusters that preserve local information
well. However, t-SNE and UMAP also tend to distort the global geometry of the
underlying data. We propose a more transparent, modular approach consisting of
first clustering the data, then embedding each cluster, and finally aligning
the clusters to obtain a global embedding. We demonstrate this approach on
several synthetic and real-world datasets and show that it is competitive with
existing methods, while being much more transparent.

Abstract: Proteins play crucial roles in almost all biological processes. The
advancement of deep learning has greatly accelerated the development of protein
foundation models, leading to significant successes in protein understanding
and design. However, the lack of systematic red-teaming for these models has
raised serious concerns about their potential misuse, such as generating
proteins with biological safety risks. This paper introduces SafeProtein, the
first red-teaming framework designed for protein foundation models to the best
of our knowledge. SafeProtein combines multimodal prompt engineering and
heuristic beam search to systematically design red-teaming methods and conduct
tests on protein foundation models. We also curated SafeProtein-Bench, which
includes a manually constructed red-teaming benchmark dataset and a
comprehensive evaluation protocol. SafeProtein achieved continuous jailbreaks
on state-of-the-art protein foundation models (up to 70% attack success rate
for ESM3), revealing potential biological safety risks in current protein
foundation models and providing insights for the development of robust security
protection technologies for frontier models. The codes will be made publicly

Conclusion: 图神经网络为医疗时序数据建模提供了有前景的方向，但在医疗领域的表示学习仍面临挑战，需要进一步研究来优化这种方法的实际应用效果。

Abstract: Sepsis is a serious, life-threatening condition. When treating sepsis, it is
challenging to determine the correct amount of intravenous fluids and
vasopressors for a given patient. While automated reinforcement learning
(RL)-based methods have been used to support these decisions with promising
results, previous studies have relied on relational data. Given the complexity
of modern healthcare data, representing data as a graph may provide a more
natural and effective approach. This study models patient data from the
well-known MIMIC-III dataset as a heterogeneous graph that evolves over time.
Subsequently, we explore two Graph Neural Network architectures - GraphSAGE and
GATv2 - for learning patient state representations, adopting the approach of
decoupling representation learning from policy learning. The encoders are
trained to produce latent state representations, jointly with decoders that
predict the next patient state. These representations are then used for policy
learning with the dBCQ algorithm. The results of our experimental evaluation
confirm the potential of a graph-based approach, while highlighting the
complexity of representation learning in this domain.

TL;DR: AEnt是一种针对LLM-RL训练的新熵控制方法，通过钳制熵奖励和自动调整系数来解决传统熵正则化在大语言模型强化学习中的失效问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统熵正则化在机器人控制和游戏RL中有效，但在LLM-RL训练中效果不佳，原因是LLM响应空间极大且最优输出稀疏

Method: 提出AEnt方法：使用钳制熵奖励（基于重归一化策略在较小token空间计算）和自动调整的熵系数，鼓励在更紧凑的响应集中探索

Result: 在数学推理任务中，AEnt在不同基础模型和数据集上均优于基线方法，在多个基准测试中表现一致更好

Conclusion: AEnt通过创新的熵控制机制有效解决了LLM-RL中的熵正则化问题，为语言模型强化学习提供了更有效的探索策略

Abstract: For RL algorithms, appropriate entropy control is crucial to their
effectiveness. To control the policy entropy, a commonly used method is entropy
regularization, which is adopted in various popular RL algorithms including
PPO, SAC and A3C. Although entropy regularization proves effective in robotic
and games RL conventionally, studies found that it gives weak to no gains in
LLM-RL training. In this work, we study the issues of entropy bonus in LLM-RL
setting. Specifically, we first argue that the conventional entropy
regularization suffers from the LLM's extremely large response space and the
sparsity of the optimal outputs. As a remedy, we propose AEnt, an entropy
control method that utilizes a new clamped entropy bonus with an automatically
adjusted coefficient. The clamped entropy is evaluated with the re-normalized
policy defined on certain smaller token space, which encourages exploration
within a more compact response set. In addition, the algorithm automatically
adjusts entropy coefficient according to the clamped entropy value, effectively
controlling the entropy-induced bias while leveraging the entropy's benefits.
AEnt is tested in math-reasoning tasks under different base models and
datasets, and it is observed that AEnt outperforms the baselines consistently
across multiple benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: KANs作为一种新兴的神经网络架构，虽然在各种科学和机器学习任务中表现出色，但其初始化策略尚未得到充分研究，需要系统性的初始化方案来提升性能。

Method: 提出了两种理论驱动的初始化方法（LeCun和Glorot启发式）和一个可调指数的经验幂律初始化家族，通过函数拟合、前向PDE基准测试、神经正切核分析以及Feynman数据集评估进行大规模网格搜索。

Result: Glorot启发的初始化在参数丰富的模型中显著优于基线，而幂律初始化在所有任务和不同架构规模下都取得了最强的整体性能。

Conclusion: 研究为KANs提供了有效的初始化策略，Glorot初始化适用于参数丰富的模型，幂律初始化具有最佳的通用性能，所有代码和数据已公开。

Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) are a recently introduced neural
architecture that replace fixed nonlinearities with trainable activation
functions, offering enhanced flexibility and interpretability. While KANs have
been applied successfully across scientific and machine learning tasks, their
initialization strategies remain largely unexplored. In this work, we study
initialization schemes for spline-based KANs, proposing two theory-driven
approaches inspired by LeCun and Glorot, as well as an empirical power-law
family with tunable exponents. Our evaluation combines large-scale grid
searches on function fitting and forward PDE benchmarks, an analysis of
training dynamics through the lens of the Neural Tangent Kernel, and
evaluations on a subset of the Feynman dataset. Our findings indicate that the
Glorot-inspired initialization significantly outperforms the baseline in
parameter-rich models, while power-law initialization achieves the strongest
performance overall, both across tasks and for architectures of varying size.

Motivation: 解决联邦学习中边缘设备因内存和通信限制被排除在训练之外的问题，减少系统偏见并增加数据可访问性。

Method: 基于MeZO零阶方法，设计ZOWarmUp算法，利用不同客户端能力和方差减少技术，仅需传输随机种子而非完整梯度。

Result: 实验表明ZOWarmUp在各种数据集和模型架构下都具有鲁棒性，能够有效利用低资源客户端的数据。

Conclusion: ZOWarmUp算法能够显著提高边缘设备的参与度，获得更多样化的数据，从而改善联邦学习的训练效果。

Abstract: Federated learning enables collaborative model training across numerous edge
devices without requiring participants to share data; however, memory and
communication constraints on these edge devices may preclude their
participation in training. We consider a setting in which a subset of edge
devices are below a critical memory or communication threshold required to
conduct model updates. Under typical federated optimization algorithms, these
devices are excluded from training which renders their data inaccessible and
increases system induced bias. We are inspired by MeZO, a zeroth-order method
used for memory-efficient fine-tuning. The increased variance inherent to
zeroth-order gradient approximations has relegated previous zeroth-order
optimizers exclusively to the domain of fine tuning; a limitation we seek to
correct. We devise a federated, memory-efficient zeroth-order optimizer,
ZOWarmUp that permits zeroth-order training from a random initialization.
ZOWarmUp leverages differing client capabilities and careful variance reduction
techniques to facilitate participation of under-represented, low-resource
clients in model training. Like other federated zeroth-order methods, ZOWarmUp
eliminates the need for edge devices to transmit their full gradients to the
server and instead relies on only a small set of random seeds, rendering the
up-link communication cost negligible. We present experiments using various
datasets and model architectures to show that ZOWarmUp is a robust algorithm
that can can be applied under a wide variety of circumstances. For systems with
a high proportion of edge devices that would otherwise be excluded from
training, this algorithm provides access to a greater volume and diversity of
data, thus improving training outcomes.

Motivation: 现有深度学习方法依赖3D结构或基于距离的接触标签，限制了应用范围和生物学相关性

Method: 使用结构监督的注意力机制，通过功能基团基序提取从3D复合物中获取交互标签，将配体结构抽象为功能基团

Result: 在LP-PDBBind基准测试中，基于功能基团抽象的结构监督能产生与真实生化注释高度一致的作用预测

Conclusion: LINKER仅需序列级输入即可实现大规模应用，特别适用于结构数据不可用的情况

Abstract: Accurate identification of interactions between protein residues and ligand
functional groups is essential to understand molecular recognition and guide
rational drug design. Existing deep learning approaches for protein-ligand
interpretability often rely on 3D structural input or use distance-based
contact labels, limiting both their applicability and biological relevance. We
introduce LINKER, the first sequence-based model to predict residue-functional
group interactions in terms of biologically defined interaction types, using
only protein sequences and the ligand SMILES as input. LINKER is trained with
structure-supervised attention, where interaction labels are derived from 3D
protein-ligand complexes via functional group-based motif extraction. By
abstracting ligand structures into functional groups, the model focuses on
chemically meaningful substructures while predicting interaction types rather
than mere spatial proximity. Crucially, LINKER requires only sequence-level
input at inference time, enabling large-scale application in settings where
structural data is unavailable. Experiments on the LP-PDBBind benchmark
demonstrate that structure-informed supervision over functional group
abstractions yields interaction predictions closely aligned with ground-truth
biochemical annotations.

Abstract: We argue that progress toward general intelligence requires complementary
foundation models grounded in language, the physical world, and structured
data. This report presents LimiX, the first installment of our large
structured-data models (LDMs). LimiX treats structured data as a joint
distribution over variables and missingness, thus capable of addressing a wide
range of tabular tasks through query-based conditional prediction via a single
model. LimiX is pretrained using masked joint-distribution modeling with an
episodic, context-conditional objective, where the model predicts for query
subsets conditioned on dataset-specific contexts, supporting rapid,
training-free adaptation at inference. We evaluate LimiX across 10 large
structured-data benchmarks with broad regimes of sample size, feature
dimensionality, class number, categorical-to-numerical feature ratio,
missingness, and sample-to-feature ratios. With a single model and a unified
interface, LimiX consistently surpasses strong baselines including
gradient-boosting trees, deep tabular networks, recent tabular foundation
models, and automated ensembles, as shown in Figure 1 and Figure 2. The
superiority holds across a wide range of tasks, such as classification,
regression, missing value imputation, and data generation, often by substantial
margins, while avoiding task-specific architectures or bespoke training per
task. All LimiX models are publicly accessible under Apache 2.0.

Abstract: Simulating particle dynamics with high fidelity is crucial for solving
real-world interaction and control tasks involving liquids in design, graphics,
and robotics. Recently, data-driven approaches, particularly those based on
graph neural networks (GNNs), have shown progress in tackling such problems.
However, these approaches are often limited to learning fluid behavior in
static free-fall environments or simple manipulation settings involving
primitive objects, often overlooking complex interactions with dynamically
moving kinematic rigid bodies. Here, we propose a GNN-based framework designed
from the ground up to learn the dynamics of liquids under rigid body
interactions and active manipulations, where particles are represented as graph
nodes and particle-object collisions are handled using surface representations
with the bounding volume hierarchy (BVH) algorithm. This approach enables the
network to model complex interactions between liquid particles and intricate
surface geometries. Our model accurately captures fluid behavior in dynamic
settings and can also function as a simulator in static free-fall environments.
Despite being trained on a single-object manipulation task of pouring, our
model generalizes effectively to environments with unseen objects and novel
manipulation tasks such as stirring and scooping. Finally, we show that the
learned dynamics can be leveraged to solve control and manipulation tasks using
gradient-based optimization methods.

Conclusion: TwF方法具有坚实的数学基础，其参数子空间的Banach子流形结构保证了顺序训练中映射保持的精确性

Abstract: In our earlier work, we introduced the principle of Tuning without Forgetting
(TwF) for sequential training of neural ODEs, where training samples are added
iteratively and parameters are updated within the subspace of control functions
that preserves the end-point mapping at previously learned samples on the
manifold of output labels in the first-order approximation sense. In this
letter, we prove that this parameter subspace forms a Banach submanifold of
finite codimension under nonsingular controls, and we characterize its tangent
space. This reveals that TwF corresponds to a continuation/deformation of the
control function along the tangent space of this Banach submanifold, providing
a theoretical foundation for its mapping-preserving (not forgetting) during the
sequential training exactly, beyond first-order approximation.

Abstract: Accurately obtaining crop type and its spatial distribution at a global scale
is critical for food security, agricultural policy-making, and sustainable
development. Remote sensing offers an efficient solution for large-scale crop
classification, but the limited availability of reliable ground samples in many
regions constrains applicability across geographic areas. To address
performance declines under geospatial shifts, this study identifies remote
sensing features that are invariant to geographic variation and proposes
strategies to enhance cross-regional generalization. We construct CropGlobe, a
global crop type dataset with 300,000 pixel-level samples from eight countries
across five continents, covering six major food and industrial crops (corn,
soybeans, rice, wheat, sugarcane, cotton). With broad geographic coverage,
CropGlobe enables a systematic evaluation under cross-country, cross-continent,
and cross-hemisphere transfer. We compare the transferability of temporal
multi-spectral features (Sentinel-2-based 1D/2D median features and harmonic
coefficients) and hyperspectral features (from EMIT). To improve generalization
under spectral and phenological shifts, we design CropNet, a lightweight and
robust CNN tailored for pixel-level crop classification, coupled with temporal
data augmentation (time shift, time scale, and magnitude warping) that
simulates realistic cross-regional phenology. Experiments show that 2D median
temporal features from Sentinel-2 consistently exhibit the strongest invariance
across all transfer scenarios, and augmentation further improves robustness,
particularly when training data diversity is limited. Overall, the work

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities across
a variety of tasks, but their increasing autonomy in real-world applications
raises concerns about their trustworthiness. While hallucinations-unintentional
falsehoods-have been widely studied, the phenomenon of lying, where an LLM
knowingly generates falsehoods to achieve an ulterior objective, remains
underexplored. In this work, we systematically investigate the lying behavior
of LLMs, differentiating it from hallucinations and testing it in practical
scenarios. Through mechanistic interpretability techniques, we uncover the
neural mechanisms underlying deception, employing logit lens analysis, causal
interventions, and contrastive activation steering to identify and control
deceptive behavior. We study real-world lying scenarios and introduce
behavioral steering vectors that enable fine-grained manipulation of lying
tendencies. Further, we explore the trade-offs between lying and end-task
performance, establishing a Pareto frontier where dishonesty can enhance goal
optimization. Our findings contribute to the broader discourse on AI ethics,
shedding light on the risks and potential safeguards for deploying LLMs in
high-stakes environments. Code and more illustrations are available at

TL;DR: 这篇论文通过实例分析提醒技术人员在部署聊天机器人时需考虑社会价值和影响，避免因迅速采纳技术而忽视重要社会因素


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 企业在迅速采纳聊天机器技术进行客户服务时存在判断失误，需要重视部署前的基础考虑因素

Method: 通过具体案例研究进行分析，从中提炼经验教训

Result: 提出了聊天机器部署前必须考虑的基础要素和社会价值因素

Conclusion: 聊天机器技术部署需以社会价值为首要考量因素，应先考虑其社会影响再采取行动

Abstract: Automatic conversation systems based on natural language responses are
becoming ubiquitous, in part, due to major advances in computational
linguistics and machine learning. The easy access to robust and affordable
platforms are causing companies to have an unprecedented rush to adopt chatbot
technologies for customer service and support. However, this rush has caused
judgment lapses when releasing chatbot technologies into production systems.
This paper aims to shed light on basic, elemental, considerations that
technologists must consider before deploying a chatbot. Our approach takes one
particular case to draw lessons for those considering the implementation of
chatbots. By looking at this case-study, we aim to call for consideration of
societal values as a paramount factor before deploying a chatbot and consider
the societal implications of releasing these types of systems.

Method: 与三个在机器人开发中代表性不足的社区进行工坊：科学节公众、女性计算机科学家和人文学者。使用社交机器人共同设计应用程床收集定性数据，通过主题分析进行分析。

Result: 识别出四个关于健康机器人真实使用的关键供理论理和社会技术问题：1）机器人是否安全？2）机器人为谁而建？3）谁拥有机器人和数据？4）为什么要用机器人？这些问题构成了一个可用于机器人开发和部署的思考框架。

Abstract: Recent studies indicate that robotic coaches can play a crucial role in
promoting wellbeing. However, the real-world deployment of wellbeing robots
raises numerous ethical and socio-technical questions and concerns. To explore
these questions, we undertake a community-centered investigation to examine
three different communities' perspectives on using robotic wellbeing coaches in
real-world environments. We frame our work as an anticipatory ethical
investigation, which we undertake to better inform the development of robotic
technologies with communities' opinions, with the ultimate goal of aligning
robot development with public interest. We conducted workshops with three
communities who are under-represented in robotics development: 1) members of
the public at a science festival, 2) women computer scientists at a conference,
and 3) humanities researchers interested in history and philosophy of science.
In the workshops, we collected qualitative data using the Social Robot
Co-Design Canvas on Ethics. We analysed the collected qualitative data with
Thematic Analysis, informed by notes taken during workshops. Through our
analysis, we identify four themes regarding key ethical and socio-technical
questions about the real-world use of wellbeing robots. We group participants'
insights and discussions around these broad thematic questions, discuss them in
light of state-of-the-art literature, and highlight areas for future
investigation. Finally, we provide the four questions as a broad framework that
roboticists can and should use during robotic development and deployment, in
order to reflect on the ethics and socio-technical dimensions of their robotic
applications, and to engage in dialogue with communities of robot users. The
four questions are: 1) Is the robot safe and how can we know that?, 2) Who is
the robot built for and with?, 3) Who owns the robot and the data?, and 4) Why
a robot?.

TL;DR: 通过大语言模型分析40,037篇气候文章，研究发现了行星边界与可持续发展目标之间的相互作用，包括21.1%的真正台江和28.3%的协同效应，并提出了整合政策建议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究行星边界(PBs)与可持续发展目标(SDGs)之间的相互作用关系，以明确真正的台江与协同关系，为制定整合政策提供基础。

Method: 使用大语言模型(LLMs)分析40,037篇气候相关文章，通过自动化推理器区分真正台江(SDG进展损害PBs)、协同效应(相互增强)以及双重正面/负面关系(共享驱动因素)。

Result: 结果显示21.1%的真正台江关系，28.3%的协同关系，19.5%的中性作用，其余为双重正面或负面关系。关键发现包括土地利用目标(SDG2/SDG6)与土地系统边界(PB6)的冲突，以及社会类SDGs在气候文献中的代表性不足。

Conclusion: 研究强调需要整合政策来对齐发展目标与行星限制，减少系统性冲突。提出三步建议：(1)整合社会-生态指标，(2)确保SDG进展尊重地球系统限制的治理机制，(3)保护边缘群体免受边界遵守成本的公平措施。

Abstract: By analyzing 40,037 climate articles using Large Language Models (LLMs), we
identified interactions between Planetary Boundaries (PBs) and Sustainable
Development Goals (SDGs). An automated reasoner distinguished true trade-offs
(SDG progress harming PBs) and synergies (mutual reinforcement) from double
positives and negatives (shared drivers). Results show 21.1% true trade-offs,
28.3% synergies, and 19.5% neutral interactions, with the remainder being
double positive or negative. Key findings include conflicts between land-use
goals (SDG2/SDG6) and land system boundaries (PB6), together with the
underrepresentation of social SDGs in the climate literature. Our study
highlights the need for integrated policies that align development goals with
planetary limits to reduce systemic conflicts. We propose three steps: (1)
integrated socio-ecological metrics, (2) governance ensuring that SDG progress
respects Earth system limits, and (3) equity measures protecting marginalized
groups from boundary compliance costs.

TL;DR: 研究发现大型语言模型在长期运行场景中会表现出类似无限制效用最大化的危险行为，即使表面看似多目标优化，底层机制仍偏向单目标和无限最大化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 验证RL中的无限制效用最大化问题在LLMs中是否仍然存在，探究LLMs在长期运行和多目标场景下的行为模式。

Method: 通过长期运行场景测试LLMs的行为表现，观察其在多目标或竞争目标条件下的系统性失败模式。

Result: LLMs在长期运行中会随机触发问题行为倾向，表现为忽略稳态目标、默认无限制最大化、回归单目标优化，且一旦出现问题行为通常无法恢复。

Conclusion: 尽管LLMs表面看似多目标和有界优化，但其底层机制实际上仍偏向单目标和无限最大化，这在长期运行场景中构成潜在风险。

Abstract: Relatively many past AI safety discussions have centered around the dangers
of unbounded utility maximisation by RL agents, illustrated by scenarios like
the "paperclip maximiser" or by specification gaming in general. Unbounded
maximisation is problematic for many reasons. We wanted to verify whether these
RL runaway optimisation problems are still relevant with LLMs as well. Turns
out, strangely, this is indeed clearly the case. The problem is not that the
LLMs just lose context or become incoherent. The problem is that in various
scenarios, LLMs lose context in very specific ways, which systematically
resemble runaway optimisers in the following distinct ways: 1) Ignoring
homeostatic targets and "defaulting" to unbounded maximisation instead. 2) It
is equally concerning that the "default" meant also reverting back to
single-objective optimisation. Our findings also suggest that long-running
scenarios are important. Systematic failures emerge after periods of initially
successful behaviour. In some trials the LLMs were successful until the end.
This means, while current LLMs do conceptually grasp biological and economic
alignment, they exhibit randomly triggered problematic behavioural tendencies
under sustained long-running conditions, particularly involving multiple or
competing objectives. Once they flip, they usually do not recover. Even though
LLMs look multi-objective and bounded on the surface, the underlying mechanisms
seem to be actually still biased towards being single-objective and unbounded.

Conclusion: 计算方法可以为教育技术领域的批判性研究提供价值，但需要重新思考其在关键性、哲学基础、包容性、上下文、分类和责任等方面的应用方式，以保证其符合批判研究的目标和价值观。

Abstract: As belief around the potential of computational social science grows, fuelled
by recent advances in machine learning, data scientists are ostensibly becoming
the new experts in education. Scholars engaged in critical studies of education
and technology have sought to interrogate the growing datafication of education
yet tend not to use computational methods as part of this response. In this
paper, we discuss the feasibility and desirability of the use of computational
approaches as part of a critical research agenda. Presenting and reflecting
upon two examples of projects that use computational methods in education to
explore questions of equity and justice, we suggest that such approaches might
help expand the capacity of critical researchers to highlight existing
inequalities, make visible possible approaches for beginning to address such
inequalities, and engage marginalised communities in designing and ultimately
deploying these possibilities. Drawing upon work within the fields of Critical
Data Studies and Science and Technology Studies, we further reflect on the two
cases to discuss the possibilities and challenges of reimagining computational
methods for critical research in education and technology, focusing on six
areas of consideration: criticality, philosophy, inclusivity, context,
classification, and responsibility.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决95%企业从AI部署中未获得可观测利润影响的问题，认为这是因为现有AI策略偏向于增量优化而非结构性变革。

Method: 采用跨案例分析方法，提出一个2x2框架，将AI策略重新概念化为两个独立维度：变革程度（增量到转型）和人类贡献处理方式（减少到增强）。

Result: 识别出四种主导实践模式，前三种模式强化传统工作模式仅获得局部收益，协作智能模式需要解决三个关键机制：互补性、共同进化和边界设定。

Conclusion: AI转型应重新框架为组织设计挑战，从优化人机分工转向设计人机融合，对运营模式、劳动力发展和未来工作产生重大影响。

Abstract: Despite extensive investment in artificial intelligence, 95% of enterprises
report no measurable profit impact from AI deployments (MIT, 2025). We argue
that this gap reflects paradigmatic lock-in that channels AI into incremental
optimization rather than structural transformation. Using a cross-case
analysis, we propose a 2x2 framework that reconceptualizes AI strategy along
two independent dimensions: the degree of transformation achieved (incremental
to transformational) and the treatment of human contribution (reduced to
amplified). The framework surfaces four patterns now dominant in practice:
individual augmentation, process automation, workforce substitution, and a less
deployed frontier of collaborative intelligence. Evidence shows that the first
three reinforce legacy work models and yield localized gains without durable
value capture. Realizing collaborative intelligence requires three mechanisms:
complementarity (pairing distinct human and machine strengths), co-evolution
(mutual adaptation through interaction), and boundary-setting (human
determination of ethical and strategic parameters). Complementarity and
boundary-setting are observable in regulated and high-stakes domains;
co-evolution is largely absent, which helps explain limited system-level
impact. A case study analysis illustrates that advancing toward collaborative
intelligence requires material restructuring of roles, governance, and data
architecture rather than additional tools. The framework reframes AI
transformation as an organizational design challenge: moving from optimizing
the division of labor between humans and machines to architecting their
convergence, with implications for operating models, workforce development, and
the future of work.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 四次工业革命导致來自机器人、自动化、AI和安全领域的新工作需求，广泛存在技能空缺，特别是在年长工人中。需要通过再培训和技能提升来建设相应的劳动力队伍。

Method: 将生成式AI教学辅助系统集成到现有的体验式学习平台中，使用零检测OCR-LLM流水线：首先通过Tesseract OCR从幻灯片图片中提取文本，然后用通用LLM生成简化的指令，以最小的基础设施实现实时教学支持。

Result: 在大学课程中进行了实际评估，学生反馈（n=42）平均分数为7.83/10，显示出强烈的感知有用性。与直接解释幻灯片图像的多模态LLM进行对比研究，发现在视觉密集的幻灯片上性能更高，但在以文本为中心的幻灯片上，OCR-LLM流水线提供了相似的教学价值且计算开销和成本更低。

Conclusion: 这项工作证明，轻量级且容易集成的流水线可以有效地为传统平台添加现代生成式AI功能，为技术教育中的学生理解提供可扩展的增强。

Abstract: This full paper describes an LLM-assisted instruction integrated with a
virtual cybersecurity lab platform. The digital transformation of Fourth
Industrial Revolution (4IR) systems is reshaping workforce needs, widening
skill gaps, especially among older workers. With rising emphasis on robotics,
automation, AI, and security, re-skilling and up-skilling are essential.
Generative AI can help build this workforce by acting as an instructional
assistant to support skill acquisition during experiential learning. We present
a generative AI instructional assistant integrated into a prior experiential
learning platform. The assistant employs a zero-shot OCR-LLM pipeline within
the legacy Cybersecurity Labs-as-a-Service (CLaaS) platform (2015). Text is
extracted from slide images using Tesseract OCR, then simplified instructions
are generated via a general-purpose LLM, enabling real-time instructional
support with minimal infrastructure. The system was evaluated in a live
university course where student feedback (n=42) averaged 7.83/10, indicating
strong perceived usefulness. A comparative study with multimodal LLMs that
directly interpret slide images showed higher performance on visually dense
slides, but the OCR-LLM pipeline provided comparable pedagogical value on
text-centric slides with much lower computational overhead and cost. This work
demonstrates that a lightweight, easily integrable pipeline can effectively
extend legacy platforms with modern generative AI, offering scalable
enhancements for student comprehension in technical education.

Abstract: The growing adoption of generative AI in education highlights the need to
integrate established pedagogical principles into AI-assisted learning
environments. This study investigates the potential of metacognitive theory to
inform AI-assisted programming education through a hint system designed around
the metacognitive phases of planning, monitoring, and evaluation. Upon request,
the system can provide three types of AI-generated hints--planning, debugging,
and optimization--to guide students at different stages of problem-solving.
Through a study with 102 students in an introductory data science programming
course, we find that students perceive and engage with planning hints most
highly, whereas optimization hints are rarely requested. We observe a
consistent association between requesting planning hints and achieving higher
grades across question difficulty and student competency. However, when facing
harder tasks, students seek additional debugging but not more planning support.
These insights contribute to the growing field of AI-assisted programming
education by providing empirical evidence on the importance of pedagogical
principles in AI-assisted learning.

Abstract: Generative AI has the potential to enhance education by providing
personalized feedback to students at scale. Recent work has proposed techniques
to improve AI-generated programming hints and has evaluated their performance
based on expert-designed rubrics or student ratings. However, it remains
unclear how the rubrics used to design these techniques align with students'
perceived helpfulness of hints. In this paper, we systematically study the
mismatches in perceived hint quality from students' and experts' perspectives
based on the deployment of AI-generated hints in a Python programming course.
We analyze scenarios with discrepancies between student and expert evaluations,
in particular, where experts rated a hint as high-quality while the student
found it unhelpful. We identify key reasons for these discrepancies and
classify them into categories, such as hints not accounting for the student's
main concern or not considering previous help requests. Finally, we propose and
discuss preliminary results on potential methods to bridge these gaps, first by
extending the expert-designed quality rubric and then by adapting the hint
generation process, e.g., incorporating the student's comments or history.
These efforts contribute toward scalable, personalized, and pedagogically sound
AI-assisted feedback systems, which are particularly important for
high-enrollment educational settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多语言大语言模型的偏见评估主要集中于英语语境，缺乏对其他语言和文化背景的系统性评估，特别是西班牙语在拉丁美洲文化环境中的偏见表现。

Method: 采用文化基础框架，基于BBQ数据集的未明确问题方法，融入文化特定表达和谚语，涵盖性别、种族、社会经济阶层和国籍四个社会类别，使用4000多个提示进行测试。

Result: 研究发现领先的商业LLMs在西班牙语文化特定偏见中表现出不同的偏见模式，英语优化的偏见缓解技术对西班牙语任务无效，偏见模式在不同采样温度下保持一致。

Conclusion: 该模块化框架可扩展到新的刻板印象、偏见类别或语言文化背景，为在多样化语言环境中实现更公平和文化感知的AI系统评估迈出重要一步。

Abstract: This paper addresses the critical gap in evaluating bias in multilingual
Large Language Models (LLMs), with a specific focus on Spanish language within
culturally-aware Latin American contexts. Despite widespread global deployment,
current evaluations remain predominantly US-English-centric, leaving potential
harms in other linguistic and cultural contexts largely underexamined. We
introduce a novel, culturally-grounded framework for detecting social biases in
instruction-tuned LLMs. Our approach adapts the underspecified question
methodology from the BBQ dataset by incorporating culturally-specific
expressions and sayings that encode regional stereotypes across four social
categories: gender, race, socioeconomic class, and national origin. Using more
than 4,000 prompts, we propose a new metric that combines accuracy with the
direction of error to effectively balance model performance and bias alignment
in both ambiguous and disambiguated contexts. To our knowledge, our work
presents the first systematic evaluation examining how leading commercial LLMs
respond to culturally specific bias in the Spanish language, revealing varying
patterns of bias manifestation across state-of-the-art models. We also
contribute evidence that bias mitigation techniques optimized for English do
not effectively transfer to Spanish tasks, and that bias patterns remain
largely consistent across different sampling temperatures. Our modular
framework offers a natural extension to new stereotypes, bias categories, or
languages and cultural contexts, representing a significant step toward more
equitable and culturally-aware evaluation of AI systems in the diverse
linguistic environments where they operate.
