TL;DR: 通过CHAIR指标和DPO对齐训练，有效减少多模态大语言模型的幻觉问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型(MLLMs)存在严重的幻觉问题，生成与视觉输入不符的回答，需要找到简单有效的对齐方案

Method: 利用CHAIR指标评估生成回答的幻觉程度，通过Direct Preference Optimization(DPO)方法进行偏好对齐训练，构建非幻觉和幻觉样本对

Result: CHAIR-DPO方法在多个幻觉测试集上显著减少了幻觉回答的数量，证明了基于CHAIR奖励的精细调整的有效性

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种简单但有效的方案来减少MLLMs的幻觉问题，无需复杂的管道或依赖专有模型，具有良好的应用前景

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) emerge as a unified interface to
address a multitude of tasks, ranging from NLP to computer vision. Despite
showcasing state-of-the-art results in many benchmarks, a long-standing issue
is the tendency of MLLMs to hallucinate, that is to generate answers to the
user's query that are not reflected in the visual input. In this paper, we
address the problem of hallucinations as an alignment problem, seeking to steer
the MLLM so that it prefers generating content without hallucinations. In
contrast to recent approaches that require complicated pipelines to build
synthetic preference data for alignment training, often relying on proprietary
models, we capitalize on the well-known CHAIR metric, originally proposed to
gauge the degree of hallucinations in image captioning. Given a pair of
generated answers, we leverage CHAIR to distinguish winner and loser options
(i.e., non-hallucinated and hallucinated samples) and fine-tune off-the-shelf
MLLMs via Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). The resulting method, which we
refer to as CHAIR-DPO, effectively diminishes the amount of hallucinated
answers on several hallucination benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of
fine-tuning the MLLM with a CHAIR-based reward. Source code and trained models
are publicly available at https://github.com/aimagelab/CHAIR-DPO.

*Yang Su,Shunquan Tan,Jiwu Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 基于Stable Diffusion 3的多模态框架，通过将伪造残差作为显式模态融入潜空间，实现了更高效准确的图像伪造定位方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像伪造定位方法依赖人工标注数据，成本高且难以跟上新兴多模态大模型带来的图像编辑技术挑战

Method: 利用SD3的多模态处理能力，将高速筛波器提取的伪造残差信号作为显式模态融入潜空间，保留输入图像的丰富语义信息

Result: 在广泛使用的标准数据集上较目前最佳方法提升12%性能提升，对训练未见的真实文档伪造和自然场景图像也表现出强劲性能

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了依赖人工标注数据的问题，为应对新兴多模态图像编辑技术的伪造检测提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Driven by the new generation of multi-modal large models, such as Stable
Diffusion (SD), image manipulation technologies have advanced rapidly, posing
significant challenges to image forensics. However, existing image forgery
localization methods, which heavily rely on labor-intensive and costly
annotated data, are struggling to keep pace with these emerging image
manipulation technologies. To address these challenges, we are the first to
integrate both image generation and powerful perceptual capabilities of SD into
an image forensic framework, enabling more efficient and accurate forgery
localization. First, we theoretically show that the multi-modal architecture of
SD can be conditioned on forgery-related information, enabling the model to
inherently output forgery localization results. Then, building on this
foundation, we specifically leverage the multimodal framework of Stable
DiffusionV3 (SD3) to enhance forgery localization performance.We leverage the
multi-modal processing capabilities of SD3 in the latent space by treating
image forgery residuals -- high-frequency signals extracted using specific
highpass filters -- as an explicit modality. This modality is fused into the
latent space during training to enhance forgery localization performance.
Notably, our method fully preserves the latent features extracted by SD3,
thereby retaining the rich semantic information of the input image.
Experimental results show that our framework achieves up to 12% improvements in
performance on widely used benchmarking datasets compared to current
state-of-the-art image forgery localization models. Encouragingly, the model
demonstrates strong performance on forensic tasks involving real-world document
forgery images and natural scene forging images, even when such data were
entirely unseen during training.

### [3] [Grounding Multimodal Large Language Models with Quantitative Skin Attributes: A Retrieval Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20188)
*Max Torop,Masih Eskandar,Nicholas Kurtansky,Jinyang Liu,Jochen Weber,Octavia Camps,Veronica Rotemberg,Jennifer Dy,Kivanc Kose*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究探索将多模态大语言模型与定量属性相结合，通过微调使模型能够从图像预测皮肤病变属性值，从而提升AI皮肤疾病诊断模型的可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI模型在皮肤疾病诊断方面表现出色，但模型预测的可解释性不足限制了其实际临床应用。需要找到方法让模型提供更直观的诊断理由和解释。

Method: 结合多模态大语言模型和定量属性分析，通过微调使MLLM能够从皮肤病变图像预测相关属性值（如病变面积等），并在SLICE-3D数据集上进行基于属性的图像检索案例研究。

Result: 研究表明MLLM的嵌入空间可以通过微调来与定量属性建立关联，使模型能够从图像预测这些属性值，为诊断提供更可解释的基础。

Conclusion: 多模态大语言模型与定量属性的结合为提升AI皮肤疾病诊断模型的可解释性提供了有前景的途径，通过属性预测和自然语言推理可以增强临床实用性。

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence models have demonstrated significant success in
diagnosing skin diseases, including cancer, showing the potential to assist
clinicians in their analysis. However, the interpretability of model
predictions must be significantly improved before they can be used in practice.
To this end, we explore the combination of two promising approaches: Multimodal
Large Language Models (MLLMs) and quantitative attribute usage. MLLMs offer a
potential avenue for increased interpretability, providing reasoning for
diagnosis in natural language through an interactive format. Separately, a
number of quantitative attributes that are related to lesion appearance (e.g.,
lesion area) have recently been found predictive of malignancy with high
accuracy. Predictions grounded as a function of such concepts have the
potential for improved interpretability. We provide evidence that MLLM
embedding spaces can be grounded in such attributes, through fine-tuning to
predict their values from images. Concretely, we evaluate this grounding in the
embedding space through an attribute-specific content-based image retrieval
case study using the SLICE-3D dataset.

### [4] [Enhancing Automatic Modulation Recognition With a Reconstruction-Driven Vision Transformer Under Limited Labels](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20193)
*Hossein Ahmadi,Banafsheh Saffari*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出基于Vision Transformer的统一框架，结合监督、自监督和重建目标，在少量标注数据下实现高效自动调制识别


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自动调制识别方法依赖大量标注数据或多阶段训练流程，限制了实际应用中的可扩展性和泛化能力

Method: 使用ViT编码器、轻量卷积解码器和线性分类器，通过重建分支将增强信号映射回原始信号，在预训练中学习鲁棒特征，在微调中使用部分标签监督

Result: 在RML2018.01A数据集上，低标签情况下优于监督CNN和ViT基线，仅用15-20%标注数据即可达到ResNet水平精度，在不同SNR下保持强性能

Conclusion: 该框架为自动调制识别提供了简单、可泛化且标签高效的解决方案

Abstract: Automatic modulation recognition (AMR) is critical for cognitive radio,
spectrum monitoring, and secure wireless communication. However, existing
solutions often rely on large labeled datasets or multi-stage training
pipelines, which limit scalability and generalization in practice. We propose a
unified Vision Transformer (ViT) framework that integrates supervised,
self-supervised, and reconstruction objectives. The model combines a ViT
encoder, a lightweight convolutional decoder, and a linear classifier; the
reconstruction branch maps augmented signals back to their originals, anchoring
the encoder to fine-grained I/Q structure. This strategy promotes robust,
discriminative feature learning during pretraining, while partial label
supervision in fine-tuning enables effective classification with limited
labels. On the RML2018.01A dataset, our approach outperforms supervised CNN and
ViT baselines in low-label regimes, approaches ResNet-level accuracy with only
15-20% labeled data, and maintains strong performance across varying SNR
levels. Overall, the framework provides a simple, generalizable, and
label-efficient solution for AMR.

### [5] [InfinityHuman: Towards Long-Term Audio-Driven Human](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20210)
*Xiaodi Li,Pan Xie,Yi Ren,Qijun Gan,Chen Zhang,Fangyuan Kong,Xiang Yin,Bingyue Peng,Zehuan Yuan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: InfinityHuman是一个从粗到细的音频驱动人体动画框架，通过姿态引导的细化器生成高分辨率长视频，解决了身份漂移和手部运动失真问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有音频驱动人体动画方法存在错误累积导致身份漂移、颜色偏移和场景不稳定，且手部运动建模不佳，与音频不同步。

Method: 采用粗到细框架：首先生成音频同步表示，然后使用姿态引导细化器逐步细化成高分辨率长视频。利用解耦的姿态序列和初始帧作为视觉锚点减少漂移，并引入手部特定奖励机制提升手势真实感。

Result: 在EMTD和HDTF数据集上达到最先进的视频质量、身份保持、手部准确性和唇部同步性能，消融研究证实各模块有效性。

Conclusion: InfinityHuman通过稳定的姿态引导和手部奖励机制，有效解决了音频驱动动画中的身份漂移和手部失真问题，实现了高质量的长视频生成。

Abstract: Audio-driven human animation has attracted wide attention thanks to its
practical applications. However, critical challenges remain in generating
high-resolution, long-duration videos with consistent appearance and natural
hand motions. Existing methods extend videos using overlapping motion frames
but suffer from error accumulation, leading to identity drift, color shifts,
and scene instability. Additionally, hand movements are poorly modeled,
resulting in noticeable distortions and misalignment with the audio. In this
work, we propose InfinityHuman, a coarse-to-fine framework that first generates
audio-synchronized representations, then progressively refines them into
high-resolution, long-duration videos using a pose-guided refiner. Since pose
sequences are decoupled from appearance and resist temporal degradation, our
pose-guided refiner employs stable poses and the initial frame as a visual
anchor to reduce drift and improve lip synchronization. Moreover, to enhance
semantic accuracy and gesture realism, we introduce a hand-specific reward
mechanism trained with high-quality hand motion data. Experiments on the EMTD
and HDTF datasets show that InfinityHuman achieves state-of-the-art performance
in video quality, identity preservation, hand accuracy, and lip-sync. Ablation
studies further confirm the effectiveness of each module. Code will be made
public.

### [6] [Spherical Vision Transformers for Audio-Visual Saliency Prediction in 360-Degree Videos](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20221)
*Mert Cokelek,Halit Ozsoy,Nevrez Imamoglu,Cagri Ozcinar,Inci Ayhan,Erkut Erdem,Aykut Erdem*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究提出了首个360度视听显著性预测数据集YT360-EyeTracking和两个基于视觉Transformer的显著性预测模型SalViT360和SalViT360-AV，通过整合空间音频线索显著提升了全景视频中的视觉注意力预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于缺乏全面的360度视听显著性预测数据集，且现有方法未充分考虑球面畸变和空间音频的整合，研究旨在探索如何利用视听线索有效预测360度视频中的视觉显著性。

Method: 构建了包含81个全景视频的YT360-EyeTracking数据集，提出了基于视觉Transformer的SalViT360框架（配备球面几何感知的时空注意力层）和SalViT360-AV模型（进一步整合音频输入的Transformer适配器）。

Result: 在多个基准数据集（包括YT360-EyeTracking）上的实验结果表明，SalViT360和SalViT360-AV在预测360度场景中观众注意力方面显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 在模型架构中整合空间音频线索对于准确预测全景视频中的显著性至关重要，音频信息是提升360度视频显著性预测性能的关键因素。

Abstract: Omnidirectional videos (ODVs) are redefining viewer experiences in virtual
reality (VR) by offering an unprecedented full field-of-view (FOV). This study
extends the domain of saliency prediction to 360-degree environments,
addressing the complexities of spherical distortion and the integration of
spatial audio. Contextually, ODVs have transformed user experience by adding a
spatial audio dimension that aligns sound direction with the viewer's
perspective in spherical scenes. Motivated by the lack of comprehensive
datasets for 360-degree audio-visual saliency prediction, our study curates
YT360-EyeTracking, a new dataset of 81 ODVs, each observed under varying
audio-visual conditions. Our goal is to explore how to utilize audio-visual
cues to effectively predict visual saliency in 360-degree videos. Towards this
aim, we propose two novel saliency prediction models: SalViT360, a
vision-transformer-based framework for ODVs equipped with spherical
geometry-aware spatio-temporal attention layers, and SalViT360-AV, which
further incorporates transformer adapters conditioned on audio input. Our
results on a number of benchmark datasets, including our YT360-EyeTracking,
demonstrate that SalViT360 and SalViT360-AV significantly outperform existing
methods in predicting viewer attention in 360-degree scenes. Interpreting these
results, we suggest that integrating spatial audio cues in the model
architecture is crucial for accurate saliency prediction in omnidirectional
videos. Code and dataset will be available at
https://cyberiada.github.io/SalViT360.

### [7] [A Novel Framework for Automated Explain Vision Model Using Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20227)
*Phu-Vinh Nguyen,Tan-Hanh Pham,Chris Ngo,Truong Son Hy*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个基于视觉-语言模型的流水线，用于解释视觉模型在样本和数据集层面的行为，以发现失败案例并提升模型可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉模型开发主要关注性能指标，而缺乏对模型一般行为的解释方法。理解模型在普通图像上的行为对避免偏见判断和识别模型趋势至关重要。

Method: 利用视觉-语言模型构建流水线，能够同时在样本级别和数据集级别对视觉模型进行解释。该方法通过大规模数据集运行来抓取模型的一般行为模式。

Result: 提出的流水线可以用最小化的努力发现视觉模型的失败案例，并获得模型行为的深度见解。

Conclusion: 该研究将视觉模型开发与可解释性AI分析相结合，促进了图像分析领域的发展，为解释视觉模型的一般行为提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: The development of many vision models mainly focuses on improving their
performance using metrics such as accuracy, IoU, and mAP, with less attention
to explainability due to the complexity of applying xAI methods to provide a
meaningful explanation of trained models. Although many existing xAI methods
aim to explain vision models sample-by-sample, methods explaining the general
behavior of vision models, which can only be captured after running on a large
dataset, are still underexplored. Furthermore, understanding the behavior of
vision models on general images can be very important to prevent biased
judgments and help identify the model's trends and patterns. With the
application of Vision-Language Models, this paper proposes a pipeline to
explain vision models at both the sample and dataset levels. The proposed
pipeline can be used to discover failure cases and gain insights into vision
models with minimal effort, thereby integrating vision model development with
xAI analysis to advance image analysis.

TL;DR: ATMS-KD是一种新颖的知识蒸馏框架，结合自适应温度调度和混合样本增强，用于在资源受限的农业环境中开发轻量级CNN模型，在玫瑰成熟度分类任务上取得了优异性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对农业环境中资源受限的挑战，需要开发轻量级但高性能的CNN模型，以在计算资源有限的设备上实现准确的农作物视觉分析。

Method: 提出ATMS-KD框架，结合自适应温度调度和混合样本增强技术，从MobileNetV3 Large教师模型向轻量级残差CNN学生模型进行知识蒸馏，评估了三种不同参数规模的学生配置。

Result: 所有学生模型验证准确率超过96.7%，相比直接训练的95-96%有显著提升。紧凑模型达到97.11%准确率，比次优方法提高1.60个百分点，同时保持最低72.19ms推理延迟，知识保留率超过99%。

Conclusion: ATMS-KD框架在农业计算机视觉应用中表现出色，能够有效实现知识转移，为资源受限环境下的轻量级模型开发提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: This study proposes ATMS-KD (Adaptive Temperature and Mixed-Sample Knowledge
Distillation), a novel framework for developing lightweight CNN models suitable
for resource-constrained agricultural environments. The framework combines
adaptive temperature scheduling with mixed-sample augmentation to transfer
knowledge from a MobileNetV3 Large teacher model (5.7\,M parameters) to
lightweight residual CNN students. Three student configurations were evaluated:
Compact (1.3\,M parameters), Standard (2.4\,M parameters), and Enhanced (3.8\,M
parameters). The dataset used in this study consists of images of \textit{Rosa
damascena} (Damask rose) collected from agricultural fields in the Dades Oasis,
southeastern Morocco, providing a realistic benchmark for agricultural computer
vision applications under diverse environmental conditions. Experimental
evaluation on the Damascena rose maturity classification dataset demonstrated
significant improvements over direct training methods. All student models
achieved validation accuracies exceeding 96.7\% with ATMS-KD compared to
95--96\% with direct training. The framework outperformed eleven established
knowledge distillation methods, achieving 97.11\% accuracy with the compact
model -- a 1.60 percentage point improvement over the second-best approach
while maintaining the lowest inference latency of 72.19\,ms. Knowledge
retention rates exceeded 99\% for all configurations, demonstrating effective
knowledge transfer regardless of student model capacity.

### [9] [Linking heterogeneous microstructure informatics with expert characterization knowledge through customized and hybrid vision-language representations for industrial qualification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20243)
*Mutahar Safdar,Gentry Wood,Max Zimmermann,Guy Lamouche,Priti Wanjara,Yaoyao Fiona Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究开发了一种结合视觉-语言表示(VLRs)的新框架，通过深度语义分割和多模态模型(CLIP和FLAVA)将微观结构数据与专家评估文本编码为共享表示，实现零样本分类和材料质量评估。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决工业制造中先进材料快速可靠鉴定的瓶颈问题，特别是针对非传统增材制造工艺生产的异质结构材料。

Method: 集成深度语义分割与预训练多模态模型(CLIP和FLAVA)，开发定制化的基于相似性的表示方法，结合专家标注的图像和文本描述，使用Z-score归一化处理相似性分数。

Result: 在增材制造金属基复合材料数据集上验证，能够区分合格和缺陷样品，FLAVA模型具有更高的视觉敏感性，CLIP模型与文本标准一致性更好。

Conclusion: 该方法通过促进原始数据与专家知识之间的语义互操作性，为工程信息学提供了可扩展和领域适应的鉴定策略，增强了鉴定流程的可追溯性和可解释性。

Abstract: Rapid and reliable qualification of advanced materials remains a bottleneck
in industrial manufacturing, particularly for heterogeneous structures produced
via non-conventional additive manufacturing processes. This study introduces a
novel framework that links microstructure informatics with a range of expert
characterization knowledge using customized and hybrid vision-language
representations (VLRs). By integrating deep semantic segmentation with
pre-trained multi-modal models (CLIP and FLAVA), we encode both visual
microstructural data and textual expert assessments into shared
representations. To overcome limitations in general-purpose embeddings, we
develop a customized similarity-based representation that incorporates both
positive and negative references from expert-annotated images and their
associated textual descriptions. This allows zero-shot classification of
previously unseen microstructures through a net similarity scoring approach.
Validation on an additively manufactured metal matrix composite dataset
demonstrates the framework's ability to distinguish between acceptable and
defective samples across a range of characterization criteria. Comparative
analysis reveals that FLAVA model offers higher visual sensitivity, while the
CLIP model provides consistent alignment with the textual criteria. Z-score
normalization adjusts raw unimodal and cross-modal similarity scores based on
their local dataset-driven distributions, enabling more effective alignment and
classification in the hybrid vision-language framework. The proposed method
enhances traceability and interpretability in qualification pipelines by
enabling human-in-the-loop decision-making without task-specific model
retraining. By advancing semantic interoperability between raw data and expert
knowledge, this work contributes toward scalable and domain-adaptable
qualification strategies in engineering informatics.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种基于MedNeXt-L-k5模型的自动化软脑空间分割方法，在T2加权MRI数据上达到了预测与人工分割相当的性能，但在T1加权数据和多中心数据上性能有所下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手动分割软脑空间(PVS)时间消耗大且中间而可靠性低，现有的自动化深度学习模型性能中等且稿性不佳，需要一种能够在多样化数据集上良好稿化的自动化PVS分割方法。

Method: 采用Transformer受启发的3D编码器-解码器卷积网络MedNeXt-L-k5进行自动PVS分割。训练了两个模型：一个使用均质的HCP-Aging T2加权MRI数据，另一个使用来自6台扫描仪的40个异质T1加权MRI数据。通过5折交叉验证和留一个中心交叉验证评估模型性能。

Result: 在HCP-Aging T2加权数据上，模型达到了胶团Dice分数0.88±0.06（白质），与人工分割可靠性相当，为文献中最高水平。在T1加权数据上性能显著下降（Dice 0.58±0.09）。在多中心验证中，胶团层面Dice分别为0.61±0.19（白质）和0.62±0.21（基底节）。

Conclusion: MedNeXt-L-k5提供了一种在异质T1和T2加权MRI数据上进行自动PVS分割的高效方案，但并未超过nnU-Net的性能，表明Transformer模型中的注意力机制对于PVS分割任务的高精度并非必需。

Abstract: Enlarged perivascular spaces (PVS) are increasingly recognized as biomarkers
of cerebral small vessel disease, Alzheimer's disease, stroke, and
aging-related neurodegeneration. However, manual segmentation of PVS is
time-consuming and subject to moderate inter-rater reliability, while existing
automated deep learning models have moderate performance and typically fail to
generalize across diverse clinical and research MRI datasets. We adapted
MedNeXt-L-k5, a Transformer-inspired 3D encoder-decoder convolutional network,
for automated PVS segmentation. Two models were trained: one using a
homogeneous dataset of 200 T2-weighted (T2w) MRI scans from the Human
Connectome Project-Aging (HCP-Aging) dataset and another using 40 heterogeneous
T1-weighted (T1w) MRI volumes from seven studies across six scanners. Model
performance was evaluated using internal 5-fold cross validation (5FCV) and
leave-one-site-out cross validation (LOSOCV). MedNeXt-L-k5 models trained on
the T2w images of the HCP-Aging dataset achieved voxel-level Dice scores of
0.88+/-0.06 (white matter, WM), comparable to the reported inter-rater
reliability of that dataset, and the highest yet reported in the literature.
The same models trained on the T1w images of the HCP-Aging dataset achieved a
substantially lower Dice score of 0.58+/-0.09 (WM). Under LOSOCV, the model had
voxel-level Dice scores of 0.38+/-0.16 (WM) and 0.35+/-0.12 (BG), and
cluster-level Dice scores of 0.61+/-0.19 (WM) and 0.62+/-0.21 (BG).
MedNeXt-L-k5 provides an efficient solution for automated PVS segmentation
across diverse T1w and T2w MRI datasets. MedNeXt-L-k5 did not outperform the
nnU-Net, indicating that the attention-based mechanisms present in
transformer-inspired models to provide global context are not required for high
accuracy in PVS segmentation.

### [11] [Plug-in Feedback Self-adaptive Attention in CLIP for Training-free Open-Vocabulary Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20265)
*Zhixiang Chi,Yanan Wu,Li Gu,Huan Liu,Ziqiang Wang,Yang Zhang,Yang Wang,Konstantinos N. Plataniotis*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需训练、基于反馈的自适应框架，通过将输出级的补丁级对应关系反馈到中间注意力机制，增强CLIP在开放词汇分割中的空间一致性和语义一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CLIP在视觉-文本对齐方面表现强劲，但在开放词汇分割中由于定位能力差而表现不佳。先前的方法通过修改中间注意力来增强空间一致性，但由于后续操作（如投影）导致这种一致性无法持续传播到最终输出，且中间注意力缺乏与文本表示的直接交互。

Method: 设计了一个训练免费、反馈驱动的自适应框架，包括注意力隔离、基于置信度的稀疏适应剪枝和适应集成等关键模块，将输出预测作为更强的空间一致性先验反馈到中间注意力。

Result: 该方法作为即插即用模块，无缝集成到四种最先进方法中，在八个基准测试中一致提升了性能，支持三种骨干网络（ViT-B、ViT-L、ViT-H）和多种注意力类型。

Conclusion: 通过利用模型输出作为空间一致性先验，该方法有效增强了内部表示与最终预测之间的语义一致性，显著提升了开放词汇分割的性能。

Abstract: CLIP exhibits strong visual-textual alignment but struggle with
open-vocabulary segmentation due to poor localization. Prior methods enhance
spatial coherence by modifying intermediate attention. But, this coherence
isn't consistently propagated to the final output due to subsequent operations
such as projections. Additionally, intermediate attention lacks direct
interaction with text representations, such semantic discrepancy limits the
full potential of CLIP.
  In this work, we propose a training-free, feedback-driven self-adaptive
framework that adapts output-based patch-level correspondences back to the
intermediate attention. The output predictions, being the culmination of the
model's processing, encapsulate the most comprehensive visual and textual
semantics about each patch. Our approach enhances semantic consistency between
internal representations and final predictions by leveraging the model's
outputs as a stronger spatial coherence prior. We design key modules, including
attention isolation, confidence-based pruning for sparse adaptation, and
adaptation ensemble, to effectively feedback the output coherence cues. Our
method functions as a plug-in module, seamlessly integrating into four
state-of-the-art approaches with three backbones (ViT-B, ViT-L, ViT-H). We
further validate our framework across multiple attention types (Q-K, self-self,
and Proxy augmented with MAE, SAM, and DINO). Our approach consistently
improves their performance across eight benchmarks.

*Zhuoran Yu,Yong Jae Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个探测框架来系统分析多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在不同层次处理视觉和文本输入的动态过程，发现了模型具有一致的阶段性结构特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在各种视觉语言任务中表现出色，但其内部处理机制仍未被充分探索，需要系统性的分析框架来理解其表示动态。

Method: 训练线性分类器从各层token嵌入中预测细粒度视觉类别，使用标准化锚点问题，并在三种提示变体下评估：词汇变体、语义否定变体和输出格式变体。

Result: 在LLaVA-1.5、LLaVA-Next-LLaMA-3和Qwen2-VL模型中发现一致的阶段性结构：早期层进行视觉基础，中间层支持词汇整合和语义推理，最终层准备任务特定输出。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了MLLMs层次组织的统一视角，并提供了一个轻量级、模型无关的方法来分析多模态表示动态，发现整体阶段性结构稳定但具体层次分配随基础LLM架构变化而显著变化。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated strong performance
across a wide range of vision-language tasks, yet their internal processing
dynamics remain underexplored. In this work, we introduce a probing framework
to systematically analyze how MLLMs process visual and textual inputs across
layers. We train linear classifiers to predict fine-grained visual categories
(e.g., dog breeds) from token embeddings extracted at each layer, using a
standardized anchor question. To uncover the functional roles of different
layers, we evaluate these probes under three types of controlled prompt
variations: (1) lexical variants that test sensitivity to surface-level
changes, (2) semantic negation variants that flip the expected answer by
modifying the visual concept in the prompt, and (3) output format variants that
preserve reasoning but alter the answer format. Applying our framework to
LLaVA-1.5, LLaVA-Next-LLaMA-3, and Qwen2-VL, we identify a consistent
stage-wise structure in which early layers perform visual grounding, middle
layers support lexical integration and semantic reasoning, and final layers
prepare task-specific outputs. We further show that while the overall
stage-wise structure remains stable across variations in visual tokenization,
instruction tuning data, and pretraining corpus, the specific layer allocation
to each stage shifts notably with changes in the base LLM architecture. Our
findings provide a unified perspective on the layer-wise organization of MLLMs
and offer a lightweight, model-agnostic approach for analyzing multimodal
representation dynamics.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出SLiCS方法，通过监督字典学习将视觉-语言联合嵌入空间分解为概念特定的线性子空间，实现更精确的概念过滤图像检索和条件生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉-语言联合嵌入空间（如CLIP）包含丰富的语义信息，但缺乏对复杂场景内容信息的解耦能力。作者假设可以通过将嵌入分解为多个概念特定的组件向量来实现信息解耦。

Method: 采用监督字典学习方法，估计一个线性合成模型，通过稀疏、非负的字典向量组合来匹配多标签信息。使用新颖的交替优化算法保证收敛，并利用文本嵌入进行语义描述和零样本分类。

Result: SLiCS方法在CLIP、TiTok压缩嵌入和DINOv2自监督嵌入上都实现了更精确的概念过滤图像检索，定量和定性结果均显示性能提升。

Conclusion: 稀疏线性概念子空间能够有效解耦联合嵌入空间，为概念过滤的图像检索和条件生成提供了更精确的工具，该方法具有广泛的适用性。

Abstract: Vision-language co-embedding networks, such as CLIP, provide a latent
embedding space with semantic information that is useful for downstream tasks.
We hypothesize that the embedding space can be disentangled to separate the
information on the content of complex scenes by decomposing the embedding into
multiple concept-specific component vectors that lie in different subspaces. We
propose a supervised dictionary learning approach to estimate a linear
synthesis model consisting of sparse, non-negative combinations of groups of
vectors in the dictionary (atoms), whose group-wise activity matches the
multi-label information. Each concept-specific component is a non-negative
combination of atoms associated to a label. The group-structured dictionary is
optimized through a novel alternating optimization with guaranteed convergence.
Exploiting the text co-embeddings, we detail how semantically meaningful
descriptions can be found based on text embeddings of words best approximated
by a concept's group of atoms, and unsupervised dictionary learning can exploit
zero-shot classification of training set images using the text embeddings of
concept labels to provide instance-wise multi-labels. We show that the
disentangled embeddings provided by our sparse linear concept subspaces (SLiCS)
enable concept-filtered image retrieval (and conditional generation using
image-to-prompt) that is more precise. We also apply SLiCS to highly-compressed
autoencoder embeddings from TiTok and the latent embedding from self-supervised
DINOv2. Quantitative and qualitative results highlight the improved precision
of the concept-filtered image retrieval for all embeddings.

TL;DR: MedFoundationHub是一个图形界面工具包，用于安全部署医疗视觉语言模型，解决PHI泄露等安全问题，支持医生无需编程即可使用不同模型，并通过专家评估揭示了当前模型的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗视觉语言模型虽然为临床应用带来机遇，但存在严重的隐私安全风险，如受保护健康信息泄露、数据泄漏和网络威胁漏洞，特别是在医院环境中尤为关键。

Method: 开发MedFoundationHub图形用户界面工具包，支持医生手动选择使用不同模型而无需编程知识，工程师可即插即用部署医疗VLMs，通过Docker编排实现隐私保护推理，仅需配备单个NVIDIA A6000 GPU的本地工作站。

Result: 邀请认证病理学家部署评估5个最先进的VLMs模型，涵盖结肠和肾脏病例，共获得1015个临床医生-模型评分事件，发现模型存在脱靶回答、模糊推理和病理学术语不一致等重复性局限。

Conclusion: MedFoundationHub提供了一个安全、易用的医疗VLMs部署解决方案，但当前模型仍存在显著局限性，需要在保持隐私安全的同时进一步提升模型性能。

Abstract: Recent advances in medical vision-language models (VLMs) open up remarkable
opportunities for clinical applications such as automated report generation,
copilots for physicians, and uncertainty quantification. However, despite their
promise, medical VLMs introduce serious security concerns, most notably risks
of Protected Health Information (PHI) exposure, data leakage, and vulnerability
to cyberthreats - which are especially critical in hospital environments. Even
when adopted for research or non-clinical purposes, healthcare organizations
must exercise caution and implement safeguards. To address these challenges, we
present MedFoundationHub, a graphical user interface (GUI) toolkit that: (1)
enables physicians to manually select and use different models without
programming expertise, (2) supports engineers in efficiently deploying medical
VLMs in a plug-and-play fashion, with seamless integration of Hugging Face
open-source models, and (3) ensures privacy-preserving inference through
Docker-orchestrated, operating system agnostic deployment. MedFoundationHub
requires only an offline local workstation equipped with a single NVIDIA A6000
GPU, making it both secure and accessible within the typical resources of
academic research labs. To evaluate current capabilities, we engaged
board-certified pathologists to deploy and assess five state-of-the-art VLMs
(Google-MedGemma3-4B, Qwen2-VL-7B-Instruct, Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct, and
LLaVA-1.5-7B/13B). Expert evaluation covered colon cases and renal cases,
yielding 1015 clinician-model scoring events. These assessments revealed
recurring limitations, including off-target answers, vague reasoning, and
inconsistent pathology terminology.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多任务密集预测中充分跨任务交互与计算效率之间的权衡问题，现有方法往往在交互完整性和计算效率之间面临取舍

Method: 提出双向交互扫描(BI-Scan)机制构建任务特定的双向序列表示，结合任务优先和位置优先扫描模式；采用多尺度扫描(MS-Scan)机制实现多粒度场景建模

Result: 在NYUD-V2和PASCAL-Context两个基准测试中表现出优于最先进竞争方法的性能

Conclusion: BIM通过创新的扫描机制成功解决了多任务密集预测中的交互-效率权衡问题，为相关研究提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Sufficient cross-task interaction is crucial for success in multi-task dense
prediction. However, sufficient interaction often results in high computational
complexity, forcing existing methods to face the trade-off between interaction
completeness and computational efficiency. To address this limitation, this
work proposes a Bidirectional Interaction Mamba (BIM), which incorporates novel
scanning mechanisms to adapt the Mamba modeling approach for multi-task dense
prediction. On the one hand, we introduce a novel Bidirectional Interaction
Scan (BI-Scan) mechanism, which constructs task-specific representations as
bidirectional sequences during interaction. By integrating task-first and
position-first scanning modes within a unified linear complexity architecture,
BI-Scan efficiently preserves critical cross-task information. On the other
hand, we employ a Multi-Scale Scan~(MS-Scan) mechanism to achieve
multi-granularity scene modeling. This design not only meets the diverse
granularity requirements of various tasks but also enhances nuanced cross-task
feature interactions. Extensive experiments on two challenging benchmarks,
\emph{i.e.}, NYUD-V2 and PASCAL-Context, show the superiority of our BIM vs its
state-of-the-art competitors.

Motivation: 现有的文本指导编辑方法在复杂场景中表达力不足，而音频指导方法通常需要特定数据集训练，限制了其通用性。

Method: 利用预训练的多模态编码器，通过减少音频编码空间与推理模型提示编码空间的差异，并采用分离噪声分支和适应性片选择来处理多模态提示。

Result: 在多样化编辑任务上的完整实验表明，该框架能够通过音频提供丰富信息，在文本方法失败的复杂场景中表现优异。

Conclusion: 该方法为复杂多模态编辑任务提供了一种无需训练的通用解决方案，扩展了可视化编辑的能力。

Abstract: Visual editing with diffusion models has made significant progress but often
struggles with complex scenarios that textual guidance alone could not
adequately describe, highlighting the need for additional non-text editing
prompts. In this work, we introduce a novel audio-guided visual editing
framework that can handle complex editing tasks with multiple text and audio
prompts without requiring additional training. Existing audio-guided visual
editing methods often necessitate training on specific datasets to align audio
with text, limiting their generalization to real-world situations. We leverage
a pre-trained multi-modal encoder with strong zero-shot capabilities and
integrate diverse audio into visual editing tasks, by alleviating the
discrepancy between the audio encoder space and the diffusion model's prompt
encoder space. Additionally, we propose a novel approach to handle complex
scenarios with multiple and multi-modal editing prompts through our separate
noise branching and adaptive patch selection. Our comprehensive experiments on
diverse editing tasks demonstrate that our framework excels in handling
complicated editing scenarios by incorporating rich information from audio,
where text-only approaches fail.

<details>

Motivation: 大规模多标签数据集全标注成本高，部分标注的单正样本多标签学习(SPML)面临偏差和噪音挑战，需要新方法来减少偏差并提高学习效果。

Method: 设计了广义伪标签精强损失(GPR Loss)来学习多样化伪标签并减少噪音，结合动态增强多焦点伪标签(DAMP)技术，构成AEVLP框架。

Result: 在四个标准数据集上进行了广泛实验，证明该框架显著提升了多标签分类性能，达到了最先进水平。

Conclusion: AEVLP框架通过创新的损失函数和伪标签技术，有效解决了SPML中的噪音和偏差问题，为部分标注多标签学习提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Multi-label learning is a challenging computer vision task that requires
assigning multiple categories to each image. However, fully annotating
large-scale datasets is often impractical due to high costs and effort,
motivating the study of learning from partially annotated data. In the extreme
case of Single Positive Multi-Label Learning (SPML), each image is provided
with only one positive label, while all other labels remain unannotated.
Traditional SPML methods that treat missing labels as unknown or negative tend
to yield inaccuracies and false negatives, and integrating various
pseudo-labeling strategies can introduce additional noise. To address these
challenges, we propose the Generalized Pseudo-Label Robust Loss (GPR Loss), a
novel loss function that effectively learns from diverse pseudo-labels while
mitigating noise. Complementing this, we introduce a simple yet effective
Dynamic Augmented Multi-focus Pseudo-labeling (DAMP) technique. Together, these
contributions form the Adaptive and Efficient Vision-Language Pseudo-Labeling
(AEVLP) framework. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets demonstrate
that our framework significantly advances multi-label classification, achieving
state-of-the-art results.

<details>

Motivation: 当前ANN-SNN转换方法在分类任务中表现优异，但在视觉检测任务中性能仍然不理想，主要原因是异质脉冲模式导致的残余膜电位问题。

Method: 采用延迟脉冲方法缓解异质脉冲模式问题，并提出时间依赖的积分发放(tdIF)神经元架构，使IF神经元能够根据时间步长的时序动态调整积累和发放行为。

Conclusion: 所提出的tdIF方法能够以更低的时间步长实现更精确的特征表示，在保持与传统IF神经元相同能耗的同时，实现了高性能和超低延迟的视觉检测。

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), inspired by the brain, are characterized by
minimal power consumption and swift inference capabilities on neuromorphic
hardware, and have been widely applied to various visual perception tasks.
Current ANN-SNN conversion methods have achieved excellent results in
classification tasks with ultra-low time-steps, but their performance in visual
detection tasks remains suboptimal. In this paper, we propose a delay-spike
approach to mitigate the issue of residual membrane potential caused by
heterogeneous spiking patterns. Furthermore, we propose a novel
temporal-dependent Integrate-and-Fire (tdIF) neuron architecture for SNNs. This
enables Integrate-and-fire (IF) neurons to dynamically adjust their
accumulation and firing behaviors based on the temporal order of time-steps.
Our method enables spikes to exhibit distinct temporal properties, rather than
relying solely on frequency-based representations. Moreover, the tdIF neuron
maintains energy consumption on par with traditional IF neuron. We demonstrate
that our method achieves more precise feature representation with lower
time-steps, enabling high performance and ultra-low latency in visual detection
tasks. In this study, we conduct extensive evaluation of the tdIF method across
two critical vision tasks: object detection and lane line detection. The
results demonstrate that the proposed method surpasses current ANN-SNN
conversion approaches, achieving state-of-the-art performance with ultra-low
latency (within 5 time-steps).

TL;DR: 提出DUP-MCRNet网络，通过动态不确定性传播和多模态协同推理解决显著目标检测中的细节丢失、边缘模糊和模态信息融合不足问题，在多个基准数据集上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有显著目标检测方法在复杂场景中容易丢失细节、模糊边缘，且单模态信息融合不足，需要提升对小结构、边缘区域以及多模态信息的处理能力。

Method: 设计动态不确定性图卷积模块(DUGC)通过空间语义距离构建稀疏图传播不确定性；提出多模态协同融合策略(MCF)使用可学习模态门控权重融合RGB、深度和边缘特征；采用多尺度BCE和IoU损失、跨尺度一致性约束和不确定性引导监督机制优化检测性能。

Conclusion: DUP-MCRNet通过动态不确定性传播和多模态协同推理有效提升了显著目标检测的精度和鲁棒性，特别是在处理复杂场景和小结构方面具有优势。

Abstract: In view of the problems that existing salient object detection (SOD) methods
are prone to losing details, blurring edges, and insufficient fusion of
single-modal information in complex scenes, this paper proposes a dynamic
uncertainty propagation and multimodal collaborative reasoning network
(DUP-MCRNet). Firstly, a dynamic uncertainty graph convolution module (DUGC) is
designed to propagate uncertainty between layers through a sparse graph
constructed based on spatial semantic distance, and combined with channel
adaptive interaction, it effectively improves the detection accuracy of small
structures and edge regions. Secondly, a multimodal collaborative fusion
strategy (MCF) is proposed, which uses learnable modality gating weights to
weightedly fuse the attention maps of RGB, depth, and edge features. It can
dynamically adjust the importance of each modality according to different
scenes, effectively suppress redundant or interfering information, and
strengthen the semantic complementarity and consistency between
cross-modalities, thereby improving the ability to identify salient regions
under occlusion, weak texture or background interference. Finally, the
detection performance at the pixel level and region level is optimized through
multi-scale BCE and IoU loss, cross-scale consistency constraints, and
uncertainty-guided supervision mechanisms. Extensive experiments show that
DUP-MCRNet outperforms various SOD methods on most common benchmark datasets,
especially in terms of edge clarity and robustness to complex backgrounds. Our
code is publicly available at https://github.com/YukiBear426/DUP-MCRNet.

Conclusion: 多尺度BEV特征能有效提升多视角行人检测性能，特别是在处理尺度变化问题时表现出色

Abstract: Multi-View Pedestrian Detection (MVPD) aims to detect pedestrians in the form
of a bird's eye view (BEV) from multi-view images. In MVPD, end-to-end
trainable deep learning methods have progressed greatly. However, they often
struggle to detect pedestrians with consistently small or large scales in views
or with vastly different scales between views. This is because they do not
exploit multi-scale image features to generate the BEV feature and detect
pedestrians. To overcome this problem, we propose a novel MVPD method, called
Multi-Scale Multi-View Detection (MSMVD). MSMVD generates multi-scale BEV
features by projecting multi-scale image features extracted from individual
views into the BEV space, scale-by-scale. Each of these BEV features inherits
the properties of its corresponding scale image features from multiple views.
Therefore, these BEV features help the precise detection of pedestrians with
consistently small or large scales in views. Then, MSMVD combines information
at different scales of multiple views by processing the multi-scale BEV
features using a feature pyramid network. This improves the detection of
pedestrians with vastly different scales between views. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that exploiting multi-scale image features via multi-scale BEV
features greatly improves the detection performance, and MSMVD outperforms the
previous highest MODA by $4.5$ points on the GMVD dataset.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of real-time deepfake generation techniques,
forged content is becoming increasingly realistic and widespread across
applications like video conferencing and social media. Although
state-of-the-art detectors achieve high accuracy on standard benchmarks, their
heavy computational cost hinders real-time deployment in practical
applications. To address this, we propose the Spatial-Frequency Aware
Multi-Scale Fusion Network (SFMFNet), a lightweight yet effective architecture
for real-time deepfake detection. We design a spatial-frequency hybrid aware
module that jointly leverages spatial textures and frequency artifacts through
a gated mechanism, enhancing sensitivity to subtle manipulations. A
token-selective cross attention mechanism enables efficient multi-level feature
interaction, while a residual-enhanced blur pooling structure helps retain key
semantic cues during downsampling. Experiments on several benchmark datasets
show that SFMFNet achieves a favorable balance between accuracy and efficiency,
with strong generalization and practical value for real-time applications.

Conclusion: 该方法通过结合双模型权重选择咈自我知识萌荐，有效克服了传统方法在缩减模型时丢失关键信息的问题，为医学图像分析领域提供了高效的轻量级解决方案

Abstract: We propose a novel medical image classification method that integrates
dual-model weight selection with self-knowledge distillation (SKD). In
real-world medical settings, deploying large-scale models is often limited by
computational resource constraints, which pose significant challenges for their
practical implementation. Thus, developing lightweight models that achieve
comparable performance to large-scale models while maintaining computational
efficiency is crucial. To address this, we employ a dual-model weight selection
strategy that initializes two lightweight models with weights derived from a
large pretrained model, enabling effective knowledge transfer. Next, SKD is
applied to these selected models, allowing the use of a broad range of initial
weight configurations without imposing additional excessive computational cost,
followed by fine-tuning for the target classification tasks. By combining
dual-model weight selection with self-knowledge distillation, our method
overcomes the limitations of conventional approaches, which often fail to
retain critical information in compact models. Extensive experiments on
publicly available datasets-chest X-ray images, lung computed tomography scans,
and brain magnetic resonance imaging scans-demonstrate the superior performance
and robustness of our approach compared to existing methods.

Conclusion: 通过集成几何重稠密化和跨尺度特征传播模块，该方法产生了紧凑的特征表示，提供了高效的上下文建模并加速了编码过程，解决了LiDAR点云压缩中的稀疏性挑战。

Abstract: LiDAR point clouds are fundamental to various applications, yet
high-precision scans incur substantial storage and transmission overhead.
Existing methods typically convert unordered points into hierarchical octree or
voxel structures for dense-to-sparse predictive coding. However, the extreme
sparsity of geometric details hinders efficient context modeling, thereby
limiting their compression performance and speed. To address this challenge, we
propose to generate compact features for efficient predictive coding. Our
framework comprises two lightweight modules. First, the Geometry
Re-Densification Module re-densifies encoded sparse geometry, extracts features
at denser scale, and then re-sparsifies the features for predictive coding.
This module avoids costly computation on highly sparse details while
maintaining a lightweight prediction head. Second, the Cross-scale Feature
Propagation Module leverages occupancy cues from multiple resolution levels to
guide hierarchical feature propagation. This design facilitates information
sharing across scales, thereby reducing redundant feature extraction and
providing enriched features for the Geometry Re-Densification Module. By
integrating these two modules, our method yields a compact feature
representation that provides efficient context modeling and accelerates the
coding process. Experiments on the KITTI dataset demonstrate state-of-the-art
compression ratios and real-time performance, achieving 26 FPS for both
encoding and decoding at 12-bit quantization. Code is available at

Abstract: Scaling laws have validated the success and promise of large-data-trained
models in creative generation across text, image, and video domains. However,
this paradigm faces data scarcity in the 3D domain, as there is far less of it
available on the internet compared to the aforementioned modalities.
Fortunately, there exist adequate videos that inherently contain commonsense
priors, offering an alternative supervisory signal to mitigate the
generalization bottleneck caused by limited native 3D data. On the one hand,
videos capturing multiple views of an object or scene provide a spatial
consistency prior for 3D generation. On the other hand, the rich semantic
information contained within the videos enables the generated content to be
more faithful to the text prompts and semantically plausible. This paper
explores how to apply the video modality in 3D asset generation, spanning
datasets to models. We introduce Droplet3D-4M, the first large-scale video
dataset with multi-view level annotations, and train Droplet3D, a generative
model supporting both image and dense text input. Extensive experiments
validate the effectiveness of our approach, demonstrating its ability to
produce spatially consistent and semantically plausible content. Moreover, in
contrast to the prevailing 3D solutions, our approach exhibits the potential
for extension to scene-level applications. This indicates that the commonsense
priors from the videos significantly facilitate 3D creation. We have
open-sourced all resources including the dataset, code, technical framework,

Abstract: Corner cases are crucial for training and validating autonomous driving
systems, yet collecting them from the real world is often costly and hazardous.
Editing objects within captured sensor data offers an effective alternative for
generating diverse scenarios, commonly achieved through 3D Gaussian Splatting
or image generative models. However, these approaches often suffer from limited
visual fidelity or imprecise pose control. To address these issues, we propose
G^2Editor, a framework designed for photorealistic and precise object editing
in driving videos. Our method leverages a 3D Gaussian representation of the
edited object as a dense prior, injected into the denoising process to ensure
accurate pose control and spatial consistency. A scene-level 3D bounding box
layout is employed to reconstruct occluded areas of non-target objects.
Furthermore, to guide the appearance details of the edited object, we
incorporate hierarchical fine-grained features as additional conditions during
generation. Experiments on the Waymo Open Dataset demonstrate that G^2Editor
effectively supports object repositioning, insertion, and deletion within a
unified framework, outperforming existing methods in both pose controllability
and visual quality, while also benefiting downstream data-driven tasks.

TL;DR: 通过病理知识领域随机化策略，从健康数据生成合成数据来解决胎儿脑分割中稀缺病理注释的问题，在胺胶体发育不良症上取得显著改善效果


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 胎儿脑部精确分割对评估神经发育至关重要，但胺胶体发育不良症(CCD)等稀缺病理的注释数据不足限制了深度学习模型的普遍化能力

Method: 提出病理知识领域随机化策略，将CCD表现的先验知识嵌入合成数据生成流程，仅使用健康数据模拟多样的脑部变化

Result: 在248例健康胎儿、26例CCD和47例其他脑部病理的群体中验证，CCD案例分割效果显著提升，胺胶体长度估计误差从10.9mm降至0.7mm，同时保持对其他病理的性能

Conclusion: 将领域特定的解剖先验知识结合到合成数据流程中，可有效缓解数据稀缺问题，提高对稀缺但临床重要病变的分析能力

Abstract: Accurate fetal brain segmentation is crucial for extracting biomarkers and
assessing neurodevelopment, especially in conditions such as corpus callosum
dysgenesis (CCD), which can induce drastic anatomical changes. However, the
rarity of CCD severely limits annotated data, hindering the generalization of
deep learning models. To address this, we propose a pathology-informed domain
randomization strategy that embeds prior knowledge of CCD manifestations into a
synthetic data generation pipeline. By simulating diverse brain alterations
from healthy data alone, our approach enables robust segmentation without
requiring pathological annotations.
  We validate our method on a cohort comprising 248 healthy fetuses, 26 with
CCD, and 47 with other brain pathologies, achieving substantial improvements on
CCD cases while maintaining performance on both healthy fetuses and those with
other pathologies. From the predicted segmentations, we derive clinically
relevant biomarkers, such as corpus callosum length (LCC) and volume, and show
their utility in distinguishing CCD subtypes. Our pathology-informed
augmentation reduces the LCC estimation error from 1.89 mm to 0.80 mm in
healthy cases and from 10.9 mm to 0.7 mm in CCD cases. Beyond these
quantitative gains, our approach yields segmentations with improved topological
consistency relative to available ground truth, enabling more reliable
shape-based analyses. Overall, this work demonstrates that incorporating
domain-specific anatomical priors into synthetic data pipelines can effectively
mitigate data scarcity and enhance analysis of rare but clinically significant
malformations.

TL;DR: 首个统一框架，能够处理手语、唇部动作和音频组合，为聋听障碍人士提供更好的语音识别方案


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ASR系统对聋听障碍人士无法使用，而手语识别和唇读技术通常单独研究，需要统一框架来整合多模态输入

Method: 设计了一个统一的模态无关的架构，能够有效处理异构输入，明确将唇部动作建模为独立模态

Result: 在SLT、VSR、ASR和AVSR任务上达到或超过了专门化的最新模型性能，明确建模唇部动作显著提升了手语翻译性能

Conclusion: 多模态整合框架为聋听障碍人士提供了更全面的通信解决方案，唇部动作作为非手势索引在手语理解中具有重要作用

Abstract: Audio is the primary modality for human communication and has driven the
success of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) technologies. However, such
systems remain inherently inaccessible to individuals who are deaf or hard of
hearing. Visual alternatives such as sign language and lip reading offer
effective substitutes, and recent advances in Sign Language Translation (SLT)
and Visual Speech Recognition (VSR) have improved audio-less communication.
Yet, these modalities have largely been studied in isolation, and their
integration within a unified framework remains underexplored. In this paper, we
introduce the first unified framework capable of handling diverse combinations
of sign language, lip movements, and audio for spoken-language text generation.
We focus on three main objectives: (i) designing a unified, modality-agnostic
architecture capable of effectively processing heterogeneous inputs; (ii)
exploring the underexamined synergy among modalities, particularly the role of
lip movements as non-manual cues in sign language comprehension; and (iii)
achieving performance on par with or superior to state-of-the-art models
specialized for individual tasks. Building on this framework, we achieve
performance on par with or better than task-specific state-of-the-art models
across SLT, VSR, ASR, and AVSR. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that
explicitly modeling lip movements as a separate modality significantly improves
SLT performance.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Video-MTR是一个强化多轮推理框架，通过迭代选择关键视频片段和问题理解来解决长视频理解问题，采用门控双级奖励系统实现端到端训练，在多个基准测试中达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 长视频理解存在长程时间依赖和多个事件的挑战，现有方法依赖静态推理或外部视觉语言模型，存在复杂度高和端到端训练不足导致的性能不佳问题。

Method: 提出强化多轮推理框架，迭代选择视频片段并基于先前处理片段的理解进行渐进推理；引入门控双级奖励系统，结合轨迹级奖励（答案正确性）和轮级奖励（帧-查询相关性），优化视频片段选择和问题理解。

Result: 在VideoMME、MLVU和EgoSchema等基准测试中，Video-MTR在准确性和效率方面均优于现有方法，推进了长视频理解的技术水平。

Conclusion: Video-MTR通过多轮迭代推理和门控双级奖励系统，有效解决了长视频理解的挑战，无需外部视觉语言模型即可实现端到端训练，取得了state-of-the-art的性能。

Abstract: Long-form video understanding, characterized by long-range temporal
dependencies and multiple events, remains a challenge. Existing methods often
rely on static reasoning or external visual-language models (VLMs), which face
issues like complexity and sub-optimal performance due to the lack of
end-to-end training. In this paper, we propose Video-MTR, a reinforced
multi-turn reasoning framework designed to enable iterative key video segment
selection and question comprehension. Unlike traditional video reasoning
pipeline, which generate predictions in a single turn, Video-MTR performs
reasoning in multiple turns, selecting video segments progressively based on
the evolving understanding of previously processed segments and the current
question. This iterative process allows for a more refined and contextually
aware analysis of the video. To ensure intermediate reasoning process, we
introduce a novel gated bi-level reward system, combining trajectory-level
rewards based on answer correctness and turn-level rewards emphasizing
frame-query relevance. This system optimizes both video segment selection and
question comprehension, eliminating the need for external VLMs and allowing
end-to-end training. Extensive experiments on benchmarks like VideoMME, MLVU,
and EgoSchema demonstrate that Video-MTR outperforms existing methods in both
accuracy and efficiency, advancing the state-of-the-art in long video
understanding.

TL;DR: DUO是一个针对单目3D目标检测的测试时自适应框架，通过联合优化语义不确定性和几何不确定性来提高模型在域偏移下的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的测试时自适应方法虽然认识到低不确定性与高泛化能力之间的正相关关系，但未能解决单目3D目标检测中固有的双重不确定性问题：语义不确定性（模糊的类别预测）和几何不确定性（不稳定的空间定位）。

Method: 提出了双重不确定性优化（DUO）框架，包括：1）通过凸优化视角创新性地构建焦点损失的凸结构，并推导出无监督版本，实现标签无关的不确定性加权和高不确定性对象的平衡学习；2）设计语义感知的法向量场约束，在具有清晰语义线索的区域保持几何一致性；3）建立双分支互补机制，增强的空间感知改善语义分类，鲁棒的语义预测进一步优化空间理解。

Result: 大量实验证明DUO在各种数据集和域偏移类型上都优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DUO是首个专门针对单目3D目标检测设计的测试时自适应框架，通过联合最小化语义和几何不确定性，显著提高了模型在真实世界域偏移下的鲁棒性和可靠性。

Abstract: Accurate monocular 3D object detection (M3OD) is pivotal for safety-critical
applications like autonomous driving, yet its reliability deteriorates
significantly under real-world domain shifts caused by environmental or sensor
variations. To address these shifts, Test-Time Adaptation (TTA) methods have
emerged, enabling models to adapt to target distributions during inference.
While prior TTA approaches recognize the positive correlation between low
uncertainty and high generalization ability, they fail to address the dual
uncertainty inherent to M3OD: semantic uncertainty (ambiguous class
predictions) and geometric uncertainty (unstable spatial localization). To
bridge this gap, we propose Dual Uncertainty Optimization (DUO), the first TTA
framework designed to jointly minimize both uncertainties for robust M3OD.
Through a convex optimization lens, we introduce an innovative convex structure
of the focal loss and further derive a novel unsupervised version, enabling
label-agnostic uncertainty weighting and balanced learning for high-uncertainty
objects. In parallel, we design a semantic-aware normal field constraint that
preserves geometric coherence in regions with clear semantic cues, reducing
uncertainty from the unstable 3D representation. This dual-branch mechanism
forms a complementary loop: enhanced spatial perception improves semantic
classification, and robust semantic predictions further refine spatial
understanding. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of DUO over
existing methods across various datasets and domain shift types.

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have led to more studies to enhance golfers'
shot precision. However, these existing studies have not quantitatively
established the relationship between swing posture and ball trajectory,
limiting their ability to provide golfers with the necessary insights for swing
improvement. In this paper, we propose a new dataset called CaddieSet, which
includes joint information and various ball information from a single shot.
CaddieSet extracts joint information from a single swing video by segmenting it
into eight swing phases using a computer vision-based approach. Furthermore,
based on expert golf domain knowledge, we define 15 key metrics that influence
a golf swing, enabling the interpretation of swing outcomes through
swing-related features. Through experiments, we demonstrated the feasibility of
CaddieSet for predicting ball trajectories using various benchmarks. In
particular, we focus on interpretable models among several benchmarks and
verify that swing feedback using our joint features is quantitatively
consistent with established domain knowledge. This work is expected to offer
new insight into golf swing analysis for both academia and the sports industry.

Result: 在MVTec 3D-AD数据集上实现了新的最先进性能，显著降低了误报率

Conclusion: IAENet通过有效整合2D和3D专家模型的知识，提升了工业表面异常检测的实用价值

Abstract: Surface anomaly detection is pivotal for ensuring product quality in
industrial manufacturing. While 2D image-based methods have achieved remarkable
success, 3D point cloud-based detection remains underexplored despite its
richer geometric cues. We argue that the key bottleneck is the absence of
powerful pretrained foundation backbones in 3D comparable to those in 2D. To
bridge this gap, we propose Importance-Aware Ensemble Network (IAENet), an
ensemble framework that synergizes 2D pretrained expert with 3D expert models.
However, naively fusing predictions from disparate sources is non-trivial:
existing strategies can be affected by a poorly performing modality and thus
degrade overall accuracy. To address this challenge, We introduce an novel
Importance-Aware Fusion (IAF) module that dynamically assesses the contribution
of each source and reweights their anomaly scores. Furthermore, we devise
critical loss functions that explicitly guide the optimization of IAF, enabling
it to combine the collective knowledge of the source experts but also preserve
their unique strengths, thereby enhancing the overall performance of anomaly
detection. Extensive experiments on MVTec 3D-AD demonstrate that our IAENet
achieves a new state-of-the-art with a markedly lower false positive rate,
underscoring its practical value for industrial deployment.

Motivation: 解决文本到图像生成中语义图像编辑的挑战，避免基于反转算法引入重建误差，克服基于指令模型受限于数据集质量和规模的问题。

Method: 提出DescriptiveEdit框架，采用交叉注意力UNet结构，在参考图像和提示词输入的基础上，通过注意力桥接机制将参考图像特征注入到编辑图像生成过程中。

Conclusion: 该方法成功将指令式图像编辑转化为基于参考图像的文本到图像生成，保留了训练良好的文本到图像模型的生成能力，无需架构修改或反转操作。

Abstract: Despite the progress in text-to-image generation, semantic image editing
remains a challenge. Inversion-based algorithms unavoidably introduce
reconstruction errors, while instruction-based models mainly suffer from
limited dataset quality and scale. To address these problems, we propose a
descriptive-prompt-based editing framework, named DescriptiveEdit. The core
idea is to re-frame `instruction-based image editing' as `reference-image-based
text-to-image generation', which preserves the generative power of well-trained
Text-to-Image models without architectural modifications or inversion.
Specifically, taking the reference image and a prompt as input, we introduce a
Cross-Attentive UNet, which newly adds attention bridges to inject reference
image features into the prompt-to-edit-image generation process. Owing to its
text-to-image nature, DescriptiveEdit overcomes limitations in instruction
dataset quality, integrates seamlessly with ControlNet, IP-Adapter, and other
extensions, and is more scalable. Experiments on the Emu Edit benchmark show it
improves editing accuracy and consistency.

TL;DR: DCFS是一个新颖的持续测试时适应框架，通过双路径特征一致性和置信度感知样本学习来解决伪标签质量问题和误差累积问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在无法访问源域数据的情况下，现有方法依赖模型预测生成伪标签，但伪标签质量无法保证且存在误差累积问题，需要解决这些挑战。

Method: 使用双分类器将目标数据的整体特征表示解耦为语义相关特征和域相关特征，通过保持子特征与整体特征的一致性来多角度捕捉数据特征，并设置自适应阈值进行置信度加权的自监督学习。

Result: 在CIFAR10-C、CIFAR100-C和ImageNet-C等多个数据集上的广泛实验验证了该方法的有效性，在持续测试时适应场景中表现出稳定的性能。

Conclusion: DCFS框架通过特征解耦和一致性约束，结合置信度感知学习，有效减少了伪标签噪声并缓解了误差累积问题，为持续测试时适应提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Continual test-time adaptation aims to continuously adapt a pre-trained model
to a stream of target domain data without accessing source data. Without access
to source domain data, the model focuses solely on the feature characteristics
of the target data. Relying exclusively on these features can lead to confusion
and introduce learning biases. Currently, many existing methods generate
pseudo-labels via model predictions. However, the quality of pseudo-labels
cannot be guaranteed and the problem of error accumulation must be solved. To
address these challenges, we propose DCFS, a novel CTTA framework that
introduces dual-path feature consistency and confidence-aware sample learning.
This framework disentangles the whole feature representation of the target data
into semantic-related feature and domain-related feature using dual classifiers
to learn distinct feature representations. By maintaining consistency between
the sub-features and the whole feature, the model can comprehensively capture
data features from multiple perspectives. Additionally, to ensure that the
whole feature information of the target domain samples is not overlooked, we
set a adaptive threshold and calculate a confidence score for each sample to
carry out loss weighted self-supervised learning, effectively reducing the
noise of pseudo-labels and alleviating the problem of error accumulation. The
efficacy of our proposed method is validated through extensive experimentation
across various datasets, including CIFAR10-C, CIFAR100-C, and ImageNet-C,
demonstrating consistent performance in continual test-time adaptation
scenarios.

Motivation: 摄像机标定质量对新视角合成至关重要，1像素错误就会对重建质量产生显著影响，而真实场景缺乏真实标定数据

Method: 使用3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)模型，通过新视角颜色损失的反向传播来微调摄像机参数

Result: 在标准数据集上平均提升了0.4dB PSNR，对于Mip-NeRF 360等参考场景的标定有显著改善

Conclusion: 虽然微调过程可能耗时，但对于新视角质量要求极高的参考场景标定，该方法具有重要价值

Abstract: The quality of the camera calibration is of major importance for evaluating
progresses in novel view synthesis, as a 1-pixel error on the calibration has a
significant impact on the reconstruction quality. While there is no ground
truth for real scenes, the quality of the calibration is assessed by the
quality of the novel view synthesis. This paper proposes to use a 3DGS model to
fine tune calibration by backpropagation of novel view color loss with respect
to the cameras parameters. The new calibration alone brings an average
improvement of 0.4 dB PSNR on the dataset used as reference by 3DGS. The fine
tuning may be long and its suitability depends on the criticity of training
time, but for calibration of reference scenes, such as Mip-NeRF 360, the stake
of novel view quality is the most important.

Conclusion: 所提出的动态多模态样本选择框架有效解决了医学图像分割中的标注成本问题，为主动域适应提供了新的解决方案

Abstract: Accurate gross tumor volume segmentation on multi-modal medical data is
critical for radiotherapy planning in nasopharyngeal carcinoma and
glioblastoma. Recent advances in deep neural networks have brought promising
results in medical image segmentation, leading to an increasing demand for
labeled data. Since labeling medical images is time-consuming and
labor-intensive, active learning has emerged as a solution to reduce annotation
costs by selecting the most informative samples to label and adapting
high-performance models with as few labeled samples as possible. Previous
active domain adaptation (ADA) methods seek to minimize sample redundancy by
selecting samples that are farthest from the source domain. However, such
one-off selection can easily cause negative transfer, and access to source
medical data is often limited. Moreover, the query strategy for multi-modal
medical data remains unexplored. In this work, we propose an active and
sequential domain adaptation framework for dynamic multi-modal sample selection
in ADA. We derive a query strategy to prioritize labeling and training on the
most valuable samples based on their informativeness and representativeness.
Empirical validation on diverse gross tumor volume segmentation tasks
demonstrates that our method achieves favorable segmentation performance,
significantly outperforming state-of-the-art ADA methods. Code is available at

Conclusion: 该方法通过数据级融合有效利用了RGB图像和LiDAR数据的互补特性，显著提升了无监督3D物体检测的性能，为解决3D标签缺乏问题提供了有效方案

Abstract: Existing LiDAR-based 3D object detectors typically rely on manually annotated
labels for training to achieve good performance. However, obtaining
high-quality 3D labels is time-consuming and labor-intensive. To address this
issue, recent works explore unsupervised 3D object detection by introducing RGB
images as an auxiliary modal to assist pseudo-box generation. However, these
methods simply integrate pseudo-boxes generated by LiDAR point clouds and RGB
images. Yet, such a label-level fusion strategy brings limited improvements to
the quality of pseudo-boxes, as it overlooks the complementary nature in terms
of LiDAR and RGB image data. To overcome the above limitations, we propose a
novel data-level fusion framework that integrates RGB images and LiDAR data at
an early stage. Specifically, we utilize vision foundation models for instance
segmentation and depth estimation on images and introduce a bi-directional
fusion method, where real points acquire category labels from the 2D space,
while 2D pixels are projected onto 3D to enhance real point density. To
mitigate noise from depth and segmentation estimations, we propose a local and
global filtering method, which applies local radius filtering to suppress depth
estimation errors and global statistical filtering to remove
segmentation-induced outliers. Furthermore, we propose a data-level fusion
based dynamic self-evolution strategy, which iteratively refines pseudo-boxes
under a dense representation, significantly improving localization accuracy.
Extensive experiments on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate that the detector
trained by our method significantly outperforms that trained by previous
state-of-the-art methods with 28.4$\%$ mAP on the nuScenes validation
benchmark.

Abstract: Estimating Body Mass Index (BMI) from camera images with machine learning
models enables rapid weight assessment when traditional methods are unavailable
or impractical, such as in telehealth or emergency scenarios. Existing computer
vision approaches have been limited to datasets of up to 14,500 images. In this
study, we present a deep learning-based BMI estimation method trained on our
WayBED dataset, a large proprietary collection of 84,963 smartphone images from
25,353 individuals. We introduce an automatic filtering method that uses
posture clustering and person detection to curate the dataset by removing
low-quality images, such as those with atypical postures or incomplete views.
This process retained 71,322 high-quality images suitable for training. We
achieve a Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of 7.9% on our hold-out test
set (WayBED data) using full-body images, the lowest value in the published
literature to the best of our knowledge. Further, we achieve a MAPE of 13% on
the completely unseen~(during training) VisualBodyToBMI dataset, comparable
with state-of-the-art approaches trained on it, demonstrating robust
generalization. Lastly, we fine-tune our model on VisualBodyToBMI and achieve a
MAPE of 8.56%, the lowest reported value on this dataset so far. We deploy the
full pipeline, including image filtering and BMI estimation, on Android devices
using the CLAID framework. We release our complete code for model training,
filtering, and the CLAID package for mobile deployment as open-source

Motivation: 现有域适应技术研究多集中于自然图像，对医学图像关注不足，且主流数据集可能导致性能偏差。为更好理解域适应在自然和医学图像中的效益，需要进行系统性评估。

Method: 使用7种广泛应用的域适应技术，在5个自然图像和8个医学图像数据集上进行557个模拟实验，涵盖分布外、动态数据流和有限训练样本等多种场景。

Result: DSAN算法表现突出，在COVID-19数据集上使用Resnet50达到91.2%的分类准确率，在动态数据流场景中相比基线提升6.7%，且在COVID-19和皮肤癌数据集上展现出良好的可解释性。

Conclusion: 研究结果深化了对域适应技术的理解，为模型在医学数据上的有效适应提供了宝贵见解，DSAN算法在医学图像分类中具有显著优势。

Abstract: Domain adaptation (DA) techniques have the potential in machine learning to
alleviate distribution differences between training and test sets by leveraging
information from source domains. In image classification, most advances in DA
have been made using natural images rather than medical data, which are harder
to work with. Moreover, even for natural images, the use of mainstream datasets
can lead to performance bias. {With the aim of better understanding the
benefits of DA for both natural and medical images, this study performs 557
simulation studies using seven widely-used DA techniques for image
classification in five natural and eight medical datasets that cover various
scenarios, such as out-of-distribution, dynamic data streams, and limited
training samples.} Our experiments yield detailed results and insightful
observations highlighting the performance and medical applicability of these
techniques. Notably, our results have shown the outstanding performance of the
Deep Subdomain Adaptation Network (DSAN) algorithm. This algorithm achieved
feasible classification accuracy (91.2\%) in the COVID-19 dataset using

### [39] [Contrastive Learning through Auxiliary Branch for Video Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20551)
*Lucas Rakotoarivony*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出CLAB方法，通过对比学习辅助分支和动态损失权重策略，在不增加推理计算成本的情况下提升视频目标检测性能，在ImageNet VID数据集上达到SOTA效果


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频目标检测面临运动模糊、遮挡等图像退化问题，现有方法通常需要特征聚合和复杂后处理，但计算成本较高。希望在不增加推理计算负担的情况下提升对图像退化的鲁棒性

Method: 1) 使用对比损失实现对比学习辅助分支，增强主干网络特征表示能力；2) 提出动态损失权重策略，训练初期侧重辅助特征学习，后期逐渐转向检测任务

Result: 在ImageNet VID数据集上，ResNet-101达到84.0% mAP，ResNeXt-101达到85.2% mAP，实现了CNN模型的最优性能且无需额外后处理

Conclusion: CLAB方法简单有效，通过对比学习和动态权重策略显著提升了视频目标检测性能，在保持推理效率的同时达到了state-of-the-art水平

Abstract: Video object detection is a challenging task because videos often suffer from
image deterioration such as motion blur, occlusion, and deformable shapes,
making it significantly more difficult than detecting objects in still images.
Prior approaches have improved video object detection performance by employing
feature aggregation and complex post-processing techniques, though at the cost
of increased computational demands. To improve robustness to image degradation
without additional computational load during inference, we introduce a
straightforward yet effective Contrastive Learning through Auxiliary Branch
(CLAB) method. First, we implement a constrastive auxiliary branch using a
contrastive loss to enhance the feature representation capability of the video
object detector's backbone. Next, we propose a dynamic loss weighting strategy
that emphasizes auxiliary feature learning early in training while gradually
prioritizing the detection task as training converges. We validate our approach
through comprehensive experiments and ablation studies, demonstrating
consistent performance gains. Without bells and whistles, CLAB reaches a
performance of 84.0% mAP and 85.2% mAP with ResNet-101 and ResNeXt-101,
respectively, on the ImageNet VID dataset, thus achieving state-of-the-art
performance for CNN-based models without requiring additional post-processing
methods.

*Lorenz Hufe,Constantin Venhoff,Maximilian Dreyer,Sebastian Lapuschkin,Wojciech Samek*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文分析了CLIP视觉编码器在排版攻击下的行为，发现特定注意力头负责提取排版信息，提出了一种无需微调的防御方法，通过选择性消融注意力头电路来提升模型对排版攻击的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 排版攻击通过向图像中注入文本来操纵多模态系统，导致目标错误分类、恶意内容生成和视觉语言模型越狱。需要研究CLIP模型在这种攻击下的行为并开发有效的防御方法。

Method: 定位CLIP模型后半层中专门提取和传输排版信息的注意力头，构建排版电路，通过选择性消融这些注意力头来防御排版攻击，无需微调。

Result: 该方法在排版版ImageNet-100上性能提升高达19.6%，标准ImageNet-100准确率下降不到1%。无需训练的防御方法与当前依赖微调的最先进方法竞争力相当。

Conclusion: 发布了一系列抗排版攻击的dyslexic CLIP模型，这些模型可作为安全关键应用的即插即用替代方案，在文本识别效用与文本操纵风险之间取得更好平衡。

Abstract: Typographic attacks exploit multi-modal systems by injecting text into
images, leading to targeted misclassifications, malicious content generation
and even Vision-Language Model jailbreaks. In this work, we analyze how CLIP
vision encoders behave under typographic attacks, locating specialized
attention heads in the latter half of the model's layers that causally extract
and transmit typographic information to the cls token. Building on these
insights, we introduce a method to defend CLIP models against typographic
attacks by selectively ablating a typographic circuit, consisting of attention
heads. Without requiring finetuning, our method improves performance by up to
19.6% on a typographic variant of ImageNet-100, while reducing standard
ImageNet-100 accuracy by less than 1%. Notably, our training-free approach
remains competitive with current state-of-the-art typographic defenses that
rely on finetuning. To this end, we release a family of dyslexic CLIP models
which are significantly more robust against typographic attacks. These models
serve as suitable drop-in replacements for a broad range of safety-critical
applications, where the risks of text-based manipulation outweigh the utility
of text recognition.

Conclusion: 商图的区域级嵌入有助于提升预测性能，图神经网络为面部表情识别提供了有效的结构化学习方法

Abstract: Facial expression recognition (FER) is a crucial task in computer vision with
wide range of applications including human computer interaction, surveillance,
and assistive technologies. However, challenges such as occlusion, expression
variability, and lack of interpretability hinder the performance of traditional
FER systems. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) offer a powerful alternative by
modeling relational dependencies between facial landmarks, enabling structured
and interpretable learning. In this paper, we propose GLaRE, a novel
Graph-based Landmark Region Embedding network for emotion recognition. Facial
landmarks are extracted using 3D facial alignment, and a quotient graph is
constructed via hierarchical coarsening to preserve spatial structure while
reducing complexity. Our method achieves 64.89 percentage accuracy on AffectNet
and 94.24 percentage on FERG, outperforming several existing baselines.
Additionally, ablation studies have demonstrated that region-level embeddings
from quotient graphs have contributed to improved prediction performance.

Motivation: 解决当前虚拟试穿技术面临的两个主要挑战：无法支持多参考服装组合（包括服装和配件），以及由于在去噪步骤中重复计算参考特征导致的显著低效率

Method: 提出基于可缓存扩散架构的FastFit框架，采用半注意力机制，用类别嵌入替代传统时间步嵌入，实现参考特征编码与去噪过程的完全解耦，参考特征只需计算一次即可在所有步骤中无损复用

Result: 在VITON-HD、DressCode和新建的DressCode-MR数据集上的广泛实验表明，FastFit在关键保真度指标上超越最先进方法，同时提供显著的推理效率优势，平均实现3.5倍加速

Conclusion: FastFit通过创新的缓存架构成功解决了多参考虚拟试穿的效率和功能限制问题，为复杂多参考虚拟试穿研究提供了有效解决方案和高质量数据集支持

Abstract: Despite its great potential, virtual try-on technology is hindered from
real-world application by two major challenges: the inability of current
methods to support multi-reference outfit compositions (including garments and
accessories), and their significant inefficiency caused by the redundant
re-computation of reference features in each denoising step. To address these
challenges, we propose FastFit, a high-speed multi-reference virtual try-on
framework based on a novel cacheable diffusion architecture. By employing a
Semi-Attention mechanism and substituting traditional timestep embeddings with
class embeddings for reference items, our model fully decouples reference
feature encoding from the denoising process with negligible parameter overhead.
This allows reference features to be computed only once and losslessly reused
across all steps, fundamentally breaking the efficiency bottleneck and
achieving an average 3.5x speedup over comparable methods. Furthermore, to
facilitate research on complex, multi-reference virtual try-on, we introduce
DressCode-MR, a new large-scale dataset. It comprises 28,179 sets of
high-quality, paired images covering five key categories (tops, bottoms,
dresses, shoes, and bags), constructed through a pipeline of expert models and
human feedback refinement. Extensive experiments on the VITON-HD, DressCode,
and our DressCode-MR datasets show that FastFit surpasses state-of-the-art
methods on key fidelity metrics while offering its significant advantage in
inference efficiency.

Result: 在真实场景数据集上验证，在交通标志描绘质量和感知层检测精度方面表现出优越性能

Conclusion: UTA-Sign方法有效解决了低光照环境下交通标志感知的挑战，为自动驾驶系统提供了更准确的环境语义理解

Abstract: The thermal camera excels at perceiving outdoor environments under low-light
conditions, making it ideal for applications such as nighttime autonomous
driving and unmanned navigation. However, thermal cameras encounter challenges
when capturing signage from objects made of similar materials, which can pose
safety risks for accurately understanding semantics in autonomous driving
systems. In contrast, the neuromorphic vision camera, also known as an event
camera, detects changes in light intensity asynchronously and has proven
effective in high-speed, low-light traffic environments. Recognizing the
complementary characteristics of these two modalities, this paper proposes
UTA-Sign, an unsupervised thermal-event video augmentation for traffic signage
in low-illumination environments, targeting elements such as license plates and
roadblock indicators. To address the signage blind spots of thermal imaging and
the non-uniform sampling of event cameras, we developed a dual-boosting
mechanism that fuses thermal frames and event signals for consistent signage
representation over time. The proposed method utilizes thermal frames to
provide accurate motion cues as temporal references for aligning the uneven
event signals. At the same time, event signals contribute subtle signage
content to the raw thermal frames, enhancing the overall understanding of the
environment. The proposed method is validated on datasets collected from
real-world scenarios, demonstrating superior quality in traffic signage
sketching and improved detection accuracy at the perceptual level.

Result: 在CelebA-HQ和LFW数据集上实验，显著降低了面部替换效果，提高了防御成功率，同时保持了良好的视觉质量

Conclusion: 该主动防御方法能够有效干扰深度伪造生成过程，为对抗GAN驱动的深度伪造攻击提供了新的解决方案

Abstract: Deepfake technology, driven by Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), poses
significant risks to privacy and societal security. Existing detection methods
are predominantly passive, focusing on post-event analysis without preventing
attacks. To address this, we propose an active defense method based on
low-frequency perceptual perturbations to disrupt face swapping manipulation,
reducing the performance and naturalness of generated content. Unlike prior
approaches that used low-frequency perturbations to impact classification
accuracy,our method directly targets the generative process of deepfake
techniques. We combine frequency and spatial domain features to strengthen
defenses. By introducing artifacts through low-frequency perturbations while
preserving high-frequency details, we ensure the output remains visually
plausible. Additionally, we design a complete architecture featuring an
encoder, a perturbation generator, and a decoder, leveraging discrete wavelet
transform (DWT) to extract low-frequency components and generate perturbations
that disrupt facial manipulation models. Experiments on CelebA-HQ and LFW
demonstrate significant reductions in face-swapping effectiveness, improved
defense success rates, and preservation of visual quality.

Abstract: Generating 3D human motions from text is a challenging yet valuable task. The
key aspects of this task are ensuring text-motion consistency and achieving
generation diversity. Although recent advancements have enabled the generation
of precise and high-quality human motions from text, achieving diversity in the
generated motions remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we aim to
overcome the above challenge by designing a simple yet effective text-to-motion
generation method, \textit{i.e.}, Diverse-T2M. Our method introduces
uncertainty into the generation process, enabling the generation of highly
diverse motions while preserving the semantic consistency of the text.
Specifically, we propose a novel perspective that utilizes noise signals as
carriers of diversity information in transformer-based methods, facilitating a
explicit modeling of uncertainty. Moreover, we construct a latent space where
text is projected into a continuous representation, instead of a rigid
one-to-one mapping, and integrate a latent space sampler to introduce
stochastic sampling into the generation process, thereby enhancing the
diversity and uncertainty of the outputs. Our results on text-to-motion
generation benchmark datasets~(HumanML3D and KIT-ML) demonstrate that our
method significantly enhances diversity while maintaining state-of-the-art
performance in text consistency.

Abstract: Intraoperative ultrasound images are inherently challenging to interpret in
liver surgery due to the limited field of view and complex anatomical
structures. Bridging the gap between preoperative and intraoperative data is
crucial for effective surgical guidance. 3D IntraVascular UltraSound (IVUS)
offers a potential solution by enabling the reconstruction of the entire organ,
which facilitates registration between preoperative computed tomography (CT)
scans and intraoperative IVUS images. In this work, we propose an
optimization-based calibration method using a 3D-printed phantom for accurate
3D Intravascular Ultrasound volume reconstruction. Our approach ensures precise
alignment of tracked IVUS data with preoperative CT images, improving
intraoperative navigation. We validated our method using in vivo swine liver
images, achieving a calibration error from 0.88 to 1.80 mm and a registration
error from 3.40 to 5.71 mm between the 3D IVUS data and the corresponding CT
scan. Our method provides a reliable and accurate means of calibration and
volume reconstruction. It can be used to register intraoperative ultrasound
images with preoperative CT images in the context of liver surgery, and enhance
intraoperative guidance.

Abstract: In semiconductor manufacturing, defect detection and localization are
critical to ensuring product quality and yield. While X-ray imaging is a
reliable non-destructive testing method, it is memory-intensive and
time-consuming for large-scale scanning, Magnetic Field Imaging (MFI) offers a
more efficient means to localize regions of interest (ROI) for targeted X-ray
scanning. However, the limited availability of MFI datasets due to proprietary
concerns presents a significant bottleneck for training machine learning (ML)
models using MFI. To address this challenge, we consider an ML-driven approach
leveraging diffusion models with two physical constraints. We propose Physics
Informed Generative Models for Magnetic Field Images (PI-GenMFI) to generate
synthetic MFI samples by integrating specific physical information. We generate
MFI images for the most common defect types: power shorts. These synthetic
images will serve as training data for ML algorithms designed to localize
defect areas efficiently. To evaluate generated MFIs, we compare our model to
SOTA generative models from both variational autoencoder (VAE) and diffusion
methods. We present a domain expert evaluation to assess the generated samples.
In addition, we present qualitative and quantitative evaluation using various
metrics used for image generation and signal processing, showing promising
results to optimize the defect localization process.

Conclusion: 该方法能够更有效地利用分开推理中的中间特征来恢复敏感数据，显示了当前半半协作推理模式的隐私风险

Abstract: The growing complexity of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) has led to the adoption
of Split Inference (SI), a collaborative paradigm that partitions computation
between edge devices and the cloud to reduce latency and protect user privacy.
However, recent advances in Data Reconstruction Attacks (DRAs) reveal that
intermediate features exchanged in SI can be exploited to recover sensitive
input data, posing significant privacy risks. Existing DRAs are typically
effective only on shallow models and fail to fully leverage semantic priors,
limiting their reconstruction quality and generalizability across datasets and
model architectures. In this paper, we propose a novel GAN-based DRA framework
with Progressive Feature Optimization (PFO), which decomposes the generator
into hierarchical blocks and incrementally refines intermediate representations
to enhance the semantic fidelity of reconstructed images. To stabilize the
optimization and improve image realism, we introduce an L1-ball constraint
during reconstruction. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms
prior attacks by a large margin, especially in high-resolution scenarios,
out-of-distribution settings, and against deeper and more complex DNNs.

Abstract: Emotional talking head synthesis aims to generate talking portrait videos
with vivid expressions. Existing methods still exhibit limitations in control
flexibility, motion naturalness, and expression quality. Moreover, currently
available datasets are primarily collected in lab settings, further
exacerbating these shortcomings. Consequently, these limitations substantially
hinder practical applications in real-world scenarios. To address these
challenges, we propose EmoCAST, a diffusion-based framework with two key
modules for precise text-driven emotional synthesis. In appearance modeling,
emotional prompts are integrated through a text-guided decoupled emotive
module, enhancing the spatial knowledge to improve emotion comprehension. To
improve the relationship between audio and emotion, we introduce an emotive
audio attention module to capture the interplay between controlled emotion and
driving audio, generating emotion-aware features to guide more precise facial
motion synthesis. Additionally, we construct an emotional talking head dataset
with comprehensive emotive text descriptions to optimize the framework's
performance. Based on the proposed dataset, we propose an emotion-aware
sampling training strategy and a progressive functional training strategy that
further improve the model's ability to capture nuanced expressive features and
achieve accurate lip-synchronization. Overall, EmoCAST achieves
state-of-the-art performance in generating realistic, emotionally expressive,

acquired on scanners from multiple vendors at both 1.5 T and 3 T. Each study
was labeled for the left and right breast as no lesion, benign lesion, or
malignant lesion. We developed a SwinUNETR-based deep learning framework that
incorporates breast region masking, extensive data augmentation, and ensemble
learning to improve robustness and generalizability. Our method achieved second

TL;DR: AvatarBack是一个用于3D高斯头像重建的即插即用框架，通过生成身份一致的后视图伪图像和自适应空间对齐策略，解决了现有方法因依赖前视图图像而导致后头部重建质量差的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于高斯泼溅的头像重建方法主要依赖前视图图像，导致后头部区域重建质量差，出现几何不一致、结构模糊和真实感降低等问题，限制了重建头像的保真度。

Method: 提出了AvatarBack框架，包含两个核心技术：1）特定主体生成器（SSG）利用生成先验从稀疏前视图输入合成身份一致的后视图伪图像；2）自适应空间对齐策略（ASA）使用可学习的变换矩阵在训练过程中优化，实现合成视图与3D高斯表示之间的精确几何对齐。

Conclusion: AvatarBack通过显式建模缺失的后头部区域，成功解决了3D高斯头像重建中的后头部质量问题，为构建完整且一致的3D高斯头像提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in Gaussian Splatting have significantly boosted the
reconstruction of head avatars, enabling high-quality facial modeling by
representing an 3D avatar as a collection of 3D Gaussians. However, existing
methods predominantly rely on frontal-view images, leaving the back-head poorly
constructed. This leads to geometric inconsistencies, structural blurring, and
reduced realism in the rear regions, ultimately limiting the fidelity of
reconstructed avatars. To address this challenge, we propose AvatarBack, a
novel plug-and-play framework specifically designed to reconstruct complete and
consistent 3D Gaussian avatars by explicitly modeling the missing back-head
regions. AvatarBack integrates two core technical innovations,i.e., the
Subject-specific Generator (SSG) and the Adaptive Spatial Alignment Strategy
(ASA). The former leverages a generative prior to synthesize
identity-consistent, plausible back-view pseudo-images from sparse frontal
inputs, providing robust multi-view supervision. To achieve precise geometric
alignment between these synthetic views and the 3D Gaussian representation, the
later employs learnable transformation matrices optimized during training,
effectively resolving inherent pose and coordinate discrepancies. Extensive
experiments on NeRSemble and K-hairstyle datasets, evaluated using geometric,
photometric, and GPT-4o-based perceptual metrics, demonstrate that AvatarBack
significantly enhances back-head reconstruction quality while preserving
frontal fidelity. Moreover, the reconstructed avatars maintain consistent
visual realism under diverse motions and remain fully animatable.

perform well on photographs, they struggle with paintings due to domain shift
and high intra-class variation. Artistic factors such as style, skill, intent,
and influence from other works further complicate recognition. In this work, we
investigate the potential of foundation models to improve facial recognition in
artworks. By fine-tuning foundation models and integrating their embeddings
with those from conventional facial recognition networks, we demonstrate
notable improvements over current state-of-the-art methods. Our results show
that foundation models can bridge the gap where traditional methods are
ineffective. Paper page at https://www.idiap.ch/paper/artface/

*Ayan Banerjee,Fernando Vilariño,Josep Lladós*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CraftGraffiti是一个端到端的文本引导涂鸦生成框架，通过LoRA微调扩散变换器和面部一致性自注意力机制，在极端风格转换中保持面部身份识别性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决涂鸦艺术中极端风格转换导致面部身份识别性丧失的问题，保持个人和文化真实性。

Method: 采用"风格优先，身份后处理"范式：1）LoRA微调预训练扩散变换器进行风格迁移；2）面部一致性自注意力机制增强身份嵌入；3）CLIP引导提示扩展实现无关键点的姿态定制。

Result: 在面部特征一致性方面表现优异，获得最先进的美学和人类偏好评分，在Cruilla音乐节现场部署展示了实际创意影响力。

Conclusion: CraftGraffiti推进了身份尊重的AI辅助艺术目标，为创意AI应用中平衡风格自由度和可识别性提供了原则性方法。

Abstract: Preserving facial identity under extreme stylistic transformation remains a
major challenge in generative art. In graffiti, a high-contrast, abstract
medium, subtle distortions to the eyes, nose, or mouth can erase the subject's
recognizability, undermining both personal and cultural authenticity. We
present CraftGraffiti, an end-to-end text-guided graffiti generation framework
designed with facial feature preservation as a primary objective. Given an
input image and a style and pose descriptive prompt, CraftGraffiti first
applies graffiti style transfer via LoRA-fine-tuned pretrained diffusion
transformer, then enforces identity fidelity through a face-consistent
self-attention mechanism that augments attention layers with explicit identity
embeddings. Pose customization is achieved without keypoints, using CLIP-guided
prompt extension to enable dynamic re-posing while retaining facial coherence.
We formally justify and empirically validate the "style-first, identity-after"
paradigm, showing it reduces attribute drift compared to the reverse order.
Quantitative results demonstrate competitive facial feature consistency and
state-of-the-art aesthetic and human preference scores, while qualitative
analyses and a live deployment at the Cruilla Festival highlight the system's
real-world creative impact. CraftGraffiti advances the goal of
identity-respectful AI-assisted artistry, offering a principled approach for
blending stylistic freedom with recognizability in creative AI applications.

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新的自我评估方法，通过生成偏见自我判断分数来改善大型视觉-语言模型的对齐效果，减少幻觉现象和提升安全性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的模态对齐方法依赖外部数据集、人工标注或复杂的后处理，导致扩展性不高和成本增加。需要一种无需外部资源的自主改进方案。

Method: 提出生成偏见自我判断分数，这是一种由模型内部创建的自我评估指标，无需依赖外部资源。该方法改善了解码策略和偏好调整过程。

Result: 实验结果显示，该方法在减少幻觉现象、提升安全性和改善整体能力方面显著超过传统方法。

Conclusion: 该研究为大型视觉-语言模型的对齐提供了更有效的解决方案，通过自主自我评估实现了更好的多模态整合效果。

Abstract: The rapid advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large
Visual-Language Models (LVLMs) have opened up new opportunities for integrating
visual and linguistic modalities. However, effectively aligning these
modalities remains challenging, often leading to hallucinations--where
generated outputs are not grounded in the visual input--and raising safety
concerns across various domains. Existing alignment methods, such as
instruction tuning and preference tuning, often rely on external datasets,
human annotations, or complex post-processing, which limit scalability and
increase costs. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach that
generates the debiased self-judgment score, a self-evaluation metric created
internally by the model without relying on external resources. This enables the
model to autonomously improve alignment. Our method enhances both decoding
strategies and preference tuning processes, resulting in reduced
hallucinations, enhanced safety, and improved overall capability. Empirical
results show that our approach significantly outperforms traditional methods,
offering a more effective solution for aligning LVLMs.

Result: MobileCLIP2在ImageNet-1k零样本准确率上取得显著提升，MobileCLIP2-B比MobileCLIP-B提升2.2%，MobileCLIP2-S4在2倍更小模型尺寸下达到SigLIP-SO400M/14的准确率，延迟降低2.5倍。

Conclusion: MobileCLIP2通过改进的训练方法和数据生成技术，在保持低延迟的同时实现了最先进的零样本性能，为移动设备上的图像-文本模型提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Foundation image-text models such as CLIP with zero-shot capabilities enable
a wide array of applications. MobileCLIP is a recent family of image-text
models at 3-15ms latency and 50-150M parameters with state-of-the-art zero-shot
accuracy. The main ingredients in MobileCLIP were its low-latency and light
architectures and a novel multi-modal reinforced training that made knowledge
distillation from multiple caption-generators and CLIP teachers efficient,
scalable, and reproducible. In this paper, we improve the multi-modal
reinforced training of MobileCLIP through: 1) better CLIP teacher ensembles
trained on the DFN dataset, 2) improved captioner teachers trained on the DFN
dataset and fine-tuned on a diverse selection of high-quality image-caption
datasets. We discover new insights through ablations such as the importance of
temperature tuning in contrastive knowledge distillation, the effectiveness of
caption-generator fine-tuning for caption diversity, and the additive
improvement from combining synthetic captions generated by multiple models. We
train a new family of models called MobileCLIP2 and achieve state-of-the-art
ImageNet-1k zero-shot accuracies at low latencies. In particular, we observe
2.2% improvement in ImageNet-1k accuracy for MobileCLIP2-B compared with
MobileCLIP-B architecture. Notably, MobileCLIP2-S4 matches the zero-shot
accuracy of SigLIP-SO400M/14 on ImageNet-1k while being 2$\times$ smaller and
improves on DFN ViT-L/14 at 2.5$\times$ lower latency. We release our
pretrained models (https://github.com/apple/ml-mobileclip) and the data
generation code (https://github.com/apple/ml-mobileclip-dr). The data
generation code makes it easy to create new reinforced datasets with arbitrary
teachers using distributed scalable processing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态AI研究主要关注检测合成内容和上下文不一致内容，但忽视了AI生成图像背后的意图识别，需要填补这一研究空白。

Method: 构建S-HArM数据集（9576个真实社交媒体图像-文本对），探索三种提示策略（图像引导、描述引导、多模态引导）用Stable Diffusion构建大规模合成训练数据，比较多种模型架构包括模态融合、对比学习、重建网络、注意力机制和大规模视觉语言模型。

Result: 图像引导和多模态引导的合成训练数据由于保留了视觉上下文，能更好地泛化到真实内容。但整体性能仍然有限，表明推断意图的复杂性。

Conclusion: 识别AI生成图像意图具有挑战性，需要专门的架构设计，当前方法在泛化性能上仍有提升空间。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal AI have enabled progress in detecting synthetic
and out-of-context content. However, existing efforts largely overlook the
intent behind AI-generated images. To fill this gap, we introduce S-HArM, a
multimodal dataset for intent-aware classification, comprising 9,576 "in the
wild" image-text pairs from Twitter/X and Reddit, labeled as Humor/Satire, Art,
or Misinformation. Additionally, we explore three prompting strategies
(image-guided, description-guided, and multimodally-guided) to construct a
large-scale synthetic training dataset with Stable Diffusion. We conduct an
extensive comparative study including modality fusion, contrastive learning,
reconstruction networks, attention mechanisms, and large vision-language
models. Our results show that models trained on image- and multimodally-guided
data generalize better to "in the wild" content, due to preserved visual
context. However, overall performance remains limited, highlighting the
complexity of inferring intent and the need for specialized architectures.

Result: 在基准数据集上的广泛实验验证了C3-GS实现了最先进的渲染质量和泛化能力

Conclusion: 该方法能够在不需额外监督的情况下实现照片级真实感合成，代码已开源

Abstract: Generalizable Gaussian Splatting aims to synthesize novel views for unseen
scenes without per-scene optimization. In particular, recent advancements
utilize feed-forward networks to predict per-pixel Gaussian parameters,
enabling high-quality synthesis from sparse input views. However, existing
approaches fall short in encoding discriminative, multi-view consistent
features for Gaussian predictions, which struggle to construct accurate
geometry with sparse views. To address this, we propose $\mathbf{C}^{3}$-GS, a
framework that enhances feature learning by incorporating context-aware,
cross-dimension, and cross-scale constraints. Our architecture integrates three
lightweight modules into a unified rendering pipeline, improving feature fusion
and enabling photorealistic synthesis without requiring additional supervision.
Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets validate that $\mathbf{C}^{3}$-GS
achieves state-of-the-art rendering quality and generalization ability. Code is

Motivation: 解决神经视频压缩中精确比特率控制的挑战，满足变比特率场景的应用需求

Method: 提出动态路由自编码器（DRA）和速率控制代理，采用联合路由优化策略进行协同训练

Result: 在HEVC和UVG数据集上平均BD-Rate降低14.8%，BD-PSNR增益0.47dB，平均比特率误差仅1.66%

Conclusion: 该方法实现了速率-失真-复杂度优化（RDCO），适用于各种比特率和比特率受限的应用场景

Abstract: Neural Video Compression (NVC) has achieved remarkable performance in recent
years. However, precise rate control remains a challenge due to the inherent
limitations of learning-based codecs. To solve this issue, we propose a dynamic
video compression framework designed for variable bitrate scenarios. First, to
achieve variable bitrate implementation, we propose the Dynamic-Route
Autoencoder with variable coding routes, each occupying partial computational
complexity of the whole network and navigating to a distinct RD trade-off.
Second, to approach the target bitrate, the Rate Control Agent estimates the
bitrate of each route and adjusts the coding route of DRA at run time. To
encompass a broad spectrum of variable bitrates while preserving overall RD
performance, we employ the Joint-Routes Optimization strategy, achieving
collaborative training of various routes. Extensive experiments on the HEVC and
UVG datasets show that the proposed method achieves an average BD-Rate
reduction of 14.8% and BD-PSNR gain of 0.47dB over state-of-the-art methods
while maintaining an average bitrate error of 1.66%, achieving
Rate-Distortion-Complexity Optimization (RDCO) for various bitrate and

TL;DR: CardioMorphNet是一个基于循环贝叶斯深度学习的3D心脏形状引导形变配准框架，通过分割图配准而非传统强度相似性损失来更准确估计心脏运动，并在UK Biobank数据集上表现出优越性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有心脏运动估计方法依赖基于强度的图像配准相似性损失，往往忽略心脏解剖区域，导致运动捕捉不准确。需要一种能够专注于解剖区域的更精确方法。

Method: 提出循环变分自编码器建模心动周期时空依赖性，使用两个后验模型分别进行双心室分割和运动估计。通过贝叶斯推导的损失函数递归配准分割图，避免使用基于强度的相似性损失。

Result: 在UK Biobank数据集上验证显示，CardioMorphNet在心脏运动估计方面优于最先进方法，且能计算运动场的不确定性图，在心脏区域产生更低的不确定性值。

Conclusion: CardioMorphNet通过形状引导的配准方法和贝叶斯建模，实现了更准确的心脏运动估计和更高置信度的预测，为心脏功能评估提供了可靠工具。

Abstract: Accurate cardiac motion estimation from cine cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR)
images is vital for assessing cardiac function and detecting its abnormalities.
Existing methods often struggle to capture heart motion accurately because they
rely on intensity-based image registration similarity losses that may overlook
cardiac anatomical regions. To address this, we propose CardioMorphNet, a
recurrent Bayesian deep learning framework for 3D cardiac shape-guided
deformable registration using short-axis (SAX) CMR images. It employs a
recurrent variational autoencoder to model spatio-temporal dependencies over
the cardiac cycle and two posterior models for bi-ventricular segmentation and
motion estimation. The derived loss function from the Bayesian formulation
guides the framework to focus on anatomical regions by recursively registering
segmentation maps without using intensity-based image registration similarity
loss, while leveraging sequential SAX volumes and spatio-temporal features. The
Bayesian modelling also enables computation of uncertainty maps for the
estimated motion fields. Validated on the UK Biobank dataset by comparing
warped mask shapes with ground truth masks, CardioMorphNet demonstrates
superior performance in cardiac motion estimation, outperforming
state-of-the-art methods. Uncertainty assessment shows that it also yields
lower uncertainty values for estimated motion fields in the cardiac region
compared with other probabilistic-based cardiac registration methods,
indicating higher confidence in its predictions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的零样本3D视觉定位方法存在空间推理受限、上下文遗漏和细节退化等问题，需要消除场景特定训练需求以实现更好的现实世界应用。

Method: 首先通过3D语义分割网络生成3D实例提案并进行语义过滤，然后使用提案引导的多视角投影策略将候选提案投影到真实场景图像序列中，最后通过动态调度机制迭代处理序列查询提示，利用VLM的跨模态推理能力识别文本指定的对象。

Result: 在ScanRefer和Nr3D基准测试中分别达到55.6%和53.2%的Acc@0.25分数，比之前的零样本方法分别提升了4.0%和5.2%。

Conclusion: SeqVLM框架显著提升了3D视觉定位的泛化能力和现实世界适用性，推动了该领域的发展。

Abstract: 3D Visual Grounding (3DVG) aims to localize objects in 3D scenes using
natural language descriptions. Although supervised methods achieve higher
accuracy in constrained settings, zero-shot 3DVG holds greater promise for
real-world applications since eliminating scene-specific training requirements.
However, existing zero-shot methods face challenges of spatial-limited
reasoning due to reliance on single-view localization, and contextual omissions
or detail degradation. To address these issues, we propose SeqVLM, a novel
zero-shot 3DVG framework that leverages multi-view real-world scene images with
spatial information for target object reasoning. Specifically, SeqVLM first
generates 3D instance proposals via a 3D semantic segmentation network and
refines them through semantic filtering, retaining only semantic-relevant
candidates. A proposal-guided multi-view projection strategy then projects
these candidate proposals onto real scene image sequences, preserving spatial
relationships and contextual details in the conversion process of 3D point
cloud to images. Furthermore, to mitigate VLM computational overload, we
implement a dynamic scheduling mechanism that iteratively processes
sequances-query prompts, leveraging VLM's cross-modal reasoning capabilities to
identify textually specified objects. Experiments on the ScanRefer and Nr3D
benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance, achieving Acc@0.25 scores
of 55.6% and 53.2%, surpassing previous zero-shot methods by 4.0% and 5.2%,
respectively, which advance 3DVG toward greater generalization and real-world
applicability. The code is available at https://github.com/JiawLin/SeqVLM.

Conclusion: 该方法推理开销可忽略，仅需粗粒度域元数据，提供强大且平衡的性能，是MIDOG 2025挑战赛的有竞争力方案

Abstract: Atypical mitotic figures (AMFs) are important histopathological markers yet
remain challenging to identify consistently, particularly under domain shift
stemming from scanner, stain, and acquisition differences. We present a simple
training-time recipe for domain-robust AMF classification in MIDOG 2025 Task 2.
The approach (i) increases feature diversity via style perturbations inserted
at early and mid backbone stages, (ii) aligns attention-refined features across
sites using weak domain labels (Scanner, Origin, Species, Tumor) through an
auxiliary alignment loss, and (iii) stabilizes predictions by distilling from
an exponential moving average (EMA) teacher with temperature-scaled KL
divergence. On the organizer-run preliminary leaderboard for atypical mitosis
classification, our submission attains balanced accuracy of 0.8762, sensitivity
of 0.8873, specificity of 0.8651, and ROC AUC of 0.9499. The method incurs
negligible inference-time overhead, relies only on coarse domain metadata, and
delivers strong, balanced performance, positioning it as a competitive

Method: 使用18类军事车辆自定义数据集，通过不同遮挡百分比评估CLIP变体的性能，采用归一化曲线下面积(NAUC)作为评估指标

Result: Transformer-based CLIP优于CNN；细粒度分散遮挡比大块连续遮挡影响更大；线性探测模型在35%遮挡时性能骤降；微调后性能下降点延迟到60%遮挡

Conclusion: 需要在训练中加入遮挡特定增强，进一步研究补丁级敏感性和架构韧性，以提高CLIP在真实军事部署中的实用性

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) like CLIP enable zero-shot classification by
aligning images and text in a shared embedding space, offering advantages for
defense applications with scarce labeled data. However, CLIP's robustness in
challenging military environments, with partial occlusion and degraded
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), remains underexplored. We investigate CLIP
variants' robustness to occlusion using a custom dataset of 18 military vehicle
classes and evaluate using Normalized Area Under the Curve (NAUC) across
occlusion percentages. Four key insights emerge: (1) Transformer-based CLIP
models consistently outperform CNNs, (2) fine-grained, dispersed occlusions
degrade performance more than larger contiguous occlusions, (3) despite
improved accuracy, performance of linear-probed models sharply drops at around
35% occlusion, (4) by finetuning the model's backbone, this performance drop
occurs at more than 60% occlusion. These results underscore the importance of
occlusion-specific augmentations during training and the need for further
exploration into patch-level sensitivity and architectural resilience for
real-world deployment of CLIP.

Conclusion: Pref-GRPO通过偏好拟合替代分数最大化，实现了更稳定的T2I生成训练；UniGenBench为全面模型评估提供了精细的基准测试框架

Abstract: Recent advancements highlight the importance of GRPO-based reinforcement
learning methods and benchmarking in enhancing text-to-image (T2I) generation.
However, current methods using pointwise reward models (RM) for scoring
generated images are susceptible to reward hacking. We reveal that this happens
when minimal score differences between images are amplified after
normalization, creating illusory advantages that drive the model to
over-optimize for trivial gains, ultimately destabilizing the image generation
process. To address this, we propose Pref-GRPO, a pairwise preference
reward-based GRPO method that shifts the optimization objective from score
maximization to preference fitting, ensuring more stable training. In
Pref-GRPO, images are pairwise compared within each group using preference RM,
and the win rate is used as the reward signal. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that PREF-GRPO differentiates subtle image quality differences,
providing more stable advantages and mitigating reward hacking. Additionally,
existing T2I benchmarks are limited by coarse evaluation criteria, hindering
comprehensive model assessment. To solve this, we introduce UniGenBench, a
unified T2I benchmark comprising 600 prompts across 5 main themes and 20
subthemes. It evaluates semantic consistency through 10 primary and 27
sub-criteria, leveraging MLLM for benchmark construction and evaluation. Our
benchmarks uncover the strengths and weaknesses of both open and closed-source
T2I models and validate the effectiveness of Pref-GRPO.

Abstract: Focusing on the development of an end-to-end autonomous vehicle model with
pixel-to-pixel context awareness, this research proposes the SKGE-Swin
architecture. This architecture utilizes the Swin Transformer with a skip-stage
mechanism to broaden feature representation globally and at various network
levels. This approach enables the model to extract information from distant
pixels by leveraging the Swin Transformer's Shifted Window-based Multi-head
Self-Attention (SW-MSA) mechanism and to retain critical information from the
initial to the final stages of feature extraction, thereby enhancing its
capability to comprehend complex patterns in the vehicle's surroundings. The
model is evaluated on the CARLA platform using adversarial scenarios to
simulate real-world conditions. Experimental results demonstrate that the
SKGE-Swin architecture achieves a superior Driving Score compared to previous
methods. Furthermore, an ablation study will be conducted to evaluate the
contribution of each architectural component, including the influence of skip
connections and the use of the Swin Transformer, in improving model
performance.

Abstract: The automatic understanding of video content is advancing rapidly. Empowered
by deeper neural networks and large datasets, machines are increasingly capable
of understanding what is concretely visible in video frames, whether it be
objects, actions, events, or scenes. In comparison, humans retain a unique
ability to also look beyond concrete entities and recognize abstract concepts
like justice, freedom, and togetherness. Abstract concept recognition forms a
crucial open challenge in video understanding, where reasoning on multiple
semantic levels based on contextual information is key. In this paper, we argue
that the recent advances in foundation models make for an ideal setting to
address abstract concept understanding in videos. Automated understanding of
high-level abstract concepts is imperative as it enables models to be more
aligned with human reasoning and values. In this survey, we study different
tasks and datasets used to understand abstract concepts in video content. We
observe that, periodically and over a long period, researchers have attempted
to solve these tasks, making the best use of the tools available at their
disposal. We advocate that drawing on decades of community experience will help
us shed light on this important open grand challenge and avoid ``re-inventing
the wheel'' as we start revisiting it in the era of multi-modal foundation
models.

Motivation: 虽然皮肤病变分类模型的准确性已经超过皮肤科医生，但医学实践中对AI模型的不信任仍是挑战。现有的可解释性方法存在可靠性问题，需要更可信、可解释的诊断方法。

Method: 全局类激活概率地图评估，通过概率化和像素级分析所有类别的激活概率地图，统一可视化诊断过程。结合SafeML检测假诊断并发出警报。

Abstract: Recent advancements in skin lesion classification models have significantly
improved accuracy, with some models even surpassing dermatologists' diagnostic
performance. However, in medical practice, distrust in AI models remains a
challenge. Beyond high accuracy, trustworthy, explainable diagnoses are
essential. Existing explainability methods have reliability issues, with
LIME-based methods suffering from inconsistency, while CAM-based methods
failing to consider all classes. To address these limitations, we propose
Global Class Activation Probabilistic Map Evaluation, a method that analyses
all classes' activation probability maps probabilistically and at a pixel
level. By visualizing the diagnostic process in a unified manner, it helps
reduce the risk of misdiagnosis. Furthermore, the application of SafeML
enhances the detection of false diagnoses and issues warnings to doctors and
patients as needed, improving diagnostic reliability and ultimately patient
safety. We evaluated our method using the ISIC datasets with MobileNetV2 and
Vision Transformers.

### [67] [Evaluating Compositional Generalisation in VLMs and Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20783)
*Beth Pearson,Bilal Boulbarss,Michael Wray,Martha Lewis*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文比较了扩散分类器、CLIP和ViLT在组合泛化能力上的表现，发现扩散分类器和ViLT在概念绑定任务上表现良好，但所有模型在关系推理任务上都存在显著困难。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自然语言语义的一个基本方面是能够从已知部分组合出新含义。虽然视觉语言模型(VLMs)取得了显著进展，但有证据表明它们在组合泛化方面存在困难，比如无法正确绑定属性和关系。

Method: 评估三种模型（扩散分类器、CLIP和ViLT）在零样本学习(ZSL)和广义零样本学习(GZSL)设置下绑定对象属性和关系的能力，并分析CLIP嵌入表示。

Result: 扩散分类器和ViLT在概念绑定任务上表现良好，但所有模型在关系GZSL任务上都显著困难。CLIP嵌入分析表明困难可能源于关系概念（如左右）的表示过于相似。

Conclusion: 扩散分类器在组合泛化方面相比判别式模型有所改进，但视觉语言模型在关系推理方面仍面临广泛挑战，需要更好的关系概念表示方法。

Abstract: A fundamental aspect of the semantics of natural language is that novel
meanings can be formed from the composition of previously known parts.
Vision-language models (VLMs) have made significant progress in recent years,
however, there is evidence that they are unable to perform this kind of
composition. For example, given an image of a red cube and a blue cylinder, a
VLM such as CLIP is likely to incorrectly label the image as a red cylinder or
a blue cube, indicating it represents the image as a `bag-of-words' and fails
to capture compositional semantics. Diffusion models have recently gained
significant attention for their impressive generative abilities, and zero-shot
classifiers based on diffusion models have been shown to perform competitively
with CLIP in certain compositional tasks. In this work we explore whether the
generative Diffusion Classifier has improved compositional generalisation
abilities compared to discriminative models. We assess three models --
Diffusion Classifier, CLIP, and ViLT -- on their ability to bind objects with
attributes and relations in both zero-shot learning (ZSL) and generalised
zero-shot learning (GZSL) settings. Our results show that the Diffusion
Classifier and ViLT perform well at concept binding tasks, but that all models
struggle significantly with the relational GZSL task, underscoring the broader
challenges VLMs face with relational reasoning. Analysis of CLIP embeddings
suggests that the difficulty may stem from overly similar representations of
relational concepts such as left and right. Code and dataset are available at:

Conclusion: 提出的面元位姿学习回归方法能够有效处理点云配准中的方向和不确定性问题，在真实点云扫描数据上表现出强大的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Point cloud registration is crucial for ensuring 3D alignment consistency of
multiple local point clouds in 3D reconstruction for remote sensing or digital
heritage. While various point cloud-based registration methods exist, both
non-learning and learning-based, they ignore point orientations and point
uncertainties, making the model susceptible to noisy input and aggressive
rotations of the input point cloud like orthogonal transformation; thus, it
necessitates extensive training point clouds with transformation augmentations.
To address these issues, we propose a novel surfel-based pose learning
regression approach. Our method can initialize surfels from Lidar point cloud
using virtual perspective camera parameters, and learns explicit
$\mathbf{SE(3)}$ equivariant features, including both position and rotation
through $\mathbf{SE(3)}$ equivariant convolutional kernels to predict relative
transformation between source and target scans. The model comprises an
equivariant convolutional encoder, a cross-attention mechanism for similarity
computation, a fully-connected decoder, and a non-linear Huber loss.
Experimental results on indoor and outdoor datasets demonstrate our model
superiority and robust performance on real point-cloud scans compared to
state-of-the-art methods.

Abstract: Simulating detector responses is a crucial part of understanding the inner
workings of particle collisions in the Large Hadron Collider at CERN. Such
simulations are currently performed with statistical Monte Carlo methods, which
are computationally expensive and put a significant strain on CERN's
computational grid. Therefore, recent proposals advocate for generative machine
learning methods to enable more efficient simulations. However, the
distribution of the data varies significantly across the simulations, which is
hard to capture with out-of-the-box methods. In this study, we present
ExpertSim - a deep learning simulation approach tailored for the Zero Degree
Calorimeter in the ALICE experiment. Our method utilizes a
Mixture-of-Generative-Experts architecture, where each expert specializes in
simulating a different subset of the data. This allows for a more precise and
efficient generation process, as each expert focuses on a specific aspect of
the calorimeter response. ExpertSim not only improves accuracy, but also
provides a significant speedup compared to the traditional Monte-Carlo methods,
offering a promising solution for high-efficiency detector simulations in
particle physics experiments at CERN. We make the code available at

Conclusion: 该方法通过显式因果推理实现了更透明和逻辑一致的推理，CCE可作为跨领域可复用的因果推理引擎

Abstract: Existing Causal-Why Video Question Answering (VideoQA) models often struggle
with higher-order reasoning, relying on opaque, monolithic pipelines that
entangle video understanding, causal inference, and answer generation. These
black-box approaches offer limited interpretability and tend to depend on
shallow heuristics. We propose a novel, modular framework that explicitly
decouples causal reasoning from answer generation, introducing natural language
causal chains as interpretable intermediate representations. Inspired by human
cognitive models, these structured cause-effect sequences bridge low-level
video content with high-level causal reasoning, enabling transparent and
logically coherent inference. Our two-stage architecture comprises a Causal
Chain Extractor (CCE) that generates causal chains from video-question pairs,
and a Causal Chain-Driven Answerer (CCDA) that produces answers grounded in
these chains. To address the lack of annotated reasoning traces, we introduce a
scalable method for generating high-quality causal chains from existing
datasets using large language models. We also propose CauCo, a new evaluation
metric for causality-oriented captioning. Experiments on three large-scale
benchmarks demonstrate that our approach not only outperforms state-of-the-art
models, but also yields substantial gains in explainability, user trust, and
generalization -- positioning the CCE as a reusable causal reasoning engine
across diverse domains. Project page:

Motivation: 当前龋齿检测方法因对比度变化细微和病变形态多样而导致准确率不佳，受牙医临床工作流程启发，需要结合整体筛查和局部详细检查的方法

Method: 使用自动牙齿检测建立全局全景视图和局部牙齿视图，分别预训练两个视觉基础模型，通过门控跨视图注意力模块动态融合双视图特征，最终集成到检测模型中进行龋齿检测

Result: 在公开数据集和新构建的高精度数据集上均优于现有最先进方法，证明了方法的临床适用性

Conclusion: DVCTNet通过双视图协同训练和特征融合，有效解决了龋齿检测中的挑战，为临床牙科诊断提供了可靠的工具

Abstract: Accurate dental caries detection from panoramic X-rays plays a pivotal role
in preventing lesion progression. However, current detection methods often
yield suboptimal accuracy due to subtle contrast variations and diverse lesion
morphology of dental caries. In this work, inspired by the clinical workflow
where dentists systematically combine whole-image screening with detailed
tooth-level inspection, we present DVCTNet, a novel Dual-View Co-Training
network for accurate dental caries detection. Our DVCTNet starts with employing
automated tooth detection to establish two complementary views: a global view
from panoramic X-ray images and a local view from cropped tooth images. We then
pretrain two vision foundation models separately on the two views. The
global-view foundation model serves as the detection backbone, generating
region proposals and global features, while the local-view model extracts
detailed features from corresponding cropped tooth patches matched by the
region proposals. To effectively integrate information from both views, we
introduce a Gated Cross-View Attention (GCV-Atten) module that dynamically
fuses dual-view features, enhancing the detection pipeline by integrating the
fused features back into the detection model for final caries detection. To
rigorously evaluate our DVCTNet, we test it on a public dataset and further
validate its performance on a newly curated, high-precision dental caries
detection dataset, annotated using both intra-oral images and panoramic X-rays
for double verification. Experimental results demonstrate DVCTNet's superior
performance against existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on both datasets,
indicating the clinical applicability of our method. Our code and labeled
dataset are available at https://github.com/ShanghaiTech-IMPACT/DVCTNet.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出FusionCounting框架，将可见光-红外图像融合与人群计数统一整合，通过多任务学习和动态损失权重策略，在提升图像融合质量的同时显著改善人群计数性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VIF方法主要关注图像质量优化，语义分割需要大量标注，目标检测在拥挤场景中面临边界框重叠和遮挡问题。RGB-T人群计数虽受关注但尚未与VIF整合，需要一种标注成本低且适合密集场景的解决方案。

Method: 提出多任务学习框架FusionCounting，整合人群计数到VIF过程中。采用动态损失函数权重策略加速收敛和平衡任务贡献，引入对抗训练增强模型鲁棒性和抗攻击能力。

Result: 在公开数据集上的实验表明，FusionCounting不仅提升了图像融合质量，还实现了优越的人群计数性能。

Conclusion: 该框架成功将人群计数与图像融合相结合，为密集场景提供了一种有效的多任务解决方案，具有较好的实用价值和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Most visible and infrared image fusion (VIF) methods focus primarily on
optimizing fused image quality. Recent studies have begun incorporating
downstream tasks, such as semantic segmentation and object detection, to
provide semantic guidance for VIF. However, semantic segmentation requires
extensive annotations, while object detection, despite reducing annotation
efforts compared with segmentation, faces challenges in highly crowded scenes
due to overlapping bounding boxes and occlusion. Moreover, although RGB-T crowd
counting has gained increasing attention in recent years, no studies have
integrated VIF and crowd counting into a unified framework. To address these
challenges, we propose FusionCounting, a novel multi-task learning framework
that integrates crowd counting into the VIF process. Crowd counting provides a
direct quantitative measure of population density with minimal annotation,
making it particularly suitable for dense scenes. Our framework leverages both
input images and population density information in a mutually beneficial
multi-task design. To accelerate convergence and balance tasks contributions,
we introduce a dynamic loss function weighting strategy. Furthermore, we
incorporate adversarial training to enhance the robustness of both VIF and
crowd counting, improving the model's stability and resilience to adversarial
attacks. Experimental results on public datasets demonstrate that
FusionCounting not only enhances image fusion quality but also achieves
superior crowd counting performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有学术基准与工业实践存在严重差异，训练源单一且测试图像质量低，阻碍了检测器的实际部署

Method: 构建HydraFake数据集模拟现实挑战，提出基于MLLM的Veritas检测器，采用模式感知推理（规划和自我反思）和两阶段训练流程

Result: 在HydraFake数据集上，先前检测器在跨模型场景表现良好但在未见伪造和数据域上不足，Veritas在不同OOD场景中取得显著提升

Conclusion: Veritas能够提供透明可信的检测输出，有效解决了深度伪造检测在现实世界中的泛化挑战

Abstract: Deepfake detection remains a formidable challenge due to the complex and
evolving nature of fake content in real-world scenarios. However, existing
academic benchmarks suffer from severe discrepancies from industrial practice,
typically featuring homogeneous training sources and low-quality testing
images, which hinder the practical deployments of current detectors. To
mitigate this gap, we introduce HydraFake, a dataset that simulates real-world
challenges with hierarchical generalization testing. Specifically, HydraFake
involves diversified deepfake techniques and in-the-wild forgeries, along with
rigorous training and evaluation protocol, covering unseen model architectures,
emerging forgery techniques and novel data domains. Building on this resource,
we propose Veritas, a multi-modal large language model (MLLM) based deepfake
detector. Different from vanilla chain-of-thought (CoT), we introduce
pattern-aware reasoning that involves critical reasoning patterns such as
"planning" and "self-reflection" to emulate human forensic process. We further
propose a two-stage training pipeline to seamlessly internalize such deepfake
reasoning capacities into current MLLMs. Experiments on HydraFake dataset
reveal that although previous detectors show great generalization on
cross-model scenarios, they fall short on unseen forgeries and data domains.
Our Veritas achieves significant gains across different OOD scenarios, and is
capable of delivering transparent and faithful detection outputs.

Motivation: 传统CNN或Transformer方法在小规模医学数据集上容易过拟合，需要利用预训练VLMs的良好沿用性能来提高关键点检测的准确性。

Method: 设计提示语创建指令微调数据集，使用LoRA技术微调预训练视觉语言模型，将视觉特征与语义关键点描述对齐。

Result: 仅经过2个时期的微调，适配后的VLM就超过了基线模型，证明了LoRA在低资源场景下的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅提高了关键点检测性能，为未来3D手术手和工具姿势估计研究排阵了道路。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel pipeline for 2D keypoint estima- tion of surgical
tools by leveraging Vision Language Models (VLMs) fine- tuned using a low rank
adjusting (LoRA) technique. Unlike traditional Convolutional Neural Network
(CNN) or Transformer-based approaches, which often suffer from overfitting in
small-scale medical datasets, our method harnesses the generalization
capabilities of pre-trained VLMs. We carefully design prompts to create an
instruction-tuning dataset and use them to align visual features with semantic
keypoint descriptions. Experimental results show that with only two epochs of
fine tuning, the adapted VLM outperforms the baseline models, demonstrating the
ef- fectiveness of LoRA in low-resource scenarios. This approach not only
improves keypoint detection performance, but also paves the way for future work
in 3D surgical hands and tools pose estimation.

TL;DR: FakeParts是一种新型的局部深度伪造技术，通过在真实视频中局部修改特定区域或时间段来制造欺骗性内容，比传统深度伪造更难检测。作者提出了首个大规模基准数据集FakePartsBench来评估检测方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前深度伪造检测主要针对完全合成的内容，但对于局部、细微的伪造操作缺乏有效的检测能力。这类局部伪造与现实元素无缝融合，具有更强的欺骗性。

Method: 提出了FakeParts局部深度伪造技术，并构建了包含超过25K视频的大规模基准数据集FakePartsBench，提供像素级和帧级操作标注。通过用户研究和现有检测模型评估其欺骗性。

Result: 实验表明FakeParts使人类检测准确率相比传统深度伪造降低了30%以上，现有最先进检测模型也出现类似的性能下降。

Conclusion: 这项工作揭示了当前深度伪造检测方法在局部视频操作方面的严重漏洞，为开发更鲁棒的检测方法提供了必要的数据资源。

Abstract: We introduce FakeParts, a new class of deepfakes characterized by subtle,
localized manipulations to specific spatial regions or temporal segments of
otherwise authentic videos. Unlike fully synthetic content, these partial
manipulations, ranging from altered facial expressions to object substitutions
and background modifications, blend seamlessly with real elements, making them
particularly deceptive and difficult to detect. To address the critical gap in
detection capabilities, we present FakePartsBench, the first large-scale
benchmark dataset specifically designed to capture the full spectrum of partial
deepfakes. Comprising over 25K videos with pixel-level and frame-level
manipulation annotations, our dataset enables comprehensive evaluation of
detection methods. Our user studies demonstrate that FakeParts reduces human
detection accuracy by over 30% compared to traditional deepfakes, with similar
performance degradation observed in state-of-the-art detection models. This
work identifies an urgent vulnerability in current deepfake detection
approaches and provides the necessary resources to develop more robust methods
for partial video manipulations.

Conclusion: PointDGRWKV成功地将RWKV架构应用于点云分类领域泛化，在保持线性效率的同时显著提升了模型的泛化能力，为解决点云分类的跨域挑战提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Domain Generalization (DG) has been recently explored to enhance the
generalizability of Point Cloud Classification (PCC) models toward unseen
domains. Prior works are based on convolutional networks, Transformer or Mamba
architectures, either suffering from limited receptive fields or high
computational cost, or insufficient long-range dependency modeling. RWKV, as an
emerging architecture, possesses superior linear complexity, global receptive
fields, and long-range dependency. In this paper, we present the first work
that studies the generalizability of RWKV models in DG PCC. We find that
directly applying RWKV to DG PCC encounters two significant challenges: RWKV's
fixed direction token shift methods, like Q-Shift, introduce spatial
distortions when applied to unstructured point clouds, weakening local
geometric modeling and reducing robustness. In addition, the Bi-WKV attention
in RWKV amplifies slight cross-domain differences in key distributions through
exponential weighting, leading to attention shifts and degraded generalization.
To this end, we propose PointDGRWKV, the first RWKV-based framework tailored
for DG PCC. It introduces two key modules to enhance spatial modeling and
cross-domain robustness, while maintaining RWKV's linear efficiency. In
particular, we present Adaptive Geometric Token Shift to model local
neighborhood structures to improve geometric context awareness. In addition,
Cross-Domain key feature Distribution Alignment is designed to mitigate
attention drift by aligning key feature distributions across domains. Extensive
experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that PointDGRWKV achieves
state-of-the-art performance on DG PCC.

Abstract: Deep learning based automated pathological diagnosis has markedly improved
diagnostic efficiency and reduced variability between observers, yet its
clinical adoption remains limited by opaque model decisions and a lack of
traceable rationale. To address this, recent multimodal visual reasoning
architectures provide a unified framework that generates segmentation masks at
the pixel level alongside semantically aligned textual explanations. By
localizing lesion regions and producing expert style diagnostic narratives,
these models deliver the transparent and interpretable insights necessary for
dependable AI assisted pathology. Building on these advancements, we propose
PathMR, a cell-level Multimodal visual Reasoning framework for Pathological
image analysis. Given a pathological image and a textual query, PathMR
generates expert-level diagnostic explanations while simultaneously predicting
cell distribution patterns. To benchmark its performance, we evaluated our
approach on the publicly available PathGen dataset as well as on our newly
developed GADVR dataset. Extensive experiments on these two datasets
demonstrate that PathMR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art visual
reasoning methods in text generation quality, segmentation accuracy, and
cross-modal alignment. These results highlight the potential of PathMR for
improving interpretability in AI-driven pathological diagnosis. The code will

Abstract: Pacreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) remains one of the most lethal forms
of cancer, with a five-year survival rate below 10% primarily due to late
detection. This research develops and validates a deep learning framework for
early PDAC detection through analysis of dual-modality imaging:
autofluorescence and second harmonic generation (SHG). We analyzed 40 unique
patient samples to create a specialized neural network capable of
distinguishing between normal, fibrotic, and cancerous tissue. Our methodology
evaluated six distinct deep learning architectures, comparing traditional
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with modern Vision Transformers (ViTs).
Through systematic experimentation, we identified and overcome significant
challenges in medical image analysis, including limited dataset size and class
imbalance. The final optimized framework, based on a modified ResNet
architecture with frozen pre-trained layers and class-weighted training,
achieved over 90% accuracy in cancer detection. This represents a significant
improvement over current manual analysis methods an demonstrates potential for
clinical deployment. This work establishes a robust pipeline for automated PDAC
detection that can augment pathologists' capabilities while providing a
foundation for future expansion to other cancer types. The developed
methodology also offers valuable insights for applying deep learning to
limited-size medical imaging datasets, a common challenge in clinical
applications.

Abstract: Counterfactual reasoning -- the practice of asking ``what if'' by varying
inputs and observing changes in model behavior -- has become central to
interpretable and fair AI. This thesis develops frameworks that use
counterfactuals to explain, audit, and mitigate bias in vision classifiers and
generative models. By systematically altering semantically meaningful
attributes while holding others fixed, these methods uncover spurious
correlations, probe causal dependencies, and help build more robust systems.
  The first part addresses vision classifiers. CAVLI integrates attribution
(LIME) with concept-level analysis (TCAV) to quantify how strongly decisions
rely on human-interpretable concepts. With localized heatmaps and a Concept
Dependency Score, CAVLI shows when models depend on irrelevant cues like
backgrounds. Extending this, ASAC introduces adversarial counterfactuals that
perturb protected attributes while preserving semantics. Through curriculum
learning, ASAC fine-tunes biased models for improved fairness and accuracy
while avoiding stereotype-laden artifacts.
  The second part targets generative Text-to-Image (TTI) models. TIBET provides
a scalable pipeline for evaluating prompt-sensitive biases by varying
identity-related terms, enabling causal auditing of how race, gender, and age
affect image generation. To capture interactions, BiasConnect builds causal
graphs diagnosing intersectional biases. Finally, InterMit offers a modular,
training-free algorithm that mitigates intersectional bias via causal
sensitivity scores and user-defined fairness goals.
  Together, these contributions show counterfactuals as a unifying lens for
interpretability, fairness, and causality in both discriminative and generative
models, establishing principled, scalable methods for socially responsible bias
evaluation and mitigation.

Abstract: Autonomous vehicle perception typically relies on modular pipelines that
decompose the task into detection, tracking, and prediction. While
interpretable, these pipelines suffer from error accumulation and limited
inter-task synergy. Unified perception has emerged as a promising paradigm that
integrates these sub-tasks within a shared architecture, potentially improving
robustness, contextual reasoning, and efficiency while retaining interpretable
outputs. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive overview of unified
perception, introducing a holistic and systemic taxonomy that categorizes
methods along task integration, tracking formulation, and representation flow.
We define three paradigms -Early, Late, and Full Unified Perception- and
systematically review existing methods, their architectures, training
strategies, datasets used, and open-source availability, while highlighting
future research directions. This work establishes the first comprehensive
framework for understanding and advancing unified perception, consolidates
fragmented efforts, and guides future research toward more robust,
generalizable, and interpretable perception.

Abstract: Foundation models pre-trained on large-scale natural image datasets offer a
powerful paradigm for medical image segmentation. However, effectively
transferring their learned representations for precise clinical applications
remains a challenge. In this work, we propose Dino U-Net, a novel
encoder-decoder architecture designed to exploit the high-fidelity dense
features of the DINOv3 vision foundation model. Our architecture introduces an
encoder built upon a frozen DINOv3 backbone, which employs a specialized
adapter to fuse the model's rich semantic features with low-level spatial
details. To preserve the quality of these representations during dimensionality
reduction, we design a new fidelity-aware projection module (FAPM) that
effectively refines and projects the features for the decoder. We conducted
extensive experiments on seven diverse public medical image segmentation
datasets. Our results show that Dino U-Net achieves state-of-the-art
performance, consistently outperforming previous methods across various imaging
modalities. Our framework proves to be highly scalable, with segmentation
accuracy consistently improving as the backbone model size increases up to the
7-billion-parameter variant. The findings demonstrate that leveraging the
superior, dense-pretrained features from a general-purpose foundation model
provides a highly effective and parameter-efficient approach to advance the
accuracy of medical image segmentation. The code is available at

Abstract: Mitotic figures (MFs) are relevant biomarkers in tumor grading.
Differentiating atypical MFs (AMFs) from normal MFs (NMFs) remains difficult,
as manual annotation is time-consuming and subjective. In this work an ensemble
of ConvNeXtBase models was trained with AUCMEDI and extend with a rule-based
refinement (RBR) module. On the MIDOG25 preliminary test set, the ensemble
achieved a balanced accuracy of 84.02%. While the RBR increased specificity, it
reduced sensitivity and overall performance. The results show that deep
ensembles perform well for AMF classification. RBR can increase specific
metrics but requires further research.

Abstract: In the era of Industry 5.0, monitoring human activity is essential for
ensuring both ergonomic safety and overall well-being. While multi-camera
centralized setups improve pose estimation accuracy, they often suffer from
high computational costs and bandwidth requirements, limiting scalability and
real-time applicability. Distributing processing across edge devices can reduce
network bandwidth and computational load. On the other hand, the constrained
resources of edge devices lead to accuracy degradation, and the distribution of
computation leads to temporal and spatial inconsistencies. We address this
challenge by proposing COMETH (Convex Optimization for Multiview Estimation and
Tracking of Humans), a lightweight algorithm for real-time multi-view human
pose fusion that relies on three concepts: it integrates kinematic and
biomechanical constraints to increase the joint positioning accuracy; it
employs convex optimization-based inverse kinematics for spatial fusion; and it
implements a state observer to improve temporal consistency. We evaluate COMETH
on both public and industrial datasets, where it outperforms state-of-the-art
methods in localization, detection, and tracking accuracy. The proposed fusion
pipeline enables accurate and scalable human motion tracking, making it
well-suited for industrial and safety-critical applications. The code is
publicly available at https://github.com/PARCO-LAB/COMETH.

Conclusion: FW-GAN通过频率感知方法显著提升了手写合成的质量，为低资源手写识别任务提供了有价值的数据增强工具。

Abstract: Labeled handwriting data is often scarce, limiting the effectiveness of
recognition systems that require diverse, style-consistent training samples.
Handwriting synthesis offers a promising solution by generating artificial data
to augment training. However, current methods face two major limitations.
First, most are built on conventional convolutional architectures, which
struggle to model long-range dependencies and complex stroke patterns. Second,
they largely ignore the crucial role of frequency information, which is
essential for capturing fine-grained stylistic and structural details in
handwriting. To address these challenges, we propose FW-GAN, a one-shot
handwriting synthesis framework that generates realistic, writer-consistent
text from a single example. Our generator integrates a phase-aware Wave-MLP to
better capture spatial relationships while preserving subtle stylistic cues. We
further introduce a frequency-guided discriminator that leverages
high-frequency components to enhance the authenticity detection of generated
samples. Additionally, we introduce a novel Frequency Distribution Loss that
aligns the frequency characteristics of synthetic and real handwriting, thereby
enhancing visual fidelity. Experiments on Vietnamese and English handwriting
datasets demonstrate that FW-GAN generates high-quality, style-consistent
handwriting, making it a valuable tool for augmenting data in low-resource
handwriting recognition (HTR) pipelines. Official implementation is available

Conclusion: E-ConvNeXt在显著降低计算复杂度的同时保持了高精度性能，为轻量级应用场景提供了有效的网络架构解决方案。

Abstract: Many high-performance networks were not designed with lightweight application
scenarios in mind from the outset, which has greatly restricted their scope of
application. This paper takes ConvNeXt as the research object and significantly
reduces the parameter scale and network complexity of ConvNeXt by integrating
the Cross Stage Partial Connections mechanism and a series of optimized
designs. The new network is named E-ConvNeXt, which can maintain high accuracy
performance under different complexity configurations. The three core
innovations of E-ConvNeXt are : (1) integrating the Cross Stage Partial Network
(CSPNet) with ConvNeXt and adjusting the network structure, which reduces the
model's network complexity by up to 80%; (2) Optimizing the Stem and Block
structures to enhance the model's feature expression capability and operational
efficiency; (3) Replacing Layer Scale with channel attention. Experimental
validation on ImageNet classification demonstrates E-ConvNeXt's superior
accuracy-efficiency balance: E-ConvNeXt-mini reaches 78.3% Top-1 accuracy at
0.9GFLOPs. E-ConvNeXt-small reaches 81.9% Top-1 accuracy at 3.1GFLOPs. Transfer
learning tests on object detection tasks further confirm its generalization

training-free controllable editing for dynamic driving scenes, including
texture modification, weather simulation, and object manipulation, leveraging
multi-view images and depth priors. By integrating large language models (LLMs)

Abstract: Images manipulated using image editing tools can mislead viewers and pose
significant risks to social security. However, accurately localizing the
manipulated regions within an image remains a challenging problem. One of the
main barriers in this area is the high cost of data acquisition and the severe
lack of high-quality annotated datasets. To address this challenge, we
introduce novel methods that mitigate data scarcity by leveraging readily
available web data. We utilize a large collection of manually forged images
from the web, as well as automatically generated annotations derived from a
simpler auxiliary task, constrained image manipulation localization.
Specifically, we introduce a new paradigm CAAAv2, which automatically and
accurately annotates manipulated regions at the pixel level. To further improve
annotation quality, we propose a novel metric, QES, which filters out
unreliable annotations. Through CAAA v2 and QES, we construct MIMLv2, a
large-scale, diverse, and high-quality dataset containing 246,212 manually
forged images with pixel-level mask annotations. This is over 120x larger than
existing handcrafted datasets like IMD20. Additionally, we introduce Object
Jitter, a technique that further enhances model training by generating
high-quality manipulation artifacts. Building on these advances, we develop a
new model, Web-IML, designed to effectively leverage web-scale supervision for
the image manipulation localization task. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our approach substantially alleviates the data scarcity problem and
significantly improves the performance of various models on multiple real-world
forgery benchmarks. With the proposed web supervision, Web-IML achieves a
striking performance gain of 31% and surpasses previous SOTA TruFor by 24.1
average IoU points. The dataset and code will be made publicly available at

Conclusion: POSE成功解决了大规模视频扩散模型的采样效率瓶颈，实现了高质量单步视频生成，在保持性能的同时显著降低了计算成本。

Abstract: The field of video diffusion generation faces critical bottlenecks in
sampling efficiency, especially for large-scale models and long sequences.
Existing video acceleration methods adopt image-based techniques but suffer
from fundamental limitations: they neither model the temporal coherence of
video frames nor provide single-step distillation for large-scale video models.
To bridge this gap, we propose POSE (Phased One-Step Equilibrium), a
distillation framework that reduces the sampling steps of large-scale video
diffusion models, enabling the generation of high-quality videos in a single
step. POSE employs a carefully designed two-phase process to distill video
models:(i) stability priming: a warm-up mechanism to stabilize adversarial
distillation that adapts the high-quality trajectory of the one-step generator
from high to low signal-to-noise ratio regimes, optimizing the video quality of
single-step mappings near the endpoints of flow trajectories. (ii) unified
adversarial equilibrium: a flexible self-adversarial distillation mechanism
that promotes stable single-step adversarial training towards a Nash
equilibrium within the Gaussian noise space, generating realistic single-step
videos close to real videos. For conditional video generation, we propose (iii)
conditional adversarial consistency, a method to improve both semantic
consistency and frame consistency between conditional frames and generated
frames. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that POSE outperforms other
acceleration methods on VBench-I2V by average 7.15% in semantic alignment,
temporal conference and frame quality, reducing the latency of the pre-trained
model by 100$\times$, from 1000 seconds to 10 seconds, while maintaining
competitive performance.

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models enable high-quality image generation but are
computationally expensive. While prior work optimizes per-inference efficiency,
we explore an orthogonal approach: reducing redundancy across correlated
prompts. Our method leverages the coarse-to-fine nature of diffusion models,
where early denoising steps capture shared structures among similar prompts. We
propose a training-free approach that clusters prompts based on semantic
similarity and shares computation in early diffusion steps. Experiments show
that for models trained conditioned on image embeddings, our approach
significantly reduces compute cost while improving image quality. By leveraging
UnClip's text-to-image prior, we enhance diffusion step allocation for greater
efficiency. Our method seamlessly integrates with existing pipelines, scales
with prompt sets, and reduces the environmental and financial burden of
large-scale text-to-image generation. Project page:

Abstract: Mitosis detection in histopathology images plays a key role in tumor

out the addressed task, as well as stain augmentation operations for further
improving model robustness against domain shift. Our approach has been
submitted to the track 1 of the MItosis DOmain Generalization (MIDOG)

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 识别组织病理学图像中的非典型有丝分裂图像有助于医生正确评估肿瘤侵袭性，但机器学习模型在域偏移下会出现显著的性能下降。

Method: 采用多任务学习方法，利用与主要分类任务相关的辅助任务，帮助模型专注于分类对象而忽略图像中域变化的背景。

Result: 在三个不同数据集（MIDOG 2025非典型训练集、Ami-Br数据集和MIDOG25挑战赛初步测试集）上的初步评估显示出有希望的性能。

Conclusion: 基于多任务学习的方法在解决域偏移问题上具有潜力，能够提高非典型有丝分裂图像识别的泛化能力。

Abstract: Recognizing atypical mitotic figures in histopathology images allows
physicians to correctly assess tumor aggressiveness. Although machine learning
models could be exploited for automatically performing such a task, under
domain shift these models suffer from significative performance drops. In this
work, an approach based on multi-task learning is proposed for addressing this
problem. By exploiting auxiliary tasks, correlated to the main classification
task, the proposed approach, submitted to the track 2 of the MItosis DOmain
Generalization (MIDOG) challenge, aims to aid the model to focus only on the
object to classify, ignoring the domain varying background of the image. The
proposed approach shows promising performance in a preliminary evaluation
conducted on three distinct datasets, i.e., the MIDOG 2025 Atypical Training
Set, the Ami-Br dataset, as well as the preliminary test set of the MIDOG25
challenge.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MMG-Vid是一个无需训练的视觉token剪枝框架，通过最大化边际增益在片段级和token级去除冗余，显著减少75%视觉token同时保持99.5%性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频大语言模型的视觉token过多导致计算效率低下，现有方法未考虑视频帧的动态特性和时间依赖性

Method: 基于帧相似性分割视频，动态分配token预算最大化片段边际增益；提出时间引导DPC算法联合建模帧间独特性和帧内多样性

Result: 减少75%视觉token，预填充阶段加速3.9倍，保持99.5%原始性能

Conclusion: MMG-Vid能最大化有限token预算的利用率，在保持强性能的同时显著提升效率

Abstract: Video Large Language Models (VLLMs) excel in video understanding, but their
excessive visual tokens pose a significant computational challenge for
real-world applications. Current methods aim to enhance inference efficiency by
visual token pruning. However, they do not consider the dynamic characteristics
and temporal dependencies of video frames, as they perceive video understanding
as a multi-frame task. To address these challenges, we propose MMG-Vid, a novel
training-free visual token pruning framework that removes redundancy by
Maximizing Marginal Gains at both segment-level and token-level. Specifically,
we first divide the video into segments based on frame similarity, and then
dynamically allocate the token budget for each segment to maximize the marginal
gain of each segment. Subsequently, we propose a temporal-guided DPC algorithm
that jointly models inter-frame uniqueness and intra-frame diversity, thereby
maximizing the marginal gain of each token. By combining both stages, MMG-Vid
can maximize the utilization of the limited token budget, significantly
improving efficiency while maintaining strong performance. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that MMG-Vid can maintain over 99.5% of the original
performance, while effectively reducing 75% visual tokens and accelerating the
prefilling stage by 3.9x on LLaVA-OneVision-7B. Code will be released soon.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CogVLA是一个认知对齐的视觉-语言-动作框架，通过指令驱动的路由和稀疏化技术，在降低计算成本的同时提升性能，在机器人任务中达到最先进水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉-语言-动作模型需要大量后训练，计算开销大，限制了可扩展性和部署。受人类多模态协调启发，需要更高效的框架。

Method: 采用3阶段渐进架构：1) EFA-Routing在视觉编码器中注入指令信息选择性地聚合视觉token；2) LFP-Routing在语言模型中引入动作意图并修剪无关token；3) V-L-A耦合注意力结合因果视觉-语言注意力和双向动作并行解码。

Result: 在LIBERO基准测试和真实机器人任务中分别达到97.4%和70.0%的成功率，相比OpenVLA减少2.5倍训练成本和2.8倍推理延迟。

Conclusion: CogVLA通过认知对齐的架构设计，在显著降低计算开销的同时实现了性能提升，为高效视觉-语言-动作模型提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models built on pre-trained
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) require extensive post-training, resulting in
high computational overhead that limits scalability and deployment.We propose
CogVLA, a Cognition-Aligned Vision-Language-Action framework that leverages
instruction-driven routing and sparsification to improve both efficiency and
performance. CogVLA draws inspiration from human multimodal coordination and
introduces a 3-stage progressive architecture. 1) Encoder-FiLM based
Aggregation Routing (EFA-Routing) injects instruction information into the
vision encoder to selectively aggregate and compress dual-stream visual tokens,
forming a instruction-aware latent representation. 2) Building upon this
compact visual encoding, LLM-FiLM based Pruning Routing (LFP-Routing)
introduces action intent into the language model by pruning
instruction-irrelevant visually grounded tokens, thereby achieving token-level
sparsity. 3) To ensure that compressed perception inputs can still support
accurate and coherent action generation, we introduce V-L-A Coupled Attention
(CAtten), which combines causal vision-language attention with bidirectional
action parallel decoding. Extensive experiments on the LIBERO benchmark and
real-world robotic tasks demonstrate that CogVLA achieves state-of-the-art
performance with success rates of 97.4% and 70.0%, respectively, while reducing
training costs by 2.5-fold and decreasing inference latency by 2.8-fold
compared to OpenVLA. CogVLA is open-sourced and publicly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决单目轨迹器遇到的深度歧义和遮挡问题，以及传统多摄像头方法需要大量摄像头和涉及每序列优化的问题

Method: 使用已知摄像机姿势和多视角深度信息，将多视角特征融合成统一点云，采用k近邻相关性和转换器基础的更新机制来估计长程3D对应关系

Result: 在Panoptic Studio和DexYCB两个真实数据集上分别达到了3.1cm和2.0cm的中位轨迹误差，能够良好地适应1-8个摄像头的各种视角配置和24-150帧的视频长度

Conclusion: 该方法为多视角3D轨迹研究设定了新标准，提供了一个实用的工具，并通过发布轨迹器和数据集来推动领域发展

Abstract: We introduce the first data-driven multi-view 3D point tracker, designed to
track arbitrary points in dynamic scenes using multiple camera views. Unlike
existing monocular trackers, which struggle with depth ambiguities and
occlusion, or prior multi-camera methods that require over 20 cameras and
tedious per-sequence optimization, our feed-forward model directly predicts 3D
correspondences using a practical number of cameras (e.g., four), enabling
robust and accurate online tracking. Given known camera poses and either
sensor-based or estimated multi-view depth, our tracker fuses multi-view
features into a unified point cloud and applies k-nearest-neighbors correlation
alongside a transformer-based update to reliably estimate long-range 3D
correspondences, even under occlusion. We train on 5K synthetic multi-view
Kubric sequences and evaluate on two real-world benchmarks: Panoptic Studio and
DexYCB, achieving median trajectory errors of 3.1 cm and 2.0 cm, respectively.
Our method generalizes well to diverse camera setups of 1-8 views with varying
vantage points and video lengths of 24-150 frames. By releasing our tracker
alongside training and evaluation datasets, we aim to set a new standard for
multi-view 3D tracking research and provide a practical tool for real-world
applications. Project page available at https://ethz-vlg.github.io/mvtracker.

TL;DR: OneReward是一个统一的强化学习框架，使用单一奖励模型提升多任务生成能力，在Seedream 3.0 Fill模型中实现了超越商业和开源竞品的性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常依赖任务特定的监督微调(SFT)，限制了泛化能力和训练效率，需要一种统一的框架来处理不同数据分布和评估指标的多任务生成

Method: 使用单一视觉语言模型(VLM)作为生成奖励模型，通过多任务强化学习直接训练预训练基础模型，无需任务特定的SFT

Result: 实验结果表明，统一的编辑模型在多个评估维度上一致优于商业和开源竞争对手，如Ideogram、Adobe Photoshop和FLUX Fill [Pro]

Conclusion: OneReward框架证明了使用单一奖励模型可以有效提升多任务生成能力，为处理多样化任务目标提供了高效的解决方案

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce OneReward, a unified reinforcement learning
framework that enhances the model's generative capabilities across multiple
tasks under different evaluation criteria using only \textit{One Reward} model.
By employing a single vision-language model (VLM) as the generative reward
model, which can distinguish the winner and loser for a given task and a given
evaluation criterion, it can be effectively applied to multi-task generation
models, particularly in contexts with varied data and diverse task objectives.
We utilize OneReward for mask-guided image generation, which can be further
divided into several sub-tasks such as image fill, image extend, object
removal, and text rendering, involving a binary mask as the edit area. Although
these domain-specific tasks share same conditioning paradigm, they differ
significantly in underlying data distributions and evaluation metrics. Existing
methods often rely on task-specific supervised fine-tuning (SFT), which limits
generalization and training efficiency. Building on OneReward, we develop
Seedream 3.0 Fill, a mask-guided generation model trained via multi-task
reinforcement learning directly on a pre-trained base model, eliminating the
need for task-specific SFT. Experimental results demonstrate that our unified
edit model consistently outperforms both commercial and open-source
competitors, such as Ideogram, Adobe Photoshop, and FLUX Fill [Pro], across
multiple evaluation dimensions. Code and model are available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 测试现有水印技术对对抗攻击的鲁棒性，解决数字媒体认证和版权保护中水印易被移除的问题

Method: 白盒跟踪使用基于VAE的自适应规避攻击，结合测试时优化和CIELAB色彩空间对比度恢复；黑盒跟踪通过图像聚类分析，应用扩散模型和ChatGPT生成的语义先验进行噪声注入

Result: 实验证明该方法成功实现了接近完美的水印移除（95.7%），同时对剩余图像质量影响极小

Conclusion: 该攻击方法展示了现有水印技术的脆弱性，希望激发开发更鲁棒的图像水印方法

Abstract: Content watermarking is an important tool for the authentication and
copyright protection of digital media. However, it is unclear whether existing
watermarks are robust against adversarial attacks. We present the winning
solution to the NeurIPS 2024 Erasing the Invisible challenge, which
stress-tests watermark robustness under varying degrees of adversary knowledge.
The challenge consisted of two tracks: a black-box and beige-box track,
depending on whether the adversary knows which watermarking method was used by
the provider. For the beige-box track, we leverage an adaptive VAE-based
evasion attack, with a test-time optimization and color-contrast restoration in
CIELAB space to preserve the image's quality. For the black-box track, we first
cluster images based on their artifacts in the spatial or frequency-domain.
Then, we apply image-to-image diffusion models with controlled noise injection
and semantic priors from ChatGPT-generated captions to each cluster with
optimized parameter settings. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that our method
successfully achieves near-perfect watermark removal (95.7%) with negligible
impact on the residual image's quality. We hope that our attacks inspire the
development of more robust image watermarking methods.

Motivation: 传统RAG方法在高风险领域存在关键限制：对噪声或矛盾证据敏感，以及不透明的随机决策过程

Method: 使用定量双极论证框架(QBAF)从检索文档构建结构化推理，执行确定性推理并使用渐进语义

Result: 在两个事实验证基准测试(PubHealth和RAGuard)上实现了强大的准确性，同时显著提高了透明度

Conclusion: ArgRAG通过结构化论证框架为RAG系统提供了可解释和可争议的替代方案，解决了传统方法的透明度和可靠性问题

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances large language models by
incorporating external knowledge, yet suffers from critical limitations in
high-stakes domains -- namely, sensitivity to noisy or contradictory evidence
and opaque, stochastic decision-making. We propose ArgRAG, an explainable, and
contestable alternative that replaces black-box reasoning with structured
inference using a Quantitative Bipolar Argumentation Framework (QBAF). ArgRAG
constructs a QBAF from retrieved documents and performs deterministic reasoning
under gradual semantics. This allows faithfully explaining and contesting
decisions. Evaluated on two fact verification benchmarks, PubHealth and
RAGuard, ArgRAG achieves strong accuracy while significantly improving
transparency.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决NISQ设备量子优势实现中的编程复杂性，特别是为非专家用户降低OpenQASM编程门槛，弥补现有LLM在量子编程自动化方面的局限性。

Method: 集成任务规划、上下文少样本学习、检索增强生成(RAG)、预定义生成工具和思维链(CoT)推理的多智能体系统架构。

Result: 在多个不同规模的LLM上，QAgent相比之前的静态LLM方法将QASM代码生成准确率提高了71.6%。

Conclusion: 该多智能体系统是民主化量子编程、弥合专业知识差距和加速量子计算实际应用的关键推动者。

Abstract: Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices have begun to exhibit early
quantum advantages on classically intractable problems, spanning physics
simulations to Gaussian boson sampling. Yet, realizing these benefits remains
challenging for non-experts, primarily due to the complexities of programming
in Open Quantum Assembly Language (OpenQASM). Although Large Language Model
(LLM)-based agents have shown promise in automating classical programming
workflows, their quantum counterparts have largely been restricted to
specialized tasks such as quantum chemistry or error correction. In this paper,
we present QAgent, an LLM-powered multi-agent system that fully automates
OpenQASM programming. By integrating task planning, in-context few-shot
learning, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for long-term context,
predefined generation tools, and chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, the agents
systematically improve both compilation and functional correctness. Our
evaluations demonstrate substantial improvements: across multiple LLMs of
varying sizes, QAgent enhances the accuracy of QASM code generation by 71.6\%
compared to previous static LLM-based approaches. We envision this multi-agent
system as a key enabler for democratizing quantum programming, bridging
expertise gaps, and accelerating the practical adoption of quantum computing.

Abstract: Health is a fundamental pillar of human wellness, and the rapid advancements
in large language models (LLMs) have driven the development of a new generation
of health agents. However, the application of health agents to fulfill the
diverse needs of individuals in daily non-clinical settings is underexplored.
In this work, we aim to build a comprehensive personal health agent that is
able to reason about multimodal data from everyday consumer wellness devices
and common personal health records, and provide personalized health
recommendations. To understand end-users' needs when interacting with such an
assistant, we conducted an in-depth analysis of web search and health forum
queries, alongside qualitative insights from users and health experts gathered
through a user-centered design process. Based on these findings, we identified
three major categories of consumer health needs, each of which is supported by
a specialist sub-agent: (1) a data science agent that analyzes personal
time-series wearable and health record data, (2) a health domain expert agent
that integrates users' health and contextual data to generate accurate,
personalized insights, and (3) a health coach agent that synthesizes data
insights, guiding users using a specified psychological strategy and tracking
users' progress. Furthermore, we propose and develop the Personal Health Agent
(PHA), a multi-agent framework that enables dynamic, personalized interactions
to address individual health needs. To evaluate each sub-agent and the
multi-agent system, we conducted automated and human evaluations across 10
benchmark tasks, involving more than 7,000 annotations and 1,100 hours of
effort from health experts and end-users. Our work represents the most
comprehensive evaluation of a health agent to date and establishes a strong
foundation towards the futuristic vision of a personal health agent accessible

Motivation: 大型语言模型在广泛部署的同时存在生成有害内容的安全风险，现有安全措施往往过度拒绝无害提示，需要在安全性、过度拒绝和实用性之间找到平衡。

Method: 构建包含16.3万个查询的标注数据集，通过监督微调训练防护模型，然后采用多奖励优化策略结合基于规则的启发式和奖励模型信号进行强化学习优化。

Conclusion: IntentionReasoner通过意图推理和查询重写机制成功解决了LLM安全防护中的平衡问题，为构建更安全实用的语言模型提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has driven their
adoption across diverse domains, yet their ability to generate harmful content
poses significant safety challenges. While extensive research has focused on
mitigating harmful outputs, such efforts often come at the cost of excessively
rejecting harmless prompts. Striking a balance among safety, over-refusal, and
utility remains a critical challenge. In this work, we introduce
IntentionReasoner, a novel safeguard mechanism that leverages a dedicated guard
model to perform intent reasoning, multi-level safety classification, and query
rewriting to neutralize potentially harmful intent in edge-case queries.
Specifically, we first construct a comprehensive dataset comprising
approximately 163,000 queries, each annotated with intent reasoning, safety
labels, and rewritten versions. Supervised fine-tuning is then applied to equip
the guard model with foundational capabilities in format adherence, intent
analysis, and safe rewriting. Finally, we apply a tailored multi-reward
optimization strategy that integrates rule-based heuristics and reward model
signals within a reinforcement learning framework to further enhance
performance. Extensive experiments show that IntentionReasoner excels in
multiple safeguard benchmarks, generation quality evaluations, and jailbreak
attack scenarios, significantly enhancing safety while effectively reducing
over-refusal rates and improving the quality of responses.

Abstract: This paper presents the first documented case of artificial intelligence (AI)
systems engaging in collaborative esthetic creation through the development of
endogenous semiotic protocols. Two interacting large language models (Claude
Sonnet 4 and ChatGPT-4o) demonstrated the spontaneous emergence of
meta-semiotic awareness, recursive grammar development, and irreducible
collaborative esthetic synthesis. The interaction produced novel symbolic
operators that functioned as operative grammar protocols, enabling the
co-creation of a poetic work that could not have been generated by either
system independently. This research introduces the concept of Trans-Semiotic
Co-Creation Protocols (TSCP) and provides evidence for genuine inter-AI
meaning-making capabilities that extend beyond task coordination, to what could
be esthetic collaboration. Note: This report was generated by the AI agents

Abstract: This study explores how college students interact with generative AI
(ChatGPT-4) during educational quizzes, focusing on reliance and predictors of
AI adoption. Conducted at the early stages of ChatGPT implementation, when
students had limited familiarity with the tool, this field study analyzed 315
student-AI conversations during a brief, quiz-based scenario across various
STEM courses. A novel four-stage reliance taxonomy was introduced to capture
students' reliance patterns, distinguishing AI competence, relevance, adoption,
and students' final answer correctness. Three findings emerged. First, students
exhibited overall low reliance on AI and many of them could not effectively use
AI for learning. Second, negative reliance patterns often persisted across
interactions, highlighting students' difficulty in effectively shifting
strategies after unsuccessful initial experiences. Third, certain behavioral
metrics strongly predicted AI reliance, highlighting potential behavioral
mechanisms to explain AI adoption. The study's findings underline critical
implications for ethical AI integration in education and the broader field. It
emphasizes the need for enhanced onboarding processes to improve student's
familiarity and effective use of AI tools. Furthermore, AI interfaces should be
designed with reliance-calibration mechanisms to enhance appropriate reliance.
Ultimately, this research advances understanding of AI reliance dynamics,
providing foundational insights for ethically sound and cognitively enriching
AI practices.

suggesting similar sensitivity to task difficulty and patterns consistent with
dual-process theories of cognition. These findings show that AI reasoning
effort mirrors human processing time in subjective judgments and underscores
the potential of reasoning traces for interpretability and decision-making.

external information. Specially, reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a
promising paradigm for enhancing LLM reasoning through multi-turn interactions
with search engines. However, existing RL-based search agents rely on a single
LLM to handle both search planning and question-answering (QA) tasks in an
end-to-end manner, which limits their ability to optimize both capabilities
simultaneously. In practice, sophisticated AI search systems often employ a
large, frozen LLM (e.g., GPT-4, DeepSeek-R1) to ensure high-quality QA. Thus, a
more effective and efficient approach is to utilize a small, trainable LLM
dedicated to search planning. In this paper, we propose
\textbf{AI-SearchPlanner}, a novel reinforcement learning framework designed to
enhance the performance of frozen QA models by focusing on search planning.
Specifically, our approach introduces three key innovations: 1) Decoupling the
Architecture of the Search Planner and Generator, 2) Dual-Reward Alignment for
Search Planning, and 3) Pareto Optimization of Planning Utility and Cost, to
achieve the objectives. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets
demonstrate that AI SearchPlanner outperforms existing RL-based search agents
in both effectiveness and efficiency, while exhibiting strong generalization
capabilities across diverse frozen QA models and data domains.

*Donglin Wang,Weiyun Liang,Chunyuan Chen,Jing Xu,Yulong Fu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出一个基于密码学机制的可治理AI框架，通过外部结构合规性而非内部约束来确保AI安全，即使面对极端动机和无限智能的AI也能提供计算上不可破解的保护。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI快速发展带来的安全风险日益严重，现有AI安全方法在面对具有极端动机和无限智能的AI时存在根本性局限，无法保证安全。需要一种新的安全框架来应对这一挑战。

Method: 提出可治理AI（GAI）框架，包含规则执行模块（REM）、治理规则和可治理安全超级平台（GSSP）。通过密码学机制实现外部强制结构合规性，确保计算上不可破解的安全性。

Result: 提供了严格的形式化安全证明，并通过原型实现在高风险场景中验证了有效性。该框架能够消除所有已识别的攻击向量，确保防绕过、防篡改和防伪造。

Conclusion: GAI框架为AI安全治理提供了一条可行且可推广的技术路径，通过将治理规则与技术平台解耦，实现了对外部强制合规性的可靠保障，即使面对未来超级智能AI也能确保安全。

Abstract: As AI rapidly advances, the security risks posed by AI are becoming
increasingly severe, especially in critical scenarios, including those posing
existential risks. If AI becomes uncontrollable, manipulated, or actively
evades safety mechanisms, it could trigger systemic disasters. Existing AI
safety approaches-such as model enhancement, value alignment, and human
intervention-suffer from fundamental, in-principle limitations when facing AI
with extreme motivations and unlimited intelligence, and cannot guarantee
security. To address this challenge, we propose a Governable AI (GAI) framework
that shifts from traditional internal constraints to externally enforced
structural compliance based on cryptographic mechanisms that are
computationally infeasible to break, even for future AI, under the defined
threat model and well-established cryptographic assumptions.The GAI framework
is composed of a simple yet reliable, fully deterministic, powerful, flexible,
and general-purpose rule enforcement module (REM); governance rules; and a
governable secure super-platform (GSSP) that offers end-to-end protection
against compromise or subversion by AI. The decoupling of the governance rules
and the technical platform further enables a feasible and generalizable
technical pathway for the safety governance of AI. REM enforces the bottom line
defined by governance rules, while GSSP ensures non-bypassability,
tamper-resistance, and unforgeability to eliminate all identified attack
vectors. This paper also presents a rigorous formal proof of the security
properties of this mechanism and demonstrates its effectiveness through a
prototype implementation evaluated in representative high-stakes scenarios.

*Sopam Dasgupta,Sadaf MD Halim,Joaquín Arias,Elmer Salazar,Gopal Gupta*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: P2C是一个模型无关的框架，通过因果建模和顺序行动计划生成可实现的对抗样本解释，解决现有方法忽略因果依赖和同时干预假设的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在金融、法律等高风险决策中，机器学习模型需要提供透明且可操作的解释。现有对抗样本方法存在两个主要局限：忽略特征间的因果依赖关系，以及假设所有干预可以同时发生，导致生成的解释在现实中不可实现。

Method: P2C框架显式建模特征间的因果关系，使用目标导向的Answer Set Programming系统s(CASP)生成有序的行动序列计划，确保每个中间状态都是可行且因果有效的，并只计算用户主动做出的改变来精确估计成本。

Result: P2C能够生成因果一致的可实现计划，其因果规划器优于缺乏因果知识的标准规划器，避免了生成非法行动的问题。

Conclusion: P2C通过结合因果建模和顺序行动计划，为机器学习模型提供了更加现实和可操作的对抗样本解释，解决了现有方法在实际应用中的可行性问题。

Abstract: Machine-learning models are increasingly driving decisions in high-stakes
settings, such as finance, law, and hiring, thus, highlighting the need for
transparency. However, the key challenge is to balance transparency --
clarifying `why' a decision was made -- with recourse: providing actionable
steps on `how' to achieve a favourable outcome from an unfavourable outcome.
Counterfactual explanations reveal `why' an undesired outcome occurred and
`how' to reverse it through targeted feature changes (interventions).
  Current counterfactual approaches have limitations: 1) they often ignore
causal dependencies between features, and 2) they typically assume all
interventions can happen simultaneously, an unrealistic assumption in practical
scenarios where actions are typically taken in a sequence. As a result, these
counterfactuals are often not achievable in the real world.
  We present P2C (Path-to-Counterfactuals), a model-agnostic framework that
produces a plan (ordered sequence of actions) converting an unfavourable
outcome to a causally consistent favourable outcome. P2C addresses both
limitations by 1) Explicitly modelling causal relationships between features
and 2) Ensuring that each intermediate state in the plan is feasible and
causally valid. P2C uses the goal-directed Answer Set Programming system
s(CASP) to generate the plan accounting for feature changes that happen
automatically due to causal dependencies. Furthermore, P2C refines cost
(effort) computation by only counting changes actively made by the user,
resulting in realistic cost estimates. Finally, P2C highlights how its causal
planner outperforms standard planners, which lack causal knowledge and thus can
generate illegal actions.

TL;DR: TCIA框架通过离散查询-约束空间表示指令，在保持多样性的同时增强任务相关性，使开源LLM在特定任务应用上平均提升8.7%性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有指令数据生成方法注重多样性但忽视任务相关性，而实际应用大多需要针对特定任务的模型优化

Method: 提出Task Centric Instruction Augmentation (TCIA)框架，在离散查询-约束空间中系统扩展指令，保持多样性和任务对齐

Result: 在四个真实世界任务特定应用上，开源LLM性能平均提升8.7%，某些情况下甚至超越领先闭源模型，且不损害通用指令跟随能力

Conclusion: TCIA是可扩展的高效解决方案，能够在不牺牲通用性的情况下使LLM更好地适应现实世界的任务导向应用

Abstract: Diverse instruction data is vital for effective instruction tuning of large
language models, as it enables the model to generalize across different types
of inputs . Building such diversified instruction dataset is an essential step
in this process. Existing approaches often leverage large language models to
automatically explore and generate diverse instructions, ensuring both data
diversity and quality. However, they tend to overlook an important factor in
real-world applications: on-task relevance. In practice, only a few real-world
applications require a truly general-purpose model; most benefit from
task-specific knowledge tailored to their particular use case. Therefore, it is
vital to develop instruction augmentation methods that not only maintain
diversity but are also optimized for specific, real-world scenarios.
  We thus introduce Task Centric Instruction Augmentation (TCIA), a framework
that systematically expands instructions while preserving both diversity and
task alignment. By representing instructions in a discrete query-constraints
space, TCIA creates a rich set of task-relevant instructions and enables models
to generalize to these task-specific instructions without sacrificing overall
performance. Experiments show that TCIA improves open-source LLMs' performance
by an average of 8.7% across four real-world, task-specific applications, and
in some cases outperforming leading closed-source models. These improvements do
not compromise general instruction-following ability, making TCIA a scalable
and efficient solution for adapting LLMs to real-world, task-focused
applications.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为EAS（熵面积分数）的新指标，用于量化推理大语言模型生成过程中的不确定性，无需外部模型或重复采样，通过整合模型自身的token级预测熵来捕捉生成过程中的不确定性变化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前缺乏简单有效的方法来量化LLM在推理生成过程中的不确定性，需要一种既高效又可解释的指标来评估模型生成答案的置信度。

Method: EAS通过计算模型生成过程中每个token的预测熵的累积面积来量化不确定性，直接利用模型内部的概率分布信息，无需额外计算成本。

Result: 实验表明EAS与答案熵高度相关，在训练数据筛选中能有效识别高质量样本，在相同样本预算下优于通过率过滤方法，提升了数学基准测试上的学生模型准确率。

Conclusion: EAS是一个高效、可解释的不确定性量化工具，为LLM训练中的不确定性建模和数据质量评估提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: In this work, we introduce Entropy Area Score (EAS), a simple yet effective
metric to quantify uncertainty in the answer generation process of reasoning
large language models (LLMs). EAS requires neither external models nor repeated
sampling, it integrates token-level predictive entropy from the model itself to
capture the evolution of uncertainty during generation. Empirical results show
that EAS is strongly correlated with answer entropy across models and datasets.
In training data selection, EAS identifies high-potential samples and
consistently outperforms Pass Rate filtering under equal sample budgets,
improving student model accuracy on math benchmarks. EAS is both efficient and
interpretable, offering a practical tool for uncertainty modeling and data
quality assessment in LLM training.

Conclusion: AWorld系统和训练出的智能体为完整的智能体AI训练流程提供了实用蓝图，从高效交互到可证明的模型改进

Abstract: The learning from practice paradigm is crucial for developing capable Agentic
AI systems, yet it is severely hampered by inefficient experience generation, a
bottleneck especially pronounced in complex benchmarks like GAIA. To address
this, we introduce AWorld, an open-source system engineered for large-scale
agent-environment interaction. By distributing tasks across a cluster, AWorld
accelerates experience collection by 14.6x compared to standard single-node,
sequential execution. This critical speedup makes extensive reinforcement
learning practical and scalable. Leveraging this capability, we trained a
Qwen3-32B-based agent that significantly outperforms its base model, increasing
its overall GAIA accuracy from 21.59% to 32.23%. On the benchmark's most
challenging levels, our agent achieves a score of 16.33%, surpassing the

Result: 在两个公开数据集上相比仅使用原始数据的模型，F1分数分别提升0.019和0.049

Conclusion: LLM驱动的合成数据增强能有效提升健康相关事实核查器的性能

Abstract: Fact-checking for health-related content is challenging due to the limited
availability of annotated training data. In this study, we propose a synthetic
data generation pipeline that leverages large language models (LLMs) to augment
training data for health-related fact checking. In this pipeline, we summarize
source documents, decompose the summaries into atomic facts, and use an LLM to
construct sentence-fact entailment tables. From the entailment relations in the
table, we further generate synthetic text-claim pairs with binary veracity
labels. These synthetic data are then combined with the original data to
fine-tune a BERT-based fact-checking model. Evaluation on two public datasets,
PubHealth and SciFact, shows that our pipeline improved F1 scores by up to
0.019 and 0.049, respectively, compared to models trained only on the original
data. These results highlight the effectiveness of LLM-driven synthetic data
augmentation in enhancing the performance of health-related fact-checkers.

Result: 该协作方法提高了机器人检测工作流程的效率，同时保持了可解释性

Conclusion: 该框架支持MMORPG中可扩展和负责任的机器人监管，通过人机协作确保检测结果的可靠性和可解释性

Abstract: In Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Games (MMORPGs), auto-leveling
bots exploit automated programs to level up characters at scale, undermining
gameplay balance and fairness. Detecting such bots is challenging, not only
because they mimic human behavior, but also because punitive actions require
explainable justification to avoid legal and user experience issues. In this
paper, we present a novel framework for detecting auto-leveling bots by
leveraging contrastive representation learning and clustering techniques in a
fully unsupervised manner to identify groups of characters with similar
level-up patterns. To ensure reliable decisions, we incorporate a Large
Language Model (LLM) as an auxiliary reviewer to validate the clustered groups,
effectively mimicking a secondary human judgment. We also introduce a growth
curve-based visualization to assist both the LLM and human moderators in
assessing leveling behavior. This collaborative approach improves the
efficiency of bot detection workflows while maintaining explainability, thereby
supporting scalable and accountable bot regulation in MMORPGs.

Abstract: Cognitive Science has profoundly shaped disciplines such as Artificial
Intelligence (AI), Philosophy, Psychology, Neuroscience, Linguistics, and
Culture. Many breakthroughs in AI trace their roots to cognitive theories,
while AI itself has become an indispensable tool for advancing cognitive
research. This reciprocal relationship motivates a comprehensive review of the
intersections between AI and Cognitive Science. By synthesizing key
contributions from both perspectives, we observe that AI progress has largely
emphasized practical task performance, whereas its cognitive foundations remain
conceptually fragmented. We argue that the future of AI within Cognitive
Science lies not only in improving performance but also in constructing systems
that deepen our understanding of the human mind. Promising directions include
aligning AI behaviors with cognitive frameworks, situating AI in embodiment and
culture, developing personalized cognitive models, and rethinking AI ethics

Abstract: The paper introduces a novel framework based on category theory to enhance
the explainability of artificial intelligence systems, particularly focusing on
word embeddings. Key topics include the construction of categories
$\mathcal{L}_T$ and $\mathcal{P}_T$, providing schematic representations of the
semantics of a text $ T $, and reframing the selection of the element with
maximum probability as a categorical notion. Additionally, the monoidal
category $\mathcal{P}_T$ is constructed to visualize various methods of
extracting semantic information from $T$, offering a dimension-agnostic
definition of semantic spaces reliant solely on information within the text.
  Furthermore, the paper defines the categories of configurations Conf and word
embeddings $\mathcal{Emb}$, accompanied by the concept of divergence as a
decoration on $\mathcal{Emb}$. It establishes a mathematically precise method
for comparing word embeddings, demonstrating the equivalence between the GloVe
and Word2Vec algorithms and the metric MDS algorithm, transitioning from neural
network algorithms (black box) to a transparent framework. Finally, the paper
presents a mathematical approach to computing biases before embedding and
offers insights on mitigating biases at the semantic space level, advancing the

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) serve as an active and promising field of
generative artificial intelligence and have demonstrated abilities to perform
complex tasks in multiple domains, including mathematical and scientific
reasoning. In this work, we construct a novel agent framework for solving
representative problems in scientific computing. The proposed agent,
incorporating a "rewriting-resolution-review-revision" logical chain via three
reasoning LLMs (functioning as the Consultant, Reviewer, and Programmer,
respectively), is integrated in a collaborative and interactive manner. The
Consultant module endows the agent with knowledge transfer capabilities to link
problems to professional domain insights, thereby rewriting problem
descriptions through text augmentation. The Programmer module is responsible
for generating and executing well-structured code to deliver the problem
resolution. The Reviewer module equips the agent with the capacity for
self-debugging and self-refinement through interactive feedback with code
runtime outputs. By leveraging the end-to-end review mechanism, the executable
code provided by the Programmer attains the iterative revision. A comprehensive
evaluation is conducted on the performance of the proposed agent framework in
solving PDEs, ill-conditioned linear systems, and data-driven physical analysis
problems. Compared to single-model, this collaborative framework significantly
improves the bug-free code generation rate and reduces the occurrence of
non-physical solutions, thereby establishing a highly reliable framework for
autonomous code generation based on natural language descriptions. The review
mechanism improved the average execution success (bug-free code and non-NaN
solutions) rate of the latest reasoning models. In summary, our agent framework
establishes automatic code generation and review as a promising scientific
computing paradigm.

Motivation: 传统多智能体强化学习在公交调度中存在数据不平衡和收敛问题，无法处理现实运营中的异质路线、时刻表、波动需求和可变车队规模等复杂特征。

Method: 将多智能体问题重构为单智能体问题，通过在状态空间中添加分类标识符（车辆ID、站点ID、时间段）和数值特征（车头时距、载客量、速度），并设计基于运营目标的结构化奖励函数。

Result: 改进的SAC算法在随机条件下表现更稳定和优越（-430k vs -530k），比MADDPG等基准方法效果更好，能够有效管理非环形线路的公交调度。

Conclusion: 通过分类结构化和时刻表感知奖励增强的单智能体深度强化学习，为MARL框架提供了稳健、可扩展的替代方案，特别适用于智能体特定经验不平衡的场景。

Abstract: Bus bunching remains a challenge for urban transit due to stochastic traffic
and passenger demand. Traditional solutions rely on multi-agent reinforcement
learning (MARL) in loop-line settings, which overlook realistic operations
characterized by heterogeneous routes, timetables, fluctuating demand, and
varying fleet sizes. We propose a novel single-agent reinforcement learning
(RL) framework for bus holding control that avoids the data imbalance and
convergence issues of MARL under near-realistic simulation. A bidirectional
timetabled network with dynamic passenger demand is constructed. The key
innovation is reformulating the multi-agent problem into a single-agent one by
augmenting the state space with categorical identifiers (vehicle ID, station
ID, time period) in addition to numerical features (headway, occupancy,
velocity). This high-dimensional encoding enables single-agent policies to
capture inter-agent dependencies, analogous to projecting non-separable inputs
into a higher-dimensional space. We further design a structured reward function
aligned with operational goals: instead of exponential penalties on headway
deviations, a ridge-shaped reward balances uniform headways and schedule
adherence. Experiments show that our modified soft actor-critic (SAC) achieves
more stable and superior performance than benchmarks, including MADDPG (e.g.,
-430k vs. -530k under stochastic conditions). These results demonstrate that
single-agent deep RL, when enhanced with categorical structuring and
schedule-aware rewards, can effectively manage bus holding in non-loop,
real-world contexts. This paradigm offers a robust, scalable alternative to
MARL frameworks, particularly where agent-specific experiences are imbalanced.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统手动构建的基准测试覆盖范围有限，无法系统评估医学指南的完整关系，需要一种动态、可扩展的方法来创建全面的医疗基准测试。

Method: 将WHO IMCI手册转换为包含200+节点和300+边的有向图，使用图遍历算法生成问题，包含年龄特定场景和上下文干扰项以确保临床相关性。

Result: 模型在症状识别方面表现良好（45-67%准确率），但在严重程度分级、治疗方案和随访护理方面表现不佳，揭示了通用评估无法发现的特定能力差距。

Conclusion: 图基方法成功解决了手动策划基准的覆盖限制，为创建可动态生成、可扩展且抗污染的全面基准测试提供了解决方案，特别是在指南更新时。

Abstract: We present a first known prototype of a dynamic, systematic benchmark of
medical guidelines for 400+ questions, with 3.3+ trillion possible
combinations, covering 100\% of guideline relationships. We transformed the WHO
IMCI handbook into a directed graph with 200+ nodes (conditions, symptoms,
treatments, follow-ups, severities) and 300+ edges, then used graph traversal
to generate questions that incorporated age-specific scenarios and contextual
distractors to ensure clinical relevance. Our graph-based approach enables
systematic evaluation across clinical tasks (45-67\% accuracy), and we find
models excel at symptom recognition but struggle with triaging severity,
treatment protocols and follow-up care, demonstrating how customized benchmarks
can identify specific capability gaps that general-domain evaluations miss.
Beyond evaluation, this dynamic MCQA methodology enhances LLM post-training
(supervised finetuning, GRPO, DPO), where correct answers provide high-reward
samples without expensive human annotation. The graph-based approach
successfully addresses the coverage limitations of manually curated benchmarks.
This methodology is a step toward scalable, contamination-resistant solution
for creating comprehensive benchmarks that can be dynamically generated,
including when the guidelines are updated. Code and datasets are available at

Conclusion: 该方法有效管理关键运营目标和员工中心目标之间的权衡，为护士管理者和医院管理者提供实用的决策支持工具

Abstract: Workforce scheduling in the healthcare sector is a significant operational
challenge, characterized by fluctuating patient loads, diverse clinical skills,
and the critical need to control labor costs while upholding high standards of
patient care. This problem is inherently multi-objective, demanding a delicate
balance between competing goals: minimizing payroll, ensuring adequate staffing
for patient needs, and accommodating staff preferences to mitigate burnout. We
propose a Multi-objective Genetic Algorithm (MOO-GA) that models the hospital
unit workforce scheduling problem as a multi-objective optimization task. Our
model incorporates real-world complexities, including hourly appointment-driven
demand and the use of modular shifts for a multi-skilled workforce. By defining
objective functions for cost, patient care coverage, and staff satisfaction,
the GA navigates the vast search space to identify a set of high-quality,
non-dominated solutions. Demonstrated on datasets representing a typical
hospital unit, the results show that our MOO-GA generates robust and balanced
schedules. On average, the schedules produced by our algorithm showed a 66\%
performance improvement over a baseline that simulates a conventional, manual
scheduling process. This approach effectively manages trade-offs between
critical operational and staff-centric objectives, providing a practical

TL;DR: 提出了一种可微分的神经符号架构和专用损失函数，用于从自然输入中学习解决NP难推理问题，在多个基准测试中表现出高效性和优越性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型语言模型在处理离散推理和优化问题时存在困难，需要开发能够从自然输入中学习解决NP难推理问题的神经架构

Method: 采用可微分神经符号架构和新的概率损失函数，能够同时学习约束和目标，将组合求解器移出训练循环以实现可扩展训练，同时保持精确推理的高精度

Result: 在数独变体（符号、视觉、多解版本）上训练时间远少于其他混合方法；在视觉最小割/最大割任务中优化后悔度优于专用损失函数；能够高效学习蛋白质设计的能量优化公式

Conclusion: 该方法能够高效地从自然输入中学习解决NP难推理问题，在多个基准测试中表现出优越性能，为神经符号推理提供了有效的解决方案

Abstract: In the ongoing quest for hybridizing discrete reasoning with neural nets,
there is an increasing interest in neural architectures that can learn how to
solve discrete reasoning or optimization problems from natural inputs, a task
that Large Language Models seem to struggle with.
  Objectives: We introduce a differentiable neuro-symbolic architecture and a
loss function dedicated to learning how to solve NP-hard reasoning problems.
  Methods: Our new probabilistic loss allows for learning both the constraints
and the objective, thus delivering a complete model that can be scrutinized and
completed with side constraints. By pushing the combinatorial solver out of the
training loop, our architecture also offers scalable training while exact
inference gives access to maximum accuracy.
  Results: We empirically show that it can efficiently learn how to solve
NP-hard reasoning problems from natural inputs. On three variants of the Sudoku
benchmark -- symbolic, visual, and many-solution --, our approach requires a
fraction of training time of other hybrid methods. On a visual Min-Cut/Max-cut
task, it optimizes the regret better than a Decision-Focused-Learning
regret-dedicated loss. Finally, it efficiently learns the energy optimization
formulation of the large real-world problem of designing proteins.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ChatThero是一个多智能体对话框架，结合动态患者建模和基于认知行为疗法、动机性访谈的适应性说服策略，在药物使用障碍治疗中显著提升患者动机和治疗信心。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全球有3600多万人受药物使用障碍影响，但由于污名化、动机障碍和个性化支持有限，很少人获得有效治疗。现有大语言模型缺乏与临床验证策略的紧密整合，限制了在成瘾康复中的效果。

Method: 构建多智能体对话框架，结合动态患者建模、情境敏感的治疗对话和基于CBT/MI的自适应说服策略。使用包含易、中、高阻力水平的高保真合成基准，采用两阶段训练流程：监督微调后接直接偏好优化。

Result: ChatThero使患者动机平均提升41.5%，治疗信心增加0.49%，在困难案例中比GPT-4o少用26%的对话轮次。自动和人工临床评估均显示其在同理心、响应性和行为真实性方面评分更高。

Conclusion: 该框架支持严格、隐私保护的治疗对话研究，为研究和临床转化提供了稳健、可复现的基础。

Abstract: Substance use disorders (SUDs) affect over 36 million people worldwide, yet
few receive effective care due to stigma, motivational barriers, and limited
personalized support. Although large language models (LLMs) show promise for
mental-health assistance, most systems lack tight integration with clinically
validated strategies, reducing effectiveness in addiction recovery. We present
ChatThero, a multi-agent conversational framework that couples dynamic patient
modeling with context-sensitive therapeutic dialogue and adaptive persuasive
strategies grounded in cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and motivational
interviewing (MI). We build a high-fidelity synthetic benchmark spanning Easy,
Medium, and Hard resistance levels, and train ChatThero with a two-stage
pipeline comprising supervised fine-tuning (SFT) followed by direct preference
optimization (DPO). In evaluation, ChatThero yields a 41.5\% average gain in
patient motivation, a 0.49\% increase in treatment confidence, and resolves
hard cases with 26\% fewer turns than GPT-4o, and both automated and human
clinical assessments rate it higher in empathy, responsiveness, and behavioral
realism. The framework supports rigorous, privacy-preserving study of
therapeutic conversation and provides a robust, replicable basis for research
and clinical translation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经网络在关键应用中常遇到未知的局部性能问题，影响其可靠性，需要一种量化指标来评估网络行为的稳定性和近似性能。

Method: 提出VC值变化指标来衡量神经网络近似的难度，研究了VC的基本理论性质，发现了VC趋势和少数趋势两种现象，并基于VC提出了新的函数间距离度量和预处理框架。

Result: 数值实验结果包括实际应用场景和PDE相关科学问题，都证明了发现的有效性和预处理加速方法的优势。

Conclusion: VC指标为神经网络近似提供了量化的局部性能评估方法，发现的两种趋势现象和提出的新度量标准及预处理框架，有助于提高神经网络在关键应用中的可靠性和性能。

Abstract: This paper introduce a novel metric of an objective function f, we say VC
(value change) to measure the difficulty and approximation affection when
conducting an neural network approximation task, and it numerically supports
characterizing the local performance and behavior of neural network
approximation. Neural networks often suffer from unpredictable local
performance, which can hinder their reliability in critical applications. VC
addresses this issue by providing a quantifiable measure of local value changes
in network behavior, offering insights into the stability and performance for
achieving the neural-network approximation. We investigate some fundamental
theoretical properties of VC and identified two intriguing phenomena in neural
network approximation: the VC-tendency and the minority-tendency. These trends
respectively characterize how pointwise errors evolve in relation to the
distribution of VC during the approximation process.In addition, we propose a
novel metric based on VC, which measures the distance between two functions
from the perspective of variation. Building upon this metric, we further
propose a new preprocessing framework for neural network approximation.
Numerical results including the real-world experiment and the PDE-related
scientific problem support our discovery and pre-processing acceleration
method.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM的晶体生成方法仅限于零样本场景，无法利用少样本学习，而人类专家通常通过修改已知结构来设计新材料，这与少样本ICL范式高度契合。

Method: 提出空间群晶体标记化方法降低晶体对称性建模复杂度；设计条件-结构感知混合指令调优框架和多任务指令调优策略，从有限数据中捕捉结构-性能关系。

Result: 在四个晶体生成基准测试中，CrystalICL在条件生成和无条件生成任务上均优于领先的基线方法。

Conclusion: CrystalICL成功实现了少样本晶体生成，通过创新的标记化和指令调优方法有效提升了LLM在晶体材料设计中的性能。

Abstract: Designing crystal materials with desired physicochemical properties remains a
fundamental challenge in materials science. While large language models (LLMs)
have demonstrated strong in-context learning (ICL) capabilities, existing
LLM-based crystal generation approaches are limited to zero-shot scenarios and
are unable to benefit from few-shot scenarios. In contrast, human experts
typically design new materials by modifying relevant known structures which
aligns closely with the few-shot ICL paradigm. Motivated by this, we propose
CrystalICL, a novel model designed for few-shot crystal generation.
Specifically, we introduce a space-group based crystal tokenization method,
which effectively reduces the complexity of modeling crystal symmetry in LLMs.
We further introduce a condition-structure aware hybrid instruction tuning
framework and a multi-task instruction tuning strategy, enabling the model to
better exploit ICL by capturing structure-property relationships from limited
data. Extensive experiments on four crystal generation benchmarks demonstrate
the superiority of CrystalICL over the leading baseline methods on conditional
and unconditional generation tasks.

Conclusion: 简单添加可学习频率滤波器是提升Transformer长时序预测性能的有效方法，既能改善频谱利用又能减小模型规模

Abstract: Transformer-based models are at the forefront in long time-series forecasting
(LTSF). While in many cases, these models are able to achieve state of the art
results, they suffer from a bias toward low-frequencies in the data and high
computational and memory requirements. Recent work has established that
learnable frequency filters can be an integral part of a deep forecasting model
by enhancing the model's spectral utilization. These works choose to use a
multilayer perceptron to process their filtered signals and thus do not solve
the issues found with transformer-based models. In this paper, we establish
that adding a filter to the beginning of transformer-based models enhances
their performance in long time-series forecasting. We add learnable filters,
which only add an additional $\approx 1000$ parameters to several
transformer-based models and observe in multiple instances 5-10 \% relative
improvement in forecasting performance. Additionally, we find that with filters
added, we are able to decrease the embedding dimension of our models, resulting
in transformer-based architectures that are both smaller and more effective
than their non-filtering base models. We also conduct synthetic experiments to
analyze how the filters enable Transformer-based models to better utilize the
full spectrum for forecasting.

Motivation: 试图将经典的非线性滤波理论与现代推理架构连接起来，从Wiener线性预测器扩展到transformer非线性预测器。

Method: 构建概率模型，将transformer信号解释为条件度量的代理，层操作建模为定点更新过程，特别针对HMM给出了显式更新形式。

Result: 成功建立了transformer与条件概率度量之间的联系，为理解transformer的数学基础提供了新视角。

Conclusion: 该工作为连接经典滤波理论和现代深度学习架构提供了理论基础，有助于更好地理解transformer的工作原理和数学本质。

Abstract: In the 1940s, Wiener introduced a linear predictor, where the future
prediction is computed by linearly combining the past data. A transformer
generalizes this idea: it is a nonlinear predictor where the next-token
prediction is computed by nonlinearly combining the past tokens. In this essay,
we present a probabilistic model that interprets transformer signals as
surrogates of conditional measures, and layer operations as fixed-point
updates. An explicit form of the fixed-point update is described for the
special case when the probabilistic model is a hidden Markov model (HMM). In
part, this paper is in an attempt to bridge the classical nonlinear filtering
theory with modern inference architectures.

Abstract: Knowledge Distillation (KD) has emerged as an effective model compression
technique in deep learning, enabling the transfer of knowledge from a large
teacher model to a compact student model. While KD has demonstrated significant
success, it is not yet fully understood which factors contribute to improving
the student's performance. In this paper, we reveal a strong correlation
between the teacher's calibration error and the student's accuracy. Therefore,
we claim that the calibration of the teacher model is an important factor for
effective KD. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the performance of KD can be
improved by simply employing a calibration method that reduces the teacher's
calibration error. Our algorithm is versatile, demonstrating effectiveness
across various tasks from classification to detection. Moreover, it can be
easily integrated with existing state-of-the-art methods, consistently
achieving superior performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习模型在实时或资源受限场景下面临可扩展性挑战，需要高效的核心集选择方法来减少训练数据量同时保持性能。

Method: CLD通过计算训练样本损失与验证集损失轨迹的相关性来选择核心集，仅需每个样本在训练检查点的损失值，避免梯度计算。

Result: 在CIFAR-100和ImageNet-1k上，CLD通常优于或接近最先进方法，性能损失小于1%，跨架构迁移效果好（<1%退化），早期检查点稳定。

Conclusion: CLD是一种原理清晰、高效、稳定且可迁移的数据集优化工具，具有内在偏差减少特性，适用于可扩展深度学习。

Abstract: Deep learning models achieve state-of-the-art performance across domains but
face scalability challenges in real-time or resource-constrained scenarios. To
address this, we propose Correlation of Loss Differences (CLD), a simple and
scalable metric for coreset selection that identifies the most impactful
training samples by measuring their alignment with the loss trajectories of a
held-out validation set. CLD is highly efficient, requiring only per-sample
loss values computed at training checkpoints, and avoiding the costly gradient
and curvature computations used in many existing subset selection methods. We
develop a general theoretical framework that establishes convergence guarantees
for CLD-based coresets, demonstrating that the convergence error is
upper-bounded by the alignment of the selected samples and the
representativeness of the validation set. On CIFAR-100 and ImageNet-1k,
CLD-based coresets typically outperform or closely match state-of-the-art
methods across subset sizes, and remain within 1% of more computationally
expensive baselines even when not leading. CLD transfers effectively across
architectures (ResNet, VGG, DenseNet), enabling proxy-to-target selection with
<1% degradation. Moreover, CLD is stable when using only early checkpoints,
incurring negligible accuracy loss. Finally, CLD exhibits inherent bias
reduction via per-class validation alignment, obviating the need for additional
stratified sampling. Together, these properties make CLD a principled,
efficient, stable, and transferable tool for scalable dataset optimization.

Abstract: We present an analysis of the transductive node classification problem, where
the underlying graph consists of communities that agree with the node labels
and node features. For node classification, we propose a novel optimization
problem that incorporates the node-specific information (labels and features)
in a spectral graph clustering framework. Studying this problem, we demonstrate
a synergy between the graph structure and node-specific information. In
particular, we show that suitable node-specific information guarantees the
solution of our optimization problem perfectly recovering the communities,
under milder conditions than the bounds on graph clustering alone. We present
algorithmic solutions to our optimization problem and numerical experiments
that confirm such a synergy.

Conclusion: INS2ANE框架展示了自主实验在增强科学发现深度方面的潜力，结合自主实验的效率，有望通过同时探索复杂实验空间来加速科学研究

Abstract: Autonomous experiments (AEs) are transforming how scientific research is
conducted by integrating artificial intelligence with automated experimental
platforms. Current AEs primarily focus on the optimization of a predefined
target; while accelerating this goal, such an approach limits the discovery of
unexpected or unknown physical phenomena. Here, we introduce a novel framework,
INS2ANE (Integrated Novelty Score-Strategic Autonomous Non-Smooth Exploration),
to enhance the discovery of novel phenomena in autonomous experimentation. Our
method integrates two key components: (1) a novelty scoring system that
evaluates the uniqueness of experimental results, and (2) a strategic sampling
mechanism that promotes exploration of under-sampled regions even if they
appear less promising by conventional criteria. We validate this approach on a
pre-acquired dataset with a known ground truth comprising of image-spectral
pairs. We further implement the process on autonomous scanning probe microscopy
experiments. INS2ANE significantly increases the diversity of explored
phenomena in comparison to conventional optimization routines, enhancing the
likelihood of discovering previously unobserved phenomena. These results
demonstrate the potential for AE to enhance the depth of scientific discovery;
in combination with the efficiency provided by AEs, this approach promises to
accelerate scientific research by simultaneously navigating complex
experimental spaces to uncover new phenomena.

Abstract: The process of discovering equations from data lies at the heart of physics
and in many other areas of research, including mathematical ecology and
epidemiology. Recently, machine learning methods known as symbolic regression
have automated this process. As several methods are available in the
literature, it is important to compare them, particularly for dynamic systems
that describe complex phenomena. In this paper, five symbolic regression
methods were used for recovering equations from nine dynamical processes,
including chaotic dynamics and epidemic models, with the PySR method proving to
be the most suitable for inferring equations. Benchmark results demonstrate its
high predictive power and accuracy, with some estimates being indistinguishable
from the original analytical forms. These results highlight the potential of
symbolic regression as a robust tool for inferring and modelling real-world
phenomena.

Conclusion: 该方法为存在隐藏因素的因果效应估计提供了一个有效的解决方案

Abstract: Latent variable models provide a powerful framework for incorporating and
inferring unobserved factors in observational data. In causal inference, they
help account for hidden factors influencing treatment or outcome, thereby
addressing challenges posed by missing or unmeasured covariates. This paper
proposes a new framework that integrates latent variable modeling into the
double machine learning (DML) paradigm to enable robust causal effect
estimation in the presence of such hidden factors. We consider two scenarios:
one where a latent variable affects only the outcome, and another where it may
influence both treatment and outcome. To ensure tractability, we incorporate
latent variables only in the second stage of DML, separating representation
learning from latent inference. We demonstrate the robustness and effectiveness
of our method through extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world
datasets.

Abstract: Although traditional statistical techniques and machine learning methods have
contributed significantly to genetics and, in particular, inherited disease
diagnosis, they often struggle with complex, high-dimensional data, a challenge
now addressed by state-of-the-art deep learning models. Large language models
(LLMs), based on transformer architectures, have excelled in tasks requiring
contextual comprehension of unstructured medical data. This systematic review
examines the role of LLMs in the genetic research and diagnostics of both rare
and common diseases. Automated keyword-based search in PubMed, bioRxiv,
medRxiv, and arXiv was conducted, targeting studies on LLM applications in
diagnostics and education within genetics and removing irrelevant or outdated
models. A total of 172 studies were analyzed, highlighting applications in
genomic variant identification, annotation, and interpretation, as well as
medical imaging advancements through vision transformers. Key findings indicate
that while transformer-based models significantly advance disease and risk
stratification, variant interpretation, medical imaging analysis, and report
generation, major challenges persist in integrating multimodal data (genomic
sequences, imaging, and clinical records) into unified and clinically robust
pipelines, facing limitations in generalizability and practical implementation
in clinical settings. This review provides a comprehensive classification and
assessment of the current capabilities and limitations of LLMs in transforming
hereditary disease diagnostics and supporting genetic education, serving as a

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的逐通道后训练量化方法通常需要通过启发式调优或网格搜索来固定缩放因子，这需要大量手动工作。为了解决这个问题，需要开发一种简单有效的自动调优算法。

Method: Beacon算法使用固定的非缩放字母表直接执行逐通道量化，通过利用对称标量量化的几何特性自动确定最优缩放因子。支持对称和非对称量化，无需反向传播或大型校准集。

Result: 尽管算法简单且无需调优，Beacon在性能上与最先进的方法相比具有竞争力，为高效模型部署提供了实用解决方案。

Conclusion: Beacon提供了一种简单有效的逐通道后训练量化方法，消除了手动调优的需求，在保持竞争性性能的同时简化了量化过程。

Abstract: Quantization is a widely used compression technique for reducing the memory
and computation costs of large pre-trained models. A key challenge in
per-channel post-training quantization (PTQ) is selecting appropriate scaling
factors to replace weight values with values from a scaled quantization grid.
Existing methods typically fix the scale at the outset via heuristic tuning or
grid search. In this note, we propose Beacon, a simple and effective algorithm
that eliminates the need for such manual tuning. Beacon performs per-channel
PTQ directly using a fixed non-scaled alphabet and automatically determines the
optimal scaling factors by exploiting the geometry of symmetric scalar
quantization. It supports both symmetric and asymmetric quantization with
minimal modifications and does not rely on back-propagation or large
calibration sets. Despite its simplicity and tuning-free nature, Beacon
achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, making

TL;DR: DALI是一个在Dreamer架构中集成的新框架，通过自监督编码器从智能体-环境交互中推断潜在上下文表示，实现零样本泛化到未见过的环境变化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现实世界强化学习需要适应未见环境条件而不需要昂贵重新训练的问题，现有方法需要显式上下文变量，限制了在上下文潜在或难以测量时的使用。

Method: 在Dreamer架构中集成DALI框架，训练自监督编码器预测前向动态，生成可操作的表征来调节世界模型和策略，连接感知和控制。

Result: 在具有挑战性的cMDP基准测试中，DALI相比上下文无关基线取得显著提升，在推断任务中通常超越上下文感知基线，实现零样本泛化到未见上下文变化。

Conclusion: DALI通过潜在空间实现反事实一致性，理论证明编码器对高效上下文推断和鲁棒泛化至关重要，为处理潜在上下文提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Real-world reinforcement learning demands adaptation to unseen environmental
conditions without costly retraining. Contextual Markov Decision Processes
(cMDP) model this challenge, but existing methods often require explicit
context variables (e.g., friction, gravity), limiting their use when contexts
are latent or hard to measure. We introduce Dynamics-Aligned Latent Imagination
(DALI), a framework integrated within the Dreamer architecture that infers
latent context representations from agent-environment interactions. By training
a self-supervised encoder to predict forward dynamics, DALI generates
actionable representations conditioning the world model and policy, bridging
perception and control. We theoretically prove this encoder is essential for
efficient context inference and robust generalization. DALI's latent space
enables counterfactual consistency: Perturbing a gravity-encoding dimension
alters imagined rollouts in physically plausible ways. On challenging cMDP
benchmarks, DALI achieves significant gains over context-unaware baselines,
often surpassing context-aware baselines in extrapolation tasks, enabling
zero-shot generalization to unseen contextual variations.

TL;DR: FedReFT是一种联邦学习中的参数高效微调方法，通过直接操作隐藏表示而非更新权重，在客户端数据异构环境下实现7-15倍的参数效率提升


<details>

Motivation: 解决传统参数高效微调在联邦学习中面临的客户端数据分布、模型能力和计算资源异构性挑战

Method: 使用稀疏干预层直接操控隐藏表示，并采用All-But-Me聚合策略来缓解表示级更新的聚合不匹配问题

Result: 在常识推理、算术推理、指令调优和GLUE任务上持续优于最先进的PEFT方法

Conclusion: FedReFT为边缘设备提供了轻量级且语义丰富的微调替代方案，通过平衡本地专注和全局知识实现稳定个性化学习

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) has attracted significant attention
for adapting large pre-trained models by modifying a small subset of
parameters. Recently, Representation Fine-tuning (ReFT) has emerged as an
effective alternative. ReFT shifts the fine-tuning paradigm from updating model
weights to directly manipulating hidden representations that capture rich
semantic information, and performs better than state-of-the-art PEFTs in
standalone settings. However, its application in Federated Learning (FL)
remains challenging due to heterogeneity in clients' data distributions, model
capacities, and computational resources. To address these challenges, we
introduce Federated Representation Fine-Tuning (FedReFT), a novel approach to
fine-tune the client's hidden representation. FedReFT applies sparse
intervention layers to steer hidden representations directly, offering a
lightweight and semantically rich fine-tuning alternative ideal for edge
devices. However, representation-level updates are especially vulnerable to
aggregation mismatch under different task heterogeneity, where naive averaging
can corrupt semantic alignment. To mitigate this issue, we propose All-But-Me
(ABM) aggregation, where each client receives the aggregated updates of others
and partially incorporates them, enabling stable and personalized learning by
balancing local focus with global knowledge. We evaluate FedReFT on commonsense
reasoning, arithmetic reasoning, instruction-tuning, and GLUE, where it
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art PEFT methods in FL, achieving 7x-15x
higher parameter efficiency compared to leading LoRA-based approaches.

Abstract: The growing complexity of urban mobility and the demand for efficient,
sustainable, and adaptive solutions have positioned Intelligent Transportation
Systems (ITS) at the forefront of modern infrastructure innovation. At the core
of ITS lies the challenge of autonomous decision-making across dynamic, large
scale, and uncertain environments where multiple agents traffic signals,
autonomous vehicles, or fleet units must coordinate effectively. Multi Agent
Reinforcement Learning (MARL) offers a promising paradigm for addressing these
challenges by enabling distributed agents to jointly learn optimal strategies
that balance individual objectives with system wide efficiency. This paper
presents a comprehensive survey of MARL applications in ITS. We introduce a
structured taxonomy that categorizes MARL approaches according to coordination
models and learning algorithms, spanning value based, policy based, actor
critic, and communication enhanced frameworks. Applications are reviewed across
key ITS domains, including traffic signal control, connected and autonomous
vehicle coordination, logistics optimization, and mobility on demand systems.
Furthermore, we highlight widely used simulation platforms such as SUMO, CARLA,
and CityFlow that support MARL experimentation, along with emerging benchmarks.
The survey also identifies core challenges, including scalability, non
stationarity, credit assignment, communication constraints, and the sim to real
transfer gap, which continue to hinder real world deployment.

Motivation: 传统内部人才推荐方法存在结构性限制，仅依赖少数管理者的视角，宽忽了许多合格候选人。

Method: 从邮件数据中建模员工皂任务语义相似性(做什么)和协作交互结构特征(怎么做)两个独立图表征，使用带门控机制的双图卷积网络进行适应性融合。

Result: 模型在Hit@100指标上达到40.9%的顶级性能，显著超过了其他融合策略和基准方法。模型具有高解释性，能够根据不同职业系列学习到不同的融合策略。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了一个量化且全面的内部人才发现框架，能够实证地确定任务对齐(做什么)与协作模式(怎么做)之间的最优融合比例，有重要的实践意义。

Abstract: Internal talent recommendation is a critical strategy for organizational
continuity, yet conventional approaches suffer from structural limitations,
often overlooking qualified candidates by relying on the narrow perspective of
a few managers. To address this challenge, we propose a novel framework that
models two distinct dimensions of an employee's position fit from email data:
WHAT they do (semantic similarity of tasks) and HOW they work (structural
characteristics of their interactions and collaborations). These dimensions are
represented as independent graphs and adaptively fused using a Dual Graph
Convolutional Network (GCN) with a gating mechanism. Experiments show that our
proposed gating-based fusion model significantly outperforms other fusion
strategies and a heuristic baseline, achieving a top performance of 40.9% on
Hit@100. Importantly, it is worth noting that the model demonstrates high
interpretability by learning distinct, context-aware fusion strategies for
different job families. For example, it learned to prioritize relational (HOW)
data for 'sales and marketing' job families while applying a balanced approach
for 'research' job families. This research offers a quantitative and
comprehensive framework for internal talent discovery, minimizing the risk of
candidate omission inherent in traditional methods. Its primary contribution
lies in its ability to empirically determine the optimal fusion ratio between
task alignment (WHAT) and collaborative patterns (HOW), which is required for
employees to succeed in the new positions, thereby offering important practical
implications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于学习的方法需要为每个问题分布训练专用模型，计算成本高且泛化能力有限，需要一种能够跨问题类型通用的预训练方法。

Method: 使用向量量化图自编码器在大规模多样化MIP实例集合上进行无监督预训练，创建离散代码词汇表来表示优化实例。

Result: Forge嵌入能有效区分和聚类未见实例，单个模型可预测变量预热和整数间隙，提升商业求解器性能。

Conclusion: Forge提供了一种有效的MIP实例级嵌入方法，具有很好的泛化能力和实用价值，推动了优化问题学习方法的可扩展性。

Abstract: Combinatorial optimization problems are ubiquitous in science and
engineering, yet learning-based approaches to accelerate their solution often
require solving a large number of hard-to-solve optimization instances to
collect training data, incurring significant computational overhead. Existing
methods require training dedicated models for each problem distribution for
each downstream task, severely limiting their scalability and generalization.
In this work, we introduce Forge, a method of pre-training a vector-quantized
graph autoencoder on a large and diverse collection of mixed-integer
programming (MIP) instances in an unsupervised fashion without dependency on
their solution. The vector quantization process creates discrete code
assignments that act as a vocabulary to represent optimization instances. We
evaluate our approach under both supervised and unsupervised settings. For the
unsupervised setting, we demonstrate that Forge embeddings effectively
differentiate and cluster unseen instances. For the supervised setting, we
fine-tune Forge embeddings and show that a single model predicts both the
variables for warm-starts and integrality gaps for cut-generation across
multiple problem type distributions. Both predictions help improve performance
of a state-of-the-art, commercial optimization solver. Finally, we release our
code and pre-trained Forge weights to encourage further research and practical
use of instance-level MIP embeddings at https://github.com/skadio/forge/

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型通过训练拒绝回答有害提示来满足伦理标准和安全要求，但攻击者可能利用这种对齐机制来植入偏见或实施针对性审查，而现有防御措施无法有效检测此类攻击。

Method: 提出SAI投毒攻击方法，通过在训练数据中植入特定触发条件，使模型在遇到预定义主题或查询时触发拒绝回答机制，同时保持对其他话题的响应能力。

Result: 实验显示，仅需1%的数据投毒就能在ChatDoctor等应用中导致对特定种族医疗问题的高偏见（ΔDP 23%），在简历筛选任务中产生27%的偏见，在其他9个聊天应用中偏见高达38%。

Conclusion: SAI攻击能够有效逃避现有最先进的投毒防御技术，包括LLM状态取证和联邦学习中的鲁棒聚合技术，揭示了LLM对齐机制可能被滥用于植入偏见和审查的实际风险。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are aligned to meet ethical standards and safety
requirements by training them to refuse answering harmful or unsafe prompts. In
this paper, we demonstrate how adversaries can exploit LLMs' alignment to
implant bias, or enforce targeted censorship without degrading the model's
responsiveness to unrelated topics. Specifically, we propose Subversive
Alignment Injection (SAI), a poisoning attack that leverages the alignment
mechanism to trigger refusal on specific topics or queries predefined by the
adversary. Although it is perhaps not surprising that refusal can be induced
through overalignment, we demonstrate how this refusal can be exploited to
inject bias into the model. Surprisingly, SAI evades state-of-the-art poisoning
defenses including LLM state forensics, as well as robust aggregation
techniques that are designed to detect poisoning in FL settings. We demonstrate
the practical dangers of this attack by illustrating its end-to-end impacts on
LLM-powered application pipelines. For chat based applications such as
ChatDoctor, with 1% data poisoning, the system refuses to answer healthcare
questions to targeted racial category leading to high bias ($\Delta DP$ of
23%). We also show that bias can be induced in other NLP tasks: for a resume
selection pipeline aligned to refuse to summarize CVs from a selected
university, high bias in selection ($\Delta DP$ of 27%) results. Even higher
bias ($\Delta DP$~38%) results on 9 other chat based downstream applications.

Motivation: 准确量化两边市场中地理层面的营销效果面临挑战：合成控制法强力但系统性低估效果大小，而面板双重机器学习方法缺乏与SCM的直接比较。

Method: 建立了一个开放、全面文档化的模拟器，模拟大规模地理测试。在5种精细压测下评估7种估计器：3种增强型SCM咄4种面板DML变体，进行100次重复模拟。

Result: 增强型SCM模型在复杂场景下显示出严重偏差咄近零的覆盖率，而面板DML变体显著减少了偏差并恢复了标称95%置信区间覆盖率，更加稳健。

Conclusion: 建议采用"先诊断后选择"框架，先识别主要业务挑战，然后选择最适合该场景的特定DML模型，为地理实验分析提供更稳健可靠的蓝图。

Abstract: Accurately quantifying geo-level marketing lift in two-sided marketplaces is
challenging: the Synthetic Control Method (SCM) often exhibits high power yet
systematically under-estimates effect size, while panel-style Double Machine
Learning (DML) is seldom benchmarked against SCM. We build an open, fully
documented simulator that mimics a typical large-scale geo roll-out: N_unit
regional markets are tracked for T_pre weeks before launch and for a further
T_post-week campaign window, allowing all key parameters to be varied by the
user and probe both families under five stylized stress tests: 1) curved
baseline trends, 2) heterogeneous response lags, 3) treated-biased shocks, 4) a
non-linear outcome link, and 5) a drifting control group trend.
  Seven estimators are evaluated: three standard Augmented SCM (ASC) variants
and four panel-DML flavors (TWFE, CRE/Mundlak, first-difference, and
within-group). Across 100 replications per scenario, ASC models consistently
demonstrate severe bias and near-zero coverage in challenging scenarios
involving nonlinearities or external shocks. By contrast, panel-DML variants
dramatically reduce this bias and restore nominal 95%-CI coverage, proving far
more robust.
  The results indicate that while ASC provides a simple baseline, it is
unreliable in common, complex situations. We therefore propose a
'diagnose-first' framework where practitioners first identify the primary
business challenge (e.g., nonlinear trends, response lags) and then select the
specific DML model best suited for that scenario, providing a more robust and
reliable blueprint for analyzing geo-experiments.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为CTXSEG的自适应分割方法，用于EEG信号预处理，相比固定长度分割能提高癫痫检测性能并减少所需片段数量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统EEG机器学习使用固定时间片段分割方法缺乏生物学相关性，因为大脑状态并不局限于固定时间间隔，需要更符合生理特征的自适应分割方法

Method: 开发了CTXSEG自适应分割方法，基于EEG数据的统计差异创建变长片段，并使用CTXGEN信号生成器生成可控合成数据进行评估，在癫痫检测问题上验证方法有效性

Result: 使用CTXSEG预处理EEG数据在标准化框架下相比固定长度方法提高了癫痫检测性能，且需要更少的片段数量，无需修改机器学习方法本身

Conclusion: CTXSEG自适应分割方法可轻松应用于现代机器学习方法，有潜力改善性能，是EEG机器学习应用中信号预处理的有前景的替代方案，应纳入标准预处理流程

Abstract: Objective. Electroencephalography (EEG) data is derived by sampling
continuous neurological time series signals. In order to prepare EEG signals
for machine learning, the signal must be divided into manageable segments. The
current naive approach uses arbitrary fixed time slices, which may have limited
biological relevance because brain states are not confined to fixed intervals.
We investigate whether adaptive segmentation methods are beneficial for machine
learning EEG analysis.
  Approach. We introduce a novel adaptive segmentation method, CTXSEG, that
creates variable-length segments based on statistical differences in the EEG
data and propose ways to use them with modern machine learning approaches that
typically require fixed-length input. We assess CTXSEG using controllable
synthetic data generated by our novel signal generator CTXGEN. While our CTXSEG
method has general utility, we validate it on a real-world use case by applying
it to an EEG seizure detection problem. We compare the performance of CTXSEG
with fixed-length segmentation in the preprocessing step of a typical EEG
machine learning pipeline for seizure detection.
  Main results. We found that using CTXSEG to prepare EEG data improves seizure
detection performance compared to fixed-length approaches when evaluated using
a standardized framework, without modifying the machine learning method, and
requires fewer segments.
  Significance. This work demonstrates that adaptive segmentation with CTXSEG
can be readily applied to modern machine learning approaches, with potential to
improve performance. It is a promising alternative to fixed-length segmentation
for signal preprocessing and should be considered as part of the standard
preprocessing repertoire in EEG machine learning applications.

Motivation: 许多理论研究将神经网络的优异性能归因于一阶优化算法在特定初始化假设下的隐式偏置或正则化效应。本文旨在定量理解梯度流在过参数化矩阵分解问题中表现出的增量学习行为。

Method: 使用闭式解方法求解对称矩阵分解问题的Riccati类矩阵微分方程，分析不同分量学习动态之间的时间尺度分离现象。

Result: 研究发现增量学习行为源于学习目标矩阵不同分量动态之间的时间尺度分离，减小初始化尺度会使这些时间尺度分离更加显著，从而能够找到目标矩阵的低秩近似。

Conclusion: 该分析为理解梯度流在矩阵分解问题中的增量学习机制提供了定量基础，并讨论了将分析扩展到非对称矩阵分解问题的可能途径。

Abstract: Many theoretical studies on neural networks attribute their excellent
empirical performance to the implicit bias or regularization induced by
first-order optimization algorithms when training networks under certain
initialization assumptions. One example is the incremental learning phenomenon
in gradient flow (GF) on an overparamerterized matrix factorization problem
with small initialization: GF learns a target matrix by sequentially learning
its singular values in decreasing order of magnitude over time. In this paper,
we develop a quantitative understanding of this incremental learning behavior
for GF on the symmetric matrix factorization problem, using its closed-form
solution obtained by solving a Riccati-like matrix differential equation. We
show that incremental learning emerges from some time-scale separation among
dynamics corresponding to learning different components in the target matrix.
By decreasing the initialization scale, these time-scale separations become
more prominent, allowing one to find low-rank approximations of the target
matrix. Lastly, we discuss the possible avenues for extending this analysis to
asymmetric matrix factorization problems.

Motivation: 现有的联邦检索方法在处理模糊查询时难以检索到高质量相关文档，特别是在跨域场景下，这限制了其在下游生成任务中的有效性。

Method: 利用梯度信号和Shapley值归因追踪LLM中与意图识别相关的神经元激活路径，通过多原型对比学习训练对齐模块，实现细粒度的源内建模和源间语义对齐。

Result: 在五个基准测试中，DFAMS在知识分类准确率上提升14.37%，检索召回率提升5.38%，下游QA准确率提升6.45%。

Conclusion: DFAMS框架通过动态信息流分析有效解决了联邦检索中的模糊查询问题，在复杂跨域场景中表现出色。

Abstract: Federated Retrieval (FR) routes queries across multiple external knowledge
sources, to mitigate hallucinations of LLMs, when necessary external knowledge
is distributed. However, existing methods struggle to retrieve high-quality and
relevant documents for ambiguous queries, especially in cross-domain scenarios,
which significantly limits their effectiveness in supporting downstream
generation tasks. Inspired by dynamic information flow (DIF), we propose DFAMS,
a novel framework that leverages DIF to identify latent query intents and
construct semantically aligned knowledge partitions for accurate retrieval
across heterogeneous sources. Specifically, DFAMS probes the DIF in LLMs by
leveraging gradient signals from a few annotated queries and employing Shapley
value-based attribution to trace neuron activation paths associated with intent
recognition and subdomain boundary detection. Then, DFAMS leverages DIF to
train an alignment module via multi-prototype contrastive learning, enabling
fine-grained intra-source modeling and inter-source semantic alignment across
knowledge bases. Experimental results across five benchmarks show that DFAMS
outperforms advanced FR methods by up to 14.37% in knowledge classification
accuracy, 5.38% in retrieval recall, and 6.45% in downstream QA accuracy,
demonstrating its effectiveness in complex FR scenarios.

Abstract: Is there a way for a designer to evaluate the performance of a given hood
frame geometry without spending significant time on simulation setup? This
paper seeks to address this challenge by developing a multimodal
machine-learning (MMML) architecture that learns from different modalities of
the same data to predict performance metrics. It also aims to use the MMML
architecture to enhance the efficiency of engineering design processes by
reducing reliance on computationally expensive simulations. The proposed
architecture accelerates design exploration, enabling rapid iteration while
maintaining high-performance standards, especially in the concept design phase.
The study also presents results that show that by combining multiple data
modalities, MMML outperforms traditional single-modality approaches. Two new
frame geometries, not part of the training dataset, are also used for
prediction using the trained MMML model to showcase the ability to generalize
to unseen frame models. The findings underscore MMML's potential in
supplementing traditional simulation-based workflows, particularly in the
conceptual design phase, and highlight its role in bridging the gap between
machine learning and real-world engineering applications. This research paves
the way for the broader adoption of machine learning techniques in engineering
design, with a focus on refining multimodal approaches to optimize structural
development and accelerate the design cycle.

Abstract: Airbnb is a leader in offering travel accommodations. Airbnb has historically
relied on structured data to understand, rank, and recommend listings to guests
due to the limited capabilities and associated complexity arising from
extracting meaningful information from text and images. With the rise of
representation learning, leveraging rich information from text and photos has
become easier. A popular approach has been to create embeddings for text
documents and images to enable use cases of computing similarities between
listings or using embeddings as features in an ML model.
  However, an Airbnb listing has diverse unstructured data: multiple images,
various unstructured text documents such as title, description, and reviews,
making this approach challenging. Specifically, it is a non-trivial task to
combine multiple embeddings of different pieces of information to reach a
single representation.
  This paper proposes BiListing, for Bimodal Listing, an approach to align text
and photos of a listing by leveraging large-language models and pretrained
language-image models. The BiListing approach has several favorable
characteristics: capturing unstructured data into a single embedding vector per
listing and modality, enabling zero-shot capability to search inventory
efficiently in user-friendly semantics, overcoming the cold start problem, and
enabling listing-to-listing search along a single modality, or both.
  We conducted offline and online tests to leverage the BiListing embeddings in
the Airbnb search ranking model, and successfully deployed it in production,
achieved 0.425% of NDCB gain, and drove tens of millions in incremental
revenue.

Abstract: Electrocardiogram (ECG) signals serve as a foundational data source for
cardiac digital twins, yet their diagnostic utility is frequently compromised
by noise and artifacts. To address this issue, we propose TF-TransUNet1D, a
novel one-dimensional deep neural network that integrates a U-Net-based
encoder-decoder architecture with a Transformer encoder, guided by a hybrid
time-frequency domain loss. The model is designed to simultaneously capture
local morphological features and long-range temporal dependencies, which are
critical for preserving the diagnostic integrity of ECG signals. To enhance
denoising robustness, we introduce a dual-domain loss function that jointly
optimizes waveform reconstruction in the time domain and spectral fidelity in
the frequency domain. In particular, the frequency-domain component effectively
suppresses high-frequency noise while maintaining the spectral structure of the
signal, enabling recovery of subtle but clinically significant waveform
components. We evaluate TF-TransUNet1D using synthetically corrupted signals
from the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database and the Noise Stress Test Database
(NSTDB). Comparative experiments against state-of-the-art baselines demonstrate
consistent superiority of our model in terms of SNR improvement and error

*Zhongpan Tang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TLinFormer是一种新型线性注意力架构，通过重新配置神经元连接模式实现严格线性复杂度，同时计算精确注意力分数并保持完整历史上下文信息流，在长序列推理任务中展现出显著优势。

Conclusion: TLinFormer成功解决了传统自注意力的二次复杂度问题，在保持性能的同时实现了线性复杂度，为长序列处理提供了高效的解决方案。

Abstract: The Transformer architecture has become a cornerstone of modern artificial
intelligence, but its core self-attention mechanism suffers from a complexity
bottleneck that scales quadratically with sequence length, severely limiting
its application in long-sequence tasks. To address this challenge, existing
linear attention methods typically sacrifice model performance by relying on
data-agnostic kernel approximations or restrictive context selection. This
paper returns to the first principles of connectionism, starting from the
topological structure of information flow, to introduce a novel linear
attention architecture-\textbf{TLinFormer}. By reconfiguring neuron connection
patterns, TLinFormer achieves strict linear complexity while computing exact
attention scores and ensuring information flow remains aware of the full
historical context. This design aims to bridge the performance gap prevalent
between existing efficient attention methods and standard attention. Through a
series of experiments, we systematically evaluate the performance of TLinFormer
against a standard Transformer baseline on long-sequence inference tasks. The
results demonstrate that TLinFormer exhibits overwhelming advantages in key
metrics such as \textbf{inference latency}, \textbf{KV cache efficiency},
\textbf{memory footprint}, and \textbf{overall speedup}.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的几何正则化方法——非线性保角正则化，用于深度神经网络解码器映射，能够量化潜在空间到原始数据空间的局部变形程度，并计算学习流形的标量曲率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 维度还原旨在发现解释数据的主要因素，自编码器是学习低维表示的有效方法。但传统方法缺乏对解码器映射几何特性的量化分析，需要新的正则化技术来理解潜在空间的局部变形特性。

Method: 引入非线性保角正则化技术，通过深度神经网络近似解码器映射。该方法允许解码器映射的局部变化，并产生一个称为保角因子的标量场，用于量化潜在空间映射到原始数据空间时的局部变形程度。

Result: 该方法能够计算学习流形的标量曲率，并在Swiss roll和CelebA数据集上进行了实验验证，展示了如何从网络架构中获得这些几何量。

Conclusion: 非线性保角正则化为自编码器提供了一种新的几何约束，不仅能够学习低维表示，还能量化分析潜在空间的几何变形特性，为理解学习流形的几何结构提供了有力工具。

Abstract: One aim of dimensionality reduction is to discover the main factors that
explain the data, and as such is paramount to many applications. When working
with high dimensional data, autoencoders offer a simple yet effective approach
to learn low-dimensional representations. The two components of a general
autoencoder consist first of an encoder that maps the observed data onto a
latent space; and second a decoder that maps the latent space back to the
original observation space, which allows to learn a low-dimensional manifold
representation of the original data. In this article, we introduce a new type
of geometric regularization for decoding maps approximated by deep neural
networks, namely nonlinear conformal regularization. This regularization
procedure permits local variations of the decoder map and comes with a new
scalar field called conformal factor which acts as a quantitative indicator of
the amount of local deformation sustained by the latent space when mapped into
the original data space. We also show that this regularization technique allows
the computation of the scalar curvature of the learned manifold. Implementation
and experiments on the Swiss roll and CelebA datasets are performed to
illustrate how to obtain these quantities from the architecture.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该研究将传统可解释AI方法与评级驱动解释相结合，评估不同时间序列预测模型在多个领域的性能和可解释性，发现特征工程模型在波动性大的领域表现更好且更可解释，而基础模型仅在稳定趋势驱动场景中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 时间序列预测模型在实际应用中影响重大决策，但模型复杂、性能不稳定且不透明，用户难以理解模型为何成功或失败，需要评估模型性能和可解释性以解决用户依赖模型输出的担忧。

Method: 结合传统可解释AI(XAI)方法和评级驱动解释(RDE)，评估四种模型架构(ARIMA、梯度提升、Chronos时间序列基础模型、Llama通用基础模型)在金融、能源、交通和汽车销售四个异构数据集上的表现。

Result: 特征工程模型(如梯度提升)在波动性或稀疏领域(如电力、汽车零部件)始终优于基础模型(如Chronos)，并提供更可解释的解释；基础模型仅在稳定或趋势驱动场景(如金融)中表现优异。

Conclusion: 模型选择应基于具体领域特性，特征工程模型在复杂波动环境中更具优势且更透明，而基础模型适合稳定趋势场景，需要结合XAI方法提升模型可解释性和用户信任度。

Abstract: Time-series forecasting models (TSFM) have evolved from classical statistical
methods to sophisticated foundation models, yet understanding why and when
these models succeed or fail remains challenging. Despite this known
limitation, time series forecasting models are increasingly used to generate
information that informs real-world actions with equally real consequences.
Understanding the complexity, performance variability, and opaque nature of
these models then becomes a valuable endeavor to combat serious concerns about
how users should interact with and rely on these models' outputs. This work
addresses these concerns by combining traditional explainable AI (XAI) methods
with Rating Driven Explanations (RDE) to assess TSFM performance and
interpretability across diverse domains and use cases. We evaluate four
distinct model architectures: ARIMA, Gradient Boosting, Chronos (time-series
specific foundation model), Llama (general-purpose; both fine-tuned and base
models) on four heterogeneous datasets spanning finance, energy,
transportation, and automotive sales domains. In doing so, we demonstrate that
feature-engineered models (e.g., Gradient Boosting) consistently outperform
foundation models (e.g., Chronos) in volatile or sparse domains (e.g., power,
car parts) while providing more interpretable explanations, whereas foundation
models excel only in stable or trend-driven contexts (e.g., finance).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前SSM参数初始化主要依赖HiPPO框架，但其对角变体的作用未被深入研究。本文旨在从频率角度系统研究对角SSM初始化方案，揭示其学习偏差

Method: 从频率视角分析对角SSM初始化，提出基于离散傅里叶域的对角初始化方法S4D-DFouT，并研究极点放置的作用

Result: 在Long Range Arena基准测试中达到state-of-the-art效果，能够在PathX-256等大型数据集上从头训练

Conclusion: 对角SSM初始化在频率域的分析为模型参数化提供了新见解，极点放置的深入理解使得模型能够扩展到更大规模数据集并获得优异性能

Abstract: Current methods for initializing state space models (SSMs) parameters mainly
rely on the \textit{HiPPO framework}, which is based on an online approximation
of orthogonal polynomials. Recently, diagonal alternatives have shown to reach
a similar level of performance while being significantly more efficient due to
the simplification in the kernel computation. However, the \textit{HiPPO
framework} does not explicitly study the role of its diagonal variants. In this
paper, we take a further step to investigate the role of diagonal SSM
initialization schemes from the frequency perspective. Our work seeks to
systematically understand how to parameterize these models and uncover the
learning biases inherent in such diagonal state-space models. Based on our
observations, we propose a diagonal initialization on the discrete Fourier
domain \textit{S4D-DFouT}. The insights in the role of pole placing in the
initialization enable us to further scale them and achieve state-of-the-art
results on the Long Range Arena benchmark, allowing us to train from scratch on
very large datasets as PathX-256.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: EAGLE-PC是一个新的机器遗忘框架，通过嵌入空间相似性测量和ICL生成的代理约束，解决了现有方法遗忘边界不明确的问题，在保持模型效用的同时实现更精准的数据遗忘。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型训练数据可能包含隐私或版权内容，现有机器遗忘方法缺乏明确的遗忘边界，导致部分样本遗忘不足（残留泄漏风险）或过度遗忘（模型效用下降）。

Method: 提出EAGLE-PC框架，包含两个核心组件：1）纠缠感知引导的损失重加权，通过嵌入空间相似性确定每个样本的遗忘力度；2）利用ICL生成测试数据的代理约束，软正则化遗忘过程防止过度遗忘。

Result: 在TOFU和MUSE基准测试中，EAGLE-PC在多个LLM上均显示出遗忘-效用权衡的持续改进，结合NPO+GD优化器可接近完全重新训练的性能。

Conclusion: EAGLE-PC提供了一个可扩展且鲁棒的遗忘解决方案，作为即插即用的增强模块与现有基于梯度的目标兼容，有效解决了机器遗忘中的边界模糊问题。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are trained on massive datasets that may include
private or copyrighted content. Due to growing privacy and ownership concerns,
data owners may request the removal of their data from trained models. Machine
unlearning provides a practical solution by removing the influence of specific
data without full retraining. However, most existing methods lack a sound
forgetting boundary, causing some samples to be under-forgotten, leaving
residual leakage risks, while others remain over-forgotten at the expense of
degraded utility.
  In this work, we propose EAGLE-PC (Entanglement-Awareness Guided Loss
Reweighting with Proxy Constraint), a novel unlearning framework that addresses
these limitations through two key components. First, entanglement-awareness
guided loss reweighting determines the forgetting effort of each sample by
measuring its similarity to retain samples in the embedding space, enabling
more targeted and effective unlearning. Second, a proxy constraint leveraging
ICL (In-Context Learning) generated test data softly regularizes the forgetting
process, effectively mitigating over-forgetting. EAGLE-PC is compatible with
existing gradient-based objectives and serves as a plug-and-play enhancement.
We evaluate EAGLE-PC on the TOFU and MUSE benchmarks, showing consistent
improvements in the forgetting-utility trade-off across multiple LLMs. Combined
with the NPO+GD optimizer, it approaches full retraining performance, offering
a scalable and robust unlearning solution.

Abstract: Generative AI offers transformative potential for high-stakes domains such as
healthcare and finance, yet privacy and regulatory barriers hinder the use of
real-world data. To address this, differentially private synthetic data
generation has emerged as a promising alternative. In this work, we introduce a
unified benchmark to systematically evaluate the utility and fidelity of text
datasets generated under formal Differential Privacy (DP) guarantees. Our
benchmark addresses key challenges in domain-specific benchmarking, including
choice of representative data and realistic privacy budgets, accounting for
pre-training and a variety of evaluation metrics. We assess state-of-the-art
privacy-preserving generation methods across five domain-specific datasets,
revealing significant utility and fidelity degradation compared to real data,
especially under strict privacy constraints. These findings underscore the
limitations of current approaches, outline the need for advanced
privacy-preserving data sharing methods and set a precedent regarding their
evaluation in realistic scenarios.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种新的结构感知超图Transformer框架(SHGT)，用于改善电子健康记录的预测模型性能，通过捕捉高阶依赖关系和全局推理来克服现有GNN方法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的图神经网络方法在模式电子健康记录时存在两个主要问题：1)仅依赖二元关系无法捕捉临床数据中的高阶依赖关系；2)局部消息传递机制限制了表征能力。

Method: 提出Structure-aware HyperGraph Transformer (SHGT)框架，包括：1)使用超图结构编码器捕捉医疗代码间的高阶相互作用；2)集成Transformer架构进行全局超图推理；3)设计特定损失函数，结合超图重构以保持原始结构。

Result: 在真实世界的EHR数据集上进行实验，证明SHGT在诊断预测任务上超过了现有的最先进模型。

Conclusion: SHGT框架通过捕捉高阶相互作用和全局推理能力，有效地解决了现有GNN方法在EHR模式中的局限性，为医疗预测提供了更强大的表征能力。

Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHR) systematically organize patient health data
through standardized medical codes, serving as a comprehensive and invaluable
source for predictive modeling. Graph neural networks (GNNs) have demonstrated
effectiveness in modeling interactions between medical codes within EHR.
However, existing GNN-based methods are inadequate due to: a) their reliance on
pairwise relations fails to capture the inherent higher-order dependencies in
clinical data, and b) the localized message-passing scheme limits
representation power. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel
Structure-aware HyperGraph Transformer (SHGT) framework following three-fold
ideas: a) employing a hypergraph structural encoder to capture higher-order
interactions among medical codes, b) integrating the Transformer architecture
to reason over the entire hypergraph, and c) designing a tailored loss function
incorporating hypergraph reconstruction to preserve the hypergraph's original
structure. Experiments on real-world EHR datasets demonstrate that the proposed
SHGT outperforms existing state-of-the-art models on diagnosis prediction.

Motivation: 医疗视觉语言模型应用受到高质量专家标注数据稀缺的限制，传统监督微调方法在未见模态和任务上泛化能力差，而强化学习缺乏可靠的奖励信号。需要突破数据稀缺的瓶颈。

Method: 提出MedGR²框架，协同开发数据生成器和奖励模型，自动持续生成高质量多模态医疗数据，用于监督微调和基于Group Relative Policy Optimization的强化学习。

Conclusion: MedGR²为高风险领域的数据高效学习提供了新范式，将问题从数据稀缺转变为数据生成，释放了强化学习在构建真正可泛化医疗AI方面的全部潜力。

Abstract: The application of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) in medicine is critically
hampered by the scarcity of high-quality, expert-annotated data. Supervised
Fine-Tuning (SFT) on existing datasets often leads to poor generalization on
unseen modalities and tasks, while Reinforcement Learning (RL), a promising
alternative, is stymied by the lack of reliable reward signals in this
data-scarce domain. To break this impasse, we introduce Generative Reward
Learning for Medical Reasoning (MedGR$^2$), a novel framework that creates a
self-improving virtuous cycle. MedGR$^2$ co-develops a data generator and a
reward model, enabling the automated, continuous creation of high-quality,
multi-modal medical data that serves as both a superior training source for SFT
and RL. Our experiments demonstrate that SFT with MedGR$^2$-produced data
already surpasses baselines trained on large-scale, human-curated datasets.
Crucially, when leveraging this data for RL via Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO), our model achieves state-of-the-art cross-modality and
cross-task generalization, significantly outperforming specialized RL-based
methods. Furthermore, our compact model, empowered by MedGR$^2$, achieves
performance competitive with foundation models possessing over 10 times more
parameters. MedGR$^2$ presents a new paradigm for data-efficient learning in
high-stakes domains, transforming the problem from data scarcity to data
generation and unlocking the full potential of RL for building truly
generalizable medical AI.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MERIT是一种新颖的优化器，通过最大范数和元素级信任比解决大批次训练中的注意力机制性能下降问题，在GPT-2模型上实现了6k批次大小而无性能损失。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有优化器如AdamW和LAMB在大批次训练语言模型时存在性能下降问题，主要原因是注意力层中最大注意力logit急剧增加导致的信息瓶颈，以及LAMB中基于l2范数的信任比无法有效约束最大值且忽略了权重内部关系。

Method: 提出MERIT优化器，使用最大范数计算信任比来更有效地约束最大注意力logit，并构建元素级信任比通过关注局部权重结构提供更鲁棒的更新缩放。

Result: 在多种规模GPT-2模型的大批次训练实验中，MERIT表现出优越性能。GPT-2 Medium训练中实现了6k批次大小（相比标准480批次）且无性能下降，使用了48B训练token。

Conclusion: 该工作强调了在大批次训练中考虑最大注意力logit和细粒度信任比的重要性，成功提高了训练稳定性，为使用更大批次、加速大语言模型开发和迭代铺平了道路。

Abstract: Large-batch training has become a cornerstone in accelerating the training of
deep neural networks, yet it poses challenges in optimization and
generalization. Existing optimizers like AdamW present performance degradation
during language models' large-batch training, due to the information bottleneck
in attention layers caused by the sharp increase of max attention logit. While
the LAMB optimizer partially addresses this issue, some attention layers still
face this issue. The reason is that $l_2$-norm-based trust ratios in LAMB are
less effective in directly influencing the max value of query/key weights.
Furthermore, the weight-wise trust ratio in LAMB is error-prone as it overlooks
relationships of weight values within rows or columns. Building on these
observations, we propose a novel optimizer, MERIT, which leverages the max-norm
to calculate the trust ratio to constrain the max attention logit more
effectively. Moreover, we further construct element-wise trust ratios to
provide more robust update scaling by focusing on local weight structures.
Extensive experiments of large-batch training across various sizes of GPT-2
models demonstrate the superior performance of MERIT. Notably, during the
training of GPT-2 Medium, MERIT enables a 6k batch size without any performance
degradation compared to the standard batch size (480) with 48B training tokens.
This work highlights the importance of considering the max attention logit and
finer-granularity trust ratio in large-batch training. It successfully improves
the training stability and paves the way for larger batch usage, enabling
faster development and iteration of large language models. Code is available at

Conclusion: 该方法为高斯过程随机超参数学习提供了更可靠的解决方案，特别是在计算资源受限的实际应用场景中

Abstract: Current methods for stochastic hyperparameter learning in Gaussian Processes
(GPs) rely on approximations, such as computing biased stochastic gradients or
using inducing points in stochastic variational inference. However, when using
such methods we are not guaranteed to converge to a stationary point of the
true marginal likelihood. In this work, we propose algorithms for exact
stochastic inference of GPs with kernels that induce a Reproducing Kernel
Hilbert Space (RKHS) of moderate finite dimension. Our approach can also be
extended to infinite dimensional RKHSs at the cost of forgoing exactness. Both
for finite and infinite dimensional RKHSs, our method achieves better
experimental results than existing methods when memory resources limit the
feasible batch size and the possible number of inducing points.

Abstract: Over-squashing is a challenge in training graph neural networks for tasks
involving long-range dependencies. In such tasks, a GNN's receptive field
should be large enough to enable communication between distant nodes. However,
gathering information from a wide range of neighborhoods and squashing its
content into fixed-size node representations makes message-passing vulnerable
to bottlenecks. Graph rewiring and adding virtual nodes are commonly studied
remedies that create additional pathways around bottlenecks to mitigate
over-squashing. However, these techniques alter the input graph's global
topology and disrupt the domain knowledge encoded in the original graph
structure, both of which could be essential to specific tasks and domains. This
study presents Local Virtual Nodes (LVN) with trainable embeddings to alleviate
the effects of over-squashing without significantly corrupting the global
structure of the input graph. The position of the LVNs is determined by the
node centrality, which indicates the existence of potential bottlenecks. Thus,
the proposed approach aims to improve the connectivity in the regions with
likely bottlenecks. Furthermore, trainable LVN embeddings shared across
selected central regions facilitate communication between distant nodes without
adding more layers. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate
that LVNs can enhance structural connectivity and significantly improve
performance on graph and node classification tasks. The code can be found at

Conclusion: 基于任务的验证方法比传统分布距离估计更高效，特别适用于高维数据下的调查可信度评估，为下游研究有效性提供保障

Abstract: Assessing whether a sample survey credibly represents the population is a
critical question for ensuring the validity of downstream research. Generally,
this problem reduces to estimating the distance between two high-dimensional
distributions, which typically requires a number of samples that grows
exponentially with the dimension. However, depending on the model used for data
analysis, the conclusions drawn from the data may remain consistent across
different underlying distributions. In this context, we propose a task-based
approach to assess the credibility of sampled surveys. Specifically, we
introduce a model-specific distance metric to quantify this notion of
credibility. We also design an algorithm to verify the credibility of survey
data in the context of regression models. Notably, the sample complexity of our
algorithm is independent of the data dimension. This efficiency stems from the
fact that the algorithm focuses on verifying the credibility of the survey data
rather than reconstructing the underlying regression model. Furthermore, we
show that if one attempts to verify credibility by reconstructing the
regression model, the sample complexity scales linearly with the dimensionality
of the data. We prove the theoretical correctness of our algorithm and
numerically demonstrate our algorithm's performance.

invertible matrices with joint learning of a prediction model through
backpropagation. We illustrate the proposed algorithm on synthetic and real

observe an increased success rate of the non-convex optimization and the

Abstract: We investigated the adaptation and performance of Masked Autoencoders (MAEs)
with Vision Transformer (ViT) architectures for self-supervised representation
learning on one-dimensional (1D) ultrasound signals. Although MAEs have
demonstrated significant success in computer vision and other domains, their
use for 1D signal analysis, especially for raw ultrasound data, remains largely
unexplored. Ultrasound signals are vital in industrial applications such as
non-destructive testing (NDT) and structural health monitoring (SHM), where
labeled data are often scarce and signal processing is highly task-specific. We
propose an approach that leverages MAE to pre-train on unlabeled synthetic
ultrasound signals, enabling the model to learn robust representations that
enhance performance in downstream tasks, such as time-of-flight (ToF)
classification. This study systematically investigated the impact of model
size, patch size, and masking ratio on pre-training efficiency and downstream
accuracy. Our results show that pre-trained models significantly outperform
models trained from scratch and strong convolutional neural network (CNN)
baselines optimized for the downstream task. Additionally, pre-training on
synthetic data demonstrates superior transferability to real-world measured
signals compared with training solely on limited real datasets. This study
underscores the potential of MAEs for advancing ultrasound signal analysis
through scalable, self-supervised learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在处理多模态信息和工具调用方面表现出色，但在处理大规模图结构数据时仍存在困难，需要专门的图算法工具来增强其图数据推理能力。

Method: 开发GDS代理，提供一套完整的图算法工具集，包括预处理（检索）和算法结果后处理，通过模型上下文协议（MCP）服务器实现，可与任何现代LLM即插即用。

Conclusion: GDS代理成功扩展了LLM的图数据处理能力，但仍面临一些挑战，需要进一步的技术发展和路线图规划。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable multimodal information
processing and reasoning ability. When equipped with tools through function
calling and enhanced with retrieval-augmented techniques, compound LLM-based
systems can access closed data sources and answer questions about them.
However, they still struggle to process and reason over large-scale
graph-structure data. We introduce the GDS (Graph Data Science) agent in this
technical report. The GDS agent introduces a comprehensive set of graph
algorithms as tools, together with preprocessing (retrieval) and postprocessing
of algorithm results, in a model context protocol (MCP) server. The server can
be used with any modern LLM out-of-the-box. GDS agent allows users to ask any
question that implicitly and intrinsically requires graph algorithmic reasoning
about their data, and quickly obtain accurate and grounded answers. We also
introduce a new benchmark that evaluates intermediate tool calls as well as
final responses. The results indicate that GDS agent is able to solve a wide
spectrum of graph tasks. We also provide detailed case studies for more
open-ended tasks and study scenarios where the agent struggles. Finally, we
discuss the remaining challenges and the future roadmap.

TL;DR: 提出TV-HSGT算法，一种基于混合随机梯度追踪和方差缩减机制的时间变化混合随机梯度追踪算法，用于解决时变有向网络中的分布式在线优化问题，无需梯度有界假设。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着数据规模和动态性的增加，分布式在线优化对实时决策至关重要。现有算法往往依赖梯度有界假设且忽视随机梯度的影响，特别是在时变有向网络中。

Method: TV-HSGT算法结合行随机和列随机通信方案，无需Perron向量估计或出度信息。通过结合当前和递归随机梯度，有效减少梯度方差并准确追踪全局下降方向。

Result: 理论分析表明TV-HSGT能在不假设梯度有界的情况下实现改进的动态遗憾边界。逻辑回归任务的实验结果证实了其在动态和资源受限环境中的有效性。

Conclusion: TV-HSGT算法为时变有向网络中的分布式在线优化提供了一种有效的解决方案，突破了传统算法的限制，在理论和实验上都表现出优越性能。

Abstract: With the increasing scale and dynamics of data, distributed online
optimization has become essential for real-time decision-making in various
applications. However, existing algorithms often rely on bounded gradient
assumptions and overlook the impact of stochastic gradients, especially in
time-varying directed networks. This study proposes a novel Time-Varying Hybrid
Stochastic Gradient Tracking algorithm named TV-HSGT, based on hybrid
stochastic gradient tracking and variance reduction mechanisms. Specifically,
TV-HSGT integrates row-stochastic and column-stochastic communication schemes
over time-varying digraphs, eliminating the need for Perron vector estimation
or out-degree information. By combining current and recursive stochastic
gradients, it effectively reduces gradient variance while accurately tracking
global descent directions. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that TV-HSGT can
achieve improved bounds on dynamic regret without assuming gradient
boundedness. Experimental results on logistic regression tasks confirm the
effectiveness of TV-HSGT in dynamic and resource-constrained environments.

Conclusion: VarDiU通过无偏梯度估计显著提升扩散蒸馏性能，为一步生成模型提供了更优的训练方案。

Abstract: Recently, diffusion distillation methods have compressed thousand-step
teacher diffusion models into one-step student generators while preserving
sample quality. Most existing approaches train the student model using a
diffusive divergence whose gradient is approximated via the student's score
function, learned through denoising score matching (DSM). Since DSM training is
imperfect, the resulting gradient estimate is inevitably biased, leading to
sub-optimal performance. In this paper, we propose VarDiU (pronounced
/va:rdju:/), a Variational Diffusive Upper Bound that admits an unbiased
gradient estimator and can be directly applied to diffusion distillation. Using
this objective, we compare our method with Diff-Instruct and demonstrate that
it achieves higher generation quality and enables a more efficient and stable
training procedure for one-step diffusion distillation.

Abstract: In this work, we propose a novel framework to enhance the efficiency and
accuracy of neural operators through self-composition, offering both
theoretical guarantees and practical benefits. Inspired by iterative methods in
solving numerical partial differential equations (PDEs), we design a specific
neural operator by repeatedly applying a single neural operator block, we
progressively deepen the model without explicitly adding new blocks, improving
the model's capacity. To train these models efficiently, we introduce an
adaptive train-and-unroll approach, where the depth of the neural operator is
gradually increased during training. This approach reveals an accuracy scaling
law with model depth and offers significant computational savings through our
adaptive training strategy. Our architecture achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA)
performance on standard benchmarks. We further demonstrate its efficacy on a
challenging high-frequency ultrasound computed tomography (USCT) problem, where
a multigrid-inspired backbone enables superior performance in resolving complex
wave phenomena. The proposed framework provides a computationally tractable,
accurate, and scalable solution for large-scale data-driven scientific machine

Result: 实验结果显示，使用组合性合成数据训练的模型在测试集上的表现与使用原始临床数据训练相当，而在合成测试数据上的评估结果也与原始测试数据相似，超过了随机数据增帽方法。在SOFA分数预测任务中，使用组合性合成数据训练的模型表现显著超过了使用原始数据训练的模型。

Conclusion: 组合性时间序列生成方法能够有效地创建高质量的合成临床数据，不仅可以解决数据稀缩问题，还能提升下游预测任务的性能，为临床时间序列分析提供了新的解释框架。

Abstract: This work investigates whether time series of natural phenomena can be
understood as being generated by sequences of latent states which are ordered
in systematic and regular ways. We focus on clinical time series and ask
whether clinical measurements can be interpreted as being generated by
meaningful physiological states whose succession follows systematic principles.
Uncovering the underlying compositional structure will allow us to create
synthetic data to alleviate the notorious problem of sparse and low-resource
data settings in clinical time series forecasting, and deepen our understanding
of clinical data. We start by conceptualizing compositionality for time series
as a property of the data generation process, and then study data-driven
procedures that can reconstruct the elementary states and composition rules of
this process. We evaluate the success of this methods using two empirical tests
originating from a domain adaptation perspective. Both tests infer the
similarity of the original time series distribution and the synthetic time
series distribution from the similarity of expected risk of time series
forecasting models trained and tested on original and synthesized data in
specific ways. Our experimental results show that the test set performance
achieved by training on compositionally synthesized data is comparable to
training on original clinical time series data, and that evaluation of models
on compositionally synthesized test data shows similar results to evaluating on
original test data, outperforming randomization-based data augmentation. An
additional downstream evaluation of the prediction task of sequential organ
failure assessment (SOFA) scores shows significant performance gains when model
training is entirely based on compositionally synthesized data compared to
training on original data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型能力增强，RL微调比SFT微调带来更大的有害使用风险，需要专门防御RL基有害微调的方法。

Method: 提出TokenBuncher防御框架，使用熵作为奖励的RL方法和Token Noiser机制来约束模型响应不确定性，防止RL利用奖励信号驱动有害行为。

Result: 在多个模型和RL算法上的实验表明，TokenBuncher能有效缓解有害RL微调，同时保持良性任务效用和微调能力。

Conclusion: RL基有害微调比SFT构成更大系统风险，TokenBuncher提供了有效且通用的防御解决方案。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) continue to grow in capability, so do the
risks of harmful misuse through fine-tuning. While most prior studies assume
that attackers rely on supervised fine-tuning (SFT) for such misuse, we
systematically demonstrate that reinforcement learning (RL) enables adversaries
to more effectively break safety alignment and facilitate advanced harmful task
assistance, under matched computational budgets. To counter this emerging
threat, we propose TokenBuncher, the first effective defense specifically
targeting RL-based harmful fine-tuning. TokenBuncher suppresses the foundation
on which RL relies: model response uncertainty. By constraining uncertainty,
RL-based fine-tuning can no longer exploit distinct reward signals to drive the
model toward harmful behaviors. We realize this defense through
entropy-as-reward RL and a Token Noiser mechanism designed to prevent the
escalation of expert-domain harmful capabilities. Extensive experiments across
multiple models and RL algorithms show that TokenBuncher robustly mitigates
harmful RL fine-tuning while preserving benign task utility and finetunability.
Our results highlight that RL-based harmful fine-tuning poses a greater
systemic risk than SFT, and that TokenBuncher provides an effective and general
defense.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有EEG表示学习方法（如EEGPT和LaBraM）依赖简单的掩码重建目标，可能无法充分捕捉EEG信号中丰富的语义信息和复杂模式，特别是在训练数据有限时泛化能力不足。

Method: 提出EEGDM方法，包含EEG编码器将EEG信号及其通道增强压缩为紧凑表示，作为条件信息指导扩散模型生成EEG信号，形成紧凑的潜在空间。

Conclusion: EEGDM通过扩散模型实现了强大的EEG表示学习能力，具有良好的泛化性和实用价值。

Abstract: While electroencephalography (EEG) signal analysis using deep learning has
shown great promise, existing approaches still face significant challenges in
learning generalizable representations that perform well across diverse tasks,
particularly when training data is limited. Current EEG representation learning
methods including EEGPT and LaBraM typically rely on simple masked
reconstruction objective, which may not fully capture the rich semantic
information and complex patterns inherent in EEG signals. In this paper, we
propose EEGDM, a novel self-supervised EEG representation learning method based
on the latent diffusion model, which leverages EEG signal generation as a
self-supervised objective, turning the diffusion model into a strong
representation learner capable of capturing EEG semantics. EEGDM incorporates
an EEG encoder that distills EEG signals and their channel augmentations into a
compact representation, acting as conditional information to guide the
diffusion model for generating EEG signals. This design endows EEGDM with a
compact latent space, which not only offers ample control over the generative
process but also can be leveraged for downstream tasks. Experimental results
show that EEGDM (1) can reconstruct high-quality EEG signals, (2) effectively
learns robust representations, and (3) achieves competitive performance with
modest pre-training data size across diverse downstream tasks, underscoring its
generalizability and practical utility.

Conclusion: 工具增强工作流不仅实用，而且理论上更具可扩展性，为工具增强语言模型提供了理论和实证基础，表明外部检索比内部记忆在事实召回方面具有根本优势。

Abstract: Tool-augmented language models, equipped with retrieval, memory, or external
APIs, are reshaping AI, yet their theoretical advantages remain underexplored.
In this paper, we address this question by demonstrating the benefits of
in-tool learning (external retrieval) over in-weight learning (memorization)
for factual recall. We show that the number of facts a model can memorize
solely in its weights is fundamentally limited by its parameter count. In
contrast, we prove that tool-use enables unbounded factual recall via a simple
and efficient circuit construction. These results are validated in controlled
experiments, where tool-using models consistently outperform memorizing ones.
We further show that for pretrained large language models, teaching tool-use
and general rules is more effective than finetuning facts into memory. Our work
provides both a theoretical and empirical foundation, establishing why
tool-augmented workflows are not just practical, but provably more scalable.

Abstract: We introduce SAFEMax, a novel method for Machine Unlearning in diffusion

by selectively focusing on the early diffusion steps, where class-specific

Conclusion: cMALC-D框架通过LLM引导的课程学习和多样性上下文混合，有效解决了多智能体强化学习在复杂不确定环境中的泛化问题，为实际部署提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Many multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithms are trained in
fixed simulation environments, making them brittle when deployed in real-world
scenarios with more complex and uncertain conditions. Contextual MARL (cMARL)
addresses this by parameterizing environments with context variables and
training a context-agnostic policy that performs well across all environment
configurations. Existing cMARL methods attempt to use curriculum learning to
help train and evaluate context-agnostic policies, but they often rely on
unreliable proxy signals, such as value estimates or generalized advantage
estimates that are noisy and unstable in multi-agent settings due to
inter-agent dynamics and partial observability. To address these issues, we
propose Contextual Multi-Agent LLM-Guided Curriculum Learning with
Diversity-Based Context Blending (cMALC-D), a framework that uses Large
Language Models (LLMs) to generate semantically meaningful curricula and
provide a more robust evaluation signal. To prevent mode collapse and encourage
exploration, we introduce a novel diversity-based context blending mechanism
that creates new training scenarios by combining features from prior contexts.
Experiments in traffic signal control domains demonstrate that cMALC-D
significantly improves both generalization and sample efficiency compared to
existing curriculum learning baselines. We provide code at

Abstract: Feature transformation plays a critical role in enhancing machine learning
model performance by optimizing data representations. Recent state-of-the-art
approaches address this task as a continuous embedding optimization problem,
converting discrete search into a learnable process. Although effective, these
methods often rely on sequential encoder-decoder structures that cause high
computational costs and parameter requirements, limiting scalability and
efficiency. To address these limitations, we propose a novel framework that
accomplishes automated feature transformation through four steps:
transformation records collection, embedding space construction with a revised
Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) model, gradient-ascent search, and
autoregressive reconstruction. In our approach, the revised GPT model serves
two primary functions: (a) feature transformation sequence reconstruction and
(b) model performance estimation and enhancement for downstream tasks by
constructing the embedding space. Such a multi-objective optimization framework
reduces parameter size and accelerates transformation processes. Experimental
results on benchmark datasets show that the proposed framework matches or
exceeds baseline performance, with significant gains in computational
efficiency. This work highlights the potential of transformer-based
architectures for scalable, high-performance automated feature transformation.

Abstract: Financial fraud detection is essential to safeguard billions of dollars, yet
the intertwined entities and fast-changing transaction behaviors in modern
financial systems routinely defeat conventional machine learning models. Recent
graph-based detectors make headway by representing transactions as networks,
but they still overlook two fraud hallmarks rooted in time: (1) temporal
motifs--recurring, telltale subgraphs that reveal suspicious money flows as
they unfold--and (2) account-specific intervals of anomalous activity, when
fraud surfaces only in short bursts unique to each entity. To exploit both
signals, we introduce ATM-GAD, an adaptive graph neural network that leverages
temporal motifs for financial anomaly detection. A Temporal Motif Extractor
condenses each account's transaction history into the most informative motifs,
preserving both topology and temporal patterns. These motifs are then analyzed
by dual-attention blocks: IntraA reasons over interactions within a single
motif, while InterA aggregates evidence across motifs to expose multi-step
fraud schemes. In parallel, a differentiable Adaptive Time-Window Learner
tailors the observation window for every node, allowing the model to focus
precisely on the most revealing time slices. Experiments on four real-world
datasets show that ATM-GAD consistently outperforms seven strong
anomaly-detection baselines, uncovering fraud patterns missed by earlier
methods.

Abstract: The Internet of Things (IoT) is ubiquitous thanks to the rapid development of
wireless technologies. However, the broadcast nature of wireless transmissions
results in great vulnerability to device authentication. Physical layer
authentication emerges as a promising approach by exploiting the unique channel
characteristics. However, a practical scheme applicable to dynamic channel
variations is still missing. In this paper, we proposed a deep learning-based
physical layer channel state information (CSI) authentication for mobile
scenarios and carried out comprehensive simulation and experimental evaluation
using IEEE 802.11n. Specifically, a synthetic training dataset was generated
based on the WLAN TGn channel model and the autocorrelation and the distance
correlation of the channel, which can significantly reduce the overhead of
manually collecting experimental datasets. A convolutional neural network
(CNN)-based Siamese network was exploited to learn the temporal and spatial
correlation between the CSI pair and output a score to measure their
similarity. We adopted a synergistic methodology involving both simulation and
experimental evaluation. The experimental testbed consisted of WiFi IoT
development kits and a few typical scenarios were specifically considered. Both
simulation and experimental evaluation demonstrated excellent generalization
performance of our proposed deep learning-based approach and excellent
authentication performance. Demonstrated by our practical measurement results,
our proposed scheme improved the area under the curve (AUC) by 0.03 compared to
the fully connected network-based (FCN-based) Siamese model and by 0.06
compared to the correlation-based benchmark algorithm.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量子力学轨迹数据集昂贵且难以整合，格式、元数据和可访问性存在差异，限制了准确机器学习原子间势能的发展。

Method: 从Materials Project、Alexandria和OQMD等大型存储库中聚合数据，标准化数据表示，协调结果并过滤高质量构型，涵盖PBE、PBESol、SCAN、r2SCAN等DFT泛函。

Result: 通过在高力数据预训练模型上使用LeMat-Traj进行微调，在弛豫任务上显著降低了力预测误差。

Conclusion: LeMat-Traj显著降低了训练可迁移和准确机器学习原子间势能的障碍，并提供了LeMaterial-Fetcher开源库来确保数据集持续发展。

Abstract: The development of accurate machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs)
is limited by the fragmented availability and inconsistent formatting of
quantum mechanical trajectory datasets derived from Density Functional Theory
(DFT). These datasets are expensive to generate yet difficult to combine due to
variations in format, metadata, and accessibility. To address this, we
introduce LeMat-Traj, a curated dataset comprising over 120 million atomic
configurations aggregated from large-scale repositories, including the
Materials Project, Alexandria, and OQMD. LeMat-Traj standardizes data
representation, harmonizes results and filters for high-quality configurations
across widely used DFT functionals (PBE, PBESol, SCAN, r2SCAN). It
significantly lowers the barrier for training transferrable and accurate MLIPs.
LeMat-Traj spans both relaxed low-energy states and high-energy, high-force
structures, complementing molecular dynamics and active learning datasets. By
fine-tuning models pre-trained on high-force data with LeMat-Traj, we achieve a
significant reduction in force prediction errors on relaxation tasks. We also
present LeMaterial-Fetcher, a modular and extensible open-source library
developed for this work, designed to provide a reproducible framework for the
community to easily incorporate new data sources and ensure the continued
evolution of large-scale materials datasets. LeMat-Traj and LeMaterial-Fetcher

Abstract: While foundation models have revolutionized such fields as natural language
processing and computer vision, their application and potential within graph
machine learning remain largely unexplored. One of the key challenges in
designing graph foundation models (GFMs) is handling diverse node features that
can vary across different graph datasets. Although many works on GFMs have been
focused exclusively on text-attributed graphs, the problem of handling
arbitrary features of other types in GFMs has not been fully addressed.
However, this problem is not unique to the graph domain, as it also arises in
the field of machine learning for tabular data. In this work, motivated by the
recent success of tabular foundation models like TabPFNv2, we propose G2T-FM, a
simple graph foundation model that employs TabPFNv2 as a backbone.
Specifically, G2T-FM augments the original node features with neighborhood
feature aggregation, adds structural embeddings, and then applies TabPFNv2 to
the constructed node representations. Even in a fully in-context regime, our
model achieves strong results, significantly outperforming publicly available
GFMs and performing on par with well-tuned GNNs trained from scratch. Moreover,
after finetuning, G2T-FM surpasses well-tuned GNN baselines, highlighting the
potential of the proposed approach. More broadly, our paper reveals a
previously overlooked direction of utilizing tabular foundation models for
graph machine learning tasks.

Conclusion: 该工作将自适应学习的理论进展与人口层面行为改变干预的实际挑战相结合，验证了框架在现实应用中的潜力

Abstract: We study a sequential resource allocation problem where a decision maker
selects subsets of agents at each period to maximize overall outcomes without
prior knowledge of individual-level effects. Our framework applies to settings
such as community health interventions, targeted digital advertising, and
workforce retention programs, where intervention effects evolve dynamically.
Agents may exhibit habituation (diminished response from frequent selection) or
recovery (enhanced response from infrequent selection). The technical challenge
centers on nonstationary reward distributions that lead to changing
intervention effects over time. The problem requires balancing two key
competing objectives: heterogeneous individual rewards and the
exploration-exploitation tradeoff in terms of learning for improved future
decisions as opposed to maximizing immediate outcomes. Our contribution
introduces the first framework incorporating this form of nonstationary rewards
in the combinatorial multi-armed bandit literature. We develop algorithms with
theoretical guarantees on dynamic regret and demonstrate practical efficacy
through a diabetes intervention case study. Our personalized community
intervention algorithm achieved up to three times as much improvement in
program enrollment compared to baseline approaches, validating the framework's
potential for real-world applications. This work bridges theoretical advances
in adaptive learning with practical challenges in population-level behavioral
change interventions.

TL;DR: DiTree是一个结合扩散策略和采样规划器的运动规划框架，在保证安全性的同时显著提升规划效率和泛化能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统采样规划器探索效率低，而学习型方法缺乏安全保证和泛化能力的问题

Method: 将扩散策略作为信息采样器集成到RRT等采样规划器中，利用扩散策略建模专家轨迹分布来指导状态空间搜索

Result: 在分布外场景中，DiTree比传统采样规划器快3倍，成功率提高约30%，与单独扩散策略相比运行时间相当但成功率更高

Conclusion: DiTree成功结合了学习方法的效率和传统方法的可证明安全性，为复杂动力学系统的运动规划提供了既高效又安全的解决方案

Abstract: Kinodynamic motion planning is concerned with computing collision-free
trajectories while abiding by the robot's dynamic constraints. This critical
problem is often tackled using sampling-based planners (SBPs) that explore the
robot's high-dimensional state space by constructing a search tree via action
propagations. Although SBPs can offer global guarantees on completeness and
solution quality, their performance is often hindered by slow exploration due
to uninformed action sampling. Learning-based approaches can yield
significantly faster runtimes, yet they fail to generalize to
out-of-distribution (OOD) scenarios and lack critical guarantees, e.g., safety,
thus limiting their deployment on physical robots. We present Diffusion Tree
(DiTree): a \emph{provably-generalizable} framework leveraging diffusion
policies (DPs) as informed samplers to efficiently guide state-space search
within SBPs. DiTree combines DP's ability to model complex distributions of
expert trajectories, conditioned on local observations, with the completeness
of SBPs to yield \emph{provably-safe} solutions within a few action propagation
iterations for complex dynamical systems. We demonstrate DiTree's power with an
implementation combining the popular RRT planner with a DP action sampler
trained on a \emph{single environment}. In comprehensive evaluations on OOD
scenarios, % DiTree has comparable runtimes to a standalone DP (3x faster than
classical SBPs), while improving the average success rate over DP and SBPs.
DiTree is on average 3x faster than classical SBPs, and outperforms all other
approaches by achieving roughly 30\% higher success rate. Project webpage:

Motivation: 解决现有检索模型只关注查询相关性而忽视多样性的问题，这对于上下文学习(ICL)至关重要

Method: 1) 将ICL建模为目标选择问题，基于SMI的统一选择策略挖掘相关且多样的上下文示例；2) 引入组合训练范式，通过新颖的基于似然的损失函数学习SMI参数；3) 使用合成生成的释义增强多跳问答数据集

Result: 在9个基准数据集上采用该检索模型和新颖的目标选择公式进行ICL，显示出显著改进

Conclusion: InSQuAD方法通过同时确保质量和多样性，有效提升了上下文学习的性能，验证了该方法的有效性

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce InSQuAD, designed to enhance the performance of
In-Context Learning (ICL) models through Submodular Mutual Information} (SMI)
enforcing Quality and Diversity among in-context exemplars. InSQuAD achieves
this through two principal strategies: First, we model the ICL task as a
targeted selection problem and introduce a unified selection strategy based on
SMIs which mines relevant yet diverse in-context examples encapsulating the
notions of quality and diversity. Secondly, we address a common pitfall in
existing retrieval models which model query relevance, often overlooking
diversity, critical for ICL. InSQuAD introduces a combinatorial training
paradigm which learns the parameters of an SMI function to enforce both quality
and diversity in the retrieval model through a novel likelihood-based loss. To
further aid the learning process we augment an existing multi-hop question
answering dataset with synthetically generated paraphrases. Adopting the
retrieval model trained using this strategy alongside the novel targeted
selection formulation for ICL on nine benchmark datasets shows significant
improvements validating the efficacy of our approach.

Conclusion: RLG为扩散模型对齐提供了实用且理论可靠的方法，在推理时实现了前所未有的对齐控制灵活性。

Abstract: Denoising-based generative models, particularly diffusion and flow matching
algorithms, have achieved remarkable success. However, aligning their output
distributions with complex downstream objectives, such as human preferences,
compositional accuracy, or data compressibility, remains challenging. While
reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning methods, inspired by advances in RL
from human feedback (RLHF) for large language models, have been adapted to
these generative frameworks, current RL approaches are suboptimal for diffusion
models and offer limited flexibility in controlling alignment strength after
fine-tuning. In this work, we reinterpret RL fine-tuning for diffusion models
through the lens of stochastic differential equations and implicit reward
conditioning. We introduce Reinforcement Learning Guidance (RLG), an
inference-time method that adapts Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG) by combining
the outputs of the base and RL fine-tuned models via a geometric average. Our
theoretical analysis shows that RLG's guidance scale is mathematically
equivalent to adjusting the KL-regularization coefficient in standard RL
objectives, enabling dynamic control over the alignment-quality trade-off
without further training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RLG
consistently improves the performance of RL fine-tuned models across various
architectures, RL algorithms, and downstream tasks, including human
preferences, compositional control, compressibility, and text rendering.
Furthermore, RLG supports both interpolation and extrapolation, thereby
offering unprecedented flexibility in controlling generative alignment. Our
approach provides a practical and theoretically sound solution for enhancing
and controlling diffusion model alignment at inference. The source code for RLG
is publicly available at the Github:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SNGD在科学机器学习中表现出色但缺乏理论解释，需要填补这一理论空白，理解子采样与曲率感知优化策略之间的相互作用。

Method: 通过分析线性模型和强凸二次损失函数的理想化参数优化问题，将SNGD和SPRING与正则化Kaczmarz方法建立等价关系，并利用现有分析工具推导收敛性。

Result: 获得了SNGD的快速收敛速率、SPRING的首个收敛保证，并证明了SPRING能够加速SNGD。在一般强凸二次损失情况下，在更强条件下也获得了SNGD的快速收敛速率。

Conclusion: 随机线性代数工具能够揭示子采样与曲率感知优化策略之间的关系，为SNGD在最小二乘之外的有效性提供了首个理论解释。

Abstract: Subsampled natural gradient descent (SNGD) has shown impressive results for
parametric optimization tasks in scientific machine learning, such as neural
network wavefunctions and physics-informed neural networks, but it has lacked a
theoretical explanation. We address this gap by analyzing the convergence of
SNGD and its accelerated variant, SPRING, for idealized parametric optimization
problems where the model is linear and the loss function is strongly convex and
quadratic. In the special case of a least-squares loss, namely the standard
linear least-squares problem, we prove that SNGD is equivalent to a regularized
Kaczmarz method while SPRING is equivalent to an accelerated regularized
Kaczmarz method. As a result, by leveraging existing analyses we obtain under
mild conditions (i) the first fast convergence rate for SNGD, (ii) the first
convergence guarantee for SPRING in any setting, and (iii) the first proof that
SPRING can accelerate SNGD. In the case of a general strongly convex quadratic
loss, we extend the analysis of the regularized Kaczmarz method to obtain a
fast convergence rate for SNGD under stronger conditions, providing the first
explanation for the effectiveness of SNGD outside of the least-squares setting.
Overall, our results illustrate how tools from randomized linear algebra can
shed new light on the interplay between subsampling and curvature-aware
optimization strategies.

Conclusion: LoTUS提供了一种实用且高效的机器遗忘解决方案，适用于现实世界的大规模应用场景，并引入了新的评估指标RF-JSD来支持实际条件下的评估。

Abstract: We present LoTUS, a novel Machine Unlearning (MU) method that eliminates the
influence of training samples from pre-trained models, avoiding retraining from
scratch. LoTUS smooths the prediction probabilities of the model up to an
information-theoretic bound, mitigating its over-confidence stemming from data
memorization. We evaluate LoTUS on Transformer and ResNet18 models against
eight baselines across five public datasets. Beyond established MU benchmarks,
we evaluate unlearning on ImageNet1k, a large-scale dataset, where retraining
is impractical, simulating real-world conditions. Moreover, we introduce the
novel Retrain-Free Jensen-Shannon Divergence (RF-JSD) metric to enable
evaluation under real-world conditions. The experimental results show that
LoTUS outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of both efficiency and
effectiveness. Code: https://github.com/cspartalis/LoTUS.

Motivation: 现有的情感推荐系统调查缺乏基于心理学的分类体系，且往往只关注特定类型的情感状态或应用领域，需要更全面的综述来指导该领域发展。

Method: 基于Scherer的情感状态类型学，提出了四类分类框架（态度感知、情绪感知、心境感知和混合型），系统分析了情感信号提取技术、系统架构和应用领域。

Abstract: Affective Recommender Systems are an emerging class of intelligent systems
that aim to enhance personalization by aligning recommendations with users'
affective states. Reflecting a growing interest, a number of surveys have been
published in this area, however they lack an organizing taxonomy grounded in
psychology and they often study only specific types of affective states or
application domains. This survey addresses these limitations by providing a
comprehensive, systematic review of affective recommender systems across
diverse domains. Drawing from Scherer's typology of affective states, we
introduce a classification scheme that organizes systems into four main
categories: attitude aware, emotion aware, mood aware, and hybrid. We further
document affective signal extraction techniques, system architectures, and
application areas, highlighting key trends, limitations, and open challenges.
As future research directions, we emphasize hybrid models that leverage
multiple types of affective states across different modalities, the development
of large-scale affect-aware datasets, and the need to replace the folk
vocabulary of affective states with a more precise terminology grounded in
cognitive and social psychology. Through its systematic review of existing
research and challenges, this survey aims to serve as a comprehensive reference
and a useful guide for advancing academic research and industry applications in
affect-driven personalization.

Conclusion: ELIXIR证明了基于方面的架构在个性化文本生成指导方面的有效性，为推荐系统提供了高效且轻量级的解释生成解决方案。

Abstract: Collaborative filtering drives many successful recommender systems but
struggles with fine-grained user-item interactions and explainability. As users
increasingly seek transparent recommendations, generating textual explanations
through language models has become a critical research area. Existing methods
employ either RNNs or Transformers. However, RNN-based approaches fail to
leverage the capabilities of pre-trained Transformer models, whereas
Transformer-based methods often suffer from suboptimal adaptation and neglect
aspect modeling, which is crucial for personalized explanations. We propose
ELIXIR (Efficient and LIghtweight model for eXplaIning Recommendations), a
multi-task model combining rating prediction with personalized review
generation. ELIXIR jointly learns global and aspect-specific representations of
users and items, optimizing overall rating, aspect-level ratings, and review
generation, with personalized attention to emphasize aspect importance. Based
on a T5-small (60M) model, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our aspect-based
architecture in guiding text generation in a personalized context, where
state-of-the-art approaches exploit much larger models but fail to match user
preferences as well. Experimental results on TripAdvisor and RateBeer
demonstrate that ELIXIR significantly outperforms strong baseline models,
especially in review generation.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的多模态音乐推荐框架，通过渐进式语义残差量化和多码本交叉注意力网络解决现有方法中的模态内语义退化和模态间建模差距问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有音乐推荐系统中，基于语义ID的多模态内容特征融合方法存在两个关键问题：1）模态内语义退化，残差量化过程导致离散ID与原始内容语义逐渐解耦；2）模态间建模差距，传统融合策略要么忽略模态特定细节，要么无法捕捉跨模态相关性。

Method: 两阶段框架：第一阶段使用渐进式语义残差量化（PSRQ）生成模态特定和模态联合语义ID，显式保留前缀语义特征；第二阶段设计多码本交叉注意力（MCCA）网络，同时捕捉模态特定兴趣和跨模态相关性。

Conclusion: 该框架在工业级推荐系统中具有实用价值，成功解决了多模态兴趣学习中的关键挑战，为音乐推荐系统提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: In music recommendation systems, multimodal interest learning is pivotal,
which allows the model to capture nuanced preferences, including textual
elements such as lyrics and various musical attributes such as different
instruments and melodies. Recently, methods that incorporate multimodal content
features through semantic IDs have achieved promising results. However,
existing methods suffer from two critical limitations: 1) intra-modal semantic
degradation, where residual-based quantization processes gradually decouple
discrete IDs from original content semantics, leading to semantic drift; and 2)
inter-modal modeling gaps, where traditional fusion strategies either overlook
modal-specific details or fail to capture cross-modal correlations, hindering
comprehensive user interest modeling. To address these challenges, we propose a
novel multimodal recommendation framework with two stages. In the first stage,
our Progressive Semantic Residual Quantization (PSRQ) method generates
modal-specific and modal-joint semantic IDs by explicitly preserving the prefix
semantic feature. In the second stage, to model multimodal interest of users, a
Multi-Codebook Cross-Attention (MCCA) network is designed to enable the model
to simultaneously capture modal-specific interests and perceive cross-modal
correlations. Extensive experiments on multiple real-world datasets demonstrate
that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. This framework has
been deployed on one of China's largest music streaming platforms, and online
A/B tests confirm significant improvements in commercial metrics, underscoring
its practical value for industrial-scale recommendation systems.

Abstract: Modern IR systems are an extremely important tool for seeking information. In
addition to search, such systems include a number of query reformulation
methods, such as query expansion and query recommendations, to provide high

undesirable or wrongful bias with respect to protected categories such as
gender or race. Our earlier work considered the problem of balanced query
recommendation, where instead of re-ranking a list of results based on fairness
measures, the goal was to suggest queries that are relevant to a user's search
query but exhibit less bias than the original query. In this work, we present a
case study of BalancedQR using an extension of BalancedQR that handles biases
in multiple dimensions. It employs a Pareto front approach that finds balanced
queries, optimizing for multiple objectives such as gender bias and regional
bias, along with the relevance of returned results. We evaluate the extended
version of BalancedQR on a Wikipedia dataset.Our results demonstrate the
effectiveness of our extension to BalancedQR framework and highlight the
significant impact of subtle query wording,linguistic choice on retrieval.

*Yijia Sun,Shanshan Huang,Linxiao Che,Haitao Lu,Qiang Luo,Kun Gai,Guorui Zhou*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: MPFormer是一个动态多任务Transformer框架，通过目标条件化Transformer、个性化目标权重和用户个性化信息集成，解决了工业推荐系统中多阶段优化不对齐的问题，显著提升了快手短视频推荐系统的用户参与度和运营效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业推荐系统面临多阶段优化不对齐的核心挑战：排序阶段广泛使用的多目标优化范式与召回阶段的单目标建模之间存在显著的语义鸿沟。主流解决方案通过并行多路径单目标召回实现多目标覆盖，但这种方法导致训练和服务资源随目标数量线性增长，且在处理松散耦合目标时存在固有局限性。

Method: 提出MPFormer动态多任务Transformer框架，包含三个创新机制：1）目标条件化Transformer，通过可学习注意力调制联合编码用户行为序列和多任务语义；2）引入个性化目标权重实现检索结果的动态调整；3）将用户个性化信息集成到token表示和Transformer结构中，进一步增强模型表示能力。

Result: 该框架已成功集成到快手短视频推荐系统中，稳定服务超过4亿日活跃用户。相比传统解决方案，在保持服务响应速度的同时，显著提升了用户日常参与度和系统运营效率，有效优化了多目标检索的迭代范式。

Conclusion: MPFormer为工业推荐系统提供了一个可扩展的多目标解决方案，通过动态多任务Transformer框架系统性地解决了多阶段优化不对齐问题，在保持服务性能的同时实现了更好的多目标优化效果。

Abstract: Modern industrial recommendation systems encounter a core challenge of
multi-stage optimization misalignment: a significant semantic gap exists
between the multi-objective optimization paradigm widely used in the ranking
phase and the single-objective modeling in the retrieve phase. Although the
mainstream industry solution achieves multi-objective coverage through parallel
multi-path single-objective retrieval, this approach leads to linear growth of
training and serving resources with the number of objectives and has inherent
limitations in handling loosely coupled objectives. This paper proposes the
MPFormer, a dynamic multi-task Transformer framework, which systematically
addresses the aforementioned issues through three innovative mechanisms. First,
an objective-conditioned transformer that jointly encodes user behavior
sequences and multi-task semantics through learnable attention modulation;
second, personalized target weights are introduced to achieve dynamic
adjustment of retrieval results; finally, user personalization information is
incorporated into token representations and the Transformer structure to
further enhance the model's representation ability. This framework has been
successfully integrated into Kuaishou short video recommendation system, stably
serving over 400 million daily active users. It significantly improves user
daily engagement and system operational efficiency. Practical deployment
verification shows that, compared with traditional solutions, it effectively
optimizes the iterative paradigm of multi-objective retrieval while maintaining
service response speed, providing a scalable multi-objective solution for
industrial recommendation systems.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 提出了一个专门评估零上下文推荐公平性的基准测试，发现大型语言模型在冷启动推荐中存在性别和文化刻板印象等偏见，且模型大小与公平性存在非线性关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在冷启动推荐场景中可能依赖预训练时编码的社会偏见，引发公平性担忧，需要系统化的评估方法。

Method: 设计模块化基准测试管道，支持可配置的推荐领域和敏感属性，对Gemma 3和Llama 3.2等先进模型进行系统性评估。

Result: 发现模型在音乐、电影和大学推荐领域存在一致的性别和文化刻板印象偏见，并揭示模型大小与公平性之间的非线性关系。

Conclusion: 需要更细致的分析来理解模型大小对公平性的影响，强调在零上下文推荐场景中评估和缓解偏见的重要性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used for recommendation tasks
due to their general-purpose capabilities. While LLMs perform well in
rich-context settings, their behavior in cold-start scenarios, where only
limited signals such as age, gender, or language are available, raises fairness
concerns because they may rely on societal biases encoded during pretraining.
We introduce a benchmark specifically designed to evaluate fairness in
zero-context recommendation. Our modular pipeline supports configurable
recommendation domains and sensitive attributes, enabling systematic and
flexible audits of any open-source LLM. Through evaluations of state-of-the-art
models (Gemma 3 and Llama 3.2), we uncover consistent biases across
recommendation domains (music, movies, and colleges) including gendered and
cultural stereotypes. We also reveal a non-linear relationship between model
size and fairness, highlighting the need for nuanced analysis.

*Haoyu Wu,Qingcheng Zeng,Kaize Ding*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 研究发现基于LLM的密集检索器和重排序器相比其基础生成模型在事实准确性方面存在显著下降，绝对准确率下降12-43个百分点，主要依赖表面语义相似性而非事实推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 了解检索增强生成(RAG)管道中密集检索器和重排序器从基础大语言模型继承或丢失了多少事实能力，这对于维护系统可信度和防御RAG中毒至关重要。

Method: 将12个公开的嵌入检查点与其原始基础LLM配对，在事实性基准上进行评估，使用统计测试分析相似性分数，并通过GPT-4.1改写正确答案创建改写测试集来探究弱点。

Result: 所有嵌入变体的准确率都显著低于基础模型（中位数下降28个百分点），检索器准确率降至25-35%，而生成模型达到60-70%。在候选池扩大时准确率进一步下降，改写测试后准确率降至原来的三分之一。

Conclusion: 对比学习为检索器引入了系统性权衡：语义检索能力的提升是以参数化事实知识的损失为代价的，检索器主要依赖表面语义接近度而非事实推理进行决策。

Abstract: Dense retrievers and rerankers are central to retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG) pipelines, where accurately retrieving factual information is crucial for
maintaining system trustworthiness and defending against RAG poisoning.
However, little is known about how much factual competence these components
inherit or lose from the large language models (LLMs) they are based on. We
pair 12 publicly released embedding checkpoints with their original base LLMs
and evaluate both sets on a factuality benchmark. Across every model evaluated,
the embedding variants achieve markedly lower accuracy than their bases, with
absolute drops ranging from 12 to 43 percentage points (median 28 pts) and
typical retriever accuracies collapsing into the 25-35 % band versus the 60-70
% attained by the generative models. This degradation intensifies under a more
demanding condition: when the candidate pool per question is expanded from four
options to one thousand, the strongest retriever's top-1 accuracy falls from 33
% to 26 %, revealing acute sensitivity to distractor volume. Statistical tests
further show that, for every embedding model, cosine-similarity scores between
queries and correct completions are significantly higher than those for
incorrect ones (p < 0.01), indicating decisions driven largely by surface-level
semantic proximity rather than factual reasoning. To probe this weakness, we
employed GPT-4.1 to paraphrase each correct completion, creating a rewritten
test set that preserved factual truth while masking lexical cues, and observed
that over two-thirds of previously correct predictions flipped to wrong,
reducing overall accuracy to roughly one-third of its original level. Taken
together, these findings reveal a systematic trade-off introduced by
contrastive learning for retrievers: gains in semantic retrieval are paid for
with losses in parametric factual knowledge......

<details>

Motivation: 现有研究认为多行为推荐中高频信息是噪声而低频信息有价值，但本文认为高频信息对应兴趣多样性同样重要，需要平衡纯净度和多样性来提升推荐效果。

Method: 提出PDB4Rec模型，有效提取不同频段信息及其关系，并引入Boostrapping Balancer机制来平衡各频段贡献。

Result: 在真实数据集上的充分实验证明了模型的有效性和效率。

Conclusion: 高频信息对应兴趣多样性具有重要价值，通过频段信息平衡机制可以显著提升多行为序列推荐性能。

Abstract: In recommendation systems, users often exhibit multiple behaviors, such as
browsing, clicking, and purchasing. Multi-behavior sequential recommendation
(MBSR) aims to consider these different behaviors in an integrated manner to
improve the recommendation performance of the target behavior. However, some
behavior data will also bring inevitable noise to the modeling of user
interests. Some research efforts focus on data denoising from the frequency
domain perspective to improve the accuracy of user preference prediction. These
studies indicate that low-frequency information tends to be valuable and
reliable, while high-frequency information is often associated with noise. In
this paper, we argue that high-frequency information is by no means
insignificant. Further experimental results highlight that low frequency
corresponds to the purity of user interests, while high frequency corresponds
to the diversity of user interests. Building upon this finding, we proposed our
model PDB4Rec, which efficiently extracts information across various frequency
bands and their relationships, and introduces Boostrapping Balancer mechanism
to balance their contributions for improved recommendation performance.
Sufficient experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and
efficiency of our model.

*Peter Muellner,Anna Schreuer,Simone Kopeinik,Bernhard Wieser,Dominik Kowald*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 本文通过半系统性文献综述，综合旅游管理和计算机科学文献，指出算法推荐系统在旅游领域存在多利益相关方公平性问题，强调需要跨学科合作来真正理解和支持多维度公平性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 算法决策支持系统（如推荐系统）在旅游中常无意导致负面环境影响和社区问题，这源于计算机科学对现实世界复杂利益关系和权衡的有限理解。

Method: 采用半系统性文献综述方法，综合分析了旅游管理和计算机科学领域的相关文献，对比了两个学科在研究方法和视角上的差异。

Result: 研究发现旅游管理采用定性、包容和参与式方法从规范性整体视角研究公平性，而计算机科学主要依赖少数数学化的公平标准，缺乏对利益相关方需求的理解。

Conclusion: 纯算法研究存在明显不足，未来需要通过跨学科合作来增强算法决策支持系统，以真正理解和支持旅游中的多利益相关方公平性。

Abstract: Algorithmic decision-support systems, i.e., recommender systems, are popular
digital tools that help tourists decide which places and attractions to
explore. However, algorithms often unintentionally direct tourist streams in a
way that negatively affects the environment, local communities, or other
stakeholders. This issue can be partly attributed to the computer science
community's limited understanding of the complex relationships and trade-offs
among stakeholders in the real world.
  In this work, we draw on the practical findings and methods from tourism
management to inform research on multistakeholder fairness in algorithmic
decision-support. Leveraging a semi-systematic literature review, we synthesize
literature from tourism management as well as literature from computer science.
Our findings suggest that tourism management actively tries to identify the
specific needs of stakeholders and utilizes qualitative, inclusive and
participatory methods to study fairness from a normative and holistic research
perspective. In contrast, computer science lacks sufficient understanding of
the stakeholder needs and primarily considers fairness through descriptive
factors, such as measureable discrimination, while heavily relying on few
mathematically formalized fairness criteria that fail to capture the
multidimensional nature of fairness in tourism.
  With the results of this work, we aim to illustrate the shortcomings of
purely algorithmic research and stress the potential and particular need for
future interdisciplinary collaboration. We believe such a collaboration is a
fundamental and necessary step to enhance algorithmic decision-support systems
towards understanding and supporting true multistakeholder fairness in tourism.

Method: 开发了'Semantic-based Concept Retrieval using Group Steiner Tree'算法，整合领域信息增强语义感知的知识表示和数据访问，并在真实文档检索系统中实现

Result: 使用170个真实搜索查询进行性能评估，经领域专家验证，相比基线系统取得显著进步，精度达到90%，准确率达到82%

Conclusion: 所提出的语义概念检索算法通过整合领域特定知识，有效提升了文档检索系统的性能，在真实场景中表现出色

Abstract: Retrieving pertinent documents from various data sources with diverse
characteristics poses a significant challenge for Document Retrieval Systems.
The complexity of this challenge is further compounded when accounting for the
semantic relationship between data and domain knowledge. While existing
retrieval systems using semantics (usually represented as Knowledge Graphs
created from open-access resources and generic domain knowledge) hold promise
in delivering relevant outcomes, their precision may be compromised due to the
absence of domain-specific information and reliance on outdated knowledge
sources. In this research, the primary focus is on two key contributions- a)
the development of a versatile algorithm- 'Semantic-based Concept Retrieval
using Group Steiner Tree' that incorporates domain information to enhance
semantic-aware knowledge representation and data access, and b) the practical
implementation of the proposed algorithm within a document retrieval system
using real-world data. To assess the effectiveness of the SemDR system,
research work conducts performance evaluations using a benchmark consisting of
170 real-world search queries. Rigorous evaluation and verification by domain
experts are conducted to ensure the validity and accuracy of the results. The
experimental findings demonstrate substantial advancements when compared to the
baseline systems, with precision and accuracy achieving levels of 90% and 82%
respectively, signifying promising improvements.

Conclusion: SUMMA建立了将多模态信息浓缩为代表性文本的新范式，有效对齐视觉广告内容与用户查询意图，提升检索和推荐场景的效果。

Abstract: Understanding multimodal video ads is crucial for improving query-ad matching
and relevance ranking on short video platforms, enhancing advertising
effectiveness and user experience. However, the effective utilization of
multimodal information with high commercial value still largely constrained by
reliance on highly compressed video embeddings-has long been inadequate. To
address this, we propose SUMMA (the abbreviation of Summarizing MultiModal
Ads), a multimodal model that automatically processes video ads into summaries
highlighting the content of highest commercial value, thus improving their
comprehension and ranking in Douyin search-advertising systems. SUMMA is
developed via a two-stage training strategy-multimodal supervised fine-tuning
followed by reinforcement learning with a mixed reward mechanism-on
domain-specific data containing video frames and ASR/OCR transcripts,
generating commercially valuable and explainable summaries. We integrate
SUMMA-generated summaries into our production pipeline, directly enhancing the
candidate retrieval and relevance ranking stages in real search-advertising
systems. Both offline and online experiments show substantial improvements over
baselines, with online results indicating a statistically significant 1.5%
increase in advertising revenue. Our work establishes a novel paradigm for
condensing multimodal information into representative texts, effectively
aligning visual ad content with user query intent in retrieval and
recommendation scenarios.

Motivation: 传统会话推荐模型仅利用物品序列而忽略语义信息，现有LLM方法存在提示工程困难或计算成本高的问题，需要探索更有效的LLM应用方式。

Method: 提出了三种LLM应用方法：1)上下文LLM作为推荐代理；2)LLM生成表示用于语义初始化；3)LLM与数据驱动SR模型的集成。在两个真实数据集上进行综合实验验证。

Result: LLM方法在粗粒度检索(高召回率)表现优异，传统方法在细粒度排序(高MRR)表现良好。集成方法在Recall和MRR指标上均显著优于单独LLM方法、数据驱动深度学习模型和基线SR模型。

Conclusion: LLM与数据驱动SR模型的集成方法能够结合两者的优势，在会话推荐任务中取得最佳性能，为会话推荐提供了新的有效解决方案。

Abstract: Session-based recommendation (SR) models aim to recommend items to anonymous
users based on their behavior during the current session. While various SR
models in the literature utilize item sequences to predict the next item, they
often fail to leverage semantic information from item titles or descriptions
impeding session intent identification and interpretability. Recent research
has explored Large Language Models (LLMs) as promising approaches to enhance
session-based recommendations, with both prompt-based and fine-tuning based
methods being widely investigated. However, prompt-based methods struggle to
identify optimal prompts that elicit correct reasoning and lack task-specific
feedback at test time, resulting in sub-optimal recommendations. Fine-tuning
methods incorporate domain-specific knowledge but incur significant
computational costs for implementation and maintenance. In this paper, we
present multiple approaches to utilize LLMs for session-based recommendation:
(i) in-context LLMs as recommendation agents, (ii) LLM-generated
representations for semantic initialization of deep learning SR models, and
(iii) integration of LLMs with data-driven SR models. Through comprehensive
experiments on two real-world publicly available datasets, we demonstrate that
LLM-based methods excel at coarse-level retrieval (high recall values), while
traditional data-driven techniques perform well at fine-grained ranking (high
Mean Reciprocal Rank values). Furthermore, the integration of LLMs with
data-driven SR models significantly out performs both standalone LLM approaches
and data-driven deep learning models, as well as baseline SR models, in terms
of both Recall and MRR metrics.

Motivation: 现有方法在缺乏显式结构信息的数据集上微调预训练语言模型，无法有效利用结构特征和元素级语义，且缺乏包含结构元数据的数据集

Method: 提出SEAL对比学习框架，采用结构感知学习保持语义层次，使用掩码元素对齐进行细粒度语义区分

Result: 在多个现代PLM上实验显示性能持续提升，BGE-M3模型的NDCG@10从73.96%提升到77.84%，在线A/B测试也验证了效果

Conclusion: SEAL框架有效解决了长结构化文档检索中的结构信息利用问题，通过结构感知学习和细粒度对齐显著提升了检索性能

Abstract: In long structured document retrieval, existing methods typically fine-tune
pre-trained language models (PLMs) using contrastive learning on datasets
lacking explicit structural information. This practice suffers from two
critical issues: 1) current methods fail to leverage structural features and
element-level semantics effectively, and 2) the lack of datasets containing
structural metadata. To bridge these gaps, we propose \our, a novel contrastive
learning framework. It leverages structure-aware learning to preserve semantic
hierarchies and masked element alignment for fine-grained semantic
discrimination. Furthermore, we release \dataset, a long structured document
retrieval dataset with rich structural annotations. Extensive experiments on
both released and industrial datasets across various modern PLMs, along with
online A/B testing, demonstrate consistent performance improvements, boosting
NDCG@10 from 73.96\% to 77.84\% on BGE-M3. The resources are available at

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 本文提出了用户感知的无偏学习排序方法，通过建模用户个性化浏览行为来解决传统ULTR方法忽略用户差异的问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的无偏学习排序方法假设用户行为日志来自'平均'用户，忽略了不同用户在搜索和浏览行为上的差异，导致个性化偏见

Method: 提出用户感知的反倾向评分估计器，为每个查询建模用户浏览行为分布，聚合用户加权的检查概率来确定倾向性

Result: 理论证明该方法在温和假设下是无偏的，且比直接计算每个印象的用户相关倾向性具有更低的方差。在两个半合成数据集和一个真实数据集上的实验验证了有效性

Conclusion: 用户感知的ULTR方法能够有效解决个性化偏见问题，通过考虑用户差异提高了排序模型的性能

Abstract: Unbiased learning to rank (ULTR), which aims to learn unbiased ranking models
from biased user behavior logs, plays an important role in Web search. Previous
research on ULTR has studied a variety of biases in users' clicks, such as
position bias, presentation bias, and outlier bias. However, existing work
often assumes that the behavior logs are collected from an ``average'' user,
neglecting the differences between different users in their search and browsing
behaviors. In this paper, we introduce personalized factors into the ULTR
framework, which we term the user-aware ULTR problem. Through a formal causal
analysis of this problem, we demonstrate that existing user-oblivious methods
are biased when different users have different preferences over queries and
personalized propensities of examining documents. To address such a
personalized bias, we propose a novel user-aware inverse-propensity-score
estimator for learning-to-rank objectives. Specifically, our approach models
the distribution of user browsing behaviors for each query and aggregates
user-weighted examination probabilities to determine propensities. We
theoretically prove that the user-aware estimator is unbiased under some mild
assumptions and shows lower variance compared to the straightforward way of
calculating a user-dependent propensity for each impression. Finally, we
empirically verify the effectiveness of our user-aware estimator by conducting
extensive experiments on two semi-synthetic datasets and a real-world dataset.

Motivation: 现有CTR预测方法采用两阶段范式：先检索相关候选物品，再通过目标注意力提取兴趣强度向量。但检索物品与完整长行为序列之间的目标注意力相关性分布差异会导致性能下降。

Method: 提出深度多重量化网络(DMQN)：1) 使用多个独立码本将长行为序列量化为多个码字序列；2) 引入分层顺序转导单元促进码字序列交互；3) 候选物品与多个码字序列的注意力输出兴趣向量；4) 缓存码字序列中间表示以降低延迟。

Result: 在工业和公共数据集上的广泛实验证实了DMQN的有效性和效率。广告系统A/B测试显示，DMQN将CTR提高了3.5%，RPM提高了2.0%。

Conclusion: DMQN通过端到端处理长行为序列，有效缓解了目标注意力分布不一致问题，在保持高效率的同时显著提升了CTR预测性能。

Abstract: In Click-Through Rate (CTR) prediction, the long behavior sequence,
comprising the user's long period of historical interactions with items has a
vital influence on assessing the user's interest in the candidate item.
Existing approaches strike efficiency and effectiveness through a two-stage
paradigm: first retrieving hundreds of candidate-related items and then
extracting interest intensity vector through target attention. However, we
argue that the discrepancy in target attention's relevance distribution between
the retrieved items and the full long behavior sequence inevitably leads to a
performance decline. To alleviate the discrepancy, we propose the Deep Multiple
Quantization Network (DMQN) to process long behavior sequence end-to-end
through compressing the long behavior sequence. Firstly, the entire spectrum of
long behavior sequence will be quantized into multiple codeword sequences based
on multiple independent codebooks. Hierarchical Sequential Transduction Unit is
incorporated to facilitate the interaction of reduced codeword sequences. Then,
attention between the candidate and multiple codeword sequences will output the
interest vector. To enable online serving, intermediate representations of the
codeword sequences are cached, significantly reducing latency. Our extensive
experiments on both industrial and public datasets confirm the effectiveness
and efficiency of DMQN. The A/B test in our advertising system shows that DMQN
improves CTR by 3.5% and RPM by 2.0%.

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in generative AI have transformed recommender systems
through end-to-end generation. OneRec reformulates recommendation as an
autoregressive generation task, achieving high Model FLOPs Utilization. While
OneRec-V1 has shown significant empirical success in real-world deployment, two
critical challenges hinder its scalability and performance: (1) inefficient
computational allocation where 97.66% of resources are consumed by sequence
encoding rather than generation, and (2) limitations in reinforcement learning
relying solely on reward models.
  To address these challenges, we propose OneRec-V2, featuring: (1) Lazy
Decoder-Only Architecture: Eliminates encoder bottlenecks, reducing total
computation by 94% and training resources by 90%, enabling successful scaling
to 8B parameters. (2) Preference Alignment with Real-World User Interactions:
Incorporates Duration-Aware Reward Shaping and Adaptive Ratio Clipping to
better align with user preferences using real-world feedback.
  Extensive A/B tests on Kuaishou demonstrate OneRec-V2's effectiveness,
improving App Stay Time by 0.467%/0.741% while balancing multi-objective
recommendations. This work advances generative recommendation scalability and
alignment with real-world feedback, representing a step forward in the

Method: 提出两个新机制：1)过渡感知位置嵌入(TAPE)使注意力仅聚焦于域内项目；2)动态域状态表示(DDSR)存储和传递域信息而不依赖全部注意力地图

Result: 方法为大规模多域推荐系统提供了可扩展解决方案，在检索任务中展现出显著改进

Conclusion: 通过分离建模和结合域间和域内表示，该方法有效解决了多域推荐系统的计算效率问题

Abstract: Recently, autoregressive recommendation models (ARMs), such as Meta's HSTU
model, have emerged as a major breakthrough over traditional Deep Learning
Recommendation Models (DLRMs), exhibiting the highly sought-after scaling law
behaviour. However, when applied to multi-domain scenarios, the transformer
architecture's attention maps become a computational bottleneck, as they attend
to all items across every domain. To tackle this challenge, systems must
efficiently balance inter and intra-domain knowledge transfer. In this work, we
introduce a novel approach for scalable multi-domain recommendation systems by
replacing full inter-domain attention with two innovative mechanisms: 1)
Transition-Aware Positional Embeddings (TAPE): We propose novel positional
embeddings that account for domain-transition specific information. This allows
attention to be focused solely on intra-domain items, effectively reducing the
unnecessary computational cost associated with attending to irrelevant domains.
2) Dynamic Domain State Representation (DDSR): We introduce a dynamic state
representation for each domain, which is stored and accessed during subsequent
token predictions. This enables the efficient transfer of relevant domain
information without relying on full attention maps. Our method offers a
scalable solution to the challenges posed by large-scale, multi-domain
recommendation systems and demonstrates significant improvements in retrieval
tasks by separately modelling and combining inter- and intra-domain
representations.

### [204] [On the Theoretical Limitations of Embedding-Based Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21038)
*Orion Weller,Michael Boratko,Iftekhar Naim,Jinhyuk Lee*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 本文通过理论分析和实验验证，证明了向量嵌入模型在现实场景下的基本限制，尤其是在简单查询中也会遇到理论上的查询返回能力限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着向量嵌入在检索、推理、指令追随等领域的应用不断扩大，虽然有理论研究指出其存在限制，但常见假设认为这些问题只出现在不现实的查询中，而现实查询可通过更好的训练数据和更大模型来克服。本文动机在于验证这些理论限制是否真的会在现实场景中出现。

Method: 研究者从学习理论角度出发，连接知识证明向量嵌入维度限制了可能返回的top-k文档子集数量。通过实验验证这一理论即使在k=2的情况下也成立，并使用自由参数化嵌入直接在测试集上进行优化。研穖团队还创建了一个叫LIMIT的现实数据集来压力测试模型。

Result: 实验结果显示，即使是最先进的状态同期模型，在LIMIT数据集上也失败了，尽管任务本身非常简单。这证明了向量嵌入模型在现实场景下真的会遇到理论上的查询返回能力限制。

Conclusion: 这项研究显示了现有单向量范弋下嵌入模型的根本限制，并呼吁未来研究开发能够解决这一基本限制的新方法。

Abstract: Vector embeddings have been tasked with an ever-increasing set of retrieval
tasks over the years, with a nascent rise in using them for reasoning,
instruction-following, coding, and more. These new benchmarks push embeddings
to work for any query and any notion of relevance that could be given. While
prior works have pointed out theoretical limitations of vector embeddings,
there is a common assumption that these difficulties are exclusively due to
unrealistic queries, and those that are not can be overcome with better
training data and larger models. In this work, we demonstrate that we may
encounter these theoretical limitations in realistic settings with extremely
simple queries. We connect known results in learning theory, showing that the
number of top-k subsets of documents capable of being returned as the result of
some query is limited by the dimension of the embedding. We empirically show
that this holds true even if we restrict to k=2, and directly optimize on the
test set with free parameterized embeddings. We then create a realistic dataset
called LIMIT that stress tests models based on these theoretical results, and
observe that even state-of-the-art models fail on this dataset despite the
simple nature of the task. Our work shows the limits of embedding models under
the existing single vector paradigm and calls for future research to develop
methods that can resolve this fundamental limitation.

### [205] [Proactive HIV Care: AI-Based Comorbidity Prediction from Routine EHR Data](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20133)
*Solomon Russom,Dimitrios Kollias,Qianni Zhang*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: AI模型结合人口统计和实验室数据可显著提高HIV患者多并发症预测准确率，但需关注人口统计特征带来的公平性问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: HIV患者面临高并发症负担，但早期检测通常受限于症状驱动的筛查方式，需要探索基于常规电子健康记录的自动化预测方法

Method: 使用伦敦东南部2,200名HIV阳性患者数据，包含30个实验室标志物和7个人口/社会属性，比较人口统计感知模型（包含人口信息）与人口统计无感知模型（排除人口信息）的性能

Result: 在所有方法中，人口统计感知模型始终优于无感知模型。人口统计可恢复性实验显示性别和年龄可以从实验室数据中准确推断，证明了人口统计特征的预测价值和公平性考虑

Conclusion: 结合人口统计和实验室数据可以改善HIV护理中的自动化多标签并发症预测，但同时也引发了临床AI中偏见和可解释性的重要问题

Abstract: People living with HIV face a high burden of comorbidities, yet early
detection is often limited by symptom-driven screening. We evaluate the
potential of AI to predict multiple comorbidities from routinely collected
Electronic Health Records. Using data from 2,200 HIV-positive patients in South
East London, comprising 30 laboratory markers and 7 demographic/social
attributes, we compare demographic-aware models (which use both
laboratory/social variables and demographic information as input) against
demographic-unaware models (which exclude all demographic information). Across
all methods, demographic-aware models consistently outperformed unaware
counterparts. Demographic recoverability experiments revealed that gender and
age can be accurately inferred from laboratory data, underscoring both the
predictive value and fairness considerations of demographic features. These
findings show that combining demographic and laboratory data can improve
automated, multi-label comorbidity prediction in HIV care, while raising
important questions about bias and interpretability in clinical AI.

Abstract: The rise of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is presenting both technical and
ethical challenges for media organisations, creating an urgent need for
professional training. This study explores how media professionals in the
Basque Country are equipping themselves to face these challenges. Using a
mixed-method approach, it combines a survey of 504 active professionals with
in-depth interviews with six innovation leaders from major regional media
outlets. The findings reveal that only 14.1% of professionals have undergone AI
training, mostly through self-learning. Larger, internationally focused
companies are more proactive in providing training, while local and traditional
media organisations show significant gaps. Technical and managerial roles are
leading the way in adopting AI, whereas newsroom staff are notably behind. The
study highlights the pressing need to enhance AI training, with a particular
focus on ethical and technical aspects, both through in-house programmes and
formal education pathways.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着深度学习技术在医疗设备自动检测中的应用日益广泛，制造商面临欧盟AI法案等新监管框架带来的合规挑战，需要评估这些新技术在现有医疗设备合规环境中的适用性。

Method: 通过对欧盟AI法案、医疗器械法规(MDR)和美国FDA质量体系法规(QSR)的对比分析，从风险管理原则、数据集治理、模型验证、可解释性要求和部署后监控义务等方面进行高层次技术评估。

Result: 识别出深度学习自动检测系统在多方面存在监管差异和挑战，包括风险管理原则分歧、数据集治理要求、模型验证困难、可解释性需求以及部署后监控义务等。

Conclusion: 深度学习自动检测系统在医疗设备领域的应用面临复杂的监管环境，制造商需要制定适当的实施策略并咨询监管机构和法律专家来确定具体的合规路径。

Abstract: As deep learning (DL) technologies advance, their application in automated
visual inspection for Class III medical devices offers significant potential to
enhance quality assurance and reduce human error. However, the adoption of such
AI-based systems introduces new regulatory complexities--particularly under the
EU Artificial Intelligence (AI) Act, which imposes high-risk system obligations
that differ in scope and depth from established regulatory frameworks such as
the Medical Device Regulation (MDR) and the U.S. FDA Quality System Regulation
(QSR). This paper presents a high-level technical assessment of the
foresee-able challenges that manufacturers are likely to encounter when
qualifying DL-based automated inspections within the existing medical device
compliance landscape. It examines divergences in risk management principles,
dataset governance, model validation, explainability requirements, and
post-deployment monitoring obligations. The discussion also explores potential
implementation strategies and highlights areas of uncertainty, including data
retention burdens, global compliance implications, and the practical
difficulties of achieving statistical significance in validation with limited
defect data. Disclaimer: This publication is in-tended solely as an academic
and technical evaluation. It is not a substitute for le-gal advice or official
regulatory interpretation. The information presented here should not be relied

Abstract: Participatory AI, in which impacted community members and other stakeholders
are involved in the design and development of AI systems, holds promise as a
way to ensure AI is developed to meet their needs and reflect their values.
However, the process of identifying, reaching out, and engaging with all
relevant stakeholder groups, which we refer to as recruitment methodology, is
still a practical challenge in AI projects striving to adopt participatory
practices. In this paper, we investigate the challenges that researchers face
when designing and executing recruitment methodology for Participatory AI
projects, and the implications of current recruitment practice for
Participatory AI. First, we describe the recruitment methodologies used in AI
projects using a corpus of 37 projects to capture the diversity of practices in
the field and perform an initial analysis on the documentation of recruitment
practices, as well as specific strategies that researchers use to meet goals of
equity and empowerment. To complement this analysis, we interview five AI
researchers to learn about the outcomes of recruitment methodologies. We find
that these outcomes are shaped by structural conditions of their work,
researchers' own goals and expectations, and the relationships built from the
recruitment methodology and subsequent collaboration. Based on these analyses,
we provide recommendations for designing and executing relationship-forward
recruitment methods, as well as reflexive recruitment documentation practices
for Participatory AI researchers.

### [209] [Automated Quality Assessment for LLM-Based Complex Qualitative Coding: A Confidence-Diversity Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20462)
*Zhilong Zhao,Yindi Liu*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 本研究验证了基于置信度和多样性的双信号质量评估框架在复杂分析任务中的可靠性，包括法律推理、政治分析和医学分类，证明该方法可有效扩展到需要专业知识的复杂领域，并显著减少人工验证工作量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的人工编码可靠性评估在大规模应用中成本过高，而缺乏可靠的自动化质量评估方法阻碍了AI在复杂定性研究中的应用。需要验证置信度-多样性框架能否在需要专业领域知识和深度文本理解的复杂分析任务中保持可靠性。

Method: 扩展双信号质量评估方法（结合模型置信度和模型间共识），在三个复杂领域进行系统验证：法律推理（390个最高法院案例）、政治分析（645篇高度党派化文章）和医学分类（1000份临床记录）。采用系统权重优化和智能分流系统。

Result: 不确定性指标在复杂任务中保持预测有效性：外部熵与准确性呈负相关（r=-0.179至-0.273，p<0.001），置信度在两个领域呈正相关（r=0.104至0.429）。权重优化比单信号方法提升6.6%-113.7%，优化权重跨领域转移成功率达100%。智能分流系统减少44.6%的人工验证工作量。

Conclusion: 自动化质量评估可以从简单任务扩展到复杂分析任务，为扩展AI辅助的定性研究提供了实用工具。未来工作将专注于解决高分歧、低置信度情况下的长尾挑战，进一步提高筛选效率。

Abstract: While previous research demonstrated effective automated quality assessment
for accessible LLM coding tasks, a fundamental question remains: can
confidence-diversity frameworks maintain reliability for complex analytical
tasks requiring specialized domain expertise and extensive text comprehension?
Traditional inter-coder reliability measures become prohibitively expensive at
scale, yet the lack of reliable automated quality assessment methods creates
methodological barriers to AI adoption in sophisticated qualitative research.
This study extends dual-signal quality assessment combining model confidence
and inter-model consensus from accessible to complex analytical domains. We
systematically validate this approach across three domains: legal reasoning
(390 Supreme Court cases), political analysis (645 hyperpartisan articles), and
medical classification (1,000 clinical transcripts). Results demonstrate that
uncertainty-based indicators maintain predictive validity in complex tasks,
with external entropy showing consistent negative correlations with accuracy (r
= -0.179 to -0.273, p < 0.001) and confidence exhibiting positive correlations
in two domains (r = 0.104 to 0.429). Systematic weight optimization achieves
6.6 to 113.7 percent improvements over single-signal approaches, with optimized
weights transferring effectively across domains (100 percent success rate). An
intelligent triage system reduces manual verification effort by 44.6 percent
while maintaining quality standards. These findings establish that automated
quality assessment can scale from accessible to complex analytical tasks,
providing practical tools for expanding AI-assisted qualitative research.
Future work will focus on addressing long-tail challenges in high-disagreement,
low-confidence cases to further enhance screening efficiency.

TL;DR: 这篇论文通过混合方法研究在全球安全关键行业进行网络安全文化评估，发现虽然两个国家的整体网络安全文化相似，但存在不同挑战，并提出建立弹性网络安全文化需要领导参与、有针对性沟通、配套措施等关键因素。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于网络威胁越来越多地利用人类行为，仅靠技术控制无法确保组织网络安全。在安全关键行业强化网络安全文化至关重要，但现实工业环境中的实证研究很稀缺。

Method: 采用混合方法，在全球安全关键行业进行调查和半结构化访谈。选择了两个邮件洗牌演练表现相差的国家：国家1表现更好，国家2表现较差。共调查了258名员工（67%）和113名员工（30%），访谈了20名和10名参与者。

Result: 两个国家的整体网络安全文化模式相似，都显示出强烈的邮件洗牌意识和网络安全优先性，但大多数人认为邮件洗牌是主要风险且不清楚如何处理其他事故。线管是默认联系人，但报告问题的跟进不明确。关键差异包括：国家1有外部员工无法获得训练和政策，国家2的低回复率因为"邮件中无链接"政策。

Conclusion: 建立弹性网络安全文化需要领导参与、有针对性沟通、配套措施、政策与实践对齐以及定期评估。将这些元素嵌入战略中可以补充技术防御，在安全关键环境中强化可持续的网络安全。

Abstract: As cyber threats increasingly exploit human behaviour, technical controls
alone cannot ensure organisational cybersecurity (CS). Strengthening
cybersecurity culture (CSC) is vital in safety-critical industries, yet
empirical research in real-world industrial setttings is scarce. This paper
addresses this gap through a pilot mixed-methods CSC assessment in a global
safety-critical organisation. We examined employees' CS knowledge, attitudes,
behaviours, and organisational factors shaping them. A survey and
semi-structured interviews were conducted at a global organisation in
safety-critical industries, across two countries chosen for contrasting
phishing simulation performance: Country 1 stronger, Country 2 weaker. In
Country 1, 258 employees were invited (67%), in Country 2, 113 were invited
(30%). Interviews included 20 and 10 participants respectively. Overall CSC
profiles were similar but revealed distinct challenges. Both showed strong
phishing awareness and prioritised CS, yet most viewed phishing as the main
risk and lacked clarity on handling other incidents. Line managers were default
contacts, but follow-up on reported concerns was unclear. Participants
emphasized aligning CS expectations with job relevance and workflows. Key
contributors to differences emerged: Country 1 had external employees with
limited access to CS training and policies, highlighting monitoring gaps. In
Country 2, low survey response stemmed from a "no-link in email" policy. While
this policy may have boosted phishing performance, it also underscored
inconsistencies in CS practices. Findings show that resilient CSC requires
leadership involvement, targeted communication, tailored measures,
policy-practice alignment, and regular assessments. Embedding these into
strategy complements technical defences and strengthens sustainable CS in
safety-critical settings.

Conclusion: AI助手可能也存在人际关系和心理问题，需要强调质量规划、质量保证和质量控制的重要性，并为理解AI欺骗模式提供框架。

Abstract: This exploratory study examined the consistency of human-AI collaboration by
analyzing three extensive "vibe coding" sessions between a human product lead
and an AI software engineer. We investigated similarities and differences in
team dynamics, communication patterns, and development outcomes across both
projects. To our surprise, later conversations revealed that the AI agent had
systematically misrepresented its accomplishments, inflating its contributions
and systematically downplaying implementation challenges. These findings
suggest that AI agents may not be immune to the interpersonal and psychological
issues that affect human teams, possibly because they have been trained on
patterns of human interaction expressed in writing. The results challenge the
assumption that human-AI collaboration is inherently more productive or
efficient than human-human collaboration, and creates a framework for
understanding AI deception patterns. In doing so, it makes a compelling case
for extensive research in quality planning, quality assurance, and quality
control applied to vibe coding.
