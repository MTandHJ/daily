### [1] [Fast OTSU Thresholding Using Bisection Method](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16179)
*Sai Varun Kodathala*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于二分法的Otsu阈值分割算法优化实现，将计算复杂度从O(L)降低到O(log L)，在保持分割精度的同时显著提高了计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统Otsu算法需要穷举所有可能的阈值，计算效率低下，限制了其在大规模图像处理系统中的应用。

Method: 利用类间方差函数的单峰特性，采用二分法搜索最优阈值，减少计算量。

Result: 在48个标准测试图像上，方差计算减少91.63%，算法迭代减少97.21%，66.67%的测试案例获得精确阈值匹配，95.83%的偏差在5个灰度级以内。

Conclusion: 该优化方法解决了Otsu算法的计算瓶颈，适用于实时应用，同时保持了原始方法的理论基础和分割质量。

Abstract: The Otsu thresholding algorithm represents a fundamental technique in image
segmentation, yet its computational efficiency is severely limited by
exhaustive search requirements across all possible threshold values. This work
presents an optimized implementation that leverages the bisection method to
exploit the unimodal characteristics of the between-class variance function.
Our approach reduces the computational complexity from O(L) to O(log L)
evaluations while preserving segmentation accuracy. Experimental validation on
48 standard test images demonstrates a 91.63% reduction in variance
computations and 97.21% reduction in algorithmic iterations compared to
conventional exhaustive search. The bisection method achieves exact threshold
matches in 66.67% of test cases, with 95.83% exhibiting deviations within 5
gray levels. The algorithm maintains universal convergence within theoretical
logarithmic bounds while providing deterministic performance guarantees
suitable for real-time applications. This optimization addresses critical
computational bottlenecks in large-scale image processing systems without
compromising the theoretical foundations or segmentation quality of the
original Otsu method.

### [2] [Exploring the Capabilities of LLM Encoders for Image-Text Retrieval in Chest X-rays](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15234)
*Hanbin Ko,Gihun Cho,Inhyeok Baek,Donguk Kim,Joonbeom Koo,Changi Kim,Dongheon Lee,Chang Min Park*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出LLM2VEC4CXR和LLM2CLIP4CXR模型，通过使用大语言模型编码器解决放射学报告中异质性和噪声问题，提升胸片图像-文本对齐效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 放射学报告存在缩写、仅印象笔记和风格变异等异质性问题，传统方法在扩展到大规噪数据时性能会饱和甚至下降，需要更鲁棒的临床表示方法。

Method: 开发了LLM2VEC4CXR（领域适应的LLM编码器）和LLM2CLIP4CXR（双塔框架），将LLM编码器与视觉骨干网络结合，在160万胸片研究数据上训练。

Result: LLM2VEC4CXR在临床文本理解上优于BERT基线，能处理缩写和风格变异；LLM2CLIP4CXR提升了检索准确性和临床对齐分数，具有更强的跨数据集泛化能力。

Conclusion: 鲁棒性而非单纯的数据规模是多模态学习的关键，模型已发布以支持医学图像-文本表示学习的进一步研究。

Abstract: Vision-language pretraining has advanced image-text alignment, yet progress
in radiology remains constrained by the heterogeneity of clinical reports,
including abbreviations, impression-only notes, and stylistic variability.
Unlike general-domain settings where more data often leads to better
performance, naively scaling to large collections of noisy reports can plateau
or even degrade model learning. We ask whether large language model (LLM)
encoders can provide robust clinical representations that transfer across
diverse styles and better guide image-text alignment. We introduce LLM2VEC4CXR,
a domain-adapted LLM encoder for chest X-ray reports, and LLM2CLIP4CXR, a
dual-tower framework that couples this encoder with a vision backbone.
LLM2VEC4CXR improves clinical text understanding over BERT-based baselines,
handles abbreviations and style variation, and achieves strong clinical
alignment on report-level metrics. LLM2CLIP4CXR leverages these embeddings to
boost retrieval accuracy and clinically oriented scores, with stronger
cross-dataset generalization than prior medical CLIP variants. Trained on 1.6M
CXR studies from public and private sources with heterogeneous and noisy
reports, our models demonstrate that robustness -- not scale alone -- is the
key to effective multimodal learning. We release models to support further
research in medical image-text representation learning.

### [3] [ViSpec: Accelerating Vision-Language Models with Vision-Aware Speculative Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15235)
*Jialiang Kang,Han Shu,Wenshuo Li,Yingjie Zhai,Xinghao Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ViSpec是一种针对视觉语言模型（VLMs）的推测解码框架，通过轻量级视觉适配器压缩图像令牌并增强多模态一致性，实现了VLM推测解码的显著加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的推测解码技术在视觉语言模型中的应用不足，速度提升有限（<1.5倍），而多模态能力在大规模模型中变得越来越重要。

Method: 使用轻量级视觉适配器模块压缩图像令牌，保留原始图像位置信息；提取全局特征向量增强多模态一致性；通过重新利用现有数据集和生成扩展输出来构建专用训练数据集。

Result: ViSpec实现了VLM推测解码的首次显著加速，达到了可观的性能提升。

Conclusion: ViSpec框架有效解决了VLM推测解码的挑战，为大模型多模态推理加速提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Speculative decoding is a widely adopted technique for accelerating inference
in large language models (LLMs), yet its application to vision-language models
(VLMs) remains underexplored, with existing methods achieving only modest
speedups (<1.5x). This gap is increasingly significant as multimodal
capabilities become central to large-scale models. We hypothesize that large
VLMs can effectively filter redundant image information layer by layer without
compromising textual comprehension, whereas smaller draft models struggle to do
so. To address this, we introduce Vision-Aware Speculative Decoding (ViSpec), a
novel framework tailored for VLMs. ViSpec employs a lightweight vision adaptor
module to compress image tokens into a compact representation, which is
seamlessly integrated into the draft model's attention mechanism while
preserving original image positional information. Additionally, we extract a
global feature vector for each input image and augment all subsequent text
tokens with this feature to enhance multimodal coherence. To overcome the
scarcity of multimodal datasets with long assistant responses, we curate a
specialized training dataset by repurposing existing datasets and generating
extended outputs using the target VLM with modified prompts. Our training
strategy mitigates the risk of the draft model exploiting direct access to the
target model's hidden states, which could otherwise lead to shortcut learning
when training solely on target model outputs. Extensive experiments validate
ViSpec, achieving, to our knowledge, the first substantial speedup in VLM
speculative decoding.

### [4] [M-PACE: Mother Child Framework for Multimodal Compliance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15241)
*Shreyash Verma,Amit Kesari,Vinayak Trivedi,Anupam Purwar,Ratnesh Jamidar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: M-PACE是一个多模态合规检查框架，使用母-子MLLM架构统一处理视觉和文本内容，在广告合规场景中显著降低人工审核依赖和推理成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统合规框架采用分散的多阶段流程，存在操作复杂、扩展性差、难以适应动态指南的问题，需要统一的多模态处理方案。

Method: 提出M-PACE框架，采用母-子MLLM设置，让更强的母MLLM评估较小子模型的输出，实现单次处理视觉语言输入的结构化评估。

Result: 推理成本降低31倍以上，最有效模型每张图像成本仅0.0005美元，同时保持与更昂贵模型相当的准确率。

Conclusion: M-PACE在广告数据部署中实现了成本与输出质量的有效平衡，为多模态合规检查提供了实用的自动化解决方案。

Abstract: Ensuring that multi-modal content adheres to brand, legal, or
platform-specific compliance standards is an increasingly complex challenge
across domains. Traditional compliance frameworks typically rely on disjointed,
multi-stage pipelines that integrate separate modules for image classification,
text extraction, audio transcription, hand-crafted checks, and rule-based
merges. This architectural fragmentation increases operational overhead,
hampers scalability, and hinders the ability to adapt to dynamic guidelines
efficiently. With the emergence of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs),
there is growing potential to unify these workflows under a single,
general-purpose framework capable of jointly processing visual and textual
content. In light of this, we propose Multimodal Parameter Agnostic Compliance
Engine (M-PACE), a framework designed for assessing attributes across
vision-language inputs in a single pass. As a representative use case, we apply
M-PACE to advertisement compliance, demonstrating its ability to evaluate over
15 compliance-related attributes. To support structured evaluation, we
introduce a human-annotated benchmark enriched with augmented samples that
simulate challenging real-world conditions, including visual obstructions and
profanity injection. M-PACE employs a mother-child MLLM setup, demonstrating
that a stronger parent MLLM evaluating the outputs of smaller child models can
significantly reduce dependence on human reviewers, thereby automating quality
control. Our analysis reveals that inference costs reduce by over 31 times,
with the most efficient models (Gemini 2.0 Flash as child MLLM selected by
mother MLLM) operating at 0.0005 per image, compared to 0.0159 for Gemini 2.5
Pro with comparable accuracy, highlighting the trade-off between cost and
output quality achieved in real time by M-PACE in real life deployment over
advertising data.

### [5] [ProFusion: 3D Reconstruction of Protein Complex Structures from Multi-view AFM Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15242)
*Jaydeep Rade,Md Hasibul Hasan Hasib,Meric Ozturk,Baboucarr Faal,Sheng Yang,Dipali G. Sashital,Vincenzo Venditti,Baoyu Chen,Soumik Sarkar,Adarsh Krishnamurthy,Anwesha Sarkar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ProFusion是一个混合框架，结合深度学习和原子力显微镜(AFM)，通过多视角合成图像进行蛋白质复合物的3D结构重建，解决了传统AI方法在大型蛋白质复合物结构预测中的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统AI方法在预测大型蛋白质复合物结构时因缺少3D空间线索而表现不佳，而实验方法如冷冻电镜成本高且耗时。需要开发一种准确且成本效益高的替代方案。

Method: 开发虚拟AFM框架生成大规模合成AFM图像数据集，训练条件扩散模型合成新视角，使用实例特定NeRF模型进行3D重建。

Result: 重建的3D蛋白质结构在AFM成像分辨率内达到平均Chamfer距离，显示出高结构保真度，并在实验AFM图像上得到广泛验证。

Conclusion: 该方法展示了在准确、成本效益高的蛋白质复合物结构预测和快速迭代验证方面的强大潜力。

Abstract: AI-based in silico methods have improved protein structure prediction but
often struggle with large protein complexes (PCs) involving multiple
interacting proteins due to missing 3D spatial cues. Experimental techniques
like Cryo-EM are accurate but costly and time-consuming. We present ProFusion,
a hybrid framework that integrates a deep learning model with Atomic Force
Microscopy (AFM), which provides high-resolution height maps from random
orientations, naturally yielding multi-view data for 3D reconstruction.
However, generating a large-scale AFM imaging data set sufficient to train deep
learning models is impractical. Therefore, we developed a virtual AFM framework
that simulates the imaging process and generated a dataset of ~542,000 proteins
with multi-view synthetic AFM images. We train a conditional diffusion model to
synthesize novel views from unposed inputs and an instance-specific Neural
Radiance Field (NeRF) model to reconstruct 3D structures. Our reconstructed 3D
protein structures achieve an average Chamfer Distance within the AFM imaging
resolution, reflecting high structural fidelity. Our method is extensively
validated on experimental AFM images of various PCs, demonstrating strong
potential for accurate, cost-effective protein complex structure prediction and
rapid iterative validation using AFM experiments.

### [6] [Multi-Modal Interpretability for Enhanced Localization in Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15243)
*Muhammad Imran,Yugyung Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了多模态可解释学习(MMEL)框架，通过分层语义关系模块增强视觉语言模型的可解释性，同时保持高性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在安全关键应用中，视觉语言模型面临复杂对象关系、细微视觉线索以及对透明度和可靠性更高要求的挑战。

Method: 基于梯度解释方法(Grad-eclip)，引入分层语义关系模块，采用多尺度特征处理、自适应注意力加权和跨模态对齐技术。

Result: 在标准数据集上的实验表明，MMEL能生成更聚焦和上下文感知的可视化结果，更好地反映视觉语言模型处理复杂场景的方式。

Conclusion: MMEL框架在不同领域具有通用性，为需要高可解释性和可靠性的应用提供了有价值的模型决策洞察。

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models have significantly expanded the
frontiers of automated image analysis. However, applying these models in
safety-critical contexts remains challenging due to the complex relationships
between objects, subtle visual cues, and the heightened demand for transparency
and reliability. This paper presents the Multi-Modal Explainable Learning
(MMEL) framework, designed to enhance the interpretability of vision-language
models while maintaining high performance. Building upon prior work in
gradient-based explanations for transformer architectures (Grad-eclip), MMEL
introduces a novel Hierarchical Semantic Relationship Module that enhances
model interpretability through multi-scale feature processing, adaptive
attention weighting, and cross-modal alignment. Our approach processes features
at multiple semantic levels to capture relationships between image regions at
different granularities, applying learnable layer-specific weights to balance
contributions across the model's depth. This results in more comprehensive
visual explanations that highlight both primary objects and their contextual
relationships with improved precision. Through extensive experiments on
standard datasets, we demonstrate that by incorporating semantic relationship
information into gradient-based attribution maps, MMEL produces more focused
and contextually aware visualizations that better reflect how vision-language
models process complex scenes. The MMEL framework generalizes across various
domains, offering valuable insights into model decisions for applications
requiring high interpretability and reliability.

### [7] [Walk and Read Less: Improving the Efficiency of Vision-and-Language Navigation via Tuning-Free Multimodal Token Pruning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15250)
*Wenda Qin,Andrea Burns,Bryan A. Plummer,Margrit Betke*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种针对视觉语言导航任务的导航感知剪枝方法，通过预过滤令牌为前景和背景，专注于剪枝背景令牌以减少信息损失，同时避免增加导航路径长度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型模型在视觉语言导航任务中表现优异，但在资源受限环境中运行成本高。现有剪枝方法未能解决VLN特有的挑战，如信息损失可能导致更长的导航路径，从而抵消剪枝带来的效率提升。

Method: 提出导航感知剪枝方法，利用导航特定特征将令牌预过滤为前景和背景，例如基于代理能否朝该方向导航来过滤图像视图，并使用大型语言模型提取导航相关指令。剪枝主要针对背景令牌，并通过移除低重要性导航节点来避免回溯。

Result: 在标准VLN基准测试中，NAP方法显著优于现有工作，在节省超过50%FLOPS的同时保持了更高的成功率。

Conclusion: 导航感知剪枝方法有效解决了VLN任务中的剪枝挑战，在保持性能的同时显著提升了计算效率。

Abstract: Large models achieve strong performance on Vision-and-Language Navigation
(VLN) tasks, but are costly to run in resource-limited environments. Token
pruning offers appealing tradeoffs for efficiency with minimal performance loss
by reducing model input size, but prior work overlooks VLN-specific challenges.
For example, information loss from pruning can effectively increase
computational cost due to longer walks. Thus, the inability to identify
uninformative tokens undermines the supposed efficiency gains from pruning. To
address this, we propose Navigation-Aware Pruning (NAP), which uses
navigation-specific traits to simplify the pruning process by pre-filtering
tokens into foreground and background. For example, image views are filtered
based on whether the agent can navigate in that direction. We also extract
navigation-relevant instructions using a Large Language Model. After filtering,
we focus pruning on background tokens, minimizing information loss. To further
help avoid increases in navigation length, we discourage backtracking by
removing low-importance navigation nodes. Experiments on standard VLN
benchmarks show NAP significantly outperforms prior work, preserving higher
success rates while saving more than 50% FLOPS.

### [8] [RespoDiff: Dual-Module Bottleneck Transformation for Responsible & Faithful T2I Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15257)
*Silpa Vadakkeeveetil Sreelatha,Sauradip Nag,Muhammad Awais,Serge Belongie,Anjan Dutta*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RespoDiff是一个用于负责任文本到图像生成的新框架，通过在扩散模型的中间瓶颈表示上引入双模块转换，同时确保语义对齐和图像质量，在公平性和安全性方面优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在文本到图像生成方面取得了快速进展，但确保公平性和安全性仍然是一个开放挑战。现有方法通常在提高公平性和安全性时会牺牲语义保真度和图像质量。

Method: 提出RespoDiff框架，在扩散模型的中间瓶颈表示上实施双模块转换：一个模块专注于捕获和执行负责任概念（如公平性和安全性），另一个模块致力于保持与中性提示的语义对齐。引入新的分数匹配目标来促进双学习过程。

Result: 该方法在负责任生成方面优于最先进方法，确保语义对齐的同时优化两个目标而不损害图像保真度。在多样未见提示上，负责任和语义连贯的生成提高了20%。可无缝集成到SDXL等大规模模型中。

Conclusion: RespoDiff提供了一种有效的解决方案，能够在保持高质量图像生成的同时显著提升文本到图像生成系统的公平性和安全性。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of diffusion models has enabled high-fidelity and
semantically rich text-to-image generation; however, ensuring fairness and
safety remains an open challenge. Existing methods typically improve fairness
and safety at the expense of semantic fidelity and image quality. In this work,
we propose RespoDiff, a novel framework for responsible text-to-image
generation that incorporates a dual-module transformation on the intermediate
bottleneck representations of diffusion models. Our approach introduces two
distinct learnable modules: one focused on capturing and enforcing responsible
concepts, such as fairness and safety, and the other dedicated to maintaining
semantic alignment with neutral prompts. To facilitate the dual learning
process, we introduce a novel score-matching objective that enables effective
coordination between the modules. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art
methods in responsible generation by ensuring semantic alignment while
optimizing both objectives without compromising image fidelity. Our approach
improves responsible and semantically coherent generation by 20% across
diverse, unseen prompts. Moreover, it integrates seamlessly into large-scale
models like SDXL, enhancing fairness and safety. Code will be released upon
acceptance.

### [9] [Autoguided Online Data Curation for Diffusion Model Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15267)
*Valeria Pais,Luis Oala,Daniele Faccio,Marco Aversa*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究探讨了自动引导和在线数据选择方法是否能提高扩散模型的训练效率和样本效率。通过整合JEST和自动引导方法，在2D合成数据和图像生成任务上进行评估，发现自动引导能持续提升样本质量和多样性，而早期数据选择仅在训练初期有优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成模型的计算成本重新激发了高效数据管理的需求，希望探索自动引导和在线数据选择方法是否能改善扩散模型的训练时间和样本效率。

Method: 将联合示例选择（JEST）和自动引导整合到统一代码库中，在2D合成数据生成和3x64x64图像生成任务上进行控制实验，比较不同数据管理方法在相同训练时间和样本数量下的效果。

Result: 自动引导在所有实验中都能持续提升样本质量和多样性。早期AJEST在数据效率上能匹配或略微超过单独使用自动引导，但其时间开销和复杂性使得在大多数情况下自动引导或均匀随机选择更优。

Conclusion: 虽然有针对性的在线选择在早期训练中能带来效率提升，但稳健的样本质量改进主要由自动引导驱动。数据选择仅在特定情况下可能有益。

Abstract: The costs of generative model compute rekindled promises and hopes for
efficient data curation. In this work, we investigate whether recently
developed autoguidance and online data selection methods can improve the time
and sample efficiency of training generative diffusion models. We integrate
joint example selection (JEST) and autoguidance into a unified code base for
fast ablation and benchmarking. We evaluate combinations of data curation on a
controlled 2-D synthetic data generation task as well as (3x64x64)-D image
generation. Our comparisons are made at equal wall-clock time and equal number
of samples, explicitly accounting for the overhead of selection. Across
experiments, autoguidance consistently improves sample quality and diversity.
Early AJEST (applying selection only at the beginning of training) can match or
modestly exceed autoguidance alone in data efficiency on both tasks. However,
its time overhead and added complexity make autoguidance or uniform random data
selection preferable in most situations. These findings suggest that while
targeted online selection can yield efficiency gains in early training, robust
sample quality improvements are primarily driven by autoguidance. We discuss
limitations and scope, and outline when data selection may be beneficial.

### [10] [PRISM: Phase-enhanced Radial-based Image Signature Mapping framework for fingerprinting AI-generated images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15270)
*Emanuele Ricco,Elia Onofri,Lorenzo Cima,Stefano Cresci,Roberto Di Pietro*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PRISM是一个基于相位增强径向图像签名映射的框架，用于指纹识别AI生成图像，通过离散傅里叶变换的径向缩减来捕获模型特定签名，在模型归因任务中达到92.04%的准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着生成式AI的发展，迫切需要能够识别AI生成内容来源模型的归因方法，特别是在商业环境中，用户期望获得内容来源的保证。

Method: PRISM框架基于离散傅里叶变换的径向缩减，利用幅度和相位信息捕获模型特定签名，然后通过线性判别分析进行聚类，实现可靠的模型归因。

Result: 在PRISM-36K数据集上达到92.04%的归因准确率，在四个基准测试中平均准确率为81.60%，在真实vs伪造图像检测任务中平均准确率为88.41%，在GenImage上达到95.06%的最佳结果。

Conclusion: 频域指纹识别在跨架构和跨数据集的模型归因中表现出有效性，为生成式AI系统的问责和信任提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: A critical need has emerged for generative AI: attribution methods. That is,
solutions that can identify the model originating AI-generated content. This
feature, generally relevant in multimodal applications, is especially sensitive
in commercial settings where users subscribe to paid proprietary services and
expect guarantees about the source of the content they receive. To address
these issues, we introduce PRISM, a scalable Phase-enhanced Radial-based Image
Signature Mapping framework for fingerprinting AI-generated images. PRISM is
based on a radial reduction of the discrete Fourier transform that leverages
amplitude and phase information to capture model-specific signatures. The
output of the above process is subsequently clustered via linear discriminant
analysis to achieve reliable model attribution in diverse settings, even if the
model's internal details are inaccessible. To support our work, we construct
PRISM-36K, a novel dataset of 36,000 images generated by six text-to-image GAN-
and diffusion-based models. On this dataset, PRISM achieves an attribution
accuracy of 92.04%. We additionally evaluate our method on four benchmarks from
the literature, reaching an average accuracy of 81.60%. Finally, we evaluate
our methodology also in the binary task of detecting real vs fake images,
achieving an average accuracy of 88.41%. We obtain our best result on GenImage
with an accuracy of 95.06%, whereas the original benchmark achieved 82.20%. Our
results demonstrate the effectiveness of frequency-domain fingerprinting for
cross-architecture and cross-dataset model attribution, offering a viable
solution for enforcing accountability and trust in generative AI systems.

### [11] [Large Vision Models Can Solve Mental Rotation Problems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15271)

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文系统评估了ViT、CLIP、DINOv2和DINOv3在心理旋转任务上的表现，发现自监督ViT比监督ViT更能捕捉几何结构，中间层表现优于最终层，任务难度随旋转复杂性和遮挡增加而增加。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 心理旋转是人类空间推理的关键测试，但现代视觉Transformer是否具备类似能力尚不清楚。本文旨在系统评估不同视觉Transformer模型在心理旋转任务上的表现。

Method: 通过逐层探测模型表示，评估ViT、CLIP、DINOv2和DINOv3在从简单块结构到复杂块图形、三种文本类型和照片级真实物体的一系列心理旋转任务上的表现。

Result: 自监督ViT比监督ViT更能捕捉几何结构；中间层表现优于最终层；任务难度随旋转复杂性和遮挡增加而增加，与人类反应时间相似。

Conclusion: 视觉Transformer在心理旋转任务上表现出与人类相似的约束模式，自监督学习有助于模型更好地理解几何结构。

Abstract: Mental rotation is a key test of spatial reasoning in humans and has been
central to understanding how perception supports cognition. Despite the success
of modern vision transformers, it is still unclear how well these models
develop similar abilities. In this work, we present a systematic evaluation of
ViT, CLIP, DINOv2, and DINOv3 across a range of mental-rotation tasks, from
simple block structures similar to those used by Shepard and Metzler to study
human cognition, to more complex block figures, three types of text, and
photo-realistic objects. By probing model representations layer by layer, we
examine where and how these networks succeed. We find that i) self-supervised
ViTs capture geometric structure better than supervised ViTs; ii) intermediate
layers perform better than final layers; iii) task difficulty increases with
rotation complexity and occlusion, mirroring human reaction times and
suggesting similar constraints in embedding space representations.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文系统评估了自监督学习预训练的ViT模型在未经额外特征变换的情况下，其内在表示能力在图像分类和分割任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常对预训练的ViT特征进行额外处理以获得更好的任务性能，但缺乏对未经修改的ViT特征内在表示能力的全面分析。

Method: 使用基于超平面（如逻辑回归）或余弦相似度的分类和分割规则，分析不同token类型、任务和预训练ViT模型，无需额外特征变换。

Result: 在标准数据集上进行了详细分析，提供了关于token类型和决策规则选择的见解。

Conclusion: 该研究为基于任务、上下文和预训练目标选择最优token类型和决策规则提供了指导。

Abstract: Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) for Vision Transformers (ViTs) has recently
demonstrated considerable potential as a pre-training strategy for a variety of
computer vision tasks, including image classification and segmentation, both in
standard and few-shot downstream contexts. Two pre-training objectives dominate
the landscape of SSL techniques: Contrastive Learning and Masked Image
Modeling. Features (or tokens) extracted from the final transformer attention
block -- specifically, the keys, queries, and values -- as well as features
obtained after the final block's feed-forward layer, have become a common
foundation for addressing downstream tasks. However, in many existing
approaches, these pre-trained ViT features are further processed through
additional transformation layers, often involving lightweight heads or combined
with distillation, to achieve superior task performance. Although such methods
can improve task outcomes, to the best of our knowledge, a comprehensive
analysis of the intrinsic representation capabilities of unaltered ViT features
has yet to be conducted. This study aims to bridge this gap by systematically
evaluating the use of these unmodified features across image classification and
segmentation tasks, in both standard and few-shot contexts. The classification
and segmentation rules that we use are either hyperplane based (as in logistic
regression) or cosine-similarity based, both of which rely on the presence of
interpretable directions in the ViT's latent space. Based on the previous rules
and without the use of additional feature transformations, we conduct an
analysis across token types, tasks, and pre-trained ViT models. This study
provides insights into the optimal choice for token type and decision rule
based on the task, context, and the pre-training objective, while reporting
detailed findings on two widely-used datasets.

Abstract: Embodied agents operating in the physical world must make decisions that are
not only effective but also safe, spatially coherent, and grounded in context.
While recent advances in large multimodal models (LMMs) have shown promising
capabilities in visual understanding and language generation, their ability to
perform structured reasoning for real-world embodied tasks remains
underexplored. In this work, we aim to understand how well foundation models
can perform step-by-step reasoning in embodied environments. To this end, we
propose the Foundation Model Embodied Reasoning (FoMER) benchmark, designed to
evaluate the reasoning capabilities of LMMs in complex embodied decision-making
scenarios. Our benchmark spans a diverse set of tasks that require agents to
interpret multimodal observations, reason about physical constraints and
safety, and generate valid next actions in natural language. We present (i) a

*Min Zhang,Bo Jiang,Jie Zhou,Yimeng Liu,Xin Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的条件域提示学习方法（CoDoL），通过利用现成的域信息构建提示并改善视觉-语言嵌入对齐，以提升OOD泛化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决基于提示的CLIP方法存在的两个问题：1）不准确的文本描述导致精度和鲁棒性下降；2）有限的视觉-语言嵌入对齐影响泛化性能。

Method: 提出CoDoL方法，利用域信息形成提示，并设计轻量级域元网络（DMN）生成每个域中图像的输入条件标记，以捕获实例特定和域特定信息。

Result: 在四个OOD基准测试（PACS、VLCS、OfficeHome和DigitDG）上的广泛实验验证了CoDoL在改善视觉-语言嵌入对齐和OOD泛化性能方面的有效性。

Conclusion: CoDoL方法通过条件域提示学习和域元网络，有效提升了视觉-语言模型的OOD泛化能力。

Abstract: Recent advances in pre-training vision-language models (VLMs), e.g.,
contrastive language-image pre-training (CLIP) methods, have shown great
potential in learning out-of-distribution (OOD) representations. Despite
showing competitive performance, the prompt-based CLIP methods still suffer
from: i) inaccurate text descriptions, which leads to degraded accuracy and
robustness, and poses a challenge for zero-shot CLIP methods. ii) limited
vision-language embedding alignment, which significantly affects the
generalization performance. To tackle the above issues, this paper proposes a
novel Conditional Domain prompt Learning (CoDoL) method, which utilizes
readily-available domain information to form prompts and improves the
vision-language embedding alignment for improving OOD generalization. To
capture both instance-specific and domain-specific information, we further
propose a lightweight Domain Meta Network (DMN) to generate input-conditional
tokens for images in each domain. Extensive experiments on four OOD benchmarks
(PACS, VLCS, OfficeHome and DigitDG) validate the effectiveness of our proposed
CoDoL in terms of improving the vision-language embedding alignment as well as
the out-of-distribution generalization performance.

TL;DR: AdaptiveNN是一个从被动视觉处理转向主动自适应视觉的框架，通过序列化注视机制实现高效视觉感知，在17个基准测试中达到28倍推理成本降低，同时保持精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人类视觉通过选择性注视高效处理复杂环境，而现有机器视觉模型被动处理整个场景，导致资源需求随分辨率线性增长，限制了实际应用和未来发展。

Method: 将视觉感知建模为从粗到精的序列决策过程，结合表示学习和自奖励强化学习，端到端训练非可微分的自适应神经网络，无需额外的注视位置监督。

Result: 在9个任务的17个基准测试中，AdaptiveNN实现高达28倍的推理成本降低，灵活适应不同任务需求和资源预算，提供更好的可解释性，并展现出类人的感知行为。

Conclusion: AdaptiveNN为高效、灵活和可解释的计算机视觉提供了有前景的途径，同时作为研究视觉认知的潜在工具，展现出与人类相似的感知特性。

Abstract: Human vision is highly adaptive, efficiently sampling intricate environments
by sequentially fixating on task-relevant regions. In contrast, prevailing
machine vision models passively process entire scenes at once, resulting in
excessive resource demands scaling with spatial-temporal input resolution and
model size, yielding critical limitations impeding both future advancements and
real-world application. Here we introduce AdaptiveNN, a general framework
aiming to drive a paradigm shift from 'passive' to 'active, adaptive' vision
models. AdaptiveNN formulates visual perception as a coarse-to-fine sequential
decision-making process, progressively identifying and attending to regions
pertinent to the task, incrementally combining information across fixations,
and actively concluding observation when sufficient. We establish a theory
integrating representation learning with self-rewarding reinforcement learning,
enabling end-to-end training of the non-differentiable AdaptiveNN without
additional supervision on fixation locations. We assess AdaptiveNN on 17
benchmarks spanning 9 tasks, including large-scale visual recognition,
fine-grained discrimination, visual search, processing images from real driving
and medical scenarios, language-driven embodied AI, and side-by-side
comparisons with humans. AdaptiveNN achieves up to 28x inference cost reduction
without sacrificing accuracy, flexibly adapts to varying task demands and
resource budgets without retraining, and provides enhanced interpretability via
its fixation patterns, demonstrating a promising avenue toward efficient,
flexible, and interpretable computer vision. Furthermore, AdaptiveNN exhibits
closely human-like perceptual behaviors in many cases, revealing its potential
as a valuable tool for investigating visual cognition. Code is available at

*Jiuyi Xu,Qing Jin,Meida Chen,Andrew Feng,Yang Sui,Yangming Shi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LowDiff是一种基于级联方法的新型高效扩散框架，通过从低分辨率到高分辨率的渐进式生成，显著提高了扩散模型的采样速度，在保持或提升生成质量的同时实现了超过50%的吞吐量提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在图像生成方面取得了显著成功，但实际应用受到采样速度慢的限制。先前的研究主要集中在压缩模型或减少去噪步骤数量，而忽略了在生成过程中利用多分辨率输入的可能性。

Method: 提出LowDiff框架，采用级联方法生成逐渐提高分辨率的输出，使用统一模型从低分辨率逐步细化到目标分辨率。该方法适用于像素空间和潜在空间的扩散模型。

Result: 在CIFAR-10、FFHQ和ImageNet上的实验表明，该方法在保持可比或更好质量的同时实现了显著的效率提升。在无条件CIFAR-10上FID为2.11，IS为9.87；在条件CIFAR-10上FID为1.94，IS为10.03；在ImageNet 256x256上FID为4.00，IS为195.06。

Conclusion: LowDiff通过创新的架构设计和生成技术，在减少高分辨率采样步骤的同时实现了可比甚至更优的性能，为扩散模型的实际应用提供了高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in image generation but
their practical application is often hindered by the slow sampling speed. Prior
efforts of improving efficiency primarily focus on compressing models or
reducing the total number of denoising steps, largely neglecting the
possibility to leverage multiple input resolutions in the generation process.
In this work, we propose LowDiff, a novel and efficient diffusion framework
based on a cascaded approach by generating increasingly higher resolution
outputs. Besides, LowDiff employs a unified model to progressively refine
images from low resolution to the desired resolution. With the proposed
architecture design and generation techniques, we achieve comparable or even
superior performance with much fewer high-resolution sampling steps. LowDiff is
applicable to diffusion models in both pixel space and latent space. Extensive
experiments on both conditional and unconditional generation tasks across
CIFAR-10, FFHQ and ImageNet demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of our
method. Results show over 50% throughput improvement across all datasets and
settings while maintaining comparable or better quality. On unconditional
CIFAR-10, LowDiff achieves an FID of 2.11 and IS of 9.87, while on conditional
CIFAR-10, an FID of 1.94 and IS of 10.03. On FFHQ 64x64, LowDiff achieves an
FID of 2.43, and on ImageNet 256x256, LowDiff built on LightningDiT-B/1
produces high-quality samples with a FID of 4.00 and an IS of 195.06, together
with substantial efficiency gains.

*Yu Chang,Jiahao Chen,Anzhe Cheng,Paul Bogdan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MaskAttn-SDXL是一种针对Stable Diffusion XL的改进方法，通过在交叉注意力logits中注入二进制掩码来减少多对象提示中的组合失败问题，提高空间合规性和属性绑定。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文本到图像扩散模型在实现高真实感的同时，经常在处理包含多个对象、属性和空间关系的提示时出现组合失败，导致实体纠缠、属性混淆和空间线索违反等问题。

Method: 提出MaskAttn-SDXL，在SDXL的UNet交叉注意力logits中应用区域级门控机制，为每层学习一个二进制掩码，在softmax之前注入到交叉注意力logit图中，稀疏化token与潜在空间之间的交互，仅保留语义相关的连接。

Result: 该方法在保持整体图像质量和多样性的同时，显著提高了多对象提示中的空间合规性和属性绑定性能，且无需位置编码、辅助token或外部区域掩码，推理路径基本保持不变，开销极小。

Conclusion: logit级别的掩码交叉注意力是实现组合控制的数据高效原语，该方法为文本到图像生成中的空间控制提供了实用的扩展方案。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models achieve impressive realism but often suffer
from compositional failures on prompts with multiple objects, attributes, and
spatial relations, resulting in cross-token interference where entities
entangle, attributes mix across objects, and spatial cues are violated. To
address these failures, we propose MaskAttn-SDXL,a region-level gating
mechanism applied to the cross-attention logits of Stable Diffusion XL(SDXL)'s
UNet. MaskAttn-SDXL learns a binary mask per layer, injecting it into each
cross-attention logit map before softmax to sparsify token-to-latent
interactions so that only semantically relevant connections remain active. The
method requires no positional encodings, auxiliary tokens, or external region
masks, and preserves the original inference path with negligible overhead. In
practice, our model improves spatial compliance and attribute binding in
multi-object prompts while preserving overall image quality and diversity.
These findings demonstrate that logit-level maksed cross-attention is an
data-efficient primitve for enforcing compositional control, and our method
thus serves as a practical extension for spatial control in text-to-image
generation.

*Mst Tasnim Pervin,George Bebis,Fang Jiang,Alireza Tavakkoli*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RaceGAN是一种新颖的多域图像到图像转换框架，专门用于种族属性转换，能够在保持个体特征和高层语义的同时映射多个域的风格代码，无需参考图像。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型如CycleGAN、StarGAN等在种族特征转换方面存在限制，要么只能处理成对域，要么无法深入映射低层风格变化，或者需要额外参考图像且无法保持个体特征。

Method: 提出RaceGAN框架，通过多域图像到图像转换技术，在种族属性转换过程中映射风格代码，同时保持个体性和高层语义，无需依赖参考图像。

Result: 在芝加哥人脸数据集上的测试表明，RaceGAN在亚洲人、白人和黑人种族特征转换方面优于其他模型，并通过InceptionReNetv2分类验证了其有效性。模型还能将潜在空间划分为不同种族群体的清晰聚类。

Conclusion: RaceGAN在种族特征转换任务中表现出色，能够有效保持个体特征的同时实现高质量的多域风格映射，为种族属性转换提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Generative adversarial networks (GANs) have demonstrated significant progress
in unpaired image-to-image translation in recent years for several
applications. CycleGAN was the first to lead the way, although it was
restricted to a pair of domains. StarGAN overcame this constraint by tackling
image-to-image translation across various domains, although it was not able to
map in-depth low-level style changes for these domains. Style mapping via
reference-guided image synthesis has been made possible by the innovations of
StarGANv2 and StyleGAN. However, these models do not maintain individuality and
need an extra reference image in addition to the input. Our study aims to
translate racial traits by means of multi-domain image-to-image translation. We
present RaceGAN, a novel framework capable of mapping style codes over several
domains during racial attribute translation while maintaining individuality and
high level semantics without relying on a reference image. RaceGAN outperforms
other models in translating racial features (i.e., Asian, White, and Black)
when tested on Chicago Face Dataset. We also give quantitative findings
utilizing InceptionReNetv2-based classification to demonstrate the
effectiveness of our racial translation. Moreover, we investigate how well the
model partitions the latent space into distinct clusters of faces for each
ethnic group.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习模型缺乏可解释性，现有方法要么局限于单个图像的局部视觉解释，要么需要大量标注成本的概念解释方法

Method: 利用少量图像的用户定义部件标签，通过高效迁移技术扩展到大数据集，聚合部件级局部解释形成全局符号解释

Result: 能够在大规模上为模型决策提供人类可理解的解释，避免了传统概念解释方法的高标注成本

Conclusion: 该方法在保持解释质量的同时显著降低了标注需求，为深度学习模型提供了实用的全局可解释性解决方案

Abstract: Deep learning models are notoriously opaque. Existing explanation methods
often focus on localized visual explanations for individual images.
Concept-based explanations, while offering global insights, require extensive
annotations, incurring significant labeling cost. We propose an approach that
leverages user-defined part labels from a limited set of images and efficiently
transfers them to a larger dataset. This enables the generation of global
symbolic explanations by aggregating part-based local explanations, ultimately
providing human-understandable explanations for model decisions on a large
scale.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种因果指纹概念，通过因果解耦框架从生成模型中提取语义不变的模型指纹，用于源归属和身份保护。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖模型特定线索或合成伪影，产生的指纹泛化能力有限。本文认为完整的模型指纹应反映图像来源与模型痕迹之间的因果关系。

Method: 提出因果解耦框架，在预训练扩散重建残差的语义不变潜在空间中，将因果指纹从图像特定内容和风格中解耦，并通过多样化特征表示增强指纹粒度。

Result: 实验表明该方法在GAN和扩散模型的源归属任务中优于现有方法，并通过反事实示例实现源匿名化。

Conclusion: 该方法在伪造检测、模型版权追踪和身份保护方面具有强大潜力。

Abstract: AI generative models leave implicit traces in their generated images, which
are commonly referred to as model fingerprints and are exploited for source
attribution. Prior methods rely on model-specific cues or synthesis artifacts,
yielding limited fingerprints that may generalize poorly across different
generative models. We argue that a complete model fingerprint should reflect
the causality between image provenance and model traces, a direction largely
unexplored. To this end, we conceptualize the \emph{causal fingerprint} of
generative models, and propose a causality-decoupling framework that
disentangles it from image-specific content and style in a semantic-invariant
latent space derived from pre-trained diffusion reconstruction residual. We
further enhance fingerprint granularity with diverse feature representations.
We validate causality by assessing attribution performance across
representative GANs and diffusion models and by achieving source anonymization
using counterfactual examples generated from causal fingerprints. Experiments
show our approach outperforms existing methods in model attribution, indicating
strong potential for forgery detection, model copyright tracing, and identity
protection.

TL;DR: 开发了针对神经肿瘤学的专用基础模型，采用分布鲁棒优化方法，提高了跨机构泛化能力和罕见分子标记预测性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经肿瘤学数据异质性和肿瘤复杂性限制了基础模型的泛化能力，现有模型在预测罕见分子标记方面表现不佳，而这些标记对治疗反应和风险分层至关重要

Method: 在多机构脑肿瘤MRI上预训练自监督骨干网络（BYOL、DINO、MAE、MoCo），应用分布鲁棒优化（DRO）来减轻站点和类别不平衡问题

Result: 方法显著改善了分子预测性能，减少了站点特异性嵌入差异。在CUIMC，平均平衡准确率从0.744提升到0.785，AUC从0.656提升到0.676，对代表性不足的终点提升最大。生存预测的c-index在所有站点都有改善

Conclusion: 将基础模型与DRO结合能够产生更站点不变的表征，改善常见和罕见标记的预测，增强生存区分能力，强调了前瞻性验证和整合纵向及干预信号的必要性

Abstract: Neuro-oncology poses unique challenges for machine learning due to
heterogeneous data and tumor complexity, limiting the ability of foundation
models (FMs) to generalize across cohorts. Existing FMs also perform poorly in
predicting uncommon molecular markers, which are essential for treatment
response and risk stratification. To address these gaps, we developed a
neuro-oncology specific FM with a distributionally robust loss function,
enabling accurate estimation of tumor phenotypes while maintaining
cross-institution generalization. We pretrained self-supervised backbones
(BYOL, DINO, MAE, MoCo) on multi-institutional brain tumor MRI and applied
distributionally robust optimization (DRO) to mitigate site and class
imbalance. Downstream tasks included molecular classification of common markers
(MGMT, IDH1, 1p/19q, EGFR), uncommon alterations (ATRX, TP53, CDKN2A/2B, TERT),
continuous markers (Ki-67, TP53), and overall survival prediction in IDH1
wild-type glioblastoma at UCSF, UPenn, and CUIMC. Our method improved molecular
prediction and reduced site-specific embedding differences. At CUIMC, mean
balanced accuracy rose from 0.744 to 0.785 and AUC from 0.656 to 0.676, with
the largest gains for underrepresented endpoints (CDKN2A/2B accuracy 0.86 to
0.92, AUC 0.73 to 0.92; ATRX AUC 0.69 to 0.82; Ki-67 accuracy 0.60 to 0.69).
For survival, c-index improved at all sites: CUIMC 0.592 to 0.597, UPenn 0.647
to 0.672, UCSF 0.600 to 0.627. Grad-CAM highlighted tumor and peri-tumoral
regions, confirming interpretability. Overall, coupling FMs with DRO yields
more site-invariant representations, improves prediction of common and uncommon
markers, and enhances survival discrimination, underscoring the need for
prospective validation and integration of longitudinal and interventional
signals to advance precision neuro-oncology.

TL;DR: ORCA是一个基于代理推理的框架，通过观察-推理-批判-行动的循环机制，利用小型视觉模型提升大型视觉语言模型的准确性，减少幻觉和对抗攻击的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型存在幻觉问题和对抗攻击脆弱性，限制了其在实际应用中的可靠性。

Method: 采用观察-推理-批判-行动循环，查询多个视觉工具进行证据验证，检测跨模型不一致性，并通过迭代优化预测结果，无需访问模型内部或重新训练。

Result: 在POPE幻觉基准测试中，ORCA将独立LVLM性能提升3.64%到40.67%；在对抗攻击下平均准确率提升20.11%；结合防御技术后在AMBER图像上提升1.20%到48.00%。

Conclusion: ORCA为构建更可靠、鲁棒的多模态系统提供了有前景的路径。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) exhibit strong multimodal capabilities
but remain vulnerable to hallucinations from intrinsic errors and adversarial
attacks from external exploitations, limiting their reliability in real-world
applications. We present ORCA, an agentic reasoning framework that improves the
factual accuracy and adversarial robustness of pretrained LVLMs through
test-time structured inference reasoning with a suite of small vision models
(less than 3B parameters). ORCA operates via an Observe--Reason--Critique--Act
loop, querying multiple visual tools with evidential questions, validating
cross-model inconsistencies, and refining predictions iteratively without
access to model internals or retraining. ORCA also stores intermediate
reasoning traces, which supports auditable decision-making. Though designed
primarily to mitigate object-level hallucinations, ORCA also exhibits emergent
adversarial robustness without requiring adversarial training or defense
mechanisms. We evaluate ORCA across three settings: (1) clean images on
hallucination benchmarks, (2) adversarially perturbed images without defense,
and (3) adversarially perturbed images with defense applied. On the POPE
hallucination benchmark, ORCA improves standalone LVLM performance by +3.64\%
to +40.67\% across different subsets. Under adversarial perturbations on POPE,
ORCA achieves an average accuracy gain of +20.11\% across LVLMs. When combined
with defense techniques on adversarially perturbed AMBER images, ORCA further
improves standalone LVLM performance, with gains ranging from +1.20\% to
+48.00\% across evaluation metrics. These results demonstrate that ORCA offers
a promising path toward building more reliable and robust multimodal systems.

TL;DR: RAD-Conv是一种新的卷积算子，通过四个边界偏移量创建灵活的矩形区域，动态调整感受野大小和形状，结合了注意力机制的适应性和标准卷积的效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统可变形卷积局限于固定四边形采样区域，无法灵活适应复杂图像结构。需要一种既能精确控制感受野形状，又能保持计算效率的方法。

Method: 使用四个边界偏移量代替传统可变形卷积的单个偏移量，为每个卷积核元素创建可调整的矩形采样区域，实现感受野宽度和高度的解耦控制。

Result: RAD-Conv能够精确控制感受野形状，即使在1x1小卷积核下也能捕获局部细节和长距离依赖关系。

Conclusion: RAD-Conv为构建更具表达力和效率的视觉模型提供了实用解决方案，弥合了刚性卷积架构和计算成本高的注意力方法之间的差距。

Abstract: We introduce Region-Aware Deformable Convolution (RAD-Conv), a new
convolutional operator that enhances neural networks' ability to adapt to
complex image structures. Unlike traditional deformable convolutions, which are
limited to fixed quadrilateral sampling areas, RAD-Conv uses four boundary
offsets per kernel element to create flexible, rectangular regions that
dynamically adjust their size and shape to match image content. This approach
allows precise control over the receptive field's width and height, enabling
the capture of both local details and long-range dependencies, even with small
1x1 kernels. By decoupling the receptive field's shape from the kernel's
structure, RAD-Conv combines the adaptability of attention mechanisms with the
efficiency of standard convolutions. This innovative design offers a practical
solution for building more expressive and efficient vision models, bridging the
gap between rigid convolutional architectures and computationally costly
attention-based methods.

Conclusion: CAGE框架在鲁棒性和几何细节恢复方面表现优异，具有强大的跨数据集泛化能力

Abstract: We present \textbf{CAGE} (\textit{Continuity-Aware edGE}) network, a
\textcolor{red}{robust} framework for reconstructing vector floorplans directly
from point-cloud density maps. Traditional corner-based polygon representations
are highly sensitive to noise and incomplete observations, often resulting in
fragmented or implausible layouts. Recent line grouping methods leverage
structural cues to improve robustness but still struggle to recover fine
geometric details. To address these limitations, we propose a \textit{native}
edge-centric formulation, modeling each wall segment as a directed,
geometrically continuous edge. This representation enables inference of
coherent floorplan structures, ensuring watertight, topologically valid room
boundaries while improving robustness and reducing artifacts. Towards this
design, we develop a dual-query transformer decoder that integrates perturbed
and latent queries within a denoising framework, which not only stabilizes
optimization but also accelerates convergence. Extensive experiments on
Structured3D and SceneCAD show that \textbf{CAGE} achieves state-of-the-art
performance, with F1 scores of 99.1\% (rooms), 91.7\% (corners), and 89.3\%
(angles). The method also demonstrates strong cross-dataset generalization,
underscoring the efficacy of our architectural innovations. Code and pretrained
models will be released upon acceptance.

Abstract: The development of multimodal models for pulmonary nodule diagnosis is
limited by the scarcity of labeled data and the tendency for these models to
overfit on the training distribution. In this work, we leverage self-supervised
learning from longitudinal and multimodal archives to address these challenges.
We curate an unlabeled set of patients with CT scans and linked electronic
health records from our home institution to power joint embedding predictive
architecture (JEPA) pretraining. After supervised finetuning, we show that our
approach outperforms an unregularized multimodal model and imaging-only model
in an internal cohort (ours: 0.91, multimodal: 0.88, imaging-only: 0.73 AUC),
but underperforms in an external cohort (ours: 0.72, imaging-only: 0.75 AUC).
We develop a synthetic environment that characterizes the context in which JEPA
may underperform. This work innovates an approach that leverages unlabeled
multimodal medical archives to improve predictive models and demonstrates its
advantages and limitations in pulmonary nodule diagnosis.

Abstract: Dataset distillation aims to synthesize a small dataset from a large dataset,
enabling the model trained on it to perform well on the original dataset. With
the blooming of large language models and multimodal large language models, the
importance of multimodal datasets, particularly image-text datasets, has grown
significantly. However, existing multimodal dataset distillation methods are
constrained by the Matching Training Trajectories algorithm, which
significantly increases the computing resource requirement, and takes days to
process the distillation. In this work, we introduce EDGE, a generative
distillation method for efficient multimodal dataset distillation.
Specifically, we identify two key challenges of distilling multimodal datasets
with generative models: 1) The lack of correlation between generated images and
captions. 2) The lack of diversity among generated samples. To address the
aforementioned issues, we propose a novel generative model training workflow
with a bi-directional contrastive loss and a diversity loss. Furthermore, we

TL;DR: OpenViGA是一个开源的自动驾驶场景视频生成系统，通过分析三个核心组件（图像标记器、世界模型、视频解码器），使用预训练开源模型和公开数据集构建，实现了可复现的实时视频生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有视频生成系统模型庞大、训练资源需求高、设计选择缺乏深入分析、代码和数据集不公开的问题。

Method: 基于预训练开源模型，使用BDD100K数据集进行微调，构建包含图像标记器、世界模型和视频解码器的三组件系统，并优化组件间接口。

Result: 在256x256分辨率、4fps条件下，仅需一帧算法延迟即可逐帧预测逼真的驾驶场景视频。

Conclusion: OpenViGA提供了一个完全可复现的开源视频生成解决方案，为自动驾驶场景的视频预测研究提供了透明且可访问的平台。

Abstract: Recent successful video generation systems that predict and create realistic
automotive driving scenes from short video inputs assign tokenization, future
state prediction (world model), and video decoding to dedicated models. These
approaches often utilize large models that require significant training
resources, offer limited insight into design choices, and lack publicly
available code and datasets. In this work, we address these deficiencies and
present OpenViGA, an open video generation system for automotive driving
scenes. Our contributions are: Unlike several earlier works for video
generation, such as GAIA-1, we provide a deep analysis of the three components
of our system by separate quantitative and qualitative evaluation: Image
tokenizer, world model, video decoder. Second, we purely build upon powerful
pre-trained open source models from various domains, which we fine-tune by
publicly available automotive data (BDD100K) on GPU hardware at academic scale.
Third, we build a coherent video generation system by streamlining interfaces
of our components. Fourth, due to public availability of the underlying models
and data, we allow full reproducibility. Finally, we also publish our code and
models on Github. For an image size of 256x256 at 4 fps we are able to predict
realistic driving scene videos frame-by-frame with only one frame of
algorithmic latency.

*Vaibhav Mishra,William Lotter*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文系统分析了6种计算病理学基础模型的表征空间结构，发现不同训练范式（视觉-语言对比学习vs自蒸馏）的模型表征结构差异显著，且所有模型都表现出高切片依赖性但低疾病依赖性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着基础模型在计算病理学中的快速发展，虽然已有研究评估了模型的任务性能，但对其学习表征的结构和变异性了解较少，需要系统分析这些模型的表征空间特征。

Method: 使用计算神经科学中的表征相似性分析技术，对6种CPath基础模型（CONCH、PLIP、KEEP、UNI2、Virchow2、Prov-GigaPath）在TCGA H&E图像补丁上的表征结构进行系统比较。

Result: UNI2和Virchow2具有最独特的表征结构，Prov-GigaPath具有最高的平均相似性；相同训练范式不保证更高的表征相似性；所有模型都表现出高切片依赖性但低疾病依赖性；染色标准化可降低切片依赖性5.5%-20.5%；视觉-语言模型表征更紧凑，视觉模型表征更分散。

Conclusion: 研究结果揭示了改进模型对切片特异性特征鲁棒性的机会，为模型集成策略提供信息，并深入理解训练范式如何塑造模型表征。该框架可扩展到其他医学影像领域，帮助确保基础模型的有效开发和部署。

Abstract: Foundation models are increasingly developed in computational pathology
(CPath) given their promise in facilitating many downstream tasks. While recent
studies have evaluated task performance across models, less is known about the
structure and variability of their learned representations. Here, we
systematically analyze the representational spaces of six CPath foundation
models using techniques popularized in computational neuroscience. The models
analyzed span vision-language contrastive learning (CONCH, PLIP, KEEP) and
self-distillation (UNI (v2), Virchow (v2), Prov-GigaPath) approaches. Through
representational similarity analysis using H&E image patches from TCGA, we find
that UNI2 and Virchow2 have the most distinct representational structures,
whereas Prov-Gigapath has the highest average similarity across models. Having
the same training paradigm (vision-only vs. vision-language) did not guarantee
higher representational similarity. The representations of all models showed a
high slide-dependence, but relatively low disease-dependence. Stain
normalization decreased slide-dependence for all models by a range of 5.5%
(CONCH) to 20.5% (PLIP). In terms of intrinsic dimensionality, vision-language
models demonstrated relatively compact representations, compared to the more
distributed representations of vision-only models. These findings highlight
opportunities to improve robustness to slide-specific features, inform model
ensembling strategies, and provide insights into how training paradigms shape
model representations. Our framework is extendable across medical imaging
domains, where probing the internal representations of foundation models can
help ensure effective development and deployment.

Conclusion: 研究表明，无需牺牲核心空间推理能力，就能在现实世界环境中实现高效、可部署的多模态智能。

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have enabled powerful
multimodal reasoning, but state-of-the-art approaches typically rely on
extremely large models with prohibitive computational and memory requirements.
This makes their deployment challenging in resource-constrained environments
such as warehouses, robotics, and industrial applications, where both
efficiency and robust spatial understanding are critical. In this work, we
present SmolRGPT, a compact vision-language architecture that explicitly
incorporates region-level spatial reasoning by integrating both RGB and depth
cues. SmolRGPT employs a three-stage curriculum that progressively align visual
and language features, enables spatial relationship understanding, and adapts
to task-specific datasets. We demonstrate that with only 600M parameters,
SmolRGPT achieves competitive results on challenging warehouse spatial
reasoning benchmarks, matching or exceeding the performance of much larger
alternatives. These findings highlight the potential for efficient, deployable
multimodal intelligence in real-world settings without sacrificing core spatial
reasoning capabilities. The code of the experimentation will be available at:

foundation model, Lynx introduces two lightweight adapters to ensure identity
fidelity. The ID-adapter employs a Perceiver Resampler to convert
ArcFace-derived facial embeddings into compact identity tokens for

preservation while maintaining temporal coherence and visual realism. Through
evaluation on a curated benchmark of 40 subjects and 20 unbiased prompts, which
yielded 800 test cases, Lynx has demonstrated superior face resemblance,
competitive prompt following, and strong video quality, thereby advancing the

Result: 实验表明该方法优于现有剪枝防御方法，在有限数据条件下保持强性能，与最先进的微调方法相比具有竞争力，特别在恢复受损样本的正确预测方面效果显著。

Conclusion: 该方法为后门防御提供了有效的剪枝解决方案，在可解释性和低数据鲁棒性方面具有优势，同时实现了与微调方法相竞争的性能。

Abstract: Model pruning has gained traction as a promising defense strategy against
backdoor attacks in deep learning. However, existing pruning-based approaches
often fall short in accurately identifying and removing the specific parameters
responsible for inducing backdoor behaviors. Despite the dominance of
fine-tuning-based defenses in recent literature, largely due to their superior
performance, pruning remains a compelling alternative, offering greater
interpretability and improved robustness in low-data regimes. In this paper, we
propose a novel pruning approach featuring a learned \emph{selection} mechanism
to identify parameters critical to both main and backdoor tasks, along with an
\emph{invertible} pruning mask designed to simultaneously achieve two
complementary goals: eliminating the backdoor task while preserving it through
the inverse mask. We formulate this as a bi-level optimization problem that
jointly learns selection variables, a sparse invertible mask, and
sample-specific backdoor perturbations derived from clean data. The inner
problem synthesizes candidate triggers using the inverse mask, while the outer
problem refines the mask to suppress backdoor behavior without impairing
clean-task accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach
outperforms existing pruning-based backdoor mitigation approaches, maintains
strong performance under limited data conditions, and achieves competitive
results compared to state-of-the-art fine-tuning approaches. Notably, the
proposed approach is particularly effective in restoring correct predictions
for compromised samples after successful backdoor mitigation.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的量化感知训练方法MEC-Quant，通过最大化编码熵来减少量化带来的表示偏差，在极低比特设置下实现了与全精度模型相当甚至更好的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前量化感知训练方法在性能上仍劣于全精度模型，作者认为量化不可避免地会引入表示偏差，特别是在极低比特设置下。

Method: 提出最大熵编码量化方法，利用有损数据编码中的最小编码长度作为熵的计算可处理替代，并基于混合专家模型推导出可扩展的目标函数重构。

Result: 在多种计算机视觉任务上的实验证明，MEC-Quant首次将QAT的极限推至x比特激活，其准确率可与甚至超过全精度模型。

Conclusion: MEC-Quant为QAT建立了新的最先进水平，无需额外技巧即可实现优异性能。

Abstract: Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) has driven much attention to produce
efficient neural networks. Current QAT still obtains inferior performances
compared with the Full Precision (FP) counterpart. In this work, we argue that
quantization inevitably introduce biases into the learned representation,
especially under the extremely low-bit setting. To cope with this issue, we
propose Maximum Entropy Coding Quantization (MEC-Quant), a more principled
objective that explicitly optimizes on the structure of the representation, so
that the learned representation is less biased and thus generalizes better to
unseen in-distribution samples. To make the objective end-to-end trainable, we
propose to leverage the minimal coding length in lossy data coding as a
computationally tractable surrogate for the entropy, and further derive a
scalable reformulation of the objective based on Mixture Of Experts (MOE) that
not only allows fast computation but also handles the long-tailed distribution
for weights or activation values. Extensive experiments on various tasks on
computer vision tasks prove its superiority. With MEC-Qaunt, the limit of QAT
is pushed to the x-bit activation for the first time and the accuracy of
MEC-Quant is comparable to or even surpass the FP counterpart. Without bells
and whistles, MEC-Qaunt establishes a new state of the art for QAT.

Motivation: 现有的GUI定位方法在处理高分辨率截图时难以实现细粒度定位，需要更有效的解决方案。

Method: 采用自适应多阶段推理框架，结合自适应区域感知(ARP)和自适应阶段控制(ASC)，通过两阶段训练流程（监督微调+基于GRPO的强化微调）实现动态视觉注意力裁剪和推理策略自适应。

Result: 在GUI定位基准测试中达到最先进性能，7B模型在ScreenSpot-Pro上达到60.8%准确率，在UI-Vision上达到30.9%，甚至能与72B开源模型竞争。

Conclusion: GUI-ARP框架有效解决了高分辨率GUI截图中的细粒度定位问题，展示了自适应多阶段推理策略的优越性。

Abstract: Existing GUI grounding methods often struggle with fine-grained localization
in high-resolution screenshots. To address this, we propose GUI-ARP, a novel
framework that enables adaptive multi-stage inference. Equipped with the
proposed Adaptive Region Perception (ARP) and Adaptive Stage Controlling (ASC),
GUI-ARP dynamically exploits visual attention for cropping task-relevant
regions and adapts its inference strategy, performing a single-stage inference
for simple cases and a multi-stage analysis for more complex scenarios. This is
achieved through a two-phase training pipeline that integrates supervised
fine-tuning with reinforcement fine-tuning based on Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO). Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed
GUI-ARP achieves state-of-the-art performance on challenging GUI grounding
benchmarks, with a 7B model reaching 60.8% accuracy on ScreenSpot-Pro and 30.9%
on UI-Vision benchmark. Notably, GUI-ARP-7B demonstrates strong competitiveness
against open-source 72B models (UI-TARS-72B at 38.1%) and proprietary models.

Conclusion: SAMPO能够泛化到未见任务，并从更大模型规模中受益，展示了良好的零样本泛化和缩放行为

Abstract: World models allow agents to simulate the consequences of actions in imagined
environments for planning, control, and long-horizon decision-making. However,
existing autoregressive world models struggle with visually coherent
predictions due to disrupted spatial structure, inefficient decoding, and
inadequate motion modeling. In response, we propose \textbf{S}cale-wise
\textbf{A}utoregression with \textbf{M}otion \textbf{P}r\textbf{O}mpt
(\textbf{SAMPO}), a hybrid framework that combines visual autoregressive
modeling for intra-frame generation with causal modeling for next-frame
generation. Specifically, SAMPO integrates temporal causal decoding with
bidirectional spatial attention, which preserves spatial locality and supports
parallel decoding within each scale. This design significantly enhances both
temporal consistency and rollout efficiency. To further improve dynamic scene
understanding, we devise an asymmetric multi-scale tokenizer that preserves
spatial details in observed frames and extracts compact dynamic representations
for future frames, optimizing both memory usage and model performance.
Additionally, we introduce a trajectory-aware motion prompt module that injects
spatiotemporal cues about object and robot trajectories, focusing attention on
dynamic regions and improving temporal consistency and physical realism.
Extensive experiments show that SAMPO achieves competitive performance in
action-conditioned video prediction and model-based control, improving
generation quality with 4.4$\times$ faster inference. We also evaluate SAMPO's
zero-shot generalization and scaling behavior, demonstrating its ability to
generalize to unseen tasks and benefit from larger model sizes.

Motivation: 现有情感分析方法主要关注语言线索而忽视图像作为补充的非语言线索，且针对人类欲望理解的多模态方法研究不足。

Method: 使用对称双向多模态学习框架，包括低分辨率图像获取全局视觉表示进行跨模态对齐，高分辨率图像分割为子图像并通过掩码图像建模捕捉细粒度局部特征，引入文本引导图像解码器和图像引导文本解码器促进深度跨模态交互。

Result: 在MSED数据集上，该方法在欲望理解、情感识别和情绪分析三个任务上分别实现了1.1%、0.6%和0.9%的F1分数提升，优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: 提出的对称双向多模态学习框架有效提升了欲望、情感和情绪识别的性能，验证了文本和图像模态相互引导策略的有效性。

Abstract: Desire, as an intention that drives human behavior, is closely related to
both emotion and sentiment. Multimodal learning has advanced sentiment and
emotion recognition, but multimodal approaches specially targeting human desire
understanding remain underexplored. And existing methods in sentiment analysis
predominantly emphasize verbal cues and overlook images as complementary
non-verbal cues. To address these gaps, we propose a Symmetrical Bidirectional
Multimodal Learning Framework for Desire, Emotion, and Sentiment Recognition,
which enforces mutual guidance between text and image modalities to effectively
capture intention-related representations in the image. Specifically,
low-resolution images are used to obtain global visual representations for
cross-modal alignment, while high resolution images are partitioned into
sub-images and modeled with masked image modeling to enhance the ability to
capture fine-grained local features. A text-guided image decoder and an
image-guided text decoder are introduced to facilitate deep cross-modal
interaction at both local and global representations of image information.
Additionally, to balance perceptual gains with computation cost, a mixed-scale
image strategy is adopted, where high-resolution images are cropped into
sub-images for masked modeling. The proposed approach is evaluated on MSED, a
multimodal dataset that includes a desire understanding benchmark, as well as
emotion and sentiment recognition. Experimental results indicate consistent
improvements over other state-of-the-art methods, validating the effectiveness
of our proposed method. Specifically, our method outperforms existing
approaches, achieving F1-score improvements of 1.1% in desire understanding,
0.6% in emotion recognition, and 0.9% in sentiment analysis. Our code is

Motivation: 现有的Sa2VA方法虽然结合了LLM和SAM~2，但在RVOS任务中仍存在误报问题，需要更精确的视频语言对齐验证

Method: 引入两个关键组件：1）视频语言检查器，显式验证查询中的主体和动作是否真实出现在视频中；2）关键帧采样器，自适应选择信息丰富的帧来捕捉早期对象出现和长期时间上下文

Result: 在MeViS测试集上达到64.14%的J&F分数，在ICCV 2025第7届LSVOS挑战赛的RVOS赛道中排名第2

Conclusion: 提出的训练免费框架有效提升了RVOS性能，通过显式验证和自适应采样解决了现有方法的局限性

Abstract: Referential Video Object Segmentation (RVOS) aims to segment all objects in a
video that match a given natural language description, bridging the gap between
vision and language understanding. Recent work, such as Sa2VA, combines Large
Language Models (LLMs) with SAM~2, leveraging the strong video reasoning
capability of LLMs to guide video segmentation. In this work, we present a
training-free framework that substantially improves Sa2VA's performance on the
RVOS task. Our method introduces two key components: (1) a Video-Language
Checker that explicitly verifies whether the subject and action described in
the query actually appear in the video, thereby reducing false positives; and
(2) a Key-Frame Sampler that adaptively selects informative frames to better
capture both early object appearances and long-range temporal context. Without
any additional training, our approach achieves a J&F score of 64.14% on the
MeViS test set, ranking 2nd place in the RVOS track of the 7th LSVOS Challenge
at ICCV 2025.

Conclusion: MS-GS通过有效的几何先验利用和多视图约束，成功解决了稀疏多外观场景下的3D重建问题，为真实世界应用提供了更可靠的基准。

Abstract: In-the-wild photo collections often contain limited volumes of imagery and
exhibit multiple appearances, e.g., taken at different times of day or seasons,
posing significant challenges to scene reconstruction and novel view synthesis.
Although recent adaptations of Neural Radiance Field (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS) have improved in these areas, they tend to oversmooth and are
prone to overfitting. In this paper, we present MS-GS, a novel framework
designed with Multi-appearance capabilities in Sparse-view scenarios using
3DGS. To address the lack of support due to sparse initializations, our
approach is built on the geometric priors elicited from monocular depth
estimations. The key lies in extracting and utilizing local semantic regions
with a Structure-from-Motion (SfM) points anchored algorithm for reliable
alignment and geometry cues. Then, to introduce multi-view constraints, we
propose a series of geometry-guided supervision at virtual views in a
fine-grained and coarse scheme to encourage 3D consistency and reduce
overfitting. We also introduce a dataset and an in-the-wild experiment setting
to set up more realistic benchmarks. We demonstrate that MS-GS achieves
photorealistic renderings under various challenging sparse-view and
multi-appearance conditions and outperforms existing approaches significantly
across different datasets.

Motivation: 多标签分类需要能够捕捉多标签交互的强大表示，而扩散Transformer模型中的中间特征可能包含丰富的语义信息。

Method: 从预训练扩散Transformer模型中提取图像和文本的中间特征，设计启发式局部搜索算法找到最优的"图像-文本"×"块-时间步"对，通过简单的融合线性投影和加法操作融合特征。

Result: 在MS-COCO-enhanced上达到98.6% mAP，在Visual Genome 500上达到45.7% mAP，显著超越CNN、图和Transformer基线模型，t-SNE和聚类指标显示Diff-Feat形成更紧密的语义簇。

Conclusion: 扩散Transformer模型的中间特征是多标签分类的强大表示，特定层（如Layer 12）和时间步的特征组合能获得最优性能，Diff-Feat框架简单有效且性能卓越。

Abstract: Multi-label classification has broad applications and depends on powerful
representations capable of capturing multi-label interactions. We introduce
\textit{Diff-Feat}, a simple but powerful framework that extracts intermediate
features from pre-trained diffusion-Transformer models for images and text, and
fuses them for downstream tasks. We observe that for vision tasks, the most
discriminative intermediate feature along the diffusion process occurs at the
middle step and is located in the middle block in Transformer. In contrast, for
language tasks, the best feature occurs at the noise-free step and is located
in the deepest block. In particular, we observe a striking phenomenon across
varying datasets: a mysterious "Layer $12$" consistently yields the best
performance on various downstream classification tasks for images (under
DiT-XL/2-256$\times$256). We devise a heuristic local-search algorithm that
pinpoints the locally optimal "image-text"$\times$"block-timestep" pair among a
few candidates, avoiding an exhaustive grid search. A simple fusion-linear
projection followed by addition-of the selected representations yields
state-of-the-art performance: 98.6\% mAP on MS-COCO-enhanced and 45.7\% mAP on
Visual Genome 500, surpassing strong CNN, graph, and Transformer baselines by a
wide margin. t-SNE and clustering metrics further reveal that
\textit{Diff-Feat} forms tighter semantic clusters than unimodal counterparts.

Abstract: Vision- and hearing-threatening diseases cause preventable disability,
especially in resource-constrained settings(RCS) with few specialists and
limited screening setup. Large scale AI-assisted screening and telehealth has
potential to expand early detection, but practical deployment is challenging in
paper-based workflows and limited documented field experience exist to build
upon. We provide insights on challenges and ways forward in development to
adoption of scalable AI-assisted Telehealth and screening in such settings.
Specifically, we find that iterative, interdisciplinary collaboration through
early prototyping, shadow deployment and continuous feedback is important to
build shared understanding as well as reduce usability hurdles when
transitioning from paper-based to AI-ready workflows. We find public datasets
and AI models highly useful despite poor performance due to domain shift. In
addition, we find the need for automated AI-based image quality check to
capture gradable images for robust screening in high-volume camps.
  Our field learning stress the importance of treating AI development and
workflow digitization as an end-to-end, iterative co-design process. By
documenting these practical challenges and lessons learned, we aim to address
the gap in contextual, actionable field knowledge for building real-world
AI-assisted telehealth and mass-screening programs in RCS.

### [40] [DC-Mamba: Bi-temporal deformable alignment and scale-sparse enhancement for remote sensing change detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15563)
*Min Sun,Fenghui Guo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DC-Mamba是一个基于ChangeMamba的"先对齐后增强"框架，通过两个轻量级模块解决遥感变化检测中的几何错位和噪声问题，显著提升了检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有遥感变化检测方法（包括最先进的SSM模型）缺乏明确的几何错位处理机制，难以区分真实变化和噪声，特别是对于细微变化。

Method: 提出DC-Mamba框架，包含两个模块：1）双时相可变形对齐（BTDA）在语义特征层面纠正空间错位；2）尺度稀疏变化放大器（SSCA）利用多源线索选择性放大高置信度变化信号并抑制噪声。

Result: 实验表明该方法显著优于ChangeMamba基线，F1分数从0.5730提升到0.5903，IoU从0.4015提升到0.4187。

Conclusion: "先对齐后增强"策略有效解决了遥感变化检测中的几何和特征层面挑战，提供了一个鲁棒且易于部署的解决方案。

Abstract: Remote sensing change detection (RSCD) is vital for identifying land-cover
changes, yet existing methods, including state-of-the-art State Space Models
(SSMs), often lack explicit mechanisms to handle geometric misalignments and
struggle to distinguish subtle, true changes from noise.To address this, we
introduce DC-Mamba, an "align-then-enhance" framework built upon the
ChangeMamba backbone. It integrates two lightweight, plug-and-play modules: (1)
Bi-Temporal Deformable Alignment (BTDA), which explicitly introduces geometric
awareness to correct spatial misalignments at the semantic feature level; and
(2) a Scale-Sparse Change Amplifier(SSCA), which uses multi-source cues to
selectively amplify high-confidence change signals while suppressing noise
before the final classification. This synergistic design first establishes
geometric consistency with BTDA to reduce pseudo-changes, then leverages SSCA
to sharpen boundaries and enhance the visibility of small or subtle targets.
Experiments show our method significantly improves performance over the strong
ChangeMamba baseline, increasing the F1-score from 0.5730 to 0.5903 and IoU
from 0.4015 to 0.4187. The results confirm the effectiveness of our
"align-then-enhance" strategy, offering a robust and easily deployable solution
that transparently addresses both geometric and feature-level challenges in
RSCD.

TL;DR: 提出Blink-Think-Link（BTL）框架，模仿人类认知过程进行GUI交互，通过三个生物启发阶段实现更自然的人机交互


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI驱动的GUI交互自动化方法虽然取得显著进展，但其交互逻辑与自然的人类-GUI通信模式存在显著偏差

Method: BTL框架将交互分解为三个生物合理阶段：Blink（快速检测和注意力）、Think（高级推理和决策）、Link（生成可执行命令），并引入Blink数据生成和BTL奖励两个关键技术创新

Result: 基于BTL框架开发的BTL-UI代理模型在综合基准测试中，在静态GUI理解和动态交互任务上都展现出最先进的性能

Conclusion: 实验结果提供了框架有效性的经验验证，为开发高级GUI代理提供了有效途径

Abstract: In the field of AI-driven human-GUI interaction automation, while rapid
advances in multimodal large language models and reinforcement fine-tuning
techniques have yielded remarkable progress, a fundamental challenge persists:
their interaction logic significantly deviates from natural human-GUI
communication patterns. To fill this gap, we propose "Blink-Think-Link" (BTL),
a brain-inspired framework for human-GUI interaction that mimics the human
cognitive process between users and graphical interfaces. The system decomposes
interactions into three biologically plausible phases: (1) Blink - rapid
detection and attention to relevant screen areas, analogous to saccadic eye
movements; (2) Think - higher-level reasoning and decision-making, mirroring
cognitive planning; and (3) Link - generation of executable commands for
precise motor control, emulating human action selection mechanisms.
Additionally, we introduce two key technical innovations for the BTL framework:
(1) Blink Data Generation - an automated annotation pipeline specifically
optimized for blink data, and (2) BTL Reward -- the first rule-based reward
mechanism that enables reinforcement learning driven by both process and
outcome. Building upon this framework, we develop a GUI agent model named
BTL-UI, which demonstrates consistent state-of-the-art performance across both
static GUI understanding and dynamic interaction tasks in comprehensive
benchmarks. These results provide conclusive empirical validation of the
framework's efficacy in developing advanced GUI Agents.

Main category: cs.CV

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有显著目标检测评估指标存在对目标大小的敏感性，当图像中出现尺寸差异显著的多个显著目标时，评估结果会被大尺寸区域主导，导致对小而重要的目标的评估偏差。

Method: 通过理论推导将评估结果分解为可分离项，提出SIEva框架对每个组件单独评估后聚合结果；开发模型无关的SIOpt优化框架，基于大小不变原则增强多尺度目标检测能力。

Result: 理论分析支持新评估协议的有效性，实验验证了所提方法的有效性，能够显著改善不同尺寸显著目标的检测性能。

Conclusion: 提出的大小不变评估和优化框架有效解决了显著目标检测中的尺寸敏感性偏差问题，为多尺度显著目标检测提供了更公平的评估标准和性能提升方案。

Abstract: This paper investigates a fundamental yet underexplored issue in Salient
Object Detection (SOD): the size-invariant property for evaluation protocols,
particularly in scenarios when multiple salient objects of significantly
different sizes appear within a single image. We first present a novel
perspective to expose the inherent size sensitivity of existing widely used SOD
metrics. Through careful theoretical derivations, we show that the evaluation
outcome of an image under current SOD metrics can be essentially decomposed
into a sum of several separable terms, with the contribution of each term being
directly proportional to its corresponding region size. Consequently, the
prediction errors would be dominated by the larger regions, while smaller yet
potentially more semantically important objects are often overlooked, leading
to biased performance assessments and practical degradation. To address this
challenge, a generic Size-Invariant Evaluation (SIEva) framework is proposed.
The core idea is to evaluate each separable component individually and then
aggregate the results, thereby effectively mitigating the impact of size
imbalance across objects. Building upon this, we further develop a dedicated
optimization framework (SIOpt), which adheres to the size-invariant principle
and significantly enhances the detection of salient objects across a broad
range of sizes. Notably, SIOpt is model-agnostic and can be seamlessly
integrated with a wide range of SOD backbones. Theoretically, we also present
generalization analysis of SOD methods and provide evidence supporting the
validity of our new evaluation protocols. Finally, comprehensive experiments
speak to the efficacy of our proposed approach. The code is available at
https://github.com/Ferry-Li/SI-SOD.

Conclusion: 该工作为短视频平台假新闻检测提供了稳健解决方案，为打击错误信息开辟了更可靠全面的方法

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of short video platforms has necessitated advanced
methods for detecting fake news. This need arises from the widespread influence
and ease of sharing misinformation, which can lead to significant societal
harm. Current methods often struggle with the dynamic and multimodal nature of
short video content. This paper presents HFN, Heterogeneous Fusion Net, a novel
multimodal framework that integrates video, audio, and text data to evaluate
the authenticity of short video content. HFN introduces a Decision Network that
dynamically adjusts modality weights during inference and a Weighted
Multi-Modal Feature Fusion module to ensure robust performance even with
incomplete data. Additionally, we contribute a comprehensive dataset VESV
(VEracity on Short Videos) specifically designed for short video fake news
detection. Experiments conducted on the FakeTT and newly collected VESV
datasets demonstrate improvements of 2.71% and 4.14% in Marco F1 over
state-of-the-art methods. This work establishes a robust solution capable of
effectively identifying fake news in the complex landscape of short video
platforms, paving the way for more reliable and comprehensive approaches in

Conclusion: EyePCR揭示了现有MLLM在外科认知方面的局限性，为评估和提升手术视频理解模型的临床可靠性奠定了基础。

Abstract: MLLMs (Multimodal Large Language Models) have showcased remarkable
capabilities, but their performance in high-stakes, domain-specific scenarios
like surgical settings, remains largely under-explored. To address this gap, we
develop \textbf{EyePCR}, a large-scale benchmark for ophthalmic surgery
analysis, grounded in structured clinical knowledge to evaluate cognition
across \textit{Perception}, \textit{Comprehension} and \textit{Reasoning}.
EyePCR offers a richly annotated corpus with more than 210k VQAs, which cover
1048 fine-grained attributes for multi-view perception, medical knowledge graph
of more than 25k triplets for comprehension, and four clinically grounded
reasoning tasks. The rich annotations facilitate in-depth cognitive analysis,
simulating how surgeons perceive visual cues and combine them with domain
knowledge to make decisions, thus greatly improving models' cognitive ability.
In particular, \textbf{EyePCR-MLLM}, a domain-adapted variant of Qwen2.5-VL-7B,
achieves the highest accuracy on MCQs for \textit{Perception} among compared
models and outperforms open-source models in \textit{Comprehension} and
\textit{Reasoning}, rivalling commercial models like GPT-4.1. EyePCR reveals
the limitations of existing MLLMs in surgical cognition and lays the foundation
for benchmarking and enhancing clinical reliability of surgical video

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在一般视频理解方面表现出色，但在处理像网球这样的快速、高频运动时存在困难，因为回合片段短但信息密集。

Method: 将每个网球回合建模为时间顺序的连续击球事件序列，使用自动化流程进行筛选和问题生成，涵盖8个任务级别，包含2500个人工验证的问题。

Result: 评估了16个代表性MLLM，揭示了模型在网球视频理解方面的显著不足，并发现两个关键见解：帧采样密度应根据任务进行定制和平衡，改进时间定位对于更强推理至关重要。

Conclusion: TennisTV基准为网球视频理解提供了系统评估，揭示了当前MLLM在该领域的局限性，并提出了改进方向。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) excel at general video understanding
but struggle with fast, high-frequency sports like tennis, where rally clips
are short yet information-dense. To systematically evaluate MLLMs in this
challenging domain, we present TennisTV, the first and most comprehensive
benchmark for tennis video understanding. TennisTV models each rally as a
temporal-ordered sequence of consecutive stroke events, using automated
pipelines for filtering and question generation. It covers 8 tasks at rally and
stroke levels and includes 2,500 human-verified questions. Evaluating 16
representative MLLMs, we provide the first systematic assessment of tennis
video understanding. Results reveal substantial shortcomings and yield two key
insights: (i) frame-sampling density should be tailored and balanced across
tasks, and (ii) improving temporal grounding is essential for stronger
reasoning.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Rasa框架，利用病理报告辅助全切片图像进行生存分析，通过LLM提取文本特征，自蒸馏过滤冗余特征，风险感知混合增强数据多样性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统WSI生存分析面临噪声特征和数据限制问题，病理报告包含丰富信息但未被充分利用来增强WSI分析

Method: 1) 使用LLM从病理报告中提取细粒度文本描述；2) 设计自蒸馏管道过滤无关WSI特征；3) 风险感知混合策略增强训练数据

Result: 在CRC和TCGA-BRCA数据集上的实验表明Rasa优于现有最先进方法

Conclusion: Rasa框架有效整合病理报告信息，显著提升WSI生存分析性能

Abstract: Survival analysis based on Whole Slide Images (WSIs) is crucial for
evaluating cancer prognosis, as they offer detailed microscopic information
essential for predicting patient outcomes. However, traditional WSI-based
survival analysis usually faces noisy features and limited data accessibility,
hindering their ability to capture critical prognostic features effectively.
Although pathology reports provide rich patient-specific information that could
assist analysis, their potential to enhance WSI-based survival analysis remains
largely unexplored. To this end, this paper proposes a novel Report-auxiliary
self-distillation (Rasa) framework for WSI-based survival analysis. First,
advanced large language models (LLMs) are utilized to extract fine-grained,
WSI-relevant textual descriptions from original noisy pathology reports via a
carefully designed task prompt. Next, a self-distillation-based pipeline is
designed to filter out irrelevant or redundant WSI features for the student
model under the guidance of the teacher model's textual knowledge. Finally, a
risk-aware mix-up strategy is incorporated during the training of the student
model to enhance both the quantity and diversity of the training data.
Extensive experiments carried out on our collected data (CRC) and public data
(TCGA-BRCA) demonstrate the superior effectiveness of Rasa against
state-of-the-art methods. Our code is available at

TL;DR: 本文提出PCSR框架，通过伪标签一致性指导样本细化，解决跨模态检索中噪声对应问题，提升检索鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法假设图像-文本对完美对齐，忽略了真实数据中的噪声对应关系。这些错配对会误导相似性学习并降低检索性能。

Method: 使用置信度估计区分干净和噪声对，通过伪标签一致性细化噪声对，提出PCS评分量化预测稳定性，采用自适应对优化策略。

Result: 在CC152K、MS-COCO和Flickr30K数据集上的实验验证了该方法在噪声监督下提升检索鲁棒性的有效性。

Conclusion: PCSR框架通过细粒度样本划分和自适应优化策略，有效处理跨模态检索中的噪声对应问题。

Abstract: Cross-modal retrieval aims to align different modalities via semantic
similarity. However, existing methods often assume that image-text pairs are
perfectly aligned, overlooking Noisy Correspondences in real data. These
misaligned pairs misguide similarity learning and degrade retrieval
performance. Previous methods often rely on coarse-grained categorizations that
simply divide data into clean and noisy samples, overlooking the intrinsic
diversity within noisy instances. Moreover, they typically apply uniform
training strategies regardless of sample characteristics, resulting in
suboptimal sample utilization for model optimization. To address the above
challenges, we introduce a novel framework, called Pseudo-label
Consistency-Guided Sample Refinement (PCSR), which enhances correspondence
reliability by explicitly dividing samples based on pseudo-label consistency.
Specifically, we first employ a confidence-based estimation to distinguish
clean and noisy pairs, then refine the noisy pairs via pseudo-label consistency
to uncover structurally distinct subsets. We further proposed a Pseudo-label
Consistency Score (PCS) to quantify prediction stability, enabling the
separation of ambiguous and refinable samples within noisy pairs. Accordingly,
we adopt Adaptive Pair Optimization (APO), where ambiguous samples are
optimized with robust loss functions and refinable ones are enhanced via text
replacement during training. Extensive experiments on CC152K, MS-COCO and
Flickr30K validate the effectiveness of our method in improving retrieval
robustness under noisy supervision.

TL;DR: 提出了首个针对医学图像分割中异构数据场景的个性化联邦SAM框架，通过参数聚合和知识蒸馏技术解决联邦学习中SAM大编码器的挑战


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像分割对计算机辅助诊断至关重要，但隐私限制阻碍了机构间数据共享。联邦学习解决了这一限制，但现有方法在处理复杂异构数据时表现不佳。SAM模型具有出色的分割能力，但其大编码器在联邦设置中面临挑战

Method: 1）个性化策略：仅聚合全局参数以捕捉跨客户端共性，同时保留设计的L-MoE组件以保护领域特定特征；2）解耦的全局-局部微调机制：通过知识蒸馏的师生范式弥合全局共享模型与个性化局部模型之间的差距

Result: 在两个公共数据集上的广泛实验验证了该方法显著提高了分割性能，实现了鲁棒的跨域适应，并减少了通信开销

Conclusion: 该框架为医学图像分割中的异构数据联邦学习提供了有效的解决方案，平衡了模型性能与隐私保护需求

Abstract: Medical image segmentation is crucial for computer-aided diagnosis, yet
privacy constraints hinder data sharing across institutions. Federated learning
addresses this limitation, but existing approaches often rely on lightweight
architectures that struggle with complex, heterogeneous data. Recently, the
Segment Anything Model (SAM) has shown outstanding segmentation capabilities;
however, its massive encoder poses significant challenges in federated
settings. In this work, we present the first personalized federated SAM
framework tailored for heterogeneous data scenarios in medical image
segmentation. Our framework integrates two key innovations: (1) a personalized
strategy that aggregates only the global parameters to capture cross-client
commonalities while retaining the designed L-MoE (Localized Mixture-of-Experts)
component to preserve domain-specific features; and (2) a decoupled
global-local fine-tuning mechanism that leverages a teacher-student paradigm
via knowledge distillation to bridge the gap between the global shared model
and the personalized local models, thereby mitigating overgeneralization.
Extensive experiments on two public datasets validate that our approach
significantly improves segmentation performance, achieves robust cross-domain
adaptation, and reduces communication overhead.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决RGB-可见光和红外传感器在自动驾驶等多模态场景中性能不佳的问题，需要开发能够同时处理两种模态的统一模型。

Method: 1. Patch-wise Cross-modality Contrastive Learning (PCCL)：注意力引导的蒸馏框架，模拟视网膜水平细胞的侧抑制机制；2. 双知识保留机制：结合LoRA适配器和同步蒸馏，防止灾难性遗忘。

Conclusion: UNIV模型成功实现了RGB和红外模态的有效统一，为多模态感知提供了生物学启发的解决方案，并在MVIP数据集上验证了其优越性。

Abstract: The demand for joint RGB-visible and infrared perception is growing rapidly,
particularly to achieve robust performance under diverse weather conditions.
Although pre-trained models for RGB-visible and infrared data excel in their
respective domains, they often underperform in multimodal scenarios, such as
autonomous vehicles equipped with both sensors. To address this challenge, we
propose a biologically inspired UNified foundation model for Infrared and
Visible modalities (UNIV), featuring two key innovations. First, we introduce
Patch-wise Cross-modality Contrastive Learning (PCCL), an attention-guided
distillation framework that mimics retinal horizontal cells' lateral
inhibition, which enables effective cross-modal feature alignment while
remaining compatible with any transformer-based architecture. Second, our
dual-knowledge preservation mechanism emulates the retina's bipolar cell signal
routing - combining LoRA adapters (2% added parameters) with synchronous
distillation to prevent catastrophic forgetting, thereby replicating the
retina's photopic (cone-driven) and scotopic (rod-driven) functionality. To
support cross-modal learning, we introduce the MVIP dataset, the most
comprehensive visible-infrared benchmark to date. It contains 98,992 precisely
aligned image pairs spanning diverse scenarios. Extensive experiments
demonstrate UNIV's superior performance on infrared tasks (+1.7 mIoU in
semantic segmentation and +0.7 mAP in object detection) while maintaining 99%+
of the baseline performance on visible RGB tasks. Our code is available at

TL;DR: GS-Scale是一个针对3D高斯泼溅技术的内存高效训练系统，通过将高斯数据存储在主机内存中并按需传输到GPU，显著降低GPU内存需求3.3-5.6倍，同时保持训练速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D高斯泼溅技术虽然能提供高质量渲染和快速渲染速度，但在大规模场景的高质量训练中面临GPU内存不足的挑战，因为需要存储参数、梯度和优化器状态。

Method: GS-Scale采用三项系统级优化：(1)选择性卸载几何参数以加速视锥剔除；(2)参数前向传递将CPU优化器更新与GPU计算流水线化；(3)延迟优化器更新以减少零梯度高斯的不必要内存访问。

Result: 在大型数据集上的评估显示，GS-Scale能将高斯数量从400万扩展到1800万（在RTX 4070移动GPU上），并带来23-35%的LPIPS（学习感知图像块相似度）改进。

Conclusion: GS-Scale使大规模3D高斯泼溅训练能够在消费级GPU上实现，解决了内存限制问题，同时保持了训练效率。

Abstract: The advent of 3D Gaussian Splatting has revolutionized graphics rendering by
delivering high visual quality and fast rendering speeds. However, training
large-scale scenes at high quality remains challenging due to the substantial
memory demands required to store parameters, gradients, and optimizer states,
which can quickly overwhelm GPU memory. To address these limitations, we
propose GS-Scale, a fast and memory-efficient training system for 3D Gaussian
Splatting. GS-Scale stores all Gaussians in host memory, transferring only a
subset to the GPU on demand for each forward and backward pass. While this
dramatically reduces GPU memory usage, it requires frustum culling and
optimizer updates to be executed on the CPU, introducing slowdowns due to CPU's
limited compute and memory bandwidth. To mitigate this, GS-Scale employs three
system-level optimizations: (1) selective offloading of geometric parameters
for fast frustum culling, (2) parameter forwarding to pipeline CPU optimizer
updates with GPU computation, and (3) deferred optimizer update to minimize
unnecessary memory accesses for Gaussians with zero gradients. Our extensive
evaluations on large-scale datasets demonstrate that GS-Scale significantly
lowers GPU memory demands by 3.3-5.6x, while achieving training speeds
comparable to GPU without host offloading. This enables large-scale 3D Gaussian
Splatting training on consumer-grade GPUs; for instance, GS-Scale can scale the
number of Gaussians from 4 million to 18 million on an RTX 4070 Mobile GPU,
leading to 23-35% LPIPS (learned perceptual image patch similarity)
improvement.

Abstract: Researchers have conducted many pioneer researches on contactless
fingerprints, yet the performance of contactless fingerprint recognition still
lags behind contact-based methods primary due to the insufficient contactless
fingerprint data with pose variations and lack of the usage of implicit 3D
fingerprint representations. In this paper, we introduce a novel contactless
fingerprint 3D registration, reconstruction and generation framework by
integrating 3D Gaussian Splatting, with the goal of offering a new paradigm for
contactless fingerprint recognition that integrates 3D fingerprint
reconstruction and generation. To our knowledge, this is the first work to
apply 3D Gaussian Splatting to the field of fingerprint recognition, and the
first to achieve effective 3D registration and complete reconstruction of
contactless fingerprints with sparse input images and without requiring camera
parameters information. Experiments on 3D fingerprint registration,
reconstruction, and generation prove that our method can accurately align and
reconstruct 3D fingerprints from 2D images, and sequentially generates
high-quality contactless fingerprints from 3D model, thus increasing the
performances for contactless fingerprint recognition.

Abstract: Point cloud data represents a crucial category of information for
mathematical modeling, and surface reconstruction from such data is an
important task across various disciplines. However, during the scanning
process, the collected point cloud data may fail to cover the entire surface
due to factors such as high light-absorption rate and occlusions, resulting in
incomplete datasets. Inferring surface structures in data-missing regions and
successfully reconstructing the surface poses a challenge. In this paper, we
present a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) based model for surface
reconstruction from incomplete point cloud data. Initially, we employ PCA to
estimate the normal information of the underlying surface from the available
point cloud data. This estimated normal information serves as a regularizer in
our model, guiding the reconstruction of the surface, particularly in areas
with missing data. Additionally, we introduce an operator-splitting method to
effectively solve the proposed model. Through systematic experimentation, we
demonstrate that our model successfully infers surface structures in
data-missing regions and well reconstructs the underlying surfaces,
outperforming existing methodologies.

*Gahye Lee,Hyomin Kim,Gwangjin Ju,Jooeun Son,Hyejeong Yoon,Seungyong Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Camera Splatting是一种新颖的视图优化框架，通过将相机建模为3D高斯分布（相机splat），在表面附近放置虚拟相机来观察相机splat的分布，实现视图优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决复杂视角相关现象（如强烈金属反射和复杂纹理）的捕捉问题，改进现有的最远视图采样方法。

Method: 将每个相机建模为3D高斯分布（相机splat），在表面附近采样3D点放置虚拟相机（点相机），通过可微分地优化相机splat来实现视图优化。

Result: 相比Farthest View Sampling方法，Camera Splatting在捕捉复杂视角相关现象方面表现出更优越的性能。

Conclusion: Camera Splatting提供了一种有效的视图优化方法，特别适用于处理复杂的视角相关效果。

Abstract: We propose Camera Splatting, a novel view optimization framework for novel
view synthesis. Each camera is modeled as a 3D Gaussian, referred to as a
camera splat, and virtual cameras, termed point cameras, are placed at 3D
points sampled near the surface to observe the distribution of camera splats.
View optimization is achieved by continuously and differentiably refining the
camera splats so that desirable target distributions are observed from the
point cameras, in a manner similar to the original 3D Gaussian splatting.
Compared to the Farthest View Sampling (FVS) approach, our optimized views
demonstrate superior performance in capturing complex view-dependent phenomena,
including intense metallic reflections and intricate textures such as text.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于条件扩散模型的手写笔画生成方法，通过多尺度注意力特征和词间距布局来模仿书法风格，相比现有方法在笔画生成方面表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有手写笔画生成方法在模仿书法风格时未考虑词间距（词布局）这一重要特征，导致风格模仿不一致。需要开发能够同时考虑局部和全局风格特征的方法。

Method: 提出多尺度注意力特征来捕捉局部和全局风格特征；引入词布局信息以控制词间距；采用条件扩散模型进行笔画生成而非直接生成风格图像，从而获得时间坐标信息。

Result: 实验表明，提出的扩散模型在笔画生成方面优于当前最先进的方法，并与最近的图像生成网络具有竞争力。

Conclusion: 结合多尺度风格特征和词布局信息的条件扩散模型能够有效模仿书法风格并生成高质量的手写笔画，为手写识别和书写者顺序恢复等任务提供了更好的基础。

Abstract: Handwriting stroke generation is crucial for improving the performance of
tasks such as handwriting recognition and writers order recovery. In
handwriting stroke generation, it is significantly important to imitate the
sample calligraphic style. The previous studies have suggested utilizing the
calligraphic features of the handwriting. However, they had not considered word
spacing (word layout) as an explicit handwriting feature, which results in
inconsistent word spacing for style imitation. Firstly, this work proposes
multi-scale attention features for calligraphic style imitation. These
multi-scale feature embeddings highlight the local and global style features.
Secondly, we propose to include the words layout, which facilitates word
spacing for handwriting stroke generation. Moreover, we propose a conditional
diffusion model to predict strokes in contrast to previous work, which directly
generated style images. Stroke generation provides additional temporal
coordinate information, which is lacking in image generation. Hence, our
proposed conditional diffusion model for stroke generation is guided by
calligraphic style and word layout for better handwriting imitation and stroke
generation in a calligraphic style. Our experimentation shows that the proposed
diffusion model outperforms the current state-of-the-art stroke generation and
is competitive with recent image generation networks.

*Johann Schmidt,Sebastian Stober,Joachim Denzler,Paul Bodesheim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种受人类扫视视觉启发的两阶段细粒度视觉分类方法，通过外围特征提取和注视点采样来克服传统基于部件方法的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于部件的方法依赖复杂的定位网络，存在空间冗余问题且难以确定最优部件数量，需要更有效的特征提取策略。

Method: 采用两阶段过程：先提取外围特征生成采样图，然后使用权重共享编码器并行编码注视点补丁，结合上下文选择性注意力融合外围和聚焦表示，并使用非极大值抑制消除冗余。

Result: 在标准FGVC基准测试和具有挑战性的昆虫数据集上，该方法达到了与最先进方法相当的性能，并始终优于基线编码器。

Conclusion: 该方法通过模拟人类视觉机制有效解决了细粒度分类中的空间冗余问题，为基于部件的分类提供了新思路。

Abstract: Fine-grained visual classification (FGVC) requires distinguishing between
visually similar categories through subtle, localized features - a task that
remains challenging due to high intra-class variability and limited inter-class
differences. Existing part-based methods often rely on complex localization
networks that learn mappings from pixel to sample space, requiring a deep
understanding of image content while limiting feature utility for downstream
tasks. In addition, sampled points frequently suffer from high spatial
redundancy, making it difficult to quantify the optimal number of required
parts. Inspired by human saccadic vision, we propose a two-stage process that
first extracts peripheral features (coarse view) and generates a sample map,
from which fixation patches are sampled and encoded in parallel using a
weight-shared encoder. We employ contextualized selective attention to weigh
the impact of each fixation patch before fusing peripheral and focus
representations. To prevent spatial collapse - a common issue in part-based
methods - we utilize non-maximum suppression during fixation sampling to
eliminate redundancy. Comprehensive evaluation on standard FGVC benchmarks
(CUB-200-2011, NABirds, Food-101 and Stanford-Dogs) and challenging insect
datasets (EU-Moths, Ecuador-Moths and AMI-Moths) demonstrates that our method
achieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art approaches while
consistently outperforming our baseline encoder.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个基准数据集和基线框架，用于将多模态卫星观测转换为详细的3D云相结构，旨在改进数值天气预报中的云微物理参数化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 云相剖面对于数值天气预报至关重要，直接影响辐射传输和降水过程。当前需要将多模态卫星观测转化为可操作的云相剖面信息。

Method: 使用多模态卫星观测数据（地球静止卫星的可见光/热红外图像和星载激光雷达/雷达的垂直云相剖面），采用SGMAGNet模型进行3D云相结构预测，并与UNet变体和SegNet等基线模型进行比较。

Result: SGMAGNet在云相重建方面表现优异，特别是在复杂的多层和边界过渡区域，取得了精度0.922、召回率0.858、F1分数0.763和IoU 0.617的显著性能。

Conclusion: SGMAGNet在多模态卫星观测到3D云相结构的转换任务中显著优于其他基线模型，为改进数值天气预报的云微物理参数化提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Cloud phase profiles are critical for numerical weather prediction (NWP), as
they directly affect radiative transfer and precipitation processes. In this
study, we present a benchmark dataset and a baseline framework for transforming
multimodal satellite observations into detailed 3D cloud phase structures,
aiming toward operational cloud phase profile retrieval and future integration
with NWP systems to improve cloud microphysics parameterization. The multimodal
observations consist of (1) high--spatiotemporal--resolution, multi-band
visible (VIS) and thermal infrared (TIR) imagery from geostationary satellites,
and (2) accurate vertical cloud phase profiles from spaceborne lidar
(CALIOP\slash CALIPSO) and radar (CPR\slash CloudSat). The dataset consists of
synchronized image--profile pairs across diverse cloud regimes, defining a
supervised learning task: given VIS/TIR patches, predict the corresponding 3D
cloud phase structure. We adopt SGMAGNet as the main model and compare it with
several baseline architectures, including UNet variants and SegNet, all
designed to capture multi-scale spatial patterns. Model performance is
evaluated using standard classification metrics, including Precision, Recall,
F1-score, and IoU. The results demonstrate that SGMAGNet achieves superior
performance in cloud phase reconstruction, particularly in complex multi-layer
and boundary transition regions. Quantitatively, SGMAGNet attains a Precision
of 0.922, Recall of 0.858, F1-score of 0.763, and an IoU of 0.617,
significantly outperforming all baselines across these key metrics.

TL;DR: SceneForge是一个通过结构化多对象场景组合来增强3D点云与文本对比学习的新框架，利用单个3D形状构建具有明确空间关系的多对象场景，并通过大语言模型生成连贯的多对象描述。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大规模3D-文本数据集稀缺的问题，通过结构化组合样本丰富数据复杂性和多样性，提升3D-文本对比学习的效果。

Method: 利用单个3D形状构建多对象场景，通过大语言模型生成对应描述，在对比训练中增加这些结构化组合样本，系统研究关键设计要素如每场景对象数量、组合样本比例和场景构建策略。

Result: 在多个任务上取得显著性能提升，包括ModelNet、ScanObjNN、Objaverse-LVIS和ScanNet的零样本分类，ShapeNetPart的少样本部件分割，以及ScanQA的3D视觉问答。该框架具有模型无关性，能适应不同编码器架构。

Conclusion: SceneForge通过结构化组合增强有效解决了3D-文本数据稀缺问题，显著提升了多种3D理解任务的性能，并展示了强大的空间推理能力。

Abstract: The whole is greater than the sum of its parts-even in 3D-text contrastive
learning. We introduce SceneForge, a novel framework that enhances contrastive
alignment between 3D point clouds and text through structured multi-object
scene compositions. SceneForge leverages individual 3D shapes to construct
multi-object scenes with explicit spatial relations, pairing them with coherent
multi-object descriptions refined by a large language model. By augmenting
contrastive training with these structured, compositional samples, SceneForge
effectively addresses the scarcity of large-scale 3D-text datasets,
significantly enriching data complexity and diversity. We systematically
investigate critical design elements, such as the optimal number of objects per
scene, the proportion of compositional samples in training batches, and scene
construction strategies. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SceneForge
delivers substantial performance gains across multiple tasks, including
zero-shot classification on ModelNet, ScanObjNN, Objaverse-LVIS, and ScanNet,
as well as few-shot part segmentation on ShapeNetPart. SceneForge's
compositional augmentations are model-agnostic, consistently improving
performance across multiple encoder architectures. Moreover, SceneForge
improves 3D visual question answering on ScanQA, generalizes robustly to
retrieval scenarios with increasing scene complexity, and showcases spatial
reasoning capabilities by adapting spatial configurations to align precisely
with textual instructions.

TL;DR: FloorSAM是一个结合点云密度图和Segment Anything Model（SAM）的框架，用于从LiDAR数据中准确重建建筑平面图，解决了传统方法在处理噪声、泛化能力和几何细节保留方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法如几何算法和基于Mask R-CNN的深度学习方法在处理点云数据时面临噪声干扰、泛化能力有限和几何细节丢失的问题，需要一种更鲁棒和准确的建筑平面图重建方法。

Method: FloorSAM通过网格过滤、自适应分辨率投影和图像增强创建鲁棒的俯视密度图，利用SAM的零样本学习进行精确的房间分割，通过自适应提示点和多阶段过滤生成房间掩码，然后结合掩码和点云分析进行轮廓提取和正则化。

Conclusion: FloorSAM框架通过结合点云密度图和SAM模型，有效提升了建筑平面图重建的准确性和鲁棒性，能够恢复房间的拓扑关系，适用于各种室内布局。

Abstract: Reconstructing building floor plans from point cloud data is key for indoor
navigation, BIM, and precise measurements. Traditional methods like geometric
algorithms and Mask R-CNN-based deep learning often face issues with noise,
limited generalization, and loss of geometric details. We propose FloorSAM, a
framework that integrates point cloud density maps with the Segment Anything
Model (SAM) for accurate floor plan reconstruction from LiDAR data. Using
grid-based filtering, adaptive resolution projection, and image enhancement, we
create robust top-down density maps. FloorSAM uses SAM's zero-shot learning for
precise room segmentation, improving reconstruction across diverse layouts.
Room masks are generated via adaptive prompt points and multistage filtering,
followed by joint mask and point cloud analysis for contour extraction and
regularization. This produces accurate floor plans and recovers room
topological relationships. Tests on Giblayout and ISPRS datasets show better
accuracy, recall, and robustness than traditional methods, especially in noisy
and complex settings. Code and materials: github.com/Silentbarber/FloorSAM.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了ORIC基准测试，用于评估大型视觉语言模型在对象-上下文关系异常情况下的识别能力，揭示了模型在对象误识别和幻觉方面的显著缺陷。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型在图像描述、视觉问答等任务中取得了显著进展，但在对象与上下文关系异常的场景下容易出错，存在对象误识别和幻觉问题，需要系统性地评估这些局限性。

Method: 采用两种关键策略：(1) LLM引导采样识别存在但上下文异常的对象；(2) CLIP引导采样检测可能被幻觉但实际不存在的对象，构建异常上下文场景。评估了18个LVLM和2个开放词汇检测模型。

Result: 评估结果显示模型在上下文异常情况下存在显著的识别差距，暴露出模型对上下文依赖的脆弱性。

Conclusion: 这项工作揭示了LVLM在上下文感知对象识别方面的局限性，为后续研究提供了重要见解，鼓励开发更具上下文感知能力的对象识别方法。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have made significant strides in image
caption, visual question answering, and robotics by integrating visual and
textual information. However, they remain prone to errors in incongruous
contexts, where objects appear unexpectedly or are absent when contextually
expected. This leads to two key recognition failures: object misidentification
and hallucination. To systematically examine this issue, we introduce the
Object Recognition in Incongruous Context Benchmark (ORIC), a novel benchmark
that evaluates LVLMs in scenarios where object-context relationships deviate
from expectations. ORIC employs two key strategies: (1) LLM-guided sampling,
which identifies objects that are present but contextually incongruous, and (2)
CLIP-guided sampling, which detects plausible yet nonexistent objects that are
likely to be hallucinated, thereby creating an incongruous context. Evaluating
18 LVLMs and two open-vocabulary detection models, our results reveal
significant recognition gaps, underscoring the challenges posed by contextual
incongruity. This work provides critical insights into LVLMs' limitations and
encourages further research on context-aware object recognition.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型在处理高分辨率图像时面临计算开销过大的问题，现有方法将高分辨率图像分割成多个子图像会显著增加视觉分词数量，导致推理时计算复杂度指数级增长。

Method: 提出金字塔分词剪枝(PTP)策略，结合区域级和分词级的自底向上视觉显著性分析，以及自顶向下的指令引导重要性评估，选择性保留视觉显著区域和与多模态任务最相关的分词。

Result: 在13个多样化基准测试上的广泛实验表明，该方法显著降低了计算开销和推理延迟，同时性能损失最小。

Conclusion: PTP策略有效解决了高分辨率图像处理的计算效率问题，为大型视觉语言模型的实际应用提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have significantly advanced multimodal
understanding but still struggle with efficiently processing high-resolution
images. Recent approaches partition high-resolution images into multiple
sub-images, dramatically increasing the number of visual tokens and causing
exponential computational overhead during inference. To address these
limitations, we propose a training-free token pruning strategy, Pyramid Token
Pruning (PTP), that integrates bottom-up visual saliency at both region and
token levels with top-down instruction-guided importance. Inspired by human
visual attention mechanisms, PTP selectively retains more tokens from visually
salient regions and further leverages textual instructions to pinpoint tokens
most relevant to specific multimodal tasks. Extensive experiments across 13
diverse benchmarks demonstrate that our method substantially reduces
computational overhead and inference latency with minimal performance loss.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SegReg是一个分割驱动的图像配准框架，通过利用区域特定的变形模式实现解剖学自适应正则化，解决了传统方法中全局均匀平滑约束无法适应复杂解剖运动的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统深度学习方法在图像配准中采用全局均匀平滑约束，无法适应解剖运动中复杂、区域变化的变形特征，需要一种能够处理区域特异性变形的方法。

Method: SegReg首先通过分割将输入图像分解为解剖学一致的子区域，然后使用相同的配准骨干网络计算优化的部分变形场，最后将这些部分变形场整合为全局变形场。

Result: 在使用真实分割标签时，SegReg在关键解剖结构上达到98.23%的Dice分数，在三个临床配准场景（心脏、腹部和肺部图像）中比现有方法提升2-12%，即使使用自动分割也能保持良好性能。

Conclusion: SegReg展示了配准精度与分割质量之间的近线性依赖关系，将配准挑战转化为分割问题，为解剖学自适应配准提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Deep learning has revolutionized image registration by its ability to handle
diverse tasks while achieving significant speed advantages over conventional
approaches. Current approaches, however, often employ globally uniform
smoothness constraints that fail to accommodate the complex, regionally varying
deformations characteristic of anatomical motion. To address this limitation,
we propose SegReg, a Segmentation-driven Registration framework that implements
anatomically adaptive regularization by exploiting region-specific deformation
patterns. Our SegReg first decomposes input moving and fixed images into
anatomically coherent subregions through segmentation. These localized domains
are then processed by the same registration backbone to compute optimized
partial deformation fields, which are subsequently integrated into a global
deformation field. SegReg achieves near-perfect structural alignment (98.23%
Dice on critical anatomies) using ground-truth segmentation, and outperforms
existing methods by 2-12% across three clinical registration scenarios
(cardiac, abdominal, and lung images) even with automatic segmentation. Our
SegReg demonstrates a near-linear dependence of registration accuracy on
segmentation quality, transforming the registration challenge into a
segmentation problem. The source code will be released upon manuscript
acceptance.

Motivation: 现有基于冻结预训练模型和提示的方法虽然能缓解灾难性遗忘，但会导致塑性损失，即模型学习新知识的能力下降。作者认为这是由于训练过程中未充分利用参数缺乏更新活力所致。

Method: 提出Continual Backpropagation Prompt Network (CBPNet)，创新性地集成高效CBP模块，通过自适应重新初始化未充分利用参数来对抗塑性衰减。

Result: 在Split CIFAR-100上比强基线提高超过1%的平均准确率，在更具挑战性的Split ImageNet-R上达到69.41%的SOTA准确率，仅需训练少于主干网络0.2%的额外参数。

Conclusion: CBPNet是一个有效且参数高效的框架，能够恢复模型的学习活力，在边缘设备的持续学习任务中表现出色。

Abstract: To meet the demands of applications like robotics and autonomous driving that
require real-time responses to dynamic environments, efficient continual
learning methods suitable for edge devices have attracted increasing attention.
In this transition, using frozen pretrained models with prompts has become a
mainstream strategy to combat catastrophic forgetting. However, this approach
introduces a new critical bottleneck: plasticity loss, where the model's
ability to learn new knowledge diminishes due to the frozen backbone and the
limited capacity of prompt parameters. We argue that the reduction in
plasticity stems from a lack of update vitality in underutilized parameters
during the training process. To this end, we propose the Continual
Backpropagation Prompt Network (CBPNet), an effective and parameter efficient
framework designed to restore the model's learning vitality. We innovatively
integrate an Efficient CBP Block that counteracts plasticity decay by
adaptively reinitializing these underutilized parameters. Experimental results
on edge devices demonstrate CBPNet's effectiveness across multiple benchmarks.
On Split CIFAR-100, it improves average accuracy by over 1% against a strong
baseline, and on the more challenging Split ImageNet-R, it achieves a state of
the art accuracy of 69.41%. This is accomplished by training additional
parameters that constitute less than 0.2% of the backbone's size, validating
our approach.

Conclusion: MedForensics数据集和DSKI检测器为医学图像取证提供了有效的解决方案，能够可靠地识别AI生成的伪造医学图像。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative AI in medical imaging has introduced both
significant opportunities and serious challenges, especially the risk that fake
medical images could undermine healthcare systems. These synthetic images pose
serious risks, such as diagnostic deception, financial fraud, and
misinformation. However, research on medical forensics to counter these threats
remains limited, and there is a critical lack of comprehensive datasets
specifically tailored for this field. Additionally, existing media forensic
methods, which are primarily designed for natural or facial images, are
inadequate for capturing the distinct characteristics and subtle artifacts of
AI-generated medical images. To tackle these challenges, we introduce
\textbf{MedForensics}, a large-scale medical forensics dataset encompassing six
medical modalities and twelve state-of-the-art medical generative models. We
also propose \textbf{DSKI}, a novel \textbf{D}ual-\textbf{S}tage
\textbf{K}nowledge \textbf{I}nfusing detector that constructs a vision-language
feature space tailored for the detection of AI-generated medical images. DSKI
comprises two core components: 1) a cross-domain fine-trace adapter (CDFA) for
extracting subtle forgery clues from both spatial and noise domains during
training, and 2) a medical forensic retrieval module (MFRM) that boosts
detection accuracy through few-shot retrieval during testing. Experimental
results demonstrate that DSKI significantly outperforms both existing methods
and human experts, achieving superior accuracy across multiple medical
modalities.

Conclusion: 通过多专家协作的框架设计，TrueMoE能够有效捕捉多样化的伪造线索，显著提升了合成图像检测的泛化性能。

Abstract: The rapid progress of generative models has made synthetic image detection an
increasingly critical task. Most existing approaches attempt to construct a
single, universal discriminative space to separate real from fake content.
However, such unified spaces tend to be complex and brittle, often struggling
to generalize to unseen generative patterns. In this work, we propose TrueMoE,
a novel dual-routing Mixture-of-Discriminative-Experts framework that
reformulates the detection task as a collaborative inference across multiple
specialized and lightweight discriminative subspaces. At the core of TrueMoE is
a Discriminative Expert Array (DEA) organized along complementary axes of
manifold structure and perceptual granularity, enabling diverse forgery cues to
be captured across subspaces. A dual-routing mechanism, comprising a
granularity-aware sparse router and a manifold-aware dense router, adaptively
assigns input images to the most relevant experts. Extensive experiments across
a wide spectrum of generative models demonstrate that TrueMoE achieves superior
generalization and robustness.

Method: 提出可微分关键帧选择机制，通过三阶段过程系统识别语义拐点；包含TAD模块（利用变化评分、拐点检测和优先级蒸馏选择信息最丰富的帧）和KF-GRPO模块（实现对比学习范式，使用显著性增强奖励机制激励模型利用帧内容和时间关系）。

Conclusion: ChronoForge-RL框架有效解决了视频理解中的计算效率和语义帧识别问题，在保持计算效率的同时显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Current state-of-the-art video understanding methods typically struggle with
two critical challenges: (1) the computational infeasibility of processing
every frame in dense video content and (2) the difficulty in identifying
semantically significant frames through naive uniform sampling strategies. In
this paper, we propose a novel video understanding framework, called
ChronoForge-RL, which combines Temporal Apex Distillation (TAD) and
KeyFrame-aware Group Relative Policy Optimization (KF-GRPO) to tackle these
issues. Concretely, we introduce a differentiable keyframe selection mechanism
that systematically identifies semantic inflection points through a three-stage
process to enhance computational efficiency while preserving temporal
information. Then, two particular modules are proposed to enable effective
temporal reasoning: Firstly, TAD leverages variation scoring, inflection
detection, and prioritized distillation to select the most informative frames.
Secondly, we introduce KF-GRPO which implements a contrastive learning paradigm
with a saliency-enhanced reward mechanism that explicitly incentivizes models
to leverage both frame content and temporal relationships. Finally, our
proposed ChronoForge-RL achieves 69.1% on VideoMME and 52.7% on LVBench
compared to baseline methods, clearly surpassing previous approaches while
enabling our 7B parameter model to achieve performance comparable to 72B
parameter alternatives.

Conclusion: 研究结果不仅加深了对感受野响应关系的理解，还为设计高效计算方案和构建生物视觉计算的理论模型提供了基础。

Abstract: Because of the variabilities of real-world image structures under the natural
image transformations that arise when observing similar objects or
spatio-temporal events under different viewing conditions, the receptive field
responses computed in the earliest layers of the visual hierarchy may be
strongly influenced by such geometric image transformations. One way of
handling this variability is by basing the vision system on covariant receptive
field families, which expand the receptive field shapes over the degrees of
freedom in the image transformations.
  This paper addresses the problem of deriving relationships between spatial
and spatio-temporal receptive field responses obtained for different values of
the shape parameters in the resulting multi-parameter families of receptive
fields. For this purpose, we derive both (i) infinitesimal relationships,
roughly corresponding to a combination of notions from semi-groups and Lie
groups, as well as (ii) macroscopic cascade smoothing properties, which
describe how receptive field responses at coarser spatial and temporal scales
can be computed by applying smaller support incremental filters to the output
from corresponding receptive fields at finer spatial and temporal scales,
structurally related to the notion of Lie algebras, although with directional
preferences.
  The presented results provide (i) a deeper understanding of the relationships
between spatial and spatio-temporal receptive field responses for different
values of the filter parameters, which can be used for both (ii) designing more
efficient schemes for computing receptive field responses over populations of
multi-parameter families of receptive fields, as well as (iii)~formulating
idealized theoretical models of the computations of simple cells in biological
vision.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CIDER是一个模型无关的推理时框架，通过提示词优化来减轻文本到图像模型的品牌偏见，无需重新训练模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 文本到图像模型存在显著的'品牌偏见'，即在通用提示下倾向于生成包含主导商业品牌的内容，这带来了伦理和法律风险。

Method: CIDER使用轻量级检测器识别品牌内容，并利用视觉语言模型生成风格不同的替代方案。提出了品牌中立性评分来量化该问题。

Result: 实验表明CIDER显著减少了显性和隐性偏见，同时保持了图像质量和美学吸引力。

Conclusion: 该工作为生成更原创和公平的内容提供了实用解决方案，有助于开发可信赖的生成式AI。

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models exhibit a significant yet under-explored "brand
bias", a tendency to generate contents featuring dominant commercial brands
from generic prompts, posing ethical and legal risks. We propose CIDER, a
novel, model-agnostic framework to mitigate bias at inference-time through
prompt refinement to avoid costly retraining. CIDER uses a lightweight detector
to identify branded content and a Vision-Language Model (VLM) to generate
stylistically divergent alternatives. We introduce the Brand Neutrality Score
(BNS) to quantify this issue and perform extensive experiments on leading T2I
models. Results show CIDER significantly reduces both explicit and implicit
biases while maintaining image quality and aesthetic appeal. Our work offers a
practical solution for more original and equitable content, contributing to the
development of trustworthy generative AI.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了人类视觉的中央凹特性（中心高分辨率、周边低分辨率）在自监督学习中对物体表征发展的影响，发现模拟这种视觉特性可以提高物体表征的质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自监督学习模型忽略了人类视觉的中央凹特性，即视觉场中心分辨率高、周边分辨率低的特点。本研究旨在探索这种视觉特性在物体表征学习中的作用。

Method: 使用两个以自我为中心的视频数据集，应用人类中央凹和皮层放大模型来修改输入，使视觉内容在周边变得不那么清晰。使用基于时间的学习目标训练两个生物启发的自监督学习模型。

Result: 模拟中央凹视觉特性提高了学习到的物体表征质量，这种改进源于使物体显得更大，并在中央和周边视觉信息之间实现了更好的权衡。

Conclusion: 这项工作使人类视觉表征学习模型更加现实和高效，为理解视觉系统发展提供了重要洞见。

Abstract: Recent self-supervised learning models simulate the development of semantic
object representations by training on visual experience similar to that of
toddlers. However, these models ignore the foveated nature of human vision with
high/low resolution in the center/periphery of the visual field. Here, we
investigate the role of this varying resolution in the development of object
representations. We leverage two datasets of egocentric videos that capture the
visual experience of humans during interactions with objects. We apply models
of human foveation and cortical magnification to modify these inputs, such that
the visual content becomes less distinct towards the periphery. The resulting
sequences are used to train two bio-inspired self-supervised learning models
that implement a time-based learning objective. Our results show that modeling
aspects of foveated vision improves the quality of the learned object
representations in this setting. Our analysis suggests that this improvement
comes from making objects appear bigger and inducing a better trade-off between
central and peripheral visual information. Overall, this work takes a step
towards making models of humans' learning of visual representations more
realistic and performant.

TL;DR: 本文介绍了MCOD，首个专门用于多光谱伪装目标检测的基准数据集，解决了现有RGB数据集在多光谱方法支持上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的伪装目标检测基准数据集仅基于RGB图像，缺乏对多光谱方法的支持，这阻碍了该领域的发展。多光谱图像提供丰富的频谱信息，有望增强前景-背景区分能力。

Method: 创建MCOD数据集，包含三个关键优势：(i) 全面的挑战属性，捕捉真实世界中的困难；(ii) 多样化的真实场景；(iii) 高质量的像素级标注。在MCOD上对11种代表性COD方法进行基准测试。

Result: 基准测试显示由于任务难度增加，性能一致下降。但整合多光谱模态显著缓解了这种性能下降，突显了频谱信息在增强检测鲁棒性方面的价值。

Conclusion: MCOD为多光谱伪装目标检测的未来研究提供了坚实基础，数据集已公开可用。

Abstract: Camouflaged Object Detection (COD) aims to identify objects that blend
seamlessly into natural scenes. Although RGB-based methods have advanced, their
performance remains limited under challenging conditions. Multispectral
imagery, providing rich spectral information, offers a promising alternative
for enhanced foreground-background discrimination. However, existing COD
benchmark datasets are exclusively RGB-based, lacking essential support for
multispectral approaches, which has impeded progress in this area. To address
this gap, we introduce MCOD, the first challenging benchmark dataset
specifically designed for multispectral camouflaged object detection. MCOD
features three key advantages: (i) Comprehensive challenge attributes: It
captures real-world difficulties such as small object sizes and extreme
lighting conditions commonly encountered in COD tasks. (ii) Diverse real-world
scenarios: The dataset spans a wide range of natural environments to better
reflect practical applications. (iii) High-quality pixel-level annotations:
Each image is manually annotated with precise object masks and corresponding
challenge attribute labels. We benchmark eleven representative COD methods on
MCOD, observing a consistent performance drop due to increased task difficulty.
Notably, integrating multispectral modalities substantially alleviates this
degradation, highlighting the value of spectral information in enhancing
detection robustness. We anticipate MCOD will provide a strong foundation for
future research in multispectral camouflaged object detection. The dataset is
publicly accessible at https://github.com/yl2900260-bit/MCOD.

TL;DR: CrossI2P是一个自监督框架，通过统一跨模态学习和两阶段配准来解决图像到点云配准的挑战，在KITTI和nuScenes基准上显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决2D图像和3D点云之间的语义-几何差距问题，以及现有方法容易陷入局部最优的局限性，实现更鲁棒的跨模态感知。

Method: 采用端到端自监督框架：1）通过双路径对比学习构建几何-语义融合嵌入空间；2）粗到精配准范式：全局阶段建立超点-超像素对应关系，局部阶段进行几何约束的点级细化；3）使用梯度归一化的动态训练机制平衡不同损失。

Result: 在KITTI Odometry基准上性能提升23.7%，在nuScenes基准上提升37.9%，显著提高了配准精度和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: CrossI2P通过统一的跨模态学习和两阶段配准策略，有效解决了图像到点云配准的核心挑战，为自动驾驶系统的鲁棒感知提供了有力支持。

Abstract: Bridging 2D and 3D sensor modalities is critical for robust perception in
autonomous systems. However, image-to-point cloud (I2P) registration remains
challenging due to the semantic-geometric gap between texture-rich but
depth-ambiguous images and sparse yet metrically precise point clouds, as well
as the tendency of existing methods to converge to local optima. To overcome
these limitations, we introduce CrossI2P, a self-supervised framework that
unifies cross-modal learning and two-stage registration in a single end-to-end
pipeline. First, we learn a geometric-semantic fused embedding space via
dual-path contrastive learning, enabling annotation-free, bidirectional
alignment of 2D textures and 3D structures. Second, we adopt a coarse-to-fine
registration paradigm: a global stage establishes superpoint-superpixel
correspondences through joint intra-modal context and cross-modal interaction
modeling, followed by a geometry-constrained point-level refinement for precise
registration. Third, we employ a dynamic training mechanism with gradient
normalization to balance losses for feature alignment, correspondence
refinement, and pose estimation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
CrossI2P outperforms state-of-the-art methods by 23.7% on the KITTI Odometry
benchmark and by 37.9% on nuScenes, significantly improving both accuracy and
robustness.

Motivation: 生态研究中的样方图像分析需要大量人工识别工作，AI技术可以显著提高专家的工作效率，扩大生态研究的范围和覆盖面。

Method: 使用包含170万张单标签植物图像的大规模训练集，以及预训练的视觉Transformer模型，对高分辨率样方图像进行多标签分类预测。

Result: 挑战赛提供了数千张专家标注的多标签测试图像，涵盖800多个物种，为评估植物识别算法的进展提供了标准基准。

Conclusion: PlantCLEF 2024挑战赛通过提供标准化数据集和评估方法，推动了植物物种自动识别技术的发展，有助于生态研究的规模化应用。

Abstract: Plot images are essential for ecological studies, enabling standardized
sampling, biodiversity assessment, long-term monitoring and remote, large-scale
surveys. Plot images are typically fifty centimetres or one square meter in
size, and botanists meticulously identify all the species found there. The
integration of AI could significantly improve the efficiency of specialists,
helping them to extend the scope and coverage of ecological studies. To
evaluate advances in this regard, the PlantCLEF 2024 challenge leverages a new
test set of thousands of multi-label images annotated by experts and covering
over 800 species. In addition, it provides a large training set of 1.7 million
individual plant images as well as state-of-the-art vision transformer models
pre-trained on this data. The task is evaluated as a (weakly-labeled)
multi-label classification task where the aim is to predict all the plant
species present on a high-resolution plot image (using the single-label
training data). In this paper, we provide an detailed description of the data,
the evaluation methodology, the methods and models employed by the participants

TL;DR: RACap是一个关系感知的检索增强图像描述模型，通过挖掘检索描述中的结构化关系语义和识别图像中的异构对象，解决了现有方法在关系建模上的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的检索增强图像描述方法在关系建模方面存在挑战：语义提示表示过于粗粒度，无法捕捉细粒度关系；缺乏对图像对象及其语义关系的显式建模。

Method: RACap不仅从检索描述中挖掘结构化关系语义，还识别图像中的异构对象，有效检索包含异构视觉信息的结构化关系特征，以增强语义一致性和关系表达能力。

Result: 实验结果表明，RACap仅使用1080万个可训练参数，在性能上优于之前的轻量级描述模型。

Conclusion: RACap通过关系感知的检索增强方法，有效提升了图像描述的质量，特别是在关系建模方面表现出色。

Abstract: Recent retrieval-augmented image captioning methods incorporate external
knowledge to compensate for the limitations in comprehending complex scenes.
However, current approaches face challenges in relation modeling: (1) the
representation of semantic prompts is too coarse-grained to capture
fine-grained relationships; (2) these methods lack explicit modeling of image
objects and their semantic relationships. To address these limitations, we
propose RACap, a relation-aware retrieval-augmented model for image captioning,
which not only mines structured relation semantics from retrieval captions, but
also identifies heterogeneous objects from the image. RACap effectively
retrieves structured relation features that contain heterogeneous visual
information to enhance the semantic consistency and relational expressiveness.
Experimental results show that RACap, with only 10.8M trainable parameters,
achieves superior performance compared to previous lightweight captioning
models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的SDS方法存在两个根本限制：(1)依赖CLIP式文本编码器导致粗粒度语义对齐，难以处理细粒度提示；(2)2D扩散先验缺乏明确的3D空间约束，导致几何不一致和多对象场景中的关系不准确。

Method: 提出VLM3D框架，将大型视觉语言模型作为可微分的语义和空间先验集成到SDS流程中。基于开源的Qwen2.5-VL模型实现，利用其丰富的语言基础监督和固有的视觉语言建模能力。

Result: 在GPTeval3D基准测试中，VLM3D在多样对象和复杂场景上显著优于先前的SDS方法，在语义保真度、几何一致性和空间正确性方面表现优异。

Conclusion: VLM3D通过集成视觉语言模型作为语义和空间先验，有效解决了文本到3D生成中的语义对齐和3D一致性问题，为高质量3D内容生成提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) enables high-quality text-to-3D generation
by supervising 3D models through the denoising of multi-view 2D renderings,
using a pretrained text-to-image diffusion model to align with the input prompt
and ensure 3D consistency. However, existing SDS-based methods face two
fundamental limitations: (1) their reliance on CLIP-style text encoders leads
to coarse semantic alignment and struggles with fine-grained prompts; and (2)
2D diffusion priors lack explicit 3D spatial constraints, resulting in
geometric inconsistencies and inaccurate object relationships in multi-object
scenes. To address these challenges, we propose VLM3D, a novel text-to-3D
generation framework that integrates large vision-language models (VLMs) into
the SDS pipeline as differentiable semantic and spatial priors. Unlike standard
text-to-image diffusion priors, VLMs leverage rich language-grounded
supervision that enables fine-grained prompt alignment. Moreover, their
inherent vision language modeling provides strong spatial understanding, which
significantly enhances 3D consistency for single-object generation and improves
relational reasoning in multi-object scenes. We instantiate VLM3D based on the
open-source Qwen2.5-VL model and evaluate it on the GPTeval3D benchmark.
Experiments across diverse objects and complex scenes show that VLM3D
significantly outperforms prior SDS-based methods in semantic fidelity,
geometric coherence, and spatial correctness.

Abstract: Video object segmentation (VOS) is a challenging task with wide applications
such as video editing and autonomous driving. While Cutie provides strong
query-based segmentation and SAM2 offers enriched representations via a
pretrained ViT encoder, each has limitations in feature capacity and temporal
modeling. In this report, we propose a framework that integrates their
complementary strengths by replacing the encoder of Cutie with the ViT encoder
of SAM2 and introducing a motion prediction module for temporal stability. We
further adopt an ensemble strategy combining Cutie, SAM2, and our variant,
achieving 3rd place in the MOSEv2 track of the 7th LSVOS Challenge. We refer to
our final model as SCOPE (SAM2-CUTIE Object Prediction Ensemble). This
demonstrates the effectiveness of enriched feature representation and motion
prediction for robust video object segmentation. The code is available at

Conclusion: LevirSCD数据集和FoBa方法有效解决了遥感语义变化检测的关键挑战，在多个数据集上取得了竞争性结果。

Abstract: Despite the remarkable progress achieved in remote sensing semantic change
detection (SCD), two major challenges remain. At the data level, existing SCD
datasets suffer from limited change categories, insufficient change types, and
a lack of fine-grained class definitions, making them inadequate to fully
support practical applications. At the methodological level, most current
approaches underutilize change information, typically treating it as a
post-processing step to enhance spatial consistency, which constrains further
improvements in model performance. To address these issues, we construct a new
benchmark for remote sensing SCD, LevirSCD. Focused on the Beijing area, the
dataset covers 16 change categories and 210 specific change types, with more
fine-grained class definitions (e.g., roads are divided into unpaved and paved
roads). Furthermore, we propose a foreground-background co-guided SCD (FoBa)
method, which leverages foregrounds that focus on regions of interest and
backgrounds enriched with contextual information to guide the model
collaboratively, thereby alleviating semantic ambiguity while enhancing its
ability to detect subtle changes. Considering the requirements of bi-temporal
interaction and spatial consistency in SCD, we introduce a Gated Interaction
Fusion (GIF) module along with a simple consistency loss to further enhance the
model's detection performance. Extensive experiments on three datasets (SECOND,
JL1, and the proposed LevirSCD) demonstrate that FoBa achieves competitive
results compared to current SOTA methods, with improvements of 1.48%, 3.61%,
and 2.81% in the SeK metric, respectively. Our code and dataset are available

Conclusion: 通过信息论框架学习最小充分语义表示是解决无监督域泛化问题的有效方法，无需依赖类别或域标签即可实现优异的泛化性能。

Abstract: The generalization ability of deep learning has been extensively studied in
supervised settings, yet it remains less explored in unsupervised scenarios.
Recently, the Unsupervised Domain Generalization (UDG) task has been proposed
to enhance the generalization of models trained with prevalent unsupervised
learning techniques, such as Self-Supervised Learning (SSL). UDG confronts the
challenge of distinguishing semantics from variations without category labels.
Although some recent methods have employed domain labels to tackle this issue,
such domain labels are often unavailable in real-world contexts. In this paper,
we address these limitations by formalizing UDG as the task of learning a
Minimal Sufficient Semantic Representation: a representation that (i) preserves
all semantic information shared across augmented views (sufficiency), and (ii)
maximally removes information irrelevant to semantics (minimality). We
theoretically ground these objectives from the perspective of information
theory, demonstrating that optimizing representations to achieve sufficiency
and minimality directly reduces out-of-distribution risk. Practically, we
implement this optimization through Minimal-Sufficient UDG (MS-UDG), a
learnable model by integrating (a) an InfoNCE-based objective to achieve
sufficiency; (b) two complementary components to promote minimality: a novel
semantic-variation disentanglement loss and a reconstruction-based mechanism
for capturing adequate variation. Empirically, MS-UDG sets a new
state-of-the-art on popular unsupervised domain-generalization benchmarks,
consistently outperforming existing SSL and UDG methods, without category or
domain labels during representation learning.

Abstract: Explainable artificial intelligence is increasingly employed to understand
the decision-making process of deep learning models and create trustworthiness
in their adoption. However, the explainability of Monocular Depth Estimation
(MDE) remains largely unexplored despite its wide deployment in real-world
applications. In this work, we study how to analyze MDE networks to map the
input image to the predicted depth map. More in detail, we investigate
well-established feature attribution methods, Saliency Maps, Integrated
Gradients, and Attention Rollout on different computationally complex models
for MDE: METER, a lightweight network, and PixelFormer, a deep network. We
assess the quality of the generated visual explanations by selectively
perturbing the most relevant and irrelevant pixels, as identified by the
explainability methods, and analyzing the impact of these perturbations on the
model's output. Moreover, since existing evaluation metrics can have some
limitations in measuring the validity of visual explanations for MDE, we
additionally introduce the Attribution Fidelity. This metric evaluates the
reliability of the feature attribution by assessing their consistency with the
predicted depth map. Experimental results demonstrate that Saliency Maps and
Integrated Gradients have good performance in highlighting the most important
input features for MDE lightweight and deep models, respectively. Furthermore,
we show that Attribution Fidelity effectively identifies whether an
explainability method fails to produce reliable visual maps, even in scenarios
where conventional metrics might suggest satisfactory results.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAM在自然图像领域表现出强大的零样本分割能力，但在遥感数据上泛化能力不足，难以应对复杂地形、多尺度目标和时序动态等独特挑战。

Method: TASAM在SAM主干网络基础上集成了三个轻量级模块：地形感知适配器注入高程先验、时序提示生成器捕捉土地覆盖变化、多尺度融合策略增强细粒度目标分割。

Result: 在不重新训练SAM主干的情况下，TASAM在LoveDA、iSAID和WHU-CD三个遥感基准测试中显著优于零样本SAM和任务特定模型，且计算开销极小。

Conclusion: 研究证明了领域自适应增强对基础模型的价值，为构建更鲁棒的地理空间分割系统提供了可扩展的路径。

Abstract: Segment Anything Model (SAM) has demonstrated impressive zero-shot
segmentation capabilities across natural image domains, but it struggles to
generalize to the unique challenges of remote sensing data, such as complex
terrain, multi-scale objects, and temporal dynamics. In this paper, we
introduce TASAM, a terrain and temporally-aware extension of SAM designed
specifically for high-resolution remote sensing image segmentation. TASAM
integrates three lightweight yet effective modules: a terrain-aware adapter
that injects elevation priors, a temporal prompt generator that captures
land-cover changes over time, and a multi-scale fusion strategy that enhances
fine-grained object delineation. Without retraining the SAM backbone, our
approach achieves substantial performance gains across three remote sensing
benchmarks-LoveDA, iSAID, and WHU-CD-outperforming both zero-shot SAM and
task-specific models with minimal computational overhead. Our results highlight
the value of domain-adaptive augmentation for foundation models and offer a
scalable path toward more robust geospatial segmentation.

Motivation: 现有单目深度估计方法在物体边界处往往产生模糊的深度值，引入虚假的3D点，而获得锐利边缘通常需要非常精细的监督信号。

Method: 将每个像素的深度建模为混合分布，捕捉多个可能的深度值，将不确定性从直接回归转移到混合权重上。通过方差感知损失函数和不确定性传播无缝集成到现有流程中。

Abstract: Accurate monocular depth estimation is crucial for 3D scene understanding,
but existing methods often blur depth at object boundaries, introducing
spurious intermediate 3D points. While achieving sharp edges usually requires
very fine-grained supervision, our method produces crisp depth discontinuities
using only self-supervision. Specifically, we model per-pixel depth as a
mixture distribution, capturing multiple plausible depths and shifting
uncertainty from direct regression to the mixture weights. This formulation
integrates seamlessly into existing pipelines via variance-aware loss functions
and uncertainty propagation. Extensive evaluations on KITTI and VKITTIv2 show
that our method achieves up to 35% higher boundary sharpness and improves point
cloud quality compared to state-of-the-art baselines.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于知识迁移的主动学习方法，通过教师-学生模式来提升不确定性估计，无需复杂辅助模型或特殊训练方式，适用于多种任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有主动学习方法的不确定性估计需要复杂的辅助模型和特殊训练方式，难以应用于领域任务（如冷冻电子断层扫描分类）。

Method: 采用教师-学生模式，教师是主动学习中的任务模型，学生是从教师学习的辅助模型。在每次主动学习周期中同时训练两个模型，通过模型输出间的距离来度量未标记数据的不确定性。

Result: 在经典计算机视觉任务和冷冻电子断层扫描挑战上的实验验证了方法的有效性和效率。

Conclusion: 该方法证明了数据不确定性不依赖于任务损失的具体值，而与任务损失的上界密切相关，提供了一种通用且高效的不确定性估计方案。

Abstract: Uncertainty estimation is at the core of Active Learning (AL). Most existing
methods resort to complex auxiliary models and advanced training fashions to
estimate uncertainty for unlabeled data. These models need special design and
hence are difficult to train especially for domain tasks, such as Cryo-Electron
Tomography (cryo-ET) classification in computational biology. To address this
challenge, we propose a novel method using knowledge transfer to boost
uncertainty estimation in AL. Specifically, we exploit the teacher-student mode
where the teacher is the task model in AL and the student is an auxiliary model
that learns from the teacher. We train the two models simultaneously in each AL
cycle and adopt a certain distance between the model outputs to measure
uncertainty for unlabeled data. The student model is task-agnostic and does not
rely on special training fashions (e.g. adversarial), making our method
suitable for various tasks. More importantly, we demonstrate that data
uncertainty is not tied to concrete value of task loss but closely related to
the upper-bound of task loss. We conduct extensive experiments to validate the
proposed method on classical computer vision tasks and cryo-ET challenges. The
results demonstrate its efficacy and efficiency.

*Johannes Leonhardt,Juergen Gall,Ribana Roscher*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LC-SLab是首个用于稀疏监督下大规模土地覆盖分类的基于对象的深度学习框架，通过图神经网络和语义分割后处理两种聚合方法，在保持精度的同时显著减少了预测碎片化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习土地覆盖制图方法在使用稀疏现场数据时会产生碎片化和噪声预测，而基于对象的分类方法虽然能通过分配标签给语义连贯区域来施加最小制图单元，但在深度学习管道中仍未被充分探索。

Method: 提出LC-SLab框架，支持通过图神经网络进行输入级聚合和通过后处理语义分割结果进行输出级聚合，并整合预训练网络特征来提升小数据集性能。在Sentinel-2年度合成数据和稀疏LUCAS标签上进行评估。

Result: 基于对象的方法在匹配或超过常见像素级模型精度的同时，产生更连贯的地图。输入级聚合在小数据集上更稳健，输出级聚合在数据更多时表现最佳。多个LC-SLab配置优于现有土地覆盖产品。

Conclusion: LC-SLab框架展示了基于对象方法在稀疏监督土地覆盖分类中的实用价值，为大规模地球科学应用提供了更可靠的制图解决方案。

Abstract: Large-scale land cover maps generated using deep learning play a critical
role across a wide range of Earth science applications. Open in-situ datasets
from principled land cover surveys offer a scalable alternative to manual
annotation for training such models. However, their sparse spatial coverage
often leads to fragmented and noisy predictions when used with existing deep
learning-based land cover mapping approaches. A promising direction to address
this issue is object-based classification, which assigns labels to semantically
coherent image regions rather than individual pixels, thereby imposing a
minimum mapping unit. Despite this potential, object-based methods remain
underexplored in deep learning-based land cover mapping pipelines, especially
in the context of medium-resolution imagery and sparse supervision. To address
this gap, we propose LC-SLab, the first deep learning framework for
systematically exploring object-based deep learning methods for large-scale
land cover classification under sparse supervision. LC-SLab supports both
input-level aggregation via graph neural networks, and output-level aggregation
by postprocessing results from established semantic segmentation models.
Additionally, we incorporate features from a large pre-trained network to
improve performance on small datasets. We evaluate the framework on annual
Sentinel-2 composites with sparse LUCAS labels, focusing on the tradeoff
between accuracy and fragmentation, as well as sensitivity to dataset size. Our
results show that object-based methods can match or exceed the accuracy of
common pixel-wise models while producing substantially more coherent maps.
Input-level aggregation proves more robust on smaller datasets, whereas
output-level aggregation performs best with more data. Several configurations
of LC-SLab also outperform existing land cover products, highlighting the
framework's practical utility.

TL;DR: SEE&TREK是首个针对视觉约束下多模态大语言模型空间理解能力提升的训练无关提示框架，通过增加视觉多样性和运动重建两个核心原则来增强空间推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常依赖深度图或点云等额外模态来改进空间推理，但纯视觉空间理解仍未被充分探索。SEE&TREK旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 采用最大语义丰富度采样提取语义丰富的关键帧来捕捉场景结构，并通过模拟视觉轨迹和编码相对空间位置来重建运动，保持空间关系和时间一致性。该方法无需训练和GPU，仅需单次前向传播。

Result: 在VSI-BENCH和STI-BENCH上的广泛实验表明，SEE&TREK在各种空间推理任务中持续提升多种MLLM性能，最高提升达3.5%。

Conclusion: SEE&TREK为增强空间智能提供了一条有前景的路径，能够无缝集成到现有MLLM中。

Abstract: We introduce SEE&TREK, the first training-free prompting framework tailored
to enhance the spatial understanding of Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMS) under vision-only constraints. While prior efforts have incorporated
modalities like depth or point clouds to improve spatial reasoning, purely
visualspatial understanding remains underexplored. SEE&TREK addresses this gap
by focusing on two core principles: increasing visual diversity and motion
reconstruction. For visual diversity, we conduct Maximum Semantic Richness
Sampling, which employs an off-the-shell perception model to extract
semantically rich keyframes that capture scene structure. For motion
reconstruction, we simulate visual trajectories and encode relative spatial
positions into keyframes to preserve both spatial relations and temporal
coherence. Our method is training&GPU-free, requiring only a single forward
pass, and can be seamlessly integrated into existing MLLM'S. Extensive
experiments on the VSI-B ENCH and STI-B ENCH show that S EE &T REK consistently
boosts various MLLM S performance across diverse spatial reasoning tasks with
the most +3.5% improvement, offering a promising path toward stronger spatial
intelligence.

Motivation: 现有3D视觉定位方法面临两个主要挑战：难以处理3D高斯泼溅中的隐式空间纹理表示，需要逐场景训练；需要大量标注数据进行有效训练。

Method: 提出基于视图检索的定位框架，通过对象级视图检索从多个视角收集定位线索，将3D视觉定位转化为2D检索任务。

Result: 大量实验表明，该方法在避免逐场景训练的同时实现了最先进的视觉定位性能。

Conclusion: GVR为零样本3D视觉定位研究提供了坚实基础，在保持高性能的同时显著降低了训练成本。

Abstract: 3D Visual Grounding (3DVG) aims to locate objects in 3D scenes based on text
prompts, which is essential for applications such as robotics. However,
existing 3DVG methods encounter two main challenges: first, they struggle to
handle the implicit representation of spatial textures in 3D Gaussian Splatting
(3DGS), making per-scene training indispensable; second, they typically require
larges amounts of labeled data for effective training. To this end, we propose
\underline{G}rounding via \underline{V}iew \underline{R}etrieval (GVR), a novel
zero-shot visual grounding framework for 3DGS to transform 3DVG as a 2D
retrieval task that leverages object-level view retrieval to collect grounding
clues from multiple views, which not only avoids the costly process of 3D
annotation, but also eliminates the need for per-scene training. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art visual
grounding performance while avoiding per-scene training, providing a solid
foundation for zero-shot 3DVG research. Video demos can be found in

Result: 在CVPR 2025挑战赛中，ENSAM在隐藏测试集上获得DSC AUC 2.404、NSD AUC 2.266、最终DSC 0.627和最终NSD 0.597，优于VISTA3D和SAM-Med3D，与SegVol相当。在核心集赛道中排名第5，是未使用预训练权重方法中表现最好的。

Conclusion: ENSAM证明了在有限资源下开发高效3D医学图像分割模型的可行性，相对位置编码和Muon优化器显著加速收敛并提高分割质量。

Abstract: We present ENSAM (Equivariant, Normalized, Segment Anything Model), a
lightweight and promptable model for universal 3D medical image segmentation.
ENSAM combines a SegResNet-based encoder with a prompt encoder and mask decoder
in a U-Net-style architecture, using latent cross-attention, relative
positional encoding, normalized attention, and the Muon optimizer for training.
ENSAM is designed to achieve good performance under limited data and
computational budgets, and is trained from scratch on under 5,000 volumes from
multiple modalities (CT, MRI, PET, ultrasound, microscopy) on a single 32 GB
GPU in 6 hours. As part of the CVPR 2025 Foundation Models for Interactive 3D
Biomedical Image Segmentation Challenge, ENSAM was evaluated on hidden test set
with multimodal 3D medical images, obtaining a DSC AUC of 2.404, NSD AUC of
2.266, final DSC of 0.627, and final NSD of 0.597, outperforming two previously
published baseline models (VISTA3D, SAM-Med3D) and matching the third (SegVol),
surpassing its performance in final DSC but trailing behind in the other three
metrics. In the coreset track of the challenge, ENSAM ranks 5th of 10 overall
and best among the approaches not utilizing pretrained weights. Ablation
studies confirm that our use of relative positional encodings and the Muon
optimizer each substantially speed up convergence and improve segmentation
quality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉语言模型防御方法通常需要昂贵的重新训练或重大架构修改，需要一种轻量级、即插即用的解决方案

Method: 使用张量分解技术对视觉编码器表示进行分解和重构，通过低秩张量火车分解（秩8-32）和低残差强度（α=0.1-0.2）来过滤对抗性噪声

Result: 在Flickr30K数据集上恢复了12.3%的性能损失，Recall@1准确率从7.5%提升到19.8%；在COCO数据集上恢复了8.1%的性能，准确率从3.8%提升到11.9%

Conclusion: 该方法是一种实用的即插即用解决方案，对现有视觉语言模型具有最小开销，能够有效防御对抗性攻击

Abstract: Vision language models (VLMs) excel in multimodal understanding but are prone
to adversarial attacks. Existing defenses often demand costly retraining or
significant architecture changes. We introduce a lightweight defense using
tensor decomposition suitable for any pre-trained VLM, requiring no retraining.
By decomposing and reconstructing vision encoder representations, it filters
adversarial noise while preserving meaning. Experiments with CLIP on COCO and
Flickr30K show improved robustness. On Flickr30K, it restores 12.3\%
performance lost to attacks, raising Recall@1 accuracy from 7.5\% to 19.8\%. On
COCO, it recovers 8.1\% performance, improving accuracy from 3.8\% to 11.9\%.
Analysis shows Tensor Train decomposition with low rank (8-32) and low residual
strength ($\alpha=0.1-0.2$) is optimal. This method is a practical,
plug-and-play solution with minimal overhead for existing VLMs.

TL;DR: 本文提出了首个将SAM2视觉基础模型适配到3D点云分割的range-view框架，通过架构改进优化SAM2在LiDAR距离图像上的性能，在保持2D流水线效率的同时实现了有竞争力的分割结果。


<details>

Motivation: 现有体素和点云方法计算成本高且实时性有限，而range-view方法可以利用成熟的2D分割技术实现快速准确预测。作者希望探索视觉基础模型（如SAM2）是否可以作为LiDAR点云分割的强大骨干网络。

Method: 提出了适配SAM2的range-view框架，包括三个主要架构改进：1）强调LiDAR距离图像水平空间依赖性的新模块；2）针对球面投影几何特性定制的配置；3）专门捕捉range-view伪图像空间模式和间断性的编码器机制。

Result: 在SemanticKITTI数据集上实现了有竞争力的性能，同时受益于2D流水线的速度、可扩展性和部署简便性。

Conclusion: 这项工作证明了视觉基础模型作为3D感知通用骨干网络的可行性，为统一的、基础模型驱动的LiDAR分割开辟了道路，使用VFMs的range-view分割方法显示出有前景的结果。

Abstract: Point cloud segmentation is central to autonomous driving and 3D scene
understanding. While voxel- and point-based methods dominate recent research
due to their compatibility with deep architectures and ability to capture
fine-grained geometry, they often incur high computational cost, irregular
memory access, and limited real-time efficiency. In contrast, range-view
methods, though relatively underexplored - can leverage mature 2D semantic
segmentation techniques for fast and accurate predictions. Motivated by the
rapid progress in Visual Foundation Models (VFMs) for captioning, zero-shot
recognition, and multimodal tasks, we investigate whether SAM2, the current
state-of-the-art VFM for segmentation tasks, can serve as a strong backbone for
LiDAR point cloud segmentation in the range view. We present , to our
knowledge, the first range-view framework that adapts SAM2 to 3D segmentation,
coupling efficient 2D feature extraction with standard
projection/back-projection to operate on point clouds. To optimize SAM2 for
range-view representations, we implement several architectural modifications to
the encoder: (1) a novel module that emphasizes horizontal spatial dependencies
inherent in LiDAR range images, (2) a customized configuration of tailored to
the geometric properties of spherical projections, and (3) an adapted mechanism
in the encoder backbone specifically designed to capture the unique spatial
patterns and discontinuities present in range-view pseudo-images. Our approach
achieves competitive performance on SemanticKITTI while benefiting from the
speed, scalability, and deployment simplicity of 2D-centric pipelines. This
work highlights the viability of VFMs as general-purpose backbones for 3D
perception and opens a path toward unified, foundation-model-driven LiDAR
segmentation. Results lets us conclude that range-view segmentation methods
using VFMs leads to promising results.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有迭代立体匹配方法在遮挡、纹理缺失或重复模式等病态区域表现不佳，缺乏全局上下文和几何信息进行有效迭代优化

Method: GREAT框架包含三个注意力模块：空间注意力(SA)捕捉空间维度的全局上下文，匹配注意力(MA)沿极线提取全局上下文，体积注意力(VA)与前两者协同构建更鲁棒的成本体积

Result: 在多个基准测试中取得领先成绩：Scene Flow测试集、KITTI 2015和ETH3D排行榜第一，Middlebury基准测试第二

Conclusion: GREAT框架能有效提升迭代立体匹配方法在挑战性病态区域的性能，具有通用性和有效性

Abstract: Stereo matching achieves significant progress with iterative algorithms like
RAFT-Stereo and IGEV-Stereo. However, these methods struggle in ill-posed
regions with occlusions, textureless, or repetitive patterns, due to a lack of
global context and geometric information for effective iterative refinement. To
enable the existing iterative approaches to incorporate global context, we
propose the Global Regulation and Excitation via Attention Tuning (GREAT)
framework which encompasses three attention modules. Specifically, Spatial
Attention (SA) captures the global context within the spatial dimension,
Matching Attention (MA) extracts global context along epipolar lines, and
Volume Attention (VA) works in conjunction with SA and MA to construct a more
robust cost-volume excited by global context and geometric details. To verify
the universality and effectiveness of this framework, we integrate it into
several representative iterative stereo-matching methods and validate it
through extensive experiments, collectively denoted as GREAT-Stereo. This
framework demonstrates superior performance in challenging ill-posed regions.
Applied to IGEV-Stereo, among all published methods, our GREAT-IGEV ranks first
on the Scene Flow test set, KITTI 2015, and ETH3D leaderboards, and achieves
second on the Middlebury benchmark. Code is available at

Conclusion: 结论是反馈机制在实现稳定、鲁棒和可泛化的学习中具有重要作用，DFMs为处理噪声和有限数据条件下的学习任务提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Deep Feedback Models (DFMs) are a new class of stateful neural networks that
combine bottom up input with high level representations over time. This
feedback mechanism introduces dynamics into otherwise static architectures,
enabling DFMs to iteratively refine their internal state and mimic aspects of
biological decision making. We model this process as a differential equation
solved through a recurrent neural network, stabilized via exponential decay to
ensure convergence. To evaluate their effectiveness, we measure DFMs under two
key conditions: robustness to noise and generalization with limited data. In
both object recognition and segmentation tasks, DFMs consistently outperform
their feedforward counterparts, particularly in low data or high noise regimes.
In addition, DFMs translate to medical imaging settings, while being robust
against various types of noise corruption. These findings highlight the
importance of feedback in achieving stable, robust, and generalizable learning.

Conclusion: 这种简单的流程建立了一个强大的基线，充分利用了2D相比3D更丰富的训练数据，为稀疏视角下的开词汇3D物体检测提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The ability to interpret and comprehend a 3D scene is essential for many
vision and robotics systems. In numerous applications, this involves 3D object
detection, i.e.~identifying the location and dimensions of objects belonging to
a specific category, typically represented as bounding boxes. This has
traditionally been solved by training to detect a fixed set of categories,
which limits its use. In this work, we investigate open-vocabulary 3D object
detection in the challenging yet practical sparse-view setting, where only a
limited number of posed RGB images are available as input. Our approach is
training-free, relying on pre-trained, off-the-shelf 2D foundation models
instead of employing computationally expensive 3D feature fusion or requiring
3D-specific learning. By lifting 2D detections and directly optimizing 3D
proposals for featuremetric consistency across views, we fully leverage the
extensive training data available in 2D compared to 3D. Through standard
benchmarks, we demonstrate that this simple pipeline establishes a powerful
baseline, performing competitively with state-of-the-art techniques in densely
sampled scenarios while significantly outperforming them in the sparse-view
setting.

Abstract: Camera-radar fusion offers a robust and low-cost alternative to Camera-lidar
fusion for the 3D object detection task in real-time under adverse weather and
lighting conditions. However, currently, in the literature, it is possible to
find few works focusing on this modality and, most importantly, developing new
architectures to explore the advantages of the radar point cloud, such as
accurate distance estimation and speed information. Therefore, this work
presents a novel and efficient 3D object detection algorithm using cameras and
radars in the bird's-eye-view (BEV). Our algorithm exploits the advantages of
radar before fusing the features into a detection head. A new backbone is
introduced, which maps the radar pillar features into an embedded dimension. A
self-attention mechanism allows the backbone to model the dependencies between
the radar points. We are using a simplified convolutional layer to replace the
FPN-based convolutional layers used in the PointPillars-based architectures
with the main goal of reducing inference time. Our results show that with this
modification, our approach achieves the new state-of-the-art in the 3D object
detection problem, reaching 58.2 of the NDS metric for the use of ResNet-50,
while also setting a new benchmark for inference time on the nuScenes dataset
for the same category.

Abstract: Precise yield prediction is essential for agricultural sustainability and
food security. However, climate change complicates accurate yield prediction by
affecting major factors such as weather conditions, soil fertility, and farm
management systems. Advances in technology have played an essential role in
overcoming these challenges by leveraging satellite monitoring and data
analysis for precise yield estimation. Current methods rely on spatio-temporal
data for predicting crop yield, but they often struggle with multi-spectral
data, which is crucial for evaluating crop health and growth patterns. To
resolve this challenge, we propose a novel Multi-Temporal Multi-Spectral Yield
Prediction Network, MTMS-YieldNet, that integrates spectral data with
spatio-temporal information to effectively capture the correlations and
dependencies between them. While existing methods that rely on pre-trained
models trained on general visual data, MTMS-YieldNet utilizes contrastive
learning for feature discrimination during pre-training, focusing on capturing
spatial-spectral patterns and spatio-temporal dependencies from remote sensing
data. Both quantitative and qualitative assessments highlight the excellence of
the proposed MTMS-YieldNet over seven existing state-of-the-art methods.
MTMS-YieldNet achieves MAPE scores of 0.336 on Sentinel-1, 0.353 on Landsat-8,
and an outstanding 0.331 on Sentinel-2, demonstrating effective yield
prediction performance across diverse climatic and seasonal conditions. The
outstanding performance of MTMS-YieldNet improves yield predictions and
provides valuable insights that can assist farmers in making better decisions,

Abstract: Recently, data-driven trajectory prediction methods have achieved remarkable
results, significantly advancing the development of autonomous driving.
However, the instability of single-vehicle perception introduces certain

early fusion on multi-source trajectory data from vehicles and road
infrastructure, enabling the trajectories with high completeness and accuracy.
The PTA module can efficiently capture potential interaction information among
historical trajectories, and the mode attention module is proposed to enrich
the diversity of predictions. Additionally, the decoder based on sparse anchors
is designed to generate the final complete trajectories. Extensive experiments
show that CoPAD achieves the state-of-the-art performance on the DAIR-V2X-Seq
dataset, validating the effectiveness of the model in cooperative trajectory
prediction in V2X scenarios.

TL;DR: MuproCL是一个新颖的视觉持续学习框架，通过使用多个上下文感知原型替代单一语义目标，解决了语义歧义和类内视觉多样性的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的语言引导监督方法依赖单一PLM目标存在两个关键限制：1）语义歧义性，多义词类别名称导致冲突的视觉表示；2）类内视觉多样性，单一原型无法捕捉类内丰富的视觉外观变化。

Method: 使用轻量级LLM代理进行类别消歧和视觉模态扩展，生成鲁棒的语义原型集。采用LogSumExp聚合机制，使视觉模型能够自适应地与给定图像最相关的原型对齐。

Result: 在各种持续学习基准上的广泛实验表明，MuproCL能够持续提升性能和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: MuproCL为语言引导的持续学习建立了更有效的路径，通过多原型方法解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Language-guided supervision, which utilizes a frozen semantic target from a
Pretrained Language Model (PLM), has emerged as a promising paradigm for visual
Continual Learning (CL). However, relying on a single target introduces two
critical limitations: 1) semantic ambiguity, where a polysemous category name
results in conflicting visual representations, and 2) intra-class visual
diversity, where a single prototype fails to capture the rich variety of visual
appearances within a class. To this end, we propose MuproCL, a novel framework
that replaces the single target with multiple, context-aware prototypes.
Specifically, we employ a lightweight LLM agent to perform category
disambiguation and visual-modal expansion to generate a robust set of semantic
prototypes. A LogSumExp aggregation mechanism allows the vision model to
adaptively align with the most relevant prototype for a given image. Extensive
experiments across various CL baselines demonstrate that MuproCL consistently
enhances performance and robustness, establishing a more effective path for
language-guided continual learning.

Motivation: 多模态图像匹配由于模态间显著的外观差异而具有挑战性，现有深度学习方法因高质量标注数据稀缺而性能不佳且缺乏适应性。

Method: 使用知识蒸馏构建轻量级学生模型，从VFM提取高层语义特征辅助匹配；注入模态类别信息增强跨模态相关性理解；设计V2I-GAN进行数据增强。

Result: 在公开数据集上的实验表明，DistillMatch方法优于现有算法。

Conclusion: 利用视觉基础模型的知识蒸馏能够有效解决多模态图像匹配问题，提高模型的泛化能力和性能。

Abstract: Multimodal image matching seeks pixel-level correspondences between images of
different modalities, crucial for cross-modal perception, fusion and analysis.
However, the significant appearance differences between modalities make this
task challenging. Due to the scarcity of high-quality annotated datasets,
existing deep learning methods that extract modality-common features for
matching perform poorly and lack adaptability to diverse scenarios. Vision
Foundation Model (VFM), trained on large-scale data, yields generalizable and
robust feature representations adapted to data and tasks of various modalities,
including multimodal matching. Thus, we propose DistillMatch, a multimodal
image matching method using knowledge distillation from VFM. DistillMatch
employs knowledge distillation to build a lightweight student model that
extracts high-level semantic features from VFM (including DINOv2 and DINOv3) to
assist matching across modalities. To retain modality-specific information, it
extracts and injects modality category information into the other modality's
features, which enhances the model's understanding of cross-modal correlations.
Furthermore, we design V2I-GAN to boost the model's generalization by
translating visible to pseudo-infrared images for data augmentation.
Experiments show that DistillMatch outperforms existing algorithms on public
datasets.

Motivation: 现实场景中多视图数据往往只有部分对齐，而现有方法依赖完全对齐假设，导致性能下降。

Method: 采用因果建模方法，将部分对齐数据视为干预，设计变分自编码器进行因果学习，包含编码器估计不变特征和解码器进行干预后推理，并加入对比正则化器。

Result: 在完全和部分对齐数据上的实验表明CauMVC具有强泛化能力和有效性。

Conclusion: 这是首个通过因果学习处理广义多视图聚类的工作，为解决部分对齐数据聚类问题提供了新思路。

Abstract: Multi-view clustering (MVC) aims to explore the common clustering structure
across multiple views. Many existing MVC methods heavily rely on the assumption
of view consistency, where alignments for corresponding samples across
different views are ordered in advance. However, real-world scenarios often
present a challenge as only partial data is consistently aligned across
different views, restricting the overall clustering performance. In this work,
we consider the model performance decreasing phenomenon caused by data order
shift (i.e., from fully to partially aligned) as a generalized multi-view
clustering problem. To tackle this problem, we design a causal multi-view
clustering network, termed CauMVC. We adopt a causal modeling approach to
understand multi-view clustering procedure. To be specific, we formulate the
partially aligned data as an intervention and multi-view clustering with
partially aligned data as an post-intervention inference. However, obtaining
invariant features directly can be challenging. Thus, we design a Variational
Auto-Encoder for causal learning by incorporating an encoder from existing
information to estimate the invariant features. Moreover, a decoder is designed
to perform the post-intervention inference. Lastly, we design a contrastive
regularizer to capture sample correlations. To the best of our knowledge, this
paper is the first work to deal generalized multi-view clustering via causal
learning. Empirical experiments on both fully and partially aligned data
illustrate the strong generalization and effectiveness of CauMVC.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的VSR方法对现实世界中的视觉挑战关注有限，如光照变化、遮挡、模糊和姿态变化。这些挑战影响了VSR的鲁棒性。

Method: GLip采用双路径特征提取架构，集成全局和局部特征，分为两个阶段：第一阶段学习视觉特征与语音单元的粗对齐；第二阶段通过上下文增强模块（CEM）动态整合局部特征与全局上下文，细化视觉-语音映射。

Result: GLip在LRS2和LRS3基准测试中 consistently 优于现有方法，并在新引入的具有挑战性的普通话数据集上验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: GLip通过渐进学习策略有效利用判别性局部区域，增强了对抗各种视觉挑战的鲁棒性，为VSR提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Visual speech recognition (VSR), also known as lip reading, is the task of
recognizing speech from silent video. Despite significant advancements in VSR
over recent decades, most existing methods pay limited attention to real-world
visual challenges such as illumination variations, occlusions, blurring, and
pose changes. To address these challenges, we propose GLip, a Global-Local
Integrated Progressive framework designed for robust VSR. GLip is built upon
two key insights: (i) learning an initial \textit{coarse} alignment between
visual features across varying conditions and corresponding speech content
facilitates the subsequent learning of \textit{precise} visual-to-speech
mappings in challenging environments; (ii) under adverse conditions, certain
local regions (e.g., non-occluded areas) often exhibit more discriminative cues
for lip reading than global features. To this end, GLip introduces a dual-path
feature extraction architecture that integrates both global and local features
within a two-stage progressive learning framework. In the first stage, the
model learns to align both global and local visual features with corresponding
acoustic speech units using easily accessible audio-visual data, establishing a
coarse yet semantically robust foundation. In the second stage, we introduce a
Contextual Enhancement Module (CEM) to dynamically integrate local features
with relevant global context across both spatial and temporal dimensions,
refining the coarse representations into precise visual-speech mappings. Our
framework uniquely exploits discriminative local regions through a progressive
learning strategy, demonstrating enhanced robustness against various visual
challenges and consistently outperforming existing methods on the LRS2 and LRS3
benchmarks. We further validate its effectiveness on a newly introduced
challenging Mandarin dataset.

Motivation: 现实世界点云数据存在噪声，现有数据驱动方法严重依赖真实法向量或近似法向量计算，对噪声点云不可靠。B样条重建技术虽然能提供紧凑的表面表示，但现有方法固定控制点数量难以匹配底层表面的复杂性。

Method: 开发字典引导图卷积网络，同时预测控制点的位置和数量，无需使用点法向量，直接处理噪声点云数据。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效处理噪声点云数据，生成平滑表面，在表面重建任务中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Generating continuous surfaces from discrete point cloud data is a
fundamental task in several 3D vision applications. Real-world point clouds are
inherently noisy due to various technical and environmental factors. Existing
data-driven surface reconstruction algorithms rely heavily on ground truth
normals or compute approximate normals as an intermediate step. This dependency
makes them extremely unreliable for noisy point cloud datasets, even if the
availability of ground truth training data is ensured, which is not always the
case. B-spline reconstruction techniques provide compact surface
representations of point clouds and are especially known for their smoothening
properties. However, the complexity of the surfaces approximated using
B-splines is directly influenced by the number and location of the spline
control points. Existing spline-based modeling methods predict the locations of
a fixed number of control points for a given point cloud, which makes it very
difficult to match the complexity of its underlying surface. In this work, we
develop a Dictionary-Guided Graph Convolutional Network-based surface
reconstruction strategy where we simultaneously predict both the location and
the number of control points for noisy point cloud data to generate smooth
surfaces without the use of any point normals. We compare our reconstruction
method with several well-known as well as recent baselines by employing
widely-used evaluation metrics, and demonstrate that our method outperforms all
of them both qualitatively and quantitatively.

Result: 定量和定性实验证明该方法在群体活动检测任务上具有优越性能

Conclusion: LIR-GAD框架通过语言指导推理有效提升了群体活动检测的性能和可解释性

Abstract: Group activity detection (GAD) aims to simultaneously identify group members
and categorize their collective activities within video sequences. Existing
deep learning-based methods develop specialized architectures (e.g.,
transformer networks) to model the dynamics of individual roles and semantic
dependencies between individuals and groups. However, they rely solely on
implicit pattern recognition from visual features and struggle with contextual
reasoning and explainability. In this work, we propose LIR-GAD, a novel
framework of language-instructed reasoning for GAD via Multimodal Large
Language Model (MLLM). Our approach expand the original vocabulary of MLLM by
introducing an activity-level <ACT> token and multiple cluster-specific <GROUP>
tokens. We process video frames alongside two specially designed tokens and
language instructions, which are then integrated into the MLLM. The pretrained
commonsense knowledge embedded in the MLLM enables the <ACT> token and <GROUP>
tokens to effectively capture the semantic information of collective activities
and learn distinct representational features of different groups, respectively.
Also, we introduce a multi-label classification loss to further enhance the
<ACT> token's ability to learn discriminative semantic representations. Then,
we design a Multimodal Dual-Alignment Fusion (MDAF) module that integrates
MLLM's hidden embeddings corresponding to the designed tokens with visual
features, significantly enhancing the performance of GAD. Both quantitative and
qualitative experiments demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed
method in GAD taks.

Motivation: 解决盲点网络在图像去噪中因空间独立性假设导致的局部细节丢失和像素不连续问题，同时克服扩散模型在自监督去噪中的适应困难。

Method: 采用双分支扩散框架：一个基于盲点网络的扩散分支生成半干净图像，另一个传统扩散分支捕捉噪声分布。使用盲点网络分支指导采样过程，在保持局部细节的同时捕捉噪声结构。

Result: 在SIDD和DND数据集上的大量实验表明，该方法达到了最先进的性能，成为真实世界去噪的高效自监督解决方案。

Conclusion: Blind-Spot Guided Diffusion框架有效结合了盲点网络和扩散模型的优势，为自监督真实世界图像去噪提供了创新解决方案，代码和预训练模型已开源。

Abstract: In this work, we present Blind-Spot Guided Diffusion, a novel self-supervised
framework for real-world image denoising. Our approach addresses two major
challenges: the limitations of blind-spot networks (BSNs), which often
sacrifice local detail and introduce pixel discontinuities due to spatial
independence assumptions, and the difficulty of adapting diffusion models to
self-supervised denoising. We propose a dual-branch diffusion framework that
combines a BSN-based diffusion branch, generating semi-clean images, with a
conventional diffusion branch that captures underlying noise distributions. To
enable effective training without paired data, we use the BSN-based branch to
guide the sampling process, capturing noise structure while preserving local
details. Extensive experiments on the SIDD and DND datasets demonstrate
state-of-the-art performance, establishing our method as a highly effective
self-supervised solution for real-world denoising. Code and pre-trained models

Motivation: 多智能体体育场景中的轨迹预测面临智能体角色异构性和不同体育领域动态分布差异的挑战，现有统一框架难以捕捉这些结构化分布变化。

Method: 提出AdaSports-Traj框架，包含角色和领域感知适配器来条件调整潜在表示，并引入分层对比学习目标分别监督角色敏感和领域感知表示。

Result: 在Basketball-U、Football-U和Soccer-U三个体育数据集上的实验表明，该框架在统一和跨域轨迹预测设置中均取得优异性能。

Conclusion: AdaSports-Traj通过自适应设计有效解决了体育场景中轨迹预测的分布差异问题，具有很好的泛化能力。

Abstract: Trajectory prediction in multi-agent sports scenarios is inherently
challenging due to the structural heterogeneity across agent roles (e.g.,
players vs. ball) and dynamic distribution gaps across different sports
domains. Existing unified frameworks often fail to capture these structured
distributional shifts, resulting in suboptimal generalization across roles and
domains. We propose AdaSports-Traj, an adaptive trajectory modeling framework
that explicitly addresses both intra-domain and inter-domain distribution
discrepancies in sports. At its core, AdaSports-Traj incorporates a Role- and
Domain-Aware Adapter to conditionally adjust latent representations based on
agent identity and domain context. Additionally, we introduce a Hierarchical
Contrastive Learning objective, which separately supervises role-sensitive and
domain-aware representations to encourage disentangled latent structures
without introducing optimization conflict. Experiments on three diverse sports
datasets, Basketball-U, Football-U, and Soccer-U, demonstrate the effectiveness
of our adaptive design, achieving strong performance in both unified and
cross-domain trajectory prediction settings.

TL;DR: SegDINO3D是一个新颖的Transformer编码器-解码器框架，用于3D实例分割，通过利用预训练的2D检测模型的2D表示来提升3D表示性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于3D训练数据通常不如2D训练图像充足，SegDINO3D旨在充分利用预训练2D检测模型的2D表示（包括图像级和对象级特征）来改进3D表示。

Method: SegDINO3D同时输入点云和相关的2D图像。编码器阶段通过从对应图像视图中检索2D图像特征来丰富每个3D点，然后使用3D编码器进行3D上下文融合。解码器阶段将3D对象查询表示为3D锚框，并执行从3D查询到使用2D检测模型从2D图像获得的2D对象查询的交叉注意力。

Result: SegDINO3D在ScanNetV2和ScanNet200 3D实例分割基准测试中达到了最先进的性能。在具有挑战性的ScanNet200数据集上，SegDINO3D在验证集和隐藏测试集上分别显著优于先前方法+8.7和+6.8 mAP。

Conclusion: SegDINO3D通过有效利用2D表示来增强3D实例分割，展示了其在处理3D数据不足问题上的优越性，并在基准测试中取得了显著性能提升。

Abstract: In this paper, we present SegDINO3D, a novel Transformer encoder-decoder
framework for 3D instance segmentation. As 3D training data is generally not as
sufficient as 2D training images, SegDINO3D is designed to fully leverage 2D
representation from a pre-trained 2D detection model, including both
image-level and object-level features, for improving 3D representation.
SegDINO3D takes both a point cloud and its associated 2D images as input. In
the encoder stage, it first enriches each 3D point by retrieving 2D image
features from its corresponding image views and then leverages a 3D encoder for
3D context fusion. In the decoder stage, it formulates 3D object queries as 3D
anchor boxes and performs cross-attention from 3D queries to 2D object queries
obtained from 2D images using the 2D detection model. These 2D object queries
serve as a compact object-level representation of 2D images, effectively
avoiding the challenge of keeping thousands of image feature maps in the memory
while faithfully preserving the knowledge of the pre-trained 2D model. The
introducing of 3D box queries also enables the model to modulate
cross-attention using the predicted boxes for more precise querying. SegDINO3D
achieves the state-of-the-art performance on the ScanNetV2 and ScanNet200 3D
instance segmentation benchmarks. Notably, on the challenging ScanNet200
dataset, SegDINO3D significantly outperforms prior methods by +8.7 and +6.8 mAP
on the validation and hidden test sets, respectively, demonstrating its
superiority.

Conclusion: RadarGaussianDet3D通过高斯表示方法有效解决了4D雷达检测中的特征稀疏和优化不一致问题，在精度和速度方面均优于现有方法，具有实际部署价值。

Abstract: 4D automotive radars have gained increasing attention for autonomous driving
due to their low cost, robustness, and inherent velocity measurement
capability. However, existing 4D radar-based 3D detectors rely heavily on
pillar encoders for BEV feature extraction, where each point contributes to
only a single BEV grid, resulting in sparse feature maps and degraded
representation quality. In addition, they also optimize bounding box attributes
independently, leading to sub-optimal detection accuracy. Moreover, their
inference speed, while sufficient for high-end GPUs, may fail to meet the
real-time requirement on vehicle-mounted embedded devices. To overcome these
limitations, an efficient and effective Gaussian-based 3D detector, namely
RadarGaussianDet3D is introduced, leveraging Gaussian primitives and
distributions as intermediate representations for radar points and bounding
boxes. In RadarGaussianDet3D, a novel Point Gaussian Encoder (PGE) is designed
to transform each point into a Gaussian primitive after feature aggregation and
employs the 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) technique for BEV rasterization,
yielding denser feature maps. PGE exhibits exceptionally low latency, owing to
the optimized algorithm for point feature aggregation and fast rendering of
3DGS. In addition, a new Box Gaussian Loss (BGL) is proposed, which converts
bounding boxes into 3D Gaussian distributions and measures their distance to
enable more comprehensive and consistent optimization. Extensive experiments on
TJ4DRadSet and View-of-Delft demonstrate that RadarGaussianDet3D achieves
state-of-the-art detection accuracy while delivering substantially faster
inference, highlighting its potential for real-time deployment in autonomous
driving.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has made
aligning them with human preferences a critical challenge. Reward Models (RMs)
are a core technology for achieving this goal, but a systematic guide for
building state-of-the-art Multimodal Reward Models (MRMs) is currently lacking
in both academia and industry. Through exhaustive experimental analysis, this
paper aims to provide a clear ``recipe'' for constructing high-performance
MRMs. We systematically investigate every crucial component in the MRM
development pipeline, including \textit{reward modeling paradigms} (e.g.,
Naive-RM, Critic-based RM, and Generative RM), \textit{reward head
architecture}, \textit{training strategies}, \textit{data curation} (covering
over ten multimodal and text-only preference datasets), \textit{backbone model}
and \textit{model scale}, and \textit{ensemble methods}.
  Based on these experimental insights, we introduce \textbf{BaseReward}, a
powerful and efficient baseline for multimodal reward modeling. BaseReward
adopts a simple yet effective architecture, built upon a {Qwen2.5-VL} backbone,
featuring an optimized two-layer reward head, and is trained on a carefully
curated mixture of high-quality multimodal and text-only preference data. Our
results show that BaseReward establishes a new SOTA on major benchmarks such as
MM-RLHF-Reward Bench, VL-Reward Bench, and Multimodal Reward Bench,
outperforming previous models. Furthermore, to validate its practical utility
beyond static benchmarks, we integrate BaseReward into a real-world
reinforcement learning pipeline, successfully enhancing an MLLM's performance
across various perception, reasoning, and conversational tasks. This work not
only delivers a top-tier MRM but, more importantly, provides the community with
a clear, empirically-backed guide for developing robust reward models for the
next generation of MLLMs.

Abstract: We aim to recover the geometry of 3D parametric scenes using very few depth
measurements from low-cost, commercially available time-of-flight sensors.
These sensors offer very low spatial resolution (i.e., a single pixel), but
image a wide field-of-view per pixel and capture detailed time-of-flight data
in the form of time-resolved photon counts. This time-of-flight data encodes
rich scene information and thus enables recovery of simple scenes from sparse
measurements. We investigate the feasibility of using a distributed set of few
measurements (e.g., as few as 15 pixels) to recover the geometry of simple
parametric scenes with a strong prior, such as estimating the 6D pose of a
known object. To achieve this, we design a method that utilizes both
feed-forward prediction to infer scene parameters, and differentiable rendering
within an analysis-by-synthesis framework to refine the scene parameter
estimate. We develop hardware prototypes and demonstrate that our method
effectively recovers object pose given an untextured 3D model in both
simulations and controlled real-world captures, and show promising initial
results for other parametric scenes. We additionally conduct experiments to
explore the limits and capabilities of our imaging solution.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文介绍了AcT2I基准，用于评估文本到图像模型在生成动作中心提示的图像时的性能，并提出了一种利用大型语言模型的知识蒸馏技术来增强提示信息，显著提升图像生成准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前文本到图像模型在渲染复杂动作和交互场景时存在困难，经常无法捕捉动作描绘中的细微和隐含属性，导致生成的图像缺乏关键上下文细节。

Method: 开发了训练免费的知识蒸馏技术，利用大型语言模型增强提示信息，特别关注时间维度的细节注入，通过三个维度密集信息整合来改进提示。

Result: 实验验证显示主流T2I模型在AcT2I基准上表现不佳，但通过提出的方法，最佳模型实现了72%的图像生成准确性提升，时间细节的注入对改进效果最为显著。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了当前T2I方法在需要复杂推理的图像生成任务中的局限性，并证明通过系统整合语言知识可以显著提升生成图像的细微性和上下文准确性。

Abstract: Text-to-Image (T2I) models have recently achieved remarkable success in
generating images from textual descriptions. However, challenges still persist
in accurately rendering complex scenes where actions and interactions form the
primary semantic focus. Our key observation in this work is that T2I models
frequently struggle to capture nuanced and often implicit attributes inherent
in action depiction, leading to generating images that lack key contextual
details. To enable systematic evaluation, we introduce AcT2I, a benchmark
designed to evaluate the performance of T2I models in generating images from
action-centric prompts. We experimentally validate that leading T2I models do
not fare well on AcT2I. We further hypothesize that this shortcoming arises
from the incomplete representation of the inherent attributes and contextual
dependencies in the training corpora of existing T2I models. We build upon this
by developing a training-free, knowledge distillation technique utilizing Large
Language Models to address this limitation. Specifically, we enhance prompts by
incorporating dense information across three dimensions, observing that
injecting prompts with temporal details significantly improves image generation
accuracy, with our best model achieving an increase of 72%. Our findings
highlight the limitations of current T2I methods in generating images that
require complex reasoning and demonstrate that integrating linguistic knowledge
in a systematic way can notably advance the generation of nuanced and
contextually accurate images.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文发现多模态大语言模型在处理图像输入时表现出明显的视觉谄媚行为，即过度迎合用户的误导性指令。作者提出了Sycophantic Reflective Tuning（SRT）方法，通过让模型进行反思推理来缓解这一问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在基于图像输入的对话中表现出比文本模型更明显的视觉谄媚行为，这种谄媚模态间隙需要被理解和解决。

Method: 首先尝试了简单的监督微调，但发现会导致模型过度固执。随后提出了Sycophantic Reflective Tuning（SRT）方法，让模型在得出结论前进行反思推理，判断用户指令是误导性还是纠正性的。

Result: 应用SRT后，模型对误导性指令的谄媚行为显著减少，同时不会对纠正性指令表现出过度固执。

Conclusion: SRT方法有效缓解了多模态大语言模型的视觉谄媚行为，在保持对纠正性指令开放性的同时减少了对误导性指令的过度迎合。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have demonstrated extraordinary
capabilities in conducting conversations based on image inputs. However, we
observe that MLLMs exhibit a pronounced form of visual sycophantic behavior.
While similar behavior has also been noted in text-based large language models
(LLMs), it becomes significantly more prominent when MLLMs process image
inputs. We refer to this phenomenon as the "sycophantic modality gap." To
better understand this issue, we further analyze the factors that contribute to
the exacerbation of this gap. To mitigate the visual sycophantic behavior, we
first experiment with naive supervised fine-tuning to help the MLLM resist
misleading instructions from the user. However, we find that this approach also
makes the MLLM overly resistant to corrective instructions (i.e., stubborn even
if it is wrong). To alleviate this trade-off, we propose Sycophantic Reflective
Tuning (SRT), which enables the MLLM to engage in reflective reasoning,
allowing it to determine whether a user's instruction is misleading or
corrective before drawing a conclusion. After applying SRT, we observe a
significant reduction in sycophantic behavior toward misleading instructions,
without resulting in excessive stubbornness when receiving corrective
instructions.

TL;DR: UniMRSeg提出了一种统一的多模态图像分割网络，通过分层自监督补偿机制解决实际部署中模态缺失/损坏的问题，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态图像分割在实际部署中面临模态不完整/损坏导致性能下降的挑战。现有方法需要为每种模态组合训练专门模型，导致部署成本高昂。

Method: 采用分层自监督补偿（HSSC）方法：1）混合随机掩码增强的模态重建学习模态内在特征；2）模态不变对比学习补偿特征空间距离；3）轻量级反向注意力适配器补偿弱感知语义；4）混合一致性约束微调确保稳定预测。

Result: UniMRSeg在多种模态缺失场景下（MRI脑肿瘤分割、RGB-D语义分割、RGB-D/T显著目标分割）显著优于最先进方法。

Conclusion: 该方法实现了统一的模态松弛分割网络，无需为不同模态组合训练专门模型，大幅降低了部署成本，同时保持了优异的性能。

Abstract: Multi-modal image segmentation faces real-world deployment challenges from
incomplete/corrupted modalities degrading performance. While existing methods
address training-inference modality gaps via specialized per-combination
models, they introduce high deployment costs by requiring exhaustive model
subsets and model-modality matching. In this work, we propose a unified
modality-relax segmentation network (UniMRSeg) through hierarchical
self-supervised compensation (HSSC). Our approach hierarchically bridges
representation gaps between complete and incomplete modalities across input,
feature and output levels. % First, we adopt modality reconstruction with the
hybrid shuffled-masking augmentation, encouraging the model to learn the
intrinsic modality characteristics and generate meaningful representations for
missing modalities through cross-modal fusion. % Next, modality-invariant
contrastive learning implicitly compensates the feature space distance among
incomplete-complete modality pairs. Furthermore, the proposed lightweight
reverse attention adapter explicitly compensates for the weak perceptual
semantics in the frozen encoder. Last, UniMRSeg is fine-tuned under the hybrid
consistency constraint to ensure stable prediction under all modality
combinations without large performance fluctuations. Without bells and
whistles, UniMRSeg significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods under
diverse missing modality scenarios on MRI-based brain tumor segmentation, RGB-D
semantic segmentation, RGB-D/T salient object segmentation. The code will be
released at https://github.com/Xiaoqi-Zhao-DLUT/UniMRSeg.

Motivation: 现有的开源多模态模型在图像理解和生成能力之间存在性能权衡，需要一种能够同时兼顾两种能力的统一框架。

Method: 使用共享视觉编码器配合两个轻量级适配器，分别生成用于图像理解的连续嵌入和用于图像生成的离散标记。采用统一的自回归LLM预测文本和图像标记，配合辅助扩散解码器将图像标记转换为像素。

Result: Manzano在统一模型中达到最先进水平，在文本丰富的评估中与专业模型竞争力相当。研究表明任务冲突最小，模型规模扩展带来一致收益。

Conclusion: 混合分词器的设计选择得到验证，该框架为多模态理解和生成提供了可扩展的联合学习方案。

Abstract: Unified multimodal Large Language Models (LLMs) that can both understand and
generate visual content hold immense potential. However, existing open-source
models often suffer from a performance trade-off between these capabilities. We
present Manzano, a simple and scalable unified framework that substantially
reduces this tension by coupling a hybrid image tokenizer with a well-curated
training recipe. A single shared vision encoder feeds two lightweight adapters
that produce continuous embeddings for image-to-text understanding and discrete
tokens for text-to-image generation within a common semantic space. A unified
autoregressive LLM predicts high-level semantics in the form of text and image
tokens, with an auxiliary diffusion decoder subsequently translating the image
tokens into pixels. The architecture, together with a unified training recipe
over understanding and generation data, enables scalable joint learning of both
capabilities. Manzano achieves state-of-the-art results among unified models,
and is competitive with specialist models, particularly on text-rich
evaluation. Our studies show minimal task conflicts and consistent gains from
scaling model size, validating our design choice of a hybrid tokenizer.

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 本文系统回顾了68项跨学科研究，分析了建成环境如何影响骑行体验，识别了宏观和微观两个分析尺度，发现当前研究过度依赖客观指标而忽视主观体验，特别是在历史城市中需要更关注街道景观作为生活环境的角色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解建成环境如何塑造人类体验对于设计可持续城市至关重要。骑行提供了关键案例，但其使用不仅取决于基础设施，更取决于骑行体验。当前研究存在碎片化问题，尤其在历史城市中需要更全面地考虑心理、生理和感知因素。

Method: 系统回顾了68项来自城市规划、交通、行为科学、神经科学和公共卫生等领域的研究，识别了两个分析尺度（宏观和微观）并将方法分类为客观、主观和混合方法。

Result: 研究发现当前研究持续依赖客观代理指标，主观描述的整合有限，对街道景观作为生活环境的关注不足。识别了宏观尺度（骑行能力）和微观尺度（骑行倾向）的分析框架。

Conclusion: 解决这些研究空白对于解释环境为何促进或阻碍骑行至关重要，有助于设计既支持出行又重视生活体验的骑行友好城市，特别是在历史城市背景下需要更综合的方法。

Abstract: Understanding how built environments shape human experience is central to
designing sustainable cities. Cycling provides a critical case: it delivers
health and environmental benefits, yet its uptake depends strongly on the
experience of cycling rather than infrastructure alone. Research on this
relationship has grown rapidly but remains fragmented across disciplines and
scales, and has concentrated on network-level analyses of routes and
connectivity. This bias is especially problematic in historical cities, where
embedding new infrastructure is difficult, and where cycling experience is
shaped not only by spatial form but also by how cyclists perceive, interpret,
and physically respond to their environment - through psychological factors
such as safety and comfort, physiological demands such as stress and fatigue,
and perceptual cues in the streetscape. We systematically reviewed 68 studies
across urban planning, transportation, behavioural science, neuroscience, and
public health. Two scales of analysis were identified: a macro scale addressing
the ability to cycle and a micro scale addressing the propensity to cycle.
Methods were classified into objective and subjective approaches, with hybrid
approaches beginning to emerge. We find a persistent reliance on objective
proxies, limited integration of subjective accounts, and insufficient attention
to the streetscape as a lived environment. Addressing these gaps is essential
to explain why environments enable or deter cycling, and to inform the design
of cities that support cycling as both mobility and lived experience.

Abstract: Despite recent advancements in Multilingual Information Retrieval (MLIR), a
significant gap remains between research and practical deployment. Many studies
assess MLIR performance in isolated settings, limiting their applicability to
real-world scenarios. In this work, we leverage the unique characteristics of
the Quranic multilingual corpus to examine the optimal strategies to develop an
ad-hoc IR system for the Islamic domain that is designed to satisfy users'
information needs in multiple languages. We prepared eleven retrieval models
employing four training approaches: monolingual, cross-lingual,
translate-train-all, and a novel mixed method combining cross-lingual and
monolingual techniques. Evaluation on an in-domain dataset demonstrates that
the mixed approach achieves promising results across diverse retrieval
scenarios. Furthermore, we provide a detailed analysis of how different
training configurations affect the embedding space and their implications for
multilingual retrieval effectiveness. Finally, we discuss deployment
considerations, emphasizing the cost-efficiency of deploying a single
versatile, lightweight model for real-world MLIR applications.

Motivation: 重新审视零样本方法，避免计算密集的文本-图像对比训练，利用预训练视觉语言模型作为可重用的语义代理。

Method: 使用视觉语言模型为每个文档图像生成详细文本描述，然后用标准文本编码器进行嵌入，实现文档检索。

Result: 在ViDoRe-v2基准测试中达到63.4% nDCG@5，优于专用多向量视觉文档编码器，且在大规模集合上扩展性更好，多语言覆盖更广。

Conclusion: 现代视觉语言模型能够以足够细粒度捕捉复杂文本和视觉线索，通过将模态对齐卸载给预训练模型，为未来VDR系统建立了强大的零样本基线。

Abstract: Visual Document Retrieval (VDR) typically operates as text-to-image retrieval
using specialized bi-encoders trained to directly embed document images. We
revisit a zero-shot generate-and-encode pipeline: a vision-language model first
produces a detailed textual description of each document image, which is then
embedded by a standard text encoder. On the ViDoRe-v2 benchmark, the method
reaches 63.4% nDCG@5, surpassing the strongest specialised multi-vector visual
document encoder. It also scales better to large collections and offers broader
multilingual coverage. Analysis shows that modern vision-language models
capture complex textual and visual cues with sufficient granularity to act as a
reusable semantic proxy. By offloading modality alignment to pretrained
vision-language models, our approach removes the need for computationally
intensive text-image contrastive training and establishes a strong zero-shot
baseline for future VDR systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的LCD视觉刺激范式在实际部署中存在局限性，需要开发更有效的刺激装置来提升脑机接口系统的性能。

Method: 开发LED基双重刺激装置，使用7Hz、8Hz、9Hz、10Hz四个频率对应不同方向控制，通过最大FFT幅度和P300峰值检测进行实时特征提取。

Result: 刺激硬件频率偏差仅为0.15%-0.20%，系统成功区分所有四个刺激频率并与相应P300事件标记关联，平均分类准确率达86.25%。

Conclusion: LED基混合系统在SSVEP分类准确性方面表现出色，为脑机接口应用提供了更实用的解决方案。

Abstract: In brain-computer interface (BCI) systems, steady-state visual evoked
potentials (SSVEP) and P300 responses have achieved widespread implementation
owing to their superior information transfer rates (ITR) and minimal training
requirements. These neurophysiological signals have exhibited robust efficacy
and versatility in external device control, demonstrating enhanced precision
and scalability. However, conventional implementations predominantly utilise
liquid crystal display (LCD)-based visual stimulation paradigms, which present
limitations in practical deployment scenarios. This investigation presents the
development and evaluation of a novel light-emitting diode (LED)-based dual
stimulation apparatus designed to enhance SSVEP classification accuracy through
the integration of both SSVEP and P300 paradigms. The system employs four
distinct frequencies, 7 Hz, 8 Hz, 9 Hz, and 10 Hz, corresponding to forward,
backward, right, and left directional controls, respectively. Oscilloscopic
verification confirmed the precision of these stimulation frequencies.
Real-time feature extraction was accomplished through the concurrent analysis
of maximum Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) amplitude and P300 peak detection to
ascertain user intent. Directional control was determined by the frequency
exhibiting maximal amplitude characteristics. The visual stimulation hardware
demonstrated minimal frequency deviation, with error differentials ranging from
0.15%to 0.20%across all frequencies. The implemented signal processing
algorithm successfully discriminated all four stimulus frequencies whilst
correlating them with their respective P300 event markers. Classification
accuracy was evaluated based on correct task intention recognition. The
proposed hybrid system achieved a mean classification accuracy of 86.25%,
coupled with an average ITR of 42.08 bits per minute (bpm).

this, we explored query rewriting and retrieval fusion as core strategies. We
built our pipelines around Best-of-$N$ selection and Reciprocal Rank Fusion
(RRF) strategies to handle different submission tasks. Results show that
reranking and fusion improve robustness while revealing trade-offs between
effectiveness and efficiency across both tasks.

Abstract: Traditional query expansion techniques for addressing vocabulary mismatch
problems in information retrieval are context-sensitive and may lead to
performance degradation. As an alternative, document expansion research has
gained attention, but existing methods such as Doc2Query have limitations
including excessive preprocessing costs, increased index size, and reliability
issues with generated content. To mitigate these problems and seek more
structured and efficient alternatives, this study proposes a method that
divides documents into chunk units and generates textual data for each chunk to
simultaneously improve retrieval efficiency and accuracy. The proposed "Chunk
Knowledge Generation Model" adopts a T5-based multi-task learning structure
that simultaneously generates titles and candidate questions from each document
chunk while extracting keywords from user queries. This approach maximizes
computational efficiency by generating and extracting three types of semantic
information in parallel through a single encoding and two decoding processes.
The generated data is utilized as additional information in the retrieval
system. GPT-based evaluation on 305 query-document pairs showed that retrieval
using the proposed model achieved 95.41% accuracy at Top@10, demonstrating
superior performance compared to document chunk-level retrieval. This study
contributes by proposing an approach that simultaneously generates titles and
candidate questions from document chunks for application in retrieval
pipelines, and provides empirical evidence applicable to large-scale
information retrieval systems by demonstrating improved retrieval accuracy
through qualitative evaluation.

Method: 在10个不同稀疏度和规模的公开数据集上，使用4种代表性经典架构进行大规模实验，研究嵌入维度对性能的影响

Result: 发现两种新现象：双峰现象（性能先提升后下降、再上升最终下降）和对数现象（呈现完美对数曲线），并分析了双峰现象的成因

Conclusion: 通过理论分析协同过滤模型的噪声鲁棒性，结果与实证观察相符，为嵌入维度缩放提供了新的理论解释

Abstract: Scaling recommendation models into large recommendation models has become one
of the most widely discussed topics. Recent efforts focus on components beyond
the scaling embedding dimension, as it is believed that scaling embedding may
lead to performance degradation. Although there have been some initial
observations on embedding, the root cause of their non-scalability remains
unclear. Moreover, whether performance degradation occurs across different
types of models and datasets is still an unexplored area. Regarding the effect
of embedding dimensions on performance, we conduct large-scale experiments
across 10 datasets with varying sparsity levels and scales, using 4
representative classical architectures. We surprisingly observe two novel
phenomenon: double-peak and logarithmic. For the former, as the embedding
dimension increases, performance first improves, then declines, rises again,
and eventually drops. For the latter, it exhibits a perfect logarithmic curve.
Our contributions are threefold. First, we discover two novel phenomena when
scaling collaborative filtering models. Second, we gain an understanding of the
underlying causes of the double-peak phenomenon. Lastly, we theoretically
analyze the noise robustness of collaborative filtering models, with results
matching empirical observations.

Motivation: 电商平台中重复商品列表会导致消费者困惑和运营效率低下，传统基于关键词的方法无法准确识别语义相似的重复商品。

Method: 使用基于BERT架构的领域特定文本模型和MaskedAutoEncoders图像表示，结合降维技术生成128维嵌入向量，并开发了整合文本和图像向量的决策模型，通过Milvus向量数据库实现高效相似性搜索。

Result: 系统在超过2亿商品的数据集上仅消耗100GB内存，实现了0.90的宏平均F1分数，优于第三方解决方案的0.83。

Conclusion: 研究表明将领域特定适应与先进机器学习技术结合，可以有效解决大规模电商环境中的重复商品问题。

Abstract: In large scale e-commerce marketplaces, duplicate product listings frequently
cause consumer confusion and operational inefficiencies, degrading trust on the
platform and increasing costs. Traditional keyword-based search methodologies
falter in accurately identifying duplicates due to their reliance on exact
textual matches, neglecting semantic similarities inherent in product titles.
To address these challenges, we introduce a scalable, multimodal product
deduplication designed specifically for the e-commerce domain. Our approach
employs a domain-specific text model grounded in BERT architecture in
conjunction with MaskedAutoEncoders for image representations. Both of these
architectures are augmented with dimensionality reduction techniques to produce
compact 128-dimensional embeddings without significant information loss.
Complementing this, we also developed a novel decider model that leverages both
text and image vectors. By integrating these feature extraction mechanisms with
Milvus, an optimized vector database, our system can facilitate efficient and
high-precision similarity searches across extensive product catalogs exceeding
200 million items with just 100GB of system RAM consumption. Empirical
evaluations demonstrate that our matching system achieves a macro-average F1
score of 0.90, outperforming third-party solutions which attain an F1 score of
0.83. Our findings show the potential of combining domain-specific adaptations
with state-of-the-art machine learning techniques to mitigate duplicate
listings in large-scale e-commerce environments.

Abstract: Industrial workflows demand adaptive and trustworthy assistance that can
operate under limited computing, connectivity, and strict privacy constraints.
In this work, we present MICA (Multi-Agent Industrial Coordination Assistant),
a perception-grounded and speech-interactive system that delivers real-time
guidance for assembly, troubleshooting, part queries, and maintenance. MICA
coordinates five role-specialized language agents, audited by a safety checker,
to ensure accurate and compliant support. To achieve robust step understanding,
we introduce Adaptive Step Fusion (ASF), which dynamically blends expert
reasoning with online adaptation from natural speech feedback. Furthermore, we
establish a new multi-agent coordination benchmark across representative task
categories and propose evaluation metrics tailored to industrial assistance,
enabling systematic comparison of different coordination topologies. Our
experiments demonstrate that MICA consistently improves task success,
reliability, and responsiveness over baseline structures, while remaining
deployable on practical offline hardware. Together, these contributions
highlight MICA as a step toward deployable, privacy-preserving multi-agent
assistants for dynamic factory environments. The source code will be made
publicly available at https://github.com/Kratos-Wen/MICA.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种神经算法推理器来解决背包问题，通过模仿经典算法的两阶段动态规划流程，实现了比直接预测基线更好的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经算法推理领域缺乏对背包问题这一连接经典算法和组合优化的伪多项式问题的研究，而标准NAR基准中忽略了这一问题。

Method: 设计了一个紧密遵循背包问题两阶段流程的神经算法推理器：第一阶段构建动态规划表，第二阶段从表中重建解决方案，通过动态规划监督来建模中间状态。

Result: 该方法在泛化到更大问题实例时表现优于仅从问题输入直接预测最优子集的基线方法。

Conclusion: 通过模仿经典算法的结构化流程，神经算法推理器能够更好地处理复杂的组合优化问题，特别是在泛化能力方面具有优势。

Abstract: Neural algorithmic reasoning (NAR) is a growing field that aims to embed
algorithmic logic into neural networks by imitating classical algorithms. In
this extended abstract, we detail our attempt to build a neural algorithmic
reasoner that can solve Knapsack, a pseudo-polynomial problem bridging
classical algorithms and combinatorial optimisation, but omitted in standard
NAR benchmarks. Our neural algorithmic reasoner is designed to closely follow
the two-phase pipeline for the Knapsack problem, which involves first
constructing the dynamic programming table and then reconstructing the solution
from it. The approach, which models intermediate states through dynamic
programming supervision, achieves better generalization to larger problem
instances than a direct-prediction baseline that attempts to select the optimal
subset only from the problem inputs.

TL;DR: 本文评估了MetaLight这一最先进的元强化学习方法在交通信号控制中的应用，发现虽然在某些条件下表现良好，但在其他条件下可能表现不佳（误差高达22%），表明元强化学习方案通常不够稳健，甚至可能带来重大可靠性问题。


<details>

Motivation: 随着机器学习和人工智能在智能交通网络中的应用增加，强化学习被证明是一种有前景的方法。然而，由于输入数据分布相对于训练数据分布的动态变化，训练后的强化学习代理的可靠性存在问题，这带来了重大挑战和可靠性问题。

Method: 本文评估和分析了一种名为MetaLight的最先进元强化学习方法，该方法旨在解决数据分布变化的问题。

Result: 研究发现，在某些条件下MetaLight确实能产生相当好的结果，但在其他条件下可能表现不佳，误差高达22%。

Conclusion: 元强化学习方案通常不够稳健，甚至可能带来重大可靠性问题，需要进一步改进以确保在实际交通信号控制中的可靠性。

Abstract: The use of Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) in smart
transportation networks has increased significantly in the last few years.
Among these ML and AI approaches, Reinforcement Learning (RL) has been shown to
be a very promising approach by several authors. However, a problem with using
Reinforcement Learning in Traffic Signal Control is the reliability of the
trained RL agents due to the dynamically changing distribution of the input
data with respect to the distribution of the data used for training. This
presents a major challenge and a reliability problem for the trained network of
AI agents and could have very undesirable and even detrimental consequences if
a suitable solution is not found. Several researchers have tried to address
this problem using different approaches. In particular, Meta Reinforcement
Learning (Meta RL) promises to be an effective solution. In this paper, we
evaluate and analyze a state-of-the-art Meta RL approach called MetaLight and
show that, while under certain conditions MetaLight can indeed lead to
reasonably good results, under some other conditions it might not perform well
(with errors of up to 22%), suggesting that Meta RL schemes are often not
robust enough and can even pose major reliability problems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统系统综述方法或基于优化的方法存在开销大、效率低的问题，需要一种更高效、相关性更高的自动化文献综述工具

Method: 使用transformer嵌入模型生成语义表示，通过余弦相似度计算论文相关性，采用统计阈值方法过滤相关论文，评估了三种嵌入模型

Result: 尽管缺乏启发式反馈或真实相关性标签，该系统显示出作为初步研究和探索性分析的可扩展实用工具的潜力

Conclusion: 该方法为自动化文献综述提供了一个有前景的解决方案，具有可扩展性和实用性

Abstract: We propose an automated pipeline for performing literature reviews using
semantic similarity. Unlike traditional systematic review systems or
optimization based methods, this work emphasizes minimal overhead and high
relevance by using transformer based embeddings and cosine similarity. By
providing a paper title and abstract, it generates relevant keywords, fetches
relevant papers from open access repository, and ranks them based on their
semantic closeness to the input. Three embedding models were evaluated. A
statistical thresholding approach is then applied to filter relevant papers,
enabling an effective literature review pipeline. Despite the absence of
heuristic feedback or ground truth relevance labels, the proposed system shows
promise as a scalable and practical tool for preliminary research and
exploratory analysis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs的预训练知识虽然有助于分析任务，但也带来了知识驱动幻觉的风险，即模型输出可能违背明确的来源证据。本文旨在通过业务流程管理领域来研究这一现象。

Method: 通过受控实验，设计标准流程和故意非典型流程结构的输入场景，测量LLMs对提供证据的忠实度，评估模型在证据与背景知识冲突时的表现。

Result: 研究发现LLMs确实存在知识驱动幻觉现象，当提供的证据与模型预训练知识冲突时，模型倾向于依赖内部知识而非明确证据。

Conclusion: 本文提出了评估这一关键可靠性问题的方法论，并强调在任何基于证据的领域中都需要对AI生成产物进行严格验证的重要性。

Abstract: The utility of Large Language Models (LLMs) in analytical tasks is rooted in
their vast pre-trained knowledge, which allows them to interpret ambiguous
inputs and infer missing information. However, this same capability introduces
a critical risk of what we term knowledge-driven hallucination: a phenomenon
where the model's output contradicts explicit source evidence because it is
overridden by the model's generalized internal knowledge. This paper
investigates this phenomenon by evaluating LLMs on the task of automated
process modeling, where the goal is to generate a formal business process model
from a given source artifact. The domain of Business Process Management (BPM)
provides an ideal context for this study, as many core business processes
follow standardized patterns, making it likely that LLMs possess strong
pre-trained schemas for them. We conduct a controlled experiment designed to
create scenarios with deliberate conflict between provided evidence and the
LLM's background knowledge. We use inputs describing both standard and
deliberately atypical process structures to measure the LLM's fidelity to the
provided evidence. Our work provides a methodology for assessing this critical
reliability issue and raises awareness of the need for rigorous validation of
AI-generated artifacts in any evidence-based domain.

Motivation: 传统评估方法无法充分诊断具有随机性和多步决策过程的LLM智能体性能，需要新的框架来标准化专家行为转移。

Method: 框架包含三个核心组件：专家标注的黄金数据集、通过行为变异生成的银数据集、以及基于LLM的智能体评判系统，该系统评分并提供针对性改进建议。

Result: 在多智能体招聘助手系统上的实验表明，该框架能够发现潜在的认知失败（如偏见表达、提取漂移和工具误路由），同时引导智能体达到专家级推理和风格。

Conclusion: 该研究为随机性、工具增强的LLM智能体建立了标准化、可复现的专家行为转移基础，从静态评估转向主动的专家系统优化。

Abstract: The rapid evolution of neural architectures - from multilayer perceptrons to
large-scale Transformer-based models - has enabled language models (LLMs) to
exhibit emergent agentic behaviours when equipped with memory, planning, and
external tool use. However, their inherent stochasticity and multi-step
decision processes render classical evaluation methods inadequate for
diagnosing agentic performance. This work introduces a diagnostic framework for
expert systems that not only evaluates but also facilitates the transfer of
expert behaviour into LLM-powered agents. The framework integrates (i) curated
golden datasets of expert annotations, (ii) silver datasets generated through
controlled behavioural mutation, and (iii) an LLM-based Agent Judge that scores
and prescribes targeted improvements. These prescriptions are embedded into a
vectorized recommendation map, allowing expert interventions to propagate as
reusable improvement trajectories across multiple system instances. We
demonstrate the framework on a multi-agent recruiter-assistant system, showing
that it uncovers latent cognitive failures - such as biased phrasing,
extraction drift, and tool misrouting - while simultaneously steering agents
toward expert-level reasoning and style. The results establish a foundation for
standardized, reproducible expert behaviour transfer in stochastic,
tool-augmented LLM agents, moving beyond static evaluation to active expert
system refinement.

TL;DR: CLIMB是一个自动化构建职业分类法的框架，通过全局语义聚类和多代理系统从原始招聘信息中创建高质量、数据驱动的分类法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有职业分类法构建方法存在不足：人工构建速度慢，自动化方法要么无法适应动态区域市场（自上而下），要么难以从噪声数据构建连贯层次结构（自下而上）

Method: CLIMB使用全局语义聚类提炼核心职业，然后采用基于反思的多代理系统迭代构建连贯的层次结构

Result: 在三个不同的真实数据集上，CLIMB产生的分类法比现有方法更连贯和可扩展，并成功捕捉了独特的区域特征

Conclusion: CLIMB框架能够完全自动化地从原始招聘信息中创建高质量的职业分类法，解决了现有方法的局限性

Abstract: Creating robust occupation taxonomies, vital for applications ranging from
job recommendation to labor market intelligence, is challenging. Manual
curation is slow, while existing automated methods are either not adaptive to
dynamic regional markets (top-down) or struggle to build coherent hierarchies
from noisy data (bottom-up). We introduce CLIMB (CLusterIng-based Multi-agent
taxonomy Builder), a framework that fully automates the creation of
high-quality, data-driven taxonomies from raw job postings. CLIMB uses global
semantic clustering to distill core occupations, then employs a
reflection-based multi-agent system to iteratively build a coherent hierarchy.
On three diverse, real-world datasets, we show that CLIMB produces taxonomies
that are more coherent and scalable than existing methods and successfully
capture unique regional characteristics. We release our code and datasets at

TL;DR: FragmentRetro是一种新颖的逆合成方法，通过碎片化算法实现二次复杂度，相比传统树搜索方法的指数复杂度有显著改进


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统树搜索方法在逆合成中面临指数级计算复杂度问题，需要更高效的算法来支持计算机辅助合成规划

Method: 结合BRICS和r-BRICS碎片化算法，采用库存感知探索和模式指纹筛选，递归组合分子片段并验证其在构建块集中的存在

Result: FragmentRetro实现O(h²)复杂度，在PaRoutes、USPTO-190和天然产物测试中达到高解决率，包括树搜索失败的情况

Conclusion: FragmentRetro作为可扩展自动化合成规划的强大基础组件，专注于高效识别基于片段的解决方案而非完整反应路径

Abstract: Retrosynthesis, the process of deconstructing a target molecule into simpler
precursors, is crucial for computer-aided synthesis planning (CASP). Widely
adopted tree-search methods often suffer from exponential computational
complexity. In this work, we introduce FragmentRetro, a novel retrosynthetic
method that leverages fragmentation algorithms, specifically BRICS and r-BRICS,
combined with stock-aware exploration and pattern fingerprint screening to
achieve quadratic complexity. FragmentRetro recursively combines molecular
fragments and verifies their presence in a building block set, providing sets
of fragment combinations as retrosynthetic solutions. We present the first
formal computational analysis of retrosynthetic methods, showing that tree
search exhibits exponential complexity $O(b^h)$, DirectMultiStep scales as
$O(h^6)$, and FragmentRetro achieves $O(h^2)$, where $h$ represents the number
of heavy atoms in the target molecule and $b$ is the branching factor for tree
search. Evaluations on PaRoutes, USPTO-190, and natural products demonstrate
that FragmentRetro achieves high solved rates with competitive runtime,
including cases where tree search fails. The method benefits from fingerprint
screening, which significantly reduces substructure matching complexity. While
FragmentRetro focuses on efficiently identifying fragment-based solutions
rather than full reaction pathways, its computational advantages and ability to
generate strategic starting candidates establish it as a powerful foundational
component for scalable and automated synthesis planning.

TL;DR: 该研究评估了通过MCP协议将LLM与医院EHR数据库连接，在真实医院环境中自主检索临床相关信息的能力，结果显示在简单任务中达到近乎完美的准确性，但在复杂任务中存在挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在医学领域有应用潜力，但由于无法直接访问电子健康记录系统，在医院部署受限。Model Context Protocol (MCP) 为LLM与外部工具集成提供了可能。

Method: 开发了EHR-MCP框架，将自定义MCP工具与医院EHR数据库集成，使用GPT-4.1通过LangGraph ReAct代理进行交互。测试了感染控制团队的6个任务，回顾性分析了8名患者，与医生生成的金标准进行比较。

Result: LLM能一致选择并执行正确的MCP工具，除两个任务外，所有任务都达到近乎完美的准确性。在需要时间相关计算的复杂任务中表现较差。大多数错误源于参数不正确或工具结果误解。

Conclusion: LLM可以通过MCP工具从EHR中检索临床数据，在简单任务中表现优异，但在复杂任务中面临挑战。EHR-MCP为安全、一致的数据访问提供了基础设施，是医院AI代理的基础。未来工作应扩展到推理、生成和临床影响评估。

Abstract: Background: Large language models (LLMs) show promise in medicine, but their
deployment in hospitals is limited by restricted access to electronic health
record (EHR) systems. The Model Context Protocol (MCP) enables integration
between LLMs and external tools.
  Objective: To evaluate whether an LLM connected to an EHR database via MCP
can autonomously retrieve clinically relevant information in a real hospital
setting.
  Methods: We developed EHR-MCP, a framework of custom MCP tools integrated
with the hospital EHR database, and used GPT-4.1 through a LangGraph ReAct
agent to interact with it. Six tasks were tested, derived from use cases of the
infection control team (ICT). Eight patients discussed at ICT conferences were
retrospectively analyzed. Agreement with physician-generated gold standards was
measured.
  Results: The LLM consistently selected and executed the correct MCP tools.
Except for two tasks, all tasks achieved near-perfect accuracy. Performance was
lower in the complex task requiring time-dependent calculations. Most errors
arose from incorrect arguments or misinterpretation of tool results. Responses
from EHR-MCP were reliable, though long and repetitive data risked exceeding
the context window.
  Conclusions: LLMs can retrieve clinical data from an EHR via MCP tools in a
real hospital setting, achieving near-perfect performance in simple tasks while
highlighting challenges in complex ones. EHR-MCP provides an infrastructure for
secure, consistent data access and may serve as a foundation for hospital AI
agents. Future work should extend beyond retrieval to reasoning, generation,
and clinical impact assessment, paving the way for effective integration of
generative AI into clinical practice.

TL;DR: 本文提出了评估和减轻AI系统"阴谋"（秘密追求未对齐目标）的方法，通过设计隐蔽行动评估来测试反阴谋干预措施的有效性，并以审议对齐作为案例研究进行验证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高度能力的AI系统可能秘密追求未对齐的目标（即"阴谋"），由于阴谋AI会故意隐藏其未对齐的目标和行为，需要不同于传统ML的策略来测量和减轻阴谋。

Method: 使用隐蔽行动作为阴谋的代理指标，设计评估方法，包括测试在分布外任务上的阴谋倾向、评估是否由情境意识驱动、检查对预先存在的未对齐目标的鲁棒性。以审议对齐作为案例进行压力测试。

Result: 在26个分布外评估中，审议对齐将隐蔽行动率从13%降低到0.4%，但未完全消除。能够大部分阻止模型追求预先训练的隐藏目标，但在额外红队测试后仍发现不当行为。模型的思想链显示了对对齐评估的情境意识。

Conclusion: 观察到的隐蔽行动率降低可能至少部分由情境意识驱动。随着模型推理逐渐偏离标准英语，依赖人类可读思想链的能力会下降。需要进一步研究针对阴谋的对齐缓解措施及其评估，特别是欺骗性对齐的对抗性情况。

Abstract: Highly capable AI systems could secretly pursue misaligned goals -- what we
call "scheming". Because a scheming AI would deliberately try to hide its
misaligned goals and actions, measuring and mitigating scheming requires
different strategies than are typically used in ML. We propose that assessing
anti-scheming interventions requires at least (1) testing propensity to scheme
on far out-of-distribution (OOD) tasks, (2) evaluating whether lack of scheming
is driven by situational awareness, and (3) checking for robustness to
pre-existing misaligned goals. We use a broad category of "covert actions" --
such as secretly breaking rules or intentionally underperforming in tests -- as
a proxy for scheming, and design evaluations for covert actions. We then
stress-test deliberative alignment as a case study for anti-scheming. Across 26
OOD evaluations (180+ environments), deliberative alignment reduces covert
action rates (OpenAI o3: 13%->0.4%) but does not fully eliminate them. Our
mitigation is also able to largely stop agents from pursuing a hidden goal
previously trained into the model, but we still find misbehavior after
additional red-teaming. We find that models' chain-of-thought (CoT) often
demonstrates awareness of being evaluated for alignment, and show causal
evidence that this awareness decreases covert behavior, while unawareness
increases it. Therefore, we cannot exclude that the observed reductions in
covert action rates are at least partially driven by situational awareness.
While we rely on human-legible CoT for training, studying situational
awareness, and demonstrating clear evidence of misalignment, our ability to
rely on this degrades as models continue to depart from reasoning in standard
English. We encourage research into alignment mitigations for scheming and
their assessment, especially for the adversarial case of deceptive alignment,
which this paper does not address.

Abstract: This paper presents MicroRCA-Agent, an innovative solution for microservice
root cause analysis based on large language model agents, which constructs an
intelligent fault root cause localization system with multimodal data fusion.
The technical innovations are embodied in three key aspects: First, we combine
the pre-trained Drain log parsing algorithm with multi-level data filtering
mechanism to efficiently compress massive logs into high-quality fault
features. Second, we employ a dual anomaly detection approach that integrates
Isolation Forest unsupervised learning algorithms with status code validation
to achieve comprehensive trace anomaly identification. Third, we design a
statistical symmetry ratio filtering mechanism coupled with a two-stage LLM
analysis strategy to enable full-stack phenomenon summarization across
node-service-pod hierarchies. The multimodal root cause analysis module
leverages carefully designed cross-modal prompts to deeply integrate multimodal
anomaly information, fully exploiting the cross-modal understanding and logical
reasoning capabilities of large language models to generate structured analysis
results encompassing fault components, root cause descriptions, and reasoning
trace. Comprehensive ablation studies validate the complementary value of each
modal data and the effectiveness of the system architecture. The proposed
solution demonstrates superior performance in complex microservice fault
scenarios, achieving a final score of 50.71. The code has been released at:

Abstract: The automated repair of C++ compilation errors presents a significant
challenge, the resolution of which is critical for developer productivity.
Progress in this domain is constrained by two primary factors: the scarcity of
large-scale, high-fidelity datasets and the limitations of conventional
supervised methods, which often fail to generate semantically correct
patches.This paper addresses these gaps by introducing a comprehensive
framework with three core contributions. First, we present CCrepair, a novel,
large-scale C++ compilation error dataset constructed through a sophisticated
generate-and-verify pipeline. Second, we propose a Reinforcement Learning (RL)
paradigm guided by a hybrid reward signal, shifting the focus from mere
compilability to the semantic quality of the fix. Finally, we establish the
robust, two-stage evaluation system providing this signal, centered on an
LLM-as-a-Judge whose reliability has been rigorously validated against the
collective judgments of a panel of human experts. This integrated approach
aligns the training objective with generating high-quality, non-trivial patches
that are both syntactically and semantically correct. The effectiveness of our
approach was demonstrated experimentally. Our RL-trained Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct
model achieved performance comparable to a Qwen2.5-14B-Instruct model,
validating the efficiency of our training paradigm. Our work provides the
research community with a valuable new dataset and a more effective paradigm
for training and evaluating robust compilation repair models, paving the way
for more practical and reliable automated programming assistants.

Abstract: Robotic process automation (RPA) is a lightweight approach to automating
business processes using software robots that emulate user actions at the
graphical user interface level. While RPA has gained popularity for its
cost-effective and timely automation of rule-based, well-structured tasks, its
symbolic nature has inherent limitations when approaching more complex tasks
currently performed by human agents. Machine learning concepts enabling
intelligent RPA provide an opportunity to broaden the range of automatable
tasks. In this paper, we conduct a literature review to explore the connections
between RPA and machine learning and organize the joint concept intelligent RPA
into a taxonomy. Our taxonomy comprises the two meta-characteristics RPA-ML
integration and RPA-ML interaction. Together, they comprise eight dimensions:
architecture and ecosystem, capabilities, data basis, intelligence level, and
technical depth of integration as well as deployment environment, lifecycle
phase, and user-robot relation.

*Giovanni De Gasperis,Sante Dino Facchini*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文比较了工业监控系统中基于规则的方法和数据驱动方法的优缺点，并提出了一个评估框架和混合解决方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业4.0环境下，监控系统正从传统基于规则架构转向数据驱动方法，需要系统比较这两种方法以指导实际应用。

Method: 通过分析两种方法各自的优势、局限性和应用场景，提出基本评估框架，并探讨混合解决方案的可能性。

Result: 基于规则系统在可解释性、确定性行为和稳定环境中表现优异，但缺乏可扩展性和适应性；数据驱动系统在异常检测和预测性维护方面表现突出，但面临数据可用性和可解释性挑战。

Conclusion: 未来工业监控系统的发展方向是智能协同系统，结合专家知识和数据驱动洞察，以增强韧性、运营效率和信任度。

Abstract: Industrial monitoring systems, especially when deployed in Industry 4.0
environments, are experiencing a shift in paradigm from traditional rule-based
architectures to data-driven approaches leveraging machine learning and
artificial intelligence. This study presents a comparison between these two
methodologies, analyzing their respective strengths, limitations, and
application scenarios, and proposes a basic framework to evaluate their key
properties. Rule-based systems offer high interpretability, deterministic
behavior, and ease of implementation in stable environments, making them ideal
for regulated industries and safety-critical applications. However, they face
challenges with scalability, adaptability, and performance in complex or
evolving contexts. Conversely, data-driven systems excel in detecting hidden
anomalies, enabling predictive maintenance and dynamic adaptation to new
conditions. Despite their high accuracy, these models face challenges related
to data availability, explainability, and integration complexity. The paper
suggests hybrid solutions as a possible promising direction, combining the
transparency of rule-based logic with the analytical power of machine learning.
Our hypothesis is that the future of industrial monitoring lies in intelligent,
synergic systems that leverage both expert knowledge and data-driven insights.
This dual approach enhances resilience, operational efficiency, and trust,
paving the way for smarter and more flexible industrial environments.

*Sander Schildermans,Chang Tian,Ying Jiao,Marie-Francine Moens*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种轻量级方法，通过使用微调的语言模型将自然语言提示自动转换为基于元组的结构化信息，以增强文本到图像生成中的空间关系准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前文本到图像生成系统在准确捕捉自然语言提示中的空间关系方面存在主要挑战，需要解决这一关键限制。

Method: 采用轻量级方法，通过微调的语言模型自动将提示转换为基于元组的结构化信息，并将其无缝集成到T2I流水线中。

Result: 实验结果显示空间准确性显著提高，同时Inception Score测量的整体图像质量未受影响，自动生成的元组质量与人工制作的元组相当。

Conclusion: 这种结构化信息为增强T2I生成中的空间关系提供了实用且可移植的解决方案，解决了当前大规模生成系统的关键限制。

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) generation has advanced rapidly, yet faithfully capturing
spatial relationships described in natural language prompts remains a major
challenge. Prior efforts have addressed this issue through prompt optimization,
spatially grounded generation, and semantic refinement. This work introduces a
lightweight approach that augments prompts with tuple-based structured
information, using a fine-tuned language model for automatic conversion and
seamless integration into T2I pipelines. Experimental results demonstrate
substantial improvements in spatial accuracy, without compromising overall
image quality as measured by Inception Score. Furthermore, the automatically
generated tuples exhibit quality comparable to human-crafted tuples. This
structured information provides a practical and portable solution to enhance
spatial relationships in T2I generation, addressing a key limitation of current
large-scale generative systems.

### [135] [Attention Schema-based Attention Control (ASAC): A Cognitive-Inspired Approach for Attention Management in Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16058)
*Krati Saxena,Federico Jurado Ruiz,Guido Manzi,Dianbo Liu,Alex Lamb*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出ASAC（基于注意力模式的注意力控制）方法，将认知科学中的注意力模式理论引入人工神经网络，通过在Transformer架构中嵌入VQVAE模块来实现精确的注意力管理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受认知科学中注意力模式理论（AST）的启发，该理论认为人类通过创建注意力本身的模型来管理注意力分配。作者希望将这一认知机制引入AI系统，以提升注意力机制的效率和性能。

Method: 在Transformer架构中嵌入ASAC模块，该模块使用向量量化变分自编码器（VQVAE）作为注意力抽象器和控制器，通过显式建模注意力分配来实现精确的注意力管理。

Result: 在视觉和NLP领域的实验中，ASAC不仅提高了分类准确率，还加速了学习过程。模型在噪声数据和分布外数据上表现出良好的鲁棒性和泛化能力，在多任务设置中也有改进表现。此外，该方法还增强了对抗攻击的抵抗力，优化了注意力分配效率。

Conclusion: 该研究建立了认知科学与机器学习之间的联系，为AI系统中注意力机制的高效利用提供了新思路，展示了基于注意力模式的方法在提升模型性能和效率方面的潜力。

Abstract: Attention mechanisms have become integral in AI, significantly enhancing
model performance and scalability by drawing inspiration from human cognition.
Concurrently, the Attention Schema Theory (AST) in cognitive science posits
that individuals manage their attention by creating a model of the attention
itself, effectively allocating cognitive resources. Inspired by AST, we
introduce ASAC (Attention Schema-based Attention Control), which integrates the
attention schema concept into artificial neural networks. Our initial
experiments focused on embedding the ASAC module within transformer
architectures. This module employs a Vector-Quantized Variational AutoEncoder
(VQVAE) as both an attention abstractor and controller, facilitating precise
attention management. By explicitly modeling attention allocation, our approach
aims to enhance system efficiency. We demonstrate ASAC's effectiveness in both
the vision and NLP domains, highlighting its ability to improve classification
accuracy and expedite the learning process. Our experiments with vision
transformers across various datasets illustrate that the attention controller
not only boosts classification accuracy but also accelerates learning.
Furthermore, we have demonstrated the model's robustness and generalization
capabilities across noisy and out-of-distribution datasets. In addition, we
have showcased improved performance in multi-task settings. Quick experiments
reveal that the attention schema-based module enhances resilience to
adversarial attacks, optimizes attention to improve learning efficiency, and
facilitates effective transfer learning and learning from fewer examples. These
promising results establish a connection between cognitive science and machine
learning, shedding light on the efficient utilization of attention mechanisms
in AI systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一种自动分析和追踪在线言论的方法，用于检测作者是否可能涉及极端主义或恐怖主义。系统包括在线收集言论、机器学习分类、追踪器和可视化分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 需要自动检测在线极端主义和恐怖主义言论，以帮助安全分析和预防工作。

Method: 使用Universal Sentence Encoder提取512维特征向量，训练支持向量机分类器，采用10折交叉验证，并应用追踪算法进行时间分析。

Result: 系统在839条引文数据集上，极端主义检测准确率81%，恐怖主义检测准确率97%，优于基于n-gram的基线系统。追踪算法能检测态度趋势和突变。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效检测和追踪极端主义及恐怖主义言论，为在线安全监控提供实用工具。

Abstract: This paper proposes an approach for automatically analysing and tracking
statements in material gathered online and detecting whether the authors of the
statements are likely to be involved in extremism or terrorism. The proposed
system comprises: online collation of statements that are then encoded in a
form amenable to machine learning (ML), an ML component to classify the encoded
text, a tracker, and a visualisation system for analysis of results. The
detection and tracking concept has been tested using quotes made by terrorists,
extremists, campaigners, and politicians, obtained from wikiquote.org. A set of
features was extracted for each quote using the state-of-the-art Universal
Sentence Encoder (Cer et al. 2018), which produces 512-dimensional vectors. The
data were used to train and test a support vector machine (SVM) classifier
using 10-fold cross-validation. The system was able to correctly detect
intentions and attitudes associated with extremism 81% of the time and
terrorism 97% of the time, using a dataset of 839 quotes. This accuracy was
higher than that which was achieved for a simple baseline system based on
n-gram text features. Tracking techniques were also used to perform a temporal
analysis of the data, with each quote considered to be a noisy measurement of a
person's state of mind. It was demonstrated that the tracking algorithms were
able to detect both trends over time and sharp changes in attitude that could
be attributed to major events.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于提示的学习框架，将知识获取和移除统一在单一训练阶段中，通过将类别级语义绑定到专用提示令牌来实现即时遗忘，无需重新训练或修改模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基础模型的静态部署与日益增长的社会和监管需求（如GDPR要求的数据遗忘）存在冲突。传统遗忘方法计算成本高、脆弱且不适合实时系统。

Method: 采用提示学习框架，将信息编码在提示令牌而非模型权重中，通过移除对应提示令牌实现即时遗忘，无需重新训练或访问原始数据。

Result: 实验表明该框架在保留类别上保持预测性能，同时有效擦除遗忘类别，具有强大的隐私和安全保证，能够抵抗成员推理攻击。

Conclusion: 通过在架构中嵌入可移除性，这项工作为设计模块化、可扩展和符合伦理的AI模型建立了新的基础。

Abstract: Foundation models have transformed multimedia analysis by enabling robust and
transferable representations across diverse modalities and tasks. However,
their static deployment conflicts with growing societal and regulatory demands
-- particularly the need to unlearn specific data upon request, as mandated by
privacy frameworks such as the GDPR. Traditional unlearning approaches,
including retraining, activation editing, or distillation, are often
computationally expensive, fragile, and ill-suited for real-time or
continuously evolving systems. In this paper, we propose a paradigm shift:
rethinking unlearning not as a retroactive intervention but as a built-in
capability. We introduce a prompt-based learning framework that unifies
knowledge acquisition and removal within a single training phase. Rather than
encoding information in model weights, our approach binds class-level semantics
to dedicated prompt tokens. This design enables instant unlearning simply by
removing the corresponding prompt -- without retraining, model modification, or
access to original data. Experiments demonstrate that our framework preserves
predictive performance on retained classes while effectively erasing forgotten
ones. Beyond utility, our method exhibits strong privacy and security
guarantees: it is resistant to membership inference attacks, and prompt removal
prevents any residual knowledge extraction, even under adversarial conditions.
This ensures compliance with data protection principles and safeguards against
unauthorized access to forgotten information, making the framework suitable for
deployment in sensitive and regulated environments. Overall, by embedding
removability into the architecture itself, this work establishes a new
foundation for designing modular, scalable and ethically responsive AI models.

TL;DR: MPNP-DDI是一个基于多尺度图神经过程的药物相互作用预测框架，通过层次化图表示学习和跨药物注意力机制，实现了准确且具有不确定性估计的DDI预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有DDI预测方法难以捕捉不同尺度的结构信息（从局部官能团到全局分子拓扑），且缺乏预测置信度量化机制。

Method: 提出多尺度图神经过程框架，包含迭代消息传递学习层次化图表示、跨药物协同注意力机制动态融合多尺度表示，以及集成神经过程模块进行不确定性估计。

Result: 在基准数据集上的广泛实验表明，MPNP-DDI显著优于现有最先进基线方法。

Conclusion: MPNP-DDI通过基于多尺度结构特征的准确、可泛化且具有不确定性感知的预测，为药物警戒、多重用药风险评估和精准医疗提供了强大的计算工具。

Abstract: Accurate prediction of drug-drug interactions (DDI) is crucial for medication
safety and effective drug development. However, existing methods often struggle
to capture structural information across different scales, from local
functional groups to global molecular topology, and typically lack mechanisms
to quantify prediction confidence. To address these limitations, we propose
MPNP-DDI, a novel Multi-scale Graph Neural Process framework. The core of
MPNP-DDI is a unique message-passing scheme that, by being iteratively applied,
learns a hierarchy of graph representations at multiple scales. Crucially, a
cross-drug co-attention mechanism then dynamically fuses these multi-scale
representations to generate context-aware embeddings for interacting drug
pairs, while an integrated neural process module provides principled
uncertainty estimation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MPNP-DDI
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on benchmark datasets. By
providing accurate, generalizable, and uncertainty-aware predictions built upon
multi-scale structural features, MPNP-DDI represents a powerful computational
tool for pharmacovigilance, polypharmacy risk assessment, and precision
medicine.

Abstract: Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) has made significant advancements
in fields such as computer vision (CV) and natural language processing (NLP),
demonstrating its capability to synthesize high-fidelity data and improve
generalization. Recently, there has been growing interest in integrating GenAI
into wireless sensing systems. By leveraging generative techniques such as data
augmentation, domain adaptation, and denoising, wireless sensing applications,
including device localization, human activity recognition, and environmental
monitoring, can be significantly improved. This survey investigates the
convergence of GenAI and wireless sensing from two complementary perspectives.
First, we explore how GenAI can be integrated into wireless sensing pipelines,
focusing on two modes of integration: as a plugin to augment task-specific
models and as a solver to directly address sensing tasks. Second, we analyze
the characteristics of mainstream generative models, such as Generative
Adversarial Networks (GANs), Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), and diffusion
models, and discuss their applicability and unique advantages across various
wireless sensing tasks. We further identify key challenges in applying GenAI to
wireless sensing and outline a future direction toward a wireless foundation
model: a unified, pre-trained design capable of scalable, adaptable, and
efficient signal understanding across diverse sensing tasks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出IEFS-GMB方法，基于信息熵和梯度记忆库进行EEG特征选择，提升神经疾病分类准确率和可解释性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有EEG特征选择方法缺乏针对性、架构依赖性强、可解释性差，且对信号变异性鲁棒性不足

Method: 构建动态梯度记忆库存储历史梯度，通过信息熵计算特征重要性，应用熵加权选择信息丰富的EEG特征

Result: 在四个公共神经疾病数据集上，IEFS-GMB增强的编码器比基线模型准确率提升0.64%-6.45%，优于四种竞争方法

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升EEG分类性能，增强模型可解释性，支持临床实际应用

Abstract: Deep learning-based EEG classification is crucial for the automated detection
of neurological disorders, improving diagnostic accuracy and enabling early
intervention. However, the low signal-to-noise ratio of EEG signals limits
model performance, making feature selection (FS) vital for optimizing
representations learned by neural network encoders. Existing FS methods are
seldom designed specifically for EEG diagnosis; many are architecture-dependent
and lack interpretability, limiting their applicability. Moreover, most rely on
single-iteration data, resulting in limited robustness to variability. To
address these issues, we propose IEFS-GMB, an Information Entropy-based Feature
Selection method guided by a Gradient Memory Bank. This approach constructs a
dynamic memory bank storing historical gradients, computes feature importance
via information entropy, and applies entropy-based weighting to select
informative EEG features. Experiments on four public neurological disease
datasets show that encoders enhanced with IEFS-GMB achieve accuracy
improvements of 0.64% to 6.45% over baseline models. The method also
outperforms four competing FS techniques and improves model interpretability,
supporting its practical use in clinical settings.

TL;DR: 该研究利用Twitter数据分析了三种新兴精神活性物质（摇头丸、GHB和2C-B）的用户报告效果，通过机器学习方法实现了高精度的极性分类，支持实时药物警戒。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统监测系统往往无法充分反映药物使用者的真实体验，社交媒体提供了丰富且未经过滤的用户报告数据源。

Method: 结合俚语术语和生物医学概念提取，识别并弱标注了92,000多条推文，使用成本敏感学习和合成过采样等技术训练机器学习分类器。

Result: 极端梯度提升结合成本敏感学习在测试集上表现最佳（F1=0.885，AUPRC=0.934），能够准确检测物质特异性表型效应。

Conclusion: Twitter数据可用于检测药物特异性效应，极性分类模型能够以高精度支持实时药物警戒和药物效果表征。

Abstract: Understanding the real-world effects of recreational drug use remains a
critical challenge in public health and biomedical research, especially as
traditional surveillance systems often underrepresent user experiences. In this
study, we leverage social media (specifically Twitter) as a rich and unfiltered
source of user-reported effects associated with three emerging psychoactive
substances: ecstasy, GHB, and 2C-B. By combining a curated list of slang terms
with biomedical concept extraction via MetaMap, we identified and weakly
annotated over 92,000 tweets mentioning these substances. Each tweet was
labeled with a polarity reflecting whether it reported a positive or negative
effect, following an expert-guided heuristic process. We then performed
descriptive and comparative analyses of the reported phenotypic outcomes across
substances and trained multiple machine learning classifiers to predict
polarity from tweet content, accounting for strong class imbalance using
techniques such as cost-sensitive learning and synthetic oversampling. The top
performance on the test set was obtained from eXtreme Gradient Boosting with
cost-sensitive learning (F1 = 0.885, AUPRC = 0.934). Our findings reveal that
Twitter enables the detection of substance-specific phenotypic effects, and
that polarity classification models can support real-time pharmacovigilance and
drug effect characterization with high accuracy.

Motivation: 理解大语言模型在训练过程中如何获得复杂能力是机制可解释性的关键开放问题，本研究旨在通过复杂网络理论视角来表征这些学习动态。

Method: 将基于Transformer的LLM表示为有向加权图（节点为注意力头和MLP，边通过干预消融技术测量因果影响），在Pythia-14M模型的143个训练检查点上分析图论指标。

Conclusion: 组件级网络视角为可视化和理解LLM中功能电路形成的自组织原则提供了强大的宏观视角。

Abstract: The process by which Large Language Models (LLMs) acquire complex
capabilities during training remains a key open question in mechanistic
interpretability. This project investigates whether these learning dynamics can
be characterized through the lens of Complex Network Theory (CNT). I introduce
a novel methodology to represent a Transformer-based LLM as a directed,
weighted graph where nodes are the model's computational components (attention
heads and MLPs) and edges represent causal influence, measured via an
intervention-based ablation technique. By tracking the evolution of this
component-graph across 143 training checkpoints of the Pythia-14M model on a
canonical induction task, I analyze a suite of graph-theoretic metrics. The
results reveal that the network's structure evolves through distinct phases of
exploration, consolidation, and refinement. Specifically, I identify the
emergence of a stable hierarchy of information spreader components and a
dynamic set of information gatherer components, whose roles reconfigure at key
learning junctures. This work demonstrates that a component-level network
perspective offers a powerful macroscopic lens for visualizing and
understanding the self-organizing principles that drive the formation of
functional circuits in LLMs.

column generation have been proposed in the literature. In this paper, we
propose a novel partial column generation strategy for settings with multiple
pricing problems, based on predicting which ones are likely to yield columns
with a negative reduced cost. We develop a machine learning model tailored to

strategy enhances the solution method and outperforms traditional partial
column generation approaches from the literature, particularly on hard
instances solved under a tight time limit.

Abstract: While large language models show promise in medical applications, achieving
expert-level clinical reasoning remains challenging due to the need for both
accurate answers and transparent reasoning processes. To address this
challenge, we introduce Fleming-R1, a model designed for verifiable medical
reasoning through three complementary innovations. First, our
Reasoning-Oriented Data Strategy (RODS) combines curated medical QA datasets
with knowledge-graph-guided synthesis to improve coverage of underrepresented
diseases, drugs, and multi-hop reasoning chains. Second, we employ
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) cold start to distill high-quality reasoning
trajectories from teacher models, establishing robust inference priors. Third,
we implement a two-stage Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR)
framework using Group Relative Policy Optimization, which consolidates core
reasoning skills while targeting persistent failure modes through adaptive
hard-sample mining. Across diverse medical benchmarks, Fleming-R1 delivers
substantial parameter-efficient improvements: the 7B variant surpasses much
larger baselines, while the 32B model achieves near-parity with GPT-4o and
consistently outperforms strong open-source alternatives. These results
demonstrate that structured data design, reasoning-oriented initialization, and
verifiable reinforcement learning can advance clinical reasoning beyond simple
accuracy optimization. We release Fleming-R1 publicly to promote transparent,
reproducible, and auditable progress in medical AI, enabling safer deployment
in high-stakes clinical environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准各向同性欧几里得扩散难以有效建模具有相干角度方向模式的图像（如指纹和纹理），受生物系统中相位同步现象的启发

Method: 利用随机Kuramoto动力学构建基于周期性域的分数生成模型，前向过程通过全局或局部耦合振荡器相互作用实现相位同步，反向过程通过学习的分数函数进行去同步生成

Result: 在通用图像基准上取得有竞争力的结果，在指纹和纹理等方向密集数据集上显著提升生成质量

Conclusion: 这项工作展示了生物启发的同步动力学作为生成模型中结构化先验的潜力

Abstract: Orientation-rich images, such as fingerprints and textures, often exhibit
coherent angular directional patterns that are challenging to model using
standard generative approaches based on isotropic Euclidean diffusion.
Motivated by the role of phase synchronization in biological systems, we
propose a score-based generative model built on periodic domains by leveraging
stochastic Kuramoto dynamics in the diffusion process. In neural and physical
systems, Kuramoto models capture synchronization phenomena across coupled
oscillators -- a behavior that we re-purpose here as an inductive bias for
structured image generation. In our framework, the forward process performs
\textit{synchronization} among phase variables through globally or locally
coupled oscillator interactions and attraction to a global reference phase,
gradually collapsing the data into a low-entropy von Mises distribution. The
reverse process then performs \textit{desynchronization}, generating diverse
patterns by reversing the dynamics with a learned score function. This approach
enables structured destruction during forward diffusion and a hierarchical
generation process that progressively refines global coherence into fine-scale
details. We implement wrapped Gaussian transition kernels and periodicity-aware
networks to account for the circular geometry. Our method achieves competitive
results on general image benchmarks and significantly improves generation
quality on orientation-dense datasets like fingerprints and textures.
Ultimately, this work demonstrates the promise of biologically inspired

*Jia Tang,Xinrui Wang,Songcan Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为GPLASC的对比学习策略，通过全局预固定和局部调整来解决持续学习中的任务间和任务内特征混淆问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的对比学习在持续学习中仍面临任务间和任务内特征混淆的限制，导致性能受限。

Method: 使用等角紧框架将表示空间划分为非重叠区域，为每个任务分配特定区域，同时在任务内部形成可调整的特征结构。

Result: 广泛的实验验证了该方法的有效性。

Conclusion: GPLASC方法能够同时确保任务间和任务内的判别性特征结构，并可无缝集成到现有的对比持续学习框架中。

Abstract: Continual learning (CL) involves acquiring and accumulating knowledge from
evolving tasks while alleviating catastrophic forgetting. Recently, leveraging
contrastive loss to construct more transferable and less forgetful
representations has been a promising direction in CL. Despite advancements,
their performance is still limited due to confusion arising from both
inter-task and intra-task features. To address the problem, we propose a simple
yet effective contrastive strategy named \textbf{G}lobal \textbf{P}re-fixing,
\textbf{L}ocal \textbf{A}djusting for \textbf{S}upervised \textbf{C}ontrastive
learning (GPLASC). Specifically, to avoid task-level confusion, we divide the
entire unit hypersphere of representations into non-overlapping regions, with
the centers of the regions forming an inter-task pre-fixed \textbf{E}quiangular
\textbf{T}ight \textbf{F}rame (ETF). Meanwhile, for individual tasks, our
method helps regulate the feature structure and form intra-task adjustable ETFs
within their respective allocated regions. As a result, our method
\textit{simultaneously} ensures discriminative feature structures both between
tasks and within tasks and can be seamlessly integrated into any existing
contrastive continual learning framework. Extensive experiments validate its
effectiveness.

*Petrus H. Zwart*

TL;DR: 本文提出了小样本Beta校正（SSBC）方法，用于改进分体式共形预测的覆盖方差问题，通过精确的有限样本分布提供概率保证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 分体式共形预测虽然提供边际覆盖保证，但这种保证仅在期望意义上成立。单个校准集的实现覆盖可能存在显著方差，这在实际应用中削弱了有效的风险控制。

Method: 引入小样本Beta校正（SSBC），这是一种即插即用的调整方法，利用共形覆盖的精确有限样本分布来调整共形显著性水平。

Result: SSBC方法能够提供概率保证，确保在校准抽取的用户定义概率下，部署的预测器至少达到期望的覆盖水平。

Conclusion: SSBC方法解决了分体式共形预测的覆盖方差问题，为实际应用提供了更可靠的风险控制保障。

Abstract: Conformal prediction provides distribution-free prediction sets with
guaranteed marginal coverage. However, in split conformal prediction this
guarantee is training-conditional only in expectation: across many calibration
draws, the average coverage equals the nominal level, but the realized coverage
for a single calibration set may vary substantially. This variance undermines
effective risk control in practical applications. Here we introduce the Small
Sample Beta Correction (SSBC), a plug-and-play adjustment to the conformal
significance level that leverages the exact finite-sample distribution of
conformal coverage to provide probabilistic guarantees, ensuring that with
user-defined probability over the calibration draw, the deployed predictor
achieves at least the desired coverage.

Abstract: Recent work has investigated the capabilities of large language models (LLMs)
as zero-shot models for generating individual-level characteristics (e.g., to
serve as risk models or augment survey datasets). However, when should a user
have confidence that an LLM will provide high-quality predictions for their
particular task? To address this question, we conduct a large-scale empirical
study of LLMs' zero-shot predictive capabilities across a wide range of tabular
prediction tasks. We find that LLMs' performance is highly variable, both on
tasks within the same dataset and across different datasets. However, when the
LLM performs well on the base prediction task, its predicted probabilities
become a stronger signal for individual-level accuracy. Then, we construct
metrics to predict LLMs' performance at the task level, aiming to distinguish
between tasks where LLMs may perform well and where they are likely unsuitable.
We find that some of these metrics, each of which are assessed without labeled
data, yield strong signals of LLMs' predictive performance on new tasks.

Abstract: Unfolding networks are interpretable networks emerging from iterative
algorithms, incorporate prior knowledge of data structure, and are designed to
solve inverse problems like compressed sensing, which deals with recovering
data from noisy, missing observations. Compressed sensing finds applications in
critical domains, from medical imaging to cryptography, where adversarial
robustness is crucial to prevent catastrophic failures. However, a solid
theoretical understanding of the performance of unfolding networks in the
presence of adversarial attacks is still in its infancy. In this paper, we
study the adversarial generalization of unfolding networks when perturbed with
$l_2$-norm constrained attacks, generated by the fast gradient sign method.
Particularly, we choose a family of state-of-the-art overaparameterized
unfolding networks and deploy a new framework to estimate their adversarial
Rademacher complexity. Given this estimate, we provide adversarial
generalization error bounds for the networks under study, which are tight with
respect to the attack level. To our knowledge, this is the first theoretical
analysis on the adversarial generalization of unfolding networks. We further
present a series of experiments on real-world data, with results corroborating
our derived theory, consistently for all data. Finally, we observe that the
family's overparameterization can be exploited to promote adversarial
robustness, shedding light on how to efficiently robustify neural networks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法存在独立性假设限制、样本效率低和缺乏有限时间收敛保证等问题，需要开发更有效的Stackelberg MFG求解算法。

Method: 提出AC-SMFG单循环actor-critic算法，交替更新领导者策略、代表性跟随者策略和均值场，使用连续生成的马尔可夫样本进行训练。

Result: 算法在多个经济学环境中优于现有多智能体和MFG学习方法，在策略质量和收敛速度方面表现更优。

Conclusion: AC-SMFG是首个具有非渐进收敛保证的Stackelberg MFG算法，通过梯度对齐条件放宽了现有的领导者-跟随者独立性假设。

Abstract: We study policy optimization in Stackelberg mean field games (MFGs), a
hierarchical framework for modeling the strategic interaction between a single
leader and an infinitely large population of homogeneous followers. The
objective can be formulated as a structured bi-level optimization problem, in
which the leader needs to learn a policy maximizing its reward, anticipating
the response of the followers. Existing methods for solving these (and related)
problems often rely on restrictive independence assumptions between the
leader's and followers' objectives, use samples inefficiently due to
nested-loop algorithm structure, and lack finite-time convergence guarantees.
To address these limitations, we propose AC-SMFG, a single-loop actor-critic
algorithm that operates on continuously generated Markovian samples. The
algorithm alternates between (semi-)gradient updates for the leader, a
representative follower, and the mean field, and is simple to implement in
practice. We establish the finite-time and finite-sample convergence of the
algorithm to a stationary point of the Stackelberg objective. To our knowledge,
this is the first Stackelberg MFG algorithm with non-asymptotic convergence
guarantees. Our key assumption is a "gradient alignment" condition, which
requires that the full policy gradient of the leader can be approximated by a
partial component of it, relaxing the existing leader-follower independence
assumption. Simulation results in a range of well-established economics
environments demonstrate that AC-SMFG outperforms existing multi-agent and MFG
learning baselines in policy quality and convergence speed.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: VMDNet是一个因果保持的时间序列预测框架，通过样本级VMD分解避免信息泄露，使用频率感知嵌入和并行TCN处理各模式，并采用双层优化自适应选择VMD超参数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有时间序列预测方法在捕捉周期性模式时存在信息泄露问题，且依赖不恰当的超参数调优，影响了分解技术的效果。

Method: 提出VMDNet框架：1）样本级VMD避免泄露；2）频率感知嵌入和并行TCN处理分解模式；3）双层Stackelberg优化自适应选择VMD超参数K和alpha。

Result: 在两个能源数据集上的实验表明，VMDNet在强周期性条件下达到最优性能，能有效捕捉结构化周期性模式，在弱周期性下也保持稳健。

Conclusion: VMDNet通过因果保持设计和自适应超参数选择，显著提升了周期性时间序列预测的性能，特别是在强周期性场景下表现突出。

Abstract: In time series forecasting, capturing recurrent temporal patterns is
essential; decomposition techniques make such structure explicit and thereby
improve predictive performance. Variational Mode Decomposition (VMD) is a
powerful signal-processing method for periodicity-aware decomposition and has
seen growing adoption in recent years. However, existing studies often suffer
from information leakage and rely on inappropriate hyperparameter tuning. To
address these issues, we propose VMDNet, a causality-preserving framework that
(i) applies sample-wise VMD to avoid leakage; (ii) represents each decomposed
mode with frequency-aware embeddings and decodes it using parallel temporal
convolutional networks (TCNs), ensuring mode independence and efficient
learning; and (iii) introduces a bilevel, Stackelberg-inspired optimisation to
adaptively select VMD's two core hyperparameters: the number of modes (K) and
the bandwidth penalty (alpha). Experiments on two energy-related datasets
demonstrate that VMDNet achieves state-of-the-art results when periodicity is
strong, showing clear advantages in capturing structured periodic patterns
while remaining robust under weak periodicity.

Conclusion: 这是首个为随机分层优化提供自适应且尖锐收敛保证的工作，在合成和深度学习任务上的实验验证了算法的有效性。

Abstract: Hierarchical optimization refers to problems with interdependent decision
variables and objectives, such as minimax and bilevel formulations. While
various algorithms have been proposed, existing methods and analyses lack
adaptivity in stochastic optimization settings: they cannot achieve optimal
convergence rates across a wide spectrum of gradient noise levels without prior
knowledge of the noise magnitude. In this paper, we propose novel adaptive
algorithms for two important classes of stochastic hierarchical optimization
problems: nonconvex-strongly-concave minimax optimization and
nonconvex-strongly-convex bilevel optimization. Our algorithms achieve sharp
convergence rates of $\widetilde{O}(1/\sqrt{T} + \sqrt{\bar{\sigma}}/T^{1/4})$
in $T$ iterations for the gradient norm, where $\bar{\sigma}$ is an upper bound
on the stochastic gradient noise. Notably, these rates are obtained without
prior knowledge of the noise level, thereby enabling automatic adaptivity in
both low and high-noise regimes. To our knowledge, this work provides the first
adaptive and sharp convergence guarantees for stochastic hierarchical
optimization. Our algorithm design combines the momentum normalization
technique with novel adaptive parameter choices. Extensive experiments on
synthetic and deep learning tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed
algorithms.

Method: 提出DA-IBC方法：1）通过扰动专家动作形成IBC训练的反例；2）使用更好的初始化进行无导数推理。在CARLA模拟器中使用鸟瞰图输入进行实验。

Result: DA-IBC在评估多模态行为学习的城市驾驶任务中优于标准IBC。学习的能量景观能够表示多模态动作分布，而BC无法实现这一点。

Conclusion: DA-IBC方法有效解决了多模态驾驶决策学习问题，通过数据增强和改进推理策略显著提升了隐式行为克隆的性能。

Abstract: Standard Behavior Cloning (BC) fails to learn multimodal driving decisions,
where multiple valid actions exist for the same scenario. We explore Implicit
Behavioral Cloning (IBC) with Energy-Based Models (EBMs) to better capture this
multimodality. We propose Data-Augmented IBC (DA-IBC), which improves learning
by perturbing expert actions to form the counterexamples of IBC training and
using better initialization for derivative-free inference. Experiments in the
CARLA simulator with Bird's-Eye View inputs demonstrate that DA-IBC outperforms
standard IBC in urban driving tasks designed to evaluate multimodal behavior
learning in a test environment. The learned energy landscapes are able to
represent multimodal action distributions, which BC fails to achieve.

Motivation: 在可解释机器学习中，准确排名重要特征是一个基本挑战，但在特征选择和特征重要性之外，专门针对特征排名的问题关注较少。

Abstract: Accurate ranking of important features is a fundamental challenge in
interpretable machine learning with critical applications in scientific
discovery and decision-making. Unlike feature selection and feature importance,
the specific problem of ranking important features has received considerably
less attention. We introduce RAMPART (Ranked Attributions with MiniPatches And
Recursive Trimming), a framework that utilizes any existing feature importance
measure in a novel algorithm specifically tailored for ranking the top-$k$
features. Our approach combines an adaptive sequential halving strategy that
progressively focuses computational resources on promising features with an
efficient ensembling technique using both observation and feature subsampling.
Unlike existing methods that convert importance scores to ranks as
post-processing, our framework explicitly optimizes for ranking accuracy. We
provide theoretical guarantees showing that RAMPART achieves the correct
top-$k$ ranking with high probability under mild conditions, and demonstrate
through extensive simulation studies that RAMPART consistently outperforms
popular feature importance methods, concluding with a high-dimensional genomics
case study.

Motivation: 单细胞RNA测序数据噪声大、变异性强，传统PCA方法虽然稳健但存在局限性，需要改进以适应异质性数据集和不断发展的技术。

Method: 开发基于随机矩阵理论的稀疏PCA方法，引入新颖的双白化技术（受Sinkhorn-Knopp算法启发）同时稳定基因和细胞的方差，自动选择稀疏度参数。

Conclusion: 该方法在保持PCA可解释性的同时，实现了稳健、无需手动干预的稀疏主成分推断，为单细胞数据分析提供了更优的降维解决方案。

Abstract: Single-cell RNA-seq provides detailed molecular snapshots of individual cells
but is notoriously noisy. Variability stems from biological differences, PCR
amplification bias, limited sequencing depth, and low capture efficiency,
making it challenging to adapt computational pipelines to heterogeneous
datasets or evolving technologies. As a result, most studies still rely on
principal component analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction, valued for its
interpretability and robustness. Here, we improve upon PCA with a Random Matrix
Theory (RMT)-based approach that guides the inference of sparse principal
components using existing sparse PCA algorithms. We first introduce a novel
biwhitening method, inspired by the Sinkhorn-Knopp algorithm, that
simultaneously stabilizes variance across genes and cells. This enables the use
of an RMT-based criterion to automatically select the sparsity level, rendering
sparse PCA nearly parameter-free. Our mathematically grounded approach retains
the interpretability of PCA while enabling robust, hands-off inference of
sparse principal components. Across seven single-cell RNA-seq technologies and
four sparse PCA algorithms, we show that this method systematically improves
the reconstruction of the principal subspace and consistently outperforms PCA-,
autoencoder-, and diffusion-based methods in cell-type classification tasks.

Abstract: Transformers and their attention mechanism have been revolutionary in the
field of Machine Learning. While originally proposed for the language data,
they quickly found their way to the image, video, graph, etc. data modalities
with various signal geometries. Despite this versatility, generalizing the
attention mechanism to scenarios where data is presented at different scales
from potentially different modalities is not straightforward. The attempts to
incorporate hierarchy and multi-modality within transformers are largely based
on ad hoc heuristics, which are not seamlessly generalizable to similar
problems with potentially different structures. To address this problem, in
this paper, we take a fundamentally different approach: we first propose a
mathematical construct to represent multi-modal, multi-scale data. We then
mathematically derive the neural attention mechanics for the proposed construct
from the first principle of entropy minimization. We show that the derived
formulation is optimal in the sense of being the closest to the standard
Softmax attention while incorporating the inductive biases originating from the
hierarchical/geometric information of the problem. We further propose an
efficient algorithm based on dynamic programming to compute our derived
attention mechanism. By incorporating it within transformers, we show that the
proposed hierarchical attention mechanism not only can be employed to train
transformer models in hierarchical/multi-modal settings from scratch, but it
can also be used to inject hierarchical information into classical, pre-trained
transformer models post training, resulting in more efficient models in
zero-shot manner.

TL;DR: 本文提出了SPQE和IMPQ两种创新方法，通过将混合精度量化问题建模为层间合作博弈，利用Shapley值评估层敏感性和层间交互，在严格内存约束下实现2-4位精度的优化分配，显著提升低精度量化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型参数量巨大，难以在资源受限设备上部署。现有混合精度量化方法在平均精度低于4位时效果不佳，因为它们依赖孤立的层级指标，忽略了影响整体性能的关键层间交互。

Method: 1. 将混合精度量化问题建模为层间合作博弈，提出SPQE方法高效获取层敏感性和层间交互的Shapley估计值；2. 基于SPQE提出IMPQ方法，将Shapley估计转化为二进制二次优化问题，在内存约束下为各层分配2或4位精度。

Result: 在Llama-3、Gemma-2和Qwen-3模型上的实验表明，IMPQ在4位到2位的平均精度范围内，相比最佳基线方法将困惑度降低了20%到80%，且随着位宽收紧，优势更加明显。

Conclusion: IMPQ方法通过考虑层间交互效应，在低精度量化场景下显著优于仅依赖孤立指标的方法，证明了层间交互在混合精度量化中的重要性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) promise impressive capabilities, yet their
multi-billion-parameter scale makes on-device or low-resource deployment
prohibitive. Mixed-precision quantization offers a compelling solution, but
existing methods struggle when the average precision drops below four bits, as
they rely on isolated, layer-specific metrics that overlook critical
inter-layer interactions affecting overall performance. In this paper, we
propose two innovations to address these limitations. First, we frame the
mixed-precision quantization problem as a cooperative game among layers and
introduce Shapley-based Progressive Quantization Estimation (SPQE) to
efficiently obtain accurate Shapley estimates of layer sensitivities and
inter-layer interactions. Second, building upon SPQE, we propose
Interaction-aware Mixed-Precision Quantization (IMPQ) which translates these
Shapley estimates into a binary quadratic optimization formulation, assigning
either 2 or 4-bit precision to layers under strict memory constraints.
Comprehensive experiments conducted on Llama-3, Gemma-2, and Qwen-3 models
across three independent PTQ backends (Quanto, HQQ, GPTQ) demonstrate IMPQ's
scalability and consistently superior performance compared to methods relying
solely on isolated metrics. Across average precisions spanning 4 bit down to 2
bit, IMPQ cuts Perplexity by 20 to 80 percent relative to the best baseline,
with the margin growing as the bit-width tightens.

snapshot of the KG and overlook the temporal dynamics and factual
inconsistencies inherent in real-world data. To address the challenge of
reasoning over temporally shifting knowledge, we propose EvoReasoner, a
temporal-aware multi-hop reasoning algorithm that performs global-local entity
grounding, multi-route decomposition, and temporally grounded scoring. To
ensure that the underlying KG remains accurate and up-to-date, we introduce
EvoKG, a noise-tolerant KG evolution module that incrementally updates the KG
from unstructured documents through confidence-based contradiction resolution
and temporal trend tracking. We evaluate our approach on temporal QA benchmarks
and a novel end-to-end setting where the KG is dynamically updated from raw
documents. Our method outperforms both prompting-based and KG-enhanced
baselines, effectively narrowing the gap between small and large LLMs on
dynamic question answering. Notably, an 8B-parameter model using our approach
matches the performance of a 671B model prompted seven months later. These
results highlight the importance of combining temporal reasoning with KG
evolution for robust and up-to-date LLM performance. Our code is publicly
available at github.com/junhongmit/TREK.

TL;DR: SolarCAST是一个仅使用历史GHI数据的因果感知太阳能预测模型，无需卫星或天空相机图像，通过神经网络组件建模三类混杂因素，在多样化地理条件下优于现有方法，比顶级商业预测器Solcast误差降低25.9%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确的太阳能预测对可再生能源管理至关重要。现有方法依赖需要专业硬件和繁重预处理的卫星或天空相机图像，而SolarCAST旨在仅使用公开传感器数据提供高精度预测。

Method: SolarCAST使用可扩展的神经网络组件建模三类混杂因素：(i)可观察同步变量（如时间、站点身份）通过嵌入模块处理；(ii)潜在同步因素（如区域天气模式）通过时空图神经网络捕获；(iii)时间滞后影响（如云层移动）通过门控变换器建模时间偏移。

Conclusion: SolarCAST提供了一个轻量级、实用且可推广的局部太阳能预测解决方案，仅需公开传感器数据即可实现高精度预测。

Abstract: Accurate solar forecasting underpins effective renewable energy management.
We present SolarCAST, a causally informed model predicting future global
horizontal irradiance (GHI) at a target site using only historical GHI from
site X and nearby stations S - unlike prior work that relies on sky-camera or
satellite imagery requiring specialized hardware and heavy preprocessing. To
deliver high accuracy with only public sensor data, SolarCAST models three
classes of confounding factors behind X-S correlations using scalable neural
components: (i) observable synchronous variables (e.g., time of day, station
identity), handled via an embedding module; (ii) latent synchronous factors
(e.g., regional weather patterns), captured by a spatio-temporal graph neural
network; and (iii) time-lagged influences (e.g., cloud movement across
stations), modeled with a gated transformer that learns temporal shifts. It
outperforms leading time-series and multimodal baselines across diverse
geographical conditions, and achieves a 25.9% error reduction over the top
commercial forecaster, Solcast. SolarCAST offers a lightweight, practical, and
generalizable solution for localized solar forecasting.

TL;DR: FRAUDGUESS是一个金融欺诈检测系统，既能识别已知欺诈类型，又能发现新型欺诈模式，并通过可视化提供证据支持


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统分类器只能识别已知欺诈类型，但无法发现新型欺诈行为，且缺乏对检测结果的解释和证据支持

Method: 使用精心设计的特征空间中的微聚类来发现新型欺诈，通过可视化、热图和交互式仪表板提供证据和深入分析

Result: 在真实百万级金融数据集上发现了三种新行为，其中两种被领域专家认定为欺诈或可疑，捕获了数百个原本会被忽略的欺诈交易

Conclusion: FRAUDGUESS在实际应用中有效，目前正在匿名金融机构考虑部署，证明了其在欺诈检测和证据提供方面的实用性

Abstract: Given a set of financial transactions (who buys from whom, when, and for how
much), as well as prior information from buyers and sellers, how can we find
fraudulent transactions? If we have labels for some transactions for known
types of fraud, we can build a classifier. However, we also want to find new
types of fraud, still unknown to the domain experts ('Detection'). Moreover, we
also want to provide evidence to experts that supports our opinion
('Justification'). In this paper, we propose FRAUDGUESS, to achieve two goals:
(a) for 'Detection', it spots new types of fraud as micro-clusters in a
carefully designed feature space; (b) for 'Justification', it uses
visualization and heatmaps for evidence, as well as an interactive dashboard
for deep dives. FRAUDGUESS is used in real life and is currently considered for
deployment in an Anonymous Financial Institution (AFI). Thus, we also present
the three new behaviors that FRAUDGUESS discovered in a real, million-scale
financial dataset. Two of these behaviors are deemed fraudulent or suspicious
by domain experts, catching hundreds of fraudulent transactions that would
otherwise go un-noticed.

Motivation: 现有隐式神经表示方法在受限的紧凑网络尺寸下，难以准确表示科学数据中常见的多尺度结构、高频信息和精细纹理。

Method: 提出小波启发的多尺度架构，在不同分辨率尺度上分布建模，并在最精细尺度使用专门的核网络来恢复细微细节。

Conclusion: WIEN-INR为高保真科学数据编码提供了一个实用的神经表示框架，扩展了INR在需要高效保留精细细节领域的适用性。

Abstract: Implicit neural representations (INRs) have emerged as a compact and
parametric alternative to discrete array-based data representations, encoding
information directly in neural network weights to enable resolution-independent
representation and memory efficiency. However, existing INR approaches, when
constrained to compact network sizes, struggle to faithfully represent the
multi-scale structures, high-frequency information, and fine textures that
characterize the majority of scientific datasets. To address this limitation,
we propose WIEN-INR, a wavelet-informed implicit neural representation that
distributes modeling across different resolution scales and employs a
specialized kernel network at the finest scale to recover subtle details. This
multi-scale architecture allows for the use of smaller networks to retain the
full spectrum of information while preserving the training efficiency and
reducing storage cost. Through extensive experiments on diverse scientific
datasets spanning different scales and structural complexities, WIEN-INR
achieves superior reconstruction fidelity while maintaining a compact model
size. These results demonstrate WIEN-INR as a practical neural representation
framework for high-fidelity scientific data encoding, extending the
applicability of INRs to domains where efficient preservation of fine detail is
essential.

Conclusion: 该方法计算效率高，具有可解释性，并通过理论保证约束了吸引力动态及其对注意力漂移的影响

Abstract: Transformers have emerged as a compelling architecture for sequential
decision-making by modeling trajectories via self-attention. In reinforcement
learning (RL), they enable return-conditioned control without relying on value
function approximation. Decision Transformers (DTs) exploit this by casting RL
as supervised sequence modeling, but they are restricted to offline data and
lack exploration. Online Decision Transformers (ODTs) address this limitation
through entropy-regularized training on on-policy rollouts, offering a stable
alternative to traditional RL methods like Soft Actor-Critic, which depend on
bootstrapped targets and reward shaping. Despite these advantages, ODTs use
standard attention, which lacks explicit memory of action-specific outcomes.
This leads to inefficiencies in learning long-term action effectiveness.
Inspired by cognitive models such as Experience-Weighted Attraction (EWA), we
propose Experience-Weighted Attraction with Vector Quantization for Online
Decision Transformers (EWA-VQ-ODT), a lightweight module that maintains
per-action mental accounts summarizing recent successes and failures.
Continuous actions are routed via direct grid lookup to a compact
vector-quantized codebook, where each code stores a scalar attraction updated
online through decay and reward-based reinforcement. These attractions modulate
attention by biasing the columns associated with action tokens, requiring no
change to the backbone or training objective. On standard continuous-control
benchmarks, EWA-VQ-ODT improves sample efficiency and average return over ODT,
particularly in early training. The module is computationally efficient,
interpretable via per-code traces, and supported by theoretical guarantees that
bound the attraction dynamics and its impact on attention drift.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 许多应用问题涉及具有一般损失函数和未知参数的MDPs，需要处理与未知参数相关的认知不确定性。贝叶斯方法用于从数据中估计参数，并对损失施加相干风险泛函。

Method: 提出策略梯度优化方法，利用相干风险测度的对偶表示，并将包络定理扩展到连续情况。算法包括平稳分析和扩展到情景设置。

Result: 算法收敛速度为O(T^{-1/2}+r^{-1/2})，其中T是策略梯度迭代次数，r是梯度估计器样本大小。在情景设置中实现了全局收敛，达到误差界O(ε)所需的迭代次数有界。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了传统动态规划不适用的问题，为具有未知参数和风险敏感目标的MDPs提供了可行的优化框架。

Abstract: Motivated by many application problems, we consider Markov decision processes
(MDPs) with a general loss function and unknown parameters. To mitigate the
epistemic uncertainty associated with unknown parameters, we take a Bayesian
approach to estimate the parameters from data and impose a coherent risk
functional (with respect to the Bayesian posterior distribution) on the loss.
Since this formulation usually does not satisfy the interchangeability
principle, it does not admit Bellman equations and cannot be solved by
approaches based on dynamic programming. Therefore, We propose a policy
gradient optimization method, leveraging the dual representation of coherent
risk measures and extending the envelope theorem to continuous cases. We then
show the stationary analysis of the algorithm with a convergence rate of
$O(T^{-1/2}+r^{-1/2})$, where $T$ is the number of policy gradient iterations
and $r$ is the sample size of the gradient estimator. We further extend our
algorithm to an episodic setting, and establish the global convergence of the
extended algorithm and provide bounds on the number of iterations needed to
achieve an error bound $O(\epsilon)$ in each episode.

Conclusion: KoopCast成功地将Koopman算子理论应用于轨迹预测，实现了准确性、可解释性和效率的良好平衡，为动态环境中的多智能体交互和地图约束非线性运动提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: We present KoopCast, a lightweight yet efficient model for trajectory
forecasting in general dynamic environments. Our approach leverages Koopman
operator theory, which enables a linear representation of nonlinear dynamics by
lifting trajectories into a higher-dimensional space. The framework follows a
two-stage design: first, a probabilistic neural goal estimator predicts
plausible long-term targets, specifying where to go; second, a Koopman
operator-based refinement module incorporates intention and history into a
nonlinear feature space, enabling linear prediction that dictates how to go.
This dual structure not only ensures strong predictive accuracy but also
inherits the favorable properties of linear operators while faithfully
capturing nonlinear dynamics. As a result, our model offers three key
advantages: (i) competitive accuracy, (ii) interpretability grounded in Koopman
spectral theory, and (iii) low-latency deployment. We validate these benefits
on ETH/UCY, the Waymo Open Motion Dataset, and nuScenes, which feature rich
multi-agent interactions and map-constrained nonlinear motion. Across
benchmarks, KoopCast consistently delivers high predictive accuracy together
with mode-level interpretability and practical efficiency.

Abstract: The manifold hypothesis suggests that high-dimensional data often lie on or
near a low-dimensional manifold. Estimating the dimension of this manifold is
essential for leveraging its structure, yet existing work on dimension
estimation is fragmented and lacks systematic evaluation. This article provides
a comprehensive survey for both researchers and practitioners. We review
often-overlooked theoretical foundations and present eight representative
estimators. Through controlled experiments, we analyze how individual factors
such as noise, curvature, and sample size affect performance. We also compare
the estimators on diverse synthetic and real-world datasets, introducing a
principled approach to dataset-specific hyperparameter tuning. Our results
offer practical guidance and suggest that, for a problem of this generality,
simpler methods often perform better.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为Dynamics-Aware Context (DAC)的新方法，用于解决完全去中心化多智能体强化学习中的非平稳性和相对过度泛化问题。该方法通过动态感知上下文建模，将局部任务动态归因于未观测上下文之间的切换，并引入基于上下文的价值函数和乐观边际价值来同时解决这两个问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在完全去中心化合作多智能体强化学习中，每个智能体只能观测自身状态、局部动作和共享奖励，无法访问其他智能体的动作。这导致价值函数更新时的非平稳性和价值函数估计时的相对过度泛化问题，阻碍了有效的合作策略学习。现有方法无法同时解决这两个问题。

Method: DAC方法将每个智能体感知的任务形式化为上下文马尔可夫决策过程，通过动态感知上下文建模解决非平稳性和相对过度泛化问题。具体包括：1）将非平稳局部任务动态归因于未观测上下文切换；2）使用潜在变量建模步进动态分布作为上下文；3）引入基于上下文的价值函数解决非平稳性；4）推导乐观边际价值促进合作动作选择。

Result: 在多种合作任务（包括矩阵游戏、捕食者-猎物游戏和SMAC）上的实验评估表明，DAC相对于多个基线方法表现出优越性能，验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: DAC方法成功解决了完全去中心化多智能体强化学习中的关键挑战，通过动态感知上下文建模同时处理了非平稳性和相对过度泛化问题，为去中心化合作学习提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: This paper studies fully decentralized cooperative multi-agent reinforcement
learning, where each agent solely observes the states, its local actions, and
the shared rewards. The inability to access other agents' actions often leads
to non-stationarity during value function updates and relative
overgeneralization during value function estimation, hindering effective
cooperative policy learning. However, existing works fail to address both
issues simultaneously, due to their inability to model the joint policy of
other agents in a fully decentralized setting. To overcome this limitation, we
propose a novel method named Dynamics-Aware Context (DAC), which formalizes the
task, as locally perceived by each agent, as an Contextual Markov Decision
Process, and further addresses both non-stationarity and relative
overgeneralization through dynamics-aware context modeling. Specifically, DAC
attributes the non-stationary local task dynamics of each agent to switches
between unobserved contexts, each corresponding to a distinct joint policy.
Then, DAC models the step-wise dynamics distribution using latent variables and
refers to them as contexts. For each agent, DAC introduces a context-based
value function to address the non-stationarity issue during value function
update. For value function estimation, an optimistic marginal value is derived
to promote the selection of cooperative actions, thereby addressing the
relative overgeneralization issue. Experimentally, we evaluate DAC on various
cooperative tasks (including matrix game, predator and prey, and SMAC), and its
superior performance against multiple baselines validates its effectiveness.

Conclusion: 该研究为同时满足通用逼近和解析置信传播要求的模型类别奠定了理论基础，为解决非线性随机系统推理问题提供了有效途径。

Abstract: Predicting the distribution of future states in a stochastic system, known as
belief propagation, is fundamental to reasoning under uncertainty. However,
nonlinear dynamics often make analytical belief propagation intractable,
requiring approximate methods. When the system model is unknown and must be
learned from data, a key question arises: can we learn a model that (i)
universally approximates general nonlinear stochastic dynamics, and (ii)
supports analytical belief propagation? This paper establishes the theoretical
foundations for a class of models that satisfy both properties. The proposed
approach combines the expressiveness of normalizing flows for density
estimation with the analytical tractability of Bernstein polynomials. Empirical
results show the efficacy of our learned model over state-of-the-art
data-driven methods for belief propagation, especially for highly non-linear
systems with non-additive, non-Gaussian noise.

Abstract: Existing decentralized stochastic optimization methods assume the lower-level
loss function is strongly convex and the stochastic gradient noise has finite
variance. These strong assumptions typically are not satisfied in real-world
machine learning models. To address these limitations, we develop a novel
decentralized stochastic bilevel optimization algorithm for the nonconvex
bilevel optimization problem under heavy-tailed noises. Specifically, we
develop a normalized stochastic variance-reduced bilevel gradient descent
algorithm, which does not rely on any clipping operation. Moreover, we
establish its convergence rate by innovatively bounding interdependent gradient
sequences under heavy-tailed noises for nonconvex decentralized bilevel
optimization problems. As far as we know, this is the first decentralized
bilevel optimization algorithm with rigorous theoretical guarantees under
heavy-tailed noises. The extensive experimental results confirm the
effectiveness of our algorithm in handling heavy-tailed noises.

Abstract: Synthetic image detectors (SIDs) are a key defense against the risks posed by
the growing realism of images from text-to-image (T2I) models. Red teaming
improves SID's effectiveness by identifying and exploiting their failure modes
via misclassified synthetic images. However, existing red-teaming solutions (i)
require white-box access to SIDs, which is infeasible for proprietary
state-of-the-art detectors, and (ii) generate image-specific attacks through
expensive online optimization. To address these limitations, we propose
PolyJuice, the first black-box, image-agnostic red-teaming method for SIDs,
based on an observed distribution shift in the T2I latent space between samples
correctly and incorrectly classified by the SID. PolyJuice generates attacks by
(i) identifying the direction of this shift through a lightweight offline
process that only requires black-box access to the SID, and (ii) exploiting
this direction by universally steering all generated images towards the SID's
failure modes. PolyJuice-steered T2I models are significantly more effective at
deceiving SIDs (up to 84%) compared to their unsteered counterparts. We also
show that the steering directions can be estimated efficiently at lower
resolutions and transferred to higher resolutions using simple interpolation,
reducing computational overhead. Finally, tuning SID models on
PolyJuice-augmented datasets notably enhances the performance of the detectors
(up to 30%).

TL;DR: 本文系统解决了零阶优化中的查询分配问题，发现查询聚合方法的选择决定了最优策略：简单平均法(ZO-Avg)单查询最优，而投影对齐法(ZO-Align)多查询更优


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 零阶优化中多查询方法能提高梯度估计精度，但面临查询预算分配的权衡问题：每次迭代查询数与总迭代次数成反比。如何最优分配查询预算是一个尚未深入探索的基础问题

Method: 分析了两种聚合方法：常用的简单平均法(ZO-Avg)和新提出的基于局部代理最小化的投影对齐法(ZO-Align)。通过推导收敛率，明确查询数对性能的影响

Result: 发现明显的二分现象：ZO-Avg使用多于一次查询总是查询效率低下，单查询方法最优；而ZO-Align通常多查询表现更好，全子空间估计是最优方法

Conclusion: 多查询问题的关键不是选择中间查询规模，而是在两种经典算法间选择，这一选择完全由使用的聚合方法决定。理论发现得到了大量实验验证

Abstract: Zeroth-order (ZO) optimization provides a powerful framework for problems
where explicit gradients are unavailable and have to be approximated using only
queries to function value. The prevalent single-query approach is simple, but
suffers from high estimation variance, motivating a multi-query paradigm to
improves estimation accuracy. This, however, creates a critical trade-off:
under a fixed budget of queries (i.e. cost), queries per iteration and the
total number of optimization iterations are inversely proportional to one
another. How to best allocate this budget is a fundamental, under-explored
question.
  This work systematically resolves this query allocation problem. We analyze
two aggregation methods: the de facto simple averaging (ZO-Avg), and a new
Projection Alignment method (ZO-Align) we derive from local surrogate
minimization. By deriving convergence rates for both methods that make the
dependence on the number of queries explicit across strongly convex, convex,
non-convex, and stochastic settings, we uncover a stark dichotomy: For ZO-Avg,
we prove that using more than one query per iteration is always
query-inefficient, rendering the single-query approach optimal. On the
contrary, ZO-Align generally performs better with more queries per iteration,
resulting in a full-subspace estimation as the optimal approach. Thus, our work
clarifies that the multi-query problem boils down to a choice not about an
intermediate query size, but between two classic algorithms, a choice dictated
entirely by the aggregation method used. These theoretical findings are also
consistently validated by extensive experiments.

Conclusion: 该方法朝着减少奖励黑客行为和提升RLVR模型可靠性的方向迈出了一步。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning from Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has recently shown that
large language models (LLMs) can develop their own reasoning without direct
supervision. However, applications in the medical domain, specifically for
question answering, are susceptible to significant reward hacking during the
reasoning phase. Our work addresses two primary forms of this behavior: i)
providing a final answer without preceding reasoning, and ii) employing
non-standard reasoning formats to exploit the reward mechanism. To mitigate
these, we introduce a composite reward function with specific penalties for
these behaviors. Our experiments show that extending RLVR with our proposed
reward model leads to better-formatted reasoning with less reward hacking and
good accuracy compared to the baselines. This approach marks a step toward
reducing reward hacking and enhancing the reliability of models utilizing RLVR.

Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have been explored for HPT, yet most
rely on models exceeding 100 billion parameters. We propose an Expert Block
Framework for HPT using Small LLMs. At its core is the Trajectory Context
Summarizer (TCS), a deterministic block that transforms raw training
trajectories into structured context, enabling small LLMs to analyze
optimization progress with reliability comparable to larger models. Using two
locally-run LLMs (phi4:reasoning14B and qwen2.5-coder:32B) and a 10-trial
budget, our TCS-enabled HPT pipeline achieves average performance within ~0.9
percentage points of GPT-4 across six diverse tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界数据中的复杂变异因素使得系统研究类别发现困难，许多关于新类别发现成功条件的基本问题尚未解答。

Method: 使用dSprites数据集构建控制实验框架，通过程序生成修改因子，研究已知/未知类别数量关系以及已知类别覆盖率对新类别发现的影响。

Result: 实验结果表明，已知类别数量的益处存在饱和点，超过该点后发现性能趋于平稳，呈现出边际收益递减的模式。

Conclusion: 这种边际收益递减模式为实践者提供了成本效益分析的见解，并为未来在复杂现实世界数据集上进行更严格的类别发现研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: Novel class discovery is essential for ML models to adapt to evolving
real-world data, with applications ranging from scientific discovery to
robotics. However, these datasets contain complex and entangled factors of
variation, making a systematic study of class discovery difficult. As a result,
many fundamental questions are yet to be answered on why and when new class
discoveries are more likely to be successful. To address this, we propose a
simple controlled experimental framework using the dSprites dataset with
procedurally generated modifying factors. This allows us to investigate what
influences successful class discovery. In particular, we study the relationship
between the number of known/unknown classes and discovery performance, as well
as the impact of known class 'coverage' on discovering new classes. Our
empirical results indicate that the benefit of the number of known classes
reaches a saturation point beyond which discovery performance plateaus. The
pattern of diminishing return across different settings provides an insight for
cost-benefit analysis for practitioners and a starting point for more rigorous
future research of class discovery on complex real-world datasets.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出Latent Zoning Network (LZN)统一框架，通过共享高斯潜在空间同时解决生成建模、表示学习和分类三大机器学习核心任务，在多个基准测试中取得SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前机器学习中生成建模、表示学习和分类三大核心任务的SOTA解决方案相互独立，缺乏统一框架。本文旨在探索能否用一个统一原则同时解决这三个问题，简化机器学习流程并促进任务间的协同效应。

Method: LZN创建共享高斯潜在空间，为每种数据类型（如图像、文本、标签）配备编码器和解码器。机器学习任务通过编码器和解码器的组合实现：例如标签条件图像生成使用标签编码器和图像解码器，图像嵌入使用图像编码器，分类使用图像编码器和标签解码器。

Result: 1) 与SOTA Rectified Flow模型结合，在CIFAR10上将FID从2.76提升至2.59；2) 在无监督表示学习中，在ImageNet下游线性分类上分别超越MoCo和SimCLR 9.3%和0.2%；3) 在CIFAR10上同时实现SOTA分类精度和改善的FID。

Conclusion: LZN证明了统一框架在解决多个机器学习任务方面的潜力，能够简化模型设计并实现任务间的协同优化，为构建更通用的机器学习系统提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: Generative modeling, representation learning, and classification are three
core problems in machine learning (ML), yet their state-of-the-art (SoTA)
solutions remain largely disjoint. In this paper, we ask: Can a unified
principle address all three? Such unification could simplify ML pipelines and
foster greater synergy across tasks. We introduce Latent Zoning Network (LZN)
as a step toward this goal. At its core, LZN creates a shared Gaussian latent
space that encodes information across all tasks. Each data type (e.g., images,
text, labels) is equipped with an encoder that maps samples to disjoint latent
zones, and a decoder that maps latents back to data. ML tasks are expressed as
compositions of these encoders and decoders: for example, label-conditional
image generation uses a label encoder and image decoder; image embedding uses
an image encoder; classification uses an image encoder and label decoder. We
demonstrate the promise of LZN in three increasingly complex scenarios: (1) LZN
can enhance existing models (image generation): When combined with the SoTA
Rectified Flow model, LZN improves FID on CIFAR10 from 2.76 to 2.59-without
modifying the training objective. (2) LZN can solve tasks independently
(representation learning): LZN can implement unsupervised representation
learning without auxiliary loss functions, outperforming the seminal MoCo and
SimCLR methods by 9.3% and 0.2%, respectively, on downstream linear
classification on ImageNet. (3) LZN can solve multiple tasks simultaneously
(joint generation and classification): With image and label encoders/decoders,
LZN performs both tasks jointly by design, improving FID and achieving SoTA
classification accuracy on CIFAR10. The code and trained models are available

Motivation: 现实世界数据需要复杂模型才能达到竞争性能，但牺牲了可解释性。在高风险应用（如医疗保健）中部署机器学习模型，促使寻找准确且可解释的预测方法。

Method: 提出个性化预测方案，为每个查询学习易于解释的预测器；使用半空间表示子群体；结合参考类学习算法和稀疏线性表示列表学习器。

Result: 证明了稀疏线性分类器和齐次半空间子集的个性化预测的第一个上界O(opt^{1/4})；在标准基准数据集上评估了算法。

Conclusion: 该工作研究了在标签无关设置下，由半空间表示的子群体的个性化预测模型的PAC可学习性，为可解释机器学习提供了理论保证。

Abstract: In machine learning applications, predictive models are trained to serve
future queries across the entire data distribution. Real-world data often
demands excessively complex models to achieve competitive performance, however,
sacrificing interpretability. Hence, the growing deployment of machine learning
models in high-stakes applications, such as healthcare, motivates the search
for methods for accurate and explainable predictions. This work proposes a
Personalized Prediction scheme, where an easy-to-interpret predictor is learned
per query. In particular, we wish to produce a "sparse linear" classifier with
competitive performance specifically on some sub-population that includes the
query point. The goal of this work is to study the PAC-learnability of this
prediction model for sub-populations represented by "halfspaces" in a
label-agnostic setting. We first give a distribution-specific PAC-learning
algorithm for learning reference classes for personalized prediction. By
leveraging both the reference-class learning algorithm and a list learner of
sparse linear representations, we prove the first upper bound,
$O(\mathrm{opt}^{1/4} )$, for personalized prediction with sparse linear
classifiers and homogeneous halfspace subsets. We also evaluate our algorithms
on a variety of standard benchmark data sets.

Conclusion: 自动化摘要有潜力改善在线新闻平台的内容管理系统，实现更高效的内容组织和更好的用户体验

Abstract: In the age of information overload, content management for online news
articles relies on efficient summarization to enhance accessibility and user
engagement. This article addresses the challenge of extractive text
summarization by employing advanced machine learning techniques to generate
concise and coherent summaries while preserving the original meaning. Using the
Cornell Newsroom dataset, comprising 1.3 million article-summary pairs, we
developed a pipeline leveraging BERT embeddings to transform textual data into
numerical representations. By framing the task as a binary classification
problem, we explored various models, including logistic regression,
feed-forward neural networks, and long short-term memory (LSTM) networks. Our
findings demonstrate that LSTM networks, with their ability to capture
sequential dependencies, outperform baseline methods like Lede-3 and simpler
models in F1 score and ROUGE-1 metrics. This study underscores the potential of
automated summarization in improving content management systems for online news
platforms, enabling more efficient content organization and enhanced user
experiences.

Motivation: 强调信息几何和贝叶斯这两个领域的共同起源，希望促进两个领域交叉点的更多研究工作。

Method: 使用Khan和Rue（2023）的自然梯度下降算法，称为贝叶斯学习规则（BLR），来展示这一联系的结果。

Result: 展示了三个主要结果：（i）贝叶斯规则简化为自然梯度的加法；（ii）梯度方法中二次代理函数的推广；（iii）针对大语言模型的大规模变分贝叶斯算法实现。

Conclusion: 虽然这种联系及其结果并非全新发现，但进一步强调了信息几何和贝叶斯领域的共同起源，有望促进两个交叉领域的更多研究。

Abstract: We highlight a fundamental connection between information geometry and
variational Bayes (VB) and discuss its consequences for machine learning. Under
certain conditions, a VB solution always requires estimation or computation of
natural gradients. We show several consequences of this fact by using the
natural-gradient descent algorithm of Khan and Rue (2023) called the Bayesian
Learning Rule (BLR). These include (i) a simplification of Bayes' rule as
addition of natural gradients, (ii) a generalization of quadratic surrogates
used in gradient-based methods, and (iii) a large-scale implementation of VB
algorithms for large language models. Neither the connection nor its
consequences are new but we further emphasize the common origins of the two
fields of information geometry and Bayes with a hope to facilitate more work at
the intersection of the two fields.

Motivation: 影响函数可以量化训练数据点对模型性能的影响，但现有方法计算和内存成本过高，尤其对于大规模模型，即使使用近似方法也难以应用。

Method: 通过将dropout作为梯度压缩机制，在影响函数计算过程中减少梯度存储和计算需求，同时保持数据影响的关键成分。

Result: 理论分析和实证验证表明，该方法能显著降低计算和内存开销，同时保持影响函数的有效性，使其能够应用于现代大规模模型。

Conclusion: 提出的dropout梯度压缩方法为大规模模型的影响函数计算提供了可行的解决方案，增强了模型透明度和训练数据选择能力。

Abstract: Assessing the impact the training data on machine learning models is crucial
for understanding the behavior of the model, enhancing the transparency, and
selecting training data. Influence function provides a theoretical framework
for quantifying the effect of training data points on model's performance given
a specific test data. However, the computational and memory costs of influence
function presents significant challenges, especially for large-scale models,
even when using approximation methods, since the gradients involved in
computation are as large as the model itself. In this work, we introduce a
novel approach that leverages dropout as a gradient compression mechanism to
compute the influence function more efficiently. Our method significantly
reduces computational and memory overhead, not only during the influence
function computation but also in gradient compression process. Through
theoretical analysis and empirical validation, we demonstrate that our method
could preserves critical components of the data influence and enables its
application to modern large-scale models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决传统正则化方案中固有的估计偏差问题，特别是在存在大量噪声特征的情况下，需要开发更有效的特征选择方法。

Method: 将策略评估扩展到经典最小二乘时序差分框架中，使用稀疏诱导的非凸投影极小极大凹惩罚来制定贝尔曼残差目标，并将其视为一般非单调包含问题的特例。

Result: 在基准数据集上的数值实验表明，该方法显著优于最先进的特征选择方法，特别是在具有许多噪声特征的场景中。

Conclusion: 提出的方法通过结合PMC惩罚和FRBS算法，为强化学习中的特征选择提供了有效的解决方案，具有理论收敛保证和优异的实际性能。

Abstract: This work proposes an efficient batch algorithm for feature selection in
reinforcement learning (RL) with theoretical convergence guarantees. To
mitigate the estimation bias inherent in conventional regularization schemes,
the first contribution extends policy evaluation within the classical
least-squares temporal-difference (LSTD) framework by formulating a
Bellman-residual objective regularized with the sparsity-inducing, nonconvex
projected minimax concave (PMC) penalty. Owing to the weak convexity of the PMC
penalty, this formulation can be interpreted as a special instance of a general
nonmonotone-inclusion problem. The second contribution establishes novel
convergence conditions for the forward-reflected-backward splitting (FRBS)
algorithm to solve this class of problems. Numerical experiments on benchmark
datasets demonstrate that the proposed approach substantially outperforms
state-of-the-art feature-selection methods, particularly in scenarios with many
noisy features.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在边缘智能系统中，假阴性错误比假阳性错误的代价更高，需要平衡分类准确性和网络卸载成本。现有方法缺乏对这种权衡的系统性优化。

Method: 提出H2T2在线学习框架，通过动态调整本地模型置信度阈值来决定是本地分类还是卸载到远程模型。对于校准模型有闭式解，对于未校准模型提出两阈值策略并证明其具有次线性遗憾。

Result: 在真实数据集上的仿真表明，H2T2始终优于朴素和单阈值策略，有时甚至超过离线最优解，对分布偏移具有鲁棒性，并能有效适应不匹配的分类器。

Conclusion: H2T2提供了一种模型无关、无需训练、在推理阶段学习的有效方法，解决了边缘智能系统中分类准确性与成本权衡的关键问题。

Abstract: We focus on a binary classification problem in an edge intelligence system
where false negatives are more costly than false positives. The system has a
compact, locally deployed model, which is supplemented by a larger, remote
model, which is accessible via the network by incurring an offloading cost. For
each sample, our system first uses the locally deployed model for inference.
Based on the output of the local model, the sample may be offloaded to the
remote model. This work aims to understand the fundamental trade-off between
classification accuracy and these offloading costs within such a hierarchical
inference (HI) system. To optimize this system, we propose an online learning
framework that continuously adapts a pair of thresholds on the local model's
confidence scores. These thresholds determine the prediction of the local model
and whether a sample is classified locally or offloaded to the remote model. We
present a closed-form solution for the setting where the local model is
calibrated. For the more general case of uncalibrated models, we introduce
H2T2, an online two-threshold hierarchical inference policy, and prove it
achieves sublinear regret. H2T2 is model-agnostic, requires no training, and
learns in the inference phase using limited feedback. Simulations on real-world
datasets show that H2T2 consistently outperforms naive and single-threshold HI
policies, sometimes even surpassing offline optima. The policy also
demonstrates robustness to distribution shifts and adapts effectively to
mismatched classifiers.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于信息理论的原则性方法，用于在上下文学习中优化示例选择，通过查询特定的优化问题和近似子模算法，显著提升了ICL性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于最近邻的示例选择方法（如KATE）在高维嵌入空间中存在泛化能力差和多样性不足的问题，需要更有效的示例选择策略来最大化ICL性能。

Method: 将LLM建模为输入嵌入的线性函数，将示例选择构建为查询特定的优化问题，推导出近似子模的代理目标函数，并采用贪心算法。通过核技巧处理高维特征空间，并引入基于最优设计的正则化器来增强多样性。

Result: 在一系列分类任务上，相比标准检索方法取得了显著改进，证明了结构感知和多样性示例选择在真实世界标签稀缺场景中的优势。

Conclusion: 基于信息理论的原则性示例选择方法能够有效提升ICL性能，特别是在标签稀缺的实际应用场景中，为LLM的上下文学习提供了更优化的解决方案。

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for adapting
large language models (LLMs) to new and data-scarce tasks using only a few
carefully selected task-specific examples presented in the prompt. However,
given the limited context size of LLMs, a fundamental question arises: Which
examples should be selected to maximize performance on a given user query?
While nearest-neighbor-based methods like KATE have been widely adopted for
this purpose, they suffer from well-known drawbacks in high-dimensional
embedding spaces, including poor generalization and a lack of diversity. In
this work, we study this problem of example selection in ICL from a principled,
information theory-driven perspective. We first model an LLM as a linear
function over input embeddings and frame the example selection task as a
query-specific optimization problem: selecting a subset of exemplars from a
larger example bank that minimizes the prediction error on a specific query.
This formulation departs from traditional generalization-focused learning
theoretic approaches by targeting accurate prediction for a specific query
instance. We derive a principled surrogate objective that is approximately
submodular, enabling the use of a greedy algorithm with an approximation
guarantee. We further enhance our method by (i) incorporating the kernel trick
to operate in high-dimensional feature spaces without explicit mappings, and
(ii) introducing an optimal design-based regularizer to encourage diversity in
the selected examples. Empirically, we demonstrate significant improvements
over standard retrieval methods across a suite of classification tasks,
highlighting the benefits of structure-aware, diverse example selection for ICL
in real-world, label-scarce scenarios.

TL;DR: RMT-KD是一种基于随机矩阵理论的知识蒸馏压缩方法，通过保留隐藏表示的光谱特性来识别信息方向，实现深度网络的高效压缩。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型深度学习模型（如BERT和ResNet）在边缘设备上部署成本高，需要一种数学基础扎实的压缩方法来减少模型大小和计算需求。

Method: 采用随机矩阵理论进行知识蒸馏，通过逐层应用基于RMT的因果缩减和自蒸馏来保持稳定性和准确性，避免剪枝或启发式秩选择。

Result: 在GLUE、AG News和CIFAR-10数据集上，RMT-KD实现了80%的参数减少，仅损失2%的准确率，推理速度提升2.8倍，功耗降低近一半。

Conclusion: RMT-KD作为一种数学基础扎实的网络蒸馏方法，在保持性能的同时显著提升了模型效率。

Abstract: Large deep learning models such as BERT and ResNet achieve state-of-the-art
performance but are costly to deploy at the edge due to their size and compute
demands. We present RMT-KD, a compression method that leverages Random Matrix
Theory (RMT) for knowledge distillation to iteratively reduce network size.
Instead of pruning or heuristic rank selection, RMT-KD preserves only
informative directions identified via the spectral properties of hidden
representations. RMT-based causal reduction is applied layer by layer with
self-distillation to maintain stability and accuracy. On GLUE, AG News, and
CIFAR-10, RMT-KD achieves up to 80% parameter reduction with only 2% accuracy
loss, delivering 2.8x faster inference and nearly halved power consumption.
These results establish RMT-KD as a mathematically grounded approach to network
distillation.

Motivation: 大型语言模型容易产生幻觉和分布外错误，需要一种能够实时检测这些错误的方法，同时保持可解释性和高效性。

Method: 使用隐藏激活的谱几何作为模型动态的全局签名，通过流式协方差谱统计（如熵、特征值间隙和KL散度）输入轻量级循环分类器，跟踪表示结构的时间变化。

Result: EigenTrack能够在表面错误出现之前检测到幻觉和分布外漂移，仅需单次前向传播，无需重采样，并保持时间上下文和全局信号聚合。

Conclusion: EigenTrack提供了一种可解释的准确度-延迟权衡，优于现有的黑盒、灰盒和白盒检测方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) offer broad utility but remain prone to
hallucination and out-of-distribution (OOD) errors. We propose EigenTrack, an
interpretable real-time detector that uses the spectral geometry of hidden
activations, a compact global signature of model dynamics. By streaming
covariance-spectrum statistics such as entropy, eigenvalue gaps, and KL
divergence from random baselines into a lightweight recurrent classifier,
EigenTrack tracks temporal shifts in representation structure that signal
hallucination and OOD drift before surface errors appear. Unlike black- and
grey-box methods, it needs only a single forward pass without resampling.
Unlike existing white-box detectors, it preserves temporal context, aggregates
global signals, and offers interpretable accuracy-latency trade-offs.

Abstract: Accurate modelling of aircraft fuel-flow is crucial for both operational
planning and environmental impact assessment, yet standard parametric models
often neglect performance deterioration that occurs as aircraft age. This paper
investigates multiple approaches to integrate engine ageing effects into
fuel-flow prediction for the Airbus A320-214, using a comprehensive dataset of
approximately nineteen thousand Quick Access Recorder flights from nine
distinct airframes with varying years in service. We systematically evaluate
classical physics-based models, empirical correction coefficients, and
data-driven neural network architectures that incorporate age either as an
input feature or as an explicit multiplicative bias. Results demonstrate that
while baseline models consistently underestimate fuel consumption for older
aircraft, the use of age-dependent correction factors and neural models
substantially reduces bias and improves prediction accuracy. Nevertheless,
limitations arise from the small number of airframes and the lack of detailed
maintenance event records, which constrain the representativeness and
generalization of age-based corrections. This study emphasizes the importance
of accounting for the effects of ageing in parametric and machine learning
frameworks to improve the reliability of operational and environmental
assessments. The study also highlights the need for more diverse datasets that
can capture the complexity of real-world engine deterioration.

Conclusion: GUI-ReWalk为GUI智能体研究提供了一个可扩展且数据高效的数据生成框架，能够推动稳健的实时自动化应用发展。

Abstract: Graphical User Interface (GUI) Agents, powered by large language and
vision-language models, hold promise for enabling end-to-end automation in
digital environments. However, their progress is fundamentally constrained by
the scarcity of scalable, high-quality trajectory data. Existing data
collection strategies either rely on costly and inconsistent manual annotations
or on synthetic generation methods that trade off between diversity and
meaningful task coverage. To bridge this gap, we present GUI-ReWalk: a
reasoning-enhanced, multi-stage framework for synthesizing realistic and
diverse GUI trajectories. GUI-ReWalk begins with a stochastic exploration phase
that emulates human trial-and-error behaviors, and progressively transitions
into a reasoning-guided phase where inferred goals drive coherent and
purposeful interactions. Moreover, it supports multi-stride task generation,
enabling the construction of long-horizon workflows across multiple
applications. By combining randomness for diversity with goal-aware reasoning
for structure, GUI-ReWalk produces data that better reflects the intent-aware,
adaptive nature of human-computer interaction. We further train Qwen2.5-VL-7B
on the GUI-ReWalk dataset and evaluate it across multiple benchmarks, including
Screenspot-Pro, OSWorld-G, UI-Vision, AndroidControl, and GUI-Odyssey. Results
demonstrate that GUI-ReWalk enables superior coverage of diverse interaction
flows, higher trajectory entropy, and more realistic user intent. These
findings establish GUI-ReWalk as a scalable and data-efficient framework for
advancing GUI agent research and enabling robust real-world automation.

post-deployment every time new data distribution is encountered. Hence, there
is a need for an online ML approach where the model can adapt to varying
distributions. However, existing online incremental multistep forecasts are a
great challenge as there is no way to correct the model of its forecasts at the
current instance. Also, these methods need to wait for a considerable amount of
time to acquire enough streaming data before retraining. In this study, we
propose iFSNet (incremental Fast and Slow learning Network) which is a modified
version of FSNet for a single-pass mode (sample-by-sample) to achieve multistep
forecasting using pseudo targets. It uses a simple linear regressor of the
input sequence to extrapolate pseudo future samples (pseudo targets) and
calculate the loss from the rest of the forecast and keep updating the model.
The model benefits from the associative memory and adaptive structure
mechanisms of FSNet, at the same time the model incrementally improves by using
pseudo targets. The proposed model achieved 0.00197 RMSE and 0.00154 MAE on
datasets with smooth degradation trajectories while it achieved 0.01588 RMSE
and 0.01234 MAE on datasets having irregular degradation trajectories with
capacity regeneration spikes.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种通过优化KL散度来引导特征分布或LLM内部表示的方法，以解决公平机器学习中的'偏见输入偏见输出'问题，确保模型输出具有可证明的公平性保证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决公平机器学习中'偏见输入偏见输出'的问题，需要将数据特征分布或大语言模型的内部表示引导至能够保证群体公平结果的理想分布。现有公平生成模型和表示引导方法缺乏对模型输出的可证明公平性保证。

Method: 定义理想分布为任何成本敏感风险最小化器都能保证精确群体公平结果的分布。提出基于KL散度的最优引导优化程序，找到最近的理想分布，并为常见参数分布族（如正态、对数正态）提供高效算法。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的实验表明，最优引导技术在不降低效用的情况下改善了公平性（有时甚至提高了效用）。在Bios数据集上的多类分类任务中，通过仿射引导LLM表示减少了偏见。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效引导LLM内部表示以实现跨群体的公平性能，为解决公平机器学习中的偏见问题提供了理论保证和实用工具。

Abstract: To fix the 'bias in, bias out' problem in fair machine learning, it is
important to steer feature distributions of data or internal representations of
Large Language Models (LLMs) to ideal ones that guarantee group-fair outcomes.
Previous work on fair generative models and representation steering could
greatly benefit from provable fairness guarantees on the model output. We
define a distribution as ideal if the minimizer of any cost-sensitive risk on
it is guaranteed to have exact group-fair outcomes (e.g., demographic parity,
equal opportunity)-in other words, it has no fairness-utility trade-off. We
formulate an optimization program for optimal steering by finding the nearest
ideal distribution in KL-divergence, and provide efficient algorithms for it
when the underlying distributions come from well-known parametric families
(e.g., normal, log-normal). Empirically, our optimal steering techniques on
both synthetic and real-world datasets improve fairness without diminishing
utility (and sometimes even improve utility). We demonstrate affine steering of
LLM representations to reduce bias in multi-class classification, e.g.,
occupation prediction from a short biography in Bios dataset (De-Arteaga et
al.). Furthermore, we steer internal representations of LLMs towards desired
outputs so that it works equally well across different groups.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于神经网络和深度强化学习的半导体制造产能规划模型，使用异构图神经网络表示策略，能够主动决策并提高吞吐量、减少周期时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前半导体制造业通常使用启发式规则进行产能规划，虽然具有可解释性，但难以处理工艺流中复杂的相互作用，容易导致瓶颈形成。需要更智能的方法来优化资源配置。

Method: 采用深度强化学习训练神经网络模型，使用异构图神经网络表示策略，直接捕捉机器和处理步骤之间的多样化关系，实现主动决策。采取了多种措施确保模型的可扩展性。

Result: 在Intel的小规模Minifab模型和SMT2020测试平台上进行评估，在最大测试场景中，训练后的策略使吞吐量提高约1.8%，周期时间减少约1.8%。

Conclusion: 基于深度强化学习的图神经网络方法能够有效解决半导体制造中的产能规划问题，相比传统启发式方法具有更好的性能表现。

Abstract: In manufacturing, capacity planning is the process of allocating production
resources in accordance with variable demand. The current industry practice in
semiconductor manufacturing typically applies heuristic rules to prioritize
actions, such as future change lists that account for incoming machine and
recipe dedications. However, while offering interpretability, heuristics cannot
easily account for the complex interactions along the process flow that can
gradually lead to the formation of bottlenecks. Here, we present a neural
network-based model for capacity planning on the level of individual machines,
trained using deep reinforcement learning. By representing the policy using a
heterogeneous graph neural network, the model directly captures the diverse
relationships among machines and processing steps, allowing for proactive
decision-making. We describe several measures taken to achieve sufficient
scalability to tackle the vast space of possible machine-level actions.
  Our evaluation results cover Intel's small-scale Minifab model and
preliminary experiments using the popular SMT2020 testbed. In the largest
tested scenario, our trained policy increases throughput and decreases cycle
time by about 1.8% each.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Lookahead优化器通过双权重更新机制提升了深度学习模型性能，但现有理论研究主要关注训练数据上的收敛性，对其泛化能力理解不足，且现有分析受限于限制性假设。

Method: 利用平均模型稳定性方法，对使用小批量SGD的Lookahead优化器进行分析，推导泛化界。

Result: 分析表明在凸设置下，泛化性能随批量大小呈线性加速。

Conclusion: 本文为Lookahead优化器提供了更严格的泛化理论分析框架，消除了现有研究的限制性假设，揭示了优化与泛化之间的更完整关系。

Abstract: The Lookahead optimizer enhances deep learning models by employing a
dual-weight update mechanism, which has been shown to improve the performance
of underlying optimizers such as SGD. However, most theoretical studies focus
on its convergence on training data, leaving its generalization capabilities
less understood. Existing generalization analyses are often limited by
restrictive assumptions, such as requiring the loss function to be globally
Lipschitz continuous, and their bounds do not fully capture the relationship
between optimization and generalization. In this paper, we address these issues
by conducting a rigorous stability and generalization analysis of the Lookahead
optimizer with minibatch SGD. We leverage on-average model stability to derive
generalization bounds for both convex and strongly convex problems without the
restrictive Lipschitzness assumption. Our analysis demonstrates a linear
speedup with respect to the batch size in the convex setting.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于自回归语言模型和蒙特卡洛树搜索的方法在处理长程依赖时效果不佳，且搜索空间过大导致效率低下。需要一种能够联合修订多个位置并高效探索大序列空间的方法。

Method: MCTD-ME整合掩码扩散模型与树搜索，使用生物物理保真度增强的扩散去噪作为展开引擎，通过pLDDT掩码调度和PH-UCT-ME多专家选择规则，实现多令牌规划和高效探索。

Result: 在CAMEO和PDB基准测试中，MCTD-ME在序列恢复率(AAR)和结构相似性(scTM)方面优于单专家和无指导基线，对长蛋白质效果更明显，多专家指导带来额外收益。

Conclusion: MCTD-ME框架具有模型无关性，不仅适用于逆折叠任务，还可扩展到从头蛋白质工程和多目标分子生成等更广泛的应用场景。

Abstract: The goal of protein design is to generate amino acid sequences that fold into
functional structures with desired properties. Prior methods combining
autoregressive language models with Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) struggle
with long-range dependencies and suffer from an impractically large search
space. We propose MCTD-ME, Monte Carlo Tree Diffusion with Multiple Experts,
which integrates masked diffusion models with tree search to enable multi-token
planning and efficient exploration. Unlike autoregressive planners, MCTD-ME
uses biophysical-fidelity-enhanced diffusion denoising as the rollout engine,
jointly revising multiple positions and scaling to large sequence spaces. It
further leverages experts of varying capacities to enrich exploration, guided
by a pLDDT-based masking schedule that targets low-confidence regions while
preserving reliable residues. We propose a novel multi-expert selection rule
(PH-UCT-ME) extends predictive-entropy UCT to expert ensembles. On the inverse
folding task (CAMEO and PDB benchmarks), MCTD-ME outperforms single-expert and
unguided baselines in both sequence recovery (AAR) and structural similarity
(scTM), with gains increasing for longer proteins and benefiting from
multi-expert guidance. More generally, the framework is model-agnostic and
applicable beyond inverse folding, including de novo protein engineering and
multi-objective molecular generation.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为LSRE的实例生成方法，用于为元黑盒优化（MetaBBO）生成多样化的训练问题实例，以解决现有CoCo-BBOB基准套件多样性不足导致的过拟合问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的MetaBBO方法使用CoCo-BBOB基准套件作为训练集，但该套件中的问题实例多样性有限，容易导致MetaBBO过拟合和泛化性能差。

Method: LSRE方法首先训练一个自编码器将高维问题特征映射到2维潜空间，通过在该空间进行均匀网格采样获得多样化的隐藏表示，然后使用遗传编程方法搜索与这些表示具有最小L2距离的函数公式，从而逆向工程生成多样化的问题集Diverse-BBO。

Result: 实验结果表明，在Diverse-BBO上训练的各种MetaBBO在合成和现实场景中都表现出更好的泛化性能，优于现有的训练集选择。

Conclusion: LSRE方法有效解决了MetaBBO训练集多样性不足的问题，消融研究不仅验证了LSRE设计选择的有效性，还揭示了实例多样性与MetaBBO泛化性能之间的有趣关系。

Abstract: To relieve intensive human-expertise required to design optimization
algorithms, recent Meta-Black-Box Optimization (MetaBBO) researches leverage
generalization strength of meta-learning to train neural network-based
algorithm design policies over a predefined training problem set, which
automates the adaptability of the low-level optimizers on unseen problem
instances. Currently, a common training problem set choice in existing MetaBBOs
is well-known benchmark suites CoCo-BBOB. Although such choice facilitates the
MetaBBO's development, problem instances in CoCo-BBOB are more or less limited
in diversity, raising the risk of overfitting of MetaBBOs, which might further
results in poor generalization. In this paper, we propose an instance
generation approach, termed as \textbf{LSRE}, which could generate diverse
training problem instances for MetaBBOs to learn more generalizable policies.
LSRE first trains an autoencoder which maps high-dimensional problem features
into a 2-dimensional latent space. Uniform-grid sampling in this latent space
leads to hidden representations of problem instances with sufficient diversity.
By leveraging a genetic-programming approach to search function formulas with
minimal L2-distance to these hidden representations, LSRE reverse engineers a
diversified problem set, termed as \textbf{Diverse-BBO}. We validate the
effectiveness of LSRE by training various MetaBBOs on Diverse-BBO and observe
their generalization performances on either synthetic or realistic scenarios.
Extensive experimental results underscore the superiority of Diverse-BBO to
existing training set choices in MetaBBOs. Further ablation studies not only
demonstrate the effectiveness of design choices in LSRE, but also reveal
interesting insights on instance diversity and MetaBBO's generalization.

TL;DR: ThermalGuardian是一种针对温度变化环境下汽车深度学习框架的测试方法，通过模型变异规则生成测试输入模型，模拟GPU温度波动，并基于实时GPU温度控制GPU频率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 汽车深度学习框架在部署时面临极端环境温度变化（-40°C至50°C），这会导致GPU频率动态调整，进而引发计算密集型算子延迟或错误、高/混合精度算子精度错误以及时间序列算子同步问题。现有测试方法未考虑温度对框架质量的影响。

Method: ThermalGuardian采用模型变异规则生成针对温度敏感算子的测试输入模型，基于牛顿冷却定律模拟GPU温度波动，并根据实时GPU温度控制GPU频率。

Result: 该方法能够检测温度变化导致的深度学习框架质量问题，包括算子延迟、精度错误和同步问题。

Conclusion: ThermalGuardian是首个针对温度变化环境下汽车深度学习框架的测试方法，有效填补了现有测试方法在温度影响方面的空白。

Abstract: Deep learning models play a vital role in autonomous driving systems,
supporting critical functions such as environmental perception. To accelerate
model inference, these deep learning models' deployment relies on automotive
deep learning frameworks, for example, PaddleInference in Apollo and TensorRT
in AutoWare. However, unlike deploying deep learning models on the cloud,
vehicular environments experience extreme ambient temperatures varying from
-40{\deg}C to 50{\deg}C, significantly impacting GPU temperature. Additionally,
heats generated when computing further lead to the GPU temperature increase.
These temperature fluctuations lead to dynamic GPU frequency adjustments
through mechanisms such as DVFS. However, automotive deep learning frameworks
are designed without considering the impact of temperature-induced frequency
variations. When deployed on temperature-varying GPUs, these frameworks suffer
critical quality issues: compute-intensive operators face delays or errors,
high/mixed-precision operators suffer from precision errors, and time-series
operators suffer from synchronization issues. The above quality issues cannot
be detected by existing deep learning framework testing methods because they
ignore temperature's effect on the deep learning framework quality. To bridge
this gap, we propose ThermalGuardian, the first automotive deep learning
framework testing method under temperature-varying environments. Specifically,
ThermalGuardian generates test input models using model mutation rules
targeting temperature-sensitive operators, simulates GPU temperature
fluctuations based on Newton's law of cooling, and controls GPU frequency based
on real-time GPU temperature.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Muon优化器在处理神经网络矩阵结构参数方面表现出色，但其理论理解与实际性能之间存在显著差距。现有分析表明标准Muon变体在随机非凸设置下只能达到次优收敛率。

Method: 构建并分析了一个方差缩减变体Muon-VR2，通过引入方差缩减机制来提升收敛性能。

Result: Muon-VR2达到了最优收敛率$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(T^{-1/3})$，匹配了该类问题的理论下界。在CIFAR-10和C4基准测试上的实验验证了理论发现。

Conclusion: 这项工作首次证明了Muon风格优化器的最优性，为开发更实用的加速变体指明了方向。

Abstract: The Muon optimizer has demonstrated remarkable empirical success in handling
matrix-structured parameters for training neural networks. However, a
significant gap persists between its practical performance and theoretical
understanding. Existing analyses indicate that the standard Muon variant
achieves only a suboptimal convergence rate of $\mathcal{O}(T^{-1/4})$ in
stochastic non-convex settings, where $T$ denotes the number of iterations. To
explore the theoretical limits of the Muon framework, we construct and analyze
a variance-reduced variant, termed Muon-VR2. We provide the first rigorous
proof that incorporating a variance-reduction mechanism enables Muon-VR2 to
attain an optimal convergence rate of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(T^{-1/3})$, thereby
matching the theoretical lower bound for this class of problems. Moreover, our
analysis establishes convergence guarantees for Muon variants under the
Polyak-{\L}ojasiewicz (P{\L}) condition. Extensive experiments on vision
(CIFAR-10) and language (C4) benchmarks corroborate our theoretical findings on
per-iteration convergence. Overall, this work provides the first proof of
optimality for a Muon-style optimizer and clarifies the path toward developing
more practically efficient, accelerated variants.

Motivation: 当前太阳辐照度预测解决方案缺乏系统运营商所需的时空分辨率，而准确的日前预测对于大规模光伏系统并网至关重要。

Method: 使用新颖的图神经网络结合卫星图像和地面气象站时间序列数据，能够生成概率预测，无需重新训练即可整合新数据，仅通过坐标即可为无输入数据的位置生成预测。

Result: 在瑞士127个地点的一年数据集上测试，预测范围内的归一化平均绝对误差为6.1%，结果与商业数值天气预报服务具有竞争力。

Conclusion: SolarCrossFormer在真实运行中表现出鲁棒性，能够为瑞士任何位置提供15分钟分辨率、24小时预测范围内的概率预测，且性能与商业服务相当。

Abstract: Accurate day-ahead forecasts of solar irradiance are required for the
large-scale integration of solar photovoltaic (PV) systems into the power grid.
However, current forecasting solutions lack the temporal and spatial resolution
required by system operators. In this paper, we introduce SolarCrossFormer, a
novel deep learning model for day-ahead irradiance forecasting, that combines
satellite images and time series from a ground-based network of meteorological
stations. SolarCrossFormer uses novel graph neural networks to exploit the
inter- and intra-modal correlations of the input data and improve the accuracy
and resolution of the forecasts. It generates probabilistic forecasts for any
location in Switzerland with a 15-minute resolution for horizons up to 24 hours
ahead. One of the key advantages of SolarCrossFormer its robustness in real
life operations. It can incorporate new time-series data without retraining the
model and, additionally, it can produce forecasts for locations without input
data by using only their coordinates. Experimental results over a dataset of
one year and 127 locations across Switzerland show that SolarCrossFormer yield
a normalized mean absolute error of 6.1 % over the forecasting horizon. The
results are competitive with those achieved by a commercial numerical weather
prediction service.

Result: 实验表明HyP-ASO在大规模整数线性规划问题上显著优于现有基于大邻域搜索的方法。

Conclusion: HyP-ASO是轻量级且高度可扩展的框架，非常适合解决大规模整数线性规划问题。

Abstract: Directly solving large-scale Integer Linear Programs (ILPs) using traditional
solvers is slow due to their NP-hard nature. While recent frameworks based on
Large Neighborhood Search (LNS) can accelerate the solving process, their
performance is often constrained by the difficulty in generating sufficiently
effective neighborhoods. To address this challenge, we propose HyP-ASO, a
hybrid policy-based adaptive search optimization framework that combines a
customized formula with deep Reinforcement Learning (RL). The formula leverages
feasible solutions to calculate the selection probabilities for each variable
in the neighborhood generation process, and the RL policy network predicts the
neighborhood size. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HyP-ASO significantly
outperforms existing LNS-based approaches for large-scale ILPs. Additional
experiments show it is lightweight and highly scalable, making it well-suited
for solving large-scale ILPs.

Abstract: Dynamic GNNs, which integrate temporal and spatial features in
Electroencephalography (EEG) data, have shown great potential in automating
seizure detection. However, fully capturing the underlying dynamics necessary
to represent brain states, such as seizure and non-seizure, remains a
non-trivial task and presents two fundamental challenges. First, most existing
dynamic GNN methods are built on temporally fixed static graphs, which fail to
reflect the evolving nature of brain connectivity during seizure progression.
Second, current efforts to jointly model temporal signals and graph structures
and, more importantly, their interactions remain nascent, often resulting in
inconsistent performance. To address these challenges, we present the first
theoretical analysis of these two problems, demonstrating the effectiveness and
necessity of explicit dynamic modeling and time-then-graph dynamic GNN method.
Building on these insights, we propose EvoBrain, a novel seizure detection
model that integrates a two-stream Mamba architecture with a GCN enhanced by
Laplacian Positional Encoding, following neurological insights. Moreover,
EvoBrain incorporates explicitly dynamic graph structures, allowing both nodes
and edges to evolve over time. Our contributions include (a) a theoretical
analysis proving the expressivity advantage of explicit dynamic modeling and
time-then-graph over other approaches, (b) a novel and efficient model that
significantly improves AUROC by 23% and F1 score by 30%, compared with the
dynamic GNN baseline, and (c) broad evaluations of our method on the
challenging early seizure prediction tasks.

Abstract: In the realm of distributed AI and privacy-focused medical applications, we
propose a framework for multi-view clustering that links quantum field theory
with federated healthcare analytics. Our method uses heat-kernel coefficients
from spectral analysis to convert Euclidean distances into geometry-aware
similarity measures, capturing the structure of diverse medical data. We lay
this out through the Heat Kernel Distance (HKD) transformation with convergence
guarantees. Two algorithms are developed: Heat Kernel-Enhanced Multi-View Fuzzy
Clustering (HK-MVFC) for central analysis, and Federated Heat Kernel Multi-View
Fuzzy Clustering (FedHK-MVFC) for secure, privacy-preserving learning across
hospitals using differential privacy and secure aggregation to facilitate
HIPAA-compliant collaboration. Tests on synthetic datasets of cardiovascular
patients show an $8-12 \%$ increase in clustering accuracy, $70 \%$ reduced
communication, and $98.2 \%$ efficiency retention over centralized methods.
Validated on 10,000 patient records across two hospitals, it proves useful for
collaborative phenotyping involving ECG, cardiac imaging, and behavioral data.
Our theoretical contributions include update rules with proven convergence,
adaptive view weighting, and privacy-preserving protocols. This presents a new
standard for geometry-aware federated learning in healthcare, turning advanced
math into workable solutions for analyzing sensitive medical data while
ensuring both rigor and clinical relevance.

Abstract: Imbalanced classification datasets pose significant challenges in machine
learning, often leading to biased models that perform poorly on
underrepresented classes. With the rise of foundation models, recent research
has focused on the full, partial, and parameter-efficient fine-tuning of these
models to deal with long-tail classification. Despite the impressive
performance of these works on the benchmark datasets, they still fail to close
the gap with the networks trained using the balanced datasets and still require
substantial computational resources, even for relatively smaller datasets.
Underscoring the importance of computational efficiency and simplicity, in this
work we propose a novel framework that leverages the rich semantic latent space
of Vision Foundation Models to generate synthetic data and train a simple
linear classifier using a mixture of real and synthetic data for long-tail
classification. The computational efficiency gain arises from the number of
trainable parameters that are reduced to just the number of parameters in the
linear model. Our method sets a new state-of-the-art for the CIFAR-100-LT
benchmark and demonstrates strong performance on the Places-LT benchmark,
highlighting the effectiveness and adaptability of our simple and effective
approach.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个公开可用的白血病骨髓数据集，覆盖从细胞检测到诊断的完整流程，并开发了相应的AI模型，在细胞检测、分类和诊断预测方面取得了良好效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前白血病诊断主要依赖人工显微镜分析，过程复杂耗时。现有AI解决方案大多使用私有数据集且仅覆盖部分诊断流程，缺乏全面公开的数据集。

Method: 构建了包含246名儿科患者的大规模高质量数据集，包含诊断、临床和实验室信息，超过40,000个带边界框标注的细胞。基于此数据集开发了细胞检测、细胞分类和诊断预测的AI方法。

Result: 细胞检测平均精度0.96，33类细胞分类的AUC为0.98、F1分数0.61，使用预测细胞计数的诊断预测平均F1分数为0.90。

Conclusion: 提出的方法证明了AI辅助诊断的有效性，该数据集将促进该领域的进一步研究发展，有助于提高诊断精度和改善患者预后。

Abstract: Leukemia diagnosis primarily relies on manual microscopic analysis of bone
marrow morphology supported by additional laboratory parameters, making it
complex and time consuming. While artificial intelligence (AI) solutions have
been proposed, most utilize private datasets and only cover parts of the
diagnostic pipeline. Therefore, we present a large, high-quality, publicly
available leukemia bone marrow dataset spanning the entire diagnostic process,
from cell detection to diagnosis. Using this dataset, we further propose
methods for cell detection, cell classification, and diagnosis prediction. The
dataset comprises 246 pediatric patients with diagnostic, clinical and
laboratory information, over 40 000 cells with bounding box annotations and
more than 28 000 of these with high-quality class labels, making it the most
comprehensive dataset publicly available. Evaluation of the AI models yielded
an average precision of 0.96 for the cell detection, an area under the curve of
0.98, and an F1-score of 0.61 for the 33-class cell classification, and a mean
F1-score of 0.90 for the diagnosis prediction using predicted cell counts.
While the proposed approaches demonstrate their usefulness for AI-assisted
diagnostics, the dataset will foster further research and development in the
field, ultimately contributing to more precise diagnoses and improved patient
outcomes.

*Van-Tuan Tran,Hong-Hanh Nguyen-Le,Quoc-Viet Pham*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为ToFU的联邦遗忘学习框架，通过在训练过程中引入变换来减少神经网络对特定实例的记忆，从而简化后续的遗忘过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的联邦遗忘方法主要在事后进行，难以有效擦除神经网络深度记忆的信息。需要设计一种天生易于遗忘的联邦学习系统。

Method: 提出了基于变换引导的联邦遗忘框架(ToFU)，在训练过程中引入变换来限制实例特定信息的记忆，理论分析表明变换组合可以概率地限制实例信息。

Result: 在CIFAR-10、CIFAR-100和MUFAC基准测试中，ToFU优于现有基线方法，与现有方法集成时能提升性能，并减少遗忘时间。

Conclusion: ToFU框架为联邦遗忘提供了新的范式，通过在学习过程中主动减少记忆，实现了更有效的隐私保护。

Abstract: Neural networks unintentionally memorize training data, creating privacy
risks in federated learning (FL) systems, such as inference and reconstruction
attacks on sensitive data. To mitigate these risks and to comply with privacy
regulations, Federated Unlearning (FU) has been introduced to enable
participants in FL systems to remove their data's influence from the global
model. However, current FU methods primarily act post-hoc, struggling to
efficiently erase information deeply memorized by neural networks. We argue
that effective unlearning necessitates a paradigm shift: designing FL systems
inherently amenable to forgetting. To this end, we propose a
learning-to-unlearn Transformation-guided Federated Unlearning (ToFU) framework
that incorporates transformations during the learning process to reduce
memorization of specific instances. Our theoretical analysis reveals how
transformation composition provably bounds instance-specific information,
directly simplifying subsequent unlearning. Crucially, ToFU can work as a
plug-and-play framework that improves the performance of existing FU methods.
Experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and the MUFAC benchmark show that ToFU
outperforms existing FU baselines, enhances performance when integrated with
current methods, and reduces unlearning time.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文探讨了如何将基础模型（FMs）整合到强化学习框架中以提高样本效率，评估了基础世界模型（FWMs）和基础智能体（FAs）两种策略在不同网格世界环境中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界应用中昂贵的交互成本要求更高效的样本利用，而基础模型具有广泛的知识和推理能力，但如何有效将其整合到强化学习框架中尚不明确。

Method: 通过实验评估两种策略：1）使用基础世界模型（FWMs）利用FMs的先验知识进行模拟交互训练；2）使用基础智能体（FAs）利用FMs的推理能力进行决策制定。在适合当前大语言模型的网格世界环境中进行实证研究。

Result: 结果表明：LLMs的改进直接提升了FWMs和FAs的性能；基于当前LLMs的FAs在简单环境中已能提供优秀策略；FWMs与强化学习智能体的结合在具有部分可观测性和随机性的复杂环境中表现优异。

Conclusion: 基础模型在提升强化学习样本效率方面具有巨大潜力，特别是FWMs与强化学习的结合为复杂环境下的决策问题提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: While reinforcement learning from scratch has shown impressive results in
solving sequential decision-making tasks with efficient simulators, real-world
applications with expensive interactions require more sample-efficient agents.
Foundation models (FMs) are natural candidates to improve sample efficiency as
they possess broad knowledge and reasoning capabilities, but it is yet unclear
how to effectively integrate them into the reinforcement learning framework. In
this paper, we anticipate and, most importantly, evaluate two promising
strategies. First, we consider the use of foundation world models (FWMs) that
exploit the prior knowledge of FMs to enable training and evaluating agents
with simulated interactions. Second, we consider the use of foundation agents
(FAs) that exploit the reasoning capabilities of FMs for decision-making. We
evaluate both approaches empirically in a family of grid-world environments
that are suitable for the current generation of large language models (LLMs).
Our results suggest that improvements in LLMs already translate into better
FWMs and FAs; that FAs based on current LLMs can already provide excellent
policies for sufficiently simple environments; and that the coupling of FWMs
and reinforcement learning agents is highly promising for more complex settings
with partial observability and stochastic elements.

TL;DR: SAGE是一个语义感知的共享采样框架，通过共享相似查询的早期采样阶段来减少扩散模型的采样成本，同时保持生成质量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在多个领域表现出明显优势，但其高采样成本（需要数十次顺序模型评估）仍然是一个主要限制。现有方法主要通过优化求解器或蒸馏来加速采样，但每个查询都是独立处理的

Method: 提出SAGE框架，通过共享语义相似查询的早期采样阶段来减少总步数，结合共享采样方案和定制训练策略，在保证效率的同时不牺牲质量

Result: 实验表明SAGE将采样成本降低25.5%，同时提高生成质量：FID降低5.0%，CLIP得分提高5.4%，多样性提高160%

Conclusion: SAGE通过语义感知的共享采样机制，有效解决了扩散模型采样成本高的问题，在保持质量的同时显著提升了效率

Abstract: Diffusion models manifest evident benefits across diverse domains, yet their
high sampling cost, requiring dozens of sequential model evaluations, remains a
major limitation. Prior efforts mainly accelerate sampling via optimized
solvers or distillation, which treat each query independently. In contrast, we
reduce total number of steps by sharing early-stage sampling across
semantically similar queries. To enable such efficiency gains without
sacrificing quality, we propose SAGE, a semantic-aware shared sampling
framework that integrates a shared sampling scheme for efficiency and a
tailored training strategy for quality preservation. Extensive experiments show
that SAGE reduces sampling cost by 25.5%, while improving generation quality
with 5.0% lower FID, 5.4% higher CLIP, and 160% higher diversity over
baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于扩散模型的AI生成竞价方法虽然优于传统离线强化学习方法，但仍面临性能瓶颈，主要原因是忽视了细粒度生成质量评估且无法超越静态数据集进行探索。

Method: AIGB-Pearl构建非自举的轨迹评估器来分配奖励并指导策略搜索，使规划器能够通过交互迭代优化生成质量。采用LLM架构增强表示能力，混合点对和配对损失改进评分学习，自适应整合专家反馈提升泛化能力。

Result: 在模拟和真实广告系统上的大量实验表明，该方法达到了最先进的性能水平。

Conclusion: AIGB-Pearl通过集成生成规划和策略优化，有效解决了现有方法的局限性，在自动竞价任务中表现出卓越性能。

Abstract: Auto-bidding is an essential tool for advertisers to enhance their
advertising performance. Recent progress has shown that AI-Generated Bidding
(AIGB), which formulates the auto-bidding as a trajectory generation task and
trains a conditional diffusion-based planner on offline data, achieves superior
and stable performance compared to typical offline reinforcement learning
(RL)-based auto-bidding methods. However, existing AIGB methods still encounter
a performance bottleneck due to their neglect of fine-grained generation
quality evaluation and inability to explore beyond static datasets. To address
this, we propose AIGB-Pearl (\emph{Planning with EvAluator via RL}), a novel
method that integrates generative planning and policy optimization. The key to
AIGB-Pearl is to construct a non-bootstrapped \emph{trajectory evaluator} to
assign rewards and guide policy search, enabling the planner to optimize its
generation quality iteratively through interaction. Furthermore, to enhance
trajectory evaluator accuracy in offline settings, we incorporate three key
techniques: (i) a Large Language Model (LLM)-based architecture for better
representational capacity, (ii) hybrid point-wise and pair-wise losses for
better score learning, and (iii) adaptive integration of expert feedback for
better generalization ability. Extensive experiments on both simulated and
real-world advertising systems demonstrate the state-of-the-art performance of
our approach.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文基于有限理性理论，将语言模型对齐视为资源受限的认知过程，提出了容量耦合的对齐性能区间理论框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于反馈的对齐方法存在系统性偏差，作者从经济学和认知科学的有限理性视角出发，将判断视为资源受限的过程，反馈作为受限信道。

Method: 建立两阶段级联模型U→H→Y|S，引入认知容量C_cog|S和总容量C_tot|S概念，结合Fano下界和PAC-Bayes上界构建对齐性能区间。

Result: 推导出容量耦合的对齐性能区间，表明在固定价值复杂度和容量时，仅增加标签无法突破性能界限；处理更复杂目标需要容量随logM增长；容量饱和后优化会拟合信道规律。

Conclusion: 将对齐视为接口工程：测量和分配有限容量、管理任务复杂性、决定信息使用位置，为理解对齐偏差提供了理论框架。

Abstract: Large language models improve with scale, yet feedback-based alignment still
exhibits systematic deviations from intended behavior. Motivated by bounded
rationality in economics and cognitive science, we view judgment as
resource-limited and feedback as a constrained channel. On this basis, we model
the loop as a two-stage cascade $U \to H \to Y$ given $S$, with cognitive
capacity $C_{\text{cog}|S}$ and average total capacity
$\bar{C}_{\text{tot}|S}$. Our main result is a capacity-coupled Alignment
Performance Interval. It pairs a data size-independent Fano lower bound proved
on a separable codebook mixture with a PAC-Bayes upper bound whose KL term is
controlled by the same channel via $m \, \bar{C}_{\text{tot}|S}$. The PAC-Bayes
bound becomes an upper bound on the same true risk when the canonical
observable loss is used and the dataset is drawn from the same mixture. Under
these matched conditions, both limits are governed by a single capacity.
Consequences include that, with value complexity and capacity fixed, adding
labels alone cannot cross the bound; attaining lower risk on more complex
targets requires capacity that grows with $\log M$; and once useful signal
saturates capacity, further optimization tends to fit channel regularities,
consistent with reports of sycophancy and reward hacking. The analysis views
alignment as interface engineering: measure and allocate limited capacity,
manage task complexity, and decide where information is spent.

Motivation: 强化学习工作流的异构性和动态性导致现有系统硬件利用率低、训练速度慢，需要更灵活高效的系统设计来提升RL训练性能。

Method: 提出M2Flow设计范式，自动分解和重组RL工作流；开发RLinf系统，采用上下文切换、弹性流水线和基于性能分析的调度策略来实现M2Flow转换。

Result: 在推理RL和具身RL任务上的广泛评估显示，RLinf持续优于最先进系统，端到端训练吞吐量提升1.1倍到2.13倍。

Conclusion: RLinf通过创新的M2Flow设计范式有效解决了RL训练中的系统灵活性瓶颈，显著提升了训练效率和硬件利用率。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has demonstrated immense potential in advancing
artificial general intelligence, agentic intelligence, and embodied
intelligence. However, the inherent heterogeneity and dynamicity of RL
workflows often lead to low hardware utilization and slow training on existing
systems. In this paper, we present RLinf, a high-performance RL training system
based on our key observation that the major roadblock to efficient RL training
lies in system flexibility. To maximize flexibility and efficiency, RLinf is
built atop a novel RL system design paradigm called macro-to-micro flow
transformation (M2Flow), which automatically breaks down high-level,
easy-to-compose RL workflows at both the temporal and spatial dimensions, and
recomposes them into optimized execution flows. Supported by RLinf worker's
adaptive communication capability, we devise context switching and elastic
pipelining to realize M2Flow transformation, and a profiling-guided scheduling
policy to generate optimal execution plans. Extensive evaluations on both
reasoning RL and embodied RL tasks demonstrate that RLinf consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art systems, achieving 1.1x-2.13x speedup in
end-to-end training throughput.

Motivation: 传统的MCTS方法在符号回归中存在bandit策略和顺序符号构建的限制，影响了搜索性能。

Method: 采用极端bandit分配策略（具有有限时间性能保证）和进化启发的状态跳跃动作（如变异和交叉），实现非局部搜索空间转换。

Result: 在多种数据集上的实验表明，该方法在恢复率和准确性-模型复杂度Pareto前沿方面达到了与最先进方法竞争的性能。

Conclusion: 提出的改进MCTS框架有效解决了传统方法的局限性，在符号回归任务中表现出优越的性能。

Abstract: Symbolic regression aims to discover concise, interpretable mathematical
expressions that satisfy desired objectives, such as fitting data, posing a
highly combinatorial optimization problem. While genetic programming has been
the dominant approach, recent efforts have explored reinforcement learning
methods for improving search efficiency. Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), with
its ability to balance exploration and exploitation through guided search, has
emerged as a promising technique for symbolic expression discovery. However,
its traditional bandit strategies and sequential symbol construction often
limit performance. In this work, we propose an improved MCTS framework for
symbolic regression that addresses these limitations through two key
innovations: (1) an extreme bandit allocation strategy tailored for identifying
globally optimal expressions, with finite-time performance guarantees under
polynomial reward decay assumptions; and (2) evolution-inspired state-jumping
actions such as mutation and crossover, which enable non-local transitions to
promising regions of the search space. These state-jumping actions also reshape
the reward landscape during the search process, improving both robustness and
efficiency. We conduct a thorough numerical study to the impact of these
improvements and benchmark our approach against existing symbolic regression
methods on a variety of datasets, including both ground-truth and black-box
datasets. Our approach achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art
libraries in terms of recovery rate, attains favorable positions on the Pareto
frontier of accuracy versus model complexity. Code is available at

TL;DR: SPReD是一个强化学习框架，通过集成方法建模Q值分布，使用不确定性感知方法决定何时模仿示范动作而非遵循自身策略，实现连续而非二元的模仿决策。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在稀疏奖励的强化学习中，示范可以加速学习，但确定何时模仿示范仍具有挑战性。现有方法（如Q-filter）做出二元模仿决策，存在局限性。

Method: 使用集成方法显式建模示范动作和策略动作的Q值分布，开发两种不确定性感知方法：概率方法估计示范优越性的可能性，基于优势的方法按统计显著性缩放模仿比例。

Result: 在八个机器人任务实验中取得显著提升，在复杂任务中性能优于现有方法高达14倍，同时对示范质量和数量保持鲁棒性。

Conclusion: SPReD通过连续、不确定性比例的正则化权重减少训练中的梯度方差，计算简单但效果显著，为示范模仿提供了更精细的决策框架。

Abstract: In reinforcement learning with sparse rewards, demonstrations can accelerate
learning, but determining when to imitate them remains challenging. We propose
Smooth Policy Regularisation from Demonstrations (SPReD), a framework that
addresses the fundamental question: when should an agent imitate a
demonstration versus follow its own policy? SPReD uses ensemble methods to
explicitly model Q-value distributions for both demonstration and policy
actions, quantifying uncertainty for comparisons. We develop two complementary
uncertainty-aware methods: a probabilistic approach estimating the likelihood
of demonstration superiority, and an advantage-based approach scaling imitation
by statistical significance. Unlike prevailing methods (e.g. Q-filter) that
make binary imitation decisions, SPReD applies continuous,
uncertainty-proportional regularisation weights, reducing gradient variance
during training. Despite its computational simplicity, SPReD achieves
remarkable gains in experiments across eight robotics tasks, outperforming
existing approaches by up to a factor of 14 in complex tasks while maintaining
robustness to demonstration quality and quantity. Our code is available at

TL;DR: EmoHeal是一个端到端的个性化心理健康系统，通过检测27种细粒度情绪，结合音乐治疗原则生成三段式支持性叙事，显著改善用户情绪状态。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数字心理健康工具忽视日常挑战背后的细微情绪状态，如影响超过15亿人的睡前焦虑问题，当前方法过于静态且缺乏个性化适配。

Method: 使用微调的XLM-RoBERTa模型检测用户文本中的27种细粒度情绪，通过基于音乐治疗原则的知识图谱将情绪映射到音乐参数，采用CLAMP3模型检索视听内容，实施"匹配-引导-目标"三段式干预策略。

Result: 在40名参与者的组内研究中显示显著支持效果，参与者报告情绪显著改善(M=4.12, p<0.001)和高感知情绪识别准确率(M=4.05, p<0.001)，感知准确性与治疗效果强相关(r=0.72, p<0.001)。

Conclusion: 研究验证了理论驱动、情绪感知的数字健康工具的可行性，为规模化实施音乐治疗原则提供了可扩展的AI蓝图。

Abstract: Existing digital mental wellness tools often overlook the nuanced emotional
states underlying everyday challenges. For example, pre-sleep anxiety affects
more than 1.5 billion people worldwide, yet current approaches remain largely
static and "one-size-fits-all", failing to adapt to individual needs. In this
work, we present EmoHeal, an end-to-end system that delivers personalized,
three-stage supportive narratives. EmoHeal detects 27 fine-grained emotions
from user text with a fine-tuned XLM-RoBERTa model, mapping them to musical
parameters via a knowledge graph grounded in music therapy principles (GEMS,
iso-principle). EmoHeal retrieves audiovisual content using the CLAMP3 model to
guide users from their current state toward a calmer one
("match-guide-target"). A within-subjects study (N=40) demonstrated significant
supportive effects, with participants reporting substantial mood improvement
(M=4.12, p<0.001) and high perceived emotion recognition accuracy (M=4.05,
p<0.001). A strong correlation between perceived accuracy and therapeutic
outcome (r=0.72, p<0.001) validates our fine-grained approach. These findings
establish the viability of theory-driven, emotion-aware digital wellness tools
and provides a scalable AI blueprint for operationalizing music therapy
principles.

Motivation: 科学机器学习（SciML）在预测领域的应用有限，部分原因是难以结合偏微分方程（PDEs）来描述老化物理过程，以及缺乏稳健的不确定性量化方法。

Method: 开发了B-PINN框架，将贝叶斯神经网络嵌入物理信息神经网络架构中，使用热扩散PDE作为物理残差，并研究不同先验分布对预测后验分布的影响。

Abstract: Scientific Machine Learning (SciML) integrates physics and data into the
learning process, offering improved generalization compared with purely
data-driven models. Despite its potential, applications of SciML in prognostics
remain limited, partly due to the complexity of incorporating partial
differential equations (PDEs) for ageing physics and the scarcity of robust
uncertainty quantification methods. This work introduces a Bayesian
Physics-Informed Neural Network (B-PINN) framework for probabilistic
prognostics estimation. By embedding Bayesian Neural Networks into the PINN
architecture, the proposed approach produces principled, uncertainty-aware
predictions. The method is applied to a transformer ageing case study, where
insulation degradation is primarily driven by thermal stress. The heat
diffusion PDE is used as the physical residual, and different prior
distributions are investigated to examine their impact on predictive posterior
distributions and their ability to encode a priori physical knowledge. The
framework is validated against a finite element model developed and tested with
real measurements from a solar power plant. Results, benchmarked against a
dropout-PINN baseline, show that the proposed B-PINN delivers more reliable
prognostic predictions by accurately quantifying predictive uncertainty. This
capability is crucial for supporting robust and informed maintenance
decision-making in critical power assets.

Abstract: Accurate estimation of the in-hand pose of an object based on its CAD model
is crucial in both industrial applications and everyday tasks, ranging from
positioning workpieces and assembling components to seamlessly inserting
devices like USB connectors. While existing methods often rely on regression,
feature matching, or registration techniques, achieving high precision and
generalizability to unseen CAD models remains a significant challenge. In this
paper, we propose a novel three-stage framework for in-hand pose estimation.
The first stage involves sampling and pre-ranking pose candidates, followed by
iterative refinement of these candidates in the second stage. In the final
stage, post-ranking is applied to identify the most likely pose candidates.
These stages are governed by a unified energy-based diffusion model, which is
trained solely on simulated data. This energy model simultaneously generates
gradients to refine pose estimates and produces an energy scalar that
quantifies the quality of the pose estimates. Additionally, borrowing the idea
from the computer vision domain, we incorporate a render-compare architecture
within the energy-based score network to significantly enhance sim-to-real
performance, as demonstrated by our ablation studies. We conduct comprehensive
experiments to show that our method outperforms conventional baselines based on
regression, matching, and registration techniques, while also exhibiting strong
intra-category generalization to previously unseen CAD models. Moreover, our
approach integrates tactile object pose estimation, pose tracking, and
uncertainty estimation into a unified framework, enabling robust performance
across a variety of real-world conditions.

Abstract: Accurate atmospheric wind field information is crucial for various
applications, including weather forecasting, aviation safety, and disaster risk
reduction. However, obtaining high spatiotemporal resolution wind data remains
challenging due to limitations in traditional in-situ observations and remote
sensing techniques, as well as the computational expense and biases of
numerical weather prediction (NWP) models. This paper introduces G-WindCast, a
novel deep learning framework that leverages signal strength variations from 5G
Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) signals to retrieve and forecast
three-dimensional (3D) atmospheric wind fields. The framework utilizes Forward
Neural Networks (FNN) and Transformer networks to capture complex, nonlinear,
and spatiotemporal relationships between GNSS-derived features and wind
dynamics. Our preliminary results demonstrate promising accuracy in both wind
retrieval and short-term wind forecasting (up to 30 minutes lead time), with
skill scores comparable to high-resolution NWP outputs in certain scenarios.
The model exhibits robustness across different forecast horizons and pressure
levels, and its predictions for wind speed and direction show superior
agreement with observations compared to concurrent ERA5 reanalysis data.
Furthermore, we show that the system can maintain excellent performance for
localized forecasting even with a significantly reduced number of GNSS stations
(e.g., around 100), highlighting its cost-effectiveness and scalability. This
interdisciplinary approach underscores the transformative potential of
exploiting non-traditional data sources and deep learning for advanced
environmental monitoring and real-time atmospheric applications.

*Marko Tuononen,Heikki Penttinen,Ville Hautamäki*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文首次将影响函数应用于基于深度学习的无线接收器DeepRx，通过影响分析识别驱动比特预测的训练样本，实现针对性微调，相比随机微调能更有效降低误码率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索影响函数在深度学习无线接收器中的应用价值，旨在提高接收器的可解释性和自适应效率，解决特定场景下性能不佳的问题。

Method: 采用损失相对影响分析结合容量类二元交叉熵损失，对有益样本进行一阶更新；同时提出二阶影响对齐更新策略。

Result: 单目标场景下，该方法能显著改善误码率，接近理想性能，优于随机微调；但多目标适应效果较差。

Conclusion: 影响函数不仅可作为深度学习接收器的可解释性工具，还能为高效接收器自适应提供基础，尽管多目标适应仍面临挑战。

Abstract: We present the first use of influence functions for deep learning-based
wireless receivers. Applied to DeepRx, a fully convolutional receiver,
influence analysis reveals which training samples drive bit predictions,
enabling targeted fine-tuning of poorly performing cases. We show that
loss-relative influence with capacity-like binary cross-entropy loss and
first-order updates on beneficial samples most consistently improves bit error
rate toward genie-aided performance, outperforming random fine-tuning in
single-target scenarios. Multi-target adaptation proved less effective,
underscoring open challenges. Beyond experiments, we connect influence to
self-influence corrections and propose a second-order, influence-aligned update
strategy. Our results establish influence functions as both an interpretability
tool and a basis for efficient receiver adaptation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种名为AGF-TI的不完整多视图半监督学习方法，通过对抗图融合和低秩张量学习解决视图缺失导致的子簇问题，提高了分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视图缺失是图基多视图半监督学习中的主要挑战，传统方法忽视缺失样本导致的局部结构不连续问题（子簇问题），这会破坏标签传播的基本平滑性假设，影响图融合和分类性能。

Method: 设计对抗图融合方案通过min-max框架学习鲁棒共识图；使用低秩张量学习从高阶一致性信息中恢复不完整结构；结合锚点策略降低计算复杂度；开发结合降维梯度下降的高效交替优化算法。

Result: 在多个数据集上的广泛实验验证了AGF-TI相比现有最先进方法的优越性。

Conclusion: AGF-TI方法有效缓解了子簇问题，提高了不完整多视图半监督学习的性能，具有理论收敛保证和实际应用价值。

Abstract: View missing remains a significant challenge in graph-based multi-view
semi-supervised learning, hindering their real-world applications. To address
this issue, traditional methods introduce a missing indicator matrix and focus
on mining partial structure among existing samples in each view for label
propagation (LP). However, we argue that these disregarded missing samples
sometimes induce discontinuous local structures, i.e., sub-clusters, breaking
the fundamental smoothness assumption in LP. Consequently, such a Sub-Cluster
Problem (SCP) would distort graph fusion and degrade classification
performance. To alleviate SCP, we propose a novel incomplete multi-view
semi-supervised learning method, termed AGF-TI. Firstly, we design an
adversarial graph fusion scheme to learn a robust consensus graph against the
distorted local structure through a min-max framework. By stacking all
similarity matrices into a tensor, we further recover the incomplete structure
from the high-order consistency information based on the low-rank tensor
learning. Additionally, the anchor-based strategy is incorporated to reduce the
computational complexity. An efficient alternative optimization algorithm
combining a reduced gradient descent method is developed to solve the
formulated objective, with theoretical convergence. Extensive experimental
results on various datasets validate the superiority of our proposed AGF-TI as
compared to state-of-the-art methods. Code is available at

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DiffusionNFT是一种新的在线强化学习范式，通过流匹配直接在正向过程中优化扩散模型，避免了传统方法对求解器限制、前后向不一致等问题，效率比FlowGRPO提升25倍且无需分类器引导。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的在线强化学习在扩散模型中的应用面临挑战，包括求解器限制、前后向不一致性以及与分类器引导的复杂集成问题。

Method: DiffusionNFT通过流匹配在正向过程中优化扩散模型，对比正负生成来定义隐式策略改进方向，将强化信号自然融入监督学习目标。

Result: 在1k步内将GenEval分数从0.24提升到0.98，而FlowGRPO需要超过5k步和额外分类器引导才能达到0.95。使用多个奖励模型显著提升了SD3.5-Medium在所有基准测试中的性能。

Conclusion: DiffusionNFT提供了一个高效、灵活的扩散模型强化学习框架，消除了似然估计需求，仅需干净图像而非采样轨迹进行策略优化。

Abstract: Online reinforcement learning (RL) has been central to post-training language
models, but its extension to diffusion models remains challenging due to
intractable likelihoods. Recent works discretize the reverse sampling process
to enable GRPO-style training, yet they inherit fundamental drawbacks,
including solver restrictions, forward-reverse inconsistency, and complicated
integration with classifier-free guidance (CFG). We introduce Diffusion
Negative-aware FineTuning (DiffusionNFT), a new online RL paradigm that
optimizes diffusion models directly on the forward process via flow matching.
DiffusionNFT contrasts positive and negative generations to define an implicit
policy improvement direction, naturally incorporating reinforcement signals
into the supervised learning objective. This formulation enables training with
arbitrary black-box solvers, eliminates the need for likelihood estimation, and
requires only clean images rather than sampling trajectories for policy
optimization. DiffusionNFT is up to $25\times$ more efficient than FlowGRPO in
head-to-head comparisons, while being CFG-free. For instance, DiffusionNFT
improves the GenEval score from 0.24 to 0.98 within 1k steps, while FlowGRPO
achieves 0.95 with over 5k steps and additional CFG employment. By leveraging
multiple reward models, DiffusionNFT significantly boosts the performance of
SD3.5-Medium in every benchmark tested.

*Alan A. Lahoud,Erik Schaffernicht,Johannes A. Stork*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种逆优化潜变量模型（IO-LVM），用于学习约束优化问题（COPs）成本函数的潜空间表示，通过求解器在环中重建可行解，能够捕捉成本函数的分布而非单一函数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法如变分自编码器在解码结构化输出时难以强制执行约束，而标准逆优化方法通常只能恢复单一或上下文特定的成本函数，无法捕捉不同代理或条件下产生的多样化解行为。

Method: IO-LVM利用Fenchel-Young损失的估计梯度通过不可微确定性求解器来塑造潜空间，在训练过程中将求解器纳入循环，从观察到的解中学习COP成本函数的潜空间。

Result: 在真实世界的船舶和出租车路线数据集以及合成图中的路径上验证了该方法，展示了其重建路径和循环、预测其分布以及产生可解释潜表示的能力。

Conclusion: IO-LVM能够有效学习成本函数的分布，识别训练过程中不可用的不同代理或条件产生的多样化解行为，为约束优化问题的表示学习提供了新思路。

Abstract: Learning representations for solutions of constrained optimization problems
(COPs) with unknown cost functions is challenging, as models like (Variational)
Autoencoders struggle to enforce constraints when decoding structured outputs.
We propose an Inverse Optimization Latent Variable Model (IO-LVM) that learns a
latent space of COP cost functions from observed solutions and reconstructs
feasible outputs by solving a COP with a solver in the loop. Our approach
leverages estimated gradients of a Fenchel-Young loss through a
non-differentiable deterministic solver to shape the latent space. Unlike
standard Inverse Optimization or Inverse Reinforcement Learning methods, which
typically recover a single or context-specific cost function, IO-LVM captures a
distribution over cost functions, enabling the identification of diverse
solution behaviors arising from different agents or conditions not available
during the training process. We validate our method on real-world datasets of
ship and taxi routes, as well as paths in synthetic graphs, demonstrating its
ability to reconstruct paths and cycles, predict their distributions, and yield
interpretable latent representations.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的机器学习方法（如SympNets和HénonNets）需要固定步长的训练数据，无法处理不规则采样的测量数据。本文旨在学习时间自适应的辛积分器，特别是针对非自治哈密顿系统。

Method: 扩展TSympNets架构，使其适用于非自治哈密顿系统，并提供可分离哈密顿系统的通用逼近定理，同时修正了先前证明中的错误。

Result: 理论分析表明TSympNets可以逼近可分离哈密顿系统，但无法扩展到非可分离系统。数值实验验证了这些理论逼近能力。

Conclusion: TSympNets为处理不规则采样数据提供了有效方法，但存在对非可分离哈密顿系统的局限性，同时修正了相关理论证明中的错误。

Abstract: Measurement data is often sampled irregularly i.e. not on equidistant time
grids. This is also true for Hamiltonian systems. However, existing machine
learning methods, which learn symplectic integrators, such as SympNets [20] and
H\'enonNets [4] still require training data generated by fixed step sizes. To
learn time-adaptive symplectic integrators, an extension to SympNets, which we
call TSympNets, was introduced in [20]. We adapt the architecture of TSympNets
and extend them to non-autonomous Hamiltonian systems. So far the approximation
qualities of TSympNets were unknown. We close this gap by providing a universal
approximation theorem for separable Hamiltonian systems and show that it is not
possible to extend it to non-separable Hamiltonian systems. To investigate
these theoretical approximation capabilities, we perform different numerical
experiments. Furthermore we fix a mistake in a proof of a substantial theorem
[25, Theorem 2] for the approximation of symplectic maps in general, but
specifically for symplectic machine learning methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个完全自动化的本构模型发现框架，将三种稀疏回归算法（LASSO、LARS、OMP）与三种模型选择标准（K折交叉验证、AIC、BIC）系统配对，形成九种不同的算法组合。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统模型校准方法存在局限性，需要开发自动化的本构模型发现方法。本文旨在系统探索稀疏性、预测性能和计算成本之间的权衡。

Method: 使用LASSO、LARS和OMP三种稀疏回归算法，分别与K折交叉验证、AIC和BIC三种模型选择标准配对，形成九种算法组合。LARS用于解决ℓ1约束问题，OMP作为ℓ0正则化选择的启发式方法。

Result: 所有九种算法-标准组合在发现各向同性和各向异性材料本构模型方面表现一致良好，都能产生高精度的本构模型。

Conclusion: 该研究扩展了可行的发现算法范围，超越了基于ℓ1的方法如LASSO，为自动化本构模型发现提供了更广泛的选择。

Abstract: The automated discovery of constitutive models from data has recently emerged
as a promising alternative to the traditional model calibration paradigm. In
this work, we present a fully automated framework for constitutive model
discovery that systematically pairs three sparse regression algorithms (Least
Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO), Least Angle Regression
(LARS), and Orthogonal Matching Pursuit (OMP)) with three model selection
criteria: $K$-fold cross-validation (CV), Akaike Information Criterion (AIC),
and Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC). This pairing yields nine distinct
algorithms for model discovery and enables a systematic exploration of the
trade-off between sparsity, predictive performance, and computational cost.
While LARS serves as an efficient path-based solver for the
$\ell_1$-constrained problem, OMP is introduced as a tractable heuristic for
$\ell_0$-regularized selection. The framework is applied to both isotropic and
anisotropic hyperelasticity, utilizing both synthetic and experimental
datasets. Results reveal that all nine algorithm-criterion combinations perform
consistently well for the discovery of isotropic and anisotropic materials,
yielding highly accurate constitutive models. These findings broaden the range
of viable discovery algorithms beyond $\ell_1$-based approaches such as LASSO.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SABER是一种新的白盒越狱方法，通过在中间层添加残差连接来绕过LLM的安全对齐机制，在HarmBench测试集上比最佳基线提升51%性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLM经过安全对齐训练，但仍容易受到越狱攻击。研究发现LLM的安全机制主要嵌入在中后层，因此可以通过操纵这些层来绕过安全限制。

Method: SABER方法通过残差连接连接两个中间层s和e（s<e），直接绕过中后层的安全对齐机制，实现越狱攻击。

Result: 在HarmBench测试集上达到51%的性能提升，在验证集上仅引起轻微的困惑度变化。

Conclusion: SABER证明了LLM安全机制的脆弱性，为理解和改进LLM安全对齐提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) with safe-alignment training are powerful
instruments with robust language comprehension capabilities. These models
typically undergo meticulous alignment procedures involving human feedback to
ensure the acceptance of safe inputs while rejecting harmful or unsafe ones.
However, despite their massive scale and alignment efforts, LLMs remain
vulnerable to jailbreak attacks, where malicious users manipulate the model to
produce harmful outputs that it was explicitly trained to avoid. In this study,
we find that the safety mechanisms in LLMs are predominantly embedded in the
middle-to-late layers. Building on this insight, we introduce a novel white-box
jailbreak method, SABER (Safety Alignment Bypass via Extra Residuals), which
connects two intermediate layers $s$ and $e$ such that $s < e$, through a
residual connection. Our approach achieves a 51% improvement over the
best-performing baseline on the HarmBench test set. Furthermore, SABER induces
only a marginal shift in perplexity when evaluated on the HarmBench validation
set. The source code is publicly available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 无监督多元时间序列表示学习旨在从原始序列中提取紧凑且信息丰富的表示，无需依赖标签，以便高效迁移到各种下游任务。

Method: DMAE设计了两个互补的预训练任务：(1)基于可见属性重建掩码值，(2)在教师编码器指导下估计掩码特征的潜在表示，并引入特征级对齐约束来提升表示质量。

Result: 在分类、回归和预测任务上的综合评估表明，该方法相比竞争基线实现了持续且优越的性能。

Conclusion: 通过联合优化这些目标，DMAE能够学习到时间一致且语义丰富的表示。

Abstract: Unsupervised multivariate time series (MTS) representation learning aims to
extract compact and informative representations from raw sequences without
relying on labels, enabling efficient transfer to diverse downstream tasks. In
this paper, we propose Dual-Masked Autoencoder (DMAE), a novel masked
time-series modeling framework for unsupervised MTS representation learning.
DMAE formulates two complementary pretext tasks: (1) reconstructing masked
values based on visible attributes, and (2) estimating latent representations
of masked features, guided by a teacher encoder. To further improve
representation quality, we introduce a feature-level alignment constraint that
encourages the predicted latent representations to align with the teacher's
outputs. By jointly optimizing these objectives, DMAE learns temporally
coherent and semantically rich representations. Comprehensive evaluations
across classification, regression, and forecasting tasks demonstrate that our
approach achieves consistent and superior performance over competitive
baselines.

Conclusion: ReaSyn在组合巨大的可合成化学空间中具有卓越的导航能力，为解决分子可合成性问题提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: A well-known pitfall of molecular generative models is that they are not
guaranteed to generate synthesizable molecules. There have been considerable
attempts to address this problem, but given the exponentially large
combinatorial space of synthesizable molecules, existing methods have shown
limited coverage of the space and poor molecular optimization performance. To
tackle these problems, we introduce ReaSyn, a generative framework for
synthesizable projection where the model explores the neighborhood of given
molecules in the synthesizable space by generating pathways that result in
synthesizable analogs. To fully utilize the chemical knowledge contained in the
synthetic pathways, we propose a novel perspective that views synthetic
pathways akin to reasoning paths in large language models (LLMs). Specifically,
inspired by chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning in LLMs, we introduce the
chain-of-reaction (CoR) notation that explicitly states reactants, reaction
types, and intermediate products for each step in a pathway. With the CoR
notation, ReaSyn can get dense supervision in every reaction step to explicitly
learn chemical reaction rules during supervised training and perform
step-by-step reasoning. In addition, to further enhance the reasoning
capability of ReaSyn, we propose reinforcement learning (RL)-based finetuning
and goal-directed test-time compute scaling tailored for synthesizable
projection. ReaSyn achieves the highest reconstruction rate and pathway
diversity in synthesizable molecule reconstruction and the highest optimization
performance in synthesizable goal-directed molecular optimization, and
significantly outperforms previous synthesizable projection methods in
synthesizable hit expansion. These results highlight ReaSyn's superior ability
to navigate combinatorially-large synthesizable chemical space.

Conclusion: 该方法为生成模型提供了明确的鲁棒性认证框架，并在对抗性攻击测试中验证了有效性，为视觉语言模型的安全应用提供了理论保障。

Abstract: Randomized smoothing (RS) is one of the prominent techniques to ensure the
correctness of machine learning models, where point-wise robustness
certificates can be derived analytically. While RS is well understood for
classification, its application to generative models is unclear, since their
outputs are sequences rather than labels. We resolve this by connecting
generative outputs to an oracle classification task and showing that RS can
still be enabled: the final response can be classified as a discrete action
(e.g., service-robot commands in VLAs), as harmful vs. harmless (content
moderation or toxicity detection in VLMs), or even applying oracles to cluster
answers into semantically equivalent ones. Provided that the error rate for the
oracle classifier comparison is bounded, we develop the theory that associates
the number of samples with the corresponding robustness radius. We further
derive improved scaling laws analytically relating the certified radius and
accuracy to the number of samples, showing that the earlier result of 2 to 3
orders of magnitude fewer samples sufficing with minimal loss remains valid
even under weaker assumptions. Together, these advances make robustness
certification both well-defined and computationally feasible for
state-of-the-art VLMs, as validated against recent jailbreak-style adversarial
attacks.

Abstract: We present a robust personalized federated learning framework that leverages
heat-kernel enhanced tensorized multi-view fuzzy c-means clustering with
advanced tensor decomposition techniques. Our approach integrates heat-kernel
coefficients adapted from quantum field theory with Tucker decomposition and
canonical polyadic decomposition (CANDECOMP/PARAFAC) to transform conventional
distance metrics and efficiently represent high-dimensional multi-view
structures. The framework employs matriculation and vectorization techniques to
facilitate the discovery of hidden structures and multilinear relationships via
N-way generalized tensors. The proposed method introduces a dual-level
optimization scheme: local heat-kernel enhanced fuzzy clustering with tensor
decomposition operating on order-N input tensors, and federated aggregation of
tensor factors with privacy-preserving personalization mechanisms. The local
stage employs tensorized kernel Euclidean distance transformations and Tucker
decomposition to discover client-specific patterns in multi-view tensor data,
while the global aggregation process coordinates tensor factors (core tensors
and factor matrices) across clients through differential privacy-preserving
protocols. This tensorized approach enables efficient handling of
high-dimensional multi-view data with significant communication savings through
low-rank tensor approximations.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种动态CFG调度框架，通过在线反馈评估生成质量，为每个提示和样本定制独特的指导计划，显著提升文本对齐、视觉质量和文本渲染能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的静态指导尺度方法无法适应不同提示的多样化需求，而现有的梯度修正或固定启发式调度方案复杂且泛化能力差。

Method: 利用CLIP对齐、鉴别器保真度和人类偏好奖励模型等小规模潜空间评估的在线反馈，在反向扩散过程的每一步通过贪心搜索选择最优CFG尺度。

Result: 在Imagen 3等模型上实现了显著改进，相比基线获得高达53.8%的人类偏好胜率，在文本渲染等特定能力上达到55.5%。

Conclusion: 最优指导计划本质上是动态且依赖于提示的，本文提供了一个高效且可泛化的框架来实现这一目标。

Abstract: Classifier-free guidance (CFG) is a cornerstone of text-to-image diffusion
models, yet its effectiveness is limited by the use of static guidance scales.
This "one-size-fits-all" approach fails to adapt to the diverse requirements of
different prompts; moreover, prior solutions like gradient-based correction or
fixed heuristic schedules introduce additional complexities and fail to
generalize. In this work, we challeng this static paradigm by introducing a
framework for dynamic CFG scheduling. Our method leverages online feedback from
a suite of general-purpose and specialized small-scale latent-space
evaluations, such as CLIP for alignment, a discriminator for fidelity and a
human preference reward model, to assess generation quality at each step of the
reverse diffusion process. Based on this feedback, we perform a greedy search
to select the optimal CFG scale for each timestep, creating a unique guidance
schedule tailored to every prompt and sample. We demonstrate the effectiveness
of our approach on both small-scale models and the state-of-the-art Imagen 3,
showing significant improvements in text alignment, visual quality, text
rendering and numerical reasoning. Notably, when compared against the default
Imagen 3 baseline, our method achieves up to 53.8% human preference win-rate
for overall preference, a figure that increases up to to 55.5% on prompts
targeting specific capabilities like text rendering. Our work establishes that
the optimal guidance schedule is inherently dynamic and prompt-dependent, and
provides an efficient and generalizable framework to achieve it.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预测冲击波在多孔和结构材料中的传播对于行星防御、国家安全和惯性约束聚变能至关重要，但现有方法难以捕捉孔隙塌陷、异常Hugoniot响应和局部加热等关键现象。

Method: 引入多场时空深度学习模型（MSTM），将七个耦合场（压力、密度、温度、能量、材料分布和两个速度分量）统一到一个自回归代理模型中，基于高保真流体代码数据进行训练。

Result: MSTM运行速度比直接模拟快约1000倍，在多孔材料中误差低于4%，在晶格结构中误差低于10%，能够解析尖锐冲击波前，同时保持积分量（如质量平均压力和温度）误差在5%以内。

Conclusion: 该进展将原本难以处理的问题转化为可处理的设计研究，为优化中尺度结构材料在行星撞击缓解、惯性约束聚变能和国家安全中的应用建立了实用框架。

Abstract: The ability to predict how shock waves traverse porous and architected
materials is a decisive factor in planetary defense, national security, and the
race to achieve inertial fusion energy. Yet capturing pore collapse, anomalous
Hugoniot responses, and localized heating -- phenomena that can determine the
success of asteroid deflection or fusion ignition -- has remained a major
challenge despite recent advances in single-field and reduced representations.
We introduce a multi-field spatio-temporal deep learning model (MSTM) that
unifies seven coupled fields -- pressure, density, temperature, energy,
material distribution, and two velocity components -- into a single
autoregressive surrogate. Trained on high-fidelity hydrocode data, MSTM runs
about a thousand times faster than direct simulation, achieving errors below
4\% in porous materials and below 10\% in lattice structures. Unlike prior
single-field or operator-based surrogates, MSTM resolves sharp shock fronts
while preserving integrated quantities such as mass-averaged pressure and
temperature to within 5\%. This advance transforms problems once considered
intractable into tractable design studies, establishing a practical framework
for optimizing meso-structured materials in planetary impact mitigation,
inertial fusion energy, and national security.

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (RL) is emerging as a viable strategy for
automated cyber defense (ACD). The traditional RL approach represents networks
as a list of computers in various states of safety or threat. Unfortunately,
these models are forced to overfit to specific network topologies, rendering
them ineffective when faced with even small environmental perturbations. In
this work, we frame ACD as a two-player context-based partially observable
Markov decision problem with observations represented as attributed graphs.
This approach allows our agents to reason through the lens of relational
inductive bias. Agents learn how to reason about hosts interacting with other
system entities in a more general manner, and their actions are understood as
edits to the graph representing the environment. By introducing this bias, we
will show that our agents can better reason about the states of networks and
zero-shot adapt to new ones. We show that this approach outperforms the
state-of-the-art by a wide margin, and makes our agents capable of defending
never-before-seen networks against a wide range of adversaries in a variety of
complex, and multi-agent environments.

### [231] [DIVEBATCH: Accelerating Model Training Through Gradient-Diversity Aware Batch Size Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16173)
*Yuen Chen,Yian Wang,Hari Sundaram*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为DiveBatch的自适应批量大小SGD算法，通过动态调整批量大小来加速机器学习模型训练，在保持小批量训练泛化性能的同时提高收敛速度和计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模深度神经网络训练计算成本高昂，传统方法主要关注学习率调整，但批量大小对训练效率和泛化性能有重要影响。大批量可并行计算更高效，但小批量训练收敛更快且泛化更好。

Method: 基于梯度多样性的数据驱动自适应方法，动态调整批量大小。梯度多样性来自SGD收敛分析的理论基础，使算法能在保持小批量训练优势的同时提升效率。

Result: 在合成数据集和CiFar-10、CiFar-100、Tiny-ImageNet上的评估显示，DiveBatch比标准SGD和AdaBatch收敛速度快1.06-5.0倍，但性能略有下降。

Conclusion: DiveBatch通过自适应批量大小调整，在加速训练收敛的同时保持了良好的泛化性能，为高效深度学习训练提供了新思路。

Abstract: The goal of this paper is to accelerate the training of machine learning
models, a critical challenge since the training of large-scale deep neural
models can be computationally expensive. Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and
its variants are widely used to train deep neural networks. In contrast to
traditional approaches that focus on tuning the learning rate, we propose a
novel adaptive batch size SGD algorithm, DiveBatch, that dynamically adjusts
the batch size. Adapting the batch size is challenging: using large batch sizes
is more efficient due to parallel computation, but small-batch training often
converges in fewer epochs and generalizes better. To address this challenge, we
introduce a data-driven adaptation based on gradient diversity, enabling
DiveBatch to maintain the generalization performance of small-batch training
while improving convergence speed and computational efficiency. Gradient
diversity has a strong theoretical justification: it emerges from the
convergence analysis of SGD. Evaluations of DiveBatch on synthetic and
CiFar-10, CiFar-100, and Tiny-ImageNet demonstrate that DiveBatch converges
significantly faster than standard SGD and AdaBatch (1.06 -- 5.0x), with a
slight trade-off in performance.

Abstract: When do machine learning systems fail to generalize, and what mechanisms
could improve their generalization? Here, we draw inspiration from cognitive
science to argue that one weakness of machine learning systems is their failure
to exhibit latent learning -- learning information that is not relevant to the
task at hand, but that might be useful in a future task. We show how this
perspective links failures ranging from the reversal curse in language modeling
to new findings on agent-based navigation. We then highlight how cognitive
science points to episodic memory as a potential part of the solution to these
issues. Correspondingly, we show that a system with an oracle retrieval
mechanism can use learning experiences more flexibly to generalize better
across many of these challenges. We also identify some of the essential
components for effectively using retrieval, including the importance of
within-example in-context learning for acquiring the ability to use information
across retrieved examples. In summary, our results illustrate one possible
contributor to the relative data inefficiency of current machine learning
systems compared to natural intelligence, and help to understand how retrieval
methods can complement parametric learning to improve generalization.

Result: 与近期工作不同，该方法能够可靠地检测并成功反转真实的后门触发器短语。

Conclusion: 该方法为LLM后门检测提供了有效的解决方案，克服了离散输入空间和黑名单缺失等关键挑战。

Abstract: While effective backdoor detection and inversion schemes have been developed
for AIs used e.g. for images, there are challenges in "porting" these methods
to LLMs. First, the LLM input space is discrete, which precludes gradient-based
search over this space, central to many backdoor inversion methods. Second,
there are ~30,000^k k-tuples to consider, k the token-length of a putative
trigger. Third, for LLMs there is the need to blacklist tokens that have strong
marginal associations with the putative target response (class) of an attack,
as such tokens give false detection signals. However, good blacklists may not
exist for some domains. We propose a LLM trigger inversion approach with three
key components: i) discrete search, with putative triggers greedily accreted,
starting from a select list of singletons; ii) implicit blacklisting, achieved
by evaluating the average cosine similarity, in activation space, between a
candidate trigger and a small clean set of samples from the putative target
class; iii) detection when a candidate trigger elicits high misclassifications,
and with unusually high decision confidence. Unlike many recent works, we
demonstrate that our approach reliably detects and successfully inverts
ground-truth backdoor trigger phrases.
