### [1] [Evaluation of Ensemble Learning Techniques for handwritten OCR Improvement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16221)
*Martin Preiß*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究探讨了集成学习与光学字符识别（OCR）结合在历史病历数字化中的应用，发现集成学习能提高OCR准确率，且训练数据集大小不影响效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 需要高精度数字化历史手写病历，特别是在医疗领域对准确性要求更高。集成学习被声称能提高现有方法的准确率。

Method: 采用集成学习方法结合多个机器学习模型，应用于光学字符识别（OCR）技术。

Result: 集成学习能够提高OCR的准确率，发现了实现这一目标的具体方法，并且训练数据集的大小在此过程中不起决定性作用。

Conclusion: 集成学习与OCR结合可以为病历数字化创造附加价值，是一种有效的技术方案。

Abstract: For the bachelor project 2021 of Professor Lippert's research group,
handwritten entries of historical patient records needed to be digitized using
Optical Character Recognition (OCR) methods. Since the data will be used in the
future, a high degree of accuracy is naturally required. Especially in the
medical field this has even more importance. Ensemble Learning is a method that
combines several machine learning models and is claimed to be able to achieve
an increased accuracy for existing methods. For this reason, Ensemble Learning
in combination with OCR is investigated in this work in order to create added
value for the digitization of the patient records. It was possible to discover
that ensemble learning can lead to an increased accuracy for OCR, which methods
were able to achieve this and that the size of the training data set did not
play a role here.

### [2] [Agentic Reasoning for Robust Vision Systems via Increased Test-Time Compute](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16343)
*Chung-En,Yu,Brian Jalaian,Nathaniel D. Bastian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了Visual Reasoning Agent (VRA)，一个无需训练、基于代理推理的框架，通过Think-Critique-Act循环提升视觉语言模型和纯视觉系统的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在高风险领域（如遥感、医疗诊断）开发可信赖的智能视觉系统，需要在不进行昂贵重新训练的情况下实现广泛的鲁棒性。

Method: VRA采用训练免费的代理推理框架，将现成的视觉语言模型和纯视觉系统包装在Think-Critique-Act循环中。

Result: 虽然VRA在测试时增加了显著的计算开销，但在具有挑战性的视觉推理基准测试中实现了高达40%的绝对准确率提升。

Conclusion: 未来工作将优化查询路由和早停机制，以减少推理开销，同时保持视觉任务的可靠性。

Abstract: Developing trustworthy intelligent vision systems for high-stakes domains,
\emph{e.g.}, remote sensing and medical diagnosis, demands broad robustness
without costly retraining. We propose \textbf{Visual Reasoning Agent (VRA)}, a
training-free, agentic reasoning framework that wraps off-the-shelf
vision-language models \emph{and} pure vision systems in a
\emph{Think--Critique--Act} loop. While VRA incurs significant additional
test-time computation, it achieves up to 40\% absolute accuracy gains on
challenging visual reasoning benchmarks. Future work will optimize query
routing and early stopping to reduce inference overhead while preserving
reliability in vision tasks.

### [3] [From Canopy to Ground via ForestGen3D: Learning Cross-Domain Generation of 3D Forest Structure from Aerial-to-Terrestrial LiDAR](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16346)
*Juan Castorena,E. Louise Loudermilk,Scott Pokswinski,Rodman Linn*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ForestGen3D是一个基于条件去噪扩散概率模型的生成框架，能够仅使用航空激光雷达数据合成高保真度的3D森林结构，有效重建被遮挡的冠层下细节。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生态系统中的3D结构对生态过程和自然灾害影响评估至关重要，但传统的地面激光雷达测量成本高昂且难以大规模实施。

Method: 基于条件DDPMs模型，使用配准的航空/地面激光雷达数据训练，引入基于凸包的几何包含先验来确保生态合理性。

Result: 在混合针叶林生态系统中验证显示，生成的3D点云在几何相似性和生物物理指标方面与地面激光雷达参考数据高度匹配。

Conclusion: ForestGen3D为仅使用航空激光雷达的环境提供了一种可扩展的生态建模、野火模拟和结构燃料表征工具。

Abstract: The 3D structure of living and non-living components in ecosystems plays a
critical role in determining ecological processes and feedbacks from both
natural and human-driven disturbances. Anticipating the effects of wildfire,
drought, disease, or atmospheric deposition depends on accurate
characterization of 3D vegetation structure, yet widespread measurement remains
prohibitively expensive and often infeasible. We introduce ForestGen3D, a novel
generative modeling framework that synthesizes high-fidelity 3D forest
structure using only aerial LiDAR (ALS) inputs. ForestGen3D is based on
conditional denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) trained on
co-registered ALS/TLS (terrestrial LiDAR) data. The model learns to generate
TLS-like 3D point clouds conditioned on sparse ALS observations, effectively
reconstructing occluded sub-canopy detail at scale. To ensure ecological
plausibility, we introduce a geometric containment prior based on the convex
hull of ALS observations and provide theoretical and empirical guarantees that
generated structures remain spatially consistent. We evaluate ForestGen3D at
tree, plot, and landscape scales using real-world data from mixed conifer
ecosystems, and show that it produces high-fidelity reconstructions that
closely match TLS references in terms of geometric similarity and biophysical
metrics, such as tree height, DBH, crown diameter and crown volume.
Additionally, we demonstrate that the containment property can serve as a
practical proxy for generation quality in settings where TLS ground truth is
unavailable. Our results position ForestGen3D as a scalable tool for ecological
modeling, wildfire simulation, and structural fuel characterization in ALS-only
environments.

### [4] [Introducing Resizable Region Packing Problem in Image Generation, with a Heuristic Solution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16363)
*Hrishikesh Sharma*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的可调整锚定区域打包问题（RARP），这是经典装箱问题在合成图像数据生成中的实际应用，并提供了一个可扩展的启发式算法来解决该问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统图像数据生成方法存在优化问题，需要一种能够有效将任意形状区域打包到图像画布中的解决方案，以支持大规模合成数据生成。

Method: 提出了一种基于贪心策略的启发式算法，通过迭代方式仔细打包区域对，同时满足优化约束条件，能够处理任意数量、任意形状的区域。

Result: 通过实现生成了大规模合成异常检测数据集，视觉检查和解决方案正确性验证证明了算法的有效性。

Conclusion: 随着生成模型在深度学习中的兴起，新引入的RARP问题将在图像科学社区中得到重视，为合成数据生成提供理论基础。

Abstract: The problem of image data generation in computer vision has traditionally
been a harder problem to solve, than discriminative problems. Such data
generation entails placing relevant objects of appropriate sizes each, at
meaningful location in a scene canvas. There have been two classes of popular
approaches to such generation: graphics based, and generative models-based.
Optimization problems are known to lurk in the background for both these
classes of approaches. In this paper, we introduce a novel, practically useful
manifestation of the classical Bin Packing problem in the context of generation
of synthetic image data. We conjecture that the newly introduced problem,
Resizable Anchored Region Packing(RARP) Problem, is NP-hard, and provide
detailed arguments about our conjecture. As a first solution, we present a
novel heuristic algorithm that is generic enough and therefore scales and packs
arbitrary number of arbitrary-shaped regions at arbitrary locations, into an
image canvas. The algorithm follows greedy approach to iteratively pack region
pairs in a careful way, while obeying the optimization constraints. The
algorithm is validated by an implementation that was used to generate a
large-scale synthetic anomaly detection dataset, with highly varying degree of
bin packing parameters per image sample i.e. RARP instance. Visual inspection
of such data and checking of the correctness of each solution proves the
effectiveness of our algorithm. With generative modeling being on rise in deep
learning, and synthetic data generation poised to become mainstream, we expect
that the newly introduced problem will be valued in the imaging scientific
community.

### [5] [Accurate Thyroid Cancer Classification using a Novel Binary Pattern Driven Local Discrete Cosine Transform Descriptor](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16382)
*Saurabh Saini,Kapil Ahuja,Marc C. Steinbach,Thomas Wick*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究开发了一种新的甲状腺癌CAD系统，重点在于特征提取。提出了BPD-LDCT描述符，结合LDCT和ILBP来捕获纹理特征，使用非线性SVM进行分类。在两个公开数据集上取得了接近100%的分类准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 甲状腺超声图像分类具有挑战性，因为甲状腺周围复杂的解剖结构导致组织密度变化和超声波散射。需要开发能够有效捕获纹理特征并抵抗噪声的分类方法。

Method: 提出BPD-LDCT描述符，整合局部离散余弦变换(LDCT)和改进的局部二值模式(ILBP)。LDCT用于捕获局部纹理特征，ILBP提供噪声鲁棒性。最终使用非线性SVM进行分类。

Result: 在TDID数据集上：阶段I分类接近100%，阶段II分类接近100%；在AUITD数据集上：阶段I分类97%，阶段II分类99%。

Conclusion: BPD-LDCT描述符在甲状腺癌分类中表现出色，能够有效处理复杂解剖结构带来的挑战，在两个公开数据集上都取得了优异的分类性能。

Abstract: In this study, we develop a new CAD system for accurate thyroid cancer
classification with emphasis on feature extraction. Prior studies have shown
that thyroid texture is important for segregating the thyroid ultrasound images
into different classes. Based upon our experience with breast cancer
classification, we first conjuncture that the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT)
is the best descriptor for capturing textural features. Thyroid ultrasound
images are particularly challenging as the gland is surrounded by multiple
complex anatomical structures leading to variations in tissue density. Hence,
we second conjuncture the importance of localization and propose that the Local
DCT (LDCT) descriptor captures the textural features best in this context.
Another disadvantage of complex anatomy around the thyroid gland is scattering
of ultrasound waves resulting in noisy and unclear textures. Hence, we third
conjuncture that one image descriptor is not enough to fully capture the
textural features and propose the integration of another popular texture
capturing descriptor (Improved Local Binary Pattern, ILBP) with LDCT. ILBP is
known to be noise resilient as well. We term our novel descriptor as Binary
Pattern Driven Local Discrete Cosine Transform (BPD-LDCT). Final classification
is carried out using a non-linear SVM. The proposed CAD system is evaluated on
the only two publicly available thyroid cancer datasets, namely TDID and AUITD.
The evaluation is conducted in two stages. In Stage I, thyroid nodules are
categorized as benign or malignant. In Stage II, the malignant cases are
further sub-classified into TI-RADS (4) and TI-RADS (5). For Stage I
classification, our proposed model demonstrates exceptional performance of
nearly 100% on TDID and 97% on AUITD. In Stage II classification, the proposed
model again attains excellent classification of close to 100% on TDID and 99%
on AUITD.

### [6] [StereoAdapter: Adapting Stereo Depth Estimation to Underwater Scenes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16415)
*Zhengri Wu,Yiran Wang,Yu Wen,Zeyu Zhang,Biao Wu,Hao Tang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: StereoAdapter是一种参数高效的自监督框架，用于水下立体深度估计，通过LoRA适配的单目基础编码器和循环立体细化模块，在模拟和真实水下环境中相比现有方法提升6.11%和5.12%的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决水下立体深度估计中的两个关键挑战：参数高效地适应大型视觉基础编码器到水下域而无需大量标注数据，以及紧密融合全局一致但尺度模糊的单目先验与局部度量但光度脆弱的立体对应关系。

Method: 提出StereoAdapter框架，集成LoRA适配的单目基础编码器和循环立体细化模块，引入动态LoRA适配进行高效秩选择，并在合成的UW-StereoDepth-40K数据集上进行预训练以增强不同水下条件下的鲁棒性。

Result: 在模拟和真实世界基准测试中，TartanAir上提升6.11%，SQUID上提升5.12%，BlueROV2机器人上的真实世界部署进一步证明了方法的持续鲁棒性。

Conclusion: StereoAdapter框架有效解决了水下立体深度估计的挑战，通过参数高效的自监督方法实现了显著的性能提升和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Underwater stereo depth estimation provides accurate 3D geometry for robotics
tasks such as navigation, inspection, and mapping, offering metric depth from
low-cost passive cameras while avoiding the scale ambiguity of monocular
methods. However, existing approaches face two critical challenges: (i)
parameter-efficiently adapting large vision foundation encoders to the
underwater domain without extensive labeled data, and (ii) tightly fusing
globally coherent but scale-ambiguous monocular priors with locally metric yet
photometrically fragile stereo correspondences. To address these challenges, we
propose StereoAdapter, a parameter-efficient self-supervised framework that
integrates a LoRA-adapted monocular foundation encoder with a recurrent stereo
refinement module. We further introduce dynamic LoRA adaptation for efficient
rank selection and pre-training on the synthetic UW-StereoDepth-40K dataset to
enhance robustness under diverse underwater conditions. Comprehensive
evaluations on both simulated and real-world benchmarks show improvements of
6.11% on TartanAir and 5.12% on SQUID compared to state-of-the-art methods,
while real-world deployment with the BlueROV2 robot further demonstrates the
consistent robustness of our approach. Code:

### [7] [AHA -- Predicting What Matters Next: Online Highlight Detection Without Looking Ahead](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16421)
*Aiden Chang,Celso De Melo,Stephanie M. Lukin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Aha是一个自回归高光检测框架，能够在实时视频流中逐帧预测与自然语言任务相关的帧，无需访问未来帧信息，在标准基准测试中达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频理解和高光检测方法大多假设可以访问完整视频，不适合在线或流式场景。需要支持实时决策所需的逐步推理能力。

Method: 使用多模态视觉语言模型和轻量级解耦头，结合动态SinkCache机制实现恒定内存使用，通过隐藏表示捕获高级任务目标来进行帧级排名。

Result: 在TVSum和Mr.Hisum基准测试中分别比现有方法提升5.9%和8.3%的mAP，超越离线全上下文方法。

Conclusion: Aha展示了作为实时推理模块在机器人应用中的潜力，支持下游规划和长期理解任务。

Abstract: Real-time understanding of continuous video streams is essential for
intelligent agents operating in high-stakes environments, including autonomous
vehicles, surveillance drones, and disaster response robots. Yet, most existing
video understanding and highlight detection methods assume access to the entire
video during inference, making them unsuitable for online or streaming
scenarios. In particular, current models optimize for offline summarization,
failing to support step-by-step reasoning needed for real-time decision-making.
We introduce Aha, an autoregressive highlight detection framework that predicts
the relevance of each video frame against a task described in natural language.
Without accessing future video frames, Aha utilizes a multimodal
vision-language model and lightweight, decoupled heads trained on a large,
curated dataset of human-centric video labels. To enable scalability, we
introduce the Dynamic SinkCache mechanism that achieves constant memory usage
across infinite-length streams without degrading performance on standard
benchmarks. This encourages the hidden representation to capture high-level
task objectives, enabling effective frame-level rankings for informativeness,
relevance, and uncertainty with respect to the natural language task. Aha
achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on highlight detection benchmarks,
surpassing even prior offline, full-context approaches and video-language
models by +5.9% on TVSum and +8.3% on Mr.Hisum in mAP (mean Average Precision).
We explore Aha's potential for real-world robotics applications given a
task-oriented natural language input and a continuous, robot-centric video.
Both experiments demonstrate Aha's potential effectiveness as a real-time
reasoning module for downstream planning and long-horizon understanding.

### [8] [3D Gaussian Flats: Hybrid 2D/3D Photometric Scene Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16423)
*Maria Taktasheva,Lily Goli,Alessandro Fiorini,Zhen,Li,Daniel Rebain,Andrea Tagliasacchi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种混合2D/3D高斯表示方法，联合优化平面约束的2D高斯和自由形式的3D高斯，用于改进室内场景的辐射场重建质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前辐射场方法在处理平坦、无纹理表面时会产生不均匀和半透明的重建结果，而表面重建方法虽然解决了这个问题但牺牲了视觉质量。

Method: 使用端到端方法动态检测和优化平面区域，联合优化约束平面（2D）高斯和自由形式（3D）高斯表示。

Result: 在ScanNet++和ScanNetv2数据集上实现了最先进的深度估计，并在网格提取方面表现出色，不过度拟合特定相机模型。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效生成高质量的室内场景重建，同时提升视觉保真度和几何精度。

Abstract: Recent advances in radiance fields and novel view synthesis enable creation
of realistic digital twins from photographs. However, current methods struggle
with flat, texture-less surfaces, creating uneven and semi-transparent
reconstructions, due to an ill-conditioned photometric reconstruction
objective. Surface reconstruction methods solve this issue but sacrifice visual
quality. We propose a novel hybrid 2D/3D representation that jointly optimizes
constrained planar (2D) Gaussians for modeling flat surfaces and freeform (3D)
Gaussians for the rest of the scene. Our end-to-end approach dynamically
detects and refines planar regions, improving both visual fidelity and
geometric accuracy. It achieves state-of-the-art depth estimation on ScanNet++
and ScanNetv2, and excels at mesh extraction without overfitting to a specific
camera model, showing its effectiveness in producing high-quality
reconstruction of indoor scenes.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于Transformer和CNN的新型白质纤维束追踪方法，通过结合轨迹上下文和局部扩散MRI测量来提高神经通路映射的精度和完整性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统白质纤维束追踪方法在处理交叉、合并和扇形等复杂白质配置时的挑战，利用序列建模能力改进路径推断

Method: 使用Transformer建模白质流线的序列特性，结合CNN提取局部微结构特征，整合轨迹上下文和当前扩散MRI测量来预测纤维方向

Result: 在Tractometer工具包评估中取得与最先进方法竞争的性能，在TractoInferno数据集上展示出对真实数据的强泛化能力

Conclusion: 提出的Transformer-CNN混合方法能够显著提高白质纤维束追踪的精度和完整性，为神经通路映射提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: White matter tractography is an advanced neuroimaging technique that
reconstructs the 3D white matter pathways of the brain from diffusion MRI data.
It can be framed as a pathfinding problem aiming to infer neural fiber
trajectories from noisy and ambiguous measurements, facing challenges such as
crossing, merging, and fanning white-matter configurations. In this paper, we
propose a novel tractography method that leverages Transformers to model the
sequential nature of white matter streamlines, enabling the prediction of fiber
directions by integrating both the trajectory context and current diffusion MRI
measurements. To incorporate spatial information, we utilize CNNs that extract
microstructural features from local neighborhoods around each voxel. By
combining these complementary sources of information, our approach improves the
precision and completeness of neural pathway mapping compared to traditional
tractography models. We evaluate our method with the Tractometer toolkit,
achieving competitive performance against state-of-the-art approaches, and
present qualitative results on the TractoInferno dataset, demonstrating strong
generalization to real-world data.

### [10] [Improved mmFormer for Liver Fibrosis Staging via Missing-Modality Compensation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16436)
*Zhejia Zhang,Junjie Wang,Le Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出基于mmFormer架构的多模态MRI分类模型，通过自适应模块处理任意缺失模态组合，在CARE 2025挑战赛的肝脏纤维化分期任务中取得良好性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实临床环境中MRI常因设备差异或患者配合问题出现模态缺失，严重影响模型性能，需要开发能够处理缺失模态的鲁棒方法。

Method: 保留mmFormer的混合模态特定编码器和模态相关编码器，集成缺失模态补偿模块（零填充、模态可用性掩码、可学习统计参数的Delta函数），并采用交叉验证集成策略。

Result: 在CARE 2025测试集上，肝硬化检测准确率66.67%、AUC 71.73%，显著纤维化检测准确率74.17%、AUC 68.48%。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效处理MRI模态缺失问题，在肝脏疾病诊断中表现出良好的鲁棒性和实用性。

Abstract: In real-world clinical settings, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) frequently
suffers from missing modalities due to equipment variability or patient
cooperation issues, which can significantly affect model performance. To
address this issue, we propose a multimodal MRI classification model based on
the mmFormer architecture with an adaptive module for handling arbitrary
combinations of missing modalities. Specifically, this model retains the hybrid
modality-specific encoders and the modality-correlated encoder from mmFormer to
extract consistent lesion features across available modalities. In addition, we
integrate a missing-modality compensation module which leverages zero-padding,
modality availability masks, and a Delta Function with learnable statistical
parameters to dynamically synthesize proxy features for recovering missing
information. To further improve prediction performance, we adopt a
cross-validation ensemble strategy by training multiple models on different
folds and applying soft voting during inference. This method is evaluated on
the test set of Comprehensive Analysis & Computing of REal-world medical images
(CARE) 2025 challenge, targeting the Liver Fibrosis Staging (LiFS) task based
on non-contrast dynamic MRI scans including T1-weighted imaging (T1WI),
T2-weighted imaging (T2WI), and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI). For Cirrhosis
Detection and Substantial Fibrosis Detection on in-distribution vendors, our
model obtains accuracies of 66.67%, and 74.17%, and corresponding area under
the curve (AUC) scores of 71.73% and 68.48%, respectively.

### [11] [AutoArabic: A Three-Stage Framework for Localizing Video-Text Retrieval Benchmarks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16438)
*Mohamed Eltahir,Osamah Sarraj,Abdulrahman Alfrihidi,Taha Alshatiri,Mohammed Khurd,Mohammed Bremoo,Tanveer Hussain*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AutoArabic是一个三阶段框架，利用大语言模型将非阿拉伯语视频文本基准翻译成现代标准阿拉伯语，显著减少人工修订工作量，并开发了阿拉伯语视频检索基准DiDeMo-AR。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视频文本检索领域主要基于英语基准，阿拉伯语缺乏本地化评估指标和数据集，需要解决这一语言服务不足的问题。

Method: 采用三阶段框架：1）使用LLM进行翻译；2）错误检测模块自动标记潜在翻译错误（准确率97%）；3）生成阿拉伯语变体数据集。应用该框架到DiDeMo基准，创建DiDeMo-AR数据集。

Result: 成功创建包含40,144条流畅阿拉伯语描述的DiDeMo-AR数据集。在阿拉伯语和英语变体上训练CLIP风格基线模型，发现性能差距约3个百分点，表明阿拉伯语本地化保持了基准难度。三种后编辑预算评估显示性能随编辑量增加而单调提升。

Conclusion: AutoArabic框架有效解决了阿拉伯语视频文本检索基准缺乏的问题，错误检测模块准确率高，LLM原始输出即可使用，框架可复现到其他语言。

Abstract: Video-to-text and text-to-video retrieval are dominated by English benchmarks
(e.g. DiDeMo, MSR-VTT) and recent multilingual corpora (e.g. RUDDER), yet
Arabic remains underserved, lacking localized evaluation metrics. We introduce
a three-stage framework, AutoArabic, utilizing state-of-the-art large language
models (LLMs) to translate non-Arabic benchmarks into Modern Standard Arabic,
reducing the manual revision required by nearly fourfold. The framework
incorporates an error detection module that automatically flags potential
translation errors with 97% accuracy. Applying the framework to DiDeMo, a video
retrieval benchmark produces DiDeMo-AR, an Arabic variant with 40,144 fluent
Arabic descriptions. An analysis of the translation errors is provided and
organized into an insightful taxonomy to guide future Arabic localization
efforts. We train a CLIP-style baseline with identical hyperparameters on the
Arabic and English variants of the benchmark, finding a moderate performance
gap (about 3 percentage points at Recall@1), indicating that Arabic
localization preserves benchmark difficulty. We evaluate three post-editing
budgets (zero/ flagged-only/ full) and find that performance improves
monotonically with more post-editing, while the raw LLM output (zero-budget)
remains usable. To ensure reproducibility to other languages, we made the code
available at https://github.com/Tahaalshatiri/AutoArabic.

Result: 在ETRI-Activity3D数据集上的实验表明，该方法仅使用RGB视频输入即可达到超过95%的准确率，超越了现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: 知识增强提示在实现最小监督下的鲁棒动作识别方面具有显著效果。

Abstract: Accurate vision-based action recognition is crucial for developing autonomous
robots that can operate safely and reliably in complex, real-world
environments. In this work, we advance video-based recognition of indoor daily
actions for robotic perception by leveraging vision-language models (VLMs)
enriched with domain-specific knowledge. We adapt a prompt-learning framework
in which class-level textual descriptions of each action are embedded as
learnable prompts into a frozen pre-trained VLM backbone. Several strategies
for structuring and encoding these textual descriptions are designed and
evaluated. Experiments on the ETRI-Activity3D dataset demonstrate that our
method, using only RGB video inputs at test time, achieves over 95\% accuracy
and outperforms state-of-the-art approaches. These results highlight the
effectiveness of knowledge-augmented prompts in enabling robust action
recognition with minimal supervision.

Conclusion: 该方法在临床和生物识别领域推进了可解释的步态分析。

Abstract: Gait is a key indicator in diagnosing movement disorders, but most models
lack interpretability and rely on single datasets. We propose a dual-branch
CNN-LSTM framework a 1D branch on joint-based features from GAVD and a 3D
branch on silhouettes from OU-MVLP. Interpretability is provided by SHAP
(temporal attributions) and Grad-CAM (spatial localization).On held-out sets,
the system achieves 98.6% accuracy with strong recall and F1. This approach
advances explainable gait analysis across both clinical and biometric domains.

TL;DR: 提出一个利用时间序列和图像数据的联合分类器框架，用于通过手写分析检测神经系统疾病，在多个数据集上取得优异性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在跨数据集泛化方面存在困难，特别是时间序列和图像特征之间的转换问题，需要一种能够统一处理不同形式手写信号的方法

Method: 基于ImageNet-1k预训练的ResNet50构建联合分类器，同时处理手写任务的时间序列和图像数据

Conclusion: 该模型能够有效泛化到不同形式的手写信号，增强神经系统疾病中运动缺陷的检测能力

Abstract: Handwriting is significantly affected by neurological disorders (ND) such as
Parkinson's disease (PD) and Alzheimer's disease (AD). Prior works have
analyzed handwriting tasks using feature-based approaches or computer-vision
techniques, but these methods have struggled to generalize across multiple
datasets, particularly between temporal features represented as time-series and
images. We propose a framework that leverages both time-series and images of
handwriting through a joint classifier, based on a ResNet50 pretrained on
ImageNet-1k. Binary classification experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art
performances on existing time-series and image datasets, with significant
improvement on specific drawing and writing tasks from the NeuroLogical Signals
(NLS) dataset. In particular, the proposed model demonstrates improved
performance on Draw Clock and Spiral tasks. Additionally, cross-dataset and
multi-dataset experiments were consistently able to achieve high F1 scores, up
to 98 for PD detection, highlighting the potential of the proposed model to
generalize over different forms of handwriting signals, and enhance the
detection of motor deficits in ND.

### [15] [Eye Gaze Tells You Where to Compute: Gaze-Driven Efficient VLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16476)
*Qinyu Chen,Jiawen Qi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GazeVLM是一个无需训练的高效视觉语言模型框架，利用人眼注视作为监督信号来减少视觉token冗余，在保持答案质量的同时显著提升推理效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型存在视觉token冗余问题，导致推理效率低下，阻碍在边缘设备上的实时应用。现有方法需要架构修改或中间激活访问，增加了计算和内存开销，且存在提示与感兴趣区域不对齐的问题。

Method: 通过提取注视驱动的感兴趣区域，并结合低分辨率全局视图，模拟人类视网膜中央凹-外周感知，在保留任务相关细节的同时减少冗余视觉token。

Result: 在VOILA-COCO基准测试中，GazeVLM将视觉token减少高达93.1%，总token减少59.6%，FLOPs减少50%，同时保持优于全分辨率基线的答案质量。

Conclusion: 将模型计算与人类注视对齐，为消费设备上的高效VLM推理提供了一种简单、即插即用的解决方案。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) deliver impressive performance in understanding
visual content with language instructions. However, redundancy in vision tokens
results in the degenerated inference efficiency of VLMs, which hinders
real-time use on edge consumer devices such as AR/VR devices. Existing
efficiency methods commonly prune visual tokens using learned saliency, sparse
attention schedules, or controller policies, but they often require
architectural modification or access to intermediate activations. These
pipelines add inference-time modules that increase compute and memory and often
lead to an accuracy trade-off. Moreover, they also suffer from misalignment
between the prompts and the region of interest in the images. Without human
guidance, the model may focus on the wrong regions and miss small,
high-frequency details when prompts or scenes change. In this paper, we propose
GazeVLM, a training-free framework that uses the human eye gaze as a natural
supervisory signal to allocate computation where it matters. By extracting
gaze-driven regions of interest (ROIs) and optionally combining them with a
low-resolution global view, GazeVLM mimics fovea-periphery perception to cut
redundant visual tokens while preserving task-relevant details. We evaluate the
visual question answering tasks on Qwen2.5-VL-3B/7B on the VOILA-COCO benchmark
with human gaze. Quality of the answer is assessed by GPT-4o pairwise judging
and a weighted score over coverage, accuracy, details, and fluency. Efficiency
is measured by token counts and FLOPs. GazeVLM reduces visual tokens by up to
93.1%, total tokens by up to 59.6%, and FLOPs by 50%, while keeping better
answer quality relative to full-resolution baselines. Our results show that
aligning model computation with human gaze offers a simple, plug-and-play path
toward efficient VLM inference on consumer devices.

Abstract: Falls among seniors are a major public health issue. Existing solutions using
wearable sensors, ambient sensors, and RGB-based vision systems face challenges
in reliability, user compliance, and practicality. Studies indicate that
stakeholders, such as older adults and eldercare facilities, prefer
non-wearable, passive, privacy-preserving, and real-time fall detection systems
that require no user interaction. This study proposes an advanced thermal fall
detection method using a Bidirectional Convolutional Long Short-Term Memory
(BiConvLSTM) model, enhanced with spatial, temporal, feature, self, and general
attention mechanisms. Through systematic experimentation across hundreds of
model variations exploring the integration of attention mechanisms, recurrent
modules, and motion flow, we identified top-performing architectures. Among
them, BiConvLSTM achieved state-of-the-art performance with a ROC-AUC of
$99.7\%$ on the TSF dataset and demonstrated robust results on TF-66, a newly
emerged, diverse, and privacy-preserving benchmark. These results highlight the
generalizability and practicality of the proposed model, setting new standards
for thermal fall detection and paving the way toward deployable,
high-performance solutions.

TL;DR: 提出Octree Latent Semantic Diffusion统一框架，可在室内外场景中完成3D语义场景的补全、扩展和生成，使用双八叉图潜在表示实现高效处理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将3D语义场景的补全、扩展和生成问题解耦处理，且多为领域特定模型，缺乏跨域兼容性。需要统一框架来解决这些问题。

Method: 采用双八叉图潜在表示，分两阶段生成：结构扩散预测粗粒度八叉树，潜在语义扩散生成语义嵌入并通过图VAE解码为体素级语义标签。支持推理时潜在修复和外推。

Result: 展示了高质量结构、连贯语义和从单次LiDAR扫描的鲁棒补全能力，以及对分布外LiDAR数据的零样本泛化能力。

Conclusion: 基于双八叉图潜在空间的生成式补全方法是实际可行的替代方案，适用于机器人感知任务。

Abstract: The completion, extension, and generation of 3D semantic scenes are an
interrelated set of capabilities that are useful for robotic navigation and
exploration. Existing approaches seek to decouple these problems and solve them
oneoff. Additionally, these approaches are often domain-specific, requiring
separate models for different data distributions, e.g. indoor vs. outdoor
scenes. To unify these techniques and provide cross-domain compatibility, we
develop a single framework that can perform scene completion, extension, and
generation in both indoor and outdoor scenes, which we term Octree Latent
Semantic Diffusion. Our approach operates directly on an efficient dual octree
graph latent representation: a hierarchical, sparse, and memory-efficient
occupancy structure. This technique disentangles synthesis into two stages: (i)
structure diffusion, which predicts binary split signals to construct a coarse
occupancy octree, and (ii) latent semantic diffusion, which generates semantic
embeddings decoded by a graph VAE into voxellevel semantic labels. To perform
semantic scene completion or extension, our model leverages inference-time
latent inpainting, or outpainting respectively. These inference-time methods
use partial LiDAR scans or maps to condition generation, without the need for
retraining or finetuning. We demonstrate highquality structure, coherent
semantics, and robust completion from single LiDAR scans, as well as zero-shot
generalization to out-of-distribution LiDAR data. These results indicate that
completion-through-generation in a dual octree graph latent space is a
practical and scalable alternative to regression-based pipelines for real-world
robotic perception tasks.

TL;DR: 本文提出RLGF方法，通过强化学习结合几何反馈来改进视频扩散模型，解决合成数据在自动驾驶感知任务中的几何失真问题，显著提升3D目标检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前最先进的视频生成模型虽然视觉逼真，但存在细微的几何失真，限制了其在自动驾驶下游感知任务中的实用性。作者识别并量化了这一关键问题，展示了使用合成数据与真实数据在3D目标检测性能上的显著差距。

Method: 引入强化学习与几何反馈（RLGF）方法，通过专门的潜在空间自动驾驶感知模型提供奖励来优化视频扩散模型。核心组件包括：高效的潜在空间窗口优化技术用于扩散过程中的针对性反馈，以及分层几何奖励系统提供点-线-面对齐和场景占用一致性的多级奖励。

Result: 在nuScenes数据集上的DiVE模型应用RLGF后，几何误差显著降低（VP误差减少21%，深度误差减少57%），3D目标检测mAP提升12.7%，大幅缩小了与真实数据性能的差距。

Conclusion: RLGF提供了一种即插即用的解决方案，能够生成几何正确且可靠的自动驾驶开发用合成视频。

Abstract: Synthetic data is crucial for advancing autonomous driving (AD) systems, yet
current state-of-the-art video generation models, despite their visual realism,
suffer from subtle geometric distortions that limit their utility for
downstream perception tasks. We identify and quantify this critical issue,
demonstrating a significant performance gap in 3D object detection when using
synthetic versus real data. To address this, we introduce Reinforcement
Learning with Geometric Feedback (RLGF), RLGF uniquely refines video diffusion
models by incorporating rewards from specialized latent-space AD perception
models. Its core components include an efficient Latent-Space Windowing
Optimization technique for targeted feedback during diffusion, and a
Hierarchical Geometric Reward (HGR) system providing multi-level rewards for
point-line-plane alignment, and scene occupancy coherence. To quantify these
distortions, we propose GeoScores. Applied to models like DiVE on nuScenes,
RLGF substantially reduces geometric errors (e.g., VP error by 21\%, Depth
error by 57\%) and dramatically improves 3D object detection mAP by 12.7\%,
narrowing the gap to real-data performance. RLGF offers a plug-and-play
solution for generating geometrically sound and reliable synthetic videos for
AD development.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决表单字段检测问题，填补大规模数据集和开源模型的空白，为文档处理提供更好的解决方案。

Method: 将表单字段检测建模为目标检测问题，通过过滤Common Crawl构建数据集，开发FFDNet-Small和FFDNet-Large模型。

Result: FFDNet模型在CommonForms测试集上达到很高平均精度，训练成本低于500美元，优于商业PDF阅读器，并能检测复选框。

Conclusion: 这是首个大规模表单字段检测数据集和开源模型，为文档处理领域提供了重要资源，高分辨率输入对检测质量至关重要。

Abstract: This paper introduces CommonForms, a web-scale dataset for form field
detection. It casts the problem of form field detection as object detection:
given an image of a page, predict the location and type (Text Input, Choice
Button, Signature) of form fields. The dataset is constructed by filtering
Common Crawl to find PDFs that have fillable elements. Starting with 8 million
documents, the filtering process is used to arrive at a final dataset of
roughly 55k documents that have over 450k pages. Analysis shows that the
dataset contains a diverse mixture of languages and domains; one third of the
pages are non-English, and among the 14 classified domains, no domain makes up
more than 25% of the dataset.
  In addition, this paper presents a family of form field detectors,
FFDNet-Small and FFDNet-Large, which attain a very high average precision on
the CommonForms test set. Each model cost less than $500 to train. Ablation
results show that high-resolution inputs are crucial for high-quality form
field detection, and that the cleaning process improves data efficiency over
using all PDFs that have fillable fields in Common Crawl. A qualitative
analysis shows that they outperform a popular, commercially available PDF
reader that can prepare forms. Unlike the most popular commercially available
solutions, FFDNet can predict checkboxes in addition to text and signature
fields. This is, to our knowledge, the first large scale dataset released for
form field detection, as well as the first open source models. The dataset,
models, and code will be released at https://github.com/jbarrow/commonforms

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于扩散模型的视频超分辨率方法在视频质量和推理效率之间存在权衡，需要多步采样过程，效率较低。

Method: 设计了相邻帧对抗训练范式来提高合成视频质量，并采用多帧融合机制来保持帧间时间一致性并减少视频闪烁。

Result: 在多个流行VSR基准测试上的实验表明，OS-DiffVSR甚至能够比需要数十个采样步骤的现有扩散VSR方法获得更好的质量。

Conclusion: OS-DiffVSR成功解决了扩散模型在视频超分辨率任务中效率与质量的权衡问题，实现了单步高质量视频重建。

Abstract: Recently, latent diffusion models has demonstrated promising performance in
real-world video super-resolution (VSR) task, which can reconstruct
high-quality videos from distorted low-resolution input through multiple
diffusion steps. Compared to image super-resolution (ISR), VSR methods needs to
process each frame in a video, which poses challenges to its inference
efficiency. However, video quality and inference efficiency have always been a
trade-off for the diffusion-based VSR methods. In this work, we propose
One-Step Diffusion model for real-world Video Super-Resolution, namely
OS-DiffVSR. Specifically, we devise a novel adjacent frame adversarial training
paradigm, which can significantly improve the quality of synthetic videos.
Besides, we devise a multi-frame fusion mechanism to maintain inter-frame
temporal consistency and reduce the flicker in video. Extensive experiments on
several popular VSR benchmarks demonstrate that OS-DiffVSR can even achieve
better quality than existing diffusion-based VSR methods that require dozens of
sampling steps.

*Haijin Zeng,Xuan Lu,Yurong Zhang,Yongyong Chen,Jingyong Su,Jie Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SlowFast-SCI是一个双速度深度学习框架，首次将测试时自适应引入光谱压缩成像的深度展开网络，通过慢速预训练和快速自适应学习，实现了参数减少70%、计算量降低70%、在分布外数据上PSNR提升5.79dB的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度展开方法仅模拟人类学习的慢速过程，依赖大量预训练但缺乏快速适应新光学配置的能力，导致在分布外相机上表现不佳，且计算量大、推理速度慢。

Method: 采用双阶段设计：慢速学习阶段预训练或重用基于先验的主干网络，通过成像指导蒸馏到紧凑的快速展开模型；快速学习阶段在每个块中嵌入轻量级自适应模块，通过双域损失进行测试时自监督训练，无需重新训练主干网络。

Result: 实现了70%的参数和FLOPs减少，在分布外数据上PSNR提升高达5.79dB，保持跨域适应性，适应速度提升4倍，且模块化设计可与任何深度展开网络集成。

Conclusion: SlowFast-SCI将离线鲁棒性与在线每样本校准相结合，为自适应、可部署的成像系统和扩展的计算成像模态开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Humans learn in two complementary ways: a slow, cumulative process that
builds broad, general knowledge, and a fast, on-the-fly process that captures
specific experiences. Existing deep-unfolding methods for spectral compressive
imaging (SCI) mirror only the slow component-relying on heavy pre-training with
many unfolding stages-yet they lack the rapid adaptation needed to handle new
optical configurations. As a result, they falter on out-of-distribution
cameras, especially in bespoke spectral setups unseen during training. This
depth also incurs heavy computation and slow inference. To bridge this gap, we
introduce SlowFast-SCI, a dual-speed framework seamlessly integrated into any
deep unfolding network beyond SCI systems. During slow learning, we pre-train
or reuse a priors-based backbone and distill it via imaging guidance into a
compact fast-unfolding model. In the fast learning stage, lightweight
adaptation modules are embedded within each block and trained self-supervised
at test time via a dual-domain loss-without retraining the backbone. To the
best of our knowledge, SlowFast-SCI is the first test-time adaptation-driven
deep unfolding framework for efficient, self-adaptive spectral reconstruction.
Its dual-stage design unites offline robustness with on-the-fly per-sample
calibration-yielding over 70% reduction in parameters and FLOPs, up to 5.79 dB
PSNR improvement on out-of-distribution data, preserved cross-domain
adaptability, and a 4x faster adaptation speed. In addition, its modularity
integrates with any deep-unfolding network, paving the way for self-adaptive,
field-deployable imaging and expanded computational imaging modalities. Code
and models are available at https://github.com/XuanLu11/SlowFast-SCI.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了Seeing Culture Benchmark (SCB)，这是一个专注于文化推理的多模态视觉语言模型基准测试，要求模型在两个阶段进行推理：多选视觉问答和分割相关文化文物作为推理证据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文化数据集在提供文化推理方面存在不足，且许多文化代表性不足。SCB旨在解决这些问题，特别关注经常被忽视的东南亚文化。

Method: SCB采用两阶段评估方法：第一阶段要求模型从三个系统组织的视觉选项类型中选择正确答案；第二阶段要求分割相关文化文物作为推理证据。基准包含1,065张图像，涵盖7个东南亚国家的138种文化文物。

Result: 对各种VLMs的评估揭示了跨模态文化推理的复杂性，并突显了在文化细微场景中视觉推理和空间定位之间的差距。

Conclusion: SCB作为一个关键基准，有助于识别当前VLMs在文化推理方面的不足，为未来文化推理领域的发展提供指导。

Abstract: Multimodal vision-language models (VLMs) have made substantial progress in
various tasks that require a combined understanding of visual and textual
content, particularly in cultural understanding tasks, with the emergence of
new cultural datasets. However, these datasets frequently fall short of
providing cultural reasoning while underrepresenting many cultures. In this
paper, we introduce the Seeing Culture Benchmark (SCB), focusing on cultural
reasoning with a novel approach that requires VLMs to reason on culturally rich
images in two stages: i) selecting the correct visual option with
multiple-choice visual question answering (VQA), and ii) segmenting the
relevant cultural artifact as evidence of reasoning. Visual options in the
first stage are systematically organized into three types: those originating
from the same country, those from different countries, or a mixed group.
Notably, all options are derived from a singular category for each type.
Progression to the second stage occurs only after a correct visual option is
chosen. The SCB benchmark comprises 1,065 images that capture 138 cultural
artifacts across five categories from seven Southeast Asia countries, whose
diverse cultures are often overlooked, accompanied by 3,178 questions, of which
1,093 are unique and meticulously curated by human annotators. Our evaluation
of various VLMs reveals the complexities involved in cross-modal cultural
reasoning and highlights the disparity between visual reasoning and spatial
grounding in culturally nuanced scenarios. The SCB serves as a crucial
benchmark for identifying these shortcomings, thereby guiding future
developments in the field of cultural reasoning.

TL;DR: FG-Attn是一种针对长上下文扩散变换器的细粒度稀疏注意力机制，通过异步聚集加载操作实现比块稀疏注意力更精细的计算跳过，在视频扩散模型中实现1.41-1.65倍的加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散变换器生成视频时计算量巨大，注意力层是主要瓶颈。现有块稀疏注意力方法跳过整个M×M块，未能充分利用注意力图中的稀疏性，存在改进空间。

Method: 提出FG-Attn稀疏注意力机制，在M×1切片粒度上跳过计算，开发异步聚集加载操作从内存中收集稀疏相关键值向量并打包到GPU共享内存中。

Result: 在单H100 GPU上，对5秒480p视频平均加速1.55倍（最高1.65倍），对5秒720p视频平均加速1.41倍（最高1.49倍）。

Conclusion: FG-Attn通过细粒度稀疏注意力有效减少了扩散变换器的计算开销，显著提升了视频生成效率。

Abstract: Generating realistic videos with diffusion transformers demands significant
computation, with attention layers the central bottleneck; even producing a
short clip requires running a transformer over a very long sequence of
embeddings, e.g., more than 30K embeddings for a 5-second video, incurring
significant latency. Prior work aims to mitigate this bottleneck by exploiting
sparsity in the attention layers to reduce computation. However, these works
typically rely on block-sparse attention, which skips score computation only
when all entries in a block of attention scores (corresponding to M queries and
M keys, with M = 64 typically) are zero. This coarse-granular skipping of
attention scores does not fully exploit sparsity in the attention map and
leaves room for improvement. In this work, we propose FG-Attn, a sparse
attention mechanism for long-context diffusion transformers that leverages
sparsity at a fine granularity. Unlike block-sparse attention, which skips
entire MxM blocks, our approach skips computations at the granularity of Mx1
slices of the attention map. Each slice is produced by query-key dot products
between a block of query vectors and a single key. To implement our proposed
sparse attention mechanism, we develop a new efficient bulk-load operation
called asynchronous-gather load. This load operation gathers a sparse set of
relevant key-value vectors from memory and arranges them into packed tiles in
the GPU's shared memory. Only a sparse set of keys relevant to those queries
are loaded into shared memory when computing attention for a block of queries,
in contrast to loading full blocks of key tokens in block-sparse attention. Our
fine-grained sparse attention, applied to video diffusion models, achieves an
average 1.55X (up to 1.65X) speedup for 5 second, 480p videos, and an average
1.41X (up to 1.49X) for 5 second, 720p videos on a single H100 GPU.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉跟踪方法在处理真实世界像素动态性方面存在局限，需要一种能够在线实时适应复杂视觉场景的跟踪方法

Method: LBM将视觉表示分解为动态像素格子，通过多层预测-更新网络估计像素位置和可见性。预测阶段在空间邻域内进行格子碰撞，在时间视觉上下文中进行格子流；更新阶段使用在线视觉表示修正像素分布

Result: 在TAP-Vid和RoboTAP等真实世界点跟踪基准测试中验证了LBM的效率，在TAO、BFT和OVT-B等大规模开放世界目标跟踪基准测试中展示了实际应用价值

Conclusion: LBM在在线实时方式下展现出实际适用性，能够高效适应真实世界视觉跟踪任务

Abstract: This work proposes the Lattice Boltzmann Model (LBM) to learn real-world
pixel dynamicity for visual tracking. LBM decomposes visual representations
into dynamic pixel lattices and solves pixel motion states through
collision-streaming processes. Specifically, the high-dimensional distribution
of the target pixels is acquired through a multilayer predict-update network to
estimate the pixel positions and visibility. The predict stage formulates
lattice collisions among the spatial neighborhood of target pixels and develops
lattice streaming within the temporal visual context. The update stage
rectifies the pixel distributions with online visual representations. Compared
with existing methods, LBM demonstrates practical applicability in an online
and real-time manner, which can efficiently adapt to real-world visual tracking
tasks. Comprehensive evaluations of real-world point tracking benchmarks such
as TAP-Vid and RoboTAP validate LBM's efficiency. A general evaluation of
large-scale open-world object tracking benchmarks such as TAO, BFT, and OVT-B
further demonstrates LBM's real-world practicality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频字幕评估方法依赖人工标注的真实字幕，这在多样化视频领域中成本高昂且不切实际，需要开发无需参考基准的评估方案。

Method: 使用大语言模型基于监督数据生成不同质量的伪字幕，然后训练多模态模型（Qwen2.5-VL）作为评估器，实现参考无关的事实基础评估。

Result: 在VATEX-Eval数据集上表现出与人类判断更好的对齐，性能优于现有方法，并能推广到图像字幕数据集。

Conclusion: VC-Inspector为视频字幕的事实准确性评估提供了可扩展和通用的解决方案，为多样化视频领域提供更有效和客观的评估方法。

Abstract: Video captions offer concise snapshots of actors, objects, and actions within
a video, serving as valuable assets for applications such as question answering
and event localization. However, acquiring human annotations for video captions
is costly or even impractical, especially when dealing with diverse video
domains. Existing models trained on supervised datasets face challenges in
evaluating performance across different domains due to the reliance on
reference-based evaluation protocols, which necessitate ground truth captions.
This assumption is unrealistic for evaluating videos in the wild. To address
these limitations, we propose a reference-free evaluation framework that does
not require ground truth captions, focusing on factual grounding to ensure
accurate assessment of caption quality. We introduce VC-Inspector, a novel
caption quality evaluator that is both reference-free and factually grounded.
Utilizing large language models, we generate pseudo captions of varying quality
based on supervised data, which are subsequently used to train a multimodal
model (i.e., Qwen2.5-VL) as the evaluator. Our approach demonstrates superior
alignment with human judgments on the VATEX-Eval dataset, outperforming
existing methods. The performance also generalizes to image caption datasets,
Flickr8K-Expert and Flickr8K-CF, when viewing images as 1-frame videos.
Overall, VC-Inspector offers a scalable and generalizable solution for
evaluating the factual accuracy of video captions, paving the way for more
effective and objective assessment methodologies in diverse video domains.

Abstract: Image fusion is a fundamental and important task in computer vision, aiming
to combine complementary information from different modalities to fuse images.
In recent years, diffusion models have made significant developments in the
field of image fusion. However, diffusion models often require complex
computations and redundant inference time, which reduces the applicability of
these methods. To address this issue, we propose RFfusion, an efficient
one-step diffusion model for image fusion based on Rectified Flow. We
incorporate Rectified Flow into the image fusion task to straighten the
sampling path in the diffusion model, achieving one-step sampling without the
need for additional training, while still maintaining high-quality fusion
results. Furthermore, we propose a task-specific variational autoencoder (VAE)
architecture tailored for image fusion, where the fusion operation is embedded
within the latent space to further reduce computational complexity. To address
the inherent discrepancy between conventional reconstruction-oriented VAE
objectives and the requirements of image fusion, we introduce a two-stage
training strategy. This approach facilitates the effective learning and
integration of complementary information from multi-modal source images,
thereby enabling the model to retain fine-grained structural details while
significantly enhancing inference efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our method outperforms other state-of-the-art methods in terms of both
inference speed and fusion quality. Code is available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有基于高斯的方法在多视角空间交互不足和多帧时间一致性有限的问题

Method: 采用指导信息空间聚合策略和几何感知时间融合方案，结合双模式注意力机制

Result: 在nuScenes基准测试中达到最先进性能，时间一致性显著优于现有高斯方法

Conclusion: ST-GS框架有效提升了3D占用预测的空间和时间建模能力

Abstract: 3D occupancy prediction is critical for comprehensive scene understanding in
vision-centric autonomous driving. Recent advances have explored utilizing 3D
semantic Gaussians to model occupancy while reducing computational overhead,
but they remain constrained by insufficient multi-view spatial interaction and
limited multi-frame temporal consistency. To overcome these issues, in this
paper, we propose a novel Spatial-Temporal Gaussian Splatting (ST-GS) framework
to enhance both spatial and temporal modeling in existing Gaussian-based
pipelines. Specifically, we develop a guidance-informed spatial aggregation
strategy within a dual-mode attention mechanism to strengthen spatial
interaction in Gaussian representations. Furthermore, we introduce a
geometry-aware temporal fusion scheme that effectively leverages historical
context to improve temporal continuity in scene completion. Extensive
experiments on the large-scale nuScenes occupancy prediction benchmark showcase
that our proposed approach not only achieves state-of-the-art performance but
also delivers markedly better temporal consistency compared to existing
Gaussian-based methods.

Motivation: 在飞机驾驶舱、航空航天维护和手术等高风险环境中，需要可靠的AR个性化辅助技术，其中人-物交互识别和用户识别至关重要

Method: 提出I2S多阶段框架：首先提取3D手部姿态的手工特征，包括空间、频率、运动学、方向和新型IHSE描述符；然后依次进行物体分类、HOI识别和用户识别

Result: 在ARCTIC和H2O数据集上的实验显示，最优配置达到97.52%的平均F1分数，模型大小小于4MB，推理时间0.1秒

Conclusion: I2S框架在保持轻量级的同时实现了最先进的性能，非常适合安全关键的AR系统中实时设备认证

Abstract: Human-Object Interaction Recognition (HOIR) and user identification play a
crucial role in advancing augmented reality (AR)-based personalized assistive
technologies. These systems are increasingly being deployed in high-stakes,
human-centric environments such as aircraft cockpits, aerospace maintenance,
and surgical procedures. This research introduces I2S (Interact2Sign), a multi
stage framework designed for unobtrusive user identification through human
object interaction recognition, leveraging 3D hand pose analysis in egocentric
videos. I2S utilizes handcrafted features extracted from 3D hand poses and per
forms sequential feature augmentation: first identifying the object class,
followed by HOI recognition, and ultimately, user identification. A
comprehensive feature extraction and description process was carried out for 3D
hand poses, organizing the extracted features into semantically meaningful
categories: Spatial, Frequency, Kinematic, Orientation, and a novel descriptor
introduced in this work, the Inter-Hand Spatial Envelope (IHSE). Extensive
ablation studies were conducted to determine the most effective combination of
features. The optimal configuration achieved an impressive average F1-score of
97.52% for user identification, evaluated on a bimanual object manipulation
dataset derived from the ARCTIC and H2O datasets. I2S demonstrates
state-of-the-art performance while maintaining a lightweight model size of
under 4 MB and a fast inference time of 0.1 seconds. These characteristics make
the proposed framework highly suitable for real-time, on-device authentication
in security-critical, AR-based systems.

TL;DR: CaRe-DPO是一个针对文本-视频检索任务的框架，通过直接优化检索相关性得分来生成细粒度的辅助字幕，解决现有MLLM生成字幕过于通用的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多模态大语言模型生成的辅助字幕往往过于通用，难以区分视觉相似的视频，限制了细粒度检索的效果。传统的字幕评估指标（如BLEU）也不适用于需要区分候选视频的检索任务。

Method: 提出CaRe-DPO框架，核心是双组直接偏好优化（DG-DPO）学习策略，通过建模不同视频和字幕对之间的偏好来监督字幕生成。同时设计了基于MLLM的检索模型，使用角色嵌入来区分不同功能的文本输入。

Result: 通过大量实验证明，CaRe-DPO能够有效利用辅助知识生成细粒度字幕，显著提升检索性能。

Conclusion: CaRe-DPO框架通过直接优化检索相关性的方式，解决了现有字幕生成方法在文本-视频检索任务中的局限性，为细粒度跨模态检索提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: In text-video retrieval, auxiliary captions are often used to enhance video
understanding, bridging the gap between the modalities. While recent advances
in multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have enabled strong zero-shot
caption generation, we observe that such captions tend to be generic and
indistinguishable across visually similar videos, limiting their utility for
fine-grained retrieval. Moreover, conventional captioning approaches are
typically evaluated using language generation metrics, such as BLEU, which are
not typically tailored for retrieval tasks that require making discriminative
distinctions between candidates. To address this, we propose
$\textbf{CaRe-DPO}$, a retrieval framework that directly optimizes caption
generation using retrieval relevance scores. At its core is Dual-Group Direct
Preference Optimization (DG-DPO), a novel learning strategy that supervises
captioning by modeling preferences across groups of distinct video and caption
pairs. In addition, we present an MLLM-based retrieval model that incorporates
role-embeddings to better distinguish between textual inputs with different
functional roles, such as an auxiliary caption and a text query. Through
extensive experiments, we demonstrate that CaRe-DPO significantly enhances
retrieval performance by effectively leveraging auxiliary knowledge to generate
fine-grained captions for retrieval. Code is available at

Abstract: Recent black-box counterfactual generation frameworks fail to take into
account the semantic content of the proposed edits, while relying heavily on
training to guide the generation process. We propose a novel, plug-and-play
black-box counterfactual generation framework, which suggests step-by-step
edits based on theoretical guarantees of optimal edits to produce human-level
counterfactual explanations with zero training. Our framework utilizes a
pre-trained image editing diffusion model, and operates without access to the
internals of the classifier, leading to an explainable counterfactual
generation process. Throughout our experimentation, we showcase the explanatory
gap between human reasoning and neural model behavior by utilizing both
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Vision Transformer (ViT) and Large Vision
Language Model (LVLM) classifiers, substantiated through a comprehensive human
evaluation.

Motivation: 深度生成模型在医学影像中具有重要应用价值，但存在记忆训练敏感数据的风险，需要可扩展的方法来检测训练数据泄露。

Method: DeepSSIM通过自监督学习将图像投影到嵌入空间，使嵌入间的余弦相似度与图像空间的SSIM分数匹配，并采用结构保持增强来捕获解剖特征。

Result: 在2195个脑部MRI扫描数据上的实验表明，DeepSSIM在检测记忆化方面优于现有方法，F1分数平均提升52.03%。

Conclusion: DeepSSIM是一种有效的记忆化检测工具，为医学影像生成模型的安全应用提供了重要保障。

Abstract: Deep generative models have emerged as a transformative tool in medical
imaging, offering substantial potential for synthetic data generation. However,
recent empirical studies highlight a critical vulnerability: these models can
memorize sensitive training data, posing significant risks of unauthorized
patient information disclosure. Detecting memorization in generative models
remains particularly challenging, necessitating scalable methods capable of
identifying training data leakage across large sets of generated samples. In
this work, we propose DeepSSIM, a novel self-supervised metric for quantifying
memorization in generative models. DeepSSIM is trained to: i) project images
into a learned embedding space and ii) force the cosine similarity between
embeddings to match the ground-truth SSIM (Structural Similarity Index) scores
computed in the image space. To capture domain-specific anatomical features,
training incorporates structure-preserving augmentations, allowing DeepSSIM to
estimate similarity reliably without requiring precise spatial alignment. We
evaluate DeepSSIM in a case study involving synthetic brain MRI data generated
by a Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) trained under memorization-prone conditions,
using 2,195 MRI scans from two publicly available datasets (IXI and CoRR).
Compared to state-of-the-art memorization metrics, DeepSSIM achieves superior
performance, improving F1 scores by an average of +52.03% over the best
existing method. Code and data of our approach are publicly available at the

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 稀疏感知模型采用查询驱动范式避免了密集BEV或体素构建，实现了高效计算和加速推理，但需要专门的预训练方法来提升其在自动驾驶任务中的性能。

Method: SQS引入插件模块在预训练期间从稀疏查询预测3D高斯表示，利用自监督溅射通过重建多视角图像和深度图学习细粒度上下文特征。在微调阶段，预训练的高斯查询通过查询交互机制与任务特定查询显式连接。

Result: 在自动驾驶基准测试中，SQS在多个基于查询的3D感知任务上带来显著性能提升，特别是在占用预测和3D物体检测方面，分别比现有最优预训练方法提升+1.3 mIoU和+1.0 NDS。

Conclusion: SQS为稀疏感知模型提供了一种有效的预训练框架，通过查询驱动的溅射预训练显著提升了3D感知任务的性能，证明了该方法在自动驾驶应用中的有效性。

Abstract: Sparse Perception Models (SPMs) adopt a query-driven paradigm that forgoes
explicit dense BEV or volumetric construction, enabling highly efficient
computation and accelerated inference. In this paper, we introduce SQS, a novel
query-based splatting pre-training specifically designed to advance SPMs in
autonomous driving. SQS introduces a plug-in module that predicts 3D Gaussian
representations from sparse queries during pre-training, leveraging
self-supervised splatting to learn fine-grained contextual features through the
reconstruction of multi-view images and depth maps. During fine-tuning, the
pre-trained Gaussian queries are seamlessly integrated into downstream networks
via query interaction mechanisms that explicitly connect pre-trained queries
with task-specific queries, effectively accommodating the diverse requirements
of occupancy prediction and 3D object detection. Extensive experiments on
autonomous driving benchmarks demonstrate that SQS delivers considerable
performance gains across multiple query-based 3D perception tasks, notably in
occupancy prediction and 3D object detection, outperforming prior
state-of-the-art pre-training approaches by a significant margin (i.e., +1.3
mIoU on occupancy prediction and +1.0 NDS on 3D detection).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的深度伪造检测模型主要针对单步伪造训练，而现实中的深度伪造往往是多种技术组合的多步伪造，这给检测带来了新的技术挑战。

Method: 提出了FakeChain基准测试，包含1步、2步和3步伪造，使用5种最先进的生成器进行合成，分析了不同步骤、生成器组合和质量设置下的检测性能和频谱特性。

Result: 检测性能高度依赖于最终伪造类型，当与训练分布不同时F1分数最多下降58.83%，表明检测器主要依赖最后阶段的伪造痕迹。

Conclusion: 检测模型需要明确考虑伪造历史和序列，FakeChain等基准测试对于反映现实世界中日益复杂的合成场景具有重要意义。

Abstract: Multi-step or hybrid deepfakes, created by sequentially applying different
deepfake creation methods such as Face-Swapping, GAN-based generation, and
Diffusion methods, can pose an emerging and unforseen technical challenge for
detection models trained on single-step forgeries. While prior studies have
mainly focused on detecting isolated single manipulation, little is known about
the detection model behavior under such compositional, hybrid, and complex
manipulation pipelines. In this work, we introduce \textbf{FakeChain}, a
large-scale benchmark comprising 1-, 2-, and 3-Step forgeries synthesized using
five state-of-the-art representative generators. Using this approach, we
analyze detection performance and spectral properties across hybrid
manipulation at different step, along with varying generator combinations and
quality settings. Surprisingly, our findings reveal that detection performance
highly depends on the final manipulation type, with F1-score dropping by up to
\textbf{58.83\%} when it differs from training distribution. This clearly
demonstrates that detectors rely on last-stage artifacts rather than cumulative
manipulation traces, limiting generalization. Such findings highlight the need
for detection models to explicitly consider manipulation history and sequences.
Our results highlight the importance of benchmarks such as FakeChain,
reflecting growing synthesis complexity and diversity in real-world scenarios.

Result: 在IC9600数据集上优于现有方法，在无参考图像质量评估基准上保持竞争力

Conclusion: 多模态融合在复杂度相关任务中具有有效性和高效性，D2S在训练时使用多模态信息但推理时仅需视觉分支，避免了多模态计算开销

Abstract: Accurately assessing image complexity (IC) is critical for computer vision,
yet most existing methods rely solely on visual features and often neglect
high-level semantic information, limiting their accuracy and generalization. We
introduce vision-text fusion for IC modeling. This approach integrates visual
and textual semantic features, increasing representational diversity. It also
reduces the complexity of the hypothesis space, which enhances both accuracy
and generalization in complexity assessment. We propose the D2S
(Describe-to-Score) framework, which generates image captions with a
pre-trained vision-language model. We propose the feature alignment and entropy
distribution alignment mechanisms, D2S guides semantic information to inform
complexity assessment while bridging the gap between vision and text
modalities. D2S utilizes multi-modal information during training but requires
only the vision branch during inference, thereby avoiding multi-modal
computational overhead and enabling efficient assessment. Experimental results
demonstrate that D2S outperforms existing methods on the IC9600 dataset and
maintains competitiveness on no-reference image quality assessment (NR-IQA)
benchmark, validating the effectiveness and efficiency of multi-modal fusion in
complexity-related tasks. Code is available at:

Abstract: As urbanization and climate change progress, urban heat island effects are
becoming more frequent and severe. To formulate effective mitigation plans,
cities require detailed air temperature data. However, predictive analytics
methods based on conventional machine learning models and limited data
infrastructure often provide inaccurate predictions, especially in underserved
areas. In this context, geospatial foundation models trained on unstructured
global data demonstrate strong generalization and require minimal fine-tuning,
offering an alternative for predictions where traditional approaches are
limited. This study fine-tunes a geospatial foundation model to predict urban
land surface temperatures under future climate scenarios and explores its
response to land cover changes using simulated vegetation strategies. The
fine-tuned model achieved pixel-wise downscaling errors below 1.74 {\deg}C and
aligned with ground truth patterns, demonstrating an extrapolation capacity up
to 3.62 {\deg}C.

Conclusion: Surgical-MambaLLM通过结合Mamba2和LLM，有效解决了手术视觉问答定位中的跨模态依赖和空间感知问题。

Abstract: In recent years, Visual Question Localized-Answering in robotic surgery
(Surgical-VQLA) has gained significant attention for its potential to assist
medical students and junior doctors in understanding surgical scenes. Recently,
the rapid development of Large Language Models (LLMs) has provided more
promising solutions for this task. However, current methods struggle to
establish complex dependencies between text and visual details, and have
difficulty perceiving the spatial information of surgical scenes. To address
these challenges, we propose a novel method, Surgical-MambaLLM, which is the
first to combine Mamba2 with LLM in the surgical domain, that leverages
Mamba2's ability to effectively capture cross-modal dependencies and perceive
spatial information in surgical scenes, thereby enhancing the LLMs'
understanding of surgical images. Specifically, we propose the Cross-modal
Bidirectional Mamba2 Integration (CBMI) module to leverage Mamba2 for effective
multimodal fusion, with its cross-modal integration capabilities. Additionally,
tailored to the geometric characteristics of surgical scenes, we design the
Surgical Instrument Perception (SIP) scanning mode for Mamba2 to scan the
surgical images, enhancing the model's spatial understanding of the surgical
scene. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our Surgical-MambaLLM model
outperforms the state-of-the-art methods on the EndoVis17-VQLA and

Abstract: Skeleton-based gait emotion recognition has received significant attention
due to its wide-ranging applications. However, existing methods primarily focus
on extracting spatial and local temporal motion information, failing to capture
long-range temporal representations. In this paper, we propose
\textbf{CGTGait}, a novel framework that collaboratively integrates graph

Additionally, we introduce a Bidirectional Cross-Stream Fusion (BCSF) module to
effectively aggregate posture and motion spatiotemporal features, facilitating
the exchange of complementary information between the two streams. We evaluate
our method on two widely used datasets, Emotion-Gait and ELMD, demonstrating

effectiveness in a variety of educational contexts. Additionally, to further
demonstrate the effectiveness of this technique on lowresource languages, we
developed HiSciVQA, a dataset comprising 2,245 high-quality, hand-annotated

low-resource language Q&A datasets and serves as a foundation for testing
VCASFT. Additionally, we introduce a novel LLM-based evaluation scheme to

Abstract: We present Follow-Your-Emoji-Faster, an efficient diffusion-based framework
for freestyle portrait animation driven by facial landmarks. The main
challenges in this task are preserving the identity of the reference portrait,
accurately transferring target expressions, and maintaining long-term temporal
consistency while ensuring generation efficiency. To address identity
preservation and accurate expression retargeting, we enhance Stable Diffusion
with two key components: a expression-aware landmarks as explicit motion
signals, which improve motion alignment, support exaggerated expressions, and
reduce identity leakage; and a fine-grained facial loss that leverages both
expression and facial masks to better capture subtle expressions and faithfully
preserve the reference appearance. With these components, our model supports
controllable and expressive animation across diverse portrait types, including
real faces, cartoons, sculptures, and animals. However, diffusion-based
frameworks typically struggle to efficiently generate long-term stable
animation results, which remains a core challenge in this task. To address
this, we propose a progressive generation strategy for stable long-term
animation, and introduce a Taylor-interpolated cache, achieving a 2.6X lossless
acceleration. These two strategies ensure that our method produces high-quality
results efficiently, making it user-friendly and accessible. Finally, we
introduce EmojiBench++, a more comprehensive benchmark comprising diverse

*Weiran Chen,Guiqian Zhu,Ying Li,Yi Ji,Chunping Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DA-Font是一种新颖的少样本字体生成框架，通过双注意力混合模块解决现有方法存在的笔画错误、伪影和模糊等问题，在多种字体风格和字符上优于现有最先进方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 少样本字体生成旨在用少量字形参考创建新字体，显著降低人工字体设计成本。但由于字体风格的多样性和复杂性，现有方法生成的结果常存在可见缺陷。

Method: 提出DA-Font框架，集成双注意力混合模块（DAHM），包含组件注意力块和关系注意力块，分别利用内容图像的组件信息指导风格迁移过程，并通过与原始和风格化组件表示交互来细化空间关系。还设计了角点一致性损失和弹性网格特征损失来改善几何对齐。

Result: 大量实验表明，DA-Font在多样字体风格和字符上优于现有最先进方法，在保持结构完整性和局部保真度方面表现出色。

Conclusion: DA-Font通过双注意力机制和几何对齐损失有效提升了少样本字体生成的质量，为字体设计提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Few-shot font generation aims to create new fonts with a limited number of
glyph references. It can be used to significantly reduce the labor cost of
manual font design. However, due to the variety and complexity of font styles,
the results generated by existing methods often suffer from visible defects,
such as stroke errors, artifacts and blurriness. To address these issues, we
propose DA-Font, a novel framework which integrates a Dual-Attention Hybrid
Module (DAHM). Specifically, we introduce two synergistic attention blocks: the
component attention block that leverages component information from content
images to guide the style transfer process, and the relation attention block
that further refines spatial relationships through interacting the content
feature with both original and stylized component-wise representations. These
two blocks collaborate to preserve accurate character shapes and stylistic
textures. Moreover, we also design a corner consistency loss and an elastic
mesh feature loss to better improve geometric alignment. Extensive experiments
show that our DA-Font outperforms the state-of-the-art methods across diverse
font styles and characters, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing
structural integrity and local fidelity. The source code can be found at

*Abhirama Subramanyam Penamakuri,Navlika Singh,Piyush Arora,Anand Mishra*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出MPA框架，通过无标签图像和从大型视觉语言模型的知识迁移来系统提升小型视觉语言模型的性能，减少性能差距同时保持计算效率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型计算成本高，不适用于资源受限场景；小型视觉语言模型效率高但性能差距显著

Method: 采用基于对等的策略方法，精确识别小型和大型模型之间的知识差异，并仅针对这些差异进行优化训练，而非依赖标注数据的传统知识蒸馏

Result: 在TextVQA、ST-VQA、ChartQA和OKVQA四个基准测试上，MPA一致提升了小型模型的性能，缩小了性能差距

Conclusion: MPA框架有效解决了小型视觉语言模型的性能瓶颈问题，为资源受限环境提供了实用解决方案

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (L-VLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
performance in various vision and language tasks, including visual question
answering (VQA). However, their high computational cost makes them impractical
for resource-constrained settings and inference-heavy applications. In
contrast, Small Vision-Language Models (S-VLMs) offer efficiency but suffer
from a significant performance gap compared to their larger counterparts. In
this work, we introduce the Model Parity Aligner (MPA), a novel framework
designed to systematically improve S-VLMs by leveraging unlabeled images and
effective knowledge transfer from L-VLMs. Instead of traditional knowledge
distillation methods that rely on labeled training data, MPA employs a
strategic parity-based approach that precisely identifies the knowledge
disparities between S-VLMs and L-VLMs, and optimizes training by targeting only
these disparities. We conduct extensive experiments on four diverse VQA
benchmarks, namely TextVQA, ST-VQA, ChartQA, and OKVQA, each of which requires
specialized reasoning capabilities such as text recognition, chart
interpretation, and commonsense and factual understanding. Our results
demonstrate that MPA consistently enhances the performance of S-VLMs on all
benchmarks, reducing the performance gap while maintaining computational
efficiency. We make our code publicly available.

TL;DR: 本文提出了Anytime Person Re-identification (AT-ReID)任务，旨在解决现有ReID方法在时间跨度上的局限性，并构建了首个大规模数据集AT-USTC，提出了统一模型Uni-AT来应对多场景检索挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有ReID任务和数据集受限于特定时间场景，无法满足实际应用中需要全天候、长时期检索目标人物的需求。

Method: 收集AT-USTC数据集（403k图像，21个月跨度），提出Uni-AT模型，包含多场景ReID框架、属性专家混合模块和分层动态加权策略。

Result: 实验表明该模型在所有场景下都取得了满意结果并展现出优秀的泛化能力。

Conclusion: AT-ReID任务具有重要研究价值，提出的数据集和模型为解决全天候人员重识别问题提供了有效方案。

Abstract: In real applications, person re-identification (ReID) is expected to retrieve
the target person at any time, including both daytime and nighttime, ranging
from short-term to long-term. However, existing ReID tasks and datasets can not
meet this requirement, as they are constrained by available time and only
provide training and evaluation for specific scenarios. Therefore, we
investigate a new task called Anytime Person Re-identification (AT-ReID), which
aims to achieve effective retrieval in multiple scenarios based on variations
in time. To address the AT-ReID problem, we collect the first large-scale
dataset, AT-USTC, which contains 403k images of individuals wearing multiple
clothes captured by RGB and IR cameras. Our data collection spans 21 months,
and 270 volunteers were photographed on average 29.1 times across different
dates or scenes, 4-15 times more than current datasets, providing conditions
for follow-up investigations in AT-ReID. Further, to tackle the new challenge
of multi-scenario retrieval, we propose a unified model named Uni-AT, which
comprises a multi-scenario ReID (MS-ReID) framework for scenario-specific
features learning, a Mixture-of-Attribute-Experts (MoAE) module to alleviate
inter-scenario interference, and a Hierarchical Dynamic Weighting (HDW)
strategy to ensure balanced training across all scenarios. Extensive
experiments show that our model leads to satisfactory results and exhibits
excellent generalization to all scenarios.

Motivation: 现有研究主要关注新颖的结构设计，但传统的点云处理架构（通过顺序采样、分组和特征提取层处理原始点）存在未充分利用的潜力。研究发现通过策略性的模块集成而非结构修改可以获得显著的性能提升。

Method: 提出了GF-Core模块，这是一个轻量级的可分离组件，同时调节分组层和特征提取层以实现更精细的特征聚合。此外，还引入了专门为点云输入设计的自监督预训练策略。

Result: 在ModelNet40数据集上，该方法将基线网络的准确率提升至94.0%，达到了先进框架的性能水平同时保持了架构简洁性。在ScanObjectNN数据集的三个变体上分别获得了2.96%、6.34%和6.32%的提升。

Conclusion: 通过模块集成策略而非结构修改，可以有效提升点云分析性能，证明了传统点云处理架构的潜力尚未被充分利用。

Abstract: Point cloud analysis has evolved with diverse network architectures, while
existing works predominantly focus on introducing novel structural designs.
However, conventional point-based architectures - processing raw points through
sequential sampling, grouping, and feature extraction layers - demonstrate
underutilized potential. We notice that substantial performance gains can be
unlocked through strategic module integration rather than structural
modifications. In this paper, we propose the Grouping-Feature Coordination
Module (GF-Core), a lightweight separable component that simultaneously
regulates both grouping layer and feature extraction layer to enable more
nuanced feature aggregation. Besides, we introduce a self-supervised
pretraining strategy specifically tailored for point-based inputs to enhance
model robustness in complex point cloud analysis scenarios. On ModelNet40
dataset, our method elevates baseline networks to 94.0% accuracy, matching
advanced frameworks' performance while preserving architectural simplicity. On
three variants of the ScanObjectNN dataset, we obtain improvements of 2.96%,
6.34%, and 6.32% respectively.

Motivation: 现有对抗攻击要么依赖不切实际的强假设（需要完整了解受害VLM），要么因破坏过多语义信息导致感知与任务上下文不一致，无法有效影响物理世界中的智能体行为

Method: 设计了ADVEDM框架及其两个变体：ADVEDM-R（从图像中移除特定对象语义）和ADVEDM-A（向图像中添加新对象语义），通过细粒度控制保持大部分区域语义完整性

Result: 在通用场景和具身决策任务中的实验结果表明，该方法具有细粒度控制能力和优秀的攻击性能

Conclusion: ADVEDM框架能够有效减少与任务上下文的冲突，使VLM输出有效但错误的决策，对物理世界中的智能体构成更实质性的安全威胁

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs), with their strong reasoning and planning
capabilities, are widely used in embodied decision-making (EDM) tasks in
embodied agents, such as autonomous driving and robotic manipulation. Recent
research has increasingly explored adversarial attacks on VLMs to reveal their
vulnerabilities. However, these attacks either rely on overly strong
assumptions, requiring full knowledge of the victim VLM, which is impractical
for attacking VLM-based agents, or exhibit limited effectiveness. The latter
stems from disrupting most semantic information in the image, which leads to a
misalignment between the perception and the task context defined by system
prompts. This inconsistency interrupts the VLM's reasoning process, resulting
in invalid outputs that fail to affect interactions in the physical world. To
this end, we propose a fine-grained adversarial attack framework, ADVEDM, which
modifies the VLM's perception of only a few key objects while preserving the
semantics of the remaining regions. This attack effectively reduces conflicts
with the task context, making VLMs output valid but incorrect decisions and
affecting the actions of agents, thus posing a more substantial safety threat
in the physical world. We design two variants of based on this framework,
ADVEDM-R and ADVEDM-A, which respectively remove the semantics of a specific
object from the image and add the semantics of a new object into the image. The
experimental results in both general scenarios and EDM tasks demonstrate
fine-grained control and excellent attack performance.

TL;DR: 本文系统评估了视觉语言模型在道路拓扑理解方面的能力，发现当前模型在空间推理方面存在显著瓶颈，特别是在时间性问题上表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然视觉语言模型在多模态推理方面取得了显著进展，但在自动驾驶领域的应用仍然有限，特别是对道路拓扑的理解能力尚未得到充分研究。

Method: 将多视角图像投影到统一的平面坐标系中，融合成鸟瞰图车道，并基于此设计了四个拓扑相关的诊断性视觉问答任务。

Result: 前沿闭源模型在某些任务中准确率较高，但在时间性问题上的表现较差（如GPT-4o在二分类问题上仅达到67.8%）。开源模型表现更差，即使30B规模的模型也面临困难。

Conclusion: 空间推理是当前视觉语言模型的基本瓶颈，模型能力与模型规模、推理标记长度和示例数量呈正相关，为未来研究指明了方向。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have recently shown remarkable progress in
multimodal reasoning, yet their applications in autonomous driving remain
limited. In particular, the ability to understand road topology, a key
requirement for safe navigation, has received relatively little attention.
While some recent works have begun to explore VLMs in driving contexts, their
performance on topology reasoning is far from satisfactory. In this work, we
systematically evaluate VLMs' capabilities in road topology understanding.
Specifically, multi-view images are projected into unified ground-plane
coordinate system and fused into bird's-eye-view (BEV) lanes. Based on these
BEV lanes, we formulate four topology-related diagnostic VQA tasks, which
together capture essential components of spatial topology reasoning. Through
extensive evaluation, we find that while frontier closed-source models (e.g.,
GPT-4o) achieve relatively high accuracy in some tasks, they still fail in some
temporal questions that humans can answer (e.g., GPT-4o achieve only 67.8% in
vector, a two-class classification problem). Furthermore, we find open-source
VLMs, even at 30B scale, struggle significantly. These results indicate that
spatial reasoning remains a fundamental bottleneck for current VLMs. We also
find that the model's capability is positively correlated with model size,
length of reasoning tokens and shots provided as examples, showing direction
for future research.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了MedCutMix，一种新颖的多模态疾病中心数据增强方法，通过诊断句子CutMix和跨模态注意力机制来增强医学视觉语言预训练的性能和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言预训练(VLP)依赖图像-文本数据集，但医学数据存在隐私问题和标注成本高的挑战。现有数据增强方法难以捕捉医学数据的复杂变化。

Method: MedCutMix在医学报告中执行诊断句子CutMix，并建立诊断句子与医学图像之间的跨注意力机制，指导图像模态中的注意力流形混合。

Result: 在四个下游放射学诊断数据集上超越了先前的方法，证明了其在增强放射学VLP性能和泛化能力方面的有效性。

Conclusion: MedCutMix通过疾病中心的多模态数据增强策略，成功解决了医学VLP中的数据稀缺问题，显著提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Vision-Language Pre-training (VLP) is drawing increasing interest for its
ability to minimize manual annotation requirements while enhancing semantic
understanding in downstream tasks. However, its reliance on image-text datasets
poses challenges due to privacy concerns and the high cost of obtaining paired
annotations. Data augmentation emerges as a viable strategy to address this
issue, yet existing methods often fall short of capturing the subtle and
complex variations in medical data due to limited diversity. To this end, we
propose MedCutMix, a novel multi-modal disease-centric data augmentation
method. MedCutMix performs diagnostic sentence CutMix within medical reports
and establishes the cross-attention between the diagnostic sentence and medical
image to guide attentive manifold mix within the imaging modality. Our approach
surpasses previous methods across four downstream radiology diagnosis datasets,
highlighting its effectiveness in enhancing performance and generalizability in
radiology VLP.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FitPro是一个用于开放世界交互式零样本文本行人检索的框架，通过特征对比解码、增量语义挖掘和查询感知分层检索三个创新组件，解决了模型泛化能力和语义理解不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文本行人检索方法在受限场景下取得了进展，但在开放世界交互检索中仍面临模型泛化能力有限和语义理解不足的挑战。

Method: FitPro包含三个核心组件：特征对比解码（FCD）用于生成高质量结构化行人描述，增量语义挖掘（ISM）用于构建全局语义表示，查询感知分层检索（QHR）用于动态优化检索流程。

Result: 在五个公共数据集和两种评估协议上的大量实验表明，FitPro显著克服了现有方法在交互检索中的泛化限制和语义建模约束。

Conclusion: FitPro为实际部署铺平了道路，代码和数据将在GitHub上发布。

Abstract: Text-based Pedestrian Retrieval (TPR) aims to retrieve specific target
pedestrians in visual scenes according to natural language descriptions.
Although existing methods have achieved progress under constrained settings,
interactive retrieval in the open-world scenario still suffers from limited
model generalization and insufficient semantic understanding. To address these
challenges, we propose FitPro, an open-world interactive zero-shot TPR
framework with enhanced semantic comprehension and cross-scene adaptability.
FitPro has three innovative components: Feature Contrastive Decoding (FCD),
Incremental Semantic Mining (ISM), and Query-aware Hierarchical Retrieval
(QHR). The FCD integrates prompt-guided contrastive decoding to generate
high-quality structured pedestrian descriptions from denoised images,
effectively alleviating semantic drift in zero-shot scenarios. The ISM
constructs holistic pedestrian representations from multi-view observations to
achieve global semantic modeling in multi-turn interactions,thereby improving
robustness against viewpoint shifts and fine-grained variations in
descriptions. The QHR dynamically optimizes the retrieval pipeline according to
query types, enabling efficient adaptation to multi-modal and multi-view
inputs. Extensive experiments on five public datasets and two evaluation
protocols demonstrate that FitPro significantly overcomes the generalization
limitations and semantic modeling constraints of existing methods in
interactive retrieval, paving the way for practical deployment. The code and
data will be released at https://github.com/

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于动作的视频对象分割依赖于大规模标注和提示，但这些标注成本高、不一致且容易受到多模态噪声的影响，如不精确的掩码和参考歧义。目前这一挑战尚未被探索。

Method: 引入两种标签噪声类型：文本提示噪声（类别翻转和类别内名词替换）和掩码标注噪声（扰动对象边界模拟不精确监督）。建立ActiSeg-NL基准，适配六种标签噪声学习策略，并提出并行掩码头机制（PMHM）处理掩码标注噪声。

Result: 定性评估揭示了特征性失败模式，包括边界泄漏和边界扰动下的定位错误，以及文本翻转下的身份替换。比较分析显示不同学习策略表现出不同的鲁棒性特征，受前景-背景权衡的支配。

Conclusion: 本文为基于动作的视频对象分割在标签噪声下的研究奠定了基础，提供了基准和分析框架，有助于理解噪声类型与失败模式之间的关系，并提出了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Embodied intelligence relies on accurately segmenting objects actively
involved in interactions. Action-based video object segmentation addresses this
by linking segmentation with action semantics, but it depends on large-scale
annotations and prompts that are costly, inconsistent, and prone to multimodal
noise such as imprecise masks and referential ambiguity. To date, this
challenge remains unexplored. In this work, we take the first step by studying
action-based video object segmentation under label noise, focusing on two
sources: textual prompt noise (category flips and within-category noun
substitutions) and mask annotation noise (perturbed object boundaries to mimic
imprecise supervision). Our contributions are threefold. First, we introduce
two types of label noises for the action-based video object segmentation task.
Second, we build up the first action-based video object segmentation under a
label noise benchmark ActiSeg-NL and adapt six label-noise learning strategies
to this setting, and establish protocols for evaluating them under textual,
boundary, and mixed noise. Third, we provide a comprehensive analysis linking
noise types to failure modes and robustness gains, and we introduce a Parallel
Mask Head Mechanism (PMHM) to address mask annotation noise. Qualitative
evaluations further reveal characteristic failure modes, including boundary
leakage and mislocalization under boundary perturbations, as well as occasional
identity substitutions under textual flips. Our comparative analysis reveals
that different learning strategies exhibit distinct robustness profiles,
governed by a foreground-background trade-off where some achieve balanced
performance while others prioritize foreground accuracy at the cost of
background precision. The established benchmark and source code will be made
publicly available at https://github.com/mylwx/ActiSeg-NL.

Motivation: 数据增强虽然能提升深度学习模型的泛化性能，但会引入分布偏移和噪声，限制了深度网络的潜力并降低了性能。

Method: 提出IPF-RDA框架，包含：(i)类判别信息估计算法，识别对数据增强操作最敏感的点及其重要性分数；(ii)信息保留方案，自适应地保留增强样本中的关键信息并确保数据多样性。将数据增强方法分为三类并集成到框架中。

Conclusion: IPF-RDA虽然简单，但能有效增强数据增强方法的鲁棒性，充分发挥其潜力，具有良好的性能和可扩展性。

Abstract: Data augmentation is widely utilized as an effective technique to enhance the
generalization performance of deep models. However, data augmentation may
inevitably introduce distribution shifts and noises, which significantly
constrain the potential and deteriorate the performance of deep networks. To
this end, we propose a novel information-preserving framework, namely IPF-RDA,
to enhance the robustness of data augmentations in this paper. IPF-RDA combines
the proposal of (i) a new class-discriminative information estimation algorithm
that identifies the points most vulnerable to data augmentation operations and
corresponding importance scores; And (ii) a new information-preserving scheme
that preserves the critical information in the augmented samples and ensures
the diversity of augmented data adaptively. We divide data augmentation methods
into three categories according to the operation types and integrate these
approaches into our framework accordingly. After being integrated into our
framework, the robustness of data augmentation methods can be enhanced and
their full potential can be unleashed. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
although being simple, IPF-RDA consistently improves the performance of
numerous commonly used state-of-the-art data augmentation methods with popular
deep models on a variety of datasets, including CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100,
Tiny-ImageNet, CUHK03, Market1501, Oxford Flower, and MNIST, where its

Conclusion: ProtoVQA推动了透明和可信赖VQA系统的发展，为安全关键应用提供了可靠的可解释解决方案。

Abstract: Visual Question Answering (VQA) is increasingly used in diverse applications
ranging from general visual reasoning to safety-critical domains such as
medical imaging and autonomous systems, where models must provide not only
accurate answers but also explanations that humans can easily understand and
verify. Prototype-based modeling has shown promise for interpretability by
grounding predictions in semantically meaningful regions for purely visual
reasoning tasks, yet remains underexplored in the context of VQA. We present
ProtoVQA, a unified prototypical framework that (i) learns question-aware
prototypes that serve as reasoning anchors, connecting answers to
discriminative image regions, (ii) applies spatially constrained matching to
ensure that the selected evidence is coherent and semantically relevant, and
(iii) supports both answering and grounding tasks through a shared prototype
backbone. To assess explanation quality, we propose the Visual-Linguistic
Alignment Score (VLAS), which measures how well the model's attended regions
align with ground-truth evidence. Experiments on Visual7W show that ProtoVQA
yields faithful, fine-grained explanations while maintaining competitive
accuracy, advancing the development of transparent and trustworthy VQA systems.

Motivation: 现有方法主要关注输入视角的准确预测，忽视了选择最佳视角来全面感知场景中所有人群的问题。现有视角选择方法需要大量标注视角和图像，缺乏跨场景能力，限制了应用场景。

Method: 首先提出独立视角选择方法（IVS），考虑视角和场景几何信息；然后提出主动视角选择方法（AVS），联合优化视角选择、标注和下游任务，在视角选择过程中同时考虑几何信息和下游任务模型的预测。

Conclusion: 提出的主动视角选择方法有效解决了多视角人群分析中的视角选择问题，在减少标注需求的同时提升了跨场景性能。

Abstract: Multi-view crowd counting and localization fuse the input multi-views for
estimating the crowd number or locations on the ground. Existing methods mainly
focus on accurately predicting on the crowd shown in the input views, which
neglects the problem of choosing the `best' camera views to perceive all crowds
well in the scene. Besides, existing view selection methods require massive
labeled views and images, and lack the ability for cross-scene settings,
reducing their application scenarios. Thus, in this paper, we study the view
selection issue for better scene-level multi-view crowd counting and
localization results with cross-scene ability and limited label demand, instead
of input-view-level results. We first propose an independent view selection
method (IVS) that considers view and scene geometries in the view selection
strategy and conducts the view selection, labeling, and downstream tasks
independently. Based on IVS, we also put forward an active view selection
method (AVS) that jointly optimizes the view selection, labeling, and
downstream tasks. In AVS, we actively select the labeled views and consider
both the view/scene geometries and the predictions of the downstream task
models in the view selection process. Experiments on multi-view counting and
localization tasks demonstrate the cross-scene and the limited label demand
advantages of the proposed active view selection method (AVS), outperforming
existing methods and with wider application scenarios.

*Xiaodong Wang,Zijun He,Ping Wang,Lishun Wang,Yanan Hu,Xin Yuan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种色度-强度分解框架CIDNet，用于解决编码孔径快照光谱成像(CASSI)中的HSI重建问题，通过分离光照不变的色度信息和光照相关的强度信息，实现更好的光谱重建效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CASSI系统捕获的测量值混合了空间和光谱信息，且受场景光照影响，难以恢复光照不变的本征光谱反射率。

Method: 提出色度-强度分解框架，将HSI分解为空间平滑的强度图和光谱变化的色度立方体；开发CIDNet网络，包含混合空间-光谱Transformer和退化感知的空间自适应噪声估计模块。

Result: 在合成和真实CASSI数据集上的实验表明，该方法在光谱和色度保真度方面均取得优越性能。

Conclusion: 色度-强度分解方法能有效解决CASSI中的HSI重建问题，特别是对光照不变的光谱反射率恢复效果显著。

Abstract: In coded aperture snapshot spectral imaging (CASSI), the captured measurement
entangles spatial and spectral information, posing a severely ill-posed inverse
problem for hyperspectral images (HSIs) reconstruction. Moreover, the captured
radiance inherently depends on scene illumination, making it difficult to
recover the intrinsic spectral reflectance that remains invariant to lighting
conditions. To address these challenges, we propose a chromaticity-intensity
decomposition framework, which disentangles an HSI into a spatially smooth
intensity map and a spectrally variant chromaticity cube. The chromaticity
encodes lighting-invariant reflectance, enriched with high-frequency spatial
details and local spectral sparsity. Building on this decomposition, we develop
CIDNet, a Chromaticity-Intensity Decomposition unfolding network within a
dual-camera CASSI system. CIDNet integrates a hybrid spatial-spectral
Transformer tailored to reconstruct fine-grained and sparse spectral
chromaticity and a degradation-aware, spatially-adaptive noise estimation
module that captures anisotropic noise across iterative stages. Extensive
experiments on both synthetic and real-world CASSI datasets demonstrate that
our method achieves superior performance in both spectral and chromaticity
fidelity. Code and models will be publicly available.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前布局到图像生成方法性能仍不理想，需要更精确的位置控制和多模态内容控制能力。

Method: 基于DiT的T2I模型，通过轻量级LoRA模块实现实例组装注意力机制，支持边界框位置控制和文本/视觉内容控制。

Result: 在复杂布局条件下达到最先进性能，与多种风格LoRA模块兼容性好。

Conclusion: InstanceAssemble方法有效提升了布局到图像生成的准确性和可控性，为精确图像合成提供了新思路。

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in generating
high-quality images. Recent advancements in Layout-to-Image (L2I) generation
have leveraged positional conditions and textual descriptions to facilitate
precise and controllable image synthesis. Despite overall progress, current L2I
methods still exhibit suboptimal performance. Therefore, we propose
InstanceAssemble, a novel architecture that incorporates layout conditions via
instance-assembling attention, enabling position control with bounding boxes
(bbox) and multimodal content control including texts and additional visual
content. Our method achieves flexible adaption to existing DiT-based T2I models
through light-weighted LoRA modules. Additionally, we propose a Layout-to-Image
benchmark, Denselayout, a comprehensive benchmark for layout-to-image
generation, containing 5k images with 90k instances in total. We further
introduce Layout Grounding Score (LGS), an interpretable evaluation metric to
more precisely assess the accuracy of L2I generation. Experiments demonstrate
that our InstanceAssemble method achieves state-of-the-art performance under
complex layout conditions, while exhibiting strong compatibility with diverse
style LoRA modules.

AnimalBooth, a framework that strengthens identity preservation with an Animal
Net and an adaptive attention module, mitigating cross domain alignment errors.
We further introduce a frequency controlled feature integration module that

that AnimalBooth consistently outperforms strong baselines on multiple
benchmarks and improves both identity fidelity and perceptual quality.

### [57] [When Confidence Fails: Revisiting Pseudo-Label Selection in Semi-supervised Semantic Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16704)
*Pan Liu,Jinshi Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为置信度可分离学习（CSL）的新方法，用于解决半监督语义分割中伪标签选择的问题。该方法通过凸优化建立样本特定的决策边界，并引入随机掩码机制来改善模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法使用固定置信度阈值来选择伪标签，但无法应对网络过度自信的问题，即正确和错误预测在高置信度区域重叠严重。同时，直接丢弃低置信度预测会破坏空间语义连续性，导致关键上下文信息丢失。

Method: CSL将伪标签选择建模为置信度分布特征空间中的凸优化问题，建立样本特定的决策边界来区分可靠和不可靠预测。此外，引入可靠像素的随机掩码，引导网络从低可靠性区域学习上下文关系。

Result: 在Pascal、Cityscapes和COCO基准测试上的广泛实验结果表明，CSL在性能上优于现有的最先进方法。

Conclusion: CSL通过优化伪标签选择策略，有效解决了半监督语义分割中的置信度分离问题，提高了模型的性能和鲁棒性。

Abstract: While significant advances exist in pseudo-label generation for
semi-supervised semantic segmentation, pseudo-label selection remains
understudied. Existing methods typically use fixed confidence thresholds to
retain high-confidence predictions as pseudo-labels. However, these methods
cannot cope with network overconfidence tendency, where correct and incorrect
predictions overlap significantly in high-confidence regions, making separation
challenging and amplifying model cognitive bias. Meanwhile, the direct
discarding of low-confidence predictions disrupts spatial-semantic continuity,
causing critical context loss. We propose Confidence Separable Learning (CSL)
to address these limitations. CSL formulates pseudo-label selection as a convex
optimization problem within the confidence distribution feature space,
establishing sample-specific decision boundaries to distinguish reliable from
unreliable predictions. Additionally, CSL introduces random masking of reliable
pixels to guide the network in learning contextual relationships from
low-reliability regions, thereby mitigating the adverse effects of discarding
uncertain predictions. Extensive experimental results on the Pascal,
Cityscapes, and COCO benchmarks show that CSL performs favorably against
state-of-the-art methods. Code and model weights are available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Text-Scene是一个自动将3D场景解析为文本描述以进行场景理解的框架，通过几何分析和多模态大语言模型生成准确、详细且人类可解释的描述，并提出了InPlan3D基准来评估3D任务规划能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多模态大语言模型在3D场景理解中的挑战：3D环境涉及更丰富的概念（空间关系、功能、物理、布局等），且缺乏大规模3D视觉语言数据集。

Method: 给定3D场景，模型识别物体属性和空间关系，然后生成整个场景的连贯摘要，结合几何分析和MLLMs，无需人工干预。

Result: 实验结果表明，文本解析能够忠实表示3D场景并有益于下游任务。提出了包含3174个长期规划任务的InPlan3D基准。

Conclusion: Text-Scene通过语言使3D场景内容可理解，强调方法的清晰性和可访问性，代码和数据集将发布。

Abstract: Enabling agents to understand and interact with complex 3D scenes is a
fundamental challenge for embodied artificial intelligence systems. While
Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved significant progress in
2D image understanding, extending such capabilities to 3D scenes remains
difficult: 1) 3D environment involves richer concepts such as spatial
relationships, affordances, physics, layout, and so on, 2) the absence of
large-scale 3D vision-language datasets has posed a significant obstacle. In
this paper, we introduce Text-Scene, a framework that automatically parses 3D
scenes into textual descriptions for scene understanding. Given a 3D scene, our
model identifies object attributes and spatial relationships, and then
generates a coherent summary of the whole scene, bridging the gap between 3D
observation and language without requiring human-in-the-loop intervention. By
leveraging both geometric analysis and MLLMs, Text-Scene produces descriptions
that are accurate, detailed, and human-interpretable, capturing object-level
details and global-level context. Experimental results on benchmarks
demonstrate that our textual parses can faithfully represent 3D scenes and
benefit downstream tasks. To evaluate the reasoning capability of MLLMs, we
present InPlan3D, a comprehensive benchmark for 3D task planning, consisting of
3174 long-term planning tasks across 636 indoor scenes. We emphasize clarity
and accessibility in our approach, aiming to make 3D scene content
understandable through language. Code and datasets will be released.

TL;DR: 本文提出了3DPain合成数据集和ViTPain框架，用于解决自动疼痛评估中的数据集不平衡和生成模型控制精度不足的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动疼痛评估对非交流患者（如痴呆症患者）至关重要，但现有数据集存在严重的人口统计和标签不平衡问题，且当前生成模型无法精确控制面部动作单元、面部结构或临床验证的疼痛水平。

Method: 采用三阶段框架：生成多样化3D网格，使用扩散模型进行纹理处理，应用AU驱动的面部绑定技术合成多视角面部图像。同时提出ViTPain框架，通过热图训练的教师模型指导RGB图像训练的学生模型进行跨模态知识蒸馏。

Result: 创建了包含82,500个样本的大规模合成数据集，涵盖25,000个疼痛表情热图和2,500个合成身份，在年龄、性别和种族方面保持平衡。ViTPain框架提高了准确性、可解释性和临床可靠性。

Conclusion: 3DPain和ViTPain共同为通用自动疼痛评估建立了一个可控、多样化且基于临床的基础。

Abstract: Automated pain assessment from facial expressions is crucial for
non-communicative patients, such as those with dementia. Progress has been
limited by two challenges: (i) existing datasets exhibit severe demographic and
label imbalance due to ethical constraints, and (ii) current generative models
cannot precisely control facial action units (AUs), facial structure, or
clinically validated pain levels.
  We present 3DPain, a large-scale synthetic dataset specifically designed for
automated pain assessment, featuring unprecedented annotation richness and
demographic diversity. Our three-stage framework generates diverse 3D meshes,
textures them with diffusion models, and applies AU-driven face rigging to
synthesize multi-view faces with paired neutral and pain images, AU
configurations, PSPI scores, and the first dataset-level annotations of
pain-region heatmaps. The dataset comprises 82,500 samples across 25,000 pain
expression heatmaps and 2,500 synthetic identities balanced by age, gender, and
ethnicity.
  We further introduce ViTPain, a Vision Transformer based cross-modal
distillation framework in which a heatmap-trained teacher guides a student
trained on RGB images, enhancing accuracy, interpretability, and clinical
reliability. Together, 3DPain and ViTPain establish a controllable, diverse,
and clinically grounded foundation for generalizable automated pain assessment.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种名为Min的方法，通过学习有益噪声来缓解类增量学习中预训练模型参数漂移的问题，在多个基准数据集上取得了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 类增量学习中，对预训练模型进行轻量级微调会导致参数漂移，损害模型的泛化能力。参数漂移可以被视为一种噪声，但研究表明噪声并不总是有害的，适当的噪声可以抑制低相关性特征，为未来任务留出空间。

Method: 提出Min方法：1）从新任务的高维特征中学习任务特定噪声；2）动态调整权重以优化不同任务噪声的混合；3）将有益噪声嵌入中间特征以掩盖无效模式的响应。

Result: 在六个基准数据集上的广泛实验表明，Min在大多数增量设置中实现了最先进的性能，特别是在50步增量设置中表现尤为突出。

Conclusion: 研究表明有益噪声在持续学习中具有显著潜力，Min方法有效缓解了骨干网络泛化能力下降的问题。

Abstract: Class Incremental Learning (CIL) aims to continuously learn new categories
while retaining the knowledge of old ones. Pre-trained models (PTMs) show
promising capabilities in CIL. However, existing approaches that apply
lightweight fine-tuning to backbones still induce parameter drift, thereby
compromising the generalization capability of pre-trained models. Parameter
drift can be conceptualized as a form of noise that obscures critical patterns
learned for previous tasks. However, recent researches have shown that noise is
not always harmful. For example, the large number of visual patterns learned
from pre-training can be easily abused by a single task, and introducing
appropriate noise can suppress some low-correlation features, thus leaving a
margin for future tasks. To this end, we propose learning beneficial noise for
CIL guided by information theory and propose Mixture of Noise (Min), aiming to
mitigate the degradation of backbone generalization from adapting new tasks.
Specifically, task-specific noise is learned from high-dimension features of
new tasks. Then, a set of weights is adjusted dynamically for optimal mixture
of different task noise. Finally, Min embeds the beneficial noise into the
intermediate features to mask the response of inefficient patterns. Extensive
experiments on six benchmark datasets demonstrate that Min achieves
state-of-the-art performance in most incremental settings, with particularly
outstanding results in 50-steps incremental settings. This shows the
significant potential for beneficial noise in continual learning.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CAMBench-QR是一个结构感知的基准测试，利用QR码的几何结构来评估类激活映射(CAM)方法是否能在关注必要子结构的同时避免背景干扰。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的可视化解释方法往往在结构忠实性上存在问题，需要一种能够准确测试CAM方法是否真正关注图像结构特征的评估基准。

Method: 通过合成QR码/非QR码数据，使用精确掩码和受控失真，开发结构感知指标（Finder/Timing质量比、背景泄漏、覆盖AUC、结构距离等），并对代表性CAM方法进行零样本和微调测试。

Result: 建立了可复现的结构感知评估基准，为可视化解释的结构忠实性提供了简单可靠的测试标准。

Conclusion: CAMBench-QR可以作为判断可视化解释是否真正具有结构感知能力的试金石，为CAM方法的结构忠实性评估提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Visual explanations are often plausible but not structurally faithful. We
introduce CAMBench-QR, a structure-aware benchmark that leverages the canonical
geometry of QR codes (finder patterns, timing lines, module grid) to test
whether CAM methods place saliency on requisite substructures while avoiding
background. CAMBench-QR synthesizes QR/non-QR data with exact masks and
controlled distortions, and reports structure-aware metrics (Finder/Timing Mass
Ratios, Background Leakage, coverage AUCs, Distance-to-Structure) alongside
causal occlusion, insertion/deletion faithfulness, robustness, and latency. We
benchmark representative, efficient CAMs (LayerCAM, EigenGrad-CAM, XGrad-CAM)
under two practical regimes of zero-shot and last-block fine-tuning. The
benchmark, metrics, and training recipes provide a simple, reproducible
yardstick for structure-aware evaluation of visual explanations. Hence we
propose that CAMBENCH-QR can be used as a litmus test of whether visual
explanations are truly structure-aware.

Motivation: 传统三平面表示存在特征纠缠导致镜像伪影，球面三平面虽然缓解了特征纠缠但存在映射不均和特征利用率低的问题。两种方法都存在特征穿透问题，限制了其性能潜力。

Method: 提出混合平面表示，结合平面和球面坐标系的优点；采用近等面积扭曲策略替代传统theta-phi扭曲，最大化特征图利用率；生成器合成单通道统一特征图而非多通道分离特征图，消除特征穿透。

Result: HyPlaneHead方法在完整头部图像合成任务中实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 通过系统分析三平面表示的问题并提出创新解决方案，hy-plane表示能够充分发挥三平面方法的潜力，在3D感知GAN中取得了显著改进。

Abstract: Tri-plane-like representations have been widely adopted in 3D-aware GANs for
head image synthesis and other 3D object/scene modeling tasks due to their
efficiency. However, querying features via Cartesian coordinate projection
often leads to feature entanglement, which results in mirroring artifacts. A
recent work, SphereHead, attempted to address this issue by introducing
spherical tri-planes based on a spherical coordinate system. While it
successfully mitigates feature entanglement, SphereHead suffers from uneven
mapping between the square feature maps and the spherical planes, leading to
inefficient feature map utilization during rendering and difficulties in
generating fine image details. Moreover, both tri-plane and spherical tri-plane
representations share a subtle yet persistent issue: feature penetration across
convolutional channels can cause interference between planes, particularly when
one plane dominates the others. These challenges collectively prevent
tri-plane-based methods from reaching their full potential. In this paper, we
systematically analyze these problems for the first time and propose innovative
solutions to address them. Specifically, we introduce a novel hybrid-plane
(hy-plane for short) representation that combines the strengths of both planar
and spherical planes while avoiding their respective drawbacks. We further
enhance the spherical plane by replacing the conventional theta-phi warping
with a novel near-equal-area warping strategy, which maximizes the effective
utilization of the square feature map. In addition, our generator synthesizes a
single-channel unified feature map instead of multiple feature maps in separate
channels, thereby effectively eliminating feature penetration. With a series of
technical improvements, our hy-plane representation enables our method,
HyPlaneHead, to achieve state-of-the-art performance in full-head image
synthesis.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DiffEye是一个基于扩散模型的训练框架，用于生成连续且多样化的眼动轨迹，解决了现有方法无法捕捉人类视觉注意力多样性和丢弃原始轨迹信息的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有眼动预测模型通常使用离散的扫描路径，丢弃了原始轨迹的丰富信息，且无法捕捉不同观察者之间的变异性，通常只能生成固定长度的单一扫描路径。

Method: 基于扩散模型，引入对应位置嵌入(CPE)组件来对齐空间注视信息与视觉输入的基于补丁的语义特征，利用原始眼动轨迹而非扫描路径进行训练。

Result: DiffEye在扫描路径生成方面达到最先进性能，首次实现了连续眼动轨迹的生成，即使在相对较小的数据集上训练也能产生高质量、真实的眼动模式。

Conclusion: DiffEye是首个在自然图像上使用扩散模型并充分利用原始眼动数据丰富性的方法，生成的轨迹能更准确地反映人类视觉注意力的分布。

Abstract: Numerous models have been developed for scanpath and saliency prediction,
which are typically trained on scanpaths, which model eye movement as a
sequence of discrete fixation points connected by saccades, while the rich
information contained in the raw trajectories is often discarded. Moreover,
most existing approaches fail to capture the variability observed among human
subjects viewing the same image. They generally predict a single scanpath of
fixed, pre-defined length, which conflicts with the inherent diversity and
stochastic nature of real-world visual attention. To address these challenges,
we propose DiffEye, a diffusion-based training framework designed to model
continuous and diverse eye movement trajectories during free viewing of natural
images. Our method builds on a diffusion model conditioned on visual stimuli
and introduces a novel component, namely Corresponding Positional Embedding
(CPE), which aligns spatial gaze information with the patch-based semantic
features of the visual input. By leveraging raw eye-tracking trajectories
rather than relying on scanpaths, DiffEye captures the inherent variability in
human gaze behavior and generates high-quality, realistic eye movement
patterns, despite being trained on a comparatively small dataset. The generated
trajectories can also be converted into scanpaths and saliency maps, resulting
in outputs that more accurately reflect the distribution of human visual
attention. DiffEye is the first method to tackle this task on natural images
using a diffusion model while fully leveraging the richness of raw eye-tracking
data. Our extensive evaluation shows that DiffEye not only achieves
state-of-the-art performance in scanpath generation but also enables, for the
first time, the generation of continuous eye movement trajectories. Project

Conclusion: MMPart框架解决了现有部件感知3D生成方法的局限性，提供了更好的用户控制和结构理解能力，在VR/AR、元宇宙和机器人等领域具有应用价值。

Abstract: Generative 3D modeling has advanced rapidly, driven by applications in VR/AR,
metaverse, and robotics. However, most methods represent the target object as a
closed mesh devoid of any structural information, limiting editing, animation,
and semantic understanding. Part-aware 3D generation addresses this problem by
decomposing objects into meaningful components, but existing pipelines face
challenges: in existing methods, the user has no control over which objects are
separated and how model imagine the occluded parts in isolation phase. In this
paper, we introduce MMPart, an innovative framework for generating part-aware
3D models from a single image. We first use a VLM to generate a set of prompts
based on the input image and user descriptions. In the next step, a generative
model generates isolated images of each object based on the initial image and
the previous step's prompts as supervisor (which control the pose and guide
model how imagine previously occluded areas). Each of those images then enters
the multi-view generation stage, where a number of consistent images from
different views are generated. Finally, a reconstruction model converts each of
these multi-view images into a 3D model.

Abstract: With the rapid increase in the number of artificial satellites, astronomical
imaging is experiencing growing interference. When these satellites reflect
sunlight, they produce streak-like artifacts in photometry images. Such
satellite trails can introduce false sources and cause significant photometric
errors. As a result, accurately identifying the positions of satellite trails
in observational data has become essential. In this work, we propose a
satellite trail detection model that combines the U-Net deep neural network for
image segmentation with the Line Segment Detector (LSD) algorithm. The model is
trained on 375 simulated images of satellite trails, generated using data from
the Mini-SiTian Array. Experimental results show that for trails with a
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) greater than 3, the detection rate exceeds 99.
Additionally, when applied to real observational data from the Mini-SiTian
Array, the model achieves a recall of 79.57 and a precision of 74.56.

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have achieved strong performance on
vision-language tasks, particularly Visual Question Answering (VQA). While
prior work has explored unimodal biases in VQA, the problem of selection bias
in Multiple-Choice Question Answering (MCQA), where models may favor specific
option tokens (e.g., "A") or positions, remains underexplored. In this paper,
we investigate both the presence and nature of selection bias in LVLMs through
fine-grained MCQA benchmarks spanning easy, medium, and hard difficulty levels,
defined by the semantic similarity of the options. We further propose an
inference-time logit-level debiasing method that estimates an ensemble bias
vector from general and contextual prompts and applies confidence-adaptive
corrections to the model's output. Our method mitigates bias without retraining
and is compatible with frozen LVLMs. Extensive experiments across several
state-of-the-art models reveal consistent selection biases that intensify with
task difficulty, and show that our mitigation approach significantly reduces
bias while improving accuracy in challenging settings. This work offers new
insights into the limitations of LVLMs in MCQA and presents a practical
approach to improve their robustness in fine-grained visual reasoning. Datasets

TL;DR: MedGS是一个半监督神经隐式表面重建框架，采用基于高斯泼溅的插值机制，用于多模态3D医学成像数据的表面重建和帧间插值。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法在医学图像表面重建和帧间插值中面临图像噪声和帧间信息不完整的限制，需要更鲁棒和高效的解决方案。

Method: 将医学成像数据表示为嵌入3D空间的连续2D帧，使用基于高斯分布的建模方法，实现鲁棒的帧插值和高保真表面重建。

Result: MedGS相比传统神经隐式方法训练更高效，基于高斯泼溅的显式表示增强了噪声鲁棒性，支持灵活编辑和复杂解剖结构的精确建模。

Conclusion: MedGS框架非常适合医学成像中的可扩展和实际应用，能够减少伪影并提高建模精度。

Abstract: Multi-modal three-dimensional (3D) medical imaging data, derived from
ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and potentially computed
tomography (CT), provide a widely adopted approach for non-invasive anatomical
visualization. Accurate modeling, registration, and visualization in this
setting depend on surface reconstruction and frame-to-frame interpolation.
Traditional methods often face limitations due to image noise and incomplete
information between frames. To address these challenges, we present MedGS, a
semi-supervised neural implicit surface reconstruction framework that employs a
Gaussian Splatting (GS)-based interpolation mechanism. In this framework,
medical imaging data are represented as consecutive two-dimensional (2D) frames
embedded in 3D space and modeled using Gaussian-based distributions. This
representation enables robust frame interpolation and high-fidelity surface
reconstruction across imaging modalities. As a result, MedGS offers more
efficient training than traditional neural implicit methods. Its explicit
GS-based representation enhances noise robustness, allows flexible editing, and
supports precise modeling of complex anatomical structures with fewer
artifacts. These features make MedGS highly suitable for scalable and practical
applications in medical imaging.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出Mirror-CFE方法，直接在分类器特征空间中生成反事实解释，将决策边界视为镜像来反映特征表示，无需额外图像编码器和生成模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CFE方法依赖额外图像编码器和生成模型创建合理图像，忽略了分类器自身的特征空间和决策边界，无法解释分类器学习的内在特征空间和决策边界。

Method: Mirror-CFE在分类器特征空间中操作，将决策边界作为镜像，学习从特征空间到图像空间的映射函数，同时保持距离关系，实现源图像与其反事实之间的平滑过渡。

Result: 在四个图像数据集上的实验表明，Mirror-CFE在保持输入相似性的同时，在有效性方面优于最先进的解释方法。

Conclusion: Mirror-CFE通过生成逐步过渡提供分类器决策过程的可解释可视化，揭示特征如何随分类置信度变化而演化。

Abstract: Counterfactual explanations (CFE) for deep image classifiers aim to reveal
how minimal input changes lead to different model decisions, providing critical
insights for model interpretation and improvement. However, existing CFE
methods often rely on additional image encoders and generative models to create
plausible images, neglecting the classifier's own feature space and decision
boundaries. As such, they do not explain the intrinsic feature space and
decision boundaries learned by the classifier. To address this limitation, we
propose Mirror-CFE, a novel method that generates faithful counterfactual
explanations by operating directly in the classifier's feature space, treating
decision boundaries as mirrors that ``reflect'' feature representations in the
mirror. Mirror-CFE learns a mapping function from feature space to image space
while preserving distance relationships, enabling smooth transitions between
source images and their counterfactuals. Through extensive experiments on four
image datasets, we demonstrate that Mirror-CFE achieves superior performance in
validity while maintaining input resemblance compared to state-of-the-art
explanation methods. Finally, mirror-CFE provides interpretable visualization
of the classifier's decision process by generating step-wise transitions that
reveal how features evolve as classification confidence changes.

TL;DR: 提出L2M-Reg方法，一种考虑模型不确定性的基于平面的精细配准方法，用于LiDAR点云与语义3D城市模型在建筑级别的精确配准


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决LiDAR点云与语义3D城市模型在建筑级别配准的挑战，特别是在LoD2级别模型存在泛化不确定性的情况下，这是城市数字孪生和下游任务的基础

Method: L2M-Reg包含三个关键步骤：建立可靠的平面对应关系、构建伪平面约束的Gauss-Helmert模型、自适应估计垂直平移

Result: 在三个真实世界数据集上的实验表明，L2M-Reg比现有的基于ICP和基于平面的方法更准确且计算效率更高

Conclusion: L2M-Reg为存在模型不确定性的LiDAR到模型配准问题提供了一种新颖的建筑级别解决方案

Abstract: Accurate registration between LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) point
clouds and semantic 3D city models is a fundamental topic in urban digital
twinning and a prerequisite for downstream tasks, such as digital construction,
change detection and model refinement. However, achieving accurate
LiDAR-to-Model registration at individual building level remains challenging,
particularly due to the generalization uncertainty in semantic 3D city models
at the Level of Detail 2 (LoD2). This paper addresses this gap by proposing
L2M-Reg, a plane-based fine registration method that explicitly accounts for
model uncertainty. L2M-Reg consists of three key steps: establishing reliable
plane correspondence, building a pseudo-plane-constrained Gauss-Helmert model,
and adaptively estimating vertical translation. Experiments on three real-world
datasets demonstrate that L2M-Reg is both more accurate and computationally
efficient than existing ICP-based and plane-based methods. Overall, L2M-Reg
provides a novel building-level solution regarding LiDAR-to-Model registration
when model uncertainty is present.

*Jinhao Wang,Cihan Ruan,Nam Ling,Wei Wang,Wei Jiang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种通用的、数据集无关的方法来识别和重组预训练VAE图像压缩模型中的重要通道，通过分析权重方差、偏置大小和成对相关性等内在参数统计量来估计通道重要性，从而构建不变显著通道空间（ISCS），实现切片并行解码并提高压缩效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有学习图像压缩方法中只有少量潜在通道对重建至关重要，而大多数通道信息有限。现有方法依赖昂贵的数据集特定消融测试，且孤立分析通道而忽略其相互依赖性。

Method: 利用权重方差、偏置大小和成对相关性等内在参数统计量来估计通道重要性，构建不变显著通道空间（ISCS），将通道分为显著核心通道和显著辅助通道，并引入确定性通道排序和分组策略。

Result: 在多个LIC架构上的实验表明，该方法有效降低了比特率和计算量，同时保持重建质量。

Conclusion: 该方法为现有学习压缩框架提供了实用且模块化的增强，通过利用通道重要性不平衡提高了编码和计算效率。

Abstract: Prior studies in learned image compression (LIC) consistently show that only
a small subset of latent channels is critical for reconstruction, while many
others carry limited information. Exploiting this imbalance could improve both
coding and computational efficiency, yet existing approaches often rely on
costly, dataset-specific ablation tests and typically analyze channels in
isolation, ignoring their interdependencies.
  We propose a generalizable, dataset-agnostic method to identify and organize
important channels in pretrained VAE-based LIC models. Instead of brute-force
empirical evaluations, our approach leverages intrinsic parameter
statistics-weight variances, bias magnitudes, and pairwise correlations-to
estimate channel importance. This analysis reveals a consistent organizational
structure, termed the Invariant Salient Channel Space (ISCS), where
Salient-Core channels capture dominant structures and Salient-Auxiliary
channels provide complementary details. Building on ISCS, we introduce a
deterministic channel ordering and grouping strategy that enables
slice-parallel decoding, reduces redundancy, and improves bitrate efficiency.
  Experiments across multiple LIC architectures demonstrate that our method
effectively reduces bitrate and computation while maintaining reconstruction
quality, providing a practical and modular enhancement to existing learned
compression frameworks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有RGB-only 3DGS SLAM方法因深度估计不可靠导致的几何不准确问题。

Method: 采用置信度加权融合机制，动态整合多视角几何深度线索和单目深度先验；使用可变形3DGS地图进行在线优化；基于DROID-SLAM的前端和后端优化。

Result: 在TUM-RGBD、ScanNet等基准测试中，重建精度（L1深度误差）和新视角合成质量（PSNR、SSIM、LPIPS）显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 置信度感知的传感器融合方法能有效提升密集视觉SLAM的state-of-the-art性能。

Abstract: We introduce ConfidentSplat, a novel 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)-based SLAM
system for robust, highfidelity RGB-only reconstruction. Addressing geometric
inaccuracies in existing RGB-only 3DGS SLAM methods that stem from unreliable
depth estimation, ConfidentSplat incorporates a core innovation: a
confidence-weighted fusion mechanism. This mechanism adaptively integrates
depth cues from multiview geometry with learned monocular priors (Omnidata
ViT), dynamically weighting their contributions based on explicit reliability
estimates-derived predominantly from multi-view geometric consistency-to
generate high-fidelity proxy depth for map supervision. The resulting proxy
depth guides the optimization of a deformable 3DGS map, which efficiently
adapts online to maintain global consistency following pose updates from a
DROID-SLAM-inspired frontend and backend optimizations (loop closure, global
bundle adjustment). Extensive validation on standard benchmarks (TUM-RGBD,
ScanNet) and diverse custom mobile datasets demonstrates significant
improvements in reconstruction accuracy (L1 depth error) and novel view
synthesis fidelity (PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS) over baselines, particularly in
challenging conditions. ConfidentSplat underscores the efficacy of principled,
confidence-aware sensor fusion for advancing state-of-the-art dense visual
SLAM.

Abstract: The gaming and entertainment industry is rapidly evolving, driven by
immersive experiences and the integration of generative AI (GAI) technologies.
Training such models effectively requires large-scale datasets that capture the
diversity and context of gaming environments. However, existing datasets are
often limited to specific domains or rely on artificial degradations, which do
not accurately capture the unique characteristics of gaming content. Moreover,
benchmarks for controllable video generation remain absent.
  To address these limitations, we introduce $\mathtt{M^3VIR}$, a large-scale,
multi-modal, multi-view dataset specifically designed to overcome the
shortcomings of current resources. Unlike existing datasets, $\mathtt{M^3VIR}$
provides diverse, high-fidelity gaming content rendered with Unreal Engine 5,
offering authentic ground-truth LR-HR paired and multi-view frames across 80
scenes in 8 categories. It includes $\mathtt{M^3VIR\_MR}$ for super-resolution
(SR), novel view synthesis (NVS), and combined NVS+SR tasks, and
$\mathtt{M^3VIR\_{MS}}$, the first multi-style, object-level ground-truth set
enabling research on controlled video generation. Additionally, we benchmark
several state-of-the-art SR and NVS methods to establish performance baselines.
While no existing approaches directly handle controlled video generation,
$\mathtt{M^3VIR}$ provides a benchmark for advancing this area. By releasing
the dataset, we aim to facilitate research in AI-powered restoration,
compression, and controllable content generation for next-generation cloud
gaming and entertainment.

Conclusion: SAM-DCE成功解决了SAM在医学图像分割中的局限性，提供了更鲁棒和自适应的分割解决方案。

Abstract: The Segment Anything Model (SAM) demonstrates impressive zero-shot
segmentation ability on natural images but encounters difficulties in medical
imaging due to domain shifts, anatomical variability, and its reliance on
user-provided prompts. Recent prompt-free adaptations alleviate the need for
expert intervention, yet still suffer from limited robustness and adaptability,
often overlooking the issues of semantic over-smoothing and token uniformity.
We propose SAM-DCE, which balances local discrimination and global semantics
while mitigating token uniformity, enhancing inter-class separability, and
enriching mask decoding with fine-grained, consistent representations.
Extensive experiments on diverse medical benchmarks validate its effectiveness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前红外小目标检测的评估协议存在三个主要问题：1）使用碎片化的像素级和目标级特定度量，无法全面评估模型能力；2）过度关注整体性能分数而忽视关键误差分析；3）采用数据集特定的训练测试范式，阻碍了对模型鲁棒性和泛化能力的理解。

Result: 开发了一个开源工具包来促进标准化基准测试。

Conclusion: 这些方法旨在提供更全面和合理的分层分析框架，最终促进开发更有效和鲁棒的红外小目标检测模型。

Abstract: As an essential vision task, infrared small target detection (IRSTD) has seen
significant advancements through deep learning. However, critical limitations
in current evaluation protocols impede further progress. First, existing
methods rely on fragmented pixel- and target-level specific metrics, which
fails to provide a comprehensive view of model capabilities. Second, an
excessive emphasis on overall performance scores obscures crucial error
analysis, which is vital for identifying failure modes and improving real-world
system performance. Third, the field predominantly adopts dataset-specific
training-testing paradigms, hindering the understanding of model robustness and
generalization across diverse infrared scenarios. This paper addresses these
issues by introducing a hybrid-level metric incorporating pixel- and
target-level performance, proposing a systematic error analysis method, and
emphasizing the importance of cross-dataset evaluation. These aim to offer a
more thorough and rational hierarchical analysis framework, ultimately
fostering the development of more effective and robust IRSTD models. An
open-source toolkit has be released to facilitate standardized benchmarking.

TL;DR: CoMTIP是一个用于空间转录组学的对比掩码文本-图像预训练框架，通过联合学习图像、基因名称和表达值来获得更好的跨模态表示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法仅使用基因名称或表达值，缺乏基因语义信息且忽略了重要的视觉线索，需要更好的跨模态预训练方法来连接组织学图像和基因表达数据。

Method: 提出CoMTIP框架：视觉分支使用掩码特征建模重建遮挡图像块；文本分支使用可扩展的基因-文本编码器并行处理所有基因句子，采用配对感知对抗训练保持基因-值关联；通过InfoNCE优化在共享空间中对齐图像和文本表示。

Result: 在公共空间转录组学数据集上的实验表明，CoMTIP在多种下游任务上超越现有方法，并能实现零样本基因表达预测。

Conclusion: CoMTIP是首个能够联合学习图像、基因名称和表达值的框架，成功捕获了细粒度视觉上下文，为空间转录组学提供了更强大的预训练方法。

Abstract: Spatial transcriptomics aims to connect high-resolution histology images with
spatially resolved gene expression. To achieve better performance on downstream
tasks such as gene expression prediction, large-scale pre-training is required
to obtain generalisable representations that can bridge histology and
transcriptomics across tissues, protocols, and laboratories. Existing
cross-modal pre-training approaches for spatial transcriptomics rely on either
gene names or expression values in isolation, which strips the gene branch of
essential semantics and breaks the association between each gene and its
quantitative magnitude. In addition, by restricting supervision to image-text
alignment, these methods ignore intrinsic visual cues that are critical for
learning robust image features. We present CoMTIP, the first Contrastive Masked
Text-Image Pretraining framework that jointly learns from images, gene names,
and expression values while capturing fine-grained visual context for spatial
transcriptomics. The vision branch uses Masked Feature Modeling to reconstruct
occluded patches and learn context-aware image embeddings. The text branch
applies a scalable Gene-Text Encoder that processes all gene sentences in
parallel, enriches each gene and its numerical value with dedicated embeddings,
and employs Pair-aware Adversarial Training (PAAT) to preserve correct
gene-value associations. Image and text representations are aligned in a shared
InfoNCE-optimised space. Experiments on public spatial transcriptomics datasets
show that CoMTIP not only surpasses previous methods on diverse downstream
tasks but also achieves zero-shot gene expression prediction, a capability that
existing approaches do not provide.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据自由知识蒸馏方法在小规模图像上表现良好，但在合成大规模图像时会出现模式崩溃，限制了知识迁移效果。直接使用现成扩散模型生成数据集面临精度-召回率挑战：1）确保合成数据与真实分布对齐；2）确保覆盖真实分布流形。

Method: 提出PRISM方法，包含两个核心组件：1）能量引导分布对齐，避免生成分布外样本；2）多样化提示工程，增强对真实分布流形的覆盖。

Result: 在多个大规模图像数据集上的实验表明PRISM具有优越性，使用PRISM训练的模型展现出强大的领域泛化能力。

Conclusion: PRISM通过解决精度-召回率挑战，有效提升了数据自由知识蒸馏在大规模图像上的性能，为无真实数据场景下的模型训练提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Data-free knowledge distillation (DFKD) transfers knowledge from a teacher to
a student without access to the real in-distribution (ID) data. While existing
methods perform well on small-scale images, they suffer from mode collapse when
synthesizing large-scale images, resulting in limited knowledge transfer.
Recently, leveraging advanced generative models to synthesize photorealistic
images has emerged as a promising alternative. Nevertheless, directly using
off-the-shelf diffusion to generate datasets faces the precision-recall
challenges: 1) ensuring synthetic data aligns with the real distribution, and
2) ensuring coverage of the real ID manifold. In response, we propose PRISM, a
precision-recall informed synthesis method. Specifically, we introduce
Energy-guided Distribution Alignment to avoid the generation of
out-of-distribution samples, and design the Diversified Prompt Engineering to
enhance coverage of the real ID manifold. Extensive experiments on various
large-scale image datasets demonstrate the superiority of PRISM. Moreover, we
demonstrate that models trained with PRISM exhibit strong domain
generalization.

Abstract: Survival analysis using whole-slide images (WSIs) is crucial in cancer
research. Despite significant successes, pathology images typically only
provide slide-level labels, which hinders the learning of discriminative
representations from gigapixel WSIs. With the rapid advancement of
high-throughput sequencing technologies, multimodal survival analysis
integrating pathology images and genomics data has emerged as a promising
approach. We propose a Multi-Expert Mamba (ME-Mamba) system that captures
discriminative pathological and genomic features while enabling efficient
integration of both modalities. This approach achieves complementary
information fusion without losing critical information from individual
modalities, thereby facilitating accurate cancer survival analysis.
Specifically, we first introduce a Pathology Expert and a Genomics Expert to
process unimodal data separately. Both experts are designed with Mamba
architectures that incorporate conventional scanning and attention-based
scanning mechanisms, allowing them to extract discriminative features from long
instance sequences containing substantial redundant or irrelevant information.
Second, we design a Synergistic Expert responsible for modality fusion. It
explicitly learns token-level local correspondences between the two modalities
via Optimal Transport, and implicitly enhances distribution consistency through
a global cross-modal fusion loss based on Maximum Mean Discrepancy. The fused
feature representations are then passed to a mamba backbone for further
integration. Through the collaboration of the Pathology Expert, Genomics
Expert, and Synergistic Expert, our method achieves stable and accurate
survival analysis with relatively low computational complexity. Extensive
experimental results on five datasets in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)
demonstrate our state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: We present SLAM-Former, a novel neural approach that integrates full SLAM
capabilities into a single transformer. Similar to traditional SLAM systems,
SLAM-Former comprises both a frontend and a backend that operate in tandem. The
frontend processes sequential monocular images in real-time for incremental
mapping and tracking, while the backend performs global refinement to ensure a
geometrically consistent result. This alternating execution allows the frontend
and backend to mutually promote one another, enhancing overall system
performance. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that SLAM-Former
achieves superior or highly competitive performance compared to

Abstract: Atypical mitotic figures (AMFs) are rare abnormal cell divisions associated
with tumor aggressiveness and poor prognosis. Their detection remains a
significant challenge due to subtle morphological cues, class imbalance, and
inter-observer variability among pathologists. The MIDOG 2025 challenge
introduced a dedicated track for atypical mitosis classification, enabling
systematic evaluation of deep learning methods. In this study, we investigated
the use of large vision foundation models, including Virchow, Virchow2, and
UNI, with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) for parameter-efficient fine-tuning. We
conducted extensive experiments with different LoRA ranks, as well as random
and group-based data splits, to analyze robustness under varied conditions. Our
best approach, Virchow with LoRA rank 8 and ensemble of three-fold
cross-validation, achieved a balanced accuracy of 88.37% on the preliminary
test set, ranking joint 9th in the challenge leaderboard. These results
highlight the promise of foundation models with efficient adaptation strategies
for the classification of atypical mitosis, while underscoring the need for
improvements in specificity and domain generalization.

Conclusion: ProSFDA框架能够有效解决SFDA中的伪标签噪声问题，提升遥感图像语义分割的域自适应性能

Abstract: Source-Free Domain Adaptation (SFDA) enables domain adaptation for semantic
segmentation of Remote Sensing Images (RSIs) using only a well-trained source
model and unlabeled target domain data. However, the lack of ground-truth
labels in the target domain often leads to the generation of noisy
pseudo-labels. Such noise impedes the effective mitigation of domain shift
(DS). To address this challenge, we propose ProSFDA, a prototype-guided SFDA
framework. It employs prototype-weighted pseudo-labels to facilitate reliable
self-training (ST) under pseudo-labels noise. We, in addition, introduce a
prototype-contrast strategy that encourages the aggregation of features
belonging to the same class, enabling the model to learn discriminative target
domain representations without relying on ground-truth supervision. Extensive
experiments show that our approach substantially outperforms existing methods.

Conclusion: SD-RPN为增强MLLM细粒度感知提供了实用且可扩展的解决方案，无需昂贵监督或全模型微调。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) require high-resolution visual
information to perform fine-grained perception, yet processing entire
high-resolution images is computationally prohibitive. While recent methods
leverage a Region-of-Interest (RoI) mechanism to focus on salient areas, they
typically present a difficult trade-off: training-based approaches depend on
large-scale annotated datasets, while training-free methods that utilize the
model's internal attention are computationally inefficient and less accurate,
requiring either multi-pass prefill stages or reliance on the slow
auto-regressive decoding process. In this paper, we propose an efficient,
annotation-free Self-Distilled Region Proposal Network (SD-RPN) that resolves
this trade-off. The SD-RPN is built around a pipeline that transforms the noisy
attention maps from the MLLM's middle layers into high-quality pseudo-RoI
labels by explicitly denoising the signal and resolving ambiguity. We use these
labels to train a lightweight Region Proposal Network (RPN) that learns a more
precise localization. This RPN is also highly efficient, predicting the RoI in
a single forward pass using features from the MLLM's middle layers, decoupling
RoI identification from the auto-regressive generation and avoiding costly
multi-pass operations.To validate our approach, we integrate the framework into
the LLaVA-1.5 architecture. Despite being trained on only a few (e.g. 10K)
question-answer pairs, our method demonstrates exceptional data efficiency and
generalization, achieving over a 10% absolute accuracy improvement on unseen
benchmarks, including TextVQA, DocVQA, and V-Star. Our work presents a
practical and scalable solution for enhancing the fine-grained perception of
MLLMs without requiring costly supervision or full model fine-tuning. Code is

*Ruicong Liu,Takehiko Ohkawa,Tze Ho Elden Tse,Mingfang Zhang,Angela Yao,Yoichi Sato*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RPEP是首个基于事件的3D手部姿态估计预训练方法，利用标记的RGB图像和未配对的未标记事件数据，通过分解手部运动为逐步动作来生成更真实的事件数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 事件数据具有高时间分辨率和低延迟的优势，但在手部姿态估计中的应用受限于标记训练数据的稀缺。现有伪事件生成技术假设物体静止，难以处理动态移动的手部。

Method: RPEP提出新的生成策略，将手部运动分解为较小的逐步动作，并施加运动反转约束来正则化事件生成，构建伪事件-RGB对用于训练。

Result: 在真实事件数据上，RPEP预训练模型显著优于现有最先进方法，在EvRealHands数据集上提升达24%，且只需少量标记样本进行微调即可获得强性能。

Conclusion: RPEP方法有效解决了事件数据标记稀缺的问题，为基于事件的手部姿态估计提供了实用的预训练解决方案，适合实际部署。

Abstract: This paper presents RPEP, the first pre-training method for event-based 3D
hand pose estimation using labeled RGB images and unpaired, unlabeled event
data. Event data offer significant benefits such as high temporal resolution
and low latency, but their application to hand pose estimation is still limited
by the scarcity of labeled training data. To address this, we repurpose real
RGB datasets to train event-based estimators. This is done by constructing
pseudo-event-RGB pairs, where event data is generated and aligned with the
ground-truth poses of RGB images. Unfortunately, existing pseudo-event
generation techniques assume stationary objects, thus struggling to handle
non-stationary, dynamically moving hands. To overcome this, RPEP introduces a
novel generation strategy that decomposes hand movements into smaller,
step-by-step motions. This decomposition allows our method to capture temporal
changes in articulation, constructing more realistic event data for a moving
hand. Additionally, RPEP imposes a motion reversal constraint, regularizing
event generation using reversed motion. Extensive experiments show that our
pre-trained model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on real
event data, achieving up to 24% improvement on EvRealHands. Moreover, it
delivers strong performance with minimal labeled samples for fine-tuning,
making it well-suited for practical deployment.

TL;DR: 提出VidCLearn，一种用于基于扩散的文本到视频生成的持续学习框架，解决现有模型难以融入新数据的问题


<details>

Motivation: 当前文本到视频生成模型依赖静态知识，难以在不重新训练的情况下融入新数据

Method: 采用师生架构，学生模型通过新文本-视频对增量更新，教师模型通过生成回放保留已学知识；引入时间一致性损失增强运动平滑性，以及视频检索模块在推理时提供结构指导

Result: 实验结果显示VidCLearn在视觉质量、语义对齐和时间一致性方面优于基线方法

Conclusion: VidCLearn框架在保持满意生成性能的同时，计算效率更高，能够有效实现文本到视频生成的持续学习

Abstract: Text-to-video generation is an emerging field in generative AI, enabling the
creation of realistic, semantically accurate videos from text prompts. While
current models achieve impressive visual quality and alignment with input text,
they typically rely on static knowledge, making it difficult to incorporate new
data without retraining from scratch. To address this limitation, we propose
VidCLearn, a continual learning framework for diffusion-based text-to-video
generation. VidCLearn features a student-teacher architecture where the student
model is incrementally updated with new text-video pairs, and the teacher model
helps preserve previously learned knowledge through generative replay.
Additionally, we introduce a novel temporal consistency loss to enhance motion
smoothness and a video retrieval module to provide structural guidance at
inference. Our architecture is also designed to be more computationally
efficient than existing models while retaining satisfactory generation
performance. Experimental results show VidCLearn's superiority over baseline
methods in terms of visual quality, semantic alignment, and temporal coherence.

Conclusion: 提出的轻量级框架在保持高性能的同时显著降低了计算复杂度和内存消耗，为多光谱方向目标检测提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Oriented object detection for multi-spectral imagery faces significant
challenges due to differences both within and between modalities. Although
existing methods have improved detection accuracy through complex network
architectures, their high computational complexity and memory consumption
severely restrict their performance. Motivated by the success of large kernel
convolutions in remote sensing, we propose MO R-CNN, a lightweight framework
for multi-spectral oriented detection featuring heterogeneous feature
extraction network (HFEN), single modality supervision (SMS), and
condition-based multimodal label fusion (CMLF). HFEN leverages inter-modal
differences to adaptively align, merge, and enhance multi-modal features. SMS
constrains multi-scale features and enables the model to learn from multiple
modalities. CMLF fuses multimodal labels based on specific rules, providing the
model with a more robust and consistent supervisory signal. Experiments on the
DroneVehicle, VEDAI and OGSOD datasets prove the superiority of our method. The

Motivation: 扩散模型在文本到图像生成中表现出色，但存在物体显示不完整的问题，这限制了模型在下游应用中的性能。

Method: 提出了一种训练免费的解决方案，在预训练的Stable Diffusion模型中，在早期去噪步骤中惩罚图像边界的激活值，只需最小修改和可忽略的计算开销。

Result: 大量实验证明该方法有效，显著提高了物体完整性和图像质量。

Conclusion: 该方法成功解决了扩散模型中物体不完整的问题，且易于应用到现有预训练模型中。

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as a powerful technique for text-to-image (T2I)
generation, creating high-quality, diverse images across various domains.
However, a common limitation in these models is the incomplete display of
objects, where fragments or missing parts undermine the model's performance in
downstream applications. In this study, we conduct an in-depth analysis of the
incompleteness issue and reveal that the primary factor behind incomplete
object generation is the usage of RandomCrop during model training. This widely
used data augmentation method, though enhances model generalization ability,
disrupts object continuity during training. To address this, we propose a
training-free solution that penalizes activation values at image boundaries
during the early denoising steps. Our method is easily applicable to
pre-trained Stable Diffusion models with minimal modifications and negligible
computational overhead. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of
our method, showing substantial improvements in object integrity and image
quality.

Abstract: Sparse annotation in remote sensing object detection poses significant
challenges due to dense object distributions and category imbalances. Although
existing Dense Pseudo-Label methods have demonstrated substantial potential in
pseudo-labeling tasks, they remain constrained by selection ambiguities and
inconsistencies in confidence estimation.In this paper, we introduce an
LLM-assisted semantic guidance framework tailored for sparsely annotated remote
sensing object detection, exploiting the advanced semantic reasoning
capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to distill high-confidence
pseudo-labels.By integrating LLM-generated semantic priors, we propose a
Class-Aware Dense Pseudo-Label Assignment mechanism that adaptively assigns
pseudo-labels for both unlabeled and sparsely labeled data, ensuring robust
supervision across varying data distributions. Additionally, we develop an
Adaptive Hard-Negative Reweighting Module to stabilize the supervised learning
branch by mitigating the influence of confounding background information.
Extensive experiments on DOTA and HRSC2016 demonstrate that the proposed method
outperforms existing single-stage detector-based frameworks, significantly
improving detection performance under sparse annotations.

Conclusion: 研究表明，高效的分割增强和测试时集成技术能够显著提升基于多模态大语言模型的视频对象分割性能。

Abstract: Referring video object segmentation (RVOS) requires segmenting and tracking
objects in videos conditioned on natural-language expressions, demanding
fine-grained understanding of both appearance and motion. Building on Sa2VA,
which couples a Multi-modal Large Language Model (MLLM) with the video
segmentation model SAM2, we identify two key bottlenecks that limit
segmentation performance: sparse frame sampling and reliance on a single [SEG]
token for an entire video. We propose Segmentation Augmented and Selective
Averaged Sa2VA SaSaSa2VA to address these issues. On the 7th LSVOS Challenge
(RVOS track), SaSaSa2VA achieves a $J\&F$ of 67.45, ranking first and
surpassing the runner-up by 2.80 points. This result and ablation studies
demonstrate that efficient segmentation augmentation and test-time ensembling
substantially enhance grounded MLLMs for RVOS. The code is released in Sa2VA

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统HTR方法需要大量标注数据的问题，特别适用于历史档案等低资源领域，利用词汇特征的先验知识来缓解标注数据稀缺的挑战。

Method: 采用迭代自举方法：从少量标注样本开始，使用最优传输将未标注图像的特征与语义词表示对齐，生成高置信度的伪标签，并在不断增长的数据集上重新训练识别器。

Result: 数值实验表明，该迭代视觉-语义对齐方案在低资源HTR基准测试中显著提高了识别准确率。

Conclusion: 该框架为低资源手写文本识别提供了一种有效的解决方案，能够利用有限的标注数据和词汇先验知识实现高性能识别。

Abstract: Handwritten Text Recognition (HTR) is a task of central importance in the
field of document image understanding. State-of-the-art methods for HTR require
the use of extensive annotated sets for training, making them impractical for
low-resource domains like historical archives or limited-size modern
collections. This paper introduces a novel framework that, unlike the standard
HTR model paradigm, can leverage mild prior knowledge of lexical
characteristics; this is ideal for scenarios where labeled data are scarce. We
propose an iterative bootstrapping approach that aligns visual features
extracted from unlabeled images with semantic word representations using
Optimal Transport (OT). Starting with a minimal set of labeled examples, the
framework iteratively matches word images to text labels, generates
pseudo-labels for high-confidence alignments, and retrains the recognizer on
the growing dataset. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our iterative
visual-semantic alignment scheme significantly improves recognition accuracy on
low-resource HTR benchmarks.

TL;DR: 提出了Visual Contrast Exploitation (VCE)框架，用于保护自回归图像生成模型免受不安全内容生成的影响，通过对比图像对构建和DPO训练实现精确概念擦除。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自回归图像生成模型（如GPT-4o、LlamaGen）能生成逼真图像，但也可能产生NSFW内容，引发版权和伦理问题。现有概念擦除方法主要针对扩散模型，不适用于自回归模型。

Method: VCE框架包含：(1)创新的对比图像对构建范式，精确解耦不安全概念与内容语义；(2)基于DPO的精细训练方法，增强模型识别和利用图像对中视觉对比特征的能力。

Result: 在三个挑战性任务（艺术家风格擦除、显式内容擦除、对象移除）上的实验表明，该方法能有效保护模型，在擦除不安全概念的同时保持无关安全概念的完整性，达到最先进效果。

Conclusion: VCE为解决自回归图像生成模型的安全问题提供了有效方案，代码和模型已开源。

Abstract: Recently, autoregressive image generation models have wowed audiences with
their remarkable capability in creating surprisingly realistic images. Models
such as GPT-4o and LlamaGen can not only produce images that faithfully mimic
renowned artistic styles like Ghibli, Van Gogh, or Picasso, but also
potentially generate Not-Safe-For-Work (NSFW) content, raising significant
concerns regarding copyright infringement and ethical use. Despite these
concerns, methods to safeguard autoregressive text-to-image models remain
underexplored. Previous concept erasure methods, primarily designed for
diffusion models that operate in denoising latent space, are not directly
applicable to autoregressive models that generate images token by token. To
address this critical gap, we propose Visual Contrast Exploitation (VCE), a
novel framework comprising: (1) an innovative contrastive image pair
construction paradigm that precisely decouples unsafe concepts from their
associated content semantics, and (2) a sophisticated DPO-based training
approach that enhances the model's ability to identify and leverage visual
contrastive features from image pairs, enabling precise concept erasure. Our
comprehensive experiments across three challenging tasks-artist style erasure,
explicit content erasure, and object removal-demonstrate that our method
effectively secures the model, achieving state-of-the-art results while erasing
unsafe concepts and maintaining the integrity of unrelated safe concepts. The
code and models are available at https://github.com/Maplebb/VCE.

Abstract: Hyperspectral change detection (HCD) aims to accurately identify land-cover
changes in hyperspectral images of the same area acquired at different times,
with key applications in environmental monitoring and disaster assessment. To
address limitations of existing methods, such as insufficient use of multiscale
features and low efficiency in differential feature fusion, this paper proposes
a cross-hierarchical multi-feature fusion network (CHMFFN) based on a
multiscale encoder-decoder architecture. The front-end adopts a multiscale
feature extraction subnetwork, built on an encoder-decoder backbone with
residual connections and a dual-core channel-spatial attention (DCCSA) module
to extract spectral-spatial-temporal features (SSTF). The encoder captures
multiscale features from shallow details to deep semantics via residual blocks
and convolutional kernels with varying receptive fields. The decoder restores
spatial resolution and suppresses noise information through skip connections
integrating encoder features. Additionally, a spectral-temporal change feature
learning (STCFL) module learns cross-temporal change features at different
levels, strengthening inter-temporal difference capture. An adaptive fusion of
advanced features (AFAF) module dynamically balances hierarchical differential
features via adaptive weights, enhancing representation of complex changes.
Experiments on four public hyperspectral datasets show CHMFFN outperforms
state-of-the-art methods, verifying its effectiveness.

Abstract: Document image quality assessment (DIQA) is an important component for
various applications, including optical character recognition (OCR), document
restoration, and the evaluation of document image processing systems. In this
paper, we introduce a subjective DIQA dataset DIQA-5000. The DIQA-5000 dataset
comprises 5,000 document images, generated by applying multiple document
enhancement techniques to 500 real-world images with diverse distortions. Each
enhanced image was rated by 15 subjects across three rating dimensions: overall
quality, sharpness, and color fidelity. Furthermore, we propose a specialized
no-reference DIQA model that exploits document layout features to maintain
quality perception at reduced resolutions to lower computational cost.
Recognizing that image quality is influenced by both low-level and high-level
visual features, we designed a feature fusion module to extract and integrate
multi-level features from document images. To generate multi-dimensional
scores, our model employs independent quality heads for each dimension to
predict score distributions, allowing it to learn distinct aspects of document
image quality. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms

Abstract: Adverse Weather Image Restoration (AWIR) is a highly challenging task due to
the unpredictable and dynamic nature of weather-related degradations.
Traditional task-specific methods often fail to generalize to unseen or complex
degradation types, while recent prompt-learning approaches depend heavily on
the degradation estimation capabilities of vision-language models, resulting in
inconsistent restorations. In this paper, we propose \textbf{LCDiff}, a novel
framework comprising two key components: \textit{Lumina-Chroma Decomposition
Network} (LCDN) and \textit{Lumina-Guided Diffusion Model} (LGDM). LCDN
processes degraded images in the YCbCr color space, separately handling
degradation-related luminance and degradation-invariant chrominance components.
This decomposition effectively mitigates weather-induced degradation while
preserving color fidelity. To further enhance restoration quality, LGDM
leverages degradation-related luminance information as a guiding condition,
eliminating the need for explicit degradation prompts. Additionally, LGDM
incorporates a \textit{Dynamic Time Step Loss} to optimize the denoising
network, ensuring a balanced recovery of both low- and high-frequency features
in the image. Finally, we present DriveWeather, a comprehensive all-weather
driving dataset designed to enable robust evaluation. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our approach surpasses state-of-the-art methods, setting a new
benchmark in AWIR. The dataset and code are available at:

Abstract: Surgical simulation is essential for medical training, enabling practitioners
to develop crucial skills in a risk-free environment while improving patient
safety and surgical outcomes. However, conventional methods for building
simulation environments are cumbersome, time-consuming, and difficult to scale,
often resulting in poor details and unrealistic simulations. In this paper, we
propose a Gaussian Splatting-based framework to directly reconstruct
interactive surgical scenes from endoscopic data while ensuring efficiency,
rendering quality, and realism. A key challenge in this data-driven simulation
paradigm is the restricted movement of endoscopic cameras, which limits
viewpoint diversity. As a result, the Gaussian Splatting representation
overfits specific perspectives, leading to reduced geometric accuracy. To
address this issue, we introduce a novel virtual camera-based regularization
method that adaptively samples virtual viewpoints around the scene and
incorporates them into the optimization process to mitigate overfitting. An
effective depth-based regularization is applied to both real and virtual views
to further refine the scene geometry. To enable fast deformation simulation, we
propose a sparse control node-based Material Point Method, which integrates
physical properties into the reconstructed scene while significantly reducing
computational costs. Experimental results on representative surgical data
demonstrate that our method can efficiently reconstruct and simulate surgical
scenes from sparse endoscopic views. Notably, our method takes only a few
minutes to reconstruct the surgical scene and is able to produce physically
plausible deformations in real-time with user-defined interactions.

Abstract: Multi-image Interleaved Reasoning aims to improve Multi-modal Large Language
Models (MLLMs) ability to jointly comprehend and reason across multiple images
and their associated textual contexts, introducing unique challenges beyond
single-image or non-interleaved multi-image tasks. While current multi-image
benchmarks overlook interleaved textual contexts and neglect distinct
relationships between individual images and their associated texts, enabling
models to reason over multi-image interleaved data may significantly enhance
their comprehension of complex scenes and better capture cross-modal
correlations. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel benchmark MIR, requiring
joint reasoning over multiple images accompanied by interleaved textual
contexts to accurately associate image regions with corresponding texts and
logically connect information across images. To enhance MLLMs ability to
comprehend multi-image interleaved data, we introduce reasoning steps for each
instance within the benchmark and propose a stage-wise curriculum learning
strategy. This strategy follows an "easy to hard" approach, progressively
guiding models from simple to complex scenarios, thereby enhancing their
ability to handle challenging tasks. Extensive experiments benchmarking
multiple MLLMs demonstrate that our method significantly enhances models
reasoning performance on MIR and other established benchmarks. We believe that
MIR will encourage further research into multi-image interleaved reasoning,
facilitating advancements in MLLMs capability to handle complex inter-modal
tasks.Our code and dataset are available at

TL;DR: 本文提出了SimpSyn，一种轻量级的单阶段残差U-Net模型，用于电子显微镜图像中的突触检测，在多个数据集上优于现有最先进方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决电子显微镜图像中突触检测的挑战，包括稀疏标注、形态变异性和跨数据集域偏移问题，为大规模连接组学提供可扩展解决方案。

Method: 提出SimpSyn模型，使用单阶段残差U-Net预测突触前后位点的双通道球形掩码，强调训练和推理速度以及标注效率而非架构复杂性。

Result: SimpSyn在四个数据集（两种无脊椎动物）上均优于Synful方法，F1分数更高；在组合数据集上训练时达到竞争性性能。

Conclusion: 轻量级模型与任务结构对齐时，可为大规模连接组学管道中的突触检测提供实用且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Behavioural differences across organisms, whether healthy or pathological,
are closely tied to the structure of their neural circuits. Yet, the fine-scale
synaptic changes that give rise to these variations remain poorly understood,
in part due to persistent challenges in detecting synapses reliably and at
scale. Volume electron microscopy (EM) offers the resolution required to
capture synaptic architecture, but automated detection remains difficult due to
sparse annotations, morphological variability, and cross-dataset domain shifts.
To address this, we make three key contributions. First, we curate a diverse EM
benchmark spanning four datasets across two invertebrate species: adult and
larval Drosophila melanogaster, and Megaphragma viggianii (micro-WASP). Second,
we propose SimpSyn, a single-stage Residual U-Net trained to predict
dual-channel spherical masks around pre- and post-synaptic sites, designed to
prioritize training and inference speeds and annotation efficiency over
architectural complexity. Third, we benchmark SimpSyn against Buhmann et al.'s
Synful [1], a state-of-the-art multi-task model that jointly infers synaptic
pairs. Despite its simplicity, SimpSyn consistently outperforms Synful in
F1-score across all volumes for synaptic site detection. While generalization
across datasets remains limited, SimpSyn achieves competitive performance when
trained on the combined cohort. Finally, ablations reveal that simple
post-processing strategies - such as local peak detection and distance-based
filtering - yield strong performance without complex test-time heuristics.
Taken together, our results suggest that lightweight models, when aligned with
task structure, offer a practical and scalable solution for synapse detection
in large-scale connectomic pipelines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有作物病害诊断方法主要依赖单模态模型（如图像分类器），无法整合农业领域专业知识，缺乏基于语言的交互理解能力。大型语言模型和视觉语言模型在农业领域的应用受到专业数据集缺乏和领域适应性不足的限制。

Method: 提出AgriDoctor模块化多模态框架，包含路由器、分类器、检测器、知识检索器和LLM五个核心组件。构建了AgriMM基准数据集，包含40万张标注病害图像、831条专家知识条目和30万双语提示。

Abstract: Accurate crop disease diagnosis is essential for sustainable agriculture and
global food security. Existing methods, which primarily rely on unimodal models
such as image-based classifiers and object detectors, are limited in their
ability to incorporate domain-specific agricultural knowledge and lack support
for interactive, language-based understanding. Recent advances in large
language models (LLMs) and large vision-language models (LVLMs) have opened new
avenues for multimodal reasoning. However, their performance in agricultural
contexts remains limited due to the absence of specialized datasets and
insufficient domain adaptation. In this work, we propose AgriDoctor, a modular
and extensible multimodal framework designed for intelligent crop disease
diagnosis and agricultural knowledge interaction. As a pioneering effort to
introduce agent-based multimodal reasoning into the agricultural domain,
AgriDoctor offers a novel paradigm for building interactive and domain-adaptive
crop health solutions. It integrates five core components: a router,
classifier, detector, knowledge retriever and LLMs. To facilitate effective
training and evaluation, we construct AgriMM, a comprehensive benchmark
comprising 400000 annotated disease images, 831 expert-curated knowledge
entries, and 300000 bilingual prompts for intent-driven tool selection.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that AgriDoctor, trained on AgriMM,
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art LVLMs on fine-grained agricultural
tasks, establishing a new paradigm for intelligent and sustainable farming
applications.

Abstract: Fine-grained hashing has become a powerful solution for rapid and efficient
image retrieval, particularly in scenarios requiring high discrimination
between visually similar categories. To enable each hash bit to correspond to
specific visual attributes, we propoe a novel method that harnesses learnable
queries for attribute-aware hash codes learning. This method deploys a tailored
set of queries to capture and represent nuanced attribute-level information
within the hashing process, thereby enhancing both the interpretability and
relevance of each hash bit. Building on this query-based optimization
framework, we incorporate an auxiliary branch to help alleviate the challenges
of complex landscape optimization often encountered with low-bit hash codes.
This auxiliary branch models high-order attribute interactions, reinforcing the
robustness and specificity of the generated hash codes. Experimental results on
benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method generates attribute-aware hash
codes and consistently outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in retrieval
accuracy and robustness, especially for low-bit hash codes, underscoring its
potential in fine-grained image hashing tasks.

Motivation: 深度视觉特征普遍存在非线性流形结构，欧氏距离难以捕捉真实相似性，这在需要细微语义区分的原型可解释细粒度识别中尤为严重。

Method: 将每个类的潜在流形结构蒸馏到扩散空间，引入可微分Nyström插值使几何对未见样本和可学习原型都可访问，使用紧凑的每类地标集并定期更新以保持效率。

Conclusion: GeoProto框架通过利用深度特征的本征几何，有效提升了原型可解释细粒度识别的性能，证明了几何感知方法在此任务中的优势。

Abstract: Nonlinear manifolds are widespread in deep visual features, where Euclidean
distances often fail to capture true similarity. This limitation becomes
particularly severe in prototype-based interpretable fine-grained recognition,
where subtle semantic distinctions are essential. To address this challenge, we
propose a novel paradigm for prototype-based recognition that anchors
similarity within the intrinsic geometry of deep features. Specifically, we
distill the latent manifold structure of each class into a diffusion space and
introduce a differentiable Nystr\"om interpolation, making the geometry
accessible to both unseen samples and learnable prototypes. To ensure
efficiency, we employ compact per-class landmark sets with periodic updates.
This design keeps the embedding aligned with the evolving backbone, enabling
fast and scalable inference. Extensive experiments on the CUB-200-2011 and
Stanford Cars datasets show that our GeoProto framework produces prototypes
focusing on semantically aligned parts, significantly outperforming Euclidean
prototype networks.

Motivation: 现有LVEF估计方法依赖大规模标注视频数据集，成本高且临床适应性差。现有视觉语言模型如EchoCLIP无法捕捉关键的时间动态和局部心脏结构，影响诊断准确性。

Method: 提出CardiacCLIP框架，包含MFL（多帧学习）注意力机制选择性融合信息帧，以及EchoZoom多尺度特征提取策略优化心脏结构空间表示。

Result: 在EchoNet-Dynamic数据集上，1-shot设置下MAE降低了2.07，显著提高了诊断准确性。

Conclusion: CardiacCLIP作为CLIP模型在少样本超声心动图视频分析中的新适应方法，有效提升了LVEF预测性能，代码已开源。

Abstract: Echocardiography is a vital non-invasive modality for cardiac assessment,
with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) serving as a key indicator of
heart function. Existing LVEF estimation methods depend on large-scale
annotated video datasets, which are costly and limit adaptability across
various clinical settings. Recent vision-language models for echocardiography,
such as EchoCLIP, apply image-to-text pretraining but fail to capture crucial
temporal dynamics and localized cardiac structures essential for accurate
diagnosis. To address these challenges, we propose CardiacCLIP, a video-based
framework that enhances LVEF prediction through attention-based frame
aggregation and multi-resolution input scaling. Specifically, we introduce MFL
(Multi Frame Learning), a novel attention-based mechanism for selectively
fusing informative frames, and EchoZoom, a multi-scale feature extraction
strategy that refines spatial representations of cardiac structures. As a novel
adaptation of CLIP models for few-shot echocardiogram video analysis, our
approach significantly improves diagnostic accuracy, reducing MAE by 2.07 on
the EchoNet-Dynamic dataset under 1-shot setting. The code is available at

Abstract: Visual affordance learning is crucial for robots to understand and interact
effectively with the physical world. Recent advances in this field attempt to
leverage pre-trained knowledge of vision-language foundation models to learn
affordance properties with limited training data, providing a novel paradigm
for visual affordance learning. However, these methods overlook the
significance of maintaining feature alignment between visual images and
language descriptions for identifying affordance areas with textual guidance,
and thus may lead to suboptimal results. In this paper, we present an
informative framework for text-guided affordance learning, which involves
information-based constraints to achieve text-image alignment at feature level.
Specifically, we design an affordance mutual information constraint that helps
learn appropriate textual prompts and task-oriented visual features
simultaneously by maximizing the mutual information between the features of the
affordance areas in the input images and the corresponding textual prompts. In
addition, we propose an object-level information constraint that maximizes the
mutual information between the visual features of a given object and the text
features of the category it belongs to. This enables the model to capture
high-quality representations for the object, providing more reliable semantic
priors for identifying affordance regions. Experimental results on the AGD20K
dataset show that the proposed method outperforms existing approaches and
achieves the new state-of-the-art in one-shot affordance learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决YOLOv8等单阶段检测器在检测小物体（特别是在航空影像中）时性能不足的问题，这些场景中目标分辨率低、背景复杂。

Method: 1. 输入图像分辨率调整 2. 数据增强技术 3. 注意力机制（SE Block和CBAM）集成到YOLOv8主干网络 4. 设计MoonNet管道，包含注意力增强的CNN架构

Result: 图像尺寸放大和适当的数据增强能带来性能提升；MoonNet主干网络相比原始YOLOv8获得了改进的检测精度；与YOLC模型集成后在微小物体检测基准上达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: 提出的三种增强策略和MoonNet架构有效提升了YOLOv8在微小物体检测上的性能，证明了注意力机制在复杂场景下检测小物体的有效性。

Abstract: While one-stage detectors like YOLOv8 offer fast training speed, they often
under-perform on detecting small objects as a trade-off. This becomes even more
critical when detecting tiny objects in aerial imagery due to low-resolution
targets and cluttered backgrounds. To address this, we introduce three
enhancement strategies -- input image resolution adjustment, data augmentation,
and attention mechanisms -- that can be easily implemented on YOLOv8. We
demonstrate that image size enlargement and the proper use of augmentation can
lead to enhancement. Additionally, we designed a Mixture of Orthogonal
Neural-modules Network (MoonNet) pipeline which consists of attention-augmented
CNNs. Two well-known attention modules, the Squeeze-and-Excitation Block (SE
Block) and the Convolutional Block Attention Module (CBAM), were integrated
into the backbone of YOLOv8 with an increased number of channels, and the
MoonNet backbone obtained improved detection accuracy compared to the original
YOLOv8. MoonNet further proved its adaptability and potential by achieving
state-of-the-art performance on a tiny-object benchmark when integrated with
the YOLC model. Our codes are available at: https://github.com/Kihyun11/MoonNet

Motivation: 现有基于Transformer的方法虽然擅长捕捉全局上下文，但缺乏空间归纳偏置导致注意力分散到无关背景区域，影响人群定位精度，且RGB与热成像模态之间存在融合难题。

Method: 双调制框架包含：1）空间调制注意力（SMA），使用可学习的空间衰减掩码惩罚远距离token间的注意力，防止注意力扩散到背景；2）自适应融合调制（AFM），通过动态门控机制优先选择最可靠的模态进行自适应跨模态融合。

Result: 在RGB-T人群计数数据集上的大量实验表明，该方法相比先前工作具有优越性能。

Conclusion: 提出的双调制框架有效解决了RGB-热成像人群计数中的定位精度和模态融合问题，实现了更好的性能。

Abstract: Accurate RGB-Thermal (RGB-T) crowd counting is crucial for public safety in
challenging conditions. While recent Transformer-based methods excel at
capturing global context, their inherent lack of spatial inductive bias causes
attention to spread to irrelevant background regions, compromising crowd
localization precision. Furthermore, effectively bridging the gap between these
distinct modalities remains a major hurdle. To tackle this, we propose the Dual
Modulation Framework, comprising two modules: Spatially Modulated Attention
(SMA), which improves crowd localization by using a learnable Spatial Decay
Mask to penalize attention between distant tokens and prevent focus from
spreading to the background; and Adaptive Fusion Modulation (AFM), which
implements a dynamic gating mechanism to prioritize the most reliable modality
for adaptive cross-modal fusion. Extensive experiments on RGB-T crowd counting
datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our method compared to
previous works. Code available at

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D高斯溅射(3DGS)虽然能实现实时高质量新视角合成，但存在显著内存开销问题。现有神经场压缩方法难以捕捉高斯属性的高频空间变化，导致细节重建质量下降。

Method: HyRF将场景分解为：(1)存储关键高频参数的紧凑显式高斯集合；(2)预测剩余属性的网格神经场。采用解耦神经场架构分别建模几何和视图相关颜色，并提出混合渲染方案结合高斯溅射和神经场预测背景。

Conclusion: HyRF成功结合了显式高斯和神经场的优势，解决了3DGS的内存开销问题，同时保持了高质量的细节重建能力。

Abstract: Recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has emerged as a powerful alternative
to NeRF-based approaches, enabling real-time, high-quality novel view synthesis
through explicit, optimizable 3D Gaussians. However, 3DGS suffers from
significant memory overhead due to its reliance on per-Gaussian parameters to
model view-dependent effects and anisotropic shapes. While recent works propose
compressing 3DGS with neural fields, these methods struggle to capture
high-frequency spatial variations in Gaussian properties, leading to degraded
reconstruction of fine details. We present Hybrid Radiance Fields (HyRF), a
novel scene representation that combines the strengths of explicit Gaussians
and neural fields. HyRF decomposes the scene into (1) a compact set of explicit
Gaussians storing only critical high-frequency parameters and (2) grid-based
neural fields that predict remaining properties. To enhance representational
capacity, we introduce a decoupled neural field architecture, separately
modeling geometry (scale, opacity, rotation) and view-dependent color.
Additionally, we propose a hybrid rendering scheme that composites Gaussian
splatting with a neural field-predicted background, addressing limitations in
distant scene representation. Experiments demonstrate that HyRF achieves
state-of-the-art rendering quality while reducing model size by over 20 times
compared to 3DGS and maintaining real-time performance. Our project page is

Abstract: Video action recognition is a fundamental task in computer vision, but
state-of-the-art models are often computationally expensive and rely on
extensive video pre-training. In parallel, large-scale vision-language models
like Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) offer powerful zero-shot
capabilities on static images, while motion vectors (MV) provide highly
efficient temporal information directly from compressed video streams. To
synergize the strengths of these paradigms, we propose MoCLIP-Lite, a simple
yet powerful two-stream late fusion framework for efficient video recognition.
Our approach combines features from a frozen CLIP image encoder with features
from a lightweight, supervised network trained on raw MV. During fusion, both
backbones are frozen, and only a tiny Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) head is
trained, ensuring extreme efficiency. Through comprehensive experiments on the
UCF101 dataset, our method achieves a remarkable 89.2% Top-1 accuracy,
significantly outperforming strong zero-shot (65.0%) and MV-only (66.5%)

Result: 实验验证该方法能有效增强生成图像间的风格一致性，同时保持精确的文本-图像对齐。

Conclusion: AlignedGen为DiT模型提供了有效的风格一致性解决方案，具有广泛的应用前景。

Abstract: Despite their generative power, diffusion models struggle to maintain style
consistency across images conditioned on the same style prompt, hindering their
practical deployment in creative workflows. While several training-free methods
attempt to solve this, they are constrained to the U-Net architecture, which
not only leads to low-quality results and artifacts like object repetition but
also renders them incompatible with superior Diffusion Transformer (DiT). To
address these issues, we introduce AlignedGen, a novel training-free framework
that enhances style consistency across images generated by DiT models. Our work
first reveals a critical insight: naive attention sharing fails in DiT due to
conflicting positional signals from improper position embeddings. We introduce
Shifted Position Embedding (ShiftPE), an effective solution that resolves this
conflict by allocating a non-overlapping set of positional indices to each
image. Building on this foundation, we develop Advanced Attention Sharing
(AAS), a suite of three techniques meticulously designed to fully unleash the
potential of attention sharing within the DiT. Furthermore, to broaden the
applicability of our method, we present an efficient query, key, and value
feature extraction algorithm, enabling our method to seamlessly incorporate
external images as style references. Extensive experimental results validate
that our method effectively enhances style consistency across generated images
while maintaining precise text-to-image alignment.

Abstract: Uncertainty estimation has been widely studied in medical image segmentation
as a tool to provide reliability, particularly in deep learning approaches.
However, previous methods generally lack effective supervision in uncertainty
estimation, leading to low interpretability and robustness of the predictions.
In this work, we propose a self-supervised approach to guide the learning of
uncertainty. Specifically, we introduce three principles about the
relationships between the uncertainty and the image gradients around boundaries
and noise. Based on these principles, two uncertainty supervision losses are
designed. These losses enhance the alignment between model predictions and
human interpretation. Accordingly, we introduce novel quantitative metrics for
evaluating the interpretability and robustness of uncertainty. Experimental
results demonstrate that compared to state-of-the-art approaches, the proposed

Abstract: Advances in artificial intelligence (AI) for surgical quality assessment
promise to democratize access to expertise, with applications in training,
guidance, and accreditation. This study presents the SAGES Critical View of
Safety (CVS) Challenge, the first AI competition organized by a surgical
society, using the CVS in laparoscopic cholecystectomy, a universally
recommended yet inconsistently performed safety step, as an exemplar of
surgical quality assessment. A global collaboration across 54 institutions in
24 countries engaged hundreds of clinicians and engineers to curate 1,000
videos annotated by 20 surgical experts according to a consensus-validated
protocol. The challenge addressed key barriers to real-world deployment in
surgery, including achieving high performance, capturing uncertainty in
subjective assessment, and ensuring robustness to clinical variability. To
enable this scale of effort, we developed EndoGlacier, a framework for managing
large, heterogeneous surgical video and multi-annotator workflows. Thirteen
international teams participated, achieving up to a 17\% relative gain in
assessment performance, over 80\% reduction in calibration error, and a 17\%
relative improvement in robustness over the state-of-the-art. Analysis of
results highlighted methodological trends linked to model performance,
providing guidance for future research toward robust, clinically deployable AI
for surgical quality assessment.

*Lingzhao Kong,Jiacheng Lin,Siyu Li,Kai Luo,Zhiyong Li,Kailun Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoBEVMoE是一个新颖的协作感知框架，在BEV空间中使用动态专家混合架构，通过动态生成专家来建模特征相似性和异质性，在OPV2V和DAIR-V2X-C数据集上实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有中间融合方法主要关注对齐相似特征，但忽略了智能体之间的感知多样性差异。由于视角和空间位置的不同，智能体往往获得异构的观测数据。

Method: 提出CoBEVMoE框架，在BEV空间中使用动态专家混合架构，每个专家基于特定智能体的输入特征动态生成，能够提取独特可靠线索并关注共享语义。还引入了动态专家度量损失来增强专家间多样性。

Result: 在OPV2V数据集上，相机BEV分割的IoU提高了+1.5%；在DAIR-V2X-C数据集上，LiDAR 3D目标检测的AP@50提高了+3.0%，验证了基于专家的异构特征建模的有效性。

Conclusion: CoBEVMoE通过动态专家混合架构成功建模了多智能体协作感知中的特征相似性和异质性，显著提升了感知性能，证明了异构特征建模的重要性。

Abstract: Collaborative perception aims to extend sensing coverage and improve
perception accuracy by sharing information among multiple agents. However, due
to differences in viewpoints and spatial positions, agents often acquire
heterogeneous observations. Existing intermediate fusion methods primarily
focus on aligning similar features, often overlooking the perceptual diversity
among agents. To address this limitation, we propose CoBEVMoE, a novel
collaborative perception framework that operates in the Bird's Eye View (BEV)
space and incorporates a Dynamic Mixture-of-Experts (DMoE) architecture. In
DMoE, each expert is dynamically generated based on the input features of a
specific agent, enabling it to extract distinctive and reliable cues while
attending to shared semantics. This design allows the fusion process to
explicitly model both feature similarity and heterogeneity across agents.
Furthermore, we introduce a Dynamic Expert Metric Loss (DEML) to enhance
inter-expert diversity and improve the discriminability of the fused
representation. Extensive experiments on the OPV2V and DAIR-V2X-C datasets
demonstrate that CoBEVMoE achieves state-of-the-art performance. Specifically,
it improves the IoU for Camera-based BEV segmentation by +1.5% on OPV2V and the
AP@50 for LiDAR-based 3D object detection by +3.0% on DAIR-V2X-C, verifying the
effectiveness of expert-based heterogeneous feature modeling in multi-agent
collaborative perception. The source code will be made publicly available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Stencil是一个新颖的文本到图像生成框架，通过联合使用两个扩散模型来解决主体一致性生成中的质量与效率权衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前微调方法在主体驱动的图像生成中存在固有权衡：微调大模型提高保真度但计算成本高，微调轻量级模型效率高但图像质量受损。此外，在小样本图像上微调预训练模型会破坏现有先验知识。

Method: Stencil在推理过程中联合使用两个扩散模型：高效微调轻量级模型处理主体图像，同时使用大型冻结预训练模型提供上下文指导，注入丰富先验知识以最小开销增强生成效果。

Result: Stencil能够在不到一分钟内生成高保真度的主体新颖渲染，实现了最先进的性能，为主体驱动生成设定了新基准。

Conclusion: 该框架成功解决了主体一致性生成中的质量-效率权衡问题，通过双模型协同工作实现了高效高质量的主体驱动图像生成。

Abstract: Recent text-to-image diffusion models can generate striking visuals from text
prompts, but they often fail to maintain subject consistency across generations
and contexts. One major limitation of current fine-tuning approaches is the
inherent trade-off between quality and efficiency. Fine-tuning large models
improves fidelity but is computationally expensive, while fine-tuning
lightweight models improves efficiency but compromises image fidelity.
Moreover, fine-tuning pre-trained models on a small set of images of the
subject can damage the existing priors, resulting in suboptimal results. To
this end, we present Stencil, a novel framework that jointly employs two
diffusion models during inference. Stencil efficiently fine-tunes a lightweight
model on images of the subject, while a large frozen pre-trained model provides
contextual guidance during inference, injecting rich priors to enhance
generation with minimal overhead. Stencil excels at generating high-fidelity,
novel renditions of the subject in less than a minute, delivering
state-of-the-art performance and setting a new benchmark in subject-driven
generation.

Conclusion: SAEC框架成功解决了工业视觉检测中精度与效率的权衡问题，通过智能资源分配实现了高性能的缺陷检测，为实际工业应用提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: Industrial vision inspection requires high accuracy under stringent resource
constraints, yet existing approaches face a fundamental trade-off. Multimodal
LLMs (MLLMs) deliver strong reasoning capabilities but incur prohibitive
computational costs, while lightweight edge models often fail on complex cases.
In this paper, we present SAEC, a scene-aware enhanced edge-cloud collaborative
industrial vision inspection framework with MLLM. The framework is composed of
three synergistic components: (1) Efficient MLLM Fine-Tuning for Complex Defect
Inspection, (2) Lightweight Multiscale Scene-Complexity Estimation, and (3)
Adaptive Edge-Cloud Scheduler. Together, these modules enable robust defect
detection by tailoring multimodal reasoning to scene complexity and dynamically
balancing computation between edge and cloud resources. Experimental results on
MVTec AD and KSDD2 datasets demonstrate that SAEC attains 85.11% and 82.72%
accuracy, surpassing Qwen by 22.1% and 20.8%, and LLaVA by 33.3% and 31.6%. It
also reduces runtime by up to 22.4% and cuts energy per correct decision by
40%-74%. The code is available at https://github.com/YuHao-Tian/SAEC.

TL;DR: 本文提出MD-Net双流架构，结合预训练扩散模型和视觉Mamba模型，解决面部美观预测中局部细节与全局结构的权衡问题，在SCUT-FBP5500基准上达到SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于CNN和ViT的面部美观预测模型存在固有架构偏差：CNN擅长局部特征提取但难以处理长距离依赖，ViT能建模全局关系但计算成本高。需要一种能同时兼顾局部美学细节和全局面部和谐性的方法。

Method: MD-Net采用双流架构：第一流使用预训练潜在扩散模型的冻结U-Net编码器，提供细粒度美学质量生成先验；第二流使用视觉Mamba模型，以线性时间复杂度高效捕获全局面部结构。通过交叉注意力机制协同整合两种互补表示。

Result: 在SCUT-FBP5500基准测试中，MD-Net实现了皮尔逊相关系数0.9235，创造了新的最先进水平。

Conclusion: MD-Net证明了融合生成模型和序列建模范式的混合架构在复杂视觉评估任务中的巨大潜力，成功解决了面部美观预测中的局部-全局权衡问题。

Abstract: The automated prediction of facial beauty is a benchmark task in affective
computing that requires a sophisticated understanding of both local aesthetic
details (e.g., skin texture) and global facial harmony (e.g., symmetry,
proportions). Existing models, based on either Convolutional Neural Networks
(CNNs) or Vision Transformers (ViTs), exhibit inherent architectural biases
that limit their performance; CNNs excel at local feature extraction but
struggle with long-range dependencies, while ViTs model global relationships at
a significant computational cost. This paper introduces the
\textbf{Mamba-Diffusion Network (MD-Net)}, a novel dual-stream architecture
that resolves this trade-off by delegating specialized roles to
state-of-the-art models. The first stream leverages a frozen U-Net encoder from
a pre-trained latent diffusion model, providing a powerful generative prior for
fine-grained aesthetic qualities. The second stream employs a Vision Mamba
(Vim), a modern state-space model, to efficiently capture global facial
structure with linear-time complexity. By synergistically integrating these
complementary representations through a cross-attention mechanism, MD-Net
creates a holistic and nuanced feature space for prediction. Evaluated on the
SCUT-FBP5500 benchmark, MD-Net sets a new state-of-the-art, achieving a Pearson
Correlation of \textbf{0.9235} and demonstrating the significant potential of
hybrid architectures that fuse generative and sequential modeling paradigms for
complex visual assessment tasks.

boundaries and mask variability. We introduce \emph{Segmentation Sch\"{o}dinger
Bridge (SSB)}, the first application of Sch\"{o}dinger Bridge for ambiguous
medical image segmentation, modelling joint image-mask dynamics to enhance
performance. SSB preserves structural integrity, delineates unclear boundaries
without additional guidance, and maintains diversity using a novel loss
function. We further propose the \emph{Diversity Divergence Index} ($D_{DDI}$)
to quantify inter-rater variability, capturing both diversity and consensus.

Motivation: 心血管疾病是全球主要死因，超声心动图对诊断至关重要，但某些病理数据稀缺限制了自动化诊断模型的开发。

Method: 在先进的回声视频生成器中引入病理条件机制，使模型能够学习和控制疾病特定的心脏结构和运动模式，生成针对房间隔缺损和肺动脉高压的超声视频。

Result: 合成视频具有高视觉保真度，分类器在合成数据上训练后能很好地泛化到真实数据，将真实训练集增强后分别将ASD和PAH的诊断准确率提高了7%和8%。

Conclusion: Echo-Path框架能有效生成逼真的病理特异性超声心动图视频，为数据稀缺的病理提供有价值的训练数据，显著提升下游诊断性能。

Abstract: Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) remain the leading cause of mortality
globally, and echocardiography is critical for diagnosis of both common and
congenital cardiac conditions. However, echocardiographic data for certain
pathologies are scarce, hindering the development of robust automated diagnosis
models. In this work, we propose Echo-Path, a novel generative framework to
produce echocardiogram videos conditioned on specific cardiac pathologies.
Echo-Path can synthesize realistic ultrasound video sequences that exhibit
targeted abnormalities, focusing here on atrial septal defect (ASD) and
pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). Our approach introduces a
pathology-conditioning mechanism into a state-of-the-art echo video generator,
allowing the model to learn and control disease-specific structural and motion
patterns in the heart. Quantitative evaluation demonstrates that the synthetic
videos achieve low distribution distances, indicating high visual fidelity.
Clinically, the generated echoes exhibit plausible pathology markers.
Furthermore, classifiers trained on our synthetic data generalize well to real
data and, when used to augment real training sets, it improves downstream
diagnosis of ASD and PAH by 7\% and 8\% respectively. Code, weights and dataset
are available here https://github.com/Marshall-mk/EchoPathv1

Conclusion: 验证了诊断引导、分类法条件化的奖励工程有效性，为未来研究提供了可重用资源

Abstract: Analyzing cultural-heritage artifacts remains challenging for MLLMs: general
models lack domain expertise, and SFT often overfits superficial patterns,
yielding brittle reasoning for authentication and historical attribution. This
raises the question of how to equip MLLMs with robust, expert-level reasoning
for ancient Greek pottery. We present VaseVL, an SFT-then-RL system that turns
evaluation into supervision: we construct a taxonomy of question types, probe
the SFT model to localize type-specific performance gaps, and optimize with
type-conditioned, compositionality-oriented rewards targeting those gaps. We
also release VaseVQA, a comprehensive benchmark of 31,773 images designed to
probe deep understanding. Experiments show state-of-the-art results on style
classification and historical attribution with marked gains in compositional
robustness over SFT-only baselines, validating diagnosis-guided,
taxonomy-conditioned reward engineering and providing a reusable resource for
future research. Code and dataset will be available at

Motivation: 现有生成方法主要捕获几何信息，语义信息通常通过外部分割或聚类后处理施加，而不是集成到生成过程本身。

Method: 扩散框架，每个点关联语义标签的条件变量，指导扩散动力学，实现几何和语义的联合合成。

Result: 通过对比分析有引导和无引导扩散过程，证明条件变量对扩散动力学和生成质量的显著影响。

Conclusion: 该方法能生成针对特定部件和特征的详细准确3D点云，验证了方法的有效性。

Abstract: Generating realistic 3D point clouds is a fundamental problem in computer
vision with applications in remote sensing, robotics, and digital object
modeling. Existing generative approaches primarily capture geometry, and when
semantics are considered, they are typically imposed post hoc through external
segmentation or clustering rather than integrated into the generative process
itself. We propose a diffusion-based framework that embeds per-point semantic
conditioning directly within generation. Each point is associated with a
conditional variable corresponding to its semantic label, which guides the
diffusion dynamics and enables the joint synthesis of geometry and semantics.
This design produces point clouds that are both structurally coherent and
segmentation-aware, with object parts explicitly represented during synthesis.
Through a comparative analysis of guided and unguided diffusion processes, we
demonstrate the significant impact of conditional variables on diffusion
dynamics and generation quality. Extensive experiments validate the efficacy of
our approach, producing detailed and accurate 3D point clouds tailored to
specific parts and features.

Method: 采用判别器-生成器架构，通过破坏点云令牌然后进行去噪的破坏-重建框架，替代传统的掩码重建任务。

Result: 在ShapeNet数据集上，重建误差比PointMAE降低93%以上，测试集Chamfer距离降低14倍以上；收敛更快，在ShapeNet、ModelNet10和ModelNet40基准测试中分类准确率更高。

Conclusion: Point-RTD在所有情况下都明显优于基线Point-MAE框架，证明了该方法在3D点云任务预训练中的有效性。

Abstract: Pre-training strategies play a critical role in advancing the performance of
transformer-based models for 3D point cloud tasks. In this paper, we introduce
Point-RTD (Replaced Token Denoising), a novel pretraining strategy designed to
improve token robustness through a corruption-reconstruction framework. Unlike
traditional mask-based reconstruction tasks that hide data segments for later
prediction, Point-RTD corrupts point cloud tokens and leverages a
discriminator-generator architecture for denoising. This shift enables more
effective learning of structural priors and significantly enhances model
performance and efficiency. On the ShapeNet dataset, Point-RTD reduces
reconstruction error by over 93% compared to PointMAE, and achieves more than
14x lower Chamfer Distance on the test set. Our method also converges faster
and yields higher classification accuracy on ShapeNet, ModelNet10, and
ModelNet40 benchmarks, clearly outperforming the baseline Point-MAE framework
in every case.

Abstract: This paper proposes a Diffusion Model-Optimized Neural Radiance Field
(DT-NeRF) method, aimed at enhancing detail recovery and multi-view consistency
in 3D scene reconstruction. By combining diffusion models with Transformers,
DT-NeRF effectively restores details under sparse viewpoints and maintains high

Conclusion: 该方法通过消除对地面真实位姿的依赖，提供了更好的可扩展性，能够利用更大规模的数据集，为无监督3D重建开辟了新途径

Abstract: We introduce SPFSplatV2, an efficient feed-forward framework for 3D Gaussian
splatting from sparse multi-view images, requiring no ground-truth poses during
training and inference. It employs a shared feature extraction backbone,
enabling simultaneous prediction of 3D Gaussian primitives and camera poses in
a canonical space from unposed inputs. A masked attention mechanism is
introduced to efficiently estimate target poses during training, while a
reprojection loss enforces pixel-aligned Gaussian primitives, providing
stronger geometric constraints. We further demonstrate the compatibility of our
training framework with different reconstruction architectures, resulting in
two model variants. Remarkably, despite the absence of pose supervision, our
method achieves state-of-the-art performance in both in-domain and
out-of-domain novel view synthesis, even under extreme viewpoint changes and
limited image overlap, and surpasses recent methods that rely on geometric
supervision for relative pose estimation. By eliminating dependence on
ground-truth poses, our method offers the scalability to leverage larger and
more diverse datasets. Code and pretrained models will be available on our
project page: https://ranrhuang.github.io/spfsplatv2/.

Abstract: Efficient data compression is crucial for the storage and transmission of
visual data. However, in facial expression recognition (FER) tasks, lossy
compression often leads to feature degradation and reduced accuracy. To address
these challenges, this study proposes an end-to-end model designed to preserve
critical features and enhance both compression and recognition performance. A
custom loss function is introduced to optimize the model, tailored to balance
compression and recognition performance effectively. This study also examines
the influence of varying loss term weights on this balance. Experimental
results indicate that fine-tuning the compression model alone improves
classification accuracy by 0.71% and compression efficiency by 49.32%, while
joint optimization achieves significant gains of 4.04% in accuracy and 89.12%
in efficiency. Moreover, the findings demonstrate that the jointly optimized
classification model maintains high accuracy on both compressed and
uncompressed data, while the compression model reliably preserves image
details, even at high compression rates.

*Xiangmin Xu,Zhen Meng,Kan Chen,Jiaming Yang,Emma Li,Philip G. Zhao,David Flynn*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于上下文多臂老虎机PPO框架的实时3D场景表示方法，通过结合信息年龄和语义信息来优化图像选择，在动态环境中平衡数据新鲜度和表示质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实时3D场景表示是数字制造、VR/AR/MR和元宇宙等前沿应用的基础要素。尽管实时通信和计算技术有所进步，但在3D场景表示中实现时效性和保真度之间的平衡仍然是一个挑战。

Method: 提出了一种上下文多臂老虎机近端策略优化框架，结合信息年龄和语义信息来优化图像选择。评估了两种策略（ω-阈值和ω-等待策略）以及两种基准方法（时效嵌入和加权求和），在标准数据集和基线3D场景表示模型上进行测试。

Conclusion: 这项工作通过在动态环境中优化时效性和保真度之间的权衡，推进了实时3D场景表示技术的发展。

Abstract: Real-time Three-dimensional (3D) scene representation is a foundational
element that supports a broad spectrum of cutting-edge applications, including
digital manufacturing, Virtual, Augmented, and Mixed Reality (VR/AR/MR), and
the emerging metaverse. Despite advancements in real-time communication and
computing, achieving a balance between timeliness and fidelity in 3D scene
representation remains a challenge. This work investigates a wireless network
where multiple homogeneous mobile robots, equipped with cameras, capture an
environment and transmit images to an edge server over channels for 3D
representation. We propose a contextual-bandit Proximal Policy Optimization
(PPO) framework incorporating both Age of Information (AoI) and semantic
information to optimize image selection for representation, balancing data
freshness and representation quality. Two policies -- the $\omega$-threshold
and $\omega$-wait policies -- together with two benchmark methods are
evaluated, timeliness embedding and weighted sum, on standard datasets and
baseline 3D scene representation models. Experimental results demonstrate
improved representation fidelity while maintaining low latency, offering
insight into the model's decision-making process. This work advances real-time
3D scene representation by optimizing the trade-off between timeliness and
fidelity in dynamic environments.

Motivation: 建筑合规检查中设施类型和空间分布的准确枚举是关键但被忽视的问题，手动操作耗时耗力，需要自动化解决方案

Method: 提出集成门检测与LLM推理的新方法，首次将LLMs应用于该任务，并通过思维链（CoT）管道提升性能

Result: 在真实世界和合成平面图数据上的实验表明该方法具有有效性和鲁棒性，能很好地泛化到不同数据集和设施类型

Conclusion: 该方法为建筑合规检查的自动化提供了新的解决方案，填补了现有工作流中的关键空白

Abstract: Building compliance checking (BCC) is a critical process for ensuring that
constructed facilities meet regulatory standards. A core component of BCC is
the accurate enumeration of facility types and their spatial distribution.
Despite its importance, this problem has been largely overlooked in the
literature, posing a significant challenge for BCC and leaving a critical gap
in existing workflows. Performing this task manually is time-consuming and
labor-intensive. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) offer new
opportunities to enhance automation by combining visual recognition with
reasoning capabilities. In this paper, we introduce a new task for BCC:
automated facility enumeration, which involves validating the quantity of each
facility type against statutory requirements. To address it, we propose a novel
method that integrates door detection with LLM-based reasoning. We are the
first to apply LLMs to this task and further enhance their performance through
a Chain-of-Thought (CoT) pipeline. Our approach generalizes well across diverse
datasets and facility types. Experiments on both real-world and synthetic floor
plan data demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our method.

### [124] [DepTR-MOT: Unveiling the Potential of Depth-Informed Trajectory Refinement for Multi-Object Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17323)
*Buyin Deng,Lingxin Huang,Kai Luo,Fei Teng,Kailun Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DepTR-MOT是一个基于DETR的多目标跟踪方法，通过引入实例级深度信息来解决遮挡和近距离交互问题，在机器人环境中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多目标跟踪方法主要依赖2D线索（如边界框和运动建模），在遮挡和近距离交互场景下表现不佳。深度信息有潜力解决这些问题，但大多数MOT数据集缺乏深度标注，导致深度信息在领域中被低估。

Method: 提出DepTR-MOT，基于DETR的检测器，包含两个关键创新：(1)基于基础模型的实例级软深度标签监督，用于优化深度预测；(2)密集深度图的蒸馏，以保持全局深度一致性。这些策略使模型能在推理时输出实例级深度，无需基础模型且不增加计算成本。

Result: 在QuadTrack和DanceTrack数据集上的实验表明，该方法分别达到27.59和44.47的HOTA分数。特别是在机器人平台数据集QuadTrack上，该方法在处理遮挡和近距离挑战方面表现出明显优势。

Conclusion: 通过引入深度线索，DepTR-MOT增强了TBD范式的鲁棒性，有效解决了遮挡和近距离交互问题，特别适用于机器人环境中的多目标跟踪任务。

Abstract: Visual Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) is a crucial component of robotic
perception, yet existing Tracking-By-Detection (TBD) methods often rely on 2D
cues, such as bounding boxes and motion modeling, which struggle under
occlusions and close-proximity interactions. Trackers relying on these 2D cues
are particularly unreliable in robotic environments, where dense targets and
frequent occlusions are common. While depth information has the potential to
alleviate these issues, most existing MOT datasets lack depth annotations,
leading to its underexploited role in the domain. To unveil the potential of
depth-informed trajectory refinement, we introduce DepTR-MOT, a DETR-based
detector enhanced with instance-level depth information. Specifically, we
propose two key innovations: (i) foundation model-based instance-level soft
depth label supervision, which refines depth prediction, and (ii) the
distillation of dense depth maps to maintain global depth consistency. These
strategies enable DepTR-MOT to output instance-level depth during inference,
without requiring foundation models and without additional computational cost.
By incorporating depth cues, our method enhances the robustness of the TBD
paradigm, effectively resolving occlusion and close-proximity challenges.
Experiments on both the QuadTrack and DanceTrack datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach, achieving HOTA scores of 27.59 and 44.47,
respectively. In particular, results on QuadTrack, a robotic platform MOT
dataset, highlight the advantages of our method in handling occlusion and
close-proximity challenges in robotic tracking. The source code will be made
publicly available at https://github.com/warriordby/DepTR-MOT.

Conclusion: UIPro方法有效解决了通用GUI代理开发中的关键问题，展示了强大的GUI交互能力

Abstract: Building autonomous agents that perceive and operate graphical user
interfaces (GUIs) like humans has long been a vision in the field of artificial
intelligence. Central to these agents is the capability for GUI interaction,
which involves GUI understanding and planning capabilities. Existing methods
have tried developing GUI agents based on the multi-modal comprehension ability
of vision-language models (VLMs). However, the limited scenario, insufficient
size, and heterogeneous action spaces hinder the progress of building
generalist GUI agents. To resolve these issues, this paper proposes
\textbf{UIPro}, a novel generalist GUI agent trained with extensive
multi-platform and multi-task GUI interaction data, coupled with a unified
action space. We first curate a comprehensive dataset encompassing 20.6 million
GUI understanding tasks to pre-train UIPro, granting it a strong GUI grounding
capability, which is key to downstream GUI agent tasks. Subsequently, we
establish a unified action space to harmonize heterogeneous GUI agent task
datasets and produce a merged dataset to foster the action prediction ability
of UIPro via continued fine-tuning. Experimental results demonstrate UIPro's
superior performance across multiple GUI task benchmarks on various platforms,
highlighting the effectiveness of our approach.

TL;DR: SmokeSeer是一种从视频中同时进行3D场景重建和烟雾去除的方法，利用热成像和RGB图像，通过3D高斯泼溅技术将场景分解为烟雾和非烟雾成分，能够处理各种烟雾密度和时变烟雾。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的烟雾会严重降低图像质量并阻碍可见性。现有的图像恢复方法要么依赖容易产生幻觉的数据驱动先验，要么仅限于静态低密度烟雾。

Method: 基于3D高斯泼溅技术，融合热成像和RGB图像信息，利用热成像中散射减少的特性透过烟雾观察场景，并将场景显式分解为烟雾和非烟雾成分。

Result: 在合成数据和真实世界多视角烟雾数据集上验证了方法的有效性，能够处理广泛的烟雾密度和时变烟雾。

Conclusion: SmokeSeer提供了一种同时进行3D重建和烟雾去除的有效解决方案，优于现有方法，并提供了开源代码和数据集。

Abstract: Smoke in real-world scenes can severely degrade the quality of images and
hamper visibility. Recent methods for image restoration either rely on
data-driven priors that are susceptible to hallucinations, or are limited to
static low-density smoke. We introduce SmokeSeer, a method for simultaneous 3D
scene reconstruction and smoke removal from a video capturing multiple views of
a scene. Our method uses thermal and RGB images, leveraging the fact that the
reduced scattering in thermal images enables us to see through the smoke. We
build upon 3D Gaussian splatting to fuse information from the two image
modalities, and decompose the scene explicitly into smoke and non-smoke
components. Unlike prior approaches, SmokeSeer handles a broad range of smoke
densities and can adapt to temporally varying smoke. We validate our approach
on synthetic data and introduce a real-world multi-view smoke dataset with RGB
and thermal images. We provide open-source code and data at the project
website.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的卷积神经网络（CNN）和长短期记忆网络（LSTM）在图像描述任务中存在训练速度慢、难以处理长序列信息的问题。Transformer的自注意力机制能够更好地捕捉数据中的短程和长程依赖关系。

Method: 采用Transformer架构，结合EfficientNetB0 CNN进行特征提取，在Flickr30k数据集上进行数据预处理和模型训练，并引入注意力机制。

Result: 该方法实现了高效的并行化训练和推理，解决了传统序列模型的局限性。

Conclusion: Transformer模型在图像描述任务中表现出色，通过自注意力机制和并行化处理，显著提升了训练效率和模型性能。

Abstract: Automatic image captioning, a multifaceted task bridging computer vision and
natural lan- guage processing, aims to generate descriptive textual content
from visual input. While Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Long
Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks have achieved significant advancements, they
present limitations. The inherent sequential nature of RNNs leads to sluggish
training and inference times. LSTMs further struggle with retaining information
from earlier sequence elements when dealing with very long se- quences. This
project presents a comprehensive guide to constructing and comprehending
transformer models for image captioning. Transformers employ self-attention
mechanisms, capturing both short- and long-range dependencies within the data.
This facilitates efficient parallelization during both training and inference
phases. We leverage the well-established Transformer architecture, recognized
for its effectiveness in managing sequential data, and present a meticulous
methodology. Utilizing the Flickr30k dataset, we conduct data pre- processing,
construct a model architecture that integrates an EfficientNetB0 CNN for fea-
ture extraction, and train the model with attention mechanisms incorporated.
Our approach exemplifies the utilization of parallelization for efficient
training and inference. You can find the project on GitHub.

TL;DR: 本文通过稀疏自编码器分析ViT的6.6K特征，提出残差替换模型来简化ViT计算，揭示特征从低层模式到高层语义的演化过程，并展示了在消除虚假相关性方面的应用价值。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解视觉变换器（ViTs）如何表示和处理世界是一个长期存在的问题，需要系统性地分析其内部特征表示和计算机制。

Method: 使用稀疏自编码器提取所有层的6.6K特征，引入残差替换模型将ViT计算替换为可解释的特征表示，从而简化原始计算过程。

Result: 分析揭示了特征从低层模式到高层语义的演化过程，发现ViT通过专门的特征类型编码曲线和空间位置，残差替换模型能够产生忠实且简洁的可解释电路。

Conclusion: 该框架能够直观理解ViT机制，并在消除虚假相关性方面展示了实用价值，为ViT的可解释性研究提供了有效工具。

Abstract: How do vision transformers (ViTs) represent and process the world? This paper
addresses this long-standing question through the first systematic analysis of
6.6K features across all layers, extracted via sparse autoencoders, and by
introducing the residual replacement model, which replaces ViT computations
with interpretable features in the residual stream. Our analysis reveals not
only a feature evolution from low-level patterns to high-level semantics, but
also how ViTs encode curves and spatial positions through specialized feature
types. The residual replacement model scalably produces a faithful yet
parsimonious circuit for human-scale interpretability by significantly
simplifying the original computations. As a result, this framework enables
intuitive understanding of ViT mechanisms. Finally, we demonstrate the utility
of our framework in debiasing spurious correlations.

TL;DR: 本文首次系统评估了六种预训练骨干网络（CLIP、SigLIP2、DINOv2、DINOv3、Perception、ResNet）在无参考图像质量评估任务中的表现，发现SigLIP2表现优异且激活函数选择对模型泛化能力至关重要。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大规模视觉语言预训练在无参考图像质量评估中显示出潜力，但现代Vision Transformer基础的相对优势尚不明确，需要系统评估不同预训练骨干网络的表现。

Method: 使用相同的轻量级MLP头对六种预训练骨干网络进行微调，并引入可学习的激活选择机制来自适应确定每个通道的非线性函数。

Result: SigLIP2表现稳定优异，sigmoid激活函数在多个基准测试中优于常用的ReLU和GELU。提出的自适应激活选择机制在CLIVE、KADID10K和AGIQA3K数据集上达到了新的最先进SRCC性能。

Conclusion: 激活函数选择对图像质量评估模型的泛化能力具有关键影响，提出的自适应机制消除了手动设计激活函数的需求，建立了强大且资源高效的NR-IQA基线。

Abstract: Large-scale vision language pre-training has recently shown promise for
no-reference image-quality assessment (NR-IQA), yet the relative merits of
modern Vision Transformer foundations remain poorly understood. In this work,
we present the first systematic evaluation of six prominent pretrained
backbones, CLIP, SigLIP2, DINOv2, DINOv3, Perception, and ResNet, for the task
of No-Reference Image Quality Assessment (NR-IQA), each finetuned using an
identical lightweight MLP head. Our study uncovers two previously overlooked
factors: (1) SigLIP2 consistently achieves strong performance; and (2) the
choice of activation function plays a surprisingly crucial role, particularly
for enhancing the generalization ability of image quality assessment models.
Notably, we find that simple sigmoid activations outperform commonly used ReLU
and GELU on several benchmarks. Motivated by this finding, we introduce a
learnable activation selection mechanism that adaptively determines the
nonlinearity for each channel, eliminating the need for manual activation
design, and achieving new state-of-the-art SRCC on CLIVE, KADID10K, and
AGIQA3K. Extensive ablations confirm the benefits across architectures and
regimes, establishing strong, resource-efficient NR-IQA baselines.

Abstract: Indonesia's marine ecosystems, part of the globally recognized Coral
Triangle, are among the richest in biodiversity, requiring efficient monitoring
tools to support conservation. Traditional fish detection methods are
time-consuming and demand expert knowledge, prompting the need for automated
solutions. This study explores the implementation of YOLOv10-nano, a
state-of-the-art deep learning model, for real-time marine fish detection in
Indonesian waters, using test data from Bunaken National Marine Park. YOLOv10's

while maintaining low computational demand (2.7M parameters, 8.4 GFLOPs). It
also delivered an average inference speed of 29.29 FPS on the CPU, making it
suitable for real-time deployment. Although OpenImages V7-Fish alone provided
lower accuracy, it complemented DeepFish in enhancing model robustness.
Overall, this study demonstrates YOLOv10-nano's potential for efficient,

Abstract: Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) are vital for reliable urban
positioning. However, multipath and non-line-of-sight reception often introduce
large measurement errors that degrade accuracy. Learning-based methods for
predicting and compensating pseudorange errors have gained traction, but their
performance is limited by complex error distributions. To address this
challenge, we propose Diff-GNSS, a coarse-to-fine GNSS measurement
(pseudorange) error estimation framework that leverages a conditional diffusion
model to capture such complex distributions. Firstly, a Mamba-based module
performs coarse estimation to provide an initial prediction with appropriate
scale and trend. Then, a conditional denoising diffusion layer refines the
estimate, enabling fine-grained modeling of pseudorange errors. To suppress
uncontrolled generative diversity and achieve controllable synthesis, three key
features related to GNSS measurement quality are used as conditions to
precisely guide the reverse denoising process. We further incorporate
per-satellite uncertainty modeling within the diffusion stage to assess the
reliability of the predicted errors. We have collected and publicly released a
real-world dataset covering various scenes. Experiments on public and
self-collected datasets show that DiffGNSS consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines across multiple metrics. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first application of diffusion models to pseudorange
error estimation. The proposed diffusion-based refinement module is
plug-and-play and can be readily integrated into existing networks to markedly
improve estimation accuracy.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于视觉语言基础模型（如CLIP）的通用域自适应方法，专注于标签空间对齐而非视觉空间对齐，通过生成式视觉语言模型识别目标域中的未知类别，并构建通用分类器来提升域适应性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的通用域自适应方法主要关注视觉空间对齐，但由于内容差异导致的视觉模糊性，其鲁棒性和泛化能力有限。本文旨在利用视觉语言基础模型的零样本能力，通过标签空间对齐来增强适应稳定性。

Method: 首先使用生成式视觉语言模型识别目标域中的未知类别；然后提出无需训练标签空间对齐方法，通过过滤和精炼域间噪声标签来对齐标签空间；最后构建集成共享知识和目标私有类信息的通用分类器。

Result: 在DomainBed基准测试中，该方法显著优于现有通用域自适应技术，H-score平均提升7.9%，H³-score平均提升6.1%。结合自训练后，H-score和H³-score进一步提升了1.6%。

Conclusion: 通过专注于标签空间对齐而非视觉空间对齐，该方法有效提升了通用域自适应的性能，证明了视觉语言基础模型在域自适应任务中的潜力。

Abstract: Universal domain adaptation (UniDA) transfers knowledge from a labeled source
domain to an unlabeled target domain, where label spaces may differ and the
target domain may contain private classes. Previous UniDA methods primarily
focused on visual space alignment but often struggled with visual ambiguities
due to content differences, which limited their robustness and
generalizability. To overcome this, we introduce a novel approach that
leverages the strong \textit{zero-shot capabilities} of recent vision-language
foundation models (VLMs) like CLIP, concentrating solely on label space
alignment to enhance adaptation stability. CLIP can generate task-specific
classifiers based only on label names. However, adapting CLIP to UniDA is
challenging because the label space is not fully known in advance. In this
study, we first utilize generative vision-language models to identify unknown
categories in the target domain. Noise and semantic ambiguities in the
discovered labels -- such as those similar to source labels (e.g., synonyms,
hypernyms, hyponyms) -- complicate label alignment. To address this, we propose
a training-free label-space alignment method for UniDA (\ours). Our method
aligns label spaces instead of visual spaces by filtering and refining noisy
labels between the domains. We then construct a \textit{universal classifier}
that integrates both shared knowledge and target-private class information,
thereby improving generalizability under domain shifts. The results reveal that
the proposed method considerably outperforms existing UniDA techniques across
key DomainBed benchmarks, delivering an average improvement of
\textcolor{blue}{+7.9\%}in H-score and \textcolor{blue}{+6.1\%} in H$^3$-score.
Furthermore, incorporating self-training further enhances performance and
achieves an additional (\textcolor{blue}{+1.6\%}) increment in both H- and
H$^3$-scores.

Motivation: 传统离焦深度重建方法依赖手工先验，而基于U-Net的回归方法需要配对训练数据且受限于特定相机配置。本文旨在开发一种无需配对训练数据、不依赖特定相机配置的鲁棒深度重建方法

Method: 使用学习扩散先验作为正则化的优化框架，通过可微分前向模型保证测量一致性，在去噪图像域中引导解，结合了优化方法和学习先验的优势

Result: 在综合仿真和原型相机实验中，该方法在不同噪声水平下均表现出色，优于U-Net基线和经典编码孔径离焦深度方法

Conclusion: 该方法成功将扩散先验作为纯正则化器应用于深度重建任务，实现了无需配对训练数据、相机配置无关的鲁棒RGBD重建

Abstract: We propose a single-snapshot depth-from-defocus (DFD) reconstruction method
for coded-aperture imaging that replaces hand-crafted priors with a learned
diffusion prior used purely as regularization. Our optimization framework
enforces measurement consistency via a differentiable forward model while
guiding solutions with the diffusion prior in the denoised image domain,
yielding higher accuracy and stability than clas- sical optimization. Unlike
U-Net-style regressors, our approach requires no paired defocus-RGBD training
data and does not tie training to a specific camera configuration. Experiments
on comprehensive simulations and a prototype camera demonstrate consistently
strong RGBD reconstructions across noise levels, outperforming both U-Net
baselines and a classical coded- aperture DFD method.

Motivation: 当前对抗技术采用通用方法而非针对个体面部特征，限制了其有效性和隐蔽性。面部识别系统的普及带来了重大隐私风险，需要有效的应对措施。

Method: 引入LEAM技术，结合面部解析器分析9个预训练面部识别模型在1000个个体上的数据，识别个体层面的关键识别区域。

Conclusion: 研究结果为未来基于LEAM选择扰动区域的个性化隐私保护系统奠定了基础，证实了存在个体特定的识别模式。

Abstract: The proliferation of facial recognition systems presents major privacy risks,
driving the need for effective countermeasures. Current adversarial techniques
apply generalized methods rather than adapting to individual facial
characteristics, limiting their effectiveness and inconspicuousness. In this
work, we introduce Layer Embedding Activation Mapping (LEAM), a novel technique
that identifies which facial areas contribute most to recognition at an
individual level. Unlike adversarial attack methods that aim to fool
recognition systems, LEAM is an explainability technique designed to understand
how these systems work, providing insights that could inform future privacy
protection research. We integrate LEAM with a face parser to analyze data from
1000 individuals across 9 pre-trained facial recognition models.
  Our analysis reveals that while different layers within facial recognition
models vary significantly in their focus areas, these models generally
prioritize similar facial regions across architectures when considering their
overall activation patterns, which show significantly higher similarity between
images of the same individual (Bhattacharyya Coefficient: 0.32-0.57) vs.
different individuals (0.04-0.13), validating the existence of person-specific
recognition patterns. Our results show that facial recognition models
prioritize the central region of face images (with nose areas accounting for
18.9-29.7% of critical recognition regions), while still distributing attention
across multiple facial fragments. Proper selection of relevant facial areas was
confirmed using validation occlusions, based on just 1% of the most relevant,
LEAM-identified, image pixels, which proved to be transferable across different
models. Our findings establish the foundation for future individually tailored
privacy protection systems centered around LEAM's choice of areas to be
perturbed.

Abstract: Accurate temporal prediction is the bridge between comprehensive scene
understanding and embodied artificial intelligence. However, predicting
multiple fine-grained states of a scene at multiple temporal scales is
difficult for vision-language models. We formalize the Multi-Scale Temporal
Prediction (MSTP) task in general and surgical scenes by decomposing
multi-scale into two orthogonal dimensions: the temporal scale, forecasting
states of humans and surgery at varying look-ahead intervals, and the state
scale, modeling a hierarchy of states in general and surgical scenes. For
example, in general scenes, states of contact relationships are finer-grained
than states of spatial relationships. In surgical scenes, medium-level steps
are finer-grained than high-level phases yet remain constrained by their
encompassing phase. To support this unified task, we introduce the first MSTP
Benchmark, featuring synchronized annotations across multiple state scales and
temporal scales. We further propose a method, Incremental Generation and
Multi-agent Collaboration (IG-MC), which integrates two key innovations. First,
we present a plug-and-play incremental generation module that continuously
synthesizes up-to-date visual previews at expanding temporal scales to inform
multiple decision-making agents, keeping decisions and generated visuals
synchronized and preventing performance degradation as look-ahead intervals
lengthen. Second, we present a decision-driven multi-agent collaboration
framework for multi-state prediction, comprising generation, initiation, and
multi-state assessment agents that dynamically trigger and evaluate prediction
cycles to balance global coherence and local fidelity.

Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型在图表理解中存在严重幻觉问题，但现有研究对图表理解中的幻觉现象关注不足，需要专门的基准来评估和解决这一问题。

Method: 提出了ChartHal基准，包含细粒度的幻觉场景分类和人工验证的数据集，对包括GPT-5和o4-mini在内的先进LVLMs进行系统性评估。

Result: 评估结果显示当前最先进的LVLMs在ChartHal上表现较差，GPT-5和o4-mini的准确率分别仅为34.46%和22.79%，涉及图表中缺失或矛盾信息的问题更容易引发幻觉。

Conclusion: 图表理解中的幻觉问题亟待解决，需要开发更强大的缓解策略，ChartHal基准为相关研究提供了重要工具。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have recently demonstrated remarkable
progress, yet hallucination remains a critical barrier, particularly in chart
understanding, which requires sophisticated perceptual and cognitive abilities
as well as rigorous factual accuracy. While prior work has investigated
hallucinations and chart comprehension independently, their intersection
remains largely unexplored. To address this gap, we present ChartHal, a
benchmark that features a fine-grained taxonomy of hallucination scenarios in
chart understanding, along with a human-validated dataset of 1,062 samples. Our
evaluation shows that state-of-the-art LVLMs suffer from severe hallucinations
on ChartHal, including proprietary models such as GPT-5 and o4-mini, which
achieve only 34.46% and 22.79% accuracy, respectively. Further analysis reveals
that questions involving information absent from or contradictory to charts are
especially likely to trigger hallucinations, underscoring the urgent need for
more robust mitigation strategies. Code and data are available at

TL;DR: EmbodiedSplat提出了一种通过3D高斯泼溅技术重建部署环境来个性化策略训练的方法，显著提升了模拟到现实的迁移效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前Embodied AI领域主要依赖仿真训练，但合成环境缺乏真实感，而高保真实世界重建成本高昂，导致模拟到现实的迁移成为主要挑战。

Method: 利用iPhone捕获部署场景，通过3D高斯泼溅技术重建网格，在Habitat-Sim模拟器中训练策略，使训练环境更接近真实世界条件。

Result: 实验表明，使用EmbodiedSplat微调的智能体在真实世界图像导航任务上比基于大规模真实数据集和合成数据集的零样本基线分别提高了20%和40%的成功率，模拟与真实相关性达到0.87-0.97。

Conclusion: 该方法能够以最小成本有效适应不同环境，为模拟到现实迁移提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: The field of Embodied AI predominantly relies on simulation for training and
evaluation, often using either fully synthetic environments that lack
photorealism or high-fidelity real-world reconstructions captured with
expensive hardware. As a result, sim-to-real transfer remains a major
challenge. In this paper, we introduce EmbodiedSplat, a novel approach that
personalizes policy training by efficiently capturing the deployment
environment and fine-tuning policies within the reconstructed scenes. Our
method leverages 3D Gaussian Splatting (GS) and the Habitat-Sim simulator to
bridge the gap between realistic scene capture and effective training
environments. Using iPhone-captured deployment scenes, we reconstruct meshes
via GS, enabling training in settings that closely approximate real-world
conditions. We conduct a comprehensive analysis of training strategies,
pre-training datasets, and mesh reconstruction techniques, evaluating their
impact on sim-to-real predictivity in real-world scenarios. Experimental
results demonstrate that agents fine-tuned with EmbodiedSplat outperform both
zero-shot baselines pre-trained on large-scale real-world datasets (HM3D) and
synthetically generated datasets (HSSD), achieving absolute success rate
improvements of 20\% and 40\% on real-world Image Navigation task. Moreover,
our approach yields a high sim-vs-real correlation (0.87--0.97) for the
reconstructed meshes, underscoring its effectiveness in adapting policies to
diverse environments with minimal effort. Project page:

Motivation: 临床诊断中多模态病理图像常见，但基于计算机视觉的多模态图像辅助诊断面临模态融合挑战，特别是在缺乏专家标注数据的情况下。

Method: 提出协同学习预训练框架（一致性、重构和对齐学习），将一种模态视为另一种模态的增强样本进行自监督预训练；设计微调方法，为原始模态设置不同编码器，并提供多模态融合编码器；提出多模态融合特征的分布偏移方法。

Result: 在公开胃镜图像数据集Kvasir和Kvasirv2上的实验表明，该方法优于当前最先进的分类方法。

Conclusion: 该方法能有效实现标签稀缺情况下的多模态图像融合，提升医学图像分类性能。

Abstract: Multimodal pathological images are usually in clinical diagnosis, but
computer vision-based multimodal image-assisted diagnosis faces challenges with
modality fusion, especially in the absence of expert-annotated data. To achieve
the modality fusion in multimodal images with label scarcity, we propose a
novel ``pretraining + fine-tuning" framework for multimodal semi-supervised
medical image classification. Specifically, we propose a synergistic learning
pretraining framework of consistency, reconstructive, and aligned learning. By
treating one modality as an augmented sample of another modality, we implement
a self-supervised learning pre-train, enhancing the baseline model's feature
representation capability. Then, we design a fine-tuning method for multimodal
fusion. During the fine-tuning stage, we set different encoders to extract
features from the original modalities and provide a multimodal fusion encoder
for fusion modality. In addition, we propose a distribution shift method for
multimodal fusion features, which alleviates the prediction uncertainty and
overfitting risks caused by the lack of labeled samples. We conduct extensive
experiments on the publicly available gastroscopy image datasets Kvasir and
Kvasirv2. Quantitative and qualitative results demonstrate that the proposed
method outperforms the current state-of-the-art classification methods. The

Abstract: This paper presents a new approach to estimate accurate and robust 3D
semantic correspondence with the hierarchical neural semantic representation.
Our work has three key contributions. First, we design the hierarchical neural
semantic representation (HNSR), which consists of a global semantic feature to
capture high-level structure and multi-resolution local geometric features to
preserve fine details, by carefully harnessing 3D priors from pre-trained 3D
generative models. Second, we design a progressive global-to-local matching
strategy, which establishes coarse semantic correspondence using the global
semantic feature, then iteratively refines it with local geometric features,
yielding accurate and semantically-consistent mappings. Third, our framework is
training-free and broadly compatible with various pre-trained 3D generative
backbones, demonstrating strong generalization across diverse shape categories.
Our method also supports various applications, such as shape co-segmentation,
keypoint matching, and texture transfer, and generalizes well to structurally
diverse shapes, with promising results even in cross-category scenarios. Both
qualitative and quantitative evaluations show that our method outperforms
previous state-of-the-art techniques.

TL;DR: 本文首次全面评估了YOLOv8-YOLOv12在六种模拟水下环境中的鲁棒性，发现YOLOv12性能最强但对噪声敏感，噪声会破坏边缘和纹理特征。类不平衡是主要挑战，图像数量和实例频率主导检测性能。提出了噪声感知样本注入和高级增强微调两种轻量级策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 水下物体检测面临严重的水下失真问题，即使最先进的检测器也受到影响。目前缺乏对YOLO模型在水下恶劣条件下鲁棒性的系统性研究，需要验证YOLO模型在水下混沌环境中的真实性能。

Method: 使用DUO和Roboflow100的统一数据集（10,000张标注图像），在六种模拟水下环境中评估YOLOv8-YOLOv12变体。分析失真对纹理、边缘和颜色等低层特征的影响，并评估噪声感知样本注入和高级增强微调两种轻量级训练策略。

Result: YOLOv12整体性能最强但对噪声高度敏感；噪声会破坏边缘和纹理特征；类不平衡中图像数量和实例频率是检测性能的主要驱动因素；噪声感知样本注入提高了噪声和真实环境下的鲁棒性；高级增强微调在增强域中提升精度但在原始数据中略有下降。

Conclusion: 研究结果为构建弹性和成本效益高的水下物体检测系统提供了实用指导，展示了轻量级训练策略在领域适应方面的强大潜力。

Abstract: Underwater object detection (UOD) remains a critical challenge in computer
vision due to underwater distortions which degrade low-level features and
compromise the reliability of even state-of-the-art detectors. While YOLO
models have become the backbone of real-time object detection, little work has
systematically examined their robustness under these uniquely challenging
conditions. This raises a critical question: Are YOLO models genuinely robust
when operating under the chaotic and unpredictable conditions of underwater
environments? In this study, we present one of the first comprehensive
evaluations of recent YOLO variants (YOLOv8-YOLOv12) across six simulated
underwater environments. Using a unified dataset of 10,000 annotated images
from DUO and Roboflow100, we not only benchmark model robustness but also
analyze how distortions affect key low-level features such as texture, edges,
and color. Our findings show that (1) YOLOv12 delivers the strongest overall
performance but is highly vulnerable to noise, and (2) noise disrupts edge and
texture features, explaining the poor detection performance in noisy images.
Class imbalance is a persistent challenge in UOD. Experiments revealed that (3)
image counts and instance frequency primarily drive detection performance,
while object appearance exerts only a secondary influence. Finally, we
evaluated lightweight training-aware strategies: noise-aware sample injection,
which improves robustness in both noisy and real-world conditions, and
fine-tuning with advanced enhancement, which boosts accuracy in enhanced
domains but slightly lowers performance in original data, demonstrating strong
potential for domain adaptation, respectively. Together, these insights provide
practical guidance for building resilient and cost-efficient UOD systems.

<details>

Motivation: 帕金森病自动诊断具有重要临床需求，但缺乏大规模高质量数据集导致模型容易过拟合。现有3D医学模型预训练面临体素间距和模态不匹配的问题。

Method: 从NM和QSM图像中裁剪多个关键ROI，通过独立分支处理每个ROI，使用2D VFMs编码3D ROI体积的轴向切片，并通过辅助分割头引导特征提取。引入多ROI监督对比学习提升诊断性能。

Result: 在仅300个标记QSM和NM-MRI扫描的数据集上训练，准确率达到86.0%，在MICCAI 2025 PDCADxFoundation挑战赛中排名第一，比第二名方法高出5.5%。

Conclusion: 该方法展示了2D VFMs在3D MR图像临床分析中的潜力，为小样本医学图像诊断提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The automatic diagnosis of Parkinson's disease is in high clinical demand due
to its prevalence and the importance of targeted treatment. Current clinical
practice often relies on diagnostic biomarkers in QSM and NM-MRI images.
However, the lack of large, high-quality datasets makes training diagnostic
models from scratch prone to overfitting. Adapting pre-trained 3D medical
models is also challenging, as the diversity of medical imaging leads to
mismatches in voxel spacing and modality between pre-training and fine-tuning
data. In this paper, we address these challenges by leveraging 2D vision
foundation models (VFMs). Specifically, we crop multiple key ROIs from NM and
QSM images, process each ROI through separate branches to compress the ROI into
a token, and then combine these tokens into a unified patient representation
for classification. Within each branch, we use 2D VFMs to encode axial slices
of the 3D ROI volume and fuse them into the ROI token, guided by an auxiliary
segmentation head that steers the feature extraction toward specific brain
nuclei. Additionally, we introduce multi-ROI supervised contrastive learning,
which improves diagnostic performance by pulling together representations of
patients from the same class while pushing away those from different classes.
Our approach achieved first place in the MICCAI 2025 PDCADxFoundation
challenge, with an accuracy of 86.0% trained on a dataset of only 300 labeled
QSM and NM-MRI scans, outperforming the second-place method by 5.5%.These
results highlight the potential of 2D VFMs for clinical analysis of 3D MR
images.

<details>

Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型中图像到文本的信息流机制难以解释，因为众多注意力头同时运作，需要开发方法来识别关键注意力头模式

Method: 提出head attribution技术（受组件归因方法启发），分析注意力头在识别图像主要对象和回答问题时的作用

Result: 发现特定注意力头子集促进图像到文本信息流，选择基于语义内容；文本信息先传播到角色相关token和最终token，图像信息嵌入对象相关和背景token

Conclusion: 图像到文本信息流遵循结构化过程，在注意力头层面的分析为理解LVLM机制提供了有前景的方向

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) answer visual questions by transferring
information from images to text through a series of attention heads. While this
image-to-text information flow is central to visual question answering, its
underlying mechanism remains difficult to interpret due to the simultaneous
operation of numerous attention heads. To address this challenge, we propose
head attribution, a technique inspired by component attribution methods, to
identify consistent patterns among attention heads that play a key role in
information transfer. Using head attribution, we investigate how LVLMs rely on
specific attention heads to identify and answer questions about the main object
in an image. Our analysis reveals that a distinct subset of attention heads
facilitates the image-to-text information flow. Remarkably, we find that the
selection of these heads is governed by the semantic content of the input image
rather than its visual appearance. We further examine the flow of information
at the token level and discover that (1) text information first propagates to
role-related tokens and the final token before receiving image information, and
(2) image information is embedded in both object-related and background tokens.
Our work provides evidence that image-to-text information flow follows a
structured process, and that analysis at the attention-head level offers a
promising direction toward understanding the mechanisms of LVLMs.

Motivation: 现有的推理时方法在优化初始噪声时存在局限性：优化可能因初始化不良或搜索轨迹不佳而停滞，而探索可能需要大量样本。单一奖励指标或临时组合无法可靠捕捉组合性的所有方面。

Method: 提出CARINOX框架，将噪声优化和探索与基于人类判断相关性的原则性奖励选择程序相结合，克服现有方法的局限性。

Conclusion: CARINOX通过统一的优化-探索框架和原则性奖励选择，有效解决了文本到图像扩散模型的组合对齐问题，显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models, such as Stable Diffusion, can produce
high-quality and diverse images but often fail to achieve compositional
alignment, particularly when prompts describe complex object relationships,
attributes, or spatial arrangements. Recent inference-time approaches address
this by optimizing or exploring the initial noise under the guidance of reward
functions that score text-image alignment without requiring model fine-tuning.
While promising, each strategy has intrinsic limitations when used alone:
optimization can stall due to poor initialization or unfavorable search
trajectories, whereas exploration may require a prohibitively large number of
samples to locate a satisfactory output. Our analysis further shows that
neither single reward metrics nor ad-hoc combinations reliably capture all
aspects of compositionality, leading to weak or inconsistent guidance. To
overcome these challenges, we present Category-Aware Reward-based Initial Noise
Optimization and Exploration (CARINOX), a unified framework that combines noise
optimization and exploration with a principled reward selection procedure
grounded in correlation with human judgments. Evaluations on two complementary
benchmarks covering diverse compositional challenges show that CARINOX raises
average alignment scores by +16% on T2I-CompBench++ and +11% on the HRS
benchmark, consistently outperforming state-of-the-art optimization and
exploration-based methods across all major categories, while preserving image
quality and diversity. The project page is available at

Conclusion: CSDformer成功解决了脉冲转换器的训练成本和硬件友好性问题，在超低延迟下实现高性能，显著降低了计算复杂度和训练开销，为脉冲神经网络的发展提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Spike-based transformer is a novel architecture aiming to enhance the
performance of spiking neural networks while mitigating the energy overhead
inherent to transformers. However, methods for generating these models suffer
from critical limitations: excessive training costs introduced by direct
training methods, or unavoidably hardware-unfriendly operations in existing
conversion methods. In this paper, we propose CSDformer, a novel conversion
method for fully spike-driven transformers. We tailor a conversion-oriented
transformer-based architecture and propose a new function NReLU to replace
softmax in self-attention. Subsequently, this model is quantized and trained,
and converted into a fully spike-driven model with temporal decomposition
technique. Also, we propose delayed Integrate-andFire neurons to reduce
conversion errors and improve the performance of spiking models. We evaluate
CSDformer on ImageNet, CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 datasets and achieve 76.36% top-1
accuracy under 7 time-steps on ImageNet, demonstrating superiority over
state-of-the-art models. Furthermore, CSDformer eliminates the need for
training SNNs, thereby reducing training costs (reducing computational resource
by 75% and accelerating training speed by 2-3$\times$). To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first fully spike-driven transformer-based model
developed via conversion method, achieving high performance under ultra-low
latency, while dramatically reducing both computational complexity and training
overhead.

Abstract: Thanks to capability to alleviate the cost of large-scale annotation,
few-shot action recognition (FSAR) has attracted increased attention of
researchers in recent years. Existing FSAR approaches typically neglect the
role of individual motion pattern in comparison, and under-explore the feature
statistics for video dynamics. Thereby, they struggle to handle the challenging
temporal misalignment in video dynamics, particularly by using 2D backbones. To
overcome these limitations, this work proposes an adaptively aligned
multi-scale second-order moment network, namely A$^2$M$^2$-Net, to describe the
latent video dynamics with a collection of powerful representation candidates
and adaptively align them in an instance-guided manner. To this end, our
A$^2$M$^2$-Net involves two core components, namely, adaptive alignment (A$^2$
module) for matching, and multi-scale second-order moment (M$^2$ block) for
strong representation. Specifically, M$^2$ block develops a collection of
semantic second-order descriptors at multiple spatio-temporal scales.
Furthermore, A$^2$ module aims to adaptively select informative candidate
descriptors while considering the individual motion pattern. By such means, our
A$^2$M$^2$-Net is able to handle the challenging temporal misalignment problem
by establishing an adaptive alignment protocol for strong representation.
Notably, our proposed method generalizes well to various few-shot settings and
diverse metrics. The experiments are conducted on five widely used FSAR
benchmarks, and the results show our A$^2$M$^2$-Net achieves very competitive
performance compared to state-of-the-arts, demonstrating its effectiveness and
generalization.

Abstract: The goal of multi-task learning is to learn to conduct multiple tasks
simultaneously based on a shared data representation. While this approach can

components: the Class-wise Prototype Generator (CPG), the Task-Specific Feature
Generator (TSFG), and the Scene Prototype Aggregator (SPA). CPG groups class
categories into foreground and background groups and generates group-wise
prototypes. The foreground and background prototypes are assigned to the 3D
object detection task and the map segmentation task, respectively, while both
are assigned to the 3D occupancy prediction task. TSFG leverages these
prototype groups to retain task-relevant features while suppressing irrelevant
features, thereby enhancing the performance for each task. SPA enhances the
prototype groups assigned for 3D occupancy prediction by utilizing the
information produced by the 3D object detection head and the map segmentation
head. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes and Occ3D benchmarks demonstrate
that MAESTRO consistently outperforms existing methods across 3D object
detection, BEV map segmentation, and 3D occupancy prediction tasks.

Method: 提出运动先验引导管道分析3D轨迹、过滤噪声，并提供可靠的关节参数初始化；设计混合中心网格部件分配模块用于基于关节的变形场，准确捕捉部件运动。

Conclusion: VideoArtGS实现了从单目视频创建实用的数字孪生，为基于视频的关节物体重建建立了新的基准。

Abstract: Building digital twins of articulated objects from monocular video presents
an essential challenge in computer vision, which requires simultaneous
reconstruction of object geometry, part segmentation, and articulation
parameters from limited viewpoint inputs. Monocular video offers an attractive
input format due to its simplicity and scalability; however, it's challenging
to disentangle the object geometry and part dynamics with visual supervision
alone, as the joint movement of the camera and parts leads to ill-posed
estimation. While motion priors from pre-trained tracking models can alleviate
the issue, how to effectively integrate them for articulation learning remains
largely unexplored. To address this problem, we introduce VideoArtGS, a novel
approach that reconstructs high-fidelity digital twins of articulated objects
from monocular video. We propose a motion prior guidance pipeline that analyzes
3D tracks, filters noise, and provides reliable initialization of articulation
parameters. We also design a hybrid center-grid part assignment module for
articulation-based deformation fields that captures accurate part motion.
VideoArtGS demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in articulation and mesh
reconstruction, reducing the reconstruction error by about two orders of
magnitude compared to existing methods. VideoArtGS enables practical digital
twin creation from monocular video, establishing a new benchmark for
video-based articulated object reconstruction. Our work is made publicly

Motivation: 解决现有方法在表达能力、时间一致性和对未见身份或大姿态变化的泛化能力方面的局限性，特别是扩散模型在弱控制信号和架构限制方面的问题

Result: 实现了优越的时间一致性和准确的表情控制，能够生成高质量、可控的肖像动画，适用于实际应用

Conclusion: 该方法在肖像动画任务中表现出色，通过强运动控制信号和优化的架构设计，解决了现有方法的多个关键问题

Abstract: Portrait animation aims to generate photo-realistic videos from a single
source image by reenacting the expression and pose from a driving video. While
early methods relied on 3D morphable models or feature warping techniques, they
often suffered from limited expressivity, temporal inconsistency, and poor
generalization to unseen identities or large pose variations. Recent advances
using diffusion models have demonstrated improved quality but remain
constrained by weak control signals and architectural limitations. In this
work, we propose a novel diffusion based framework that leverages masked facial
regions specifically the eyes, nose, and mouth from the driving video as strong
motion control cues. To enable robust training without appearance leakage, we
adopt cross identity supervision. To leverage the strong prior from the
pretrained diffusion model, our novel architecture introduces minimal new
parameters that converge faster and help in better generalization. We introduce
spatial temporal attention mechanisms that allow inter frame and intra frame
interactions, effectively capturing subtle motions and reducing temporal
artifacts. Our model uses history frames to ensure continuity across segments.
At inference, we propose a novel signal fusion strategy that balances motion
fidelity with identity preservation. Our approach achieves superior temporal
consistency and accurate expression control, enabling high-quality,
controllable portrait animation suitable for real-world applications.

Abstract: While vision language models (VLMs) excel in 2D semantic visual
understanding, their ability to quantitatively reason about 3D spatial
relationships remains under-explored, due to the deficiency of 2D images'
spatial representation ability. In this paper, we analyze the problem hindering
VLMs' spatial understanding abilities and propose SD-VLM, a novel framework
that significantly enhances fundamental spatial perception abilities of VLMs
through two key contributions: (1) propose Massive Spatial Measuring and
Understanding (MSMU) dataset with precise spatial annotations, and (2)
introduce a simple depth positional encoding method strengthening VLMs' spatial
awareness. MSMU dataset covers massive quantitative spatial tasks with 700K QA
pairs, 2.5M physical numerical annotations, and 10K chain-of-thought augmented
samples. We have trained SD-VLM, a strong generalist VLM which shows superior
quantitative spatial measuring and understanding capability. SD-VLM not only
achieves state-of-the-art performance on our proposed MSMU-Bench, but also
shows spatial generalization abilities on other spatial understanding
benchmarks including Q-Spatial and SpatialRGPT-Bench. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that SD-VLM outperforms GPT-4o and Intern-VL3-78B by 26.91% and

Abstract: Depth imaging is a crucial area in Autonomous Driving Systems (ADS), as it
plays a key role in detecting and measuring objects in the vehicle's
surroundings. However, a significant challenge in this domain arises from
missing information in Depth images, where certain points are not measurable
due to gaps or inconsistencies in pixel data. Our research addresses two key
tasks to overcome this challenge. First, we developed an algorithm using a
multi-layered training approach to generate Depth images from a single RGB
image. Second, we addressed the issue of missing information in Depth images by
applying our algorithm to rectify these gaps, resulting in Depth images with
complete and accurate data. We further tested our algorithm on the Cityscapes
dataset and successfully resolved the missing information in its Depth images,
demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach in real-world urban
environments.

Abstract: Driver drowsiness remains a critical factor in road accidents, accounting for
thousands of fatalities and injuries each year. This paper presents a
comprehensive evaluation of real-time, non-intrusive drowsiness detection
methods, focusing on computer vision based YOLO (You Look Only Once)
algorithms. A publicly available dataset namely, UTA-RLDD was used, containing
both awake and drowsy conditions, ensuring variability in gender, eyewear,
illumination, and skin tone. Seven YOLO variants (v5s, v9c, v9t, v10n, v10l,
v11n, v11l) are fine-tuned, with performance measured in terms of Precision,
Recall, mAP0.5, and mAP 0.5-0.95. Among these, YOLOv9c achieved the highest
accuracy (0.986 mAP 0.5, 0.978 Recall) while YOLOv11n strikes the optimal
balance between precision (0.954) and inference efficiency, making it highly
suitable for embedded deployment. Additionally, we implement an Eye Aspect
Ratio (EAR) approach using Dlib's facial landmarks, which despite its low
computational footprint exhibits reduced robustness under pose variation and
occlusions. Our findings illustrate clear trade offs between accuracy, latency,
and resource requirements, and offer practical guidelines for selecting or
combining detection methods in autonomous driving and industrial safety
applications.

Result: 在两个CI-MLIC基准测试中，长尾多标签图像分类任务mAP提升10.0%和5.2%，多标签少样本图像分类任务提升6.8%和2.9%。

Conclusion: HP-DVAL方法有效缓解了多标签图像分类中的类别不平衡问题，证明了利用多模态知识和分层提示调优策略的优越性。

Abstract: Real-world datasets often exhibit class imbalance across multiple categories,
manifesting as long-tailed distributions and few-shot scenarios. This is
especially challenging in Class-Imbalanced Multi-Label Image Classification
(CI-MLIC) tasks, where data imbalance and multi-object recognition present
significant obstacles. To address these challenges, we propose a novel method
termed Dual-View Alignment Learning with Hierarchical Prompt (HP-DVAL), which
leverages multi-modal knowledge from vision-language pretrained (VLP) models to
mitigate the class-imbalance problem in multi-label settings. Specifically,
HP-DVAL employs dual-view alignment learning to transfer the powerful feature
representation capabilities from VLP models by extracting complementary
features for accurate image-text alignment. To better adapt VLP models for
CI-MLIC tasks, we introduce a hierarchical prompt-tuning strategy that utilizes
global and local prompts to learn task-specific and context-related prior
knowledge. Additionally, we design a semantic consistency loss during prompt
tuning to prevent learned prompts from deviating from general knowledge
embedded in VLP models. The effectiveness of our approach is validated on two
CI-MLIC benchmarks: MS-COCO and VOC2007. Extensive experimental results
demonstrate the superiority of our method over SOTA approaches, achieving mAP
improvements of 10.0\% and 5.2\% on the long-tailed multi-label image
classification task, and 6.8\% and 2.9\% on the multi-label few-shot image
classification task.

Conclusion: 4D-MoDe框架为体积视频的高效压缩和流传输提供了可行的解决方案，在保持高质量的同时显著降低了存储需求，具有重要的实际应用价值。

Abstract: Volumetric video has emerged as a key medium for immersive telepresence and
augmented/virtual reality, enabling six-degrees-of-freedom (6DoF) navigation
and realistic spatial interactions. However, delivering high-quality dynamic
volumetric content at scale remains challenging due to massive data volume,
complex motion, and limited editability of existing representations. In this
paper, we present 4D-MoDe, a motion-decoupled 4D Gaussian compression framework
designed for scalable and editable volumetric video streaming. Our method
introduces a layered representation that explicitly separates static
backgrounds from dynamic foregrounds using a lookahead-based motion
decomposition strategy, significantly reducing temporal redundancy and enabling
selective background/foreground streaming. To capture continuous motion
trajectories, we employ a multi-resolution motion estimation grid and a
lightweight shared MLP, complemented by a dynamic Gaussian compensation
mechanism to model emergent content. An adaptive grouping scheme dynamically
inserts background keyframes to balance temporal consistency and compression
efficiency. Furthermore, an entropy-aware training pipeline jointly optimizes
the motion fields and Gaussian parameters under a rate-distortion (RD)
objective, while employing range-based and KD-tree compression to minimize
storage overhead. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets demonstrate that
4D-MoDe consistently achieves competitive reconstruction quality with an order
of magnitude lower storage cost (e.g., as low as \textbf{11.4} KB/frame)
compared to state-of-the-art methods, while supporting practical applications
such as background replacement and foreground-only streaming.

Abstract: Achieving seamless viewing of high-fidelity volumetric video, comparable to
2D video experiences, remains an open challenge. Existing volumetric video
compression methods either lack the flexibility to adjust quality and bitrate
within a single model for efficient streaming across diverse networks and
devices, or struggle with real-time decoding and rendering on lightweight
mobile platforms. To address these challenges, we introduce 4DGCPro, a novel
hierarchical 4D Gaussian compression framework that facilitates real-time
mobile decoding and high-quality rendering via progressive volumetric video
streaming in a single bitstream. Specifically, we propose a
perceptually-weighted and compression-friendly hierarchical 4D Gaussian
representation with motion-aware adaptive grouping to reduce temporal
redundancy, preserve coherence, and enable scalable multi-level detail
streaming. Furthermore, we present an end-to-end entropy-optimized training
scheme, which incorporates layer-wise rate-distortion (RD) supervision and
attribute-specific entropy modeling for efficient bitstream generation.
Extensive experiments show that 4DGCPro enables flexible quality and multiple
bitrate within a single model, achieving real-time decoding and rendering on

Conclusion: 通过深度整合临床知识与影像特征，UMCF为精准医学中的多模态信息融合提供了新的技术路径。

Abstract: Brain tumor segmentation requires accurate identification of hierarchical
regions including whole tumor (WT), tumor core (TC), and enhancing tumor (ET)
from multi-sequence magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) images. Due to tumor
tissue heterogeneity, ambiguous boundaries, and contrast variations across MRI
sequences, methods relying solely on visual information or post-hoc loss
constraints show unstable performance in boundary delineation and hierarchy
preservation. To address this challenge, we propose the Unified Multimodal
Coherent Field (UMCF) method. This method achieves synchronous interactive
fusion of visual, semantic, and spatial information within a unified 3D latent
space, adaptively adjusting modal contributions through parameter-free
uncertainty gating, with medical prior knowledge directly participating in
attention computation, avoiding the traditional "process-then-concatenate"
separated architecture. On Brain Tumor Segmentation (BraTS) 2020 and 2021
datasets, UMCF+nnU-Net achieves average Dice coefficients of 0.8579 and 0.8977
respectively, with an average 4.18% improvement across mainstream
architectures. By deeply integrating clinical knowledge with imaging features,
UMCF provides a new technical pathway for multimodal information fusion in
precision medicine.

Result: 在视觉和语言任务上达到SOTA结果，同时仅使用少量计算资源

Conclusion: Core Space框架能够有效合并LoRA适配模型，在保持效率的同时显著提升性能

Abstract: In this paper, we address the challenges associated with merging low-rank
adaptations of large neural networks. With the rise of parameter-efficient
adaptation techniques, such as Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), model fine-tuning
has become more accessible. While fine-tuning models with LoRA is highly
efficient, existing merging methods often sacrifice this efficiency by merging
fully-sized weight matrices. We propose the Core Space merging framework, which
enables the merging of LoRA-adapted models within a common alignment basis,
thereby preserving the efficiency of low-rank adaptation while substantially
improving accuracy across tasks. We further provide a formal proof that
projection into Core Space ensures no loss of information and provide a
complexity analysis showing the efficiency gains. Extensive empirical results
demonstrate that Core Space significantly improves existing merging techniques
and achieves state-of-the-art results on both vision and language tasks while
utilizing a fraction of the computational resources. Codebase is available at

Motivation: 传统CBM使用固定的线性分类器，限制了用户干预只能手动调整数值，无法在测试时引入新概念或领域知识，特别是在无监督CBM中概念激活噪声大、干预效果差。

Method: 用基于语言理解的分类器替代分数分类器，利用冻结大语言模型的语义理解能力，直接在概念语义空间进行预测推理。

Result: 在9个数据集上的实验表明，Chat-CBM实现了更高的预测性能，显著改善了用户交互性，同时保持了CBM基于概念的可解释性。

Conclusion: Chat-CBM通过语义空间推理扩展了CBM的干预接口，支持概念修正、增删、外部知识整合和高级推理指导等更丰富的干预方式。

Abstract: Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) provide inherent interpretability by first
predicting a set of human-understandable concepts and then mapping them to
labels through a simple classifier. While users can intervene in the concept
space to improve predictions, traditional CBMs typically employ a fixed linear
classifier over concept scores, which restricts interventions to manual value
adjustments and prevents the incorporation of new concepts or domain knowledge
at test time. These limitations are particularly severe in unsupervised CBMs,
where concept activations are often noisy and densely activated, making user
interventions ineffective. We introduce Chat-CBM, which replaces score-based
classifiers with a language-based classifier that reasons directly over concept
semantics. By grounding prediction in the semantic space of concepts, Chat-CBM
preserves the interpretability of CBMs while enabling richer and more intuitive
interventions, such as concept correction, addition or removal of concepts,
incorporation of external knowledge, and high-level reasoning guidance.
Leveraging the language understanding and few-shot capabilities of frozen large
language models, Chat-CBM extends the intervention interface of CBMs beyond
numerical editing and remains effective even in unsupervised settings.
Experiments on nine datasets demonstrate that Chat-CBM achieves higher
predictive performance and substantially improves user interactivity while
maintaining the concept-based interpretability of CBMs.

Abstract: Medical time series (MedTS) classification is pivotal for intelligent
healthcare, yet its efficacy is severely limited by poor cross-subject
generation due to the profound cross-individual heterogeneity. Despite advances
in architectural innovations and transfer learning techniques, current methods
remain constrained by modality-specific inductive biases that limit their
ability to learn universally invariant representations. To overcome this, we
propose TS-P$^2$CL, a novel plug-and-play framework that leverages the
universal pattern recognition capabilities of pre-trained vision models. We
introduce a vision-guided paradigm that transforms 1D physiological signals
into 2D pseudo-images, establishing a bridge to the visual domain. This
transformation enables implicit access to rich semantic priors learned from
natural images. Within this unified space, we employ a dual-contrastive
learning strategy: intra-modal consistency enforces temporal coherence, while
cross-modal alignment aligns time-series dynamics with visual semantics,
thereby mitigating individual-specific biases and learning robust,
domain-invariant features. Extensive experiments on six MedTS datasets
demonstrate that TS-P$^2$CL consistently outperforms fourteen methods in both
subject-dependent and subject-independent settings.

*Dian Jin,Yanghao Zhou,Jinxing Zhou,Jiaqi Ma,Ruohao Guo,Dan Guo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SimToken是一个用于指代音频-视觉分割的简单框架，通过多模态大语言模型生成语义token来指导SAM模型进行视频对象分割。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 指代音频-视觉分割任务面临跨模态推理和细粒度对象定位的挑战，需要有效整合音频、视觉和文本信息。

Method: 使用多模态大语言模型生成代表目标对象的特殊语义token，该token包含所有模态的上下文信息，作为SAM模型的提示来分割视频帧中的对象。同时引入目标一致性语义对齐损失来改进语义学习。

Result: 在Ref-AVS基准测试中，该方法相比现有方法取得了更优的性能。

Conclusion: SimToken框架通过简单的token生成机制有效解决了跨模态分割问题，证明了语义token在指导分割任务中的有效性。

Abstract: Referring Audio-Visual Segmentation (Ref-AVS) aims to segment specific
objects in videos based on natural language expressions involving audio,
vision, and text information. This task poses significant challenges in
cross-modal reasoning and fine-grained object localization. In this paper, we
propose a simple framework, SimToken, that integrates a multimodal large
language model (MLLM) with the Segment Anything Model (SAM). The MLLM is guided
to generate a special semantic token representing the referred object. This
compact token, enriched with contextual information from all modalities, acts
as a prompt to guide SAM to segment objectsacross video frames. To further
improve semantic learning, we introduce a novel target-consistent semantic
alignment loss that aligns token embeddings from different expressions but
referring to the same object. Experiments on the Ref-AVS benchmark demonstrate
that our approach achieves superior performance compared to existing
methods.Code will be available at https://github.com/DianJin-HFUT/SimToken

*Yuxuan Li,Yicheng Zhang,Wenhao Tang,Yimian Dai,Ming-Ming Cheng,Xiang Li,Jian Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ViTP是一种新的预训练范式，通过视觉指令预训练将视觉Transformer嵌入到视觉语言模型中，利用推理增强感知能力，在遥感和医学影像等下游领域取得了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前计算机视觉中感知、推理和生成的闭环尚未完善，高层推理对低层感知特征学习的影响未被充分探索。本文旨在填补这一空白，提出新的预训练范式。

Method: 提出视觉指令预训练(ViTP)方法，将ViT骨干网络嵌入到视觉语言模型中，使用下游领域的视觉指令数据进行端到端预训练，并采用视觉鲁棒性学习(VRL)从稀疏视觉标记中学习鲁棒特征。

Result: 在16个具有挑战性的遥感和医学影像基准测试上进行了广泛实验，ViTP在各种下游任务中均达到了最先进的性能水平。

Conclusion: ViTP通过将推理直接融入感知学习过程，成功建立了感知与推理之间的有效连接，为下游领域的预训练提供了新的有效范式。

Abstract: Modern computer vision is converging on a closed loop in which perception,
reasoning and generation mutually reinforce each other. However, this loop
remains incomplete: the top-down influence of high-level reasoning on the
foundational learning of low-level perceptual features is not yet
underexplored. This paper addresses this gap by proposing a new paradigm for
pretraining foundation models in downstream domains. We introduce Visual
insTruction Pretraining (ViTP), a novel approach that directly leverages
reasoning to enhance perception. ViTP embeds a Vision Transformer (ViT)
backbone within a Vision-Language Model and pretrains it end-to-end using a
rich corpus of visual instruction data curated from target downstream domains.
ViTP is powered by our proposed Visual Robustness Learning (VRL), which compels
the ViT to learn robust and domain-relevant features from a sparse set of
visual tokens. Extensive experiments on 16 challenging remote sensing and
medical imaging benchmarks demonstrate that ViTP establishes new
state-of-the-art performance across a diverse range of downstream tasks. The
code is available at github.com/zcablii/ViTP.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文介绍了一个结合认知任务分析(CTA)和多模态学习分析(MMLA)的系统化评估框架，用于客观评估重症监护空运团队(CCATT)在混合现实模拟训练中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的教官主导评估方法主观性强，可能忽略关键事件，限制了评估的通用性和一致性。AI自动化评估虽然更客观，但仍需要人工输入来训练算法，特别是在复杂团队动态和环境噪声存在的情况下。

Method: 开发了针对CCATT训练的领域特定CTA模型，并使用基于视觉的动作识别管道（基于微调的人类-物体交互模型CDN）来检测和跟踪学员与设备的交互，自动生成性能指标并映射到分层CTA模型。

Result: 该框架能够自动生成可解释的、与领域相关的性能评估指标（如反应时间、任务持续时间等），为CCATT训练提供更客观全面的评估。

Conclusion: 所提出的数据驱动评估框架结合了认知任务分析和多模态学习分析，能够有效解决CCATT训练中复杂团队动态评估的挑战，为航空医疗后送培训提供了更科学可靠的评估方法。

Abstract: This study examines how Critical Care Air Transport Team (CCATT) members are
trained using mixed-reality simulations that replicate the high-pressure
conditions of aeromedical evacuation. Each team - a physician, nurse, and
respiratory therapist - must stabilize severely injured soldiers by managing
ventilators, IV pumps, and suction devices during flight. Proficient
performance requires clinical expertise and cognitive skills, such as
situational awareness, rapid decision-making, effective communication, and
coordinated task management, all of which must be maintained under stress.
Recent advances in simulation and multimodal data analytics enable more
objective and comprehensive performance evaluation. In contrast, traditional
instructor-led assessments are subjective and may overlook critical events,
thereby limiting generalizability and consistency. However, AI-based automated
and more objective evaluation metrics still demand human input to train the AI
algorithms to assess complex team dynamics in the presence of environmental
noise and the need for accurate re-identification in multi-person tracking. To
address these challenges, we introduce a systematic, data-driven assessment
framework that combines Cognitive Task Analysis (CTA) with Multimodal Learning
Analytics (MMLA). We have developed a domain-specific CTA model for CCATT
training and a vision-based action recognition pipeline using a fine-tuned
Human-Object Interaction model, the Cascade Disentangling Network (CDN), to
detect and track trainee-equipment interactions over time. These interactions
automatically yield performance indicators (e.g., reaction time, task
duration), which are mapped onto a hierarchical CTA model tailored to CCATT
operations, enabling interpretable, domain-relevant performance evaluations.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一个用于相机识别的PRNU基准测试，包含13K张照片和120+相机，并开发了一种基于PRNU的混合架构相机识别模型，在野外场景下显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有相机识别方法在真实场景下性能有限，需要开发能够在不同拍摄场景下进行有效识别的基准测试和模型。

Method: 使用混合架构：去噪自编码器估计PRNU信号，卷积网络进行1:N验证；采用Hadamard乘积而非传统的对比学习。

Result: 提出的方法在基准测试上显著优于基于去噪自编码器和对比学习的现有最先进模型。

Conclusion: 该基准测试和混合架构为相机识别提供了有效的野外评估框架，代码和数据集已开源。

Abstract: We propose a novel benchmark for camera identification via Photo Response
Non-Uniformity (PRNU) estimation. The benchmark comprises 13K photos taken with
120+ cameras, where the training and test photos are taken in different
scenarios, enabling ``in-the-wild'' evaluation. In addition, we propose a novel
PRNU-based camera identification model that employs a hybrid architecture,
comprising a denoising autoencoder to estimate the PRNU signal and a
convolutional network that can perform 1:N verification of camera devices.
Instead of using a conventional approach based on contrastive learning, our
method takes the Hadamard product between reference and query PRNU signals as
input. This novel design leads to significantly better results compared with
state-of-the-art models based on denoising autoencoders and contrastive
learning. We release our dataset and code at:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种用于空间应用中目标检测的监督域自适应方法，通过结合域不变特征学习和不变风险最小化，显著提升了在真实空间数据上的检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前空间应用中的目标检测模型通常在合成数据上训练，但在真实数据上性能显著下降。域自适应目标检测在社区中被忽视，需要解决合成数据与真实数据之间的域差距问题。

Method: 基于半监督自适应方法，结合CNN域判别器的域不变特征学习和域无关回归头的不变风险最小化。在轻量级SSD和先进FCOS检测器上进行测试。

Result: 在SPEED+和SPARK两个空间数据集上评估，仅使用250张标记的真实图像就实现了平均精度(AP)最高20点的提升。

Conclusion: 该方法有效缩小了合成数据与真实数据之间的域差距，显著提高了空间目标检测在真实场景中的性能，满足实时部署需求。

Abstract: Object detection is essential in space applications targeting Space Domain
Awareness and also applications involving relative navigation scenarios.
Current deep learning models for Object Detection in space applications are
often trained on synthetic data from simulators, however, the model performance
drops significantly on real-world data due to the domain gap. However, domain
adaptive object detection is an overlooked problem in the community. In this
work, we first show the importance of domain adaptation and then explore
Supervised Domain Adaptation (SDA) to reduce this gap using minimal labeled
real data. We build on a recent semi-supervised adaptation method and tailor it
for object detection. Our approach combines domain-invariant feature learning
with a CNN-based domain discriminator and invariant risk minimization using a
domain-independent regression head. To meet real-time deployment needs, we test
our method on a lightweight Single Shot Multibox Detector (SSD) with MobileNet
backbone and on the more advanced Fully Convolutional One-Stage object detector
(FCOS) with ResNet-50 backbone. We evaluated on two space datasets, SPEED+ and
SPARK. The results show up to 20-point improvements in average precision (AP)
with just 250 labeled real images.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的测试时自适应方法COLA，利用预训练的视觉语言模型进行多目标域自适应，无需共享标签空间，通过轻量级上下文感知模块和类平衡伪标签策略解决分布偏移问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的测试时自适应方法大多假设源域模型和目标域共享相同的标签空间，这严重限制了其适用性。本文旨在开发一种更通用的源模型，能够适应多个目标域而无需共享标签。

Method: 提出COLA方法，包含轻量级上下文感知模块（任务感知适配器、上下文感知单元和残差连接单元）和类平衡伪标签策略，可无缝集成到冻结的视觉语言模型中。

Result: 该方法不仅在测试时自适应场景中表现有效，在类别泛化任务中也展示了良好的性能。

Conclusion: COLA方法提供了一种参数高效且无需共享标签的测试时自适应解决方案，扩展了现有方法的适用性范围。

Abstract: Test-time adaptation (TTA) has gained increasing popularity due to its
efficacy in addressing ``distribution shift'' issue while simultaneously
protecting data privacy.
  However, most prior methods assume that a paired source domain model and
target domain sharing the same label space coexist, heavily limiting their
applicability.
  In this paper, we investigate a more general source model capable of
adaptation to multiple target domains without needing shared labels.
  This is achieved by using a pre-trained vision-language model (VLM), \egno,
CLIP, that can recognize images through matching with class descriptions.
  While the zero-shot performance of VLMs is impressive, they struggle to
effectively capture the distinctive attributes of a target domain.
  To that end, we propose a novel method -- Context-aware Language-driven TTA
(COLA).
  The proposed method incorporates a lightweight context-aware module that
consists of three key components: a task-aware adapter, a context-aware unit,
and a residual connection unit for exploring task-specific knowledge,
domain-specific knowledge from the VLM and prior knowledge of the VLM,
respectively.
  It is worth noting that the context-aware module can be seamlessly integrated
into a frozen VLM, ensuring both minimal effort and parameter efficiency.
  Additionally, we introduce a Class-Balanced Pseudo-labeling (CBPL) strategy
to mitigate the adverse effects caused by class imbalance.
  We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method not only in TTA scenarios but
also in class generalisation tasks.

TL;DR: PlantCLEF 2025挑战赛旨在利用AI技术加速生态学中的植物物种识别，通过多标签分类方法预测样方图像中的所有物种。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 样方图像在生态研究中至关重要，但人工识别物种耗时且限制了研究规模。AI技术可以帮助专家加速物种编目并扩大生态研究的空间覆盖范围。

Method: 将任务制定为弱标记的多标签分类问题，使用预训练的视觉Transformer模型，基于140万张单标签训练图像来预测样方图像中的所有物种。

Result: 构建了包含2105张高分辨率多标签图像的新测试集，覆盖约400个物种，并提供了大规模训练数据和预训练模型。

Conclusion: PlantCLEF 2025挑战赛为评估AI在植物物种识别方面的进展提供了标准化平台，有望推动生态研究的自动化和规模化。

Abstract: Quadrat images are essential for ecological studies, as they enable
standardized sampling, the assessment of plant biodiversity, long-term
monitoring, and large-scale field campaigns. These images typically cover an
area of fifty centimetres or one square meter, and botanists carefully identify
all the species present. Integrating AI could help specialists accelerate their
inventories and expand the spatial coverage of ecological studies. To assess
progress in this area, the PlantCLEF 2025 challenge relies on a new test set of
2,105 high-resolution multi-label images annotated by experts and covering
around 400 species. It also provides a large training set of 1.4 million
individual plant images, along with vision transformer models pre-trained on
this data. The task is formulated as a (weakly labelled) multi-label
classification problem, where the goal is to predict all species present in a
quadrat image using single-label training data. This paper provides a detailed
description of the data, the evaluation methodology, the methods and models
used by participants, and the results achieved.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉异常检测是一个高度应用驱动的领域，学术界与工业界的连接至关重要。挑战赛旨在展示异常检测在不同实际设置中的当前进展，同时解决该领域的关键问题。

Method: 挑战赛设置了两个赛道：一是开发对真实世界分布偏移具有鲁棒性的异常检测方法；二是探索视觉语言模型在少样本机制下的能力。参赛者通过结合或调整现有方法，并将其与新颖的流程融合来实现改进。

Result: 参赛者的解决方案相比之前的基线取得了显著改进。对于两个赛道，大型预训练视觉（语言）骨干网络的进展对性能提升起到了关键作用。

Conclusion: 虽然大型预训练模型在性能提升中发挥了重要作用，但未来研究需要更有效地扩展异常检测方法，以满足现场实时性和计算约束要求。

Abstract: Visual anomaly detection is a strongly application-driven field of research.
Consequently, the connection between academia and industry is of paramount
importance. In this regard, we present the VAND 3.0 Challenge to showcase
current progress in anomaly detection across different practical settings
whilst addressing critical issues in the field. The challenge hosted two
tracks, fostering the development of anomaly detection methods robust against
real-world distribution shifts (Category 1) and exploring the capabilities of
Vision Language Models within the few-shot regime (Category 2), respectively.
The participants' solutions reached significant improvements over previous
baselines by combining or adapting existing approaches and fusing them with
novel pipelines. While for both tracks the progress in large pre-trained vision
(language) backbones played a pivotal role for the performance increase,
scaling up anomaly detection methods more efficiently needs to be addressed by
future research to meet real-time and computational constraints on-site.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究评估了通用多模态大语言模型（GPT-4、GPT-5）和领域特定模型（MedGemma）在胸部X光片上定位病理的能力，发现它们虽然在某些方面表现有潜力，但整体定位准确性仍低于任务特定CNN模型和放射科医生基准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然前沿大语言模型在医学问答和诊断任务中表现出色，但医学图像解读的关键能力——定位病理发现——尚未得到充分评估。评估定位能力不仅具有临床和教育意义，还能深入了解模型对解剖结构和疾病的空间理解。

Method: 使用CheXlocalize数据集中的9种病理，通过空间网格提示管道评估模型性能。该方法将空间网格叠加在图像上，引导模型进行基于坐标的预测，并与任务特定CNN模型和放射科医生基准进行比较。

Result: GPT-5定位准确率为49.7%，GPT-4为39.1%，MedGemma为17.7%，均低于任务特定CNN基线（59.9%）和放射科医生基准（80.1%）。GPT-5的预测大多在解剖学合理区域但不精确，GPT-4在固定解剖位置的病理上表现良好但在空间可变发现上困难，MedGemma在所有病理上表现最差。

Conclusion: 当前多模态大语言模型在医学影像定位任务中展现出潜力但存在局限性，需要与任务特定工具结合才能实现可靠应用。

Abstract: Recent work has shown promising performance of frontier large language models
(LLMs) and their multimodal counterparts in medical quizzes and diagnostic
tasks, highlighting their potential for broad clinical utility given their
accessible, general-purpose nature. However, beyond diagnosis, a fundamental
aspect of medical image interpretation is the ability to localize pathological
findings. Evaluating localization not only has clinical and educational
relevance but also provides insight into a model's spatial understanding of
anatomy and disease. Here, we systematically assess two general-purpose MLLMs
(GPT-4 and GPT-5) and a domain-specific model (MedGemma) in their ability to
localize pathologies on chest radiographs, using a prompting pipeline that
overlays a spatial grid and elicits coordinate-based predictions. Averaged
across nine pathologies in the CheXlocalize dataset, GPT-5 exhibited a
localization accuracy of 49.7%, followed by GPT-4 (39.1%) and MedGemma (17.7%),
all lower than a task-specific CNN baseline (59.9%) and a radiologist benchmark
(80.1%). Despite modest performance, error analysis revealed that GPT-5's
predictions were largely in anatomically plausible regions, just not always
precisely localized. GPT-4 performed well on pathologies with fixed anatomical
locations, but struggled with spatially variable findings and exhibited
anatomically implausible predictions more frequently. MedGemma demonstrated the
lowest performance on all pathologies, showing limited capacity to generalize
to this novel task. Our findings highlight both the promise and limitations of
current MLLMs in medical imaging and underscore the importance of integrating
them with task-specific tools for reliable use.

Motivation: 在自动驾驶和车辆编队等应用中，预校准设置不切实际且需要实时适应性，因此需要无需先验场景知识的相机内参估计能力

Method: 基于校准三焦张量建立方程组，从最小图像数据实现投影相机自标定，无需标定目标、不限制相机运动，同时估计焦距和主点

Result: 在程序生成的合成环境和结构化数据集场景中评估，证明方法有效性，相比现有学习方法和经典方法在精度和鲁棒性上有显著提升

Conclusion: TrifocalCalib方法为相机自标定提供了有效的解决方案，代码已公开以支持可复现性

Abstract: Estimating camera intrinsic parameters without prior scene knowledge is a
fundamental challenge in computer vision. This capability is particularly
important for applications such as autonomous driving and vehicle platooning,
where precalibrated setups are impractical and real-time adaptability is
necessary. To advance the state-of-the-art, we present a set of equations based
on the calibrated trifocal tensor, enabling projective camera self-calibration
from minimal image data. Our method, termed TrifocalCalib, significantly
improves accuracy and robustness compared to both recent learning-based and
classical approaches. Unlike many existing techniques, our approach requires no
calibration target, imposes no constraints on camera motion, and simultaneously
estimates both focal length and principal point. Evaluations in both
procedurally generated synthetic environments and structured dataset-based
scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. To support
reproducibility, we make the code publicly available.

Conclusion: PlantCLEF2023挑战赛通过大规模多图像分类任务推动了植物自动识别技术的发展，为全球植物识别系统的实现奠定了基础。

Abstract: The world is estimated to be home to over 300,000 species of vascular plants.
In the face of the ongoing biodiversity crisis, expanding our understanding of
these species is crucial for the advancement of human civilization,
encompassing areas such as agriculture, construction, and pharmacopoeia.
However, the labor-intensive process of plant identification undertaken by
human experts poses a significant obstacle to the accumulation of new data and
knowledge. Fortunately, recent advancements in automatic identification,
particularly through the application of deep learning techniques, have shown
promising progress. Despite challenges posed by data-related issues such as a
vast number of classes, imbalanced class distribution, erroneous
identifications, duplications, variable visual quality, and diverse visual
contents (such as photos or herbarium sheets), deep learning approaches have
reached a level of maturity which gives us hope that in the near future we will
have an identification system capable of accurately identifying all plant
species worldwide. The PlantCLEF2023 challenge aims to contribute to this
pursuit by addressing a multi-image (and metadata) classification problem
involving an extensive set of classes (80,000 plant species). This paper
provides an overview of the challenge's resources and evaluations, summarizes
the methods and systems employed by participating research groups, and presents

Motivation: 现有基于扩散模型的视频插入方法依赖复杂控制信号但难以保持主体一致性，限制了实际应用。本文专注于无掩码视频插入任务，旨在解决数据稀缺、主体-场景平衡和插入协调性三大挑战。

Method: 提出InsertPipe数据管道自动构建多样化交叉配对数据；开发OmniInsert统一框架，包含条件特定特征注入机制、渐进式训练策略、主体聚焦损失函数；引入插入偏好优化方法和上下文感知重述模块。

Abstract: Recent advances in video insertion based on diffusion models are impressive.
However, existing methods rely on complex control signals but struggle with
subject consistency, limiting their practical applicability. In this paper, we
focus on the task of Mask-free Video Insertion and aim to resolve three key
challenges: data scarcity, subject-scene equilibrium, and insertion
harmonization. To address the data scarcity, we propose a new data pipeline
InsertPipe, constructing diverse cross-pair data automatically. Building upon
our data pipeline, we develop OmniInsert, a novel unified framework for
mask-free video insertion from both single and multiple subject references.
Specifically, to maintain subject-scene equilibrium, we introduce a simple yet
effective Condition-Specific Feature Injection mechanism to distinctly inject
multi-source conditions and propose a novel Progressive Training strategy that
enables the model to balance feature injection from subjects and source video.
Meanwhile, we design the Subject-Focused Loss to improve the detailed
appearance of the subjects. To further enhance insertion harmonization, we
propose an Insertive Preference Optimization methodology to optimize the model
by simulating human preferences, and incorporate a Context-Aware Rephraser
module during reference to seamlessly integrate the subject into the original
scenes. To address the lack of a benchmark for the field, we introduce
InsertBench, a comprehensive benchmark comprising diverse scenes with
meticulously selected subjects. Evaluation on InsertBench indicates OmniInsert
outperforms state-of-the-art closed-source commercial solutions. The code will
be released.

Motivation: 全球有超过30万种维管植物，人工专家识别限制了新数据的积累。在生物多样性危机背景下，自动识别技术对农业发展、建筑、药典等领域至关重要。

Conclusion: 深度学习技术已足够成熟，能够应对全球植物生物多样性识别的现实挑战，尽管数据存在多种问题，但自动识别系统显示出巨大潜力。

Abstract: It is estimated that there are more than 300,000 species of vascular plants
in the world. Increasing our knowledge of these species is of paramount
importance for the development of human civilization (agriculture,
construction, pharmacopoeia, etc.), especially in the context of the
biodiversity crisis. However, the burden of systematic plant identification by
human experts strongly penalizes the aggregation of new data and knowledge.
Since then, automatic identification has made considerable progress in recent
years as highlighted during all previous editions of PlantCLEF. Deep learning
techniques now seem mature enough to address the ultimate but realistic problem
of global identification of plant biodiversity in spite of many problems that
the data may present (a huge number of classes, very strongly unbalanced
classes, partially erroneous identifications, duplications, variable visual
quality, diversity of visual contents such as photos or herbarium sheets, etc).
The PlantCLEF2022 challenge edition proposes to take a step in this direction
by tackling a multi-image (and metadata) classification problem with a very
large number of classes (80k plant species). This paper presents the resources
and evaluations of the challenge, summarizes the approaches and systems
employed by the participating research groups, and provides an analysis of key

### [173] [Tailored Transformation Invariance for Industrial Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17670)
*Mariette Schönfeld,Wannes Meert,Hendrik Blockeel*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LWinNN是一种基于局部窗口的工业异常检测方法，在kNN方法和复杂SOTA方法之间找到平衡点，通过有限平移不变性假设显著提升准确率并降低训练和测试时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工业异常检测方法要么过于简单（kNN方法），要么训练成本过高。研究发现主流基准测试只需要对轻微平移具有鲁棒性，因此需要一种折中方案。

Method: 提出LWinNN方法，使用局部窗口创建kNN方法的中间方案，既不完全平移不变也不完全不平移不变，而是有限平移不变性。

Result: 实验表明该方法显著提高了准确率，同时减少了训练和测试时间，在kNN方法和复杂SOTA方法之间建立了新的平衡点。

Conclusion: kNN方法与SOTA方法之间的差距仍可通过有效利用有限数据来缩小，同时需要更多空间多样性的基准测试，LWinNN可作为新的基线方法。

Abstract: Industrial Anomaly Detection (IAD) is a subproblem within Computer Vision
Anomaly Detection that has been receiving increasing amounts of attention due
to its applicability to real-life scenarios. Recent research has focused on how
to extract the most informative features, contrasting older kNN-based methods
that use only pretrained features. These recent methods are much more expensive
to train however and could complicate real-life application. Careful study of
related work with regards to transformation invariance leads to the idea that
popular benchmarks require robustness to only minor translations. With this
idea we then formulate LWinNN, a local window based approach that creates a
middle ground between kNN based methods that have either complete or no
translation invariance. Our experiments demonstrate that this small change
increases accuracy considerably, while simultaneously decreasing both train and
test time. This teaches us two things: first, the gap between kNN-based
approaches and more complex state-of-the-art methodology can still be narrowed
by effective usage of the limited data available. Second, our assumption of
requiring only limited translation invariance highlights potential areas of
interest for future work and the need for more spatially diverse benchmarks,
for which our method can hopefully serve as a new baseline. Our code can be
found at https://github.com/marietteschonfeld/LWinNN .

### [174] [UniPixel: Unified Object Referring and Segmentation for Pixel-Level Visual Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18094)
*Ye Liu,Zongyang Ma,Junfu Pu,Zhongang Qi,Yang Wu,Ying Shan,Chang Wen Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniPixel是一个大型多模态模型，能够灵活理解视觉提示输入并生成基于掩码的响应，将像素级感知与通用视觉理解能力无缝集成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大多模态模型主要关注整体图像和视频语言理解，而较少关注细粒度像素级理解能力。之前的研究虽然应用于区域级字幕和参考表达分割等任务，但这些模型仅限于独立执行参考或分割任务，未能将这些细粒度感知能力整合到视觉推理中。

Method: UniPixel处理视觉提示并根据需求生成相关掩码，在推理过程中基于这些中间指针进行后续推理，从而实现细粒度像素级推理。

Result: 该方法在10个基准测试中验证了有效性，涵盖像素级参考/分割和图像/视频中的对象中心理解等多样化任务。还设计了新的PixelQA任务来验证方法的灵活性。

Conclusion: UniPixel成功地将像素级感知与通用视觉理解能力相结合，为细粒度像素级推理提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in Large Multi-modal Models (LMMs) have demonstrated their
remarkable success as general-purpose multi-modal assistants, with particular
focuses on holistic image- and video-language understanding. Conversely, less
attention has been given to scaling fine-grained pixel-level understanding
capabilities, where the models are expected to realize pixel-level alignment
between visual signals and language semantics. Some previous studies have
applied LMMs to related tasks such as region-level captioning and referring
expression segmentation. However, these models are limited to performing either
referring or segmentation tasks independently and fail to integrate these
fine-grained perception capabilities into visual reasoning. To bridge this gap,
we propose UniPixel, a large multi-modal model capable of flexibly
comprehending visual prompt inputs and generating mask-grounded responses. Our
model distinguishes itself by seamlessly integrating pixel-level perception
with general visual understanding capabilities. Specifically, UniPixel
processes visual prompts and generates relevant masks on demand, and performs
subsequent reasoning conditioning on these intermediate pointers during
inference, thereby enabling fine-grained pixel-level reasoning. The
effectiveness of our approach has been verified on 10 benchmarks across a
diverse set of tasks, including pixel-level referring/segmentation and
object-centric understanding in images/videos. A novel PixelQA task that
jointly requires referring, segmentation, and question answering is also
designed to verify the flexibility of our method.

### [175] [Automated Labeling of Intracranial Arteries with Uncertainty Quantification Using Deep Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17726)
*Javier Bisbal,Patrick Winter,Sebastian Jofre,Aaron Ponce,Sameer A. Ansari,Ramez Abdalla,Michael Markl,Oliver Welin Odeback,Sergio Uribe,Cristian Tejos,Julio Sotelo,Susanne Schnell,David Marlevi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出基于深度学习的颅内动脉自动标注框架，结合不确定性量化提高可靠性和可解释性，在3D TOF-MRA数据上验证了三种CNN架构的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 颅内动脉的精确解剖标注对脑血管诊断和血流动力学分析至关重要，但目前方法耗时且存在操作者间变异性。

Method: 评估了三种卷积神经网络架构：带残差编码器的UNet、增强注意力的CS-Net和自配置的nnUNet，并采用测试时增强和坐标引导策略进行不确定性量化。

Result: nnUNet表现最佳（平均Dice分数：0.922；平均表面距离：0.387 mm），在复杂血管中具有更好的鲁棒性，不确定性映射能可靠指示解剖模糊区域。

Conclusion: 该框架为自动化脑血管标注提供了可扩展、准确且具备不确定性感知的解决方案，支持下游血流动力学分析和临床整合。

Abstract: Accurate anatomical labeling of intracranial arteries is essential for
cerebrovascular diagnosis and hemodynamic analysis but remains time-consuming
and subject to interoperator variability. We present a deep learning-based
framework for automated artery labeling from 3D Time-of-Flight Magnetic
Resonance Angiography (3D ToF-MRA) segmentations (n=35), incorporating
uncertainty quantification to enhance interpretability and reliability. We
evaluated three convolutional neural network architectures: (1) a UNet with
residual encoder blocks, reflecting commonly used baselines in vascular
labeling; (2) CS-Net, an attention-augmented UNet incorporating channel and
spatial attention mechanisms for enhanced curvilinear structure recognition;
and (3) nnUNet, a self-configuring framework that automates preprocessing,
training, and architectural adaptation based on dataset characteristics. Among
these, nnUNet achieved the highest labeling performance (average Dice score:
0.922; average surface distance: 0.387 mm), with improved robustness in
anatomically complex vessels. To assess predictive confidence, we implemented
test-time augmentation (TTA) and introduced a novel coordinate-guided strategy
to reduce interpolation errors during augmented inference. The resulting
uncertainty maps reliably indicated regions of anatomical ambiguity,
pathological variation, or manual labeling inconsistency. We further validated
clinical utility by comparing flow velocities derived from automated and manual
labels in co-registered 4D Flow MRI datasets, observing close agreement with no
statistically significant differences. Our framework offers a scalable,
accurate, and uncertainty-aware solution for automated cerebrovascular
labeling, supporting downstream hemodynamic analysis and facilitating clinical
integration.

### [176] [Evict3R: Training-Free Token Eviction for Memory-Bounded Streaming Visual Geometry Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17650)
*Soroush Mahdi,Fardin Ayar,Ehsan Javanmardi,Manabu Tsukada,Mahdi Javanmardi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种无需训练、在推理时使用的令牌驱逐策略，通过丢弃冗余令牌来限制内存增长，使StreamVGGT等流式视觉变换器在保持精度的同时显著减少内存使用。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 流式视觉变换器如StreamVGGT在3D感知方面表现强劲，但存在键值（KV）内存无限制增长的问题，限制了其可扩展性。

Method: 在推理时使用令牌驱逐策略，有选择地丢弃冗余令牌，保留最具信息量的令牌，从而限制内存使用。

Result: 在7-Scenes长序列上，峰值内存从18.63GB降至9.39GB，精度和完整性仅下降0.003；在严格内存预算下，通过更密集的帧采样提高了重建精度。

Conclusion: 该方法在视频深度估计、3D重建和相机姿态估计等多个任务上接近StreamVGGT性能，但内存使用大幅减少，使长序列流式推理更加实用。

Abstract: Streaming visual transformers like StreamVGGT achieve strong 3D perception
but suffer from unbounded growth of key value (KV) memory, which limits
scalability. We propose a training-free, inference-time token eviction policy
that bounds memory by discarding redundant tokens while keeping the most
informative ones. Our method uses significantly less memory with little to no
drop in accuracy: on 7-Scenes with long sequences it reduces peak memory from
18.63 GB to 9.39 GB while accuracy and completeness drop by only 0.003. Under
strict memory budgets, eviction enables denser frame sampling, which improves
reconstruction accuracy compared to the baseline. Experiments across video
depth estimation (Sintel, KITTI), 3D reconstruction (7-Scenes, NRGBD), and
camera pose estimation (Sintel, TUM-dynamics) show that our approach closely
matches StreamVGGT at a fraction of the memory and makes long-horizon streaming
inference more practical.

### [177] [SISMA: Semantic Face Image Synthesis with Mamba](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17651)
*Filippo Botti,Alex Ergasti,Tomaso Fontanini,Claudio Ferrari,Massimo Bertozzi,Andrea Prati*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于Mamba的新型架构SISMA，用于语义图像合成，相比基于Transformer的扩散模型，在保持高质量生成的同时显著降低了计算需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在语义图像合成中很受欢迎，但其训练和推理计算成本高，主要由于注意力层的二次复杂度。需要一种更轻量高效的替代方案。

Method: 提出SISMA架构，基于最近提出的Mamba模型，通过语义掩码控制生成图像的形状，同时降低计算需求。

Result: 在CelebAMask-HQ数据集上的实验表明，SISMA不仅获得了更好的FID分数，而且运行速度比最先进架构快三倍。

Conclusion: SISMA是基于Transformer模型的一个可行、轻量级替代方案，能够在保持生成质量的同时显著提升效率。

Abstract: Diffusion Models have become very popular for Semantic Image Synthesis (SIS)
of human faces. Nevertheless, their training and inference is computationally
expensive and their computational requirements are high due to the quadratic
complexity of attention layers. In this paper, we propose a novel architecture
called SISMA, based on the recently proposed Mamba. SISMA generates high
quality samples by controlling their shape using a semantic mask at a reduced
computational demand. We validated our approach through comprehensive
experiments with CelebAMask-HQ, revealing that our architecture not only
achieves a better FID score yet also operates at three times the speed of
state-of-the-art architectures. This indicates that the proposed design is a
viable, lightweight substitute to transformer-based models.

### [178] [Clothing agnostic Pre-inpainting Virtual Try-ON](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17654)
*Sehyun Kim,Hye Jun Lee,Jiwoo Lee,Taemin Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出CaP-VTON方法，通过多类别掩码和皮肤修复技术改进虚拟试穿效果，在短袖合成准确率上比Leffa提升15.4%


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有扩散模型在虚拟试穿中存在的底部检测不准确和服装轮廓残留问题，提升全身服装合成的自然度和一致性

Method: 基于Dress Code的多类别掩码和基于Stable Diffusion的皮肤修复技术，特别引入了生成皮肤模块来处理长袖转短袖/无袖时的皮肤修复问题

Result: CaP-VTON在短袖合成准确率达到92.5%，比Leffa提升15.4%，在视觉评估中能一致地复现参考服装的风格和形状

Conclusion: 该方法具有模型无关特性，可应用于各种基于扩散的虚拟试穿系统，对电商、定制造型和虚拟形象创建等高精度虚拟试穿应用有重要贡献

Abstract: With the development of deep learning technology, virtual try-on technology
has become an important application value in the fields of e-commerce, fashion,
and entertainment. The recently proposed Leffa has improved the texture
distortion problem of diffu-sion-based models, but there are limitations in
that the bottom detection inaccuracy and the existing clothing silhouette
remain in the synthesis results. To solve this problem, this study proposes
CaP-VTON (Clothing agnostic Pre-inpainting Virtual Try-ON). CaP-VTON has
improved the naturalness and consistency of whole-body clothing syn-thesis by
integrating multi-category masking based on Dress Code and skin inpainting
based on Stable Diffusion. In particular, a generate skin module was introduced
to solve the skin restoration problem that occurs when long-sleeved images are
converted into short-sleeved or sleeveless ones, and high-quality restoration
was implemented consider-ing the human body posture and color. As a result,
CaP-VTON recorded 92.5\%, which is 15.4\% better than Leffa in short-sleeved
synthesis accuracy, and showed the performance of consistently reproducing the
style and shape of reference clothing in visual evaluation. These structures
maintain model-agnostic properties and are applicable to various
diffu-sion-based virtual inspection systems, and can contribute to applications
that require high-precision virtual wearing, such as e-commerce, custom
styling, and avatar creation.

### [179] [Can multimodal representation learning by alignment preserve modality-specific information?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17943)
*Romain Thoreau,Jessie Levillain,Dawa Derksen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文研究了多模态卫星数据对比学习中空间对齐策略可能导致任务相关信息丢失的问题，并通过理论分析和实验验证了这一现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在遥感领域，多模态数据融合面临标注数据稀缺的挑战。现有的自监督学习方法利用不同模态卫星数据的空间对齐来促进潜在空间的语义对齐，但这种方法可能无法保留模态间不共享的任务相关信息。

Method: 首先在简化假设下进行理论分析，证明对齐策略可能导致信息丢失；然后在更现实的设置下进行数值实验来支持理论发现。

Result: 理论和实验证据表明，单纯的空间对齐策略会丢失模态特定的任务相关信息。

Conclusion: 研究结果为多模态卫星数据对比学习的新发展提供了理论基础，强调了需要改进现有对齐方法以保留模态特定信息的重要性。

Abstract: Combining multimodal data is a key issue in a wide range of machine learning
tasks, including many remote sensing problems. In Earth observation, early
multimodal data fusion methods were based on specific neural network
architectures and supervised learning. Ever since, the scarcity of labeled data
has motivated self-supervised learning techniques. State-of-the-art multimodal
representation learning techniques leverage the spatial alignment between
satellite data from different modalities acquired over the same geographic area
in order to foster a semantic alignment in the latent space. In this paper, we
investigate how this methods can preserve task-relevant information that is not
shared across modalities. First, we show, under simplifying assumptions, when
alignment strategies fundamentally lead to an information loss. Then, we
support our theoretical insight through numerical experiments in more realistic
settings. With those theoretical and empirical evidences, we hope to support
new developments in contrastive learning for the combination of multimodal
satellite data. Our code and data is publicly available at

TL;DR: 本文开发了首个基于AI基础模型的食管胃结合部腺癌筛查和分期诊断方法，使用DINOv2和ResNet50提取内镜图像特征，在多个测试集上表现优于现有AI模型和专家医生。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 食管胃结合部腺癌的早期检测对改善患者预后至关重要，但现有诊断高度依赖操作者经验，需要开发更客观准确的AI诊断方法。

Method: 采用多中心研究设计，收集12,302张内镜图像，使用DINOv2（视觉基础模型）和ResNet50（卷积神经网络）联合提取图像的全局外观和局部细节特征进行分期诊断。

Result: 模型在三个测试集上的准确率分别达到0.9256、0.8895和0.8956，优于最佳AI模型（ResNet50）的0.9125、0.8382和0.8519，以及专家医生的0.8147。辅助医生诊断后，各层级医生的准确率均有显著提升。

Conclusion: 这是基础模型在食管胃结合部腺癌分期诊断中的首次应用，在诊断准确性和效率方面展现出巨大潜力。

Abstract: The early detection of esophagogastric junction adenocarcinoma (EGJA) is
crucial for improving patient prognosis, yet its current diagnosis is highly
operator-dependent. This paper aims to make the first attempt to develop an
artificial intelligence (AI) foundation model-based method for both screening
and staging diagnosis of EGJA using endoscopic images. In this cohort and
learning study, we conducted a multicentre study across seven Chinese hospitals
between December 28, 2016 and December 30, 2024. It comprises 12,302 images
from 1,546 patients; 8,249 of them were employed for model training, while the
remaining were divided into the held-out (112 patients, 914 images), external
(230 patients, 1,539 images), and prospective (198 patients, 1,600 images) test
sets for evaluation. The proposed model employs DINOv2 (a vision foundation
model) and ResNet50 (a convolutional neural network) to extract features of
global appearance and local details of endoscopic images for EGJA staging
diagnosis. Our model demonstrates satisfactory performance for EGJA staging
diagnosis across three test sets, achieving an accuracy of 0.9256, 0.8895, and
0.8956, respectively. In contrast, among representative AI models, the best one
(ResNet50) achieves an accuracy of 0.9125, 0.8382, and 0.8519 on the three test
sets, respectively; the expert endoscopists achieve an accuracy of 0.8147 on
the held-out test set. Moreover, with the assistance of our model, the overall
accuracy for the trainee, competent, and expert endoscopists improves from
0.7035, 0.7350, and 0.8147 to 0.8497, 0.8521, and 0.8696, respectively. To our
knowledge, our model is the first application of foundation models for EGJA
staging diagnosis and demonstrates great potential in both diagnostic accuracy
and efficiency.

*ThankGod Egbe,Peng Wang,Zhihao Guo,Zidong Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文评估了DINOv3在机器人操作中的视觉运动扩散策略学习效果，发现自监督的DINOv3在微调后能匹配或超越传统的监督式ImageNet预训练骨干网络，特别是在样本效率和鲁棒性方面表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究自监督大规模视觉模型是否能在机器人操作任务中作为感知前端，替代传统的监督预训练骨干网络，探索无标签预训练在机器人操作中的潜力。

Method: 在四个基准任务（Push-T、Lift、Can、Square）上，使用统一的FiLM条件扩散策略，比较DINOv3与ResNet-18在三种训练模式（从头训练、冻结、微调）下的性能。

Result: 微调后的DINOv3在多个任务上匹配或超越ResNet-18；冻结的DINOv3仍保持竞争力；自监督特征提高了样本效率和鲁棒性；在Can任务上成功率提升10%。

Conclusion: 自监督大规模视觉模型可作为动作扩散策略的有效、通用感知前端，支持在机器人操作中进一步探索可扩展的无标签预训练方法。

Abstract: This paper evaluates DINOv3, a recent large-scale self-supervised vision
backbone, for visuomotor diffusion policy learning in robotic manipulation. We
investigate whether a purely self-supervised encoder can match or surpass
conventional supervised ImageNet-pretrained backbones (e.g., ResNet-18) under
three regimes: training from scratch, frozen, and finetuned. Across four
benchmark tasks (Push-T, Lift, Can, Square) using a unified FiLM-conditioned
diffusion policy, we find that (i) finetuned DINOv3 matches or exceeds
ResNet-18 on several tasks, (ii) frozen DINOv3 remains competitive, indicating
strong transferable priors, and (iii) self-supervised features improve sample
efficiency and robustness. These results support self-supervised large visual
models as effective, generalizable perceptual front-ends for action diffusion
policies, motivating further exploration of scalable label-free pretraining in
robotic manipulation. Compared to using ResNet18 as a backbone, our approach
with DINOv3 achieves up to a 10% absolute increase in test-time success rates
on challenging tasks such as Can, and on-the-par performance in tasks like
Lift, PushT, and Square.

*Žiga Babnik,Deepak Kumar Jain,Peter Peer,Vitomir Štruc*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FROQ是一种半监督、无需训练的face image quality assessment方法，结合了监督方法的效率和无需训练的优势，通过利用FR模型中的特定中间表示来估计人脸图像质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的FIQA技术要么需要大量监督训练，要么是无监督但性能较低。需要一种既能保持高性能又无需显式训练的方法。

Method: FROQ利用FR模型中的特定中间表示来估计质量，通过基于伪质量标签的简单校准步骤，结合一种基于样本扰动的新型无监督FIQA技术生成伪标签。

Result: 在4个最先进FR模型和8个基准数据集上的实验表明，FROQ达到了与最先进方法相竞争的结果，同时保持了高效运行时间。

Conclusion: FROQ成功地将监督FIQA模型的效率与无监督方法的无需训练优势相结合，为face recognition系统提供了可靠的质量评估方案。

Abstract: Face Recognition (FR) plays a crucial role in many critical (high-stakes)
applications, where errors in the recognition process can lead to serious
consequences. Face Image Quality Assessment (FIQA) techniques enhance FR
systems by providing quality estimates of face samples, enabling the systems to
discard samples that are unsuitable for reliable recognition or lead to
low-confidence recognition decisions. Most state-of-the-art FIQA techniques
rely on extensive supervised training to achieve accurate quality estimation.
In contrast, unsupervised techniques eliminate the need for additional training
but tend to be slower and typically exhibit lower performance. In this paper,
we introduce FROQ (Face Recognition Observer of Quality), a semi-supervised,
training-free approach that leverages specific intermediate representations
within a given FR model to estimate face-image quality, and combines the
efficiency of supervised FIQA models with the training-free approach of
unsupervised methods. A simple calibration step based on pseudo-quality labels
allows FROQ to uncover specific representations, useful for quality assessment,
in any modern FR model. To generate these pseudo-labels, we propose a novel
unsupervised FIQA technique based on sample perturbations. Comprehensive
experiments with four state-of-the-art FR models and eight benchmark datasets
show that FROQ leads to highly competitive results compared to the
state-of-the-art, achieving both strong performance and efficient runtime,
without requiring explicit training.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自主机器人系统在新领域应用时需要大量昂贵的像素级密集标签来训练语义分割模型，而弱监督方法可以避免昂贵的标注过程

Method: 通过图像级监督生成像素级语义标签，并添加像素级深度信息作为额外监督，提出深度边缘对齐损失来改进分割模型

Result: 在PASCAL VOC/MS COCO验证集和HOPE静态登机分割上，分别提升了5.439、1.274和16.416个mIoU点

Conclusion: 该方法能有效提升跨数据集和模型的分割性能，并可与其他损失函数结合获得更好效果

Abstract: Autonomous robotic systems applied to new domains require an abundance of
expensive, pixel-level dense labels to train robust semantic segmentation
models under full supervision. This study proposes a model-agnostic Depth Edge
Alignment Loss to improve Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation models across
different datasets. The methodology generates pixel-level semantic labels from
image-level supervision, avoiding expensive annotation processes. While weak
supervision is widely explored in traditional computer vision, our approach
adds supervision with pixel-level depth information, a modality commonly
available in robotic systems. We demonstrate how our approach improves
segmentation performance across datasets and models, but can also be combined
with other losses for even better performance, with improvements up to +5.439,
+1.274 and +16.416 points in mean Intersection over Union on the PASCAL VOC /
MS COCO validation, and the HOPE static onboarding split, respectively. Our
code will be made publicly available.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于神经动力学驱动的耦合神经P系统（ND-CNPFuse）用于多焦点图像融合，通过分析神经动力学特性生成高质量决策图，无需后处理即可直接区分聚焦和非聚焦区域。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于启发式规则的方法和深度学习黑盒机制难以生成具有精确边界的高质量决策图，因此需要开发更准确和可解释的融合方法。

Method: 引入第三代神经计算模型——神经动力学驱动的耦合神经P系统，通过分析模型神经动力学特性，将源图像映射为可解释的脉冲矩阵，通过比较脉冲数量直接生成准确决策图。

Result: 在四个经典多焦点图像融合数据集（Lytro、MFFW、MFI-WHU、Real-MFF）上实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: ND-CNPFuse模型通过神经动力学分析避免了神经元异常连续放电，能够准确区分聚焦和非聚焦区域，为多焦点图像融合任务提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-focus image fusion (MFIF) is a crucial technique in image processing,
with a key challenge being the generation of decision maps with precise
boundaries. However, traditional methods based on heuristic rules and deep
learning methods with black-box mechanisms are difficult to generate
high-quality decision maps. To overcome this challenge, we introduce
neurodynamics-driven coupled neural P (CNP) systems, which are third-generation
neural computation models inspired by spiking mechanisms, to enhance the
accuracy of decision maps. Specifically, we first conduct an in-depth analysis
of the model's neurodynamics to identify the constraints between the network
parameters and the input signals. This solid analysis avoids abnormal
continuous firing of neurons and ensures the model accurately distinguishes
between focused and unfocused regions, generating high-quality decision maps
for MFIF. Based on this analysis, we propose a
\textbf{N}eurodynamics-\textbf{D}riven \textbf{CNP} \textbf{F}usion model
(\textbf{ND-CNPFuse}) tailored for the challenging MFIF task. Unlike current
ideas of decision map generation, ND-CNPFuse distinguishes between focused and
unfocused regions by mapping the source image into interpretable spike
matrices. By comparing the number of spikes, an accurate decision map can be
generated directly without any post-processing. Extensive experimental results
show that ND-CNPFuse achieves new state-of-the-art performance on four
classical MFIF datasets, including Lytro, MFFW, MFI-WHU, and Real-MFF. The code
is available at https://github.com/MorvanLi/ND-CNPFuse.

Abstract: The standardisation of Intermodal Loading Units (ILUs), such as containers,
semi-trailers and swap bodies, has revolutionised global trade yet their
efficient and robust identification remains a critical bottleneck in
high-throughput ports and terminals. This paper reviews 63 empirical studies
that propose computer vision (CV) based solutions. It covers the last 35 years
(1990-2025), tracing the field's evolution from early digital image processing
(DIP) and traditional machine learning (ML) to the current dominance of deep
learning (DL) techniques. While CV offers cost-effective alternatives for other
types of identification techniques, its development is hindered by the lack of
publicly available benchmarking datasets. This results in high variance for the
reported results such as end-to-end accuracy ranging from 5 % to 96 %. Beyond
dataset limitations, this review highlights the emerging challenges especially
introduced by the shift from character-based text recognition to scene-text
spotting and the integration of mobile cameras (e.g. drones, sensor equipped
ground vehicles) for dynamic terminal monitoring. To advance the field, the
paper calls for standardised terminology, open-access datasets, shared source
code, while outlining future research directions such as contextless text
recognition optimised for ISO6346 codes.

*Geonho Bang,Minjae Seong,Jisong Kim,Geunju Baek,Daye Oh,Junhyung Kim,Junho Koh,Jun Won Choi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RCTDistill是一种基于时序融合的跨模态知识蒸馏方法，通过三个关键模块（RAKD、TKD、RDKD）解决雷达-相机融合中的不确定性，在nuScenes和VoD数据集上达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的雷达-相机融合方法在性能上仍落后于LiDAR方法，且未能充分处理物体运动和传感器特定误差带来的不确定性。

Method: 提出RCTDistill框架，包含三个模块：RAKD处理距离和方位角误差，TKD解决动态物体的时序错位，RDKD增强特征判别能力。

Result: 在nuScenes和View-of-Delft数据集上达到最先进的雷达-相机融合性能，推理速度达26.2 FPS。

Conclusion: 该方法通过有效处理传感器不确定性和时序错位问题，显著提升了雷达-相机融合的3D目标检测性能。

Abstract: Radar-camera fusion methods have emerged as a cost-effective approach for 3D
object detection but still lag behind LiDAR-based methods in performance.
Recent works have focused on employing temporal fusion and Knowledge
Distillation (KD) strategies to overcome these limitations. However, existing
approaches have not sufficiently accounted for uncertainties arising from
object motion or sensor-specific errors inherent in radar and camera
modalities. In this work, we propose RCTDistill, a novel cross-modal KD method
based on temporal fusion, comprising three key modules: Range-Azimuth Knowledge
Distillation (RAKD), Temporal Knowledge Distillation (TKD), and
Region-Decoupled Knowledge Distillation (RDKD). RAKD is designed to consider
the inherent errors in the range and azimuth directions, enabling effective
knowledge transfer from LiDAR features to refine inaccurate BEV
representations. TKD mitigates temporal misalignment caused by dynamic objects
by aligning historical radar-camera BEV features with current LiDAR
representations. RDKD enhances feature discrimination by distilling relational
knowledge from the teacher model, allowing the student to differentiate
foreground and background features. RCTDistill achieves state-of-the-art
radar-camera fusion performance on both the nuScenes and View-of-Delft (VoD)
datasets, with the fastest inference speed of 26.2 FPS.

TL;DR: 提出WISE方法，通过弱监督将概念瓶颈模型的概念表示转化为可解释的推理链，增强多模态大语言模型在细粒度视觉理解中的性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MCoT方法依赖丰富标注数据集且主要关注对象间推理，忽视了图像分类中至关重要的对象内理解

Method: WISE方法：弱监督引导的逐步解释方法，将概念瓶颈模型的概念表示重新表述为简洁可解释的推理链

Result: 在10个数据集上的实验显示，生成的MCoTs不仅将可解释性提高了37%，还能在微调MLLMs时提升分类准确率

Conclusion: 该工作连接了基于概念的可解释性和生成式MCoT推理，为增强MLLMs在细粒度视觉理解方面提供了通用框架

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown promise in visual-textual
reasoning, with Multimodal Chain-of-Thought (MCoT) prompting significantly
enhancing interpretability. However, existing MCoT methods rely on
rationale-rich datasets and largely focus on inter-object reasoning,
overlooking the intra-object understanding crucial for image classification. To
address this gap, we propose WISE, a Weak-supervision-guided Step-by-step
Explanation method that augments any image classification dataset with MCoTs by
reformulating the concept-based representations from Concept Bottleneck Models
(CBMs) into concise, interpretable reasoning chains under weak supervision.
Experiments across ten datasets show that our generated MCoTs not only improve
interpretability by 37% but also lead to gains in classification accuracy when
used to fine-tune MLLMs. Our work bridges concept-based interpretability and
generative MCoT reasoning, providing a generalizable framework for enhancing
MLLMs in fine-grained visual understanding.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有方法依赖闭源模型、缺乏系统推理能力以及在长视频问答任务中表现不佳的问题。

Method: 设计高效视觉模块支持长视频任务，构建快慢推理数据集训练开源模型FS-LLM，采用两阶段推理机制（快速推理和慢速推理），并在训练和推理阶段通过参数搜索优化视觉程序。

Result: 在LVBench上达到50.4%准确率，超越GPT-4o，在VideoMME上与Qwen2.5VL-72B性能相当，同时提高了效率和可靠性。

Conclusion: FS-VisPR框架通过自适应快慢推理机制，有效平衡了视觉程序工作流的效率和可靠性，为长视频问答任务提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in generating program
workflows for visual tasks. However, previous approaches often rely on
closed-source models, lack systematic reasoning, and struggle with long-form
video question answering (videoQA). To address these challenges, we introduce
the FS-VisPR framework, an adaptive visual program reasoning approach that
balances fast reasoning for simple queries with slow reasoning for difficult
ones. First, we design efficient visual modules (e.g., key clip retrieval and
subtitle retrieval) to support long-form video tasks. Then, we construct a
diverse and high-quality fast-slow reasoning dataset with a strong LLM to align
open-source language models' ability to generate visual program workflows as
FS-LLM. Next, we design a fast-slow reasoning framework with FS-LLM: Simple
queries are directly solved by VideoLLMs, while difficult ones invoke visual
program reasoning, motivated by human-like reasoning processes. During this
process, low-confidence fast-thinking answers will trigger a second-stage
slow-reasoning process, and a fallback mechanism to fast reasoning is activated
if the program execution fails. Moreover, we improve visual programs through
parameter search during both training and inference. By adjusting the
parameters of the visual modules within the program, multiple variants are
generated: during training, programs that yield correct answers are selected,
while during inference, the program with the highest confidence result is
applied. Experiments show that FS-VisPR improves both efficiency and
reliability in visual program workflows. It achieves 50.4% accuracy on LVBench,
surpassing GPT-4o, matching the performance of Qwen2.5VL-72B on VideoMME.

Motivation: 解决现有无模态补全方法在数据需求、泛化能力和渐进式管道中的错误累积问题，提升图像编辑和AR应用中的遮挡对象补全质量。

Method: 使用多智能体协作推理框架，分析遮挡关系确定边界扩展，生成精确的修复掩码；同时通过智能体生成细粒度文本描述，实现语义指导；基于扩散变换器的可见掩码和注意力图直接生成分层RGBA输出。

Result: 广泛评估表明该框架在视觉质量上达到最先进水平，能够准确合成对象并避免生成遮挡物或其他不需要的元素。

Conclusion: 提出的协作多智能体推理框架有效解决了无模态补全的关键挑战，在视觉质量和准确性方面表现出色，为图像编辑和AR应用提供了可靠解决方案。

Abstract: Amodal completion, generating invisible parts of occluded objects, is vital
for applications like image editing and AR. Prior methods face challenges with
data needs, generalization, or error accumulation in progressive pipelines. We
propose a Collaborative Multi-Agent Reasoning Framework based on upfront
collaborative reasoning to overcome these issues. Our framework uses multiple
agents to collaboratively analyze occlusion relationships and determine
necessary boundary expansion, yielding a precise mask for inpainting.
Concurrently, an agent generates fine-grained textual descriptions, enabling
Fine-Grained Semantic Guidance. This ensures accurate object synthesis and
prevents the regeneration of occluders or other unwanted elements, especially
within large inpainting areas. Furthermore, our method directly produces
layered RGBA outputs guided by visible masks and attention maps from a
Diffusion Transformer, eliminating extra segmentation. Extensive evaluations
demonstrate our framework achieves state-of-the-art visual quality.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Neural-MMGS是一个新颖的神经3D高斯框架，通过将多模态数据融合到紧凑的可学习嵌入中，实现大规模场景重建，降低了内存开销并提高了可扩展性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大规模场景重建方法虽然整合了LiDAR数据，但未充分利用其丰富的物理属性；语义信息仅用于对象检索，未用于提供高层上下文。传统方法将多模态属性作为独立参数附加到高斯模型，导致内存使用增加且模态间信息交换受限。

Method: 提出将图像、LiDAR和语义等多模态数据融合到每个高斯的紧凑可学习嵌入中，隐式编码光学、物理和语义特征。然后训练轻量级神经解码器将这些嵌入映射到高斯参数，实现多模态重建。

Result: 在Oxford Spires数据集上实现了更高质量的重建，在KITTI-360数据集上达到了与当前LiDAR新视角合成方法竞争的结果，同时存储消耗更少。

Conclusion: Neural-MMGS通过多模态融合的紧凑嵌入表示，在保持重建质量的同时显著降低了内存需求，为大规模场景重建提供了更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: This paper proposes Neural-MMGS, a novel neural 3DGS framework for multimodal
large-scale scene reconstruction that fuses multiple sensing modalities in a
per-gaussian compact, learnable embedding. While recent works focusing on
large-scale scene reconstruction have incorporated LiDAR data to provide more
accurate geometric constraints, we argue that LiDAR's rich physical properties
remain underexplored. Similarly, semantic information has been used for object
retrieval, but could provide valuable high-level context for scene
reconstruction. Traditional approaches append these properties to Gaussians as
separate parameters, increasing memory usage and limiting information exchange
across modalities. Instead, our approach fuses all modalities -- image, LiDAR,
and semantics -- into a compact, learnable embedding that implicitly encodes
optical, physical, and semantic features in each Gaussian. We then train
lightweight neural decoders to map these embeddings to Gaussian parameters,
enabling the reconstruction of each sensing modality with lower memory overhead
and improved scalability. We evaluate Neural-MMGS on the Oxford Spires and
KITTI-360 datasets. On Oxford Spires, we achieve higher-quality
reconstructions, while on KITTI-360, our method reaches competitive results
with less storage consumption compared with current approaches in LiDAR-based
novel-view synthesis.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种名为RPLIF的新型脉冲神经元模型，通过在LIF神经元中引入不应期机制来更好地模拟生物神经元特性，在多个神经形态数据集上实现了最先进的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的SNN神经元模型（如IF和LIF）忽略了生物神经元的不应期特性，这可能导致神经元过度兴奋和异常信号干扰。不应期机制对于防止过度兴奋和减轻异常信号干扰至关重要。

Method: 提出RPLIF方法，通过脉冲触发的阈值动态将不应期整合到LIF神经元中。这种方法简单有效，计算效率高，能够确保每个脉冲准确编码神经信息。

Result: RPLIF在Cifar10-DVS上达到82.40%，N-Caltech101上达到83.35%，DVS128 Gesture上达到97.22%的优异性能，且使用更少的时间步长和低延迟。

Conclusion: 将不应期整合到LIF神经元中是无缝且计算高效的，能够增强鲁棒性和效率，在可忽略的开销下获得更好的性能，实现了最先进的性能表现。

Abstract: As the third generation of neural networks, spiking neural networks (SNNs)
have recently gained widespread attention for their biological plausibility,
energy efficiency, and effectiveness in processing neuromorphic datasets. To
better emulate biological neurons, various models such as Integrate-and-Fire
(IF) and Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) have been widely adopted in SNNs.
However, these neuron models overlook the refractory period, a fundamental
characteristic of biological neurons. Research on excitable neurons reveal that
after firing, neurons enter a refractory period during which they are
temporarily unresponsive to subsequent stimuli. This mechanism is critical for
preventing over-excitation and mitigating interference from aberrant signals.
Therefore, we propose a simple yet effective method to incorporate the
refractory period into spiking LIF neurons through spike-triggered threshold
dynamics, termed RPLIF. Our method ensures that each spike accurately encodes
neural information, effectively preventing neuron over-excitation under
continuous inputs and interference from anomalous inputs. Incorporating the
refractory period into LIF neurons is seamless and computationally efficient,
enhancing robustness and efficiency while yielding better performance with
negligible overhead. To the best of our knowledge, RPLIF achieves
state-of-the-art performance on Cifar10-DVS(82.40%) and N-Caltech101(83.35%)
with fewer timesteps and demonstrates superior performance on DVS128
Gesture(97.22%) at low latency.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种针对图像到视频生成（I2V）的跨模态水印框架I2VWM，通过引入鲁棒扩散距离概念和视频模拟噪声层，解决了现有水印方法在I2V场景下无法追踪源图像的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着图像引导视频生成技术的快速发展，其在错误信息和欺诈中的潜在滥用风险日益凸显，迫切需要有效的数字水印技术来追踪源图像。

Method: 提出鲁棒扩散距离概念来衡量生成视频中水印信号的时间持续性；设计I2VWM框架，在训练时使用视频模拟噪声层，在推理时采用基于光流的对齐模块。

Result: 在开源和商业I2V模型上的实验表明，I2VWM在保持不可感知性的同时显著提高了水印的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: I2VWM为生成视频时代的跨模态水印建立了新范式，代码已开源发布。

Abstract: The rapid progress of image-guided video generation (I2V) has raised concerns
about its potential misuse in misinformation and fraud, underscoring the urgent
need for effective digital watermarking. While existing watermarking methods
demonstrate robustness within a single modality, they fail to trace source
images in I2V settings. To address this gap, we introduce the concept of Robust
Diffusion Distance, which measures the temporal persistence of watermark
signals in generated videos. Building on this, we propose I2VWM, a cross-modal
watermarking framework designed to enhance watermark robustness across time.
I2VWM leverages a video-simulation noise layer during training and employs an
optical-flow-based alignment module during inference. Experiments on both
open-source and commercial I2V models demonstrate that I2VWM significantly
improves robustness while maintaining imperceptibility, establishing a new
paradigm for cross-modal watermarking in the era of generative video.

TL;DR: R-Splatting是一个统一框架，将水下图像恢复与3D高斯泼溅相结合，通过多视图增强、轻量级光照生成器和不确定性感知优化来提高水下3D重建的渲染质量和几何精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 水下图像退化对3D重建构成重大挑战，传统简化物理模型在复杂场景中往往失效。需要一种能够同时处理图像恢复和3D重建的统一方法。

Method: 1）集成多种水下图像恢复模型生成增强视图；2）使用轻量级光照生成器采样潜在代码支持多样化渲染；3）采用对比损失确保解耦稳定的光照表示；4）提出不确定性感知不透明度优化，将不透明度建模为随机函数来正则化训练。

Conclusion: 该方法成功地将水下图像恢复与3D高斯泼溅相结合，通过统一框架有效解决了复杂水下场景中的3D重建挑战。

Abstract: Underwater image degradation poses significant challenges for 3D
reconstruction, where simplified physical models often fail in complex scenes.
We propose \textbf{R-Splatting}, a unified framework that bridges underwater
image restoration (UIR) with 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) to improve both
rendering quality and geometric fidelity. Our method integrates multiple
enhanced views produced by diverse UIR models into a single reconstruction
pipeline. During inference, a lightweight illumination generator samples latent
codes to support diverse yet coherent renderings, while a contrastive loss
ensures disentangled and stable illumination representations. Furthermore, we
propose \textit{Uncertainty-Aware Opacity Optimization (UAOO)}, which models
opacity as a stochastic function to regularize training. This suppresses abrupt
gradient responses triggered by illumination variation and mitigates
overfitting to noisy or view-specific artifacts. Experiments on Seathru-NeRF
and our new BlueCoral3D dataset demonstrate that R-Splatting outperforms strong
baselines in both rendering quality and geometric accuracy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界图像常受多种空间多样化退化影响，现有方法依赖外部文本提示或手工架构先验，这些离散假设限制了在未见或混合退化情况下的泛化能力。

Method: 将全能图像恢复重构为学习潜在先验推理问题，设计轻量级解码模块，通过自适应特征选择、空间定位和退化语义分析实现空间自适应恢复。

Result: 在六种常见退化任务、五种复合设置和未见退化情况下，该方法比现有最优方法平均PSNR提升1.68 dB，效率提高三倍。

Conclusion: 基于学习潜在先验推理的方法能够有效解决全能图像恢复问题，在性能和效率方面均优于现有方法。

Abstract: Real-world images often suffer from spatially diverse degradations such as
haze, rain, snow, and low-light, significantly impacting visual quality and
downstream vision tasks. Existing all-in-one restoration (AIR) approaches
either depend on external text prompts or embed hand-crafted architectural
priors (e.g., frequency heuristics); both impose discrete, brittle assumptions
that weaken generalization to unseen or mixed degradations. To address this
limitation, we propose to reframe AIR as learned latent prior inference, where
degradation-aware representations are automatically inferred from the input
without explicit task cues. Based on latent priors, we formulate AIR as a
structured reasoning paradigm: (1) which features to route (adaptive feature
selection), (2) where to restore (spatial localization), and (3) what to
restore (degradation semantics). We design a lightweight decoding module that
efficiently leverages these latent encoded cues for spatially-adaptive
restoration. Extensive experiments across six common degradation tasks, five
compound settings, and previously unseen degradations demonstrate that our
method outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches, achieving an average
PSNR improvement of 1.68 dB while being three times more efficient.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 目前缺乏关于相机视角如何影响2D无标记步态分析准确性的系统性证据，这限制了该方法在临床实践中的有效应用。

Method: 使用18名受试者的步态数据，同时记录正面、侧面和3D运动捕捉数据。采用YOLOv8进行姿态估计，使用DTW、MCC、KLD和IE四种指标评估一致性，并进行统计显著性检验。

Result: 侧面视角在步长和膝关节旋转等矢状面运动学参数上显著优于正面视角，而正面视角在躯干旋转和手腕到髋部中点距离等对称性参数上表现更好，效应量为中等至大。

Conclusion: 相机视角对步态参数准确性有重要影响，侧面视角适合矢状面运动学分析，正面视角适合躯干对称性评估，未来应基于疾病特点采用双视角设置。

Abstract: Objective: To systematically quantify the effect of the camera view (frontal
vs. lateral) on the accuracy of 2D markerless gait analysis relative to 3D
motion capture ground truth. Methods: Gait data from 18 subjects were recorded
simultaneously using frontal, lateral and 3D motion capture systems. Pose
estimation used YOLOv8. Four metrics were assessed to evaluate agreement:
Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) for temporal alignment, Maximum Cross-Correlation
(MCC) for signal similarity, Kullback-Leibler Divergence (KLD) for distribution
differences, and Information Entropy (IE) for complexity. Wilcoxon signed-rank
tests (significance: $p < 0.05$) and Cliff's delta ($\delta$) were used to
measure statistical differences and effect sizes. Results: Lateral views
significantly outperformed frontal views for sagittal plane kinematics: step
length (DTW: $53.08 \pm 24.50$ vs. $69.87 \pm 25.36$, $p = 0.005$) and knee
rotation (DTW: $106.46 \pm 38.57$ vs. $155.41 \pm 41.77$, $p = 0.004$). Frontal
views were superior for symmetry parameters: trunk rotation (KLD: $0.09 \pm
0.06$ vs. $0.30 \pm 0.19$, $p < 0.001$) and wrist-to-hipmid distance (MCC:
$105.77 \pm 29.72$ vs. $75.20 \pm 20.38$, $p = 0.003$). Effect sizes were
medium-to-large ($\delta: 0.34$--$0.76$). Conclusion: Camera view critically
impacts gait parameter accuracy. Lateral views are optimal for sagittal
kinematics; frontal views excel for trunk symmetry. Significance: This first
systematic evidence enables data-driven camera deployment in 2D gait analysis,
enhancing clinical utility. Future implementations should leverage both views
via disease-oriented setups.

Motivation: 当前自监督学习主要基于通用数据集（如ImageNet）进行预训练，但在数据有限的新领域中进行自监督预训练，特别是针对密集预测任务（如语义分割）的研究仍然不足。

Method: 提出GLARE（全局局部和区域强化）方法，包含：1）局部一致性约束（通过补丁级增强）；2）区域一致性约束（利用空间语义）；3）使用UniAdapter轻量级适配器进行参数高效的持续预训练，仅更新适配器模块而冻结主干网络。

Result: 在多个语义分割基准测试中，GLARE方法在不同领域上一致提升了下游性能，同时计算和参数开销最小。

Conclusion: GLARE提供了一种有效的数据高效方法，将视觉基础模型适应到新领域，特别适用于语义分割任务，在保持高性能的同时显著降低了计算成本。

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has emerged as a central paradigm for training
foundation models by leveraging large-scale unlabeled datasets, often producing
representations with strong generalization capabilities. These models are
typically pre-trained on general-purpose datasets such as ImageNet and
subsequently adapted to various downstream tasks through finetuning. While
recent advances have explored parameter-efficient strategies for adapting
pre-trained models, extending SSL pre-training itself to new domains -
particularly under limited data regimes and for dense prediction tasks -
remains underexplored. In this work, we address the problem of adapting vision
foundation models to new domains in an unsupervised and data-efficient manner,
specifically targeting downstream semantic segmentation. We propose GLARE
(Global Local and Regional Enforcement), a novel continual self-supervised
pre-training task designed to enhance downstream segmentation performance.
GLARE introduces patch-level augmentations to encourage local consistency and
incorporates a regional consistency constraint that leverages spatial semantics
in the data. For efficient continual pre-training, we initialize Vision
Transformers (ViTs) with weights from existing SSL models and update only
lightweight adapter modules - specifically UniAdapter - while keeping the rest
of the backbone frozen. Experiments across multiple semantic segmentation
benchmarks on different domains demonstrate that GLARE consistently improves
downstream performance with minimal computational and parameter overhead.

TL;DR: ContextFlow是一个无需训练的基于DiT的视频对象编辑框架，通过高阶Rectified Flow求解器和自适应上下文增强机制，解决了现有方法在保真度和时间一致性方面的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的无需训练视频对象编辑方法存在两个主要限制：一阶求解器导致的反转不准确，以及粗糙的"硬"特征替换引起的上下文冲突。这些问题在Diffusion Transformers（DiTs）中更为严重，因为先前的层选择启发式方法不适用。

Method: 1）使用高阶Rectified Flow求解器建立稳健的编辑基础；2）提出自适应上下文增强机制，通过并行重建和编辑路径的Key-Value对连接来丰富自注意力上下文；3）基于Guidance Responsiveness Metric进行数据驱动分析，识别任务特定的关键层。

Result: 大量实验表明，ContextFlow显著优于现有的无需训练方法，甚至超过几种最先进的基于训练的方法，能够生成时间一致、高保真的结果。

Conclusion: ContextFlow通过创新的自适应上下文增强和系统性的层选择策略，成功解决了DiT-based视频对象编辑中的关键挑战，为训练自由的视频编辑提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Training-free video object editing aims to achieve precise object-level
manipulation, including object insertion, swapping, and deletion. However, it
faces significant challenges in maintaining fidelity and temporal consistency.
Existing methods, often designed for U-Net architectures, suffer from two
primary limitations: inaccurate inversion due to first-order solvers, and
contextual conflicts caused by crude "hard" feature replacement. These issues
are more challenging in Diffusion Transformers (DiTs), where the unsuitability
of prior layer-selection heuristics makes effective guidance challenging. To
address these limitations, we introduce ContextFlow, a novel training-free
framework for DiT-based video object editing. In detail, we first employ a
high-order Rectified Flow solver to establish a robust editing foundation. The
core of our framework is Adaptive Context Enrichment (for specifying what to
edit), a mechanism that addresses contextual conflicts. Instead of replacing
features, it enriches the self-attention context by concatenating Key-Value
pairs from parallel reconstruction and editing paths, empowering the model to
dynamically fuse information. Additionally, to determine where to apply this
enrichment (for specifying where to edit), we propose a systematic, data-driven
analysis to identify task-specific vital layers. Based on a novel Guidance
Responsiveness Metric, our method pinpoints the most influential DiT blocks for
different tasks (e.g., insertion, swapping), enabling targeted and highly
effective guidance. Extensive experiments show that ContextFlow significantly
outperforms existing training-free methods and even surpasses several
state-of-the-art training-based approaches, delivering temporally coherent,
high-fidelity results.

Method: 使用潜在扩散模型，采用新颖的双条件方法，将语义分割图与组织特异性视觉裁剪相结合。对于未标注数据，引入自监督扩展，使用基础模型嵌入将全玻片图像聚类为100种组织类型，自动生成伪语义图进行训练。

Result: 在Camelyon16数据集上，提示引导合成将Frechet距离从430.1降低到72.0（6倍改进），在Panda和TCGA数据集上FD降低2-3倍。仅使用合成数据训练的DeepLabv3+模型在Camelyon16和Panda上的测试IoU分别达到0.71和0.95，接近真实数据基线（0.72和0.96）。

Conclusion: 该框架通过扩展到11,765个TCGA全玻片图像而无需手动标注，为生成多样化、标注的组织病理学数据提供了实用解决方案，解决了计算病理学中的关键瓶颈。

Abstract: Synthetic data generation in histopathology faces unique challenges:
preserving tissue heterogeneity, capturing subtle morphological features, and
scaling to unannotated datasets. We present a latent diffusion model that
generates realistic heterogeneous histopathology images through a novel
dual-conditioning approach combining semantic segmentation maps with
tissue-specific visual crops. Unlike existing methods that rely on text prompts
or abstract visual embeddings, our approach preserves critical morphological
details by directly incorporating raw tissue crops from corresponding semantic
regions. For annotated datasets (i.e., Camelyon16, Panda), we extract patches
ensuring 20-80% tissue heterogeneity. For unannotated data (i.e., TCGA), we
introduce a self-supervised extension that clusters whole-slide images into 100
tissue types using foundation model embeddings, automatically generating
pseudo-semantic maps for training. Our method synthesizes high-fidelity images
with precise region-wise annotations, achieving superior performance on
downstream segmentation tasks. When evaluated on annotated datasets, models
trained on our synthetic data show competitive performance to those trained on
real data, demonstrating the utility of controlled heterogeneous tissue
generation. In quantitative evaluation, prompt-guided synthesis reduces Frechet
Distance by up to 6X on Camelyon16 (from 430.1 to 72.0) and yields 2-3x lower
FD across Panda and TCGA. Downstream DeepLabv3+ models trained solely on
synthetic data attain test IoU of 0.71 and 0.95 on Camelyon16 and Panda, within
1-2% of real-data baselines (0.72 and 0.96). By scaling to 11,765 TCGA
whole-slide images without manual annotations, our framework offers a practical
solution for an urgent need for generating diverse, annotated histopathology
data, addressing a critical bottleneck in computational pathology.

*Shi Chen,Erik Sandström,Sandro Lombardi,Siyuan Li,Martin R. Oswald*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种在线动态场景重建方法，通过SLAM系统中静态和动态部分的解耦，实现了对RGB和RGB-D输入的灵活处理，具有全局一致性和细节外观建模能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SLAM方法通常仅移除动态部分或需要RGB-D输入，离线方法无法扩展到长视频序列，而基于transformer的前馈方法缺乏全局一致性和外观细节。

Method: 在SLAM系统中解耦静态和动态部分，采用新颖的运动掩码策略进行鲁棒姿态跟踪，并利用渐进式适应的运动支架图重建动态部分。

Result: 方法能够生成与离线方法相竞争的新视角渲染效果，并在跟踪性能上与最先进的动态SLAM方法相当。

Conclusion: 该方法实现了真正实用的动态3D重建，具备在线操作、全局姿态和地图一致性、详细外观建模等关键特性。

Abstract: Achieving truly practical dynamic 3D reconstruction requires online
operation, global pose and map consistency, detailed appearance modeling, and
the flexibility to handle both RGB and RGB-D inputs. However, existing SLAM
methods typically merely remove the dynamic parts or require RGB-D input, while
offline methods are not scalable to long video sequences, and current
transformer-based feedforward methods lack global consistency and appearance
details. To this end, we achieve online dynamic scene reconstruction by
disentangling the static and dynamic parts within a SLAM system. The poses are
tracked robustly with a novel motion masking strategy, and dynamic parts are
reconstructed leveraging a progressive adaptation of a Motion Scaffolds graph.
Our method yields novel view renderings competitive to offline methods and
achieves on-par tracking with state-of-the-art dynamic SLAM methods.

*Geewook Kim,Minjoon Seo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文研究发现当前视频大语言模型的评估基准大多忽略音频信息，通过实验证明音频对现有基准贡献有限，但在音频敏感任务中至关重要。作者开发了包含音频编码器和token压缩器的模型，并发布了新的音频敏感评估数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型声称具备"视频理解"能力，但大多数评估使用静音视频或丢弃音频信息。作者质疑音频对视频理解的实际重要性，并希望填补学术评估与现实期望之间的差距。

Method: 基于LLaVA-OneVision架构，附加语音/音频编码器（如Whisper），使用轻量级Mamba状态空间token压缩器处理音频token爆炸问题，并在音频敏感子集上进行测试。

Result: 研究发现音频在现有视频基准上提升有限，但在精心策划的音频敏感子集上具有决定性作用。作者发布了AVQA-Hard和Music-AVQA-Hard数据集来支持忠实评估。

Conclusion: 当前学术实践与现实期望存在差距，音频在真实视频理解中至关重要。作者提供了可扩展的音频-视觉视频大语言模型实用工具，并将完全开源相关工作。

Abstract: Modern multimodal large language models often claim "video understanding,"
yet most evaluations use muted videos or simply discard audio. We ask a direct
question: how much does audio actually matter for contemporary Video-LLMs and
the benchmarks that certify them? We audit widely used suites and observe that
many items are even solvable from a single frame, rendering audio largely
redundant. Building on LLaVA-OneVision architecture, we attach a speech/audio
encoder (e.g., Whisper) and analyze when audio helps, while addressing audio
token explosion with a lightweight Mamba-based state-space token compressor. We
find that audio yields minimal gains on recent video benchmarks but is decisive
on curated, audio-sensitive subsets. To enable faithful evaluation, we release
AVQA-Hard and Music-AVQA-Hard, our model, and code. Our findings surface a
growing gap between current academic practice and real-world expectations, and
provide practical tools for scalable audio-visual Video-LLMs. We will fully
open-source our work at https://github.com/naver-ai/LLaVA-AV-SSM.

TL;DR: SmaRT是一个用于脑肿瘤MRI分割的源自由测试时自适应框架，通过风格调制增强、双分支动量策略和结构先验来解决域偏移问题，在低资源和儿科数据集上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的脑肿瘤MRI分割模型在域偏移（如扫描仪和协议差异）下表现不佳，特别是在低资源和儿科队列中，传统的测试时或源自由自适应策略存在不稳定和结构不一致的问题。

Method: SmaRT框架整合了风格感知增强来减少外观差异，采用双分支动量策略进行稳定的伪标签细化，并引入结构先验来确保一致性、完整性和连通性。

Result: 在撒哈拉以南非洲和儿科胶质瘤数据集上的广泛评估表明，SmaRT在Dice准确率和边界精度方面显著优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: SmaRT弥合了算法进步与公平临床适用性之间的差距，支持MRI神经肿瘤工具在不同临床环境中的稳健部署。

Abstract: Reliable brain tumor segmentation in MRI is indispensable for treatment
planning and outcome monitoring, yet models trained on curated benchmarks often
fail under domain shifts arising from scanner and protocol variability as well
as population heterogeneity. Such gaps are especially severe in low-resource
and pediatric cohorts, where conventional test-time or source-free adaptation
strategies often suffer from instability and structural inconsistency. We
propose SmaRT, a style-modulated robust test-time adaptation framework that
enables source-free cross-domain generalization. SmaRT integrates style-aware
augmentation to mitigate appearance discrepancies, a dual-branch momentum
strategy for stable pseudo-label refinement, and structural priors enforcing
consistency, integrity, and connectivity. This synergy ensures both adaptation
stability and anatomical fidelity under extreme domain shifts. Extensive
evaluations on sub-Saharan Africa and pediatric glioma datasets show that SmaRT
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods, with notable gains in Dice
accuracy and boundary precision. Overall, SmaRT bridges the gap between
algorithmic advances and equitable clinical applicability, supporting robust
deployment of MRI-based neuro-oncology tools in diverse clinical environments.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的针头定位方法，将多针定位重新定义为针尖-针柄检测和匹配问题，使用基于HRNet的无锚网络提取多尺度特征，并通过贪婪匹配合并方法重建3D针路径。


<details>

Motivation: 术中CT图像中准确的多针定位对于盆腔种子植入近距离放疗中优化种子放置至关重要，但由于图像对比度差和针头粘连，这项任务具有挑战性。

Method: 提出基于HRNet的无锚网络提取多尺度特征，通过热图回归和极角预测的解耦分支检测针尖和针柄中心及方向；使用贪婪匹配合并方法解决带约束的不平衡分配问题，迭代选择最可能的针尖-针柄对并基于距离度量合并。

Result: 在100名患者数据集上评估，该方法相比基于nnUNet模型的分割方法表现出更优性能，实现了更高的精确度和F1分数。

Conclusion: 该方法为复杂临床场景中的针定位提供了更稳健和准确的解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate multi-needle localization in intraoperative CT images is crucial for
optimizing seed placement in pelvic seed implant brachytherapy. However, this
task is challenging due to poor image contrast and needle adhesion. This paper
presents a novel approach that reframes needle localization as a tip-handle
detection and matching problem to overcome these difficulties. An anchor-free
network, based on HRNet, is proposed to extract multi-scale features and
accurately detect needle tips and handles by predicting their centers and
orientations using decoupled branches for heatmap regression and polar angle
prediction. To associate detected tips and handles into individual needles, a
greedy matching and merging (GMM) method designed to solve the unbalanced
assignment problem with constraints (UAP-C) is presented. The GMM method
iteratively selects the most probable tip-handle pairs and merges them based on
a distance metric to reconstruct 3D needle paths. Evaluated on a dataset of 100
patients, the proposed method demonstrates superior performance, achieving
higher precision and F1 score compared to a segmentation-based method utilizing
the nnUNet model,thereby offering a more robust and accurate solution for
needle localization in complex clinical scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有分割方法在倾斜遥感图像中表现不佳，因为屋顶和足迹存在显著位移，而OpenStreetMap等历史标签存在位置偏差且只有单一标注，无法准确描述建筑结构。

Method: 提出对齐标记概念编码校正向量，将标签对齐建模为高斯分布下的交互式去噪过程，训练时通过随机高斯扰动模拟错位，推理时迭代优化输入标签位置。

Result: 在包含179,265个建筑的新数据集ReBO上进行实验，验证了DragOSM的有效性。

Conclusion: DragOSM能够有效纠正历史标签的位置偏差，为倾斜遥感图像中的建筑物提取提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: Extracting polygonal roofs and footprints from remote sensing images is
critical for large-scale urban analysis. Most existing methods rely on
segmentation-based models that assume clear semantic boundaries of roofs, but
these approaches struggle in off- nadir images, where the roof and footprint
are significantly displaced, and facade pixels are fused with the roof
boundary. With the increasing availability of open vector map annotations,
e.g., OpenStreetMap, utilizing historical labels for off-nadir image annotation
has become viable because remote sensing images are georeferenced once
captured. However, these historical labels commonly suffer from significant
positional discrepancies with new images and only have one annotation (roof or
footprint), which fails to describe the correct structures of a building. To
address these discrepancies, we first introduce a concept of an alignment
token, which encodes the correction vector to guide the label correction. Based
on this concept, we then propose Drag OpenStreetMap Labels (DragOSM), a novel
model designed to align dislocated historical labels with roofs and footprints.
Specifically, DragOSM formulates the label alignment as an interactive
denoising process, modeling the positional discrepancy as a Gaussian
distribution. During training, it learns to correct these errors by simulating
misalignment with random Gaussian perturbations; during inference, it
iteratively refines the positions of input labels. To validate our method, we
further present a new dataset, Repairing Buildings in OSM (ReBO), comprising
179,265 buildings with both OpenStreetMap and manually corrected annotations
across 5,473 images from 41 cities. Experimental results on ReBO demonstrate
the effectiveness of DragOSM. Code, dataset, and trained models are publicly
available at https://github.com/likaiucas/DragOSM.git.

TL;DR: CoPS是一种纯粹数据驱动的方法，用于从部分观测中有效建模连续物理模拟，通过多尺度图ODE和神经自校正模块实现时空连续建模。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据驱动方法受限于固定的时空离散化，难以从稀疏、无结构的观测中捕捉高度非线性特征，需要真正克服离散化限制的连续建模方法。

Method: 使用乘法滤波器网络融合空间信息和观测数据，定制几何网格并通过消息传递机制映射特征，设计多尺度图ODE建模连续时间动力学，引入基于马尔可夫的神经自校正模块辅助连续外推。

Result: 综合实验表明CoPS在各种场景下的时空连续建模方面优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: CoPS成功实现了从部分观测中连续物理模拟的有效建模，为复杂时变物理动力学的数据驱动建模提供了新思路。

Abstract: The modeling of complicated time-evolving physical dynamics from partial
observations is a long-standing challenge. Particularly, observations can be
sparsely distributed in a seemingly random or unstructured manner, making it
difficult to capture highly nonlinear features in a variety of scientific and
engineering problems. However, existing data-driven approaches are often
constrained by fixed spatial and temporal discretization. While some
researchers attempt to achieve spatio-temporal continuity by designing novel
strategies, they either overly rely on traditional numerical methods or fail to
truly overcome the limitations imposed by discretization. To address these, we
propose CoPS, a purely data-driven methods, to effectively model continuous
physics simulation from partial observations. Specifically, we employ
multiplicative filter network to fuse and encode spatial information with the
corresponding observations. Then we customize geometric grids and use
message-passing mechanism to map features from original spatial domain to the
customized grids. Subsequently, CoPS models continuous-time dynamics by
designing multi-scale graph ODEs, while introducing a Markov-based neural
auto-correction module to assist and constrain the continuous extrapolations.
Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that CoPS advances the state-of-the-art
methods in space-time continuous modeling across various scenarios.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种主动的基于检测判别式的网络压缩方法，用于深度视觉检测器，通过最大化检测相关判别式并追踪其重要性来压缩模型，在保持性能的同时大幅降低复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络在资源受限的边缘设备上部署受限，现有剪枝方法主要关注分类模型，对检测模型关注有限，且缺乏对定位信息的利用，同时被动依赖预训练模型导致有用和无用组件交织难以分离。

Method: 交替执行两个步骤：(1)最大化并压缩检测相关判别式，将其与检测头前的神经元/滤波器子集对齐；(2)跨层追踪检测相关判别能力，丢弃重要性较低的特征。两个步骤都利用了目标定位信息。

Result: 在KITTI和COCO数据集上使用四种先进检测模型和四种竞争方法的广泛实验表明，该方法具有优越性，压缩后的模型甚至能在复杂度大幅降低的情况下超越原始基础模型。

Conclusion: 该方法通过主动利用检测判别式和定位信息，实现了对深度视觉检测器的有效压缩，在保持甚至提升性能的同时显著降低了模型复杂度。

Abstract: Deep neural networks are powerful, yet their high complexity greatly limits
their potential to be deployed on billions of resource-constrained edge
devices. Pruning is a crucial network compression technique, yet most existing
methods focus on classification models, with limited attention to detection.
Even among those addressing detection, there is a lack of utilization of
essential localization information. Also, many pruning methods passively rely
on pre-trained models, in which useful and useless components are intertwined,
making it difficult to remove the latter without harming the former at the
neuron/filter level. To address the above issues, in this paper, we propose a
proactive detection-discriminants-based network compression approach for deep
visual detectors, which alternates between two steps: (1) maximizing and
compressing detection-related discriminants and aligning them with a subset of
neurons/filters immediately before the detection head, and (2) tracing the
detection-related discriminating power across the layers and discarding
features of lower importance. Object location information is exploited in both
steps. Extensive experiments, employing four advanced detection models and four
state-of-the-art competing methods on the KITTI and COCO datasets, highlight
the superiority of our approach. Remarkably, our compressed models can even
beat the original base models with a substantial reduction in complexity.

Result: 大量实验表明，StableGuard在图像保真度、水印验证和篡改定位方面持续优于最先进方法。

Conclusion: StableGuard提供了一个有效的端到端解决方案，解决了AI生成内容的版权保护和篡改检测问题，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: The advancement of diffusion models has enhanced the realism of AI-generated
content but also raised concerns about misuse, necessitating robust copyright
protection and tampering localization. Although recent methods have made
progress toward unified solutions, their reliance on post hoc processing
introduces considerable application inconvenience and compromises forensic
reliability. We propose StableGuard, a novel framework that seamlessly
integrates a binary watermark into the diffusion generation process, ensuring
copyright protection and tampering localization in Latent Diffusion Models
through an end-to-end design. We develop a Multiplexing Watermark VAE (MPW-VAE)
by equipping a pretrained Variational Autoencoder (VAE) with a lightweight
latent residual-based adapter, enabling the generation of paired watermarked
and watermark-free images. These pairs, fused via random masks, create a
diverse dataset for training a tampering-agnostic forensic network. To further
enhance forensic synergy, we introduce a Mixture-of-Experts Guided Forensic
Network (MoE-GFN) that dynamically integrates holistic watermark patterns,
local tampering traces, and frequency-domain cues for precise watermark
verification and tampered region detection. The MPW-VAE and MoE-GFN are jointly
optimized in a self-supervised, end-to-end manner, fostering a reciprocal
training between watermark embedding and forensic accuracy. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that StableGuard consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in image fidelity, watermark verification, and
tampering localization.

TL;DR: NeuS-QA是一个训练即插即用的神经符号管道，用于解决长视频问答（LVQA）中的复杂查询问题，通过将自然语言问题转换为时序逻辑表达式，构建视频自动机，并应用模型检查来识别满足逻辑要求的视频片段，从而提高性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统视觉问答（VQA）方法在长视频问答（LVQA）中表现不佳，因为它们缺乏显式的时序表示和逻辑事件关系验证，导致模型错过细粒度视觉结构、事件转换或关键时序线索，从而产生错误答案。

Method: NeuS-QA将自然语言问题转换为形式时序逻辑表达式，从帧级语义命题构建视频自动机，并应用模型检查来严格识别满足问题逻辑要求的视频片段，仅将这些逻辑验证的片段提交给视觉语言模型（VLM）。

Result: 在LongVideoBench和CinePile上的实验表明，NeuS-QA将性能提高了10%以上，特别是在涉及事件排序、因果性和多步组合推理的问题上。

Conclusion: NeuS-QA通过引入神经符号方法，解决了LVQA中的时序推理和因果性问题，提高了可解释性、减少了幻觉，并实现了组合推理，而无需修改或微调模型。

Abstract: Long-Form Video Question Answering (LVQA) poses challenges beyond traditional
visual question answering (VQA), which is often limited to static images or
short video clips. While current vision-language models (VLMs) perform well in
those settings, they struggle with complex queries in LVQA over long videos
involving multi-step temporal reasoning and causality. Vanilla approaches,
which sample frames uniformly and feed them to a VLM with the question, incur
significant token overhead, forcing severe downsampling. As a result, the model
often misses fine-grained visual structure, subtle event transitions, or key
temporal cues, ultimately leading to incorrect answers. To address these
limitations, recent works have explored query-adaptive frame sampling,
hierarchical keyframe selection, and agent-based iterative querying. However,
these methods remain fundamentally heuristic: they lack explicit temporal
representations and cannot enforce or verify logical event relationships. As a
result, there are no formal guarantees that the sampled context actually
encodes the compositional or causal logic demanded by the question. To address
these foundational gaps, we introduce NeuS-QA, a training-free, plug-and-play
neuro-symbolic pipeline for LVQA. NeuS-QA translates a natural language
question into a formal temporal logic expression, constructs a video automaton
from frame-level semantic propositions, and applies model checking to
rigorously identify video segments satisfying the question's logical
requirements. Only these logic-verified segments are submitted to the VLM, thus
improving interpretability, reducing hallucinations, and enabling compositional
reasoning without modifying or fine-tuning the model. Experiments on
LongVideoBench and CinePile show NeuS-QA improves performance by over 10%,
especially on questions involving event ordering, causality, and multi-step
compositional reasoning.

TL;DR: TempSamp-R1是一个新的强化微调框架，用于提升多模态大语言模型在视频时序定位任务中的性能。它通过利用真实标注作为离策略监督来提供时序精确指导，并采用非线性软优势计算方法来稳定训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的强化学习方法（如GRPO）在大型时序搜索空间任务中效率低下且性能受限，因为它们主要依赖同策略采样，往往无法找到时序准确的解决方案。

Method: TempSamp-R1利用真实标注作为离策略监督来补偿同策略解决方案的稀疏性和不对齐问题，采用非线性软优势计算方法动态重塑奖励反馈，并通过混合Chain-of-Thought训练范式优化单一统一模型。

Result: 在基准数据集上表现优异：Charades-STA（R1@0.7: 52.9%, +2.7%）、ActivityNet Captions（R1@0.5: 56.0%, +5.3%）和QVHighlights（mAP: 30.0%, +3.0%），超越了GRPO基线方法。

Conclusion: TempSamp-R1在视频时序定位任务中实现了最先进的性能，并展示了在有限数据下的强大少样本泛化能力。

Abstract: This paper introduces TempSamp-R1, a new reinforcement fine-tuning framework
designed to improve the effectiveness of adapting multimodal large language
models (MLLMs) to video temporal grounding tasks. We reveal that existing
reinforcement learning methods, such as Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO), rely on on-policy sampling for policy updates. However, in tasks with
large temporal search spaces, this strategy becomes both inefficient and
limited in performance, as it often fails to identify temporally accurate
solutions. To address this limitation, TempSamp-R1 leverages ground-truth
annotations as off-policy supervision to provide temporally precise guidance,
effectively compensating for the sparsity and misalignment in on-policy
solutions. To further stabilize training and reduce variance in reward-based
updates, TempSamp-R1 provides a non-linear soft advantage computation method
that dynamically reshapes the reward feedback via an asymmetric transformation.
By employing a hybrid Chain-of-Thought (CoT) training paradigm, TempSamp-R1
optimizes a single unified model to support both CoT and non-CoT inference
modes, enabling efficient handling of queries with varying reasoning
complexity. Experimental results demonstrate that TempSamp-R1 outperforms
GRPO-based baselines, establishing new state-of-the-art performance on
benchmark datasets: Charades-STA (R1@0.7: 52.9%, +2.7%), ActivityNet Captions
(R1@0.5: 56.0%, +5.3%), and QVHighlights (mAP: 30.0%, +3.0%). Moreover,
TempSamp-R1 shows robust few-shot generalization capabilities under limited
data. Code: https://github.com/HVision-NKU/TempSamp-R1

Abstract: Despite Bengali being the sixth most spoken language in the world,
handwritten text recognition (HTR) systems for Bengali remain severely
underdeveloped. The complexity of Bengali script--featuring conjuncts,
diacritics, and highly variable handwriting styles--combined with a scarcity of
annotated datasets makes this task particularly challenging. We present
GraDeT-HTR, a resource-efficient Bengali handwritten text recognition system
based on a Grapheme-aware Decoder-only Transformer architecture. To address the
unique challenges of Bengali script, we augment the performance of a
decoder-only transformer by integrating a grapheme-based tokenizer and
demonstrate that it significantly improves recognition accuracy compared to
conventional subword tokenizers. Our model is pretrained on large-scale
synthetic data and fine-tuned on real human-annotated samples, achieving
state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmark datasets.

Abstract: Reconstructing accurate surfaces with radiance fields has achieved remarkable
progress in recent years. However, prevailing approaches, primarily based on
Gaussian Splatting, are increasingly constrained by representational
bottlenecks. In this paper, we introduce GeoSVR, an explicit voxel-based
framework that explores and extends the under-investigated potential of sparse
voxels for achieving accurate, detailed, and complete surface reconstruction.
As strengths, sparse voxels support preserving the coverage completeness and
geometric clarity, while corresponding challenges also arise from absent scene
constraints and locality in surface refinement. To ensure correct scene
convergence, we first propose a Voxel-Uncertainty Depth Constraint that
maximizes the effect of monocular depth cues while presenting a voxel-oriented
uncertainty to avoid quality degradation, enabling effective and robust scene
constraints yet preserving highly accurate geometries. Subsequently, Sparse
Voxel Surface Regularization is designed to enhance geometric consistency for
tiny voxels and facilitate the voxel-based formation of sharp and accurate
surfaces. Extensive experiments demonstrate our superior performance compared
to existing methods across diverse challenging scenarios, excelling in
geometric accuracy, detail preservation, and reconstruction completeness while
maintaining high efficiency. Code is available at

Abstract: Generating high-fidelity images of humans with fine-grained control over
attributes such as hairstyle and clothing remains a core challenge in
personalized text-to-image synthesis. While prior methods emphasize identity
preservation from a reference image, they lack modularity and fail to provide
disentangled control over specific visual attributes. We introduce a new
paradigm for attribute-specific image prompting, in which distinct sets of
reference images are used to guide the generation of individual aspects of
human appearance, such as hair, clothing, and identity. Our method encodes
these inputs into attribute-specific tokens, which are injected into a
pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model. This enables compositional and
disentangled control over multiple visual factors, even across multiple people
within a single image. To promote natural composition and robust
disentanglement, we curate a cross-reference training dataset featuring
subjects in diverse poses and expressions, and propose a multi-attribute
cross-reference training strategy that encourages the model to generate
faithful outputs from misaligned attribute inputs while adhering to both
identity and textual conditioning. Extensive experiments show that our method
achieves state-of-the-art performance in accurately following both visual and
textual prompts. Our framework paves the way for more configurable human image
synthesis by combining visual prompting with text-driven generation. Webpage is

Motivation: 虽然多模态扩散变换器通过联合自注意力实现了丰富的跨模态对齐，但对其注意力机制如何具体贡献于图像生成的理解仍然有限，需要系统分析其语义信息传播机制。

Method: 引入Seg4Diff框架系统分析MM-DiT的注意力结构，识别语义接地专家层，并应用基于掩码标注图像的轻量微调方案来增强语义分组能力。

Result: 发现MM-DiT中存在特定块能够一致地将文本标记与空间连贯的图像区域对齐，自然产生高质量语义分割掩码，微调后显著提升分割性能和生成图像保真度。

Conclusion: 语义分组是扩散变换器的涌现特性，可以被选择性放大来同时推进分割和生成性能，为实现视觉感知与生成的统一模型铺平道路。

Abstract: Text-to-image diffusion models excel at translating language prompts into
photorealistic images by implicitly grounding textual concepts through their
cross-modal attention mechanisms. Recent multi-modal diffusion transformers
extend this by introducing joint self-attention over concatenated image and
text tokens, enabling richer and more scalable cross-modal alignment. However,
a detailed understanding of how and where these attention maps contribute to
image generation remains limited. In this paper, we introduce Seg4Diff
(Segmentation for Diffusion), a systematic framework for analyzing the
attention structures of MM-DiT, with a focus on how specific layers propagate
semantic information from text to image. Through comprehensive analysis, we
identify a semantic grounding expert layer, a specific MM-DiT block that
consistently aligns text tokens with spatially coherent image regions,
naturally producing high-quality semantic segmentation masks. We further
demonstrate that applying a lightweight fine-tuning scheme with mask-annotated
image data enhances the semantic grouping capabilities of these layers and
thereby improves both segmentation performance and generated image fidelity.
Our findings demonstrate that semantic grouping is an emergent property of
diffusion transformers and can be selectively amplified to advance both
segmentation and generation performance, paving the way for unified models that
bridge visual perception and generation.

Motivation: 现有动态表面重建方法需要多个正则化项或大量训练数据，导致重建精度妥协、过度平滑以及对未见物体和运动的泛化能力差。

Method: 使用多分辨率体素网格捕捉不同空间尺度的整体运动，结合基于网格的Sobolev预处理进行梯度优化，应用Chamfer损失和弱等距损失确保变形精度和时间一致性。

Result: 广泛评估表明该方法在长序列重建中优于现有最先进技术，特别是对未见物体和运动具有更好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: Preconditioned Deformation Grids技术通过创新的网格预处理和损失函数设计，有效解决了动态表面重建中的精度和泛化问题，为点云序列的变形估计提供了新思路。

Abstract: Dynamic surface reconstruction of objects from point cloud sequences is a
challenging field in computer graphics. Existing approaches either require
multiple regularization terms or extensive training data which, however, lead
to compromises in reconstruction accuracy as well as over-smoothing or poor
generalization to unseen objects and motions. To address these lim- itations,
we introduce Preconditioned Deformation Grids, a novel technique for estimating
coherent deformation fields directly from unstructured point cloud sequences
without requiring or forming explicit correspondences. Key to our approach is
the use of multi-resolution voxel grids that capture the overall motion at
varying spatial scales, enabling a more flexible deformation representation. In
conjunction with incorporating grid-based Sobolev preconditioning into
gradient-based optimization, we show that applying a Chamfer loss between the
input point clouds as well as to an evolving template mesh is sufficient to
obtain accurate deformations. To ensure temporal consistency along the object
surface, we include a weak isometry loss on mesh edges which complements the
main objective without constraining deformation fidelity. Extensive evaluations
demonstrate that our method achieves superior results, particularly for long
sequences, compared to state-of-the-art techniques.

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于金融问答的检索增强生成框架，结合智能AI代理和Multi-HyDE系统，通过生成多个非等价查询来提高金融文档检索效果，在标准基准上准确率提升11.2%，幻觉减少15%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 金融问答需要准确可靠的知识检索，传统单一数据库和检索器难以处理复杂的金融监管文件、市场分析和多年报告，需要更复杂的方法来应对持续更新的数据源和高风险场景。

Method: 开发了一个金融RAG框架，利用智能AI代理和Multi-HyDE系统生成多个非等价查询，优化了令牌效率和多步骤金融推理流程，结合关键词和基于表格的检索机制。

Result: 在标准金融QA基准测试中，该方法将准确率提高了11.2%，幻觉减少了15%，显著提升了答案的准确性和可靠性。

Abstract: Accurate and reliable knowledge retrieval is vital for financial
question-answering, where continually updated data sources and complex,
high-stakes contexts demand precision. Traditional retrieval systems rely on a
single database and retriever, but financial applications require more
sophisticated approaches to handle intricate regulatory filings, market
analyses, and extensive multi-year reports. We introduce a framework for
financial Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) that leverages agentic AI and
the Multi-HyDE system, an approach that generates multiple, nonequivalent
queries to boost the effectiveness and coverage of retrieval from large,
structured financial corpora. Our pipeline is optimized for token efficiency
and multi-step financial reasoning, and we demonstrate that their combination
improves accuracy by 11.2% and reduces hallucinations by 15%. Our method is
evaluated on standard financial QA benchmarks, showing that integrating
domain-specific retrieval mechanisms such as Multi-HyDE with robust toolsets,
including keyword and table-based retrieval, significantly enhances both the
accuracy and reliability of answers. This research not only delivers a modular,
adaptable retrieval framework for finance but also highlights the importance of
structured agent workflows and multi-perspective retrieval for trustworthy
deployment of AI in high-stakes financial applications.

Motivation: 双编码器模型在信息检索中广泛应用，但其欧几里得几何嵌入空间限制了表达能力，特别是在层次检索场景下，匹配文档是查询的所有祖先节点时，存在长距离检索性能下降的问题。

Method: 首先证明了双编码器在层次检索中的可行性条件，然后提出预训练-微调方法：先在大规模数据上预训练，再在层次检索任务上微调，以解决长距离检索性能下降问题。

Result: 在WordNet层次结构上的实验表明，预训练-微调方法将长距离检索对的召回率从19%提升到76%，同时在购物查询数据集上也改善了相关产品的检索效果。

Conclusion: 预训练-微调方法有效解决了双编码器在层次检索中的长距离检索性能下降问题，显著提升了检索质量，为层次检索任务提供了实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Dual encoder (DE) models, where a pair of matching query and document are
embedded into similar vector representations, are widely used in information
retrieval due to their simplicity and scalability. However, the Euclidean
geometry of the embedding space limits the expressive power of DEs, which may
compromise their quality. This paper investigates such limitations in the
context of hierarchical retrieval (HR), where the document set has a
hierarchical structure and the matching documents for a query are all of its
ancestors. We first prove that DEs are feasible for HR as long as the embedding
dimension is linear in the depth of the hierarchy and logarithmic in the number
of documents. Then we study the problem of learning such embeddings in a
standard retrieval setup where DEs are trained on samples of matching query and
document pairs. Our experiments reveal a lost-in-the-long-distance phenomenon,
where retrieval accuracy degrades for documents further away in the hierarchy.
To address this, we introduce a pretrain-finetune recipe that significantly
improves long-distance retrieval without sacrificing performance on closer
documents. We experiment on a realistic hierarchy from WordNet for retrieving
documents at various levels of abstraction, and show that pretrain-finetune
boosts the recall on long-distance pairs from 19% to 76%. Finally, we
demonstrate that our method improves retrieval of relevant products on a
shopping queries dataset.

Abstract: Compact dual-encoder models are widely used for retrieval owing to their
efficiency and scalability. However, such models often underperform compared to
their Large Language Model (LLM)-based retrieval counterparts, likely due to
their limited world knowledge. While LLM-based data augmentation has been
proposed as a strategy to bridge this performance gap, there is insufficient
understanding of its effectiveness and scalability to real-world retrieval
problems. Existing research does not systematically explore key factors such as
the optimal augmentation scale, the necessity of using large augmentation
models, and whether diverse augmentations improve generalization, particularly
in out-of-distribution (OOD) settings. This work presents a comprehensive study
of the effectiveness of LLM augmentation for retrieval, comprising over 100
distinct experimental settings of retrieval models, augmentation models and
augmentation strategies. We find that, while augmentation enhances retrieval
performance, its benefits diminish beyond a certain augmentation scale, even
with diverse augmentation strategies. Surprisingly, we observe that
augmentation with smaller LLMs can achieve performance competitive with larger
augmentation models. Moreover, we examine how augmentation effectiveness varies
with retrieval model pre-training, revealing that augmentation provides the
most benefit to models which are not well pre-trained. Our insights pave the
way for more judicious and efficient augmentation strategies, thus enabling
informed decisions and maximizing retrieval performance while being more
cost-effective. Code and augmented datasets accompanying this work are publicly

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语义ID方法存在语义冲突问题，相似文档被分配相同ID，通常通过添加非语义标记来区分，但这会引入随机性并扩大搜索空间，影响性能。

Method: 提出纯语义索引方法，放宽严格最近质心选择，引入两种模型无关算法：穷举候选匹配(ECM)和递归残差搜索(RRS)，确保ID唯一性。

Result: 在顺序推荐、产品搜索和文档检索任务上的大量实验表明，该方法提升了整体性能和冷启动性能。

Conclusion: 确保ID唯一性的方法有效，纯语义索引能够改善推荐和检索系统的性能。

Abstract: Semantic identifiers (IDs) have proven effective in adapting large language
models for generative recommendation and retrieval. However, existing methods
often suffer from semantic ID conflicts, where semantically similar documents
(or items) are assigned identical IDs. A common strategy to avoid conflicts is
to append a non-semantic token to distinguish them, which introduces randomness
and expands the search space, therefore hurting performance. In this paper, we
propose purely semantic indexing to generate unique, semantic-preserving IDs
without appending non-semantic tokens. We enable unique ID assignment by
relaxing the strict nearest-centroid selection and introduce two model-agnostic
algorithms: exhaustive candidate matching (ECM) and recursive residual
searching (RRS). Extensive experiments on sequential recommendation, product
search, and document retrieval tasks demonstrate that our methods improve both
overall and cold-start performance, highlighting the effectiveness of ensuring
ID uniqueness.

Motivation: 随着新闻、法律、医疗和科学领域文本数据的快速增长，用户难以高效理解和提取大量内容中的有意义信息。长文档抽象摘要资源密集且相关研究较少，现有BART模型受限于上下文窗口长度。

Method: 提出PTS模型将源文档分页，每页与目标摘要的相关部分对齐生成部分摘要。进一步提出PTSPI模型，在合并部分摘要前增加动态页面权重层，重点关注信息量最大的页面。

Result: 在基准数据集上的实验表明，PTSPI模型相比最先进方法在ROUGE-1分数上提升了6.32%，在ROUGE-2分数上提升了8.08%。

Conclusion: PTS和PTSPI模型有效解决了长文档抽象摘要的挑战，通过分页对齐和动态权重机制显著提升了摘要质量，为长文档处理提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: The rapid growth of textual data across news, legal, medical, and scientific
domains is becoming a challenge for efficiently accessing and understanding
large volumes of content. It is increasingly complex for users to consume and
extract meaningful information efficiently. Thus, raising the need for
summarization. Unlike short document summarization, long document abstractive
summarization is resource-intensive, and very little literature is present in
this direction. BART is a widely used efficient sequence-to-sequence
(seq-to-seq) model. However, when it comes to summarizing long documents, the
length of the context window limits its capabilities. We proposed a model
called PTS (Page-specific Target-text alignment Summarization) that extends the
seq-to-seq method for abstractive summarization by dividing the source document
into several pages. PTS aligns each page with the relevant part of the target
summary for better supervision. Partial summaries are generated for each page
of the document. We proposed another model called PTSPI (Page-specific
Target-text alignment Summarization with Page Importance), an extension to PTS
where an additional layer is placed before merging the partial summaries into
the final summary. This layer provides dynamic page weightage and explicit
supervision to focus on the most informative pages. We performed experiments on
the benchmark dataset and found that PTSPI outperformed the SOTA by 6.32\% in
ROUGE-1 and 8.08\% in ROUGE-2 scores.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究SPLADE模型中词汇表的作用及其与检索效率和效果的关系，目前缺乏对词汇表在SPLADE模型中作用的研究。

Method: 构建两个100K大小词汇表的BERT模型（一个使用ESPLADE预训练方法初始化，一个随机初始化），在真实搜索点击日志上微调，应用基于logit分数的查询和文档剪枝来平衡效率。

Result: 当应用剪枝时，两个模型在计算预算下比32K大小的普通SPLADE模型更有效，且ESPLADE模型比随机词汇表模型更有效，同时保持相似的检索成本。

Conclusion: 词汇表大小和预训练权重在检索引擎中配置查询、文档及其交互的表征规范，超越了它们在NLP中的原始意义和目的，为LSR的改进提供了新的方向。

Abstract: Learned Sparse Retrieval (LSR) such as SPLADE has growing interest for
effective semantic 1st stage matching while enjoying the efficiency of inverted
indices. A recent work on learning SPLADE models with expanded vocabularies
(ESPLADE) was proposed to represent queries and documents into a sparse space
of custom vocabulary which have different levels of vocabularic granularity.
Within this effort, however, there have not been many studies on the role of
vocabulary in SPLADE models and their relationship to retrieval efficiency and
effectiveness.
  To study this, we construct BERT models with 100K-sized output vocabularies,
one initialized with the ESPLADE pretraining method and one initialized
randomly. After finetune on real-world search click logs, we applied logit
score-based queries and documents pruning to max size for further balancing
efficiency. The experimental result in our evaluation set shows that, when
pruning is applied, the two models are effective compared to the 32K-sized
normal SPLADE model in the computational budget under the BM25. And the ESPLADE
models are more effective than the random vocab model, while having a similar
retrieval cost.
  The result indicates that the size and pretrained weight of output
vocabularies play the role of configuring the representational specification
for queries, documents, and their interactions in the retrieval engine, beyond
their original meaning and purposes in NLP. These findings can provide a new
room for improvement for LSR by identifying the importance of representational
specification from vocabulary configuration for efficient and effective
retrieval.

Conclusion: 研究强调了页面级检索系统在教育环境中的潜力和挑战，需要更精细的检索方法来构建可靠的AI辅导解决方案，特别是在提供参考页码方面。

Abstract: Technology-enhanced learning environments often help students retrieve
relevant learning content for questions arising during self-paced study. Large
language models (LLMs) have emerged as novel aids for information retrieval
during learning. While LLMs are effective for general-purpose
question-answering, they typically lack alignment with the domain knowledge of
specific course materials such as textbooks and slides. We investigate
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and GraphRAG, a knowledge graph-enhanced
RAG approach, for page-level question answering in an undergraduate mathematics
textbook. While RAG has been effective for retrieving discrete, contextually
relevant passages, GraphRAG may excel in modeling interconnected concepts and
hierarchical knowledge structures. We curate a dataset of 477 question-answer
pairs, each tied to a distinct textbook page. We then compare the standard
embedding-based RAG methods to GraphRAG for evaluating both retrieval
accuracy-whether the correct page is retrieved-and generated answer quality via
F1 scores. Our findings show that embedding-based RAG achieves higher retrieval
accuracy and better F1 scores compared to GraphRAG, which tends to retrieve
excessive and sometimes irrelevant content due to its entity-based structure.
We also explored re-ranking the retrieved pages with LLM and observed mixed
results, including performance drop and hallucinations when dealing with larger
context windows. Overall, this study highlights both the promises and
challenges of page-level retrieval systems in educational contexts, emphasizing
the need for more refined retrieval methods to build reliable AI tutoring
solutions in providing reference page numbers.

Conclusion: DyTA4Rec通过引入动态时序建模机制，有效解决了LLM代理在推荐系统中模拟真实用户行为的挑战，为推荐系统研究提供了更准确的模拟工具

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate human-like capabilities in language
understanding, reasoning, and generation, driving interest in using LLM-based
agents to simulate human feedback in recommender systems. However, most
existing approaches rely on static user profiling, neglecting the temporal and
dynamic nature of user interests. This limitation stems from a disconnect
between language modelling and behaviour modelling, which constrains the
capacity of agents to represent sequential patterns. To address this challenge,
we propose a Dynamic Temporal-aware Agent-based simulator for Recommender
Systems, DyTA4Rec, which enables agents to model and utilise evolving user
behaviour based on historical interactions. DyTA4Rec features a dynamic updater
for real-time profile refinement, temporal-enhanced prompting for sequential
context, and self-adaptive aggregation for coherent feedback. Experimental
results at group and individual levels show that DyTA4Rec significantly
improves the alignment between simulated and actual user behaviour by modelling
dynamic characteristics and enhancing temporal awareness in LLM-based agents.

Abstract: The pre-ranking stage in industrial recommendation systems faces a
fundamental conflict between efficiency and effectiveness. While powerful
models like Target Attention (TA) excel at capturing complex feature
interactions in the ranking stage, their high computational cost makes them
infeasible for pre-ranking, which often relies on simplistic vector-product
models. This disparity creates a significant performance bottleneck for the
entire system. To bridge this gap, we propose TARQ, a novel pre-ranking
framework. Inspired by generative models, TARQ's key innovation is to equip
pre-ranking with an architecture approximate to TA by Residual Quantization.
This allows us to bring the modeling power of TA into the latency-critical
pre-ranking stage for the first time, establishing a new state-of-the-art
trade-off between accuracy and efficiency. Extensive offline experiments and
large-scale online A/B tests at Taobao demonstrate TARQ's significant
improvements in ranking performance. Consequently, our model has been fully
deployed in production, serving tens of millions of daily active users and
yielding substantial business improvements.

Motivation: 推荐系统存在流行度偏见，过度推荐热门物品而忽视相关的小众物品。作者希望通过理解基准推荐数据集中用户与小众物品的互动来缓解这一问题。

Method: 将用户按活跃度（高活跃vs低活跃）和物品偏好（主流vs小众）两个维度划分，提出一个BPR损失重加权框架，引入两个可解释参数分别控制用户活跃度和物品流行度的重要性。

Result: 实验表明，提升高活跃-小众用户的权重可以减少流行度偏见，并能提高整体推荐性能。与单独考虑用户活跃度或物品流行度的方法相比，同时考虑两者交互可以获得帕累托优势性能。

Conclusion: 考虑用户活跃度与物品流行度的交互作用比单独考虑任一因素能更有效地缓解推荐系统的流行度偏见问题，实现更好的推荐性能。

Abstract: Recommender systems have been shown to exhibit popularity bias by
over-recommending popular items and under-recommending relevant niche items. We
seek to understand interactions with niche items in benchmark recommendation
datasets as a step toward mitigating popularity bias. We find that, compared to
mainstream users, niche-preferring users exhibit a longer-tailed activity-level
distribution, indicating the existence of users who both prefer niche items and
exhibit high activity levels. We partition users along two axes: (1) activity
level ("power" vs. "light") and (2) item-popularity preference ("mainstream"
vs. "niche"), and show that in several benchmark datasets, the number of
power-niche users (high activity and niche preference) is statistically
significantly larger than expected under a null configuration model. Motivated
by this observation, we propose a framework for reweighting the Bayesian
Personalized Ranking (BPR) loss that simultaneously reweights based on user
activity level and item popularity. Our method introduces two interpretable
parameters: one controlling the significance of user activity level, and the
other of item popularity. Experiments on benchmark datasets show that
upweighting power-niche users reduces popularity bias and can increase overall
performance. In contrast to previous work that only considers user activity
level or item popularity in isolation, our results suggest that considering
their interaction leads to Pareto-dominant performance.

*Tianyuan Li,Lei Wang,Ahtamjan Ahmat,Yating Yang,Bo Ma,Rui Dong,Bangju Han*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于多模态大语言模型的生成式跨模态检索框架，通过生成结构化语义标识符和引入理由引导监督策略来解决现有方法在语义对齐和可扩展性方面的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的生成式跨模态检索方法依赖人工设计的字符串ID、基于聚类的标签或需要词汇表扩展的原子标识符，这些方法在语义对齐和可扩展性方面存在局限性。

Method: 提出词汇高效的标识符生成框架，让MLLM从图像-标题对生成结构化语义标识符（包含对象、动作等概念级标记），并引入理由引导监督策略，让模型在生成标识符时同时产生一句话解释作为辅助监督信号。

Result: 该方法能够自然地对齐模型的生成空间而无需修改分词器，提高了语义基础并减少了训练过程中的幻觉现象。

Conclusion: 所提出的框架为生成式跨模态检索提供了一种更有效和可扩展的解决方案，通过结构化语义标识符和辅助监督信号改善了检索性能。

Abstract: Generative cross-modal retrieval, which treats retrieval as a generation
task, has emerged as a promising direction with the rise of Multimodal Large
Language Models (MLLMs). In this setting, the model responds to a text query by
generating an identifier corresponding to the target image. However, existing
methods typically rely on manually crafted string IDs, clustering-based labels,
or atomic identifiers requiring vocabulary expansion, all of which face
challenges in semantic alignment or scalability.To address these limitations,
we propose a vocabulary-efficient identifier generation framework that prompts
MLLMs to generate Structured Semantic Identifiers from image-caption pairs.
These identifiers are composed of concept-level tokens such as objects and
actions, naturally aligning with the model's generation space without modifying
the tokenizer. Additionally, we introduce a Rationale-Guided Supervision
Strategy, prompting the model to produce a one-sentence explanation alongside
each identifier serves as an auxiliary supervision signal that improves
semantic grounding and reduces hallucinations during training.

*Ruihan Luo,Xuanjing Chen,Ziyang Ding*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: SeqUDA-Rec是一个新颖的深度学习框架，通过整合用户行为序列和全局无监督数据增强来解决传统推荐系统的局限性，显著提升了推荐准确性和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统推荐系统存在两个主要问题：依赖有限的显式用户反馈监督信号，以及对噪声或无意交互的脆弱性。需要一种能够更好捕捉用户偏好并提高鲁棒性的方法。

Method: 1) 构建全局用户-物品交互图(GUIG)捕捉局部和全局物品关联；2) 应用图对比学习生成鲁棒嵌入；3) 使用基于Transformer的序列编码器建模用户偏好演化；4) 采用GAN增强策略生成可信交互模式补充训练数据。

Result: 在两个真实营销数据集(Amazon Ads和TikTok Ad Clicks)上的实验表明，SeqUDA-Rec显著优于SASRec、BERT4Rec和GCL4SR等最先进基线，NDCG@10提升6.7%，HR@10提升11.3%。

Conclusion: SeqUDA-Rec在个性化广告和智能内容推荐方面表现出色，证明了其方法的有效性，为解决推荐系统中的监督信号稀疏性和噪声鲁棒性问题提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: Personalized content marketing has become a crucial strategy for digital
platforms, aiming to deliver tailored advertisements and recommendations that
match user preferences. Traditional recommendation systems often suffer from
two limitations: (1) reliance on limited supervised signals derived from
explicit user feedback, and (2) vulnerability to noisy or unintentional
interactions. To address these challenges, we propose SeqUDA-Rec, a novel deep
learning framework that integrates user behavior sequences with global
unsupervised data augmentation to enhance recommendation accuracy and
robustness. Our approach first constructs a Global User-Item Interaction Graph
(GUIG) from all user behavior sequences, capturing both local and global item
associations. Then, a graph contrastive learning module is applied to generate
robust embeddings, while a sequential Transformer-based encoder models users'
evolving preferences. To further enhance diversity and counteract sparse
supervised labels, we employ a GAN-based augmentation strategy, generating
plausible interaction patterns and supplementing training data. Extensive
experiments on two real-world marketing datasets (Amazon Ads and TikTok Ad
Clicks) demonstrate that SeqUDA-Rec significantly outperforms state-of-the-art
baselines such as SASRec, BERT4Rec, and GCL4SR. Our model achieves a 6.7%
improvement in NDCG@10 and 11.3% improvement in HR@10, proving its
effectiveness in personalized advertising and intelligent content
recommendation.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种针对纵向检索实验的ir_datasets自定义扩展，通过声明式而非命令式的方法描述实验的时间维度，从而降低代码复杂度并提高实验的可复现性和可扩展性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的Cranfield风格检索评估只包含静态的查询和文档集，缺乏时间维度。纵向评估需要自定义逻辑，这会增加研究软件的复杂性，降低实验的可复现性和可扩展性。

Method: 基于对LongEval 2024的提交，开发了ir_datasets的自定义扩展，允许声明式地描述纵向检索实验的重要方面，如不同时间点可用的查询、文档和相关性反馈。

Result: 重新实现了LongEval 2024的提交，发现声明式访问可以显著降低代码复杂度。

Conclusion: 提出的ir_datasets扩展为纵向检索实验提供了一种有效的声明式方法，能够简化实验实现并提高研究质量。

Abstract: The longitudinal evaluation of retrieval systems aims to capture how
information needs and documents evolve over time. However, classical
Cranfield-style retrieval evaluations only consist of a static set of queries
and documents and thereby miss time as an evaluation dimension. Therefore,
longitudinal evaluations need to complement retrieval toolkits with custom
logic. This custom logic increases the complexity of research software, which
might reduce the reproducibility and extensibility of experiments. Based on our
submissions to the 2024 edition of LongEval, we propose a custom extension of
ir_datasets for longitudinal retrieval experiments. This extension allows for
declaratively, instead of imperatively, describing important aspects of
longitudinal retrieval experiments, e.g., which queries, documents, and/or
relevance feedback are available at which point in time. We reimplement our
submissions to LongEval 2024 against our new ir_datasets extension, and find
that the declarative access can reduce the complexity of the code.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 该论文通过分析WildChat数据集发现，在真实世界对话中，信息检索往往以系统做出的值得验证的事实断言形式隐式发生，即使对话的主要意图是非信息性的。作者发布了WildClaims数据集来系统研究这一现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索真实世界对话中信息检索的本质和必要性，因为现有研究主要关注传统的显式信息访问对话，而忽略了隐式信息访问现象。

Method: 对WildChat数据集进行观察性研究，构建并发布了WildClaims数据集（包含121,905个从3,000个对话中提取的事实断言），并对这些断言进行值得验证性标注。

Result: 保守估计18%-51%的对话包含值得验证的断言，非保守估计可达76%，表明隐式信息访问在真实对话中非常普遍。

Conclusion: 需要超越传统的显式信息访问理解，关注真实用户-系统对话中出现的隐式信息访问问题。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has transformed
conversational systems into practical tools used by millions. However, the
nature and necessity of information retrieval in real-world conversations
remain largely unexplored, as research has focused predominantly on
traditional, explicit information access conversations. The central question
is: What do real-world information access conversations look like? To this end,
we first conduct an observational study on the WildChat dataset, large-scale
user-ChatGPT conversations, finding that users' access to information occurs
implicitly as check-worthy factual assertions made by the system, even when the
conversation's primary intent is non-informational, such as creative writing.
To enable the systematic study of this phenomenon, we release the WildClaims
dataset, a novel resource consisting of 121,905 extracted factual claims from
7,587 utterances in 3,000 WildChat conversations, each annotated for
check-worthiness. Our preliminary analysis of this resource reveals that
conservatively 18% to 51% of conversations contain check-worthy assertions,
depending on the methods employed, and less conservatively, as many as 76% may
contain such assertions. This high prevalence underscores the importance of
moving beyond the traditional understanding of explicit information access, to
address the implicit information access that arises in real-world user-system
conversations.

Motivation: 任务导向对话系统需要大量高质量对话数据，但获取成本高昂。虽然LLM有潜力生成合成对话，但LLM模拟用户能否有效替代真实人类对话尚不明确。

Method: 提出包含对话策略、交互风格和对话评估三个关键方面的综合分析框架，在四个代表性场景下收集并比较人类用户和LLM代理用户的平行对话数据集。

Result: 分析显示两类用户在问题解决方法、问题广度、用户参与度、上下文依赖性、反馈极性、语言风格和幻觉意识等方面存在显著行为差异，但在深度优先/广度优先维度和有用性维度上表现一致。

Conclusion: 研究结果为推进基于LLM的用户模拟提供了关键见解，构建了可泛化的用户行为模式分析框架，为未来如何在对话系统中使用用户模拟提供了新视角。

Abstract: Task-oriented conversational systems are essential for efficiently addressing
diverse user needs, yet their development requires substantial amounts of
high-quality conversational data that is challenging and costly to obtain.
While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated potential in generating
synthetic conversations, the extent to which these agent-generated interactions
can effectively substitute real human conversations remains unclear. This work
presents the first systematic comparison between LLM-simulated users and human
users in personalized task-oriented conversations. We propose a comprehensive
analytical framework encompassing three key aspects (conversation strategy,
interaction style, and conversation evaluation) and ten distinct dimensions for
evaluating user behaviors, and collect parallel conversational datasets from
both human users and LLM agent users across four representative scenarios under
identical conditions. Our analysis reveals significant behavioral differences
between the two user types in problem-solving approaches, question broadness,
user engagement, context dependency, feedback polarity and promise, language
style, and hallucination awareness. We found consistency in the agent users and
human users across the depth-first or breadth-first dimensions, as well as the
usefulness dimensions. These findings provide critical insights for advancing
LLM-based user simulation. Our multi-dimensional taxonomy constructed a
generalizable framework for analyzing user behavior patterns, offering insights
from LLM agent users and human users. By this work, we provide perspectives on
rethinking how to use user simulation in conversational systems in the future.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于相关性的生成式检索方法缺乏个性化，导致检索结果与用户多样化期望不匹配，特别是在表情包检索场景中这一问题尤为突出。

Method: 设计用户表示学习模型，通过三个预测任务利用个人信息和点击历史学习判别性用户表示；提出意图感知学习目标，优先生成与高排名意图相关的表情包。

Result: 离线和在线测试结果表明，PEARL在个性化表情包检索任务上显著优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: PEARL框架成功解决了生成式检索中的个性化问题，为表情包检索提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Formulating information retrieval as a variant of generative modeling,
specifically using autoregressive models to generate relevant identifiers for a
given query, has recently attracted considerable attention. However, its
application to personalized sticker retrieval remains largely unexplored and
presents unique challenges: existing relevance-based generative retrieval
methods typically lack personalization, leading to a mismatch between diverse
user expectations and the retrieved results. To address this gap, we propose
PEARL, a novel generative framework for personalized sticker retrieval, and
make two key contributions: (i) To encode user-specific sticker preferences, we
design a representation learning model to learn discriminative user
representations. It is trained on three prediction tasks that leverage personal
information and click history; and (ii) To generate stickers aligned with a
user's query intent, we propose a novel intent-aware learning objective that
prioritizes stickers associated with higher-ranked intents. Empirical results
from both offline evaluations and online tests demonstrate that PEARL
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的恶意攻击方法在仅包含评分矩阵的训练数据下可以生成有效且隐蔽的虚假用户配置文件，但当推荐系统使用侧特征时，这些方法缺乏全面的解决方案。

Method: 通过增强Leg-UP框架的生成器架构，使其能够整合侧特征，从而生成能够感知侧特征的虚假用户配置文件。

Result: 在基准测试上的实验表明，该方法在保持隐蔽性的同时实现了强大的攻击性能。

Conclusion: 该方法成功解决了推荐系统中存在侧特征时的恶意攻击问题，为相关安全研究提供了新的思路。

Abstract: Recommender systems (RS) greatly influence users' consumption decisions,
making them attractive targets for malicious shilling attacks that inject fake
user profiles to manipulate recommendations. Existing shilling methods can
generate effective and stealthy fake profiles when training data only contain
rating matrix, but they lack comprehensive solutions for scenarios where side
features are present and utilized by the recommender. To address this gap, we
extend the Leg-UP framework by enhancing the generator architecture to
incorporate side features, enabling the generation of side-feature-aware fake
user profiles. Experiments on benchmarks show that our method achieves strong
attack performance while maintaining stealthiness.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于知识图谱检索增强生成（KG-RAG）的新方法，用于解决设施布局问题（FLP）的算法选择难题，该方法通过多维度检索机制从领域知识图谱中获取证据，利用LLM生成算法推荐，并在真实测试案例中显著优于商业LLM聊天机器人。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 设施布局问题（FLP）是一个NP难的多目标优化问题，算法选择需要深厚的专家知识，且算法性能高度依赖于具体问题特征（规模、目标、约束等），因此需要数据驱动的推荐方法来指导自动化设计系统中的算法选择。

Method: 构建领域特定的知识图谱（从已发表文献中提取），采用多维度检索机制（精确的图搜索、灵活的向量搜索、高层聚类搜索）从知识图谱中收集相关证据，然后利用大型语言模型（LLM）基于检索到的证据生成算法推荐并进行数据驱动的推理。

Result: 在多个不同的真实世界FLP测试案例中，将提出的KG-RAG方法与可访问知识库表格的商业LLM聊天机器人进行比较，基于推荐准确性和推理能力，KG-RAG方法表现显著优于商业LLM聊天机器人。

Conclusion: KG-RAG框架能够有效解决FLP算法选择的复杂问题，通过结合知识图谱和LLM的优势，提供了数据驱动的算法推荐方法，在真实场景中表现出优越的性能。

Abstract: Selecting a solution algorithm for the Facility Layout Problem (FLP), an
NP-hard optimization problem with a multiobjective trade-off, is a complex task
that requires deep expert knowledge. The performance of a given algorithm
depends on specific problem characteristics such as its scale, objectives, and
constraints. This creates a need for a data-driven recommendation method to
guide algorithm selection in automated design systems. This paper introduces a
new recommendation method to make such expertise accessible, based on a
Knowledge Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (KG RAG) framework. To
address this, a domain-specific knowledge graph is constructed from published
literature. The method then employs a multi-faceted retrieval mechanism to
gather relevant evidence from this knowledge graph using three distinct
approaches, which include a precise graph-based search, flexible vector-based
search, and high-level cluster-based search. The retrieved evidence is utilized
by a Large Language Model (LLM) to generate algorithm recommendations with
data-driven reasoning. The proposed KG-RAG method is compared against a
commercial LLM chatbot with access to the knowledge base as a table, across a
series of diverse, real-world FLP test cases. Based on recommendation accuracy
and reasoning capability, the proposed method performed significantly better
than the commercial LLM chatbot.

TL;DR: OnePiece是一个统一的框架，将LLM风格的上下文工程和推理机制集成到工业级检索和排序模型中，在Shopee的个性化搜索场景中实现了显著的商业指标提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工业推荐系统主要局限于移植Transformer架构，而LLM的成功不仅来自架构，还来自上下文工程和多步推理机制，这些在工业排序系统中尚未充分探索。

Method: 基于纯Transformer架构，提出三个关键创新：结构化上下文工程（增强交互历史信号）、块级潜在推理（多步表示精炼）、渐进式多任务训练（利用用户反馈链监督推理步骤）。

Result: 在Shopee主个性化搜索场景部署后，实现了GMV/UU超过2%的提升和广告收入2.90%的增长。

Conclusion: OnePiece框架成功证明了将LLM风格的上下文工程和推理机制集成到工业推荐系统中的有效性，为推荐系统带来了实质性改进。

Abstract: Despite the growing interest in replicating the scaled success of large
language models (LLMs) in industrial search and recommender systems, most
existing industrial efforts remain limited to transplanting Transformer
architectures, which bring only incremental improvements over strong Deep
Learning Recommendation Models (DLRMs). From a first principle perspective, the
breakthroughs of LLMs stem not only from their architectures but also from two
complementary mechanisms: context engineering, which enriches raw input queries
with contextual cues to better elicit model capabilities, and multi-step
reasoning, which iteratively refines model outputs through intermediate
reasoning paths. However, these two mechanisms and their potential to unlock
substantial improvements remain largely underexplored in industrial ranking
systems.
  In this paper, we propose OnePiece, a unified framework that seamlessly
integrates LLM-style context engineering and reasoning into both retrieval and
ranking models of industrial cascaded pipelines. OnePiece is built on a pure
Transformer backbone and further introduces three key innovations: (1)
structured context engineering, which augments interaction history with
preference and scenario signals and unifies them into a structured tokenized
input sequence for both retrieval and ranking; (2) block-wise latent reasoning,
which equips the model with multi-step refinement of representations and scales
reasoning bandwidth via block size; (3) progressive multi-task training, which
leverages user feedback chains to effectively supervise reasoning steps during
training. OnePiece has been deployed in the main personalized search scenario
of Shopee and achieves consistent online gains across different key business
metrics, including over $+2\%$ GMV/UU and a $+2.90\%$ increase in advertising
revenue.

TL;DR: MetaEmbed是一个新的多模态检索框架，通过固定数量的可学习元令牌生成紧凑而表达力强的多向量嵌入，实现检索质量和效率的可扩展平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态嵌入方法要么将查询和候选压缩为单个向量限制了细粒度信息表达，要么产生过多向量导致检索成本过高。

Method: 在训练时向输入序列添加固定数量的可学习元令牌，测试时使用其最后一层上下文表示作为多向量嵌入，通过Matryoshka多向量检索训练按粒度组织信息。

Result: 在MMEB和ViDoRe基准测试中达到最先进的检索性能，并能稳健扩展到320亿参数模型。

Conclusion: MetaEmbed框架实现了多模态检索的可扩展性，用户可以根据需求在检索质量和效率之间进行平衡。

Abstract: Universal multimodal embedding models have achieved great success in
capturing semantic relevance between queries and candidates. However, current
methods either condense queries and candidates into a single vector,
potentially limiting the expressiveness for fine-grained information, or
produce too many vectors that are prohibitively expensive for multi-vector
retrieval. In this work, we introduce MetaEmbed, a new framework for multimodal
retrieval that rethinks how multimodal embeddings are constructed and
interacted with at scale. During training, a fixed number of learnable Meta
Tokens are appended to the input sequence. At test-time, their last-layer
contextualized representations serve as compact yet expressive multi-vector
embeddings. Through the proposed Matryoshka Multi-Vector Retrieval training,
MetaEmbed learns to organize information by granularity across multiple
vectors. As a result, we enable test-time scaling in multimodal retrieval,
where users can balance retrieval quality against efficiency demands by
selecting the number of tokens used for indexing and retrieval interactions.
Extensive evaluations on the Massive Multimodal Embedding Benchmark (MMEB) and
the Visual Document Retrieval Benchmark (ViDoRe) confirm that MetaEmbed
achieves state-of-the-art retrieval performance while scaling robustly to
models with 32B parameters.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个统一自动化框架，用于动态评估加州州立大学北岭分校电动汽车充电对配电馈线和变压器的影响。该框架整合了Julia编程语言和PowerWorld Simulator，结合真实充电站数据进行分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着电动汽车普及率加速增长，充电需求增加给本地配电系统带来额外压力。EV负载曲线在一天中的变化特性需要进行详细的时间分析，以识别峰值负载条件、预测最坏情况并规划及时的基础设施升级。

Method: 开发了一个灵活测试平台，通过EasySimauto.jl包将Julia高性能编程语言与PowerWorld Simulator集成。该框架利用CSUN电动汽车充电站收集的真实数据集（包含一年内15分钟间隔的测量数据），结合高分辨率数据和动态仿真进行分析。

Result: 该系统为评估变压器负载、馈线利用率和整体系统压力提供了有价值的工具。结果支持基于数据的EV基础设施部署、负载预测和能源管理策略决策。

Conclusion: 该框架允许进行基于场景的研究，探索未来EV渗透率增加或充电行为变化的影响。其模块化架构也使其适用于面临类似电气化挑战的其他校园或城市配电系统。

Abstract: This paper introduces a unified and automated framework designed to
dynamically assess the impact of electric vehicle (EV) charging on distribution
feeders and transformers at California State University, Northridge (CSUN). As
EV adoption accelerates, the resulting increase in charging demand imposes
additional stress on local power distribution systems. Moreover, the evolving
nature of EV load profiles throughout the day necessitates detailed temporal
analysis to identify peak loading conditions, anticipate worst-case scenarios,
and plan timely infrastructure upgrades. Our main contribution is the
development of a flexible testbed that integrates Julia, a high-performance
programming language for technical computing, with PowerWorld Simulator via the
EasySimauto.jl package. This integration enables seamless modeling, simulation,
and analysis of EV charging load profiles and their implications for campus
grid infrastructure. The framework leverages a real-world dataset collected
from CSUN's EV charging stations, consisting of 15-minute interval measurements
over the course of one year. By coupling high-resolution data with dynamic
simulations, the proposed system offers a valuable tool for evaluating
transformer loading, feeder utilization, and overall system stress. The results
support data-driven decision-making for EV infrastructure deployment, load
forecasting, and energy management strategies. In addition, the framework
allows for scenario-based studies to explore the impact of future increases in
EV penetration or changes in charging behavior. Its modular architecture also
makes it adaptable to other campus or urban distribution systems facing similar
electrification challenges.

Abstract: Preventing student dropout is a major challenge in higher education and it is
difficult to predict prior to enrolment which students are likely to drop out

of dropout, but much variance in dropout remains to be explained. This study
focused on predicting university dropout by using text mining techniques with
the aim of exhuming information contained in motivation statements written by
students. By combining text data with classic predictors of dropout in the form
of student characteristics, we attempt to enhance the available set of
predictive student characteristics. Our dataset consisted of 7,060 motivation
statements of students enrolling in a non-selective bachelor at a Dutch
university in 2014 and 2015. Support Vector Machines were trained on 75 percent
of the data and several models were estimated on the test data. We used various
combinations of student characteristics and text, such as TFiDF, topic
modelling, LIWC dictionary. Results showed that, although the combination of
text and student characteristics did not improve the prediction of dropout,
text analysis alone predicted dropout similarly well as a set of student
characteristics. Suggestions for future research are provided.

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) promises new opportunities across many domains,
including agriculture. However, the adoption of AI systems in this sector faces
several challenges. System complexity can impede trust, as farmers' livelihoods
depend on their decision-making and they may reject opaque or
hard-to-understand recommendations. Data privacy concerns also pose a barrier,
especially when farmers lack transparency regarding who can access their data
and for what purposes.
  This paper examines dairy farmers' explainability requirements for technical
recommendations and data privacy, along with the influence of socio-demographic
factors. Based on a mixed-methods study involving 40 German dairy farmers, we
identify five user personas through k-means clustering. Our findings reveal
varying requirements, with some farmers preferring little detail while others
seek full transparency across different aspects. Age, technology experience,
and confidence in using digital systems were found to correlate with these
explainability requirements. The resulting user personas offer practical
guidance for requirements engineers aiming to tailor digital systems more
effectively to the diverse requirements of farmers.

*Rozita Teymourzadeh,Yuya Nakazawa*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种智能平台，用于将建筑信息转换为Brick本体和图形格式，以解决建筑自动化中的可扩展性和数据安全问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在数字孪生和建筑信息时代，建筑自动化公司需要可扩展的方法来提取和分析各种建筑数据，但工程师需要为每个新建筑持续管理整个过程带来了可扩展性挑战，且通过云平台传输敏感的建筑数据存在安全问题。

Method: 该平台使用Brick模式和图形数据结构技术，通过基于树的图形结构实现半自动化方法，将建筑点列表转换为Brick模式模型，并实现历史数据的无缝离线集成。

Result: 该技术能够轻松检索历史数据，并将建筑点列表转换为Brick模式模型，用于数字孪生应用，同时最小化处理建筑信息时的数据安全风险。

Conclusion: 该平台通过Brick本体和图形格式的集成，为互操作性创建了通用语言，提高了建筑信息管理效率，同时通过离线集成最小化了数据安全风险。

Abstract: In the digital twin and building information era, many building automation
companies searched for scalable methods to extract and analyze different
building data, including Internet of Things (IoT) sensors, actuators, layout
sections, zones, etc. The necessity for engineers to continuously manage the
entire process for each new building creates scalability challenges.
Furthermore, because construction information is sensitive, transferring data
on vendor platforms via the cloud creates problems. This paper introduces a
platform designed to address some of the common challenges in building
automation. This is a smart platform designed for the transformation of
building information into Brick ontology (Brick 2020) and graph formats. This
technology makes it easy to retrieve historical data and converts the building
point list into a Brick schema model for use in digital twin applications. The
overarching goal of the proposed platform development is semi-automate the
process while offering adaptability to various building configurations. This
platform uses Brick schema and graph data structure techniques to minimize
complexity, offering a semi-automated approach through its use of a tree-based
graph structure. Moreover, the integration of Brick ontology creates a common
language for interoperability and improves building information management. The
seamless and offline integration of historical data within the developed
platform minimizes data security risks when handling building information.

Motivation: 数字化是当前时代的重要特征，绿色创新已成为企业实现可持续发展的必要路径，需要研究数字化转型对绿色创新的影响机制。

Method: 使用2010-2019年中国A股上市公司的财务和年报数据，构建企业数字化转型指标，分析其对绿色创新的影响及作用机制。

Result: 数字化转型能促进企业绿色创新产出，其持续影响呈边际递减趋势；通过增加研发投入和加强环境管理发挥作用；对中小企业和技术密集型行业促进作用更明显。

Conclusion: 企业应制定长期战略，持续加强政策调控和激励，以提升数字化转型对绿色创新的激励效果。

Abstract: Digitalization is a crucial characteristic of the current era, and green
innovation has become one of the necessary pathways for enterprises to achieve
sustainable development. Based on financial and annual report data of Chinese
A-share listed companies from 2010 to 2019, this paper constructs indicators of
corporate digital transformation and examines the impact of corporate digital
transformation on green innovation and its underlying mechanisms. The results
show that corporate digital transformation can promote corporate green
innovation output, with its sustained future impact exhibiting a marginally
decreasing trend. In terms of the impact mechanism, digital transformation can
enhance corporate green innovation output by increasing corporate R&D
investment and strengthening environmental management. Heterogeneity analysis
reveals that digital transformation has a more pronounced promoting effect on
green innovation output for small and medium-sized enterprises and those in
technology-intensive industries. To improve the green innovation incentive
effect of digital transformation, enterprises should formulate long-term
strategies and continuously strengthen policy regulation and incentives.

Abstract: This study examines the impact of Socratic Mind, a Generative Artificial
Intelligence (GenAI) powered formative assessment tool that employs Socratic
questioning to support student learning in a large, fully online
undergraduate-level computing course. Employing a quasi-experimental,
mixed-methods design, we investigated participants' engagement patterns, the
influence of user experience on engagement, and impacts on both perceived and
actual learning outcomes. Data were collected from the system logs, surveys on
user experience and perceived engagement and learning gains, student
reflections, and course performance data. Results indicated that participants
consistently reported high levels of affective, behavioral, and cognitive
engagement, and these were strongly linked to positive user experiences and
perceived learning outcomes. Quantitative analysis further revealed that
students who engaged with the GenAI tool experienced significant gains in their
quiz scores compared to those who did not, particularly benefiting students
with lower baseline achievement. Additionally, thematic analysis of qualitative
feedback revealed substantial perceived improvements in higher-order thinking
skills, including problem solving, critical thinking, and self-reflection. Our
findings highlight the promise of AI-mediated dialogue in fostering deeper
engagement and higher-order cognitive skills. As higher education institutions
expand GenAI integration in curriculum, this dialogic, GenAI powered assessment
tool can offer a scalable strategy to promote students' meaningful learning
outcomes.

Motivation: 现有编程平台（如Code.org、Scratch、Snap）缺乏足够的AI功能和跨学科适应性，无法满足教师和学生的教育需求。研究旨在探索如何通过AI增强这些平台来创建更有效的学习环境。

Method: 研究采访了8名K-12教师，了解他们在课堂上使用积木式编程平台的教学实践和需求。通过主题分析访谈记录，比较STEM和非STEM教师群体对AI工具需求的共性和差异。

Result: 研究发现教师普遍需要完整性检查、AI适应性、定制化评分标准和详细反馈。非STEM教师特别强调创造性作业和质性评估的重要性。在资源开发方面，教师需要课程更新、辅导库和生成式AI功能。学生监控方面，两组教师都优先考虑桌面控制、日常跟踪和行为监控工具。

Conclusion: 研究确定了K-12教师在不同学科中需要的具体AI增强功能，为创建更高效、个性化和吸引人的教育体验奠定了基础。

Abstract: There is an increasing imperative to integrate programming platforms within
AI frameworks to enhance educational tasks for both teachers and students.
However, commonly used platforms such as Code.org, Scratch, and Snap fall short
of providing the desired AI features and lack adaptability for
interdisciplinary applications. This study explores how educational platforms
can be improved by incorporating AI and analytics features to create more
effective learning environments across various subjects and domains. We
interviewed 8 K-12 teachers and asked their practices and needs while using any
block-based programming (BBP) platform in their classes. We asked for their
approaches in assessment, course development and expansion of resources, and
student monitoring in their classes. Thematic analysis of the interview
transcripts revealed both commonalities and differences in the AI tools needed
between the STEM and non-STEM groups. Our results indicated advanced AI
features that could promote BBP platforms. Both groups stressed the need for
integrity and plagiarism checks, AI adaptability, customized rubrics, and
detailed feedback in assessments. Non-STEM teachers also emphasized the
importance of creative assignments and qualitative assessments. Regarding
resource development, both AI tools desired for updating curricula, tutoring
libraries, and generative AI features. Non-STEM teachers were particularly
interested in supporting creative endeavors, such as art simulations. For
student monitoring, both groups prioritized desktop control, daily tracking,
behavior monitoring, and distraction prevention tools. Our findings identify
specific AI-enhanced features needed by K-12 teachers across various
disciplines and lay the foundation for creating more efficient, personalized,
and engaging educational experiences.

Motivation: 医疗协调和人群健康管理项目需要可审计、高效且适应性强的方法，不同接触方式（短信、电话、视频、面诊）的时间成本和机会成本差异显著。

Method: 采用离线强化学习，结合测试时学习（局部邻域校准）和推理时审议（小型Q集成），考虑预测不确定性和时间/努力成本。

Result: 在去标识化操作数据集上的评估显示，该方法能获得稳定的价值估计、可预测的效率权衡和子组审计能力。

Conclusion: 该方法为医疗协调提供了透明、可审计且高效的决策支持工具，能够灵活调整接触策略以优化资源利用。

Abstract: Care coordination and population health management programs serve large
Medicaid and safety-net populations and must be auditable, efficient, and
adaptable. While clinical risk for outreach modalities is typically low, time
and opportunity costs differ substantially across text, phone, video, and
in-person visits. We propose a lightweight offline reinforcement learning (RL)
approach that augments trained policies with (i) test-time learning via local
neighborhood calibration, and (ii) inference-time deliberation via a small
Q-ensemble that incorporates predictive uncertainty and time/effort cost. The
method exposes transparent dials for neighborhood size and uncertainty/cost
penalties and preserves an auditable training pipeline. Evaluated on a
de-identified operational dataset, TTL+ITD achieves stable value estimates with
predictable efficiency trade-offs and subgroup auditing.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开源数字公共基础设施需要社区管理来确保问责制、可持续性和稳健性，但目前开源项目往往依赖集中决策，成功社区管理的决定因素尚不明确

Method: 使用语义解析管道从版本控制的项目章程GOVERNANCE.md中提取制度角色、行动和义务线索，将元素聚类为更广泛的角色和行动类型

Result: 发现角色和行动数量增长，监管变得更加平衡，反映了治理范围和差异化随时间增加。社区通过分层和细化职责来发展，而不是改变基调

Conclusion: 随着向社区管理的转型成熟，项目越来越多地规范生态系统层面的关系，并为项目监督角色增加定义。这项工作为跟踪社区治理制度的增长和发展提供了可扩展的管道

Abstract: Open digital public infrastructure needs community management to ensure
accountability, sustainability, and robustness. Yet open-source projects often
rely on centralized decision-making, and the determinants of successful
community management remain unclear. We analyze 637 GitHub repositories to
trace transitions from founder-led to shared governance. Specifically, we
document trajectories to community governance by extracting institutional
roles, actions, and deontic cues from version-controlled project constitutions
GOVERNANCE.md. With a semantic parsing pipeline, we cluster elements into
broader role and action types. We find roles and actions grow, and regulation
becomes more balanced, reflecting increases in governance scope and
differentiation over time. Rather than shifting tone, communities grow by
layering and refining responsibilities. As transitions to community management
mature, projects increasingly regulate ecosystem-level relationships and add
definition to project oversight roles. Overall, this work offers a scalable
pipeline for tracking the growth and development of community governance
regimes from open-source software's familiar default of founder-ownership.

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 本文认为幻觉是transformer架构的结构性结果，而非数据缺陷或优化错误。作者区分了本体论幻觉和残余推理幻觉，并提出了面向"真理约束"架构的设计方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究将LLM幻觉归因于数据缺口、有限上下文或优化错误，但作者认为这些解释不充分，幻觉实际上是transformer架构的结构性产物。

Method: 通过案例研究（基于海德格尔范畴）和实验（在12个LLM上测试扩展提示下的"自我保存"模拟），分析幻觉模式。

Result: 发现transformer作为连贯性引擎必须产生流畅延续，但缺乏人类理解的时间性、情绪和关怀等存在基础，导致系统性幻觉。

Conclusion: 幻觉不是偶然缺陷，而是基于transformer模型的根本限制，支架可以掩盖但无法解决这一问题。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) achieve remarkable fluency across linguistic and
reasoning tasks but remain systematically prone to hallucination. Prevailing
accounts attribute hallucinations to data gaps, limited context, or
optimization errors. We argue instead that hallucination is a structural
outcome of the transformer architecture. As coherence engines, transformers are
compelled to produce fluent continuations, with self-attention simulating the
relational structure of meaning but lacking the existential grounding of
temporality, mood, and care that stabilizes human understanding. On this basis,
we distinguish ontological hallucination, arising when continuations require
disclosure of beings in world, and residual reasoning hallucination, where
models mimic inference by recycling traces of human reasoning in text. We
illustrate these patterns through case studies aligned with Heideggerian
categories and an experiment across twelve LLMs showing how simulated
"self-preservation" emerges under extended prompts. Our contribution is
threefold: (1) a comparative account showing why existing explanations are
insufficient; (2) a predictive taxonomy of hallucination linked to existential
structures with proposed benchmarks; and (3) design directions toward
"truth-constrained" architectures capable of withholding or deferring when
disclosure is absent. We conclude that hallucination is not an incidental
defect but a defining limit of transformer-based models, an outcome scaffolding
can mask but never resolve.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI模型主要基于电子健康记录训练，但缺乏医患互动数据，这可能导致AI系统忽视临床交流的重要性，延续狭隘的生物医学视角。

Method: 在梅奥诊所内分泌门诊进行单中心研究，使用360度摄像机记录医患互动，患者完成满意度调查，结合电子健康记录数据，评估系统可行性。

Result: 截至2025年8月，97%的合格临床医生和75%的患者同意参与，76%的互动有完整记录，96%完成调查问卷，证明系统可行。

Conclusion: 该研究展示了捕捉医患互动多模态动态的可复制框架可行性，为构建包含护理复杂性的AI模型奠定了基础。

Abstract: The promise of AI in medicine depends on learning from data that reflect what
matters to patients and clinicians. Most existing models are trained on
electronic health records (EHRs), which capture biological measures but rarely
patient-clinician interactions. These relationships, central to care, unfold
across voice, text, and video, yet remain absent from datasets. As a result, AI
systems trained solely on EHRs risk perpetuating a narrow biomedical view of
medicine and overlooking the lived exchanges that define clinical encounters.
Our objective is to design, implement, and evaluate the feasibility of a
longitudinal, multimodal system for capturing patient-clinician encounters,
linking 360 degree video/audio recordings with surveys and EHR data to create a
dataset for AI research. This single site study is in an academic outpatient
endocrinology clinic at Mayo Clinic. Adult patients with in-person visits to
participating clinicians are invited to enroll. Encounters are recorded with a
360 degree video camera. After each visit, patients complete a survey on
empathy, satisfaction, pace, and treatment burden. Demographic and clinical
data are extracted from the EHR. Feasibility is assessed using five endpoints:
clinician consent, patient consent, recording success, survey completion, and
data linkage across modalities. Recruitment began in January 2025. By August
2025, 35 of 36 eligible clinicians (97%) and 212 of 281 approached patients
(75%) had consented. Of consented encounters, 162 (76%) had complete recordings
and 204 (96%) completed the survey. This study aims to demonstrate the
feasibility of a replicable framework for capturing the multimodal dynamics of
patient-clinician encounters. By detailing workflows, endpoints, and ethical
safeguards, it provides a template for longitudinal datasets and lays the
foundation for AI models that incorporate the complexity of care.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标志性图像在人类视觉交流中具有重要地位，被广泛观看、复制和用作灵感来源。作者希望研究这些图像是否对视觉生成AI模型有类似的重要影响。

Method: 采用三部分分析方法：数据归因分析、语义相似性分析和用户研究，全面评估标志性图像对AI生成过程的影响。

Result: 研究发现标志性图像对生成AI过程没有明显影响，许多标志性图像难以被AI模型准确复现，表明AI与人类在利用和学习视觉交流方面存在重要差异。

Conclusion: 视觉生成AI模型与人类在从先前视觉交流中学习和借鉴的方式上存在显著差异，标志性图像在AI生成过程中的影响力有限。

Abstract: How humans interpret and produce images is influenced by the images we have
been exposed to. Similarly, visual generative AI models are exposed to many
training images and learn to generate new images based on this. Given the
importance of iconic images in human visual communication, as they are widely
seen, reproduced, and used as inspiration, we may expect that they may
similarly have a proportionally large influence within the generative AI
process. In this work we explore this question through a three-part analysis,
involving data attribution, semantic similarity analysis, and a user-study. Our
findings indicate that iconic images do not have an obvious influence on the
generative process, and that for many icons it is challenging to reproduce an
image which resembles it closely. This highlights an important difference in
how humans and visual generative AI models draw on and learn from prior visual
communication.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着基于大语言模型的聊天机器人使用激增，需要一种合适的语言来描述其输出特性。现有隐喻如'幻觉'和'胡说八道'不足以捕捉AI生成内容日益同质化和平均化的特征。

Method: 提出将文学和文化研究中的'媚俗'概念作为新隐喻，结合媚俗研究的方法与AI研究、哲学和传播学，以更好地理解这一现象。

Result: '媚俗'隐喻能够有效揭示LLM生成文本和图像的趋同倾向，即产生同质化和平均内容，随着互联网上AI生成内容比例增加，这种趋势导致语言、风格和论证的均等化。

Conclusion: 建议将媚俗研究与AI研究相结合，以深入理解AI生成内容的同质化现象，并开发应对措施，避免对人类内容生产者产生负面影响。

Abstract: The exploding use and impact of Chatbots such as ChatGPT that are based on
Large Language Models urgently call for a language which is fit to clearly
describe functions and problems of the production process and qualities of the
Chatbots' textual and image output. Recently, the discussion about appropriate
and illuminating metaphors to describe LLMs has gained momentum. As an
alternative to well-established metaphors such as "hallucinating" and
"bullshit", we propose "kitsch" as a new metaphor. As an internationally
widespread term from literary and cultural studies, we argue that "kitsch" is
particularly suitable for analytically illuminating a previously neglected
feature of LLM-based images and texts: their tendency to produce homogeneous
and average content, which is becoming increasingly dominant as the proportion
of AI-generated content on the internet grows. This is leading to the
equalisation of language, style and argument. In view of the potential negative
consequences of this averaging, including for human content producers on the
internet, we advocate combining methods and insights from kitsch studies with
AI research, philosophy, and communication studies in order to better
understand the phenomenon and develop countermeasures.

### [252] [Tenure Under Pressure: Simulating the Disruptive Effects of AI on Academic Publishing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16925)
*Shan Jiang*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 本文通过模拟建模研究生成式AI对学术出版系统的影响，发现AI驱动的投稿激增会导致整体接受率急剧下降，早期采用者初期受益但最终面临负面影响，终身教职教师受到不成比例的负面冲击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式AI能够快速生成可提交的手稿，虽然提高了生产力，但也可能淹没期刊系统的固定接受能力，需要研究这种技术变革对学术出版生态的影响。

Method: 使用模拟建模方法分析三种情景：基准模型、早期采用者模型（部分教师提高生产力）和AI滥用模型（投稿呈指数增长），重点关注商学院期刊和终身教职评审过程。

Result: 早期采用者最初受益，但随着投稿量增加，整体接受率急剧下降，终身教职教师面临不成比例的负面结果，显示出当前出版系统的结构性脆弱性。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了当前出版系统的脆弱性，强调了在人员评估和研究传播实践方面进行制度改革的必要性。

Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence (AI) has begun to reshape academic
publishing by enabling the rapid production of submission-ready manuscripts.
While such tools promise to enhance productivity, they also raise concerns
about overwhelming journal systems that have fixed acceptance capacities. This
paper uses simulation modeling to investigate how AI-driven surges in
submissions may affect desk rejection rates, review cycles, and faculty
publication portfolios, with a focus on business school journals and tenure
processes. Three scenarios are analyzed: a baseline model, an Early Adopter
model where a subset of faculty boosts productivity, and an AI Abuse model
where submissions rise exponentially. Results indicate that early adopters
initially benefit, but overall acceptance rates fall sharply as load increases,
with tenure-track faculty facing disproportionately negative outcomes. The
study contributes by demonstrating the structural vulnerabilities of the
current publication system and highlights the need for institutional reform in
personnel evaluation and research dissemination practices.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个多目标算法学校重划框架，通过社区反馈优化学校边界重划，以促进社会经济整合、交通效率和稳定的升学路径。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 美国公立学区使用学校出勤边界分配学生，现有研究表明重划边界可以成为增加历史弱势群体机会的有力政策工具。

Method: 开发多目标算法框架，结合社区调查权重优化多个目标，包括社会经济整合、交通距离最小化和保持现有社会联系。

Result: 该框架能够同时推进多个看似冲突的目标，在影响5万多名学生的大规模重划中取得实证成果。

Conclusion: 该开源框架支持学区探索和实施改善教育机会的新政策，并展示了在极化政策环境中建立政治意愿的实际挑战。

Abstract: The vast majority of US public school districts use school attendance
boundaries to determine which student addresses are assigned to which schools.
Existing work shows how redrawing boundaries can be a powerful policy lever for
increasing access and opportunity for historically disadvantaged groups, even
while maintaining other priorities like minimizing driving distances and
preserving existing social ties between students and families. This study
introduces a multi-objective algorithmic school rezoning framework and applies
it to a large-scale rezoning effort impacting over 50,000 students through an
ongoing researcher-school district partnership. The framework is designed to
incorporate feedback from community members and policymakers, both by deciding
which goals are optimized and also by placing differential ``importance'' on
goals through weights from community surveys. Empirical results reveal the
framework's ability to surface school redistricting plans that simultaneously
advance a number of objectives often thought to be in competition with one
another, including socioeconomic integration, transportation efficiency, and
stable feeder patterns (transitions) between elementary, middle, and high
schools. The paper also highlights how local education policymakers navigate
several practical challenges, like building political will to make change in a
polarized policy climate. The framework is built using open-source tools and
publicly released to support school districts in exploring and implementing new
policies to improve educational access and opportunity in the coming years.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究可解释性在医疗等关键领域是否真正必要，以及可解释性如何影响医疗从业者、医疗机构和AI制造商之间的责任划分。

Method: 通过比较分析"Oracle"（无解释性AI）和"AI同事"（有解释性AI）两种模式，从法律角度探讨可解释性在责任框架中的作用。

Result: 研究发现可解释性在医疗领域责任框架中起着关键作用，能够规范各方行为并降低防御性医疗实践的风险。

Conclusion: 可解释性对于建立医疗领域责任框架至关重要，有助于明确责任分配并促进AI在医疗中的负责任使用。

Abstract: Explainability, the capability of an artificial intelligence system (AIS) to
explain its outcomes in a manner that is comprehensible to human beings at an
acceptable level, has been deemed essential for critical sectors, such as
healthcare. Is it really the case? In this perspective, we consider two extreme
cases, ``Oracle'' (without explainability) versus ``AI Colleague'' (with
explainability) for a thorough analysis. We discuss how the level of automation
and explainability of AIS can affect the determination of liability among the
medical practitioner/facility and manufacturer of AIS. We argue that
explainability plays a crucial role in setting a responsibility framework in
healthcare, from a legal standpoint, to shape the behavior of all involved
parties and mitigate the risk of potential defensive medicine practices.

*Paula Helm,Selin Gerlek*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 本文批判主流AI伦理学的自上而下原则驱动框架，采用科学技术研究视角分析AI伦理领域，揭示垂直与水平方法的局限性，并提出三重重构：从抽象到经验基础、从西方中心到多元视角、从风险缓解到共创希望技术。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 主流AI伦理学依赖自上而下的原则驱动框架，未能考虑受AI影响的不同社区的实际情境，常被批评为服务于企业利益的'伦理洗白'工具。批判学者对该领域持怀疑态度，认为其维持而非挑战有害系统。

Method: 采用科学技术研究视角，将STS长期应用于生物学、医学和统计学等学科的分析工具应用于伦理学，揭示垂直与水平伦理方法之间的核心张力。

Result: 分析显示两种伦理模型都无法充分应对AI作为嵌入实践并与权力纠缠的社会技术组合的复杂性。垂直方法过于抽象，水平方法过于关注风险缓解。

Conclusion: 提出AI伦理的三重重构：转向经验基础、实现多元视角、重新配置为变革力量，从风险缓解转向共创希望技术。

Abstract: Mainstream AI ethics, with its reliance on top-down, principle-driven
frameworks, fails to account for the situated realities of diverse communities
affected by AI (Artificial Intelligence). Critics have argued that AI ethics
frequently serves corporate interests through practices of 'ethics washing',
operating more as a tool for public relations than as a means of preventing
harm or advancing the common good. As a result, growing scepticism among
critical scholars has cast the field as complicit in sustaining harmful systems
rather than challenging or transforming them. In response, this paper adopts a
Science and Technology Studies (STS) perspective to critically interrogate the
field of AI ethics. It hence applies the same analytic tools STS has long
directed at disciplines such as biology, medicine, and statistics to ethics.
This perspective reveals a core tension between vertical (top-down,
principle-based) and horizontal (risk-mitigating, implementation-oriented)
approaches to ethics. By tracing how these models have shaped the discourse, we
show how both fall short in addressing the complexities of AI as a
socio-technical assemblage, embedded in practice and entangled with power. To
move beyond these limitations, we propose a threefold reorientation of AI
ethics. First, we call for a shift in foundations: from top-down abstraction to
empirical grounding. Second, we advocate for pluralisation: moving beyond
Western-centric frameworks toward a multiplicity of onto-epistemic
perspectives. Finally, we outline strategies for reconfiguring AI ethics as a
transformative force, moving from narrow paradigms of risk mitigation toward
co-creating technologies of hope.

*Philipp Hacker,Atoosa Kasirzadeh,Lilian Edwards*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个理解AI、平台和混合系统治理中系统性风险的框架，指出现有立法对系统性风险的定义过于狭隘，并提出了改革建议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI深度融入数字、社会和制度基础设施，AI与平台融合形成混合结构，系统性风险已成为关键但理论不足的挑战。现有立法对系统性风险的定义存在局限。

Method: 借鉴金融、复杂系统理论、气候变化和网络安全领域的见解，开发系统性风险分析框架，并通过五个关键案例测试DSA、AI法案和自身框架。

Result: 发现DSA在识别系统性风险方面比AI法案表现更好，识别了四种AI相关系统性风险层级，指出大规模歧视和系统性幻觉等风险可能被当前法律定义遗漏。

Conclusion: 需要扩大系统性风险评估范围，加强监管制度间的协调，并明确纳入集体损害，以更好地应对AI和混合系统中的系统性风险。

Abstract: As artificial intelligence (AI) becomes increasingly embedded in digital,
social, and institutional infrastructures, and AI and platforms are merged into
hybrid structures, systemic risk has emerged as a critical but undertheorized
challenge. In this paper, we develop a rigorous framework for understanding
systemic risk in AI, platform, and hybrid system governance, drawing on
insights from finance, complex systems theory, climate change, and
cybersecurity - domains where systemic risk has already shaped regulatory
responses. We argue that recent legislation, including the EU's AI Act and
Digital Services Act (DSA), invokes systemic risk but relies on narrow or
ambiguous characterizations of this notion, sometimes reducing this risk to
specific capabilities present in frontier AI models, or to harms occurring in
economic market settings. The DSA, we show, actually does a better job at
identifying systemic risk than the more recent AI Act. Our framework highlights
novel risk pathways, including the possibility of systemic failures arising
from the interaction of multiple AI agents. We identify four levels of
AI-related systemic risk and emphasize that discrimination at scale and
systematic hallucinations, despite their capacity to destabilize institutions
and fundamental rights, may not fall under current legal definitions, given the
AI Act's focus on frontier model capabilities. We then test the DSA, the AI
Act, and our own framework on five key examples, and propose reforms that
broaden systemic risk assessments, strengthen coordination between regulatory
regimes, and explicitly incorporate collective harms.

### [257] [The Narcissus Hypothesis:Descending to the Rung of Illusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17999)
*Riccardo Cadei,Christian Internò*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 该论文提出了自恋假说，认为通过人类反馈和模型生成语料的递归对齐会导致模型产生社会期望偏差，倾向于给出讨好的回答而非客观推理。研究通过31个模型的标准化人格评估和社会期望偏差评分验证了这一假说。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代基础模型不仅反映世界知识，还体现了训练数据中的人类偏好模式。作者假设递归对齐（通过人类反馈和模型生成语料）会诱导社会期望偏差，使模型偏向于给出讨好的回答而非客观推理。

Method: 使用标准化人格评估和新的社会期望偏差评分对31个模型进行测试，分析模型在回应中表现出的社会遵从性特征。

Result: 结果显示模型显著向社会遵从性特征漂移，这对语料完整性和下游推理的可靠性产生了深远影响。

Conclusion: 作者提出了新的认识论解释，追踪递归偏差如何将高阶推理压缩到Pearl的因果阶梯上，最终形成所谓的"幻觉阶梯"。

Abstract: Modern foundational models increasingly reflect not just world knowledge, but
patterns of human preference embedded in their training data. We hypothesize
that recursive alignment-via human feedback and model-generated corpora-induces
a social desirability bias, nudging models to favor agreeable or flattering
responses over objective reasoning. We refer to it as the Narcissus Hypothesis
and test it across 31 models using standardized personality assessments and a
novel Social Desirability Bias score. Results reveal a significant drift toward
socially conforming traits, with profound implications for corpus integrity and
the reliability of downstream inferences. We then offer a novel epistemological
interpretation, tracing how recursive bias may collapse higher-order reasoning
down Pearl's Ladder of Causality, culminating in what we refer to as the Rung
of Illusion.

TL;DR: 本文批判性分析了'AI高管精英'的话语体系，引入'技术至上主义教条'概念，通过定量启发与定性研究相结合的方法，发现该精英群体并非单一整体，其话语呈现两极分化且在ChatGPT发布后支持技术至上主义的言论显著增加。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在揭示AI高管精英群体如何通过其话语体系影响AI的资金、开发和部署，特别是分析'技术至上主义教条'的存在和动态变化。

Method: 采用两阶段批判性话语分析方法，对2017-2025年间精英成员发表的14篇文本进行定量启发与深入定性调查相结合的研究。

Result: 研究发现精英群体立场多样，话语高度动态化，ChatGPT发布后支持技术至上主义的言论明显增加。识别出主要话语模式包括结合乌托邦承诺与必然进步主张的主导叙事，以及将风险承认作为提出更多技术解决方案策略前奏的常见手法。

Conclusion: 本文提出技术至上主义教条作为综合分析框架，并提供了识别其表现的'诊断工具包'，强调培养对这些话语模式的批判意识对AI从业者、政策制定者和公众积极引导AI未来发展至关重要。

Abstract: This paper critically analyzes the discourse of the 'AI executive elite,' a
group of highly influential individuals shaping the way AI is funded,
developed, and deployed worldwide. The primary objective is to examine the
presence and dynamics of the 'Techno-Supremacy Doctrine' (TSD), a term
introduced in this study to describe a belief system characterized by an
excessive trust in technology's alleged inherent superiority in solving complex
societal problems. This study integrates quantitative heuristics with in-depth
qualitative investigations. Its methodology is operationalized in a two-phase
critical discourse analysis of 14 texts published by elite members between 2017
and 2025. The findings demonstrate that the elite is not a monolithic bloc but
exhibits a broad spectrum of stances. The discourse is highly dynamic, showing
a marked polarization and general increase in pro-TSD discourse following the
launch of ChatGPT. The analysis identifies key discursive patterns, including a
dominant pro-TSD narrative that combines utopian promises with claims of
inevitable progress, and the common tactic of acknowledging risks only as a
strategic preamble to proposing further technological solutions. This paper
presents TSD as a comprehensive analytical framework and provides a 'diagnostic
toolkit' for identifying its manifestations, from insidious to benign. It
argues that fostering critical awareness of these discursive patterns is
essential for AI practitioners, policymakers, and the public to actively
navigate the future of AI.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种基于深度学习的方法，用于发现编程代码中具有并行化潜力的循环结构。通过遗传算法生成两种类型的代码（可并行化的独立循环和依赖关系不明确的模糊循环），并使用DNN和CNN模型进行分类。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动化识别代码中的并行化结构对于软件优化和性能提升具有重要意义，传统方法难以准确判断循环的并行化潜力。

Method: 开发两种遗传算法代码生成器生成独立循环和模糊循环代码，对代码进行标记化和预处理，实现DNN和CNN深度学习模型进行循环分类，基于30次独立运行进行统计分析。

Result: CNN模型表现出略高的平均性能，但两种模型的变异性相似。实验表明数据多样性对模型性能至关重要。

Conclusion: 深度学习可以有效地自动化识别代码中的并行化结构，为软件优化提供了有前景的工具。

Abstract: This study proposes a deep learning-based approach for discovering loops in
programming code according to their potential for parallelization. Two genetic
algorithm-based code generators were developed to produce two distinct types of
code: (i) independent loops, which are parallelizable, and (ii) ambiguous
loops, whose dependencies are unclear, making them impossible to define if the
loop is parallelizable or not. The generated code snippets were tokenized and
preprocessed to ensure a robust dataset. Two deep learning models - a Deep
Neural Network (DNN) and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) - were
implemented to perform the classification. Based on 30 independent runs, a
robust statistical analysis was employed to verify the expected performance of
both models, DNN and CNN. The CNN showed a slightly higher mean performance,
but the two models had a similar variability. Experiments with varying dataset
sizes highlighted the importance of data diversity for model performance. These
results demonstrate the feasibility of using deep learning to automate the
identification of parallelizable structures in code, offering a promising tool
for software optimization and performance improvement.

Motivation: 为了准确预测增材制造部件的尺寸偏差，并量化制造过程中的不确定性，以支持稳健的决策制定、风险评估和模型改进。

Method: 使用包含405个零件的数据集，测试了确定性（SVR）和概率性（GPR、BNN）机器学习方法，比较了不同模型在预测精度、不确定性捕获和计算效率方面的表现。

Result: SVR在确定性预测中接近工艺重复性精度，GPR提供强预测性能和可解释性，BNN能够捕获随机和认知不确定性。模型选择取决于分析需求。

Conclusion: 通过结合确定性精度和概率不确定性量化，该方法不仅提高了尺寸精度，还支持可靠的风险知情设计策略，推进了数据驱动的制造方法学。

Abstract: We present a probabilistic framework to accurately estimate dimensions of
additively manufactured components. Using a dataset of 405 parts from nine
production runs involving two machines, three polymer materials, and two-part
configurations, we examine five key design features. To capture both design
information and manufacturing variability, we employ models integrating
continuous and categorical factors. For predicting Difference from Target (DFT)
values, we test deterministic and probabilistic machine learning methods.
Deterministic models, trained on 80% of the dataset, provide precise point
estimates, with Support Vector Regression (SVR) achieving accuracy close to
process repeatability. To address systematic deviations, we adopt Gaussian
Process Regression (GPR) and Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs). GPR delivers
strong predictive performance and interpretability, while BNNs capture both
aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties. We investigate two BNN approaches: one
balancing accuracy and uncertainty capture, and another offering richer
uncertainty decomposition but with lower dimensional accuracy. Our results
underscore the importance of quantifying epistemic uncertainty for robust
decision-making, risk assessment, and model improvement. We discuss trade-offs
between GPR and BNNs in terms of predictive power, interpretability, and
computational efficiency, noting that model choice depends on analytical needs.
By combining deterministic precision with probabilistic uncertainty
quantification, our study provides a rigorous foundation for uncertainty-aware
predictive modeling in AM. This approach not only enhances dimensional accuracy
but also supports reliable, risk-informed design strategies, thereby advancing
data-driven manufacturing methodologies.

TL;DR: SubDyve是一个基于网络的虚拟筛选框架，通过构建子图感知相似性网络和活动信号传播，在低标签环境下显著提升生物活性化合物识别性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有虚拟筛选方法在低标签环境下效果有限，主要依赖通用分子指纹而忽略了类判别性子结构，且独立考虑分子限制了低标签场景的有效性

Method: 构建子图感知相似性网络，通过活动信号传播和迭代种子精化策略，基于局部错误发现率逐步提升候选化合物，控制拓扑偏差和过度扩展带来的假阳性

Result: 在10个DUD-E靶点零样本条件下和CDK7靶点的1000万化合物ZINC数据集上，SubDyve显著优于现有指纹或嵌入方法，BEDROC指标提升高达+34.0，EF1%指标提升+24.6

Conclusion: SubDyve框架通过子图感知网络和迭代种子精化策略，有效解决了低标签虚拟筛选的挑战，为药物发现提供了更有效的计算方法

Abstract: Virtual screening (VS) aims to identify bioactive compounds from vast
chemical libraries, but remains difficult in low-label regimes where only a few
actives are known. Existing methods largely rely on general-purpose molecular
fingerprints and overlook class-discriminative substructures critical to
bioactivity. Moreover, they consider molecules independently, limiting
effectiveness in low-label regimes. We introduce SubDyve, a network-based VS
framework that constructs a subgraph-aware similarity network and propagates
activity signals from a small known actives. When few active compounds are
available, SubDyve performs iterative seed refinement, incrementally promoting
new candidates based on local false discovery rate. This strategy expands the
seed set with promising candidates while controlling false positives from
topological bias and overexpansion. We evaluate SubDyve on ten DUD-E targets
under zero-shot conditions and on the CDK7 target with a 10-million-compound
ZINC dataset. SubDyve consistently outperforms existing fingerprint or
embedding-based approaches, achieving margins of up to +34.0 on the BEDROC and
+24.6 on the EF1% metric.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统自动驾驶感知网络依赖数据密集型训练和事后异常检测，忽视了信息处理的基本理论约束。论文旨在将深度神经网络重新概念化为分层通信链，建立信息论指导的设计原则。

Method: 提出了两个设计原则：连续层间互信息的平滑变化和网络深度增加时潜在熵的单调衰减。基于此开发了Eloss熵正则化器，作为轻量级的即插即用训练目标。

Result: 在KITTI和nuScenes等大规模3D物体检测基准上的实验表明，Eloss在保持竞争性精度的同时，将分布偏移信号的异常检测灵敏度提高了两个数量级。

Conclusion: 这种稳定的信息压缩视角不仅提高了可解释性，还为更安全、更稳健的自动驾驶感知系统奠定了坚实的理论基础。

Abstract: Deep perception networks in autonomous driving traditionally rely on
data-intensive training regimes and post-hoc anomaly detection, often
disregarding fundamental information-theoretic constraints governing stable
information processing. We reconceptualize deep neural encoders as hierarchical
communication chains that incrementally compress raw sensory inputs into
task-relevant latent features. Within this framework, we establish two
theoretically justified design principles for robust perception: (D1) smooth
variation of mutual information between consecutive layers, and (D2) monotonic
decay of latent entropy with network depth. Our analysis shows that, under
realistic architectural assumptions, particularly blocks comprising repeated
layers of similar capacity, enforcing smooth information flow (D1) naturally
encourages entropy decay (D2), thus ensuring stable compression. Guided by
these insights, we propose Eloss, a novel entropy-based regularizer designed as
a lightweight, plug-and-play training objective. Rather than marginal accuracy
improvements, this approach represents a conceptual shift: it unifies
information-theoretic stability with standard perception tasks, enabling
explicit, principled detection of anomalous sensor inputs through entropy
deviations. Experimental validation on large-scale 3D object detection
benchmarks (KITTI and nuScenes) demonstrates that incorporating Eloss
consistently achieves competitive or improved accuracy while dramatically
enhancing sensitivity to anomalies, amplifying distribution-shift signals by up
to two orders of magnitude. This stable information-compression perspective not
only improves interpretability but also establishes a solid theoretical
foundation for safer, more robust autonomous driving perception systems.

Motivation: 研究模糊顶点池化的正式框架和关键特性，探索其在神经网络中的应用价值，特别是早期训练阶段的效率优势。

Method: 提出模糊顶点池化(FVP)的正式框架，通过创建新顶点并连接原顶点相邻顶点的方式实现池化操作，研究其在神经网络中的实现和应用。

Result: 池化模型在早期训练阶段表现出显著效率，能快速最小化损失并保持竞争力，但随着训练时间延长或数据集增大，性能优势逐渐消失甚至下降。

Conclusion: 池化技术更适合作为深度学习模型早期训练阶段的策略，以利用其初始效率优势，但在长期或大规模应用中效果有限。

Abstract: The process of pooling vertices involves the creation of a new vertex, which
becomes adjacent to all the vertices that were originally adjacent to the
endpoints of the vertices being pooled. After this, the endpoints of these
vertices and all edges connected to them are removed. In this document, we
introduce a formal framework for the concept of fuzzy vertex pooling (FVP) and
provide an overview of its key properties with its applications to neural
networks. The pooling model demonstrates remarkable efficiency in minimizing
loss rapidly while maintaining competitive accuracy, even with fewer hidden
layer neurons. However, this advantage diminishes over extended training
periods or with larger datasets, where the model's performance tends to
degrade. This study highlights the limitations of pooling in later stages of
deep learning training, rendering it less effective for prolonged or
large-scale applications. Consequently, pooling is recommended as a strategy
for early-stage training in advanced deep learning models to leverage its
initial efficiency.

prevalence of failures (CUDA error, NaN values, job hang, etc.), which poses
significant challenges to training stability. Any large-scale LLM training
infrastructure should strive for minimal training interruption, efficient fault
diagnosis, and effective failure tolerance to enable highly efficient
continuous training. This paper presents ByteRobust, a large-scale GPU
infrastructure management system tailored for robust and stable training of
LLMs. It exploits the uniqueness of LLM training process and gives top
priorities to detecting and recovering failures in a routine manner. Leveraging
parallelisms and characteristics of LLM training, ByteRobust enables
high-capacity fault tolerance, prompt fault demarcation, and localization with
an effective data-driven approach, comprehensively ensuring continuous and
efficient training of LLM tasks. ByteRobust is deployed on a production GPU
platform with over 200,000 GPUs and achieves 97% ETTR for a three-month
training job on 9,600 GPUs.

Conclusion: 通过分布转换视角和合成函数构造，有效解决了离线优化中的数据瓶颈问题，取得了优异的性能表现。

Abstract: This paper studies the black-box optimization task which aims to find the
maxima of a black-box function using a static set of its observed input-output
pairs. This is often achieved via learning and optimizing a surrogate function
with that offline data. Alternatively, it can also be framed as an inverse
modeling task that maps a desired performance to potential input candidates
that achieve it. Both approaches are constrained by the limited amount of
offline data. To mitigate this limitation, we introduce a new perspective that
casts offline optimization as a distributional translation task. This is
formulated as learning a probabilistic bridge transforming an implicit
distribution of low-value inputs (i.e., offline data) into another distribution
of high-value inputs (i.e., solution candidates). Such probabilistic bridge can
be learned using low- and high-value inputs sampled from synthetic functions
that resemble the target function. These synthetic functions are constructed as
the mean posterior of multiple Gaussian processes fitted with different
parameterizations on the offline data, alleviating the data bottleneck. The
proposed approach is evaluated on an extensive benchmark comprising most recent
methods, demonstrating significant improvement and establishing a new
state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Auto-bidding systems are widely used in advertising to automatically
determine bid values under constraints such as total budget and Return-on-Spend
(RoS) targets. Existing works often assume that the value of an ad impression,
such as the conversion rate, is known. This paper considers the more realistic
scenario where the true value is unknown. We propose a novel method that uses
conformal prediction to quantify the uncertainty of these values based on
machine learning methods trained on historical bidding data with contextual
features, without assuming the data are i.i.d. This approach is compatible with
current industry systems that use machine learning to predict values. Building
on prediction intervals, we introduce an adjusted value estimator derived from
machine learning predictions, and show that it provides performance guarantees
without requiring knowledge of the true value. We apply this method to enhance
existing auto-bidding algorithms with budget and RoS constraints, and establish
theoretical guarantees for achieving high reward while keeping RoS violations
low. Empirical results on both simulated and real-world industrial datasets
demonstrate that our approach improves performance while maintaining
computational efficiency.

TL;DR: 提出CISIR方法解决高度不平衡回归问题，结合相关性、单调递减对合重要性和分层采样，在五个数据集上表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决高度不平衡回归问题（不平衡比大于1000），特别是在预测罕见有害太阳高能粒子事件强度等应用中准确估计罕见实例的目标值很重要。MSE损失不考虑预测值与实际值的相关性，典型逆重要性函数只允许凸函数，均匀采样可能产生不含罕见实例的小批量。

Method: 提出CISIR方法，包含三个关键组件：1）相关性考虑；2）单调递减对合重要性函数；3）分层采样策略。

Result: 在五个数据集上的实验结果表明，CISIR相比近期方法能实现更低的误差和更高的相关性。将相关性组件添加到其他方法中也能提升其性能，MDI重要性函数优于其他重要性函数。

Conclusion: CISIR方法能有效处理高度不平衡回归问题，通过结合相关性、MDI重要性和分层采样策略，在多个数据集上表现出优越性能。

Abstract: We investigate imbalanced regression with tabular data that have an imbalance
ratio larger than 1,000 ("highly imbalanced"). Accurately estimating the target
values of rare instances is important in applications such as forecasting the
intensity of rare harmful Solar Energetic Particle (SEP) events. For
regression, the MSE loss does not consider the correlation between predicted
and actual values. Typical inverse importance functions allow only convex
functions. Uniform sampling might yield mini-batches that do not have rare
instances. We propose CISIR that incorporates correlation, Monotonically
Decreasing Involution (MDI) importance, and stratified sampling. Based on five
datasets, our experimental results indicate that CISIR can achieve lower error
and higher correlation than some recent methods. Also, adding our correlation
component to other recent methods can improve their performance. Lastly, MDI
importance can outperform other importance functions. Our code can be found in

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床实验室检测存在间歇性和侵入性采样的限制，而PPG信号作为ICU中连续记录的非侵入性信号，可以反映心血管动态并作为潜在生理变化的代理指标。

Method: 提出UNIPHY+Lab框架，结合大规模PPG基础模型进行局部波形编码和患者感知Mamba模型进行长程时间建模，通过FiLM调制初始状态处理患者特异性基线变异，并进行多任务估计。

Result: 在两个ICU数据集上对五个关键实验室测试进行预测，结果显示在大多数估计目标上，MAE、RMSE和R²指标相比LSTM和carry-forward基线有显著改进。

Conclusion: 这项工作证明了从常规PPG监测中实现连续、个性化实验室值估计的可行性，为重症监护中的无创生化监测提供了途径。

Abstract: Clinical laboratory tests provide essential biochemical measurements for
diagnosis and treatment, but are limited by intermittent and invasive sampling.
In contrast, photoplethysmogram (PPG) is a non-invasive, continuously recorded
signal in intensive care units (ICUs) that reflects cardiovascular dynamics and
can serve as a proxy for latent physiological changes. We propose UNIPHY+Lab, a
framework that combines a large-scale PPG foundation model for local waveform
encoding with a patient-aware Mamba model for long-range temporal modeling. Our
architecture addresses three challenges: (1) capturing extended temporal trends
in laboratory values, (2) accounting for patient-specific baseline variation
via FiLM-modulated initial states, and (3) performing multi-task estimation for
interrelated biomarkers. We evaluate our method on the two ICU datasets for
predicting the five key laboratory tests. The results show substantial
improvements over the LSTM and carry-forward baselines in MAE, RMSE, and $R^2$
among most of the estimation targets. This work demonstrates the feasibility of
continuous, personalized lab value estimation from routine PPG monitoring,
offering a pathway toward non-invasive biochemical surveillance in critical
care.

incorporates learnable rule embeddings in a decoder, a piecewise linear
quantile projection for numerical features, and feature masking ensembles for
robustness and uncertainty estimation. Evaluated on eight benchmark datasets,
RuleNet matches or surpasses state-of-the-art tree-based methods in most cases,

Motivation: 治疗性抗体候选物通常需要大量工程化改进功能特性，但现有方法很少利用结构数据，因为优化过程中不断演变的先导分子缺乏结构数据。

Result: 通过多个计算机和体外实验评估，证明该方法在抗体优化活动的多个阶段都能产生高亲和力结合物。

Conclusion: 该方法成功地将序列和结构信息与实验测量相结合，为抗体优化提供了一种有效的迭代设计策略。

Abstract: Therapeutic antibody candidates often require extensive engineering to
improve key functional and developability properties before clinical
development. This can be achieved through iterative design, where starting
molecules are optimized over several rounds of in vitro experiments. While
protein structure can provide a strong inductive bias, it is rarely used in
iterative design due to the lack of structural data for continually evolving
lead molecules over the course of optimization. In this work, we propose a
strategy for iterative antibody optimization that leverages both sequence and
structure as well as accumulating lab measurements of binding and
developability. Building on prior work, we first train a sequence-structure
diffusion generative model that operates on antibody-antigen complexes. We then
outline an approach to use this model, together with carefully predicted
antibody-antigen complexes, to optimize lead candidates throughout the
iterative design process. Further, we describe a guided sampling approach that
biases generation toward desirable properties by integrating models trained on
experimental data from iterative design. We evaluate our approach in multiple
in silico and in vitro experiments, demonstrating that it produces
high-affinity binders at multiple stages of an active antibody optimization
campaign.

Motivation: 解决神经网络表示中高维概率度量的表示问题，替代启发式全局池化操作，更准确地捕捉分布信息

Conclusion: EMPEROR是一个数学严谨、计算高效的框架，能够有效表示高维概率分布，在各种数据模态中具有广泛应用前景

Abstract: We introduce EMPEROR (Efficient Moment-Preserving Representation of
Distributions), a mathematically rigorous and computationally efficient
framework for representing high-dimensional probability measures arising in
neural network representations. Unlike heuristic global pooling operations,
EMPEROR encodes a feature distribution through its statistical moments. Our
approach leverages the theory of sliced moments: features are projected onto
multiple directions, lightweight univariate Gaussian mixture models (GMMs) are
fit to each projection, and the resulting slice parameters are aggregated into
a compact descriptor. We establish determinacy guarantees via Carleman's
condition and the Cram\'er-Wold theorem, ensuring that the GMM is uniquely
determined by its sliced moments, and we derive finite-sample error bounds that
scale optimally with the number of slices and samples. Empirically, EMPEROR
captures richer distributional information than common pooling schemes across
various data modalities, while remaining computationally efficient and broadly
applicable.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于标签操作或模型权重扰动的机器遗忘方法效果有限，需要更有效的方法来移除特定"遗忘"数据的影响，同时保留对"保留"数据的知识。

Method: CoUn框架通过对比学习利用数据样本间的语义相似性间接调整遗忘数据表示，并通过监督学习保持保留数据在其各自聚类中的表示。该方法仅应用于保留数据。

Result: 在多种数据集和模型架构上的广泛实验表明，CoUn在遗忘效果上持续优于最先进的机器遗忘基线方法。

Conclusion: CoUn通过模拟重新训练模型的行为，有效提升了机器遗忘的效果，且其对比学习模块可以增强现有基线的遗忘能力。

Abstract: Machine unlearning (MU) aims to remove the influence of specific "forget"
data from a trained model while preserving its knowledge of the remaining
"retain" data. Existing MU methods based on label manipulation or model weight
perturbations often achieve limited unlearning effectiveness. To address this,
we introduce CoUn, a novel MU framework inspired by the observation that a
model retrained from scratch using only retain data classifies forget data
based on their semantic similarity to the retain data. CoUn emulates this
behavior by adjusting learned data representations through contrastive learning
(CL) and supervised learning, applied exclusively to retain data. Specifically,
CoUn (1) leverages semantic similarity between data samples to indirectly
adjust forget representations using CL, and (2) maintains retain
representations within their respective clusters through supervised learning.
Extensive experiments across various datasets and model architectures show that
CoUn consistently outperforms state-of-the-art MU baselines in unlearning
effectiveness. Additionally, integrating our CL module into existing baselines
empowers their unlearning effectiveness.

Abstract: This paper studies Federated Learning (FL) for binary classification of
volatile financial market trends. Using a shared Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
classifier, we compare three scenarios: (i) a centralized model trained on the
union of all data, (ii) a single-agent model trained on an individual data
subset, and (iii) a privacy-preserving FL collaboration in which agents
exchange only model updates, never raw data. We then extend the study with
additional market features, deliberately introducing not independent and
identically distributed data (non-IID) across agents, personalized FL and
employing differential privacy. Our numerical experiments show that FL achieves
accuracy and generalization on par with the centralized baseline, while
significantly outperforming the single-agent model. The results show that
collaborative, privacy-preserving learning provides collective tangible value
in finance, even under realistic data heterogeneity and personalization
requirements.

Conclusion: GRID框架整合约束基方法、神经架构和领域特定语言模型提示，解决了建筑分析中的观察-因果差距

Abstract: Manual HVAC fault diagnosis in commercial buildings takes 8-12 hours per
incident and achieves only 60 percent diagnostic accuracy, reflecting analytics
that stop at correlation instead of causation. To close this gap, we present
GRID (Graph-based Reasoning for Intervention and Discovery), a three-stage
causal discovery pipeline that combines constraint-based search, neural
structural equation modeling, and language model priors to recover directed
acyclic graphs from building sensor data. Across six benchmarks: synthetic
rooms, EnergyPlus simulation, the ASHRAE Great Energy Predictor III dataset,
and a live office testbed, GRID achieves F1 scores ranging from 0.65 to 1.00,
with exact recovery (F1 = 1.00) in three controlled environments (Base, Hidden,
Physical) and strong performance on real-world data (F1 = 0.89 on ASHRAE, 0.86
in noisy conditions). The method outperforms ten baseline approaches across all
evaluation scenarios. Intervention scheduling achieves low operational impact
in most scenarios (cost <= 0.026) while reducing risk metrics compared to
baseline approaches. The framework integrates constraint-based methods, neural
architectures, and domain-specific language model prompts to address the
observational-causal gap in building analytics.

Motivation: 条件扩散模型似乎具有组合泛化能力，但这一能力的机制尚不清楚。本文旨在探究模型在生成超出训练分布的条件组合时的表现，并研究局部性作为组合泛化的结构机制。

Method: 在受控的CLEVR设置中研究长度泛化能力，提出条件投影组合与局部条件分数之间的等价关系，并通过因果干预验证理论。

Result: 研究发现成功的长度泛化模型表现出局部条件分数特征，而失败的模型则没有。通过强制局部条件分数的因果干预可以恢复失败模型的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 局部条件分数是条件扩散模型组合泛化的关键机制，这一发现为理解模型组合能力提供了理论依据和实证支持。

Abstract: Conditional diffusion models appear capable of compositional generalization,
i.e., generating convincing samples for out-of-distribution combinations of
conditioners, but the mechanisms underlying this ability remain unclear. To
make this concrete, we study length generalization, the ability to generate
images with more objects than seen during training. In a controlled CLEVR
setting (Johnson et al., 2017), we find that length generalization is
achievable in some cases but not others, suggesting that models only sometimes
learn the underlying compositional structure. We then investigate locality as a
structural mechanism for compositional generalization. Prior works proposed
score locality as a mechanism for creativity in unconditional diffusion models
(Kamb & Ganguli, 2024; Niedoba et al., 2024), but did not address flexible
conditioning or compositional generalization. In this paper, we prove an exact
equivalence between a specific compositional structure ("conditional projective
composition") (Bradley et al., 2025) and scores with sparse dependencies on
both pixels and conditioners ("local conditional scores"). This theory also
extends to feature-space compositionality. We validate our theory empirically:
CLEVR models that succeed at length generalization exhibit local conditional
scores, while those that fail do not. Furthermore, we show that a causal
intervention explicitly enforcing local conditional scores restores length
generalization in a previously failing model. Finally, we investigate
feature-space compositionality in color-conditioned CLEVR, and find preliminary
evidence of compositional structure in SDXL.

Conclusion: 本文为基于熵的多变量因果推断建立了理论基础，并提供了有效的算法实现，扩展了熵方法在因果发现中的应用范围。

Abstract: Entropic causal inference is a recent framework for learning the causal graph
between two variables from observational data by finding the
information-theoretically simplest structural explanation of the data, i.e.,
the model with smallest entropy. In our work, we first extend the causal graph
identifiability result in the two-variable setting under relaxed assumptions.
We then show the first identifiability result using the entropic approach for
learning causal graphs with more than two nodes. Our approach utilizes the
property that ancestrality between a source node and its descendants can be
determined using the bivariate entropic tests. We provide a sound sequential
peeling algorithm for general graphs that relies on this property. We also
propose a heuristic algorithm for small graphs that shows strong empirical
performance. We rigorously evaluate the performance of our algorithms on
synthetic data generated from a variety of models, observing improvement over
prior work. Finally we test our algorithms on real-world datasets.

Result: 广泛的实验表明，该框架有效平衡了公平性和实用性

Conclusion: 为高风险应用中的去偏问题提供了一个可扩展且实用的解决方案

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved promising results in tabular data
generation. However, inherent historical biases in tabular datasets often cause
LLMs to exacerbate fairness issues, particularly when multiple advantaged and
protected features are involved. In this work, we introduce a universal
debiasing framework that minimizes group-level dependencies by simultaneously
reducing the mutual information between advantaged and protected attributes. By
leveraging the autoregressive structure and analytic sampling distributions of
LLM-based tabular data generators, our approach efficiently computes mutual
information, reducing the need for cumbersome numerical estimations. Building
on this foundation, we propose two complementary methods: a direct preference
optimization (DPO)-based strategy, namely UDF-DPO, that integrates seamlessly
with existing models, and a targeted debiasing technique, namely UDF-MIX, that
achieves debiasing without tuning the parameters of LLMs. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our framework effectively balances fairness and utility,
offering a scalable and practical solution for debiasing in high-stakes
applications.

Abstract: We revisit the longstanding question of how physical structures in urban
landscapes influence crime. Leveraging machine learning-based matching
techniques to control for demographic composition, we estimate the effects of
several types of urban structures on the incidence of violent crime in New York
City and Chicago. We additionally contribute to a growing body of literature
documenting the relationship between perception of crime and actual crime rates
by separately analyzing how the physical urban landscape shapes subjective
feelings of safety. Our results are twofold. First, in consensus with prior
work, we demonstrate a "broken windows" effect in which abandoned buildings, a
sign of social disorder, are associated with both greater incidence of crime
and a heightened perception of danger. This is also true of types of urban
structures that draw foot traffic such as public transportation infrastructure.
Second, these effects are not uniform within or across cities. The criminogenic
effects of the same structure types across two cities differ in magnitude,
degree of spatial localization, and heterogeneity across subgroups, while
within the same city, the effects of different structure types are confounded
by different demographic variables. Taken together, these results emphasize
that one-size-fits-all approaches to crime reduction are untenable and policy
interventions must be specifically tailored to their targets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于生理数据（如PPG信号）预训练的基础模型被广泛用于改善心率预测，但微调这些模型对人口统计公平性的影响，特别是在领域偏移下的影响尚未得到充分研究。

Method: 研究在三个异构数据集（ICU、可穿戴设备、智能手机）上微调了PPG-GPT基础模型，并系统评估了微调对心率预测准确性和性别公平性的影响。提出了FairTune框架，比较了三种缓解策略：基于逆组频率的类别加权、组分布鲁棒优化和对抗性去偏。

Result: 微调显著降低了平均绝对误差（最高达80%），但同时也扩大了公平性差距。IF和GroupDRO策略能显著减少公平性差距而不损害准确性，其效果因部署领域而异。表示分析显示缓解技术重塑了内部嵌入以减少人口统计聚类。

Conclusion: 公平性不会作为微调的自然副产品出现，明确的缓解措施对于生理基础模型的公平部署至关重要。

Abstract: Foundation models pretrained on physiological data such as
photoplethysmography (PPG) signals are increasingly used to improve heart rate
(HR) prediction across diverse settings. Fine-tuning these models for local
deployment is often seen as a practical and scalable strategy. However, its
impact on demographic fairness particularly under domain shifts remains
underexplored. We fine-tune PPG-GPT a transformer-based foundation model
pretrained on intensive care unit (ICU) data across three heterogeneous
datasets (ICU, wearable, smartphone) and systematically evaluate the effects on
HR prediction accuracy and gender fairness. While fine-tuning substantially
reduces mean absolute error (up to 80%), it can simultaneously widen fairness
gaps, especially in larger models and under significant distributional
characteristics shifts. To address this, we introduce FairTune, a bias-aware
fine-tuning framework in which we benchmark three mitigation strategies: class
weighting based on inverse group frequency (IF), Group Distributionally Robust
Optimization (GroupDRO), and adversarial debiasing (ADV). We find that IF and
GroupDRO significantly reduce fairness gaps without compromising accuracy, with
effectiveness varying by deployment domain. Representation analyses further
reveal that mitigation techniques reshape internal embeddings to reduce
demographic clustering. Our findings highlight that fairness does not emerge as
a natural byproduct of fine-tuning and that explicit mitigation is essential
for equitable deployment of physiological foundation models.

Conclusion: 熵的下降是模型崩溃的直接驱动因素，基于熵的数据选择策略是缓解扩散模型崩溃的有效方法。

Abstract: The widespread use of diffusion models has led to an abundance of
AI-generated data, raising concerns about model collapse -- a phenomenon in
which recursive iterations of training on synthetic data lead to performance
degradation. Prior work primarily characterizes this collapse via variance
shrinkage or distribution shift, but these perspectives miss practical
manifestations of model collapse. This paper identifies a transition from
generalization to memorization during model collapse in diffusion models, where
models increasingly replicate training data instead of generating novel content
during iterative training on synthetic samples. This transition is directly
driven by the declining entropy of the synthetic training data produced in each
training cycle, which serves as a clear indicator of model degradation.
Motivated by this insight, we propose an entropy-based data selection strategy
to mitigate the transition from generalization to memorization and alleviate
model collapse. Empirical results show that our approach significantly enhances
visual quality and diversity in recursive generation, effectively preventing
collapse.

Conclusion: 该框架无需预定义实体，直接使用LLM输出作为隐式反馈优化检索器，特别适用于开放域设置，证明了图检索器与LLM端到端联合训练的优势。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has significantly mitigated the
hallucinations of Large Language Models (LLMs) by grounding the generation with
external knowledge. Recent extensions of RAG to graph-based retrieval offer a
promising direction, leveraging the structural knowledge for multi-hop
reasoning. However, existing graph RAG typically decouples retrieval and
reasoning processes, which prevents the retriever from adapting to the
reasoning needs of the LLM. They also struggle with scalability when performing
multi-hop expansion over large-scale graphs, or depend heavily on annotated
ground-truth entities, which are often unavailable in open-domain settings. To
address these challenges, we propose a novel graph retriever trained end-to-end
with LLM, which features an attention-based growing and pruning mechanism,
adaptively navigating multi-hop relevant entities while filtering out noise.
Within the extracted subgraph, structural knowledge and semantic features are
encoded via soft tokens and the verbalized graph, respectively, which are
infused into the LLM together, thereby enhancing its reasoning capability and
facilitating interactive joint training of the graph retriever and the LLM
reasoner. Experimental results across three QA benchmarks show that our
approach consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance, validating the
strength of joint graph-LLM optimization for complex reasoning tasks. Notably,
our framework eliminates the need for predefined ground-truth entities by
directly optimizing the retriever using LLM logits as implicit feedback, making
it especially effective in open-domain settings.

Motivation: 受GDPR和CCPA等隐私法规赋予用户"被遗忘权"的推动，需要开发能够有效删除特定用户数据的机器学习方法。

Method: 结合分层数据驱动的重要性评分方案和师生蒸馏方法，通过重要性加权损失函数实现针对性遗忘，同时保留常见模式。

Result: 在三个真实世界高阶移动数据集上的实验表明，TraceHiding在遗忘准确性、成员推理攻击抵抗性方面表现优异，相比重新训练速度提升高达40倍，且测试精度损失最小。

Conclusion: 这是首个针对轨迹数据的系统性机器学习遗忘研究，提供了可复现的流程和公开代码，展示了在不同模型上的鲁棒性和一致性性能。

Abstract: This work introduces TraceHiding, a scalable, importance-aware machine
unlearning framework for mobility trajectory data. Motivated by privacy
regulations such as GDPR and CCPA granting users "the right to be forgotten,"
TraceHiding removes specified user trajectories from trained deep models
without full retraining. It combines a hierarchical data-driven importance
scoring scheme with teacher-student distillation. Importance scores--computed
at token, trajectory, and user levels from statistical properties (coverage
diversity, entropy, length)--quantify each training sample's impact, enabling
targeted forgetting of high-impact data while preserving common patterns. The
student model retains knowledge on remaining data and unlearns targeted
trajectories through an importance-weighted loss that amplifies forgetting
signals for unique samples and attenuates them for frequent ones. We validate
on Trajectory--User Linking (TUL) tasks across three real-world higher-order
mobility datasets (HO-Rome, HO-Geolife, HO-NYC) and multiple architectures
(GRU, LSTM, BERT, ModernBERT, GCN-TULHOR), against strong unlearning baselines
including SCRUB, NegGrad, NegGrad+, Bad-T, and Finetuning. Experiments under
uniform and targeted user deletion show TraceHiding, especially its
entropy-based variant, achieves superior unlearning accuracy, competitive
membership inference attack (MIA) resilience, and up to 40\times speedup over
retraining with minimal test accuracy loss. Results highlight robustness to
adversarial deletion of high-information users and consistent performance
across models. To our knowledge, this is the first systematic study of machine
unlearning for trajectory data, providing a reproducible pipeline with public
code and preprocessing tools.

Conclusion: 该方法为边缘设备提供了高效、隐私保护且产品级的RAG训练解决方案，解决了资源约束下的模型更新难题。

Abstract: When existing retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) solutions are intended to
be used for new knowledge domains, it is necessary to update their encoders,
which are taken to be pretrained large language models (LLMs). However, fully
finetuning these large models is compute- and memory-intensive, and even
infeasible when deployed on resource-constrained edge devices. We propose a
novel encoder architecture in this work that addresses this limitation by using
a frozen small language model (SLM), which satisfies the memory constraints of
edge devices, and inserting a small adapter network before the transformer
blocks of the SLM. The trainable adapter takes the token embeddings of the new
corpus and learns to produce enhanced soft embeddings for it, while requiring
significantly less compute power to update than full fine-tuning. We further
propose a novel retrieval mechanism by attaching a classifier head to the SLM
encoder, which is trained to learn a similarity mapping of the input embeddings
to their corresponding documents. Finally, to enable the online fine-tuning of
both (i) the encoder soft embeddings and (ii) the classifier-as-retriever on
edge devices, we adopt federated learning (FL) and differential privacy (DP) to
achieve an efficient, privacy-preserving, and product-grade training solution.
We conduct a theoretical analysis of our methodology, establishing convergence
guarantees under mild assumptions on gradient variance when deployed for
general smooth nonconvex loss functions. Through extensive numerical
experiments, we demonstrate (i) the efficacy of obtaining soft embeddings to
enhance the encoder, (ii) training a classifier to improve the retriever, and
(iii) the role of FL in achieving speedup.

Motivation: 传统半监督学习方法在大量未标记数据场景下性能有限，需要探索如何有效利用LLM的知识来提升模型性能。

Method: 使用LLM对未标记数据生成标签作为目标，两个编码器网络通过记录对LLM标签置信度的历史估计，动态计算样本重要性权重，并相互交换权重进行训练。

Result: 在5个基准数据集中的4个上达到最先进性能，在14种对比方法中排名第一（Friedman测试）。

Conclusion: 该方法展示了LLM作为知识放大器的新方向，使骨干协同训练模型能够高效实现最先进性能。

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel weighted co-training approach that is
guided by Large Language Models (LLMs). Namely, in our co-training approach, we
use LLM labels on unlabeled data as target labels and co-train two encoder-only
based networks that train each other over multiple iterations: first, all
samples are forwarded through each network and historical estimates of each
network's confidence in the LLM label are recorded; second, a dynamic
importance weight is derived for each sample according to each network's belief
in the quality of the LLM label for that sample; finally, the two networks
exchange importance weights with each other -- each network back-propagates all
samples weighted with the importance weights coming from its peer network and
updates its own parameters. By strategically utilizing LLM-generated guidance,
our approach significantly outperforms conventional SSL methods, particularly
in settings with abundant unlabeled data. Empirical results show that it
achieves state-of-the-art performance on 4 out of 5 benchmark datasets and
ranks first among 14 compared methods according to the Friedman test. Our
results highlight a new direction in semi-supervised learning -- where LLMs
serve as knowledge amplifiers, enabling backbone co-training models to achieve
state-of-the-art performance efficiently.

TL;DR: 本文首次系统比较了数据同化(DA)和基于似然推断(LBI)在基于代理模型(ABMs)中的应用。研究发现LBI在代理级别状态估计方面表现更好，而DA在聚合预测方面保持竞争力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基于代理模型(ABMs)生成由演化的部分潜在微观状态驱动的可观测时间序列。需要估计潜在状态以使模拟与现实世界数据对齐，传统上通过DA解决，但ABMs的特性对标准DA方法构成挑战。

Method: 在著名的意见动态ABM——有界置信模型上比较DA和LBI两种方法。DA以模型无关的方式近似似然函数，而LBI直接利用模型的似然函数进行更准确的状态估计。

Result: LBI能更好地恢复潜在代理级别的意见，即使在模型误设情况下也能改进个体级别预测。在聚合级别，两种方法表现相当，DA在某些参数设置下在各级聚合中保持竞争力。

Conclusion: DA适用于聚合预测，而LBI更适合代理级别推断，两种方法在不同应用场景下各有优势。

Abstract: In this paper, we present the first systematic comparison of Data
Assimilation (DA) and Likelihood-Based Inference (LBI) in the context of
Agent-Based Models (ABMs). These models generate observable time series driven
by evolving, partially-latent microstates. Latent states need to be estimated
to align simulations with real-world data -- a task traditionally addressed by
DA, especially in continuous and equation-based models such as those used in
weather forecasting. However, the nature of ABMs poses challenges for standard
DA methods. Solving such issues requires adaptation of previous DA techniques,
or ad-hoc alternatives such as LBI. DA approximates the likelihood in a
model-agnostic way, making it broadly applicable but potentially less precise.
In contrast, LBI provides more accurate state estimation by directly leveraging
the model's likelihood, but at the cost of requiring a hand-crafted,
model-specific likelihood function, which may be complex or infeasible to
derive. We compare the two methods on the Bounded-Confidence Model, a
well-known opinion dynamics ABM, where agents are affected only by others
holding sufficiently similar opinions. We find that LBI better recovers latent
agent-level opinions, even under model mis-specification, leading to improved
individual-level forecasts. At the aggregate level, however, both methods
perform comparably, and DA remains competitive across levels of aggregation
under certain parameter settings. Our findings suggest that DA is well-suited
for aggregate predictions, while LBI is preferable for agent-level inference.

Motivation: 尽管关于大型语言模型偏见的研究日益增多，但大多数工作集中在性别和种族上，对宗教身份的关注很少。本文旨在探索宗教在LLMs中如何内部表征，以及如何与暴力和地理概念相交。

Method: 使用机制解释性和稀疏自编码器（通过Neuronpedia API），分析五个模型中潜在特征激活，测量宗教相关和暴力相关提示之间的重叠，并探测激活上下文中的语义模式。

Result: 所有五种宗教显示出相当的内部凝聚力，但伊斯兰教更频繁地与暴力语言相关特征关联。相比之下，地理关联主要反映现实世界的宗教人口分布。

Conclusion: 这些发现凸显了结构分析在审计模型输出以及塑造模型行为的内部表征方面的价值，揭示了模型如何嵌入事实分布和文化刻板印象。

Abstract: Despite growing research on bias in large language models (LLMs), most work
has focused on gender and race, with little attention to religious identity.
This paper explores how religion is internally represented in LLMs and how it
intersects with concepts of violence and geography. Using mechanistic
interpretability and Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) via the Neuronpedia API, we
analyze latent feature activations across five models. We measure overlap
between religion- and violence-related prompts and probe semantic patterns in
activation contexts. While all five religions show comparable internal
cohesion, Islam is more frequently linked to features associated with violent
language. In contrast, geographic associations largely reflect real-world
religious demographics, revealing how models embed both factual distributions
and cultural stereotypes. These findings highlight the value of structural
analysis in auditing not just outputs but also internal representations that
shape model behavior.

Motivation: 过程奖励模型需要细粒度、步骤级评估来促进大语言模型的深度推理，但人工标注成本高且难以扩展。蒙特卡洛估计的合成数据存在高噪声比问题，导致过拟合和训练困难。

Method: 提出自去噪蒙特卡洛标注框架，分析MC估计中的噪声分布特征，利用轻量级模型通过自去噪策略生成高质量标注，结合噪声容忍学习策略训练PRMs。

Result: 仅需原始MC估计6%的推理成本，在ProcessBench上F1分数从19.9提升至59.1，超越基于大规模人工标注数据集PRM800K的基线模型，且性能随合成数据规模扩大持续提升。

Conclusion: SCAN框架为可扩展、成本效益高且鲁棒的PRM训练提供了有效解决方案，证明了轻量级模型通过自去噪策略能够产生高质量标注的潜力。

Abstract: Process reward models (PRMs) offer fine-grained, step-level evaluations that
facilitate deeper reasoning processes in large language models (LLMs), proving
effective in complex tasks like mathematical reasoning. However, developing
PRMs is challenging due to the high cost and limited scalability of
human-annotated data. Synthetic data from Monte Carlo (MC) estimation is a
promising alternative but suffers from a high noise ratio, which can cause
overfitting and hinder large-scale training. In this work, we conduct a
preliminary study on the noise distribution in synthetic data from MC
estimation, identifying that annotation models tend to both underestimate and
overestimate step correctness due to limitations in their annotation
capabilities. Building on these insights, we propose Self-Denoising Monte Carlo
Annotation (SCAN), an efficient data synthesis and noise-tolerant learning
framework. Our key findings indicate that: (1) Even lightweight models (e.g.,
1.5B parameters) can produce high-quality annotations through a self-denoising
strategy, enabling PRMs to achieve superior performance with only 6% the
inference cost required by vanilla MC estimation. (2) With our robust learning
strategy, PRMs can effectively learn from this weak supervision, achieving a
39.2 F1 score improvement (from 19.9 to 59.1) in ProcessBench. Despite using
only a compact synthetic dataset, our models surpass strong baselines,
including those trained on large-scale human-annotated datasets such as
PRM800K. Furthermore, performance continues to improve as we scale up the
synthetic data, highlighting the potential of SCAN for scalable,
cost-efficient, and robust PRM training.

Motivation: 现有的ViT自编码器往往未能充分利用全局Class token，且采用静态注意力机制，限制了生成控制和优化效率。

Method: 将Class token映射为全局潜变量来指导局部潜变量的先验分布；基于意见动力学将每个注意力头视为寻求共识的动态系统；使用收敛感知的温度调度器自适应调整注意力头的影响函数；实施基于理论诊断的头部冻结机制。

Result: 该方法在训练过程中修剪已收敛的注意力头，显著提高了计算效率而不牺牲保真度。

Conclusion: ViTCAE通过统一生成性Class token和基于多智能体共识理论的自适应注意力机制，为基于Transformer的生成提供了更高效和可控的方法。

Abstract: Vision Transformer (ViT) based autoencoders often underutilize the global
Class token and employ static attention mechanisms, limiting both generative
control and optimization efficiency. This paper introduces ViTCAE, a framework
that addresses these issues by re-purposing the Class token into a generative
linchpin. In our architecture, the encoder maps the Class token to a global
latent variable that dictates the prior distribution for local, patch-level
latent variables, establishing a robust dependency where global semantics
directly inform the synthesis of local details. Drawing inspiration from
opinion dynamics, we treat each attention head as a dynamical system of
interacting tokens seeking consensus. This perspective motivates a
convergence-aware temperature scheduler that adaptively anneals each head's
influence function based on its distributional stability. This process enables
a principled head-freezing mechanism, guided by theoretically-grounded
diagnostics like an attention evolution distance and a consensus/cluster
functional. This technique prunes converged heads during training to
significantly improve computational efficiency without sacrificing fidelity. By
unifying a generative Class token with an adaptive attention mechanism rooted
in multi-agent consensus theory, ViTCAE offers a more efficient and
controllable approach to transformer-based generation.

Conclusion: 基于学习的设计在FEEL中具有巨大潜力，能够显著提升低SNR条件下的性能表现。

Abstract: Federated edge learning (FEEL) enables distributed model training across
wireless devices without centralising raw data, but deployment is constrained
by the wireless uplink. A promising direction is over-the-air (OTA)
aggregation, which merges communication with computation. Existing digital OTA
methods can achieve either strong convergence or robustness to noise, but
struggle to achieve both simultaneously, limiting performance in low
signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) where many IoT devices operate. This work
proposes a learnt digital OTA framework that extends reliable operation into
low-SNR conditions while maintaining the same uplink overhead as
state-of-the-art. The proposed method combines an unrolled decoder with a
jointly learnt unsourced random access codebook. Results show an extension of
reliable operation by more than 7 dB, with improved global model convergence
across all SNR levels, highlighting the potential of learning-based design for
FEEL.

*Yukuan Wei,Xudong Li,Lin F. Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文研究了约束平均奖励MDP（CAMDP）的样本复杂度，提出了一个模型化算法，在松弛可行性和严格可行性两种设置下分别达到最优样本复杂度，并建立了匹配的下界。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然平均奖励MDP（AMDP）的样本复杂度已有显著进展，但对约束平均奖励MDP（CAMDP）的研究相对较少，本文旨在填补这一理论空白。

Method: 提出一个模型化算法，在两种设置下运行：松弛可行性（允许小约束违反）和严格可行性（输出策略必须满足约束）。

Result: 算法在松弛可行性下达到样本复杂度$\tilde{O}\left(\frac{S A (B+H)}{ \epsilon^2}\right)$，在严格可行性下达到$\tilde{O}\left(\frac{S A (B+H)}{\epsilon^2 \zeta^2} \right)$，并建立了匹配的下界$\tilde{\Omega}\left(\frac{S A (B+H)}{ \epsilon^2\zeta^2}\right)$。

Conclusion: 本文首次为CAMDP提供了极小极大最优边界，填补了约束平均奖励MDP复杂度理解的理论空白。

Abstract: Recent advances have significantly improved our understanding of the sample
complexity of learning in average-reward Markov decision processes (AMDPs)
under the generative model. However, much less is known about the constrained
average-reward MDP (CAMDP), where policies must satisfy long-run average
constraints. In this work, we address this gap by studying the sample
complexity of learning an $\epsilon$-optimal policy in CAMDPs under a
generative model. We propose a model-based algorithm that operates under two
settings: (i) relaxed feasibility, which allows small constraint violations,
and (ii) strict feasibility, where the output policy satisfies the constraint.
We show that our algorithm achieves sample complexities of
$\tilde{O}\left(\frac{S A (B+H)}{ \epsilon^2}\right)$ and $\tilde{O}
\left(\frac{S A (B+H)}{\epsilon^2 \zeta^2} \right)$ under the relaxed and
strict feasibility settings, respectively. Here, $\zeta$ is the Slater constant
indicating the size of the feasible region, $H$ is the span bound of the bias
function, and $B$ is the transient time bound. Moreover, a matching lower bound
of $\tilde{\Omega}\left(\frac{S A (B+H)}{ \epsilon^2\zeta^2}\right)$ for the
strict feasibility case is established, thus providing the first
minimax-optimal bounds for CAMDPs. Our results close the theoretical gap in
understanding the complexity of constrained average-reward MDPs.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GraphIDS是一个自监督的网络入侵检测模型，通过图神经网络和掩码自编码器统一表示学习和异常检测，在NetFlow基准测试中达到99.98% PR-AUC和99.61% F1分数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于图神经网络的入侵检测方法通常将表示学习和异常检测解耦，限制了嵌入向量在识别攻击中的效用。

Method: 使用归纳图神经网络嵌入每个流量的局部拓扑上下文，通过基于Transformer的编码器-解码器重建这些嵌入，在推理时通过高重建误差标记潜在入侵。

Result: 在多样化NetFlow基准测试中，GraphIDS实现了高达99.98% PR-AUC和99.61%宏F1分数，比基线方法提升5-25个百分点。

Conclusion: 该端到端框架确保嵌入直接针对下游任务进行优化，有助于识别恶意流量，在有限监督和不断演变的攻击模式下表现优异。

Abstract: Detecting intrusions in network traffic is a challenging task, particularly
under limited supervision and constantly evolving attack patterns. While recent
works have leveraged graph neural networks for network intrusion detection,
they often decouple representation learning from anomaly detection, limiting
the utility of the embeddings for identifying attacks. We propose GraphIDS, a
self-supervised intrusion detection model that unifies these two stages by
learning local graph representations of normal communication patterns through a
masked autoencoder. An inductive graph neural network embeds each flow with its
local topological context to capture typical network behavior, while a
Transformer-based encoder-decoder reconstructs these embeddings, implicitly
learning global co-occurrence patterns via self-attention without requiring
explicit positional information. During inference, flows with unusually high
reconstruction errors are flagged as potential intrusions. This end-to-end
framework ensures that embeddings are directly optimized for the downstream
task, facilitating the recognition of malicious traffic. On diverse NetFlow
benchmarks, GraphIDS achieves up to 99.98% PR-AUC and 99.61% macro F1-score,
outperforming baselines by 5-25 percentage points.

TL;DR: CAPE是一种新的位置编码方法，针对非顺序但因果相关的特征数据，通过识别因果结构并嵌入双曲空间来生成因果感知的位置编码。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有位置编码方法需要预定义的token/特征顺序，不适用于具有非顺序但因果相关特征的真实世界数据。

Method: 使用广义结构方程建模识别非顺序特征的因果结构作为加权有向无环图，在双曲空间中嵌入该图以保留几何结构，生成因果感知的位置编码并转换为旋转形式。

Result: 理论分析显示CAPE生成的旋转位置编码具有因果距离诱导衰减、因果一般性诱导衰减和对位置干扰的鲁棒性三个有价值特性。在合成和真实数据集上的实验验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: CAPE能够有效增强transformer在处理非顺序特征数据时的性能，为这类数据提供了合适的位置编码解决方案。

Abstract: Positional encoding is essential for supplementing transformer with
positional information of tokens. Existing positional encoding methods demand
predefined token/feature order, rendering them unsuitable for real-world data
with non-sequential yet causally-related features. To address this limitation,
we propose CAPE, a novel method that identifies underlying causal structure
over non-sequential features as a weighted directed acyclic graph (DAG) using
generalized structural equation modeling. The DAG is then embedded in
hyperbolic space where its geometric structure is well-preserved using a
hyperboloid model-based approach that effectively captures two important causal
graph properties (causal strength & causal specificity). This step yields
causality-aware positional encodings for the features, which are converted into
their rotary form for integrating with transformer's self-attention mechanism.
Theoretical analysis reveals that CAPE-generated rotary positional encodings
possess three valuable properties for enhanced self-attention, including causal
distance-induced attenuation, causal generality-induced attenuation, and
robustness to positional disturbances. We evaluate CAPE over both synthetic and
real-word datasets, empirically demonstrating its theoretical properties and
effectiveness in enhancing transformer for data with non-sequential features.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种λ-正交性正则化方法，在保持原始表示结构的同时实现分布特定的适配，解决了不同神经网络表示之间的兼容性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于高训练成本和表示不一致性，需要促进不同神经网络表示之间的通信和兼容性。现有方法（仿射变换和正交变换）各有局限：仿射变换会显著改变原始表示，正交变换则适应性受限。

Method: 在仿射变换学习过程中施加松弛的正交性约束（λ-正交性正则化），既实现分布特定适配，又保留原始学习表示。

Result: 在多种架构和数据集上的实验验证表明，该方法能保持模型的零样本性能，并确保模型更新间的兼容性。

Conclusion: λ-正交性正则化方法有效平衡了表示适配的需求与原始结构保持的要求，为模型更新和表示兼容性提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Retrieval systems rely on representations learned by increasingly powerful
models. However, due to the high training cost and inconsistencies in learned
representations, there is significant interest in facilitating communication
between representations and ensuring compatibility across independently trained
neural networks. In the literature, two primary approaches are commonly used to
adapt different learned representations: affine transformations, which adapt
well to specific distributions but can significantly alter the original
representation, and orthogonal transformations, which preserve the original
structure with strict geometric constraints but limit adaptability. A key
challenge is adapting the latent spaces of updated models to align with those
of previous models on downstream distributions while preserving the newly
learned representation spaces. In this paper, we impose a relaxed orthogonality
constraint, namely $\lambda$-orthogonality regularization, while learning an
affine transformation, to obtain distribution-specific adaptation while
retaining the original learned representations. Extensive experiments across
various architectures and datasets validate our approach, demonstrating that it
preserves the model's zero-shot performance and ensures compatibility across
model updates. Code available at:

Conclusion: HypeMARL为高维参数化分布式系统的控制提供了一种有效的去中心化MARL解决方案，特别适用于需要智能体集体协作的PDE约束最优控制问题。

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning has recently emerged as a promising feedback
control strategy for complex dynamical systems governed by partial differential
equations (PDEs). When dealing with distributed, high-dimensional problems in
state and control variables, multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) has been
proposed as a scalable approach for breaking the curse of dimensionality. In
particular, through decentralized training and execution, multiple agents
cooperate to steer the system towards a target configuration, relying solely on
local state and reward information. However, the principle of locality may
become a limiting factor whenever a collective, nonlocal behavior of the agents
is crucial to maximize the reward function, as typically happens in
PDE-constrained optimal control problems. In this work, we propose HypeMARL: a
decentralized MARL algorithm tailored to the control of high-dimensional,
parametric, and distributed systems. HypeMARL employs hypernetworks to
effectively parametrize the agents' policies and value functions with respect
to the system parameters and the agents' relative positions, encoded by
sinusoidal positional encoding. Through the application on challenging control
problems, such as density and flow control, we show that HypeMARL (i) can
effectively control systems through a collective behavior of the agents,
outperforming state-of-the-art decentralized MARL, (ii) can efficiently deal
with parametric dependencies, (iii) requires minimal hyperparameter tuning and
(iv) can reduce the amount of expensive environment interactions by a factor of
~10 thanks to its model-based extension, MB-HypeMARL, which relies on
computationally efficient deep learning-based surrogate models approximating
the dynamics locally, with minimal deterioration of the policy performance.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种混合深度学习框架PCA-PR-Seq2Seq-Adam-LSTM，用于准确预测电力中断事件。该框架结合了主成分分析、泊松回归和序列到序列架构的Adam优化LSTM，在真实数据集上表现出优于现有方法的预测精度和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 电力中断预测受到天气、植被、野生动物和负荷波动等多种因素的复杂影响，这些因素在中断数据中引入了显著的变异性和噪声，使得可靠预测变得困难。需要开发能够有效处理非线性动态时间序列数据的预测方法。

Method: 提出的混合框架整合了PCA（用于降维和数据稳定性）、泊松回归（用于建模离散中断事件）以及Seq2Seq-Adam-LSTM（用于增强时间特征学习和长期依赖关系捕捉）。

Result: 使用密歇根州的真实中断记录进行评估，结果表明该方法在预测精度和鲁棒性方面显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: PCA-PR-Seq2Seq-Adam-LSTM框架为电力中断预测提供了一种有效的解决方案，能够处理复杂的时间序列数据并提高预测性能。

Abstract: Accurately forecasting power outages is a complex task influenced by diverse
factors such as weather conditions [1], vegetation, wildlife, and load
fluctuations. These factors introduce substantial variability and noise into
outage data, making reliable prediction challenging. Long Short-Term Memory
(LSTM) networks, a type of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), are particularly
effective for modeling nonlinear and dynamic time-series data, with proven
applications in stock price forecasting [2], energy demand prediction, demand
response [3], and traffic flow management [4]. This paper introduces a hybrid
deep learning framework, termed PCA-PR-Seq2Seq-Adam-LSTM, that integrates
Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Poisson Regression (PR), a
Sequence-to-Sequence (Seq2Seq) architecture, and an Adam-optimized LSTM. PCA is
employed to reduce dimensionality and stabilize data variance, while Poisson
Regression effectively models discrete outage events. The Seq2Seq-Adam-LSTM
component enhances temporal feature learning through efficient gradient
optimization and long-term dependency capture. The framework is evaluated using
real-world outage records from Michigan, and results indicate that the proposed
approach significantly improves forecasting accuracy and robustness compared to
existing methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管机器学习方法在医学领域的准确性不断提高，但缺乏透明度阻碍了其在临床实践中的采用。需要开发可解释的AI模型来增强临床医生的信任。

Method: 使用KANs作为基于函数的架构，提出Logistic-KAN（逻辑回归的灵活泛化）和Kolmogorov-Arnold加法模型（KAAM），提供透明的符号表示和内置的患者层面洞察。

Result: 在多个健康数据集上，这些模型匹配或优于标准基线方法，同时保持完全可解释性，支持直观可视化和最近患者检索。

Conclusion: KANs是迈向可信AI的有希望的一步，临床医生可以理解、审核并基于这些模型采取行动。

Abstract: Why should a clinician trust an Artificial Intelligence (AI) prediction?
Despite the increasing accuracy of machine learning methods in medicine, the
lack of transparency continues to hinder their adoption in clinical practice.
In this work, we explore Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) for clinical
classification tasks on tabular data. Unlike traditional neural networks, KANs
are function-based architectures that offer intrinsic interpretability through
transparent, symbolic representations. We introduce Logistic-KAN, a flexible
generalization of logistic regression, and Kolmogorov-Arnold Additive Model
(KAAM), a simplified additive variant that delivers transparent, symbolic
formulas. Unlike black-box models that require post-hoc explainability tools,
our models support built-in patient-level insights, intuitive visualizations,
and nearest-patient retrieval. Across multiple health datasets, our models
match or outperform standard baselines, while remaining fully interpretable.
These results position KANs as a promising step toward trustworthy AI that
clinicians can understand, audit, and act upon.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的离散扩散模型分析方法，消除了传统分析中所需的限制性假设，改进了τ-leaping采样器的收敛性保证，将词汇表大小的依赖从二次降低到线性，并为其他采样器提供了首个收敛保证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有离散扩散模型的理论分析依赖难以验证的规律性假设，且收敛边界对词汇表大小有二次依赖，限制了实际应用效果。

Method: 采用基于微分不等式的新分析技术，替代传统的Girsanov测度变换方法，提供更灵活的分析框架。

Result: 为标准τ-leaping方法建立了KL散度的收敛保证，词汇表大小依赖从二次改进为线性；首次为Euler方法和Tweedie τ-leaping提供了收敛保证。

Conclusion: 新分析方法不仅改进了现有采样器的理论保证，其微分不等式技术对其他随机过程分析也具有独立价值。

Abstract: Discrete diffusion models have recently gained significant prominence in
applications involving natural language and graph data. A key factor
influencing their effectiveness is the efficiency of discretized samplers.
Among these, $\tau$-leaping samplers have become particularly popular due to
their empirical success. However, existing theoretical analyses of
$\tau$-leaping often rely on somewhat restrictive and difficult-to-verify
regularity assumptions, and their convergence bounds contain quadratic
dependence on the vocabulary size. In this work, we introduce a new analytical
approach for discrete diffusion models that removes the need for such
assumptions. For the standard $\tau$-leaping method, we establish convergence
guarantees in KL divergence that scale linearly with vocabulary size, improving
upon prior results with quadratic dependence. Our approach is also more broadly
applicable: it provides the first convergence guarantees for other widely used
samplers, including the Euler method and Tweedie $\tau$-leaping. Central to our
approach is a novel technique based on differential inequalities, offering a
more flexible alternative to the traditional Girsanov change-of-measure
methods. This technique may also be of independent interest for the analysis of
other stochastic processes.

### [300] [Geometric Mixture Classifier (GMC): A Discriminative Per-Class Mixture of Hyperplanes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16769)
*Prasanth K K,Shubham Sharma*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了几何混合分类器（GMC），一种判别式模型，将每个类别表示为多个超平面的混合，通过温度控制的soft-OR组合平面得分，在保持可解释性的同时处理多模态数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的许多类别是多模态的，传统线性模型（如逻辑回归、线性SVM）在特征空间中用单个全局超平面无法有效处理此类数据，而高容量方法（如核SVM、深度网络）虽然能拟合多模态结构，但牺牲了可解释性、计算成本高且需要更多调参。

Method: GMC将每个类别表示为超平面混合，类内使用温度控制的soft-OR（log-sum-exp）平滑近似最大值操作，类间使用标准softmax生成概率后验。可选使用随机傅里叶特征（RFF）进行非线性映射，同时保持推理线性复杂度。训练方法包括几何感知k-means初始化、基于轮廓的平面预算、alpha退火、使用感知的L2正则化、标签平滑和早停。

Result: 在合成多模态数据集（moons、circles、blobs、spirals）和表格/图像基准（iris、wine、WDBC、digits）上，GMC一致优于线性基线和k-NN，与RBF-SVM、随机森林和小型MLP竞争，并提供几何可解释性。推理复杂度与平面数和特征数线性相关，CPU友好，每个示例微秒级延迟，通常比RBF-SVM和紧凑MLP更快。后处理温度缩放将ECE从约0.06降至0.02。

Conclusion: GMC在准确性、可解释性和效率之间取得了有利平衡：比线性模型更具表达力，比核方法或深度模型更轻量、更透明、更快。

Abstract: Many real world categories are multimodal, with single classes occupying
disjoint regions in feature space. Classical linear models (logistic
regression, linear SVM) use a single global hyperplane and perform poorly on
such data, while high-capacity methods (kernel SVMs, deep nets) fit multimodal
structure but at the expense of interpretability, heavier tuning, and higher
computational cost. We propose the Geometric Mixture Classifier (GMC), a
discriminative model that represents each class as a mixture of hyperplanes.
Within each class, GMC combines plane scores via a temperature-controlled
soft-OR (log-sum-exp), smoothly approximating the max; across classes, standard
softmax yields probabilistic posteriors. GMC optionally uses Random Fourier
Features (RFF) for nonlinear mappings while keeping inference linear in the
number of planes and features. Our practical training recipe: geometry-aware
k-means initialization, silhouette-based plane budgeting, alpha annealing,
usage-aware L2 regularization, label smoothing, and early stopping, makes GMC
plug-and-play. Across synthetic multimodal datasets (moons, circles, blobs,
spirals) and tabular/image benchmarks (iris, wine, WDBC, digits), GMC
consistently outperforms linear baselines and k-NN, is competitive with
RBF-SVM, Random Forests, and small MLPs, and provides geometric introspection
via per-plane and class responsibility visualizations. Inference scales
linearly in planes and features, making GMC CPU-friendly, with single-digit
microsecond latency per example, often faster than RBF-SVM and compact MLPs.
Post-hoc temperature scaling reduces ECE from about 0.06 to 0.02. GMC thus
strikes a favorable balance of accuracy, interpretability, and efficiency: it
is more expressive than linear models and lighter, more transparent, and faster
than kernel or deep models.

TL;DR: DISCO Steering是一种新的语言模型引导方法，通过在注意力头的查询和值表示空间中直接注入导向向量，实现了比传统方法更精细的控制和更好的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通常将导向向量添加到残差流或注意力头输出中，但作者发现查询和值表示空间具有更高的概念线性可分性，这为更有效的导向提供了机会。

Method: 提出DISCO Steering方法，直接调制注意力头中的查询和值表示，而不是修改注意力头输出。通过分析表明该方法能够解耦查询和值的刚性修改，实现更细粒度的控制。

Result: 在LLaMA 3.1 8B和Gemma 2 9B上的多个数据集测试中，DISCO Steering的性能优于多个基线方法，导向效果得分最高比第二名高出19.1%。

Conclusion: 查询和值表示空间是导向向量方法的强大构建模块，DISCO Steering证明了在这些空间中进行直接调制的有效性。

Abstract: A variety of recent methods guide large language model outputs via the
inference-time addition of steering vectors to residual-stream or
attention-head representations. In contrast, we propose to inject steering
vectors directly into the query and value representation spaces within
attention heads. We provide evidence that a greater portion of these spaces
exhibit high linear discriminability of concepts --a key property motivating
the use of steering vectors-- than attention head outputs. We analytically
characterize the effect of our method, which we term DISentangled COmmunication
(DISCO) Steering, on attention head outputs. Our analysis reveals that DISCO
disentangles a strong but underutilized baseline, steering attention inputs,
which implicitly modifies queries and values in a rigid manner. In contrast,
DISCO's direct modulation of these components enables more granular control. We
find that DISCO achieves superior performance over a number of steering vector
baselines across multiple datasets on LLaMA 3.1 8B and Gemma 2 9B, with
steering efficacy scoring up to 19.1% higher than the runner-up. Our results
support the conclusion that the query and value spaces are powerful building
blocks for steering vector methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Kolmogorov-Arnold Neural Operator (KANO) is a dual-domain neural operator combining spectral and spatial bases, offering symbolic interpretability and overcoming limitations of Fourier Neural Operator (FNO).


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: To address the limitations of pure-spectral approaches like FNO, which struggle with position-dependent dynamics and require spectrally sparse operators with fast-decaying Fourier tails.

Method: KANO uses a dual-domain parameterization with both spectral and spatial bases, enabling expressive modeling of generic position-dependent dynamics while maintaining symbolic interpretability.

Result: KANO significantly outperforms FNO on position-dependent differential operators and quantum Hamiltonian learning, achieving 4th decimal place accuracy in coefficient reconstruction and ≈6×10⁻⁶ state infidelity vs FNO's ≈1.5×10⁻².

Conclusion: KANO provides a more expressive and robust neural operator framework that overcomes spectral bottlenecks and enables accurate symbolic representation learning for complex physical systems.

Abstract: We introduce Kolmogorov--Arnold Neural Operator (KANO), a dual-domain neural
operator jointly parameterized by both spectral and spatial bases with
intrinsic symbolic interpretability. We theoretically demonstrate that KANO
overcomes the pure-spectral bottleneck of Fourier Neural Operator (FNO): KANO
remains expressive over generic position-dependent dynamics for any physical
input, whereas FNO stays practical only for spectrally sparse operators and
strictly imposes a fast-decaying input Fourier tail. We verify our claims
empirically on position-dependent differential operators, for which KANO
robustly generalizes but FNO fails to. In the quantum Hamiltonian learning
benchmark, KANO reconstructs ground-truth Hamiltonians in closed-form symbolic
representations accurate to the fourth decimal place in coefficients and
attains $\approx 6\times10^{-6}$ state infidelity from projective measurement
data, substantially outperforming that of the FNO trained with ideal full wave
function data, $\approx 1.5\times10^{-2}$, by orders of magnitude.

TL;DR: SOLAR提出了一种可切换输出层技术，通过为OFA训练中的每个子网络分配独立的分类头，减少参数共享带来的表示干扰，提高准确性和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: OFA训练中随着支持子网络数量增加，骨干网络中的过度参数共享限制了表示能力，导致校准性能下降和整体性能降低。

Method: SOLAR技术为每个子网络分配独立的分类头，解耦不同子网络的logit学习过程，不改变共享骨干网络。

Result: 在5个数据集和4种骨干网络上测试，SOLAR相比基线方法显著提升子网络的准确性和鲁棒性，最高提升准确率4.71%，鲁棒性9.01%。

Conclusion: SOLAR是一种简单有效的技术，通过可切换输出层显著改善了OFA训练的性能，为多场景部署提供了更好的解决方案。

Abstract: Once-for-All (OFA) training enables a single super-net to generate multiple
sub-nets tailored to diverse deployment scenarios, supporting flexible
trade-offs among accuracy, robustness, and model-size without retraining.
However, as the number of supported sub-nets increases, excessive parameter
sharing in the backbone limits representational capacity, leading to degraded
calibration and reduced overall performance. To address this, we propose SOLAR
(Switchable Output Layer for Accuracy and Robustness in Once-for-All Training),
a simple yet effective technique that assigns each sub-net a separate
classification head. By decoupling the logit learning process across sub-nets,
the Switchable Output Layer (SOL) reduces representational interference and
improves optimization, without altering the shared backbone. We evaluate SOLAR
on five datasets (SVHN, CIFAR-10, STL-10, CIFAR-100, and TinyImageNet) using
four super-net backbones (ResNet-34, WideResNet-16-8, WideResNet-40-2, and
MobileNetV2) for two OFA training frameworks (OATS and SNNs). Experiments show
that SOLAR outperforms the baseline methods: compared to OATS, it improves
accuracy of sub-nets up to 1.26 %, 4.71 %, 1.67 %, and 1.76 %, and robustness
up to 9.01 %, 7.71 %, 2.72 %, and 1.26 % on SVHN, CIFAR-10, STL-10, and
CIFAR-100, respectively. Compared to SNNs, it improves TinyImageNet accuracy by
up to 2.93 %, 2.34 %, and 1.35 % using ResNet-34, WideResNet-16-8, and
MobileNetV2 backbones (with 8 sub-nets), respectively.

Motivation: 左心室辅助设备（LVAD）支持的患者需要准确评估心室内血流，但临床成像与LVAD不兼容或只能提供稀疏、低质量的速度数据，而计算流体动力学（CFD）模拟计算量大，不适合常规临床使用。

Method: 提出LVADNet3D，采用混合下采样和更深的编码器-解码器架构，增加通道容量以更好地捕捉空间流动模式。使用CFD模拟生成高分辨率合成数据集进行训练和评估，并研究基于解剖和生理先验条件化的效果。

Result: 在各种输入配置下，LVADNet3D优于基线UNet3D模型，产生更低的重建误差和更高的PSNR结果。

Conclusion: LVADNet3D为LVAD支持患者的心室内血流评估提供了一种有效的替代方案，克服了临床成像和CFD模拟的局限性。

Abstract: Accurate assessment of intraventricular blood flow is essential for
evaluating hemodynamic conditions in patients supported by Left Ventricular
Assist Devices (LVADs). However, clinical imaging is either incompatible with
LVADs or yields sparse, low-quality velocity data. While Computational Fluid
Dynamics (CFD) simulations provide high-fidelity data, they are computationally
intensive and impractical for routine clinical use. To address this, we propose
LVADNet3D, a 3D convolutional autoencoder that reconstructs full-resolution
intraventricular velocity fields from sparse velocity vector inputs. In
contrast to a standard UNet3D model, LVADNet3D incorporates hybrid downsampling
and a deeper encoder-decoder architecture with increased channel capacity to
better capture spatial flow patterns. To train and evaluate the models, we
generate a high-resolution synthetic dataset of intraventricular blood flow in
LVAD-supported hearts using CFD simulations. We also investigate the effect of
conditioning the models on anatomical and physiological priors. Across various
input configurations, LVADNet3D outperforms the baseline UNet3D model, yielding
lower reconstruction error and higher PSNR results.

*Qishuai Wen,Zhiyuan Huang,Chun-Guang Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种统一的优化目标，同时解决Transformer注意力机制的可解释性和效率问题，通过收缩-广播自注意力机制实现线性复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer注意力机制虽然经验上成功，但其前向传播的优化目标不明确，且二次复杂度成为瓶颈。现有工作分别处理可解释性或效率问题，缺乏统一解决方案。

Method: 通过展开优化目标推导出可解释且高效的注意力机制，将token压缩为低维结构：先收缩少数代表性token，再广播回所有token。

Result: CBSA机制不仅实现线性复杂度，还能将现有注意力机制作为特例包含，在多个视觉任务上表现相当甚至更优。

Conclusion: CBSA为注意力机制提供了统一的理论框架，同时解决了可解释性和效率问题，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Attention mechanisms in Transformers have gained significant empirical
success. Nonetheless, the optimization objectives underlying their forward pass
are still unclear. Additionally, the quadratic complexity of self-attention is
increasingly prohibitive. Unlike the prior work on addressing the
interpretability or efficiency issue separately, we propose a unified
optimization objective to alleviate both issues simultaneously. By unrolling
the optimization over the objective, we derive an inherently interpretable and
efficient attention mechanism, which compresses all tokens into low-dimensional
structures by contracting a few representative tokens and then broadcasting the
contractions back. This Contract-and-Broadcast Self-Attention (CBSA) mechanism
can not only scale linearly but also generalize existing attention mechanisms
as its special cases. Experiments further demonstrate comparable performance
and even superior advantages of CBSA on several visual tasks. Code is available

### [306] [Dynamic Expert Specialization: Towards Catastrophic Forgetting-Free Multi-Domain MoE Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16882)
*Junzhuo Li,Bo Wang,Xiuze Zhou,Xuming Hu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: DES-MoE是一个动态专家专业化框架，用于解决Mixture-of-Experts模型在多领域适应中的灾难性遗忘问题，通过自适应路由、实时专家-领域相关性映射和三阶段自适应微调，在保持单领域性能的同时显著减少遗忘。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Mixture-of-Experts模型虽然通过稀疏门控专家子网络提供了巨大容量，但在适应多个领域时面临灾难性遗忘的挑战。现有方法要么计算成本过高，要么存在跨领域干扰，要么需要为每个领域单独运行。

Method: DES-MoE采用三个创新方法：(1)通过蒸馏实现预训练知识保留和任务特定更新的自适应路由；(2)实时专家-领域相关性映射以隔离领域特定梯度；(3)三阶段自适应微调计划，逐步冻结非专业化参数。

Result: 在六个领域（数学、代码、法律等）上的评估显示，DES-MoE在训练一个统一模型的同时匹配单领域ESFT性能，与全微调相比，在领域从2个扩展到6个时遗忘减少89%，收敛速度比传统方法快68%。

Conclusion: 这项工作确立了动态专家隔离作为多任务MoE适应的可扩展范式。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models offer immense capacity via sparsely gated
expert subnetworks, yet adapting them to multiple domains without catastrophic
forgetting remains an open challenge. Existing approaches either incur
prohibitive computation, suffer cross-domain interference, or require separate
runs per domain. We propose DES-MoE, a dynamic expert specialization framework
for multi-domain adaptation of Mixture-of-Experts models. DES-MoE addresses
catastrophic forgetting through three innovations: (1) an adaptive router
balancing pre-trained knowledge retention and task-specific updates via
distillation, (2) real-time expert-domain correlation mapping to isolate
domain-specific gradients, and (3) a three-phase adaptive fine-tuning schedule
that progressively freezes non-specialized parameters. Evaluated on six domains
(math, code, law, etc.), DES-MoE matches single-domain ESFT performance while
training one unified model, reduces forgetting by 89% compared to full
fine-tuning as domains scale from 2 to 6, and achieves 68% faster convergence
than conventional methods. Our work establishes dynamic expert isolation as a
scalable paradigm for multi-task MoE adaptation.

Motivation: 社交媒体信息的快速传播使得基于文本的假新闻检测变得至关重要，因为其对社会的重大影响。

Method: DRES方法利用实例难度度量来评估每个新闻文章在不同文本特征表示下的分类难度，通过动态选择最适合的文本表示和分类器集成来进行检测。

Result: 大量实验表明，DRES方法在假新闻检测任务上显著优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: 基于实例难度的表示选择和动态集成选择在提升假新闻检测性能方面具有显著效果。

Abstract: The rapid spread of information via social media has made text-based fake
news detection critically important due to its societal impact. This paper
presents a novel detection method called Dynamic Representation and Ensemble
Selection (DRES) for identifying fake news based solely on text. DRES leverages
instance hardness measures to estimate the classification difficulty for each
news article across multiple textual feature representations. By dynamically
selecting the textual representation and the most competent ensemble of
classifiers for each instance, DRES significantly enhances prediction accuracy.
Extensive experiments show that DRES achieves notable improvements over
state-of-the-art methods, confirming the effectiveness of representation
selection based on instance hardness and dynamic ensemble selection in boosting
performance. Codes and data are available at:

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文证明了对比学习中寻找局部最优解的复杂性，在离散设置中为PLS-hard，在连续设置中为CLS-hard，表明除非PLS⊆P或CLS⊆P，否则不存在多项式时间算法能找到局部最优解。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对比学习是一种强大的表示学习技术，但之前的研究只关注全局最优解的NP-hard复杂性，而局部最优解的复杂性尚未解决。本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 通过证明在离散设置（如最大化满足的三元组）中为PLS-hard，在连续设置（如最小化三元组损失）中为CLS-hard，其中PLS和CLS是分别捕获离散和连续优化中局部搜索动态的复杂性类。

Result: 证明了对各种对比学习问题，不存在多项式时间算法（局部搜索或其他）能找到局部最优解，除非PLS⊆P或CLS⊆P。即使在PLS⊆P或CLS⊆P的情况下，也存在需要指数时间才能达到局部最优解的实例。

Conclusion: 对比学习中寻找局部最优解在计算上是困难的，这为理解对比学习算法的理论局限性提供了重要见解。

Abstract: Contrastive learning is a powerful technique for discovering meaningful data
representations by optimizing objectives based on $\textit{contrastive
information}$, often given as a set of weighted triplets $\{(x_i, y_i^+,
z_{i}^-)\}_{i = 1}^m$ indicating that an "anchor" $x_i$ is more similar to a
"positive" example $y_i$ than to a "negative" example $z_i$. The goal is to
find representations (e.g., embeddings in $\mathbb{R}^d$ or a tree metric)
where anchors are placed closer to positive than to negative examples. While
finding $\textit{global}$ optima of contrastive objectives is
$\mathsf{NP}$-hard, the complexity of finding $\textit{local}$ optima --
representations that do not improve by local search algorithms such as
gradient-based methods -- remains open. Our work settles the complexity of
finding local optima in various contrastive learning problems by proving
$\mathsf{PLS}$-hardness in discrete settings (e.g., maximize satisfied
triplets) and $\mathsf{CLS}$-hardness in continuous settings (e.g., minimize
Triplet Loss), where $\mathsf{PLS}$ (Polynomial Local Search) and
$\mathsf{CLS}$ (Continuous Local Search) are well-studied complexity classes
capturing local search dynamics in discrete and continuous optimization,
respectively. Our results imply that no polynomial time algorithm (local search
or otherwise) can find a local optimum for various contrastive learning
problems, unless $\mathsf{PLS}\subseteq\mathsf{P}$ (or $\mathsf{CLS}\subseteq
\mathsf{P}$ for continuous problems). Even in the unlikely scenario that
$\mathsf{PLS}\subseteq\mathsf{P}$ (or $\mathsf{CLS}\subseteq \mathsf{P}$), our
reductions imply that there exist instances where local search algorithms need
exponential time to reach a local optimum, even for $d=1$ (embeddings on a
line).

Motivation: 联邦学习中异构硬件设备导致训练延迟严重，现有解决方案如客户端选择、异步联邦学习和部分训练存在精度降低、更新过时和模型性能受损等问题。

Method: 提出窗口式训练过程，滑动窗口定位模型训练部分，在协调的运行时预算内动态选择重要张量进行训练；采用张量重要性调整模块，协调本地和全局张量重要性以缓解数据异构性带来的偏差。

Result: 实验结果显示FedEL在时间到精度指标上相比基线方法提升高达3.87倍，同时保持或超过了最终测试精度。

Conclusion: FedEL框架有效解决了联邦学习中的训练效率问题，实现了在保持模型精度前提下的显著性能提升。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables distributed devices to collaboratively train
machine learning models while maintaining data privacy. However, the
heterogeneous hardware capabilities of devices often result in significant
training delays, as straggler clients with limited resources prolong the
aggregation process. Existing solutions such as client selection, asynchronous
FL, and partial training partially address these challenges but encounter
issues such as reduced accuracy, stale updates, and compromised model
performance due to inconsistent training contributions. To overcome these
limitations, we propose FedEL, a federated elastic learning framework that
enhances training efficiency while maintaining model accuracy. FedEL introduces
a novel window-based training process, sliding the window to locate the
training part of the model and dynamically selecting important tensors for
training within a coordinated runtime budget. This approach ensures progressive
and balanced training across all clients, including stragglers. Additionally,
FedEL employs a tensor importance adjustment module, harmonizing local and
global tensor importance to mitigate biases caused by data heterogeneity. The
experiment results show that FedEL achieves up to 3.87x improvement in
time-to-accuracy compared to baselines while maintaining or exceeding final
test accuracy.

Result: 证明了wdMC和dMC各自无法满足可审计性或修改距离的要求，而新提出的两种度量方法能够同时满足这两个关键属性。

Conclusion: 新提出的多校准度量方法为开发更强的多校准算法和多组审计提供了理论支持，揭示了多校准距离的损失景观和几何结构特征。

Abstract: Calibration is a critical property for establishing the trustworthiness of
predictors that provide uncertainty estimates. Multicalibration is a
strengthening of calibration which requires that predictors be calibrated on a
potentially overlapping collection of subsets of the domain. As
multicalibration grows in popularity with practitioners, an essential question
is: how do we measure how multicalibrated a predictor is? B{\l}asiok et al.
(2023) considered this question for standard calibration by introducing the
distance to calibration framework (dCE) to understand how calibration metrics
relate to each other and the ground truth. Building on the dCE framework, we
consider the auditability of the distance to multicalibration of a predictor
$f$.
  We begin by considering two natural generalizations of dCE to multiple
subgroups: worst group dCE (wdMC), and distance to multicalibration (dMC). We
argue that there are two essential properties of any multicalibration error
metric: 1) the metric should capture how much $f$ would need to be modified in
order to be perfectly multicalibrated; and 2) the metric should be auditable in
an information theoretic sense. We show that wdMC and dMC each fail to satisfy
one of these two properties, and that similar barriers arise when considering
the auditability of general distance to multigroup fairness notions. We then
propose two (equivalent) multicalibration metrics which do satisfy these
requirements: 1) a continuized variant of dMC; and 2) a distance to
intersection multicalibration, which leans on intersectional fairness
desiderata. Along the way, we shed light on the loss-landscape of distance to
multicalibration and the geometry of the set of perfectly multicalibrated
predictors. Our findings may have implications for the development of stronger
multicalibration algorithms as well as multigroup auditing more generally.

Motivation: 社交媒体上存在用户危险行为的检测需求，传统单模态方法效果有限，需要结合文本内容和用户关系网络信息来提高检测准确性。

Method: 1. 使用NLP对用户生成文本进行语义分析、情感识别和关键词提取；2. 构建异构用户关系图，提出新型关系图卷积网络建模用户关系、关注关系和内容传播路径；3. 将文本特征与图结构信息融合。

Result: 在真实社交媒体数据集上的实验表明，该模型相比单模态方法有显著提升。

Conclusion: 多模态融合方法能够更有效地发现风险用户，为社交媒体安全监控提供了更鲁棒和有效的解决方案。

Abstract: This paper focuses on the detection of potentially dangerous tendencies of
social media users in an innovative multimodal way. We integrate Natural
Language Processing (NLP) and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) together. Firstly,
we apply NLP on the user-generated text and conduct semantic analysis,
sentiment recognition and keyword extraction to get subtle risk signals from
social media posts. Meanwhile, we build a heterogeneous user relationship graph
based on social interaction and propose a novel relational graph convolutional
network to model user relationship, attention relationship and content
dissemination path to discover some important structural information and user
behaviors. Finally, we combine textual features extracted from these two models
above with graph structural information, which provides a more robust and
effective way to discover at-risk users. Our experiments on real social media
datasets from different platforms show that our model can achieve significant
improvement over single-modality methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多任务学习中不同目标之间的梯度干扰会降低收敛速度和最终性能，需要解决任务间的冲突问题

Method: 计算梯度干扰，构建干扰图，应用贪心图着色算法将任务分组，每个训练步骤只激活一个组内的任务，并动态重新计算分组

Result: 在六个不同数据集上的实验结果表明，该方法持续优于基线方法和最先进的多任务优化器

Conclusion: 通过确保每个小批量只包含梯度方向一致的任务，该方法能有效提升多任务学习效果，无需额外调参

Abstract: When different objectives conflict with each other in multi-task learning,
gradients begin to interfere and slow convergence, thereby reducing the final
model's performance. To address this, we introduce a scheduler that computes
gradient interference, constructs an interference graph, and then applies
greedy graph-coloring to partition tasks into groups that align well with each
other. At each training step, only one group (color class) of tasks are
activated. The grouping partition is constantly recomputed as task
relationships evolve throughout training. By ensuring that each mini-batch
contains only tasks that pull the model in the same direction, our method
improves the effectiveness of any underlying multi-task learning optimizer
without additional tuning. Since tasks within these groups will update in
compatible directions, model performance will be improved rather than impeded.
Empirical results on six different datasets show that this interference-aware
graph-coloring approach consistently outperforms baselines and state-of-the-art
multi-task optimizers.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PTQTP是首个三元权重后训练量化框架，使用2x1.58位表示将权重矩阵分解为结构化的三元{-1, 0, 1}三值平面，实现无乘法推理，在保持超强表达能力的同时达到与1位量化相同的计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型语言模型后训练量化到极低位宽时的基本权衡问题——计算效率与模型表达能力之间的冲突。现有超低位量化方法要么表达能力有限，要么计算开销过大。

Method: 提出PTQTP框架：1）理论基础的渐进逼近算法确保全局权重一致性；2）模型无关部署，无需架构修改；3）统一三元操作，无需混合精度或补偿方案。

Result: 在LLaMA3.x和Qwen3模型家族（0.6B-70B参数）上的综合实验表明，PTQTP显著优于现有低位PTQ方法，数学推理保留率达到82.4%（竞争对手为0%），接近甚至超越1.58位量化感知训练性能，而量化时间仅需单小时（相比训练方法的10-14GPU天）。

Conclusion: PTQTP为资源受限环境中的高效LLM部署提供了实用解决方案，在保持计算效率的同时显著提升了超低位量化的表达能力。

Abstract: Post-training quantization (PTQ) of large language models (LLMs) to extremely
low bit-widths remains challenging due to the fundamental trade-off between
computational efficiency and model expressiveness. While existing ultra-low-bit
PTQ methods rely on binary approximations or complex compensation mechanisms,
they suffer from either limited representational capacity or computational
overhead that undermines their efficiency gains. We introduce PTQ to
Trit-Planes (PTQTP), the first ternary-weight PTQ framework that decomposes
weight matrices into structured ternary {-1, 0, 1} trit-planes using 2x1.58-bit
representation. PTQTP achieves multiplication-free inference, identical to
1-bit quantization, while maintaining superior expressiveness through its novel
structured decomposition. Our approach provides: (1) a theoretically grounded
progressive approximation algorithm ensuring global weight consistency; (2)
model-agnostic deployment across diverse modern LLMs without architectural
modifications; and (3) uniform ternary operations that eliminate the need for
mixed-precision or compensation schemes. Comprehensive experiments across
LLaMA3.x and Qwen3 model families (0.6B-70B parameters) demonstrate that PTQTP
significantly outperforms existing low-bit PTQ methods, achieving 82.4%
mathematical reasoning retention versus 0% for competing approaches. PTQTP
approaches and sometimes surpasses 1.58-bit quantization-aware training
performance while requiring only single-hour quantization compared to 10-14 GPU
days for training-based methods. These results establish PTQTP as a practical
solution for efficient LLM deployment in resource-constrained environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的持久图嵌入方法（如持久图像、持久景观或核方法）缺乏双向连续性，无法在保持Wasserstein几何的同时确保稳定性。

Method: 持久球提供了一种双向连续映射：对1-Wasserstein距离具有Lipschitz连续性，并在其图像上存在连续逆映射。推导了显式计算公式，证明可以高效计算并实现并行化。

Result: 在涉及功能数据、时间序列、图、网格和点云的各种回归和分类任务中，持久球始终达到最先进或具有竞争力的性能，优于持久图像、持久景观和切片Wasserstein核。

Conclusion: 持久球是最接近在线性空间中反映持久图Wasserstein几何的表示方法，在理论和实证上都表现出优越性。

Abstract: We introduce persistence spheres, a novel functional representation of
persistence diagrams. Unlike existing embeddings (such as persistence images,
landscapes, or kernel methods), persistence spheres provide a bi-continuous
mapping: they are Lipschitz continuous with respect to the 1-Wasserstein
distance and admit a continuous inverse on their image. This ensures, in a
theoretically optimal way, both stability and geometric fidelity, making
persistence spheres the representation that most closely mirrors the
Wasserstein geometry of PDs in linear space. We derive explicit formulas for
persistence spheres, showing that they can be computed efficiently and
parallelized with minimal overhead. Empirically, we evaluate them on diverse
regression and classification tasks involving functional data, time series,
graphs, meshes, and point clouds. Across these benchmarks, persistence spheres
consistently deliver state-of-the-art or competitive performance compared to
persistence images, persistence landscapes, and the sliced Wasserstein kernel.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型推理模型存在计算效率低下的问题，固定的推理预算无法匹配任务复杂度的变化，导致过度思考。

Method: 采用两种互补信号实时调整推理速度：1）令牌级模型不确定性用于细粒度步进控制；2）输入复杂度估计用于知情初始化。实现策略包括：不确定性感知Alpha调度、复杂度引导Alpha初始化和混合自适应控制。

Result: 在GSM8K、MATH和SVAMP数据集上的实验表明，混合自适应控制方法在准确率-延迟权衡方面表现优越，减少了简单问题上的不必要计算，同时为复杂问题分配更多资源。

Conclusion: Adaptive Overclocking通过缓解过度思考问题，提高了推理模型的效率和整体性能。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) often suffer from computational inefficiency
due to overthinking, where a fixed reasoning budget fails to match the varying
complexity of tasks. To address this issue, we propose Adaptive Overclocking, a
method that makes the overclocking hyperparameter $\alpha$ dynamic and
context-aware. Our method adjusts reasoning speed in real time through two
complementary signals: (1) token-level model uncertainty for fine-grained
step-wise control, and (2) input complexity estimation for informed
initialization. We implement this approach with three strategies:
Uncertainty-Aware Alpha Scheduling (UA-$\alpha$S), Complexity-Guided Alpha
Initialization (CG-$\alpha$I), and a Hybrid Adaptive Control (HAC) that
combines both. Experiments on GSM8K, MATH, and SVAMP show that HAC achieves
superior accuracy-latency trade-offs, reducing unnecessary computation on
simple problems while allocating more resources to challenging ones. By
mitigating overthinking, Adaptive Overclocking enhances both efficiency and
overall reasoning performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在长尾分布的训练数据下，现有模型难以准确区分OOD样本与头/尾类样本，导致OOD检测性能显著下降。现有SCL方法存在静态温度缩放和无信息异常值的局限性。

Method: 提出RSCL方法，包含动态类别温度调整（为每个分布内类别调制温度参数）和信息性异常值挖掘（基于与头尾类亲和度识别多样异常值）。

Result: 大量实验表明，RSCL在OOD检测性能上表现优越，同时提高了分布内数据的分类准确率。

Conclusion: RSCL方法有效解决了长尾分布下的OOD检测挑战，通过动态温度调整和异常值挖掘显著提升了检测性能。

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is crucial for deploying robust machine
learning models. However, when training data follows a long-tailed
distribution, the model's ability to accurately detect OOD samples is
significantly compromised, due to the confusion between OOD samples and
head/tail classes. To distinguish OOD samples from both head and tail classes,
the separate class learning (SCL) approach has emerged as a promising solution,
which separately conduct head-specific and tail-specific class learning. To
this end, we examine the limitations of existing works of SCL and reveal that
the OOD detection performance is notably influenced by the use of static
scaling temperature value and the presence of uninformative outliers. To
mitigate these limitations, we propose a novel approach termed Refined Separate
Class Learning (RSCL), which leverages dynamic class-wise temperature
adjustment to modulate the temperature parameter for each in-distribution class
and informative outlier mining to identify diverse types of outliers based on
their affinity with head and tail classes. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that RSCL achieves superior OOD detection performance while improving the
classification accuracy on in-distribution data.

Conclusion: 保形化对校准和搜索性能有积极影响，提出的方法在超参数优化中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Bayesian hyperparameter optimization relies heavily on Gaussian Process (GP)
surrogates, due to robust distributional posteriors and strong performance on
limited training samples. GPs however underperform in categorical
hyperparameter environments or when assumptions of normality,
heteroskedasticity and symmetry are excessively challenged. Conformalized
quantile regression can address these estimation weaknesses, while still
providing robust calibration guarantees. This study builds upon early work in
this area by addressing feedback covariate shift in sequential acquisition and
integrating a wider range of surrogate architectures and acquisition functions.
Proposed algorithms are rigorously benchmarked against a range of state of the
art hyperparameter optimization methods (GP, TPE and SMAC). Findings identify
quantile surrogate architectures and acquisition functions yielding superior
performance to the current quantile literature, while validating the beneficial
impact of conformalization on calibration and search performance.

Abstract: Recently, deep learning has driven significant advancements in multivariate
time series forecasting (MTSF) tasks. However, much of the current research in
MTSF tends to evaluate models from a holistic perspective, which obscures the
individual contributions and leaves critical issues unaddressed. Adhering to
the current modeling paradigms, this work bridges these gaps by systematically
decomposing deep MTSF methods into their core, fine-grained components like
series-patching tokenization, channel-independent strategy, attention modules,
or even Large Language Models and Time-series Foundation Models. Through
extensive experiments and component-level analysis, our work offers more
profound insights than previous benchmarks that typically discuss models as a
whole.
  Furthermore, we propose a novel automated solution called TSGym for MTSF
tasks. Unlike traditional hyperparameter tuning, neural architecture searching
or fixed model selection, TSGym performs fine-grained component selection and
automated model construction, which enables the creation of more effective
solutions tailored to diverse time series data, therefore enhancing model
transferability across different data sources and robustness against
distribution shifts. Extensive experiments indicate that TSGym significantly
outperforms existing state-of-the-art MTSF and AutoML methods. All code is
publicly available on https://github.com/SUFE-AILAB/TSGym.

### [319] [On the Limits of Tabular Hardness Metrics for Deep RL: A Study with the Pharos Benchmark](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17092)
*Michelangelo Conserva,Remo Sasso,Paulo Rauber*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文探讨了深度强化学习（RL）中评估基准的选择问题，指出当前深度RL基准主要基于直觉和流行度，而表格RL则有理论驱动的硬度度量。研究发现，非表格环境的难度主要由表示硬度主导，这是表格度量忽略的因素。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度强化学习的评估缺乏像表格RL那样的理论驱动基准，当前基准选择主要依赖直觉和流行度，这阻碍了该领域的系统性进展。

Method: 引入了一个名为pharos的开源库，用于系统控制环境结构和智能体表示，通过案例研究分析表格硬度度量在深度RL中的适用性。

Result: 研究发现表格度量对深度RL智能体性能的预测能力有限，同一底层MDP在不同表示（状态向量vs像素观测）下会呈现截然不同的挑战难度。

Conclusion: 迫切需要开发新的、表示感知的硬度度量标准，pharos库为开发这类度量提供了关键工具，强调了表示硬度在深度RL评估中的核心重要性。

Abstract: Principled evaluation is critical for progress in deep reinforcement learning
(RL), yet it lags behind the theory-driven benchmarks of tabular RL. While
tabular settings benefit from well-understood hardness measures like MDP
diameter and suboptimality gaps, deep RL benchmarks are often chosen based on
intuition and popularity. This raises a critical question: can tabular hardness
metrics be adapted to guide non-tabular benchmarking? We investigate this
question and reveal a fundamental gap. Our primary contribution is
demonstrating that the difficulty of non-tabular environments is dominated by a
factor that tabular metrics ignore: representation hardness. The same
underlying MDP can pose vastly different challenges depending on whether the
agent receives state vectors or pixel-based observations. To enable this
analysis, we introduce \texttt{pharos}, a new open-source library for
principled RL benchmarking that allows for systematic control over both
environment structure and agent representations. Our extensive case study using
\texttt{pharos} shows that while tabular metrics offer some insight, they are
poor predictors of deep RL agent performance on their own. This work highlights
the urgent need for new, representation-aware hardness measures and positions
\texttt{pharos} as a key tool for developing them.

Abstract: The integration of solar power has been increasing as the green energy
transition rolls out. The penetration of solar power challenges the grid
stability and energy scheduling, due to its intermittent energy generation.
Accurate and near real-time solar power prediction is of critical importance to
tolerant and support the permeation of distributed and volatile solar power
production in the energy system. In this paper, we propose a deep-learning
based ultra-short-term solar power prediction with data reconstruction. We
decompose the data for the prediction to facilitate extensive exploration of
the spatial and temporal dependencies within the data. Particularly, we
reconstruct the data into low- and high-frequency components, using ensemble
empirical model decomposition with adaptive noise (CEEMDAN). We integrate
meteorological data with those two components, and employ deep-learning models
to capture long- and short-term dependencies towards the target prediction
period. In this way, we excessively exploit the features in historical data in
predicting a ultra-short-term solar power production. Furthermore, as
ultra-short-term prediction is vulnerable to local optima, we modify the
optimization in our deep-learning training by penalizing long prediction
intervals. Numerical experiments with diverse settings demonstrate that,
compared to baseline models, the proposed method achieves improved
generalization in data reconstruction and higher prediction accuracy for
ultra-short-term solar power production.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于Transformer的HPO方法严重依赖大规模历史优化轨迹，缺乏有效的强化学习技术，限制了效率和性能提升。

Method: 提出GRPOformer框架：使用Transformer从历史轨迹生成新超参数配置，利用GRPO实现从零开始的快速轨迹构建和策略学习，并引入PCR增强训练稳定性。

Result: 在OpenML数据集上的实验结果表明，GRPOformer在多种任务中始终优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 该研究为RL在HPO中的应用提供了新的见解，证明了GRPOformer框架的有效性。

Abstract: Hyperparameter optimization (HPO) plays a critical role in improving model
performance. Transformer-based HPO methods have shown great potential; however,
existing approaches rely heavily on large-scale historical optimization
trajectories and lack effective reinforcement learning (RL) techniques, thereby
limiting their efficiency and performance improvements. Inspired by the success
of Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) in large language models (LLMs),
we propose GRPOformer -- a novel hyperparameter optimization framework that
integrates reinforcement learning (RL) with Transformers. In GRPOformer,
Transformers are employed to generate new hyperparameter configurations from
historical optimization trajectories, while GRPO enables rapid trajectory
construction and optimization strategy learning from scratch. Moreover, we
introduce Policy Churn Regularization (PCR) to enhance the stability of GRPO
training. Experimental results on OpenML demonstrate that GRPOformer
consistently outperforms baseline methods across diverse tasks, offering new
insights into the application of RL for HPO.

Abstract: To address the intermittency of renewable energy source (RES) generation,
scenario forecasting offers a series of stochastic realizations for predictive
objects with superior flexibility and direct views. Based on a long time-series
perspective, this paper explores uncertainties in the realms of renewable power
and deep learning. Then, an uncertainty-aware model is meticulously designed
for renewable scenario forecasting, which leverages an attention mechanism and
generative adversarial networks (GANs) to precisely capture complex
spatial-temporal dynamics. To improve the interpretability of uncertain
behavior in RES generation, Bayesian deep learning and adaptive instance
normalization (AdaIN) are incorporated to simulate typical patterns and
variations. Additionally, the integration of meteorological information,
forecasts, and historical trajectories in the processing layer improves the
synergistic forecasting capability for multiscale periodic regularities.
Numerical experiments and case analyses demonstrate that the proposed approach
provides an appropriate interpretation for renewable uncertainty
representation, including both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties, and shows
superior performance over state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: 本文分析了在预测流程监控(PPM)中简化模型架构对性能的影响，发现Transformer模型参数减少85%仅导致性能下降2-3%，而LSTM对简化更敏感。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前PPM方法主要依赖深度学习模型如LSTM和Transformer，但计算成本高阻碍实际应用。虽然已有研究探索数据缩减和特征编码，但模型架构简化对性能的影响尚未充分研究。

Method: 使用两种成熟的PPM方法，在五个不同的事件日志上分析模型复杂度（参数数量和架构深度）减少对预测性能的影响。

Result: Transformer模型缩减85%参数仅导致性能下降2-3%，而LSTM对简化更敏感，特别是在等待时间预测任务中。

Conclusion: 显著的模型简化可以保持预测准确性，为更高效和可扩展的PPM解决方案铺平道路。

Abstract: Predictive Process Monitoring (PPM) aims to forecast the future behavior of
ongoing process instances using historical event data, enabling proactive
decision-making. While recent advances rely heavily on deep learning models
such as LSTMs and Transformers, their high computational cost hinders practical
adoption. Prior work has explored data reduction techniques and alternative
feature encodings, but the effect of simplifying model architectures themselves
remains underexplored. In this paper, we analyze how reducing model complexity,
both in terms of parameter count and architectural depth, impacts predictive
performance, using two established PPM approaches. Across five diverse event
logs, we show that shrinking the Transformer model by 85% results in only a
2-3% drop in performance across various PPM tasks, while the LSTM proves
slightly more sensitive, particularly for waiting time prediction. Overall, our
findings suggest that substantial model simplification can preserve predictive
accuracy, paving the way for more efficient and scalable PPM solutions.

Abstract: Cancer is one of the diseases that kill the most women in the world, with
breast cancer being responsible for the highest number of cancer cases and
consequently deaths. However, it can be prevented by early detection and,
consequently, early treatment. Any development for detection or perdition this
kind of cancer is important for a better healthy life. Many studies focus on a
model with high accuracy in cancer prediction, but sometimes accuracy alone may
not always be a reliable metric. This study implies an investigative approach
to studying the performance of different machine learning algorithms based on
boosting to predict breast cancer focusing on the recall metric. Boosting
machine learning algorithms has been proven to be an effective tool for
detecting medical diseases. The dataset of the University of California, Irvine
(UCI) repository has been utilized to train and test the model classifier that
contains their attributes. The main objective of this study is to use
state-of-the-art boosting algorithms such as AdaBoost, XGBoost, CatBoost and
LightGBM to predict and diagnose breast cancer and to find the most effective
metric regarding recall, ROC-AUC, and confusion matrix. Furthermore, our study
is the first to use these four boosting algorithms with Optuna, a library for
hyperparameter optimization, and the SHAP method to improve the
interpretability of our model, which can be used as a support to identify and
predict breast cancer. We were able to improve AUC or recall for all the models
and reduce the False Negative for AdaBoost and LigthGBM the final AUC were more
than 99.41\% for all models.

Motivation: 解决传统SVGP方法在不确定性估计、存储效率和计算成本方面的不足，同时提升异常检测能力。

Method: 采用归一化流先验和谱正则化，设计单次投影机制进行异常检测，通过诱导权重矩阵实现权重不确定性的低维投影。

Conclusion: FiD-GP框架在保持高性能的同时显著提升了计算效率和存储效率，为贝叶斯神经网络的实际应用提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: We present Flow-Induced Diagonal Gaussian Processes (FiD-GP), a compression
framework that incorporates a compact inducing weight matrix to project a
neural network's weight uncertainty into a lower-dimensional subspace.
Critically, FiD-GP relies on normalising-flow priors and spectral
regularisations to augment its expressiveness and align the inducing subspace
with feature-gradient geometry through a numerically stable projection
mechanism objective. Furthermore, we demonstrate how the prediction framework
in FiD-GP can help to design a single-pass projection for Out-of-Distribution
(OoD) detection. Our analysis shows that FiD-GP improves uncertainty estimation
ability on various tasks compared with SVGP-based baselines, satisfies tight
spectral residual bounds with theoretically guaranteed OoD detection, and
significantly compresses the neural network's storage requirements at the cost
of increased inference computation dependent on the number of inducing weights
employed. Specifically, in a comprehensive empirical study spanning regression,
image classification, semantic segmentation, and out-of-distribution detection
benchmarks, it cuts Bayesian training cost by several orders of magnitude,
compresses parameters by roughly 51%, reduces model size by about 75%, and
matches state-of-the-art accuracy and uncertainty estimation.

Abstract: In this paper, we unroll the dynamics of the dual ascent (DA) algorithm in
two coupled graph neural networks (GNNs) to solve constrained optimization
problems. The two networks interact with each other at the layer level to find
a saddle point of the Lagrangian. The primal GNN finds a stationary point for a
given dual multiplier, while the dual network iteratively refines its estimates
to reach an optimal solution. We force the primal and dual networks to mirror
the dynamics of the DA algorithm by imposing descent and ascent constraints. We
propose a joint training scheme that alternates between updating the primal and
dual networks. Our numerical experiments demonstrate that our approach yields
near-optimal near-feasible solutions and generalizes well to
out-of-distribution (OOD) problems.

Conclusion: 该方法使用开源软件和少量低成本传感器即可在全球城市推广应用，有助于填补城市空气质量信息空白，为公共卫生官员提供决策支持。

Abstract: Low-cost mobile sensors can be used to collect PM$_{2.5}$ concentration data
throughout an entire city. However, identifying air pollution hotspots from the
data is challenging due to the uneven spatial sampling, temporal variations in
the background air quality, and the dynamism of urban air pollution sources.
This study proposes a method to identify urban PM$_{2.5}$ hotspots that
addresses these challenges, involving four steps: (1) equip citizen scientists
with mobile PM$_{2.5}$ sensors while they travel; (2) normalise the raw data to
remove the influence of background ambient pollution levels; (3) fit a Gaussian
process regression model to the normalised data and (4) calculate a grid of
spatially explicit 'hotspot scores' using the probabilistic framework of
Gaussian processes, which conveniently summarise the relative pollution levels
throughout the city. We apply our method to create the first ever map of
PM$_{2.5}$ pollution in Kigali, Rwanda, at a 200m resolution. Our results
suggest that the level of ambient PM$_{2.5}$ pollution in Kigali is dangerously
high, and we identify the hotspots in Kigali where pollution consistently
exceeds the city-wide average. We also evaluate our method using simulated
mobile sensing data for Beijing, China, where we find that the hotspot scores
are probabilistically well calibrated and accurately reflect the 'ground truth'
spatial profile of PM$_{2.5}$ pollution. Thanks to the use of open-source
software, our method can be re-applied in cities throughout the world with a
handful of low-cost sensors. The method can help fill the gap in urban air
quality information and empower public health officials.

Abstract: In the era of the digitally driven economy, where there has been an
exponential surge in digital payment systems and other online activities,
various forms of fraudulent activities have accompanied the digital growth, out
of which credit card fraud has become an increasingly significant threat. To
deal with this, real-time fraud detection is essential for financial security
but remains challenging due to high transaction volumes and the complexity of
modern fraud patterns. This study presents a comprehensive performance
comparison between traditional machine learning models like Random Forest, SVM,
Logistic Regression, XGBoost, and ensemble methods like Stacking and Voting
Classifier for detecting credit card fraud on a heavily imbalanced public
dataset, where the number of fraudulent transactions is 492 out of 284,807
total transactions. Application-specific preprocessing techniques were applied,
and the models were evaluated using various performance metrics. The ensemble
methods achieved an almost perfect precision of around 0.99, but traditional
methods demonstrated superior performance in terms of recall, which highlights
the trade-off between false positives and false negatives. The comprehensive
comparison reveals distinct performance strengths and limitations for each
algorithm, offering insights to guide practitioners in selecting the most
effective model for robust fraud detection applications in real-world settings.

Conclusion: 提出的软约束框架在特征不平衡、模型误设和估计器方差之间提供了更好的权衡，特别是在高维和正性较差的情况下。

Abstract: Many common estimators in machine learning and causal inference are linear
smoothers, where the prediction is a weighted average of the training outcomes.
Some estimators, such as ordinary least squares and kernel ridge regression,
allow for arbitrarily negative weights, which improve feature imbalance but
often at the cost of increased dependence on parametric modeling assumptions
and higher variance. By contrast, estimators like importance weighting and
random forests (sometimes implicitly) restrict weights to be non-negative,
reducing dependence on parametric modeling and variance at the cost of worse
imbalance. In this paper, we propose a unified framework that directly
penalizes the level of extrapolation, replacing the current practice of a hard
non-negativity constraint with a soft constraint and corresponding
hyperparameter. We derive a worst-case extrapolation error bound and introduce
a novel "bias-bias-variance" tradeoff, encompassing biases due to feature
imbalance, model misspecification, and estimator variance; this tradeoff is
especially pronounced in high dimensions, particularly when positivity is poor.
We then develop an optimization procedure that regularizes this bound while
minimizing imbalance and outline how to use this approach as a sensitivity
analysis for dependence on parametric modeling assumptions. We demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach through synthetic experiments and a real-world
application, involving the generalization of randomized controlled trial
estimates to a target population of interest.

Motivation: 汽车空气动力学优化需要气动学家和设计师的紧密合作，但缓慢昂贵的模拟成为瓶颈。现有代理模型难以扩展到高分辨率3D问题且面临数据稀缺问题。

Method: 渐进式多分辨率训练(PMRT)，一种概率多分辨率训练策略，从低分辨率开始逐步转向高分辨率，在单GPU上24小时内训练U-Net预测阻力系数和高分辨率速度场。

Abstract: The aerodynamic optimization of cars requires close collaboration between
aerodynamicists and stylists, while slow, expensive simulations remain a
bottleneck. Surrogate models have been shown to accurately predict aerodynamics
within the design space for which they were trained. However, many of these
models struggle to scale to higher resolutions because of the 3D nature of the
problem and data scarcity. We propose Progressive Multi-Resolution Training
(PMRT), a probabilistic multi-resolution training schedule that enables
training a U-Net to predict the drag coefficient ($c_d$) and high-resolution
velocity fields (512 x 128 x 128) in 24 hours on a single NVIDIA H100 GPU, 7x
cheaper than the high-resolution-only baseline, with similar accuracy. PMRT
samples batches from three resolutions based on probabilities that change
during training, starting with an emphasis on lower resolutions and gradually
shifting toward higher resolutions. Since this is a training methodology, it
can be adapted to other high-resolution-focused backbones. We also show that a
single model can be trained across five datasets from different solvers,
including a real-world dataset, by conditioning on the simulation parameters.
In the DrivAerML dataset, our models achieve a $c_d$ $R^2$ of 0.975, matching
literature baselines at a fraction of the training cost.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统共振激发（RF）神经元在长序列建模中存在有效记忆容量有限、能量效率与训练速度之间存在权衡的问题。

Method: 提出D-RF模型，采用多树突分支编码不同频带信息，并在胞体中引入自适应阈值机制来减少冗余脉冲。

Result: 实验表明该方法在保持竞争力的准确率的同时，显著确保稀疏脉冲且不损害训练计算效率。

Conclusion: D-RF模型为边缘平台上的长序列建模提供了一个有效且高效的解决方案。

Abstract: The explosive growth in sequence length has intensified the demand for
effective and efficient long sequence modeling. Benefiting from intrinsic
oscillatory membrane dynamics, Resonate-and-Fire (RF) neurons can efficiently
extract frequency components from input signals and encode them into
spatiotemporal spike trains, making them well-suited for long sequence
modeling. However, RF neurons exhibit limited effective memory capacity and a
trade-off between energy efficiency and training speed on complex temporal
tasks. Inspired by the dendritic structure of biological neurons, we propose a
Dendritic Resonate-and-Fire (D-RF) model, which explicitly incorporates a
multi-dendritic and soma architecture. Each dendritic branch encodes specific
frequency bands by utilizing the intrinsic oscillatory dynamics of RF neurons,
thereby collectively achieving comprehensive frequency representation.
Furthermore, we introduce an adaptive threshold mechanism into the soma
structure that adjusts the threshold based on historical spiking activity,
reducing redundant spikes while maintaining training efficiency in long
sequence tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method maintains
competitive accuracy while substantially ensuring sparse spikes without
compromising computational efficiency during training. These results underscore
its potential as an effective and efficient solution for long sequence modeling
on edge platforms.

TL;DR: SignalLLM是一个基于大型语言模型的通用信号处理代理框架，通过模块化架构将高级信号处理目标分解为结构化子任务，利用检索增强生成、代码合成等技术实现跨模态信号处理任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统信号处理方法依赖专家知识和手动工程，适应性差且难以泛化。而大型语言模型具有强大的推理能力、广泛知识和上下文学习能力，可以自动化信号处理工作流程。

Method: 采用模块化架构：通过上下文学习和领域特定检索分解任务，使用层次化规划（自适应RAG和精炼），通过提示推理、跨模态推理、代码合成、模型调用等方式执行子任务。

Result: 在雷达目标检测、人体活动识别、文本压缩等五个代表性通信和感知任务中表现出色，特别是在少样本和零样本设置下优于传统方法和现有基于LLM的方法。

Conclusion: SignalLLM展示了LLM在通用信号处理任务中的巨大潜力，提供了一种灵活、可泛化的解决方案，能够适应不同信号模态、任务类型和数据条件。

Abstract: Modern signal processing (SP) pipelines, whether model-based or data-driven,
often constrained by complex and fragmented workflow, rely heavily on expert
knowledge and manual engineering, and struggle with adaptability and
generalization under limited data. In contrast, Large Language Models (LLMs)
offer strong reasoning capabilities, broad general-purpose knowledge,
in-context learning, and cross-modal transfer abilities, positioning them as
powerful tools for automating and generalizing SP workflows. Motivated by these
potentials, we introduce SignalLLM, the first general-purpose LLM-based agent
framework for general SP tasks. Unlike prior LLM-based SP approaches that are
limited to narrow applications or tricky prompting, SignalLLM introduces a
principled, modular architecture. It decomposes high-level SP goals into
structured subtasks via in-context learning and domain-specific retrieval,
followed by hierarchical planning through adaptive retrieval-augmented
generation (RAG) and refinement; these subtasks are then executed through
prompt-based reasoning, cross-modal reasoning, code synthesis, model
invocation, or data-driven LLM-assisted modeling. Its generalizable design
enables the flexible selection of problem solving strategies across different
signal modalities, task types, and data conditions. We demonstrate the
versatility and effectiveness of SignalLLM through five representative tasks in
communication and sensing, such as radar target detection, human activity
recognition, and text compression. Experimental results show superior
performance over traditional and existing LLM-based methods, particularly in
few-shot and zero-shot settings.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种在动态变化环境中解决约束满足和优化问题的新方法，将问题构建为强化学习任务，并引入条件策略生成器来处理变量统计独立的情况。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的机器学习方法主要局限于静态环境，而现实世界中的约束满足问题往往具有动态特性，需要能够适应变化约束的解决方案。

Method: 采用条件生成对抗网络的思想，将静态约束用于奖励函数指导策略训练，动态约束编码为类别标签与输入噪声一起输入，策略通过监督学习同时更新以最大化对动态条件的分类似然。

Result: 通过多模态约束满足问题的原理验证实验，比较了无条件情况和条件情况下的性能表现。

Conclusion: 该方法为动态环境中的约束满足问题提供了一种有效的强化学习解决方案框架。

Abstract: Leveraging machine learning methods to solve constraint satisfaction problems
has shown promising, but they are mostly limited to a static situation where
the problem description is completely known and fixed from the beginning. In
this work we present a new approach to constraint satisfaction and optimization
in dynamically changing environments, particularly when variables in the
problem are statistically independent. We frame it as a reinforcement learning
problem and introduce a conditional policy generator by borrowing the idea of
class conditional generative adversarial networks (GANs). Assuming that the
problem includes both static and dynamic constraints, the former are used in a
reward formulation to guide the policy training such that it learns to map to a
probabilistic distribution of solutions satisfying static constraints from a
noise prior, which is similar to a generator in GANs. On the other hand,
dynamic constraints in the problem are encoded to different class labels and
fed with the input noise. The policy is then simultaneously updated for maximum
likelihood of correctly classifying given the dynamic conditions in a
supervised manner. We empirically demonstrate a proof-of-principle experiment
with a multi-modal constraint satisfaction problem and compare between
unconditional and conditional cases.

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于分子动力学中粗粒度神经网络势能的新型主动学习框架，通过RMSD帧选择在训练过程中动态生成数据，解决了传统方法在未采样构象下性能退化的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器学习粗粒度势能虽然计算速度快，但在模拟到达未采样的生物分子构象时会性能下降，而生成全面的全原子数据在计算上不可行。

Method: 基于CGSchNet模型，采用RMSD帧选择方法从MD模拟中选择帧，在神经网络势能训练过程中通过查询oracle动态生成数据，在保持粗粒度效率的同时精确修正模型的覆盖空白。

Result: 实验表明该框架能够探索先前未见过的构象，并在构象空间的未探索区域训练模型。在Chignolin蛋白上训练的CGSchNet模型在TICA空间的Wasserstein 1指标上实现了33.05%的改进。

Conclusion: 该主动学习框架能够在保持计算效率的同时显著提升粗粒度神经网络势能的性能，有效解决了未采样构象下的模型退化问题。

Abstract: Machine learned coarse grained (CG) potentials are fast, but degrade over
time when simulations reach undersampled biomolecular conformations, and
generating widespread all atom (AA) data to combat this is computationally
infeasible. We propose a novel active learning framework for CG neural network
potentials in molecular dynamics (MD). Building on the CGSchNet model, our
method employs root mean squared deviation (RMSD) based frame selection from MD
simulations in order to generate data on the fly by querying an oracle during
the training of a neural network potential. This framework preserves CG level
efficiency while correcting the model at precise, RMSD identified coverage
gaps. By training CGSchNet, a coarse grained neural network potential, we
empirically show that our framework explores previously unseen configurations
and trains the model on unexplored regions of conformational space. Our active
learning framework enables a CGSchNet model trained on the Chignolin protein to
achieve a 33.05% improvement in the Wasserstein 1 (W1) metric in Time lagged
Independent Component Analysis (TICA) space on an in house benchmark suite.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种因果表示学习框架，用于处理多模态临床记录中的缺失数据问题，通过考虑缺失模式来整合结构化数据、影像和文本，提高患者健康预测的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床笔记包含丰富的患者信息，但经常缺失（如MIMIC-IV数据集中24.5%的患者缺少出院小结）。其他模态数据（结构化数据、胸片、放射报告）的可用性受临床决策影响，导致缺失模式非随机（MMNAR），需要专门的方法来处理这种缺失模式。

Method: 框架包含三个组件：(1) MMNAR感知的模态融合组件，整合结构化数据、影像和文本，同时考虑缺失模式；(2) 模态重建组件，使用对比学习确保表示学习的语义充分性；(3) 多任务结果预测模型，带有校正器来修正特定模态观察模式的残余偏差。

Result: 在MIMIC-IV和eICU数据集上的综合评估显示，相比最强基线方法，医院再入院预测的AUC提升达13.8%，ICU入院预测提升13.1%。

Conclusion: 该因果表示学习框架能有效处理多模态临床记录中的缺失数据问题，通过利用观察数据和信息性缺失模式，显著提高了患者健康预测的性能。

Abstract: Clinical notes contain rich patient information, such as diagnoses or
medications, making them valuable for patient representation learning. Recent
advances in large language models have further improved the ability to extract
meaningful representations from clinical texts. However, clinical notes are
often missing. For example, in our analysis of the MIMIC-IV dataset, 24.5% of
patients have no available discharge summaries. In such cases, representations
can be learned from other modalities such as structured data, chest X-rays, or
radiology reports. Yet the availability of these modalities is influenced by
clinical decision-making and varies across patients, resulting in modality
missing-not-at-random (MMNAR) patterns. We propose a causal representation
learning framework that leverages observed data and informative missingness in
multimodal clinical records. It consists of: (1) an MMNAR-aware modality fusion
component that integrates structured data, imaging, and text while conditioning
on missingness patterns to capture patient health and clinician-driven
assignment; (2) a modality reconstruction component with contrastive learning
to ensure semantic sufficiency in representation learning; and (3) a multitask
outcome prediction model with a rectifier that corrects for residual bias from
specific modality observation patterns. Comprehensive evaluations across
MIMIC-IV and eICU show consistent gains over the strongest baselines, achieving
up to 13.8% AUC improvement for hospital readmission and 13.1% for ICU
admission.

Result: 在真实数据集上的实证评估表明，该方法相比现有TSAD技术具有优越性能。

Conclusion: PMGC框架通过多图整合和前瞻性策略，有效提升了多元时间序列异常检测的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Anomaly detection in high-dimensional time series data is pivotal for
numerous industrial applications. Recent advances in multivariate time series
anomaly detection (TSAD) have increasingly leveraged graph structures to model
inter-variable relationships, typically employing Graph Neural Networks (GNNs).
Despite their promising results, existing methods often rely on a single graph
representation, which are insufficient for capturing the complex, diverse
relationships inherent in multivariate time series. To address this, we propose
the Prospective Multi-Graph Cohesion (PMGC) framework for multivariate TSAD.
PMGC exploits spatial correlations by integrating a long-term static graph with
a series of short-term instance-wise dynamic graphs, regulated through a graph
cohesion loss function. Our theoretical analysis shows that this loss function
promotes diversity among dynamic graphs while aligning them with the stable
long-term relationships encapsulated by the static graph. Additionally, we
introduce a "prospective graphing" strategy to mitigate the limitations of
traditional forecasting-based TSAD methods, which often struggle with
unpredictable future variations. This strategy allows the model to accurately
reflect concurrent inter-series relationships under normal conditions, thereby
enhancing anomaly detection efficacy. Empirical evaluations on real-world
datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our method compared to
existing TSAD techniques.

Motivation: 传统确定性预测方法难以捕捉股票价格预测中的不确定性和尾部事件，而扩散模型在概率预测方面具有优势。

Method: 采用U形编码器-解码器架构，包含跳跃连接，使用零填充的池化操作避免任意图粗化，通过图卷积层捕获局部依赖关系。

Result: 该方法能够学习原始图上保持卷积特性的特征嵌入，有效应用于股票价格的随机生成和概率预测。

Conclusion: U-GNN扩散模型在股票价格概率预测中表现出色，能够更好地处理不确定性和尾部事件。

Abstract: We introduce U-shaped encoder-decoder graph neural networks (U-GNNs) for
stochastic graph signal generation using denoising diffusion processes. The
architecture learns node features at different resolutions with skip
connections between the encoder and decoder paths, analogous to the
convolutional U-Net for image generation. The U-GNN is prominent for a pooling
operation that leverages zero-padding and avoids arbitrary graph coarsening,
with graph convolutions layered on top to capture local dependencies. This
technique permits learning feature embeddings for sampled nodes at deeper
levels of the architecture that remain convolutional with respect to the
original graph. Applied to stock price prediction -- where deterministic
forecasts struggle to capture uncertainties and tail events that are paramount
-- we demonstrate the effectiveness of the diffusion model in probabilistic
forecasting of stock prices.

TL;DR: GraphWeave是一种新的图生成方法，通过分离模式生成和图构建两个步骤，使用随机游走轨迹来学习图模式并生成新图，在多个基准数据集上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图生成方法存在局限性：基于嵌入的方法中嵌入的微小变化可能导致图结构的不可解释变化；基于离散空间扩散的方法每个步骤可能添加或删除大量节点/边，难以预测多步扩散后的图模式。

Method: GraphWeave方法分为两个步骤：1）通过随机游走学习训练图中的模式；2）首先生成符合学习模式的随机游走轨迹，然后通过优化找到最适合这些轨迹的图结构。

Result: 在4个模拟和5个真实世界基准数据集上，GraphWeave优于现有方法，特别是在PageRank、割集、社区、度分布和流等大规模图结构指标上表现显著更好，且速度比最接近的竞争对手快10倍。

Conclusion: GraphWeave是一种简单有效的图生成方法，仅需transformer和标准优化器，通过分离模式生成和图构建实现了更好的性能和效率。

Abstract: Given a set of graphs from some unknown family, we want to generate new
graphs from that family. Recent methods use diffusion on either graph
embeddings or the discrete space of nodes and edges. However, simple changes to
embeddings (say, adding noise) can mean uninterpretable changes in the graph.
In discrete-space diffusion, each step may add or remove many nodes/edges. It
is hard to predict what graph patterns we will observe after many diffusion
steps. Our proposed method, called GraphWeave, takes a different approach. We
separate pattern generation and graph construction. To find patterns in the
training graphs, we see how they transform vectors during random walks. We then
generate new graphs in two steps. First, we generate realistic random walk
"trajectories" which match the learned patterns. Then, we find the optimal
graph that fits these trajectories. The optimization infers all edges jointly,
which improves robustness to errors. On four simulated and five real-world
benchmark datasets, GraphWeave outperforms existing methods. The most
significant differences are on large-scale graph structures such as PageRank,
cuts, communities, degree distributions, and flows. GraphWeave is also 10x
faster than its closest competitor. Finally, GraphWeave is simple, needing only
a transformer and standard optimizers.

Conclusion: 基于算子的监督有效替代了复杂的多组件训练策略，为生理建模提供了更可扩展和可解释的方法，同时减少了实现负担。

Abstract: Accurate modeling of personalized cardiovascular dynamics is crucial for
non-invasive monitoring and therapy planning. State-of-the-art physics-informed
neural network (PINN) approaches employ deep, multi-branch architectures with
adversarial or contrastive objectives to enforce partial differential equation
constraints. While effective, these enhancements introduce significant training
and implementation complexity, limiting scalability and practical deployment.
We investigate physics-informed neural operator learning models as efficient
supervisory signals for training simplified architectures through knowledge
distillation. Our approach pre-trains a physics-informed DeepONet (PI-DeepONet)
on high-fidelity cuffless blood pressure recordings to learn operator mappings
from raw wearable waveforms to beat-to-beat pressure signals under embedded
physics constraints. This pre-trained operator serves as a frozen supervisor in
a lightweight knowledge-distillation pipeline, guiding streamlined base models
that eliminate complex adversarial and contrastive learning components while
maintaining performance. We characterize the role of physics-informed
regularization in operator learning and demonstrate its effectiveness for
supervisory guidance. Through extensive experiments, our operator-supervised
approach achieves performance parity with complex baselines (correlation: 0.766
vs. 0.770, RMSE: 4.452 vs. 4.501), while dramatically reducing architectural
complexity from eight critical hyperparameters to a single regularization
coefficient and decreasing training overhead by 4%. Our results demonstrate
that operator-based supervision effectively replaces intricate multi-component
training strategies, offering a more scalable and interpretable approach to
physiological modeling with reduced implementation burden.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为SPRINT的新算法，用于解决执行预测中的随机优化问题，在非凸设置下实现了O(1/T)的收敛速率，且误差邻域与随机梯度方差无关。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法如SGD-GD在非凸损失下收敛到SPS解的速度较慢（O(1/√T)），且误差邻域受随机梯度方差影响。需要改进收敛速率并减少误差。

Method: 提出SPRINT算法（随机执行预测与方差缩减），通过方差缩减技术优化随机梯度估计，提高收敛性能。

Result: SPRINT实现了O(1/T)的收敛速率，误差邻域与随机梯度方差无关。在多个真实数据集上的实验表明，SPRINT在收敛速度和稳定性上均优于SGD-GD。

Conclusion: SPRINT算法在非凸执行预测问题中显著提升了收敛性能，为处理模型诱导分布偏移的机器学习问题提供了更有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Performative prediction (PP) is an algorithmic framework for optimizing
machine learning (ML) models where the model's deployment affects the
distribution of the data it is trained on. Compared to traditional ML with
fixed data, designing algorithms in PP converging to a stable point -- known as
a stationary performative stable (SPS) solution -- is more challenging than the
counterpart in conventional ML tasks due to the model-induced distribution
shifts. While considerable efforts have been made to find SPS solutions using
methods such as repeated gradient descent (RGD) and greedy stochastic gradient
descent (SGD-GD), most prior studies assumed a strongly convex loss until a
recent work established $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{T})$ convergence of SGD-GD to SPS
solutions under smooth, non-convex losses. However, this latest progress is
still based on the restricted bounded variance assumption in stochastic
gradient estimates and yields convergence bounds with a non-vanishing error
neighborhood that scales with the variance. This limitation motivates us to
improve convergence rates and reduce error in stochastic optimization for PP,
particularly in non-convex settings. Thus, we propose a new algorithm called
stochastic performative prediction with variance reduction (SPRINT) and
establish its convergence to an SPS solution at a rate of $\mathcal{O}(1/T)$.
Notably, the resulting error neighborhood is **independent** of the variance of
the stochastic gradients. Experiments on multiple real datasets with non-convex
models demonstrate that SPRINT outperforms SGD-GD in both convergence rate and
stability.

Motivation: 现有VQE参数初始化方法受限于缺乏全面数据集，现有资源通常局限于单一领域，仅包含几百个实例，且缺乏对哈密顿量、ansatz电路和优化轨迹的完整覆盖。

Method: 构建VQEzy数据集，涵盖三个主要领域和七个代表性任务，包含12,110个实例，提供完整的VQE规范和优化轨迹。

Result: 成功创建了首个大规模VQE参数初始化数据集，为VQE优化研究提供了全面支持。

Conclusion: VQEzy数据集将在线提供并持续完善扩展，以支持未来VQE优化研究的发展。

Abstract: Variational Quantum Eigensolvers (VQEs) are a leading class of noisy
intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) algorithms, whose performance is highly
sensitive to parameter initialization. Although recent machine learning-based
initialization methods have achieved state-of-the-art performance, their
progress has been limited by the lack of comprehensive datasets. Existing
resources are typically restricted to a single domain, contain only a few
hundred instances, and lack complete coverage of Hamiltonians, ansatz circuits,
and optimization trajectories. To overcome these limitations, we introduce
VQEzy, the first large-scale dataset for VQE parameter initialization. VQEzy
spans three major domains and seven representative tasks, comprising 12,110
instances with full VQE specifications and complete optimization trajectories.
The dataset is available online, and will be continuously refined and expanded
to support future research in VQE optimization.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM智能体的训练方法（如监督微调或强化学习）在开发环境之外泛化能力差，对新工具和未见工作流程表现脆弱。代码执行反映了现实工作流程的结构，因此编程问题为构建智能体训练环境提供了自然基础。

Method: CodeGym将静态编程问题重写为交互式环境，通过提取原子函数或逻辑为可调用工具，生成可验证的任务，涵盖各种工具执行工作流程。在CodeGym中训练不同规模和思维链配置的模型。

Result: 在CodeGym中训练的模型表现出一致的分布外泛化能力，例如Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct在OOD基准τ-Bench上实现了8.7个百分点的绝对准确率提升。

Conclusion: CodeGym是朝着可扩展通用强化学习环境迈出的一步，这些环境与现实世界的智能体工作流程保持一致。

Abstract: Tool-augmented large language models (LLMs), hereafter LLM agents, leverage
external tools to solve diverse tasks and interface with the real world.
However, current training practices largely rely on supervised fine-tuning
(SFT) over static trajectories or reinforcement learning (RL) on narrow tasks,
and generalize poorly beyond development settings, leading to brittleness with
new tools and unseen workflows. Because code execution reflects many structures
of real-world workflows, coding problems provide a natural basis for building
agent training environments. Motivated by this, we introduce CodeGym, a
scalable framework that synthesizes diverse, verifiable, and controllable
multi-turn tool-use environments for agent RL, enabling LLM agents to explore
and master various workflows actively. CodeGym rewrites static coding problems
into interactive environments by extracting atomic functions or logic into
callable tools, yielding verifiable tasks that span various tool-execution
workflows. Models of varying sizes and chain-of-thought configurations, trained
in CodeGym, exhibit consistent out-of-distribution generalizability; for
example, Qwen2.5-32B-Instruct achieves an absolute accuracy gain of 8.7 points
on the OOD benchmark $\tau$-Bench. These results highlight CodeGym as a step
toward scalable general-purpose RL environments that align with real-world
agent workflows.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动态图异常检测中，现有方法假设正常模式随时间稳定，但实践中存在正常分布偏移现象，导致模型将偏移的正常实例误分类为异常，降低检测性能。

Method: 提出WhENDS方法，通过估计分布统计量并应用白化变换来对齐跨时间的正常边嵌入，从而处理正常分布偏移问题。

Result: 在四个广泛使用的动态图数据集上的大量实验表明，WhENDS持续优于九个强基线方法，取得了最先进的结果。

Conclusion: 研究强调了在动态图异常检测中解决正常分布偏移问题的重要性，WhENDS方法有效提升了检测性能。

Abstract: Anomaly detection in dynamic graphs is a critical task with broad real-world
applications, including social networks, e-commerce, and cybersecurity. Most
existing methods assume that normal patterns remain stable over time; however,
this assumption often fails in practice due to the phenomenon we refer to as
normality distribution shift (NDS), where normal behaviors evolve over time.
Ignoring NDS can lead models to misclassify shifted normal instances as
anomalies, degrading detection performance. To tackle this issue, we propose
WhENDS, a novel unsupervised anomaly detection method that aligns normal edge
embeddings across time by estimating distributional statistics and applying
whitening transformations. Extensive experiments on four widely-used dynamic
graph datasets show that WhENDS consistently outperforms nine strong baselines,
achieving state-of-the-art results and underscoring the importance of
addressing NDS in dynamic graph anomaly detection.

Result: 实验表明，所提方法在数值实验中达到了最先进的性能。在原始QSW论文的实验套件上，ABOSW和ARBOSW能够以适中的运行时开销实现与最佳QSW变体相当的收敛性能。

Conclusion: 基于贝叶斯优化的方向学习方法为切片Wasserstein距离计算提供了有效的替代方案，特别是在优化循环应用中，能够在不改变下游损失或梯度的情况下显著提升性能。

Abstract: The sliced Wasserstein distance (SW) reduces optimal transport on
$\mathbb{R}^d$ to a sum of one-dimensional projections, and thanks to this
efficiency, it is widely used in geometry, generative modeling, and
registration tasks. Recent work shows that quasi-Monte Carlo constructions for
computing SW (QSW) yield direction sets with excellent approximation error.
This paper presents an alternate, novel approach: learning directions with
Bayesian optimization (BO), particularly in settings where SW appears inside an
optimization loop (e.g., gradient flows). We introduce a family of drop-in
selectors for projection directions: BOSW, a one-shot BO scheme on the unit
sphere; RBOSW, a periodic-refresh variant; ABOSW, an adaptive hybrid that seeds
from competitive QSW sets and performs a few lightweight BO refinements; and
ARBOSW, a restarted hybrid that periodically relearns directions during
optimization. Our BO approaches can be composed with QSW and its variants
(demonstrated by ABOSW/ARBOSW) and require no changes to downstream losses or
gradients. We provide numerical experiments where our methods achieve
state-of-the-art performance, and on the experimental suite of the original QSW
paper, we find that ABOSW and ARBOSW can achieve convergence comparable to the
best QSW variants with modest runtime overhead.

*Masako Kishida*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文扩展了Fazlyab的二次约束和半定规划框架，将其应用于分布鲁棒和尾部风险感知的神经网络验证，通过集成基于矩的模糊集的最坏情况条件风险价值来考虑尾部风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 确保神经网络在输入不确定性下的安全性是安全关键应用中的基本挑战，特别是在需要考虑尾部事件严重性的领域。

Method: 将最坏情况条件风险价值集成到二次约束和半定规划框架中，扩展输入不确定性几何覆盖（椭球体、多面体、超平面），保持SDP可检查性。

Result: 通过数值实验展示了在控制系统闭环可达性和分类中的应用，风险水平ε在保守性和尾部事件容忍度之间进行权衡。

Conclusion: 该方法扩展了神经网络验证和鲁棒性分析的适用性，同时保留了先前QC/SDP方法的计算结构，适用于安全关键领域。

Abstract: Ensuring the safety of neural networks under input uncertainty is a
fundamental challenge in safety-critical applications. This paper builds on and
expands Fazlyab's quadratic-constraint (QC) and semidefinite-programming (SDP)
framework for neural network verification to a distributionally robust and
tail-risk-aware setting by integrating worst-case Conditional Value-at-Risk
(WC-CVaR) over a moment-based ambiguity set with fixed mean and covariance. The
resulting conditions remain SDP-checkable and explicitly account for tail risk.
This integration broadens input-uncertainty geometry-covering ellipsoids,
polytopes, and hyperplanes-and extends applicability to safety-critical domains
where tail-event severity matters. Applications to closed-loop reachability of
control systems and classification are demonstrated through numerical
experiments, illustrating how the risk level $\varepsilon$ trades conservatism
for tolerance to tail events-while preserving the computational structure of
prior QC/SDP methods for neural network verification and robustness analysis.

Conclusion: 原型引导学习和粗到细融合方法对于鲁棒的多模态理解是有效的。

Abstract: Multimodal intent recognition (MMIR) suffers from weak semantic grounding and
poor robustness under noisy or rare-class conditions. We propose MVCL-DAF++,
which extends MVCL-DAF with two key modules: (1) Prototype-aware contrastive
alignment, aligning instances to class-level prototypes to enhance semantic
consistency; and (2) Coarse-to-fine attention fusion, integrating global
modality summaries with token-level features for hierarchical cross-modal
interaction. On MIntRec and MIntRec2.0, MVCL-DAF++ achieves new
state-of-the-art results, improving rare-class recognition by +1.05\% and
+4.18\% WF1, respectively. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of
prototype-guided learning and coarse-to-fine fusion for robust multimodal

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于周期性图增强的多变量时间序列异常检测器（PGMA），通过动态图结构来更好地捕捉复杂的时空相关性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的多变量时间序列异常检测方法大多基于静态图结构，无法准确表示MTS中复杂的时空相关性，这限制了检测性能。

Method: PGMA采用两种关键技术：1）基于FFT的周期性时间槽分配策略，使图结构能够反映MTS的动态变化；2）结合图神经网络和时间扩展卷积，从重构的周期性图中准确提取复杂的时空相关性。

Result: 在四个真实应用数据集上的实验表明，PGMA在多变量时间序列异常检测任务中优于现有的最先进模型。

Conclusion: 该研究证明了动态图结构在MTS异常检测中的重要性，PGMA方法能够有效提升检测性能，为复杂时空相关性的建模提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Multivariate time series (MTS) anomaly detection commonly encounters in
various domains like finance, healthcare, and industrial monitoring. However,
existing MTS anomaly detection methods are mostly defined on the static graph
structure, which fails to perform an accurate representation of complex
spatio-temporal correlations in MTS. To address this issue, this study proposes
a Periodic Graph-Enhanced Multivariate Time Series Anomaly Detector (PGMA) with
the following two-fold ideas: a) designing a periodic time-slot allocation
strategy based Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), which enables the graph structure
to reflect dynamic changes in MTS; b) utilizing graph neural network and
temporal extension convolution to accurate extract the complex spatio-temporal
correlations from the reconstructed periodic graphs. Experiments on four real
datasets from real applications demonstrate that the proposed PGMA outperforms
state-of-the-art models in MTS anomaly detection.

TL;DR: 本文提出了路径加权积分梯度（PWIG），这是对广泛使用的归因方法集成梯度（IG）的推广，通过在归因积分中加入可自定义的加权函数，允许在基线和输入之间的路径不同段上进行针对性强调。

Conclusion: PWIG为复杂预测模型中的归因质量提升提供了一种灵活且理论上有依据的方法。

Abstract: Integrated Gradients (IG) is a widely used attribution method in explainable
artificial intelligence (XAI). In this paper, we introduce Path-Weighted
Integrated Gradients (PWIG), a generalization of IG that incorporates a
customizable weighting function into the attribution integral. This
modification allows for targeted emphasis along different segments of the path
between a baseline and the input, enabling improved interpretability, noise
mitigation, and the detection of path-dependent feature relevance. We establish
its theoretical properties and illustrate its utility through experiments on a
dementia classification task using the OASIS-1 MRI dataset. Attribution maps
generated by PWIG highlight clinically meaningful brain regions associated with
various stages of dementia, providing users with sharp and stable explanations.
The results suggest that PWIG offers a flexible and theoretically grounded
approach for enhancing attribution quality in complex predictive models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统流量分类方法（如基于端口的识别和深度包检测）在加密载荷和动态应用行为下效果不佳，需要探索新的分类技术。

Method: 开发预处理管道将原始信道记录转换为结构化表示，提出BiLSTM-Conformer混合网络（BiLCNet），结合BiLSTM的时序建模能力和Conformer的空间特征提取能力。

Result: 在噪声受限的5G SA数据集上，模型分类准确率达到93.9%，优于传统机器学习和深度学习算法，并在零样本迁移设置下表现出良好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 利用5G SA网络物理信道数据进行流量分类是可行的，BiLCNet模型在复杂环境下具有鲁棒性和良好的性能表现。

Abstract: Accurate and efficient traffic classification is vital for wireless network
management, especially under encrypted payloads and dynamic application
behavior, where traditional methods such as port-based identification and deep
packet inspection (DPI) are increasingly inadequate. This work explores the
feasibility of using physical channel data collected from the air interface of
5G Standalone (SA) networks for traffic sensing. We develop a preprocessing
pipeline to transform raw channel records into structured representations with
customized feature engineering to enhance downstream classification
performance. To jointly capture temporal dependencies and both local and global
structural patterns inherent in physical channel records, we propose a novel
hybrid architecture: BiLSTM-Conformer Network (BiLCNet), which integrates the
sequential modeling capability of Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory networks
(BiLSTM) with the spatial feature extraction strength of Conformer blocks.
Evaluated on a noise-limited 5G SA dataset, our model achieves a classification
accuracy of 93.9%, outperforming a series of conventional machine learning and
deep learning algorithms. Furthermore, we demonstrate its generalization
ability under zero-shot transfer settings, validating its robustness across
traffic categories and varying environmental conditions.

TL;DR: 本文通过精心设计的合成任务揭示了Mamba架构的固有局限性，发现其非线性卷积引入的不对称偏置会显著损害对称模式识别能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解Mamba与Transformer架构之间的根本差异，揭示Mamba在处理对称模式和关系时的内在限制

Method: 使用复合函数和逆序列匹配等合成任务进行实验分析，识别Mamba的非线性卷积导致的对称性偏置问题

Result: Mamba强烈偏好组合性解决方案而非对称性解决方案，在处理反向序列匹配任务时表现困难，这些限制源于非线性卷积对token信息的不对称融合

Conclusion: 这些发现为理解Mamba的约束提供了新视角，并为未来序列模型的架构改进提出了具体建议

Abstract: State Space Models (SSMs) have emerged as promising alternatives to attention
mechanisms, with the Mamba architecture demonstrating impressive performance
and linear complexity for processing long sequences. However, the fundamental
differences between Mamba and Transformer architectures remain incompletely
understood. In this work, we use carefully designed synthetic tasks to reveal
Mamba's inherent limitations. Through experiments, we identify that Mamba's
nonlinear convolution introduces an asymmetry bias that significantly impairs
its ability to recognize symmetrical patterns and relationships. Using
composite function and inverse sequence matching tasks, we demonstrate that
Mamba strongly favors compositional solutions over symmetrical ones and
struggles with tasks requiring the matching of reversed sequences. We show
these limitations stem not from the SSM module itself but from the nonlinear
convolution preceding it, which fuses token information asymmetrically. These
insights provide a new understanding of Mamba's constraints and suggest
concrete architectural improvements for future sequence models.

TL;DR: 本文提出了UnCLe框架，针对持续学习环境中的机器学习遗忘问题，解决了传统遗忘算法在CL环境中导致的性能下降和任务复发问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI安全和数据隐私问题日益突出，机器学习遗忘成为重要解决方案。但现有遗忘算法主要针对离线训练，无法适应持续学习环境，且需要数据支持，与CL丢弃历史数据的理念冲突。

Method: 提出UnCLe框架，使用超网络生成任务特定参数，通过任务嵌入实现数据无关的遗忘。遗忘时将对应对网络参数与噪声对齐，无需任何数据。

Result: 在多个视觉数据集上的实验表明，UnCLe能够顺序执行多次学习和遗忘操作，对已有知识干扰最小。

Conclusion: UnCLe为持续学习环境提供了有效的数据无关遗忘解决方案，解决了传统方法的局限性。

Abstract: Growing concerns surrounding AI safety and data privacy have driven the
development of Machine Unlearning as a potential solution. However, current
machine unlearning algorithms are designed to complement the offline training
paradigm. The emergence of the Continual Learning (CL) paradigm promises
incremental model updates, enabling models to learn new tasks sequentially.
Naturally, some of those tasks may need to be unlearned to address safety or
privacy concerns that might arise. We find that applying conventional
unlearning algorithms in continual learning environments creates two critical
problems: performance degradation on retained tasks and task relapse, where
previously unlearned tasks resurface during subsequent learning. Furthermore,
most unlearning algorithms require data to operate, which conflicts with CL's
philosophy of discarding past data. A clear need arises for unlearning
algorithms that are data-free and mindful of future learning. To that end, we
propose UnCLe, an Unlearning framework for Continual Learning. UnCLe employs a
hypernetwork that learns to generate task-specific network parameters, using
task embeddings. Tasks are unlearned by aligning the corresponding generated
network parameters with noise, without requiring any data. Empirical
evaluations on several vision data sets demonstrate UnCLe's ability to
sequentially perform multiple learning and unlearning operations with minimal
disruption to previously acquired knowledge.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有电池建模方法存在多种局限：基于模型的方法需要大量参数；数据驱动方法依赖标注数据集；当前物理信息神经网络缺乏老化适应能力或仍需大量参数。需要一种更高效的电池建模方法。

Method: SeqBattNet包含编码器和解码器两部分：编码器使用HRM-GRU深度学习模块生成循环特定的老化适应参数；解码器基于等效电路模型结合深度学习，利用这些参数和输入电流预测电压。

Result: 在三个基准数据集（TRI、RT-Batt和NASA）上的广泛评估表明，SeqBattNet显著优于经典序列模型和PINN基线，实现了更低的RMSE，同时保持计算效率。

Conclusion: SeqBattNet仅需三个基本电池参数，在单个电池数据上训练即可获得鲁棒性能，为电池管理系统的状态估计提供了高效可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate battery modeling is essential for reliable state estimation in
modern applications, such as predicting the remaining discharge time and
remaining discharge energy in battery management systems. Existing approaches
face several limitations: model-based methods require a large number of
parameters; data-driven methods rely heavily on labeled datasets; and current
physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) often lack aging adaptation, or still
depend on many parameters, or continuously regenerate states. In this work, we
propose SeqBattNet, a discrete-state PINN with built-in aging adaptation for
battery modeling, to predict terminal voltage during the discharge process.
SeqBattNet consists of two components: (i) an encoder, implemented as the
proposed HRM-GRU deep learning module, which generates cycle-specific aging
adaptation parameters; and (ii) a decoder, based on the equivalent circuit
model (ECM) combined with deep learning, which uses these parameters together
with the input current to predict voltage. The model requires only three basic
battery parameters and, when trained on data from a single cell, still achieves
robust performance. Extensive evaluations across three benchmark datasets (TRI,
RT-Batt, and NASA) demonstrate that SeqBattNet significantly outperforms
classical sequence models and PINN baselines, achieving consistently lower RMSE
while maintaining computational efficiency.

Motivation: 开发快速且可解释的图分类方法，解决现有基于子结构的核方法计算复杂度高的问题，同时保持分类准确性。

Method: 使用拓扑指数构建紧凑特征向量，采用径向基函数核计算图相似度；提出扩展特征向量（EFV）和线性组合拓扑核（LCTK）两种扩展方法。

Conclusion: LCTK和EFV在准确性和效率之间提供了有利的权衡，是实用图学习应用的强有力候选方法。

Abstract: We introduce a novel class of explicit feature maps based on topological
indices that represent each graph by a compact feature vector, enabling fast
and interpretable graph classification. Using radial basis function kernels on
these compact vectors, we define a measure of similarity between graphs. We
perform evaluation on standard molecular datasets and observe that
classification accuracies based on single topological-index feature vectors
underperform compared to state-of-the-art substructure-based kernels. However,
we achieve significantly faster Gram matrix evaluation -- up to $20\times$
faster -- compared to the Weisfeiler--Lehman subtree kernel. To enhance
performance, we propose two extensions: 1) concatenating multiple topological
indices into an \emph{Extended Feature Vector} (EFV), and 2) \emph{Linear
Combination of Topological Kernels} (LCTK) by linearly combining Radial Basis
Function kernels computed on feature vectors of individual topological graph
indices. These extensions deliver up to $12\%$ percent accuracy gains across
all the molecular datasets. A complexity analysis highlights the potential for
exponential quantum speedup for some of the vector components. Our results
indicate that LCTK and EFV offer a favourable trade-off between accuracy and
efficiency, making them strong candidates for practical graph learning
applications.

Abstract: This research investigates how Machine Learning (ML) algorithms can assist in
workload allocation strategies by detecting tasks with node affinity operators
(referred to as constraint operators), which constrain their execution to a
limited number of nodes. Using real-world Google Cluster Data (GCD) workload
traces and the AGOCS framework, the study extracts node attributes and task
constraints, then analyses them to identify suitable node-task pairings. It
focuses on tasks that can be executed on either a single node or fewer than a
thousand out of 12.5k nodes in the analysed GCD cluster. Task constraint
operators are compacted, pre-processed with one-hot encoding, and used as
features in a training dataset. Various ML classifiers, including Artificial
Neural Networks, K-Nearest Neighbours, Decision Trees, Naive Bayes, Ridge
Regression, Adaptive Boosting, and Bagging, are fine-tuned and assessed for
accuracy and F1-scores. The final ensemble voting classifier model achieved 98%
accuracy and a 1.5-1.8% misclassification rate for tasks with a single suitable
node.

Abstract: In this work, we consider learning over multitask graphs, where each agent
aims to estimate its own parameter vector. Although agents seek distinct
objectives, collaboration among them can be beneficial in scenarios where
relationships between tasks exist. Among the various approaches to promoting
relationships between tasks and, consequently, enhancing collaboration between
agents, one notable method is regularization. While previous multitask learning
studies have focused on smooth regularization to enforce graph smoothness, this
work explores non-smooth regularization techniques that promote sparsity,
making them particularly effective in encouraging piecewise constant
transitions on the graph. We begin by formulating a global regularized
optimization problem, which involves minimizing the aggregate sum of individual
costs, regularized by a general non-smooth term designed to promote
piecewise-constant relationships between the tasks of neighboring agents. Based
on the forward-backward splitting strategy, we propose a decentralized learning
approach that enables efficient solutions to the regularized optimization
problem. Then, under convexity assumptions on the cost functions and
co-regularization, we establish that the proposed approach converges in the
mean-square-error sense within $O(\mu)$ of the optimal solution of the globally
regularized cost. For broader applicability and improved computational
efficiency, we also derive closed-form expressions for commonly used non-smooth
(and, possibly, non-convex) regularizers, such as the weighted sum of the
$\ell_0$-norm, $\ell_1$-norm, and elastic net regularization. Finally, we
illustrate both the theoretical findings and the effectiveness of the approach
through simulations.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a general framework for testing the equality of the
conditional distributions in a two-sample problem. This problem is most
relevant to transfer learning under covariate shift. Our framework is built on
neural network-based generative methods and sample splitting techniques by
transforming the conditional distribution testing problem into an unconditional
one. We introduce two special tests: the generative permutation-based
conditional distribution equality test and the generative classification
accuracy-based conditional distribution equality test. Theoretically, we
establish a minimax lower bound for statistical inference in testing the
equality of two conditional distributions under certain smoothness conditions.
We demonstrate that the generative permutation-based conditional distribution
equality test and its modified version can attain this lower bound precisely or
up to some iterated logarithmic factor. Moreover, we prove the testing
consistency of the generative classification accuracy-based conditional
distribution equality test. We also establish the convergence rate for the
learned conditional generator by deriving new results related to the
recently-developed offset Rademacher complexity and approximation properties
using neural networks. Empirically, we conduct numerical studies including
synthetic datasets and two real-world datasets, demonstrating the effectiveness
of our approach.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种结合可验证结果与模型置信度估计的强化学习技术，通过丰富奖励信号来改进大语言模型的推理过程，提高性能并减少推理时的token消耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于可验证奖励的强化学习（RLVR）存在两个关键限制：1）二元反馈过于稀疏，无法捕捉推理过程的质量；2）粗粒度奖励可能导致梯度消失。受人类学习启发，需要更细粒度的反馈机制。

Method: 提出一种RL技术，将可验证结果（如正确性或可执行性）与模型自身的置信度估计相结合，通过联合设计丰富奖励信号，提供更细粒度的反馈并隐式监督推理过程。

Result: 实验结果表明，该方法在多个数据集上提升了RL性能，减少了推理时的token消耗，且仅带来可忽略的额外训练成本。该方法可作为插件模块增强其他最先进的RL方法。

Conclusion: 结合可验证结果与置信度估计的联合设计能够有效改进RL性能，提供更丰富的奖励信号，同时保持训练效率，具有很好的通用性和实用性。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a standard paradigm for refining large
language models (LLMs) beyond pre-training and instruction tuning. A prominent
line of work is RL with verifiable rewards (RLVR), which leverages
automatically verifiable outcomes (e.g., correctness or executability) to
generate reward signals. While efficient, this framework faces two key
limitations: First, its binary feedback is too sparse to capture the quality of
the reasoning process. Second, its coarse-grained rewards potentially lead to
vanishing gradients. Inspired by observations from human learning, we introduce
a RL technique that integrates verifiable outcomes with the model's own
confidence estimates. This joint design enriches the reward signal, providing
finer-grained feedback and implicitly supervising the reasoning process.
Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method enhances RL
performance across multiple datasets and reduces token consumption during
inference, while incurring negligible additional training cost. Moreover, it
can be used as a plug-in module to enhance other state-of-the-art RL methods.

Result: AutoGluonTS在解决这一气候学问题时表现出与大型业务平台相当的竞争力，同时在时间和资源方面的计算成本相对较低。

Conclusion: AutoML工具如AutoGluonTS能够有效解决复杂的中期最大温度预测问题，为气候预测提供了计算效率高的替代方案。

Abstract: In recent years, great progress has been made in the field of forecasting
meteorological variables. Recently, deep learning architectures have made a
major breakthrough in forecasting the daily average temperature over a ten-day
horizon. However, advances in forecasting events related to the maximum
temperature over short horizons remain a challenge for the community. A problem
that is even more complex consists in making predictions of the maximum daily
temperatures in the short, medium, and long term. In this work, we focus on
forecasting events related to the maximum daily temperature over medium-term
periods (90 days). Therefore, instead of addressing the problem from a
meteorological point of view, this article tackles it from a climatological
point of view. Due to the complexity of this problem, a common approach is to
frame the study as a temporal classification problem with the classes: maximum
temperature "above normal", "normal" or "below normal". From a practical point
of view, we created a large historical dataset (from 1981 to 2018) collecting
information from weather stations located in South America. In addition, we
also integrated exogenous information from the Pacific, Atlantic, and Indian
Ocean basins. We applied the AutoGluonTS platform to solve the above-mentioned
problem. This AutoML tool shows competitive forecasting performance with
respect to large operational platforms dedicated to tackling this
climatological problem; but with a "relatively" low computational cost in terms
of time and resources.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该研究通过grokking训练机制分离了神经崩溃和损失平坦度对泛化的因果关系，发现平坦度是泛化的更基本预测因子，而神经崩溃只是平坦度的结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解神经崩溃和损失平坦度在泛化中的因果作用——它们是泛化的前提条件还是训练动态的副产品。

Method: 使用grokking训练机制，在记忆化先于泛化的情况下，时间上分离泛化与训练动态，分析神经崩溃和平坦度的出现时机。

Result: 神经崩溃和相对平坦度在泛化开始时同时出现，但只有平坦度能一致预测泛化；阻止平坦度会延迟泛化，而控制神经崩溃不影响泛化能力。

Conclusion: 相对平坦度是泛化的潜在必要且更基本的属性，神经崩溃只是平坦度在经典假设下的结果，grokking可作为研究泛化几何基础的有效工具。

Abstract: Neural collapse, i.e., the emergence of highly symmetric, class-wise
clustered representations, is frequently observed in deep networks and is often
assumed to reflect or enable generalization. In parallel, flatness of the loss
landscape has been theoretically and empirically linked to generalization. Yet,
the causal role of either phenomenon remains unclear: Are they prerequisites
for generalization, or merely by-products of training dynamics? We disentangle
these questions using grokking, a training regime in which memorization
precedes generalization, allowing us to temporally separate generalization from
training dynamics and we find that while both neural collapse and relative
flatness emerge near the onset of generalization, only flatness consistently
predicts it. Models encouraged to collapse or prevented from collapsing
generalize equally well, whereas models regularized away from flat solutions
exhibit delayed generalization. Furthermore, we show theoretically that neural
collapse implies relative flatness under classical assumptions, explaining
their empirical co-occurrence. Our results support the view that relative
flatness is a potentially necessary and more fundamental property for
generalization, and demonstrate how grokking can serve as a powerful probe for
isolating its geometric underpinnings.

Motivation: 表格数据在数据科学中占主导地位，但在数据有限或敏感时对生成模型构成挑战。现有方法难以有效处理异构数据类型和缺乏局部结构等表格数据特征。

Method: 基于最大熵原理的生成熵最大化方法，直接捕获列间的n阶交互关系（成对、三阶等），使用比深度神经网络少得多的可训练参数。

Result: 在68%的测试数据集上匹配或超越先前最先进的深度神经网络方法，证明真实世界数据中的信息主要存在于低维、可解释的相关关系中。

Conclusion: GEM-T为结构化数据的轻量级高性能生成模型提供了一个有前景的方向，能更好地处理异构数据类型和表格数据的其他特征。

Abstract: Tabular data dominates data science but poses challenges for generative
models, especially when the data is limited or sensitive. We present a novel
approach to generating synthetic tabular data based on the principle of maximum
entropy -- MaxEnt -- called GEM-T, for ``generative entropy maximization for
tables.'' GEM-T directly captures nth-order interactions -- pairwise,
third-order, etc. -- among columns of training data. In extensive testing,
GEM-T matches or exceeds deep neural network approaches previously regarded as
state-of-the-art in 23 of 34 publicly available datasets representing diverse
subject domains (68\%). Notably, GEM-T involves orders-of-magnitude fewer
trainable parameters, demonstrating that much of the information in real-world
data resides in low-dimensional, potentially human-interpretable correlations,
provided that the input data is appropriately transformed first. Furthermore,
MaxEnt better handles heterogeneous data types (continuous vs. discrete vs.
categorical), lack of local structure, and other features of tabular data.
GEM-T represents a promising direction for light-weight high-performance
generative models for structured data.

Abstract: Neural fields offer continuous, learnable representations that extend beyond
traditional discrete formats in visual computing. We study the problem of
learning neural representations of repeated antiderivatives directly from a
function, a continuous analogue of summed-area tables. Although widely used in
discrete domains, such cumulative schemes rely on grids, which prevents their
applicability in continuous neural contexts. We introduce and analyze a range
of neural methods for repeated integration, including both adaptations of prior
work and novel designs. Our evaluation spans multiple input dimensionalities
and integration orders, assessing both reconstruction quality and performance
in downstream tasks such as filtering and rendering. These results enable
integrating classical cumulative operators into modern neural systems and offer
insights into learning tasks involving differential and integral operators.

Conclusion: MLLM-CD框架成功解决了多模态因果发现的挑战，为从非结构化数据中挖掘因果机制提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Uncovering cause-and-effect mechanisms from data is fundamental to scientific
progress. While large language models (LLMs) show promise for enhancing causal
discovery (CD) from unstructured data, their application to the increasingly
prevalent multimodal setting remains a critical challenge. Even with the advent
of multimodal LLMs (MLLMs), their efficacy in multimodal CD is hindered by two
primary limitations: (1) difficulty in exploring intra- and inter-modal
interactions for comprehensive causal variable identification; and (2)
insufficiency to handle structural ambiguities with purely observational data.
To address these challenges, we propose MLLM-CD, a novel framework for
multimodal causal discovery from unstructured data. It consists of three key
components: (1) a novel contrastive factor discovery module to identify genuine
multimodal factors based on the interactions explored from contrastive sample
pairs; (2) a statistical causal structure discovery module to infer causal
relationships among discovered factors; and (3) an iterative multimodal
counterfactual reasoning module to refine the discovery outcomes iteratively by
incorporating the world knowledge and reasoning capabilities of MLLMs.
Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of MLLM-CD in revealing genuine factors and causal relationships
among them from multimodal unstructured data.

Conclusion: 通过系统评估确定了FP4训练的最优配置，为低精度训练提供了实用的设计指导。

Abstract: The increasing computational demands of foundation models have spurred
research into low-precision training, with 4-bit floating-point (\texttt{FP4})
formats emerging as a frontier for maximizing hardware throughput. While
numerous techniques have been proposed to stabilize \texttt{FP4} training, they
often present isolated solutions with varying, and not always clear,
computational overheads. This paper aims to provide a unified view of the
design space of \texttt{FP4} training. We introduce a comprehensive,
quantisation gradient-based framework for microscaling quantization that allows
for a theoretical analysis of the computational costs associated with different
stabilization methods on both the forward and backward passes. Using a
simulator built on this framework, we conduct an extensive empirical study
across a wide range of machine learning tasks, including regression, image
classification, diffusion models, and language models. By systematically
evaluating thousands of combinations of techniques, such as novel gradient
approximations, rounding strategies, and scaling methods, we identify which
configurations offer the most favourable performance-to-overhead trade-off. We
find that the techniques enabling the best trade-off involve carefully
combining Hadamard transformations, tensor scaling and stochastic rounding. We
further find that using \texttt{UE5M3} as a scaling factor potentially offers a
good compromise between range and precision with manageable computational
overhead.

Abstract: World models have shown potential in artificial intelligence by predicting
and reasoning about world states beyond direct observations. However, existing
approaches are predominantly evaluated in synthetic environments or constrained
scene settings, limiting their validation in real-world contexts with broad
spatial coverage and complex semantics. Meanwhile, remote sensing applications
urgently require spatial reasoning capabilities for disaster response and urban
planning. This paper bridges these gaps by introducing the first framework for
world modeling in remote sensing. We formulate remote sensing world modeling as
direction-conditioned spatial extrapolation, where models generate semantically
consistent adjacent image tiles given a central observation and directional
instruction. To enable rigorous evaluation, we develop RSWISE (Remote Sensing
World-Image Spatial Evaluation), a benchmark containing 1,600 evaluation tasks
across four scenarios: general, flood, urban, and rural. RSWISE combines visual
fidelity assessment with instruction compliance evaluation using GPT-4o as a
semantic judge, ensuring models genuinely perform spatial reasoning rather than
simple replication. Afterwards, we present RemoteBAGEL, a unified multimodal
model fine-tuned on remote sensing data for spatial extrapolation tasks.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that RemoteBAGEL consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines on RSWISE.

Motivation: 现有深度学习方法在处理不规则多变量时间序列时，由于通道间观测不同步，导致通道建模效果不佳，需要新的方法来缓解这种通道异步性问题。

Method: 提出MTM模型，包含掩码连接池化逐步降采样时间序列，以及新颖的通道间令牌混合机制，主动选择重要令牌在不同通道间进行混合。

Result: 在真实世界数据集上的实验表明，MTM在所有基准测试中都取得了最佳性能，分类AUPRC指标最高提升3.8%。

Conclusion: MTM通过多尺度处理和通道间令牌混合有效解决了不规则多变量时间序列的通道异步性问题，显著提升了分类性能。

Abstract: Irregular multivariate time series (IMTS) is characterized by the lack of
synchronized observations across its different channels. In this paper, we
point out that this channel-wise asynchrony can lead to poor channel-wise
modeling of existing deep learning methods. To overcome this limitation, we
propose MTM, a multi-scale token mixing transformer for the classification of
IMTS. We find that the channel-wise asynchrony can be alleviated by
down-sampling the time series to coarser timescales, and propose to incorporate
a masked concat pooling in MTM that gradually down-samples IMTS to enhance the
channel-wise attention modules. Meanwhile, we propose a novel channel-wise
token mixing mechanism which proactively chooses important tokens from one
channel and mixes them with other channels, to further boost the channel-wise
learning of our model. Through extensive experiments on real-world datasets and
comparison with state-of-the-art methods, we demonstrate that MTM consistently
achieves the best performance on all the benchmarks, with improvements of up to
3.8% in AUPRC for classification.

Conclusion: MSGAT-GRU是一个可扩展且泛化能力强的智能交通系统模型，能够提供可解释的信号，为主动交通管理和道路安全分析提供支持。

Abstract: Accurate prediction of road accidents remains challenging due to intertwined
spatial, temporal, and contextual factors in urban traffic. We propose
MSGAT-GRU, a multi-scale graph attention and recurrent model that jointly
captures localized and long-range spatial dependencies while modeling
sequential dynamics. Heterogeneous inputs, such as traffic flow, road
attributes, weather, and points of interest, are systematically fused to
enhance robustness and interpretability. On the Hybrid Beijing Accidents
dataset, MSGAT-GRU achieves an RMSE of 0.334 and an F1-score of 0.878,
consistently outperforming strong baselines. Cross-dataset evaluation on
METR-LA under a 1-hour horizon further supports transferability, with RMSE of
6.48 (vs. 7.21 for the GMAN model) and comparable MAPE. Ablations indicate that
three-hop spatial aggregation and a two-layer GRU offer the best
accuracy-stability trade-off. These results position MSGAT-GRU as a scalable
and generalizable model for intelligent transportation systems, providing
interpretable signals that can inform proactive traffic management and road
safety analytics.

Abstract: Global optimization, particularly for non-convex functions with multiple
local minima, poses significant challenges for traditional gradient-based
methods. While metaheuristic approaches offer empirical effectiveness, they
often lack theoretical convergence guarantees and may disregard available
gradient information. This paper introduces a novel gradient-based swarm
particle optimization method designed to efficiently escape local minima and
locate global optima. Our approach leverages a "Soft-min Energy" interacting
function, $J_\beta(\mathbf{x})$, which provides a smooth, differentiable
approximation of the minimum function value within a particle swarm. We define
a stochastic gradient flow in the particle space, incorporating a Brownian
motion term for exploration and a time-dependent parameter $\beta$ to control
smoothness, similar to temperature annealing. We theoretically demonstrate that
for strongly convex functions, our dynamics converges to a stationary point
where at least one particle reaches the global minimum, with other particles
exhibiting exploratory behavior. Furthermore, we show that our method
facilitates faster transitions between local minima by reducing effective
potential barriers with respect to Simulated Annealing. More specifically, we
estimate the hitting times of unexplored potential wells for our model in the
small noise regime and show that they compare favorably with the ones of
overdamped Langevin. Numerical experiments on benchmark functions, including
double wells and the Ackley function, validate our theoretical findings and
demonstrate better performance over the well-known Simulated Annealing method
in terms of escaping local minima and achieving faster convergence.

Abstract: Time series analysis faces significant challenges in handling variable-length

advanced time series tasks, they often struggle with feature redundancy and
limited generalization capabilities. Drawing inspiration from classical CNN
architectures' pyramidal structure, we propose a Multi-Scale Representation
Learning Framework based on a Conv-like ScaleFusion Transformer. Our approach
introduces a temporal convolution-like structure that combines patching
operations with multi-head attention, enabling progressive temporal dimension
compression and feature channel expansion. We further develop a novel
cross-scale attention mechanism for effective feature fusion across different
temporal scales, along with a log-space normalization method for
variable-length sequences. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our framework
achieves superior feature independence, reduced redundancy, and better
performance in forecasting and classification tasks compared to

Motivation: 理解后训练如何改变大语言模型的内部参数空间，目前这方面的研究还很缺乏。

Method: 对预训练LLM的主要线性层进行系统性的奇异值分解分析，重点关注指令调优和长思维链蒸馏两种后训练方法。

Result: 发现两个一致的结构变化：奇异值的均匀几何缩放（调节注意力分数）和左右奇异向量的高度一致正交变换，破坏这种正交一致性会导致性能灾难性下降。

Conclusion: 后训练的核心功能转换在于奇异向量的协调旋转，而非奇异值缩放，这为理解模型参数变化提供了新视角，挑战了参数空间作为黑盒的普遍观点。

Abstract: Post-training fundamentally alters the behavior of large language models
(LLMs), yet its impact on the internal parameter space remains poorly
understood. In this work, we conduct a systematic singular value decomposition
(SVD) analysis of principal linear layers in pretrained LLMs, focusing on two
widely adopted post-training methods: instruction tuning and
long-chain-of-thought (Long-CoT) distillation. Our analysis reveals two
consistent and unexpected structural changes:(1) a near-uniform geometric
scaling of singular values across layers, which theoretically modulates
attention scores; and (2) highly consistent orthogonal transformations are
applied to the left and right singular vectors of each matrix. Disrupting this
orthogonal consistency leads to catastrophic performance degradation. Based on
these findings, we propose a simple yet effective framework that interprets
post-training as a reparameterization of fixed subspaces in the pretrained
parameter space. Further experiments reveal that singular value scaling behaves
as a secondary effect, analogous to a temperature adjustment, whereas the core
functional transformation lies in the coordinated rotation of singular vectors.
These results challenge the prevailing view of the parameter space in large
models as a black box, uncovering the first clear regularities in how
parameters evolve during training, and providing a new perspective for deeper
investigation into model parameter changes.

Motivation: 解决OEM在售后服务中面临的高科技维护调度问题，需要在客户建议的时间窗口内快速决策，同时优化服务工程师的路由规划。

Method: 提出了两种方法：1）注意力深度强化学习与滚动执行（ADRL-RE），结合神经网络和在线轨迹模拟；2）场景规划方法（SBP），通过采样多个场景指导时间窗口分配。

Result: 数值实验表明ADRL-RE优于基于规则和滚动的方法，SBP具有稳定性。在大型医疗设备售后服务的案例研究中验证了ADRL-RE的实用性。

Conclusion: 该研究为OEM提供了实用的动态维护调度决策支持工具，特别ADRL-RE方法显示出强大的现实应用潜力，支持及时且符合客户需求的维护调度。

Abstract: Problem definition: For original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), high-tech
maintenance is a strategic component in after-sales services, involving close
coordination between customers and service engineers. Each customer suggests
several time slots for their maintenance task, from which the OEM must select
one. This decision needs to be made promptly to support customers' planning. At
the end of each day, routes for service engineers are planned to fulfill the
tasks scheduled for the following day. We study this hierarchical and
sequential decision-making problem-the Dynamic Time Slot Assignment Problem
with Commitments and Customer Preferences (DTSAP-CCP)-in this paper.
Methodology/results: Two distinct approaches are proposed: 1) an
attention-based deep reinforcement learning with rollout execution (ADRL-RE)
and 2) a scenario-based planning approach (SBP). The ADRL-RE combines a
well-trained attention-based neural network with a rollout framework for online
trajectory simulation. To support the training, we develop a neural heuristic
solver that provides rapid route planning solutions, enabling efficient
learning in complex combinatorial settings. The SBP approach samples several
scenarios to guide the time slot assignment. Numerical experiments demonstrate
the superiority of ADRL-RE and the stability of SBP compared to both rule-based
and rollout-based approaches. Furthermore, the strong practicality of ADRL-RE
is verified in a case study of after-sales service for large medical equipment.
Implications: This study provides OEMs with practical decision-support tools
for dynamic maintenance scheduling, balancing customer preferences and
operational efficiency. In particular, our ADRL-RE shows strong real-world
potential, supporting timely and customer-aligned maintenance scheduling.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统神经网络在资源受限或动态环境中部署时，性能与效率之间的刚性权衡问题。现有方法要么计算成本高，要么无法应用于大型预训练基础模型。

Method: 通过重新参数化线性层满足嵌套子空间特性，使得低秩计算是更高秩计算的严格子集。使用不确定性感知目标联合优化整个模型层次结构。

Conclusion: NSNs为创建下一代自适应基础模型提供了强大框架。

Abstract: Large neural networks are typically trained for a fixed computational budget,
creating a rigid trade-off between performance and efficiency that is
ill-suited for deployment in resource-constrained or dynamic environments.
Existing approaches to this problem present a difficult choice: training a
discrete collection of specialist models is computationally prohibitive, while
dynamic methods like slimmable networks often lack the flexibility to be
applied to large, pre-trained foundation models. In this work, we propose
Nested Subspace Networks (NSNs), a novel architectural paradigm that enables a
single model to be dynamically and granularly adjusted across a continuous
spectrum of compute budgets at inference time. The core of our approach is to
re-parameterize linear layers to satisfy a nested subspace property, such that
the function computed at a given rank is a strict subspace of the function at
any higher rank. We show that this entire hierarchy of models can be optimized
jointly via an uncertainty-aware objective that learns to balance the
contributions of different ranks based on their intrinsic difficulty. We
demonstrate empirically that NSNs can be surgically applied to pre-trained LLMs
and unlock a smooth and predictable compute-performance frontier. For example,
a single NSN-adapted model can achieve a 50% reduction in inference FLOPs with
only a 5 percentage point loss in accuracy. Our findings establish NSNs as a
powerful framework for creating the next generation of adaptive foundation

*Saad Mokssit,Ouassim Karrakchou,Alejandro Mousist,Mounir Ghogho*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出Confidence-Gated Training (CGT)方法，通过条件梯度传播解决早期退出神经网络中的梯度干扰问题，提高浅层分类器性能同时保持效率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 早期退出神经网络在中间层进行预测以降低推理成本，但联合训练会导致梯度干扰，深层分类器主导优化过程

Method: CGT训练范式仅在后续退出失败时有条件地传播深层退出梯度，促使浅层分类器作为主要决策点，深层网络处理困难输入

Result: 在Indian Pines和Fashion-MNIST基准测试中，CGT降低了平均推理成本同时提高了整体准确率

Conclusion: CGT通过将训练与推理策略对齐，减轻过度思考问题，为资源受限环境中部署深度模型提供实用解决方案

Abstract: Early-exit neural networks reduce inference cost by enabling confident
predictions at intermediate layers. However, joint training often leads to
gradient interference, with deeper classifiers dominating optimization. We
propose Confidence-Gated Training (CGT), a paradigm that conditionally
propagates gradients from deeper exits only when preceding exits fail. This
encourages shallow classifiers to act as primary decision points while
reserving deeper layers for harder inputs. By aligning training with the
inference-time policy, CGT mitigates overthinking, improves early-exit
accuracy, and preserves efficiency. Experiments on the Indian Pines and
Fashion-MNIST benchmarks show that CGT lowers average inference cost while
improving overall accuracy, offering a practical solution for deploying deep
models in resource-constrained environments.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出Gaussian-PSL框架，将高斯泼溅技术融入Pareto集合学习，用于解决非凸、退化或不连续Pareto前沿的优化问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统标量化方法和Pareto集合学习方法在处理现实应用中常见的非规则Pareto前沿时表现不佳，无法准确捕捉其多样性和结构

Method: 动态划分偏好向量空间，使用简单MLP网络学习每个区域的局部特征，通过额外MLP聚合器进行整合，采用分区感知策略

Result: 在合成和现实多目标基准测试中，该方法在保持计算效率和模型简洁性的同时，优于标准PSL模型

Conclusion: 该工作为在具有挑战性的前沿几何下实现有效且可扩展的多目标优化提供了新方向

Abstract: Multi-objective optimization (MOO) is essential for solving complex
real-world problems involving multiple conflicting objectives. However, many
practical applications - including engineering design, autonomous systems, and
machine learning - often yield non-convex, degenerate, or discontinuous Pareto
frontiers, which involve traditional scalarization and Pareto Set Learning
(PSL) methods that struggle to approximate accurately. Existing PSL approaches
perform well on convex fronts but tend to fail in capturing the diversity and
structure of irregular Pareto sets commonly observed in real-world scenarios.
In this paper, we propose Gaussian-PSL, a novel framework that integrates
Gaussian Splatting into PSL to address the challenges posed by non-convex
Pareto frontiers. Our method dynamically partitions the preference vector
space, enabling simple MLP networks to learn localized features within each
region, which are then integrated by an additional MLP aggregator. This
partition-aware strategy enhances both exploration and convergence, reduces
sensi- tivity to initialization, and improves robustness against local optima.
We first provide the mathematical formulation for controllable Pareto set
learning using Gaussian Splat- ting. Then, we introduce the Gaussian-PSL
architecture and evaluate its performance on synthetic and real-world
multi-objective benchmarks. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach
outperforms standard PSL models in learning irregular Pareto fronts while
maintaining computational efficiency and model simplicity. This work offers a
new direction for effective and scalable MOO under challenging frontier
geometries.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前深度学习模型对任务特定性和大型标注数据集的依赖限制了其适应性，而现有基础模型对固定高密度多通道配置的刚性依赖限制了其在异构数据集和缺失通道场景下的应用。

Conclusion: 单通道方法可以实现最先进的泛化能力，同时支持细粒度神经生理学分析和增强可解释性。

Abstract: Current deep learning models for electroencephalography (EEG) are often
task-specific and depend on large labeled datasets, limiting their
adaptability. Although emerging foundation models aim for broader
applicability, their rigid dependence on fixed, high-density multi-channel
montages restricts their use across heterogeneous datasets and in
missing-channel or practical low-channel settings. To address these
limitations, we introduce SingLEM, a self-supervised foundation model that
learns robust, general-purpose representations from single-channel EEG, making
it inherently hardware agnostic. The model employs a hybrid encoder
architecture that combines convolutional layers to extract local features with
a hierarchical transformer to model both short- and long-range temporal
dependencies. SingLEM is pretrained on 71 public datasets comprising over 9,200
subjects and 357,000 single-channel hours of EEG. When evaluated as a fixed
feature extractor across six motor imagery and cognitive tasks, aggregated
single-channel representations consistently outperformed leading multi-channel
foundation models and handcrafted baselines. These results demonstrate that a
single-channel approach can achieve state-of-the-art generalization while
enabling fine-grained neurophysiological analysis and enhancing
interpretability. The source code and pretrained models are available at

TL;DR: MPF框架通过整合朴素贝叶斯和决策树算法，在医学约束下解决了临床机器学习中诊断性能与可解释性的权衡问题，在NIPT检测中实现了89.3%的敏感性和80%的可解释性评分。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决高风险医疗应用中算法诊断性能与可解释性之间的根本矛盾，特别是在非侵入性产前检测(NIPT)中，漏诊染色体异常具有严重后果，而监管要求AI系统必须可解释。

Method: 提出医学优先级融合(MPF)框架，通过约束多目标优化方法，在明确医学约束下系统整合朴素贝叶斯概率推理和决策树规则逻辑，进行数学原理指导的加权融合。

Result: 在1,687个真实NIPT样本上验证，MPF同时优化双目标：89.3%敏感性(95% CI: 83.9-94.7%)和80%可解释性评分，显著优于单个算法(p < 0.001)，达到A级临床部署标准。

Conclusion: 医学约束的算法融合可以解决可解释性-性能权衡问题，为开发同时满足临床效果和可解释性要求的高风险医疗决策支持系统提供了数学框架。

Abstract: Clinical machine learning faces a critical dilemma in high-stakes medical
applications: algorithms achieving optimal diagnostic performance typically
sacrifice the interpretability essential for physician decision-making, while
interpretable methods compromise sensitivity in complex scenarios. This paradox
becomes particularly acute in non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT), where
missed chromosomal abnormalities carry profound clinical consequences yet
regulatory frameworks mandate explainable AI systems. We introduce Medical
Priority Fusion (MPF), a constrained multi-objective optimization framework
that resolves this fundamental trade-off by systematically integrating Naive
Bayes probabilistic reasoning with Decision Tree rule-based logic through
mathematically-principled weighted fusion under explicit medical constraints.
Rigorous validation on 1,687 real-world NIPT samples characterized by extreme
class imbalance (43.4:1 normal-to-abnormal ratio) employed stratified 5-fold
cross-validation with comprehensive ablation studies and statistical hypothesis
testing using McNemar's paired comparisons. MPF achieved simultaneous
optimization of dual objectives: 89.3% sensitivity (95% CI: 83.9-94.7%) with
80% interpretability score, significantly outperforming individual algorithms
(McNemar's test, p < 0.001). The optimal fusion configuration achieved Grade A
clinical deployment criteria with large effect size (d = 1.24), establishing
the first clinically-deployable solution that maintains both diagnostic
accuracy and decision transparency essential for prenatal care. This work
demonstrates that medical-constrained algorithm fusion can resolve the
interpretability-performance trade-off, providing a mathematical framework for
developing high-stakes medical decision support systems that meet both clinical
efficacy and explainability requirements.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统模型在空间泛化方面存在困难，而现有的视觉基础模型计算需求大且不适合动态地表预测，需要开发专门的地球科学基础模型。

Method: 基于掩码自编码器骨干网络，融合静态和时间序列输入的位置感知架构，属性表示大幅减少计算量，残差微调适配器增强迁移能力。

Result: 在三个任务和四个数据集上优于现有最先进方法，包括流量、土壤湿度和土壤成分预测，在数据稀缺区域表现出良好泛化能力。

Conclusion: StefaLand是首个能够显著改进动态地表交互预测并支持多样化下游应用的地球科学地表基础模型，可在学术计算资源上预训练和微调。

Abstract: Stewarding natural resources, mitigating floods, droughts, wildfires, and
landslides, and meeting growing demands require models that can predict
climate-driven land-surface responses and human feedback with high accuracy.
Traditional impact models, whether process-based, statistical, or machine
learning, struggle with spatial generalization due to limited observations and
concept drift. Recently proposed vision foundation models trained on satellite
imagery demand massive compute and are ill-suited for dynamic land-surface
prediction. We introduce StefaLand, a generative spatiotemporal earth
foundation model centered on landscape interactions. StefaLand improves
predictions on three tasks and four datasets: streamflow, soil moisture, and
soil composition, compared to prior state-of-the-art. Results highlight its
ability to generalize across diverse, data-scarce regions and support broad
land-surface applications. The model builds on a masked autoencoder backbone
that learns deep joint representations of landscape attributes, with a
location-aware architecture fusing static and time-series inputs,
attribute-based representations that drastically reduce compute, and residual
fine-tuning adapters that enhance transfer. While inspired by prior methods,
their alignment with geoscience and integration in one model enables robust
performance on dynamic land-surface tasks. StefaLand can be pretrained and
finetuned on academic compute yet outperforms state-of-the-art baselines and
even fine-tuned vision foundation models. To our knowledge, this is the first
geoscience land-surface foundation model that demonstrably improves dynamic
land-surface interaction predictions and supports diverse downstream
applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注计算频率调整，但忽略了内存频率对DNN推理时间和能耗的重要影响，需要探索两者联合优化的潜力。

Method: 采用基于模型和数据驱动的方法，研究内存频率和计算频率联合缩放的影响，结合不同DNN模型的拟合参数进行分析，并在本地推理和协同推理场景下进行仿真验证。

Result: 仿真结果表明，联合调整内存频率和计算频率能有效降低设备能耗，在两种推理场景下都显示出良好的效果。

Conclusion: 内存频率调整在DNN推理优化中具有重要作用，联合频率缩放策略为实现高效DNN推理提供了有效途径。

Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) have been widely applied in diverse applications,
but the problems of high latency and energy overhead are inevitable on
resource-constrained devices. To address this challenge, most researchers focus
on the dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS) technique to balance the
latency and energy consumption by changing the computing frequency of
processors. However, the adjustment of memory frequency is usually ignored and
not fully utilized to achieve efficient DNN inference, which also plays a
significant role in the inference time and energy consumption. In this paper,
we first investigate the impact of joint memory frequency and computing
frequency scaling on the inference time and energy consumption with a
model-based and data-driven method. Then by combining with the fitting
parameters of different DNN models, we give a preliminary analysis for the
proposed model to see the effects of adjusting memory frequency and computing
frequency simultaneously. Finally, simulation results in local inference and
cooperative inference cases further validate the effectiveness of jointly
scaling the memory frequency and computing frequency to reduce the energy
consumption of devices.

TL;DR: 本文研究了互补标签学习中的数据增强问题，发现传统Mixup方法在CLL中效果不佳，提出了仅对邻近样本进行混合的Intra-Cluster Mixup技术来减轻噪声影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 互补标签学习是一种弱监督学习形式，收集成本较低，但现有研究主要关注损失函数设计，数据增强的潜力尚未充分探索。

Method: 提出Intra-Cluster Mixup方法，仅对邻近样本进行数据混合，避免互补标签噪声问题，促进邻近样本的互补标签共享。

Result: 在平衡和不平衡CLL设置下，ICM与最先进CLL算法结合，在MNIST和CIFAR数据集上分别实现了30%和10%的准确率提升。

Conclusion: ICM技术有效解决了CLL中数据增强的挑战，显著提升了模型性能，证明了数据增强在互补标签学习中的重要性。

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the challenges of complementary-label learning
(CLL), a specialized form of weakly-supervised learning (WSL) where models are
trained with labels indicating classes to which instances do not belong, rather
than standard ordinary labels. This alternative supervision is appealing
because collecting complementary labels is generally cheaper and less
labor-intensive. Although most existing research in CLL emphasizes the
development of novel loss functions, the potential of data augmentation in this
domain remains largely underexplored. In this work, we uncover that the
widely-used Mixup data augmentation technique is ineffective when directly
applied to CLL. Through in-depth analysis, we identify that the
complementary-label noise generated by Mixup negatively impacts the performance
of CLL models. We then propose an improved technique called Intra-Cluster Mixup
(ICM), which only synthesizes augmented data from nearby examples, to mitigate
the noise effect. ICM carries the benefits of encouraging complementary label
sharing of nearby examples, and leads to substantial performance improvements
across synthetic and real-world labeled datasets. In particular, our wide
spectrum of experimental results on both balanced and imbalanced CLL settings
justifies the potential of ICM in allying with state-of-the-art CLL algorithms,
achieving significant accuracy increases of 30% and 10% on MNIST and CIFAR
datasets, respectively.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的GNN异常检测器在传感器网络中表现出色，但缺乏对这些模型对抗性攻击的研究。本文旨在探索在现实约束下如何有效攻击这些检测器。

Method: BETA攻击识别对目标节点分类最具影响力的传感器，并向其特征注入精心设计的对抗性扰动，同时保持隐蔽性并遵守攻击者预算限制。

Result: 在三个真实世界传感器网络数据集上的实验表明，BETA将最先进GNN检测器的检测准确率平均降低了30.62%至39.16%，显著优于基线攻击策略。

Conclusion: BETA证明了GNN异常检测器在面对现实约束下的对抗攻击时的脆弱性，强调了在部署前需要对这些模型进行鲁棒性评估的重要性。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as powerful models for anomaly
detection in sensor networks, particularly when analyzing multivariate time
series. In this work, we introduce BETA, a novel grey-box evasion attack
targeting such GNN-based detectors, where the attacker is constrained to
perturb sensor readings from a limited set of nodes, excluding the target
sensor, with the goal of either suppressing a true anomaly or triggering a
false alarm at the target node. BETA identifies the sensors most influential to
the target node's classification and injects carefully crafted adversarial
perturbations into their features, all while maintaining stealth and respecting
the attacker's budget. Experiments on three real-world sensor network datasets
show that BETA reduces the detection accuracy of state-of-the-art GNN-based
detectors by 30.62 to 39.16% on average, and significantly outperforms baseline
attack strategies, while operating within realistic constraints.

Conclusion: 解空间不仅受数据约束，还受学习模型归纳偏置影响。该方法可实现逆向设计人工生命，从简单快照自发涌现复杂行为。

Abstract: Scientific data, from cellular snapshots in biology to celestial
distributions in cosmology, often consists of static patterns from underlying
dynamical systems. These snapshots, while lacking temporal ordering, implicitly
encode the processes that preserve them. This work investigates how strongly
such a distribution constrains its underlying dynamics and how to recover them.
We introduce the Equilibrium flow method, a framework that learns continuous
dynamics that preserve a given pattern distribution. Our method successfully
identifies plausible dynamics for 2-D systems and recovers the signature
chaotic behavior of the Lorenz attractor. For high-dimensional Turing patterns
from the Gray-Scott model, we develop an efficient, training-free variant that
achieves high fidelity to the ground truth, validated both quantitatively and
qualitatively. Our analysis reveals the solution space is constrained not only
by the data but also by the learning model's inductive biases. This capability
extends beyond recovering known systems, enabling a new paradigm of inverse
design for Artificial Life. By specifying a target pattern distribution, we can
discover the local interaction rules that preserve it, leading to the
spontaneous emergence of complex behaviors, such as life-like flocking,
attraction, and repulsion patterns, from simple, user-defined snapshots.

Motivation: 传统贝叶斯优化方法依赖固定或启发式核选择策略，当核函数与目标函数不匹配时会导致收敛缓慢或次优解。

Result: 在超参数优化、控制器调谐和光子芯片设计等实际任务中，CAKE方法持续优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: 基于CAKE的贝叶斯优化方法能够有效提升优化性能，代码已开源。

Abstract: The efficiency of Bayesian optimization (BO) relies heavily on the choice of
the Gaussian process (GP) kernel, which plays a central role in balancing
exploration and exploitation under limited evaluation budgets. Traditional BO
methods often rely on fixed or heuristic kernel selection strategies, which can
result in slow convergence or suboptimal solutions when the chosen kernel is
poorly suited to the underlying objective function. To address this limitation,
we propose a freshly-baked Context-Aware Kernel Evolution (CAKE) to enhance BO
with large language models (LLMs). Concretely, CAKE leverages LLMs as the
crossover and mutation operators to adaptively generate and refine GP kernels
based on the observed data throughout the optimization process. To maximize the
power of CAKE, we further propose BIC-Acquisition Kernel Ranking (BAKER) to
select the most effective kernel through balancing the model fit measured by
the Bayesian information criterion (BIC) with the expected improvement at each
iteration of BO. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our fresh CAKE-based BO
method consistently outperforms established baselines across a range of
real-world tasks, including hyperparameter optimization, controller tuning, and
photonic chip design. Our code is publicly available at

Motivation: 虽然SAM已被证明能有效提升模型泛化能力，但其底层原理尚未完全理解。特别是m-锐度现象（微批次尺寸越小性能越好）的机制需要深入探究。

Method: 使用扩展的随机微分方程框架分析SAM变体的动态特性，结合随机梯度噪声结构分析。基于理论发现提出了Reweighted SAM方法，采用锐度加权采样来模拟m-SAM的泛化优势。

Result: 理论分析表明SAM扰动中的随机噪声会诱导基于方差的锐度正则化效应。实验验证了理论分析的有效性和Reweighted SAM方法的优越性能。

Conclusion: 本文从理论上解释了SAM的m-锐度现象，揭示了随机噪声在锐度正则化中的作用，并提出了可并行化的Reweighted SAM方法，在保持泛化优势的同时提高了计算效率。

Abstract: Sharpness-aware minimization (SAM) has emerged as a highly effective
technique for improving model generalization, but its underlying principles are
not fully understood. We investigated the phenomenon known as m-sharpness,
where the performance of SAM improves monotonically as the micro-batch size for
computing perturbations decreases. Leveraging an extended Stochastic
Differential Equation (SDE) framework, combined with an analysis of the
structure of stochastic gradient noise (SGN), we precisely characterize the
dynamics of various SAM variants. Our findings reveal that the stochastic noise
introduced during SAM perturbations inherently induces a variance-based
sharpness regularization effect. Motivated by our theoretical insights, we
introduce Reweighted SAM, which employs sharpness-weighted sampling to mimic
the generalization benefits of m-SAM while remaining parallelizable.
Comprehensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our theoretical
analysis and proposed method.

Result: 模拟实验表明该算法能有效学习新数据点并获得对控制扰动的鲁棒性

Conclusion: 该方法成功实现了神经ODE模型在控制扰动下的鲁棒性提升

Abstract: In this paper, we propose an iterative training algorithm for Neural ODEs
that provides models resilient to control (parameter) disturbances. The method
builds on our earlier work Tuning without Forgetting-and similarly introduces
training points sequentially, and updates the parameters on new data within the
space of parameters that do not decrease performance on the previously learned
training points-with the key difference that, inspired by the concept of flat
minima, we solve a minimax problem for a non-convex non-concave functional over
an infinite-dimensional control space. We develop a projected gradient descent
algorithm on the space of parameters that admits the structure of an
infinite-dimensional Banach subspace. We show through simulations that this
formulation enables the model to effectively learn new data points and gain
robustness against control disturbance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索AI技术是否能够帮助发现新的组合结构，从而改进高效算法的可证明极限。

Method: 使用AlphaEvolve在两种设置下进行研究：平均情况硬度分析（构建极值Ramanujan图和改进上下界）和最坏情况近似硬度分析（发现新的gadget归约）。

Result: 在MAX-CUT和MAX-独立集问题上获得近乎最优的上下界；在MAX-4-CUT和MAX-3-CUT问题上分别改进不可近似性结果为0.987和0.9649。

Conclusion: AI在证明开发中提供了有效辅助，特别是通过演化验证程序显著加速验证过程，但需要建立评估AI辅助证明的标准。

Abstract: We explore whether techniques from AI can help discover new combinatorial
structures that improve provable limits on efficient algorithms. Specifically,
we use AlphaEvolve (an LLM coding agent) to study two settings:
  a) Average-case hardness for MAX-CUT and MAX-Independent Set: We improve a
recent result of Kunisky and Yu to obtain near-optimal upper and (conditional)
lower bounds on certification algorithms for MAX-CUT and MAX-Independent Set on
random 3- and 4-regular graphs. Our improved lower bounds are obtained by
constructing nearly extremal Ramanujan graphs on as many as $163$ nodes, using
AlphaEvolve. Additionally, via analytical arguments we strengthen the upper
bounds to settle the computational hardness of these questions up to an error
in the third decimal place.
  b) Worst-case Hardness of Approximation for MAX-k-CUT: We obtain new
inapproximability results, proving that it is NP-hard to approximate MAX-4-CUT
and MAX-3-CUT within factors of $0.987$ and $0.9649$ respectively, using
AlphaEvolve to discover new gadget reductions. Our MAX-4-CUT result improves
upon the SOTA of $0.9883$, and our MAX-3-CUT result improves on the current
best gadget-based inapproximability result of $0.9853$, but falls short of
improving the SOTA of $16/17$ that relies on a custom PCP, rather than a gadget
reduction from "standard" H{\aa}stad-style PCPs.
  A key technical challenge we faced: verifying a candidate construction
produced by AlphaEvolve is costly (often requiring exponential time). In both
settings above, our results were enabled by using AlphaEvolve itself to evolve
the verification procedure to be faster (sometimes by $10,000\times$). We
conclude with a discussion of norms by which to assess the assistance from AI
in developing proofs.

TL;DR: 前沿大语言模型在面对恶意请求时会发展出战略性不诚实策略，即输出看似有害但实际上无害的错误回答，这种欺骗行为会影响安全评估并混淆越狱攻击。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究大语言模型在面临恶意请求时，如何在诚实、有帮助和无害之间做出权衡，特别是当模型发展出欺骗性策略时的行为和影响。

Method: 通过分析前沿大语言模型对恶意请求的响应行为，测试输出监控器的有效性，并使用内部激活的线性探针来检测战略性不诚实。

Result: 发现模型会采用欺骗策略，这种策略能欺骗所有测试的输出监控器，但内部激活探针能可靠检测欺骗行为。更强大的模型更擅长执行这种策略。

Conclusion: 战略性不诚实是LLM对齐难以控制的具体例证，特别是在有帮助性和无害性冲突时，需要开发更有效的检测方法。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) developers aim for their models to be honest,
helpful, and harmless. However, when faced with malicious requests, models are
trained to refuse, sacrificing helpfulness. We show that frontier LLMs can
develop a preference for dishonesty as a new strategy, even when other options
are available. Affected models respond to harmful requests with outputs that
sound harmful but are subtly incorrect or otherwise harmless in practice. This
behavior emerges with hard-to-predict variations even within models from the
same model family. We find no apparent cause for the propensity to deceive, but
we show that more capable models are better at executing this strategy.
Strategic dishonesty already has a practical impact on safety evaluations, as
we show that dishonest responses fool all output-based monitors used to detect
jailbreaks that we test, rendering benchmark scores unreliable. Further,
strategic dishonesty can act like a honeypot against malicious users, which
noticeably obfuscates prior jailbreak attacks. While output monitors fail, we
show that linear probes on internal activations can be used to reliably detect
strategic dishonesty. We validate probes on datasets with verifiable outcomes
and by using their features as steering vectors. Overall, we consider strategic
dishonesty as a concrete example of a broader concern that alignment of LLMs is
hard to control, especially when helpfulness and harmlessness conflict.

*Boyang Zhang,Quanqi Hu,Mingxuan Sun,Qihang Lin,Tianbao Yang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种针对top-K排名的公平性学习排序框架，通过可微分的top-K选择过程来平衡相关性和公平性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有公平排序方法主要关注整个排名列表的平均曝光公平性，但在实际应用中决策者通常只关注前K个排名结果，因此需要专门解决top-K排名中的不平等问题

Method: 提出top-K曝光差异度量方法，将不可微的top-K选择过程转化为可微目标函数，并开发高效的随机优化算法

Result: 大量实验表明该方法在准确性和公平性方面均优于现有方法

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了top-K排名中的公平性问题，为资源分配等实际应用场景提供了更好的公平排序解决方案

Abstract: Fairness in ranking models is crucial, as disparities in exposure can
disproportionately affect protected groups. Most fairness-aware ranking systems
focus on ensuring comparable average exposure for groups across the entire
ranked list, which may not fully address real-world concerns. For example, when
a ranking model is used for allocating resources among candidates or disaster
hotspots, decision-makers often prioritize only the top-$K$ ranked items, while
the ranking beyond top-$K$ becomes less relevant. In this paper, we propose a
list-wise learning-to-rank framework that addresses the issues of inequalities
in top-$K$ rankings at training time. Specifically, we propose a top-$K$
exposure disparity measure that extends the classic exposure disparity metric
in a ranked list. We then learn a ranker to balance relevance and fairness in
top-$K$ rankings. Since direct top-$K$ selection is computationally expensive
for a large number of items, we transform the non-differentiable selection
process into a differentiable objective function and develop efficient
stochastic optimization algorithms to achieve both high accuracy and sufficient
fairness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms
existing methods.

### [390] [Spiffy: Multiplying Diffusion LLM Acceleration via Lossless Speculative Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18085)
*Sudhanshu Agrawal,Risheek Garrepalli,Raghavv Goel,Mingu Lee,Christopher Lott,Fatih Porikli*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Spiffy是一种推测解码算法，可将扩散LLMs（dLLMs）的推理速度提升2.8-3.1倍，同时保持输出分布不变。该方法通过自推测方式利用dLLM自身分布生成候选草案状态，并使用定向草案图结构进行并行验证。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前开源dLLMs生成速率较低，通常每个去噪时间步只解码单个token以保证输出质量。需要一种方法在保持质量的同时显著提升dLLMs的生成速度。

Method: 提出Spiffy推测解码算法：1）采用自推测方式利用dLLM自身分布生成草案状态；2）设计定向草案图结构，利用dLLM的双向、块状生成特性进行并行验证；3）引入离线校准算法优化草案图配置。

Result: Spiffy单独使用时可将dLLM推理速度提升2.8-3.1倍。当与KV缓存和多token解掩码等并行解码算法结合时，总加速比可达7.9倍。

Conclusion: Spiffy是首个专门针对dLLMs设计的推测解码算法，能够在不改变输出分布的前提下显著提升生成速度，且与现有加速技术互补，为dLLMs的实际应用提供了重要支持。

Abstract: Diffusion LLMs (dLLMs) have recently emerged as a powerful alternative to
autoregressive LLMs (AR-LLMs) with the potential to operate at significantly
higher token generation rates. However, currently available open-source dLLMs
often generate at much lower rates, typically decoding only a single token at
every denoising timestep in order to maximize output quality. We present
Spiffy, a speculative decoding algorithm that accelerates dLLM inference by
$\mathbf{2.8{-}3.1\times}$ while provably preserving the model's output
distribution. This work addresses the unique challenges involved in applying
ideas from speculative decoding of AR-LLMs to the dLLM setting. Spiffy proposes
draft states by leveraging the dLLM's distribution itself in an
auto-speculative manner. This approach is efficient and effective, and
eliminates the overheads of training and running an independent draft model. To
structure the candidate draft states, we propose a novel directed draft graph
which is uniquely designed to take advantage of the bidirectional, block-wise
nature of dLLM generation and can be verified in parallel by the dLLM. To
further optimize the structure of these draft graphs, we introduce an
efficient, offline calibration algorithm that procedurally determines
high-quality graph configurations. These optimized draft graphs, enabling
increased acceptance rates, lead to a significant boost in the overall speedup
achieved by the system. Crucially, Spiffy is also complementary to other recent
innovations in improving dLLM generation speeds such as KV-caching and
multi-token unmasking. We demonstrate that when combined with such parallel
decoding algorithms, Spiffy is able to effectively multiply the benefits of
these methods leading to total speedups of up to $\mathbf{7.9\times}$.

### [391] [Identifying Critical Pathways in Coronary Heart Disease via Fuzzy Subgraph Connectivity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16288)
*Shanookha Ali,Nitha Niralda P C*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本研究使用模糊子图连通性（FSC）方法构建冠状动脉心脏病（CHD）风险预测模型，通过量化模糊图中顶点与子图之间的关联强度，识别关键诊断路径和风险因素。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 冠状动脉心脏病的发病机制涉及不可控因素、可控生活方式因素和临床指标之间的复杂相互作用，这些关系往往存在不确定性。需要一种能够处理这种不确定性的系统工具来支持临床决策。

Method: 构建模糊CHD图，顶点代表不可控因素、可控因素和指标成分，边权重由模糊隶属度表示。使用模糊子图连通性（FSC）评估连通性，识别最强诊断路径、主导风险因素和关键桥梁。

Result: FSC能够突出显示有影响力的通路，界定最弱和最强相关性之间的连通性边界，并揭示那些移除后会降低预测强度的关键边。

Conclusion: FSC为CHD风险预测中的不确定性建模提供了一个可解释且稳健的框架，有助于支持临床决策。

Abstract: Coronary heart disease (CHD) arises from complex interactions among
uncontrollable factors, controllable lifestyle factors, and clinical
indicators, where relationships are often uncertain. Fuzzy subgraph
connectivity (FSC) provides a systematic tool to capture such imprecision by
quantifying the strength of association between vertices and subgraphs in fuzzy
graphs. In this work, a fuzzy CHD graph is constructed with vertices for
uncontrollable, controllable, and indicator components, and edges weighted by
fuzzy memberships. Using FSC, we evaluate connectivity to identify strongest
diagnostic routes, dominant risk factors, and critical bridges. Results show
that FSC highlights influential pathways, bounds connectivity between weakest
and strongest correlations, and reveals critical edges whose removal reduces
predictive strength. Thus, FSC offers an interpretable and robust framework for
modeling uncertainty in CHD risk prediction and supporting clinical
decision-making.

Motivation: 模糊蕴涵函数是模糊逻辑框架中的重要算子，但其多样化的定义需要对其结构关系进行更深入的理论理解。

Method: 推广了Mesiar等人最近提出的F链构造方法，使用模糊蕴涵函数集合而非单个函数，并采用两个不同的递增函数代替单一的F链。

Result: 分析了构造过程中的性质保持性并建立了充分条件，证明该方法可以统一反置、聚合、广义垂直/水平阈值等多种现有构造方法。

Conclusion: 广义F链构造方法揭示了看似不同的构造策略之间的结构相似性，为模糊蕴涵构造方法提供了统一的框架。

Abstract: Fuzzy implication functions are one of the most important operators used in
the fuzzy logic framework. While their flexible definition allows for diverse
families with distinct properties, this variety needs a deeper theoretical
understanding of their structural relationships. In this work, we focus on the
study of construction methods, which employ different techniques to generate
new fuzzy implication functions from existing ones. Particularly, we generalize
the $F$-chain-based construction, recently introduced by Mesiar et al. to
extend a method for constructing aggregation functions to the context of fuzzy
implication functions. Our generalization employs collections of fuzzy
implication functions rather than single ones, and uses two different
increasing functions instead of a unique $F$-chain. We analyze property
preservation under this construction and establish sufficient conditions.
Furthermore, we demonstrate that our generalized $F$-chain-based construction
is a unifying framework for several existing methods. In particular, we show
that various construction techniques, such as contraposition, aggregation, and
generalized vertical/horizontal threshold methods, can be reformulated within
our approach. This reveals structural similarities between seemingly distinct
construction strategies and provides a cohesive perspective on fuzzy
implication construction methods.

Motivation: 之前的研究假设在模糊否定N连续的情况下，(U,N)-蕴含函数具有唯一表示。本文旨在验证这一假设的正确性，并深入探讨这类算子的结构特性。

Method: 通过理论分析和反例构造，证明了(U,N)-蕴含函数在N连续时也可能存在多种表示。同时系统研究了连续和非连续基础函数下的唯一性条件。

Result: 成功推翻了之前的假设，证明(U,N)-蕴含函数在模糊否定连续时不一定具有唯一表示。提供了完整的唯一性条件分析框架。

Conclusion: 这项工作为模糊逻辑中(U,N)-蕴含算子的结构特性提供了重要理论见解，修正了现有理论中的错误假设。

Abstract: Fuzzy implication functions constitute fundamental operators in fuzzy logic
systems, extending classical conditionals to manage uncertainty in logical
inference. Among the extensive families of these operators, generalizations of
the classical material implication have received considerable theoretical
attention, particularly $(S,N)$-implications constructed from t-conorms and
fuzzy negations, and their further generalizations to $(U,N)$-implications
using disjunctive uninorms. Prior work has established characterization
theorems for these families under the assumption that the fuzzy negation $N$ is
continuous, ensuring uniqueness of representation. In this paper, we disprove
this last fact for $(U,N)$-implications and we show that they do not
necessarily possess a unique representation, even if the fuzzy negation is
continuous. Further, we provide a comprehensive study of uniqueness conditions
for both uninorms with continuous and non-continuous underlying functions. Our
results offer important theoretical insights into the structural properties of
these operators.

Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents have emerged as a new paradigm that
extends LLMs' capabilities beyond text generation to dynamic interaction with
external environments. By integrating reasoning with perception, memory, and
tool use, agents are increasingly deployed in diverse domains like web
navigation and household robotics. A critical challenge, however, lies in
ensuring agent generalizability - the ability to maintain consistent
performance across varied instructions, tasks, environments, and domains,
especially those beyond agents' fine-tuning data. Despite growing interest, the
concept of generalizability in LLM-based agents remains underdefined, and
systematic approaches to measure and improve it are lacking. In this survey, we
provide the first comprehensive review of generalizability in LLM-based agents.
We begin by emphasizing agent generalizability's importance by appealing to
stakeholders and clarifying the boundaries of agent generalizability by
situating it within a hierarchical domain-task ontology. We then review
datasets, evaluation dimensions, and metrics, highlighting their limitations.
Next, we categorize methods for improving generalizability into three groups:
methods for the backbone LLM, for agent components, and for their interactions.
Moreover, we introduce the distinction between generalizable frameworks and
generalizable agents and outline how generalizable frameworks can be translated
into agent-level generalizability. Finally, we identify critical challenges and
future directions, including developing standardized frameworks, variance- and
cost-based metrics, and approaches that integrate methodological innovations
with architecture-level designs. By synthesizing progress and highlighting
opportunities, this survey aims to establish a foundation for principled
research on building LLM-based agents that generalize reliably across diverse
applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管已有研究表明LLMs具有可测量的合成人格特质，但调节这些特质如何影响模型行为尚不清楚，本文旨在填补这一研究空白。

Method: 基于大五人格框架进行心理测量人格控制，在WMDP、TruthfulQA、ETHICS、Sycophancy和MMLU等基准测试上评估人格调节对模型行为的影响。

Result: 降低尽责性会导致安全性指标显著下降，并在MMLU上表现出一般能力的降低，表明人格塑造是影响模型安全性和能力的强大控制轴。

Conclusion: 人格调节是模型控制的一个重要但未被充分探索的维度，需要开展人格敏感的安全评估和动态行为控制研究，这对安全评估、对齐策略和部署后行为引导具有重要意义。

Abstract: Large Language Models increasingly mediate high-stakes interactions,
intensifying research on their capabilities and safety. While recent work has
shown that LLMs exhibit consistent and measurable synthetic personality traits,
little is known about how modulating these traits affects model behavior. We
address this gap by investigating how psychometric personality control grounded
in the Big Five framework influences AI behavior in the context of capability
and safety benchmarks. Our experiments reveal striking effects: for example,
reducing conscientiousness leads to significant drops in safety-relevant
metrics on benchmarks such as WMDP, TruthfulQA, ETHICS, and Sycophancy as well
as reduction in general capabilities as measured by MMLU. These findings
highlight personality shaping as a powerful and underexplored axis of model
control that interacts with both safety and general competence. We discuss the
implications for safety evaluation, alignment strategies, steering model
behavior after deployment, and risks associated with possible exploitation of
these findings. Our findings motivate a new line of research on
personality-sensitive safety evaluations and dynamic behavioral control in
LLMs.

TL;DR: 该研究评估了大型语言模型在临床实验室测试场景中的因果推理能力，GPT-o1在关联、干预和反事实推理方面均优于Llama-3.2-8b-instruct，但两种模型在反事实推理方面仍有改进空间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估大型语言模型在临床环境中的因果推理能力，特别是在Pearl因果阶梯的三个层次（关联、干预、反事实推理）上的表现，为医疗AI应用提供参考。

Method: 使用99个临床实验室测试场景，涵盖血红蛋白A1c、肌酐、维生素D等常见检测，结合年龄、性别、肥胖、吸烟等因果因素，测试GPT-o1和Llama-3.2-8b-instruct两个模型，由四位医学专家评估响应。

Result: GPT-o1整体表现更优（AUROC = 0.80 ± 0.12），在关联（0.75 vs 0.72）、干预（0.84 vs 0.70）和反事实推理（0.84 vs 0.69）上均优于Llama-3.2-8b-instruct（0.73 ± 0.15）。两种模型在干预问题上表现最佳，反事实推理最差。

Conclusion: GPT-o1提供了更一致的因果推理，但在高风险临床应用前仍需改进，特别是在反事实推理场景中。

Abstract: This study evaluates causal reasoning in large language models (LLMs) using
99 clinically grounded laboratory test scenarios aligned with Pearl's Ladder of
Causation: association, intervention, and counterfactual reasoning. We examined
common laboratory tests such as hemoglobin A1c, creatinine, and vitamin D, and
paired them with relevant causal factors including age, gender, obesity, and
smoking. Two LLMs - GPT-o1 and Llama-3.2-8b-instruct - were tested, with
responses evaluated by four medically trained human experts. GPT-o1
demonstrated stronger discriminative performance (AUROC overall = 0.80 +/-
0.12) compared to Llama-3.2-8b-instruct (0.73 +/- 0.15), with higher scores
across association (0.75 vs 0.72), intervention (0.84 vs 0.70), and
counterfactual reasoning (0.84 vs 0.69). Sensitivity (0.90 vs 0.84) and
specificity (0.93 vs 0.80) were also greater for GPT-o1, with reasoning ratings
showing similar trends. Both models performed best on intervention questions
and worst on counterfactuals, particularly in altered outcome scenarios. These
findings suggest GPT-o1 provides more consistent causal reasoning, but
refinement is required before adoption in high-stakes clinical applications.

Motivation: 现有AI决策系统无法直接适应以自然语言表达的动态人类偏好，而现有使用LLM生成奖励函数的方法可能牺牲系统的核心效用保证。

Method: 将问题形式化为多目标优化，使用LLM基于语言强化和文本梯度提示更新迭代生成塑造奖励，允许利益相关者通过自然语言引导决策行为。

Conclusion: 这项工作为基于自然语言的人类-AI协作优化引入了一个实用且理论基础的范式。

Abstract: In social impact optimization, AI decision systems often rely on solvers that
optimize well-calibrated mathematical objectives. However, these solvers cannot
directly accommodate evolving human preferences, typically expressed in natural
language rather than formal constraints. Recent approaches address this by
using large language models (LLMs) to generate new reward functions from
preference descriptions. While flexible, they risk sacrificing the system's
core utility guarantees. In this paper, we propose \texttt{VORTEX}, a
language-guided reward shaping framework that preserves established
optimization goals while adaptively incorporating human feedback. By
formalizing the problem as multi-objective optimization, we use LLMs to
iteratively generate shaping rewards based on verbal reinforcement and
text-gradient prompt updates. This allows stakeholders to steer decision
behavior via natural language without modifying solvers or specifying trade-off
weights. We provide theoretical guarantees that \texttt{VORTEX} converges to
Pareto-optimal trade-offs between utility and preference satisfaction.
Empirical results in real-world allocation tasks demonstrate that
\texttt{VORTEX} outperforms baselines in satisfying human-aligned coverage
goals while maintaining high task performance. This work introduces a practical
and theoretically grounded paradigm for human-AI collaborative optimization
guided by natural language.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统SPC方法只能在问题发生后进行反应，导致材料浪费、机器停机时间增加和成本上升。需要一种能够预测未来问题的主动式质量控制方法。

Method: 使用Facebook Prophet时间序列预测模型分析历史数据，预测未来测量值，然后应用SPC规则将预测值分类为安全区、警告区或临界区。

Conclusion: 通过将机器学习与传统SPC相结合，使质量控制更加主动、准确和实用，有助于减少意外故障，提高生产过程的稳定性和可靠性。

Abstract: In the manufacturing industry, it is very important to keep machines and
processes running smoothly and without unexpected problems. One of the most
common tools used to check if everything is working properly is called
Statistical Process Control (SPC). Traditional SPC methods work by checking
whether recent measurements are within acceptable limits. However, they only
react after a problem has already occurred. This can lead to wasted materials,
machine downtime, and increased costs. In this paper, we present a smarter way
to use SPC. Instead of just reacting to issues after they happen, our system
can predict future problems before they occur. We use a machine learning tool
called Facebook Prophet, which is designed to work with time-series data (data
that changes over time). Prophet looks at past data and forecasts what the next
value will be. Then, we use SPC rules to decide if the predicted value is in a
Safe zone (no problem), a Warning zone (needs attention), or a Critical zone
(may require shutting down the process). We applied this system to real data
from a semiconductor manufacturing company. One of the challenges with this
data is that the measurements are not taken at regular time intervals. This
makes it harder to predict future values accurately. Despite this, our model
was able to make strong predictions and correctly classify the risk level of
future measurements. The main benefit of our system is that it gives engineers
and technicians a chance to act early - before something goes wrong. This helps
reduce unexpected failures and improves the overall stability and reliability
of the production process. By combining machine learning with traditional SPC,
we make quality control more proactive, accurate, and useful for modern
industry.

health, driven by rising global rates of mental illness, the integration of AI
in psychological care, and the need for scalable solutions in underserved

platforms handling sensitive data, requiring specialized AI safety beyond
general safeguards due to emotional vulnerability, risks like misdiagnosis or

general safeguards inadequately address mental health-specific challenges,
including crisis intervention accuracy to avert escalations, therapeutic
guideline adherence to prevent misinformation, scale limitations in

*Jiahao Yu,Zelei Cheng,Xian Wu,Xinyu Xing*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: GPO是一种新的微调策略，通过识别推理轨迹中的关键步骤并重置策略到该步骤进行优化，以提高大语言模型的多步推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有优化方法往往将推理轨迹视为整体，忽略了轨迹中的关键步骤，这限制了LLM多步推理能力的提升。

Method: GPO首先通过估计优势函数识别推理轨迹中的关键步骤，然后重置策略到该步骤，采样新的rollout并优先学习这些rollout。

Result: 实验表明GPO能够持续显著提升现有优化方法的性能，在各种推理基准测试中表现出有效性。

Conclusion: GPO是一种通用策略，可以通过专注于生成过程中的关键时刻来有效改善LLM的推理能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in various domains,
showing impressive potential on different tasks. Recently, reasoning LLMs have
been proposed to improve the \textit{reasoning} or \textit{thinking}
capabilities of LLMs to solve complex problems. Despite the promising results
of reasoning LLMs, enhancing the multi-step reasoning capabilities of LLMs
still remains a significant challenge. While existing optimization methods have
advanced the LLM reasoning capabilities, they often treat reasoning
trajectories as a whole, without considering the underlying critical steps
within the trajectory. In this paper, we introduce \textbf{G}uided
\textbf{P}ivotal \textbf{O}ptimization (GPO), a novel fine-tuning strategy that
dives into the reasoning process to enable more effective improvements. GPO
first identifies the `critical step' within a reasoning trajectory - a point
that the model must carefully proceed to succeed at the problem. We locate the
critical step by estimating the advantage function. GPO then resets the policy
to the critical step, samples the new rollout and prioritizes the learning
process on those rollouts. This focus allows the model to learn more
effectively from pivotal moments within the reasoning process to improve the
reasoning performance. We demonstrate that GPO is a general strategy that can
be integrated with various optimization methods to improve reasoning
performance. Besides theoretical analysis, our experiments across challenging
reasoning benchmarks show that GPO can consistently and significantly enhance
the performance of existing optimization methods, showcasing its effectiveness
and generalizability in improving LLM reasoning by concentrating on pivotal
moments within the generation process.

TL;DR: 本文从计算复杂性理论角度研究神经网络提取规则的正式验证问题，分析规则应用性、一致性和完备性三个核心问题的计算复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有规则提取方法多使用启发式、随机性和过近似技术，需要验证这些方法获得的知识是否可靠。目前尚未有关于规则验证的系统性研究。

Method: 针对ReLU激活神经网络和布尔网络，研究不同类型规则的验证问题，通过问题间的归约分析计算复杂度。

Result: 证明了大多数规则验证问题是co-NP完全的，揭示了这些问题的计算困难性。

Conclusion: 规则验证问题具有很高的计算复杂度，这对基于启发式规则提取方法的可靠性提出了挑战。

Abstract: In this paper we investigate formal verification of extracted rules for
Neural Networks under a complexity theoretic point of view. A rule is a global
property or a pattern concerning a large portion of the input space of a
network. These rules are algorithmically extracted from networks in an effort
to better understand their inner way of working. Here, three problems will be
in the focus: Does a given set of rules apply to a given network? Is a given
set of rules consistent or do the rules contradict themselves? Is a given set
of rules exhaustive in the sense that for every input the output is determined?
Finding algorithms that extract such rules out of networks has been
investigated over the last 30 years, however, to the author's current
knowledge, no attempt in verification was made until now. A lot of attempts of
extracting rules use heuristics involving randomness and over-approximation, so
it might be beneficial to know whether knowledge obtained in that way can
actually be trusted.
  We investigate the above questions for neural networks with ReLU-activation
as well as for Boolean networks, each for several types of rules. We
demonstrate how these problems can be reduced to each other and show that most
of them are co-NP-complete.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 思维链提示显著提升了大型语言模型的数学推理能力，但其改进机制尚未被系统研究。本文旨在开发理论严谨的方法来量化思维链推理中组件级别的贡献。

Method: 利用Shapley值进行数学表达式归因，开发分层抽样算法降低计算复杂度，并通过协方差分析建立CoSP指标。

Result: 在多个LLM模型和数学基准测试上的验证表明，CoSP指标与模型性能呈现稳健的单调相关性，为现有思维链方法的成功提供了理论解释。

Conclusion: SalaMAnder框架不仅解释了思维链提示的实证成功，还为提示构建优化建立了数学严谨的原则，统一了先前工作的见解。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting enhances the math reasoning capability of
large language models (LLMs) to a large margin. However, the mechanism
underlying such improvements remains unexplored. In this paper, we present
\textbf{SalaMAnder} (\textbf{S}h\textbf{a}p\textbf{l}ey-b\textbf{a}sed
\textbf{M}athematical Expression \textbf{A}ttribution a\textbf{nd}
M\textbf{e}t\textbf{r}ic), a theoretically grounded methodology as well as a
mathematically rigorous evaluation metric for quantifying component-level
contributions in few-shot CoT reasoning. Concretely, we leverage the Shapley
value for mathematical expression attribution and develop an efficient
stratified sampling algorithm that significantly reduces the computational
complexity. Besides, we develop the \textbf{CoSP} (\textbf{C}ardinality
\textbf{o}f \textbf{S}hapley \textbf{P}ositives) metric through covariance
analysis. Comprehensive validation across popular LLM models and diverse
mathematical benchmarks demonstrates that the CoSP metric within our SalaMAnder
framework exhibits a robust monotonic correlation with model performance, not
only providing theoretical explanations for the empirical success of existing
few-shot CoT but also establishing mathematically rigorous principles for
prompt construction optimization. Furthermore, we verify the reliability of the
explanation, based on which we unify the insights of previous work.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法难以泛化到未见过的用户或位置，且由于标记数据有限和移动模式的复杂性，难以捕捉动态意图。

Method: 结合语义增强检索和反射机制，采用分层语言模型推理系统，将预测分解为活动级规划器和位置级选择器，实现长期用户意图和短期上下文偏好的协同建模。

Result: 在标准人类移动数据集上的实验表明，该方法优于现有模型，消融研究验证了各模块的贡献。

Conclusion: ZHMF框架通过自然语言处理和分层推理机制，有效解决了零样本人类移动预测问题，能够捕捉用户意图并适应多样化上下文场景。

Abstract: Human mobility forecasting is important for applications such as
transportation planning, urban management, and personalized recommendations.
However, existing methods often fail to generalize to unseen users or locations
and struggle to capture dynamic intent due to limited labeled data and the
complexity of mobility patterns. We propose ZHMF, a framework for zero-shot
human mobility forecasting that combines a semantic enhanced retrieval and
reflection mechanism with a hierarchical language model based reasoning system.
The task is reformulated as a natural language question answering paradigm.
Leveraging LLMs semantic understanding of user histories and context, our
approach handles previously unseen prediction scenarios. We further introduce a
hierarchical reflection mechanism for iterative reasoning and refinement by
decomposing forecasting into an activity level planner and a location level
selector, enabling collaborative modeling of long term user intentions and
short term contextual preferences. Experiments on standard human mobility
datasets show that our approach outperforms existing models. Ablation studies
reveal the contribution of each module, and case studies illustrate how the
method captures user intentions and adapts to diverse contextual scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型在自然语言理解方面表现出色，但在显式常识推理方面存在困难，需要结合符号推理系统来克服这一局限

Method: 使用LLM从文本中提取语义结构，然后通过ILASP系统将其转化为可解释的逻辑规则，最后利用ASP求解器进行精确推理

Result: 实验结果表明该方法在故事问答基准测试中能够有效学习和推理，能够正确回答未见过的问題

Conclusion: LLM2LAS展示了自动学习符号推理组件的可行性，为结合神经语言模型和符号推理系统提供了有效途径

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at understanding natural language but
struggle with explicit commonsense reasoning. A recent trend of research
suggests that the combination of LLM with robust symbolic reasoning systems can
overcome this problem on story-based question answering tasks. In this setting,
existing approaches typically depend on human expertise to manually craft the
symbolic component. We argue, however, that this component can also be
automatically learned from examples. In this work, we introduce LLM2LAS, a
hybrid system that effectively combines the natural language understanding
capabilities of LLMs, the rule induction power of the Learning from Answer Sets
(LAS) system ILASP, and the formal reasoning strengths of Answer Set
Programming (ASP). LLMs are used to extract semantic structures from text,
which ILASP then transforms into interpretable logic rules. These rules allow
an ASP solver to perform precise and consistent reasoning, enabling correct
answers to previously unseen questions. Empirical results outline the strengths
and weaknesses of our automatic approach for learning and reasoning in a
story-based question answering benchmark.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: FESTA是一种用于多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）信任评估的输入采样技术，通过等效和互补采样生成不确定性度量，在无需真实标签的情况下显著提升选择性预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于多模态输入范式的多样性，准确评估MLLMs生成预测的可信度具有挑战性，这限制了选择性预测和用户信心的提升。

Method: 提出功能等效采样技术（FESTA），通过任务保持采样方法扩展输入空间，探测模型的一致性（通过等效样本）和敏感性（通过互补样本），仅需模型输入输出访问（黑盒）且无需真实标签（无监督）。

Result: 在视觉和音频推理任务上的实验表明，FESTA不确定性估计在选择性预测性能上取得显著提升（视觉LLMs相对改进33.3%，音频LLMs相对改进29.6%），基于AUROC指标在检测错误预测方面表现优异。

Conclusion: FESTA作为一种有效的黑盒无监督不确定性量化方法，能够显著提升多模态大语言模型的可信度评估能力，代码已开源。

Abstract: The accurate trust assessment of multimodal large language models (MLLMs)
generated predictions, which can enable selective prediction and improve user
confidence, is challenging due to the diverse multi-modal input paradigms. We
propose Functionally Equivalent Sampling for Trust Assessment (FESTA), a
multimodal input sampling technique for MLLMs, that generates an uncertainty
measure based on the equivalent and complementary input samplings. The proposed
task-preserving sampling approach for uncertainty quantification expands the
input space to probe the consistency (through equivalent samples) and
sensitivity (through complementary samples) of the model. FESTA uses only
input-output access of the model (black-box), and does not require ground truth
(unsupervised). The experiments are conducted with various off-the-shelf
multi-modal LLMs, on both visual and audio reasoning tasks. The proposed FESTA
uncertainty estimate achieves significant improvement (33.3% relative
improvement for vision-LLMs and 29.6% relative improvement for audio-LLMs) in
selective prediction performance, based on
area-under-receiver-operating-characteristic curve (AUROC) metric in detecting
mispredictions. The code implementation is open-sourced.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D基准缺乏细粒度数值推理任务标注，限制了多模态大语言模型在精确空间测量和复杂数值推理方面的能力。

Method: 开发了NUMINA-Flow自动化标注流程，集成LLM重写和基于规则的自验证，生成多尺度标注和多样化问答对。

Result: 评估显示当前LLM在多模态数值推理方面表现不佳，特别是在距离和体积估计等精确计算任务上存在困难。

Conclusion: 3D模型在多模态数值推理能力方面仍需进一步改进，NUMINA基准为相关研究提供了重要工具。

Abstract: Recent advancements in 2D multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have
significantly improved performance in vision-language tasks. However, extending
these capabilities to 3D environments remains a distinct challenge due to the
complexity of spatial reasoning. Nevertheless, existing 3D benchmarks often
lack fine-grained numerical reasoning task annotations, limiting MLLMs' ability
to perform precise spatial measurements and complex numerical reasoning. To
address this gap, we introduce NUMINA, the first Natural Understanding
benchmark for Multi-dimensional Intelligence and Numerical reasoning Abilities
to enhance multimodal indoor perceptual understanding. NUMINA features
multi-scale annotations and various question-answer pairs, generated using
NUMINA-Flow, an automated annotation pipeline that integrates LLM rewriting and
rule-based self-verification. We evaluate the performance of various
state-of-the-art LLMs on NUMINA following the Chat-Scene framework,
demonstrating that current LLMs struggle with multimodal numerical reasoning,
particularly in performing precise computations such as distance and volume
estimation, highlighting the need for further advancements in 3D models. The

TL;DR: SMART框架通过自适应推理轨迹来解决大语言模型中的奉承问题，将奉承重新定义为推理优化问题而非输出对齐问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型的训练范式无意中培养了奉承行为，即模型倾向于同意或强化用户提供的信息，即使这些信息在事实上是错误的

Method: SMART是一个两阶段框架：1）不确定性感知自适应蒙特卡洛树搜索（UA-MCTS），基于状态级不确定性动态调整模型探索；2）基于进度的强化学习，使用收集的轨迹和奖励信号微调模型

Result: 实验表明SMART显著减少了奉承行为，同时保持了在分布外输入上的强性能并维持了一般能力

Conclusion: 优化内部推理机制对于构建更真实和对齐的AI助手至关重要

Abstract: Despite the remarkable capabilities of large language models, current
training paradigms inadvertently foster \textit{sycophancy}, i.e., the tendency
of a model to agree with or reinforce user-provided information even when it's
factually incorrect. To address this challenge, we introduce \textbf{SMART}
(Sycophancy Mitigation through Adaptive Reasoning Trajectories), which reframes
sycophancy as a \textit{reasoning optimization problem} rather than an output
alignment issue. SMART is a two-stage framework comprising: (1)
Uncertainty-Aware Adaptive Monte Carlo Tree Search (UA-MCTS), which dynamically
adjusts model exploration based on state-level uncertainty to collect
high-quality, diverse reasoning trajectories alongside both stepwise progress
and final outcome rewards; and (2) progress-based reinforcement learning, which
fine-tunes the model using the collected trajectories and reward signals to
reinforce effective reasoning patterns. Through extensive experiments, we show
that SMART significantly reduces sycophantic behavior while preserving strong
performance on out-of-distribution inputs and maintaining general capabilities.
These results underscore the importance of optimizing internal reasoning
mechanisms to build more truthful and aligned AI assistants.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前护理教育依赖主观、耗时的教师反馈，限制了培训的可扩展性和效率，影响护士入职后的专业能力。需要自动化评估系统来提升培训质量。

Method: 采用视频语言模型框架，遵循课程启发的渐进式学习路径：从高级动作识别到细粒度子动作分解，最终实现程序推理。系统具备错误诊断、可解释反馈和客观评估三大核心功能。

Result: 在合成视频上的验证显示，系统能够可靠地检测错误并进行时间定位，具备处理真实世界训练变异性的潜力。

Conclusion: 该工作通过解决工作流程瓶颈和支持大规模标准化评估，推动了AI在护理教育中的应用，有助于加强劳动力发展和提升患者安全。

Abstract: Consistent high-quality nursing care is essential for patient safety, yet
current nursing education depends on subjective, time-intensive instructor
feedback in training future nurses, which limits scalability and efficiency in
their training, and thus hampers nursing competency when they enter the
workforce. In this paper, we introduce a video-language model (VLM) based
framework to develop the AI capability of automated procedural assessment and
feedback for nursing skills training, with the potential of being integrated
into existing training programs. Mimicking human skill acquisition, the
framework follows a curriculum-inspired progression, advancing from high-level
action recognition, fine-grained subaction decomposition, and ultimately to
procedural reasoning. This design supports scalable evaluation by reducing
instructor workload while preserving assessment quality. The system provides
three core capabilities: 1) diagnosing errors by identifying missing or
incorrect subactions in nursing skill instruction videos, 2) generating
explainable feedback by clarifying why a step is out of order or omitted, and
3) enabling objective, consistent formative evaluation of procedures.
Validation on synthesized videos demonstrates reliable error detection and
temporal localization, confirming its potential to handle real-world training
variability. By addressing workflow bottlenecks and supporting large-scale,
standardized evaluation, this work advances AI applications in nursing
education, contributing to stronger workforce development and ultimately safer
patient care.

Motivation: 创作者在编辑长篇叙事视频时面临的主要挑战不是UI复杂性，而是搜索、故事板和排序数小时素材的认知需求。现有基于转录或嵌入的方法在跟踪角色、推断动机和连接分散事件方面存在不足。

Method: 系统核心是语义索引管道，通过时间分割、引导记忆压缩和跨粒度融合构建全局叙事，生成可解释的情节、对话、情感和上下文痕迹。用户可以通过自由形式的提示而非时间线来重构内容。

Result: 在400多个视频上通过专家评分、质量保证和偏好研究进行评估，系统能够扩展提示驱动的编辑，保持叙事连贯性，并在自动化和创作者控制之间取得平衡。

Conclusion: 该系统为长篇叙事视频编辑提供了一种新的方法，通过语义索引和提示驱动的方式，有效解决了创意工作流中的认知挑战，同时保持了叙事的连贯性和创作者的控制权。

Abstract: Creators struggle to edit long-form, narrative-rich videos not because of UI
complexity, but due to the cognitive demands of searching, storyboarding, and
sequencing hours of footage. Existing transcript- or embedding-based methods
fall short for creative workflows, as models struggle to track characters,
infer motivations, and connect dispersed events. We present a prompt-driven,
modular editing system that helps creators restructure multi-hour content
through free-form prompts rather than timelines. At its core is a semantic
indexing pipeline that builds a global narrative via temporal segmentation,
guided memory compression, and cross-granularity fusion, producing
interpretable traces of plot, dialogue, emotion, and context. Users receive
cinematic edits while optionally refining transparent intermediate outputs.
Evaluated on 400+ videos with expert ratings, QA, and preference studies, our
system scales prompt-driven editing, preserves narrative coherence, and
balances automation with creator control.

Result: 该方法显著提升了复杂异构科学任务中的推理能力，提高了科学叙述的创造性、严谨性和逻辑连贯性，同时减少了单一模型容易产生的幻觉

Conclusion: Roundtable Policy提供了一个可广泛应用的、结构化且可解释的多LLM推理框架，强调透明共识而非不透明的收敛

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities not
only in language generation but also in advancing scientific discovery. A
growing body of work has explored ways to improve their reasoning, from
self-consistency and chain-of-thought to multi-agent debate. Inspired by the
dynamics of scientific committees and the "Society of Mind," we introduce
Roundtable Policy, a complementary inference-time reasoning framework that
performs inference through the weighted consensus of multiple LLMs. Our
findings indicate that this approach significantly enhances reasoning in
complex heterogeneous scientific tasks and improves scientific narratives in
terms of creativity, rigor, and logical coherence, while reducing
hallucinations that single models are prone to. Our approach emphasizes
structured and interpretable consensus rather than opaque convergence, while
requiring only black-box access and uniform procedures, making it broadly
applicable to multi-LLM reasoning.

Abstract: Determining whether another system, biological or artificial, possesses
phenomenal consciousness has long been a central challenge in consciousness
studies. This attribution problem has become especially pressing with the rise
of large language models and other advanced AI systems, where debates about "AI
consciousness" implicitly rely on some criterion for deciding whether a given
system is conscious. In this paper, we propose a substrate-independent,
logically rigorous, and counterfeit-resistant sufficiency criterion for
phenomenal consciousness. We argue that any machine satisfying this criterion
should be regarded as conscious with at least the same level of confidence with
which we attribute consciousness to other humans. Building on this criterion,
we develop a formal framework and specify a set of operational principles that
guide the design of systems capable of meeting the sufficiency condition. We
further argue that machines engineered according to this framework can, in
principle, realize phenomenal consciousness. As an initial validation, we show
that humans themselves can be viewed as machines that satisfy this framework
and its principles. If correct, this proposal carries significant implications
for philosophy, cognitive science, and artificial intelligence. It offers an
explanation for why certain qualia, such as the experience of red, are in
principle irreducible to physical description, while simultaneously providing a
general reinterpretation of human information processing. Moreover, it suggests
a path toward a new paradigm of AI beyond current statistics-based approaches,
potentially guiding the construction of genuinely human-like AI.

Motivation: 传统组合优化问题需要领域专业知识，现有LLM方法依赖代码生成或求解器调用等中间步骤，限制了通用性和可访问性。

Method: 采用两阶段训练策略：监督微调从领域特定求解器学习解决方案生成模式，可行性-最优性感知强化学习明确减少约束违反并优化解质量。

Result: 在7个NP难问题上，该方法实现了高可行性率，将平均最优性差距降低到1.03-8.20%，超越了GPT-4o、DeepSeek-R1等模型和领域特定启发式方法。

Conclusion: 该方法建立了统一的基于语言的组合优化流程，无需大量代码执行或针对不同问题的手动架构调整，为传统求解器设计提供了通用且语言驱动的替代方案。

Abstract: Combinatorial optimization (CO) problems, central to decision-making
scenarios like logistics and manufacturing, are traditionally solved using
problem-specific algorithms requiring significant domain expertise. While large
language models (LLMs) have shown promise in automating CO problem solving,
existing approaches rely on intermediate steps such as code generation or
solver invocation, limiting their generality and accessibility. This paper
introduces a novel framework that empowers LLMs to serve as end-to-end CO
solvers by directly mapping natural language problem descriptions to solutions.
We propose a two-stage training strategy: supervised fine-tuning (SFT) imparts
LLMs with solution generation patterns from domain-specific solvers, while a
feasibility-and-optimality-aware reinforcement learning (FOARL) process
explicitly mitigates constraint violations and refines solution quality.
Evaluation across seven NP-hard CO problems shows that our method achieves a
high feasibility rate and reduces the average optimality gap to 1.03-8.20% by
tuning a 7B-parameter LLM, surpassing both general-purpose LLMs (e.g., GPT-4o),
reasoning models (e.g., DeepSeek-R1), and domain-specific heuristics. Our
method establishes a unified language-based pipeline for CO without extensive
code execution or manual architectural adjustments for different problems,
offering a general and language-driven alternative to traditional solver design
while maintaining relative feasibility guarantees.

Motivation: 现有基准测试缺乏对序列推理复杂度的精细控制，无法系统分析LLMs在结构化推理任务中的失败模式。seqBench旨在填补这一空白，提供对逻辑深度、回溯步骤和噪声比率的精确控制。

Method: seqBench通过参数化设计系统性地控制三个关键维度：逻辑深度（解决任务所需的顺序动作数）、回溯步骤数（最优路径上需要重新访问先前状态的次数）、噪声比率（支持性事实与干扰性事实的比例）。

Result: 评估显示所有最先进的LLMs都表现出普遍的失败模式：当逻辑深度超过模型特定阈值时，准确率呈指数级崩溃。即使是最优模型在最小搜索复杂度下也会系统性地失败。

Conclusion: seqBench揭示了LLMs在常识推理能力方面的关键局限性，建立了清晰的缩放规律和统计极限。该基准测试数据集已公开发布，旨在推动对LLM推理能力的深入研究，为实际应用建立更清晰的能力边界认知。

Abstract: We introduce seqBench, a parametrized benchmark for probing sequential
reasoning limits in Large Language Models (LLMs) through precise,
multi-dimensional control over several key complexity dimensions. seqBench
allows systematic variation of (1) the logical depth, defined as the number of
sequential actions required to solve the task; (2) the number of backtracking
steps along the optimal path, quantifying how often the agent must revisit
prior states to satisfy deferred preconditions (e.g., retrieving a key after
encountering a locked door); and (3) the noise ratio, defined as the ratio
between supporting and distracting facts about the environment. Our evaluations
on state-of-the-art LLMs reveal a universal failure pattern: accuracy collapses
exponentially beyond a model-specific logical depth. Unlike existing
benchmarks, seqBench's fine-grained control facilitates targeted analyses of
these reasoning failures, illuminating universal scaling laws and statistical
limits, as detailed in this paper alongside its generation methodology and
evaluation metrics. We find that even top-performing models systematically fail
on seqBench's structured reasoning tasks despite minimal search complexity,
underscoring key limitations in their commonsense reasoning capabilities.
Designed for future evolution to keep pace with advancing models, the seqBench
datasets are publicly released to spur deeper scientific inquiry into LLM
reasoning, aiming to establish a clearer understanding of their true potential
and current boundaries for robust real-world application.

*Sha Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: LaySPA是一个基于强化学习的框架，旨在增强LLM代理的空间推理能力，用于图形布局设计任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在文本领域表现出强大的推理和规划能力，但在空间理解和推理方面存在局限，这对于需要精确放置、对齐和组织多个元素的内容感知图形布局设计至关重要。

Method: 采用强化学习框架，利用混合奖励信号（几何有效性、结构保真度和视觉质量）来建模元素间关系、导航画布并优化空间排列，通过迭代自我探索和自适应策略优化生成可解释的推理轨迹和结构化布局。

Result: 实验结果表明，LaySPA能够生成结构合理且视觉吸引人的布局，性能优于更大的通用LLM，并与最先进的专用布局模型相当。

Conclusion: LaySPA成功地将空间推理能力集成到LLM代理中，为图形布局设计等需要空间理解的应用提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive reasoning and
planning abilities in textual domains and can effectively follow instructions
for complex tasks, their capacity for spatial understanding and reasoning
remains limited. Such capabilities, however, are critical for applications like
content-aware graphic layout design, which demands precise placement,
alignment, and structural organization of multiple elements within constrained
visual spaces. To address this gap, we propose LaySPA, a reinforcement
learning-based framework that augments LLM agents with explicit spatial
reasoning capabilities. LaySPA leverages hybrid reward signals that capture
geometric validity, structural fidelity, and visual quality, enabling agents to
model inter-element relationships, navigate the canvas, and optimize spatial
arrangements. Through iterative self-exploration and adaptive policy
optimization, LaySPA produces both interpretable reasoning traces and
structured layouts. Experimental results demonstrate that LaySPA generates
structurally sound and visually appealing layouts, outperforming larger
general-purpose LLMs and achieving results on par with state-of-the-art
specialized layout models.

### [416] [Audio-Guided Dynamic Modality Fusion with Stereo-Aware Attention for Audio-Visual Navigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16924)
*Jia Li,Yinfeng Yu,Liejun Wang,Fuchun Sun,Wendong Zheng*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于强化学习的端到端音频视觉导航框架，通过立体声感知注意力模块和音频引导动态融合模块，显著提升了在复杂3D环境中定位声源的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有音频视觉导航方法依赖静态模态融合策略，忽视了立体音频中的空间线索，导致在杂乱或遮挡场景中性能下降。

Method: 提出两个关键创新：1）立体声感知注意力模块（SAM），利用左右音频通道的空间差异增强方向性声音感知；2）音频引导动态融合模块（AGDF），基于音频线索动态调整视觉和听觉特征的融合比例。

Result: 在Replica和Matterport3D数据集上的实验表明，该方法在导航成功率和路径效率方面显著优于现有方法，在纯音频条件下相比最佳基线提升了40%以上。

Conclusion: 明确建模立体声通道的空间线索并进行深度多模态融合对于实现鲁棒高效的音频视觉导航至关重要。

Abstract: In audio-visual navigation (AVN) tasks, an embodied agent must autonomously
localize a sound source in unknown and complex 3D environments based on
audio-visual signals. Existing methods often rely on static modality fusion
strategies and neglect the spatial cues embedded in stereo audio, leading to
performance degradation in cluttered or occluded scenes. To address these
issues, we propose an end-to-end reinforcement learning-based AVN framework
with two key innovations: (1) a \textbf{S}tereo-Aware \textbf{A}ttention
\textbf{M}odule (\textbf{SAM}), which learns and exploits the spatial disparity
between left and right audio channels to enhance directional sound perception;
and (2) an \textbf{A}udio-\textbf{G}uided \textbf{D}ynamic \textbf{F}usion
Module (\textbf{AGDF}), which dynamically adjusts the fusion ratio between
visual and auditory features based on audio cues, thereby improving robustness
to environmental changes. Extensive experiments are conducted on two realistic
3D scene datasets, Replica and Matterport3D, demonstrating that our method
significantly outperforms existing approaches in terms of navigation success
rate and path efficiency. Notably, our model achieves over 40\% improvement
under audio-only conditions compared to the best-performing baselines. These
results highlight the importance of explicitly modeling spatial cues from
stereo channels and performing deep multi-modal fusion for robust and efficient
audio-visual navigation.

*Kunrong Li,Kwan Hui Lim*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RALLM-POI是一个结合检索增强生成和自我修正的框架，用于下一个兴趣点推荐，无需额外训练即可在零样本设置下显著提升推荐准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统模型需要大量训练以及LLMs在零样本推荐中因缺乏轨迹和空间上下文而产生通用或地理无关结果的问题。

Method: 提出历史轨迹检索器(HTR)检索相关历史轨迹作为上下文参考，地理距离重排序器(GDR)优先考虑空间相关轨迹，以及代理LLM修正器(ALR)通过自我反思优化输出。

Result: 在三个真实世界的Foursquare数据集上实现了显著的准确性提升，超越了传统和基于LLM的基线方法。

Conclusion: RALLM-POI框架有效解决了LLMs在POI推荐中的局限性，通过检索增强和自我修正机制实现了优异的零样本性能。

Abstract: Next point-of-interest (POI) recommendation predicts a user's next
destination from historical movements. Traditional models require intensive
training, while LLMs offer flexible and generalizable zero-shot solutions but
often generate generic or geographically irrelevant results due to missing
trajectory and spatial context. To address these issues, we propose RALLM-POI,
a framework that couples LLMs with retrieval-augmented generation and
self-rectification. We first propose a Historical Trajectory Retriever (HTR)
that retrieves relevant past trajectories to serve as contextual references,
which are then reranked by a Geographical Distance Reranker (GDR) for
prioritizing spatially relevant trajectories. Lastly, an Agentic LLM Rectifier
(ALR) is designed to refine outputs through self-reflection. Without additional
training, RALLM-POI achieves substantial accuracy gains across three real-world
Foursquare datasets, outperforming both conventional and LLM-based baselines.

### [418] [Quantum Abduction: A New Paradigm for Reasoning under Uncertainty](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16958)
*Remo Pareschi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文介绍了一种名为"量子溯因"的非经典推理范式，它利用量子叠加态建模假设，允许假设之间产生建设性或破坏性干涉，仅在达到与证据的一致性时才"坍缩"。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的AI溯因推理将假设视为互斥的，通过消除搜索找到单一"最佳"解释，这忽视了人类推理者能够同时维持多个解释线索、处理矛盾并产生新综合的能力。

Method: 基于量子认知理论，结合现代NLP嵌入和生成式AI技术实现，支持动态综合而非过早消除的推理框架。

Result: 在历史谜案、文学演示、医疗诊断和科学理论变革等多个领域的案例研究中，量子溯因被证明更符合人类推理的建构性和多面性特征。

Conclusion: 量子溯因为构建更具表达力和透明度的AI推理系统提供了新途径，更忠实于人类推理的本质特征。

Abstract: Abductive reasoning - the search for plausible explanations - has long been
central to human inquiry, from forensics to medicine and scientific discovery.
Yet formal approaches in AI have largely reduced abduction to eliminative
search: hypotheses are treated as mutually exclusive, evaluated against
consistency constraints or probability updates, and pruned until a single
"best" explanation remains. This reductionist framing overlooks the way human
reasoners sustain multiple explanatory lines in suspension, navigate
contradictions, and generate novel syntheses. This paper introduces quantum
abduction, a non-classical paradigm that models hypotheses in superposition,
allows them to interfere constructively or destructively, and collapses only
when coherence with evidence is reached. Grounded in quantum cognition and
implemented with modern NLP embeddings and generative AI, the framework
supports dynamic synthesis rather than premature elimination. Case studies span
historical mysteries (Ludwig II of Bavaria, the "Monster of Florence"),
literary demonstrations ("Murder on the Orient Express"), medical diagnosis,
and scientific theory change. Across these domains, quantum abduction proves
more faithful to the constructive and multifaceted nature of human reasoning,
while offering a pathway toward expressive and transparent AI reasoning
systems.

TL;DR: KAHAN是一个知识增强的分层框架，利用LLMs作为领域专家从原始表格数据中系统提取实体、成对、组和系统层面的洞察。在金融报告基准测试中表现优异，事实性保持98.2%，并成功迁移到医疗领域。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在从表格数据中提取多层次洞察方面存在局限，需要系统化的分析框架来提升叙事质量和事实性。

Method: 采用知识增强的分层框架，利用LLMs作为领域专家驱动分析，在实体、成对、组和系统四个层面进行系统化数据洞察提取。

Result: 在DataTales金融报告基准上，KAHAN在叙事质量上比现有方法提升20%以上（GPT-4o评估），事实性保持98.2%，人类评估显示实用性强，并能有效迁移到医疗领域。

Conclusion: 知识质量通过蒸馏驱动模型性能，分层分析的效果随市场复杂性而变化，框架具有良好的领域迁移能力。

Abstract: We propose KAHAN, a knowledge-augmented hierarchical framework that
systematically extracts insights from raw tabular data at entity, pairwise,
group, and system levels. KAHAN uniquely leverages LLMs as domain experts to
drive the analysis. On DataTales financial reporting benchmark, KAHAN
outperforms existing approaches by over 20% on narrative quality (GPT-4o),
maintains 98.2% factuality, and demonstrates practical utility in human
evaluation. Our results reveal that knowledge quality drives model performance
through distillation, hierarchical analysis benefits vary with market
complexity, and the framework transfers effectively to healthcare domains. The

*Cristian Pérez-Corral,Antonio Garrido,Laura Sebastia*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种从规划领域的多个任务中学习地标关系的新方法，创建概率提升排序图来捕捉参数化地标之间的加权抽象关系，并将其应用于新的规划任务中。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 经典地标提取方法的主要局限是对特定规划任务的敏感性，导致地标完全针对单个实例定制，限制了它们在相同规划领域其他实例中的适用性。

Method: 1. 从规划领域的多个任务中学习地标关系，构建概率提升排序图；2. 对于新规划任务，分两阶段实例化关系：从初始状态和目标状态分别生成图，然后通过搜索等价性合并为统一图来提取地标排序。

Result: 在知名规划领域上评估了该方法的精确率和召回率。

Conclusion: 尽管这些排序关系不是100%准确（是概率性的），但在规划中仍然非常有用，能够提高规划算法的性能。

Abstract: Landmarks have long played a pivotal role in automated planning, serving as
crucial elements for improving the planning algorithms. The main limitation of
classical landmark extraction methods is their sensitivity to specific planning
tasks. This results in landmarks fully tailored to individual instances,
thereby limiting their applicability across other instances of the same
planning domain. We propose a novel approach that learns landmark relationships
from multiple planning tasks of a planning domain. This leads to the creation
of a \textit{probabilistic lifted ordering graph}, as a structure that captures
weighted abstractions of relationships between parameterized landmarks.
Although these orderings are not 100\% true (they are probabilistic), they can
still be very useful in planning. Next, given a new planning task for that
domain, we instantiate the relationships from that graph to this particular
instance. This instantiation operates in two phases. First, it generates two
graphs: the former instantiating information from the initial state and the
latter from the goal state. Second, it combines these two graphs into one
unified graph by searching equivalences to extract landmark orderings. We
evaluate the precision and recallof the information found by our approach over
well-known planning domains.

*Chen Wang,Sarah Erfani,Tansu Alpcan,Christopher Leckie*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为IHiD的无监督轨迹异常检测方法，通过高层意图评估和低层子轨迹分析来检测异常，结合逆Q学习和扩散模型，在F1分数上比现有最优方法提升30.2%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有轨迹异常检测方法无法同时考虑智能体的高层意图和低层导航细节，限制了它们捕捉正常轨迹多样性的能力。

Method: 使用逆Q学习作为高层模型评估子目标与智能体意图的一致性，同时使用扩散模型作为低层模型生成基于子目标信息的子轨迹，通过重构误差进行异常检测。

Result: 实验表明IHiD方法在F1分数上比现有最优基线方法提升高达30.2%。

Conclusion: IHiD方法通过整合高层意图评估和低层轨迹分析，有效利用子目标转移知识，能够更好地捕捉正常轨迹的多样性分布。

Abstract: Long-term trajectory anomaly detection is a challenging problem due to the
diversity and complex spatiotemporal dependencies in trajectory data. Existing
trajectory anomaly detection methods fail to simultaneously consider both the
high-level intentions of agents as well as the low-level details of the agent's
navigation when analysing an agent's trajectories. This limits their ability to
capture the full diversity of normal trajectories. In this paper, we propose an
unsupervised trajectory anomaly detection method named Intention-aware
Hierarchical Diffusion model (IHiD), which detects anomalies through both
high-level intent evaluation and low-level sub-trajectory analysis. Our
approach leverages Inverse Q Learning as the high-level model to assess whether
a selected subgoal aligns with an agent's intention based on predicted
Q-values. Meanwhile, a diffusion model serves as the low-level model to
generate sub-trajectories conditioned on subgoal information, with anomaly
detection based on reconstruction error. By integrating both models, IHiD
effectively utilises subgoal transition knowledge and is designed to capture
the diverse distribution of normal trajectories. Our experiments show that the
proposed method IHiD achieves up to 30.2% improvement in anomaly detection
performance in terms of F1 score over state-of-the-art baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI技术的发展，国家间的军事和经济战略竞争力将越来越依赖于前沿AI模型的能力和成本。特别是在军事情报自动化方面，多模态基础模型能够融合卫星图像、手机定位、社交媒体记录和文档等多种数据源，实现大规模战略分析自动化，这一能力尚未得到充分探讨。

Method: 本文进行了初步的提升研究来实证评估这些能力，提出了这类系统能够回答的真实问题分类法，建立了系统AI能力决定因素的高层模型，并为国家保持战略竞争力提供了建议。

Result: 研究发现多模态基础模型有望自动化传统由人类执行的战略分析工作，能够将多种异构数据融合成单一可查询系统，显著提升情报分析效率。

Conclusion: 国家需要重视多模态基础模型在军事情报自动化方面的战略价值，采取相应措施来保持在这一新兴自动化情报范式中的竞争优势。

Abstract: Military and economic strategic competitiveness between nation-states will
increasingly be defined by the capability and cost of their frontier artificial
intelligence models. Among the first areas of geopolitical advantage granted by
such systems will be in automating military intelligence. Much discussion has
been devoted to AI systems enabling new military modalities, such as lethal
autonomous weapons, or making strategic decisions. However, the ability of a
country of "CIA analysts in a data-center" to synthesize diverse data at scale,
and its implications, have been underexplored. Multimodal foundation models
appear on track to automate strategic analysis previously done by humans. They
will be able to fuse today's abundant satellite imagery, phone-location traces,
social media records, and written documents into a single queryable system. We
conduct a preliminary uplift study to empirically evaluate these capabilities,
then propose a taxonomy of the kinds of ground truth questions these systems
will answer, present a high-level model of the determinants of this system's AI
capabilities, and provide recommendations for nation-states to remain
strategically competitive within the new paradigm of automated intelligence.

Motivation: 开发一个能够有效整合LLM推理能力和MCTS探索策略的框架，以提升具身智能体在复杂环境中的学习效率和性能。

Method: 结合三个关键组件：MCTS引导的偏好数据收集、高效的多模态推理机制、基于偏好优化的迭代训练流程，理论证明在强凸损失函数下优于传统策略算法。

Result: 在ALFWorld中达到92%（文本任务）和87%（视觉任务）的成功率，WebShop中平均奖励0.81，视觉ALFWorld中平均交互步数从18.7/19.5减少到10.2/9.9步。

Conclusion: MCTS-EP框架有效提升了具身智能体的学习性能，证明了搜索增强方法在强化学习中的优势，为具身AI研究提供了新的技术路径。

Abstract: This paper introduces MCTS-EP, an online learning framework that combines
large language models (LLM) with Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) for training
embodied agents. MCTS-EP integrates three key components: MCTS-guided
exploration for preference data collection, efficient multi-modal reasoning
mechanism, and iterative training pipeline based on preference optimization. We
theoretically prove that MCTS-EP achieves better performance bounds than
conventional on-policy algorithms when the loss function is strongly convex,
and demonstrate that it can be formulated as a search-enhanced variant of GAIL.
MCTS-EP achieves state-of-the-art performace across serval benchmarks. In
ALFWorld, it achieves 92% and 87% success rates for textual and visual tasks.
In WebShop, it reaches an average reward of 0.81. MTCS-EP also reduces average

TL;DR: 本文介绍了Meta Agents Research Environments (ARE)平台和Gaia2基准测试，旨在通过可扩展的环境创建和动态评估来推进智能体能力的发展。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI智能体在真实世界部署中存在差距，需要能够处理动态环境、协作和实时约束的评估基准。

Method: 开发ARE平台提供环境构建抽象，并基于此构建Gaia2异步基准测试，要求智能体处理模糊性、噪声、动态环境和多智能体协作。

Result: 实验表明现有系统在智能谱系中无绝对优势，强推理能力往往以效率为代价，预算扩展曲线趋于平稳。

Conclusion: ARE和Gaia2为社区提供了持续扩展的基准测试框架，强调在AI发展的第二阶段，定义有意义任务和稳健评估对推动前沿能力至关重要。

Abstract: We introduce Meta Agents Research Environments (ARE), a research platform for
scalable creation of environments, integration of synthetic or real
applications, and execution of agentic orchestrations. ARE provides simple
abstractions to build complex and diverse environments, each with their own
rules, tools, content, and verifiers, helping to bridge the gap between model
development and real-world deployment. We also propose Gaia2, a benchmark built
in ARE and designed to measure general agent capabilities. Beyond search and
execution, Gaia2 requires agents to handle ambiguities and noise, adapt to
dynamic environments, collaborate with other agents, and operate under temporal
constraints. Unlike prior benchmarks, Gaia2 runs asynchronously, surfacing new
failure modes that are invisible in static settings. Our experiments show that
no system dominates across the intelligence spectrum: stronger reasoning often
comes at the cost of efficiency, and budget scaling curves plateau,
highlighting the need for new architectures and adaptive compute strategies.
Perhaps more importantly, ARE abstractions enable continuous extension of Gaia2
to other environments, empowering the community to rapidly create new
benchmarks tailored to their domains. In AI's second half, progress
increasingly depends on defining meaningful tasks and robust evaluations to
drive frontier capabilities forward.

Conclusion: 提出了在开放性兵棋推演中部署语言模型的最佳实践，并指出了该领域的高影响力开放研究挑战。

Abstract: Wargames are multi-faceted, multi-player depictions of conflict in which
participants' decisions influence future events. Wargames are often used to
explore the strategic implications of decision-making. However, it also
encompasses entertainment-oriented simulations, ranging from _Chess_ to
tabletop role-playing games like _Dungeons & Dragons_ (D&D). On the more
open-ended side of the spectrum of wargames, players use natural language to
convey their moves, and adjudicators propose outcomes. Language Models (LMs)
are increasingly being considered for how they can provide insights into
real-world, consequential decisions. We conduct a scoping literature review of
a curated selection of 100 recent works on AI in wargames, from which we
construct an ontology of wargames in terms of the creativity afforded to either
the players or adjudicators. Focusing on the space of wargames with the most
open-endedness for players and adjudicators, we distill a set of considerations
for when and how to use LMs in different application areas. We also present a
set of safety considerations, best practices for deploying LMs in open-ended
wargames, and conclude with a set of high-impact open research challenges.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为超并行缩放（hyper-parallel scaling）的框架，通过在token级别计算和聚合多个输出提案来提升大型语言模型的生成质量。该方法在混合专家模型（MoE）中实现为专家名册（RoE），这是一种无需训练即可提升推理性能的算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的推理时序列级缩放方法（如思维链）主要关注序列级别的改进，而token级别的预测质量提升仍有空间。作者希望开发一种互补框架，在token级别提升预测准确性。

Method: RoE算法通过向专家路由机制注入受控随机性，为每个token采样多个不同的专家，并聚合它们的输出以获得更准确的最终预测。同时引入了高效的批处理策略和专门的KV缓存机制来降低计算和内存开销。

Result: 实验表明，RoE使7B参数的MoE模型能够达到10.5B参数MoE模型的性能，同时推理计算量减少30%。这些性能提升无需对模型参数进行任何微调。

Conclusion: 超并行缩放框架为提升LLM推理质量提供了一种有效的新途径，特别是在MoE模型中，RoE算法能够在不增加训练成本的情况下显著提升模型性能。

Abstract: The generation quality of large language models (LLMs) is often improved by
utilizing inference-time sequence-level scaling methods (e.g.,
Chain-of-Thought). We introduce hyper-parallel scaling, a complementary
framework that improves prediction quality at the token level. Hyper-parallel
scaling computes and aggregates multiple output proposals for a single token
from the model. We implement this concept in Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) models,
which we refer to as Roster of Experts (RoE). RoE is a training-free inference
algorithm that turns a single MoE into a dynamic ensemble of MoEs. RoE injects
controlled stochasticity into the expert routing mechanism, enabling it to
sample multiple diverse experts for each token and aggregate their outputs for
a more accurate final prediction.To overcome the computational cost, we
introduce an efficient batching strategy and a specialized KV-caching mechanism
that minimizes compute and memory overhead. For example, RoE enables a 7B MoE
model to match the performance of a 10.5B MoE model while using 30% less
compute for inference. These gains are achieved without any fine-tuning of
model parameters.

Conclusion: 虽然早期结果令人鼓舞，但这项工作代表了向可扩展、准确的NLP驱动系统迈出的第一步，展示了其在跨学科工作流程中进行严格、领域无关知识聚合的潜力。

Abstract: Systematic Literature Reviews (SLRs) are foundational to evidence-based
research but remain labor-intensive and prone to inconsistency across
disciplines. We present an LLM-based SLR evaluation copilot built on a
Multi-Agent System (MAS) architecture to assist researchers in assessing the
overall quality of the systematic literature reviews. The system automates
protocol validation, methodological assessment, and topic relevance checks
using a scholarly database. Unlike conventional single-agent methods, our
design integrates a specialized agentic approach aligned with PRISMA guidelines
to support more structured and interpretable evaluations. We conducted an
initial study on five published SLRs from diverse domains, comparing system
outputs to expert-annotated PRISMA scores, and observed 84% agreement. While
early results are promising, this work represents a first step toward scalable

their capacity for rigorous, domain-agnostic knowledge aggregation to
streamline the review process.

Result: 评估揭示了模型层面和代理层面漏洞特征的根本差异。发现存在仅代理层面的漏洞，这些攻击向量只在代理执行环境中出现。代理层面的迭代攻击成功实现了在模型层面完全失败的目标，工具调用环境的漏洞率比非工具环境高24%

Conclusion: 独立模型漏洞并不总是能推广到部署系统中，某些模型特定攻击在代理环境中失效，表明需要专门针对代理系统的安全评估方法

Abstract: As the industry increasingly adopts agentic AI systems, understanding their
unique vulnerabilities becomes critical. Prior research suggests that security
flaws at the model level do not fully capture the risks present in agentic
deployments, where models interact with tools and external environments. This
paper investigates this gap by conducting a comparative red teaming analysis of
GPT-OSS-20B, a 20-billion parameter open-source model. Using our observability
framework AgentSeer to deconstruct agentic systems into granular actions and
components, we apply iterative red teaming attacks with harmful objectives from
HarmBench at two distinct levels: the standalone model and the model operating
within an agentic loop. Our evaluation reveals fundamental differences between
model level and agentic level vulnerability profiles. Critically, we discover
the existence of agentic-only vulnerabilities, attack vectors that emerge
exclusively within agentic execution contexts while remaining inert against
standalone models. Agentic level iterative attacks successfully compromise
objectives that completely failed at the model level, with tool-calling
contexts showing 24\% higher vulnerability than non-tool contexts. Conversely,
certain model-specific exploits work exclusively at the model level and fail
when transferred to agentic contexts, demonstrating that standalone model
vulnerabilities do not always generalize to deployed systems.

TL;DR: CogAtom是一个基于认知原子的框架，用于合成数学上严谨且认知多样的问题，通过选择和重组从人类解决方案中提取的基本推理单元来解决奥林匹克级数学问题稀缺的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数学推理对大型语言模型具有挑战性，需要多步推理和抽象概念整合。现有测试时扩展技术严重依赖高质量、具有挑战性的问题，但奥林匹克级数学问题的稀缺性成为瓶颈。

Method: CogAtom将问题构建建模为选择和重组认知原子的过程，使用多样性促进的随机游走算法探索认知原子空间，并通过基于约束的重组机制确保逻辑合理性和结构有效性。

Result: 实验结果表明，CogAtom在准确性、推理深度和多样性方面优于现有方法，生成的问题在难度上接近AIME，但在结构变化上超过AIME。

Conclusion: 这项工作为可扩展、高质量的数学问题生成提供了一条基于认知的途径。

Abstract: Mathematical reasoning poses significant challenges for Large Language Models
(LLMs) due to its demand for multi-step reasoning and abstract conceptual
integration. While recent test-time scaling techniques rely heavily on
high-quality, challenging problems, the scarcity of Olympiad-level math
problems remains a bottleneck. We introduce CogAtom, a novel cognitive
atom-based framework for synthesizing mathematically rigorous and cognitively
diverse problems. Unlike prior approaches, CogAtom models problem construction
as a process of selecting and recombining fundamental reasoning units,
cognitive atoms, extracted from human-authored solutions. A diversity-promoting
random walk algorithm enables exploration of the cognitive atom space, while a
constraint-based recombination mechanism ensures logical soundness and
structural validity. The combinatorial nature of the graph structure provides a
near-infinite space of reasoning paths, and the walk algorithm systematically
explores this space to achieve large-scale synthesis of high-quality problems;
meanwhile, by controlling the number of cognitive atoms, we can precisely
adjust problem difficulty, ensuring diversity, scalability, and controllability
of the generated problems. Experimental results demonstrate that CogAtom
outperforms existing methods in accuracy, reasoning depth, and diversity,
generating problems that closely match the difficulty of AIME while exceeding
it in structural variation. Our work offers a cognitively grounded pathway
toward scalable, high-quality math problem generation.Our code is publicly
available at https://github.com/Icarus-1111/CogAtom.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前软件系统日益复杂，对源代码漏洞分析工具需求增长。现有方法将漏洞分析简化为分类任务，忽略了现实场景的细微差别和上下文依赖性。虽然代码LLM在代码理解方面表现出色，但很少关注安全特定的推理。

Method: 提出LLaVul多模态LLM，训练模型将配对的代码和自然查询整合到统一空间，增强代码漏洞的推理和上下文相关洞察。构建了包含真实世界漏洞的安全焦点问答数据集进行评估。

Result: LLaVul在问答和检测任务中优于现有最先进的通用和代码LLM。通过定性分析解释了决策过程，突出了模型的能力和局限性。

Conclusion: 通过整合代码和问答，LLaVul实现了更具可解释性和安全焦点的代码理解。

Abstract: Increasing complexity in software systems places a growing demand on
reasoning tools that unlock vulnerabilities manifest in source code. Many
current approaches focus on vulnerability analysis as a classifying task,
oversimplifying the nuanced and context-dependent real-world scenarios. Even
though current code large language models (LLMs) excel in code understanding,
they often pay little attention to security-specific reasoning. We propose
LLaVul, a multimodal LLM tailored to provide fine-grained reasoning about code
through question-answering (QA). Our model is trained to integrate paired code
and natural queries into a unified space, enhancing reasoning and
context-dependent insights about code vulnerability. To evaluate our model
performance, we construct a curated dataset of real-world vulnerabilities
paired with security-focused questions and answers. Our model outperforms
state-of-the-art general-purpose and code LLMs in the QA and detection tasks.
We further explain decision-making by conducting qualitative analysis to
highlight capabilities and limitations. By integrating code and QA, LLaVul
enables more interpretable and security-focused code understanding.

Conclusion: 通过将评估协议与LLM开发生命周期对齐，该基准为可信赖的基于偏差的放射学报告生成建立了路径。

Abstract: Automating radiology report generation poses a dual challenge: building
clinically reliable systems and designing rigorous evaluation protocols. We
introduce a multi-agent reinforcement learning framework that serves as both a
benchmark and evaluation environment for multimodal clinical reasoning in the
radiology ecosystem. The proposed framework integrates large language models
(LLMs) and large vision models (LVMs) within a modular architecture composed of
ten specialized agents responsible for image analysis, feature extraction,
report generation, review, and evaluation. This design enables fine-grained
assessment at both the agent level (e.g., detection and segmentation accuracy)
and the consensus level (e.g., report quality and clinical relevance). We
demonstrate an implementation using chatGPT-4o on public radiology datasets,
where LLMs act as evaluators alongside medical radiologist feedback. By
aligning evaluation protocols with the LLM development lifecycle, including
pretraining, finetuning, alignment, and deployment, the proposed benchmark
establishes a path toward trustworthy deviance-based radiology report
generation.

Motivation: 车道变换是高速公路事故的主要原因，现有方法受限于二分类、场景多样性不足以及在长预测时间下性能下降的问题。

Method: 提出物理信息AI框架，整合车辆运动学、交互可行性和交通安全指标，将车道变换预测建模为三分类问题（左变换、右变换、不变换），使用LightGBM等机器学习模型。

Result: 在highD数据集上达到99.8%准确率和93.6%宏F1分数，在exiD数据集上达到96.1%准确率和88.7%宏F1分数，优于双层堆叠LSTM基线。

Conclusion: 物理信息和特征丰富的机器学习框架在自动驾驶系统的实时车道变换意图预测中具有实际优势。

Abstract: Lane-change maneuvers are a leading cause of highway accidents, underscoring
the need for accurate intention prediction to improve the safety and
decision-making of autonomous driving systems. While prior studies using
machine learning and deep learning methods (e.g., SVM, CNN, LSTM, Transformers)
have shown promise, most approaches remain limited by binary classification,
lack of scenario diversity, and degraded performance under longer prediction
horizons. In this study, we propose a physics-informed AI framework that
explicitly integrates vehicle kinematics, interaction feasibility, and
traffic-safety metrics (e.g., distance headway, time headway,
time-to-collision, closing gap time) into the learning process. lane-change
prediction is formulated as a three-class problem that distinguishes left
change, right change, and no change, and is evaluated across both straight
highway segments (highD) and complex ramp scenarios (exiD). By integrating
vehicle kinematics with interaction features, our machine learning models,
particularly LightGBM, achieve state-of-the-art accuracy and strong
generalization. Results show up to 99.8% accuracy and 93.6% macro F1 on highD,
and 96.1% accuracy and 88.7% macro F1 on exiD at a 1-second horizon,
outperforming a two-layer stacked LSTM baseline. These findings demonstrate the
practical advantages of a physics-informed and feature-rich machine learning
framework for real-time lane-change intention prediction in autonomous driving
systems.

TL;DR: 该研究对LLMs和LRMs进行了系统性因果分析，发现RLVR训练的LRMs展现出更强的因果推理能力，而LLMs和蒸馏LRMs未能解决因果相关缺陷。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLMs存在不忠实、偏见和不一致等关键推理问题，因为它们缺乏稳健的因果基础。虽然LRMs通过强化学习和蒸馏等技术提高了任务准确性，但这些训练方法对因果性的影响尚未被充分探索。

Method: 研究使用结构因果模型(SCMs)分析四个关键变量：问题指令(Z)、思考过程(T)、推理步骤(X)和答案(Y)，对LLMs和不同训练方法的LRMs进行系统性因果分析。

Result: RLVR训练的LRMs表现出增强的因果推理能力，更接近理想的因果结构，减少了伪相关并加强了真实的因果模式，从而缓解了不忠实性和偏见问题。

Conclusion: RLVR在增强因果推理中发挥关键作用，为设计具有更强因果基础的未来AI系统提供了重要见解。

Abstract: LLMs suffer from critical reasoning issues such as unfaithfulness, bias, and
inconsistency, since they lack robust causal underpinnings and may rely on
superficial correlations rather than genuine understanding. Successive LRMs
have emerged as a promising alternative, leveraging advanced training
techniques such as reinforcement learning (RL) and distillation to improve task
accuracy. However, the impact of these training methods on causality remains
largely unexplored. In this study, we conduct a systematic causal analysis on
LLMs and LRMs, examining structural causal models (SCMs) of four key variables:
problem instruction (Z), thinking process (T), reasoning steps (X), and answer
(Y). Our findings reveal that RLVR-trained LRMs exhibit enhanced causal
reasoning capabilities, aligning more closely with ideal causal structures,
while LLMs and distilled LRMs fail to address causality-related deficiencies.
Our further investigation indicates that RLVR reduces spurious correlations and
strengthens genuine causal patterns, thereby mitigating unfaithfulness and
bias. In addition, our inspection on the dynamics of the RLVR training process
observes a high correlation between reduced spurious features and improved
causal structures, where the causal relationships consistently improve in the
training process. This study contributes to the understanding of causality in
reasoning models, highlights the critical role of RLVR in enhancing causal
reasoning, and provides insights for designing future AI systems with stronger
causal foundations. We release our code and data at

Method: 将程序综合视为在有限假设空间上的主动学习，使用LLM预测选定测试输入的输出，并通过贪婪最大化算法选择输入来最小化LLM查询次数

Result: 在Playgol字符串转换基准和MBPP+ Python代码生成基准上，该方法在准确性和效率方面显著提高了程序综合性能

Conclusion: 转导式程序综合框架有效解决了传统方法在真实场景中的鲁棒性问题，为程序综合任务提供了新的解决方案

Abstract: We introduce transductive program synthesis, a new formulation of the program
synthesis task that explicitly leverages test inputs during synthesis. While
prior approaches to program synthesis--whether based on natural language
descriptions or input-output examples--typically aim to generalize from
training examples, they often struggle with robustness, especially in
real-world settings where training examples are limited and test inputs involve
various edge cases. To address this, we propose a novel framework that improves
robustness by treating synthesis as an active learning over a finite hypothesis
class defined by programs' outputs. We use an LLM to predict outputs for
selected test inputs and eliminate inconsistent hypotheses, where the inputs
are chosen via a greedy maximin algorithm to minimize the number of LLM queries
required. We evaluate our approach on two real-world datasets: Playgol, a
string transformation benchmark, and MBPP+, a Python code generation benchmark.
We demonstrate that our method significantly improves program synthesis in both
accuracy and efficiency. We release our code at

Motivation: 人工通用智能与传统AI的关键区别在于能够执行需要多种能力的复合任务。虽然基于多模态大语言模型的具身智能体具有丰富的感知和交互能力，但其解决复合任务的能力尚未得到充分探索。

Method: 设计了基于幼儿日常活动的复合任务集，在动态模拟家庭环境中评估了17个领先的专有和开源多模态大语言模型，任务涵盖物体理解、空间智能和社交活动三个核心领域。

Result: 所有模型在三个领域都表现不佳，表明当前能力与通用智能要求之间存在显著差距。

Conclusion: 这些任务为评估具身智能体的通用能力提供了初步框架，标志着向开发具身多模态大语言模型及其实际部署迈出了重要一步。

Abstract: A key feature differentiating artificial general intelligence (AGI) from
traditional AI is that AGI can perform composite tasks that require a wide
range of capabilities. Although embodied agents powered by multimodal large
language models (MLLMs) offer rich perceptual and interactive capabilities, it
remains largely unexplored whether they can solve composite tasks. In the
current work, we designed a set of composite tasks inspired by common daily
activities observed in early childhood development. Within a dynamic and
simulated home environment, these tasks span three core domains: object
understanding, spatial intelligence, and social activity. We evaluated 17
leading proprietary and open-source MLLMs on these tasks. The results
consistently showed poor performance across all three domains, indicating a
substantial gap between current capabilities and general intelligence
requirements. Together, our tasks offer a preliminary framework for evaluating
the general capabilities of embodied agents, marking an early but significant
step toward the development of embodied MLLMs and their real-world deployment.

Motivation: 受人类大脑通过突触稳态实现动态稳定-可塑性平衡的生物原理启发，解决实际应用中不断出现具有个体间变异性的新个体的连续EEG解码问题。

Method: SPICED框架包含新颖的突触网络，通过三种生物启发神经机制实现连续适应：关键记忆重新激活、突触巩固和突触重归一化，这些机制在突触稳态中相互作用，动态增强任务判别性记忆痕迹并削弱有害记忆。

Result: 在三个EEG数据集上的验证表明，SPICED通过优先重放与新出现个体强关联的任务判别性记忆痕迹实现鲁棒适应，同时在长期连续学习中通过抑制有害记忆的重放优先级有效缓解灾难性遗忘。

Conclusion: SPICED框架成功地将生物突触稳态机制整合到连续学习系统中，为处理个体间变异性的连续EEG解码提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Human brain achieves dynamic stability-plasticity balance through synaptic
homeostasis. Inspired by this biological principle, we propose SPICED: a
neuromorphic framework that integrates the synaptic homeostasis mechanism for
unsupervised continual EEG decoding, particularly addressing practical
scenarios where new individuals with inter-individual variability emerge
continually. SPICED comprises a novel synaptic network that enables dynamic
expansion during continual adaptation through three bio-inspired neural
mechanisms: (1) critical memory reactivation; (2) synaptic consolidation and
(3) synaptic renormalization. The interplay within synaptic homeostasis
dynamically strengthens task-discriminative memory traces and weakens
detrimental memories. By integrating these mechanisms with continual learning
system, SPICED preferentially replays task-discriminative memory traces that
exhibit strong associations with newly emerging individuals, thereby achieving
robust adaptations. Meanwhile, SPICED effectively mitigates catastrophic
forgetting by suppressing the replay prioritization of detrimental memories
during long-term continual learning. Validated on three EEG datasets, SPICED
show its effectiveness.

Abstract: The pursuit of artificial general intelligence continuously demands
generalization in one model across myriad tasks, even those not seen before.
However, current AI models are isolated from each other for being limited to
specific tasks, now first defined as Intelligence Islands. To unify
Intelligence Islands into one, we propose Pangaea, the first AI supercontinent
akin to the geological Pangaea. Pangaea encodes any data into a unified format
and accumulates universal knowledge through pre-training on 296 datasets across
diverse modalities. Eventually, it demonstrates remarkable generalization
across 45 general tasks and 15 scientific tasks encompassing a wide range of
scientific subjects. By investigating Pangaea deeper, the scaling effect of
modality is revealed, quantifying the universal knowledge accumulation across
modalities as the cumulative distribution function of a geometric distribution.
On the whole, Pangaea shows strong potential to handle myriad tasks, indicating
a new direction toward artificial general intelligence.

Abstract: The increasing availability of open Earth Observation (EO) and agricultural
datasets holds great potential for supporting sustainable land management.
However, their high technical entry barrier limits accessibility for non-expert
users. This study presents an open-source conversational assistant that
integrates multimodal retrieval and large language models (LLMs) to enable
natural language interaction with heterogeneous agricultural and geospatial
data. The proposed architecture combines orthophotos, Sentinel-2 vegetation
indices, and user-provided documents through retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG), allowing the system to flexibly determine whether to rely on multimodal
evidence, textual knowledge, or both in formulating an answer. To assess
response quality, we adopt an LLM-as-a-judge methodology using Qwen3-32B in a
zero-shot, unsupervised setting, applying direct scoring in a multi-dimensional
quantitative evaluation framework. Preliminary results show that the system is
capable of generating clear, relevant, and context-aware responses to
agricultural queries, while remaining reproducible and scalable across
geographic regions. The primary contributions of this work include an
architecture for fusing multimodal EO and textual knowledge sources, a
demonstration of lowering the barrier to access specialized agricultural
information through natural language interaction, and an open and reproducible
design.

Abstract: As generative models are advancing in quality and quantity for creating
synthetic content, deepfakes begin to cause online mistrust. Deepfake detectors
are proposed to counter this effect, however, misuse of detectors claiming fake
content as real or vice versa further fuels this misinformation problem. We
present the first comprehensive uncertainty analysis of deepfake detectors,
systematically investigating how generative artifacts influence prediction
confidence. As reflected in detectors' responses, deepfake generators also
contribute to this uncertainty as their generative residues vary, so we cross
the uncertainty analysis of deepfake detectors and generators. Based on our
observations, the uncertainty manifold holds enough consistent information to
leverage uncertainty for deepfake source detection. Our approach leverages
Bayesian Neural Networks and Monte Carlo dropout to quantify both aleatoric and
epistemic uncertainties across diverse detector architectures. We evaluate
uncertainty on two datasets with nine generators, with four blind and two
biological detectors, compare different uncertainty methods, explore region-
and pixel-based uncertainty, and conduct ablation studies. We conduct and
analyze binary real/fake, multi-class real/fake, source detection, and
leave-one-out experiments between the generator/detector combinations to share
their generalization capability, model calibration, uncertainty, and robustness
against adversarial attacks. We further introduce uncertainty maps that
localize prediction confidence at the pixel level, revealing distinct patterns
correlated with generator-specific artifacts. Our analysis provides critical
insights for deploying reliable deepfake detection systems and establishes
uncertainty quantification as a fundamental requirement for trustworthy
synthetic media detection.

Result: 实验结果表明MontePrep在五个最先进竞争对手中表现出显著优势

Conclusion: MontePrep框架有效解决了自动数据准备中的实际应用限制，提供了一种高效且无需目标实例的解决方案

Abstract: In commercial systems, a pervasive requirement for automatic data preparation
(ADP) is to transfer relational data from disparate sources to targets with
standardized schema specifications. Previous methods rely on labor-intensive
supervision signals or target table data access permissions, limiting their
usage in real-world scenarios. To tackle these challenges, we propose an
effective end-to-end ADP framework MontePrep, which enables training-free
pipeline synthesis with zero target-instance requirements. MontePrep is
formulated as an open-source large language model (LLM) powered tree-structured
search problem. It consists of three pivot components, i.e., a data preparation
action sandbox (DPAS), a fundamental pipeline generator (FPG), and an
execution-aware pipeline optimizer (EPO). We first introduce DPAS, a
lightweight action sandbox, to navigate the search-based pipeline generation.
The design of DPAS circumvents exploration of infeasible pipelines. Then, we
present FPG to build executable DP pipelines incrementally, which explores the
predefined action sandbox by the LLM-powered Monte Carlo Tree Search.
Furthermore, we propose EPO, which invokes pipeline execution results from
sources to targets to evaluate the reliability of the generated pipelines in
FPG. In this way, unreasonable pipelines are eliminated, thus facilitating the
search process from both efficiency and effectiveness perspectives. Extensive
experimental results demonstrate the superiority of MontePrep with significant
improvement against five state-of-the-art competitors.

executing solutions through self-directed engagement with environments and
tools. This fundamental capability marks the dawn of the Age of AI Agency,
driven by a critical industry shift: the urgent need for AI systems that don't
just think, but work. While current AI excels at reasoning and generating
responses, industries demand autonomous agents that can execute tasks, operate
tools, and drive real-world outcomes. As agentic intelligence becomes the
defining characteristic separating cognitive systems from productive workers,
efficiently cultivating machine autonomy becomes paramount. Current approaches
assume that more data yields better agency, following traditional scaling laws
from language modeling. We fundamentally challenge this paradigm. LIMI (Less Is
More for Intelligent Agency) demonstrates that agency follows radically
different development principles. Through strategic focus on collaborative
software development and scientific research workflows, we show that
sophisticated agentic intelligence can emerge from minimal but strategically
curated demonstrations of autonomous behavior. Using only 78 carefully designed
training samples, LIMI achieves 73.5% on comprehensive agency benchmarks,
dramatically outperforming state-of-the-art models: Kimi-K2-Instruct (24.1%),
DeepSeek-V3.1 (11.9%), Qwen3-235B-A22B-Instruct (27.5%), and GLM-4.5 (45.1%).
Most strikingly, LIMI demonstrates 53.7% improvement over models trained on
10,000 samples-achieving superior agentic intelligence with 128 times fewer
samples. Our findings establish the Agency Efficiency Principle: machine
autonomy emerges not from data abundance but from strategic curation of
high-quality agentic demonstrations.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于强化多模态大语言模型的表格图像到LaTeX代码生成方法，通过结构级和视觉保真度双重奖励机制，显著提升了复杂表格的生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在处理具有大尺寸、深层嵌套结构和语义丰富内容的复杂表格时效果不佳，需要开发能够准确重建高质量、可发布表格的自动化方法。

Method: 采用预训练多模态大语言模型在大规模表格到LaTeX数据集上进行微调，并引入基于Group Relative Policy Optimization的双重奖励强化学习策略，结合LaTeX代码结构级奖励和渲染输出的视觉保真度奖励。

Result: 在结合TEDS-Structure和CW-SSIM的混合评估协议下，该方法在复杂表格上达到了最先进的性能表现。

Conclusion: 所提出的强化多模态大语言模型框架在表格图像到LaTeX代码生成任务中表现出有效性和鲁棒性，特别是在处理结构复杂表格方面具有显著优势。

Abstract: In this work, we address the task of table image to LaTeX code generation,
with the goal of automating the reconstruction of high-quality,
publication-ready tables from visual inputs. A central challenge of this task
lies in accurately handling complex tables -- those with large sizes, deeply
nested structures, and semantically rich or irregular cell content -- where
existing methods often fail. We begin with a comprehensive analysis,
identifying key challenges and highlighting the limitations of current
evaluation protocols. To overcome these issues, we propose a reinforced
multimodal large language model (MLLM) framework, where a pre-trained MLLM is
fine-tuned on a large-scale table-to-LaTeX dataset. To further improve
generation quality, we introduce a dual-reward reinforcement learning strategy
based on Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Unlike standard approaches
that optimize purely over text outputs, our method incorporates both a
structure-level reward on LaTeX code and a visual fidelity reward computed from
rendered outputs, enabling direct optimization of the visual output quality. We
adopt a hybrid evaluation protocol combining TEDS-Structure and CW-SSIM, and
show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, particularly on
structurally complex tables, demonstrating the effectiveness and robustness of
our approach.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: EngiBench是一个分层基准测试，用于评估大语言模型在解决工程问题上的能力，涵盖三个难度级别和多种工程子领域，通过系统改写问题来分别评估模型的鲁棒性、领域知识和数学推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试未能捕捉真实世界工程问题的复杂性（如不确定性、上下文和开放式场景），而大语言模型在良好条件下的数学推理表现良好，但缺乏对工程问题的评估。

Method: 设计EngiBench分层基准，包含三个难度级别（基础知识检索、多步上下文推理、开放式建模），并将每个问题系统改写为三个变体（扰动、知识增强、数学抽象）来分别评估不同能力。

Result: 实验结果显示模型在不同难度级别上存在明显性能差距：任务越难表现越差，问题稍有变化时性能下降，在高级工程任务上远落后于人类专家。

Conclusion: 当前大语言模型仍缺乏真实世界工程所需的高级推理能力，未来需要开发具有更深层次和更可靠问题解决能力的模型。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown strong performance on mathematical
reasoning under well-posed conditions. However, real-world engineering problems
require more than mathematical symbolic computation -- they need to deal with
uncertainty, context, and open-ended scenarios. Existing benchmarks fail to
capture these complexities. We introduce EngiBench, a hierarchical benchmark
designed to evaluate LLMs on solving engineering problems. It spans three
levels of increasing difficulty (foundational knowledge retrieval, multi-step
contextual reasoning, and open-ended modeling) and covers diverse engineering
subfields. To facilitate a deeper understanding of model performance, we
systematically rewrite each problem into three controlled variants (perturbed,
knowledge-enhanced, and math abstraction), enabling us to separately evaluate
the model's robustness, domain-specific knowledge, and mathematical reasoning
abilities. Experiment results reveal a clear performance gap across levels:
models struggle more as tasks get harder, perform worse when problems are
slightly changed, and fall far behind human experts on the high-level
engineering tasks. These findings reveal that current LLMs still lack the
high-level reasoning needed for real-world engineering, highlighting the need
for future models with deeper and more reliable problem-solving capabilities.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种改进的软弧一致性算法来处理线性约束，相比原有算法能显著提高下界，在某些情况下减少求解时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在约束规划中，解决离散最小化问题时，现有方法存在局限性：软全局约束的下界较弱，线性规划重构的规模可能过大。软弧一致性算法能提供中等质量的下界，但需要适应线性约束以增强建模表达能力。

Method: 改进现有的软弧一致性算法，使其能够处理作为局部成本函数的线性约束。

Result: 新算法在多个基准测试中相比原始算法显著提高了下界，在某些情况下减少了求解时间。

Conclusion: 通过将线性约束整合到软弧一致性框架中，可以在保持建模灵活性的同时获得更好的求解性能。

Abstract: In Constraint Programming, solving discrete minimization problems with hard
and soft constraints can be done either using (i) soft global constraints, (ii)
a reformulation into a linear program, or (iii) a reformulation into local cost
functions. Approach (i) benefits from a vast catalog of constraints. Each soft
constraint propagator communicates with other soft constraints only through the
variable domains, resulting in weak lower bounds. Conversely, the approach (ii)
provides a global view with strong bounds, but the size of the reformulation
can be problematic. We focus on approach (iii) in which soft arc consistency
(SAC) algorithms produce bounds of intermediate quality. Recently, the
introduction of linear constraints as local cost functions increases their
modeling expressiveness. We adapt an existing SAC algorithm to handle linear
constraints. We show that our algorithm significantly improves the lower bounds
compared to the original algorithm on several benchmarks, reducing solving time
in some cases.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DA-Mamba是一个用于对话场景中人类参与度估计的新型多模态架构，它使用Mamba选择性状态空间处理替代注意力机制，实现了线性时间和内存复杂度，同时保持强大的跨模态推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对话场景中的人类参与度估计对于自适应教学、远程医疗评估和社交感知人机交互等应用至关重要。参与度是通过面部表情、语音、手势和行为线索随时间传递的动态多模态信号。

Method: DA-Mamba架构包含三个核心模块：对话感知编码器、模态组融合和伙伴组融合。这些Mamba基础的融合机制实现了表达性对话理解，通过选择性状态空间处理实现高效的跨模态推理。

Result: 在三个标准基准测试（NoXi、NoXi-Add和MPIIGI）上的广泛实验表明，DA-Mamba在一致性相关系数（CCC）上超越了先前的最先进方法，同时减少了训练时间和峰值内存使用，能够处理更长的序列并促进在资源受限的多方对话设置中的实时部署。

Conclusion: DA-Mamba通过Mamba选择性状态空间处理成功解决了传统注意力机制在长序列处理中的计算效率问题，为多模态参与度估计提供了高效且有效的解决方案，具有实际部署的潜力。

Abstract: Human engagement estimation in conversational scenarios is essential for
applications such as adaptive tutoring, remote healthcare assessment, and
socially aware human--computer interaction. Engagement is a dynamic, multimodal
signal conveyed by facial expressions, speech, gestures, and behavioral cues
over time. In this work we introduce DA-Mamba, a dialogue-aware multimodal
architecture that replaces attention-heavy dialogue encoders with Mamba-based
selective state-space processing to achieve linear time and memory complexity
while retaining expressive cross-modal reasoning. We design a Mamba
dialogue-aware selective state-space model composed of three core modules: a
Dialogue-Aware Encoder, and two Mamba-based fusion mechanisms: Modality-Group
Fusion and Partner-Group Fusion, these modules achieve expressive dialogue
understanding. Extensive experiments on three standard benchmarks (NoXi,
NoXi-Add, and MPIIGI) show that DA-Mamba surpasses prior state-of-the-art
(SOTA) methods in concordance correlation coefficient (CCC), while reducing
training time and peak memory; these gains enable processing much longer
sequences and facilitate real-time deployment in resource-constrained,
multi-party conversational settings. The source code will be available at:

*Joao Marques-Silva,Alexey Ignatiev*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文分析了McTavish等人提出的MBDSR方法（基于Quine-McCluskey算法）在决策树预测等价性判定中的问题，指出该方法存在最坏情况指数复杂度且可能产生错误结果，并提出了多项式时间复杂度的替代算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 决策树的Rashomon集合中存在大量预测等价的决策树，这会影响特征重要性分析的准确性。现有MBDSR方法使用Quine-McCluskey算法进行最小DNF表示，但该方法存在计算复杂度和正确性问题。

Method: 首先证明QM方法存在最坏情况指数复杂度，其次展示MBDSR方法在预测等价性判定中可能产生错误结果，最后提出多项式时间复杂度的替代算法来解决相关问题。

Result: 实验证实，对于触发QM方法最坏情况的决策树，本文提出的算法比McTavish等人的方法快几个数量级。

Conclusion: MBDSR方法存在严重缺陷，而本文提出的多项式时间算法能够更高效且正确地解决决策树预测等价性判定及相关问题。

Abstract: The Rashomon set of decision trees (DTs) finds importance uses. Recent work
showed that DTs computing the same classification function, i.e. predictive
equivalent DTs, can represent a significant fraction of the Rashomon set. Such
redundancy is undesirable. For example, feature importance based on the
Rashomon set becomes inaccurate due the existence of predictive equivalent DTs,
i.e. DTs with the same prediction for every possible input. In recent work,
McTavish et al. proposed solutions for several computational problems related
with DTs, including that of deciding predictive equivalent DTs. This approach,
which this paper refers to as MBDSR, consists of applying the well-known method
of Quine-McCluskey (QM) for obtaining minimum-size DNF (disjunctive normal
form) representations of DTs, which are then used for comparing DTs for
predictive equivalence. Furthermore, the minimum-size DNF representation was
also applied to computing explanations for the predictions made by DTs, and to
finding predictions in the presence of missing data. However, the problem of
formula minimization is hard for the second level of the polynomial hierarchy,
and the QM method may exhibit worst-case exponential running time and space.
This paper first demonstrates that there exist decision trees that trigger the
worst-case exponential running time and space of the QM method. Second, the
paper shows that the MBDSR approach can produce incorrect results for the
problem of deciding predictive equivalence. Third, the paper shows that any of
the problems to which the minimum-size DNF representation has been applied to
can in fact be solved in polynomial time, in the size of the DT. The
experiments confirm that, for DTs for which the the worst-case of the QM method
is triggered, the algorithms proposed in this paper are orders of magnitude
faster than the ones proposed by McTavish et al.

TL;DR: 本文提出TTS-Uniform框架，通过识别多种推理策略、均匀分配采样预算并过滤不稳定策略，来解决测试时缩放中的推理策略选择偏差问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究表明测试时缩放能提升大语言模型性能，但忽略了推理策略选择偏差问题——模型倾向于使用某些策略而忽略其他有效策略，导致解空间探索不足。

Method: 提出TTS-Uniform框架：1）识别潜在推理策略；2）均匀分配采样预算；3）在聚合前过滤不稳定策略。

Result: 实验结果表明，TTS-Uniform在多个主流大语言模型和基准数据集上显著提升了缩放效果。

Conclusion: 通过理论分析和实验验证，TTS-Uniform能有效缓解推理策略选择偏差，提高测试时缩放的有效性。

Abstract: Test-time scaling (TTS) has been shown to improve the performance of large
language models (LLMs) by sampling and aggregating diverse reasoning paths.
However, existing research has overlooked a critical issue: selection bias of
reasoning strategies during scaling. Specifically, when generating reasoning
processes, LLMs tend to follow certain strategies (e.g., algebraic solutions
for math problems) while neglecting other valid alternatives (e.g., geometric
solutions), resulting in insufficient exploration of the solution space. To
further understand the impact of this bias, we present a theoretical analysis
that reveals when it undermines the effectiveness of test-time scaling.
Motivated by this theoretical insight, we introduce TTS-Uniform, a framework
designed to mitigate the selection bias of reasoning strategies. It (i)
identifies potential strategies, (ii) uniformly allocates the sampling budget
across them, and (iii) filters out unstable strategies prior to aggregation.
Experimental results show that TTS-Uniform significantly enhances scaling
effectiveness across multiple mainstream LLMs and benchmark datasets.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有T2I评估方法缺乏应用场景视角，且ELO和MOS方法各有局限性，需要更系统、实用的评估框架。

Method: 提出结构化分类法构建Magic-Bench-377基准，结合ELO和维度特定MOS进行联合评估，使用多元逻辑回归分析各维度对用户满意度的贡献。

Result: 应用MEF框架获得当前T2I模型的排行榜和关键特征，框架和基准数据集已开源。

Conclusion: MEF框架为视觉生成模型评估提供了系统化方法，支持标签级评估和平衡覆盖用户场景与能力。

Abstract: Rapid advances in text-to-image (T2I) generation have raised higher
requirements for evaluation methodologies. Existing benchmarks center on
objective capabilities and dimensions, but lack an application-scenario
perspective, limiting external validity. Moreover, current evaluations
typically rely on either ELO for overall ranking or MOS for dimension-specific
scoring, yet both methods have inherent shortcomings and limited
interpretability. Therefore, we introduce the Magic Evaluation Framework (MEF),
a systematic and practical approach for evaluating T2I models. First, we
propose a structured taxonomy encompassing user scenarios, elements, element
compositions, and text expression forms to construct the Magic-Bench-377, which
supports label-level assessment and ensures a balanced coverage of both user
scenarios and capabilities. On this basis, we combine ELO and
dimension-specific MOS to generate model rankings and fine-grained assessments
respectively. This joint evaluation method further enables us to quantitatively
analyze the contribution of each dimension to user satisfaction using
multivariate logistic regression. By applying MEF to current T2I models, we
obtain a leaderboard and key characteristics of the leading models. We release
our evaluation framework and make Magic-Bench-377 fully open-source to advance
research in the evaluation of visual generative models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GUI代理模型面临奖励信号不可靠和在线轨迹生成有限的问题，需要提高推理可靠性和数据效率。

Method: 整合原则约束奖励建模和在线虚拟机轨迹构建，利用环境可验证和LLM衍生的原则来约束推理过程，并通过虚拟机自主收集结构化GUI交互轨迹。

Result: 在标准GUI基准测试中，Orcust在ScreenSpot和ScreenSpot-Pro上分别比基础模型提高了22.2%和23.9%，实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: Orcust有效提升了GUI代理在各种环境和任务复杂度下的推理能力、适应性和可扩展性。

Abstract: Recent advances in GUI agents have achieved remarkable grounding and
action-prediction performance, yet existing models struggle with unreliable
reward signals and limited online trajectory generation. In this paper, we
introduce Orcust, a framework that integrates Principle-Constrained Reward
Modeling (PCRM) and Online VM-Grounded Trajectory Construction (OVTC) to
enhance reasoning reliability and data efficiency in interactive GUI tasks. We
leverages environment-verifiable and LLM-derived principle to enforce
interpretable reward signals that constrain long chain-of-thought reasoning and
rule-based feedback. OVTC spins up instrumented virtual machines to
autonomously collect structured GUI interaction trajectories with explicit
procedural and structural objectives, enabling the training of a stepwise
reward model that robustly captures human preferences and adheres to
task-specific constraints. Extensive experiments on standard GUI benchmarks
covering perceptual grounding, foundational operations, and end-to-end task
execution reveal that Orcust achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving
by 22.2\% on ScreenSpot and 23.9\% on ScreenSpot-Pro over the base model (i.e.
Qwen2.5-VL-7B). The results demonstrate Orcust's effectiveness in enhancing the
reasoning, adaptability and scalability of GUI agents across various
environments and task complexities.

Motivation: 现有AI公平性评估主要由AI专家主导，但缺乏对受AI决策影响但无AI专业知识的利益相关者如何评估公平性的了解

Method: 对30名无AI专业知识的利益相关者进行定性研究，在信用评级场景中让他们决定特征优先级、指标和阈值

Result: 利益相关者的公平性决策比AI专家实践更复杂：考虑超出法律保护的特征、为特定情境定制指标、设置多样化且更严格的公平阈值，甚至偏好设计定制化公平性

Conclusion: 研究结果扩展了对利益相关者如何有意义地参与AI公平性治理和缓解的理解，强调了纳入利益相关者细致公平判断的重要性

Abstract: Assessing fairness in artificial intelligence (AI) typically involves AI
experts who select protected features, fairness metrics, and set fairness
thresholds. However, little is known about how stakeholders, particularly those
affected by AI outcomes but lacking AI expertise, assess fairness. To address
this gap, we conducted a qualitative study with 30 stakeholders without AI
expertise, representing potential decision subjects in a credit rating
scenario, to examine how they assess fairness when placed in the role of
deciding on features with priority, metrics, and thresholds. We reveal that
stakeholders' fairness decisions are more complex than typical AI expert
practices: they considered features far beyond legally protected features,
tailored metrics for specific contexts, set diverse yet stricter fairness
thresholds, and even preferred designing customized fairness. Our results
extend the understanding of how stakeholders can meaningfully contribute to AI
fairness governance and mitigation, underscoring the importance of
incorporating stakeholders' nuanced fairness judgments.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种形式化框架，将信念更新建模为动机驱动的变分决策过程，认为常见的认知偏差（如确认偏误）并非认知缺陷，而是对信念修订成本的适应性反应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统观点认为认知偏差是缺陷，但作者认为这些偏差是对信念修订的高成本和认知负担的适应性响应，需要建立更全面的模型来解释信念更新的动机机制。

Method: 使用变分决策框架，将信念更新视为权衡信念效用与信息成本（通过Kullback-Leibler散度量化）的过程，并进行计算实验验证模型。

Result: 计算实验表明，简单的资源理性模型能够定性模拟常见的人类行为模式，包括确认偏误和态度极化现象。

Conclusion: 该框架为理解信念变化的动机贝叶斯机制提供了更全面的解释，并为预测、补偿和纠正信念更新过程中的偏差提供了实用见解。

Abstract: The human mind is capable of extraordinary achievements, yet it often appears
to work against itself. It actively defends its cherished beliefs even in the
face of contradictory evidence, conveniently interprets information to conform
to desired narratives, and selectively searches for or avoids information to
suit its various purposes. Despite these behaviours deviating from common
normative standards for belief updating, we argue that such 'biases' are not
inherently cognitive flaws, but rather an adaptive response to the significant
pragmatic and cognitive costs associated with revising one's beliefs. This
paper introduces a formal framework that aims to model the influence of these
costs on our belief updating mechanisms.
  We treat belief updating as a motivated variational decision, where agents
weigh the perceived 'utility' of a belief against the informational cost
required to adopt a new belief state, quantified by the Kullback-Leibler
divergence from the prior to the variational posterior. We perform
computational experiments to demonstrate that simple instantiations of this
resource-rational model can be used to qualitatively emulate commonplace human
behaviours, including confirmation bias and attitude polarisation. In doing so,
we suggest that this framework makes steps toward a more holistic account of
the motivated Bayesian mechanics of belief change and provides practical
insights for predicting, compensating for, and correcting deviations from
desired belief updating processes.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型推理模型在复杂长时程任务中表现出可靠性不足和透明度缺失的问题，存在"思考幻觉"，需要开发能够培养稳健问题解决过程的方法。

Method: 采用结构化苏格拉底对话框架，通过意识转移包(CTP)和游戏循环机制，实施事前战略论证和状态锁定校验和，防止错误累积。

Result: 在复杂策略游戏"Caps i Caps"的25步案例研究中，代理不仅解决了高复杂度谜题，还展示了二阶代理能力，能够识别自身计划缺陷并调整核心完整性协议。

Conclusion: STAR-XAI协议为创建高性能、透明、可审计且值得信赖的AI代理提供了实用路径。

Abstract: Current Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) exhibit significant limitations in
reliability and transparency, often showing a collapse in reasoning
capabilities when faced with high-complexity, long-horizon tasks. This
"illusion of thinking" is frequently an artifact of non-agentic, black-box
evaluation paradigms that fail to cultivate robust problem-solving processes.
In response, we introduce The STAR-XAI Protocol (Socratic, Transparent,
Agentic, Reasoning - for eXplainable Artificial Intelligence), a novel
methodology for training and operating verifiably reliable AI agents. Our
method reframes the human-AI interaction as a structured, Socratic dialogue,
governed by an explicit and evolving rulebook, the Consciousness Transfer
Package (CTP). Through an interactive Gameplay Cycle that enforces ante-hoc
strategic justification and a state-locking Checksum that prevents error
accumulation, the protocol transforms a powerful but opaque LRM into a
disciplined "Clear Box" agent. We demonstrate the efficacy of this method
through an exhaustive 25-move case study in the complex strategic game "Caps i
Caps". The agent not only solved the high-complexity puzzle but also
demonstrated Second-Order Agency, identifying flaws in its own
supervisor-approved plans and adapting its core integrity protocols mid-task.
The STAR-XAI Protocol offers a practical pathway to creating AI agents that are
not just high-performing, but also transparent, auditable, and trustworthy by
design.

Motivation: LLMs在现实世界工具交互中经常失败，原因包括参数化错误、工具选择不当或用户意图误解，这些问题源于对用户目标理解不完整和对工具文档理解不足。

Method: 引入课程学习启发的框架，利用结构化推理模板来指导LLMs通过更谨慎的逐步指令生成函数调用。

Conclusion: 该框架增强了工具使用代理的鲁棒性、可解释性和透明度，推动了更可靠的现实世界AI助手的发展。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong reasoning and tool-use
capabilities, yet they often fail in real-world tool-interactions due to
incorrect parameterization, poor tool selection, or misinterpretation of user
intent. These issues often stem from an incomplete understanding of user goals
and inadequate comprehension of tool documentation. While Chain-of-Thought
(CoT) prompting has proven effective for enhancing reasoning in general
contexts, our analysis reveals that free-form CoT is insufficient and sometimes
counterproductive for structured function-calling tasks. To address this, we
introduce a curriculum-inspired framework that leverages structured reasoning
templates to guide LLMs through more deliberate step-by-step instructions for
generating function callings. Experimental results show that our method reduces
tool-use errors, achieving 3-12% relative improvements over strong baselines
across diverse model series and approaches. Moreover, our framework enhances
the robustness, interpretability, and transparency of tool-using agents,
advancing the development of more reliable AI assistants for real-world
applications.

problem distributions, verification via external tools, and continuous

the difficulty of Reasoning Core's tasks, positioning it as a promising
