Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本研究提出了一种基于U-Mamba架构的人机协同机器学习方法，用于3D解剖结构分割和重建，在乳腺MRI数据上取得了优异的分割性能，并改善了术前规划和患者教育。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统分割模型在跨数据集泛化能力方面存在不足，需要开发能够准确分割解剖结构并适用于多样化数据集的算法，以支持有效的术前规划。

Method: 处理120例回顾性乳腺MRI数据，包括匿名化、手动分割T1加权和动态对比增强序列；通过配准分割整个乳房、纤维腺组织和肿瘤；使用ITK-SNAP进行3D可视化；采用人机协同方法利用U-Mamba架构优化分割结果。

Result: U-Mamba模型表现出色：整个器官DSC为0.97±0.013，纤维腺组织为0.96±0.024，肿瘤为0.82±0.12；生成准确的3D重建图像；临床访谈显示改善了术前规划、术中导航和决策支持；3D可视化增强了患者教育和沟通。

Conclusion: 这种人机协同机器学习方法成功实现了跨患者数据集的算法泛化，为临床医生提供了增强的可视化工具，改善了术前规划，并通过更有效的患者教育促进了共同决策和知情选择。

Abstract: Effective preoperative planning requires accurate algorithms for segmenting
anatomical structures across diverse datasets, but traditional models struggle
with generalization. This study presents a novel machine learning methodology
to improve algorithm generalization for 3D anatomical reconstruction beyond
breast cancer applications. We processed 120 retrospective breast MRIs (January
2018-June 2023) through three phases: anonymization and manual segmentation of
T1-weighted and dynamic contrast-enhanced sequences; co-registration and
segmentation of whole breast, fibroglandular tissue, and tumors; and 3D
visualization using ITK-SNAP. A human-in-the-loop approach refined
segmentations using U-Mamba, designed to generalize across imaging scenarios.
Dice similarity coefficient assessed overlap between automated segmentation and
ground truth. Clinical relevance was evaluated through clinician and patient
interviews. U-Mamba showed strong performance with DSC values of 0.97
($\pm$0.013) for whole organs, 0.96 ($\pm$0.024) for fibroglandular tissue, and
0.82 ($\pm$0.12) for tumors on T1-weighted images. The model generated accurate
3D reconstructions enabling visualization of complex anatomical features.
Clinician interviews indicated improved planning, intraoperative navigation,
and decision support. Integration of 3D visualization enhanced patient
education, communication, and understanding. This human-in-the-loop machine
learning approach successfully generalizes algorithms for 3D reconstruction and
anatomical segmentation across patient datasets, offering enhanced
visualization for clinicians, improved preoperative planning, and more
effective patient education, facilitating shared decision-making and empowering
informed patient choices across medical applications.

### [2] [RU-Net for Automatic Characterization of TRISO Fuel Cross Sections](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12244)
*Lu Cai,Fei Xu,Min Xian,Yalei Tang,Shoukun Sun,John Stempien*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 使用卷积神经网络（CNN）自动分割辐照后TRISO燃料颗粒的微观截面图像，以替代传统人工分析方法，提高效率和客观性


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 辐照过程中TRISO颗粒会出现内核膨胀和缓冲层致密化等现象，传统人工显微镜分析数千个颗粒既繁琐又主观，需要自动化解决方案

Method: 构建包含2000多张辐照TRISO颗粒微观图像的数据集，使用RU-Net（本研究开发）、U-Net、ResNet和Attention U-Net等CNN架构进行自动图像分割

Result: 基于RU-Net的模型在交并比（IoU）指标上表现最佳，能够显著加速TRISO颗粒截面分析并提高分割结果的客观性

Conclusion: CNN方法可以有效替代传统人工分析，大幅减少人工劳动并改善TRISO颗粒辐照后形态变化的统计分析

Abstract: During irradiation, phenomena such as kernel swelling and buffer
densification may impact the performance of tristructural isotropic (TRISO)
particle fuel. Post-irradiation microscopy is often used to identify these
irradiation-induced morphologic changes. However, each fuel compact generally
contains thousands of TRISO particles. Manually performing the work to get
statistical information on these phenomena is cumbersome and subjective. To
reduce the subjectivity inherent in that process and to accelerate data
analysis, we used convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to automatically segment
cross-sectional images of microscopic TRISO layers. CNNs are a class of
machine-learning algorithms specifically designed for processing structured
grid data. They have gained popularity in recent years due to their remarkable
performance in various computer vision tasks, including image classification,
object detection, and image segmentation. In this research, we generated a
large irradiated TRISO layer dataset with more than 2,000 microscopic images of
cross-sectional TRISO particles and the corresponding annotated images. Based
on these annotated images, we used different CNNs to automatically segment
different TRISO layers. These CNNs include RU-Net (developed in this study), as
well as three existing architectures: U-Net, Residual Network (ResNet), and
Attention U-Net. The preliminary results show that the model based on RU-Net
performs best in terms of Intersection over Union (IoU). Using CNN models, we
can expedite the analysis of TRISO particle cross sections, significantly
reducing the manual labor involved and improving the objectivity of the
segmentation results.

*Abigail R. Cohen,Yuming Sun,Zhihao Qin,Harsh S. Muriki,Zihao Xiao,Yeonju Lee,Matthew Housley,Andrew F. Sharkey,Rhuanito S. Ferrarezi,Jing Li,Lu Gan,Yongsheng Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一个分层管道，用于作物异常检测和状态估计，结合了自编码器、机器学习和深度学习技术，在资源受限条件下实现高效的养分管理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前养分管理方法需要冗长分析，无法实时优化；成像技术虽然能快速表型分析但计算量大，难以在资源受限条件下部署。需要开发灵活高效的方法来实现实时作物监测和养分管理。

Method: 使用多光谱成像数据，构建分层管道：1）自编码器用于早期异常检测；2）比较两种状态估计模块：基于植被指数的随机森林方法和基于原始图像的视觉变换器深度学习方法。通过养分耗竭实验验证（三种施肥处理：100%、50%、25%）。

Result: 高效异常检测（移植后9天检测到73%的T3样本），能耗远低于浪费氮素的隐含能量。状态估计模块存在权衡：ViT在磷和钙估计上表现更好（R2 0.61 vs 0.58，0.48 vs 0.35），但能耗更高。

Conclusion: 该模块化管道为边缘诊断和农业可持续发展提供了实用机会，实现了效率与准确性之间的平衡，为资源受限环境下的实时作物监测提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Efficient nutrient management is critical for crop growth and sustainable
resource consumption (e.g., nitrogen, energy). Current approaches require
lengthy analyses, preventing real-time optimization; similarly, imaging
facilitates rapid phenotyping but can be computationally intensive, preventing
deployment under resource constraints. This study proposes a flexible, tiered
pipeline for anomaly detection and status estimation (fresh weight, dry mass,
and tissue nutrients), including a comprehensive energy analysis of approaches
that span the efficiency-accuracy spectrum. Using a nutrient depletion
experiment with three treatments (T1-100%, T2-50%, and T3-25% fertilizer
strength) and multispectral imaging (MSI), we developed a hierarchical pipeline
using an autoencoder (AE) for early warning. Further, we compared two status
estimation modules of different complexity for more detailed analysis:
vegetation index (VI) features with machine learning (Random Forest, RF) and
raw whole-image deep learning (Vision Transformer, ViT). Results demonstrated
high-efficiency anomaly detection (73% net detection of T3 samples 9 days after
transplanting) at substantially lower energy than embodied energy in wasted
nitrogen. The state estimation modules show trade-offs, with ViT outperforming
RF on phosphorus and calcium estimation (R2 0.61 vs. 0.58, 0.48 vs. 0.35) at
higher energy cost. With our modular pipeline, this work opens opportunities
for edge diagnostics and practical opportunities for agricultural
sustainability.

### [4] [Humor in Pixels: Benchmarking Large Multimodal Models Understanding of Online Comics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12248)
*Yuriel Ryan,Rui Yang Tan,Kenny Tsu Wei Choo,Roy Ka-Wei Lee*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PixelHumor是一个包含2800个标注多格漫画的基准数据集，用于评估大型多模态模型理解多模态幽默和叙事序列的能力。实验显示当前最先进模型在面板排序任务上仅达到61%准确率，远低于人类表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 幽默理解是社会智能的核心方面，但对大型多模态模型仍是一个重大挑战。需要建立一个评估框架来测试模型在多模态情境和叙事推理方面的能力。

Method: 引入PixelHumor基准数据集，包含2800个标注的多格漫画，用于评估模型的多模态幽默理解和叙事序列识别能力。通过实验测试多个最先进的大型多模态模型。

Result: 实验结果显示当前顶级模型在面板排序任务上仅达到61%准确率，远低于人类表现水平，表明模型在整合视觉和文本线索进行连贯叙事和幽默理解方面存在严重局限。

Conclusion: PixelHumor为评估多模态情境和叙事推理提供了一个严谨框架，旨在推动开发能够更好参与自然、社会意识交互的大型多模态模型。

Abstract: Understanding humor is a core aspect of social intelligence, yet it remains a
significant challenge for Large Multimodal Models (LMMs). We introduce
PixelHumor, a benchmark dataset of 2,800 annotated multi-panel comics designed
to evaluate LMMs' ability to interpret multimodal humor and recognize narrative
sequences. Experiments with state-of-the-art LMMs reveal substantial gaps: for
instance, top models achieve only 61% accuracy in panel sequencing, far below
human performance. This underscores critical limitations in current models'
integration of visual and textual cues for coherent narrative and humor
understanding. By providing a rigorous framework for evaluating multimodal
contextual and narrative reasoning, PixelHumor aims to drive the development of
LMMs that better engage in natural, socially aware interactions.

### [5] [OnlineHOI: Towards Online Human-Object Interaction Generation and Perception](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12250)
*Yihong Ji,Yunze Liu,Yiyao Zhuo,Weijiang Yu,Fei Ma,Joshua Huang,Fei Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了在线人-物交互（HOI）生成与感知新任务，基于Mamba框架开发OnlineHOI网络，在流式数据处理中实现最先进性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前HOI方法基于离线设置，而真实场景需要在线处理，仅能利用当前时刻和历史信息，离线方法在在线环境下表现不佳

Method: 基于Mamba框架构建OnlineHOI网络架构，采用记忆机制有效整合历史信息，利用Mamba对流式数据的强大建模能力

Result: 在Core4D和OAKINK2在线生成任务以及HOI4D在线感知任务上取得了最先进的结果

Conclusion: 在线HOI处理是重要研究方向，提出的OnlineHOI框架通过结合Mamba和记忆机制，有效解决了在线场景下的HOI生成与感知问题

Abstract: The perception and generation of Human-Object Interaction (HOI) are crucial
for fields such as robotics, AR/VR, and human behavior understanding. However,
current approaches model this task in an offline setting, where information at
each time step can be drawn from the entire interaction sequence. In contrast,
in real-world scenarios, the information available at each time step comes only
from the current moment and historical data, i.e., an online setting. We find
that offline methods perform poorly in an online context. Based on this
observation, we propose two new tasks: Online HOI Generation and Perception. To
address this task, we introduce the OnlineHOI framework, a network architecture
based on the Mamba framework that employs a memory mechanism. By leveraging
Mamba's powerful modeling capabilities for streaming data and the Memory
mechanism's efficient integration of historical information, we achieve
state-of-the-art results on the Core4D and OAKINK2 online generation tasks, as
well as the online HOI4D perception task.

### [6] [EfficientNet-Based Multi-Class Detection of Real, Deepfake, and Plastic Surgery Faces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12258)
*Li Kun,Milena Radenkovic*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文分析了深度伪造技术对社会带来的双重影响，既展示了技术进步，也揭示了隐私、声誉和国家安全方面的严重风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨深度学习技术特别是深度伪造在现实应用中的利弊，分析其对个人隐私、公众人物声誉和国家安全的潜在威胁。

Method: 通过分析深度伪造技术的发展现状和应用案例，评估其在人脸识别系统、政治选举和社会信任等方面产生的负面影响。

Result: 深度伪造技术能够产生难以辨别的虚假图像和视频，严重影响面部识别系统的功能，对政治稳定和社会信任构成重大风险。

Conclusion: 深度伪造技术虽然代表了技术进步的成果，但其滥用可能对社会造成深远危害，需要加强监管和技术防范措施。

Abstract: Currently, deep learning has been utilised to tackle several difficulties in
our everyday lives. It not only exhibits progress in computer vision but also
constitutes the foundation for several revolutionary technologies. Nonetheless,
similar to all phenomena, the use of deep learning in diverse domains has
produced a multifaceted interaction of advantages and disadvantages for human
society. Deepfake technology has advanced, significantly impacting social life.
However, developments in this technology can affect privacy, the reputations of
prominent personalities, and national security via software development. It can
produce indistinguishable counterfeit photographs and films, potentially
impairing the functionality of facial recognition systems, so presenting a
significant risk.
  The improper application of deepfake technology produces several detrimental
effects on society. Face-swapping programs mislead users by altering persons'
appearances or expressions to fulfil particular aims or to appropriate personal
information. Deepfake technology permeates daily life through such techniques.
Certain individuals endeavour to sabotage election campaigns or subvert
prominent political figures by creating deceptive pictures to influence public
perception, causing significant harm to a nation's political and economic
structure.

### [7] [A Modern Look at Simplicity Bias in Image Classification Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12265)
*Xiaoguang Chang,Teng Wang,Changyin Sun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文研究了CLIP模型中的简单性偏置（SB）与图像分类任务性能的关系，提出了频率感知的SB测量方法，并发现SB强度与不同任务性能存在相关性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经网络简单性偏置（SB）影响泛化能力，但现有研究多关注小模型或合成任务，缺乏对大模型SB的测量方法及其在实际图像分类任务中作用的研究。

Method: 1）理论分析现有复杂度测量方法的局限性；2）提出频率感知的SB测量方法；3）在CLIP模型上应用两种SB调制方法进行验证；4）分析SB与多种图像分类任务性能的关系。

Result: 新提出的测量方法比现有方法更具信息性和一致性；SB强度与性能表现存在任务依赖性：更强的SB与更好的OOD泛化性能相关，但与对抗鲁棒性表现的关系不同。

Conclusion: 模型归纳偏置与目标任务特性的对齐很重要，SB的调节应根据具体任务需求进行优化。

Abstract: The simplicity Bias (SB) of neural networks, i.e.\ their tendency to
represent simple functions, is a key factor in their generalization
capabilities. Recent studies show that an excessive SB may harm performance on
complex tasks, and the need for this bias varies across tasks. Many of these
studies focus on simple models or synthetic tasks. It remains challenging to
measure the SB in large models and little is known about the relevance of the
SB to various image classification tasks.
  In this paper, we investigate the relationship between the SB in CLIP models
and their performance across image classification tasks. First, we
theoretically analyze the potential limitation of existing measures of
complexity that have been used to characterize small models. To address this,
we propose a frequency-aware measure capturing finer-grained SB differences. We
validate this measure on CLIP models subjected to two recent SB-modulation
methods, demonstrating that it is more informative and consistent than previous
measures. Second, we examine the relation between the SB of those models and
their performance across a range of image classification tasks, including
zero-shot and fine-tuning settings. These experiments reveal a range of
behaviors. For example, a stronger SB correlates with a better performance on
OOD generalization than on adversarial robustness. These results highlight the
benefits of aligning a model's inductive biases with the characteristics of the
target task.

*Mehdi Yousefzadeh,Parsa Esfahanian,Sara Rashidifar,Hossein Salahshoor Gavalan,Negar Sadat Rafiee Tabatabaee,Saeid Gorgin,Dara Rahmati,Maryam Daneshpazhooh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GraphDerm是一个基于群体图神经网络的皮肤镜图像分类框架，首次在ISIC规模上融合了图像、毫米级校准尺度和患者元数据，显著优于仅使用图像的基线方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于图像的AI方法在皮肤镜黑色素瘤分类中往往忽略了患者元数据（年龄、性别、部位）和物理尺度信息，而这些信息对于几何分析和准确诊断至关重要

Method: 使用U-Net进行病变和标尺分割，通过轻量级1D-CNN回归像素-毫米比例，计算真实尺度描述符，构建包含图像特征、元数据和几何相似性的群体图，采用谱图神经网络进行半监督节点分类

Result: 标尺和病变分割Dice分数分别达到0.904和0.908，尺度回归MAE为1.5像素。图模型AUC达到0.9812，稀疏版本（使用约25%边）AUC为0.9788，显著优于图像基线方法的0.9440

Conclusion: 将校准尺度、病变几何和元数据统一在群体图中相比仅使用图像的流程有显著提升，稀疏图能保持接近最优的准确性，尺度感知的图基AI是皮肤镜决策支持的有前景方向

Abstract: Introduction. Dermoscopy aids melanoma triage, yet image-only AI often
ignores patient metadata (age, sex, site) and the physical scale needed for
geometric analysis. We present GraphDerm, a population-graph framework that
fuses imaging, millimeter-scale calibration, and metadata for multiclass
dermoscopic classification, to the best of our knowledge the first ISIC-scale
application of GNNs to dermoscopy. Methods. We curate ISIC 2018/2019,
synthesize ruler-embedded images with exact masks, and train U-Nets
(SE-ResNet-18) for lesion and ruler segmentation. Pixels-per-millimeter are
regressed from the ruler-mask two-point correlation via a lightweight 1D-CNN.
From lesion masks we compute real-scale descriptors (area, perimeter, radius of
gyration). Node features use EfficientNet-B3; edges encode metadata/geometry
similarity (fully weighted or thresholded). A spectral GNN performs
semi-supervised node classification; an image-only ANN is the baseline.
Results. Ruler and lesion segmentation reach Dice 0.904 and 0.908; scale
regression attains MAE 1.5 px (RMSE 6.6). The graph attains AUC 0.9812, with a
thresholded variant using about 25% of edges preserving AUC 0.9788 (vs. 0.9440
for the image-only baseline); per-class AUCs typically fall in the 0.97-0.99
range. Conclusion. Unifying calibrated scale, lesion geometry, and metadata in
a population graph yields substantial gains over image-only pipelines on
ISIC-2019. Sparser graphs retain near-optimal accuracy, suggesting efficient
deployment. Scale-aware, graph-based AI is a promising direction for
dermoscopic decision support; future work will refine learned edge semantics
and evaluate on broader curated benchmarks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出位置感知文本图像机器翻译(PATIMT)新任务，构建PATIMTBench基准数据集，通过自适应OCR优化流程提升文本识别精度，在紧凑型大视觉语言模型上实现最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统TIMT方法主要关注图像中所有文本的翻译，但忽略了提供边界框位置信息和覆盖有限场景的问题。需要支持细粒度、保持布局的翻译任务，这在实践中具有重要价值但尚未充分探索。

Method: 提出PATIMT任务，包含区域特定翻译和带定位的全图像翻译两个子任务。构建PATIMTBench基准数据集，采用自适应图像OCR优化流程，根据场景选择合适OCR工具并优化文本丰富图像的识别结果。构建包含1200个高质量实例的人工标注测试集。

Result: 在构建的数据集上进行微调后，紧凑型大视觉语言模型在两个子任务上都达到了最先进的性能。实验结果证明了训练数据的可扩展性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: PATIMT任务具有重要实用价值，提出的方法和基准数据集为位置感知文本图像翻译提供了有效的解决方案，紧凑模型在该任务上表现出色，展示了良好的应用前景。

Abstract: Text Image Machine Translation (TIMT) aims to translate texts embedded within
an image into another language. Current TIMT studies primarily focus on
providing translations for all the text within an image, while neglecting to
provide bounding boxes and covering limited scenarios. In this work, we extend
traditional TIMT into position-aware TIMT (PATIMT), aiming to support
fine-grained and layoutpreserving translation, which holds great practical
value but remains largely unexplored. This task comprises two key sub-tasks:
regionspecific translation and full-image translation with grounding. To
support existing models on PATIMT and conduct fair evaluation, we construct the
PATIMT benchmark (PATIMTBench), which consists of 10 diverse real-world
scenarios. Specifically, we introduce an Adaptive Image OCR Refinement
Pipeline, which adaptively selects appropriate OCR tools based on scenario and
refines the results of text-rich images. To ensure evaluation reliability, we
further construct a test set, which contains 1,200 high-quality instances
manually annotated and reviewed by human experts. After fine-tuning on our
data, compact Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) achieve state-of-the-art
performance on both sub-tasks. Experimental results also highlight the
scalability and generalizability of our training data

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出SimMemDA框架解决SAR与光学图像间的跨模态域适应问题，通过相似性引导和记忆引导机制提升无监督域自适应船舶尾迹检测性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SAR图像尾迹特征抽象且噪声多，标注困难；光学图像视觉线索清晰但存在域偏移问题，需要解决跨模态域适应挑战

Method: 使用WakeGAN进行风格迁移生成伪SAR图像，设计实例级特征相似性过滤机制筛选目标样分布样本，引入特征-置信度记忆库和K近邻置信加权融合策略动态校准目标域伪标签，通过区域混合训练增强泛化

Result: 实验结果表明SimMemDA方法能提高跨模态船舶尾迹检测任务的准确性和鲁棒性

Conclusion: 所提方法有效可行，验证了相似性引导和记忆引导机制在跨模态域适应中的有效性

Abstract: Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR), with its all-weather and wide-area
observation capabilities, serves as a crucial tool for wake detection. However,
due to its complex imaging mechanism, wake features in SAR images often appear
abstract and noisy, posing challenges for accurate annotation. In contrast,
optical images provide more distinct visual cues, but models trained on optical
data suffer from performance degradation when applied to SAR images due to
domain shift. To address this cross-modal domain adaptation challenge, we
propose a Similarity-Guided and Memory-Guided Domain Adaptation (termed
SimMemDA) framework for unsupervised domain adaptive ship wake detection via
instance-level feature similarity filtering and feature memory guidance.
Specifically, to alleviate the visual discrepancy between optical and SAR
images, we first utilize WakeGAN to perform style transfer on optical images,
generating pseudo-images close to the SAR style. Then, instance-level feature
similarity filtering mechanism is designed to identify and prioritize source
samples with target-like distributions, minimizing negative transfer.
Meanwhile, a Feature-Confidence Memory Bank combined with a K-nearest neighbor
confidence-weighted fusion strategy is introduced to dynamically calibrate
pseudo-labels in the target domain, improving the reliability and stability of
pseudo-labels. Finally, the framework further enhances generalization through
region-mixed training, strategically combining source annotations with
calibrated target pseudo-labels. Experimental results demonstrate that the
proposed SimMemDA method can improve the accuracy and robustness of cross-modal
ship wake detection tasks, validating the effectiveness and feasibility of the
proposed method.

TL;DR: 提出ResidualViT架构，通过可学习残差连接和token缩减模块，在保持精度的同时显著降低视频时序密集任务的计算成本


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频理解任务需要高时间分辨率采样，但计算帧级特征的计算成本很高，需要减少时序密集任务的特征计算成本

Method: 引入ResidualViT架构，包含可学习残差连接确保时序一致性，以及token缩减模块选择性丢弃冗余信息；提出轻量级蒸馏策略近似原始基础模型的帧级特征

Result: 在4个任务5个数据集上验证，计算成本降低60%，推理速度提升2.5倍，同时保持接近原始基础模型的精度

Conclusion: ResidualViT能有效处理视频时序密集任务，大幅降低计算成本并保持性能，适用于零样本和全监督设置

Abstract: Several video understanding tasks, such as natural language temporal video
grounding, temporal activity localization, and audio description generation,
require "temporally dense" reasoning over frames sampled at high temporal
resolution. However, computing frame-level features for these tasks is
computationally expensive given the temporal resolution requirements. In this
paper, we make three contributions to reduce the cost of computing features for
temporally dense tasks. First, we introduce a vision transformer (ViT)
architecture, dubbed ResidualViT, that leverages the large temporal redundancy
in videos to efficiently compute temporally dense frame-level features. Our
architecture incorporates (i) learnable residual connections that ensure
temporal consistency across consecutive frames and (ii) a token reduction
module that enhances processing speed by selectively discarding temporally
redundant information while reusing weights of a pretrained foundation model.
Second, we propose a lightweight distillation strategy to approximate the
frame-level features of the original foundation model. Finally, we evaluate our
approach across four tasks and five datasets, in both zero-shot and fully
supervised settings, demonstrating significant reductions in computational cost
(up to 60%) and improvements in inference speed (up to 2.5x faster), all while
closely approximating the accuracy of the original foundation model.

### [12] [Uncertainty-Aware Hourly Air Temperature Mapping at 2 km Resolution via Physics-Guided Deep Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12329)
*Shengjie Kris Liu,Siqin Wang,Lu Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Amplifier Air-Transformer方法，通过数据驱动和物理引导的深度学习，生成美国本土2公里分辨率的小时级气温数据，填补了气象站和卫星数据之间的时空空白。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 近地表气温是地球表面的关键物理属性，但现有气象站和卫星数据无法提供无缝的时空连续数据，需要一种能够结合两者优势的方法。

Method: 使用神经网络重建被云层遮挡的GOES-16地表温度数据，编码年温度周期，通过线性项放大ERA5温度值，卷积层捕捉时空变化，再通过另一个神经网络将重建的地表温度转换为气温。

Result: 基于77.7亿个地表温度像素和1.55亿个气象站气温记录（2018-2024年），在站点验证中达到1.93°C的小时气温映射精度。

Conclusion: 该方法简化了地表温度重建和气温预测流程，可扩展到其他卫星数据源，实现高时空分辨率的气温无缝监测。

Abstract: Near-surface air temperature is a key physical property of the Earth's
surface. Although weather stations offer continuous monitoring and satellites
provide broad spatial coverage, no single data source offers seamless data in a
spatiotemporal fashion. Here, we propose a data-driven, physics-guided deep
learning approach to generate hourly air temperature data at 2 km resolution
over the contiguous United States. The approach, called Amplifier
Air-Transformer, first reconstructs GOES-16 surface temperature data obscured
by clouds. It does so through a neural network encoded with the annual
temperature cycle, incorporating a linear term to amplify ERA5 temperature
values at finer scales and convolutional layers to capture spatiotemporal
variations. Then, another neural network transforms the reconstructed surface
temperature into air temperature by leveraging its latent relationship with key
Earth surface properties. The approach is further enhanced with predictive
uncertainty estimation through deep ensemble learning to improve reliability.
The proposed approach is built and tested on 77.7 billion surface temperature
pixels and 155 million air temperature records from weather stations across the
contiguous United States (2018-2024), achieving hourly air temperature mapping
accuracy of 1.93 C in station-based validation. The proposed approach
streamlines surface temperature reconstruction and air temperature prediction,
and it can be extended to other satellite sources for seamless air temperature
monitoring at high spatiotemporal resolution. The generated data of this study
can be downloaded at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15252812, and the project

Abstract: This paper details the DS@GT team's entry for the AnimalCLEF 2025
re-identification challenge. Our key finding is that the effectiveness of
post-hoc metric learning is highly contingent on the initial quality and
domain-specificity of the backbone embeddings. We compare a general-purpose
model (DINOv2) with a domain-specific model (MegaDescriptor) as a backbone. A
K-Nearest Neighbor classifier with robust thresholding then identifies known
individuals or flags new ones. While a triplet-learning projection head
improved the performance of the specialized MegaDescriptor model by 0.13
points, it yielded minimal gains (0.03) for the general-purpose DINOv2 on
averaged BAKS and BAUS. We demonstrate that the general-purpose manifold is
more difficult to reshape for fine-grained tasks, as evidenced by stagnant
validation loss and qualitative visualizations. This work highlights the
critical limitations of refining general-purpose features for specialized,
limited-data re-ID tasks and underscores the importance of domain-specific
pre-training. The implementation for this work is publicly available at
github.com/dsgt-arc/animalclef-2025.

TL;DR: 本文提出了GhostNetV3-Small架构，针对低分辨率图像分类任务进行优化，在CIFAR-10上达到93.94%准确率，发现架构调整比知识蒸馏更有效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络在资源受限的边缘设备上部署困难，需要探索模型压缩和适应策略来支持高效推理。

Method: 基于GhostNetV3架构开发GhostNetV3-Small变体，专门针对低分辨率输入优化，并比较了传统知识蒸馏、教师助理和教师集成等多种蒸馏技术。

Result: GhostNetV3-Small在CIFAR-10上显著优于原版GhostNetV3，达到93.94%准确率。所有蒸馏策略反而降低了准确率，表明架构调整比蒸馏更有效。

Conclusion: 在小规模图像分类任务中，架构适应比知识蒸馏更具影响力，需要进一步研究有效的模型设计和针对低分辨率领域的先进蒸馏技术。

Abstract: Deep neural networks have achieved remarkable success across a range of
tasks, however their computational demands often make them unsuitable for
deployment on resource-constrained edge devices. This paper explores strategies
for compressing and adapting models to enable efficient inference in such
environments. We focus on GhostNetV3, a state-of-the-art architecture for
mobile applications, and propose GhostNetV3-Small, a modified variant designed
to perform better on low-resolution inputs such as those in the CIFAR-10
dataset. In addition to architectural adaptation, we provide a comparative
evaluation of knowledge distillation techniques, including traditional
knowledge distillation, teacher assistants, and teacher ensembles. Experimental
results show that GhostNetV3-Small significantly outperforms the original
GhostNetV3 on CIFAR-10, achieving an accuracy of 93.94%. Contrary to
expectations, all examined distillation strategies led to reduced accuracy
compared to baseline training. These findings indicate that architectural
adaptation can be more impactful than distillation in small-scale image
classification tasks, highlighting the need for further research on effective
model design and advanced distillation techniques for low-resolution domains.

Abstract: Accurate mapping of individual trees is essential for ecological monitoring
and forest management. Orthomosaic imagery from unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)
is widely used, but stitching artifacts and heavy preprocessing limit its
suitability for field deployment. This study explores the use of raw UAV
imagery for palm detection and crown-center localization in tropical forests.
Two research questions are addressed: (1) how detection performance varies
across orthomosaic and raw imagery, including within-domain and cross-domain
transfer, and (2) to what extent crown-center annotations improve localization
accuracy beyond bounding-box centroids. Using state-of-the-art detectors and
keypoint models, we show that raw imagery yields superior performance in
deployment-relevant scenarios, while orthomosaics retain value for robust
cross-domain generalization. Incorporating crown-center annotations in training
further improves localization and provides precise tree positions for
downstream ecological analyses. These findings offer practical guidance for
UAV-based biodiversity and conservation monitoring.

TL;DR: 提出了MechBench基准数据集和DYNAMO神经网络模型，用于从CAD点云预测齿轮组件的运动轨迹，解决了机械装配体中基于几何耦合的运动推理问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要处理简单铰接物体（如门、笔记本电脑），假设简化的运动学结构或依赖关节标注。但对于齿轮等机械装配体，运动来源于几何耦合（如啮合齿或对齐轴），难以仅从几何形状推理关系运动。

Method: 1) 创建MechBench数据集：包含693个合成齿轮装配体，提供零件级真实运动轨迹；2) 提出DYNAMO模型：依赖感知的神经网络，直接从分割的CAD点云预测每个零件的SE(3)运动轨迹。

Result: 实验表明DYNAMO优于强基线方法，在不同齿轮配置下实现了准确且时间一致的运动预测。

Conclusion: MechBench和DYNAMO共同建立了数据驱动学习CAD装配体中耦合机械运动的新系统框架，为3D感知和设计自动化提供了重要工具。

Abstract: Understanding the motion of articulated mechanical assemblies from static
geometry remains a core challenge in 3D perception and design automation. Prior
work on everyday articulated objects such as doors and laptops typically
assumes simplified kinematic structures or relies on joint annotations.
However, in mechanical assemblies like gears, motion arises from geometric
coupling, through meshing teeth or aligned axes, making it difficult for
existing methods to reason about relational motion from geometry alone. To
address this gap, we introduce MechBench, a benchmark dataset of 693 diverse
synthetic gear assemblies with part-wise ground-truth motion trajectories.
MechBench provides a structured setting to study coupled motion, where part
dynamics are induced by contact and transmission rather than predefined joints.
Building on this, we propose DYNAMO, a dependency-aware neural model that
predicts per-part SE(3) motion trajectories directly from segmented CAD point
clouds. Experiments show that DYNAMO outperforms strong baselines, achieving
accurate and temporally consistent predictions across varied gear
configurations. Together, MechBench and DYNAMO establish a novel systematic
framework for data-driven learning of coupled mechanical motion in CAD
assemblies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 棉花作为重要天然纤维作物，收获仍依赖人工采摘，效率低且易错过最佳收获期。准确识别棉花铃花及其成熟度对自动化收获、产量估算和育种研究至关重要。

Method: 基于YOLOv11n构建轻量级实时检测器Cott-ADNet，改进卷积设计增强空间表征和鲁棒性，引入NeLU增强全局注意力机制捕捉弱特征和低对比度特征，采用扩张感受野SPPF模块以低计算成本扩展感受野进行多尺度上下文建模。

Conclusion: Cott-ADNet为田间部署提供了准确高效的解决方案，为自动化棉花采摘和高通量表型分析奠定了可靠基础，代码和数据集已开源。

Abstract: Cotton is one of the most important natural fiber crops worldwide, yet
harvesting remains limited by labor-intensive manual picking, low efficiency,
and yield losses from missing the optimal harvest window. Accurate recognition
of cotton bolls and their maturity is therefore essential for automation, yield
estimation, and breeding research. We propose Cott-ADNet, a lightweight
real-time detector tailored to cotton boll and flower recognition under complex
field conditions. Building on YOLOv11n, Cott-ADNet enhances spatial
representation and robustness through improved convolutional designs, while
introducing two new modules: a NeLU-enhanced Global Attention Mechanism to
better capture weak and low-contrast features, and a Dilated Receptive Field
SPPF to expand receptive fields for more effective multi-scale context modeling
at low computational cost. We curate a labeled dataset of 4,966 images, and
release an external validation set of 1,216 field images to support future
research. Experiments show that Cott-ADNet achieves 91.5% Precision, 89.8%
Recall, 93.3% mAP50, 71.3% mAP, and 90.6% F1-Score with only 7.5 GFLOPs,
maintaining stable performance under multi-scale and rotational variations.
These results demonstrate Cott-ADNet as an accurate and efficient solution for
in-field deployment, and thus provide a reliable basis for automated cotton
harvesting and high-throughput phenotypic analysis. Code and dataset is

Abstract: Point cloud processing as a fundamental task in the field of geomatics and
computer vision, has been supporting tasks and applications at different scales
from air to ground, including mapping, environmental monitoring, urban/tree
structure modeling, automated driving, robotics, disaster responses etc. Due to
the rapid development of deep learning, point cloud processing algorithms have
nowadays been almost explicitly dominated by learning-based approaches, most of
which are yet transitioned into real-world practices. Existing surveys
primarily focus on the ever-updating network architecture to accommodate
unordered point clouds, largely ignoring their practical values in typical
point cloud processing applications, in which extra-large volume of data,
diverse scene contents, varying point density, data modality need to be
considered. In this paper, we provide a meta review on deep learning approaches
and datasets that cover a selection of critical tasks of point cloud processing
in use such as scene completion, registration, semantic segmentation, and
modeling. By reviewing a broad range of urban and environmental applications
these tasks can support, we identify gaps to be closed as these methods
transformed into applications and draw concluding remarks in both the
algorithmic and practical aspects of the surveyed methods.

Motivation: 现有青光眼预后方法依赖固定长度历史序列数据，灵活性受限；端到端模型在有限数据集上表现不佳，需要解决多数据集整合和变长输入处理问题

Method: 两阶段框架：第一阶段使用自监督学习整合多个青光眼数据集进行特征表示学习；第二阶段引入基于注意力的时序聚合模块处理变长序列输入

Result: 在两个不同规模和临床设置的基准数据集(OHTS和GRAPE)上进行了广泛实验，证明了方法的有效性和鲁棒性

Conclusion: TSDF框架能够灵活处理变长序列输入，在保持参数紧凑的同时显著提升模型性能，为青光眼预后提供了有效的解决方案

Abstract: Glaucoma is one of the leading causes of irreversible blindness worldwide.
Glaucoma prognosis is essential for identifying at-risk patients and enabling
timely intervention to prevent blindness. Many existing approaches rely on
historical sequential data but are constrained by fixed-length inputs, limiting
their flexibility. Additionally, traditional glaucoma prognosis methods often
employ end-to-end models, which struggle with the limited size of glaucoma
datasets. To address these challenges, we propose a Two-Stage Decoupling
Framework (TSDF) for variable-length glaucoma prognosis. In the first stage, we
employ a feature representation module that leverages self-supervised learning
to aggregate multiple glaucoma datasets for training, disregarding differences
in their supervisory information. This approach enables datasets of varying
sizes to learn better feature representations. In the second stage, we
introduce a temporal aggregation module that incorporates an attention-based
mechanism to process sequential inputs of varying lengths, ensuring flexible
and efficient utilization of all available data. This design significantly
enhances model performance while maintaining a compact parameter size.
Extensive experiments on two benchmark glaucoma datasets:the Ocular
Hypertension Treatment Study (OHTS) and the Glaucoma Real-world Appraisal
Progression Ensemble (GRAPE),which differ significantly in scale and clinical
settings,demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our approach.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的tokenizer训练方案，包括主训练和后训练，通过模拟生成过程中的采样噪声和优化解码器，显著提升了生成质量和收敛速度。


<details>

Motivation: 现有的图像生成模型在重建分布和生成分布之间存在显著差异，当前tokenizer只关注重建任务而不考虑生成过程中的错误。

Method: 提出主训练阶段的潜在扰动策略模拟采样噪声，以及后训练阶段针对训练好的生成模型优化tokenizer解码器。还提出了新的评估指标pFID。

Result: 使用约4亿参数的生成器，经过主训练的tokenizer达到1.60 gFID，后训练后进一步提升到1.36 gFID。方法在离散和连续tokenizer以及不同生成模型上都有效。

Conclusion: 该方法通过同时考虑重建和生成任务，有效缩小了重建与生成分布之间的差距，显著提升了图像生成质量。

Abstract: Recent image generative models typically capture the image distribution in a
pre-constructed latent space, relying on a frozen image tokenizer. However,
there exists a significant discrepancy between the reconstruction and
generation distribution, where current tokenizers only prioritize the
reconstruction task that happens before generative training without considering
the generation errors during sampling. In this paper, we comprehensively
analyze the reason for this discrepancy in a discrete latent space, and, from
which, we propose a novel tokenizer training scheme including both
main-training and post-training, focusing on improving latent space
construction and decoding respectively. During the main training, a latent
perturbation strategy is proposed to simulate sampling noises, \ie, the
unexpected tokens generated in generative inference. Specifically, we propose a
plug-and-play tokenizer training scheme, which significantly enhances the
robustness of tokenizer, thus boosting the generation quality and convergence
speed, and a novel tokenizer evaluation metric, \ie, pFID, which successfully
correlates the tokenizer performance to generation quality. During
post-training, we further optimize the tokenizer decoder regarding a
well-trained generative model to mitigate the distribution difference between
generated and reconstructed tokens. With a $\sim$400M generator, a discrete
tokenizer trained with our proposed main training achieves a notable 1.60 gFID
and further obtains 1.36 gFID with the additional post-training. Further
experiments are conducted to broadly validate the effectiveness of our
post-training strategy on off-the-shelf discrete and continuous tokenizers,
coupled with autoregressive and diffusion-based generators.

TL;DR: 提出了一个基于100万样本的大规模毫米波雷达数据集和通用雷达变换器（GRT）基础模型，能够实现高质量的3D占用和语义分割，性能接近高分辨率传感器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 毫米波雷达虽然成本低、耐用且对遮挡和环境条件鲁棒，但角分辨率较差。现有方法缺乏标准化基础模型和大数据集，通常需要从头训练任务特定模型。

Method: 收集了100万样本（29小时）的最大原始雷达数据集，训练了4D单芯片雷达基础模型GRT，使用原始雷达数据而非有损表示，并进行广泛消融实验。

Result: GRT能够泛化到不同场景，可微调用于不同任务，数据缩放呈对数增长（每10倍数据提升20%），使用原始数据相当于10倍训练数据增益。

Conclusion: 估计需要约1亿样本（3000小时）数据才能充分发挥GRT潜力，为毫米波雷达领域提供了首个大规模基础模型解决方案。

Abstract: mmWave radars are compact, inexpensive, and durable sensors that are robust
to occlusions and work regardless of environmental conditions, such as weather
and darkness. However, this comes at the cost of poor angular resolution,
especially for inexpensive single-chip radars, which are typically used in
automotive and indoor sensing applications. Although many have proposed
learning-based methods to mitigate this weakness, no standardized foundational
models or large datasets for the mmWave radar have emerged, and practitioners
have largely trained task-specific models from scratch using relatively small
datasets.
  In this paper, we collect (to our knowledge) the largest available raw radar
dataset with 1M samples (29 hours) and train a foundational model for 4D
single-chip radar, which can predict 3D occupancy and semantic segmentation
with quality that is typically only possible with much higher resolution
sensors. We demonstrate that our Generalizable Radar Transformer (GRT)
generalizes across diverse settings, can be fine-tuned for different tasks, and
shows logarithmic data scaling of 20\% per $10\times$ data. We also run
extensive ablations on common design decisions, and find that using raw radar
data significantly outperforms widely-used lossy representations, equivalent to
a $10\times$ increase in training data. Finally, we roughly estimate that
$\approx$100M samples (3000 hours) of data are required to fully exploit the
potential of GRT.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然视觉语言模型在多模态任务中表现出色，但其在噪声条件下的鲁棒性尚未得到充分研究，需要建立标准化评估框架

Method: 使用控制性扰动（光照变化、运动模糊、压缩伪影）评估多个SOTA VLMs，结合词汇指标（BLEU等）和神经相似性度量来量化语义对齐

Result: 实验发现：1）标注质量显著影响性能；2）大模型在语义理解上表现优异但不总是优于小模型；3）JPEG压缩和运动模糊等噪声会大幅降低所有模型性能

Conclusion: 研究揭示了模型大小、数据集特性和噪声鲁棒性之间的微妙权衡，为未来鲁棒多模态学习提供了标准化基准

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have attained exceptional success across
multimodal tasks such as image captioning and visual question answering.
However, their robustness under noisy conditions remains unfamiliar. In this
study, we present a comprehensive evaluation framework to evaluate the
performance of several state-of-the-art VLMs under controlled perturbations,
including lighting variation, motion blur, and compression artifacts. We used
both lexical-based metrics (BLEU, METEOR, ROUGE, CIDEr) and neural-based
similarity measures using sentence embeddings to quantify semantic alignment.
Our experiments span diverse datasets, revealing key insights: (1)
descriptiveness of ground-truth captions significantly influences model
performance; (2) larger models like LLaVA excel in semantic understanding but
do not universally outperform smaller models; and (3) certain noise types, such
as JPEG compression and motion blur, dramatically degrade performance across
models. Our findings highlight the nuanced trade-offs between model size,
dataset characteristics, and noise resilience, offering a standardized
benchmark for future robust multimodal learning.

Motivation: 解决现有弱监督语义分割方法在目标边界定位不精确和仅关注最具判别性区域的问题，避免昂贵的像素级标注需求

Method: 提出IG-CAM方法，包含三个关键创新：实例引导细化、影响函数集成和多尺度边界增强，利用实例级线索和影响函数生成高质量边界感知定位图

Result: 在PASCAL VOC 2012数据集上达到82.3% mIoU（后处理前），经过CRF细化后提升至86.6%，显著超越先前WSSS方法，展示了卓越的定位精度和完整目标覆盖

Conclusion: IG-CAM为弱监督语义分割设立了新的基准，为像素级标注不可用或成本过高的情况提供了实用解决方案，具有优秀的鲁棒性和泛化能力

Abstract: Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation (WSSS) addresses the challenge of
training segmentation models using only image-level annotations, eliminating
the need for expensive pixel-level labeling. While existing methods struggle
with precise object boundary localization and often focus only on the most
discriminative regions, we propose IG-CAM (Instance-Guided Class Activation
Mapping), a novel approach that leverages instance-level cues and influence
functions to generate high-quality, boundary-aware localization maps. Our
method introduces three key innovations: (1) Instance-Guided Refinement that
uses ground truth segmentation masks to guide CAM generation, ensuring complete
object coverage rather than just discriminative parts; (2) Influence Function
Integration that captures the relationship between training samples and model
predictions, leading to more robust feature representations; and (3)
Multi-Scale Boundary Enhancement that employs progressive refinement strategies
to achieve sharp, precise object boundaries. IG-CAM achieves state-of-the-art
performance on the PASCAL VOC 2012 dataset with an mIoU of 82.3% before
post-processing, which further improves to 86.6% after applying Conditional
Random Field (CRF) refinement, significantly outperforming previous WSSS
methods. Our approach demonstrates superior localization accuracy, with
complete object coverage and precise boundary delineation, while maintaining
computational efficiency. Extensive ablation studies validate the contribution
of each component, and qualitative comparisons across 600 diverse images
showcase the method's robustness and generalization capability. The results
establish IG-CAM as a new benchmark for weakly supervised semantic
segmentation, offering a practical solution for scenarios where pixel-level
annotations are unavailable or prohibitively expensive.

Abstract: We present an end-to-end framework for generating artist-style meshes from
noisy or incomplete point clouds, such as those captured by real-world sensors
like LiDAR or mobile RGB-D cameras. Artist-created meshes are crucial for
commercial graphics pipelines due to their compatibility with animation and
texturing tools and their efficiency in rendering. However, existing approaches
often assume clean, complete inputs or rely on complex multi-stage pipelines,
limiting their applicability in real-world scenarios. To address this, we
propose an end-to-end method that refines the input point cloud and directly
produces high-quality, artist-style meshes. At the core of our approach is a
novel reformulation of 3D point cloud refinement as a 2D inpainting task,
enabling the use of powerful generative models. Preliminary results on the
ShapeNet dataset demonstrate the promise of our framework in producing clean,
complete meshes.

Abstract: Accurate, high-throughput phenotyping is a critical component of modern crop

Analysis (PCA) to perform robust diameter estimation. By mitigating the effects
of curvature, occlusion, and image noise, this approach offers a scalable and
reliable solution to support high-throughput phenotyping in breeding and

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across
distributed clients while preserving data privacy. However, the performance of
deep learning often deteriorates in FL due to decentralized and heterogeneous
data. This challenge is further amplified in multi-label scenarios, where data
exhibit complex characteristics such as label co-occurrence, inter-label
dependency, and discrepancies between local and global label relationships.
While most existing FL research primarily focuses on single-label
classification, many real-world applications, particularly in domains such as
medical imaging, often involve multi-label settings. In this paper, we address
this important yet underexplored scenario in FL, where clients hold multi-label
data with skewed label distributions. Neural Collapse (NC) describes a
geometric structure in the latent feature space where features of each class
collapse to their class mean with vanishing intra-class variance, and the class
means form a maximally separated configuration. Motivated by this theory, we
propose a method to align feature distributions across clients and to learn
high-quality, well-clustered representations. To make the NC-structure
applicable to multi-label settings, where image-level features may contain
multiple semantic concepts, we introduce a feature disentanglement module that
extracts semantically specific features. The clustering of these disentangled
class-wise features is guided by a predefined shared NC structure, which
mitigates potential conflicts between client models due to diverse local data
distributions. In addition, we design regularisation losses to encourage
compact clustering in the latent feature space. Experiments conducted on four
benchmark datasets across eight diverse settings demonstrate that our approach
outperforms existing methods, validating its effectiveness in this challenging
FL scenario.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决人脸伪造检测中离线基准与真实世界效果之间的差距问题，主要原因是训练数据的生态无效性，无法捕捉人类伪造的多样意图和迭代过程以及社交媒体中复杂的文本-图像对抗交互

Method: 提出多智能体框架，配备配置文件和记忆模块的LLM智能体模拟伪造创建过程，在模拟社交环境中交互生成样本，使用自适应拒绝采样(ARS)机制确保数据质量和多样性

Result: 大量实验验证，通过模拟驱动方法生成的数据为多种架构的检测器带来显著性能提升

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了人脸伪造检测中的生态无效性问题，生成的训练数据能够显著提升检测器在真实场景中的性能表现

Abstract: Face forgery detection faces a critical challenge: a persistent gap between
offline benchmarks and real-world efficacy,which we attribute to the ecological
invalidity of training data.This work introduces Agent4FaceForgery to address
two fundamental problems: (1) how to capture the diverse intents and iterative
processes of human forgery creation, and (2) how to model the complex, often
adversarial, text-image interactions that accompany forgeries in social media.
To solve this,we propose a multi-agent framework where LLM-poweredagents,
equipped with profile and memory modules, simulate the forgery creation
process. Crucially, these agents interact in a simulated social environment to
generate samples labeled for nuanced text-image consistency, moving beyond
simple binary classification. An Adaptive Rejection Sampling (ARS) mechanism
ensures data quality and diversity. Extensive experiments validate that the
data generated by our simulationdriven approach brings significant performance
gains to detectors of multiple architectures, fully demonstrating the
effectiveness and value of our framework.

TL;DR: 提出了MGNM多模态图网络模型，利用GNN显式建模人-物交互关系，在HOI检测任务上达到state-of-the-art性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer架构在HOI检测中无法显式建模关系结构，而GNN天生更适合建模人-物对之间的关系

Method: 设计四阶段图结构的多模态图网络框架，引入多级特征交互机制，利用多级视觉和语言特征增强人-物对间的信息传播

Result: 在HICO-DET和V-COCO基准测试中达到最佳性能，与更先进的目标检测器结合时性能显著提升，在稀有和非稀有类别间保持有效平衡

Conclusion: GNN-based的关系结构建模能有效提升HOI检测性能，多模态图网络框架是解决该任务的有效方法

Abstract: Transformer-based methods have recently become the prevailing approach for
Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection. However, the Transformer architecture
does not explicitly model the relational structures inherent in HOI detection,
which impedes the recognition of interactions. In contrast, Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs) are inherently better suited for this task, as they explicitly
model the relationships between human-object pairs. Therefore, in this paper,
we propose \textbf{M}ultimodal \textbf{G}raph \textbf{N}etwork
\textbf{M}odeling (MGNM) that leverages GNN-based relational structures to
enhance HOI detection. Specifically, we design a multimodal graph network
framework that explicitly models the HOI task in a four-stage graph structure.
Furthermore, we introduce a multi-level feature interaction mechanism within
our graph network. This mechanism leverages multi-level vision and language
features to enhance information propagation across human-object pairs.
Consequently, our proposed MGNM achieves state-of-the-art performance on two
widely used benchmarks: HICO-DET and V-COCO. Moreover, when integrated with a
more advanced object detector, our method demonstrates a significant
performance gain and maintains an effective balance between rare and non-rare
classes.

Motivation: 现有光照估计方法要么难以恢复光照图的细节纹理，要么在运行速度和纹理保真度方面面临挑战，需要一种既能保持高保真度又能快速推理的解决方案。

Method: 提出VQT-Light框架，包含特征提取和光照估计两个模块：1）使用VQVAE提取光照图的离散特征以避免"后验坍塌"；2）使用ViT而非CNN捕获输入图像的全局上下文和依赖关系，将光照估计建模为多分类任务。

Result: 模型实现了40FPS的推理速度，在多个评估指标上均有提升，能够预测具有更丰富纹理和更好保真度的光照图。

Conclusion: 定性和定量实验表明，该方法相比现有最先进方法实现了更优越的结果，在保持轻量级和快速的同时提升了光照估计的质量。

Abstract: Accurate lighting estimation is a significant yet challenging task in
computer vision and graphics. However, existing methods either struggle to
restore detailed textures of illumination map, or face challenges in running
speed and texture fidelity. To tackle this problem, we propose a novel
framework (VQT-Light) based on VQVAE and ViT architecture. VQT-Light includes
two modules: feature extraction and lighting estimation. First, we take
advantages of VQVAE to extract discrete features of illumination map rather
than continuous features to avoid "posterior collapse". Second, we capture
global context and dependencies of input image through ViT rather than CNNs to
improve the prediction of illumination outside the field of view. Combining the
above two modules, we formulate the lighting estimation as a multiclass
classification task, which plays a key role in our pipeline. As a result, our
model predicts light map with richer texture and better fidelity while keeping
lightweight and fast. VQT-Light achieves an inference speed of 40FPS and
improves multiple evaluation metrics. Qualitative and quantitative experiments
demonstrate that the proposed method realizes superior results compared to
existing state-of-the-art methods.

Motivation: 现有的蒸馏方法在目标时间步选择上主要依赖确定性或随机策略，需要为不同蒸馏过程专门设计采样调度器，限制了扩散模型在实际应用中的采样灵活性。

Method: 提出自适应采样调度器，包含三个创新策略：(1)动态目标时间步选择，基于计算的重要性自适应选择时间步；(2)优化交替采样，基于时间步重要性引导前向去噪和后向加噪；(3)使用平滑裁剪和颜色平衡技术实现稳定高质量生成。

Conclusion: 该方法实现了强大的适应性，显著提高了扩散模型的生成性能，扩展了一致性蒸馏模型在复杂生成场景中的适用性。

Abstract: Consistent distillation methods have evolved into effective techniques that
significantly accelerate the sampling process of diffusion models. Although
existing methods have achieved remarkable results, the selection of target
timesteps during distillation mainly relies on deterministic or stochastic
strategies, which often require sampling schedulers to be designed specifically
for different distillation processes. Moreover, this pattern severely limits
flexibility, thereby restricting the full sampling potential of diffusion
models in practical applications. To overcome these limitations, this paper
proposes an adaptive sampling scheduler that is applicable to various
consistency distillation frameworks. The scheduler introduces three innovative
strategies: (i) dynamic target timestep selection, which adapts to different
consistency distillation frameworks by selecting timesteps based on their
computed importance; (ii) Optimized alternating sampling along the solution
trajectory by guiding forward denoising and backward noise addition based on
the proposed time step importance, enabling more effective exploration of the
solution space to enhance generation performance; and (iii) Utilization of
smoothing clipping and color balancing techniques to achieve stable and
high-quality generation results at high guidance scales, thereby expanding the
applicability of consistency distillation models in complex generation
scenarios. We validated the effectiveness and flexibility of the adaptive
sampling scheduler across various consistency distillation methods through
comprehensive experimental evaluations. Experimental results consistently
demonstrated significant improvements in generative performance, highlighting
the strong adaptability achieved by our method.

Method: 逆向工程定位模型的特征提取网络，识别关键关键点，策略性移除包含Top-K关键点的区域，使用近红外吸收材料在物理世界隐藏关键区域

Result: 在KITTI数据集上测试三种先进点云配准模型(HRegNet、D3Feat、GeoTransformer)，移除关键区域显著降低配准精度；在Autoware平台上验证，隐藏少量关键区域即可引起明显定位漂移；物理世界攻击成功复现KITTI数据中的攻击效果

Conclusion: DisorientLiDAR框架验证了LiDAR定位系统对关键点移除攻击的脆弱性，物理世界攻击演示了该方法的真实性和通用性，为自动驾驶安全提供了重要警示

Abstract: Deep learning models have been shown to be susceptible to adversarial attacks
with visually imperceptible perturbations. Even this poses a serious security
challenge for the localization of self-driving cars, there has been very little
exploration of attack on it, as most of adversarial attacks have been applied
to 3D perception. In this work, we propose a novel adversarial attack framework
called DisorientLiDAR targeting LiDAR-based localization. By
reverse-engineering localization models (e.g., feature extraction networks),
adversaries can identify critical keypoints and strategically remove them,
thereby disrupting LiDAR-based localization. Our proposal is first evaluated on
three state-of-the-art point-cloud registration models (HRegNet, D3Feat, and
GeoTransformer) using the KITTI dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that
removing regions containing Top-K keypoints significantly degrades their
registration accuracy. We further validate the attack's impact on the Autoware
autonomous driving platform, where hiding merely a few critical regions induces
noticeable localization drift. Finally, we extended our attacks to the physical
world by hiding critical regions with near-infrared absorptive materials,
thereby successfully replicate the attack effects observed in KITTI data. This
step has been closer toward the realistic physical-world attack that
demonstrate the veracity and generality of our proposal.

Conclusion: 通过引入光谱学习视角和光谱码本技术，能够有效利用光谱信息区分反射，为反射消除问题提供了新的解决方案，在多个基准测试中取得了优异性能。

Abstract: Eliminating reflections caused by incident light interacting with reflective
medium remains an ill-posed problem in the image restoration area. The primary
challenge arises from the overlapping of reflection and transmission components
in the captured images, which complicates the task of accurately distinguishing
and recovering the clean background. Existing approaches typically address
reflection removal solely in the image domain, ignoring the spectral property
variations of reflected light, which hinders their ability to effectively
discern reflections. In this paper, we start with a new perspective on spectral
learning, and propose the Spectral Codebook to reconstruct the optical spectrum
of the reflection image. The reflections can be effectively distinguished by
perceiving the wavelength differences between different light sources in the
spectrum. To leverage the reconstructed spectrum, we design two spectral prior
refinement modules to re-distribute pixels in the spatial dimension and
adaptively enhance the spectral differences along the wavelength dimension.
Furthermore, we present the Spectrum-Aware Transformer to jointly recover the
transmitted content in spectral and pixel domains. Experimental results on
three different reflection benchmarks demonstrate the superiority and
generalization ability of our method compared to state-of-the-art models.

Abstract: Adversarial robustness distillation (ARD) aims to transfer both performance
and robustness from teacher model to lightweight student model, enabling
resilient performance on resource-constrained scenarios. Though existing ARD
approaches enhance student model's robustness, the inevitable by-product leads
to the degraded performance on clean examples. We summarize the causes of this
problem inherent in existing methods with dual-teacher framework as: 1. The
divergent optimization objectives of dual-teacher models, i.e., the clean and
robust teachers, impede effective knowledge transfer to the student model, and
2. The iteratively generated adversarial examples during training lead to
performance deterioration of the robust teacher model. To address these
challenges, we propose a novel Cyclic Iterative ARD (CIARD) method with two key
innovations: a. A multi-teacher framework with contrastive push-loss alignment
to resolve conflicts in dual-teacher optimization objectives, and b. Continuous
adversarial retraining to maintain dynamic teacher robustness against
performance degradation from the varying adversarial examples. Extensive
experiments on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and Tiny-ImageNet demonstrate that CIARD
achieves remarkable performance with an average 3.53 improvement in adversarial
defense rates across various attack scenarios and a 5.87 increase in clean
sample accuracy, establishing a new benchmark for balancing model robustness
and generalization. Our code is available at https://github.com/eminentgu/CIARD

TL;DR: 本文提出了首个语义对齐的多模态操纵检测数据集SAMM和检索增强的检测框架RamDG，解决了现有基准中跨模态不对齐的问题，在检测准确率上比现有方法提升2.06%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有媒体取证基准存在跨模态不对齐的人工痕迹，无法反映真实世界中的语义一致性操纵模式，需要构建更符合实际攻击场景的数据集和检测方法。

Method: 采用两阶段流程构建SAMM数据集：先应用先进图像操纵技术，再生成语义一致的文本叙述；提出RamDG框架，利用外部知识检索上下文证据，通过图像伪造定位和深度操纵检测模块进行多模态分析。

Result: 在SAMM数据集上，RamDG框架比最先进方法检测准确率提升2.06%，显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 语义对齐的多模态操纵检测是媒体取证的重要方向，SAMM数据集和RamDG框架为解决真实世界中的多模态内容操纵提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: The detection and grounding of manipulated content in multimodal data has
emerged as a critical challenge in media forensics. While existing benchmarks
demonstrate technical progress, they suffer from misalignment artifacts that
poorly reflect real-world manipulation patterns: practical attacks typically
maintain semantic consistency across modalities, whereas current datasets
artificially disrupt cross-modal alignment, creating easily detectable
anomalies. To bridge this gap, we pioneer the detection of
semantically-coordinated manipulations where visual edits are systematically
paired with semantically consistent textual descriptions. Our approach begins
with constructing the first Semantic-Aligned Multimodal Manipulation (SAMM)
dataset, generated through a two-stage pipeline: 1) applying state-of-the-art
image manipulations, followed by 2) generation of contextually-plausible
textual narratives that reinforce the visual deception. Building on this
foundation, we propose a Retrieval-Augmented Manipulation Detection and
Grounding (RamDG) framework. RamDG commences by harnessing external knowledge
repositories to retrieve contextual evidence, which serves as the auxiliary
texts and encoded together with the inputs through our image forgery grounding
and deep manipulation detection modules to trace all manipulations. Extensive
experiments demonstrate our framework significantly outperforms existing
methods, achieving 2.06\% higher detection accuracy on SAMM compared to
state-of-the-art approaches. The dataset and code are publicly available at
https://github.com/shen8424/SAMM-RamDG-CAP.

Motivation: 现有方法在跨视角地理定位中往往忽略空间和语义信息，难以处理显著的外观变化和提取判别性特征，需要一种能够同时捕获多尺度频率特征并关注关键区域的方法。

Method: 提出MFAF方法，包含多频率分支块(MFB)捕获多尺度低频结构特征和高频边缘细节，以及频率感知空间注意力(FSA)模块自适应关注频率特征的关键区域。

Conclusion: MFAF方法通过多尺度频率特征提取和注意力机制，有效提升了跨视角地理定位的性能，解决了视角变化和背景噪声干扰的问题。

Abstract: Cross-view geo-localization aims to determine the geographical location of a
query image by matching it against a gallery of images. This task is
challenging due to the significant appearance variations of objects observed
from variable views, along with the difficulty in extracting discriminative
features. Existing approaches often rely on extracting features through feature
map segmentation while neglecting spatial and semantic information. To address
these issues, we propose the EVA02-based Multi-scale Frequency Attention Fusion
(MFAF) method. The MFAF method consists of Multi-Frequency Branch-wise Block
(MFB) and the Frequency-aware Spatial Attention (FSA) module. The MFB block
effectively captures both low-frequency structural features and high-frequency
edge details across multiple scales, improving the consistency and robustness
of feature representations across various viewpoints. Meanwhile, the FSA module
adaptively focuses on the key regions of frequency features, significantly
mitigating the interference caused by background noise and viewpoint
variability. Extensive experiments on widely recognized benchmarks, including
University-1652, SUES-200, and Dense-UAV, demonstrate that the MFAF method
achieves competitive performance in both drone localization and drone
navigation tasks.

TL;DR: 本文对YOLOv8-s、YOLOv9-s、YOLOv10-s和YOLOv11-s在海洋图像上的性能进行了首次系统比较，发现YOLOv9后精度趋于饱和，而YOLOv10在嵌入式AUV部署中提供了最佳的速度-精度权衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 水下自主航行器(AUVs)依赖计算机视觉系统进行海洋任务，但水下图像存在光线衰减、浑浊和类别不平衡等问题，且AUV计算资源有限。需要评估YOLO系列检测器在海洋领域的性能表现。

Method: 使用两个公开数据集（珊瑚疾病数据集和鱼类物种数据集），创建四种训练规模（25%、50%、75%、100%图像），在相同超参数下训练四个YOLO变体，评估精度、召回率、mAP、推理时间等指标，并进行Grad-CAM可视化分析。

Result: 在两个数据集上，YOLOv9之后精度趋于饱和，主要改进在于效率而非精度。推理速度显著提升，YOLOv10在速度和精度之间提供了最佳平衡。

Conclusion: YOLOv10是嵌入式AUV部署的最佳选择，研究提供了可复现的基准和代码库，加速未来海洋视觉研究发展。

Abstract: Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) increasingly rely on on-board
computer-vision systems for tasks such as habitat mapping, ecological
monitoring, and infrastructure inspection. However, underwater imagery is
hindered by light attenuation, turbidity, and severe class imbalance, while the
computational resources available on AUVs are limited. One-stage detectors from
the YOLO family are attractive because they fuse localization and
classification in a single, low-latency network; however, their terrestrial
benchmarks (COCO, PASCAL-VOC, Open Images) leave open the question of how
successive YOLO releases perform in the marine domain. We curate two openly
available datasets that span contrasting operating conditions: a Coral Disease
set (4,480 images, 18 classes) and a Fish Species set (7,500 images, 20
classes). For each dataset, we create four training regimes (25 %, 50 %, 75 %,
100 % of the images) while keeping balanced validation and test partitions
fixed. We train YOLOv8-s, YOLOv9-s, YOLOv10-s, and YOLOv11-s with identical
hyperparameters (100 epochs, 640 px input, batch = 16, T4 GPU) and evaluate
precision, recall, mAP50, mAP50-95, per-image inference time, and
frames-per-second (FPS). Post-hoc Grad-CAM visualizations probe feature
utilization and localization faithfulness. Across both datasets, accuracy
saturates after YOLOv9, suggesting architectural innovations primarily target
efficiency rather than accuracy. Inference speed, however, improves markedly.
Our results (i) provide the first controlled comparison of recent YOLO variants
on underwater imagery, (ii) show that lightweight YOLOv10 offers the best
speed-accuracy trade-off for embedded AUV deployment, and (iii) deliver an
open, reproducible benchmark and codebase to accelerate future marine-vision
research.

Abstract: Stereo matching plays a crucial role in enabling depth perception for
autonomous driving and robotics. While recent years have witnessed remarkable
progress in stereo matching algorithms, largely driven by learning-based
methods and synthetic datasets, the generalization performance of these models
remains constrained by the limited diversity of existing training data. To
address these challenges, we present StereoCarla, a high-fidelity synthetic

the CARLA simulator, StereoCarla incorporates a wide range of camera
configurations, including diverse baselines, viewpoints, and sensor placements
as well as varied environmental conditions such as lighting changes, weather
effects, and road geometries. We conduct comprehensive cross-domain experiments
across four standard evaluation datasets (KITTI2012, KITTI2015, Middlebury,
ETH3D) and demonstrate that models trained on StereoCarla outperform those
trained on 11 existing stereo datasets in terms of generalization accuracy
across multiple benchmarks. Furthermore, when integrated into multi-dataset
training, StereoCarla contributes substantial improvements to generalization
accuracy, highlighting its compatibility and scalability. This dataset provides
a valuable benchmark for developing and evaluating stereo algorithms under

### [39] [SmokeBench: A Real-World Dataset for Surveillance Image Desmoking in Early-Stage Fire Scenes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12701)
*Wenzhuo Jin,Qianfeng Yang,Xianhao Wu,Hongming Chen,Pengpeng Li,Xiang Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一个名为SmokeBench的真实世界监控图像去烟基准数据集，包含不同场景设置和烟雾浓度的图像对，用于推进火灾场景中的图像去烟研究。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 早期火灾场景（点火后0-15分钟）是紧急干预的关键时间窗口，但烟雾会显著降低监控系统的可见度，影响应急响应和救援操作。目前缺乏大规模真实世界的无烟-有烟配对图像数据集，限制了去烟算法的发展。

Method: 构建了一个真实世界的监控图像去烟基准数据集SmokeBench，包含在不同场景设置和烟雾浓度下捕获的精确对齐的退化图像和清晰图像对，支持监督学习和严格评估。

Result: 在数据集上对各种去烟方法进行了全面的基准测试实验，为推进真实火灾场景中鲁棒实用的图像去烟提供了宝贵基础。

Conclusion: SmokeBench数据集已公开发布，可用于下载，为解决火灾早期烟雾遮挡问题提供了重要的数据资源，有助于提升监控系统在火灾应急响应中的有效性。

Abstract: Early-stage fire scenes (0-15 minutes after ignition) represent a crucial
temporal window for emergency interventions. During this stage, the smoke
produced by combustion significantly reduces the visibility of surveillance
systems, severely impairing situational awareness and hindering effective
emergency response and rescue operations. Consequently, there is an urgent need
to remove smoke from images to obtain clear scene information. However, the
development of smoke removal algorithms remains limited due to the lack of
large-scale, real-world datasets comprising paired smoke-free and
smoke-degraded images. To address these limitations, we present a real-world
surveillance image desmoking benchmark dataset named SmokeBench, which contains
image pairs captured under diverse scenes setup and smoke concentration. The
curated dataset provides precisely aligned degraded and clean images, enabling
supervised learning and rigorous evaluation. We conduct comprehensive
experiments by benchmarking a variety of desmoking methods on our dataset. Our
dataset provides a valuable foundation for advancing robust and practical image
desmoking in real-world fire scenes. This dataset has been released to the
public and can be downloaded from https://github.com/ncfjd/SmokeBench.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出RIS-FUSION框架，通过联合优化统一图像融合和参考图像分割任务，利用文本指导红外和可见光图像融合，并在新构建的大规模数据集MM-RIS上取得SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本驱动的红外和可见光图像融合方法缺乏目标对齐的任务来监督和评估文本输入对融合结果的有效贡献。观察到参考图像分割(RIS)和文本驱动融合具有共同目标：突出文本所指的对象。

Method: 提出级联框架RIS-FUSION，包含LangGatedFusion模块将文本特征注入融合主干网络以增强语义对齐。构建MM-RIS大规模基准数据集，包含12.5k训练和3.5k测试三元组（红外-可见光图像对、分割掩码和参考表达式）。

Result: 在广泛实验中，RIS-FUSION实现了最先进的性能，mIoU指标超过现有方法11%以上。

Conclusion: 通过联合优化融合和参考图像分割任务，RIS-FUSION框架有效解决了文本驱动图像融合中的语义对齐问题，为多模态图像处理提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Text-driven infrared and visible image fusion has gained attention for
enabling natural language to guide the fusion process. However, existing
methods lack a goal-aligned task to supervise and evaluate how effectively the
input text contributes to the fusion outcome. We observe that referring image
segmentation (RIS) and text-driven fusion share a common objective:
highlighting the object referred to by the text. Motivated by this, we propose
RIS-FUSION, a cascaded framework that unifies fusion and RIS through joint
optimization. At its core is the LangGatedFusion module, which injects textual
features into the fusion backbone to enhance semantic alignment. To support
multimodal referring image segmentation task, we introduce MM-RIS, a
large-scale benchmark with 12.5k training and 3.5k testing triplets, each
consisting of an infrared-visible image pair, a segmentation mask, and a
referring expression. Extensive experiments show that RIS-FUSION achieves
state-of-the-art performance, outperforming existing methods by over 11% in
mIoU. Code and dataset will be released at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DeFA方法通过解构-重构特征增强和去偏策略，解决了组合零样本学习中的特征纠缠和长尾分布问题，在闭式和开式场景下都达到了最先进性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 组合零样本学习面临属性和对象特征纠缠以及现实数据长尾分布的挑战，受神经科学发现启发，提出通过特征增强来提升组合泛化能力

Method: 提出Debiased Feature Augmentation (DeFA)方法，包含解构-重构框架进行特征增强，结合去偏策略，利用已见属性和对象的先验知识合成高保真组合特征

Result: 在三个广泛使用的数据集上进行大量实验，DeFA在闭式和开式设置下都实现了最先进的性能

Conclusion: DeFA通过特征增强和去偏策略有效解决了CZSL中的关键挑战，为组合零样本学习提供了新的解决方案

Abstract: Compositional Zero-Shot Learning (CZSL) aims to recognize unseen
attribute-object compositions by learning prior knowledge of seen primitives,
\textit{i.e.}, attributes and objects. Learning generalizable compositional
representations in CZSL remains challenging due to the entangled nature of
attributes and objects as well as the prevalence of long-tailed distributions
in real-world data. Inspired by neuroscientific findings that imagination and
perception share similar neural processes, we propose a novel approach called
Debiased Feature Augmentation (DeFA) to address these challenges. The proposed
DeFA integrates a disentangle-and-reconstruct framework for feature
augmentation with a debiasing strategy. DeFA explicitly leverages the prior
knowledge of seen attributes and objects by synthesizing high-fidelity
composition features to support compositional generalization. Extensive
experiments on three widely used datasets demonstrate that DeFA achieves
state-of-the-art performance in both \textit{closed-world} and
\textit{open-world} settings.

TL;DR: AsyMoE是一种新颖的视觉-语言混合专家架构，通过专门设计的专家组解决视觉和语言处理的不对称性问题，在减少参数激活的同时显著提升性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有混合专家方法在处理视觉和语言模态时面临不对称性挑战，视觉信息具有空间完整性而语言需要保持序列上下文，导致深层语言专家逐渐失去上下文基础并过度依赖参数知识

Method: 提出AsyMoE架构，包含三个专家组：模态内专家处理特定模态特征，双曲跨模态专家处理层次化跨模态交互，证据优先语言专家抑制参数偏差并保持上下文基础

Result: 相比普通MoE和模态特定MoE分别实现26.58%和15.45%的准确率提升，同时比密集模型减少25.45%的激活参数

Conclusion: AsyMoE通过建模视觉-语言不对称性，有效解决了现有MoE方法在跨模态任务中的局限性，在性能和效率方面都取得了显著改进

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance
on multimodal tasks through scaled architectures and extensive training.
However, existing Mixture of Experts (MoE) approaches face challenges due to
the asymmetry between visual and linguistic processing. Visual information is
spatially complete, while language requires maintaining sequential context. As
a result, MoE models struggle to balance modality-specific features and
cross-modal interactions. Through systematic analysis, we observe that language
experts in deeper layers progressively lose contextual grounding and rely more
on parametric knowledge rather than utilizing the provided visual and
linguistic information. To address this, we propose AsyMoE, a novel
architecture that models this asymmetry using three specialized expert groups.
We design intra-modality experts for modality-specific processing, hyperbolic
inter-modality experts for hierarchical cross-modal interactions, and
evidence-priority language experts to suppress parametric biases and maintain
contextual grounding. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AsyMoE achieves
26.58% and 15.45% accuracy improvements over vanilla MoE and modality-specific
MoE respectively, with 25.45% fewer activated parameters than dense models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了两个动态空间推理基准测试，用于评估模型在局部可观测、动态变化环境中的空间理解和自适应规划能力，揭示了主流模型在动态空间推理和长期记忆方面的关键局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有空间推理基准主要关注静态或全局可观测环境，无法捕捉在部分可观测和动态变化条件下进行长时程推理和记忆利用的挑战。

Method: 引入了两个动态空间基准测试：局部可观测迷宫导航和match-2消除任务，并提出了基于主观经验的记忆机制来实现跨任务经验迁移和验证。

Result: 实验表明，该基准测试能够系统性地揭示主流模型在动态空间推理和长期记忆方面的关键局限性。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了一个全面的平台来推动未来方法学进步，代码和数据已公开可用。

Abstract: Most existing spatial reasoning benchmarks focus on static or globally
observable environments, failing to capture the challenges of long-horizon
reasoning and memory utilization under partial observability and dynamic
changes. We introduce two dynamic spatial benchmarks, locally observable maze
navigation and match-2 elimination that systematically evaluate models'
abilities in spatial understanding and adaptive planning when local perception,
environment feedback, and global objectives are tightly coupled. Each action
triggers structural changes in the environment, requiring continuous update of
cognition and strategy. We further propose a subjective experience-based memory
mechanism for cross-task experience transfer and validation. Experiments show
that our benchmarks reveal key limitations of mainstream models in dynamic
spatial reasoning and long-term memory, providing a comprehensive platform for
future methodological advances. Our code and data are available at

*Jingdong Zhang,Weikai Chen,Yuan Liu,Jionghao Wang,Zhengming Yu,Zhuowen Shen,Bo Yang,Wenping Wang,Xin Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SPGen提出了一种基于球面投影的单视图3D生成方法，通过将几何信息投影到边界球面并展开为多层2D表示，解决了多视图不一致性问题，同时支持复杂内部结构和拓扑表示。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的单视图3D生成模型依赖多视图扩散先验，容易产生视图间不一致问题，且无法准确表示复杂内部结构和非平凡拓扑。需要一种能够同时保证一致性、灵活性和效率的新方法。

Method: 提出球面投影(SP)表示方法，将几何信息投影到边界球面并展开为紧凑的多层2D图像表示。该方法完全在图像域操作，继承强大的2D扩散先验，支持高效微调。

Result: 实验表明SPGen在几何质量和计算效率方面显著优于现有基线方法，能够生成更一致、更灵活的3D几何表示。

Conclusion: SPGen通过球面投影表示成功解决了单视图3D生成中的视图不一致问题，同时提供了处理复杂内部结构和高效计算的解决方案，为3D生成领域提供了新的有效方法。

Abstract: Existing single-view 3D generative models typically adopt multiview diffusion
priors to reconstruct object surfaces, yet they remain prone to inter-view
inconsistencies and are unable to faithfully represent complex internal
structure or nontrivial topologies. In particular, we encode geometry
information by projecting it onto a bounding sphere and unwrapping it into a
compact and structural multi-layer 2D Spherical Projection (SP) representation.
Operating solely in the image domain, SPGen offers three key advantages
simultaneously: (1) Consistency. The injective SP mapping encodes surface
geometry with a single viewpoint which naturally eliminates view inconsistency
and ambiguity; (2) Flexibility. Multi-layer SP maps represent nested internal
structures and support direct lifting to watertight or open 3D surfaces; (3)
Efficiency. The image-domain formulation allows the direct inheritance of
powerful 2D diffusion priors and enables efficient finetuning with limited
computational resources. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SPGen
significantly outperforms existing baselines in geometric quality and
computational efficiency.

TL;DR: Defense2Attack是一种新颖的视觉语言模型越狱方法，通过将防御机制融入攻击流程，在单次尝试中就能高效绕过VLM的安全防护


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管现有的越狱攻击取得了一定进展，但其效果和效率仍有提升空间。研究发现将弱防御机制整合到攻击流程中可以显著提升越狱的效果和效率

Method: 包含三个核心组件：(1)视觉优化器：嵌入具有肯定和鼓励语义的通用对抗扰动；(2)文本优化器：使用防御风格提示优化输入；(3)红队后缀生成器：通过强化微调增强越狱效果

Result: 在4个VLM模型和4个安全基准测试上验证，Defense2Attack在单次尝试中就实现了优越的越狱性能，超越了需要多次尝试的最先进攻击方法

Conclusion: 这项工作为越狱视觉语言模型提供了新的视角，展示了利用防御模式来指导越狱提示设计的有效性

Abstract: Despite their superb capabilities, Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have been
shown to be vulnerable to jailbreak attacks. While recent jailbreaks have
achieved notable progress, their effectiveness and efficiency can still be
improved. In this work, we reveal an interesting phenomenon: incorporating weak
defense into the attack pipeline can significantly enhance both the
effectiveness and the efficiency of jailbreaks on VLMs. Building on this
insight, we propose Defense2Attack, a novel jailbreak method that bypasses the
safety guardrails of VLMs by leveraging defensive patterns to guide jailbreak
prompt design. Specifically, Defense2Attack consists of three key components:
(1) a visual optimizer that embeds universal adversarial perturbations with
affirmative and encouraging semantics; (2) a textual optimizer that refines the
input using a defense-styled prompt; and (3) a red-team suffix generator that
enhances the jailbreak through reinforcement fine-tuning. We empirically
evaluate our method on four VLMs and four safety benchmarks. The results
demonstrate that Defense2Attack achieves superior jailbreak performance in a
single attempt, outperforming state-of-the-art attack methods that often
require multiple tries. Our work offers a new perspective on jailbreaking VLMs.

Motivation: 解决在动态多样的室内环境中采集高质量RF数据的挑战，提供隐私保护的感知替代方案。

Method: 结合语言引导的4D世界生成器（包含状态感知因果变换器用于人体运动生成）和相位相干射线追踪模拟器，生成准确的RF信号。

Result: 在条件人体运动生成方面表现有效，相位相干性成功应用于波束成形和呼吸监测，在RF成像数据生成和人类活动识别任务中均取得性能提升。

Conclusion: WaveVerse首次实现了RF成像的数据生成，在数据有限和数据充足场景下都能带来一致的性能增益，为RF感知研究提供了有效的仿真解决方案。

Abstract: Radio Frequency (RF) sensing has emerged as a powerful, privacy-preserving
alternative to vision-based methods for indoor perception tasks. However,
collecting high-quality RF data in dynamic and diverse indoor environments
remains a major challenge. To address this, we introduce WaveVerse, a
prompt-based, scalable framework that simulates realistic RF signals from
generated indoor scenes with human motions. WaveVerse introduces a
language-guided 4D world generator, which includes a state-aware causal
transformer for human motion generation conditioned on spatial constraints and
texts, and a phase-coherent ray tracing simulator that enables the simulation
of accurate and coherent RF signals. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness
of our approach in conditioned human motion generation and highlight how phase
coherence is applied to beamforming and respiration monitoring. We further
present two case studies in ML-based high-resolution imaging and human activity
recognition, demonstrating that WaveVerse not only enables data generation for
RF imaging for the first time, but also consistently achieves performance gain
in both data-limited and data-adequate scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有高斯泼溅方法采用无差别属性分配导致梯度冲突和效率低下，需要更智能的高斯管理策略来提升重建质量和效率。

Method: 引入动态激活球谐函数或法向量的致密化策略，基于梯度幅度自适应调整SH阶数，执行任务解耦剪枝来移除对重建任务影响最小的高斯。

Result: 在重建质量和效率方面持续优于最先进方法，以显著更少的参数实现优越性能，模型大小减少的同时提升性能。

Conclusion: 提出的高斯管理方法是模型无关的，可无缝集成到其他框架中，在保持高性能的同时显著减少参数数量，为高保真物体重建提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: This paper proposes an effective Gaussian management approach for
high-fidelity object reconstruction. Departing from recent Gaussian Splatting
(GS) methods that employ indiscriminate attribute assignment, our approach
introduces a novel densification strategy that dynamically activates spherical
harmonics (SHs) or normals under the supervision of a surface reconstruction
module, which effectively mitigates the gradient conflicts caused by dual
supervision and achieves superior reconstruction results. To further improve
representation efficiency, we develop a lightweight Gaussian representation
that adaptively adjusts the SH orders of each Gaussian based on gradient
magnitudes and performs task-decoupled pruning to remove Gaussian with minimal
impact on a reconstruction task without sacrificing others, which balances the
representational capacity with parameter quantity. Notably, our management
approach is model-agnostic and can be seamlessly integrated into other
frameworks, enhancing performance while reducing model size. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art approaches in both reconstruction quality and efficiency,
achieving superior performance with significantly fewer parameters.

Motivation: 研究深度可分离深度网络中学习到的感受野特性，验证这些学习到的滤波器是否可以通过可分离的空间滤波操作来建模，并探索用理想化的离散尺度空间滤波器替代学习滤波器的可行性。

Method: 首先计算学习滤波器绝对值的加权均值和加权方差作为空间扩散度量，然后使用高斯核的离散模拟进行空间平滑操作的差分算子来建模主关键滤波器，采用两种不同的尺度参数设置方式，并通过空间方差相等或最小化l1/l2范数进行模型拟合。

Conclusion: 深度可分离深度网络中学习到的滤波器可以很好地用离散尺度空间滤波器近似，这为理解神经网络中学习到的特征表示提供了理论依据，并展示了用理想化滤波器替代学习滤波器的可行性。

Abstract: This paper presents the results of analysing and modelling a set of 8
``master key filters'', which have been extracted by applying a clustering
approach to the receptive fields learned in depthwise-separable deep networks
based on the ConvNeXt architecture.
  For this purpose, we first compute spatial spread measures in terms of
weighted mean values and weighted variances of the absolute values of the
learned filters, which support the working hypotheses that: (i) the learned
filters can be modelled by separable filtering operations over the spatial
domain, and that (ii) the spatial offsets of the those learned filters that are
non-centered are rather close to half a grid unit. Then, we model the clustered
``master key filters'' in terms of difference operators applied to a spatial
smoothing operation in terms of the discrete analogue of the Gaussian kernel,
and demonstrate that the resulting idealized models of the receptive fields
show good qualitative similarity to the learned filters.
  This modelling is performed in two different ways: (i) using possibly
different values of the scale parameters in the coordinate directions for each
filter, and (ii) using the same value of the scale parameter in both coordinate
directions. Then, we perform the actual model fitting by either (i) requiring
spatial spread measures in terms of spatial variances of the absolute values of
the receptive fields to be equal, or (ii) minimizing the discrete $l_1$- or
$l_2$-norms between the idealized receptive field models and the learned
filters.
  Complementary experimental results then demonstrate the idealized models of
receptive fields have good predictive properties for replacing the learned
filters by idealized filters in depthwise-separable deep networks, thus showing
that the learned filters in depthwise-separable deep networks can be well
approximated by discrete scale-space filters.

TL;DR: 本文研究了多模态LLM与人类在评估文本生成图像质量时的差异，发现LLM在理解图像美学、解剖准确性等属性方面与人类存在显著差异


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动化评估文本生成图像模型具有挑战性，现有研究使用多模态LLM进行图像质量评估，但缺乏对LLM如何利用人类相关概念（如图像风格、构图等）的深入理解

Method: 首先通过合成生成的图像对构建人类偏好数据集，分析图像质量属性间的相关性；然后对LLM进行相同分析；最后针对单个图像质量属性生成高度可控的合成数据集进行研究

Result: 人类能够轻松判断所有特定图像质量属性，但LLM在属性间的关系较弱，某些属性（如解剖准确性）对LLM来说更难学习判断

Conclusion: 研究发现揭示了人类和多模态LLM在图像感知方面存在有趣差异，LLM在理解某些人类重视的图像质量属性方面仍有局限

Abstract: Automated evaluation of generative text-to-image models remains a challenging
problem. Recent works have proposed using multimodal LLMs to judge the quality
of images, but these works offer little insight into how multimodal LLMs make
use of concepts relevant to humans, such as image style or composition, to
generate their overall assessment. In this work, we study what attributes of an
image--specifically aesthetics, lack of artifacts, anatomical accuracy,
compositional correctness, object adherence, and style--are important for both
LLMs and humans to make judgments on image quality. We first curate a dataset
of human preferences using synthetically generated image pairs. We use
inter-task correlation between each pair of image quality attributes to
understand which attributes are related in making human judgments. Repeating
the same analysis with LLMs, we find that the relationships between image
quality attributes are much weaker. Finally, we study individual image quality
attributes by generating synthetic datasets with a high degree of control for
each axis. Humans are able to easily judge the quality of an image with respect
to all of the specific image quality attributes (e.g. high vs. low aesthetic
image), however we find that some attributes, such as anatomical accuracy, are
much more difficult for multimodal LLMs to learn to judge. Taken together,
these findings reveal interesting differences between how humans and multimodal
LLMs perceive images.

TL;DR: ReCOT是一个循环跨视角目标地理定位Transformer，将CVOGL任务重新定义为循环定位问题，通过可学习token迭代优化位置预测，结合SAM知识蒸馏和分层注意力机制，在减少60%参数的同时达到SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将跨视角目标地理定位视为一次性检测任务，直接回归目标位置，容易受到特征噪声影响且缺乏错误校正机制。

Method: 提出循环跨视角目标地理定位Transformer(ReCOT)，使用可学习token编码查询意图，迭代优化位置预测；集成SAM知识蒸馏策略提供语义指导；引入参考特征增强模块(RFEM)使用分层注意力强调目标相关区域。

Result: 在标准CVOGL基准测试中达到最先进性能，同时比之前SOTA方法减少60%参数。

Conclusion: ReCOT通过循环定位框架、知识蒸馏和分层注意力机制，有效解决了跨视角目标地理定位中的噪声和错误校正问题，实现了高效准确的地理定位。

Abstract: Cross-view object geo-localization (CVOGL) aims to determine the location of
a specific object in high-resolution satellite imagery given a query image with
a point prompt. Existing approaches treat CVOGL as a one-shot detection task,
directly regressing object locations from cross-view information aggregation,
but they are vulnerable to feature noise and lack mechanisms for error
correction. In this paper, we propose ReCOT, a Recurrent Cross-view Object
geo-localization Transformer, which reformulates CVOGL as a recurrent
localization task. ReCOT introduces a set of learnable tokens that encode
task-specific intent from the query image and prompt embeddings, and
iteratively attend to the reference features to refine the predicted location.
To enhance this recurrent process, we incorporate two complementary modules:
(1) a SAM-based knowledge distillation strategy that transfers segmentation
priors from the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to provide clearer semantic
guidance without additional inference cost, and (2) a Reference Feature
Enhancement Module (RFEM) that introduces a hierarchical attention to emphasize
object-relevant regions in the reference features. Extensive experiments on
standard CVOGL benchmarks demonstrate that ReCOT achieves state-of-the-art
(SOTA) performance while reducing parameters by 60% compared to previous SOTA
approaches.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统TDOM生成方法依赖复杂的离线摄影测量流程，存在延迟问题，且质量可能因相机位姿不准确、DSM误差和场景遮挡而下降，无法满足实时应用需求。

Method: 采用基于实时3D高斯溅射(3DGS)优化的方法，通过在线SfM计算每幅图像的位姿和稀疏点云，将新高斯点集成并优化到先前未见或粗略重建区域，结合正交溅射技术实现实时渲染。

Result: 在多个基准测试上的初步实验表明，A-TDOM能够以近实时方式主动渲染TDOM，每幅新图像的3DGS优化仅需数秒，同时保持可接受的渲染质量和TDOM几何精度。

Conclusion: A-TDOM方法成功解决了传统TDOM生成的延迟问题，实现了近实时的真数字正射影像图生成，为城市管理、城市规划等领域的实时应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: True Digital Orthophoto Map (TDOM) serves as a crucial geospatial product in
various fields such as urban management, city planning, land surveying, etc.
However, traditional TDOM generation methods generally rely on a complex
offline photogrammetric pipeline, resulting in delays that hinder real-time
applications. Moreover, the quality of TDOM may degrade due to various
challenges, such as inaccurate camera poses or Digital Surface Model (DSM) and
scene occlusions. To address these challenges, this work introduces A-TDOM, a
near real-time TDOM generation method based on On-the-Fly 3DGS optimization. As
each image is acquired, its pose and sparse point cloud are computed via
On-the-Fly SfM. Then new Gaussians are integrated and optimized into previously
unseen or coarsely reconstructed regions. By integrating with orthogonal
splatting, A-TDOM can render just after each update of a new 3DGS field.
Initial experiments on multiple benchmarks show that the proposed A-TDOM is
capable of actively rendering TDOM in near real-time, with 3DGS optimization
for each new image in seconds while maintaining acceptable rendering quality
and TDOM geometric accuracy.

Abstract: Medical image segmentation grapples with challenges including multi-scale
lesion variability, ill-defined tissue boundaries, and computationally
intensive processing demands. This paper proposes the DyGLNet, which achieves
efficient and accurate segmentation by fusing global and local features with a
dynamic upsampling mechanism. The model innovatively designs a hybrid feature
extraction module (SHDCBlock), combining single-head self-attention and
multi-scale dilated convolutions to model local details and global context
collaboratively. We further introduce a dynamic adaptive upsampling module
(DyFusionUp) to realize high-fidelity reconstruction of feature maps based on
learnable offsets. Then, a lightweight design is adopted to reduce
computational overhead. Experiments on seven public datasets demonstrate that
DyGLNet outperforms existing methods, particularly excelling in boundary
accuracy and small-object segmentation. Meanwhile, it exhibits lower
computation complexity, enabling an efficient and reliable solution for
clinical medical image analysis. The code will be made available soon.

### [53] [BATR-FST: Bi-Level Adaptive Token Refinement for Few-Shot Transformers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12768)
*Mohammed Al-Habib,Zuping Zhang,Abdulrahman Noman*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BATR-FST是一个用于少样本学习的双层级自适应token优化方法，通过token聚类、不确定性感知加权和双层级注意力机制，在Vision Transformers上实现了优异的少样本分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Vision Transformers在少样本学习中面临token级交互优化不足、训练数据有限和归纳偏置不强等挑战，现有方法依赖不灵活的token匹配或简单相似度度量，限制了全局上下文和局部特征优化的有效整合。

Method: 提出双阶段方法：预训练阶段使用掩码图像建模获得可迁移的patch级表示；元微调阶段包含双层级自适应token优化模块（token聚类、不确定性感知token加权、双层级注意力机制）、图token传播确保支持集和查询集的语义一致性，以及类分离惩罚保持类间边界。

Result: 在三个基准少样本数据集上的广泛实验表明，BATR-FST在1-shot和5-shot场景下均取得了优异结果，显著提升了transformer的少样本分类性能。

Conclusion: BATR-FST通过渐进式token表示优化和保持强归纳偏置，有效解决了Vision Transformers在少样本学习中的关键挑战，为transformer在少样本分类中的应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have shown significant promise in computer vision
applications. However, their performance in few-shot learning is limited by
challenges in refining token-level interactions, struggling with limited
training data, and developing a strong inductive bias. Existing methods often
depend on inflexible token matching or basic similarity measures, which limit
the effective incorporation of global context and localized feature refinement.
To address these challenges, we propose Bi-Level Adaptive Token Refinement for
Few-Shot Transformers (BATR-FST), a two-stage approach that progressively
improves token representations and maintains a robust inductive bias for
few-shot classification. During the pre-training phase, Masked Image Modeling
(MIM) provides Vision Transformers (ViTs) with transferable patch-level
representations by recreating masked image regions, providing a robust basis
for subsequent adaptation. In the meta-fine-tuning phase, BATR-FST incorporates
a Bi-Level Adaptive Token Refinement module that utilizes Token Clustering to
capture localized interactions, Uncertainty-Aware Token Weighting to prioritize
dependable features, and a Bi-Level Attention mechanism to balance
intra-cluster and inter-cluster relationships, thereby facilitating thorough
token refinement. Furthermore, Graph Token Propagation ensures semantic
consistency between support and query instances, while a Class Separation
Penalty preserves different class borders, enhancing discriminative capability.
Extensive experiments on three benchmark few-shot datasets demonstrate that
BATR-FST achieves superior results in both 1-shot and 5-shot scenarios and
improves the few-shot classification via transformers.

Motivation: 胰腺肿瘤高度异质性和变异性给精确亚型诊断带来挑战，现有方法未能有效利用放射科医生诊断工作流中常用的多期相CECT上下文信息。

Conclusion: 该方法可作为更准确高效的胰腺肿瘤亚型诊断工具，首次实现了多期相CECT数据的自动融合用于胰腺肿瘤亚型鉴别。

Abstract: Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) is the primary imaging technique
that provides valuable spatial-temporal information about lesions, enabling the
accurate diagnosis and subclassification of pancreatic tumors. However, the
high heterogeneity and variability of pancreatic tumors still pose substantial
challenges for precise subtyping diagnosis. Previous methods fail to
effectively explore the contextual information across multiple CECT phases
commonly used in radiologists' diagnostic workflows, thereby limiting their
performance. In this paper, we introduce, for the first time, an automatic way
to combine the multi-phase CECT data to discriminate between pancreatic tumor
subtypes, among which the key is using Mamba with promising learnability and
simplicity to encourage both temporal and spatial modeling from multi-phase
CECT. Specifically, we propose a dual hierarchical contrast-enhanced-aware
Mamba module incorporating two novel spatial and temporal sampling sequences to
explore intra and inter-phase contrast variations of lesions. A
similarity-guided refinement module is also imposed into the temporal scanning
modeling to emphasize the learning on local tumor regions with more obvious
temporal variations. Moreover, we design the space complementary integrator and
multi-granularity fusion module to encode and aggregate the semantics across
different scales, achieving more efficient learning for subtyping pancreatic
tumors. The experimental results on an in-house dataset of 270 clinical cases
achieve an accuracy of 97.4% and an AUC of 98.6% in distinguishing between
pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors
(PNETs), demonstrating its potential as a more accurate and efficient tool.

Motivation: 解决现有两阶段人-物交互检测方法在上下文建模不完整的问题，特别是处理涉及辅助实体（如工具）的复杂交互关系

Method: 扩展传统人-物交互检测框架，引入三元组结构<人、工具、物体>来显式建模辅助对象的功能角色，使用可学习提示与上下文视觉特征通过注意力机制进行整合

Result: 在HICO-Det和V-COCO数据集的大多数场景中表现出优越性能

Conclusion: 通过上下文化表示学习，模型能够更好地捕捉复杂、依赖上下文的交互关系，为人-物交互检测提供了更可靠的推理能力

Abstract: Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection aims to simultaneously localize
human-object pairs and recognize their interactions. While recent two-stage
approaches have made significant progress, they still face challenges due to
incomplete context modeling. In this work, we introduce a Contextualized
Representation Learning Network that integrates both affordance-guided
reasoning and contextual prompts with visual cues to better capture complex
interactions. We enhance the conventional HOI detection framework by expanding
it beyond simple human-object pairs to include multivariate relationships
involving auxiliary entities like tools. Specifically, we explicitly model the
functional role (affordance) of these auxiliary objects through triplet
structures <human, tool, object>. This enables our model to identify
tool-dependent interactions such as 'filling'. Furthermore, the learnable
prompt is enriched with instance categories and subsequently integrated with
contextual visual features using an attention mechanism. This process aligns
language with image content at both global and regional levels. These
contextualized representations equip the model with enriched relational cues
for more reliable reasoning over complex, context-dependent interactions. Our
proposed method demonstrates superior performance on both the HICO-Det and
V-COCO datasets in most scenarios. Codes will be released upon acceptance.

Conclusion: DH-Diff通过创新的双螺旋设计和域解耦机制，有效解决了异常合成中的结构一致性和特征纠缠问题，为制造业视觉检测提供了高质量的数据增强方案。

Abstract: Visual anomaly inspection is critical in manufacturing, yet hampered by the
scarcity of real anomaly samples for training robust detectors. Synthetic data
generation presents a viable strategy for data augmentation; however, current
methods remain constrained by two principal limitations: 1) the generation of
anomalies that are structurally inconsistent with the normal background, and 2)
the presence of undesirable feature entanglement between synthesized images and
their corresponding annotation masks, which undermines the perceptual realism
of the output. This paper introduces Double Helix Diffusion (DH-Diff), a novel
cross-domain generative framework designed to simultaneously synthesize
high-fidelity anomaly images and their pixel-level annotation masks, explicitly
addressing these challenges. DH-Diff employs a unique architecture inspired by
a double helix, cycling through distinct modules for feature separation,
connection, and merging. Specifically, a domain-decoupled attention mechanism
mitigates feature entanglement by enhancing image and annotation features
independently, and meanwhile a semantic score map alignment module ensures
structural authenticity by coherently integrating anomaly foregrounds. DH-Diff
offers flexible control via text prompts and optional graphical guidance.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that DH-Diff significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in diversity and authenticity, leading to significant
improvements in downstream anomaly detection performance.

TL;DR: SPAM是一个新颖的超像素分割框架，结合深度学习特征提取和大规模预训练模型，能够生成既准确又规则的超像素分割结果


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统超像素方法依赖低层特征，而深度学习方法虽然利用高层特征但牺牲了超像素的规则性，导致分割结果准确但可解释性差

Method: 训练模型提取图像特征用于超像素生成，推理时利用大规模预训练模型进行语义无关分割，确保超像素与物体掩码对齐，并能处理任何先验高层分割和不确定区域

Result: 综合实验表明SPAM在分割任务上定性和定量都优于最先进方法

Conclusion: SPAM是一个有价值且鲁棒的工具，适用于各种应用场景

Abstract: Superpixels are widely used in computer vision to simplify image
representation and reduce computational complexity. While traditional methods
rely on low-level features, deep learning-based approaches leverage high-level
features but also tend to sacrifice regularity of superpixels to capture
complex objects, leading to accurate but less interpretable segmentations. In
this work, we introduce SPAM (SuperPixel Anything Model), a versatile framework
for segmenting images into accurate yet regular superpixels. We train a model
to extract image features for superpixel generation, and at inference, we
leverage a large-scale pretrained model for semantic-agnostic segmentation to
ensure that superpixels align with object masks. SPAM can handle any prior
high-level segmentation, resolving uncertainty regions, and is able to
interactively focus on specific objects. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate
that SPAM qualitatively and quantitatively outperforms state-of-the-art methods
on segmentation tasks, making it a valuable and robust tool for various
applications. Code and pre-trained models are available here:

TL;DR: SAGA提出选择性自适应门控机制，通过输入自适应学习门来选择性调制KV特征图的信息聚合，解决线性注意力中均匀压缩导致特征冗余和低秩约束的问题，在保持线性复杂度同时提升表达能力和计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer的softmax注意力机制存在二次复杂度瓶颈，线性注意力虽然将复杂度降至线性但通过均匀压缩历史KV信息会导致特征冗余和丢失与查询的方向对齐，造成性能差距。

Method: 提出选择性自适应门控(SAGA)，引入输入自适应可学习门来选择性调制KV特征图的信息聚合，增强语义多样性并缓解低秩约束；同时提出高效的Hadamard乘积分解方法进行门计算，不增加额外内存开销。

Result: 在1280×1280分辨率下，相比PVT-T实现了1.76倍吞吐量提升和2.69倍峰值GPU内存减少；在ImageNet数据集上top-1准确率提升高达4.4%。

Conclusion: SAGA在线性注意力框架中有效解决了特征冗余和低秩约束问题，在保持计算效率的同时显著提升了模型性能，为高效视觉Transformer提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: While Transformer architecture excel at modeling long-range dependencies
contributing to its widespread adoption in vision tasks the quadratic
complexity of softmax-based attention mechanisms imposes a major bottleneck,
particularly when processing high-resolution images. Linear attention presents
a promising alternative by reformulating the attention computation from $(QK)V$
to $Q(KV)$, thereby reducing the complexity from $\mathcal{O}(N^2)$ to
$\mathcal{O}(N)$ while preserving the global receptive field. However, most
existing methods compress historical key-value (KV) information uniformly,
which can lead to feature redundancy and the loss of directional alignment with
the query (Q). This uniform compression results in low-rank $KV$ feature maps,
contributing to a performance gap compared to softmax attention. To mitigate
this limitation, we propose \textbf{S}elective \textbf{A}daptive
\textbf{GA}ting for Efficient and Expressive Linear Attention (SAGA) , which
introduces input-adaptive learnable gates to selectively modulate information
aggregation into the $KV$ feature map. These gates enhance semantic diversity
and alleviate the low-rank constraint inherent in conventional linear
attention. Additionally, we propose an efficient Hadamard-product decomposition
method for gate computation, which introduces no additional memory overhead.
Experiments demonstrate that SAGA achieves a 1.76$\times$ improvement in
throughput and a 2.69$\times$ reduction in peak GPU memory compared to PVT-T at
a resolution of $1280 \times 1280$. Moreover, it improves top-1 accuracy by up
to 4.4\% on the ImageNet dataset, demonstrating both computational efficiency
and model effectiveness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗影像基础模型受限于较小数据集规模，需要系统研究数据规模和预训练范式对医疗影像性能的影响，以理解如何通过领域特定数据提升模型表现。

Method: 使用单一机构的350万张胸部X光片，在保持计算和评估协议不变的情况下，对代表CLIP和DINOv2两种主要编码器范式的MedImageInsight和RAD-DINO进行持续预训练，评估分类、分割和放射报告生成任务。

Result: MI2在放射发现相关任务上扩展性更好，RAD-DINO在导管相关任务上更强；使用UniCL结合报告和结构化标签持续预训练MI2能提升性能；仅需3万张领域内样本即可在某些任务上超越开放权重基础模型。

Conclusion: 医疗机构的特定持续预训练具有重要价值，利用领域内数据可以获得显著的性能提升，这为医疗机构定制化模型开发提供了实用指导。

Abstract: Foundation vision encoders such as CLIP and DINOv2, trained on web-scale
data, exhibit strong transfer performance across tasks and datasets. However,
medical imaging foundation models remain constrained by smaller datasets,
limiting our understanding of how data scale and pretraining paradigms affect
performance in this setting. In this work, we systematically study continual
pretraining of two vision encoders, MedImageInsight (MI2) and RAD-DINO
representing the two major encoder paradigms CLIP and DINOv2, on up to 3.5M
chest x-rays from a single institution, holding compute and evaluation
protocols constant. We evaluate on classification (radiology findings, lines
and tubes), segmentation (lines and tubes), and radiology report generation.
While prior work has primarily focused on tasks related to radiology findings,
we include lines and tubes tasks to counterbalance this bias and evaluate a
model's ability to extract features that preserve continuity along elongated
structures. Our experiments show that MI2 scales more effectively for
finding-related tasks, while RAD-DINO is stronger on tube-related tasks.
Surprisingly, continually pretraining MI2 with both reports and structured
labels using UniCL improves performance, underscoring the value of structured
supervision at scale. We further show that for some tasks, as few as 30k
in-domain samples are sufficient to surpass open-weights foundation models.
These results highlight the utility of center-specific continual pretraining,
enabling medical institutions to derive significant performance gains by
utilizing in-domain data.

Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have demonstrated significant potential in
synthesizing novel viewpoints. Evaluating the NeRF-generated outputs, however,
remains a challenge due to the unique artifacts they exhibit, and no individual
metric performs well across all datasets. We hypothesize that combining two
successful metrics, Deep Image Structure and Texture Similarity (DISTS) and
Video Multi-Method Assessment Fusion (VMAF), based on different perceptual
methods, can overcome the limitations of individual metrics and achieve
improved correlation with subjective quality scores. We experiment with two
normalization strategies for the individual metrics and two fusion strategies
to evaluate their impact on the resulting correlation with the subjective
scores. The proposed pipeline is tested on two distinct datasets, Synthetic and
Outdoor, and its performance is evaluated across three different
configurations. We present a detailed analysis comparing the correlation
coefficients of fusion methods and individual scores with subjective scores to
demonstrate the robustness and generalizability of the fusion metrics.

Conclusion: LLM生成的合成数据具有巨大潜力，特别适用于罕见疾病中的数据稀缺问题，虽然方法针对医疗领域定制，但见解和技术可适用于其他领域

Abstract: It is well-established that more data generally improves AI model
performance. However, data collection can be challenging for certain tasks due
to the rarity of occurrences or high costs. These challenges are evident in our
use case, where we apply AI models to a novel approach for visually documenting
the musculoskeletal condition of dogs. Here, abnormalities are marked as
colored strokes on a body map of a dog. Since these strokes correspond to
distinct muscles or joints, they can be mapped to the textual domain in which
large language models (LLMs) operate. LLMs have demonstrated impressive
capabilities across a wide range of tasks, including medical applications,
offering promising potential for generating synthetic training data. In this
work, we investigate whether LLMs can effectively generate synthetic visual
training data for canine musculoskeletal diagnoses. For this, we developed a
mapping that segments visual documentations into over 200 labeled regions
representing muscles or joints. Using techniques like guided decoding,
chain-of-thought reasoning, and few-shot prompting, we generated 1,000
synthetic visual documentations for patellar luxation (kneecap dislocation)
diagnosis, the diagnosis for which we have the most real-world data. Our
analysis shows that the generated documentations are sensitive to location and
severity of the diagnosis while remaining independent of the dog's sex. We
further generated 1,000 visual documentations for various other diagnoses to
create a binary classification dataset. A model trained solely on this
synthetic data achieved an F1 score of 88% on 70 real-world documentations.
These results demonstrate the potential of LLM-generated synthetic data, which
is particularly valuable for addressing data scarcity in rare diseases. While
our methodology is tailored to the medical domain, the insights and techniques
can be adapted to other fields.

Conclusion: CCS为物体检测器的DevOps式监控提供了稳健的基础，能够突出表现不佳的场景，实现无标注的持续性能评估

Abstract: Evaluating object detection models in deployment is challenging because
ground-truth annotations are rarely available. We introduce the Cumulative
Consensus Score (CCS), a label-free metric that enables continuous monitoring
and comparison of detectors in real-world settings. CCS applies test-time data
augmentation to each image, collects predicted bounding boxes across augmented
views, and computes overlaps using Intersection over Union. Maximum overlaps
are normalized and averaged across augmentation pairs, yielding a measure of
spatial consistency that serves as a proxy for reliability without annotations.
In controlled experiments on Open Images and KITTI, CCS achieved over 90%
congruence with F1-score, Probabilistic Detection Quality, and Optimal
Correction Cost. The method is model-agnostic, working across single-stage and
two-stage detectors, and operates at the case level to highlight
under-performing scenarios. Altogether, CCS provides a robust foundation for
DevOps-style monitoring of object detectors.

Conclusion: 通过利用扩散模型的预训练条件编码器提供通用特征，结合双流学习和原型对齐机制，PENet有效解决了少样本3D点云分割中的关键挑战，取得了优异的性能。

Abstract: Few-shot 3D point cloud semantic segmentation aims to segment novel
categories using a minimal number of annotated support samples. While existing
prototype-based methods have shown promise, they are constrained by two
critical challenges: (1) Intra-class Diversity, where a prototype's limited
representational capacity fails to cover a class's full variations, and (2)
Inter-set Inconsistency, where prototypes derived from the support set are
misaligned with the query feature space. Motivated by the powerful generative
capability of diffusion model, we re-purpose its pre-trained conditional
encoder to provide a novel source of generalizable features for expanding the
prototype's representational range. Under this setup, we introduce the
Prototype Expansion Network (PENet), a framework that constructs big-capacity
prototypes from two complementary feature sources. PENet employs a dual-stream
learner architecture: it retains a conventional fully supervised Intrinsic
Learner (IL) to distill representative features, while introducing a novel
Diffusion Learner (DL) to provide rich generalizable features. The resulting
dual prototypes are then processed by a Prototype Assimilation Module (PAM),
which adopts a novel push-pull cross-guidance attention block to iteratively
align the prototypes with the query space. Furthermore, a Prototype Calibration
Mechanism (PCM) regularizes the final big capacity prototype to prevent
semantic drift. Extensive experiments on the S3DIS and ScanNet datasets
demonstrate that PENet significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods
across various few-shot settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有指令图像编辑方法对训练域外的用户指令泛化能力不足，限制了实际应用。需要解决真实世界用户指令多样性带来的挑战。

Method: 1) 构建包含多样化模型和图像处理功能的模型级工具包；2) 采用三阶段渐进式强化学习方法，利用无标注开放域指令的反馈训练MLLM。

Conclusion: Lego-Edit通过MLLM组织模型级编辑工具，有效解决了指令图像编辑的泛化问题，为实际应用提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Instruction-based image editing has garnered significant attention due to its
direct interaction with users. However, real-world user instructions are
immensely diverse, and existing methods often fail to generalize effectively to
instructions outside their training domain, limiting their practical
application. To address this, we propose Lego-Edit, which leverages the
generalization capability of Multi-modal Large Language Model (MLLM) to
organize a suite of model-level editing tools to tackle this challenge.
Lego-Edit incorporates two key designs: (1) a model-level toolkit comprising
diverse models efficiently trained on limited data and several image
manipulation functions, enabling fine-grained composition of editing actions by
the MLLM; and (2) a three-stage progressive reinforcement learning approach
that uses feedback on unannotated, open-domain instructions to train the MLLM,
equipping it with generalized reasoning capabilities for handling real-world
instructions. Experiments demonstrate that Lego-Edit achieves state-of-the-art
performance on GEdit-Bench and ImgBench. It exhibits robust reasoning
capabilities for open-domain instructions and can utilize newly introduced
editing tools without additional fine-tuning.

Motivation: Rectified Flow模型虽然生成性能优于DDIM-based扩散模型，但在实际应用中面临两个主要挑战：反演精度低导致与源图像一致性差，以及多模态注意力纠缠阻碍精确注意力控制。

Method: 1) 基于Runge-Kutta微分方程求解器的高效高阶反演方法；2) 解耦扩散变换器注意力机制(DDTA)，将文本和图像注意力在多模态扩散变换器中解耦。

Result: 在图像重建和文本引导编辑任务上的大量实验表明，该方法在保真度和可编辑性方面达到了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 提出的方法有效解决了Rectified Flow模型的两个关键挑战，显著提升了反演精度和语义控制能力，为实际应用提供了更好的解决方案。

Abstract: Rectified flow (RF) models have recently demonstrated superior generative
performance compared to DDIM-based diffusion models. However, in real-world
applications, they suffer from two major challenges: (1) low inversion accuracy
that hinders the consistency with the source image, and (2) entangled
multimodal attention in diffusion transformers, which hinders precise attention
control. To address the first challenge, we propose an efficient high-order
inversion method for rectified flow models based on the Runge-Kutta solver of
differential equations. To tackle the second challenge, we introduce Decoupled
Diffusion Transformer Attention (DDTA), a novel mechanism that disentangles
text and image attention inside the multimodal diffusion transformers, enabling
more precise semantic control. Extensive experiments on image reconstruction
and text-guided editing tasks demonstrate that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance in terms of fidelity and editability. Code is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手术三元组识别面临长尾数据分布问题，现有多任务学习方法存在任务间优化冲突（通用与特定表征纠缠）和任务内优化冲突（类别不平衡）两大挑战

Method: 1) S²D学习方案将表征分解为任务共享和任务特定组件；2) 使用MLLM构建概率提示池动态增强视觉特征；3) 通过时空维度任务提示建模任务特定线索；4) CGL策略重新平衡头尾类别的正负梯度

Conclusion: MEJO框架通过解耦表征学习和协调梯度学习，显著提升了手术三元组识别性能，为解决长尾分布下的多任务学习问题提供了有效方案

Abstract: Surgical triplet recognition, which involves identifying instrument, verb,
target, and their combinations, is a complex surgical scene understanding
challenge plagued by long-tailed data distribution. The mainstream multi-task
learning paradigm benefiting from cross-task collaborative promotion has shown
promising performance in identifying triples, but two key challenges remain: 1)
inter-task optimization conflicts caused by entangling task-generic and
task-specific representations; 2) intra-task optimization conflicts due to
class-imbalanced training data. To overcome these difficulties, we propose the
MLLM-Engaged Joint Optimization (MEJO) framework that empowers both inter- and
intra-task optimization for surgical triplet recognition. For inter-task
optimization, we introduce the Shared-Specific-Disentangled (S$^2$D) learning
scheme that decomposes representations into task-shared and task-specific
components. To enhance task-shared representations, we construct a Multimodal
Large Language Model (MLLM) powered probabilistic prompt pool to dynamically
augment visual features with expert-level semantic cues. Additionally,
comprehensive task-specific cues are modeled via distinct task prompts covering
the temporal-spatial dimensions, effectively mitigating inter-task ambiguities.
To tackle intra-task optimization conflicts, we develop a Coordinated Gradient
Learning (CGL) strategy, which dissects and rebalances the positive-negative
gradients originating from head and tail classes for more coordinated learning
behaviors. Extensive experiments on the CholecT45 and CholecT50 datasets
demonstrate the superiority of our proposed framework, validating its
effectiveness in handling optimization conflicts.

paired with navigation trajectories in photorealistic environments. We design a
comprehensive benchmark to evaluate both navigation and dialog, and conduct
extensive experiments analyzing the impact of different Navigator and Guide
models. We highlight key challenges and publicly release the dataset, code, and
evaluation framework to foster future research in embodied dialog.

TL;DR: CLVS通过跨层视觉平滑机制，在LVLMs中引入视觉记忆来维持对关键对象的持续关注，从而提升视觉理解能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型能够准确定位图像中的关键对象，但对这些对象的注意力往往很短暂。假设持续关注关键对象可以改善模型的视觉能力

Method: 提出跨层视觉平滑(CLVS)方法，包含视觉记忆来平滑注意力分布。在第一层使用位置无偏的视觉注意力初始化记忆，后续层联合考虑先前层的视觉记忆，并通过迭代更新保持对关键对象的平滑注意力。使用不确定性作为视觉理解完成的指标来终止平滑过程

Result: 在三个LVLMs的四个基准测试中验证了方法的有效性和通用性。CLVS在各种视觉理解任务上实现了最先进的性能，在关系和属性理解方面有显著改进

Conclusion: CLVS通过维持对关键对象的持续注意力，有效提升了大型视觉语言模型的视觉理解能力，特别是在关系和属性理解任务上表现突出

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) can accurately locate key objects in
images, yet their attention to these objects tends to be very brief. Motivated
by the hypothesis that sustained focus on key objects can improve LVLMs' visual
capabilities, we propose Cross-Layer Vision Smoothing (CLVS). The core idea of
CLVS is to incorporate a vision memory that smooths the attention distribution
across layers. Specifically, we initialize this vision memory with
position-unbiased visual attention in the first layer. In subsequent layers,
the model's visual attention jointly considers the vision memory from previous
layers, while the memory is updated iteratively, thereby maintaining smooth
attention on key objects. Given that visual understanding primarily occurs in
the early and middle layers of the model, we use uncertainty as an indicator of
completed visual understanding and terminate the smoothing process accordingly.
Experiments on four benchmarks across three LVLMs confirm the effectiveness and
generalizability of our method. CLVS achieves state-of-the-art performance on a
variety of visual understanding tasks, with particularly significant
improvements in relation and attribute understanding.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MSGFusion是一个基于多模态场景图引导的红外与可见光图像融合框架，通过结构化场景图显式建模实体、属性和空间关系，在多个基准测试中显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的深度学习方法主要依赖纹理、对比度等低层视觉线索，难以捕捉图像中的高层语义信息。最近尝试使用文本作为语义指导的方法依赖于非结构化描述，无法显式建模实体、属性和关系，限制了细粒度融合性能。

Method: 提出MSGFusion框架，通过深度耦合从文本和视觉中提取的结构化场景图，显式表示实体、属性和空间关系，然后通过场景图表示、分层聚合和图驱动融合等连续模块同步优化高层语义和低层细节。

Result: 在多个公共基准测试上的广泛实验表明，MSGFusion显著优于最先进的方法，特别是在细节保持和结构清晰度方面，在下游任务（如低光目标检测、语义分割和医学图像融合）中表现出优异的语义一致性和泛化能力。

Conclusion: MSGFusion通过结构化场景图引导的多模态融合方法，有效解决了现有方法在高层语义捕捉方面的局限性，为红外和可见光图像融合提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Infrared and visible image fusion has garnered considerable attention owing
to the strong complementarity of these two modalities in complex, harsh
environments. While deep learning-based fusion methods have made remarkable
advances in feature extraction, alignment, fusion, and reconstruction, they
still depend largely on low-level visual cues, such as texture and contrast,
and struggle to capture the high-level semantic information embedded in images.
Recent attempts to incorporate text as a source of semantic guidance have
relied on unstructured descriptions that neither explicitly model entities,
attributes, and relationships nor provide spatial localization, thereby
limiting fine-grained fusion performance. To overcome these challenges, we
introduce MSGFusion, a multimodal scene graph-guided fusion framework for
infrared and visible imagery. By deeply coupling structured scene graphs
derived from text and vision, MSGFusion explicitly represents entities,
attributes, and spatial relations, and then synchronously refines high-level
semantics and low-level details through successive modules for scene graph
representation, hierarchical aggregation, and graph-driven fusion. Extensive
experiments on multiple public benchmarks show that MSGFusion significantly
outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, particularly in detail preservation
and structural clarity, and delivers superior semantic consistency and
generalizability in downstream tasks such as low-light object detection,
semantic segmentation, and medical image fusion.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的生成式异常检测方法，通过图像到图像转换和补丁相似性评分，在胸部CT和脑部MRI中实现了更好的异常分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像中正常组织的细粒度变异性（如肺部解剖结构）对现有生成式异常检测方法构成挑战，需要开发能够处理这种变异性的新方法。

Method: 方法包括两个步骤：1）使用图像到图像转换进行无异常重建；2）通过观察图像与生成图像对之间的补丁相似性评分进行精确异常定位。

Result: 在胸部CT感染性病变检测和脑部MRI缺血性卒中病变分割任务中，该方法相比其他最先进的重建方法，DICE分数分别相对提高了+1.9%和+4.4%。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效处理医学图像中的正常组织变异性，在多个模态和疾病类型中都表现出优越的异常检测和分割性能。

Abstract: Early detection of newly emerging diseases, lesion severity assessment,
differentiation of medical conditions and automated screening are examples for
the wide applicability and importance of anomaly detection (AD) and
unsupervised segmentation in medicine. Normal fine-grained tissue variability
such as present in pulmonary anatomy is a major challenge for existing
generative AD methods. Here, we propose a novel generative AD approach
addressing this issue. It consists of an image-to-image translation for
anomaly-free reconstruction and a subsequent patch similarity scoring between
observed and generated image-pairs for precise anomaly localization. We
validate the new method on chest computed tomography (CT) scans for the
detection and segmentation of infectious disease lesions. To assess
generalizability, we evaluate the method on an ischemic stroke lesion
segmentation task in T1-weighted brain MRI. Results show improved pixel-level
anomaly segmentation in both chest CTs and brain MRIs, with relative DICE score
improvements of +1.9% and +4.4%, respectively, compared to other
state-of-the-art reconstruction-based methods.

TL;DR: T-SiamTPN是一个时间感知的孪生跟踪框架，通过显式时间建模解决了空中目标跟踪中的尺度变化、动态背景和遮挡问题，在保持计算效率的同时显著提升了跟踪性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有跟踪器主要关注空间线索而忽略时间依赖性，导致长期跟踪和遮挡情况下鲁棒性不足。基于相关的孪生跟踪器受限于线性相关操作的局限性，难以处理复杂的非线性外观变化。

Method: 在SiamTPN架构基础上引入显式时间建模，包含时间特征融合和基于注意力的交互机制，增强时间一致性并提供更丰富的特征表示。

Result: 相比基线方法，T-SiamTPN成功率和精度分别提升13.7%和14.7%，在Jetson Nano上以7.1 FPS实时运行，计算效率高。

Conclusion: 时间建模对孪生跟踪框架至关重要，T-SiamTPN为空中目标跟踪提供了一个强大而高效的解决方案，适用于实际嵌入式应用。

Abstract: Aerial object tracking remains a challenging task due to scale variations,
dynamic backgrounds, clutter, and frequent occlusions. While most existing
trackers emphasize spatial cues, they often overlook temporal dependencies,
resulting in limited robustness in long-term tracking and under occlusion.
Furthermore, correlation-based Siamese trackers are inherently constrained by
the linear nature of correlation operations, making them ineffective against
complex, non-linear appearance changes. To address these limitations, we
introduce T-SiamTPN, a temporal-aware Siamese tracking framework that extends
the SiamTPN architecture with explicit temporal modeling. Our approach
incorporates temporal feature fusion and attention-based interactions,
strengthening temporal consistency and enabling richer feature representations.
These enhancements yield significant improvements over the baseline and achieve
performance competitive with state-of-the-art trackers. Crucially, despite the
added temporal modules, T-SiamTPN preserves computational efficiency. Deployed
on the resource-constrained Jetson Nano, the tracker runs in real time at 7.1
FPS, demonstrating its suitability for real-world embedded applications without
notable runtime overhead. Experimental results highlight substantial gains:
compared to the baseline, T-SiamTPN improves success rate by 13.7% and
precision by 14.7%. These findings underscore the importance of temporal
modeling in Siamese tracking frameworks and establish T-SiamTPN as a strong and
efficient solution for aerial object tracking. Code is available at:

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种针对YOLOv8的三阶段压缩管道，结合稀疏感知训练、结构化通道剪枝和通道级知识蒸馏，在VisDrone数据集上实现了73.51%的参数减少和推理速度从26FPS提升到68FPS，仅损失少量检测精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在资源受限设备上部署深度学习模型进行空中目标检测需要显著的压缩而不影响性能，传统方法在压缩率和检测精度之间难以平衡。

Method: 三阶段压缩管道：1）稀疏感知训练引入动态稀疏性；2）利用批量归一化缩放因子进行结构化通道剪枝；3）使用可调节温度和损失加权的通道级知识蒸馏来恢复精度。

Result: YOLOv8m参数从25.85M减少到6.85M（减少73.51%），FLOPs从49.6G降到13.3G，MACs从101G降到34.5G，AP50仅下降2.7%，推理速度从26FPS提升到45FPS，结合TensorRT后达到68FPS。

Conclusion: 该方法在保持较高检测精度的同时显著减少了模型复杂度和计算需求，证明了在资源受限的高吞吐量场景中的实用性。

Abstract: Efficient deployment of deep learning models for aerial object detection on
resource-constrained devices requires significant compression without
com-promising performance. In this study, we propose a novel three-stage
compression pipeline for the YOLOv8 object detection model, integrating
sparsity-aware training, structured channel pruning, and Channel-Wise Knowledge
Distillation (CWD). First, sparsity-aware training introduces dynamic sparsity
during model optimization, effectively balancing parameter reduction and
detection accuracy. Second, we apply structured channel pruning by leveraging
batch normalization scaling factors to eliminate redundant channels,
significantly reducing model size and computational complexity. Finally, to
mitigate the accuracy drop caused by pruning, we employ CWD to transfer
knowledge from the original model, using an adjustable temperature and loss
weighting scheme tailored for small and medium object detection. Extensive
experiments on the VisDrone dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach across multiple YOLOv8 variants. For YOLOv8m, our method reduces model
parameters from 25.85M to 6.85M (a 73.51% reduction), FLOPs from 49.6G to
13.3G, and MACs from 101G to 34.5G, while reducing AP50 by only 2.7%. The
resulting compressed model achieves 47.9 AP50 and boosts inference speed from
26 FPS (YOLOv8m baseline) to 45 FPS, enabling real-time deployment on edge
devices. We further apply TensorRT as a lightweight optimization step. While
this introduces a minor drop in AP50 (from 47.9 to 47.6), it significantly
improves inference speed from 45 to 68 FPS, demonstrating the practicality of
our approach for high-throughput, re-source-constrained scenarios.

Motivation: 现有的点云配准质量验证方法都将其视为分类任务，只能将配准质量分配到少数几个类别中，无法提供精细的质量量化。本文希望通过回归方法实现更细粒度的配准质量评估。

Method: 使用回归方法进行点云配准质量验证，采用多尺度特征提取和基于注意力的聚合机制，扩展了之前使用的错位相关特征。

Result: 该方法在多样化数据集上实现了准确和鲁棒的配准误差估计，特别是在具有异质空间密度的点云上表现优异。在指导下游建图任务时，相比最先进的基于分类的方法，显著提高了给定重配准帧数下的建图质量。

Conclusion: 基于回归的点云配准质量验证方法相比传统分类方法能够提供更精细的质量量化，在多尺度特征和注意力机制的加持下，在各种场景下都表现出优异的性能，并能有效提升下游任务的性能。

Abstract: Point cloud registration (PCR) is crucial for many downstream tasks, such as
simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) and object tracking. This makes
detecting and quantifying registration misalignment, i.e.,~{\it PCR quality
validation}, an important task. All existing methods treat validation as a
classification task, aiming to assign the PCR quality to a few classes. In this
work, we instead use regression for PCR validation, allowing for a more
fine-grained quantification of the registration quality. We also extend
previously used misalignment-related features by using multiscale extraction
and attention-based aggregation. This leads to accurate and robust registration
error estimation on diverse datasets, especially for point clouds with
heterogeneous spatial densities. Furthermore, when used to guide a mapping
downstream task, our method significantly improves the mapping quality for a
given amount of re-registered frames, compared to the state-of-the-art
classification-based method.

Motivation: 现有的自监督3D重建方法在动态物体重建方面存在困难，主要由于运动估计不准确和时间一致性弱，导致动态场景元素的重建不完整或失真。

Method: 提出了4D雷达辅助的高斯初始化方案，利用4D雷达的速度和空间信息分割动态物体并恢复单目深度尺度；设计了速度引导的点跟踪模型(VGPT)，在场景流监督下联合训练，跟踪细粒度动态轨迹并构建时间一致的表征。

Conclusion: 4DRadar-GS通过整合4D雷达信息，有效解决了动态驾驶场景中的3D重建挑战，为自动驾驶系统的验证和感知模型训练提供了更准确的动态场景重建能力。

Abstract: 3D reconstruction and novel view synthesis are critical for validating
autonomous driving systems and training advanced perception models. Recent
self-supervised methods have gained significant attention due to their
cost-effectiveness and enhanced generalization in scenarios where annotated
bounding boxes are unavailable. However, existing approaches, which often rely
on frequency-domain decoupling or optical flow, struggle to accurately
reconstruct dynamic objects due to imprecise motion estimation and weak
temporal consistency, resulting in incomplete or distorted representations of
dynamic scene elements. To address these challenges, we propose 4DRadar-GS, a
4D Radar-augmented self-supervised 3D reconstruction framework tailored for
dynamic driving scenes. Specifically, we first present a 4D Radar-assisted
Gaussian initialization scheme that leverages 4D Radar's velocity and spatial
information to segment dynamic objects and recover monocular depth scale,
generating accurate Gaussian point representations. In addition, we propose a
Velocity-guided PointTrack (VGPT) model, which is jointly trained with the
reconstruction pipeline under scene flow supervision, to track fine-grained
dynamic trajectories and construct temporally consistent representations.
Evaluated on the OmniHD-Scenes dataset, 4DRadar-GS achieves state-of-the-art
performance in dynamic driving scene 3D reconstruction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D高斯溅射(3DGS)在实时逼真渲染方面取得显著进展，但其固有的模糊性给3D场景理解带来挑战，限制了在AR/VR和机器人领域的更广泛应用。现有方法通过2D基础模型蒸馏学习语义，但存在alpha混合平均语义的根本限制

Method: 利用预分解的对象级高斯，通过多视角CLIP特征聚合表示每个对象，创建全面的"嵌入包"来整体描述对象。绕过可微分渲染进行语义处理

Result: 实验表明该方法有效克服了3D开放词汇对象提取的挑战，同时在2D开放词汇分割方面与最先进方法性能相当

Conclusion: 该方法通过对象级语义表示和特征聚合，成功解决了3D高斯溅射的语义模糊问题，为3D场景理解提供了新的解决方案

Abstract: Novel view synthesis has seen significant advancements with 3D Gaussian
Splatting (3DGS), enabling real-time photorealistic rendering. However, the
inherent fuzziness of Gaussian Splatting presents challenges for 3D scene
understanding, restricting its broader applications in AR/VR and robotics.
While recent works attempt to learn semantics via 2D foundation model
distillation, they inherit fundamental limitations: alpha blending averages
semantics across objects, making 3D-level understanding impossible. We propose
a paradigm-shifting alternative that bypasses differentiable rendering for
semantics entirely. Our key insight is to leverage predecomposed object-level
Gaussians and represent each object through multiview CLIP feature aggregation,
creating comprehensive "bags of embeddings" that holistically describe objects.
This allows: (1) accurate open-vocabulary object retrieval by comparing text
queries to object-level (not Gaussian-level) embeddings, and (2) seamless task
adaptation: propagating object IDs to pixels for 2D segmentation or to
Gaussians for 3D extraction. Experiments demonstrate that our method
effectively overcomes the challenges of 3D open-vocabulary object extraction
while remaining comparable to state-of-the-art performance in 2D
open-vocabulary segmentation, ensuring minimal compromise.

Conclusion: TMKT方法通过时间步混合和模态感知学习目标，有效解决了跨模态知识迁移中的分布差异问题，为事件相机与脉冲神经网络的结合提供了有效的训练解决方案。

Abstract: The integration of event cameras and spiking neural networks holds great
promise for energy-efficient visual processing. However, the limited
availability of event data and the sparse nature of DVS outputs pose challenges
for effective training. Although some prior work has attempted to transfer
semantic knowledge from RGB datasets to DVS, they often overlook the
significant distribution gap between the two modalities. In this paper, we
propose Time-step Mixup knowledge transfer (TMKT), a novel fine-grained mixing
strategy that exploits the asynchronous nature of SNNs by interpolating RGB and
DVS inputs at various time-steps. To enable label mixing in cross-modal
scenarios, we further introduce modality-aware auxiliary learning objectives.
These objectives support the time-step mixup process and enhance the model's
ability to discriminate effectively across different modalities. Our approach
enables smoother knowledge transfer, alleviates modality shift during training,
and achieves superior performance in spiking image classification tasks.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method across
multiple datasets. The code will be released after the double-blind review
process.

*Robin Schön,Julian Lorenz,Katja Ludwig,Daniel Kienzle,Rainer Lienhart*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于用户点击的多模态多表面交互式分割方法，通过多模态输入和网络架构优化，显著减少了分割所需点击次数


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多表面同时存在且相互纠缠的图像分割难题，传统方法难以处理这种复杂场景，需要更有效的交互式分割方案

Method: 设计网络架构，输入包括RGB图像、非RGB模态、错误掩码和编码点击，在图像特征提取和多模态融合后整合交互信息，满足RGB骨干网黑盒和快速响应要求

Result: 在DeLiVER数据集上平均每表面减少1.28次点击(NoC@90)，在MFNet上减少1.19次点击，RGB-only基线在传统单掩码场景中也表现优异

Conclusion: 多模态融合策略有效提升了交互式分割性能，特别是在复杂多表面场景中，该方法具有实际应用价值

Abstract: In this paper, we present a method to interactively create segmentation masks
on the basis of user clicks. We pay particular attention to the segmentation of
multiple surfaces that are simultaneously present in the same image. Since
these surfaces may be heavily entangled and adjacent, we also present a novel
extended evaluation metric that accounts for the challenges of this scenario.
Additionally, the presented method is able to use multi-modal inputs to
facilitate the segmentation task. At the center of this method is a network
architecture which takes as input an RGB image, a number of non-RGB modalities,
an erroneous mask, and encoded clicks. Based on this input, the network
predicts an improved segmentation mask. We design our architecture such that it
adheres to two conditions: (1) The RGB backbone is only available as a
black-box. (2) To reduce the response time, we want our model to integrate the
interaction-specific information after the image feature extraction and the
multi-modal fusion. We refer to the overall task as Multi-Modal Multi-Surface
interactive segmentation (MMMS). We are able to show the effectiveness of our
multi-modal fusion strategy. Using additional modalities, our system reduces
the NoC@90 by up to 1.28 clicks per surface on average on DeLiVER and up to
1.19 on MFNet. On top of this, we are able to show that our RGB-only baseline
achieves competitive, and in some cases even superior performance when tested
in a classical, single-mask interactive segmentation scenario.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 历史手写文档的文本行分割面临不规则笔迹、褪色墨水和复杂布局等挑战，且缺乏大规模标注数据集，使得完全监督学习方法不实用。

Method: 通过少样本学习竞赛形式，要求参与者仅使用每份手稿的3张标注图像训练系统，在U-DIADS-TL数据集上进行文本行分割。

Result: 竞赛数据集包含多样化的古代手稿，具有各种布局、退化程度和非标准格式，真实反映实际应用场景。

Conclusion: FEST竞赛通过强调少样本学习，旨在开发鲁棒且适应性强的方法，减少人工标注需求，促进自动化文档分析工具在历史研究中的广泛应用。

Abstract: Text line segmentation is a critical step in handwritten document image
analysis. Segmenting text lines in historical handwritten documents, however,
presents unique challenges due to irregular handwriting, faded ink, and complex
layouts with overlapping lines and non-linear text flow. Furthermore, the
scarcity of large annotated datasets renders fully supervised learning
approaches impractical for such materials. To address these challenges, we
introduce the Few-Shot Text Line Segmentation of Ancient Handwritten Documents
(FEST) Competition. Participants are tasked with developing systems capable of
segmenting text lines in U-DIADS-TL dataset, using only three annotated images
per manuscript for training. The competition dataset features a diverse
collection of ancient manuscripts exhibiting a wide range of layouts,
degradation levels, and non-standard formatting, closely reflecting real-world
conditions. By emphasizing few-shot learning, FEST competition aims to promote
the development of robust and adaptable methods that can be employed by
humanities scholars with minimal manual annotation effort, thus fostering
broader adoption of automated document analysis tools in historical research.

Motivation: 评估不同蛋白质表面形状检索方法在大规模数据集上的性能，探索分子表面描述符（特别是静电势能）对检索效果的影响。

Method: 使用包含11,555个蛋白质表面的数据集，计算静电势能作为关键分子表面描述符，通过准确率、平衡准确率、F1分数、精确率和召回率等指标评估15种检索方法。

Result: 结合静电势能与分子表面形状的方法取得了最佳检索性能，即使在数据有限的类别中也表现良好，证明了额外分子表面描述符的重要性。

Conclusion: 静电势能作为分子表面描述符对蛋白质表面形状检索具有重要价值，应将其与形状信息结合使用以提高检索性能。

Abstract: This SHREC 2025 track dedicated to protein surface shape retrieval involved 9
participating teams. We evaluated the performance in retrieval of 15 proposed
methods on a large dataset of 11,555 protein surfaces with calculated
electrostatic potential (a key molecular surface descriptor). The performance
in retrieval of the proposed methods was evaluated through different metrics
(Accuracy, Balanced accuracy, F1 score, Precision and Recall). The best
retrieval performance was achieved by the proposed methods that used the
electrostatic potential complementary to molecular surface shape. This
observation was also valid for classes with limited data which highlights the
importance of taking into account additional molecular surface descriptors.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WINNER提出了一种针对SIREN网络的权重初始化方法，通过高斯噪声扰动和自适应噪声尺度来解决SIREN的频率支持限制问题，在音频、图像和3D形状拟合任务中取得了显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SIREN网络在初始化不当时会出现'频谱瓶颈'现象，当网络频率支持与目标频谱不匹配时，模型输出接近零，无法恢复其表示能力范围内的频率分量。

Method: WINNER方法对均匀初始化的SIREN权重添加高斯噪声扰动，噪声尺度根据目标信号的频谱质心自适应确定，类似于随机傅里叶嵌入但无需额外可训练参数。

Result: 该方法在音频拟合任务中达到最先进水平，在图像和3D形状拟合任务中相比基础SIREN有显著提升。

Conclusion: WINNER不仅解决了SIREN的频谱限制问题，还为深度神经网络训练的自适应、目标感知初始化策略开辟了新途径。

Abstract: We identify and address a fundamental limitation of sinusoidal representation
networks (SIRENs), a class of implicit neural representations. SIRENs Sitzmann
et al. (2020), when not initialized appropriately, can struggle at fitting
signals that fall outside their frequency support. In extreme cases, when the
network's frequency support misaligns with the target spectrum, a 'spectral
bottleneck' phenomenon is observed, where the model yields to a near-zero
output and fails to recover even the frequency components that are within its
representational capacity. To overcome this, we propose WINNER - Weight
Initialization with Noise for Neural Representations. WINNER perturbs uniformly
initialized weights of base SIREN with Gaussian noise - whose noise scales are
adaptively determined by the spectral centroid of the target signal. Similar to
random Fourier embeddings, this mitigates 'spectral bias' but without
introducing additional trainable parameters. Our method achieves
state-of-the-art audio fitting and significant gains in image and 3D shape
fitting tasks over base SIREN. Beyond signal fitting, WINNER suggests new
avenues in adaptive, target-aware initialization strategies for optimizing deep
neural network training. For code and data visit

Result: 系统梳理了全景视觉的最新突破和数据集，提出了理想的系统架构和未来路线图

Conclusion: 全景视觉在具身AI时代具有巨大潜力，但仍面临开放挑战，需要跨社区合作推动通用全景AI系统的发展

Abstract: Omnidirectional vision, using 360-degree vision to understand the
environment, has become increasingly critical across domains like robotics,
industrial inspection, and environmental monitoring. Compared to traditional
pinhole vision, omnidirectional vision provides holistic environmental
awareness, significantly enhancing the completeness of scene perception and the
reliability of decision-making. However, foundational research in this area has
historically lagged behind traditional pinhole vision. This talk presents an
emerging trend in the embodied AI era: the rapid development of omnidirectional
vision, driven by growing industrial demand and academic interest. We highlight
recent breakthroughs in omnidirectional generation, omnidirectional perception,
omnidirectional understanding, and related datasets. Drawing on insights from
both academia and industry, we propose an ideal panoramic system architecture
in the embodied AI era, PANORAMA, which consists of four key subsystems.
Moreover, we offer in-depth opinions related to emerging trends and
cross-community impacts at the intersection of panoramic vision and embodied
AI, along with the future roadmap and open challenges. This overview
synthesizes state-of-the-art advancements and outlines challenges and
opportunities for future research in building robust, general-purpose
omnidirectional AI systems in the embodied AI era.

Motivation: 解决从第一人称视角视频中检测用户动作错误的问题，特别是针对细微且不频繁的错误动作识别挑战

Abstract: In this report, we address the problem of determining whether a user performs
an action incorrectly from egocentric video data. To handle the challenges
posed by subtle and infrequent mistakes, we propose a Dual-Stage Reweighted
Mixture-of-Experts (DR-MoE) framework. In the first stage, features are
extracted using a frozen ViViT model and a LoRA-tuned ViViT model, which are
combined through a feature-level expert module. In the second stage, three
classifiers are trained with different objectives: reweighted cross-entropy to
mitigate class imbalance, AUC loss to improve ranking under skewed
distributions, and label-aware loss with sharpness-aware minimization to
enhance calibration and generalization. Their predictions are fused using a
classification-level expert module. The proposed method achieves strong
performance, particularly in identifying rare and ambiguous mistake instances.

*Yue Zhou,Xinan He,Kaiqing Lin,Bing Fan,Feng Ding,Jinhua Zeng,Bin Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 使用现代视觉基础模型(VFM)的简单线性分类器在AI生成图像检测任务上显著优于专用检测器，在真实场景中准确率提升超过20%。研究发现VFM的强大性能源于其对合成图像与伪造相关概念的文本-图像对齐能力，而这种能力依赖于预训练数据的时间范围。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的专用AI生成图像检测器在精心策划的基准测试上表现良好，但在真实场景中失败率极高，假阴性率严重。研究者希望找到更有效的解决方案来应对真实世界中的AI生成图像检测挑战。

Method: 采用现代视觉基础模型(VFM)上的简单线性分类器作为基线方法，通过分析文本-图像相似性来探究VFM学习到的表示能力，并创建了在VFM预训练截止日期后收集的新数据集来验证数据暴露的影响。

Result: 在相同数据上训练，基于VFM的线性分类器显著超越专用检测器，在真实场景基准测试中将准确率提高了超过20%。研究发现近期VLM学会了将合成图像与伪造相关概念对齐，但这种能力严重依赖于预训练数据的时间范围。

Conclusion: 1) 对于真实世界的AI生成图像检测，更新后的VFM原始"火力"远比静态检测器的"工艺"更有效；2) 真正的泛化评估要求测试数据独立于模型的整个训练历史，包括预训练阶段。

Abstract: While specialized detectors for AI-generated images excel on curated
benchmarks, they fail catastrophically in real-world scenarios, as evidenced by
their critically high false-negative rates on `in-the-wild' benchmarks. Instead
of crafting another specialized `knife' for this problem, we bring a `gun' to
the fight: a simple linear classifier on a modern Vision Foundation Model
(VFM). Trained on identical data, this baseline decisively `outguns' bespoke
detectors, boosting in-the-wild accuracy by a striking margin of over 20\%.
  Our analysis pinpoints the source of the VFM's `firepower': First, by probing
text-image similarities, we find that recent VLMs (e.g., Perception Encoder,
Meta CLIP2) have learned to align synthetic images with forgery-related
concepts (e.g., `AI-generated'), unlike previous versions. Second, we speculate
that this is due to data exposure, as both this alignment and overall accuracy
plummet on a novel dataset scraped after the VFM's pre-training cut-off date,
ensuring it was unseen during pre-training. Our findings yield two critical
conclusions: 1) For the real-world `gunfight' of AI-generated image detection,
the raw `firepower' of an updated VFM is far more effective than the
`craftsmanship' of a static detector. 2) True generalization evaluation
requires test data to be independent of the model's entire training history,
including pre-training.

Conclusion: 小型低功耗设计便于在争议区域或缺乏电力基础设施的地点部署，为无人机检测提供了高效的神经形态解决方案

Abstract: Small drones are an increasing threat to both military personnel and civilian
infrastructure, making early and automated detection crucial. In this work we
develop a system that uses spiking neural networks and neuromorphic cameras
(event cameras) to detect drones. The detection model is deployed on a
neuromorphic chip making this a fully neuromorphic system. Multiple detection
units can be deployed to create a virtual tripwire which detects when and where
drones enter a restricted zone. We show that our neuromorphic solution is
several orders of magnitude more energy efficient than a reference solution
deployed on an edge GPU, allowing the system to run for over a year on battery
power. We investigate how synthetically generated data can be used for
training, and show that our model most likely relies on the shape of the drone
rather than the temporal characteristics of its propellers. The small size and
low power consumption allows easy deployment in contested areas or locations
that lack power infrastructure.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单图像3D头像重建任务由于单目输入信息有限，在生成过程中难以控制遮挡区域的几何和纹理，存在根本性的不适定性问题

Method: 两阶段框架：第一阶段使用轻量级适配器增强的多视图生成模型（包含Pose-Adapter和ID-Adapter-G），第二阶段使用前馈Transformer模型重建3D高斯溅射表示，并引入ID-Adapter-R融合面部特征

Conclusion: Dream3DAvatar通过创新的适配器设计和两阶段流程，有效解决了单图像3D头像重建中的遮挡区域控制挑战，实现了高质量的文本可控生成

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of 3D representation techniques and generative
models, substantial progress has been made in reconstructing full-body 3D
avatars from a single image. However, this task remains fundamentally
ill-posedness due to the limited information available from monocular input,
making it difficult to control the geometry and texture of occluded regions
during generation. To address these challenges, we redesign the reconstruction
pipeline and propose Dream3DAvatar, an efficient and text-controllable
two-stage framework for 3D avatar generation. In the first stage, we develop a
lightweight, adapter-enhanced multi-view generation model. Specifically, we
introduce the Pose-Adapter to inject SMPL-X renderings and skeletal information
into SDXL, enforcing geometric and pose consistency across views. To preserve
facial identity, we incorporate ID-Adapter-G, which injects high-resolution
facial features into the generation process. Additionally, we leverage BLIP2 to
generate high-quality textual descriptions of the multi-view images, enhancing
text-driven controllability in occluded regions. In the second stage, we design
a feedforward Transformer model equipped with a multi-view feature fusion
module to reconstruct high-fidelity 3D Gaussian Splat representations (3DGS)
from the generated images. Furthermore, we introduce ID-Adapter-R, which
utilizes a gating mechanism to effectively fuse facial features into the
reconstruction process, improving high-frequency detail recovery. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our method can generate realistic, animation-ready
3D avatars without any post-processing and consistently outperforms existing
baselines across multiple evaluation metrics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的RL方法直接从LLMs移植到VLMs效果不佳，因为VLMs需要先准确感知和理解视觉输入才能进行有效推理，任务更加复杂。

Method: 采用两阶段强化学习框架：第一阶段通过粗粒度和细粒度视觉理解提升视觉感知能力；第二阶段专注于增强推理能力。使用数据集级采样来缓解RL训练中的优势消失问题。

Conclusion: 提出的两阶段RL框架成功提升了VLMs的感知和推理能力，为复杂视觉语言任务提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has proven highly effective in eliciting the
reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Inspired by this
success, recent studies have explored applying similar techniques to
vision-language models (VLMs), aiming to enhance their reasoning performance.
However, directly transplanting RL methods from LLMs to VLMs is suboptimal, as
the tasks faced by VLMs are inherently more complex. Specifically, VLMs must
first accurately perceive and understand visual inputs before reasoning can be
effectively performed. To address this challenge, we propose a two-stage
reinforcement learning framework designed to jointly enhance both the
perceptual and reasoning capabilities of VLMs. To mitigate the vanishing
advantage issue commonly observed in RL training, we first perform
dataset-level sampling to selectively strengthen specific capabilities using
distinct data sources. During training, the first stage focuses on improving
the model's visual perception through coarse- and fine-grained visual
understanding, while the second stage targets the enhancement of reasoning
abilities. After the proposed two-stage reinforcement learning process, we
obtain PeBR-R1, a vision-language model with significantly enhanced perceptual
and reasoning capabilities. Experimental results on seven benchmark datasets
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and validate the superior
performance of PeBR-R1 across diverse visual reasoning tasks.

TL;DR: HERO是一个无需训练的高分辨率视觉语言模型高效推理框架，通过内容自适应token预算分配和功能感知token选择，在保持精度的同时显著减少计算和内存开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高分辨率大视觉语言模型(HR-LVLMs)通过将高分辨率图像裁剪成局部图块独立编码，获得了卓越的细粒度视觉理解能力，但这种分治范式显著增加了视觉token数量，导致计算和内存开销大幅增加。

Method: 基于三个关键发现：(1)局部图块重要性不同，由视觉显著性和任务相关性共同决定；(2)CLIP视觉编码器中CLS token在不同层呈现两阶段注意力模式；(3)不同阶段强调的视觉token编码不同粒度的信息。提出HERO框架，集成内容自适应token预算分配和功能感知token选择。

Result: HERO在多样化基准测试和模型规模上实现了优越的效率-精度权衡，所有操作无需训练。

Conclusion: 该研究为HR-LVLMs的高效推理提供了实证见解和实用解决方案，通过选择性保留具有互补作用的视觉token来优化性能。

Abstract: By cropping high-resolution images into local tiles and encoding them
independently, High-Resolution Large Vision-Language Models (HR-LVLMs) have
demonstrated remarkable fine-grained visual understanding capabilities.
However, this divide-and-conquer paradigm significantly increases the number of
visual tokens, resulting in substantial computational and memory overhead. To
better understand and address this challenge, we empirically investigate visual
token utilization in HR-LVLMs and uncover three key findings: (1) the local
tiles have varying importance, jointly determined by visual saliency and task
relevance; (2) the CLS token in CLIP-based vision encoders exhibits a two-stage
attention pattern across layers, with each stage attending to different types
of visual tokens; (3) the visual tokens emphasized at different stages encode
information at varying levels of granularity, playing complementary roles
within LVLMs. Building on these insights, we propose HERO, a High-resolution
visual token early dropping framework that integrates content-adaptive token
budget allocation with function-aware token selection. By accurately estimating
tile-level importance and selectively retaining visual tokens with
complementary roles, HERO achieves superior efficiency-accuracy trade-offs
across diverse benchmarks and model scales, all in a training-free manner. This
study provides both empirical insights and practical solutions toward efficient
inference in HR-LVLMs.

Motivation: 现有的指代图像分割方法在多模态对齐和语言语义损失方面存在困难，特别是在包含多个视觉相似对象的复杂场景中，经常出现目标定位错误或不完整分割的问题。

Conclusion: TFANet通过分层三阶段框架有效解决了指代图像分割中的多模态对齐挑战，特别是在复杂包含多个视觉相似对象的场景中表现出更好的分割准确性。

Abstract: Referring Image Segmentation (RIS) is a task that segments image regions
based on language expressions, requiring fine-grained alignment between two
modalities. However, existing methods often struggle with multimodal
misalignment and language semantic loss, especially in complex scenes
containing multiple visually similar objects, where uniquely described targets
are frequently mislocalized or incompletely segmented. To tackle these
challenges, this paper proposes TFANet, a Three-stage Image-Text Feature
Alignment Network that systematically enhances multimodal alignment through a
hierarchical framework comprising three stages: Knowledge Plus Stage (KPS),
Knowledge Fusion Stage (KFS), and Knowledge Intensification Stage (KIS). In the
first stage, we design the Multiscale Linear Cross-Attention Module (MLAM),
which facilitates bidirectional semantic exchange between visual features and
textual representations across multiple scales. This establishes rich and
efficient alignment between image regions and different granularities of
linguistic descriptions. Subsequently, the KFS further strengthens feature
alignment through the Cross-modal Feature Scanning Module (CFSM), which applies
multimodal selective scanning to capture long-range dependencies and construct
a unified multimodal representation. This is essential for modeling long-range
cross-modal dependencies and enhancing alignment accuracy in complex scenes.
Finally, in the KIS, we propose the Word-level Linguistic Feature-guided
Semantic Deepening Module (WFDM) to compensate for semantic degradation
introduced in earlier stages.

Result: 在多个基准测试中，LLFDisc在定性和定量评估方面均达到最先进的性能表现。

Conclusion: LLFDisc通过创新的分布感知损失和频率感知增强架构，能够更鲁棒地对齐傅里叶域信息，优于传统的基于MSE的损失方法。

Abstract: In the Fourier domain, luminance information is primarily encoded in the
amplitude spectrum, while spatial structures are captured in the phase
components. The traditional Fourier Frequency information fitting employs
pixel-wise loss functions, which tend to focus excessively on local information
and may lead to global information loss. In this paper, we present LLFDisc, a
U-shaped deep enhancement network that integrates cross-attention and gating
mechanisms tailored for frequency-aware enhancement. We propose a novel
distribution-aware loss that directly fits the Fourier-domain information and
minimizes their divergence using a closed-form KL-Divergence objective. This
enables the model to align Fourier-domain information more robustly than with
conventional MSE-based losses. Furthermore, we enhance the perceptual loss
based on VGG by embedding KL-Divergence on extracted deep features, enabling
better structural fidelity. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks
demonstrate that LLFDisc achieves state-of-the-art performance in both
qualitative and quantitative evaluations. Our code will be released at:

Conclusion: 提出的框架有效解决了半监督医学图像分割中的伪标签噪声和特征监督不足问题，通过模块化设计显著提升了分割性能

Abstract: Despite the remarkable performance of supervised medical image segmentation
models, relying on a large amount of labeled data is impractical in real-world
situations. Semi-supervised learning approaches aim to alleviate this challenge
using unlabeled data through pseudo-label generation. Yet, existing
semi-supervised segmentation methods still suffer from noisy pseudo-labels and
insufficient supervision within the feature space. To solve these challenges,
this paper proposes a novel semi-supervised 3D medical image segmentation
framework based on a dual-network architecture. Specifically, we investigate a
Cross Consistency Enhancement module using both cross pseudo and
entropy-filtered supervision to reduce the noisy pseudo-labels, while we design
a dynamic weighting strategy to adjust the contributions of pseudo-labels using
an uncertainty-aware mechanism (i.e., Kullback-Leibler divergence). In
addition, we use a self-supervised contrastive learning mechanism to align
uncertain voxel features with reliable class prototypes by effectively
differentiating between trustworthy and uncertain predictions, thus reducing
prediction uncertainty. Extensive experiments are conducted on three 3D
segmentation datasets, Left Atrial, NIH Pancreas and BraTS-2019. The proposed
approach consistently exhibits superior performance across various settings
(e.g., 89.95\% Dice score on left Atrial with 10\% labeled data) compared to
the state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, the usefulness of the proposed
modules is further validated via ablation experiments.

Abstract: Quality control of assembly processes is essential in manufacturing to ensure
not only the quality of individual components but also their proper integration
into the final product. To assist in this matter, automated assembly control
using computer vision methods has been widely implemented. However, the costs
associated with image acquisition, annotation, and training of computer vision
algorithms pose challenges for integration, especially for small- and
medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), which often lack the resources for extensive
training, data collection, and manual image annotation. Synthetic data offers
the potential to reduce manual data collection and labeling. Nevertheless, its
practical application in the context of assembly quality remains limited. In
this work, we present a novel approach for easily integrable and data-efficient
visual assembly control. Our approach leverages simulated scene generation
based on computer-aided design (CAD) data and object detection algorithms. The
results demonstrate a time-saving pipeline for generating image data in
manufacturing environments, achieving a mean Average Precision (mAP@0.5:0.95)
up to 99,5% for correctly identifying instances of synthetic planetary gear
system components within our simulated training data, and up to 93% when
transferred to real-world camera-captured testing data. This research
highlights the effectiveness of synthetic data generation within an adaptable
pipeline and underscores its potential to support SMEs in implementing
resource-efficient visual assembly control solutions.

<details>

Conclusion: 通过利用前景/背景或非地面/地面线索，可以有效减少运动预测的标注需求，同时保持良好性能，为自动驾驶运动理解提供了实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Understanding motion in dynamic environments is critical for autonomous
driving, thereby motivating research on class-agnostic motion prediction. In
this work, we investigate weakly and self-supervised class-agnostic motion
prediction from LiDAR point clouds. Outdoor scenes typically consist of mobile
foregrounds and static backgrounds, allowing motion understanding to be
associated with scene parsing. Based on this observation, we propose a novel
weakly supervised paradigm that replaces motion annotations with fully or
partially annotated (1%, 0.1%) foreground/background masks for supervision. To
this end, we develop a weakly supervised approach utilizing
foreground/background cues to guide the self-supervised learning of motion
prediction models. Since foreground motion generally occurs in non-ground
regions, non-ground/ground masks can serve as an alternative to
foreground/background masks, further reducing annotation effort. Leveraging
non-ground/ground cues, we propose two additional approaches: a weakly
supervised method requiring fewer (0.01%) foreground/background annotations,
and a self-supervised method without annotations. Furthermore, we design a
Robust Consistency-aware Chamfer Distance loss that incorporates multi-frame
information and robust penalty functions to suppress outliers in
self-supervised learning. Experiments show that our weakly and self-supervised
models outperform existing self-supervised counterparts, and our weakly
supervised models even rival some supervised ones. This demonstrates that our
approaches effectively balance annotation effort and performance.

Abstract: As automatic parking systems evolve, the accurate detection of parking slots
has become increasingly critical. This study focuses on parking slot detection
using surround-view cameras, which offer a comprehensive bird's-eye view of the
parking environment. However, the current datasets are limited in scale, and
the scenes they contain are seldom disrupted by real-world noise (e.g., light,
occlusion, etc.). Moreover, manual data annotation is prone to errors and
omissions due to the complexity of real-world conditions, significantly
increasing the cost of annotating large-scale datasets. To address these
issues, we first construct a large-scale parking slot detection dataset (named
CRPS-D), which includes various lighting distributions, diverse weather
conditions, and challenging parking slot variants. Compared with existing
datasets, the proposed dataset boasts the largest data scale and consists of a
higher density of parking slots, particularly featuring more slanted parking
slots. Additionally, we develop a semi-supervised baseline for parking slot
detection, termed SS-PSD, to further improve performance by exploiting
unlabeled data. To our knowledge, this is the first semi-supervised approach in
parking slot detection, which is built on the teacher-student model with
confidence-guided mask consistency and adaptive feature perturbation.
Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of SS-PSD over the existing
state-of-the-art (SoTA) solutions on both the proposed dataset and the existing
dataset. Particularly, the more unlabeled data there is, the more significant
the gains brought by our semi-supervised scheme. The relevant source codes and
the dataset have been made publicly available at

Conclusion: MSDNet通过多阶段蒸馏有效解决了4D雷达点云超分辨率的精度-效率权衡问题，具有实际应用价值

Abstract: 4D radar super-resolution, which aims to reconstruct sparse and noisy point
clouds into dense and geometrically consistent representations, is a
foundational problem in autonomous perception. However, existing methods often
suffer from high training cost or rely on complex diffusion-based sampling,
resulting in high inference latency and poor generalization, making it
difficult to balance accuracy and efficiency. To address these limitations, we
propose MSDNet, a multi-stage distillation framework that efficiently transfers
dense LiDAR priors to 4D radar features to achieve both high reconstruction
quality and computational efficiency. The first stage performs
reconstruction-guided feature distillation, aligning and densifying the
student's features through feature reconstruction. In the second stage, we
propose diffusion-guided feature distillation, which treats the stage-one
distilled features as a noisy version of the teacher's representations and
refines them via a lightweight diffusion network. Furthermore, we introduce a
noise adapter that adaptively aligns the noise level of the feature with a
predefined diffusion timestep, enabling a more precise denoising. Extensive
experiments on the VoD and in-house datasets demonstrate that MSDNet achieves
both high-fidelity reconstruction and low-latency inference in the task of 4D
radar point cloud super-resolution, and consistently improves performance on
downstream tasks. The code will be publicly available upon publication.

Conclusion: 该多视频协作框架为解决视频语言模型的时空不完整性问题提供了有效解决方案，有望推动视频语言模型的进一步发展

Abstract: Despite the prosperity of the video language model, the current pursuit of
comprehensive video reasoning is thwarted by the inherent spatio-temporal
incompleteness within individual videos, resulting in hallucinations and
inaccuracies. A promising solution is to augment the reasoning performance with
multiple related videos. However, video tokens are numerous and contain
redundant information, so directly feeding the relevant video data into a large
language model to enhance responses could be counterproductive. To address this
challenge, we propose a multi-video collaborative framework for video language
models. For efficient and flexible video representation, we establish a Video
Structuring Module to represent the video's knowledge as a spatio-temporal
graph. Based on the structured video representation, we design the Graph Fusion
Module to fuse the structured knowledge and valuable information from related
videos into the augmented graph node tokens. Finally, we construct an elaborate
multi-video structured prompt to integrate the graph, visual, and textual
tokens as the input to the large language model. Extensive experiments
substantiate the effectiveness of our framework, showcasing its potential as a
promising avenue for advancing video language models.

Abstract: Street trees are vital to urban livability, providing ecological and social
benefits. Establishing a detailed, accurate, and dynamically updated street
tree inventory has become essential for optimizing these multifunctional assets
within space-constrained urban environments. Given that traditional field
surveys are time-consuming and labor-intensive, automated surveys utilizing
Mobile Mapping Systems (MMS) offer a more efficient solution. However, existing
MMS-acquired tree datasets are limited by small-scale scene, limited
annotation, or single modality, restricting their utility for comprehensive
analysis. To address these limitations, we introduce WHU-STree, a cross-city,
richly annotated, and multi-modal urban street tree dataset. Collected across
two distinct cities, WHU-STree integrates synchronized point clouds and
high-resolution images, encompassing 21,007 annotated tree instances across 50
species and 2 morphological parameters. Leveraging the unique characteristics,
WHU-STree concurrently supports over 10 tasks related to street tree inventory.
We benchmark representative baselines for two key tasks--tree species
classification and individual tree segmentation. Extensive experiments and
in-depth analysis demonstrate the significant potential of multi-modal data
fusion and underscore cross-domain applicability as a critical prerequisite for
practical algorithm deployment. In particular, we identify key challenges and
outline potential future works for fully exploiting WHU-STree, encompassing
multi-modal fusion, multi-task collaboration, cross-domain generalization,
spatial pattern learning, and Multi-modal Large Language Model for street tree
asset management. The WHU-STree dataset is accessible at:

Abstract: The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) presents unprecedented
opportunities to revolutionize medical contrastive vision-language
pre-training. In this paper, we show how LLMs can facilitate large-scale
supervised pre-training, thereby advancing vision-language alignment. We begin
by demonstrate that modern LLMs can automatically extract diagnostic labels
from radiology reports with remarkable precision (>96\% AUC in our experiments)
without complex prompt engineering, enabling the creation of large-scale
"silver-standard" datasets at a minimal cost (~\$3 for 50k CT image-report
pairs). Further, we find that vision encoder trained on this "silver-standard"
dataset achieves performance comparable to those trained on labels extracted by
specialized BERT-based models, thereby democratizing the access to large-scale
supervised pre-training. Building on this foundation, we proceed to reveal that
supervised pre-training fundamentally improves contrastive vision-language
alignment. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance using only a 3D
ResNet-18 with vanilla CLIP training, including 83.8\% AUC for zero-shot
diagnosis on CT-RATE, 77.3\% AUC on RAD-ChestCT, and substantial improvements
in cross-modal retrieval (MAP@50=53.7\% for image-image, Recall@100=52.2\% for
report-image). These results demonstrate the potential of utilizing LLMs to
facilitate {\bf more performant and scalable} medical AI systems. Our code is

Abstract: With the growing deployment of autonomous driving agents, the detection and
segmentation of road obstacles have become critical to ensure safe autonomous
navigation. However, existing road-obstacle segmentation methods are applied on
individual frames, overlooking the temporal nature of the problem, leading to
inconsistent prediction maps between consecutive frames. In this work, we
demonstrate that the road-obstacle segmentation task is inherently temporal,
since the segmentation maps for consecutive frames are strongly correlated. To
address this, we curate and adapt four evaluation benchmarks for road-obstacle
video segmentation and evaluate 11 state-of-the-art image- and video-based
segmentation methods on these benchmarks. Moreover, we introduce two strong
baseline methods based on vision foundation models. Our approach establishes a
new state-of-the-art in road-obstacle video segmentation for long-range video

Abstract: The powerful generative capabilities of diffusion models have significantly
advanced the field of image synthesis, enhancing both full image generation and
inpainting-based image editing. Despite their remarkable advancements,
diffusion models also raise concerns about potential misuse for malicious
purposes. However, existing approaches struggle to identify images generated by
diffusion-based inpainting models, even when similar inpainted images are
included in their training data. To address this challenge, we propose a novel
detection method based on End-to-end denoising diffusion (End4). Specifically,
End4 designs a denoising reconstruction model to improve the alignment degree
between the latent spaces of the reconstruction and detection processes, thus
reconstructing features that are more conducive to detection. Meanwhile, it
leverages a Scale-aware Pyramid-like Fusion Module (SPFM) that refines local
image features under the guidance of attention pyramid layers at different
scales, enhancing feature discriminability. Additionally, to evaluate detection
performance on inpainted images, we establish a comprehensive benchmark
comprising images generated from five distinct masked regions. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that our End4 effectively generalizes to unseen masking
patterns and remains robust under various perturbations. Our code and dataset
will be released soon.

*Hugo Carlesso,Josiane Mothe,Radu Tudor Ionescu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的课程多任务自监督学习框架(CMTSSL)，用于高光谱图像的轻量级架构分析，通过掩码图像建模和空间光谱拼图解谜相结合，在四个基准数据集上取得了显著的下游分割性能提升


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高光谱成像数据维度高且卫星数据传输速率慢，需要轻量高效的模型支持星上处理，减少冗余或低价值数据的传输

Method: 整合掩码图像建模与解耦的空间和光谱拼图解谜，采用课程学习策略在自监督过程中逐步增加数据复杂度，使编码器能够联合捕获细粒度光谱连续性、空间结构和全局语义特征

Result: 在四个公共基准数据集上验证，使用比最先进模型轻16000倍以上的架构，在下游分割任务中取得了一致的性能提升

Conclusion: CMTSSL在轻量级架构的通用表示学习方面具有巨大潜力，特别适合星上卫星部署的实际高光谱应用

Abstract: Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) captures detailed spectral signatures across
hundreds of contiguous bands per pixel, being indispensable for remote sensing
applications such as land-cover classification, change detection, and
environmental monitoring. Due to the high dimensionality of HSI data and the
slow rate of data transfer in satellite-based systems, compact and efficient
models are required to support onboard processing and minimize the transmission
of redundant or low-value data, e.g. cloud-covered areas. To this end, we
introduce a novel curriculum multi-task self-supervised learning (CMTSSL)
framework designed for lightweight architectures for HSI analysis. CMTSSL
integrates masked image modeling with decoupled spatial and spectral jigsaw
puzzle solving, guided by a curriculum learning strategy that progressively
increases data complexity during self-supervision. This enables the encoder to
jointly capture fine-grained spectral continuity, spatial structure, and global
semantic features. Unlike prior dual-task SSL methods, CMTSSL simultaneously
addresses spatial and spectral reasoning within a unified and computationally
efficient design, being particularly suitable for training lightweight models
for onboard satellite deployment. We validate our approach on four public
benchmark datasets, demonstrating consistent gains in downstream segmentation
tasks, using architectures that are over 16,000x lighter than some
state-of-the-art models. These results highlight the potential of CMTSSL in
generalizable representation learning with lightweight architectures for
real-world HSI applications. Our code is publicly available at

TL;DR: RadGame是一个AI驱动的游戏化放射学教育平台，通过定位异常和生成报告两个核心游戏模块，结合大规模公共数据集和AI自动反馈，显著提升放射学培训效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统放射学培训主要依赖被动案例学习或需要放射科医生实时指导，缺乏即时、可扩展的反馈机制。RadGame旨在通过AI驱动的游戏化平台填补这一空白，为学习者提供结构化、自动化的反馈。

Method: 平台包含两个核心模块：RadGame Localize（玩家绘制异常边界框，与放射科医生标注对比，视觉语言模型生成错漏解释）和RadGame Report（玩家撰写报告，基于放射学报告生成指标提供结构化AI反馈，对比真实报告给出评分）。

Result: 前瞻性评估显示，使用RadGame的参与者在定位准确率上比传统被动方法提升68%（vs 17%），在报告写作准确率上提升31%（vs 4%）。

Conclusion: RadGame展示了AI驱动游戏化在提供可扩展、反馈丰富的放射学培训方面的潜力，重新构想了医疗AI资源在教育中的应用方式。

Abstract: We introduce RadGame, an AI-powered gamified platform for radiology education
that targets two core skills: localizing findings and generating reports.
Traditional radiology training is based on passive exposure to cases or active
practice with real-time input from supervising radiologists, limiting
opportunities for immediate and scalable feedback. RadGame addresses this gap
by combining gamification with large-scale public datasets and automated,
AI-driven feedback that provides clear, structured guidance to human learners.
In RadGame Localize, players draw bounding boxes around abnormalities, which
are automatically compared to radiologist-drawn annotations from public
datasets, and visual explanations are generated by vision-language models for
user missed findings. In RadGame Report, players compose findings given a chest
X-ray, patient age and indication, and receive structured AI feedback based on
radiology report generation metrics, highlighting errors and omissions compared
to a radiologist's written ground truth report from public datasets, producing
a final performance and style score. In a prospective evaluation, participants
using RadGame achieved a 68% improvement in localization accuracy compared to
17% with traditional passive methods and a 31% improvement in report-writing
accuracy compared to 4% with traditional methods after seeing the same cases.
RadGame highlights the potential of AI-driven gamification to deliver scalable,
feedback-rich radiology training and reimagines the application of medical AI
resources in education.

Abstract: A reliable method of quantifying the perceptual realness of AI-generated

accomplishes both overall objective realness assessment and local inconsistency
identification of AI-generated images using textual descriptions of visual
inconsistencies generated by vision-language models trained on large datasets
that serve as reliable substitutes for human annotations. Our results
demonstrate that the proposed multimodal approach improves objective realness
prediction performance and produces dense realness maps that effectively
distinguish between realistic and unrealistic spatial regions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在视频游戏和虚拟现实等应用中，需要创建与现有资产风格一致的3D资产，但现有的3D生成方法难以实现精确的风格控制。

Method: 提出Style Disentangled Attention模块，通过跨3D注意力机制实现内容与风格图像的动态交互，并引入风格解耦特征选择策略来防止语义内容泄漏。

Result: 实验表明，StyleSculptor在生成高质量3D资产方面优于现有基线方法，能够实现纹理、几何或两者的精确风格控制。

Conclusion: 该方法为零样本风格引导的3D生成提供了有效的解决方案，具有细粒度控制和风格强度调节能力。

Abstract: Creating 3D assets that follow the texture and geometry style of existing
ones is often desirable or even inevitable in practical applications like video
gaming and virtual reality. While impressive progress has been made in
generating 3D objects from text or images, creating style-controllable 3D
assets remains a complex and challenging problem. In this work, we propose
StyleSculptor, a novel training-free approach for generating style-guided 3D
assets from a content image and one or more style images. Unlike previous
works, StyleSculptor achieves style-guided 3D generation in a zero-shot manner,
enabling fine-grained 3D style control that captures the texture, geometry, or
both styles of user-provided style images. At the core of StyleSculptor is a
novel Style Disentangled Attention (SD-Attn) module, which establishes a
dynamic interaction between the input content image and style image for
style-guided 3D asset generation via a cross-3D attention mechanism, enabling
stable feature fusion and effective style-guided generation. To alleviate
semantic content leakage, we also introduce a style-disentangled feature
selection strategy within the SD-Attn module, which leverages the variance of
3D feature patches to disentangle style- and content-significant channels,
allowing selective feature injection within the attention framework. With
SD-Attn, the network can dynamically compute texture-, geometry-, or
both-guided features to steer the 3D generation process. Built upon this, we
further propose the Style Guided Control (SGC) mechanism, which enables
exclusive geometry- or texture-only stylization, as well as adjustable style
intensity control. Extensive experiments demonstrate that StyleSculptor
outperforms existing baseline methods in producing high-fidelity 3D assets.

Motivation: 为了解决2D和3D数据之间的鸿沟，让用户能够通过简单的2D标注（如边界框、分割掩码）来实现3D空间理解，而无需复杂的多帧标注或3D传感器输入。

Method: 通过用3D位置嵌入丰富2D视觉特征，使3D模型能够利用强大的2D先验知识进行跨帧的精确空间推理，即使目标对象不在同一视图中出现。

Result: 在通用2D视觉语言和专门3D空间基准测试中达到最先进性能，证明其在统一2D和3D表示空间方面的有效性，且适用于无3D输入或标注的野外视频。

Conclusion: SR-3D成功建立了2D和3D之间的桥梁，实现了灵活的区域提示和准确的空间关系推断，为场景理解提供了有效的统一表示框架。

Abstract: We present Spatial Region 3D (SR-3D) aware vision-language model that
connects single-view 2D images and multi-view 3D data through a shared visual
token space. SR-3D supports flexible region prompting, allowing users to
annotate regions with bounding boxes, segmentation masks on any frame, or
directly in 3D, without the need for exhaustive multi-frame labeling. We
achieve this by enriching 2D visual features with 3D positional embeddings,
which allows the 3D model to draw upon strong 2D priors for more accurate
spatial reasoning across frames, even when objects of interest do not co-occur
within the same view. Extensive experiments on both general 2D vision language
and specialized 3D spatial benchmarks demonstrate that SR-3D achieves
state-of-the-art performance, underscoring its effectiveness for unifying 2D
and 3D representation space on scene understanding. Moreover, we observe
applicability to in-the-wild videos without sensory 3D inputs or ground-truth
3D annotations, where SR-3D accurately infers spatial relationships and metric
measurements.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: KGTB提出了一种基于知识图谱的tokenization方法，通过多行为学习来解决生成式POI推荐中的信息丢失和行为理解不足问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有生成式POI推荐方法存在两个局限：(1) tokenizer难以编码推荐数据中的异构信号，导致信息丢失；(2) 指令调优任务只关注POI访问行为，忽略其他行为类型，对移动性理解不足

Method: 使用知识图谱格式组织推荐数据，开发基于KG的tokenizer将节点量化为结构ID，通过多行为学习引入多个行为特定的预测任务进行LLM微调

Result: 在四个真实城市数据集上的实验证明了KGTB的优越性能

Conclusion: KGTB通过知识图谱tokenization和多行为学习，有效解决了生成式POI推荐中的信息异构性和行为理解不足问题，取得了显著性能提升

Abstract: Generative paradigm, especially powered by Large Language Models (LLMs), has
emerged as a new solution to the next point-of-interest (POI) recommendation.
Pioneering studies usually adopt a two-stage pipeline, starting with a
tokenizer converting POIs into discrete identifiers that can be processed by
LLMs, followed by POI behavior prediction tasks to instruction-tune LLM for
next POI recommendation. Despite of remarkable progress, they still face two
limitations: (1) existing tokenizers struggle to encode heterogeneous signals
in the recommendation data, suffering from information loss issue, and (2)
previous instruction-tuning tasks only focus on users' POI visit behavior while
ignore other behavior types, resulting in insufficient understanding of
mobility. To address these limitations, we propose KGTB (Knowledge Graph
Tokenization for Behavior-aware generative next POI recommendation).
Specifically, KGTB organizes the recommendation data in a knowledge graph (KG)
format, of which the structure can seamlessly preserve the heterogeneous
information. Then, a KG-based tokenizer is developed to quantize each node into
an individual structural ID. This process is supervised by the KG's structure,
thus reducing the loss of heterogeneous information. Using generated IDs, KGTB
proposes multi-behavior learning that introduces multiple behavior-specific
prediction tasks for LLM fine-tuning, e.g., POI, category, and region visit
behaviors. Learning on these behavior tasks provides LLMs with comprehensive
insights on the target POI visit behavior. Experiments on four real-world city
datasets demonstrate the superior performance of KGTB.

TL;DR: LEAF是一个轻量级的知识蒸馏框架，用于文本嵌入模型，能够将小型学生模型与大型教师模型对齐，支持信息检索中的非对称架构，并在BEIR和MTEB基准测试中达到同规模模型的最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决文本嵌入模型在信息检索等应用中需要高效部署的需求，同时保持模型性能，作者提出了一个轻量级的蒸馏框架，使学生模型能够继承教师模型的优秀特性。

Method: 使用知识蒸馏技术，通过LEAF框架将小型学生模型（leaf模型）与大型教师模型对齐，支持非对称架构（文档用教师模型编码，查询用学生模型处理），且不需要显式训练即可继承MRL和输出量化鲁棒性等特性。

Result: 提出的leaf-ir模型（2300万参数）在BEIR基准测试中达到同规模模型的SOTA性能，排名第一；在非对称模式下检索性能进一步提升。leaf-mt模型也在MTEB v2（英语）排行榜上达到同规模模型的SOTA。

Conclusion: LEAF框架是一个高效且通用的文本嵌入模型蒸馏方法，适用于黑盒模型，不需要人工标注或困难负样本，训练资源需求低，在多个基准测试中证明了其有效性。

Abstract: We present LEAF ("Lightweight Embedding Alignment Framework"), a knowledge
distillation framework for text embedding models. A key distinguishing feature
is that our distilled leaf models are aligned to their teacher. In the context
of information retrieval, this allows for flexible asymmetric architectures
where documents are encoded with the larger teacher model, while queries can be
served with the smaller leaf models. We also show that leaf models
automatically inherit MRL and robustness to output quantization whenever these
properties are present in the teacher model, without explicitly training for
them. To demonstrate the capability of our framework we publish leaf-ir, a 23M
parameters information retrieval oriented text embedding model trained using
LEAF, which sets a new state-of-the-art (SOTA) on BEIR, ranking #1 on the
public leaderboard for this benchmark and for models of its size. When run in
asymmetric mode, its retrieval performance is further increased. Our scheme is
however not restricted to the information retrieval setting, and we demonstrate
its wider applicability by synthesizing the multi-task leaf-mt model. This also
sets a new SOTA, ranking #1 on the public MTEB v2 (English) leaderboard for its
size. LEAF is applicable to black-box models and in contrast to other embedding
model training frameworks, it does not require judgments nor hard negatives,
and training can be conducted using small batch sizes. Thus, dataset and
training infrastructure requirements for our framework are modest. We make our
models publicly available under a permissive Apache 2.0 license.

TL;DR: 本文提出了Document Information Gain (DIG)指标来量化检索文档对答案生成的贡献度，并基于此开发了InfoGain-RAG框架，通过训练专门的reranker来筛选最有价值的文档，显著提升了RAG系统的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前RAG框架难以识别检索到的文档是否真正有助于答案生成，无法有效过滤无关或误导性内容，这显著影响了最终性能。

Method: 提出DIG指标，通过计算LLM在有文档增强和无文档增强时的生成置信度差异来量化文档价值；基于DIG分数训练专门的reranker，从精确区分和准确排序两个角度对检索文档进行优先级排序。

Result: 在多个模型和基准测试中，InfoGain-RAG显著优于现有方法。在NaturalQA上，相比朴素RAG、自反思RAG和现代基于排序的RAG，准确率分别提升17.9%、4.5%和12.5%；在GPT-4o上平均提升15.3%。

Conclusion: InfoGain-RAG为RAG提供了可靠的解决方案，在多个应用中具有可行性，能够有效过滤无关文档并选择最有价值的文档来生成更好的答案。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as a promising approach to
address key limitations of Large Language Models (LLMs), such as hallucination,
outdated knowledge, and lacking reference. However, current RAG frameworks
often struggle with identifying whether retrieved documents meaningfully
contribute to answer generation. This shortcoming makes it difficult to filter
out irrelevant or even misleading content, which notably impacts the final
performance. In this paper, we propose Document Information Gain (DIG), a novel
metric designed to quantify the contribution of retrieved documents to correct
answer generation. DIG measures a document's value by computing the difference
of LLM's generation confidence with and without the document augmented.
Further, we introduce InfoGain-RAG, a framework that leverages DIG scores to
train a specialized reranker, which prioritizes each retrieved document from
exact distinguishing and accurate sorting perspectives. This approach can
effectively filter out irrelevant documents and select the most valuable ones
for better answer generation. Extensive experiments across various models and
benchmarks demonstrate that InfoGain-RAG can significantly outperform existing
approaches, on both single and multiple retrievers paradigm. Specifically on
NaturalQA, it achieves the improvements of 17.9%, 4.5%, 12.5% in exact match
accuracy against naive RAG, self-reflective RAG and modern ranking-based RAG
respectively, and even an average of 15.3% increment on advanced proprietary
model GPT-4o across all datasets. These results demonstrate the feasibility of
InfoGain-RAG as it can offer a reliable solution for RAG in multiple
applications.

Motivation: 现有深度哈希模型的针对性攻击方法存在多模态指导缺乏、依赖标签信息和像素级操作等问题，需要更有效的攻击方案

Method: 使用扩散模型优化图像潜在表示，通过LLM生成目标图像的文本信息作为指导，设计多空间哈希对齐网络将高维图像和文本空间映射到低维二进制哈希空间，并采用文本引导注意力机制精炼对抗样本

Result: 实验表明该方法在针对性攻击效果上优于现有SOTA方法，具有更好的黑盒迁移性和跨数据集稳定性

Conclusion: DiffHash通过多模态指导和潜在空间优化，为深度哈希模型的安全漏洞提供了有效的针对性攻击解决方案

Abstract: Deep hashing models have been widely adopted to tackle the challenges of
large-scale image retrieval. However, these approaches face serious security
risks due to their vulnerability to adversarial examples. Despite the
increasing exploration of targeted attacks on deep hashing models, existing
approaches still suffer from a lack of multimodal guidance, reliance on
labeling information and dependence on pixel-level operations for attacks. To
address these limitations, we proposed DiffHash, a novel diffusion-based
targeted attack for deep hashing. Unlike traditional pixel-based attacks that
directly modify specific pixels and lack multimodal guidance, our approach
focuses on optimizing the latent representations of images, guided by text
information generated by a Large Language Model (LLM) for the target image.
Furthermore, we designed a multi-space hash alignment network to align the
high-dimension image space and text space to the low-dimension binary hash
space. During reconstruction, we also incorporated text-guided attention
mechanisms to refine adversarial examples, ensuring them aligned with the
target semantics while maintaining visual plausibility. Extensive experiments
have demonstrated that our method outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) targeted
attack methods, achieving better black-box transferability and offering more
excellent stability across datasets.

Result: 在多个公共数据集上的实验结果表明，FIT模型显著优于现有的最先进预排序基线模型。

Conclusion: FIT模型成功解决了传统双塔模型信息交互不足的问题，在保持推理效率的同时显著提升了预排序性能，为大规模推荐系统的预排序阶段提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Pre-ranking plays a crucial role in large-scale recommender systems by
significantly improving the efficiency and scalability within the constraints
of providing high-quality candidate sets in real time. The two-tower model is
widely used in pre-ranking systems due to a good balance between efficiency and
effectiveness with decoupled architecture, which independently processes user
and item inputs before calculating their interaction (e.g. dot product or
similarity measure). However, this independence also leads to the lack of
information interaction between the two towers, resulting in less
effectiveness. In this paper, a novel architecture named learnable Fully
Interacted Two-tower Model (FIT) is proposed, which enables rich information
interactions while ensuring inference efficiency. FIT mainly consists of two
parts: Meta Query Module (MQM) and Lightweight Similarity Scorer (LSS).
Specifically, MQM introduces a learnable item meta matrix to achieve expressive
early interaction between user and item features. Moreover, LSS is designed to
further obtain effective late interaction between the user and item towers.
Finally, experimental results on several public datasets show that our proposed
FIT significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art baseline pre-ranking models.

mobility and summarize how individuals move between geographical regions. These
regions should be small enough to be representative of user mobility, without
incurring substantial privacy risks. There are two added values of the
NetMob2025 challenge dataset. Firstly, the data is extensive and contains a lot
of socio-demographic information that can be used to create multiple OD
matrices, based on the segments of the population. Secondly, a participant is
not merely a record in the data, but a statistically weighted proxy for a
segment of the real population. This opens the door to a fundamental shift in
the anonymization paradigm. A population-based view of privacy is central to
our contribution. By adjusting our anonymization framework to account for
representativeness, we are also protecting the inferred identity of the actual
population, rather than survey participants alone. The challenge addressed in
this work is to produce and compare OD matrices that are k-anonymous for survey
participants and for the whole population. We compare several traditional
methods of anonymization to k-anonymity by generalizing geographical areas.
These include generalization over a hierarchy (ATG and OIGH) and the classical
Mondrian. To this established toolkit, we add a novel method, i.e., ODkAnon, a
greedy algorithm aiming at balancing speed and quality. Unlike previous
approaches, which primarily address the privacy aspects of the given datasets,
we aim to contribute to the generation of privacy-preserving OD matrices
enriched with socio-demographic segmentation that achieves k-anonymity on the
actual population.

Motivation: 随着全球变暖加剧，需要评估和减少推荐系统的环境影响，但推荐系统社区对此缺乏认识和评估

Method: 复制2013和2023年ACM RecSys会议的79篇论文实验流程，使用硬件能量计测量能耗并转换为CO2当量，比较传统AI模型和深度学习模型

Result: 使用深度学习模型的论文排放约42倍于传统模型的CO2当量，平均单篇深度学习论文产生2909公斤CO2当量

Conclusion: 推荐系统和机器学习社区急需采用绿色AI原则，在算法进步和环境责任之间取得平衡，构建可持续的AI个性化未来

Abstract: As global warming soars, the need to assess and reduce the environmental
impact of recommender systems is becoming increasingly urgent. Despite this,
the recommender systems community hardly understands, addresses, and evaluates
the environmental impact of their work. In this study, we examine the
environmental impact of recommender systems research by reproducing typical
experimental pipelines. Based on our results, we provide guidelines for
researchers and practitioners on how to minimize the environmental footprint of
their work and implement green recommender systems - recommender systems
designed to minimize their energy consumption and carbon footprint. Our
analysis covers 79 papers from the 2013 and 2023 ACM RecSys conferences,
comparing traditional "good old-fashioned AI" models with modern deep learning
models. We designed and reproduced representative experimental pipelines for
both years, measuring energy consumption using a hardware energy meter and
converting it into CO2 equivalents. Our results show that papers utilizing deep
learning models emit approximately 42 times more CO2 equivalents than papers
using traditional models. On average, a single deep learning-based paper
generates 2,909 kilograms of CO2 equivalents - more than the carbon emissions
of a person flying from New York City to Melbourne or the amount of CO2
sequestered by one tree over 260 years. This work underscores the urgent need
for the recommender systems and wider machine learning communities to adopt
green AI principles, balancing algorithmic advancements and environmental
responsibility to build a sustainable future with AI-powered personalization.

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 提出基于BPE分词和预训练LLM嵌入的冷启动推荐方法，使用细粒度词元级向量作为语义先验，在零样本设置下实现即时推荐，无需用户-物品交互历史。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决推荐系统中的冷启动问题，特别是在新用户或新物品缺乏历史交互数据时，传统基于内容或混合方法在稀疏元数据环境中只能捕捉浅层模式。

Method: 应用Byte Pair Encoding (BPE)分词和预训练大语言模型(LLM)嵌入，获得与BPE词汇表对齐的细粒度词元级向量，作为未见实体的密集语义先验。

Result: 在基准数据集上的实验显示，BPE-LLM方法在Recall@k、NDCG@k和Hit Rate指标上优于标准基线，具有更好的泛化性和可解释性，计算性能充足。

Conclusion: 词元级语义初始化可作为轻量级但有效的扩展，应用于现代推荐系统的零样本冷启动场景，在多语言和稀疏输入环境下表现优异。

Abstract: The cold-start issue is the challenge when we talk about recommender systems,
especially in the case when we do not have the past interaction data of new
users or new items. Content-based features or hybrid solutions are common as
conventional solutions, but they can only work in a sparse metadata environment
with shallow patterns. In this paper, the efficient cold-start recommendation
strategy is presented, which is based on the sub word-level representations by
applying Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) tokenization and pre-trained Large Language
Model (LLM) embedding in the initialization procedure. We obtain fine-grained
token-level vectors that are aligned with the BPE vocabulary as opposed to
using coarse-grained sentence embeddings. Together, these token embeddings can
be used as dense semantic priors on unseen entities, making immediate
recommendation performance possible without user-item interaction history. Our
mechanism can be compared to collaborative filtering systems and tested over
benchmark datasets with stringent cold-start assumptions. Experimental findings
show that the given BPE-LLM method achieves higher Recall@k, NDCG@k, and Hit
Rate measurements compared to the standard baseline and displays the same
capability of sufficient computational performance. Furthermore, we demonstrate
that using subword-aware embeddings yields better generalizability and is more
interpretable, especially within a multilingual and sparse input setting. The
practical application of token-level semantic initialization as a lightweight,
but nevertheless effective extension to modern recommender systems in the
zero-shot setting is indicated within this work.

*Sriram Nagaraj,Vishakh Hari*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了非局部神经正切核（NNTK），通过用参数空间中的非局部相互作用近似替代局部梯度，扩展了NTK理论到非光滑函数和更广泛模型类别。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统神经正切核（NTK）框架依赖于网络对参数可微的假设，这一假设在处理非光滑目标函数或表现出不可微行为的参数化模型时会失效。

Method: 提出非局部神经正切核（NNTK），使用非局部梯度替代标准梯度，探索了固定核和基于注意力的非局部算子公式，并通过数值研究进行验证。

Result: NNTK允许将NTK理论扩展到非光滑函数、随机估计器和更广泛的模型族，突破了传统可微性限制。

Conclusion: 非局部神经正切核为分析非光滑神经网络训练动力学提供了新的理论框架，扩展了NTK的应用范围。

Abstract: The Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) framework has provided deep insights into the
training dynamics of neural networks under gradient flow. However, it relies on
the assumption that the network is differentiable with respect to its
parameters, an assumption that breaks down when considering non-smooth target
functions or parameterized models exhibiting non-differentiable behavior. In
this work, we propose a Nonlocal Neural Tangent Kernel (NNTK) that replaces the
local gradient with a nonlocal interaction-based approximation in parameter
space. Nonlocal gradients are known to exist for a wider class of functions
than the standard gradient. This allows NTK theory to be extended to nonsmooth
functions, stochastic estimators, and broader families of models. We explore
both fixed-kernel and attention-based formulations of this nonlocal operator.
We illustrate the new formulation with numerical studies.

TL;DR: PowerGrow是一个用于生成电力系统测试案例的协同生成框架，通过依赖分解和分层图扩散过程，在保持操作有效性的同时显著降低计算开销。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代电力系统日益动态化，但公开测试案例稀缺，需要能够联合生成电网结构和节点动态的生成工具，同时保持物理可行性和避免过高计算成本。

Method: 采用依赖分解方法，将复杂联合分布分解为可行电网拓扑、时间序列总线负载等的条件分布链，使用分层图beta扩散过程进行结构合成，配合时间自编码器嵌入时间序列数据。

Result: 实验显示PowerGrow在保真度和多样性上优于先前的扩散模型，达到98.9%的潮流收敛率和改进的N-1事故恢复能力。

Conclusion: PowerGrow能够生成操作有效且现实的电网场景，为动态电力系统研究提供了实用的测试案例生成工具。

Abstract: Modern power systems are becoming increasingly dynamic, with changing
topologies and time-varying loads driven by renewable energy variability,
electric vehicle adoption, and active grid reconfiguration. Despite these
changes, publicly available test cases remain scarce, due to security concerns
and the significant effort required to anonymize real systems. Such limitations
call for generative tools that can jointly synthesize grid structure and nodal
dynamics. However, modeling the joint distribution of network topology, branch
attributes, bus properties, and dynamic load profiles remains a major
challenge, while preserving physical feasibility and avoiding prohibitive
computational costs. We present PowerGrow, a co-generative framework that
significantly reduces computational overhead while maintaining operational
validity. The core idea is dependence decomposition: the complex joint
distribution is factorized into a chain of conditional distributions over
feasible grid topologies, time-series bus loads, and other system attributes,
leveraging their mutual dependencies. By constraining the generation process at
each stage, we implement a hierarchical graph beta-diffusion process for
structural synthesis, paired with a temporal autoencoder that embeds
time-series data into a compact latent space, improving both training stability
and sample fidelity. Experiments across benchmark settings show that PowerGrow
not only outperforms prior diffusion models in fidelity and diversity but also
achieves a 98.9\% power flow convergence rate and improved N-1 contingency
resilience. This demonstrates its ability to generate operationally valid and
realistic power grid scenarios.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管去中心化学习在理论上被广泛探索，但由于在大规模DNN训练中缺乏稳定性、可扩展性和通用性，尚未在生产环境中广泛应用。本研究旨在探索去中心化学习在生产环境中的实际应用。

Method: 引入DBench基准测试框架，包含中心化和去中心化DNN训练；提出基准测试方法分析模型精度与参数张量方差的相关性；基于观察结果提出Ada方法，在去中心化SGD训练中动态调整通信图。

Result: 发现去中心化训练存在可扩展性和通用性问题；模型精度与通信图连接数相关；对参数张量方差异常敏感；Ada方法在1008个GPU上训练ResNet50时，收敛速度最佳，模型精度与中心化学习相当。

Conclusion: Ada方法通过动态调整通信图，成功解决了大规模去中心化DNN训练的关键挑战，证明了去中心化学习在生产环境中的可行性，为实际应用提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Although it has been extensively explored in theory, decentralized learning
is not yet green-lighted for production use, largely due to a lack of
stability, scalability, and generality in large scale DNN training. To shed
light on the production use of decentralized learning, this work studies
decentralized data parallel training at scale. To this end, we introduce a
benchmarking framework, namely DBench, to host both centralized and
decentralized DNN training. Building upon DBench, we introduce a benchmarking
methodology to uncover the correlations between model accuracy and the
variances of parameter tensors by varying communication graphs and training
scales. Based on the benchmarking results, we observe that, (1) Similar to
centralized learning, decentralized data parallel training also presents the
issues of scalability and generality when the training scales up; (2) The model
accuracy of decentralized learning is correlated to the number of connections
in a communication graph; (3) The model accuracy of decentralized learning is
surprisingly sensitive to the variance of parameter tensors across model
replicas. Built upon the observations, we propose Ada, a decentralized adaptive
approach that performs large scale DNN training following a decentralized SGD
method and adapting the communication graph in use dynamically throughout
training iterations. We apply Ada on large scale training and observe that Ada
can obtain the best convergence rates consistently in decentralized DNN
training, and delivers equally or comparably good model accuracy for all sample
applications as centralized learning does, even when training ResNet50 for
ImageNet-1K on the scale of 1008 GPUs.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: MEUV框架通过主题对齐的互斥解锁向量，实现了细粒度的安全控制，在保持高攻击成功率的同时显著减少跨主题泄漏，为安全敏感领域的LLM部署提供了新方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM安全对齐机制会同时拒绝恶意请求和合法的高风险场景请求，而之前的单一解锁向量方法缺乏语义控制，会无差别解锁所有危险主题。

Method: 提出互斥解锁向量(MEUV)框架，将单一拒绝方向分解为多个主题对齐、近乎正交的向量，通过多任务目标在单个epoch中学习，包含差分消融边界、跨主题惩罚、正交性惩罚等辅助项。

Result: 在双语恶意提示基准测试中，MEUV在多个模型上达到不低于87%的攻击成功率，同时相比最佳单向量基线减少高达90%的跨主题泄漏，且中英文向量具有良好迁移性。

Conclusion: MEUV证明了通过最小效用损失实现细粒度主题级能力激活的可行性，为安全敏感领域的可控LLM部署铺平了道路。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) enforce safety alignment to reliably refuse
malicious requests, yet the same blanket safeguards also block legitimate uses
in policing, defense, and other high-stakes settings. Earlier
"refusal-direction" edits can bypass those layers, but they rely on a single
vector that indiscriminately unlocks all hazardous topics, offering no semantic
control. We introduce Mutually Exclusive Unlock Vectors (MEUV), a lightweight
framework that factorizes the monolithic refusal direction into topic-aligned,
nearly orthogonal vectors, each dedicated to one sensitive capability. MEUV is
learned in a single epoch with a multi-task objective that blends a
differential-ablation margin, cross-topic and orthogonality penalties, and
several auxiliary terms. On bilingual malicious-prompt benchmarks, MEUV
achieves an attack success rate of no less than 87% on Gemma-2-2B, LLaMA-3-8B,
and Qwen-7B, yet cuts cross-topic leakage by up to 90% compared with the best
single-direction baseline. Vectors trained in Chinese transfer almost unchanged
to English (and vice versa), suggesting a language-agnostic refusal subspace.
The results show that fine-grained, topic-level capability activation is
achievable with minimal utility loss, paving the way for controlled LLMs
deployment in security-sensitive domains.

Motivation: 大规模低轨卫星系统支持广域数据交换和AI协同训练，但隐私约束限制原始数据集中处理，联邦学习成为替代方案。然而卫星网络的动态拓扑和有限带宽阻碍参数及时聚合，导致训练时间延长

Method: 采用离散时间图基础的按需调度框架，动态分配通信资源来加速联邦学习过程

Result: 相比传统统计复用策略，将整体轮次时间减少14.20%至41.48%，且模型越大、客户端越多，加速效果越明显

Conclusion: 所提出的调度框架具有良好可扩展性，能有效解决卫星网络中联邦学习的通信瓶颈问题

Abstract: Large-scale low-Earth-orbit (LEO) satellite systems are increasingly valued
for their ability to enable rapid and wide-area data exchange, thereby
facilitating the collaborative training of artificial intelligence (AI) models
across geographically distributed regions. Due to privacy concerns and
regulatory constraints, raw data collected at remote clients cannot be
centrally aggregated, posing a major obstacle to traditional AI training
methods. Federated learning offers a privacy-preserving alternative by training
local models on distributed devices and exchanging only model parameters.
However, the dynamic topology and limited bandwidth of satellite systems will
hinder timely parameter aggregation and distribution, resulting in prolonged
training times. To address this challenge, we investigate the problem of
scheduling federated learning over satellite networks and identify key
bottlenecks that impact the overall duration of each training round. We propose
a discrete temporal graph-based on-demand scheduling framework that dynamically
allocates communication resources to accelerate federated learning. Simulation
results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves significant performance
gains over traditional statistical multiplexing-based model exchange
strategies, reducing overall round times by 14.20% to 41.48%. Moreover, the
acceleration effect becomes more pronounced for larger models and higher
numbers of clients, highlighting the scalability of the proposed approach.

TL;DR: TripOptimizer是一个完全可微分的深度学习框架，用于从车辆点云数据直接进行快速气动分析和形状优化，通过变分自编码器和三平面隐式神经表示实现高保真3D几何重建和阻力系数预测。

Result: 优化设计实现了高达11.8%的阻力系数降低，结果通过超过1.5亿个网格单元的高保真CFD模拟验证。隐式表示对几何缺陷具有鲁棒性，能够优化非水密网格。

Conclusion: 该框架实现了更敏捷的气动形状优化工作流程，减少了对计算密集型CFD模拟的依赖，特别适用于早期设计阶段。

Abstract: The computational cost of traditional Computational Fluid Dynamics-based
Aerodynamic Shape Optimization severely restricts design space exploration.
This paper introduces TripOptimizer, a fully differentiable deep learning
framework for rapid aerodynamic analysis and shape optimization directly from
vehicle point cloud data. TripOptimizer employs a Variational Autoencoder
featuring a triplane-based implicit neural representation for high-fidelity 3D
geometry reconstruction and a drag coefficient prediction head. Trained on
DrivAerNet++, a large-scale dataset of 8,000 unique vehicle geometries with
corresponding drag coefficients computed via Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes
simulations, the model learns a latent representation that encodes
aerodynamically salient geometric features. We propose an optimization strategy
that modifies a subset of the encoder parameters to steer an initial geometry
towards a target drag value, and demonstrate its efficacy in case studies where
optimized designs achieved drag coefficient reductions up to 11.8\%. These
results were subsequently validated by using independent, high-fidelity
Computational Fluid Dynamics simulations with more than 150 million cells. A
key advantage of the implicit representation is its inherent robustness to
geometric imperfections, enabling optimization of non-watertight meshes, a
significant challenge for traditional adjoint-based methods. The framework
enables a more agile Aerodynamic Shape Optimization workflow, reducing reliance
on computationally intensive CFD simulations, especially during early design
stages.

Abstract: This work introduces a physics-informed neural networks (PINNs)-based model
predictive control (MPC) framework for susceptible-infected-recovered ($SIR$)
spreading models. Existing studies in MPC design for epidemic control often
assume either 1) measurable states of the dynamics, where the parameters are
learned, or 2) known parameters of the model, where the states are learned. In
this work, we address the joint real-time estimation of states and parameters
within the MPC framework using only noisy infected states, under the assumption
that 1) only the recovery rate is known, or 2) only the basic reproduction
number is known. Under the first assumption, we propose MPC-PINNs and two novel
PINNs algorithms, all of which are integrated into the MPC framework. First, we
introduce MPC-PINNs, which are designed for $SIR$ models with control. We then
propose log-scaled PINNs (MPC-LS-PINNs), which incorporate a log-scaled loss
function to improve robustness against noise. Next, we present split-integral
PINNs (MPC-SI-PINNs), which leverage integral operators and state coupling in
the neural network training process to effectively reconstruct the complete
epidemic state information. Building upon these methods, we further extend our
framework for the second assumption. We establish the necessary conditions and
extend our PINNs algorithms, where MPC-SI-PINNs are simplified as split-PINNs
(MPC-S-PINNs). By incorporating these algorithms into the MPC framework, we
simultaneously estimate the epidemic states and parameters while generating
optimal control strategies. Experiment results demonstrate the effectiveness of
the proposed methods under different settings.

Abstract: We propose a unified framework for adaptive routing in multitask, multimodal
prediction settings where data heterogeneity and task interactions vary across
samples. Motivated by applications in psychotherapy where structured
assessments and unstructured clinician notes coexist with partially missing
data and correlated outcomes, we introduce a routing-based architecture that
dynamically selects modality processing pathways and task-sharing strategies on
a per-sample basis. Our model defines multiple modality paths, including raw
and fused representations of text and numeric features and learns to route each
input through the most informative expert combination. Task-specific
predictions are produced by shared or independent heads depending on the
routing decision, and the entire system is trained end-to-end. We evaluate the
model on both synthetic data and real-world psychotherapy notes predicting
depression and anxiety outcomes. Our experiments show that our method
consistently outperforms fixed multitask or single-task baselines, and that the
learned routing policy provides interpretable insights into modality relevance
and task structure. This addresses critical challenges in personalized
healthcare by enabling per-subject adaptive information processing that
accounts for data heterogeneity and task correlations. Applied to
psychotherapy, this framework could improve mental health outcomes, enhance
treatment assignment precision, and increase clinical cost-effectiveness
through personalized intervention strategies.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然LoRA和QLoRA等参数高效微调技术使得在有限硬件上微调大语言模型成为可能，但在消费级GPU（特别是8GB显存限制下）的训练效率仍缺乏系统研究。

Method: 使用Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct模型在NVIDIA RTX 4060上进行控制性性能分析，系统变化批次大小、序列长度、优化器选择（AdamW vs PagedAdamW）和精度（fp16 vs bf16），测量吞吐量、处理时间和显存占用。

Result: 分页优化器相比基线提升25%吞吐量（628 tok/s vs 500 tok/s），bf16效率低于fp16，在8GB显存限制下可实现最长2048 tokens的序列长度。

Conclusion: 这是首个在消费级GPU上系统研究LLM微调效率的案例研究，为资源受限的研究者和实践者提供了可复现的基准测试和实用指南。

Abstract: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) with parameter-efficient techniques
such as LoRA and QLoRA has enabled adaptation of foundation models on modest
hardware. Yet the efficiency of such training on consumer-grade GPUs,
especially under strict 8 GB VRAM limits, remains underexplored. We present a
controlled profiling study of LoRA/QLoRA fine-tuning using the
Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct model on a single NVIDIA RTX 4060. Across three
representative configurations, we systematically vary batch size, sequence
length, optimizer choice (AdamW vs. PagedAdamW), and precision (fp16 vs. bf16).
We report throughput (tokens/s), time per 10k tokens, and VRAM footprint,
alongside energy estimates derived from GPU board power limits. Our results
show that paged optimizers improve throughput by up to 25% (628 tok/s vs. 500
tok/s baseline), while bf16 degrades efficiency relative to fp16. Despite 8 GB
constraints, sequence lengths up to 2048 tokens were feasible using
parameter-efficient strategies. To our knowledge, this is the first systematic
case study of LLM fine-tuning efficiency on consumer GPUs, providing
reproducible benchmarks and practical guidelines for resource-constrained
researchers and practitioners.

Conclusion: PerM-MoE方法能够有效应对临床实践中常见的多模态数据缺失问题，提升阿尔茨海默病认知衰退预测的准确性

Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disease with high
inter-patient variance in rate of cognitive decline. AD progression prediction
aims to forecast patient cognitive decline and benefits from incorporating
multiple neuroimaging modalities. However, existing multimodal models fail to
make accurate predictions when many modalities are missing during inference, as
is often the case in clinical settings. To increase multimodal model
flexibility under high modality missingness, we introduce PerM-MoE, a novel
sparse mixture-of-experts method that uses independent routers for each
modality in place of the conventional, single router. Using T1-weighted MRI,
FLAIR, amyloid beta PET, and tau PET neuroimaging data from the Alzheimer's
Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI), we evaluate PerM-MoE, state-of-the-art
Flex-MoE, and unimodal neuroimaging models on predicting two-year change in
Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB) scores under varying levels of
modality missingness. PerM-MoE outperforms the state of the art in most
variations of modality missingness and demonstrates more effective utility of

Motivation: 解决短视频环境中用户行为预测和推荐策略优化的挑战，传统模型在复杂时序关系建模方面存在不足

Method: 提出MT-DQN模型，集成Transformer、时序图神经网络(TGNN)和深度Q网络(DQN)，用于建模用户行为时序依赖和优化推荐策略

Result: 相比传统拼接模型平均F1-score提升10.97%，NDCG@5提升8.3%；相比经典Vanilla-DQN模型，MSE降低34.8%，MAE降低26.5%

Conclusion: MT-DQN在推荐性能上显著优于基线模型，但存在计算成本和在线推理延迟问题，需要通过未来架构优化来解决

Abstract: This paper proposes the MT-DQN model, which integrates a Transformer,
Temporal Graph Neural Network (TGNN), and Deep Q-Network (DQN) to address the
challenges of predicting user behavior and optimizing recommendation strategies
in short-video environments. Experiments demonstrated that MT-DQN consistently
outperforms traditional concatenated models, such as Concat-Modal, achieving an
average F1-score improvement of 10.97% and an average NDCG@5 improvement of
8.3%. Compared to the classic reinforcement learning model Vanilla-DQN, MT-DQN
reduces MSE by 34.8% and MAE by 26.5%. Nonetheless, we also recognize
challenges in deploying MT-DQN in real-world scenarios, such as its
computational cost and latency sensitivity during online inference, which will
be addressed through future architectural optimization.

TL;DR: 研究发现SFT-RL两阶段微调中，SFT早期OOD性能最佳但随后下降，RL阶段主要作用是恢复SFT中丢失的OOD能力而非创造新能力，关键机制是奇异向量的旋转而非奇异值变化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索SFT和RL两阶段微调范式中性能提升的机制，验证"SFT记忆、RL泛化"说法的准确性，理解OOD性能变化的根本原因。

Method: 使用SVD分析参数矩阵，手动编辑参数并观察性能影响，分析不同训练阶段奇异值和奇异向量的变化规律。

Result: 发现OOD性能在SFT早期达到峰值后下降；RL主要恢复SFT丢失的OOD能力而非创造新能力；奇异向量旋转是影响OOD行为的关键因素，奇异值相对稳定。

Conclusion: 重新定义了SFT和RL在两阶段微调中的角色，发现奇异向量旋转是影响模型OOD性能的关键机制，为理解微调过程提供了新视角。

Abstract: The two-stage fine-tuning paradigm of Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) followed
by Reinforcement Learning (RL) has empirically shown better reasoning
performance than one-stage SFT for the post-training of Large Language Models
(LLMs). However, the evolution and mechanism behind the synergy of SFT and RL
are still under-explored and inconclusive. In our study, we find the well-known
claim "SFT memorizes, RL generalizes" is over-simplified, and discover that:
(1) OOD performance peaks at the early stage of SFT and then declines (OOD
forgetting), the best SFT checkpoint cannot be captured by training/test loss;
(2) the subsequent RL stage does not generate fundamentally better OOD
capability, instead it plays an \textbf{OOD restoration} role, recovering the
lost reasoning ability during SFT; (3) The recovery ability has boundaries,
\ie{} \textbf{if SFT trains for too short or too long, RL cannot recover the
lost OOD ability;} (4) To uncover the underlying mechanisms behind the
forgetting and restoration process, we employ SVD analysis on parameter
matrices, manually edit them, and observe their impacts on model performance.
Unlike the common belief that the shift of model capacity mainly results from
the changes of singular values, we find that they are actually quite stable
throughout fine-tuning. Instead, the OOD behavior strongly correlates with the
\textbf{rotation of singular vectors}. Our findings re-identify the roles of
SFT and RL in the two-stage fine-tuning and discover the rotation of singular
vectors as the key mechanism. %reversing the rotations induced by SFT, which
shows recovery from forgetting, whereas imposing the SFT parameter directions
onto a RL-tuned model results in performance degradation. Code is available at

TL;DR: 提出基于微分同胚嵌入神经算子的新框架NDNO，用于高效预测不同几何形状结构件的加工变形，通过将复杂几何映射到统一参考域来解决传统方法计算成本高的问题。

Motivation: 结构件加工变形预测对保证尺寸精度至关重要，但传统数值方法在处理不同几何形状时计算成本高昂，神经算子虽能高效求解偏微分方程，但在变化几何域中直接应用存在理论限制。

Method: 使用微分同胚神经网络将复杂三维几何映射到统一参考域，保持光滑性和可逆性约束，然后在参考域上训练神经算子学习残余应力引起的变形场。

Result: 方法能够准确预测主方向和多方向变形场，在不同几何形状（包括组件类型、尺寸和特征）的零件上实现了高精度和高效率。

Conclusion: NDNO框架为变化几何形状结构件的变形预测提供了有效且计算高效的解决方案，实现了快速适应不同几何形状的能力。

Abstract: Accurate prediction of machining deformation in structural components is
essential for ensuring dimensional precision and reliability. Such deformation
often originates from residual stress fields, whose distribution and influence
vary significantly with geometric complexity. Conventional numerical methods
for modeling the coupling between residual stresses and deformation are
computationally expensive, particularly when diverse geometries are considered.
Neural operators have recently emerged as a powerful paradigm for efficiently
solving partial differential equations, offering notable advantages in
accelerating residual stress-deformation analysis. However, their direct
application across changing geometric domains faces theoretical and practical
limitations. To address this challenge, a novel framework based on
diffeomorphic embedding neural operators named neural diffeomorphic-neural
operator (NDNO) is introduced. Complex three-dimensional geometries are
explicitly mapped to a common reference domain through a diffeomorphic neural
network constrained by smoothness and invertibility. The neural operator is
then trained on this reference domain, enabling efficient learning of
deformation fields induced by residual stresses. Once trained, both the
diffeomorphic neural network and the neural operator demonstrate efficient
prediction capabilities, allowing rapid adaptation to varying geometries. The
proposed method thus provides an effective and computationally efficient
solution for deformation prediction in structural components subject to varying
geometries. The proposed method is validated to predict both main-direction and
multi-direction deformation fields, achieving high accuracy and efficiency
across parts with diverse geometries including component types, dimensions and
features.

TL;DR: 基于改进关联规则挖掘方法分析滤泡性甲状腺癌临床数据，发现结节内结节模式、小梁模式、低TSH评分等新恶性关联指标


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 滤泡性甲状腺癌缺乏特异性超声征象，术前诊断困难，相关临床研究较少，需要新的数据分析方法来识别有助于术前诊断的临床指征

Method: 改进传统关联规则挖掘方法，结合可解释机器学习SHAP思想，提出新的分析指标来反映临床指征与癌症之间的恶性关联

Result: 分析1673个病例节点，发现除了不规则边界、不均匀晕环等常见指标外，结节内结节模式、小梁模式、低TSH评分等也具有强恶性关联，Hashimoto甲状腺炎组合也有强关联性

Conclusion: 滤泡性甲状腺癌术前诊断应考虑多个临床指征，本研究发现的多样化恶性关联可为临床医生提供参考

Abstract: Purpose: Thyroid cancer has been a common cancer. Papillary thyroid cancer
and follicular thyroid cancer are the two most common types of thyroid cancer.
Follicular thyroid cancer lacks distinctive ultrasound signs and is more
difficult to diagnose preoperatively than the more prevalent papillary thyroid
cancer, and the clinical studies associated with it are less well established.
We aimed to analyze the clinical data of follicular thyroid cancer based on a
novel data mining tool to identify some clinical indications that may help in
preoperative diagnosis. Methods: We performed a retrospective analysis based on
case data collected by the Department of General Surgery of Peking University
Third Hospital between 2010 and 2023. Unlike traditional statistical methods,
we improved the association rule mining, a classical data mining method, and
proposed new analytical metrics reflecting the malignant association between
clinical indications and cancer with the help of the idea of SHAP method in
interpretable machine learning. Results: The dataset was preprocessed to
contain 1673 cases (in terms of nodes rather than patients), of which 1414 were
benign and 259 were malignant nodes. Our analysis pointed out that in addition
to some common indicators (e.g., irregular or lobulated nodal margins, uneven
thickness halo, hypoechogenicity), there were also some indicators with strong
malignant associations, such as nodule-in-nodule pattern, trabecular pattern,
and low TSH scores. In addition, our results suggest that the combination of
Hashimoto's thyroiditis may also have a strong malignant association.
Conclusion: In the preoperative diagnosis of nodules suspected of follicular
thyroid cancer, multiple clinical indications should be considered for a more
accurate diagnosis. The diverse malignant associations identified in our study
may serve as a reference for clinicians in related fields.

Abstract: This work introduces InJecteD, a framework for interpreting Denoising
Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) by analyzing sample trajectories during
the denoising process of 2D point cloud generation. We apply this framework to
three datasets from the Datasaurus Dozen bullseye, dino, and circle using a

approach quantifies trajectory properties, including displacement, velocity,
clustering, and drift field dynamics, using statistical metrics such as
Wasserstein distance and cosine similarity. By enhancing model transparency,
InJecteD supports human AI collaboration by enabling practitioners to debug and
refine generative models. Experiments reveal distinct denoising phases: initial
noise exploration, rapid shape formation, and final refinement, with
dataset-specific behaviors example, bullseyes concentric convergence vs. dinos
complex contour formation. We evaluate four model configurations, varying
embeddings and noise schedules, demonstrating that Fourier based embeddings
improve trajectory stability and reconstruction quality

Motivation: JEPA架构在视觉表示学习和基于模型的RL中应用日益广泛，但其行为机制仍缺乏理论理解，需要系统分析其表示学习特性

Method: 提出一个简单的JEPA变体，包含联合训练的辅助回归头和潜在动态模型，在确定性MDP框架下进行理论分析，并通过计数环境中的控制实验进行验证

Result: 证明了No Unhealthy Representation Collapse定理：当潜在转移一致性损失和辅助回归损失都趋近于零时，任何具有不同转移动态或辅助标签的非等价观测必须映射到不同的潜在表示

Conclusion: 辅助任务锚定了表示必须保留的区分信息，联合训练JEPA模型和辅助头能产生比单独训练更丰富的表示，为改进JEPA编码器指明了路径

Abstract: Joint-Embedding Predictive Architecture (JEPA) is increasingly used for
visual representation learning and as a component in model-based RL, but its
behavior remains poorly understood. We provide a theoretical characterization
of a simple, practical JEPA variant that has an auxiliary regression head
trained jointly with latent dynamics. We prove a No Unhealthy Representation
Collapse theorem: in deterministic MDPs, if training drives both the
latent-transition consistency loss and the auxiliary regression loss to zero,
then any pair of non-equivalent observations, i.e., those that do not have the
same transition dynamics or auxiliary label, must map to distinct latent
representations. Thus, the auxiliary task anchors which distinctions the
representation must preserve. Controlled ablations in a counting environment
corroborate the theory and show that training the JEPA model jointly with the
auxiliary head generates a richer representation than training them separately.
Our work indicates a path to improve JEPA encoders: training them with an
auxiliary function that, together with the transition dynamics, encodes the
right equivalence relations.

Conclusion: GraphSAGE框架具有出色的适应性、可扩展性和可解释性，为金融机构利用图机器学习从交易生态系统中获取可操作洞察提供了蓝图。

Abstract: Financial institutions increasingly require scalable tools to analyse complex
transactional networks, yet traditional graph embedding methods struggle with
dynamic, real-world banking data. This paper demonstrates the practical
application of GraphSAGE, an inductive Graph Neural Network framework, to
non-bipartite heterogeneous transaction networks within a banking context.
Unlike transductive approaches, GraphSAGE scales well to large networks and can
generalise to unseen nodes which is critical for institutions working with
temporally evolving transactional data. We construct a transaction network
using anonymised customer and merchant transactions and train a GraphSAGE model
to generate node embeddings. Our exploratory work on the embeddings reveals
interpretable clusters aligned with geographic and demographic attributes.
Additionally, we illustrate their utility in downstream classification tasks by
applying them to a money mule detection model where using these embeddings
improves the prioritisation of high-risk accounts. Beyond fraud detection, our
work highlights the adaptability of this framework to banking-scale networks,
emphasising its inductive capability, scalability, and interpretability. This
study provides a blueprint for financial organisations to harness graph machine
learning for actionable insights in transactional ecosystems.

Abstract: In this paper, we present a maximum likelihood estimation approach to
determine the value vector in transformer models. We model the sequence of
value vectors, key vectors, and the query vector as a sequence of Gaussian
distributions. The variance in each Gaussian distribution depends on the time
step, the corresponding key vector, and the query vector. The mean value in
each Gaussian distribution depends on the time step, and the corresponding
value vector. This analysis may offer a new explanation of the
scaled-dot-product function or softmax function used in transformer

maximum entropy approach in natural language processing [5]. In this approach,
a query vector and key vectors are used to derive the feature functions for the

Conclusion: C3DE模型有效解决了长期城市人流预测中的累积误差和虚假相关性问题，通过因果感知的协作机制显著提升了预测准确性

Abstract: Long-term urban crowd flow prediction suffers significantly from cumulative
sampling errors, due to increased sequence lengths and sampling intervals,
which inspired us to leverage Neural Controlled Differential Equations (NCDEs)
to mitigate this issue. However, regarding the crucial influence of Points of
Interest (POIs) evolution on long-term crowd flow, the multi-timescale
asynchronous dynamics between crowd flow and POI distribution, coupled with
latent spurious causality, poses challenges to applying NCDEs for long-term
urban crowd flow prediction. To this end, we propose Causal-aware Collaborative
neural CDE (C3DE) to model the long-term dynamic of crowd flow. Specifically,
we introduce a dual-path NCDE as the backbone to effectively capture the
asynchronous evolution of collaborative signals across multiple time scales.
Then, we design a dynamic correction mechanism with the counterfactual-based
causal effect estimator to quantify the causal impact of POIs on crowd flow and
minimize the accumulation of spurious correlations. Finally, we leverage a
predictor for long-term prediction with the fused collaborative signals of POI
and crowd flow. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate
the superior performance of C3DE, particularly in cities with notable flow
fluctuations.

Motivation: 理解神经网络如何有机地学习为后续处理准备输入数据，并研究KA几何结构的涌现机制以通过及时调整超参数来加速学习。

Method: 通过分析Jacobian矩阵J(x)的外部幂的统计特性来量化KA几何结构，包括零行数量和次要统计量，以测量J(x)的尺度和轴对齐。

Result: 发现在普通单隐藏层神经网络的训练过程中，KA几何结构经常会产生，并对其在函数复杂度和模型超参数空间中的出现位置有了初步理解。

Conclusion: 这项研究是KA网络（KANs）的"另一面"，不是将KA工程化到神经网络中，而是观察KA在浅层MLP中的自然涌现。

Abstract: The Kolmogorov-Arnold (KA) representation theorem constructs universal, but
highly non-smooth inner functions (the first layer map) in a single
(non-linear) hidden layer neural network. Such universal functions have a
distinctive local geometry, a "texture," which can be characterized by the
inner function's Jacobian $J({\mathbf{x}})$, as $\mathbf{x}$ varies over the
data. It is natural to ask if this distinctive KA geometry emerges through
conventional neural network optimization. We find that indeed KA geometry often
is produced when training vanilla single hidden layer neural networks. We
quantify KA geometry through the statistical properties of the exterior powers
of $J(\mathbf{x})$: number of zero rows and various observables for the minor
statistics of $J(\mathbf{x})$, which measure the scale and axis alignment of
$J(\mathbf{x})$. This leads to a rough understanding for where KA geometry
occurs in the space of function complexity and model hyperparameters. The
motivation is first to understand how neural networks organically learn to
prepare input data for later downstream processing and, second, to learn enough
about the emergence of KA geometry to accelerate learning through a timely
intervention in network hyperparameters. This research is the "flip side" of
KA-Networks (KANs). We do not engineer KA into the neural network, but rather
watch KA emerge in shallow MLPs.

Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to optimizing pricing and replenishment
strategies in fresh food supermarkets by combining Long Short-Term Memory
(LSTM) networks with Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). The LSTM model,
enhanced with an attention mechanism, is used to predict sales volumes, pricing
trends, and spoilage rates over a seven-day period. The predictions generated
by the LSTM model serve as inputs for the PSO algorithm, which iteratively
optimizes pricing and replenishment strategies to maximize profitability while
adhering to inventory constraints. The integration of cost-plus pricing allows
for dynamic adjustments based on fixed and variable costs, ensuring real-time
adaptability to market fluctuations. The framework not only maximizes profits
but also reduces food waste, contributing to more sustainable supermarket
operations. The attention mechanism enhances the interpretability of the LSTM
model by identifying key time points and factors influencing sales, improving
decision-making accuracy. This methodology bridges the gap between predictive
modeling and optimization, offering a scalable solution for dynamic pricing and
inventory management in fresh food retail and other industries dealing with

<details>

Motivation: 标准DeepONet使用全连接线性层作为主干网络，在捕捉复杂PDE空间结构方面存在局限性，需要改进空间表示能力

Method: 在DeepONet架构中引入傅里叶嵌入主干网络，利用随机傅里叶特征映射来丰富空间表示能力

Conclusion: 傅里叶嵌入能有效增强神经算子学习，为PDE代理建模提供了鲁棒且广泛适用的方法

Abstract: Deep Operator Networks (DeepONets) have recently emerged as powerful
data-driven frameworks for learning nonlinear operators, particularly suited
for approximating solutions to partial differential equations (PDEs). Despite
their promising capabilities, the standard implementation of DeepONets, which
typically employs fully connected linear layers in the trunk network, can
encounter limitations in capturing complex spatial structures inherent to
various PDEs. To address this, we introduce Fourier-embedded trunk networks
within the DeepONet architecture, leveraging random Fourier feature mappings to
enrich spatial representation capabilities. Our proposed Fourier-embedded
DeepONet, FEDONet demonstrates superior performance compared to the traditional
DeepONet across a comprehensive suite of PDE-driven datasets, including the
two-dimensional Poisson equation, Burgers' equation, the Lorenz-63 chaotic
system, Eikonal equation, Allen-Cahn equation, Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation,
and the Lorenz-96 system. Empirical evaluations of FEDONet consistently show
significant improvements in solution reconstruction accuracy, with average
relative L2 performance gains ranging between 2-3x compared to the DeepONet
baseline. This study highlights the effectiveness of Fourier embeddings in
enhancing neural operator learning, offering a robust and broadly applicable
methodology for PDE surrogate modeling.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工程师薪资预测任务面临两个主要挑战：300维词嵌入导致的高维特征和有限的训练样本数量。现有的线性降维方法在表格数据分类中研究不足，特别是如何有效处理词嵌入特征。

Method: 研究PCA和LDA两种线性降维方法。提出Partitioned-LDA方法：将300维词嵌入分成等大小的块，在每个块上分别执行LDA，从而减小协方差矩阵的规模。结合收缩正则化处理协方差估计误差问题。

Result: PCA在合适的子空间维度下优于原始嵌入；未正则化的LDA性能较差，但应用收缩后性能显著提升；Partitioned-LDA方法优于常规LDA，结合收缩后在竞赛公开排行榜上达到top-10准确率。

Conclusion: Partitioned-LDA结合收缩正则化能有效提升词嵌入在有限训练样本表格数据分类中的性能，为解决高维特征和样本不足问题提供了有效方案。

Abstract: The Engineers' Salary Prediction Challenge requires classifying salary
categories into three classes based on tabular data. The job description is
represented as a 300-dimensional word embedding incorporated into the tabular
features, drastically increasing dimensionality. Additionally, the limited
number of training samples makes classification challenging. Linear
dimensionality reduction of word embeddings for tabular data classification
remains underexplored. This paper studies Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA). We show that PCA, with an appropriate
subspace dimension, can outperform raw embeddings. LDA without regularization
performs poorly due to covariance estimation errors, but applying shrinkage
improves performance significantly, even with only two dimensions. We propose
Partitioned-LDA, which splits embeddings into equal-sized blocks and performs
LDA separately on each, thereby reducing the size of the covariance matrices.
Partitioned-LDA outperforms regular LDA and, combined with shrinkage, achieves
top-10 accuracy on the competition public leaderboard. This method effectively
enhances word embedding performance in tabular data classification with limited
training samples.

Conclusion: MEAGraph为表示学习和聚类提供了有效方法，可用于数据分析、异常检测和数据集优化，解决了高维原子描述符带来的聚类挑战。

Abstract: Constructing a chemically diverse dataset while avoiding sampling bias is
critical to training efficient and generalizable force fields. However, in
computational chemistry and materials science, many common dataset generation
techniques are prone to oversampling regions of the potential energy surface.
Furthermore, these regions can be difficult to identify and isolate from each
other or may not align well with human intuition, making it challenging to
systematically remove bias in the dataset. While traditional clustering and
pruning (down-sampling) approaches can be useful for this, they can often lead
to information loss or a failure to properly identify distinct regions of the
potential energy surface due to difficulties associated with the high
dimensionality of atomic descriptors. In this work, we introduce the
Multi-kernel Edge Attention-based Graph Autoencoder (MEAGraph) model, an
unsupervised approach for analyzing atomic datasets. MEAGraph combines multiple
linear kernel transformations with attention-based message passing to capture
geometric sensitivity and enable effective dataset pruning without relying on
labels or extensive training. Demonstrated applications on niobium, tantalum,
and iron datasets show that MEAGraph efficiently groups similar atomic
environments, allowing for the use of basic pruning techniques for removing
sampling bias. This approach provides an effective method for representation
learning and clustering that can be used for data analysis, outlier detection,
and dataset optimization.

Abstract: The agricultural sector is undergoing a transformation with the integration
of advanced technologies, particularly in data-driven decision-making. This
work proposes a federated learning framework for smart farming, aiming to
develop a scalable, efficient, and secure solution for crop disease detection
tailored to the environmental and operational conditions of Minnesota farms. By
maintaining sensitive farm data locally and enabling collaborative model
updates, our proposed framework seeks to achieve high accuracy in crop disease
classification without compromising data privacy. We outline a methodology
involving data collection from Minnesota farms, application of local deep
learning algorithms, transfer learning, and a central aggregation server for
model refinement, aiming to achieve improved accuracy in disease detection,
good generalization across agricultural scenarios, lower costs in communication
and training time, and earlier identification and intervention against diseases
in future implementations. We outline a methodology and anticipated outcomes,
setting the stage for empirical validation in subsequent studies. This work
comes in a context where more and more demand for data-driven interpretations
in agriculture has to be weighed with concerns about privacy from farms that
are hesitant to share their operational data. This will be important to provide
a secure and efficient disease detection method that can finally revolutionize
smart farming systems and solve local agricultural problems with data
confidentiality. In doing so, this paper bridges the gap between advanced
machine learning techniques and the practical, privacy-sensitive needs of
farmers in Minnesota and beyond, leveraging the benefits of federated learning.

Abstract: The nuclear industry is advancing toward more new reactor designs, with
next-generation reactors expected to be smaller in scale and power output.
These systems have the potential to produce large volumes of information in the
form of multivariate time-series data, which could be used for enhanced
real-time monitoring and control. In this context, the development of remote
autonomous or semi-autonomous control systems for reactor operation has gained
significant interest. A critical first step toward such systems is an accurate
diagnostics module capable of detecting and localizing anomalies within the
reactor system. Recent studies have proposed various ML and DL approaches for
anomaly detection in the nuclear domain. Despite promising results, key
challenges remain, including limited to no explainability, lack of access to
real-world data, and scarcity of abnormal events, which impedes benchmarking
and characterization. Most existing studies treat these methods as black boxes,
while recent work highlights the need for greater interpretability of ML/DL
outputs in safety-critical domains. Here, we propose an unsupervised
methodology based on an LSTM autoencoder with a dual attention mechanism for
characterization of abnormal events in a real-world reactor radiation area
monitoring system. The framework includes not only detection but also
localization of the event and was evaluated using real-world datasets of
increasing complexity from the PUR-1 research reactor. The attention mechanisms
operate in both the feature and temporal dimensions, where the feature
attention assigns weights to radiation sensors exhibiting abnormal patterns,
while time attention highlights the specific timesteps where irregularities
occur, thus enabling localization. By combining the results, the framework can
identify both the affected sensors and the duration of each anomaly within a
single unified network.

Abstract: Training deep learning methods on small time series datasets that also
include corrupted samples is challenging. Diffusion models have shown to be
effective to generate realistic and synthetic data, and correct corrupted
samples through imputation. In this context, this paper focuses on generating
synthetic yet realistic samples of automotive time series data. We show that
denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs) can effectively solve this
task by applying them to a challenging vehicle CAN-dataset with long-term data
and a limited number of samples. Therefore, we propose a hybrid generative
approach that combines autoregressive and non-autoregressive techniques. We
evaluate our approach with two recently proposed DDPM architectures for time
series generation, for which we propose several improvements. To evaluate the
generated samples, we propose three metrics that quantify physical correctness
and test track adherence. Our best model is able to outperform even the
training data in terms of physical correctness, while showing plausible driving
behavior. Finally, we use our best model to successfully impute physically
implausible regions in the training data, thereby improving the data quality.

Abstract: Modern deep learning models excel at pattern recognition but remain
fundamentally limited by their reliance on spurious correlations, leading to
poor generalization and a demand for massive datasets. We argue that a key
ingredient for human-like intelligence-robust, sample-efficient learning-stems
from an understanding of causal mechanisms. In this work, we introduce
Causal-Symbolic Meta-Learning (CSML), a novel framework that learns to infer
the latent causal structure of a task distribution. CSML comprises three key
modules: a perception module that maps raw inputs to disentangled symbolic
representations; a differentiable causal induction module that discovers the
underlying causal graph governing these symbols and a graph-based reasoning
module that leverages this graph to make predictions. By meta-learning a shared
causal world model across a distribution of tasks, CSML can rapidly adapt to
novel tasks, including those requiring reasoning about interventions and
counterfactuals, from only a handful of examples. We introduce CausalWorld, a
new physics-based benchmark designed to test these capabilities. Our
experiments show that CSML dramatically outperforms state-of-the-art
meta-learning and neuro-symbolic baselines, particularly on tasks demanding
true causal inference.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的前向-前向算法扩展版本在处理卷积神经网络时存在表示能力有限和可扩展性差的问题，主要是由于通道维度爆炸导致的。需要一种新的训练框架来解决这些问题。

Method: 提出自适应空间优良性编码（ASGE）框架，利用特征图计算每层的空间感知优良性表示，实现逐层监督，并将分类复杂度与通道维度解耦。

Result: 在多个基准测试中优于其他基于前向-前向的方法：MNIST 99.65%、FashionMNIST 93.41%、CIFAR-10 90.62%、CIFAR-100 65.42%。首次在ImageNet上实现前向-前向训练，Top-1准确率26.21%，Top-5准确率47.49%。

Conclusion: ASGE框架完全消除了反向传播，显著缩小了与BP训练模型的性能差距，为可扩展的无反向传播CNN训练奠定了可行基础。

Abstract: The Forward-Forward (FF) algorithm offers a promising alternative to
backpropagation (BP). Despite advancements in recent FF-based extensions, which
have enhanced the original algorithm and adapted it to convolutional neural
networks (CNNs), they often suffer from limited representational capacity and
poor scalability to large-scale datasets, primarily due to exploding channel
dimensionality. In this work, we propose adaptive spatial goodness encoding
(ASGE), a new FF-based training framework tailored for CNNs. ASGE leverages
feature maps to compute spatially-aware goodness representations at each layer,
enabling layer-wise supervision. Crucially, this approach decouples
classification complexity from channel dimensionality, thereby addressing the
issue of channel explosion and achieving competitive performance compared to
other BP-free methods. ASGE outperforms all other FF-based approaches across
multiple benchmarks, delivering test accuracies of 99.65% on MNIST, 93.41% on
FashionMNIST, 90.62% on CIFAR-10, and 65.42% on CIFAR-100. Moreover, we present
the first successful application of FF-based training to ImageNet, with Top-1
and Top-5 accuracies of 26.21% and 47.49%. By entirely eliminating BP and
significantly narrowing the performance gap with BP-trained models, the ASGE
framework establishes a viable foundation toward scalable BP-free CNN training.

Conclusion: 该框架支持在不确定性关键领域进行稳健的谱学习，为更广泛的贝叶斯谱机器学习奠定了基础，在谱病态条件下表现出优雅的性能退化。

Abstract: Scientific machine learning increasingly uses spectral methods to understand
physical systems. Current spectral learning approaches provide only point
estimates without uncertainty quantification, limiting their use in
safety-critical applications where prediction confidence is essential.
Parametric matrix models have emerged as powerful tools for scientific machine
learning, achieving exceptional performance by learning governing equations.
However, their deterministic nature limits deployment in uncertainty
quantification applications. We introduce Bayesian parametric matrix models
(B-PMMs), a principled framework that extends PMMs to provide uncertainty
estimates while preserving their spectral structure and computational
efficiency. B-PMM addresses the fundamental challenge of quantifying
uncertainty in matrix eigenvalue problems where standard Bayesian methods fail
due to the geometric constraints of spectral decomposition. The theoretical
contributions include: (i) adaptive spectral decomposition with regularized
matrix perturbation bounds that characterize eigenvalue uncertainty
propagation, (ii) structured variational inference algorithms using
manifold-aware matrix-variate Gaussian posteriors that respect Hermitian
constraints, and (iii) finite-sample calibration guarantees with explicit
dependence on spectral gaps and problem conditioning. Experimental validation
across matrix dimensions from 5x5 to 500x500 with perfect convergence rates
demonstrates that B-PMMs achieve exceptional uncertainty calibration (ECE <
0.05) while maintaining favorable scaling. The framework exhibits graceful
degradation under spectral ill-conditioning and provides reliable uncertainty
estimates even in near-degenerate regimes. The proposed framework supports
robust spectral learning in uncertainty-critical domains and lays the
groundwork for broader Bayesian spectral machine learning.

Conclusion: SRI方法通过低维表示学习有效解决了机器学习标注中的偏差问题，显著提高了统计推断的精度和鲁棒性。

Abstract: As researchers increasingly rely on machine learning models and LLMs to
annotate unstructured data, such as texts or images, various approaches have
been proposed to correct bias in downstream statistical analysis. However,
existing methods tend to yield large standard errors and require some
error-free human annotation. In this paper, I introduce Surrogate
Representation Inference (SRI), which assumes that unstructured data fully
mediate the relationship between human annotations and structured variables.
The assumption is guaranteed by design provided that human coders rely only on
unstructured data for annotation. Under this setting, I propose a neural
network architecture that learns a low-dimensional representation of
unstructured data such that the surrogate assumption remains to be satisfied.
When multiple human annotations are available, SRI can further correct
non-differential measurement errors that may exist in human annotations.
Focusing on text-as-outcome settings, I formally establish the identification
conditions and semiparametric efficient estimation strategies that enable
learning and leveraging such a low-dimensional representation. Simulation
studies and a real-world application demonstrate that SRI reduces standard
errors by over 50% when machine learning prediction accuracy is moderate and
provides valid inference even when human annotations contain non-differential
measurement errors.

Abstract: The combinatorial multi-armed bandit model is designed to maximize cumulative
rewards in the presence of uncertainty by activating a subset of arms in each
round. This paper is inspired by two critical applications in wireless
networks, where it's not only essential to maximize cumulative rewards but also
to guarantee fairness among arms (i.e., the minimum average reward required by
each arm) and ensure reward regularity (i.e., how often each arm receives the
reward). In this paper, we propose a parameterized regular and fair learning
algorithm to achieve these three objectives. In particular, the proposed
algorithm linearly combines virtual queue-lengths (tracking the fairness
violations), Time-Since-Last-Reward (TSLR) metrics, and Upper Confidence Bound
(UCB) estimates in its weight measure. Here, TSLR is similar to
age-of-information and measures the elapsed number of rounds since the last
time an arm received a reward, capturing the reward regularity performance, and
UCB estimates are utilized to balance the tradeoff between exploration and
exploitation in online learning. By exploring a key relationship between
virtual queue-lengths and TSLR metrics and utilizing several non-trivial
Lyapunov functions, we analytically characterize zero cumulative fairness
violation, reward regularity, and cumulative regret performance under our
proposed algorithm. These theoretical outcomes are verified by simulations
based on two real-world datasets.

Motivation: 比较边界元法和物理信息神经网络在相同条件下求解Helmholtz方程波散射问题的性能，为波动传播问题的研究方法选择提供定量依据。

Method: 使用BEM通过边界离散化求解，PINNs通过最小化控制方程和边界条件的残差进行训练，并进行超参数优化。评估指标包括求解精度、计算时间和泛化能力。

Result: 在相同精度下，PINNs训练时间比BEM长42倍，但评估速度快204倍。在训练域外泛化时，PINNs相对误差从0.0746增加到8.22，而BEM在扩展区域保持相似误差水平。

Abstract: Purpose - This study compares the Boundary Element Method (BEM) and
Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) for solving the two-dimensional
Helmholtz equation in wave scattering problems. The objective is to evaluate
the performance of both methods under the same conditions.
  Design/methodology/approach - We solve the Helmholtz equation using BEM and
PINNs for the same scattering problem. The PINNs are trained by minimizing the
residual of the governing equations and boundary conditions, with their
configuration determined through hyperparameter optimization, while the BEM is
applied using boundary discretization. Both methods are evaluated in terms of
solution accuracy, computation time, and generalization capacity.
  Findings - Numerical experiments were conducted by varying the number of
integration points for BEM and the number of layers and neurons per layer for
PINNs. Hyperparameter tuning provided further insight into suitable
configurations for wave scattering problems. At comparable accuracy, PINNs
produced consistent solutions but required training times approximately 42
times longer than BEM. However, once trained, PINNs achieved evaluation times
up to 204 times faster. The generalization capacity was also assessed outside
the PINN training domain, where the relative error increased from $7.46 \times
10^{-2}$ to 8.22, while BEM maintained a similar error level in the extended
region.
  Originality/value - This work presents a direct comparison between PINNs and
BEM for the Helmholtz equation. The analysis provides quantitative data on the
performance of both methods, supporting their selection in future research on
wave propagation problems and establishing future challenges and directions.

Result: 理论证明NTM在静态图博弈中具有通用逼近性质，数值实验表明NTM方法在保持性能的同时显著提高了计算效率。

Abstract: We propose a novel neural network architecture, called Non-Trainable
Modification (NTM), for computing Nash equilibria in stochastic differential
games (SDGs) on graphs. These games model a broad class of graph-structured
multi-agent systems arising in finance, robotics, energy, and social dynamics,
where agents interact locally under uncertainty. The NTM architecture imposes a
graph-guided sparsification on feedforward neural networks, embedding fixed,
non-trainable components aligned with the underlying graph topology. This
design enhances interpretability and stability, while significantly reducing
the number of trainable parameters in large-scale, sparse settings. We
theoretically establish a universal approximation property for NTM in static
games on graphs and numerically validate its expressivity and robustness
through supervised learning tasks. Building on this foundation, we incorporate
NTM into two state-of-the-art game solvers, Direct Parameterization and Deep
BSDE, yielding their sparse variants (NTM-DP and NTM-DBSDE). Numerical
experiments on three SDGs across various graph structures demonstrate that
NTM-based methods achieve performance comparable to their fully trainable
counterparts, while offering improved computational efficiency.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本研究评估了基础模型在fMRI脑信号预测和因果发现中的表现，与传统Wiener-Granger因果方法相比，基础模型在零样本设置下表现出色，提供了更精确的因果交互检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着基础模型的兴起，需要了解它们在脑信号预测和因果分析方面与传统方法的比较，以及是否可以在零样本设置下应用。

Method: 使用基础模型在零样本和微调设置下测试预测能力，通过比较模型产生的Granger-like估计与标准Granger因果来评估因果性，并使用逻辑映射耦合和Ornstein-Uhlenbeck过程生成的合成时间序列进行验证。

Result: 基础模型在零样本预测fMRI时间序列方面表现竞争性（对照组MAPE为0.55，患者组为0.27），虽然标准Granger因果在模型间未显示明显定量差异，但基础模型提供了更精确的因果交互检测。

Conclusion: 基础模型具有多功能性、强大的零样本性能，在时间序列数据的预测和因果发现方面具有潜在应用价值。

Abstract: Time-series forecasting and causal discovery are central in neuroscience, as
predicting brain activity and identifying causal relationships between neural
populations and circuits can shed light on the mechanisms underlying cognition
and disease. With the rise of foundation models, an open question is how they
compare to traditional methods for brain signal forecasting and causality
analysis, and whether they can be applied in a zero-shot setting. In this work,
we evaluate a foundation model against classical methods for inferring
directional interactions from spontaneous brain activity measured with
functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in humans. Traditional approaches
often rely on Wiener-Granger causality. We tested the forecasting ability of
the foundation model in both zero-shot and fine-tuned settings, and assessed
causality by comparing Granger-like estimates from the model with standard
Granger causality. We validated the approach using synthetic time series
generated from ground-truth causal models, including logistic map coupling and
Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes. The foundation model achieved competitive
zero-shot forecasting fMRI time series (mean absolute percentage error of 0.55
in controls and 0.27 in patients). Although standard Granger causality did not
show clear quantitative differences between models, the foundation model
provided a more precise detection of causal interactions.
  Overall, these findings suggest that foundation models offer versatility,
strong zero-shot performance, and potential utility for forecasting and causal
discovery in time-series data.

*Yifan Lan,Yuanpu Cao,Weitong Zhang,Lu Lin,Jinghui Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文揭示了多模态大语言模型(MLLMs)的新安全风险：通过精心优化的图像可以任意操纵MLLMs的输出偏好，生成上下文相关但有偏见的响应，难以检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着多模态大语言模型在各个领域的广泛应用，其安全性问题日益凸显。研究发现MLLMs的输出偏好可能被恶意操纵，产生难以察觉的有偏见响应，这构成了新的安全威胁。

Method: 提出了Preference Hijacking (Phi)方法，通过在推理时使用偏好劫持图像来操纵MLLM响应偏好，无需修改模型。还引入了通用劫持扰动，可嵌入不同图像中以劫持MLLM响应到攻击者指定的偏好。

Result: 在各种任务上的实验结果表明该方法具有有效性，能够成功操纵MLLMs的输出偏好。

Conclusion: 该研究揭示了MLLMs存在被图像攻击操纵输出偏好的安全漏洞，提出了有效的攻击方法Phi，为MLLMs的安全性研究提供了重要见解，代码已开源。

Abstract: Recently, Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have gained significant
attention across various domains. However, their widespread adoption has also
raised serious safety concerns. In this paper, we uncover a new safety risk of
MLLMs: the output preference of MLLMs can be arbitrarily manipulated by
carefully optimized images. Such attacks often generate contextually relevant
yet biased responses that are neither overtly harmful nor unethical, making
them difficult to detect. Specifically, we introduce a novel method, Preference
Hijacking (Phi), for manipulating the MLLM response preferences using a
preference hijacked image. Our method works at inference time and requires no
model modifications. Additionally, we introduce a universal hijacking
perturbation -- a transferable component that can be embedded into different
images to hijack MLLM responses toward any attacker-specified preferences.
Experimental results across various tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach. The code for Phi is accessible at https://github.com/Yifan-Lan/Phi.

variational method for skeleton construction. Across six datasets and multiple

12--15\% at the same risk, and maintain runtime overhead below 20\% (further
reduced via batching).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有GNN在异质图上表现不佳，甚至不如简单的MLP，需要超越架构设计的新方法来直接解决异质性问题

Method: 通过创建特征节点来促进具有相似特征节点之间的同质性消息传递，直接转换图结构以提高同质性

Result: 在挑战性数据集上显著优于21种最新GNN方法，同时在同质图上达到与最先进方法相当的精度

Conclusion: GRAPHITE通过直接提高图同质性的新范式，有效解决了图异质性挑战，为GNN在异质图上的应用提供了创新思路

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have emerged as a powerful tool for modeling
graph-structured data. However, existing GNNs often struggle with heterophilic
graphs, where connected nodes tend to have dissimilar features or labels. While
numerous methods have been proposed to address this challenge, they primarily
focus on architectural designs without directly targeting the root cause of the
heterophily problem. These approaches still perform even worse than the
simplest MLPs on challenging heterophilic datasets. For instance, our
experiments show that 21 latest GNNs still fall behind the MLP on the Actor
dataset. This critical challenge calls for an innovative approach to addressing
graph heterophily beyond architectural designs. To bridge this gap, we propose
and study a new and unexplored paradigm: directly increasing the graph
homophily via a carefully designed graph transformation. In this work, we
present a simple yet effective framework called GRAPHITE to address graph
heterophily. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first method that
explicitly transforms the graph to directly improve the graph homophily.
Stemmed from the exact definition of homophily, our proposed GRAPHITE creates
feature nodes to facilitate homophilic message passing between nodes that share
similar features. Furthermore, we both theoretically and empirically show that
our proposed GRAPHITE significantly increases the homophily of originally
heterophilic graphs, with only a slight increase in the graph size. Extensive
experiments on challenging datasets demonstrate that our proposed GRAPHITE
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on heterophilic graphs while
achieving comparable accuracy with state-of-the-art methods on homophilic
graphs.

Conclusion: 基于跨模态深度度量学习的方法有效解决了时间序列异常检测的敏感性和效率问题，为时间序列数据分析提供了有效的技术手段。

Abstract: To effectively address the issues of low sensitivity and high time
consumption in time series anomaly detection, we propose an anomaly detection
method based on cross-modal deep metric learning. A cross-modal deep metric
learning feature clustering model is constructed, composed of an input layer, a
triplet selection layer, and a loss function computation layer. The squared
Euclidean distances between cluster centers are calculated, and a stochastic
gradient descent strategy is employed to optimize the model and classify
different time series features. The inner product of principal component
direction vectors is used as a metric for anomaly measurement. The von
Mises-Fisher (vMF) distribution is applied to describe the directional
characteristics of time series data, and historical data is used to train and
obtain evaluation parameters. By comparing the principal component direction
vector of actual time series data with the threshold, anomaly detection is
performed. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method accurately
classifies time series data with different attributes, exhibits high
sensitivity to anomalies, and achieves high detection accuracy, fast detection
speed, and strong robustness.

Abstract: Logit Knowledge Distillation has gained substantial research interest in
recent years due to its simplicity and lack of requirement for intermediate
feature alignment; however, it suffers from limited interpretability in its
decision-making process. To address this, we propose implicit Clustering
Distillation (iCD): a simple and effective method that mines and transfers
interpretable structural knowledge from logits, without requiring ground-truth
labels or feature-space alignment. iCD leverages Gram matrices over decoupled
local logit representations to enable student models to learn latent semantic
structural patterns. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate
the effectiveness of iCD across diverse teacher-student architectures, with
particularly strong performance in fine-grained classification tasks --
achieving a peak improvement of +5.08% over the baseline. The code is available

Motivation: 现有学习延迟(L2D)方法对专家组成变化敏感，需要大量重新训练。需要一种无需重新训练、对模型和专家都无关的延迟框架来提高人机协作的可靠性。

Method: 使用共形预测器生成预测集来识别标签特定不确定性，通过可分离性准则选择最能区分剩余可能标签的专家。

Result: 在CIFAR10-H和ImageNet16-H上分别达到99.57±0.10%和99.40±0.52%的准确率，专家工作量最多减少11倍，在专家性能下降时仍保持稳健。

Conclusion: 该方法为现实世界人机协作提供了一种可扩展、无需重新训练的L2D替代方案，在保持高性能的同时显著降低专家工作量。

Abstract: AI systems often fail to deliver reliable predictions across all inputs,
prompting the need for hybrid human-AI decision-making. Existing Learning to
Defer (L2D) approaches address this by training deferral models, but these are
sensitive to changes in expert composition and require significant retraining
if experts change. We propose a training-free, model- and expert-agnostic
framework for expert deferral based on conformal prediction. Our method uses
the prediction set generated by a conformal predictor to identify
label-specific uncertainty and selects the most discriminative expert using a
segregativity criterion, measuring how well an expert distinguishes between the
remaining plausible labels. Experiments on CIFAR10-H and ImageNet16-H show that
our method consistently outperforms both the standalone model and the strongest
expert, with accuracies attaining $99.57\pm0.10\%$ and $99.40\pm0.52\%$, while
reducing expert workload by up to a factor of $11$. The method remains robust
under degraded expert performance and shows a gradual performance drop in
low-information settings. These results suggest a scalable, retraining-free
alternative to L2D for real-world human-AI collaboration.

Abstract: Training data attribution (TDA) plays a critical role in understanding the
influence of individual training data points on model predictions.
Gradient-based TDA methods, popularized by \textit{influence function} for
their superior performance, have been widely applied in data selection, data
cleaning, data economics, and fact tracing. However, in real-world scenarios
where commercial models are not publicly accessible and computational resources
are limited, existing TDA methods are often constrained by their reliance on
full model access and high computational costs. This poses significant
challenges to the broader adoption of TDA in practical applications.
  In this work, we present a systematic study of TDA methods under various
access and resource constraints. We investigate the feasibility of performing
TDA under varying levels of access constraints by leveraging appropriately
designed solutions such as proxy models. Besides, we demonstrate that
attribution scores obtained from models without prior training on the target
dataset remain informative across a range of tasks, which is useful for
scenarios where computational resources are limited. Our findings provide
practical guidance for deploying TDA in real-world environments, aiming to
improve feasibility and efficiency under limited access.

Abstract: Multimodal data provides heterogeneous information for a holistic

poorly generalizable representations. Here we present MICE (Multimodal data
Integration via Collaborative Experts), a multimodal foundation model that

comprehensively capture both cross-cancer and cancer-specific insights.
Leveraging data from 11,799 patients across 30 cancer types, we enhanced MICE's
generalizability by coupling contrastive and supervised learning. MICE
outperformed both unimodal and state-of-the-art multi-expert-based multimodal

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) presents significant potential for collaborative
optimization without data sharing. Since synthetic data is sent to the server,
leveraging the popular concept of dataset distillation, this FL framework
protects real data privacy while alleviating data heterogeneity. However, such
methods are still challenged by the redundant information and noise in entire
spatial-domain designs, which inevitably increases the communication burden. In
this paper, we propose a novel Frequency-Domain aware FL method with
high-energy concentration (FedFD) to address this problem. Our FedFD is
inspired by the discovery that the discrete cosine transform predominantly
distributes energy to specific regions, referred to as high-energy
concentration. The principle behind FedFD is that low-energy like
high-frequency components usually contain redundant information and noise, thus
filtering them helps reduce communication costs and optimize performance. Our
FedFD is mathematically formulated to preserve the low-frequency components
using a binary mask, facilitating an optimal solution through frequency-domain
distribution alignment. In particular, real data-driven synthetic
classification is imposed into the loss to enhance the quality of the
low-frequency components. On five image and speech datasets, FedFD achieves
superior performance than state-of-the-art methods while reducing communication
costs. For example, on the CIFAR-10 dataset with Dirichlet coefficient $\alpha
= 0.01$, FedFD achieves a minimum reduction of 37.78\% in the communication
cost, while attaining a 10.88\% performance gain.

Abstract: Detecting anomalies in time series data is essential for the reliable
operation of many real-world systems. Recently, time series foundation models
(TSFMs) have emerged as a powerful tool for anomaly detection. However,
existing methods typically rely on the final layer's representations of TSFMs,
computing the anomaly score as a reconstruction or forecasting error via a
task-specific head. Instead, we propose TimeRep, a novel anomaly detection
approach that leverages the intermediate layer's representations of TSFMs,
computing the anomaly score as the distance between these representations.
Given a pre-trained TSFM, TimeRep selects the intermediate layer and
patch-token position that yield the most informative representation. TimeRep
forms a reference collection of intermediate representations from the training
data and applies a core-set strategy to reduce its size while maintaining
distributional coverage. During inference, TimeRep computes the anomaly score
for incoming data by measuring the distance between its intermediate
representations and those of the collection. To address concept drift, TimeRep
integrates an adaptation mechanism that, at inference time, augments the
collection exclusively with non-redundant intermediate representations from
incoming data. We conducted extensive experiments on the UCR Anomaly Archive,
which contains 250 univariate time series. TimeRep consistently outperforms a
broad spectrum of state-of-the-art baselines, including non-DL, DL, and
foundation model-based methods.

TL;DR: 本文提出实例级随机化(ILR)方法来解决大语言模型评估中的不稳定性问题，通过为每个实例随机化所有影响因素并多次实验取平均，减少评估方差和提升模型比较的公平性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型评估存在不稳定性问题，随机因素（如few-shot示例）的微小变化会导致评分大幅波动甚至模型排名变化。不同模型对特定随机因素设置有不同偏好，固定设置可能导致不公平比较。

Method: 提出实例级随机化(ILR)方法：为每个测试实例随机化所有影响评估得分的因素，进行多次实验并报告平均得分，而不是在整个基准测试中使用固定设置。

Result: 理论分析和实证结果表明，ILR能够减少随机因素引起的方差和不公平比较，并以不到一半的计算成本达到与先前方法相似的鲁棒性水平。

Conclusion: ILR方法有效解决了LLM评估中的不稳定性问题，通过随机化和平均化策略显著提高了评估的稳定性和公平性，同时降低了计算成本。

Abstract: Evaluations of large language models (LLMs) suffer from instability, where
small changes of random factors such as few-shot examples can lead to drastic
fluctuations of scores and even model rankings. Moreover, different LLMs can
have different preferences for a certain setting of random factors. As a
result, using a fixed setting of random factors, which is often adopted as the
paradigm of current evaluations, can lead to potential unfair comparisons
between LLMs. To mitigate the volatility of evaluations, we first theoretically
analyze the sources of variance induced by changes in random factors. Targeting
these specific sources, we then propose the instance-level randomization (ILR)
method to reduce variance and enhance fairness in model comparisons. Instead of
using a fixed setting across the whole benchmark in a single experiment, we
randomize all factors that affect evaluation scores for every single instance,
run multiple experiments and report the averaged score. Theoretical analyses
and empirical results demonstrate that ILR can reduce the variance and unfair
comparisons caused by random factors, as well as achieve similar robustness
level with less than half computational cost compared with previous methods.

Motivation: 随着神经量子态越来越多地采用基于大语言模型的组件，研究NQS的缩放规律有助于理解其可扩展性和最优性能-资源权衡。

Method: 通过识别transformer-based NQS在二次量子化量子化学应用中的性能缩放规律，分析绝对误差和V-score随问题规模的变化，并进行计算约束优化。

Result: 发现模型大小与训练时间的关系高度依赖于损失度量和ansatz选择，不遵循语言模型中近似线性的关系。

Conclusion: 神经量子态的缩放规律与语言模型存在显著差异，需要针对特定应用场景进行优化策略设计。

Abstract: Scaling laws have been used to describe how large language model (LLM)
performance scales with model size, training data size, or amount of
computational resources. Motivated by the fact that neural quantum states (NQS)
has increasingly adopted LLM-based components, we seek to understand NQS
scaling laws, thereby shedding light on the scalability and optimal
performance--resource trade-offs of NQS ansatze. In particular, we identify
scaling laws that predict the performance, as measured by absolute error and
V-score, for transformer-based NQS as a function of problem size in
second-quantized quantum chemistry applications. By performing analogous
compute-constrained optimization of the obtained parametric curves, we find
that the relationship between model size and training time is highly dependent
on loss metric and ansatz, and does not follow the approximately linear
relationship found for language models.

TL;DR: ZTree是一个基于假设检验的新型决策树学习框架，用统计原理的子组识别替代传统CART的纯度分裂方法，通过交叉验证控制多重检验，仅需一个参数（z阈值）即可控制树复杂度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统CART决策树基于纯度分裂缺乏统计理论基础，且需要复杂的剪枝过程和多个参数调优。ZTree旨在提供统计上更严谨、参数更简单、更易解释的决策树框架。

Method: 在每个节点使用假设检验（z检验、t检验、Mann-Whitney U、log-rank等）评估候选子组与补集的差异显著性，采用交叉验证方法处理多重检验问题，通过单一z阈值参数控制分裂停止。

Result: 在五个大规模UCI数据集上的实证评估显示，ZTree在低数据量情况下表现优异，相比CART能生成更简单的树而不牺牲性能。

Conclusion: ZTree提供了一个统计基础更坚实的决策树替代方案，通过假设检验和交叉验证的多重检验校正，实现了高效灵活且参数直观的树学习框架。

Abstract: Decision trees are a commonly used class of machine learning models valued
for their interpretability and versatility, capable of both classification and
regression. We propose ZTree, a novel decision tree learning framework that
replaces CART's traditional purity based splitting with statistically
principled subgroup identification. At each node, ZTree applies hypothesis
testing (e.g., z-tests, t-tests, Mann-Whitney U, log-rank) to assess whether a
candidate subgroup differs meaningfully from the complement. To adjust for the
complication of multiple testing, we employ a cross-validation-based approach
to determine if further node splitting is needed. This robust stopping
criterion eliminates the need for post-pruning and makes the test threshold
(z-threshold) the only parameter for controlling tree complexity. Because of
the simplicity of the tree growing procedure, once a detailed tree is learned
using the most lenient z-threshold, all simpler trees can be derived by simply
removing nodes that do not meet the larger z-thresholds. This makes parameter
tuning intuitive and efficient. Furthermore, this z-threshold is essentially a
p-value, allowing users to easily plug in appropriate statistical tests into
our framework without adjusting the range of parameter search. Empirical
evaluation on five large-scale UCI datasets demonstrates that ZTree
consistently delivers strong performance, especially at low data regimes.
Compared to CART, ZTree also tends to grow simpler trees without sacrificing
performance. ZTree introduces a statistically grounded alternative to
traditional decision tree splitting by leveraging hypothesis testing and a
cross-validation approach to multiple testing correction, resulting in an
efficient and flexible framework.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了Soft Graph Transformer (SGT)用于MIMO检测，结合了图结构感知和软输入软输出机制，接近最大似然性能并超越现有Transformer方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统最大似然检测计算复杂度太高，消息传递算法依赖不现实的假设，而现有Transformer方法无法利用MIMO因子图结构和解码器软信息

Method: 将消息传递直接集成到图感知注意力机制中，通过软输入嵌入支持解码器信息更新，实现有效的软输出生成

Result: 作为独立检测器，SGT接近最大似然性能，超越之前的Transformer方法

Conclusion: SGT成功克服了现有方法的局限性，在保持计算效率的同时实现了优异的检测性能

Abstract: We propose the Soft Graph Transformer (SGT), a Soft-Input-Soft-Output neural
architecture tailored for MIMO detection. While Maximum Likelihood (ML)
detection achieves optimal accuracy, its prohibitive exponential complexity
renders it impractical for real-world systems. Conventional message passing
algorithms offer tractable alternatives but rely on large-system asymptotics
and random matrix assumptions, both of which break down under practical
implementations. Prior Transformer-based detectors, on the other hand, fail to
incorporate the MIMO factor graph structure and cannot utilize decoder-side
soft information, limiting their standalone performance and their applicability
in iterative detection-decoding (IDD). To overcome these limitations, SGT
integrates message passing directly into a graph-aware attention mechanism and
supports decoder-informed updates through soft-input embeddings. This design
enables effective soft-output generation while preserving computational
efficiency. As a standalone detector, SGT closely approaches ML performance and
surpasses prior Transformer-based approaches.

*Yiyuan Yang,Guodong Long,Qinghua Lu,Liming Zhu,Jing Jiang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种双层个性化联邦学习框架，用于在基础模型上进行联邦微调，通过客户端个性化微调和基于任务向量的服务器端个性化聚合来解决小规模用户群体的个性化与联邦学习之间的平衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦基础模型需要在小规模新用户或专业场景下进行微调，这些场景数据有限，个性化与联邦学习之间的权衡变得更加敏感，需要解决非IID数据下相关用户信息利用和干扰用户排除的问题。

Method: 采用双层个性化框架：客户端使用私有数据进行个性化微调，服务器端使用基于客户端特定任务向量测量的相似用户进行个性化聚合，从而获得群体层面的个性化信息并减少不相关或利益冲突客户的干扰。

Result: 在基准数据集上的广泛实验分析证明了所提出算法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该双层个性化框架能够有效解决联邦基础模型在小规模用户群体微调时的个性化与联邦学习平衡问题，通过客户端和服务器端的双重个性化处理提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Federated foundation models represent a new paradigm to jointly fine-tune
pre-trained foundation models across clients. It is still a challenge to
fine-tune foundation models for a small group of new users or specialized
scenarios, which typically involve limited data compared to the large-scale
data used in pre-training. In this context, the trade-off between
personalization and federation becomes more sensitive. To tackle these, we
proposed a bi-level personalization framework for federated fine-tuning on
foundation models. Specifically, we conduct personalized fine-tuning on the
client-level using its private data, and then conduct a personalized
aggregation on the server-level using similar users measured by client-specific
task vectors. Given the personalization information gained from client-level
fine-tuning, the server-level personalized aggregation can gain group-wise
personalization information while mitigating the disturbance of irrelevant or
interest-conflict clients with non-IID data. The effectiveness of the proposed
algorithm has been demonstrated by extensive experimental analysis in benchmark
datasets.

Motivation: 慢性肾病早期检测在门诊环境中具有挑战性，因为实验室肾脏生物标志物往往不可用，需要探索常规收集的非肾脏临床变量的预测潜力。

Method: 提出NORA方法，结合监督对比学习和非线性随机森林分类器，首先从表格化电子健康记录数据中提取判别性患者表示，然后用于下游CKD分类。

Result: NORA提高了类别可分性和整体分类性能，特别是增强了早期CKD的F1分数，并在不同患者队列中展示了良好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: NORA方法能够有效利用常规非肾脏临床变量进行慢性肾病风险分层，为门诊环境中的早期检测提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) affects millions of people worldwide, yet its
early detection remains challenging, especially in outpatient settings where
laboratory-based renal biomarkers are often unavailable. In this work, we
investigate the predictive potential of routinely collected non-renal clinical
variables for CKD classification, including sociodemographic factors, comorbid
conditions, and urinalysis findings. We introduce the Nephrology-Oriented
Representation leArning (NORA) approach, which combines supervised contrastive
learning with a nonlinear Random Forest classifier. NORA first derives
discriminative patient representations from tabular EHR data, which are then
used for downstream CKD classification. We evaluated NORA on a clinic-based EHR
dataset from Riverside Nephrology Physicians. Our results demonstrated that
NORA improves class separability and overall classification performance,
particularly enhancing the F1-score for early-stage CKD. Additionally, we
assessed the generalizability of NORA on the UCI CKD dataset, demonstrating its
effectiveness for CKD risk stratification across distinct patient cohorts.

### [175] [Unbiased Online Curvature Approximation for Regularized Graph Continual Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12727)
*Jie Yin,Ke Sun,Han Wu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个基于Fisher信息矩阵的图持续学习通用正则化框架，并开发了一种新的在线曲率近似方法，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的图持续学习方法（如EWC）使用对角近似的Fisher信息矩阵，存在局限性。需要更好的方法来防止灾难性遗忘，特别是在无回放、类增量设置中。

Method: 建立基于Fisher信息矩阵诱导的弯曲参数空间的通用正则化框架，提出基于模型当前学习状态的无偏在线曲率近似方法，直接在线估计正则化项而不显式计算和存储Fisher信息矩阵。

Result: 在三个图数据集上的大量实验表明，该方法显著优于现有的基于正则化的方法，在稳定性（保留旧知识）和可塑性（获取新知识）之间实现了更好的平衡。

Conclusion: 提出的在线曲率近似方法能够更好地捕捉学习新任务时的损失景观，同时保留从先前任务中学到的知识，为图持续学习提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Graph continual learning (GCL) aims to learn from a continuous sequence of
graph-based tasks. Regularization methods are vital for preventing catastrophic
forgetting in GCL, particularly in the challenging replay-free,
class-incremental setting, where each task consists of a set of unique classes.
In this work, we first establish a general regularization framework for GCL
based on the curved parameter space induced by the Fisher information matrix
(FIM). We show that the dominant Elastic Weight Consolidation (EWC) and its
variants are a special case within this framework, using a diagonal
approximation of the empirical FIM based on parameters from previous tasks. To
overcome their limitations, we propose a new unbiased online curvature
approximation of the full FIM based on the model's current learning state. Our
method directly estimates the regularization term in an online manner without
explicitly evaluating and storing the FIM itself. This enables the model to
better capture the loss landscape during learning new tasks while retaining the
knowledge learned from previous tasks. Extensive experiments on three graph
datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing
regularization-based methods, achieving a superior trade-off between stability
(retaining old knowledge) and plasticity (acquiring new knowledge).

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合图机器学习和网络分析的方法，通过四步预处理框架和Graph Autoencoders来检测金融交易图中的拓扑模式，以改进复杂金融犯罪行为的检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数字生态系统的发展使金融部门面临不断演变的滥用和犯罪策略，传统基于规则的系统缺乏检测复杂或协同犯罪行为的适应性，需要分析参与者互动来发现可疑活动。

Method: 四步预处理框架：提取图结构、考虑数据时间性管理大节点集、检测社区、应用自动标注策略生成弱标签；然后实现三种不同的Graph Autoencoder变体来区分已知拓扑模式。

Result: 初步结果表明，这种以模式为中心、拓扑驱动的方法能有效检测复杂金融犯罪方案，为传统基于规则的检测系统提供了有前景的替代方案。

Conclusion: 该方法通过图机器学习和网络分析的结合，解决了传统金融数据集稀疏和未标注的限制，为检测复杂金融犯罪行为提供了有效的技术路径。

Abstract: The rise of digital ecosystems has exposed the financial sector to evolving
abuse and criminal tactics that share operational knowledge and techniques both
within and across different environments (fiat-based, crypto-assets, etc.).
Traditional rule-based systems lack the adaptability needed to detect
sophisticated or coordinated criminal behaviors (patterns), highlighting the
need for strategies that analyze actors' interactions to uncover suspicious
activities and extract their modus operandi. For this reason, in this work, we
propose an approach that integrates graph machine learning and network analysis
to improve the detection of well-known topological patterns within
transactional graphs. However, a key challenge lies in the limitations of
traditional financial datasets, which often provide sparse, unlabeled
information that is difficult to use for graph-based pattern analysis.
Therefore, we firstly propose a four-step preprocessing framework that involves
(i) extracting graph structures, (ii) considering data temporality to manage
large node sets, (iii) detecting communities within, and (iv) applying
automatic labeling strategies to generate weak ground-truth labels. Then, once
the data is processed, Graph Autoencoders are implemented to distinguish among
the well-known topological patterns. Specifically, three different GAE variants
are implemented and compared in this analysis. Preliminary results show that
this pattern-focused, topology-driven method is effective for detecting complex
financial crime schemes, offering a promising alternative to conventional
rule-based detection systems.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于AI的端到端通路分析框架，使用时间序列机器学习模型预测癌症严重程度和突变进展，并推荐治疗方案，无需依赖耗时的手动湿实验室数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 癌症是美国第二大死因，每年导致超过60万人死亡。现有的通路分析领域依赖于手动获取的湿实验室数据，耗时且效率低下。需要开发更高效、成本更低的AI方法来预测癌症进展和推荐治疗。

Method: 1) 从TCGA数据库分离突变序列；2) 使用新颖的预处理算法按突变频率过滤关键突变；3) 将数据输入RNN预测癌症严重程度；4) 结合RNN预测、预处理信息和多个药物靶点数据库，概率性地预测未来突变并推荐治疗方案。

Conclusion: 这是首个提出高效、成本效益的端到端框架的工作，能够在不需要昂贵耗时的湿实验室工作的情况下预测癌症进展并提供可能的治疗方案，为癌症诊断和治疗推荐提供了新的AI解决方案。

Abstract: Despite significant medical advancements, cancer remains the second leading
cause of death, with over 600,000 deaths per year in the US. One emerging
field, pathway analysis, is promising but still relies on manually derived wet
lab data, which is time-consuming to acquire. This work proposes an efficient,
effective end-to-end framework for Artificial Intelligence (AI) based pathway
analysis that predicts both cancer severity and mutation progression, thus
recommending possible treatments. The proposed technique involves a novel
combination of time-series machine learning models and pathway analysis. First,
mutation sequences were isolated from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Database.
Then, a novel preprocessing algorithm was used to filter key mutations by
mutation frequency. This data was fed into a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)
that predicted cancer severity. Then, the model probabilistically used the RNN
predictions, information from the preprocessing algorithm, and multiple
drug-target databases to predict future mutations and recommend possible
treatments. This framework achieved robust results and Receiver Operating
Characteristic (ROC) curves (a key statistical metric) with accuracies greater
than 60%, similar to existing cancer diagnostics. In addition, preprocessing
played an instrumental role in isolating important mutations, demonstrating
that each cancer stage studied may contain on the order of a few-hundred key
driver mutations, consistent with current research. Heatmaps based on predicted
gene frequency were also generated, highlighting key mutations in each cancer.
Overall, this work is the first to propose an efficient, cost-effective
end-to-end framework for projecting cancer progression and providing possible
treatments without relying on expensive, time-consuming wet lab work.

TL;DR: 提出了SDM激活函数，在标准softmax基础上增加了相似性和距离感知，提高了神经网络的鲁棒性和可解释性，特别适用于选择性分类任务。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准softmax激活函数在处理协变量偏移和分布外输入时缺乏鲁棒性，且可解释性不足。需要一种能够同时考虑输出幅度、相似性和距离分布的新激活函数。

Method: 在softmax基础上引入相似性感知（正确预测的深度匹配）和距离训练分布感知，形成相似性-距离-幅度（SDM）激活函数。通过密集匹配提供基于范例的可解释性。

Result: SDM激活函数比softmax对协变量偏移和分布外输入更鲁棒，在高概率区域表现更好。能够对类别经验CDF进行分区，防止选择性分类中的低类别召回率。

Conclusion: SDM激活函数在选择性分类任务中优于softmax，即使考虑后校准方法，仍表现出更好的鲁棒性和可解释性，是softmax的有力替代方案。

Abstract: We introduce a more robust and interpretable formulation of the standard
softmax activation function commonly used with neural networks by adding
Similarity (i.e., correctly predicted depth-matches into training) awareness
and Distance-to-training-distribution awareness to the existing output
Magnitude (i.e., decision-boundary) awareness. When used as the final-layer
activation with language models, the resulting Similarity-Distance-Magnitude
(SDM) activation function is more robust than the softmax function to
co-variate shifts and out-of-distribution inputs in high-probability regions,
and provides interpretability-by-exemplar via dense matching. Complementing the
prediction-conditional estimates, the SDM activation enables a partitioning of
the class-wise empirical CDFs to guard against low class-wise recall among
selective classifications. These properties make it preferable for selective
classification, even when considering post-hoc calibration methods over the
softmax.

article introduces EmbeddedML, a training-time-optimized and mathematically
enhanced machine learning library. The speed was increased by approximately
times compared to scikit-learn without any loss in terms of accuracy in
regression models such as Multiple Linear Regression. Logistic Regression and
Support Vector Machines (SVM) algorithms have been mathematically rewritten to
reduce training time and increase accuracy in classification models. With the
applied mathematical improvements, training time has been reduced by
approximately 2 times for SVM on small datasets and by around 800 times on
large datasets, and by approximately 4 times for Logistic Regression, compared
to the scikit-learn implementation. In summary, the EmbeddedML library offers
regression, classification, clustering, and dimensionality reduction algorithms
that are mathematically rewritten and optimized to reduce training time.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a promising paradigm for enabling
collaborative machine learning while preserving data privacy, making it
particularly suitable for Internet of Things (IoT) environments. However,
resource-constrained IoT devices face significant challenges due to limited
energy,unreliable communication channels, and the impracticality of assuming
infinite blocklength transmission. This paper proposes a federated learning
framework for IoT networks that integrates finite blocklength transmission,
model quantization, and an error-aware aggregation mechanism to enhance energy
efficiency and communication reliability. The framework also optimizes uplink
transmission power to balance energy savings and model performance. Simulation
results demonstrate that the proposed approach significantly reduces energy
consumption by up to 75\% compared to a standard FL model, while maintaining
robust model accuracy, making it a viable solution for FL in real-world IoT
scenarios with constrained resources. This work paves the way for efficient and
reliable FL implementations in practical IoT deployments. Index Terms:

Conclusion: 研究结果为根据任务特性选择和优化基于投影的安全RL方法提供了可行的见解，表明两种方法在适当改进后都能取得良好性能。

Abstract: Projection-based safety filters, which modify unsafe actions by mapping them
to the closest safe alternative, are widely used to enforce safety constraints
in reinforcement learning (RL). Two integration strategies are commonly
considered: Safe environment RL (SE-RL), where the safeguard is treated as part
of the environment, and safe policy RL (SP-RL), where it is embedded within the
policy through differentiable optimization layers. Despite their practical
relevance in safety-critical settings, a formal understanding of their
differences is lacking. In this work, we present a theoretical comparison of
SE-RL and SP-RL. We identify a key distinction in how each approach is affected
by action aliasing, a phenomenon in which multiple unsafe actions are projected
to the same safe action, causing information loss in the policy gradients. In
SE-RL, this effect is implicitly approximated by the critic, while in SP-RL, it
manifests directly as rank-deficient Jacobians during backpropagation through
the safeguard. Our contributions are threefold: (i) a unified formalization of
SE-RL and SP-RL in the context of actor-critic algorithms, (ii) a theoretical
analysis of their respective policy gradient estimates, highlighting the role
of action aliasing, and (iii) a comparative study of mitigation strategies,
including a novel penalty-based improvement for SP-RL that aligns with
established SE-RL practices. Empirical results support our theoretical
predictions, showing that action aliasing is more detrimental for SP-RL than
for SE-RL. However, with appropriate improvement strategies, SP-RL can match or
outperform improved SE-RL across a range of environments. These findings
provide actionable insights for choosing and refining projection-based safe RL
methods based on task characteristics.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in
language understanding and reasoning, yet they remain limited when tackling
real-world tasks that require up-to-date knowledge, precise operations, or
specialized tool use. To address this, we propose Tool-R1, a reinforcement
learning framework that enables LLMs to perform general, compositional, and
multi-step tool use by generating executable Python code. Tool-R1 supports
integration of user-defined tools and standard libraries, with variable sharing
across steps to construct coherent workflows. An outcome-based reward function,
combining LLM-based answer judgment and code execution success, guides policy
optimization. To improve training efficiency, we maintain a dynamic sample
queue to cache and reuse high-quality trajectories, reducing the overhead of
costly online sampling. Experiments on the GAIA benchmark show that Tool-R1
substantially improves both accuracy and robustness, achieving about 10\% gain
over strong baselines, with larger improvements on complex multi-step tasks.
These results highlight the potential of Tool-R1 for enabling reliable and
efficient tool-augmented reasoning in real-world applications. Our code will be

TL;DR: TimeCluster是一种可视化分析技术，通过将多变量时间序列的滑动窗口投影到低维空间来发现结构。研究发现当使用PCA作为降维技术时，该方法在数学上等同于经典的线性子空间识别方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索TimeCluster可视化技术与传统子空间系统识别方法之间的数学等价性，为时间序列分析提供新的理论联系和应用可能性。

Method: 通过数学推导证明TimeCluster的滑动窗口矩阵形成Hankel矩阵，应用PCA（通过SVD）可恢复与子空间识别相同的主方向，并在合成和真实动态信号上进行实验验证。

Result: 实验证实两种嵌入方法完全一致，TimeCluster的聚类坐标与子空间识别方法重合。

Conclusion: 建立了TimeCluster与子空间系统识别的数学等价性，为时间序列分析开辟了新的应用方向，包括状态空间预测、流式处理、外部输入整合和鲁棒趋势可视化等。

Abstract: TimeCluster is a visual analytics technique for discovering structure in long
multivariate time series by projecting overlapping windows of data into a
low-dimensional space. We show that, when Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is
chosen as the dimensionality reduction technique, this procedure is
mathematically equivalent to classical linear subspace identification
(block-Hankel matrix plus Singular Vector Decomposition (SVD)). In both
approaches, the same low-dimensional linear subspace is extracted from the time
series data. We first review the TimeCluster method and the theory of subspace
system identification. Then we show that forming the sliding-window matrix of a
time series yields a Hankel matrix, so applying PCA (via SVD) to this matrix
recovers the same principal directions as subspace identification. Thus the
cluster coordinates from TimeCluster coincide with the subspace identification
methods. We present experiments on synthetic and real dynamical signals
confirming that the two embeddings coincide. Finally, we explore and discuss
future opportunities enabled by this equivalence, including forecasting from
the identified state space, streaming/online extensions, incorporating and
visualising external inputs and robust techniques for displaying underlying
trends in corrupted data.

TL;DR: 提出了可逆深度平衡模型（RevDEQs），解决了传统DEQs梯度计算近似的问题，实现了精确梯度计算，在语言建模和图像分类任务上达到SOTA性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统深度平衡模型（DEQs）虽然通过单层多次迭代优于显式模型，但其梯度计算是近似的，导致训练不稳定，需要正则化或大量函数评估

Method: 引入可逆深度平衡模型（RevDEQs），通过可逆性设计实现精确梯度计算，无需正则化，且函数评估次数大幅减少

Result: RevDEQs在语言建模和图像分类任务上相比同类隐式和显式模型取得了最先进的性能表现

Conclusion: 可逆深度平衡模型通过精确梯度计算解决了传统DEQs的训练稳定性问题，在保持性能优势的同时显著提升了训练效率

Abstract: Deep Equilibrium Models (DEQs) are an interesting class of implicit model
where the model output is implicitly defined as the fixed point of a learned
function. These models have been shown to outperform explicit (fixed-depth)
models in large-scale tasks by trading many deep layers for a single layer that
is iterated many times. However, gradient calculation through DEQs is
approximate. This often leads to unstable training dynamics and requires
regularisation or many function evaluations to fix. Here, we introduce
Reversible Deep Equilibrium Models (RevDEQs) that allow for exact gradient
calculation, no regularisation and far fewer function evaluations than DEQs. We
show that RevDEQs achieve state-of-the-art performance on language modelling
and image classification tasks against comparable implicit and explicit models.

TL;DR: 提出了一种软梯度提升框架，在提升过程中嵌入可学习的线性特征变换，特别适用于高维数据稀缺场景，能同时优化特征选择和提升过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决高维、数据稀缺场景下的回归问题，通过端到端优化特征变换和提升过程来提高性能并避免过拟合。

Method: 在每个提升迭代中训练软决策树并学习线性输入特征变换Q，可扩展到可微分非线性变换。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上证明该方法能有效提升性能，实现特征选择/变换和提升的端到端优化。

Conclusion: 该方法在高维数据稀缺场景下表现优异，代码已公开以支持可重现性和未来工作。

Abstract: We propose a soft gradient boosting framework for sequential regression that
embeds a learnable linear feature transform within the boosting procedure. At
each boosting iteration, we train a soft decision tree and learn a linear input
feature transform Q together. This approach is particularly advantageous in
high-dimensional, data-scarce scenarios, as it discovers the most relevant
input representations while boosting. We demonstrate, using both synthetic and
real-world datasets, that our method effectively and efficiently increases the
performance by an end-to-end optimization of feature selection/transform and
boosting while avoiding overfitting. We also extend our algorithm to
differentiable non-linear transforms if overfitting is not a problem. To
support reproducibility and future work, we share our code publicly.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一个统一的评估框架来比较PPO、DPO、ORPO、KTO等LLM对齐方法在事实性、安全性、简洁性、主动性和多样性五个维度上的表现，发现不同方法在不同维度各有优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注单一技术或特定维度，缺乏对LLM对齐方法内在权衡的整体评估，需要建立一个全面的评估框架来指导更平衡可靠的LLM开发。

Method: 使用统一的评估框架，在分布内和分布外数据集上比较PPO、DPO、ORPO、KTO等对齐方法，采用经过人工研究验证的LLM-as-Judge提示进行评估。

Result: DPO和KTO在事实准确性方面表现最佳，PPO和DPO在安全性方面领先，PPO在简洁性与主动性的平衡方面表现最好。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了常见对齐方法的内在权衡，为开发更平衡可靠的LLM提供了重要指导，不同方法在不同维度各有优势，需要根据具体需求选择合适的方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) require careful alignment to balance competing
objectives - factuality, safety, conciseness, proactivity, and diversity.
Existing studies focus on individual techniques or specific dimensions, lacking
a holistic assessment of the inherent trade-offs. We propose a unified
evaluation framework that compares LLM alignment methods (PPO, DPO, ORPO, KTO)
across these five axes, using both in-distribution and out-of-distribution
datasets. Leveraging a specialized LLM-as-Judge prompt, validated through human
studies, we reveal that DPO and KTO excel in factual accuracy, PPO and DPO lead
in safety, and PPO best balances conciseness with proactivity. Our findings
provide insights into trade-offs of common alignment methods, guiding the
development of more balanced and reliable LLMs.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了Sy-FAR方法，通过追求对称性而非完美公平性来提升对抗性鲁棒性，在面部识别等安全关键系统中显著改善了公平对抗鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的对抗性鲁棒性方法通常导致不公平的鲁棒性——某些类别或群体更容易受到攻击。在现实世界的公平关键任务中，实现完美公平往往不可行，因此需要更可行的对称性方法。

Method: 开发了Sy-FAR技术，通过鼓励对称性来优化对抗鲁棒性，即确保从类别i到j的攻击成功率与从j到i的攻击成功率相同。

Result: 在五个数据集和三种模型架构上的广泛评估显示，Sy-FAR相比最先进方法显著提高了公平对抗鲁棒性，运行速度更快且结果更一致，同时减少了目标类别的脆弱性。

Conclusion: 对称性是比完美公平性更可行的目标，Sy-FAR方法在提升对抗鲁棒性的同时有效改善了公平性，特别是在安全关键系统中表现出色。

Abstract: Security-critical machine-learning (ML) systems, such as face-recognition
systems, are susceptible to adversarial examples, including real-world
physically realizable attacks. Various means to boost ML's adversarial
robustness have been proposed; however, they typically induce unfair
robustness: It is often easier to attack from certain classes or groups than
from others. Several techniques have been developed to improve adversarial
robustness while seeking perfect fairness between classes. Yet, prior work has
focused on settings where security and fairness are less critical. Our insight
is that achieving perfect parity in realistic fairness-critical tasks, such as
face recognition, is often infeasible -- some classes may be highly similar,
leading to more misclassifications between them. Instead, we suggest that
seeking symmetry -- i.e., attacks from class $i$ to $j$ would be as successful
as from $j$ to $i$ -- is more tractable. Intuitively, symmetry is a desirable
because class resemblance is a symmetric relation in most domains.
Additionally, as we prove theoretically, symmetry between individuals induces
symmetry between any set of sub-groups, in contrast to other fairness notions
where group-fairness is often elusive. We develop Sy-FAR, a technique to
encourage symmetry while also optimizing adversarial robustness and extensively
evaluate it using five datasets, with three model architectures, including
against targeted and untargeted realistic attacks. The results show Sy-FAR
significantly improves fair adversarial robustness compared to state-of-the-art
methods. Moreover, we find that Sy-FAR is faster and more consistent across
runs. Notably, Sy-FAR also ameliorates another type of unfairness we discover
in this work -- target classes that adversarial examples are likely to be
classified into become significantly less vulnerable after inducing symmetry.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于概率框架的结构化时空动力学建模方法，整合神经ODE、图神经网络和神经过程，用于从稀疏观测中重建和预测心脏运动


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决从稀疏观测数据中建模结构化时空动力学的问题，特别是在心脏运动分析中需要同时处理不确定性、时间连续性和解剖结构信息

Method: 使用时空多重图表示动态系统，通过GNN参数化的向量场建模潜在轨迹，基于节点和边级别的稀疏上下文观测推断潜在初始状态和控制变量的分布

Result: 在三个合成动力系统和两个真实心脏影像数据集上验证，能够准确重建轨迹并从单周期观测外推未来心脏周期，在ACDC分类任务达到99%准确率，UK Biobank房颤检测达到67%准确率

Conclusion: 该方法为分析心脏运动提供了灵活框架，为基于图的结构化生物医学时空序列数据学习奠定了基础

Abstract: We present a probabilistic framework for modeling structured spatiotemporal
dynamics from sparse observations, focusing on cardiac motion. Our approach
integrates neural ordinary differential equations (NODEs), graph neural
networks (GNNs), and neural processes into a unified model that captures
uncertainty, temporal continuity, and anatomical structure. We represent
dynamic systems as spatiotemporal multiplex graphs and model their latent
trajectories using a GNN-parameterized vector field. Given the sparse context
observations at node and edge levels, the model infers a distribution over
latent initial states and control variables, enabling both interpolation and
extrapolation of trajectories. We validate the method on three synthetic
dynamical systems (coupled pendulum, Lorenz attractor, and Kuramoto
oscillators) and two real-world cardiac imaging datasets - ACDC (N=150) and UK
Biobank (N=526) - demonstrating accurate reconstruction, extrapolation, and
disease classification capabilities. The model accurately reconstructs
trajectories and extrapolates future cardiac cycles from a single observed
cycle. It achieves state-of-the-art results on the ACDC classification task (up
to 99% accuracy), and detects atrial fibrillation in UK Biobank subjects with
competitive performance (up to 67% accuracy). This work introduces a flexible
approach for analyzing cardiac motion and offers a foundation for graph-based
learning in structured biomedical spatiotemporal time-series data.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了BAPFL，这是首个专门针对原型联邦学习(PFL)框架的后门攻击方法，通过原型投毒策略和触发器优化机制，在保持主任务准确性的同时，攻击成功率比传统方法提高35%-75%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 原型联邦学习(PFL)因其利用均值特征向量作为原型来增强模型泛化能力而成为解决联邦学习中数据异构性问题的有前景范式，但其对后门攻击的鲁棒性尚未得到充分探索。

Method: BAPFL整合了原型投毒策略和触发器优化机制。原型投毒策略操纵全局原型轨迹误导良性客户端的原型训练；触发器优化机制为每个潜在目标标签学习独特且隐蔽的触发器，并引导触发器嵌入样本的原型与目标标签的全局原型对齐。

Result: 在多个数据集和PFL变体上的实验结果表明，BAPFL相比传统后门攻击在攻击成功率上实现了35%-75%的提升，同时保持了主任务准确性。

Conclusion: BAPFL在PFL中展现出高效性、隐蔽性和适应性，揭示了PFL框架在面对专门设计的后门攻击时的潜在安全风险。

Abstract: Prototype-based federated learning (PFL) has emerged as a promising paradigm
to address data heterogeneity problems in federated learning, as it leverages
mean feature vectors as prototypes to enhance model generalization. However,
its robustness against backdoor attacks remains largely unexplored. In this
paper, we identify that PFL is inherently resistant to existing backdoor
attacks due to its unique prototype learning mechanism and local data
heterogeneity. To further explore the security of PFL, we propose BAPFL, the
first backdoor attack method specifically designed for PFL frameworks. BAPFL
integrates a prototype poisoning strategy with a trigger optimization
mechanism. The prototype poisoning strategy manipulates the trajectories of
global prototypes to mislead the prototype training of benign clients, pushing
their local prototypes of clean samples away from the prototypes of
trigger-embedded samples. Meanwhile, the trigger optimization mechanism learns
a unique and stealthy trigger for each potential target label, and guides the
prototypes of trigger-embedded samples to align closely with the global
prototype of the target label. Experimental results across multiple datasets
and PFL variants demonstrate that BAPFL achieves a 35\%-75\% improvement in
attack success rate compared to traditional backdoor attacks, while preserving
main task accuracy. These results highlight the effectiveness, stealthiness,
and adaptability of BAPFL in PFL.

*Yikang Chen,Xingzhe Sun,Dehui Du*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于分位数部分效应(QPE)的因果发现方法，通过分析观测分布的形状不对称性来识别因果方向，无需考虑噪声机制或马尔可夫假设。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统功能因果模型(FCMs)需要假设特定的噪声机制，而QPE方法直接在观测层面利用分布形状的不对称性进行因果识别，具有更好的普适性。

Method: 通过假设因果对效应的QPE位于有限线性空间中，进行基函数检验来区分因果方向；多变量情况下利用QPE与得分函数的联系，使用Fisher信息确定因果顺序。

Result: 在大量双变量因果发现数据集上实验证明有效；在多变量合成和真实数据集上验证了使用Fisher信息识别因果顺序的可行性。

Conclusion: QPE方法提供了一种新的因果发现框架，直接从观测分布的形状特性中提取因果信息，突破了传统FCMs的限制，在理论和实验上都展现了良好的性能。

Abstract: Quantile Partial Effect (QPE) is a statistic associated with conditional
quantile regression, measuring the effect of covariates at different levels.
Our theory demonstrates that when the QPE of cause on effect is assumed to lie
in a finite linear span, cause and effect are identifiable from their
observational distribution. This generalizes previous identifiability results
based on Functional Causal Models (FCMs) with additive, heteroscedastic noise,
etc. Meanwhile, since QPE resides entirely at the observational level, this
parametric assumption does not require considering mechanisms, noise, or even
the Markov assumption, but rather directly utilizes the asymmetry of shape
characteristics in the observational distribution. By performing basis function
tests on the estimated QPE, causal directions can be distinguished, which is
empirically shown to be effective in experiments on a large number of bivariate
causal discovery datasets. For multivariate causal discovery, leveraging the
close connection between QPE and score functions, we find that Fisher
Information is sufficient as a statistical measure to determine causal order
when assumptions are made about the second moment of QPE. We validate the
feasibility of using Fisher Information to identify causal order on multiple
synthetic and real-world multivariate causal discovery datasets.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种简单有效的后训练策略，显著提升了ECG基础模型ECGFounder在PTB-XL基准测试上的性能表现，在AUROC和AUPRC指标上均有显著提升，且具有更好的稳定性和样本效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ECG基础模型虽然在各种任务中具有适应性，但其临床适用性往往受到性能限制，即使在大规模ECG数据集上进行预训练并在目标数据上进行微调后，仍存在性能差距，这主要是由于缺乏有效的后训练策略。

Method: 提出了一种简单的后训练方法，应用于在超过700万条ECG记录上预训练的ECGFounder模型。该方法包含关键组件如随机深度和预览线性探测，通过实验验证了这些组件对性能提升的贡献。

Result: 在PTB-XL基准测试中，该方法相比基线微调策略在宏观AUROC上提升1.2%-3.3%，在宏观AUPRC上提升5.3%-20.9%。使用仅10%的训练数据就能实现宏观AUROC提升9.1%和宏观AUPRC提升34.9%，表现出更好的稳定性和样本效率。

Conclusion: 后训练策略具有显著提升ECG基础模型性能的潜力，这项工作有望推动ECG领域基础模型的持续发展，为临床应用提供更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: ECG foundation models are increasingly popular due to their adaptability
across various tasks. However, their clinical applicability is often limited by
performance gaps compared to task-specific models, even after pre-training on
large ECG datasets and fine-tuning on target data. This limitation is likely
due to the lack of an effective post-training strategy. In this paper, we
propose a simple yet effective post-training approach to enhance ECGFounder, a
state-of-the-art ECG foundation model pre-trained on over 7 million ECG
recordings. Experiments on the PTB-XL benchmark show that our approach improves
the baseline fine-tuning strategy by 1.2%-3.3% in macro AUROC and 5.3%-20.9% in
macro AUPRC. Additionally, our method outperforms several recent
state-of-the-art approaches, including task-specific and advanced
architectures. Further evaluation reveals that our method is more stable and
sample-efficient compared to the baseline, achieving a 9.1% improvement in
macro AUROC and a 34.9% improvement in macro AUPRC using just 10% of the
training data. Ablation studies identify key components, such as stochastic
depth and preview linear probing, that contribute to the enhanced performance.
These findings underscore the potential of post-training strategies to improve
ECG foundation models, and we hope this work will contribute to the continued
development of foundation models in the ECG domain.

Abstract: We present a new method to visualize data ensembles by constructing
structured probabilistic representations in latent spaces, i.e.,
lower-dimensional representations of spatial data features. Our approach
transforms the spatial features of an ensemble into a latent space through
feature space conversion and unsupervised learning using a variational
autoencoder (VAE). The resulting latent spaces follow multivariate standard
Gaussian distributions, enabling analytical computation of confidence intervals
and density estimation of the probabilistic distribution that generates the
data ensemble. Preliminary results on a weather forecasting ensemble
demonstrate the effectiveness and versatility of our method.

Motivation: 扩散模型在生成高质量多样化图像方面表现出色，但存在训练数据记忆化问题，引发隐私和安全担忧。数据遗忘技术可以在不从头重新训练的情况下移除特定数据的影响。

Method: ReTrack采用重要性采样构建更高效的微调损失，通过仅保留主导项来近似该损失，得到一个可解释的目标函数，将去噪轨迹重定向到k近邻，实现高效遗忘。

Result: 在MNIST T-Shirt、CelebA-HQ、CIFAR-10和Stable Diffusion等数据集上的实验表明，ReTrack达到了最先进的性能，在遗忘强度和生成质量保持之间取得了最佳平衡。

Conclusion: ReTrack是一种快速有效的扩散模型数据遗忘方法，通过创新的重要性采样和轨迹重定向技术，成功解决了数据记忆化问题，在保持生成质量的同时实现了高效的数据移除。

Abstract: Diffusion models excel at generating high-quality, diverse images but suffer
from training data memorization, raising critical privacy and safety concerns.
Data unlearning has emerged to mitigate this issue by removing the influence of
specific data without retraining from scratch. We propose ReTrack, a fast and
effective data unlearning method for diffusion models. ReTrack employs
importance sampling to construct a more efficient fine-tuning loss, which we
approximate by retaining only dominant terms. This yields an interpretable
objective that redirects denoising trajectories toward the $k$-nearest
neighbors, enabling efficient unlearning while preserving generative quality.
Experiments on MNIST T-Shirt, CelebA-HQ, CIFAR-10, and Stable Diffusion show
that ReTrack achieves state-of-the-art performance, striking the best trade-off
between unlearning strength and generation quality preservation.

Abstract: Despite the remarkable progress in the synthesis speed and fidelity of neural
vocoders, their high energy consumption remains a critical barrier to practical
deployment on computationally restricted edge devices. Spiking Neural Networks
(SNNs), widely recognized for their high energy efficiency due to their
event-driven nature, offer a promising solution for low-resource scenarios. In
this paper, we propose Spiking Vocos, a novel spiking neural vocoder with
ultra-low energy consumption, built upon the efficient Vocos framework. To
mitigate the inherent information bottleneck in SNNs, we design a Spiking
ConvNeXt module to reduce Multiply-Accumulate (MAC) operations and incorporate
an amplitude shortcut path to preserve crucial signal dynamics. Furthermore, to
bridge the performance gap with its Artificial Neural Network (ANN)
counterpart, we introduce a self-architectural distillation strategy to
effectively transfer knowledge. A lightweight Temporal Shift Module is also
integrated to enhance the model's ability to fuse information across the
temporal dimension with negligible computational overhead. Experiments
demonstrate that our model achieves performance comparable to its ANN
counterpart, with UTMOS and PESQ scores of 3.74 and 3.45 respectively, while
consuming only 14.7% of the energy. The source code is available at

TL;DR: 提出了Traces Propagation (TP)方法，一种前向传播、内存高效、可扩展且完全局部的脉冲神经网络学习规则，解决了时空信用分配问题，无需辅助矩阵，在多个数据集上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决SNN训练中的时空信用分配问题，现有BPTT方法不符合生物神经系统的局部性原理且计算内存需求高，而现有局部学习规则需要辅助矩阵导致内存开销大和可扩展性差。

Method: 结合资格迹和层间对比损失的前向传播学习规则TP，无需辅助层间矩阵，实现完全局部学习。

Result: TP在NMNIST和SHD数据集上优于其他完全局部学习规则，在DVS-GESTURE和DVS-CIFAR10等复杂数据集上表现竞争性，可扩展到VGG-9等深层架构，内存扩展性优于现有方法。

Conclusion: TP为边缘设备上的高效学习提供了可行方案，特别适合实际微调任务如关键词识别。

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) provide an efficient framework for processing
dynamic spatio-temporal signals and for investigating the learning principles
underlying biological neural systems. A key challenge in training SNNs is to
solve both spatial and temporal credit assignment. The dominant approach for
training SNNs is Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT) with surrogate gradients.
However, BPTT is in stark contrast with the spatial and temporal locality
observed in biological neural systems and leads to high computational and
memory demands, limiting efficient training strategies and on-device learning.
Although existing local learning rules achieve local temporal credit assignment
by leveraging eligibility traces, they fail to address the spatial credit
assignment without resorting to auxiliary layer-wise matrices, which increase
memory overhead and hinder scalability, especially on embedded devices. In this
work, we propose Traces Propagation (TP), a forward-only, memory-efficient,
scalable, and fully local learning rule that combines eligibility traces with a
layer-wise contrastive loss without requiring auxiliary layer-wise matrices. TP
outperforms other fully local learning rules on NMNIST and SHD datasets. On
more complex datasets such as DVS-GESTURE and DVS-CIFAR10, TP showcases
competitive performance and scales effectively to deeper SNN architectures such
as VGG-9, while providing favorable memory scaling compared to prior fully
local scalable rules, for datasets with a significant number of classes.
Finally, we show that TP is well suited for practical fine-tuning tasks, such
as keyword spotting on the Google Speech Commands dataset, thus paving the way
for efficient learning at the edge.

TL;DR: 通过反转推理数据构建逆向推理数据集r1k，研究双向推理目标下SFT和DPO对模型对齐的影响，发现混合推理数据会产生冲突监督信号


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要关注单向监督微调，忽略了不同推理模式之间的复杂相互作用，需要研究双向推理目标下的对齐策略

Method: 从s1k数据集中反转1000个正向示例构建高质量逆向推理数据集r1k，分别进行SFT和DPO实验，评估双向推理目标下的模型表现

Result: 在r1k上进行SFT相比s1k在评估基准上获得1.6%-6.8%的准确率提升，但混合正逆向数据会削弱方向区分度，DPO只能部分恢复区分度同时抑制较少偏好的推理路径

Conclusion: 混合推理数据会引入冲突的监督信号，需要开发具有方向感知能力的鲁棒对齐策略

Abstract: Existing work has shown that o1-level performance can be achieved with
limited data distillation, but most existing methods focus on unidirectional
supervised fine-tuning (SFT), overlooking the intricate interplay between
diverse reasoning patterns. In this paper, we construct r1k, a high-quality
reverse reasoning dataset derived by inverting 1,000 forward examples from s1k,
and examine how SFT and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) affect alignment
under bidirectional reasoning objectives. SFT on r1k yields a 1.6%--6.8%
accuracy improvement over s1k across evaluated benchmarks. However, naively
mixing forward and reverse data during SFT weakens the directional distinction.
Although DPO can partially recover this distinction, it also suppresses less
preferred reasoning paths by shifting the probability mass toward irrelevant
outputs. These findings suggest that mixed reasoning data introduce conflicting
supervision signals, underscoring the need for robust and direction-aware
alignment strategies.

Abstract: Discovering valid and meaningful mathematical equations from observed data
plays a crucial role in scientific discovery. While this task, symbolic
regression, remains challenging due to the vast search space and the trade-off
between accuracy and complexity. In this paper, we introduce DiffuSR, a
pre-training framework for symbolic regression built upon a continuous-state
diffusion language model. DiffuSR employs a trainable embedding layer within
the diffusion process to map discrete mathematical symbols into a continuous
latent space, modeling equation distributions effectively. Through iterative
denoising, DiffuSR converts an initial noisy sequence into a symbolic equation,
guided by numerical data injected via a cross-attention mechanism. We also
design an effective inference strategy to enhance the accuracy of the
diffusion-based equation generator, which injects logit priors into genetic
programming. Experimental results on standard symbolic regression benchmarks
demonstrate that DiffuSR achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art
autoregressive methods and generates more interpretable and diverse

*Paul Garnier,Vincent Lannelongue,Elie Hachem*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种从粗到细的课程学习方法，通过在粗网格上先训练然后逐步引入高分辨率网格，显著加速图神经网络在计算流体动力学中的训练速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法在高分辨率非结构化网格上训练图神经网络成本过高，需要寻找更高效的训练策略来降低计算成本。

Method: 采用课程学习策略，先使用非常粗糙的网格进行训练，然后逐步引入中等和高分辨率网格数据，模型架构保持不变。

Result: 在保持可比泛化精度的同时，将总训练时间减少了高达50%，在模型容量不足的情况下也能突破训练瓶颈。

Conclusion: 从粗到细的课程学习是训练高分辨率网格上图神经网络的有效策略，能显著提高训练效率并帮助模型突破性能瓶颈。

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have emerged as powerful surrogates for
mesh-based computational fluid dynamics (CFD), but training them on
high-resolution unstructured meshes with hundreds of thousands of nodes remains
prohibitively expensive. We study a \emph{coarse-to-fine curriculum} that
accelerates convergence by first training on very coarse meshes and then
progressively introducing medium and high resolutions (up to \(3\times10^5\)
nodes). Unlike multiscale GNN architectures, the model itself is unchanged;
only the fidelity of the training data varies over time. We achieve comparable
generalization accuracy while reducing total wall-clock time by up to 50\%.
Furthermore, on datasets where our model lacks the capacity to learn the
underlying physics, using curriculum learning enables it to break through
plateaus.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文研究了图异质性对消息传递图神经网络性能的影响，通过添加自环和平行边来更新异质图，分析了图拉普拉斯特征值变化与GCN性能趋势的关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图异质性对MP-GNNs性能构成挑战，特别是低通滤波器如GCN在异质图上性能下降，需要深入分析其性能表现。

Method: 通过向异质图添加自环和平行边，观察图拉普拉斯特征值的变化，并在多个基准异质网络上测试GCN的性能趋势。

Result: 研究发现GCN在添加自环和平行边时表现出不同的性能趋势，建立了图谱与低通滤波器性能趋势之间的联系。

Conclusion: 该工作能够通过观察低通滤波器的性能趋势来无缝评估图谱和属性，避免了昂贵的特征值分解，为理解图异质性对GNN性能的影响提供了新视角。

Abstract: Graph heterophily poses a formidable challenge to the performance of
Message-passing Graph Neural Networks (MP-GNNs). The familiar low-pass filters
like Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) face performance degradation, which
can be attributed to the blending of the messages from dissimilar neighboring
nodes. The performance of the low-pass filters on heterophilic graphs still
requires an in-depth analysis. In this context, we update the heterophilic
graphs by adding a number of self-loops and parallel edges. We observe that
eigenvalues of the graph Laplacian decrease and increase respectively by
increasing the number of self-loops and parallel edges. We conduct several
studies regarding the performance of GCN on various benchmark heterophilic
networks by adding either self-loops or parallel edges. The studies reveal that
the GCN exhibited either increasing or decreasing performance trends on adding
self-loops and parallel edges. In light of the studies, we established
connections between the graph spectra and the performance trends of the
low-pass filters on the heterophilic graphs. The graph spectra characterize the
essential intrinsic properties of the input graph like the presence of
connected components, sparsity, average degree, cluster structures, etc. Our
work is adept at seamlessly evaluating graph spectrum and properties by
observing the performance trends of the low-pass filters without pursuing the
costly eigenvalue decomposition. The theoretical foundations are also discussed
to validate the impact of adding self-loops and parallel edges on the graph
spectrum.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 金融领域需要复杂的多步骤搜索和时间敏感数据分析，是评估搜索能力和知识推理的理想场景，但现有开源数据集缺乏对端到端代理数据搜索能力的评估。

Method: 构建包含三个任务（时间敏感数据获取、简单历史查询、复杂历史调查）的基准测试，聘请70位金融专家进行标注，实施严格的多阶段质量保证流程，涵盖全球和大中华区市场。

Result: Grok 4在网络搜索版本中在全球子集上表现最佳，接近专家级准确率；DouBao在网络搜索版本中在大中华区子集领先。实验显示配备网络搜索和金融插件能显著提升性能，模型和工具的国家来源对性能有显著影响。

Conclusion: FinSearchComp通过与真实分析师任务对齐并提供端到端评估，为复杂金融搜索和推理提供了一个专业、高难度的测试平台。

Abstract: Search has emerged as core infrastructure for LLM-based agents and is widely
viewed as critical on the path toward more general intelligence. Finance is a
particularly demanding proving ground: analysts routinely conduct complex,
multi-step searches over time-sensitive, domain-specific data, making it ideal
for assessing both search proficiency and knowledge-grounded reasoning. Yet no
existing open financial datasets evaluate data searching capability of
end-to-end agents, largely because constructing realistic, complicated tasks
requires deep financial expertise and time-sensitive data is hard to evaluate.
We present FinSearchComp, the first fully open-source agent benchmark for
realistic, open-domain financial search and reasoning. FinSearchComp comprises
three tasks -- Time-Sensitive Data Fetching, Simple Historical Lookup, and
Complex Historical Investigation -- closely reproduce real-world financial
analyst workflows. To ensure difficulty and reliability, we engage 70
professional financial experts for annotation and implement a rigorous
multi-stage quality-assurance pipeline. The benchmark includes 635 questions
spanning global and Greater China markets, and we evaluate 21 models (products)
on it. Grok 4 (web) tops the global subset, approaching expert-level accuracy.
DouBao (web) leads on the Greater China subset. Experimental analyses show that
equipping agents with web search and financial plugins substantially improves
results on FinSearchComp, and the country origin of models and tools impact
performance significantly.By aligning with realistic analyst tasks and
providing end-to-end evaluation, FinSearchComp offers a professional,
high-difficulty testbed for complex financial search and reasoning.

Motivation: 研究生成概率分类器中的个体公平性问题，分析后验推断对私有特征扰动的鲁棒性，探索公平性与准确性之间的权衡关系

Method: 使用贝叶斯网络作为基础生成模型，在14个具有公平性问题的数据集上进行实验，将鲁棒性分析问题重新表述为辅助马尔可夫随机场中的最可能解释任务

Result: 实验证实了鲁棒性与预测准确性之间的相关性假设，鲁棒性更强的实例更可能被准确分类

Conclusion: 研究结果为缓解传统公平性与准确性之间的权衡提供了新的方向，通过鲁棒性分析可以同时改善公平性和准确性

Abstract: We investigate individual fairness in generative probabilistic classifiers by
analysing the robustness of posterior inferences to perturbations in private
features. Building on established results in robustness analysis, we
hypothesise a correlation between robustness and predictive accuracy,
specifically, instances exhibiting greater robustness are more likely to be
classified accurately. We empirically assess this hypothesis using a benchmark
of fourteen datasets with fairness concerns, employing Bayesian networks as the
underlying generative models. To address the computational complexity
associated with robustness analysis over multiple private features with
Bayesian networks, we reformulate the problem as a most probable explanation
task in an auxiliary Markov random field. Our experiments confirm the
hypothesis about the correlation, suggesting novel directions to mitigate the
traditional trade-off between fairness and accuracy.

Motivation: 现有的协方差神经网络主要针对有限维希尔伯特空间，对于无限维空间的研究不足，需要扩展鲁棒性和可迁移性到无限维场景。

Method: 构建希尔伯特协方差滤波器(HVFs)和网络(HVNs)，使用协方差算子进行图卷积，提出离散化方法，证明HVFs能够恢复功能主成分分析。

Abstract: CoVariance Neural Networks (VNNs) perform graph convolutions on the empirical
covariance matrix of signals defined over finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces,
motivated by robustness and transferability properties. Yet, little is known
about how these arguments extend to infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces. In
this work, we take a first step by introducing a novel convolutional learning
framework for signals defined over infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces,
centered on the (empirical) covariance operator. We constructively define
Hilbert coVariance Filters (HVFs) and design Hilbert coVariance Networks (HVNs)
as stacks of HVF filterbanks with nonlinear activations. We propose a
principled discretization procedure, and we prove that empirical HVFs can
recover the Functional PCA (FPCA) of the filtered signals. We then describe the
versatility of our framework with examples ranging from multivariate
real-valued functions to reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. Finally, we
validate HVNs on both synthetic and real-world time-series classification
tasks, showing robust performance compared to MLP and FPCA-based classifiers.

*Yunchuan Guan,Yu Liu,Ke Zhou,Zhiqi Shen,Jenq-Neng Hwang,Serge Belongie,Lei Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文通过建立熵受限监督设置进行公平比较，证明元学习相比全类训练具有更紧的泛化边界，在有限熵下更高效且对标签噪声和异构任务更鲁棒，并提出了MINO元学习框架提升无监督性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 近期研究表明全类训练策略训练的模型在少样本分类任务中可以达到与元学习相当的性能，为了证明元学习的价值，需要建立公平的比较设置。

Method: 建立熵受限监督设置进行理论分析和实验验证；提出MINO元学习框架，使用DBSCAN自适应聚类算法和动态头进行无监督任务构建，以及基于稳定性的元缩放器来对抗标签噪声。

Result: 理论分析和实验验证表明元学习具有更紧的泛化边界，在有限熵下更高效，对标签噪声和异构任务更鲁棒；MINO框架在多个无监督少样本和零样本任务中表现出色。

Conclusion: 元学习在熵受限设置下相比全类训练具有优势，特别是在无监督任务中；MINO框架有效提升了无监督性能，证明了元学习的实用价值。

Abstract: Meta-learning is a powerful paradigm for tackling few-shot tasks. However,
recent studies indicate that models trained with the whole-class training
strategy can achieve comparable performance to those trained with meta-learning
in few-shot classification tasks. To demonstrate the value of meta-learning, we
establish an entropy-limited supervised setting for fair comparisons. Through
both theoretical analysis and experimental validation, we establish that
meta-learning has a tighter generalization bound compared to whole-class
training. We unravel that meta-learning is more efficient with limited entropy
and is more robust to label noise and heterogeneous tasks, making it
well-suited for unsupervised tasks. Based on these insights, We propose MINO, a
meta-learning framework designed to enhance unsupervised performance. MINO
utilizes the adaptive clustering algorithm DBSCAN with a dynamic head for
unsupervised task construction and a stability-based meta-scaler for robustness
against label noise. Extensive experiments confirm its effectiveness in
multiple unsupervised few-shot and zero-shot tasks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TRUST-FS是一种新的多视图无监督特征选择方法，专门处理具有缺失变量的不完整多视图数据，通过张量分解框架同时进行特征选择、缺失值填补和视图权重学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法存在三个主要问题：1) 只能处理缺失视图，无法处理更一般的缺失变量场景；2) 将填补和特征选择作为独立过程处理，忽略了它们的相互作用；3) 缺失数据导致相似性图不准确，影响特征选择性能。

Method: 提出基于自适应加权CP分解的张量分解框架，利用主观逻辑获取可信的跨视图相似性信息，学习可靠的相似性图来指导特征选择和填补。

Result: 综合实验结果表明，该方法在有效性和优越性方面都优于现有最先进的方法。

Conclusion: TRUST-FS通过统一的张量分解框架成功解决了不完整多视图数据中的特征选择问题，实现了特征选择、缺失值填补和视图权重学习的协同优化。

Abstract: Multi-view unsupervised feature selection (MUFS), which selects informative
features from multi-view unlabeled data, has attracted increasing research
interest in recent years. Although great efforts have been devoted to MUFS,
several challenges remain: 1) existing methods for incomplete multi-view data
are limited to handling missing views and are unable to address the more
general scenario of missing variables, where some features have missing values
in certain views; 2) most methods address incomplete data by first imputing
missing values and then performing feature selection, treating these two
processes independently and overlooking their interactions; 3) missing data can
result in an inaccurate similarity graph, which reduces the performance of
feature selection. To solve this dilemma, we propose a novel MUFS method for
incomplete multi-view data with missing variables, termed Tensorized Reliable
UnSupervised mulTi-view Feature Selection (TRUST-FS). TRUST-FS introduces a new
adaptive-weighted CP decomposition that simultaneously performs feature
selection, missing-variable imputation, and view weight learning within a
unified tensor factorization framework. By utilizing Subjective Logic to
acquire trustworthy cross-view similarity information, TRUST-FS facilitates
learning a reliable similarity graph, which subsequently guides feature
selection and imputation. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate the
effectiveness and superiority of our method over state-of-the-art methods.

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合双向时序图注意力变换器(B-TGAT)的时间分布混合U-Net自编码器，用于高维多变量时空气候数据的高效时序聚类，在三个数据集上表现出优异的聚类分离性和时序稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高维多变量时空气候数据的聚类具有挑战性，传统方法难以同时捕捉局部和全局时序关系并保持空间上下文。需要新的方法来处理复杂的时间依赖性、演化的空间交互和非平稳动态。

Method: 使用时间分布混合U-Net自编码器，编码器和解码器配备ConvLSTM2D模块提取联合时空特征，通过跳跃连接保持多尺度空间细节。在瓶颈处集成B-TGAT，结合基于图的空间建模和注意力驱动的时序编码。

Result: 在三个不同的时空气候数据集上实验表明，相比最先进的基线方法，该方法具有更优的聚类分离性、时序稳定性，并且与已知的气候转变对齐。

Conclusion: ConvLSTM2D、U-Net跳跃连接和B-TGAT的集成提升了时序聚类性能，同时为复杂的时空变异性提供了可解释的见解，推动了方法学发展和气候科学应用。

Abstract: Clustering high-dimensional multivariate spatiotemporal climate data is
challenging due to complex temporal dependencies, evolving spatial
interactions, and non-stationary dynamics. Conventional clustering methods,
including recurrent and convolutional models, often struggle to capture both
local and global temporal relationships while preserving spatial context. We
present a time-distributed hybrid U-Net autoencoder that integrates a
Bi-directional Temporal Graph Attention Transformer (B-TGAT) to guide efficient
temporal clustering of multidimensional spatiotemporal climate datasets. The
encoder and decoder are equipped with ConvLSTM2D modules that extract joint
spatial--temporal features by modeling localized dynamics and spatial
correlations over time, and skip connections that preserve multiscale spatial
details during feature compression and reconstruction. At the bottleneck,
B-TGAT integrates graph-based spatial modeling with attention-driven temporal
encoding, enabling adaptive weighting of temporal neighbors and capturing both
short and long-range dependencies across regions. This architecture produces
discriminative latent embeddings optimized for clustering. Experiments on three
distinct spatiotemporal climate datasets demonstrate superior cluster
separability, temporal stability, and alignment with known climate transitions
compared to state-of-the-art baselines. The integration of ConvLSTM2D, U-Net
skip connections, and B-TGAT enhances temporal clustering performance while
providing interpretable insights into complex spatiotemporal variability,
advancing both methodological development and climate science applications.

Conclusion: HAM框架通过动态合并适配器的分层方法，有效解决了持续学习中的扩展性和灾难性遗忘问题，为管理大量任务提供了高效的解决方案

Abstract: Continual learning is an essential capability of human cognition, yet it
poses significant challenges for current deep learning models. The primary
issue is that new knowledge can interfere with previously learned information,
causing the model to forget earlier knowledge in favor of the new, a phenomenon
known as catastrophic forgetting. Although large pre-trained models can
partially mitigate forgetting by leveraging their existing knowledge and
over-parameterization, they often struggle when confronted with novel data
distributions. Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods, such as LoRA,
enable efficient adaptation to new knowledge. However, they still face
challenges in scaling to dynamic learning scenarios and long sequences of
tasks, as maintaining one adapter per task introduces complexity and increases
the potential for interference. In this paper, we introduce Hierarchical
Adapters Merging (HAM), a novel framework that dynamically combines adapters
from different tasks during training. This approach enables HAM to scale
effectively, allowing it to manage more tasks than competing baselines with
improved efficiency. To achieve this, HAM maintains a fixed set of groups that
hierarchically consolidate new adapters. For each task, HAM trains a low-rank
adapter along with an importance scalar, then dynamically groups tasks based on
adapter similarity. Within each group, adapters are pruned, scaled and merge,
facilitating transfer learning between related tasks. Extensive experiments on
three vision benchmarks show that HAM significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art methods, particularly as the number of tasks increases.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在机器学习回归任务中，由于计算资源限制或标注成本高昂，标注训练数据往往有限。因此需要从无标注数据中选择合适的训练集来平衡性能与效率

Method: 推导了Lipschitz连续回归模型预测误差的上界，该上界与训练集的加权填充距离线性相关。提出了密度感知最远点采样(DA-FPS)方法，通过近似最小化数据驱动的加权填充距离估计来优化该上界

Result: 在三个数据集上使用两种回归模型进行实验，结果显示DA-FPS相比其他采样策略显著降低了平均绝对预测误差

Conclusion: DA-FPS是一种有效的被动且模型无关的采样方法，仅基于数据特征表示就能选择出高质量的训练样本，在有限标注数据场景下具有重要应用价值

Abstract: We focus on training machine learning regression models in scenarios where
the availability of labeled training data is limited due to computational
constraints or high labeling costs. Thus, selecting suitable training sets from
unlabeled data is essential for balancing performance and efficiency. For the
selection of the training data, we focus on passive and model-agnostic sampling
methods that only consider the data feature representations. We derive an upper
bound for the expected prediction error of Lipschitz continuous regression
models that linearly depends on the weighted fill distance of the training set,
a quantity we can estimate simply by considering the data features. We
introduce "Density-Aware Farthest Point Sampling" (DA-FPS), a novel sampling
method. We prove that DA-FPS provides approximate minimizers for a data-driven
estimation of the weighted fill distance, thereby aiming at minimizing our
derived bound. We conduct experiments using two regression models across three
datasets. The results demonstrate that DA-FPS significantly reduces the mean
absolute prediction error compared to other sampling strategies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决罕见疾病成像、基因组学和灾害响应等领域中数据不平衡和小样本的问题，现有方法如过采样、焦点损失或元加权等方法存在脆弱性或复杂性，需要更统一的解决方案。

Method: 提出FOSSIL框架，通过样本敏感重要性学习，将类别不平衡校正、难度感知课程学习、数据增强惩罚和预热机制统一到一个可解释的公式中，无需改变模型架构。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上，FOSSIL在经验上一致优于ERM、课程学习和元加权基线方法，并提供基于遗憾的理论保证。

Conclusion: FOSSIL提供了一个理论上有保证、实践中有效的统一框架，能够灵活处理数据不平衡和小样本学习中的多个挑战，具有很好的泛化性和实用性。

Abstract: Imbalanced and small data regimes are pervasive in domains such as rare
disease imaging, genomics, and disaster response, where labeled samples are
scarce and naive augmentation often introduces artifacts. Existing solutions
such as oversampling, focal loss, or meta-weighting address isolated aspects of
this challenge but remain fragile or complex. We introduce FOSSIL (Flexible
Optimization via Sample Sensitive Importance Learning), a unified weighting
framework that seamlessly integrates class imbalance correction,
difficulty-aware curricula, augmentation penalties, and warmup dynamics into a
single interpretable formula. Unlike prior heuristics, the proposed framework
provides regret-based theoretical guarantees and achieves consistent empirical
gains over ERM, curriculum, and meta-weighting baselines on synthetic and
real-world datasets, while requiring no architectural changes.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的联邦学习后门攻击方法OBA，使用分布外数据作为毒化样本和触发器，并设计了SoDa技术增强隐蔽性。同时提出了BNGuard防御方法，利用批归一化层统计偏差检测恶意模型更新。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统后门攻击需要可见触发器和物理修改目标对象，应用场景受限。为了解决这一局限性，需要开发更隐蔽、更实用的联邦学习后门攻击方法。

Method: OBA使用分布外(OOD)数据同时作为毒化样本和触发器；SoDa通过正则化恶意本地模型的幅度和方向，使其与良性版本对齐以逃避检测；BNGuard利用OOD数据导致批归一化层运行统计显著偏差的特性来识别恶意更新。

Result: 实验表明OBA能有效绕过最先进的防御方法，同时保持主任务的高准确率；BNGuard在各种设置下都能有效防御SoDa攻击。

Conclusion: 该工作扩展了联邦学习后门攻击的场景范围，提出了新的攻击和防御方法，为联邦学习系统的安全性提供了重要见解和解决方案。

Abstract: Traditional backdoor attacks in federated learning (FL) operate within
constrained attack scenarios, as they depend on visible triggers and require
physical modifications to the target object, which limits their practicality.
To address this limitation, we introduce a novel backdoor attack prototype for
FL called the out-of-distribution (OOD) backdoor attack ($\mathtt{OBA}$), which
uses OOD data as both poisoned samples and triggers simultaneously. Our
approach significantly broadens the scope of backdoor attack scenarios in FL.
To improve the stealthiness of $\mathtt{OBA}$, we propose $\mathtt{SoDa}$,
which regularizes both the magnitude and direction of malicious local models
during local training, aligning them closely with their benign versions to
evade detection. Empirical results demonstrate that $\mathtt{OBA}$ effectively
circumvents state-of-the-art defenses while maintaining high accuracy on the
main task.
  To address this security vulnerability in the FL system, we introduce
$\mathtt{BNGuard}$, a new server-side defense method tailored against
$\mathtt{SoDa}$. $\mathtt{BNGuard}$ leverages the observation that OOD data
causes significant deviations in the running statistics of batch normalization
layers. This allows $\mathtt{BNGuard}$ to identify malicious model updates and
exclude them from aggregation, thereby enhancing the backdoor robustness of FL.
Extensive experiments across various settings show the effectiveness of
$\mathtt{BNGuard}$ on defending against $\mathtt{SoDa}$. The code is available
at https://github.com/JiiahaoXU/SoDa-BNGuard.

### [210] [Single-stream Policy Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13232)
*Zhongwen Xu,Zihan Ding*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SPO提出单流策略优化方法，通过持久化KL自适应值跟踪器和全局优势归一化，解决了GRPO等分组方法的退化组问题和可扩展性限制，在数学推理任务上显著提升性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于分组的策略梯度方法（如GRPO）存在退化组消除学习信号和同步障碍限制可扩展性的问题，需要更稳定高效的单样本优化方法

Method: SPO使用持久化KL自适应值跟踪器替代每组基线，在批次内全局归一化优势，提供稳定的低方差学习信号，无需分组从而实现更高吞吐量

Result: 在Qwen3-8B模型上，SPO比GRPO收敛更平滑准确率更高，在五个数学基准测试中平均maj@32提升3.4个百分点，在BRUMO 25上提升7.3pp，AIME 25上提升4.4pp

Conclusion: SPO的成功表明通过基本原理而非架构变通来驱动LLM推理进步的有效路径，挑战了RL算法增加附带复杂度的主流趋势

Abstract: We revisit policy-gradient optimization for Large Language Models (LLMs) from
a single-stream perspective. Prevailing group-based methods like GRPO reduce
variance with on-the-fly baselines but suffer from critical flaws: frequent
degenerate groups erase learning signals, and synchronization barriers hinder
scalability. We introduce Single-stream Policy Optimization (SPO), which
eliminates these issues by design. SPO replaces per-group baselines with a
persistent, KL-adaptive value tracker and normalizes advantages globally across
the batch, providing a stable, low-variance learning signal for every sample.
Being group-free, SPO enables higher throughput and scales effectively in
long-horizon or tool-integrated settings where generation times vary.
Furthermore, the persistent value tracker naturally enables an adaptive
curriculum via prioritized sampling. Experiments using Qwen3-8B show that SPO
converges more smoothly and attains higher accuracy than GRPO, while
eliminating computation wasted on degenerate groups. Ablation studies confirm
that SPO's gains stem from its principled approach to baseline estimation and
advantage normalization, offering a more robust and efficient path for LLM
reasoning. Across five hard math benchmarks with Qwen3 8B, SPO improves the
average maj@32 by +3.4 percentage points (pp) over GRPO, driven by substantial
absolute point gains on challenging datasets, including +7.3 pp on BRUMO 25,
+4.4 pp on AIME 25, +3.3 pp on HMMT 25, and achieves consistent relative gain
in pass@$k$ across the evaluated $k$ values. SPO's success challenges the
prevailing trend of adding incidental complexity to RL algorithms, highlighting
a path where fundamental principles, not architectural workarounds, drive the
next wave of progress in LLM reasoning.

Method: 通过模型的元认知分析将重复推理片段转化为简洁可重用的"行为"（名称+指令），存储在行为手册中，在推理时提供上下文提示或通过监督微调蒸馏到参数中。

Result: 在三种设置下均取得改进：1）行为条件推理减少46%推理token同时保持或提高准确性；2）行为引导自改进使准确率提高10%；3）行为条件SFT更有效将非推理模型转化为推理模型。

Conclusion: 将缓慢推导转化为快速程序提示使LLM能够记住如何推理，而不仅仅是记住结论，提高了推理效率和效果。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) now solve multi-step problems by emitting
extended chains of thought. During the process, they often re-derive the same
intermediate steps across problems, inflating token usage and latency. This
saturation of the context window leaves less capacity for exploration. We study
a simple mechanism that converts recurring reasoning fragments into concise,
reusable "behaviors" (name + instruction) via the model's own metacognitive
analysis of prior traces. These behaviors are stored in a "behavior handbook"
which supplies them to the model in-context at inference or distills them into
parameters via supervised fine-tuning. This approach achieves improved
test-time reasoning across three different settings - 1) Behavior-conditioned
inference: Providing the LLM relevant behaviors in-context during reasoning
reduces number of reasoning tokens by up to 46% while matching or improving
baseline accuracy; 2) Behavior-guided self-improvement: Without any parameter
updates, the model improves its own future reasoning by leveraging behaviors
from its own past problem solving attempts. This yields up to 10% higher
accuracy than a naive critique-and-revise baseline; and 3) Behavior-conditioned
SFT: SFT on behavior-conditioned reasoning traces is more effective at
converting non-reasoning models into reasoning models as compared to vanilla
SFT. Together, these results indicate that turning slow derivations into fast
procedural hints enables LLMs to remember how to reason, not just what to
conclude.

*Bo Yin,Xingyi Yang,Xinchao Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: NoRA是首个直接适配非线性激活函数的参数高效微调框架，通过可学习的有理函数替换固定激活函数，在仅更新0.4%参数的情况下达到或超过全量微调性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的参数高效微调方法主要调整权重矩阵而保持激活函数固定，限制了模型适应能力。作者希望探索激活函数空间的调优作为权重调优的补充方案。

Method: 使用可学习有理函数替换固定激活函数，对分子和分母系数应用结构化低秩更新，采用分组设计实现局部适配并提高稳定性。

Result: 在CIFAR数据集上达到或超过全量微调性能，仅更新0.02M参数；与LoRA结合(NoRA++)在相同训练预算下表现更优；在LLaMA3-8B指令调优中持续提升生成质量，MMLU平均提升0.3%-0.8%。

Conclusion: 激活空间调优是权重调优的补充性高效替代方案，应将激活函数作为模型适配的一等公民。

Abstract: Existing parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods primarily adapt
weight matrices while keeping activation functions fixed. We introduce
\textbf{NoRA}, the first PEFT framework that directly adapts nonlinear
activation functions in pretrained transformer-based models. NoRA replaces
fixed activations with learnable rational functions and applies structured
low-rank updates to numerator and denominator coefficients, with a group-wise
design that localizes adaptation and improves stability at minimal cost. On
vision transformers trained on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100, NoRA matches or exceeds
full fine-tuning while updating only 0.4\% of parameters (0.02M), achieving
accuracy gains of +0.17\% and +0.27\%. When combined with LoRA
(\textbf{NoRA++}), it outperforms LoRA and DoRA under matched training budgets
by adding fewer trainable parameters. On LLaMA3-8B instruction tuning, NoRA++
consistently improves generation quality, yielding average MMLU gains of
+0.3\%--0.8\%, including +1.6\% on STEM (Alpaca) and +1.3\% on OpenOrca. We
further show that NoRA constrains adaptation to a low-dimensional functional
subspace, implicitly regularizing update magnitude and direction. These results
establish activation-space tuning as a complementary and highly
parameter-efficient alternative to weight-based PEFT, positioning activation
functions as first-class objects for model adaptation.

*Zhizhong Zhao,Ke Chen*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种后处理单前向传播框架SPC-UQ，通过分割点分析(SPA)联合捕捉任意性和认知不确定性，无需修改或重新训练预训练模型，在回归和分类任务中实现高效的不确定性量化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有不确定性量化方法要么计算成本高（如贝叶斯或集成方法），要么只能提供部分、任务特定的估计（如单前向传播技术），需要一种既能高效计算又能全面捕捉不确定性的方法。

Method: 使用分割点分析(SPA)将预测残差分解为上下子集，计算每侧的平均绝对残差(MARs)。通过自一致性差异分数(SDS)进行细粒度认知估计。回归任务中使用分位数回归获得预测区间，分类任务中基于SPA校准softmax输出。

Result: 在多种回归和分类基准测试中，该方法匹配或超越了多个最先进的不确定性量化方法，同时计算开销极小。

Conclusion: SPC-UQ框架提供了一种高效、全面的不确定性量化解决方案，能够在保持低计算成本的同时，有效捕捉任意性和认知不确定性，适用于实际部署场景。

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification (UQ) is vital for trustworthy deep learning, yet
existing methods are either computationally intensive, such as Bayesian or
ensemble methods, or provide only partial, task-specific estimates, such as
single-forward-pass techniques. In this paper, we propose a post-hoc
single-forward-pass framework that jointly captures aleatoric and epistemic
uncertainty without modifying or retraining pretrained models. Our method
applies \emph{Split-Point Analysis} (SPA) to decompose predictive residuals
into upper and lower subsets, computing \emph{Mean Absolute Residuals} (MARs)
on each side. We prove that, under ideal conditions, the total MAR equals the
harmonic mean of subset MARs; deviations define a novel \emph{Self-consistency
Discrepancy Score} (SDS) for fine-grained epistemic estimation across
regression and classification. For regression, side-specific quantile
regression yields prediction intervals with improved empirical coverage, which
are further calibrated via SDS. For classification, when calibration data are
available, we apply SPA-based calibration identities to adjust the softmax
outputs and then compute predictive entropy on these calibrated probabilities.
Extensive experiments on diverse regression and classification benchmarks
demonstrate that our framework matches or exceeds several state-of-the-art UQ
methods while incurring minimal overhead.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出JANUS框架，通过局部特征流形对齐和全局结构语义一致性，解决图神经网络节点注入攻击的隐蔽性问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有节点注入攻击方法依赖间接代理指标，缺乏对注入内容本质特征的考虑，或仅关注局部结构模仿，存在局部短视问题

Method: 双约束隐蔽节点注入框架：局部层面使用特征流形对齐实现几何一致性；全局层面引入结构化潜变量并最大化互信息；将注入攻击建模为强化学习序列决策过程

Result: 在多个标准数据集上实验表明，JANUS框架在攻击效果和隐蔽性方面显著优于现有方法

Conclusion: JANUS框架通过局部和全局双重约束，有效提升了节点注入攻击的隐蔽性和攻击效果，解决了现有方法的局限性

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have demonstrated remarkable performance across
various applications, yet they are vulnerable to sophisticated adversarial
attacks, particularly node injection attacks. The success of such attacks
heavily relies on their stealthiness, the ability to blend in with the original
graph and evade detection. However, existing methods often achieve stealthiness
by relying on indirect proxy metrics, lacking consideration for the fundamental
characteristics of the injected content, or focusing only on imitating local
structures, which leads to the problem of local myopia. To overcome these
limitations, we propose a dual-constraint stealthy node injection framework,
called Joint Alignment of Nodal and Universal Structures (JANUS). At the local
level, we introduce a local feature manifold alignment strategy to achieve
geometric consistency in the feature space. At the global level, we incorporate
structured latent variables and maximize the mutual information with the
generated structures, ensuring the injected structures are consistent with the
semantic patterns of the original graph. We model the injection attack as a
sequential decision process, which is optimized by a reinforcement learning
agent. Experiments on multiple standard datasets demonstrate that the JANUS
framework significantly outperforms existing methods in terms of both attack
effectiveness and stealthiness.

*Rodrigo M Carrillo-Larco*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本研究探讨了大型语言模型仅基于文本描述准确预测食物营养含量的能力，发现经过参数高效微调后，开源LLM能够从24小时饮食回顾中准确预测能量和宏量营养素。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大多数人工智能营养估算工具依赖图像输入，但基于纯文本描述的食物营养值预测能力尚不清楚。如果有效，这种方法可以实现无需照片的简化饮食监测。

Method: 使用NHANES青少年24小时饮食回顾数据，采用10-shot思维链提示的开源量化LLM，基于纯文本食物描述估算能量和五种宏量营养素，并应用参数高效微调(PEFT)评估准确性提升。

Result: 在11,281名青少年数据中，原始LLM预测效果差（能量MAE为652.08，Lin's CCC <0.46），但经过微调的模型表现显著改善（能量MAE降至171.34-190.90，Lin's CCC >0.89）。

Conclusion: 通过思维链提示和PEFT微调，开源LLM仅基于文本输入就能准确预测24小时饮食回顾中的能量和宏量营养素值，为低负担的文本基饮食监测工具提供了前景。

Abstract: BACKGROUND: Most artificial intelligence tools used to estimate nutritional
content rely on image input. However, whether large language models (LLMs) can
accurately predict nutritional values based solely on text descriptions of
foods consumed remains unknown. If effective, this approach could enable
simpler dietary monitoring without the need for photographs. METHODS: We used
24-hour dietary recalls from adolescents aged 12-19 years in the National
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). An open-source quantized LLM
was prompted using a 10-shot, chain-of-thought approach to estimate energy and
five macronutrients based solely on text strings listing foods and their
quantities. We then applied parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) to evaluate
whether predictive accuracy improved. NHANES-calculated values served as the
ground truth for energy, proteins, carbohydrates, total sugar, dietary fiber
and total fat. RESULTS: In a pooled dataset of 11,281 adolescents (49.9% male,
mean age 15.4 years), the vanilla LLM yielded poor predictions. The mean
absolute error (MAE) was 652.08 for energy and the Lin's CCC <0.46 across
endpoints. In contrast, the fine-tuned model performed substantially better,
with energy MAEs ranging from 171.34 to 190.90 across subsets, and Lin's CCC
exceeding 0.89 for all outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: When prompted using a
chain-of-thought approach and fine-tuned with PEFT, open-source LLMs exposed
solely to text input can accurately predict energy and macronutrient values
from 24-hour dietary recalls. This approach holds promise for low-burden,
text-based dietary monitoring tools.

TL;DR: WebSailor是一种后训练方法，通过生成高不确定性任务、RFT冷启动和DUPO算法，使开源LLM在复杂信息搜索任务中达到与专有代理相当的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 超越人类认知限制是LLM训练的关键前沿。专有代理系统在复杂信息搜索基准上表现出超人类能力，而开源模型缺乏系统化处理极端不确定性的推理模式。

Method: 通过结构化采样和信息模糊化生成新颖的高不确定性任务，采用RFT冷启动，并使用高效的代理强化学习训练算法DUPO（重复采样策略优化）。

Result: WebSailor在复杂信息搜索任务中显著优于所有开源代理，匹配专有代理的性能，缩小了能力差距。

Conclusion: 该方法成功地将系统化处理不确定性的关键能力注入开源模型，实现了与专有代理相当的性能表现。

Abstract: Transcending human cognitive limitations represents a critical frontier in
LLM training. Proprietary agentic systems like DeepResearch have demonstrated
superhuman capabilities on extremely complex information-seeking benchmarks
such as BrowseComp, a feat previously unattainable. We posit that their success
hinges on a sophisticated reasoning pattern absent in open-source models: the
ability to systematically reduce extreme uncertainty when navigating vast
information landscapes. Based on this insight, we introduce WebSailor, a
complete post-training methodology designed to instill this crucial capability.
Our approach involves generating novel, high-uncertainty tasks through
structured sampling and information obfuscation, RFT cold start, and an
efficient agentic RL training algorithm, Duplicating Sampling Policy
Optimization (DUPO). With this integrated pipeline, WebSailor significantly
outperforms all open-source agents in complex information-seeking tasks,
matching proprietary agents' performance and closing the capability gap.

three specialized AI agents: a specification-matrix-conditioned question
generator, a solver/explainer for detailed step-by-step reasoning, and a

Motivation: 铁路优化决策系统能显著减少延误，但现有研究通常与特定工业用例紧密绑定，缺乏公开代码和数据，导致难以复现和比较算法性能。

Method: 引入统一的DISPLIB问题定义和文件格式，收集多个真实工业用例的问题实例并公开，提供参考求解器实现。

Conclusion: DISPLIB为火车重路由和重调度研究提供了标准化框架，促进了该领域的开放研究和算法性能比较，所有材料已在线公开。

Abstract: Optimization-based decision support systems have a significant potential to
reduce delays, and thus improve efficiency on the railways, by automatically
re-routing and re-scheduling trains after delays have occurred. The operations
research community has dedicated a lot of effort to developing optimization
algorithms for this problem, but each study is typically tightly connected with
a specific industrial use case. Code and data are seldom shared publicly. This
fact hinders reproducibility, and has led to a proliferation of papers
describing algorithms for more or less compatible problem definitions, without
any real opportunity for readers to assess their relative performance. Inspired
by the successful communities around MILP, SAT, TSP, VRP, etc., we introduce a
common problem definition and file format, DISPLIB, which captures all the main
features of train re-routing and re-scheduling. We have gathered problem
instances from multiple real-world use cases and made them openly available. In
this paper, we describe the problem definition, the industrial instances, and a
reference solver implementation. This allows any researcher or developer to
work on the train dispatching problem without an industrial connection, and
enables the research community to perform empirical comparisons between
solvers. All materials are available online at https://displib.github.io.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了InPhyRe基准测试，用于评估大型多模态模型在违反物理规律的场景中的归纳物理推理能力，发现现有模型在此方面存在显著不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型多模态模型仅编码训练时观察到的物理规律作为参数知识，无法处理违反这些规律的推理场景。人类具有从少量视觉示例中适应新物理环境的归纳推理能力，这对安全关键应用至关重要，但现有基准测试无法评估这种能力。

Method: 提出InPhyRe视觉问答基准，通过算法生成的合成碰撞视频来评估模型在违反物理规律的碰撞事件中的推理能力，测试了13个大型多模态模型。

Result: 研究发现：(1)模型难以将有限的参数知识应用于推理；(2)当演示样本违反物理规律时，归纳物理推理能力很弱；(3)模型存在语言偏见，很大程度上忽略了视觉输入。

Conclusion: 大型多模态模型在归纳物理推理方面存在严重缺陷，对视觉输入的信任度值得质疑，这限制了它们在安全关键应用中的可靠性。

Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) encode universal physical laws observed during
training, such as momentum conservation, as parametric knowledge. It allows
LMMs to answer physical reasoning queries, such as the outcome of a potential
collision event from visual input. However, since parametric knowledge includes
only the physical laws seen during training, it is insufficient for reasoning
when the inference scenario violates these physical laws. In contrast, humans
possess the skill to adapt their physical reasoning to unseen physical
environments from a few visual examples. This ability, which we refer to as
inductive physical reasoning, is indispensable for LMMs if they are to replace
human agents in safety-critical applications. Despite its importance, existing
visual benchmarks evaluate only the parametric knowledge in LMMs, and not
inductive physical reasoning. To this end, we propose InPhyRe, the first visual
question answering benchmark to measure inductive physical reasoning in LMMs.
InPhyRe evaluates LMMs on their ability to predict the outcome of collision
events in algorithmically generated synthetic collision videos. By inspecting
13 LMMs, InPhyRe informs us that (1) LMMs struggle to apply their limited
parametric knowledge about universal physical laws to reasoning, (2) inductive
physical reasoning in LMMs is weak when demonstration samples violate universal
physical laws, and (3) inductive physical reasoning in LMMs suffers from
language bias and largely ignores the visual inputs, questioning the
trustworthiness of LMMs regarding visual inputs.

Motivation: 现有LLM路线规划方法存在两大问题：直接使用LLM处理大规模地图数据困难，图搜索方法理解自然语言偏好能力有限，且用户时空分布高度异构不可预测

Method: 使用LLM-as-Parser理解自然语言、识别任务、提取用户偏好和任务依赖关系，结合多步图构建与迭代搜索算法(MSGS)进行最优路线查找，采用多目标优化自适应调整权重

Result: 在14个国家27个城市的1000个路由提示上进行实验，结果显示该方法在多重约束下实现了优越性能

Conclusion: LLMAP系统通过结合LLM的自然语言理解能力和图搜索算法的优化能力，有效解决了多约束路线规划问题，具有实际应用价值

Abstract: The rise of large language models (LLMs) has made natural language-driven
route planning an emerging research area that encompasses rich user objectives.
Current research exhibits two distinct approaches: direct route planning using
LLM-as-Agent and graph-based searching strategies. However, LLMs in the former
approach struggle to handle extensive map data, while the latter shows limited
capability in understanding natural language preferences. Additionally, a more
critical challenge arises from the highly heterogeneous and unpredictable
spatio-temporal distribution of users across the globe. In this paper, we
introduce a novel LLM-Assisted route Planning (LLMAP) system that employs an
LLM-as-Parser to comprehend natural language, identify tasks, and extract user
preferences and recognize task dependencies, coupled with a Multi-Step Graph
construction with iterative Search (MSGS) algorithm as the underlying solver
for optimal route finding. Our multi-objective optimization approach adaptively
tunes objective weights to maximize points of interest (POI) quality and task
completion rate while minimizing route distance, subject to three key
constraints: user time limits, POI opening hours, and task dependencies. We
conduct extensive experiments using 1,000 routing prompts sampled with varying
complexity across 14 countries and 27 cities worldwide. The results demonstrate
that our approach achieves superior performance with guarantees across multiple
constraints.

Abstract: Controlling environmental conditions and monitoring plant status in
greenhouses is critical to promptly making appropriate management decisions
aimed at promoting crop production. The primary objective of this research
study was to develop and test a smart aeroponic greenhouse on an experimental
scale where the status of Geranium plant and environmental conditions are
continuously monitored through the integration of the internet of things (IoT)
and artificial intelligence (AI). An IoT-based platform was developed to
control the environmental conditions of plants more efficiently and provide
insights to users to make informed management decisions. In addition, we
developed an AI-based disease detection framework using VGG-19,
InceptionResNetV2, and InceptionV3 algorithms to analyze the images captured
periodically after an intentional inoculation. The performance of the AI
framework was compared with an expert's evaluation of disease status.
Preliminary results showed that the IoT system implemented in the greenhouse
environment is able to publish data such as temperature, humidity, water flow,
and volume of charge tanks online continuously to users and adjust the
controlled parameters to provide an optimal growth environment for the plants.
Furthermore, the results of the AI framework demonstrate that the VGG-19
algorithm was able to identify drought stress and rust leaves from healthy
leaves with the highest accuracy, 92% among the other algorithms.

Abstract: Advances in AI-assisted research have introduced powerful tools for
literature retrieval, hypothesis generation, experimentation, and manuscript
preparation. However, systems remain fragmented and lack human-centred
workflows. To address these gaps, we introduce AIssistant, an agentic,
open-source Human-AI collaborative framework designed to simplify the
end-to-end creation of scientific workflows. Since our development is still in
an early stage, we present here the first experiments with AIssistant for
perspective and review research papers in machine learning. Our system
integrates modular tools and agents for literature synthesis, section-wise
experimentation, citation management, and automatic LaTeX paper text
generation, while maintaining human oversight at every stage to ensure
accuracy, coherence, and scholarly rigour. We conducted a comprehensive
evaluation across three layers: (1) Independent Human Review, following NeurIPS
double-blind standards; (2) Automated LLM Review, using GPT-5 as a scalable
human review proxy; and (3) Program Chair Oversight, where the chair monitors
the entire review process and makes final validation and acceptance decisions.
The results demonstrate that AIssistant improves drafting efficiency and
thematic consistency. Nonetheless, Human-AI collaboration remains essential for
maintaining factual correctness, methodological soundness, and ethical
compliance. Despite its effectiveness, we identify key limitations, including
hallucinated citations, difficulty adapting to dynamic paper structures, and
incomplete integration of multimodal content.

Conclusion: 分解方法能有效提升小型模型在UI交互意图理解任务上的能力，为设备端智能代理发展提供可行方案

Abstract: Understanding user intents from UI interaction trajectories remains a
challenging, yet crucial, frontier in intelligent agent development. While
massive, datacenter-based, multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) possess
greater capacity to handle the complexities of such sequences, smaller models
which can run on-device to provide a privacy-preserving, low-cost, and
low-latency user experience, struggle with accurate intent inference. We
address these limitations by introducing a novel decomposed approach: first, we
perform structured interaction summarization, capturing key information from
each user action. Second, we perform intent extraction using a fine-tuned model
operating on the aggregated summaries. This method improves intent
understanding in resource-constrained models, even surpassing the base
performance of large MLLMs.

Result: 在SWE-bench排行榜上，使用\sys训练的30B参数模型在开放权重模型中排名第一（Lite）和第四（Verified），性能超过参数量10倍以上的模型。

Conclusion: \sys框架有效解决了多轮工具辅助设置下的偏好优化问题，通过保持输出多样性显著提升了测试时扩展效果，在软件工程任务中实现了新的最先进性能。

Abstract: Software engineering presents complex, multi-step challenges for Large
Language Models (LLMs), requiring reasoning over large codebases and
coordinated tool use. The difficulty of these tasks is exemplified by
benchmarks like SWE-bench, where current LLMs still struggle to resolve
real-world issues.
  A promising approach to enhance performance is test-time scaling (TTS), but
its gains are heavily dependent on the diversity of model outputs.
  While standard alignment methods such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)
and Kahneman-Tversky Optimization (KTO) are effective at aligning model outputs
with human preferences, this process can come at the cost of reduced diversity,
limiting the effectiveness of TTS.
  Additionally, existing preference optimization algorithms are typically
designed for single-turn tasks and do not fully address the complexities of
multi-turn reasoning and tool integration required for interactive coding
agents.
  To bridge this gap, we introduce \sys, an entropy-enhanced framework that
adapts existing preference optimization algorithms to the multi-turn,
tool-assisted setting.
  \sys augments the preference objective to explicitly preserve policy entropy
and generalizes learning to optimize over multi-turn interactions rather than
single-turn responses.
  We validate \sys by fine-tuning a diverse suite of models from different
families and sizes (up to 106B parameters).
  To maximize performance gains from TTS, we further propose a hybrid
best-trajectory selection scheme combining a learned verifier model with model
free approaches.
  On the \swebench leaderboard, our approach establishes new state-of-the-art
results among open-weight models. A 30B parameter model trained with \sys ranks
1st on \lite and 4th on \verified on the open-weight leaderboard, surpassed
only by models with over 10x more parameters(\eg$>$350B).

TL;DR: PIWM是一个紧凑的鸟瞰图世界模型，通过Soft Mask训练和Warm Start推理技术，在保持小参数量的同时显著提升物理交互建模和预测性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决世界模型部署中大小与性能的权衡问题 - 大模型计算资源需求高不适用于边缘设备，小模型物理建模能力不足导致预测效果差

Method: 提出Physics-Informed BEV World Model (PIWM)，使用Soft Mask训练改进动态物体建模和未来预测，引入Warm Start推理技术提升零样本模型的预测质量

Result: 在相同参数量(400M)下，PIWM比基线模型加权总分提升60.6%；最小PIWM(130M Soft Mask)相比最大基线模型(400M)获得7.4%更高的加权总分和28%更快的推理速度

Conclusion: PIWM成功实现了紧凑世界模型的高性能部署，在保持小参数量的同时显著超越大模型的性能表现，为边缘设备部署提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: A major challenge in deploying world models is the trade-off between size and
performance. Large world models can capture rich physical dynamics but require
massive computing resources, making them impractical for edge devices. Small
world models are easier to deploy but often struggle to learn accurate physics,
leading to poor predictions. We propose the Physics-Informed BEV World Model
(PIWM), a compact model designed to efficiently capture physical interactions
in bird's-eye-view (BEV) representations. PIWM uses Soft Mask during training
to improve dynamic object modeling and future prediction. We also introduce a
simple yet effective technique, Warm Start, for inference to enhance prediction
quality with a zero-shot model. Experiments show that at the same parameter
scale (400M), PIWM surpasses the baseline by 60.6% in weighted overall score.
Moreover, even when compared with the largest baseline model (400M), the
smallest PIWM (130M Soft Mask) achieves a 7.4% higher weighted overall score
with a 28% faster inference speed.

*Ryan Lucas,Kayhan Behdin,Zhipeng Wang,Qingquan Song,Shao Tang,Rahul Mazumder*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出Reasoning-Aware Compression (RAC)方法，通过联合重构输入和思维链激活来改进推理语言模型的压缩性能，解决了传统剪枝方法在推理任务中效果不佳的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 推理语言模型（如DeepSeek-R1）在推理时产生长思维链轨迹，导致部署成本高昂。传统神经网络剪枝方法在推理任务中性能损失更大，甚至可能使模型更慢，因为标准LLM剪枝方法主要关注输入重构，而推理是解码主导的任务。

Method: 提出RAC方法：在剪枝过程中联合重构来自输入和模型策略思维链轨迹的激活。该方法可无缝集成到现有剪枝工作流（如SparseGPT）中。

Result: RAC显著提升了现有剪枝方法的性能，解决了传统剪枝在推理任务中的局限性。

Conclusion: RAC是一种简单有效的即插即用解决方案，通过考虑推理任务特性来改进模型压缩，在保持推理能力的同时降低部署成本。

Abstract: Reasoning language models such as DeepSeek-R1 produce long chain-of-thought
traces during inference time which make them costly to deploy at scale. We show
that using compression techniques such as neural network pruning produces
greater performance loss than in typical language modeling tasks, and in some
cases can make the model slower since they cause the model to produce more
thinking tokens but with worse performance. We show that this is partly due to
the fact that standard LLM pruning methods often focus on input reconstruction,
whereas reasoning is a decode-dominated task. We introduce a simple, drop-in
fix: during pruning we jointly reconstruct activations from the input and the
model's on-policy chain-of-thought traces. This "Reasoning-Aware Compression"
(RAC) integrates seamlessly into existing pruning workflows such as SparseGPT,
and boosts their performance significantly. Code reproducing the results in the

Motivation: 研究动机是建立认知科学和理论计算机科学之间的联系，通过物理拼图的分析来理解智能机制如何通过利用物质约束和认知策略来降低任务复杂度。

Method: 通过分析Soma立方体拼图的分支因子（搜索树出度）来量化任务难度，逐步改进试错搜索方法：包括预处理（认知组块化）、值排序（认知自由排序）、变量排序（认知支架）和剪枝（认知推理）。

Result: 研究发现有效的工具使用可以通过利用物理约束来降低时间复杂度，不同认知策略能够系统地修改问题复杂度。

Conclusion: 提出了一个将智能视为算法库的模型，该模型能够同时利用心智和物质的能力，通过"物质性原则"将计算复杂度概念与认知问题解决策略联系起来。

Abstract: Cognitive science and theoretical computer science both seek to classify and
explain the difficulty of tasks. Mechanisms of intelligence are those that
reduce task difficulty. Here we map concepts from the computational complexity
of a physical puzzle, the Soma Cube, onto cognitive problem-solving strategies
through a ``Principle of Materiality''. By analyzing the puzzle's branching
factor, measured through search tree outdegree, we quantitatively assess task
difficulty and systematically examine how different strategies modify
complexity. We incrementally refine a trial-and-error search by layering
preprocessing (cognitive chunking), value ordering (cognitive free-sorting),
variable ordering (cognitive scaffolding), and pruning (cognitive inference).
We discuss how the competent use of artifacts reduces effective time complexity
by exploiting physical constraints and propose a model of intelligence as a
library of algorithms that recruit the capabilities of both mind and matter.

Abstract: Sample size calculations for power analysis are critical for clinical
research and trial design, yet their complexity and reliance on statistical
expertise create barriers for many researchers. We introduce PowerGPT, an
AI-powered system integrating large language models (LLMs) with statistical
engines to automate test selection and sample size estimation in trial design.
In a randomized trial to evaluate its effectiveness, PowerGPT significantly
improved task completion rates (99.3% vs. 88.9% for test selection, 99.3% vs.
77.8% for sample size calculation) and accuracy (94.1% vs. 55.4% in sample size
estimation, p < 0.001), while reducing average completion time (4.0 vs. 9.3
minutes, p < 0.001). These gains were consistent across various statistical
tests and benefited both statisticians and non-statisticians as well as
bridging expertise gaps. Already under deployment across multiple institutions,
PowerGPT represents a scalable AI-driven approach that enhances accessibility,
efficiency, and accuracy in statistical power analysis for clinical research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 环岛虽能减少严重事故，但风险模式因条件而异，需要可解释的分析方法来理解不同条件下的事故机制和严重性驱动因素。

Method: 采用两步骤工作流：首先使用聚类对应分析(CCA)识别共现因素和四种事故模式，然后使用基于树的严重性模型并通过SHAP进行解释，量化模式内和跨模式的伤害驱动因素。

Result: 研究发现黑暗、湿滑路面和较高限速条件下发生固定物体或角度碰撞时严重性更高，而晴朗、低速条件下严重性较低。特定模式解释揭示了入口处(未能让行、间隙接受)、多车道循环内(不当操作)和减速期间(追尾)的机制。

Conclusion: 该工作流将模式发现与案例级解释相结合，支持场地筛查、对策选择和审计就绪报告，为公共安全分析提供了实用的可解释人工智能模板。

Abstract: Roundabouts reduce severe crashes, yet risk patterns vary by conditions. This
study analyzes 2017-2021 Ohio roundabout crashes using a two-step, explainable
workflow. Cluster Correspondence Analysis (CCA) identifies co-occurring factors
and yields four crash patterns. A tree-based severity model is then interpreted
with SHAP to quantify drivers of injury within and across patterns. Results
show higher severity when darkness, wet surfaces, and higher posted speeds
coincide with fixed-object or angle events, and lower severity in clear,
low-speed settings. Pattern-specific explanations highlight mechanisms at
entries (fail-to-yield, gap acceptance), within multi-lane circulation
(improper maneuvers), and during slow-downs (rear-end). The workflow links
pattern discovery with case-level explanations, supporting site screening,
countermeasure selection, and audit-ready reporting. The contribution to
Information Systems is a practical template for usable XAI in public safety
analytics.

Motivation: 传统客服系统存在处理时间长、首次解决率低、客户满意度差的问题，主要原因是客服人员面临认知负荷，需要操作碎片化系统并进行手动故障排除。现有的AI辅助工具多为被动响应，缺乏深度上下文推理能力。

Method: 开发了Minerva CQ系统，采用Agentic AI方法，集成了实时转录、意图和情感检测、实体识别、上下文检索、动态客户画像和部分对话摘要等功能，实现主动工作流和持续上下文构建。

Result: 在实时语音客服中部署的Minerva CQ作为AI副驾驶，在多个部署中显著提高了客服效率和客户体验，取得了可衡量的改进效果。

Conclusion: Agentic AI驱动的Minerva CCQ系统通过主动、目标驱动的自动化工具使用，有效解决了传统客服系统的局限性，为实时客服支持提供了创新的解决方案。

Abstract: Despite advances in AI for contact centers, customer experience (CX)
continues to suffer from high average handling time (AHT), low first-call
resolution, and poor customer satisfaction (CSAT). A key driver is the
cognitive load on agents, who must navigate fragmented systems, troubleshoot
manually, and frequently place customers on hold. Existing AI-powered
agent-assist tools are often reactive driven by static rules, simple prompting,
or retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) without deeper contextual reasoning. We
introduce Agentic AI goal-driven, autonomous, tool-using systems that
proactively support agents in real time. Unlike conventional approaches,
Agentic AI identifies customer intent, triggers modular workflows, maintains
evolving context, and adapts dynamically to conversation state. This paper
presents a case study of Minerva CQ, a real-time Agent Assist product deployed
in voice-based customer support. Minerva CQ integrates real-time transcription,
intent and sentiment detection, entity recognition, contextual retrieval,
dynamic customer profiling, and partial conversational summaries enabling
proactive workflows and continuous context-building. Deployed in live
production, Minerva CQ acts as an AI co-pilot, delivering measurable
improvements in agent efficiency and customer experience across multiple
deployments.

Abstract: We present Match Chat, a real-time, agent-driven assistant designed to
enhance the tennis fan experience by delivering instant, accurate responses to
match-related queries. Match Chat integrates Generative Artificial Intelligence
(GenAI) with Generative Computing (GenComp) techniques to synthesize key
insights during live tennis singles matches. The system debuted at the 2025
Wimbledon Championships and the 2025 US Open, where it provided about 1 million
users with seamless access to streaming and static data through natural
language queries. The architecture is grounded in an Agent-Oriented
Architecture (AOA) combining rule engines, predictive models, and agents to
pre-process and optimize user queries before passing them to GenAI components.
The Match Chat system had an answer accuracy of 92.83% with an average response
time of 6.25 seconds under loads of up to 120 requests per second (RPS). Over
96.08% of all queries were guided using interactive prompt design, contributing
to a user experience that prioritized clarity, responsiveness, and minimal
effort. The system was designed to mask architectural complexity, offering a
frictionless and intuitive interface that required no onboarding or technical
familiarity. Across both Grand Slam deployments, Match Chat maintained 100%
uptime and supported nearly 1 million unique users, underscoring the

TL;DR: DaSAThco是一个基于大语言模型的框架，能够从SAT问题实例特征学习到定制化启发式集成的通用映射，实现训练一次、广泛适应的模型，在领域外泛化方面表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的自动化方法虽然能为特定问题族找到专用配置，但这种数据集特定方法缺乏泛化性，且对新问题类型需要昂贵的重新优化。CDCL求解器性能依赖于内部启发式，但SAT问题的异质性使得单一通用最优配置不可实现。

Method: 使用大语言模型，在系统定义的问题原型指导下生成多样化的专用启发式集成组合，然后学习自适应选择机制形成最终映射。

Result: 实验表明DaSAThco实现了优越性能，最重要的是在非自适应方法表现有限的情况下展示了强大的领域外泛化能力。

Conclusion: 这项工作为复杂可配置系统的自动化算法设计建立了更可扩展和实用的路径。

Abstract: The performance of Conflict-Driven Clause Learning solvers hinges on internal
heuristics, yet the heterogeneity of SAT problems makes a single, universally
optimal configuration unattainable. While prior automated methods can find
specialized configurations for specific problem families, this dataset-specific
approach lacks generalizability and requires costly re-optimization for new
problem types. We introduce DaSAThco, a framework that addresses this challenge
by learning a generalizable mapping from instance features to tailored
heuristic ensembles, enabling a train-once, adapt-broadly model. Our framework
uses a Large Language Model, guided by systematically defined Problem
Archetypes, to generate a diverse portfolio of specialized heuristic ensembles
and subsequently learns an adaptive selection mechanism to form the final
mapping. Experiments show that DaSAThco achieves superior performance and, most
notably, demonstrates robust out-of-domain generalization where non-adaptive
methods show limitations. Our work establishes a more scalable and practical
path toward automated algorithm design for complex, configurable systems.

TL;DR: AD-FCoT是一个通过类比推理和思维链提示相结合的金融情感分析框架，无需额外训练即可提升LLM在金融新闻情感分析的准确性和市场相关性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有金融情感分析方法难以捕捉复杂经济背景且缺乏透明推理，影响可靠性。LLM虽具备强大文本理解能力，但需要更好的方法来处理金融领域的特定需求。

Method: 提出类比驱动的金融思维链(AD-FCoT)提示框架，引导LLM在新事件与历史情景之间建立类比，并将这些类比嵌入结构化的逐步推理链中，无需额外训练数据或微调。

Result: 在数千篇新闻文章上的实验显示，AD-FCoT在情感分类准确性上优于强基线方法，与市场回报的相关性显著更高，生成的解释与领域专业知识一致。

Conclusion: AD-FCoT成功将类比推理与思维链提示结合，为金融情感分析提供了可解释且有效的解决方案，适用于实际金融分析场景。

Abstract: Financial news sentiment analysis is crucial for anticipating market
movements. With the rise of AI techniques such as Large Language Models (LLMs),
which demonstrate strong text understanding capabilities, there has been
renewed interest in enhancing these systems. Existing methods, however, often
struggle to capture the complex economic context of news and lack transparent
reasoning, which undermines their reliability. We propose Analogy-Driven
Financial Chain-of-Thought (AD-FCoT), a prompting framework that integrates
analogical reasoning with chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting for sentiment
prediction on historical financial news. AD-FCoT guides LLMs to draw parallels
between new events and relevant historical scenarios with known outcomes,
embedding these analogies into a structured, step-by-step reasoning chain. To
our knowledge, this is among the first approaches to explicitly combine
analogical examples with CoT reasoning in finance. Operating purely through
prompting, AD-FCoT requires no additional training data or fine-tuning and
leverages the model's internal financial knowledge to generate rationales that
mirror human analytical reasoning. Experiments on thousands of news articles
show that AD-FCoT outperforms strong baselines in sentiment classification
accuracy and achieves substantially higher correlation with market returns. Its
generated explanations also align with domain expertise, providing
interpretable insights suitable for real-world financial analysis.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决大型语言模型在Text2SQL生成中存在的语义差距问题，即语法正确的SQL查询可能误解用户意图，同时发现当前基准测试数据质量差的问题。

Method: 提出GBV-SQL多智能体框架，采用引导生成和SQL2Text反向翻译验证机制，使用专门代理将生成的SQL翻译回自然语言以验证逻辑一致性。

Result: 在BIRD基准上达到63.23%的执行准确率（提升5.8%），在去除错误样本后的Spider基准上达到96.5%（开发集）和97.6%（测试集）的执行准确率。

Conclusion: 该工作不仅提供了语义验证的鲁棒框架，还批判性地指出了基准测试完整性问题，强调了更严格数据集策展的必要性。

Abstract: While Large Language Models have significantly advanced Text2SQL generation,
a critical semantic gap persists where syntactically valid queries often
misinterpret user intent. To mitigate this challenge, we propose GBV-SQL, a
novel multi-agent framework that introduces Guided Generation with SQL2Text
Back-translation Validation. This mechanism uses a specialized agent to
translate the generated SQL back into natural language, which verifies its
logical alignment with the original question. Critically, our investigation
reveals that current evaluation is undermined by a systemic issue: the poor
quality of the benchmarks themselves. We introduce a formal typology for "Gold
Errors", which are pervasive flaws in the ground-truth data, and demonstrate
how they obscure true model performance. On the challenging BIRD benchmark,
GBV-SQL achieves 63.23% execution accuracy, a 5.8% absolute improvement. After
removing flawed examples, GBV-SQL achieves 96.5% (dev) and 97.6% (test)
execution accuracy on the Spider benchmark. Our work offers both a robust
framework for semantic validation and a critical perspective on benchmark
integrity, highlighting the need for more rigorous dataset curation.

Abstract: Forecasting mob based cattle weight gain (MB CWG) may benefit large livestock
farms, allowing farmers to refine their feeding strategies, make educated
breeding choices, and reduce risks linked to climate variability and market
fluctuations. In this paper, a novel technique termed MB CWG is proposed to
forecast the one month advanced weight gain of herd based cattle using
historical data collected from the Charles Sturt University Farm. This research
employs a Random Forest (RF) model, comparing its performance against Support
Vector Regression (SVR) and Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) models for monthly
weight gain prediction. Four datasets were used to evaluate the performance of
models, using 756 sample data from 108 herd-based cattle, along with weather
data (rainfall and temperature) influencing CWG. The RF model performs better
than the SVR and LSTM models across all datasets, achieving an R^2 of 0.973,
RMSE of 0.040, and MAE of 0.033 when both weather and age factors were
included. The results indicate that including both weather and age factors
significantly improves the accuracy of weight gain predictions, with the RF
model outperforming the SVR and LSTM models in all scenarios. These findings
demonstrate the potential of RF as a robust tool for forecasting cattle weight
gain in variable conditions, highlighting the influence of age and climatic
factors on herd based weight trends. This study has also developed an
innovative automated pre processing tool to generate a benchmark dataset for MB
CWG predictive models. The tool is publicly available on GitHub and can assist
in preparing datasets for current and future analytical research..

*Yong Xia,Jingxuan Li,YeTeng Sun,Jiarui Bu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ECG-aBcDe是一种创新的ECG编码方法，将心电图信号转换为通用ECG语言，使任何大语言模型都能直接解释，解决了现有方法在可迁移性、时间尺度信息学习和可解释性方面的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前LLM在ECG分析中存在三个主要问题：模型特定的ECG编码器阻碍跨LLM迁移、Transformer架构难以捕捉ECG关键时间尺度信息、黑盒特性限制临床应用。

Method: 提出ECG-aBcDe编码方法，构建ECG语言和自然语言的混合数据集，无需修改架构即可直接微调预训练LLM，实现双向可转换性以提取注意力热图，并显式表示时间尺度信息。

Result: 在ROUGE-L和METEOR上达到竞争性性能，BLEU-4指标显著提升（数据集内提升2.8倍至42.58，跨数据集提升3.9倍至30.76），证明了新范式的可行性。

Conclusion: ECG-aBcDe为ECG分析与LLM集成提供了新范式，实现了"一次构建，随处使用"的能力，显著提升了可解释性和时间信息处理能力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) hold significant promise for electrocardiogram
(ECG) analysis, yet challenges remain regarding transferability, time-scale
information learning, and interpretability. Current methods suffer from
model-specific ECG encoders, hindering transfer across LLMs. Furthermore, LLMs
struggle to capture crucial time-scale information inherent in ECGs due to
Transformer limitations. And their black-box nature limits clinical adoption.
To address these limitations, we introduce ECG-aBcDe, a novel ECG encoding
method that transforms ECG signals into a universal ECG language readily
interpretable by any LLM. By constructing a hybrid dataset of ECG language and
natural language, ECG-aBcDe enables direct fine-tuning of pre-trained LLMs
without architectural modifications, achieving "construct once, use anywhere"
capability. Moreover, the bidirectional convertibility between ECG and ECG
language of ECG-aBcDe allows for extracting attention heatmaps from ECG
signals, significantly enhancing interpretability. Finally, ECG-aBcDe
explicitly represents time-scale information, mitigating Transformer
limitations. This work presents a new paradigm for integrating ECG analysis
with LLMs. Compared with existing methods, our method achieves competitive
performance on ROUGE-L and METEOR. Notably, it delivers significant
improvements in the BLEU-4, with improvements of 2.8 times and 3.9 times in
in-dataset and cross-dataset evaluations, respectively, reaching scores of
42.58 and 30.76. These results provide strong evidence for the feasibility of
the new paradigm.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: AutoCO是一种端到端的自动化约束优化方法，利用大型语言模型生成约束松弛策略，结合进化算法和蒙特卡洛树搜索的双向协同进化机制，有效解决非线性组合优化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统约束松弛方法依赖专家驱动的迭代设计，缺乏系统自动化和可扩展性。现有的LLM优化方法主要作为被动约束验证器，无法处理NCOPs中复杂的约束交互。

Method: 利用结构化LLM推理生成约束松弛策略，通过统一的三重表示方案动态演化算法原理和可执行代码。建立双向（全局-局部）协同进化机制，将进化算法与蒙特卡洛树搜索相结合。

Result: 在三个具有挑战性的NCOP基准测试上的综合实验验证了AutoCO的一致有效性和优于基线的性能。

Conclusion: AutoCO通过LLM学习松弛约束的方法，为非线性组合优化问题提供了革命性的解决方案，在碎片化解空间中实现了强化和多样化的最优平衡。

Abstract: Nonlinear Combinatorial Optimization Problems (NCOPs) present a formidable
computational hurdle in practice, as their nonconvex nature gives rise to
multi-modal solution spaces that defy efficient optimization. Traditional
constraint relaxation approaches rely heavily on expert-driven, iterative
design processes that lack systematic automation and scalable adaptability.
While recent Large Language Model (LLM)-based optimization methods show promise
for autonomous problem-solving, they predominantly function as passive
constraint validators rather than proactive strategy architects, failing to
handle the sophisticated constraint interactions inherent to NCOPs.To address
these limitations, we introduce the first end-to-end \textbf{Auto}mated
\textbf{C}onstraint \textbf{O}ptimization (AutoCO) method, which revolutionizes
NCOPs resolution through learning to relax with LLMs.Specifically, we leverage
structured LLM reasoning to generate constraint relaxation strategies, which
are dynamically evolving with algorithmic principles and executable code
through a unified triple-representation scheme. We further establish a novel
bidirectional (global-local) coevolution mechanism that synergistically
integrates Evolutionary Algorithms for intensive local refinement with Monte
Carlo Tree Search for systematic global strategy space exploration, ensuring
optimal balance between intensification and diversification in fragmented
solution spaces. Finally, comprehensive experiments on three challenging NCOP
benchmarks validate AutoCO's consistent effectiveness and superior performance
over the baselines.

Motivation: 评估大语言模型随时间推移的推理能力变化，并探索更高效的推理方法以减少计算资源消耗。

Method: 使用PrOntoQA数据集的真假问题测试三个领先模型，采用思维链提示和思维模型技术，并开发神经符号架构将问题转化为标准化形式后用Z3求解器处理。

Result: 从2023年到2024年性能提升归因于隐藏思维链提示，2024年到2025年思维模型带来显著改进。神经符号方法在保持近乎完美性能的同时显著降低计算成本。

Conclusion: 大语言模型的推理能力随时间持续提升，神经符号架构为高效推理提供了可行方案，计算成本估算公式在实际应用中准确度较高。

Abstract: We present a longitudinal study which evaluates the reasoning capability of
frontier Large Language Models over an eighteen month period. We measured the
accuracy of three leading models from December 2023, September 2024 and June
2025 on true or false questions from the PrOntoQA dataset and their
faithfulness to reasoning strategies provided through in-context learning. The
improvement in performance from 2023 to 2024 can be attributed to hidden Chain
of Thought prompting. The introduction of thinking models allowed for
significant improvement in model performance between 2024 and 2025.
  We then present a neuro-symbolic architecture which uses LLMs of less than 15
billion parameters to translate the problems into a standardised form. We then
parse the standardised forms of the problems into a program to be solved by Z3,
an SMT solver, to determine the satisfiability of the query. We report the
number of prompt and completion tokens as well as the computational cost in
FLOPs for open source models. The neuro-symbolic approach significantly reduces
the computational cost while maintaining near perfect performance. The common
approximation that the number of inference FLOPs is double the product of the
active parameters and total tokens was accurate within 10\% for all
experiments.

TL;DR: GRRAF是一个无需训练的图推理方法，利用检索增强生成(RAG)和LLM的代码生成能力，通过生成可执行查询代码从图数据库中检索信息，在多种图推理任务上达到100%准确率，并能扩展到10,000个节点的大图。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图推理方法需要大量微调或依赖预定义算法，存在局限性。GRRAF旨在开发一种无需训练、通用的图推理框架，克服这些限制。

Method: 将目标图存储在图形数据库中，提示LLM生成可执行代码查询来检索必要信息，包含错误反馈循环和超时机制确保正确性和效率。

Result: 在GraphInstruct数据集上，大多数图推理任务达到100%准确率（包括环检测、二分图检查、最短路径计算、最大流等），子图匹配性能也很高，能有效扩展到10,000个节点的大图，且token成本与图大小无关。

Conclusion: GRRAF提供了一种高效、准确且可扩展的训练免费图推理解决方案，通过结合RAG和LLM的代码生成能力，成功解决了传统方法的局限性。

Abstract: We propose a new, training-free method, Graph Reasoning via Retrieval
Augmented Framework (GRRAF), that harnesses retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG) alongside the code-generation capabilities of large language models
(LLMs) to address a wide range of graph reasoning tasks. In GRRAF, the target
graph is stored in a graph database, and the LLM is prompted to generate
executable code queries that retrieve the necessary information. This approach
circumvents the limitations of existing methods that require extensive
finetuning or depend on predefined algorithms, and it incorporates an error
feedback loop with a time-out mechanism to ensure both correctness and
efficiency. Experimental evaluations on the GraphInstruct dataset reveal that
GRRAF achieves 100% accuracy on most graph reasoning tasks, including cycle
detection, bipartite graph checks, shortest path computation, and maximum flow,
while maintaining consistent token costs regardless of graph sizes. Imperfect
but still very high performance is observed on subgraph matching. Notably,
GRRAF scales effectively to large graphs with up to 10,000 nodes.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出分层记忆架构H²R，通过分离高层规划记忆和低层执行记忆实现细粒度知识迁移，提升LLM智能体在多任务场景中的泛化能力和决策性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将先验经验和知识视为整体单元，导致知识迁移效率低下且粒度粗糙，需要更精细的知识迁移机制

Method: 分层记忆架构：高层规划记忆+低层执行记忆；分层事后反思机制(H²R)从过往交互中提炼可重用分层知识；测试时分别检索高低层记忆

Result: 在两个基准测试中表现优于Expel等基线方法，提高了泛化能力和决策性能

Conclusion: H²R通过分层记忆架构实现了更细粒度的知识迁移，有效提升了LLM智能体在多任务场景中的性能表现

Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-based agents have shown strong potential in
multi-task scenarios, owing to their ability to transfer knowledge across
diverse tasks. However, existing approaches often treat prior experiences and
knowledge as monolithic units, leading to inefficient and coarse-grained
knowledge transfer. In this work, we propose a novel hierarchical memory
architecture that enables fine-grained knowledge transfer by decoupling
high-level planning memory from low-level execution memory. To construct and
refine these hierarchical memories, we introduce Hierarchical Hindsight
Reflection (H$^2$R), a mechanism that distills reusable and hierarchical
knowledge from past agent-environment interactions. At test time, H$^2$R
performs retrievals of high-level and low-level memories separately, allowing
LLM-based agents to efficiently access and utilize task-relevant knowledge for
new tasks.Experimental results across two benchmarks demonstrate that H$^2$R
can improve generalization and decision-making performance, outperforming prior
baselines such as Expel.

TL;DR: LTA-Thinker是一个潜在思维增强训练框架，通过可学习先验的潜在思维生成架构和基于分布的方向性优化范式，提高大语言模型的复杂推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法如Coconut和SoftCoT在连续潜在空间推理中有效，但高质量潜在思维的生成和利用仍是核心瓶颈。SoftCoT++理论表明，潜在思维分布的更大方差更接近真实分布，因此需要提高分布方差来增强推理性能。

Method: 1. 基于可学习先验构建潜在思维生成架构，增加生成潜在思维向量的方差分布；2. 引入基于分布的方向性优化范式，联合约束分布局部性和分布规模，结合SFT损失、语义对齐损失（KL散度）和推理焦点损失（对比学习机制）进行多目标协同训练。

Result: 实验表明LTA-Thinker在各种基线中实现了最先进的性能，表现出更高的性能上限和更好的扩展效果。

Conclusion: LTA-Thinker通过提高潜在思维分布的方差和优化分布特性，有效提升了大语言模型的复杂推理能力，为动态优化推理过程提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Complex Reasoning in Large Language Models can be dynamically optimized using
Test-Time Scaling (TTS) to mitigate Overthinking. Methods such as Coconut,
SoftCoT and its variant are effective in continuous latent space inference, the
core bottleneck still lies in the efficient generation and utilization of
high-quality Latent Thought. Drawing from the theory of SoftCoT++ that a larger
variance in the generated Latent Thought distribution more closely approximates
the golden truth distribution, we propose a Latent Thought-Augmented Training
Framework--LTA-Thinker, which improves distributional variance and enhances
reasoning performance from two perspectives. First, LTA-Thinker constructs a
Latent Thought generation architecture based on a learnable prior. This
architecture aims to increase the variance distribution of generated Latent
Thought Vectors in order to simplify the overall structure and raise the
performance ceiling. Second, LTA-Thinker introduces a distribution-based
directional optimization paradigm that jointly constrains both distribution
locality and distribution scale. This mechanism improves information efficiency
and computational cost through a multi-objective co-training strategy, which
combines standard Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) loss with two novel losses:
Semantic Alignment Loss, which utilizes KL divergence to ensure that the Latent
Thought is highly relevant to the semantics of the question; Reasoning Focus
Loss, which utilizes a contrastive learning mechanism to guide the model to
focus on the most critical reasoning steps. Experiments show that LTA-thinker
achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance among various baselines and
demonstrates a higher performance ceiling and better scaling effects.

Abstract: Population estimation is crucial for various applications, from resource
allocation to urban planning. Traditional methods such as surveys and censuses
are expensive, time-consuming and also heavily dependent on human resources,
requiring significant manpower for data collection and processing. In this
study a deep learning solution is proposed to estimate population using high
resolution (0.3 m) satellite imagery, Digital Elevation Models (DEM) of 0.5m
resolution and vector boundaries. Proposed method combines Convolution Neural
Network (CNN) architecture for classification task to classify buildings as
residential and non-residential and Artificial Neural Network (ANN)
architecture to estimate the population. Approx. 48k building footprints over
Gandhinagar urban area are utilized containing both residential and
non-residential, with residential categories further used for building-level
population estimation. Experimental results on a large-scale dataset
demonstrate the effectiveness of our model, achieving an impressive overall
F1-score of 0.9936. The proposed system employs advanced geospatial analysis
with high spatial resolution to estimate Gandhinagar population at 278,954. By
integrating real-time data updates, standardized metrics, and infrastructure
planning capabilities, this automated approach addresses critical limitations
of conventional census-based methodologies. The framework provides

Motivation: 现有MARL基准如SMAC主要关注微操层面，缺乏对高层战略智能的全面评估，需要新的基准来测试多智能体的战略决策能力。

Method: 基于三十六计设计12个星际争霸II场景，每个对应一个具体计策，引入多维度评估指标（能力利用率、推进效率等），集成先进MARL算法和LLM智能体进行实验验证。

Abstract: Benchmarks are crucial for assessing multi-agent reinforcement learning
(MARL) algorithms. While StarCraft II-related environments have driven
significant advances in MARL, existing benchmarks like SMAC focus primarily on
micromanagement, limiting comprehensive evaluation of high-level strategic
intelligence. To address this, we introduce HLSMAC, a new cooperative MARL
benchmark with 12 carefully designed StarCraft II scenarios based on classical
stratagems from the Thirty-Six Stratagems. Each scenario corresponds to a
specific stratagem and is designed to challenge agents with diverse strategic
elements, including tactical maneuvering, timing coordination, and deception,
thereby opening up avenues for evaluating high-level strategic decision-making
capabilities. We also propose novel metrics across multiple dimensions beyond
conventional win rate, such as ability utilization and advancement efficiency,
to assess agents' overall performance within the HLSMAC environment. We
integrate state-of-the-art MARL algorithms and LLM-based agents with our
benchmark and conduct comprehensive experiments. The results demonstrate that
HLSMAC serves as a robust testbed for advancing multi-agent strategic
decision-making.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RLHF方法导致参数变化不透明，难以理解模型内部学到了什么，需要更透明的对齐方法来诊断对齐机制。

Method: 使用特征引导强化学习（FSRL），训练轻量级适配器来调节稀疏自编码器（SAE）提取的可解释特征，实现行为引导。

Result: FSRL在偏好优化方面与现有RLHF方法效果相当，机制分析发现适配器策略更倾向于提升风格特征而非明确的对齐概念。

Conclusion: FSRL为可解释的模型控制和诊断对齐机制提供了工具，发现偏好优化过程可能将风格呈现作为质量的代理来奖励。

Abstract: Aligning large language models is critical for their usability and safety.
However, the prevailing approach of Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback
(RLHF) induces diffuse, opaque parameter changes, making it difficult to
discern what the model has internalized. Hence, we introduce Feature Steering
with Reinforcement Learning (FSRL), a transparent alignment framework that
trains a lightweight adapter to steer behavior by modulating interpretable
features from a Sparse Autoencoder (SAE). First, we demonstrate that FSRL is an
effective method for preference optimization and is comparable with current
RLHF methods. We then perform mechanistic analysis on the trained adapter, and
find that its policy systematically promotes style features over explicit
alignment concepts, suggesting that the preference optimization process rewards
stylistic presentation as a proxy for quality. Ultimately, we hope that FSRL
provides a tool for both interpretable model control and diagnosing the
internal mechanisms of alignment.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型融合方法需要访问模型参数，但对于GPT-4等仅通过API提供的黑盒大语言模型，模型权重不可用，这给模型融合带来重大挑战

Method: 基于进化算法的无导数优化框架，包含稀疏性去噪和符号感知缩放两个关键组件，通过推理API查询实现模型融合

Result: 在多个任务上达到最先进性能，显著优于现有强基线方法

Conclusion: Evo-Merging方法有效解决了黑盒大语言模型融合的挑战，为仅通过API访问的模型提供了实用的融合解决方案

Abstract: Model merging refers to the process of integrating multiple distinct models
into a unified model that preserves and combines the strengths and capabilities
of the individual models. Most existing approaches rely on task vectors to
combine models, typically under the assumption that model parameters are
accessible. However, for extremely large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4,
which are often provided solely as black-box services through API interfaces
(Language-Model-as-a-Service), model weights are not available to end users.
This presents a significant challenge, which we refer to as black-box model
merging (BMM) with massive LLMs. To address this challenge, we propose a
derivative-free optimization framework based on the evolutionary algorithm
(Evo-Merging) that enables effective model merging using only inference-time
API queries. Our method consists of two key components: (1) sparsity-based
denoising, designed to identify and filter out irrelevant or redundant
information across models, and (2) sign-aware scaling, which dynamically
computes optimal combination weights for the relevant models based on their
performance. We also provide a formal justification, along with a theoretical
analysis, for our asymmetric sparsification. Extensive experimental evaluations
demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on a range of
tasks, significantly outperforming existing strong baselines.

Method: 1. 引入token级动态差分隐私策略，根据语义敏感性自适应分配隐私预算；2. 集成隐私引导的记忆雕刻模块，智能遗忘敏感信息同时保留任务不变的历史知识

Result: 实验表明PeCL在隐私保护和模型效用之间取得了优越的平衡，在保持先前任务高精度的同时确保强大的隐私保护

Conclusion: PeCL框架有效解决了持续学习中的隐私保护问题，为隐私敏感领域的持续学习应用提供了可行方案

Abstract: Continual Learning (CL) models, while adept at sequential knowledge
acquisition, face significant and often overlooked privacy challenges due to
accumulating diverse information. Traditional privacy methods, like a uniform
Differential Privacy (DP) budget, indiscriminately protect all data, leading to
substantial model utility degradation and hindering CL deployment in
privacy-sensitive areas. To overcome this, we propose a privacy-enhanced
continual learning (PeCL) framework that forgets what's sensitive and remembers
what matters. Our approach first introduces a token-level dynamic Differential
Privacy strategy that adaptively allocates privacy budgets based on the
semantic sensitivity of individual tokens. This ensures robust protection for
private entities while minimizing noise injection for non-sensitive, general
knowledge. Second, we integrate a privacy-guided memory sculpting module. This
module leverages the sensitivity analysis from our dynamic DP mechanism to
intelligently forget sensitive information from the model's memory and
parameters, while explicitly preserving the task-invariant historical knowledge
crucial for mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Extensive experiments show that
PeCL achieves a superior balance between privacy preserving and model utility,
outperforming baseline models by maintaining high accuracy on previous tasks
while ensuring robust privacy.

Motivation: 大型语言模型(LLMs)作为自主代理执行复杂任务时，缺乏可靠的长期规划能力，需要解决这一能力缺口。

Method: 利用模型上下文协议(MCP)标准将LLMs与外部规划工具集成，支持语法检查、规划器选择、调用、计划验证和执行模拟等任务，无需领域特定微调。

Result: 实证评估显示Planning Copilot在使用三个开源LLMs时表现远超无工具支持的相同LLMs，在有限定性比较中甚至显著优于GPT-5。

Conclusion: 专用规划工具是使LLMs有效执行规划任务的有效途径，MCP协议为LLMs与外部工具集成提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being used as autonomous agents
capable of performing complicated tasks. However, they lack the ability to
perform reliable long-horizon planning on their own. This paper bridges this
gap by introducing the Planning Copilot, a chatbot that integrates multiple
planning tools and allows users to invoke them through instructions in natural
language. The Planning Copilot leverages the Model Context Protocol (MCP), a
recently developed standard for connecting LLMs with external tools and
systems. This approach allows using any LLM that supports MCP without
domain-specific fine-tuning. Our Planning Copilot supports common planning
tasks such as checking the syntax of planning problems, selecting an
appropriate planner, calling it, validating the plan it generates, and
simulating their execution. We empirically evaluate the ability of our Planning
Copilot to perform these tasks using three open-source LLMs. The results show
that the Planning Copilot highly outperforms using the same LLMs without the
planning tools. We also conducted a limited qualitative comparison of our tool
against Chat GPT-5, a very recent commercial LLM. Our results shows that our
Planning Copilot significantly outperforms GPT-5 despite relying on a much
smaller LLM. This suggests dedicated planning tools may be an effective way to
enable LLMs to perform planning tasks.

Conclusion: 成功依赖于特定媒介的结构约束，而失败在不同领域呈现不同形态，结构原则具有媒介特异性

Abstract: The Anna Karenina Principle (AKP) holds that success requires satisfying a
small set of essential conditions, whereas failure takes diverse forms. We test
AKP, its reverse, and two further patterns described as ordered and noisy
across novels, online encyclopedias, research papers, and movies. Texts are
represented as sequences of functional blocks, and convergence is assessed in
transition order and position. Results show that structural principles vary by
medium: novels follow reverse AKP in order, Wikipedia combines AKP with ordered
patterns, academic papers display reverse AKP in order but remain noisy in
position, and movies diverge by genre. Success therefore depends on structural
constraints that are specific to each medium, while failure assumes different
shapes across domains.

*Yuyang Tian,Shunqiang Mao,Wenchang Gao,Lanlan Qiu,Tianxing He*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MiniAgentPro是一个可视化平台，用于评估LLM代理在物理环境中的事件组织和协调能力，包含地图编辑器和模拟播放器，通过8个不同事件场景的测试集验证性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM代理框架缺乏对事件组织的系统评估，且缺少与物理环境的可视化集成，限制了代理在空间中导航和与物品真实交互的能力。

Method: 开发MiniAgentPro可视化平台，包含直观的地图编辑器和带有流畅动画的模拟播放器，并构建包含8个多样事件场景（基础版和困难版）的综合测试集。

Result: 使用GPT-4o进行评估，显示在基础设置中表现强劲，但在困难变体中突显了协调挑战。

Conclusion: MiniAgentPro为LLM代理在物理环境中的事件组织能力提供了有效的评估工具，揭示了当前模型在复杂协调任务中的局限性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized the simulation of agent
societies, enabling autonomous planning, memory formation, and social
interactions. However, existing frameworks often overlook systematic
evaluations for event organization and lack visualized integration with
physically grounded environments, limiting agents' ability to navigate spaces
and interact with items realistically. We develop MiniAgentPro, a visualization
platform featuring an intuitive map editor for customizing environments and a
simulation player with smooth animations. Based on this tool, we introduce a
comprehensive test set comprising eight diverse event scenarios with basic and
hard variants to assess agents' ability. Evaluations using GPT-4o demonstrate
strong performance in basic settings but highlight coordination challenges in
hard variants.

*Marylou Fauchard,Florian Carichon,Margarida Carvalho,Golnoosh Farnadi*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个包含369个大学录取问题实例的新基准，用于评估大语言模型在匹配问题中的表现，发现推理型LLMs表现优于传统模型，但不同提示策略效果不一，且迭代提示性能不稳定。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然大语言模型在数学推理任务上表现出色，但在需要偏好和结构约束的匹配问题中的应用仍未被充分探索，因此需要建立专门的评估基准。

Method: 创建了大学录取问题基准，评估多个开源LLMs在可行性、稳定性和最优性三个维度上的表现，测试了Chain-of-Thought、In-Context Learning和基于角色的提示等策略。

Result: LLMs能够满足某些约束但难以一致满足所有评估标准；推理型模型（如QwQ和GPT-oss）显著优于传统模型；不同提示策略效果差异大；迭代提示性能非单调，可能早期达到峰值后显著下降。

Conclusion: 该研究为模型推理性能和提示策略在具有偏好约束的组合优化问题中的有效性提供了新的视角，揭示了当前LLMs在匹配问题上的局限性。

Abstract: Recent advances in reasoning with large language models (LLMs) have
demonstrated strong performance on complex mathematical tasks, including
combinatorial optimization. Techniques such as Chain-of-Thought and In-Context
Learning have further enhanced this capability, making LLMs both powerful and
accessible tools for a wide range of users, including non-experts. However,
applying LLMs to matching problems, which require reasoning under preferential
and structural constraints, remains underexplored. To address this gap, we
introduce a novel benchmark of 369 instances of the College Admission Problem,
a canonical example of a matching problem with preferences, to evaluate LLMs
across key dimensions: feasibility, stability, and optimality. We employ this
benchmark to assess the performance of several open-weight LLMs. Our results
first reveal that while LLMs can satisfy certain constraints, they struggle to
meet all evaluation criteria consistently. They also show that reasoning LLMs,
like QwQ and GPT-oss, significantly outperform traditional models such as
Llama, Qwen or Mistral, defined here as models used without any dedicated
reasoning mechanisms. Moreover, we observed that LLMs reacted differently to
the various prompting strategies tested, which include Chain-of-Thought,
In-Context Learning and role-based prompting, with no prompt consistently
offering the best performance. Finally, we report the performances from
iterative prompting with auto-generated feedback and show that they are not
monotonic; they can peak early and then significantly decline in later
attempts. Overall, this work offers a new perspective on model reasoning
performance and the effectiveness of prompting strategies in combinatorial
optimization problems with preferential constraints.

*Henrik Axelsen,Valdemar Licht,Jan Damsgaard*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文介绍了一种用于金融犯罪合规的智能AI系统，通过自动化工作流程和强调可解释性、可追溯性来提升合规效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 金融犯罪合规成本不断上升但效果有限，现有AI解决方案不透明且不符合监管要求，需要开发更有效的合规系统。

Method: 采用行动设计研究(ADR)方法，与金融科技公司和监管机构合作，使用工件中心建模，为自主代理分配明确角色，实现任务特定模型路由和审计日志。

Result: 开发了参考架构和实际原型，展示了智能AI如何在监管约束下重构金融犯罪合规工作流程，支持透明度和机构信任。

Conclusion: 研究表明，在负责任治理结构内嵌入自动化可以支持高风险监管环境中的透明度和机构信任，为AI驱动的合规研究提供了新见解。

Abstract: The cost and complexity of financial crime compliance (FCC) continue to rise,
often without measurable improvements in effectiveness. While AI offers
potential, most solutions remain opaque and poorly aligned with regulatory
expectations. This paper presents the design and deployment of an agentic AI
system for FCC in digitally native financial platforms. Developed through an
Action Design Research (ADR) process with a fintech firm and regulatory
stakeholders, the system automates onboarding, monitoring, investigation, and
reporting, emphasizing explainability, traceability, and compliance-by-design.
Using artifact-centric modeling, it assigns clearly bounded roles to autonomous
agents and enables task-specific model routing and audit logging. The
contribution includes a reference architecture, a real-world prototype, and
insights into how Agentic AI can reconfigure FCC workflows under regulatory
constraints. Our findings extend IS literature on AI-enabled compliance by
demonstrating how automation, when embedded within accountable governance
structures, can support transparency and institutional trust in high-stakes,
regulated environments.

*Kanishk Garg,Saranya D.,Sanal Kumar,Saurabh Singh,Anupam Purwar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出基于图的冲突集提取算法G-CSEA，用于高效识别伪布尔约束模型中的不可行子集，解决传统方法在调度问题中计算开销大的问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 劳动力调度中存在大量基于规则的约束，这些约束可能相互冲突导致模型不可行。现有IIS提取方法如Additive Deletion和QuickXplain需要大量可行性检查，计算成本高；对偶射线分析在伪布尔模型中也存在局限性

Method: 提出Graph-based Conflict Set Extraction Algorithm (G-CSEA)，受SAT求解器中冲突驱动子句学习启发，在约束传播过程中构建蕴含图，检测冲突时追踪所有决策分支中的贡献约束，生成冲突集，并可选择使用QuickXplain最小化为IIS

Result: G-CSEA方法能够有效提取冲突集，相比传统方法减少了求解器调用次数，提高了不可行性诊断效率

Conclusion: G-CSEA为伪布尔约束模型提供了一种高效的不可行子集提取方法，特别适用于包含复杂调度规则的劳动力调度问题，有助于快速识别和解决约束冲突

Abstract: Workforce scheduling involves a variety of rule-based constraints-such as
shift limits, staffing policies, working hour restrictions, and many similar
scheduling rules-which can interact in conflicting ways, leading to infeasible
models. Identifying the underlying causes of such infeasibility is critical for
resolving scheduling issues and restoring feasibility. A common diagnostic
approach is to compute Irreducible Infeasible Subsets (IISs): minimal sets of
constraints that are jointly infeasible but become feasible when any one is
removed. We consider models formulated using pseudo-Boolean constraints with
inequality relations over binary variables, which naturally encode scheduling
logic. Existing IIS extraction methods such as Additive Deletion and
QuickXplain rely on repeated feasibility checks, often incurring large numbers
of solver calls. Dual ray analysis, while effective for LP-based models, may
fail when the relaxed problem is feasible but the underlying pseudo-Boolean
model is not. To address these limitations, we propose Graph-based Conflict Set
Extraction Algorithm (G-CSEA) to extract a conflict set, an approach inspired
by Conflict-Driven Clause Learning (CDCL) in SAT solvers. Our method constructs
an implication graph during constraint propagation and, upon detecting a
conflict, traces all contributing constraints across both decision branches.
The resulting conflict set can optionally be minimized using QuickXplain to
produce an IIS.

### [256] [Simulating Clinical AI Assistance using Multimodal LLMs: A Case Study in Diabetic Retinopathy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13234)
*Nadim Barakat,William Lotter*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该研究评估了多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在糖尿病视网膜病变检测中的表现，比较了GPT-4o和MedGemma两种模型，发现MedGemma在基线性能上更优，而GPT-4o在结合MedGemma描述性输出时能达到优异性能，表明MLLMs可改善DR筛查流程并作为临床AI辅助研究的可扩展模拟器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前FDA批准的糖尿病视网膜病变筛查系统主要提供二元转诊输出，这种最小化输出可能限制临床信任和实用性。确定最有效的输出格式以增强临床医生-AI性能是一个难以大规模评估的经验性挑战。

Method: 研究评估了两种多模态大语言模型（GPT-4o通用模型和MedGemma开源医疗模型）在IDRiD和Messidor-2数据集上的表现。实验包括：(1)基线评估，(2)使用合成预测模拟AI辅助，(3)实际的AI-to-AI协作，其中GPT-4o整合MedGemma输出。

Result: MedGemma在基线评估中表现优于GPT-4o，具有更高的敏感性和AUROC，而GPT-4o显示出近乎完美的特异性但敏感性较低。在AI协作中，GPT-4o在MedGemma描述性输出的指导下即使没有直接图像访问也能达到强结果（AUROC高达0.96）。

Conclusion: 多模态大语言模型可以改善糖尿病视网膜病变筛查流程，并作为研究不同输出配置下临床AI辅助的可扩展模拟器。开放式轻量级模型如MedGemma在资源有限环境中特别有价值，而描述性输出可以增强临床工作流程中的可解释性和临床医生信任。

Abstract: Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a leading cause of blindness worldwide, and AI
systems can expand access to fundus photography screening. Current FDA-cleared
systems primarily provide binary referral outputs, where this minimal output
may limit clinical trust and utility. Yet, determining the most effective
output format to enhance clinician-AI performance is an empirical challenge
that is difficult to assess at scale. We evaluated multimodal large language
models (MLLMs) for DR detection and their ability to simulate clinical AI
assistance across different output types. Two models were tested on IDRiD and
Messidor-2: GPT-4o, a general-purpose MLLM, and MedGemma, an open-source
medical model. Experiments included: (1) baseline evaluation, (2) simulated AI
assistance with synthetic predictions, and (3) actual AI-to-AI collaboration
where GPT-4o incorporated MedGemma outputs. MedGemma outperformed GPT-4o at
baseline, achieving higher sensitivity and AUROC, while GPT-4o showed
near-perfect specificity but low sensitivity. Both models adjusted predictions
based on simulated AI inputs, but GPT-4o's performance collapsed with incorrect
ones, whereas MedGemma remained more stable. In actual collaboration, GPT-4o
achieved strong results when guided by MedGemma's descriptive outputs, even
without direct image access (AUROC up to 0.96). These findings suggest MLLMs
may improve DR screening pipelines and serve as scalable simulators for
studying clinical AI assistance across varying output configurations. Open,
lightweight models such as MedGemma may be especially valuable in low-resource
settings, while descriptive outputs could enhance explainability and clinician
trust in clinical workflows.

TL;DR: 提出基于场景驱动的认知分层记忆架构(COLMA)，解决AI记忆系统适应性差、多模态整合不足等问题，为AGI发展提供结构化基础。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI向AGI发展，现有记忆系统存在适应性有限、多模态整合不足、无法支持持续学习等问题，需要更鲁棒和类人的记忆系统。

Method: 采用场景驱动方法，从代表性认知场景中提取关键功能需求，形成统一设计原则，构建认知分层记忆架构(COLMA)。

Result: 提出了COLMA框架，将认知场景、记忆过程和存储机制整合为统一设计，为AI系统提供结构化基础。

Conclusion: COLMA为开发具有终身学习和类人推理能力的AI系统提供了结构化基础，有助于AGI的实用化发展。

Abstract: As artificial intelligence advances toward artificial general intelligence
(AGI), the need for robust and human-like memory systems has become
increasingly evident. Current memory architectures often suffer from limited
adaptability, insufficient multimodal integration, and an inability to support
continuous learning. To address these limitations, we propose a scenario-driven
methodology that extracts essential functional requirements from representative
cognitive scenarios, leading to a unified set of design principles for
next-generation AI memory systems. Based on this approach, we introduce the
\textbf{COgnitive Layered Memory Architecture (COLMA)}, a novel framework that
integrates cognitive scenarios, memory processes, and storage mechanisms into a
cohesive design. COLMA provides a structured foundation for developing AI
systems capable of lifelong learning and human-like reasoning, thereby
contributing to the pragmatic development of AGI.

*Vincent Siu,Nathan W. Henry,Nicholas Crispino,Yang Liu,Dawn Song,Chenguang Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: RepIt是一个简单高效的概念表示分离框架，能够从少量数据中提取纯净的概念向量，实现对LLM行为的精准干预，在保持模型安全性的同时抑制特定概念的拒绝行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的激活引导方法往往产生比预期更广泛的影响，需要更纯净的概念向量来实现针对性干预，从而在更细粒度上理解LLM行为。

Method: 提出RepIt框架，通过数据高效的方式分离概念特定表示，仅需少量示例就能从100-200个神经元中提取稳健的目标表示。

Result: 在五个前沿LLM上验证，RepIt能够选择性抑制目标概念的拒绝行为，同时保持其他方面的拒绝能力，模型在回答WMD相关问题后仍能在标准基准测试中获得安全评分。

Conclusion: RepIt展示了针对性干预可以抵消过度泛化问题，为更精细的模型行为控制奠定了基础，但也引发了关于使用有限计算和数据就能进行操纵的双重担忧。

Abstract: While activation steering in large language models (LLMs) is a growing area
of research, methods can often incur broader effects than desired. This
motivates isolation of purer concept vectors to enable targeted interventions
and understand LLM behavior at a more granular level. We present RepIt, a
simple and data-efficient framework for isolating concept-specific
representations. Across five frontier LLMs, RepIt enables precise
interventions: it selectively suppresses refusal on targeted concepts while
preserving refusal elsewhere, producing models that answer WMD-related
questions while still scoring as safe on standard benchmarks. We further show
that the corrective signal localizes to just 100-200 neurons and that robust
target representations can be extracted from as few as a dozen examples on a
single A6000. This efficiency raises a dual concern: manipulations can be
performed with modest compute and data to extend to underrepresented
data-scarce topics while evading existing benchmarks. By disentangling refusal
vectors with RepIt, this work demonstrates that targeted interventions can
counteract overgeneralization, laying the foundation for more granular control
of model behavior.

### [259] [Shapes of Cognition for Computational Cognitive Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13288)
*Marjorie McShane,Sergei Nirenburg,Sanjay Oruganti,Jesse English*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: Shapes of cognition是一种新的计算认知建模范式，通过记忆化的知识星座来简化复杂现实，让智能体像人类一样通过模式识别、习惯行动和类比推理来最小化认知负荷。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决语言赋能智能体(LEIAs)在复杂现实环境中的认知建模问题，提出一种能够模拟人类认知简化机制的新范式，使智能体能够像人类一样通过典型性预期和模式识别来处理复杂情境。

Method: 基于形状的建模方法，使用记忆化的感官、语言、概念、情景和程序知识星座，采用基于形状的恢复方法处理非典型结果，包括即时学习、寻求人类帮助或获取可操作的情境理解。

Result: 开发了一个具体的认知架构实现，能够对广泛现象进行建模，实现了可解释、可扩展且值得信赖的智能体系统，即使在关键领域也能适用。

Conclusion: 形状认知范式不仅为LEIAs提供了具体的建模方法，其原则还可以更广泛地应用于知识型和混合AI领域，为这些领域注入新的活力。

Abstract: Shapes of cognition is a new conceptual paradigm for the computational
cognitive modeling of Language-Endowed Intelligent Agents (LEIAs). Shapes are
remembered constellations of sensory, linguistic, conceptual, episodic, and
procedural knowledge that allow agents to cut through the complexity of real
life the same way as people do: by expecting things to be typical, recognizing
patterns, acting by habit, reasoning by analogy, satisficing, and generally
minimizing cognitive load to the degree situations permit. Atypical outcomes
are treated using shapes-based recovery methods, such as learning on the fly,
asking a human partner for help, or seeking an actionable, even if imperfect,
situational understanding. Although shapes is an umbrella term, it is not
vague: shapes-based modeling involves particular objectives, hypotheses,
modeling strategies, knowledge bases, and actual models of wide-ranging
phenomena, all implemented within a particular cognitive architecture. Such
specificity is needed both to vet our hypotheses and to achieve our practical
aims of building useful agent systems that are explainable, extensible, and
worthy of our trust, even in critical domains. However, although the LEIA
example of shapes-based modeling is specific, the principles can be applied
more broadly, giving new life to knowledge-based and hybrid AI.

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: LLMs对数据科学教育产生重大影响，42名教师的访谈显示58%已开始将LLMs融入教学，但31%仍不愿使用，教育界呈现谨慎乐观的态度


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLMs普及化对数据科学教育带来的根本性挑战，了解教育工作者如何适应这一技术变革

Method: 对42名来自33所院校的教师进行半结构化访谈，进行定性分析

Result: 58%的教师已在课程中引入LLMs演示和指导活动，31%的教师尚未使用且无计划使用，教育界呈现混合态度

Conclusion: 需要开发AI感知的评估方法、反思性使用LLMs作为辅导工具，以及课程专用聊天机器人，确保课程与技术进步保持同步

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shifted in just a few years from novelty to
ubiquity, raising fundamental questions for data science education. Tasks once
used to teach coding, writing, and problem-solving can now be completed by
LLMs, forcing educators to reconsider both pedagogy and assessment. To
understand how instructors are adapting, we conducted semi-structured
interviews with 42 instructors from 33 institutions in 10 countries in June and
July 2025. Our qualitative analysis reveals a pragmatic mix of optimism and
concern. Many respondents view LLMs as inevitable classroom tools -- comparable
to calculators or Wikipedia -- while others worry about de-skilling, misplaced
confidence, and uneven integration across institutions. Around 58 per cent have
already introduced demonstrations, guided activities, or make extensive use of
LLMs in their courses, though most expect change to remain slow and uneven.
That said, 31 per cent have not used LLMs to teach students and do not plan to.
We highlight some instructional innovations, including AI-aware assessments,
reflective use of LLMs as tutors, and course-specific chatbots. By sharing
these perspectives, we aim to help data science educators adapt collectively to
ensure curricula keep pace with technological change.

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 提出了Prompt Commons——一个版本化、社区维护的提示词库，通过治理元数据、许可和审核机制来引导LLM行为趋向多元化，在城市治理中提高中立性并减少有害输出。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM在城市治理中的应用对带有价值判断的提示词高度敏感，需要一种机制来引导模型行为符合多元价值观和本地治理需求。

Method: 建立版本化社区维护的提示词库，包含治理元数据、许可和审核功能；在蒙特利尔数据集上测试三种治理状态（开放、策展、否决启用）；采用CC BY/BY-SA许可和OpenRAIL式限制。

Result: 单一作者提示词产生24%中性结果，公共治理提示词将中性结果提升至48-52%；否决启用机制将有害输出的修复时间从30.5±8.9小时减少到5.6±1.5小时。

Conclusion: 提示词治理为城市提供了一种实用机制，使AI与本地价值观和问责制保持一致，通过社区维护的提示词库可以实现更好的多元化和安全性。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are entering urban governance, yet their outputs
are highly sensitive to prompts that carry value judgments. We propose Prompt
Commons - a versioned, community-maintained repository of prompts with
governance metadata, licensing, and moderation - to steer model behaviour
toward pluralism. Using a Montreal dataset (443 human prompts; 3,317 after
augmentation), we pilot three governance states (open, curated, veto-enabled).
On a contested policy benchmark, a single-author prompt yields 24 percent
neutral outcomes; commons-governed prompts raise neutrality to 48-52 percent
while retaining decisiveness where appropriate. In a synthetic incident log, a
veto-enabled regime reduces time-to-remediation for harmful outputs from 30.5
+/- 8.9 hours (open) to 5.6 +/- 1.5 hours. We outline licensing (CC BY/BY-SA
for prompts with optional OpenRAIL-style restrictions for artefacts), auditable
moderation, and safeguards against dominance capture. Prompt governance offers
a practical lever for cities to align AI with local values and accountability.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索AI4SG（人工智能促进社会公益）项目在解决公共卫生等社会问题时的实际效益，重点关注资助议程如何影响项目方向和社区参与度。

Method: 采用定性分析方法，研究了35份资助文件，这些文件代表了总计约4.1亿美元的投资，分析资助议程对AI4SG项目方法的影响。

Result: 研究发现AI4SG项目宣称的社会效益意图与实际采用的技术中心主义方法之间存在明显脱节，资助议程倾向于技术导向而非社区参与导向。

Conclusion: 建议资助者在未来资助设计中平衡情境理解和技术能力，呼吁AI4SG资助者与HCI社区加强合作，在资助项目设计过程中更好地支持社区参与工作。

Abstract: Artificial Intelligence for Social Good (AI4SG) is a growing area exploring
AI's potential to address social issues like public health. Yet prior work has
shown limited evidence of its tangible benefits for intended communities, and
projects frequently face inadequate community engagement and sustainability
challenges. Funding agendas play a crucial role in framing AI4SG initiatives
and shaping their approaches. Through a qualitative analysis of 35 funding
documents -- representing about $410 million USD in total investments, we
reveal dissonances between AI4SG's stated intentions for positive social impact
and the techno-centric approaches that some funding agendas promoted. Drawing
on our findings, we offer recommendations for funders to scaffold approaches
that balance both contextual understanding and technical capacities in future
funding call designs. We call for greater engagement between AI4SG funders and
the HCI community to support community engagement work in the funding program
design process.

Motivation: 随着人工智能和计算技术的快速发展，这些技术正在重塑社会科学研究，特别是对深度定性方法提出了新的挑战和机遇。论文旨在重新审视经典辩论，评估自动化、AI聊天机器人和大数据时代下的可能性和危险。

Method: 论文首先历史化发展，回顾了使用计算机分析定性数据的经典和新兴关切。然后提出了当代参与模式的类型学：简化工作流程、扩大项目规模、混合分析方法、计算社会学，以及拒绝计算分析。通过大规模民族志研究的详细工作流程示例和独立研究者指南来说明这些方法。

Result: 论文展示了计算工具如何在保持核心方法论承诺的前提下，通过精心设计和适应来支持传统的定性研究目标，同时认识到这些工具既具有危险性又具有生成性。

Conclusion: 主张采用超越技术乐观主义与拒绝二元对立的实用主义社会学方法，强调计算工具在谨慎使用和与定性研究方法论承诺相一致的情况下，可以成为支持社会科学研究的有效手段。

Abstract: Rapid computational developments - particularly the proliferation of
artificial intelligence (AI) - increasingly shape social scientific research
while raising new questions about in-depth qualitative methods such as
ethnography and interviewing. Building on classic debates about using computers
to analyze qualitative data, we revisit longstanding concerns and assess
possibilities and dangers in an era of automation, AI chatbots, and 'big data.'
We first historicize developments by revisiting classical and emergent concerns
about qualitative analysis with computers. We then introduce a typology of
contemporary modes of engagement - streamlining workflows, scaling up projects,
hybrid analytical approaches, and the sociology of computation - alongside
rejection of computational analyses. We illustrate these approaches with
detailed workflow examples from a large-scale ethnographic study and guidance
for solo researchers. We argue for a pragmatic sociological approach that moves
beyond dualisms of technological optimism versus rejection to show how
computational tools - simultaneously dangerous and generative - can be adapted
to support longstanding qualitative aims when used carefully in ways aligned
with core methodological commitments.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在政治极化和社会分裂加剧的背景下，代表性审议大会成为解决复杂政策问题的重要民主论坛，但缺乏系统追踪观点如何演变成具体政策建议的实证研究方法。

Method: 开发基于大语言模型(LLM)的方法论，分析技术增强的面对面审议大会转录文本，识别和可视化表达建议的空间，并重构每位代表在整个会议期间的立场演变。

Result: 该方法能够揭示传统大会输出中不可见的高分辨率动态，提供了对审议过程的新实证见解，展示了LLM在分析民主审议中的潜力。

Conclusion: LLM为基础的方法为系统分析审议过程中的观点演变和代表立场变化提供了有效工具，有助于更好地理解民主审议的动态机制。

Abstract: In an era of increasing societal fragmentation, political polarization, and
erosion of public trust in institutions, representative deliberative assemblies
are emerging as a promising democratic forum for developing effective policy
outcomes on complex global issues. Despite theoretical attention, there remains
limited empirical work that systematically traces how specific ideas evolve,
are prioritized, or are discarded during deliberation to form policy
recommendations. Addressing these gaps, this work poses two central questions:
(1) How might we trace the evolution and distillation of ideas into concrete
recommendations within deliberative assemblies? (2) How does the deliberative
process shape delegate perspectives and influence voting dynamics over the
course of the assembly? To address these questions, we develop LLM-based
methodologies for empirically analyzing transcripts from a tech-enhanced
in-person deliberative assembly. The framework identifies and visualizes the
space of expressed suggestions. We also empirically reconstruct each delegate's
evolving perspective throughout the assembly. Our methods contribute novel
empirical insights into deliberative processes and demonstrate how LLMs can
surface high-resolution dynamics otherwise invisible in traditional assembly
outputs.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CanLII限制了加拿大法律数据的批量和程序化访问，导致资源充足的机构拥有先进技术工具，而公众只能使用二流工具，造成了数字鸿沟，阻碍了法律免费获取和司法公正运动。

Method: 创建A2AJ加拿大法律数据项目，提供超过116,000个法院判决和5,000项法规的开放访问，支持多种渠道包括API、机器学习数据集和AI集成协议。

Result: 项目成功提供了大规模的法律数据开放访问，使法院能够进行基于证据的评估，并允许开发者为服务低收入社区的从业者创建工具。

Conclusion: 开放法律数据对于实现司法公正和缩小数字鸿沟至关重要，A2AJ项目展示了如何通过技术手段促进法律数据的民主化访问和应用。

Abstract: The Access to Algorithmic Justice project (A2AJ) is an open-source
alternative to the Canadian Legal Information Institute (CanLII). At a moment
when technology promises to enable new ways of working with law, CanLII is
becoming an impediment to the free access of law and access to justice
movements because it restricts bulk and programmatic access to Canadian legal
data. This means that Canada is staring down a digital divide: well-resourced
actors have the best new technological tools and, because CanLII has disclaimed
leadership, the public only gets second-rate tools. This article puts CanLII in
its larger historical context and shows how long and deep efforts to
democratize access to Canadian legal data are, and how often they are thwarted
by private industry. We introduce the A2AJ's Canadian Legal Data project, which
provides open access to over 116,000 court decisions and 5,000 statutes through
multiple channels including APIs, machine learning datasets, and AI integration
protocols. Through concrete examples, we demonstrate how open legal data
enables courts to conduct evidence-based assessments and allows developers to
create tools for practitioners serving low-income communities.

TL;DR: 提出混合合作组织（HC）架构，通过智能合约协调和最小化法律接口，实现选择性去中心化治理，解决区块链项目在碎片化多利益相关方生态系统中的协调问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 区块链虽被宣传为碎片化多利益相关方生态系统的协调解决方案，但许多项目停留在试点阶段，需要解决可扩展的多利益相关方协调问题

Method: 采用设计科学方法开发混合合作组织（HC）架构，结合智能合约协调与最小化代码遵从法律接口及司法管辖区模块，实现选择性去中心化

Result: 通过对两个供应链追溯项目的案例评估，显示HC改善了分布式任务管理、可验证信息、激励一致性、制度互操作性和可扩展、可争议治理

Conclusion: 为信息系统领域贡献了一个跨监管和组织边界的可扩展多利益相关方协调的社会技术模型

Abstract: Blockchain has been promoted as a remedy for coordination in fragmented,
multi-stakeholder ecosystems, yet many projects stall at pilot stage. Using a
design-science approach, we develop the Hybrid Cooperative (HC), a digitally
native governance architecture that combines smart-contract coordination with a
minimal, code-deferent legal interface and jurisdictional modules. This
selective decentralization decentralizes rules where programmability lowers
agency and verification costs, and centralizes only what is needed for
enforceability. A post-case evaluation against two traceability initiatives in
supply chains illustrates how the HC improves distributed task management,
verifiable information, incentive alignment, institutional interoperability,
and scalable, contestable governance. The paper contributes to Information
Systems by specifying a socio-technical model for scalable, multi-stakeholder
coordination across regulatory and organizational boundaries.

Motivation: 研究大语言模型作为数字基础设施的经济属性，理解其公共产品特性，为政策制定提供理论基础，以优化社会福利和促进公平发展。

Method: 开发数学模型量化LLMs的非竞争性、部分排他性和正外部性特征，通过比较分析开源和闭源发展路径，实证研究不同领域的溢出效应和网络外部性。

Result: 识别了开源和闭源LLMs在资源配置效率、创新轨迹和访问公平性方面的系统性差异，评估了LLMs在知识传播、创新加速和产业转型方面的外部性影响。

Conclusion: 提出了平衡创新激励与公平访问的政策建议，包括公私合作机制、计算资源民主化和优化社会福利的治理结构，为理解基础AI模型的经济本质和发展政策提供了指导。

Abstract: This paper conceptualizes Large Language Models (LLMs) as a form of mixed
public goods within digital infrastructure, analyzing their economic properties
through a comprehensive theoretical framework. We develop mathematical models
to quantify the non-rivalry characteristics, partial excludability, and
positive externalities of LLMs. Through comparative analysis of open-source and
closed-source development paths, we identify systematic differences in resource
allocation efficiency, innovation trajectories, and access equity. Our
empirical research evaluates the spillover effects and network externalities of
LLMs across different domains, including knowledge diffusion, innovation
acceleration, and industry transformation. Based on these findings, we propose
policy recommendations for balancing innovation incentives with equitable
access, including public-private partnership mechanisms, computational resource
democratization, and governance structures that optimize social welfare. This
interdisciplinary approach contributes to understanding the economic nature of
foundation AI models and provides policy guidance for their development as
critical digital infrastructure
