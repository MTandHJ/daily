Abstract: Addressing plant diseases and pests is critical for enhancing crop production
and preventing economic losses. Recent advances in artificial intelligence
(AI), machine learning (ML), and deep learning (DL) have significantly improved
the precision and efficiency of detection methods, surpassing the limitations
of manual identification. This study reviews modern computer-based techniques
for detecting plant diseases and pests from images, including recent AI
developments. The methodologies are organized into five categories:
hyperspectral imaging, non-visualization techniques, visualization approaches,
modified deep learning architectures, and transformer models. This structured
taxonomy provides researchers with detailed, actionable insights for selecting
advanced state-of-the-art detection methods. A comprehensive survey of recent
work and comparative studies demonstrates the consistent superiority of modern
AI-based approaches, which often outperform older image analysis methods in
speed and accuracy. In particular, vision transformers such as the Hierarchical
Vision Transformer (HvT) have shown accuracy exceeding 99.3% in plant disease
detection, outperforming architectures like MobileNetV3. The study concludes by
discussing system design challenges, proposing solutions, and outlining
promising directions for future research.

### [2] [ImageDDI: Image-enhanced Molecular Motif Sequence Representation for Drug-Drug Interaction Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08338)
*Yuqin He,Tengfei Ma,Chaoyi Li,Pengsen Ma,Hongxin Xiang,Jianmin Wang,Yiping Liu,Bosheng Song,Xiangxiang Zeng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ImageDDI框架通过结合分子功能基序序列和全局分子图像信息，提升药物相互作用预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在药物相互作用预测中受限于功能基序表示学习不足，而DDIs主要由基序相互作用引起。

Method: ImageDDI将分子分解为功能基序，通过Transformer编码器嵌入序列，并结合分子图像信息（如纹理、颜色等）增强空间表示。

Result: 实验表明ImageDDI优于现有方法，并在2D和3D图像增强场景中表现优异。

Conclusion: ImageDDI通过融合功能基序和分子图像信息，显著提升了DDI预测的准确性和泛化能力。

Abstract: To mitigate the potential adverse health effects of simultaneous multi-drug
use, including unexpected side effects and interactions, accurately identifying
and predicting drug-drug interactions (DDIs) is considered a crucial task in
the field of deep learning. Although existing methods have demonstrated
promising performance, they suffer from the bottleneck of limited functional
motif-based representation learning, as DDIs are fundamentally caused by motif
interactions rather than the overall drug structures. In this paper, we propose
an Image-enhanced molecular motif sequence representation framework for
\textbf{DDI} prediction, called ImageDDI, which represents a pair of drugs from
both global and local structures. Specifically, ImageDDI tokenizes molecules
into functional motifs. To effectively represent a drug pair, their motifs are
combined into a single sequence and embedded using a transformer-based encoder,
starting from the local structure representation. By leveraging the
associations between drug pairs, ImageDDI further enhances the spatial
representation of molecules using global molecular image information (e.g.
texture, shadow, color, and planar spatial relationships). To integrate
molecular visual information into functional motif sequence, ImageDDI employs
Adaptive Feature Fusion, enhancing the generalization of ImageDDI by
dynamically adapting the fusion process of feature representations.
Experimental results on widely used datasets demonstrate that ImageDDI
outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, extensive experiments show that
ImageDDI achieved competitive performance in both 2D and 3D image-enhanced
scenarios compared to other models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 物联网设备数量激增，但资源受限的微控制器难以支持深度学习目标检测模型的计算需求，需要优化技术以实现高效边缘计算。

Method: 论文详细分析了量化、剪枝、知识蒸馏和神经架构搜索等优化技术，并结合理论与实际实现。

Abstract: Object detection (OD) has become vital for numerous computer vision
applications, but deploying it on resource-constrained IoT devices presents a
significant challenge. These devices, often powered by energy-efficient
microcontrollers, struggle to handle the computational load of deep
learning-based OD models. This issue is compounded by the rapid proliferation
of IoT devices, predicted to surpass 150 billion by 2030. TinyML offers a
compelling solution by enabling OD on ultra-low-power devices, paving the way
for efficient and real-time processing at the edge. Although numerous survey
papers have been published on this topic, they often overlook the optimization
challenges associated with deploying OD models in TinyML environments. To
address this gap, this survey paper provides a detailed analysis of key
optimization techniques for deploying OD models on resource-constrained
devices. These techniques include quantization, pruning, knowledge
distillation, and neural architecture search. Furthermore, we explore both
theoretical approaches and practical implementations, bridging the gap between
academic research and real-world edge artificial intelligence deployment.
Finally, we compare the key performance indicators (KPIs) of existing OD
implementations on microcontroller devices, highlighting the achieved maturity
level of these solutions in terms of both prediction accuracy and efficiency.
We also provide a public repository to continually track developments in this
fast-evolving field:

### [4] [Neural Tangent Knowledge Distillation for Optical Convolutional Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08421)
*Jinlin Xiang,Minho Choi,Yubo Zhang,Zhihao Zhou,Arka Majumdar,Eli Shlizerman*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种任务无关和硬件无关的混合光学神经网络（ONN）优化管道，通过神经切线知识蒸馏（NTKD）缩小精度差距，并在多种数据集和硬件配置上验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 混合光学神经网络（ONN）因其能效优势适用于实时、功耗受限系统，但面临训练精度差距和仿真与实物系统差异的挑战。

Method: 提出任务无关和硬件无关的优化管道，包括预训练精度估计和NTKD方法，用于训练和实物系统微调。

Result: 在MNIST、CIFAR等数据集和多种硬件配置上，管道显著提升ONN性能，支持实际部署。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了ONN的精度和泛化问题，为实际应用提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Hybrid Optical Neural Networks (ONNs, typically consisting of an optical
frontend and a digital backend) offer an energy-efficient alternative to fully
digital deep networks for real-time, power-constrained systems. However, their
adoption is limited by two main challenges: the accuracy gap compared to
large-scale networks during training, and discrepancies between simulated and
fabricated systems that further degrade accuracy. While previous work has
proposed end-to-end optimizations for specific datasets (e.g., MNIST) and
optical systems, these approaches typically lack generalization across tasks
and hardware designs. To address these limitations, we propose a task-agnostic
and hardware-agnostic pipeline that supports image classification and
segmentation across diverse optical systems. To assist optical system design
before training, we estimate achievable model accuracy based on user-specified
constraints such as physical size and the dataset. For training, we introduce
Neural Tangent Knowledge Distillation (NTKD), which aligns optical models with
electronic teacher networks, thereby narrowing the accuracy gap. After
fabrication, NTKD also guides fine-tuning of the digital backend to compensate
for implementation errors. Experiments on multiple datasets (e.g., MNIST,
CIFAR, Carvana Masking) and hardware configurations show that our pipeline
consistently improves ONN performance and enables practical deployment in both
pre-fabrication simulations and physical implementations.

### [5] [MAViS: A Multi-Agent Framework for Long-Sequence Video Storytelling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08487)
*Qian Wang,Ziqi Huang,Ruoxi Jia,Paul Debevec,Ning Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MAViS是一个多智能体协作框架，用于生成长序列视频叙事，通过分阶段协作和3E原则优化生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有长序列视频生成框架存在辅助能力差、视觉质量不佳和表现力有限的问题。

Method: MAViS通过多阶段智能体协作（如脚本编写、镜头设计等）和3E原则（探索、检查、增强）实现视频生成。

Result: 实验表明，MAViS在辅助能力、视觉质量和表现力上达到领先水平，并能生成多模态设计输出。

Conclusion: MAViS是目前唯一支持多模态设计输出的框架，显著提升了长序列视频生成的质量和创造力。

Abstract: Despite recent advances, long-sequence video generation frameworks still
suffer from significant limitations: poor assistive capability, suboptimal
visual quality, and limited expressiveness. To mitigate these limitations, we
propose MAViS, an end-to-end multi-agent collaborative framework for
long-sequence video storytelling. MAViS orchestrates specialized agents across
multiple stages, including script writing, shot designing, character modeling,
keyframe generation, video animation, and audio generation. In each stage,
agents operate under the 3E Principle -- Explore, Examine, and Enhance -- to
ensure the completeness of intermediate outputs. Considering the capability
limitations of current generative models, we propose the Script Writing
Guidelines to optimize compatibility between scripts and generative tools.
Experimental results demonstrate that MAViS achieves state-of-the-art
performance in assistive capability, visual quality, and video expressiveness.
Its modular framework further enables scalability with diverse generative
models and tools. With just a brief user prompt, MAViS is capable of producing
high-quality, expressive long-sequence video storytelling, enriching
inspirations and creativity for users. To the best of our knowledge, MAViS is
the only framework that provides multimodal design output -- videos with
narratives and background music.

### [6] [MuGa-VTON: Multi-Garment Virtual Try-On via Diffusion Transformers with Prompt Customization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08488)
*Ankan Deria,Dwarikanath Mahapatra,Behzad Bozorgtabar,Mohna Chakraborty,Snehashis Chakraborty,Sudipta Roy*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MuGa-VTON是一个统一的多服装扩散框架，通过联合建模上下服装和个人身份，解决了现有虚拟试衣方法在保留身份和服装保真度上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有虚拟试衣方法通常分开处理上下服装，依赖繁重的预处理，且难以保留个人特征（如纹身、配饰和体型），导致真实感和灵活性受限。

Method: MuGa-VTON提出三个关键模块：GRM（服装表示模块）捕捉服装语义，PRM（个人表示模块）编码身份和姿势线索，A-DiT融合模块通过扩散变压器整合服装、个人和文本提示特征。

Result: 在VITON-HD和DressCode基准测试中，MuGa-VTON在定性和定量评估上均优于现有方法，生成高保真且保留身份的结果。

Conclusion: MuGa-VTON为虚拟试衣提供了更真实、灵活的解决方案，适用于实际应用。

Abstract: Virtual try-on seeks to generate photorealistic images of individuals in
desired garments, a task that must simultaneously preserve personal identity
and garment fidelity for practical use in fashion retail and personalization.
However, existing methods typically handle upper and lower garments separately,
rely on heavy preprocessing, and often fail to preserve person-specific cues
such as tattoos, accessories, and body shape-resulting in limited realism and
flexibility. To this end, we introduce MuGa-VTON, a unified multi-garment
diffusion framework that jointly models upper and lower garments together with
person identity in a shared latent space. Specifically, we proposed three key
modules: the Garment Representation Module (GRM) for capturing both garment
semantics, the Person Representation Module (PRM) for encoding identity and
pose cues, and the A-DiT fusion module, which integrates garment, person, and
text-prompt features through a diffusion transformer. This architecture
supports prompt-based customization, allowing fine-grained garment
modifications with minimal user input. Extensive experiments on the VITON-HD
and DressCode benchmarks demonstrate that MuGa-VTON outperforms existing
methods in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations, producing
high-fidelity, identity-preserving results suitable for real-world virtual
try-on applications.

### [7] [CObL: Toward Zero-Shot Ordinal Layering without User Prompting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08498)
*Aneel Damaraju,Dean Hazineh,Todd Zickler*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为CObL的扩散架构，用于从图像中推断出由遮挡顺序排列的物体层组成的场景表示。CObL能够并行生成物体层，并利用Stable Diffusion作为自然物体的先验，确保推断出的层能够复合成输入图像。该方法在合成图像上训练，并能零样本泛化到真实世界图像。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉任务需要将像素分组为物体并理解其空间关系（包括遮挡关系）。现有的方法在无监督物体表示学习和遮挡物体完成方面存在局限性。

Method: CObL是一种扩散模型，通过并行生成物体层，利用Stable Diffusion作为先验，并通过推理时指导确保层复合成输入图像。训练数据为合成的多物体桌面场景图像。

Result: CObL在合成图像上训练后，能够零样本泛化到真实世界的桌面照片，且无需用户提示或预先知道物体数量。

Conclusion: CObL在无监督物体表示学习和遮挡物体完成方面表现出色，优于现有方法，且具有更强的泛化能力。

Abstract: Vision benefits from grouping pixels into objects and understanding their
spatial relationships, both laterally and in depth. We capture this with a
scene representation comprising an occlusion-ordered stack of "object layers,"
each containing an isolated and amodally-completed object. To infer this
representation from an image, we introduce a diffusion-based architecture named
Concurrent Object Layers (CObL). CObL generates a stack of object layers in
parallel, using Stable Diffusion as a prior for natural objects and
inference-time guidance to ensure the inferred layers composite back to the
input image. We train CObL using a few thousand synthetically-generated images
of multi-object tabletop scenes, and we find that it zero-shot generalizes to
photographs of real-world tabletops with varying numbers of novel objects. In
contrast to recent models for amodal object completion, CObL reconstructs
multiple occluded objects without user prompting and without knowing the number
of objects beforehand. Unlike previous models for unsupervised object-centric
representation learning, CObL is not limited to the world it was trained in.

*Aaditya Baranwal,Madhav Kataria,Naitik Agrawal,Yogesh S Rawat,Shruti Vyas*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 当前视觉语言模型（VLMs）在序列视觉叙事处理中存在表面识别与深度叙事推理的显著差距，尤其在漫画叙事理解中表现不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 揭示现有大型多模态模型在个体面板解释上的优势，但在时间因果关系和跨面板连贯性上的系统性失败，这是故事理解的核心需求。

Method: 提出新的评估框架，结合细粒度多模态标注、跨模态嵌入分析和检索增强评估，系统性地描述这些局限性。

Result: 在《Re:Zero》漫画的308个标注面板上测试，发现当前模型缺乏真正的故事级智能，尤其在非线性叙事、角色一致性和因果推理方面表现不佳。

Conclusion: 为评估叙事智能提供了基础和方法论，同时为多模态模型在离散视觉叙事中的深度序列理解能力提供了实用见解。

Abstract: Current Vision Language Models (VLMs) demonstrate a critical gap between
surface-level recognition and deep narrative reasoning when processing
sequential visual storytelling. Through a comprehensive investigation of manga
narrative understanding, we reveal that while recent large multimodal models
excel at individual panel interpretation, they systematically fail at temporal
causality and cross-panel cohesion, core requirements for coherent story
comprehension. We introduce a novel evaluation framework that combines
fine-grained multimodal annotation, cross-modal embedding analysis, and
retrieval-augmented assessment to systematically characterize these
limitations.
  Our methodology includes (i) a rigorous annotation protocol linking visual
elements to narrative structure through aligned light novel text, (ii)
comprehensive evaluation across multiple reasoning paradigms, including direct
inference and retrieval-augmented generation, and (iii) cross-modal similarity
analysis revealing fundamental misalignments in current VLMs' joint
representations. Applying this framework to Re:Zero manga across 11 chapters
with 308 annotated panels, we conduct the first systematic study of long-form
narrative understanding in VLMs through three core evaluation axes: generative
storytelling, contextual dialogue grounding, and temporal reasoning. Our
findings demonstrate that current models lack genuine story-level intelligence,
struggling particularly with non-linear narratives, character consistency, and
causal inference across extended sequences. This work establishes both the
foundation and practical methodology for evaluating narrative intelligence,
while providing actionable insights into the capability of deep sequential
understanding of Discrete Visual Narratives beyond basic recognition in
Multimodal Models.

### [9] [VISOR: Visual Input-based Steering for Output Redirection in Vision-Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08521)
*Mansi Phute,Ravikumar Balakrishnan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VISOR是一种通过优化视觉输入实现行为控制的新方法，无需修改模型内部，适用于所有VLM服务模式，且在安全性和隐蔽性上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VLM行为控制方法（如系统提示或激活向量）存在易检测、侵入性强或兼容性差的问题，需要一种更高效且隐蔽的解决方案。

Method: VISOR通过设计通用的视觉引导图像，诱导目标激活模式，实现行为控制，无需运行时访问模型内部。

Result: 在LLaVA-1.5-7B上验证，VISOR在拒绝、奉承和生存本能任务中表现优异，单张150KB图像即可实现显著行为偏移（高达25%），且不影响其他任务性能。

Conclusion: VISOR重新定义了多模态模型控制方式，揭示了视觉引导攻击的安全漏洞，呼吁开发针对此类攻击的防御措施。

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) are increasingly being used in a broad range of
applications, bringing their security and behavioral control to the forefront.
While existing approaches for behavioral control or output redirection, like
system prompting in VLMs, are easily detectable and often ineffective,
activation-based steering vectors require invasive runtime access to model
internals--incompatible with API-based services and closed-source deployments.
We introduce VISOR (Visual Input-based Steering for Output Redirection), a
novel method that achieves sophisticated behavioral control through optimized
visual inputs alone. By crafting universal steering images that induce target
activation patterns, VISOR enables practical deployment across all VLM serving
modalities while remaining imperceptible compared to explicit textual
instructions. We validate VISOR on LLaVA-1.5-7B across three critical alignment
tasks: refusal, sycophancy and survival instinct. A single 150KB steering image
matches steering vector performance within 1-2% for positive behavioral shifts
while dramatically exceeding it for negative steering--achieving up to 25%
shifts from baseline compared to steering vectors' modest changes. Unlike
system prompting (3-4% shifts), VISOR provides robust bidirectional control
while maintaining 99.9% performance on 14,000 unrelated MMLU tasks. Beyond
eliminating runtime overhead and model access requirements, VISOR exposes a
critical security vulnerability: adversaries can achieve sophisticated
behavioral manipulation through visual channels alone, bypassing text-based
defenses. Our work fundamentally re-imagines multimodal model control and
highlights the urgent need for defenses against visual steering attacks.

### [10] [Training Kindai OCR with parallel textline images and self-attention feature distance-based loss](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08537)
*Anh Le,Asanobu Kitamoto*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 研究利用平行文本行图像（近代日语原文与现代日语字体对照）扩充OCR训练数据，提出基于距离的目标函数以减少特征差异，实验显示字符错误率显著降低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 近代日语文献转录耗时且标注数据稀缺，限制了OCR系统的训练效果。

Method: 引入平行文本行图像对，设计基于欧氏距离和最大均值差异（MMD）的目标函数，优化自注意力特征。

Result: 字符错误率分别降低2.23%（欧氏距离）和3.94%（MMD），自注意力表征质量提升。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升历史文献OCR性能，解决了数据稀缺问题。

Abstract: Kindai documents, written in modern Japanese from the late 19th to early 20th
century, hold significant historical value for researchers studying societal
structures, daily life, and environmental conditions of that period. However,
transcribing these documents remains a labor-intensive and time-consuming task,
resulting in limited annotated data for training optical character recognition
(OCR) systems. This research addresses this challenge of data scarcity by
leveraging parallel textline images - pairs of original Kindai text and their
counterparts in contemporary Japanese fonts - to augment training datasets. We
introduce a distance-based objective function that minimizes the gap between
self-attention features of the parallel image pairs. Specifically, we explore
Euclidean distance and Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) as domain adaptation
metrics. Experimental results demonstrate that our method reduces the character
error rate (CER) by 2.23% and 3.94% over a Transformer-based OCR baseline when
using Euclidean distance and MMD, respectively. Furthermore, our approach
improves the discriminative quality of self-attention representations, leading
to more effective OCR performance for historical documents.

*Wenhao Liang,Wei Emma Zhang,Lin Yue,Miao Xu,Olaf Maennel,Weitong Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CalAttn是一种用于Vision Transformers的校准模块，通过学习每个实例的自适应温度，显著降低校准误差，同时几乎不增加参数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在风险敏感应用中，Vision Transformers的概率校准至关重要，而传统的全局温度缩放方法存在局限性。

Method: 提出Calibration Attention (CalAttn)，直接从ViT的CLS令牌学习每个实例的自适应温度。

Result: 在多个数据集上，CalAttn将校准误差降低至多4倍，且参数增加不到0.1%。

Conclusion: CalAttn简单高效，无需牺牲准确性即可提供更可信的概率。

Abstract: Probability calibration is critical when Vision Transformers are deployed in
risk-sensitive applications. The standard fix, post-hoc temperature scaling,
uses a single global scalar and requires a held-out validation set. We
introduce Calibration Attention (CalAttn), a drop-in module that learns an
adaptive, per-instance temperature directly from the ViT's CLS token. Across
CIFAR-10/100, MNIST, Tiny-ImageNet, and ImageNet-1K, CalAttn reduces
calibration error by up to 4x on ViT-224, DeiT, and Swin, while adding under
0.1 percent additional parameters. The learned temperatures cluster tightly
around 1.0, in contrast to the large global values used by standard temperature
scaling. CalAttn is simple, efficient, and architecture-agnostic, and yields
more trustworthy probabilities without sacrificing accuracy. Code:

*Wei Li,Pengcheng Zhou,Linye Ma,Wenyi Zhao,Huihua Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种通用的框架DTLP-Net，用于解决医学图像分割中的半监督学习、领域泛化和领域适应问题，通过多样化的教师模型和标签传播提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像分割中标注数据有限和领域偏移是常见挑战，现有方法通常针对单一任务且性能受限，因此需要一种通用框架来解决这些问题。

Method: 采用DTLP-Net框架，包含一个学生模型和两个多样化的教师模型，结合数据增强和标签传播技术，生成可靠的伪标签并提升模型多样性。

Result: 在五个基准数据集上的实验表明，该方法在半监督学习、领域泛化和领域适应任务中均显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DTLP-Net框架具有通用性和高效性，能够应对更具挑战性的半监督学习场景。

Abstract: Both limited annotation and domain shift are significant challenges
frequently encountered in medical image segmentation, leading to derivative
scenarios like semi-supervised medical (SSMIS), semi-supervised medical domain
generalization (Semi-MDG) and unsupervised medical domain adaptation (UMDA).
Conventional methods are generally tailored to specific tasks in isolation, the
error accumulation hinders the effective utilization of unlabeled data and
limits further improvements, resulting in suboptimal performance when these
issues occur. In this paper, we aim to develop a generic framework that masters
all three tasks. We found that the key to solving the problem lies in how to
generate reliable pseudo labels for the unlabeled data in the presence of
domain shift with labeled data and increasing the diversity of the model. To
tackle this issue, we employ a Diverse Teaching and Label Propagation Network
(DTLP-Net) to boosting the Generic Semi-Supervised Medical Image Segmentation.
Our DTLP-Net involves a single student model and two diverse teacher models,
which can generate reliable pseudo-labels for the student model. The first
teacher model decouple the training process with labeled and unlabeled data,
The second teacher is momentum-updated periodically, thus generating reliable
yet divers pseudo-labels. To fully utilize the information within the data, we
adopt inter-sample and intra-sample data augmentation to learn the global and
local knowledge. In addition, to further capture the voxel-level correlations,
we propose label propagation to enhance the model robust. We evaluate our
proposed framework on five benchmark datasets for SSMIS, UMDA, and Semi-MDG
tasks. The results showcase notable improvements compared to state-of-the-art
methods across all five settings, indicating the potential of our framework to
tackle more challenging SSL scenarios.

*Yunqi Miao,Zhiyu Qu,Mingqi Gao,Changrui Chen,Jifei Song,Jungong Han,Jiankang Deng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FLIPNET通过切换恢复和退化模式，解决了盲脸恢复中扩散先验与真实场景的差距问题，提升了真实性和保真度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散先验模型与盲脸恢复（BFR）场景存在差距，主要源于高质量与低质量图像、合成与真实图像的不匹配。

Method: FLIPNET采用统一网络，切换恢复模式（整合BFR特征和面部嵌入）和退化模式（合成真实退化图像）。

Result: 在基准数据集上，FLIPNET在真实性和保真度上优于现有方法，且能更好地模拟真实退化。

Conclusion: FLIPNET有效解决了扩散先验在BFR中的适应问题，为真实场景下的盲脸恢复提供了新思路。

Abstract: Although diffusion prior is rising as a powerful solution for blind face
restoration (BFR), the inherent gap between the vanilla diffusion model and BFR
settings hinders its seamless adaptation. The gap mainly stems from the
discrepancy between 1) high-quality (HQ) and low-quality (LQ) images and 2)
synthesized and real-world images. The vanilla diffusion model is trained on
images with no or less degradations, whereas BFR handles moderately to severely
degraded images. Additionally, LQ images used for training are synthesized by a
naive degradation model with limited degradation patterns, which fails to
simulate complex and unknown degradations in real-world scenarios. In this
work, we use a unified network FLIPNET that switches between two modes to
resolve specific gaps. In Restoration mode, the model gradually integrates
BFR-oriented features and face embeddings from LQ images to achieve authentic
and faithful face restoration. In Degradation mode, the model synthesizes
real-world like degraded images based on the knowledge learned from real-world
degradation datasets. Extensive evaluations on benchmark datasets show that our
model 1) outperforms previous diffusion prior based BFR methods in terms of
authenticity and fidelity, and 2) outperforms the naive degradation model in
modeling the real-world degradations.

Result: 实验证明AutoSAME在左心室分割、关键点定位和指标测量上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: AutoSAME通过结合分割与定位任务，显著提升了左心室测量的准确性和临床一致性。

Abstract: Left ventricular (LV) indicator measurements following clinical
echocardiog-raphy guidelines are important for diagnosing cardiovascular
disease. Alt-hough existing algorithms have explored automated LV
quantification, they can struggle to capture generic visual representations due
to the normally small training datasets. Therefore, it is necessary to
introduce vision founda-tional models (VFM) with abundant knowledge. However,
VFMs represented by the segment anything model (SAM) are usually suitable for
segmentation but incapable of identifying key anatomical points, which are
critical in LV indicator measurements. In this paper, we propose a novel
framework named AutoSAME, combining the powerful visual understanding of SAM
with seg-mentation and landmark localization tasks simultaneously.
Consequently, the framework mimics the operation of cardiac sonographers,
achieving LV indi-cator measurements consistent with clinical guidelines. We
further present fil-tered cross-branch attention (FCBA) in AutoSAME, which
leverages relatively comprehensive features in the segmentation to enhance the
heatmap regression (HR) of key points from the frequency domain perspective,
optimizing the vis-ual representation learned by the latter. Moreover, we
propose spatial-guided prompt alignment (SGPA) to automatically generate prompt
embeddings guid-ed by spatial properties of LV, thereby improving the accuracy
of dense pre-dictions by prior spatial knowledge. The extensive experiments on
an echocar-diography dataset demonstrate the efficiency of each design and the
superiori-ty of our AutoSAME in LV segmentation, landmark localization, and
indicator measurements. The code will be available at

Motivation: 现有方法依赖辅助标注或假设源域和目标域组相同，这些假设不切实际。

Method: 利用预训练的视觉-语言模型，通过梯度注意力分离超类相关和无关特征，并鼓励使用所有超类相关特征进行预测。

Result: 在多样化数据集上的实验表明，该方法在领域泛化任务中显著优于基线，定量和定性均有提升。

Conclusion: 该方法无需标注即可有效应对复杂虚假相关性，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: To enhance group robustness to spurious correlations, prior work often relies
on auxiliary annotations for groups or spurious features and assumes identical
sets of groups across source and target domains. These two requirements are
both unnatural and impractical in real-world settings. To overcome these
limitations, we propose a method that leverages the semantic structure inherent
in class labels--specifically, superclass information--to naturally reduce
reliance on spurious features. Our model employs gradient-based attention
guided by a pre-trained vision-language model to disentangle
superclass-relevant and irrelevant features. Then, by promoting the use of all
superclass-relevant features for prediction, our approach achieves robustness
to more complex spurious correlations without the need to annotate any source
samples. Experiments across diverse datasets demonstrate that our method
significantly outperforms baselines in domain generalization tasks, with clear
improvements in both quantitative metrics and qualitative visualizations.

Result: 在基准数据集和实际案例中，方法在可控性和视频质量上达到最优性能。

Abstract: Generating human videos with realistic and controllable motions is a
challenging task. While existing methods can generate visually compelling
videos, they lack separate control over four key video elements: foreground
subject, background video, human trajectory and action patterns. In this paper,
we propose a decomposed human motion control and video generation framework
that explicitly decouples motion from appearance, subject from background, and
action from trajectory, enabling flexible mix-and-match composition of these
elements. Concretely, we first build a ground-aware 3D world coordinate system
and perform motion editing directly in the 3D space. Trajectory control is
implemented by unprojecting edited 2D trajectories into 3D with focal-length
calibration and coordinate transformation, followed by speed alignment and
orientation adjustment; actions are supplied by a motion bank or generated via
text-to-motion methods. Then, based on modern text-to-video diffusion
transformer models, we inject the subject as tokens for full attention,
concatenate the background along the channel dimension, and add motion
(trajectory and action) control signals by addition. Such a design opens up the
possibility for us to generate realistic videos of anyone doing anything
anywhere. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets and real-world cases
demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on both
element-wise controllability and overall video quality.

TL;DR: DocThinker提出了一种基于规则的强化学习框架，用于动态推理时间推理，解决了现有方法在文档理解中的黑盒问题和适应性不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）在文档理解中表现优异，但其推理过程缺乏透明性，难以在高风险领域（如法律、金融、医疗）中确保可靠性。现有方法使用固定的思维链推理和监督微调，但存在灾难性遗忘、适应性差和跨领域任务泛化能力有限的问题。

Method: DocThinker通过基于规则的强化学习框架动态优化推理策略，生成可解释的中间结果（如结构化推理过程、重述问题、支持答案的兴趣区域和最终答案），并整合多目标规则奖励和KL约束优化。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，DocThinker显著提高了泛化能力，同时生成更可解释和人类可理解的推理步骤。

Conclusion: 强化学习是增强MLLM文档理解中可解释性和适应性的有效替代方案。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable
capabilities in document understanding. However, their reasoning processes
remain largely black-box, making it difficult to ensure reliability and
trustworthiness, especially in high-stakes domains such as legal, financial,
and medical document analysis. Existing methods use fixed Chain-of-Thought
(CoT) reasoning with supervised fine-tuning (SFT) but suffer from catastrophic
forgetting, poor adaptability, and limited generalization across domain tasks.
In this paper, we propose DocThinker, a rule-based Reinforcement Learning (RL)
framework for dynamic inference-time reasoning. Instead of relying on static
CoT templates, DocThinker autonomously refines reasoning strategies via policy
learning, generating explainable intermediate results, including structured
reasoning processes, rephrased questions, regions of interest (RoI) supporting
the answer, and the final answer. By integrating multi-objective rule-based
rewards and KL-constrained optimization, our method mitigates catastrophic
forgetting and enhances both adaptability and transparency. Extensive
experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that DocThinker significantly
improves generalization while producing more explainable and
human-understandable reasoning steps. Our findings highlight RL as a powerful
alternative for enhancing explainability and adaptability in MLLM-based
document understanding. Code will be available at

TL;DR: QueryCraft通过引入语义先验和特征学习改进HOI检测，结合ACTOR和PDQD实现高性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: DETR方法在HOI检测中因查询缺乏语义导致性能不佳，需改进。

Method: 提出QueryCraft框架，结合ACTOR（跨模态Transformer）和PDQD（感知蒸馏查询解码器）优化查询初始化。

Result: 在HICO-Det和V-COCO基准测试中达到最优性能。

Conclusion: QueryCraft通过语义增强和特征学习显著提升HOI检测效果。

Abstract: Human-Object Interaction (HOI) detection aims to localize human-object pairs
and recognize their interactions in images. Although DETR-based methods have
recently emerged as the mainstream framework for HOI detection, they still
suffer from a key limitation: Randomly initialized queries lack explicit
semantics, leading to suboptimal detection performance. To address this
challenge, we propose QueryCraft, a novel plug-and-play HOI detection framework
that incorporates semantic priors and guided feature learning through
transformer-based query initialization. Central to our approach is
\textbf{ACTOR} (\textbf{A}ction-aware \textbf{C}ross-modal
\textbf{T}ransf\textbf{OR}mer), a cross-modal Transformer encoder that jointly
attends to visual regions and textual prompts to extract action-relevant
features. Rather than merely aligning modalities, ACTOR leverages
language-guided attention to infer interaction semantics and produce
semantically meaningful query representations. To further enhance object-level
query quality, we introduce a \textbf{P}erceptual \textbf{D}istilled
\textbf{Q}uery \textbf{D}ecoder (\textbf{PDQD}), which distills object category
awareness from a pre-trained detector to serve as object query initiation. This
dual-branch query initialization enables the model to generate more
interpretable and effective queries for HOI detection. Extensive experiments on
HICO-Det and V-COCO benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves
state-of-the-art performance and strong generalization. Code will be released
upon publication.

Abstract: We present Yan, a foundational framework for interactive video generation,
covering the entire pipeline from simulation and generation to editing.
Specifically, Yan comprises three core modules. AAA-level Simulation: We design
a highly-compressed, low-latency 3D-VAE coupled with a KV-cache-based
shift-window denoising inference process, achieving real-time 1080P/60FPS
interactive simulation. Multi-Modal Generation: We introduce a hierarchical
autoregressive caption method that injects game-specific knowledge into
open-domain multi-modal video diffusion models (VDMs), then transforming the
VDM into a frame-wise, action-controllable, real-time infinite interactive
video generator. Notably, when the textual and visual prompts are sourced from
different domains, the model demonstrates strong generalization, allowing it to
blend and compose the style and mechanics across domains flexibly according to
user prompts. Multi-Granularity Editing: We propose a hybrid model that
explicitly disentangles interactive mechanics simulation from visual rendering,
enabling multi-granularity video content editing during interaction through
text. Collectively, Yan offers an integration of these modules, pushing
interactive video generation beyond isolated capabilities toward a
comprehensive AI-driven interactive creation paradigm, paving the way for the

Motivation: 现有适应迁移方法因模型特定设计和高计算需求，迁移性有限，需更高效解决方案。

Result: TransMiter在视觉识别任务中高效迁移知识，且额外标注数据可进一步提升性能。

Conclusion: TransMiter有效保留泛化能力，适用于不同规模和架构的视觉语言模型。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have been widely used in various visual
recognition tasks due to their remarkable generalization capabilities. As these
models grow in size and complexity, fine-tuning becomes costly, emphasizing the
need to reuse adaptation knowledge from 'weaker' models to efficiently enhance
'stronger' ones. However, existing adaptation transfer methods exhibit limited
transferability across models due to their model-specific design and high
computational demands. To tackle this, we propose Transferable Model-agnostic
adapter (TransMiter), a light-weight adapter that improves vision-language
models 'without backpropagation'. TransMiter captures the knowledge gap between
pre-trained and fine-tuned VLMs, in an 'unsupervised' manner. Once trained,
this knowledge can be seamlessly transferred across different models without
the need for backpropagation. Moreover, TransMiter consists of only a few
layers, inducing a negligible additional inference cost. Notably, supplementing
the process with a few labeled data further yields additional performance gain,
often surpassing a fine-tuned stronger model, with a marginal training cost.
Experimental results and analyses demonstrate that TransMiter effectively and
efficiently transfers adaptation knowledge while preserving generalization
abilities across VLMs of different sizes and architectures in visual
recognition tasks.

Abstract: Shooting video with a handheld mobile phone, the most common photographic
device, often results in blurry frames due to shaking hands and other
instability factors. Although previous video deblurring methods have achieved
impressive progress, they still struggle to perform satisfactorily on
real-world handheld video due to the blur domain gap between training and
testing data. To address the issue, we propose a self-supervised method for
handheld video deblurring, which is driven by sharp clues in the video. First,
to train the deblurring model, we extract the sharp clues from the video and
take them as misalignment labels of neighboring blurry frames. Second, to
improve the model's ability, we propose a novel Self-Enhanced Video Deblurring
(SEVD) method to create higher-quality paired video data. Third, we propose a
Self-Constrained Spatial Consistency Maintenance (SCSCM) method to regularize
the model, preventing position shifts between the output and input frames.
Moreover, we construct a synthetic and a real-world handheld video dataset for
handheld video deblurring. Extensive experiments on these two and other common
real-world datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms
existing self-supervised ones. The code and datasets are publicly available at

Abstract: Neural artistic style transfers and blends the content and style
representation of one image with the style of another. This enables artists to
create unique innovative visuals and enhances artistic expression in various
fields including art, design, and film. Color transfer algorithms are an
important in digital image processing by adjusting the color information in a
target image based on the colors in the source image. Color transfer enhances
images and videos in film and photography, and can aid in image correction. We
introduce a methodology that combines neural artistic style with color
transfer. The method uses the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence to
quantitatively evaluate color and luminance histogram matching algorithms
including Reinhard global color transfer, iteration distribution transfer
(IDT), IDT with regrain, Cholesky, and PCA between the original and neural
artistic style transferred image using deep learning. We estimate the color
channel kernel densities. Various experiments are performed to evaluate the KL
of these algorithms and their color histograms for style to content transfer.

Result: HVPL模型在避免遗忘旧类别方面优于基线方法。

Conclusion: HVPL模型有效解决了视频实例分割中的灾难性遗忘问题。

Abstract: Video instance segmentation (VIS) has gained significant attention for its
capability in tracking and segmenting object instances across video frames.
However, most of the existing VIS approaches unrealistically assume that the
categories of object instances remain fixed over time. Moreover, they
experience catastrophic forgetting of old classes when required to continuously
learn object instances belonging to new categories. To resolve these
challenges, we develop a novel Hierarchical Visual Prompt Learning (HVPL) model
that overcomes catastrophic forgetting of previous categories from both
frame-level and video-level perspectives. Specifically, to mitigate forgetting
at the frame level, we devise a task-specific frame prompt and an orthogonal
gradient correction (OGC) module. The OGC module helps the frame prompt encode
task-specific global instance information for new classes in each individual
frame by projecting its gradients onto the orthogonal feature space of old
classes. Furthermore, to address forgetting at the video level, we design a
task-specific video prompt and a video context decoder. This decoder first
embeds structural inter-class relationships across frames into the frame prompt
features, and then propagates task-specific global video contexts from the
frame prompt features to the video prompt. Through rigorous comparisons, our
HVPL model proves to be more effective than baseline approaches. The code is
available at https://github.com/JiahuaDong/HVPL.

Conclusion: AME是一种即插即用的模块，无需修改主干架构，即可显著提升视觉-语言知识蒸馏的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Knowledge distillation is a long-established technique for knowledge
transfer, and has regained attention in the context of the recent emergence of
large vision-language models (VLMs). However, vision-language knowledge
distillation often requires sufficient training data to achieve robust
generalization on amples with ambiguous or boundary-adjacent representations,
which are associated with high predictive uncertainty. Critically, collecting
such large-scale, task-specific data for training is often impractical in
real-world scenarios. To address this major challenge arising from the
entanglement of uncertainty and cross-modal feature representation, we propose
Aligned Manifold Entropy for Robust Vision-Language Distillation (AME), aiming
to achieve robust generalization under real-world conditions. AME applies
entropy minimization over a reconfigured shared manifold, where multi-modal
data (i.e., image and text) are bridged through a pair of projection functions,
conducive to structural compression for cross-modal feature representations.
This enables robust knowledge distillation under low-data regimes, while
requiring no architectural modifications to the backbone. As a result, it can
serve as a plug-and-play module compatible with a wide range of vision-language
distillation frameworks. Notably, our theoretical analysis reveals that
integrating knowledge distillation with entropy minimization over the shared
manifold leads to a tighter generalization error bound. Extensive experiments
across diverse distillation architectures and training settings demonstrate
that AME consistently facilitates robust knowledge distillation, resulting in
superior generalization performance across a wide spectrum of downstream tasks.

Conclusion: 框架具有强解释性和适应性，支持平滑形状操作。

Abstract: Most prior unsupervised domain adaptation approaches for medical image
segmentation are narrowly tailored to either the source-accessible setting,
where adaptation is guided by source-target alignment, or the source-free
setting, which typically resorts to implicit supervision mechanisms such as
pseudo-labeling and model distillation. This substantial divergence in
methodological designs between the two settings reveals an inherent flaw: the
lack of an explicit, structured construction of anatomical knowledge that
naturally generalizes across domains and settings. To bridge this longstanding
divide, we introduce a unified, semantically grounded framework that supports
both source-accessible and source-free adaptation. Fundamentally distinct from
all prior works, our framework's adaptability emerges naturally as a direct
consequence of the model architecture, without the need for any handcrafted
adaptation strategies. Specifically, our model learns a domain-agnostic
probabilistic manifold as a global space of anatomical regularities, mirroring
how humans establish visual understanding. Thus, the structural content in each
image can be interpreted as a canonical anatomy retrieved from the manifold and
a spatial transformation capturing individual-specific geometry. This
disentangled, interpretable formulation enables semantically meaningful
prediction with intrinsic adaptability. Extensive experiments on challenging
cardiac and abdominal datasets show that our framework achieves
state-of-the-art results in both settings, with source-free performance closely
approaching its source-accessible counterpart, a level of consistency rarely
observed in prior works. Beyond quantitative improvement, we demonstrate strong
interpretability of the proposed framework via manifold traversal for smooth
shape manipulation.

Conclusion: HiWL通过分层学习有效解决了水印技术的三大核心问题，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Deep image watermarking, which refers to enable imperceptible watermark
embedding and reliable extraction in cover images, has shown to be effective
for copyright protection of image assets. However, existing methods face
limitations in simultaneously satisfying three essential criteria for
generalizable watermarking: 1) invisibility (imperceptible hide of watermarks),
2) robustness (reliable watermark recovery under diverse conditions), and 3)
broad applicability (low latency in watermarking process). To address these
limitations, we propose a Hierarchical Watermark Learning (HiWL), a two-stage
optimization that enable a watermarking model to simultaneously achieve three
criteria. In the first stage, distribution alignment learning is designed to
establish a common latent space with two constraints: 1) visual consistency
between watermarked and non-watermarked images, and 2) information invariance
across watermark latent representations. In this way, multi-modal inputs
including watermark message (binary codes) and cover images (RGB pixels) can be
well represented, ensuring the invisibility of watermarks and robustness in
watermarking process thereby. The second stage employs generalized watermark
representation learning to establish a disentanglement policy for separating
watermarks from image content in RGB space. In particular, it strongly
penalizes substantial fluctuations in separated RGB watermarks corresponding to
identical messages. Consequently, HiWL effectively learns generalizable
latent-space watermark representations while maintaining broad applicability.
Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed method. In
particular, it achieves 7.6\% higher accuracy in watermark extraction than
existing methods, while maintaining extremely low latency (100K images
processed in 8s).

Conclusion: MMIF-AMIN在多模态医学图像融合任务中表现出色，并可扩展至其他图像融合任务。

Abstract: Multimodal medical image fusion (MMIF) aims to integrate images from
different modalities to produce a comprehensive image that enhances medical
diagnosis by accurately depicting organ structures, tissue textures, and
metabolic information. Capturing both the unique and complementary information
across multiple modalities simultaneously is a key research challenge in MMIF.
To address this challenge, this paper proposes a novel image fusion method,
MMIF-AMIN, which features a new architecture that can effectively extract these
unique and complementary features. Specifically, an Invertible Dense Network
(IDN) is employed for lossless feature extraction from individual modalities.
To extract complementary information between modalities, a Multi-scale
Complementary Feature Extraction Module (MCFEM) is designed, which incorporates
a hybrid attention mechanism, convolutional layers of varying sizes, and
Transformers. An adaptive loss function is introduced to guide model learning,
addressing the limitations of traditional manually-designed loss functions and
enhancing the depth of data mining. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
MMIF-AMIN outperforms nine state-of-the-art MMIF methods, delivering superior
results in both quantitative and qualitative analyses. Ablation experiments
confirm the effectiveness of each component of the proposed method.
Additionally, extending MMIF-AMIN to other image fusion tasks also achieves
promising performance.

Result: 实验表明，PADReg的HD95为12.90，比现有方法提高了21.34%。

Conclusion: PADReg通过引入物理先验，实现了更符合解剖结构的配准效果。

Abstract: Ultrasound deformable registration estimates spatial transformations between
pairs of deformed ultrasound images, which is crucial for capturing
biomechanical properties and enhancing diagnostic accuracy in diseases such as
thyroid nodules and breast cancer. However, ultrasound deformable registration
remains highly challenging, especially under large deformation. The inherently
low contrast, heavy noise and ambiguous tissue boundaries in ultrasound images
severely hinder reliable feature extraction and correspondence matching.
Existing methods often suffer from poor anatomical alignment and lack physical
interpretability. To address the problem, we propose PADReg, a physics-aware
deformable registration framework guided by contact force. PADReg leverages
synchronized contact force measured by robotic ultrasound systems as a physical
prior to constrain the registration. Specifically, instead of directly
predicting deformation fields, we first construct a pixel-wise stiffness map
utilizing the multi-modal information from contact force and ultrasound images.
The stiffness map is then combined with force data to estimate a dense
deformation field, through a lightweight physics-aware module inspired by
Hooke's law. This design enables PADReg to achieve physically plausible

*Tong Sun,Hongliang Ye,Jilin Mei,Liang Chen,Fangzhou Zhao,Leiqiang Zong,Yu Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为ROD的RGB-only方法，用于越野自由空间检测，消除了对LiDAR数据的依赖，提高了推理速度和精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 越野场景中自由空间检测的边界模糊，现有基于多模态（RGB和LiDAR）的方法因计算表面法线图导致推理时间增加，不适合实时应用。

Method: 利用预训练的Vision Transformer（ViT）从RGB图像中提取丰富特征，并设计轻量高效的解码器。

Result: ROD在ORFD和RELLIS-3D数据集上达到新的SOTA，推理速度达50 FPS，显著优于先前模型。

Conclusion: ROD通过RGB-only方法实现了高效且实时的越野自由空间检测，为实际应用提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Off-road freespace detection is more challenging than on-road scenarios
because of the blurred boundaries of traversable areas. Previous
state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods employ multi-modal fusion of RGB images and
LiDAR data. However, due to the significant increase in inference time when
calculating surface normal maps from LiDAR data, multi-modal methods are not
suitable for real-time applications, particularly in real-world scenarios where
higher FPS is required compared to slow navigation. This paper presents a novel
RGB-only approach for off-road freespace detection, named ROD, eliminating the
reliance on LiDAR data and its computational demands. Specifically, we utilize
a pre-trained Vision Transformer (ViT) to extract rich features from RGB
images. Additionally, we design a lightweight yet efficient decoder, which
together improve both precision and inference speed. ROD establishes a new SOTA
on ORFD and RELLIS-3D datasets, as well as an inference speed of 50 FPS,
significantly outperforming prior models.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一个名为LIVE-YT-Banding的新视频数据集，用于研究压缩视频中的条带伪影问题，并开发了一种高效的无参考视频质量评估模型CBAND。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高清晰度视频中的条带伪影严重影响观看体验，但现有数据集仅限于静态图像，无法捕捉时间动态。

Method: 创建了包含160个视频的LIVE-YT-Banding数据集，收集了7,200条主观评价，并开发了基于深度神经网络嵌入的CBAND模型。

Result: CBAND在条带伪影预测性能上显著优于现有模型，且速度更快，还可作为可微损失函数优化视频去条带模型。

Conclusion: LIVE-YT-Banding数据集和CBAND模型为视频质量评估提供了新资源，CBAND表现出色且实用。

Abstract: Although there have been notable advancements in video compression
technologies in recent years, banding artifacts remain a serious issue
affecting the quality of compressed videos, particularly on smooth regions of
high-definition videos. Noticeable banding artifacts can severely impact the
perceptual quality of videos viewed on a high-end HDTV or high-resolution
screen. Hence, there is a pressing need for a systematic investigation of the
banding video quality assessment problem for advanced video codecs. Given that
the existing publicly available datasets for studying banding artifacts are
limited to still picture data only, which cannot account for temporal banding
dynamics, we have created a first-of-a-kind open video dataset, dubbed
LIVE-YT-Banding, which consists of 160 videos generated by four different
compression parameters using the AV1 video codec. A total of 7,200 subjective
opinions are collected from a cohort of 45 human subjects. To demonstrate the
value of this new resources, we tested and compared a variety of models that
detect banding occurrences, and measure their impact on perceived quality.
Among these, we introduce an effective and efficient new no-reference (NR)
video quality evaluator which we call CBAND. CBAND leverages the properties of
the learned statistics of natural images expressed in the embeddings of deep
neural networks. Our experimental results show that the perceptual banding
prediction performance of CBAND significantly exceeds that of previous
state-of-the-art models, and is also orders of magnitude faster. Moreover,
CBAND can be employed as a differentiable loss function to optimize video
debanding models. The LIVE-YT-Banding database, code, and pre-trained model are
all publically available at https://github.com/uniqzheng/CBAND.

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著减少了罕见案例相关的错误，提升了模型鲁棒性且未引入新问题。

Conclusion: 提出的针对性修复策略有效解决了罕见语义子群问题，提升了视觉识别模型的性能。

Abstract: Deep learning models for visual recognition often exhibit systematic errors
due to underrepresented semantic subpopulations. Although existing debugging
frameworks can pinpoint these failures by identifying key failure attributes,
repairing the model effectively remains difficult. Current solutions often rely
on manually designed prompts to generate synthetic training images -- an
approach prone to distribution shift and semantic errors. To overcome these
challenges, we introduce a model repair module that builds on an interpretable
failure attribution pipeline. Our approach uses a conditional text-to-image
model to generate semantically faithful and targeted images for failure cases.
To preserve the quality and relevance of the generated samples, we further
employ a large vision-language model (LVLM) to filter the outputs, enforcing
alignment with the original data distribution and maintaining semantic
consistency. By retraining vision models with this rare-case-augmented
synthetic dataset, we significantly reduce errors associated with rare cases.
Our experiments demonstrate that this targeted repair strategy improves model
robustness without introducing new bugs. Code is available at

*Zunjie Xiao,Xiao Wu,Tianhang Liu,Lingxi Hu,Yinling Zhang,Xiaoqing Zhang,Risa Higashita,Jiang Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种自适应置信度损失（ACW）方法，通过动态调整置信度阈值优化镜头结构分割，显著提升了分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度分割网络对所有像素平等加权，忽略了镜头结构子区域的不均匀性和边界区域的校准问题。专家注释时对不同子区域赋予不同置信度，因此提出ACW损失以利用这一先验知识。

Method: ACW将目标区域分为低置信度和高置信度组，应用区域加权损失；设计了自适应置信度阈值优化算法；提出边界预期校准误差（BECE）度量边界分割的校准误差。

Result: 在临床AS-OCT数据集上，ACW显著优于其他分割损失方法，U-Net下IoU提升6.13%，DSC增加4.33%，BECE降低4.79%。

Conclusion: ACW损失有效利用了专家注释的置信度先验，显著提升了镜头结构分割的准确性和边界校准。

Abstract: Precise lens structure segmentation is essential for the design of
intraocular lenses (IOLs) in cataract surgery. Existing deep segmentation
networks typically weight all pixels equally under cross-entropy (CE) loss,
overlooking the fact that sub-regions of lens structures are inhomogeneous
(e.g., some regions perform better than others) and that boundary regions often
suffer from poor segmentation calibration at the pixel level. Clinically,
experts annotate different sub-regions of lens structures with varying
confidence levels, considering factors such as sub-region proportions,
ambiguous boundaries, and lens structure shapes. Motivated by this observation,
we propose an Adaptive Confidence-Wise (ACW) loss to group each lens structure
sub-region into different confidence sub-regions via a confidence threshold
from the unique region aspect, aiming to exploit the potential of expert
annotation confidence prior. Specifically, ACW clusters each target region into
low-confidence and high-confidence groups and then applies a region-weighted
loss to reweigh each confidence group. Moreover, we design an adaptive
confidence threshold optimization algorithm to adjust the confidence threshold
of ACW dynamically. Additionally, to better quantify the miscalibration errors
in boundary region segmentation, we propose a new metric, termed Boundary
Expected Calibration Error (BECE). Extensive experiments on a clinical lens
structure AS-OCT dataset and other multi-structure datasets demonstrate that
our ACW significantly outperforms competitive segmentation loss methods across
different deep segmentation networks (e.g., MedSAM). Notably, our method
surpasses CE with 6.13% IoU gain, 4.33% DSC increase, and 4.79% BECE reduction
in lens structure segmentation under U-Net. The code of this paper is available

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种框架，通过模拟社交网络的视频共享管道来生成压缩和调整大小的参数，以解决AI生成视频检测在真实场景中的泛化问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交网络上的AI生成视频检测面临挑战，因为受控条件下训练的检测器难以泛化到真实场景，主要原因是平台压缩破坏了低级取证线索。

Method: 提出了一种框架，通过从少量上传视频中估计压缩和调整大小参数，模拟社交网络的视频共享管道，生成平台特定的伪影。

Result: 实验表明，模拟数据与真实上传视频的退化模式高度匹配，且基于模拟视频微调的检测器性能与基于真实共享媒体训练的检测器相当。

Conclusion: 该方法为缩小实验室训练与真实部署之间的差距提供了可扩展的解决方案，特别是在压缩视频内容领域。

Abstract: The growing presence of AI-generated videos on social networks poses new
challenges for deepfake detection, as detectors trained under controlled
conditions often fail to generalize to real-world scenarios. A key factor
behind this gap is the aggressive, proprietary compression applied by platforms
like YouTube and Facebook, which launder low-level forensic cues. However,
replicating these transformations at scale is difficult due to API limitations
and data-sharing constraints. For these reasons, we propose a first framework
that emulates the video sharing pipelines of social networks by estimating
compression and resizing parameters from a small set of uploaded videos. These
parameters enable a local emulator capable of reproducing platform-specific
artifacts on large datasets without direct API access. Experiments on
FaceForensics++ videos shared via social networks demonstrate that our emulated
data closely matches the degradation patterns of real uploads. Furthermore,
detectors fine-tuned on emulated videos achieve comparable performance to those
trained on actual shared media. Our approach offers a scalable and practical
solution for bridging the gap between lab-based training and real-world
deployment of deepfake detectors, particularly in the underexplored domain of
compressed video content.

TL;DR: ROOMELSA是一个新基准，用于评估系统在复杂场景中通过自然语言描述检索3D模型的能力，包含大量场景和查询数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D检索系统仅适用于简单场景，而真实世界需要从杂乱场景和模糊描述中识别对象。

Method: ROOMELSA通过全景房间图像中的特定区域检索对应3D模型，包含1600多个公寓场景和44000多个查询。

Result: 粗粒度检索已解决，但仅一个模型在所有测试中表现最佳；轻量级CLIP模型表现良好，但在细节上仍有不足。

Conclusion: ROOMELSA为推进真实世界3D识别系统提供了新基准，强调视觉与语言理解的紧密结合。

Abstract: Recent 3D retrieval systems are typically designed for simple, controlled
scenarios, such as identifying an object from a cropped image or a brief
description. However, real-world scenarios are more complex, often requiring
the recognition of an object in a cluttered scene based on a vague, free-form
description. To this end, we present ROOMELSA, a new benchmark designed to
evaluate a system's ability to interpret natural language. Specifically,
ROOMELSA attends to a specific region within a panoramic room image and
accurately retrieves the corresponding 3D model from a large database. In
addition, ROOMELSA includes over 1,600 apartment scenes, nearly 5,200 rooms,
and more than 44,000 targeted queries. Empirically, while coarse object
retrieval is largely solved, only one top-performing model consistently ranked
the correct match first across nearly all test cases. Notably, a lightweight
CLIP-based model also performed well, although it struggled with subtle
variations in materials, part structures, and contextual cues, resulting in
occasional errors. These findings highlight the importance of tightly
integrating visual and language understanding. By bridging the gap between
scene-level grounding and fine-grained 3D retrieval, ROOMELSA establishes a new
benchmark for advancing robust, real-world 3D recognition systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动物姿态估计在生态监测、行为分析和智能畜牧管理中具有重要价值，但由于物种形态多样性高、身体结构复杂和标注数据有限，该任务比人类姿态估计更具挑战性。

Method: 提出DiffPose-Animal框架，将姿态估计重新定义为扩散模型下的去噪过程，利用大语言模型提取全局解剖学先验和局部关键点语义，并通过交叉注意力模块与图像特征融合。设计扩散式关键点解码器逐步优化预测。

Conclusion: DiffPose-Animal通过结合扩散模型和大语言模型，显著提升了动物姿态估计的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Animal pose estimation is a fundamental task in computer vision, with growing
importance in ecological monitoring, behavioral analysis, and intelligent
livestock management. Compared to human pose estimation, animal pose estimation
is more challenging due to high interspecies morphological diversity, complex
body structures, and limited annotated data. In this work, we introduce
DiffPose-Animal, a novel diffusion-based framework for top-down animal pose
estimation. Unlike traditional heatmap regression methods, DiffPose-Animal
reformulates pose estimation as a denoising process under the generative
framework of diffusion models. To enhance semantic guidance during keypoint
generation, we leverage large language models (LLMs) to extract both global
anatomical priors and local keypoint-wise semantics based on species-specific
prompts. These textual priors are encoded and fused with image features via
cross-attention modules to provide biologically meaningful constraints
throughout the denoising process. Additionally, a diffusion-based keypoint
decoder is designed to progressively refine pose predictions, improving
robustness to occlusion and annotation sparsity. Extensive experiments on
public animal pose datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization
capability of our method, especially under challenging scenarios with diverse
species, cluttered backgrounds, and incomplete keypoints.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于区域自适应的视频锐化模型RPO-AdaSharp，用于感知增强和比特率节省。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统均匀锐化强度忽略了纹理变化，导致视频质量下降，同时增加比特率，缺乏优化比特分配的技术。

Method: 利用编码树单元（CTU）分区掩码作为先验信息，指导并约束增加的比特分配。

Result: 在基准测试中，模型在定性和定量上均表现出有效性。

Conclusion: RPO-AdaSharp模型成功实现了区域自适应的视频锐化，兼顾感知质量和比特率优化。

Abstract: Sharpening is a widely adopted video enhancement technique. However, uniform
sharpening intensity ignores texture variations, degrading video quality.
Sharpening also increases bitrate, and there's a lack of techniques to
optimally allocate these additional bits across diverse regions. Thus, this
paper proposes RPO-AdaSharp, an end-to-end region-adaptive video sharpening
model for both perceptual enhancement and bitrate savings. We use the coding
tree unit (CTU) partition mask as prior information to guide and constrain the
allocation of increased bits. Experiments on benchmarks demonstrate the
effectiveness of the proposed model qualitatively and quantitatively.

TL;DR: MonoPartNeRF提出了一种用于单目动态人体渲染的新框架，通过双向变形模型和部分姿态嵌入机制，解决了复杂姿态变化和遮挡恢复问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在复杂姿态变化和遮挡恢复方面表现不佳，导致边界过渡不自然和遮挡区域重建不准确。

Method: 提出双向变形模型结合刚性和非刚性变换，引入部分姿态嵌入机制和关键帧姿态检索，结合注意力机制建模动态纹理变化。

Result: 在ZJU-MoCap和MonoCap数据集上显著优于现有方法，实现了更好的姿态对齐、纹理保真和结构连续性。

Conclusion: MonoPartNeRF在复杂姿态和遮挡条件下表现优异，为动态人体渲染提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: In recent years, Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) have achieved remarkable
progress in dynamic human reconstruction and rendering. Part-based rendering
paradigms, guided by human segmentation, allow for flexible parameter
allocation based on structural complexity, thereby enhancing representational
efficiency. However, existing methods still struggle with complex pose
variations, often producing unnatural transitions at part boundaries and
failing to reconstruct occluded regions accurately in monocular settings. We
propose MonoPartNeRF, a novel framework for monocular dynamic human rendering
that ensures smooth transitions and robust occlusion recovery. First, we build
a bidirectional deformation model that combines rigid and non-rigid
transformations to establish a continuous, reversible mapping between
observation and canonical spaces. Sampling points are projected into a
parameterized surface-time space (u, v, t) to better capture non-rigid motion.
A consistency loss further suppresses deformation-induced artifacts and
discontinuities. We introduce a part-based pose embedding mechanism that
decomposes global pose vectors into local joint embeddings based on body
regions. This is combined with keyframe pose retrieval and interpolation, along
three orthogonal directions, to guide pose-aware feature sampling. A learnable
appearance code is integrated via attention to model dynamic texture changes
effectively. Experiments on the ZJU-MoCap and MonoCap datasets demonstrate that
our method significantly outperforms prior approaches under complex pose and
occlusion conditions, achieving superior joint alignment, texture fidelity, and
structural continuity.

Result: 生成了一个公开数据集，可用于跨年龄人脸识别和合成图像检测的基准测试。

Conclusion: 该方法简单实用，能有效生成年龄变化的人脸图像并保留身份信息。

Abstract: Face aging or de-aging with generative AI has gained significant attention
for its applications in such fields like forensics, security, and media.
However, most state of the art methods rely on conditional Generative
Adversarial Networks (GANs), Diffusion-based models, or Visual Language Models
(VLMs) to age or de-age faces based on predefined age categories and
conditioning via loss functions, fine-tuning, or text prompts. The reliance on
such conditioning leads to complex training requirements, increased data needs,
and challenges in generating consistent results. Additionally, identity
preservation is rarely taken into accountor evaluated on a single face
recognition system without any control or guarantees on whether identity would
be preserved in a generated aged/de-aged face. In this paper, we propose to
synthesize aged and de-aged faces via editing latent space of StyleGAN2 using a
simple support vector modeling of aging/de-aging direction and several feature
selection approaches. By using two state-of-the-art face recognition systems,
we empirically find the identity preserving subspace within the StyleGAN2
latent space, so that an apparent age of a given face can changed while
preserving the identity. We then propose a simple yet practical formula for
estimating the limits on aging/de-aging parameters that ensures identity
preservation for a given input face. Using our method and estimated parameters
we have generated a public dataset of synthetic faces at different ages that
can be used for benchmarking cross-age face recognition, age assurance systems,
or systems for detection of synthetic images. Our code and dataset are
available at the project page https://www.idiap.ch/paper/agesynth/

Motivation: 现有轻量级语义分割方法在实时推理中表现良好，但其基于逐像素分类的范式导致类别表示与图像特征不对齐，限制了性能。

Method: 提出了一种耦合双分支偏移学习范式，显式学习特征和类别偏移以动态优化表示。基于此构建了高效网络OffSeg，并可无缝应用于现有方法。

Result: 在四个数据集（ADE20K、Cityscapes等）上验证，性能显著提升（如ADE20K上SegFormer-B0提升2.7% mIoU），且仅需少量额外参数（0.1-0.2M）。

Conclusion: 偏移学习范式有效解决了类别与特征不对齐问题，显著提升了轻量级语义分割模型的性能，且易于集成到现有方法中。

Abstract: Semantic segmentation is fundamental to vision systems requiring pixel-level
scene understanding, yet deploying it on resource-constrained devices demands
efficient architectures. Although existing methods achieve real-time inference
through lightweight designs, we reveal their inherent limitation: misalignment
between class representations and image features caused by a per-pixel
classification paradigm. With experimental analysis, we find that this paradigm
results in a highly challenging assumption for efficient scenarios: Image pixel
features should not vary for the same category in different images. To address
this dilemma, we propose a coupled dual-branch offset learning paradigm that
explicitly learns feature and class offsets to dynamically refine both class
representations and spatial image features. Based on the proposed paradigm, we
construct an efficient semantic segmentation network, OffSeg. Notably, the
offset learning paradigm can be adopted to existing methods with no additional
architectural changes. Extensive experiments on four datasets, including
ADE20K, Cityscapes, COCO-Stuff-164K, and Pascal Context, demonstrate consistent
improvements with negligible parameters. For instance, on the ADE20K dataset,
our proposed offset learning paradigm improves SegFormer-B0, SegNeXt-T, and
Mask2Former-Tiny by 2.7%, 1.9%, and 2.6% mIoU, respectively, with only 0.1-0.2M
additional parameters required.

Motivation: 现有基于LoRA的方法在多概念生成时存在身份丢失和视觉特征泄漏问题，需要改进。

Method: 提出Token-Aware LoRA (TARA)，引入令牌掩码和空间对齐训练目标，避免模块间干扰。

Result: TARA实现了无需训练的多概念组合，有效保留了每个概念的视觉身份。

Conclusion: TARA通过避免LoRA模块间的相互干扰，提升了多概念生成的效率和效果。

Abstract: Personalized text-to-image generation aims to synthesize novel images of a
specific subject or style using only a few reference images. Recent methods
based on Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) enable efficient single-concept
customization by injecting lightweight, concept-specific adapters into
pre-trained diffusion models. However, combining multiple LoRA modules for
multi-concept generation often leads to identity missing and visual feature
leakage. In this work, we identify two key issues behind these failures: (1)
token-wise interference among different LoRA modules, and (2) spatial
misalignment between the attention map of a rare token and its corresponding
concept-specific region. To address these issues, we propose Token-Aware LoRA
(TARA), which introduces a token mask to explicitly constrain each module to
focus on its associated rare token to avoid interference, and a training
objective that encourages the spatial attention of a rare token to align with
its concept region. Our method enables training-free multi-concept composition
by directly injecting multiple independently trained TARA modules at inference
time. Experimental results demonstrate that TARA enables efficient
multi-concept inference and effectively preserving the visual identity of each
concept by avoiding mutual interference between LoRA modules. The code and
models are available at https://github.com/YuqiPeng77/TARA.

Abstract: Recent Multi-Modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated strong
capabilities in learning joint representations from text and images. However,
their spatial reasoning remains limited. We introduce 3DFroMLLM, a novel
framework that enables the generation of 3D object prototypes directly from
MLLMs, including geometry and part labels. Our pipeline is agentic, comprising
a designer, coder, and visual inspector operating in a refinement loop.
Notably, our approach requires no additional training data or detailed user
instructions. Building on prior work in 2D generation, we demonstrate that
rendered images produced by our framework can be effectively used for image
classification pretraining tasks and outperforms previous methods by 15%. As a
compelling real-world use case, we show that the generated prototypes can be
leveraged to improve fine-grained vision-language models by using the rendered,
part-labeled prototypes to fine-tune CLIP for part segmentation and achieving a
55% accuracy improvement without relying on any additional human-labeled data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发一种无需参考图像即可评估图像质量的框架，通过分析方向性图像曲率来量化图像退化。

Method: 定义ATR度量，使用两个可调阈值计算像素级纹理抑制；通过两阶段系统（分类和回归）评估图像质量。

Result: 在LIVE数据集上，ATR对高斯模糊和白噪声的Spearman相关性分别达到-0.93和-0.95；分类准确率超过97%，R2为0.892，RMSE为5.17 DMOS。

Conclusion: 该框架是一种高效的双用途工具，可用于图像退化的分类和量化。

Abstract: This work presents a novel framework for No-Reference Image Quality
Assessment (NR-IQA) founded on the analysis of directional image curvature.
Within this framework, we define a measure of Anisotropic Texture Richness
(ATR), which is computed at the pixel level using two tunable thresholds -- one
permissive and one restrictive -- that quantify orthogonal texture suppression.
When its parameters are optimized for a specific artifact, the resulting ATR
score serves as a high-performance quality metric, achieving Spearman
correlations with human perception of approximately -0.93 for Gaussian blur and
-0.95 for white noise on the LIVE dataset. The primary contribution is a
two-stage system that leverages the differential response of ATR to various
distortions. First, the system utilizes the signature from two specialist ATR
configurations to classify the primary artifact type (blur vs. noise) with over
97% accuracy. Second, following classification, it employs a dedicated
regression model mapping the relevant ATR score to a quality rating to quantify
the degradation. On a combined dataset, the complete system predicts human
scores with a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.892 and a Root Mean Square
Error (RMSE) of 5.17 DMOS points. This error corresponds to just 7.4% of the
dataset's total quality range, demonstrating high predictive accuracy. This
establishes our framework as a robust, dual-purpose tool for the classification
and subsequent quantification of image degradation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于学习的自适应高频预处理框架，通过FFPN预测最佳预处理策略，优化视频编码的比特率与质量平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高频分量对视频清晰度和真实感至关重要，但会增加编码比特率，导致带宽和存储成本上升。

Method: 使用FFPN预测最佳高频预处理策略，并通过伪标签训练，比较不同预处理类型和强度的率失真性能。

Result: 在多数据集上的评估表明，该框架能显著提升主观质量并节省比特率。

Conclusion: 该框架在视频编码中实现了比特率与质量的最佳权衡，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: High-frequency components are crucial for maintaining video clarity and
realism, but they also significantly impact coding bitrate, resulting in
increased bandwidth and storage costs. This paper presents an end-to-end
learning-based framework for adaptive high-frequency preprocessing to enhance
subjective quality and save bitrate in video coding. The framework employs the
Frequency-attentive Feature pyramid Prediction Network (FFPN) to predict the
optimal high-frequency preprocessing strategy, guiding subsequent filtering
operators to achieve the optimal tradeoff between bitrate and quality after
compression. For training FFPN, we pseudo-label each training video with the
optimal strategy, determined by comparing the rate-distortion (RD) performance
across different preprocessing types and strengths. Distortion is measured
using the latest quality assessment metric. Comprehensive evaluations on
multiple datasets demonstrate the visually appealing enhancement capabilities
and bitrate savings achieved by our framework.

Abstract: Novel view synthesis with neural models has advanced rapidly in recent years,
yet adapting these models to scene changes remains an open problem. Existing
methods are either labor-intensive, requiring extensive model retraining, or
fail to capture detailed types of changes over time. In this paper, we present
GaussianUpdate, a novel approach that combines 3D Gaussian representation with
continual learning to address these challenges. Our method effectively updates
the Gaussian radiance fields with current data while preserving information
from past scenes. Unlike existing methods, GaussianUpdate explicitly models
different types of changes through a novel multi-stage update strategy.
Additionally, we introduce a visibility-aware continual learning approach with
generative replay, enabling self-aware updating without the need to store
images. The experiments on the benchmark dataset demonstrate our method
achieves superior and real-time rendering with the capability of visualizing
changes over different times

Abstract: Robust depth estimation in light field imaging remains a critical challenge
for pattern recognition applications such as augmented reality, biomedical
imaging, and scene reconstruction. While existing approaches often rely heavily
on deep convolutional neural networks, they tend to incur high computational
costs and struggle in noisy real-world environments. This paper proposes a
novel lightweight depth estimation pipeline that integrates light field-based
disparity information with a directed random walk refinement algorithm. Unlike
traditional CNN-based methods, our approach enhances depth map consistency
without requiring extensive training or large-scale datasets. The proposed
method was evaluated on the 4D Light Field Benchmark dataset and a diverse set
of real-world images. Experimental results indicate that while performance
slightly declines under uncontrolled conditions, the algorithm consistently
maintains low computational complexity and competitive accuracy compared to
state-of-the-art deep learning models. These findings highlight the potential
of our method as a robust and efficient alternative for depth estimation and
segmentation in light field imaging. The work provides insights into practical
algorithm design for light field-based pattern recognition and opens new
directions for integrating probabilistic graph models with depth sensing
frameworks.

Conclusion: MaskClu通过联合优化密集语义重建和实例级对比学习，使ViTs能够从3D点云中学习更丰富且语义更有意义的表示。

Abstract: Vision transformers (ViTs) have recently been widely applied to 3D point
cloud understanding, with masked autoencoding as the predominant pre-training
paradigm. However, the challenge of learning dense and informative semantic
features from point clouds via standard ViTs remains underexplored. We propose
MaskClu, a novel unsupervised pre-training method for ViTs on 3D point clouds
that integrates masked point modeling with clustering-based learning. MaskClu
is designed to reconstruct both cluster assignments and cluster centers from
masked point clouds, thus encouraging the model to capture dense semantic
information. Additionally, we introduce a global contrastive learning mechanism
that enhances instance-level feature learning by contrasting different masked
views of the same point cloud. By jointly optimizing these complementary
objectives, i.e., dense semantic reconstruction, and instance-level contrastive
learning. MaskClu enables ViTs to learn richer and more semantically meaningful
representations from 3D point clouds. We validate the effectiveness of our
method via multiple 3D tasks, including part segmentation, semantic
segmentation, object detection, and classification, where MaskClu sets new
competitive results. The code and models will be released
at:https://github.com/Amazingren/maskclu.

Motivation: 目前大多数自动化肿瘤分割和报告生成研究集中在术前数据，术后影像分析研究较少，因此需要一种标准化方法。

Method: 使用Attention U-Net训练分割模型（术前非增强肿瘤核心、术后增强残留肿瘤和切除腔），以及DenseNet进行MR序列分类和肿瘤类型识别，整合为报告流程。

Conclusion: 该流程实现了自动化分割、分类和标准化报告生成，提升了术后评估和临床决策能力，并集成到开源软件Raidionics中。

Abstract: Magnetic resonance (MR) imaging is essential for evaluating central nervous
system (CNS) tumors, guiding surgical planning, treatment decisions, and
assessing postoperative outcomes and complication risks. While recent work has
advanced automated tumor segmentation and report generation, most efforts have
focused on preoperative data, with limited attention to postoperative imaging
analysis. This study introduces a comprehensive pipeline for standardized
postsurtical reporting in CNS tumors. Using the Attention U-Net architecture,
segmentation models were trained for the preoperative (non-enhancing) tumor
core, postoperative contrast-enhancing residual tumor, and resection cavity.
Additionally, MR sequence classification and tumor type identification for
contrast-enhancing lesions were explored using the DenseNet architecture. The
models were integrated into a reporting pipeline, following the RANO 2.0
guidelines. Training was conducted on multicentric datasets comprising 2000 to
7000 patients, using a 5-fold cross-validation. Evaluation included patient-,
voxel-, and object-wise metrics, with benchmarking against the latest BraTS
challenge results. The segmentation models achieved average voxel-wise Dice
scores of 87%, 66%, 70%, and 77% for the tumor core, non-enhancing tumor core,
contrast-enhancing residual tumor, and resection cavity, respectively.
Classification models reached 99.5% balanced accuracy in MR sequence
classification and 80% in tumor type classification. The pipeline presented in
this study enables robust, automated segmentation, MR sequence classification,
and standardized report generation aligned with RANO 2.0 guidelines, enhancing
postoperative evaluation and clinical decision-making. The proposed models and
methods were integrated into Raidionics, open-source software platform for CNS
tumor analysis, now including a dedicated module for postsurgical analysis.

Abstract: LiDAR-based Place Recognition (LPR) remains a critical task in Embodied
Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Autonomous Driving, primarily addressing
localization challenges in GPS-denied environments and supporting loop closure
detection. Existing approaches reduce place recognition to a Euclidean
distance-based metric learning task, neglecting the feature space's intrinsic
structures and intra-class variances. Such Euclidean-centric formulation
inherently limits the model's capacity to capture nonlinear data distributions,
leading to suboptimal performance in complex environments and temporal-varying
scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose a novel cross-view network
based on an innovative fusion paradigm. Our framework introduces a
pseudo-global information guidance mechanism that coordinates multi-modal
branches to perform feature learning within a unified semantic space.
Concurrently, we propose a Manifold Adaptation and Pairwise Variance-Locality
Learning Metric that constructs a Symmetric Positive Definite (SPD) matrix to
compute Mahalanobis distance, superseding traditional Euclidean distance
metrics. This geometric formulation enables the model to accurately
characterize intrinsic data distributions and capture complex inter-class
dependencies within the feature space. Experimental results demonstrate that
the proposed algorithm achieves competitive performance, particularly excelling
in complex environmental conditions.

Abstract: Ultrasound (US) imaging is increasingly used in spinal procedures due to its
real-time, radiation-free capabilities; however, its effectiveness is hindered
by shadowing artifacts that obscure deeper tissue structures. Traditional
approaches, such as CT-to-US registration, incorporate anatomical information
from preoperative CT scans to guide interventions, but they are limited by
complex registration requirements, differences in spine curvature, and the need
for recent CT imaging. Recent shape completion methods can offer an alternative
by reconstructing spinal structures in US data, while being pretrained on large
set of publicly available CT scans. However, these approaches are typically
offline and have limited reproducibility. In this work, we introduce a novel
integrated system that combines robotic ultrasound with real-time shape
completion to enhance spinal visualization. Our robotic platform autonomously
acquires US sweeps of the lumbar spine, extracts vertebral surfaces from
ultrasound, and reconstructs the complete anatomy using a deep learning-based
shape completion network. This framework provides interactive, real-time
visualization with the capability to autonomously repeat scans and can enable
navigation to target locations. This can contribute to better consistency,
reproducibility, and understanding of the underlying anatomy. We validate our
approach through quantitative experiments assessing shape completion accuracy
and evaluations of multiple spine acquisition protocols on a phantom setup.
Additionally, we present qualitative results of the visualization on a
volunteer scan.

Result: 实验显示，稀疏训练将训练时间减少了63.7%，质量损失较小（PSNR下降0.59 dB，SSIM下降0.008），压缩率为14。

Conclusion: 该方法为体数据压缩提供了一种可扩展的无结构解决方案，适用于实际应用。

Abstract: Volumetric data compression is critical in fields like medical imaging,
scientific simulation, and entertainment. We introduce a structure-free neural
compression method combining Fourierfeature encoding with selective voxel
sampling, yielding compact volumetric representations and faster convergence.
Our dynamic voxel selection uses morphological dilation to prioritize active
regions, reducing redundant computation without any hierarchical metadata. In
the experiment, sparse training reduced training time by 63.7 % (from 30 to 11
minutes) with only minor quality loss: PSNR dropped 0.59 dB (from 32.60 to
32.01) and SSIM by 0.008 (from 0.948 to 0.940). The resulting neural
representation, stored solely as network weights, achieves a compression rate
of 14 and eliminates traditional data-loading overhead. This connects
coordinate-based neural representation with efficient volumetric compression,
offering a scalable, structure-free solution for practical applications.

Conclusion: 研究表明，通过提示工程直接利用基础模型的多模态知识，可在不微调的情况下实现高效的面部变形攻击检测。

Abstract: Face Morphing Attack Detection (MAD) is a critical challenge in face
recognition security, where attackers can fool systems by interpolating the
identity information of two or more individuals into a single face image,
resulting in samples that can be verified as belonging to multiple identities
by face recognition systems. While multimodal foundation models (FMs) like CLIP
offer strong zero-shot capabilities by jointly modeling images and text, most
prior works on FMs for biometric recognition have relied on fine-tuning for
specific downstream tasks, neglecting their potential for direct, generalizable
deployment. This work explores a pure zero-shot approach to MAD by leveraging
CLIP without any additional training or fine-tuning, focusing instead on the
design and aggregation of multiple textual prompts per class. By aggregating
the embeddings of diverse prompts, we better align the model's internal
representations with the MAD task, capturing richer and more varied cues
indicative of bona-fide or attack samples. Our results show that prompt
aggregation substantially improves zero-shot detection performance,
demonstrating the effectiveness of exploiting foundation models' built-in
multimodal knowledge through efficient prompt engineering.

Abstract: Skeleton-based action recognition (SAR) has achieved impressive progress with
transformer architectures. However, existing methods often rely on complex
module compositions and heavy designs, leading to increased parameter counts,
high computational costs, and limited scalability. In this paper, we propose a
unified spatio-temporal lightweight transformer framework that integrates
spatial and temporal modeling within a single attention module, eliminating the
need for separate temporal modeling blocks. This approach reduces redundant
computations while preserving temporal awareness within the spatial modeling
process. Furthermore, we introduce a simplified multi-scale pooling fusion
module that combines local and global pooling pathways to enhance the model's
ability to capture fine-grained local movements and overarching global motion
patterns. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our
lightweight model achieves a superior balance between accuracy and efficiency,
reducing parameter complexity by over 58% and lowering computational cost by
over 60% compared to state-of-the-art transformer-based baselines, while
maintaining competitive recognition performance.

Abstract: Storytelling tasks involving generating consistent subjects have gained
significant attention recently. However, existing methods, whether
training-free or training-based, continue to face challenges in maintaining
subject consistency due to the lack of fine-grained guidance and inter-frame
interaction. Additionally, the scarcity of high-quality data in this field
makes it difficult to precisely control storytelling tasks, including the
subject's position, appearance, clothing, expression, and posture, thereby
hindering further advancements. In this paper, we demonstrate that layout
conditions, such as the subject's position and detailed attributes, effectively
facilitate fine-grained interactions between frames. This not only strengthens
the consistency of the generated frame sequence but also allows for precise
control over the subject's position, appearance, and other key details.
Building on this, we introduce an advanced storytelling task: Layout-Togglable
Storytelling, which enables precise subject control by incorporating layout
conditions. To address the lack of high-quality datasets with layout
annotations for this task, we develop Lay2Story-1M, which contains over 1
million 720p and higher-resolution images, processed from approximately 11,300
hours of cartoon videos. Building on Lay2Story-1M, we create Lay2Story-Bench, a
benchmark with 3,000 prompts designed to evaluate the performance of different
methods on this task. Furthermore, we propose Lay2Story, a robust framework
based on the Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) architecture for Layout-Togglable
Storytelling tasks. Through both qualitative and quantitative experiments, we
find that our method outperforms the previous state-of-the-art (SOTA)
techniques, achieving the best results in terms of consistency, semantic
correlation, and aesthetic quality.

Result: 实验表明，TCSSM在多个域上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: TCSSM有效解决了CDVQA中的域偏移问题，BrightVQA数据集为未来研究提供了支持。

Abstract: The Earth's surface is constantly changing, and detecting these changes
provides valuable insights that benefit various aspects of human society. While
traditional change detection methods have been employed to detect changes from
bi-temporal images, these approaches typically require expert knowledge for
accurate interpretation. To enable broader and more flexible access to change
information by non-expert users, the task of Change Detection Visual Question
Answering (CDVQA) has been introduced. However, existing CDVQA methods have
been developed under the assumption that training and testing datasets share
similar distributions. This assumption does not hold in real-world
applications, where domain shifts often occur. In this paper, the CDVQA task is
revisited with a focus on addressing domain shift. To this end, a new
multi-modal and multi-domain dataset, BrightVQA, is introduced to facilitate
domain generalization research in CDVQA. Furthermore, a novel state space
model, termed Text-Conditioned State Space Model (TCSSM), is proposed. The
TCSSM framework is designed to leverage both bi-temporal imagery and
geo-disaster-related textual information in an unified manner to extract
domain-invariant features across domains. Input-dependent parameters existing
in TCSSM are dynamically predicted by using both bi-temporal images and
geo-disaster-related description, thereby facilitating the alignment between
bi-temporal visual data and the associated textual descriptions. Extensive
experiments are conducted to evaluate the proposed method against
state-of-the-art models, and superior performance is consistently demonstrated.
The code and dataset will be made publicly available upon acceptance at

Motivation: 现有缓存加速方法在跳过早期或中期去噪步骤时会导致结构差异，影响指令跟随和角色一致性。

Method: TaoCache采用固定点视角预测噪声输出，校准余弦相似度和范数比，保留高分辨率结构。

Result: 在多个数据集上，TaoCache在相同加速下显著提升了视觉质量（LPIPS、SSIM、PSNR）。

Conclusion: TaoCache是一种高效的缓存策略，适用于DiT框架，并能与其他加速方法互补。

Abstract: Existing cache-based acceleration methods for video diffusion models
primarily skip early or mid denoising steps, which often leads to structural
discrepancies relative to full-timestep generation and can hinder instruction
following and character consistency. We present TaoCache, a training-free,
plug-and-play caching strategy that, instead of residual-based caching, adopts
a fixed-point perspective to predict the model's noise output and is
specifically effective in late denoising stages. By calibrating cosine
similarities and norm ratios of consecutive noise deltas, TaoCache preserves
high-resolution structure while enabling aggressive skipping. The approach is
orthogonal to complementary accelerations such as Pyramid Attention Broadcast
(PAB) and TeaCache, and it integrates seamlessly into DiT-based frameworks.
Across Latte-1, OpenSora-Plan v110, and Wan2.1, TaoCache attains substantially
higher visual quality (LPIPS, SSIM, PSNR) than prior caching methods under the
same speedups.

Abstract: Colors play a crucial role in the design of vector graphic documents by
enhancing visual appeal, facilitating communication, improving usability, and
ensuring accessibility. In this context, color recommendation involves
suggesting appropriate colors to complete or refine a design when one or more
colors are missing or require alteration. Traditional methods often struggled
with these challenges due to the complex nature of color design and the limited
data availability. In this study, we explored the use of pretrained Large
Language Models (LLMs) and their commonsense reasoning capabilities for color
recommendation, raising the question: Can pretrained LLMs serve as superior
designers for color recommendation tasks? To investigate this, we developed a
robust, rigorously validated pipeline, ColorGPT, that was built by
systematically testing multiple color representations and applying effective
prompt engineering techniques. Our approach primarily targeted color palette
completion by recommending colors based on a set of given colors and
accompanying context. Moreover, our method can be extended to full palette
generation, producing an entire color palette corresponding to a provided
textual description. Experimental results demonstrated that our LLM-based
pipeline outperformed existing methods in terms of color suggestion accuracy
and the distribution of colors in the color palette completion task. For the
full palette generation task, our approach also yielded improvements in color
diversity and similarity compared to current techniques.

TL;DR: KFFocus提出了一种高效压缩视频令牌的方法，通过识别关键帧和动态调整压缩比例，提升视频LLMs的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频LLMs在压缩视频时忽略了关键帧的不均匀分布，导致信息丢失。

Method: 采用基于视频压缩原理的关键帧识别和动态压缩比例分配，结合时空建模模块。

Result: 在长视频场景中显著优于现有方法，提高了计算效率和准确性。

Conclusion: KFFocus通过优化视频令牌压缩和时空建模，有效提升了视频理解能力。

Abstract: Recently, with the emergence of large language models, multimodal LLMs have
demonstrated exceptional capabilities in image and video modalities. Despite
advancements in video comprehension, the substantial computational demands of
long video sequences lead current video LLMs (Vid-LLMs) to employ compression
strategies at both the inter-frame level (e.g., uniform sampling of video
frames) and intra-frame level (e.g., condensing all visual tokens of each frame
into a limited number). However, this approach often neglects the uneven
temporal distribution of critical information across frames, risking the
omission of keyframes that contain essential temporal and semantic details. To
tackle these challenges, we propose KFFocus, a method designed to efficiently
compress video tokens and emphasize the informative context present within
video frames. We substitute uniform sampling with a refined approach inspired
by classic video compression principles to identify and capture keyframes based
on their temporal redundancy. By assigning varying condensation ratios to
frames based on their contextual relevance, KFFocus efficiently reduces token
redundancy while preserving informative content details. Additionally, we
introduce a spatiotemporal modeling module that encodes both the temporal
relationships between video frames and the spatial structure within each frame,
thus providing Vid-LLMs with a nuanced understanding of spatial-temporal
dynamics. Extensive experiments on widely recognized video understanding
benchmarks, especially long video scenarios, demonstrate that KFFocus
significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving substantial computational
efficiency and enhanced accuracy.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为MSQ的多尺度量化方法，用于解决当前运动生成中多尺度捕捉不足和组合灵活性差的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的运动表示方法无法从多尺度捕捉运动，且缺乏组合灵活性，限制了复杂模式建模和多样化生成任务的能力。

Method: MSQ通过空间和时间维度的多尺度离散标记压缩运动序列，并使用不同编码器捕捉不同空间粒度的身体部分，再通过时间插值和量化生成离散标记。

Result: 实验表明，MSQ无需专门设计或重新训练即可无缝组合运动标记，并在多个基准测试中优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MSQ为运动生成提供了一种高效且灵活的多尺度表示方法，支持运动编辑、控制和条件生成。

Abstract: Despite significant advancements in human motion generation, current motion
representations, typically formulated as discrete frame sequences, still face
two critical limitations: (i) they fail to capture motion from a multi-scale
perspective, limiting the capability in complex patterns modeling; (ii) they
lack compositional flexibility, which is crucial for model's generalization in
diverse generation tasks. To address these challenges, we introduce MSQ, a
novel quantization method that compresses the motion sequence into multi-scale
discrete tokens across spatial and temporal dimensions. MSQ employs distinct
encoders to capture body parts at varying spatial granularities and temporally
interpolates the encoded features into multiple scales before quantizing them
into discrete tokens. Building on this representation, we establish a
generative mask modeling model to effectively support motion editing, motion
control, and conditional motion generation. Through quantitative and
qualitative analysis, we show that our quantization method enables the seamless
composition of motion tokens without requiring specialized design or
re-training. Furthermore, extensive evaluations demonstrate that our approach
outperforms existing baseline methods on various benchmarks.

Method: 通过组合小核（如7×7、9×9、11×11）扩展ERF，设计Three-layer Receptive Field Aggregator和Layer Operator，构建UniConvNet模型。

Result: UniConvNet在ImageNet-1K、COCO2017和ADE20K上优于现有CNN和ViT模型。UniConvNet-T达到84.2%的ImageNet top-1准确率，UniConvNet-XL达到88.4%。

Conclusion: 论文提出的方法在扩展ERF的同时保持AGD，显著提升了模型性能，适用于不同规模的ConvNet。

Abstract: Convolutional neural networks (ConvNets) with large effective receptive field
(ERF), still in their early stages, have demonstrated promising effectiveness
while constrained by high parameters and FLOPs costs and disrupted
asymptotically Gaussian distribution (AGD) of ERF. This paper proposes an
alternative paradigm: rather than merely employing extremely large ERF, it is
more effective and efficient to expand the ERF while maintaining AGD of ERF by
proper combination of smaller kernels, such as $7\times{7}$, $9\times{9}$,
$11\times{11}$. This paper introduces a Three-layer Receptive Field Aggregator
and designs a Layer Operator as the fundamental operator from the perspective
of receptive field. The ERF can be expanded to the level of existing
large-kernel ConvNets through the stack of proposed modules while maintaining
AGD of ERF. Using these designs, we propose a universal model for ConvNet of
any scale, termed UniConvNet. Extensive experiments on ImageNet-1K, COCO2017,
and ADE20K demonstrate that UniConvNet outperforms state-of-the-art CNNs and
ViTs across various vision recognition tasks for both lightweight and
large-scale models with comparable throughput. Surprisingly, UniConvNet-T
achieves $84.2\%$ ImageNet top-1 accuracy with $30M$ parameters and $5.1G$
FLOPs. UniConvNet-XL also shows competitive scalability to big data and large
models, acquiring $88.4\%$ top-1 accuracy on ImageNet. Code and models are

Result: 在三个低光数据集上的实验表明，该方法在质量和定量指标上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 减少ICR能显著提升低光图像增强效果，IRetinex模型为此提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: In low-light image enhancement, Retinex-based deep learning methods have
garnered significant attention due to their exceptional interpretability. These
methods decompose images into mutually independent illumination and reflectance
components, allows each component to be enhanced separately. In fact, achieving
perfect decomposition of illumination and reflectance components proves to be
quite challenging, with some residuals still existing after decomposition. In
this paper, we formally name these residuals as inter-component residuals
(ICR), which has been largely underestimated by previous methods. In our
investigation, ICR not only affects the accuracy of the decomposition but also
causes enhanced components to deviate from the ideal outcome, ultimately
reducing the final synthesized image quality. To address this issue, we propose
a novel Inter-correction Retinex model (IRetinex) to alleviate ICR during the
decomposition and enhancement stage. In the decomposition stage, we leverage
inter-component residual reduction module to reduce the feature similarity
between illumination and reflectance components. In the enhancement stage, we
utilize the feature similarity between the two components to detect and
mitigate the impact of ICR within each enhancement unit. Extensive experiments
on three low-light benchmark datasets demonstrated that by reducing ICR, our
method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches both qualitatively and
quantitatively.

Motivation: 现有半监督学习方法依赖学生模型且忽略认知偏差，生成高置信度伪标签的挑战较大。

Method: 采用两个子网络，提出交叉子网一致性保持策略（CCP）和不确定性感知伪标签生成（UPG）。

Result: 在多种医学图像模态上验证，UC-Seg在分割准确性和泛化性能上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: UC-Seg通过减少认知偏差和生成高质量伪标签，提升了半监督医学图像分割的性能。

Abstract: Semi-supervised learning has gained considerable popularity in medical image
segmentation tasks due to its capability to reduce reliance on expert-examined
annotations. Several mean-teacher (MT) based semi-supervised methods utilize
consistency regularization to effectively leverage valuable information from
unlabeled data. However, these methods often heavily rely on the student model
and overlook the potential impact of cognitive biases within the model.
Furthermore, some methods employ co-training using pseudo-labels derived from
different inputs, yet generating high-confidence pseudo-labels from perturbed
inputs during training remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we
propose an Uncertainty-aware Cross-training framework for semi-supervised
medical image Segmentation (UC-Seg). Our UC-Seg framework incorporates two
distinct subnets to effectively explore and leverage the correlation between
them, thereby mitigating cognitive biases within the model. Specifically, we
present a Cross-subnet Consistency Preservation (CCP) strategy to enhance
feature representation capability and ensure feature consistency across the two
subnets. This strategy enables each subnet to correct its own biases and learn
shared semantics from both labeled and unlabeled data. Additionally, we propose
an Uncertainty-aware Pseudo-label Generation (UPG) component that leverages
segmentation results and corresponding uncertainty maps from both subnets to
generate high-confidence pseudo-labels. We extensively evaluate the proposed
UC-Seg on various medical image segmentation tasks involving different modality
images, such as MRI, CT, ultrasound, colonoscopy, and so on. The results
demonstrate that our method achieves superior segmentation accuracy and
generalization performance compared to other state-of-the-art semi-supervised
methods. Our code will be released at https://github.com/taozh2017/UCSeg.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI生成内容越来越逼真，人工标注变得耗时且不可靠，需要一种能有效利用大规模未标注数据的方法。

Method: DPGNet包含文本引导的跨域对齐和课程驱动的伪标签生成两个核心模块，并通过跨域知识蒸馏防止灾难性遗忘。

Result: 在11个流行数据集上的实验表明，DPGNet性能优于现有方法6.3%。

Conclusion: DPGNet通过利用未标注数据，有效解决了深度伪造检测中的标注挑战。

Abstract: Existing deepfake detection methods heavily depend on labeled training data.
However, as AI-generated content becomes increasingly realistic, even
\textbf{human annotators struggle to distinguish} between deepfakes and
authentic images. This makes the labeling process both time-consuming and less
reliable. Specifically, there is a growing demand for approaches that can
effectively utilize large-scale unlabeled data from online social networks.
Unlike typical unsupervised learning tasks, where categories are distinct,
AI-generated faces closely mimic real image distributions and share strong
similarities, causing performance drop in conventional strategies. In this
paper, we introduce the Dual-Path Guidance Network (DPGNet), to tackle two key
challenges: (1) bridging the domain gap between faces from different generation
models, and (2) utilizing unlabeled image samples. The method features two core
modules: text-guided cross-domain alignment, which uses learnable prompts to
unify visual and textual embeddings into a domain-invariant feature space, and
curriculum-driven pseudo label generation, which dynamically exploit more
informative unlabeled samples. To prevent catastrophic forgetting, we also
facilitate bridging between domains via cross-domain knowledge distillation.
Extensive experiments on \textbf{11 popular datasets}, show that DPGNet
outperforms SoTA approaches by \textbf{6.3\%}, highlighting its effectiveness
in leveraging unlabeled data to address the annotation challenges posed by the
increasing realism of deepfakes.

Conclusion: 该方法高效且适用于数据收集困难的现实应用。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
predicting agent movements within virtual environments and real-world scenarios
based on visual observations and textual instructions. Although recent research
has focused on enhancing spatial and temporal understanding independently, this
paper presents a novel approach that integrates both aspects through visual
prompting. We introduce a method that projects visual traces of key points from
observations onto depth maps, enabling models to capture both spatial and
temporal information simultaneously. The experiments in SimplerEnv show that
the mean number of tasks successfully solved increased for 4% compared to
SpatialVLA and 19% compared to TraceVLA. Furthermore, we show that this
enhancement can be achieved with minimal training data, making it particularly
valuable for real-world applications where data collection is challenging. The

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了文本到图像个性化任务的效果，为概念学习提供了新思路。

Abstract: Visual concept learning, also known as Text-to-image personalization, is the
process of teaching new concepts to a pretrained model. This has numerous
applications from product placement to entertainment and personalized design.
Here we show that many existing methods can be substantially augmented by
adding a personalization step that is (1) specific to the prompt and noise
seed, and (2) using two loss terms based on the self- and cross- attention,
capturing the identity of the personalized concept. Specifically, we leverage
PDM features -- previously designed to capture identity -- and show how they
can be used to improve personalized semantic similarity. We evaluate the
benefit that our method gains on top of six different personalization methods,
and several base text-to-image models (both UNet- and DiT-based). We find
significant improvements even over previous per-query personalization methods.

Result: 实验显示，该方法在模拟真实场景中EBI达到68.91，显著提升检测效果。

Conclusion: 该方法有效提升了视频异常检测在动态环境中的适用性和准确性。

Abstract: Video Anomaly Detection (VAD) can play a key role in spotting unusual
activities in video footage. VAD is difficult to use in real-world settings due
to the dynamic nature of human actions, environmental variations, and domain
shifts. Traditional evaluation metrics often prove inadequate for such
scenarios, as they rely on static assumptions and fall short of identifying a
threshold that distinguishes normal from anomalous behavior in dynamic
settings. To address this, we introduce an active learning framework tailored
for VAD, designed for adapting to the ever-changing real-world conditions. Our
approach leverages active learning to continuously select the most informative
data points for labeling, thereby enhancing model adaptability. A critical
innovation is the incorporation of a human-in-the-loop mechanism, which enables
the identification of actual normal and anomalous instances from
pseudo-labeling results generated by AI. This collected data allows the
framework to define an adaptive threshold tailored to different environments,
ensuring that the system remains effective as the definition of 'normal' shifts
across various settings. Implemented within a lab-based framework that
simulates real-world conditions, our approach allows rigorous testing and
refinement of VAD algorithms with a new metric. Experimental results show that
our method achieves an EBI (Error Balance Index) of 68.91 for Q3 in real-world
simulated scenarios, demonstrating its practical effectiveness and
significantly enhancing the applicability of VAD in dynamic environments.

Motivation: 解决自动驾驶系统中开放集感知的挑战，特别是识别未见过的物体类别，以确保安全性。

Method: 提出VLM-3D框架，结合LoRA高效适应VLMs，并设计联合语义-几何损失（早期使用语义损失，后期引入3D IoU损失）。

Result: 在nuScenes数据集上，VLM-3D的感知精度提升了12.8%。

Conclusion: VLM-3D通过端到端设计和联合损失，显著提升了自动驾驶场景中的3D感知能力。

Abstract: Open-set perception in complex traffic environments poses a critical
challenge for autonomous driving systems, particularly in identifying
previously unseen object categories, which is vital for ensuring safety. Visual
Language Models (VLMs), with their rich world knowledge and strong semantic
reasoning capabilities, offer new possibilities for addressing this task.
However, existing approaches typically leverage VLMs to extract visual features
and couple them with traditional object detectors, resulting in multi-stage
error propagation that hinders perception accuracy. To overcome this
limitation, we propose VLM-3D, the first end-to-end framework that enables VLMs
to perform 3D geometric perception in autonomous driving scenarios. VLM-3D
incorporates Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to efficiently adapt VLMs to driving
tasks with minimal computational overhead, and introduces a joint
semantic-geometric loss design: token-level semantic loss is applied during
early training to ensure stable convergence, while 3D IoU loss is introduced in
later stages to refine the accuracy of 3D bounding box predictions. Evaluations
on the nuScenes dataset demonstrate that the proposed joint semantic-geometric
loss in VLM-3D leads to a 12.8% improvement in perception accuracy, fully
validating the effectiveness and advancement of our method.

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) highlight a strong connection
between intelligence and compression. Learned image compression, a fundamental
task in modern data compression, has made significant progress in recent years.
However, current models remain limited in scale, restricting their
representation capacity, and how scaling model size influences compression
performance remains unexplored. In this work, we present a pioneering study on
scaling up learned image compression models and revealing the performance
trends through scaling laws. Using the recent state-of-the-art HPCM model as
baseline, we scale model parameters from 68.5 millions to 1 billion and fit
power-law relations between test loss and key scaling variables, including
model size and optimal training compute. The results reveal a scaling trend,
enabling extrapolation to larger scale models. Experimental results demonstrate
that the scaled-up HPCM-1B model achieves state-of-the-art rate-distortion
performance. We hope this work inspires future exploration of large-scale
compression models and deeper investigations into the connection between
compression and intelligence.

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable success on multimodal
tasks such as image-text retrieval and zero-shot classification, yet they can
exhibit demographic biases even when explicit protected attributes are absent
during training. In this work, we focus on automated glaucoma screening from
retinal fundus images, a critical application given that glaucoma is a leading
cause of irreversible blindness and disproportionately affects underserved
populations. Building on a reweighting-based contrastive learning framework, we
introduce an attribute-agnostic debiasing method that (i) infers proxy
subgroups via unsupervised clustering of image-image embeddings, (ii) computes
gradient-similarity weights between the CLIP-style multimodal loss and a
SimCLR-style image-pair contrastive loss, and (iii) applies these weights in a
joint, top-$k$ weighted objective to upweight underperforming clusters. This
label-free approach adaptively targets the hardest examples, thereby reducing
subgroup disparities. We evaluate our method on the Harvard FairVLMed glaucoma
subset, reporting Equalized Odds Distance (EOD), Equalized Subgroup AUC (ES
AUC), and Groupwise AUC to demonstrate equitable performance across inferred
demographic subgroups.

Abstract: In the rapidly evolving landscape of digital security, biometric
authentication systems, particularly facial recognition, have emerged as
integral components of various security protocols. However, the reliability of
these systems is compromised by sophisticated spoofing attacks, where imposters
gain unauthorized access by falsifying biometric traits. Current literature
reveals a concerning gap: existing liveness detection methodologies - designed
to counteract these breaches - fall short against advanced spoofing tactics
employing deepfakes and other artificial intelligence-driven manipulations.
This study introduces a robust solution through novel deep learning models
addressing the deficiencies in contemporary anti-spoofing techniques. By
innovatively integrating texture analysis and reflective properties associated
with genuine human traits, our models distinguish authentic presence from
replicas with remarkable precision. Extensive evaluations were conducted across
five diverse datasets, encompassing a wide range of attack vectors and
environmental conditions. Results demonstrate substantial advancement over
existing systems, with our best model (AttackNet V2.2) achieving 99.9% average
accuracy when trained on combined data. Moreover, our research unveils critical
insights into the behavioral patterns of impostor attacks, contributing to a
more nuanced understanding of their evolving nature. The implications are
profound: our models do not merely fortify the authentication processes but
also instill confidence in biometric systems across various sectors reliant on
secure access.

Conclusion: Turbo-VAED首次实现移动设备上实时720p视频VAE解码，适用于大多数视频VAE，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: There is a growing demand for deploying large generative AI models on mobile
devices. For recent popular video generative models, however, the Variational
AutoEncoder (VAE) represents one of the major computational bottlenecks. Both
large parameter sizes and mismatched kernels cause out-of-memory errors or
extremely slow inference on mobile devices. To address this, we propose a
low-cost solution that efficiently transfers widely used video VAEs to mobile
devices. (1) We analyze redundancy in existing VAE architectures and get
empirical design insights. By integrating 3D depthwise separable convolutions
into our model, we significantly reduce the number of parameters. (2) We
observe that the upsampling techniques in mainstream video VAEs are poorly
suited to mobile hardware and form the main bottleneck. In response, we propose
a decoupled 3D pixel shuffle scheme that slashes end-to-end delay. Building
upon these, we develop a universal mobile-oriented VAE decoder, Turbo-VAED. (3)
We propose an efficient VAE decoder training method. Since only the decoder is
used during deployment, we distill it to Turbo-VAED instead of retraining the
full VAE, enabling fast mobile adaptation with minimal performance loss. To our
knowledge, our method enables real-time 720p video VAE decoding on mobile
devices for the first time. This approach is widely applicable to most video
VAEs. When integrated into four representative models, with training cost as
low as $95, it accelerates original VAEs by up to 84.5x at 720p resolution on
GPUs, uses as low as 17.5% of original parameter count, and retains 96.9% of
the original reconstruction quality. Compared to mobile-optimized VAEs,
Turbo-VAED achieves a 2.9x speedup in FPS and better reconstruction quality on
the iPhone 16 Pro. The code and models will soon be available at
https://github.com/hustvl/Turbo-VAED.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于缺乏公开的高质量全身人体捕捉数据集，数字人体表示的重光照和新视角渲染研究进展受限。

Method: 提出HumanOLAT数据集，包含多种光照条件下的HDR RGB帧，如白光、环境贴图、颜色梯度和细粒度OLAT光照。

Result: 评估现有重光照和新视角合成方法，突显数据集的实用性和建模复杂人体外观与光照交互的挑战。

Conclusion: HumanOLAT将推动未来研究，支持严格基准测试和重光照与渲染技术的进步。

Abstract: Simultaneous relighting and novel-view rendering of digital human
representations is an important yet challenging task with numerous
applications. Progress in this area has been significantly limited due to the
lack of publicly available, high-quality datasets, especially for full-body
human captures. To address this critical gap, we introduce the HumanOLAT
dataset, the first publicly accessible large-scale dataset of multi-view
One-Light-at-a-Time (OLAT) captures of full-body humans. The dataset includes
HDR RGB frames under various illuminations, such as white light, environment
maps, color gradients and fine-grained OLAT illuminations. Our evaluations of
state-of-the-art relighting and novel-view synthesis methods underscore both
the dataset's value and the significant challenges still present in modeling
complex human-centric appearance and lighting interactions. We believe
HumanOLAT will significantly facilitate future research, enabling rigorous
benchmarking and advancements in both general and human-specific relighting and
rendering techniques.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前数字基础设施的过度使用和资源消耗加剧了气候变化和生态边界的不确定性，需要寻找一种可持续的替代方案。

Method: 提出了一种基于废弃电子设备（WEEE）的IT架构，依赖可再生能源和开源软件，具有自主性、鲁棒性和适应性。

Result: 该架构为减少数字技术对环境的影响提供了一种节俭的解决方案，并适应未来技术使用的下降。

Conclusion: 通过采用这种架构，可以逐步减少对数字技术的依赖，避免对生态系统的不可逆破坏。

Abstract: Crossing multiple planetary boundaries places us in a zone of uncertainty
that is characterized by considerable fluctuations in climatic events. The
situation is exacerbated by the relentless use of resources and energy required
to develop digital infrastructures that have become pervasive and ubiquitous.
We are bound to these infrastructures, dead technologies and negative commons,
just as much as they bind us. Although their growth threatens the necessary
reduction of our impact, we have a responsibility to maintain them until we can
do without them.
  In university setting, as well as in any public organization, urban mines per
se, we propose an IT architecture based on the exclusive use of unreliable
waste from electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) as a frugal alternative
to the incessant replacement of devices. Powered by renewable energy,
autonomous, robust, adaptable, and built on battle-tested open-source software,
we envision this solution for a situation where use is bound to decline
eventually, to close this damaging technological chapter. Digital technology,
the idol of modern times, is to meet its twilight if we do not want to
irrevocably alter the critical zone.

Motivation: 填补生成式AI在真实教育环境中题目心理测量质量评估的空白，探索其在高效测试设计中的作用。

Method: 采用迭代优化策略，通过LLM生成、评估和改进题目，并在91个班级（近1700名学生）中进行大规模实地研究，使用项目反应理论（IRT）分析。

Result: AI生成的题目在学生样本中表现与专家设计的标准化题目相当。

Conclusion: AI能够高效生成高质量评估题目，为教师和学生提供便利。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) challenge conventional methods of teaching
and learning, they present an exciting opportunity to improve efficiency and
scale high-quality instruction. One promising application is the generation of
customized exams, tailored to specific course content. There has been
significant recent excitement on automatically generating questions using
artificial intelligence, but also comparatively little work evaluating the
psychometric quality of these items in real-world educational settings. Filling
this gap is an important step toward understanding generative AI's role in
effective test design. In this study, we introduce and evaluate an iterative
refinement strategy for question generation, repeatedly producing, assessing,
and improving questions through cycles of LLM-generated critique and revision.
We evaluate the quality of these AI-generated questions in a large-scale field
study involving 91 classes -- covering computer science, mathematics,
chemistry, and more -- in dozens of colleges across the United States,
comprising nearly 1700 students. Our analysis, based on item response theory
(IRT), suggests that for students in our sample the AI-generated questions
performed comparably to expert-created questions designed for standardized
exams. Our results illustrate the power of AI to make high-quality assessments
more readily available, benefiting both teachers and students.

Abstract: With the increasing adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in all fields
and daily activities, a heated debate is found about the advantages and
challenges of AI and the need for navigating the concerns associated with AI to
make the best of it. To contribute to this literature and the ongoing debate
related to it, this study draws on the Monster theory to explain the
conflicting representation of AI. It suggests that studying monsters in popular
culture can provide an in-depth understanding of AI and its monstrous effects.
Specifically, this study aims to discuss AI perception and development through
the seven theses of Monster theory. The obtained results revealed that, just
like monsters, AI is complex in nature, and it should not be studied as a
separate entity but rather within a given society or culture. Similarly,
readers may perceive and interpret AI differently, just as readers may
interpret monsters differently. The relationship between AI and monsters, as
depicted in this study, does not seem to be as odd as it might be at first.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于多元伦理观点的道德推理系统框架，结合深度反思与实时响应，支持复杂道德情境下的决策。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在解决机器伦理中的道德复杂性，通过透明和原则化的方式实现价值对齐，支持高风险的现实决策。

Method: 采用双层次混合架构，包括通用层定义道德阈值，局部层学习上下文权衡，结合多元伦理内容。

Result: 系统能够处理多因素困境、多方利益相关者及非道德因素的整合，支持道德决策。

Conclusion: 该框架为机器伦理和价值对齐提供了新思路，适用于高风险现实场景。

Abstract: The conceptual framework proposed in this paper centers on the development of
a deliberative moral reasoning system - one designed to process complex moral
situations by generating, filtering, and weighing normative arguments drawn
from diverse ethical perspectives. While the framework is rooted in Machine
Ethics, it also makes a substantive contribution to Value Alignment by
outlining a system architecture that links structured moral reasoning to action
under time constraints. Grounded in normative moral pluralism, this system is
not constructed to imitate behavior but is built on reason-sensitive
deliberation over structured moral content in a transparent and principled
manner. Beyond its role as a deliberative system, it also serves as the
conceptual foundation for a novel two-level architecture: functioning as a
moral reasoning teacher envisioned to train faster models that support
real-time responsiveness without reproducing the full structure of deliberative
reasoning. Together, the deliberative and intuitive components are designed to
enable both deep reflection and responsive action. A key design feature is the
dual-hybrid structure: a universal layer that defines a moral threshold through
top-down and bottom-up learning, and a local layer that learns to weigh
competing considerations in context while integrating culturally specific
normative content, so long as it remains within the universal threshold. By
extending the notion of moral complexity to include not only conflicting
beliefs but also multifactorial dilemmas, multiple stakeholders, and the
integration of non-moral considerations, the framework aims to support morally
grounded decision-making in realistic, high-stakes contexts.

Motivation: 现有算法公平性研究主要关注敏感属性，忽视了社会决定因素的作用，导致对公平性的理解不全面。

Method: 采用基于区域的分析方法，利用Gamma分布参数化建模社会决定因素对个体结果的影响。

Result: 研究发现仅关注敏感属性的缓解策略可能引入新的结构性不公，而结合社会决定因素能更全面地理解公平性。

Conclusion: 综合考虑敏感属性和社会决定因素是实现有效和透明公平的关键。

Abstract: Social determinants are variables that, while not directly pertaining to any
specific individual, capture key aspects of contexts and environments that have
direct causal influences on certain attributes of an individual. Previous
algorithmic fairness literature has primarily focused on sensitive attributes,
often overlooking the role of social determinants. Our paper addresses this gap
by introducing formal and quantitative rigor into a space that has been shaped
largely by qualitative proposals regarding the use of social determinants. To
demonstrate theoretical perspectives and practical applicability, we examine a
concrete setting of college admissions, using region as a proxy for social
determinants. Our approach leverages a region-based analysis with Gamma
distribution parameterization to model how social determinants impact
individual outcomes. Despite its simplicity, our method quantitatively recovers
findings that resonate with nuanced insights in previous qualitative debates,
that are often missed by existing algorithmic fairness approaches. Our findings
suggest that mitigation strategies centering solely around sensitive attributes
may introduce new structural injustice when addressing existing discrimination.
Considering both sensitive attributes and social determinants facilitates a
more comprehensive explication of benefits and burdens experienced by
individuals from diverse demographic backgrounds as well as contextual
environments, which is essential for understanding and achieving fairness
effectively and transparently.

Motivation: 研究动机是评估AI公司如何履行其对白宫的自愿承诺，以揭示当前AI治理的不足。

Method: 通过制定详细评分标准，基于公司公开披露的行为对16家公司进行评分。

Result: 结果显示公司表现差异显著，平均分52%，模型权重安全承诺平均仅17%。

Conclusion: 结论指出未来AI治理需加强透明度和可验证性，并提出了三条具体建议。

Abstract: Voluntary commitments are central to international AI governance, as
demonstrated by recent voluntary guidelines from the White House to the G7,
from Bletchley Park to Seoul. How do major AI companies make good on their
commitments? We score companies based on their publicly disclosed behavior by
developing a detailed rubric based on their eight voluntary commitments to the
White House in 2023. We find significant heterogeneity: while the
highest-scoring company (OpenAI) scores a 83% overall on our rubric, the
average score across all companies is just 52%. The companies demonstrate
systemically poor performance for their commitment to model weight security
with an average score of 17%: 11 of the 16 companies receive 0% for this
commitment. Our analysis highlights a clear structural shortcoming that future
AI governance initiatives should correct: when companies make public
commitments, they should proactively disclose how they meet their commitments
to provide accountability, and these disclosures should be verifiable. To
advance policymaking on corporate AI governance, we provide three directed
recommendations that address underspecified commitments, the role of complex AI
supply chains, and public transparency that could be applied towards AI
governance initiatives worldwide.

Result: 合成数据可能匿名，但识别风险取决于特定因素，需明确法规。

Conclusion: 呼吁更清晰的法规以促进AI在医疗领域的创新，同时保护隐私。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to transform healthcare, but
it requires access to health data. Synthetic data that is generated through
machine learning models trained on real data, offers a way to share data while
preserving privacy. However, uncertainties in the practical application of the
General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) create an administrative burden,
limiting the benefits of synthetic data. Through a systematic analysis of
relevant legal sources and an empirical study, this article explores whether
synthetic data should be classified as personal data under the GDPR. The study
investigates the residual identification risk through generating synthetic data
and simulating inference attacks, challenging common perceptions of technical
identification risk. The findings suggest synthetic data is likely anonymous,
depending on certain factors, but highlights uncertainties about what
constitutes reasonably likely risk. To promote innovation, the study calls for
clearer regulations to balance privacy protection with the advancement of AI in
healthcare.

Conclusion: 该框架能够有效提升LLM应用的准确性、全面性和可验证性。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have the potential to address social and
behavioral determinants of health by transforming labor intensive workflows in
resource-constrained settings. Creating LLM-based applications that serve the
needs of underserved communities requires a deep understanding of their local
context, but it is often the case that neither LLMs nor their developers
possess this local expertise, and the experts in these communities often face
severe time/resource constraints. This creates a disconnect: how can one engage
in meaningful co-design of an LLM-based application for an under-resourced
community when the communication channel between the LLM developer and domain
expert is constrained? We explored this question through a real-world case
study, in which our data science team sought to partner with social workers at
a safety net hospital to build an LLM application that summarizes patients'
social needs. Whereas prior works focus on the challenge of prompt tuning, we
found that the most critical challenge in this setting is the careful and
precise specification of \what information to surface to providers so that the
LLM application is accurate, comprehensive, and verifiable. Here we present a
novel co-design framework for settings with limited access to domain experts,
in which the summary generation task is first decomposed into
individually-optimizable attributes and then each attribute is efficiently
refined and validated through a multi-tier cascading approach.

Conclusion: 为负责任AI代理的开发与部署指明了方向，强调需填补法律理论与技术实践之间的鸿沟。

Abstract: As AI becomes more "agentic," it faces technical and socio-legal issues it
must address if it is to fulfill its promise of increased economic productivity
and efficiency. This paper uses technical and legal perspectives to explain how
things change when AI systems start being able to directly execute tasks on
behalf of a user. We show how technical conceptions of agents track some, but
not all, socio-legal conceptions of agency. That is, both computer science and
the law recognize the problems of under-specification for an agent, and both
disciplines have robust conceptions of how to address ensuring an agent does
what the programmer, or in the law, the principal desires and no more. However,
to date, computer science has under-theorized issues related to questions of
loyalty and to third parties that interact with an agent, both of which are
central parts of the law of agency. First, we examine the correlations between
implied authority in agency law and the principle of value-alignment in AI,
wherein AI systems must operate under imperfect objective specification.
Second, we reveal gaps in the current computer science view of agents
pertaining to the legal concepts of disclosure and loyalty, and how failure to
account for them can result in unintended effects in AI ecommerce agents. In
surfacing these gaps, we show a path forward for responsible AI agent
development and deployment.

Conclusion: 结论指出，分歧源于部署成本的来源及风险集中度的观察与建模差异，研究为AI在特定应用和地理环境中的社会服务提供了指导。

Abstract: AI-powered scarce resource allocation policies rely on predictions to target
either specific individuals (e.g., high-risk) or settings (e.g.,
neighborhoods). Recent research on individual-level targeting demonstrates
conflicting results; some models show that targeting is not useful when
inequality is high, while other work demonstrates potential benefits. To study
and reconcile this apparent discrepancy, we develop a stylized framework based
on the Mallows model to understand how the spatial distribution of inequality
affects the effectiveness of door-to-door outreach policies. We introduce the
RENT (Relative Efficiency of Non-Targeting) metric, which we use to assess the
effectiveness of targeting approaches compared with neighborhood-based
approaches in preventing tenant eviction when high-risk households are more
versus less spatially concentrated. We then calibrate the model parameters to
eviction court records collected in a medium-sized city in the USA. Results
demonstrate considerable gains in the number of high-risk households canvassed
through individually targeted policies, even in a highly segregated metro area
with concentrated risks of eviction. We conclude that apparent discrepancies in
the prior literature can be reconciled by considering 1) the source of
deployment costs and 2) the observed versus modeled concentrations of risk. Our
results inform the deployment of AI-based solutions in social service provision
that account for particular applications and geographies.

Abstract: Due to perceptions of efficiency and significant productivity gains, various
organisations, including in education, are adopting Large Language Models
(LLMs) into their workflows. Educator-facing, learner-facing, and
institution-facing LLMs, collectively, Educational Large Language Models
(eLLMs), complement and enhance the effectiveness of teaching, learning, and
academic operations. However, their integration into an educational setting
raises significant cybersecurity concerns. A comprehensive landscape of
contemporary attacks on LLMs and their impact on the educational environment is
missing. This study presents a generalised taxonomy of fifty attacks on LLMs,
which are categorized as attacks targeting either models or their
infrastructure. The severity of these attacks is evaluated in the educational
sector using the DREAD risk assessment framework. Our risk assessment indicates
that token smuggling, adversarial prompts, direct injection, and multi-step
jailbreak are critical attacks on eLLMs. The proposed taxonomy, its application
in the educational environment, and our risk assessment will help academic and
industrial practitioners to build resilient solutions that protect learners and
institutions.

Abstract: Computational social experiments, which typically employ agent-based modeling
to create testbeds for piloting social experiments, not only provide a
computational solution to the major challenges faced by traditional
experimental methods, but have also gained widespread attention in various
research fields. Despite their significance, their broader impact is largely
limited by the underdeveloped intelligence of their core component, i.e.,
agents. To address this limitation, we develop a framework grounded in
well-established social science theories and practices, consisting of three key
elements: (i) large language model (LLM)-driven experimental agents, serving as
"silicon participants", (ii) methods for implementing various interventions or
treatments, and (iii) tools for collecting behavioral, survey, and interview
data. We evaluate its effectiveness by replicating three representative
experiments, with results demonstrating strong alignment, both quantitatively
and qualitatively, with real-world evidence. This work provides the first
framework for designing LLM-driven agents to pilot social experiments,
underscoring the transformative potential of LLMs and their agents in
computational social science

Conclusion: 论文呼吁建立社会主张的问责机制，以缩小主张-现实差距。

Abstract: Many Machine Learning research studies use language that describes potential
social benefits or technical affordances of new methods and technologies. Such
language, which we call "social claims", can help garner substantial resources
and influence for those involved in ML research and technology production.
However, there exists a gap between social claims and reality (the
claim-reality gap): ML methods often fail to deliver the claimed functionality
or social impacts. This paper investigates the claim-reality gap and makes a
normative argument for developing accountability mechanisms for it. In making
the argument, we make three contributions. First, we show why the symptom -
absence of social claim accountability - is problematic. Second, we coin dead
zone of accountability - a lens that scholars and practitioners can use to
identify opportunities for new forms of accountability. We apply this lens to
the claim-reality gap and provide a diagnosis by identifying cognitive and
structural resistances to accountability in the claim-reality gap. Finally, we
offer a prescription - two potential collaborative research agendas that can
help create the condition for social claim accountability.

### [88] [Urban-STA4CLC: Urban Theory-Informed Spatio-Temporal Attention Model for Predicting Post-Disaster Commercial Land Use Change](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08976)
*Ziyi Guo,Yan Wang*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种基于城市理论的时空注意力模型（Urban-STA4CLC），用于预测自然灾害后商业土地利用的变化，模型性能显著优于非理论基线。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自然灾害对经济活动的影响日益显著，尤其是商业土地利用的变化，但现有模型难以捕捉这种复杂互动。

Method: 结合城市理论（韧性理论、空间经济理论和扩散理论），设计了时空注意力模型，包含三个理论指导模块。

Result: 模型在预测飓风频发情景下的商业土地利用变化时，F1分数提高了约19%（0.8763）。

Conclusion: 将城市理论嵌入商业土地利用模型，能显著提升其预测能力，为考虑灾害累积影响的研究提供了新思路。

Abstract: Natural disasters such as hurricanes and wildfires increasingly introduce
unusual disturbance on economic activities, which are especially likely to
reshape commercial land use pattern given their sensitive to customer
visitation. However, current modeling approaches are limited in capturing such
complex interplay between human activities and commercial land use change under
and following disturbances. Such interactions have been more effectively
captured in current resilient urban planning theories. This study designs and
calibrates a Urban Theory-Informed Spatio-Temporal Attention Model for
Predicting Post-Disaster Commercial Land Use Change (Urban-STA4CLC) to predict
both the yearly decline and expansion of commercial land use at census block
level under cumulative impact of disasters on human activities over two years.
Guided by urban theories, Urban-STA4CLC integrates both spatial and temporal
attention mechanisms with three theory-informed modules. Resilience theory
guides a disaster-aware temporal attention module that captures visitation
dynamics. Spatial economic theory informs a multi-relational spatial attention
module for inter-block representation. Diffusion theory contributes a
regularization term that constrains land use transitions. The model performs
significantly better than non-theoretical baselines in predicting commercial
land use change under the scenario of recurrent hurricanes, with around 19%
improvement in F1 score (0.8763). The effectiveness of the theory-guided
modules was further validated through ablation studies. The research
demonstrates that embedding urban theory into commercial land use modeling
models may substantially enhance the capacity to capture its gains and losses.
These advances in commercial land use modeling contribute to land use research
that accounts for cumulative impacts of recurrent disasters and shifts in
economic activity patterns.

Motivation: 针对当前技术创新模式过度追求速度、规模和利润而忽视系统性不公的问题，EJIT原则提供了一种替代方案，强调相互依存、修复和社区自决。

Method: 借鉴1991年环境正义原则，将这一理念扩展到技术领域，提出EJIT原则作为价值观基础设施。

Conclusion: 本文旨在支持集体努力，不仅改变我们构建的技术，还改变其方式、原因和受益对象。

Abstract: This paper introduces the Environmental Justice in Technology (EJIT)
Principles, a framework to help reorient technological development toward
social and ecological justice and collective flourishing. In response to
prevailing models of technological innovation that prioritize speed, scale, and
profit while neglecting systemic injustice, the EJIT principles offer an
alternative: a set of guiding values that foreground interdependence, repair,
and community self-determination. Drawing inspiration from the 1991 principles
of environmental justice, this framework extends their commitments into the
technological domain, treating environmental justice not as a peripheral
concern but as a necessary foundation for building equitable and regenerative
futures. We situate the EJIT principles within the broader landscape of
environmental justice, design justice, and post-growth computing, proposing
them as a values infrastructure for resisting extractive defaults and
envisioning technological systems that operate in reciprocity with people and
the planet. In doing so, this article aims to support collective efforts to
transform not only what technologies we build, but how, why, and for whom.

questions across the modern workforce about this new technology's strengths,
weaknesses, and capabilities. For privacy professionals, the question is
whether these AI systems can provide reliable support on regulatory compliance,
privacy program management, and AI governance. In this study, we evaluate ten

Motivation: 在资源匮乏地区，低剂量儿科X射线因噪声问题影响诊断准确性，传统去噪方法会损失细节。

Method: SharpXR结合拉普拉斯引导的边缘保留解码器和可学习融合模块，模拟Poisson-Gaussian噪声进行训练。

Result: SharpXR在所有评估指标上优于现有方法，肺炎分类准确率从88.8%提升至92.5%。

Conclusion: SharpXR在资源受限环境下高效且有效，具有显著的诊断价值。

Abstract: Pediatric chest X-ray imaging is essential for early diagnosis, particularly
in low-resource settings where advanced imaging modalities are often
inaccessible. Low-dose protocols reduce radiation exposure in children but
introduce substantial noise that can obscure critical anatomical details.
Conventional denoising methods often degrade fine details, compromising
diagnostic accuracy. In this paper, we present SharpXR, a structure-aware
dual-decoder U-Net designed to denoise low-dose pediatric X-rays while
preserving diagnostically relevant features. SharpXR combines a
Laplacian-guided edge-preserving decoder with a learnable fusion module that
adaptively balances noise suppression and structural detail retention. To
address the scarcity of paired training data, we simulate realistic
Poisson-Gaussian noise on the Pediatric Pneumonia Chest X-ray dataset. SharpXR
outperforms state-of-the-art baselines across all evaluation metrics while
maintaining computational efficiency suitable for resource-constrained
settings. SharpXR-denoised images improved downstream pneumonia classification
accuracy from 88.8% to 92.5%, underscoring its diagnostic value in low-resource
pediatric care.

Conclusion: LLMs在历史地理定位中具有可扩展性、准确性和成本效益的潜力。

Abstract: Virginia's seventeenth- and eighteenth-century land patents survive primarily
as narrative metes-and-bounds descriptions, limiting spatial analysis. This
study systematically evaluates current-generation large language models (LLMs)
in converting these prose abstracts into geographically accurate
latitude/longitude coordinates within a focused evaluation context. A digitized
corpus of 5,471 Virginia patent abstracts (1695-1732) is released, with 43
rigorously verified test cases serving as an initial, geographically focused
benchmark. Six OpenAI models across three architectures (o-series, GPT-4-class,
and GPT-3.5) were tested under two paradigms: direct-to-coordinate and
tool-augmented chain-of-thought invoking external geocoding APIs. Results were
compared with a GIS-analyst baseline, the Stanford NER geoparser, Mordecai-3,
and a county-centroid heuristic.
  The top single-call model, o3-2025-04-16, achieved a mean error of 23 km
(median 14 km), outperforming the median LLM (37.4 km) by 37.5%, the weakest
LLM (50.3 km) by 53.5%, and external baselines by 67% (GIS analyst) and 70%
(Stanford NER). A five-call ensemble further reduced errors to 19 km (median 12
km) at minimal additional cost (approx. USD 0.20 per grant), outperforming the
median LLM by 48.6%. A patentee-name-redaction ablation increased error by
about 9%, indicating reliance on textual landmark and adjacency descriptions
rather than memorization. The cost-efficient gpt-4o-2024-08-06 model maintained
a 28 km mean error at USD 1.09 per 1,000 grants, establishing a strong
cost-accuracy benchmark; external geocoding tools offered no measurable benefit
in this evaluation.
  These findings demonstrate the potential of LLMs for scalable, accurate, and
cost-effective historical georeferencing.

Abstract: Large multimodal models (LMMs) have demonstrated significant potential in
providing innovative solutions for various biomedical tasks, including
pathology analysis, radiology report generation, and biomedical assistance.
However, the existing multimodal biomedical AI is typically based on foundation
LLMs, thus hindering the understanding of intricate medical concepts with
limited medical training data. Moreover, recent LLaVA-induced medical LMMs
struggle to effectively capture the intricate relationship between the texts
and the images. Therefore, we introduce Doctor Sun, a large multimodal
generative model specialized in medicine, developed to encode, integrate, and
interpret diverse biomedical data modalities such as text and images. In
particular, Doctor Sun integrates a pre-trained vision encoder with a medical
LLM and conducts two-stage training on various medical datasets, focusing on
feature alignment and instruction tuning. Moreover, we release SunMed-VL, a
wide-range bilingual medical multimodal dataset, along with all associated
models, code, and resources, to freely support the advancement of biomedical

Method: 通过将拓扑构建建模为双优化问题，设计了两阶段算法动态构建最优通信拓扑，并引入重要性感知模型聚合机制。

Result: Hat-DFed框架在复杂边缘环境中能最大化模型性能并最小化累积能耗。

Conclusion: Hat-DFed为解决边缘计算中DFL的挑战提供了一种有效方法，平衡了性能和能耗。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a promising paradigm within edge
computing (EC) systems, enabling numerous edge devices to collaboratively train
artificial intelligence (AI) models while maintaining data privacy. To overcome
the communication bottlenecks associated with centralized parameter servers,
decentralized federated learning (DFL), which leverages peer-to-peer (P2P)
communication, has been extensively explored in the research community.
Although researchers design a variety of DFL approach to ensure model
convergence, its iterative learning process inevitably incurs considerable cost
along with the growth of model complexity and the number of participants. These
costs are largely influenced by the dynamic changes of topology in each
training round, particularly its sparsity and connectivity conditions.
Furthermore, the inherent resources heterogeneity in the edge environments
affects energy efficiency of learning process, while data heterogeneity
degrades model performance. These factors pose significant challenges to the
design of an effective DFL framework for EC systems. To this end, we propose
Hat-DFed, a heterogeneity-aware and coset-effective decentralized federated
learning (DFL) framework. In Hat-DFed, the topology construction is formulated
as a dual optimization problem, which is then proven to be NP-hard, with the
goal of maximizing model performance while minimizing cumulative energy
consumption in complex edge environments. To solve this problem, we design a
two-phase algorithm that dynamically constructs optimal communication
topologies while unbiasedly estimating their impact on both model performance
and energy cost. Additionally, the algorithm incorporates an importance-aware
model aggregation mechanism to mitigate performance degradation caused by data
heterogeneity.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 水质预测因复杂的周期性、非平稳性和生态因素引起的突变波动而具有挑战性，多站点场景进一步增加了时空动态建模的难度。

Method: XFMNet通过自适应降采样对齐时间分辨率，局部自适应分解分离趋势和周期成分，并利用交叉注意力门控融合模块动态整合时空模式。

Result: 实验表明，XFMNet在真实数据集上显著优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: XFMNet通过逐步递归融合有效捕捉长期趋势和短期波动，提升了时空分布时间序列预测的性能。

Abstract: Long-term time-series forecasting is critical for environmental monitoring,
yet water quality prediction remains challenging due to complex periodicity,
nonstationarity, and abrupt fluctuations induced by ecological factors. These
challenges are further amplified in multi-site scenarios that require
simultaneous modeling of temporal and spatial dynamics. To tackle this, we
introduce XFMNet, a stepwise multimodal fusion network that integrates remote
sensing precipitation imagery to provide spatial and environmental context in
river networks. XFMNet first aligns temporal resolutions between water quality
series and remote sensing inputs via adaptive downsampling, followed by locally
adaptive decomposition to disentangle trend and cycle components. A
cross-attention gated fusion module dynamically integrates temporal patterns
with spatial and ecological cues, enhancing robustness to nonstationarity and
site-specific anomalies. Through progressive and recursive fusion, XFMNet
captures both long-term trends and short-term fluctuations. Extensive
experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate substantial improvements over
state-of-the-art baselines, highlighting the effectiveness of XFMNet for
spatially distributed time series prediction.

Result: 在六个数据集上实现了最先进的性能，并通过消融研究验证了各模块的有效性。

Conclusion: MoSSDA通过两阶段学习和对比模块，显著提升了域自适应任务的性能。

Abstract: Deep learning has emerged as the most promising approach in various fields;
however, when the distributions of training and test data are different (domain
shift), the performance of deep learning models can degrade. Semi-supervised
domain adaptation (SSDA) is a major approach for addressing this issue,
assuming that a fully labeled training set (source domain) is available, but
the test set (target domain) provides labels only for a small subset. In this
study, we propose a novel two-step momentum encoder-utilized SSDA framework,
MoSSDA, for multivariate time-series classification. Time series data are
highly sensitive to noise, and sequential dependencies cause domain shifts
resulting in critical performance degradation. To obtain a robust,
domain-invariant and class-discriminative representation, MoSSDA employs a
domain-invariant encoder to learn features from both source and target domains.
Subsequently, the learned features are fed to a mixup-enhanced positive
contrastive module consisting of an online momentum encoder. The final
classifier is trained with learned features that exhibit consistency and
discriminability with limited labeled target domain data, without data
augmentation. We applied a two-stage process by separating the gradient flow
between the encoders and the classifier to obtain rich and complex
representations. Through extensive experiments on six diverse datasets, MoSSDA
achieved state-of-the-art performance for three different backbones and various
unlabeled ratios in the target domain data. The Ablation study confirms that
each module, including two-stage learning, is effective in improving the
performance. Our code is available at https://github.com/seonyoungKimm/MoSSDA

Abstract: Knowledge discovered from telecom data can facilitate proactive understanding
of network dynamics and user behaviors, which in turn empowers service
providers to optimize cellular traffic scheduling and resource allocation.
Nevertheless, the telecom industry still heavily relies on manual expert
intervention. Existing studies have been focused on exhaustively explore the
spatial-temporal correlations. However, they often overlook the underlying
characteristics of cellular traffic, which are shaped by the sporadic and
bursty nature of telecom services. Additionally, concept drift creates
substantial obstacles to maintaining satisfactory accuracy in continuous
cellular forecasting tasks. To resolve these problems, we put forward an online
cellular traffic prediction method grounded in Multi-Grained Spatial-Temporal
feature Complementarity (MGSTC). The proposed method is devised to achieve
high-precision predictions in practical continuous forecasting scenarios.
Concretely, MGSTC segments historical data into chunks and employs the
coarse-grained temporal attention to offer a trend reference for the prediction
horizon. Subsequently, fine-grained spatial attention is utilized to capture
detailed correlations among network elements, which enables localized
refinement of the established trend. The complementarity of these multi-grained
spatial-temporal features facilitates the efficient transmission of valuable
information. To accommodate continuous forecasting needs, we implement an
online learning strategy that can detect concept drift in real-time and
promptly switch to the appropriate parameter update stage. Experiments carried
out on four real-world datasets demonstrate that MGSTC outperforms eleven
state-of-the-art baselines consistently.

Conclusion: 现代AI的成功可能源于生物学优化的计算原理，而不仅仅是架构创新。

Abstract: Transformer architectures have revolutionized artificial intelligence (AI)
through their attention mechanisms, yet the computational principles underlying
their success remain opaque. We present a novel theoretical framework that
reinterprets the core computation of attention as Pavlovian conditioning. Our
model finds a direct mathematical analogue in linear attention, which
simplifies the analysis of the underlying associative process. We demonstrate
that attention's queries, keys, and values can be mapped to the three elements
of classical conditioning: test stimuli that probe associations, conditional
stimuli (CS) that serve as retrieval cues, and unconditional stimuli (US) that
contain response information. Through this lens, we suggest that each attention
operation constructs a transient associative memory via a Hebbian rule, where
CS-US pairs form dynamic associations that test stimuli can later retrieve. Our
framework yields several theoretical insights grounded in this linearized
model: (1) a capacity theorem showing that attention heads can store
O($\sqrt{d_k}$) associations before interference degrades retrieval; (2) an
error propagation analysis revealing fundamental architectural trade-offs of
balancing model depth, width, and head redundancy to maintain reliability; and
(3) an understanding of how biologically plausible learning rules could enhance
transformer architectures. By establishing this deep connection, we suggest
that the success of modern AI may stem not from architectural novelty alone,
but from implementing computational principles that biology optimized over
millions of years of evolution.

Abstract: Recent research has proven neural networks to be a powerful tool for
performing hyperspectral imaging (HSI) target identification. However, many
deep learning frameworks deliver a single material class prediction and operate
on a per-pixel basis; such approaches are limited in their interpretability and
restricted to predicting materials that are accessible in available training
libraries. In this work, we present an inverse modeling approach in the form of
a physics-conditioned generative model.A probabilistic latent-variable model
learns the underlying distribution of HSI radiance measurements and produces
the conditional distribution of the emissivity spectrum. Moreover, estimates of
the HSI scene's atmosphere and background are used as a physically relevant
conditioning mechanism to contextualize a given radiance measurement during the
encoding and decoding processes. Furthermore, we employ an in-the-loop
augmentation scheme and physics-based loss criteria to avoid bias towards a
predefined training material set and to encourage the model to learn physically
consistent inverse mappings. Monte-Carlo sampling of the model's conditioned
posterior delivers a sought emissivity distribution and allows for
interpretable uncertainty quantification. Moreover, a distribution-based
material matching scheme is presented to return a set of likely material
matches for an inferred emissivity distribution. Hence, we present a strategy
to incorporate contextual information about a given HSI scene, capture the
possible variation of underlying material spectra, and provide interpretable
probability measures of a candidate material accounting for given
remotely-sensed radiance measurement.

Result: 离线实验验证了方法的有效性，在线A/B测试中实现了11.29%的转化率和12.35%的收入提升。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了自动竞价的性能和效率。

Abstract: Auto-bidding is extensively applied in advertising systems, serving a
multitude of advertisers. Generative bidding is gradually gaining traction due
to its robust planning capabilities and generalizability. In contrast to
traditional reinforcement learning-based bidding, generative bidding does not
rely on the Markov Decision Process (MDP) exhibiting superior planning
capabilities in long-horizon scenarios. Conditional diffusion modeling
approaches have demonstrated significant potential in the realm of
auto-bidding. However, relying solely on return as the optimality condition is
weak to guarantee the generation of genuinely optimal decision sequences,
lacking personalized structural information. Moreover, diffusion models' t-step
autoregressive generation mechanism inherently carries timeliness risks. To
address these issues, we propose a novel conditional diffusion modeling method
based on expert trajectory guidance combined with a skip-step sampling strategy
to enhance generation efficiency. We have validated the effectiveness of this
approach through extensive offline experiments and achieved statistically
significant results in online A/B testing, achieving an increase of 11.29% in
conversion and a 12.35% in revenue compared with the baseline.

Conclusion: MLP通道混合能提升循环卷积网络的泛化能力，DAMP适合作为超网络的目标架构。

Abstract: We investigate the impact of channel-wise mixing via multi-layer perceptrons
(MLPs) on the generalization capabilities of recurrent convolutional networks.
Specifically, we compare two architectures: DARC (Depth Aware Recurrent
Convolution), which employs a simple recurrent convolutional structure, and
DAMP (Depth Aware Multi-layer Perceptron), which extends DARC with a gated MLP
for channel mixing. Using the Re-ARC benchmark, we find that DAMP significantly
outperforms DARC in both in-distribution and out-of-distribution generalization
under exact-match grading criteria. These results suggest that explicit channel
mixing through MLPs enables recurrent convolutional networks to learn more
robust and generalizable computational patterns. Our findings have implications
for neural program synthesis and highlight the potential of DAMP as a target
architecture for hypernetwork approaches.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一个开源的基准测试，用于比较γ射线光谱分析中的统计方法和机器学习方法，发现统计方法在已知或建模良好的光谱特征下表现更优，而机器学习在不确定条件下是更好的替代方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于缺乏通用的基准测试（包括数据集、代码和比较指标），现有γ射线光谱分析方法的评估和比较变得困难。

Method: 提出了一个包含模拟数据集、不同分析方法和评估指标的基准测试，比较了统计方法和端到端机器学习方法在三种场景下的表现。

Result: 统计方法在所有场景和指标中表现优于机器学习方法，但在光谱特征建模不准确时性能显著下降；机器学习在不确定条件下表现更好。

Conclusion: 统计方法适用于已知或建模良好的光谱特征，而机器学习在不确定条件下是更好的选择；统计方法在定量任务中更准确。

Abstract: During the last decade, a large number of different numerical methods have
been proposed to tackle the automatic identification and quantification in
{\gamma}-ray spectrometry. However, the lack of common benchmarks, including
datasets, code and comparison metrics, makes their evaluation and comparison
hard. In that context, we propose an open-source benchmark that comprises
simulated datasets of various {\gamma}-spectrometry settings, codes of
different analysis approaches and evaluation metrics. This allows us to compare
the state-of-the-art end-to-end machine learning with a statistical unmixing
approach using the full spectrum. Three scenarios have been investigated: (1)
spectral signatures are assumed to be known; (2) spectral signatures are
deformed due to physical phenomena such as Compton scattering and attenuation;
and (3) spectral signatures are shifted (e.g., due to temperature variation). A
large dataset of 200000 simulated spectra containing nine radionuclides with an
experimental natural background is used for each scenario with multiple
radionuclides present in the spectrum. Regarding identification performance,
the statistical approach consistently outperforms the machine learning
approaches across all three scenarios for all comparison metrics. However, the
performance of the statistical approach can be significantly impacted when
spectral signatures are not modeled correctly. Consequently, the full-spectrum
statistical approach is most effective with known or well-modeled spectral
signatures, while end-to-end machine learning is a good alternative when
measurement conditions are uncertain for radionuclide identification.
Concerning the quantification task, the statistical approach provides accurate
estimates of radionuclide counting, while the machine learning methods deliver
less satisfactory results.

TL;DR: 论文提出HSA-Net框架，通过分层特征投影和融合解决GNN的过平滑问题，结合Mamba和交叉注意力模块，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GNN在深层网络中存在过平滑问题，现有方法在深层特征上表现不佳，因此探索Mamba作为替代投影器，并解决其全局-局部权衡问题。

Method: 提出HSA-Net框架，包含分层自适应投影器（HAP）模块和源感知融合（SAF）模块，分别处理不同层次特征并动态融合。

Result: 实验表明HSA-Net在定量和定性上均优于当前最先进方法。

Conclusion: HSA-Net通过分层特征投影和融合有效解决了GNN的过平滑问题，为分子表示学习提供了新思路。

Abstract: Molecular representation learning, a cornerstone for downstream tasks like
molecular captioning and molecular property prediction, heavily relies on Graph
Neural Networks (GNN). However, GNN suffers from the over-smoothing problem,
where node-level features collapse in deep GNN layers. While existing feature
projection methods with cross-attention have been introduced to mitigate this
issue, they still perform poorly in deep features. This motivated our
exploration of using Mamba as an alternative projector for its ability to
handle complex sequences. However, we observe that while Mamba excels at
preserving global topological information from deep layers, it neglects
fine-grained details in shallow layers. The capabilities of Mamba and
cross-attention exhibit a global-local trade-off. To resolve this critical
global-local trade-off, we propose Hierarchical and Structure-Aware Network
(HSA-Net), a novel framework with two modules that enables a hierarchical
feature projection and fusion. Firstly, a Hierarchical Adaptive Projector (HAP)
module is introduced to process features from different graph layers. It learns
to dynamically switch between a cross-attention projector for shallow layers
and a structure-aware Graph-Mamba projector for deep layers, producing
high-quality, multi-level features. Secondly, to adaptively merge these
multi-level features, we design a Source-Aware Fusion (SAF) module, which
flexibly selects fusion experts based on the characteristics of the aggregation
features, ensuring a precise and effective final representation fusion.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our HSA-Net framework quantitatively and
qualitatively outperforms current state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SHeRL-FL结合了分层联邦学习和分割学习，通过中间层表示学习减少通信开销和协调复杂性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有联邦学习框架中设备计算异构性和通信成本高的问题。

Method: 整合分割学习和分层模型聚合，引入中间层表示学习。

Result: 实验表明，SHeRL-FL比集中式FL和分层FL减少90%数据传输，比SplitFed减少50%。

Conclusion: SHeRL-FL显著降低了通信和协调成本，同时提升了性能。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a promising approach for addressing scalability
and latency issues in large-scale networks by enabling collaborative model
training without requiring the sharing of raw data. However, existing FL
frameworks often overlook the computational heterogeneity of edge clients and
the growing training burden on resource-limited devices. However, FL suffers
from high communication costs and complex model aggregation, especially with
large models. Previous works combine split learning (SL) and hierarchical FL
(HierFL) to reduce device-side computation and improve scalability, but this
introduces training complexity due to coordination across tiers. To address
these issues, we propose SHeRL-FL, which integrates SL and hierarchical model
aggregation and incorporates representation learning at intermediate layers. By
allowing clients and edge servers to compute training objectives independently
of the cloud, SHeRL-FL significantly reduces both coordination complexity and
communication overhead. To evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of
SHeRL-FL, we performed experiments on image classification tasks using
CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and HAM10000 with AlexNet, ResNet-18, and ResNet-50 in
both IID and non-IID settings. In addition, we evaluate performance on image
segmentation tasks using the ISIC-2018 dataset with a ResNet-50-based U-Net.
Experimental results demonstrate that SHeRL-FL reduces data transmission by
over 90\% compared to centralized FL and HierFL, and by 50\% compared to
SplitFed, which is a hybrid of FL and SL, and further improves hierarchical
split learning methods.

### [106] [Fuzzy-Pattern Tsetlin Machine](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08350)
*Artem Hnilov*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种模糊模式Tsetlin机（FPTM），通过模糊评估子句中的字面量，显著减少了所需子句数量、内存占用和训练时间，同时提高了准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的Tsetlin机（TM）采用“全有或全无”的子句评估策略，导致需要大量子句才能达到竞争性准确率。FPTM旨在通过模糊评估机制解决这一问题。

Method: FPTM引入模糊评估机制，允许子句中部分字面量失败时，其余字面量仍能按比例贡献投票分数，从而更灵活地匹配模式。

Result: 在多个数据集上，FPTM显著减少了子句数量（如50倍）、内存占用和训练时间（如316倍），同时提高了准确率（如IMDb上90.15%）。

Conclusion: FPTM通过模糊评估机制实现了高效、灵活和鲁棒的模式匹配，适用于在线学习和资源受限环境。

Abstract: The "all-or-nothing" clause evaluation strategy is a core mechanism in the
Tsetlin Machine (TM) family of algorithms. In this approach, each clause - a
logical pattern composed of binary literals mapped to input data - is
disqualified from voting if even a single literal fails. Due to this strict
requirement, standard TMs must employ thousands of clauses to achieve
competitive accuracy. This paper introduces the Fuzzy-Pattern Tsetlin Machine
(FPTM), a novel variant where clause evaluation is fuzzy rather than strict. If
some literals in a clause fail, the remaining ones can still contribute to the
overall vote with a proportionally reduced score. As a result, each clause
effectively consists of sub-patterns that adapt individually to the input,
enabling more flexible, efficient, and robust pattern matching. The proposed
fuzzy mechanism significantly reduces the required number of clauses, memory
footprint, and training time, while simultaneously improving accuracy. On the
IMDb dataset, FPTM achieves 90.15% accuracy with only one clause per class, a
50x reduction in clauses and memory over the Coalesced Tsetlin Machine. FPTM
trains up to 316x faster (45 seconds vs. 4 hours) and fits within 50 KB,
enabling online learning on microcontrollers. Inference throughput reaches 34.5
million predictions/second (51.4 GB/s). On Fashion-MNIST, accuracy reaches
92.18% (2 clauses), 93.19% (20 clauses) and 94.68% (8000 clauses), a ~400x
clause reduction compared to the Composite TM's 93.00% (8000 clauses). On the
Amazon Sales dataset with 20% noise, FPTM achieves 85.22% accuracy,
significantly outperforming the Graph Tsetlin Machine (78.17%) and a Graph
Convolutional Neural Network (66.23%).

*Elon Litman*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文从第一性原理出发，为缩放点积注意力（SDPA）机制提供了理论依据，揭示了其前向传播和后向传播的数学本质。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代深度学习中的SDPA机制通常基于启发式设计，缺乏理论支持。本文旨在从基本原理出发，为SDPA提供严格的数学解释。

Method: 将SDPA的前向传播建模为一个退化的单边熵最优传输（EOT）问题，证明其梯度更新与强化学习中的优势策略梯度一致，并分析了信息几何的影响。

Result: 证明了SDPA的前向传播是EOT问题的精确解，后向传播的梯度与优势策略梯度等价，且信息几何决定了梯度的具体形式。

Conclusion: SDPA是一个有理论依据的机制，前向传播实现最优推断，后向传播执行基于流形的理性学习更新。

Abstract: The scaled-dot-product attention (SDPA) mechanism is a core component of
modern deep learning, but its mathematical form is often motivated by
heuristics. This work provides a first-principles justification for SDPA. We
first show that the attention forward pass is the exact solution to a
degenerate, one-sided Entropic Optimal Transport (EOT) problem, which seeks a
distribution that maximizes similarity while being maximally entropic. This
optimization perspective has a direct consequence for the backward pass. We
prove that the standard gradient computed via backpropagation is mathematically
identical to an advantage-based policy gradient, a variance-reduced update rule
from reinforcement learning. Crucially, we demonstrate that the EOT formulation
of the forward pass induces a specific information geometry on the space of
attention distributions. It is this geometry, characterized by the Fisher
Information Matrix, that dictates the precise form of the learning gradient,
revealing the advantage-based update as a natural consequence of the
optimization problem being solved. This unified view reveals SDPA as a
principled mechanism where the forward pass performs optimal inference and the
backward pass implements a rational, manifold-aware learning update.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为OOPE的算法，结合离线数据显著减少在线遗憾，并通过扩展D-最优设计优化探索阶段。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在线推荐系统和广告等领域中，离线数据丰富但未被充分利用，如何有效结合离线数据以减少在线遗憾成为研究重点。

Method: OOPE算法在探索阶段使用扩展D-最优设计，通过离线数据的Gram矩阵特征谱衡量数据质量，动态调整策略。

Result: 算法在线遗憾为$\tilde{O}(\sqrt{\deff T \log \left(|\mathcal{A}|T\right)}+d^2)$，离线数据质量高时遗憾显著降低。

Conclusion: OOPE在离线数据质量不同情况下均表现最优，并通过Frank-Wolfe近似进一步优化性能。

Abstract: We consider the problem of online regret minimization in linear bandits with
access to prior observations (offline data) from the underlying bandit model.
There are numerous applications where extensive offline data is often
available, such as in recommendation systems, online advertising. Consequently,
this problem has been studied intensively in recent literature. Our algorithm,
Offline-Online Phased Elimination (OOPE), effectively incorporates the offline
data to substantially reduce the online regret compared to prior work. To
leverage offline information prudently, OOPE uses an extended D-optimal design
within each exploration phase. OOPE achieves an online regret is
$\tilde{O}(\sqrt{\deff T \log \left(|\mathcal{A}|T\right)}+d^2)$. $\deff \leq
d)$ is the effective problem dimension which measures the number of poorly
explored directions in offline data and depends on the eigen-spectrum
$(\lambda_k)_{k \in [d]}$ of the Gram matrix of the offline data. The
eigen-spectrum $(\lambda_k)_{k \in [d]}$ is a quantitative measure of the
\emph{quality} of offline data. If the offline data is poorly explored ($\deff
\approx d$), we recover the established regret bounds for purely online setting
while, when offline data is abundant ($\Toff >> T$) and well-explored ($\deff =
o(1) $), the online regret reduces substantially. Additionally, we provide the
first known minimax regret lower bounds in this setting that depend explicitly
on the quality of the offline data. These lower bounds establish the optimality
of our algorithm in regimes where offline data is either well-explored or
poorly explored. Finally, by using a Frank-Wolfe approximation to the extended
optimal design we further improve the $O(d^{2})$ term to
$O\left(\frac{d^{2}}{\deff} \min \{ \deff,1\} \right)$, which can be
substantial in high dimensions with moderate quality of offline data $\deff =
\Omega(1)$.

Conclusion: 结论指出FWPs为自然与人工智能的融合提供了新视角，突显了其在机器学习和神经科学中的潜力。

Abstract: Recent advances in artificial neural networks for machine learning, and
language modeling in particular, have established a family of recurrent neural
network (RNN) architectures that, unlike conventional RNNs with vector-form
hidden states, use two-dimensional (2D) matrix-form hidden states. Such
2D-state RNNs, known as Fast Weight Programmers (FWPs), can be interpreted as a
neural network whose synaptic weights (called fast weights) dynamically change
over time as a function of input observations, and serve as short-term memory
storage; corresponding synaptic weight modifications are controlled or
programmed by another network (the programmer) whose parameters are trained
(e.g., by gradient descent). In this Primer, we review the technical
foundations of FWPs, their computational characteristics, and their connections
to transformers and state space models. We also discuss connections between
FWPs and models of synaptic plasticity in the brain, suggesting a convergence
of natural and artificial intelligence.

Motivation: 理解变量间的因果关系是科学研究的核心，但现有方法通常假设所有变量可观测且因果图为无环，这在现实系统中常不成立。

Method: DCCD-CONF交替优化图结构和混杂因素分布，通过最大化数据对数似然实现。

Result: 实验表明，DCCD-CONF在因果图恢复和混杂因素识别上优于现有方法，并具有理论一致性保证。

Conclusion: DCCD-CONF为非线性循环因果图学习提供了有效且理论可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Understanding causal relationships between variables is fundamental across
scientific disciplines. Most causal discovery algorithms rely on two key
assumptions: (i) all variables are observed, and (ii) the underlying causal
graph is acyclic. While these assumptions simplify theoretical analysis, they
are often violated in real-world systems, such as biological networks. Existing
methods that account for confounders either assume linearity or struggle with
scalability. To address these limitations, we propose DCCD-CONF, a novel
framework for differentiable learning of nonlinear cyclic causal graphs in the
presence of unmeasured confounders using interventional data. Our approach
alternates between optimizing the graph structure and estimating the confounder
distribution by maximizing the log-likelihood of the data. Through experiments
on synthetic data and real-world gene perturbation datasets, we show that
DCCD-CONF outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both causal graph recovery
and confounder identification. Additionally, we also provide consistency
guarantees for our framework, reinforcing its theoretical soundness.

Abstract: Liver cancer is one of the most prevalent and lethal forms of cancer, making
early detection crucial for effective treatment. This paper introduces a novel
approach for automated liver tumor segmentation in computed tomography (CT)
images by integrating a 3D U-Net architecture with the Bat Algorithm for
hyperparameter optimization. The method enhances segmentation accuracy and
robustness by intelligently optimizing key parameters like the learning rate
and batch size. Evaluated on a publicly available dataset, our model
demonstrates a strong ability to balance precision and recall, with a high
F1-score at lower prediction thresholds. This is particularly valuable for
clinical diagnostics, where ensuring no potential tumors are missed is
paramount. Our work contributes to the field of medical image analysis by
demonstrating that the synergy between a robust deep learning architecture and
a metaheuristic optimization algorithm can yield a highly effective solution
for complex segmentation tasks.

Result: 在多个数据集上验证，DiGNNExplainer生成的解释更真实且忠实于模型决策，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DiGNNExplainer填补了异构图解释方法的空白，为模型决策提供了更可靠的解释。

Abstract: Many real-world datasets, such as citation networks, social networks, and
molecular structures, are naturally represented as heterogeneous graphs, where
nodes belong to different types and have additional features. For example, in a
citation network, nodes representing "Paper" or "Author" may include attributes
like keywords or affiliations. A critical machine learning task on these graphs
is node classification, which is useful for applications such as fake news
detection, corporate risk assessment, and molecular property prediction.
Although Heterogeneous Graph Neural Networks (HGNNs) perform well in these
contexts, their predictions remain opaque. Existing post-hoc explanation
methods lack support for actual node features beyond one-hot encoding of node
type and often fail to generate realistic, faithful explanations. To address
these gaps, we propose DiGNNExplainer, a model-level explanation approach that
synthesizes heterogeneous graphs with realistic node features via discrete
denoising diffusion. In particular, we generate realistic discrete features
(e.g., bag-of-words features) using diffusion models within a discrete space,
whereas previous approaches are limited to continuous spaces. We evaluate our
approach on multiple datasets and show that DiGNNExplainer produces
explanations that are realistic and faithful to the model's decision-making,
outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统最优传输（OT）假设输入质量相等，而部分最优传输（POT）放宽了这一限制，但现有方法依赖熵正则化，导致传输计划稠密，限制了其在需要稀疏性的应用中的使用。

Method: 提出了一种二次正则化的POT方法（QPOT），通过二次正则化诱导稀疏传输计划。

Result: 在合成数据、CIFAR-10数据集及实际应用（如颜色迁移和领域适应）中，QPOT表现出更高的稀疏性和优越性能。

Conclusion: QPOT为需要稀疏传输计划的应用提供了一种有效解决方案，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Partial Optimal Transport (POT) has recently emerged as a central tool in
various Machine Learning (ML) applications. It lifts the stringent assumption
of the conventional Optimal Transport (OT) that input measures are of equal
masses, which is often not guaranteed in real-world datasets, and thus offers
greater flexibility by permitting transport between unbalanced input measures.
Nevertheless, existing major solvers for POT commonly rely on entropic
regularization for acceleration and thus return dense transport plans,
hindering the adoption of POT in various applications that favor sparsity. In
this paper, as an alternative approach to the entropic POT formulation in the
literature, we propose a novel formulation of POT with quadratic
regularization, hence termed quadratic regularized POT (QPOT), which induces
sparsity to the transport plan and consequently facilitates the adoption of POT
in many applications with sparsity requirements. Extensive experiments on
synthetic and CIFAR-10 datasets, as well as real-world applications such as
color transfer and domain adaptations, consistently demonstrate the improved
sparsity and favorable performance of our proposed QPOT formulation.

Result: 在异构环境中，该方法显著加速训练，达到或超过同步SGD的精度。

Conclusion: 该方法可扩展至多种异构环境，如云平台和高性能计算集群。

Abstract: Most large-scale neural network training methods assume homogeneous parallel
computing resources. For example, synchronous SGD with data parallelism, the
most widely used parallel training strategy, incurs significant synchronization
overhead when workers process their assigned data at different speeds.
Consequently, in systems with heterogeneous compute resources, users often rely
solely on the fastest components, such as GPUs, for training. In this work, we
explore how to effectively use heterogeneous resources for neural network
training. We propose a system-aware local stochastic gradient descent (local
SGD) method that allocates workloads to each compute resource in proportion to
its compute capacity. To make better use of slower resources such as CPUs, we
intentionally introduce bias into data sampling and model aggregation. Our
study shows that well-controlled bias can significantly accelerate local SGD in
heterogeneous environments, achieving comparable or even higher accuracy than
synchronous SGD with data-parallelism within the same time budget. This
fundamental parallelization strategy can be readily extended to diverse
heterogeneous environments, including cloud platforms and multi-node
high-performance computing clusters.

Abstract: Achieving accurate traffic prediction is a fundamental but crucial task in
the development of current intelligent transportation systems.Most of the
mainstream methods that have made breakthroughs in traffic prediction rely on
spatio-temporal graph neural networks, spatio-temporal attention mechanisms,
etc. The main challenges of the existing deep learning approaches are that they
either depend on a complete traffic network structure or require intricate
model designs to capture complex spatio-temporal dependencies. These
limitations pose significant challenges for the efficient deployment and
operation of deep learning models on large-scale datasets. To address these
challenges, we propose a cost-effective graph-free Multilayer Perceptron (MLP)
based model M3-Net for traffic prediction. Our proposed model not only employs
time series and spatio-temporal embeddings for efficient feature processing but
also first introduces a novel MLP-Mixer architecture with a mixture of experts
(MoE) mechanism. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple real datasets
demonstrate the superiority of the proposed model in terms of prediction
performance and lightweight deployment.

Abstract: Spatiotemporal prediction plays a critical role in numerous real-world
applications such as urban planning, transportation optimization, disaster
response, and pandemic control. In recent years, researchers have made
significant progress by developing advanced deep learning models for
spatiotemporal prediction. However, most existing models are deterministic,
i.e., predicting only the expected mean values without quantifying uncertainty,
leading to potentially unreliable and inaccurate outcomes. While recent studies
have introduced probabilistic models to quantify uncertainty, they typically
focus on a single phenomenon (e.g., taxi, bike, crime, or traffic crashes),
thereby neglecting the inherent correlations among heterogeneous urban
phenomena. To address the research gap, we propose a novel Graph Neural Network
with Uncertainty Quantification, termed UQGNN for multivariate spatiotemporal
prediction. UQGNN introduces two key innovations: (i) an Interaction-aware
Spatiotemporal Embedding Module that integrates a multivariate diffusion graph
convolutional network and an interaction-aware temporal convolutional network
to effectively capture complex spatial and temporal interaction patterns, and
(ii) a multivariate probabilistic prediction module designed to estimate both
expected mean values and associated uncertainties. Extensive experiments on
four real-world multivariate spatiotemporal datasets from Shenzhen, New York
City, and Chicago demonstrate that UQGNN consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines in both prediction accuracy and uncertainty
quantification. For example, on the Shenzhen dataset, UQGNN achieves a 5%
improvement in both prediction accuracy and uncertainty quantification.

Conclusion: SHEFL为异构计算环境下的联邦学习提供了高效且公平的解决方案。

Abstract: Federated learning enables distributed training with private data of clients,
but its convergence is hindered by data and system heterogeneity in realistic
communication scenarios. Most existing system heterogeneous FL schemes utilize
global pruning or ensemble distillation, yet they often overlook typical
constraints required for communication efficiency. Meanwhile, deep ensembles
can aggregate predictions from individually trained models to improve
performance, but current ensemble-based FL methods fall short in fully
capturing the diversity of model predictions. In this work, we propose SHEFL, a
global ensemble-based federated learning framework suited for clients with
diverse computational capacities. We allocate different numbers of global
models to clients based on their available resources. We further introduce a
novel aggregation scheme that accounts for bias between clients with different
computational capabilities. To reduce the computational burden of training deep
ensembles and mitigate data bias, we dynamically adjust the resource ratio
across clients - aggressively reducing the influence of underpowered clients in
constrained scenarios, while increasing their weight in the opposite case.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method effectively addresses
computational heterogeneity, significantly improving both fairness and overall
performance compared to existing approaches.

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL), as a distributed collaborative Machine Learning (ML)
framework under privacy-preserving constraints, has garnered increasing
research attention in cross-organizational data collaboration scenarios. This
paper proposes a class of distributed optimization algorithms based on the
augmented Lagrangian technique, designed to accommodate diverse communication
topologies in both centralized and decentralized FL settings. Furthermore, we
develop multiple termination criteria and parameter update mechanisms to
enhance computational efficiency, accompanied by rigorous theoretical
guarantees of convergence. By generalizing the augmented Lagrangian relaxation
through the incorporation of proximal relaxation and quadratic approximation,
our framework systematically recovers a broad of classical unconstrained
optimization methods, including proximal algorithm, classic gradient descent,
and stochastic gradient descent, among others. Notably, the convergence
properties of these methods can be naturally derived within the proposed
theoretical framework. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed
algorithm exhibits strong performance in large-scale settings with significant
statistical heterogeneity across clients.

Abstract: Low-rank training methods reduce the number of trainable parameters by
re-parameterizing the weights with matrix decompositions (e.g., singular value
decomposition). However, enforcing a fixed low-rank structure caps the rank of
the weight matrices and can hinder the model's ability to learn complex
patterns. Furthermore, the effective rank of the model's weights tends to
decline during training, and this drop is accelerated when the model is
reparameterized into a low-rank structure. In this study, we argue that
strategically interleaving full-rank training epochs within low-rank training
epochs can effectively restore the rank of the model's weights. Based on our
findings, we propose a general dynamic-rank training framework that is readily
applicable to a wide range of neural-network tasks. We first describe how to
adjust the rank of weight matrix to alleviate the inevitable rank collapse that
arises during training, and then present extensive empirical results that
validate our claims and demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed framework. Our
empirical study shows that the proposed method achieves almost the same
computational cost as SVD-based low-rank training while achieving a comparable
accuracy to full-rank training across various benchmarks.

Conclusion: 令牌驱动的稀疏微调策略是一种高效且经济的方法，适用于专业分类任务，能够在保持性能的同时减少计算资源消耗。

Abstract: Semantic text classification requires the understanding of the contextual
significance of specific tokens rather than surface-level patterns or keywords
(as in rule-based or statistical text classification), making large language
models (LLMs) well-suited for this task. However, semantic classification
applications in industry, like customer intent detection or semantic role
labeling, tend to be highly specialized. They require annotation by domain
experts in contrast to general-purpose corpora for pretraining. Further, they
typically require high inference throughputs which limits the model size from
latency and cost perspectives. Thus, for a range of specialized classification
tasks, the preferred solution is to develop customized classifiers by
finetuning smaller language models (e.g., mini-encoders, small language
models).
  In this work, we develop a token-driven sparse finetuning strategy to adapt
small language models to specialized classification tasks. We identify and
finetune a small sensitive subset of model parameters by leveraging
task-specific token constructs in the finetuning dataset, while leaving most of
the pretrained weights unchanged. Unlike adapter approaches such as low rank
adaptation (LoRA), we do not introduce additional parameters to the model. Our
approach identifies highly relevant semantic tokens (case study in the
Appendix) and outperforms end-to-end finetuning, LoRA, layer selection, and
prefix tuning on five diverse semantic classification tasks. We achieve greater
stability and half the training costs vs. end-to-end finetuning.

Result: 在单词搜索、分子优化和ARC程序归纳等任务中，MiGrATe显著优于仅推理和传统测试时训练基线。

Conclusion: MiGrATe展示了在线测试时训练在无需外部监督下解决复杂搜索任务的潜力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being applied to black-box
optimization tasks, from program synthesis to molecule design. Prior work
typically leverages in-context learning to iteratively guide the model towards
better solutions. Such methods, however, often struggle to balance exploration
of new solution spaces with exploitation of high-reward ones. Recently,
test-time training (TTT) with synthetic data has shown promise in improving
solution quality. However, the need for hand-crafted training data tailored to
each task limits feasibility and scalability across domains. To address this
problem, we introduce MiGrATe-a method for online TTT that uses GRPO as a
search algorithm to adapt LLMs at inference without requiring external training
data. MiGrATe operates via a mixed-policy group construction procedure that
combines on-policy sampling with two off-policy data selection techniques:
greedy sampling, which selects top-performing past completions, and
neighborhood sampling (NS), which generates completions structurally similar to
high-reward ones. Together, these components bias the policy gradient towards
exploitation of promising regions in solution space, while preserving
exploration through on-policy sampling. We evaluate MiGrATe on three
challenging domains-word search, molecule optimization, and hypothesis+program
induction on the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC)-and find that it
consistently outperforms both inference-only and TTT baselines, demonstrating
the potential of online TTT as a solution for complex search tasks without
external supervision.

Abstract: Accurate molecular property prediction is a critical challenge with
wide-ranging applications in chemistry, materials science, and drug discovery.
Molecular representation methods, including fingerprints and graph neural
networks (GNNs), achieve state-of-the-art results by effectively deriving
features from molecular structures. However, these methods often overlook
decades of accumulated semantic and contextual knowledge. Recent advancements
in large language models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable reasoning abilities and
prior knowledge across scientific domains, leading us to hypothesize that LLMs
can generate rich molecular representations when guided to reason in multiple
perspectives. To address these gaps, we propose $\text{M}^{2}$LLM, a multi-view
framework that integrates three perspectives: the molecular structure view, the
molecular task view, and the molecular rules view. These views are fused
dynamically to adapt to task requirements, and experiments demonstrate that
$\text{M}^{2}$LLM achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks
across classification and regression tasks. Moreover, we demonstrate that
representation derived from LLM achieves exceptional performance by leveraging
two core functionalities: the generation of molecular embeddings through their
encoding capabilities and the curation of molecular features through advanced
reasoning processes.

Motivation: 在线类增量学习（OCIL）面临严格内存限制下的模型稳定性与任务适应性挑战，现有方法难以平衡二者。

Method: 提出GWM作为共享隐式记忆，融合学生模型参数并定期重新分配，结合多级协作蒸馏机制，保持学生模型间一致性。

Result: 在三个标准OCIL基准测试中，该方法显著提升了多种OCIL模型的性能。

Conclusion: GWM方法有效平衡了稳定性和适应性，为OCIL提供了更优解决方案。

Abstract: Online Class-Incremental Learning (OCIL) enables models to learn continuously
from non-i.i.d. data streams and samples of the data streams can be seen only
once, making it more suitable for real-world scenarios compared to offline
learning. However, OCIL faces two key challenges: maintaining model stability
under strict memory constraints and ensuring adaptability to new tasks. Under
stricter memory constraints, current replay-based methods are less effective.
While ensemble methods improve adaptability (plasticity), they often struggle
with stability. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel approach that
enhances ensemble learning through a Global Workspace Model (GWM)-a shared,
implicit memory that guides the learning of multiple student models. The GWM is
formed by fusing the parameters of all students within each training batch,
capturing the historical learning trajectory and serving as a dynamic anchor
for knowledge consolidation. This fused model is then redistributed
periodically to the students to stabilize learning and promote cross-task
consistency. In addition, we introduce a multi-level collaborative distillation
mechanism. This approach enforces peer-to-peer consistency among students and
preserves historical knowledge by aligning each student with the GWM. As a
result, student models remain adaptable to new tasks while maintaining
previously learned knowledge, striking a better balance between stability and
plasticity. Extensive experiments on three standard OCIL benchmarks show that
our method delivers significant performance improvement for several OCIL models
across various memory budgets.

Conclusion: COGS通过生成式采样提升了TSP问题的分布鲁棒性，为解决实际物流问题提供了更可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: The Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is a classic NP-hard combinatorial
optimization task with numerous practical applications. Classic heuristic
solvers can attain near-optimal performance for small problem instances, but
become computationally intractable for larger problems. Real-world logistics
problems such as dynamically re-routing last-mile deliveries demand a solver
with fast inference time, which has led researchers to investigate specialized
neural network solvers. However, neural networks struggle to generalize beyond
the synthetic data they were trained on. In particular, we show that there
exist TSP distributions that are realistic in practice, which also consistently
lead to poor worst-case performance for existing neural approaches. To address
this issue of distribution robustness, we present Combinatorial Optimization
with Generative Sampling (COGS), where training data is sampled from a
generative TSP model. We show that COGS provides better data coverage and
interpolation in the space of TSP training distributions. We also present
TSPLib50, a dataset of realistically distributed TSP samples, which tests
real-world generalization ability without conflating this issue with instance
size. We evaluate our method on various synthetic datasets as well as TSPLib50,
and compare to state-of-the-art neural baselines. We demonstrate that COGS
improves distribution robustness, with most performance gains coming from
worst-case scenarios.

Abstract: Recently, rectified flow (RF)-based models have achieved state-of-the-art
performance in many areas for both the multi-step and one-step generation.
However, only a few theoretical works analyze the discretization complexity of
RF-based models. Existing works either focus on flow-based models with
stochastic samplers or establish complexity results that exhibit exponential
dependence on problem parameters. In this work, under the realistic bounded
support assumption, we prove the first polynomial discretization complexity for
multi-step and one-step RF-based models with a deterministic sampler
simultaneously. For the multi-step setting, inspired by the predictor-corrector
framework of diffusion models, we introduce a Langevin process as a corrector
and show that RF-based models can achieve better polynomial discretization
complexity than diffusion models. To achieve this result, we conduct a detailed
analysis of the RF-based model and explain why it is better than previous
popular models, such as variance preserving (VP) and variance exploding
(VE)-based models. Based on the observation of multi-step RF-based models, we
further provide the first polynomial discretization complexity result for
one-step RF-based models, improving upon prior results for one-step
diffusion-based models. These findings mark the first step toward theoretically
understanding the impressive empirical performance of RF-based models in both
multi-step and one-step generation.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have been widely deployed across numerous
fields. Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) leverages reward
models (RMs) as proxies for human preferences to align LLM behaviors with human
values, making the accuracy, reliability, and interpretability of RMs critical
for effective alignment. However, traditional RMs lack interpretability, offer
limited insight into the reasoning behind reward assignments, and are
inflexible toward user preference shifts. While recent multidimensional RMs aim
for improved interpretability, they often fail to provide feature-level
attribution and require costly annotations. To overcome these limitations, we
introduce the Sparse Autoencoder-enhanced Reward Model (\textbf{SARM}), a novel
architecture that integrates a pretrained Sparse Autoencoder (SAE) into a
reward model. SARM maps the hidden activations of LLM-based RM into an
interpretable, sparse, and monosemantic feature space, from which a scalar head
aggregates feature activations to produce transparent and conceptually
meaningful reward scores. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that SARM
facilitates direct feature-level attribution of reward assignments, allows
dynamic adjustment to preference shifts, and achieves superior alignment
performance compared to conventional reward models. Our code is available at

Conclusion: DiFac通过差异化因子一致性和辅助信息源的有效利用，解决了半监督学习中的关键问题。

Abstract: In semi-supervised learning (SSL) for enhancing the performance of graph
neural networks (GNNs) with unlabeled data, introducing mutually independent
decision factors for cross-validation is regarded as an effective strategy to
alleviate pseudo-label confirmation bias and training collapse. However,
obtaining such factors is challenging in practice: additional and valid
information sources are inherently scarce, and even when such sources are
available, their independence from the original source cannot be guaranteed. To
address this challenge, In this paper we propose a Differentiated Factor
Consistency Semi-supervised Framework (DiFac), which derives differentiated
factors from a single information source and enforces their consistency. During
pre-training, the model learns to extract these factors; in training, it
iteratively removes samples with conflicting factors and ranks pseudo-labels
based on the shortest stave principle, selecting the top candidate samples to
reduce overconfidence commonly observed in confidence-based or ensemble-based
methods. Our framework can also incorporate additional information sources. In
this work, we leverage the large multimodal language model to introduce latent
textual knowledge as auxiliary decision factors, and we design a accountability
scoring mechanism to mitigate additional erroneous judgments introduced by
these auxiliary factors. Experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate
that DiFac consistently improves robustness and generalization in low-label
regimes, outperforming other baseline methods.

Abstract: Operationalizing the EU AI Act requires clear technical documentation to
ensure AI systems are transparent, traceable, and accountable. Existing
documentation templates for AI systems do not fully cover the entire AI
lifecycle while meeting the technical documentation requirements of the AI Act.
  This paper addresses those shortcomings by introducing open-source templates
and examples for documenting data, models, and applications to provide
sufficient documentation for certifying compliance with the AI Act. These
templates track the system status over the entire AI lifecycle, ensuring
traceability, reproducibility, and compliance with the AI Act. They also
promote discoverability and collaboration, reduce risks, and align with best
practices in AI documentation and governance.
  The templates are evaluated and refined based on user feedback to enable
insights into their usability and implementability. We then validate the
approach on real-world scenarios, providing examples that further guide their
implementation: the data template is followed to document a skin tones dataset
created to support fairness evaluations of downstream computer vision models
and human-centric applications; the model template is followed to document a
neural network for segmenting human silhouettes in photos. The application
template is tested on a system deployed for construction site safety using
real-time video analytics and sensor data. Our results show that TechOps can
serve as a practical tool to enable oversight for regulatory compliance and
responsible AI development.

Abstract: In a telecommunications network, fault alarms generated by network nodes are
monitored in a Network Operations Centre (NOC) to ensure network availability
and continuous network operations. The monitoring process comprises of tasks
such as active alarms analysis, root alarm identification, and resolution of
the underlying problem. Each network node potentially can generate alarms of
different types, while nodes can be from multiple vendors, a network can have
hundreds of nodes thus resulting in an enormous volume of alarms at any time.
Since network nodes are inter-connected, a single fault in the network would
trigger multiple sequences of alarms across a variety of nodes and from a
monitoring point of view, it is a challenging task for a NOC engineer to be
aware of relations between the various alarms, when trying to identify, for
example, a root alarm on which an action needs to be taken. To effectively
identify root alarms, it is essential to learn relation among the alarms for
accurate and faster resolution. In this work we propose a novel unsupervised
alarm relation learning technique Temporal Optimization (TempOpt) that is
practical and overcomes the limitations of an existing class of alarm
relational learning method-temporal dependency methods. Experiments have been
carried on real-world network datasets, that demonstrate the improved quality
of alarm relations learned by TempOpt as compared to temporal dependency
method.

Abstract: The field of time series forecasting is rapidly advancing, with recent
large-scale Transformers and lightweight Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) models
showing strong predictive performance. However, conventional Transformer models
are often hindered by their large number of parameters and their limited
ability to capture non-stationary features in data through smoothing.
Similarly, MLP models struggle to manage multi-channel dependencies
effectively. To address these limitations, we propose a novel, lightweight time
series prediction model, WaveTS-B. This model combines wavelet transforms with
MLP to capture both periodic and non-stationary characteristics of data in the
wavelet domain. Building on this foundation, we propose a channel clustering
strategy that incorporates a Mixture of Experts (MoE) framework, utilizing a
gating mechanism and expert network to handle multi-channel dependencies
efficiently. We propose WaveTS-M, an advanced model tailored for multi-channel
time series prediction. Empirical evaluation across eight real-world time
series datasets demonstrates that our WaveTS series models achieve
state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with significantly fewer parameters.
Notably, WaveTS-M shows substantial improvements on multi-channel datasets,
highlighting its effectiveness.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成机器学习在设计中的应用受限于大数据集需求和解释性不足，本文旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 开发了系统框架生成内部同质但相互异质的输入原型，并结合贝叶斯优化解释设计空间。

Result: 通过设计流电池歧管验证了框架的有效性，能够捕捉可行设计空间并高效探索。

Conclusion: 该工作通过提升质量和可靠性，扩展了生成机器学习在系统设计中的应用范围。

Abstract: Generative machine learning has emerged as a powerful tool for design
representation and exploration. However, its application is often constrained
by the need for large datasets of existing designs and the lack of
interpretability about what features drive optimality. To address these
challenges, we introduce a systematic framework for constructing training
datasets tailored to generative models and demonstrate how these models can be
leveraged for interpretable design. The novelty of this work is twofold: (i) we
present a systematic framework for generating archetypes with internally
homogeneous but mutually heterogeneous inputs that can be used to generate a
training dataset, and (ii) we show how integrating generative models with
Bayesian optimization can enhance the interpretability of the latent space of
admissible designs. These findings are validated by using the framework to
design a flow battery manifold, demonstrating that it effectively captures the
space of feasible designs, including novel configurations while enabling
efficient exploration. This work broadens the applicability of generative
machine-learning models in system designs by enhancing quality and reliability.

TL;DR: 论文提出Oblivionis框架，解决联邦学习中LLM的遗忘问题，提升隐私合规性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习中的LLM缺乏数据遗忘机制，难以满足GDPR等隐私法规要求。

Method: 提出Oblivionis框架，结合FL和遗忘算法，实现选择性数据删除。

Result: 实验表明Oblivionis在遗忘效果与模型性能间取得平衡，优于本地训练。

Conclusion: Oblivionis为联邦LLM的隐私合规提供了有效解决方案，并指导未来研究。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly leverage Federated Learning (FL) to
utilize private, task-specific datasets for fine-tuning while preserving data
privacy. However, while federated LLM frameworks effectively enable
collaborative training without raw data sharing, they critically lack built-in
mechanisms for regulatory compliance like GDPR's right to be forgotten.
Integrating private data heightens concerns over data quality and long-term
governance, yet existing distributed training frameworks offer no principled
way to selectively remove specific client contributions post-training. Due to
distributed data silos, stringent privacy constraints, and the intricacies of
interdependent model aggregation, federated LLM unlearning is significantly
more complex than centralized LLM unlearning. To address this gap, we introduce
Oblivionis, a lightweight learning and unlearning framework that enables
clients to selectively remove specific private data during federated LLM
training, enhancing trustworthiness and regulatory compliance. By unifying FL
and unlearning as a dual optimization objective, we incorporate 6 FL and 5
unlearning algorithms for comprehensive evaluation and comparative analysis,
establishing a robust pipeline for federated LLM unlearning. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that Oblivionis outperforms local training, achieving a
robust balance between forgetting efficacy and model utility, with
cross-algorithm comparisons providing clear directions for future LLM
development.

Result: 在二元和多类分类任务中，该方法在准确率和稀疏性上优于现有技术。

Conclusion: 遗传算法是识别强彩票子网络的有效方法，同时强调了在复杂架构和任务中评估指标的重要性。

Abstract: Building modern deep learning systems that are not just effective but also
efficient requires rethinking established paradigms for model training and
neural architecture design. Instead of adapting highly overparameterized
networks and subsequently applying model compression techniques to reduce
resource consumption, a new class of high-performing networks skips the need
for expensive parameter updates, while requiring only a fraction of parameters,
making them highly scalable. The Strong Lottery Ticket Hypothesis posits that
within randomly initialized, sufficiently overparameterized neural networks,
there exist subnetworks that can match the accuracy of the trained original
model-without any training. This work explores the usage of genetic algorithms
for identifying these strong lottery ticket subnetworks. We find that for
instances of binary and multi-class classification tasks, our approach achieves
better accuracies and sparsity levels than the current state-of-the-art without
requiring any gradient information. In addition, we provide justification for
the need for appropriate evaluation metrics when scaling to more complex
network architectures and learning tasks.

Motivation: 函数空间先验能更直观地将信念嵌入模型输出，但其在BNN中的实现具有挑战性。

Method: 研究使用可训练激活函数（如Pade函数和分段线性函数）来适应高复杂度先验，并匹配复杂目标函数分布。

Result: 实验表明，即使单层宽隐层的BNN，配备灵活可训练激活函数，也能有效实现所需的函数空间先验。

Conclusion: 灵活的可训练激活函数是解决BNN中函数空间先验问题的有效方法。

Abstract: Function-space priors in Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) provide a more
intuitive approach to embedding beliefs directly into the model's output,
thereby enhancing regularization, uncertainty quantification, and risk-aware
decision-making. However, imposing function-space priors on BNNs is
challenging. We address this task through optimization techniques that explore
how trainable activations can accommodate higher-complexity priors and match
intricate target function distributions. We investigate flexible activation
models, including Pade functions and piecewise linear functions, and discuss
the learning challenges related to identifiability, loss construction, and
symmetries. Our empirical findings indicate that even BNNs with a single wide
hidden layer when equipped with flexible trainable activation, can effectively
achieve desired function-space priors.

Abstract: Causal machine learning has the potential to revolutionize decision-making by
combining the predictive power of machine learning algorithms with the theory
of causal inference. However, these methods remain underutilized by the broader
machine learning community, in part because current empirical evaluations do
not permit assessment of their reliability and robustness, undermining their
practical utility. Specifically, one of the principal criticisms made by the
community is the extensive use of synthetic experiments. We argue, on the
contrary, that synthetic experiments are essential and necessary to precisely
assess and understand the capabilities of causal machine learning methods. To
substantiate our position, we critically review the current evaluation
practices, spotlight their shortcomings, and propose a set of principles for
conducting rigorous empirical analyses with synthetic data. Adopting the
proposed principles will enable comprehensive evaluations that build trust in
causal machine learning methods, driving their broader adoption and impactful
real-world use.

Conclusion: APRNet通过解耦振幅和相位信息，显著提升了时间序列预测的准确性。

Abstract: Deep learning-based time series forecasting has found widespread
applications. Recently, converting time series data into the frequency domain
for forecasting has become popular for accurately exploring periodic patterns.
However, existing methods often cannot effectively explore stationary
information from complex intertwined frequency components. In this paper, we
propose a simple yet effective Amplitude-Phase Reconstruct Network (APRNet)
that models the inter-relationships of amplitude and phase, which prevents the
amplitude and phase from being constrained by different physical quantities,
thereby decoupling the distinct characteristics of signals for capturing
stationary information. Specifically, we represent the multivariate time series
input across sequence and channel dimensions, highlighting the correlation
between amplitude and phase at multiple interaction frequencies. We propose a
novel Kolmogorov-Arnold-Network-based Local Correlation (KLC) module to
adaptively fit local functions using univariate functions, enabling more
flexible characterization of stationary features across different amplitudes
and phases. This significantly enhances the model's capability to capture
time-varying patterns. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our
APRNet against the state-of-the-arts (SOTAs).

Result: 持续学习方法对阶段转移攻击高度脆弱，现有防御方法效果不佳。

Conclusion: 阶段转移攻击对持续学习模型构成严重安全威胁，需开发更有效的防御方法。

Abstract: Class-incremental continual learning addresses catastrophic forgetting by
enabling classification models to preserve knowledge of previously learned
classes while acquiring new ones. However, the vulnerability of the models
against adversarial attacks during this process has not been investigated
sufficiently. In this paper, we present the first exploration of vulnerability
to stage-transferred attacks, i.e., an adversarial example generated using the
model in an earlier stage is used to attack the model in a later stage. Our
findings reveal that continual learning methods are highly susceptible to these
attacks, raising a serious security issue. We explain this phenomenon through
model similarity between stages and gradual robustness degradation.
Additionally, we find that existing adversarial training-based defense methods
are not sufficiently effective to stage-transferred attacks. Codes are

Result: 在四个基准问题中，LNN-PINN显著降低了RMSE和MAE，并展示了强适应性和稳定性。

Conclusion: LNN-PINN为复杂问题中的物理信息神经网络提供了一种简洁有效的架构改进方案。

Abstract: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have attracted considerable
attention for their ability to integrate partial differential equation priors
into deep learning frameworks; however, they often exhibit limited predictive
accuracy when applied to complex problems. To address this issue, we propose
LNN-PINN, a physics-informed neural network framework that incorporates a
liquid residual gating architecture while preserving the original physics
modeling and optimization pipeline to improve predictive accuracy. The method
introduces a lightweight gating mechanism solely within the hidden-layer
mapping, keeping the sampling strategy, loss composition, and hyperparameter
settings unchanged to ensure that improvements arise purely from architectural
refinement. Across four benchmark problems, LNN-PINN consistently reduced RMSE
and MAE under identical training conditions, with absolute error plots further
confirming its accuracy gains. Moreover, the framework demonstrates strong
adaptability and stability across varying dimensions, boundary conditions, and
operator characteristics. In summary, LNN-PINN offers a concise and effective
architectural enhancement for improving the predictive accuracy of
physics-informed neural networks in complex scientific and engineering

Result: 在多个真实数据集上，GenCast显著降低了预测误差。

Conclusion: GenCast通过整合外部知识和物理约束，有效提升了无传感器区域的交通预测性能。

Abstract: Traffic forecasting is essential for intelligent transportation systems.
Accurate forecasting relies on continuous observations collected by traffic
sensors. However, due to high deployment and maintenance costs, not all regions
are equipped with such sensors. This paper aims to forecast for regions without
traffic sensors, where the lack of historical traffic observations challenges
the generalisability of existing models. We propose a model named GenCast, the
core idea of which is to exploit external knowledge to compensate for the
missing observations and to enhance generalisation. We integrate
physics-informed neural networks into GenCast, enabling physical principles to
regularise the learning process. We introduce an external signal learning
module to explore correlations between traffic states and external signals such
as weather conditions, further improving model generalisability. Additionally,
we design a spatial grouping module to filter localised features that hinder
model generalisability. Extensive experiments show that GenCast consistently
reduces forecasting errors on multiple real-world datasets.

Result: 实验表明，GRAVITY在真实数据集上表现出色，适用于传导和归纳顶点分类任务。

Conclusion: GRAVITY通过动态力场模型提升了顶点分类的准确性和语义一致性。

Abstract: In the quest of accurate vertex classification, we introduce GRAVITY
(Graph-based Representation leArning via Vertices Interaction TopologY), a
framework inspired by physical systems where objects self-organize under
attractive forces. GRAVITY models each vertex as exerting influence through
learned interactions shaped by structural proximity and attribute similarity.
These interactions induce a latent potential field in which vertices move
toward energy efficient positions, coalescing around class-consistent
attractors and distancing themselves from unrelated groups. Unlike traditional
message-passing schemes with static neighborhoods, GRAVITY adaptively modulates
the receptive field of each vertex based on a learned force function, enabling
dynamic aggregation driven by context. This field-driven organization sharpens
class boundaries and promotes semantic coherence within latent clusters.
Experiments on real-world benchmarks show that GRAVITY yields competitive
embeddings, excelling in both transductive and inductive vertex classification
tasks.

Conclusion: 频域信息在时间序列对抗攻击中具有潜力，需进一步研究。

Abstract: Transformer-based models have made significant progress in time series
forecasting. However, a key limitation of deep learning models is their
susceptibility to adversarial attacks, which has not been studied enough in the
context of time series prediction. In contrast to areas such as computer
vision, where adversarial robustness has been extensively studied, frequency
domain features of time series data play an important role in the prediction
task but have not been sufficiently explored in terms of adversarial attacks.
This paper proposes a time series prediction attack algorithm based on
frequency domain loss. Specifically, we adapt an attack method originally
designed for classification tasks to the prediction field and optimize the
adversarial samples using both time-domain and frequency-domain losses. To the
best of our knowledge, there is no relevant research on using frequency
information for time-series adversarial attacks. Our experimental results show
that these current time series prediction models are vulnerable to adversarial
attacks, and our approach achieves excellent performance on major time series
forecasting datasets.

Motivation: 注意力机制在Transformer中扮演核心角色，但其权重信息尚未被充分利用于模型解释。研究旨在探索如何将这些信息整合到XAI框架中，以增强模型的可解释性。

Method: 提出了两种新方法：1）将注意力权重整合到Shapley值分解中，用于局部解释；2）将注意力权重与概念激活向量结合，用于全局解释。

Result: 实验表明，注意力权重可以有效地整合到XAI框架中，显著提升了Transformer模型的可解释性。

Conclusion: 注意力权重为Transformer模型提供了有价值的解释信息，能够丰富现有的XAI技术。

Abstract: The attention mechanism lies at the core of the transformer architecture,
providing an interpretable model-internal signal that has motivated a growing
interest in attention-based model explanations. Although attention weights do
not directly determine model outputs, they reflect patterns of token influence
that can inform and complement established explainability techniques. This work
studies the potential of utilising the information encoded in attention weights
to provide meaningful model explanations by integrating them into explainable
AI (XAI) frameworks that target fundamentally different aspects of model
behaviour. To this end, we develop two novel explanation methods applicable to
both natural language processing and computer vision tasks. The first
integrates attention weights into the Shapley value decomposition by redefining
the characteristic function in terms of pairwise token interactions via
attention weights, thus adapting this widely used game-theoretic solution
concept to provide attention-driven attributions for local explanations. The
second incorporates attention weights into token-level directional derivatives
defined through concept activation vectors to measure concept sensitivity for
global explanations. Our empirical evaluations on standard benchmarks and in a
comparison study with widely used explanation methods show that attention
weights can be meaningfully incorporated into the studied XAI frameworks,
highlighting their value in enriching transformer explainability.

Conclusion: 论文提出的策略在真实数据集上验证了其优越性，尤其适合资源受限设备部署。

Abstract: This work focuses on Hierarchical Inference (HI) in edge intelligence
systems, where a compact Local-ML model on an end-device works in conjunction
with a high-accuracy Remote-ML model on an edge-server. HI aims to reduce
latency, improve accuracy, and lower bandwidth usage by first using the
Local-ML model for inference and offloading to the Remote-ML only when the
local inference is likely incorrect. A critical challenge in HI is estimating
the likelihood of the local inference being incorrect, especially when data
distributions and offloading costs change over time -- a problem we term
Hierarchical Inference Learning (HIL). We introduce a novel approach to HIL by
modeling the probability of correct inference by the Local-ML as an increasing
function of the model's confidence measure, a structure motivated by empirical
observations but previously unexploited. We propose two policies, HI-LCB and
HI-LCB-lite, based on the Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) framework. We
demonstrate that both policies achieve order-optimal regret of $O(\log T)$, a
significant improvement over existing HIL policies with $O(T^{2/3})$ regret
guarantees. Notably, HI-LCB-lite has an $O(1)$ per-sample computational
complexity, making it well-suited for deployment on devices with severe
resource limitations. Simulations using real-world datasets confirm that our
policies outperform existing state-of-the-art HIL methods.

Abstract: Designing mechanical mechanisms to trace specific paths is a classic yet
notoriously difficult engineering problem, characterized by a vast and complex
search space of discrete topologies and continuous parameters. We introduce
MechaFormer, a Transformer-based model that tackles this challenge by treating
mechanism design as a conditional sequence generation task. Our model learns to
translate a target curve into a domain-specific language (DSL) string,
simultaneously determining the mechanism's topology and geometric parameters in
a single, unified process. MechaFormer significantly outperforms existing
baselines, achieving state-of-the-art path-matching accuracy and generating a
wide diversity of novel and valid designs. We demonstrate a suite of sampling
strategies that can dramatically improve solution quality and offer designers
valuable flexibility. Furthermore, we show that the high-quality outputs from
MechaFormer serve as excellent starting points for traditional optimizers,
creating a hybrid approach that finds superior solutions with remarkable
efficiency.

Method: 使用550个真实网络基准，比较了四种堆叠算法、42种拓扑链接预测器和两种图神经网络算法，并引入了元学习算法。

Result: 结果显示，不同算法在不同网络中表现各异，堆叠模型在AUC上表现优异，而图神经网络在Top-k上竞争力强。网络特性（如度分布）对性能影响显著。

Conclusion: 元学习算法能根据网络特性选择最佳算法，显著优于现有技术，并具有可扩展性。

Abstract: Relational data are ubiquitous in real-world data applications, e.g., in
social network analysis or biological modeling, but networks are nearly always
incompletely observed. The state-of-the-art for predicting missing links in the
hard case of a network without node attributes uses model stacking or neural
network techniques. It remains unknown which approach is best, and whether or
how the best choice of algorithm depends on the input network's
characteristics. We answer these questions systematically using a large,
structurally diverse benchmark of 550 real-world networks under two standard
accuracy measures (AUC and Top-k), comparing four stacking algorithms with 42
topological link predictors, two of which we introduce here, and two graph
neural network algorithms. We show that no algorithm is best across all input
networks, all algorithms perform well on most social networks, and few perform
well on economic and biological networks. Overall, model stacking with a random
forest is both highly scalable and surpasses on AUC or is competitive with
graph neural networks on Top-k accuracy. But, algorithm performance depends
strongly on network characteristics like the degree distribution, triangle
density, and degree assortativity. We introduce a meta-learning algorithm that
exploits this variability to optimize link predictions for individual networks
by selecting the best algorithm to apply, which we show outperforms all
state-of-the-art algorithms and scales to large networks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决主动测试在大型模型评估中计算成本高的问题。

Method: 使用上下文学习构建低成本代理模型，无需更新，且可小于目标模型；引入单次运行误差估计器。

Result: 方法能更有效地评估LLM性能，数据需求低于现有标准。

Conclusion: 主动测试可扩展至LLM评估，显著降低计算成本和数据需求。

Abstract: Active testing enables label-efficient evaluation of models through careful
data acquisition. However, its significant computational costs have previously
undermined its use for large models. We show how it can be successfully scaled
up to the evaluation of large language models (LLMs). In particular we show
that the surrogate model used to guide data acquisition can be constructed
cheaply using in-context learning, does not require updating within an
active-testing loop, and can be smaller than the target model. We even find we
can make good data-acquisition decisions without computing predictions with the
target model and further introduce a single-run error estimator to asses how
well active testing is working on the fly. We find that our approach is able to
more effectively evaluate LLM performance with less data than current standard
practices.

TL;DR: Chi-Geometry是一个生成图数据的库，用于测试和评估GNN预测手性的能力，支持生成具有特定几何和拓扑特征的合成图样本，并用于设计新的GNN架构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了更可解释且减少混淆地评估GNN在手性预测任务中的表现，并指导设计性能更好的GNN架构。

Method: 生成包含一个手性中心（标记为R或S）的合成图样本，结合成数据集用于节点分类任务，并用于评估SOTA GNN架构。

Result: 通过Chi-Geometry生成的数据集评估了多种SOTA GNN架构，并设计出两种新架构：一种通过全连接提高准确性但计算成本高，另一种通过虚拟节点保持线性计算成本且保持高准确性。

Conclusion: Chi-Geometry为GNN手性预测提供了有效的评估工具，并成功指导了两种新GNN架构的设计，分别解决了计算成本和准确性的问题。

Abstract: We introduce Chi-Geometry - a library that generates graph data for testing
and benchmarking GNNs' ability to predict chirality. Chi-Geometry generates
synthetic graph samples with (i) user-specified geometric and topological
traits to isolate certain types of samples and (ii) randomized node positions
and species to minimize extraneous correlations. Each generated graph contains
exactly one chiral center labeled either R or S, while all other nodes are
labeled N/A (non-chiral). The generated samples are then combined into a
cohesive dataset that can be used to assess a GNN's ability to predict
chirality as a node classification task. Chi-Geometry allows more interpretable
and less confounding benchmarking of GNNs for prediction of chirality in the
graph samples which can guide the design of new GNN architectures with improved
predictive performance. We illustrate Chi-Geometry's efficacy by using it to
generate synthetic datasets for benchmarking various state-of-the-art (SOTA)
GNN architectures. The conclusions of these benchmarking results guided our
design of two new GNN architectures. The first GNN architecture established
all-to-all connections in the graph to accurately predict chirality across all
challenging configurations where previously tested SOTA models failed, but at a
computational cost (both for training and inference) that grows quadratically
with the number of graph nodes. The second GNN architecture avoids all-to-all
connections by introducing a virtual node in the original graph structure of
the data, which restores the linear scaling of training and inference
computational cost with respect to the number of nodes in the graph, while
still ensuring competitive accuracy in detecting chirality with respect to SOTA
GNN architectures.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合自然语言推理和形式化语言的方法（GF-Reasoner），通过链式思维（CoT）和形式化代码的交替生成，提升几何问题求解（GPS）的准确性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大型视觉语言模型在几何问题求解中表现不佳，主要因为其不可靠的图表解释和纯自然语言推理能力。直接生成形式化程序的方法缺乏中间推理，导致决策过程不透明且易出错。

Method: 结合链式思维（CoT）与形式化语言，交替生成自然语言推理和可执行代码。通过监督微调（11K合成数据集）和基于求解器的强化学习优化推理过程和程序生成。

Result: GF-Reasoner在标准GPS基准测试中提升了15%的准确率，优于7B规模模型及更大的Qwen2.5-VL-72B模型，生成的推理轨迹更短且清晰。

Conclusion: 该方法通过结合自然语言和形式化语言，显著提升了几何问题求解的准确性和可解释性，为未来研究提供了设计选择的详细分析。

Abstract: Large vision language models exhibit notable limitations on Geometry Problem
Solving (GPS) because of their unreliable diagram interpretation and pure
natural-language reasoning. A recent line of work mitigates this by using
symbolic solvers: the model directly generates a formal program that a geometry
solver can execute. However, this direct program generation lacks intermediate
reasoning, making the decision process opaque and prone to errors. In this
work, we explore a new approach that integrates Chain-of-Thought (CoT) with
formal language. The model interleaves natural language reasoning with
incremental emission of solver-executable code, producing a hybrid reasoning
trace in which critical derivations are expressed in formal language. To teach
this behavior at scale, we combine (1) supervised fine-tuning on an 11K newly
developed synthetic dataset with interleaved natural language reasoning and
automatic formalization, and (2) solver-in-the-loop reinforcement learning that
jointly optimizes both the CoT narrative and the resulting program through
outcome-based rewards. Built on Qwen2.5-VL-7B, our new model, named
GF-Reasoner, achieves up to 15% accuracy improvements on standard GPS
benchmarks, surpassing both 7B-scale peers and the much larger model
Qwen2.5-VL-72B. By exploiting high-order geometric knowledge and offloading
symbolic computation to the solver, the generated reasoning traces are
noticeably shorter and cleaner. Furthermore, we present a comprehensive
analysis of method design choices (e.g., reasoning paradigms, data synthesis,
training epochs, etc.), providing actionable insights for future research.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ASPIRE是一种通用的神经推理模型，用于处理异构结构化数据的语义推理和预测，支持跨数据集的特征依赖学习，并能适应新的推理任务而无需额外调整。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界数据通常具有多样化和不连贯的形式（如不同的模式、不一致的语义和无固定特征顺序），这使得构建能够跨数据集利用信息的通用模型具有挑战性。

Method: ASPIRE结合了基于集合的、排列不变的Transformer和语义接地模块，通过自然语言描述、数据集元数据和上下文示例来学习跨数据集特征依赖关系。

Result: ASPIRE在多样化基准测试中表现优异，并支持在开放世界设置中成本感知的主动特征获取。

Conclusion: ASPIRE是实现真正通用的、语义感知的结构化数据推理的重要一步。

Abstract: Real-world data often appears in diverse, disjoint forms -- with varying
schemas, inconsistent semantics, and no fixed feature ordering -- making it
challenging to build general-purpose models that can leverage information
across datasets. We introduce ASPIRE, Arbitrary Set-based Permutation-Invariant
Reasoning Engine, a Universal Neural Inference model for semantic reasoning and
prediction over heterogeneous structured data. ASPIRE combines a
permutation-invariant, set-based Transformer with a semantic grounding module
that incorporates natural language descriptions, dataset metadata, and
in-context examples to learn cross-dataset feature dependencies. This
architecture allows ASPIRE to ingest arbitrary sets of feature--value pairs and
support examples, align semantics across disjoint tables, and make predictions
for any specified target. Once trained, ASPIRE generalizes to new inference
tasks without additional tuning. In addition to delivering strong results
across diverse benchmarks, ASPIRE naturally supports cost-aware active feature
acquisition in an open-world setting, selecting informative features under
test-time budget constraints for an arbitrary unseen dataset. These
capabilities position ASPIRE as a step toward truly universal, semantics-aware
inference over structured data.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度神经网络在安全关键场景（如自动驾驶和医疗）中因校准不佳可能导致严重后果，现有方法对欠置信引起的校准误差关注不足。

Method: 采用两阶段训练方案和自适应稀疏性，动态调整掩码保留率以匹配置信度与准确性偏差。

Result: 实验表明MaC-Cal在校准性能和数据损坏下的鲁棒性上表现优异。

Conclusion: MaC-Cal为深度神经网络提供了可靠置信度估计的实用有效解决方案。

Abstract: In recent years, deep neural networks (DNNs) have shown competitive results
in many fields. Despite this success, they often suffer from poor calibration,
especially in safety-critical scenarios such as autonomous driving and
healthcare, where unreliable confidence estimates can lead to serious
consequences. Recent studies have focused on improving calibration by modifying
the classifier, yet such efforts remain limited. Moreover, most existing
approaches overlook calibration errors caused by underconfidence, which can be
equally detrimental. To address these challenges, we propose MaC-Cal, a novel
mask-based classifier calibration method that leverages stochastic sparsity to
enhance the alignment between confidence and accuracy. MaC-Cal adopts a
two-stage training scheme with adaptive sparsity, dynamically adjusting mask
retention rates based on the deviation between confidence and accuracy.
Extensive experiments show that MaC-Cal achieves superior calibration
performance and robustness under data corruption, offering a practical and
effective solution for reliable confidence estimation in DNNs.

Conclusion: UGM2N在网格自适应中实现了方程无关的泛化和几何独立性，优于现有方法。

Abstract: Partial differential equations (PDEs) form the mathematical foundation for
modeling physical systems in science and engineering, where numerical solutions
demand rigorous accuracy-efficiency tradeoffs. Mesh movement techniques address
this challenge by dynamically relocating mesh nodes to rapidly-varying regions,
enhancing both simulation accuracy and computational efficiency. However,
traditional approaches suffer from high computational complexity and geometric
inflexibility, limiting their applicability, and existing supervised
learning-based approaches face challenges in zero-shot generalization across
diverse PDEs and mesh topologies.In this paper, we present an Unsupervised and
Generalizable Mesh Movement Network (UGM2N). We first introduce unsupervised
mesh adaptation through localized geometric feature learning, eliminating the
dependency on pre-adapted meshes. We then develop a physics-constrained loss
function, M-Uniform loss, that enforces mesh equidistribution at the nodal
level.Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed network exhibits
equation-agnostic generalization and geometric independence in efficient mesh
adaptation. It demonstrates consistent superiority over existing methods,
including robust performance across diverse PDEs and mesh geometries,
scalability to multi-scale resolutions and guaranteed error reduction without
mesh tangling.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于拓扑理论的新型分类生成AI架构（GAIAs），利用范畴论中的通用构造构建了新的LLM架构。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM研究主要关注线性架构或专家混合模型，本文旨在探索基于范畴论的新型组合结构，以提升LLM的表达能力。

Method: 利用范畴论中的通用性质（如拉回、推出、指数对象等）构建新的LLM架构，并通过理论验证LLM范畴的完备性和拓扑性质。

Result: 证明了LLM范畴具有完备性，并形成一个拓扑（“类集合”范畴），为新型架构提供了理论基础。

Conclusion: 通过范畴论的工具，论文为LLM设计提供了新的理论框架和实现路径。

Abstract: We propose the design of novel categorical generative AI architectures
(GAIAs) using topos theory, a type of category that is ``set-like": a topos has
all (co)limits, is Cartesian closed, and has a subobject classifier. Previous
theoretical results on the Transformer model have shown that it is a universal
sequence-to-sequence function approximator, and dense in the space of all
continuous functions with compact support on the Euclidean space of embeddings
of tokens. Building on this theoretical result, we explore novel architectures
for LLMs that exploit the property that the category of LLMs, viewed as
functions, forms a topos. Previous studies of large language models (LLMs) have
focused on daisy-chained linear architectures or mixture-of-experts. In this
paper, we use universal constructions in category theory to construct novel LLM
architectures based on new types of compositional structures. In particular,
these new compositional structures are derived from universal properties of LLM
categories, and include pullback, pushout, (co) equalizers, exponential
objects, and subobject classifiers. We theoretically validate these new
compositional structures by showing that the category of LLMs is (co)complete,
meaning that all diagrams have solutions in the form of (co)limits. Building on
this completeness result, we then show that the category of LLMs forms a topos,
a ``set-like" category, which requires showing the existence of exponential
objects as well as subobject classifiers. We use a functorial characterization
of backpropagation to define a potential implementation of an LLM topos
architecture.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的因果模型类别——拓扑因果模型（TCMs），利用拓扑范畴的关键性质（如完备性、子对象分类器和指数对象），展示了这些性质在因果推断中的重要性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在通过拓扑范畴的性质（如完备性和子对象分类器）为因果推断提供更强大的数学工具，解决复杂因果图的建模和近似问题。

Method: 定义TCMs为一组函数，每个函数定义一个局部因果机制，组合成全局函数。利用拓扑范畴的完备性证明因果图可通过（共）极限求解。

Result: 证明了TCMs的完备性，展示了如何用子对象分类器建模因果干预，以及如何用指数对象推理因果等价类。

Conclusion: TCMs为因果推断提供了强大的数学框架，支持复杂因果图的建模、干预和逻辑推理。

Abstract: We propose topos causal models (TCMs), a novel class of causal models that
exploit the key properties of a topos category: they are (co)complete, meaning
all (co)limits exist, they admit a subobject classifier, and allow exponential
objects. The main goal of this paper is to show that these properties are
central to many applications in causal inference. For example, subobject
classifiers allow a categorical formulation of causal intervention, which
creates sub-models. Limits and colimits allow causal diagrams of arbitrary
complexity to be ``solved", using a novel interpretation of causal
approximation. Exponential objects enable reasoning about equivalence classes
of operations on causal models, such as covered edge reversal and causal
homotopy. Analogous to structural causal models (SCMs), TCMs are defined by a
collection of functions, each defining a ``local autonomous" causal mechanism
that assemble to induce a unique global function from exogenous to endogenous
variables. Since the category of TCMs is (co)complete, which we prove in this
paper, every causal diagram has a ``solution" in the form of a (co)limit: this
implies that any arbitrary causal model can be ``approximated" by some global
function with respect to the morphisms going into or out of the diagram.
Natural transformations are crucial in measuring the quality of approximation.
In addition, we show that causal interventions are modeled by subobject
classifiers: any sub-model is defined by a monic arrow into its parent model.
Exponential objects permit reasoning about entire classes of causal
equivalences and interventions. Finally, as TCMs form a topos, they admit an
internal logic defined as a Mitchell-Benabou language with an associated
Kripke-Joyal semantics. We show how to reason about causal models in TCMs using
this internal logic.

Result: 在带时间窗的多目标车辆路径问题基准实例上，该方法能在短时间内产生良好结果。

Conclusion: 该方法结合了多目标算法的有效性和目标规划的高效性，适用于适应度景观相似的问题场景。

Abstract: Many real-world applications require decision-makers to assess the quality of
solutions while considering multiple conflicting objectives. Obtaining good
approximation sets for highly constrained many-objective problems is often a
difficult task even for modern multiobjective algorithms. In some cases,
multiple instances of the problem scenario present similarities in their
fitness landscapes. That is, there are recurring features in the fitness
landscapes when searching for solutions to different problem instances. We
propose a methodology to exploit this characteristic by solving one instance of
a given problem scenario using computationally expensive multiobjective
algorithms to obtain a good approximation set and then using Goal Programming
with efficient single-objective algorithms to solve other instances of the same
problem scenario. We use three goal-based objective functions and show that on
benchmark instances of the multiobjective vehicle routing problem with time
windows, the methodology is able to produce good results in short computation
time. The methodology allows to combine the effectiveness of state-of-the-art
multiobjective algorithms with the efficiency of goal programming to find good
compromise solutions in problem scenarios where instances have similar fitness
landscapes.

Conclusion: LLM在贝叶斯建模中具有自动化潜力，为概率编程的自动化推断流程提供了可能性。

Abstract: A significant barrier to the widespread adoption of Bayesian inference is the
specification of prior distributions and likelihoods, which often requires
specialized statistical expertise. This paper investigates the feasibility of
using a Large Language Model (LLM) to automate this process. We introduce
LLM-BI (Large Language Model-driven Bayesian Inference), a conceptual pipeline
for automating Bayesian workflows. As a proof-of-concept, we present two
experiments focused on Bayesian linear regression. In Experiment I, we
demonstrate that an LLM can successfully elicit prior distributions from
natural language. In Experiment II, we show that an LLM can specify the entire
model structure, including both priors and the likelihood, from a single
high-level problem description. Our results validate the potential of LLMs to
automate key steps in Bayesian modeling, enabling the possibility of an
automated inference pipeline for probabilistic programming.

Motivation: 解决LLMs在用户信息不完整时回答不准确的问题。

Method: 提出FATA范式，通过提示词引导LLMs生成补充问题，整合用户信息后生成回答。

Result: FATA在综合指标上优于基线提示40%，稳定性优于上下文增强提示。

Conclusion: FATA通过用户参与和单轮策略，显著提升了LLMs的回答效果。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle to deliver accurate and
actionable answers when user-provided information is incomplete or
ill-specified. We propose a new interaction paradigm, First Ask Then Answer
(FATA), in which, through prompt words, LLMs are guided to proactively generate
multidimensional supplementary questions for users prior to response
generation. Subsequently, by integrating user-provided supplementary
information with the original query through sophisticated prompting techniques,
we achieve substantially improved response quality and relevance. In contrast
to existing clarification approaches -- such as the CLAM framework oriented to
ambiguity and the self-interrogation Self-Ask method -- FATA emphasizes
completeness (beyond mere disambiguation) and user participation (inviting
human input instead of relying solely on model-internal reasoning). It also
adopts a single-turn strategy: all clarifying questions are produced at once,
thereby reducing dialogue length and improving efficiency. Conceptually, FATA
uses the reasoning power of LLMs to scaffold user expression, enabling
non-expert users to formulate more comprehensive and contextually relevant
queries. To evaluate FATA, we constructed a multi-domain benchmark and compared
it with two controls: a baseline prompt (B-Prompt) and a context-enhanced
expert prompt (C-Prompt). Experimental results show that FATA outperforms
B-Prompt by approximately 40% in aggregate metrics and exhibits a coefficient
of variation 8% lower than C-Prompt, indicating superior stability.

Motivation: 现有评估方法无法区分模型是推理还是直接检索答案，且评估指标不一致，掩盖了有意义的比较。

Method: 引入了一种构建基准和评估协议的系统方法，用于评估知识不完整时的KG-RAG方法。

Result: 实验表明，当前KG-RAG方法在知识缺失时推理能力有限，依赖内部记忆，且泛化能力因设计而异。

Conclusion: 需要改进KG-RAG方法的推理能力，并采用更严格的评估标准。

Abstract: Knowledge Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (KG-RAG) is an
increasingly explored approach for combining the reasoning capabilities of
large language models with the structured evidence of knowledge graphs.
However, current evaluation practices fall short: existing benchmarks often
include questions that can be directly answered using existing triples in KG,
making it unclear whether models perform reasoning or simply retrieve answers
directly. Moreover, inconsistent evaluation metrics and lenient answer matching
criteria further obscure meaningful comparisons. In this work, we introduce a
general method for constructing benchmarks, together with an evaluation
protocol, to systematically assess KG-RAG methods under knowledge
incompleteness. Our empirical results show that current KG-RAG methods have
limited reasoning ability under missing knowledge, often rely on internal
memorization, and exhibit varying degrees of generalization depending on their
design.

Motivation: 解决现有AI在集换式卡牌游戏中表现不佳的问题，特别是在选牌和游戏玩法方面。

Method: 使用低秩适应（LoRA）微调开放权重的大型语言模型，基于标注的选牌日志数据集。

Result: UrzaGPT在微调后达到66.2%的准确率，优于零样本LLM，但未达到领域专用模型的水平。

Conclusion: LLM可用于构建高效、通用且易于更新的选牌AI。

Abstract: Collectible card games (CCGs) are a difficult genre for AI due to their
partial observability, long-term decision-making, and evolving card sets. Due
to this, current AI models perform vastly worse than human players at CCG tasks
such as deckbuilding and gameplay. In this work, we introduce UrzaGPT, a
domain-adapted large language model that recommends real-time drafting
decisions in Magic: The Gathering. Starting from an open-weight LLM, we use
Low-Rank Adaptation fine-tuning on a dataset of annotated draft logs. With
this, we leverage the language modeling capabilities of LLM, and can quickly
adapt to different expansions of the game. We benchmark UrzaGPT in comparison
to zero-shot LLMs and the state-of-the-art domain-specific model. Untuned,
small LLMs like Llama-3-8B are completely unable to draft, but the larger
GPT-4o achieves a zero-shot performance of 43%. Using UrzaGPT to fine-tune
smaller models, we achieve an accuracy of 66.2% using only 10,000 steps.
Despite this not reaching the capability of domain-specific models, we show
that solely using LLMs to draft is possible and conclude that using LLMs can
enable performant, general, and update-friendly drafting AIs in the future.

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了MCTS在经典规划中的效率问题，为类似问题提供了新思路。

Abstract: We study an efficient implementation of Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB)-based
Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) for classical planning. One weakness of MCTS is
that it spends a significant time deciding which node to expand next. While
selecting a node from an OPEN list with $N$ nodes has $O(1)$ runtime complexity
with traditional array-based priority-queues for dense integer keys, the
tree-based OPEN list used by MCTS requires $O(\log N)$, which roughly
corresponds to the search depth $d$. In classical planning, $d$ is arbitrarily
large (e.g., $2^k-1$ in $k$-disk Tower-of-Hanoi) and the runtime for node
selection is significant, unlike in game tree search, where the cost is
negligible compared to the node evaluation (rollouts) because $d$ is inherently
limited by the game (e.g., $d\leq 361$ in Go). To improve this bottleneck, we
propose a bilevel modification to MCTS that runs a best-first search from each
selected leaf node with an expansion budget proportional to $d$, which achieves
amortized $O(1)$ runtime for node selection, equivalent to the traditional
queue-based OPEN list. In addition, we introduce Tree Collapsing, an
enhancement that reduces action selection steps and further improves the
performance.

*Niklas Dewally,Özgür Akgün*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出一种避免完全枚举的方法，通过求解器仅计算生成最终约束所需的组合，显著提高编译效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法在编译过程中会生成所有组合并通过部分求值丢弃无关项，对于大多数组合无关的问题效率低下。

Method: 利用求解器仅计算生成最终约束所需的组合，避免完全枚举。

Result: 生成的模型与传统方法相同，但编译速度显著提升。

Conclusion: 该方法特别适用于变量域大且有选择性前提条件的问题，提高了模型转换效率。

Abstract: Constraint modelling languages like MiniZinc and Essence rely on unrolling
loops (in the form of quantified expressions and comprehensions) during
compilation. Standard approaches generate all combinations of induction
variables and use partial evaluation to discard those that simplify to identity
elements of associative-commutative operators (e.g. true for conjunction, 0 for
summation). This can be inefficient for problems where most combinations are
ultimately irrelevant. We present a method that avoids full enumeration by
using a solver to compute only the combinations required to generate the final
set of constraints. The resulting model is identical to that produced by
conventional flattening, but compilation can be significantly faster. This
improves the efficiency of translating high-level user models into solver-ready
form, particularly when induction variables range over large domains with
selective preconditions.

*Woojeong Kim,Junxiong Wang,Jing Nathan Yan,Mohamed Abdelfattah,Alexander M. Rush*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: OverFill通过解耦预填充和解码阶段优化LLM推理效率，提升生成质量且延迟增加极小。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLM）推理成本高，解码阶段延迟显著，现有模型未区分预填充和解码的计算特性。

Method: OverFill在预填充阶段使用完整模型并行处理输入，解码阶段切换为密集剪枝模型顺序生成令牌。

Result: 3B-to-1B配置比1B剪枝模型性能提升83.2%，8B-to-3B配置比3B剪枝模型提升79.2%。

Conclusion: OverFill在保持性能的同时显著减少训练数据需求，代码已开源。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel across diverse tasks but face significant
deployment challenges due to high inference costs. LLM inference comprises
prefill (compute-bound) and decode (memory-bound) stages, with decode
dominating latency particularly for long sequences. Current decoder-only models
handle both stages uniformly, despite their distinct computational profiles. We
propose OverFill, which decouples these stages to optimize accuracy-efficiency
tradeoffs. OverFill begins with a full model for prefill, processing system and
user inputs in parallel. It then switches to a dense pruned model, while
generating tokens sequentially. Leveraging more compute during prefill,
OverFill improves generation quality with minimal latency overhead. Our
3B-to-1B OverFill configuration outperforms 1B pruned models by 83.2%, while
the 8B-to-3B configuration improves over 3B pruned models by 79.2% on average
across standard benchmarks. OverFill matches the performance of same-sized
models trained from scratch, while using significantly less training data. Our
code is available at https://github.com/friendshipkim/overfill.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于GRASP的元启发式算法，用于解决动态弧成本的触发弧旅行商问题（TA-TSP），在MESS 2024竞赛中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: TA-TSP扩展了经典TSP，引入了动态弧成本，适用于仓库操作等场景。

Method: 结合多种构造启发式和多邻域局部搜索，使用MIP技术将TA-TSP转化为一系列定制TSP实例，并应用2-Opt、Swap和Relocate操作。

Result: 在60秒内，平均最优性差距为0.77%和0.40%，在合成数据集上比Gurobi求解器优11.3%。

Conclusion: 算法在MESS 2024中排名前三，适用于实时路由应用。

Abstract: The Trigger Arc Traveling Salesman Problem (TA-TSP) extends the classical TSP
by introducing dynamic arc costs that change when specific \textit{trigger}
arcs are traversed, modeling scenarios such as warehouse operations with
compactable storage systems. This paper introduces a GRASP-based metaheuristic
that combines multiple construction heuristics with a multi-neighborhood local
search. The construction phase uses mixed-integer programming (MIP) techniques
to transform the TA-TSP into a sequence of tailored TSP instances, while the
improvement phase applies 2-Opt, Swap, and Relocate operators. Computational
experiments on MESS 2024 competition instances achieved average optimality gaps
of 0.77\% and 0.40\% relative to the best-known solutions within a 60-second
limit. On smaller, synthetically generated datasets, the method produced
solutions 11.3\% better than the Gurobi solver under the same time constraints.
The algorithm finished in the top three at MESS 2024, demonstrating its
suitability for real-time routing applications with state-dependent travel
costs.

TL;DR: 论文指出基于序数比较的LLM对齐方法存在根本性限制，无法系统恢复最优模型，提出使用基数反馈（如支付意愿）改进偏好微调，实验证明其优于序数方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM对齐技术依赖序数偏好数据，但这类数据无法解决模型间的权衡问题，导致无法系统恢复最优模型。

Method: 提出使用基数反馈（支付意愿）收集25,000条数据，改进偏好微调方法。

Result: 实验表明，基数反馈方法能优先处理高影响力改进，在Arena-Hard等基准上优于序数方法。

Conclusion: 基数反馈是解决LLM对齐中偏好数据局限性的有效方法，优于传统序数比较。

Abstract: Alignment techniques for LLMs rely on optimizing preference-based objectives
-- where these preferences are typically elicited as ordinal, binary choices
between responses. Recent work has focused on improving label quality or
mitigating particular biases, but we identify a more fundamental limitation:
these methods collect the wrong kind of data. We prove an impossibility result:
no algorithm relying solely on ordinal comparisons can systematically recover
the most preferred model. Intuitively, ordinal data lacks the information
needed to resolve tradeoffs -- e.g., fixing a factual error on one prompt
versus improving style on another. We show that selecting the optimal model
requires recovering preferences over \emph{models} (rather than just
responses), which can only be identified given cardinal feedback about response
quality. To address this, we collect and publicly release a dataset of 25,000
cardinal judgments using willingness-to-pay elicitations, a well-established
tool from experimental economics. Empirically, we find that incorporating
cardinal feedback into preference fine-tuning allows models to prioritize
high-impact improvements and outperform ordinal-only methods on downstream
benchmarks, such as Arena-Hard.

Abstract: In recent years, reinforcement learning (RL) methods have emerged as a
promising approach for solving combinatorial problems. Among RL-based models,
POMO has demonstrated strong performance on a variety of tasks, including
variants of the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP). However, there is room for
improvement for these tasks. In this work, we improved POMO, creating a method
(\textbf{POMO+}) that leverages the initial nodes to find a solution in a more
informed way. We ran experiments on our new model and observed that our
solution converges faster and achieves better results. We validated our models
on the CVRPLIB dataset and noticed improvements in problem instances with up to
100 customers. We hope that our research in this project can lead to further
advancements in the field.

Result: LLM在验证不确定对齐时表现良好，与模拟Oracle的性能进行了对比。

Conclusion: LLM可作为替代领域专家的可行方案，尤其适用于验证不确定的对齐部分。

Abstract: Ontology alignment plays a crucial role in integrating diverse data sources
across domains. There is a large plethora of systems that tackle the ontology
alignment problem, yet challenges persist in producing highly quality
correspondences among a set of input ontologies. Human-in-the-loop during the
alignment process is essential in applications requiring very accurate
mappings. User involvement is, however, expensive when dealing with large
ontologies. In this paper, we explore the feasibility of using Large Language
Models (LLM) as an alternative to the domain expert. The use of the LLM focuses
only on the validation of the subset of correspondences where an ontology
alignment system is very uncertain. We have conducted an extensive evaluation
over several matching tasks of the Ontology Alignment Evaluation Initiative
(OAEI), analysing the performance of several state-of-the-art LLMs using
different ontology-driven prompt templates. The LLM results are also compared
against simulated Oracles with variable error rates.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM基准测试大多未涵盖多样化的任务，GVGAI-LLM旨在填补这一空白，通过游戏场景测试模型的通用能力。

Method: 基于General Video Game AI框架，使用游戏描述语言快速生成新游戏和关卡，避免过拟合。游戏场景以ASCII字符表示，便于语言模型处理。

Result: 零样本评估显示LLMs在空间推理和基础规划方面存在明显不足，结构化提示和空间接地技术仅带来部分改进。

Conclusion: GVGAI-LLM为语言模型能力研究提供了可复现的测试平台，尤其关注代理行为和上下文推理。

Abstract: We introduce GVGAI-LLM, a video game benchmark for evaluating the reasoning
and problem-solving capabilities of large language models (LLMs). Built on the
General Video Game AI framework, it features a diverse collection of
arcade-style games designed to test a model's ability to handle tasks that
differ from most existing LLM benchmarks. The benchmark leverages a game
description language that enables rapid creation of new games and levels,
helping to prevent overfitting over time. Each game scene is represented by a
compact set of ASCII characters, allowing for efficient processing by language
models. GVGAI-LLM defines interpretable metrics, including the meaningful step
ratio, step efficiency, and overall score, to assess model behavior. Through
zero-shot evaluations across a broad set of games and levels with diverse
challenges and skill depth, we reveal persistent limitations of LLMs in spatial
reasoning and basic planning. Current models consistently exhibit spatial and
logical errors, motivating structured prompting and spatial grounding
techniques. While these interventions lead to partial improvements, the
benchmark remains very far from solved. GVGAI-LLM provides a reproducible
testbed for advancing research on language model capabilities, with a
particular emphasis on agentic behavior and contextual reasoning.

TL;DR: SynLLM是一个模块化框架，利用20种开源LLM生成高质量医疗合成数据，通过结构化提示和全面评估框架解决隐私和临床有效性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实医疗数据因隐私法规受限，阻碍研究进展，合成数据成为替代方案，但现有方法缺乏系统提示策略和多维评估。

Method: 提出SynLLM框架，使用20种开源LLM（如LLaMA、Mistral等），设计四种提示类型（如规则约束），无需微调即可控制生成。

Result: 在三个医疗数据集上评估，规则提示在隐私与质量平衡上表现最佳，LLM能生成临床合理且隐私保护的合成数据。

Conclusion: SynLLM证明，通过精心设计的提示和全面评估，LLM可生成高质量医疗合成数据，推动更安全的数据共享。

Abstract: Access to real-world medical data is often restricted due to privacy
regulations, posing a significant barrier to the advancement of healthcare
research. Synthetic data offers a promising alternative; however, generating
realistic, clinically valid, and privacy-conscious records remains a major
challenge. Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) offer new
opportunities for structured data generation; however, existing approaches
frequently lack systematic prompting strategies and comprehensive,
multi-dimensional evaluation frameworks.
  In this paper, we present SynLLM, a modular framework for generating
high-quality synthetic medical tabular data using 20 state-of-the-art
open-source LLMs, including LLaMA, Mistral, and GPT variants, guided by
structured prompts. We propose four distinct prompt types, ranging from
example-driven to rule-based constraints, that encode schema, metadata, and
domain knowledge to control generation without model fine-tuning. Our framework
features a comprehensive evaluation pipeline that rigorously assesses generated
data across statistical fidelity, clinical consistency, and privacy
preservation.
  We evaluate SynLLM across three public medical datasets, including Diabetes,
Cirrhosis, and Stroke, using 20 open-source LLMs. Our results show that prompt
engineering significantly impacts data quality and privacy risk, with
rule-based prompts achieving the best privacy-quality balance. SynLLM
establishes that, when guided by well-designed prompts and evaluated with
robust, multi-metric criteria, LLMs can generate synthetic medical data that is
both clinically plausible and privacy-aware, paving the way for safer and more
effective data sharing in healthcare research.

Motivation: 现有社交代理多为场景定制，缺乏通用框架，限制了其跨场景泛化能力和行为一致性。

Conclusion: 理论驱动的框架显著提升了社交代理的行为真实性和适应性，为通用社交代理设计提供了系统方法。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models have demonstrated strong reasoning
and role-playing capabilities, opening new opportunities for agent-based social
simulations. However, most existing agents' implementations are
scenario-tailored, without a unified framework to guide the design. This lack
of a general social agent limits their ability to generalize across different
social contexts and to produce consistent, realistic behaviors. To address this
challenge, we propose a theory-informed framework that provides a systematic
design process for LLM-based social agents. Our framework is grounded in
principles from Social Cognition Theory and introduces three key modules:
motivation, action planning, and learning. These modules jointly enable agents
to reason about their goals, plan coherent actions, and adapt their behavior
over time, leading to more flexible and contextually appropriate responses.
Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our theory-driven agents reproduce
realistic human behavior patterns under complex conditions, achieving up to 75%
lower deviation from real-world behavioral data across multiple fidelity
metrics compared to classical generative baselines. Ablation studies further
show that removing motivation, planning, or learning modules increases errors
by 1.5 to 3.2 times, confirming their distinct and essential contributions to
generating realistic and coherent social behaviors.

Conclusion: AgriGPT提供了一个模块化、可扩展的农业LLM框架，支持开放研究和农业社区赋能。

Abstract: Despite the rapid progress of Large Language Models (LLMs), their application
in agriculture remains limited due to the lack of domain-specific models,
curated datasets, and robust evaluation frameworks. To address these
challenges, we propose AgriGPT, a domain-specialized LLM ecosystem for
agricultural usage. At its core, we design a multi-agent scalable data engine
that systematically compiles credible data sources into Agri-342K, a
high-quality, standardized question-answer (QA) dataset. Trained on this
dataset, AgriGPT supports a broad range of agricultural stakeholders, from
practitioners to policy-makers. To enhance factual grounding, we employ
Tri-RAG, a three-channel Retrieval-Augmented Generation framework combining
dense retrieval, sparse retrieval, and multi-hop knowledge graph reasoning,
thereby improving the LLM's reasoning reliability. For comprehensive
evaluation, we introduce AgriBench-13K, a benchmark suite comprising 13 tasks
with varying types and complexities. Experiments demonstrate that AgriGPT
significantly outperforms general-purpose LLMs on both domain adaptation and
reasoning. Beyond the model itself, AgriGPT represents a modular and extensible
LLM ecosystem for agriculture, comprising structured data construction,
retrieval-enhanced generation, and domain-specific evaluation. This work
provides a generalizable framework for developing scientific and
industry-specialized LLMs. All models, datasets, and code will be released to
empower agricultural communities, especially in underserved regions, and to
promote open, impactful research.

Result: MLLMs在个体水平上优于人类，但人类集体智慧和人类-AI协作表现更佳。

Conclusion: 人类集体智慧和人类-AI协作是发展情感智能AI系统的关键。

Abstract: The ability to discern subtle emotional cues is fundamental to human social
intelligence. As artificial intelligence (AI) becomes increasingly common, AI's
ability to recognize and respond to human emotions is crucial for effective
human-AI interactions. In particular, whether such systems can match or surpass
human experts remains to be seen. However, the emotional intelligence of AI,
particularly multimodal large language models (MLLMs), remains largely
unexplored. This study evaluates the emotion recognition abilities of MLLMs
using the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test (RMET) and its multiracial
counterpart (MRMET), and compares their performance against human participants.
Results show that, on average, MLLMs outperform humans in accurately
identifying emotions across both tests. This trend persists even when comparing
performance across low, medium, and expert-level performing groups. Yet when we
aggregate independent human decisions to simulate collective intelligence,
human groups significantly surpass the performance of aggregated MLLM
predictions, highlighting the wisdom of the crowd. Moreover, a collaborative
approach (augmented intelligence) that combines human and MLLM predictions
achieves greater accuracy than either humans or MLLMs alone. These results
suggest that while MLLMs exhibit strong emotion recognition at the individual
level, the collective intelligence of humans and the synergistic potential of
human-AI collaboration offer the most promising path toward effective emotional
AI. We discuss the implications of these findings for the development of
emotionally intelligent AI systems and future research directions.

Motivation: ASP常因基础程序规模过大而受阻，现有方法多依赖临时启发式策略，缺乏通用性。

Method: 引入diminution概念，定义其形式化性质，并通过特定编码利用现有ASP求解器评估候选子集。

Result: 实验表明，该方法平均减少70%的基础时间，基础文件大小减少85%。

Conclusion: diminution是一种通用且有效的方法，可缓解ASP中的基础瓶颈。

Abstract: Answer Set Programming (ASP) is often hindered by the grounding bottleneck:
large Herbrand universes generate ground programs so large that solving becomes
difficult. Many methods employ ad-hoc heuristics to improve grounding
performance, motivating the need for a more formal and generalizable strategy.
We introduce the notion of diminution, defined as a selected subset of the
Herbrand universe used to generate a reduced ground program before solving. We
give a formal definition of diminution, analyze its key properties, and study
the complexity of identifying it. We use a specific encoding that enables
off-the-shelf ASP solver to evaluate candidate subsets. Our approach integrates
seamlessly with existing grounders via domain predicates. In extensive
experiments on five benchmarks, applying diminutions selected by our strategy
yields significant performance improvements, reducing grounding time by up to
70% on average and decreasing the size of grounding files by up to 85%. These
results demonstrate that leveraging diminutions constitutes a robust and
general-purpose approach for alleviating the grounding bottleneck in ASP.

Result: 该框架在多样化医疗场景中表现出稳健且可扩展的性能，支持医生在预算内逐步获取最有信息量的特征。

Conclusion: 该方法为EHR数据提供了一种有效的特征选择解决方案，有助于优化临床决策和资源利用。

Abstract: Electronic Health Records (EHR) have revolutionized healthcare by digitizing
patient data, improving accessibility, and streamlining clinical workflows.
However, extracting meaningful insights from these complex and multimodal
datasets remains a significant challenge for researchers. Traditional feature
selection methods often struggle with the inherent sparsity and heterogeneity
of EHR data, especially when accounting for patient-specific variations and
feature costs in clinical applications. To address these challenges, we propose
a novel personalized, online and cost-aware feature selection framework
tailored specifically for EHR datasets. The features are aquired in an online
fashion for individual patients, incorporating budgetary constraints and
feature variability costs. The framework is designed to effectively manage
sparse and multimodal data, ensuring robust and scalable performance in diverse
healthcare contexts. A primary application of our proposed method is to support
physicians' decision making in patient screening scenarios. By guiding
physicians toward incremental acquisition of the most informative features
within budget constraints, our approach aims to increase diagnostic confidence
while optimizing resource utilization.

Abstract: Accurate evaluation of procedural communication compliance is essential in
simulation-based training, particularly in safety-critical domains where
adherence to compliance checklists reflects operational competence. This paper
explores a lightweight, deployable approach using prompt-based inference with
open-source large language models (LLMs) that can run efficiently on
consumer-grade GPUs. We present Prompt-and-Check, a method that uses
context-rich prompts to evaluate whether each checklist item in a protocol has
been fulfilled, solely based on transcribed verbal exchanges. We perform a case
study in the maritime domain with participants performing an identical
simulation task, and experiment with models such as LLama 2 7B, LLaMA 3 8B and
Mistral 7B, running locally on an RTX 4070 GPU. For each checklist item, a
prompt incorporating relevant transcript excerpts is fed into the model, which
outputs a compliance judgment. We assess model outputs against expert-annotated
ground truth using classification accuracy and agreement scores. Our findings
demonstrate that prompting enables effective context-aware reasoning without
task-specific training. This study highlights the practical utility of LLMs in
augmenting debriefing, performance feedback, and automated assessment in
training environments.

Abstract: In this research, we propose an iterative learning hybrid optimization solver
developed to strengthen the performance of metaheuristic algorithms in solving

integrates the proposed Node-Destroyer Model, a machine learning hybrid model
that utilized Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) such identifies and selects customer
nodes to guide the Large Neighborhood Search (LNS) operator within the
metaheuristic optimization frameworks. This model leverages the structural
properties of the problem and solution that can be represented as a graph, to
guide strategic selections concerning node removal. The proposed approach
reduces operational complexity and scales down the search space involved in the
optimization process. The hybrid approach is applied specifically to the CVRP
and does not require retraining across problem instances of different sizes.
The proposed hybrid mechanism is able to improve the performance of baseline
metaheuristic algorithms. Our approach not only enhances the solution quality
for standard CVRP benchmarks but also proves scalability on very large-scale
instances with up to 30,000 customer nodes. Experimental evaluations on
benchmark datasets show that the proposed hybrid mechanism is capable of
improving different baseline algorithms, achieving better quality of solutions
under similar settings.

Method: 结合开源模型，通过监督微调（SFT）和强化学习（RLVR）优化，采用新颖的探索策略如自适应组调整和温度缩放。

Result: 在JEE Main 2025和MATH、GSM8K等基准测试中，Aryabhata在准确性和效率上优于现有模型。

Conclusion: Aryabhata作为开源小语言模型，为考试教育提供了实用工具，未来将持续优化以提升学习效果。

Abstract: We present Aryabhata 1.0, a compact 7B parameter math reasoning model
optimized for the Indian academic exam, the Joint Entrance Examination (JEE).
Despite rapid progress in large language models (LLMs), current models often
remain unsuitable for educational use. Aryabhata 1.0 is built by merging strong
open-weight reasoning models, followed by supervised fine-tuning (SFT) with
curriculum learning on verified chain-of-thought (CoT) traces curated through
best-of-$n$ rejection sampling. To further boost performance, we apply
reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) using A2C objective with
group-relative advantage estimation along with novel exploration strategies
such as Adaptive Group Resizing and Temperature Scaling. Evaluated on both
in-distribution (JEE Main 2025) and out-of-distribution (MATH, GSM8K)
benchmarks, Aryabhata outperforms existing models in accuracy and efficiency,
while offering pedagogically useful step-by-step reasoning. We release
Aryabhata as a foundation model to advance exam-centric, open-source small
language models. This marks our first open release for community feedback
(https://huggingface.co/PhysicsWallahAI/Aryabhata-1.0); PW is actively training
future models to further improve learning outcomes for students.

TL;DR: STELAR-Vision是一种训练框架，通过TopoAug数据增强和Frugal Learning方法，提升视觉语言模型在复杂多模态任务中的准确性和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型依赖链式推理（CoT），无法充分利用其他拓扑结构（如树或图）的优势，导致复杂任务表现不佳且输出冗长。

Method: 提出STELAR-Vision框架，包括TopoAug数据增强和Frugal Learning方法，通过监督微调和强化学习优化模型。

Result: 在MATH-V和VLM-S2H上，STELAR-Vision比基础模型准确率提升9.7%，并在多个OOD基准测试中表现优异。

Conclusion: STELAR-Vision通过拓扑感知推理显著提升模型性能，具有强泛化能力。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have made significant strides in reasoning, yet
they often struggle with complex multimodal tasks and tend to generate overly
verbose outputs. A key limitation is their reliance on chain-of-thought (CoT)
reasoning, despite many tasks benefiting from alternative topologies like trees
or graphs. To address this, we introduce STELAR-Vision, a training framework
for topology-aware reasoning. At its core is TopoAug, a synthetic data pipeline
that enriches training with diverse topological structures. Using supervised
fine-tuning and reinforcement learning, we post-train Qwen2VL models with both
accuracy and efficiency in mind. Additionally, we propose Frugal Learning,
which reduces output length with minimal accuracy loss. On MATH-V and VLM-S2H,
STELAR-Vision improves accuracy by 9.7% over its base model and surpasses the
larger Qwen2VL-72B-Instruct by 7.3%. On five out-of-distribution benchmarks, it
outperforms Phi-4-Multimodal-Instruct by up to 28.4% and
LLaMA-3.2-11B-Vision-Instruct by up to 13.2%, demonstrating strong
generalization. Compared to Chain-Only training, our approach achieves 4.3%
higher overall accuracy on in-distribution datasets and consistently
outperforms across all OOD benchmarks. We have released datasets, and code will
be available.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种记忆增强的AR代理框架，旨在通过学习和适应用户长期经验，解决现有AR代理在复杂多步骤场景中的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AR代理在复杂多步骤场景中表现不佳，无法利用用户长期经验和偏好，因此需要一种能够存储和推理历史交互的解决方案。

Method: 提出了一个包含感知、记忆、时空推理和执行四个模块的框架，并提供了实现路线图和评估策略。

Result: 该框架能够通过学习和适应用户特定经验，提供个性化的任务辅助。

Conclusion: 该工作为未来开发更智能的AR系统提供了方向，旨在将用户交互历史与自适应任务辅助有效结合。

Abstract: Augmented Reality (AR) systems are increasingly integrating foundation
models, such as Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), to provide more
context-aware and adaptive user experiences. This integration has led to the
development of AR agents to support intelligent, goal-directed interactions in
real-world environments. While current AR agents effectively support immediate
tasks, they struggle with complex multi-step scenarios that require
understanding and leveraging user's long-term experiences and preferences. This
limitation stems from their inability to capture, retain, and reason over
historical user interactions in spatiotemporal contexts. To address these
challenges, we propose a conceptual framework for memory-augmented AR agents
that can provide personalized task assistance by learning from and adapting to
user-specific experiences over time. Our framework consists of four
interconnected modules: (1) Perception Module for multimodal sensor processing,
(2) Memory Module for persistent spatiotemporal experience storage, (3)
Spatiotemporal Reasoning Module for synthesizing past and present contexts, and
(4) Actuator Module for effective AR communication. We further present an
implementation roadmap, a future evaluation strategy, a potential target
application and use cases to demonstrate the practical applicability of our
framework across diverse domains. We aim for this work to motivate future
research toward developing more intelligent AR systems that can effectively
bridge user's interaction history with adaptive, context-aware task assistance.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于功能的新型分类法，用于全面评估大型语言模型（LLM）的知识编辑方法，重点关注不同知识类型的编辑效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于大型语言模型的知识可能过时或不准确，而重新训练成本高昂，知识编辑成为一种高效替代方案。现有研究多关注编辑机制，而忽略了知识的功能类型。

Method: 引入功能分类法，结合知识类型（如事实、时间、概念、常识、社会）和编辑机制，系统评估现有方法。

Result: 通过功能分类法，揭示了编辑效果与目标知识类型的相关性，总结了现有方法的优缺点。

Conclusion: 论文为知识编辑领域提供了更全面的视角，并提出了未来研究的开放挑战和方向。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) acquire vast knowledge from large text corpora,
but this information can become outdated or inaccurate. Since retraining is
computationally expensive, knowledge editing offers an efficient alternative --
modifying internal knowledge without full retraining. These methods aim to
update facts precisely while preserving the model's overall capabilities. While
existing surveys focus on the mechanism of editing (e.g., parameter changes vs.
external memory), they often overlook the function of the knowledge being
edited. This survey introduces a novel, complementary function-based taxonomy
to provide a more holistic view. We examine how different mechanisms apply to
various knowledge types -- factual, temporal, conceptual, commonsense, and
social -- highlighting how editing effectiveness depends on the nature of the
target knowledge. By organizing our review along these two axes, we map the
current landscape, outline the strengths and limitations of existing methods,
define the problem formally, survey evaluation tasks and datasets, and conclude
with open challenges and future directions.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 知识图谱通常不完整，而现有的链接预测方法缺乏可解释性，且缺乏统一的评估标准和资源。

Method: 提出GRainsaCK，通过模块化设计实现从模型训练到解释评估的全流程标准化。

Result: GRainsaCK提供了可扩展的模块化功能和详细文档，支持解释方法的评估和比较。

Conclusion: GRainsaCK填补了知识图谱解释方法评估的空白，并促进了其复用和扩展。

Abstract: Since Knowledge Graphs are often incomplete, link prediction methods are
adopted for predicting missing facts. Scalable embedding based solutions are
mostly adopted for this purpose, however, they lack comprehensibility, which
may be crucial in several domains. Explanation methods tackle this issue by
identifying supporting knowledge explaining the predicted facts. Regretfully,
evaluating/comparing quantitatively the resulting explanations is challenging
as there is no standard evaluation protocol and overall benchmarking resource.
We fill this important gap by proposing GRainsaCK, a reusable software resource
that fully streamlines all the tasks involved in benchmarking explanations,
i.e., from model training to evaluation of explanations along the same
evaluation protocol. Moreover, GRainsaCK furthers modularity/extensibility by
implementing the main components as functions that can be easily replaced.
Finally, fostering its reuse, we provide extensive documentation including a
tutorial.

TL;DR: E-Agent框架通过动态规划多模态工具和优化执行流程，显著提升了多模态检索增强生成（mRAG）的性能，减少了冗余搜索。

Motivation: 解决现有mRAG方法在动态规划和视觉信息利用上的不足，提升实时场景下的表现。

Method: 提出E-Agent框架，包含动态规划的多模态工具协调器和任务执行器，采用一次性规划策略。

Result: 在RemPlan基准测试中，E-Agent比现有方法准确率提升13%，冗余搜索减少37%。

Conclusion: E-Agent通过动态规划和优化执行流程，显著提升了mRAG的效率和准确性。

Abstract: Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (mRAG) has emerged as a promising
solution to address the temporal limitations of Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs) in real-world scenarios like news analysis and trending topics.
However, existing approaches often suffer from rigid retrieval strategies and
under-utilization of visual information. To bridge this gap, we propose
E-Agent, an agent framework featuring two key innovations: a mRAG planner
trained to dynamically orchestrate multimodal tools based on contextual
reasoning, and a task executor employing tool-aware execution sequencing to
implement optimized mRAG workflows. E-Agent adopts a one-time mRAG planning
strategy that enables efficient information retrieval while minimizing
redundant tool invocations. To rigorously assess the planning capabilities of
mRAG systems, we introduce the Real-World mRAG Planning (RemPlan) benchmark.
This novel benchmark contains both retrieval-dependent and
retrieval-independent question types, systematically annotated with essential
retrieval tools required for each instance. The benchmark's explicit mRAG
planning annotations and diverse question design enhance its practical
relevance by simulating real-world scenarios requiring dynamic mRAG decisions.
Experiments across RemPlan and three established benchmarks demonstrate
E-Agent's superiority: 13% accuracy gain over state-of-the-art mRAG methods
while reducing redundant searches by 37%.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种双代理混合框架，以减少单代理数学推理系统中的认知负载干扰，并通过实验验证其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前工具集成的数学推理系统通常采用单代理范式，导致认知负载干扰，影响推理和代码生成的协调。

Method: 提出双代理框架：推理代理负责问题分解，代码代理处理代码生成与执行。训练结合模仿学习和强化学习。

Result: 实验表明，双代理框架显著提高了正确推理路径的数量，减少了认知干扰。

Conclusion: 双代理设计能有效协调推理与代码生成，提升系统性能。

Abstract: Current tool-integrated mathematical reasoning systems often adopt a
single-agent paradigm, where one large language model handles problem
reasoning, code generation, and code execution in an integrated workflow. While
this design eases coordination, we hypothesize that it imposes cognitive load
interference, as the agent must interleave long-horizon reasoning with precise
program synthesis. We validate this hypothesis through a controlled comparison
between a reasoning-only agent and a reasoning-plus-code agent, finding that
the latter produces significantly fewer correct reasoning paths despite having
tool-calling capabilities. To address this, we propose a dual-agent hybrid
framework: a Reasoning Agent performs stepwise problem decomposition, and a
Code Agent handles code generation and execution. Training combines imitation
learning and reinforcement learning: the Code Agent receives strong rewards for
matching intermediate ground-truth programs and weaker rewards for valid
execution, while the Reasoning Agent is optimized chiefly via final-answer
accuracy using advantage estimation to credit intermediate steps. This
decoupled role design reduces cognitive interference and promotes stable
reasoning-coding coordination.

Conclusion: 该模型为大规模模型的强化学习提供了低成本高效训练方案，具有进一步研究潜力。

Abstract: Recent R1-Zero-like research further demonstrates that reasoning extension
has given large language models (LLMs) unprecedented reasoning capabilities,
and Reinforcement Learning is the core technology to elicit its complex
reasoning. However, conducting RL experiments directly on hyperscale models
involves high computational costs and resource demands, posing significant
risks. We propose the Compass-Thinker-7B model, which aims to explore the
potential of Reinforcement Learning with less computational resources and
costs, and provides insights for further research into RL recipes for larger
models. Compass-Thinker-7B is trained from an open source model through a
specially designed Reinforcement Learning Pipeline. we curate a dataset of 30k
verifiable mathematics problems for the Reinforcement Learning Pipeline. By
configuring data and training settings with different difficulty distributions
for different stages, the potential of the model is gradually released and the
training efficiency is improved. Extensive evaluations show that
Compass-Thinker-7B possesses exceptional reasoning potential, and achieves
superior performance on mathematics compared to the same-sized RL
model.Especially in the challenging AIME2024 evaluation, Compass-Thinker-7B
achieves 40% accuracy.

Method: 提出隐式推理安全概念，构建数据集SSUI，并通过上下文学习验证缓解方法。

Result: SSUI数据集成功展示隐式推理威胁，上下文学习显著缓解问题。

Conclusion: 需改进跨模态隐式推理能力以应对安全隐患。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models face growing safety challenges with multimodal
inputs. This paper introduces the concept of Implicit Reasoning Safety, a
vulnerability in LVLMs. Benign combined inputs trigger unsafe LVLM outputs due
to flawed or hidden reasoning. To showcase this, we developed Safe Semantics,
Unsafe Interpretations, the first dataset for this critical issue. Our
demonstrations show that even simple In-Context Learning with SSUI
significantly mitigates these implicit multimodal threats, underscoring the
urgent need to improve cross-modal implicit reasoning.

TL;DR: 研究探讨了前景理论是否适用于大型语言模型（LLM），以及不确定性语言标记（如“可能”）是否影响其决策行为。通过三阶段实验，发现前景理论在LLM中的适用性不一致，尤其是当不确定性以多样语言形式表达时。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 前景理论（PT）用于人类不确定性决策，但尚未明确是否适用于LLM，且不确定性语言标记对其决策的影响未被充分研究。

Method: 设计基于经济问卷的三阶段实验，提出通用评估框架，结合不确定性语言标记的概率值，分析其对LLM决策的影响。

Result: 前景理论在LLM中的建模效果不稳定，尤其是面对多样化语言表达的不确定性时。

Conclusion: 前景理论在LLM中的适用性有限，语言形式的不确定性表达显著影响其决策行为。

Abstract: Prospect Theory (PT) models human decision-making under uncertainty, while
epistemic markers (e.g., maybe) serve to express uncertainty in language.
However, it remains largely unexplored whether Prospect Theory applies to
contemporary Large Language Models and whether epistemic markers, which express
human uncertainty, affect their decision-making behaviour. To address these
research gaps, we design a three-stage experiment based on economic
questionnaires. We propose a more general and precise evaluation framework to
model LLMs' decision-making behaviour under PT, introducing uncertainty through
the empirical probability values associated with commonly used epistemic
markers in comparable contexts. We then incorporate epistemic markers into the
evaluation framework based on their corresponding probability values to examine
their influence on LLM decision-making behaviours. Our findings suggest that
modelling LLMs' decision-making with PT is not consistently reliable,
particularly when uncertainty is expressed in diverse linguistic forms. Our
code is released in https://github.com/HKUST-KnowComp/MarPT.

Abstract: Multi-agent systems built on Large Language Models (LLMs) show exceptional
promise for complex collaborative problem-solving, yet they face fundamental
challenges stemming from context window limitations that impair memory
consistency, role adherence, and procedural integrity. This paper introduces
Intrinsic Memory Agents, a novel framework that addresses these limitations
through structured agent-specific memories that evolve intrinsically with agent
outputs. Specifically, our method maintains role-aligned memory templates that
preserve specialized perspectives while focusing on task-relevant information.
We benchmark our approach on the PDDL dataset, comparing its performance to
existing state-of-the-art multi-agentic memory approaches and showing an
improvement of 38.6\% with the highest token efficiency. An additional
evaluation is performed on a complex data pipeline design task, we demonstrate
that our approach produces higher quality designs when comparing 5 metrics:
scalability, reliability, usability, cost-effectiveness and documentation with
additional qualitative evidence of the improvements. Our findings suggest that
addressing memory limitations through structured, intrinsic approaches can
improve the capabilities of multi-agent LLM systems on structured planning
tasks.

Motivation: 大型语言模型（LLMs）可能放大有害偏见，传统方法（如数据过滤或后处理）将模型视为黑箱，缺乏直接干预能力。

Method: 1. 训练线性探针检测模型内部激活中的偏见表示；2. 计算转向向量对比偏见与中性语句的激活模式，实时调整生成内容。

Result: 在GPT2-large上实验表明，探针能近乎完美识别偏见，转向向量成功将偏见生成内容导向中性替代。

Conclusion: 该系统为构建更安全、可解释的LLMs提供了直接且可复现的方法。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) become more integrated into societal systems,
the risk of them perpetuating and amplifying harmful biases becomes a critical
safety concern. Traditional methods for mitigating bias often rely on data
filtering or post-hoc output moderation, which treat the model as an opaque
black box. In this work, we introduce a complete, end-to-end system that uses
techniques from mechanistic interpretability to both identify and actively
mitigate bias directly within a model's internal workings. Our method involves
two primary stages. First, we train linear "probes" on the internal activations
of a model to detect the latent representations of various biases (e.g.,
gender, race, age). Our experiments on \texttt{gpt2-large} demonstrate that
these probes can identify biased content with near-perfect accuracy, revealing
that bias representations become most salient in the model's later layers.
Second, we leverage these findings to compute "steering vectors" by contrasting
the model's activation patterns for biased and neutral statements. By adding
these vectors during inference, we can actively steer the model's generative
process away from producing harmful, stereotypical, or biased content in
real-time. We demonstrate the efficacy of this activation steering technique,
showing that it successfully alters biased completions toward more neutral
alternatives. We present our work as a robust and reproducible system that
offers a more direct and interpretable approach to building safer and more
accountable LLMs.

Motivation: 现有研究主要关注已知匹配司机信息后的等待时间预测，而乘客在提交请求前的等待时间预测同样重要，但尚未充分研究。

Method: 通过数据驱动的方法分析供需动态对等待时间的影响，并基于特征工程提出FiXGBoost模型。

Result: 在大规模真实数据集（超过3000万条记录）上，FiXGBoost表现出色，且具有高解释性。

Conclusion: FiXGBoost为预请求等待时间预测提供了有效且可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: Passenger waiting time prediction plays a critical role in enhancing both
ridesharing user experience and platform efficiency. While most existing
research focuses on post-request waiting time prediction with knowing the
matched driver information, pre-request waiting time prediction (i.e., before
submitting a ride request and without matching a driver) is also important, as
it enables passengers to plan their trips more effectively and enhance the
experience of both passengers and drivers. However, it has not been fully
studied by existing works. In this paper, we take the first step toward
understanding the predictability and explainability of pre-request passenger
waiting time in ridesharing systems. Particularly, we conduct an in-depth
data-driven study to investigate the impact of demand&supply dynamics on
passenger waiting time. Based on this analysis and feature engineering, we
propose FiXGBoost, a novel feature interaction-based XGBoost model designed to
predict waiting time without knowing the assigned driver information. We
further perform an importance analysis to quantify the contribution of each
factor. Experiments on a large-scale real-world ridesharing dataset including
over 30 million trip records show that our FiXGBoost can achieve a good
performance for pre-request passenger waiting time prediction with high
explainability.

Motivation: 轨道电路是铁路运营的关键，其故障可能导致连锁中断。传统方法难以检测早期细微异常，需改进维护计划以减少停机时间和收入损失。

Method: 利用深度神经网络构建预测性维护框架，结合ISO-17359标准，并通过符合性预测提供不确定性估计。

Conclusion: 该方法可扩展至全球部署的CVCM及其他轨道电路系统，提升运营可靠性。

Abstract: Track circuits are critical for railway operations, acting as the main
signalling sub-system to locate trains. Continuous Variable Current Modulation
(CVCM) is one such technology. Like any field-deployed, safety-critical asset,
it can fail, triggering cascading disruptions. Many failures originate as
subtle anomalies that evolve over time, often not visually apparent in
monitored signals. Conventional approaches, which rely on clear signal changes,
struggle to detect them early. Early identification of failure types is
essential to improve maintenance planning, minimising downtime and revenue
loss. Leveraging deep neural networks, we propose a predictive maintenance
framework that classifies anomalies well before they escalate into failures.
Validated on 10 CVCM failure cases across different installations, the method
is ISO-17359 compliant and outperforms conventional techniques, achieving
99.31% overall accuracy with detection within 1% of anomaly onset. Through
conformal prediction, we provide uncertainty estimates, reaching 99% confidence
with consistent coverage across classes. Given CVCMs global deployment, the
approach is scalable and adaptable to other track circuits and railway systems,
enhancing operational reliability.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的检索增强生成（RAG）和多模态检索增强生成（MRAG）系统在引入外部知识时，无法明确追踪生成内容的来源，导致隐私泄露责任难以界定。

Method: 提出SMA方法，通过半黑盒审计和零阶优化机制，实现细粒度的来源追踪；并设计跨模态归因技术，将图像输入转化为文本描述，实现文本模态的标记级归因。

Result: SMA能够可靠地区分生成内容的来源（预训练数据、外部检索或用户输入），并首次实现了对MRAG系统中图像检索痕迹的成员推断。

Conclusion: SMA将成员推断的关注点从‘数据是否被记忆’转向‘内容来源何处’，为复杂生成系统中的数据溯源审计提供了新视角。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and its Multimodal Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (MRAG) significantly improve the knowledge coverage and contextual
understanding of Large Language Models (LLMs) by introducing external knowledge
sources. However, retrieval and multimodal fusion obscure content provenance,
rendering existing membership inference methods unable to reliably attribute
generated outputs to pre-training, external retrieval, or user input, thus
undermining privacy leakage accountability
  To address these challenges, we propose the first Source-aware Membership
Audit (SMA) that enables fine-grained source attribution of generated content
in a semi-black-box setting with retrieval control capabilities.To address the
environmental constraints of semi-black-box auditing, we further design an
attribution estimation mechanism based on zero-order optimization, which
robustly approximates the true influence of input tokens on the output through
large-scale perturbation sampling and ridge regression modeling. In addition,
SMA introduces a cross-modal attribution technique that projects image inputs
into textual descriptions via MLLMs, enabling token-level attribution in the
text modality, which for the first time facilitates membership inference on
image retrieval traces in MRAG systems. This work shifts the focus of
membership inference from 'whether the data has been memorized' to 'where the
content is sourced from', offering a novel perspective for auditing data
provenance in complex generative systems.

Motivation: 随着CUA的商业潜力增长，其关键细节仍封闭，研究社区需要开放框架以研究其能力、局限和风险。

Method: OpenCUA包括注释基础设施、大规模数据集AgentNet、可扩展的演示转换管道，并采用长链思维推理。

Result: OpenCUA-32B在OSWorld-Verified上达到34.8%的平均成功率，超越GPT-4o，成为开源模型的新SOTA。

Conclusion: OpenCUA为CUA研究提供了开放基础，其方法跨领域泛化能力强，且受益于测试时计算增加。

Abstract: Vision-language models have demonstrated impressive capabilities as
computer-use agents (CUAs) capable of automating diverse computer tasks. As
their commercial potential grows, critical details of the most capable CUA
systems remain closed. As these agents will increasingly mediate digital
interactions and execute consequential decisions on our behalf, the research
community needs access to open CUA frameworks to study their capabilities,
limitations, and risks. To bridge this gap, we propose OpenCUA, a comprehensive
open-source framework for scaling CUA data and foundation models. Our framework
consists of: (1) an annotation infrastructure that seamlessly captures human
computer-use demonstrations; (2) AgentNet, the first large-scale computer-use
task dataset spanning 3 operating systems and 200+ applications and websites;
(3) a scalable pipeline that transforms demonstrations into state-action pairs
with reflective long Chain-of-Thought reasoning that sustain robust performance
gains as data scales. Our end-to-end agent models demonstrate strong
performance across CUA benchmarks. In particular, OpenCUA-32B achieves an
average success rate of 34.8% on OSWorld-Verified, establishing a new
state-of-the-art (SOTA) among open-source models and surpassing OpenAI CUA
(GPT-4o). Further analysis confirms that our approach generalizes well across
domains and benefits significantly from increased test-time computation. We
release our annotation tool, datasets, code, and models to build open
foundations for further CUA research.

TL;DR: BrowseMaster是一个可扩展的框架，通过规划-执行代理对解决LLM代理在信息搜索中的局限性，实现广泛搜索与深度推理的平衡。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于LLM的代理在搜索广度和推理深度上存在不足，限制了信息搜索的效果。

Method: 采用规划-执行代理对，规划器根据任务约束制定搜索策略，执行器进行高效检索并提供相关证据。

Result: 在英语和中文基准测试中表现优异，BrowseComp-en得分30.0，BrowseComp-zh得分46.5。

Conclusion: BrowseMaster在复杂、推理密集型信息搜索任务中表现出色，优于现有基线。

Abstract: Effective information seeking in the vast and ever-growing digital landscape
requires balancing expansive search with strategic reasoning. Current large
language model (LLM)-based agents struggle to achieve this balance due to
limitations in search breadth and reasoning depth, where slow, serial querying
restricts coverage of relevant sources and noisy raw inputs disrupt the
continuity of multi-step reasoning. To address these challenges, we propose
BrowseMaster, a scalable framework built around a programmatically augmented
planner-executor agent pair. The planner formulates and adapts search
strategies based on task constraints, while the executor conducts efficient,
targeted retrieval to supply the planner with concise, relevant evidence. This
division of labor preserves coherent, long-horizon reasoning while sustaining
broad and systematic exploration, overcoming the trade-off that limits existing
agents. Extensive experiments on challenging English and Chinese benchmarks
show that BrowseMaster consistently outperforms open-source and proprietary
baselines, achieving scores of 30.0 on BrowseComp-en and 46.5 on BrowseComp-zh,
which demonstrates its strong capability in complex, reasoning-heavy
information-seeking tasks at scale.

*Nitin Yadav,Changsung Kang,Hongwei Shang,Ming Sun*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: ReLSum是一个基于强化学习的框架，用于生成简洁且与查询相关的产品描述摘要，以优化电商搜索的相关性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 产品标题缺乏细节，无法充分捕捉查询意图，而完整描述又因冗长不适合实时排名。

Method: 利用强化学习框架，以相关性分数为奖励，训练大型语言模型生成摘要，用于交叉编码器排名模型。

Result: 离线指标（如召回率和NDCG）和在线用户参与度指标均有显著提升。

Conclusion: ReLSum为大规模电商系统提供了一种可扩展且高效的搜索相关性增强方案。

Abstract: E-commerce search engines often rely solely on product titles as input for
ranking models with latency constraints. However, this approach can result in
suboptimal relevance predictions, as product titles often lack sufficient
detail to capture query intent. While product descriptions provide richer
information, their verbosity and length make them unsuitable for real-time
ranking, particularly for computationally expensive architectures like
cross-encoder ranking models. To address this challenge, we propose ReLSum, a
novel reinforcement learning framework designed to generate concise,
query-relevant summaries of product descriptions optimized for search
relevance. ReLSum leverages relevance scores as rewards to align the objectives
of summarization and ranking, effectively overcoming limitations of prior
methods, such as misaligned learning targets. The framework employs a trainable
large language model (LLM) to produce summaries, which are then used as input
for a cross-encoder ranking model. Experimental results demonstrate significant
improvements in offline metrics, including recall and NDCG, as well as online
user engagement metrics. ReLSum provides a scalable and efficient solution for
enhancing search relevance in large-scale e-commerce systems.

TL;DR: LLM-TUP是一种基于大语言模型的用户画像方法，通过时间戳和自然语言表示建模长短期偏好，显著提升推荐系统性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有用户画像方法过于简单，无法捕捉用户偏好的动态性和长短期交互，需要更精细的建模方法。

Method: 利用LLM生成用户历史的自然语言表示，结合BERT编码和时间注意力机制动态融合长短期偏好。

Result: 在真实数据集上，LLM-TUP显著优于基线方法，验证了时间感知和语义丰富用户画像的有效性。

Conclusion: LLM-TUP通过时间感知和语义丰富的用户画像，为基于内容的推荐系统提供了更优的解决方案。

Abstract: Accurately modeling user preferences is crucial for improving the performance
of content-based recommender systems. Existing approaches often rely on
simplistic user profiling methods, such as averaging or concatenating item
embeddings, which fail to capture the nuanced nature of user preference
dynamics, particularly the interactions between long-term and short-term
preferences. In this work, we propose LLM-driven Temporal User Profiling
(LLM-TUP), a novel method for user profiling that explicitly models short-term
and long-term preferences by leveraging interaction timestamps and generating
natural language representations of user histories using a large language model
(LLM). These representations are encoded into high-dimensional embeddings using
a pre-trained BERT model, and an attention mechanism is applied to dynamically
fuse the short-term and long-term embeddings into a comprehensive user profile.
Experimental results on real-world datasets demonstrate that LLM-TUP achieves
substantial improvements over several baselines, underscoring the effectiveness
of our temporally aware user-profiling approach and the use of semantically
rich user profiles, generated by LLMs, for personalized content-based
recommendation.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了大型语言模型（LLMs）在生成时间感知用户画像中的有效性，重点分析了其对短期和长期用户偏好的动态捕捉能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统用户画像方法难以捕捉用户偏好的时间动态性，如短期兴趣和长期品味的差异。

Method: 通过将时间偏好作为动态用户上下文，将短期和长期偏好分离并融合为综合用户嵌入。

Result: LLM生成的画像在语义深度和时间结构上表现良好，但在稀疏数据环境中效果有限。

Conclusion: LLMs在增强用户画像方面具有潜力，但实际效果依赖于数据集的特性和用户交互历史的丰富程度。

Abstract: Effective recommender systems demand dynamic user understanding, especially
in complex, evolving environments. Traditional user profiling often fails to
capture the nuanced, temporal contextual factors of user preferences, such as
transient short-term interests and enduring long-term tastes. This paper
presents an assessment of Large Language Models (LLMs) for generating
semantically rich, time-aware user profiles. We do not propose a novel
end-to-end recommendation architecture; instead, the core contribution is a
systematic investigation into the degree of LLM effectiveness in capturing the
dynamics of user context by disentangling short-term and long-term preferences.
This approach, framing temporal preferences as dynamic user contexts for
recommendations, adaptively fuses these distinct contextual components into
comprehensive user embeddings. The evaluation across Movies&TV and Video Games
domains suggests that while LLM-generated profiles offer semantic depth and
temporal structure, their effectiveness for context-aware recommendations is
notably contingent on the richness of user interaction histories. Significant
gains are observed in dense domains (e.g., Movies&TV), whereas improvements are
less pronounced in sparse environments (e.g., Video Games). This work
highlights LLMs' nuanced potential in enhancing user profiling for adaptive,
context-aware recommendations, emphasizing the critical role of dataset
characteristics for practical applicability.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种自适应个性化方法APCIR，通过动态识别查询所需的个性化级别并融合多种查询重构，优化了对话信息检索系统的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对话信息检索系统在个性化处理上采用‘一刀切’策略，可能导致效果不佳，因此需要一种更灵活的方法。

Method: APCIR首先识别查询所需的个性化级别，生成多种增强查询，并通过动态权重分配融合这些查询。

Result: 在TREC iKAT数据集上的实验表明，APCIR优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 自适应个性化策略能有效提升对话信息检索系统的性能。

Abstract: Personalized conversational information retrieval (CIR) systems aim to
satisfy users' complex information needs through multi-turn interactions by
considering user profiles. However, not all search queries require
personalization. The challenge lies in appropriately incorporating
personalization elements into search when needed. Most existing studies
implicitly incorporate users' personal information and conversational context
using large language models without distinguishing the specific requirements
for each query turn. Such a ``one-size-fits-all'' personalization strategy
might lead to sub-optimal results. In this paper, we propose an adaptive
personalization method, in which we first identify the required personalization
level for a query and integrate personalized queries with other query
reformulations to produce various enhanced queries. Then, we design a
personalization-aware ranking fusion approach to assign fusion weights
dynamically to different reformulated queries, depending on the required
personalization level. The proposed adaptive personalized conversational
information retrieval framework APCIR is evaluated on two TREC iKAT datasets.
The results confirm the effectiveness of adaptive personalization of APCIR by
outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 知识图谱在Web上的快速增长和多样化需要一种方法来索引和表征其内容，特别是知识表示（KR）方法和技术的使用情况。

Method: 扩展IndeGx框架，采用本体导向的建模和处理方法，结合SPARQL规则和OWL RL本体，构建知识图谱的索引。

Result: 成功应用于300多个公开知识图谱端点，提供了关于支持的标准语言、本体使用和质量评估的快照。

Conclusion: IndeGx为社区提供了一种灵活、可定制的方法来监控知识图谱内容和KR实践应用，推动了语义网的发展。

Abstract: Over the last decade, knowledge graphs have multiplied, grown, and evolved on
the World Wide Web, and the advent of new standards, vocabularies, and
application domains has accelerated this trend. IndeGx is a framework
leveraging an extensible base of rules to index the content of KGs and the
capacities of their SPARQL endpoints. In this article, we show how knowledge
representation (KR) and reasoning methods and techniques can be used in a
reflexive manner to index and characterize existing knowledge graphs (KG) with
respect to their usage of KR methods and techniques. We extended IndeGx with a
fully ontology-oriented modeling and processing approach to do so. Using SPARQL
rules and an OWL RL ontology of the indexing domain, IndeGx can now build and
reason over an index of the contents and characteristics of an open collection
of public knowledge graphs. Our extension of the framework relies on a
declarative representation of procedural knowledge and collaborative
environments (e.g., GitHub) to provide an agile, customizable, and expressive
KR approach for building and maintaining such an index of knowledge graphs in
the wild. In doing so, we help anyone answer the question of what knowledge is
out there in the world wild Semantic Web in general, and we also help our
community monitor which KR research results are used in practice. In
particular, this article provides a snapshot of the state of the Semantic Web
regarding supported standard languages, ontology usage, and diverse quality
evaluations by applying this method to a collection of over 300 open knowledge
graph endpoints.

Motivation: 传统路线推荐方法忽视了路线局部质量和候选路线间的比较，而这些对提升推荐性能至关重要。

Method: 提出CCN模型，结合查询级、项目级和比较级特征，通过CCB模块实现路线间的综合比较，并设计可解释性评分网络。

Result: 离线与在线实验均显示CCN显著提升推荐性能，并具备强可解释性。

Conclusion: CCN成功解决了路线推荐中的关键问题，已在Amap应用中稳定运行一年，效果显著。

Abstract: Route recommendation (RR) is a core task of route planning in the Amap app,
with the goal of recommending the optimal route among candidate routes to
users. Unlike traditional recommendation methods, insights into the local
quality of routes and comparisons between candidate routes are crucial for
enhancing recommendation performance but often overlooked in previous studies.
To achieve these, we propose a novel model called Comprehensive Comparison
Network (CCN). CCN not only uses query-level features (e.g. user features) and
item-level features (e.g. route features, item embedding) that are common in
traditional recommendations, but also introduces comparison-level features
which describe the non-overlapping segments between different routes to capture
the local quality of routes. The key component Comprehensive Comparison Block
(CCB) in CCN is designed to enable comparisons between routes. CCB includes a
Comprehensive Comparison Operator (CCO) and a multi-scenario MLP, which can
update the representations of candidate routes based on a comprehensive
comparison. By stacking multiple CCBs, CCN can determine the final scores of
candidate routes and recommend the optimal one to the user. Additionally, since
routes directly affect the costs and risks experienced by users, the RR model
must be interpretable for online deployment. Therefore, we designed an
interpretable pair scoring network to achieve interpretability. Both offline
and online experiments demonstrate that CCN significantly improves RR
performance and exhibits strong interpretability. CCN has been fully deployed
in the Amap app for over a year, providing stable and optimal benefits for
route recommendations.

Motivation: 传统播客推荐评估方法存在曝光偏差和高成本问题，需要一种可扩展且可解释的替代方案。

Method: 采用两阶段方法：首先从用户90天的收听历史中构建自然语言用户档案，然后利用LLM基于这些档案进行细粒度评估。

Result: 在47名参与者的对照研究中，该方法与人类评估高度一致，且优于或等同于使用原始收听历史的变体。

Conclusion: 该框架为推荐系统提供了一种高效、基于档案的评估方法，适用于迭代测试和模型选择。

Abstract: Evaluating personalized recommendations remains a central challenge,
especially in long-form audio domains like podcasts, where traditional offline
metrics suffer from exposure bias and online methods such as A/B testing are
costly and operationally constrained. In this paper, we propose a novel
framework that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) as offline judges to
assess the quality of podcast recommendations in a scalable and interpretable
manner. Our two-stage profile-aware approach first constructs natural-language
user profiles distilled from 90 days of listening history. These profiles
summarize both topical interests and behavioral patterns, serving as compact,
interpretable representations of user preferences. Rather than prompting the
LLM with raw data, we use these profiles to provide high-level, semantically
rich context-enabling the LLM to reason more effectively about alignment
between a user's interests and recommended episodes. This reduces input
complexity and improves interpretability. The LLM is then prompted to deliver
fine-grained pointwise and pairwise judgments based on the profile-episode
match. In a controlled study with 47 participants, our profile-aware judge
matched human judgments with high fidelity and outperformed or matched a
variant using raw listening histories. The framework enables efficient,
profile-aware evaluation for iterative testing and model selection in
recommender systems.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种利用大语言模型预过滤用户历史数据的方法，以减少反事实解释中的偏见，使其更符合用户偏好。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有反事实解释方法易受偏见影响，可能导致解释与用户实际偏好不符。

Method: 提出预过滤步骤，利用大语言模型过滤用户历史数据，再生成解释。

Result: 在公开数据集上测试，该方法生成的反事实解释比原方法更符合用户的流行度偏好。

Conclusion: 预过滤步骤能有效减少偏见，提升反事实解释的准确性。

Abstract: Counterfactual explanations (CFEs) offer a tangible and actionable way to
explain recommendations by showing users a "what-if" scenario that demonstrates
how small changes in their history would alter the system's output. However,
existing CFE methods are susceptible to bias, generating explanations that
might misalign with the user's actual preferences. In this paper, we propose a
pre-processing step that leverages large language models to filter
out-of-character history items before generating an explanation. In experiments
on two public datasets, we focus on popularity bias and apply our approach to
ACCENT, a neural CFE framework. We find that it creates counterfactuals that
are more closely aligned with each user's popularity preferences than ACCENT
alone.

TL;DR: 论文提出SPARC框架，通过动态离散兴趣空间和概率兴趣模块，解决推荐系统中多兴趣检索的静态和被动匹配问题，显著提升业务指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多兴趣检索方法无法动态适应用户实时偏好，且缺乏对新兴趣的主动探索。

Method: 使用RQ-VAE构建离散兴趣空间，结合概率兴趣模块实现动态兴趣挖掘和软搜索策略。

Result: 在线A/B测试显示用户观看时长增加0.9%，页面浏览量提升0.4%，新内容曝光率提高22.7%；离线实验在Recall@K和NDCG@K指标上也有提升。

Conclusion: SPARC框架有效解决了多兴趣检索的动态性和探索性问题，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Modeling multi-interests has arisen as a core problem in real-world RS.
Current multi-interest retrieval methods pose three major challenges: 1)
Interests, typically extracted from predefined external knowledge, are
invariant. Failed to dynamically evolve with users' real-time consumption
preferences. 2) Online inference typically employs an over-exploited strategy,
mainly matching users' existing interests, lacking proactive exploration and
discovery of novel and long-tail interests. To address these challenges, we
propose a novel retrieval framework named SPARC(Soft Probabilistic Adaptive
Retrieval Model via Codebooks). Our contribution is two folds. First, the
framework utilizes Residual Quantized Variational Autoencoder (RQ-VAE) to
construct a discretized interest space. It achieves joint training of the
RQ-VAE with the industrial large scale recommendation model, mining
behavior-aware interests that can perceive user feedback and evolve
dynamically. Secondly, a probabilistic interest module that predicts the
probability distribution over the entire dynamic and discrete interest space.
This facilitates an efficient "soft-search" strategy during online inference,
revolutionizing the retrieval paradigm from "passive matching" to "proactive
exploration" and thereby effectively promoting interest discovery. Online A/B
tests on an industrial platform with tens of millions daily active users, have
achieved substantial gains in business metrics: +0.9% increase in user view
duration, +0.4% increase in user page views (PV), and a +22.7% improvement in
PV500(new content reaching 500 PVs in 24 hours). Offline evaluations are
conducted on open-source Amazon Product datasets. Metrics, such as Recall@K and
Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain@K(NDCG@K), also showed consistent
improvement. Both online and offline experiments validate the efficacy and
practical value of the proposed method.
