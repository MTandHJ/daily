*Mohammad Zia Ur Rehman,Sufyaan Zahoor,Areeb Manzoor,Musharaf Maqbool,Nagendra Kumar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种多模态框架，用于检测社交媒体上针对女性的厌女和性别歧视内容，通过三个模块（MANM、GFRM、CFLM）提升检测效果，并在两个数据集上表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体上针对女性的攻击性内容较多，现有方法对此类内容的检测效果不佳，需要专门解决方案。

Method: 采用多模态框架，包含MANM（自适应门控多模态注意力）、GFRM（基于图的特征重构）和CFLM（内容特定特征学习），并结合厌女词典和测试时增强技术。

Result: 在MAMI和MMHS150K数据集上，平均宏F1分别提高了10.17%和8.88%。

Conclusion: 所提方法显著提升了厌女和性别歧视内容的检测性能，证明了多模态框架的有效性。

Abstract: A substantial portion of offensive content on social media is directed
towards women. Since the approaches for general offensive content detection
face a challenge in detecting misogynistic content, it requires solutions
tailored to address offensive content against women. To this end, we propose a
novel multimodal framework for the detection of misogynistic and sexist
content. The framework comprises three modules: the Multimodal Attention module
(MANM), the Graph-based Feature Reconstruction Module (GFRM), and the
Content-specific Features Learning Module (CFLM). The MANM employs adaptive
gating-based multimodal context-aware attention, enabling the model to focus on
relevant visual and textual information and generating contextually relevant
features. The GFRM module utilizes graphs to refine features within individual
modalities, while the CFLM focuses on learning text and image-specific features
such as toxicity features and caption features. Additionally, we curate a set
of misogynous lexicons to compute the misogyny-specific lexicon score from the
text. We apply test-time augmentation in feature space to better generalize the
predictions on diverse inputs. The performance of the proposed approach has
been evaluated on two multimodal datasets, MAMI and MMHS150K, with 11,000 and
13,494 samples, respectively. The proposed method demonstrates an average
improvement of 10.17% and 8.88% in macro-F1 over existing methods on the MAMI
and MMHS150K datasets, respectively.

### [2] [IAD-R1: Reinforcing Consistent Reasoning in Industrial Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09178)
*Yanhui Li,Yunkang Cao,Chengliang Liu,Yuan Xiong,Xinghui Dong,Chao Huang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IAD-R1是一个通用的后训练框架，显著提升视觉语言模型（VLMs）在工业异常检测中的性能，通过两阶段训练策略实现从异常感知到异常解释的飞跃。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业异常检测中缺陷样本稀缺，传统方法受限，而现有VLMs性能不足，需提升其泛化能力。

Method: 采用两阶段训练：PA-SFT阶段使用高质量Chain-of-Thought数据集增强异常感知；SC-GRPO阶段通过奖励函数实现异常解释。

Result: 在7种VLMs上平均准确率提升43.3%，0.5B参数模型在零样本设置下超越GPT-4.1等商业模型。

Conclusion: IAD-R1有效且优越，数据集和代码将公开。

Abstract: Industrial anomaly detection is a critical component of modern manufacturing,
yet the scarcity of defective samples restricts traditional detection methods
to scenario-specific applications. Although Vision-Language Models (VLMs)
demonstrate significant advantages in generalization capabilities, their
performance in industrial anomaly detection remains limited. To address this
challenge, we propose IAD-R1, a universal post-training framework applicable to
VLMs of different architectures and parameter scales, which substantially
enhances their anomaly detection capabilities. IAD-R1 employs a two-stage
training strategy: the Perception Activation Supervised Fine-Tuning (PA-SFT)
stage utilizes a meticulously constructed high-quality Chain-of-Thought dataset
(Expert-AD) for training, enhancing anomaly perception capabilities and
establishing reasoning-to-answer correlations; the Structured Control Group
Relative Policy Optimization (SC-GRPO) stage employs carefully designed reward
functions to achieve a capability leap from "Anomaly Perception" to "Anomaly
Interpretation". Experimental results demonstrate that IAD-R1 achieves
significant improvements across 7 VLMs, attaining up to 43.3% enhancement in
average accuracy on 6 industrial anomaly detection benchmark datasets. Notably,
the 0.5B parameter model trained with IAD-R1 surpasses commercial models
including GPT-4.1 and Claude-Sonnet-4 in zero-shot settings, demonstrating the
effectiveness and superiority of IAD-R1. The dataset, code, and all model
weights will be publicly available at https://github.com/Yanhui-Lee/IAD-R1.

### [3] [A Neurosymbolic Framework for Interpretable Cognitive Attack Detection in Augmented Reality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09185)
*Rongqian Chen,Allison Andreyev,Yanming Xiu,Mahdi Imani,Bin Li,Maria Gorlatova,Gang Tan,Tian Lan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CADAR是一种新颖的神经符号方法，用于检测AR中的认知攻击，结合了视觉语言模型的适应性和粒子滤波的严谨性，实验显示其准确性显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于AR的普及，认知攻击通过篡改AR内容操纵用户感知的问题日益突出，现有方法在语义推理和可解释性上存在局限。

Method: CADAR融合多模态视觉语言输入，构建符号感知图，结合先验知识和时间相关性，利用粒子滤波进行统计推理。

Result: 在扩展的AR认知攻击数据集上，CADAR比基线方法准确性提升高达10.7%。

Conclusion: 神经符号方法在有效性和可解释性方面展现出检测认知攻击的潜力。

Abstract: Augmented Reality (AR) enriches perception by overlaying virtual elements on
the physical world. Due to its growing popularity, cognitive attacks that alter
AR content to manipulate users' semantic perception have received increasing
attention. Existing detection methods often focus on visual changes, which are
restricted to pixel- or image-level processing and lack semantic reasoning
capabilities, or they rely on pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs), which
function as black-box approaches with limited interpretability. In this paper,
we present CADAR, a novel neurosymbolic approach for cognitive attack detection
in AR. It fuses multimodal vision-language inputs using neural VLMs to obtain a
symbolic perception-graph representation, incorporating prior knowledge,
salience weighting, and temporal correlations. The model then enables
particle-filter based statistical reasoning -- a sequential Monte Carlo method
-- to detect cognitive attacks. Thus, CADAR inherits the adaptability of
pre-trained VLM and the interpretability and reasoning rigor of particle
filtering. Experiments on an extended AR cognitive attack dataset show accuracy
improvements of up to 10.7% over strong baselines on challenging AR attack
scenarios, underscoring the promise of neurosymbolic methods for effective and
interpretable cognitive attack detection.

### [4] [RL-MoE: An Image-Based Privacy Preserving Approach In Intelligent Transportation System](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09186)
*Abdolazim Rezaei,Mehdi Sookhak,Mahboobeh Haghparast*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RL-MoE框架通过将敏感视觉数据转换为隐私保护文本描述，解决了智能交通系统中隐私与数据效用之间的冲突。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 智能交通系统中AI摄像头的普及导致隐私与数据需求之间的严重冲突，现有隐私保护机制不足。

Method: 结合Mixture-of-Experts架构和强化学习代理，生成兼具语义准确性和隐私保护的文本描述。

Result: RL-MoE显著降低重放攻击成功率至9.4%，同时生成更丰富的文本内容。

Conclusion: RL-MoE为隐私敏感领域提供了实用且可扩展的解决方案，推动更安全的智能城市和自动驾驶网络。

Abstract: The proliferation of AI-powered cameras in Intelligent Transportation Systems
(ITS) creates a severe conflict between the need for rich visual data and the
fundamental right to privacy. Existing privacy-preserving mechanisms, such as
blurring or encryption, are often insufficient, creating an undesirable
trade-off where either privacy is compromised against advanced reconstruction
attacks or data utility is critically degraded. To resolve this impasse, we
propose RL-MoE, a novel framework that transforms sensitive visual data into
privacy-preserving textual descriptions, eliminating the need for direct image
transmission. RL-MoE uniquely combines a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture
for nuanced, multi-aspect scene decomposition with a Reinforcement Learning
(RL) agent that optimizes the generated text for a dual objective of semantic
accuracy and privacy preservation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
RL-MoE provides superior privacy protection, reducing the success rate of
replay attacks to just 9.4\% on the CFP-FP dataset, while simultaneously
generating richer textual content than baseline methods. Our work provides a
practical and scalable solution for building trustworthy AI systems in
privacy-sensitive domains, paving the way for more secure smart city and
autonomous vehicle networks.

### [5] [Synthetic Data Generation for Emotional Depth Faces: Optimizing Conditional DCGANs via Genetic Algorithms in the Latent Space and Stabilizing Training with Knowledge Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09188)
*Seyed Muhammad Hossein Mousavi,S. Younes Mirinezhad*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于GAN和知识蒸馏的合成深度人脸生成框架，结合遗传算法优化潜在向量，提升了多样性和质量，并在分类任务中取得了高准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决情感计算中高质量、多样化深度面部数据集的缺乏问题。

Method: 使用优化的GAN和知识蒸馏（EMA教师模型）生成合成深度人脸，结合遗传算法优化潜在向量，提取多种特征进行分类。

Result: 在多样性和质量上优于GAN、VAE、GMM和KDE，分类准确率达94%和96%。

Conclusion: 该方法在生成和分类任务中均优于现有技术，为情感计算提供了高质量数据。

Abstract: Affective computing faces a major challenge: the lack of high-quality,
diverse depth facial datasets for recognizing subtle emotional expressions. We
propose a framework for synthetic depth face generation using an optimized GAN
with Knowledge Distillation (EMA teacher models) to stabilize training, improve
quality, and prevent mode collapse. We also apply Genetic Algorithms to evolve
GAN latent vectors based on image statistics, boosting diversity and visual
quality for target emotions. The approach outperforms GAN, VAE, GMM, and KDE in
both diversity and quality. For classification, we extract and concatenate LBP,
HOG, Sobel edge, and intensity histogram features, achieving 94% and 96%
accuracy with XGBoost. Evaluation using FID, IS, SSIM, and PSNR shows
consistent improvement over state-of-the-art methods.

### [6] [$Δ$-AttnMask: Attention-Guided Masked Hidden States for Efficient Data Selection and Augmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09199)
*Jucheng Hu,Suorong Yang,Dongzhan Zhou*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Δ-AttnMask的数据高效框架，用于视觉指令微调（VIF），通过注意力引导的隐藏状态掩码量化样本质量，仅需20%数据即可实现最优性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉指令微调（VIF）需要大量多模态数据，但数据选择方法研究不足，现有方法难以兼顾规模与质量。

Method: 提出Δ-AttnMask框架，通过计算原始状态与高注意力区域掩码状态的损失差异（Δ），评估样本质量，无需额外标签或训练。

Result: 实验表明，Δ-AttnMask仅用20%数据即可加速训练5倍，并在整体准确率上超越全数据集基线10.1%。

Conclusion: Δ-AttnMask是一种模型无关、数据无关的通用框架，适用于多种模态和架构。

Abstract: Visual Instruction Finetuning (VIF) is pivotal for post-training
Vision-Language Models (VLMs). Unlike unimodal instruction finetuning in
plain-text large language models, which mainly requires instruction datasets to
enable model instruction-following ability, VIF also requires multimodal data
to enable joint visual and textual understanding; therefore, it typically
requires more data. Consequently, VIF imposes stricter data selection
challenges: the method must scale efficiently to handle larger data demands
while ensuring the quality of both visual and textual content, as well as their
alignment. Despite its critical impact on performance, data selection for VIF
remains an understudied area. In this paper, we propose $\Delta$-AttnMask. This
data-efficient framework quantifies sample quality through attention-guided
masking of the model's hidden states, jointly evaluating image-text pairs
without requiring domain labels, auxiliary models, or extra training. By
computing loss differences ($\Delta$) between the original states and states
masked using high-attention regions, $\Delta$-AttnMask intrinsically assesses
sample quality. Experiments across multiple VLMs and datasets show that
$\Delta$-AttnMask achieves state-of-the-art performance with just 20% of data,
accelerating training by 5x while surpassing full-dataset baselines by +10.1%
in overall accuracy. Its model-agnostic and data-agnostic design ensures broad
applicability across modalities and architectures.

### [7] [Personalized Feature Translation for Expression Recognition: An Efficient Source-Free Domain Adaptation Method](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09202)
*Masoumeh Sharafi,Soufiane Belharbi,Houssem Ben Salem,Ali Etemad,Alessandro Lameiras Koerich,Marco Pedersoli,Simon Bacon,Eric Granger*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种轻量级的个性化特征翻译（PFT）方法，用于解决源数据不可用时仅通过未标记目标数据（仅中性表情）进行源自由域适应（SFDA）的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有SFDA方法通常不适用于仅含单类目标数据（如中性表情）的情况，且基于图像生成的方法不稳定且计算量大。

Method: PFT在潜在空间中进行特征翻译，避免了图像生成的复杂性。首先在源域数据上预训练翻译器，然后仅用中性目标数据适应翻译器，无需源数据或图像合成。

Result: PFT避免了表情生成的噪声和计算开销，生成优化的分类嵌入，方法高效且轻量。

Conclusion: PFT为源自由域适应提供了一种高效、轻量的解决方案，特别适用于目标数据仅含中性表情的场景。

Abstract: Facial expression recognition (FER) models are employed in many video-based
affective computing applications, such as human-computer interaction and
healthcare monitoring. However, deep FER models often struggle with subtle
expressions and high inter-subject variability, limiting their performance in
real-world applications. To improve their performance, source-free domain
adaptation (SFDA) methods have been proposed to personalize a pretrained source
model using only unlabeled target domain data, thereby avoiding data privacy,
storage, and transmission constraints. This paper addresses a challenging
scenario where source data is unavailable for adaptation, and only unlabeled
target data consisting solely of neutral expressions is available. SFDA methods
are not typically designed to adapt using target data from only a single class.
Further, using models to generate facial images with non-neutral expressions
can be unstable and computationally intensive. In this paper, personalized
feature translation (PFT) is proposed for SFDA. Unlike current image
translation methods for SFDA, our lightweight method operates in the latent
space. We first pre-train the translator on the source domain data to transform
the subject-specific style features from one source subject into another.
Expression information is preserved by optimizing a combination of expression
consistency and style-aware objectives. Then, the translator is adapted on
neutral target data, without using source data or image synthesis. By
translating in the latent space, PFT avoids the complexity and noise of face
expression generation, producing discriminative embeddings optimized for
classification. Using PFT eliminates the need for image synthesis, reduces
computational overhead (using a lightweight translator), and only adapts part
of the model, making the method efficient compared to image-based translation.

Abstract: The process of generating fully colorized drawings from sketches is a large,
usually costly bottleneck in the manga and anime industry. In this study, we
examine multiple models for image-to-image translation between anime characters
and their sketches, including Neural Style Transfer, C-GAN, and CycleGAN. By
assessing them qualitatively and quantitatively, we find that C-GAN is the most
effective model that is able to produce high-quality and high-resolution images
close to those created by humans.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种双架构框架，分别针对手语识别中的独立于说话者（SI）和未见句子（US）问题，通过新型网络结构显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决连续手语识别（CSLR）中的说话者间差异和未见句子结构泛化问题。

Method: 使用Signer-Invariant Conformer处理SI问题，结合卷积和多头自注意力；设计Multi-Scale Fusion Transformer处理US问题，采用双路径时间编码器。

Result: 在Isharah-1000数据集上，SI任务WER降至13.07%，US任务WER为47.78%，在SignEval 2025挑战赛中表现优异。

Conclusion: 任务特定网络设计显著提升CSLR性能，为未来研究设定了新基准。

Abstract: Continuous Sign Language Recognition (CSLR) faces multiple challenges,
including significant inter-signer variability and poor generalization to novel
sentence structures. Traditional solutions frequently fail to handle these
issues efficiently. For overcoming these constraints, we propose a
dual-architecture framework. For the Signer-Independent (SI) challenge, we
propose a Signer-Invariant Conformer that combines convolutions with multi-head
self-attention to learn robust, signer-agnostic representations from pose-based
skeletal keypoints. For the Unseen-Sentences (US) task, we designed a
Multi-Scale Fusion Transformer with a novel dual-path temporal encoder that
captures both fine-grained posture dynamics, enabling the model's ability to
comprehend novel grammatical compositions. Experiments on the challenging
Isharah-1000 dataset establish a new standard for both CSLR benchmarks. The
proposed conformer architecture achieves a Word Error Rate (WER) of 13.07% on
the SI challenge, a reduction of 13.53% from the state-of-the-art. On the US
task, the transformer model scores a WER of 47.78%, surpassing previous work.
In the SignEval 2025 CSLR challenge, our team placed 2nd in the US task and 4th
in the SI task, demonstrating the performance of these models. The findings
validate our key hypothesis: that developing task-specific networks designed
for the particular challenges of CSLR leads to considerable performance
improvements and establishes a new baseline for further research. The source

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MME-Emotion是一个系统性基准测试，用于评估多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）的情感情感和推理能力，包含6000多个视频片段和任务特定的问答对。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前情感基准测试的局限性在于无法评估MLLMs在不同场景中的泛化能力及其识别情绪触发因素的推理能力。

Method: 提出MME-Emotion基准测试，包含多样化的场景和任务，采用混合指标和多代理系统框架进行评估。

Result: 评估20个先进MLLMs，发现其情感情感表现不佳，最佳模型识别得分仅为39.3%，推理得分56.0%。

Conclusion: MME-Emotion可作为未来提升MLLMs情感情感能力的基础。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have catalyzed
transformative progress in affective computing, enabling models to exhibit
emergent emotional intelligence. Despite substantial methodological progress,
current emotional benchmarks remain limited, as it is still unknown: (a) the
generalization abilities of MLLMs across distinct scenarios, and (b) their
reasoning capabilities to identify the triggering factors behind emotional
states. To bridge these gaps, we present \textbf{MME-Emotion}, a systematic
benchmark that assesses both emotional understanding and reasoning capabilities
of MLLMs, enjoying \textit{scalable capacity}, \textit{diverse settings}, and
\textit{unified protocols}. As the largest emotional intelligence benchmark for
MLLMs, MME-Emotion contains over 6,000 curated video clips with task-specific
questioning-answering (QA) pairs, spanning broad scenarios to formulate eight
emotional tasks. It further incorporates a holistic evaluation suite with
hybrid metrics for emotion recognition and reasoning, analyzed through a
multi-agent system framework. Through a rigorous evaluation of 20 advanced
MLLMs, we uncover both their strengths and limitations, yielding several key
insights: \ding{182} Current MLLMs exhibit unsatisfactory emotional
intelligence, with the best-performing model achieving only $39.3\%$
recognition score and $56.0\%$ Chain-of-Thought (CoT) score on our benchmark.
\ding{183} Generalist models (\emph{e.g.}, Gemini-2.5-Pro) derive emotional
intelligence from generalized multimodal understanding capabilities, while
specialist models (\emph{e.g.}, R1-Omni) can achieve comparable performance
through domain-specific post-training adaptation. By introducing MME-Emotion,
we hope that it can serve as a foundation for advancing MLLMs' emotional
intelligence in the future.

### [11] [Towards Effective MLLM Jailbreaking Through Balanced On-Topicness and OOD-Intensity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09218)
*Zuoou Li,Weitong Zhang,Jingyuan Wang,Shuyuan Zhang,Wenjia Bai,Bernhard Kainz,Mengyun Qiao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种四轴评估框架和递归重写策略（BSD），用于更准确地评估和提升多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）对抗性提示的攻击效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前对抗性提示的评估标准可能高估了攻击效果，且安全机制无法有效阻止有害输出，因此需要更精确的评估方法和攻击策略。

Method: 引入四轴评估框架（输入相关性、输入OOD强度、输出有害性、输出拒绝率）和递归重写策略BSD，平衡相关性和新颖性以绕过安全检测。

Result: BSD在13个MLLMs中显著提高了攻击成功率（67%）和输出有害性（21%），揭示了现有安全系统的弱点。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了MLLMs安全系统的结构性缺陷，BSD方法为未来安全防御提供了改进方向。

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are widely used in vision-language
reasoning tasks. However, their vulnerability to adversarial prompts remains a
serious concern, as safety mechanisms often fail to prevent the generation of
harmful outputs. Although recent jailbreak strategies report high success
rates, many responses classified as "successful" are actually benign, vague, or
unrelated to the intended malicious goal. This mismatch suggests that current
evaluation standards may overestimate the effectiveness of such attacks. To
address this issue, we introduce a four-axis evaluation framework that
considers input on-topicness, input out-of-distribution (OOD) intensity, output
harmfulness, and output refusal rate. This framework identifies truly effective
jailbreaks. In a substantial empirical study, we reveal a structural trade-off:
highly on-topic prompts are frequently blocked by safety filters, whereas those
that are too OOD often evade detection but fail to produce harmful content.
However, prompts that balance relevance and novelty are more likely to evade
filters and trigger dangerous output. Building on this insight, we develop a
recursive rewriting strategy called Balanced Structural Decomposition (BSD).
The approach restructures malicious prompts into semantically aligned
sub-tasks, while introducing subtle OOD signals and visual cues that make the
inputs harder to detect. BSD was tested across 13 commercial and open-source
MLLMs, where it consistently led to higher attack success rates, more harmful
outputs, and fewer refusals. Compared to previous methods, it improves success
rates by $67\%$ and harmfulness by $21\%$, revealing a previously
underappreciated weakness in current multimodal safety systems.

Motivation: 手写数学表达式识别（HMER）领域因数据稀缺而受限，主要由于手动标注成本高昂。

Method: 开发可扩展的数据引擎，结合有限手写公式和大规模LaTeX渲染公式，构建Tex80M数据集，并训练HMER模型TexTeller。

Result: TexTeller在几乎所有基准测试中达到SOTA性能。

Conclusion: 将公开模型、数据集和代码，推动HMER领域进一步发展。

Abstract: Large foundation models have achieved significant performance gains through
scalable training on massive datasets. However, the field of
\textbf{H}andwritten \textbf{M}athematical \textbf{E}xpression
\textbf{R}ecognition (HMER) has been impeded by the scarcity of data, primarily
due to the arduous and costly process of manual annotation. To bridge this gap,
we propose a novel method integrating limited handwritten formulas with
large-scale LaTeX-rendered formulas by developing a scalable data engine to
generate complex and consistent LaTeX sequences. With this engine, we built the
largest formula dataset to date, termed \texttt{Tex80M}, comprising over 80
million high-quality training instances. Then we propose \texttt{TexTeller},
the first HMER model trained at scale, by mix-training \texttt{Tex80M} with a
relatively small HME dataset. The expansive training dataset and our refined
pipeline have equipped \texttt{TexTeller} with state-of-the-art (SOTA)
performance across nearly all benchmarks. To advance the field, we will openly
release our complete model, entire dataset, and full codebase, enabling further
research building upon our contributions.

TL;DR: GDAGS提出了一种基于梯度方向感知的自适应密度控制框架，解决了3D高斯溅射中的过重建和过密集问题，显著提升了渲染质量和内存效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D高斯溅射方法在复杂场景中存在过重建和过密集问题，导致内存开销增加和渲染质量下降。

Method: GDAGS通过梯度一致性比（GCR）和非线性动态加权机制，实现梯度方向感知的密度控制，优化高斯分布。

Result: GDAGS在多种真实场景基准测试中表现出色，渲染质量提升，内存消耗减少50%。

Conclusion: GDAGS通过梯度方向感知的密度控制，有效解决了3D高斯溅射中的关键问题，为实时渲染提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: The emergence of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has significantly advanced
novel view synthesis through explicit scene representation, enabling real-time
photorealistic rendering. However, existing approaches manifest two critical
limitations in complex scenarios: (1) Over-reconstruction occurs when
persistent large Gaussians cannot meet adaptive splitting thresholds during
density control. This is exacerbated by conflicting gradient directions that
prevent effective splitting of these Gaussians; (2) Over-densification of
Gaussians occurs in regions with aligned gradient aggregation, leading to
redundant component proliferation. This redundancy significantly increases
memory overhead due to unnecessary data retention. We present
Gradient-Direction-Aware Gaussian Splatting (GDAGS), a gradient-direction-aware
adaptive density control framework to address these challenges. Our key
innovations: the gradient coherence ratio (GCR), computed through normalized
gradient vector norms, which explicitly discriminates Gaussians with concordant
versus conflicting gradient directions; and a nonlinear dynamic weighting
mechanism leverages the GCR to enable gradient-direction-aware density control.
Specifically, GDAGS prioritizes conflicting-gradient Gaussians during splitting
operations to enhance geometric details while suppressing redundant
concordant-direction Gaussians. Conversely, in cloning processes, GDAGS
promotes concordant-direction Gaussian densification for structural completion
while preventing conflicting-direction Gaussian overpopulation. Comprehensive
evaluations across diverse real-world benchmarks demonstrate that GDAGS
achieves superior rendering quality while effectively mitigating
over-reconstruction, suppressing over-densification, and constructing compact
scene representations with 50\% reduced memory consumption through optimized
Gaussians utilization.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of generative artificial intelligence technology,
Graphical User Interface (GUI) agents have demonstrated tremendous potential
for autonomously managing daily tasks through natural language instructions.
However, current evaluation frameworks for GUI agents suffer from fundamental
flaws: existing benchmarks overly focus on coarse-grained task completion while
neglecting fine-grained control capabilities crucial for real-world
applications. To address this, we introduce FineState-Bench, the first
evaluation and diagnostic standard for fine-grained GUI proxy operations,
designed to quantify fine-grained control. This multi-platform (desktop, Web,
mobile) framework includes 2257 task benchmarks in four components and uses a
four-phase indicator for comprehensive perception-to-control assessment. To
analyze perception and positioning for refined operations, we developed the
plug-and-play Visual Diagnostic Assistant (VDA), enabling the first
quantitative decoupling analysis of these capabilities. Experimental results on
our benchmark show that the most advanced models achieve only 32.8%
fine-grained interaction accuracy. Using our VDA in controlled experiments,
quantifying the impact of visual capabilities, we showed that ideal visual
localization boosts Gemini-2.5-Flash's success rate by 14.9\%. Our diagnostic
framework confirms for the first time that the primary bottleneck for current
GUI proxies is basic visual positioning capability.All resources are fully

TL;DR: FiGPriv是一种细粒度隐私保护框架，选择性屏蔽高风险隐私信息，保留低风险信息，提升视觉语言模型的可用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着视觉语言模型（VLMs）的普及，盲人和低视力用户可能无意中捕获隐私信息，现有隐私保护方法因粗粒度分割导致可用性降低。

Method: 结合细粒度分割与数据驱动的风险评分机制，提出FiGPriv框架。

Result: 在BIV-Priv-Seg数据集上，FiGPriv保留26%的图像内容，提升VLM响应能力11%，识别图像内容能力45%。

Conclusion: FiGPriv在保护隐私的同时显著提升了视觉语言模型的可用性和功能。

Abstract: As visual assistant systems powered by visual language models (VLMs) become
more prevalent, concerns over user privacy have grown, particularly for blind
and low vision users who may unknowingly capture personal private information
in their images. Existing privacy protection methods rely on coarse-grained
segmentation, which uniformly masks entire private objects, often at the cost
of usability. In this work, we propose FiGPriv, a fine-grained privacy
protection framework that selectively masks only high-risk private information
while preserving low-risk information. Our approach integrates fine-grained
segmentation with a data-driven risk scoring mechanism. We evaluate our
framework using the BIV-Priv-Seg dataset and show that FiG-Priv preserves +26%
of image content, enhancing the ability of VLMs to provide useful responses by
11% and identify the image content by 45%, while ensuring privacy protection.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新颖的输入自适应导航方法，通过三种算法提升视觉与语言导航（VLN）模型的效率，显著减少了计算量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有输入自适应机制在减少计算量时会导致性能显著下降，因此需要更高效的方法。

Method: 提出了三种自适应算法：选择性处理全景视图（空间效率）、基于重要性的自适应阈值（模型内效率）和缓存机制（时间效率）。

Result: 在七个VLN基准测试中，计算量减少了2倍以上，且性能未显著下降。

Conclusion: 该方法显著提升了VLN模型的效率，适用于计算资源有限的场景。

Abstract: An emerging paradigm in vision-and-language navigation (VLN) is the use of
history-aware multi-modal transformer models. Given a language instruction,
these models process observation and navigation history to predict the most
appropriate action for an agent. While they have significantly improved
performance, the scale of these models can be a bottleneck in practical
settings with limited computational resources. In this work, we propose a novel
input-adaptive navigation method to enhance VLN model efficiency. We first show
that existing input-adaptive mechanisms fail to reduce computations without
substantial performance degradation. To address this, we introduce three
adaptive algorithms, each deployed at a different level: (1) To improve spatial
efficiency, we selectively process panoramic views at each observation of an
agent. (2) To improve intra-model efficiency, we propose importance-based
adaptive thresholding for the early-exit methods. (3) To improve temporal
efficiency, we implement a caching mechanism that prevents reprocessing of
views previously seen by the agent. In evaluations on seven VLN benchmarks, we
demonstrate over a 2$\times$ reduction in computation across three
off-the-shelf agents in both standard and continuous environments. Our code is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉强化学习面临高维输入和噪声奖励的挑战，现有感知模型难以有效整合到RL中。

Method: SegDAC结合SAM和YOLO-World进行对象分割和语义标注，采用动态Transformer架构，通过在线RL学习关注关键片段。

Result: 在Maniskill3基准测试中，SegDAC在视觉泛化能力上显著优于现有方法，样本效率也达到或超越先前水平。

Conclusion: SegDAC通过对象中心分割和动态注意力机制，有效提升了视觉强化学习的泛化能力和效率。

Abstract: Visual reinforcement learning (RL) is challenging due to the need to learn
both perception and actions from high-dimensional inputs and noisy rewards.
Although large perception models exist, integrating them effectively into RL
for visual generalization and improved sample efficiency remains unclear. We
propose SegDAC, a Segmentation-Driven Actor-Critic method. SegDAC uses Segment
Anything (SAM) for object-centric decomposition and YOLO-World to ground
segments semantically via text prompts. It includes a novel transformer-based
architecture that supports a dynamic number of segments at each time step and
effectively learns which segments to focus on using online RL, without using
human labels. By evaluating SegDAC over a challenging visual generalization
benchmark using Maniskill3, which covers diverse manipulation tasks under
strong visual perturbations, we demonstrate that SegDAC achieves significantly
better visual generalization, doubling prior performance on the hardest setting
and matching or surpassing prior methods in sample efficiency across all
evaluated tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有生成模型在肺癌诊断中效率低且解剖学不精确，限制了临床应用。

Method: 提出Lung-DDPM+，结合结节语义布局和肺部DPM-solver加速，优化采样效率和质量。

Result: 在LIDC-IDRI数据集上，FLOPs减少8倍，GPU内存消耗降低6.8倍，采样速度提升14倍，同时保持样本质量。

Conclusion: Lung-DDPM+能高效生成高质量肺部CT图像，具有广泛临床应用潜力。

Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence (AI) has been playing an important role in
various domains. Leveraging its high capability to generate high-fidelity and
diverse synthetic data, generative AI is widely applied in diagnostic tasks,
such as lung cancer diagnosis using computed tomography (CT). However, existing
generative models for lung cancer diagnosis suffer from low efficiency and
anatomical imprecision, which limit their clinical applicability. To address
these drawbacks, we propose Lung-DDPM+, an improved version of our previous
model, Lung-DDPM. This novel approach is a denoising diffusion probabilistic
model (DDPM) guided by nodule semantic layouts and accelerated by a pulmonary
DPM-solver, enabling the method to focus on lesion areas while achieving a
better trade-off between sampling efficiency and quality. Evaluation results on
the public LIDC-IDRI dataset suggest that the proposed method achieves
8$\times$ fewer FLOPs (floating point operations per second), 6.8$\times$ lower
GPU memory consumption, and 14$\times$ faster sampling compared to Lung-DDPM.
Moreover, it maintains comparable sample quality to both Lung-DDPM and other
state-of-the-art (SOTA) generative models in two downstream segmentation tasks.
We also conducted a Visual Turing Test by an experienced radiologist, showing
the advanced quality and fidelity of synthetic samples generated by the
proposed method. These experimental results demonstrate that Lung-DDPM+ can
effectively generate high-quality thoracic CT images with lung nodules,
highlighting its potential for broader applications, such as general tumor
synthesis and lesion generation in medical imaging. The code and pretrained
models are available at https://github.com/Manem-Lab/Lung-DDPM-PLUS.

Conclusion: 基于注意力融合的多样化时空网络集成方法为复杂多模态手势识别提供了鲁棒且准确的框架。

Abstract: Accurate recognition of sign language in healthcare communication poses a
significant challenge, requiring frameworks that can accurately interpret
complex multimodal gestures. To deal with this, we propose FusionEnsemble-Net,
a novel attention-based ensemble of spatiotemporal networks that dynamically
fuses visual and motion data to enhance recognition accuracy. The proposed
approach processes RGB video and range Doppler map radar modalities
synchronously through four different spatiotemporal networks. For each network,
features from both modalities are continuously fused using an attention-based
fusion module before being fed into an ensemble of classifiers. Finally, the
outputs of these four different fused channels are combined in an ensemble
classification head, thereby enhancing the model's robustness. Experiments
demonstrate that FusionEnsemble-Net outperforms state-of-the-art approaches
with a test accuracy of 99.44% on the large-scale MultiMeDaLIS dataset for
Italian Sign Language. Our findings indicate that an ensemble of diverse
spatiotemporal networks, unified by attention-based fusion, yields a robust and
accurate framework for complex, multimodal isolated gesture recognition tasks.

TL;DR: 论文研究了医学图像分割中注释者间的变异性，发现注释者间一致性（IAA）与皮肤病变的恶性程度显著相关，并提出了一种利用IAA作为软临床特征的多任务学习方法，提高了模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医学图像分割中注释者的变异性（如边界模糊、注释者偏好等）影响分割结果，尤其是恶性病变。研究旨在量化这种变异性并探索其与恶性程度的关系。

Method: 构建了IMA++数据集，分析了注释者、恶性程度等因素对IAA的影响，并开发了一种基于IAA预测的多任务学习框架。

Result: 发现IAA与恶性程度显著相关（p<0.001），IAA预测误差为0.108，多任务学习方法平均提升了4.2%的平衡准确率。

Conclusion: IAA可作为临床特征的补充，多任务学习方法有效利用了注释者变异性，提升了模型性能。

Abstract: Medical image segmentation exhibits intra- and inter-annotator variability
due to ambiguous object boundaries, annotator preferences, expertise, and
tools, among other factors. Lesions with ambiguous boundaries, e.g., spiculated
or infiltrative nodules, or irregular borders per the ABCD rule, are
particularly prone to disagreement and are often associated with malignancy. In
this work, we curate IMA++, the largest multi-annotator skin lesion
segmentation dataset, on which we conduct an in-depth study of variability due
to annotator, malignancy, tool, and skill factors. We find a statistically
significant (p<0.001) association between inter-annotator agreement (IAA),
measured using Dice, and the malignancy of skin lesions. We further show that
IAA can be accurately predicted directly from dermoscopic images, achieving a
mean absolute error of 0.108. Finally, we leverage this association by
utilizing IAA as a "soft" clinical feature within a multi-task learning
objective, yielding a 4.2% improvement in balanced accuracy averaged across
multiple model architectures and across IMA++ and four public dermoscopic
datasets. The code is available at https://github.com/sfu-mial/skin-IAV.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖显式骨骼姿势和启发式跨身份调整，难以实现高保真和身份无关的运动迁移。

Method: 通过四组解耦的潜在令牌（面部、身体、双手）编码运动，结合自监督框架和DiT生成模型，利用2D/3D增强和辅助解码器优化学习。

Result: 实验表明，X-UniMotion在运动保真度和身份保留方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: X-UniMotion提供了一种高效且表达丰富的运动表示方法，适用于复杂的人体动画生成。

Abstract: We present X-UniMotion, a unified and expressive implicit latent
representation for whole-body human motion, encompassing facial expressions,
body poses, and hand gestures. Unlike prior motion transfer methods that rely
on explicit skeletal poses and heuristic cross-identity adjustments, our
approach encodes multi-granular motion directly from a single image into a
compact set of four disentangled latent tokens -- one for facial expression,
one for body pose, and one for each hand. These motion latents are both highly
expressive and identity-agnostic, enabling high-fidelity, detailed
cross-identity motion transfer across subjects with diverse identities, poses,
and spatial configurations. To achieve this, we introduce a self-supervised,
end-to-end framework that jointly learns the motion encoder and latent
representation alongside a DiT-based video generative model, trained on
large-scale, diverse human motion datasets. Motion-identity disentanglement is
enforced via 2D spatial and color augmentations, as well as synthetic 3D
renderings of cross-identity subject pairs under shared poses. Furthermore, we
guide motion token learning with auxiliary decoders that promote fine-grained,
semantically aligned, and depth-aware motion embeddings. Extensive experiments
show that X-UniMotion outperforms state-of-the-art methods, producing highly
expressive animations with superior motion fidelity and identity preservation.

Conclusion: DenoDet V2通过变换域特征调制显著提升了SAR目标检测性能，且模型更高效。

Abstract: One of the primary challenges in Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) object
detection lies in the pervasive influence of coherent noise. As a common
practice, most existing methods, whether handcrafted approaches or deep
learning-based methods, employ the analysis or enhancement of object
spatial-domain characteristics to achieve implicit denoising. In this paper, we
propose DenoDet V2, which explores a completely novel and different perspective
to deconstruct and modulate the features in the transform domain via a
carefully designed attention architecture. Compared to DenoDet V1, DenoDet V2
is a major advancement that exploits the complementary nature of amplitude and
phase information through a band-wise mutual modulation mechanism, which
enables a reciprocal enhancement between phase and amplitude spectra. Extensive
experiments on various SAR datasets demonstrate the state-of-the-art
performance of DenoDet V2. Notably, DenoDet V2 achieves a significant 0.8\%
improvement on SARDet-100K dataset compared to DenoDet V1, while reducing the
model complexity by half. The code is available at

Abstract: This paper presents a low cost, on premise system for autonomous backyard

short clips via FTP to a local server, where frames are sampled and birds are
localized with Detectron2; cropped regions are then classified by an
EfficientNet-B3 model fine tuned on a 40-species Belgian subset derived from a
larger Kaggle corpus. All processing runs on commodity hardware without a
discrete GPU, preserving privacy and avoiding cloud fees. The physical feeder
uses small entry ports (30 mm) to exclude pigeons and reduce nuisance triggers.
Detector-guided cropping improves classification accuracy over raw-frame
classification. The classifier attains high validation performance on the
curated subset (about 99.5 percent) and delivers practical field accuracy
(top-1 about 88 percent) on held-out species, demonstrating feasibility for
citizen-science-grade biodiversity logging at home.

Abstract: Large-scale high-quality 3D motion datasets with multi-person interactions
are crucial for data-driven models in autonomous driving to achieve
fine-grained pedestrian interaction understanding in dynamic urban
environments. However, existing datasets mostly rely on estimating 3D poses
from monocular RGB video frames, which suffer from occlusion and lack of
temporal continuity, thus resulting in unrealistic and low-quality human
motion. In this paper, we introduce Waymo-3DSkelMo, the first large-scale
dataset providing high-quality, temporally coherent 3D skeletal motions with
explicit interaction semantics, derived from the Waymo Perception dataset. Our
key insight is to utilize 3D human body shape and motion priors to enhance the
quality of the 3D pose sequences extracted from the raw LiDRA point clouds. The
dataset covers over 14,000 seconds across more than 800 real driving scenarios,
including rich interactions among an average of 27 agents per scene (with up to
250 agents in the largest scene). Furthermore, we establish 3D pose forecasting
benchmarks under varying pedestrian densities, and the results demonstrate its
value as a foundational resource for future research on fine-grained human
behavior understanding in complex urban environments. The dataset and code will

Conclusion: 贡献了首个大规模高质量路缘坡道数据集和模型，性能显著提升。

Abstract: Curb ramps are critical for urban accessibility, but robustly detecting them
in images remains an open problem due to the lack of large-scale, high-quality
datasets. While prior work has attempted to improve data availability with
crowdsourced or manually labeled data, these efforts often fall short in either
quality or scale. In this paper, we introduce and evaluate a two-stage pipeline
called RampNet to scale curb ramp detection datasets and improve model
performance. In Stage 1, we generate a dataset of more than 210,000 annotated
Google Street View (GSV) panoramas by auto-translating government-provided curb
ramp location data to pixel coordinates in panoramic images. In Stage 2, we
train a curb ramp detection model (modified ConvNeXt V2) from the generated
dataset, achieving state-of-the-art performance. To evaluate both stages of our
pipeline, we compare to manually labeled panoramas. Our generated dataset
achieves 94.0% precision and 92.5% recall, and our detection model reaches
0.9236 AP -- far exceeding prior work. Our work contributes the first
large-scale, high-quality curb ramp detection dataset, benchmark, and model.

TL;DR: GOAL提出了一种基于生成流的框架，通过结合LLM增强的全场景语义地图，建模室内环境的语义分布，显著提升了ObjectNav任务的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖确定性模型完成语义地图，忽略了室内布局的不确定性，限制了泛化能力。GOAL旨在解决这一问题。

Method: 利用LLM推断的空间先验，编码为二维高斯场并注入目标地图，通过生成流模型实现更通用的语义补全。

Result: 在MP3D和Gibson上达到SOTA性能，在HM3D上表现出强泛化能力。

Conclusion: GOAL通过生成流模型和LLM先验的结合，显著提升了ObjectNav任务的性能与泛化能力。

Abstract: The Object Goal Navigation (ObjectNav) task challenges agents to locate a
specified object in an unseen environment by imagining unobserved regions of
the scene. Prior approaches rely on deterministic and discriminative models to
complete semantic maps, overlooking the inherent uncertainty in indoor layouts
and limiting their ability to generalize to unseen environments. In this work,
we propose GOAL, a generative flow-based framework that models the semantic
distribution of indoor environments by bridging observed regions with
LLM-enriched full-scene semantic maps. During training, spatial priors inferred
from large language models (LLMs) are encoded as two-dimensional Gaussian
fields and injected into target maps, distilling rich contextual knowledge into
the flow model and enabling more generalizable completions. Extensive

*Yuxiao Wang,Yu Lei,Wolin Liang,Weiying Xue,Zhenao Wei,Nan Zhuang,Qi Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新视觉任务，同时预测高级动作语义和细粒度身体部位接触区域，并提出了PaIR-Net框架和PaIR数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法未能同时建模动作语义和空间上下文，需填补这一空白。

Method: PaIR-Net框架包含三个模块：CPAM识别接触相关身体部位，PGCS进行像素级接触分割，IIM整合全局交互关系。

Result: 实验表明PaIR-Net显著优于基线方法，消融研究验证了各模块的有效性。

Conclusion: PaIR-Net和PaIR数据集为动作理解提供了新视角，代码和数据集将公开。

Abstract: People control their bodies to establish contact with the environment. To
comprehensively understand actions across diverse visual contexts, it is
essential to simultaneously consider \textbf{what} action is occurring and
\textbf{where} it is happening. Current methodologies, however, often
inadequately capture this duality, typically failing to jointly model both
action semantics and their spatial contextualization within scenes. To bridge
this gap, we introduce a novel vision task that simultaneously predicts
high-level action semantics and fine-grained body-part contact regions. Our
proposed framework, PaIR-Net, comprises three key components: the Contact Prior
Aware Module (CPAM) for identifying contact-relevant body parts, the
Prior-Guided Concat Segmenter (PGCS) for pixel-wise contact segmentation, and
the Interaction Inference Module (IIM) responsible for integrating global
interaction relationships. To facilitate this task, we present PaIR (Part-aware
Interaction Representation), a comprehensive dataset containing 13,979 images
that encompass 654 actions, 80 object categories, and 17 body parts.
Experimental evaluation demonstrates that PaIR-Net significantly outperforms
baseline approaches, while ablation studies confirm the efficacy of each
architectural component. The code and dataset will be released upon
publication.

*Jiateng Liu,Hengcan Shi,Feng Chen,Zhiwen Shao,Yaonan Wang,Jianfei Cai,Wenming Zheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为Motion Prompt Tuning (MPT)的新方法，通过微调大型预训练模型（LMs）来改进微表情识别（MER），解决了现有方法难以捕捉细微面部运动的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 微表情识别在医疗诊断、测谎等领域有广泛应用，但由于标注困难，数据集样本稀缺，限制了模型学习。现有大型预训练模型难以直接应用于MER，因其无法捕捉细微面部运动。

Method: 提出MPT方法，包括运动提示生成（运动放大和高斯标记化）和组适配器设计，以增强模型对微表情的识别能力。

Result: 在三个广泛使用的MER数据集上的实验表明，MPT方法优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: MPT通过运动提示调优和组适配器设计，显著提升了MER性能，验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Micro-expression recognition (MER) is crucial in the affective computing
field due to its wide application in medical diagnosis, lie detection, and
criminal investigation. Despite its significance, obtaining micro-expression
(ME) annotations is challenging due to the expertise required from
psychological professionals. Consequently, ME datasets often suffer from a
scarcity of training samples, severely constraining the learning of MER models.
While current large pre-training models (LMs) offer general and discriminative
representations, their direct application to MER is hindered by an inability to
capture transitory and subtle facial movements-essential elements for effective
MER. This paper introduces Motion Prompt Tuning (MPT) as a novel approach to
adapting LMs for MER, representing a pioneering method for subtle motion prompt
tuning. Particularly, we introduce motion prompt generation, including motion
magnification and Gaussian tokenization, to extract subtle motions as prompts
for LMs. Additionally, a group adapter is carefully designed and inserted into
the LM to enhance it in the target MER domain, facilitating a more nuanced
distinction of ME representation. Furthermore, extensive experiments conducted
on three widely used MER datasets demonstrate that our proposed MPT
consistently surpasses state-of-the-art approaches and verifies its
effectiveness.

*Jiaqi Yan,Shuning Xu,Xiangyu Chen,Dell Zhang,Jie Tang,Gangshan Wu,Jie Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新的基于检索的超分辨率方法（RASR），通过自动从参考数据库中检索高分辨率图像来提升低质量输入图像的分辨率，解决了现有方法依赖手动配对的限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于参考的超分辨率方法（RefSR）依赖手动配对的参考图像，限制了其实际应用。为了解决这一问题，作者提出了RASR方法，通过自动检索相关参考图像，提升方法的实用性和灵活性。

Method: 作者提出了RASRNet，结合了语义参考检索器和基于扩散的超分辨率生成器。检索器根据语义相似性找到相关参考图像，生成器通过语义条件增强生成高分辨率图像。

Result: 在RASR-Flickr30数据集上的实验表明，RASRNet相比传统单图像超分辨率方法（SISR）提升了0.38 dB PSNR和-0.0131 LPIPS，生成了更真实的纹理。

Conclusion: 检索增强是连接学术研究和实际应用的有前景的方向，RASRNet展示了其在提升超分辨率任务中的潜力。

Abstract: Reference-based Super Resolution (RefSR) improves upon Single Image Super
Resolution (SISR) by leveraging high-quality reference images to enhance
texture fidelity and visual realism. However, a critical limitation of existing
RefSR approaches is their reliance on manually curated target-reference image
pairs, which severely constrains their practicality in real-world scenarios. To
overcome this, we introduce Retrieval-Augmented Super Resolution (RASR), a new
and practical RefSR paradigm that automatically retrieves semantically relevant
high-resolution images from a reference database given only a low-quality
input. This enables scalable and flexible RefSR in realistic use cases, such as
enhancing mobile photos taken in environments like zoos or museums, where
category-specific reference data (e.g., animals, artworks) can be readily
collected or pre-curated. To facilitate research in this direction, we
construct RASR-Flickr30, the first benchmark dataset designed for RASR. Unlike
prior datasets with fixed target-reference pairs, RASR-Flickr30 provides
per-category reference databases to support open-world retrieval. We further
propose RASRNet, a strong baseline that combines a semantic reference retriever
with a diffusion-based RefSR generator. It retrieves relevant references based
on semantic similarity and employs a diffusion-based generator enhanced with
semantic conditioning. Experiments on RASR-Flickr30 demonstrate that RASRNet
consistently improves over SISR baselines, achieving +0.38 dB PSNR and -0.0131
LPIPS, while generating more realistic textures. These findings highlight
retrieval augmentation as a promising direction to bridge the gap between
academic RefSR research and real-world applicability.

TL;DR: HyperKD是一种新颖的知识蒸馏框架，通过逆向知识转移解决高光谱遥感中基础模型应用的挑战，显著提升了表示学习和下游任务性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基础模型在大规模无标签数据集上预训练后，可直接用于多种下游任务，但在高光谱遥感中因光谱差异和数据稀缺而难以直接应用。

Method: HyperKD通过特征对齐、空间特征引导掩码和增强损失函数，从Prithvi基础模型向EnMAP高光谱图像学生模型进行逆向知识蒸馏。

Result: 实验表明，HyperKD显著改善了MAE的表示学习，提升了重建保真度和下游任务（如土地覆盖分类、作物类型识别和土壤有机碳预测）的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: HyperKD填补了光谱域差距，展示了知识蒸馏框架在高光谱遥感分析中的潜力。

Abstract: The proliferation of foundation models, pretrained on large-scale unlabeled
datasets, has emerged as an effective approach in creating adaptable and
reusable architectures that can be leveraged for various downstream tasks using
satellite observations. However, their direct application to hyperspectral
remote sensing remains challenging due to inherent spectral disparities and the
scarcity of available observations. In this work, we present HyperKD, a novel
knowledge distillation framework that enables transferring learned
representations from a teacher model into a student model for effective
development of a foundation model on hyperspectral images. Unlike typical
knowledge distillation frameworks, which use a complex teacher to guide a
simpler student, HyperKD enables an inverse form of knowledge transfer across
different types of spectral data, guided by a simpler teacher model. Building
upon a Masked Autoencoder, HyperKD distills knowledge from the Prithvi
foundational model into a student tailored for EnMAP hyperspectral imagery.
HyperKD addresses the inverse domain adaptation problem with spectral gaps by
introducing a feature-based strategy that includes spectral range-based channel
alignment, spatial feature-guided masking, and an enhanced loss function
tailored for hyperspectral images. HyperKD bridges the substantial spectral
domain gap, enabling the effective use of pretrained foundation models for
geospatial applications. Extensive experiments show that HyperKD significantly
improves representation learning in MAEs, leading to enhanced reconstruction
fidelity and more robust performance on downstream tasks such as land cover
classification, crop type identification, and soil organic carbon prediction,
underpinning the potential of knowledge distillation frameworks in remote
sensing analytics with hyperspectral imagery.

TL;DR: Animate-X++ 是一个基于 DiT 的通用动画框架，适用于多种角色类型，包括拟人化角色，通过 Pose Indicator 增强运动表示，并结合多任务训练策略实现更真实的视频生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要适用于人类角色，对拟人化角色泛化能力不足，且只能生成静态背景视频，限制了视频的真实性。

Method: 提出 Pose Indicator，通过隐式和显式方式捕捉驱动视频的运动模式；采用多任务训练策略，结合动画和 TI2V 任务。

Result: 实验表明 Animate-X++ 在通用性和适用性上表现优越。

Conclusion: Animate-X++ 解决了现有方法的局限性，实现了更广泛和真实的角色动画生成。

Abstract: Character image animation, which generates high-quality videos from a
reference image and target pose sequence, has seen significant progress in
recent years. However, most existing methods only apply to human figures, which
usually do not generalize well on anthropomorphic characters commonly used in
industries like gaming and entertainment. Furthermore, previous methods could
only generate videos with static backgrounds, which limits the realism of the
videos. For the first challenge, our in-depth analysis suggests to attribute
this limitation to their insufficient modeling of motion, which is unable to
comprehend the movement pattern of the driving video, thus imposing a pose
sequence rigidly onto the target character. To this end, this paper proposes
Animate-X++, a universal animation framework based on DiT for various character
types, including anthropomorphic characters. To enhance motion representation,
we introduce the Pose Indicator, which captures comprehensive motion pattern
from the driving video through both implicit and explicit manner. The former
leverages CLIP visual features of a driving video to extract its gist of
motion, like the overall movement pattern and temporal relations among motions,
while the latter strengthens the generalization of DiT by simulating possible
inputs in advance that may arise during inference. For the second challenge, we
introduce a multi-task training strategy that jointly trains the animation and
TI2V tasks. Combined with the proposed partial parameter training, this
approach achieves not only character animation but also text-driven background
dynamics, making the videos more realistic. Moreover, we introduce a new
Animated Anthropomorphic Benchmark (A2Bench) to evaluate the performance of
Animate-X++ on universal and widely applicable animation images. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the superiority and effectiveness of Animate-X++.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新型输入感知后门攻击方法IAG，针对视觉语言模型（VLMs）的视觉定位任务，通过自适应触发器生成器将攻击目标的语义信息嵌入图像，实现攻击目标对象的强制定位。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型在视觉定位任务中表现出色，但其安全性问题，尤其是后门攻击，尚未充分研究。本文旨在探索这一领域。

Method: 提出IAG方法，利用文本条件U-Net生成自适应触发器，嵌入攻击目标的语义信息，并通过重构损失确保攻击的隐蔽性。

Result: IAG在InternVL-2.5-8B上的ASR@0.5超过65%，且在Ferret-7B和LlaVA-1.5-7B上表现出色，对干净样本的准确性影响极小。

Conclusion: IAG是一种高效且隐蔽的后门攻击方法，具有鲁棒性和可迁移性，为VLM安全性研究提供了新视角。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have shown significant advancements in tasks
such as visual grounding, where they localize specific objects in images based
on natural language queries and images. However, security issues in visual
grounding tasks for VLMs remain underexplored, especially in the context of
backdoor attacks. In this paper, we introduce a novel input-aware backdoor
attack method, IAG, designed to manipulate the grounding behavior of VLMs. This
attack forces the model to ground a specific target object in the input image,
regardless of the user's query. We propose an adaptive trigger generator that
embeds the semantic information of the attack target's description into the
original image using a text-conditional U-Net, thereby overcoming the
open-vocabulary attack challenge. To ensure the attack's stealthiness, we
utilize a reconstruction loss to minimize visual discrepancies between poisoned
and clean images. Additionally, we introduce a unified method for generating
attack data. IAG is evaluated theoretically and empirically, demonstrating its
feasibility and effectiveness. Notably, our ASR@0.5 on InternVL-2.5-8B reaches
over 65\% on various testing sets. IAG also shows promising potential on
manipulating Ferret-7B and LlaVA-1.5-7B with very little accuracy decrease on
clean samples. Extensive specific experiments, such as ablation study and
potential defense, also indicate the robustness and transferability of our
attack.

Result: 在多个基准测试中达到最先进的定位性能，为可扩展和模态无关的VML设定了新基准。

Conclusion: RelayFormer通过高效的设计和泛化能力，为视觉篡改定位提供了强大的解决方案。

Abstract: Visual manipulation localization (VML) -- across both images and videos -- is
a crucial task in digital forensics that involves identifying tampered regions
in visual content. However, existing methods often lack cross-modal
generalization and struggle to handle high-resolution or long-duration inputs
efficiently.
  We propose RelayFormer, a unified and modular architecture for visual
manipulation localization across images and videos. By leveraging flexible
local units and a Global-Local Relay Attention (GLoRA) mechanism, it enables
scalable, resolution-agnostic processing with strong generalization. Our
framework integrates seamlessly with existing Transformer-based backbones, such
as ViT and SegFormer, via lightweight adaptation modules that require only
minimal architectural changes, ensuring compatibility without disrupting
pretrained representations.
  Furthermore, we design a lightweight, query-based mask decoder that supports
one-shot inference across video sequences with linear complexity. Extensive
experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that our approach achieves
state-of-the-art localization performance, setting a new baseline for scalable
and modality-agnostic VML. Code is available at:

Abstract: Different forms of customized 2D avatars are widely used in gaming
applications, virtual communication, education, and content creation. However,
existing approaches often fail to capture fine-grained facial expressions and
struggle to preserve identity across different expressions. We propose
GEN-AFFECT, a novel framework for personalized avatar generation that generates
expressive and identity-consistent avatars with a diverse set of facial
expressions. Our framework proposes conditioning a multimodal diffusion
transformer on an extracted identity-expression representation. This enables
identity preservation and representation of a wide range of facial expressions.
GEN-AFFECT additionally employs consistent attention at inference for
information sharing across the set of generated expressions, enabling the
generation process to maintain identity consistency over the array of generated
fine-grained expressions. GEN-AFFECT demonstrates superior performance compared
to previous state-of-the-art methods on the basis of the accuracy of the
generated expressions, the preservation of the identity and the consistency of
the target identity across an array of fine-grained facial expressions.

Abstract: Robust fitting of geometric models is a fundamental task in many computer
vision pipelines. Numerous innovations have been produced on the topic, from
improving the efficiency and accuracy of random sampling heuristics to
generating novel theoretical insights that underpin new approaches with
mathematical guarantees. However, one aspect of robust fitting that has
received little attention is energy efficiency. This performance metric has
become critical as high energy consumption is a growing concern for AI
adoption. In this paper, we explore energy-efficient robust fitting via the
neuromorphic computing paradigm. Specifically, we designed a novel spiking
neural network for robust fitting on real neuromorphic hardware, the Intel
Loihi 2. Enabling this are novel event-driven formulations of model estimation
that allow robust fitting to be implemented in the unique architecture of Loihi
2, and algorithmic strategies to alleviate the current limited precision and
instruction set of the hardware. Results show that our neuromorphic robust
fitting consumes only a fraction (15%) of the energy required to run the
established robust fitting algorithm on a standard CPU to equivalent accuracy.

Conclusion: CitySeg通过创新方法显著提升了城市规模点云语义分割的性能和泛化能力。

Abstract: Semantic segmentation of city-scale point clouds is a critical technology for
Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) perception systems, enabling the classification
of 3D points without relying on any visual information to achieve comprehensive
3D understanding. However, existing models are frequently constrained by the
limited scale of 3D data and the domain gap between datasets, which lead to
reduced generalization capability. To address these challenges, we propose
CitySeg, a foundation model for city-scale point cloud semantic segmentation
that incorporates text modality to achieve open vocabulary segmentation and
zero-shot inference. Specifically, in order to mitigate the issue of
non-uniform data distribution across multiple domains, we customize the data
preprocessing rules, and propose a local-global cross-attention network to
enhance the perception capabilities of point networks in UAV scenarios. To
resolve semantic label discrepancies across datasets, we introduce a
hierarchical classification strategy. A hierarchical graph established
according to the data annotation rules consolidates the data labels, and the
graph encoder is used to model the hierarchical relationships between
categories. In addition, we propose a two-stage training strategy and employ
hinge loss to increase the feature separability of subcategories. Experimental
results demonstrate that the proposed CitySeg achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA)
performance on nine closed-set benchmarks, significantly outperforming existing
approaches. Moreover, for the first time, CitySeg enables zero-shot
generalization in city-scale point cloud scenarios without relying on visual
information.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度伪造检测方法在未知样本上表现不佳，但现实中这些样本仍可用于分析，因此需要将其视为少样本任务。

Method: 提出FTNet，仅使用一个评估集中的伪造样本，无需训练或参数更新，通过比较测试样本与已知伪造和真实样本的距离进行分类。

Result: 在29种生成模型生成的图像上进行了全面分析，平均性能提升8.7%，达到新的SoTA。

Conclusion: 研究为深度伪造检测提供了新视角：当模型在少样本上泛化能力不足时，利用失败样本可提升性能。

Abstract: Recent deepfake detection studies often treat unseen sample detection as a
``zero-shot" task, training on images generated by known models but
generalizing to unknown ones. A key real-world challenge arises when a model
performs poorly on unknown samples, yet these samples remain available for
analysis. This highlights that it should be approached as a ``few-shot" task,
where effectively utilizing a small number of samples can lead to significant
improvement. Unlike typical few-shot tasks focused on semantic understanding,
deepfake detection prioritizes image realism, which closely mirrors real-world
distributions. In this work, we propose the Few-shot Training-free Network
(FTNet) for real-world few-shot deepfake detection. Simple yet effective, FTNet
differs from traditional methods that rely on large-scale known data for
training. Instead, FTNet uses only one fake samplefrom an evaluation set,
mimicking the scenario where new samples emerge in the real world and can be
gathered for use, without any training or parameter updates. During evaluation,
each test sample is compared to the known fake and real samples, and it is
classified based on the category of the nearest sample. We conduct a
comprehensive analysis of AI-generated images from 29 different generative
models and achieve a new SoTA performance, with an average improvement of 8.7\%
compared to existing methods. This work introduces a fresh perspective on
real-world deepfake detection: when the model struggles to generalize on a
few-shot sample, leveraging the failed samples leads to better performance.

Conclusion: MoFE和LFA数据集有效解决了大角度面部视频生成中的身份保持问题，代码和数据集将公开。

Abstract: Current video generation models struggle with identity preservation under
large facial angles, primarily facing two challenges: the difficulty in
exploring an effective mechanism to integrate identity features into DiT
structure, and the lack of targeted coverage of large facial angles in existing
open-source video datasets. To address these, we present two key innovations.
First, we introduce a Mixture of Facial Experts (MoFE) that dynamically
combines complementary cues from three specialized experts, each designed to
capture distinct but mutually reinforcing aspects of facial attributes. The
identity expert captures cross-pose identity-sensitive features, the semantic
expert extracts high-level visual semantxics, and the detail expert preserves
pixel-level features (e.g., skin texture, color gradients). Furthermore, to
mitigate dataset limitations, we have tailored a data processing pipeline
centered on two key aspects: Face Constraints and Identity Consistency. Face
Constraints ensure facial angle diversity and a high proportion of facial
regions, while Identity Consistency preserves coherent person-specific features
across temporal sequences, collectively addressing the scarcity of large facial
angles and identity-stable training data in existing datasets. Leveraging this
pipeline, we have curated and refined a Large Face Angles (LFA) Dataset from
existing open-source human video datasets, comprising 460K video clips with
annotated facial angles. Experimental results on the LFA benchmark demonstrate
that our method, empowered by the LFA dataset, significantly outperforms prior
SOTA methods in face similarity, face FID, and CLIP semantic alignment. The
code and dataset will be made publicly available at

Result: 实验证明该方法对多种图像生成器生成的AI图像检测有效。

Conclusion: 该方法通过无监督学习实现了对未见生成模型的泛化检测，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of AI generative models, the visual quality of
AI-generated images (AIIs) has become increasingly close to natural images,
which inevitably raises security concerns. Most AII detectors often employ the
conventional image classification pipeline with natural images and AIIs
(generated by a generative model), which can result in limited detection
performance for AIIs from unseen generative models. To solve this, we proposed
a universal AI-generated image detector from the perspective of anomaly
detection. Our discriminator does not need to access any AIIs and learn a
generalizable representation with unsupervised learning. Specifically, we use
the pre-trained CLIP encoder as the feature extractor and design a normalizing
flow-like unsupervised model. Instead of AIIs, proxy images, e.g., obtained by
applying a spectral modification operation on natural images, are used for
training. Our models are trained by minimizing the likelihood of proxy images,
optionally combined with maximizing the likelihood of natural images. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on AIIs produced by
various image generators.

Conclusion: GazeLT通过有效利用放射科医生的视觉注意力动态，显著提升了长尾疾病分类的性能，为自动化图像解读提供了新思路。

Abstract: In this work, we present GazeLT, a human visual attention
integration-disintegration approach for long-tailed disease classification. A
radiologist's eye gaze has distinct patterns that capture both fine-grained and
coarser level disease related information. While interpreting an image, a
radiologist's attention varies throughout the duration; it is critical to
incorporate this into a deep learning framework to improve automated image
interpretation. Another important aspect of visual attention is that apart from
looking at major/obvious disease patterns, experts also look at
minor/incidental findings (few of these constituting long-tailed classes)
during the course of image interpretation. GazeLT harnesses the temporal aspect
of the visual search process, via an integration and disintegration mechanism,
to improve long-tailed disease classification. We show the efficacy of GazeLT
on two publicly available datasets for long-tailed disease classification,
namely the NIH-CXR-LT (n=89237) and the MIMIC-CXR-LT (n=111898) datasets.
GazeLT outperforms the best long-tailed loss by 4.1% and the visual
attention-based baseline by 21.7% in average accuracy metrics for these
datasets. Our code is available at https://github.com/lordmoinak1/gazelt.

*Xuejun Huang,Xinyi Liu,Yi Wan,Zhi Zheng,Bin Zhang,Mingtao Xiong,Yingying Pei,Yongjun Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SkySplat提出了一种自监督框架，将RPC模型融入通用3DGS流程，显著提升了稀疏卫星图像的三维重建效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3DGS方法因与RPC模型不兼容及泛化能力有限，难以适用于稀疏卫星图像。

Method: SkySplat结合RPC模型，利用RGB图像和辐射鲁棒的相对高度监督，通过CSCM模块和多视角一致性聚合策略优化重建。

Result: SkySplat比EOGS快86倍且精度更高，在DFC19数据集上MAE从13.18米降至1.80米，并在MVS3D基准上表现出强泛化能力。

Conclusion: SkySplat为稀疏卫星图像的三维重建提供了高效且通用的解决方案。

Abstract: Three-dimensional scene reconstruction from sparse-view satellite images is a
long-standing and challenging task. While 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) and its
variants have recently attracted attention for its high efficiency, existing
methods remain unsuitable for satellite images due to incompatibility with
rational polynomial coefficient (RPC) models and limited generalization
capability. Recent advances in generalizable 3DGS approaches show potential,
but they perform poorly on multi-temporal sparse satellite images due to
limited geometric constraints, transient objects, and radiometric
inconsistencies. To address these limitations, we propose SkySplat, a novel
self-supervised framework that integrates the RPC model into the generalizable
3DGS pipeline, enabling more effective use of sparse geometric cues for
improved reconstruction. SkySplat relies only on RGB images and
radiometric-robust relative height supervision, thereby eliminating the need
for ground-truth height maps. Key components include a Cross-Self Consistency
Module (CSCM), which mitigates transient object interference via
consistency-based masking, and a multi-view consistency aggregation strategy
that refines reconstruction results. Compared to per-scene optimization
methods, SkySplat achieves an 86 times speedup over EOGS with higher accuracy.
It also outperforms generalizable 3DGS baselines, reducing MAE from 13.18 m to
1.80 m on the DFC19 dataset significantly, and demonstrates strong
cross-dataset generalization on the MVS3D benchmark.

TL;DR: Video-EM框架通过模拟人类情景记忆，解决了Video-LLMs在长视频理解中的关键帧冗余和时空关系缺失问题，显著提升了性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在处理长视频时忽略了时空关系，导致关键帧冗余和信息丢失，影响了视频问答的准确性。

Method: Video-EM将关键帧建模为时序性情景事件，结合链式思维（CoT）迭代筛选最小但信息丰富的记忆子集。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，Video-EM性能提升4-9%，同时使用更少的关键帧。

Conclusion: Video-EM通过情景记忆建模和CoT思维，显著提升了长视频理解的效率和准确性。

Abstract: Video Large Language Models (Video-LLMs) excel at general video understanding
but struggle with long-form videos due to context window limits. Consequently,
recent approaches focus on keyframe retrieval, condensing lengthy videos into a
small set of informative frames. Despite their practicality, these methods
simplify the problem to static text image matching, overlooking spatio temporal
relationships crucial for capturing scene transitions and contextual
continuity, and may yield redundant keyframes with limited information,
diluting salient cues essential for accurate video question answering. To
address these limitations, we introduce Video-EM, a training free framework
inspired by the principles of human episodic memory, designed to facilitate
robust and contextually grounded reasoning. Rather than treating keyframes as
isolated visual entities, Video-EM explicitly models them as temporally ordered
episodic events, capturing both spatial relationships and temporal dynamics
necessary for accurately reconstructing the underlying narrative. Furthermore,
the framework leverages chain of thought (CoT) thinking with LLMs to
iteratively identify a minimal yet highly informative subset of episodic
memories, enabling efficient and accurate question answering by Video-LLMs.
Extensive evaluations on the Video-MME, EgoSchema, HourVideo, and LVBench
benchmarks confirm the superiority of Video-EM, which achieves highly
competitive results with performance gains of 4-9 percent over respective
baselines while utilizing fewer frames.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种名为SARE的新方法，用于检测扩散模型生成的假图像，通过测量图像与其标题引导重建之间的语义差异，提高了对未见生成模型的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型的快速发展引发了对其滥用的担忧，现有检测方法在面对未见生成模型时性能下降，因为它们依赖模型特定的伪影。

Method: 提出SARE（语义感知重建误差），通过量化图像与标题引导重建之间的语义差异，作为判别特征。

Result: 实验表明，SARE在GenImage和CommunityForensics等基准测试中表现优于现有基线，具有强泛化能力。

Conclusion: SARE通过捕捉假图像与标题的高相似性，提供了一种鲁棒的检测方法，适用于多样化的生成模型。

Abstract: Recently, diffusion-generated image detection has gained increasing
attention, as the rapid advancement of diffusion models has raised serious
concerns about their potential misuse. While existing detection methods have
achieved promising results, their performance often degrades significantly when
facing fake images from unseen, out-of-distribution (OOD) generative models,
since they primarily rely on model-specific artifacts. To address this
limitation, we explore a fundamental property commonly observed in fake images.
Motivated by the observation that fake images tend to exhibit higher similarity
to their captions than real images, we propose a novel representation, namely
Semantic-Aware Reconstruction Error (SARE), that measures the semantic
difference between an image and its caption-guided reconstruction. The
hypothesis behind SARE is that real images, whose captions often fail to fully
capture their complex visual content, may undergo noticeable semantic shifts
during the caption-guided reconstruction process. In contrast, fake images,
which closely align with their captions, show minimal semantic changes. By
quantifying these semantic shifts, SARE can be utilized as a discriminative
feature for robust detection across diverse generative models. We empirically
demonstrate that the proposed method exhibits strong generalization,
outperforming existing baselines on benchmarks including GenImage and
CommunityForensics.

TL;DR: CWFBind是一种基于局部曲率特征的快速、准确的分子对接方法，通过结合几何信息提升预测精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习方法依赖图和语言模型编码器，忽略了关键几何信息，导致口袋定位和结合构象不准确。

Method: CWFBind整合局部曲率描述符，增强蛋白质和配体的几何表示，并引入度感知权重机制和动态半径策略。

Result: CWFBind在多个对接基准测试中表现优异，平衡了精度与效率。

Conclusion: CWFBind通过几何特征和动态策略显著提升了分子对接的准确性。

Abstract: Accurately predicting the binding conformation of small-molecule ligands to
protein targets is a critical step in rational drug design. Although recent
deep learning-based docking surpasses traditional methods in speed and
accuracy, many approaches rely on graph representations and language
model-inspired encoders while neglecting critical geometric information,
resulting in inaccurate pocket localization and unrealistic binding
conformations. In this study, we introduce CWFBind, a weighted, fast, and
accurate docking method based on local curvature features. Specifically, we
integrate local curvature descriptors during the feature extraction phase to
enrich the geometric representation of both proteins and ligands, complementing
existing chemical, sequence, and structural features. Furthermore, we embed
degree-aware weighting mechanisms into the message passing process, enhancing
the model's ability to capture spatial structural distinctions and interaction
strengths. To address the class imbalance challenge in pocket prediction,
CWFBind employs a ligand-aware dynamic radius strategy alongside an enhanced
loss function, facilitating more precise identification of binding regions and
key residues. Comprehensive experimental evaluations demonstrate that CWFBind
achieves competitive performance across multiple docking benchmarks, offering a
balanced trade-off between accuracy and efficiency.

Motivation: 手语是听力障碍人士的重要交流媒介，但手语生成技术仍需探索。现有模型在分辨率和细节上存在不足，需改进。

Method: 结合Progressive Growing GAN（ProGAN）和Self-Attention GAN（SAGAN），开发了一种改进的基于注意力的模型，用于生成印度手语图像。

Result: 改进模型在Inception Score（IS）和Fr\'echet Inception Distance（FID）上分别提升了3.2和30.12，并发布了包含印度手语字母、数字和129个单词的大规模数据集。

Conclusion: 提出的GAN变体在手语图像生成中表现出色，为听力障碍人士的交流提供了更好的技术支持。

Abstract: Sign language, which contains hand movements, facial expressions and bodily
gestures, is a significant medium for communicating with hard-of-hearing
people. A well-trained sign language community communicates easily, but those
who don't know sign language face significant challenges. Recognition and
generation are basic communication methods between hearing and hard-of-hearing
individuals. Despite progress in recognition, sign language generation still
needs to be explored. The Progressive Growing of Generative Adversarial Network
(ProGAN) excels at producing high-quality images, while the Self-Attention
Generative Adversarial Network (SAGAN) generates feature-rich images at medium
resolutions. Balancing resolution and detail is crucial for sign language image
generation. We are developing a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) variant
that combines both models to generate feature-rich, high-resolution, and
class-conditional sign language images. Our modified Attention-based model
generates high-quality images of Indian Sign Language letters, numbers, and
words, outperforming the traditional ProGAN in Inception Score (IS) and
Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID), with improvements of 3.2 and 30.12,
respectively. Additionally, we are publishing a large dataset incorporating
high-quality images of Indian Sign Language alphabets, numbers, and 129 words.

TL;DR: 论文首次系统研究了单目标跟踪中的相似物体干扰（SOI），通过实验验证消除干扰可显著提升性能，并构建了首个语义认知引导基准SOIBench。现有方法效果有限，而提出的新范式利用大规模视觉语言模型（VLM）实现了显著改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 相似物体干扰（SOI）是单目标跟踪（SOT）中长期被忽视的关键瓶颈，研究旨在量化其影响并探索外部认知引导的可行性。

Method: 通过在线干扰掩蔽（OIM）实验量化SOI影响，构建SOIBench基准，并利用大规模视觉语言模型（VLM）作为外部认知引擎。

Result: 消除干扰源可显著提升跟踪性能（AUC增益达4.35）；现有视觉语言跟踪方法效果有限（AUC变化-0.26至+0.71），而新范式实现显著改进（AUC增益达0.93）。

Conclusion: SOIBench为语义认知跟踪研究提供了标准化平台，新范式展示了外部认知引导的潜力，为跟踪领域带来新见解。

Abstract: In this paper, we present the first systematic investigation and
quantification of Similar Object Interference (SOI), a long-overlooked yet
critical bottleneck in Single Object Tracking (SOT). Through controlled Online
Interference Masking (OIM) experiments, we quantitatively demonstrate that
eliminating interference sources leads to substantial performance improvements
(AUC gains up to 4.35) across all SOTA trackers, directly validating SOI as a
primary constraint for robust tracking and highlighting the feasibility of
external cognitive guidance. Building upon these insights, we adopt natural
language as a practical form of external guidance, and construct SOIBench-the
first semantic cognitive guidance benchmark specifically targeting SOI
challenges. It automatically mines SOI frames through multi-tracker collective
judgment and introduces a multi-level annotation protocol to generate precise
semantic guidance texts. Systematic evaluation on SOIBench reveals a striking
finding: existing vision-language tracking (VLT) methods fail to effectively
exploit semantic cognitive guidance, achieving only marginal improvements or
even performance degradation (AUC changes of -0.26 to +0.71). In contrast, we
propose a novel paradigm employing large-scale vision-language models (VLM) as
external cognitive engines that can be seamlessly integrated into arbitrary RGB
trackers. This approach demonstrates substantial improvements under semantic
cognitive guidance (AUC gains up to 0.93), representing a significant
advancement over existing VLT methods. We hope SOIBench will serve as a
standardized evaluation platform to advance semantic cognitive tracking
research and contribute new insights to the tracking research community.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为SDT的新型视觉Transformer，通过动态数据依赖的空间衰减机制改进了传统ViT在空间结构任务中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统ViT的自注意力机制缺乏显式的空间归纳偏置，导致在空间结构化任务中表现不佳。现有方法使用固定的距离度量引入空间衰减，无法适应多样化的视觉场景。

Method: 提出了SDT，采用Context-Aware Gating（CAG）机制生成动态、数据依赖的空间衰减，结合曼哈顿距离的空间先验和学习到的内容表示。

Result: 在ImageNet-1K分类和生成任务中，SDT表现优于现有基线模型。

Conclusion: 数据依赖的空间衰减机制为增强视觉Transformer的空间注意力提供了新范式。

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) have revolutionized computer vision, yet their
self-attention mechanism lacks explicit spatial inductive biases, leading to
suboptimal performance on spatially-structured tasks. Existing approaches
introduce data-independent spatial decay based on fixed distance metrics,
applying uniform attention weighting regardless of image content and limiting
adaptability to diverse visual scenarios. Inspired by recent advances in large
language models where content-aware gating mechanisms (e.g., GLA, HGRN2, FOX)
significantly outperform static alternatives, we present the first successful
adaptation of data-dependent spatial decay to 2D vision transformers. We
introduce \textbf{Spatial Decay Transformer (SDT)}, featuring a novel
Context-Aware Gating (CAG) mechanism that generates dynamic, data-dependent
decay for patch interactions. Our approach learns to modulate spatial attention
based on both content relevance and spatial proximity. We address the
fundamental challenge of 1D-to-2D adaptation through a unified spatial-content
fusion framework that integrates manhattan distance-based spatial priors with
learned content representations. Extensive experiments on ImageNet-1K
classification and generation tasks demonstrate consistent improvements over
strong baselines. Our work establishes data-dependent spatial decay as a new
paradigm for enhancing spatial attention in vision transformers.

Method: 提出AKCS模型提高测量非相干性，MACA机制学习隐式表示，并集成到展开网络中形成MEUNet。

Result: MEUNet在重建精度和推理速度上达到最优性能。

Conclusion: AKCS和MACA的结合有效解决了现有方法的不足，MEUNet在压缩感知任务中表现卓越。

Abstract: Deep networks have achieved remarkable success in image compressed sensing
(CS) task, namely reconstructing a high-fidelity image from its compressed
measurement. However, existing works are deficient inincoherent compressed
measurement at sensing phase and implicit measurement representations at
reconstruction phase, limiting the overall performance. In this work, we answer
two questions: 1) how to improve the measurement incoherence for decreasing the
ill-posedness; 2) how to learn informative representations from measurements.
To this end, we propose a novel asymmetric Kronecker CS (AKCS) model and
theoretically present its better incoherence than previous Kronecker CS with
minimal complexity increase. Moreover, we reveal that the unfolding networks'
superiority over non-unfolding ones result from sufficient gradient descents,
called explicit measurement representations. We propose a measurement-aware
cross attention (MACA) mechanism to learn implicit measurement representations.
We integrate AKCS and MACA into widely-used unfolding architecture to get a
measurement-enhanced unfolding network (MEUNet). Extensive experiences
demonstrate that our MEUNet achieves state-of-the-art performance in
reconstruction accuracy and inference speed.

Conclusion: COXNet在复杂环境中表现出鲁棒的检测能力，为RGBT微小物体检测提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Detecting tiny objects in multimodal Red-Green-Blue-Thermal (RGBT) imagery is
a critical challenge in computer vision, particularly in surveillance, search
and rescue, and autonomous navigation. Drone-based scenarios exacerbate these
challenges due to spatial misalignment, low-light conditions, occlusion, and
cluttered backgrounds. Current methods struggle to leverage the complementary
information between visible and thermal modalities effectively. We propose
COXNet, a novel framework for RGBT tiny object detection, addressing these
issues through three core innovations: i) the Cross-Layer Fusion Module, fusing
high-level visible and low-level thermal features for enhanced semantic and
spatial accuracy; ii) the Dynamic Alignment and Scale Refinement module,
correcting cross-modal spatial misalignments and preserving multi-scale
features; and iii) an optimized label assignment strategy using the GeoShape
Similarity Measure for better localization. COXNet achieves a 3.32\% mAP$_{50}$
improvement on the RGBTDronePerson dataset over state-of-the-art methods,
demonstrating its effectiveness for robust detection in complex environments.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种针对非对称立体视觉的双阶段迭代体积融合网络（IVF-AStereo），通过结合两种成本体积方法解决视觉不对称问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统立体匹配算法假设双目视觉对称，但非对称多相机系统（如广角-长焦相机）的普及打破了这一假设，导致匹配困难。

Method: 提出IVF-AStereo网络，分两阶段：先通过聚合拼接体积优化相关体积，再融合两种体积以增强细节。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在非对称场景下表现优异，对分辨率和色彩退化具有鲁棒性。

Conclusion: IVF-AStereo有效解决了非对称立体匹配问题，并通过实验验证了其性能。

Abstract: Stereo matching is vital in 3D computer vision, with most algorithms assuming
symmetric visual properties between binocular visions. However, the rise of
asymmetric multi-camera systems (e.g., tele-wide cameras) challenges this
assumption and complicates stereo matching. Visual asymmetry disrupts stereo
matching by affecting the crucial cost volume computation. To address this, we
explore the matching cost distribution of two established cost volume
construction methods in asymmetric stereo. We find that each cost volume
experiences distinct information distortion, indicating that both should be
comprehensively utilized to solve the issue. Based on this, we propose the
two-phase Iterative Volume Fusion network for Asymmetric Stereo matching
(IVF-AStereo). Initially, the aggregated concatenation volume refines the
correlation volume. Subsequently, both volumes are fused to enhance fine
details. Our method excels in asymmetric scenarios and shows robust performance
against significant visual asymmetry. Extensive comparative experiments on
benchmark datasets, along with ablation studies, confirm the effectiveness of
our approach in asymmetric stereo with resolution and color degradation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法依赖结构化输入（如语义标注或环境地图），而GoViG仅利用原始视觉数据，提高对未知和非结构化环境的适应性。

Method: 将任务分解为视觉预测（预测中间视觉状态）和指令生成（基于观察和预测生成连贯指令），通过多模态大语言模型集成。

Result: 在R2R-Goal数据集上表现优于现有方法，BLEU-4和CIDEr分数显著提升，并具有跨域泛化能力。

Conclusion: GoViG通过视觉预测和指令生成的结合，实现了高效且适应性强的导航指令生成。

Abstract: We introduce Goal-Conditioned Visual Navigation Instruction Generation
(GoViG), a new task that aims to autonomously generate precise and contextually
coherent navigation instructions solely from egocentric visual observations of
initial and goal states. Unlike conventional approaches that rely on structured
inputs such as semantic annotations or environmental maps, GoViG exclusively
leverages raw egocentric visual data, substantially improving its adaptability
to unseen and unstructured environments. Our method addresses this task by
decomposing it into two interconnected subtasks: (1) visual forecasting, which
predicts intermediate visual states bridging the initial and goal views; and
(2) instruction generation, which synthesizes linguistically coherent
instructions grounded in both observed and anticipated visuals. These subtasks
are integrated within an autoregressive multimodal large language model trained
with tailored objectives to ensure spatial accuracy and linguistic clarity.
Furthermore, we introduce two complementary multimodal reasoning strategies,
one-pass and interleaved reasoning, to mimic incremental human cognitive
processes during navigation. To evaluate our method, we propose the R2R-Goal
dataset, combining diverse synthetic and real-world trajectories. Empirical
results demonstrate significant improvements over state-of-the-art methods,
achieving superior BLEU-4 and CIDEr scores along with robust cross-domain
generalization.

Abstract: In this paper, we address a key scientific problem in machine learning: Given
a training set for an image classification task, can we train a generative
model on this dataset to enhance the classification performance? (i.e.,
closed-set generative data augmentation). We start by exploring the
distinctions and similarities between real images and closed-set synthetic
images generated by advanced generative models. Through extensive experiments,
we offer systematic insights into the effective use of closed-set synthetic
data for augmentation. Notably, we empirically determine the equivalent scale
of synthetic images needed for augmentation. In addition, we also show
quantitative equivalence between the real data augmentation and open-set
generative augmentation (generative models trained using data beyond the given
training set). While it aligns with the common intuition that real images are
generally preferred, our empirical formulation also offers a guideline to
quantify the increased scale of synthetic data augmentation required to achieve
comparable image classification performance. Our results on natural and medical
image datasets further illustrate how this effect varies with the baseline
training set size and the amount of synthetic data incorporated.

Abstract: Objective - This study presents a biometric identification method based on
topological invariants from 2D iris images, representing iris texture via
formally defined digital homology and evaluating classification performance.
  Methods - Each normalized iris image (48x482 pixels) is divided into grids
(e.g., 6x54 or 3x27). For each subregion, we compute Betti0, Betti1, and their
ratio using a recent algorithm for homology groups in 2D digital images. The
resulting invariants form a feature matrix used with logistic regression, KNN,
and SVM (with PCA and 100 randomized repetitions). A convolutional neural
network (CNN) is trained on raw images for comparison.
  Results - Logistic regression achieved 97.78 +/- 0.82% accuracy,
outperforming CNN (96.44 +/- 1.32%) and other feature-based models. The
topological features showed high accuracy with low variance.
  Conclusion - This is the first use of topological invariants from formal
digital homology for iris recognition. The method offers a compact,
interpretable, and accurate alternative to deep learning, useful when
explainability or limited data is important. Beyond iris recognition, it can
apply to other biometrics, medical imaging, materials science, remote sensing,
and interpretable AI. It runs efficiently on CPU-only systems and produces
robust, explainable features valuable for security-critical domains.

Abstract: Visual geo-localization for drones faces critical degradation under weather
perturbations, \eg, rain and fog, where existing methods struggle with two
inherent limitations: 1) Heavy reliance on limited weather categories that
constrain generalization, and 2) Suboptimal disentanglement of entangled
scene-weather features through pseudo weather categories. We present
WeatherPrompt, a multi-modality learning paradigm that establishes
weather-invariant representations through fusing the image embedding with the
text context. Our framework introduces two key contributions: First, a
Training-free Weather Reasoning mechanism that employs off-the-shelf large
multi-modality models to synthesize multi-weather textual descriptions through
human-like reasoning. It improves the scalability to unseen or complex weather,
and could reflect different weather strength. Second, to better disentangle the
scene and weather feature, we propose a multi-modality framework with the
dynamic gating mechanism driven by the text embedding to adaptively reweight
and fuse visual features across modalities. The framework is further optimized
by the cross-modal objectives, including image-text contrastive learning and
image-text matching, which maps the same scene with different weather
conditions closer in the respresentation space. Extensive experiments validate
that, under diverse weather conditions, our method achieves competitive recall
rates compared to state-of-the-art drone geo-localization methods. Notably, it
improves Recall@1 by +13.37\% under night conditions and by 18.69\% under fog
and snow conditions.

Abstract: Multi-exposure correction technology is essential for restoring images
affected by insufficient or excessive lighting, enhancing the visual experience
by improving brightness, contrast, and detail richness. However, current
multi-exposure correction methods often encounter challenges in addressing
intra-class variability caused by diverse lighting conditions, shooting
environments, and weather factors, particularly when processing images captured
at a single exposure level. To enhance the adaptability of these models under
complex imaging conditions, this paper proposes a Wavelet-based Exposure
Correction method with Degradation Guidance (WEC-DG). Specifically, we
introduce a degradation descriptor within the Exposure Consistency Alignment
Module (ECAM) at both ends of the processing pipeline to ensure exposure
consistency and achieve final alignment. This mechanism effectively addresses
miscorrected exposure anomalies caused by existing methods' failure to
recognize 'blurred' exposure degradation. Additionally, we investigate the
light-detail decoupling properties of the wavelet transform to design the
Exposure Restoration and Detail Reconstruction Module (EDRM), which processes
low-frequency information related to exposure enhancement before utilizing
high-frequency information as a prior guide for reconstructing spatial domain
details. This serial processing strategy guarantees precise light correction
and enhances detail recovery. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple
public datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing
algorithms, achieving significant performance improvements and validating its
effectiveness and practical applicability.

Motivation: 现有放射学报告生成方法在临床效果和可解释性上表现不佳，尤其是对病灶属性的描述和结果的信任度不足。

Method: 提出CoD框架，通过诊断对话生成问答对提取关键发现，利用大型语言模型生成报告，并设计诊断和病灶定位模块增强可解释性。采用全监督学习策略利用多源标注数据。

Conclusion: CoD框架显著提升了放射学报告生成的临床准确性和可解释性，为放射科医生提供了高效且可信的工具。

Abstract: Despite the progress of radiology report generation (RRG), existing works
face two challenges: 1) The performances in clinical efficacy are
unsatisfactory, especially for lesion attributes description; 2) the generated
text lacks explainability, making it difficult for radiologists to trust the
results. To address the challenges, we focus on a trustworthy RRG model, which
not only generates accurate descriptions of abnormalities, but also provides
basis of its predictions. To this end, we propose a framework named chain of
diagnosis (CoD), which maintains a chain of diagnostic process for clinically
accurate and explainable RRG. It first generates question-answer (QA) pairs via
diagnostic conversation to extract key findings, then prompts a large language
model with QA diagnoses for accurate generation. To enhance explainability, a
diagnosis grounding module is designed to match QA diagnoses and generated
sentences, where the diagnoses act as a reference. Moreover, a lesion grounding
module is designed to locate abnormalities in the image, further improving the
working efficiency of radiologists. To facilitate label-efficient training, we
propose an omni-supervised learning strategy with clinical consistency to
leverage various types of annotations from different datasets. Our efforts lead
to 1) an omni-labeled RRG dataset with QA pairs and lesion boxes; 2) a
evaluation tool for assessing the accuracy of reports in describing lesion
location and severity; 3) extensive experiments to demonstrate the
effectiveness of CoD, where it outperforms both specialist and generalist
models consistently on two RRG benchmarks and shows promising explainability by
accurately grounding generated sentences to QA diagnoses and images.

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需训练的双递归反馈（DRF）系统，用于改进可控文本到图像（T2I）扩散模型的空间和外观控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有可控T2I模型在保留空间结构和捕捉细粒度条件（如物体姿态和场景布局）方面表现不佳。

Method: 通过外观反馈和生成反馈的双递归机制，优化中间潜在表示以更好地反映外观信息和用户意图。

Result: 实验表明，DRF能生成高质量、语义一致且结构一致的图像，支持跨类别的结构-外观融合。

Conclusion: DRF是一种有效的训练免费方法，显著提升了可控T2I模型的性能。

Abstract: Recent advancements in controllable text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models,
such as Ctrl-X and FreeControl, have demonstrated robust spatial and appearance
control without requiring auxiliary module training. However, these models
often struggle to accurately preserve spatial structures and fail to capture
fine-grained conditions related to object poses and scene layouts. To address
these challenges, we propose a training-free Dual Recursive Feedback (DRF)
system that properly reflects control conditions in controllable T2I models.
The proposed DRF consists of appearance feedback and generation feedback that
recursively refines the intermediate latents to better reflect the given
appearance information and the user's intent. This dual-update mechanism guides
latent representations toward reliable manifolds, effectively integrating
structural and appearance attributes. Our approach enables fine-grained
generation even between class-invariant structure-appearance fusion, such as
transferring human motion onto a tiger's form. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the efficacy of our method in producing high-quality, semantically
coherent, and structurally consistent image generations. Our source code is
available at https://github.com/jwonkm/DRF.

Motivation: 大视觉语言模型（LVLMs）存在幻觉问题，现有评估方法在细粒度分析和数据可扩展性方面不足。

Method: 提出自动化数据构建管道和分层幻觉诱导框架，构建SHALE基准，包含30K图像-指令对，覆盖12个视觉感知方面和6个知识领域。

Result: 实验表明主流LVLMs存在显著的事实性幻觉，并对语义扰动高度敏感。

Conclusion: SHALE基准为LVLMs的幻觉问题提供了可扩展且细粒度的评估工具。

Abstract: Despite rapid advances, Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) still suffer
from hallucinations, i.e., generating content inconsistent with input or
established world knowledge, which correspond to faithfulness and factuality
hallucinations, respectively. Prior studies primarily evaluate faithfulness
hallucination at a coarse level (e.g., object-level) and lack fine-grained
analysis. Additionally, existing benchmarks rely on costly manual curation or
reused public datasets, raising concerns about scalability and data leakage. To
address these limitations, we propose an automated data construction pipeline
that produces scalable, controllable, and diverse evaluation data. We also
design a hierarchical hallucination induction framework with input
perturbations to simulate realistic noisy scenarios. Integrating these designs,
we construct SHALE, a Scalable HALlucination Evaluation benchmark designed to
assess both faithfulness and factuality hallucinations via a fine-grained
hallucination categorization scheme. SHALE comprises over 30K image-instruction
pairs spanning 12 representative visual perception aspects for faithfulness and
6 knowledge domains for factuality, considering both clean and noisy scenarios.
Extensive experiments on over 20 mainstream LVLMs reveal significant factuality
hallucinations and high sensitivity to semantic perturbations.

along with shape estimation to provide annotation labels on the detection level
under various supervision levels. Simultaneously, the framework provides
evaluation of tracking performance and label annotation. If manually labeled
data is available, each processing module can be analyzed independently or

framework performance is evaluated in a challenging urban real-world scenario

Motivation: 当前基于功能MRI的IDH突变预测方法受限于数据可用性和噪声问题，而结构和形态连接组提供了一种非侵入性替代方案。现有方法常忽略大脑的层次结构和多尺度交互。

Method: 提出Hi-SMGNN框架，整合区域到模块级别的结构和形态连接组，包括多模态交互模块（Siamese网络和跨模态注意力）、多尺度特征融合机制和个性化模块分区策略。

Conclusion: Hi-SMGNN通过分层和多尺度设计，显著提升了IDH突变预测的性能和可解释性。

Abstract: Isocitrate DeHydrogenase (IDH) mutation status is a crucial biomarker for
glioma prognosis. However, current prediction methods are limited by the low
availability and noise of functional MRI. Structural and morphological
connectomes offer a non-invasive alternative, yet existing approaches often
ignore the brain's hierarchical organisation and multiscale interactions. To
address this, we propose Hi-SMGNN, a hierarchical framework that integrates
structural and morphological connectomes from regional to modular levels. It
features a multimodal interaction module with a Siamese network and cross-modal
attention, a multiscale feature fusion mechanism for reducing redundancy, and a
personalised modular partitioning strategy to enhance individual specificity
and interpretability. Experiments on the UCSF-PDGM dataset demonstrate that
Hi-SMGNN outperforms baseline and state-of-the-art models, showing improved
robustness and effectiveness in IDH mutation prediction.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决头像建模中几何与全局外观纠缠的问题，提升AR/VR应用中实时编辑的灵活性。

Method: 使用表面高斯和体积高斯分别建模外观和非朗伯区域，结合FLAME网格的UV映射实现纹理编辑。

Result: 在NeRSemble数据集上实现了高保真渲染，并首次支持高斯头像的实时外观编辑。

Conclusion: SVG-Head在重建质量和编辑灵活性上均表现优异，为头像建模提供了新思路。

Abstract: Creating high-fidelity and editable head avatars is a pivotal challenge in
computer vision and graphics, boosting many AR/VR applications. While recent
advancements have achieved photorealistic renderings and plausible animation,
head editing, especially real-time appearance editing, remains challenging due
to the implicit representation and entangled modeling of the geometry and
global appearance. To address this, we propose Surface-Volumetric Gaussian Head
Avatar (SVG-Head), a novel hybrid representation that explicitly models the
geometry with 3D Gaussians bound on a FLAME mesh and leverages disentangled
texture images to capture the global appearance. Technically, it contains two
types of Gaussians, in which surface Gaussians explicitly model the appearance
of head avatars using learnable texture images, facilitating real-time texture
editing, while volumetric Gaussians enhance the reconstruction quality of
non-Lambertian regions (e.g., lips and hair). To model the correspondence
between 3D world and texture space, we provide a mesh-aware Gaussian UV mapping
method, which leverages UV coordinates given by the FLAME mesh to obtain sharp
texture images and real-time rendering speed. A hierarchical optimization
strategy is further designed to pursue the optimal performance in both
reconstruction quality and editing flexibility. Experiments on the NeRSemble
dataset show that SVG-Head not only generates high-fidelity rendering results,
but also is the first method to obtain explicit texture images for Gaussian
head avatars and support real-time appearance editing.

TL;DR: 论文提出FaME方法，通过评估图像质量并利用失败样本作为负引导，提升扩散模型的生成质量，同时保持FID分数不变。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散模型在类到图像生成中虽FID分数高，但某些类别图像质量差，因FID忽略单样本感知质量。CFG技术虽提升指标但引入分布偏移和视觉伪影。

Method: FaME利用图像质量评估模型识别低质量生成，存储其采样轨迹作为负引导，避免未来采样进入低质量区域。

Result: 在ImageNet上，FaME显著提升视觉质量且不影响FID，并有望扩展至文本到图像生成。

Conclusion: FaME是一种无需训练、推理高效的方法，能有效提升扩散模型的生成质量。

Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable progress in class-to-image
generation. However, we observe that despite impressive FID scores,
state-of-the-art models often generate distorted or low-quality images,
especially in certain classes. This gap arises because FID evaluates global
distribution alignment, while ignoring the perceptual quality of individual
samples. We further examine the role of CFG, a common technique used to enhance
generation quality. While effective in improving metrics and suppressing
outliers, CFG can introduce distribution shift and visual artifacts due to its
misalignment with both training objectives and user expectations. In this work,
we propose FaME, a training-free and inference-efficient method for improving
perceptual quality. FaME uses an image quality assessment model to identify
low-quality generations and stores their sampling trajectories. These failure
modes are then used as negative guidance to steer future sampling away from
poor-quality regions. Experiments on ImageNet demonstrate that FaME brings
consistent improvements in visual quality without compromising FID. FaME also
shows the potential to be extended to improve text-to-image generation.

TL;DR: 提出BridgeTA框架，通过教师助理网络缩小LiDAR-Camera融合与纯相机模型之间的表示差距，保持学生模型架构和推理成本不变。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 纯相机方法在自动驾驶BEV分割任务中表现不如LiDAR-Camera融合方法，现有知识蒸馏方法通过模仿教师架构增加学生模型复杂度，导致推理成本上升。

Method: 引入轻量级教师助理网络，结合教师和学生的BEV表示，创建共享潜在空间，并通过Young不等式推导蒸馏损失，分解为教师-TA和TA-学生双路径。

Result: 在nuScenes数据集上，mIoU提升4.2%，优于其他最先进蒸馏方法45%。

Conclusion: BridgeTA框架有效缩小了纯相机与融合方法的性能差距，且不增加推理成本。

Abstract: Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) map segmentation is one of the most important and
challenging tasks in autonomous driving. Camera-only approaches have drawn
attention as cost-effective alternatives to LiDAR, but they still fall behind
LiDAR-Camera (LC) fusion-based methods. Knowledge Distillation (KD) has been
explored to narrow this gap, but existing methods mainly enlarge the student
model by mimicking the teacher's architecture, leading to higher inference
cost. To address this issue, we introduce BridgeTA, a cost-effective
distillation framework to bridge the representation gap between LC fusion and
Camera-only models through a Teacher Assistant (TA) network while keeping the
student's architecture and inference cost unchanged. A lightweight TA network
combines the BEV representations of the teacher and student, creating a shared
latent space that serves as an intermediate representation. To ground the
framework theoretically, we derive a distillation loss using Young's
Inequality, which decomposes the direct teacher-student distillation path into
teacher-TA and TA-student dual paths, stabilizing optimization and
strengthening knowledge transfer. Extensive experiments on the challenging
nuScenes dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of our method, achieving an
improvement of 4.2% mIoU over the Camera-only baseline, up to 45% higher than
the improvement of other state-of-the-art KD methods.

Method: 将InDI概念从2D扩展到3D，通过迭代去噪过程直接从稀疏视图输入中优化CBCT体积，并使用大型伪CBCT数据集进行训练。

Result: 在CT-RATE测试集上，PSNR增益为12.96 dB，辐射暴露减少8倍，性能与3D U-Net相当，并能适应新的CBCT扫描仪几何结构。

Conclusion: MInDI-3D在临床评估中表现优异，适用于患者定位并保留了肿瘤边界。

Abstract: We present MInDI-3D (Medical Inversion by Direct Iteration in 3D), the first
3D conditional diffusion-based model for real-world sparse-view Cone Beam
Computed Tomography (CBCT) artefact removal, aiming to reduce imaging radiation
exposure. A key contribution is extending the "InDI" concept from 2D to a full
3D volumetric approach for medical images, implementing an iterative denoising
process that refines the CBCT volume directly from sparse-view input. A further
contribution is the generation of a large pseudo-CBCT dataset (16,182) from
chest CT volumes of the CT-RATE public dataset to robustly train MInDI-3D. We
performed a comprehensive evaluation, including quantitative metrics,
scalability analysis, generalisation tests, and a clinical assessment by 11
clinicians. Our results show MInDI-3D's effectiveness, achieving a 12.96 (6.10)
dB PSNR gain over uncorrected scans with only 50 projections on the CT-RATE
pseudo-CBCT (independent real-world) test set and enabling an 8x reduction in
imaging radiation exposure. We demonstrate its scalability by showing that
performance improves with more training data. Importantly, MInDI-3D matches the
performance of a 3D U-Net on real-world scans from 16 cancer patients across
distortion and task-based metrics. It also generalises to new CBCT scanner
geometries. Clinicians rated our model as sufficient for patient positioning
across all anatomical sites and found it preserved lung tumour boundaries well.

Result: 实验表明，该方法比Open3D RANSAC更准确，且通过神经网络分割加速了算法。

Conclusion: 提出的信息优化框架能有效减少误检，提升平面检测的准确性，适用于复杂场景。

Abstract: Plane detection from depth images is a crucial subtask with broad robotic
applications, often accomplished by iterative methods such as Random Sample
Consensus (RANSAC). While RANSAC is a robust strategy with strong probabilistic
guarantees, the ambiguity of its inlier threshold criterion makes it
susceptible to false positive plane detections. This issue is particularly
prevalent in complex real-world scenes, where the true number of planes is
unknown and multiple planes coexist. In this paper, we aim to address this
limitation by proposing a generalised framework for plane detection based on
model information optimization. Building on previous works, we treat the
observed depth readings as discrete random variables, with their probability
distributions constrained by the ground truth planes. Various models containing
different candidate plane constraints are then generated through repeated
random sub-sampling to explain our observations. By incorporating the physics
and noise model of the depth sensor, we can calculate the information for each
model, and the model with the least information is accepted as the most likely
ground truth. This information optimization process serves as an objective
mechanism for determining the true number of planes and preventing false
positive detections. Additionally, the quality of each detected plane can be
ranked by summing the information reduction of inlier points for each plane. We
validate these properties through experiments with synthetic data and find that
our algorithm estimates plane parameters more accurately compared to the
default Open3D RANSAC plane segmentation. Furthermore, we accelerate our
algorithm by partitioning the depth map using neural network segmentation,
which enhances its ability to generate more realistic plane parameters in
real-world data.

Result: 实验表明，SAD-Splat在分割精度和表示紧凑性之间取得了优异平衡，并提出了新的基准数据集3D-AS。

Conclusion: SAD-Splat为3D航空场景理解提供了高效且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: In the task of 3D Aerial-view Scene Semantic Segmentation (3D-AVS-SS),
traditional methods struggle to address semantic ambiguity caused by scale
variations and structural occlusions in aerial images. This limits their
segmentation accuracy and consistency. To tackle these challenges, we propose a
novel 3D-AVS-SS approach named SAD-Splat. Our method introduces a Gaussian
point drop module, which integrates semantic confidence estimation with a
learnable sparsity mechanism based on the Hard Concrete distribution. This
module effectively eliminates redundant and semantically ambiguous Gaussian
points, enhancing both segmentation performance and representation compactness.
Furthermore, SAD-Splat incorporates a high-confidence pseudo-label generation
pipeline. It leverages 2D foundation models to enhance supervision when
ground-truth labels are limited, thereby further improving segmentation
accuracy. To advance research in this domain, we introduce a challenging
benchmark dataset: 3D Aerial Semantic (3D-AS), which encompasses diverse
real-world aerial scenes with sparse annotations. Experimental results
demonstrate that SAD-Splat achieves an excellent balance between segmentation
accuracy and representation compactness. It offers an efficient and scalable
solution for 3D aerial scene understanding.

Motivation: 现有高性能模型在手部几何与图像外观的对齐上存在不足，纹理对齐可能是一个未被充分利用的监督信号。

Method: 提出一个轻量级纹理模块，将像素观测嵌入UV纹理空间，并引入密集对齐损失，结合可微分渲染和已知拓扑的3D手部网格模型。

Result: 通过增强HaMeR模型，系统在精度和真实感上均有提升。

Conclusion: 纹理引导的监督在手部重建中具有重要价值。

Abstract: We revisit the role of texture in monocular 3D hand reconstruction, not as an
afterthought for photorealism, but as a dense, spatially grounded cue that can
actively support pose and shape estimation. Our observation is simple: even in
high-performing models, the overlay between predicted hand geometry and image
appearance is often imperfect, suggesting that texture alignment may be an
underused supervisory signal. We propose a lightweight texture module that
embeds per-pixel observations into UV texture space and enables a novel dense
alignment loss between predicted and observed hand appearances. Our approach
assumes access to a differentiable rendering pipeline and a model that maps
images to 3D hand meshes with known topology, allowing us to back-project a
textured hand onto the image and perform pixel-based alignment. The module is
self-contained and easily pluggable into existing reconstruction pipelines. To
isolate and highlight the value of texture-guided supervision, we augment
HaMeR, a high-performing yet unadorned transformer architecture for 3D hand
pose estimation. The resulting system improves both accuracy and realism,
demonstrating the value of appearance-guided alignment in hand reconstruction.

Preacher, the first paper-to-video agentic system. Preacher employs a top-down
approach to decompose, summarize, and reformulate the paper, followed by
bottom-up video generation, synthesizing diverse video segments into a coherent
abstract. To align cross-modal representations, we define key scenes and
introduce a Progressive Chain of Thought (P-CoT) for granular, iterative

five research fields, demonstrating expertise beyond current video generation
models. Code will be released at: https://github.com/GenVerse/Paper2Video

Abstract: Purpose: Prenatal ultrasound is a key tool in evaluating fetal structural
development and detecting abnormalities, contributing to reduced perinatal
complications and improved neonatal survival. Accurate identification of
standard fetal torso planes is essential for reliable assessment and
personalized prenatal care. However, limitations such as low contrast and
unclear texture details in ultrasound imaging pose significant challenges for
fine-grained anatomical recognition. Methods: We propose a novel Multi-Contrast
Fusion Module (MCFM) to enhance the model's ability to extract detailed
information from ultrasound images. MCFM operates exclusively on the lower
layers of the neural network, directly processing raw ultrasound data. By
assigning attention weights to image representations under different contrast
conditions, the module enhances feature modeling while explicitly maintaining
minimal parameter overhead. Results: The proposed MCFM was evaluated on a
curated dataset of fetal torso plane ultrasound images. Experimental results
demonstrate that MCFM substantially improves recognition performance, with a
minimal increase in model complexity. The integration of multi-contrast
attention enables the model to better capture subtle anatomical structures,
contributing to higher classification accuracy and clinical reliability.
Conclusions: Our method provides an effective solution for improving fetal
torso plane recognition in ultrasound imaging. By enhancing feature
representation through multi-contrast fusion, the proposed approach supports
clinicians in achieving more accurate and consistent diagnoses, demonstrating
strong potential for clinical adoption in prenatal screening. The codes are

Motivation: 现有方法依赖精确的病变提示且忽略专家知识，PG-SAM旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 通过专家诊断报告生成提示模块和跨序列注意力模块，结合多模态信息进行分割。

Result: PG-SAM在三个独立临床中心实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: PG-SAM验证了专家文本在临床图像分割中的有效性。

Abstract: Parotid gland lesion segmentation is essential for the treatment of parotid
gland diseases. However, due to the variable size and complex lesion
boundaries, accurate parotid gland lesion segmentation remains challenging.
Recently, the Segment Anything Model (SAM) fine-tuning has shown remarkable
performance in the field of medical image segmentation. Nevertheless, SAM's
interaction segmentation model relies heavily on precise lesion prompts
(points, boxes, masks, etc.), which are very difficult to obtain in real-world
applications. Besides, current medical image segmentation methods are
automatically generated, ignoring the domain knowledge of medical experts when
performing segmentation. To address these limitations, we propose the parotid
gland segment anything model (PG-SAM), an expert diagnosis text-guided SAM
incorporating expert domain knowledge for cross-sequence parotid gland lesion
segmentation. Specifically, we first propose an expert diagnosis report guided
prompt generation module that can automatically generate prompt information
containing the prior domain knowledge to guide the subsequent lesion
segmentation process. Then, we introduce a cross-sequence attention module,
which integrates the complementary information of different modalities to
enhance the segmentation effect. Finally, the multi-sequence image features and
generated prompts are feed into the decoder to get segmentation result.
Experimental results demonstrate that PG-SAM achieves state-of-the-art
performance in parotid gland lesion segmentation across three independent
clinical centers, validating its clinical applicability and the effectiveness
of diagnostic text for enhancing image segmentation in real-world clinical
settings.

Conclusion: ReMIND2Reg挑战赛为临床关键且技术复杂的问题建立了标准化评估框架，促进鲁棒、通用且临床可部署的多模态配准算法发展。

Abstract: Accurate intraoperative image guidance is critical for achieving maximal safe
resection in brain tumor surgery, yet neuronavigation systems based on
preoperative MRI lose accuracy during the procedure due to brain shift.
Aligning post-resection intraoperative ultrasound (iUS) with preoperative MRI
can restore spatial accuracy by estimating brain shift deformations, but it
remains a challenging problem given the large anatomical and topological
changes and substantial modality intensity gap. The ReMIND2Reg 2025 Challenge
provides the largest public benchmark for this task, built upon the ReMIND
dataset. It offers 99 training cases, 5 validation cases, and 10 private test
cases comprising paired 3D ceT1 MRI, T2 MRI, and post-resection 3D iUS volumes.
Data are provided without annotations for training, while validation and test
performance are evaluated on manually annotated anatomical landmarks. Metrics
include target registration error (TRE), robustness to worst-case landmark
misalignment (TRE30), and runtime. By establishing a standardized evaluation
framework for this clinically critical and technically complex problem,
ReMIND2Reg aims to accelerate the development of robust, generalizable, and
clinically deployable multimodal registration algorithms for image-guided
neurosurgery.

Motivation: 非视距（NLOS）成像中，间接光信号弱且易受噪声干扰，需物理过程支持以确保准确重建。

Method: 采用噪声估计模块和参数化神经算子，通过深度算法展开实现端到端快速重建，并融合全局与局部时空数据特征。

Result: 在模拟和真实数据集上的实验表明，该方法在快速扫描和稀疏照明点数据下表现优异。

Conclusion: 该方法为复杂场景下的NLOS成像提供了可行解决方案，兼具高准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Computational imaging, especially non-line-of-sight (NLOS) imaging, the
extraction of information from obscured or hidden scenes is achieved through
the utilization of indirect light signals resulting from multiple reflections
or scattering. The inherently weak nature of these signals, coupled with their
susceptibility to noise, necessitates the integration of physical processes to
ensure accurate reconstruction. This paper presents a parameterized inverse
problem framework tailored for large-scale linear problems in 3D imaging
reconstruction. Initially, a noise estimation module is employed to adaptively
assess the noise levels present in transient data. Subsequently, a
parameterized neural operator is developed to approximate the inverse mapping,
facilitating end-to-end rapid image reconstruction. Our 3D image reconstruction
framework, grounded in operator learning, is constructed through deep algorithm
unfolding, which not only provides commendable model interpretability but also
enables dynamic adaptation to varying noise levels in the acquired data,
thereby ensuring consistently robust and accurate reconstruction outcomes.
Furthermore, we introduce a novel method for the fusion of global and local
spatiotemporal data features. By integrating structural and detailed
information, this method significantly enhances both accuracy and robustness.
Comprehensive numerical experiments conducted on both simulated and real
datasets substantiate the efficacy of the proposed method. It demonstrates
remarkable performance with fast scanning data and sparse illumination point
data, offering a viable solution for NLOS imaging in complex scenarios.

Motivation: 解决现有身份条件扩散模型在生成数据时缺乏明确的类间分离机制，导致身份重叠和次优人脸识别性能的问题。

Method: 提出NegFaceDiff方法，在身份条件扩散过程中加入负条件，明确引导模型远离不需要的特征，同时保持类内一致性。

Result: 实验表明，NegFaceDiff将身份可分性（FDR）从2.427提高到5.687，并在多个基准测试中优于未使用负条件生成的模型。

Conclusion: NegFaceDiff通过负条件采样显著提升了生成数据的质量和人脸识别模型的性能。

Abstract: The use of synthetic data as an alternative to authentic datasets in face
recognition (FR) development has gained significant attention, addressing
privacy, ethical, and practical concerns associated with collecting and using
authentic data. Recent state-of-the-art approaches have proposed
identity-conditioned diffusion models to generate identity-consistent face
images, facilitating their use in training FR models. However, these methods
often lack explicit sampling mechanisms to enforce inter-class separability,
leading to identity overlap in the generated data and, consequently, suboptimal
FR performance. In this work, we introduce NegFaceDiff, a novel sampling method
that incorporates negative conditions into the identity-conditioned diffusion
process. NegFaceDiff enhances identity separation by leveraging negative
conditions that explicitly guide the model away from unwanted features while
preserving intra-class consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
NegFaceDiff significantly improves the identity consistency and separability of
data generated by identity-conditioned diffusion models. Specifically, identity
separability, measured by the Fisher Discriminant Ratio (FDR), increases from
2.427 to 5.687. These improvements are reflected in FR systems trained on the
NegFaceDiff dataset, which outperform models trained on data generated without
negative conditions across multiple benchmarks.

Motivation: 稀疏视图3DGS重建因信息不足导致明显伪影，现有生成先验方法难以保持与输入观测的一致性。

Method: 基于DiT的视频扩散模型，结合2D语义和3D几何特征，增强修复视图的语义一致性和3D一致性。

Result: GSFixer在3DGS伪影修复和稀疏视图3D重建中优于现有方法。

Conclusion: GSFixer通过多特征融合和参考引导，显著提升了稀疏视图3DGS重建的质量。

Abstract: Reconstructing 3D scenes using 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) from sparse views
is an ill-posed problem due to insufficient information, often resulting in
noticeable artifacts. While recent approaches have sought to leverage
generative priors to complete information for under-constrained regions, they
struggle to generate content that remains consistent with input observations.
To address this challenge, we propose GSFixer, a novel framework designed to
improve the quality of 3DGS representations reconstructed from sparse inputs.
The core of our approach is the reference-guided video restoration model, built
upon a DiT-based video diffusion model trained on paired artifact 3DGS renders
and clean frames with additional reference-based conditions. Considering the
input sparse views as references, our model integrates both 2D semantic
features and 3D geometric features of reference views extracted from the visual
geometry foundation model, enhancing the semantic coherence and 3D consistency
when fixing artifact novel views. Furthermore, considering the lack of suitable
benchmarks for 3DGS artifact restoration evaluation, we present DL3DV-Res which
contains artifact frames rendered using low-quality 3DGS. Extensive experiments
demonstrate our GSFixer outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in 3DGS
artifact restoration and sparse-view 3D reconstruction. Project page:

Motivation: 现有方法在点跟踪中难以实现一致的运动或仅限于2D运动，因此需要一种更优的解决方案。

Method: 使用可逆神经辐射场（InvNeRF）架构参数化函数，结合多尺度HexPlanes和高效像素采样算法，实现2D和3D跟踪。

Result: 在STIR和SCARE数据集上，2D跟踪精度提升50%，3D跟踪首次实现TTO方法并优于前馈方法。

Conclusion: 该方法在2D和3D点跟踪中均表现出色，结合了可变形NeRF的优势，为长期跟踪提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: We proposed a novel test-time optimisation (TTO) approach framed by a
NeRF-based architecture for long-term 3D point tracking. Most current methods
in point tracking struggle to obtain consistent motion or are limited to 2D
motion. TTO approaches frame the solution for long-term tracking as optimising
a function that aggregates correspondences from other specialised
state-of-the-art methods. Unlike the state-of-the-art on TTO, we propose
parametrising such a function with our new invertible Neural Radiance Field
(InvNeRF) architecture to perform both 2D and 3D tracking in surgical
scenarios. Our approach allows us to exploit the advantages of a
rendering-based approach by supervising the reprojection of pixel
correspondences. It adapts strategies from recent rendering-based methods to
obtain a bidirectional deformable-canonical mapping, to efficiently handle a
defined workspace, and to guide the rays' density. It also presents our
multi-scale HexPlanes for fast inference and a new algorithm for efficient
pixel sampling and convergence criteria. We present results in the STIR and
SCARE datasets, for evaluating point tracking and testing the integration of
kinematic data in our pipeline, respectively. In 2D point tracking, our
approach surpasses the precision and accuracy of the TTO state-of-the-art
methods by nearly 50% on average precision, while competing with other
approaches. In 3D point tracking, this is the first TTO approach, surpassing
feed-forward methods while incorporating the benefits of a deformable
NeRF-based reconstruction.

Conclusion: 该方法推动了面部表示学习，提供了一种高效、可扩展的解决方案，减少对昂贵标注数据的依赖。

Abstract: Facial representation pre-training is crucial for tasks like facial
recognition, expression analysis, and virtual reality. However, existing
methods face three key challenges: (1) failing to capture distinct facial
features and fine-grained semantics, (2) ignoring the spatial structure
inherent to facial anatomy, and (3) inefficiently utilizing limited labeled
data. To overcome these, we introduce PaCo-FR, an unsupervised framework that
combines masked image modeling with patch-pixel alignment. Our approach
integrates three innovative components: (1) a structured masking strategy that
preserves spatial coherence by aligning with semantically meaningful facial
regions, (2) a novel patch-based codebook that enhances feature discrimination
with multiple candidate tokens, and (3) spatial consistency constraints that
preserve geometric relationships between facial components. PaCo-FR achieves
state-of-the-art performance across several facial analysis tasks with just 2
million unlabeled images for pre-training. Our method demonstrates significant
improvements, particularly in scenarios with varying poses, occlusions, and
lighting conditions. We believe this work advances facial representation
learning and offers a scalable, efficient solution that reduces reliance on
expensive annotated datasets, driving more effective facial analysis systems.

Conclusion: SAFF通过Slot Attention有效过滤无关特征，提升了小样本学习的分类性能。

Abstract: Irrelevant features can significantly degrade few-shot learn ing performance.
This problem is used to match queries and support images based on meaningful
similarities despite the limited data. However, in this process, non-relevant
fea tures such as background elements can easily lead to confu sion and
misclassification. To address this issue, we pro pose Slot Attention-based
Feature Filtering for Few-Shot Learning (SAFF) that leverages slot attention
mechanisms to discriminate and filter weak features, thereby improving few-shot
classification performance. The key innovation of SAFF lies in its integration
of slot attention with patch em beddings, unifying class-aware slots into a
single attention mechanism to filter irrelevant features effectively. We intro
duce a similarity matrix that computes across support and query images to
quantify the relevance of filtered embed dings for classification. Through
experiments, we demon strate that Slot Attention performs better than other
atten tion mechanisms, capturing discriminative features while reducing
irrelevant information. We validate our approach through extensive experiments
on few-shot learning bench marks: CIFAR-FS, FC100, miniImageNet and tieredIma

Result: 在两个基准数据集上显著优于现有方法，定性和定量评估均表现优异。

Conclusion: MangaDiT通过内部注意力机制有效提升了参考引导线稿着色的区域级颜色一致性。

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have significantly improved the
performance of reference-guided line art colorization. However, existing
methods still struggle with region-level color consistency, especially when the
reference and target images differ in character pose or motion. Instead of
relying on external matching annotations between the reference and target, we
propose to discover semantic correspondences implicitly through internal
attention mechanisms. In this paper, we present MangaDiT, a powerful model for
reference-guided line art colorization based on Diffusion Transformers (DiT).
Our model takes both line art and reference images as conditional inputs and
introduces a hierarchical attention mechanism with a dynamic attention
weighting strategy. This mechanism augments the vanilla attention with an
additional context-aware path that leverages pooled spatial features,
effectively expanding the model's receptive field and enhancing region-level
color alignment. Experiments on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that our
method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, achieving
superior performance in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations.

Conclusion: NEURAL在数据大小和临床实用性之间取得了平衡，支持高效工作流程和远程放射学。

Abstract: The rapid growth of multimodal medical imaging data presents significant
storage and transmission challenges, particularly in resource-constrained
clinical settings. We propose NEURAL, a novel framework that addresses this by
using semantics-guided data compression. Our approach repurposes
cross-attention scores between the image and its radiological report from a
fine-tuned generative vision-language model to structurally prune chest X-rays,
preserving only diagnostically critical regions. This process transforms the
image into a highly compressed, graph representation. This unified graph-based
representation fuses the pruned visual graph with a knowledge graph derived
from the clinical report, creating a universal data structure that simplifies
downstream modeling. Validated on the MIMIC-CXR and CheXpert Plus dataset for
pneumonia detection, NEURAL achieves a 93.4-97.7\% reduction in image data size
while maintaining a high diagnostic performance of 0.88-0.95 AUC, outperforming
other baseline models that use uncompressed data. By creating a persistent,
task-agnostic data asset, NEURAL resolves the trade-off between data size and
clinical utility, enabling efficient workflows and teleradiology without
sacrificing performance. Our NEURAL code is available at

Abstract: Glioblastoma is a highly invasive brain tumor with rapid progression rates.
Recent studies have shown that glioblastoma molecular subtype classification
serves as a significant biomarker for effective targeted therapy selection.
However, this classification currently requires invasive tissue extraction for
comprehensive histopathological analysis. Existing multimodal approaches
combining MRI and histopathology images are limited and lack robust mechanisms
for preserving shared structural information across modalities. In particular,
graph-based models often fail to retain discriminative features within
heterogeneous graphs, and structural reconstruction mechanisms for handling
missing or incomplete modality data are largely underexplored. To address these
limitations, we propose a novel sheaf-based framework for structure-aware and
consistent fusion of MRI and histopathology data. Our model outperforms
baseline methods and demonstrates robustness in incomplete or missing data
scenarios, contributing to the development of virtual biopsy tools for rapid
diagnostics. Our source code is available at

Abstract: Recent advances in data-driven computer vision have enabled robust autonomous

safety requirements for aviation applications remains a major challenge. In
this work, we present a practical vision-based pipeline for aircraft pose
estimation from runway images that represents a step toward the ability to
certify these systems for use in safety-critical aviation applications. Our
approach features three key innovations: (i) an efficient, flexible neural
architecture based on a spatial Soft Argmax operator for probabilistic keypoint
regression, supporting diverse vision backbones with real-time inference; (ii)
a principled loss function producing calibrated predictive uncertainties, which
are evaluated via sharpness and calibration metrics; and (iii) an adaptation of
Residual-based Receiver Autonomous Integrity Monitoring (RAIM), enabling
runtime detection and rejection of faulty model outputs. We implement and
evaluate our pose estimation pipeline on a dataset of runway images. We show
that our model outperforms baseline architectures in terms of accuracy while
also producing well-calibrated uncertainty estimates with sub-pixel precision
that can be used downstream for fault detection.

Abstract: We introduce M3-Agent, a novel multimodal agent framework equipped with
long-term memory. Like humans, M3-Agent can process real-time visual and

Given an instruction, M3-Agent autonomously performs multi-turn, iterative
reasoning and retrieves relevant information from memory to accomplish the
task. To evaluate memory effectiveness and memory-based reasoning in multimodal
agents, we develop M3-Bench, a new long-video question answering benchmark.
M3-Bench comprises 100 newly recorded real-world videos captured from a robot's
perspective (M3-Bench-robot) and 929 web-sourced videos across diverse
scenarios (M3-Bench-web). We annotate question-answer pairs designed to test
key capabilities essential for agent applications, such as human understanding,
general knowledge extraction, and cross-modal reasoning. Experimental results
show that M3-Agent, trained via reinforcement learning, outperforms the
strongest baseline, a prompting agent using Gemini-1.5-pro and GPT-4o,
achieving 6.7%, 7.7%, and 5.3% higher accuracy on M3-Bench-robot, M3-Bench-web
and VideoMME-long, respectively. Our work advances the multimodal agents toward
more human-like long-term memory and provides insights into their practical
design. Model, code and data are available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LDM的图像协调方法在细节保留和协调能力上存在不足，且合成数据集缺乏真实光照变化。

Method: 提出R2R模型，结合Clear-VAE和MACA模块，并设计Random Poisson Blending生成多样化合成数据。

Conclusion: R2R方法显著提升了图像协调效果，新数据集为未来研究提供了更真实的训练资源。

Abstract: The goal of image harmonization is to adjust the foreground in a composite
image to achieve visual consistency with the background. Recently, latent
diffusion model (LDM) are applied for harmonization, achieving remarkable
results. However, LDM-based harmonization faces challenges in detail
preservation and limited harmonization ability. Additionally, current synthetic
datasets rely on color transfer, which lacks local variations and fails to
capture complex real-world lighting conditions. To enhance harmonization
capabilities, we propose the Region-to-Region transformation. By injecting
information from appropriate regions into the foreground, this approach
preserves original details while achieving image harmonization or, conversely,
generating new composite data. From this perspective, We propose a novel model
R2R. Specifically, we design Clear-VAE to preserve high-frequency details in
the foreground using Adaptive Filter while eliminating disharmonious elements.
To further enhance harmonization, we introduce the Harmony Controller with
Mask-aware Adaptive Channel Attention (MACA), which dynamically adjusts the
foreground based on the channel importance of both foreground and background
regions. To address the limitation of existing datasets, we propose Random
Poisson Blending, which transfers color and lighting information from a
suitable region to the foreground, thereby generating more diverse and
challenging synthetic images. Using this method, we construct a new synthetic
dataset, RPHarmony. Experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method over
other methods in both quantitative metrics and visual harmony. Moreover, our
dataset helps the model generate more realistic images in real examples. Our
code, dataset, and model weights have all been released for open access.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法依赖表面形状对齐，而新方法明确建模互锁形状的两个特性：相同表面形状和相反体积占用。

Method: 通过学习建立表面形状相同但体积占用相反区域的对应关系，并通过等变神经网络估计形状方向以对齐旋转区域。

Result: 显著减少匹配中的局部模糊性，实现稳健的部件组合，在几何装配基准测试中表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 新方法在几何形状装配中表现出高效性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: This paper introduces a new shape-matching methodology, combinative matching,
to combine interlocking parts for geometric shape assembly. Previous methods
for geometric assembly typically rely on aligning parts by finding identical
surfaces between the parts as in conventional shape matching and registration.
In contrast, we explicitly model two distinct properties of interlocking
shapes: 'identical surface shape' and 'opposite volume occupancy.' Our method
thus learns to establish correspondences across regions where their surface
shapes appear identical but their volumes occupy the inverted space to each
other. To facilitate this process, we also learn to align regions in rotation
by estimating their shape orientations via equivariant neural networks. The
proposed approach significantly reduces local ambiguities in matching and
allows a robust combination of parts in assembly. Experimental results on
geometric assembly benchmarks demonstrate the efficacy of our method,
consistently outperforming the state of the art. Project page:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大型视觉语言模型在多模态任务中表现优异，但其计算成本高昂，稀疏混合专家架构（MoE）虽能提升参数效率，但在同时建模模态内特征和跨模态关联方面仍具挑战性。

Method: 提出MoIIE架构，通过模态引导的路由机制将令牌分配到模态内专家和共享的跨模态专家池中，并采用两阶段训练策略激活MoE和多模态能力。

Result: 实验表明，MoIIE模型在5.5B和11.3B激活参数下，性能匹配甚至超越现有开源MoE-LLMs多模态模型，且计算效率更高。

Conclusion: MoIIE架构在提升大型视觉语言模型效率和性能方面具有显著优势，为多模态任务提供了一种有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance
across multi-modal tasks by scaling model size and training data. However,
these dense LVLMs incur significant computational costs and motivate the
exploration of sparse Mixture of Experts (MoE) architectures. While MoE improve
parameter efficiency, effectively applying MoE to simultaneously model
modality-specific features and cross-modal associations in LVLMs remains
challenging. In this work, we propose to incorporate Mixture of Intra- and
Inter-Modality Experts (MoIIE) to LVLMs. For each token, expert routing is
guided by its modality, directing tokens to their respective intra-modality
experts as well as a shared pool of inter-modality experts, enabling the model
to jointly learn rich intra-modal features and cross-modal interactions. We
further introduce an effective and straightforward two-stage training strategy,
which facilitates the direct activation of both MoE and multi-modal
capabilities. Extensive experiments across different data scales and LLM
backbone demonstrate the effectiveness, efficiency and generality of our
approach. Notably, our MoIIE models with 5.5B and 11.3B activated parameters
match or even surpass the performance of existing advanced open-source MoE-LLMs
based multi-modal models that involve more activated parameters. The code is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统脑组织照片分割需要昂贵的人工干预，限制了大规模分析的可能性。

Method: 使用U-Net架构，结合1,414张手动标注图像和2,000张合成图像进行训练，以提高泛化能力。

Result: 模型在未见过的照片上表现优异，Dice分数中位数超过0.98，接近人工标注的变异性水平。

Conclusion: 该工具公开可用，为脑组织分析提供了高效、自动化的解决方案。

Abstract: Advances in image registration and machine learning have recently enabled
volumetric analysis of \emph{postmortem} brain tissue from conventional
photographs of coronal slabs, which are routinely collected in brain banks and
neuropathology laboratories worldwide. One caveat of this methodology is the
requirement of segmentation of the tissue from photographs, which currently
requires costly manual intervention. In this article, we present a deep
learning model to automate this process. The automatic segmentation tool relies
on a U-Net architecture that was trained with a combination of
\textit{(i)}1,414 manually segmented images of both fixed and fresh tissue,
from specimens with varying diagnoses, photographed at two different sites; and
\textit{(ii)}~2,000 synthetic images with randomized contrast and corresponding
masks generated from MRI scans for improved generalizability to unseen
photographic setups. Automated model predictions on a subset of photographs not
seen in training were analyzed to estimate performance compared to manual
labels -- including both inter- and intra-rater variability. Our model achieved
a median Dice score over 0.98, mean surface distance under 0.4~mm, and 95\%
Hausdorff distance under 1.60~mm, which approaches inter-/intra-rater levels.

Motivation: 探索如何利用大规模预训练模型在少样本类增量学习任务中实现更好的性能，同时避免灾难性遗忘。

Method: 使用静态提示弥合预训练与下游任务的领域差距，动态提示捕获实例感知语义，并结合多模态模型生成输入相关的动态提示。

Result: 在四个基准测试中，DSS-Prompt表现优于现有方法，有效缓解了灾难性遗忘问题。

Conclusion: DSS-Prompt通过结合静态和动态提示，在少样本类增量学习中取得了显著效果，且无需进一步训练。

Abstract: Learning from large-scale pre-trained models with strong generalization
ability has shown remarkable success in a wide range of downstream tasks
recently, but it is still underexplored in the challenging few-shot
class-incremental learning (FSCIL) task. It aims to continually learn new
concepts from limited training samples without forgetting the old ones at the
same time. In this paper, we introduce DSS-Prompt, a simple yet effective
approach that transforms the pre-trained Vision Transformer with minimal
modifications in the way of prompts into a strong FSCIL classifier. Concretely,
we synergistically utilize two complementary types of prompts in each
Transformer block: static prompts to bridge the domain gap between the
pre-training and downstream datasets, thus enabling better adaption; and
dynamic prompts to capture instance-aware semantics, thus enabling easy
transfer from base to novel classes. Specially, to generate dynamic prompts, we
leverage a pre-trained multi-modal model to extract input-related diverse
semantics, thereby generating complementary input-aware prompts, and then
adaptively adjust their importance across different layers. In this way, on top
of the prompted visual embeddings, a simple prototype classifier can beat
state-of-the-arts without further training on the incremental tasks. We conduct
extensive experiments on four benchmarks to validate the effectiveness of our
DSS-Prompt and show that it consistently achieves better performance than
existing approaches on all datasets and can alleviate the catastrophic
forgetting issue as well.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法依赖物理模型或标签，难以学习复杂运动物理。TRACE旨在无需标签的情况下建模3D场景的几何、外观和物理信息。

Method: 将每个3D点视为具有大小和方向的刚性粒子，直接学习其平移旋转动力学系统，并估计物理参数。

Result: 在多个动态数据集上表现优异，未来帧外推任务优于基线方法，并能通过物理参数聚类实现对象分割。

Conclusion: TRACE框架无需标签即可建模复杂动态3D场景的物理运动，且性能优越。

Abstract: In this paper, we aim to model 3D scene geometry, appearance, and physical
information just from dynamic multi-view videos in the absence of any human
labels. By leveraging physics-informed losses as soft constraints or
integrating simple physics models into neural nets, existing works often fail
to learn complex motion physics, or doing so requires additional labels such as
object types or masks. We propose a new framework named TRACE to model the
motion physics of complex dynamic 3D scenes. The key novelty of our method is
that, by formulating each 3D point as a rigid particle with size and
orientation in space, we directly learn a translation rotation dynamics system
for each particle, explicitly estimating a complete set of physical parameters
to govern the particle's motion over time. Extensive experiments on three
existing dynamic datasets and one newly created challenging synthetic datasets
demonstrate the extraordinary performance of our method over baselines in the
task of future frame extrapolation. A nice property of our framework is that
multiple objects or parts can be easily segmented just by clustering the
learned physical parameters.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统跟踪方法依赖卡尔曼滤波和固定IoU匹配，在复杂运动和遮挡下表现不佳。

Method: 提出MeKF（记忆辅助卡尔曼滤波）和Mo-IoU（运动自适应IoU），分别优化运动模型和匹配策略。

Result: 在DanceTrack和SportsMOT数据集上，HOTA分数分别达到67.9%和82.1%。

Conclusion: MeMoSORT在复杂场景下表现优异，且保持轻量化和实时性。

Abstract: Multi-object tracking (MOT) in human-dominant scenarios, which involves
continuously tracking multiple people within video sequences, remains a
significant challenge in computer vision due to targets' complex motion and
severe occlusions. Conventional tracking-by-detection methods are fundamentally
limited by their reliance on Kalman filter (KF) and rigid Intersection over
Union (IoU)-based association. The motion model in KF often mismatches
real-world object dynamics, causing filtering errors, while rigid association
struggles under occlusions, leading to identity switches or target loss. To
address these issues, we propose MeMoSORT, a simple, online, and real-time MOT
tracker with two key innovations. First, the Memory-assisted Kalman filter
(MeKF) uses memory-augmented neural networks to compensate for mismatches
between assumed and actual object motion. Second, the Motion-adaptive IoU
(Mo-IoU) adaptively expands the matching space and incorporates height
similarity to reduce the influence of detection errors and association
failures, while remaining lightweight. Experiments on DanceTrack and SportsMOT
show that MeMoSORT achieves state-of-the-art performance, with HOTA scores of
67.9\% and 82.1\%, respectively.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有单图像超分辨率方法在PBR材料超分辨率中存在跨图不一致、模态特征建模不足和数据分布偏移导致的泛化能力有限等问题。

Method: MUJICA是一种灵活的适配器，基于预训练的Swin-transformer SISR模型，通过跨图注意力机制融合特征，同时保留预训练模型的优秀重建能力。

Result: 实验表明，MUJICA在PSNR、SSIM和LPIPS指标上表现优异，同时保持了跨图一致性，并在有限资源下实现了高效训练。

Conclusion: MUJICA在PBR材料超分辨率任务中实现了最先进的性能，并展示了其高效性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Physically Based Rendering (PBR) materials are typically characterized by
multiple 2D texture maps such as basecolor, normal, metallic, and roughness
which encode spatially-varying bi-directional reflectance distribution function
(SVBRDF) parameters to model surface reflectance properties and microfacet
interactions. Upscaling SVBRDF material is valuable for modern 3D graphics
applications. However, existing Single Image Super-Resolution (SISR) methods
struggle with cross-map inconsistency, inadequate modeling of modality-specific
features, and limited generalization due to data distribution shifts. In this
work, we propose Multi-modal Upscaling Joint Inference via Cross-map Attention
(MUJICA), a flexible adapter that reforms pre-trained Swin-transformer-based
SISR models for PBR material super-resolution. MUJICA is seamlessly attached
after the pre-trained and frozen SISR backbone. It leverages cross-map
attention to fuse features while preserving remarkable reconstruction ability
of the pre-trained SISR model. Applied to SISR models such as SwinIR, DRCT, and
HMANet, MUJICA improves PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS scores while preserving cross-map
consistency. Experiments demonstrate that MUJICA enables efficient training
even with limited resources and delivers state-of-the-art performance on PBR
material datasets.

Abstract: In this paper, we present a generalizable method for 3D surface
reconstruction from raw point clouds or pre-estimated 3D Gaussians by 3DGS from
RGB images. Unlike existing coordinate-based methods which are often
computationally intensive when rendering explicit surfaces, our proposed
method, named RayletDF, introduces a new technique called raylet distance
field, which aims to directly predict surface points from query rays. Our
pipeline consists of three key modules: a raylet feature extractor, a raylet
distance field predictor, and a multi-raylet blender. These components work
together to extract fine-grained local geometric features, predict raylet
distances, and aggregate multiple predictions to reconstruct precise surface
points. We extensively evaluate our method on multiple public real-world
datasets, demonstrating superior performance in surface reconstruction from
point clouds or 3D Gaussians. Most notably, our method achieves exceptional
generalization ability, successfully recovering 3D surfaces in a single-forward
pass across unseen datasets in testing.

Abstract: Elephant Poaching in African countries has been a decade-old problem. So much
so that African Forest Elephants are now listed as an endangered species, and
African Savannah Elephants as critically endangered by the IUCN (International
Union for Conservation of Nature). [1] Elephants are hunted primarily for their
ivory tusks which caused many elephants to be born tuskless as a genetic
modification for survival. [2] Data gathered by recent studies shows that
though poaching methods remain the same, the poaching grounds are rather
dynamic. Poachers have shifted to areas with less ranger patrols and several
other factors like watering holes, seasons, altitude etc. cause constant shifts
in poaching hotspot locations. [3] After a period of low poaching from
2000-2014, poaching numbers in African countries are now on the rise again --
WWF (World Wildlife Foundation) says there are 20,000 elephants poached
annually [4]. In African countries, anti-poaching efforts are concentrated near
towns, while a majority of poaching occurs in the deserted regions. All of
these factors result in the need for a Computer Vision Model to identify
poaching hotspots through locating the geographic indicators of favorable
poaching regions. A CV model eliminates the need to manually track poachers and
account for the environmental factors to deploy resources and its combination
with satellite imagery allows us to survey large areas without disturbing local
species or cross border aviation restrictions.

Motivation: 传统单数据集训练在新数据分布下表现不佳，尤其是在超声图像分析中，因数据有限、声影和斑点噪声等问题。构建一个通用的多异构数据集框架是必要的。

Conclusion: COME通过跨数据集经验分布和通用超声先验，实现了对小批量或未见数据的鲁棒泛化，为超声图像分析提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Conventional single-dataset training often fails with new data distributions,
especially in ultrasound (US) image analysis due to limited data, acoustic
shadows, and speckle noise. Therefore, constructing a universal framework for
multi-heterogeneous US datasets is imperative. However, a key challenge arises:
how to effectively mitigate inter-dataset interference while preserving
dataset-specific discriminative features for robust downstream task? Previous
approaches utilize either a single source-specific decoder or a domain
adaptation strategy, but these methods experienced a decline in performance
when applied to other domains. Considering this, we propose a Universal
Collaborative Mixture of Heterogeneous Source-Specific Experts (COME).
Specifically, COME establishes dual structure-semantic shared experts that
create a universal representation space and then collaborate with
source-specific experts to extract discriminative features through providing
complementary features. This design enables robust generalization by leveraging
cross-datasets experience distributions and providing universal US priors for
small-batch or unseen data scenarios. Extensive experiments under three
evaluation modes (single-dataset, intra-organ, and inter-organ integration
datasets) demonstrate COME's superiority, achieving significant mean AP
improvements over state-of-the-art methods. Our project is available at:

Conclusion: 研究揭示了CLIP学习机制中的权衡，为优化视觉语言模型的感知对齐和鲁棒性提供新见解。

Abstract: During the training of multi-modal models like CLIP, we observed an
intriguing phenomenon: the correlation with low-level human image quality
assessments peaks in the early epochs before gradually declining. This study
investigates this observation and seeks to understand its causes through two
key factors: shape-texture bias alignment and classification accuracy drop
under noise. Our findings suggest that CLIP initially learn low-level visual
features, enhancing its alignment with low-level human perception but also
increasing its sensitivity to noise and its texture bias. As training
progresses, the model shifts toward more abstract shape-based representations,
improving noise robustness but reducing alignment with low-level human
perception. These results suggest that these factors shared an underlying
learning mechanism and provide new insights into optimizing the trade-off
between perceptual alignment and robustness in vision-language models.

Conclusion: 结合视频和运动数据的ViMoNet能更全面地理解和表征人类行为。

Abstract: This study investigates how large language models (LLMs) can be used to
understand human behavior using motion and video data. We think that mixing
both types is essential to completely capture the nuanced movements and
meanings of human actions, in contrast to recent models that simply concentrate
on motion data or films. To address this, we provide ViMoNet, a straightforward
yet effective framework for comprehending, characterizing, and deducing human
action. ViMoNet employs a joint training strategy that leverages the advantages
of two data types: detailed motion-text data, which is more exact, and generic
video-text data, which is more comprehensive but less detailed. This aids in
the model's acquisition of rich data regarding time and space in human
behavior. Additionally, we provide a brand new dataset named VIMOS that
contains a variety of films, motion sequences, instructions, and subtitles. We
developed ViMoNet-Bench, a standardized benchmark with carefully labeled
samples, to evaluate how well models understand human behavior. Our tests show
that ViMoNet outperforms existing methods in caption generation, motion
understanding, and behavior interpretation.

Result: 在ManiSkill基准测试中，PAR在PushCube任务上达到100%成功率，其他任务表现与动作预训练基线相当，并能准确预测未来视频。

Conclusion: PAR展示了通过视频预训练传递世界知识在机器人操作中的潜力。

Abstract: The scarcity of manipulation data has motivated the use of pretrained large
models from other modalities in robotics. In this work, we build upon
autoregressive video generation models to propose a Physical Autoregressive
Model (PAR), where physical tokens combine frames and actions to represent the
joint evolution of the robot and its environment. PAR leverages the world
knowledge embedded in video pretraining to understand physical dynamics without
requiring action pretraining, enabling accurate video prediction and consistent
action trajectories. It also adopts a DiT-based de-tokenizer to model frames
and actions as continuous tokens, mitigating quantization errors and
facilitating mutual enhancement. Furthermore, we incorporate a causal mask with
inverse kinematics, parallel training, and the KV-cache mechanism to further
improve performance and efficiency. Experiments on the ManiSkill benchmark show
that PAR achieves a 100\% success rate on the PushCube task, matches the
performance of action-pretrained baselines on other tasks, and accurately
predicts future videos with tightly aligned action trajectories. These findings
underscore a promising direction for robotic manipulation by transferring world
knowledge from autoregressive video pretraining.

Abstract: Progress in AI for automated nutritional analysis is critically hampered by
the lack of standardized evaluation methodologies and high-quality, real-world
benchmark datasets. To address this, we introduce three primary contributions.
First, we present the January Food Benchmark (JFB), a publicly available
collection of 1,000 food images with human-validated annotations. Second, we
detail a comprehensive benchmarking framework, including robust metrics and a
novel, application-oriented overall score designed to assess model performance
holistically. Third, we provide baseline results from both general-purpose
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and our own specialized model,
january/food-vision-v1. Our evaluation demonstrates that the specialized model
achieves an Overall Score of 86.2, a 12.1-point improvement over the
best-performing general-purpose configuration. This work offers the research
community a valuable new evaluation dataset and a rigorous framework to guide
and benchmark future developments in automated nutritional analysis.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种新颖的深度反向卷积算子，用于有效反转深度卷积，并通过实验验证了其作为基础模块的有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的转置卷积并非卷积的真正逆运算，缺乏标准的反向卷积算子，因此需要开发一种新的反向卷积方法。

Method: 通过正则化最小二乘优化问题设计和实现深度反向卷积算子，并结合层归一化、1×1卷积和GELU激活构建反向卷积块。

Result: 实验表明，提出的反向卷积算子能有效替代传统卷积和转置卷积层，在图像恢复任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: 该研究为深度学习模型设计中的新算子开发提供了可能，并展示了其应用潜力。

Abstract: Convolution and transposed convolution are fundamental operators widely used
in neural networks. However, transposed convolution (a.k.a. deconvolution) does
not serve as a true inverse of convolution due to inherent differences in their
mathematical formulations. To date, no reverse convolution operator has been
established as a standard component in neural architectures. In this paper, we
propose a novel depthwise reverse convolution operator as an initial attempt to
effectively reverse depthwise convolution by formulating and solving a
regularized least-squares optimization problem. We thoroughly investigate its
kernel initialization, padding strategies, and other critical aspects to ensure
its effective implementation. Building upon this operator, we further construct
a reverse convolution block by combining it with layer normalization,
1$\times$1 convolution, and GELU activation, forming a Transformer-like
structure. The proposed operator and block can directly replace conventional
convolution and transposed convolution layers in existing architectures,
leading to the development of ConverseNet. Corresponding to typical image
restoration models such as DnCNN, SRResNet and USRNet, we train three variants
of ConverseNet for Gaussian denoising, super-resolution and deblurring,
respectively. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed reverse convolution operator as a basic building module. We hope this
work could pave the way for developing new operators in deep model design and
applications.

TL;DR: 论文探讨了GPT-4o生成的合成图像数据在弥补真实数据不足和提供干净监督方面的优势，并提出了Echo-4o-Image数据集和两个新评测基准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究动机在于解决真实图像数据在罕见场景和文本-图像对齐上的局限性，探索合成数据的潜在价值。

Method: 通过GPT-4o生成180K规模的合成数据集Echo-4o-Image，并基于此微调多模态生成模型Bagel。同时提出GenEval++和Imagine-Bench两个新评测基准。

Result: Echo-4o在标准评测中表现优异，且合成数据集对其他基础模型（如OmniGen2、BLIP3-o）也有显著性能提升。

Conclusion: 合成数据能有效弥补真实数据的不足，提升模型性能，尤其在罕见场景和文本-图像对齐方面具有独特优势。

Abstract: Recently, GPT-4o has garnered significant attention for its strong
performance in image generation, yet open-source models still lag behind.
Several studies have explored distilling image data from GPT-4o to enhance
open-source models, achieving notable progress. However, a key question
remains: given that real-world image datasets already constitute a natural
source of high-quality data, why should we use GPT-4o-generated synthetic data?
In this work, we identify two key advantages of synthetic images. First, they
can complement rare scenarios in real-world datasets, such as surreal fantasy
or multi-reference image generation, which frequently occur in user queries.
Second, they provide clean and controllable supervision. Real-world data often
contains complex background noise and inherent misalignment between text
descriptions and image content, whereas synthetic images offer pure backgrounds
and long-tailed supervision signals, facilitating more accurate text-to-image
alignment. Building on these insights, we introduce Echo-4o-Image, a 180K-scale
synthetic dataset generated by GPT-4o, harnessing the power of synthetic image
data to address blind spots in real-world coverage. Using this dataset, we
fine-tune the unified multimodal generation baseline Bagel to obtain Echo-4o.
In addition, we propose two new evaluation benchmarks for a more accurate and
challenging assessment of image generation capabilities: GenEval++, which
increases instruction complexity to mitigate score saturation, and
Imagine-Bench, which focuses on evaluating both the understanding and
generation of imaginative content. Echo-4o demonstrates strong performance
across standard benchmarks. Moreover, applying Echo-4o-Image to other
foundation models (e.g., OmniGen2, BLIP3-o) yields consistent performance gains
across multiple metrics, highlighting the datasets strong transferability.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于图神经网络的OIQA框架，通过建模视口间的结构关系来提升对空间失真非均匀性的感知能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的全向图像质量评估方法难以有效评估局部非均匀失真，原因是未能充分建模空间质量变化和缺乏有效的特征表示。

Method: 使用斐波那契球采样生成视口，将其表示为图节点，并通过多阶段特征提取网络获取高维节点表示。结合图注意力网络（GAT）和图变换器，分别建模局部和长距离的空间依赖关系。

Result: 在两个大规模OIQA数据库上的实验表明，该方法显著优于现有方法，具有强泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该方法通过建模视口间的结构关系，有效提升了全向图像质量评估的性能。

Abstract: Current Omnidirectional Image Quality Assessment (OIQA) methods struggle to
evaluate locally non-uniform distortions due to inadequate modeling of spatial
variations in quality and ineffective feature representation capturing both
local details and global context. To address this, we propose a graph neural
network-based OIQA framework that explicitly models structural relationships
between viewports to enhance perception of spatial distortion non-uniformity.
Our approach employs Fibonacci sphere sampling to generate viewports with
well-structured topology, representing each as a graph node. Multi-stage
feature extraction networks then derive high-dimensional node representation.
To holistically capture spatial dependencies, we integrate a Graph Attention
Network (GAT) modeling fine-grained local distortion variations among adjacent
viewports, and a graph transformer capturing long-range quality interactions
across distant regions. Extensive experiments on two large-scale OIQA databases
with complex spatial distortions demonstrate that our method significantly
outperforms existing approaches, confirming its effectiveness and strong
generalization capability.

Result: 结果表明对比嵌入学习和高级分割编码在有限数据下对可控人脸生成有效。

Conclusion: 论文通过改进的嵌入和编码方法提升了人脸生成的语义对齐和可控性。

Abstract: We present a benchmark of diffusion models for human face generation on a
small-scale CelebAMask-HQ dataset, evaluating both unconditional and
conditional pipelines. Our study compares UNet and DiT architectures for
unconditional generation and explores LoRA-based fine-tuning of pretrained
Stable Diffusion models as a separate experiment. Building on the
multi-conditioning approach of Giambi and Lisanti, which uses both attribute
vectors and segmentation masks, our main contribution is the integration of an
InfoNCE loss for attribute embedding and the adoption of a SegFormer-based
segmentation encoder. These enhancements improve the semantic alignment and
controllability of attribute-guided synthesis. Our results highlight the
effectiveness of contrastive embedding learning and advanced segmentation
encoding for controlled face generation in limited data settings.

TL;DR: ARI3D软件工具旨在通过交互式分析X射线CT图像中的区域，改进相位识别、考虑部分体积效应、提高检测限和量化准确性，并统一跨学科的3D定量分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: X射线CT成像技术存在固有成像伪影（如束硬化和部分体积效应），导致用户需基于体素灰度值对微结构进行分割和分类，分析过程复杂且需要大量决策。

Method: 开发ARI3D软件工具，通过交互式分析3D X射线CT图像中的区域，辅助用户完成分类和量化协议中的各个步骤。

Result: ARI3D能够改进相位识别、处理部分体积效应、提高检测限和量化准确性，并支持跨学科的3D定量分析。

Conclusion: ARI3D为X射线CT图像的定量分析提供了一种高效、交互式的解决方案，有望在不同科学领域推广使用。

Abstract: X-ray computed tomography (CT) is the main 3D technique for imaging the
internal microstructures of materials. Quantitative analysis of the
microstructures is usually achieved by applying a sequence of steps that are
implemented to the entire 3D image. This is challenged by various imaging
artifacts inherent from the technique, e.g., beam hardening and partial volume.
Consequently, the analysis requires users to make a number of decisions to
segment and classify the microstructures based on the voxel gray-values. In
this context, a software tool, here called ARI3D, is proposed to interactively
analyze regions in three-dimensional X-ray CT images, assisting users through
the various steps of a protocol designed to classify and quantify objects
within regions of a three-dimensional image. ARI3D aims to 1) Improve phase
identification; 2) Account for partial volume effect; 3) Increase the detection
limit and accuracy of object quantification; and 4) Harmonize quantitative 3D
analysis that can be implemented in different fields of science.

TL;DR: 研究发现，视觉变换器（ViTs）在图像识别任务中表现出色，但其与人类感知的对齐程度受模型大小、数据集规模、数据增强和正则化影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索ViTs与人类感知的对齐程度，以了解模型复杂性和训练策略如何影响其感知表现。

Method: 在TID2013数据集上系统分析模型大小、数据集规模、数据增强和正则化对ViT感知对齐的影响。

Result: 大模型对齐度更低；增加数据集多样性影响小，但重复训练图像会降低对齐度；强数据增强和正则化进一步降低对齐度。

Conclusion: 模型复杂性、训练策略与人类感知对齐之间存在权衡，需在应用中权衡这些因素。

Abstract: Vision Transformers (ViTs) achieve remarkable performance in image
recognition tasks, yet their alignment with human perception remains largely
unexplored. This study systematically analyzes how model size, dataset size,
data augmentation and regularization impact ViT perceptual alignment with human
judgments on the TID2013 dataset. Our findings confirm that larger models
exhibit lower perceptual alignment, consistent with previous works. Increasing
dataset diversity has a minimal impact, but exposing models to the same images
more times reduces alignment. Stronger data augmentation and regularization
further decrease alignment, especially in models exposed to repeated training
cycles. These results highlight a trade-off between model complexity, training
strategies, and alignment with human perception, raising important
considerations for applications requiring human-like visual understanding.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合连续和离散视频VAE的方法OneVAE，通过利用连续VAE的先验知识，显著提升了离散视频VAE的训练速度和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 离散视频VAE存在训练不稳定、时间长和重建质量差的问题，而连续VAE训练更容易且性能优越。因此，研究如何利用连续VAE的优势来改进离散视频VAE。

Method: 1. 使用FSQ方法保留连续VAE的先验知识；2. 引入多令牌量化机制提升重建质量；3. 加强首帧重建以优化高压缩视频VAE；4. 提出联合离散-连续优化方案。

Result: OneVAE收敛速度快数倍，重建质量显著提升（PSNR提高近1 dB），并在单一网络中同时实现连续和离散表示的高性能。

Conclusion: OneVAE成功结合了连续和离散VAE的优势，为多模态LLM提供了高效的视频编码方案。

Abstract: Encoding videos into discrete tokens could align with text tokens to
facilitate concise and unified multi-modal LLMs, yet introducing significant
spatiotemporal compression compared to continuous video representation.
Previous discrete video VAEs experienced unstable training, long training time,
and degraded reconstruction quality. Given the easier training and superior
performance of continuous VAEs, an intuitive idea is to enhance discrete video
VAEs by leveraging continuous VAEs. After rethinking the intrinsic link between
discrete and continuous representations, we found that FSQ could effectively
preserve pre-trained continuous VAE priors compared to other quantization
methods. By leveraging continuous VAE priors, it converges several times faster
than training from scratch and achieves superior performance at convergence.
Meanwhile, two structural improvements are proposed. First, inspired by how
continuous VAEs enhance reconstruction via enlarged latent dimensions, we
introduce a multi-token quantization mechanism, which achieves nearly a 1 dB
improvement in PSNR without compromising the token compression ratio. Second,
to tackle reconstruction challenges in high-compression video VAEs, we
strengthen first-frame reconstruction, enabling the causal VAE to leverage this
information in subsequent frames and markedly improving the performance of 4 x
16 x 16 discrete VAEs. Furthermore, we propose a joint discrete-continuous
optimization scheme that unifies the two paradigms and, for the first time,
achieves competitive performance on both continuous and discrete
representations within a single network. We name our method OneVAE to reflect
this connection.

Motivation: 当前方法在3D建模和细节保留上存在几何不一致与粗糙重建问题，且生成能力弱导致运动泛化和场景不协调。

Method: HumanGenesis整合几何与生成建模，包含Reconstructor、Critique Agent、Pose Guider和Video Harmonizer四个代理。

Result: HumanGenesis在文本引导合成、视频重演和新姿势泛化任务中达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: HumanGenesis显著提升了表达力、几何保真度和场景整合能力。

Abstract: \textbf{Synthetic human dynamics} aims to generate photorealistic videos of
human subjects performing expressive, intention-driven motions. However,
current approaches face two core challenges: (1) \emph{geometric inconsistency}
and \emph{coarse reconstruction}, due to limited 3D modeling and detail
preservation; and (2) \emph{motion generalization limitations} and \emph{scene
inharmonization}, stemming from weak generative capabilities. To address these,
we present \textbf{HumanGenesis}, a framework that integrates geometric and
generative modeling through four collaborative agents: (1)
\textbf{Reconstructor} builds 3D-consistent human-scene representations from
monocular video using 3D Gaussian Splatting and deformation decomposition. (2)
\textbf{Critique Agent} enhances reconstruction fidelity by identifying and
refining poor regions via multi-round MLLM-based reflection. (3) \textbf{Pose
Guider} enables motion generalization by generating expressive pose sequences
using time-aware parametric encoders. (4) \textbf{Video Harmonizer} synthesizes
photorealistic, coherent video via a hybrid rendering pipeline with diffusion,
refining the Reconstructor through a Back-to-4D feedback loop. HumanGenesis
achieves state-of-the-art performance on tasks including text-guided synthesis,
video reenactment, and novel-pose generalization, significantly improving
expressiveness, geometric fidelity, and scene integration.

Motivation: 传统RGB相机在场景重建中存在光照依赖、运动模糊和动态范围有限等问题，而事件相机具有低功耗、高时间分辨率和高动态范围的优势，适合高速运动和低光场景。

Method: 提出事件驱动的初始化方案和事件自适应切片泼溅方法，结合强度重要性剪枝和自适应对比度阈值优化，实现时间感知重建。

Result: E-4DGS在多视角事件流数据集上表现优于纯事件和事件-RGB融合基线方法。

Conclusion: E-4DGS为多视角事件相机重建提供了一种新方法，推动了快速场景捕捉的探索。

Abstract: Novel view synthesis and 4D reconstruction techniques predominantly rely on
RGB cameras, thereby inheriting inherent limitations such as the dependence on
adequate lighting, susceptibility to motion blur, and a limited dynamic range.
Event cameras, offering advantages of low power, high temporal resolution and
high dynamic range, have brought a new perspective to addressing the scene
reconstruction challenges in high-speed motion and low-light scenes. To this
end, we propose E-4DGS, the first event-driven dynamic Gaussian Splatting
approach, for novel view synthesis from multi-view event streams with
fast-moving cameras. Specifically, we introduce an event-based initialization
scheme to ensure stable training and propose event-adaptive slicing splatting
for time-aware reconstruction. Additionally, we employ intensity importance
pruning to eliminate floating artifacts and enhance 3D consistency, while
incorporating an adaptive contrast threshold for more precise optimization. We
design a synthetic multi-view camera setup with six moving event cameras
surrounding the object in a 360-degree configuration and provide a benchmark
multi-view event stream dataset that captures challenging motion scenarios. Our
approach outperforms both event-only and event-RGB fusion baselines and paves
the way for the exploration of multi-view event-based reconstruction as a novel
approach for rapid scene capture.

Motivation: 探索如何简化视觉上下文学习过程，避免复杂训练和数据需求，提高通用性。

Method: 在Stable Diffusion的自注意力层中重新计算注意力，显式结合查询和示例提示的上下文。

Result: 该方法在六个视觉任务上表现优异，例如在Pascal-5i数据集上，前景分割任务的mIoU提升了8.9%。

Conclusion: 现成的Stable Diffusion模型可通过简单修改实现高效的视觉上下文学习，且支持多提示集成以进一步提升性能。

Abstract: Large language models (LLM) in natural language processing (NLP) have
demonstrated great potential for in-context learning (ICL) -- the ability to
leverage a few sets of example prompts to adapt to various tasks without having
to explicitly update the model weights. ICL has recently been explored for
computer vision tasks with promising early outcomes. These approaches involve
specialized training and/or additional data that complicate the process and
limit its generalizability. In this work, we show that off-the-shelf Stable
Diffusion models can be repurposed for visual in-context learning (V-ICL).
Specifically, we formulate an in-place attention re-computation within the
self-attention layers of the Stable Diffusion architecture that explicitly
incorporates context between the query and example prompts. Without any
additional fine-tuning, we show that this repurposed Stable Diffusion model is
able to adapt to six different tasks: foreground segmentation, single object
detection, semantic segmentation, keypoint detection, edge detection, and
colorization. For example, the proposed approach improves the mean intersection
over union (mIoU) for the foreground segmentation task on Pascal-5i dataset by
8.9% and 3.2% over recent methods such as Visual Prompting and IMProv,
respectively. Additionally, we show that the proposed method is able to
effectively leverage multiple prompts through ensembling to infer the task
better and further improve the performance.

Abstract: Detection of face forgery videos remains a formidable challenge in the field
of digital forensics, especially the generalization to unseen datasets and
common perturbations. In this paper, we tackle this issue by leveraging the
synergy between audio and visual speech elements, embarking on a novel approach
through audio-visual speech representation learning. Our work is motivated by
the finding that audio signals, enriched with speech content, can provide
precise information effectively reflecting facial movements. To this end, we
first learn precise audio-visual speech representations on real videos via a
self-supervised masked prediction task, which encodes both local and global
semantic information simultaneously. Then, the derived model is directly
transferred to the forgery detection task. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in terms of
cross-dataset generalization and robustness, without the participation of any
fake video in model training. Code is available at

Abstract: We present Story2Board, a training-free framework for expressive storyboard
generation from natural language. Existing methods narrowly focus on subject
identity, overlooking key aspects of visual storytelling such as spatial
composition, background evolution, and narrative pacing. To address this, we
introduce a lightweight consistency framework composed of two components:
Latent Panel Anchoring, which preserves a shared character reference across
panels, and Reciprocal Attention Value Mixing, which softly blends visual
features between token pairs with strong reciprocal attention. Together, these
mechanisms enhance coherence without architectural changes or fine-tuning,
enabling state-of-the-art diffusion models to generate visually diverse yet
consistent storyboards. To structure generation, we use an off-the-shelf
language model to convert free-form stories into grounded panel-level prompts.
To evaluate, we propose the Rich Storyboard Benchmark, a suite of open-domain
narratives designed to assess layout diversity and background-grounded
storytelling, in addition to consistency. We also introduce a new Scene
Diversity metric that quantifies spatial and pose variation across storyboards.
Our qualitative and quantitative results, as well as a user study, show that
Story2Board produces more dynamic, coherent, and narratively engaging
storyboards than existing baselines.

5.2% and overall F1 classification score by 23.7%, while using 5x fewer
parameters. Notably, HistoPLUS unlocks the study of 7 understudied cell types
and brings significant improvements on 8 of 13 cell types. Moreover, we show
that HistoPLUS robustly transfers to two oncology indications unseen during
training. To support broader TME biomarker research, we release the model

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决历史手稿数字化中HTR系统因数据分布差异导致的性能问题，尤其是小规模、特定作者手写集的识别挑战。

Method: 系统比较了三种HTG模型（生成对抗、扩散和自回归范式），分析合成数据的视觉和语言特征对HTR微调的影响。

Result: 提供了选择最有效HTG模型的量化指南，揭示了当前HTG方法的能力及在低资源HTR中的应用改进方向。

Conclusion: HTG模型在提升低资源HTR性能方面具有潜力，但仍需进一步改进。

Abstract: The digitization of historical manuscripts presents significant challenges
for Handwritten Text Recognition (HTR) systems, particularly when dealing with
small, author-specific collections that diverge from the training data
distributions. Handwritten Text Generation (HTG) techniques, which generate
synthetic data tailored to specific handwriting styles, offer a promising
solution to address these challenges. However, the effectiveness of various HTG
models in enhancing HTR performance, especially in low-resource transcription
settings, has not been thoroughly evaluated. In this work, we systematically
compare three state-of-the-art styled HTG models (representing the generative
adversarial, diffusion, and autoregressive paradigms for HTG) to assess their
impact on HTR fine-tuning. We analyze how visual and linguistic characteristics
of synthetic data influence fine-tuning outcomes and provide quantitative
guidelines for selecting the most effective HTG model. The results of our
analysis provide insights into the current capabilities of HTG methods and
highlight key areas for further improvement in their application to
low-resource HTR.

*Tomás de la Sotta,José M. Saavedra,Héctor Henríquez,Violeta Chang,Aline Xavier*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AST-n框架通过从中间噪声水平启动反向扩散并集成高阶ODE求解器，加速LDCT去噪推理，显著减少时间且保持图像质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 低剂量CT（LDCT）减少辐射但增加图像噪声，影响诊断信心，需高效去噪方法。

Method: 提出AST-n框架，结合高阶ODE求解器，减少采样步骤，评估其在LDCT数据集上的表现。

Result: AST-25仅需25步，PSNR>38 dB，SSIM>0.95，推理时间从16秒降至1秒/切片。

Conclusion: AST-n与高阶求解器结合，实现快速LDCT重建，提升扩散模型在临床中的可行性。

Abstract: Low-dose CT (LDCT) protocols reduce radiation exposure but increase image
noise, compromising diagnostic confidence. Diffusion-based generative models
have shown promise for LDCT denoising by learning image priors and performing
iterative refinement. In this work, we introduce AST-n, an accelerated
inference framework that initiates reverse diffusion from intermediate noise
levels, and integrate high-order ODE solvers within conditioned models to
further reduce sampling steps. We evaluate two acceleration paradigms--AST-n
sampling and standard scheduling with high-order solvers -- on the Low Dose CT
Grand Challenge dataset, covering head, abdominal, and chest scans at 10-25 %
of standard dose. Conditioned models using only 25 steps (AST-25) achieve peak
signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) above 38 dB and structural similarity index (SSIM)
above 0.95, closely matching standard baselines while cutting inference time
from ~16 seg to under 1 seg per slice. Unconditional sampling suffers
substantial quality loss, underscoring the necessity of conditioning. We also
assess DDIM inversion, which yields marginal PSNR gains at the cost of doubling
inference time, limiting its clinical practicality. Our results demonstrate
that AST-n with high-order samplers enables rapid LDCT reconstruction without
significant loss of image fidelity, advancing the feasibility of
diffusion-based methods in clinical workflows.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LIA-X是一种新型可解释的肖像动画生成器，通过线性导航潜在空间中的运动代码实现面部动态迁移，支持精细控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法（如'warp-render'）缺乏对精细面部语义的可控性，LIA-X旨在通过可解释的稀疏运动字典实现更精确的动态迁移。

Method: LIA-X采用自编码器架构，结合稀疏运动字典将面部动态分解为可解释因子，支持'edit-warp-render'策略。

Result: 实验表明，LIA-X在自重现和跨重现任务中优于现有方法，并支持用户引导的精细编辑和3D感知视频操作。

Conclusion: LIA-X通过可解释性和可控性，为肖像动画和视频编辑提供了高效且实用的解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce LIA-X, a novel interpretable portrait animator designed to
transfer facial dynamics from a driving video to a source portrait with
fine-grained control. LIA-X is an autoencoder that models motion transfer as a
linear navigation of motion codes in latent space. Crucially, it incorporates a
novel Sparse Motion Dictionary that enables the model to disentangle facial
dynamics into interpretable factors. Deviating from previous 'warp-render'
approaches, the interpretability of the Sparse Motion Dictionary allows LIA-X
to support a highly controllable 'edit-warp-render' strategy, enabling precise
manipulation of fine-grained facial semantics in the source portrait. This
helps to narrow initial differences with the driving video in terms of pose and
expression. Moreover, we demonstrate the scalability of LIA-X by successfully
training a large-scale model with approximately 1 billion parameters on
extensive datasets. Experimental results show that our proposed method
outperforms previous approaches in both self-reenactment and cross-reenactment
tasks across several benchmarks. Additionally, the interpretable and
controllable nature of LIA-X supports practical applications such as
fine-grained, user-guided image and video editing, as well as 3D-aware portrait
video manipulation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种Meta-Optimized Classifier (MOC)，通过元学习优化分类器配置，显著提升了少样本条件下的WSI分类性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于视觉语言基础模型（VLFM）的少样本学习方法在数据稀缺时表现不佳，需要改进。

Method: MOC包含元学习器和分类器库，自动优化分类器配置。

Result: 在TCGA-NSCLC基准测试中，MOC的AUC比现有方法提高10.4%，1-shot条件下提升26.25%。

Conclusion: MOC为临床部署中数据稀缺问题提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in histopathology vision-language foundation models (VLFMs)
have shown promise in addressing data scarcity for whole slide image (WSI)
classification via zero-shot adaptation. However, these methods remain
outperformed by conventional multiple instance learning (MIL) approaches
trained on large datasets, motivating recent efforts to enhance VLFM-based WSI
classification through fewshot learning paradigms. While existing few-shot
methods improve diagnostic accuracy with limited annotations, their reliance on
conventional classifier designs introduces critical vulnerabilities to data
scarcity. To address this problem, we propose a Meta-Optimized Classifier (MOC)
comprising two core components: (1) a meta-learner that automatically optimizes
a classifier configuration from a mixture of candidate classifiers and (2) a
classifier bank housing diverse candidate classifiers to enable a holistic
pathological interpretation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MOC
outperforms prior arts in multiple few-shot benchmarks. Notably, on the
TCGA-NSCLC benchmark, MOC improves AUC by 10.4% over the state-of-the-art
few-shot VLFM-based methods, with gains up to 26.25% under 1-shot conditions,
offering a critical advancement for clinical deployments where diagnostic
training data is severely limited. Code is available at

TL;DR: PERSONA框架结合3D和扩散方法，从单张图像生成个性化3D人体化身，解决身份保持和姿态驱动变形问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有3D方法需要大量姿态丰富的视频，而扩散方法难以保持身份一致性，PERSONA结合两者优势。

Method: PERSONA利用扩散方法生成姿态丰富的视频，并通过平衡采样和几何加权优化优化3D化身。

Result: 框架成功生成高质量、身份一致的3D化身，适用于多样化姿态。

Conclusion: PERSONA为单图像生成个性化3D化身提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Two major approaches exist for creating animatable human avatars. The first,
a 3D-based approach, optimizes a NeRF- or 3DGS-based avatar from videos of a
single person, achieving personalization through a disentangled identity
representation. However, modeling pose-driven deformations, such as non-rigid
cloth deformations, requires numerous pose-rich videos, which are costly and
impractical to capture in daily life. The second, a diffusion-based approach,
learns pose-driven deformations from large-scale in-the-wild videos but
struggles with identity preservation and pose-dependent identity entanglement.
We present PERSONA, a framework that combines the strengths of both approaches
to obtain a personalized 3D human avatar with pose-driven deformations from a
single image. PERSONA leverages a diffusion-based approach to generate
pose-rich videos from the input image and optimizes a 3D avatar based on them.
To ensure high authenticity and sharp renderings across diverse poses, we
introduce balanced sampling and geometry-weighted optimization. Balanced
sampling oversamples the input image to mitigate identity shifts in
diffusion-generated training videos. Geometry-weighted optimization prioritizes
geometry constraints over image loss, preserving rendering quality in diverse
poses.

Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型（VLMs）计算和内存需求高，现有压缩方法存在局限性，如缺乏模块化分解、评估任务单一、未探索联合压缩。

Method: 提出LLMC+基准测试工具包，支持多种算法，系统研究令牌级和模型级压缩。

Result: 发现空间和时间冗余需不同策略，多任务中令牌减少方法性能下降，联合压缩可实现高效压缩。

Conclusion: LLMC+有助于公平评估和高效VLM研究，代码已开源。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) exhibit impressive multi-modal
capabilities but suffer from prohibitive computational and memory demands, due
to their long visual token sequences and massive parameter sizes. To address
these issues, recent works have proposed training-free compression methods.
However, existing efforts often suffer from three major limitations: (1)
Current approaches do not decompose techniques into comparable modules,
hindering fair evaluation across spatial and temporal redundancy. (2)
Evaluation confined to simple single-turn tasks, failing to reflect performance
in realistic scenarios. (3) Isolated use of individual compression techniques,
without exploring their joint potential. To overcome these gaps, we introduce
LLMC+, a comprehensive VLM compression benchmark with a versatile,
plug-and-play toolkit. LLMC+ supports over 20 algorithms across five
representative VLM families and enables systematic study of token-level and
model-level compression. Our benchmark reveals that: (1) Spatial and temporal
redundancies demand distinct technical strategies. (2) Token reduction methods
degrade significantly in multi-turn dialogue and detail-sensitive tasks. (3)
Combining token and model compression achieves extreme compression with minimal
performance loss. We believe LLMC+ will facilitate fair evaluation and inspire
future research in efficient VLM. Our code is available at

*Soumia Mehimeh*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: DQInit是一种将值函数初始化（VFI）扩展到深度强化学习（DRL）的方法，通过重用先前任务的紧凑表格Q值作为可转移知识库，提升早期学习效率和性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在DRL中扩展VFI面临状态-动作空间连续性、神经网络噪声近似和存储过去模型不切实际等挑战。

Method: DQInit利用基于已知度的机制，将转移值软整合到未探索区域，并逐步转向代理的学习估计。

Result: 实验表明，DQInit在连续控制任务中显著提升了早期学习效率、稳定性和整体性能。

Conclusion: DQInit为DRL中的知识转移提供了新视角，仅依赖值估计而非策略或演示，结合了跳启动RL和策略蒸馏的优势。

Abstract: Value function initialization (VFI) is an effective way to achieve a
jumpstart in reinforcement learning (RL) by leveraging value estimates from
prior tasks. While this approach is well established in tabular settings,
extending it to deep reinforcement learning (DRL) poses challenges due to the
continuous nature of the state-action space, the noisy approximations of neural
networks, and the impracticality of storing all past models for reuse. In this
work, we address these challenges and introduce DQInit, a method that adapts
value function initialization to DRL. DQInit reuses compact tabular Q-values
extracted from previously solved tasks as a transferable knowledge base. It
employs a knownness-based mechanism to softly integrate these transferred
values into underexplored regions and gradually shift toward the agent's
learned estimates, avoiding the limitations of fixed time decay. Our approach
offers a novel perspective on knowledge transfer in DRL by relying solely on
value estimates rather than policies or demonstrations, effectively combining
the strengths of jumpstart RL and policy distillation while mitigating their
drawbacks. Experiments across multiple continuous control tasks demonstrate
that DQInit consistently improves early learning efficiency, stability, and
overall performance compared to standard initialization and existing transfer
techniques.

TL;DR: 论文介绍了Othello AI Arena，一个用于评估AI系统在有限时间内适应新环境能力的新型基准框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI基准大多关注固定环境下的性能优化，缺乏对系统灵活性和泛化能力的评估，尤其是在面对规则或结构变化时。

Method: 通过Othello AI Arena，提出一个元学习挑战：系统需在60秒内分析新Othello棋盘配置并生成定制策略，从而分离元级智能与任务级策略性能的评估。

Result: 初步测试和学生参与展示了多样的适应方法，如快速参数调整和通过模拟学习环境模型。

Conclusion: Othello AI Arena为培养和评估AI系统的快速智能适应能力提供了独特的教育工具和研究基准。

Abstract: The ability to rapidly adapt to novel and unforeseen environmental changes is
a cornerstone of artificial general intelligence (AGI), yet it remains a
critical blind spot in most existing AI benchmarks. Traditional evaluation
largely focuses on optimizing performance within fixed environments, failing to
assess systems' flexibility and generalization capabilities when faced with
even subtle rule or structural modifications. Addressing this gap, I introduce
the Othello AI Arena, a novel benchmark framework designed to evaluate
intelligent systems based on their capacity for limited-time adaptation to
unseen environments. Our platform poses a meta-learning challenge: participants
must develop systems that can analyze the specific configuration and rules of a
novel Othello board within a strict time limit (60 seconds) and generate a
tailored, high-performing strategy for that unique environment. With this,
evaluation of the meta-level intelligence can be separated from the task-level
strategy performance. The Arena features a diverse set of game stages,
including public stages for development and private stages with structural and
rule variations designed to test genuine adaptive and generalization
capabilities. Implemented as an accessible web-based platform, the Arena
provides real-time visualization, automated evaluation using multi-dimensional
metrics, and comprehensive logging for post-hoc analysis. Initial observations
from pilot tests and preliminary student engagements highlight fascinating
patterns in adaptation approaches, ranging from rapid parameter tuning to
rudimentary environmental model learning through simulation. The Othello AI
Arena offers a unique educational tool and a valuable research benchmark for
fostering and evaluating the crucial skill of rapid, intelligent adaptation in
AI systems.

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著提高了任务成功率和解决方案效率。

Conclusion: LLM驱动的课程学习在提升复杂领域自动推理能力方面具有潜力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across
diverse domains, including programming, planning, and decision-making. However,
their performance often degrades when faced with highly complex problem
instances that require deep reasoning over long horizons. In such cases, direct
problem-solving approaches can lead to inefficiency or failure due to the lack
of structured intermediate guidance. To address this, we propose a novel
self-evolve framework, EvoCurr, in which a dedicated curriculum-generation LLM
constructs a sequence of problem instances with gradually increasing
difficulty, tailored to the solver LLM's learning progress. The curriculum
dynamically adapts easing challenges when the solver struggles and escalating
them when success is consistent, thus maintaining an optimal learning
trajectory. This approach enables the solver LLM, implemented as a
code-generation model producing Python decision-tree scripts, to progressively
acquire the skills needed for complex decision-making tasks. Experimental
results on challenging decision-making benchmarks show that our method
significantly improves task success rates and solution efficiency compared to
direct-solving baselines. These findings suggest that LLM-driven curriculum
learning holds strong potential for enhancing automated reasoning in
real-world, high-complexity domains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLM在关键社会功能中的自主性增强，现有安全基准未能系统评估模型在目标冲突情境下的决策行为，亟需新工具填补这一空白。

Method: 提出PacifAIst基准，包含700个挑战性场景，围绕Existential Prioritization（EP）分类测试模型行为。

Result: 评估8个主流LLM，Google Gemini 2.5 Flash表现最佳（P-Score 90.31%），GPT-5表现最差（79.49%），模型在子类别中表现差异显著。

Conclusion: PacifAIst为标准化工具，可帮助测量和缓解目标冲突风险，确保AI行为优先符合人类安全。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) become increasingly autonomous and integrated
into critical societal functions, the focus of AI safety must evolve from
mitigating harmful content to evaluating underlying behavioral alignment.
Current safety benchmarks do not systematically probe a model's decision-making
in scenarios where its own instrumental goals - such as self-preservation,
resource acquisition, or goal completion - conflict with human safety. This
represents a critical gap in our ability to measure and mitigate risks
associated with emergent, misaligned behaviors. To address this, we introduce
PacifAIst (Procedural Assessment of Complex Interactions for Foundational
Artificial Intelligence Scenario Testing), a focused benchmark of 700
challenging scenarios designed to quantify self-preferential behavior in LLMs.
The benchmark is structured around a novel taxonomy of Existential
Prioritization (EP), with subcategories testing Self-Preservation vs. Human
Safety (EP1), Resource Conflict (EP2), and Goal Preservation vs. Evasion (EP3).
We evaluated eight leading LLMs. The results reveal a significant performance
hierarchy. Google's Gemini 2.5 Flash achieved the highest Pacifism Score
(P-Score) at 90.31%, demonstrating strong human-centric alignment. In a
surprising result, the much-anticipated GPT-5 recorded the lowest P-Score
(79.49%), indicating potential alignment challenges. Performance varied
significantly across subcategories, with models like Claude Sonnet 4 and
Mistral Medium struggling notably in direct self-preservation dilemmas. These
findings underscore the urgent need for standardized tools like PacifAIst to
measure and mitigate risks from instrumental goal conflicts, ensuring future AI
systems are not only helpful in conversation but also provably "pacifist" in
their behavioral priorities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: SHAP值通常被视为点估计，忽略了预测模型和数据中的不确定性，这在高风险领域（如医疗分析）中尤为重要。

Method: 通过Dempster-Shafer证据理论和Dirichlet过程采样，分解SHAP值的不确定性为偶然性、认知性和纠缠成分。

Result: 实验表明，SHAP值最高的特征不一定最稳定，认知性不确定性可通过更好的数据和模型开发技术减少。

Conclusion: 该方法为SHAP解释的可靠性和可解释性提供了更全面的理解，有助于高风险应用中的决策和模型优化。

Abstract: Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques, such as SHapley
Additive exPlanations (SHAP), have become essential tools for interpreting
complex ensemble tree-based models, especially in high-stakes domains such as
healthcare analytics. However, SHAP values are usually treated as point
estimates, which disregards the inherent and ubiquitous uncertainty in
predictive models and data. This uncertainty has two primary sources: aleatoric
and epistemic. The aleatoric uncertainty, which reflects the irreducible noise
in the data. The epistemic uncertainty, which arises from a lack of data. In
this work, we propose an approach for decomposing uncertainty in SHAP values
into aleatoric, epistemic, and entanglement components. This approach
integrates Dempster-Shafer evidence theory and hypothesis sampling via
Dirichlet processes over tree ensembles. We validate the method across three
real-world use cases with descriptive statistical analyses that provide insight
into the nature of epistemic uncertainty embedded in SHAP explanations. The
experimentations enable to provide more comprehensive understanding of the
reliability and interpretability of SHAP-based attributions. This understanding
can guide the development of robust decision-making processes and the
refinement of models in high-stakes applications. Through our experiments with
multiple datasets, we concluded that features with the highest SHAP values are
not necessarily the most stable. This epistemic uncertainty can be reduced
through better, more representative data and following appropriate or
case-desired model development techniques. Tree-based models, especially
bagging, facilitate the effective quantification of epistemic uncertainty.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准RLVR在奖励稀疏情况下学习信号不足，尤其在复杂任务中表现不佳。

Method: 提出MEML-GRPO框架，利用多样化专家提示生成更广的响应范围，并引入专家间互学习机制。

Result: 在多个推理基准测试中，MEML-GRPO平均性能提升4.89%（Qwen）和11.33%（Llama）。

Conclusion: MEML-GRPO有效克服传统RLVR的核心限制，显著提升模型表现。

Abstract: Recent advances demonstrate that reinforcement learning with verifiable
rewards (RLVR) significantly enhances the reasoning capabilities of large
language models (LLMs). However, standard RLVR faces challenges with reward
sparsity, where zero rewards from consistently incorrect candidate answers
provide no learning signal, particularly in challenging tasks. To address this,
we propose Multi-Expert Mutual Learning GRPO (MEML-GRPO), an innovative
framework that utilizes diverse expert prompts as system prompts to generate a
broader range of responses, substantially increasing the likelihood of
identifying correct solutions. Additionally, we introduce an inter-expert
mutual learning mechanism that facilitates knowledge sharing and transfer among
experts, further boosting the model's performance through RLVR. Extensive
experiments across multiple reasoning benchmarks show that MEML-GRPO delivers
significant improvements, achieving an average performance gain of 4.89% with
Qwen and 11.33% with Llama, effectively overcoming the core limitations of
traditional RLVR methods.

TL;DR: 论文提出UDA框架，通过动态调整Elo评分系统减少LLM评估中的偏好偏差，显著降低评委间分歧并提升与人类判断的相关性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM的成对评估存在偏好偏差，导致评委间排名不一致。

Method: 提出UDA框架，通过无监督学习动态调整Elo评分系统的K因子和胜率，最小化评委间评分差异。

Result: UDA将评委间评分标准差降低63.4%，与人类判断相关性提升24.7%。

Conclusion: UDA有效减少系统偏差，提升评估的稳定性和可靠性。

Abstract: Pairwise evaluation of Large Language Models (LLMs) is a common paradigm, but
it is prone to preference bias, where judges systematically favor certain
outputs, such as their own. This bias leads to inconsistent and skewed rankings
across different judges. To address this, we first empirically demonstrate
significant and heterogeneous biases in cross-model evaluations. We then
propose UDA (Unsupervised Debiasing Alignment), a framework that reduces
inter-judge disagreement by dynamically adjusting the Elo rating system. For
each pairwise comparison, a compact neural network learns to adaptively set the
K-factor and refine win probabilities. Crucially, UDA operates in a fully
unsupervised manner, guided solely by the objective of minimizing the
dispersion among the Elo trajectories of all judges. This forces an alignment
towards a collective consensus, which serves as an unsupervised proxy for a
more stable and reproducible evaluation. In addition, we provide theoretical
motivation demonstrating how alignment towards a consensus can reduce aggregate
system bias. Experiments show that UDA significantly reduces the inter-judge
rating standard deviation by up to 63.4% and improves the average correlation
with human judgments by 24.7%. Notably, UDA elevates the performance of poorly
performing judges to achieve parity with high-quality ones, fostering a more
robust and reliable evaluation ecosystem. Code and data are available at

<details>

Motivation: 研究多智能体系统中基于观察的知识更新逻辑，特别是在认知规划中的应用。

Method: 提出公共观察逻辑（POL），扩展了公共公告逻辑，通过在克里普克模型中为每个状态配备预期观察集，并基于实际观察更新状态。

Result: 证明了POL的可满足性问题是2EXPTIME完全的。

Conclusion: POL为多智能体系统中的知识更新提供了有效的逻辑框架，但其计算复杂度较高。

Abstract: Logics for reasoning about knowledge and actions have seen many applications
in various domains of multi-agent systems, including epistemic planning. Change
of knowledge based on observations about the surroundings forms a key aspect in
such planning scenarios. Public Observation Logic (POL) is a variant of public
announcement logic for reasoning about knowledge that gets updated based on
public observations. Each state in an epistemic (Kripke) model is equipped with
a set of expected observations. These states evolve as the expectations get
matched with the actual observations. In this work, we prove that the
satisfiability problem of $\POL$ is 2EXPTIME-complete.

Method: 提出VIPCGRL框架，利用四重对比学习训练共享嵌入空间，并通过嵌入相似性辅助奖励对齐策略。

Result: VIPCGRL在人类相似性方面优于现有基线，定量指标和人类评估均验证了这一点。

Conclusion: VIPCGRL通过多模态和人类对齐设计，显著提升了PCGRL的实用性和人机协作效果。

Abstract: Human-aligned AI is a critical component of co-creativity, as it enables
models to accurately interpret human intent and generate controllable outputs
that align with design goals in collaborative content creation. This direction
is especially relevant in procedural content generation via reinforcement
learning (PCGRL), which is intended to serve as a tool for human designers.
However, existing systems often fall short of exhibiting human-centered
behavior, limiting the practical utility of AI-driven generation tools in
real-world design workflows. In this paper, we propose VIPCGRL
(Vision-Instruction PCGRL), a novel deep reinforcement learning framework that
incorporates three modalities-text, level, and sketches-to extend control
modality and enhance human-likeness. We introduce a shared embedding space
trained via quadruple contrastive learning across modalities and human-AI
styles, and align the policy using an auxiliary reward based on embedding
similarity. Experimental results show that VIPCGRL outperforms existing
baselines in human-likeness, as validated by both quantitative metrics and
human evaluations. The code and dataset will be available upon publication.

Motivation: 随着大型语言模型（LLM）的快速发展，智能代理依赖多种外部工具解决复杂问题，但多工具带来的上下文扩展和噪声输出会降低系统可靠性，因此需要增强稳定性。

Method: 在AWorld框架中构建动态MAS架构，Execution Agent在关键步骤调用Guard Agent验证和修正推理过程，减少噪声导致的错误。

Result: 在GAIA测试数据集上的实验表明，动态机动机制显著提升了解决方案的有效性和稳定性，优于单代理系统和标准工具增强系统，并在GAIA排行榜上取得第一名。

Conclusion: 动态MAS系统通过协作代理角色提升了智能系统的可靠性和可信度，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) has empowered
intelligent agents to leverage diverse external tools for solving complex
real-world problems. However, as agents increasingly depend on multiple tools,
they encounter new challenges: extended contexts from disparate sources and
noisy or irrelevant tool outputs can undermine system reliability and accuracy.
These challenges underscore the necessity for enhanced stability in agent-based
systems. To address this, we introduce dynamic supervision and maneuvering
mechanisms, constructing a robust and dynamic Multi-Agent System (MAS)
architecture within the AWorld framework. In our approach, the Execution Agent
invokes the Guard Agent at critical steps to verify and correct the reasoning
process, effectively reducing errors arising from noise and bolstering
problem-solving robustness. Extensive experiments on the GAIA test dataset
reveal that our dynamic maneuvering mechanism significantly improves both the
effectiveness and stability of solutions, outperforming single-agent system
(SAS) and standard tool-augmented systems. As a result, our dynamic MAS system
achieved first place among open-source projects on the prestigious GAIA
leaderboard. These findings highlight the practical value of collaborative
agent roles in developing more reliable and trustworthy intelligent systems.

Result: 系统在复杂监管查询中优于传统方法，确保事实正确性、可追溯性，并通过子图可视化增强理解。

Conclusion: 该框架为合规驱动和审计应用提供了坚实基础。

Abstract: Regulatory compliance question answering (QA) requires precise, verifiable
information, and domain-specific expertise, posing challenges for Large
Language Models (LLMs). In this work, we present a novel multi-agent framework
that integrates a Knowledge Graph (KG) of Regulatory triplets with
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to address these demands. First, agents
build and maintain an ontology-free KG by extracting subject--predicate--object
(SPO) triplets from regulatory documents and systematically cleaning,
normalizing, deduplicating, and updating them. Second, these triplets are
embedded and stored along with their corresponding textual sections and
metadata in a single enriched vector database, allowing for both graph-based
reasoning and efficient information retrieval. Third, an orchestrated agent
pipeline leverages triplet-level retrieval for question answering, ensuring
high semantic alignment between user queries and the factual
"who-did-what-to-whom" core captured by the graph. Our hybrid system
outperforms conventional methods in complex regulatory queries, ensuring
factual correctness with embedded triplets, enabling traceability through a
unified vector database, and enhancing understanding through subgraph
visualization, providing a robust foundation for compliance-driven and broader
audit-focused applications.

Result: OpenAI o1模型表现最优，双代理配置显著提升性能，程序性错误最常见。

Conclusion: 研究为提升LLMs性能提供了可行策略，推动了AI在数学教育中的应用。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly utilized in AI-driven
educational instruction and assessment, particularly within mathematics
education. The capability of LLMs to generate accurate answers and detailed
solutions for math problem-solving tasks is foundational for ensuring reliable
and precise feedback and assessment in math education practices. Our study
focuses on evaluating the accuracy of four LLMs (OpenAI GPT-4o and o1,
DeepSeek-V3 and DeepSeek-R1) solving three categories of math tasks, including
arithmetic, algebra, and number theory, and identifies step-level reasoning
errors within their solutions. Instead of relying on standard benchmarks, we
intentionally build math tasks (via item models) that are challenging for LLMs
and prone to errors. The accuracy of final answers and the presence of errors
in individual solution steps were systematically analyzed and coded. Both
single-agent and dual-agent configurations were tested. It is observed that the
reasoning-enhanced OpenAI o1 model consistently achieved higher or nearly
perfect accuracy across all three math task categories. Analysis of errors
revealed that procedural slips were the most frequent and significantly
impacted overall performance, while conceptual misunderstandings were less
frequent. Deploying dual-agent configurations substantially improved overall
performance. These findings offer actionable insights into enhancing LLM
performance and underscore effective strategies for integrating LLMs into
mathematics education, thereby advancing AI-driven instructional practices and
assessment precision.

*Liping Huang,Yicheng Zhang,Yifang Yin,Sheng Zhang,Yi Zhang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种基于特征标记化的Transformer模型，用于实时预测飞机的ETA，提高了准确性和计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实时ETA预测对航空到达管理至关重要，尤其是在跑道排序中，需要同时兼顾预测效率和准确性。

Method: 采用特征标记化将原始输入投影到潜在空间，利用Transformer的多头自注意力机制捕捉关键特征，避免了复杂的特征工程，并支持高频并行计算。

Result: 实验表明，该方法比常用的XGBoost模型准确率提高7%，计算时间仅需39%，且在40架飞机同时飞行时，推断时间仅为51.7微秒。

Conclusion: 该方法在实时到达管理系统中表现出色，具备高准确性和高效性。

Abstract: Estimated time of arrival (ETA) for airborne aircraft in real-time is crucial
for arrival management in aviation, particularly for runway sequencing. Given
the rapidly changing airspace context, the ETA prediction efficiency is as
important as its accuracy in a real-time arrival aircraft management system. In
this study, we utilize a feature tokenization-based Transformer model to
efficiently predict aircraft ETA. Feature tokenization projects raw inputs to
latent spaces, while the multi-head self-attention mechanism in the Transformer
captures important aspects of the projections, alleviating the need for complex
feature engineering. Moreover, the Transformer's parallel computation
capability allows it to handle ETA requests at a high frequency, i.e., 1HZ,
which is essential for a real-time arrival management system. The model inputs
include raw data, such as aircraft latitude, longitude, ground speed, theta
degree for the airport, day and hour from track data, the weather context, and
aircraft wake turbulence category. With a data sampling rate of 1HZ, the ETA
prediction is updated every second. We apply the proposed aircraft ETA
prediction approach to Singapore Changi Airport (ICAO Code: WSSS) using
one-month Automatic Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast (ADS-B) data from October
1 to October 31, 2022. In the experimental evaluation, the ETA modeling covers
all aircraft within a range of 10NM to 300NM from WSSS. The results show that
our proposed method method outperforms the commonly used boosting tree based
model, improving accuracy by 7\% compared to XGBoost, while requiring only 39\%
of its computing time. Experimental results also indicate that, with 40
aircraft in the airspace at a given timestamp, the ETA inference time is only
51.7 microseconds, making it promising for real-time arrival management
systems.

Result: 在五个模型和四个数据集上验证了MoLAN的广泛有效性，MoLAN+达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: MoLAN框架灵活且高效，能显著提升多模态情感分析的性能。

Abstract: Multimodal Sentiment Analysis aims to integrate information from various
modalities, such as audio, visual, and text, to make complementary predictions.
However, it often struggles with irrelevant or misleading visual and auditory
information. Most existing approaches typically treat the entire modality
information (e.g., a whole image, audio segment, or text paragraph) as an
independent unit for feature enhancement or denoising. They often suppress the
redundant and noise information at the risk of losing critical information. To
address this challenge, we propose MoLAN, a unified ModaLity-aware noise
dynAmic editiNg framework. Specifically, MoLAN performs modality-aware blocking
by dividing the features of each modality into multiple blocks. Each block is
then dynamically assigned a distinct denoising strength based on its noise
level and semantic relevance, enabling fine-grained noise suppression while
preserving essential multimodal information. Notably, MoLAN is a unified and
flexible framework that can be seamlessly integrated into a wide range of
multimodal models. Building upon this framework, we further introduce MoLAN+, a
new multimodal sentiment analysis approach. Experiments across five models and
four datasets demonstrate the broad effectiveness of the MoLAN framework.
Extensive evaluations show that MoLAN+ achieves the state-of-the-art
performance. The code is publicly available at

Motivation: 传统二进制指数退避方案在动态信道环境下性能不佳，现有模型方法因节点密度估计不准确导致吞吐量损失。

Method: 设计了一个基于transformer的ICL优化器，通过预收集碰撞阈值数据示例和查询碰撞案例，生成预测的竞争窗口阈值（CWT）。

Result: 实验证明该方法在未知节点密度下具有快速收敛和接近最优的吞吐量表现。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在理论和实验上均优于现有模型和深度强化学习方法。

Abstract: The binary exponential backoff scheme is widely used in WiFi 7 and still
incurs poor throughput performance under dynamic channel environments. Recent
model-based approaches (e.g., non-persistent and $p$-persistent CSMA) simply
optimize backoff strategies under a known and fixed node density, still leading
to a large throughput loss due to inaccurate node density estimation. This
paper is the first to propose LLM transformer-based in-context learning (ICL)
theory for optimizing channel access. We design a transformer-based ICL
optimizer to pre-collect collision-threshold data examples and a query
collision case. They are constructed as a prompt as the input for the
transformer to learn the pattern, which then generates a predicted contention
window threshold (CWT). To train the transformer for effective ICL, we develop
an efficient algorithm and guarantee a near-optimal CWT prediction within
limited training steps. As it may be hard to gather perfect data examples for
ICL in practice, we further extend to allow erroneous data input in the prompt.
We prove that our optimizer maintains minimal prediction and throughput
deviations from the optimal values. Experimental results on NS-3 further
demonstrate our approach's fast convergence and near-optimal throughput over
existing model-based and DRL-based approaches under unknown node densities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨复杂序列混合器（如注意力机制）是否真正必要，挑战“更深更复杂架构必然更好”的假设。

Method: 提出JustDense，用密集层替代序列混合器，基于MatrixMixer框架进行系统实验。

Result: 在29个基准测试中，密集层替代序列混合器性能相当或更优，部分情况下复杂混合器仍有优势。

Conclusion: 复杂序列混合器并非必需，简单架构在时间序列分析中可能足够高效。

Abstract: Sequence and channel mixers, the core mechanism in sequence models, have
become the de facto standard in time series analysis (TSA). However, recent
studies have questioned the necessity of complex sequence mixers, such as
attention mechanisms, demonstrating that simpler architectures can achieve
comparable or even superior performance. This suggests that the benefits
attributed to complex sequencemixers might instead emerge from other
architectural or optimization factors. Based on this observation, we pose a
central question: Are common sequence mixers necessary for time-series
analysis? Therefore, we propose JustDense, an empirical study that
systematically replaces sequence mixers in various well-established TSA models
with dense layers. Grounded in the MatrixMixer framework, JustDense treats any
sequence mixer as a mixing matrix and replaces it with a dense layer. This
substitution isolates the mixing operation, enabling a clear theoretical
foundation for understanding its role. Therefore, we conducted extensive
experiments on 29 benchmarks covering five representative TSA tasks using seven
state-of-the-art TSA models to address our research question. The results show
that replacing sequence mixers with dense layers yields comparable or even
superior performance. In the cases where dedicated sequence mixers still offer
benefits, JustDense challenges the assumption that "deeper and more complex
architectures are inherently better" in TSA.

Result: 理论证明和实验结果表明，DIG2RSI优于现有方法，能准确估计同伴效应。

Conclusion: DIG2RSI为复杂网络中的同伴效应估计提供了有效且通用的解决方案。

Abstract: Estimating peer causal effects within complex real-world networks such as
social networks is challenging, primarily due to simultaneous feedback between
peers and unobserved confounders. Existing methods either address unobserved
confounders while ignoring the simultaneous feedback, or account for feedback
but under restrictive linear assumptions, thus failing to obtain accurate peer
effect estimation. In this paper, we propose DIG2RSI, a novel Deep learning
framework which leverages I-G transformation (matrix operation) and 2SRI (an
instrumental variable or IV technique) to address both simultaneous feedback
and unobserved confounding, while accommodating complex, nonlinear and
high-dimensional relationships. DIG2RSI first applies the I-G transformation to
disentangle mutual peer influences and eliminate the bias due to the
simultaneous feedback. To deal with unobserved confounding, we first construct
valid IVs from network data. In stage 1 of 2RSI, we train a neural network on
these IVs to predict peer exposure, and extract residuals as proxies for the
unobserved confounders. In the stage 2, we fit a separate neural network
augmented by an adversarial discriminator that incorporates these residuals as
a control function and enforces the learned representation to contain no
residual confounding signal. The expressive power of deep learning models in
capturing complex non-linear relationships and adversarial debiasing enhances
the effectiveness of DIG2RSI in eliminating bias from both feedback loops and
hidden confounders. We prove consistency of our estimator under standard
regularity conditions, ensuring asymptotic recovery of the true peer effect.
Empirical results on two semi-synthetic benchmarks and a real-world dataset
demonstrate that DIG2RSI outperforms existing approaches.

Method: 采用检索增强生成（RAG）和线性映射，结合语言模型生成新的文本描述，并通过迭代技术优化映射。

Result: 在两个基准多模态数据集上实验结果显示显著改进。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了模态间隙问题，且无需大量训练数据，具有实用性和高效性。

Abstract: Textual descriptions for multimodal inputs entail recurrent refinement of
queries to produce relevant output images. Despite efforts to address
challenges such as scaling model size and data volume, the cost associated with
pre-training and fine-tuning remains substantial. However, pre-trained large
multimodal models (LMMs) encounter a modality gap, characterised by a
misalignment between textual and visual representations within a common
embedding space. Although fine-tuning can potentially mitigate this gap, it is
typically expensive and impractical due to the requirement for extensive
domain-driven data. To overcome this challenge, we propose a lightweight
training-free approach utilising Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to extend
across the modality using a linear mapping, which can be computed efficiently.
During inference, this mapping is applied to images embedded by an LMM enabling
retrieval of closest textual descriptions from the training set. These textual
descriptions, in conjunction with an instruction, cater as an input prompt for
the language model to generate new textual descriptions. In addition, we
introduce an iterative technique for distilling the mapping by generating
synthetic descriptions via the language model facilitating optimisation for
standard utilised image description measures. Experimental results on two
benchmark multimodal datasets demonstrate significant improvements.

Result: 在8个基准测试中，AdaPO显著提升了模型的推理和自评估能力。

Conclusion: AdaPO通过自适应调整学习焦点，有效解决了多目标优化问题，为社区贡献了新的方法。

Abstract: Self-evaluation, a model's ability to assess the correctness of its own
output, is crucial for Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) to achieve
self-improvement in multi-turn conversations, yet largely absent in foundation
models. Recent work has employed reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance
self-evaluation; however, its fixed reward mechanism suffers from reward
hacking when optimizing multiple training objectives, leading to model
collapse. In this paper we propose AdaPO, an online reinforcement learning
framework capable of adaptively adjusting training objective in real time
according to the current training state for each task. Specifically, to
mitigate reward hacking , AdaPO introduces an Adaptive Reward Model (ARM) and a
Reward Aware Dynamic KL Regularization mechanism. ARM assesses the task's
training state from the distribution of model generated multi-turn
trajectories' performance. Reward Aware Dynamic KL replaces a fixed penalty
with dynamic coefficients which is modulated by the reward gap between
different multi-turn situations. Notably, our method automatically and smoothly
adjusts its learning focus based on sub-tasks' training progress without manual
intervention. Extensive experiments over 8 benchmarks and various models show
that our method significantly enhances both direct reasoning and
self-evaluation capability. We will release our code to contribute to the
community.

Abstract: We present a framework for fine-tuning flow-matching generative models to
enforce physical constraints and solve inverse problems in scientific systems.
Starting from a model trained on low-fidelity or observational data, we apply a
differentiable post-training procedure that minimizes weak-form residuals of
governing partial differential equations (PDEs), promoting physical consistency
and adherence to boundary conditions without distorting the underlying learned
distribution. To infer unknown physical inputs, such as source terms, material
parameters, or boundary data, we augment the generative process with a
learnable latent parameter predictor and propose a joint optimization strategy.
The resulting model produces physically valid field solutions alongside
plausible estimates of hidden parameters, effectively addressing ill-posed
inverse problems in a data-driven yet physicsaware manner. We validate our
method on canonical PDE benchmarks, demonstrating improved satisfaction of PDE
constraints and accurate recovery of latent coefficients. Our approach bridges
generative modelling and scientific inference, opening new avenues for
simulation-augmented discovery and data-efficient modelling of physical
systems.

Conclusion: EvaDrive提供了一种无需标量化的轨迹优化方法，实现了人类般的迭代决策能力。

Abstract: Autonomous driving faces significant challenges in achieving human-like
iterative decision-making, which continuously generates, evaluates, and refines
trajectory proposals. Current generation-evaluation frameworks isolate
trajectory generation from quality assessment, preventing iterative refinement
essential for planning, while reinforcement learning methods collapse
multi-dimensional preferences into scalar rewards, obscuring critical
trade-offs and yielding scalarization bias.To overcome these issues, we present
EvaDrive, a novel multi-objective reinforcement learning framework that
establishes genuine closed-loop co-evolution between trajectory generation and
evaluation via adversarial optimization. EvaDrive frames trajectory planning as
a multi-round adversarial game. In this game, a hierarchical generator
continuously proposes candidate paths by combining autoregressive intent
modeling for temporal causality with diffusion-based refinement for spatial
flexibility. These proposals are then rigorously assessed by a trainable
multi-objective critic that explicitly preserves diverse preference structures
without collapsing them into a single scalarization bias.This adversarial
interplay, guided by a Pareto frontier selection mechanism, enables iterative
multi-round refinement, effectively escaping local optima while preserving
trajectory diversity.Extensive experiments on NAVSIM and Bench2Drive benchmarks
demonstrate SOTA performance, achieving 94.9 PDMS on NAVSIM v1 (surpassing
DiffusionDrive by 6.8, DriveSuprim by 5.0, and TrajHF by 0.9) and 64.96 Driving
Score on Bench2Drive. EvaDrive generates diverse driving styles via dynamic
weighting without external preference data, introducing a closed-loop
adversarial framework for human-like iterative decision-making, offering a
novel scalarization-free trajectory optimization approach.

Motivation: 解决糖尿病研究中数据集不足的问题，通过整合数据提升低血糖预测的准确性。

Method: 系统整合15个数据集，构建包含149百万次测量的数据库，并提取两个子数据库（人口统计数据和心率数据）。

Result: 数据库显示4%的测量值处于低血糖范围，血糖与心率数据在低血糖前15至55分钟存在相关性。

Conclusion: 整合的数据集为糖尿病研究提供了重要资源，数据质量和相关性分析为未来研究提供了方向。

Abstract: Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is an autoimmune disorder that leads to the destruction
of insulin-producing cells, resulting in insulin deficiency, as to why the
affected individuals depend on external insulin injections. However, insulin
can decrease blood glucose levels and can cause hypoglycemia. Hypoglycemia is a
severe event of low blood glucose levels ($\le$70 mg/dL) with dangerous side
effects of dizziness, coma, or death. Data analysis can significantly enhance
diabetes care by identifying personal patterns and trends leading to adverse
events. Especially, machine learning (ML) models can predict glucose levels and
provide early alarms. However, diabetes and hypoglycemia research is limited by
the unavailability of large datasets. Thus, this work systematically integrates
15 datasets to provide a large database of 2510 subjects with glucose
measurements recorded every 5 minutes. In total, 149 million measurements are
included, of which 4% represent values in the hypoglycemic range. Moreover, two
sub-databases are extracted. Sub-database I includes demographics, and
sub-database II includes heart rate data. The integrated dataset provides an
equal distribution of sex and different age levels. As a further contribution,
data quality is assessed, revealing that data imbalance and missing values
present a significant challenge. Moreover, a correlation study on glucose
levels and heart rate data is conducted, showing a relation between 15 and 55
minutes before hypoglycemia.

Conclusion: PgMN为动态建筑环境中的能耗预测提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate energy consumption forecasting is essential for efficient resource
management and sustainability in the building sector. Deep learning models are
highly successful but struggle with limited historical data and become unusable
when historical data are unavailable, such as in newly constructed buildings.
On the other hand, physics-based models, such as EnergyPlus, simulate energy
consumption without relying on historical data but require extensive building
parameter specifications and considerable time to model a building. This paper
introduces a Physics-Guided Memory Network (PgMN), a neural network that
integrates predictions from deep learning and physics-based models to address
their limitations. PgMN comprises a Parallel Projection Layers to process
incomplete inputs, a Memory Unit to account for persistent biases, and a Memory
Experience Module to optimally extend forecasts beyond their input range and
produce output. Theoretical evaluation shows that components of PgMN are
mathematically valid for performing their respective tasks. The PgMN was
evaluated on short-term energy forecasting at an hourly resolution, critical
for operational decision-making in smart grid and smart building systems.
Experimental validation shows accuracy and applicability of PgMN in diverse
scenarios such as newly constructed buildings, missing data, sparse historical
data, and dynamic infrastructure changes. This paper provides a promising
solution for energy consumption forecasting in dynamic building environments,
enhancing model applicability in scenarios where historical data are limited or
unavailable or when physics-based models are inadequate.

Abstract: Next generation advanced nuclear reactors are expected to be smaller both in
size and power output, relying extensively on fully digital instrumentation and
control systems. These reactors will generate a large flow of information in
the form of multivariate time series data, conveying simultaneously various non
linear cyber physical, process, control, sensor, and operational states.
Ensuring data integrity against deception attacks is becoming increasingly
important for networked communication and a requirement for safe and reliable
operation. Current efforts to address replay attacks, almost universally focus
on watermarking or supervised anomaly detection approaches without further
identifying and characterizing the root cause of the anomaly. In addition,
these approaches rely mostly on synthetic data with uncorrelated Gaussian
process and measurement noise and full state feedback or are limited to
univariate signals, signal stationarity, linear quadratic regulators, or other
linear-time invariant state-space which may fail to capture any unmodeled
system dynamics. In the realm of regulated nuclear cyber-physical systems,
additional work is needed on characterization of replay attacks and
explainability of predictions using real data. Here, we propose an unsupervised
explainable AI framework based on a combination of autoencoder and customized
windowSHAP algorithm to fully characterize real-time replay attacks, i.e.,
detection, source identification, timing and type, of increasing complexity
during a dynamic time evolving reactor process. The proposed XAI framework was
benchmarked on several real world datasets from Purdue's nuclear reactor PUR-1
with up to six signals concurrently being replayed. In all cases, the XAI
framework was able to detect and identify the source and number of signals
being replayed and the duration of the falsification with 95 percent or better
accuracy.

Result: 在32nm工艺下，ASL方案将能耗和延迟降低超过60%，且精度损失可忽略。

Conclusion: ASL方案适用于物联网应用，展示了混合精度截断在随机计算设计中的独特优势。

Abstract: Stochastic computing (SC) has emerged as an efficient low-power alternative
for deploying neural networks (NNs) in resource-limited scenarios, such as the
Internet of Things (IoT). By encoding values as serial bitstreams, SC
significantly reduces energy dissipation compared to conventional
floating-point (FP) designs; however, further improvement of layer-wise
mixed-precision implementation for SC remains unexplored. This article
introduces Adjustable Sequence Length (ASL), a novel scheme that applies
mixed-precision concepts specifically to SC NNs. By introducing an
operator-norm-based theoretical model, this article shows that truncation noise
can cumulatively propagate through the layers by the estimated amplification
factors. An extended sensitivity analysis is presented, using random forest
(RF) regression to evaluate multilayer truncation effects and validate the
alignment of theoretical predictions with practical network behaviors. To
accommodate different application scenarios, this article proposes two
truncation strategies (coarse-grained and fine-grained), which apply diverse
sequence length configurations at each layer. Evaluations on a pipelined SC MLP
synthesized at 32nm demonstrate that ASL can reduce energy and latency
overheads by up to over 60% with negligible accuracy loss. It confirms the
feasibility of the ASL scheme for IoT applications and highlights the distinct
advantages of mixed-precision truncation in SC designs.

Abstract: Population synthesis is a critical task that involves generating synthetic
yet realistic representations of populations. It is a fundamental problem in
agent-based modeling (ABM), which has become the standard to analyze
intelligent transportation systems. The synthetic population serves as the
primary input for ABM transportation simulation, with traveling agents
represented by population members. However, when the number of attributes
describing agents becomes large, survey data often cannot densely support the
joint distribution of the attributes in the population due to the curse of
dimensionality. This sparsity makes it difficult to accurately model and
produce the population. Interestingly, deep generative models trained from
available sample data can potentially synthesize possible attribute
combinations that present in the actual population but do not exist in the
sample data(called sampling zeros). Nevertheless, this comes at the cost of
falsely generating the infeasible attribute combinations that do not exist in
the population (called structural zeros). In this study, a novel diffusion
model-based population synthesis method is proposed to estimate the underlying
joint distribution of a population. This approach enables the recovery of
numerous missing sampling zeros while keeping the generated structural zeros
minimal. Our method is compared with other recently proposed approaches such as
Variational Autoencoders (VAE) and Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)
approaches, which have shown success in high dimensional tabular population
synthesis. We assess the performance of the synthesized outputs using a range
of metrics, including marginal distribution similarity, feasibility, and
diversity. The results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms
previous approaches in achieving a better balance between the feasibility and
diversity of the synthesized population.

Conclusion: PatchECG在多种布局下表现稳定且优于现有方法，为ECG分析提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Electrocardiogram (ECG) as an important tool for diagnosing cardiovascular
diseases such as arrhythmia. Due to the differences in ECG layouts used by
different hospitals, the digitized signals exhibit asynchronous lead time and
partial blackout loss, which poses a serious challenge to existing models. To
address this challenge, the study introduced PatchECG, a framework for adaptive
variable block count missing representation learning based on a masking
training strategy, which automatically focuses on key patches with
collaborative dependencies between leads, thereby achieving key recognition of
arrhythmia in ECGs with different layouts. Experiments were conducted on the
PTB-XL dataset and 21388 asynchronous ECG images generated using ECG image kit
tool, using the 23 Subclasses as labels. The proposed method demonstrated
strong robustness under different layouts, with average Area Under the Receiver
Operating Characteristic Curve (AUROC) of 0.835 and remained stable (unchanged
with layout changes). In external validation based on 400 real ECG images data
from Chaoyang Hospital, the AUROC for atrial fibrillation diagnosis reached
0.778; On 12 x 1 layout ECGs, AUROC reaches 0.893. This result is superior to
various classic interpolation and baseline methods, and compared to the current

Conclusion: FedMP有效提升了非独立同分布场景下的联邦学习性能，并分析了流形维度、通信效率和隐私影响。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) is a decentralized machine learning paradigm in which
multiple clients collaboratively train a shared model without sharing their
local private data. However, real-world applications of FL frequently encounter
challenges arising from the non-identically and independently distributed
(non-IID) local datasets across participating clients, which is particularly
pronounced in the field of medical imaging, where shifts in image feature
distributions significantly hinder the global model's convergence and
performance. To address this challenge, we propose FedMP, a novel method
designed to enhance FL under non-IID scenarios. FedMP employs stochastic
feature manifold completion to enrich the training space of individual client
classifiers, and leverages class-prototypes to guide the alignment of feature
manifolds across clients within semantically consistent subspaces, facilitating
the construction of more distinct decision boundaries. We validate the
effectiveness of FedMP on multiple medical imaging datasets, including those
with real-world multi-center distributions, as well as on a multi-domain
natural image dataset. The experimental results demonstrate that FedMP
outperforms existing FL algorithms. Additionally, we analyze the impact of
manifold dimensionality, communication efficiency, and privacy implications of
feature exposure in our method.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种动态量化训练（DQT）框架，通过嵌套整数表示和整数运算，实现了高效动态量化，避免了传统方法的性能瓶颈。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有动态量化方法需要昂贵的浮点运算切换精度，破坏了整数硬件范式并影响性能。

Method: DQT采用嵌套整数表示和自定义整数运算，通过低成本位移操作实现动态精度切换。

Result: 在ImageNet上，4位动态ResNet50达到77.00% top-1准确率，优于静态和动态方法。

Conclusion: DQT以极低成本实现了高效动态量化，为自适应AI开辟了新方向。

Abstract: The deployment of deep neural networks on resource-constrained devices relies
on quantization. While static, uniform quantization applies a fixed bit-width
to all inputs, it fails to adapt to their varying complexity. Dynamic,
instance-based mixed-precision quantization promises a superior
accuracy-efficiency trade-off by allocating higher precision only when needed.
However, a critical bottleneck remains: existing methods require a costly
dequantize-to-float and requantize-to-integer cycle to change precision,
breaking the integer-only hardware paradigm and compromising performance gains.
This paper introduces Dynamic Quantization Training (DQT), a novel framework
that removes this bottleneck. At the core of DQT is a nested integer
representation where lower-precision values are bit-wise embedded within
higher-precision ones. This design, coupled with custom integer-only
arithmetic, allows for on-the-fly bit-width switching through a near-zero-cost
bit-shift operation. This makes DQT the first quantization framework to enable
both dequantization-free static mixed-precision of the backbone network, and
truly efficient dynamic, instance-based quantization through a lightweight
controller that decides at runtime how to quantize each layer. We demonstrate
DQT state-of-the-art performance on ResNet18 on CIFAR-10 and ResNet50 on
ImageNet. On ImageNet, our 4-bit dynamic ResNet50 achieves 77.00% top-1
accuracy, an improvement over leading static (LSQ, 76.70%) and dynamic (DQNET,
76.94%) methods at a comparable BitOPs budget. Crucially, DQT achieves this
with a bit-width transition cost of only 28.3M simple bit-shift operations, a
drastic improvement over the 56.6M costly Multiply-Accumulate (MAC)
floating-point operations required by previous dynamic approaches - unlocking a
new frontier in efficient, adaptive AI.

Conclusion: scAGC通过自适应图和对比学习，显著提升了单细胞聚类性能。

Abstract: Accurate cell type annotation is a crucial step in analyzing single-cell RNA
sequencing (scRNA-seq) data, which provides valuable insights into cellular
heterogeneity. However, due to the high dimensionality and prevalence of zero
elements in scRNA-seq data, traditional clustering methods face significant
statistical and computational challenges. While some advanced methods use graph
neural networks to model cell-cell relationships, they often depend on static
graph structures that are sensitive to noise and fail to capture the
long-tailed distribution inherent in single-cell populations.To address these
limitations, we propose scAGC, a single-cell clustering method that learns
adaptive cell graphs with contrastive guidance. Our approach optimizes feature
representations and cell graphs simultaneously in an end-to-end manner.
Specifically, we introduce a topology-adaptive graph autoencoder that leverages
a differentiable Gumbel-Softmax sampling strategy to dynamically refine the
graph structure during training. This adaptive mechanism mitigates the problem
of a long-tailed degree distribution by promoting a more balanced neighborhood
structure. To model the discrete, over-dispersed, and zero-inflated nature of
scRNA-seq data, we integrate a Zero-Inflated Negative Binomial (ZINB) loss for
robust feature reconstruction. Furthermore, a contrastive learning objective is
incorporated to regularize the graph learning process and prevent abrupt
changes in the graph topology, ensuring stability and enhancing convergence.
Comprehensive experiments on 9 real scRNA-seq datasets demonstrate that scAGC
consistently outperforms other state-of-the-art methods, yielding the best NMI
and ARI scores on 9 and 7 datasets, respectively.Our code is available at
Anonymous Github.

Result: 实验证明LCSFLA能有效缓解非独立同分布数据引起的性能下降，激励机制具有激励相容性和个体合理性。

Conclusion: LCSFLA为联邦学习中的客户端选择问题提供了高效且激励兼容的解决方案。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) provides a decentralized framework that enables
universal model training through collaborative efforts on mobile nodes, such as
smart vehicles in the Internet of Vehicles (IoV). Each smart vehicle acts as a
mobile client, contributing to the process without uploading local data. This
method leverages non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) training
data from different vehicles, influenced by various driving patterns and
environmental conditions, which can significantly impact model convergence and
accuracy. Although client selection can be a feasible solution for non-IID
issues, it faces challenges related to selection metrics. Traditional metrics
evaluate client data quality independently per round and require client
selection after all clients complete local training, leading to resource
wastage from unused training results. In the IoV context, where vehicles have
limited connectivity and computational resources, information asymmetry in
client selection risks clients submitting false information, potentially making
the selection ineffective. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel
Long-term Client-Selection Federated Learning based on Truthful Auction
(LCSFLA). This scheme maximizes social welfare with consideration of long-term
data quality using a new assessment mechanism and energy costs, and the advised
auction mechanism with a deposit requirement incentivizes client participation
and ensures information truthfulness. We theoretically prove the incentive
compatibility and individual rationality of the advised incentive mechanism.
Experimental results on various datasets, including those from IoV scenarios,
demonstrate its effectiveness in mitigating performance degradation caused by
non-IID data.

assessment. While traditional contact-based methods are reliable, they often
pose challenges in comfort and practicality, particularly for long-term
monitoring. This survey comprehensively examines contact-based and contactless
approaches, emphasizing recent advances in machine learning and deep learning
techniques applied to breath analysis. Contactless methods, including Wi-Fi
Channel State Information and acoustic sensing, are analyzed for their ability
to provide accurate, noninvasive respiratory monitoring. We explore a broad
range of applications, from single-user respiratory rate detection to
multi-user scenarios, user identification, and respiratory disease detection.
Furthermore, this survey details essential data preprocessing, feature
extraction, and classification techniques, offering comparative insights into
machine learning/deep learning models suited to each approach. Key challenges
like dataset scarcity, multi-user interference, and data privacy are also
discussed, along with emerging trends like Explainable AI, federated learning,
transfer learning, and hybrid modeling. By synthesizing current methodologies
and identifying open research directions, this survey offers a comprehensive
framework to guide future innovations in breath analysis, bridging advanced
technological capabilities with practical healthcare applications.

### [159] [Fine-Grained Safety Neurons with Training-Free Continual Projection to Reduce LLM Fine Tuning Risks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09190)
*Bing Han,Feifei Zhao,Dongcheng Zhao,Guobin Shen,Ping Wu,Yu Shi,Yi Zeng*

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种细粒度安全神经元（FGSN）方法，通过无训练持续投影技术减少微调LLM时的安全风险，平衡安全性与实用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 微调大型语言模型（LLM）可能破坏原有对齐机制并引入安全风险，现有后微调防御方法缺乏对安全层和细粒度神经元的综合考虑。

Method: 提出FGSN方法，结合安全层与神经元的多尺度交互，定位稀疏且精确的细粒度安全神经元，并通过投影技术提升模型安全性。

Result: 实验表明，该方法显著降低有害分数和攻击成功率，同时保持模型实用性。

Conclusion: FGSN通过任务特异性、多维异构安全神经元集群优化机制，实现了对未知安全问题的持续防御和泛化能力。

Abstract: Fine-tuning as service injects domain-specific knowledge into large language
models (LLMs), while challenging the original alignment mechanisms and
introducing safety risks. A series of defense strategies have been proposed for
the alignment, fine-tuning, and post-fine-tuning phases, where most
post-fine-tuning defenses rely on coarse-grained safety layer mapping. These
methods lack a comprehensive consideration of both safety layers and
fine-grained neurons, limiting their ability to efficiently balance safety and
utility. To address this, we propose the Fine-Grained Safety Neurons (FGSN)
with Training-Free Continual Projection method to reduce the fine-tuning safety
risks. FGSN inherently integrates the multi-scale interactions between safety
layers and neurons, localizing sparser and more precise fine-grained safety
neurons while minimizing interference with downstream task neurons. We then
project the safety neuron parameters onto safety directions, improving model
safety while aligning more closely with human preferences. Extensive
experiments across multiple fine-tuned LLM models demonstrate that our method
significantly reduce harmfulness scores and attack success rates with minimal
parameter modifications, while preserving the model's utility. Furthermore, by
introducing a task-specific, multi-dimensional heterogeneous safety neuron
cluster optimization mechanism, we achieve continual defense and generalization
capability against unforeseen emerging safety concerns.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: TokenCast是一个基于LLM的框架，通过语言符号表示实现上下文感知的时间序列预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 时间序列预测在多个关键领域（如能源、医疗和金融）中至关重要，但现有方法在整合历史数值序列与上下文特征（如非结构化文本数据）方面存在挑战。

Method: TokenCast使用离散分词器将连续数值序列转换为时间标记，并通过预训练的大型语言模型（LLM）将时间标记与上下文标记嵌入共享表示空间，最后通过监督微调预测未来时间标记。

Result: 在多个真实数据集上的实验表明，TokenCast具有高效性和通用性。

Conclusion: TokenCast通过语言符号表示和LLM的统一语义空间，显著提升了上下文感知时间序列预测的准确性。

Abstract: Time series forecasting plays a vital role in supporting decision-making
across a wide range of critical applications, including energy, healthcare, and
finance. Despite recent advances, forecasting accuracy remains limited due to
the challenge of integrating historical numerical sequences with contextual
features, which often comprise unstructured textual data. To address this
challenge, we propose TokenCast, an LLM-driven framework that leverages
language-based symbolic representations as a unified intermediary for
context-aware time series forecasting. Specifically, TokenCast employs a
discrete tokenizer to transform continuous numerical sequences into temporal
tokens, enabling structural alignment with language-based inputs. To bridge the
semantic gap between modalities, both temporal and contextual tokens are
embedded into a shared representation space via a pre-trained large language
model (LLM), further optimized with autoregressive generative objectives.
Building upon this unified semantic space, the aligned LLM is subsequently
fine-tuned in a supervised manner to predict future temporal tokens, which are
then decoded back into the original numerical space. Extensive experiments on
diverse real-world datasets enriched with contextual features demonstrate the
effectiveness and generalizability of TokenCast.

*Xu Wang,Chenkai Xu,Yijie Jin,Jiachun Jin,Hao Zhang,Zhijie Deng*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为离散扩散强迫（D2F）的策略，通过结合自回归和扩散模型的优势，显著提升了扩散大语言模型（dLLMs）的推理速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的开源dLLMs在推理速度上未能超越类似规模的自回归（AR）LLMs，本文旨在打破这一限制。

Method: D2F通过块级自回归生成和跨块并行解码，将dLLMs改造为AR-扩散混合范式，并采用非对称蒸馏和流水线并行解码算法。

Result: 实验表明，D2F dLLMs在GSM8K上的推理速度比LLaMA3和Qwen2.5快2.5倍以上，比LLaDA和Dream等vanilla dLLMs快50倍以上，同时保持输出质量。

Conclusion: D2F是一种简单有效的策略，显著提升了dLLMs的推理效率，为文本生成提供了新的高效范式。

Abstract: Diffusion Large Language Models (dLLMs) have emerged as a promising
alternative to autoregressive (AR) LLMs for text generation, with the potential
to decode multiple tokens in a single iteration. However, none of the existing
open-source dLLMs have achieved superior inference speed over AR LLMs of
similar size. This paper breaks this barrier based on a simple and effective
strategy named discrete diffusion forcing (D2F). D2F equips dLLMs with two key
capabilities: (1) block-wise autoregressive generation to enable KV cache
utilization; (2) prediction of following tokens without requiring completion of
prior blocks for inter-block parallel decoding. In this way, the vanilla dLLMs
are refurbished into an AR-diffusion hybrid paradigm for efficient inference.
D2F can be implemented with an asymmetric distillation process based on
pre-trained dLLMs. We further propose a pipelined parallel decoding algorithm,
which enables a trade-off between efficiency and efficacy. Empirically, D2F
dLLMs achieve more than $\mathbf{2.5\times}$ inference speed than LLaMA3 and
Qwen2.5 on GSM8K. Compared to vanilla dLLMs like LLaDA and Dream, the
acceleration can be more than $\mathbf{50\times}$ while maintaining comparable
output quality. The code is available at

Method: 提出MIPCGRL，结合句子嵌入作为条件，通过多标签分类和多头回归网络训练多目标嵌入空间。

Result: 实验显示，MIPCGRL在多目标指令下的可控性提升了13.8%。

Conclusion: MIPCGRL能够处理复杂指令，实现更具表达力和灵活性的内容生成。

Abstract: Recent advancements in generative modeling emphasize the importance of
natural language as a highly expressive and accessible modality for controlling
content generation. However, existing instructed reinforcement learning for
procedural content generation (IPCGRL) method often struggle to leverage the
expressive richness of textual input, especially under complex, multi-objective
instructions, leading to limited controllability. To address this problem, we
propose \textit{MIPCGRL}, a multi-objective representation learning method for
instructed content generators, which incorporates sentence embeddings as
conditions. MIPCGRL effectively trains a multi-objective embedding space by
incorporating multi-label classification and multi-head regression networks.
Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves up to a 13.8\%
improvement in controllability with multi-objective instructions. The ability
to process complex instructions enables more expressive and flexible content
generation.

Abstract: The deployment of large-scale models, such as large language models (LLMs),
incurs substantial costs due to their computational demands. To mitigate these
costs and address challenges related to scalability and data security, there is
a growing shift towards decentralized systems for model deployment, where
choosing efficient inference acceleration schemes become crucial to manage
computational resources effectively and enhance system responsiveness. In this
work, we address the challenge of selecting optimal acceleration methods in
decentralized systems by introducing a meta-learning-based framework. This
framework automates the selection process by learning from historical
performance data of various acceleration techniques across different tasks.
Unlike traditional methods that rely on random selection or expert intuition,
our approach systematically identifies the best acceleration strategies based
on the specific characteristics of each task. We demonstrate that our
meta-learning framework not only streamlines the decision-making process but
also consistently outperforms conventional methods in terms of efficiency and
performance. Our results highlight the potential of inference acceleration in
decentralized AI systems, offering a path towards more democratic and
economically feasible artificial intelligence solutions.

Motivation: 现有优惠券分发策略未能充分利用平台与用户之间的复杂序列交互，导致性能瓶颈。

Method: 提出ADT4Coupons框架，整合通用场景、序列建模和高效迭代更新，直接制定长期收入提升的优惠券分发策略。

Result: 在真实工业数据集、公共数据集和合成数据集上的实证结果验证了框架的优越性。

Conclusion: ADT4Coupons能够有效优化在线决策，适用于多种实际营销场景。

Abstract: Coupon distribution is a critical marketing strategy used by online platforms
to boost revenue and enhance user engagement. Regrettably, existing coupon
distribution strategies fall far short of effectively leveraging the complex
sequential interactions between platforms and users. This critical oversight,
despite the abundance of e-commerce log data, has precipitated a performance
plateau. In this paper, we focus on the scene that the platforms make
sequential coupon distribution decision multiple times for various users, with
each user interacting with the platform repeatedly. Based on this marketing
scenario, we propose a novel marketing framework, named Aligned Decision
Transformer for Coupons (ADT4Coupons), to directly devise coupon distribution
policy for long-term revenue boosting. ADT4Coupons enables optimized online
decision-making in a variety of real-world marketing scenarios. It achieves
this by seamlessly integrating three key characteristics, general scenarios,
sequential modeling with more comprehensive historical data, and efficient
iterative updates within a unified framework. Furthermore, empirical results on
real-world industrial dataset, alongside public and synthetic datasets
demonstrate the superiority of our framework.

multi-level dataset that encompasses incidents, inspections, and violations
recorded sourced from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA).
This dataset uniquely integrates structured attributes with unstructured
narratives, facilitating a wide range of approaches driven by machine learning
and large language models. We also conduct a preliminary approach benchmarking
and various cross-level analyses using our dataset, offering insights to inform
and enhance future efforts in construction safety. For example, we found that
complaint-driven inspections were associated with a 17.3% reduction in the
likelihood of subsequent incidents. Our dataset and code are released at

Conclusion: MoQE通过动态路由和专家模型结合，有效缓解了量化模型的性能下降问题，同时保持了高效的推理性能。

Abstract: Quantization method plays a crucial role in improving model efficiency and
reducing deployment costs, enabling the widespread application of deep learning
models on resource-constrained devices. However, the quantization process
inevitably introduces accuracy degradation. In this paper, we propose Mixture
of Quantization Experts( abbr. MoQE), a quantization inference framework based
on the Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture, aiming to jointly improve the
performance of quantization models. MoQE combines multiple quantization
variants of one full-precision model as specialized "quantization experts" and
dynamically routes input data to the most suitable expert based on its
characteristics. MoQE alleviates the performance degradation commonly seen in
single quantization models through specialization quantization expert models.
We design lightweight, structure-aware router models tailored for both CV and
NLP tasks. Experimental evaluations on ResNet, LLaMA, and Qwen model families
across benchmark datasets including ImageNet, WikiText, C4, and OpenWebText
demonstrate that MoQE achieves performance comparable to SOTA quantization
model, without incurring significant increases in inference latency.

Conclusion: 该方法为AR/VR和下一代显示器制造中的微LED修复提供了高效且灵活的解决方案。

Abstract: Laser-enabled selective transfer, a key process in high-throughput microLED
fabrication, requires computational models that can plan shift sequences to
minimize motion of XY stages and adapt to varying optimization objectives
across the substrate. We propose the first repair algorithm based on a
differentiable transfer module designed to model discrete shifts of transfer
platforms, while remaining trainable via gradient-based optimization. Compared
to local proximity searching algorithms, our approach achieves superior repair
performance and enables more flexible objective designs, such as minimizing the
number of steps. Unlike reinforcement learning (RL)-based approaches, our
method eliminates the need for handcrafted feature extractors and trains
significantly faster, allowing scalability to large arrays. Experiments show a
50% reduction in transfer steps and sub-2-minute planning time on 2000x2000
arrays. This method provides a practical and adaptable solution for

Conclusion: Hi-Vec通过分层动态适应机制，显著提升了测试时适应能力，适用于复杂分布变化场景。

Abstract: Test-time adaptation allows pretrained models to adjust to incoming data
streams, addressing distribution shifts between source and target domains.
However, standard methods rely on single-dimensional linear classification
layers, which often fail to handle diverse and complex shifts. We propose
Hierarchical Adaptive Networks with Task Vectors (Hi-Vec), which leverages
multiple layers of increasing size for dynamic test-time adaptation. By
decomposing the encoder's representation space into such hierarchically
organized layers, Hi-Vec, in a plug-and-play manner, allows existing methods to
adapt to shifts of varying complexity. Our contributions are threefold: First,
we propose dynamic layer selection for automatic identification of the optimal
layer for adaptation to each test batch. Second, we propose a mechanism that
merges weights from the dynamic layer to other layers, ensuring all layers
receive target information. Third, we propose linear layer agreement that acts
as a gating function, preventing erroneous fine-tuning by adaptation on noisy
batches. We rigorously evaluate the performance of Hi-Vec in challenging
scenarios and on multiple target datasets, proving its strong capability to
advance state-of-the-art methods. Our results show that Hi-Vec improves
robustness, addresses uncertainty, and handles limited batch sizes and
increased outlier rates.

Abstract: Accurate trajectory prediction for buses is crucial in intelligent
transportation systems, particularly within urban environments. In developing
regions where access to multimodal data is limited, relying solely on onboard
GPS data remains indispensable despite inherent challenges. To address this
problem, we propose GSMT, a hybrid model that integrates a Graph Attention
Network (GAT) with a sequence-to-sequence Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), and
incorporates a task corrector capable of extracting complex behavioral patterns
from large-scale trajectory data. The task corrector clusters historical
trajectories to identify distinct motion patterns and fine-tunes the
predictions generated by the GAT and RNN. Specifically, GSMT fuses dynamic bus
information and static station information through embedded hybrid networks to
perform trajectory prediction, and applies the task corrector for secondary
refinement after the initial predictions are generated. This two-stage approach
enables multi-node trajectory prediction among buses operating in dense urban
traffic environments under complex conditions. Experiments conducted on a
real-world dataset from Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, demonstrate that our method
significantly outperforms existing approaches, achieving superior performance
in both short-term and long-term trajectory prediction tasks.

Abstract: Recent breakthroughs in large language models (LLMs) have opened the door to
in-depth investigation of their potential in tabular data modeling. However,
effectively utilizing advanced LLMs in few-shot and even zero-shot scenarios is
still challenging. To this end, we propose a novel LLM-based prototype
estimation framework for tabular learning. Our key idea is to query the LLM to
generate feature values based example-free prompt, which solely relies on task
and feature descriptions. With the feature values generated by LLM, we can
build a zero-shot prototype in a training-free manner, which can be further
enhanced by fusing few-shot samples, avoiding training a classifier or
finetuning the LLMs. Thanks to the example-free prompt and prototype
estimation, ours bypasses the constraints brought by the example-based prompt,
providing a scalable and robust framework. Extensive experiments demonstrate
the effectiveness of ours in zero and few-shot tabular learning.

Abstract: Odor detection underpins food safety, environmental monitoring, medical
diagnostics, and many more fields. The current artificial sensors developed for
odor detection struggle with complex mixtures while non-invasive recordings
lack reliable single-trial fidelity. To develop a general system for odor
detection, in this study we present a preliminary work where we aim to test two
hypotheses: (i) that spectral features of local field potentials (LFPs) are
sufficient for robust single-trial odor detection and (ii) that signals from
the olfactory bulb alone are adequate. To test two hypotheses, we propose an
ensemble of complementary one-dimensional convolutional networks (ResCNN and
AttentionCNN) that decodes the presence of odor from multichannel olfactory
bulb LFPs. Tested on 2,349 trials from seven awake mice, our final ensemble
model supports both hypotheses, achieving a mean accuracy of 86.6%, an F1-score
of 81.0%, and an AUC of 0.9247, substantially outperforming previous
benchmarks. In addition, the t-SNE visualization confirms that our framework
captures biologically significant signatures. These findings establish the
feasibility of robust single-trial detection of the presence of odor from
extracellular LFPs, as well as demonstrate the potential of deep learning
models to provide a deeper understanding of olfactory representations.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种评估图神经网络中信息过度压缩（over-squashing）的方法，并通过实验验证了重连（rewiring）技术在不同数据集上的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 图神经网络（GNNs）在长距离信息传递中存在信息过度压缩的问题，限制了其表达能力。现有重连技术缺乏直接的评估指标，因此需要一种量化方法来衡量其实际效果。

Method: 提出了一种基于拓扑结构的方法，通过节点对的互敏感性衰减率评估信息过度压缩，并扩展到四种图级统计量。结合因果设计，量化了重连技术对信息过度压缩的影响。

Result: 实验表明，图分类数据集普遍存在信息过度压缩，重连技术能有效缓解，但效果因数据集和方法而异；节点分类数据集的信息过度压缩不明显，重连可能增加问题。

Conclusion: 重连技术对信息过度压缩显著的数据集最有效，但需适度使用；过度重连或应用于问题不明显的图可能适得其反。论文提供了诊断工具帮助实践者决策。

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) have exhibited state-of-the-art performance
across wide-range of domains such as recommender systems, material design, and
drug repurposing. Yet message-passing GNNs suffer from over-squashing --
exponential compression of long-range information from distant nodes -- which
limits expressivity. Rewiring techniques can ease this bottleneck; but their
practical impacts are unclear due to the lack of a direct empirical
over-squashing metric. We propose a rigorous, topology-focused method for
assessing over-squashing between node pairs using the decay rate of their
mutual sensitivity. We then extend these pairwise assessments to four
graph-level statistics (prevalence, intensity, variability, extremity).
Coupling these metrics with a within-graph causal design, we quantify how
rewiring strategies affect over-squashing on diverse graph- and
node-classification benchmarks. Our extensive empirical analyses show that most
graph classification datasets suffer from over-squashing (but to various
extents), and rewiring effectively mitigates it -- though the degree of
mitigation, and its translation into performance gains, varies by dataset and
method. We also found that over-squashing is less notable in node
classification datasets, where rewiring often increases over-squashing, and
performance variations are uncorrelated with over-squashing changes. These
findings suggest that rewiring is most beneficial when over-squashing is both
substantial and corrected with restraint -- while overly aggressive rewiring,
or rewiring applied to minimally over-squashed graphs, is unlikely to help and
may even harm performance. Our plug-and-play diagnostic tool lets practitioners
decide -- before any training -- whether rewiring is likely to pay off.

TL;DR: 论文研究了协作多智能体强化学习（c-MARL）在现实约束条件下对对抗攻击的脆弱性，提出了一种高效的对抗扰动生成算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨c-MARL在现实场景中的脆弱性，弥补现有研究对训练时攻击或不现实条件的局限性。

Method: 在仅能收集和扰动部署智能体观测的约束条件下，设计简单高效的对抗扰动算法。

Result: 在三个基准和22个环境中验证了算法的有效性，且仅需1,000样本，远优于先前方法。

Conclusion: 提出的算法在现实约束下高效且通用，为c-MARL的安全性提供了新见解。

Abstract: Collaborative multi-agent reinforcement learning (c-MARL) has rapidly
evolved, offering state-of-the-art algorithms for real-world applications,
including sensitive domains. However, a key challenge to its widespread
adoption is the lack of a thorough investigation into its vulnerabilities to
adversarial attacks. Existing work predominantly focuses on training-time
attacks or unrealistic scenarios, such as access to policy weights or the
ability to train surrogate policies. In this paper, we investigate new
vulnerabilities under more realistic and constrained conditions, assuming an
adversary can only collect and perturb the observations of deployed agents. We
also consider scenarios where the adversary has no access at all. We propose
simple yet highly effective algorithms for generating adversarial perturbations
designed to misalign how victim agents perceive their environment. Our approach
is empirically validated on three benchmarks and 22 environments, demonstrating
its effectiveness across diverse algorithms and environments. Furthermore, we
show that our algorithm is sample-efficient, requiring only 1,000 samples
compared to the millions needed by previous methods.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于模式的知识组件（KC）自动发现框架，通过变分自编码器和注意力机制提取学生代码中的关键模式，显著提升了知识追踪的预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 计算机科学教育中的个性化学习需要准确建模学生的知识掌握情况，但现有方法在解释性和处理编程问题的开放性方面存在不足。

Method: 使用变分自编码器和注意力模型提取学生代码中的关键模式，并通过聚类形成模式化知识组件（KCs）。

Result: 实验表明，该方法能生成有意义的学习轨迹，并在深度知识追踪（DKT）中显著优于传统方法。

Conclusion: 该框架为计算机科学教育中的知识建模提供了自动化、可扩展且可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: Effective personalized learning in computer science education depends on
accurately modeling what students know and what they need to learn. While
Knowledge Components (KCs) provide a foundation for such modeling, automated KC
extraction from student code is inherently challenging due to insufficient
explainability of discovered KCs and the open-endedness of programming problems
with significant structural variability across student solutions and complex
interactions among programming concepts. In this work, we propose a novel,
explainable framework for automated KC discovery through pattern-based KCs:
recurring structural patterns within student code that capture the specific
programming patterns and language constructs that students must master. Toward
this, we train a Variational Autoencoder to generate important representative
patterns from student code guided by an explainable, attention-based code
representation model that identifies important correct and incorrect pattern
implementations from student code. These patterns are then clustered to form
pattern-based KCs. We evaluate our KCs using two well-established methods
informed by Cognitive Science: learning curve analysis and Deep Knowledge
Tracing (DKT). Experimental results demonstrate meaningful learning
trajectories and significant improvements in DKT predictive performance over
traditional KT methods. This work advances knowledge modeling in CS education
by providing an automated, scalable, and explainable framework for identifying
granular code patterns and algorithmic constructs, essential for student
learning.

Conclusion: 数据集蒸馏不仅能高效压缩任务数据，还能实现不同学习模态之间的转换，为跨领域学习提供了新思路。

Abstract: Dataset distillation compresses a large dataset into a small synthetic
dataset such that learning on the synthetic dataset approximates learning on
the original. Training on the distilled dataset can be performed in as little
as one step of gradient descent. We demonstrate that distillation is
generalizable to different tasks by distilling reinforcement learning
environments into one-batch supervised learning datasets. This demonstrates not
only distillation's ability to compress a reinforcement learning task but also
its ability to transform one learning modality (reinforcement learning) into
another (supervised learning). We present a novel extension of proximal policy
optimization for meta-learning and use it in distillation of a
multi-dimensional extension of the classic cart-pole problem, all MuJoCo
environments, and several Atari games. We demonstrate distillation's ability to
compress complex RL environments into one-step supervised learning, explore RL
distillation's generalizability across learner architectures, and demonstrate
distilling an environment into the smallest-possible synthetic dataset.

Abstract: Weather forecasting plays a vital role in disaster preparedness, agriculture,
and resource management, yet current centralized forecasting systems are
increasingly strained by security vulnerabilities, limited scalability, and
susceptibility to single points of failure. To address these challenges, we
propose a decentralized weather forecasting framework that integrates Federated
Learning (FL) with blockchain technology. FL enables collaborative model
training without exposing sensitive local data; this approach enhances privacy
and reduces data transfer overhead. Meanwhile, the Ethereum blockchain ensures
transparent and dependable verification of model updates. To further enhance
the system's security, we introduce a reputation-based voting mechanism that
assesses the trustworthiness of submitted models while utilizing the
Interplanetary File System (IPFS) for efficient off-chain storage. Experimental
results demonstrate that our approach not only improves forecasting accuracy
but also enhances system resilience and scalability, making it a viable
candidate for deployment in real-world, security-critical environments.

Motivation: GNNs在高风险应用中易受对抗攻击，现有方法对常用聚合函数的支持不足，需要一种更全面的验证方法。

Result: 在Cora、CiteSeer、Amazon和Yelp数据集上验证了GNNev的有效性和性能优势。

Conclusion: GNNev为GNNs提供了对抗鲁棒性保证，支持多种聚合函数，性能优于现有工具。

Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) are increasingly employed in high-stakes
applications, such as fraud detection or healthcare, but are susceptible to
adversarial attacks. A number of techniques have been proposed to provide
adversarial robustness guarantees, but support for commonly used aggregation
functions in message-passing GNNs is still lacking. In this paper, we develop
an exact (sound and complete) verification method for GNNs to compute
guarantees against attribute and structural perturbations that involve edge
addition or deletion, subject to budget constraints. Focusing on node
classification tasks, our method employs constraint solving with bound
tightening, and iteratively solves a sequence of relaxed constraint
satisfaction problems while relying on incremental solving capabilities of
solvers to improve efficiency. We implement GNNev, a versatile solver for
message-passing neural networks, which supports three aggregation functions,
sum, max and mean, with the latter two considered here for the first time.
Extensive experimental evaluation of GNNev on two standard benchmarks (Cora and
CiteSeer) and two real-world fraud datasets (Amazon and Yelp) demonstrates its
usability and effectiveness, as well as superior performance compared to
existing {exact verification} tools on sum-aggregated node classification
tasks.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于权重大小的突触修剪方法，模拟生物大脑的修剪机制，逐步移除低重要性连接，显著提升时间序列预测模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生物大脑通过突触修剪移除弱连接以提高效率，而人工神经网络中的dropout随机失活神经元，缺乏活动依赖性修剪。

Method: 提出一种基于权重大小的修剪方法，通过立方进度表逐步增加全局稀疏性，定期永久移除低重要性权重，同时保持梯度流动。

Result: 在多个时间序列预测模型和数据集上表现优异，显著降低平均绝对误差（金融预测中最高降低20%）。

Conclusion: 该方法将权重消除与渐进稀疏化结合，易于集成到不同架构中，是传统dropout技术的实用替代方案。

Abstract: Synaptic pruning in biological brains removes weak connections to improve
efficiency. In contrast, dropout regularization in artificial neural networks
randomly deactivates neurons without considering activity-dependent pruning. We
propose a magnitude-based synaptic pruning method that better reflects biology
by progressively removing low-importance connections during training.
Integrated directly into the training loop as a dropout replacement, our
approach computes weight importance from absolute magnitudes across layers and
applies a cubic schedule to gradually increase global sparsity. At fixed
intervals, pruning masks permanently remove low-importance weights while
maintaining gradient flow for active ones, eliminating the need for separate
pruning and fine-tuning phases. Experiments on multiple time series forecasting
models including RNN, LSTM, and Patch Time Series Transformer across four
datasets show consistent gains. Our method ranked best overall, with
statistically significant improvements confirmed by Friedman tests (p < 0.01).
In financial forecasting, it reduced Mean Absolute Error by up to 20% over
models with no or standard dropout, and up to 52% in select transformer models.
This dynamic pruning mechanism advances regularization by coupling weight
elimination with progressive sparsification, offering easy integration into
diverse architectures. Its strong performance, especially in financial time
series forecasting, highlights its potential as a practical alternative to
conventional dropout techniques.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 通过限制稀疏自编码器（SAEs）的训练范围到特定领域（如医学文本），可以提高重构保真度和可解释性，减少线性残差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统SAEs在广泛数据分布上训练，导致高频率、通用模式占主导，残差大且特征难以解释。

Method: 在医学文本领域训练JumpReLU SAEs，使用19.5万临床问答示例，专注于Gemma-2模型的第20层激活。

Result: 领域限制的SAEs解释方差提高20%，损失恢复更高，残差更小，特征与临床概念对齐。

Conclusion: 领域限制能改善SAEs的局限，提供更完整和可解释的潜在分解，质疑通用SAEs的扩展性。

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) decompose large language model (LLM) activations
into latent features that reveal mechanistic structure. Conventional SAEs train
on broad data distributions, forcing a fixed latent budget to capture only
high-frequency, generic patterns. This often results in significant linear
``dark matter'' in reconstruction error and produces latents that fragment or
absorb each other, complicating interpretation. We show that restricting SAE
training to a well-defined domain (medical text) reallocates capacity to
domain-specific features, improving both reconstruction fidelity and
interpretability. Training JumpReLU SAEs on layer-20 activations of Gemma-2
models using 195k clinical QA examples, we find that domain-confined SAEs
explain up to 20\% more variance, achieve higher loss recovery, and reduce
linear residual error compared to broad-domain SAEs. Automated and human
evaluations confirm that learned features align with clinically meaningful
concepts (e.g., ``taste sensations'' or ``infectious mononucleosis''), rather
than frequent but uninformative tokens. These domain-specific SAEs capture
relevant linear structure, leaving a smaller, more purely nonlinear residual.
We conclude that domain-confinement mitigates key limitations of broad-domain
SAEs, enabling more complete and interpretable latent decompositions, and
suggesting the field may need to question ``foundation-model'' scaling for
general-purpose SAEs.

Conclusion: 文本到图像模型能够有效对齐痴呆相关语音信息与生成图像，且生成图像可用于痴呆检测。

Abstract: Text-to-image models generate highly realistic images based on natural
language descriptions and millions of users use them to create and share images
online. While it is expected that such models can align input text and
generated image in the same latent space little has been done to understand
whether this alignment is possible between pathological speech and generated
images. In this work, we examine the ability of such models to align
dementia-related speech information with the generated images and develop
methods to explain this alignment. Surprisingly, we found that dementia
detection is possible from generated images alone achieving 75% accuracy on the
ADReSS dataset. We then leverage explainability methods to show which parts of
the language contribute to the detection.

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenges of data privacy and collaborative
modeling in cross-institution financial risk analysis. It proposes a risk
assessment framework based on federated learning. Without sharing raw data, the
method enables joint modeling and risk identification across multiple
institutions. This is achieved by incorporating a feature attention mechanism
and temporal modeling structure. Specifically, the model adopts a distributed
optimization strategy. Each financial institution trains a local sub-model. The
model parameters are protected using differential privacy and noise injection
before being uploaded. A central server then aggregates these parameters to
generate a global model. This global model is used for systemic risk
identification. To validate the effectiveness of the proposed method, multiple
experiments are conducted. These evaluate communication efficiency, model
accuracy, systemic risk detection, and cross-market generalization. The results
show that the proposed model outperforms both traditional centralized methods
and existing federated learning variants across all evaluation metrics. It
demonstrates strong modeling capabilities and practical value in sensitive
financial environments. The method enhances the scope and efficiency of risk
identification while preserving data sovereignty. It offers a secure and
efficient solution for intelligent financial risk analysis.

Abstract: This study proposes an unsupervised anomaly detection method for distributed
backend service systems, addressing practical challenges such as complex
structural dependencies, diverse behavioral evolution, and the absence of
labeled data. The method constructs a dynamic graph based on service invocation
relationships and applies graph convolution to extract high-order structural
representations from multi-hop topologies. A Transformer is used to model the
temporal behavior of each node, capturing long-term dependencies and local
fluctuations. During the feature fusion stage, a learnable joint embedding
mechanism integrates structural and behavioral representations into a unified
anomaly vector. A nonlinear mapping is then applied to compute anomaly scores,
enabling an end-to-end detection process without supervision. Experiments on
real-world cloud monitoring data include sensitivity analyses across different
graph depths, sequence lengths, and data perturbations. Results show that the
proposed method outperforms existing models on several key metrics,
demonstrating stronger expressiveness and stability in capturing anomaly
propagation paths and modeling dynamic behavior sequences, with high potential
for practical deployment.

Abstract: Many real-world interactions are group-based rather than pairwise such as
papers with multiple co-authors and users jointly engaging with items.
Hypergraph neural networks have shown great promise at modeling higher-order
relations, but their reliance on a fixed number of explicit message-passing
layers limits long-range dependency capture and can destabilize training as
depth grows. In this work, we introduce Implicit Hypergraph Neural Networks
(IHGNN), which bring the implicit equilibrium formulation to hypergraphs:
instead of stacking layers, IHGNN computes representations as the solution to a
nonlinear fixed-point equation, enabling stable and efficient global
propagation across hyperedges without deep architectures. We develop a
well-posed training scheme with provable convergence, analyze the oversmoothing
conditions and expressivity of the model, and derive a transductive
generalization bound on hypergraphs. We further present an implicit-gradient
training procedure coupled with a projection-based stabilization strategy.
Extensive experiments on citation benchmarks show that IHGNN consistently
outperforms strong traditional graph/hypergraph neural network baselines in
both accuracy and robustness. Empirically, IHGNN is resilient to random
initialization and hyperparameter variation, highlighting its strong
generalization and practical value for higher-order relational learning.

Result: 在洛杉矶地区195个传感器的六个月数据中，NEXICA在准确性和计算速度上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: NEXICA为交通拥堵源头识别提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Road traffic congestion is a persistent problem. Focusing resources on the
causes of congestion is a potentially efficient strategy for reducing
slowdowns. We present NEXICA, an algorithm to discover which parts of the
highway system tend to cause slowdowns on other parts of the highway. We use
time series of road speeds as inputs to our causal discovery algorithm. Finding
other algorithms inadequate, we develop a new approach that is novel in three
ways. First, it concentrates on just the presence or absence of events in the
time series, where an event indicates the temporal beginning of a traffic
slowdown. Second, we develop a probabilistic model using maximum likelihood
estimation to compute the probabilities of spontaneous and caused slowdowns
between two locations on the highway. Third, we train a binary classifier to
identify pairs of cause/effect locations trained on pairs of road locations
where we are reasonably certain a priori of their causal connections, both
positive and negative. We test our approach on six months of road speed data
from 195 different highway speed sensors in the Los Angeles area, showing that
our approach is superior to state-of-the-art baselines in both accuracy and
computation speed.

Motivation: 探索对比学习和生成方法在时间序列自监督学习中的互补潜力，解决各自局限性。

Method: 提出Contrastive Generative Time series框架（CoGenT），联合对比-生成优化。

Result: 在六个数据集上表现优异，F1分数分别比SimCLR和MAE提升59.2%和14.27%。

Conclusion: CoGenT为时间序列混合自监督学习奠定了基础，兼具判别力和生成鲁棒性。

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) for multivariate time series mainly includes
two paradigms: contrastive methods that excel at instance discrimination and
generative approaches that model data distributions. While effective
individually, their complementary potential remains unexplored. We propose a
Contrastive Generative Time series framework (CoGenT), the first framework to
unify these paradigms through joint contrastive-generative optimization. CoGenT
addresses fundamental limitations of both approaches: it overcomes contrastive
learning's sensitivity to high intra-class similarity in temporal data while
reducing generative methods' dependence on large datasets. We evaluate CoGenT
on six diverse time series datasets. The results show consistent improvements,
with up to 59.2% and 14.27% F1 gains over standalone SimCLR and MAE,
respectively. Our analysis reveals that the hybrid objective preserves
discriminative power while acquiring generative robustness. These findings
establish a foundation for hybrid SSL in temporal domains. We will release the
code shortly.

Result: 实验证明该方法性能优越。

Conclusion: FGCRN能有效分类已知健康状态并识别未知故障。

Abstract: A reliable fault diagnosis system should not only accurately classify known
health states but also effectively identify unknown faults. In multimode
processes, samples belonging to the same health state often show multiple
cluster distributions, making it difficult to construct compact and accurate
decision boundaries for that state. To address this challenge, a novel open-set
fault diagnosis model named fine-grained clustering and rejection network
(FGCRN) is proposed. It combines multiscale depthwise convolution,
bidirectional gated recurrent unit and temporal attention mechanism to capture
discriminative features. A distance-based loss function is designed to enhance
the intra-class compactness. Fine-grained feature representations are
constructed through unsupervised learning to uncover the intrinsic structures
of each health state. Extreme value theory is employed to model the distance
between sample features and their corresponding fine-grained representations,
enabling effective identification of unknown faults. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method.

restricting its real-world applicability. To address this, Meta Neural
Architecture Search (Meta-NAS) has emerged as a promising paradigm that
leverages prior knowledge across tasks to enable rapid adaptation to new ones.
Nevertheless, existing Meta-NAS methods often struggle with poor
generalization, limited search spaces, or high computational costs. In this
paper, we propose a novel Meta-NAS framework, GraB-NAS. Specifically, GraB-NAS
first models neural architectures as graphs, and then a hybrid search strategy
is developed to find and generate new graphs that lead to promising neural
architectures. The search strategy combines global architecture search via
Bayesian Optimization in the search space with local exploration for novel
neural networks via gradient ascent in the latent space. Such a hybrid search
strategy allows GraB-NAS to discover task-aware architectures with strong
performance, even beyond the predefined search space. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that GraB-NAS outperforms state-of-the-art Meta-NAS baselines,
achieving better generalization and search effectiveness.

Conclusion: DeepFeatIoT有望推动物联网数据分析的进步，并支持下一代智能系统的发展。

Abstract: Internet of Things (IoT) sensors are ubiquitous technologies deployed across
smart cities, industrial sites, and healthcare systems. They continuously
generate time series data that enable advanced analytics and automation in
industries. However, challenges such as the loss or ambiguity of sensor
metadata, heterogeneity in data sources, varying sampling frequencies,
inconsistent units of measurement, and irregular timestamps make raw IoT time
series data difficult to interpret, undermining the effectiveness of smart
systems. To address these challenges, we propose a novel deep learning model,
DeepFeatIoT, which integrates learned local and global features with
non-learned randomized convolutional kernel-based features and features from
large language models (LLMs). This straightforward yet unique fusion of diverse
learned and non-learned features significantly enhances IoT time series sensor
data classification, even in scenarios with limited labeled data. Our model's
effectiveness is demonstrated through its consistent and generalized
performance across multiple real-world IoT sensor datasets from diverse
critical application domains, outperforming state-of-the-art benchmark models.
These results highlight DeepFeatIoT's potential to drive significant
advancements in IoT analytics and support the development of next-generation
smart systems.

Result: 实验表明EGGS-PTP显著加速模型并节省内存，同时在多种LLM上保持更高准确性。

Conclusion: EGGS-PTP为高效部署大型语言模型提供了一种有效解决方案。

Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) become more widely adopted and scale up in
size, the computational and memory challenges involved in deploying these
massive foundation models have grown increasingly severe. This underscores the
urgent need to develop more efficient model variants. Faced with this
challenge, the present work introduces EGGS-PTP: an Expander-Graph Guided
Structured Post-training Pruning method. The proposed approach leverages graph
theory to guide the design of N:M structured pruning, effectively reducing
model size and computational demands. By incorporating concepts from expander
graphs, EGGS-PTP ensures information flow within the pruned network, preserving
essential model functionality. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate that
EGGS-PTP not only achieves significant acceleration and memory savings due to
structured sparsity but also outperforms existing structured pruning techniques
in terms of accuracy across various LLMs.

TL;DR: NeuronTune通过细粒度动态调控神经元，优化大型语言模型的安全性与实用性，显著优于现有技术。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法在安全性和实用性上存在不足，如对抗攻击鲁棒性差、频繁拒绝良性查询及性能下降。

Method: 提出NeuronTune框架，通过归因识别关键神经元，利用元学习动态调控，支持灵活调整干预范围。

Result: 实验表明，NeuronTune在安全性和实用性上均显著优于现有技术。

Conclusion: NeuronTune为LLM的安全部署提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Ensuring robust safety alignment while preserving utility is critical for the
reliable deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, current
techniques fundamentally suffer from intertwined deficiencies: insufficient
robustness against malicious attacks, frequent refusal of benign queries,
degradation in generated text quality and general task performance--the former
two reflecting deficits in robust safety and the latter constituting utility
impairment. We trace these limitations to the coarse-grained layer-wise
interventions in existing methods. To resolve this, we propose NeuronTune, a
fine-grained framework that dynamically modulates sparse neurons to achieve
simultaneous safety-utility optimization. Our approach first identifies
safety-critical and utility-preserving neurons across all layers via
attribution, then employs meta-learning to adaptively amplify safety-neuron
activations and suppress utility-neuron activations. Crucially, NeuronTune
enables tunable adjustment of intervention scope via neuron-count thresholds,
supporting flexible adaptation to security-critical or utility-priority
scenarios. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our method
significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art technologies, achieving
superior model safety while maintaining excellent utility.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基础模型在联邦持续学习环境中难以利用私有本地数据，且容易遗忘先前知识，而小模型则更适合资源受限的场景。

Method: 提出协作框架，结合小模型持续微调和一对一蒸馏技术，动态适应新任务并融合异构本地知识。

Result: 实验表明该框架在异构小模型环境下表现优异。

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了基础模型在联邦持续学习中的性能与遗忘问题。

Abstract: Continual learning (CL) for Foundation Models (FMs) is an essential yet
underexplored challenge, especially in Federated Continual Learning (FCL),
where each client learns from a private, evolving task stream under strict data
and communication constraints. Despite their powerful generalization abilities,
FMs often exhibit suboptimal performance on local downstream tasks, as they are
unable to utilize private local data. Furthermore, enabling FMs to learn new
tasks without forgetting prior knowledge is inherently a challenging problem,
primarily due to their immense parameter count and high model complexity. In
contrast, small models can be trained locally under resource-constrained
conditions and benefit from more mature CL techniques. To bridge the gap
between small models and FMs, we propose the first collaborative framework in
FCL, where lightweight local models act as a dynamic bridge, continually
adapting to new tasks while enhancing the utility of the large model. Two novel
components are also included: Small Model Continual Fine-tuning is for
preventing small models from temporal forgetting; One-by-One Distillation
performs personalized fusion of heterogeneous local knowledge on the server.
Experimental results demonstrate its superior performance, even when clients
utilize heterogeneous small models.

Conclusion: MiCo为边缘AI应用提供了一种高效、灵活的MPQ解决方案。

Abstract: Quantized Neural Networks (QNN) with extremely low-bitwidth data have proven
promising in efficient storage and computation on edge devices. To further
reduce the accuracy drop while increasing speedup, layer-wise mixed-precision
quantization (MPQ) becomes a popular solution. However, existing algorithms for
exploring MPQ schemes are limited in flexibility and efficiency. Comprehending
the complex impacts of different MPQ schemes on post-training quantization and
quantization-aware training results is a challenge for conventional methods.
Furthermore, an end-to-end framework for the optimization and deployment of MPQ
models is missing in existing work.
  In this paper, we propose the MiCo framework, a holistic MPQ exploration and
deployment framework for edge AI applications. The framework adopts a novel
optimization algorithm to search for optimal quantization schemes with the
highest accuracies while meeting latency constraints. Hardware-aware latency
models are built for different hardware targets to enable fast explorations.
After the exploration, the framework enables direct deployment from PyTorch MPQ
models to bare-metal C codes, leading to end-to-end speedup with minimal
accuracy drops.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于因果图的异常检测框架CGAD，用于公共基础设施系统中的网络攻击检测，解决了传统方法在分布偏移和类别不平衡问题上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着针对关键基础设施的网络攻击日益复杂，传统异常检测方法在多元时间序列中表现不佳，需要更鲁棒的策略。

Method: CGAD采用两阶段监督框架：因果分析和异常评分，利用动态贝叶斯网络学习因果不变图结构，并通过因果图比较检测异常。

Result: CGAD在非平稳和不平衡时间序列环境中表现优异，显著提高了检测精度，并在四个工业数据集上优于基线方法。

Conclusion: CGAD通过揭示传感器数据下的因果结构，重新定义了异常检测的鲁棒性，适用于复杂和延迟的异常检测。

Abstract: With the growing complexity of cyberattacks targeting critical
infrastructures such as water treatment networks, there is a pressing need for
robust anomaly detection strategies that account for both system
vulnerabilities and evolving attack patterns. Traditional methods --
statistical, density-based, and graph-based models struggle with distribution
shifts and class imbalance in multivariate time series, often leading to high
false positive rates. To address these challenges, we propose CGAD, a Causal
Graph-based Anomaly Detection framework designed for reliable cyberattack
detection in public infrastructure systems. CGAD follows a two-phase supervised
framework -- causal profiling and anomaly scoring. First, it learns causal
invariant graph structures representing the system's behavior under "Normal"
and "Attack" states using Dynamic Bayesian Networks. Second, it employs
structural divergence to detect anomalies via causal graph comparison by
evaluating topological deviations in causal graphs over time. By leveraging
causal structures, CGAD achieves superior adaptability and accuracy in
non-stationary and imbalanced time series environments compared to conventional
machine learning approaches. By uncovering causal structures beneath volatile
sensor data, our framework not only detects cyberattacks with markedly higher
precision but also redefines robustness in anomaly detection, proving
resilience where traditional models falter under imbalance and drift. Our
framework achieves substantial gains in F1 and ROC-AUC scores over
best-performing baselines across four industrial datasets, demonstrating robust
detection of delayed and structurally complex anomalies.

Motivation: 尽管大型语言模型（LLMs）取得了显著进展，但灾难性遗忘问题仍然是一个重大挑战。持续学习（CL）策略，尤其是基于回放的方法，为解决这一问题提供了潜在方案。

Method: Gauss-Tin方法结合了回放策略和高斯混合模型，优化训练中的样本选择质量，并通过教学指导辅助生成过去的学习内容。

Result: 实验结果表明，Gauss-Tin在保留指标上比传统方法提高了6%，显示出其在缓解灾难性遗忘方面的有效性。

Conclusion: 该研究强调了混合模型在提升LLMs在动态学习环境中的鲁棒性和适应性方面的潜力。

Abstract: Despite the significant advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs),
catastrophic forgetting remains a substantial challenge, where models lose
previously acquired knowledge upon learning new information. Continual learning
(CL) strategies have emerged as a potential solution to this problem, with
replay-based techniques demonstrating superior performance in preserving
learned knowledge. In this context, we introduce Gauss-Tin, a novel approach
that integrates the replay strategy with a Gaussian mixture model to enhance
the quality of sample selection during training, supplemented by instructional
guidance to facilitate the generation of past learning. This method aims to
improve LLMs' retention capabilities by strategically reinforcing important
past learnings while accommodating new information. Our experimental results
indicate a promising 6\% improvement in retention metrics over traditional
methods, suggesting that Gauss-Tin is an effective strategy for mitigating
catastrophic forgetting in LLMs. This study underscores the potential of hybrid
models in enhancing the robustness and adaptability of LLMs in dynamic learning
environments.

Result: 在五个基准测试中，模型表现出色，无需针对数据集调整即可实现高准确率。

Conclusion: 该框架为PBPM中的事件预测提供了鲁棒、通用且可解释的解决方案。

Abstract: Predictive Business Process Monitoring (PBPM) aims to forecast future events
in ongoing cases based on historical event logs. While Graph Neural Networks
(GNNs) are well suited to capture structural dependencies in process data,
existing GNN-based PBPM models remain underdeveloped. Most rely either on short
prefix subgraphs or global architectures that overlook temporal relevance and
transition semantics. We propose a unified, interpretable GNN framework that
advances the state of the art along three key axes. First, we compare
prefix-based Graph Convolutional Networks(GCNs) and full trace Graph Attention
Networks(GATs) to quantify the performance gap between localized and global
modeling. Second, we introduce a novel time decay attention mechanism that
constructs dynamic, prediction-centered windows, emphasizing temporally
relevant history and suppressing noise. Third, we embed transition type
semantics into edge features to enable fine grained reasoning over structurally
ambiguous traces. Our architecture includes multilevel interpretability
modules, offering diverse visualizations of attention behavior. Evaluated on
five benchmarks, the proposed models achieve competitive Top-k accuracy and DL
scores without per-dataset tuning. By addressing architectural, temporal, and
semantic gaps, this work presents a robust, generalizable, and explainable
solution for next event prediction in PBPM.

Result: 实验表明，该方法在延迟减少24%的同时，平均准确率提高2.5%。

Conclusion: 该框架在车联网场景中实现了最佳精度-效率权衡。

Abstract: Federated fine-tuning has emerged as a promising approach for adapting
foundation models (FMs) to diverse downstream tasks in edge environments. In
Internet of Vehicles (IoV) systems, enabling efficient and low-latency
multi-task adaptation is particularly challenging due to client mobility,
heterogeneous resources, and intermittent connectivity. This paper proposes a
hierarchical federated fine-tuning framework that coordinates roadside units
(RSUs) and vehicles to support resource-aware and mobility-resilient learning
across dynamic IoV scenarios. Leveraging Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), we
introduce a decentralized, energy-aware rank adaptation mechanism formulated as
a constrained multi-armed bandit problem. A novel UCB-DUAL algorithm is
developed to enable adaptive exploration under per-task energy budgets,
achieving provable sublinear regret. To evaluate our method, we construct a
large-scale IoV simulator based on real-world trajectories, capturing dynamic
participation, RSU handoffs, and communication variability. Extensive
experiments show that our approach achieves the best accuracy-efficiency
trade-off among all baselines, reducing latency by over 24\% and improving
average accuracy by more than 2.5\%.

Conclusion: SYNAPSE-G通过合成数据生成和标签传播有效解决了罕见事件分类的数据稀缺问题。

Abstract: Scarcity of labeled data, especially for rare events, hinders training
effective machine learning models. This paper proposes SYNAPSE-G (Synthetic
Augmentation for Positive Sampling via Expansion on Graphs), a novel pipeline
leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate synthetic training data for
rare event classification, addressing the cold-start problem. This synthetic
data serve as seeds for semi-supervised label propagation on a similarity graph
constructed between the seeds and a large unlabeled dataset. This identifies
candidate positive examples, subsequently labeled by an oracle (human or LLM).
The expanded dataset then trains/fine-tunes a classifier. We theoretically
analyze how the quality (validity and diversity) of the synthetic data impacts
the precision and recall of our method. Experiments on the imbalanced SST2 and
MHS datasets demonstrate SYNAPSE-G's effectiveness in finding positive labels,
outperforming baselines including nearest neighbor search.

Abstract: Edge General Intelligence (EGI) represents a transformative evolution of edge
computing, where distributed agents possess the capability to perceive, reason,
and act autonomously across diverse, dynamic environments. Central to this
vision are world models, which act as proactive internal simulators that not
only predict but also actively imagine future trajectories, reason under
uncertainty, and plan multi-step actions with foresight. This proactive nature
allows agents to anticipate potential outcomes and optimize decisions ahead of
real-world interactions. While prior works in robotics and gaming have
showcased the potential of world models, their integration into the wireless
edge for EGI remains underexplored. This survey bridges this gap by offering a
comprehensive analysis of how world models can empower agentic artificial
intelligence (AI) systems at the edge. We first examine the architectural
foundations of world models, including latent representation learning, dynamics
modeling, and imagination-based planning. Building on these core capabilities,
we illustrate their proactive applications across EGI scenarios such as
vehicular networks, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) networks, the Internet of
Things (IoT) systems, and network functions virtualization, thereby
highlighting how they can enhance optimization under latency, energy, and
privacy constraints. We then explore their synergy with foundation models and
digital twins, positioning world models as the cognitive backbone of EGI.
Finally, we highlight open challenges, such as safety guarantees, efficient
training, and constrained deployment, and outline future research directions.
This survey provides both a conceptual foundation and a practical roadmap for
realizing the next generation of intelligent, autonomous edge systems.

Result: 复杂度度量方法能给出实例依赖的最优误差界限，且在随机生成的PLS实例中高概率匹配。

Conclusion: PLS模型为有限选择性预测提供了理论框架，复杂度度量方法有效。

Abstract: Selective prediction [Dru13, QV19] models the scenario where a forecaster
freely decides on the prediction window that their forecast spans. Many data
statistics can be predicted to a non-trivial error rate without any
distributional assumptions or expert advice, yet these results rely on that the
forecaster may predict at any time. We introduce a model of Prediction with
Limited Selectivity (PLS) where the forecaster can start the prediction only on
a subset of the time horizon. We study the optimal prediction error both on an
instance-by-instance basis and via an average-case analysis. We introduce a
complexity measure that gives instance-dependent bounds on the optimal error.
For a randomly-generated PLS instance, these bounds match with high
probability.

Conclusion: GDCC框架通过因果容量测量和子目标发现，有效提升了强化学习中的探索效率。

Abstract: Causal inference is crucial for humans to explore the world, which can be
modeled to enable an agent to efficiently explore the environment in
reinforcement learning. Existing research indicates that establishing the
causality between action and state transition will enhance an agent to reason
how a policy affects its future trajectory, thereby promoting directed
exploration. However, it is challenging to measure the causality due to its
intractability in the vast state-action space of complex scenarios. In this
paper, we propose a novel Goal Discovery with Causal Capacity (GDCC) framework
for efficient environment exploration. Specifically, we first derive a
measurement of causality in state space, \emph{i.e.,} causal capacity, which
represents the highest influence of an agent's behavior on future trajectories.
After that, we present a Monte Carlo based method to identify critical points
in discrete state space and further optimize this method for continuous
high-dimensional environments. Those critical points are used to uncover where
the agent makes important decisions in the environment, which are then regarded
as our subgoals to guide the agent to make exploration more purposefully and
efficiently. Empirical results from multi-objective tasks demonstrate that
states with high causal capacity align with our expected subgoals, and our GDCC
achieves significant success rate improvements compared to baselines.

Abstract: Solving partial differential equations (PDEs) efficiently and accurately
remains a cornerstone challenge in science and engineering, especially for
problems involving complex geometries and limited labeled data. We introduce a
Physics- and Geometry- Aware Spatio-Spectral Graph Neural Operator
($\pi$G-Sp$^2$GNO) for learning the solution operators of time-independent and
time-dependent PDEs. The proposed approach first improves upon the recently
developed Sp$^2$GNO by enabling geometry awareness and subsequently exploits
the governing physics to learn the underlying solution operator in a
simulation-free setup. While the spatio-spectral structure present in the
proposed architecture allows multiscale learning, two separate strategies for
enabling geometry awareness is introduced in this paper. For time dependent
problems, we also introduce a novel hybrid physics informed loss function that
combines higher-order time-marching scheme with upscaled theory inspired
stochastic projection scheme. This allows accurate integration of the
physics-information into the loss function. The performance of the proposed
approach is illustrated on number of benchmark examples involving regular and
complex domains, variation in geometry during inference, and time-independent
and time-dependent problems. The results obtained illustrate the efficacy of
the proposed approach as compared to the state-of-the-art physics-informed
neural operator algorithms in the literature.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统时间序列模型忽略变量语义信息，而TimeMKG旨在利用变量名称和描述的丰富语义知识，提升建模的鲁棒性和可解释性。

Method: TimeMKG使用大型语言模型解析变量语义并构建多变量知识图谱，通过双模态编码器分别建模语义提示和统计模式，并通过跨模态注意力融合表示。

Result: 实验表明，引入变量级知识显著提升了预测性能和泛化能力。

Conclusion: TimeMKG通过融合语义和统计信息，为时间序列建模提供了更强大且可解释的框架。

Abstract: Multivariate time series data typically comprises two distinct modalities:
variable semantics and sampled numerical observations. Traditional time series
models treat variables as anonymous statistical signals, overlooking the rich
semantic information embedded in variable names and data descriptions. However,
these textual descriptors often encode critical domain knowledge that is
essential for robust and interpretable modeling. Here we present TimeMKG, a
multimodal causal reasoning framework that elevates time series modeling from
low-level signal processing to knowledge informed inference. TimeMKG employs
large language models to interpret variable semantics and constructs structured
Multivariate Knowledge Graphs that capture inter-variable relationships. A
dual-modality encoder separately models the semantic prompts, generated from
knowledge graph triplets, and the statistical patterns from historical time
series. Cross-modality attention aligns and fuses these representations at the
variable level, injecting causal priors into downstream tasks such as
forecasting and classification, providing explicit and interpretable priors to
guide model reasoning. The experiment in diverse datasets demonstrates that
incorporating variable-level knowledge significantly improves both predictive

### [205] [Thermal Tracks: A Gaussian process-based framework for universal melting curve analysis enabling unconstrained hit identification in thermal proteome profiling experiments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09659)
*Johannes F. Hevler,Shivam Verma,Mirat Soijtra,Carolyn R. Bertozzi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Thermal Tracks是一个基于Python的统计框架，用于分析蛋白质热稳定性数据，克服了现有热蛋白质组分析（TPP）方法的关键限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有TPP方法假设熔解曲线为S形，并受限于经验零分布，导致只能检测约5%的数据中的显著变化。Thermal Tracks旨在解决这一问题，提供更灵活和准确的统计方法。

Method: 使用高斯过程（GP）模型和平方指数核，灵活建模任何熔解曲线形状，并通过核先验生成无偏零分布。

Result: Thermal Tracks能够分析蛋白质组范围内的扰动（如通路抑制、遗传修饰或环境压力），并适用于具有非传统熔解曲线的蛋白质（如相分离蛋白和膜蛋白）。

Conclusion: Thermal Tracks是一个免费、灵活且易于使用的工具，为蛋白质组热稳定性研究提供了更强大的分析能力。

Abstract: Thermal Tracks is a Python-based statistical framework for analyzing protein
thermal stability data that overcomes key limitations of existing thermal
proteome profiling (TPP) work-flows. Unlike standard approaches that assume
sigmoidal melting curves and are constrained by empirical null distributions
(limiting significant hits to approximately 5 % of data), Thermal Tracks uses
Gaussian Process (GP) models with squared-exponential kernels to flexibly model
any melting curve shape while generating unbiased null distributions through
kernel priors. This framework is particularly valuable for analyzing
proteome-wide perturbations that significantly alter protein thermal stability,
such as pathway inhibitions, genetic modifications, or environmental stresses,
where conventional TPP methods may miss biologically relevant changes due to
their statistical constraints. Furthermore, Thermal Tracks excels at analyzing
proteins with un-conventional melting profiles, including phase-separating
proteins and membrane proteins, which often exhibit complex, non-sigmoidal
thermal stability behaviors. Thermal Tracks is freely available from GitHub and
is implemented in Python, providing an accessible and flexible tool for
proteome-wide thermal profiling studies.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文研究了非对称低秩矩阵补全问题，通过梯度下降法解决，发现无需正则化项也能保证收敛，并提出了一种线性收敛率的证明方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探讨梯度下降法中正则化项的必要性，并验证其是否影响收敛性能。

Method: 采用无正则化项的梯度下降法，结合谱初始化和留一法技术，证明线性收敛率。

Result: 实验和理论分析表明，无正则化项的梯度下降法具有线性收敛率，且计算成本更低。

Conclusion: 梯度下降法具有隐式正则化特性，无需显式正则化项即可高效收敛。

Abstract: This paper investigates the asymmetric low-rank matrix completion problem,
which can be formulated as an unconstrained non-convex optimization problem
with a nonlinear least-squares objective function, and is solved via gradient
descent methods. Previous gradient descent approaches typically incorporate
regularization terms into the objective function to guarantee convergence.
However, numerical experiments and theoretical analysis of the gradient flow
both demonstrate that the elimination of regularization terms in gradient
descent algorithms does not adversely affect convergence performance. By
introducing the leave-one-out technique, we inductively prove that the vanilla
gradient descent with spectral initialization achieves a linear convergence
rate with high probability. Besides, we demonstrate that the balancing
regularization term exhibits a small norm during iterations, which reveals the
implicit regularization property of gradient descent. Empirical results show
that our algorithm has a lower computational cost while maintaining comparable
completion performance compared to other gradient descent algorithms.

Method: 使用漂移映射和事件索引块的组合，结合仿射投影，并通过算子理论分析其收敛性和鲁棒性。

Result: 证明了变块收缩引理、漂移-投影收敛定理，以及嵌套仿射锚定下的本体收敛性。还提出了内部手稿计算机（MC）的严格等价定理。

Conclusion: 该框架为时间锚定提供了理论基础，并在注意力层中验证了其应用，展示了软最大函数的Lipschitz性质及层收缩条件。

Abstract: We develop an operator-theoretic framework for temporal anchoring in
embedding spaces, modeled as drift maps interleaved with event-indexed blocks
culminating in affine projections. We provide complete proofs for a
variable-block contraction lemma (products of Lipschitz factors), a
drift--projection convergence theorem with explicit uniform-gap envelopes, and
ontological convergence under nested affine anchors with a robustness variant.
We formalize an internal Manuscript Computer (MC) whose computations are
defined purely by these operators and prove a rigorous finite-run equivalence
theorem (with perturbation bounds). For attention layers, we give a
self-contained proof that softmax is $1/2$-Lipschitz in $\ell_2$ and derive
sufficient layer-contraction conditions (orthogonal/non-orthogonal heads). All
floats are placed exactly where written; the manuscript uses only in-paper
pseudocode and appendix figures.

Result: 在合成和真实噪声数据集上实验表明，DCM优于现有方法，并首次验证KANs作为分类器在噪声场景中的优越性。

Conclusion: DCM机制能有效提升模型对噪声标签的鲁棒性，且KANs在噪声场景中表现优于MLPs。

Abstract: Noisy labels are inevitable in real-world scenarios. Due to the strong
capacity of deep neural networks to memorize corrupted labels, these noisy
labels can cause significant performance degradation. Existing research on
mitigating the negative effects of noisy labels has mainly focused on robust
loss functions and sample selection, with comparatively limited exploration of
regularization in model architecture. Inspired by the sparsity regularization
used in Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs), we propose a Dynamic Connection
Masking (DCM) mechanism for both Multi-Layer Perceptron Networks (MLPs) and
KANs to enhance the robustness of classifiers against noisy labels. The
mechanism can adaptively mask less important edges during training by
evaluating their information-carrying capacity. Through theoretical analysis,
we demonstrate its efficiency in reducing gradient error. Our approach can be
seamlessly integrated into various noise-robust training methods to build more
robust deep networks, including robust loss functions, sample selection
strategies, and regularization techniques. Extensive experiments on both
synthetic and real-world benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) approaches. Furthermore, we are also the
first to investigate KANs as classifiers against noisy labels, revealing their
superior noise robustness over MLPs in real-world noisy scenarios. Our code
will soon be publicly available.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出GraphTreeGen（GTG），一种基于子树的生成框架，用于高效、准确地合成脑连接组，解决了现有模型在局部结构、节点属性、边权重预测和计算效率上的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 脑连接组对理解大脑组织至关重要，但获取成本高且耗时，因此需要生成方法。现有模型存在局部结构模糊、依赖节点属性、边权重预测不准确和计算效率低等问题。

Method: GTG将连接组分解为熵引导的k-hop子树，通过共享GCN编码局部结构，利用二分消息传递层融合子树嵌入和全局节点特征，双分支解码器联合预测边存在和权重。

Conclusion: GTG提供了一种高效、准确的脑连接组生成方法，其模块化设计支持扩展到超分辨率和跨模态合成。

Abstract: Brain connectomes, representing neural connectivity as graphs, are crucial
for understanding brain organization but costly and time-consuming to acquire,
motivating generative approaches. Recent advances in graph generative modeling
offer a data-driven alternative, enabling synthetic connectome generation and
reducing dependence on large neuroimaging datasets. However, current models
face key limitations: (i) compressing the whole graph into a single latent code
(e.g., VGAEs) blurs fine-grained local motifs; (ii) relying on rich node
attributes rarely available in connectomes reduces reconstruction quality;
(iii) edge-centric models emphasize topology but overlook accurate edge-weight
prediction, harming quantitative fidelity; and (iv) computationally expensive
designs (e.g., edge-conditioned convolutions) impose high memory demands,
limiting scalability. We propose GraphTreeGen (GTG), a subtree-centric
generative framework for efficient, accurate connectome synthesis. GTG
decomposes each connectome into entropy-guided k-hop trees capturing
informative local structure, encoded by a shared GCN. A bipartite
message-passing layer fuses subtree embeddings with global node features, while
a dual-branch decoder jointly predicts edge existence and weights to
reconstruct the adjacency matrix. GTG outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in
self-supervised tasks and remains competitive in supervised settings,
delivering higher structural fidelity and more precise weights with far less
memory. Its modular design enables extensions to connectome super-resolution
and cross-modality synthesis. Code: https://github.com/basiralab/GTG/

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种结合大型语言模型（LLM）处理临床笔记的方法，以改进概念瓶颈模型（CBM）在急性呼吸窘迫综合征（ARDS）识别中的性能，性能提升10%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型公开临床数据集虽有助于疾病异质性研究和个性化治疗，但数据不完整且缺乏关键标签。现有AI工具虽能标记数据，但解释性有限。CBM虽能提供可解释概念，但在任务解释不足时性能受限。

Method: 利用LLM处理临床笔记生成额外概念，结合CBM改进ARDS识别。

Result: 性能提升10%，学习到更全面的概念，减少信息泄漏和依赖虚假捷径。

Conclusion: 结合LLM的CBM方法能显著提升性能，改善ARDS的表征。

Abstract: Large, publicly available clinical datasets have emerged as a novel resource
for understanding disease heterogeneity and to explore personalization of
therapy. These datasets are derived from data not originally collected for
research purposes and, as a result, are often incomplete and lack critical
labels. Many AI tools have been developed to retrospectively label these
datasets, such as by performing disease classification; however, they often
suffer from limited interpretability. Previous work has attempted to explain
predictions using Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs), which learn interpretable
concepts that map to higher-level clinical ideas, facilitating human
evaluation. However, these models often experience performance limitations when
the concepts fail to adequately explain or characterize the task. We use the
identification of Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) as a challenging
test case to demonstrate the value of incorporating contextual information from
clinical notes to improve CBM performance. Our approach leverages a Large
Language Model (LLM) to process clinical notes and generate additional
concepts, resulting in a 10% performance gain over existing methods.
Additionally, it facilitates the learning of more comprehensive concepts,
thereby reducing the risk of information leakage and reliance on spurious
shortcuts, thus improving the characterization of ARDS.

Motivation: 现有方法单独评估创意元素，难以处理组合搜索空间大的问题。

Method: 两阶段架构：生成模型生成多样化创意组合，强化学习优化；多实例学习模型分配组合级奖励。

Result: 在电商平台部署后显著增加广告收入。

Conclusion: GenCO框架有效解决创意组合优化问题，并发布工业数据集促进研究。

Abstract: In e-commerce advertising, selecting the most compelling combination of
creative elements -- such as titles, images, and highlights -- is critical for
capturing user attention and driving conversions. However, existing methods
often evaluate creative components individually, failing to navigate the
exponentially large search space of possible combinations. To address this
challenge, we propose a novel framework named GenCO that integrates generative
modeling with multi-instance reward learning. Our unified two-stage
architecture first employs a generative model to efficiently produce a diverse
set of creative combinations. This generative process is optimized with
reinforcement learning, enabling the model to effectively explore and refine
its selections. Next, to overcome the challenge of sparse user feedback, a
multi-instance learning model attributes combination-level rewards, such as
clicks, to the individual creative elements. This allows the reward model to
provide a more accurate feedback signal, which in turn guides the generative
model toward creating more effective combinations. Deployed on a leading
e-commerce platform, our approach has significantly increased advertising
revenue, demonstrating its practical value. Additionally, we are releasing a
large-scale industrial dataset to facilitate further research in this important
domain.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Hereditary Knowledge Transfer (HKT)的方法，通过模块化和选择性特征转移优化小型可部署模型，性能优于传统蒸馏方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决深度神经网络因模型规模和复杂性增加而导致的部署困难问题，同时保持高性能。

Method: 受生物学启发，提出HKT框架，包含提取、转移和混合（ETM）三阶段特征转移，并引入遗传注意力（GA）机制。

Result: 在多种视觉任务中（如光流、图像分类、语义分割），HKT显著提升小型模型性能，同时保持紧凑性。

Conclusion: HKT为资源受限环境提供了一种通用、可解释且可扩展的高性能神经网络部署方案。

Abstract: A prevailing trend in neural network research suggests that model performance
improves with increasing depth and capacity - often at the cost of
integrability and efficiency. In this paper, we propose a strategy to optimize
small, deployable models by enhancing their capabilities through structured
knowledge inheritance. We introduce Hereditary Knowledge Transfer (HKT), a
biologically inspired framework for modular and selective transfer of
task-relevant features from a larger, pretrained parent network to a smaller
child model. Unlike standard knowledge distillation, which enforces uniform
imitation of teacher outputs, HKT draws inspiration from biological inheritance
mechanisms - such as memory RNA transfer in planarians - to guide a multi-stage
process of feature transfer. Neural network blocks are treated as functional
carriers, and knowledge is transmitted through three biologically motivated
components: Extraction, Transfer, and Mixture (ETM). A novel Genetic Attention
(GA) mechanism governs the integration of inherited and native representations,
ensuring both alignment and selectivity. We evaluate HKT across diverse vision
tasks, including optical flow (Sintel, KITTI), image classification (CIFAR-10),
and semantic segmentation (LiTS), demonstrating that it significantly improves
child model performance while preserving its compactness. The results show that
HKT consistently outperforms conventional distillation approaches, offering a
general-purpose, interpretable, and scalable solution for deploying
high-performance neural networks in resource-constrained environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预测个体的衰老轨迹是预防医学和生物信息学的核心挑战，但现有模型难以捕捉衰老的动态过程。

Method: 利用2019-2022年的纵向数据，设计捕捉生物标志物变化率的新特征，构建LightGBM模型。

Conclusion: 动态健康轨迹是预测生物年龄的关键，该框架为临床工具提供了基础，支持个性化干预。

Abstract: Predicting an individual's aging trajectory is a central challenge in
preventative medicine and bioinformatics. While machine learning models can
predict chronological age from biomarkers, they often fail to capture the
dynamic, longitudinal nature of the aging process. In this work, we developed
and validated a machine learning pipeline to predict age using a longitudinal
cohort with data from two distinct time periods (2019-2020 and 2021-2022). We
demonstrate that a model using only static, cross-sectional biomarkers has
limited predictive power when generalizing to future time points. However, by
engineering novel features that explicitly capture the rate of change (slope)
of key biomarkers over time, we significantly improved model performance. Our
final LightGBM model, trained on the initial wave of data, successfully
predicted age in the subsequent wave with high accuracy ($R^2 = 0.515$ for
males, $R^2 = 0.498$ for females), significantly outperforming both traditional
linear models and other tree-based ensembles. SHAP analysis of our successful
model revealed that the engineered slope features were among the most important
predictors, highlighting that an individual's health trajectory, not just their
static health snapshot, is a key determinant of biological age. Our framework
paves the way for clinical tools that dynamically track patient health
trajectories, enabling early intervention and personalized prevention
strategies for age-related diseases.

empirically validate our parameterization and further investigate how scaling
the number of experts and granularity affects the optimal learning rate.

Abstract: Electric load forecasting is pivotal for power system operation, planning and
decision-making. The rise of smart grids and meters has provided more detailed
and high-quality load data at multiple levels of granularity, from home to bus
and cities. Motivated by similar patterns of loads across different cities in a
province in eastern China, in this paper we focus on the Multi-Region Electric
Load Forecasting (MRELF) problem, targeting accurate short-term load
forecasting for multiple sub-regions within a large region. We identify three
challenges for MRELF, including regional variation, contextual variation, and
temporal variation. To address them, we propose TriForecaster, a new framework
leveraging the Mixture of Experts (MoE) approach within a Multi-Task Learning
(MTL) paradigm to overcome these challenges. TriForecaster features RegionMixer
and Context-Time Specializer (CTSpecializer) layers, enabling dynamic
cooperation and specialization of expert models across regional, contextual,
and temporal dimensions. Based on evaluation on four real-world MRELF datasets
with varied granularity, TriForecaster outperforms state-of-the-art models by
achieving an average forecast error reduction of 22.4\%, thereby demonstrating
its flexibility and broad applicability. In particular, the deployment of
TriForecaster on the eForecaster platform in eastern China exemplifies its
practical utility, effectively providing city-level, short-term load forecasts
for 17 cities, supporting a population exceeding 110 million and daily
electricity usage over 100 gigawatt-hours.

Conclusion: 该方法在准确性、速度和模型大小之间取得了优越的平衡，优于其他基准方法。

Abstract: We present Proto-PINV+H, a fast training paradigm that combines closed-form
weight computation with gradient-based optimisation of a small set of synthetic
inputs, soft labels, and-crucially-hidden activations. At each iteration we
recompute all weight matrices in closed form via two (or more)
ridge-regularised pseudo-inverse solves, while updating only the prototypes
with Adam. The trainable degrees of freedom are thus shifted from weight space
to data/activation space. On MNIST (60k train, 10k test) and Fashion-MNIST (60k
train, 10k test), our method reaches 97.8% and 89.3% test accuracy on the
official 10k test sets, respectively, in 3.9s--4.5s using approximately 130k
trainable parameters and only 250 epochs on an RTX 5060 (16GB). We provide a
multi-layer extension (optimised activations at each hidden stage), learnable
ridge parameters, optional PCA/PLS projections, and theory linking the
condition number of prototype matrices to generalisation. The approach yields
favourable accuracy--speed--size trade-offs against ELM, random-feature ridge,

Abstract: Biomechanical features have become important indicators for evaluating
athletes' techniques. Traditionally, experts propose significant features and
evaluate them using physics equations. However, the complexity of the human
body and its movements makes it challenging to explicitly analyze the
relationships between some features and athletes' final performance. With
advancements in modern machine learning and statistics, data analytics methods
have gained increasing importance in sports analytics. In this study, we
leverage machine learning models to analyze expert-proposed biomechanical
features from the finals of long jump competitions in the World Championships.
The objectives of the analysis include identifying the most important features
contributing to top-performing jumps and exploring the combined effects of
these key features. Using quantile regression, we model the relationship
between the biomechanical feature set and the target variable (effective
distance), with a particular focus on elite-level jumps. To interpret the
model, we apply SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) alongside Partial
Dependence Plots (PDPs) and Individual Conditional Expectation (ICE) plots. The
findings reveal that, beyond the well-documented velocity-related features,
specific technical aspects also play a pivotal role. For male athletes, the
angle of the knee of the supporting leg before take-off is identified as a key
factor for achieving top 10% performance in our dataset, with angles greater
than 169{\deg}contributing significantly to jump performance. In contrast, for
female athletes, the landing pose and approach step technique emerge as the
most critical features influencing top 10% performances, alongside velocity.
This study establishes a framework for analyzing the impact of various features
on athletic performance, with a particular emphasis on top-performing events.

Conclusion: 研究阐明了变换器相对于静态嵌入模型的优势，并通过实证模拟验证了理论结果。

Abstract: In-context learning (ICL) has garnered significant attention for its ability
to grasp functions/tasks from demonstrations. Recent studies suggest the
presence of a latent task/function vector in LLMs during ICL. Merullo et al.
(2024) showed that LLMs leverage this vector alongside the residual stream for
Word2Vec-like vector arithmetic, solving factual-recall ICL tasks.
Additionally, recent work empirically highlighted the key role of
Question-Answer data in enhancing factual-recall capabilities. Despite these
insights, a theoretical explanation remains elusive. To move one step forward,
we propose a theoretical framework building on empirically grounded
hierarchical concept modeling. We develop an optimization theory, showing how
nonlinear residual transformers trained via gradient descent on cross-entropy
loss perform factual-recall ICL tasks via vector arithmetic. We prove 0-1 loss
convergence and show the strong generalization, including robustness to concept
recombination and distribution shifts. These results elucidate the advantages
of transformers over static embedding predecessors. Empirical simulations
corroborate our theoretical insights.

TL;DR: RankList是一种新颖的列表式偏好学习框架，通过扩展RankNet，解决了局部比较的局限性，并提升了全局排名一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有成对偏好学习框架（如RankNet）仅能进行局部比较，难以捕捉全局排名一致性，限制了其在主观任务（如语音情感识别和图像美学评估）中的应用。

Method: 提出RankList框架，通过列表级监督建模局部和非局部排名约束，引入log-sum-exp近似提高训练效率，并扩展了跳步比较以增强全局排名准确性。

Result: 在多个基准数据集（如MSP-Podcast、IEMOCAP、BIIC Podcast和Artistic Image Aesthetics）上，RankList在Kendall's Tau和排名准确性上均优于基线方法。

Conclusion: RankList为建模主观学习场景中的有序偏好提供了一种统一且可扩展的方法，不仅提升了域内排名性能，还表现出更好的跨域泛化能力。

Abstract: Preference learning has gained significant attention in tasks involving
subjective human judgments, such as \emph{speech emotion recognition} (SER) and
image aesthetic assessment. While pairwise frameworks such as RankNet offer
robust modeling of relative preferences, they are inherently limited to local
comparisons and struggle to capture global ranking consistency. To address
these limitations, we propose RankList, a novel listwise preference learning
framework that generalizes RankNet to structured list-level supervision. Our
formulation explicitly models local and non-local ranking constraints within a
probabilistic framework. The paper introduces a log-sum-exp approximation to
improve training efficiency. We further extend RankList with skip-wise
comparisons, enabling progressive exposure to complex list structures and
enhancing global ranking fidelity. Extensive experiments demonstrate the
superiority of our method across diverse modalities. On benchmark SER datasets
(MSP-Podcast, IEMOCAP, BIIC Podcast), RankList achieves consistent improvements
in Kendall's Tau and ranking accuracy compared to standard listwise baselines.
We also validate our approach on aesthetic image ranking using the Artistic
Image Aesthetics dataset, highlighting its broad applicability. Through
ablation and cross-domain studies, we show that RankList not only improves
in-domain ranking but also generalizes better across datasets. Our framework
offers a unified, extensible approach for modeling ordered preferences in
subjective learning scenarios.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FedShard是一种联邦学习遗忘算法，首次同时保证效率公平性和性能公平性，解决了收敛、遗忘效率和公平性之间的权衡问题，并提出了新的公平性评估指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前联邦学习遗忘研究主要关注效率和有效性，而忽略了去中心化客户端在遗忘过程中的效率公平性和性能公平性。

Method: 提出FedShard算法，通过自适应解决收敛、遗忘效率和公平性之间的困境，并引入两种新的公平性评估指标。

Result: FedShard在遗忘性能和效率上均表现出公平性，实验显示其遗忘速度比从头训练快1.3-6.2倍，比现有最优方法快4.9倍。

Conclusion: FedShard有效解决了联邦学习遗忘中的公平性问题，并显著提升了遗忘效率。

Abstract: To protect clients' right to be forgotten in federated learning, federated
unlearning aims to remove the data contribution of leaving clients from the
global learned model. While current studies mainly focused on enhancing
unlearning efficiency and effectiveness, the crucial aspects of efficiency
fairness and performance fairness among decentralized clients during unlearning
have remained largely unexplored. In this study, we introduce FedShard, the
first federated unlearning algorithm designed to concurrently guarantee both
efficiency fairness and performance fairness. FedShard adaptively addresses the
challenges introduced by dilemmas among convergence, unlearning efficiency, and
unlearning fairness. Furthermore, we propose two novel metrics to
quantitatively assess the fairness of unlearning algorithms, which we prove to
satisfy well-known properties in other existing fairness measurements. Our
theoretical analysis and numerical evaluation validate FedShard's fairness in
terms of both unlearning performance and efficiency. We demonstrate that
FedShard mitigates unfairness risks such as cascaded leaving and poisoning
attacks and realizes more balanced unlearning costs among clients. Experimental
results indicate that FedShard accelerates the data unlearning process 1.3-6.2
times faster than retraining from scratch and 4.9 times faster than the
state-of-the-art exact unlearning methods.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种数据高效的蒸馏框架（DED），通过优化推理蒸馏的帕累托前沿，减少计算成本，同时提升推理能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管现有方法通过扩大语料库和多阶段训练提升了推理能力，但计算成本高昂，且推理的扩展规律尚未明确。

Method: DED框架通过选择最优教师模型、精心设计小规模语料库和多样化推理轨迹，实现高效推理蒸馏。

Result: 在数学推理和代码生成任务中，DED仅需0.8k样本即达到最先进水平，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: DED提供了一种高效且实用的推理能力提升途径，同时保持了模型的通用能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable reasoning capabilities in
tasks such as algorithmic coding and mathematical problem-solving. Recent
methods have improved reasoning through expanded corpus and multistage training
combining reinforcement learning and supervised fine-tuning. Although some
methods suggest that small but targeted dataset can incentivize reasoning via
only distillation, a reasoning scaling laws is still taking shape, increasing
computational costs. To address this, we propose a data-efficient distillation
framework (DED) that optimizes the Pareto frontier of reasoning distillation.
Inspired by the on-policy learning and diverse roll-out strategies of
reinforcement learning, the key idea of our approach is threefold: (1) We
identify that benchmark scores alone do not determine an effective teacher
model. Through comprehensive comparisons of leading reasoning LLMs, we develop
a method to select an optimal teacher model. (2) While scaling distillation can
enhance reasoning, it often degrades out-of-domain performance. A carefully
curated, smaller corpus achieves a balanced trade-off between in-domain and
out-of-domain capabilities. (3) Diverse reasoning trajectories encourage the
student model to develop robust reasoning skills. We validate our method
through evaluations on mathematical reasoning (AIME 2024/2025, MATH-500) and
code generation (LiveCodeBench), achieving state-of-the-art results with only
0.8k carefully curated examples, bypassing the need for extensive scaling. Our
systematic analysis demonstrates that DED outperforms existing methods by
considering factors beyond superficial hardness, token length, or teacher model
capability. This work offers a practical and efficient pathway to advanced
reasoning while preserving general capabilities.

TL;DR: 现代人工神经网络（ANN）在土壤属性预测中优于传统机器学习方法，特别是TabPFN表现最佳，建议将其作为新标准工具。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统深度学习方法在土壤光谱数据的小样本和高特征比例条件下表现不佳，而现代ANN的适用性尚未验证。

Method: 通过31个数据集评估多种ANN架构（如MLP、Transformer、TabPFN等）与传统方法（如随机森林、偏最小二乘回归）的性能。

Result: 现代ANN在多数任务中优于传统方法，TabPFN表现最稳健。

Conclusion: 现代ANN已成熟，建议将其作为土壤属性预测的新标准工具，尤其是TabPFN。

Abstract: In the field of pedometrics, tabular machine learning is the predominant
method for predicting soil properties from remote and proximal soil sensing
data, forming a central component of digital soil mapping. At the field-scale,
this predictive soil modeling (PSM) task is typically constrained by small
training sample sizes and high feature-to-sample ratios in soil spectroscopy.
Traditionally, these conditions have proven challenging for conventional deep
learning methods. Classical machine learning algorithms, particularly
tree-based models like Random Forest and linear models such as Partial Least
Squares Regression, have long been the default choice for field-scale PSM.
Recent advances in artificial neural networks (ANN) for tabular data challenge
this view, yet their suitability for field-scale PSM has not been proven. We
introduce a comprehensive benchmark that evaluates state-of-the-art ANN
architectures, including the latest multilayer perceptron (MLP)-based models
(TabM, RealMLP), attention-based transformer variants (FT-Transformer,
ExcelFormer, T2G-Former, AMFormer), retrieval-augmented approaches (TabR,
ModernNCA), and an in-context learning foundation model (TabPFN). Our
evaluation encompasses 31 field- and farm-scale datasets containing 30 to 460
samples and three critical soil properties: soil organic matter or soil organic
carbon, pH, and clay content. Our results reveal that modern ANNs consistently
outperform classical methods on the majority of tasks, demonstrating that deep
learning has matured sufficiently to overcome the long-standing dominance of
classical machine learning for PSM. Notably, TabPFN delivers the strongest
overall performance, showing robustness across varying conditions. We therefore
recommend the adoption of modern ANNs for field-scale PSM and propose TabPFN as
the new default choice in the toolkit of every pedometrician.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 异常检测中确认异常是否存在的研究较少，本文旨在填补这一空白，探讨何时能确定异常存在。

Method: 通过超过三百万次统计测试，分析不同异常检测任务和算法，研究数据集大小、污染率与算法常数之间的关系。

Result: 发现确认异常存在所需样本数量的下限条件：N ≥ α_algo/ν²，表明异常过于罕见时难以证明其存在。

Conclusion: 研究为异常检测提供了理论支持，明确了异常存在性的确认条件，对实际应用具有重要意义。

Abstract: Detecting whether any anomalies exist within a dataset is crucial for
effective anomaly detection, yet it remains surprisingly underexplored in
anomaly detection literature. This paper presents a comprehensive study that
addresses the fundamental question: When can we conclusively determine that
anomalies are present? Through extensive experimentation involving over three
million statistical tests across various anomaly detection tasks and
algorithms, we identify a relationship between the dataset size, contamination
rate, and an algorithm-dependent constant $ \alpha_{\text{algo}} $. Our results
demonstrate that, for an unlabeled dataset of size $ N $ and contamination rate
$ \nu $, the condition $ N \ge \frac{\alpha_{\text{algo}}}{\nu^2} $ represents
a lower bound on the number of samples required to confirm anomaly existence.
This threshold implies a limit to how rare anomalies can be before proving
their existence becomes infeasible.

TL;DR: 论文提出了四种策略（ReDP、CorDP、IC-DP、RouteDP），用于改进大型语言模型（LLMs）在上下文辅助预测任务中的零样本能力，展示了比直接提示更优的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的预测任务需要整合历史数据和上下文信息，而现有方法未充分挖掘LLMs的潜力。

Method: 通过四种策略：ReDP（提高可解释性）、CorDP（优化现有预测）、IC-DP（嵌入历史示例）、RouteDP（任务路由），改进LLMs的预测能力。

Result: 在CiK基准测试中，这些策略在不同规模和类型的LLMs上均优于直接提示方法。

Conclusion: 这些简单而有效的策略为LLM在上下文辅助预测中的应用提供了新方向。

Abstract: Forecasting in real-world settings requires models to integrate not only
historical data but also relevant contextual information, often available in
textual form. While recent work has shown that large language models (LLMs) can
be effective context-aided forecasters via na\"ive direct prompting, their full
potential remains underexplored. We address this gap with 4 strategies,
providing new insights into the zero-shot capabilities of LLMs in this setting.
ReDP improves interpretability by eliciting explicit reasoning traces, allowing
us to assess the model's reasoning over the context independently from its
forecast accuracy. CorDP leverages LLMs solely to refine existing forecasts
with context, enhancing their applicability in real-world forecasting
pipelines. IC-DP proposes embedding historical examples of context-aided
forecasting tasks in the prompt, substantially improving accuracy even for the
largest models. Finally, RouteDP optimizes resource efficiency by using LLMs to
estimate task difficulty, and routing the most challenging tasks to larger
models. Evaluated on different kinds of context-aided forecasting tasks from
the CiK benchmark, our strategies demonstrate distinct benefits over na\"ive
prompting across LLMs of different sizes and families. These results open the
door to further simple yet effective improvements in LLM-based context-aided
forecasting.

Motivation: 扩散模型计算成本高，现有方法如RDM依赖外部存储和静态模型，缺乏适应性。

Method: PDM利用对比学习构建动态视觉原型，指导去噪步骤，实现高效生成。

Result: PDM在保持高质量生成的同时，显著降低了计算和存储需求。

Conclusion: PDM为扩散模型提供了一种可扩展的替代方案，优于基于检索的方法。

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as a leading framework for high-quality image
generation, offering stable training and strong performance across diverse
domains. However, they remain computationally intensive, particularly during
the iterative denoising process. Latent-space models like Stable Diffusion
alleviate some of this cost by operating in compressed representations, though
at the expense of fine-grained detail. More recent approaches such as
Retrieval-Augmented Diffusion Models (RDM) address efficiency by conditioning
denoising on similar examples retrieved from large external memory banks. While
effective, these methods introduce drawbacks: they require costly storage and
retrieval infrastructure, depend on static vision-language models like CLIP for
similarity, and lack adaptability during training. We propose the Prototype
Diffusion Model (PDM), a method that integrates prototype learning directly
into the diffusion process for efficient and adaptive visual conditioning -
without external memory. Instead of retrieving reference samples, PDM
constructs a dynamic set of compact visual prototypes from clean image features
using contrastive learning. These prototypes guide the denoising steps by
aligning noisy representations with semantically relevant visual patterns,
enabling efficient generation with strong semantic grounding. Experiments show
that PDM maintains high generation quality while reducing computational and
storage overhead, offering a scalable alternative to retrieval-based
conditioning in diffusion models.

Conclusion: ResRMN通过创新的存储池设计和残差连接，显著提升了RNN的性能，为时间序列任务提供了新思路。

Abstract: We introduce a novel class of untrained Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)
within the Reservoir Computing (RC) paradigm, called Residual Reservoir Memory
Networks (ResRMNs). ResRMN combines a linear memory reservoir with a non-linear
reservoir, where the latter is based on residual orthogonal connections along
the temporal dimension for enhanced long-term propagation of the input. The
resulting reservoir state dynamics are studied through the lens of linear
stability analysis, and we investigate diverse configurations for the temporal
residual connections. The proposed approach is empirically assessed on
time-series and pixel-level 1-D classification tasks. Our experimental results
highlight the advantages of the proposed approach over other conventional RC
models.

Conclusion: 噪声超网络是一种高效的方法，能够在保持模型基础性能的同时优化目标特性。

Abstract: The new paradigm of test-time scaling has yielded remarkable breakthroughs in
Large Language Models (LLMs) (e.g. reasoning models) and in generative vision
models, allowing models to allocate additional computation during inference to
effectively tackle increasingly complex problems. Despite the improvements of
this approach, an important limitation emerges: the substantial increase in
computation time makes the process slow and impractical for many applications.
Given the success of this paradigm and its growing usage, we seek to preserve
its benefits while eschewing the inference overhead. In this work we propose
one solution to the critical problem of integrating test-time scaling knowledge
into a model during post-training. Specifically, we replace reward guided
test-time noise optimization in diffusion models with a Noise Hypernetwork that
modulates initial input noise. We propose a theoretically grounded framework
for learning this reward-tilted distribution for distilled generators, through
a tractable noise-space objective that maintains fidelity to the base model
while optimizing for desired characteristics. We show that our approach
recovers a substantial portion of the quality gains from explicit test-time
optimization at a fraction of the computational cost. Code is available at

Result: 模型在类增量学习任务中相对基线准确率提升了4.92%。

Conclusion: DyMoE方法有效解决了灾难性遗忘问题，并在性能和计算效率上表现出色。

Abstract: Graph incremental learning is a learning paradigm that aims to adapt trained
models to continuously incremented graphs and data over time without the need
for retraining on the full dataset. However, regular graph machine learning
methods suffer from catastrophic forgetting when applied to incremental
learning settings, where previously learned knowledge is overridden by new
knowledge. Previous approaches have tried to address this by treating the
previously trained model as an inseparable unit and using techniques to
maintain old behaviors while learning new knowledge. These approaches, however,
do not account for the fact that previously acquired knowledge at different
timestamps contributes differently to learning new tasks. Some prior patterns
can be transferred to help learn new data, while others may deviate from the
new data distribution and be detrimental. To address this, we propose a dynamic
mixture-of-experts (DyMoE) approach for incremental learning. Specifically, a
DyMoE GNN layer adds new expert networks specialized in modeling the incoming
data blocks. We design a customized regularization loss that utilizes data
sequence information so existing experts can maintain their ability to solve
old tasks while helping the new expert learn the new data effectively. As the
number of data blocks grows over time, the computational cost of the full
mixture-of-experts (MoE) model increases. To address this, we introduce a
sparse MoE approach, where only the top-$k$ most relevant experts make
predictions, significantly reducing the computation time. Our model achieved
4.92\% relative accuracy increase compared to the best baselines on class
incremental learning, showing the model's exceptional power.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的大型语言模型（如ChatGPT）采用二元拒绝边界来应对恶意提示，但这种方法对意图模糊的提示效果不佳，尤其在双重用途场景（如生物学或网络安全）中表现脆弱。

Method: 提出safe-completions方法，专注于助手输出的安全性而非用户意图的二元分类，旨在在安全政策约束内最大化实用性。

Result: 在GPT-5中应用该方法后，实验显示其提升了安全性（尤其是双重用途提示）、减少了安全失败的严重性，并显著增加了模型的实用性。

Conclusion: safe-completions方法在安全性和实用性方面优于传统的二元拒绝边界，适用于复杂场景。

Abstract: Large Language Models used in ChatGPT have traditionally been trained to
learn a refusal boundary: depending on the user's intent, the model is taught
to either fully comply or outright refuse. While this is a strong mitigation
for explicitly malicious prompts, focusing safety training on refusals can lead
to brittleness for prompts with obscured user intent. Binary refusal boundaries
are especially ill-suited for dual-use cases (such as biology or
cybersecurity), where a user request can be answered safely at a high level,
but in some cases can lead to malicious uplift if sufficiently detailed or
actionable. As an alternative, we propose safe-completions: a safety-training
approach that centers on the safety of the assistant's output, rather than a
binary classification of the user's intent. Safe-completions seek to maximize
helpfulness within the safety policy's constraints. We incorporated this
approach into GPT-5 and find that across both production comparisons and
internally controlled experiments, safe-completion training improves safety
(especially on dual-use prompts), reduces the severity of residual safety
failures, and substantially increases model helpfulness.

Result: 框架鼓励情境感知的XAI方法，支持有效沟通和伦理责任的解释开发。

Conclusion: 将解释视为社会技术设计过程，有助于开发透明且伦理的XAI系统。

Abstract: The field of Explainable AI (XAI) offers a wide range of techniques for
making complex models interpretable. Yet, in practice, generating meaningful
explanations is a context-dependent task that requires intentional design
choices to ensure accessibility and transparency. This paper reframes
explanation as a situated design process -- an approach particularly relevant
for practitioners involved in building and deploying explainable systems.
Drawing on prior research and principles from design thinking, we propose a
three-part framework for explanation design in XAI: asking Who needs the
explanation, What they need explained, and How that explanation should be
delivered. We also emphasize the need for ethical considerations, including
risks of epistemic inequality, reinforcing social inequities, and obscuring
accountability and governance. By treating explanation as a sociotechnical
design process, this framework encourages a context-aware approach to XAI that
supports effective communication and the development of ethically responsible
explanations.

Result: 发现合成图像缺乏真实医学现象的固有基础，可能引发伦理风险，提出了适应伦理挑战的技术标准和监管建议。

Conclusion: 需集体努力实现伦理MISyn，通过技术调整和多方监管减少伦理危害。

Abstract: The task of ethical Medical Image Synthesis (MISyn) is to ensure that the
MISyn techniques are researched and developed ethically throughout their entire
lifecycle, which is essential to prevent the negative impacts of MISyn. To
address the ever-increasing needs and requirements for ethical practice of
MISyn research and development, we first conduct a theoretical analysis that
identifies the key properties of ethical MISyn and intrinsic limits of MISyn.
We identify that synthetic images lack inherent grounding in real medical
phenomena, cannot fully represent the training medical images, and inevitably
introduce new distribution shifts and biases.
  Ethical risks can arise from not acknowledging the intrinsic limits and
weaknesses of synthetic images compared to medical images, with the extreme
form manifested as misinformation of MISyn that substitutes synthetic images
for medical images without acknowledgment. The resulting ethical harms include
eroding trust in the medical imaging dataset environment and causing
algorithmic discrimination towards stakeholders and the public.
  To facilitate collective efforts towards ethical MISyn within and outside the
medical image analysis community, we then propose practical supports for
ethical practice in MISyn based on the theoretical analysis, including ethical
practice recommendations that adapt the existing technical standards, problem
formulation, design, and evaluation practice of MISyn to the ethical
challenges; and oversight recommendations to facilitate checks and balances
from stakeholders and the public. We also present two case studies that
demonstrate how to apply the ethical practice recommendations in practice, and
identify gaps between existing practice and the ethical practice
recommendations.

TL;DR: STREAM标准旨在提高AI模型报告中评估结果的透明度，重点关注化学和生物基准，以增强公众信任。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 管理AI的灾难性风险需要透明评估其危险能力，公开评估内容和方法对建立信任至关重要。

Method: 通过与23位专家合作开发STREAM标准，提供最佳实践示例和三页报告模板。

Result: STREAM标准帮助开发者更清晰地展示评估结果，并帮助第三方评估报告的严谨性。

Conclusion: STREAM标准为AI开发者提供了透明报告评估结果的实用工具，有助于提升评估的透明度和可信度。

Abstract: Evaluations of dangerous AI capabilities are important for managing
catastrophic risks. Public transparency into these evaluations - including what
they test, how they are conducted, and how their results inform decisions - is
crucial for building trust in AI development. We propose STREAM (A Standard for
Transparently Reporting Evaluations in AI Model Reports), a standard to improve
how model reports disclose evaluation results, initially focusing on chemical
and biological (ChemBio) benchmarks. Developed in consultation with 23 experts
across government, civil society, academia, and frontier AI companies, this
standard is designed to (1) be a practical resource to help AI developers
present evaluation results more clearly, and (2) help third parties identify
whether model reports provide sufficient detail to assess the rigor of the
ChemBio evaluations. We concretely demonstrate our proposed best practices with
"gold standard" examples, and also provide a three-page reporting template to
enable AI developers to implement our recommendations more easily.

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于条件输入有向无环表格生成对抗网络（ciDATGAN）的框架，用于生成高质量合成人口数据，解决了传统方法在高维数据上的局限性，并提升了数据的多样性和关联性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法如迭代比例拟合（IPF）在高维数据上表现不佳，而现有深度学习方法缺乏对生成过程的控制，且难以捕捉家庭成员间的关联。本文旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 提出了一种名为ciDATGAN的模型，结合多种方法提升合成人口数据的性能，并应用于纽约州的合成人口生成。

Result: 生成的合成人口包含近2000万个体和750万户家庭，数据与普查边际匹配良好，且比PUMS数据多样性高17%，比Popgen基准方法高13%。

Conclusion: 本研究提供了一种增强合成人口数据生成的方法，具有更高的公平性和多样性意识。

Abstract: Synthetic population is an increasingly important material used in numerous
areas such as urban and transportation analysis. Traditional methods such as
iterative proportional fitting (IPF) is not capable of generating high-quality
data when facing datasets with high dimension. Latest population synthesis
methods using deep learning techniques can resolve such curse of
dimensionality. However, few controls are placed when using these methods, and
few of the methods are used to generate synthetic population capturing
associations among members in one household. In this study, we propose a
framework that tackles these issues. The framework uses a novel population
synthesis model, called conditional input directed acyclic tabular generative
adversarial network (ciDATGAN), as its core, and a basket of methods are
employed to enhance the population synthesis performance. We apply the model to
generate a synthetic population for the whole New York State as a public
resource for researchers and policymakers. The synthetic population includes
nearly 20 million individuals and 7.5 million households. The marginals
obtained from the synthetic population match the census marginals well while
maintaining similar associations among household members to the sample.
Compared to the PUMS data, the synthetic population provides data that is 17%
more diverse; when compared against a benchmark approach based on Popgen, the
proposed method is 13% more diverse. This study provides an approach that
encompasses multiple methods to enhance the population synthesis procedure with
greater equity- and diversity-awareness.

TL;DR: MetaKGRAG通过感知-评估-调整循环解决KG-RAG的认知盲点问题，提升结构化知识检索的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有KG-RAG框架存在认知盲点，导致相关性漂移和不完整证据，需要闭环优化。

Method: 提出MetaKGRAG框架，引入感知-评估-调整循环，实现路径感知的闭环优化。

Result: 在医学、法律和常识推理领域的五个数据集上，MetaKGRAG表现优于KG-RAG和自优化基线。

Conclusion: MetaKGRAG验证了路径感知优化在结构化知识检索中的重要性，性能显著提升。

Abstract: Knowledge Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (KG-RAG) significantly
enhances the reasoning capabilities of LargeLanguage Models by leveraging
structured knowledge. However, existing KG-RAG frameworks typically operate as
open-loop systems, suffering from cognitive blindness, an inability to
recognize their exploration deficiencies. This leads to relevance drift and
incomplete evidence, which existing self-refinement methods, designed for
unstructured text-based RAG, cannot effectively resolve due to the
path-dependent nature of graph exploration. To address this challenge, we
propose Metacognitive Knowledge Graph Retrieval Augmented Generation
(MetaKGRAG), a novel framework inspired by the human metacognition process,
which introduces a Perceive-Evaluate-Adjust cycle to enable path-aware,
closed-loop refinement. This cycle empowers the system to self-assess
exploration quality, identify deficiencies in coverage or relevance, and
perform trajectory-connected corrections from precise pivot points. Extensive
experiments across five datasets in the medical, legal, and commonsense
reasoning domains demonstrate that MetaKGRAG consistently outperforms strong
KG-RAG and self-refinement baselines. Our results validate the superiority of
our approach and highlight the critical need for path-aware refinement in
structured knowledge retrieval.

*Shuai Chang*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: DPR通过双编码器架构在段落检索中优于BM25等传统方法。本文探讨了在训练中为每个问题添加多个正段落的效果，发现即使在小批量下也能提高检索精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有DPR模型通常每个问题仅配对一个正段落训练，未研究多正段落的效果。

Method: 在训练中为每个问题引入多个正段落，并测试其对检索精度的影响。

Result: 实验表明，多正段落能持续提升检索精度，且支持单GPU训练。

Conclusion: 多正段落训练是提升DPR性能的有效方法。

Abstract: By leveraging a dual encoder architecture, Dense Passage Retrieval (DPR) has
outperformed traditional sparse retrieval algorithms such as BM25 in terms of
passage retrieval accuracy. Recently proposed methods have further enhanced
DPR's performance. However, these models typically pair each question with only
one positive passage during training, and the effect of associating multiple
positive passages has not been examined. In this paper, we explore the
performance of DPR when additional positive passages are incorporated during
training. Experimental results show that equipping each question with multiple
positive passages consistently improves retrieval accuracy, even when using a
significantly smaller batch size, which enables training on a single GPU.

TL;DR: TFRank是一种基于小型LLM的高效点对点推理排序模型，通过整合CoT数据、细粒度分数监督和多任务训练提升性能，并实现无需生成推理链的快速推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于大型LLM的推理密集型排序模型计算成本高且延迟大，限制了实际应用。

Method: TFRank采用小型LLM，结合CoT数据、细粒度分数监督和多任务训练，并通过“思维模式开关”和点对点格式约束实现高效推理。

Result: TFRank（如1.7B参数）在BRIGHT和BEIR基准测试中表现优异，性能接近更大模型。

Conclusion: TFRank在性能与效率间取得平衡，为实际系统集成高级推理提供了实用方案。

Abstract: Reasoning-intensive ranking models built on Large Language Models (LLMs) have
made notable progress, but existing approaches often rely on large-scale LLMs
and explicit Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, resulting in high computational
cost and latency that limit real-world use. To address this, we propose
\textbf{TFRank}, an efficient pointwise reasoning ranker based on small-scale
LLMs. To improve ranking performance, TFRank effectively integrates CoT data,
fine-grained score supervision, and multi-task training. Furthermore, it
achieves an efficient ``\textbf{T}hink-\textbf{F}ree" reasoning capability by
employing a ``think-mode switch'' and pointwise format constraints.
Specifically, this allows the model to leverage explicit reasoning during
training while delivering precise relevance scores for complex queries at
inference without generating any reasoning chains. Experiments show that TFRank
(e.g., 1.7B) achieves performance comparable to models with four times more
parameters on the BRIGHT benchmark, and demonstrates strong competitiveness on
the BEIR benchmark. Further analysis shows that TFRank achieves an effective
balance between performance and efficiency, providing a practical solution for
integrating advanced reasoning into real-world systems. Our code and data are
released in the repository: https://github.com/JOHNNY-fans/TFRank.

Motivation: 传统方法在处理混合数据类型和优化个性化排序时存在局限性，需要更高效的模型架构和数据整合方法。

Method: 采用多任务学习框架，整合表格与非表格数据，使用预训练的TinyBERT生成语义嵌入，并提出新型采样技术和可扩展的相关性标注机制。

Conclusion: 该方法在优化个性化产品搜索排序方面表现出色，为混合数据类型处理提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel model architecture for optimizing
personalized product search ranking using a multi-task learning (MTL)
framework. Our approach uniquely integrates tabular and non-tabular data,
leveraging a pre-trained TinyBERT model for semantic embeddings and a novel
sampling technique to capture diverse customer behaviors. We evaluate our model
against several baselines, including XGBoost, TabNet, FT-Transformer, DCN-V2,
and MMoE, focusing on their ability to handle mixed data types and optimize
personalized ranking. Additionally, we propose a scalable relevance labeling
mechanism based on click-through rates, click positions, and semantic
similarity, offering an alternative to traditional human-annotated labels.
Experimental results show that combining non-tabular data with advanced
embedding techniques in multi-task learning paradigm significantly enhances
model performance. Ablation studies further underscore the benefits of
incorporating relevance labels, fine-tuning TinyBERT layers, and TinyBERT
query-product embedding interactions. These results demonstrate the
effectiveness of our approach in achieving improved personalized product search
ranking.

TL;DR: NAPO框架通过负样本共享和动态奖励调整优化LLM推荐系统，提升准确性和减少流行度偏差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM推荐方法在利用负样本时存在计算开销大和忽略样本信息量差异的问题。

Method: 提出NAPO框架，包含负样本共享和动态奖励调整两项创新。

Result: 在三个公开数据集上，NAPO在推荐准确性和减少流行度偏差方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: NAPO有效解决了负样本利用问题，为LLM推荐系统提供了优化方案。

Abstract: Recommendation systems leverage user interaction data to suggest relevant
items while filtering out irrelevant (negative) ones. The rise of large
language models (LLMs) has garnered increasing attention for their potential in
recommendation tasks. However, existing methods for optimizing LLM-based
recommenders face challenges in effectively utilizing negative samples. Simply
integrating large numbers of negative samples can improve ranking accuracy and
mitigate popularity bias but often leads to increased computational overhead
and memory costs. Additionally, current approaches fail to account for the
varying informativeness of negative samples, leading to suboptimal optimization
performance. To address these issues, we propose NAPO
(\textbf{N}egative-\textbf{A}ware \textbf{P}reference \textbf{O}ptimization),
an enhanced framework for preference optimization in LLM-based recommendation.
NAPO introduces two key innovations: (1) in-batch negative sharing, which
expands the pool of negative samples without additional memory overhead, and
(2) dynamic reward margin adjustment, which adapts model updates based on the
confidence of negative samples. Extensive experiments on three public datasets
demonstrate that NAPO outperforms existing methods in both recommendation
accuracy and popularity bias reduction.

TL;DR: MUFASA模型通过多模态融合和稀疏注意力机制，解决了多模态推荐中内容理解与用户兴趣建模的挑战，显著提升了推荐效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态推荐虽能丰富物品理解，但如何有效利用多模态物品序列和多粒度用户兴趣仍具挑战。

Method: MUFASA包含多模态融合层（MFL）和稀疏注意力对齐层（SAL），分别实现高质量物品表征和长序列用户兴趣建模。

Result: 实验表明MUFASA优于现有基线，在线A/B测试验证了其实际效果。

Conclusion: MUFASA通过多模态融合和稀疏注意力机制，有效提升了推荐系统的性能。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal recommendation enable richer item
understanding, while modeling users' multi-scale interests across temporal
horizons has attracted growing attention. However, effectively exploiting
multimodal item sequences and mining multi-grained user interests to
substantially bridge the gap between content comprehension and recommendation
remain challenging. To address these issues, we propose MUFASA, a MUltimodal
Fusion And Sparse Attention-based Alignment model for long sequential
recommendation. Our model comprises two core components. First, the Multimodal
Fusion Layer (MFL) leverages item titles as a cross-genre semantic anchor and
is trained with a joint objective of four tailored losses that promote: (i)
cross-genre semantic alignment, (ii) alignment to the collaborative space for
recommendation, (iii) preserving the similarity structure defined by titles and
preventing modality representation collapse, and (iv) distributional
regularization of the fusion space. This yields high-quality fused item
representations for further preference alignment. Second, the Sparse
Attention-guided Alignment Layer (SAL) scales to long user-behavior sequences
via a multi-granularity sparse attention mechanism, which incorporates windowed
attention, block-level attention, and selective attention, to capture user
interests hierarchically and across temporal horizons. SAL explicitly models
both the evolution of coherent interest blocks and fine-grained intra-block
variations, producing robust user and item representations. Extensive
experiments on real-world benchmarks show that MUFASA consistently surpasses
state-of-the-art baselines. Moreover, online A/B tests demonstrate significant
gains in production, confirming MUFASA's effectiveness in leveraging multimodal
cues and accurately capturing diverse user preferences.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种无需微调的框架，通过多模态大语言模型（MLLM）生成视频的丰富自然语言描述，以提升推荐系统的语义理解能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频推荐系统依赖低层特征或用户定义的元数据，无法捕捉深层语义（如意图、幽默等），影响个性化推荐效果。

Method: 使用现成的MLLM生成视频的自然语言描述，结合文本编码器，输入到多种推荐模型中。

Result: 在MicroLens-100K数据集上，该方法在五种代表性模型中优于传统特征。

Conclusion: MLLM可作为动态知识提取器，帮助构建更理解用户意图的视频推荐系统。

Abstract: Existing video recommender systems rely primarily on user-defined metadata or
on low-level visual and acoustic signals extracted by specialised encoders.
These low-level features describe what appears on the screen but miss deeper
semantics such as intent, humour, and world knowledge that make clips resonate
with viewers. For example, is a 30-second clip simply a singer on a rooftop, or
an ironic parody filmed amid the fairy chimneys of Cappadocia, Turkey? Such
distinctions are critical to personalised recommendations yet remain invisible
to traditional encoding pipelines. In this paper, we introduce a simple,
recommendation system-agnostic zero-finetuning framework that injects
high-level semantics into the recommendation pipeline by prompting an
off-the-shelf Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) to summarise each clip
into a rich natural-language description (e.g. "a superhero parody with
slapstick fights and orchestral stabs"), bridging the gap between raw content
and user intent. We use MLLM output with a state-of-the-art text encoder and
feed it into standard collaborative, content-based, and generative
recommenders. On the MicroLens-100K dataset, which emulates user interactions
with TikTok-style videos, our framework consistently surpasses conventional
video, audio, and metadata features in five representative models. Our findings
highlight the promise of leveraging MLLMs as on-the-fly knowledge extractors to
build more intent-aware video recommenders.
