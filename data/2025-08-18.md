### [1] [Privacy Enhancement for Gaze Data Using a Noise-Infused Autoencoder](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10918)
*Samantha Aziz,Oleg Komogortsev*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于潜在噪声自编码器的隐私增强机制，保护用户视线数据不被未经同意地跨会话重新识别，同时保留数据的实用性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视线数据在生物识别和视线预测任务中具有敏感性，需要一种机制在保护隐私的同时不显著降低数据实用性。

Method: 使用潜在噪声自编码器对视线信号进行处理，平衡隐私保护和数据实用性。

Result: 显著降低了生物识别的可识别性，同时实用性损失最小，且保留了生理上合理的视线模式。

Conclusion: 该机制为视线数据提供了有效的隐私保护，同时适用于下游任务，推动了视线系统隐私保护的发展。

Abstract: We present a privacy-enhancing mechanism for gaze signals using a
latent-noise autoencoder that prevents users from being re-identified across
play sessions without their consent, while retaining the usability of the data
for benign tasks. We evaluate privacy-utility trade-offs across biometric
identification and gaze prediction tasks, showing that our approach
significantly reduces biometric identifiability with minimal utility
degradation. Unlike prior methods in this direction, our framework retains
physiologically plausible gaze patterns suitable for downstream use, which
produces favorable privacy-utility trade-off. This work advances privacy in
gaze-based systems by providing a usable and effective mechanism for protecting
sensitive gaze data.

### [2] [A Survey on Video Temporal Grounding with Multimodal Large Language Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10922)
*Jianlong Wu,Wei Liu,Ye Liu,Meng Liu,Liqiang Nie,Zhouchen Lin,Chang Wen Chen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文综述了基于多模态大语言模型（MLLMs）的视频时间定位（VTG）研究，通过三维分类法系统分析了当前研究，并讨论了数据集、评估方法和未来方向。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管视频语言理解已有广泛研究，但针对VTG-MLLMs的全面综述仍稀缺，本文旨在填补这一空白。

Method: 采用三维分类法：1) MLLMs的功能角色；2) 训练范式；3) 视频特征处理技术。

Result: VTG-MLLMs在性能和多任务泛化方面优于传统方法，但仍存在局限性。

Conclusion: 本文总结了VTG-MLLMs的研究现状，提出了未来研究方向，并提供了资源库链接。

Abstract: The recent advancement in video temporal grounding (VTG) has significantly
enhanced fine-grained video understanding, primarily driven by multimodal large
language models (MLLMs). With superior multimodal comprehension and reasoning
abilities, VTG approaches based on MLLMs (VTG-MLLMs) are gradually surpassing
traditional fine-tuned methods. They not only achieve competitive performance
but also excel in generalization across zero-shot, multi-task, and multi-domain
settings. Despite extensive surveys on general video-language understanding,
comprehensive reviews specifically addressing VTG-MLLMs remain scarce. To fill
this gap, this survey systematically examines current research on VTG-MLLMs
through a three-dimensional taxonomy: 1) the functional roles of MLLMs,
highlighting their architectural significance; 2) training paradigms, analyzing
strategies for temporal reasoning and task adaptation; and 3) video feature
processing techniques, which determine spatiotemporal representation
effectiveness. We further discuss benchmark datasets, evaluation protocols, and
summarize empirical findings. Finally, we identify existing limitations and
propose promising research directions. For additional resources and details,

### [3] [VSF: Simple, Efficient, and Effective Negative Guidance in Few-Step Image Generation Models By \underline{V}alue \underline{S}ign \underline{F}lip](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10931)
*Wenqi Guo,Shan Du*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VSF是一种简单高效的方法，通过翻转负提示的注意力值符号，动态抑制不需要的内容，适用于少步扩散和流匹配图像生成模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法如CFG、NASA和NAG在负提示引导上存在不足，VSF旨在更高效地抑制不需要的内容。

Method: VSF通过翻转负提示的注意力值符号动态抑制内容，计算开销小，适用于多种架构。

Result: 实验表明，VSF在少步模型中显著优于现有方法，且在非少步模型中也能超越CFG，同时保持图像质量。

Conclusion: VSF是一种高效且通用的负提示引导方法，适用于多种图像生成任务。

Abstract: We introduce Value Sign Flip (VSF), a simple and efficient method for
incorporating negative prompt guidance in few-step diffusion and flow-matching
image generation models. Unlike existing approaches such as classifier-free
guidance (CFG), NASA, and NAG, VSF dynamically suppresses undesired content by
flipping the sign of attention values from negative prompts. Our method
requires only small computational overhead and integrates effectively with
MMDiT-style architectures such as Stable Diffusion 3.5 Turbo, as well as
cross-attention-based models like Wan. We validate VSF on challenging datasets
with complex prompt pairs and demonstrate superior performance in both static
image and video generation tasks. Experimental results show that VSF
significantly improves negative prompt adherence compared to prior methods in
few-step models, and even CFG in non-few-step models, while maintaining
competitive image quality. Code and ComfyUI node are available in

### [4] [Relative Pose Regression with Pose Auto-Encoders: Enhancing Accuracy and Data Efficiency for Retail Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10933)
*Yoli Shavit,Yosi Keller*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种基于相机姿态自动编码器（PAE）的相对姿态回归（RPR）方法，用于改进单图像绝对姿态回归（APR）的定位精度，无需额外存储图像或姿态数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代零售环境中，精确的相机定位对提升客户体验、优化库存管理和实现自主运营至关重要。现有方法中，结合视觉和空间场景先验的APR方法表现更优，但仍有改进空间。

Method: 扩展PAE至RPR任务，提出一种新的重定位方案，利用基于PAE的RPR优化APR预测，无需额外数据存储。

Result: 实验表明，该方法在室内基准测试中显著提高了APR定位精度，且仅需30%的训练数据即可达到竞争性能。

Conclusion: 该方法有效降低了零售部署中的数据收集负担，同时提升了定位精度。

Abstract: Accurate camera localization is crucial for modern retail environments,
enabling enhanced customer experiences, streamlined inventory management, and
autonomous operations. While Absolute Pose Regression (APR) from a single image
offers a promising solution, approaches that incorporate visual and spatial
scene priors tend to achieve higher accuracy. Camera Pose Auto-Encoders (PAEs)
have recently been introduced to embed such priors into APR. In this work, we
extend PAEs to the task of Relative Pose Regression (RPR) and propose a novel
re-localization scheme that refines APR predictions using PAE-based RPR,
without requiring additional storage of images or pose data. We first introduce
PAE-based RPR and establish its effectiveness by comparing it with image-based
RPR models of equivalent architectures. We then demonstrate that our refinement
strategy, driven by a PAE-based RPR, enhances APR localization accuracy on
indoor benchmarks. Notably, our method is shown to achieve competitive
performance even when trained with only 30% of the data, substantially reducing
the data collection burden for retail deployment. Our code and pre-trained
models are available at: https://github.com/yolish/camera-pose-auto-encoders

### [5] [ViPE: Video Pose Engine for 3D Geometric Perception](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10934)
*Jiahui Huang,Qunjie Zhou,Hesam Rabeti,Aleksandr Korovko,Huan Ling,Xuanchi Ren,Tianchang Shen,Jun Gao,Dmitry Slepichev,Chen-Hsuan Lin,Jiawei Ren,Kevin Xie,Joydeep Biswas,Laura Leal-Taixe,Sanja Fidler*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ViPE是一种高效视频处理引擎，用于从无约束视频中估计相机参数和深度图，性能优于现有基线，并支持多种场景和相机模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决从野外视频中获取一致且精确的3D注释的挑战，推动空间AI系统的发展。

Method: ViPE通过估计相机内参、相机运动和密集深度图来处理视频，支持多种场景和相机模型。

Result: 在TUM/KITTI序列上性能提升18%/50%，运行速度为3-5FPS，并标注了大规模视频数据集。

Conclusion: ViPE及其标注数据集的开源有望加速空间AI系统的开发。

Abstract: Accurate 3D geometric perception is an important prerequisite for a wide
range of spatial AI systems. While state-of-the-art methods depend on
large-scale training data, acquiring consistent and precise 3D annotations from
in-the-wild videos remains a key challenge. In this work, we introduce ViPE, a
handy and versatile video processing engine designed to bridge this gap. ViPE
efficiently estimates camera intrinsics, camera motion, and dense, near-metric
depth maps from unconstrained raw videos. It is robust to diverse scenarios,
including dynamic selfie videos, cinematic shots, or dashcams, and supports
various camera models such as pinhole, wide-angle, and 360{\deg} panoramas. We
have benchmarked ViPE on multiple benchmarks. Notably, it outperforms existing
uncalibrated pose estimation baselines by 18%/50% on TUM/KITTI sequences, and
runs at 3-5FPS on a single GPU for standard input resolutions. We use ViPE to
annotate a large-scale collection of videos. This collection includes around
100K real-world internet videos, 1M high-quality AI-generated videos, and 2K
panoramic videos, totaling approximately 96M frames -- all annotated with
accurate camera poses and dense depth maps. We open-source ViPE and the
annotated dataset with the hope of accelerating the development of spatial AI
systems.

### [6] [HQ-OV3D: A High Box Quality Open-World 3D Detection Framework based on Diffision Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10935)
*Qi Liu,Yabei Li,Hongsong Wang,Lei He*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HQ-OV3D框架通过跨模态几何一致性和标注类辅助去噪机制，提升了开放词汇3D检测中伪标签的几何质量，显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统封闭集3D检测无法满足开放世界应用需求，现有开放词汇方法在几何质量（如边界框精度）上存在不足。

Method: 提出HQ-OV3D框架，包含跨模态验证的提案生成器和标注类辅助去噪器，通过几何一致性提升伪标签质量。

Result: 在新型类别上mAP提升7.37%，伪标签质量显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: HQ-OV3D可作为独立检测器或插件，提升开放词汇3D检测的伪标签生成质量。

Abstract: Traditional closed-set 3D detection frameworks fail to meet the demands of
open-world applications like autonomous driving. Existing open-vocabulary 3D
detection methods typically adopt a two-stage pipeline consisting of
pseudo-label generation followed by semantic alignment. While vision-language
models (VLMs) recently have dramatically improved the semantic accuracy of
pseudo-labels, their geometric quality, particularly bounding box precision,
remains commonly neglected.To address this issue, we propose a High Box Quality
Open-Vocabulary 3D Detection (HQ-OV3D) framework, dedicated to generate and
refine high-quality pseudo-labels for open-vocabulary classes. The framework
comprises two key components: an Intra-Modality Cross-Validated (IMCV) Proposal
Generator that utilizes cross-modality geometric consistency to generate
high-quality initial 3D proposals, and an Annotated-Class Assisted (ACA)
Denoiser that progressively refines 3D proposals by leveraging geometric priors
from annotated categories through a DDIM-based denoising mechanism.Compared to
the state-of-the-art method, training with pseudo-labels generated by our
approach achieves a 7.37% improvement in mAP on novel classes, demonstrating
the superior quality of the pseudo-labels produced by our framework. HQ-OV3D
can serve not only as a strong standalone open-vocabulary 3D detector but also
as a plug-in high-quality pseudo-label generator for existing open-vocabulary
detection or annotation pipelines.

### [7] [Vision-Only Gaussian Splatting for Collaborative Semantic Occupancy Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10936)
*Cheng Chen,Hao Huang,Saurabh Bagchi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于稀疏3D语义高斯泼溅的协作3D语义占用预测方法，显著提升了性能并降低了通信成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有视觉方法在3D语义占用预测中因密集体素或2D特征导致的高通信成本或深度依赖问题。

Method: 通过共享和融合中间高斯基元，实现跨代理融合、几何与语义联合编码及稀疏对象中心消息传递。

Result: 在mIoU和IoU上分别优于单代理和基线协作方法，且在低通信量下仍保持性能优势。

Conclusion: 该方法在协作感知中表现出高效性和鲁棒性，适用于通信受限场景。

Abstract: Collaborative perception enables connected vehicles to share information,
overcoming occlusions and extending the limited sensing range inherent in
single-agent (non-collaborative) systems. Existing vision-only methods for 3D
semantic occupancy prediction commonly rely on dense 3D voxels, which incur
high communication costs, or 2D planar features, which require accurate depth
estimation or additional supervision, limiting their applicability to
collaborative scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose the first
approach leveraging sparse 3D semantic Gaussian splatting for collaborative 3D
semantic occupancy prediction. By sharing and fusing intermediate Gaussian
primitives, our method provides three benefits: a neighborhood-based
cross-agent fusion that removes duplicates and suppresses noisy or inconsistent
Gaussians; a joint encoding of geometry and semantics in each primitive, which
reduces reliance on depth supervision and allows simple rigid alignment; and
sparse, object-centric messages that preserve structural information while
reducing communication volume. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
approach outperforms single-agent perception and baseline collaborative methods
by +8.42 and +3.28 points in mIoU, and +5.11 and +22.41 points in IoU,
respectively. When further reducing the number of transmitted Gaussians, our
method still achieves a +1.9 improvement in mIoU, using only 34.6%
communication volume, highlighting robust performance under limited
communication budgets.

### [8] [Personalized Face Super-Resolution with Identity Decoupling and Fitting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10937)
*Jiarui Yang,Hang Guo,Wen Huang,Tao Dai,Shutao Xia*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为IDFSR的新方法，用于在极端退化场景下提升人脸超分辨率（FSR）的身份（ID）恢复能力，同时减少幻觉效应。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在极端退化（如缩放比例>8倍）时，难以恢复真实且ID一致的人脸，常生成缺乏真实ID约束的幻觉人脸。

Method: IDFSR通过掩蔽低分辨率图像中的面部区域、对齐参考图像以提供风格指导，并利用真实图像的ID嵌入进行细粒度ID建模。

Result: 实验表明，IDFSR在极端退化场景下显著优于现有方法，特别是在ID一致性方面表现优异。

Conclusion: IDFSR通过解耦和拟合身份信息，有效提升了极端退化场景下的人脸超分辨率质量。

Abstract: In recent years, face super-resolution (FSR) methods have achieved remarkable
progress, generally maintaining high image fidelity and identity (ID)
consistency under standard settings. However, in extreme degradation scenarios
(e.g., scale $> 8\times$), critical attributes and ID information are often
severely lost in the input image, making it difficult for conventional models
to reconstruct realistic and ID-consistent faces. Existing methods tend to
generate hallucinated faces under such conditions, producing restored images
lacking authentic ID constraints. To address this challenge, we propose a novel
FSR method with Identity Decoupling and Fitting (IDFSR), designed to enhance ID
restoration under large scaling factors while mitigating hallucination effects.
Our approach involves three key designs: 1) \textbf{Masking} the facial region
in the low-resolution (LR) image to eliminate unreliable ID cues; 2)
\textbf{Warping} a reference image to align with the LR input, providing style
guidance; 3) Leveraging \textbf{ID embeddings} extracted from ground truth (GT)
images for fine-grained ID modeling and personalized adaptation. We first
pretrain a diffusion-based model to explicitly decouple style and ID by forcing
it to reconstruct masked LR face regions using both style and identity
embeddings. Subsequently, we freeze most network parameters and perform
lightweight fine-tuning of the ID embedding using a small set of target ID
images. This embedding encodes fine-grained facial attributes and precise ID
information, significantly improving both ID consistency and perceptual
quality. Extensive quantitative evaluations and visual comparisons demonstrate
that the proposed IDFSR substantially outperforms existing approaches under
extreme degradation, particularly achieving superior performance on ID
consistency.

Conclusion: 轻量级深度学习模型在资源受限环境中具有实时高精度物种识别的潜力，为生态信息学提供了可扩展的图像解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate identification of wood species plays a critical role in ecological
monitoring, biodiversity conservation, and sustainable forest management.
Traditional classification approaches relying on macroscopic and microscopic
inspection are labor-intensive and require expert knowledge. In this study, we
explore the application of deep learning to automate the classification of ten
wood species commonly found in Vietnam. A custom image dataset was constructed
from field-collected wood samples, and five state-of-the-art convolutional
neural network architectures--ResNet50, EfficientNet, MobileViT, MobileNetV3,
and ShuffleNetV2--were evaluated. Among these, ShuffleNetV2 achieved the best
balance between classification performance and computational efficiency, with
an average accuracy of 99.29\% and F1-score of 99.35\% over 20 independent
runs. These results demonstrate the potential of lightweight deep learning
models for real-time, high-accuracy species identification in
resource-constrained environments. Our work contributes to the growing field of
ecological informatics by providing scalable, image-based solutions for
automated wood classification and forest biodiversity assessment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提升卷积神经网络在图像分类任务中的鲁棒性和特征表达能力。

Method: 动态调整池化参数并应用ReLU激活函数，结合自适应最大池化。

Result: 在MNIST Digits、MNIST Fashion和CIFAR-10数据集上，NIRMAL Pooling的测试准确率均优于传统最大池化。

Conclusion: NIRMAL Pooling为图像识别任务提供了一种灵活可靠的池化方法，性能优于传统方法。

Abstract: This paper presents NIRMAL Pooling, a novel pooling layer for Convolutional
Neural Networks (CNNs) that integrates adaptive max pooling with non-linear
activation function for image classification tasks. The acronym NIRMAL stands
for Non-linear Activation, Intermediate Aggregation, Reduction, Maximum,
Adaptive, and Localized. By dynamically adjusting pooling parameters based on
desired output dimensions and applying a Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU)
activation post-pooling, NIRMAL Pooling improves robustness and feature
expressiveness. We evaluated its performance against standard Max Pooling on
three benchmark datasets: MNIST Digits, MNIST Fashion, and CIFAR-10. NIRMAL
Pooling achieves test accuracies of 99.25% (vs. 99.12% for Max Pooling) on
MNIST Digits, 91.59% (vs. 91.44%) on MNIST Fashion, and 70.49% (vs. 68.87%) on
CIFAR-10, demonstrating consistent improvements, particularly on complex
datasets. This work highlights the potential of NIRMAL Pooling to enhance CNN
performance in diverse image recognition tasks, offering a flexible and
reliable alternative to traditional pooling methods.

### [11] [Topological Structure Description for Artcode Detection Using the Shape of Orientation Histogram](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10942)
*Liming Xu,Dave Towey,Andrew P. French,Steve Benford*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文研究了Artcodes的检测问题，提出了一种新的特征描述符（形状方向直方图）用于识别拓扑结构相似的物体，并通过实验验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着智能手机和VR/AR技术的普及，环境中可能出现更多与虚拟元素连接的物体，识别这些物体是触发后续交互的第一步。

Method: 提出了一种名为形状方向直方图的新特征描述符，用于描述Artcodes的通用拓扑结构，并构建了检测系统。

Result: 实验结果表明，该特征描述符能有效表示拓扑结构，检测系统性能良好。

Conclusion: 本研究为拓扑物体检测提供了初步解决方案，有望拓展新的交互方式和应用场景。

Abstract: The increasing ubiquity of smartphones and resurgence of VR/AR techniques, it
is expected that our everyday environment may soon be decorating with objects
connecting with virtual elements. Alerting to the presence of these objects is
therefore the first step for motivating follow-up further inspection and
triggering digital material attached to the objects. This work studies a
special kind of these objects -- Artcodes -- a human-meaningful and
machine-readable decorative markers that camouflage themselves with freeform
appearance by encoding information into their topology. We formulate this
problem of recongising the presence of Artcodes as Artcode proposal detection,
a distinct computer vision task that classifies topologically similar but
geometrically and semantically different objects as a same class. To deal with
this problem, we propose a new feature descriptor, called the shape of
orientation histogram, to describe the generic topological structure of an
Artcode. We collect datasets and conduct comprehensive experiments to evaluate
the performance of the Artcode detection proposer built upon this new feature
vector. Our experimental results show the feasibility of the proposed feature
vector for representing topological structures and the effectiveness of the
system for detecting Artcode proposals. Although this work is an initial
attempt to develop a feature-based system for detecting topological objects
like Artcodes, it would open up new interaction opportunities and spark
potential applications of topological object detection.

### [12] [TrajSV: A Trajectory-based Model for Sports Video Representations and Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11569)
*Zheng Wang,Shihao Xu,Wei Shi*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: TrajSV是一种基于轨迹的框架，解决了体育分析中的数据不可用、缺乏有效轨迹框架和需要监督标签的问题，通过数据预处理、CRNet和VRNet三个组件实现无监督学习，并在体育视频检索、动作识别和视频字幕任务中表现出色。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决体育分析中数据不可用、缺乏有效轨迹框架和需要监督标签的问题。

Method: 提出TrajSV框架，包括数据预处理、Clip Representation Network (CRNet) 和 Video Representation Network (VRNet)，采用三重对比损失进行无监督优化。

Result: 在体育视频检索、动作识别和视频字幕任务中表现优异，检索性能提升近70%，动作识别在17类中9类领先，视频字幕提升近20%。

Conclusion: TrajSV在体育视频分析中表现出色，并通过实际部署系统验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Sports analytics has received significant attention from both academia and
industry in recent years. Despite the growing interest and efforts in this
field, several issues remain unresolved, including (1) data unavailability, (2)
lack of an effective trajectory-based framework, and (3) requirement for
sufficient supervision labels. In this paper, we present TrajSV, a
trajectory-based framework that addresses various issues in existing studies.
TrajSV comprises three components: data preprocessing, Clip Representation
Network (CRNet), and Video Representation Network (VRNet). The data
preprocessing module extracts player and ball trajectories from sports
broadcast videos. CRNet utilizes a trajectory-enhanced Transformer module to
learn clip representations based on these trajectories. Additionally, VRNet
learns video representations by aggregating clip representations and visual
features with an encoder-decoder architecture. Finally, a triple contrastive
loss is introduced to optimize both video and clip representations in an
unsupervised manner. The experiments are conducted on three broadcast video
datasets to verify the effectiveness of TrajSV for three types of sports (i.e.,
soccer, basketball, and volleyball) with three downstream applications (i.e.,
sports video retrieval, action spotting, and video captioning). The results
demonstrate that TrajSV achieves state-of-the-art performance in sports video
retrieval, showcasing a nearly 70% improvement. It outperforms baselines in
action spotting, achieving state-of-the-art results in 9 out of 17 action
categories, and demonstrates a nearly 20% improvement in video captioning.
Additionally, we introduce a deployed system along with the three applications
based on TrajSV.

*Christian Düreth,Jan Condé-Wolter,Marek Danczak,Karsten Tittmann,Jörn Jaschinski,Andreas Hornig,Maik Gude*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种基于低分辨率CT的框架，用于量化干纺织增强材料在压实过程中的嵌套行为，并通过3D-UNet和两点相关函数分析结构特征。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解纺织增强复合材料的多尺度结构对预测其机械性能至关重要，尤其是嵌套行为对刚度、渗透性和损伤容限的影响。

Method: 采用低分辨率CT进行原位压实实验，利用3D-UNet进行语义分割，并通过两点相关函数分析空间结构。

Result: 模型在分割任务中表现优异（IoU为0.822，F1分数为0.902），结果与显微图像验证一致。

Conclusion: 该方法为从工业CT数据中提取关键几何特征提供了可靠途径，并为逆向建模和基于描述符的结构分析奠定了基础。

Abstract: A detailed understanding of material structure across multiple scales is
essential for predictive modeling of textile-reinforced composites. Nesting --
characterized by the interlocking of adjacent fabric layers through local
interpenetration and misalignment of yarns -- plays a critical role in defining
mechanical properties such as stiffness, permeability, and damage tolerance.
This study presents a framework to quantify nesting behavior in dry textile
reinforcements under compaction using low-resolution computed tomography (CT).
In-situ compaction experiments were conducted on various stacking
configurations, with CT scans acquired at 20.22 $\mu$m per voxel resolution. A
tailored 3D{-}UNet enabled semantic segmentation of matrix, weft, and fill
phases across compaction stages corresponding to fiber volume contents of
50--60 %. The model achieved a minimum mean Intersection-over-Union of 0.822
and an $F1$ score of 0.902. Spatial structure was subsequently analyzed using
the two-point correlation function $S_2$, allowing for probabilistic extraction
of average layer thickness and nesting degree. The results show strong
agreement with micrograph-based validation. This methodology provides a robust
approach for extracting key geometrical features from industrially relevant CT
data and establishes a foundation for reverse modeling and descriptor-based
structural analysis of composite preforms.

### [14] [ORBIT: An Object Property Reasoning Benchmark for Visual Inference Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10956)
*Abhishek Kolari,Mohammadhossein Khojasteh,Yifan Jiang,Floris den Hengst,Filip Ilievski*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了ORBIT，一个多层次的视觉问答（VQA）基准测试，用于评估视觉语言模型（VLMs）在对象属性推理上的表现，发现现有模型在复杂推理和真实图像上表现不佳。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有VQA基准测试在对象属性推理上存在局限性，缺乏对感知和推理的区分以及多样化的图像类别。

Method: 提出ORBIT基准测试，包含360张图像和1,080个计数问题，涵盖三种图像类型、三种推理复杂度和四种对象属性维度。

Result: 在零样本设置下测试12种先进VLMs，最佳模型准确率仅40%，尤其在真实图像和复杂推理任务上表现较差。

Conclusion: ORBIT揭示了VLMs在对象属性推理上的不足，呼吁开发更可扩展的基准测试和推理模型。

Abstract: While vision-language models (VLMs) have made remarkable progress on many
popular visual question answering (VQA) benchmarks, it remains unclear whether
they abstract and reason over depicted objects. Inspired by human object
categorisation, object property reasoning involves identifying and recognising
low-level details and higher-level abstractions. While current VQA benchmarks
consider a limited set of object property attributes like size, they typically
blend perception and reasoning, and lack representativeness in terms of
reasoning and image categories. To this end, we introduce a systematic
evaluation framework with images of three representative types, three reasoning
levels of increasing complexity, and four object property dimensions driven by
prior work on commonsense reasoning. We develop a procedure to instantiate this
benchmark into ORBIT, a multi-level reasoning VQA benchmark for object
properties comprising 360 images paired with a total of 1,080 count-based
questions. Experiments with 12 state-of-the-art VLMs in zero-shot settings
reveal significant limitations compared to humans, with the best-performing
model only reaching 40\% accuracy. VLMs struggle particularly with realistic

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 道路坑洞对安全和车辆寿命构成威胁，尤其在印度等道路维护不足的地区。

Method: 利用自标注数据集和YOLO模型进行实时检测，结合OCR模块提取时间戳并与GPS同步，数据存储在数据库中并通过OSM可视化。

Result: 系统在复杂条件下提高了检测精度，并生成政府可用的道路评估数据。

Conclusion: iWatchRoad是一个成本低、硬件高效且可扩展的解决方案，适用于发展中国家的道路管理。

Abstract: Potholes on the roads are a serious hazard and maintenance burden. This poses
a significant threat to road safety and vehicle longevity, especially on the
diverse and under-maintained roads of India. In this paper, we present a
complete end-to-end system called iWatchRoad for automated pothole detection,
Global Positioning System (GPS) tagging, and real time mapping using
OpenStreetMap (OSM). We curated a large, self-annotated dataset of over 7,000
frames captured across various road types, lighting conditions, and weather
scenarios unique to Indian environments, leveraging dashcam footage. This
dataset is used to fine-tune, Ultralytics You Only Look Once (YOLO) model to
perform real time pothole detection, while a custom Optical Character
Recognition (OCR) module was employed to extract timestamps directly from video
frames. The timestamps are synchronized with GPS logs to geotag each detected
potholes accurately. The processed data includes the potholes' details and
frames as metadata is stored in a database and visualized via a user friendly
web interface using OSM. iWatchRoad not only improves detection accuracy under
challenging conditions but also provides government compatible outputs for road
assessment and maintenance planning through the metadata visible on the
website. Our solution is cost effective, hardware efficient, and scalable,
offering a practical tool for urban and rural road management in developing
regions, making the system automated. iWatchRoad is available at

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为增量补丁生成（IPG）的方法，能比现有方法高效11.1倍地生成对抗性补丁，同时保持攻击性能。实验证明IPG能生成泛化性强的补丁，覆盖更多模型漏洞，并可作为构建鲁棒模型的基础。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对抗性补丁对AI模型的鲁棒性构成挑战，尤其在计算机视觉任务中。传统对抗样本的局限性促使研究更高效的生成方法。

Method: 提出增量补丁生成（IPG）方法，通过实验和消融研究（如YOLO特征分布可视化和对抗训练）验证其高效性和泛化能力。

Result: IPG生成的补丁效率高且攻击性能强，能覆盖更广的模型漏洞，并可用于构建鲁棒模型。

Conclusion: IPG在对抗性补丁防御和实际应用（如自动驾驶、安防系统、医学影像）中具有潜力，能提升AI模型在动态高风险环境中的鲁棒性。

Abstract: The advent of adversarial patches poses a significant challenge to the
robustness of AI models, particularly in the domain of computer vision tasks
such as object detection. In contradistinction to traditional adversarial
examples, these patches target specific regions of an image, resulting in the
malfunction of AI models. This paper proposes Incremental Patch Generation
(IPG), a method that generates adversarial patches up to 11.1 times more
efficiently than existing approaches while maintaining comparable attack
performance. The efficacy of IPG is demonstrated by experiments and ablation
studies including YOLO's feature distribution visualization and adversarial
training results, which show that it produces well-generalized patches that
effectively cover a broader range of model vulnerabilities. Furthermore,
IPG-generated datasets can serve as a robust knowledge foundation for
constructing a robust model, enabling structured representation, advanced
reasoning, and proactive defenses in AI security ecosystems. The findings of
this study suggest that IPG has considerable potential for future utilization
not only in adversarial patch defense but also in real-world applications such
as autonomous vehicles, security systems, and medical imaging, where AI models
must remain resilient to adversarial attacks in dynamic and high-stakes
environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索VLMs在无障碍领域的应用潜力，填补其在模拟低视力人群视觉感知方面的研究空白。

Method: 通过调查40名低视力参与者构建数据集，并设计不同提示组合（视觉信息、示例响应）让VLM（GPT-4o）模拟参与者行为。

Result: 仅提供视觉信息或示例响应时，VLM与参与者回答的一致性较低（0.59）；结合两者后一致性显著提高（0.70）。

Conclusion: 结合视觉信息和示例响应能有效提升VLM模拟低视力人群的准确性，但额外示例的增益有限。

Abstract: Advances in vision language models (VLMs) have enabled the simulation of
general human behavior through their reasoning and problem solving
capabilities. However, prior research has not investigated such simulation
capabilities in the accessibility domain. In this paper, we evaluate the extent
to which VLMs can simulate the vision perception of low vision individuals when
interpreting images. We first compile a benchmark dataset through a survey
study with 40 low vision participants, collecting their brief and detailed
vision information and both open-ended and multiple-choice image perception and
recognition responses to up to 25 images. Using these responses, we construct
prompts for VLMs (GPT-4o) to create simulated agents of each participant,
varying the included information on vision information and example image
responses. We evaluate the agreement between VLM-generated responses and
participants' original answers. Our results indicate that VLMs tend to infer
beyond the specified vision ability when given minimal prompts, resulting in
low agreement (0.59). The agreement between the agent' and participants'
responses remains low when only either the vision information (0.59) or example
image responses (0.59) are provided, whereas a combination of both
significantly increase the agreement (0.70, p < 0.0001). Notably, a single
example combining both open-ended and multiple-choice responses, offers
significant performance improvements over either alone (p < 0.0001), while
additional examples provided minimal benefits (p > 0.05).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有医学多模态基准通常局限于单图像、单轮任务，无法反映临床实践中的多模态交互和纵向特性。

Method: MedAtlas引入多轮对话、多模态图像交互、多任务集成和高临床保真度，支持四种核心任务。

Result: 基准测试显示现有模型在多阶段临床推理中存在显著性能差距。

Conclusion: MedAtlas为开发稳健可信的医学AI提供了具有挑战性的评估平台。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence has demonstrated significant potential in clinical
decision-making; however, developing models capable of adapting to diverse
real-world scenarios and performing complex diagnostic reasoning remains a
major challenge. Existing medical multi-modal benchmarks are typically limited
to single-image, single-turn tasks, lacking multi-modal medical image
integration and failing to capture the longitudinal and multi-modal interactive
nature inherent to clinical practice. To address this gap, we introduce
MedAtlas, a novel benchmark framework designed to evaluate large language
models on realistic medical reasoning tasks. MedAtlas is characterized by four
key features: multi-turn dialogue, multi-modal medical image interaction,
multi-task integration, and high clinical fidelity. It supports four core
tasks: open-ended multi-turn question answering, closed-ended multi-turn
question answering, multi-image joint reasoning, and comprehensive disease
diagnosis. Each case is derived from real diagnostic workflows and incorporates
temporal interactions between textual medical histories and multiple imaging
modalities, including CT, MRI, PET, ultrasound, and X-ray, requiring models to
perform deep integrative reasoning across images and clinical texts. MedAtlas
provides expert-annotated gold standards for all tasks. Furthermore, we propose
two novel evaluation metrics: Round Chain Accuracy and Error Propagation
Resistance. Benchmark results with existing multi-modal models reveal
substantial performance gaps in multi-stage clinical reasoning. MedAtlas
establishes a challenging evaluation platform to advance the development of
robust and trustworthy medical AI.

Motivation: 解决临床单壳低角分辨率扩散 MRI 数据生成可靠 FOD 的挑战，并推动深度学习方法在临床中的广泛应用。

Method: 采用加速的端到端深度学习框架 FastFOD-Net，优化 FOD 增强性能，显著提升训练和推理效率。

Conclusion: FastFOD-Net 有望加速临床神经科学研究，提升疾病鉴别能力，并增强深度学习方法在临床中的可信度。

Abstract: Fiber orientation distribution (FOD) is an advanced diffusion MRI modeling
technique that represents complex white matter fiber configurations, and a key
step for subsequent brain tractography and connectome analysis. Its reliability
and accuracy, however, heavily rely on the quality of the MRI acquisition and
the subsequent estimation of the FODs at each voxel. Generating reliable FODs
from widely available clinical protocols with single-shell and
low-angular-resolution acquisitions remains challenging but could potentially
be addressed with recent advances in deep learning-based enhancement
techniques. Despite advancements, existing methods have predominantly been
assessed on healthy subjects, which have proved to be a major hurdle for their
clinical adoption. In this work, we validate a newly optimized enhancement
framework, FastFOD-Net, across healthy controls and six neurological disorders.
This accelerated end-to-end deep learning framework enhancing FODs with
superior performance and delivering training/inference efficiency for clinical
use ($60\times$ faster comparing to its predecessor). With the most
comprehensive clinical evaluation to date, our work demonstrates the potential
of FastFOD-Net in accelerating clinical neuroscience research, empowering
diffusion MRI analysis for disease differentiation, improving interpretability
in connectome applications, and reducing measurement errors to lower sample
size requirements. Critically, this work will facilitate the more widespread
adoption of, and build clinical trust in, deep learning based methods for
diffusion MRI enhancement. Specifically, FastFOD-Net enables robust analysis of
real-world, clinical diffusion MRI data, comparable to that achievable with
high-quality research acquisitions.

Conclusion: 外部工具为MLLMs的发展提供了重要支持，未来需进一步探索其局限性和应用前景。

Abstract: By integrating the perception capabilities of multimodal encoders with the
generative power of Large Language Models (LLMs), Multimodal Large Language
Models (MLLMs), exemplified by GPT-4V, have achieved great success in various
multimodal tasks, pointing toward a promising pathway to artificial general
intelligence. Despite this progress, the limited quality of multimodal data,
poor performance on many complex downstream tasks, and inadequate evaluation
protocols continue to hinder the reliability and broader applicability of MLLMs
across diverse domains. Inspired by the human ability to leverage external
tools for enhanced reasoning and problem-solving, augmenting MLLMs with
external tools (e.g., APIs, expert models, and knowledge bases) offers a
promising strategy to overcome these challenges. In this paper, we present a
comprehensive survey on leveraging external tools to enhance MLLM performance.
Our discussion is structured along four key dimensions about external tools:
(1) how they can facilitate the acquisition and annotation of high-quality
multimodal data; (2) how they can assist in improving MLLM performance on
challenging downstream tasks; (3) how they enable comprehensive and accurate
evaluation of MLLMs; (4) the current limitations and future directions of
tool-augmented MLLMs. Through this survey, we aim to underscore the
transformative potential of external tools in advancing MLLM capabilities,
offering a forward-looking perspective on their development and applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决汽车感知系统在RGB图像中因材料相似性（metamerism）导致的视觉模糊问题，提高VRU的识别安全性。

Method: 结合信息论技术（联合互信息最大化、相关性分析）和图像质量指标（对比信噪比），选择最具信息量的HSI波段。

Result: 在H-City数据集上，选定的三个波段显著提升了VRU与背景的区分度，各项指标优于RGB图像。

Conclusion: 该方法为ADAS和自动驾驶提供了更优的感知输入，有效减少视觉模糊，提升道路安全。

Abstract: Protecting Vulnerable Road Users (VRU) is a critical safety challenge for
automotive perception systems, particularly under visual ambiguity caused by
metamerism, a phenomenon where distinct materials appear similar in RGB
imagery. This work investigates hyperspectral imaging (HSI) to overcome this
limitation by capturing unique material signatures beyond the visible spectrum,
especially in the Near-Infrared (NIR). To manage the inherent
high-dimensionality of HSI data, we propose a band selection strategy that
integrates information theory techniques (joint mutual information
maximization, correlation analysis) with a novel application of an image
quality metric (contrast signal-to-noise ratio) to identify the most spectrally
informative bands. Using the Hyperspectral City V2 (H-City) dataset, we
identify three informative bands (497 nm, 607 nm, and 895 nm, $\pm$27 nm) and
reconstruct pseudo-color images for comparison with co-registered RGB.
Quantitative results demonstrate increased dissimilarity and perceptual
separability of VRU from the background. The selected HSI bands yield
improvements of 70.24%, 528.46%, 1206.83%, and 246.62% for dissimilarity
(Euclidean, SAM, $T^2$) and perception (CIE $\Delta E$) metrics, consistently
outperforming RGB and confirming a marked reduction in metameric confusion. By
providing a spectrally optimized input, our method enhances VRU separability,
establishing a robust foundation for downstream perception tasks in Advanced
Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS) and Autonomous Driving (AD), ultimately
contributing to improved road safety.

TL;DR: EVCtrl是一种轻量级控制适配器，通过时空双缓存策略减少冗余计算，显著提升图像和视频生成效率，无需重新训练模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法如ControlNet虽能实现精确控制，但增加了延迟和冗余计算，尤其在视频生成中问题突出。

Method: 提出时空双缓存策略：空间上分区处理控制信号，时间上选择性跳过冗余去噪步骤。

Result: 在多个数据集上实现2倍以上的速度提升，生成质量几乎无下降。

Conclusion: EVCtrl高效解决了控制生成中的冗余计算问题，适用于图像和视频生成。

Abstract: Visual generation includes both image and video generation, training
probabilistic models to create coherent, diverse, and semantically faithful
content from scratch. While early research focused on unconditional sampling,
practitioners now demand controllable generation that allows precise
specification of layout, pose, motion, or style. While ControlNet grants
precise spatial-temporal control, its auxiliary branch markedly increases
latency and introduces redundant computation in both uncontrolled regions and
denoising steps, especially for video. To address this problem, we introduce
EVCtrl, a lightweight, plug-and-play control adapter that slashes overhead
without retraining the model. Specifically, we propose a spatio-temporal dual
caching strategy for sparse control information. For spatial redundancy, we
first profile how each layer of DiT-ControlNet responds to fine-grained
control, then partition the network into global and local functional zones. A
locality-aware cache focuses computation on the local zones that truly need the
control signal, skipping the bulk of redundant computation in global regions.
For temporal redundancy, we selectively omit unnecessary denoising steps to
improve efficiency. Extensive experiments on CogVideo-Controlnet,
Wan2.1-Controlnet, and Flux demonstrate that our method is effective in image
and video control generation without the need for training. For example, it
achieves 2.16 and 2.05 times speedups on CogVideo-Controlnet and
Wan2.1-Controlnet, respectively, with almost no degradation in generation
quality.Codes are available in the supplementary materials.

Result: 在两个真实数据集上验证，性能显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: MICC方法有效且具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Existing rumor detection methods often neglect the content within images as
well as the inherent relationships between contexts and images across different
visual scales, thereby resulting in the loss of critical information pertinent
to rumor identification. To address these issues, this paper presents a novel
cross-modal rumor detection scheme based on contrastive learning, namely the
Multi-scale Image and Context Correlation exploration algorithm (MICC).
Specifically, we design an SCLIP encoder to generate unified semantic
embeddings for text and multi-scale image patches through contrastive
pretraining, enabling their relevance to be measured via dot-product
similarity. Building upon this, a Cross-Modal Multi-Scale Alignment module is
introduced to identify image regions most relevant to the textual semantics,
guided by mutual information maximization and the information bottleneck
principle, through a Top-K selection strategy based on a cross-modal relevance
matrix constructed between the text and multi-scale image patches. Moreover, a
scale-aware fusion network is designed to integrate the highly correlated
multi-scale image features with global text features by assigning adaptive
weights to image regions based on their semantic importance and cross-modal
relevance. The proposed methodology has been extensively evaluated on two
real-world datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that it achieves a
substantial performance improvement over existing state-of-the-art approaches
in rumor detection, highlighting its effectiveness and potential for practical
applications.

Conclusion: ConstructionSite 10k为研究者提供了训练和评估VLMs的基准，推动了建筑安全检查技术的发展。

Abstract: Construction safety inspections typically involve a human inspector
identifying safety concerns on-site. With the rise of powerful Vision Language
Models (VLMs), researchers are exploring their use for tasks such as detecting
safety rule violations from on-site images. However, there is a lack of open
datasets to comprehensively evaluate and further fine-tune VLMs in construction
safety inspection. Current applications of VLMs use small, supervised datasets,
limiting their applicability in tasks they are not directly trained for. In
this paper, we propose the ConstructionSite 10k, featuring 10,000 construction
site images with annotations for three inter-connected tasks, including image
captioning, safety rule violation visual question answering (VQA), and
construction element visual grounding. Our subsequent evaluation of current
state-of-the-art large pre-trained VLMs shows notable generalization abilities
in zero-shot and few-shot settings, while additional training is needed to make
them applicable to actual construction sites. This dataset allows researchers
to train and evaluate their own VLMs with new architectures and techniques,
providing a valuable benchmark for construction safety inspection.

Abstract: Document fraud poses a significant threat to industries reliant on secure and
verifiable documentation, necessitating robust detection mechanisms. This study
investigates the efficacy of state-of-the-art multi-modal large language models
(LLMs)-including OpenAI O1, OpenAI 4o, Gemini Flash (thinking), Deepseek Janus,
Grok, Llama 3.2 and 4, Qwen 2 and 2.5 VL, Mistral Pixtral, and Claude 3.5 and
3.7 Sonnet-in detecting fraudulent documents. We benchmark these models against
each other and prior work on document fraud detection techniques using a
standard dataset with real transactional documents. Through prompt optimization
and detailed analysis of the models' reasoning processes, we evaluate their
ability to identify subtle indicators of fraud, such as tampered text,
misaligned formatting, and inconsistent transactional sums. Our results reveal
that top-performing multi-modal LLMs demonstrate superior zero-shot
generalization, outperforming conventional methods on out-of-distribution
datasets, while several vision LLMs exhibit inconsistent or subpar performance.
Notably, model size and advanced reasoning capabilities show limited
correlation with detection accuracy, suggesting task-specific fine-tuning is
critical. This study underscores the potential of multi-modal LLMs in enhancing
document fraud detection systems and provides a foundation for future research
into interpretable and scalable fraud mitigation strategies.

Abstract: With the rapid advancement of vision language models(VLM), their ability to
assess visual content based on specific criteria and dimensions has become
increasingly critical for applications such as video-theme consistency
assessment and visual quality scoring. However, existing methods often suffer
from imprecise results and inefficient loss calculation, which limit the focus
of the model on key evaluation indicators. To address this, we propose
IOVQA(Integer-only VQA), a novel fine-tuning approach tailored for VLMs to
enhance their performance in video quality assessment tasks. The key innovation
of IOVQA lies in its label construction and its targeted loss calculation
mechanism. Specifically, during dataset curation, we constrain the model's
output to integers within the range of [10,50], ensuring numerical stability,
and convert decimal Overall_MOS to integer before using them as labels. We also
introduce a target-mask strategy: when computing the loss, only the first
two-digit-integer of the label is unmasked, forcing the model to learn the
critical components of the numerical evaluation. After fine-tuning the
Qwen2.5-VL model using the constructed dataset, experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed method significantly improves the model's
accuracy and consistency in the VQA task, ranking 3rd in VQualA 2025
GenAI-Bench AIGC Video Quality Assessment Challenge -- Track I. Our work
highlights the effectiveness of merely leaving integer labels during
fine-tuning, providing an effective idea for optimizing VLMs in quantitative
evaluation scenarios.

Conclusion: MedSAMix通过自动合并通用与专用模型，有效提升医学图像分割的领域适应性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Universal medical image segmentation models have emerged as a promising
paradigm due to their strong generalizability across diverse tasks, showing
great potential for a wide range of clinical applications. This potential has
been partly driven by the success of general-purpose vision models such as the
Segment Anything Model (SAM), which has inspired the development of various
fine-tuned variants for medical segmentation tasks. However, fine-tuned
variants like MedSAM are trained on comparatively limited medical imaging data
that often suffers from heterogeneity, scarce annotations, and distributional
shifts. These challenges limit their ability to generalize across a wide range
of medical segmentation tasks. In this regard, we propose MedSAMix, a
training-free model merging method that integrates the strengths of both
generalist models (e.g., SAM) and specialist models (e.g., MedSAM) for medical
image segmentation. In contrast to traditional model merging approaches that
rely on manual configuration and often result in suboptimal outcomes, we
propose a zero-order optimization method to automatically discover optimal
layer-wise merging solutions. Furthermore, for clinical applications, we
develop two regimes to meet the demand of domain-specificity and
generalizability in different scenarios by single-task optimization and
multi-objective optimization respectively. Extensive evaluations on 25 medical
segmentation tasks demonstrate that MedSAMix effectively mitigates model bias
and consistently improves performance in both domain-specific accuracy and
generalization, achieving improvements of 6.67% on specialized tasks and 4.37%
on multi-task evaluations.

Motivation: 现有3D视觉语言数据集缺乏多视图和远距离对象的推理能力，限制了模型的深度场景理解能力。

Method: 引入MV-ScanQA数据集和TripAlign预训练语料库，开发LEGO方法，将2D LVLMs知识迁移到3D领域。

Result: LEGO在MV-ScanQA和现有3D密集描述与问答基准上达到最优性能。

Conclusion: MV-ScanQA和TripAlign为3D视觉语言学习提供了更丰富的多视图和多对象对齐信号，推动了该领域的发展。

Abstract: The advancement of 3D vision-language (3D VL) learning is hindered by several
limitations in existing 3D VL datasets: they rarely necessitate reasoning
beyond a close range of objects in single viewpoint, and annotations often link
instructions to single objects, missing richer contextual alignments between
multiple objects. This significantly curtails the development of models capable
of deep, multi-view 3D scene understanding over distant objects. To address
these challenges, we introduce MV-ScanQA, a novel 3D question answering dataset
where 68% of questions explicitly require integrating information from multiple
views (compared to less than 7% in existing datasets), thereby rigorously
testing multi-view compositional reasoning. To facilitate the training of
models for such demanding scenarios, we present TripAlign dataset, a
large-scale and low-cost 2D-3D-language pre-training corpus containing 1M <2D
view, set of 3D objects, text> triplets that explicitly aligns groups of
contextually related objects with text, providing richer, view-grounded
multi-object multimodal alignment signals than previous single-object
annotations. We further develop LEGO, a baseline method for the multi-view
reasoning challenge in MV-ScanQA, transferring knowledge from pre-trained 2D
LVLMs to 3D domain with TripAlign. Empirically, LEGO pre-trained on TripAlign
achieves state-of-the-art performance not only on the proposed MV-ScanQA, but
also on existing benchmarks for 3D dense captioning and question answering.

TL;DR: 研究通过AI分析3D临床影像，发现腹部脂肪分布与2型糖尿病风险相关，且在不同体重群体中表现一致。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管BMI是2型糖尿病的已知风险因素，但瘦人和肥胖者中疾病表现不一，表明详细的身体组成可能揭示腹部表型。

Method: 利用AI从临床CT中提取腹部结构特征，通过随机森林分类和SHAP分析识别糖尿病风险和保护相关的身体组成特征。

Result: 随机森林模型的AUC为0.72-0.74，发现脂肪肌肉、年龄、内脏脂肪等是共享的糖尿病风险因素。

Conclusion: 腹部驱动2型糖尿病的因素在不同体重群体中可能一致。

Abstract: Purpose: Although elevated BMI is a well-known risk factor for type 2
diabetes, the disease's presence in some lean adults and absence in others with
obesity suggests that detailed body composition may uncover abdominal
phenotypes of type 2 diabetes. With AI, we can now extract detailed
measurements of size, shape, and fat content from abdominal structures in 3D
clinical imaging at scale. This creates an opportunity to empirically define
body composition signatures linked to type 2 diabetes risk and protection using
large-scale clinical data. Approach: To uncover BMI-specific diabetic abdominal
patterns from clinical CT, we applied our design four times: once on the full
cohort (n = 1,728) and once on lean (n = 497), overweight (n = 611), and obese
(n = 620) subgroups separately. Briefly, our experimental design transforms
abdominal scans into collections of explainable measurements through
segmentation, classifies type 2 diabetes through a cross-validated random
forest, measures how features contribute to model-estimated risk or protection
through SHAP analysis, groups scans by shared model decision patterns
(clustering from SHAP) and links back to anatomical differences
(classification). Results: The random-forests achieved mean AUCs of 0.72-0.74.
There were shared type 2 diabetes signatures in each group; fatty skeletal
muscle, older age, greater visceral and subcutaneous fat, and a smaller or
fat-laden pancreas. Univariate logistic regression confirmed the direction of
14-18 of the top 20 predictors within each subgroup (p < 0.05). Conclusions:
Our findings suggest that abdominal drivers of type 2 diabetes may be
consistent across weight classes.

TL;DR: HierOctFusion提出了一种基于多尺度八叉树的扩散模型，通过分层特征交互和语义部分信息注入，提升了3D内容生成的精细度和效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将3D对象视为整体，忽略了其语义部分层次结构，且高分辨率建模计算成本高。HierOctFusion旨在解决这些问题。

Method: 采用多尺度八叉树扩散模型，引入跨注意力机制注入部分级信息，并构建带部分类别标注的3D数据集。

Result: 实验表明，HierOctFusion在形状质量和效率上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: HierOctFusion通过分层生成和语义部分建模，显著提升了3D内容生成的效果。

Abstract: 3D content generation remains a fundamental yet challenging task due to the
inherent structural complexity of 3D data. While recent octree-based diffusion
models offer a promising balance between efficiency and quality through
hierarchical generation, they often overlook two key insights: 1) existing
methods typically model 3D objects as holistic entities, ignoring their
semantic part hierarchies and limiting generalization; and 2) holistic
high-resolution modeling is computationally expensive, whereas real-world
objects are inherently sparse and hierarchical, making them well-suited for
layered generation. Motivated by these observations, we propose HierOctFusion,
a part-aware multi-scale octree diffusion model that enhances hierarchical
feature interaction for generating fine-grained and sparse object structures.
Furthermore, we introduce a cross-attention conditioning mechanism that injects
part-level information into the generation process, enabling semantic features
to propagate effectively across hierarchical levels from parts to the whole.
Additionally, we construct a 3D dataset with part category annotations using a
pre-trained segmentation model to facilitate training and evaluation.
Experiments demonstrate that HierOctFusion achieves superior shape quality and
efficiency compared to prior methods.

Motivation: 现有密集视觉感知任务受限于预定义类别，CLIP在开放词汇任务中表现不佳，因其局部特征表示不足。

Method: 提出DeCLIP框架，解耦自注意力模块，分别优化内容和上下文特征，利用视觉基础模型和扩散模型增强特征。

Result: DeCLIP在多种任务（如2D检测、3D分割等）中达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: DeCLIP为开放词汇密集感知任务提供了有效解决方案，性能显著提升。

Abstract: Dense visual perception tasks have been constrained by their reliance on
predefined categories, limiting their applicability in real-world scenarios
where visual concepts are unbounded. While Vision-Language Models (VLMs) like
CLIP have shown promise in open-vocabulary tasks, their direct application to
dense perception often leads to suboptimal performance due to limitations in
local feature representation. In this work, we present our observation that
CLIP's image tokens struggle to effectively aggregate information from
spatially or semantically related regions, resulting in features that lack
local discriminability and spatial consistency. To address this issue, we
propose DeCLIP, a novel framework that enhances CLIP by decoupling the
self-attention module to obtain ``content'' and ``context'' features
respectively. \revise{The context features are enhanced by jointly distilling
semantic correlations from Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) and object integrity
cues from diffusion models, thereby enhancing spatial consistency. In parallel,
the content features are aligned with image crop representations and
constrained by region correlations from VFMs to improve local discriminability.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that DeCLIP establishes a solid foundation
for open-vocabulary dense perception, consistently achieving state-of-the-art
performance across a broad spectrum of tasks, including 2D detection and
segmentation, 3D instance segmentation, video instance segmentation, and 6D
object pose estimation.} Code is available at

Motivation: 现有深度去雾方法仅关注去雾，缺乏雾图和去雾图之间的双向转换能力。

Method: 设计双马尔可夫链处理残差，通过扰动图像和预测噪声学习条件分布，并引入统一评分函数降低计算成本。

Result: RBDM仅需15步采样即可实现雾图和去雾图的无尺寸双向转换，在合成和真实数据集上表现优异。

Conclusion: RBDM在双向转换任务中性能优越，计算效率高，适用于小数据集。

Abstract: Current deep dehazing methods only focus on removing haze from hazy images,
lacking the capability to translate between hazy and haze-free images. To
address this issue, we propose a residual-based efficient bidirectional
diffusion model (RBDM) that can model the conditional distributions for both
dehazing and haze generation. Firstly, we devise dual Markov chains that can
effectively shift the residuals and facilitate bidirectional smooth transitions
between them. Secondly, the RBDM perturbs the hazy and haze-free images at
individual timesteps and predicts the noise in the perturbed data to
simultaneously learn the conditional distributions. Finally, to enhance
performance on relatively small datasets and reduce computational costs, our
method introduces a unified score function learned on image patches instead of
entire images. Our RBDM successfully implements size-agnostic bidirectional
transitions between haze-free and hazy images with only 15 sampling steps.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior or
at least comparable performance to state-of-the-art methods on both synthetic
and real-world datasets.

TL;DR: 该研究探讨了视觉语言模型（VLM）在共享表示空间中如何隐性地编码和放大社会性别刻板印象，并提出了一种评估性别偏见的框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型在图像和文本对齐中可能隐性地强化性别刻板印象，但标准准确性指标无法揭示这一问题。

Method: 通过分析220张人脸照片和150条描述职业与活动的短语的嵌入相似性，计算性别关联分数，并使用置信区间和标签交换模型验证结果。

Result: 研究揭示了对比视觉语言空间中性别关联的详细分布，并提供了评估性别偏见的稳健框架。

Conclusion: 视觉语言模型可能隐性地强化性别刻板印象，需进一步优化以减少偏见。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLM) align images and text in a shared representation
space that is useful for retrieval and zero-shot transfer. Yet, this alignment
can encode and amplify social stereotypes in subtle ways that are not obvious
from standard accuracy metrics. In this study, we test whether the contrastive
vision-language encoder exhibits gender-linked associations when it places
embeddings of face images near embeddings of short phrases that describe
occupations and activities. We assemble a dataset of 220 face photographs split
by perceived binary gender and a set of 150 unique statements distributed
across six categories covering emotional labor, cognitive labor, domestic
labor, technical labor, professional roles, and physical labor. We compute
unit-norm image embeddings for every face and unit-norm text embeddings for
every statement, then define a statement-level association score as the
difference between the mean cosine similarity to the male set and the mean
cosine similarity to the female set, where positive values indicate stronger
association with the male set and negative values indicate stronger association
with the female set. We attach bootstrap confidence intervals by resampling
images within each gender group, aggregate by category with a separate
bootstrap over statements, and run a label-swap null model that estimates the
level of mean absolute association we would expect if no gender structure were
present. The outcome is a statement-wise and category-wise map of gender
associations in a contrastive vision-language space, accompanied by
uncertainty, simple sanity checks, and a robust gender bias evaluation
framework.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在CIR任务中需要额外训练排序模型，且Chain-of-Thought技术应用有限，难以在监督式CIR中取得满意效果。

Method: 结合Pyramid Matching Model和Training-Free Refinement，利用Pyramid Patcher增强视觉信息理解，并从CoT数据中提取表示注入LVLMs。

Result: 在CIR基准测试中，PMTFR表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: PMTFR框架有效解决了监督式CIR任务中的挑战，无需额外训练即可提升性能。

Abstract: Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) presents a significant challenge as it
requires jointly understanding a reference image and a modified textual
instruction to find relevant target images. Some existing methods attempt to
use a two-stage approach to further refine retrieval results. However, this
often requires additional training of a ranking model. Despite the success of
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) techniques in reducing training costs for language
models, their application in CIR tasks remains limited -- compressing visual
information into text or relying on elaborate prompt designs. Besides, existing
works only utilize it for zero-shot CIR, as it is challenging to achieve
satisfactory results in supervised CIR with a well-trained model. In this work,
we proposed a framework that includes the Pyramid Matching Model with
Training-Free Refinement (PMTFR) to address these challenges. Through a simple
but effective module called Pyramid Patcher, we enhanced the Pyramid Matching
Model's understanding of visual information at different granularities.
Inspired by representation engineering, we extracted representations from COT
data and injected them into the LVLMs. This approach allowed us to obtain
refined retrieval scores in the Training-Free Refinement paradigm without
relying on explicit textual reasoning, further enhancing performance. Extensive
experiments on CIR benchmarks demonstrate that PMTFR surpasses state-of-the-art
methods in supervised CIR tasks. The code will be made public.

Conclusion: LEARN是首个结合布局叙事、语义结构学习和认知支架的生成方法，为教育领域的生成AI开辟了新方向。

Abstract: LEARN is a layout-aware diffusion framework designed to generate
pedagogically aligned illustrations for STEM education. It leverages a curated
BookCover dataset that provides narrative layouts and structured visual cues,
enabling the model to depict abstract and sequential scientific concepts with
strong semantic alignment. Through layout-conditioned generation, contrastive
visual-semantic training, and prompt modulation, LEARN produces coherent visual
sequences that support mid-to-high-level reasoning in line with Bloom's
taxonomy while reducing extraneous cognitive load as emphasized by Cognitive
Load Theory. By fostering spatially organized and story-driven narratives, the
framework counters fragmented attention often induced by short-form media and
promotes sustained conceptual focus. Beyond static diagrams, LEARN demonstrates
potential for integration with multimodal systems and curriculum-linked
knowledge graphs to create adaptive, exploratory educational content. As the
first generative approach to unify layout-based storytelling, semantic
structure learning, and cognitive scaffolding, LEARN represents a novel
direction for generative AI in education. The code and dataset will be released
to facilitate future research and practical deployment.

Motivation: 现有去雾方法在处理真实世界厚雾场景时效果不佳，主要原因是缺乏真实配对数据和鲁棒先验。

Method: 采用两阶段学习：第一阶段用EM算法解耦配对图像联合分布，并用布朗桥扩散模型建模；第二阶段利用预训练模型和大规模未配对数据提升性能。还引入了细节增强的RDC模块。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上，EM-B3DM性能优于或至少与现有最佳方法相当。

Conclusion: EM-B3DM为真实世界图像去雾提供了一种高效解决方案，尤其在缺乏配对数据时表现优异。

Abstract: Existing dehazing methods deal with real-world haze images with difficulty,
especially scenes with thick haze. One of the main reasons is the lack of
real-world paired data and robust priors. To avoid the costly collection of
paired hazy and clear images, we propose an efficient semi-supervised image
dehazing method via Expectation-Maximization and Bidirectional Brownian Bridge
Diffusion Models (EM-B3DM) with a two-stage learning scheme. In the first
stage, we employ the EM algorithm to decouple the joint distribution of paired
hazy and clear images into two conditional distributions, which are then
modeled using a unified Brownian Bridge diffusion model to directly capture the
structural and content-related correlations between hazy and clear images. In
the second stage, we leverage the pre-trained model and large-scale unpaired
hazy and clear images to further improve the performance of image dehazing.
Additionally, we introduce a detail-enhanced Residual Difference Convolution
block (RDC) to capture gradient-level information, significantly enhancing the
model's representation capability. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
EM-B3DM achieves superior or at least comparable performance to
state-of-the-art methods on both synthetic and real-world datasets.

Result: VG-DETR在源自由遥感检测任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: VG-DETR通过VFM的语义先验和双级对齐，有效解决了SFOD中的伪标签噪声问题，提升了检测性能。

Abstract: Unsupervised domain adaptation methods have been widely explored to bridge
domain gaps. However, in real-world remote-sensing scenarios, privacy and
transmission constraints often preclude access to source domain data, which
limits their practical applicability. Recently, Source-Free Object Detection
(SFOD) has emerged as a promising alternative, aiming at cross-domain
adaptation without relying on source data, primarily through a self-training
paradigm. Despite its potential, SFOD frequently suffers from training collapse
caused by noisy pseudo-labels, especially in remote sensing imagery with dense
objects and complex backgrounds. Considering that limited target domain
annotations are often feasible in practice, we propose a Vision
foundation-Guided DEtection TRansformer (VG-DETR), built upon a semi-supervised
framework for SFOD in remote sensing images. VG-DETR integrates a Vision
Foundation Model (VFM) into the training pipeline in a "free lunch" manner,
leveraging a small amount of labeled target data to mitigate pseudo-label noise
while improving the detector's feature-extraction capability. Specifically, we
introduce a VFM-guided pseudo-label mining strategy that leverages the VFM's
semantic priors to further assess the reliability of the generated
pseudo-labels. By recovering potentially correct predictions from
low-confidence outputs, our strategy improves pseudo-label quality and
quantity. In addition, a dual-level VFM-guided alignment method is proposed,
which aligns detector features with VFM embeddings at both the instance and
image levels. Through contrastive learning among fine-grained prototypes and
similarity matching between feature maps, this dual-level alignment further
enhances the robustness of feature representations against domain gaps.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that VG-DETR achieves superior performance in
source-free remote sensing detection tasks.

Conclusion: RETFound在视盘分割任务中表现卓越，为基础模型替代任务专用架构提供了有力支持。

Abstract: RETFound is a well-known foundation model (FM) developed for fundus camera
and optical coherence tomography images. It has shown promising performance
across multiple datasets in diagnosing diseases, both eye-specific and
systemic, from retinal images. However, to our best knowledge, it has not been
used for other tasks. We present the first adaptation of RETFound for optic
disc segmentation, a ubiquitous and foundational task in retinal image
analysis. The resulting segmentation system outperforms state-of-the-art,
segmentation-specific baseline networks after training a head with only a very
modest number of task-specific examples. We report and discuss results with
four public datasets, IDRID, Drishti-GS, RIM-ONE-r3, and REFUGE, and a private
dataset, GoDARTS, achieving about 96% Dice consistently across all datasets.
Overall, our method obtains excellent performance in internal verification,
domain generalization and domain adaptation, and exceeds most of the
state-of-the-art baseline results. We discuss the results in the framework of
the debate about FMs as alternatives to task-specific architectures. The code

Motivation: 现有CCD方法难以平衡新类别发现与分类任务，且易累积错误并占用过多存储空间，需改进。

Method: IDOD方法包括独立多样性模块、联合发现模块和正交性模块，分别用于避免特征单一化、减少错误累积和降低存储开销。

Result: 在细粒度数据集上，IDOD方法优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: IDOD方法有效解决了CCD中的关键问题，具有更高的性能和更低的存储需求。

Abstract: Continuous category discovery (CCD) aims to automatically discover novel
categories in continuously arriving unlabeled data. This is a challenging
problem considering that there is no number of categories and labels in the
newly arrived data, while also needing to mitigate catastrophic forgetting.
Most CCD methods cannot handle the contradiction between novel class discovery
and classification well. They are also prone to accumulate errors in the
process of gradually discovering novel classes. Moreover, most of them use
knowledge distillation and data replay to prevent forgetting, occupying more
storage space. To address these limitations, we propose Independence-based
Diversity and Orthogonality-based Discrimination (IDOD). IDOD mainly includes
independent enrichment of diversity module, joint discovery of novelty module,
and continuous increment by orthogonality module. In independent enrichment,
the backbone is trained separately using contrastive loss to avoid it focusing
only on features for classification. Joint discovery transforms multi-stage
novel class discovery into single-stage, reducing error accumulation impact.
Continuous increment by orthogonality module generates mutually orthogonal
prototypes for classification and prevents forgetting with lower space overhead
via representative representation replay. Experimental results show that on
challenging fine-grained datasets, our method outperforms the state-of-the-art
methods.

Motivation: 现有适配器方法在视觉和文本表示对齐时存在不足，无法捕捉类别与图像样本之间的一对多关联，且难以处理未知类别。

Method: 引入可学习的属性提示作为桥梁，将类别、属性和图像投影到双曲空间，并通过层次正则化学习潜在语义层次。

Result: 在四个少样本任务上的实验表明，LatHAdapter优于其他微调方法，尤其在已知类别适应和未知类别泛化方面。

Conclusion: LatHAdapter通过潜在语义层次结构有效提升少样本分类任务的性能。

Abstract: Adapter-based approaches have garnered attention for fine-tuning pre-trained
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) on few-shot classification tasks. These methods
strive to develop a lightweight module that better aligns visual and (category)
textual representations, thereby enhancing performance on downstream few-shot
learning tasks. However, existing adapters generally learn/align (category)
textual-visual modalities via explicit spatial proximity in the underlying
embedding space, which i) fails to capture the inherent one-to-many
associations between categories and image samples and ii) struggles to
establish accurate associations between the unknown categories and images. To
address these issues, inspired by recent works on hyperbolic learning, we
develop a novel Latent Hierarchical Adapter (LatHAdapter) for fine-tuning VLMs
on downstream few-shot classification tasks. The core of LatHAdapter is to
exploit the latent semantic hierarchy of downstream training data and employ it
to provide richer, fine-grained guidance for the adapter learning process.
Specifically, LatHAdapter first introduces some learnable `attribute' prompts
as the bridge to align categories and images. Then, it projects the categories,
attribute prompts, and images within each batch in a hyperbolic space, and
employs hierarchical regularization to learn the latent semantic hierarchy of
them, thereby fully modeling the inherent one-to-many associations among
categories, learnable attributes, and image samples. Extensive experiments on
four challenging few-shot tasks show that the proposed LatHAdapter consistently
outperforms many other fine-tuning approaches, particularly in adapting known
classes and generalizing to unknown classes.

Abstract: Video tokenization procedure is critical for a wide range of video processing
tasks. Most existing approaches directly transform video into fixed-grid and
patch-wise tokens, which exhibit limited versatility. Spatially, uniformly
allocating a fixed number of tokens often leads to over-encoding in
low-information regions. Temporally, reducing redundancy remains challenging
without explicitly distinguishing between static and dynamic content. In this
work, we propose the Gaussian Video Transformer (GVT), a versatile video
tokenizer built upon a generative 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) strategy. We
first extract latent rigid features from a video clip and represent them with a
set of 2D Gaussians generated by our proposed Spatio-Temporal Gaussian
Embedding (STGE) mechanism in a feed-forward manner. Such generative 2D
Gaussians not only enhance spatial adaptability by assigning higher (resp.,
lower) rendering weights to regions with higher (resp., lower) information
content during rasterization, but also improve generalization by avoiding
per-video optimization.To enhance the temporal versatility, we introduce a
Gaussian Set Partitioning (GSP) strategy that separates the 2D Gaussians into
static and dynamic sets, which explicitly model static content shared across
different time-steps and dynamic content specific to each time-step, enabling a
compact representation.We primarily evaluate GVT on the video reconstruction,
while also assessing its performance on action recognition and compression
using the UCF101, Kinetics, and DAVIS datasets. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that GVT achieves a state-of-the-art video reconstruction quality,
outperforms the baseline MAGVIT-v2 in action recognition, and delivers
comparable compression performance.

Motivation: 研究拓扑保持损失函数（如SRL）在管状结构分割中的实际效果，验证其是否如声称的那样优于传统方法。

Method: 通过理论分析SRL的梯度，并在多个管状数据集上比较其与传统基线模型的性能。

Result: 实证表明，SRL的性能并未超过传统基线模型。

Conclusion: 拓扑保持损失函数在复杂管状结构分割中存在局限性，为未来研究提供了重要参考。

Abstract: Image segmentation is an important and widely performed task in computer
vision. Accomplishing effective image segmentation in diverse settings often
requires custom model architectures and loss functions. A set of models that
specialize in segmenting thin tubular structures are topology
preservation-based loss functions. These models often utilize a pixel
skeletonization process claimed to generate more precise segmentation masks of
thin tubes and better capture the structures that other models often miss. One
such model, Skeleton Recall Loss (SRL) proposed by Kirchhoff et al.~\cite
{kirchhoff2024srl}, was stated to produce state-of-the-art results on benchmark
tubular datasets. In this work, we performed a theoretical analysis of the
gradients for the SRL loss. Upon comparing the performance of the proposed
method on some of the tubular datasets (used in the original work, along with
some additional datasets), we found that the performance of SRL-based
segmentation models did not exceed traditional baseline models. By providing
both a theoretical explanation and empirical evidence, this work critically
evaluates the limitations of topology-based loss functions, offering valuable
insights for researchers aiming to develop more effective segmentation models
for complex tubular structures.

Result: CHARM3R在CARLA数据集上对未知相机高度的泛化能力提升了45%以上，达到SOTA性能。

Conclusion: CHARM3R通过优化深度估计，显著提升了单目3D检测器在相机高度变化下的鲁棒性。

Abstract: Monocular 3D object detectors, while effective on data from one ego camera
height, struggle with unseen or out-of-distribution camera heights. Existing
methods often rely on Plucker embeddings, image transformations or data
augmentation. This paper takes a step towards this understudied problem by
first investigating the impact of camera height variations on state-of-the-art
(SoTA) Mono3D models. With a systematic analysis on the extended CARLA dataset
with multiple camera heights, we observe that depth estimation is a primary
factor influencing performance under height variations. We mathematically prove
and also empirically observe consistent negative and positive trends in mean
depth error of regressed and ground-based depth models, respectively, under
camera height changes. To mitigate this, we propose Camera Height Robust
Monocular 3D Detector (CHARM3R), which averages both depth estimates within the
model. CHARM3R improves generalization to unseen camera heights by more than
$45\%$, achieving SoTA performance on the CARLA dataset. Codes and Models at

Abstract: We introduce G-CUT3R, a novel feed-forward approach for guided 3D scene
reconstruction that enhances the CUT3R model by integrating prior information.
Unlike existing feed-forward methods that rely solely on input images, our
method leverages auxiliary data, such as depth, camera calibrations, or camera
positions, commonly available in real-world scenarios. We propose a lightweight
modification to CUT3R, incorporating a dedicated encoder for each modality to
extract features, which are fused with RGB image tokens via zero convolution.
This flexible design enables seamless integration of any combination of prior
information during inference. Evaluated across multiple benchmarks, including
3D reconstruction and other multi-view tasks, our approach demonstrates
significant performance improvements, showing its ability to effectively
utilize available priors while maintaining compatibility with varying input
modalities.

Abstract: Many everyday tasks ranging from fixing appliances, cooking recipes to car

multi-step. Despite growing interest in AI agents, there is a scarcity of
dialogue-video datasets grounded for real world task assistance. In this paper,
we propose a simple yet effective approach that transforms single-person

build HowToDIV, a large-scale dataset containing 507 conversations, 6636
question-answer pairs and 24 hours of videoclips across diverse tasks in
cooking, mechanics, and planting. Each session includes multi-turn conversation
where an expert teaches a novice user how to perform a task step by step, while
observing user's surrounding through a camera and microphone equipped wearable
device. We establish the baseline benchmark performance on HowToDIV dataset
through Gemma-3 model for future research on this new task of dialogues for

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种轻量级视觉语言模型UAV-VL-R1，专为无人机航拍图像设计，通过混合训练方法（SFT和RL）提升性能，并在新数据集HRVQA-VL上验证其优越性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 通用视觉语言模型在无人机航拍图像上性能下降，因其高分辨率、复杂语义和实时性要求，需专门设计模型应对这些挑战。

Method: 采用监督微调（SFT）和多阶段强化学习（RL）的混合方法，结合GRPO算法提升结构化推理能力。

Result: UAV-VL-R1在零样本任务中比基线模型Qwen2-VL-2B-Instruct准确率高48.17%，且内存占用低，适合实时部署。

Conclusion: UAV-VL-R1在航拍图像任务中表现出色，GRPO算法弥补了SFT的不足，模型轻量化适合无人机平台。

Abstract: Recent advances in vision-language models (VLMs) have demonstrated strong
generalization in natural image tasks. However, their performance often
degrades on unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based aerial imagery, which features
high resolution, complex spatial semantics, and strict real-time constraints.
These challenges limit the applicability of general-purpose VLMs to structured
aerial reasoning tasks. To address these challenges, we propose UAV-VL-R1, a
lightweight VLM explicitly designed for aerial visual reasoning. It is trained
using a hybrid method that combines supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and
multi-stage reinforcement learning (RL). We leverage the group relative policy
optimization (GRPO) algorithm to promote structured and interpretable reasoning
through rule-guided rewards and intra-group policy alignment. To support model
training and evaluation, we introduce a high-resolution visual question
answering dataset named HRVQA-VL, which consists of 50,019 annotated samples
covering eight UAV-relevant reasoning tasks, including object counting,
transportation recognition, and spatial scene inference. Experimental results
show that UAV-VL-R1 achieves a 48.17% higher zero-shot accuracy than the
Qwen2-VL-2B-Instruct baseline and even outperforms its 72B-scale variant, which
is 36x larger, on multiple tasks. Ablation studies reveal that while SFT
improves semantic alignment, it may reduce reasoning diversity in mathematical
tasks. GRPO-based RL compensates for this limitation by enhancing logical
flexibility and the robustness of inference. Additionally, UAV-VL-R1 requires
only 3.9GB of memory under FP16 inference and can be quantized to 2.5GB with
INT8, supporting real-time deployment on resource-constrained UAV platforms.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的从粗到细的两阶段知识蒸馏框架，用于轻量级人体姿态估计，通过挖掘关节结构信息和渐进式图卷积网络提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的人体姿态估计方法需要大量计算资源，而传统知识蒸馏未充分利用关节上下文信息，因此提出新框架以提升轻量模型的准确性。

Method: 两阶段知识蒸馏：第一阶段通过关节结构损失挖掘语义信息；第二阶段利用渐进式图卷积网络（IGP-GCN）细化初始姿态。

Result: 在COCO keypoint和CrowdPose数据集上表现优异，尤其在复杂场景下性能提升显著。

Conclusion: 提出的框架有效提升了轻量模型的姿态估计性能，尤其在复杂场景中表现突出。

Abstract: Human pose estimation has been widely applied in the human-centric
understanding and generation, but most existing state-of-the-art human pose
estimation methods require heavy computational resources for accurate
predictions. In order to obtain an accurate, robust yet lightweight human pose
estimator, one feasible way is to transfer pose knowledge from a powerful
teacher model to a less-parameterized student model by knowledge distillation.
However, the traditional knowledge distillation framework does not fully
explore the contextual information among human joints. Thus, in this paper, we
propose a novel coarse-to-fine two-stage knowledge distillation framework for
human pose estimation. In the first-stage distillation, we introduce the human
joints structure loss to mine the structural information among human joints so
as to transfer high-level semantic knowledge from the teacher model to the
student model. In the second-stage distillation, we utilize an Image-Guided
Progressive Graph Convolutional Network (IGP-GCN) to refine the initial human
pose obtained from the first-stage distillation and supervise the training of
the IGP-GCN in the progressive way by the final output pose of teacher model.
The extensive experiments on the benchmark dataset: COCO keypoint and CrowdPose
datasets, show that our proposed method performs favorably against lots of the
existing state-of-the-art human pose estimation methods, especially for the
more complex CrowdPose dataset, the performance improvement of our model is
more significant.

Result: 创建了一个大型购物中心视频数据集，并开发了Android应用，代码和数据公开。

Conclusion: 该方法仅依赖视觉输入，简化了部署，适合实际应用。

Abstract: Indoor navigation is a difficult task, as it generally comes with poor GPS
access, forcing solutions to rely on other sources of information. While
significant progress continues to be made in this area, deployment to
production applications is still lacking, given the complexity and additional
requirements of current solutions. Here, we introduce an efficient, real-time
and easily deployable deep learning approach, based on visual input only, that
can predict the direction towards a target from images captured by a mobile
device. Our technical approach, based on a novel graph-based path generation
method, combined with explainable data augmentation and curriculum learning,
includes contributions that make the process of data collection, annotation and
training, as automatic as possible, efficient and robust. On the practical
side, we introduce a novel largescale dataset, with video footage inside a
relatively large shopping mall, in which each frame is annotated with the
correct next direction towards different specific target destinations.
Different from current methods, ours relies solely on vision, avoiding the need
of special sensors, additional markers placed along the path, knowledge of the
scene map or internet access. We also created an easy to use application for
Android, which we plan to make publicly available. We make all our data and
code available along with visual demos on our project site

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种轻量级不确定性模态建模（UMM）框架，用于解决行人重识别（ReID）中多模态输入不确定或缺失的问题，结合了多模态令牌映射、合成模态增强和跨模态交互学习，提升了鲁棒性和计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在自动驾驶等场景中，行人重识别需要处理多模态输入（如RGB、红外、文本等）的不确定性或缺失，现有方法计算开销大，难以实际部署。

Method: 提出UMM框架，包括多模态令牌映射器、合成模态增强策略和跨模态交互学习器，结合CLIP的视觉-语言对齐能力，高效融合多模态输入。

Result: 实验表明，UMM在模态不确定条件下具有强鲁棒性、泛化能力和计算效率。

Conclusion: UMM为自动驾驶中的行人重识别提供了一种可扩展且实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Re-Identification (ReID) is a critical technology in intelligent perception
systems, especially within autonomous driving, where onboard cameras must
identify pedestrians across views and time in real-time to support safe
navigation and trajectory prediction. However, the presence of uncertain or
missing input modalities--such as RGB, infrared, sketches, or textual
descriptions--poses significant challenges to conventional ReID approaches.
While large-scale pre-trained models offer strong multimodal semantic modeling
capabilities, their computational overhead limits practical deployment in
resource-constrained environments. To address these challenges, we propose a
lightweight Uncertainty Modal Modeling (UMM) framework, which integrates a
multimodal token mapper, synthetic modality augmentation strategy, and
cross-modal cue interactive learner. Together, these components enable unified
feature representation, mitigate the impact of missing modalities, and extract
complementary information across different data types. Additionally, UMM
leverages CLIP's vision-language alignment ability to fuse multimodal inputs
efficiently without extensive finetuning. Experimental results demonstrate that
UMM achieves strong robustness, generalization, and computational efficiency
under uncertain modality conditions, offering a scalable and practical solution
for pedestrian re-identification in autonomous driving scenarios.

Motivation: 历史手写文本识别（HTR）对档案文献的文化和学术价值至关重要，但稀缺的转录、语言变异和多样化的手写风格阻碍了数字化进程。

Method: 采用TrOCR模型，结合图像预处理和四种新型数据增强方法，并评估集成学习策略。

Conclusion: 领域特定的数据增强和集成策略显著提升了历史手稿的HTR性能。

Abstract: Historical handwritten text recognition (HTR) is essential for unlocking the
cultural and scholarly value of archival documents, yet digitization is often
hindered by scarce transcriptions, linguistic variation, and highly diverse
handwriting styles. In this study, we apply TrOCR, a state-of-the-art
transformer-based HTR model, to 16th-century Latin manuscripts authored by
Rudolf Gwalther. We investigate targeted image preprocessing and a broad suite
of data augmentation techniques, introducing four novel augmentation methods
designed specifically for historical handwriting characteristics. We also
evaluate ensemble learning approaches to leverage the complementary strengths
of augmentation-trained models. On the Gwalther dataset, our best single-model
augmentation (Elastic) achieves a Character Error Rate (CER) of 1.86, while a
top-5 voting ensemble achieves a CER of 1.60 - representing a 50% relative
improvement over the best reported TrOCR_BASE result and a 42% improvement over
the previous state of the art. These results highlight the impact of
domain-specific augmentations and ensemble strategies in advancing HTR
performance for historical manuscripts.

Method: 引入Talking-Critic学习人类对齐的奖励函数，构建Talking-NSQ数据集，并提出TLPO框架优化扩散模型。

Result: Talking-Critic在人类偏好评分上显著优于现有方法，TLPO在唇同步、动作自然性和视觉质量上均有提升。

Conclusion: Talking-Critic和TLPO有效解决了多维偏好对齐问题，并在实验中表现出色。

Abstract: Recent advances in audio-driven portrait animation have demonstrated
impressive capabilities. However, existing methods struggle to align with
fine-grained human preferences across multiple dimensions, such as motion
naturalness, lip-sync accuracy, and visual quality. This is due to the
difficulty of optimizing among competing preference objectives, which often
conflict with one another, and the scarcity of large-scale, high-quality
datasets with multidimensional preference annotations. To address these, we
first introduce Talking-Critic, a multimodal reward model that learns
human-aligned reward functions to quantify how well generated videos satisfy
multidimensional expectations. Leveraging this model, we curate Talking-NSQ, a
large-scale multidimensional human preference dataset containing 410K
preference pairs. Finally, we propose Timestep-Layer adaptive multi-expert
Preference Optimization (TLPO), a novel framework for aligning diffusion-based
portrait animation models with fine-grained, multidimensional preferences. TLPO
decouples preferences into specialized expert modules, which are then fused
across timesteps and network layers, enabling comprehensive, fine-grained
enhancement across all dimensions without mutual interference. Experiments
demonstrate that Talking-Critic significantly outperforms existing methods in
aligning with human preference ratings. Meanwhile, TLPO achieves substantial
improvements over baseline models in lip-sync accuracy, motion naturalness, and
visual quality, exhibiting superior performance in both qualitative and
quantitative evaluations. Ours project page:

Conclusion: 该方法为MLLMs的推理过程提供了灵活的控制手段，同时提升了视觉定位能力。

Abstract: As Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) gain widespread applicability, it
is becoming increasingly desirable to adapt them for diverse user needs. In
this paper, we study the adaptation of MLLMs through controlled decoding. To
achieve this, we introduce the first method for reward-guided decoding of MLLMs
and demonstrate its application in improving their visual grounding. Our method
involves building reward models for visual grounding and using them to guide
the MLLM's decoding process. Concretely, we build two separate reward models to
independently control the degree of object precision and recall in the model's
output. Our approach enables on-the-fly controllability of an MLLM's inference
process in two ways: first, by giving control over the relative importance of
each reward function during decoding, allowing a user to dynamically trade off
object precision for recall in image captioning tasks; second, by giving
control over the breadth of the search during decoding, allowing the user to
control the trade-off between the amount of test-time compute and the degree of
visual grounding. We evaluate our method on standard object hallucination
benchmarks, showing that it provides significant controllability over MLLM
inference, while consistently outperforming existing hallucination mitigation
methods.

Result: 实验证明该方法在领域泛化点云分割任务中具有竞争力，分割精度优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 通过类别级几何学习和几何一致对齐，显著提升了3D语义分割模型的领域泛化能力。

Abstract: Domain generalization in 3D segmentation is a critical challenge in deploying
models to unseen environments. Current methods mitigate the domain shift by
augmenting the data distribution of point clouds. However, the model learns
global geometric patterns in point clouds while ignoring the category-level
distribution and alignment. In this paper, a category-level geometry learning
framework is proposed to explore the domain-invariant geometric features for
domain generalized 3D semantic segmentation. Specifically, Category-level
Geometry Embedding (CGE) is proposed to perceive the fine-grained geometric
properties of point cloud features, which constructs the geometric properties
of each class and couples geometric embedding to semantic learning. Secondly,
Geometric Consistent Learning (GCL) is proposed to simulate the latent 3D
distribution and align the category-level geometric embeddings, allowing the
model to focus on the geometric invariant information to improve
generalization. Experimental results verify the effectiveness of the proposed
method, which has very competitive segmentation accuracy compared with the
state-of-the-art domain generalized point cloud methods.

Abstract: Mammogram visual question answering (VQA) integrates image interpretation
with clinical reasoning and has potential to support breast cancer screening.
We systematically evaluated the GPT-5 family and GPT-4o model on four public
mammography datasets (EMBED, InBreast, CMMD, CBIS-DDSM) for BI-RADS assessment,
abnormality detection, and malignancy classification tasks. GPT-5 consistently
was the best performing model but lagged behind both human experts and
domain-specific fine-tuned models. On EMBED, GPT-5 achieved the highest scores
among GPT variants in density (56.8%), distortion (52.5%), mass (64.5%),
calcification (63.5%), and malignancy (52.8%) classification. On InBreast, it
attained 36.9% BI-RADS accuracy, 45.9% abnormality detection, and 35.0%
malignancy classification. On CMMD, GPT-5 reached 32.3% abnormality detection
and 55.0% malignancy accuracy. On CBIS-DDSM, it achieved 69.3% BI-RADS
accuracy, 66.0% abnormality detection, and 58.2% malignancy accuracy. Compared
with human expert estimations, GPT-5 exhibited lower sensitivity (63.5%) and
specificity (52.3%). While GPT-5 exhibits promising capabilities for screening
tasks, its performance remains insufficient for high-stakes clinical imaging
applications without targeted domain adaptation and optimization. However, the
tremendous improvements in performance from GPT-4o to GPT-5 show a promising
trend in the potential for general large language models (LLMs) to assist with
mammography VQA tasks.

Result: SAE特征具有语义意义，提升分布外泛化能力，并支持可控生成。在视觉嵌入模型中可用于OOD检测，扩散模型中支持语义控制，多模态LLMs中揭示跨模态共享表示。

Conclusion: SAEs在视觉模型中具有重要潜力，为提升可解释性、泛化能力和可控性提供了基础。

Abstract: Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) have emerged as a popular tool for interpreting
the hidden states of large language models (LLMs). By learning to reconstruct
activations from a sparse bottleneck layer, SAEs discover interpretable
features from the high-dimensional internal representations of LLMs. Despite
their popularity with language models, SAEs remain understudied in the visual
domain. In this work, we provide an extensive evaluation the representational
power of SAEs for vision models using a broad range of image-based tasks. Our
experimental results demonstrate that SAE features are semantically meaningful,
improve out-of-distribution generalization, and enable controllable generation
across three vision model architectures: vision embedding models, multi-modal
LMMs and diffusion models. In vision embedding models, we find that learned SAE
features can be used for OOD detection and provide evidence that they recover
the ontological structure of the underlying model. For diffusion models, we
demonstrate that SAEs enable semantic steering through text encoder
manipulation and develop an automated pipeline for discovering
human-interpretable attributes. Finally, we conduct exploratory experiments on
multi-modal LLMs, finding evidence that SAE features reveal shared
representations across vision and language modalities. Our study provides a
foundation for SAE evaluation in vision models, highlighting their strong
potential improving interpretability, generalization, and steerability in the
visual domain.

TL;DR: 提出了一种统一框架，结合尺度感知深度预测和时间约束感知细化，用于单目内窥镜组织重建，解决了深度模糊、组织变形等问题。


<details>

Motivation: 单目内窥镜姿态估计和组织重建面临深度模糊、组织变形、运动不一致等挑战，需提升导航和空间感知能力。

Method: 框架包含MAPIS-Depth模块（结合Depth Pro和Depth Anything）和WEMA-RTDL模块，通过RAFT计算像素对应关系，LPIPS感知相似性优化，最终提取3D表面网格。

Conclusion: 该框架通过多模块协同，显著提升了单目内窥镜重建的准确性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Accurate endoscope pose estimation and 3D tissue surface reconstruction
significantly enhances monocular minimally invasive surgical procedures by
enabling accurate navigation and improved spatial awareness. However, monocular
endoscope pose estimation and tissue reconstruction face persistent challenges,
including depth ambiguity, physiological tissue deformation, inconsistent
endoscope motion, limited texture fidelity, and a restricted field of view. To
overcome these limitations, a unified framework for monocular endoscopic tissue
reconstruction that integrates scale-aware depth prediction with
temporally-constrained perceptual refinement is presented. This framework
incorporates a novel MAPIS-Depth module, which leverages Depth Pro for robust
initialisation and Depth Anything for efficient per-frame depth prediction, in
conjunction with L-BFGS-B optimisation, to generate pseudo-metric depth
estimates. These estimates are temporally refined by computing pixel
correspondences using RAFT and adaptively blending flow-warped frames based on
LPIPS perceptual similarity, thereby reducing artefacts arising from
physiological tissue deformation and motion. To ensure accurate registration of
the synthesised pseudo-RGBD frames from MAPIS-Depth, a novel WEMA-RTDL module
is integrated, optimising both rotation and translation. Finally, truncated
signed distance function-based volumetric fusion and marching cubes are applied
to extract a comprehensive 3D surface mesh. Evaluations on HEVD and SCARED,
with ablation and comparative analyses, demonstrate the framework's robustness
and superiority over state-of-the-art methods.

Result: 实验表明，TimeMachine在精细年龄编辑和身份一致性保持方面达到最优性能。

Conclusion: TimeMachine为面部年龄编辑提供了一种高效且可控的解决方案。

Abstract: With the advancement of generative models, facial image editing has made
significant progress. However, achieving fine-grained age editing while
preserving personal identity remains a challenging task.In this paper, we
propose TimeMachine, a novel diffusion-based framework that achieves accurate
age editing while keeping identity features unchanged. To enable fine-grained
age editing, we inject high-precision age information into the multi-cross
attention module, which explicitly separates age-related and identity-related
features. This design facilitates more accurate disentanglement of age
attributes, thereby allowing precise and controllable manipulation of facial
aging.Furthermore, we propose an Age Classifier Guidance (ACG) module that
predicts age directly in the latent space, instead of performing denoising
image reconstruction during training. By employing a lightweight module to
incorporate age constraints, this design enhances age editing accuracy by
modest increasing training cost. Additionally, to address the lack of
large-scale, high-quality facial age datasets, we construct a HFFA dataset
(High-quality Fine-grained Facial-Age dataset) which contains one million
high-resolution images labeled with identity and facial attributes.
Experimental results demonstrate that TimeMachine achieves state-of-the-art
performance in fine-grained age editing while preserving identity consistency.

Motivation: 解决RGB成像中行人与背景难以区分的问题，提升自动驾驶系统的安全性。

Method: 使用H-City数据集，将128通道HSI数据降维为3通道（PCA和CSNR-JMIM），并评估了三种语义分割模型（U-Net、DeepLabV3+、SegFormer）。

Result: CSNR-JMIM在行人分割中平均IoU提升1.44%，F1-score提升2.18%；骑行者分割也有类似提升。

Conclusion: 优化HSI波段选择能显著提升行人分割性能，对安全关键型自动驾驶应用具有潜力。

Abstract: Pedestrian segmentation in automotive perception systems faces critical
safety challenges due to metamerism in RGB imaging, where pedestrians and
backgrounds appear visually indistinguishable.. This study investigates the
potential of hyperspectral imaging (HSI) for enhanced pedestrian segmentation
in urban driving scenarios using the Hyperspectral City v2 (H-City) dataset. We
compared standard RGB against two dimensionality-reduction approaches by
converting 128-channel HSI data into three-channel representations: Principal
Component Analysis (PCA) and optimal band selection using Contrast
Signal-to-Noise Ratio with Joint Mutual Information Maximization (CSNR-JMIM).
Three semantic segmentation models were evaluated: U-Net, DeepLabV3+, and
SegFormer. CSNR-JMIM consistently outperformed RGB with an average improvements
of 1.44% in Intersection over Union (IoU) and 2.18% in F1-score for pedestrian
segmentation. Rider segmentation showed similar gains with 1.43% IoU and 2.25%
F1-score improvements. These improved performance results from enhanced
spectral discrimination of optimally selected HSI bands effectively reducing
false positives. This study demonstrates robust pedestrian segmentation through
optimal HSI band selection, showing significant potential for safety-critical
automotive applications.

Motivation: 现有方法编码所有视频片段（包括无关片段），破坏了多模态对齐并阻碍优化。

Method: 采用去噪后检索范式，包含文本条件去噪（TCD）和文本重构反馈（TRF）模块。TCD动态识别噪声片段并生成噪声掩码，TRF进一步对齐文本与视频表示。

Result: 在Charades-STA和QVHighlights数据集上，性能超越现有方法。

Conclusion: 去噪后检索范式具有适应性，可无缝集成到其他VMR模型中提升性能。

Abstract: Current text-driven Video Moment Retrieval (VMR) methods encode all video
clips, including irrelevant ones, disrupting multimodal alignment and hindering
optimization. To this end, we propose a denoise-then-retrieve paradigm that
explicitly filters text-irrelevant clips from videos and then retrieves the
target moment using purified multimodal representations. Following this
paradigm, we introduce the Denoise-then-Retrieve Network (DRNet), comprising
Text-Conditioned Denoising (TCD) and Text-Reconstruction Feedback (TRF)
modules. TCD integrates cross-attention and structured state space blocks to
dynamically identify noisy clips and produce a noise mask to purify multimodal
video representations. TRF further distills a single query embedding from
purified video representations and aligns it with the text embedding, serving
as auxiliary supervision for denoising during training. Finally, we perform
conditional retrieval using text embeddings on purified video representations
for accurate VMR. Experiments on Charades-STA and QVHighlights demonstrate that
our approach surpasses state-of-the-art methods on all metrics. Furthermore,
our denoise-then-retrieve paradigm is adaptable and can be seamlessly
integrated into advanced VMR models to boost performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型（如CLIP）在逻辑理解方面存在显著缺陷，限制了其在实际应用中的可靠性。

Method: 通过LogicBench（包含50,000多个视觉语言对）评估现有VLMs的逻辑能力，并提出LogicCLIP框架，结合逻辑感知数据生成和对比学习策略。

Result: LogicCLIP在所有LogicBench领域显著提升了逻辑理解能力，同时保持了通用视觉语言任务的竞争力。

Conclusion: LogicBench和LogicCLIP为提升VLMs的逻辑能力提供了重要资源，且不会牺牲通用对齐性能。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs), exemplified by CLIP, have emerged as
foundational for multimodal intelligence. However, their capacity for logical
understanding remains significantly underexplored, resulting in critical
''logical blindspots'' that limit their reliability in practical applications.
To systematically diagnose this, we introduce LogicBench, a comprehensive
benchmark with over 50,000 vision-language pairs across 9 logical categories
and 4 diverse scenarios: images, videos, anomaly detection, and medical
diagnostics. Our evaluation reveals that existing VLMs, even the
state-of-the-art ones, fall at over 40 accuracy points below human performance,
particularly in challenging tasks like Causality and Conditionality,
highlighting their reliance on surface semantics over critical logical
structures. To bridge this gap, we propose LogicCLIP, a novel training
framework designed to boost VLMs' logical sensitivity through advancements in
both data generation and optimization objectives. LogicCLIP utilizes
logic-aware data generation and a contrastive learning strategy that combines
coarse-grained alignment, a fine-grained multiple-choice objective, and a novel
logical structure-aware objective. Extensive experiments demonstrate
LogicCLIP's substantial improvements in logical comprehension across all
LogicBench domains, significantly outperforming baselines. Moreover, LogicCLIP
retains, and often surpasses, competitive performance on general
vision-language benchmarks, demonstrating that the enhanced logical
understanding does not come at the expense of general alignment. We believe
that LogicBench and LogicCLIP will be important resources for advancing VLM
logical capabilities.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于单目标运动建模的方法在拥挤场景或检测不准确时表现不佳，忽视了物体间的几何关系，需要利用空间线索。

Method: 设计了基于点对特征（PPF）的时空编码器，引入线索一致性变换模块对齐特征，并采用动态更新机制保持时空信息。

Result: 在nuScenes和Waymo数据集上验证了方法的有效性，nuScenes测试集AMOTA达到70.3%。

Conclusion: DSC-Track通过关注稳定的空间模式，显著提升了复杂场景下的3D多目标跟踪性能。

Abstract: 3D multi-object tracking is a critical and challenging task in the field of
autonomous driving. A common paradigm relies on modeling individual object
motion, e.g., Kalman filters, to predict trajectories. While effective in
simple scenarios, this approach often struggles in crowded environments or with
inaccurate detections, as it overlooks the rich geometric relationships between
objects. This highlights the need to leverage spatial cues. However, existing
geometry-aware methods can be susceptible to interference from irrelevant
objects, leading to ambiguous features and incorrect associations. To address
this, we propose focusing on cue-consistency: identifying and matching stable
spatial patterns over time. We introduce the Dynamic Scene Cue-Consistency
Tracker (DSC-Track) to implement this principle. Firstly, we design a unified
spatiotemporal encoder using Point Pair Features (PPF) to learn discriminative
trajectory embeddings while suppressing interference. Secondly, our
cue-consistency transformer module explicitly aligns consistent feature
representations between historical tracks and current detections. Finally, a
dynamic update mechanism preserves salient spatiotemporal information for
stable online tracking. Extensive experiments on the nuScenes and Waymo Open
Datasets validate the effectiveness and robustness of our approach. On the
nuScenes benchmark, for instance, our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance, reaching 73.2% and 70.3% AMOTA on the validation and test sets,
respectively.

Motivation: 现有的扩散分类器（DC）存在噪声不稳定性问题，需要大量噪声采样以稳定性能，导致分类速度下降。本文旨在找到一种方法，通过优化噪声来解决这一问题。

Method: 提出NoOp方法，包括频率匹配（优化数据集特定噪声）和空间匹配（训练Meta-Network生成图像特定噪声偏移），以替代随机噪声。

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验表明，NoOp能有效提升扩散分类器的稳定性和性能。

Conclusion: NoOp通过优化噪声解决了DC的噪声不稳定性问题，显著提高了分类速度和准确性。

Abstract: Although today's pretrained discriminative vision-language models (e.g.,
CLIP) have demonstrated strong perception abilities, such as zero-shot image
classification, they also suffer from the bag-of-words problem and spurious
bias. To mitigate these problems, some pioneering studies leverage powerful
generative models (e.g., pretrained diffusion models) to realize generalizable
image classification, dubbed Diffusion Classifier (DC). Specifically, by
randomly sampling a Gaussian noise, DC utilizes the differences of denoising
effects with different category conditions to classify categories.
Unfortunately, an inherent and notorious weakness of existing DCs is noise
instability: different random sampled noises lead to significant performance
changes. To achieve stable classification performance, existing DCs always
ensemble the results of hundreds of sampled noises, which significantly reduces
the classification speed. To this end, we firstly explore the role of noise in
DC, and conclude that: there are some ``good noises'' that can relieve the
instability. Meanwhile, we argue that these good noises should meet two
principles: Frequency Matching and Spatial Matching. Regarding both principles,
we propose a novel Noise Optimization method to learn matching (i.e., good)
noise for DCs: NoOp. For frequency matching, NoOp first optimizes a
dataset-specific noise: Given a dataset and a timestep t, optimize one randomly
initialized parameterized noise. For Spatial Matching, NoOp trains a
Meta-Network that adopts an image as input and outputs image-specific noise
offset. The sum of optimized noise and noise offset will be used in DC to
replace random noise. Extensive ablations on various datasets demonstrated the
effectiveness of NoOp.

Result: AdaFace在减少组间TPR差异方面表现最佳（降低60%），光照是剩余偏见的主要因素（占42%）。

Conclusion: GANDiff FR为公平性审计提供了一个可重复、符合法规的标准，支持透明和可扩展的偏见评估。

Abstract: We introduce GANDiff FR, the first synthetic framework that precisely
controls demographic and environmental factors to measure, explain, and reduce
bias with reproducible rigor. GANDiff FR unifies StyleGAN3-based
identity-preserving generation with diffusion-based attribute control, enabling
fine-grained manipulation of pose around 30 degrees, illumination (four
directions), and expression (five levels) under ceteris paribus conditions. We
synthesize 10,000 demographically balanced faces across five cohorts validated
for realism via automated detection (98.2%) and human review (89%) to isolate
and quantify bias drivers. Benchmarking ArcFace, CosFace, and AdaFace under
matched operating points shows AdaFace reduces inter-group TPR disparity by 60%
(2.5% vs. 6.3%), with illumination accounting for 42% of residual bias.
Cross-dataset evaluation on RFW, BUPT, and CASIA WebFace confirms strong
synthetic-to-real transfer (r 0.85). Despite around 20% computational overhead
relative to pure GANs, GANDiff FR yields three times more attribute-conditioned
variants, establishing a reproducible, regulation-aligned (EU AI Act) standard
for fairness auditing. Code and data are released to support transparent,
scalable bias evaluation.

Method: 提出IAQD方法，通过索引对齐的方式建立查询对应关系，并仅对关键查询进行蒸馏，避免干扰新类别的学习。

Result: 实验表明，IAQD显著减少了知识遗忘，并在多个基准测试中取得了最优性能。

Conclusion: IAQD是一种有效的蒸馏方法，能够在不干扰新类别学习的情况下保留旧类别的知识。

Abstract: Incremental object detection (IOD) aims to continuously expand the capability
of a model to detect novel categories while preserving its performance on
previously learned ones. When adopting a transformer-based detection model to
perform IOD, catastrophic knowledge forgetting may inevitably occur, meaning
the detection performance on previously learned categories may severely
degenerate. Previous typical methods mainly rely on knowledge distillation (KD)
to mitigate the catastrophic knowledge forgetting of transformer-based
detection models. Specifically, they utilize Hungarian Matching to build a
correspondence between the queries of the last-phase and current-phase
detection models and align the classifier and regressor outputs between matched
queries to avoid knowledge forgetting. However, we observe that in IOD task,
Hungarian Matching is not a good choice. With Hungarian Matching, the query of
the current-phase model may match different queries of the last-phase model at
different iterations during KD. As a result, the knowledge encoded in each
query may be reshaped towards new categories, leading to the forgetting of
previously encoded knowledge of old categories. Based on our observations, we
propose a new distillation approach named Index-Aligned Query Distillation
(IAQD) for transformer-based IOD. Beyond using Hungarian Matching, IAQD
establishes a correspondence between queries of the previous and current phase
models that have the same index. Moreover, we perform index-aligned
distillation only on partial queries which are critical for the detection of
previous categories. In this way, IAQD largely preserves the previous semantic
and spatial encoding capabilities without interfering with the learning of new
categories. Extensive experiments on representative benchmarks demonstrate that
IAQD effectively mitigates knowledge forgetting, achieving new state-of-the-art
performance.

Abstract: Information on the number and category of cervical cells is crucial for the
diagnosis of cervical cancer. However, existing classification methods capable
of automatically measuring this information require the training dataset to be
representative, which consumes an expensive or even unaffordable human cost. We
herein propose active labeling that enables us to construct a representative
training dataset using a much smaller human cost for data-efficient cervical
cell classification. This cost-effective method efficiently leverages the
classifier's uncertainty on the unlabeled cervical cell images to accurately
select images that are most beneficial to label. With a fast estimation of the
uncertainty, this new algorithm exhibits its validity and effectiveness in
enhancing the representative ability of the constructed training dataset. The
extensive empirical results confirm its efficacy again in navigating the usage
of human cost, opening the avenue for data-efficient cervical cell
classification.

Abstract: In targeted adversarial attacks on vision models, the selection of the target
label is a critical yet often overlooked determinant of attack success. This
target label corresponds to the class that the attacker aims to force the model
to predict. Now, existing strategies typically rely on randomness, model
predictions, or static semantic resources, limiting interpretability,
reproducibility, or flexibility. This paper then proposes a semantics-guided
framework for adversarial target selection using the cross-modal knowledge
transfer from pretrained language and vision-language models. We evaluate
several state-of-the-art models (BERT, TinyLLAMA, and CLIP) as similarity
sources to select the most and least semantically related labels with respect
to the ground truth, forming best- and worst-case adversarial scenarios. Our
experiments on three vision models and five attack methods reveal that these
models consistently render practical adversarial targets and surpass static
lexical databases, such as WordNet, particularly for distant class
relationships. We also observe that static testing of target labels offers a
preliminary assessment of the effectiveness of similarity sources, \textit{a
priori} testing. Our results corroborate the suitability of pretrained models
for constructing interpretable, standardized, and scalable adversarial
benchmarks across architectures and datasets.

Result: 在HOI检测基准上达到最优性能，并在开放世界泛化中优于现有方法。

Conclusion: HOID-R1通过多模态对齐和减少幻觉，显著提升了人-物交互检测的效果。

Abstract: Understanding and recognizing human-object interaction (HOI) is a pivotal
application in AR/VR and robotics. Recent open-vocabulary HOI detection
approaches depend exclusively on large language models for richer textual
prompts, neglecting their inherent 3D spatial understanding capabilities. To
address this shortcoming, we introduce HOID-R1, the first HOI detection
framework that integrates chain-of-thought (CoT) guided supervised fine-tuning
(SFT) with group relative policy optimization (GRPO) within a reinforcement
learning (RL) paradigm. Specifically, we initially apply SFT to imbue the model
with essential reasoning capabilities, forcing the model to articulate its
thought process in the output. Subsequently, we integrate GRPO to leverage
multi-reward signals for policy optimization, thereby enhancing alignment
across diverse modalities. To mitigate hallucinations in the CoT reasoning, we
introduce an "MLLM-as-a-judge" mechanism that supervises the CoT outputs,
further improving generalization. Extensive experiments show that HOID-R1
achieves state-of-the-art performance on HOI detection benchmarks and
outperforms existing methods in open-world generalization to novel scenarios.

Abstract: Knowledge Distillation is crucial for optimizing face recognition models for
deployment in computationally limited settings, such as edge devices.
Traditional KD methods, such as Raw L2 Feature Distillation or Feature
Consistency loss, often fail to capture both fine-grained instance-level
details and complex relational structures, leading to suboptimal performance.
We propose a unified approach that integrates two novel loss functions,
Instance-Level Embedding Distillation and Relation-Based Pairwise Similarity
Distillation. Instance-Level Embedding Distillation focuses on aligning
individual feature embeddings by leveraging a dynamic hard mining strategy,
thereby enhancing learning from challenging examples. Relation-Based Pairwise
Similarity Distillation captures relational information through pairwise
similarity relationships, employing a memory bank mechanism and a sample mining
strategy. This unified framework ensures both effective instance-level
alignment and preservation of geometric relationships between samples, leading
to a more comprehensive distillation process. Our unified framework outperforms
state-of-the-art distillation methods across multiple benchmark face
recognition datasets, as demonstrated by extensive experimental evaluations.
Interestingly, when using strong teacher networks compared to the student, our
unified KD enables the student to even surpass the teacher's accuracy.

Abstract: Atmospheric turbulence severely degrades video quality by introducing
distortions such as geometric warping, blur, and temporal flickering, posing
significant challenges to both visual clarity and temporal consistency. Current
state-of-the-art methods are based on transformer and 3D architectures and
require multi-frame input, but their large computational cost and memory usage
limit real-time deployment, especially in resource-constrained scenarios. In
this work, we propose RMFAT: Recurrent Multi-scale Feature Atmospheric
Turbulence Mitigator, designed for efficient and temporally consistent video
restoration under AT conditions. RMFAT adopts a lightweight recurrent framework
that restores each frame using only two inputs at a time, significantly
reducing temporal window size and computational burden. It further integrates
multi-scale feature encoding and decoding with temporal warping modules at both
encoder and decoder stages to enhance spatial detail and temporal coherence.
Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world atmospheric turbulence
datasets demonstrate that RMFAT not only outperforms existing methods in terms
of clarity restoration (with nearly a 9\% improvement in SSIM) but also
achieves significantly improved inference speed (more than a fourfold reduction
in runtime), making it particularly suitable for real-time atmospheric
turbulence suppression tasks.

TL;DR: SelfAdapt是一种无需标签的自适应方法，用于改进预训练的细胞分割模型，性能提升显著。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有通用模型（如Cellpose）在训练数据以外的领域表现下降，而监督微调需要标注数据。

Method: 基于师生增强一致性训练，引入L2-SP正则化和无标签停止标准。

Result: 在LiveCell和TissueNet数据集上，AP0.5相对提升达29.64%。

Conclusion: SelfAdapt是一种高效的无监督自适应方法，可作为Cellpose的扩展使用。

Abstract: Deep neural networks have become the go-to method for biomedical instance
segmentation. Generalist models like Cellpose demonstrate state-of-the-art
performance across diverse cellular data, though their effectiveness often
degrades on domains that differ from their training data. While supervised
fine-tuning can address this limitation, it requires annotated data that may
not be readily available. We propose SelfAdapt, a method that enables the
adaptation of pre-trained cell segmentation models without the need for labels.
Our approach builds upon student-teacher augmentation consistency training,
introducing L2-SP regularization and label-free stopping criteria. We evaluate
our method on the LiveCell and TissueNet datasets, demonstrating relative
improvements in AP0.5 of up to 29.64% over baseline Cellpose. Additionally, we
show that our unsupervised adaptation can further improve models that were
previously fine-tuned with supervision. We release SelfAdapt as an easy-to-use
extension of the Cellpose framework. The code for our method is publicly
available at https: //github.com/Kainmueller-Lab/self_adapt.

Motivation: 生物识别模板的隐私和安全性是关键问题，而同态加密带来的计算挑战需要解决。多模态融合和深度学习特征提取为优化提供了可能。

Method: 研究使用深度学习提取的面部、指纹和虹膜特征，通过维度减少和多模态融合，评估了在虚拟多生物特征数据库上的性能。

Result: 多模态融合可将模板尺寸减少67%，同时保持与单模态相当的等错误率（EER）。

Conclusion: 多模态生物特征融合在减少模板尺寸和提高加密处理效率方面具有潜力，同时保持高安全性。

Abstract: Biometric recognition is widely used, making the privacy and security of
extracted templates a critical concern. Biometric Template Protection schemes,
especially those utilizing Homomorphic Encryption, introduce significant
computational challenges due to increased workload. Recent advances in deep
neural networks have enabled state-of-the-art feature extraction for face,
fingerprint, and iris modalities. The ubiquity and affordability of biometric
sensors further facilitate multi-modal fusion, which can enhance security by
combining features from different modalities. This work investigates the
biometric performance of reduced multi-biometric template sizes. Experiments
are conducted on an in-house virtual multi-biometric database, derived from
DNN-extracted features for face, fingerprint, and iris, using the FRGC, MCYT,
and CASIA databases. The evaluated approaches are (i) explainable and
straightforward to implement under encryption, (ii) training-free, and (iii)
capable of generalization. Dimensionality reduction of feature vectors leads to
fewer operations in the Homomorphic Encryption (HE) domain, enabling more
efficient encrypted processing while maintaining biometric accuracy and
security at a level equivalent to or exceeding single-biometric recognition.
Our results demonstrate that, by fusing feature vectors from multiple
modalities, template size can be reduced by 67 % with no loss in Equal Error
Rate (EER) compared to the best-performing single modality.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶需要结合多模态上下文理解和精确预测，而VLM和DWM分别擅长行为预测和场景生成，但两者的整合尚未充分研究。

Method: 提出ImagiDrive框架，将VLM驱动的驾驶代理与DWM驱动的场景想象器结合，通过迭代优化规划和场景生成，并引入早期停止机制和轨迹选择策略。

Result: 在nuScenes和NAVSIM数据集上的实验表明，ImagiDrive在开环和闭环条件下均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: ImagiDrive通过整合VLM和DWM，显著提升了自动驾驶的预测准确性和规划效率。

Abstract: Autonomous driving requires rich contextual comprehension and precise
predictive reasoning to navigate dynamic and complex environments safely.
Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and Driving World Models (DWMs) have
independently emerged as powerful recipes addressing different aspects of this
challenge. VLMs provide interpretability and robust action prediction through
their ability to understand multi-modal context, while DWMs excel in generating
detailed and plausible future driving scenarios essential for proactive
planning. Integrating VLMs with DWMs is an intuitive, promising, yet
understudied strategy to exploit the complementary strengths of accurate
behavioral prediction and realistic scene generation. Nevertheless, this
integration presents notable challenges, particularly in effectively connecting
action-level decisions with high-fidelity pixel-level predictions and
maintaining computational efficiency. In this paper, we propose ImagiDrive, a
novel end-to-end autonomous driving framework that integrates a VLM-based
driving agent with a DWM-based scene imaginer to form a unified
imagination-and-planning loop. The driving agent predicts initial driving
trajectories based on multi-modal inputs, guiding the scene imaginer to
generate corresponding future scenarios. These imagined scenarios are
subsequently utilized to iteratively refine the driving agent's planning
decisions. To address efficiency and predictive accuracy challenges inherent in
this integration, we introduce an early stopping mechanism and a trajectory
selection strategy. Extensive experimental validation on the nuScenes and
NAVSIM datasets demonstrates the robustness and superiority of ImagiDrive over
previous alternatives under both open-loop and closed-loop conditions.

Result: 实验表明当前方法在视觉几何缺失时仍能保留语义信息，但存在显著局限性。

Conclusion: 强调了开发更鲁棒的物体移除技术的必要性，以应对真实场景的复杂性。

Abstract: Understanding what semantic information persists after object removal is
critical for privacy-preserving 3D reconstruction and editable scene
representations. In this work, we introduce a novel benchmark and evaluation
framework to measure semantic residuals, the unintended semantic traces left
behind, after object removal in 3D Gaussian Splatting. We conduct experiments
across a diverse set of indoor and outdoor scenes, showing that current methods
can preserve semantic information despite the absence of visual geometry. We
also release Remove360, a dataset of pre/post-removal RGB images and
object-level masks captured in real-world environments. While prior datasets
have focused on isolated object instances, Remove360 covers a broader and more
complex range of indoor and outdoor scenes, enabling evaluation of object
removal in the context of full-scene representations. Given ground truth images
of a scene before and after object removal, we assess whether we can truly
eliminate semantic presence, and if downstream models can still infer what was
removed. Our findings reveal critical limitations in current 3D object removal
techniques and underscore the need for more robust solutions capable of
handling real-world complexity. The evaluation framework is available at

Result: 实验表明，MM-R1能以零样本方式生成高主题保真度和强文本对齐的个性化图像。

Conclusion: MM-R1为统一MLLMs的个性化图像生成提供了高效且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) with unified architectures excel
across a wide range of vision-language tasks, yet aligning them with
personalized image generation remains a significant challenge. Existing methods
for MLLMs are frequently subject-specific, demanding a data-intensive
fine-tuning process for every new subject, which limits their scalability. In
this paper, we introduce MM-R1, a framework that integrates a cross-modal
Chain-of-Thought (X-CoT) reasoning strategy to unlock the inherent potential of
unified MLLMs for personalized image generation. Specifically, we structure
personalization as an integrated visual reasoning and generation process: (1)
grounding subject concepts by interpreting and understanding user-provided
images and contextual cues, and (2) generating personalized images conditioned
on both the extracted subject representations and user prompts. To further
enhance the reasoning capability, we adopt Grouped Reward Proximal Policy
Optimization (GRPO) to explicitly align the generation. Experiments demonstrate
that MM-R1 unleashes the personalization capability of unified MLLMs to
generate images with high subject fidelity and strong text alignment in a
zero-shot manner.

Conclusion: 该方法为资源有限环境下的医学图像分类提供了高效可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Intelligent analysis of medical imaging plays a crucial role in assisting
clinical diagnosis. However, achieving efficient and high-accuracy image
classification in resource-constrained computational environments remains
challenging. This study proposes a medical image classification method based on
an improved ConvNeXt-Tiny architecture. Through structural optimization and
loss function design, the proposed method enhances feature extraction
capability and classification performance while reducing computational
complexity. Specifically, the method introduces a dual global pooling (Global
Average Pooling and Global Max Pooling) feature fusion strategy into the
ConvNeXt-Tiny backbone to simultaneously preserve global statistical features
and salient response information. A lightweight channel attention module,
termed Squeeze-and-Excitation Vector (SEVector), is designed to improve the
adaptive allocation of channel weights while minimizing parameter overhead.
Additionally, a Feature Smoothing Loss is incorporated into the loss function
to enhance intra-class feature consistency and suppress intra-class variance.
Under CPU-only conditions (8 threads), the method achieves a maximum
classification accuracy of 89.10% on the test set within 10 training epochs,
exhibiting a stable convergence trend in loss values. Experimental results
demonstrate that the proposed method effectively improves medical image
classification performance in resource-limited settings, providing a feasible
and efficient solution for the deployment and promotion of medical imaging
analysis models.

Result: Dice系数74.54%，推理速度1.9 FPS，优于传统方法。

Conclusion: CoFi高效、准确，适合临床肾病理研究与应用。

Abstract: Accurate segmentation of the glomerular basement membrane (GBM) in electron
microscopy (EM) images is fundamental for quantifying membrane thickness and
supporting the diagnosis of various kidney diseases. While supervised deep
learning approaches achieve high segmentation accuracy, their reliance on
extensive pixel-level annotation renders them impractical for clinical
workflows. Few-shot learning can reduce this annotation burden but often
struggles to capture the fine structural details necessary for GBM analysis. In
this study, we introduce CoFi, a fast and efficient coarse-to-fine few-shot
segmentation pipeline designed for GBM delineation in EM images. CoFi first
trains a lightweight neural network using only three annotated images to
produce an initial coarse segmentation mask. This mask is then automatically
processed to generate high-quality point prompts with morphology-aware pruning,
which are subsequently used to guide SAM in refining the segmentation. The
proposed method achieved exceptional GBM segmentation performance, with a Dice
coefficient of 74.54% and an inference speed of 1.9 FPS. We demonstrate that
CoFi not only alleviates the annotation and computational burdens associated
with conventional methods, but also achieves accurate and reliable segmentation
results. The pipeline's speed and annotation efficiency make it well-suited for
research and hold strong potential for clinical applications in renal
pathology. The pipeline is publicly available at:

Abstract: Abnormal Human Behavior Detection (AHBD) under special scenarios is becoming

Abstract: The construction industry increasingly relies on visual data to support
Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) applications for site
monitoring. High-quality, domain-specific datasets, comprising images, videos,
and point clouds, capture site geometry and spatiotemporal dynamics, including
the location and interaction of objects, workers, and materials. However,
despite growing interest in leveraging visual datasets, existing resources vary
widely in sizes, data modalities, annotation quality, and representativeness of
real-world construction conditions. A systematic review to categorize their
data characteristics and application contexts is still lacking, limiting the
community's ability to fully understand the dataset landscape, identify
critical gaps, and guide future directions toward more effective, reliable, and
scalable AI applications in construction. To address this gap, this study
conducts an extensive search of academic databases and open-data platforms,
yielding 51 publicly available visual datasets that span the 2005-2024 period.
These datasets are categorized using a structured data schema covering (i) data
fundamentals (e.g., size and license), (ii) data modalities (e.g., RGB and

downstream application domains (e.g., progress tracking). This study
synthesizes these findings into an open-source catalog, OpenConstruction,
supporting data-driven method development. Furthermore, the study discusses
several critical limitations in the existing construction dataset landscape and
presents a roadmap for future data infrastructure anchored in the Findability,
Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reusability (FAIR) principles. By

Conclusion: CineTrans通过创新的掩码控制和数据集支持，为多镜头视频生成提供了高质量解决方案。

Abstract: Despite significant advances in video synthesis, research into multi-shot
video generation remains in its infancy. Even with scaled-up models and massive
datasets, the shot transition capabilities remain rudimentary and unstable,
largely confining generated videos to single-shot sequences. In this work, we
introduce CineTrans, a novel framework for generating coherent multi-shot
videos with cinematic, film-style transitions. To facilitate insights into the
film editing style, we construct a multi-shot video-text dataset Cine250K with
detailed shot annotations. Furthermore, our analysis of existing video
diffusion models uncovers a correspondence between attention maps in the
diffusion model and shot boundaries, which we leverage to design a mask-based
control mechanism that enables transitions at arbitrary positions and transfers
effectively in a training-free setting. After fine-tuning on our dataset with
the mask mechanism, CineTrans produces cinematic multi-shot sequences while
adhering to the film editing style, avoiding unstable transitions or naive
concatenations. Finally, we propose specialized evaluation metrics for
transition control, temporal consistency and overall quality, and demonstrate
through extensive experiments that CineTrans significantly outperforms existing
baselines across all criteria.

Conclusion: VeteranAD通过感知与规划的深度耦合，显著提升了自动驾驶的准确性和可靠性。

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving has achieved remarkable advancements in recent
years. Existing methods primarily follow a perception-planning paradigm, where
perception and planning are executed sequentially within a fully differentiable
framework for planning-oriented optimization. We further advance this paradigm
through a perception-in-plan framework design, which integrates perception into
the planning process. This design facilitates targeted perception guided by
evolving planning objectives over time, ultimately enhancing planning
performance. Building on this insight, we introduce VeteranAD, a coupled
perception and planning framework for end-to-end autonomous driving. By
incorporating multi-mode anchored trajectories as planning priors, the
perception module is specifically designed to gather traffic elements along
these trajectories, enabling comprehensive and targeted perception. Planning
trajectories are then generated based on both the perception results and the
planning priors. To make perception fully serve planning, we adopt an
autoregressive strategy that progressively predicts future trajectories while
focusing on relevant regions for targeted perception at each step. With this
simple yet effective design, VeteranAD fully unleashes the potential of
planning-oriented end-to-end methods, leading to more accurate and reliable
driving behavior. Extensive experiments on the NAVSIM and Bench2Drive datasets
demonstrate that our VeteranAD achieves state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have
  demonstrated strong performance in visual recognition tasks,
  but their inherent reliance on regular grid structures limits
  their capacity to model complex topological relationships and
  non-local semantics within images. To address this limita tion, we propose
the hierarchical graph feature enhancement
  (HGFE), a novel framework that integrates graph-based rea soning into CNNs to
enhance both structural awareness and
  feature representation. HGFE builds two complementary levels
  of graph structures: intra-window graph convolution to cap ture local spatial
dependencies and inter-window supernode
  interactions to model global semantic relationships. Moreover,
  we introduce an adaptive frequency modulation module that
  dynamically balances low-frequency and high-frequency signal
  propagation, preserving critical edge and texture information
  while mitigating over-smoothing. The proposed HGFE module
  is lightweight, end-to-end trainable, and can be seamlessly
  integrated into standard CNN backbone networks. Extensive
  experiments on CIFAR-100 (classification), PASCAL VOC,

  (segmentation), validated the effectiveness of the HGFE in
  improving structural representation and enhancing overall
  recognition performance.

Result: 在多个数据集上验证，AIM显著提升可解释性（EPG分数）和准确性。

Conclusion: AIM能有效促进模型使用真实特征，提升泛化能力和人类对齐的可解释性。

Abstract: It has been observed that deep neural networks (DNNs) often use both genuine
as well as spurious features. In this work, we propose "Amending Inherent
Interpretability via Self-Supervised Masking" (AIM), a simple yet interestingly
effective method that promotes the network's utilization of genuine features
over spurious alternatives without requiring additional annotations. In
particular, AIM uses features at multiple encoding stages to guide a
self-supervised, sample-specific feature-masking process. As a result, AIM
enables the training of well-performing and inherently interpretable models
that faithfully summarize the decision process. We validate AIM across a
diverse range of challenging datasets that test both out-of-distribution
generalization and fine-grained visual understanding. These include
general-purpose classification benchmarks such as ImageNet100, HardImageNet,
and ImageWoof, as well as fine-grained classification datasets such as
Waterbirds, TravelingBirds, and CUB-200. AIM demonstrates significant dual
benefits: interpretability improvements, as measured by the Energy Pointing
Game (EPG) score, and accuracy gains over strong baselines. These consistent
gains across domains and architectures provide compelling evidence that AIM
promotes the use of genuine and meaningful features that directly contribute to
improved generalization and human-aligned interpretability.

Motivation: 快速发展的长江三角洲地区交通基础设施老化问题突出，传统人工检测效率低，现有深度学习模型对小目标裂缝检测效果不佳，亟需高效解决方案。

Method: 模型采用三阶段优化：1) 动态KernelWarehouse卷积增强特征表示；2) 三重注意力机制强化通道-空间交互；3) FP-IoU损失函数优化边界框回归。

Result: 实验显示模型性能显著提升，精确率达91.3%，召回率76.6%，mAP@50为86.4%，且在数据稀缺和噪声干扰下表现稳定。

Conclusion: 该研究为自动化基础设施检测提供了高效计算机视觉解决方案，具有重要工程应用价值。

Abstract: Accelerated aging of transportation infrastructure in the rapidly developing
Yangtze River Delta region necessitates efficient concrete crack detection, as
crack deterioration critically compromises structural integrity and regional
economic growth. To overcome the limitations of inefficient manual inspection
and the suboptimal performance of existing deep learning models, particularly
for small-target crack detection within complex backgrounds, this paper
proposes YOLOv11-KW-TA-FP, a multi-task concrete crack detection and
segmentation model based on the YOLOv11n architecture. The proposed model
integrates a three-stage optimization framework: (1) Embedding dynamic
KernelWarehouse convolution (KWConv) within the backbone network to enhance
feature representation through a dynamic kernel sharing mechanism; (2)
Incorporating a triple attention mechanism (TA) into the feature pyramid to
strengthen channel-spatial interaction modeling; and (3) Designing an FP-IoU
loss function to facilitate adaptive bounding box regression penalization.
Experimental validation demonstrates that the enhanced model achieves
significant performance improvements over the baseline, attaining 91.3%
precision, 76.6% recall, and 86.4% mAP@50. Ablation studies confirm the
synergistic efficacy of the proposed modules. Furthermore, robustness tests
indicate stable performance under conditions of data scarcity and noise
interference. This research delivers an efficient computer vision solution for
automated infrastructure inspection, exhibiting substantial practical
engineering value.

TL;DR: 提出了一种多状态跟踪器（MST），通过轻量级的状态增强和交互模块提升特征表示能力，显著提高了跟踪精度和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有高效跟踪器因降低计算复杂度和参数数量而牺牲了特征表示能力，限制了其在复杂环境中的准确性。

Method: MST采用多状态生成（MSG）生成多阶段特征，通过状态特定增强（SSE）优化特征，并利用跨状态交互（CSI）模块自适应聚合特征。

Result: 实验表明，MST在多个数据集上优于现有高效跟踪器，计算开销仅为0.1 GFLOPs和0.66 M参数，AO分数提升4.5%。

Conclusion: MST通过轻量级设计显著提升了跟踪性能，适用于复杂环境。

Abstract: Efficient trackers achieve faster runtime by reducing computational
complexity and model parameters. However, this efficiency often compromises the
expense of weakened feature representation capacity, thus limiting their
ability to accurately capture target states using single-layer features. To
overcome this limitation, we propose Multi-State Tracker (MST), which utilizes
highly lightweight state-specific enhancement (SSE) to perform specialized
enhancement on multi-state features produced by multi-state generation (MSG)
and aggregates them in an interactive and adaptive manner using cross-state
interaction (CSI). This design greatly enhances feature representation while
incurring minimal computational overhead, leading to improved tracking
robustness in complex environments. Specifically, the MSG generates multiple
state representations at multiple stages during feature extraction, while SSE
refines them to highlight target-specific features. The CSI module facilitates
information exchange between these states and ensures the integration of
complementary features. Notably, the introduced SSE and CSI modules adopt a
highly lightweight hidden state adaptation-based state space duality (HSA-SSD)
design, incurring only 0.1 GFLOPs in computation and 0.66 M in parameters.
Experimental results demonstrate that MST outperforms all previous efficient
trackers across multiple datasets, significantly improving tracking accuracy
and robustness. In particular, it shows excellent runtime performance, with an
AO score improvement of 4.5\% over the previous SOTA efficient tracker HCAT on
the GOT-10K dataset. The code is available at https://github.com/wsumel/MST.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在推理时缺乏可解释性且性能不足，需改进时空推理能力。

Method: 采用Group Relative Policy Optimization（GRPO）和Chain-of-Thought（CoT）初始化训练模型，结合高质量CoT数据增强推理能力。

Result: 在多个基准测试中表现最优（如ReVOS和ReasonVOS），且抗幻觉能力提升（+8.8 R）。

Conclusion: Veason-R1通过结构化推理和强化学习优化，显著提升了视频推理分割的性能和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Video reasoning segmentation (VRS) endeavors to delineate referred objects in
videos guided by implicit instructions that encapsulate human intent and
temporal logic. Previous approaches leverage large vision language models
(LVLMs) to encode object semantics into <SEG> tokens for mask prediction.
However, this paradigm suffers from limited interpretability during inference
and suboptimal performance due to inadequate spatiotemporal reasoning. Drawing
inspiration from seminal breakthroughs in reinforcement learning, we introduce
Veason-R1, a specialized LVLM for VRS that emphasizes structured reasoning in
segmentation. Veason-R1 is trained through Group Relative Policy Optimization
(GRPO) augmented with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) initialization. To begin with, we
curate high-quality CoT training data to instill structured reasoning
trajectories, bridging video-level semantics and frame-level spatial grounding,
yielding the supervised fine-tuned model Veason-SFT. Subsequently, GRPO
fine-tuning encourages efficient exploration of the reasoning space by
optimizing reasoning chains. To this end, we incorporate a holistic reward
mechanism that synergistically enhances spatial alignment and temporal
consistency, bolstering keyframe localization and fine-grained grounding.
Comprehensive empirical evaluations demonstrate that Veason-R1 achieves
state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks, surpassing prior art by
significant margins (e.g., +1.3 J &F in ReVOS and +10.0 J &F in ReasonVOS),
while exhibiting robustness to hallucinations (+8.8 R). Our code and model
weights will be available at Veason-R1.

Motivation: 工业异常检测中数据稀缺问题突出，现有异常生成方法缺乏逼真性或需额外训练数据。

Method: AAG框架结合Stable Diffusion，利用Cross-Attention Enhancement（CAE）和Self-Attention Enhancement（SAE）改进生成效果，无需训练。

Result: 在MVTec AD和VisA数据集上验证了AAG的有效性，生成的异常图像能提升下游任务性能。

Conclusion: AAG为工业异常检测提供了一种高效、无需训练的异常生成解决方案。

Abstract: Industrial anomaly detection (AD) plays a significant role in manufacturing
where a long-standing challenge is data scarcity. A growing body of works have
emerged to address insufficient anomaly data via anomaly generation. However,
these anomaly generation methods suffer from lack of fidelity or need to be
trained with extra data. To this end, we propose a training-free anomaly
generation framework dubbed AAG, which is based on Stable Diffusion (SD)'s
strong generation ability for effective anomaly image generation. Given a
normal image, mask and a simple text prompt, AAG can generate realistic and
natural anomalies in the specific regions and simultaneously keep contents in
other regions unchanged. In particular, we propose Cross-Attention Enhancement
(CAE) to re-engineer the cross-attention mechanism within Stable Diffusion
based on the given mask. CAE increases the similarity between visual tokens in
specific regions and text embeddings, which guides these generated visual
tokens in accordance with the text description. Besides, generated anomalies
need to be more natural and plausible with object in given image. We propose
Self-Attention Enhancement (SAE) which improves similarity between each normal
visual token and anomaly visual tokens. SAE ensures that generated anomalies
are coherent with original pattern. Extensive experiments on MVTec AD and VisA
datasets demonstrate effectiveness of AAG in anomaly generation and its
utility. Furthermore, anomaly images generated by AAG can bolster performance
of various downstream anomaly inspection tasks.

Motivation: 视频语言模型在多模态理解方面取得进展，但时间理解（如事件顺序、持续时间和跨时间关系）仍是核心挑战。研究旨在探索时间信息在模型中的整合机制。

Method: 通过实验分析时间信息的整合路径，发现时间线索通过帧间注意力逐步合成并最终整合到查询令牌中。基于此，提出了分阶段跨模态注意力和时间退出机制两种策略。

Result: 实验验证了两种策略的有效性，揭示了时间推理源于视觉令牌间的交互，并受因果注意力约束。

Conclusion: 本研究首次系统探讨了视频语言模型中的时间理解，为未来模型改进提供了见解。

Abstract: Video language models (VideoLMs) have made significant progress in multimodal
understanding. However, temporal understanding, which involves identifying
event order, duration, and relationships across time, still remains a core
challenge. Prior works emphasize positional encodings (PEs) as a key mechanism
for encoding temporal structure. Surprisingly, we find that removing or
modifying PEs in video inputs yields minimal degradation in the performance of
temporal understanding. In contrast, reversing the frame sequence while
preserving the original PEs causes a substantial drop. To explain this
behavior, we conduct substantial analysis experiments to trace how temporal
information is integrated within the model. We uncover a causal information
pathway: temporal cues are progressively synthesized through inter-frame
attention, aggregated in the final frame, and subsequently integrated into the
query tokens. This emergent mechanism shows that temporal reasoning emerges
from inter-visual token interactions under the constraints of causal attention,
which implicitly encodes temporal structure. Based on these insights, we
propose two efficiency-oriented strategies: staged cross-modal attention and a
temporal exit mechanism for early token truncation. Experiments on two
benchmarks validate the effectiveness of both approaches. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first work to systematically investigate video temporal
understanding in VideoLMs, offering insights for future model improvement.

Method: 开发了一个端到端流程，结合单目深度估计、深度误差校正和几何三角测量，从车载摄像头视频中提取空间和结构数据。

Conclusion: 该框架为城市植被和基础设施监测提供了一种实时、低成本且可扩展的解决方案，适用于公用事业公司和城市规划者。

Abstract: Our study introduces a novel, low-cost, and reproducible framework for
real-time, object-level structural assessment and geolocation of roadside
vegetation and infrastructure with commonly available but underutilized
dashboard camera (dashcam) video data. We developed an end-to-end pipeline that
combines monocular depth estimation, depth error correction, and geometric
triangulation to generate accurate spatial and structural data from
street-level video streams from vehicle-mounted dashcams. Depth maps were first
estimated using a state-of-the-art monocular depth model, then refined via a
gradient-boosted regression framework to correct underestimations, particularly
for distant objects. The depth correction model achieved strong predictive
performance (R2 = 0.92, MAE = 0.31 on transformed scale), significantly
reducing bias beyond 15 m. Further, object locations were estimated using
GPS-based triangulation, while object heights were calculated using pin hole
camera geometry. Our method was evaluated under varying conditions of camera
placement and vehicle speed. Low-speed vehicle with inside camera gave the
highest accuracy, with mean geolocation error of 2.83 m, and mean absolute
error (MAE) in height estimation of 2.09 m for trees and 0.88 m for poles. To
the best of our knowledge, it is the first framework to combine monocular depth
modeling, triangulated GPS-based geolocation, and real-time structural
assessment for urban vegetation and infrastructure using consumer-grade video
data. Our approach complements conventional RS methods, such as LiDAR and image
by offering a fast, real-time, and cost-effective solution for object-level
monitoring of vegetation risks and infrastructure exposure, making it
especially valuable for utility companies, and urban planners aiming for
scalable and frequent assessments in dynamic urban environments.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在文本驱动3D编辑中难以保持多视图一致性，导致编辑效果不足和细节模糊。

Method: CoreEditor采用对应约束注意力机制，结合几何对齐和语义相似性，优化多视图信息交换，并设计了选择性编辑流程。

Result: 实验表明，CoreEditor能生成高质量、3D一致的编辑结果，细节更清晰，显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: CoreEditor通过创新的注意力机制和语义建模，有效提升了文本驱动3D编辑的一致性和灵活性。

Abstract: Text-driven 3D editing seeks to modify 3D scenes according to textual
descriptions, and most existing approaches tackle this by adapting pre-trained
2D image editors to multi-view inputs. However, without explicit control over
multi-view information exchange, they often fail to maintain cross-view
consistency, leading to insufficient edits and blurry details. We introduce
CoreEditor, a novel framework for consistent text-to-3D editing. The key
innovation is a correspondence-constrained attention mechanism that enforces
precise interactions between pixels expected to remain consistent throughout
the diffusion denoising process. Beyond relying solely on geometric alignment,
we further incorporate semantic similarity estimated during denoising, enabling
more reliable correspondence modeling and robust multi-view editing. In
addition, we design a selective editing pipeline that allows users to choose
preferred results from multiple candidates, offering greater flexibility and
user control. Extensive experiments show that CoreEditor produces high-quality,
3D-consistent edits with sharper details, significantly outperforming prior
methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在多LoRA组合时表现不佳，尤其是在开放场景中。

Method: 在潜在空间中划分空间块，计算与基础模型的余弦相似性，构建空间感知权重矩阵，加权聚合LoRA输出。

Result: ClipScore提升1.3%，GPT-4V评估胜率72.43%，适用于多种潜在扩散模型。

Conclusion: LoRAtorio在多LoRA组合中表现卓越，具有广泛适用性。

Abstract: Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has become a widely adopted technique in
text-to-image diffusion models, enabling the personalisation of visual concepts
such as characters, styles, and objects. However, existing approaches struggle
to effectively compose multiple LoRA adapters, particularly in open-ended
settings where the number and nature of required skills are not known in
advance. In this work, we present LoRAtorio, a novel train-free framework for
multi-LoRA composition that leverages intrinsic model behaviour. Our method is
motivated by two key observations: (1) LoRA adapters trained on narrow domains
produce denoised outputs that diverge from the base model, and (2) when
operating out-of-distribution, LoRA outputs show behaviour closer to the base
model than when conditioned in distribution. The balance between these two
observations allows for exceptional performance in the single LoRA scenario,
which nevertheless deteriorates when multiple LoRAs are loaded. Our method
operates in the latent space by dividing it into spatial patches and computing
cosine similarity between each patch's predicted noise and that of the base
model. These similarities are used to construct a spatially-aware weight
matrix, which guides a weighted aggregation of LoRA outputs. To address domain
drift, we further propose a modification to classifier-free guidance that
incorporates the base model's unconditional score into the composition. We
extend this formulation to a dynamic module selection setting, enabling
inference-time selection of relevant LoRA adapters from a large pool. LoRAtorio
achieves state-of-the-art performance, showing up to a 1.3% improvement in
ClipScore and a 72.43% win rate in GPT-4V pairwise evaluations, and generalises
effectively to multiple latent diffusion models.

Motivation: 现有开源模型在图像处理和逻辑推理能力上不如专有模型，因此提出Thyme以填补这一空白。

Result: 在近20个基准测试中，Thyme显著提升了高分辨率感知和复杂推理任务的性能。

Conclusion: Thyme通过代码生成和执行实现了图像与逻辑推理的结合，为多模态模型提供了新思路。

Abstract: Following OpenAI's introduction of the ``thinking with images'' concept,
recent efforts have explored stimulating the use of visual information in the
reasoning process to enhance model performance in perception and reasoning
tasks. However, to the best of our knowledge, no open-source work currently
offers a feature set as rich as proprietary models (O3), which can perform
diverse image manipulations and simultaneously enhance logical reasoning
capabilities through code. In this paper, we make a preliminary attempt in this
direction by introducing Thyme (Think Beyond Images), a novel paradigm for
enabling MLLMs to transcend existing ``think with images'' approaches by
autonomously generating and executing diverse image processing and
computational operations via executable code. This approach not only
facilitates a rich, on-the-fly set of image manipulations (e.g., cropping,
rotation, contrast enhancement) but also allows for mathematical computations,
all while maintaining high autonomy in deciding when and how to apply these
operations. We activate this capability through a two-stage training strategy:
an initial SFT on a curated dataset of 500K samples to teach code generation,
followed by a RL phase to refine decision-making. For the RL stage, we manually
collect and design high-resolution question-answer pairs to increase the
learning difficulty, and we propose GRPO-ATS (Group Relative Policy
Optimization with Adaptive Temperature Sampling), an algorithm that applies
distinct temperatures to text and code generation to balance reasoning
exploration with code execution precision. We conduct extensive experimental
analysis and ablation studies. Comprehensive evaluations on nearly 20
benchmarks show that Thyme yields significant and consistent performance gains,
particularly in challenging high-resolution perception and complex reasoning
tasks.

Abstract: Employment on a societal scale contributes heavily to national and global
affairs; consequently, job openings and unemployment estimates provide
important information to financial markets and governments alike. However, such
reports often describe only the supply (employee job seeker) side of the job
market, and skill mismatches are poorly understood. Job postings aggregated on
recruiting platforms illuminate marketplace demand, but to date have primarily
focused on candidate skills described in their personal profiles. In this
paper, we report on a big data approach to estimating job market mismatches by
focusing on demand, as represented in publicly available job postings. We use
commercially available web scraping tools and a new data processing scheme to
build a job posting data set for the semiconductor industry, a strategically
critical sector of the United States economy; we focus on Southern California
as a central hub of advanced technologies. We report on the employer base and
relative needs of various job functions. Our work contributes on three fronts:
First, we provide nearly real-time insight into workforce demand; second, we
discuss disambiguation and semantic challenges in analysis of employer data

Motivation: 随着AI工具和LLM的快速发展，其输出中的偏见问题日益突出，亟需系统性文献综述以梳理研究脉络。

Method: 通过分析189篇论文，总结偏见研究的模式和关注的人类身份维度。

Result: 82%的论文未明确定义“偏见”，79.9%聚焦性别偏见，且多数研究忽视了非西方社区。仅10.6%的论文提出了实际应用建议。

Conclusion: 建议未来研究更关注多样化的边缘群体，并缩小学术界与工业界的差距。

Abstract: The rapid development of AI tools and implementation of LLMs within
downstream tasks has been paralleled by a surge in research exploring how the
outputs of such AI/LLM systems embed biases, a research topic which was already
being extensively explored before the era of ChatGPT. Given the high volume of
research around the biases within the outputs of AI systems and LLMs, it is
imperative to conduct systematic literature reviews to document throughlines
within such research. In this paper, we conduct such a review of research
covering AI/LLM bias in four premier venues/organizations -- *ACL, FAccT,
NeurIPS, and AAAI -- published over the past 10 years. Through a coverage of
189 papers, we uncover patterns of bias research and along what axes of human
identity they commonly focus. The first emergent pattern within the corpus was
that 82% (155/189) papers did not establish a working definition of "bias" for
their purposes, opting instead to simply state that biases and stereotypes
exist that can have harmful downstream effects while establishing only
mathematical and technical definition of bias. 94 of these 155 papers have been
published in the past 5 years, after Blodgett et al. (2020)'s literature review
with a similar finding about NLP research and recommendation to consider how
such researchers should conceptualize bias, going beyond strictly technical
definitions. Furthermore, we find that a large majority of papers -- 79.9% or
151/189 papers -- focus on gender bias (mostly, gender and occupation bias)
within the outputs of AI systems and LLMs. By demonstrating a strong focus
within the field on gender, race/ethnicity (30.2%; 57/189), age (20.6%;
39/189), religion (19.1%; 36/189) and nationality (13.2%; 25/189) bias, we
document how researchers adopt a fairly narrow conception of AI bias by
overlooking several non-Western communities in fairness research, as we
advocate for a stronger coverage of such populations. Finally, we note that
while our corpus contains several examples of innovative debiasing methods
across the aforementioned aspects of human identity, only 10.6% (20/189)
include recommendations for how to implement their findings or contributions in
real-world AI systems or design processes. This indicates a concerning
academia-industry gap, especially since many of the biases that our corpus
contains several successful mitigation methods that still persist within the
outputs of AI systems and LLMs commonly used today. We conclude with
recommendations towards future AI/LLM fairness research, with stronger focus on
diverse marginalized populations.

Abstract: With the rise of social media, rumor detection has drawn increasing
attention. Although numerous methods have been proposed with the development of
rumor classification datasets, they focus on identifying whether a post is a
rumor, lacking the ability to mark the specific rumor content. This limitation
largely stems from the lack of fine-grained marks in existing datasets.
Constructing a rumor dataset with rumor content information marking is of great
importance for fine-grained rumor identification. Such a dataset can facilitate
practical applications, including rumor tracing, content moderation, and
emergency response. Beyond being utilized for overall performance evaluation,
this dataset enables the training of rumor detection algorithms to learn
content marking, and thus improves their interpretability and reasoning
ability, enabling systems to effectively address specific rumor segments. This
paper constructs a dataset for rumor detection with fine-grained markings,
named CLMIR (Content-Level Marking Dataset for Identifying Rumors). In addition
to determining whether a post is a rumor, this dataset further marks the
specific content upon which the rumor is based.

TL;DR: 研究探讨老年人对AI深度伪造诈骗的认知及应对方式，强调跨代技术支持的潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI深度伪造技术被用于针对老年人的诈骗，传统防骗手段失效，需探索新方法。

Method: 通过焦点小组访谈37名65岁以上老年人，分析其对深度伪造诈骗的理解及跨代支持的价值。

Result: 老年人依赖信任关系识别诈骗，跨代合作可提升防护能力。

Conclusion: 应鼓励年轻人参与，共同增强老年人对AI诈骗的防范能力。

Abstract: AI-enhanced scams now employ deepfake technology to produce convincing audio
and visual impersonations of trusted family members, often grandchildren, in
real time. These attacks fabricate urgent scenarios, such as legal or medical
emergencies, to socially engineer older adults into transferring money. The
realism of these AI-generated impersonations undermines traditional cues used
to detect fraud, making them a powerful tool for financial exploitation. In
this study, we explore older adults' perceptions of these emerging threats and
their responses, with a particular focus on the role of youth, who may also be
impacted by having their identities exploited, in supporting older family
members' online safety. We conducted focus groups with 37 older adults (ages
65+) to examine their understanding of deepfake impersonation scams and the
value of intergenerational technology support. Findings suggest that older
adults frequently rely on trusted relationships to detect scams and develop
protective practices. Based on this, we identify opportunities to engage youth
as active partners in enhancing resilience across generations.

TL;DR: ASPIC+框架缺乏对一阶规则推理的智能基础化方法，本文提出了一种基于Datalog的智能基础化方法，并通过实验验证其可扩展性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有ASPIC+方法仅支持命题规则，一阶规则推理需要基础化步骤，但基础化可能导致输入理论规模指数增长，缺乏针对ASPIC+的专用解决方案。

Method: 将一阶ASPIC+实例转换为Datalog程序，利用Datalog引擎获取基础化替换，并提出针对ASPIC+的简化方法以减少无关规则的基础化。

Result: 提出了一种智能基础化方法，保持推理正确性的同时控制基础化规模，并通过原型实现验证了其可扩展性。

Conclusion: 本文方法有效解决了ASPIC+中一阶规则推理的基础化问题，为实际应用提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: ASPIC+ is one of the main general frameworks for rule-based argumentation for
AI. Although first-order rules are commonly used in ASPIC+ examples, most
existing approaches to reason over rule-based argumentation only support
propositional rules. To enable reasoning over first-order instances, a
preliminary grounding step is required. As groundings can lead to an
exponential increase in the size of the input theories, intelligent procedures
are needed. However, there is a lack of dedicated solutions for ASPIC+.
Therefore, we propose an intelligent grounding procedure that keeps the size of
the grounding manageable while preserving the correctness of the reasoning
process. To this end, we translate the first-order ASPIC+ instance into a
Datalog program and query a Datalog engine to obtain ground substitutions to
perform the grounding of rules and contraries. Additionally, we propose
simplifications specific to the ASPIC+ formalism to avoid grounding of rules
that have no influence on the reasoning process. Finally, we performed an
empirical evaluation of a prototypical implementation to show scalability.

Conclusion: 该研究将算法追索从个体推荐扩展到系统设计，为社会福祉提升提供了可行路径。

Abstract: Decision makers are increasingly relying on machine learning in sensitive
situations. In such settings, algorithmic recourse aims to provide individuals
with actionable and minimally costly steps to reverse unfavorable AI-driven
decisions. While existing research predominantly focuses on single-individual
(i.e., seeker) and single-model (i.e., provider) scenarios, real-world
applications often involve multiple interacting stakeholders. Optimizing
outcomes for seekers under an individual welfare approach overlooks the
inherently multi-agent nature of real-world systems, where individuals interact
and compete for limited resources. To address this, we introduce a novel
framework for multi-agent algorithmic recourse that accounts for multiple
recourse seekers and recourse providers. We model this many-to-many interaction
as a capacitated weighted bipartite matching problem, where matches are guided
by both recourse cost and provider capacity. Edge weights, reflecting recourse
costs, are optimized for social welfare while quantifying the welfare gap
between individual welfare and this collectively feasible outcome. We propose a
three-layer optimization framework: (1) basic capacitated matching, (2) optimal
capacity redistribution to minimize the welfare gap, and (3) cost-aware
optimization balancing welfare maximization with capacity adjustment costs.
Experimental validation on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrates that
our framework enables the many-to-many algorithmic recourse to achieve
near-optimal welfare with minimum modification in system settings. This work
extends algorithmic recourse from individual recommendations to system-level
design, providing a tractable path toward higher social welfare while
maintaining individual actionability.

Conclusion: 该框架为质子治疗计划提供了一种高效、自动化的解决方案，具有临床实用价值。

Abstract: Proton PBS treatment planning for H&N cancers involves numerous conflicting
objectives, requiring significant effort from human planners to balance and
satisfy multiple clinical goals during planning. To achieve this,
experience-demanding objective parameter adjustment and computationally
expensive inverse optimization are performed iteratively. Extensive efforts
have been made to automatically adjust objective parameters, but the most
time-consuming component, i.e., inverse optimization, still relies heavily on
theory-driven approaches. We propose a data-driven inverse optimizer and
integrate it into a PPO-based automatic treatment planning framework to
automatically generate high-quality plans within a clinical acceptable planning
time. The inverse optimizer is a L2O method that predicts update steps by
learning from the task-specific data distribution. For the first time, we
integrate techniques designed for long-context processing, originally developed
for LLMs, into a Transformer-based L2O framework to address the scalability
issue of existing L2O methods. The PPO framework functions as an outer-loop
virtual planner, autonomously adjusting objective parameters through a policy
network, and the dose predictor is used to initialize objective parameters. The
inner-loop L2O inverse optimizer computes machine-deliverable MU values based
on objectives refined by the PPO policy network. 97 patients are collected in
this study, and compared with L-BFGSB, our L2O-based inverse optimizer improves
the effectiveness and efficiency by 22.97% and 36.41%, respectively. In
conjunction with the PPO-based learned virtual planner, plans generated by our
framework within an average of 2.55 hours show improved or comparable OAR
sparing with superior target coverage for patients with different prescription
dose levels, number of target volumes, beam angles, etc., compared with
human-generated plans.

Conclusion: 强和弱可接受性在非平坦ABA中具有研究价值，但也需进一步解决其缺陷。

Abstract: In this work, we broaden the investigation of admissibility notions in the
context of assumption-based argumentation (ABA). More specifically, we study
two prominent alternatives to the standard notion of admissibility from
abstract argumentation, namely strong and weak admissibility, and introduce the
respective preferred, complete and grounded semantics for general (sometimes
called non-flat) ABA. To do so, we use abstract bipolar set-based argumentation
frameworks (BSAFs) as formal playground since they concisely capture the
relations between assumptions and are expressive enough to represent general
non-flat ABA frameworks, as recently shown. While weak admissibility has been
recently investigated for a restricted fragment of ABA in which assumptions
cannot be derived (flat ABA), strong admissibility has not been investigated
for ABA so far. We introduce strong admissibility for ABA and investigate
desirable properties. We furthermore extend the recent investigations of weak
admissibility in the flat ABA fragment to the non-flat case. We show that the
central modularization property is maintained under classical, strong, and weak
admissibility. We also show that strong and weakly admissible semantics in
non-flat ABA share some of the shortcomings of standard admissible semantics
and discuss ways to address these.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准仅评估LRMs在解决定义明确问题上的能力，而真正的智能代理应能主动请求补充信息。论文旨在填补这一评估空白。

Method: 提出包含两类不完整问题的新数据集，并系统评估LRMs在这些问题上的表现，分析其行为（如过度思考和幻觉）。

Result: 发现LRMs无法主动请求信息，且存在过度思考和幻觉问题。监督微调虽有潜力，但仍面临挑战。

Conclusion: 论文呼吁开发更具真正智能的LRMs，而不仅是问题解决能力，为未来研究提供了新视角。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) have demonstrated remarkable problem-solving
abilities in mathematics, as evaluated by existing benchmarks exclusively on
well-defined problems. However, such evaluation setup constitutes a critical
gap, since a genuine intelligent agent should not only solve problems (as a
math quiz solver), but also be able~to ask for information when the problems
lack sufficient information, enabling proactivity in responding users'
requests. To bridge such gap, we proposes a new dataset consisting of two types
of incomplete problems with diverse contexts. Based on the dataset, our
systematical evaluation of LRMs reveals their inability in proactively asking
for information. In addition, we uncover the behaviors related to overthinking
and hallucination of LRMs, and highlight the potential and challenges of
supervised fine-tuning in learning such ability. We hope to provide new
insights in developing LRMs with genuine intelligence, rather than just solving
problems.

TL;DR: SAGE是一个动态知识图谱嵌入框架，通过自适应调整嵌入维度和动态蒸馏机制，有效处理知识图谱的动态更新，显著优于现有基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实中的知识图谱是动态演化的，现有方法未能充分考虑更新规模和系统评估，因此需要一种更灵活的方法。

Method: SAGE根据更新规模确定嵌入维度并扩展嵌入空间，采用动态蒸馏机制平衡新旧知识。

Result: 在七个基准测试中，SAGE在MRR、H@1和H@10上分别提升1.38%、1.25%和1.6%，优于固定维度方法。

Conclusion: SAGE证明了自适应嵌入维度在动态知识图谱嵌入中的重要性，其代码已开源。

Abstract: Traditional knowledge graph (KG) embedding methods aim to represent entities
and relations in a low-dimensional space, primarily focusing on static graphs.
However, real-world KGs are dynamically evolving with the constant addition of
entities, relations and facts. To address such dynamic nature of KGs, several
continual knowledge graph embedding (CKGE) methods have been developed to
efficiently update KG embeddings to accommodate new facts while maintaining
learned knowledge. As KGs grow at different rates and scales in real-world
scenarios, existing CKGE methods often fail to consider the varying scales of
updates and lack systematic evaluation throughout the entire update process. In
this paper, we propose SAGE, a scale-aware gradual evolution framework for
CKGE. Specifically, SAGE firstly determine the embedding dimensions based on
the update scales and expand the embedding space accordingly. The Dynamic
Distillation mechanism is further employed to balance the preservation of
learned knowledge and the incorporation of new facts. We conduct extensive
experiments on seven benchmarks, and the results show that SAGE consistently
outperforms existing baselines, with a notable improvement of 1.38% in MRR,
1.25% in H@1 and 1.6% in H@10. Furthermore, experiments comparing SAGE with
methods using fixed embedding dimensions show that SAGE achieves optimal
performance on every snapshot, demonstrating the importance of adaptive
embedding dimensions in CKGE. The codes of SAGE are publicly available at:

Conclusion: 结合课程学习和强化学习能显著提升GUI交互任务的性能。

Abstract: As autonomous agents become adept at understanding and interacting with
graphical user interface (GUI) environments, a new era of automated task
execution is emerging. Recent studies have demonstrated that Reinforcement
Learning (RL) can effectively enhance agents' performance in dynamic
interactive GUI environments. However, these methods face two key limitations:
(1) they overlook the significant variation in difficulty across different GUI
tasks by treating the entire training data as a uniform set, which hampers the
agent's ability to adapt its learning process; and (2) most approaches collapse
task-specific nuances into a single, coarse reward, leaving the agent with a
uniform signal that yields inefficient policy updates. To address these
limitations, we propose CRAFT-GUI, a curriculum learning framework based on
Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) that explicitly accounts for the
varying difficulty across trajectories. To enable more fine-grained policy
optimization, we design a reward function that combines simple rule-based
signals with model-judged evaluation, providing richer and more nuanced
feedback during training. Experimental results demonstrate that our method
achieves significant improvements over previous state-of-the-art approaches,
outperforming them by 5.6% on public benchmarks Android Control and 10.3% on
our internal online benchmarks, respectively. These findings empirically
validate the effectiveness of integrating reinforcement learning with
curriculum learning in GUI interaction tasks.

Abstract: Recent advances in mathematical reasoning and the long-term planning
capabilities of large language models (LLMs) have precipitated the development
of agents, which are being increasingly leveraged in business operations
processes. Decision models to optimize inventory levels are one of the core
elements of operations management. However, the capabilities of the LLM agent
in making inventory decisions in uncertain contexts, as well as the
decision-making biases (e.g. framing effect, etc.) of the agent, remain largely
unexplored. This prompts concerns regarding the capacity of LLM agents to
effectively address real-world problems, as well as the potential implications
of biases that may be present. To address this gap, we introduce AIM-Bench, a
novel benchmark designed to assess the decision-making behaviour of LLM agents
in uncertain supply chain management scenarios through a diverse series of
inventory replenishment experiments. Our results reveal that different LLMs
typically exhibit varying degrees of decision bias that are similar to those
observed in human beings. In addition, we explored strategies to mitigate the
pull-to-centre effect and the bullwhip effect, namely cognitive reflection and
implementation of information sharing. These findings underscore the need for
careful consideration of the potential biases in deploying LLMs in Inventory
decision-making scenarios. We hope that these insights will pave the way for
mitigating human decision bias and developing human-centred decision support
systems for supply chains.

Conclusion: Inclusion Arena通过连接基础模型与实际应用，加速开发更实用的LLMs和MLLMs。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) and Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs)
have ushered in a new era of AI capabilities, demonstrating near-human-level
performance across diverse scenarios. While numerous benchmarks (e.g., MMLU)
and leaderboards (e.g., Chatbot Arena) have been proposed to help evolve the
development of LLMs and MLLMs, most rely on static datasets or crowdsourced
general-domain prompts, often falling short of reflecting performance in
real-world applications. To bridge this critical gap, we present Inclusion
Arena, a live leaderboard that ranks models based on human feedback collected
directly from AI-powered applications. Our platform integrates pairwise model
comparisons into natural user interactions, ensuring evaluations reflect
practical usage scenarios. For robust model ranking, we employ the
Bradley-Terry model augmented with two key innovations: (1) Placement Matches,
a cold-start mechanism to quickly estimate initial ratings for newly integrated
models, and (2) Proximity Sampling, an intelligent comparison strategy that
prioritizes battles between models of similar capabilities to maximize
information gain and enhance rating stability. Extensive empirical analyses and
simulations demonstrate that Inclusion Arena yields reliable and stable
rankings, exhibits higher data transitivity compared to general crowdsourced
datasets, and significantly mitigates the risk of malicious manipulation. By
fostering an open alliance between foundation models and real-world
applications, Inclusion Arena aims to accelerate the development of LLMs and
MLLMs truly optimized for practical, user-centric deployments. The platform is

Motivation: 地标在经典规划中已有重要贡献，但在随机领域应用较少，研究旨在探索其在随机规划中的潜力。

Method: 通过形式化概率地标，并调整UCT算法以利用地标作为子目标来分解MDP，核心在于平衡贪婪地标达成与长期目标达成。

Result: 在基准测试中，合适的地标选择显著提升了UCT算法的性能，但最佳平衡点因问题而异。

Conclusion: 地标可以为解决MDP的随时算法提供有效指导。

Abstract: Landmarks$\unicode{x2013}$conditions that must be satisfied at some point in
every solution plan$\unicode{x2013}$have contributed to major advancements in
classical planning, but they have seldom been used in stochastic domains. We
formalize probabilistic landmarks and adapt the UCT algorithm to leverage them
as subgoals to decompose MDPs; core to the adaptation is balancing between
greedy landmark achievement and final goal achievement. Our results in
benchmark domains show that well-chosen landmarks can significantly improve the
performance of UCT in online probabilistic planning, while the best balance of
greedy versus long-term goal achievement is problem-dependent. The results
suggest that landmarks can provide helpful guidance for anytime algorithms
solving MDPs.

Abstract: Addressing large-scale planning problems has become one of the central
challenges in the planning community, deriving from the state-space explosion
caused by growing objects and actions. Recently, researchers have explored the
effectiveness of leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate helpful
actions and states to prune the search space. However, prior works have largely
overlooked integrating LLMs with domain-specific knowledge to ensure valid
plans. In this paper, we propose a novel LLM-assisted planner integrated with
problem decomposition, which first decomposes large planning problems into
multiple simpler sub-tasks. Then we explore two novel paradigms to utilize
LLMs, i.e., LLM4Inspire and LLM4Predict, to assist problem decomposition, where
LLM4Inspire provides heuristic guidance according to general knowledge and
LLM4Predict employs domain-specific knowledge to infer intermediate conditions.
We empirically validate the effectiveness of our planner across multiple
domains, demonstrating the ability of search space partition when solving
large-scale planning problems. The experimental results show that LLMs
effectively locate feasible solutions when pruning the search space, where
infusing domain-specific knowledge into LLMs, i.e., LLM4Predict, holds
particular promise compared with LLM4Inspire, which offers general knowledge
within LLMs.

Abstract: Since the Fourth Industrial Revolution, AI technology has been widely used in
many fields, but there are several limitations that need to be overcome,
including overfitting/underfitting, class imbalance, and the limitations of
representation (hypothesis space) due to the characteristics of different
models. As a method to overcome these problems, ensemble, commonly known as
model combining, is being extensively used in the field of machine learning.
Among ensemble learning methods, voting ensembles have been studied with
various weighting methods, showing performance improvements. However, the
existing methods that reflect the pre-information of classifiers in weights
consider only one evaluation criterion, which limits the reflection of various
information that should be considered in a model realistically. Therefore, this
paper proposes a method of making decisions considering various information
through cooperative games in multi-criteria situations. Using this method,
various types of information known beforehand in classifiers can be
simultaneously considered and reflected, leading to appropriate weight
distribution and performance improvement. The machine learning algorithms were
applied to the Open-ML-CC18 dataset and compared with existing ensemble
weighting methods. The experimental results showed superior performance
compared to other weighting methods.

hierarchy within the reduced space to iteratively construct initial guesses for
the OpInf learning problem that prioritize the interactions of the dominant
modes. The initial guess computed for any target reduced dimension corresponds
to a ROM with provably smaller or equal snapshot reconstruction error than with
standard OpInf. Moreover, our nested OpInf algorithm can be warm-started from
previously learned models, enabling versatile application scenarios involving
dynamic basis and model form updates. We demonstrate the performance of our
algorithm on a cubic heat conduction problem, with nested OpInf achieving a
four times smaller error than standard OpInf at a comparable offline time.
Further, we apply nested OpInf to a large-scale, parameterized model of the
Greenland ice sheet where, despite model form approximation errors, it learns a
ROM with, on average, 3% error and computational speed-up factor above 19,000.

Conclusion: Apriel-Nemotron-15B-Thinker以更小的规模和成本实现了高性能。

Abstract: While large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable reasoning
capabilities across domains like code, math and other enterprise tasks, their
significant memory and computational costs often preclude their use in
practical enterprise settings. To this end, we introduce
Apriel-Nemotron-15B-Thinker, a 15-billion parameter model in the ServiceNow
Apriel SLM series that achieves performance against medium sized
state-of-the-art models such as o1-mini, QWQ32B, and EXAONE-Deep-32B while
maintaining only half the memory footprint of those alternatives.
Apriel-Nemotron-15B-Thinker model is trained in a four stage training pipeline
including 1) Base Model upscaling, 2) Continual Pre-training 3) Supervised
Fine-tuning (SFT) and 4) Reinforcement Learning using GRPO. Comprehensive
evaluations across a diverse suite of benchmarks consistently demonstrate that
our Apriel-Nemotron-15B-Thinker model matches or exceeds the performance of its
32-billion parameter counterparts, despite being less than half their size.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着LLMs能力的提升，其在高风险领域的应用需求增加，但现有公平性方法不适用于闭源LLMs（如GPT-4）。

Method: 将LLMs视为特征提取器，通过设计提示获取概率预测特征，再训练轻量级公平分类器。

Result: 在五个数据集上验证了方法的高效性，优于基于嵌入或原始特征的公平分类器。

Conclusion: 该方法为闭源LLMs的公平分类提供了一种高效且数据友好的解决方案。

Abstract: Instruction fine-tuned large language models (LLMs) enable a simple zero-shot
or few-shot prompting paradigm, also known as in-context learning, for building
prediction models. This convenience, combined with continued advances in LLM
capability, has the potential to drive their adoption across a broad range of
domains, including high-stakes applications where group fairness -- preventing
disparate impacts across demographic groups -- is essential. The majority of
existing approaches to enforcing group fairness on LLM-based classifiers rely
on traditional fair algorithms applied via model fine-tuning or head-tuning on
final-layer embeddings, but they are no longer applicable to closed-weight LLMs
under the in-context learning setting, which include some of the most capable
commercial models today, such as GPT-4, Gemini, and Claude. In this paper, we
propose a framework for deriving fair classifiers from closed-weight LLMs via
prompting: the LLM is treated as a feature extractor, and features are elicited
from its probabilistic predictions (e.g., token log probabilities) using
prompts strategically designed for the specified fairness criterion to obtain
sufficient statistics for fair classification; a fair algorithm is then applied
to these features to train a lightweight fair classifier in a post-hoc manner.
Experiments on five datasets, including three tabular ones, demonstrate strong
accuracy-fairness tradeoffs for the classifiers derived by our framework from
both open-weight and closed-weight LLMs; in particular, our framework is
data-efficient and outperforms fair classifiers trained on LLM embeddings
(i.e., head-tuning) or from scratch on raw tabular features.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗领域的数据共享受伦理、社会和制度限制，传统集中式学习难以实现，且传统训练方法容易过拟合和遗忘旧知识。

Method: 采用统一的提示池和最小扩展策略，通过冻结部分提示减少计算开销，并引入新的正则化项平衡保留与适应。

Result: 在三个糖尿病视网膜病变数据集上，分类准确率提升至少10%，F1分数提高9分，同时降低推理成本。

Conclusion: PCL方法有望推动可持续医疗AI发展，支持实时诊断和远程医疗应用。

Abstract: Modern AI models achieve state-of-the-art performance with large-scale,
high-quality datasets; however, ethical, social, and institutional constraints
in the medical domain severely restrict data sharing, rendering centralized
learning nearly impossible. Each institution must incrementally update models
using only local data. Traditional training overfits new samples and suffers
from catastrophic forgetting, losing previously acquired knowledge. Medical
data distributions also shift due to varying diagnostic equipment and
demographics. Although continual learning (CL) has advanced, most methods
address natural images, leaving medical-domain-specific CL underexplored. We
propose a prompt-based continual learning (PCL) approach featuring a unified
prompt pool with a minimal expansion strategy: by expanding and freezing a
subset of prompts, our method reduces computational overhead, and a novel
regularization term balances retention and adaptation. Experiments on three
diabetic retinopathy datasets Aptos2019, LI2019, and Diabetic Retinopathy
Detection show our model improves final classification accuracy by at least 10%
and F1-score by 9 points over state-of-the-art approaches while lowering
inference cost. We anticipate this study will drive sustainable medical AI
advances, enabling real-time diagnosis, patient monitoring, and telemedicine
applications in distributed healthcare. Code will be released upon acceptance

Conclusion: 研究提供了一个可扩展的框架，支持通过数据驱动的交通安全政策实现Vision Zero目标。

Abstract: Motor vehicle crashes remain a leading cause of injury and death worldwide,
necessitating data-driven approaches to understand and mitigate crash severity.
This study introduces a curated dataset of more than 3 million people involved
in accidents in Ohio over six years (2017-2022), aggregated to more than 2.3
million vehicle-level records for predictive analysis. The primary contribution
is a transparent and reproducible methodology that combines Automated Machine
Learning (AutoML) and explainable artificial intelligence (AI) to identify and
interpret key risk factors associated with severe crashes. Using the JADBio
AutoML platform, predictive models were constructed to distinguish between
severe and non-severe crash outcomes. The models underwent rigorous feature
selection across stratified training subsets, and their outputs were
interpreted using SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) to quantify the
contribution of individual features. A final Ridge Logistic Regression model
achieved an AUC-ROC of 85.6% on the training set and 84.9% on a hold-out test
set, with 17 features consistently identified as the most influential
predictors. Key features spanned demographic, environmental, vehicle, human,
and operational categories, including location type, posted speed, minimum
occupant age, and pre-crash action. Notably, certain traditionally emphasized
factors, such as alcohol or drug impairment, were less influential in the final
model compared to environmental and contextual variables. Emphasizing
methodological rigor and interpretability over mere predictive performance,
this study offers a scalable framework to support Vision Zero with aligned
interventions and advanced data-informed traffic safety policy.

Abstract: Retrosynthesis prediction aims to infer the reactant molecule based on a
given product molecule, which is a fundamental task in chemical synthesis.
However, existing models rely on static pattern-matching paradigm, which limits
their ability to perform effective logic decision-making, leading to black-box
decision-making. Building on this, we propose Retro-Expert, an interpretable
retrosynthesis framework that performs collaborative reasoning by combining the
complementary reasoning strengths of Large Language Models and specialized
models via reinforcement learning. It outputs natural language explanations
grounded in chemical logic through three components: (1) specialized models
perform shallow reasoning to construct high-quality chemical decision space,
(2) LLM-driven critical reasoning to generate predictions and corresponding
interpretable reasoning path, and (3) reinforcement learning optimizing
interpretable decision policy. Experiments show that Retro-Expert not only
surpasses both LLM-based and specialized models across different metrics but
also provides expert-aligned explanations that bridge the gap between AI
predictions and actionable chemical insights.

Motivation: 现有合成数据质量因素不明确，需探索高效生成方法以突破数据瓶颈。

Method: 提出BeyondWeb框架，优化合成数据生成，对比传统及现有合成数据集。

Result: BeyondWeb在14项基准测试中平均提升5.1pp和2.6pp，训练速度更快，小模型表现优于大模型。

Conclusion: 高质量合成数据需多因素联合优化，BeyondWeb展示了其潜力。

Abstract: Recent advances in large language model (LLM) pretraining have shown that
simply scaling data quantity eventually leads to diminishing returns, hitting a
data wall. In response, the use of synthetic data for pretraining has emerged
as a promising paradigm for pushing the frontier of performance. Despite this,
the factors affecting synthetic data quality remain poorly understood. In this
work, we introduce BeyondWeb, a synthetic data generation framework that
produces high-quality synthetic data for pretraining. BeyondWeb significantly
extends the capabilities of traditional web-scale datasets, outperforming
state-of-the-art synthetic pretraining datasets such as Cosmopedia and
Nemotron-CC's high-quality synthetic subset (Nemotron-Synth) by up to 5.1
percentage points (pp) and 2.6pp, respectively, when averaged across a suite of
14 benchmark evaluations. It delivers up to 7.7x faster training than open web
data and 2.7x faster than Nemotron-Synth. Remarkably, a 3B model trained for
180B tokens on BeyondWeb outperforms an 8B model trained for the same token
budget on Cosmopedia. We also present several insights from BeyondWeb on
synthetic data for pretraining: what drives its benefits, which data to
rephrase and how, and the impact of model size and family on data quality.
Overall, our work shows that there's no silver bullet for generating
high-quality synthetic pretraining data. The best outcomes require jointly
optimizing many factors, a challenging task that requires rigorous science and
practical expertise. Naive approaches can yield modest improvements,
potentially at great cost, while well-executed methods can yield transformative
improvements, as exemplified by BeyondWeb.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 公共预训练T2I模型虽然促进了模型的民主化，但用户面临如何选择最适合目标数据域的模型的挑战。目前缺乏针对预训练T2I模型的性能评估方法。

Method: M&C框架通过构建匹配图（包含模型和数据集节点，以及模型-数据和数据-数据边）和基于图嵌入特征的预测模型，选择最佳微调模型。

Result: 在10个T2I模型和32个数据集的实验中，M&C成功预测最佳模型的准确率为61.3%，其余情况下也能选择接近最佳性能的模型。

Conclusion: M&C为预训练T2I模型的快速选择提供了有效解决方案，显著减少了微调成本。

Abstract: Text-to-image (T2I) models based on diffusion and transformer architectures
advance rapidly. They are often pretrained on large corpora, and openly shared
on a model platform, such as HuggingFace. Users can then build up AI
applications, e.g., generating media contents, by adopting pretrained T2I
models and fine-tuning them on the target dataset. While public pretrained T2I
models facilitate the democratization of the models, users face a new
challenge: which model can be best fine-tuned based on the target data domain?
Model selection is well addressed in classification tasks, but little is known
in (pretrained) T2I models and their performance indication on the target
domain. In this paper, we propose the first model selection framework, M&C,
which enables users to efficiently choose a pretrained T2I model from a model
platform without exhaustively fine-tuning them all on the target dataset. The
core of M&C is a matching graph, which consists of: (i) nodes of available
models and profiled datasets, and (ii) edges of model-data and data-data pairs
capturing the fine-tuning performance and data similarity, respectively. We
then build a model that, based on the inputs of model/data feature, and,
critically, the graph embedding feature, extracted from the matching graph,
predicts the model achieving the best quality after fine-tuning for the target
domain. We evaluate M&C on choosing across ten T2I models for 32 datasets
against three baselines. Our results show that M&C successfully predicts the
best model for fine-tuning in 61.3% of the cases and a closely performing model
for the rest.

Result: 在数学推理任务中表现优于DAPO，熵和准确性均达SOTA。

Conclusion: CURE有效平衡探索与利用，性能提升显著。

Abstract: Recent advances in Reinforcement Learning with Verified Reward (RLVR) have
driven the emergence of more sophisticated cognitive behaviors in large
language models (LLMs), thereby enhancing their reasoning capabilities.
However, in prior RLVR pipelines, the repeated use of static initial-state
sampling drawn exactly from the dataset distribution during each sampling phase
produced overly deterministic, low diversity model behavior, which manifested
as rapid entropy collapse and hindered sustained performance gains during
prolonged training. To address this issue, we introduce CURE
(Critical-token-gUided Re concatenation for Entropy-collapse prevention), a
two-stage framework that balances exploration and exploitation. Specifically,
in the first stage, to deliberately steer the model toward novel yet coherent
contexts, we re-generate at high-entropy critical tokens and jointly optimize
the original and the branched trajectories. The further comparison with vanilla
DAPO shows that the regeneration process achieves a better performance on math
reasoning tasks while sustaining a high-level entropy degree for exploration.
In the second stage, we continue training with static initial-state sampling by
DAPO, intentionally placing the model in a familiar state to gradually
strengthen exploitation. Extensive experiments on Qwen-2.5-Math-7B show that,
compared to other RLVR methods, CURE achieves a 5% performance gain across six
math benchmarks, establishing state-of-the-art performance in both entropy and
accuracy. A series of experiments further validate the effectiveness of our
approach. Code is available at https://github.com/CURE-Project/CURE.

Motivation: 量化是提高神经网络效率的关键技术，但理论理解有限。此前研究主要集中在连续设置，无法直接应用于量化网络。

Method: 基于Borgs等人的数分割问题结果，推导量化随机子集和问题的新理论，并扩展SLTH框架到有限精度网络。

Result: 在量化设置下，离散神经网络可以被精确表示，且初始网络的过参数化界限是最优的。

Conclusion: 本文为量化神经网络提供了理论支持，扩展了SLTH的应用范围，并证明了量化网络的精确表示能力。

Abstract: Quantization is an essential technique for making neural networks more
efficient, yet our theoretical understanding of it remains limited. Previous
works demonstrated that extremely low-precision networks, such as binary
networks, can be constructed by pruning large, randomly-initialized networks,
and showed that the ratio between the size of the original and the pruned
networks is at most polylogarithmic.
  The specific pruning method they employed inspired a line of theoretical work
known as the Strong Lottery Ticket Hypothesis (SLTH), which leverages insights
from the Random Subset Sum Problem. However, these results primarily address
the continuous setting and cannot be applied to extend SLTH results to the
quantized setting.
  In this work, we build on foundational results by Borgs et al. on the Number
Partitioning Problem to derive new theoretical results for the Random Subset
Sum Problem in a quantized setting.
  Using these results, we then extend the SLTH framework to finite-precision
networks. While prior work on SLTH showed that pruning allows approximation of
a certain class of neural networks, we demonstrate that, in the quantized
setting, the analogous class of target discrete neural networks can be
represented exactly, and we prove optimal bounds on the necessary
overparameterization of the initial network as a function of the precision of
the target network.

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了观看时间偏差问题，为推荐系统提供了更可靠的偏好信号。

Abstract: Watch time is widely used as a proxy for user satisfaction in video
recommendation platforms. However, raw watch times are influenced by
confounding factors such as video duration, popularity, and individual user
behaviors, potentially distorting preference signals and resulting in biased
recommendation models. We propose a novel relative advantage debiasing
framework that corrects watch time by comparing it to empirically derived
reference distributions conditioned on user and item groups. This approach
yields a quantile-based preference signal and introduces a two-stage
architecture that explicitly separates distribution estimation from preference
learning. Additionally, we present distributional embeddings to efficiently
parameterize watch-time quantiles without requiring online sampling or storage
of historical data. Both offline and online experiments demonstrate significant
improvements in recommendation accuracy and robustness compared to existing
baseline methods.

Result: zono-conformal predictors比现有方法更高效且保守性更低，同时在测试数据上实现了相似的覆盖率。

Conclusion: zono-conformal prediction是一种高效且数据利用率高的不确定性量化方法，适用于非线性基预测器。

Abstract: Conformal prediction is a popular uncertainty quantification method that
augments a base predictor with prediction sets with statistically valid
coverage guarantees. However, current methods are often computationally
expensive and data-intensive, as they require constructing an uncertainty model
before calibration. Moreover, existing approaches typically represent the
prediction sets with intervals, which limits their ability to capture
dependencies in multi-dimensional outputs. We address these limitations by
introducing zono-conformal prediction, a novel approach inspired by interval
predictor models and reachset-conformant identification that constructs
prediction zonotopes with assured coverage. By placing zonotopic uncertainty
sets directly into the model of the base predictor, zono-conformal predictors
can be identified via a single, data-efficient linear program. While we can
apply zono-conformal prediction to arbitrary nonlinear base predictors, we
focus on feed-forward neural networks in this work. Aside from regression
tasks, we also construct optimal zono-conformal predictors in classification
settings where the output of an uncertain predictor is a set of possible
classes. We provide probabilistic coverage guarantees and present methods for
detecting outliers in the identification data. In extensive numerical
experiments, we show that zono-conformal predictors are less conservative than
interval predictor models and standard conformal prediction methods, while
achieving a similar coverage over the test data.

Result: 在POG数据集上，FGAT在精度、HR、召回率、NDCG和准确率上优于基线模型HFGN。

Conclusion: 结合多模态特征、层次图结构和注意力机制，显著提升个性化时尚推荐系统的准确性和效率。

Abstract: The rapid expansion of the fashion industry and the growing variety of
products have made it challenging for users to find compatible items on
e-commerce platforms. Effective fashion recommendation systems are crucial for
filtering irrelevant items and suggesting suitable ones. However,
simultaneously addressing outfit compatibility and personalized recommendations
remains a significant challenge, as these aspects are often treated
independently in existing studies, often overlooking the complex interactions
between items and user preferences. This research introduces a new framework
named FGAT, inspired by the HFGN model, which leverages graph neural networks
and graph attention mechanisms to tackle this issue. The proposed framework
constructs a three-tier hierarchical graph of users, outfits, and items,
integrating visual and textual features to simultaneously model outfit
compatibility and user preferences. A graph attention mechanism dynamically
weights node importance during representation propagation, enabling the capture
of key interactions and generating precise representations for both user
preferences and outfit compatibility. Evaluated on the POG dataset, FGAT
outperforms baseline models such as HFGN, achieving improved results in
precision, HR, recall, NDCG, and accuracy.These results demonstrate that
combining multimodal visual-textual features with a hierarchical graph
structure and attention mechanisms significantly enhances the accuracy and
efficiency of personalized fashion recommendation systems.

Conclusion: 贝叶斯规则是优化学习者在特定条件下的特例，信心为学习提供了更丰富的语言。

Abstract: We characterize a notion of confidence that arises in learning or updating
beliefs: the amount of trust one has in incoming information and its impact on
the belief state. This learner's confidence can be used alongside (and is
easily mistaken for) probability or likelihood, but it is fundamentally a
different concept -- one that captures many familiar concepts in the
literature, including learning rates and number of training epochs, Shafer's
weight of evidence, and Kalman gain. We formally axiomatize what it means to
learn with confidence, give two canonical ways of measuring confidence on a
continuum, and prove that confidence can always be represented in this way.
Under additional assumptions, we derive more compact representations of
confidence-based learning in terms of vector fields and loss functions. These
representations induce an extended language of compound "parallel"
observations. We characterize Bayes Rule as the special case of an optimizing
learner whose loss representation is a linear expectation.

Conclusion: 广义非正态正态分布为研究非高斯数据的条件独立性提供了一种新方法，其算法具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: For general non-Gaussian distributions, the covariance and precision matrices
do not encode the independence structure of the variables, as they do for the
multivariate Gaussian. This paper builds on previous work to show that for a
class of non-Gaussian distributions -- those derived from diagonal
transformations of a Gaussian -- information about the conditional independence
structure can still be inferred from the precision matrix, provided the data
meet certain criteria, analogous to the Gaussian case. We call such
transformations of the Gaussian as the generalized nonparanormal. The functions
that define these transformations are, in a broad sense, arbitrary. We also

Motivation: LIME和SHAP等解释方法被广泛用于评估模型偏见，但其易受对抗性操纵，可能掩盖有害偏见。研究旨在验证这些方法的脆弱性并探索改进策略。

Method: 复制COMPAS实验验证先前发现，引入模块化测试框架，系统评估增强和集成解释方法在不同性能分类器上的表现。

Result: 发现某些LIME/SHAP集成配置能显著提高偏见检测能力，优于原始方法。

Conclusion: 研究为高风险机器学习系统的透明部署提供了改进方向，强调了集成方法在增强解释鲁棒性方面的潜力。

Abstract: Post hoc explanation methods, such as LIME and SHAP, provide interpretable
insights into black-box classifiers and are increasingly used to assess model
biases and generalizability. However, these methods are vulnerable to
adversarial manipulation, potentially concealing harmful biases. Building on
the work of Slack et al. (2020), we investigate the susceptibility of LIME and
SHAP to biased models and evaluate strategies for improving robustness. We
first replicate the original COMPAS experiment to validate prior findings and
establish a baseline. We then introduce a modular testing framework enabling
systematic evaluation of augmented and ensemble explanation approaches across
classifiers of varying performance. Using this framework, we assess multiple
LIME/SHAP ensemble configurations on out-of-distribution models, comparing
their resistance to bias concealment against the original methods. Our results
identify configurations that substantially improve bias detection, highlighting
their potential for enhancing transparency in the deployment of high-stakes
machine learning systems.

Motivation: 现有方法通常忽略微生物组样本中分类群丰度的生物学重要性，导致嵌入表示不够准确。

Method: 提出丰度感知的Set Transformer变体，通过加权序列嵌入并应用自注意力聚合，生成样本级嵌入。

Result: 在真实微生物组分类任务中，该方法优于平均池化和未加权的Set Transformer，部分情况下达到完美性能。

Conclusion: 丰度感知聚合方法能够生成更鲁棒且生物学信息更丰富的微生物组表示，为相关任务提供了新思路。

Abstract: Microbiome sample representation to input into LLMs is essential for
downstream tasks such as phenotype prediction and environmental classification.
While prior studies have explored embedding-based representations of each
microbiome sample, most rely on simple averaging over sequence embeddings,
often overlooking the biological importance of taxa abundance. In this work, we
propose an abundance-aware variant of the Set Transformer to construct
fixed-size sample-level embeddings by weighting sequence embeddings according
to their relative abundance. Without modifying the model architecture, we
replicate embedding vectors proportional to their abundance and apply
self-attention-based aggregation. Our method outperforms average pooling and
unweighted Set Transformers on real-world microbiome classification tasks,
achieving perfect performance in some cases. These results demonstrate the
utility of abundance-aware aggregation for robust and biologically informed
microbiome representation. To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the
first approaches to integrate sequence-level abundance into Transformer-based
sample embeddings.

Result: 框架在多个应用中（如压缩PCA、压缩岭回归等）表现优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 压缩元学习框架为高效、隐私友好的学习提供了新方向。

Abstract: The rapid expansion in the size of new datasets has created a need for fast
and efficient parameter-learning techniques. Compressive learning is a
framework that enables efficient processing by using random, non-linear
features to project large-scale databases onto compact, information-preserving
representations whose dimensionality is independent of the number of samples
and can be easily stored, transferred, and processed. These database-level
summaries are then used to decode parameters of interest from the underlying
data distribution without requiring access to the original samples, offering an
efficient and privacy-friendly learning framework. However, both the encoding
and decoding techniques are typically randomized and data-independent, failing
to exploit the underlying structure of the data. In this work, we propose a
framework that meta-learns both the encoding and decoding stages of compressive
learning methods by using neural networks that provide faster and more accurate
systems than the current state-of-the-art approaches. To demonstrate the
potential of the presented Compressive Meta-Learning framework, we explore
multiple applications -- including neural network-based compressive PCA,
compressive ridge regression, compressive k-means, and autoencoders.

Conclusion: 多模态融合和时间加权损失策略有效提升了ICD编码早期预测的准确性。

Abstract: While the ICD code assignment problem has been widely studied, most works
have focused on post-discharge document classification. Models for early
forecasting of this information could be used for identifying health risks,
suggesting effective treatments, or optimizing resource allocation. To address
the challenge of predictive modeling using the limited information at the
beginning of a patient stay, we propose a multimodal system to fuse clinical
notes and tabular events captured in electronic health records. The model
integrates pre-trained encoders, feature pooling, and cross-modal attention to
learn optimal representations across modalities and balance their presence at
every temporal point. Moreover, we present a weighted temporal loss that
adjusts its contribution at each point in time. Experiments show that these
strategies enhance the early prediction model, outperforming the current
state-of-the-art systems.

Abstract: Optimization problems over discrete or quantized variables are very
challenging in general due to the combinatorial nature of their search space.
Piecewise-affine regularization (PAR) provides a flexible modeling and
computational framework for quantization based on continuous optimization. In
this work, we focus on the setting of supervised learning and investigate the
theoretical foundations of PAR from optimization and statistical perspectives.
First, we show that in the overparameterized regime, where the number of
parameters exceeds the number of samples, every critical point of the
PAR-regularized loss function exhibits a high degree of quantization. Second,
we derive closed-form proximal mappings for various (convex, quasi-convex, and
non-convex) PARs and show how to solve PAR-regularized problems using the
proximal gradient method, its accelerated variant, and the Alternating
Direction Method of Multipliers. Third, we study statistical guarantees of
PAR-regularized linear regression problems; specifically, we can approximate
classical formulations of $\ell_1$-, squared $\ell_2$-, and nonconvex
regularizations using PAR and obtain similar statistical guarantees with
quantized solutions.

Motivation: 在多源数据（如不同地点或群体）的机器学习任务中，需要确保预测不仅整体准确，还能在各源内可靠并保留源间差异。例如，难民安置计划需要针对不同地点生成差异化预测。

Method: CTRL结合了跨域残差学习和自适应池化/聚类技术，通过元学习方法优化数据数量与质量的权衡。

Conclusion: CTRL能有效提升多源数据下的预测性能，同时保留源间异质性，适用于实际应用如难民安置。

Abstract: Machine learning (ML) tasks often utilize large-scale data that is drawn from
several distinct sources, such as different locations, treatment arms, or
groups. In such settings, practitioners often desire predictions that not only
exhibit good overall accuracy, but also remain reliable within each source and
preserve the differences that matter across sources. For instance, several
asylum and refugee resettlement programs now use ML-based employment
predictions to guide where newly arriving families are placed within a host
country, which requires generating informative and differentiated predictions
for many and often small source locations. However, this task is made
challenging by several common characteristics of the data in these settings:
the presence of numerous distinct data sources, distributional shifts between
them, and substantial variation in sample sizes across sources. This paper
introduces Clustered Transfer Residual Learning (CTRL), a meta-learning method
that combines the strengths of cross-domain residual learning and adaptive
pooling/clustering in order to simultaneously improve overall accuracy and
preserve source-level heterogeneity. We provide theoretical results that
clarify how our objective navigates the trade-off between data quantity and
data quality. We evaluate CTRL alongside other state-of-the-art benchmarks on 5
large-scale datasets. This includes a dataset from the national asylum program
in Switzerland, where the algorithmic geographic assignment of asylum seekers
is currently being piloted. CTRL consistently outperforms the benchmarks across
several key metrics and when using a range of different base learners.

Conclusion: NeuralKDB通过分布表示学习有效解决了传统贝叶斯网络分类器的局限性，为高阶特征依赖建模提供了新思路。

Abstract: Bayesian network classifiers provide a feasible solution to tabular data
classification, with a number of merits like high time and memory efficiency,
and great explainability. However, due to the parameter explosion and data
sparsity issues, Bayesian network classifiers are restricted to low-order
feature dependency modeling, making them struggle in extrapolating the
occurrence probabilities of complex real-world data. In this paper, we propose
a novel paradigm to design high-order Bayesian network classifiers, by learning
distributional representations for feature values, as what has been done in
word embedding and graph representation learning. The learned distributional
representations are encoded with the semantic relatedness between different
features through their observed co-occurrence patterns in training data, which
then serve as a hallmark to extrapolate the occurrence probabilities of new
test samples. As a classifier design realization, we remake the K-dependence
Bayesian classifier (KDB) by extending it into a neural version, i.e.,
NeuralKDB, where a novel neural network architecture is designed to learn
distributional representations of feature values and parameterize the
conditional probabilities between interdependent features. A stochastic
gradient descent based algorithm is designed to train the NeuralKDB model
efficiently. Extensive classification experiments on 60 UCI datasets
demonstrate that the proposed NeuralKDB classifier excels in capturing
high-order feature dependencies and significantly outperforms the conventional
Bayesian network classifiers, as well as other competitive classifiers,
including two neural network based classifiers without distributional
representation learning.

Motivation: 随着边缘智能的发展，IoT设备需要处理异构多模态数据，但设备不稳定导致数据收集时的模态数量与质量不平衡，影响了学习性能。

Method: 作者提出了Modality Quantity and Quality Rebalanced (QQR)算法，通过原型学习在训练过程中动态平衡模态。

Result: 在两个真实多模态数据集上的实验表明，QQR算法在模态不平衡条件下显著优于基准方法。

Conclusion: QQR算法有效解决了MMO-FL中的模态不平衡问题，提升了学习性能。

Abstract: The Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystem produces massive volumes of multimodal
data from diverse sources, including sensors, cameras, and microphones. With
advances in edge intelligence, IoT devices have evolved from simple data
acquisition units into computationally capable nodes, enabling localized
processing of heterogeneous multimodal data. This evolution necessitates
distributed learning paradigms that can efficiently handle such data.
Furthermore, the continuous nature of data generation and the limited storage
capacity of edge devices demand an online learning framework. Multimodal Online
Federated Learning (MMO-FL) has emerged as a promising approach to meet these
requirements. However, MMO-FL faces new challenges due to the inherent
instability of IoT devices, which often results in modality quantity and
quality imbalance (QQI) during data collection. In this work, we systematically
investigate the impact of QQI within the MMO-FL framework and present a
comprehensive theoretical analysis quantifying how both types of imbalance
degrade learning performance. To address these challenges, we propose the
Modality Quantity and Quality Rebalanced (QQR) algorithm, a prototype learning
based method designed to operate in parallel with the training process.
Extensive experiments on two real-world multimodal datasets show that the
proposed QQR algorithm consistently outperforms benchmarks under modality
imbalance conditions with promising learning performance.

Result: 在图像和多组学数据上，模型在预测和插补性能上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法有效解决了缺失视图和标签问题，提升了性能。

Abstract: Multi-view learning is widely applied to real-life datasets, such as multiple
omics biological data, but it often suffers from both missing views and missing
labels. Prior probabilistic approaches addressed the missing view problem by
using a product-of-experts scheme to aggregate representations from present
views and achieved superior performance over deterministic classifiers, using
the information bottleneck (IB) principle. However, the IB framework is
inherently fully supervised and cannot leverage unlabeled data. In this work,
we propose a semi-supervised generative model that utilizes both labeled and
unlabeled samples in a unified framework. Our method maximizes the likelihood
of unlabeled samples to learn a latent space shared with the IB on labeled
data. We also perform cross-view mutual information maximization in the latent
space to enhance the extraction of shared information across views. Compared to
existing approaches, our model achieves better predictive and imputation
performance on both image and multi-omics data with missing views and limited
labeled samples.

Conclusion: QBM-VAE展示了量子优势在深度学习中的应用，为开发混合量子AI模型提供了可转移的蓝图。

Abstract: A fundamental limitation of probabilistic deep learning is its predominant
reliance on Gaussian priors. This simplistic assumption prevents models from
accurately capturing the complex, non-Gaussian landscapes of natural data,
particularly in demanding domains like complex biological data, severely
hindering the fidelity of the model for scientific discovery. The
physically-grounded Boltzmann distribution offers a more expressive
alternative, but it is computationally intractable on classical computers. To
date, quantum approaches have been hampered by the insufficient qubit scale and
operational stability required for the iterative demands of deep learning.
Here, we bridge this gap by introducing the Quantum Boltzmann
Machine-Variational Autoencoder (QBM-VAE), a large-scale and long-time stable
hybrid quantum-classical architecture. Our framework leverages a quantum
processor for efficient sampling from the Boltzmann distribution, enabling its
use as a powerful prior within a deep generative model. Applied to
million-scale single-cell datasets from multiple sources, the QBM-VAE generates
a latent space that better preserves complex biological structures,
consistently outperforming conventional Gaussian-based deep learning models
like VAE and SCVI in essential tasks such as omics data integration, cell-type
classification, and trajectory inference. It also provides a typical example of
introducing a physics priori into deep learning to drive the model to acquire
scientific discovery capabilities that breaks through data limitations. This
work provides the demonstration of a practical quantum advantage in deep
learning on a large-scale scientific problem and offers a transferable
blueprint for developing hybrid quantum AI models.

Conclusion: 该框架为参数化动态系统提供了可扩展和泛化的学习方案，克服了传统方法的局限性。

Abstract: Structure-preserving approaches to dynamics modeling have demonstrated great
potential for modeling physical systems due to their strong inductive biases
that enforce conservation laws and dissipative behavior. However, the resulting
models are typically trained for fixed system configurations, requiring
explicit knowledge of system parameters as well as costly retraining for each
new set of parameters -- a major limitation in many-query or parameter-varying
scenarios. Meta-learning offers a potential solution, but existing approaches
like optimization-based meta-learning often suffer from training instability or
limited generalization capability. Inspired by ideas from computer vision, we
introduce a modulation-based meta-learning framework that directly conditions
structure-preserving models on compact latent representations of potentially
unknown system parameters, avoiding the need for gray-box system knowledge and
explicit optimization during adaptation. Through the application of novel
modulation strategies to parametric energy-conserving and dissipative systems,
we enable scalable and generalizable learning across parametric families of
dynamical systems. Experiments on standard benchmark problems demonstrate that
our approach achieves accurate predictions in few-shot learning settings,
without compromising on the essential physical constraints necessary for
dynamical stability and effective generalization performance across parameter
space.

Motivation: 尽管后期风险评估通常更精确，但临床需要尽早进行可靠的评估。因此，研究目标是改进早期风险评估的预测能力。

Method: BFF将不同时间窗口视为不同模态，利用所有可用数据训练模型，并通过对比框架从后期阶段“借用”信息以监督早期阶段的学习。

Result: 在两个真实世界的儿科结果预测任务中验证了BFF，结果显示早期风险评估性能有显著提升。

Conclusion: BFF通过多模态对比学习有效提升了早期儿科风险评估的预测性能，具有临床实用价值。

Abstract: Risk assessments for a pediatric population are often conducted across
multiple stages. For example, clinicians may evaluate risks prenatally, at
birth, and during Well-Child visits. Although predictions made at later stages
typically achieve higher precision, it is clinically desirable to make reliable
risk assessments as early as possible. Therefore, this study focuses on
improving prediction performance in early-stage risk assessments. Our solution,
\textbf{Borrowing From the Future (BFF)}, is a contrastive multi-modal
framework that treats each time window as a distinct modality. In BFF, a model
is trained on all available data throughout the time while performing a risk
assessment using up-to-date information. This contrastive framework allows the
model to ``borrow'' informative signals from later stages (e.g., Well-Child
visits) to implicitly supervise the learning at earlier stages (e.g.,
prenatal/birth stages). We validate BFF on two real-world pediatric outcome
prediction tasks, demonstrating consistent improvements in early risk
assessments. The code is available at https://github.com/scotsun/bff.

Abstract: Explanations of cognitive behavior often appeal to computations over
representations. What does it take for a system to implement a given
computation over suitable representational vehicles within that system? We
argue that the language of causality -- and specifically the theory of causal
abstraction -- provides a fruitful lens on this topic. Drawing on current
discussions in deep learning with artificial neural networks, we illustrate how
classical themes in the philosophy of computation and cognition resurface in
contemporary machine learning. We offer an account of computational
implementation grounded in causal abstraction, and examine the role for
representation in the resulting picture. We argue that these issues are most
profitably explored in connection with generalization and prediction.

Abstract: There has been a growing interest in developing diffusion-based Graph Neural
Networks (GNNs), building on the connections between message passing mechanisms
in GNNs and physical diffusion processes. However, existing methods suffer from
three critical limitations: (1) they rely on homogeneous diffusion with static
dynamics, limiting adaptability to diverse graph structures; (2) their depth is
constrained by computational overhead and diminishing interpretability; and (3)
theoretical understanding of their convergence behavior remains limited. To
address these challenges, we propose GODNF, a Generalized Opinion Dynamics
Neural Framework, which unifies multiple opinion dynamics models into a
principled, trainable diffusion mechanism. Our framework captures heterogeneous
diffusion patterns and temporal dynamics via node-specific behavior modeling
and dynamic neighborhood influence, while ensuring efficient and interpretable
message propagation even at deep layers. We provide a rigorous theoretical
analysis demonstrating GODNF's ability to model diverse convergence
configurations. Extensive empirical evaluations of node classification and
influence estimation tasks confirm GODNF's superiority over state-of-the-art
GNNs.

Abstract: With the intensification of global climate change, accurate prediction of air
quality indicators, especially PM2.5 concentration, has become increasingly
important in fields such as environmental protection, public health, and urban

model based on a hybrid CNN-LSTM architecture. The model effectively combines
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for local spatial feature extraction and
Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for modeling temporal dependencies in
time series data. Using a multivariate dataset collected from an industrial
area in Beijing between 2010 and 2015 -- which includes hourly records of PM2.5
concentration, temperature, dew point, pressure, wind direction, wind speed,
and precipitation -- the model predicts the average PM2.5 concentration over
6-hour intervals. Experimental results show that the model achieves a root mean
square error (RMSE) of 5.236, outperforming traditional time series models in
both accuracy and generalization. This demonstrates its strong potential in
real-world applications such as air pollution early warning systems. However,
due to the complexity of multivariate inputs, the model demands high
computational resources, and its ability to handle diverse atmospheric factors
still requires optimization. Future work will focus on enhancing scalability
and expanding support for more complex multivariate weather prediction tasks.

Abstract: This paper presents an enhanced version of the Interactive Voting-Based Map
Matching algorithm, designed to efficiently process trajectories with varying
sampling rates. The main aim is to reconstruct GPS trajectories with high
accuracy, independent of input data quality. Building upon the original
algorithm, developed exclusively for aligning GPS signals to road networks, we
extend its capabilities by integrating trajectory imputation. Our improvements
also include the implementation of a distance-bounded interactive voting
strategy to reduce computational complexity, as well as modifications to
address missing data in the road network. Furthermore, we incorporate a
custom-built asset derived from OpenStreetMap, enabling this approach to be
smoothly applied in any geographic region covered by OpenStreetMap's road
network. These advancements preserve the core strengths of the original
algorithm while significantly extending its applicability to diverse real-world
scenarios.

Abstract: We introduce RegimeNAS, a novel differentiable architecture search framework
specifically designed to enhance cryptocurrency trading performance by
explicitly integrating market regime awareness. Addressing the limitations of
static deep learning models in highly dynamic financial environments, RegimeNAS
features three core innovations: (1) a theoretically grounded Bayesian search
space optimizing architectures with provable convergence properties; (2)
specialized, dynamically activated neural modules (Volatility, Trend, and Range
blocks) tailored for distinct market conditions; and (3) a multi-objective loss
function incorporating market-specific penalties (e.g., volatility matching,
transition smoothness) alongside mathematically enforced Lipschitz stability
constraints. Regime identification leverages multi-head attention across
multiple timeframes for improved accuracy and uncertainty estimation. Rigorous
empirical evaluation on extensive real-world cryptocurrency data demonstrates
that RegimeNAS significantly outperforms state-of-the-art benchmarks, achieving
an 80.3% Mean Absolute Error reduction compared to the best traditional
recurrent baseline and converging substantially faster (9 vs. 50+ epochs).
Ablation studies and regime-specific analysis confirm the critical contribution
of each component, particularly the regime-aware adaptation mechanism. This
work underscores the imperative of embedding domain-specific knowledge, such as
market regimes, directly within the NAS process to develop robust and adaptive
models for challenging financial applications.

Result: RTE在多个基准测试中表现优于现有方法，重塑了SNNs的内部鲁棒性景观。

Conclusion: 研究强调了时间结构在对抗学习中的重要性，为构建鲁棒的脉冲模型提供了理论基础。

Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) offer a promising direction for
energy-efficient and brain-inspired computing, yet their vulnerability to
adversarial perturbations remains poorly understood. In this work, we revisit
the adversarial robustness of SNNs through the lens of temporal ensembling,
treating the network as a collection of evolving sub-networks across discrete
timesteps. This formulation uncovers two critical but underexplored
challenges-the fragility of individual temporal sub-networks and the tendency
for adversarial vulnerabilities to transfer across time. To overcome these
limitations, we propose Robust Temporal self-Ensemble (RTE), a training
framework that improves the robustness of each sub-network while reducing the
temporal transferability of adversarial perturbations. RTE integrates both
objectives into a unified loss and employs a stochastic sampling strategy for
efficient optimization. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks
demonstrate that RTE consistently outperforms existing training methods in
robust-accuracy trade-off. Additional analyses reveal that RTE reshapes the
internal robustness landscape of SNNs, leading to more resilient and temporally
diversified decision boundaries. Our study highlights the importance of
temporal structure in adversarial learning and offers a principled foundation
for building robust spiking models.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着DNN模型在现代软件系统中的广泛应用，训练成本高昂成为挑战。现有模块化方法难以适应多样化的DNN架构和大型模型。

Method: 提出NeMo方法，基于对比学习和复合损失函数，在神经元级别进行模块化训练，适用于Transformer和CNN等多种架构。

Result: 实验表明，NeMo在两种Transformer和四种CNN模型上表现优异，模块分类准确率平均提升1.72%，模块大小减少58.10%。

Conclusion: NeMo为DNN模块化提供了可扩展且通用的解决方案，适用于实际场景，具有广泛应用潜力。

Abstract: With the growing incorporation of deep neural network (DNN) models into
modern software systems, the prohibitive construction costs have become a
significant challenge. Model reuse has been widely applied to reduce training
costs, but indiscriminately reusing entire models may incur significant
inference overhead. Consequently, DNN modularization has gained attention,
enabling module reuse by decomposing DNN models. The emerging
modularizing-while-training (MwT) paradigm, which incorporates modularization
into training, outperforms modularizing-after-training approaches. However,
existing MwT methods focus on small-scale CNN models at the convolutional
kernel level and struggle with diverse DNNs and large-scale models,
particularly Transformer-based models. To address these limitations, we propose
NeMo, a scalable and generalizable MwT approach. NeMo operates at the neuron
level fundamental component common to all DNNs-ensuring applicability to
Transformers and various architectures. We design a contrastive learning-based
modular training method with an effective composite loss function, enabling
scalability to large-scale models. Comprehensive experiments on two
Transformer-based models and four CNN models across two classification datasets
demonstrate NeMo's superiority over state-of-the-art MwT methods. Results show
average gains of 1.72% in module classification accuracy and 58.10% reduction
in module size, demonstrating efficacy across both CNN and large-scale
Transformer-based models. A case study on open-source projects shows NeMo's
potential benefits in practical scenarios, offering a promising approach for
scalable and generalizable DNN modularization.

Result: 实验验证了模型在转导和归纳学习设置下的有效性。

Conclusion: HS-GPPT通过频谱对齐实现了高效知识迁移，适用于不同同质性图。

Abstract: Graph ``pre-training and prompt-tuning'' aligns downstream tasks with
pre-trained objectives to enable efficient knowledge transfer under limited
supervision. However, existing methods rely on homophily-based low-frequency
knowledge, failing to handle diverse spectral distributions in real-world
graphs with varying homophily. Our theoretical analysis reveals a spectral
specificity principle: optimal knowledge transfer requires alignment between
pre-trained spectral filters and the intrinsic spectrum of downstream graphs.
Under limited supervision, large spectral gaps between pre-training and
downstream tasks impede effective adaptation. To bridge this gap, we propose
the HS-GPPT model, a novel framework that ensures spectral alignment throughout
both pre-training and prompt-tuning. We utilize a hybrid spectral filter
backbone and local-global contrastive learning to acquire abundant spectral
knowledge. Then we design prompt graphs to align the spectral distribution with
pretexts, facilitating spectral knowledge transfer across homophily and
heterophily. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness under both
transductive and inductive learning settings. Our code is available at

Motivation: 尽管大语言模型在复杂推理任务中表现优异，但其依赖标注数据且无监督适应性不足，测试时强化学习（TTRL）虽能自优化，但面临高推理成本和早期估计偏差等挑战。

Method: 引入熵基机制，包括ETMR（熵分叉树多数展开）和EAR（熵基优势重塑），以优化探索-利用平衡。

Conclusion: 该方法有效平衡了推理效率、多样性和估计稳健性，推动了开放域推理任务的无监督强化学习发展。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models have yielded significant
improvements in complex reasoning tasks such as mathematics and programming.
However, these models remain heavily dependent on annotated data and exhibit
limited adaptability in unsupervised scenarios. To address these limitations,
test-time reinforcement learning (TTRL) has been proposed, which enables
self-optimization by leveraging model-generated pseudo-labels. Despite its
promise, TTRL faces several key challenges, including high inference costs due
to parallel rollouts and early-stage estimation bias that fosters
overconfidence, reducing output diversity and causing performance plateaus. To
address these challenges, we introduce an entropy-based mechanism to enhance
the exploration-exploitation balance in test-time reinforcement learning
through two strategies: Entropy-fork Tree Majority Rollout (ETMR) and
Entropy-based Advantage Reshaping (EAR). Compared with the baseline, our
approach enables Llama3.1-8B to achieve a 68 percent relative improvement in
Pass at 1 metric on the AIME 2024 benchmark, while consuming only 60 percent of
the rollout tokens budget. This highlights our method's ability to effectively
optimize the trade-off between inference efficiency, diversity, and estimation
robustness, thereby advancing unsupervised reinforcement learning for
open-domain reasoning tasks.

Conclusion: TACP和sTACP显著改善了尾部类别的覆盖率，提升了预测集的可靠性。

Abstract: Conformal Prediction (CP) is a popular method for uncertainty quantification
that converts a pretrained model's point prediction into a prediction set, with
the set size reflecting the model's confidence. Although existing CP methods
are guaranteed to achieve marginal coverage, they often exhibit imbalanced
coverage across classes under long-tail label distributions, tending to over
cover the head classes at the expense of under covering the remaining tail
classes. This under coverage is particularly concerning, as it undermines the
reliability of the prediction sets for minority classes, even with coverage
ensured on average. In this paper, we propose the Tail-Aware Conformal
Prediction (TACP) method to mitigate the under coverage of the tail classes by
utilizing the long-tail structure and narrowing the head-tail coverage gap.
Theoretical analysis shows that it consistently achieves a smaller head-tail
coverage gap than standard methods. To further improve coverage balance across
all classes, we introduce an extension of TACP: soft TACP (sTACP) via a
reweighting mechanism. The proposed framework can be combined with various
non-conformity scores, and experiments on multiple long-tail benchmark datasets
demonstrate the effectiveness of our methods.

Conclusion: PTSM通过解耦神经表征，在非稳态神经生理场景中实现了个性化与可迁移的解码。

Abstract: Cross-subject electroencephalography (EEG) decoding remains a fundamental
challenge in brain-computer interface (BCI) research due to substantial
inter-subject variability and the scarcity of subject-invariant
representations. This paper proposed PTSM (Physiology-aware and Task-invariant
Spatio-temporal Modeling), a novel framework for interpretable and robust EEG
decoding across unseen subjects. PTSM employs a dual-branch masking mechanism
that independently learns personalized and shared spatio-temporal patterns,
enabling the model to preserve individual-specific neural characteristics while
extracting task-relevant, population-shared features. The masks are factorized
across temporal and spatial dimensions, allowing fine-grained modulation of
dynamic EEG patterns with low computational overhead. To further address
representational entanglement, PTSM enforces information-theoretic constraints
that decompose latent embeddings into orthogonal task-related and
subject-related subspaces. The model is trained end-to-end via a
multi-objective loss integrating classification, contrastive, and
disentanglement objectives. Extensive experiments on cross-subject motor
imagery datasets demonstrate that PTSM achieves strong zero-shot
generalization, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines without
subject-specific calibration. Results highlight the efficacy of disentangled
neural representations for achieving both personalized and transferable
decoding in non-stationary neurophysiological settings.

Method: 提出最小化替代损失，结合可微优化层（如DYS-Net），高效计算梯度和解。

Result: 实验显示，该方法在遗憾最小化和训练效率上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 最小化替代损失结合可微优化层是DFL的有效策略，显著提升性能与效率。

Abstract: Decision-focused learning (DFL) trains a machine learning (ML) model to
predict parameters of an optimization problem, to directly minimize decision
regret, i.e., maximize decision quality. Gradient-based DFL requires computing
the derivative of the solution to the optimization problem with respect to the
predicted parameters. However, for many optimization problems, such as linear
programs (LPs), the gradient of the regret with respect to the predicted
parameters is zero almost everywhere. Existing gradient-based DFL approaches
for LPs try to circumvent this issue in one of two ways: (a) smoothing the LP
into a differentiable optimization problem by adding a quadratic regularizer
and then minimizing the regret directly or (b) minimizing surrogate losses that
have informative (sub)gradients. In this paper, we show that the former
approach still results in zero gradients, because even after smoothing the
regret remains constant across large regions of the parameter space. To address
this, we propose minimizing surrogate losses -- even when a differentiable
optimization layer is used and regret can be minimized directly. Our
experiments demonstrate that minimizing surrogate losses allows differentiable
optimization layers to achieve regret comparable to or better than
surrogate-loss based DFL methods. Further, we demonstrate that this also holds
for DYS-Net, a recently proposed differentiable optimization technique for LPs,
that computes approximate solutions and gradients through operations that can
be performed using feedforward neural network layers. Because DYS-Net executes
the forward and the backward pass very efficiently, by minimizing surrogate
losses using DYS-Net, we are able to attain regret on par with the
state-of-the-art while reducing training time by a significant margin.

Motivation: 由于植树项目的碳汇效果常由开发者自行报告或缺乏外部验证，数据可靠性和项目诚信受到质疑，研究旨在提高自愿碳市场的透明度。

Method: 利用主数据和卫星图像等辅助数据，构建全球植树项目数据集，并引入LDIS指标评估地理数据完整性。

Result: 79%的地理标记种植点至少1项LDIS指标不合格，15%的项目缺乏可读的地理数据。

Conclusion: 数据集不仅提升自愿碳市场的问责性，还可作为计算机视觉任务的训练数据。

Abstract: Afforestation and reforestation are popular strategies for mitigating climate
change by enhancing carbon sequestration. However, the effectiveness of these
efforts is often self-reported by project developers, or certified through
processes with limited external validation. This leads to concerns about data
reliability and project integrity. In response to increasing scrutiny of
voluntary carbon markets, this study presents a dataset on global afforestation
and reforestation efforts compiled from primary (meta-)information and
augmented with time-series satellite imagery and other secondary data. Our
dataset covers 1,289,068 planting sites from 45,628 projects spanning 33 years.
Since any remote sensing-based validation effort relies on the integrity of a
planting site's geographic boundary, this dataset introduces a standardized
assessment of the provided site-level location information, which we summarize
in one easy-to-communicate key indicator: LDIS -- the Location Data Integrity
Score. We find that approximately 79\% of the georeferenced planting sites
monitored fail on at least 1 out of 10 LDIS indicators, while 15\% of the
monitored projects lack machine-readable georeferenced data in the first place.
In addition to enhancing accountability in the voluntary carbon market, the
presented dataset also holds value as training data for e.g. computer
vision-related tasks with millions of linked Sentinel-2 and Planetscope
satellite images.

Result: 理论分析和实验表明，HGD在多种不平衡数据流场景中表现优异，具有高效性和有效性。

Conclusion: HGD是一种简单高效的解决方案，适用于在线学习中的类别不平衡问题。

Abstract: Many real-world data are sequentially collected over time and often exhibit
skewed class distributions, resulting in imbalanced data streams. While
existing approaches have explored several strategies, such as resampling and
reweighting, for imbalanced data stream learning, our work distinguishes itself
by addressing the imbalance problem through training modification, particularly
focusing on gradient descent techniques. We introduce the harmonized gradient
descent (HGD) algorithm, which aims to equalize the norms of gradients across
different classes. By ensuring the gradient norm balance, HGD mitigates
under-fitting for minor classes and achieves balanced online learning. Notably,
HGD operates in a streamlined implementation process, requiring no data-buffer,
extra parameters, or prior knowledge, making it applicable to any learning
models utilizing gradient descent for optimization. Theoretical analysis, based
on a few common and mild assumptions, shows that HGD achieves a satisfied
sub-linear regret bound. The proposed algorithm are compared with the commonly
used online imbalance learning methods under several imbalanced data stream
scenarios. Extensive experimental evaluations demonstrate the efficiency and
effectiveness of HGD in learning imbalanced data streams.

Method: 提出CHORD框架，将SFT作为动态加权辅助目标融入RL过程，采用全局和细粒度双控制机制。

Result: 实验表明CHORD实现了稳定高效的学习过程，显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: CHORD通过动态权重有效协调专家数据和探索，为后续研究提供了新思路。

Abstract: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) are two
prominent post-training paradigms for refining the capabilities and aligning
the behavior of Large Language Models (LLMs). Existing approaches that
integrate SFT and RL often face the risk of disrupting established model
patterns and inducing overfitting to expert data. To address this, we present a
novel investigation into the unified view of SFT and RL through an off-policy
versus on-policy lens. We propose CHORD, a framework for the Controllable
Harmonization of On- and Off-Policy Reinforcement Learning via Dynamic
Weighting, which reframes SFT not as a separate stage but as a dynamically
weighted auxiliary objective within the on-policy RL process. Based on an
analysis of off-policy expert data's influence at both holistic and granular
levels, we incorporate a dual-control mechanism in CHORD. Specifically, the
framework first employs a global coefficient to holistically guide the
transition from off-policy imitation to on-policy exploration, and then applies
a token-wise weighting function that enables granular learning from expert
tokens, which preserves on-policy exploration and mitigates disruption from
off-policy data. We conduct extensive experiments on widely used benchmarks,
providing empirical evidence that CHORD achieves a stable and efficient
learning process. By effectively harmonizing off-policy expert data with
on-policy exploration, CHORD demonstrates significant improvements over
baselines. We release the implementation at
https://github.com/modelscope/Trinity-RFT/tree/main/examples/mix_chord to
inspire further research.

Conclusion: 结论强调了解释算法的局限性，并提出了改进方向，对AI的高风险应用和监管具有重要影响。

Abstract: Many researchers have suggested that local post-hoc explanation algorithms
can be used to gain insights into the behavior of complex machine learning
models. However, theoretical guarantees about such algorithms only exist for
simple decision functions, and it is unclear whether and under which
assumptions similar results might exist for complex models. In this paper, we
introduce a general, learning-theory-based framework for what it means for an
explanation to provide information about a decision function. We call an
explanation informative if it serves to reduce the complexity of the space of
plausible decision functions. With this approach, we show that many popular
explanation algorithms are not informative when applied to complex decision
functions, providing a rigorous mathematical rejection of the idea that it
should be possible to explain any model. We then derive conditions under which
different explanation algorithms become informative. These are often stronger
than what one might expect. For example, gradient explanations and
counterfactual explanations are non-informative with respect to the space of
differentiable functions, and SHAP and anchor explanations are not informative
with respect to the space of decision trees. Based on these results, we discuss
how explanation algorithms can be modified to become informative. While the
proposed analysis of explanation algorithms is mathematical, we argue that it
holds strong implications for the practical applicability of these algorithms,
particularly for auditing, regulation, and high-risk applications of AI.

Conclusion: DFA通过融合奖励和偏好，简化建模步骤，显著提升强化学习性能，尤其在偏好数据有限时表现突出。

Abstract: We present Dual-Feedback Actor (DFA), a reinforcement learning algorithm that
fuses both individual rewards and pairwise preferences (if available) into a
single update rule. DFA uses the policy's log-probabilities directly to model
the preference probability, avoiding a separate reward-modeling step.
Preferences can be provided by human-annotators (at state-level or
trajectory-level) or be synthesized online from Q-values stored in an
off-policy replay buffer. Under a Bradley-Terry model, we prove that minimizing
DFA's preference loss recovers the entropy-regularized Soft Actor-Critic (SAC)
policy. Our simulation results show that DFA trained on generated preferences
matches or exceeds SAC on six control environments and demonstrates a more
stable training process. With only a semi-synthetic preference dataset under
Bradley-Terry model, our algorithm outperforms reward-modeling reinforcement
learning from human feedback (RLHF) baselines in a stochastic GridWorld and
approaches the performance of an oracle with true rewards.

Conclusion: 提出的曲率提升策略为图学习中的长距离信息传递问题提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks are highly effective at learning from relational data,
leveraging node and edge features while maintaining the symmetries inherent to
graph structures. However, many real-world systems, such as social or
biological networks, exhibit complex interactions that are more naturally
represented by higher-order topological domains. The emerging field of
Geometric and Topological Deep Learning addresses this challenge by introducing
methods that utilize and benefit from higher-order structures. Central to TDL
is the concept of lifting, which transforms data representations from basic
graph forms to more expressive topologies before the application of GNN models
for learning. In this work, we propose a structural lifting strategy using
Forman-Ricci curvature, which defines an edge-based network characteristic
based on Riemannian geometry. Curvature reveals local and global properties of
a graph, such as a network's backbones, i.e. coarse, structure-preserving graph
geometries that form connections between major communities - most suitably
represented as hyperedges to model information flows between clusters across
large distances in the network. To this end, our approach provides a remedy to
the problem of information distortion in message passing across long distances
and graph bottlenecks - a phenomenon known in graph learning as over-squashing.

TL;DR: GraphOracle是一种新型自解释图神经网络框架，旨在生成和评估类级解释，解决了现有方法在类级解释上的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 提升图神经网络（GNNs）的可解释性，确保其安全公平部署，并解决现有方法（如ProtGNN和PGIB）在类级解释上的局限性。

Method: 联合学习GNN分类器和一组稀疏子图，提出集成训练方法，并通过掩码评估策略验证。

Result: GraphOracle在忠实性、可解释性和可扩展性上优于现有方法，避免了计算瓶颈。

Conclusion: GraphOracle是GNN中忠实类级自解释的实用解决方案。

Abstract: Enhancing the interpretability of graph neural networks (GNNs) is crucial to
ensure their safe and fair deployment. Recent work has introduced
self-explainable GNNs that generate explanations as part of training, improving
both faithfulness and efficiency. Some of these models, such as ProtGNN and
PGIB, learn class-specific prototypes, offering a potential pathway toward
class-level explanations. However, their evaluations focus solely on
instance-level explanations, leaving open the question of whether these
prototypes meaningfully generalize across instances of the same class. In this
paper, we introduce GraphOracle, a novel self-explainable GNN framework
designed to generate and evaluate class-level explanations for GNNs. Our model
jointly learns a GNN classifier and a set of structured, sparse subgraphs that
are discriminative for each class. We propose a novel integrated training that
captures graph$\unicode{x2013}$subgraph$\unicode{x2013}$prediction dependencies
efficiently and faithfully, validated through a masking-based evaluation
strategy. This strategy enables us to retroactively assess whether prior
methods like ProtGNN and PGIB deliver effective class-level explanations. Our
results show that they do not. In contrast, GraphOracle achieves superior
fidelity, explainability, and scalability across a range of graph
classification tasks. We further demonstrate that GraphOracle avoids the
computational bottlenecks of previous methods$\unicode{x2014}$like Monte Carlo
Tree Search$\unicode{x2014}$by using entropy-regularized subgraph selection and
lightweight random walk extraction, enabling faster and more scalable training.
These findings position GraphOracle as a practical and principled solution for
faithful class-level self-explainability in GNNs.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种名为HXAI的框架，通过将解释嵌入数据分析的每个阶段，并针对不同用户需求定制解释，以提高AI模型的透明度和可信度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI模型被视为‘黑箱’，传统解释方法仅关注单个预测，忽略了上下游决策和质量检查，导致用户对AI的信任不足。

Method: HXAI框架整合了数据分析的六个组件（数据、分析设置、学习过程、模型输出、模型质量、通信渠道），并通过112个问题库和用户调查，结合人类解释理论、人机交互原则和实证研究，设计清晰、可操作的解释。

Result: HXAI提供了一个全面的分类法，减少了术语歧义，并支持对现有工具链的严格覆盖分析。此外，展示了基于大语言模型的AI代理如何协调多种解释技术，生成针对特定利益相关者的叙述。

Conclusion: HXAI通过跨学科融合和实际项目经验，提出了一种端到端的透明、可信和负责任AI部署的新视角。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence is reshaping science and industry, yet many users
still regard its models as opaque "black boxes". Conventional explainable
artificial-intelligence methods clarify individual predictions but overlook the
upstream decisions and downstream quality checks that determine whether
insights can be trusted. In this work, we present Holistic Explainable
Artificial Intelligence (HXAI), a user-centric framework that embeds
explanation into every stage of the data-analysis workflow and tailors those
explanations to users. HXAI unifies six components (data, analysis set-up,
learning process, model output, model quality, communication channel) into a
single taxonomy and aligns each component with the needs of domain experts,
data analysts and data scientists. A 112-item question bank covers these needs;
our survey of contemporary tools highlights critical coverage gaps. Grounded in
theories of human explanation, principles from human-computer interaction and
findings from empirical user studies, HXAI identifies the characteristics that
make explanations clear, actionable and cognitively manageable. A comprehensive
taxonomy operationalises these insights, reducing terminological ambiguity and
enabling rigorous coverage analysis of existing toolchains. We further
demonstrate how AI agents that embed large-language models can orchestrate
diverse explanation techniques, translating technical artifacts into
stakeholder-specific narratives that bridge the gap between AI developers and
domain experts. Departing from traditional surveys or perspective articles,
this work melds concepts from multiple disciplines, lessons from real-world
projects and a critical synthesis of the literature to advance a novel,
end-to-end viewpoint on transparency, trustworthiness and responsible AI
deployment.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: LEAD提出了一种基于共享潜在空间的抗体序列-结构协同设计框架，优化了传统方法在原始数据空间中的低效搜索问题，并通过黑盒指导策略适应非可微分评估器。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在优化抗体互补决定区（CDRs）时效率低下，且无法同步处理序列和结构设计。

Method: LEAD在共享潜在空间中优化序列和结构，采用黑盒指导策略处理非可微分评估器。

Result: LEAD在单目标和多目标优化中表现优异，查询消耗减少一半，性能超越基线方法。

Conclusion: LEAD为抗体设计提供了一种高效且同步的优化框架，适用于实际场景中的非可微分评估器。

Abstract: Advancements in deep generative models have enabled the joint modeling of
antibody sequence and structure, given the antigen-antibody complex as context.
However, existing approaches for optimizing complementarity-determining regions
(CDRs) to improve developability properties operate in the raw data space,
leading to excessively costly evaluations due to the inefficient search
process. To address this, we propose LatEnt blAck-box Design (LEAD), a
sequence-structure co-design framework that optimizes both sequence and
structure within their shared latent space. Optimizing shared latent codes can
not only break through the limitations of existing methods, but also ensure
synchronization of different modality designs. Particularly, we design a
black-box guidance strategy to accommodate real-world scenarios where many
property evaluators are non-differentiable. Experimental results demonstrate
that our LEAD achieves superior optimization performance for both single and
multi-property objectives. Notably, LEAD reduces query consumption by a half
while surpassing baseline methods in property optimization. The code is
available at https://github.com/EvaFlower/LatEnt-blAck-box-Design.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种通过收缩理论提升卷积神经常微分方程（NODEs）鲁棒性的方法，通过正则化训练和权重调整减少输入噪声和对抗攻击的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 神经网络的脆弱性使其容易受到输入噪声和对抗攻击的影响，因此需要提升其鲁棒性。

Method: 利用收缩理论，通过正则化项（涉及系统动态的雅可比矩阵）或权重正则化项（针对特定激活函数的NODEs）诱导收缩性。

Result: 在MNIST和FashionMNIST数据集上验证了方法的有效性，能够应对多种噪声和攻击。

Conclusion: 提出的正则化方法显著提升了NODEs的鲁棒性，适用于图像分类任务。

Abstract: Neural networks can be fragile to input noise and adversarial attacks.
  In this work, we consider Convolutional Neural Ordinary Differential
Equations (NODEs), a family of continuous-depth neural networks represented by
dynamical systems, and propose to use contraction theory to improve their
robustness.
  For a contractive dynamical system two trajectories starting from different
initial conditions converge to each other exponentially fast.
  Contractive Convolutional NODEs can enjoy increased robustness as slight
perturbations of the features do not cause a significant change in the output.
  Contractivity can be induced during training by using a regularization term
involving the Jacobian of the system dynamics.
  To reduce the computational burden, we show that it can also be promoted
using carefully selected weight regularization terms for a class of NODEs with
slope-restricted activation functions.
  The performance of the proposed regularizers is illustrated through benchmark
image classification tasks on MNIST and FashionMNIST datasets, where images are
corrupted by different kinds of noise and attacks.

TL;DR: 论文提出了一种名为mCOCO的新框架，用于生成连接性脑模板（CBT），解决了现有方法在可解释性、计算成本和认知能力建模方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法（如传统机器学习和图神经网络）在生成CBT时存在可解释性差、计算成本高且忽略认知能力的问题。

Method: mCOCO利用储层计算（RC）从BOLD信号中学习群体水平的功能性CBT，并通过多感官输入（如文本、音频和视觉数据）增强认知能力。

Result: 实验表明，mCOCO在中心性、区分性、拓扑合理性和多感官记忆保留方面显著优于基于GNN的CBT。

Conclusion: mCOCO为功能性连接研究提供了一种高效且具有认知能力的新方法。

Abstract: The generation of connectional brain templates (CBTs) has recently garnered
significant attention for its potential to identify unique connectivity
patterns shared across individuals. However, existing methods for CBT learning
such as conventional machine learning and graph neural networks (GNNs) are
hindered by several limitations. These include: (i) poor interpretability due
to their black-box nature, (ii) high computational cost, and (iii) an exclusive
focus on structure and topology, overlooking the cognitive capacity of the
generated CBT. To address these challenges, we introduce mCOCO (multi-sensory
COgnitive COmputing), a novel framework that leverages Reservoir Computing (RC)
to learn population-level functional CBT from BOLD
(Blood-Oxygen-level-Dependent) signals. RC's dynamic system properties allow
for tracking state changes over time, enhancing interpretability and enabling
the modeling of brain-like dynamics, as demonstrated in prior literature. By
integrating multi-sensory inputs (e.g., text, audio, and visual data), mCOCO
captures not only structure and topology but also how brain regions process
information and adapt to cognitive tasks such as sensory processing, all in a
computationally efficient manner. Our mCOCO framework consists of two phases:
(1) mapping BOLD signals into the reservoir to derive individual functional
connectomes, which are then aggregated into a group-level CBT - an approach, to
the best of our knowledge, not previously explored in functional connectivity
studies - and (2) incorporating multi-sensory inputs through a cognitive
reservoir, endowing the CBT with cognitive traits. Extensive evaluations show
that our mCOCO-based template significantly outperforms GNN-based CBT in terms
of centeredness, discriminativeness, topological soundness, and multi-sensory
memory retention. Our source code is available at
https://github.com/basiralab/mCOCO.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着数据模型复杂度的增加（如深度学习），不确定性量化变得困难，需要验证现有算法的表现。

Method: 采用近似贝叶斯推断框架，在合成分类数据集上测试六种算法，评估其不确定性估计的校准性和分布外数据表现。

Result: 所有算法均表现良好校准，但深度学习算法在分布外数据上的不确定性估计不一致。

Conclusion: 研究为开发新的不确定性估计方法提供了参考，强调了深度学习算法在分布外数据上的局限性。

Abstract: Rigorous statistical methods, including parameter estimation with
accompanying uncertainties, underpin the validity of scientific discovery,
especially in the natural sciences. With increasingly complex data models such
as deep learning techniques, uncertainty quantification has become exceedingly
difficult and a plethora of techniques have been proposed. In this case study,
we use the unifying framework of approximate Bayesian inference combined with
empirical tests on carefully created synthetic classification datasets to
investigate qualitative properties of six different probabilistic machine
learning algorithms for class probability and uncertainty estimation: (i) a
neural network ensemble, (ii) neural network ensemble with conflictual loss,
(iii) evidential deep learning, (iv) a single neural network with Monte Carlo
Dropout, (v) Gaussian process classification and (vi) a Dirichlet process
mixture model. We check if the algorithms produce uncertainty estimates which
reflect commonly desired properties, such as being well calibrated and
exhibiting an increase in uncertainty for out-of-distribution data points. Our
results indicate that all algorithms are well calibrated, but none of the deep
learning based algorithms provide uncertainties that consistently reflect lack
of experimental evidence for out-of-distribution data points. We hope our study
may serve as a clarifying example for researchers developing new methods of
uncertainty estimation for scientific data-driven modeling.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种双空间引导的测试框架，通过协调场景参数空间和智能体行为空间，平衡多样性和关键性，优化关键场景生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 动态环境中决策智能体的部署增加，需要更有效的安全验证方法，现有方法在平衡多样性和关键性方面存在挑战。

Method: 采用分层表示框架结合降维和多维子空间评估，动态协调局部扰动和全局探索两种生成模式，并利用智能体行为数据形成反馈闭环。

Result: 实验表明，该框架在五种决策智能体上平均提高关键场景生成56.23%，并在新指标下表现更优。

Conclusion: 双空间引导框架显著提升了测试场景的多样性和关键性，优于现有方法。

Abstract: The growing deployment of decision-making agents in dynamic environments
increases the demand for safety verification. While critical testing scenario
generation has emerged as an appealing verification methodology, effectively
balancing diversity and criticality remains a key challenge for existing
methods, particularly due to local optima entrapment in high-dimensional
scenario spaces. To address this limitation, we propose a dual-space guided
testing framework that coordinates scenario parameter space and agent behavior
space, aiming to generate testing scenarios considering diversity and
criticality. Specifically, in the scenario parameter space, a hierarchical
representation framework combines dimensionality reduction and
multi-dimensional subspace evaluation to efficiently localize diverse and
critical subspaces. This guides dynamic coordination between two generation
modes: local perturbation and global exploration, optimizing critical scenario
quantity and diversity. Complementarily, in the agent behavior space,
agent-environment interaction data are leveraged to quantify behavioral
criticality/diversity and adaptively support generation mode switching, forming
a closed feedback loop that continuously enhances scenario characterization and
exploration within the parameter space. Experiments show our framework improves
critical scenario generation by an average of 56.23\% and demonstrates greater
diversity under novel parameter-behavior co-driven metrics when tested on five
decision-making agents, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines.

<details>

Motivation: 研究有限宽度效应对NTK统计量的影响，以弥补无限宽度极限下缺失的训练动态特性（如NTK演化和特征学习）。

Method: 引入费曼图计算有限宽度修正，推导层间递归关系，分析预激活、NTK及其高阶导数张量的统计量。

Result: 证明了ReLU等尺度不变非线性在NTK Gram矩阵对角线上无有限宽度修正，并通过数值实验验证了结果。

Conclusion: 费曼图方法为有限宽度NTK统计量提供了高效计算工具，扩展了深度网络稳定性分析的范围。

Abstract: Neural tangent kernels (NTKs) are a powerful tool for analyzing deep,
non-linear neural networks. In the infinite-width limit, NTKs can easily be
computed for most common architectures, yielding full analytic control over the
training dynamics. However, at infinite width, important properties of training
such as NTK evolution or feature learning are absent. Nevertheless, finite
width effects can be included by computing corrections to the Gaussian
statistics at infinite width. We introduce Feynman diagrams for computing
finite-width corrections to NTK statistics. These dramatically simplify the
necessary algebraic manipulations and enable the computation of layer-wise
recursive relations for arbitrary statistics involving preactivations, NTKs and
certain higher-derivative tensors (dNTK and ddNTK) required to predict the
training dynamics at leading order. We demonstrate the feasibility of our
framework by extending stability results for deep networks from preactivations
to NTKs and proving the absence of finite-width corrections for scale-invariant
nonlinearities such as ReLU on the diagonal of the Gram matrix of the NTK. We
validate our results with numerical experiments.

Conclusion: 物理信息扩散模型在异常检测中表现优异，尤其在合成数据集和部分真实数据集中超越现有方法。

Abstract: We propose an unsupervised anomaly detection approach based on a
physics-informed diffusion model for multivariate time series data. Over the
past years, diffusion model has demonstrated its effectiveness in forecasting,
imputation, generation, and anomaly detection in the time series domain. In
this paper, we present a new approach for learning the physics-dependent
temporal distribution of multivariate time series data using a weighted
physics-informed loss during diffusion model training. A weighted
physics-informed loss is constructed using a static weight schedule. This
approach enables a diffusion model to accurately approximate underlying data
distribution, which can influence the unsupervised anomaly detection
performance. Our experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show that
physics-informed training improves the F1 score in anomaly detection; it
generates better data diversity and log-likelihood. Our model outperforms
baseline approaches, additionally, it surpasses prior physics-informed work and
purely data-driven diffusion models on a synthetic dataset and one real-world
dataset while remaining competitive on others.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有去中心化联邦学习（DFL）方法未能有效处理局部子图的拓扑信息，而联邦图学习（FGL）又依赖中心化架构。

Method: 提出DFed-SST框架，采用双拓扑自适应通信机制，动态优化客户端间的通信拓扑。

Result: 在八个真实数据集上，DFed-SST平均准确率提升3.26%。

Conclusion: DFed-SST通过自适应通信机制显著提升了去中心化联邦图学习的性能。

Abstract: Decentralized Federated Learning (DFL) has emerged as a robust distributed
paradigm that circumvents the single-point-of-failure and communication
bottleneck risks of centralized architectures. However, a significant challenge
arises as existing DFL optimization strategies, primarily designed for tasks
such as computer vision, fail to address the unique topological information
inherent in the local subgraph. Notably, while Federated Graph Learning (FGL)
is tailored for graph data, it is predominantly implemented in a centralized
server-client model, failing to leverage the benefits of decentralization.To
bridge this gap, we propose DFed-SST, a decentralized federated graph learning
framework with adaptive communication. The core of our method is a
dual-topology adaptive communication mechanism that leverages the unique
topological features of each client's local subgraph to dynamically construct
and optimize the inter-client communication topology. This allows our framework
to guide model aggregation efficiently in the face of heterogeneity. Extensive
experiments on eight real-world datasets consistently demonstrate the
superiority of DFed-SST, achieving 3.26% improvement in average accuracy over
baseline methods.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决工业规模RL中训练与代理执行的耦合问题，以及资源利用率低的问题。

Method: 引入数据平面解耦RL训练与代理实现，采用标签驱动调度范式动态分配资源。

Result: 实现了稳定性和高性能，适用于多代理、长周期等复杂RL任务。

Conclusion: SeamlessFlow通过创新设计，为大规模RL部署提供了高效稳定的解决方案。

Abstract: We introduce SeamlessFlow, a server based reinforcement learning (RL)
framework that addresses two core challenges in industrial scale RL: (1)
decoupling RL training from the complex execution flow of agents; (2)
maximizing GPU utilization with minimal idle time while preserving the
stability and scalability required for large-scale deployments. First,
SeamlessFlow introduces a data plane that decouples the RL trainer from
diverse, complex agent implementations while sustaining high throughput. A
central trajectory manager maintains complete interaction histories and
supports partial rollout, allowing rollout to pause for weight updates and
resume seamlessly, keeping agents unaware of service interruptions. Second, we
propose a tag driven scheduling paradigm that abstracts hardware into
capability tagged resources, unifying colocated and disaggregated
architectures. Based on this, SeamlessFlow introduces a spatiotemporal
multiplexing pipeline that dynamically reassigns idle training nodes to rollout
in a train rollout separated setup, eliminating pipeline bubbles and fully
exploiting heterogeneous cluster resources. By combining these innovations,
SeamlessFlow delivers both stability and high performance, making it well
suited for multi agent, long horizon, and other complex RL tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: CCS项目涉及多方利益相关者，各自目标不同且地质条件复杂，需探讨独立优化或协作联盟的可行性。

Method: 采用多智能体强化学习方法，结合安全约束，利用E2C框架的替代模型降低计算成本。

Result: 结果表明，该框架能有效管理多利益相关者参与的CO2封存问题。

Conclusion: 协作联盟结构对CCS项目的优化管理至关重要。

Abstract: Carbon capture and storage (CCS) projects typically involve a diverse array
of stakeholders or players from public, private, and regulatory sectors, each
with different objectives and responsibilities. Given the complexity, scale,
and long-term nature of CCS operations, determining whether individual
stakeholders can independently maximize their interests or whether
collaborative coalition agreements are needed remains a central question for
effective CCS project planning and management. CCS projects are often
implemented in geologically connected sites, where shared geological features
such as pressure space and reservoir pore capacity can lead to competitive
behavior among stakeholders. Furthermore, CO2 storage sites are often located
in geologically mature basins that previously served as sites for hydrocarbon
extraction or wastewater disposal in order to leverage existing
infrastructures, which makes unilateral optimization even more complicated and
unrealistic.
  In this work, we propose a paradigm based on Markov games to quantitatively
investigate how different coalition structures affect the goals of
stakeholders. We frame this multi-stakeholder multi-site problem as a
multi-agent reinforcement learning problem with safety constraints. Our
approach enables agents to learn optimal strategies while compliant with safety
regulations. We present an example where multiple operators are injecting CO2
into their respective project areas in a geologically connected basin. To
address the high computational cost of repeated simulations of high-fidelity
models, a previously developed surrogate model based on the Embed-to-Control
(E2C) framework is employed. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of the
proposed framework in addressing optimal management of CO2 storage when
multiple stakeholders with various objectives and goals are involved.

Motivation: 传统论文搜索系统仅基于摘要构建索引，无法满足灵活粒度的搜索需求。

Method: 提出PaperRegister系统，包含离线分层索引和在线自适应检索，将传统摘要索引转化为分层索引树。

Result: 实验表明，PaperRegister在多种粒度搜索任务中表现最优，尤其在细粒度场景下效果显著。

Conclusion: PaperRegister是解决灵活粒度论文搜索问题的有效方案，具有实际应用潜力。

Abstract: Paper search is an important activity for researchers, typically involving
using a query with description of a topic to find relevant papers. As research
deepens, paper search requirements may become more flexible, sometimes
involving specific details such as module configuration rather than being
limited to coarse-grained topics. However, previous paper search systems are
unable to meet these flexible-grained requirements, as these systems mainly
collect paper abstracts to construct index of corpus, which lack detailed
information to support retrieval by finer-grained queries. In this work, we
propose PaperRegister, consisted of offline hierarchical indexing and online
adaptive retrieval, transforming traditional abstract-based index into
hierarchical index tree for paper search, thereby supporting queries at
flexible granularity. Experiments on paper search tasks across a range of
granularity demonstrate that PaperRegister achieves the state-of-the-art
performance, and particularly excels in fine-grained scenarios, highlighting
the good potential as an effective solution for flexible-grained paper search
in real-world applications. Code for this work is in

Abstract: Identification of appropriate supporting evidence is critical to the success
of scientific fact checking. However, existing approaches rely on off-the-shelf
Information Retrieval algorithms that rank documents based on relevance rather
than the evidence they provide to support or refute the claim being checked.
This paper proposes +VeriRel which includes verification success in the
document ranking. Experimental results on three scientific fact checking
datasets (SciFact, SciFact-Open and Check-Covid) demonstrate consistently
leading performance by +VeriRel for document evidence retrieval and a positive
impact on downstream verification. This study highlights the potential of
integrating verification feedback to document relevance assessment for
effective scientific fact checking systems. It shows promising future work to
evaluate fine-grained relevance when examining complex documents for advanced
scientific fact checking.

Abstract: Generative Search Engines (GSEs), powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) and
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), are reshaping information retrieval.
While commercial systems (e.g., BingChat, Perplexity.ai) demonstrate impressive
semantic synthesis capabilities, their black-box nature fundamentally
undermines established Search Engine Optimization (SEO) practices. Content
creators face a critical challenge: their optimization strategies, effective in
traditional search engines, are misaligned with generative retrieval contexts,
resulting in diminished visibility. To bridge this gap, we propose a
Role-Augmented Intent-Driven Generative Search Engine Optimization (G-SEO)
method, providing a structured optimization pathway tailored for GSE scenarios.
Our method models search intent through reflective refinement across diverse
informational roles, enabling targeted content enhancement. To better evaluate
the method under realistic settings, we address the benchmarking limitations of
prior work by: (1) extending the GEO dataset with diversified query variations
reflecting real-world search scenarios and (2) introducing G-Eval 2.0, a
6-level LLM-augmented evaluation rubric for fine-grained human-aligned
assessment. Experimental results demonstrate that search intent serves as an
effective signal for guiding content optimization, yielding significant
improvements over single-aspect baseline approaches in both subjective
impressions and objective content visibility within GSE responses.

Conclusion: DQRec通过提取行为特征和增强链接，显著提升了推荐系统的性能。

Abstract: As the core algorithm in recommendation systems, collaborative filtering (CF)
algorithms inevitably face the problem of data sparsity. Since CF captures
similar users and items for recommendations, it is effective to augment the
lacking user-user and item-item homogeneous linkages. However, existing methods
are typically limited to connecting through overlapping interacted neighbors or
through similar attributes and contents. These approaches are constrained by
coarse-grained, sparse attributes and fail to effectively extract behavioral
characteristics jointly from interaction sequences and attributes. To address
these challenges, we propose a novel two-stage collaborative recommendation
algorithm, DQRec: Decomposition-based Quantized Variational AutoEncoder
(DQ-VAE) for Recommendation. DQRec augments features and homogeneous linkages
by extracting the behavior characteristics jointly from interaction sequences
and attributes, namely patterns, such as user multi-aspect interests. Inspired
by vector quantization (VQ) technology, we propose a new VQ algorithm, DQ-VAE,
which decomposes the pre-trained representation embeddings into distinct
dimensions, and quantize them to generates semantic IDs. We utilize the
generated semantic IDs as the extracted patterns mentioned above. By
integrating these semantic ID patterns into the recommendation process through
feature and linkage augmentation, the system enriches both latent and explicit
user and item features, identifies pattern-similar neighbors, and thereby
improves the efficiency of information diffusion. Experimental comparisons with
baselines across multiple datasets demonstrate the superior performance of the
proposed DQRec method.

Abstract: In recent years, recommender systems have primarily focused on improving
accuracy at the expense of diversity, which exacerbates the well-known filter
bubble effect. This paper proposes a universal framework called CD-CGCN to
address the filter bubble issue in recommender systems from a community
detection perspective. By analyzing user-item interaction histories with a
community detection algorithm, we reveal that state-of-the-art recommendations
often focus on intra-community items, worsening the filter bubble effect.
CD-CGCN, a model-agnostic framework, integrates a Conditional Discriminator and
a Community-reweighted Graph Convolutional Network which can be plugged into
most recommender models. Using adversarial learning based on community labels,
it counteracts the extracted community attributes and incorporates an inference
strategy tailored to the user's specific filter bubble state. Extensive
experiments on real-world datasets with multiple base models validate its
effectiveness in mitigating filter bubbles while preserving recommendation
quality. Additionally, by applying community debiasing to the original test set
to construct an unbiased test set, we observe that CD-CGCN demonstrates
superior performance in capturing users' inter-community preferences.

Conclusion: INFNet通过任务感知设计和高效特征交互机制，成功解决了大规模推荐系统中的关键挑战。

Abstract: Feature interaction has long been a cornerstone of ranking models in
large-scale recommender systems due to its proven effectiveness in capturing
complex dependencies among features. However, existing feature interaction
strategies face two critical challenges in industrial applications: (1) The
vast number of categorical and sequential features makes exhaustive interaction
computationally prohibitive, often resulting in optimization difficulties. (2)
Real-world recommender systems typically involve multiple prediction
objectives, yet most current approaches apply feature interaction modules prior
to the multi-task learning layers. This late-fusion design overlooks
task-specific feature dependencies and inherently limits the capacity of
multi-task modeling. To address these limitations, we propose the Information
Flow Network (INFNet), a task-aware architecture designed for large-scale
recommendation scenarios. INFNet distinguishes features into three token types,
categorical tokens, sequence tokens, and task tokens, and introduces a novel
dual-flow design comprising heterogeneous and homogeneous alternating
information blocks. For heterogeneous information flow, we employ a
cross-attention mechanism with proxy that facilitates efficient cross-modal
token interaction with balanced computational cost. For homogeneous flow, we
design type-specific Proxy Gated Units (PGUs) to enable fine-grained intra-type
feature processing. Extensive experiments on multiple offline benchmarks
confirm that INFNet achieves state-of-the-art performance. Moreover, INFNet has
been successfully deployed in a commercial online advertising system, yielding
significant gains of +1.587% in Revenue (REV) and +1.155% in Click-Through Rate
(CTR).
