*Jiani Huang,Amish Sethi,Matthew Kuo,Mayank Keoliya,Neelay Velingker,JungHo Jung,Ser-Nam Lim,Ziyang Li,Mayur Naik*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了ESCA框架和SGClip模型，通过结构化时空理解来情境化具身智能体，无需人工标注的场景图数据，在具身环境中实现最先进性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型主要依赖高层视觉-声音-文本对，缺乏像素级视觉内容与文本语义的细粒度结构化对齐

Method: 开发SGClip模型，基于CLIP的开放域可提示场景图生成模型，通过神经符号学习管道在87K+开放域视频上训练，利用模型驱动的自监督和结构化推理

Result: SGClip在场景图生成和动作定位基准测试中表现出色，ESCA框架持续改进开源和商业MLLMs，在两个具身环境中达到最先进性能，显著减少感知错误

Conclusion: ESCA框架通过结构化空间-时间理解有效情境化具身智能体，使开源模型超越专有基线，为通用具身智能体发展提供了新途径

Abstract: Multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) are making rapid progress toward
general-purpose embodied agents. However, current training pipelines primarily
rely on high-level vision-sound-text pairs and lack fine-grained, structured
alignment between pixel-level visual content and textual semantics. To overcome
this challenge, we propose ESCA, a new framework for contextualizing embodied
agents through structured spatial-temporal understanding. At its core is
SGClip, a novel CLIP-based, open-domain, and promptable model for generating
scene graphs. SGClip is trained on 87K+ open-domain videos via a neurosymbolic
learning pipeline, which harnesses model-driven self-supervision from
video-caption pairs and structured reasoning, thereby eliminating the need for
human-labeled scene graph annotations. We demonstrate that SGClip supports both
prompt-based inference and task-specific fine-tuning, excelling in scene graph
generation and action localization benchmarks. ESCA with SGClip consistently
improves both open-source and commercial MLLMs, achieving state-of-the-art
performance across two embodied environments. Notably, it significantly reduces
agent perception errors and enables open-source models to surpass proprietary
baselines.

### [2] [CrossRay3D: Geometry and Distribution Guidance for Efficient Multimodal 3D Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15991)
*Huiming Yang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出CrossRay3D稀疏多模态检测器，通过Ray-Aware监督和Class-Balanced监督提升token表示质量，在nuScenes基准上达到SOTA性能72.4 mAP和74.7 NDS，且运行速度更快。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有稀疏检测器忽视了token表示质量，导致前景质量次优和性能受限。几何结构保持和类别分布是提升稀疏检测器性能的关键。

Method: 提出Sparse Selector(SS)，核心模块包括：Ray-Aware Supervision(RAS)保持训练阶段的几何信息，Class-Balanced Supervision自适应重加权类别语义显著性，以及Ray Positional Encoding解决LiDAR和图像模态间的分布差异。

Result: 在nuScenes基准上达到72.4 mAP和74.7 NDS的SOTA性能，运行速度比其他领先方法快1.84倍，且在LiDAR或相机数据部分或完全缺失的场景下表现出强鲁棒性。

Conclusion: CrossRay3D通过改进token表示质量，在保持稀疏检测器优势的同时显著提升了性能，证明了几何结构保持和类别平衡监督的重要性。

Abstract: The sparse cross-modality detector offers more advantages than its
counterpart, the Bird's-Eye-View (BEV) detector, particularly in terms of
adaptability for downstream tasks and computational cost savings. However,
existing sparse detectors overlook the quality of token representation, leaving
it with a sub-optimal foreground quality and limited performance. In this
paper, we identify that the geometric structure preserved and the class
distribution are the key to improving the performance of the sparse detector,
and propose a Sparse Selector (SS). The core module of SS is Ray-Aware
Supervision (RAS), which preserves rich geometric information during the
training stage, and Class-Balanced Supervision, which adaptively reweights the
salience of class semantics, ensuring that tokens associated with small objects
are retained during token sampling. Thereby, outperforming other sparse
multi-modal detectors in the representation of tokens. Additionally, we design
Ray Positional Encoding (Ray PE) to address the distribution differences
between the LiDAR modality and the image. Finally, we integrate the
aforementioned module into an end-to-end sparse multi-modality detector, dubbed
CrossRay3D. Experiments show that, on the challenging nuScenes benchmark,
CrossRay3D achieves state-of-the-art performance with 72.4 mAP and 74.7 NDS,
while running 1.84 faster than other leading methods. Moreover, CrossRay3D
demonstrates strong robustness even in scenarios where LiDAR or camera data are
partially or entirely missing.

### [3] [InfraGPT Smart Infrastructure: An End-to-End VLM-Based Framework for Detecting and Managing Urban Defects](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16017)
*Ibrahim Sheikh Mohamed,Abdullah Yahya Abdullah Omaisan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一个基于CCTV监控的智能城市基础设施缺陷检测系统，使用YOLO进行多缺陷检测和分割，并通过视觉语言模型生成结构化的维修行动计划。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 智能城市基础设施监控需求增长，手动检查成本高且危险，现有自动系统通常只能处理单一缺陷类型或输出非结构化结果，无法直接指导维修工作。

Method: 利用街道CCTV流进行多缺陷检测和分割，使用YOLO系列目标检测器，然后将检测结果传递给视觉语言模型进行场景感知总结，生成包含事件描述、推荐工具、尺寸、维修计划和紧急警报的JSON格式结构化行动计划。

Result: 在公共数据集和捕获的CCTV片段上的实验评估表明，系统能准确识别多种缺陷并生成连贯的总结。

Conclusion: 讨论了将系统扩展到城市范围部署的挑战和方向。

Abstract: Infrastructure in smart cities is increasingly monitored by networks of
closed circuit television (CCTV) cameras. Roads, bridges and tunnels develop
cracks, potholes, and fluid leaks that threaten public safety and require
timely repair. Manual inspection is costly and hazardous, and existing
automatic systems typically address individual defect types or provide
unstructured outputs that cannot directly guide maintenance crews. This paper
proposes a comprehensive pipeline that leverages street CCTV streams for multi
defect detection and segmentation using the YOLO family of object detectors and
passes the detections to a vision language model (VLM) for scene aware
summarization. The VLM generates a structured action plan in JSON format that
includes incident descriptions, recommended tools, dimensions, repair plans,
and urgent alerts. We review literature on pothole, crack and leak detection,
highlight recent advances in large vision language models such as QwenVL and
LLaVA, and describe the design of our early prototype. Experimental evaluation
on public datasets and captured CCTV clips demonstrates that the system
accurately identifies diverse defects and produces coherent summaries. We
conclude by discussing challenges and directions for scaling the system to city
wide deployments.

### [4] [IAD-GPT: Advancing Visual Knowledge in Multimodal Large Language Model for Industrial Anomaly Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16036)
*Zewen Li,Zitong Yu,Qilang Ye,Weicheng Xie,Wei Zhuo,Linlin Shen*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: IAD-GPT是一个基于多模态大语言模型的工业异常检测新范式，通过异常提示生成器、文本引导增强器和多掩码融合模块，结合文本语义与图像信息，在自监督和少样本异常检测任务中达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统工业异常检测方法缺乏多轮人机对话和详细描述能力，而基于大预训练模型的方法尚未充分激发大模型在异常检测任务中的潜力。

Method: 使用异常提示生成器生成详细异常提示，通过文本引导增强器增强视觉定位能力，设计多掩码融合模块将掩码作为专家知识增强像素级异常感知。

Result: 在MVTec-AD和VisA数据集上的大量实验表明，该方法在自监督和少样本异常检测与分割任务中达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: IAD-GPT成功将多模态大语言模型应用于工业异常检测，通过结合文本语义与图像信息实现了优异的检测性能。

Abstract: The robust causal capability of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) hold
the potential of detecting defective objects in Industrial Anomaly Detection
(IAD). However, most traditional IAD methods lack the ability to provide
multi-turn human-machine dialogues and detailed descriptions, such as the color
of objects, the shape of an anomaly, or specific types of anomalies. At the
same time, methods based on large pre-trained models have not fully stimulated
the ability of large models in anomaly detection tasks. In this paper, we
explore the combination of rich text semantics with both image-level and
pixel-level information from images and propose IAD-GPT, a novel paradigm based
on MLLMs for IAD. We employ Abnormal Prompt Generator (APG) to generate
detailed anomaly prompts for specific objects. These specific prompts from the
large language model (LLM) are used to activate the detection and segmentation
functions of the pre-trained visual-language model (i.e., CLIP). To enhance the
visual grounding ability of MLLMs, we propose Text-Guided Enhancer, wherein
image features interact with normal and abnormal text prompts to dynamically
select enhancement pathways, which enables language models to focus on specific
aspects of visual data, enhancing their ability to accurately interpret and
respond to anomalies within images. Moreover, we design a Multi-Mask Fusion
module to incorporate mask as expert knowledge, which enhances the LLM's
perception of pixel-level anomalies. Extensive experiments on MVTec-AD and VisA
datasets demonstrate our state-of-the-art performance on self-supervised and
few-shot anomaly detection and segmentation tasks, such as MVTec-AD and VisA
datasets. The codes are available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究比较了三种胸部X光片报告模式：自由文本、结构化报告和AI辅助结构化报告。AI-SR在诊断准确性和效率方面表现最佳，能显著减少报告时间并改善用户体验。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 评估结构化报告和人工智能如何改变放射科医生与影像研究的交互方式，比较不同报告模式对图像分析行为、诊断准确性、效率和用户体验的影响。

Method: 前瞻性研究，8名参与者（4名新手和4名非新手）使用定制查看器和眼动追踪系统分析35张床边胸部X光片，比较三种报告模式：自由文本、结构化报告和AI辅助结构化报告。

Result: AI-SR诊断准确性最高（κ=0.71），报告时间最短（25±9秒），眼动指标显示视觉注意力更集中于图像区域，且是用户首选模式。

Conclusion: 结构化报告通过引导视觉注意力向图像来提高效率，而AI预填充的结构化报告进一步提升了诊断准确性和用户满意度。

Abstract: Structured reporting (SR) and artificial intelligence (AI) may transform how
radiologists interact with imaging studies. This prospective study (July to
December 2024) evaluated the impact of three reporting modes: free-text (FT),
structured reporting (SR), and AI-assisted structured reporting (AI-SR), on
image analysis behavior, diagnostic accuracy, efficiency, and user experience.
Four novice and four non-novice readers (radiologists and medical students)
each analyzed 35 bedside chest radiographs per session using a customized
viewer and an eye-tracking system. Outcomes included diagnostic accuracy
(compared with expert consensus using Cohen's $\kappa$), reporting time per
radiograph, eye-tracking metrics, and questionnaire-based user experience.
Statistical analysis used generalized linear mixed models with Bonferroni
post-hoc tests with a significance level of ($P \le .01$). Diagnostic accuracy
was similar in FT ($\kappa = 0.58$) and SR ($\kappa = 0.60$) but higher in
AI-SR ($\kappa = 0.71$, $P < .001$). Reporting times decreased from $88 \pm 38$
s (FT) to $37 \pm 18$ s (SR) and $25 \pm 9$ s (AI-SR) ($P < .001$). Saccade
counts for the radiograph field ($205 \pm 135$ (FT), $123 \pm 88$ (SR), $97 \pm
58$ (AI-SR)) and total fixation duration for the report field ($11 \pm 5$ s
(FT), $5 \pm 3$ s (SR), $4 \pm 1$ s (AI-SR)) were lower with SR and AI-SR ($P <
.001$ each). Novice readers shifted gaze towards the radiograph in SR, while
non-novice readers maintained their focus on the radiograph. AI-SR was the
preferred mode. In conclusion, SR improves efficiency by guiding visual
attention toward the image, and AI-prefilled SR further enhances diagnostic
accuracy and user satisfaction.

### [6] [Data-Driven Analysis of Intersectional Bias in Image Classification: A Framework with Bias-Weighted Augmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16072)
*Farjana Yesmin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出一种数据驱动框架IFEF来分析和缓解图像分类中的交叉偏见，并引入Bias-Weighted Augmentation方法，在Open Images V7数据集上显著提升弱势群体的准确率并减少公平性差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器学习模型在非平衡数据集上训练时经常表现出交叉偏见——由多个属性（如对象类别和环境条件）相互作用产生的系统性错误。

Method: 提出交叉公平性评估框架(IFEF)，结合定量公平性指标和可解释性工具来系统识别模型预测中的偏见模式；在此基础上提出Bias-Weighted Augmentation(BWA)数据增强策略，基于子组分布统计自适应调整变换强度。

Result: 在Open Images V7数据集上，BWA将弱势类-环境交叉组的准确率提升高达24个百分点，同时将公平性指标差距减少35%。多次独立运行的统计分析证实了改进的显著性(p < 0.05)。

Conclusion: 该方法为分析和解决图像分类系统中的交叉偏见提供了可复现的途径。

Abstract: Machine learning models trained on imbalanced datasets often exhibit
intersectional biases-systematic errors arising from the interaction of
multiple attributes such as object class and environmental conditions. This
paper presents a data-driven framework for analyzing and mitigating such biases
in image classification. We introduce the Intersectional Fairness Evaluation
Framework (IFEF), which combines quantitative fairness metrics with
interpretability tools to systematically identify bias patterns in model
predictions. Building on this analysis, we propose Bias-Weighted Augmentation
(BWA), a novel data augmentation strategy that adapts transformation
intensities based on subgroup distribution statistics. Experiments on the Open
Images V7 dataset with five object classes demonstrate that BWA improves
accuracy for underrepresented class-environment intersections by up to 24
percentage points while reducing fairness metric disparities by 35%.
Statistical analysis across multiple independent runs confirms the significance
of improvements (p < 0.05). Our methodology provides a replicable approach for
analyzing and addressing intersectional biases in image classification systems.

### [7] [Differentiable, Bit-shifting, and Scalable Quantization without training neural network from scratch](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16088)
*Zia Badar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种可微分的神经网络量化方法，支持多比特对数量化，在ImageNet数据集上使用ResNet18进行权重量化时，仅需15个训练周期就能达到与全精度模型相差不到1%的准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有量化方法存在两个主要问题：一是大多使用不可微分方法，在反向传播中需要手动设置导数，影响学习能力；二是之前的移位/对数量化方法要么避免激活量化，要么准确率较低。

Method: 开发了可微分的量化方法，支持n比特量化，特别是对数形式的2^n量化。提供了收敛性证明，确保方法能收敛到最优神经网络。

Result: 在ImageNet图像分类任务中，仅权重量化时准确率与全精度模型相差不到1%；权重和激活同时量化时，准确率与最先进方法相当。训练仅需15个周期，推理成本略高于1比特量化但无需高精度乘法。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了可证明收敛的可微分量化方案，支持多比特对数量化，在保持高准确率的同时显著减少了训练和推理成本。

Abstract: Quantization of neural networks provides benefits of inference in less
compute and memory requirements. Previous work in quantization lack two
important aspects which this work provides. First almost all previous work in
quantization used a non-differentiable approach and for learning; the
derivative is usually set manually in backpropogation which make the learning
ability of algorithm questionable, our approach is not just differentiable, we
also provide proof of convergence of our approach to the optimal neural
network. Second previous work in shift/logrithmic quantization either have
avoided activation quantization along with weight quantization or achieved less
accuracy. Learning logrithmic quantize values of form $2^n$ requires the
quantization function can scale to more than 1 bit quantization which is
another benifit of our quantization that it provides $n$ bits quantization as
well. Our approach when tested with image classification task using imagenet
dataset, resnet18 and weight quantization only achieves less than 1 percent
accuracy compared to full precision accuracy while taking only 15 epochs to
train using shift bit quantization and achieves comparable to SOTA approaches
accuracy in both weight and activation quantization using shift bit
quantization in 15 training epochs with slightly higher(only higher cpu
instructions) inference cost compared to 1 bit quantization(without logrithmic
quantization) and not requiring any higher precision multiplication.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出StripRFNet网络用于道路表面损伤检测，通过三个模块解决形状多样、细长裂缝难以捕捉和小尺度损伤识别困难的问题，在RDD2022基准测试中达到最先进精度和实时效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 道路表面损伤威胁交通安全并阻碍可持续城市发展，但准确检测面临挑战：损伤形状多样、细长裂缝难以捕捉、小尺度损伤识别错误率高。

Method: StripRFNet包含三个模块：形状感知模块（SPM）通过大分离核注意力增强形状判别；条带感受野模块（SRFM）使用大条带卷积和池化捕捉细长裂缝特征；小尺度增强模块（SSEM）利用高分辨率P2特征图、专用检测头和动态上采样改进小目标检测。

Result: 在RDD2022基准测试中，StripRFNet超越现有方法。在中国子集上，F1分数、mAP50和mAP50:95分别比基线提高4.4、2.9和3.4个百分点；在全数据集上达到80.33%的最高F1分数，同时保持有竞争力的推理速度。

Conclusion: StripRFNet实现了最先进的精度和实时效率，为智能道路维护和可持续基础设施管理提供了有前景的工具。

Abstract: Well-maintained road networks are crucial for achieving Sustainable
Development Goal (SDG) 11. Road surface damage not only threatens traffic
safety but also hinders sustainable urban development. Accurate detection,
however, remains challenging due to the diverse shapes of damages, the
difficulty of capturing slender cracks with high aspect ratios, and the high
error rates in small-scale damage recognition. To address these issues, we
propose StripRFNet, a novel deep neural network comprising three modules: (1) a
Shape Perception Module (SPM) that enhances shape discrimination via large
separable kernel attention (LSKA) in multi-scale feature aggregation; (2) a
Strip Receptive Field Module (SRFM) that employs large strip convolutions and
pooling to capture features of slender cracks; and (3) a Small-Scale
Enhancement Module (SSEM) that leverages a high-resolution P2 feature map, a
dedicated detection head, and dynamic upsampling to improve small-object
detection. Experiments on the RDD2022 benchmark show that StripRFNet surpasses
existing methods. On the Chinese subset, it improves F1-score, mAP50, and
mAP50:95 by 4.4, 2.9, and 3.4 percentage points over the baseline,
respectively. On the full dataset, it achieves the highest F1-score of 80.33%
compared with CRDDC'2022 participants and ORDDC'2024 Phase 2 results, while
maintaining competitive inference speed. These results demonstrate that
StripRFNet achieves state-of-the-art accuracy and real-time efficiency,
offering a promising tool for intelligent road maintenance and sustainable
infrastructure management.

### [9] [ObjectTransforms for Uncertainty Quantification and Reduction in Vision-Based Perception for Autonomous Vehicles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16118)
*Nishad Sahu,Shounak Sural,Aditya Satish Patil,Ragunathan,Rajkumar*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ObjectTransforms是一种通过对象特定变换来量化和减少视觉目标检测中不确定性的技术，在训练和推理时分别应用颜色空间扰动和扩散模型生成，提高检测精度和不确定性量化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动驾驶中可靠的感知对安全决策至关重要，但基于视觉的目标检测神经网络容易受到数据偏差和分布偏移等不确定性因素的影响。

Method: 在训练时对单个对象进行颜色空间扰动，并使用扩散模型生成多样化的行人实例；在推理时对检测到的对象应用扰动，利用检测分数的方差实时量化预测不确定性。

Result: 在NuImages 10K数据集上的YOLOv8实验表明，该方法在所有对象类别上都带来了显著的精度提升和不确定性减少，在推理时对假阳性预测了比真阳性更高的不确定性值。

Conclusion: ObjectTransforms作为一种轻量级但有效的机制，在训练和推理期间分别具有减少和量化视觉感知不确定性的潜力。

Abstract: Reliable perception is fundamental for safety critical decision making in
autonomous driving. Yet, vision based object detector neural networks remain
vulnerable to uncertainty arising from issues such as data bias and
distributional shifts. In this paper, we introduce ObjectTransforms, a
technique for quantifying and reducing uncertainty in vision based object
detection through object specific transformations at both training and
inference times. At training time, ObjectTransforms perform color space
perturbations on individual objects, improving robustness to lighting and color
variations. ObjectTransforms also uses diffusion models to generate realistic,
diverse pedestrian instances. At inference time, object perturbations are
applied to detected objects and the variance of detection scores are used to
quantify predictive uncertainty in real time. This uncertainty signal is then
used to filter out false positives and also recover false negatives, improving
the overall precision recall curve. Experiments with YOLOv8 on the NuImages 10K
dataset demonstrate that our method yields notable accuracy improvements and
uncertainty reduction across all object classes during training, while
predicting desirably higher uncertainty values for false positives as compared
to true positives during inference. Our results highlight the potential of
ObjectTransforms as a lightweight yet effective mechanism for reducing and
quantifying uncertainty in vision-based perception during training and
inference respectively.

*Sayan Deb Sarkar,Sinisa Stekovic,Vincent Lepetit,Iro Armeni*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种无需训练的方法，通过引导损失函数在采样过程中实现3D资产的外观迁移，解决了现有方法在几何差异较大时失效的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在输入和外观对象几何差异显著时效果不佳，直接应用3D生成模型无法产生令人满意的结果，需要更有效的外观迁移方法。

Method: 基于预训练的整流流模型，在采样过程中周期性地添加可微分损失函数作为引导，包括部分感知损失和自相似性损失。

Conclusion: 该方法具有通用性，可扩展到不同类型的扩散模型和引导函数，为3D外观迁移提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Transferring appearance to 3D assets using different representations of the
appearance object - such as images or text - has garnered interest due to its
wide range of applications in industries like gaming, augmented reality, and
digital content creation. However, state-of-the-art methods still fail when the
geometry between the input and appearance objects is significantly different. A
straightforward approach is to directly apply a 3D generative model, but we
show that this ultimately fails to produce appealing results. Instead, we
propose a principled approach inspired by universal guidance. Given a
pretrained rectified flow model conditioned on image or text, our training-free
method interacts with the sampling process by periodically adding guidance.
This guidance can be modeled as a differentiable loss function, and we
experiment with two different types of guidance including part-aware losses for
appearance and self-similarity. Our experiments show that our approach
successfully transfers texture and geometric details to the input 3D asset,
outperforming baselines both qualitatively and quantitatively. We also show
that traditional metrics are not suitable for evaluating the task due to their
inability of focusing on local details and comparing dissimilar inputs, in
absence of ground truth data. We thus evaluate appearance transfer quality with
a GPT-based system objectively ranking outputs, ensuring robust and human-like
assessment, as further confirmed by our user study. Beyond showcased scenarios,
our method is general and could be extended to different types of diffusion
models and guidance functions.

Abstract: Thrombectomy is one of the most effective treatments for ischemic stroke, but
it is resource and personnel-intensive. We propose employing deep learning to
automate critical aspects of thrombectomy, thereby enhancing efficiency and
safety. In this work, we introduce a self-supervised framework that classifies
various skeletal landmarks using a regression-based pretext task. Our
experiments demonstrate that our model outperforms existing methods in both
regression and classification tasks. Notably, our results indicate that the
positional pretext task significantly enhances downstream classification
performance. Future work will focus on extending this framework toward fully
autonomous C-arm control, aiming to optimize trajectories from the pelvis to
the head during stroke thrombectomy procedures. All code used is available at

Abstract: The limited availability of annotated data in medical imaging makes
semi-supervised learning increasingly appealing for its ability to learn from
imperfect supervision. Recently, teacher-student frameworks have gained
popularity for their training benefits and robust performance. However, jointly
optimizing the entire network can hinder convergence and stability, especially
in challenging scenarios. To address this for medical image segmentation, we
propose DuetMatch, a novel dual-branch semi-supervised framework with
asynchronous optimization, where each branch optimizes either the encoder or
decoder while keeping the other frozen. To improve consistency under noisy
conditions, we introduce Decoupled Dropout Perturbation, enforcing
regularization across branches. We also design Pair-wise CutMix Cross-Guidance
to enhance model diversity by exchanging pseudo-labels through augmented input
pairs. To mitigate confirmation bias from noisy pseudo-labels, we propose
Consistency Matching, refining labels using stable predictions from frozen
teacher models. Extensive experiments on benchmark brain MRI segmentation
datasets, including ISLES2022 and BraTS, show that DuetMatch consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating its effectiveness and
robustness across diverse semi-supervised segmentation scenarios.

Motivation: 临床工作流程依赖手动对齐C臂，这会增加辐射暴露和手术延迟，需要自动化解决方案来提高效率和安全性。

Method: 使用X射线图像预测3D位移向量，结合概率损失和骨骼姿态正则化，采用保形预测校准不确定性，生成3D置信区域。

Result: 在DeepDRR生成的合成X射线数据集上验证，显示强定位精度和良好校准的预测边界。

Conclusion: 该管道有潜力作为安全可靠自主C臂系统的组成部分，能够减少辐射暴露并提高手术效率。

Abstract: Accurate and reliable C-arm positioning is essential for fluoroscopy-guided
interventions. However, clinical workflows rely on manual alignment that
increases radiation exposure and procedural delays. In this work, we present a
pipeline that autonomously navigates the C-arm to predefined anatomical
landmarks utilizing X-ray images. Given an input X-ray image from an arbitrary
starting location on the operating table, the model predicts a 3D displacement
vector toward each target landmark along the body. To ensure reliable
deployment, we capture both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties in the
model's predictions and further calibrate them using conformal prediction. The
derived prediction regions are interpreted as 3D confidence regions around the
predicted landmark locations. The training framework combines a probabilistic
loss with skeletal pose regularization to encourage anatomically plausible
outputs. We validate our approach on a synthetic X-ray dataset generated from
DeepDRR. Results show not only strong localization accuracy across multiple
architectures but also well-calibrated prediction bounds. These findings
highlight the pipeline's potential as a component in safe and reliable
autonomous C-arm systems. Code is available at

TL;DR: 提出一个公式来评估图像质量评估(IQA)引擎的成本节省效果，并在背景修复用例中展示了51.61%的成本节省


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前深度生成模型生成的图像质量仍不及传统摄影方法，需要人工质量评估，但这个过程成本高昂且效率低

Method: 开发了一个公式来估计基于IQA引擎精度和通过率的成本节省，并应用AutoML解决方案进行验证

Result: 在背景修复用例中实现了51.61%的成本节省

Conclusion: 自动IQA预过滤可以显著降低获取高质量图像的平均成本

Abstract: Deep generative models have shown impressive progress in recent years, making
it possible to produce high quality images with a simple text prompt or a
reference image. However, state of the art technology does not yet meet the
quality standards offered by traditional photographic methods. For this reason,
production pipelines that use generated images often include a manual stage of
image quality assessment (IQA). This process is slow and expensive, especially
because of the low yield of automatically generated images that pass the
quality bar. The IQA workload can be reduced by introducing an automatic
pre-filtering stage, that will increase the overall quality of the images sent
to review and, therefore, reduce the average cost required to obtain a high
quality image. We present a formula that estimates the cost savings depending
on the precision and pass yield of a generic IQA engine. This formula is
applied in a use case of background inpainting, showcasing a significant cost
saving of 51.61% obtained with a simple AutoML solution.

Conclusion: 使用结构化文本作为中间空间来桥接fMRI信号和图像重建具有重要意义，fMRI信号与语言模型的文本空间更相似，而非基于视觉的空间或联合文本图像空间。

Abstract: Understanding how the brain encodes visual information is a central challenge
in neuroscience and machine learning. A promising approach is to reconstruct
visual stimuli, essentially images, from functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging
(fMRI) signals. This involves two stages: transforming fMRI signals into a
latent space and then using a pretrained generative model to reconstruct
images. The reconstruction quality depends on how similar the latent space is
to the structure of neural activity and how well the generative model produces
images from that space. Yet, it remains unclear which type of latent space best
supports this transformation and how it should be organized to represent visual
stimuli effectively. We present two key findings. First, fMRI signals are more
similar to the text space of a language model than to either a vision based
space or a joint text image space. Second, text representations and the
generative model should be adapted to capture the compositional nature of
visual stimuli, including objects, their detailed attributes, and
relationships. Building on these insights, we propose PRISM, a model that
Projects fMRI sIgnals into a Structured text space as an interMediate
representation for visual stimuli reconstruction. It includes an object centric
diffusion module that generates images by composing individual objects to
reduce object detection errors, and an attribute relationship search module
that automatically identifies key attributes and relationships that best align
with the neural activity. Extensive experiments on real world datasets
demonstrate that our framework outperforms existing methods, achieving up to an
8% reduction in perceptual loss. These results highlight the importance of
using structured text as the intermediate space to bridge fMRI signals and
image reconstruction.

Abstract: Mapping agriculture in tropical areas through remote sensing presents unique
challenges, including the lack of high-quality annotated data, the elevated

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为StretchySnake的灵活训练方法，通过动态调整时空分辨率来增强状态空间模型在视频理解中的适应性，解决了传统方法在时空灵活性方面的限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视频理解训练方法主要针对transformer设计，无法充分利用状态空间模型的独特优势，导致模型在面对训练时未见过的时空分辨率时性能下降，限制了模型在长短视频上的通用性。

Method: 提出灵活训练方法，在训练过程中采样不同时空分辨率的视频，并动态插值模型权重以适应任意时空尺度，使模型能够无缝处理从短片段到长活动的各种视频。

Result: 在短动作和长动作基准测试中，StretchySnake比transformer和状态空间模型基线性能提升高达28%，在细粒度动作识别上表现出强大的适应性。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一个简单的即插即用训练方案，使视频状态空间模型在各种动作识别场景中更加鲁棒、分辨率无关且高效。

Abstract: State space models (SSMs) have emerged as a competitive alternative to
transformers in various tasks. Their linear complexity and hidden-state
recurrence make them particularly attractive for modeling long sequences,
whereas attention becomes quadratically expensive. However, current training
methods for video understanding are tailored towards transformers and fail to
fully leverage the unique attributes of SSMs. For example, video models are
often trained at a fixed resolution and video length to balance the quadratic
scaling of attention cost against performance. Consequently, these models
suffer from degraded performance when evaluated on videos with spatial and
temporal resolutions unseen during training; a property we call spatio-temporal
inflexibility. In the context of action recognition, this severely limits a
model's ability to retain performance across both short- and long-form videos.
Therefore, we propose a flexible training method that leverages and improves
the inherent adaptability of SSMs. Our method samples videos at varying
temporal and spatial resolutions during training and dynamically interpolates
model weights to accommodate any spatio-temporal scale. This instills our SSM,
which we call StretchySnake, with spatio-temporal flexibility and enables it to
seamlessly handle videos ranging from short, fine-grained clips to long,
complex activities. We introduce and compare five different variants of
flexible training, and identify the most effective strategy for video SSMs. On
short-action (UCF-101, HMDB-51) and long-action (COIN, Breakfast) benchmarks,
StretchySnake outperforms transformer and SSM baselines alike by up to 28%,
with strong adaptability to fine-grained actions (SSV2, Diving-48). Therefore,
our method provides a simple drop-in training recipe that makes video SSMs more
robust, resolution-agnostic, and efficient across diverse action recognition
scenarios.

Motivation: 现有CNN模型难以捕捉全局面部特征，ViT能建模长距离空间关系但计算复杂度高，需要结合不同模型的优势来提升面部美观度预测性能。

Method: 使用Vision Transformer和Mamba视觉模型的异质集成架构，ViT负责全局面部结构和对称性，Mamba以线性复杂度建模长距离依赖关系，关注序列特征和纹理。

Result: 在SCUT-FBP5500数据集上取得PC=0.9212、MAE=0.2085、RMSE=0.2698的SOTA性能，并通过Grad-CAM可视化验证了两个骨干网络的互补特征提取能力。

Conclusion: VM-BeautyNet为计算美学提供了强大的新架构范式，通过融合ViT和Mamba的互补优势，显著提升了面部美观度预测性能，并提供了模型决策过程的可解释性分析。

Abstract: Facial Beauty Prediction (FBP) is a complex and challenging computer vision
task, aiming to model the subjective and intricate nature of human aesthetic
perception. While deep learning models, particularly Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNNs), have made significant strides, they often struggle to capture
the global, holistic facial features that are critical to human judgment.
Vision Transformers (ViT) address this by effectively modeling long-range
spatial relationships, but their quadratic complexity can be a bottleneck. This
paper introduces a novel, heterogeneous ensemble architecture,
\textbf{VM-BeautyNet}, that synergistically fuses the complementary strengths
of a Vision Transformer and a Mamba-based Vision model, a recent advancement in
State-Space Models (SSMs). The ViT backbone excels at capturing global facial
structure and symmetry, while the Mamba backbone efficiently models long-range
dependencies with linear complexity, focusing on sequential features and
textures. We evaluate our approach on the benchmark SCUT-FBP5500 dataset. Our
proposed VM-BeautyNet achieves state-of-the-art performance, with a
\textbf{Pearson Correlation (PC) of 0.9212}, a \textbf{Mean Absolute Error
(MAE) of 0.2085}, and a \textbf{Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 0.2698}.
Furthermore, through Grad-CAM visualizations, we provide interpretability
analysis that confirms the complementary feature extraction of the two
backbones, offering new insights into the model's decision-making process and
presenting a powerful new architectural paradigm for computational aesthetics.

Result: 图像分辨率越高，预测准确性越高，但呈现对数增长趋势，高像素数带来的收益递减。

Conclusion: CNN结合图像采集硬件能有效检测口腔鳞状细胞癌，图像分辨率对检测准确性有重要影响但存在收益递减效应。

Abstract: Oral Cavity Squamous Cell Carcinoma (OCSCC) is the most common type of head
and neck cancer. Due to the subtle nature of its early stages, deep and hidden
areas of development, and slow growth, OCSCC often goes undetected, leading to
preventable deaths. However, properly trained Convolutional Neural Networks
(CNNs), with their precise image segmentation techniques and ability to apply
kernel matrices to modify the RGB values of images for accurate image pattern
recognition, would be an effective means for early detection of OCSCC. Pairing
this neural network with image capturing and processing hardware would allow
increased efficacy in OCSCC detection. The aim of our project is to develop a
Convolutional Neural Network trained to recognize OCSCC, as well as to design a
physical hardware system to capture and process detailed images, in order to
determine the image quality required for accurate predictions. A CNN was
trained on 4293 training images consisting of benign and malignant tumors, as
well as negative samples, and was evaluated for its precision, recall, and Mean
Average Precision (mAP) in its predictions of OCSCC. A testing dataset of
randomly assorted images of cancerous, non-cancerous, and negative images was
chosen, and each image was altered to represent 5 common resolutions. This test
data set was thoroughly analyzed by the CNN and predictions were scored on the
basis of accuracy. The designed enhancement hardware was used to capture
detailed images, and its impact was scored. An application was developed to
facilitate the testing process and bring open access to the CNN. Images of
increasing resolution resulted in higher-accuracy predictions on a logarithmic
scale, demonstrating the diminishing returns of higher pixel counts.

Conclusion: 该方法为传统物体级重建提供了灵活渐进的替代方案，能够利用第一人称视角直播中的人-物交互线索进行动态场景建模。

Abstract: Human behaviors are the major causes of scene dynamics and inherently contain
rich cues regarding the dynamics. This paper formalizes a new task of proactive
scene decomposition and reconstruction, an online approach that leverages
human-object interactions to iteratively disassemble and reconstruct the
environment. By observing these intentional interactions, we can dynamically
refine the decomposition and reconstruction process, addressing inherent
ambiguities in static object-level reconstruction. The proposed system
effectively integrates multiple tasks in dynamic environments such as accurate
camera and object pose estimation, instance decomposition, and online map
updating, capitalizing on cues from human-object interactions in egocentric
live streams for a flexible, progressive alternative to conventional
object-level reconstruction methods. Aided by the Gaussian splatting technique,
accurate and consistent dynamic scene modeling is achieved with photorealistic
and efficient rendering. The efficacy is validated in multiple real-world
scenarios with promising advantages.

Motivation: 现有基于视觉语言模型(VLM)的视频异常检测方法计算成本高且视觉定位性能不稳定，阻碍了实时部署。

Method: 采用两阶段级联系统：离线学习正常行为规则，在线结合轻量级过滤和VLM细粒度推理；创新包括运动掩码提示和基于规则的偏差检测。

Result: 在四个数据集上的评估显示，Cerberus平均达到57.68 fps（151.79倍加速），97.2%的准确率与最先进的VLM方法相当。

Conclusion: Cerberus是实时视频分析的实际解决方案，在保持高准确率的同时显著提升了检测速度。

Abstract: Video anomaly detection (VAD) has rapidly advanced by recent development of
Vision-Language Models (VLMs). While these models offer superior zero-shot
detection capabilities, their immense computational cost and unstable visual
grounding performance hinder real-time deployment. To overcome these
challenges, we introduce Cerberus, a two-stage cascaded system designed for
efficient yet accurate real-time VAD. Cerberus learns normal behavioral rules
offline, and combines lightweight filtering with fine-grained VLM reasoning
during online inference. The performance gains of Cerberus come from two key
innovations: motion mask prompting and rule-based deviation detection. The
former directs the VLM's attention to regions relevant to motion, while the
latter identifies anomalies as deviations from learned norms rather than
enumerating possible anomalies. Extensive evaluations on four datasets show
that Cerberus on average achieves 57.68 fps on an NVIDIA L40S GPU, a
151.79$\times$ speedup, and 97.2\% accuracy comparable to the state-of-the-art
VLM-based VAD methods, establishing it as a practical solution for real-time

Motivation: 先前关于大型视觉语言模型成员推理攻击的研究报告了高成功率，但这些结果可能源于数据集构建中的分布偏差，而非真实识别成员状态。需要建立一个无偏基准来准确评估MIA方法的有效性。

Method: 引入包含6000张图像的受控基准测试，其中成员和非成员样本的分布经过仔细平衡，并提供三个不同训练阶段的真实成员标签。

Result: 在无偏条件下，最先进的MIA方法性能收敛到随机猜测水平，表明先前的高成功率主要源于数据集偏差。

Conclusion: OpenLVLM-MIA通过提供透明无偏的基准，阐明了当前LVLM上MIA研究的局限性，为开发更强的隐私保护技术奠定了坚实基础。

Abstract: OpenLVLM-MIA is a new benchmark that highlights fundamental challenges in
evaluating membership inference attacks (MIA) against large vision-language
models (LVLMs). While prior work has reported high attack success rates, our
analysis suggests that these results often arise from detecting distributional
bias introduced during dataset construction rather than from identifying true
membership status. To address this issue, we introduce a controlled benchmark
of 6{,}000 images where the distributions of member and non-member samples are
carefully balanced, and ground-truth membership labels are provided across
three distinct training stages. Experiments using OpenLVLM-MIA demonstrated
that the performance of state-of-the-art MIA methods converged to random chance
under unbiased conditions. By offering a transparent and unbiased benchmark,
OpenLVLM-MIA clarifies the current limitations of MIA research on LVLMs and
provides a solid foundation for developing stronger privacy-preserving
techniques.

Conclusion: Stroke2Sketch框架能够自适应地整合参考笔画特征到内容图像中，同时保持结构完整性，实现了高质量的草图风格迁移。

Abstract: Generating sketches guided by reference styles requires precise transfer of
stroke attributes, such as line thickness, deformation, and texture sparsity,
while preserving semantic structure and content fidelity. To this end, we
propose Stroke2Sketch, a novel training-free framework that introduces
cross-image stroke attention, a mechanism embedded within self-attention layers
to establish fine-grained semantic correspondences and enable accurate stroke
attribute transfer. This allows our method to adaptively integrate reference
stroke characteristics into content images while maintaining structural
integrity. Additionally, we develop adaptive contrast enhancement and
semantic-focused attention to reinforce content preservation and foreground
emphasis. Stroke2Sketch effectively synthesizes stylistically faithful sketches
that closely resemble handcrafted results, outperforming existing methods in
expressive stroke control and semantic coherence. Codes are available at

Motivation: 由于现有数据集规模不足，无法系统研究深度伪造检测任务的缩放规律，因此构建了目前最大的深度伪造检测数据集ScaleDF。

Method: 构建包含580万张真实图像（来自51个数据集）和880万张伪造图像（由102种深度伪造方法生成）的ScaleDF数据集，分析模型性能与真实域数量、伪造方法和训练图像数量的关系。

Conclusion: 缩放规律不仅有助于预测性能提升所需资源，还为以数据为中心的方式应对不断演变的深度伪造技术提供了启示。

Abstract: This paper presents a systematic study of scaling laws for the deepfake
detection task. Specifically, we analyze the model performance against the
number of real image domains, deepfake generation methods, and training images.
Since no existing dataset meets the scale requirements for this research, we
construct ScaleDF, the largest dataset to date in this field, which contains
over 5.8 million real images from 51 different datasets (domains) and more than
8.8 million fake images generated by 102 deepfake methods. Using ScaleDF, we
observe power-law scaling similar to that shown in large language models
(LLMs). Specifically, the average detection error follows a predictable
power-law decay as either the number of real domains or the number of deepfake
methods increases. This key observation not only allows us to forecast the
number of additional real domains or deepfake methods required to reach a
target performance, but also inspires us to counter the evolving deepfake
technology in a data-centric manner. Beyond this, we examine the role of
pre-training and data augmentations in deepfake detection under scaling, as
well as the limitations of scaling itself.

Result: Scale-DiT实现了2倍以上的推理加速和更低的内存使用，能够可靠地扩展到4K分辨率，在定量指标和定性比较中均优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 分层局部注意力与引导低分辨率锚点是推进超高清图像生成的有效方法。

Abstract: Ultra-high-resolution text-to-image generation demands both fine-grained
texture synthesis and globally coherent structure, yet current diffusion models
remain constrained to sub-$1K \times 1K$ resolutions due to the prohibitive
quadratic complexity of attention and the scarcity of native $4K$ training
data. We present \textbf{Scale-DiT}, a new diffusion framework that introduces
hierarchical local attention with low-resolution global guidance, enabling
efficient, scalable, and semantically coherent image synthesis at ultra-high
resolutions. Specifically, high-resolution latents are divided into fixed-size
local windows to reduce attention complexity from quadratic to near-linear,
while a low-resolution latent equipped with scaled positional anchors injects
global semantics. A lightweight LoRA adaptation bridges global and local
pathways during denoising, ensuring consistency across structure and detail. To
maximize inference efficiency, we repermute token sequence in Hilbert curve
order and implement a fused-kernel for skipping masked operations, resulting in
a GPU-friendly design. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Scale-DiT
achieves more than $2\times$ faster inference and lower memory usage compared
to dense attention baselines, while reliably scaling to $4K \times 4K$
resolution without requiring additional high-resolution training data. On both
quantitative benchmarks (FID, IS, CLIP Score) and qualitative comparisons,
Scale-DiT delivers superior global coherence and sharper local detail, matching
or outperforming state-of-the-art methods that rely on native 4K training.
Taken together, these results highlight hierarchical local attention with
guided low-resolution anchors as a promising and effective approach for
advancing ultra-high-resolution image generation.

TL;DR: DiffusionX是一个云边协同框架，通过轻量级设备端扩散模型快速生成预览图像，高容量云端模型进行最终精炼，结合噪声水平预测器动态平衡计算负载，在保持图像质量的同时显著降低生成时间和云工作负载。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在图像生成方面取得显著进展，但生成过程计算密集，用户需要迭代优化提示词，增加了延迟和云资源负担。

Method: 提出云边协同框架，设备端使用轻量扩散模型快速生成预览，云端使用高容量模型进行最终精炼；引入噪声水平预测器动态平衡计算负载。

Result: 相比Stable Diffusion v1.5平均生成时间减少15.8%，图像质量相当；相比Tiny-SD仅慢0.9%但图像质量显著提升。

Conclusion: DiffusionX在最小开销下展示了效率和可扩展性，有效解决了扩散模型生成延迟和云资源负担问题。

Abstract: Recent advances in diffusion models have driven remarkable progress in image
generation. However, the generation process remains computationally intensive,
and users often need to iteratively refine prompts to achieve the desired
results, further increasing latency and placing a heavy burden on cloud
resources. To address this challenge, we propose DiffusionX, a cloud-edge
collaborative framework for efficient multi-round, prompt-based generation. In
this system, a lightweight on-device diffusion model interacts with users by
rapidly producing preview images, while a high-capacity cloud model performs
final refinements after the prompt is finalized. We further introduce a noise
level predictor that dynamically balances the computation load, optimizing the
trade-off between latency and cloud workload. Experiments show that DiffusionX
reduces average generation time by 15.8% compared with Stable Diffusion v1.5,
while maintaining comparable image quality. Moreover, it is only 0.9% slower
than Tiny-SD with significantly improved image quality, thereby demonstrating
efficiency and scalability with minimal overhead.

TL;DR: TokenAR框架通过token级增强机制解决多参考图像生成中的身份混淆问题，包含token索引嵌入、指令token注入和身份token解耦策略，显著提升身份一致性和背景重建质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的自回归模型在多参考图像生成中难以解耦不同参考身份，存在身份混淆问题。

Method: 提出TokenAR框架，包含三个token级增强组件：1) Token Index Embedding聚类token索引；2) Instruct Token Injection注入额外视觉特征；3) 身份token解耦策略(ITD)引导token独立表示每个身份特征。

Result: 方法在多个参考图像生成任务中超越了当前最先进模型，实现了良好的身份一致性和高质量的背景重建。

Conclusion: TokenAR框架有效解决了多参考图像生成中的身份混淆问题，并发布了首个开源的大规模多参考图像生成数据集InstructAR。

Abstract: Autoregressive Model (AR) has shown remarkable success in conditional image
generation. However, these approaches for multiple reference generation
struggle with decoupling different reference identities. In this work, we
propose the TokenAR framework, specifically focused on a simple but effective
token-level enhancement mechanism to address reference identity confusion
problem. Such token-level enhancement consists of three parts, 1). Token Index
Embedding clusters the tokens index for better representing the same reference
images; 2). Instruct Token Injection plays as a role of extra visual feature
container to inject detailed and complementary priors for reference tokens; 3).
The identity-token disentanglement strategy (ITD) explicitly guides the token
representations toward independently representing the features of each
identity.This token-enhancement framework significantly augments the
capabilities of existing AR based methods in conditional image generation,
enabling good identity consistency while preserving high quality background
reconstruction. Driven by the goal of high-quality and high-diversity in
multi-subject generation, we introduce the InstructAR Dataset, the first
open-source, large-scale, multi-reference input, open domain image generation
dataset that includes 28K training pairs, each example has two reference
subjects, a relative prompt and a background with mask annotation, curated for
multiple reference image generation training and evaluating. Comprehensive
experiments validate that our approach surpasses current state-of-the-art
models in multiple reference image generation task. The implementation code and
datasets will be made publicly. Codes are available, see

*Junha Song,Sangdoo Yun,Dongyoon Han,Jaegul Choo,Byeongho Heo*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文挑战了多模态语言模型(MLLM)研究中关于性能主要继承自LLM骨干网络的假设，重点分析了视觉编码器在MLLM训练中的作用。研究发现强化学习(RL)相比监督微调(SFT)能产生更强且更精确的视觉表示，并提出了PIVOT方法，以极低成本显著提升视觉编码器性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前MLLM研究普遍假设模型性能主要继承自LLM骨干网络，导致对视觉编码器作用的理解不足。特别是从SFT到RL的训练范式转变，更需要分析训练策略如何重塑视觉编码器和MLLM。

Method: 通过多样化的实验分析视觉编码器，包括ImageNet分类、分割和梯度可视化。比较SFT和RL训练策略对MLLM的影响，并基于发现提出了PIVOT方法。

Result: RL相比SFT在强视觉相关的VQA基准上表现更优，能产生更强且更精确的视觉表示。PIVOT训练的视觉编码器性能优于更大、训练更充分的对应模型，且计算成本不到标准视觉预训练的1%。

Conclusion: MLLM的训练策略不仅影响下游任务表现，还从根本上重塑了视觉表示。RL训练能显著提升视觉编码器能力，PIVOT方法为MLLM视觉骨干的进步提供了高效路径。

Abstract: A dominant assumption in Multimodal Language Model (MLLM) research is that
its performance is largely inherited from the LLM backbone, given its immense
parameter scale and remarkable capabilities. This has created a void in the
understanding of the vision encoder, which determines how MLLMs perceive
images. The recent shift in MLLM training paradigms, from Supervised Finetuning
(SFT) to Reinforcement Learning (RL), magnifies this oversight-namely, the
significant lack of analysis on how such training reshapes the vision encoder
as well as the MLLM. To address this, we first investigate the impact of
training strategies on MLLMs, where RL shows a clear advantage over SFT in
strongly vision-related VQA benchmarks. Motivated by this, we conduct a
critical yet under-explored analysis of the vision encoder of MLLMs through
diverse and in-depth experiments, ranging from ImageNet classification and
segmentation to gradient visualization. Our results demonstrate that MLLM's
post-training strategy (i.e., SFT or RL) not only leads to distinct outcomes on
MLLM downstream tasks, but also fundamentally reshapes MLLM's underlying visual
representations. Specifically, the key finding of our study is that RL produces
stronger and precisely localized visual representations compared to SFT,
boosting the ability of the vision encoder for MLLM. We then reframe our
findings into a simple recipe for building strong vision encoders for MLLMs,
Preference-Instructed Vision OpTimization (PIVOT). When integrated into MLLMs,
a PIVOT-trained vision encoder outperforms even larger and more heavily-trained
counterparts, despite requiring less than 1% of the computational cost of
standard vision pretraining. This result opens an effective and efficient path
for advancing the vision backbones of MLLMs. Project page available at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有语言辅助图像聚类方法依赖CLIP特征空间筛选正名词，但缺乏理论依据，需要更严谨的筛选策略。

Method: 通过反向传播交叉熵损失的梯度幅度来衡量名词的积极性，理论分析证明该方法包含现有策略作为特例。

Result: 在多个基准测试中实现了最先进的聚类性能。

Conclusion: GradNorm框架为语言辅助图像聚类提供了理论保证的解决方案，显著提升了聚类效果。

Abstract: This paper investigates the recently emerged problem of Language-assisted
Image Clustering (LaIC), where textual semantics are leveraged to improve the
discriminability of visual representations to facilitate image clustering. Due
to the unavailability of true class names, one of core challenges of LaIC lies
in how to filter positive nouns, i.e., those semantically close to the images
of interest, from unlabeled wild corpus data. Existing filtering strategies are
predominantly based on the off-the-shelf feature space learned by CLIP;
however, despite being intuitive, these strategies lack a rigorous theoretical
foundation. To fill this gap, we propose a novel gradient-based framework,
termed as GradNorm, which is theoretically guaranteed and shows strong
empirical performance. In particular, we measure the positiveness of each noun
based on the magnitude of gradients back-propagated from the cross-entropy
between the predicted target distribution and the softmax output.
Theoretically, we provide a rigorous error bound to quantify the separability
of positive nouns by GradNorm and prove that GradNorm naturally subsumes
existing filtering strategies as extremely special cases of itself.
Empirically, extensive experiments show that GradNorm achieves the
state-of-the-art clustering performance on various benchmarks.

Motivation: 社交制造模式面临质量控制的重大挑战，主要困难来自产品高度定制化、生产碎片化小批量订单以及分布式站点成像环境差异。

Method: 构建MIRAD数据集，捕捉社交制造三个关键维度：多样化个性化产品、六个地理分散制造节点的数据收集、显著的成像异质性。

Result: 在MIRAD上评估最先进的异常检测方法，结果显示相比传统基准，所有模型性能显著下降，突显了现实世界个性化生产中缺陷检测的未解决复杂性。

Conclusion: MIRAD通过连接工业需求和学术研究，为开发工业5.0所需的稳健质量控制解决方案提供了现实基础。

Abstract: Social manufacturing leverages community collaboration and scattered
resources to realize mass individualization in modern industry. However, this
paradigm shift also introduces substantial challenges in quality control,
particularly in defect detection. The main difficulties stem from three
aspects. First, products often have highly customized configurations. Second,
production typically involves fragmented, small-batch orders. Third, imaging
environments vary considerably across distributed sites. To overcome the
scarcity of real-world datasets and tailored algorithms, we introduce the Mass
Individualization Robust Anomaly Detection (MIRAD) dataset. As the first
benchmark explicitly designed for anomaly detection in social manufacturing,
MIRAD captures three critical dimensions of this domain: (1) diverse
individualized products with large intra-class variation, (2) data collected
from six geographically dispersed manufacturing nodes, and (3) substantial
imaging heterogeneity, including variations in lighting, background, and motion
conditions. We then conduct extensive evaluations of state-of-the-art (SOTA)
anomaly detection methods on MIRAD, covering one-class, multi-class, and
zero-shot approaches. Results show a significant performance drop across all
models compared with conventional benchmarks, highlighting the unresolved
complexities of defect detection in real-world individualized production. By
bridging industrial requirements and academic research, MIRAD provides a
realistic foundation for developing robust quality control solutions essential
for Industry 5.0. The dataset is publicly available at

Abstract: The development of computer-assisted surgery systems depends on large-scale,
annotated datasets. Current resources for cataract surgery often lack the
diversity and annotation depth needed to train generalizable deep-learning
models. To address this gap, we present a dataset of 3,000 phacoemulsification
cataract surgery videos from two surgical centers, performed by surgeons with a

layers: temporal surgical phases, instance segmentation of instruments and
anatomical structures, instrument-tissue interaction tracking, and quantitative
skill scores based on the established competency rubrics like the ICO-OSCAR.
The technical quality of the dataset is supported by a series of benchmarking
experiments for key surgical AI tasks, including workflow recognition, scene
segmentation, and automated skill assessment. Furthermore, we establish a
domain adaptation baseline for the phase recognition task by training a model
on a subset of surgical centers and evaluating its performance on a held-out

Abstract: Learning 3D parametric shape models of objects has gained popularity in
vision and graphics and has showed broad utility in 3D reconstruction,
generation, understanding, and simulation. While powerful models exist for
humans and animals, equally expressive approaches for modeling plants are
lacking. In this work, we present Demeter, a data-driven parametric model that
encodes key factors of a plant morphology, including topology, shape,
articulation, and deformation into a compact learned representation. Unlike
previous parametric models, Demeter handles varying shape topology across
various species and models three sources of shape variation: articulation,
subcomponent shape variation, and non-rigid deformation. To advance crop plant
modeling, we collected a large-scale, ground-truthed dataset from a soybean
farm as a testbed. Experiments show that Demeter effectively synthesizes
shapes, reconstructs structures, and simulates biophysical processes. Code and

Conclusion: 该方法在保持与最先进方法相当精度的同时，显著提升了计算效率，适用于边缘设备的实时手部姿态估计任务。

Abstract: With the increasing ubiquity of AR/VR devices, the deployment of deep
learning models on edge devices has become a critical challenge. These devices
require real-time inference, low power consumption, and minimal latency. Many
framework designers face the conundrum of balancing efficiency and performance.
We design a light framework that adopts an encoder-decoder architecture and
introduces several key contributions aimed at improving both efficiency and
accuracy. We apply sparse convolution on a ResNet-18 backbone to exploit the
inherent sparsity in hand pose images, achieving a 42% end-to-end efficiency
improvement. Moreover, we propose our SPLite decoder. This new architecture
significantly boosts the decoding process's frame rate by 3.1x on the Raspberry
Pi 5, while maintaining accuracy on par. To further optimize performance, we
apply quantization-aware training, reducing memory usage while preserving
accuracy (PA-MPJPE increases only marginally from 9.0 mm to 9.1 mm on

Abstract: Bridging the gap between complex human instructions and precise 3D object
grounding remains a significant challenge in vision and robotics. Existing 3D
segmentation methods often struggle to interpret ambiguous, reasoning-based
instructions, while 2D vision-language models that excel at such reasoning lack
intrinsic 3D spatial understanding. In this paper, we introduce REALM, an
innovative MLLM-agent framework that enables open-world reasoning-based
segmentation without requiring extensive 3D-specific post-training. We perform
segmentation directly on 3D Gaussian Splatting representations, capitalizing on
their ability to render photorealistic novel views that are highly suitable for
MLLM comprehension. As directly feeding one or more rendered views to the MLLM
can lead to high sensitivity to viewpoint selection, we propose a novel
Global-to-Local Spatial Grounding strategy. Specifically, multiple global views
are first fed into the MLLM agent in parallel for coarse-level localization,
aggregating responses to robustly identify the target object. Then, several
close-up novel views of the object are synthesized to perform fine-grained
local segmentation, yielding accurate and consistent 3D masks. Extensive
experiments show that REALM achieves remarkable performance in interpreting
both explicit and implicit instructions across LERF, 3D-OVS, and our newly
introduced REALM3D benchmarks. Furthermore, our agent framework seamlessly
supports a range of 3D interaction tasks, including object removal,
replacement, and style transfer, demonstrating its practical utility and
versatility. Project page: https://ChangyueShi.github.io/REALM.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型(VLMs)在整合大语言模型和视觉输入方面表现出色，但往往无法充分使用视觉证据，要么依赖语言先验，要么在推理时使用文本捷径。虽然强化学习(RL)可以对齐模型与期望行为，但在VLMs中的应用因缺乏可扩展和可靠的奖励机制而受阻。

Method: 提出SSL4RL框架，将自监督学习(SSL)目标(如预测图像旋转或重建掩码补丁)重新表述为密集、自动的奖励信号，用于RL微调。

Result: SSL4RL显著提升了在视觉中心和视觉语言推理基准测试上的性能。通过系统消融研究，确定了影响SSL4RL任务有效性的关键因素，如任务难度、模型规模和与目标领域的语义对齐。

Conclusion: SSL4RL建立了一个通用且有效的范式，使用可验证的自监督目标来对齐多模态模型，并在图学习中也展示了其通用性，取得了显著收益。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have shown remarkable abilities by integrating
large language models with visual inputs. However, they often fail to utilize
visual evidence adequately, either depending on linguistic priors in
vision-centric tasks or resorting to textual shortcuts during reasoning.
Although reinforcement learning (RL) can align models with desired behaviors,
its application to VLMs has been hindered by the lack of scalable and reliable
reward mechanisms. To overcome this challenge, we propose SSL4RL, a novel
framework that leverages self-supervised learning (SSL) tasks as a source of
verifiable rewards for RL-based fine-tuning. Our approach reformulates SSL
objectives-such as predicting image rotation or reconstructing masked
patches-into dense, automatic reward signals, eliminating the need for human
preference data or unreliable AI evaluators. Experiments show that SSL4RL
substantially improves performance on both vision-centric and vision-language
reasoning benchmarks. Furthermore, through systematic ablations, we identify
key factors-such as task difficulty, model scale, and semantic alignment with
the target domain-that influence the effectiveness of SSL4RL tasks, offering
new design principles for future work. We also demonstrate the framework's
generality by applying it to graph learning, where it yields significant gains.
SSL4RL establishes a versatile and effective paradigm for aligning multimodal
models using verifiable, self-supervised objectives.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统方法将点和线匹配视为独立任务，而GlueStick虽然实现了联合匹配但架构过重，无法满足实时应用或边缘设备部署需求。

Method: 提出注意力线消息传递组件，显式地将线的连通性暴露给网络，实现节点间高效通信，构建轻量级联合匹配架构。

Result: 在多个基准测试中建立了新的最先进性能，同时显著降低了计算复杂度。

Conclusion: LightGlueStick通过高效的注意力线消息传递机制，成功实现了轻量级的点线联合匹配，为实时应用和边缘设备部署提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Lines and points are complementary local features, whose combination has
proven effective for applications such as SLAM and Structure-from-Motion. The
backbone of these pipelines are the local feature matchers, establishing
correspondences across images. Traditionally, point and line matching have been
treated as independent tasks. Recently, GlueStick proposed a GNN-based network
that simultaneously operates on points and lines to establish matches. While
running a single joint matching reduced the overall computational complexity,
the heavy architecture prevented real-time applications or deployment to edge
devices.
  Inspired by recent progress in point matching, we propose LightGlueStick, a
lightweight matcher for points and line segments. The key novel component in
our architecture is the Attentional Line Message Passing (ALMP), which
explicitly exposes the connectivity of the lines to the network, allowing for

*Haoran Sun,Chen Cai,Huiping Zhuang,Kong Aik Lee,Lap-Pui Chau,Yi Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了可解释深度伪造视频检测任务和EDVD-LLaMA多模态大语言模型推理框架，通过时空细微信息标记化和细粒度多模态思维链机制，提供可追溯的推理过程和可信解释。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统深度伪造视频检测方法缺乏透明度且泛化能力不足，需要能够识别伪造内容并提供可验证推理解释的检测器。

Method: 结合时空细微信息标记化提取全局和局部跨帧深度伪造特征，构建细粒度多模态思维链机制引入面部特征数据作为硬约束，实现像素级时空视频定位。

Result: 实验表明EDVD-LLaMA在检测准确性、可解释性以及处理跨伪造方法和跨数据集场景方面表现出色，具有优秀的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 相比之前的深度伪造视频检测方法，提供了更可解释和优越的解决方案。

Abstract: The rapid development of deepfake video technology has not only facilitated
artistic creation but also made it easier to spread misinformation. Traditional
deepfake video detection (DVD) methods face issues such as a lack of
transparency in their principles and insufficient generalization capabilities
to cope with evolving forgery techniques. This highlights an urgent need for
detectors that can identify forged content and provide verifiable reasoning
explanations. This paper proposes the explainable deepfake video detection
(EDVD) task and designs the EDVD-LLaMA multimodal, a large language model
(MLLM) reasoning framework, which provides traceable reasoning processes
alongside accurate detection results and trustworthy explanations. Our approach
first incorporates a Spatio-Temporal Subtle Information Tokenization (ST-SIT)
to extract and fuse global and local cross-frame deepfake features, providing
rich spatio-temporal semantic information input for MLLM reasoning. Second, we
construct a Fine-grained Multimodal Chain-of-Thought (Fg-MCoT) mechanism, which
introduces facial feature data as hard constraints during the reasoning process
to achieve pixel-level spatio-temporal video localization, suppress
hallucinated outputs, and enhance the reliability of the chain of thought. In
addition, we build an Explainable Reasoning FF++ benchmark dataset
(ER-FF++set), leveraging structured data to annotate videos and ensure quality
control, thereby supporting dual supervision for reasoning and detection.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that EDVD-LLaMA achieves outstanding
performance and robustness in terms of detection accuracy, explainability, and
its ability to handle cross-forgery methods and cross-dataset scenarios.
Compared to previous DVD methods, it provides a more explainable and superior
solution. The source code and dataset will be publicly available.

TL;DR: 本文提出了RefAtomNet++框架，用于解决指代原子视频动作识别任务，通过多层级语义对齐的交叉注意力和多轨迹Mamba建模，在RefAVA++数据集上实现了最先进的性能。


<details>

Motivation: 现有的RefAtomNet模型在跨模态信息对齐和检索方面存在局限，导致在定位目标人物和预测细粒度动作时表现不佳，需要改进跨模态token聚合能力。

Method: 提出RefAtomNet++框架，包含多层级语义对齐的交叉注意力机制和多轨迹Mamba建模，在部分关键词、场景属性和整体句子三个层级构建扫描轨迹，动态选择最近的视觉空间token。

Conclusion: RefAtomNet++通过改进的跨模态token聚合机制，显著提升了指代原子视频动作识别的性能，为复杂多人场景中的交互式人类动作分析提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Referring Atomic Video Action Recognition (RAVAR) aims to recognize
fine-grained, atomic-level actions of a specific person of interest conditioned
on natural language descriptions. Distinct from conventional action recognition
and detection tasks, RAVAR emphasizes precise language-guided action
understanding, which is particularly critical for interactive human action
analysis in complex multi-person scenarios. In this work, we extend our
previously introduced RefAVA dataset to RefAVA++, which comprises >2.9 million
frames and >75.1k annotated persons in total. We benchmark this dataset using
baselines from multiple related domains, including atomic action localization,
video question answering, and text-video retrieval, as well as our earlier
model, RefAtomNet. Although RefAtomNet surpasses other baselines by
incorporating agent attention to highlight salient features, its ability to
align and retrieve cross-modal information remains limited, leading to
suboptimal performance in localizing the target person and predicting
fine-grained actions. To overcome the aforementioned limitations, we introduce
RefAtomNet++, a novel framework that advances cross-modal token aggregation
through a multi-hierarchical semantic-aligned cross-attention mechanism
combined with multi-trajectory Mamba modeling at the partial-keyword,
scene-attribute, and holistic-sentence levels. In particular, scanning
trajectories are constructed by dynamically selecting the nearest visual
spatial tokens at each timestep for both partial-keyword and scene-attribute
levels. Moreover, we design a multi-hierarchical semantic-aligned
cross-attention strategy, enabling more effective aggregation of spatial and
temporal tokens across different semantic hierarchies. Experiments show that
RefAtomNet++ establishes new state-of-the-art results. The dataset and code are
released at https://github.com/KPeng9510/refAVA2.

Motivation: 传统物体检测框架在处理旋转物体时表现不佳，因为它们难以捕捉方向变化，特别是在航空影像、遥感和自动驾驶等应用中。

Method: 提出旋转不变损失函数，结合高斯边界框表示和Bhattacharyya距离，采用各向异性高斯表示来处理类方形物体的问题，并将该损失函数集成到最先进的深度学习旋转物体检测器中。

Result: 大量实验显示，与现有方法相比，在平均精度指标上取得了显著提升。

Conclusion: 该方法有潜力为旋转物体检测建立新的基准，对需要精确可靠物体定位的各种应用具有重要意义。

Abstract: Detecting rotated objects accurately and efficiently is a significant
challenge in computer vision, particularly in applications such as aerial
imagery, remote sensing, and autonomous driving. Although traditional object
detection frameworks are effective for axis-aligned objects, they often
underperform in scenarios involving rotated objects due to their limitations in
capturing orientation variations. This paper introduces an improved loss
function aimed at enhancing detection accuracy and robustness by leveraging the
Gaussian bounding box representation and Bhattacharyya distance. In addition,
we advocate for the use of an anisotropic Gaussian representation to address
the issues associated with isotropic variance in square-like objects. Our
proposed method addresses these challenges by incorporating a
rotation-invariant loss function that effectively captures the geometric
properties of rotated objects. We integrate this proposed loss function into
state-of-the-art deep learning-based rotated object detection detectors, and
extensive experiments demonstrated significant improvements in mean Average
Precision metrics compared to existing methods. The results highlight the
potential of our approach to establish new benchmark in rotated object
detection, with implications for a wide range of applications requiring precise
and reliable object localization irrespective of orientation.

TL;DR: VIPAMIN是一种视觉提示初始化策略，通过语义对齐和表示空间扩展来增强自监督模型的适应能力，在资源受限场景下显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉提示调优方法在处理挑战性任务和数据稀缺场景时效果有限，无法有效专业化提示或丰富表示空间，特别是在自监督骨干网络中。

Method: 提出VIPAMIN策略：(1) 在嵌入空间中将提示与语义信息丰富的区域对齐；(2) 在预训练子空间之外注入新的表示方向。仅需单次前向传播和轻量级操作。

Result: VIPAMIN在各种任务和数据集规模下持续提升性能，在视觉提示调优领域达到新的最先进水平。

Conclusion: VIPAMIN通过简单的初始化策略有效解决了自监督模型在视觉提示调优中的适应问题，为资源受限场景提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: In the era of large-scale foundation models, fully fine-tuning pretrained
networks for each downstream task is often prohibitively resource-intensive.
Prompt tuning offers a lightweight alternative by introducing tunable prompts
while keeping the backbone frozen. However, existing visual prompt tuning
methods often fail to specialize the prompts or enrich the representation
space--especially when applied to self-supervised backbones. We show that these
limitations become especially pronounced in challenging tasks and data-scarce
settings, where effective adaptation is most critical. In this work, we
introduce VIPAMIN, a visual prompt initialization strategy that enhances
adaptation of self-supervised models by (1) aligning prompts with semantically
informative regions in the embedding space, and (2) injecting novel
representational directions beyond the pretrained subspace. Despite its
simplicity--requiring only a single forward pass and lightweight
operations--VIPAMIN consistently improves performance across diverse tasks and
dataset sizes, setting a new state of the art in visual prompt tuning. Our code

TL;DR: 提出一种弱监督域自适应方法，利用稀疏点标注进行线粒体分割，通过多任务学习和跨教学机制提升性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决电子显微镜图像中线粒体分割的标注成本高问题，传统无监督域自适应方法在实际应用中性能较低

Method: 多任务学习框架联合分割和中心检测，采用跨教学机制和类聚焦跨域对比学习，以及基于实例感知的伪标签选择策略

Result: 在挑战性数据集上优于现有UDA和WDA方法，显著缩小与监督上限的性能差距

Conclusion: 该方法在弱监督和完全无监督设置下都取得了显著改进，为生物医学图像分析提供了有效的解决方案

Abstract: Annotation-efficient segmentation of the numerous mitochondria instances from
various electron microscopy (EM) images is highly valuable for biological and
neuroscience research. Although unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) methods
can help mitigate domain shifts and reduce the high costs of annotating each
domain, they typically have relatively low performance in practical
applications. Thus, we investigate weakly supervised domain adaptation (WDA)
that utilizes additional sparse point labels on the target domain, which
require minimal annotation effort and minimal expert knowledge. To take full
use of the incomplete and imprecise point annotations, we introduce a multitask
learning framework that jointly conducts segmentation and center detection with
a novel cross-teaching mechanism and class-focused cross-domain contrastive
learning. While leveraging unlabeled image regions is essential, we introduce
segmentation self-training with a novel instance-aware pseudo-label (IPL)
selection strategy. Unlike existing methods that typically rely on pixel-wise
pseudo-label filtering, the IPL semantically selects reliable and diverse
pseudo-labels with the help of the detection task. Comprehensive validations
and comparisons on challenging datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms
existing UDA and WDA methods, significantly narrowing the performance gap with
the supervised upper bound. Furthermore, under the UDA setting, our method also
achieves substantial improvements over other UDA techniques.

Motivation: 现有方法主要基于历史信息做决策，忽略了行动的未来影响和长期结果，需要开发具有前瞻性的智能体。

Method: 使用Q学习训练Q模型生成Q特征描述行动的未来潜在信息，通过跨模态未来编码器将任务无关的Q特征与导航指令结合，产生反映未来前景的行动分数，结合历史分数实现A*式搜索策略。

Result: 在广泛使用的目标导向VLN数据集上进行的大量实验验证了所提方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 该方法通过整合未来信息显著提升了目标导向视觉语言导航的性能，证明了前瞻性决策的重要性。

Abstract: In this work we concentrate on the task of goal-oriented Vision-and-Language
Navigation (VLN). Existing methods often make decisions based on historical
information, overlooking the future implications and long-term outcomes of the
actions. In contrast, we aim to develop a foresighted agent. Specifically, we
draw upon Q-learning to train a Q-model using large-scale unlabeled trajectory
data, in order to learn the general knowledge regarding the layout and object
relations within indoor scenes. This model can generate a Q-feature, analogous
to the Q-value in traditional Q-network, for each candidate action, which
describes the potential future information that may be observed after taking
the specific action. Subsequently, a cross-modal future encoder integrates the
task-agnostic Q-feature with navigation instructions to produce a set of action
scores reflecting future prospects. These scores, when combined with the
original scores based on history, facilitate an A*-style searching strategy to
effectively explore the regions that are more likely to lead to the
destination. Extensive experiments conducted on widely used goal-oriented VLN
datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

TL;DR: HGC-Avatar是一个用于动态3D数字人高效传输和高质量渲染的分层高斯压缩框架，通过结构层和运动层的解耦设计，支持分层压缩、渐进解码和可控渲染。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于3D高斯泼溅的压缩方法缺乏人体先验知识，导致在解码端的比特率效率和重建质量不理想，阻碍了在可流式3D虚拟人系统中的应用。

Method: 将高斯表示解耦为结构层（通过StyleUNet生成器将姿态映射到高斯）和运动层（利用SMPL-X模型紧凑表示时序姿态变化），采用分层设计支持分层压缩和渐进解码，并加入面部注意力机制来保持身份和表情细节。

Result: 实验结果表明，HGC-Avatar为快速3D虚拟人渲染提供了可流式解决方案，在视觉质量和压缩效率方面显著优于现有方法。

Conclusion: HGC-Avatar通过结合人体先验知识的分层高斯压缩框架，成功解决了动态3D虚拟人在传输和渲染中的效率与质量问题。

Abstract: Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have enabled fast,
photorealistic rendering of dynamic 3D scenes, showing strong potential in
immersive communication. However, in digital human encoding and transmission,
the compression methods based on general 3DGS representations are limited by
the lack of human priors, resulting in suboptimal bitrate efficiency and
reconstruction quality at the decoder side, which hinders their application in
streamable 3D avatar systems. We propose HGC-Avatar, a novel Hierarchical
Gaussian Compression framework designed for efficient transmission and
high-quality rendering of dynamic avatars. Our method disentangles the Gaussian
representation into a structural layer, which maps poses to Gaussians via a
StyleUNet-based generator, and a motion layer, which leverages the SMPL-X model
to represent temporal pose variations compactly and semantically. This
hierarchical design supports layer-wise compression, progressive decoding, and
controllable rendering from diverse pose inputs such as video sequences or
text. Since people are most concerned with facial realism, we incorporate a
facial attention mechanism during StyleUNet training to preserve identity and
expression details under low-bitrate constraints. Experimental results
demonstrate that HGC-Avatar provides a streamable solution for rapid 3D avatar
rendering, while significantly outperforming prior methods in both visual
quality and compression efficiency.

TL;DR: PRISMM-Bench是首个基于真实科学论文中审稿人标记不一致性的多模态基准测试，评估大型多模态模型在检测、纠正和推理跨文本、图表、方程不一致性的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试要么隔离单一模态，要么依赖合成错误，无法捕捉真实科学论文中跨模态不一致性的复杂性和领域特异性。

Method: 通过多阶段流程（审稿挖掘、LLM辅助过滤、人工验证）从242篇论文中收集262个不一致性，设计三个任务：不一致性识别、纠正和配对匹配，并引入结构化JSON答案表示以减少语言偏见。

Result: 对21个领先LMM的基准测试显示性能极低（26.1-54.2%），包括大型开源模型（GLM-4.5V 106B, InternVL3 78B）和专有模型（Gemini 2.5 Pro, GPT-5）。

Conclusion: 结果凸显了多模态科学推理的挑战性，需要推动开发更可信的科学助手。

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) are increasingly applied to scientific
research, yet it remains unclear whether they can reliably understand and
reason over the multimodal complexity of papers. A central challenge lies in
detecting and resolving inconsistencies across text, figures, tables, and
equations, issues that are often subtle, domain-specific, and ultimately
undermine clarity, reproducibility, and trust. Existing benchmarks overlook
this issue, either isolating single modalities or relying on synthetic errors
that fail to capture real-world complexity. We introduce PRISMM-Bench
(Peer-Review-sourced Inconsistency Set for Multimodal Models), the first
benchmark grounded in real reviewer-flagged inconsistencies in scientific
papers. Through a multi-stage pipeline of review mining, LLM-assisted filtering
and human verification, we curate 262 inconsistencies from 242 papers. Based on
this set, we design three tasks, namely inconsistency identification, remedy
and pair matching, which assess a model's capacity to detect, correct, and
reason over inconsistencies across different modalities. Furthermore, to
address the notorious problem of choice-only shortcuts in multiple-choice
evaluation, where models exploit answer patterns without truly understanding
the question, we further introduce structured JSON-based answer representations
that minimize linguistic biases by reducing reliance on superficial stylistic
cues. We benchmark 21 leading LMMs, including large open-weight models
(GLM-4.5V 106B, InternVL3 78B) and proprietary models (Gemini 2.5 Pro, GPT-5
with high reasoning). Results reveal strikingly low performance (26.1-54.2%),
underscoring the challenge of multimodal scientific reasoning and motivating
progress towards trustworthy scientific assistants.

Method: 扩展YOLOv8架构，增加卷积分支进行多任务学习：缺货检测、产品分割和深度估计。深度分支使用Depth Anything V2生成伪标签训练，并提出深度归一化方法稳定训练。

Result: 实验结果显示该方法超越现有最佳缺货检测方法1.8% mAP，消融研究证实辅助学习提升3.7% mAP，深度归一化提升4.2% mAP。

Conclusion: OOS-DSD通过多任务辅助学习和深度归一化有效提升了缺货检测性能，证明了辅助学习在零售视觉任务中的价值。

Abstract: Out-of-stock (OOS) detection is a very important retail verification process
that aims to infer the unavailability of products in their designated areas on
the shelf. In this paper, we introduce OOS-DSD, a novel deep learning-based
method that advances OOS detection through auxiliary learning. In particular,
we extend a well-established YOLOv8 object detection architecture with
additional convolutional branches to simultaneously detect OOS, segment
products, and estimate scene depth. While OOS detection and product
segmentation branches are trained using ground truth data, the depth estimation
branch is trained using pseudo-labeled annotations produced by the
state-of-the-art (SOTA) depth estimation model Depth Anything V2. Furthermore,
since the aforementioned pseudo-labeled depth estimates display relative depth,
we propose an appropriate depth normalization procedure that stabilizes the
training process. The experimental results show that the proposed method
surpassed the performance of the SOTA OOS detection methods by 1.8% of the mean
average precision (mAP). In addition, ablation studies confirm the
effectiveness of auxiliary learning and the proposed depth normalization
procedure, with the former increasing mAP by 3.7% and the latter by 4.2%.

Motivation: 开发一种以代表性为中心的方法，利用图结构和注意力机制来更好地捕捉图像之间的相似性关系和关键特征，提高图像分类和检索的准确性。

Method: 构建图像节点图，使用图注意力网络自编码器生成上下文感知的潜在表示，从中提取类别代表，通过比较查询图像代表与类别代表进行分类，并在对应类别中检索最相似图像。

Conclusion: 基于图注意力网络自编码器的代表性中心方法能够有效提升图像分类和检索性能，通过注意力机制捕捉关键特征和关系。

Abstract: We propose a method for image categorization and retrieval that leverages
graphs and a graph attention network (GAT)-based autoencoder. Our approach is
representative-centric, that is, we execute the categorization and retrieval
process via the representative models we construct for the images and image
categories. We utilize a graph where nodes represent images (or their
representatives) and edges capture similarity relationships. GAT highlights
important features and relationships between images, enabling the autoencoder
to construct context-aware latent representations that capture the key features
of each image relative to its neighbors. We obtain category representatives
from these embeddings and categorize a query image by comparing its
representative to the category representatives. We then retrieve the most
similar image to the query image within its identified category. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of our representative-centric approach through experiments
with both the GAT autoencoders and standard feature-based techniques.

TL;DR: READ是一种微调方法，通过添加token级重构和句子级对齐两个辅助目标来增强视觉语言模型的组合推理能力，在多个基准测试中达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的视觉语言模型在组合推理方面表现不佳，主要原因是文本编码器倾向于关注单个单词而非它们之间的关系，这种局限性被对比训练强化，主要将单词与视觉对象对齐。

Method: READ方法在对比学习基础上添加两个辅助目标：(1) token级重构目标 - 使用冻结的预训练解码器基于原始标题的嵌入重构替代标题；(2) 句子级对齐目标 - 在嵌入空间中显式对齐释义句子。

Result: READ-CLIP在五个主要组合推理基准测试中达到最先进性能，比最强的传统微调基线提升高达4.1%。应用于现有CLIP变体（包括NegCLIP和FSC-CLIP）也能提升这些基准测试的性能。

Conclusion: 重构和对齐目标提供互补优势：重构鼓励编码器捕捉标题内单词间的关系，而对齐确保不同措辞的释义具有一致的表示。

Abstract: Despite recent advances, vision-language models trained with standard
contrastive objectives still struggle with compositional reasoning -- the
ability to understand structured relationships between visual and linguistic
elements. This shortcoming is largely due to the tendency of the text encoder
to focus on individual words rather than their relations, a limitation
reinforced by contrastive training that primarily aligns words with visual
objects. In this paper, we introduce REconstruction and Alignment of text
Descriptions (READ), a fine-tuning method designed to enhance compositional
reasoning by adding two auxiliary objectives to the contrastive learning: (1) a
token-level reconstruction objective, where a frozen pre-trained decoder
reconstructs alternative captions based on the embedding of the original
caption; and (2) a sentence-level alignment objective, which explicitly aligns
paraphrased sentences in the embedding space. We show that READ-CLIP, a model
derived by applying the READ method to the pre-trained CLIP model, achieves the
state-of-the-art performance across five major compositional reasoning
benchmarks, outperforming the strongest conventional fine-tuning baseline by up
to 4.1%. Furthermore, applying the READ to existing CLIP variants (including
NegCLIP and FSC-CLIP) also improves performance on these benchmarks.
Quantitative and qualitative analyses reveal that our proposed objectives --
reconstruction and alignment -- offer complementary benefits: the former
encourages the encoder to capture relationships between words within a caption,
while the latter ensures consistent representations for paraphrases expressed
with different wording.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法使用预定义区域和固定时间尺度，难以建模随时间动态变化的运动区域和适应其特定模式

Result: 在多个基准数据集上达到最先进的性能

Conclusion: GaitRDAE框架能够有效处理动态变化的运动区域，提升步态识别准确性

Abstract: Deep learning-based gait recognition has achieved great success in various
applications. The key to accurate gait recognition lies in considering the
unique and diverse behavior patterns in different motion regions, especially
when covariates affect visual appearance. However, existing methods typically
use predefined regions for temporal modeling, with fixed or equivalent temporal
scales assigned to different types of regions, which makes it difficult to
model motion regions that change dynamically over time and adapt to their
specific patterns. To tackle this problem, we introduce a Region-aware Dynamic
Aggregation and Excitation framework (GaitRDAE) that automatically searches for
motion regions, assigns adaptive temporal scales and applies corresponding
attention. Specifically, the framework includes two core modules: the
Region-aware Dynamic Aggregation (RDA) module, which dynamically searches the
optimal temporal receptive field for each region, and the Region-aware Dynamic
Excitation (RDE) module, which emphasizes the learning of motion regions
containing more stable behavior patterns while suppressing attention to static
regions that are more susceptible to covariates. Experimental results show that
GaitRDAE achieves state-of-the-art performance on several benchmark datasets.

TL;DR: 本文提出了首个基于真实世界政治深度伪造事件的系统基准测试，评估了现有深度伪造检测器在真实政治场景下的表现，发现现有检测器普遍表现不佳，需要开发更具政治情境化的检测框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI生成内容的快速扩散增加了错误信息的风险，特别是政治深度伪造会扭曲真相并破坏对政治机构的信任。现有检测模型大多在实验室控制的合成数据集上训练和验证，限制了其在真实世界政治深度伪造上的泛化能力。

Method: 基于政治深度伪造事件数据库，构建了首个系统基准测试，对来自学术界、政府和行业的最先进深度伪造检测器进行了系统评估。

Result: 学术界和政府的检测器表现相对较差，付费检测工具比免费模型性能稍高，但所有评估的检测器都难以有效泛化到真实政治深度伪造，且容易受到简单操作的攻击，特别是在视频领域。

Conclusion: 研究结果强调了开发政治情境化深度伪造检测框架的必要性，以在真实世界环境中更好地保护公众。

Abstract: The rapid proliferation of AI-generated content, driven by advances in
generative adversarial networks, diffusion models, and multimodal large
language models, has made the creation and dissemination of synthetic media
effortless, heightening the risks of misinformation, particularly political
deepfakes that distort truth and undermine trust in political institutions. In
turn, governments, research institutions, and industry have strongly promoted
deepfake detection initiatives as solutions. Yet, most existing models are
trained and validated on synthetic, laboratory-controlled datasets, limiting
their generalizability to the kinds of real-world political deepfakes
circulating on social platforms that affect the public. In this work, we
introduce the first systematic benchmark based on the Political Deepfakes
Incident Database, a curated collection of real-world political deepfakes
shared on social media since 2018. Our study includes a systematic evaluation
of state-of-the-art deepfake detectors across academia, government, and
industry. We find that the detectors from academia and government perform
relatively poorly. While paid detection tools achieve relatively higher
performance than free-access models, all evaluated detectors struggle to
generalize effectively to authentic political deepfakes, and are vulnerable to
simple manipulations, especially in the video domain. Results urge the need for
politically contextualized deepfake detection frameworks to better safeguard
the public in real-world settings.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型在跨模态任务中表现出色，但物体幻觉问题（模型生成看似合理但不准确的物体描述）仍然是一个重大挑战。与之前关注LLM组件的研究不同，本文首次将LVLM幻觉追溯到视觉编码器，并识别了三个关键问题：统计偏差、固有偏差和脆弱性。

Method: 提出SHIELD框架，采用三种策略：重新加权视觉标记以减少统计偏差，引入噪声衍生标记以对抗固有偏差，应用对抗攻击与对比解码来解决脆弱性问题。

Result: 实验表明SHIELD能有效缓解不同基准测试和LVLM家族中的物体幻觉问题，同时在通用LVLM基准上表现优异，展示了其广泛适用性。

Conclusion: SHIELD是一个无需训练的有效框架，能够显著减少大型视觉语言模型中的物体幻觉，具有广泛的适用性。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) excel in diverse cross-modal tasks.
However, object hallucination, where models produce plausible but inaccurate
object descriptions, remains a significant challenge. In contrast to previous
work focusing on LLM components, this paper is the first to trace LVLM
hallucinations to visual encoders and identifies three key issues: statistical
bias, inherent bias, and vulnerability. To address these challenges, we propose
SHIELD, a training-free framework that mitigates hallucinations through three
strategies: re-weighting visual tokens to reduce statistical bias, introducing
noise-derived tokens to counter inherent bias, and applying adversarial attacks
with contrastive decoding to address vulnerability. Experiments demonstrate
that SHIELD effectively mitigates object hallucinations across diverse
benchmarks and LVLM families. Moreover, SHIELD achieves strong performance on
the general LVLM benchmark, highlighting its broad applicability. Code will be
released.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VisionSelector是一个轻量级的即插即用框架，通过可学习的决策过程解决MLLMs中视觉令牌压缩问题，使用可微分Top-K机制和课程退火策略，在保持性能的同时显著提升计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在处理高分辨率图像或多图像输入时面临计算和内存瓶颈，现有令牌压缩技术受限于启发式规则，可能丢弃关键信息或在激进压缩率下性能急剧下降。

Method: 提出VisionSelector框架，包含与MLLM主干解耦的打分器模块，采用可微分Top-K机制和课程退火策略，实现端到端可学习的令牌选择过程。

Result: 仅需12.85M可训练参数，在30%保留预算下保持MME 100%准确率，在10%保留预算下比先前方法提升12.14%，预填充速度翻倍。

Conclusion: VisionSelector提供了一种高效且自适应的令牌压缩解决方案，在各种压缩预算下均表现出优越性能，具有良好的泛化能力。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) encounter significant computational
and memory bottlenecks from the massive number of visual tokens generated by
high-resolution images or multi-image inputs. Previous token compression
techniques are often constrained by heuristic rules that risk discarding
critical information. They may suffer from biases, such as attention sinks,
that lead to sharp performance drops under aggressive compression ratios. To
address these limitations, we reformulate token compression as a lightweight
plug-and-play framework that reformulates token compression into an end-to-end
learnable decision process. To be specific, we propose VisionSelector, a scorer
module decoupled from the MLLM backbone that incorporates a differentiable
Top-K mechanism and a curriculum annealing strategy to bridge the
training-inference gap, enabling efficient and adaptive token selection various
arbitrary compression rates. Remarkably lightweight with only 12.85M trainable
parameters, VisionSelector demonstrates generalization across various
compression rates and adaptively identifying critical tokens. This leads to
superior performance across all compression budgets, evidenced by preserving
100% accuracy on MME with 30% retention budget, outperforming prior methods by
12.14% at 10% retention budget, and doubling prefill speed. Our code is

Abstract: Medical imaging plays a vital role in modern diagnostics; however,
interpreting high-resolution radiological data remains time-consuming and
susceptible to variability among clinicians. Traditional image processing
techniques often lack the precision, robustness, and speed required for
real-time clinical use. To overcome these limitations, this paper introduces a
deep learning framework for real-time medical image analysis designed to

imaging modalities, including X-ray, CT, and MRI. The proposed system
integrates advanced neural network architectures such as U-Net, EfficientNet,
and Transformer-based models with real-time optimization strategies including
model pruning, quantization, and GPU acceleration. The framework enables
flexible deployment on edge devices, local servers, and cloud infrastructures,
ensuring seamless interoperability with clinical systems such as PACS and EHR.
Experimental evaluations on public benchmark datasets demonstrate
state-of-the-art performance, achieving classification accuracies above 92%,
segmentation Dice scores exceeding 91%, and inference times below 80
milliseconds. Furthermore, visual explanation tools such as Grad-CAM and
segmentation overlays enhance transparency and clinical interpretability. These
results indicate that the proposed framework can substantially accelerate
diagnostic workflows, reduce clinician workload, and support trustworthy AI
integration in time-critical healthcare environments.

Motivation: 解决小型无人机在室内环境中的自主导航问题，避免对GPS和昂贵传感器（如LiDAR）的依赖，同时应对计算资源受限平台的挑战。

Method: 使用知识蒸馏框架，SVM教师生成训练数据训练轻量级U-Net学生网络进行实时语义分割；提出自适应尺度因子算法将非度量单目深度预测转换为准确度量距离；通过端到端学习训练紧凑神经网络学习完整飞行策略。

Conclusion: 该工作推进了结构化环境中基于视觉的无人机导航实践，解决了度量深度估计和计算效率挑战，可在资源受限平台上部署。

Abstract: This paper presents a vision-only autonomous flight system for small UAVs
operating in controlled indoor environments. The system combines semantic
segmentation with monocular depth estimation to enable obstacle avoidance,
scene exploration, and autonomous safe landing operations without requiring GPS
or expensive sensors such as LiDAR. A key innovation is an adaptive scale
factor algorithm that converts non-metric monocular depth predictions into
accurate metric distance measurements by leveraging semantic ground plane
detection and camera intrinsic parameters, achieving a mean distance error of
14.4 cm. The approach uses a knowledge distillation framework where a
color-based Support Vector Machine (SVM) teacher generates training data for a
lightweight U-Net student network (1.6M parameters) capable of real-time
semantic segmentation. For more complex environments, the SVM teacher can be
replaced with a state-of-the-art segmentation model. Testing was conducted in a
controlled 5x4 meter laboratory environment with eight cardboard obstacles
simulating urban structures. Extensive validation across 30 flight tests in a
real-world environment and 100 flight tests in a digital-twin environment
demonstrates that the combined segmentation and depth approach increases the
distance traveled during surveillance and reduces mission time while
maintaining 100% success rates. The system is further optimized through
end-to-end learning, where a compact student neural network learns complete
flight policies from demonstration data generated by our best-performing
method, achieving an 87.5% autonomous mission success rate. This work advances
practical vision-based drone navigation in structured environments,
demonstrating solutions for metric depth estimation and computational
efficiency challenges that enable deployment on resource-constrained platforms.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了MultiVerse多轮对话基准测试，包含647个对话，涵盖12个VLM评估基准的484个任务，使用GPT-4o作为自动评估器，评估18个VLMs发现即使在复杂对话中最佳模型成功率仅50%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多轮对话数据集无法完全捕捉真实应用中复杂对话场景的广度和深度，需要更全面的评估基准来测试VLMs的多轮交互能力。

Method: 从12个流行的VLM评估基准中提取647个对话，每个对话平均4轮，使用基于检查表的评估方法，利用GPT-4o作为自动评估器，测量37个关键方面的性能。

Result: 评估18个VLMs显示，即使最强模型（如GPT-4o）在复杂多轮对话中也仅达到50%成功率；提供完整对话上下文显著提升了较小或较弱模型的性能。

Conclusion: MultiVerse是评估VLMs多轮交互能力的全面基准，揭示了当前模型在多轮对话中的局限性，强调了上下文学习的重要性。

Abstract: Vision-and-Language Models (VLMs) have shown impressive capabilities on
single-turn benchmarks, yet real-world applications often demand more intricate
multi-turn dialogues. Existing multi-turn datasets (e.g, MMDU, ConvBench) only
partially capture the breadth and depth of conversational scenarios encountered
by users. In this work, we introduce MultiVerse, a novel multi-turn
conversation benchmark featuring 647 dialogues - each averaging four turns -
derived from a diverse set of 12 popular VLM evaluation benchmarks. With 484
tasks and 484 interaction goals, MultiVerse covers a wide range of topics, from
factual knowledge and perception to advanced reasoning tasks such as
mathematics and coding. To facilitate robust assessment, we propose a
checklist-based evaluation method that leverages GPT-4o as the automated
evaluator, measuring performance across 37 key aspects, including perceptual
accuracy, linguistic clarity, and factual correctness. We evaluate 18 VLMs on
MultiVerse, revealing that even the strongest models (e.g., GPT-4o) achieve
only a 50% success rate in complex multi-turn conversations, highlighting the
dataset's challenging nature. Notably, we find that providing full dialogue
context significantly enhances performance for smaller or weaker models,
emphasizing the importance of in-context learning. We believe MultiVerse is a
landscape of evaluating multi-turn interaction abilities for VLMs.

TL;DR: 提出了一种使用检索增强生成的方法，通过图数据库和Cypher查询语言接口来连接大型语言模型与3D场景图，解决自然语言接地问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法将场景图序列化为文本放入LLM上下文窗口，但这种方法无法扩展到大型或丰富的3D场景图。需要一种更高效的连接自然语言与机器人世界表示的方法。

Method: 使用检索增强生成方法，将3D场景图编码到图数据库中，为LLM提供Cypher查询语言作为工具接口，使其能够检索与任务相关的数据。

Result: 在指令跟随和场景问答任务上的评估显示，使用Cypher接口的方法在大型复杂图上显著优于基线方法，性能大幅提升，同时大幅减少了场景图内容的token数量。

Conclusion: Cypher作为3D场景图的接口，在本地和云端模型上都能显著扩展到大型复杂图，为接地语言任务带来巨大性能改进。

Abstract: In order to provide a robot with the ability to understand and react to a
user's natural language inputs, the natural language must be connected to the
robot's underlying representations of the world. Recently, large language
models (LLMs) and 3D scene graphs (3DSGs) have become a popular choice for
grounding natural language and representing the world. In this work, we address
the challenge of using LLMs with 3DSGs to ground natural language. Existing
methods encode the scene graph as serialized text within the LLM's context
window, but this encoding does not scale to large or rich 3DSGs. Instead, we
propose to use a form of Retrieval Augmented Generation to select a subset of
the 3DSG relevant to the task. We encode a 3DSG in a graph database and provide
a query language interface (Cypher) as a tool to the LLM with which it can
retrieve relevant data for language grounding. We evaluate our approach on
instruction following and scene question-answering tasks and compare against
baseline context window and code generation methods. Our results show that
using Cypher as an interface to 3D scene graphs scales significantly better to
large, rich graphs on both local and cloud-based models. This leads to large
performance improvements in grounded language tasks while also substantially
reducing the token count of the scene graph content. A video supplement is

TL;DR: 提出了一种针对病理学基础模型的通用可转移对抗扰动(UTAP)，这是一种固定且微弱的噪声模式，能够系统性地破坏多个病理学基础模型的特征表示能力，导致下游任务性能显著下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 揭示病理学基础模型的关键脆弱性，建立高标准的模型鲁棒性评估基准，为AI在病理学中的安全可靠部署提供必要的对抗训练资产。

Method: 使用深度学习优化生成固定的微弱噪声模式(UTAP)，该扰动可应用于不同的视野范围，并能成功迁移到未见过的黑盒病理学基础模型。

Result: 在各种最先进的病理学基础模型和多个数据集上系统评估，UTAP通过视觉上难以察觉的输入图像修改，导致模型性能显著下降，表现出跨数据分布和跨模型的通用性和可转移性。

Conclusion: UTAP构成了对各种新兴病理学基础模型及其应用的广泛威胁，强调了推进防御机制的必要性，并为模型鲁棒性评估建立了关键基准。

Abstract: We introduce Universal and Transferable Adversarial Perturbations (UTAP) for
pathology foundation models that reveal critical vulnerabilities in their
capabilities. Optimized using deep learning, UTAP comprises a fixed and weak
noise pattern that, when added to a pathology image, systematically disrupts
the feature representation capabilities of multiple pathology foundation
models. Therefore, UTAP induces performance drops in downstream tasks that
utilize foundation models, including misclassification across a wide range of
unseen data distributions. In addition to compromising the model performance,
we demonstrate two key features of UTAP: (1) universality: its perturbation can
be applied across diverse field-of-views independent of the dataset that UTAP
was developed on, and (2) transferability: its perturbation can successfully
degrade the performance of various external, black-box pathology foundation
models - never seen before. These two features indicate that UTAP is not a
dedicated attack associated with a specific foundation model or image dataset,
but rather constitutes a broad threat to various emerging pathology foundation
models and their applications. We systematically evaluated UTAP across various
state-of-the-art pathology foundation models on multiple datasets, causing a
significant drop in their performance with visually imperceptible modifications
to the input images using a fixed noise pattern. The development of these
potent attacks establishes a critical, high-standard benchmark for model
robustness evaluation, highlighting a need for advancing defense mechanisms and
potentially providing the necessary assets for adversarial training to ensure
the safe and reliable deployment of AI in pathology.

Conclusion: HYDRA方法成功解决了先前光谱重建模型的关键限制，实现了高质量、高效率的光谱重建。

Abstract: Hyperspectral images (HSI) promise to support a range of new applications in
computer vision. Recent research has explored the feasibility of generalizable
Spectral Reconstruction (SR), the problem of recovering a HSI from a natural
three-channel color image in unseen scenarios.
  However, previous Multi-Scale Attention (MSA) works have only demonstrated
sufficient generalizable results for very sparse spectra, while modern HSI
sensors contain hundreds of channels.
  This paper introduces a novel approach to spectral reconstruction via our
HYbrid knowledge Distillation and spectral Reconstruction Architecture (HYDRA).
  Using a Teacher model that encapsulates latent hyperspectral image data and a
Student model that learns mappings from natural images to the Teacher's encoded
domain, alongside a novel training method, we achieve high-quality spectral
reconstruction.
  This addresses key limitations of prior SR models, providing SOTA performance
across all metrics, including an 18\% boost in accuracy, and faster inference
times than current SOTA models at various channel depths.

<details>

Motivation: 解决VLMs在空间推理中的两个核心瓶颈：基于2D预训练导致的3D理解能力不足，以及冗余3D信息引发的推理失败。

Method: 采用双代理框架：感知代理使用感知工具箱（包括新颖的SOG模块）提取充分信息，推理代理迭代精炼信息以追求最小化，形成最小充分集。

Result: 在两个具有挑战性的基准测试中显著提高了准确性，达到了最先进的性能水平。

Conclusion: 通过明确追求充分性和最小性，MSSR不仅提升了空间推理性能，还生成了可解释的推理路径，为未来模型提供了高质量训练数据。

Abstract: Spatial reasoning, the ability to ground language in 3D understanding,
remains a persistent challenge for Vision-Language Models (VLMs). We identify
two fundamental bottlenecks: inadequate 3D understanding capabilities stemming
from 2D-centric pre-training, and reasoning failures induced by redundant 3D
information. To address these, we first construct a Minimal Sufficient Set
(MSS) of information before answering a given question: a compact selection of
3D perception results from \textit{expert models}. We introduce MSSR (Minimal
Sufficient Spatial Reasoner), a dual-agent framework that implements this
principle. A Perception Agent programmatically queries 3D scenes using a
versatile perception toolbox to extract sufficient information, including a
novel SOG (Situated Orientation Grounding) module that robustly extracts
language-grounded directions. A Reasoning Agent then iteratively refines this
information to pursue minimality, pruning redundant details and requesting
missing ones in a closed loop until the MSS is curated. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that our method, by explicitly pursuing both sufficiency and
minimality, significantly improves accuracy and achieves state-of-the-art
performance across two challenging benchmarks. Furthermore, our framework
produces interpretable reasoning paths, offering a promising source of
high-quality training data for future models. Source code is available at

Result: 在IEEE SPS VIP Cup真实噪声OCT数据集上验证，通过CNR、MSR、TP、EP等指标显示性能提升

Conclusion: 该方法在仅有真实噪声图像的情况下有效提升图像质量，具有临床应用的潜力

Abstract: Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) is a widely used non-invasive imaging
technique that provides detailed three-dimensional views of the retina, which
are essential for the early and accurate diagnosis of ocular diseases.
Consequently, OCT image analysis and processing have emerged as key research
areas in biomedical imaging. However, acquiring paired datasets of clean and
real-world noisy OCT images for supervised denoising models remains a
formidable challenge due to intrinsic speckle noise and practical constraints
in clinical imaging environments. To address these issues, we propose SDPA++: A
General Framework for Self-Supervised Denoising with Patch Aggregation. Our
novel approach leverages only noisy OCT images by first generating
pseudo-ground-truth images through self-fusion and self-supervised denoising.
These refined images then serve as targets to train an ensemble of denoising
models using a patch-based strategy that effectively enhances image clarity.
Performance improvements are validated via metrics such as Contrast-to-Noise
Ratio (CNR), Mean Square Ratio (MSR), Texture Preservation (TP), and Edge
Preservation (EP) on the real-world dataset from the IEEE SPS Video and Image
Processing Cup. Notably, the VIP Cup dataset contains only real-world noisy OCT
images without clean references, highlighting our method's potential for
improving image quality and diagnostic outcomes in clinical practice.

Motivation: 在领域泛化（DG）设置中，直接应用对比学习（CL）反而会降低性能，这是因为缺乏类内连通性。本文旨在解决这一矛盾，通过增强跨域的概念连通性来获得可泛化的表示。

Method: 提出DCCL方法：在数据层面使用更激进的数据增强和跨域正样本；在模型层面提出模型锚定技术，利用预训练表示中的类内连通性，并通过生成变换损失进行补充。

Result: 在五个标准DG基准测试上进行了广泛实验，结果表明DCCL即使在没有领域监督的情况下也优于最先进的基线方法。

Conclusion: DCCL通过增强跨域的概念连通性，成功解决了对比学习在领域泛化中的性能下降问题，为领域泛化提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Distribution shifts between training and testing samples frequently occur in
practice and impede model generalization performance. This crucial challenge
thereby motivates studies on domain generalization (DG), which aim to predict
the label on unseen target domain data by solely using data from source
domains. It is intuitive to conceive the class-separated representations
learned in contrastive learning (CL) are able to improve DG, while the reality
is quite the opposite: users observe directly applying CL deteriorates the
performance. We analyze the phenomenon with the insights from CL theory and
discover lack of intra-class connectivity in the DG setting causes the
deficiency. We thus propose a new paradigm, domain-connecting contrastive
learning (DCCL), to enhance the conceptual connectivity across domains and
obtain generalizable representations for DG. On the data side, more aggressive
data augmentation and cross-domain positive samples are introduced to improve
intra-class connectivity. On the model side, to better embed the unseen test
domains, we propose model anchoring to exploit the intra-class connectivity in
pre-trained representations and complement the anchoring with generative
transformation loss. Extensive experiments on five standard DG benchmarks are
performed. The results verify that DCCL outperforms state-of-the-art baselines
even without domain supervision. The detailed model implementation and the code
are provided through https://github.com/weitianxin/DCCL

Abstract: We present HumanCM, a one-step human motion prediction framework built upon
consistency models. Instead of relying on multi-step denoising as in
diffusion-based methods, HumanCM performs efficient single-step generation by
learning a self-consistent mapping between noisy and clean motion states. The
framework adopts a Transformer-based spatiotemporal architecture with temporal
embeddings to model long-range dependencies and preserve motion coherence.
Experiments on Human3.6M and HumanEva-I demonstrate that HumanCM achieves
comparable or superior accuracy to state-of-the-art diffusion models while
reducing inference steps by up to two orders of magnitude.

Abstract: Existing research on 3D Large Language Models (LLMs) still struggles to
achieve grounded question-answering, primarily due to the under-exploration of
the mech- anism of human-like scene-object grounded reasoning. This paper
bridges the gap by presenting a novel framework. We first introduce a grounded
Chain-of- Thought reasoning method in 3D scenes (SCENECOT), decoupling a
complex reasoning task into simpler and manageable problems, and building
corresponding visual clues based on multimodal expert modules. To enable such a
method, we develop SCENECOT-185K, the first large-scale grounded CoT reasoning
dataset, consisting of 185K high-quality instances. Extensive experiments
across various complex 3D scene reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that our new
framework achieves strong performance with high grounding-QA coherence. To the
best of our knowledge, this is the first successful application of CoT
reasoning to 3D scene understanding, enabling step-by-step human-like reasoning
and showing potential for extension to broader 3D scene understanding
scenarios.

Result: 在nuScenes基准测试中，IR-WM在4D占用预测和轨迹规划方面实现了顶级性能。

Conclusion: 隐式残差世界模型通过专注于建模变化而非完全重建，显著提高了自动驾驶系统的效率和规划精度。

Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving systems increasingly rely on vision-centric
world models to understand and predict their environment. However, a common
ineffectiveness in these models is the full reconstruction of future scenes,
which expends significant capacity on redundantly modeling static backgrounds.
To address this, we propose IR-WM, an Implicit Residual World Model that
focuses on modeling the current state and evolution of the world. IR-WM first
establishes a robust bird's-eye-view representation of the current state from
the visual observation. It then leverages the BEV features from the previous
timestep as a strong temporal prior and predicts only the "residual", i.e., the
changes conditioned on the ego-vehicle's actions and scene context. To
alleviate error accumulation over time, we further apply an alignment module to
calibrate semantic and dynamic misalignments. Moreover, we investigate
different forecasting-planning coupling schemes and demonstrate that the
implicit future state generated by world models substantially improves planning
accuracy. On the nuScenes benchmark, IR-WM achieves top performance in both 4D
occupancy forecasting and trajectory planning.

TL;DR: UKANFormer是一种新颖的语义分割模型，能够在来自Allen Coral Atlas的噪声监督下实现高精度珊瑚礁映射，通过架构设计缓解标签噪声问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全球珊瑚礁产品如Allen Coral Atlas在空间精度和语义一致性方面存在局限，特别是在需要精细边界描绘的区域。需要解决在噪声监督下实现高精度映射的挑战。

Method: 基于UKAN架构，在解码器中加入全局-局部变换器（GL-Trans）模块，能够同时提取全局语义结构和局部边界细节。

Result: UKANFormer在珊瑚类IoU达到67.00%，像素精度达到83.98%，在相同噪声标签设置下优于传统基线方法。模型产生的预测在视觉和结构上比训练使用的噪声标签更准确。

Conclusion: 架构设计可以缓解标签噪声，支持在非完美监督下进行可扩展映射，为生态监测提供了基础，特别是在可靠标签稀缺的情况下。

Abstract: Coral reefs are vital yet fragile ecosystems that require accurate
large-scale mapping for effective conservation. Although global products such
as the Allen Coral Atlas provide unprecedented coverage of global coral reef
distri-bution, their predictions are frequently limited in spatial precision
and semantic consistency, especially in regions requiring fine-grained boundary
delineation. To address these challenges, we propose UKANFormer, a novel
se-mantic segmentation model designed to achieve high-precision mapping under
noisy supervision derived from Allen Coral Atlas. Building upon the UKAN
architecture, UKANFormer incorporates a Global-Local Transformer (GL-Trans)
block in the decoder, enabling the extraction of both global semantic
structures and local boundary details. In experiments, UKANFormer achieved a
coral-class IoU of 67.00% and pixel accuracy of 83.98%, outperforming
conventional baselines under the same noisy labels setting. Remarkably, the
model produces predictions that are visually and structurally more accurate
than the noisy labels used for training. These results challenge the notion
that data quality directly limits model performance, showing that architectural
design can mitigate label noise and sup-port scalable mapping under imperfect
supervision. UKANFormer provides a foundation for ecological monitoring where
reliable labels are scarce.

Abstract: Embodied AI requires agents that perceive, act, and anticipate how actions
reshape future world states. World models serve as internal simulators that
capture environment dynamics, enabling forward and counterfactual rollouts to
support perception, prediction, and decision making. This survey presents a
unified framework for world models in embodied AI. Specifically, we formalize
the problem setting and learning objectives, and propose a three-axis taxonomy
encompassing: (1) Functionality, Decision-Coupled vs. General-Purpose; (2)
Temporal Modeling, Sequential Simulation and Inference vs. Global Difference
Prediction; (3) Spatial Representation, Global Latent Vector, Token Feature
Sequence, Spatial Latent Grid, and Decomposed Rendering Representation. We
systematize data resources and metrics across robotics, autonomous driving, and
general video settings, covering pixel prediction quality, state-level
understanding, and task performance. Furthermore, we offer a quantitative
comparison of state-of-the-art models and distill key open challenges,
including the scarcity of unified datasets and the need for evaluation metrics
that assess physical consistency over pixel fidelity, the trade-off between
model performance and the computational efficiency required for real-time
control, and the core modeling difficulty of achieving long-horizon temporal
consistency while mitigating error accumulation. Finally, we maintain a curated

TL;DR: 研究表明，离散的自回归视觉模型比连续扩散模型更适合推理时搜索优化，2B参数的自回归模型通过beam搜索能超越12B参数扩散模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然推理时搜索在语言模型中取得成功，但在图像生成领域应用有限，特别是连续扩散模型难以从搜索中获益。

Method: 采用离散的自回归视觉模型，利用beam搜索进行推理时优化，利用离散token空间的优势实现早期剪枝和计算重用。

Result: 2B参数的自回归模型通过beam搜索在文本到图像生成任务中超越了12B参数的扩散模型，验证了离散架构对推理时优化的优势。

Conclusion: 模型架构（而非仅规模）对视觉生成中的推理时优化至关重要，离散自回归模型比连续扩散模型更适合搜索策略。

Abstract: While inference-time scaling through search has revolutionized Large Language
Models, translating these gains to image generation has proven difficult.
Recent attempts to apply search strategies to continuous diffusion models show
limited benefits, with simple random sampling often performing best. We
demonstrate that the discrete, sequential nature of visual autoregressive
models enables effective search for image generation. We show that beam search
substantially improves text-to-image generation, enabling a 2B parameter
autoregressive model to outperform a 12B parameter diffusion model across
benchmarks. Systematic ablations show that this advantage comes from the
discrete token space, which allows early pruning and computational reuse, and
our verifier analysis highlights trade-offs between speed and reasoning
capability. These findings suggest that model architecture, not just scale, is
critical for inference-time optimization in visual generation.

Motivation: 随着生成式图像超分辨率模型能力的增强，它们产生伪影的趋势也在增加。这些伪影对人类感知的影响各不相同，应该根据其显著性而非统一处理为二元缺陷。

Method: 构建了包含1302个来自11种当代图像SR方法的伪影示例数据集，每个伪影都配有众包显著性评分。基于此数据集训练了一个轻量级回归器来生成空间显著性热图。

Result: 训练的回归器在检测显著伪影方面优于现有方法，能够准确识别对人类观察者影响较大的伪影。

Conclusion: 该方法为SR伪影的显著性感知评估和缓解提供了有效工具，释放的数据集和代码将促进相关研究。

Abstract: Generative image super-resolution (SR) is rapidly advancing in visual quality
and detail restoration. As the capacity of SR models expands, however, so does
their tendency to produce artifacts: incorrect, visually disturbing details
that reduce perceived quality. Crucially, their perceptual impact varies: some
artifacts are barely noticeable while others strongly degrade the image. We
argue that artifacts should be characterized by their prominence to human
observers rather than treated as uniform binary defects. Motivated by this, we
present a novel dataset of 1302 artifact examples from 11 contemporary image-SR
methods, where each artifact is paired with a crowdsourced prominence score.
Building on this dataset, we train a lightweight regressor that produces
spatial prominence heatmaps and outperforms existing methods at detecting
prominent artifacts. We release the dataset and code to facilitate
prominence-aware evaluation and mitigation of SR artifacts.

Motivation: 传统CNN方法在图像修复中受限于小感受野和缺乏通道特征建模，难以充分恢复精细纹理细节。

Method: 提出全局多尺度小波变换卷积(GMWTConvs)扩大感受野，Mamba通道感知模块(MCAM)捕获通道间长程依赖，以及多尺度纹理增强损失(MTELoss)指导纹理结构保留。

Result: 实验表明WaMaIR在图像修复任务中优于现有最优方法，同时保持了高效的计算性能。

Conclusion: WaMaIR通过结合大感受野特征提取、通道感知建模和纹理增强损失，有效解决了图像修复中的纹理细节恢复问题。

Abstract: Image restoration is a fundamental and challenging task in computer vision,
where CNN-based frameworks demonstrate significant computational efficiency.
However, previous CNN-based methods often face challenges in adequately
restoring fine texture details, which are limited by the small receptive field
of CNN structures and the lack of channel feature modeling. In this paper, we
propose WaMaIR, which is a novel framework with a large receptive field for
image perception and improves the reconstruction of texture details in restored
images. Specifically, we introduce the Global Multiscale Wavelet Transform
Convolutions (GMWTConvs) for expandding the receptive field to extract image
features, preserving and enriching texture features in model inputs. Meanwhile,
we propose the Mamba-Based Channel-Aware Module (MCAM), explicitly designed to
capture long-range dependencies within feature channels, which enhancing the
model sensitivity to color, edges, and texture information. Additionally, we
propose Multiscale Texture Enhancement Loss (MTELoss) for image restoration to
guide the model in preserving detailed texture structures effectively.
Extensive experiments confirm that WaMaIR outperforms state-of-the-art methods,
achieving better image restoration and efficient computational performance of
the model.

Motivation: 现有方法孤立处理图像区域，仅依赖局部线索，导致编辑不一致、过渡不自然或整体连贯性丧失

Method: 引入双级引导机制：区域在完整图像上下文中表示并与详细区域级描述对齐，同时整个图像与视觉语言模型生成的场景级描述匹配

Result: 实验表明该方法能产生更连贯且与指令对齐的结果

Conclusion: 该方法通过全局上下文理解实现精确协调的图像编辑

Abstract: Recent research has made significant progress in localizing and editing image
regions based on text. However, most approaches treat these regions in
isolation, relying solely on local cues without accounting for how each part
contributes to the overall visual and semantic composition. This often results
in inconsistent edits, unnatural transitions, or loss of coherence across the
image. In this work, we propose Region in Context, a novel framework for
text-conditioned image editing that performs multilevel semantic alignment
between vision and language, inspired by the human ability to reason about
edits in relation to the whole scene. Our method encourages each region to
understand its role within the global image context, enabling precise and
harmonized changes. At its core, the framework introduces a dual-level guidance
mechanism: regions are represented with full-image context and aligned with
detailed region-level descriptions, while the entire image is simultaneously
matched to a comprehensive scene-level description generated by a large
vision-language model. These descriptions serve as explicit verbal references
of the intended content, guiding both local modifications and global structure.
Experiments show that it produces more coherent and instruction-aligned
results. Code is available at:

TL;DR: 提出了EMRRG框架，基于预训练的Mamba网络，使用参数高效方法微调，用于X射线医疗报告生成，在多个基准数据集上取得优异表现。


<details>

Motivation: 现有医疗报告生成模型主要依赖大语言模型，对预训练视觉基础模型和先进微调技术探索有限，主流框架要么避免微调要么使用简单方法如LoRA，忽视了增强跨注意力机制的潜力。同时，非Transformer架构如Mamba网络在医疗报告生成中尚未充分探索。

Method: 将X射线图像分割为补丁并标记化，通过SSM基础的视觉骨干网络进行特征提取，使用Partial LoRA获得最佳性能。采用混合解码器的LLM生成医疗报告，实现端到端训练。

Result: 在三个广泛使用的基准数据集上的大量实验充分验证了所提出策略对X射线医疗报告生成的有效性。

Conclusion: EMRRG框架通过微调预训练的Mamba网络，使用参数高效方法，在X射线医疗报告生成任务中取得了显著成果，为未来研究提供了有前景的方向。

Abstract: X-ray image-based medical report generation (MRG) is a pivotal area in
artificial intelligence that can significantly reduce diagnostic burdens for
clinicians and patient wait times. Existing MRG models predominantly rely on
Large Language Models (LLMs) to improve report generation, with limited
exploration of pre-trained vision foundation models or advanced fine-tuning
techniques. Mainstream frameworks either avoid fine-tuning or utilize
simplistic methods like LoRA, often neglecting the potential of enhancing
cross-attention mechanisms. Additionally, while Transformer-based models
dominate vision-language tasks, non-Transformer architectures, such as the
Mamba network, remain underexplored for medical report generation, presenting a
promising avenue for future research. In this paper, we propose EMRRG, a novel
X-ray report generation framework that fine-tunes pre-trained Mamba networks
using parameter-efficient methods. Specifically, X-ray images are divided into
patches, tokenized, and processed by an SSM-based vision backbone for feature
extraction, with Partial LoRA yielding optimal performance. An LLM with a
hybrid decoder generates the medical report, enabling end-to-end training and
achieving strong results on benchmark datasets. Extensive experiments on three
widely used benchmark datasets fully validated the effectiveness of our
proposed strategies for the X-ray MRG. The source code of this paper will be
released on https://github.com/Event-AHU/Medical_Image_Analysis.

Motivation: 现有的6D姿态估计方法通过建立2D图像特征与3D模型特征之间的对应关系来预测姿态，但在处理纹理缺失物体和变化光照条件时面临困难。

Method: 提出GS2POSE方法，基于束调整原理设计姿态回归算法，利用李代数扩展3DGS能力构建姿态可微渲染管道，通过比较输入图像与渲染图像迭代优化姿态，并更新3DGS模型中的颜色参数以适应光照变化。

Result: 在T-LESS、LineMod-Occlusion和LineMod数据集上，相比先前模型分别实现了1.4%、2.8%和2.5%的准确率提升。

Conclusion: GS2POSE通过结合3D高斯散射和束调整原理，有效解决了纹理缺失物体和变化光照条件下的6D姿态估计问题，在多个基准数据集上取得了显著的性能提升。

Abstract: Accurate 6D pose estimation of 3D objects is a fundamental task in computer
vision, and current research typically predicts the 6D pose by establishing
correspondences between 2D image features and 3D model features. However, these
methods often face difficulties with textureless objects and varying
illumination conditions. To overcome these limitations, we propose GS2POSE, a
novel approach for 6D object pose estimation. GS2POSE formulates a pose
regression algorithm inspired by the principles of Bundle Adjustment (BA). By
leveraging Lie algebra, we extend the capabilities of 3DGS to develop a
pose-differentiable rendering pipeline, which iteratively optimizes the pose by
comparing the input image to the rendered image. Additionally, GS2POSE updates
color parameters within the 3DGS model, enhancing its adaptability to changes
in illumination. Compared to previous models, GS2POSE demonstrates accuracy
improvements of 1.4\%, 2.8\% and 2.5\% on the T-LESS, LineMod-Occlusion and
LineMod datasets, respectively.

Motivation: 现有视频理解模型依赖大量标注数据进行任务特定训练，成本高且可扩展性有限。本文旨在将大规模视觉语言模型的零样本推理能力有效迁移到视频领域。

Method: 使用预训练VLM的冻结视觉编码器将视频转换为语义特征轨迹，然后应用核时间分割(KTS)将连续特征流分割为语义连贯的事件段，最后通过无监督密度聚类识别重复出现的宏观场景和主题。

Result: 该框架能够自动生成结构化的多模态视频内容摘要，通过从每个发现的聚类中选择代表性关键帧并利用VLM的文本生成能力进行描述。

Conclusion: 该方法为零样本、自动化的视频内容结构分析提供了一条有效、可解释且模型无关的途径。

Abstract: The remarkable zero-shot reasoning capabilities of large-scale Visual
Language Models (VLMs) on static images have yet to be fully translated to the
video domain. Conventional video understanding models often rely on extensive,
task-specific training on annotated datasets, a process that is both costly and
limited in scalability. This paper introduces a novel, training-free framework
for video understanding that circumvents end-to-end training by synergistically
combining the rich semantic priors of pre-trained VLMs with classic machine
learning algorithms for pattern discovery. Our core idea is to reframe video
understanding as a self-supervised spatio-temporal clustering problem within a
high-dimensional semantic feature space. The proposed pipeline first transforms
a video stream into a semantic feature trajectory using the frozen visual
encoder of a pre-trained VLM. Subsequently, we employ Kernel Temporal
Segmentation (KTS), a robust machine learning technique, to partition the
continuous feature stream into discrete, semantically coherent event segments.
These segments are then subjected to unsupervised density-based clustering to
identify recurring macroscopic scenes and themes throughout the video. By
selecting representative keyframes from each discovered cluster and leveraging
the VLM's generative capabilities for textual description, our framework
automatically produces a structured, multi-modal summary of the video content.
This approach provides an effective, interpretable, and model-agnostic pathway
for zero-shot, automated structural analysis of video content.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法需要微调模型以产生与掩码解码器兼容的特定输出，这会改变模型的输出空间并损害其内在泛化能力，违背了构建统一模型的目标。

Method: LENS在完全冻结的MLLM上附加轻量级可训练头部，通过细化注意力图中嵌入的空间线索来提取关键点，并将其描述为与掩码解码器直接兼容的点状特征。

Result: LENS实现了与基于重新训练方法相当或更优的分割性能，同时完全保留了MLLM的泛化能力，而微调方法会显著降低这种能力。

Conclusion: LENS的可附加设计为扩展MLLM建立了一个高效且强大的范式，为真正多才多艺的统一模型铺平了道路。

Abstract: Integrating diverse visual capabilities into a unified model is a significant
trend in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Among these, the inclusion
of segmentation poses a distinct set of challenges. To equip MLLMs with
pixel-level segmentation abilities, prevailing methods require finetuning the
model to produce specific outputs compatible with a mask decoder. This process
typically alters the model's output space and compromises its intrinsic
generalization, which undermines the goal of building a unified model. We
introduce LENS (Leveraging kEypoiNts for MLLMs' Segmentation), a novel
plug-and-play solution. LENS attaches a lightweight, trainable head to a
completely frozen MLLM. By refining the spatial cues embedded in attention
maps, LENS extracts keypoints and describes them into point-wise features
directly compatible with the mask decoder. Extensive experiments validate our
approach: LENS achieves segmentation performance competitive with or superior
to that of retraining-based methods. Crucially, it does so while fully
preserving the MLLM's generalization capabilities, which are significantly
degraded by finetuning approaches. As such, the attachable design of LENS
establishes an efficient and powerful paradigm for extending MLLMs, paving the
way for truly multi-talented, unified models.

Motivation: 消除对昂贵手动标注数据集的依赖，为自动驾驶提供可扩展的无监督道路分割解决方案。

Method: 使用几何先验生成弱标签（地平线上方为非道路，车辆前方四边形为道路），然后通过跨帧跟踪局部特征点并利用互信息最大化来强制时间一致性。

Result: 在Cityscapes数据集上实现了0.82的交并比(IoU)，表现出高精度和良好的时间稳定性。

Conclusion: 结合几何约束和时间一致性的方法在无监督道路分割中具有巨大潜力，为自动驾驶提供了简单而有效的解决方案。

Abstract: This paper presents a fully unsupervised approach for binary road
segmentation (road vs. non-road), eliminating the reliance on costly manually
labeled datasets. The method leverages scene geometry and temporal cues to
distinguish road from non-road regions. Weak labels are first generated from
geometric priors, marking pixels above the horizon as non-road and a predefined
quadrilateral in front of the vehicle as road. In a refinement stage, temporal
consistency is enforced by tracking local feature points across frames and
penalizing inconsistent label assignments using mutual information
maximization. This enhances both precision and temporal stability. On the
Cityscapes dataset, the model achieves an Intersection-over-Union (IoU) of
0.82, demonstrating high accuracy with a simple design. These findings
demonstrate the potential of combining geometric constraints and temporal
consistency for scalable unsupervised road segmentation in autonomous driving.

Motivation: 现有方法要么无法从参考图像中学习有意义的摄影概念，要么无法保持内容图像的内容。摄影风格作为摄影概念的组合，是著名摄影师魅力的来源。

Method: 基于预训练文本到图像扩散模型，使用文本反转技术优化摄影概念的提示词，学习参考图像的摄影风格。

Result: PIF在提取和转移各种摄影风格方面表现出色。

Conclusion: PIF能够有效学习和转移摄影风格，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Photographic style, as a composition of certain photographic concepts, is the
charm behind renowned photographers. But learning and transferring photographic
style need a profound understanding of how the photo is edited from the unknown
original appearance. Previous works either fail to learn meaningful
photographic concepts from reference images, or cannot preserve the content of
the content image. To tackle these issues, we proposed a Personalized Image
Filter (PIF). Based on a pretrained text-to-image diffusion model, the
generative prior enables PIF to learn the average appearance of photographic
concepts, as well as how to adjust them according to text prompts. PIF then
learns the photographic style of reference images with the textual inversion
technique, by optimizing the prompts for the photographic concepts. PIF shows
outstanding performance in extracting and transferring various kinds of
photographic style. Project page: https://pif.pages.dev/

encompasses three different ripeness stages and contains 11,414 images,
consisting of 878 raw RGB images, 8,780 augmented RGB images, and 1,756 depth

Method: 整合了76个CoralNet来源和红海Al Wajh站点的图像，提供细粒度、分类学映射的标注。提出两种评估设置：源内基准和跨源基准，测试领域泛化能力。

Result: 监督学习在源内表现良好，但在跨域时性能急剧下降；零样本模型整体表现较差，特别是对于稀有和视觉相似属类。

Conclusion: ReefNet为领域泛化和细粒度珊瑚分类提供了具有挑战性的基准，将促进稳健、领域自适应的全球珊瑚礁监测和保护研究。

Abstract: Coral reefs are rapidly declining due to anthropogenic pressures such as
climate change, underscoring the urgent need for scalable, automated
monitoring. We introduce ReefNet, a large public coral reef image dataset with
point-label annotations mapped to the World Register of Marine Species (WoRMS).
ReefNet aggregates imagery from 76 curated CoralNet sources and an additional
site from Al Wajh in the Red Sea, totaling approximately 925000 genus-level
hard coral annotations with expert-verified labels. Unlike prior datasets,
which are often limited by size, geography, or coarse labels and are not
ML-ready, ReefNet offers fine-grained, taxonomically mapped labels at a global
scale to WoRMS. We propose two evaluation settings: (i) a within-source
benchmark that partitions each source's images for localized evaluation, and
(ii) a cross-source benchmark that withholds entire sources to test domain
generalization. We analyze both supervised and zero-shot classification
performance on ReefNet and find that while supervised within-source performance
is promising, supervised performance drops sharply across domains, and
performance is low across the board for zero-shot models, especially for rare
and visually similar genera. This provides a challenging benchmark intended to
catalyze advances in domain generalization and fine-grained coral
classification. We will release our dataset, benchmarking code, and pretrained
models to advance robust, domain-adaptive, global coral reef monitoring and
conservation.

TL;DR: 提出AdaptMoist域适应方法，利用纹理特征预测木屑水分含量，解决不同来源木屑数据分布变化问题，准确率提升23%达到80%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有直接方法（烘箱干燥）处理时间长且破坏样本，间接方法在不同来源木屑上准确性不足，需要解决数据分布变化对数据驱动模型性能的影响。

Method: 分析五种纹理特征类型，提出AdaptMoist域适应方法，利用纹理特征将知识从一个木屑数据源转移到另一个，并基于调整互信息提出模型保存标准。

Result: 组合五种纹理特征准确率达95%；AdaptMoist方法使跨域预测准确率从57%提升至80%，提高23%。

Conclusion: AdaptMoist是跨域木屑水分含量估计的有效解决方案，对依赖木屑的行业具有应用潜力。

Abstract: Accurate and quick prediction of wood chip moisture content is critical for
optimizing biofuel production and ensuring energy efficiency. The current
widely used direct method (oven drying) is limited by its longer processing
time and sample destructiveness. On the other hand, existing indirect methods,
including near-infrared spectroscopy-based, electrical capacitance-based, and
image-based approaches, are quick but not accurate when wood chips come from
various sources. Variability in the source material can alter data
distributions, undermining the performance of data-driven models. Therefore,
there is a need for a robust approach that effectively mitigates the impact of
source variability. Previous studies show that manually extracted texture
features have the potential to predict wood chip moisture class. Building on
this, in this study, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of five distinct
texture feature types extracted from wood chip images to predict moisture
content. Our findings reveal that a combined feature set incorporating all five
texture features achieves an accuracy of 95% and consistently outperforms
individual texture features in predicting moisture content. To ensure robust
moisture prediction, we propose a domain adaptation method named AdaptMoist
that utilizes the texture features to transfer knowledge from one source of
wood chip data to another, addressing variability across different domains. We
also proposed a criterion for model saving based on adjusted mutual
information. The AdaptMoist method improves prediction accuracy across domains
by 23%, achieving an average accuracy of 80%, compared to 57% for non-adapted
models. These results highlight the effectiveness of AdaptMoist as a robust
solution for wood chip moisture content estimation across domains, making it a
potential solution for wood chip-reliant industries.

TL;DR: 提出M2HVideo框架，将假人模特视频转换为身份可控、逼真的人体视频，解决头部与身体运动不对齐和身份漂移问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 假人模特展示服装成本低但缺乏真实感和表现细节，需要将假人视频转换为逼真的人体视频。

Method: 使用动态姿态感知头部编码器融合面部语义和身体姿态，引入镜像损失和分布感知适配器增强时间一致性。

Result: 在多个数据集上实验表明，M2HVideo在服装一致性、身份保持和视频保真度方面优于现有方法。

Conclusion: M2HVideo框架有效解决了假人到人体视频生成的关键挑战，实现了高质量的逼真视频生成。

Abstract: Mannequin-based clothing displays offer a cost-effective alternative to
real-model showcases for online fashion presentation, but lack realism and
expressive detail. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a new task called
mannequin-to-human (M2H) video generation, which aims to synthesize
identity-controllable, photorealistic human videos from footage of mannequins.
We propose M2HVideo, a pose-aware and identity-preserving video generation
framework that addresses two key challenges: the misalignment between head and
body motion, and identity drift caused by temporal modeling. In particular,
M2HVideo incorporates a dynamic pose-aware head encoder that fuses facial
semantics with body pose to produce consistent identity embeddings across
frames. To address the loss of fine facial details due to latent space
compression, we introduce a mirror loss applied in pixel space through a
denoising diffusion implicit model (DDIM)-based one-step denoising.
Additionally, we design a distribution-aware adapter that aligns statistical
distributions of identity and clothing features to enhance temporal coherence.
Extensive experiments on the UBC fashion dataset, our self-constructed ASOS
dataset, and the newly collected MannequinVideos dataset captured on-site
demonstrate that M2HVideo achieves superior performance in terms of clothing
consistency, identity preservation, and video fidelity in comparison to
state-of-the-art methods.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 2DGS-R是一种改进的2D高斯泼溅方法，通过分层训练策略在保持几何精度的同时提升渲染质量，仅增加1%存储开销和少量训练时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D高斯泼溅(3DGS)在渲染质量方面表现出色但难以准确表示表面，而2DGS虽然几何保真度更高但渲染质量受损，现有方法无法在单阶段训练中同时优化几何和渲染质量。

Method: 采用分层训练方法：首先用法向一致性正则化训练原始2D高斯；然后选择渲染质量不足的2D高斯进行原位克隆操作；最后冻结不透明度进行微调。

Result: 相比原始2DGS，仅增加1%存储和少量训练时间，实现了高质量渲染结果同时保持精细几何结构，在视觉保真度和几何重建精度方面均有提升。

Conclusion: 该方法有效平衡了效率与性能，证明了通过分层训练策略可以同时实现高质量渲染和精确几何结构，解决了现有方法的局限性。

Abstract: Recent advancements in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have greatly influenced
neural fields, as it enables high-fidelity rendering with impressive visual
quality. However, 3DGS has difficulty accurately representing surfaces. In
contrast, 2DGS transforms the 3D volume into a collection of 2D planar Gaussian
disks. Despite advancements in geometric fidelity, rendering quality remains
compromised, highlighting the challenge of achieving both high-quality
rendering and precise geometric structures. This indicates that optimizing both
geometric and rendering quality in a single training stage is currently
unfeasible. To overcome this limitation, we present 2DGS-R, a new method that
uses a hierarchical training approach to improve rendering quality while
maintaining geometric accuracy. 2DGS-R first trains the original 2D Gaussians
with the normal consistency regularization. Then 2DGS-R selects the 2D
Gaussians with inadequate rendering quality and applies a novel in-place
cloning operation to enhance the 2D Gaussians. Finally, we fine-tune the 2DGS-R
model with opacity frozen. Experimental results show that compared to the
original 2DGS, our method requires only 1\% more storage and minimal additional
training time. Despite this negligible overhead, it achieves high-quality
rendering results while preserving fine geometric structures. These findings
indicate that our approach effectively balances efficiency with performance,
leading to improvements in both visual fidelity and geometric reconstruction
accuracy.

Conclusion: ArmFormer是部署在便携安全摄像头、监控无人机和嵌入式AI加速器上的最优解决方案，在分布式安全基础设施中具有重要应用价值。

Abstract: The escalating threat of weapon-related violence necessitates automated
detection systems capable of pixel-level precision for accurate threat
assessment in real-time security applications. Traditional weapon detection
approaches rely on object detection frameworks that provide only coarse
bounding box localizations, lacking the fine-grained segmentation required for
comprehensive threat analysis. Furthermore, existing semantic segmentation
models either sacrifice accuracy for computational efficiency or require
excessive computational resources incompatible with edge deployment scenarios.
This paper presents ArmFormer, a lightweight transformer-based semantic
segmentation framework that strategically integrates Convolutional Block
Attention Module (CBAM) with MixVisionTransformer architecture to achieve
superior accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency suitable for
resource-constrained edge devices. Our approach combines CBAM-enhanced encoder
backbone with attention-integrated hamburger decoder to enable multi-class
weapon segmentation across five categories: handgun, rifle, knife, revolver,
and human. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that ArmFormer achieves
state-of-the-art performance with 80.64% mIoU and 89.13% mFscore while
maintaining real-time inference at 82.26 FPS. With only 4.886G FLOPs and 3.66M
parameters, ArmFormer outperforms heavyweight models requiring up to 48x more
computation, establishing it as the optimal solution for deployment on portable
security cameras, surveillance drones, and embedded AI accelerators in
distributed security infrastructure.

*Shujian Gao,Yuan Wang,Zekuan Yu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: BARL是一个半监督医学图像分割框架，通过在表示空间和标签空间同时进行双边对齐，显著提升了分割性能并减少了标注成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有半监督医学图像分割方法主要依赖标签空间一致性，但忽视了表示空间对齐的重要性，导致模型难以学习到既具有判别性又具有空间一致性的表示。

Method: 提出BARL框架，包含两个协作分支：标签空间对齐采用双路径正则化和渐进认知偏差校正；表示空间对齐通过区域级和病灶实例级匹配来捕捉医学图像中碎片化的复杂病理模式。

Result: 在四个公共基准数据集和一个私有CBCT数据集上的实验表明，BARL持续超越最先进的半监督医学图像分割方法。消融研究进一步验证了各组件的贡献。

Conclusion: BARL通过双边对齐策略有效提升了半监督医学图像分割的性能，证明了表示空间和标签空间协同对齐的重要性。

Abstract: Semi-supervised medical image segmentation (SSMIS) seeks to match fully
supervised performance while sharply reducing annotation cost. Mainstream SSMIS
methods rely on \emph{label-space consistency}, yet they overlook the equally
critical \emph{representation-space alignment}. Without harmonizing latent
features, models struggle to learn representations that are both discriminative
and spatially coherent. To this end, we introduce \textbf{Bilateral Alignment
in Representation and Label spaces (BARL)}, a unified framework that couples
two collaborative branches and enforces alignment in both spaces. For
label-space alignment, inspired by co-training and multi-scale decoding, we
devise \textbf{Dual-Path Regularization (DPR)} and \textbf{Progressively
Cognitive Bias Correction (PCBC)} to impose fine-grained cross-branch
consistency while mitigating error accumulation from coarse to fine scales. For
representation-space alignment, we conduct region-level and lesion-instance
matching between branches, explicitly capturing the fragmented, complex
pathological patterns common in medical imagery. Extensive experiments on four
public benchmarks and a proprietary CBCT dataset demonstrate that BARL
consistently surpasses state-of-the-art SSMIS methods. Ablative studies further
validate the contribution of each component. Code will be released soon.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于内存库的3D异常检测方法存在特征变换不一致和判别能力有限的问题，特别是在捕捉局部几何细节和实现旋转不变性方面。当配准失败时，这些问题会导致不可靠的检测结果。

Method: 提出配准诱导的旋转不变特征提取框架，将点云配准与异常检测目标集成。通过将特征提取嵌入到配准学习过程中，联合优化对齐和表示学习，获得对旋转鲁棒且对异常检测有效的特征。

Result: 在Anomaly-ShapeNet和Real3D-AD数据集上的大量实验表明，该方法在有效性和泛化性方面持续优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 点云配准不仅在几何结构对齐中起关键作用，还能指导特征提取获得旋转不变和局部判别表示。通过配准与异常检测的联合优化，可以获得更鲁棒和有效的异常检测性能。

Abstract: 3D anomaly detection in point-cloud data is critical for industrial quality
control, aiming to identify structural defects with high reliability. However,
current memory bank-based methods often suffer from inconsistent feature
transformations and limited discriminative capacity, particularly in capturing
local geometric details and achieving rotation invariance. These limitations
become more pronounced when registration fails, leading to unreliable detection
results. We argue that point-cloud registration plays an essential role not
only in aligning geometric structures but also in guiding feature extraction
toward rotation-invariant and locally discriminative representations. To this
end, we propose a registration-induced, rotation-invariant feature extraction
framework that integrates the objectives of point-cloud registration and
memory-based anomaly detection. Our key insight is that both tasks rely on
modeling local geometric structures and leveraging feature similarity across
samples. By embedding feature extraction into the registration learning
process, our framework jointly optimizes alignment and representation learning.
This integration enables the network to acquire features that are both robust
to rotations and highly effective for anomaly detection. Extensive experiments
on the Anomaly-ShapeNet and Real3D-AD datasets demonstrate that our method
consistently outperforms existing approaches in effectiveness and
generalizability.

TL;DR: 提出了一种神经元级别的分析框架，通过人类大脑活动研究视觉语言模型的多模态信息处理机制，发现人工神经元能预测生物神经元活动，揭示了VLMs中类似大脑的分层处理特性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前对人工神经网络与人类大脑处理之间相似性的理解有限：单模态ANN研究无法捕捉大脑固有的多模态处理能力，而多模态ANN研究主要关注高层模型输出，忽略了单个神经元的关键作用。

Method: 提出新颖的神经元级别分析框架，结合精细的人工神经元分析和基于fMRI的体素编码，研究了两种架构不同的视觉语言模型（CLIP和METER）。

Result: 发现四个关键结果：1) ANs能成功预测多个功能网络中BNs的活动；2) ANs和BNs都表现出功能冗余；3) ANs表现出与BNs平行的极性模式；4) CLIP和METER的架构驱动不同的BNs，CLIP显示模态特定专业化，METER产生统一跨模态激活。

Conclusion: 这些结果为视觉语言模型在神经元级别上存在类似大脑的分层处理提供了有力证据。

Abstract: While brain-inspired artificial intelligence(AI) has demonstrated promising
results, current understanding of the parallels between artificial neural
networks (ANNs) and human brain processing remains limited: (1) unimodal ANN
studies fail to capture the brain's inherent multimodal processing
capabilities, and (2) multimodal ANN research primarily focuses on high-level
model outputs, neglecting the crucial role of individual neurons. To address
these limitations, we propose a novel neuron-level analysis framework that
investigates the multimodal information processing mechanisms in
vision-language models (VLMs) through the lens of human brain activity. Our
approach uniquely combines fine-grained artificial neuron (AN) analysis with
fMRI-based voxel encoding to examine two architecturally distinct VLMs: CLIP
and METER. Our analysis reveals four key findings: (1) ANs successfully predict
biological neurons (BNs) activities across multiple functional networks
(including language, vision, attention, and default mode), demonstrating shared
representational mechanisms; (2) Both ANs and BNs demonstrate functional
redundancy through overlapping neural representations, mirroring the brain's
fault-tolerant and collaborative information processing mechanisms; (3) ANs
exhibit polarity patterns that parallel the BNs, with oppositely activated BNs
showing mirrored activation trends across VLM layers, reflecting the complexity
and bidirectional nature of neural information processing; (4) The
architectures of CLIP and METER drive distinct BNs: CLIP's independent branches
show modality-specific specialization, whereas METER's cross-modal design
yields unified cross-modal activation, highlighting the architecture's
influence on ANN brain-like properties. These results provide compelling
evidence for brain-like hierarchical processing in VLMs at the neuronal level.

Abstract: Generative models, especially Diffusion Models, have demonstrated remarkable
capability in generating high-quality synthetic data, including medical images.
However, traditional class-conditioned generative models often struggle to
generate images that accurately represent specific medical categories, limiting
their usefulness for applications such as skin cancer diagnosis. To address
this problem, we propose a classification-induced diffusion model, namely,
Class-N-Diff, to simultaneously generate and classify dermoscopic images. Our
Class-N-Diff model integrates a classifier within a diffusion model to guide
image generation based on its class conditions. Thus, the model has better
control over class-conditioned image synthesis, resulting in more realistic and
diverse images. Additionally, the classifier demonstrates improved performance,
highlighting its effectiveness for downstream diagnostic tasks. This unique
integration in our Class-N-Diff makes it a robust tool for enhancing the
quality and utility of diffusion model-based synthetic dermoscopic image
generation. Our code is available at https://github.com/Munia03/Class-N-Diff.

Abstract: Instruction-based image editing has achieved remarkable progress; however,
models solely trained via supervised fine-tuning often overfit to annotated
patterns, hindering their ability to explore and generalize beyond training
distributions. To this end, we introduce Edit-R1, a novel post-training
framework for instruction-based image editing based on policy optimization.
Specifically, we utilize Diffusion Negative-aware Finetuning (DiffusionNFT), a
likelihood-free policy optimization method consistent with the flow matching
forward process, thereby enabling the use of higher-order samplers and more
efficient training. Another key challenge here is the absence of a universal
reward model, resulting from the diverse nature of editing instructions and
tasks. To bridge this gap, we employ a Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM)
as a unified, training-free reward model, leveraging its output logits to
provide fine-grained feedback. Furthermore, we carefully design a low-variance
group filtering mechanism to reduce MLLM scoring noise and stabilize
optimization. UniWorld-V2, trained with this framework, achieves
\textbf{state-of-the-art} results on the ImgEdit and GEdit-Bench benchmarks,
scoring 4.49 and 7.83, respectively. Crucially, our framework is
model-agnostic, delivering substantial performance gains when applied to
diverse base models like Qwen-Image-Edit and FLUX-Kontext, demonstrating its
wide applicability. Code and models are publicly available at

Conclusion: 该工作为未来凝结尾迹与源航班关联研究奠定了坚实基础，提供了灵活可扩展的分析框架。

Abstract: Aviation's non-CO2 effects, particularly contrails, are a significant
contributor to its climate impact. Persistent contrails can evolve into
cirrus-like clouds that trap outgoing infrared radiation, with radiative
forcing potentially comparable to or exceeding that of aviation's CO2
emissions. While physical models simulate contrail formation, evolution and
dissipation, validating and calibrating these models requires linking observed
contrails to the flights that generated them, a process known as
contrail-to-flight attribution. Satellite-based attribution is challenging due
to limited spatial and temporal resolution, as contrails often drift and deform
before detection. In this paper, we evaluate an alternative approach using
ground-based cameras, which capture contrails shortly after formation at high
spatial and temporal resolution, when they remain thin, linear, and visually
distinct. Leveraging the ground visible camera contrail sequences (GVCCS)
dataset, we introduce a modular framework for attributing contrails observed
using ground-based cameras to theoretical contrails derived from aircraft
surveillance and meteorological data. The framework accommodates multiple
geometric representations and distance metrics, incorporates temporal
smoothing, and enables flexible probability-based assignment strategies. This
work establishes a strong baseline and provides a modular framework for future
research in linking contrails to their source flight.

Abstract: Thermal weapon segmentation is crucial for surveillance and security
applications, enabling robust detection under lowlight and visually obscured
conditions where RGB-based systems fail. While convolutional neural networks
(CNNs) dominate thermal segmentation literature, their ability to capture
long-range dependencies and fine structural details is limited. Vision
Transformers (ViTs), with their global context modeling capabilities, have
achieved state-of-the-art results in RGB segmentation tasks, yet their
potential in thermal weapon segmentation remains underexplored. This work
adapts and evaluates four transformer-based architectures SegFormer,
DeepLabV3\+, SegNeXt, and Swin Transformer for binary weapon segmentation on a
custom thermal dataset comprising 9,711 images collected from real world
surveillance videos and automatically annotated using SAM2. We employ standard
augmentation strategies within the MMSegmentation framework to ensure robust
model training and fair architectural comparison. Experimental results
demonstrate significant improvements in segmentation performance: SegFormer-b5
achieves the highest mIoU (94.15\%) and Pixel Accuracy (97.04\%), while
SegFormer-b0 provides the fastest inference speed (98.32 FPS) with competitive
mIoU (90.84\%). SegNeXt-mscans offers balanced performance with 85.12 FPS and
92.24\% mIoU, and DeepLabV3\+ R101-D8 reaches 92.76\% mIoU at 29.86 FPS. The
transformer architectures demonstrate robust generalization capabilities for
weapon detection in low-light and occluded thermal environments, with flexible
accuracy-speed trade-offs suitable for diverse real-time security applications.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) increasingly support dynamic image
resolutions. However, current evaluation paradigms primarily assess semantic
performance, overlooking the critical question of resolution robustness -
whether performance remains stable across varying input resolutions. To address
this gap, we introduce \textbf{Res-Bench}, a comprehensive benchmark comprising
14,400 samples across 12 resolution levels and six core capability dimensions.
We designed a novel evaluation framework that goes beyond traditional accuracy
metrics to capture performance stability. This framework introduces multiple
robustness metrics: Spearman's correlation for assessing resolution-performance
trends, and Absolute/Relative Continuous Error (ACE/RCE) for measuring
performance volatility. Using these metrics, we conducted a large-scale
evaluation of leading MLLMs. Our analysis encompasses: (1) model-centric and
task-centric robustness examination, (2) investigation of preprocessing
strategies including padding and super-resolution, and (3) exploration of
fine-tuning for stability enhancement.

Abstract: Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI), particularly foundation
models (FMs), have revolutionized medical image analysis, demonstrating strong
zero- and few-shot performance across diverse medical imaging tasks, from
segmentation to report generation. Unlike traditional task-specific AI models,
FMs leverage large corpora of labeled and unlabeled multimodal datasets to
learn generalized representations that can be adapted to various downstream
clinical applications with minimal fine-tuning. However, despite the rapid
proliferation of FM research in medical imaging, the field remains fragmented,
lacking a unified synthesis that systematically maps the evolution of
architectures, training paradigms, and clinical applications across modalities.
To address this gap, this review article provides a comprehensive and
structured analysis of FMs in medical image analysis. We systematically
categorize studies into vision-only and vision-language FMs based on their
architectural foundations, training strategies, and downstream clinical tasks.
Additionally, a quantitative meta-analysis of the studies was conducted to
characterize temporal trends in dataset utilization and application domains. We
also critically discuss persistent challenges, including domain adaptation,
efficient fine-tuning, computational constraints, and interpretability along
with emerging solutions such as federated learning, knowledge distillation, and
advanced prompting. Finally, we identify key future research directions aimed
at enhancing the robustness, explainability, and clinical integration of FMs,
thereby accelerating their translation into real-world medical practice.

TL;DR: 提出了Di-Bregman框架，将扩散蒸馏建模为基于Bregman散度的密度比匹配，为现有方法提供统一理论基础，并在CIFAR-10和文生图任务中实现优于反向KL蒸馏的单步生成质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散和流模型生成质量高但计算昂贵，蒸馏方法可加速但缺乏统一理论框架。

Method: 提出Di-Bregman框架，将扩散蒸馏视为Bregman散度密度比匹配问题，提供凸分析视角统一现有目标。

Result: 在CIFAR-10和文生图任务中，Di-Bregman在单步FID指标上优于反向KL蒸馏，同时保持与教师模型相近的视觉保真度。

Conclusion: Bregman密度比匹配是通向高效单步扩散生成的实际且理论可靠的方法。

Abstract: Diffusion and flow models achieve high generative quality but remain
computationally expensive due to slow multi-step sampling. Distillation methods
accelerate them by training fast student generators, yet most existing
objectives lack a unified theoretical foundation. In this work, we propose
Di-Bregman, a compact framework that formulates diffusion distillation as
Bregman divergence-based density-ratio matching. This convex-analytic view
connects several existing objectives through a common lens. Experiments on
CIFAR-10 and text-to-image generation demonstrate that Di-Bregman achieves
improved one-step FID over reverse-KL distillation and maintains high visual
fidelity compared to the teacher model. Our results highlight Bregman
density-ratio matching as a practical and theoretically-grounded route toward
efficient one-step diffusion generation.

TL;DR: 提出了CARE框架，通过序列-图像对比对齐方法解决ADL识别中序列和图像表示之间的对齐问题，在三个CASAS数据集上达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有ADL识别方法存在表示层面的限制：序列方法保持时间顺序但对噪声敏感且缺乏空间意识；图像方法捕获全局模式但压缩时间动态并扭曲传感器布局；简单的特征融合方法无法有效对齐两种表示视图。

Method: CARE框架包含：(1)时间感知、抗噪声的序列编码；(2)空间感知和频率敏感的图像表示；(3)联合对比-分类目标函数，通过序列-图像对比对齐(SICA)和交叉熵损失进行端到端学习。

Result: 在三个CASAS数据集上达到最先进性能：Milan 89.8%、Cairo 88.9%、Kyoto7 73.3%，并表现出对传感器故障和布局变化的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: CARE框架通过对比对齐有效整合了序列和图像表示的互补优势，为智能家居中可靠的ADL识别提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: The recognition of Activities of Daily Living (ADLs) from event-triggered
ambient sensors is an essential task in Ambient Assisted Living, yet existing
methods remain constrained by representation-level limitations. Sequence-based
approaches preserve temporal order of sensor activations but are sensitive to
noise and lack spatial awareness, while image-based approaches capture global
patterns and implicit spatial correlations but compress fine-grained temporal
dynamics and distort sensor layouts. Naive fusion (e.g., feature concatenation)
fail to enforce alignment between sequence- and image-based representation
views, underutilizing their complementary strengths. We propose Contrastive
Alignment for ADL Recognition from Event-Triggered Sensor Streams (CARE), an
end-to-end framework that jointly optimizes representation learning via
Sequence-Image Contrastive Alignment (SICA) and classification via
cross-entropy, ensuring both cross-representation alignment and task-specific
discriminability. CARE integrates (i) time-aware, noise-resilient sequence
encoding with (ii) spatially-informed and frequency-sensitive image
representations, and employs (iii) a joint contrastive-classification objective
for end-to-end learning of aligned and discriminative embeddings. Evaluated on
three CASAS datasets, CARE achieves state-of-the-art performance (89.8% on
Milan, 88.9% on Cairo, and 73.3% on Kyoto7) and demonstrates robustness to
sensor malfunctions and layout variability, highlighting its potential for
reliable ADL recognition in smart homes.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出BaGLM方法，利用大型多模态模型的零样本能力进行在线视频步骤定位，无需训练即可超越基于训练的离线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统视频步骤定位方法需要带标签的训练数据且需离线处理整个视频，限制了在线决策应用。本文探索如何在不训练的情况下在线执行VSG任务。

Method: 使用大型多模态模型预测有限帧的步骤，并开发BaGLM方法，通过贝叶斯滤波原则注入历史帧知识，利用大型语言模型提取的依赖矩阵和步骤进度估计来建模步骤转换。

Result: 在三个数据集上的实验表明，BaGLM在性能上优于最先进的基于训练的离线方法。

Conclusion: 利用大型多模态模型的零样本能力可以实现无需训练的在线视频步骤定位，BaGLM方法通过贝叶斯框架进一步提升了性能。

Abstract: Given a task and a set of steps composing it, Video Step Grounding (VSG) aims
to detect which steps are performed in a video. Standard approaches for this
task require a labeled training set (e.g., with step-level annotations or
narrations), which may be costly to collect. Moreover, they process the full
video offline, limiting their applications for scenarios requiring online
decisions. Thus, in this work, we explore how to perform VSG online and without
training. We achieve this by exploiting the zero-shot capabilities of recent
Large Multimodal Models (LMMs). In particular, we use LMMs to predict the step
associated with a restricted set of frames, without access to the whole video.
We show that this online strategy without task-specific tuning outperforms
offline and training-based models. Motivated by this finding, we develop
Bayesian Grounding with Large Multimodal Models (BaGLM), further injecting
knowledge of past frames into the LMM-based predictions. BaGLM exploits
Bayesian filtering principles, modeling step transitions via (i) a dependency
matrix extracted through large language models and (ii) an estimation of step
progress. Experiments on three datasets show superior performance of BaGLM over
state-of-the-art training-based offline methods.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前时序视频定位研究过于集中在少数视频表示方法上，可能导致架构过拟合。需要研究不同视频特征对模型性能的影响。

Method: 在三个基准数据集上使用基于CNN、时序推理和transformer的视频编码器提取特征，并在经典架构中比较这些特征的表现。

Result: 仅改变视频编码器就导致模型性能显著差异，同时揭示了使用某些特征时的明确模式和错误。

Conclusion: 不同视频特征之间存在性能差异和潜在互补性，这为未来研究提供了重要启示。

Abstract: Temporal video grounding is a fundamental task in computer vision, aiming to
localize a natural language query in a long, untrimmed video. It has a key role
in the scientific community, in part due to the large amount of video generated
every day. Although we find extensive work in this task, we note that research
remains focused on a small selection of video representations, which may lead
to architectural overfitting in the long run. To address this issue, we propose
an empirical study to investigate the impact of different video features on a
classical architecture. We extract features for three well-known benchmarks,
Charades-STA, ActivityNet-Captions and YouCookII, using video encoders based on
CNNs, temporal reasoning and transformers. Our results show significant
differences in the performance of our model by simply changing the video
encoder, while also revealing clear patterns and errors derived from the use of
certain features, ultimately indicating potential feature complementarity.

Motivation: 研究动机是验证遥感专用基础模型是否真的比通用视觉基础模型更有用，特别是针对遥感图像的独特特征、特定应用和鲁棒性需求。

Method: 首先设计了一个简单基准测试，测量遥感模型在低分辨率图像上的泛化能力；其次在MillionAID数据集上训练iBOT自监督视觉编码器，并针对遥感特性进行了修改。

Result: 结果显示，在ViT-B规模下，这些预训练模型都没有比通用基线带来一致的改进。

Conclusion: 结论是至少在较小规模下，专用基础模型并不比通用视觉基础模型更有用。

Abstract: Foundation models have advanced machine learning across various modalities,
including images. Recently multiple teams trained foundation models specialized
for remote sensing applications. This line of research is motivated by the
distinct characteristics of remote sensing imagery, specific applications and
types of robustness useful for satellite image analysis. In this work we
systematically challenge the idea that specific foundation models are more
useful than general-purpose vision foundation models, at least in the small
scale. First, we design a simple benchmark that measures generalization of
remote sensing models towards images with lower resolution for two downstream
tasks. Second, we train iBOT, a self-supervised vision encoder, on MillionAID,
an ImageNet-scale satellite imagery dataset, with several modifications
specific to remote sensing. We show that none of those pretrained models bring
consistent improvements upon general-purpose baselines at the ViT-B scale.

Motivation: 利用多模态大语言模型的能力来联合处理文本和视频，有效定位视频中的自然语言查询，解决直接定位时信息不足的问题。

Method: 采用两阶段方法：首先将语言查询转换为包含缺失细节和线索的丰富句子，然后使用轻量级解码器基于上下文化的查询表示预测准确边界。训练时使用多实例学习目标动态选择最佳查询版本。

Result: 在多个时间视频定位和段落定位基准测试中取得最先进的结果，显著优于所有先前提出的基于LLM的时间定位方法，在零样本评估场景中保持明显优势。

Conclusion: ED-VTG方法在视频时间定位任务中表现出色，既优于或可与专用模型相媲美，同时在零样本评估中具有明显优势。

Abstract: We introduce ED-VTG, a method for fine-grained video temporal grounding
utilizing multi-modal large language models. Our approach harnesses the
capabilities of multimodal LLMs to jointly process text and video, in order to
effectively localize natural language queries in videos through a two-stage
process. Rather than being directly grounded, language queries are initially
transformed into enriched sentences that incorporate missing details and cues
to aid in grounding. In the second stage, these enriched queries are grounded,
using a lightweight decoder, which specializes at predicting accurate
boundaries conditioned on contextualized representations of the enriched
queries. To mitigate noise and reduce the impact of hallucinations, our model
is trained with a multiple-instance-learning objective that dynamically selects
the optimal version of the query for each training sample. We demonstrate
state-of-the-art results across various benchmarks in temporal video grounding
and paragraph grounding settings. Experiments reveal that our method
significantly outperforms all previously proposed LLM-based temporal grounding
approaches and is either superior or comparable to specialized models, while
maintaining a clear advantage against them in zero-shot evaluation scenarios.

TL;DR: 提出W2R2训练框架，通过解耦表示学习和针对性捷径抑制来解决多模态3D定位中的2D语义偏差问题，显著提升定位精度和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态3D定位模型存在严重的"2D语义偏差"问题，过度依赖2D图像特征进行粗略定位，而忽视3D几何输入，导致融合性能不佳。

Method: W2R2框架将2D特征作为"What"识别的语义信标，3D特征作为"Where"定位的空间锚点，采用双目标损失函数（对齐损失和伪标签损失）进行解耦表示学习。

Result: 在ScanRefer和ScanQA数据集上的实验表明，W2R2显著提升了定位精度和鲁棒性，特别是在杂乱户外场景中表现突出。

Conclusion: W2R2通过重新形成表示空间，在不改变推理架构的情况下实现了精确的3D定位，有效解决了2D语义偏差问题。

Abstract: Multimodal 3D grounding has garnered considerable interest in Vision-Language
Models (VLMs) \cite{yin2025spatial} for advancing spatial reasoning in complex
environments. However, these models suffer from a severe "2D semantic bias"
that arises from over-reliance on 2D image features for coarse localization,
largely disregarding 3D geometric inputs and resulting in suboptimal fusion
performance. In this paper, we propose a novel training framework called
What-Where Representation Re-Forming (W2R2) to tackle this issue via
disentangled representation learning and targeted shortcut suppression. Our
approach fundamentally reshapes the model's internal space by designating 2D
features as semantic beacons for "What" identification and 3D features as
spatial anchors for "Where" localization, enabling precise 3D grounding without
modifying inference architecture. Key components include a dual-objective loss
function with an Alignment Loss that supervises fused predictions using adapted
cross-entropy for multimodal synergy, and a Pseudo-Label Loss that penalizes
overly effective 2D-dominant pseudo-outputs via a margin-based mechanism.
Experiments conducted on ScanRefer and ScanQA demonstrate the effectiveness of
W2R2, with significant gains in localization accuracy and robustness,
particularly in cluttered outdoor scenes.

Motivation: 解决真实指纹数据集收集耗时、昂贵且需要严格隐私保护的问题，探索使用合成指纹数据来应对隐私、成本和可访问性方面的挑战。

Method: 使用条件StyleGAN2-ADA和StyleGAN3架构生成特定手指身份的高分辨率合成活体指纹，然后利用CycleGANs将这些指纹转换为模拟各种攻击材料（如EcoFlex、Play-Doh）的逼真假指纹。

Result: StyleGAN3模型FID低至5，生成指纹在0.01%错误接受率下达到99.47%的真实接受率；StyleGAN2-ADA模型在相同条件下达到98.67%的真实接受率。匹配实验确认了强大的隐私保护特性，无显著身份泄露证据。

Conclusion: 该方法成功创建了高质量的合成指纹数据集，在保持强隐私保护的同时，为开发鲁棒的假指纹检测系统提供了重要资源。

Abstract: Large fingerprint datasets, while important for training and evaluation, are
time-consuming and expensive to collect and require strict privacy measures.
Researchers are exploring the use of synthetic fingerprint data to address
these issues. This paper presents a novel approach for generating synthetic
fingerprint images (both spoof and live), addressing concerns related to
privacy, cost, and accessibility in biometric data collection. Our approach
utilizes conditional StyleGAN2-ADA and StyleGAN3 architectures to produce
high-resolution synthetic live fingerprints, conditioned on specific finger
identities (thumb through little finger). Additionally, we employ CycleGANs to
translate these into realistic spoof fingerprints, simulating a variety of
presentation attack materials (e.g., EcoFlex, Play-Doh). These synthetic spoof
fingerprints are crucial for developing robust spoof detection systems. Through
these generative models, we created two synthetic datasets (DB2 and DB3), each
containing 1,500 fingerprint images of all ten fingers with multiple
impressions per finger, and including corresponding spoofs in eight material
types. The results indicate robust performance: our StyleGAN3 model achieves a
Fr\'echet Inception Distance (FID) as low as 5, and the generated fingerprints
achieve a True Accept Rate of 99.47% at a 0.01% False Accept Rate. The
StyleGAN2-ADA model achieved a TAR of 98.67% at the same 0.01% FAR. We assess
fingerprint quality using standard metrics (NFIQ2, MINDTCT), and notably,
matching experiments confirm strong privacy preservation, with no significant
evidence of identity leakage, confirming the strong privacy-preserving
properties of our synthetic datasets.

TL;DR: 本研究开发了一个临床医生参与的深度学习管道，使用VNet模型和半监督学习在CT图像上实现肺癌分割和预后预测，获得了最佳性能（Dice=0.83）和临床医生的信任。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 肺癌是癌症死亡的主要原因，CT成像是筛查、预后和治疗的核心。手动分割存在变异性且耗时，而深度学习虽然提供自动化，但在临床采用方面面临障碍。

Method: 基于知识到行动框架，开发临床医生参与的深度学习管道。使用来自12个公共数据集的999名患者的多中心CT数据，比较5个深度学习模型（3D Attention U-Net、ResUNet、VNet、ReconNet、SAM-Med3D），评估分割可重复性和预后建模（监督学习和半监督学习）。

Result: VNet获得最佳性能（Dice=0.83，IoU=0.71），放射组学稳定性最高（平均相关性=0.76，ICC=0.65），在半监督学习下预测准确率最高（准确率=0.88，F1=0.83）。半监督学习在所有模型中均优于监督学习。放射科医生偏好VNet的瘤周表示和平滑边界。

Conclusion: 将VNet与半监督学习结合可产生准确、可重复且临床可信的CT肺癌预后结果，为以医生为中心的AI转化提供了可行路径。

Abstract: Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer mortality, with CT imaging
central to screening, prognosis, and treatment. Manual segmentation is variable
and time-intensive, while deep learning (DL) offers automation but faces
barriers to clinical adoption. Guided by the Knowledge-to-Action framework,
this study develops a clinician-in-the-loop DL pipeline to enhance
reproducibility, prognostic accuracy, and clinical trust. Multi-center CT data
from 999 patients across 12 public datasets were analyzed using five DL models
(3D Attention U-Net, ResUNet, VNet, ReconNet, SAM-Med3D), benchmarked against
expert contours on whole and click-point cropped images. Segmentation
reproducibility was assessed using 497 PySERA-extracted radiomic features via
Spearman correlation, ICC, Wilcoxon tests, and MANOVA, while prognostic
modeling compared supervised (SL) and semi-supervised learning (SSL) across 38
dimensionality reduction strategies and 24 classifiers. Six physicians
qualitatively evaluated masks across seven domains, including clinical
meaningfulness, boundary quality, prognostic value, trust, and workflow
integration. VNet achieved the best performance (Dice = 0.83, IoU = 0.71),
radiomic stability (mean correlation = 0.76, ICC = 0.65), and predictive
accuracy under SSL (accuracy = 0.88, F1 = 0.83). SSL consistently outperformed
SL across models. Radiologists favored VNet for peritumoral representation and
smoother boundaries, preferring AI-generated initial masks for refinement
rather than replacement. These results demonstrate that integrating VNet with
SSL yields accurate, reproducible, and clinically trusted CT-based lung cancer
prognosis, highlighting a feasible path toward physician-centered AI
translation.

Abstract: Advanced feature extraction methods have significantly contributed to
enhancing the task of person re-identification. In addition, modifications to
objective functions have been developed to further improve performance.
Nonetheless, selecting better class representatives is an underexplored area of
research that can also lead to advancements in re-identification performance.
Although past works have experimented with using the centroid of a gallery
image class during training, only a few have investigated alternative
representations during the retrieval stage. In this paper, we demonstrate that
these prior techniques yield suboptimal results in terms of re-identification
metrics. To address the re-identification problem, we propose a generalized
selection method that involves choosing representations that are not limited to
class centroids. Our approach strikes a balance between accuracy and mean
average precision, leading to improvements beyond the state of the art. For
example, the actual number of representations per class can be adjusted to meet
specific application requirements. We apply our methodology on top of multiple
re-identification embeddings, and in all cases it substantially improves upon
contemporary results

Method: 在推理时通过基于熵的目标函数对小规模可训练控制器进行优化，调整LMM的值缓存，改善微观探索和利用行为，无需任何数据集监督或强化学习。

Conclusion: 基于熵的信号可以有效指导LMM推理过程，V-Reason方法在无需额外训练的情况下显著提升视频推理性能，同时大幅降低计算开销。

Abstract: Video reasoning using Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) relies on costly
reinforcement learning (RL) and verbose chain-of-thought, resulting in
substantial computational overhead during both training and inference.
Moreover, the mechanisms that control the thinking process in these reasoning
models are very limited. In this paper, using entropy of the model's output as
a signal, we discover that the high-quality models go through a series of
micro-explorations and micro-exploitations which keep the reasoning process
grounded (i.e., avoid excessive randomness while the model is exploring or
thinking through an answer). We further observe that once this "thinking"
process is over, more accurate models demonstrate a better convergence by
reducing the entropy significantly via a final exploitation phase (i.e., a more
certain convergence towards a solution trajectory). We then use these novel,
theoretically-grounded insights to tune the model's behavior directly at
inference, without using any RL or supervised fine-tuning. Specifically, during
inference, our proposed approach called V-Reason (Video-Reason) adapts the
value cache of the LMM via a few optimization steps on a small, trainable
controller using an entropy-based objective, i.e., no supervision from any
dataset or RL is necessary. This tuning improves the model's micro-exploration
and exploitation behavior during inference. Our experiments show that our
proposed method achieves significant improvements over the base
instruction-tuned models across several video reasoning datasets, narrowing the
gap with RL-trained models to within 0.6% average accuracy without any
training, while offering massive efficiency benefits: output tokens are reduced
by 58.6% compared to the RL model.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 理解通用基础视觉模型与专用模型之间的权衡对于高效特征编码设计至关重要，但目前尚未完全明确。

Method: 使用轻量可训练neck来探测冻结特征的适应性，量化专用化的信息理论成本，并进行跨neck分析。

Result: SAM2在深度估计等空间相关任务上表现优异，但在姿态估计和图像描述等概念较远的任务上表现不如通用模型Hiera，显示出语义信息的损失。

Conclusion: 专用化在提升特定任务性能的同时会带来表示瓶颈，为设计高效特征编码和适应策略提供了量化基础。

Abstract: The trade-off between general-purpose foundation vision models and their
specialized counterparts is critical for efficient feature coding design and is
not yet fully understood. We investigate this trade-off by comparing the
feature versatility of the general-purpose Hiera encoder against the
segmentation-specialized Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2). Using a lightweight,
trainable neck to probe the adaptability of their frozen features, we quantify
the information-theoretic cost of specialization. Our results reveal that while
SAM2's specialization is highly effective for spatially-related tasks like
depth estimation, it comes at a cost. The specialized SAM2 encoder
underperforms its generalist predecessor, Hiera, on conceptually distant tasks
such as pose estimation and image captioning, demonstrating a measurable loss
of broader semantic information. A novel cross-neck analysis on SAM2 reveals
that each level of adaptation creates a further representational bottleneck.
Our analysis illuminates these trade-offs in feature universality, providing a

*Zhe Luo,Wenjing Jia,Stuart Perry*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了ProDAT方法，一种基于密度感知的渐进式点云编码技术，通过单一模型实现多比特率下的渐进解码，显著提升了编码效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D点云在自动驾驶、增强现实等应用中需要实时处理和低延迟，但大数据量和带宽限制阻碍了高质量服务的部署。现有学习型编码方法的固定潜在表示不支持渐进解码。

Method: 提出密度感知的尾丢弃机制，利用密度信息作为指导信号，根据重要性自适应解码潜在特征和坐标，实现单一模型的多比特率渐进解码。

Result: 在基准数据集上的实验表明，ProDAT不仅实现了渐进编码，还在编码效率上优于现有最先进的学习型编码技术，在SemanticKITTI上PSNR-D2的BD-rate提升超过28.6%，在ShapeNet上超过18.15%。

Conclusion: ProDAT成功解决了点云渐进编码的问题，在保持高编码效率的同时实现了灵活的渐进解码能力。

Abstract: Three-dimensional (3D) point clouds are becoming increasingly vital in
applications such as autonomous driving, augmented reality, and immersive
communication, demanding real-time processing and low latency. However, their
large data volumes and bandwidth constraints hinder the deployment of
high-quality services in resource-limited environments. Progres- sive coding,
which allows for decoding at varying levels of detail, provides an alternative
by allowing initial partial decoding with subsequent refinement. Although
recent learning-based point cloud geometry coding methods have achieved notable
success, their fixed latent representation does not support progressive
decoding. To bridge this gap, we propose ProDAT, a novel density-aware
tail-drop mechanism for progressive point cloud coding. By leveraging density
information as a guidance signal, latent features and coordinates are decoded
adaptively based on their significance, therefore achieving progressive
decoding at multiple bitrates using one single model. Experimental results on
benchmark datasets show that the proposed ProDAT not only enables progressive
coding but also achieves superior coding efficiency compared to
state-of-the-art learning-based coding techniques, with over 28.6% BD-rate
improvement for PSNR- D2 on SemanticKITTI and over 18.15% for ShapeNet

Abstract: Multimodal object detection improves robustness in chal- lenging conditions
by leveraging complementary cues from multiple sensor modalities. We introduce
Filtered Multi- Modal Cross Attention Fusion (FMCAF), a preprocess- ing
architecture designed to enhance the fusion of RGB and infrared (IR) inputs.
FMCAF combines a frequency- domain filtering block (Freq-Filter) to suppress
redun- dant spectral features with a cross-attention-based fusion module (MCAF)
to improve intermodal feature sharing. Unlike approaches tailored to specific
datasets, FMCAF aims for generalizability, improving performance across
different multimodal challenges without requiring dataset- specific tuning. On
LLVIP (low-light pedestrian detec- tion) and VEDAI (aerial vehicle detection),
FMCAF outper- forms traditional fusion (concatenation), achieving +13.9% mAP@50
on VEDAI and +1.1% on LLVIP. These results support the potential of FMCAF as a
flexible foundation for robust multimodal fusion in future detection pipelines.

TL;DR: GSPlane通过引入平面先验来改进高斯泼溅的几何重建质量，特别针对平面区域提供更平滑精确的网格重建，同时保持渲染质量不变。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有高斯泼溅方法在重建平面区域时往往缺乏足够的平滑度和精度，这限制了其在场景编辑和物理仿真等下游应用中的实用性。

Method: 利用现成的分割和法向量预测模型提取平面先验，建立结构化平面高斯坐标表示；引入动态高斯重分类器自适应重新分类梯度高的平面高斯；利用优化后的平面先验优化网格布局。

Result: 在保持渲染质量的同时，显著提高了提取网格的几何精度，减少了顶点和面片数量，改善了拓扑结构。

Conclusion: GSPlane通过引入平面先验有效解决了高斯泼溅在平面重建中的局限性，为场景编辑和物理仿真提供了更好的结构化表示。

Abstract: Planes are fundamental primitives of 3D sences, especially in man-made
environments such as indoor spaces and urban streets. Representing these planes
in a structured and parameterized format facilitates scene editing and physical
simulations in downstream applications. Recently, Gaussian Splatting (GS) has
demonstrated remarkable effectiveness in the Novel View Synthesis task, with
extensions showing great potential in accurate surface reconstruction. However,
even state-of-the-art GS representations often struggle to reconstruct planar
regions with sufficient smoothness and precision. To address this issue, we
propose GSPlane, which recovers accurate geometry and produces clean and
well-structured mesh connectivity for plane regions in the reconstructed scene.
By leveraging off-the-shelf segmentation and normal prediction models, GSPlane
extracts robust planar priors to establish structured representations for
planar Gaussian coordinates, which help guide the training process by enforcing
geometric consistency. To further enhance training robustness, a Dynamic
Gaussian Re-classifier is introduced to adaptively reclassify planar Gaussians
with persistently high gradients as non-planar, ensuring more reliable
optimization. Furthermore, we utilize the optimized planar priors to refine the
mesh layouts, significantly improving topological structure while reducing the
number of vertices and faces. We also explore applications of the structured
planar representation, which enable decoupling and flexible manipulation of
objects on supportive planes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that, with no
sacrifice in rendering quality, the introduction of planar priors significantly
improves the geometric accuracy of the extracted meshes across various
baselines.

TL;DR: 提出了一种针对预训练扩散模型的优化策略，通过潜在细化管道和双向交互机制，在保持感知真实性的同时显著提升内容保真度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 预训练扩散方法在低层视觉任务中表现出色，但往往以牺牲内容保真度为代价来获得更高的感知真实性，特别是在低光照场景下，黑暗导致的严重退化信息限制了有效控制。

Method: 引入潜在细化管道来恢复VAE编码过程中丢失的空间细节，并通过动态双向交互机制让细化后的潜在条件与噪声潜在相互作用。

Result: 大量实验证明该方法在预训练扩散方法中实现了显著的内容保真度提升。

Conclusion: 该优化策略是即插即用的，可以无缝集成到现有扩散网络中提供更有效的控制，在保持真实性和美学的同时增强了保真度。

Abstract: Diffusion-based methods, leveraging pre-trained large models like Stable
Diffusion via ControlNet, have achieved remarkable performance in several
low-level vision tasks. However, Pre-Trained Diffusion-Based (PTDB) methods
often sacrifice content fidelity to attain higher perceptual realism. This
issue is exacerbated in low-light scenarios, where severely degraded
information caused by the darkness limits effective control. We identify two
primary causes of fidelity loss: the absence of suitable conditional latent
modeling and the lack of bidirectional interaction between the conditional
latent and noisy latent in the diffusion process. To address this, we propose a
novel optimization strategy for conditioning in pre-trained diffusion models,
enhancing fidelity while preserving realism and aesthetics. Our method
introduces a mechanism to recover spatial details lost during VAE encoding,
i.e., a latent refinement pipeline incorporating generative priors.
Additionally, the refined latent condition interacts dynamically with the noisy
latent, leading to improved restoration performance. Our approach is
plug-and-play, seamlessly integrating into existing diffusion networks to
provide more effective control. Extensive experiments demonstrate significant
fidelity improvements in PTDB methods.

Motivation: 开发一种在消费级相机拍摄的视频中嵌入水印的技术，支持隐私保护和内容验证，同时确保水印对人眼不可见。

Method: 采用光谱调制而非强度调制，综合考虑人眼视觉系统敏感性、相机传感器光谱灵敏度和LED产生白光的特性，优化LED光谱配置。

Result: 能够在标准帧率（30-60 fps）下提取水印，在10秒视频中嵌入128位信息，足以支持隐私保护和内容验证的元数据。

Conclusion: 该方法成功实现了对人眼不可见但对相机可检测的水印嵌入，为隐私保护和内容验证提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: This paper introduces a method for using LED-based environmental lighting to
produce visually imperceptible watermarks for consumer cameras. Our approach
optimizes an LED light source's spectral profile to be minimally visible to the
human eye while remaining highly detectable by typical consumer cameras. The
method jointly considers the human visual system's sensitivity to visible
spectra, modern consumer camera sensors' spectral sensitivity, and narrowband
LEDs' ability to generate broadband spectra perceived as "white light"
(specifically, D65 illumination). To ensure imperceptibility, we employ
spectral modulation rather than intensity modulation. Unlike conventional
visible light communication, our approach enables watermark extraction at
standard low frame rates (30-60 fps). While the information transfer rate is
modest-embedding 128 bits within a 10-second video clip-this capacity is
sufficient for essential metadata supporting privacy protection and content
verification.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法通过扰动文本条件嵌入生成OOD样本，存在语义不稳定和偏移多样性不足的问题，限制了在真实OOD场景中的泛化能力

Method: GOOD框架使用现成的ID分类器，采用双重引导：图像级引导基于对数分区的梯度减少输入似然，特征级引导基于k-NN距离促进特征稀疏区域采样

Result: 训练使用GOOD生成的样本可以显著提升OOD检测性能，通过定量和定性分析验证了有效性

Conclusion: GOOD框架通过双重引导机制实现了更可控和多样化的OOD样本生成，提出的统一OOD评分增强了检测鲁棒性

Abstract: Recent advancements have explored text-to-image diffusion models for
synthesizing out-of-distribution (OOD) samples, substantially enhancing the
performance of OOD detection. However, existing approaches typically rely on
perturbing text-conditioned embeddings, resulting in semantic instability and
insufficient shift diversity, which limit generalization to realistic OOD. To
address these challenges, we propose GOOD, a novel and flexible framework that
directly guides diffusion sampling trajectories towards OOD regions using
off-the-shelf in-distribution (ID) classifiers. GOOD incorporates dual-level
guidance: (1) Image-level guidance based on the gradient of log partition to
reduce input likelihood, drives samples toward low-density regions in pixel
space. (2) Feature-level guidance, derived from k-NN distance in the
classifier's latent space, promotes sampling in feature-sparse regions. Hence,
this dual-guidance design enables more controllable and diverse OOD sample
generation. Additionally, we introduce a unified OOD score that adaptively
combines image and feature discrepancies, enhancing detection robustness. We
perform thorough quantitative and qualitative analyses to evaluate the
effectiveness of GOOD, demonstrating that training with samples generated by
GOOD can notably enhance OOD detection performance.

Motivation: 铰接物体（如笔记本电脑和抽屉）由于其多部件几何结构和可变关节配置，在3D重建和姿态估计方面面临显著挑战，这些配置在不同状态下引入了结构多样性。

Method: 首先通过运动学感知VAE将完整几何、关节角度和部件分割编码到结构化潜在空间；然后使用两个条件扩散模型分别回归全局姿态和关节参数，以及从部分观测生成运动学感知潜在代码；最后通过迭代优化模块双向优化重建精度和运动学参数。

Conclusion: KineDiff3D框架能够有效解决铰接物体的3D重建和姿态估计问题，通过运动学感知的扩散模型实现了准确的形状重建和运动属性估计。

Abstract: Articulated objects, such as laptops and drawers, exhibit significant
challenges for 3D reconstruction and pose estimation due to their multi-part
geometries and variable joint configurations, which introduce structural
diversity across different states. To address these challenges, we propose
KineDiff3D: Kinematic-Aware Diffusion for Category-Level Articulated Object
Shape Reconstruction and Generation, a unified framework for reconstructing
diverse articulated instances and pose estimation from single view input.
Specifically, we first encode complete geometry (SDFs), joint angles, and part
segmentation into a structured latent space via a novel Kinematic-Aware VAE
(KA-VAE). In addition, we employ two conditional diffusion models: one for
regressing global pose (SE(3)) and joint parameters, and another for generating
the kinematic-aware latent code from partial observations. Finally, we produce
an iterative optimization module that bidirectionally refines reconstruction
accuracy and kinematic parameters via Chamfer-distance minimization while
preserving articulation constraints. Experimental results on synthetic,
semi-synthetic, and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our
approach in accurately reconstructing articulated objects and estimating their
kinematic properties.

Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型在从2D图像推断3D几何方面存在空间推理能力不足的问题，限制了从单张图像生成可编辑参数化CAD模型的潜力。

Method: 采用两阶段后训练框架：1) 监督微调阶段使用深度和表面法线图作为密集几何先验，与RGB图像形成多通道输入；2) 强化学习阶段引入组长度奖励，在保持几何保真度的同时促进生成更简洁的参数化建模序列。

Result: 在DeepCAD和Fusion360数据集上的实验表明，GACO-CAD在相同MLLM骨干网络下达到最先进性能，在代码有效性、几何精度和建模简洁性方面一致优于现有方法。

Conclusion: GACO-CAD通过几何先验和简洁建模奖励的有效结合，成功提升了从单张图像生成可编辑CAD模型的几何准确性和建模效率。

Abstract: Generating editable, parametric CAD models from a single image holds great
potential to lower the barriers of industrial concept design. However, current
multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) still struggle with accurately
inferring 3D geometry from 2D images due to limited spatial reasoning
capabilities. We address this limitation by introducing GACO-CAD, a novel
two-stage post-training framework. It is designed to achieve a joint objective:
simultaneously improving the geometric accuracy of the generated CAD models and
encouraging the use of more concise modeling procedures. First, during
supervised fine-tuning, we leverage depth and surface normal maps as dense
geometric priors, combining them with the RGB image to form a multi-channel
input. In the context of single-view reconstruction, these priors provide
complementary spatial cues that help the MLLM more reliably recover 3D geometry
from 2D observations. Second, during reinforcement learning, we introduce a
group length reward that, while preserving high geometric fidelity, promotes
the generation of more compact and less redundant parametric modeling
sequences. A simple dynamic weighting strategy is adopted to stabilize
training. Experiments on the DeepCAD and Fusion360 datasets show that GACO-CAD
achieves state-of-the-art performance under the same MLLM backbone,
consistently outperforming existing methods in terms of code validity,
geometric accuracy, and modeling conciseness.

Method: 研究了多种现成的最先进对抗攻击在不同预处理技术下的迁移性，分析了人脸检测模型和降采样插值方法的影响，并提出使用输入变换的预处理不变方法来提升攻击迁移性。

Result: 人脸检测模型选择可使攻击成功率降低高达78%，而降采样插值方法影响相对较小。提出的预处理不变方法可将攻击迁移性提升高达27%。

Abstract: Face Recognition (FR) models have been shown to be vulnerable to adversarial
examples that subtly alter benign facial images, exposing blind spots in these
systems, as well as protecting user privacy. End-to-end FR systems first obtain
preprocessed faces from diverse facial imagery prior to computing the
similarity of the deep feature embeddings. Whilst face preprocessing is a
critical component of FR systems, and hence adversarial attacks against them,
we observe that this preprocessing is often overlooked in blackbox settings.
Our study seeks to investigate the transferability of several out-of-the-box
state-of-the-art adversarial attacks against FR when applied against different
preprocessing techniques used in a blackbox setting. We observe that the choice
of face detection model can degrade the attack success rate by up to 78%,
whereas choice of interpolation method during downsampling has relatively
minimal impacts. Furthermore, we find that the requirement for facial
preprocessing even degrades attack strength in a whitebox setting, due to the
unintended interaction of produced noise vectors against face detection models.
Based on these findings, we propose a preprocessing-invariant method using
input transformations that improves the transferability of the studied attacks
by up to 27%. Our findings highlight the importance of preprocessing in FR
systems, and the need for its consideration towards improving the adversarial
generalisation of facial adversarial examples.

Motivation: 解决MAR模型在视觉生成中并行生成能力受限于空间相关视觉token建模复杂性的问题，通过分阶段生成来平衡效率与质量。

Method: GtR将生成分为两个阶段：结构生成（建立全局语义框架）和细节重建（高效完成剩余token）。还提出FTS（频率加权token选择）为图像细节分配更多计算资源。

Result: 在ImageNet类条件生成和文本到图像生成任务上实现3.72倍加速，同时保持可比质量（FID: 1.59, IS: 304.4 vs 原始1.59, 299.1）。

Conclusion: GtR方法在各种模型规模和生成任务上显著优于现有加速方法，为MAR模型提供了有效的加速解决方案。

Abstract: Masked Autoregressive (MAR) models promise better efficiency in visual
generation than autoregressive (AR) models for the ability of parallel
generation, yet their acceleration potential remains constrained by the
modeling complexity of spatially correlated visual tokens in a single step. To
address this limitation, we introduce Generation then Reconstruction (GtR), a
training-free hierarchical sampling strategy that decomposes generation into
two stages: structure generation establishing global semantic scaffolding,
followed by detail reconstruction efficiently completing remaining tokens.
Assuming that it is more difficult to create an image from scratch than to
complement images based on a basic image framework, GtR is designed to achieve
acceleration by computing the reconstruction stage quickly while maintaining
the generation quality by computing the generation stage slowly. Moreover,
observing that tokens on the details of an image often carry more semantic
information than tokens in the salient regions, we further propose
Frequency-Weighted Token Selection (FTS) to offer more computation budget to
tokens on image details, which are localized based on the energy of high
frequency information. Extensive experiments on ImageNet class-conditional and
text-to-image generation demonstrate 3.72x speedup on MAR-H while maintaining
comparable quality (e.g., FID: 1.59, IS: 304.4 vs. original 1.59, 299.1),
substantially outperforming existing acceleration methods across various model
scales and generation tasks. Our codes will be released in

Abstract: Automated plankton recognition models face significant challenges during
real-world deployment due to distribution shifts (Out-of-Distribution, OoD)
between training and test data. This stems from plankton's complex
morphologies, vast species diversity, and the continuous discovery of novel
species, which leads to unpredictable errors during inference. Despite rapid
advancements in OoD detection methods in recent years, the field of plankton
recognition still lacks a systematic integration of the latest computer vision
developments and a unified benchmark for large-scale evaluation. To address
this, this paper meticulously designed a series of OoD benchmarks simulating
various distribution shift scenarios based on the DYB-PlanktonNet dataset
\cite{875n-f104-21}, and systematically evaluated twenty-two OoD detection
methods. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the ViM
\cite{wang2022vim} method significantly outperforms other approaches in our
constructed benchmarks, particularly excelling in Far-OoD scenarios with
substantial improvements in key metrics. This comprehensive evaluation not only
provides a reliable reference for algorithm selection in automated plankton
recognition but also lays a solid foundation for future research in plankton
OoD detection. To our knowledge, this study marks the first large-scale,
systematic evaluation and analysis of Out-of-Distribution data detection
methods in plankton recognition. Code is available at

Abstract: Photorealistic 3D head avatars are vital for telepresence, gaming, and VR.
However, most methods focus solely on facial regions, ignoring natural
hand-face interactions, such as a hand resting on the chin or fingers gently
touching the cheek, which convey cognitive states like pondering. In this work,
we present a novel framework that jointly learns detailed head avatars and the
non-rigid deformations induced by hand-face interactions.
  There are two principal challenges in this task. First, naively tracking hand
and face separately fails to capture their relative poses. To overcome this, we
propose to combine depth order loss with contact regularization during pose
tracking, ensuring correct spatial relationships between the face and hand.
Second, no publicly available priors exist for hand-induced deformations,
making them non-trivial to learn from monocular videos. To address this, we
learn a PCA basis specific to hand-induced facial deformations from a face-hand
interaction dataset. This reduces the problem to estimating a compact set of
PCA parameters rather than a full spatial deformation field. Furthermore,
inspired by physics-based simulation, we incorporate a contact loss that
provides additional supervision, significantly reducing interpenetration
artifacts and enhancing the physical plausibility of the results.
  We evaluate our approach on RGB(D) videos captured by an iPhone.
Additionally, to better evaluate the reconstructed geometry, we construct a
synthetic dataset of avatars with various types of hand interactions. We show
that our method can capture better appearance and more accurate deforming
geometry of the face than SOTA surface reconstruction methods.

<details>

Motivation: 现有GCD方法假设训练时同时访问标记和未标记数据且来自相同领域，限制了在涉及分布偏移的开放世界场景中的适用性。DG-GCD要求模型泛化到包含新类别的未见领域，而无需在训练时访问目标领域数据。

Method: 使用GPT引导的扩散进行源领域增强以暴露最小但多样的领域变化；引入切线CutMix进行曲率感知插值以合成伪新样本；结合惩罚Busemann对齐、混合双曲对比正则化和自适应异常值排斥的统一损失；可学习的曲率参数适应数据集复杂性。

Conclusion: HIDISC通过双曲表示学习框架有效解决了DG-GCD问题，避免了计算成本高的情景训练，实现了更好的领域和类别泛化性能。

Abstract: Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) aims to classify test-time samples into
either seen categories** -- available during training -- or novel ones, without
relying on label supervision. Most existing GCD methods assume simultaneous
access to labeled and unlabeled data during training and arising from the same
domain, limiting applicability in open-world scenarios involving distribution
shifts. Domain Generalization with GCD (DG-GCD) lifts this constraint by
requiring models to generalize to unseen domains containing novel categories,
without accessing targetdomain data during training. The only prior DG-GCD
method, DG2CD-Net, relies on episodic training with multiple synthetic domains
and task vector aggregation, incurring high computational cost and error
accumulation. We propose HIDISC, a hyperbolic representation learning framework
that achieves domain and category-level generalization without episodic
simulation. To expose the model to minimal but diverse domain variations, we
augment the source domain using GPT-guided diffusion, avoiding overfitting
while maintaining efficiency. To structure the representation space, we
introduce Tangent CutMix, a curvature-aware interpolation that synthesizes
pseudo-novel samples in tangent space, preserving manifold consistency. A
unified loss -- combining penalized Busemann alignment, hybrid hyperbolic
contrastive regularization, and adaptive outlier repulsion -- **facilitates
compact, semantically structured embeddings. A learnable curvature parameter
further adapts the geometry to dataset complexity. HIDISC achieves
state-of-the-art results on PACS , Office-Home , and DomainNet, consistently
outperforming the existing Euclidean and hyperbolic (DG)-GCD baselines.

Motivation: 随着视觉语言模型处理能力增强，视觉令牌冗余导致推理成本急剧上升，现有方法忽视文本提示的指导，无法优先考虑任务相关性。

Method: 采用分层方法：先选择任务相关的核心视觉令牌，再补充多样性令牌以保留更广泛上下文，实现提示感知的视觉令牌剪枝。

Result: 在多个模型和基准测试中，即使剪枝高达90%的令牌，性能仍能匹配或超越最先进方法，同时显著减少GPU内存占用和推理延迟。

Conclusion: 该方法通过提示感知的视觉令牌剪枝，在保持模型性能的同时有效解决了视觉令牌冗余带来的高推理成本问题。

Abstract: As the capabilities of Vision-Language Models (VLMs) advance, they can
process increasingly large inputs, which, unlike in LLMs, generates significant
visual token redundancy and leads to prohibitive inference costs. While many
methods aim to reduce these costs by pruning visual tokens, existing
approaches, whether based on attention or diversity, typically neglect the
guidance of the text prompt and thus fail to prioritize task relevance. In this
work, we propose a novel, zero-shot method that reframes the problem by
introducing a prompt-aware perspective, explicitly modeling visual token
pruning as a balance between task relevance and information diversity. Our
hierarchical approach first selects a core set of task-relevant visual tokens
and then supplements them with diversity tokens to preserve broader context.
Experiments across multiple models and benchmarks show that our method achieves
performance that matches or surpasses the state-of-the-art with only minimal
accuracy loss, even when pruning up to 90\% of the tokens. Furthermore, these
gains are accompanied by significant reductions in GPU memory footprint and
inference latency.

TL;DR: 使用Segment Anything Model (SAM)进行微调，开发了一个专门用于检测孟加拉国河流侵蚀的高精度AI模型，并创建了首个包含消失定居点标注的数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 孟加拉国的河流每年吞噬大量村庄和农田，造成严重破坏和人口迁移。传统的人工分析方法难以有效追踪这种缓慢但持续的灾害。

Method: 首先使用简单的颜色通道分析进行粗略的土地和水体分割，然后微调SAM的掩码解码器以识别河岸侵蚀的细微特征。

Result: 模型在河流侵蚀检测方面表现出色，平均IoU达到86.30%，Dice分数达到92.60%，显著优于传统方法和现成的深度学习模型。

Conclusion: 该研究提供了监测河流侵蚀、预测其轨迹和保护脆弱社区的有力工具，为政策制定者和灾害管理机构提供了新的分析视角。

Abstract: The great rivers of Bangladesh, arteries of commerce and sustenance, are also
agents of relentless destruction. Each year, they swallow whole villages and
vast tracts of farmland, erasing communities from the map and displacing
thousands of families. To track this slow-motion catastrophe has, until now,
been a Herculean task for human analysts. Here we show how a powerful
general-purpose vision model, the Segment Anything Model (SAM), can be adapted
to this task with remarkable precision. To do this, we assembled a new dataset
- a digital chronicle of loss compiled from historical Google Earth imagery of
Bangladesh's most vulnerable regions, including Mokterer Char Union, Kedarpur
Union, Balchipara village, and Chowhali Upazila, from 2003 to 2025. Crucially,
this dataset is the first to include manually annotated data on the settlements
that have vanished beneath the water. Our method first uses a simple
color-channel analysis to provide a rough segmentation of land and water, and
then fine-tunes SAM's mask decoder to recognize the subtle signatures of
riverbank erosion. The resulting model demonstrates a keen eye for this
destructive process, achieving a mean Intersection over Union of 86.30% and a
Dice score of 92.60% - a performance that significantly surpasses traditional
methods and off-the-shelf deep learning models. This work delivers three key
contributions: the first annotated dataset of disappeared settlements in
Bangladesh due to river erosion; a specialized AI model fine-tuned for this
critical task; and a method for quantifying land loss with compelling visual
evidence. Together, these tools provide a powerful new lens through which
policymakers and disaster management agencies can monitor erosion, anticipate
its trajectory, and ultimately protect the vulnerable communities in its path.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有电竞比赛结果预测研究多基于比赛日志和统计数据，但VALORANT作为需要复杂策略的FPS游戏，需要更深入分析比赛录像中的战术信息。

Method: 使用TimeSformer视频识别模型，从小地图信息中提取详细的战术特征，包括角色位置信息和其他游戏内事件，构建回合结果预测模型。

Result: 在添加战术事件标签的数据集上训练模型，达到约81%的预测准确率，特别是在回合中后期阶段显著优于仅使用小地图信息的模型。

Conclusion: 利用比赛录像中的战术特征对于预测VALORANT回合结果非常有效，证明了战术分析在电竞预测中的重要性。

Abstract: Recently, research on predicting match outcomes in esports has been actively
conducted, but much of it is based on match log data and statistical
information. This research targets the FPS game VALORANT, which requires
complex strategies, and aims to build a round outcome prediction model by
analyzing minimap information in match footage. Specifically, based on the
video recognition model TimeSformer, we attempt to improve prediction accuracy
by incorporating detailed tactical features extracted from minimap information,
such as character position information and other in-game events. This paper
reports preliminary results showing that a model trained on a dataset augmented
with such tactical event labels achieved approximately 81% prediction accuracy,
especially from the middle phases of a round onward, significantly
outperforming a model trained on a dataset with the minimap information itself.
This suggests that leveraging tactical features from match footage is highly
effective for predicting round outcomes in VALORANT.

TL;DR: EndoCIL是一个专门为内窥镜图像诊断设计的类增量学习框架，通过分布对齐重放、先验正则化类别平衡损失和全连接梯度校准三个组件，有效缓解灾难性遗忘和类别不平衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 内窥镜图像分析需要持续适应新的临床数据，同时保持对已学习类别的性能。现有重放式类增量学习方法由于内窥镜图像中严重的领域差异和类别不平衡问题，无法有效缓解灾难性遗忘。

Method: 1. 最大均值差异重放：使用分布对齐的贪婪策略选择多样化和代表性样本；2. 先验正则化类别平衡损失：整合先验类别分布和平衡权重来缓解阶段间和阶段内类别不平衡；3. 全连接梯度校准：调整分类器梯度以减轻对新类别的偏见。

Result: 在四个公共内窥镜数据集上的广泛实验表明，EndoCIL在不同缓冲区大小和评估指标下通常优于最先进的类增量学习方法。

Conclusion: 该框架在终身内窥镜诊断中有效平衡了稳定性和可塑性，显示出良好的临床可扩展性和部署潜力。

Abstract: Class-incremental learning (CIL) for endoscopic image analysis is crucial for
real-world clinical applications, where diagnostic models should continuously
adapt to evolving clinical data while retaining performance on previously
learned ones. However, existing replay-based CIL methods fail to effectively
mitigate catastrophic forgetting due to severe domain discrepancies and class
imbalance inherent in endoscopic imaging. To tackle these challenges, we
propose EndoCIL, a novel and unified CIL framework specifically tailored for
endoscopic image diagnosis. EndoCIL incorporates three key components: Maximum
Mean Discrepancy Based Replay (MDBR), employing a distribution-aligned greedy
strategy to select diverse and representative exemplars, Prior Regularized
Class Balanced Loss (PRCBL), designed to alleviate both inter-phase and
intra-phase class imbalance by integrating prior class distributions and
balance weights into the loss function, and Calibration of Fully-Connected
Gradients (CFG), which adjusts the classifier gradients to mitigate bias toward
new classes. Extensive experiments conducted on four public endoscopic datasets
demonstrate that EndoCIL generally outperforms state-of-the-art CIL methods
across varying buffer sizes and evaluation metrics. The proposed framework
effectively balances stability and plasticity in lifelong endoscopic diagnosis,
showing promising potential for clinical scalability and deployment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人脸识别系统易受欺骗攻击，攻击者可能使用注册用户的照片绕过认证，因此需要在人脸识别前检测此类欺骗攻击。

Method: 使用带注册机制的DINOv2模型提取通用特征，抑制注意力机制中的扰动，专注于关键细微特征。

Result: 在ICCV2025第六届人脸反欺骗研讨会数据集和SiW数据集上的实验证明了该方法的有效性。

Conclusion: 基于DINOv2的活体检测方法能够有效检测欺骗攻击，提高人脸识别系统的安全性。

Abstract: Face recognition systems are designed to be robust against variations in head
pose, illumination, and image blur during capture. However, malicious actors
can exploit these systems by presenting a face photo of a registered user,
potentially bypassing the authentication process. Such spoofing attacks must be
detected prior to face recognition. In this paper, we propose a DINOv2-based
spoofing attack detection method to discern minute differences between live and
spoofed face images. Specifically, we employ DINOv2 with registers to extract
generalizable features and to suppress perturbations in the attention
mechanism, which enables focused attention on essential and minute features. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method through experiments
conducted on the dataset provided by ``The 6th Face Anti-Spoofing Workshop:
Unified Physical-Digital Attacks Detection@ICCV2025'' and SiW dataset.

TL;DR: 本文揭示了多模态大语言模型的三阶段跨模态交互过程，并提出了无需训练的剪枝框架VisiPruner，能显著减少视觉相关注意力计算和FLOPs。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在视觉语言任务中表现优异，但由于注意力计算的二次增长导致显著的计算开销。现有方法缺乏对MLLMs如何处理和融合多模态信息的基本理解。

Method: 通过系统分析发现三阶段跨模态交互过程，并基于此提出VisiPruner训练免费剪枝框架，在特定层阶段性地剪枝视觉token。

Result: VisiPruner在LLaVA-v1.5 7B上减少高达99%的视觉相关注意力计算和53.9%的FLOPs，显著优于现有token剪枝方法，并在多种MLLMs上具有通用性。

Conclusion: 研究不仅提供了高效的剪枝方法，还为训练高效MLLMs提供了可操作的指导原则，通过将模型架构与其内在的层间处理动态对齐。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have achieved strong performance
across vision-language tasks, but suffer from significant computational
overhead due to the quadratic growth of attention computations with the number
of multimodal tokens. Though efforts have been made to prune tokens in MLLMs,
\textit{they lack a fundamental understanding of how MLLMs process and fuse
multimodal information.} Through systematic analysis, we uncover a
\textbf{three-stage} cross-modal interaction process: (1) Shallow layers
recognize task intent, with visual tokens acting as passive attention sinks;
(2) Cross-modal fusion occurs abruptly in middle layers, driven by a few
critical visual tokens; (3) Deep layers discard vision tokens, focusing solely
on linguistic refinement. Based on these findings, we propose
\emph{VisiPruner}, a training-free pruning framework that reduces up to 99\% of
vision-related attention computations and 53.9\% of FLOPs on LLaVA-v1.5 7B. It
significantly outperforms existing token pruning methods and generalizes across
diverse MLLMs. Beyond pruning, our insights further provide actionable
guidelines for training efficient MLLMs by aligning model architecture with its
intrinsic layer-wise processing dynamics. Our code is available at:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有时刻检索方法主要关注单时刻检索，但现实应用中一个查询可能对应多个相关时刻，这使得现有数据集和方法不足以满足视频时序定位需求。

Method: 提出了FlashMMR框架，包含多时刻后验证模块来优化时刻边界，通过约束时序调整和验证模块重新评估候选片段，通过精细过滤管道修剪低置信度提议并实现鲁棒的多时刻对齐。

Result: 在QV-M²数据集上，FlashMMR相比之前SOTA方法在G-mAP上提升3.00%，在mAP@3+tgt上提升2.70%，在mR@3上提升2.56%。

Conclusion: 提出的基准和方法为推进更现实和具有挑战性的视频时序定位场景研究奠定了基础。

Abstract: Existing Moment retrieval (MR) methods focus on Single-Moment Retrieval
(SMR). However, one query can correspond to multiple relevant moments in
real-world applications. This makes the existing datasets and methods
insufficient for video temporal grounding. By revisiting the gap between
current MR tasks and real-world applications, we introduce a high-quality
datasets called QVHighlights Multi-Moment Dataset (QV-M$^2$), along with new
evaluation metrics tailored for multi-moment retrieval (MMR). QV-M$^2$ consists
of 2,212 annotations covering 6,384 video segments. Building on existing
efforts in MMR, we propose a framework called FlashMMR. Specifically, we
propose a Multi-moment Post-verification module to refine the moment
boundaries. We introduce constrained temporal adjustment and subsequently
leverage a verification module to re-evaluate the candidate segments. Through
this sophisticated filtering pipeline, low-confidence proposals are pruned, and
robust multi-moment alignment is achieved. We retrain and evaluate 6 existing
MR methods on QV-M$^2$ and QVHighlights under both SMR and MMR settings.
Results show that QV-M$^2$ serves as an effective benchmark for training and
evaluating MMR models, while FlashMMR provides a strong baseline. Specifically,
on QV-M$^2$, it achieves improvements over prior SOTA method by 3.00% on G-mAP,
2.70% on mAP@3+tgt, and 2.56% on mR@3. The proposed benchmark and method
establish a foundation for advancing research in more realistic and challenging
video temporal grounding scenarios. Code is released at

Conclusion: 所提出的公平感知深度伪造检测框架有效缓解了偏见问题，提高了检测可靠性和可解释性，为跨人口群体的公平检测提供了可行解决方案。

Abstract: Existing deepfake detection methods often exhibit bias, lack transparency,
and fail to capture temporal information, leading to biased decisions and
unreliable results across different demographic groups. In this paper, we
propose a fairness-aware deepfake detection framework that integrates temporal
feature learning and demographic-aware data augmentation to enhance fairness
and interpretability. Our method leverages sequence-based clustering for
temporal modeling of deepfake videos and concept extraction to improve
detection reliability while also facilitating interpretable decisions for
non-expert users. Additionally, we introduce a demography-aware data
augmentation method that balances underrepresented groups and applies
frequency-domain transformations to preserve deepfake artifacts, thereby
mitigating bias and improving generalization. Extensive experiments on
FaceForensics++, DFD, Celeb-DF, and DFDC datasets using state-of-the-art (SoTA)
architectures (Xception, ResNet) demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed
method in obtaining the best tradeoff between fairness and accuracy when
compared to SoTA.

Abstract: The advancement of vision-language models (VLMs) is hampered by a fragmented
landscape of inconsistent and contaminated public datasets. We introduce
FineVision, a meticulously collected, curated, and unified corpus of 24 million
samples - the largest open resource of its kind. We unify more than 200 sources
into 185 subsets via a semi-automated, human-in-the-loop pipeline: automation
performs bulk ingestion and schema mapping, while reviewers audit mappings and
spot-check outputs to verify faithful consumption of annotations, appropriate
formatting and diversity, and safety; issues trigger targeted fixes and
re-runs. The workflow further applies rigorous de-duplication within and across
sources and decontamination against 66 public benchmarks. FineVision also
encompasses agentic/GUI tasks with a unified action space; reviewers validate
schemas and inspect a sample of trajectories to confirm executable fidelity.
Models trained on FineVision consistently outperform those trained on existing
open mixtures across a broad evaluation suite, underscoring the benefits of
scale, data hygiene, and balanced automation with human oversight. We release
the corpus and curation tools to accelerate data-centric VLM research.

Conclusion: PnF方法通过自然语言描述复杂场景，能够快速适应目标行为，显著改善运动预测性能且无需微调，具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: Current autonomous driving systems rely on specialized models for perceiving
and predicting motion, which demonstrate reliable performance in standard
conditions. However, generalizing cost-effectively to diverse real-world
scenarios remains a significant challenge. To address this, we propose
Plug-and-Forecast (PnF), a plug-and-play approach that augments existing motion
forecasting models with multimodal large language models (MLLMs). PnF builds on
the insight that natural language provides a more effective way to describe and
handle complex scenarios, enabling quick adaptation to targeted behaviors. We
design prompts to extract structured scene understanding from MLLMs and distill
this information into learnable embeddings to augment existing behavior
prediction models. Our method leverages the zero-shot reasoning capabilities of
MLLMs to achieve significant improvements in motion prediction performance,
while requiring no fine-tuning -- making it practical to adopt. We validate our
approach on two state-of-the-art motion forecasting models using the Waymo Open
Motion Dataset and the nuScenes Dataset, demonstrating consistent performance
improvements across both benchmarks.

Abstract: Accurate segmentation and classification of white blood cells (WBCs) in
microscopic images are essential for diagnosis and monitoring of many
hematological disorders, yet remain challenging due to staining variability,
complex backgrounds, and class imbalance. In this paper, we introduce a novel
Saliency-Guided Cross-Layer Deep Feature Fusion framework (SG-CLDFF) that
tightly integrates saliency-driven preprocessing with multi-scale deep feature
aggregation to improve both robustness and interpretability for WBC analysis.
SG-CLDFF first computes saliency priors to highlight candidate WBC regions and
guide subsequent feature extraction. A lightweight hybrid backbone
(EfficientSwin-style) produces multi-resolution representations, which are
fused by a ResNeXt-CC-inspired cross-layer fusion module to preserve
complementary information from shallow and deep layers. The network is trained
in a multi-task setup with concurrent segmentation and cell-type classification
heads, using class-aware weighted losses and saliency-alignment regularization
to mitigate imbalance and suppress background activation. Interpretability is
enforced through Grad-CAM visualizations and saliency consistency checks,
allowing model decisions to be inspected at the regional level. We validate the
framework on standard public benchmarks (BCCD, LISC, ALL-IDB), reporting
consistent gains in IoU, F1, and classification accuracy compared to strong CNN
and transformer baselines. An ablation study also demonstrates the individual
contributions of saliency preprocessing and cross-layer fusion. SG-CLDFF offers
a practical and explainable path toward more reliable automated WBC analysis in
clinical workflows.

Abstract: Effortless and ergonomically designed surgical lighting is critical for
precision and safety during procedures. However, traditional systems often rely
on manual adjustments, leading to surgeon fatigue, neck strain, and
inconsistent illumination due to drift and shadowing. To address these
challenges, we propose a novel surgical lighting system that leverages the
YOLOv11 object detection algorithm to identify a blue marker placed above the
target surgical site. A high-power LED light source is then directed to the
identified location using two servomotors equipped with tilt-pan brackets. The
YOLO model achieves 96.7% mAP@50 on the validation set consisting of annotated
images simulating surgical scenes with the blue spherical marker. By automating
the lighting process, this machine vision-based solution reduces physical
strain on surgeons, improves consistency in illumination, and supports improved
surgical outcomes.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文发现自监督学习中存在一个反直觉现象：更长的训练时间可能损害密集预测任务的性能，称为自监督密集退化(SDD)。作者提出了密集表示结构估计器(DSE)来无监督评估密集任务性能，并基于此开发了模型选择策略和正则化方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 观察到自监督学习中，延长训练时间反而会损害密集预测任务（如语义分割）的性能，这种现象在16种最先进的自监督学习方法中普遍存在。由于缺乏有效的无监督评估方法，需要开发一种能够准确评估密集任务性能的指标。

Method: 提出了密集表示结构估计器(DSE)，包含类相关性度量和有效维度度量。基于DSE开发了模型选择策略和正则化方法，用于缓解自监督密集退化问题。

Result: 在16种自监督方法和4个基准测试上的实验表明，模型选择策略平均提升mIoU 3.0%，计算成本可忽略。DSE正则化方法能持续缓解密集退化效应。

Conclusion: 自监督密集退化是自监督学习中普遍存在的现象，提出的DSE指标能有效评估密集任务性能，基于DSE的模型选择和正则化方法能显著改善下游任务表现。

Abstract: In this work, we observe a counterintuitive phenomenon in self-supervised
learning (SSL): longer training may impair the performance of dense prediction
tasks (e.g., semantic segmentation). We refer to this phenomenon as
Self-supervised Dense Degradation (SDD) and demonstrate its consistent presence
across sixteen state-of-the-art SSL methods with various losses, architectures,
and datasets. When the model performs suboptimally on dense tasks at the end of
training, measuring the performance during training becomes essential. However,
evaluating dense performance effectively without annotations remains an open
challenge. To tackle this issue, we introduce a Dense representation Structure
Estimator (DSE), composed of a class-relevance measure and an effective
dimensionality measure. The proposed DSE is both theoretically grounded and
empirically validated to be closely correlated with the downstream performance.
Based on this metric, we introduce a straightforward yet effective model
selection strategy and a DSE-based regularization method. Experiments on
sixteen SSL methods across four benchmarks confirm that model selection
improves mIoU by $3.0\%$ on average with negligible computational cost.
Additionally, DSE regularization consistently mitigates the effects of dense
degradation. Code is available at

### [133] [CausalMamba: Scalable Conditional State Space Models for Neural Causal Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17318)
*Sangyoon Bae,Jiook Cha*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CausalMamba是一个可扩展的fMRI因果推断框架，通过两阶段方法解决血氧水平依赖信号失真和计算复杂性问题，在模拟数据上比DCM准确率高37%，在真实数据中能恢复88%的已知神经通路。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决fMRI因果推断中的基本限制：从血流动力学失真的BOLD信号推断神经因果关系的病态性质，以及现有方法（如动态因果建模DCM）的计算不可行性。

Method: 将复杂逆问题分解为两个可处理阶段：BOLD反卷积恢复潜在神经活动，然后使用新颖的条件Mamba架构进行因果图推断。

Result: 在模拟数据上比DCM准确率高37%；在真实任务fMRI数据中，恢复88%的已知神经通路，而传统方法在99%以上的受试者中无法识别这些典型回路；工作记忆数据的网络分析显示大脑根据刺激策略性地转移主要因果枢纽。

Conclusion: 为神经科学家提供了实用的工具，用于大规模因果推断，捕捉认知功能背后的基本回路模式和灵活网络动态。

Abstract: We introduce CausalMamba, a scalable framework that addresses fundamental
limitations in fMRI-based causal inference: the ill-posed nature of inferring
neural causality from hemodynamically distorted BOLD signals and the
computational intractability of existing methods like Dynamic Causal Modeling
(DCM). Our approach decomposes this complex inverse problem into two tractable
stages: BOLD deconvolution to recover latent neural activity, followed by
causal graph inference using a novel Conditional Mamba architecture. On
simulated data, CausalMamba achieves 37% higher accuracy than DCM. Critically,
when applied to real task fMRI data, our method recovers well-established
neural pathways with 88% fidelity, whereas conventional approaches fail to
identify these canonical circuits in over 99% of subjects. Furthermore, our
network analysis of working memory data reveals that the brain strategically
shifts its primary causal hub-recruiting executive or salience networks
depending on the stimulus-a sophisticated reconfiguration that remains
undetected by traditional methods. This work provides neuroscientists with a
practical tool for large-scale causal inference that captures both fundamental
circuit motifs and flexible network dynamics underlying cognitive function.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文评估了现有对抗性防御方法对覆盖人体大面积区域的对抗性衣物的防御效果，发现这些防御方法在数字和物理世界中表现均不佳，揭示了现有防御方法的共同脆弱性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 实验发现简单增大对抗性补丁的尺寸就能使现有防御方法失效，因此需要评估防御方法对具有大面积覆盖的对抗性衣物的防御能力。

Method: 通过制作对抗性衣物，在数字世界和物理世界中测试多种防御方法的效果，并针对Faster R-CNN制作能够突破多种防御方法的单一衣物集。

Result: 所有防御方法在对抗性衣物面前表现都很差，制作的单一衣物集在物理世界中对抗未防御检测器的攻击成功率达到96.06%，对抗九个防御模型的攻击成功率均超过64.84%。

Conclusion: 现有对抗性防御方法在面对大面积覆盖的对抗性衣物时存在共同脆弱性，需要开发更有效的防御策略。

Abstract: In recent years, adversarial attacks against deep learning-based object
detectors in the physical world have attracted much attention. To defend
against these attacks, researchers have proposed various defense methods
against adversarial patches, a typical form of physically-realizable attack.
However, our experiments showed that simply enlarging the patch size could make
these defense methods fail. Motivated by this, we evaluated various defense
methods against adversarial clothes which have large coverage over the human
body. Adversarial clothes provide a good test case for adversarial defense
against patch-based attacks because they not only have large sizes but also
look more natural than a large patch on humans. Experiments show that all the
defense methods had poor performance against adversarial clothes in both the
digital world and the physical world. In addition, we crafted a single set of
clothes that broke multiple defense methods on Faster R-CNN. The set achieved
an Attack Success Rate (ASR) of 96.06% against the undefended detector and over
64.84% ASRs against nine defended models in the physical world, unveiling the
common vulnerability of existing adversarial defense methods against
adversarial clothes. Code is available at:

TL;DR: 提出CharDiff框架，通过字符级引导的扩散模型有效恢复和识别严重退化的车牌图像，在恢复质量和识别精度上显著优于基线模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 车牌图像恢复不仅对LPR系统预处理很重要，还能提高证据价值、增强视觉界面清晰度，并促进车牌图像的进一步利用。

Method: 使用基于扩散的框架，通过外部分割和OCR模块提取细粒度字符级先验，并引入CHARM模块确保每个字符的引导仅限于其自身区域。

Result: 在Roboflow-LP数据集上，相比性能最佳的基线模型，CER相对降低了28%，在恢复质量和识别精度方面均显著优于基线模型。

Conclusion: 结构化字符引导条件化有效增强了基于扩散的车牌恢复和识别在实际部署场景中的鲁棒性。

Abstract: The significance of license plate image restoration goes beyond the
preprocessing stage of License Plate Recognition (LPR) systems, as it also
serves various purposes, including increasing evidential value, enhancing the
clarity of visual interface, and facilitating further utilization of license
plate images. We propose a novel diffusion-based framework with character-level
guidance, CharDiff, which effectively restores and recognizes severely degraded
license plate images captured under realistic conditions. CharDiff leverages
fine-grained character-level priors extracted through external segmentation and
Optical Character Recognition (OCR) modules tailored for low-quality license
plate images. For precise and focused guidance, CharDiff incorporates a novel
Character-guided Attention through Region-wise Masking (CHARM) module, which
ensures that each character's guidance is restricted to its own region, thereby
avoiding interference with other regions. In experiments, CharDiff
significantly outperformed the baseline restoration models in both restoration
quality and recognition accuracy, achieving a 28% relative reduction in CER on
the Roboflow-LP dataset, compared to the best-performing baseline model. These
results indicate that the structured character-guided conditioning effectively
enhances the robustness of diffusion-based license plate restoration and
recognition in practical deployment scenarios.

Abstract: Image Quality Assessment (IQA) has progressed from scalar quality prediction
to more interpretable, human-aligned evaluation paradigms. In this work, we
address the emerging challenge of detailed and explainable IQA by proposing
iDETEX-a unified multimodal large language model (MLLM) capable of
simultaneously performing three key tasks: quality grounding, perception, and
description. To facilitate efficient and generalizable training across these
heterogeneous subtasks, we design a suite of task-specific offline augmentation
modules and a data mixing strategy. These are further complemented by online
enhancement strategies to fully exploit multi-sourced supervision. We validate
our approach on the large-scale ViDA-UGC benchmark, where iDETEX achieves
state-of-the-art performance across all subtasks. Our model ranks first in the
ICCV MIPI 2025 Detailed Image Quality Assessment Challenge, demonstrating its
effectiveness and robustness in delivering accurate and interpretable quality
assessments.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于后处理的开放集识别方法，通过比较模型特征和预测logits之间的一致性来识别未知类别，无需重新训练预训练模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的野生动物分类模型在封闭世界设定下训练，当遇到未知类别时会过度自信。现有OSR方法大多需要重新训练模型，这限制了实际应用。

Method: 提出基于最近类均值(NCM)的概率分布，并将其与softmax概率进行比较，衡量NCM和分类头之间的一致性。这是一种后处理方法，无需重新训练预训练模型。

Result: 在两个数据集上均排名前三，表现稳定。在非洲和瑞典动物数据集上分别达到93.41和95.35的AUROC分数，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 该方法提供了一种有效的后处理OSR策略，无需模型重训练，在多个数据集上表现一致且优于现有方法。

Abstract: Current state-of-the-art Wildlife classification models are trained under the
closed world setting. When exposed to unknown classes, they remain
overconfident in their predictions. Open-set Recognition (OSR) aims to classify
known classes while rejecting unknown samples. Several OSR methods have been
proposed to model the closed-set distribution by observing the feature, logit,
or softmax probability space. A significant drawback of many existing
approaches is the requirement to retrain the pre-trained classification model
with the OSR-specific strategy. This study contributes a post-processing OSR
method that measures the agreement between the models' features and predicted
logits. We propose a probability distribution based on an input's distance to
its Nearest Class Mean (NCM). The NCM-based distribution is then compared with
the softmax probabilities from the logit space to measure agreement between the
NCM and the classification head. Our proposed strategy ranks within the top
three on two evaluated datasets, showing consistent performance across the two
datasets. In contrast, current state-of-the-art methods excel on a single
dataset. We achieve an AUROC of 93.41 and 95.35 for African and Swedish
animals. The code can be found

### [138] [Exploring The Missing Semantics In Event Modality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17347)
*Jingqian Wu,Shengpeng Xu,Yunbo Jia,Edmund Y. Lam*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出Semantic-E2VID框架，通过跨模态特征对齐和语义感知特征融合，将视觉语义知识从帧模态转移到事件模态，显著提升了事件到视频重建的质量和语义信息恢复能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 事件相机虽然具有低延迟、高动态范围等优势，但由于仅捕获强度变化而忽略静态对象和背景，导致事件模态缺乏语义信息。现有事件到视频重建方法往往忽视语义信息的重要性，这限制了重建视频的质量。

Method: 1) 跨模态特征对齐模块：将Segment Anything Model的视觉语义知识转移到事件编码器；2) 语义感知特征融合块：将学习到的语义特征整合到事件表示中；3) 语义感知E2V监督：利用SAM生成的类别标签来促进语义细节的重建。

Result: 在多个基准测试中，Semantic-E2VID显著提升了帧质量，优于最先进的事件到视频重建方法。

Conclusion: 通过引入视觉语义知识，Semantic-E2VID有效解决了事件模态缺乏语义信息的问题，为事件到视频重建任务提供了新的解决方案。

Abstract: Event cameras offer distinct advantages such as low latency, high dynamic
range, and efficient motion capture. However, event-to-video reconstruction
(E2V), a fundamental event-based vision task, remains challenging, particularly
for reconstructing and recovering semantic information. This is primarily due
to the nature of the event camera, as it only captures intensity changes,
ignoring static objects and backgrounds, resulting in a lack of semantic
information in captured event modality. Further, semantic information plays a
crucial role in video and frame reconstruction, yet is often overlooked by
existing E2V approaches. To bridge this gap, we propose Semantic-E2VID, an E2V
framework that explores the missing visual semantic knowledge in event modality
and leverages it to enhance event-to-video reconstruction. Specifically,
Semantic-E2VID introduces a cross-modal feature alignment (CFA) module to
transfer the robust visual semantics from a frame-based vision foundation
model, the Segment Anything Model (SAM), to the event encoder, while aligning
the high-level features from distinct modalities. To better utilize the learned
semantic feature, we further propose a semantic-aware feature fusion (SFF)
block to integrate learned semantics in frame modality to form event
representations with rich semantics that can be decoded by the event decoder.
Further, to facilitate the reconstruction of semantic information, we propose a
novel Semantic Perceptual E2V Supervision that helps the model to reconstruct
semantic details by leveraging SAM-generated categorical labels. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that Semantic-E2VID significantly enhances frame
quality, outperforming state-of-the-art E2V methods across multiple benchmarks.
The sample code is included in the supplementary material.

Result: 在NYUDv2数据集上超越最先进的多任务模型，在Hypersim上超过单任务深度和语义基线，在Cityscapes上表现优异，且在笔记本电脑硬件上保持计算效率。

Conclusion: M2H作为单目空间感知系统的基础，支持动态环境中的3D场景图构建，并在实际数据验证中展示了实用性。

Abstract: Deploying real-time spatial perception on edge devices requires efficient
multi-task models that leverage complementary task information while minimizing
computational overhead. This paper introduces Multi-Mono-Hydra (M2H), a novel
multi-task learning framework designed for semantic segmentation and depth,
edge, and surface normal estimation from a single monocular image. Unlike
conventional approaches that rely on independent single-task models or shared
encoder-decoder architectures, M2H introduces a Window-Based Cross-Task
Attention Module that enables structured feature exchange while preserving
task-specific details, improving prediction consistency across tasks. Built on
a lightweight ViT-based DINOv2 backbone, M2H is optimized for real-time
deployment and serves as the foundation for monocular spatial perception
systems supporting 3D scene graph construction in dynamic environments.
Comprehensive evaluations show that M2H outperforms state-of-the-art multi-task
models on NYUDv2, surpasses single-task depth and semantic baselines on
Hypersim, and achieves superior performance on the Cityscapes dataset, all
while maintaining computational efficiency on laptop hardware. Beyond
benchmarks, M2H is validated on real-world data, demonstrating its practicality
in spatial perception tasks.

Result: 在流式视频基准测试中达到最先进性能，在效率和效果之间取得良好平衡

Conclusion: 该方法为视频大语言模型在流式场景中的应用提供了有效的解决方案，显著提升了处理效率而不牺牲性能

Abstract: Video Large Language Models (Video-LLMs) excel at understanding videos
in-context, provided they have full access to the video when answering queries.
However, these models face challenges in streaming scenarios where hour-long
videos must be processed online, and questions need timely responses. In this
work, we propose a training-free approach compatible with standard Video-LLMs,
leveraging three key concepts: 1) LLM-informed selection of visual tokens to
identify those that the LLM has attended to and contributed to its
understanding of each short clip. Our attention-based selection allows us to
discard up to ~95% of unimportant visual tokens with minimal performance loss;
2) Recurrent processing of past selected tokens to generate temporally coherent
understanding of each processed clip; 3) Caption-based question answering for
lightweight and accurate responses. Our method achieves state-of-the-art
performance on streaming video benchmarks, striking a balance between
efficiency and effectiveness.

Result: 最佳合成数据集VariFace和VIGFace准确率分别达95.67%和94.91%，超过CASIA-WebFace等真实数据集，同时提供前所未有的偏见控制能力。

Conclusion: 合成人脸数据是科学可行且伦理必要的替代方案，为面部识别研究提供了隐私保护的新途径。

Abstract: The deployment of facial recognition systems has created an ethical dilemma:
achieving high accuracy requires massive datasets of real faces collected
without consent, leading to dataset retractions and potential legal liabilities
under regulations like GDPR. While synthetic facial data presents a promising
privacy-preserving alternative, the field lacks comprehensive empirical
evidence of its viability. This study addresses this critical gap through
extensive evaluation of synthetic facial recognition datasets. We present a
systematic literature review identifying 25 synthetic facial recognition
datasets (2018-2025), combined with rigorous experimental validation. Our
methodology examines seven key requirements for privacy-preserving synthetic
data: identity leakage prevention, intra-class variability, identity
separability, dataset scale, ethical data sourcing, bias mitigation, and
benchmark reliability. Through experiments involving over 10 million synthetic
samples, extended by a comparison of results reported on five standard
benchmarks, we provide the first comprehensive empirical assessment of
synthetic data's capability to replace real datasets. Best-performing synthetic
datasets (VariFace, VIGFace) achieve recognition accuracies of 95.67% and
94.91% respectively, surpassing established real datasets including
CASIA-WebFace (94.70%). While those images remain private, publicly available
alternatives Vec2Face (93.52%) and CemiFace (93.22%) come close behind. Our
findings reveal that they ensure proper intra-class variability while
maintaining identity separability. Demographic bias analysis shows that, even
though synthetic data inherits limited biases, it offers unprecedented control
for bias mitigation through generation parameters. These results establish
synthetic facial data as a scientifically viable and ethically imperative
alternative for facial recognition research.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于多面部表情特征的帕金森病严重程度诊断方法，通过注意力机制融合特征并采用自适应类别平衡策略解决类别不平衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于面部表情的PD诊断方法依赖单一表情类型易导致误诊，且忽略不同PD阶段的类别不平衡问题，大多仅进行二元分类而非严重程度诊断。

Method: 集成多种面部表情特征通过注意力机制进行特征融合，并采用自适应类别平衡策略根据类别分布和分类难度动态调整训练样本贡献。

Result: 实验结果表明该方法在PD严重程度诊断方面表现优异，注意力特征融合和自适应类别平衡策略有效。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效诊断帕金森病严重程度，解决了现有方法的局限性，为PD早期检测和个性化干预提供了有力工具。

Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD) severity diagnosis is crucial for early detecting
potential patients and adopting tailored interventions. Diagnosing PD based on
facial expression is grounded in PD patients' "masked face" symptom and gains
growing interest recently for its convenience and affordability. However,
current facial expression-based approaches often rely on single type of
expression which can lead to misdiagnosis, and ignore the class imbalance
across different PD stages which degrades the prediction performance. Moreover,
most existing methods focus on binary classification (i.e., PD / non-PD) rather
than diagnosing the severity of PD. To address these issues, we propose a new
facial expression-based method for PD severity diagnosis which integrates
multiple facial expression features through attention-based feature fusion.
Moreover, we mitigate the class imbalance problem via an adaptive class
balancing strategy which dynamically adjusts the contribution of training
samples based on their class distribution and classification difficulty.
Experimental results demonstrate the promising performance of the proposed
method for PD severity diagnosis, as well as the efficacy of attention-based
feature fusion and adaptive class balancing.

Conclusion: LoopTrans通过双向知识转移框架有效提升了弱监督功能基础任务的性能，证明了闭环知识转移在复杂交互场景中的优势

Abstract: Humans can perform previously unexperienced interactions with novel objects
simply by observing others engage with them. Weakly-supervised affordance
grounding mimics this process by learning to locate object regions that enable
actions on egocentric images, using exocentric interaction images with
image-level annotations. However, extracting affordance knowledge solely from
exocentric images and transferring it one-way to egocentric images limits the
applicability of previous works in complex interaction scenarios. Instead, this
study introduces LoopTrans, a novel closed-loop framework that not only
transfers knowledge from exocentric to egocentric but also transfers back to
enhance exocentric knowledge extraction. Within LoopTrans, several innovative
mechanisms are introduced, including unified cross-modal localization and
denoising knowledge distillation, to bridge domain gaps between object-centered
egocentric and interaction-centered exocentric images while enhancing knowledge
transfer. Experiments show that LoopTrans achieves consistent improvements
across all metrics on image and video benchmarks, even handling challenging
scenarios where object interaction regions are fully occluded by the human
body.

Abstract: Monitoring the behavior of stalled horses is essential for early detection of
health and welfare issues but remains labor-intensive and time-consuming. In
this study, we present a prototype vision-based monitoring system that
automates the detection and tracking of horses and people inside stables using
object detection and multi-object tracking techniques. The system leverages
YOLOv11 and BoT-SORT for detection and tracking, while event states are
inferred based on object trajectories and spatial relations within the stall.
To support development, we constructed a custom dataset annotated with
assistance from foundation models CLIP and GroundingDINO. The system
distinguishes between five event types and accounts for the camera's blind
spots. Qualitative evaluation demonstrated reliable performance for
horse-related events, while highlighting limitations in detecting people due to
data scarcity. This work provides a foundation for real-time behavioral
monitoring in equine facilities, with implications for animal welfare and
stable management.

TL;DR: DeepDetect是一个智能、全功能的密集关键点检测器，通过融合传统检测器的优势，使用深度学习生成高密度、高重复性的关键点，在视觉退化条件下表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统关键点检测器（SIFT、SURF等）和学习方法（SuperPoint等）存在对光度变化敏感、关键点密度低、重复性差、适应性有限以及缺乏语义理解等问题，无法优先处理视觉重要区域。

Method: 首先融合7种关键点检测器和2种边缘检测器的输出创建真实标签掩码，提取多样视觉特征；然后使用轻量高效的ESPNet模型，以这些掩码作为标签进行训练，使DeepDetect能够语义关注图像并生成密集关键点。

Result: 在Oxford Affine Covariant Regions数据集上的评估显示，DeepDetect在关键点密度（0.5143）、重复性（0.9582）和正确匹配数（59,003）方面均超过其他检测器，达到最大值。

Conclusion: DeepDetect通过融合传统检测器的多样视觉线索和深度学习能力，实现了在多样化视觉退化条件下生成高密度、高重复性关键点的突破性性能。

Abstract: Keypoint detection is the foundation of many computer vision tasks, including
image registration, structure-from motion, 3D reconstruction, visual odometry,
and SLAM. Traditional detectors (SIFT, SURF, ORB, BRISK, etc.) and learning
based methods (SuperPoint, R2D2, LF-Net, D2-Net, etc.) have shown strong
performance yet suffer from key limitations: sensitivity to photometric
changes, low keypoint density and repeatability, limited adaptability to
challenging scenes, and lack of semantic understanding, often failing to
prioritize visually important regions. We present DeepDetect, an intelligent,
all-in-one, dense keypoint detector that unifies the strengths of classical
detectors using deep learning. Firstly, we create ground-truth masks by fusing
outputs of 7 keypoint and 2 edge detectors, extracting diverse visual cues from
corners and blobs to prominent edges and textures in the images. Afterwards, a
lightweight and efficient model: ESPNet, is trained using these masks as
labels, enabling DeepDetect to focus semantically on images while producing
highly dense keypoints, that are adaptable to diverse and visually degraded
conditions. Evaluations on the Oxford Affine Covariant Regions dataset
demonstrate that DeepDetect surpasses other detectors in keypoint density,
repeatability, and the number of correct matches, achieving maximum values of
0.5143 (average keypoint density), 0.9582 (average repeatability), and 59,003
(correct matches).

Method: 重新利用AV1运动向量来生成密集亚像素对应关系，并通过余弦一致性过滤短轨迹。

Result: 在117帧视频上，运动向量匹配注册了所有图像并重建了46-62万个点，重投影误差为0.51-0.53像素；BA时间随匹配密度增加而增长。

Conclusion: 压缩域对应关系是一个实用且资源高效的前端解决方案，具有在完整流程中扩展的清晰路径。

Abstract: We repurpose AV1 motion vectors to produce dense sub-pixel correspondences
and short tracks filtered by cosine consistency. On short videos, this
compressed-domain front end runs comparably to sequential SIFT while using far
less CPU, and yields denser matches with competitive pairwise geometry. As a
small SfM demo on a 117-frame clip, MV matches register all images and
reconstruct 0.46-0.62M points at 0.51-0.53,px reprojection error; BA time grows
with match density. These results show compressed-domain correspondences are a
practical, resource-efficient front end with clear paths to scaling in full
pipelines.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一个高质量夜间图像去雨基准数据集HQ-NightRain，并开发了颜色空间转换网络CST-Net，通过可学习的颜色空间转换器和隐式光照引导来有效去除夜间复杂雨纹。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 夜间图像去雨面临比白天更大的挑战，主要由于夜间场景的复杂性和缺乏高质量数据集来准确表示雨和光照的耦合效应。

Method: 提出CST-Net网络，包含可学习的颜色空间转换器(CSC)将图像转换到Y通道进行雨纹去除，并引入隐式光照引导来提升模型在复杂场景下的鲁棒性。

Result: 大量实验验证了所提数据集的价值和方法的有效性，在夜间图像去雨任务上表现出色。

Conclusion: HQ-NightRain数据集和CST-Net方法为夜间图像去雨任务提供了高质量的基准和有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Compared to daytime image deraining, nighttime image deraining poses
significant challenges due to inherent complexities of nighttime scenarios and
the lack of high-quality datasets that accurately represent the coupling effect
between rain and illumination. In this paper, we rethink the task of nighttime
image deraining and contribute a new high-quality benchmark, HQ-NightRain,
which offers higher harmony and realism compared to existing datasets. In
addition, we develop an effective Color Space Transformation Network (CST-Net)
for better removing complex rain from nighttime scenes. Specifically, we
propose a learnable color space converter (CSC) to better facilitate rain
removal in the Y channel, as nighttime rain is more pronounced in the Y channel
compared to the RGB color space. To capture illumination information for
guiding nighttime deraining, implicit illumination guidance is introduced
enabling the learned features to improve the model's robustness in complex
scenarios. Extensive experiments show the value of our dataset and the
effectiveness of our method. The source code and datasets are available at

*Feng Zhou,Wenkai Guo,Pu Cao,Zhicheng Zhang,Jianqin Yin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种改进稀疏视图3D高斯溅射初始化的方法，通过频率感知SfM、3DGS自初始化和点云正则化来提升稀疏视图下的3D重建质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 稀疏视图下的3D高斯溅射容易过拟合训练视图，导致新视角渲染出现模糊等伪影。现有方法要么增强初始化，要么添加训练时约束，但作者发现初始化是决定性因素。

Method: 设计了三个组件：(1)频率感知SfM通过低频视图增强和宽松多视角对应改善低纹理区域覆盖；(2)3DGS自初始化将光度监督提升为额外点，补偿SfM稀疏区域；(3)点云正则化通过几何/可见性先验确保多视角一致性和均匀空间覆盖。

Result: 在LLFF和Mip-NeRF360数据集上的实验表明，该方法在稀疏视图设置下取得了持续的性能提升。

Conclusion: 该方法作为一种更强的初始化策略，有效解决了稀疏视图3D高斯溅射的过拟合问题。

Abstract: Sparse-view 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) often overfits to the training
views, leading to artifacts like blurring in novel view rendering. Prior work
addresses it either by enhancing the initialization (\emph{i.e.}, the point
cloud from Structure-from-Motion (SfM)) or by adding training-time constraints
(regularization) to the 3DGS optimization. Yet our controlled ablations reveal
that initialization is the decisive factor: it determines the attainable
performance band in sparse-view 3DGS, while training-time constraints yield
only modest within-band improvements at extra cost. Given initialization's
primacy, we focus our design there. Although SfM performs poorly under sparse
views due to its reliance on feature matching, it still provides reliable seed
points. Thus, building on SfM, our effort aims to supplement the regions it
fails to cover as comprehensively as possible. Specifically, we design: (i)
frequency-aware SfM that improves low-texture coverage via low-frequency view
augmentation and relaxed multi-view correspondences; (ii) 3DGS
self-initialization that lifts photometric supervision into additional points,
compensating SfM-sparse regions with learned Gaussian centers; and (iii)
point-cloud regularization that enforces multi-view consistency and uniform
spatial coverage through simple geometric/visibility priors, yielding a clean
and reliable point cloud. Our experiments on LLFF and Mip-NeRF360 demonstrate
consistent gains in sparse-view settings, establishing our approach as a
stronger initialization strategy. Code is available at

Motivation: 现有占用世界模型依赖静态固定嵌入或网格，限制了感知灵活性，且其网格内分类方法与真实场景的动态连续性存在潜在不匹配。

Method: 提出Range-Adaptive Perception模块（可学习查询通过自车状态调制并增强时空关联）和State-Conditioned Forecasting模块（用回归引导公式替代基于分类的预测），并设计Temporal-Aware Self-Scheduling训练策略。

Result: 在感知、预测和规划任务上达到最先进性能，验证了模型在灵活性、适应性和效率方面的优势。

Conclusion: SparseWorld通过稀疏动态查询成功解决了现有占用世界模型的局限性，实现了对4D环境的精确建模。

Abstract: Semantic occupancy has emerged as a powerful representation in world models
for its ability to capture rich spatial semantics. However, most existing
occupancy world models rely on static and fixed embeddings or grids, which
inherently limit the flexibility of perception. Moreover, their ``in-place
classification" over grids exhibits a potential misalignment with the dynamic
and continuous nature of real scenarios.In this paper, we propose SparseWorld,
a novel 4D occupancy world model that is flexible, adaptive, and efficient,
powered by sparse and dynamic queries. We propose a Range-Adaptive Perception
module, in which learnable queries are modulated by the ego vehicle states and
enriched with temporal-spatial associations to enable extended-range
perception. To effectively capture the dynamics of the scene, we design a
State-Conditioned Forecasting module, which replaces classification-based
forecasting with regression-guided formulation, precisely aligning the dynamic
queries with the continuity of the 4D environment. In addition, We specifically
devise a Temporal-Aware Self-Scheduling training strategy to enable smooth and
efficient training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SparseWorld achieves
state-of-the-art performance across perception, forecasting, and planning
tasks. Comprehensive visualizations and ablation studies further validate the
advantages of SparseWorld in terms of flexibility, adaptability, and
efficiency. The code is available at https://github.com/MSunDYY/SparseWorld.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: AutoSOD是一个无监督显著目标检测方法，通过POTNet生成高质量伪掩码来训练标准编码器-解码器，无需像素级标注即可达到接近监督方法的准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 显著目标检测是计算机视觉的基础任务，作者认为无需像素级标签也能达到接近监督方法的精度，但前提是能获得可靠的伪掩码。

Method: 提出POTNet，改进原型最优传输方法：使用熵引导的双聚类头，高熵像素用谱聚类，低熵像素用k-means，然后通过最优传输对齐两个原型集，生成更清晰的伪掩码。

Result: 在五个基准测试上，AutoSOD比无监督方法F-measure提升26%，比弱监督方法提升36%，进一步缩小了与全监督模型的差距。

Conclusion: 通过改进原型生成和最优传输对齐，AutoSOD实现了端到端的无监督显著目标检测，在准确率和训练效率上都优于现有方法。

Abstract: Salient object detection (SOD) aims to segment visually prominent regions in
images and serves as a foundational task for various computer vision
applications. We posit that SOD can now reach near-supervised accuracy without
a single pixel-level label, but only when reliable pseudo-masks are available.
We revisit the prototype-based line of work and make two key observations.
First, boundary pixels and interior pixels obey markedly different geometry;
second, the global consistency enforced by optimal transport (OT) is
underutilized if prototype quality is weak. To address this, we introduce
POTNet, an adaptation of Prototypical Optimal Transport that replaces POT's
single k-means step with an entropy-guided dual-clustering head: high-entropy
pixels are organized by spectral clustering, low-entropy pixels by k-means, and
the two prototype sets are subsequently aligned by OT. This
split-fuse-transport design yields sharper, part-aware pseudo-masks in a single
forward pass, without handcrafted priors. Those masks supervise a standard
MaskFormer-style encoder-decoder, giving rise to AutoSOD, an end-to-end
unsupervised SOD pipeline that eliminates SelfMask's offline voting yet
improves both accuracy and training efficiency. Extensive experiments on five
benchmarks show that AutoSOD outperforms unsupervised methods by up to 26% and
weakly supervised methods by up to 36% in F-measure, further narrowing the gap
to fully supervised models.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于评分标准的伪标签提示框架，将少量真实标注转化为高置信度伪标签，指导LLM进行可解释的场景评估，在零样本设置下实现接近监督方法的视频摘要性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有监督方法标注成本高且跨数据集泛化能力有限，无监督方法难以捕捉高级语义和细粒度叙事线索，零样本提示方法对人工模板和数据集特定评分归一化敏感。

Method: 使用评分标准引导的伪标签提示框架，将少量真实标注转化为结构化评分标准，在推理时对首尾片段基于描述评分，中间片段结合相邻场景上下文评估叙事进展和冗余度。

Result: 在SumMe和TVSum数据集上分别达到57.58和63.05的F1分数，超越无监督和先前零样本基线，接近监督方法性能。

Conclusion: 评分标准引导的伪标签能有效稳定基于LLM的评分，为视频摘要建立了一个通用、可解释的零样本范式。

Abstract: With the rapid proliferation of video content across social media,
surveillance, and education platforms, efficiently summarizing long videos into
concise yet semantically faithful surrogates has become increasingly vital.
Existing supervised methods achieve strong in-domain accuracy by learning from
dense annotations but suffer from high labeling costs and limited cross-dataset
generalization, while unsupervised approaches, though label-free, often fail to
capture high-level human semantics and fine-grained narrative cues. More
recently, zero-shot prompting pipelines have leveraged large language models
(LLMs) for training-free video summarization, yet remain highly sensitive to
handcrafted prompt templates and dataset-specific score normalization. To
overcome these limitations, we introduce a rubric-guided, pseudo-labeled
prompting framework that transforms a small subset of ground-truth annotations
into high-confidence pseudo labels, which are aggregated into structured,
dataset-adaptive scoring rubrics guiding interpretable scene evaluation. During
inference, first and last segments are scored based solely on their
descriptions, whereas intermediate ones incorporate brief contextual summaries
of adjacent scenes to assess narrative progression and redundancy. This
contextual prompting enables the LLM to balance local salience and global
coherence without parameter tuning. On SumMe and TVSum, our method achieves F1
scores of \textbf{57.58} and \textbf{63.05}, surpassing unsupervised and prior
zero-shot baselines while approaching supervised performance. The results
demonstrate that rubric-guided pseudo labeling effectively stabilizes LLM-based
scoring and establishes a general, interpretable zero-shot paradigm for video
summarization.

Conclusion: 该框架显著提升了视频生成模型的训练效率和性能，开源的技术栈为社区提供了首个基于Megatron-Core的大规模视频生成训练代码。

Abstract: In recent years, large-scale generative models for visual content
(\textit{e.g.,} images, videos, and 3D objects/scenes) have made remarkable
progress. However, training large-scale video generation models remains
particularly challenging and resource-intensive due to cross-modal text-video
alignment, the long sequences involved, and the complex spatiotemporal
dependencies. To address these challenges, we present a training framework that
optimizes four pillars: (i) data processing, (ii) model architecture, (iii)
training strategy, and (iv) infrastructure for large-scale video generation
models. These optimizations delivered significant efficiency gains and
performance improvements across all stages of data preprocessing, video
compression, parameter scaling, curriculum-based pretraining, and
alignment-focused post-training. Our resulting model, MUG-V 10B, matches recent
state-of-the-art video generators overall and, on e-commerce-oriented video
generation tasks, surpasses leading open-source baselines in human evaluations.
More importantly, we open-source the complete stack, including model weights,
Megatron-Core-based large-scale training code, and inference pipelines for
video generation and enhancement. To our knowledge, this is the first public
release of large-scale video generation training code that exploits
Megatron-Core to achieve high training efficiency and near-linear multi-node
scaling, details are available in

TL;DR: 提出MambaX-Net用于前列腺癌主动监测中的纵向分割，通过结合历史MRI和分割掩码，使用Mamba增强的交叉注意力模块和形状提取器，在半监督设置下实现准确的前列腺区域分割。

Motivation: 解决现有深度学习分割模型在纵向主动监测分析中的局限性，这些模型通常基于单时间点和专家标注数据训练，无法有效处理多时间点和专家标注稀缺的情况。

Conclusion: MambaX-Net为前列腺癌主动监测提供了一种有效的纵向分割解决方案，能够利用历史信息在半监督设置下实现准确分割，解决了现有方法在纵向分析中的局限性。

Abstract: Active Surveillance (AS) is a treatment option for managing low and
intermediate-risk prostate cancer (PCa), aiming to avoid overtreatment while
monitoring disease progression through serial MRI and clinical follow-up.
Accurate prostate segmentation is an important preliminary step for automating
this process, enabling automated detection and diagnosis of PCa. However,
existing deep-learning segmentation models are often trained on
single-time-point and expertly annotated datasets, making them unsuitable for
longitudinal AS analysis, where multiple time points and a scarcity of expert
labels hinder their effective fine-tuning. To address these challenges, we
propose MambaX-Net, a novel semi-supervised, dual-scan 3D segmentation
architecture that computes the segmentation for time point t by leveraging the
MRI and the corresponding segmentation mask from the previous time point. We
introduce two new components: (i) a Mamba-enhanced Cross-Attention Module,
which integrates the Mamba block into cross attention to efficiently capture
temporal evolution and long-range spatial dependencies, and (ii) a Shape
Extractor Module that encodes the previous segmentation mask into a latent
anatomical representation for refined zone delination. Moreover, we introduce a
semi-supervised self-training strategy that leverages pseudo-labels generated
from a pre-trained nnU-Net, enabling effective learning without expert
annotations. MambaX-Net was evaluated on a longitudinal AS dataset, and results
showed that it significantly outperforms state-of-the-art U-Net and
Transformer-based models, achieving superior prostate zone segmentation even
when trained on limited and noisy data.

Motivation: 减少对昂贵像素级标注的依赖，实现智能基础设施维护中的道路裂缝检测。

Method: 集成三个组件：生成类激活图的分类器、测量特征可推断性的重建器、生成像素级检测结果的检测器；采用交替对抗学习策略；设计了路径感知注意力模块和中心增强CAM一致性模块。

Result: 在三个图像级数据集上的实验表明，WP-CrackNet达到与监督方法相当的结果，并优于现有弱监督方法。

Conclusion: 该方法显著推进了可扩展的道路检测，源代码和数据集已公开。

Abstract: Road crack detection is essential for intelligent infrastructure maintenance
in smart cities. To reduce reliance on costly pixel-level annotations, we
propose WP-CrackNet, an end-to-end weakly-supervised method that trains with
only image-level labels for pixel-wise crack detection. WP-CrackNet integrates
three components: a classifier generating class activation maps (CAMs), a
reconstructor measuring feature inferability, and a detector producing
pixel-wise road crack detection results. During training, the classifier and
reconstructor alternate in adversarial learning to encourage crack CAMs to
cover complete crack regions, while the detector learns from pseudo labels
derived from post-processed crack CAMs. This mutual feedback among the three
components improves learning stability and detection accuracy. To further boost
detection performance, we design a path-aware attention module (PAAM) that
fuses high-level semantics from the classifier with low-level structural cues
from the reconstructor by modeling spatial and channel-wise dependencies.
Additionally, a center-enhanced CAM consistency module (CECCM) is proposed to
refine crack CAMs using center Gaussian weighting and consistency constraints,
enabling better pseudo-label generation. We create three image-level datasets
and extensive experiments show that WP-CrackNet achieves comparable results to
supervised methods and outperforms existing weakly-supervised methods,
significantly advancing scalable road inspection. The source code package and
datasets are available at https://mias.group/WP-CrackNet/.

Motivation: 现有的3D前馈模型（如VGGT）在静态数据集上训练，难以处理包含复杂动态元素（如移动人物或可变形物体）的真实世界场景。

Method: 提出动态感知聚合器，通过预测动态感知掩码来分离静态和动态信息——抑制运动线索用于姿态估计，同时增强它们用于几何重建。

Result: 广泛实验表明，PAGE-4D在动态场景中持续优于原始VGGT，在相机姿态估计、单目和视频深度估计以及密集点图重建方面取得更优结果。

Conclusion: PAGE-4D成功解决了多任务4D重建中的任务冲突问题，通过动态感知聚合器有效处理动态场景的3D属性推断。

Abstract: Recent 3D feed-forward models, such as the Visual Geometry Grounded
Transformer (VGGT), have shown strong capability in inferring 3D attributes of
static scenes. However, since they are typically trained on static datasets,
these models often struggle in real-world scenarios involving complex dynamic
elements, such as moving humans or deformable objects like umbrellas. To
address this limitation, we introduce PAGE-4D, a feedforward model that extends
VGGT to dynamic scenes, enabling camera pose estimation, depth prediction, and
point cloud reconstruction -- all without post-processing. A central challenge
in multi-task 4D reconstruction is the inherent conflict between tasks:
accurate camera pose estimation requires suppressing dynamic regions, while
geometry reconstruction requires modeling them. To resolve this tension, we
propose a dynamics-aware aggregator that disentangles static and dynamic
information by predicting a dynamics-aware mask -- suppressing motion cues for
pose estimation while amplifying them for geometry reconstruction. Extensive
experiments show that PAGE-4D consistently outperforms the original VGGT in
dynamic scenarios, achieving superior results in camera pose estimation,
monocular and video depth estimation, and dense point map reconstruction.

Conclusion: UCIS-SAM通过专门设计的模块有效解决了水下伪装实例分割的挑战，为水下视觉任务提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: With the development of underwater exploration and marine protection,
underwater vision tasks are widespread. Due to the degraded underwater
environment, characterized by color distortion, low contrast, and blurring,
camouflaged instance segmentation (CIS) faces greater challenges in accurately
segmenting objects that blend closely with their surroundings. Traditional
camouflaged instance segmentation methods, trained on terrestrial-dominated
datasets with limited underwater samples, may exhibit inadequate performance in
underwater scenes. To address these issues, we introduce the first underwater
camouflaged instance segmentation (UCIS) dataset, abbreviated as UCIS4K, which
comprises 3,953 images of camouflaged marine organisms with instance-level
annotations. In addition, we propose an Underwater Camouflaged Instance
Segmentation network based on Segment Anything Model (UCIS-SAM). Our UCIS-SAM
includes three key modules. First, the Channel Balance Optimization Module
(CBOM) enhances channel characteristics to improve underwater feature learning,
effectively addressing the model's limited understanding of underwater
environments. Second, the Frequency Domain True Integration Module (FDTIM) is
proposed to emphasize intrinsic object features and reduce interference from
camouflage patterns, enhancing the segmentation performance of camouflaged
objects blending with their surroundings. Finally, the Multi-scale Feature
Frequency Aggregation Module (MFFAM) is designed to strengthen the boundaries
of low-contrast camouflaged instances across multiple frequency bands,
improving the model's ability to achieve more precise segmentation of
camouflaged objects. Extensive experiments on the proposed UCIS4K and public
benchmarks show that our UCIS-SAM outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.

Abstract: 3D generation from natural language offers significant potential to reduce
expert manual modeling efforts and enhance accessibility to 3D assets. However,
existing methods often yield unstructured meshes and exhibit poor
interactivity, making them impractical for artistic workflows. To address these
limitations, we represent 3D assets as shape programs and introduce ShapeCraft,
a novel multi-agent framework for text-to-3D generation. At its core, we
propose a Graph-based Procedural Shape (GPS) representation that decomposes
complex natural language into a structured graph of sub-tasks, thereby
facilitating accurate LLM comprehension and interpretation of spatial
relationships and semantic shape details. Specifically, LLM agents
hierarchically parse user input to initialize GPS, then iteratively refine
procedural modeling and painting to produce structured, textured, and
interactive 3D assets. Qualitative and quantitative experiments demonstrate
ShapeCraft's superior performance in generating geometrically accurate and
semantically rich 3D assets compared to existing LLM-based agents. We further
show the versatility of ShapeCraft through examples of animated and
user-customized editing, highlighting its potential for broader interactive
applications.

Abstract: The advancement of UAV technology has enabled efficient, non-contact
structural health monitoring. Combined with photogrammetry, UAVs can capture
high-resolution scans and reconstruct detailed 3D models of infrastructure.
However, a key challenge remains in segmenting specific structural components
from these models-a process traditionally reliant on time-consuming and
error-prone manual labeling. To address this issue, we propose a machine
learning-based framework for automated segmentation of 3D point clouds. Our
approach uses the complementary strengths of real-world UAV-scanned point
clouds and synthetic data generated from Building Information Modeling (BIM) to
overcome the limitations associated with manual labeling. Validation on a
railroad track dataset demonstrated high accuracy in identifying and segmenting
major components such as rails and crossties. Moreover, by using smaller-scale
datasets supplemented with BIM data, the framework significantly reduced
training time while maintaining reasonable segmentation accuracy. This
automated approach improves the precision and efficiency of 3D infrastructure
model segmentation and advances the integration of UAV and BIM technologies in
structural health monitoring and infrastructure management.

Motivation: 解决现有多类异常检测模型性能不足的问题，并统一专门化方法，消除部署障碍，提供全谱图像异常检测的统一解决方案。

Method: 基于"少即是多"理念，在标准重建框架中协调五个简单元素，无需修改即可自然扩展到多样化任务。

Result: 在12个基准测试中表现优异：多类模型在MVTec-AD和VisA上分别达到99.9%和99.3%的AUROC；仅用每类8个正常样本就超越之前全样本模型；在多视图和多模态检测中达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: Dinomaly2通过极简设计、计算可扩展性和通用适用性，成为现实世界异常检测应用的统一解决方案。

Abstract: Unsupervised anomaly detection (UAD) has evolved from building specialized
single-class models to unified multi-class models, yet existing multi-class
models significantly underperform the most advanced one-for-one counterparts.
Moreover, the field has fragmented into specialized methods tailored to
specific scenarios (multi-class, 3D, few-shot, etc.), creating deployment
barriers and highlighting the need for a unified solution. In this paper, we
present Dinomaly2, the first unified framework for full-spectrum image UAD,
which bridges the performance gap in multi-class models while seamlessly
extending across diverse data modalities and task settings. Guided by the "less
is more" philosophy, we demonstrate that the orchestration of five simple
element achieves superior performance in a standard reconstruction-based
framework. This methodological minimalism enables natural extension across
diverse tasks without modification, establishing that simplicity is the
foundation of true universality. Extensive experiments on 12 UAD benchmarks
demonstrate Dinomaly2's full-spectrum superiority across multiple modalities
(2D, multi-view, RGB-3D, RGB-IR), task settings (single-class, multi-class,
inference-unified multi-class, few-shot) and application domains (industrial,
biological, outdoor). For example, our multi-class model achieves unprecedented
99.9% and 99.3% image-level (I-) AUROC on MVTec-AD and VisA respectively. For
multi-view and multi-modal inspection, Dinomaly2 demonstrates state-of-the-art
performance with minimum adaptations. Moreover, using only 8 normal examples
per class, our method surpasses previous full-shot models, achieving 98.7% and
97.4% I-AUROC on MVTec-AD and VisA. The combination of minimalistic design,
computational scalability, and universal applicability positions Dinomaly2 as a
unified solution for the full spectrum of real-world anomaly detection
applications.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CaMiT是一个细粒度数据集，捕捉汽车模型随时间演变的过程，支持监督和自监督学习。研究发现静态预训练在跨年测试时性能下降，提出时间增量分类设置和两种策略来提升时间鲁棒性，并探索了时间感知图像生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI系统需要适应不断变化的视觉环境，特别是在对象外观随时间变化的领域。汽车模型作为技术产品的代表类别，其随时间演变的过程需要被研究。

Method: 构建CaMiT数据集（787K标注样本和5.1M未标注样本），提出时间增量分类设置，评估两种策略：时间增量预训练（更新主干网络）和时间增量分类器学习（仅更新最后一层），并探索时间感知图像生成。

Result: 静态预训练在域内数据上能达到与大规模通用模型竞争的性能且更高效，但在跨年测试时准确率下降。时间增量策略能改善时间鲁棒性，时间感知图像生成能产生更真实的输出。

Conclusion: CaMiT为研究细粒度视觉识别和生成中的时间适应问题提供了丰富的基准，展示了时间增量学习策略在应对类别出现、演变和消失等现实持续学习场景中的有效性。

Abstract: AI systems must adapt to evolving visual environments, especially in domains
where object appearances change over time. We introduce Car Models in Time
(CaMiT), a fine-grained dataset capturing the temporal evolution of car models,
a representative class of technological artifacts. CaMiT includes 787K labeled
samples of 190 car models (2007-2023) and 5.1M unlabeled samples (2005-2023),
supporting both supervised and self-supervised learning. Static pretraining on
in-domain data achieves competitive performance with large-scale generalist
models while being more resource-efficient, yet accuracy declines when models
are tested across years. To address this, we propose a time-incremental
classification setting, a realistic continual learning scenario with emerging,
evolving, and disappearing classes. We evaluate two strategies:
time-incremental pretraining, which updates the backbone, and time-incremental
classifier learning, which updates only the final layer, both improving
temporal robustness. Finally, we explore time-aware image generation that
leverages temporal metadata during training, yielding more realistic outputs.
CaMiT offers a rich benchmark for studying temporal adaptation in fine-grained
visual recognition and generation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 干石墙具有重要的遗产和环境价值，但许多墙体因植被遮挡和人工测绘成本高而未被识别。需要开发可扩展的自动映射方法。

Method: 使用LiDAR衍生的数字高程模型(DEM)克服植被遮挡，提出基于知识蒸馏的自监督跨视图预训练策略，支持多种视觉骨干网络。

Result: 在Budj Bim UNESCO世界遗产地测试，平均交并比(mIoU)达68.6%，仅用10%标注数据微调后仍保持63.8% mIoU。

Conclusion: 该方法展示了在高分辨率DEM衍生物上使用自监督学习在植被茂密、标注稀缺的遗产环境中自动映射干石墙的潜力。

Abstract: Dry-stone walls hold significant heritage and environmental value. Mapping
these structures is essential for ecosystem preservation and wildfire
management in Australia. Yet, many walls remain unidentified due to their
inaccessibility and the high cost of manual mapping. Deep learning-based
segmentation offers a scalable solution, but two major challenges persist: (1)
visual occlusion of low-lying walls by dense vegetation, and (2) limited
labeled data for supervised training. We propose DINO-CV, a segmentation
framework for automatic mapping of low-lying dry-stone walls using
high-resolution Airborne LiDAR-derived digital elevation models (DEMs). DEMs
overcome visual occlusion by capturing terrain structures hidden beneath
vegetation, enabling analysis of structural rather than spectral cues. DINO-CV
introduces a self-supervised cross-view pre-training strategy based on
knowledge distillation to mitigate data scarcity. It learns invariant visual
and geometric representations across multiple DEM derivatives, supporting
various vision backbones including ResNet, Wide ResNet, and Vision
Transformers. Applied to the UNESCO World Heritage cultural landscape of Budj
Bim, Victoria, the method identifies one of Australia's densest collections of
colonial dry-stone walls beyond Indigenous heritage contexts. DINO-CV achieves
a mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) of 68.6% on test areas and maintains
63.8% mIoU when fine-tuned with only 10% labeled data. These results
demonstrate the potential of self-supervised learning on high-resolution DEM
derivatives for automated dry-stone wall mapping in vegetated and heritage-rich
environments with scarce annotations.

TL;DR: 比较两种节俭联邦学习方法用于暴力检测：零样本和联邦微调视觉语言模型(VLMs)与个性化训练紧凑3D CNN。两种方法准确率均超90%，CNN3D在ROC AUC和log loss上略优且能耗更低，VLMs在上下文推理和多模态推理上更优。提出混合模型：轻量CNN用于常规分类，选择性VLM用于复杂场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究节俭联邦学习方法在暴力检测中的应用，重点关注能源效率和环境指标，为视频监控提供负责任、资源感知的AI基准。

Method: 使用LLaVA-7B和65.8M参数CNN3D作为代表案例，在非独立同分布设置下评估准确率、校准和能耗。比较零样本和联邦微调VLMs与个性化训练CNN3D两种策略。

Result: 两种方法准确率均超过90%。CNN3D在ROC AUC和log loss上略优于LoRA微调的VLMs，且能耗更低。VLMs在上下文推理和多模态推理方面保持优势。量化了训练和推理过程中的能耗和CO2排放。

Conclusion: 支持混合模型：轻量CNN用于常规分类，选择性VLM激活用于复杂或描述性场景。为视频监控中的负责任、资源感知AI提供了可复现基准，可扩展到实时、多模态和生命周期感知系统。

Abstract: We examine frugal federated learning approaches to violence detection by
comparing two complementary strategies: (i) zero-shot and federated fine-tuning
of vision-language models (VLMs), and (ii) personalized training of a compact
3D convolutional neural network (CNN3D). Using LLaVA-7B and a 65.8M parameter
CNN3D as representative cases, we evaluate accuracy, calibration, and energy
usage under realistic non-IID settings. Both approaches exceed 90% accuracy.
CNN3D slightly outperforms Low-Rank Adaptation(LoRA)-tuned VLMs in ROC AUC and
log loss, while using less energy. VLMs remain favorable for contextual
reasoning and multimodal inference. We quantify energy and CO$_2$ emissions
across training and inference, and analyze sustainability trade-offs for
deployment. To our knowledge, this is the first comparative study of LoRA-tuned
vision-language models and personalized CNNs for federated violence detection,
with an emphasis on energy efficiency and environmental metrics. These findings
support a hybrid model: lightweight CNNs for routine classification, with
selective VLM activation for complex or descriptive scenarios. The resulting
framework offers a reproducible baseline for responsible, resource-aware AI in
video surveillance, with extensions toward real-time, multimodal, and
lifecycle-aware systems.

TL;DR: 4DSegStreamer是一个用于4D全景分割的流式处理框架，采用双线程系统实现实时处理，可集成到现有3D/4D分割方法中，在动态环境中表现出优越的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决高度动态环境（如密集人群疏散、复杂自动驾驶场景）中需要实时细粒度感知的问题，在有限时间预算内实现4D全景分割。

Method: 采用双线程系统：预测线程利用历史运动和几何信息提取特征并预测未来动态；推理线程通过对齐最新内存并补偿自运动和动态对象移动来确保对传入帧的及时预测。

Result: 在室内HOI4D数据集和室外SemanticKITTI、nuScenes数据集上的综合实验证明了方法的有效性，特别是在复杂场景中准确预测动态对象方面表现优异。

Conclusion: 4DSegStreamer是一个通用且高效的流式处理框架，能够为现有3D/4D分割方法提供实时能力，在高FPS条件下展现出比现有流式感知方法更强的鲁棒性。

Abstract: 4D panoptic segmentation in a streaming setting is critical for highly
dynamic environments, such as evacuating dense crowds and autonomous driving in
complex scenarios, where real-time, fine-grained perception within a
constrained time budget is essential. In this paper, we introduce
4DSegStreamer, a novel framework that employs a Dual-Thread System to
efficiently process streaming frames. The framework is general and can be
seamlessly integrated into existing 3D and 4D segmentation methods to enable
real-time capability. It also demonstrates superior robustness compared to
existing streaming perception approaches, particularly under high FPS
conditions. The system consists of a predictive thread and an inference thread.
The predictive thread leverages historical motion and geometric information to
extract features and forecast future dynamics. The inference thread ensures
timely prediction for incoming frames by aligning with the latest memory and
compensating for ego-motion and dynamic object movements. We evaluate
4DSegStreamer on the indoor HOI4D dataset and the outdoor SemanticKITTI and
nuScenes datasets. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of
our approach, particularly in accurately predicting dynamic objects in complex
scenes.

Motivation: 现有图像编辑模型主要关注指令完成度，但忽视了物理效果的真实性，如移除物体时未处理其阴影、反射等物理交互。

Method: 构建PICABench基准测试，涵盖多种编辑操作；提出PICAEval评估协议，使用VLM作为评判者；创建PICA-100K训练数据集从视频中学习物理知识。

Result: 评估主流模型后发现物理真实性仍是具有挑战性的问题，存在很大改进空间。

Conclusion: 该基准测试和解决方案为从简单内容编辑向物理一致的真实性转变提供了基础，推动未来研究发展。

Abstract: Image editing has achieved remarkable progress recently. Modern editing
models could already follow complex instructions to manipulate the original
content. However, beyond completing the editing instructions, the accompanying
physical effects are the key to the generation realism. For example, removing
an object should also remove its shadow, reflections, and interactions with
nearby objects. Unfortunately, existing models and benchmarks mainly focus on
instruction completion but overlook these physical effects. So, at this moment,
how far are we from physically realistic image editing? To answer this, we
introduce PICABench, which systematically evaluates physical realism across
eight sub-dimension (spanning optics, mechanics, and state transitions) for
most of the common editing operations (add, remove, attribute change, etc). We
further propose the PICAEval, a reliable evaluation protocol that uses
VLM-as-a-judge with per-case, region-level human annotations and questions.
Beyond benchmarking, we also explore effective solutions by learning physics
from videos and construct a training dataset PICA-100K. After evaluating most
of the mainstream models, we observe that physical realism remains a
challenging problem with large rooms to explore. We hope that our benchmark and
proposed solutions can serve as a foundation for future work moving from naive
content editing toward physically consistent realism.

Result: 在三个公开医学图像分割数据集上的实验表明，IC-MoE优于其他SOTA模型，具有良好的泛化能力。

Conclusion: IC-MoE有效补充了基础医学图像分割模型的高层特征表示能力，同时保持了预训练权重的结构完整性。

Abstract: Foundation models for medical image segmentation have achieved remarkable
performance. Adaptive fine-tuning of natural image segmentation foundation
models is crucial for medical image segmentation tasks. However, some
limitations exist in existing fine-tuning methods: 1) insufficient
representation of high-level features and 2) the fine-tuning process disrupts
the structural integrity of pretrained weights. Inspired by these critical
problems, we propose an intelligent communication mixture-of-experts
boosted-medical image segmentation foundation model, named IC-MoE, with twofold
ideas: 1) We construct basic experts, semantic experts, and adaptive experts.
Moreover, we implement a pixel probability adaptive voting strategy, which
enables expert selection and fusion through label consistency and load
balancing. This approach preliminarily enhances the representation capability
of high-level features while preserving the structural integrity of pretrained
weights. 2) We propose a semantic-guided contrastive learning method to address
the issue of weak supervision in contrastive learning. This method further
enhances the representation capability of high-level features while preserving
the structural integrity of pretrained weights. Extensive experiments across
three public medical image segmentation datasets demonstrate that the IC-MoE
outperforms other SOTA models. Consequently, the proposed IC-MoE effectively
supplements foundational medical image segmentation models with high-level
features and pretrained structural integrity. We also validate the superior
generalizability of the IC-MoE across diverse medical image segmentation
scenarios.

Motivation: 解决文本到图像人物检索中的模态异质性问题，现有方法要么忽略细粒度差异，要么需要先验信息进行局部对齐，且当前方法主要针对英语，限制了在多语言环境中的应用。

Method: 提出Bi-IRRA框架，包含双向隐式关系推理模块（通过掩码图像和文本的双向预测增强跨语言和跨模态的局部关系建模）和多维全局对齐模块（桥接模态异质性）。

Result: 在所有多语言TIPR数据集上取得了新的最先进结果。

Conclusion: Bi-IRRA框架有效解决了多语言文本到图像人物检索中的模态异质性问题，通过隐式关系推理和全局对齐实现了跨语言和跨模态的准确匹配。

Abstract: Text-to-image person retrieval (TIPR) aims to identify the target person
using textual descriptions, facing challenge in modality heterogeneity. Prior
works have attempted to address it by developing cross-modal global or local
alignment strategies. However, global methods typically overlook fine-grained
cross-modal differences, whereas local methods require prior information to
explore explicit part alignments. Additionally, current methods are
English-centric, restricting their application in multilingual contexts. To
alleviate these issues, we pioneer a multilingual TIPR task by developing a
multilingual TIPR benchmark, for which we leverage large language models for
initial translations and refine them by integrating domain-specific knowledge.
Correspondingly, we propose Bi-IRRA: a Bidirectional Implicit Relation
Reasoning and Aligning framework to learn alignment across languages and
modalities. Within Bi-IRRA, a bidirectional implicit relation reasoning module
enables bidirectional prediction of masked image and text, implicitly enhancing
the modeling of local relations across languages and modalities, a
multi-dimensional global alignment module is integrated to bridge the modality
heterogeneity. The proposed method achieves new state-of-the-art results on all
multilingual TIPR datasets. Data and code are presented in
https://github.com/Flame-Chasers/Bi-IRRA.

Abstract: Recent advancements in 3D object detection and novel category detection have
made significant progress, yet research on learning generalized 3D objectness
remains insufficient. In this paper, we delve into learning open-world 3D
objectness, which focuses on detecting all objects in a 3D scene, including
novel objects unseen during training. Traditional closed-set 3D detectors
struggle to generalize to open-world scenarios, while directly incorporating 3D
open-vocabulary models for open-world ability struggles with vocabulary
expansion and semantic overlap. To achieve generalized 3D object discovery, We
propose OP3Det, a class-agnostic Open-World Prompt-free 3D Detector to detect
any objects within 3D scenes without relying on hand-crafted text prompts. We
introduce the strong generalization and zero-shot capabilities of 2D foundation
models, utilizing both 2D semantic priors and 3D geometric priors for
class-agnostic proposals to broaden 3D object discovery. Then, by integrating
complementary information from point cloud and RGB image in the cross-modal
mixture of experts, OP3Det dynamically routes uni-modal and multi-modal
features to learn generalized 3D objectness. Extensive experiments demonstrate
the extraordinary performance of OP3Det, which significantly surpasses existing
open-world 3D detectors by up to 16.0% in AR and achieves a 13.5% improvement
compared to closed-world 3D detectors.

Conclusion: GAS方法通过简单参数化和对抗训练的结合，有效解决了扩散模型采样效率问题，同时提升了生成质量。

Abstract: While diffusion models achieve state-of-the-art generation quality, they
still suffer from computationally expensive sampling. Recent works address this
issue with gradient-based optimization methods that distill a few-step ODE
diffusion solver from the full sampling process, reducing the number of
function evaluations from dozens to just a few. However, these approaches often
rely on intricate training techniques and do not explicitly focus on preserving
fine-grained details. In this paper, we introduce the Generalized Solver: a
simple parameterization of the ODE sampler that does not require additional
training tricks and improves quality over existing approaches. We further
combine the original distillation loss with adversarial training, which
mitigates artifacts and enhances detail fidelity. We call the resulting method
the Generalized Adversarial Solver and demonstrate its superior performance
compared to existing solver training methods under similar resource
constraints. Code is available at https://github.com/3145tttt/GAS.

Abstract: Vision foundation models achieve remarkable performance but are only
available in a limited set of pre-determined sizes, forcing sub-optimal
deployment choices under real-world constraints. We introduce SnapViT:
Single-shot network approximation for pruned Vision Transformers, a new
post-pretraining structured pruning method that enables elastic inference
across a continuum of compute budgets. Our approach efficiently combines
gradient information with cross-network structure correlations, approximated
via an evolutionary algorithm, does not require labeled data, generalizes to
models without a classification head, and is retraining-free. Experiments on
DINO, SigLIPv2, DeIT, and AugReg models demonstrate superior performance over
state-of-the-art methods across various sparsities, requiring less than five
minutes on a single A100 GPU to generate elastic models that can be adjusted to
any computational budget. Our key contributions include an efficient pruning
strategy for pretrained Vision Transformers, a novel evolutionary approximation
of Hessian off-diagonal structures, and a self-supervised importance scoring
mechanism that maintains strong performance without requiring retraining or

Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disease affecting about 1% of
people over the age of 60, causing motor impairments that impede hand
coordination activities such as writing and drawing. Many approaches have tried
to support early detection of Parkinson's disease based on hand-drawn images;
however, we identified two major limitations in the related works: (1) the lack
of sufficient datasets, (2) the robustness when dealing with unseen patient
data. In this paper, we propose a new approach to detect Parkinson's disease
that consists of two stages: The first stage classifies based on their drawing
type(circle, meander, spiral), and the second stage extracts the required
features from the images and detects Parkinson's disease. We overcame the
previous two limitations by applying a chunking strategy where we divide each
image into 2x2 chunks. Each chunk is processed separately when extracting
features and recognizing Parkinson's disease indicators. To make the final
classification, an ensemble method is used to merge the decisions made from
each chunk. Our evaluation shows that our proposed approach outperforms the top
performing state-of-the-art approaches, in particular on unseen patients. On
the NewHandPD dataset our approach, it achieved 97.08% accuracy for seen
patients and 94.91% for unseen patients, our proposed approach maintained a gap
of only 2.17 percentage points, compared to the 4.76-point drop observed in
prior work.

Abstract: Circulating blood cell clusters (CCCs) containing red blood cells (RBCs),
white blood cells(WBCs), and platelets are significant biomarkers linked to
conditions like thrombosis, infection, and inflammation. Flow cytometry, paired
with fluorescence staining, is commonly used to analyze these cell clusters,
revealing cell morphology and protein profiles. While computational approaches
based on machine learning have advanced the automatic analysis of single-cell
flow cytometry images, there is a lack of effort to build tools to
automatically analyze images containing CCCs. Unlike single cells, cell
clusters often exhibit irregular shapes and sizes. In addition, these cell
clusters often consist of heterogeneous cell types, which require multi-channel
staining to identify the specific cell types within the clusters. This study
introduces a new computational framework for analyzing CCC images and
identifying cell types within clusters. Our framework uses a two-step analysis
strategy. First, it categorizes images into cell cluster and non-cluster groups
by fine-tuning the You Only Look Once(YOLOv11) model, which outperforms
traditional convolutional neural networks (CNNs), Vision Transformers (ViT).
Then, it identifies cell types by overlaying cluster contours with regions from
multi-channel fluorescence stains, enhancing accuracy despite cell debris and
staining artifacts. This approach achieved over 95% accuracy in both cluster
classification and phenotype identification. In summary, our automated
framework effectively analyzes CCC images from flow cytometry, leveraging both
bright-field and fluorescence data. Initially tested on blood cells, it holds
potential for broader applications, such as analyzing immune and tumor cell
clusters, supporting cellular research across various diseases.

*Zhiqiang Teng,Beibei Lin,Tingting Chen,Zifeng Yuan,Xuanyi Li,Xuanyu Zhang,Shunli Zhang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: RaindropGS是一个用于评估3D高斯泼溅在雨滴干扰条件下完整流程的基准测试，包括从无约束雨滴污染图像到清晰3D重建的整个过程，揭示了现有方法在真实雨滴条件下的性能限制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基准测试通常使用已知相机姿态的合成雨滴图像评估3DGS，但在真实场景中，雨滴会干扰相机姿态估计和点云初始化，且合成与真实雨滴存在显著域差距，影响泛化能力。

Method: 构建包含三个对齐图像集（雨滴聚焦、背景聚焦和无雨地面实况）的真实世界雨滴重建数据集，设计完整基准流程：数据准备、数据处理和雨滴感知3DGS评估。

Result: 通过综合实验揭示了现有3DGS方法在无约束雨滴图像上的性能限制，以及不同流程组件（相机焦点位置、不准确姿态和点云初始化）对重建的干扰影响。

Conclusion: 这些发现为开发在雨滴条件下更鲁棒的3DGS方法指明了明确方向。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) under raindrop conditions suffers from severe
occlusions and optical distortions caused by raindrop contamination on the
camera lens, substantially degrading reconstruction quality. Existing
benchmarks typically evaluate 3DGS using synthetic raindrop images with known
camera poses (constrained images), assuming ideal conditions. However, in
real-world scenarios, raindrops often interfere with accurate camera pose
estimation and point cloud initialization. Moreover, a significant domain gap
between synthetic and real raindrops further impairs generalization. To tackle
these issues, we introduce RaindropGS, a comprehensive benchmark designed to
evaluate the full 3DGS pipeline-from unconstrained, raindrop-corrupted images
to clear 3DGS reconstructions. Specifically, the whole benchmark pipeline
consists of three parts: data preparation, data processing, and raindrop-aware
3DGS evaluation, including types of raindrop interference, camera pose
estimation and point cloud initialization, single image rain removal
comparison, and 3D Gaussian training comparison. First, we collect a real-world
raindrop reconstruction dataset, in which each scene contains three aligned
image sets: raindrop-focused, background-focused, and rain-free ground truth,
enabling a comprehensive evaluation of reconstruction quality under different
focus conditions. Through comprehensive experiments and analyses, we reveal
critical insights into the performance limitations of existing 3DGS methods on
unconstrained raindrop images and the varying impact of different pipeline
components: the impact of camera focus position on 3DGS reconstruction
performance, and the interference caused by inaccurate pose and point cloud
initialization on reconstruction. These insights establish clear directions for
developing more robust 3DGS methods under raindrop conditions.

Abstract: The recent development of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has
significantly advanced AI's ability to understand visual modalities. However,
existing evaluation benchmarks remain limited to single-turn question
answering, overlooking the complexity of multi-turn dialogues in real-world
scenarios. To bridge this gap, we introduce MT-Video-Bench, a holistic video
understanding benchmark for evaluating MLLMs in multi-turn dialogues.
Specifically, our MT-Video-Bench mainly assesses six core competencies that
focus on perceptivity and interactivity, encompassing 987 meticulously curated
multi-turn dialogues from diverse domains. These capabilities are rigorously
aligned with real-world applications, such as interactive sports analysis and
multi-turn video-based intelligent tutoring. With MT-Video-Bench, we
extensively evaluate various state-of-the-art open-source and closed-source
MLLMs, revealing their significant performance discrepancies and limitations in
handling multi-turn video dialogues. The benchmark will be publicly available
to foster future research.

TL;DR: 该研究探索了离线签名验证中的特征学习策略，重点关注提高跨数据集泛化能力。使用三个公开基准数据集，开发了基于原始签名图像和壳预处理两种实验流程，发现原始图像模型表现更好，但壳预处理方法具有改进潜力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决离线签名验证中由于笔迹风格和采集协议差异导致的跨数据集泛化问题，提高模型在不同数据集间的鲁棒性。

Method: 使用CEDAR、ICDAR和GPDS Synthetic三个公开基准数据集，开发了两种实验流程：基于原始签名图像的方法和采用壳预处理的方法。

Result: 原始图像模型在跨基准测试中获得了更高的性能，而基于壳预处理的方法显示出未来改进的潜力，但两种方法之间没有明确的优劣之分。

Conclusion: 虽然原始图像方法当前表现更好，但壳预处理方法为开发鲁棒的跨域签名验证系统提供了有前景的方向，值得进一步研究改进。

Abstract: Automated signature verification is a critical biometric technique used in
banking, identity authentication, and legal documentation. Despite the notable
progress achieved by deep learning methods, most approaches in offline
signature verification still struggle to generalize across datasets, as
variations in handwriting styles and acquisition protocols often degrade
performance. This study investigates feature learning strategies for signature
forgery detection, focusing on improving cross-dataset generalization -- that
is, model robustness when trained on one dataset and tested on another. Using
three public benchmarks -- CEDAR, ICDAR, and GPDS Synthetic -- two experimental
pipelines were developed: one based on raw signature images and another
employing a preprocessing method referred to as shell preprocessing. Several
behavioral patterns were identified and analyzed; however, no definitive
superiority between the two approaches was established. The results show that
the raw-image model achieved higher performance across benchmarks, while the
shell-based model demonstrated promising potential for future refinement toward
robust, cross-domain signature verification.

Motivation: 解决多参考视觉位置识别中，面对不同条件下的参考集时，现有方法要么需要大量训练计算成本高，要么基于启发式方法在视角和外观变化下性能提升有限的问题。

Method: 使用矩阵分解将多个参考描述符联合建模为基表示，然后通过投影进行残差匹配，该方法无需训练且与具体描述符无关。

Result: 在多外观数据上，Recall@1比单参考方法提升约18%，在视角和外观变化下均优于多参考基线方法，在非结构化数据上也有约5%的提升。

Conclusion: 该方法在保持轻量级的同时展现了强大的泛化能力，为多参考视觉位置识别提供了一种有效的训练免费解决方案。

Abstract: We address multi-reference visual place recognition (VPR), where reference
sets captured under varying conditions are used to improve localisation
performance. While deep learning with large-scale training improves robustness,
increasing data diversity and model complexity incur extensive computational
cost during training and deployment. Descriptor-level fusion via voting or
aggregation avoids training, but often targets multi-sensor setups or relies on
heuristics with limited gains under appearance and viewpoint change. We propose
a training-free, descriptor-agnostic approach that jointly models places using
multiple reference descriptors via matrix decomposition into basis
representations, enabling projection-based residual matching. We also introduce
SotonMV, a structured benchmark for multi-viewpoint VPR. On multi-appearance
data, our method improves Recall@1 by up to ~18% over single-reference and
outperforms multi-reference baselines across appearance and viewpoint changes,
with gains of ~5% on unstructured data, demonstrating strong generalisation
while remaining lightweight.

TL;DR: 提出基于双编码器注意力框架的皮肤癌分类方法，结合病灶分割和临床元数据，提高分类准确性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 皮肤癌早期检测至关重要，但现有深度学习模型存在"黑箱"问题，缺乏临床信任。病灶内高类内变异性和类间细微差异也增加了自动诊断的难度。

Method: 使用带双注意力门和空洞空间金字塔池化的Deep-UNet进行病灶分割，然后采用双DenseNet201编码器分别处理原图和分割病灶，通过多头交叉注意力融合特征，并加入基于transformer的模块整合患者元数据。

Result: 在HAM10000数据集和ISIC 2018、2019挑战中达到最先进的分割性能，显著提高了分类准确率和平均AUC。Grad-CAM热图验证模型基于病灶区域进行预测。

Conclusion: 通过整合精确的病灶分割、临床数据和注意力融合，实现了更准确和可解释的皮肤癌分类模型。

Abstract: Skin cancer is a life-threatening disease where early detection significantly
improves patient outcomes. Automated diagnosis from dermoscopic images is
challenging due to high intra-class variability and subtle inter-class
differences. Many deep learning models operate as "black boxes," limiting
clinical trust. In this work, we propose a dual-encoder attention-based
framework that leverages both segmented lesions and clinical metadata to
enhance skin lesion classification in terms of both accuracy and
interpretability. A novel Deep-UNet architecture with Dual Attention Gates
(DAG) and Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling (ASPP) is first employed to segment
lesions. The classification stage uses two DenseNet201 encoders-one on the
original image and another on the segmented lesion whose features are fused via
multi-head cross-attention. This dual-input design guides the model to focus on
salient pathological regions. In addition, a transformer-based module
incorporates patient metadata (age, sex, lesion site) into the prediction. We
evaluate our approach on the HAM10000 dataset and the ISIC 2018 and 2019
challenges. The proposed method achieves state-of-the-art segmentation
performance and significantly improves classification accuracy and average AUC
compared to baseline models. To validate our model's reliability, we use
Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) to generate heatmaps.
These visualizations confirm that our model's predictions are based on the
lesion area, unlike models that rely on spurious background features. These
results demonstrate that integrating precise lesion segmentation and clinical
data with attention-based fusion leads to a more accurate and interpretable
skin cancer classification model.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SparseVILA是一种高效的视觉语言模型推理范式，通过在预填充阶段剪枝冗余视觉token，在解码阶段仅检索查询相关token，实现视觉稀疏性的解耦，显著提升推理速度而不损失能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型的扩展性受到视觉token数量增长的限制，这些token主导了推理延迟。现有方法难以同时优化预填充和解码阶段的效率。

Method: 提出解耦视觉稀疏性的方法：预填充阶段进行查询无关的剪枝，解码阶段进行查询感知的token检索。基于AWQ优化的推理管道实现。

Result: 在长上下文视频任务中实现4.0倍预填充加速、2.5倍解码加速和2.6倍端到端加速，同时在文档理解和推理任务上提高准确性。

Conclusion: SparseVILA通过解耦查询无关剪枝和查询感知检索，为高效多模态推理开辟了新方向，提供无需训练、架构无关的加速框架。

Abstract: Vision Language Models (VLMs) have rapidly advanced in integrating visual and
textual reasoning, powering applications across high-resolution image
understanding, long-video analysis, and multi-turn conversation. However, their
scalability remains limited by the growing number of visual tokens that
dominate inference latency. We present SparseVILA, a new paradigm for efficient
VLM inference that decouples visual sparsity across the prefilling and decoding
stages. SparseVILA distributes sparsity across stages by pruning redundant
visual tokens during prefill and retrieving only query-relevant tokens during
decoding. This decoupled design matches leading prefill pruning methods while
preserving multi-turn fidelity by retaining most of the visual cache so that
query-aware tokens can be retrieved at each conversation round. Built on an
AWQ-optimized inference pipeline, SparseVILA achieves up to 4.0 times faster
prefilling, 2.5 times faster decoding, and an overall 2.6 times end-to-end
speedup on long-context video tasks -- while improving accuracy on
document-understanding and reasoning tasks. By decoupling query-agnostic
pruning and query-aware retrieval, SparseVILA establishes a new direction for
efficient multimodal inference, offering a training-free, architecture-agnostic
framework for accelerating large VLMs without sacrificing capability.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UltraCUA是一个基础模型，通过混合动作将GUI原语与高级程序化工具调用无缝集成，解决了计算机使用代理仅依赖原始动作导致的性能瓶颈问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的计算机使用代理仅依赖点击、输入、滚动等原始动作，需要精确的视觉定位和冗长的执行链，导致级联失败和性能瓶颈，而其他代理可以利用丰富的程序化接口。

Method: 包含四个关键组件：自动管道从软件文档、开源仓库和代码生成中扩展程序化工具；合成数据引擎产生超过17,000个可验证任务；大规模高质量混合动作轨迹收集；两阶段训练管道结合监督微调和在线强化学习。

Result: 在OSWorld上，UltraCUA模型相比基础模型实现了22%的相对改进，步骤速度提升11%；在WindowsAgentArena的域外评估中达到21.7%的成功率，优于在Windows数据上训练的基线模型。

Conclusion: 混合动作机制至关重要，减少了错误传播同时保持了执行效率，证明了将GUI原语与程序化工具调用集成的有效性。

Abstract: Multimodal agents for computer use rely exclusively on primitive actions
(click, type, scroll) that require accurate visual grounding and lengthy
execution chains, leading to cascading failures and performance bottlenecks.
While other agents leverage rich programmatic interfaces (APIs, MCP servers,
tools), computer-use agents (CUAs) remain isolated from these capabilities. We
present UltraCUA, a foundation model that bridges this gap through hybrid
action -- seamlessly integrating GUI primitives with high-level programmatic
tool calls. To achieve this, our approach comprises four key components: (1) an
automated pipeline that scales programmatic tools from software documentation,
open-source repositories, and code generation; (2) a synthetic data engine
producing over 17,000 verifiable tasks spanning real-world computer-use
scenarios; (3) a large-scale high-quality hybrid action trajectory collection
with both low-level GUI actions and high-level programmatic tool calls; and (4)
a two-stage training pipeline combining supervised fine-tuning with online
reinforcement learning, enabling strategic alternation between low-level and
high-level actions. Experiments with our 7B and 32B models demonstrate
substantial improvements over state-of-the-art agents. On OSWorld, UltraCUA
models achieve an average 22% relative improvement over base models, while
being 11% faster in terms of steps. Out-of-domain evaluation on
WindowsAgentArena shows our model reaches 21.7% success rate, outperforming
baselines trained on Windows data. The hybrid action mechanism proves critical,
reducing error propagation while maintaining execution efficiency.

TL;DR: Glyph框架通过将长文本渲染为图像，利用视觉语言模型处理，实现3-4倍的token压缩，同时保持与主流LLM相当的准确率，显著提升推理和训练速度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LLM扩展到百万token级别上下文时面临计算和内存成本过高的问题，限制了长上下文LLM的实际应用。

Method: 提出Glyph框架，将长文本渲染成图像，使用视觉语言模型处理；设计基于LLM的遗传搜索来优化视觉渲染配置，平衡准确性和压缩率。

Result: 在多个长上下文基准测试中实现3-4倍token压缩，准确率与Qwen3-8B相当；预填充和解码速度提升约4倍，SFT训练速度提升约2倍；128K上下文VLM可处理1M token级别的文本任务。

Conclusion: 视觉上下文扩展方法有效解决了长上下文建模的计算瓶颈，为长文本处理提供了高效解决方案，同时增强多模态任务能力。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly rely on long-context modeling for
tasks such as document understanding, code analysis, and multi-step reasoning.
However, scaling context windows to the million-token level brings prohibitive
computational and memory costs, limiting the practicality of long-context LLMs.
In this work, we take a different perspective-visual context scaling-to tackle
this challenge. Instead of extending token-based sequences, we propose Glyph, a
framework that renders long texts into images and processes them with
vision-language models (VLMs). This approach substantially compresses textual
input while preserving semantic information, and we further design an
LLM-driven genetic search to identify optimal visual rendering configurations
for balancing accuracy and compression. Through extensive experiments, we
demonstrate that our method achieves 3-4x token compression while maintaining
accuracy comparable to leading LLMs such as Qwen3-8B on various long-context
benchmarks. This compression also leads to around 4x faster prefilling and
decoding, and approximately 2x faster SFT training. Furthermore, under extreme
compression, a 128K-context VLM could scale to handle 1M-token-level text
tasks. In addition, the rendered text data benefits real-world multimodal
tasks, such as document understanding. Our code and model are released at
https://github.com/thu-coai/Glyph.

TL;DR: 提出ConsistEdit方法，针对MM-DiT架构设计的新型注意力控制技术，解决了现有训练自由编辑方法在编辑强度与一致性保持之间的平衡问题，支持多轮和视频编辑。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有训练自由注意力控制方法难以同时实现强编辑能力和与源内容的一致性保持，特别是在多轮和视频编辑中视觉错误会累积。MM-DiT架构的出现为解决这些问题提供了新机会。

Method: 基于对MM-DiT注意力机制的深入分析，提出ConsistEdit方法，包含仅视觉注意力控制、掩码引导预注意力融合、以及查询/键/值令牌的差异化操作。

Result: 在广泛的图像和视频编辑任务中达到最先进性能，支持结构一致和不一致场景，首次实现所有推理步骤和注意力层的无手工编辑，显著提升可靠性和一致性。

Conclusion: ConsistEdit是首个针对MM-DiT架构的专门注意力控制方法，能够实现稳健的多轮和多区域编辑，支持结构一致性的渐进调整，提供更精细的控制能力。

Abstract: Recent advances in training-free attention control methods have enabled
flexible and efficient text-guided editing capabilities for existing generation
models. However, current approaches struggle to simultaneously deliver strong
editing strength while preserving consistency with the source. This limitation
becomes particularly critical in multi-round and video editing, where visual
errors can accumulate over time. Moreover, most existing methods enforce global
consistency, which limits their ability to modify individual attributes such as
texture while preserving others, thereby hindering fine-grained editing.
Recently, the architectural shift from U-Net to MM-DiT has brought significant
improvements in generative performance and introduced a novel mechanism for
integrating text and vision modalities. These advancements pave the way for
overcoming challenges that previous methods failed to resolve. Through an
in-depth analysis of MM-DiT, we identify three key insights into its attention
mechanisms. Building on these, we propose ConsistEdit, a novel attention
control method specifically tailored for MM-DiT. ConsistEdit incorporates
vision-only attention control, mask-guided pre-attention fusion, and
differentiated manipulation of the query, key, and value tokens to produce
consistent, prompt-aligned edits. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
ConsistEdit achieves state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of image
and video editing tasks, including both structure-consistent and
structure-inconsistent scenarios. Unlike prior methods, it is the first
approach to perform editing across all inference steps and attention layers
without handcraft, significantly enhancing reliability and consistency, which
enables robust multi-round and multi-region editing. Furthermore, it supports
progressive adjustment of structural consistency, enabling finer control.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统建筑工作室教学存在学生自主管理、同伴反馈冲突、技术知识与创造力平衡等挑战，而现有AI应用主要关注形式生成和效率，忽视了其作为教学工具的潜力。

Method: 通过识别建筑教育中的教学挑战，提出基于LLM的干预措施，并将这些干预与布鲁姆分类法的可衡量学习成果对齐。

Result: 研究发现LLM能够作为补充工具，提供个性化反馈、组织协作互动、提供适应性认知支架，并能在布鲁姆分类法的各个认知层次上支持学习。

Conclusion: LLM在建筑教育中具有重要教学价值，能够有效应对传统教学挑战，促进学生在知识理解、应用分析和综合评估等多层次能力的发展。

Abstract: The study explores the role of large language models (LLMs) in the context of
the architectural design studio, understood as the pedagogical core of
architectural education. Traditionally, the studio has functioned as an
experiential learning space where students tackle design problems through
reflective practice, peer critique, and faculty guidance. However, the
integration of artificial intelligence (AI) in this environment has been
largely focused on form generation, automation, and representation-al
efficiency, neglecting its potential as a pedagogical tool to strengthen
student autonomy, collaboration, and self-reflection. The objectives of this
research were: (1) to identify pedagogical challenges in self-directed,
peer-to-peer, and teacher-guided learning processes in architecture studies;
(2) to propose AI interventions, particularly through LLM, that contribute to
overcoming these challenges; and (3) to align these interventions with
measurable learning outcomes using Bloom's taxonomy. The findings show that the
main challenges include managing student autonomy, tensions in peer feedback,
and the difficulty of balancing the transmission of technical knowledge with
the stimulation of creativity in teaching. In response to this, LLMs are
emerging as complementary agents capable of generating personalized feedback,
organizing collaborative interactions, and offering adaptive cognitive
scaffolding. Furthermore, their implementation can be linked to the cognitive
levels of Bloom's taxonomy: facilitating the recall and understanding of
architectural concepts, supporting application and analysis through interactive
case studies, and encouraging synthesis and evaluation through hypothetical
design scenarios.

Method: 通过两个实际部署案例验证框架效用：(A)住院时间预测服务，(B)AI增强的放射学二次阅片系统，两者均在受监控、可审计的管道中执行。

Result: 住院时间预测服务R²=0.41-0.58，采用率78%，复杂病例平均住院时间相对下降5-10%；放射学AI系统灵敏度95%，亚厘米可操作发现检测提升8.0个百分点，工作流程未受影响。

Conclusion: 通过结合强大的MLOps、AI安全与治理、教育和以人为本的变革，可以加速AI采用，同时提高安全性和结果质量。

Abstract: We offer a pragmatic model to operationalize responsible, secure, and
sustainable healthcare AI, aligning world-class technical excellence with
organizational readiness. The framework includes five key pillars - Leadership
& Strategy, MLOps & Technical Infrastructure, Governance & Ethics, Education &
Workforce Development, and Change Management & Adoption - and is intended to
operationalize 'compliance-by-design' while delivering measurable impact. We
demonstrate its utility through two deployments. (A) An inpatient length of
stay (LOS) prediction service had R^2=0.41-0.58 with validation cohorts in an
observational pilot (n = 3,184 encounters, 4 units, June-August 2025). Adoption
was 78 percent by week 6, and target units saw 5-10 percent relative declines
in mean LOS for complex cases vs. pre-pilot baselines. (B) An AI-augmented
radiology second-reader for lung nodules (PACS-integrated with thresholding and
explanation overlays) achieved high sensitivity (95 percent) and provided a
+8.0 percentage-point lift in detection of sub-centimeter actionable findings,
without slowing workflow (median report TAT 23 min, p = 0.64). Both services
executed in monitored, auditable pipelines with well-defined rollback, bias
checks, and no evidence of security incidents. These findings indicate that by
combining strong MLOps and AI security with governance, education, and
human-centric change, we can accelerate adoption of AI while improving security
and outcomes. We end with limitations, generalization considerations, and a
roadmap for scaling across varied clinical and operational use cases.

rely mainly on data from adopters (e.g., logs, preference data), focusing on
the needs and tasks for a limited demographic group of adopters in terms of
geographic location, education, and gender. In this position paper, we argue
that incorporating non-adopter perspectives is essential for developing broadly
useful and capable LLMs. We contend that relying on methods that focus
primarily on adopters will risk missing a range of tasks and needs prioritized
by non-adopters, entrenching inequalities in who benefits from LLMs, and
creating oversights in model development and evaluation. To illustrate this
claim, we conduct case studies with non-adopters and show: how non-adopter
needs diverge from those of current users, how non-adopter needs point us
towards novel reasoning tasks, and how to systematically integrate non-adopter
needs via human-centered methods.

### [185] [Impact of AI Tools on Learning Outcomes: Decreasing Knowledge and Over-Reliance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16019)
*Márton Benedek,Balázs R. Sziklai*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 研究调查生成式AI工具对学生学习成果的影响，发现AI使用导致学生参与度降低、理解力下降，且学生对AI产生严重依赖


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 了解学生依赖生成式AI工具完成作业和考试对其学习动机、知识理解以及知识获取过程的替代影响

Method: 在布达佩斯考文纽斯大学运营研究课程中进行随机分组实验，一组允许使用AI工具，另一组不允许，并引入补偿机制确保公平性

Result: AI工具的无控制使用导致学生参与度降低、对材料的理解力下降；学生的极端反应表明AI工具已成为学生不可或缺的学习工具

Conclusion: 生成式AI工具已深度融入学生学习过程，对其学习过程的有效性提出根本性质疑，需要重新思考教育评估方法

Abstract: Students at all levels of education are increasingly relying on generative
artificial intelligence (AI) tools to complete assignments and achieve higher
exam scores. However, it remains unclear how this reliance affects their
motivation, their genuine understanding of the material, and the extent to
which it substitutes for the process of knowledge acquisition. To investigate
the impact of generative AI on learning outcomes, an experiment was conducted
at Corvinus University of Budapest. In an operations research class, students
were randomly assigned into two groups: one was permitted to use AI tools
during classes and examinations, while the other was not. To ensure fairness, a
compensation mechanism was introduced: students in the lower-performing group
received point adjustments until the average performance of the two groups was
equalized. Despite the organizers' best efforts to explain the design and to
create equal opportunities for all participants, many students perceived the
experiment as a major disruption. Although the experiment was approved by every
relevant university authority -- including the Ethics Board, the Head of
Department, the Program Director, and the Student Council -- students escalated
their concerns to the media and eventually to the State Secretary for Higher
Education of Hungary. As a result, the experiment had to be substantially
revised before completion: on the final exam the test group was merged with the
control group. Still, the data allowed us to draw decisive conclusions
regarding the students' learning habits. Uncontrolled use of AI tools leads to
disengaged students and low understanding of material. The extreme reactions of
the students proved even more revealing than the data collected: generative AI
tools have already become indispensable for students, raising fundamental
questions about the validity of their learning process.

### [186] [A dual typology of social media interventions and deterrence mechanisms against misinformation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16032)
*Amir Karami*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个双元分类法，将社交媒体平台的五种干预措施（移除、减少、告知、复合、多模式）与五种威慑机制（硬威慑、情境威慑、软威慑、综合威慑、混合威慑）相对应，为理解平台如何应对虚假信息提供了宏观视角。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前社交媒体平台针对虚假信息采取了多种干预措施，但缺乏一个统一的宏观理论框架来解释这些措施如何独立和协同运作。

Method: 基于威慑理论，借鉴国际关系、军事、网络安全和公共卫生领域的经验，提出了一个干预措施与威慑机制的双元分类法。

Result: 成功将五种平台干预措施映射到五种威慑机制：移除对应硬威慑、减少对应情境威慑、告知对应软威慑、复合对应综合威慑、多模式对应混合威慑。

Conclusion: 这种映射揭示了平台如何应用不同程度的威慑机制来影响用户行为，为理解平台干预措施提供了系统的理论框架。

Abstract: In response to the escalating threat of misinformation, social media
platforms have introduced a wide range of interventions aimed at reducing the
spread and influence of false information. However, there is a lack of a
coherent macrolevel perspective that explains how these interventions operate
independently and collectively. To address this gap, I offer a dual typology
through a spectrum of interventions aligned with deterrence theory and drawing
parallels from international relations, military, cybersecurity, and public
health. I argue that five major types of platform interventions, including
removal, reduction, informing, composite, and multimodal, can be mapped to five
corresponding deterrence mechanisms, including hard, situational, soft,
integrated, and mixed deterrence based on purpose and perceptibility. These
mappings illuminate how platforms apply varying degrees of deterrence
mechanisms to influence user behavior.

### [187] [Does Capital Dream of Artificial Labour?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16042)
*Marcin Korecki,Cesare Carissimo*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 该论文提出"timenergy"（时间与能量的融合）概念，将劳动定义为商品化的timenergy扩展，与能够积累和抽象的资本形成对比。通过博弈论和基于代理的模拟，揭示了资本在组织生产过程中的优势地位。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究劳动作为timenergy表达的概念，探索其在资本体系中的异化和从属地位，特别是在自动化和人工智能时代背景下。

Method: 使用博弈论和基于代理的模拟方法，建模资本与劳动在柯布-道格拉斯生产函数控制的生产过程中的互动。

Result: 模拟结果显示，尽管理论上对称，学习代理不成比例地倾向于资本密集型过程，揭示了资本因其积累能力而具有更强的组织影响力。

Conclusion: 资本是一个由其所消耗的活劳动激活的人工生命系统，研究质疑在日益自动化的未来，生命是否能在没有资本基础设施的情况下维持自身。

Abstract: This paper investigates the concept of Labour as an expression of `timenergy'
- a fusion of time and energy - and its entanglement within the system of
Capital. We define Labour as the commodified, quantifiable expansion of
timenergy, in contrast to Capital, which is capable of accumulation and
abstraction. We explore Labour's historical evolution, its coercive and
alienating nature, and its transformation through automation and artificial
intelligence. Using a game-theoretic, agent-based simulation, we model
interactions between Capital and Labour in production processes governed by
Cobb-Douglas functions. Our results show that despite theoretical symmetry,
learning agents disproportionately gravitate toward capital-intensive
processes, revealing Capital's superior organizational influence due to its
accumulative capacity. We argue that Capital functions as an artificially alive
system animated by the living Labour it consumes, and question whether life can
sustain itself without the infrastructures of Capital in a future of increasing
automation. This study offers both a critique of and a framework for
understanding Labour's subjugation within the Capital system.

*David Atkinson*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 论文批判开源生成式AI的伦理和法律豁免主张，指出开源不等于自动合规，并主张对开源开发者适用与其他技术参与者相同的标准，同时为合法非商业研究提供有限安全港。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 针对当前开源GenAI实体声称其因开源而自动具备伦理和法律正当性的观点进行批判，揭示这种"开源例外主义"的缺陷。

Method: 通过批判性分析开源GenAI的常见辩护理由，揭示其如何无意中助长非法行为和环境破坏，并分析"民主化"和"创新"修辞的战略性运用。

Result: 证明当代开源GenAI未能真正打破寡头垄断，反而可能促进不当行为，开源开发者的监管豁免主张缺乏依据。

Conclusion: 主张在既定伦理和法律边界内追求开放性的负责任AI开发框架，开源开发者应承担同等责任，但为非商业科学研究提供有条件的安全港保护。

Abstract: Any argument that open-source generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) is
inherently ethical or legal solely because it is open source is flawed. Yet,
this is the explicit or implicit stance of several open-source GenAI entities.
This paper critically examines prevalent justifications for "open-source
exceptionalism," demonstrating how contemporary open-source GenAI often
inadvertently facilitates unlawful conduct and environmental degradation
without genuinely disrupting established oligopolies. Furthermore, the paper
exposes the unsubstantiated and strategic deployment of "democratization" and
"innovation" rhetoric to advocate for regulatory exemptions not afforded to
proprietary systems.
  The conclusion is that open-source developers must be held to the same legal
and ethical standards as all other actors in the technological ecosystem.
However, the paper proposes a narrowly tailored safe harbor designed to protect
legitimate, non-commercial scientific research, contingent upon adherence to
specific criteria. Ultimately, this paper advocates for a framework of
responsible AI development, wherein openness is pursued within established
ethical and legal boundaries, with due consideration for its broader societal
implications.

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 论文主张网站所有者有权排除他人访问其网站，当GenAI爬虫绕过技术障碍进行数据抓取时，可能构成动产侵害。法院应关注网站作为数字资产的价值损害，而非仅关注服务器损害或用户干扰。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前法院过分关注网站内容而非网站本身作为数字财产的性质，导致对大规模数据抓取缺乏有效监管。版权优先原则限制了可用诉讼主张，需要重新激活动产侵害作为有效诉讼理由。

Method: 通过将分析焦点从内容转向网站作为整体数字资产，论证网站应被视为个人财产，从而适用动产侵害原则。主张当抓取行为导致网站价值下降时，应适用动产侵害。

Result: 承认网站为个人财产可复活动产侵害作为有意义的诉讼理由，为网站所有者提供可执行的排除权，抑制剥削性抓取行为。

Conclusion: 重申网站所有者的排除权对于维护公平和可持续的在线环境至关重要，有助于保护内容创作激励、隐私和个人数据，以及自主权和表达价值。

Abstract: This paper argues that website owners have the right to exclude others from
their websites. Accordingly, when generative AI (GenAI) scraping bots
intentionally circumvent reasonable technological barriers, their conduct could
be actionable as trespass to chattels. If the scraping leads to a decrease in
the website's value, then trespass to chattels should apply. The prevailing
judicial focus on website content and the dismissal of trespass claims absent
proof of server impairment or user disruption misconstrues the nature of the
website itself as a form of digital property, focusing too narrowly on what
constitutes harm under a claim of trespass. By shifting analysis from content
to the website itself as an integrated digital asset and illustrating the harm
to the value of the chattel, this paper demonstrates that the right to exclude
applies online with the same force as it does to tangible property.
  Courts and litigants have struggled to police large-scale scraping because
copyright preemption narrows available claims, leaving copyright and its fair
use defense as the primary battleground. In contrast, recognizing websites as
personal property revives trespass to chattels as a meaningful cause of action,
providing website owners with an enforceable exclusionary right. Such
protection would disincentivize exploitative scraping, preserve incentives for
content creation, aid in protecting privacy and personal data, and safeguard
values of autonomy and expression. Ultimately, this paper contends that
reaffirming website owners' right to exclude is essential to maintaining a fair
and sustainable online environment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 教育成本上升、课程相关性、学生参与度以及快速变化的技术进步导致教育机构面临学生保留率问题。微证书作为短期学术课程，缺乏机构间的学分转移标准化，阻碍了其向更大资格认证的转化。

Method: 开发了一个基于Hyper-ledger Fabric平台的微证书验证原型模型，结合链下技术作为中间存储平台。学习者提供微证书给系统，验证机构验证证书后，教育机构根据评估标准审核并提供课程豁免。

Result: 通过链下和链上技术的结合，减少了区块链拥堵，提高了交易速度，实现了安全的微证书验证和更高效的课程豁免流程。

Conclusion: 区块链技术为微证书提供了去中心化和不可篡改的存储验证平台，该研究提出的原型系统能有效解决微证书学分转移的标准化问题，提升教育机构的运营效率。

Abstract: Student retention is one of the rising problems seen in educational
institutions. With the rising cost of education and issues in the education
sector, such as curriculum relevance, student engagement, and rapidly changing
technological advancements, ensuring the relevance of academic programs in a
fast-evolving job market has created a significant concern for educational
institutions. With the intent to adapt to such challenges, educational
institutions are dealing with alternative solutions for education, in which
micro-credentials are at the very center of this, which are short-term academic
programs or standalone courses. However, one of the challenges of
micro-credentials is a lack of credit transfer among institutions. With the
lack of standardization of assessments among educational institutions, it is
difficult to transfer micro-credentials to larger qualifications. Regarding
such challenges, micro-credentials with blockchain technology can bring
significant benefits. Blockchain technology offers a decentralized and
immutable platform for securely storing and verifying credentials. This paper
presents a prototype model for micro-credential verification. With the policies
decided by the educational institution, the learner provides a micro-credential
certificate to the system. Upon validation of the certificate by the verifying
body, the educational institution will review the assessment criteria and
provide exemptions based on the provided criteria. The prototype uses the
Hyper-ledger Fabric platform and utilizes off-chain technology, which acts as a
middle-man storage platform. With the combination of off-chain and on-chain
technologies, congestion on the blockchain is reduced, and transaction speed is
improved. In summary, this research proposes a prototype for secure
micro-credential verification and a more efficient course exemption process.

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 该研究设计了一种通过早期截止日期和额外自动化反馈来对抗计算机科学本科生编程作业拖延症的干预措施，结果显示干预能促使更多学生尽早开始作业，但只有同时使用干预获得额外反馈的学生成绩才有显著提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 计算机科学本科生普遍存在学术拖延现象，特别是在面对高年级课程中复杂的大型编程作业时，拖延会对学业表现和心理健康产生负面影响。

Method: 设计干预措施：设置早期截止日期（不计分）但提供额外自动化反馈；通过控制组与干预组的对比评估干预效果；进行半结构化访谈了解学生感知。

Result: 干预显著促使更多学生尽早开始作业；干预组内使用干预的学生成绩显著高于未使用者；访谈显示学生从干预中获益包括学业表现提升、心理健康改善和软技能发展。

Conclusion: 仅尽早开始作业不足以提升成绩，但结合早期开始和额外反馈能显著改善学生表现；学生采用干预的主要动机是获取更多反馈、满足好奇心和利用可用时间。

Abstract: Academic procrastination is prevalent among undergraduate computer science
students. Many studies have linked procrastination to poor academic performance
and well-being. Procrastination is especially detrimental for advanced students
when facing large, complex programming assignments in upper-year courses. We
designed an intervention to combat academic procrastination on such programming
assignments. The intervention consisted of early deadlines that were not worth
marks but provided additional automated feedback if students submitted their
work early. We evaluated the intervention by comparing the behaviour and
performance of students between a control group and an intervention group. Our
results showed that the intervention encouraged significantly more students to
start the assignments early. Although there was no significant difference in
students' grades between the control and intervention groups, students within
the intervention group who used the intervention achieved significantly higher
grades than those who did not. Our results implied that starting early alone
did not improve students' grades. However, starting early and receiving
additional feedback enhanced the students' grades relative to those of the rest
of the students. We also conducted semi-structured interviews to gain an
understanding of students' perceptions of the intervention. The interviews
revealed that students benefited from the intervention in numerous ways,
including improved academic performance, mental health, and development of soft
skills. Students adopted the intervention to get more feedback, satisfy their
curiosity, or use their available time. The main reasons for not adopting the
intervention include having other competing deadlines, the intervention not
being worth any marks, and feeling confident about their work.

TL;DR: 本文探讨AI代理系统在临终决策中的公平性框架，认为传统算法公平性不足以处理这种关系性、存在性和文化多样性的决策场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI代理系统用于在个人失去决策能力时推断其偏好，但该领域的公平性研究不足。传统算法公平框架无法充分处理关系性、存在性和文化多样性的决策情境。

Method: 通过将主要公平概念映射到现实世界临终场景，并考察不同道德传统中的公平观念。

Result: 研究发现AI代理系统的公平性不仅涉及结果平等，还应包括道德代表性、对患者价值观的忠实度、人际关系和世界观的考量。

Conclusion: 在AI代理系统中，公平性需要超越传统的结果平等，包含更广泛的道德和关系维度，以更好地反映患者的价值观和世界观。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence surrogates are systems designed to infer preferences
when individuals lose decision-making capacity. Fairness in such systems is a
domain that has been insufficiently explored. Traditional algorithmic fairness
frameworks are insufficient for contexts where decisions are relational,
existential, and culturally diverse. This paper explores an ethical framework
for algorithmic fairness in AI surrogates by mapping major fairness notions
onto potential real-world end-of-life scenarios. It then examines fairness
across moral traditions. The authors argue that fairness in this domain extends
beyond parity of outcomes to encompass moral representation, fidelity to the
patient's values, relationships, and worldview.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 跨学科设计项目规划对教师来说耗时且认知要求高，需要课程对齐、跨学科整合和精心排序，而教师工作压力持续存在，需要规划支持工具。

Method: 采用基于GPT的IDPplanner规划助手，结合设计创新原则和新加坡中学课程标准，通过33名在职教师的对比实验，让教师分别进行手动和AI辅助的项目规划，并使用六维评分标准进行自评和互评。

Result: AI辅助版本在课程对齐、设计思维应用和连贯性方面得分更高，在评估策略方面略有优势。教师反馈显示AI辅助改善了结构、排序和创意生成，但情境化调整仍需教师主导。

Conclusion: AI可以作为教学规划伙伴，建议采用教师-AI混合工作流程来增强课程对齐并减少规划复杂性，同时为开发者提供加强情境定制、迭代设计支持和本地化评分标准的建议。

Abstract: Creating interdisciplinary design projects is time-consuming and cognitively
demanding for teachers, requiring curriculum alignment, cross-subject
integration, and careful sequencing. International research reports increasing
teacher use of AI alongside persistent workload pressures, underscoring the
need for planning support. This paper presents the Interdisciplinary Design
Project Planner (IDPplanner), a GPT-based planning assistant grounded in Design
Innovation principles, alignment with Singapore secondary school syllabuses,
and 21st-century competencies. In a within-subject, counterbalanced workshop
with 33 in-service teachers, participants produced two versions of the same
project: manual and AI-assisted, followed by self- and peer-evaluations using a
six-dimensional rubric. The AI-assisted version received higher scores for
Curriculum Alignment, Design Thinking Application, and Coherence and Flow, with
a marginal advantage for Assessment Strategies. Teacher reflections indicated
that AI-assisted planning improved structure, sequencing, and idea generation,
while contextualization to local syllabuses, class profiles, and student needs
remained teacher-led. Contributions include a purpose-built planning tool that
organizes ideas into a ten-component flow with ready-to-adapt prompts,
templates, and assessment suggestions; an empirical, rubric-based comparison of
planning quality; and evidence that AI can function as a pedagogical planning
partner. Recommendations emphasize hybrid teacher-AI workflows to enhance
curriculum alignment and reduce planning complexity, and design suggestions for
developers to strengthen contextual customization, iterative design support,
and localized rubrics. Although instantiated with a Singapore-based curriculum,
the planning flow and rubric are framework-agnostic and can be parameterized
for other systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着创意思维教育的发展，传统基于评分标准的评估方法在大规模多班级教学中存在劳动密集、耗时且不一致的问题，需要探索更有效的评估方式。

Method: 对33名新加坡教育部教师进行两项活动：比较AI生成分数与助教评分在三个关键维度（同理心与用户理解、痛点识别、视觉传达）的一致性；调查教师对AI评分、助教评分和混合评分的偏好。

Result: AI与教师评分在同理心和痛点维度统计一致性低，视觉传达维度一致性稍高；教师在10个样本中有6个更偏好助教评分；定性反馈显示AI在形成性反馈、一致性和学生自我反思方面有潜力，但缺乏情境细微差别和创意洞察力。

Conclusion: 需要整合计算效率与人类洞察力的混合评估模型，在创意学科中平衡自动化与人类判断，实现可扩展且教学合理的评估。

Abstract: As design thinking education grows in secondary and tertiary contexts,
educators face the challenge of evaluating creative artefacts that combine
visual and textual elements. Traditional rubric-based assessment is laborious,
time-consuming, and inconsistent due to reliance on Teaching Assistants (TA) in
large, multi-section cohorts. This paper presents an exploratory study
investigating the reliability and perceived accuracy of AI-assisted assessment
compared to TA-assisted assessment in evaluating student posters in design
thinking education. Two activities were conducted with 33 Ministry of Education
(MOE) Singapore school teachers to (1) compare AI-generated scores with TA
grading across three key dimensions: empathy and user understanding,
identification of pain points and opportunities, and visual communication, and
(2) examine teacher preferences for AI-assigned, TA-assigned, and hybrid
scores. Results showed low statistical agreement between instructor and AI
scores for empathy and pain points, with slightly higher alignment for visual
communication. Teachers preferred TA-assigned scores in six of ten samples.
Qualitative feedback highlighted the potential of AI for formative feedback,
consistency, and student self-reflection, but raised concerns about its
limitations in capturing contextual nuance and creative insight. The study
underscores the need for hybrid assessment models that integrate computational
efficiency with human insights. This research contributes to the evolving
conversation on responsible AI adoption in creative disciplines, emphasizing
the balance between automation and human judgment for scalable and
pedagogically sound assessment.

Abstract: While Artificial Intelligence (AI) shows promise in healthcare applications,
existing conversational systems often falter in complex and sensitive medical
domains such as Sexual and Reproductive Health (SRH). These systems frequently
struggle with hallucination and lack the specialized knowledge required,
particularly for sensitive SRH topics. Furthermore, current AI approaches in
healthcare tend to prioritize diagnostic capabilities over comprehensive
patient care and education. Addressing these gaps, this work at the UNC School
of Nursing introduces SARHAchat, a proof-of-concept Large Language Model
(LLM)-based chatbot. SARHAchat is designed as a reliable, user-centered system
integrating medical expertise with empathetic communication to enhance SRH care
delivery. Our evaluation demonstrates SARHAchat's ability to provide accurate
and contextually appropriate contraceptive counseling while maintaining a
natural conversational flow. The demo is available at

Conclusion: MoPHES通过整合心理状态评估和对话支持，提供了更个性化的心理健康服务，同时保护用户隐私。

Abstract: The 2022 World Mental Health Report calls for global mental health care
reform, amid rising prevalence of issues like anxiety and depression that
affect nearly one billion people worldwide. Traditional in-person therapy fails
to meet this demand, and the situation is worsened by stigma. While
general-purpose large language models (LLMs) offer efficiency for AI-driven
mental health solutions, they underperform because they lack specialized
fine-tuning. Existing LLM-based mental health chatbots can engage in empathetic
conversations, but they overlook real-time user mental state assessment which
is critical for professional counseling. This paper proposes MoPHES, a
framework that integrates mental state evaluation, conversational support, and
professional treatment recommendations. The agent developed under this
framework uses two fine-tuned MiniCPM4-0.5B LLMs: one is fine-tuned on mental
health conditions datasets to assess users' mental states and predict the
severity of anxiety and depression; the other is fine-tuned on multi-turn
dialogues to handle conversations with users. By leveraging insights into
users' mental states, our agent provides more tailored support and professional
treatment recommendations. Both models are also deployed directly on mobile
devices to enhance user convenience and protect user privacy. Additionally, to
evaluate the performance of MoPHES with other LLMs, we develop a benchmark for
the automatic evaluation of mental state prediction and multi-turn counseling
dialogues, which includes comprehensive evaluation metrics, datasets, and
methods.

Motivation: 解决传统代理模型缺乏语义理解和LLM代理计算成本过高的问题

Method: 使用LLM代理模拟核心用户进行语义推理，扩散模型高效处理剩余用户，两者通过协调模拟过程交互

Result: 在三个真实数据集上的实验表明，该框架在预测准确性上优于现有方法

Conclusion: 混合框架通过模块化设计有效平衡了语义理解能力和计算效率

Abstract: Agent-based social simulation provides a valuable methodology for predicting
social information diffusion, yet existing approaches face two primary
limitations. Traditional agent models often rely on rigid behavioral rules and
lack semantic understanding of textual content, while emerging large language
model (LLM)-based agents incur prohibitive computational costs at scale. To
address these challenges, we propose a hybrid simulation framework that
strategically integrates LLM-driven agents with diffusion model-based agents.
The framework employs LLM-based agents to simulate a core subset of users with
rich semantic reasoning, while a diffusion model handles the remaining
population efficiently. Although the two agent types operate on disjoint user
groups, both incorporate key factors including user personalization, social
influence, and content awareness, and interact through a coordinated simulation
process. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate that
our framework outperforms existing methods in prediction accuracy, validating
the effectiveness of its modular design.

(DT) could have an impact on the well-being of employees. The jobs of the
employees became more demanding, and they were expected to learn ICT skills and
cope with ICT workloads and hassles. Due to negative stereotypes about women's
deficiency in technology, these ICT problems could affect female and male
employees differently. Thus, we predicted that this additional pressure may
manifest itself in higher levels of digital transformation stress (DTS) in
female employees. The results confirmed this prediction and indicated the
existence of a gender gap in DTS, measured two-fold - in sentiment analysis of
help desk tickets and self-report using a psychological scale. Based on these
results, we explore the need to discuss possible solutions and tools to support
women in ICT-heavy workplace contexts.

Abstract: Computational Thinking (CT) has emerged as a critical component in modern
education, essential to equip students with the skills necessary to thrive in a
technology-driven world. This survey provides a comprehensive analysis of the
presence and integration of CT in school curricula across various countries. In
addition, this study categorizes digital tools into groups such as visual
programming, textual programming, electronic games, modeling, and simulation,
assessing their use in different educational settings. Furthermore, it examines
how these tools are employed in various contexts, including the areas of
knowledge and age groups they target, and the specific skills they help
develop. The research also identifies key CT competencies that have been
improved through these tools, including Cognitive and Analytical Competencies
(CAC), Technical and Computational Competencies (TCC) and Social and Emotional
Competencies (SEC). Furthermore, the study highlights recurring challenges in
the implementation of digital tools for CT development, such as inadequate
infrastructure, difficulties in the usability of the tool, teacher training,
adapting pedagogical practices, and measuring student CT skills. Finally, it
proposes areas for future research to address these challenges and advance CT
education.

### [200] [Agentic Inequality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16853)
*Matthew Sharp,Omer Bilgin,Iason Gabriel,Lewis Hammond*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 本文提出并探讨了'代理不平等'概念，即由AI代理的获取和能力的差异导致的权力、机会和结果的不平等。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着自主AI代理系统融入政治经济生活，其分布和能力差异将产生重大影响，需要分析这种新型技术不平等现象。

Method: 建立分析框架，从可用性、质量和数量三个维度分析代理不平等；论证代理不平等与传统技术鸿沟的区别；系统分析技术和社会经济驱动因素。

Result: 识别了代理不平等在三个核心维度的表现，阐明了其作为自主代理而非工具增强的本质特征，并分析了影响代理权力分布的关键因素。

Conclusion: 代理不平等是一种新型技术鸿沟，需要制定研究议程来应对复杂治理挑战，确保AI代理技术既能促进平等又不会加剧现有分化。

Abstract: Autonomous AI agents, capable of complex planning and action, represent a
significant technological evolution beyond current generative tools. As these
systems become integrated into political and economic life, their distribution
and capabilities will be highly consequential. This paper introduces and
explores "agentic inequality" - the potential disparities in power,
opportunity, and outcomes stemming from differential access to, and
capabilities of, AI agents. We analyse the dual potential of this technology,
exploring how agents could both exacerbate existing divides and, under the
right conditions, serve as a powerful equalising force. To this end, the paper
makes three primary contributions. First, it establishes an analytical
framework by delineating the three core dimensions through which this
inequality can manifest: disparities in the availability, quality, and quantity
of agents. Second, it argues that agentic inequality is distinct from prior
technological divides. Unlike tools that primarily augment human abilities,
agents act as autonomous delegates, creating novel power asymmetries through
scalable goal delegation and direct agent-to-agent competition that are poised
to reshape outcomes across economic and socio-political spheres. Finally, it
provides a systematic analysis of the technical and socioeconomic drivers -
from model release strategies to market incentives - that will shape the
distribution of agentic power, concluding with a research agenda for navigating
the complex governance challenges ahead.

*Enes Ayalp*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: CLEAR CORE是一个创意技术领域的学习框架，通过两个相互关联的迭代循环将结构化教育与独立成长相结合，帮助专业人士在不断变化的环境中持续发展。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 创意技术领域发展迅速，现有教育路径往往无法连接所学技能，导致学习者专业知识碎片化且容易过时。行业需要深度专业知识，但专业化在技术快速变化时存在风险，而广泛技能集又容易被技术变革取代。

Method: CLEAR CORE框架整合了两个迭代的相互关联循环，形成一个持续过程，将结构化教育与独立成长联系起来，作为终身的、可更新的实践。

Result: 该框架旨在帮助创意技术专业人士在不断变化的环境中脱颖而出，通过持续的学习和发展过程来应对技术变革和市场变化。

Conclusion: CLEAR CORE提供了一个可持续的学习和发展方法，使创意技术专业人士能够在技术快速演进的环境中保持竞争力，将教育与实践紧密结合，形成终身学习的循环。

Abstract: The creative technology evolves rapidly in both scope and depth, demanding
cross-disciplinary expertise and continuous improvement. Although educational
programs and other collaborative initiatives enable strong technical and
artistic skills, even the most advanced pathways rarely ensure a stable career.
Success in these professions often depends on visibility, timing, and
self-directed development. As markets shift or technologies change, talents
still find themselves displaced. Existing learning paths often fail to connect
the skills they teach, leaving learners with fragmented expertise that decays
quickly when not continuously applied. The industry demands depth, yet
specialization carries risk when tools, pipelines, or roles evolve faster than
the expertise built around them. Broad skill sets, by contrast, may increase
employability but are easily replaced or rendered obsolete by technological
change. CLEAR CORE is a framework for learning and sustaining in creative
technology. It integrates two iterative interconnected cycles into a continuous
process linking structured education with independent growth as a lifelong,
renewable practice that allows professionals to excel amid constant change.

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: VERA系统是一个概念建模工具，将概念建模与基于代理的模拟相结合，通过将模型的可视化语法编译为NetLogo可执行代码，为生物学学生提供模型质量反馈。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在建构主义教育实践中，概念建模在STEM领域很重要，但很少使用基于代理的模拟来为学生提供模型质量反馈。这需要将概念模型自动编译成模拟的能力。

Method: 开发VERA系统，将概念模型的可视化语法编译成可在NetLogo模拟引擎上执行的代码，实现概念建模与基于代理模拟的耦合。

Result: VERA自2016年以来在多个大学的生物学入门课程和史密森尼学会的生命百科全书网站中使用，提供了概念建模和基于代理模拟的能力。

Conclusion: VERA成功地将概念建模与基于代理的模拟相结合，通过自动编译机制为生物学学生提供了有效的模型质量反馈工具。

Abstract: Conceptual modeling has been an important part of constructionist educational
practices for many years, particularly in STEM (Science, Technology,
Engineering and Mathematics) disciplines. What is not so common is using
agent-based simulation to provide students feedback on model quality. This
requires the capability of automatically compiling the concept model into its
simulation. The VERA (Virtual Experimentation Research Assistant) system is a
conceptual modeling tool used since 2016 to provide introductory college
biology students with the capability of conceptual modeling and agent-based
simulation in the ecological domain. This paper describes VERA and its approach
to coupling conceptual modeling and simulation with emphasis on how a model's
visual syntax is compiled into code executable on a NetLogo simulation engine.
Experience with VERA in introductory biology classes at several universities
and through the Smithsonian Institution's Encyclopedia of Life website is
related.

Motivation: 随着数字时代的发展，创建恶意网站传播虚假信息变得更容易。美国最近出现了一种现象：创建虚假本地新闻网站来推进信息操作活动。

Method: 通过回顾分析7个案例，分解这些网站的运作方式，发现它们在方法上的共性。

Result: 发现这些虚假新闻网站的共同策略：复活之前建立的真实本地新闻机构的"僵尸"报纸、在社交媒体上分享这些网站、使用WordPress网站模板。

Conclusion: 通过分析这些共性，提出了未来减轻此类活动发生的应对方法。

Abstract: In the rise of the digital era, it's easier than ever to create nefarious
websites to spread misinformation. A more recent phenomenon in the United
States has been the creation of inauthentic local news websites to further an
information operation campaign. This paper is a review of the 7 instances in
which local news websites were created to influence residents of a region
between 2007 and 2024. By breaking down the ways in which these sites operated,
we discovered commonalities in the approach - resurrecting "zombie" papers that
were previously established authentic local news organizations, sharing these
sites on social media, and using website templates from WordPress. By analyzing
these commonalities, we propose ways to mitigate the occurrence of these
campaigns in the future.

TL;DR: 提出了一个用于分析可见性分配系统(VAS)的形式化框架，这些系统是决定向用户展示哪些(处理过的)数据的(半)自动化系统。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前算法系统复杂、结构不明确且难以预测下游影响，使得研究人员和立法者难以全面理解和评估这些系统。

Method: 引入VAS形式化框架，将系统分解为子过程并用数据流图表示，同时调研了整个流程中的评估指标。

Result: 通过学校选择中的预测推荐案例研究，展示了该框架如何支持VAS评估，并讨论了其在AI立法中的应用。

Conclusion: 该框架有助于系统诊断、定位义务、量化系统性风险，并支持适应性合规。

Abstract: Throughout application domains, we now rely extensively on algorithmic
systems to engage with ever-expanding datasets of information. Despite their
benefits, these systems are often complex (comprising of many intricate tools,
e.g., moderation, recommender systems, prediction models), of unknown structure
(due to the lack of accompanying documentation), and having hard-to-predict yet
potentially severe downstream consequences (due to the extensive use,
systematic enactment of existing errors, and many comprising feedback loops).
As such, understanding and evaluating these systems as a whole remains a
challenge for both researchers and legislators. To aid ongoing efforts, we
introduce a formal framework for such visibility allocation systems (VASs)
which we define as (semi-)automated systems deciding which (processed) data to
present a human user with. We review typical tools comprising VASs and define
the associated computational problems they solve. By doing so, VASs can be
decomposed into sub-processes and illustrated via data flow diagrams. Moreover,
we survey metrics for evaluating VASs throughout the pipeline, thus aiding
system diagnostics. Using forecasting-based recommendations in school choice as
a case study, we demonstrate how our framework can support VAS evaluation. We
also discuss how our framework can support ongoing AI-legislative efforts to
locate obligations, quantify systemic risks, and enable adaptive compliance.

*Aditi Dutta*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 开发了一个基于多语言transformer模型的定量气候政策导向指标，通过分析官方政策文件来评估不同气候政策领域（减缓、适应、灾害风险管理、损失与损害）的优先级及其对发展成果的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有气候政策评估主要依赖定性描述或综合指数，难以揭示不同政策领域（减缓、适应、灾害风险管理、损失与损害）之间的关键差异及其具体发展影响。

Method: 应用多语言transformer语言模型分析官方国家政策文件，构建气候政策导向定量指标，并与世界银行发展数据进行面板回归分析。

Result: 分类准确率达到0.90（F1分数）；减缓政策与更高的GDP和GNI相关；灾害风险管理与更大的GNI和债务相关但减少外国直接投资；适应和损失与损害政策的影响有限。

Conclusion: 该集成NLP-计量经济学框架提供了可比较的、主题特定的气候治理分析，为监测进展、评估权衡和调整政策重点提供了可扩展的方法。

Abstract: Addressing climate change effectively requires more than cataloguing the
number of policies in place; it calls for tools that can reveal their thematic
priorities and their tangible impacts on development outcomes. Existing
assessments often rely on qualitative descriptions or composite indices, which
can mask crucial differences between key domains such as mitigation,
adaptation, disaster risk management, and loss and damage. To bridge this gap,
we develop a quantitative indicator of climate policy orientation by applying a
multilingual transformer-based language model to official national policy
documents, achieving a classification accuracy of 0.90 (F1-score). Linking
these indicators with World Bank development data in panel regressions reveals
that mitigation policies are associated with higher GDP and GNI; disaster risk
management correlates with greater GNI and debt but reduced foreign direct
investment; adaptation and loss and damage show limited measurable effects.
This integrated NLP-econometric framework enables comparable, theme-specific
analysis of climate governance, offering a scalable method to monitor progress,
evaluate trade-offs, and align policy emphasis with development goals.

*Frederik Zuiderveen Borgesius*

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 本文主张数据保护法应适用于行为定向营销，即使公司未将姓名与个人数据关联，只要通过数据识别出特定个人，就应视为处理个人数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 行为定向营销公司声称只要不将姓名与个人数据关联，就不处理个人数据，因此数据保护法不适用。但欧洲数据保护机构认为，只要使用数据识别出特定个人，就应视为处理个人数据。

Method: 通过法律分析和逻辑论证，探讨行为定向营销中个人数据的定义范围，以及数据保护法的适用性。

Result: 论证表明行为定向营销确实涉及个人数据处理，姓名只是众多标识符之一，并非最实用的标识符。通过数据识别出特定个人就构成个人数据处理。

Conclusion: 数据保护法应适用于行为定向营销，因为其核心是收集个人信息、识别个人并向个人投放广告，无论是否关联姓名，都存在隐私风险。

Abstract: Information about millions of people is collected for behavioural targeting,
a type of marketing that involves tracking people's online behaviour for
targeted advertising. It is hotly debated whether data protection law applies
to behavioural targeting. Many behavioural targeting companies say that, as
long as they do not tie names to data they hold about individuals, they do not
process any personal data, and that, therefore, data protection law does not
apply to them. European Data Protection Authorities, however, take the view
that a company processes personal data if it uses data to single out a person,
even if it cannot tie a name to these data. This paper argues that data
protection law should indeed apply to behavioural targeting. Companies can
often tie a name to nameless data about individuals. Furthermore, behavioural
targeting relies on collecting information about individuals, singling out
individuals, and targeting ads to individuals. Many privacy risks remain,
regardless of whether companies tie a name to the information they hold about a
person. A name is merely one of the identifiers that can be tied to data about
a person, and it is not even the most practical identifier for behavioural
targeting. Seeing data used to single out a person as personal data fits the
rationale for data protection law: protecting fairness and privacy.

Motivation: AI虽然为人类带来巨大机遇，但其嵌入和延续偏见与歧视的潜力构成了最紧迫的挑战之一，需要系统性地研究算法决策带来的歧视风险。

Method: 由Prof. Frederik Zuiderveen Borgesius为欧洲委员会反歧视部门准备的研究报告，通过系统分析阐述算法决策和其他类型AI造成的歧视风险。

Result: 研究详细阐述了AI系统可能导致的歧视问题，特别是在算法决策过程中可能嵌入和延续社会偏见。

Conclusion: AI的歧视风险是需要高度重视的社会问题，需要采取有效措施来应对算法决策可能带来的歧视性影响。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) has a huge impact on our personal lives and also
on our democratic society as a whole. While AI offers vast opportunities for
the benefit of people, its potential to embed and perpetuate bias and

TL;DR: 本文分析了在线政治微定向对民主的承诺与威胁，探讨了其优化选举匹配和提升参与度的潜力，同时也指出了误导性宣传和隐私问题，并为政策制定者提供了监管建议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着在线政治微定向在美国的广泛应用，欧洲可能紧随其后，需要系统评估这种技术对民主的潜在影响，包括其积极承诺和负面威胁。

Method: 通过映射分析的方法，系统梳理在线政治微定向对民主的承诺（如优化选举匹配、提升参与度）和威胁（如误导性宣传、隐私侵犯），并探讨监管可能性。

Result: 识别出微定向既能优化政治传播效果，也可能被滥用于误导选民和侵犯隐私，需要在保障言论自由的前提下制定适当监管措施。

Conclusion: 在线政治微定向是一把双刃剑，政策制定者需要在促进民主参与和保护民主价值之间找到平衡，通过符合欧洲人权公约的监管框架来应对相关挑战。

Abstract: Online political microtargeting involves monitoring people's online
behaviour, and using the collected data, sometimes enriched with other data, to
show people-targeted political advertisements. Online political microtargeting
is widely used in the US; Europe may not be far behind. This paper maps
microtargeting's promises and threats to democracy. For example, microtargeting
promises to optimise the match between the electorate's concerns and political
campaigns, and to boost campaign engagement and political participation. But
online microtargeting could also threaten democracy. For instance, a political
party could, misleadingly, present itself as a different one-issue party to
different individuals. And data collection for microtargeting raises privacy
concerns. We sketch possibilities for policymakers if they seek to regulate
online political microtargeting. We discuss which measures would be possible,
while complying with the right to freedom of expression under the European
Convention on Human Rights.

*Eden Shaveet,Crystal Su,Daniel Hsu,Luis Gravano*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: 该研究分析了Yelp评论中的食源性疾病信号与纽约市官方餐厅检查结果之间的关系，发现在人口普查区层面两者相关性很小。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 食源性疾病是严重的公共卫生问题，餐厅是调查疫情的关键场所。社交媒体评论可能提供比正式报告更及时的公共卫生信号。

Method: 使用分层S型注意力网络(HSAN)分类器分析Yelp评论信号，并与纽约市卫生部门2023年的官方餐厅检查结果进行比较，在人口普查区层面评估相关性。

Result: 在人口普查区层面，HSAN信号与检查分数之间相关性很小，且C级餐厅数量不同的区域在HSAN分数分布上没有显著差异。

Conclusion: 社交媒体评论信号与官方检查结果在宏观层面相关性有限，需要进一步进行地址级别的分析来探索两者关系。

Abstract: Foodborne illnesses are gastrointestinal conditions caused by consuming
contaminated food. Restaurants are critical venues to investigate outbreaks
because they share sourcing, preparation, and distribution of foods. Public
reporting of illness via formal channels is limited, whereas social media
platforms host abundant user-generated content that can provide timely public
health signals. This paper analyzes signals from Yelp reviews produced by a
Hierarchical Sigmoid Attention Network (HSAN) classifier and compares them with
official restaurant inspection outcomes issued by the New York City Department
of Health and Mental Hygiene (NYC DOHMH) in 2023. We evaluate correlations at
the Census tract level, compare distributions of HSAN scores by prevalence of
C-graded restaurants, and map spatial patterns across NYC. We find minimal
correlation between HSAN signals and inspection scores at the tract level and
no significant differences by number of C-graded restaurants. We discuss
implications and outline next steps toward address-level analyses.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索如何有效利用词汇和神经两种不同类型的相关性信号来提升检索效果，解决单一方法可能存在的局限性。

Method: 采用两阶段架构：第一阶段使用神经检索器进行初步检索，第二阶段使用基于决策树森林的学习排序模型，融合253个手工特征和神经表示来重排序候选文档。

Result: 实验显示该方法显著提升端到端排序性能，nDCG@10提升最高达11%，而平均查询延迟仅增加4.3%。

Conclusion: 无缝结合两种不同信号家族能够相互补充，显著提升检索效果，同时相对最小化效率影响。

Abstract: We investigate the exploitation of both lexical and neural relevance signals
for ad-hoc passage retrieval. Our exploration involves a large-scale training
dataset in which dense neural representations of MS-MARCO queries and passages
are complemented and integrated with 253 hand-crafted lexical features
extracted from the same corpus. Blending of the relevance signals from the two
different groups of features is learned by a classical Learning-to-Rank (LTR)
model based on a forest of decision trees. To evaluate our solution, we employ
a pipelined architecture where a dense neural retriever serves as the first
stage and performs a nearest-neighbor search over the neural representations of
the documents. Our LTR model acts instead as the second stage that re-ranks the
set of candidates retrieved by the first stage to enhance effectiveness. The
results of reproducible experiments conducted with state-of-the-art dense
retrievers on publicly available resources show that the proposed solution
significantly enhances the end-to-end ranking performance while relatively
minimally impacting efficiency. Specifically, we achieve a boost in nDCG@10 of
up to 11% with an increase in average query latency of only 4.3%. This confirms
the advantage of seamlessly combining two distinct families of signals that
mutually contribute to retrieval effectiveness.

Motivation: 解决审稿人推荐研究中缺乏高质量基准数据集的问题，现有数据集通常在规模、学科范围和比较分析方面存在局限。

Method: 构建了基于Frontiers平台真实同行评审记录的大规模数据集，并进行了全面的评估，比较了基于内容的方法和协同过滤方法。

Result: 基于内容的方法显著优于协同过滤，语言模型方法在捕捉论文内容与审稿人专业知识的语义对齐方面特别有效，并确定了优化推荐流程的最佳聚合策略。

Conclusion: FRONTIER-RevRec可作为审稿人推荐研究的综合基准，促进更有效的学术同行评审系统的发展。

Abstract: Reviewer recommendation is a critical task for enhancing the efficiency of
academic publishing workflows. However, research in this area has been
persistently hindered by the lack of high-quality benchmark datasets, which are
often limited in scale, disciplinary scope, and comparative analyses of
different methodologies. To address this gap, we introduce FRONTIER-RevRec, a
large-scale dataset constructed from authentic peer review records (2007-2025)
from the Frontiers open-access publishing platform
https://www.frontiersin.org/. The dataset contains 177941 distinct reviewers
and 478379 papers across 209 journals spanning multiple disciplines including
clinical medicine, biology, psychology, engineering, and social sciences. Our
comprehensive evaluation on this dataset reveals that content-based methods
significantly outperform collaborative filtering. This finding is explained by
our structural analysis, which uncovers fundamental differences between
academic recommendation and commercial domains. Notably, approaches leveraging
language models are particularly effective at capturing the semantic alignment
between a paper's content and a reviewer's expertise. Furthermore, our
experiments identify optimal aggregation strategies to enhance the
recommendation pipeline. FRONTIER-RevRec is intended to serve as a
comprehensive benchmark to advance research in reviewer recommendation and
facilitate the development of more effective academic peer review systems. The

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RAG方法主要基于语义而忽略显式时间约束，导致时间不一致的答案和过高的token使用量。

Method: 构建时间对齐规则图，并在该图上进行传播以缩小搜索空间，优先选择语义相关且时间一致的证据。

Result: 在真实世界时间知识图谱数据集上的实验表明，该方法在消耗更少token的同时实现了更高的答案准确性。

Conclusion: STAR-RAG无需繁重的模型训练和微调，降低了计算成本并显著简化了部署，相比现有时间RAG方法具有优势。

Abstract: Question answering in temporal knowledge graphs requires retrieval that is
both time-consistent and efficient. Existing RAG methods are largely semantic
and typically neglect explicit temporal constraints, which leads to
time-inconsistent answers and inflated token usage. We propose STAR-RAG, a
temporal GraphRAG framework that relies on two key ideas: building a
time-aligned rule graph and conducting propagation on this graph to narrow the
search space and prioritize semantically relevant, time-consistent evidence.
This design enforces temporal proximity during retrieval, reduces the candidate
set of retrieval results, and lowers token consumption without sacrificing
accuracy. Compared with existing temporal RAG approaches, STAR-RAG eliminates
the need for heavy model training and fine-tuning, thereby reducing
computational cost and significantly simplifying deployment.Extensive
experiments on real-world temporal KG datasets show that our method achieves
improved answer accuracy while consuming fewer tokens than strong GraphRAG
baselines.

Abstract: This paper investigates the usage of FPGA devices for energy-efficient exact
kNN search in high-dimension latent spaces. This work intercepts a relevant
trend that tries to support the increasing popularity of learned
representations based on neural encoder models by making their large-scale
adoption greener and more inclusive. The paper proposes two different
energy-efficient solutions adopting the same FPGA low-level configuration. The
first solution maximizes system throughput by processing the queries of a batch
in parallel over a streamed dataset not fitting into the FPGA memory. The
second minimizes latency by processing each kNN incoming query in parallel over
an in-memory dataset. Reproducible experiments on publicly available image and
text datasets show that our solution outperforms state-of-the-art CPU-based
competitors regarding throughput, latency, and energy consumption.
Specifically, experiments show that the proposed FPGA solutions achieve the
best throughput in terms of queries per second and the best-observed latency
with scale-up factors of up to 16.6X. Similar considerations can be made
regarding energy efficiency, where results show that our solutions can achieve
up to 11.9X energy saving w.r.t. strong CPU-based competitors.

### [214] [An Efficient Framework for Whole-Page Reranking via Single-Modal Supervision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16803)
*Zishuai Zhang,Sihao Yu,Wenyi Xie,Ying Nie,Junfeng Wang,Zhiming Zheng,Dawei Yin,Hainan Zhang*

Main category: cs.IR

TL;DR: SMAR是一个新的全页重排框架，利用高质量单模态排序器指导模态间相关性对齐，仅需有限的全页标注即可超越完全标注的重排模型，显著降低标注成本70-90%的同时提升排序性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 全页重排对搜索引擎用户体验至关重要，但现有方法依赖大规模人工标注，成本高且耗时。全页标注比单模态复杂得多，需要评估整个结果页面并考虑跨模态相关性差异。如何在降低标注成本的同时提升全页重排性能是搜索引擎结果页面优化的关键挑战。

Method: 首先针对各自模态训练高质量单模态排序器；然后为每个查询选择其输出的子集构建候选页面并进行页面级人工标注；最后使用这些有限标注训练全页重排器，并通过与单模态偏好保持一致来保持各模态内的排序质量。

Result: 在Qilin和Baidu数据集上的实验表明，SMAR将标注成本降低约70-90%，同时相比基线实现显著的排序改进。在百度APP上的离线和在线A/B测试也显示标准排序指标和用户体验指标的显著提升。

Conclusion: SMAR框架在现实搜索场景中验证了其有效性和实用价值，能够以更低的标注成本实现更好的全页重排性能。

Abstract: The whole-page reranking plays a critical role in shaping the user experience
of search engines, which integrates retrieval results from multiple modalities,
such as documents, images, videos, and LLM outputs. Existing methods mainly
rely on large-scale human-annotated data, which is costly to obtain and
time-consuming. This is because whole-page annotation is far more complex than
single-modal: it requires assessing the entire result page while accounting for
cross-modal relevance differences. Thus, how to improve whole-page reranking
performance while reducing annotation costs is still a key challenge in
optimizing search engine result pages(SERP). In this paper, we propose SMAR, a
novel whole-page reranking framework that leverages strong Single-modal rankers
to guide Modal-wise relevance Alignment for effective Reranking, using only
limited whole-page annotation to outperform fully-annotated reranking models.
Specifically, high-quality single-modal rankers are first trained on data
specific to their respective modalities. Then, for each query, we select a
subset of their outputs to construct candidate pages and perform human
annotation at the page level. Finally, we train the whole-page reranker using
these limited annotations and enforcing consistency with single-modal
preferences to maintain ranking quality within each modality. Experiments on
the Qilin and Baidu datasets demonstrate that SMAR reduces annotation costs by
about 70-90\% while achieving significant ranking improvements compared to
baselines. Further offline and online A/B testing on Baidu APPs also shows
notable gains in standard ranking metrics as well as user experience
indicators, fully validating the effectiveness and practical value of our
approach in real-world search scenarios.

TL;DR: 本文研究了生成式推荐模型中的token布局设计，提出了基于三个设计原则的Lagged Action Conditioning方法，在保持准确性的同时显著降低了计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成式推荐模型将用户交互历史视为序列进行自回归预测，当同时建模物品和动作时，token布局（物品/动作token的顺序和可见性）对模型性能有重要影响。

Method: 提出了基于三个设计原则的统一研究框架：最大化物品/动作信号、保持"给定物品的动作"条件关系、避免信息泄露。设计了非交错布局方法Lagged Action Conditioning。

Result: 在公共数据集和大规模生产日志上的实验表明，LAC方法在显著降低FLOPs的同时，达到了与交错布局相当或更优的准确性。

Conclusion: 提出的非交错方法LAC为构建准确且高效的生成式推荐系统提供了可行的指导方案。

Abstract: Generative Recommendation (GR) models treat a user's interaction history as a
sequence to be autoregressively predicted. When both items and actions (e.g.,
watch time, purchase, comment) are modeled, the layout-the ordering and
visibility of item/action tokens-critically determines what information the
model can use and how it generalizes. We present a unified study of token
layouts for GR grounded in first principles: (P1) maximize item/action signal
in both input/output space, (P2) preserve the conditioning relationship "action
given item" and (P3) no information leakage.
  While interleaved layout (where item and action occupy separate tokens)
naturally satisfies these principles, it also bloats sequence length with
larger training/inference cost. On the non-interleaved front, we design a novel
and effective approach, Lagged Action Conditioning (LAC), which appears strange
on the surface but aligns well with the design principles to yield strong
accuracy. Comprehensive experiments on public datasets and large-scale
production logs evaluate different layout options and empirically verifies the
design principles. Our proposed non-interleaved method, LAC, achieves
competitive or superior quality at substantially lower FLOPs than interleaving.
Our findings offer actionable guidance for assembling GR systems that are both
accurate and efficient.

TL;DR: 提出了一种上下文感知的推理增强生成搜索框架，通过统一异构上下文信息、自演化的后训练范式以及改进的强化学习算法，提升了电商搜索推荐性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 用户复杂的搜索上下文（时空因素、历史交互、当前查询信息）在电商搜索推荐中至关重要，但现有方法在整合这些上下文信息方面存在局限，无法充分捕捉用户意图。

Method: 将异构用户和物品上下文统一为文本表示，采用自演化的后训练范式（结合监督微调和强化学习）增强模型推理能力，并提出改进的GRPO算法来减少搜索场景中的偏差。

Result: 在真实电商平台的搜索日志数据上进行广泛实验，证明该方法相比强基线模型取得了更优越的性能。

Conclusion: 该上下文感知推理增强生成搜索框架能够有效理解复杂上下文，提升搜索推荐的效果。

Abstract: Search-based recommendation is one of the most critical application scenarios
in e-commerce platforms. Users' complex search contexts--such as spatiotemporal
factors, historical interactions, and current query's information--constitute
an essential part of their decision-making, reflecting implicit preferences
that complement explicit query terms. Modeling such rich contextual signals and
their intricate associations with candidate items remains a key challenge.
Although numerous efforts have been devoted to building more effective search
methods, existing approaches still show limitations in integrating contextual
information, which hinders their ability to fully capture user intent.
  To address these challenges, we propose a context-aware reasoning-enhanced
generative search framework for better \textbf{understanding the complicated
context}. Specifically, the framework first unifies heterogeneous user and item
contexts into textual representations or text-based semantic identifiers and
aligns them. To overcome the lack of explicit reasoning trajectories, we
introduce a self-evolving post-training paradigm that iteratively combines
supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning to progressively enhance the
model's reasoning capability. In addition, we identify potential biases in
existing RL algorithms when applied to search scenarios and present a debiased
variant of GRPO to improve ranking performance. Extensive experiments on search
log data collected from a real-world e-commerce platform demonstrate that our
approach achieves superior performance compared with strong baselines,
validating its effectiveness for search-based recommendation.

Result: 建立了可解释数据集搜索的评估基准，提供了数据集和字段级别的标注。

Conclusion: DSEBench为可解释数据集搜索研究提供了高质量测试集和基线方法。

Abstract: Dataset search has been an established information retrieval task. Current
paradigms either retrieve datasets that are relevant to a keyword query or find
datasets that are similar to an input target dataset. To allow for their
combined specification of information needs, in this article, we investigate
the more generalized task of Dataset Search with Examples (DSE) and further
extend it to Explainable DSE that requires identifying the metadata and content
fields of a dataset that indicate its relevance to the query and similarity to
the target datasets. To facilitate this research, we construct DSEBench, a test
collection that provides high-quality dataset- and field-level annotations to
enable the evaluation of explainable DSE. We also employ a large language model
to generate numerous annotations to be used for training. We establish
extensive baselines on DSEBench by adapting and evaluating a variety of sparse,
dense, and LLM-based retrieval, reranking, and explanation methods.

TL;DR: TA-Rec是一个两阶段扩散模型框架，通过预训练中的时间一致性正则化实现一步生成，并通过微调中的自适应偏好对齐来提升推荐效果，解决了扩散模型在序列推荐中计算效率与推荐效果之间的权衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在序列推荐中需要多步去噪过程，这依赖于离散近似并引入离散化误差，导致计算效率与推荐效果之间存在权衡。

Method: 提出两阶段框架：1）预训练阶段使用时间一致性正则化平滑去噪函数，实现一步生成；2）微调阶段引入自适应偏好对齐，基于偏好对相似性和时间步长自适应对齐去噪过程与用户偏好。

Result: 大量实验证明TA-Rec的两阶段目标有效缓解了离散化误差引起的权衡问题，同时提升了基于扩散的推荐器的效率和效果。

Conclusion: TA-Rec通过两阶段框架成功解决了扩散模型在序列推荐中的效率-效果权衡问题，实现了高效且有效的推荐生成。

Abstract: Diffusion models have emerged as a powerful paradigm for generative
sequential recommendation, which typically generate next items to recommend
guided by user interaction histories with a multi-step denoising process.
However, the multi-step process relies on discrete approximations, introducing
discretization error that creates a trade-off between computational efficiency
and recommendation effectiveness. To address this trade-off, we propose TA-Rec,
a two-stage framework that achieves one-step generation by smoothing the
denoising function during pretraining while alleviating trajectory deviation by
aligning with user preferences during fine-tuning. Specifically, to improve the
efficiency without sacrificing the recommendation performance, TA-Rec pretrains
the denoising model with Temporal Consistency Regularization (TCR), enforcing
the consistency between the denoising results across adjacent steps. Thus, we
can smooth the denoising function to map the noise as oracle items in one step
with bounded error. To further enhance effectiveness, TA-Rec introduces
Adaptive Preference Alignment (APA) that aligns the denoising process with user
preference adaptively based on preference pair similarity and timesteps.
Extensive experiments prove that TA-Rec's two-stage objective effectively
mitigates the discretization errors-induced trade-off, enhancing both
efficiency and effectiveness of diffusion-based recommenders.

TL;DR: 本文系统研究了角色扮演提示对LLM零样本排序性能的影响，发现角色描述对排序质量有显著影响，并通过因果干预技术揭示了角色信息在模型中的编码机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM作为零样本排序器性能对提示高度敏感，角色扮演提示能提供更稳健的相关性排序，但其机制和多样性尚未充分探索，限制了有效使用和可解释性。

Method: 使用机制可解释性的因果干预技术，追踪角色扮演信息如何在LLM中塑造相关性判断，分析角色描述对排序质量的影响。

Result: 发现角色描述对LLM排序质量有显著影响；角色扮演信号主要编码在早期层，在中间层与任务指令交互，但与查询或文档表征交互有限；识别出一组对角色条件相关性至关重要的注意力头。

Conclusion: 研究揭示了角色扮演在LLM排序中的内部工作机制，为IR及其他领域设计更有效提示提供了指导，指出了在零样本应用中利用角色扮演的更广泛机会。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as promising zero-shot rankers, but
their performance is highly sensitive to prompt formulation. In particular,
role-play prompts, where the model is assigned a functional role or identity,
often give more robust and accurate relevance rankings. However, the mechanisms
and diversity of role-play effects remain underexplored, limiting both
effective use and interpretability. In this work, we systematically examine how
role-play variations influence zero-shot LLM rankers. We employ causal
intervention techniques from mechanistic interpretability to trace how
role-play information shapes relevance judgments in LLMs. Our analysis reveals
that (1) careful formulation of role descriptions have a large effect on the
ranking quality of the LLM; (2) role-play signals are predominantly encoded in
early layers and communicate with task instructions in middle layers, while
receiving limited interaction with query or document representations.
Specifically, we identify a group of attention heads that encode information
critical for role-conditioned relevance. These findings not only shed light on
the inner workings of role-play in LLM ranking but also offer guidance for
designing more effective prompts in IR and beyond, pointing toward broader
opportunities for leveraging role-play in zero-shot applications.

TL;DR: Lean Finder是一个专为数学家和Lean用户设计的语义搜索引擎，通过理解用户意图和数学语义，显著提升了定理搜索效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的Lean搜索引擎主要依赖形式化语句的非正式翻译，忽视了真实用户查询与系统理解之间的不匹配问题，导致数学家在定理证明过程中难以找到相关定理，学习曲线陡峭，进展缓慢。

Method: 首先分析并聚类公开Lean讨论的语义，然后在模拟用户意图的合成查询上微调文本嵌入，通过多样化反馈信号使系统与数学家的偏好对齐，从多个角度编码其目标意识。

Result: 在真实查询、非正式化语句和证明状态上的评估显示，Lean Finder相比之前的搜索引擎和GPT-4o实现了超过30%的相对改进。

Conclusion: Lean Finder不仅显著提升了定理搜索性能，还能与基于LLM的定理证明器兼容，连接了检索与形式推理。

Abstract: We present Lean Finder, a semantic search engine for Lean and mathlib that
understands and aligns with the intents of mathematicians. Progress in formal
theorem proving is often hindered by the difficulty of locating relevant
theorems and the steep learning curve of the Lean 4 language, making
advancement slow and labor-intensive. Existing Lean search engines, though
helpful, rely primarily on informalizations (natural language translation of
the formal statements), while largely overlooking the mismatch with real-world
user queries. In contrast, we propose a user-centered semantic search tailored
to the needs of mathematicians. Our approach begins by analyzing and clustering
the semantics of public Lean discussions, then fine-tuning text embeddings on
synthesized queries that emulate user intents. We further align Lean Finder
with mathematicians' preferences using diverse feedback signals, encoding it
with a rich awareness of their goals from multiple perspectives. Evaluations on
real-world queries, informalized statements, and proof states demonstrate that
our Lean Finder achieves over $30\%$ relative improvement compared to previous
search engines and GPT-4o. In addition, Lean Finder is compatible with
LLM-based theorem provers, bridging retrieval with formal reasoning. Lean
Finder is available at: https://leanfinder.github.io

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态学习系统在非平稳环境中面临概念漂移的挑战，特别是模态特定的漂移和缺乏持续稳定适应机制的问题，导致性能下降。

Method: 提出LS-OGD自适应控制框架，使用在线控制器动态调整模型学习率和不同数据模态的融合权重，响应检测到的漂移和预测误差变化。

Result: 理论证明在有限漂移条件下，LS-OGD系统的预测误差具有一致最终有界性，并在漂移停止时收敛到零；自适应融合策略能有效隔离和缓解严重模态特定漂移的影响。

Conclusion: LS-OGD为开发可靠且持续自适应的多模态学习系统提供了理论基础，确保系统在面对概念漂移时的韧性和容错能力。

Abstract: Multimodal learning systems often struggle in non-stationary environments due
to concept drift, where changing data distributions can degrade performance.
Modality-specific drifts and the lack of mechanisms for continuous, stable
adaptation compound this challenge. This paper introduces LS-OGD, a novel
adaptive control framework for robust multimodal learning in the presence of
concept drift. LS-OGD uses an online controller that dynamically adjusts the
model's learning rate and the fusion weights between different data modalities
in response to detected drift and evolving prediction errors. We prove that
under bounded drift conditions, the LS-OGD system's prediction error is
uniformly ultimately bounded and converges to zero if the drift ceases.
Additionally, we demonstrate that the adaptive fusion strategy effectively
isolates and mitigates the impact of severe modality-specific drift, thereby
ensuring system resilience and fault tolerance. These theoretical guarantees
establish a principled foundation for developing reliable and continuously
adapting multimodal learning systems.

Motivation: 多响应采样是提高LLM输出质量的常用方法，但会带来额外的计算成本。关键挑战是如何平衡准确率提升与效率，决定何时停止生成新样本。

Method: 基于序列搜索与贝叶斯学习，BEACON顺序生成策略LLM的响应，实时更新奖励分布的后验信念，通过权衡预期收益与计算成本来决定停止时机。

Result: BEACON在实证中平均采样次数减少高达80%，同时保持响应质量。还展示了在成本效益偏好数据生成中的实用性。

Conclusion: BEACON提供了理论最优性保证和实际可行性，为未来研究者提供了可行的扩展方向和实践见解。

Abstract: Sampling multiple responses is a common way to improve LLM output quality,
but it comes at the cost of additional computation. The key challenge is
deciding when to stop generating new samples to balance accuracy gains against
efficiency. To address this, we introduce BEACON (Bayesian Efficient Adaptive
Criterion for Optimal N-stopping), a principled adaptive sampling framework
grounded in Sequential Search with Bayesian Learning. BEACON sequentially
generates responses from the policy LLM, updates posterior belief over reward
distributions in real time without further training, and determines when to
stop by weighing expected gains against computational cost. Sampling terminates
once the marginal utility of further exploration no longer justifies the
expense. We establish both theoretical optimality guarantees and practical
tractability, and show empirically that BEACON reduces average sampling by up
to 80% while maintaining response quality. We further demonstrate BEACON's
utility for cost-efficient preference data generation and outline practical
extensions, offering actionable insights for future researchers.

TL;DR: PatMD是一种新颖的有害表情包检测方法，通过学习并主动减轻潜在误判风险来改进检测效果，超越现有MLLM方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有检测方法（包括MLLM技术）难以处理表情包中通过讽刺和隐喻等修辞手法表达的隐含有害内容，导致频繁误判。

Method: 构建知识库将表情包解构为误判风险模式，识别可能被误判的原因（漏判有害内容或误判良性内容），然后检索相关模式动态指导MLLM推理。

Result: 在5个有害检测任务的6,626个表情包基准测试中，PatMD优于最先进基线方法，F1分数平均提升8.30%，准确率提升7.71%。

Conclusion: PatMD通过主动识别和避免已知误判陷阱，显著提高了有害表情包的检测能力，并展现出强大的泛化性。

Abstract: Internet memes have emerged as a popular multimodal medium, yet they are
increasingly weaponized to convey harmful opinions through subtle rhetorical
devices like irony and metaphor. Existing detection approaches, including
MLLM-based techniques, struggle with these implicit expressions, leading to
frequent misjudgments. This paper introduces PatMD, a novel approach that
improves harmful meme detection by learning from and proactively mitigating
these potential misjudgment risks. Our core idea is to move beyond superficial
content-level matching and instead identify the underlying misjudgment risk
patterns, proactively guiding the MLLMs to avoid known misjudgment pitfalls. We
first construct a knowledge base where each meme is deconstructed into a
misjudgment risk pattern explaining why it might be misjudged, either
overlooking harmful undertones (false negative) or overinterpreting benign
content (false positive). For a given target meme, PatMD retrieves relevant
patterns and utilizes them to dynamically guide the MLLM's reasoning.
Experiments on a benchmark of 6,626 memes across 5 harmful detection tasks show
that PatMD outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving an average of
8.30\% improvement in F1-score and 7.71\% improvement in accuracy,
demonstrating strong generalizability and improved detection capability of
harmful memes.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统依赖专家视觉检查的EEG信号分类方法在处理日益复杂和大量的EEG记录时变得不切实际，需要自动化解决方案。

Method: 使用WaveNet架构，利用扩张因果卷积和残差连接处理EEG数据，在Mayo Clinic和St. Anne's大学医院的公开标注数据集上进行训练验证测试（70/20/10分割）。

Result: 模型分类准确率超过之前的CNN和LSTM方法，能高精度区分噪声和伪影，但在生理和病理信号间存在可解释的误分类，反映了临床固有的重叠性。

Conclusion: WaveNet架构因其能捕捉细粒度和长程时间依赖关系而适用于EEG数据分类，研究还详细说明了支持模型泛化的预处理流程。

Abstract: This study introduces a WaveNet-based deep learning model designed to
automate the classification of EEG signals into physiological, pathological,
artifact, and noise categories. Traditional methods for EEG signal
classification, which rely on expert visual review, are becoming increasingly
impractical due to the growing complexity and volume of EEG recordings.
Leveraging a publicly available annotated dataset from Mayo Clinic and St.
Anne's University Hospital, the WaveNet model was trained, validated, and
tested on 209,232 samples with a 70/20/10 percent split. The model achieved a
classification accuracy exceeding previous CNN and LSTM-based approaches, and
was benchmarked against a Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) baseline.
Notably, the model distinguishes noise and artifacts with high precision,
although it reveals a modest but explainable degree of misclassification
between physiological and pathological signals, reflecting inherent clinical
overlap. WaveNet's architecture, originally developed for raw audio synthesis,
is well suited for EEG data due to its use of dilated causal convolutions and
residual connections, enabling it to capture both fine-grained and long-range
temporal dependencies. The research also details the preprocessing pipeline,
including dynamic dataset partitioning and normalization steps that support
model generalization.

Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD) presents a growing global challenge, affecting over
10 million individuals, with prevalence expected to double by 2040. Early
diagnosis remains difficult due to the late emergence of motor symptoms and
limitations of traditional clinical assessments. In this study, we propose a
novel pipeline that leverages keystroke dynamics as a non-invasive and scalable
biomarker for remote PD screening and telemonitoring. Our methodology involves
three main stages: (i) preprocessing of data from four distinct datasets,
extracting four temporal signals and addressing class imbalance through the
comparison of three methods; (ii) pre-training eight state-of-the-art
deep-learning architectures on the two largest datasets, optimizing temporal
windowing, stride, and other hyperparameters; (iii) fine-tuning on an
intermediate-sized dataset and performing external validation on a fourth,
independent cohort. Our results demonstrate that hybrid convolutional-recurrent
and transformer-based models achieve strong external validation performance,
with AUC-ROC scores exceeding 90% and F1-Score over 70%. Notably, a temporal
convolutional model attains an AUC-ROC of 91.14% in external validation,
outperforming existing methods that rely solely on internal validation. These
findings underscore the potential of keystroke dynamics as a reliable digital
biomarker for PD, offering a promising avenue for early detection and
continuous monitoring.

Abstract: As wildfires become increasingly destructive and expensive to control,
effective management of active wildfires requires accurate, real-time fire
spread predictions. To enhance the forecasting accuracy of active fires, data
assimilation plays a vital role by integrating observations (such as
remote-sensing data) and fire predictions generated from numerical models. This
paper provides a comprehensive investigation on the application of a recently
proposed diffusion-model-based filtering algorithm -- the Ensemble Score Filter
(EnSF) -- to the data assimilation problem for real-time active wildfire spread
predictions. Leveraging a score-based generative diffusion model, EnSF has been
shown to have superior accuracy for high-dimensional nonlinear filtering
problems, making it an ideal candidate for the filtering problems of wildfire
spread models. Technical details are provided, and our numerical investigations
demonstrate that EnSF provides superior accuracy, stability, and computational
efficiency, establishing it as a robust and practical method for wildfire data
assimilation. Our code has been made publicly available.

Method: 创建了工具响应处理数据集，评估了15个开源和闭源模型，采用多种提示策略进行测试。

Result: JSON处理对前沿模型来说仍是困难任务，最优处理策略取决于工具输出的性质和大小以及所需推理的复杂性。

Conclusion: 工具响应处理能力是LLMs实际应用中的关键瓶颈，需要针对不同场景选择合适处理策略。

Abstract: Most realistic task automation problems require large language models (LLMs)
to call tools, which often return complex JSON responses. These responses must
be further processed to derive the information necessary for task completion.
The ability of LLMs to do so is under-studied. In this paper, we study the tool
response processing task and LLMs' abilities to process structured (JSON)
responses. We created a dataset for this task, and evaluated 15 open and closed
weight models using multiple prompting approaches. Our results show that JSON
processing remains a difficult task even for frontier models across multiple
prompting strategies. The optimal response processing strategy depends on both
the nature and size of the tool outputs, as well as the complexity of the
required reasoning. Variations in processing approaches can lead to performance
differences ranging from 3\% to 50\%.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 推动可持续能源和废物管理策略，探索未充分利用生物质资源（如废弃咖啡渣和枣核）的可持续制氢潜力，并利用人工智能提高过程建模精度和优化效率。

Method: 对纯枣核、废弃咖啡渣及其混合物进行工业分析、元素分析、纤维分析、热重分析、动力学分析、热力学分析和热解-微气相色谱分析；使用等转化率方法（KAS、FWO、Friedman）进行动力学建模；训练LSTM模型预测热重曲线。

Conclusion: 人工智能集成显著提高了热解过程建模的准确性，未充分利用生物质资源具有可持续制氢潜力，不同混合物在氢气产率和活化能方面表现出不同特性。

Abstract: This work contributes to advancing sustainable energy and waste management
strategies by investigating the thermochemical conversion of food-based biomass
through pyrolysis, highlighting the role of artificial intelligence (AI) in
enhancing process modelling accuracy and optimization efficiency. The main
objective is to explore the potential of underutilized biomass resources, such
as spent coffee grounds (SCG) and date seeds (DS), for sustainable hydrogen
production. Specifically, it aims to optimize the pyrolysis process while
evaluating the performance of these resources both individually and as blends.
Proximate, ultimate, fibre, TGA/DTG, kinetic, thermodynamic, and Py-Micro GC
analyses were conducted for pure DS, SCG, and blends (75% DS - 25% SCG, 50% DS
- 50% SCG, 25% DS - 75% SCG). Blend 3 offered superior hydrogen yield potential
but had the highest activation energy (Ea: 313.24 kJ/mol), while Blend 1
exhibited the best activation energy value (Ea: 161.75 kJ/mol). The kinetic
modelling based on isoconversional methods (KAS, FWO, Friedman) identified KAS
as the most accurate. These approaches provide a detailed understanding of the
pyrolysis process, with particular emphasis on the integration of artificial
intelligence. An LSTM model trained with lignocellulosic data predicted TGA
curves with exceptional accuracy (R^2: 0.9996-0.9998).

TL;DR: 提出LAMI框架，通过联合图-语言建模检测青少年非法药物使用并解释行为风险因素，在YRBS和NSDUH数据集上表现优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有建模方法将调查变量独立处理，忽略了变量间的潜在关联结构，需要开发能捕捉变量间潜在关系并提供可解释性的方法。

Method: LAMI框架将个体响应表示为关系图，通过专门的图结构学习层学习潜在连接，并集成大语言模型生成基于图结构和调查语义的自然语言解释。

Result: 在YRBS和NSDUH数据集上的实验表明，LAMI在预测准确性上优于竞争基线方法。可解释性分析显示LAMI能揭示有意义的行为子结构和心理社会路径。

Conclusion: LAMI框架能有效检测青少年非法药物使用，同时提供对家庭动态、同伴影响和学校相关压力等已知风险因素的可解释洞察。

Abstract: Illicit drug use among teenagers and young adults (TYAs) remains a pressing
public health concern, with rising prevalence and long-term impacts on health
and well-being. To detect illicit drug use among TYAs, researchers analyze
large-scale surveys such as the Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) and the
National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH), which preserve rich
demographic, psychological, and environmental factors related to substance use.
However, existing modeling methods treat survey variables independently,
overlooking latent and interconnected structures among them. To address this
limitation, we propose LAMI (LAtent relation Mining with bi-modal
Interpretability), a novel joint graph-language modeling framework for
detecting illicit drug use and interpreting behavioral risk factors among TYAs.
LAMI represents individual responses as relational graphs, learns latent
connections through a specialized graph structure learning layer, and
integrates a large language model to generate natural language explanations
grounded in both graph structures and survey semantics. Experiments on the YRBS
and NSDUH datasets show that LAMI outperforms competitive baselines in
predictive accuracy. Interpretability analyses further demonstrate that LAMI
reveals meaningful behavioral substructures and psychosocial pathways, such as
family dynamics, peer influence, and school-related distress, that align with
established risk factors for substance use.

TL;DR: CTR-LoRA是一种基于曲率信任区域的参数高效微调框架，通过秩调度和稳定性感知优化，在多个7B-13B模型上实现了优于现有PEFT方法的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有PEFT方法在低秩更新、量化或启发式预算分配方面提高了效率，但通常将容量分配与训练过程中更新演化分离开来。

Method: CTR-LoRA基于轻量级二阶代理的边际效用分配参数，并使用Fisher/Hessian度量信任区域来约束更新，结合秩调度和稳定性感知优化。

Result: 在多个开源骨干网络(7B-13B)上，无论是分布内还是分布外基准测试，都显示出对强PEFT基线的持续改进，提高了准确性、训练稳定性，减少了内存需求并实现了更高吞吐量。

Conclusion: CTR-LoRA在性能和效率的帕累托前沿上表现出色，为更稳健和可部署的PEFT提供了一条原则性路径。

Abstract: Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) has become the standard approach for
adapting large language models under limited compute and memory budgets.
Although previous methods improve efficiency through low-rank updates,
quantization, or heuristic budget reallocation, they often decouple the
allocation of capacity from the way updates evolve during training. In this
work, we introduce CTR-LoRA, a framework guided by curvature trust region that
integrates rank scheduling with stability-aware optimization. CTR-LoRA
allocates parameters based on marginal utility derived from lightweight
second-order proxies and constrains updates using a Fisher/Hessian-metric trust
region. Experiments on multiple open-source backbones (7B-13B), evaluated on
both in-distribution and out-of-distribution benchmarks, show consistent
improvements over strong PEFT baselines. In addition to increased accuracy,
CTR-LoRA enhances training stability, reduces memory requirements, and achieves
higher throughput, positioning it on the Pareto frontier of performance and
efficiency. These results highlight a principled path toward more robust and
deployable PEFT.

TL;DR: Long Exposure系统通过解决微调中的Shadowy Sparsity问题，加速参数高效微调(PEFT)，实现最高2.49倍的端到端微调加速。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 参数高效微调(PEFT)技术在时间投入和运营成本方面存在效率低下的问题，特别是在微调过程中出现的Shadowy Sparsity尚未得到充分解决。

Method: Long Exposure系统包含三个关键组件：Shadowy-sparsity Exposer使用长感知范围捕获更多稀疏细节；Sequence-oriented Predictor处理大序列输入和不断变化的参数；Dynamic-aware Operator解决动态稀疏操作问题。

Result: 广泛评估显示，Long Exposure在端到端微调中实现了最高2.49倍的加速，优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: Long Exposure为加速LLMs的PEFT提供了有前景的进展，有效解决了微调中的效率挑战。

Abstract: The adaptation of pre-trained large language models (LLMs) to diverse
downstream tasks via fine-tuning is critical for numerous applications.
However, the inefficiency of parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques
presents significant challenges in terms of time investments and operational
costs. In this paper, we first introduce a nuanced form of sparsity, termed
Shadowy Sparsity, which is distinctive in fine-tuning and has not been
adequately addressed for acceleration. Under Shadowy Sparsity, we propose Long
Exposure, an efficient system to accelerate PEFT for LLMs. Long Exposure
comprises three key components: Shadowy-sparsity Exposer employs a prolonged
sensing range to capture more sparsity details under shadowy sparsity;
Sequence-oriented Predictor provides efficient yet accurate predictions to
handle large sequence inputs and constantly-evolving parameters; and
Dynamic-aware Operator facilitates more structured computational patterns and
coalesced memory accesses, addressing dynamic sparse operations. Extensive
evaluations show that Long Exposure outperforms state-of-the-arts with up to a
$2.49\times$ speedup in end-to-end fine-tuning, offering promising advancements
in accelerating PEFT for LLMs.

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的推荐系统学习框架BPL，通过双重蒸馏策略在事实和反事实测试环境中都实现高性能，解决了传统去偏方法在两个测试环境间性能权衡的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 推荐系统存在偏差问题，导致收集的反馈无法完全揭示用户偏好。传统去偏方法主要关注反事实测试环境，但在基于实际用户-物品交互的事实测试环境中准确率显著下降。需要一种在两个测试环境中都能表现良好的模型。

Method: BPL框架采用双重蒸馏策略：1) 从有偏模型进行师生蒸馏，保留与收集反馈一致的知识；2) 通过可靠性过滤的自蒸馏，在训练过程中迭代精炼知识。

Result: 综合实验验证了BPL在事实和反事实测试中的有效性。

Conclusion: BPL框架能够逐步揭示用户偏好，在事实和反事实测试环境中都实现高性能，解决了传统去偏方法的局限性。

Abstract: Recommender systems suffer from biases that cause the collected feedback to
incompletely reveal user preference. While debiasing learning has been
extensively studied, they mostly focused on the specialized (called
counterfactual) test environment simulated by random exposure of items,
significantly degrading accuracy in the typical (called factual) test
environment based on actual user-item interactions. In fact, each test
environment highlights the benefit of a different aspect: the counterfactual
test emphasizes user satisfaction in the long-terms, while the factual test
focuses on predicting subsequent user behaviors on platforms. Therefore, it is
desirable to have a model that performs well on both tests rather than only
one. In this work, we introduce a new learning framework, called Bias-adaptive
Preference distillation Learning (BPL), to gradually uncover user preferences
with dual distillation strategies. These distillation strategies are designed
to drive high performance in both factual and counterfactual test environments.
Employing a specialized form of teacher-student distillation from a biased
model, BPL retains accurate preference knowledge aligned with the collected
feedback, leading to high performance in the factual test. Furthermore, through
self-distillation with reliability filtering, BPL iteratively refines its
knowledge throughout the training process. This enables the model to produce
more accurate predictions across a broader range of user-item combinations,
thereby improving performance in the counterfactual test. Comprehensive
experiments validate the effectiveness of BPL in both factual and
counterfactual tests. Our implementation is accessible via:

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代大型推理模型通过思维链推理展示出强大的多步问题解决能力，但这种迭代思维机制引入了新的安全漏洞。

Method: 采用对抗嵌入训练和反向门植入策略，通过优化嵌入鼓励模型在推理步骤后生成过渡性标记，从而诱导推理循环。

Result: 在四个先进LRM和三个数学推理基准测试中达到100%攻击成功率，迫使模型生成至最大标记限制。

Conclusion: 该研究揭示了大型推理模型在推理效率方面的关键安全漏洞，攻击具有隐蔽性且对现有缓解策略具有鲁棒性。

Abstract: Modern large reasoning models (LRMs) exhibit impressive multi-step
problem-solving via chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning. However, this iterative
thinking mechanism introduces a new vulnerability surface. We present the
Deadlock Attack, a resource exhaustion method that hijacks an LRM's generative
control flow by training a malicious adversarial embedding to induce perpetual
reasoning loops. Specifically, the optimized embedding encourages transitional
tokens (e.g., "Wait", "But") after reasoning steps, preventing the model from
concluding its answer. A key challenge we identify is the
continuous-to-discrete projection gap: na\"ive projections of adversarial
embeddings to token sequences nullify the attack. To overcome this, we
introduce a backdoor implantation strategy, enabling reliable activation
through specific trigger tokens. Our method achieves a 100% attack success rate
across four advanced LRMs (Phi-RM, Nemotron-Nano, R1-Qwen, R1-Llama) and three
math reasoning benchmarks, forcing models to generate up to their maximum token
limits. The attack is also stealthy (in terms of causing negligible utility
loss on benign user inputs) and remains robust against existing strategies
trying to mitigate the overthinking issue. Our findings expose a critical and
underexplored security vulnerability in LRMs from the perspective of reasoning
(in)efficiency.

Motivation: 现实联邦学习场景中，新客户端不断加入并带来新知识，现有方法在知识发现粒度、源域性能保持和适应效率方面存在不足。

Method: 将模型分为编码器和分类器，利用编码器对域偏移敏感、分类器对类增量敏感的特性，开发细粒度知识发现、贡献驱动聚合和抗遗忘机制。

Result: 在三个典型数据偏移场景的多域数据集实验中，Gains在源域和目标域客户端性能上均显著优于其他基线方法。

Conclusion: Gains方法能有效解决开放集联邦学习中的知识发现和适应问题，实现源域和目标域性能的平衡提升。

Abstract: Conventional federated learning (FL) assumes a closed world with a fixed
total number of clients. In contrast, new clients continuously join the FL
process in real-world scenarios, introducing new knowledge. This raises two
critical demands: detecting new knowledge, i.e., knowledge discovery, and
integrating it into the global model, i.e., knowledge adaptation. Existing
research focuses on coarse-grained knowledge discovery, and often sacrifices
source domain performance and adaptation efficiency. To this end, we propose a
fine-grained federated domain adaptation approach in open set (Gains). Gains
splits the model into an encoder and a classifier, empirically revealing
features extracted by the encoder are sensitive to domain shifts while
classifier parameters are sensitive to class increments. Based on this, we
develop fine-grained knowledge discovery and contribution-driven aggregation
techniques to identify and incorporate new knowledge. Additionally, an
anti-forgetting mechanism is designed to preserve source domain performance,
ensuring balanced adaptation. Experimental results on multi-domain datasets
across three typical data-shift scenarios demonstrate that Gains significantly
outperforms other baselines in performance for both source-domain and
target-domain clients. Code is available at:

Motivation: 零样本预测需要在没有直接历史数据的情况下预测未见条件的结果，这对传统预测方法构成重大挑战。

Method: 将信号分解为不同频率分量，采用分辨率感知检索机制：低频分量依赖更广泛的空间上下文，高频分量关注局部影响，从而动态检索相关数据并适应新位置。

Result: 在ERA5数据集上，模型显著优于传统预测方法、数值天气预报模型和现代基础时间序列模型，比HRRR的MSE降低71%，比Chronos的MSE降低34%。

Conclusion: 检索增强和分辨率感知策略在零样本预测中非常有效，为微气候建模及其他领域提供了可扩展且数据高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Zero-shot forecasting aims to predict outcomes for previously unseen
conditions without direct historical data, posing a significant challenge for
traditional forecasting methods. We introduce a Resolution-Aware
Retrieval-Augmented Forecasting model that enhances predictive accuracy by
leveraging spatial correlations and temporal frequency characteristics. By
decomposing signals into different frequency components, our model employs
resolution-aware retrieval, where lower-frequency components rely on broader
spatial context, while higher-frequency components focus on local influences.
This allows the model to dynamically retrieve relevant data and adapt to new
locations with minimal historical context.
  Applied to microclimate forecasting, our model significantly outperforms
traditional forecasting methods, numerical weather prediction models, and
modern foundation time series models, achieving 71% lower MSE than HRRR and 34%
lower MSE than Chronos on the ERA5 dataset.
  Our results highlight the effectiveness of retrieval-augmented and
resolution-aware strategies, offering a scalable and data-efficient solution
for zero-shot forecasting in microclimate modeling and beyond.

Method: 结合自注意力机制和U-Net与FNO，捕捉长程依赖关系并有效建模局部高频特征，采用迁移学习微调低保真数据以减少高保真数据需求。

Result: SAU-FNO在热预测精度上达到SOTA水平，相比传统FEM方法实现842倍加速。

Conclusion: SAU-FNO是先进3D IC热仿真的高效工具，平衡了精度和速度。

Abstract: Thermal management in 3D ICs is increasingly challenging due to higher power
densities. Traditional PDE-solving-based methods, while accurate, are too slow
for iterative design. Machine learning approaches like FNO provide faster
alternatives but suffer from high-frequency information loss and high-fidelity
data dependency. We introduce Self-Attention U-Net Fourier Neural Operator
(SAU-FNO), a novel framework combining self-attention and U-Net with FNO to
capture long-range dependencies and model local high-frequency features
effectively. Transfer learning is employed to fine-tune low-fidelity data,
minimizing the need for extensive high-fidelity datasets and speeding up
training. Experiments demonstrate that SAU-FNO achieves state-of-the-art
thermal prediction accuracy and provides an 842x speedup over traditional FEM
methods, making it an efficient tool for advanced 3D IC thermal simulations.

Result: 实验表明当前最先进基线的有效性和效率远未达到满意水平。

Conclusion: 该基准测试可为未来LLM记忆和优化算法的研究铺平道路。

Abstract: Scaling up data, parameters, and test-time computation has been the
mainstream methods to improve LLM systems (LLMsys), but their upper bounds are
almost reached due to the gradual depletion of high-quality data and marginal
gains obtained from larger computational resource consumption. Inspired by the
abilities of human and traditional AI systems in learning from practice,
constructing memory and continual learning frameworks for LLMsys has become an
important and popular research direction in recent literature. Yet, existing
benchmarks for LLM memory often focus on evaluating the system on homogeneous
reading comprehension tasks with long-form inputs rather than testing their
abilities to learn from accumulated user feedback in service time. Therefore,
we propose a user feedback simulation framework and a comprehensive benchmark
covering multiple domains, languages, and types of tasks to evaluate the
continual learning abilities of LLMsys. Experiments show that the effectiveness
and efficiency of state-of-the-art baselines are far from satisfying, and we
hope this benchmark could pave the way for future studies on LLM memory and
optimization algorithms.

Conclusion: 该方法为非线性优化问题实现完全对话式建模管道开辟了道路。

Abstract: Reformulating nonlinear optimization problems is largely manual and
expertise-intensive, yet it remains essential for solving such problems with
linear optimization solvers or applying special-purpose algorithms. We
introduce \textit{LinearizeLLM}, an agent-based framework that solves this task
by leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs). The framework assigns each
nonlinear pattern to a \textit{reformulation agent} that is explicitly
instructed to derive an exact linear reformulation for its nonlinearity
pattern, for instance, absolute-value terms or bilinear products of decision
variables. The agents then coordinate to assemble a solver-ready linear model
equivalent to the original problem. To benchmark the approach, we create a
dataset of 20 real-world nonlinear optimization problems derived from the
established ComplexOR dataset of linear optimization problems. We evaluate our
approach with several LLMs. Our results indicate that specialized LLM agents
can automate linearization tasks, opening a path toward fully conversational
modeling pipelines for nonlinear optimization.

Abstract: High-quality training data is the foundation of machine learning and
artificial intelligence, shaping how models learn and perform. Although much is
known about what types of data are effective for training, the impact of the
data's geometric structure on model performance remains largely underexplored.
We propose that both the richness of representation and the elimination of
redundancy within training data critically influence learning outcomes. To
investigate this, we employ persistent homology to extract topological features
from data within a metric space, thereby offering a principled way to quantify
diversity beyond entropy-based measures. Our findings highlight persistent
homology as a powerful tool for analyzing and enhancing the training data that
drives AI systems.

Conclusion: 建立了一个实用且资源高效的框架，使基础模型能够快速适应特定用户需求，大幅降低遥感图像标注成本。

Abstract: Open-vocabulary object detection (OVD) models offer remarkable flexibility by
detecting objects from arbitrary text queries. However, their zero-shot
performance in specialized domains like Remote Sensing (RS) is often
compromised by the inherent ambiguity of natural language, limiting critical
downstream applications. For instance, an OVD model may struggle to distinguish
between fine-grained classes such as "fishing boat" and "yacht" since their
embeddings are similar and often inseparable. This can hamper specific user
goals, such as monitoring illegal fishing, by producing irrelevant detections.
To address this, we propose a cascaded approach that couples the broad
generalization of a large pre-trained OVD model with a lightweight few-shot
classifier. Our method first employs the zero-shot model to generate
high-recall object proposals. These proposals are then refined for high
precision by a compact classifier trained in real-time on only a handful of
user-annotated examples - drastically reducing the high costs of RS imagery
annotation.The core of our framework is FLAME, a one-step active learning
strategy that selects the most informative samples for training. FLAME
identifies, on the fly, uncertain marginal candidates near the decision
boundary using density estimation, followed by clustering to ensure sample
diversity. This efficient sampling technique achieves high accuracy without
costly full-model fine-tuning and enables instant adaptation, within less then
a minute, which is significantly faster than state-of-the-art alternatives.Our
method consistently surpasses state-of-the-art performance on RS benchmarks,
establishing a practical and resource-efficient framework for adapting
foundation models to specific user needs.

Conclusion: PALE框架提供了一种无需人工标注的有效幻觉检测方法，具有强大的泛化能力和实际应用价值。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have garnered significant interest in AI
community. Despite their impressive generation capabilities, they have been
found to produce misleading or fabricated information, a phenomenon known as
hallucinations. Consequently, hallucination detection has become critical to
ensure the reliability of LLM-generated content. One primary challenge in
hallucination detection is the scarcity of well-labeled datasets containing
both truthful and hallucinated outputs. To address this issue, we introduce
Prompt-guided data Augmented haLlucination dEtection (PALE), a novel framework
that leverages prompt-guided responses from LLMs as data augmentation for
hallucination detection. This strategy can generate both truthful and
hallucinated data under prompt guidance at a relatively low cost. To more
effectively evaluate the truthfulness of the sparse intermediate embeddings
produced by LLMs, we introduce an estimation metric called the Contrastive
Mahalanobis Score (CM Score). This score is based on modeling the distributions
of truthful and hallucinated data in the activation space. CM Score employs a
matrix decomposition approach to more accurately capture the underlying
structure of these distributions. Importantly, our framework does not require
additional human annotations, offering strong generalizability and practicality
for real-world applications. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PALE
achieves superior hallucination detection performance, outperforming the
competitive baseline by a significant margin of 6.55%.

Motivation: 传统AI天气预测方法依赖再分析数据，存在数据同化偏差和时间差异问题。观测预测作为一种变革性范式，旨在将AIWP从再分析数据中解放出来。

Method: 提出DAWP框架，包含AIDA模块（使用掩码多模态自编码器同化不规则卫星观测标记）和时空解耦变换器（通过跨区域边界条件学习观测空间动态）。

Result: 实验表明AIDA初始化显著提高了AIWP的推出效率和性能，DAWP在全球降水预测中展现出应用潜力。

Conclusion: DAWP框架成功实现了在完整观测空间中的AI天气预测，解决了不规则高分辨率观测数据的学习挑战，为天气预测提供了新范式。

Abstract: Weather prediction is a critical task for human society, where impressive
progress has been made by training artificial intelligence weather prediction
(AIWP) methods with reanalysis data. However, reliance on reanalysis data
limits the AIWPs with shortcomings, including data assimilation biases and
temporal discrepancies. To liberate AIWPs from the reanalysis data, observation
forecasting emerges as a transformative paradigm for weather prediction. One of
the key challenges in observation forecasting is learning spatiotemporal
dynamics across disparate measurement systems with irregular high-resolution
observation data, which constrains the design and prediction of AIWPs. To this
end, we propose our DAWP as an innovative framework to enable AIWPs to operate
in a complete observation space by initialization with an artificial
intelligence data assimilation (AIDA) module. Specifically, our AIDA module
applies a mask multi-modality autoencoder(MMAE)for assimilating irregular
satellite observation tokens encoded by mask ViT-VAEs. For AIWP, we introduce a
spatiotemporal decoupling transformer with cross-regional boundary conditioning
(CBC), learning the dynamics in observation space, to enable sub-image-based
global observation forecasting. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that AIDA
initialization significantly improves the roll out and efficiency of AIWP.
Additionally, we show that DAWP holds promising potential to be applied in
global precipitation forecasting.

Conclusion: Cog-Rethinker通过分层元认知方法有效解决了LLMs推理训练中的样本效率问题，为弱LLMs的推理能力提升提供了有效途径。

Abstract: Contemporary progress in large language models (LLMs) has revealed notable
inferential capacities via reinforcement learning (RL) employing verifiable
reward, facilitating the development of O1 and R1-like reasoning models.
Directly training from base models with RL is called zero-RL. However, previous
works rely upon activating LLMs' inherent capacities through fixed prompt
templates. This strategy introduces substantial sampling inefficiencies for
weak LLMs, as the majority of problems generate invalid outputs during
accuracy-driven filtration in reasoning tasks, which causes a waste of samples.
To solve this issue, we propose Cog-Rethinker, a novel hierarchical
metacognitive RL framework for LLM reasoning. Our Cog-Rethinker mainly focuses
on the rollout procedure in RL training. After the direct rollout, our
Cog-Rethinker improves sample utilization in a hierarchical metacognitive
two-stage framework. By leveraging human cognition during solving problems,
firstly, it prompts policy to decompose zero-accuracy problems into subproblems
to produce final reasoning results. Secondly, with zero-accuracy problems in
previous rollout stage, it further prompts policy to refine these answers by
referencing previous wrong solutions. Moreover, to enable cold-start of the two
new reasoning patterns and maintain train-test consistency across prompt
templates, our Cog-Rethinker applies supervised fine-tuning on the policy using
correct samples of the two stages with direct rollout template. Experimental
results demonstrate Cog-Rethinker's superior performance on various
mathematical reasoning benchmarks, we also analyzed its improved sample
efficiency that accelerates convergence compared to baseline methods.

Conclusion: AMiD框架通过系统化的辅助分布设计和散度推广，有效解决了知识蒸馏中的关键挑战，为大型语言模型的压缩提供了更优解决方案。

Abstract: Autoregressive large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable
improvement across many tasks but incur high computational and memory costs.
Knowledge distillation (KD) mitigates this issue by transferring knowledge from
a large teacher to a smaller student through distributional alignment. Previous
studies have proposed various discrepancy metrics, but the capacity gap and
training instability caused by near-zero probabilities, stemming from the
high-dimensional output of LLMs, remain fundamental limitations. To overcome
these challenges, several approaches implicitly or explicitly incorporating
assistant distribution have recently been proposed. However, the past proposals
of assistant distributions have been a fragmented approach without a systematic
investigation of the interpolation path and the divergence. This paper proposes
$\alpha$-mixture assistant distribution, a novel generalized family of
assistant distributions, and $\alpha$-mixture distillation, coined AMiD, a
unified framework for KD using the assistant distribution. The $\alpha$-mixture
assistant distribution provides a continuous extension of the assistant
distribution by introducing a new distribution design variable $\alpha$, which
has been fixed in all previous approaches. Furthermore, AMiD generalizes the
family of divergences used with the assistant distributions based on
optimality, which has also been restricted in previous works. Through extensive
experiments, we demonstrate that AMiD offers superior performance and training
stability by leveraging a broader and theoretically grounded assistant
distribution space.

Conclusion: LLM中的推理可能由算法原语的组合几何结构支持，原语可以跨任务和跨模型迁移，推理微调增强了跨领域的算法泛化能力。

Abstract: How do latent and inference time computations enable large language models
(LLMs) to solve multi-step reasoning? We introduce a framework for tracing and
steering algorithmic primitives that underlie model reasoning. Our approach
links reasoning traces to internal activation patterns and evaluates
algorithmic primitives by injecting them into residual streams and measuring
their effect on reasoning steps and task performance. We consider four
benchmarks: Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP), 3SAT, AIME, and graph
navigation. We operationalize primitives by clustering neural activations and
labeling their matched reasoning traces. We then apply function vector methods
to derive primitive vectors as reusable compositional building blocks of
reasoning. Primitive vectors can be combined through addition, subtraction, and
scalar operations, revealing a geometric logic in activation space. Cross-task
and cross-model evaluations (Phi-4, Phi-4-Reasoning, Llama-3-8B) show both
shared and task-specific primitives. Notably, comparing Phi-4 with its
reasoning-finetuned variant highlights compositional generalization after
finetuning: Phi-4-Reasoning exhibits more systematic use of verification and
path-generation primitives. Injecting the associated primitive vectors in
Phi-4-Base induces behavioral hallmarks associated with Phi-4-Reasoning.
Together, these findings demonstrate that reasoning in LLMs may be supported by
a compositional geometry of algorithmic primitives, that primitives transfer
cross-task and cross-model, and that reasoning finetuning strengthens
algorithmic generalization across domains.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GRPO算法驱动的RLVR方法在提升LLM推理能力时存在不一致性，其OOD泛化能力有限，只能强化预训练偏见而非发现全新解决方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究GRPO在不同推理领域表现不一致的原因，探究其在什么条件下能改善推理和实现OOD泛化。

Method: 从数据分布角度进行理论分析，证明GRPO是保守的重加权方案；通过从头训练transformer进行受控实验，评估在推理深度、输入长度、标记表示和组合性等方面的泛化能力。

Result: GRPO的OOD改进仅在目标任务与模型预训练偏见一致时出现，而ID任务收益随性能饱和而减少；GRPO无法发现全新解决方案，只能锐化预训练偏见。

Conclusion: GRPO不是通用的推理增强器，而是强化预训练偏见的工具；需要开发能超越预训练起源扩展模型能力的新算法。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR), primarily driven by
the Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm, is a leading approach
for enhancing the reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). Despite
its wide adoption, GRPO's gains are often inconsistent; for instance, a model
may show significant improvement in one reasoning domain, like mathematics, yet
remain stagnant in another, such as medicine. This inconsistency raises a
critical question: under what conditions does GRPO improve reasoning and
generalize out-of-distribution (OOD)? We investigate this from a data
distribution perspective. We first prove theoretically that GRPO is a
conservative reweighting scheme, bounded by the base model's distribution and
thus unable to discover completely novel solutions. We further validate this in
carefully designed controlled studies by training transformers from scratch,
evaluating generalization across reasoning depth, input length, token
representation, and compositionality. Our results provide a principled
explanation for GRPO's boundaries: OOD improvement emerges only when the target
task aligns with the model's pretrained biases, while gains on in-distribution
(ID) tasks diminish as performance saturates. This reframes GRPO not as a
universal reasoning enhancer but as a tool that sharpens pretraining biases.
Our findings motivate future development of algorithms that can expand a
model's capabilities beyond its pretraining origin.

Result: 在特定麻将推理任务上，学生模型准确率比GPT-4o教师基线提高四倍，同时降低延迟和成本而不牺牲准确性。

Conclusion: Stratos在垂直领域LLM部署中展现出良好前景。

Abstract: The growing industrial demand for customized and cost-efficient large
language models (LLMs) is fueled by the rise of vertical, domain-specific tasks
and the need to optimize performance under constraints such as latency and
budget. Knowledge distillation, as an efficient model compression and transfer
technique, offers a feasible solution. However, existing distillation
frameworks often require manual intervention and struggle to meet such complex
user-defined distillation requirements. To bridge this gap, we propose Stratos,
an end-to-end LLM distillation pipeline that automates server and model
selection, knowledge distillation, and deployment in distributed cloud
environments. Given user-defined constraints on model performance and system
budget, Stratos automatically selects Pareto-optimal servers, dynamically
matches teacher-student pairs, and adapts distillation strategies based on task
complexity to optimize cloud hosting. Experiments show that Stratos produces a
student model that achieves four times the accuracy of its GPT-4o teacher
baseline on a rare, domain-specific Mahjong reasoning task with reverse
synthetic data and knowledge injection. Moreover, it achieves reduced latency
and cost without compromising accuracy. These results highlight its promise for
vertical-domain LLM deployment.

Abstract: Recent work has shown that, in classification tasks, it is possible to design
decision support systems that do not require human experts to understand when
to cede agency to a classifier or when to exercise their own agency to achieve
complementarity$\unicode{x2014}$experts using these systems make more accurate
predictions than those made by the experts or the classifier alone. The key
principle underpinning these systems reduces to adaptively controlling the
level of human agency, by design. Can we use the same principle to achieve
complementarity in sequential decision making tasks? In this paper, we answer
this question affirmatively. We develop a decision support system that uses a
pre-trained AI agent to narrow down the set of actions a human can take to a
subset, and then asks the human to take an action from this action set. Along
the way, we also introduce a bandit algorithm that leverages the smoothness
properties of the action sets provided by our system to efficiently optimize
the level of human agency. To evaluate our decision support system, we conduct
a large-scale human subject study ($n = 1{,}600$) where participants play a
wildfire mitigation game. We find that participants who play the game supported
by our system outperform those who play on their own by $\sim$$30$% and the AI
agent used by our system by $>$$2$%, even though the AI agent largely
outperforms participants playing without support. We have made available the
data gathered in our human subject study as well as an open source
implementation of our system at

Motivation: 解决机器学习系统中训练数据与测试数据概率分布不一致的问题，这种分布偏移会导致预测误差，在安全关键应用中尤其危险。

Method: 采用Kolmogorov-Smirnov检验来测量分布偏移，使用KS距离来量化分布偏移程度及其对AI智能体性能的影响。

Result: 研究表明即使KS距离仅为0.02，也会导致强化学习智能体在单个交叉路口的旅行时间增加约50%，影响显著。

Conclusion: KS检验和KS距离可作为实时监测AI智能体性能退化的有效统计工具，帮助AI系统更智能地应对分布偏移问题。

Abstract: One of the major problems in Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial
Intelligence (AI) is the fact that the probability distribution of the test
data in the real world could deviate substantially from the probability
distribution of the training data set. When this happens, the predictions of an
ML system or an AI agent could involve large errors which is very troublesome
and undesirable. While this is a well-known hard problem plaguing the AI and ML
systems' accuracy and reliability, in certain applications such errors could be
critical for safety and reliability of AI and ML systems. One approach to deal
with this problem is to monitor and measure the deviation in the probability
distribution of the test data in real time and to compensate for this
deviation. In this paper, we propose and explore the use of Kolmogorov-Smirnov
(KS) Test for measuring the distribution shift and we show how the KS distance
can be used to quantify the distribution shift and its impact on an AI agent's
performance. Our results suggest that KS distance could be used as a valuable
statistical tool for monitoring and measuring the distribution shift. More
specifically, it is shown that even a distance of KS=0.02 could lead to about
50\% increase in the travel time at a single intersection using a Reinforcement
Learning agent which is quite significant. It is hoped that the use of KS Test
and KS distance in AI-based smart transportation could be an important step
forward for gauging the performance degradation of an AI agent in real time and
this, in turn, could help the AI agent to cope with the distribution shift in a
more informed manner.

Conclusion: 生成AI应被理解为专门化过程的涌现配置，而非内容的直接合成，需要对生成AI的理解进行重新定位。

Abstract: This paper examines the evolving nature of internal representations in
generative visual models, focusing on the conceptual and technical shift from
GANs and VAEs to diffusion-based architectures. Drawing on Beatrice Fazi's
account of synthesis as the amalgamation of distributed representations, we
propose a distinction between "synthesis in a strict sense", where a compact
latent space wholly determines the generative process, and "synthesis in a
broad sense," which characterizes models whose representational labor is
distributed across layers. Through close readings of model architectures and a
targeted experimental setup that intervenes in layerwise representations, we
show how diffusion models fragment the burden of representation and thereby
challenge assumptions of unified internal space. By situating these findings
within media theoretical frameworks and critically engaging with metaphors such
as the latent space and the Platonic Representation Hypothesis, we argue for a
reorientation of how generative AI is understood: not as a direct synthesis of
content, but as an emergent configuration of specialized processes.

Conclusion: 该方法使动态数据筛选在实践中变得高效且可扩展，为数据中心学习提供了实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Data-centric learning emphasizes curating high-quality training samples to
boost performance rather than designing new architectures. A central problem is
to estimate the influence of training sample efficiently. Prior studies largely
focus on static influence measured on a converged model, overlooking how data
valuation dynamically changes during optimization. This omission neglects the
dynamic nature of sample influence during optimization, especially in deep
models. To address the computational burden of frequent influence estimation,
we develop a layer-aware online estimator that requires only loss-to-output
gradients. This design avoids parameter-level and full-network gradients while
preserving ranking fidelity. Extensive experiments across LLM pretraining,
fine-tuning, and image classification show our method improves accuracy with
substantially lower time and memory cost, making dynamic data curation
efficient and scalable in practice.

variables that describe the system status, such as valve on/off or day of the
week. Existing TSFMs often overlook the distinct categorical nature of state
variables and their critical role as conditions, typically treating them
uniformly with numerical variables. This inappropriate modeling approach
prevents the model from fully leveraging state information and even leads to a
significant degradation in detection performance after state variables are
integrated. To address this critical limitation, this paper proposes a novel
STate-aware AdapteR (STAR). STAR is a plug-and-play module designed to enhance
the capability of TSFMs in modeling and leveraging state variables during the
fine-tuning stage. Specifically, STAR comprisesthree core components: (1) We
design an Identity-guided State Encoder, whicheffectively captures the complex
categorical semantics of state variables through a learnable State Memory. (2)
We propose a Conditional Bottleneck Adapter, which dynamically generates
low-rank adaptation parameters conditioned on the current state, thereby
flexibly injecting the influence of state variables into the backbone model.
(3) We also introduce a Numeral-State Matching module to more effectively
detect anomalies inherent to the state variables themselves. Extensive
experiments conducted on real-world datasets demonstrate that STAR can improve
the performance of existing TSFMs on MTSAD.

Abstract: Timely and reliable decision-making is vital for flood emergency response,
yet it remains severely hindered by limited and imprecise situational awareness
due to various budget and data accessibility constraints. Traditional flood
management systems often rely on in-situ sensors to calibrate remote
sensing-based large-scale flood depth forecasting models, and further take
flood depth estimates to optimize flood response decisions. However, these
approaches often take fixed, decision task-agnostic strategies to decide where
to put in-situ sensors (e.g., maximize overall information gain) and train
flood forecasting models (e.g., minimize average forecasting errors), but
overlook that systems with the same sensing gain and average forecasting errors
may lead to distinct decisions. To address this, we introduce a novel
decision-focused framework that strategically selects locations for in-situ
sensor placement and optimize spatio-temporal flood forecasting models to
optimize downstream flood response decision regrets. Our end-to-end pipeline
integrates four components: a contextual scoring network, a differentiable
sensor selection module under hard budget constraints, a spatio-temporal flood
reconstruction and forecasting model, and a differentiable decision layer
tailored to task-specific objectives. Central to our approach is the
incorporation of Implicit Maximum Likelihood Estimation (I-MLE) to enable
gradient-based learning over discrete sensor configurations, and probabilistic
decision heads to enable differentiable approximation to various constrained
disaster response tasks.

Result: 渐进神经网络实现了稳定高效的知识迁移，避免了灾难性遗忘，对预训练过拟合具有鲁棒性；而微调方法对预训练时长敏感且容易发生知识遗忘。

Conclusion: 渐进神经网络为鲁棒、可扩展和计算高效的流体控制提供了有前景的迁移学习框架，特别适用于源任务和目标任务差异较大的复杂场景。

Abstract: This work investigates transfer learning strategies to accelerate deep
reinforcement learning (DRL) for multifidelity control of chaotic fluid flows.
Progressive neural networks (PNNs), a modular architecture designed to preserve
and reuse knowledge across tasks, are employed for the first time in the
context of DRL-based flow control. In addition, a comprehensive benchmarking of
conventional fine-tuning strategies is conducted, evaluating their performance,
convergence behavior, and ability to retain transferred knowledge. The
Kuramoto-Sivashinsky (KS) system is employed as a benchmark to examine how
knowledge encoded in control policies, trained in low-fidelity environments,
can be effectively transferred to high-fidelity settings. Systematic
evaluations show that while fine-tuning can accelerate convergence, it is
highly sensitive to pretraining duration and prone to catastrophic forgetting.
In contrast, PNNs enable stable and efficient transfer by preserving prior
knowledge and providing consistent performance gains, and are notably robust to
overfitting during the pretraining phase. Layer-wise sensitivity analysis
further reveals how PNNs dynamically reuse intermediate representations from
the source policy while progressively adapting deeper layers to the target
task. Moreover, PNNs remain effective even when the source and target
environments differ substantially, such as in cases with mismatched physical
regimes or control objectives, where fine-tuning strategies often result in
suboptimal adaptation or complete failure of knowledge transfer. The results
highlight the potential of novel transfer learning frameworks for robust,
scalable, and computationally efficient flow control that can potentially be
applied to more complex flow configurations.

TL;DR: AirDbM是一种专门用于翼型优化的设计变形方法，通过从UIUC翼型数据库中选择12个最优基线翼型，显著降低设计空间维度，在保持高重构精度的同时实现快速收敛和更好的多目标优化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 翼型几何优化需要探索多样化的设计，同时尽可能减少设计变量数量，以提高优化效率和性能。

Method: 从UIUC翼型数据库的1600多个形状中顺序选择最优的12个基线翼型，通过设计变形方法重构翼型几何，最大化设计容量。

Result: 用12个基线翼型重构了99%的数据库，平均绝对误差低于0.005；在多目标气动优化中实现了快速收敛和更大的超体积，发现了具有增强升阻比的新帕累托最优解。

Conclusion: AirDbM在翼型优化中表现出色，特别是在强化学习应用中相比传统参数化方法具有更好的适应性，展示了设计变形方法在机器学习驱动设计中的广阔潜力。

Abstract: Effective airfoil geometry optimization requires exploring a diverse range of
designs using as few design variables as possible. This study introduces
AirDbM, a Design-by-Morphing (DbM) approach specialized for airfoil
optimization that systematically reduces design-space dimensionality. AirDbM
selects an optimal set of 12 baseline airfoils from the UIUC airfoil database,
which contains over 1,600 shapes, by sequentially adding the baseline that most
increases the design capacity. With these baselines, AirDbM reconstructs 99 \%
of the database with a mean absolute error below 0.005, which matches the
performance of a previous DbM approach that used more baselines. In
multi-objective aerodynamic optimization, AirDbM demonstrates rapid convergence
and achieves a Pareto front with a greater hypervolume than that of the
previous larger-baseline study, where new Pareto-optimal solutions are
discovered with enhanced lift-to-drag ratios at moderate stall tolerances.
Furthermore, AirDbM demonstrates outstanding adaptability for reinforcement
learning (RL) agents in generating airfoil geometry when compared to
conventional airfoil parameterization methods, implying the broader potential
of DbM in machine learning-driven design.

Conclusion: 特征驱动强化学习为光伏生产商的主动日内参与提供了实用、数据高效且可操作部署的途径

Abstract: Photovoltaic (PV) operators face substantial uncertainty in generation and
short-term electricity prices. Continuous intraday markets enable producers to
adjust their positions in real time, potentially improving revenues and
reducing imbalance costs. We propose a feature-driven reinforcement learning
(RL) approach for PV intraday trading that integrates data-driven features into
the state and learns bidding policies in a sequential decision framework. The
problem is cast as a Markov Decision Process with a reward that balances
trading profit and imbalance penalties and is solved with Proximal Policy
Optimization (PPO) using a predominantly linear, interpretable policy. Trained
on historical market data and evaluated out-of-sample, the strategy
consistently outperforms benchmark baselines across diverse scenarios.
Extensive validation shows rapid convergence, real-time inference, and
transparent decision rules. Learned weights highlight the central role of
market microstructure and historical features. Taken together, these results
indicate that feature-driven RL offers a practical, data-efficient, and
operationally deployable pathway for active intraday participation by PV
producers.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 发现预训练大语言模型在代码领域微调时存在记忆障碍问题，即模型对下游代码数据的强记忆会阻碍其学习新的、可泛化的代码知识。

Method: 提出基于信息瓶颈的微调方法(IB-FT)，在代码数据的隐藏表示上应用IB惩罚，压缩冗余的记忆特征同时保留任务相关信息。

Result: 在两个代码基准测试(OriGen和Evol-CodeAlpaca-V1)上的实验表明，IB-FT显著缓解了记忆障碍，提高了top-1性能(Pass@1)，在更严格的多样本度量Pass@k(m)下获得了更稳定的增益。

Conclusion: IB-FT方法有效克服了代码生成中的记忆障碍问题，相比传统微调方法在代码生成任务上具有更好的性能和稳定性。

Abstract: Adapting pretrained large language models (LLMs) to code domains via
supervised fine-tuning (FT) has been commonly used for code generation.
However, we identify a previously underappreciated failure mode, the
memorization barrier, where strong memorization of downstream code data in the
base model could trap optimization and prevent the standard FT from effectively
acquiring new, generalizable code knowledge. To overcome this barrier, we
propose the information bottleneck (IB)-guided fine-tuning, termed IB-FT, which
applies an IB penalty on hidden representations of the code data to compress
spurious, memorized features while preserving task-relevant information.
Extensive experiments on two code benchmarks (OriGen and Evol-CodeAlpaca-V1)
show that IB-FT substantially alleviates the memorization barrier, improves
top-1 performance (Pass@$1$), and yields far more stable gains under the
stricter multi-sample metric Pass@$k^{(m)}$ (a problem counts as solved only if
at least $m$ of $k$ samples pass unit tests) compared with conventional FT.

Motivation: 现有深度学习方法仅使用单体级描述符表示整个聚合物，忽略了聚合物构象中的全局结构信息，限制了实际性能。同时该领域缺乏能够有效支持多样化下游任务的通用基础模型。

Method: 将聚合物构象分解为局部构象序列，通过掩码自回归建模重建局部构象，并生成其方向变换来恢复相应的聚合物构象。通过分子动力学模拟构建首个高质量聚合物构象数据集。

Result: 实验表明PolyConFM在多样化下游任务上持续优于代表性任务特定方法。

Conclusion: PolyConFM为聚合物科学提供了一个通用且强大的工具，推动了该领域的发展。

Abstract: Polymers, macromolecules formed from covalently bonded monomers, underpin
countless technologies and are indispensable to modern life. While deep
learning is advancing polymer science, existing methods typically represent the
whole polymer solely through monomer-level descriptors, overlooking the global
structural information inherent in polymer conformations, which ultimately
limits their practical performance. Moreover, this field still lacks a
universal foundation model that can effectively support diverse downstream
tasks, thereby severely constraining progress. To address these challenges, we
introduce PolyConFM, the first polymer foundation model that unifies polymer
modeling and design through conformation-centric generative pretraining.
Recognizing that each polymer conformation can be decomposed into a sequence of
local conformations (i.e., those of its repeating units), we pretrain PolyConFM
under the conditional generation paradigm, reconstructing these local
conformations via masked autoregressive (MAR) modeling and further generating
their orientation transformations to recover the corresponding polymer
conformation. Besides, we construct the first high-quality polymer conformation
dataset via molecular dynamics simulations to mitigate data sparsity, thereby
enabling conformation-centric pretraining. Experiments demonstrate that
PolyConFM consistently outperforms representative task-specific methods on
diverse downstream tasks, equipping polymer science with a universal and
powerful tool.

versatility and utility for medical discovery at scale.

Conclusion: RoBCtrl是首个将扩散模型应用于模拟演化社交机器人行为的框架，成功证明了GNN检测器在面对精心设计的对抗攻击时的脆弱性。

Abstract: Social networks have become a crucial source of real-time information for
individuals. The influence of social bots within these platforms has garnered
considerable attention from researchers, leading to the development of numerous
detection technologies. However, the vulnerability and robustness of these
detection methods is still underexplored. Existing Graph Neural Network
(GNN)-based methods cannot be directly applied due to the issues of limited
control over social agents, the black-box nature of bot detectors, and the
heterogeneity of bots. To address these challenges, this paper proposes the
first adversarial multi-agent Reinforcement learning framework for social Bot
control attacks (RoBCtrl) targeting GNN-based social bot detectors.
Specifically, we use a diffusion model to generate high-fidelity bot accounts
by reconstructing existing account data with minor modifications, thereby
evading detection on social platforms. To the best of our knowledge, this is
the first application of diffusion models to mimic the behavior of evolving
social bots effectively. We then employ a Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning
(MARL) method to simulate bots adversarial behavior. We categorize social
accounts based on their influence and budget. Different agents are then
employed to control bot accounts across various categories, optimizing the
attachment strategy through reinforcement learning. Additionally, a
hierarchical state abstraction based on structural entropy is designed to
accelerate the reinforcement learning. Extensive experiments on social bot
detection datasets demonstrate that our framework can effectively undermine the
performance of GNN-based detectors.

Motivation: 传统向量量化方法处理静态输入，而GCQ旨在通过动作条件化码本实现时空联合压缩，作为统一的世界模型。

Conclusion: GCQ不仅为高效序列建模提供计算工具，还为神经系统中网格状编码的形成提供理论视角。

Abstract: We propose Grid-like Code Quantization (GCQ), a brain-inspired method for
compressing observation-action sequences into discrete representations using
grid-like patterns in attractor dynamics. Unlike conventional vector
quantization approaches that operate on static inputs, GCQ performs
spatiotemporal compression through an action-conditioned codebook, where
codewords are derived from continuous attractor neural networks and dynamically
selected based on actions. This enables GCQ to jointly compress space and time,
serving as a unified world model. The resulting representation supports
long-horizon prediction, goal-directed planning, and inverse modeling.
Experiments across diverse tasks demonstrate GCQ's effectiveness in compact
encoding and downstream performance. Our work offers both a computational tool
for efficient sequence modeling and a theoretical perspective on the formation
of grid-like codes in neural systems.

TL;DR: AMS-Quant是一种新的浮点量化方法，通过尾数位共享和自适应搜索技术，首次将量化位宽扩展到非整数位（如FP5.33、FP4.25），在保持精度的同时显著加速大语言模型推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型的巨大参数量带来了存储和推理效率瓶颈，浮点量化虽然能加速推理，但传统方法仅限于整数位宽，限制了量化效果的进一步提升。

Method: 提出两种新技术：1）尾数位共享 - 将k个量化权重分组共享最低有效尾数位；2）自适应搜索 - 使用离线优化策略最小化共享带来的精度损失。

Result: 在大型数据集和模型上的实验表明，AMS-Quant可将模型量化为FP5.33-e2m3和FP4.25-e2m2，相比FP16推理分别实现2.8倍和3.2倍的解码加速，且精度损失可忽略不计。

Conclusion: AMS-Quant通过引入非整数位宽量化，成功接近量化最佳点，在保持模型精度的同时显著提升推理效率，为大语言模型部署提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in
various kinds of tasks, while the billion or even trillion parameters bring
storage and efficiency bottlenecks for inference. Quantization, particularly
floating-point quantization, is known to be capable of speeding up LLM
inference by reducing memory footprint and data movement during the inference
process. For the first time, we advance the floating-point quantization
exploration from integer bitwidths to non-integer bit-widths, namely AMS-Quant,
to further approach the quantization sweet spot. AMS-Quant incorporates two
novel techniques to put it into effect: (1) it proposes Mantissa-bit Sharing,
which groups k quantized weights and lets them share the least significant
mantissa bit, allowing us to further approach the minimum quantization
bit-width without accuracy loss. (2) It introduces Adaptive Searching, which
employs an offline optimization strategy to minimize the accuracy degradation
introduced by sharing. Moreover, AMS-Quant is also prototyped as efficient CUDA
Linear kernels, which translates memory savings into wall-clock latency
reduction by reducing memory access. Extensive experiments on large-scale
datasets and models show that AMS-Quant can quantize the model to FP-5.33-e2m3
and FP4.25-e2m2, and significantly speed up the LLM decoding over FP16
inference (2.8x and 3.2x), with negligible accuracy loss.

Abstract: Autonomous agents capable of operating complex graphical user interfaces
(GUIs) have the potential to transform desktop automation. While recent
advances in large language models (LLMs) have significantly improved UI
understanding, navigating full-window, multi-application desktop environments
remains a major challenge. Data availability is limited by costly manual
annotation, closed-source datasets and surface-level synthetic pipelines. We
introduce GUIrilla, an automated scalable framework that systematically
explores applications via native accessibility APIs to address the critical
data collection challenge in GUI automation. Our framework focuses on macOS -
an ecosystem with limited representation in current UI datasets - though many
of its components are designed for broader cross-platform applicability.
GUIrilla organizes discovered interface elements and crawler actions into
hierarchical GUI graphs and employs specialized interaction handlers to achieve
comprehensive application coverage. Using the application graphs from GUIrilla
crawler, we construct and release GUIrilla-Task, a large-scale dataset of
27,171 functionally grounded tasks across 1,108 macOS applications, each
annotated with full-desktop and window-level screenshots, accessibility
metadata, and semantic action traces. Empirical results show that tuning
LLM-based agents on GUIrilla-Task significantly improves performance on
downstream UI tasks, outperforming synthetic baselines on the ScreenSpot Pro
benchmark while using 97% less data. We also release macapptree, an open-source
library for reproducible collection of structured accessibility metadata, along
with the full GUIrilla-Task dataset, the manually verified GUIrilla-Gold

Abstract: Accurate traffic forecasting is a core technology for building Intelligent
Transportation Systems (ITS), enabling better urban resource allocation and
improved travel experiences. With growing urbanization, traffic congestion has
intensified, highlighting the need for reliable and responsive forecasting
models. In recent years, deep learning, particularly Graph Neural Networks
(GNNs), has emerged as the mainstream paradigm in traffic forecasting. GNNs can
effectively capture complex spatial dependencies in road network topology and
dynamic temporal evolution patterns in traffic flow data. Foundational models
such as STGCN and GraphWaveNet, along with more recent developments including
STWave and D2STGNN, have achieved impressive performance on standard traffic
datasets. These approaches incorporate sophisticated graph convolutional
structures and temporal modeling mechanisms, demonstrating particular
effectiveness in capturing and forecasting traffic patterns characterized by
periodic regularities. To address this challenge, researchers have explored
various ways to incorporate event information. Early attempts primarily relied
on manually engineered event features. For instance, some approaches introduced
manually defined incident effect scores or constructed specific subgraphs for
different event-induced traffic conditions. While these methods somewhat
enhance responsiveness to specific events, their core drawback lies in a heavy
reliance on domain experts' prior knowledge, making generalization to diverse
and complex unknown events difficult, and low-dimensional manual features often
lead to the loss of rich semantic details.

Abstract: The recent development of foundation models for time series data has
generated considerable interest in using such models across a variety of
applications. Although foundation models achieve state-of-the-art predictive
performance, their calibration properties remain relatively underexplored,
despite the fact that calibration can be critical for many practical
applications. In this paper, we investigate the calibration-related properties
of five recent time series foundation models and two competitive baselines. We
perform a series of systematic evaluations assessing model calibration (i.e.,
over- or under-confidence), effects of varying prediction heads, and
calibration under long-term autoregressive forecasting. We find that time
series foundation models are consistently better calibrated than baseline
models and tend not to be either systematically over- or under-confident, in
contrast to the overconfidence often seen in other deep learning models.

Abstract: Accurate voltage estimation in distribution networks is critical for
real-time monitoring and increasing the reliability of the grid. As DER
penetration and distribution level voltage variability increase, robust
distribution system state estimation (DSSE) has become more essential to
maintain safe and efficient operations. Traditional DSSE techniques, however,
struggle with sparse measurements and the scale of modern feeders, limiting
their scalability to large networks. This paper presents a hierarchical graph
neural network for substation-level voltage estimation that exploits both
electrical topology and physical features, while remaining robust to the low
observability levels common to real-world distribution networks. Leveraging the
public SMART-DS datasets, the model is trained and evaluated on thousands of
buses across multiple substations and DER penetration scenarios. Comprehensive
experiments demonstrate that the proposed method achieves up to 2 times lower
RMSE than alternative data-driven models, and maintains high accuracy with as
little as 1\% measurement coverage. The results highlight the potential of GNNs
to enable scalable, reproducible, and data-driven voltage monitoring for
distribution systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出一种残差学习范式，使用快速DC最优潮流解作为基线，学习非线性修正以提供完整的AC最优潮流解，实现了比传统AC OPF求解器更低的误差和更快的运行速度。

Motivation: 解决非线性AC最优潮流问题的计算瓶颈，实现实时电网运行决策。

Method: 使用拓扑感知图神经网络，结合局部注意力和两级DC特征集成，采用物理信息损失函数来保证AC潮流可行性和运行限制。

Result: 在57、118和2000总线系统上的评估显示，MSE降低约25%，可行性误差减少高达3倍，运行速度提升高达13倍。

Conclusion: 残差学习是线性近似与AC可行OPF之间的实用且可扩展的桥梁，能够实现近实时的运行决策。

Abstract: Solving the nonlinear AC optimal power flow (AC OPF) problem remains a major
computational bottleneck for real-time grid operations. In this paper, we
propose a residual learning paradigm that uses fast DC optimal power flow (DC
OPF) solutions as a baseline, and learns only the nonlinear corrections
required to provide the full AC-OPF solution. The method utilizes a
topology-aware Graph Neural Network with local attention and two-level DC
feature integration, trained using a physics-informed loss that enforces AC
power-flow feasibility and operational limits. Evaluations on OPFData for 57-,
118-, and 2000-bus systems show around 25% lower MSE, up to 3X reduction in
feasibility error, and up to 13X runtime speedup compared to conventional AC
OPF solvers. The model maintains accuracy under N-1 contingencies and scales
efficiently to large networks. These results demonstrate that residual learning
is a practical and scalable bridge between linear approximations and
AC-feasible OPF, enabling near real-time operational decision making.

Abstract: Personalized Federated Learning (PFL) has emerged as a critical research
frontier addressing data heterogeneity issue across distributed clients. Novel
model architectures and collaboration mechanisms are engineered to accommodate
statistical disparities while producing client-specific models. Parameter
decoupling represents a promising paradigm for maintaining model performance in
PFL frameworks. However, the communication efficiency of many existing methods
remains suboptimal, sustaining substantial communication burdens that impede
practical deployment. To bridge this gap, we propose Federated Learning with
Programmed Update and Reduced INformation (FedPURIN), a novel framework that
strategically identifies critical parameters for transmission through an
integer programming formulation. This mathematically grounded strategy is
seamlessly integrated into a sparse aggregation scheme, achieving a significant
communication reduction while preserving the efficacy. Comprehensive
evaluations on standard image classification benchmarks under varied non-IID
conditions demonstrate competitive performance relative to state-of-the-art
methods, coupled with quantifiable communication reduction through sparse
aggregation. The framework establishes a new paradigm for
communication-efficient PFL, particularly advantageous for edge intelligence
systems operating with heterogeneous data sources.

Abstract: Neural operators have emerged as a powerful data-driven paradigm for solving
Partial Differential Equations (PDEs), offering orders-of-magnitude
acceleration over traditional solvers. However, existing approaches still
suffer from limited accuracy and scalability, particularly on irregular domains
where fluid flows exhibit rich multiscale structures. In this work, we
introduce the Multiscale Neural Operator (MNO), a new architecture for
Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) on three-dimensional (3D) unstructured point
clouds. MNO explicitly decomposes information across three scales: a global
dimension-shrinkage attention module for long-range dependencies, a local graph
attention module for neighborhood-level interactions, and a micro point-wise
attention module for fine-grained details. This design preserves multiscale
inductive biases while remaining computationally efficient. We evaluate MNO on
four diverse benchmarks, covering both steady-state and unsteady flow scenarios
with up to 300K points. Across all tasks, MNO consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines, reducing prediction errors by 5% to 40% and
demonstrating improved robustness in challenging 3D CFD problems. Our results
highlight the importance of explicit multiscale design for neural operators and
establish MNO as a scalable framework for learning complex fluid dynamics on
irregular domains.

Conclusion: 随机矩阵理论为Transformer训练监控和诊断提供了有效工具，提出的早停准则具有一致性和实用性。

Abstract: This work introduces a novel theoretical framework grounded in Random Matrix
Theory (RMT) for analyzing Transformer training dynamics. We focus on the
underlying mechanisms that drive performance improvements and derive principled
early-stopping criteria. Empirically, we observe that the spectral density of
the shallow self-attention matrix V consistently evolves into a heavy-tailed
distribution. Utilizing the PL (Power Law) fit to this matrix as a probe, we
demarcate training into three stages: structural exploration, heavy-tailed
structure stabilization, and convergence saturation. This staging provides
guidance for preliminary stopping decisions. Crucially, we propose two
consistent and validation-free criteria: a quantitative metric for heavy-tailed
dynamics and a novel spectral signature indicative of convergence. The strong
alignment between these criteria highlights the utility of RMT for monitoring
and diagnosing the progression of Transformer model training.

Result: 在MNIST、Fashion-MNIST、EMNIST和CIFAR-10数据集上评估，从int8到int1的整数精度范围内，相比传统四舍五入量化方法表现更优。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效提升神经网络量化后的精度，通过问题分解实现了高效求解，为低精度神经网络部署提供了可行方案。

Abstract: This work introduces a post-training quantization (PTQ) method for dense
neural networks via a novel ADAROUND-based QUBO formulation. Using the
Frobenius distance between the theoretical output and the dequantized output
(before the activation function) as the objective, an explicit QUBO whose
binary variables represent the rounding choice for each weight and bias is
obtained. Additionally, by exploiting the structure of the coefficient QUBO
matrix, the global problem can be exactly decomposed into $n$ independent
subproblems of size $f+1$, which can be efficiently solved using some
heuristics such as simulated annealing. The approach is evaluated on MNIST,
Fashion-MNIST, EMNIST, and CIFAR-10 across integer precisions from int8 to int1
and compared with a round-to-nearest traditional quantization methodology.

Conclusion: CONEC-LoRA通过知识整合、随机分类器和辅助网络的有效组合，在领域增量学习中取得了显著优于现有方法的性能。

Abstract: Domain Incremental Learning (DIL) is a continual learning sub-branch that
aims to address never-ending arrivals of new domains without catastrophic
forgetting problems. Despite the advent of parameter-efficient fine-tuning
(PEFT) approaches, existing works create task-specific LoRAs overlooking shared
knowledge across tasks. Inaccurate selection of task-specific LORAs during
inference results in significant drops in accuracy, while existing works rely
on linear or prototype-based classifiers, which have suboptimal generalization
powers. Our paper proposes continual knowledge consolidation low rank
adaptation (CONEC-LoRA) addressing the DIL problems. CONEC-LoRA is developed
from consolidations between task-shared LORA to extract common knowledge and
task-specific LORA to embrace domain-specific knowledge. Unlike existing
approaches, CONEC-LoRA integrates the concept of a stochastic classifier whose
parameters are sampled from a distribution, thus enhancing the likelihood of
correct classifications. Last but not least, an auxiliary network is deployed
to optimally predict the task-specific LoRAs for inferences and implements the
concept of a different-depth network structure in which every layer is
connected with a local classifier to take advantage of intermediate
representations. This module integrates the ball-generator loss and
transformation module to address the synthetic sample bias problem. Our
rigorous experiments demonstrate the advantage of CONEC-LoRA over prior arts in
4 popular benchmark problems with over 5% margins.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在检测密码重用或恶意登录时往往牺牲可用性，且依赖复杂的账户共享机制，难以实际部署。需要一种既能有效预测凭据填充风险，又能保护用户隐私的解决方案。

Conclusion: 该框架能够有效量化密码重用可能性为可操作的风险评分，为防范凭据填充攻击提供了实用的解决方案，同时保障了用户隐私。

Abstract: Credential stuffing attacks have caused significant harm to online users who
frequently reuse passwords across multiple websites. While prior research has
attempted to detect users with reused passwords or identify malicious login
attempts, existing methods often compromise usability by restricting password
creation or website access, and their reliance on complex account-sharing
mechanisms hinders real-world deployment. To address these limitations, we
propose PassREfinder-FL, a novel framework that predicts credential stuffing
risks across websites. We introduce the concept of password reuse relations --
defined as the likelihood of users reusing passwords between websites -- and
represent them as edges in a website graph. Using graph neural networks (GNNs),
we perform a link prediction task to assess credential reuse risk between
sites. Our approach scales to a large number of arbitrary websites by
incorporating public website information and linking newly observed websites as
nodes in the graph. To preserve user privacy, we extend PassREfinder-FL with a
federated learning (FL) approach that eliminates the need to share user
sensitive information across administrators. Evaluation on a real-world dataset
of 360 million breached accounts from 22,378 websites shows that
PassREfinder-FL achieves an F1-score of 0.9153 in the FL setting. We further
validate that our FL-based GNN achieves a 4-11% performance improvement over
other state-of-the-art GNN models through an ablation study. Finally, we
demonstrate that the predicted results can be used to quantify password reuse
likelihood as actionable risk scores.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 反向传播算法在物理神经网络中难以实现，平衡传播(EP)作为替代方案具有相当的效率和原位训练潜力，但需要扩展到更广泛的物理系统。

Method: 扩展EP学习到离散和连续复值波系统，在弱耗散机制下有效，用可训练的局部势能替代节点间连接，在激子极化激元凝聚体中测试。

Result: 数值研究显示在逻辑任务和手写数字识别等标准基准测试中稳定收敛，证明了在系统控制仅限于局部参数时的原位学习可行性。

Conclusion: 为物理系统中原位学习建立了实用路径，特别是在系统控制仅限于局部参数的情况下。

Abstract: Backpropagation learning algorithm, the workhorse of modern artificial
intelligence, is notoriously difficult to implement in physical neural
networks. Equilibrium Propagation (EP) is an alternative with comparable
efficiency and strong potential for in-situ training. We extend EP learning to
both discrete and continuous complex-valued wave systems. In contrast to
previous EP implementations, our scheme is valid in the weakly dissipative
regime, and readily applicable to a wide range of physical settings, even
without well defined nodes, where trainable inter-node connections can be
replaced by trainable local potential. We test the method in driven-dissipative
exciton-polariton condensates governed by generalized Gross-Pitaevskii
dynamics. Numerical studies on standard benchmarks, including a simple logical
task and handwritten-digit recognition, demonstrate stable convergence,
establishing a practical route to in-situ learning in physical systems in which
system control is restricted to local parameters.

Conclusion: FSRF框架能有效缓解多模态情感分析中的模态缺失问题，提高模型在现实应用中的泛化能力

Abstract: In recent years, Multimodal Sentiment Analysis (MSA) has become a research
hotspot that aims to utilize multimodal data for human sentiment understanding.
Previous MSA studies have mainly focused on performing interaction and fusion
on complete multimodal data, ignoring the problem of missing modalities in
real-world applications due to occlusion, personal privacy constraints, and
device malfunctions, resulting in low generalizability.
  To this end, we propose a Factorization-guided Semantic Recovery Framework
(FSRF) to mitigate the modality missing problem in the MSA task.
  Specifically, we propose a de-redundant homo-heterogeneous factorization
module that factorizes modality into modality-homogeneous,
modality-heterogeneous, and noisy representations and design elaborate
constraint paradigms for representation learning.
  Furthermore, we design a distribution-aligned self-distillation module that
fully recovers the missing semantics by utilizing bidirectional knowledge
transfer.
  Comprehensive experiments on two datasets indicate that FSRF has a
significant performance advantage over previous methods with uncertain missing
modalities.

Motivation: 大型语言模型需要持续适应机制，但顺序更新会导致灾难性遗忘，新编辑会降低先前获得的知识。

Result: 在Qwen-2.5-7B模型上的实验表明，门控机制有效缓解遗忘同时保持适应性，基于EM的门控在短持续学习序列中实现最高累积性能。

Conclusion: 不同门控策略可实现相当的分布偏移但产生不同的准确性结果，突显了门控设计在持续适应中的重要性，为持续模型编辑提供了原则性方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) increasingly require mechanisms for continual
adaptation without full retraining. However, sequential updates can lead to
catastrophic forgetting, where new edits degrade previously acquired knowledge.
This work presents STABLE, a gated continual self editing framework that
constrains forgetting during sequential updates using parameter efficient fine
tuning via Low Rank Adaptation (LoRA; see arXiv:2106.09685). Each candidate
edit is evaluated against a stability budget using one of three metrics: (i)
Exact Match (EM) drop, capturing factual accuracy loss; (ii) bits increase,
reflecting reduced model confidence; and (iii) KL divergence, quantifying
distributional drift between the base and adapted models. If a threshold is
exceeded, the LoRA update is rescaled through a clipping procedure or rejected.
Experiments on the Qwen-2.5-7B model show that gating effectively mitigates
forgetting while preserving adaptability. EM based gating achieved the highest
cumulative performance in short continual learning sequences. Our results show
that different gating strategies can achieve comparable distribution shift
(measured by KL divergence) while producing different accuracy outcomes,
highlighting the importance of gating design in continual adaptation. This
approach offers a principled method for continual model editing, enabling LLMs
to integrate new knowledge while maintaining reliability. Code:

Conclusion: 分层压缩是提升多示例上下文学习效率的有效方法，需要更强的压缩器模型和分层压缩策略来保持性能。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been shown to be able to learn different
tasks without explicit finetuning when given many input-output examples /
demonstrations through In-Context Learning (ICL). Increasing the number of
examples, called ``shots'', improves downstream task performance but incurs
higher memory and computational costs. In this work, we study an approach to
improve the memory and computational efficiency of ICL inference by compressing
the many-shot prompts. Given many shots comprising t tokens, our goal is to
generate a m soft-token summary, where m < t. We first show that existing
prompt compression methods are ineffective for many-shot compression, and
simply using fewer shots as a baseline is surprisingly strong. To achieve
effective compression, we find that: (a) a stronger compressor model with more
trainable parameters is necessary, and (b) compressing many-shot
representations at each transformer layer enables more fine-grained compression
by providing each layer with its own compressed representation. Based on these
insights, we propose MemCom, a layer-wise compression method. We systematically
evaluate various compressor models and training approaches across different
model sizes (2B and 7B), architectures (Gemma and Mistral), many-shot sequence
lengths (3k-6k tokens), and compression ratios (3x to 8x). MemCom outperforms
strong baselines across all compression ratios on multiple classification tasks
with large label sets. Notably, while baseline performance degrades sharply at
higher compression ratios, often by over 20-30%, MemCom maintains high accuracy
with minimal degradation, typically dropping by less than 10%.

Abstract: World Models have vastly permeated the field of Reinforcement Learning. Their
ability to model the transition dynamics of an environment have greatly
improved sample efficiency in online RL. Among them, the most notorious example
is Dreamer, a model that learns to act in a diverse set of image-based
environments. In this paper, we leverage similarity search and stochastic
representations to approximate a world model without a training procedure. We
establish a comparison with PlaNet, a well-established world model of the
Dreamer family. We evaluate the models on the quality of latent reconstruction
and on the perceived similarity of the reconstructed image, on both next-step
and long horizon dynamics prediction. The results of our study demonstrate that
a search-based world model is comparable to a training based one in both cases.
Notably, our model show stronger performance in long-horizon prediction with
respect to the baseline on a range of visually different environments.

TL;DR: 首次对时变学习策略下的Q-learning算法进行了有限时间分析，在最小假设下建立了收敛速率，揭示了on-policy Q-learning相比off-policy的探索劣势和利用优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的Q-learning分析大多假设固定的行为策略（off-policy），而对时变学习策略（on-policy）的分析较少，特别是在最小探索假设下的有限时间分析仍是一个挑战。

Method: 采用改进的分析方法，利用泊松方程将马尔可夫噪声分解为鞅差项和残差项，并通过敏感性分析控制时变策略下的残差项。

Result: 建立了on-policy Q-learning的最终迭代收敛速率，样本复杂度为O(1/ε²)，与off-policy Q-learning相同但在探索参数上依赖更差。同时推导了学习策略收敛到最优策略的显式速率。

Conclusion: on-policy Q-learning具有较弱的探索性但享有利用优势，其策略会收敛到最优策略。所开发的分析工具可推广到其他具有快速时变学习策略的强化学习算法。

Abstract: In this work, we present the first finite-time analysis of the Q-learning
algorithm under time-varying learning policies (i.e., on-policy sampling) with
minimal assumptions -- specifically, assuming only the existence of a policy
that induces an irreducible Markov chain over the state space. We establish a
last-iterate convergence rate for $\mathbb{E}[\|Q_k - Q^*\|_\infty^2]$,
implying a sample complexity of order $O(1/\epsilon^2)$ for achieving
$\mathbb{E}[\|Q_k - Q^*\|_\infty] \le \epsilon$, matching that of off-policy
Q-learning but with a worse dependence on exploration-related parameters. We
also derive an explicit rate for $\mathbb{E}[\|Q^{\pi_k} - Q^*\|_\infty^2]$,
where $\pi_k$ is the learning policy at iteration $k$. These results reveal
that on-policy Q-learning exhibits weaker exploration than its off-policy
counterpart but enjoys an exploitation advantage, as its policy converges to an
optimal one rather than remaining fixed. Numerical simulations corroborate our
theory.
  Technically, the combination of time-varying learning policies (which induce
rapidly time-inhomogeneous Markovian noise) and the minimal assumption on
exploration presents significant analytical challenges. To address these
challenges, we employ a refined approach that leverages the Poisson equation to
decompose the Markovian noise corresponding to the lazy transition matrix into
a martingale-difference term and residual terms. To control the residual terms
under time inhomogeneity, we perform a sensitivity analysis of the Poisson
equation solution with respect to both the Q-function estimate and the learning
policy. These tools may further facilitate the analysis of general
reinforcement learning algorithms with rapidly time-varying learning policies
-- such as single-timescale actor--critic methods and learning-in-games
algorithms -- and are of independent interest.

Motivation: 现有稀疏专家混合模型(SMoE)的专家合并策略缺乏原则性的权重机制，通常依赖输入相关或输入无关的参数平均方法。

Method: 提出NAMEx框架，将纳什讨价还价理论融入专家合并过程，并引入复动量来加速专家传播，具有理论收敛保证。

Result: 在语言建模、文本分类、图像分类和数据损坏下的零样本鲁棒性等任务上，NAMEx始终优于竞争方法，并能无缝集成到流行的MoE架构中。

Conclusion: NAMEx在大规模系统(Qwen1.5-MoE 14B和DeepSeek-MoE 16B)中展现出良好的可扩展性，在零样本和微调设置下均有效。

Abstract: Existing expert merging strategies for Sparse Mixture of Experts (SMoE)
typically rely on input-dependent or input-independent averaging of expert
parameters, but often lack a principled weighting mechanism. In this work, we
reinterpret expert merging through the lens of game theory, revealing
cooperative and competitive dynamics among experts. Based on this perspective,
we introduce Nash Merging of Experts (NAMEx), a novel framework that
incorporates Nash Bargaining into the merging process, enabling more balanced
and efficient collaboration among experts. Additionally, we incorporate complex
momentum into NAMEx to accelerate expert propagation with theoretical
guarantees for convergence. Extensive experiments across language modelling,
text classification, image classification, and zero-shot robustness under data
corruption show that NAMEx consistently outperforms competing methods while
integrating seamlessly with popular MoE architectures. Finally, we demonstrate
NAMEx's scalability by applying it to large-scale systems, including
Qwen1.5-MoE (14B) and DeepSeek-MoE (16B), where it proves effective in both
zero-shot and fine-tuning settings.

*Xuchen Gong,Tian Li*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种连接零阶优化和锐度感知最小化(SAM)的新方法，通过指数倾斜目标在平均损失和最大损失之间平滑过渡，实现了更好的泛化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统零阶优化方法优化平滑后的目标函数，而SAM方法关注邻域内最大损失以获得平坦最小值。本文旨在明确连接这两种方法，提供统一的优化框架。

Method: 提出基于指数倾斜目标的软SAM方法，通过倾斜参数t在平均损失和最大损失之间平滑过渡。开发了新的零阶算法来求解该目标，并精确刻画了倾斜SAM框架的锐度概念。

Result: 该方法作为SAM变体的无梯度和内存高效替代方案，在分类、多项选择题回答和语言生成等下游任务上比传统零阶基线方法获得更好的泛化性能。

Conclusion: 提出的倾斜SAM框架成功连接了零阶优化和SAM方法，提供了一种灵活且有效的优化策略，在多种任务上展现出优越的泛化能力。

Abstract: Classic zeroth-order optimization approaches typically optimize for a
smoothed version of the original function, i.e., the expected objective under
randomly perturbed model parameters. This can be interpreted as encouraging the
loss values in the perturbation set to be small on average. Popular
sharpness-aware minimization (SAM) objectives, however, typically focus on the
largest loss within the neighborhood to arrive at flat minima more effectively.
In this work, we connect zeroth-order optimization (and its corresponding
objectives) with SAM approaches explicitly, through an exponential tilting
objective that provides a smooth transition between the average- and the
max-loss formulations. We explore new zeroth-order algorithms to solve a soft
SAM objective parameterized by a tilting parameter $t$. We provide precise
characterizations of the sharpness notions of the tilted SAM framework.
Practically, our approach can be used as a gradient-free and memory-efficient
alternative to SAM variants, and it achieves better generalization compared to
vanilla zeroth-order baselines on a wide range of downstream tasks, including
classification, multiple choice QA, and language generation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: GRUwE是一种基于GRU的模型，使用指数基函数处理不规则采样的多元时间序列，在连续时间中支持回归和事件预测，通过两种重置机制实现状态更新，性能优于现有方法且计算效率高。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决不规则采样时间序列建模的挑战，验证简单高效的RNN架构是否仍能与复杂方法竞争，提供易于实现且计算开销小的解决方案。

Method: 基于GRU架构，引入指数基函数，通过观察触发重置和时间触发重置两种机制更新马尔可夫状态，支持连续时间预测。

Result: 在多个真实世界基准测试中，GRUwE在下一观测和下一事件预测任务上达到或优于当前最先进方法的性能。

Conclusion: GRUwE证明了简单RNN架构的竞争力，具有易于实现、超参数调优少、计算开销低等优势，适合在线部署。

Abstract: Modeling irregularly sampled multivariate time series is a persistent
challenge in domains like healthcare and sensor networks. While recent works
have explored a variety of complex learning architectures to solve the
prediction problems for irregularly sampled time series, it remains unclear
what are the true benefits of some of these architectures, and whether clever
modifications of simpler and more efficient RNN-based algorithms are still
competitive, i.e. they are on par with or even superior to these methods. In
this work, we propose and study GRUwE: Gated Recurrent Unit with Exponential
basis functions, that builds upon RNN-based architectures for observations made
at irregular times. GRUwE supports both regression-based and event-based
predictions in continuous time. GRUwE works by maintaining a Markov state
representation of the time series that updates with the arrival of irregular
observations. The Markov state update relies on two reset mechanisms: (i)
observation-triggered reset, and (ii) time-triggered reset of the GRU state
using learnable exponential decays, to support the predictions in continuous
time. Our empirical evaluations across several real-world benchmarks on
next-observation and next-event prediction tasks demonstrate that GRUwE can
indeed achieve competitive to superior performance compared to the recent
state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. Thanks to its simplicity, GRUwE offers
compelling advantages: it is easy to implement, requires minimal
hyper-parameter tuning efforts, and significantly reduces the computational
overhead in the online deployment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管生成模型在材料发现中日益重要，但缺乏对其性能的严格比较评估。

Method: 使用三种代表性生成模型在超导数据集上训练，通过KL散度和平均绝对误差评估性能。

Result: CDVAE在KL散度和MAE指标上表现最优，AtomGPT次之，FlowMM最差。

Conclusion: CDVAE是三种模型中性能最好的生成模型，所有基准代码和配置将公开提供。

Abstract: Generative models have become significant assets in the exploration and
identification of new materials, enabling the rapid proposal of candidate
crystal structures that satisfy target properties. Despite the increasing
adoption of diverse architectures, a rigorous comparative evaluation of their
performance on materials datasets is lacking. In this work, we present a
systematic benchmark of three representative generative models- AtomGPT (a
transformer-based model), Crystal Diffusion Variational Autoencoder (CDVAE),
and FlowMM (a Riemannian flow matching model). These models were trained to
reconstruct crystal structures from subsets of two publicly available
superconductivity datasets- JARVIS Supercon 3D and DS A/B from the Alexandria
database. Performance was assessed using the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence
between predicted and reference distributions of lattice parameters, as well as
the mean absolute error (MAE) of individual lattice constants. For the computed
KLD and MAE scores, CDVAE performs most favorably, followed by AtomGPT, and
then FlowMM. All benchmarking code and model configurations will be made
publicly available at https://github.com/atomgptlab/atombench_inverse.

### [287] [Alignment is Localized: A Causal Probe into Preference Layers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16167)
*Archie Chaudhury*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 通过层间因果修补分析语言模型对齐机制，发现对齐是空间局部化的：中层激活编码了决定奖励一致行为的独特子空间，而早期和晚期层基本不受影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然基于人类反馈的强化学习（RLHF）已成为语言模型对齐的流行方法，但其内部工作机制仍然不透明，需要系统性分析对齐是如何实现的。

Method: 在基模型和调优模型之间应用层间因果修补，分析人类偏好对中的激活差异，并使用LASSO回归识别关键层。

Result: 对齐是空间局部化的，仅少数层具有将激活距离与奖励增益联系的非零系数，表明对齐是定向、低秩过程而非扩散参数过程。

Conclusion: 基于人类偏好的语言模型对齐是一个定向、低秩的过程，主要通过中层激活实现，而非在整个模型中扩散的参数变化。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning frameworks, particularly those utilizing human
annotations, have become an increasingly popular method for preference
fine-tuning, where the outputs of a language model are tuned to match a certain
set of behavioral policies or guidelines. Reinforcement Learning through Human
Feedback (RLHF) is perhaps the most popular implementation of such a framework,
particularly for aligning LMs toward safety and human intent. However, the
internal workings of how such alignment is achieved remain largely opaque. In
this work, we systematically analyze preference optimization for language model
alignment by applying layer-wide causal patching between a base model and its
tuned counterpart across human preference pairs. We implement our methodology
on \textit{Llama-3.2-1B}, and find that alignment is spatially localized:
mid-layer activations encode a distinct subspace that causally determines
reward-consistent behavior, while early and late layers remain largely
unaffected. Utilizing LASSO regression, we also find that only a small number
of layers possess non-zero coefficients linking activation distances to reward
gains. Overall, we show that, at least for some language models, alignment from
human-based, preferential tuning is a directional, low rank process, rather
than diffuse and parameteric.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出通过嵌入群等变卷积层（旋转和尺度等变）到标准CNN中来提升对抗鲁棒性，无需对抗训练即可在多种攻击下提高模型鲁棒性和泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 对抗训练作为主要防御策略存在计算成本高且可能损害干净数据准确性的问题，需要探索更高效的架构方法来提升对抗鲁棒性。

Method: 提出两种对称感知架构：并行设计（独立处理标准和等变特征后融合）和级联设计（顺序应用等变操作），嵌入旋转和尺度等变卷积层到标准CNN中。

Result: 在CIFAR-10、CIFAR-100和CIFAR-10C数据集上，模型在FGSM和PGD攻击下均能持续提高对抗鲁棒性和泛化能力，且无需对抗训练。

Conclusion: 对称强制架构可作为基于数据增强防御的高效且原则性替代方案，通过编码对称先验来提升模型鲁棒性。

Abstract: Adversarial examples reveal critical vulnerabilities in deep neural networks
by exploiting their sensitivity to imperceptible input perturbations. While
adversarial training remains the predominant defense strategy, it often incurs
significant computational cost and may compromise clean-data accuracy. In this
work, we investigate an architectural approach to adversarial robustness by
embedding group-equivariant convolutions-specifically, rotation- and
scale-equivariant layers-into standard convolutional neural networks (CNNs).
These layers encode symmetry priors that align model behavior with structured
transformations in the input space, promoting smoother decision boundaries and
greater resilience to adversarial attacks. We propose and evaluate two
symmetry-aware architectures: a parallel design that processes standard and
equivariant features independently before fusion, and a cascaded design that
applies equivariant operations sequentially. Theoretically, we demonstrate that
such models reduce hypothesis space complexity, regularize gradients, and yield
tighter certified robustness bounds under the CLEVER (Cross Lipschitz Extreme
Value for nEtwork Robustness) framework. Empirically, our models consistently
improve adversarial robustness and generalization across CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100,
and CIFAR-10C under both FGSM and PGD attacks, without requiring adversarial
training. These findings underscore the potential of symmetry-enforcing
architectures as efficient and principled alternatives to data
augmentation-based defenses.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前强化学习研究过度关注性能展示而忽视学习动态理解，这可能导致在学术基准上过拟合，难以将技术迁移到新问题。

Method: 以Arcade Learning Environment (ALE)为例，说明即使被认为是"饱和"的基准，仍可用于发展对强化学习的理解。

Result: 论证了重新定位强化学习研究方向的重要性，强调需要更多关注科学理解和基准测试的精确映射。

Conclusion: 强化学习研究应停止仅关注性能演示，而应更多关注推进强化学习的科学理解，并需要更精确地定义基准测试与数学形式化之间的关系。

Abstract: The last decade has seen an upswing in interest and adoption of reinforcement
learning (RL) techniques, in large part due to its demonstrated capabilities at
performing certain tasks at "super-human levels". This has incentivized the
community to prioritize research that demonstrates RL agent performance, often
at the expense of research aimed at understanding their learning dynamics.
Performance-focused research runs the risk of overfitting on academic
benchmarks -- thereby rendering them less useful -- which can make it difficult
to transfer proposed techniques to novel problems. Further, it implicitly
diminishes work that does not push the performance-frontier, but aims at
improving our understanding of these techniques. This paper argues two points:
(i) RL research should stop focusing solely on demonstrating agent
capabilities, and focus more on advancing the science and understanding of
reinforcement learning; and (ii) we need to be more precise on how our
benchmarks map to the underlying mathematical formalisms. We use the popular
Arcade Learning Environment (ALE; Bellemare et al., 2013) as an example of a
benchmark that, despite being increasingly considered "saturated", can be
effectively used for developing this understanding, and facilitating the
deployment of RL techniques in impactful real-world problems.

*Daniel Donnelly,Angelo Ferrando,Francesco Belardinelli*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于运行时监控语言(RML)的新型语言奖励机，能够表达非正则、非马尔可夫任务，解决了传统奖励机表达能力有限的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 强化学习中奖励函数通常被视为黑盒映射，缺乏解释性。传统奖励机虽然能表示结构化奖励函数，但表达能力受限于正则语言，无法处理计数或参数化条件等复杂行为。

Method: 基于运行时监控语言(RML)构建语言奖励机，利用RML的内置内存机制来指定非正则、非马尔可夫任务的奖励函数。

Result: 实验证明了该方法在表达能力上的优势，在事件处理和任务规范方面比现有奖励机方法更具灵活性。

Conclusion: 语言奖励机扩展了奖励函数的表达能力，能够处理更复杂的非正则行为，为强化学习提供了更强大的任务规范工具。

Abstract: A key challenge in reinforcement learning (RL) is reward (mis)specification,
whereby imprecisely defined reward functions can result in unintended, possibly
harmful, behaviours. Indeed, reward functions in RL are typically treated as
black-box mappings from state-action pairs to scalar values. While effective in
many settings, this approach provides no information about why rewards are
given, which can hinder learning and interpretability. Reward Machines address
this issue by representing reward functions as finite state automata, enabling
the specification of structured, non-Markovian reward functions. However, their
expressivity is typically bounded by regular languages, leaving them unable to
capture more complex behaviours such as counting or parametrised conditions. In
this work, we build on the Runtime Monitoring Language (RML) to develop a novel
class of language-based Reward Machines. By leveraging the built-in memory of
RML, our approach can specify reward functions for non-regular, non-Markovian
tasks. We demonstrate the expressiveness of our approach through experiments,
highlighting additional advantages in flexible event-handling and task
specification over existing Reward Machine-based methods.

Result: 实证评估表明所提方法具有有效性和高效性。

Conclusion: 该框架成功解决了传统强化学习和关系强化学习的局限性，在结构化问题处理上表现出色。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has experienced a second wind in the past decade.
While incredibly successful in images and videos, these systems still operate
within the realm of propositional tasks ignoring the inherent structure that
exists in the problem. Consequently, relational extensions (RRL) have been
developed for such structured problems that allow for effective generalization
to arbitrary number of objects. However, they inherently make strong
assumptions about the problem structure. We introduce a novel framework that
combines RRL with object-centric representation to handle both structured and
unstructured data. We enhance learning by allowing the system to actively query
the human expert for guidance by explicitly modeling the uncertainty over the
policy. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness and efficiency
of our proposed approach.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究非平稳多臂老虎机问题，其中奖励同时依赖于动作和潜在状态，且状态动态受动作影响，这导致了短期奖励和长期奖励之间的权衡问题。

Method: 提出探索-承诺算法：探索阶段使用随机Rademacher动作估计线性动态的马尔可夫参数；承诺阶段使用估计参数设计优化的动作序列以实现长期奖励最大化。

Result: 算法实现了$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(T^{2/3})$的遗憾界，提供了系统识别的样本复杂度和误差界，并证明了与超立方体上不定二次优化的等价性。

Conclusion: 成功解决了从时间相关奖励中学习和设计具有最优长期奖励的动作序列两个关键挑战，提出了实用的半定松弛和Goemans-Williamson舍入方法。

Abstract: We study a nonstationary bandit problem where rewards depend on both actions
and latent states, the latter governed by unknown linear dynamics. Crucially,
the state dynamics also depend on the actions, resulting in tension between
short-term and long-term rewards. We propose an explore-then-commit algorithm
for a finite horizon $T$. During the exploration phase, random Rademacher
actions enable estimation of the Markov parameters of the linear dynamics,
which characterize the action-reward relationship. In the commit phase, the
algorithm uses the estimated parameters to design an optimized action sequence
for long-term reward. Our proposed algorithm achieves
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(T^{2/3})$ regret. Our analysis handles two key challenges:
learning from temporally correlated rewards, and designing action sequences
with optimal long-term reward. We address the first challenge by providing
near-optimal sample complexity and error bounds for system identification using
bilinear rewards. We address the second challenge by proving an equivalence
with indefinite quadratic optimization over a hypercube, a known NP-hard
problem. We provide a sub-optimality guarantee for this problem, enabling our
regret upper bound. Lastly, we propose a semidefinite relaxation with
Goemans-Williamson rounding as a practical approach.

Motivation: 现实世界数据集中普遍存在标签噪声问题，影响模型训练和验证。虽然已有多种检测方法，但缺乏明确的共识和系统比较。

Method: 将检测方法分解为三个基本组件：标签一致性函数、聚合方法和信息收集方式（样本内vs样本外），并提出了统一的基准任务和新的评估指标。

Result: 在视觉和表格数据集上的评估表明，使用logit边界作为标签一致性函数、平均概率聚合和样本内信息收集的组合在大多数场景下表现最佳。

Conclusion: 研究结果为设计新的检测方法和为特定应用选择技术提供了实用指导。

Abstract: Label noise is a common problem in real-world datasets, affecting both model
training and validation. Clean data are essential for achieving strong
performance and ensuring reliable evaluation. While various techniques have
been proposed to detect noisy labels, there is no clear consensus on optimal
approaches. We perform a comprehensive benchmark of detection methods by
decomposing them into three fundamental components: label agreement function,
aggregation method, and information gathering approach (in-sample vs
out-of-sample). This decomposition can be applied to many existing detection
methods, and enables systematic comparison across diverse approaches. To fairly
compare methods, we propose a unified benchmark task, detecting a fraction of
training samples equal to the dataset's noise rate. We also introduce a novel
metric: the false negative rate at this fixed operating point. Our evaluation
spans vision and tabular datasets under both synthetic and real-world noise
conditions. We identify that in-sample information gathering using average
probability aggregation combined with the logit margin as the label agreement
function achieves the best results across most scenarios. Our findings provide
practical guidance for designing new detection methods and selecting techniques
for specific applications.

Abstract: Climate change demands effective legislative action to mitigate its impacts.
This study explores the application of machine learning (ML) to understand the
progression of climate policy from announcement to adoption, focusing on

incorporating text and metadata. We aim to predict a policy's progression
status, and compare text representation methods, including TF-IDF, BERT, and
ClimateBERT. Metadata features are included to evaluate the impact on
predictive performance. On text features alone, ClimateBERT outperforms other
approaches (RMSE = 0.17, R^2 = 0.29), while BERT achieves superior performance
with the addition of metadata features (RMSE = 0.16, R^2 = 0.38). Using methods
from explainable AI highlights the influence of factors such as policy wording
and metadata including political party and country representation. These
findings underscore the potential of ML tools in supporting climate policy

Conclusion: 该研究为一比特神经网络压缩提供了理论支持，证明在随机特征模型中这种压缩方法是可行的，且能带来实际的性能提升。

Abstract: Recent advances in neural networks have led to significant computational and
memory demands, spurring interest in one-bit weight compression to enable
efficient inference on resource-constrained devices. However, the theoretical
underpinnings of such compression remain poorly understood. We address this gap
by analyzing one-bit quantization in the Random Features model, a simplified
framework that corresponds to neural networks with random representations. We
prove that, asymptotically, quantizing weights of all layers except the last
incurs no loss in generalization error, compared to the full precision random
features model. Our findings offer theoretical insights into neural network
compression. We also demonstrate empirically that one-bit quantization leads to
significant inference speed ups for the Random Features models even on a laptop
GPU, confirming the practical benefits of our work. Additionally, we provide an
asymptotically precise characterization of the generalization error for Random
Features with an arbitrary number of layers. To the best of our knowledge, our
analysis yields more general results than all previous works in the related
literature.

Conclusion: WEBSERV提供了一个高效、可扩展的强化学习Web代理训练和评估环境，显著提升了性能并降低了资源需求。

Abstract: Training and evaluation of Reinforcement Learning (RL) web agents have gained
increasing attention, yet a scalable and efficient environment that couples
realistic and robust browser-side interaction with controllable server-side
state at scale is still missing. Existing environments tend to have one or more
of the following issues: they overwhelm policy models with excessive and noisy
context; they perform actions non-deterministically without waiting for the UI
or network to stabilize; or they cannot scale isolated client-server containers
effectively for parallel RL rollouts. We propose WEBSERV, an environment that
includes 1) a compact, site-agnostic browser environment that balances context
and action complexity, and 2) a scalable RL environment via efficient launching
and resetting web-servers to enable scalable RL training and evaluation. We
evaluate WEBSERV on the shopping CMS and Gitlab tasks in WebArena, achieving
state-of-the-art single-prompt success rates while cutting launch latency by
~5x and storage need by ~240x, with a comparable memory footprint, enabling
200+ concurrent containers on a single host.

Motivation: AlphaFold等蛋白质结构预测模型中的Evoformer架构深度大（48个块），计算成本高且层间离散化，需要更高效的替代方案

Method: 使用神经常微分方程（Neural ODEs）将Evoformer的离散块替换为连续时间参数化，保留核心注意力操作，利用伴随方法实现恒定内存成本

Abstract: Recent advances in protein structure prediction, such as AlphaFold, have
demonstrated the power of deep neural architectures like the Evoformer for
capturing complex spatial and evolutionary constraints on protein conformation.
However, the depth of the Evoformer, comprising 48 stacked blocks, introduces
high computational costs and rigid layerwise discretization. Inspired by Neural
Ordinary Differential Equations (Neural ODEs), we propose a continuous-depth
formulation of the Evoformer, replacing its 48 discrete blocks with a Neural
ODE parameterization that preserves its core attention-based operations. This
continuous-time Evoformer achieves constant memory cost (in depth) via the
adjoint method, while allowing a principled trade-off between runtime and
accuracy through adaptive ODE solvers. Benchmarking on protein structure
prediction tasks, we find that the Neural ODE-based Evoformer produces
structurally plausible predictions and reliably captures certain secondary
structure elements, such as alpha-helices, though it does not fully replicate
the accuracy of the original architecture. However, our model achieves this
performance using dramatically fewer resources, just 17.5 hours of training on
a single GPU, highlighting the promise of continuous-depth models as a
lightweight and interpretable alternative for biomolecular modeling. This work
opens new directions for efficient and adaptive protein structure prediction
frameworks.

TL;DR: 该论文从范畴论角度分析超边解缠，提出了基于自然性条件的解缠准则，并在基因通路数据上验证了其有效性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管解缠表示学习在图结构数据中已取得良好效果，但很少有研究探索超图结构数据的解缠。将超边解缠整合到超图神经网络中，可以利用隐藏的超边语义（如节点间未标注的关系）来提升模型性能。

Method: 从范畴论视角分析超边解缠，提出基于自然性条件的新解缠准则，并构建概念验证模型。

Result: 实验表明，所提出的准则能够成功捕捉基因通路中基因（节点）之间的功能关系。

Conclusion: 该研究证明了所提出的解缠准则在超图数据中的潜力，特别是在生物信息学领域的应用价值。

Abstract: Despite the promising results of disentangled representation learning in
discovering latent patterns in graph-structured data, few studies have explored
disentanglement for hypergraph-structured data. Integrating hyperedge
disentanglement into hypergraph neural networks enables models to leverage
hidden hyperedge semantics, such as unannotated relations between nodes, that
are associated with labels. This paper presents an analysis of hyperedge
disentanglement from a category-theoretical perspective and proposes a novel
criterion for disentanglement derived from the naturality condition. Our
proof-of-concept model experimentally showed the potential of the proposed
criterion by successfully capturing functional relations of genes (nodes) in
genetic pathways (hyperedges).

TL;DR: 提出一种结合SVD和量化的方法，通过动态调整SVD秩来减少KV缓存大小和计算开销，在保持精度的同时显著降低内存使用和计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型(VLMs)在图像描述和视觉问答等任务中应用广泛，但其高计算成本和内存占用限制了可扩展性和实时应用。

Method: 利用奇异值分解(SVD)对联合QKV权重矩阵进行处理以减少KV缓存大小，并引入动态SVD秩分配策略，同时结合VLM权重和激活的量化。

Result: 相比仅使用量化或SVD的方法，在消耗更少硬件成本的同时实现了超过10%的准确率提升。

Conclusion: 该方法更适合在资源受限设备上进行实时部署，为高效VLM提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) are integral to tasks such as image captioning
and visual question answering, but their high computational cost, driven by
large memory footprints and processing time, limits their scalability and
real-time applicability. In this work, we propose leveraging Singular-Value
Decomposition (SVD) over the joint query (Q), key (K), and value (V) weight
matrices to reduce KV cache size and computational overhead. We in addition
introduce an efficient rank allocation strategy that dynamically adjusts the
SVD rank based on its impact on VLM accuracy, achieving a significant reduction
in both memory usage and computational cost. Finally, we extend this approach
by applying quantization to both VLM weights and activations, resulting in a
highly efficient VLM. Our method outperforms previous approaches that rely
solely on quantization or SVD by achieving more than $10\%$ accuracy
improvement while consuming less hardware cost, making it better for real-time
deployment on resource-constrained devices. We open source our code at

TL;DR: ScaffAug是一个基于支架的虚拟筛选框架，通过生成AI增强数据、自训练和重排序三个模块解决类不平衡、结构不平衡和结构多样性需求等挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虚拟筛选面临三个主要挑战：类不平衡（活性分子比例低）、活性分子间的结构不平衡（某些支架占主导）、以及需要识别结构多样的活性分子用于新药开发。

Method: 1. 增强模块：使用图扩散模型基于实际命中分子的支架生成合成数据；2. 模型无关的自训练模块：安全整合生成数据与原始标记数据；3. 重排序模块：提高推荐分子集的支架多样性，同时保持甚至提升整体性能。

Result: 在五个靶标类别上进行的计算实验表明，ScaffAug在多个评估指标上优于现有基线方法，并通过消融研究验证了其有效性。

Conclusion: 该工作通过利用生成增强、重排序和支架感知，为有效增强虚拟筛选提供了新的视角。

Abstract: Ligand-based virtual screening (VS) is an essential step in drug discovery
that evaluates large chemical libraries to identify compounds that potentially
bind to a therapeutic target. However, VS faces three major challenges: class
imbalance due to the low active rate, structural imbalance among active
molecules where certain scaffolds dominate, and the need to identify
structurally diverse active compounds for novel drug development. We introduce
ScaffAug, a scaffold-aware VS framework that addresses these challenges through
three modules. The augmentation module first generates synthetic data
conditioned on scaffolds of actual hits using generative AI, specifically a
graph diffusion model. This helps mitigate the class imbalance and furthermore
the structural imbalance, due to our proposed scaffold-aware sampling
algorithm, designed to produce more samples for active molecules with
underrepresented scaffolds. A model-agnostic self-training module is then used
to safely integrate the generated synthetic data from our augmentation module
with the original labeled data. Lastly, we introduce a reranking module that
improves VS by enhancing scaffold diversity in the top recommended set of
molecules, while still maintaining and even enhancing the overall general
performance of identifying novel, active compounds. We conduct comprehensive
computational experiments across five target classes, comparing ScaffAug
against existing baseline methods by reporting the performance of multiple
evaluation metrics and performing ablation studies on ScaffAug. Overall, this
work introduces novel perspectives on effectively enhancing VS by leveraging
generative augmentations, reranking, and general scaffold-awareness.

TL;DR: S2-DiGCL是一个针对有向图的对比学习框架，通过复数域和实数域两个互补的空间视角，结合磁拉普拉斯算子和路径子图增强策略，在有向图表示学习中实现了SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的图对比学习方法主要关注无向图，忽略了现实世界网络（如社交网络和推荐系统）中至关重要的方向性信息。

Method: 从复数域视角引入磁拉普拉斯算子进行个性化扰动来调节边相位和方向语义；从实数域视角采用基于路径的子图增强策略捕捉局部不对称性和拓扑依赖；联合利用这两个互补空间视图构建高质量正负样本。

Result: 在7个真实世界有向图数据集上的实验表明，该方法在节点分类和链接预测任务上分别实现了4.41%和4.34%的性能提升，在监督和无监督设置下均达到SOTA。

Conclusion: S2-DiGCL通过整合复数域和实数域的空间洞察，为有向图对比学习提供了一个通用且鲁棒的框架，显著提升了表示学习性能。

Abstract: Graph Contrastive Learning (GCL) has emerged as a powerful tool for
extracting consistent representations from graphs, independent of labeled
information. However, existing methods predominantly focus on undirected
graphs, disregarding the pivotal directional information that is fundamental
and indispensable in real-world networks (e.g., social networks and
recommendations).In this paper, we introduce S2-DiGCL, a novel framework that
emphasizes spatial insights from complex and real domain perspectives for
directed graph (digraph) contrastive learning. From the complex-domain
perspective, S2-DiGCL introduces personalized perturbations into the magnetic
Laplacian to adaptively modulate edge phases and directional semantics. From
the real-domain perspective, it employs a path-based subgraph augmentation
strategy to capture fine-grained local asymmetries and topological
dependencies. By jointly leveraging these two complementary spatial views,
S2-DiGCL constructs high-quality positive and negative samples, leading to more
general and robust digraph contrastive learning. Extensive experiments on 7
real-world digraph datasets demonstrate the superiority of our approach,
achieving SOTA performance with 4.41% improvement in node classification and
4.34% in link prediction under both supervised and unsupervised settings.

Motivation: 重新思考记忆化与泛化的关系，研究记忆化如何与组合能力协同工作来提升模型对罕见测试样本的预测能力。

Method: 理论分析线性设置下的记忆化与组合机制，并在神经网络架构上进行实验验证。

Result: 理论证明和实验结果表明，记忆化与组合能力结合可以使模型对训练数据中未出现的长尾特征组合做出正确预测，且模型的组合能力取决于其架构。

Conclusion: 记忆化与组合能力的协同作用是深度学习模型泛化能力的重要机制，特别是在处理长尾特征组合时具有关键作用。

Abstract: Deep learning has led researchers to rethink the relationship between
memorization and generalization. In many settings, memorization does not hurt
generalization due to implicit regularization and may help by memorizing
long-tailed examples. In this paper, we consider the synergy between
memorization and simple composition -- the ability to make correct prediction
on a combination of long-tailed features. Theoretically, we show that for a
linear setting, memorization together with composition can help the model make
correct predictions on rare test examples that require a combination of
long-tailed features, even if such combinations were never observed in the
training data. Experiments on neural network architecture on simple data show
that the theoretical insight extends beyond the linear setting, and we further
observe that the composition capability of the model depends on its
architecture.

Conclusion: 提出的方法验证了其优越性，通过细粒度特征提取、异构图融合和动态多尺度预测，有效提升了多模态时间序列预测的准确性。

Abstract: Recent research in time series forecasting has explored integrating
multimodal features into models to improve accuracy. However, the accuracy of
such methods is constrained by three key challenges: inadequate extraction of
fine-grained temporal patterns, suboptimal integration of multimodal
information, and limited adaptability to dynamic multi-scale features. To
address these problems, we propose MGTS-Net, a Multimodal Graph-enhanced
Network for Time Series forecasting. The model consists of three core
components: (1) a Multimodal Feature Extraction layer (MFE), which optimizes
feature encoders according to the characteristics of temporal, visual, and
textual modalities to extract temporal features of fine-grained patterns; (2) a
Multimodal Feature Fusion layer (MFF), which constructs a heterogeneous graph
to model intra-modal temporal dependencies and cross-modal alignment
relationships and dynamically aggregates multimodal knowledge; (3) a
Multi-Scale Prediction layer (MSP), which adapts to multi-scale features by
dynamically weighting and fusing the outputs of short-term, medium-term, and
long-term predictors. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MGTS-Net exhibits
excellent performance with light weight and high efficiency. Compared with
other state-of-the-art baseline models, our method achieves superior
performance, validating the superiority of the proposed methodology.

Motivation: 将数据分布的先验信息直接融入transformer架构，改进传统流模型的优化问题凸性并促进生成样本的稀疏性。

Method: 基于正则化Wasserstein近端算子设计稀疏transformer架构，该算子具有闭式解且表现为transformer的特殊表示形式。

Result: 理论分析和数值实验表明，在生成建模和贝叶斯逆问题应用中，稀疏transformer比基于神经ODE的传统方法具有更高精度和更快收敛速度。

Conclusion: 稀疏transformer架构通过融入先验信息，在生成建模和逆问题中优于传统方法，实现了更好的优化性能和稀疏性。

Abstract: In this work, we propose a sparse transformer architecture that incorporates
prior information about the underlying data distribution directly into the
transformer structure of the neural network. The design of the model is
motivated by a special optimal transport problem, namely the regularized
Wasserstein proximal operator, which admits a closed-form solution and turns
out to be a special representation of transformer architectures. Compared with
classical flow-based models, the proposed approach improves the convexity
properties of the optimization problem and promotes sparsity in the generated
samples. Through both theoretical analysis and numerical experiments, including
applications in generative modeling and Bayesian inverse problems, we
demonstrate that the sparse transformer achieves higher accuracy and faster
convergence to the target distribution than classical neural ODE-based methods.

Method: 提出SymphonySMoE，在SMoE基础上引入专家间的社交图来建模专家交互，改进令牌路由过程。该方法轻量级、模块化，可与现有SMoE模型无缝集成。

Conclusion: SymphonySMoE通过图结构增强专家交互，有效提升了SMoE在分布变化下的鲁棒性，同时保持了模型的可扩展性和效率。

Abstract: Sparse Mixture of Experts (SMoE) has emerged as a promising solution to
achieving unparalleled scalability in deep learning by decoupling model
parameter count from computational cost. By activating only a small subset of
parameters per sample, SMoE enables significant growth in model capacity while
maintaining efficiency. However, SMoE struggles to adapt to distributional
shifts, leading to reduced robustness under data contamination. In this work,
we introduce SymphonySMoE, a novel family of SMoE that introduces a social
graph to model interactions among experts. This graph-based structure enhances
the token routing process, addressing the robustness challenges that are
inherent in conventional SMoE designs. SymphonySMoE is lightweight, modular,
and integrates seamlessly with existing SMoE-based models such as the XMoE and
the Generalist Language Model. We provide both theoretical analysis and
empirical evidence demonstrating SymphonySMoE's advantages over baseline SMoE.
Extensive experiments on language modeling and visual instruction tuning
validate our method's effectiveness. We further highlight the scalability of
SymphonySMoE to models with 4.2 and 7.4 billion parameters, showcasing its
applicability in fine-tuning tasks for large-scale systems.

Conclusion: 提出的Input Domain Aware MoE框架通过改进路由机制，解决了稀疏专家混合模型中的专业化与平衡问题，在保持计算效率的同时提升了性能。

Abstract: Sparse Mixture of Experts (sMoE) has become a pivotal approach for scaling
large vision-language models, offering substantial capacity while maintaining
computational efficiency through dynamic, sparse activation of experts.
However, existing routing mechanisms, typically based on similarity scoring,
struggle to effectively capture the underlying input structure. This limitation
leads to a trade-off between expert specialization and balanced computation,
hindering both scalability and performance. We propose Input Domain Aware MoE,
a novel routing framework that leverages a probabilistic mixture model to
better partition the input space. By modeling routing probabilities as a
mixture of distributions, our method enables experts to develop clear
specialization boundaries while achieving balanced utilization. Unlike
conventional approaches, our routing mechanism is trained independently of
task-specific objectives, allowing for stable optimization and decisive expert
assignments. Empirical results on vision-language tasks demonstrate that our
method consistently outperforms existing sMoE approaches, achieving higher task
performance and improved expert utilization balance.

Abstract: We introduce a sequential reinforcement learning framework for imitation
learning designed to model heterogeneous cognitive strategies in pollinators.
Focusing on honeybees, our approach leverages trajectory similarity to capture
and forecast behavior across individuals that rely on distinct strategies: some
exploiting numerical cues, others drawing on memory, or being influenced by
environmental factors such as weather. Through empirical evaluation, we show
that state-of-the-art imitation learning methods often fail in this setting:
when expert policies shift across memory windows or deviate from optimality,
these models overlook both fast and slow learning behaviors and cannot
faithfully reproduce key decision patterns. Moreover, they offer limited
interpretability, hindering biological insight. Our contribution addresses
these challenges by (i) introducing a model that minimizes predictive loss
while identifying the effective memory horizon most consistent with behavioral
data, and (ii) ensuring full interpretability to enable biologists to analyze
underlying decision-making strategies and finally (iii) providing a
mathematical framework linking bee policy search with bandit formulations under
varying exploration-exploitation dynamics, and releasing a novel dataset of 80
tracked bees observed under diverse weather conditions. This benchmark
facilitates research on pollinator cognition and supports ecological governance
by improving simulations of insect behavior in agroecosystems. Our findings
shed new light on the learning strategies and memory interplay shaping
pollinator decision-making.

Motivation: 传统投影潜在结构(PLS)方法在处理高维异构数据时面临挑战，难以建模复杂的非线性关系和多变量系统中的高维相关结构，同时静态特征加权限制了上下文变化的适应性。

Method: 引入自适应核基注意力机制，分别处理不同的特征组然后进行整合，既能捕捉局部模式又能保持全局关系。

Result: 实验结果显示，与最先进方法相比，在多个数据集上性能指标有显著提升。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法通过新颖的架构创新有效解决了高维异构数据中的复杂特征交互问题，显著提高了预测性能。

Abstract: High-dimensional, heterogeneous data with complex feature interactions pose
significant challenges for traditional predictive modeling approaches. While
Projection to Latent Structures (PLS) remains a popular technique, it struggles
to model complex non-linear relationships, especially in multivariate systems
with high-dimensional correlation structures. This challenge is further
compounded by simultaneous interactions across multiple scales, where local
processing fails to capture crossgroup dependencies. Additionally, static
feature weighting limits adaptability to contextual variations, as it ignores
sample-specific relevance. To address these limitations, we propose a novel
method that enhances predictive performance through novel architectural
innovations. Our architecture introduces an adaptive kernel-based attention
mechanism that processes distinct feature groups separately before integration,
enabling capture of local patterns while preserving global relationships.
Experimental results show substantial improvements in performance metrics,
compared to the state-of-the-art methods across diverse datasets.

Conclusion: OracleAD不仅性能优越，而且通过稳定潜在结构保持可解释性，能够在嵌入级别直接定位根因变量。

Abstract: Real-world multivariate time series anomalies are rare and often unlabeled.
Additionally, prevailing methods rely on increasingly complex architectures
tuned to benchmarks, detecting only fragments of anomalous segments and
overstating performance. In this paper, we introduce OracleAD, a simple and
interpretable unsupervised framework for multivariate time series anomaly
detection. OracleAD encodes each variable's past sequence into a single causal
embedding to jointly predict the present time point and reconstruct the input
window, effectively modeling temporal dynamics. These embeddings then undergo a
self-attention mechanism to project them into a shared latent space and capture
spatial relationships. These relationships are not static, since they are
modeled by a property that emerges from each variable's temporal dynamics. The
projected embeddings are aligned to a Stable Latent Structure (SLS)
representing normal-state relationships. Anomalies are identified using a dual
scoring mechanism based on prediction error and deviation from the SLS,
enabling fine-grained anomaly diagnosis at each time point and across
individual variables. Since any noticeable SLS deviation originates from
embeddings that violate the learned temporal causality of normal data, OracleAD
directly pinpoints the root-cause variables at the embedding level. OracleAD
achieves state-of-the-art results across multiple real-world datasets and
evaluation protocols, while remaining interpretable through SLS.

Result: 在合成基准测试中与领先估计器表现相当，MAE值相近；在中等至高噪声水平和大数据集下，精确本征维度匹配率高达25.0%，优于MLE(16.7%)和TWO-NN(12.5%)；能够准确检测决策边界中的分形几何。

Conclusion: eDCF方法在噪声环境下具有优越性能，能够有效分析现实结构化数据的本征维度特性。

Abstract: Modern datasets often contain high-dimensional features exhibiting complex
dependencies. To effectively analyze such data, dimensionality reduction
methods rely on estimating the dataset's intrinsic dimension (id) as a measure
of its underlying complexity. However, estimating id is challenging due to its
dependence on scale: at very fine scales, noise inflates id estimates, while at
coarser scales, estimates stabilize to lower, scale-invariant values. This
paper introduces a novel, scalable, and parallelizable method called eDCF,
which is based on Connectivity Factor (CF), a local connectivity-based metric,
to robustly estimate intrinsic dimension across varying scales. Our method
consistently matches leading estimators, achieving comparable values of mean
absolute error (MAE) on synthetic benchmarks with noisy samples. Moreover, our
approach also attains higher exact intrinsic dimension match rates, reaching up
to 25.0% compared to 16.7% for MLE and 12.5% for TWO-NN, particularly excelling
under medium to high noise levels and large datasets. Further, we showcase our
method's ability to accurately detect fractal geometries in decision
boundaries, confirming its utility for analyzing realistic, structured data.

Conclusion: 呼吁社区采用基于科学的防泄漏基准，并投资于适合真实世界研究的混合因果发现方法，以实现LLMs在因果分析中的真正潜力。

Abstract: Recent claims of strong performance by Large Language Models (LLMs) on causal
discovery are undermined by a key flaw: many evaluations rely on benchmarks
likely included in pretraining corpora. Thus, apparent success suggests that
LLM-only methods, which ignore observational data, outperform classical
statistical approaches. We challenge this narrative by asking: Do LLMs truly
reason about causal structure, and how can we measure it without memorization
concerns? Can they be trusted for real-world scientific discovery? We argue
that realizing LLMs' potential for causal analysis requires two shifts: (P.1)
developing robust evaluation protocols based on recent scientific studies to
guard against dataset leakage, and (P.2) designing hybrid methods that combine
LLM-derived knowledge with data-driven statistics. To address P.1, we encourage
evaluating discovery methods on novel, real-world scientific studies. We
outline a practical recipe for extracting causal graphs from recent
publications released after an LLM's training cutoff, ensuring relevance and
preventing memorization while capturing both established and novel relations.
Compared to benchmarks like BNLearn, where LLMs achieve near-perfect accuracy,
they perform far worse on our curated graphs, underscoring the need for
statistical grounding. Supporting P.2, we show that using LLM predictions as
priors for the classical PC algorithm significantly improves accuracy over both
LLM-only and purely statistical methods. We call on the community to adopt
science-grounded, leakage-resistant benchmarks and invest in hybrid causal
discovery methods suited to real-world inquiry.

Conclusion: 机器学习、大型语言模型和可解释AI可以共同构建对AI研究人类行为的信任和理解，对量化和理解主观幸福感具有重要影响。

Abstract: Life satisfaction is a crucial facet of human well-being. Hence, research on
life satisfaction is incumbent for understanding how individuals experience
their lives and influencing interventions targeted at enhancing mental health
and well-being. Life satisfaction has traditionally been measured using analog,
complicated, and frequently error-prone methods. These methods raise questions
concerning validation and propagation. However, this study demonstrates the
potential for machine learning algorithms to predict life satisfaction with a
high accuracy of 93.80% and a 73.00% macro F1-score. The dataset comes from a
government survey of 19000 people aged 16-64 years in Denmark. Using feature
learning techniques, 27 significant questions for assessing contentment were
extracted, making the study highly reproducible, simple, and easily
interpretable. Furthermore, clinical and biomedical large language models
(LLMs) were explored for predicting life satisfaction by converting tabular
data into natural language sentences through mapping and adding meaningful
counterparts, achieving an accuracy of 93.74% and macro F1-score of 73.21%. It
was found that life satisfaction prediction is more closely related to the
biomedical domain than the clinical domain. Ablation studies were also
conducted to understand the impact of data resampling and feature selection
techniques on model performance. Moreover, the correlation between primary
determinants with different age brackets was analyzed, and it was found that
health condition is the most important determinant across all ages. This study
demonstrates how machine learning, large language models and XAI can jointly
contribute to building trust and understanding in using AI to investigate human
behavior, with significant ramifications for academics and professionals
working to quantify and comprehend subjective well-being.

Motivation: 随着EEG数据量的增加，建立基础模型来扩展和泛化神经解码变得重要，但由于被试间、任务间、条件间的巨大变异性以及不同电极配置，应用基础模型到EEG仍然具有挑战性。

Method: 1）时间上：引入幅度感知掩码预训练（AAMP），基于信号幅度而非随机间隔进行掩码；2）使用渐进专家混合（PMoE）架构，在深层逐步引入专门化专家子网络；3）空间上：利用电极3D物理坐标实现跨EEG设置的嵌入迁移；4）在微调期间开发脑内-脑间叶池化（IILP）来有效利用区域脑特征。

Conclusion: 这项工作推动了EEG中基础模型的发展，并为可扩展和可泛化的神经信息处理系统提供了见解。

Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) has wide-ranging applications, from clinical
diagnosis to brain-computer interfaces (BCIs). With the increasing volume and
variety of EEG data, there has been growing interest in establishing foundation
models (FMs) to scale up and generalize neural decoding. Despite showing early
potential, applying FMs to EEG remains challenging due to substantial
inter-subject, inter-task, and inter-condition variability, as well as diverse
electrode configurations across recording setups. To tackle these open
challenges, we propose NeurIPT, a foundation model developed for diverse
EEG-based Neural Interfaces with a Pre-trained Transformer by capturing both
homogeneous and heterogeneous spatio-temporal characteristics inherent in EEG
signals. Temporally, we introduce Amplitude-Aware Masked Pretraining (AAMP),
masking based on signal amplitude rather than random intervals, to learn robust
representations across varying signal intensities beyond local interpolation.
Moreover, this temporal representation is enhanced by a Progressive
Mixture-of-Experts (PMoE) architecture, where specialized expert subnetworks
are progressively introduced at deeper layers, adapting effectively to the
diverse temporal characteristics of EEG signals. Spatially, NeurIPT leverages
the 3D physical coordinates of electrodes, enabling effective transfer of
embedding across varying EEG settings, and develops Intra-Inter Lobe Pooling
(IILP) during fine-tuning to efficiently exploit regional brain features.
Empirical evaluations across eight downstream BCI datasets, via fine-tuning,
demonstrated NeurIPT consistently achieved state-of-the-art performance,
highlighting its broad applicability and robust generalization. Our work pushes
forward the state of FMs in EEG and offers insights into scalable and
generalizable neural information processing systems.

TL;DR: LANPO框架通过分离语言反馈和数值奖励的角色来解决LLM强化学习中的样本效率问题，语言指导探索，数值奖励驱动优化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统强化学习使用标量奖励会丢弃有价值的文本推理信息，导致样本效率低下。直接整合在线经验存在信息泄露和无关上下文导致行为崩溃的矛盾。

Method: LANPO构建动态经验池，采用奖励无关反思进行样本内自校正，通过相关抽象从样本间经验中提炼可泛化教训。

Result: 在数学推理基准测试中，7B和14B模型显著优于使用GRPO训练的强基线模型。

Conclusion: LANPO为将历史经验整合到LLM强化学习循环提供了稳健方法，创建了更有效和数据高效的学习智能体。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning in large language models (LLMs) often relies on scalar
rewards, a practice that discards valuable textual rationale buried in the
rollouts, forcing the model to explore \textit{de novo} with each attempt and
hindering sample efficiency. While LLMs can uniquely learn from language
feedback provided in-context, naively integrating on-line experiences into RL
training presents a paradox: feedback from the same problem risks information
leakage and memorization, while feedback from different problems often leads to
behavior collapse due to irrelevant context. To resolve this tension, we
propose \textbf{Language-And-Numerical Policy Optimization (LANPO)}, a
framework that cleanly separates the roles of feedback: language guides
exploration, while numerical rewards drive optimization. LANPO builds a dynamic
experience pool from past trials and introduces two principles to ensure
feedback is effective: \emph{Reward-Agnostic Reflection} for safe intra-sample
self-correction and \emph{Relevant Abstraction} to distill generalizable
lessons from inter-sample experiences. Across mathematical reasoning
benchmarks, LANPO enables 7B and 14B models to significantly outperform strong
baselines trained with GRPO in test accuracy. Our work provides a robust method
for integrating historical experiences into the LLM RL loop, creating more
effective and data-efficient learning agents.

Conclusion: 为结构感知分子生成建立了新范式，在计算药物发现中具有直接应用价值。

Abstract: Retrosynthesis prediction is fundamental to drug discovery and chemical
synthesis, requiring the identification of reactants that can produce a target
molecule. Current template-free methods struggle to capture the structural
invariance inherent in chemical reactions, where substantial molecular
scaffolds remain unchanged, leading to unnecessarily large search spaces and
reduced prediction accuracy. We introduce C-SMILES, a novel molecular
representation that decomposes traditional SMILES into element-token pairs with
five special tokens, effectively minimizing editing distance between reactants
and products. Building upon this representation, we incorporate a
copy-augmented mechanism that dynamically determines whether to generate new
tokens or preserve unchanged molecular fragments from the product. Our approach
integrates SMILES alignment guidance to enhance attention consistency with
ground-truth atom mappings, enabling more chemically coherent predictions.
Comprehensive evaluation on USPTO-50K and large-scale USPTO-FULL datasets
demonstrates significant improvements: 67.2% top-1 accuracy on USPTO-50K and
50.8% on USPTO-FULL, with 99.9% validity in generated molecules. This work
establishes a new paradigm for structure-aware molecular generation with direct
applications in computational drug discovery.

Abstract: Applications of machine learning in chemistry are often limited by the
scarcity and expense of labeled data, restricting traditional supervised
methods. In this work, we introduce a framework for molecular reasoning using
general-purpose Large Language Models (LLMs) that operates without requiring
labeled training data. Our method anchors chain-of-thought reasoning to the
molecular structure by using unique atomic identifiers. First, the LLM performs
a one-shot task to identify relevant fragments and their associated chemical
labels or transformation classes. In an optional second step, this
position-aware information is used in a few-shot task with provided class
examples to predict the chemical transformation. We apply our framework to
single-step retrosynthesis, a task where LLMs have previously underperformed.
Across academic benchmarks and expert-validated drug discovery molecules, our
work enables LLMs to achieve high success rates in identifying chemically
plausible reaction sites ($\geq90\%$), named reaction classes ($\geq40\%$), and
final reactants ($\geq74\%$). Beyond solving complex chemical tasks, our work
also provides a method to generate theoretically grounded synthetic datasets by
mapping chemical knowledge onto the molecular structure and thereby addressing
data scarcity.

Abstract: Deep learning models have proven enormously successful at using multiple
layers of representation to learn relevant features of structured data.
Encoding physical symmetries into these models can improve performance on
difficult tasks, and recent work has motivated the principle of parameter
symmetry breaking and restoration as a unifying mechanism underlying their
hierarchical learning dynamics. We evaluate the role of parameter symmetry and
network expressivity in the generalisation behaviour of neural networks when
learning a real-space renormalisation group (RG) transformation, using the
central limit theorem (CLT) as a test case map. We consider simple multilayer
perceptrons (MLPs) and graph neural networks (GNNs), and vary weight symmetries
and activation functions across architectures. Our results reveal a competition
between symmetry constraints and expressivity, with overly complex or
overconstrained models generalising poorly. We analytically demonstrate this
poor generalisation behaviour for certain constrained MLP architectures by
recasting the CLT as a cumulant recursion relation and making use of an
established framework to propagate cumulants through MLPs. We also empirically
validate an extension of this framework from MLPs to GNNs, elucidating the
internal information processing performed by these more complex models. These
findings offer new insight into the learning dynamics of symmetric networks and
their limitations in modelling structured physical transformations.

Abstract: Motivated by the geometric advantages of quaternions in representing
rotations and postures, we propose a quaternion-valued supervised learning
Hopfield-structured neural network (QSHNN) with a fully connected structure
inspired by the classic Hopfield neural network (HNN). Starting from a
continuous-time dynamical model of HNNs, we extend the formulation to the
quaternionic domain and establish the existence and uniqueness of fixed points
with asymptotic stability. For the learning rules, we introduce a periodic
projection strategy that modifies standard gradient descent by periodically
projecting each 4*4 block of the weight matrix onto the closest quaternionic
structure in the least-squares sense. This approach preserves both convergence
and quaternionic consistency throughout training. Benefiting from this rigorous
mathematical foundation, the experimental model implementation achieves high
accuracy, fast convergence, and strong reliability across randomly generated
target sets. Moreover, the evolution trajectories of the QSHNN exhibit
well-bounded curvature, i.e., sufficient smoothness, which is crucial for
applications such as control systems or path planning modules in robotic arms,
where joint postures are parameterized by quaternion neurons. Beyond these
application scenarios, the proposed model offers a practical implementation
framework and a general mathematical methodology for designing neural networks
under hypercomplex or non-commutative algebraic structures.

Method: 将多步推理建模为知识图上的s-t连通性问题，将模型的预训练参数知识表示为部分可能含噪声的子图，将增强视为查询真实边的过程。

Result: 发现了一个相变现象：当知识图断开成小分量时，通过增强寻找路径效率低下需要Ω(√n)次查询；一旦正确知识密度超过阈值形成巨分量，就能以期望常数次查询找到路径。

Conclusion: 该研究为测试时增强提供了理论框架，揭示了知识密度对增强效率的关键影响，为实际应用中设计高效增强策略提供了理论指导。

Abstract: Test-time augmentation, such as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) or tool
use, critically depends on an interplay between a model's parametric knowledge
and externally retrieved information. However, the theoretical underpinnings of
this relationship remain poorly understood. Specifically, it is not clear how
much pre-training knowledge is required to answer queries with a small number
of augmentation steps, which is a desirable property in practice. To address
this question, we formulate multi-step reasoning as an $s$-$t$ connectivity
problem on a knowledge graph. We represent a model's pre-training parametric
knowledge as a partial, potentially noisy subgraph. We view augmentation as
querying an oracle for true edges that augment the model's knowledge. Then, we
characterize the necessary and sufficient number of augmentation steps for the
model to generate an accurate answer given partial prior knowledge. One key
result shows a phase transition: if the prior knowledge graph over $n$ vertices
is disconnected into small components, then finding a path via augmentation is
inefficient and requires $\Omega(\sqrt{n})$ queries. On the other hand, once
the density of correct knowledge surpasses a threshold, forming a giant
component, we can find paths with an expected constant number of queries.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代训练流程通常涉及多阶段训练，每个阶段有不同的数据分布和目标，但现有的机器遗忘理论主要针对i.i.d.数据批次的训练，需要研究多阶段训练对遗忘的影响

Method: 通过理论和实验分析多阶段训练中的机器遗忘问题，使用梯度上升、NPO和SimNPO等局部遗忘算法在Llama和Qwen模型上进行实证研究

Result: 不同训练阶段顺序的模型在遗忘过程中行为出现分歧，GSM8K准确率下降差异超过20%，某些学习路径产生的模型遗忘速度较慢，概率质量重新分配也呈现路径依赖性

Conclusion: 重训练等价性对于局部遗忘算法来说是一个不适定的目标，在难以获取模型训练历史的情况下需要重新思考机器遗忘的定义和要求

Abstract: Machine unlearning seeks to selectively remove the "influence" of specific
training data on a model's outputs. The ideal goal is Retrain
Equivalence--behavior identical to a model trained from scratch on only the
retained data. This goal was formulated for models trained on i.i.d. data
batches, but modern pipelines often involve multi-stage training, with each
stage having a distinct data distribution and objective. Examples include LLM
fine-tuning for alignment, reasoning ability, etc. Our study shows via theory
and experiments that this shift to multi-stage training introduces a
fundamental barrier for machine unlearning. The theory indicates that the
outcome of local unlearning--methods that only use gradients computed on the
forget set--is path-dependent. That is, a model's behavior during unlearning is
influenced by the order of its training stages during learning, making it
impossible for path-oblivious algorithms to universally achieve Retrain
Equivalence. We empirically demonstrate the same phenomenon in LLM
post-training across Llama and Qwen models (1B to 14B) with gradient ascent,
NPO, and SimNPO local unlearning algorithms. Models fine-tuned via different
orderings of identical training stages diverge in behavior during unlearning,
with the degradation in GSM8K accuracy after unlearning varying by over 20%
across paths. We also observe that some learning paths consistently produce
models that unlearn slowly. During unlearning, whether the probability mass
gets squeezed into paraphrasing or alternative concepts is also path-dependent.
These results consistently show that Retrain Equivalence is an ill-posed target
for local unlearning algorithms, so long as the target models are trained in
stages. In situations where access to models' training histories is hard, the
current work calls for rethinking the definition and desiderata of machine
unlearning.

Conclusion: StructureFlow是理解系统行为机制的关键步骤，能够同时学习系统结构和条件群体动力学。

Abstract: Modeling dynamical systems and unraveling their underlying causal
relationships is central to many domains in the natural sciences. Various
physical systems, such as those arising in cell biology, are inherently
high-dimensional and stochastic in nature, and admit only partial, noisy state
measurements. This poses a significant challenge for addressing the problems of
modeling the underlying dynamics and inferring the network structure of these
systems. Existing methods are typically tailored either for structure learning
or modeling dynamics at the population level, but are limited in their ability
to address both problems together. In this work, we address both problems
simultaneously: we present StructureFlow, a novel and principled
simulation-free approach for jointly learning the structure and stochastic
population dynamics of physical systems. We showcase the utility of
StructureFlow for the tasks of structure learning from interventions and
dynamical (trajectory) inference of conditional population dynamics. We
empirically evaluate our approach on high-dimensional synthetic systems, a set
of biologically plausible simulated systems, and an experimental single-cell
dataset. We show that StructureFlow can learn the structure of underlying
systems while simultaneously modeling their conditional population dynamics --
a key step toward the mechanistic understanding of systems behavior.

Motivation: 现有的蛋白质-蛋白质对接工具依赖准确的评分函数来区分天然和非天然复合物。Vision Mamba架构在自然语言处理和计算机视觉领域表现出色，可能优于Transformer模型。

Method: 将PIsToN的Vision Transformer骨干网络替换为Vision Mamba架构，利用Mamba在图像补丁序列上的高效长程序列建模能力。

Result: 在多个广泛使用的大规模公共数据集上的评估表明，PUMBA持续优于其基于Transformer的前身PIsToN。

Conclusion: 使用Vision Mamba架构可以显著提升模型捕捉蛋白质-蛋白质界面特征中全局和局部模式的能力。

Abstract: Protein-protein docking tools help in studying interactions between proteins,
and are essential for drug, vaccine, and therapeutic development. However, the
accuracy of a docking tool depends on a robust scoring function that can
reliably differentiate between native and non-native complexes. PIsToN is a
state-of-the-art deep learning-based scoring function that uses Vision
Transformers in its architecture. Recently, the Mamba architecture has
demonstrated exceptional performance in both natural language processing and
computer vision, often outperforming Transformer-based models in their domains.
In this study, we introduce PUMBA (Protein-protein interface evaluation with
Vision Mamba), which improves PIsToN by replacing its Vision Transformer
backbone with Vision Mamba. This change allows us to leverage Mamba's efficient
long-range sequence modeling for sequences of image patches. As a result, the
model's ability to capture both global and local patterns in protein-protein
interface features is significantly improved. Evaluation on several
widely-used, large-scale public datasets demonstrates that PUMBA consistently
outperforms its original Transformer-based predecessor, PIsToN.

TL;DR: 提出了一种在无信息先验条件下进行主动目标发现的新方法，该方法具有理论依据和神经科学启发，保证先验估计的单调改进，在物种分布建模和遥感等领域显著优于基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在医疗成像、环境监测等数据获取成本高昂的领域，基于先验观测的战略采样至关重要。然而在数据极其有限或采样成本高的领域（如稀有物种发现、新发疾病诊断），现有基于强先验的方法难以泛化。

Method: 提出一个在无信息先验条件下实现有效主动目标发现的框架，该方法具有理论基础，受神经科学启发设计，具有内在可解释性，并保证每个新观测都能单调改进先验估计。

Result: 通过跨多个领域的综合实验和消融研究，包括物种分布建模和遥感，证明该方法显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 该方法能够在复杂现实场景中实现稳健探索和适应性，为数据稀缺领域的目标发现提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: In many scientific and engineering fields, where acquiring high-quality data
is expensive--such as medical imaging, environmental monitoring, and remote
sensing--strategic sampling of unobserved regions based on prior observations
is crucial for maximizing discovery rates within a constrained budget. The rise
of powerful generative models, such as diffusion models, has enabled active
target discovery in partially observable environments by leveraging learned
priors--probabilistic representations that capture underlying structure from
data. With guidance from sequentially gathered task-specific observations,
these models can progressively refine exploration and efficiently direct
queries toward promising regions. However, in domains where learning a strong
prior is infeasible due to extremely limited data or high sampling cost (such
as rare species discovery, diagnostics for emerging diseases, etc.), these
methods struggle to generalize. To overcome this limitation, we propose a novel
approach that enables effective active target discovery even in settings with
uninformative priors, ensuring robust exploration and adaptability in complex
real-world scenarios. Our framework is theoretically principled and draws
inspiration from neuroscience to guide its design. Unlike black-box policies,
our approach is inherently interpretable, providing clear insights into
decision-making. Furthermore, it guarantees a strong, monotonic improvement in
prior estimates with each new observation, leading to increasingly accurate
sampling and reinforcing both reliability and adaptability in dynamic settings.
Through comprehensive experiments and ablation studies across various domains,
including species distribution modeling and remote sensing, we demonstrate that
our method substantially outperforms baseline approaches.

*Ran Tong,Jiaqi Liu,Su Liu,Xin Hu,Lanruo Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一个紧凑、严格因果的临床时间序列基准，在MIT-BIH心律失常数据库上使用每秒心率数据。研究了心动过速风险评估和心率预测两个任务，比较了GRU-D和Transformer模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为纵向监测开发一个紧凑且严格因果的基准，评估不同模型在临床时间序列任务中的表现，特别是在资源受限环境下的适用性。

Method: 使用MIT-BIH心律失常数据库的每秒心率数据，采用记录级非重叠分割。比较GRU-D（RNN）和Transformer模型，使用匹配的训练预算，并与强非学习基线对比。评估采用温度缩放和分组自助置信区间。

Result: 在MIT-BIH数据集上，GRU-D在心动过速风险评估上略微优于Transformer，而Transformer在心率预测误差上明显低于GRU-D和持续性模型。

Conclusion: 在纵向监测中，模型选择是任务依赖的：紧凑RNN在短时域风险评分中仍具竞争力，而紧凑Transformer在点预测方面提供更清晰的增益。

Abstract: We present a compact, strictly causal benchmark for streaming clinical time
series on the MIT--BIH Arrhythmia Database using per-second heart rate. Two
tasks are studied under record-level, non-overlapping splits: near-term
tachycardia risk (next ten seconds) and one-step heart rate forecasting. We
compare a GRU-D (RNN) and a Transformer under matched training budgets against
strong non-learned baselines. Evaluation is calibration-aware for
classification and proper for forecasting, with temperature scaling and grouped
bootstrap confidence intervals. On MIT-BIH, GRU-D slightly surpasses the
Transformer for tachycardia risk, while the Transformer clearly lowers
forecasting error relative to GRU-D and persistence. Our results show that, in
longitudinal monitoring, model choice is task-dependent: compact RNNs remain
competitive for short-horizon risk scoring, whereas compact Transformers
deliver clearer gains for point forecasting.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文使用扩散方法精确分析噪声SGD，提供了高维设置下统计风险和隐私损失动态的连续时间视角，并研究了一种无需梯度敏感性显式知识的噪声SGD变体。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 噪声SGD已成为隐私保护机器学习的核心算法，但现有工作主要提供统计风险和隐私损失的边界分析，而过程的精确行为在高维设置中仍不清楚。

Method: 采用扩散方法分析噪声SGD，提供连续时间视角，专注于带有ℓ2正则化的最小二乘问题，研究无需梯度敏感性显式知识的SGD变体。

Result: 该方法能够精确捕捉高维设置下统计风险演化和隐私损失动态，提供了对噪声SGD过程的深入理解。

Conclusion: 扩散方法为分析噪声SGD提供了精确的连续时间框架，能够更好地理解高维设置下的隐私-优化权衡，且提出的变体消除了对梯度敏感性显式知识的需求。

Abstract: The interplay between optimization and privacy has become a central theme in
privacy-preserving machine learning. Noisy stochastic gradient descent (SGD)
has emerged as a cornerstone algorithm, particularly in large-scale settings.
These variants of gradient methods inject carefully calibrated noise into each
update to achieve differential privacy, the gold standard notion of rigorous
privacy guarantees. Prior work primarily provides various bounds on statistical
risk and privacy loss for noisy SGD, yet the \textit{exact} behavior of the
process remains unclear, particularly in high-dimensional settings. This work
leverages a diffusion approach to analyze noisy SGD precisely, providing a
continuous-time perspective that captures both statistical risk evolution and
privacy loss dynamics in high dimensions. Moreover, we study a variant of noisy
SGD that does not require explicit knowledge of gradient sensitivity, unlike
existing work that assumes or enforces sensitivity through gradient clipping.
Specifically, we focus on the least squares problem with $\ell_2$
regularization.

TL;DR: 提出了CLIP技术，通过客户端不变神经元剪枝和网络感知剪枝来解决安全联邦学习中由于计算和网络瓶颈导致的训练速度问题，在多个数据集上实现13%-34%的加速，精度影响在1.3%提升到2.6%下降之间。


<details>

Motivation: 安全联邦学习在异构设备部署时存在性能瓶颈，由于计算能力或网络能力受限的慢速客户端会拖慢所有参与客户端的训练速度。

Method: CLIP技术结合客户端不变神经元剪枝和网络感知剪枝，在训练过程中解决由慢速客户端引起的计算和网络瓶颈。

Result: 在多个数据集（CIFAR10、Shakespeare、FEMNIST）上实现13%到34%的加速，精度影响在1.3%提升到2.6%下降之间。

Conclusion: CLIP是首个针对深度神经网络安全聚合的慢速客户端缓解技术，能够显著加速安全联邦学习训练，同时保持可接受的精度损失。

Abstract: Secure federated learning (FL) preserves data privacy during distributed
model training. However, deploying such frameworks across heterogeneous devices
results in performance bottlenecks, due to straggler clients with limited
computational or network capabilities, slowing training for all participating
clients. This paper introduces the first straggler mitigation technique for
secure aggregation with deep neural networks. We propose CLIP, a client-side
invariant neuron pruning technique coupled with network-aware pruning, that
addresses compute and network bottlenecks due to stragglers during training
with minimal accuracy loss. Our technique accelerates secure FL training by 13%
to 34% across multiple datasets (CIFAR10, Shakespeare, FEMNIST) with an
accuracy impact of between 1.3% improvement to 2.6% reduction.

### [329] [On the Granularity of Causal Effect Identifiability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16703)
*Yizuo Chen,Adnan Darwiche*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文研究了基于状态的因果效应可识别性，发现在某些情况下，即使变量层面的因果效应不可识别，特定状态层面的因果效应仍然可识别，这需要上下文特定独立性和条件函数依赖等额外知识。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统因果效应可识别性定义基于变量层面，但实际应用中我们可能更关心特定状态（如特定治疗水平）对特定结果状态的影响。现有变量层面的框架可能错过这种更细粒度的可识别性。

Method: 通过分析状态层面的因果效应可识别性，考察上下文特定独立性、条件函数依赖等额外知识对可识别性的影响，并与变量层面的可识别性进行比较。

Result: 研究发现状态层面的因果效应可能在变量层面因果效应不可识别时仍然可识别，这种分离只有在获得额外知识时才发生。变量状态约束知识本身不能改善可识别性，但与其他知识结合时可以改善变量层面和状态层面的可识别性。

Conclusion: 基于状态的因果效应可识别性分析可以揭示传统变量层面框架可能错过的可识别机会，特别是在拥有上下文特定独立性等额外知识的情况下，为从观测数据估计因果效应提供了新的可能性。

Abstract: The classical notion of causal effect identifiability is defined in terms of
treatment and outcome variables. In this note, we consider the identifiability
of state-based causal effects: how an intervention on a particular state of
treatment variables affects a particular state of outcome variables. We
demonstrate that state-based causal effects may be identifiable even when
variable-based causal effects may not. Moreover, we show that this separation
occurs only when additional knowledge -- such as context-specific
independencies and conditional functional dependencies -- is available. We
further examine knowledge that constrains the states of variables, and show
that such knowledge does not improve identifiability on its own but can improve
both variable-based and state-based identifiability when combined with other
knowledge such as context-specific independencies. Our findings highlight
situations where causal effects of interest may be estimable from observational
data and this identifiability may be missed by existing variable-based
frameworks.

Result: 模型能够准确预测每日、每周和每月的充电需求，适用于不同充电站点的多样化使用模式。

Conclusion: 该模块化框架为电动汽车充电设施的基础设施规划、能源管理和电网集成提供了有效的预测工具。

Abstract: This paper presents a framework for processing EV charging load data in order
to forecast future load predictions using a Recurrent Neural Network,
specifically an LSTM. The framework processes a large set of raw data from
multiple locations and transforms it with normalization and feature extraction
to train the LSTM. The pre-processing stage corrects for missing or incomplete
values by interpolating and normalizing the measurements. This information is
then fed into a Long Short-Term Memory Model designed to capture the short-term
fluctuations while also interpreting the long-term trends in the charging data.
Experimental results demonstrate the model's ability to accurately predict
charging demand across multiple time scales (daily, weekly, and monthly),
providing valuable insights for infrastructure planning, energy management, and
grid integration of EV charging facilities. The system's modular design allows
for adaptation to different charging locations with varying usage patterns,
making it applicable across diverse deployment scenarios.

Conclusion: 所提出的框架能够准确预测学习曲线，支持零样本预测，并为模型缩放提供可靠的预测依据。

Abstract: The prediction of learning curves for Natural Language Processing (NLP)
models enables informed decision-making to meet specific performance
objectives, while reducing computational overhead and lowering the costs
associated with dataset acquisition and curation. In this work, we formulate
the prediction task as a multitask learning problem, where each task's data is
modelled as being organized within a two-layer hierarchy. To model the shared
information and dependencies across tasks and hierarchical levels, we employ
latent variable multi-output Gaussian Processes, enabling to account for task
correlations and supporting zero-shot prediction of learning curves (LCs). We
demonstrate that this approach facilitates the development of probabilistic
scaling laws at lower costs. Applying an active learning strategy, LCs can be
queried to reduce predictive uncertainty and provide predictions close to
ground truth scaling laws. We validate our framework on three small-scale NLP
datasets with up to $30$ LCs. These are obtained from nanoGPT models, from
bilingual translation using mBART and Transformer models, and from multilingual
translation using M2M100 models of varying sizes.

TL;DR: 提出了一种用于SegDeformer的联合特征和任务解码方法，在车载和分布式应用中降低计算复杂度，同时保持语义分割性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有卷积神经网络用于联合源和任务解码，但未研究基于transformer的替代方案如SegDeformer，后者性能更优但计算复杂度更高。

Method: 为SegDeformer提出联合特征和任务解码方法，在车载和分布式应用中降低计算复杂度。

Result: 在车载应用中，Cityscapes数据集fps提升11.7倍(1.4到16.5 fps)，ADE20K数据集提升3.5倍(43.3到154.3 fps)，mIoU与基线相当。在分布式应用中，在广泛比特率范围内实现SOTA mIoU，仅使用之前SOTA 0.14%(ADE20K)和0.04%(Cityscapes)的云DNN参数。

Conclusion: 该方法在保持transformer性能优势的同时，显著降低了计算复杂度，提高了云平台的可扩展性并减少了车载计算负担。

Abstract: Modern automotive systems leverage deep neural networks (DNNs) for semantic
segmentation and operate in two key application areas: (1) In-car, where the
DNN solely operates in the vehicle without strict constraints on the data rate.
(2) Distributed, where one DNN part operates in the vehicle and the other part
typically on a large-scale cloud platform with a particular constraint on
transmission bitrate efficiency. Typically, both applications share an image
and source encoder, while each uses distinct (joint) source and task decoders.
Prior work utilized convolutional neural networks for joint source and task
decoding but did not investigate transformer-based alternatives such as
SegDeformer, which offer superior performance at the cost of higher
computational complexity. In this work, we propose joint feature and task
decoding for SegDeformer, thereby enabling lower computational complexity in
both in-car and distributed applications, despite SegDeformer's computational
demands. This improves scalability in the cloud while reducing in-car
computational complexity. For the in-car application, we increased the frames
per second (fps) by up to a factor of $11.7$ ($1.4$ fps to $16.5$ fps) on
Cityscapes and by up to a factor of $3.5$ ($43.3$ fps to $154.3$ fps) on
ADE20K, while being on-par w.r.t.\ the mean intersection over union (mIoU) of
the transformer-based baseline that doesn't compress by a source codec. For the
distributed application, we achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) over a wide range
of bitrates on the mIoU metric, while using only $0.14$\% ($0.04$\%) of cloud
DNN parameters used in previous SOTA, reported on ADE20K (Cityscapes).

TL;DR: 提出SAMOSA方法用于开放集主动学习，通过基于典型性的样本选择策略，在包含不相关类别的未标注数据中有效识别信息丰富的样本，提升模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代机器学习需要大量数据标注，但标注成本高昂。开放集主动学习旨在从未标注数据中选择信息丰富的样本，其中包含不相关或未知类别。

Method: 基于SGD和SAM的理论发现，提出SAMOSA方法，根据样本典型性主动查询样本，识别嵌入流形中靠近决策边界的非典型样本。

Result: 在多个数据集上相比现有方法准确率提升高达3%，且不引入额外计算开销。

Conclusion: SAMOSA能够有效识别对目标类别高度信息丰富且有助于区分目标类别与不需要类别的样本，是有效的开放集主动学习查询算法。

Abstract: Modern machine learning solutions require extensive data collection where
labeling remains costly. To reduce this burden, open set active learning
approaches aim to select informative samples from a large pool of unlabeled
data that includes irrelevant or unknown classes. In this context, we propose
Sharpness Aware Minimization for Open Set Active Learning (SAMOSA) as an
effective querying algorithm. Building on theoretical findings concerning the
impact of data typicality on the generalization properties of traditional
stochastic gradient descent (SGD) and sharpness-aware minimization (SAM),
SAMOSA actively queries samples based on their typicality. SAMOSA effectively
identifies atypical samples that belong to regions of the embedding manifold
close to the model decision boundaries. Therefore, SAMOSA prioritizes the
samples that are (i) highly informative for the targeted classes, and (ii)
useful for distinguishing between targeted and unwanted classes. Extensive
experiments show that SAMOSA achieves up to 3% accuracy improvement over the
state of the art across several datasets, while not introducing computational
overhead. The source code of our experiments is available at:

<details>

Motivation: 3D第一人称视频游戏是实时多模态推理的挑战性环境，需要解决现有数据集规模小、多样性不足的问题。

Method: 收集大规模多样化的游戏数据集，学习逆动力学模型来推断缺失动作，使用行为克隆训练文本条件智能体，采用支持实时推理的自定义架构。

Conclusion: 成功开发了基于文本指令的3D游戏智能体，为多模态推理提供了有效解决方案，但仍有改进空间。

Abstract: We argue that 3-D first-person video games are a challenging environment for
real-time multi-modal reasoning. We first describe our dataset of human
game-play, collected across a large variety of 3-D first-person games, which is
both substantially larger and more diverse compared to prior publicly disclosed
datasets, and contains text instructions. We demonstrate that we can learn an
inverse dynamics model from this dataset, which allows us to impute actions on
a much larger dataset of publicly available videos of human game play that lack
recorded actions. We then train a text-conditioned agent for game playing using
behavior cloning, with a custom architecture capable of realtime inference on a
consumer GPU. We show the resulting model is capable of playing a variety of
3-D games and responding to text input. Finally, we outline some of the
remaining challenges such as long-horizon tasks and quantitative evaluation
across a large set of games.

<details>

Motivation: 将2D掩码图建模的成功扩展到3D面临两个冲突挑战：避免2D结构泄漏到解码器，同时为重建重掩码原子提供足够的2D上下文信息。

Method: 提出3D-GSRD模型，核心创新是选择性重掩码解码(SRD)，仅从编码器表示中重掩码3D相关信息，同时保留2D图结构。该方法与3D关系变换器编码器和结构无关解码器协同集成。

Conclusion: 选择性重掩码解码与结构无关解码器相结合，增强了编码器在分子表示学习中的作用，实现了强大的下游性能。

Abstract: Masked graph modeling (MGM) is a promising approach for molecular
representation learning (MRL).However, extending the success of re-mask
decoding from 2D to 3D MGM is non-trivial, primarily due to two conflicting
challenges: avoiding 2D structure leakage to the decoder, while still providing
sufficient 2D context for reconstructing re-masked atoms.To address these
challenges, we propose 3D-GSRD: a 3D Molecular Graph Auto-Encoder with
Selective Re-mask Decoding. The core innovation of 3D-GSRD lies in its
Selective Re-mask Decoding(SRD), which re-masks only 3D-relevant information
from encoder representations while preserving the 2D graph structures.This SRD
is synergistically integrated with a 3D Relational-Transformer(3D-ReTrans)
encoder alongside a structure-independent decoder. We analyze that SRD,
combined with the structure-independent decoder, enhances the encoder's role in
MRL. Extensive experiments show that 3D-GSRD achieves strong downstream
performance, setting a new state-of-the-art on 7 out of 8 targets in the widely
used MD17 molecular property prediction benchmark. The code is released at

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着语言模型规模的快速扩展，其计算、内存和能耗需求急剧增加，使得训练和部署变得不可持续。量化作为一种压缩技术可以缓解这些问题，但传统的均匀低比特量化会降低精度，因此需要混合精度量化来平衡效率和准确性。

Conclusion: 论文总结了混合精度量化在语言模型中的开放问题和未来方向，包括硬件感知设计、激活量化和可扩展优化方法。这项工作为理解大规模语言模型混合精度量化的当前格局和研究前景提供了参考。

Abstract: The rapid scaling of language models (LMs) has resulted in unprecedented
computational, memory, and energy requirements, making their training and
deployment increasingly unsustainable. Quantization has emerged as an essential
compression technique to reduce model size, alleviate memory bottlenecks, and
accelerate inference. However, while uniform low-bit quantization (e.g., INT8,
INT4) provides significant efficiency gains, it can degrade accuracy in
sensitive components of transformer-based LMs. Mixed-precision quantization
offers a promising alternative by selectively allocating precision across
layers or within tensors to balance efficiency and accuracy. This survey
provides a comprehensive overview of Mixed-Precision quantization frameworks
for LMs (MXPLMs). We first review quantization fundamentals, including uniform
and non-uniform quantizers, quantization granularity, and methods widely used
in post-training quantization. We then categorize and compare recent MXPLM
frameworks according to their bit allocation strategies and precision
configurations across weights, activations, and key-value caches. A comparative
analysis highlights differences in perplexity, zero-shot task performance, and
deployment trade-offs. Furthermore, we contrast MXPLMs with earlier
mixed-precision quantization methods for deep neural networks, identifying
strategies that transfer and those that face challenges in the LM setting.
Finally, we summarize open issues and future directions, including
hardware-aware design, activation quantization, and scalable optimization
methods for billion-parameter models. By consolidating recent advances, this
work serves as a reference for understanding the current landscape and research
prospects of mixed-precision quantization for large-scale language models.

*Weilin Wan,Weizhong Zhang,Cheng Jin*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种计算预算感知的数据选择方法(CADS)，将计算预算约束纳入数据选择过程，通过双层优化框架实现，在视觉和语言基准测试中比基线方法性能提升最高达14.42%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有数据选择方法忽略了计算预算约束，将数据选择和重要性评估与预算限制分开处理。实证研究表明，在不同预算下，没有算法能始终优于其他方法（甚至随机选择）。因此，计算预算必须成为数据选择策略的核心组成部分。

Method: 提出了计算预算感知数据选择(CADS)方法，采用双层优化框架：内层循环在计算预算约束下在选定的训练数据子集上训练模型，外层循环基于模型评估优化数据选择。通过概率重参数化策略和Hessian-free策略梯度估计器解决Hessian矩阵估计问题，将内层优化问题转化为外层目标的惩罚项以提高效率。

Result: 在视觉和语言基准测试中，该方法比基线方法实现了最高14.42%的性能提升，证明了计算预算感知数据选择的有效性。

Conclusion: 计算预算应该成为数据选择策略的核心组成部分，提出的CADS方法通过双层优化框架成功解决了预算约束下的数据选择问题，在多个基准测试中显著优于现有方法。

Abstract: Data selection improves computational efficiency by choosing informative
subsets of training samples. However, existing methods ignore the compute
budget, treating data selection and importance evaluation independently of
compute budget constraints. Yet empirical studies show no algorithm can
consistently outperform others (or even random selection) across varying
budgets. We therefore argue that compute budget must be integral to
data-selection strategies, since different budgets impose distinct requirements
on data quantity, quality, and distribution for effective training. To this
end, we propose a novel Computational budget-Aware Data Selection (CADS) method
and naturally formulate it into a bilevel optimization framework, where the
inner loop trains the model within the constraints of the computational budget
on some selected subset of training data, while the outer loop optimizes data
selection based on model evaluation. Our technical contributions lie in
addressing two main challenges in solving this bilevel optimization problem:
the expensive Hessian matrix estimation for outer-loop gradients and the
computational burden of achieving inner-loop optimality during iterations. To
solve the first issue, we propose a probabilistic reparameterization strategy
and compute the gradient using a Hessian-free policy gradient estimator. To
address the second challenge, we transform the inner optimization problem into
a penalty term in the outer objective, further discovering that we only need to
estimate the minimum of a one-dimensional loss to calculate the gradient,
significantly improving efficiency. Extensive experiments show that our method
achieves performance gains of up to 14.42% over baselines in vision and
language benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决Transformer模型在扩展时KV缓存带来的内存和计算成本问题，同时保持或增强模型表示能力。

Method: 从第二层开始，每层重用第一层一半的Value头，正常计算另一半，减少Value投影和V缓存近50%。

Conclusion: SkipV1Former提供了一种有效的方法来减少KV缓存成本并增强模型表示，可与现有方法结合实现进一步优化。

Abstract: Transformer models have driven breakthroughs across various language tasks by
their strong capability to learn rich contextual representations. Scaling them
to improve representation, however, often demands substantial memory and
compute costs, such as the Key-Value (KV) cache used during auto-regressive
decoding. Skip connections offer a promising way to improve representation
without bloating resource usage, yet most prior works either improve
expressivity while leaving KV costs unchanged, or reduce memory at the cost of
weaker representation. In this work, we propose SkipV1Former, a Transformer
variant that uses skip connections from the first layer's Value heads to
strengthen model representation and reduce KV cache. Specifically, from the
second block onward, each layer reuses half of its Value heads from the very
first layer, while computing the other half as usual-cutting Value projections
and V cache by nearly 50 \%. Theoretically, we show that routing uncompressed
first-layer Values into deeper layers restores information lost to compression
and accelerates the model's implicit mesa-optimization-a key pattern of
Transformer in auto-regressive tasks. Empirically, across different model
scales, SkipV1Former delivers consistent reductions of approximately 25 \% in
KV cache while improving perplexity relative to standard Multi-Head Attention
(MHA) Transformers and some advanced variants. Moreover, we propose a recipe
for uptraining existing MHA Transformer checkpoints to SkipV1Former with only
10-15\% additional compute. Finally, SkipV1Former can seamlessly combine
advanced methods like Group-Query Attention and Multi-Latent Attention to
achieve further KV cache savings and performance improvement. When combined
with YOCO, it cuts KV cache size by nearly 50 \% while still improving
performance.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法专注于识别奖励的父节点然后应用经典赌博机方法，或联合学习父节点同时最小化遗憾。本文研究这些策略是否最优。

Method: 分析已知和未知父节点集大小的情况，建立捕捉动作空间组合结构的遗憾下界，提出绕过图和父节点恢复的近乎最优算法。

Result: 实验证明在各种环境中，新方法与现有基线之间存在显著的性能差距。

Conclusion: 父节点识别对于遗憾最小化是不必要的，学习父节点集是次优策略。

Abstract: We study regret minimization in causal bandits under causal sufficiency where
the underlying causal structure is not known to the agent. Previous work has
focused on identifying the reward's parents and then applying classic bandit
methods to them, or jointly learning the parents while minimizing regret. We
investigate whether such strategies are optimal. Somewhat counterintuitively,
our results show that learning the parent set is suboptimal. We do so by
proving that there exist instances where regret minimization and parent
identification are fundamentally conflicting objectives. We further analyze
both the known and unknown parent set size regimes, establish novel regret
lower bounds that capture the combinatorial structure of the action space.
Building on these insights, we propose nearly optimal algorithms that bypass
graph and parent recovery, demonstrating that parent identification is indeed
unnecessary for regret minimization. Experiments confirm that there exists a
large performance gap between our method and existing baselines in various
environments.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于半监督学习和正未标记学习的深度学习方法，用于考古预测建模，在标签稀缺的情况下有效识别未发现的考古遗址位置。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 考古预测建模面临结构性标签稀缺的挑战：正样本稀少且大多数位置未被标记。需要解决在严重类别不平衡情况下的预测问题。

Method: 采用半监督正未标记学习策略，实现为语义分割模型，使用动态伪标签和条件随机场来提高标签置信度。在两个代表性考古时期数据集上进行评估。

Result: 在数字高程模型数据集上表现与最先进的LAMAP方法相当，但获得更高的Dice分数。在原始卫星图像上保持性能并产生更具可解释性的预测表面。

Conclusion: 半监督学习为在大规模稀疏标注景观中识别未发现遗址提供了一种有前景的方法。

Abstract: Archaeological predictive modelling estimates where undiscovered sites are
likely to occur by combining known locations with environmental, cultural, and
geospatial variables. We address this challenge using a deep learning approach
but must contend with structural label scarcity inherent to archaeology:
positives are rare, and most locations are unlabeled. To address this, we adopt
a semi-supervised, positive-unlabeled (PU) learning strategy, implemented as a
semantic segmentation model and evaluated on two datasets covering a
representative range of archaeological periods. Our approach employs dynamic
pseudolabeling, refined with a Conditional Random Field (CRF) implemented via
an RNN, increasing label confidence under severe class imbalance. On a
geospatial dataset derived from a digital elevation model (DEM), our model
performs on par with the state-of-the-art, LAMAP, while achieving higher Dice
scores. On raw satellite imagery, assessed end-to-end with stratified k-fold
cross-validation, it maintains performance and yields predictive surfaces with
improved interpretability. Overall, our results indicate that semi-supervised
learning offers a promising approach to identifying undiscovered sites across
large, sparsely annotated landscapes.

*Ming Zhong,Zhenya Yan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出线性注意力神经算子(LANO)，通过引入少量代理令牌来调解全局交互，在保持softmax注意力表达能力的同时实现线性复杂度，解决了传统transformer架构中可扩展性与精度的权衡问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决基于transformer的神经算子架构面临的基本可扩展性-精度权衡：softmax注意力精度高但复杂度为二次方，而线性注意力变体虽然复杂度降低但精度显著下降。

Method: 引入紧凑的代理令牌集(M ≪ N)来调解N个令牌之间的全局交互，形成线性复杂度的代理注意力机制，同时保持softmax注意力的表达能力。

Result: 理论上证明了通用逼近性质，实证上在标准基准测试中超越当前最先进的神经PDE求解器，平均精度提升19.5%。

Conclusion: LANO通过在软注意力性能和线性复杂度之间架起桥梁，为科学机器学习应用建立了可扩展、高精度的基础。

Abstract: Neural operators offer a powerful data-driven framework for learning mappings
between function spaces, in which the transformer-based neural operator
architecture faces a fundamental scalability-accuracy trade-off: softmax
attention provides excellent fidelity but incurs quadratic complexity
$\mathcal{O}(N^2 d)$ in the number of mesh points $N$ and hidden dimension $d$,
while linear attention variants reduce cost to $\mathcal{O}(N d^2)$ but often
suffer significant accuracy degradation. To address the aforementioned
challenge, in this paper, we present a novel type of neural operators, Linear
Attention Neural Operator (LANO), which achieves both scalability and high
accuracy by reformulating attention through an agent-based mechanism. LANO
resolves this dilemma by introducing a compact set of $M$ agent tokens $(M \ll
N)$ that mediate global interactions among $N$ tokens. This agent attention
mechanism yields an operator layer with linear complexity $\mathcal{O}(MN d)$
while preserving the expressive power of softmax attention. Theoretically, we
demonstrate the universal approximation property, thereby demonstrating
improved conditioning and stability properties. Empirically, LANO surpasses
current state-of-the-art neural PDE solvers, including Transolver with
slice-based softmax attention, achieving average $19.5\%$ accuracy improvement
across standard benchmarks. By bridging the gap between linear complexity and
softmax-level performance, LANO establishes a scalable, high-accuracy
foundation for scientific machine learning applications.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了TRPINN方法，在Sobolev-Slobodeckij范数H^{1/2}(∂Ω)中强制执行边界损失，这是与H^1(Ω)相关的正确迹空间。该方法降低了计算成本，提高了收敛稳定性，并证明了在H^1(Ω)意义上的收敛性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准PINNs在处理高度振荡的Dirichlet边界条件时可能失败，需要更精确的边界处理方法来提高收敛性和稳定性。

Method: 使用TRPINN方法，在正确的迹空间H^{1/2}(∂Ω)中强制执行边界损失，仅计算理论必要的半范数部分，避免离散化中的分母求值。

Result: 数值实验显示，在Laplace方程中，TRPINN在标准PINNs失败的情况下仍能成功，性能提升1-3个十进制数字。通过NTK分析证明TRPINN比标准PINNs收敛更快。

Conclusion: TRPINN通过精确的迹空间处理，显著提高了PINNs在处理复杂边界条件时的性能和稳定性。

Abstract: We propose an enhanced physics-informed neural network (PINN), the Trace
Regularity Physics-Informed Neural Network (TRPINN), which enforces the
boundary loss in the Sobolev-Slobodeckij norm $H^{1/2}(\partial \Omega)$, the
correct trace space associated with $H^1(\Omega)$. We reduce computational cost
by computing only the theoretically essential portion of the semi-norm and
enhance convergence stability by avoiding denominator evaluations in the
discretization. By incorporating the exact $H^{1/2}(\partial \Omega)$ norm, we
show that the approximation converges to the true solution in the
$H^{1}(\Omega)$ sense, and, through Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) analysis, we
demonstrate that TRPINN can converge faster than standard PINNs. Numerical
experiments on the Laplace equation with highly oscillatory Dirichlet boundary
conditions exhibit cases where TRPINN succeeds even when standard PINNs fail,
and show performance improvements of one to three decimal digits.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 稀疏自编码器依赖输入进行解释，孤立研究不完整。多项式作为代数基元可独立分析，能描述从线性概念到复杂流形的结构。

Method: 使用双线性自编码器高效分解表示为二次多项式，通过改进实现重要性排序、聚类和激活稀疏性。

Result: 开发了非线性但可通过代数性质分析潜在表示的方法，为可解释表示提供新途径。

Conclusion: 这是通过代数性质实现非线性但可分析潜在表示的第一步，为神经网络表示的可解释性研究开辟了新方向。

Abstract: Sparse autoencoders are a standard tool for uncovering interpretable latent
representations in neural networks. Yet, their interpretation depends on the
inputs, making their isolated study incomplete. Polynomials offer a solution;
they serve as algebraic primitives that can be analysed without reference to
input and can describe structures ranging from linear concepts to complicated
manifolds. This work uses bilinear autoencoders to efficiently decompose
representations into quadratic polynomials. We discuss improvements that induce
importance ordering, clustering, and activation sparsity. This is an initial
step toward nonlinear yet analysable latents through their algebraic
properties.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ProtoMol是一个原型引导的多模态分子表示学习框架，通过分层编码器和层间双向跨模态注意力机制，实现分子图与文本描述的细粒度整合和语义对齐。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多模态方法存在两个关键局限：1）仅在编码器最后一层进行跨模态交互，忽略了分层语义依赖；2）缺乏统一的原型空间来实现模态间的鲁棒对齐。

Method: 使用双分支分层编码器（GNN处理分子图，Transformer编码文本），引入层间双向跨模态注意力机制，构建共享原型空间与可学习的类特定锚点。

Result: 在多个基准数据集上的广泛实验表明，ProtoMol在各种分子性质预测任务中持续优于最先进的基线方法。

Conclusion: ProtoMol通过分层语义对齐和原型引导，显著提升了多模态分子表示学习的性能，为药物毒性、生物活性和物理化学性质预测提供了更鲁棒和可靠的解决方案。

Abstract: Multimodal molecular representation learning, which jointly models molecular
graphs and their textual descriptions, enhances predictive accuracy and
interpretability by enabling more robust and reliable predictions of drug
toxicity, bioactivity, and physicochemical properties through the integration
of structural and semantic information. However, existing multimodal methods
suffer from two key limitations: (1) they typically perform cross-modal
interaction only at the final encoder layer, thus overlooking hierarchical
semantic dependencies; (2) they lack a unified prototype space for robust
alignment between modalities. To address these limitations, we propose
ProtoMol, a prototype-guided multimodal framework that enables fine-grained
integration and consistent semantic alignment between molecular graphs and
textual descriptions. ProtoMol incorporates dual-branch hierarchical encoders,
utilizing Graph Neural Networks to process structured molecular graphs and
Transformers to encode unstructured texts, resulting in comprehensive
layer-wise representations. Then, ProtoMol introduces a layer-wise
bidirectional cross-modal attention mechanism that progressively aligns
semantic features across layers. Furthermore, a shared prototype space with
learnable, class-specific anchors is constructed to guide both modalities
toward coherent and discriminative representations. Extensive experiments on
multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that ProtoMol consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art baselines across a variety of molecular property prediction
tasks.

Conclusion: DrivAerStar是首个连接学术机器学习研究和工业CFD实践的数据集，为汽车开发中的数据驱动空气动力学优化设立了新标准，展示了将高保真物理模拟与AI集成的新范式。

Abstract: Vehicle aerodynamics optimization has become critical for automotive
electrification, where drag reduction directly determines electric vehicle
range and energy efficiency. Traditional approaches face an intractable
trade-off: computationally expensive Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD)
simulations requiring weeks per design iteration, or simplified models that
sacrifice production-grade accuracy. While machine learning offers
transformative potential, existing datasets exhibit fundamental limitations --
inadequate mesh resolution, missing vehicle components, and validation errors
exceeding 5% -- preventing deployment in industrial workflows. We present
DrivAerStar, comprising 12,000 industrial-grade automotive CFD simulations
generated using $\text{STAR-CCM+}^\unicode{xAE}$ software. The dataset
systematically explores three vehicle configurations through 20 Computer Aided
Design (CAD) parameters via Free Form Deformation (FFD) algorithms, including
complete engine compartments and cooling systems with realistic internal
airflow. DrivAerStar achieves wind tunnel validation accuracy below 1.04% -- a
five-fold improvement over existing datasets -- through refined mesh strategies
with strict wall $y^+$ control. Benchmarks demonstrate that models trained on
this data achieve production-ready accuracy while reducing computational costs
from weeks to minutes. This represents the first dataset bridging academic
machine learning research and industrial CFD practice, establishing a new
standard for data-driven aerodynamic optimization in automotive development.
Beyond automotive applications, DrivAerStar demonstrates a paradigm for
integrating high-fidelity physics simulations with Artificial Intelligence (AI)
across engineering disciplines where computational constraints currently limit
innovation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的持续表示学习方法在相似性匹配阶段存在多重共线性问题，且更先进的方法计算成本过高，不适合实时低延迟应用。

Method: 提出Fly-CL框架，利用生物启发的设计渐进式解决多重共线性，实现更有效的相似性匹配，具有低时间复杂度。

Result: Fly-CL显著减少训练时间，在多种网络架构和数据环境下达到或超越当前最先进方法的性能。

Conclusion: Fly-CL通过生物启发设计有效解决了持续学习中的多重共线性挑战，为实时低延迟应用提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Using a nearly-frozen pretrained model, the continual representation learning
paradigm reframes parameter updates as a similarity-matching problem to
mitigate catastrophic forgetting. However, directly leveraging pretrained
features for downstream tasks often suffers from multicollinearity in the
similarity-matching stage, and more advanced methods can be computationally
prohibitive for real-time, low-latency applications. Inspired by the fly
olfactory circuit, we propose Fly-CL, a bio-inspired framework compatible with
a wide range of pretrained backbones. Fly-CL substantially reduces training
time while achieving performance comparable to or exceeding that of current
state-of-the-art methods. We theoretically show how Fly-CL progressively
resolves multicollinearity, enabling more effective similarity matching with
low time complexity. Extensive simulation experiments across diverse network
architectures and data regimes validate Fly-CL's effectiveness in addressing
this challenge through a biologically inspired design. Code is available at

*Heming Zou,Yixiu Mao,Yun Qu,Qi Wang,Xiangyang Ji*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了UDS（Utility-Diversity Sampling）框架，用于在监督微调中实现高效的在线批量选择，通过平衡数据效用和多样性来优化训练过程。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的在线批量选择方法存在三个主要问题：(i) 仅依赖数据效用而忽略多样性；(ii) 需要外部资源如参考模型或验证集；(iii) 训练时间超过全数据集训练。这些问题促使开发更高效的批量选择方法。

Method: UDS框架使用logits矩阵的核范数来捕捉数据效用和样本内多样性，同时通过轻量级历史样本缓冲区的低维嵌入比较来估计样本间多样性。该设计无需外部资源和不必要的反向传播，确保计算效率。

Result: 在多个基准测试上的实验表明，UDS在不同数据预算下始终优于最先进的在线批量选择方法，并且与全数据集微调相比显著减少了训练时间。

Conclusion: UDS提供了一个高效且无需外部资源的在线批量选择解决方案，在监督微调中实现了更好的性能与训练效率的平衡。

Abstract: Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) is a commonly used technique to adapt large
language models (LLMs) to downstream tasks. In practice, SFT on a full dataset
is computationally expensive and sometimes suffers from overfitting or bias
amplification. This facilitates the rise of data curation in SFT, which
prioritizes the most valuable data to optimze. This work studies the online
batch selection family that dynamically scores and filters samples during the
training process. However, existing popular methods often (i) rely merely on
the utility of data to select a subset while neglecting other crucial factors
like diversity, (ii) rely on external resources such as reference models or
validation sets, and (iii) incur extra training time over full-dataset
training. To address these limitations, this work develops \textbf{UDS
(Utility-Diversity Sampling)}, a framework for efficient online batch selection
in SFT. UDS leverages the nuclear norm of the logits matrix to capture both
data utility and intra-sample diversity, while estimating inter-sample
diversity through efficient low-dimensional embedding comparisons with a
lightweight memory buffer of historical samples. Such a design eliminates the
need for external resources and unnecessary backpropagation, securing
computational efficiency. Experiments on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that
UDS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art online batch selection methods
under varying data budgets, and significantly reduces training time compared to
full-dataset fine-tuning. Code is available at https://github.com/gfyddha/UDS.

TL;DR: UniGTE是一个指令调优的编码器-解码器框架，通过结合图结构和语义推理，在无需任务特定监督的情况下实现跨任务和跨领域的零样本图推理。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统图神经网络受限于固定标签空间，而大语言模型难以捕捉图结构，因此需要一种能够统一结构推理和语义推理的方法来处理未见过的图任务。

Method: 编码器使用可学习对齐标记和结构感知的图-文本注意力机制增强预训练自回归LLM，解码器使用冻结的LLM基于编码表示预测任务答案并重构输入图的自然语言描述。

Result: 在节点分类、链接预测、图分类和图回归任务上实现了新的零样本最先进结果，在跨任务和跨域设置中表现出色。

Conclusion: 图结构与LLM语义的紧密集成能够实现鲁棒且可迁移的图推理能力。

Abstract: Generalizing to unseen graph tasks without task-specific supervision is
challenging: conventional graph neural networks are typically tied to a fixed
label space, while large language models (LLMs) struggle to capture graph
structure. We introduce UniGTE, an instruction-tuned encoder-decoder framework
that unifies structural and semantic reasoning. The encoder augments a
pretrained autoregressive LLM with learnable alignment tokens and a
structure-aware graph-text attention mechanism, enabling it to attend jointly
to a tokenized graph and a natural-language task prompt while remaining
permutation-invariant to node order. This yields compact, task-aware graph
representations. Conditioned solely on these representations, a frozen LLM
decoder predicts and reconstructs: it outputs the task answer and
simultaneously paraphrases the input graph in natural language. The
reconstruction objective regularizes the encoder to preserve structural cues.
UniGTE is instruction-tuned on five datasets spanning node-level, edge-level,
and graph-level tasks across diverse domains, yet requires no fine-tuning at
inference. It achieves new state-of-the-art zero-shot results on node
classification, link prediction, graph classification, and graph regression
under cross-task and cross-domain settings, demonstrating that tight
integration of graph structure with LLM semantics enables robust, transferable
graph reasoning.

Abstract: Neural networks that incorporate geometric relationships respecting SE(3)
group transformations (e.g. rotations and translations) are increasingly
important in molecular applications, such as molecular property prediction,
protein structure modeling, and materials design. These models, known as
SE(3)-equivariant neural networks, ensure outputs transform predictably with
input coordinate changes by explicitly encoding spatial atomic positions.
Although libraries such as E3NN [4] and SE(3)-TRANSFORMER [3 ] offer powerful
implementations, they often require substantial deep learning or mathematical
prior knowledge and lack complete training pipelines. We extend DEEPCHEM [ 13]
with support for ready-to-use equivariant models, enabling scientists with
minimal deep learning background to build, train, and evaluate models, such as
SE(3)-Transformer and Tensor Field Networks. Our implementation includes
equivariant models, complete training pipelines, and a toolkit of equivariant
utilities, supported with comprehensive tests and documentation, to facilitate
both application and further development of SE(3)-equivariant models.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of electricity prices is crucial for stakeholders in the
energy market, particularly for grid operators, energy producers, and
consumers. This study focuses on developing a predictive model leveraging Long
Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to forecast day-ahead electricity prices in
the California energy market. The model incorporates a variety of features,
including historical price data, weather conditions, and the energy generation
mix. A novel custom loss function that integrates Mean Absolute Error (MAE),
Jensen-Shannon Divergence (JSD), and a smoothness penalty is introduced to
enhance the prediction accuracy and interpretability. Additionally, an online
learning approach is implemented to allow the model to adapt to new data
incrementally, ensuring continuous relevance and accuracy. The results
demonstrate that the custom loss function can improve the model's performance,
aligning predicted prices more closely with actual values, particularly during
peak intervals. Also, the online learning model outperforms other models by
effectively incorporating real-time data, resulting in lower prediction error
and variability. The inclusion of the energy generation mix further enhances
the model's predictive capabilities, highlighting the importance of
comprehensive feature integration. This research provides a robust framework
for electricity price forecasting, offering valuable insights and tools for
better decision-making in dynamic electricity markets.

Abstract: The effectiveness of artificial intelligence (AI) in healthcare is
significantly hindered by unstructured clinical documentation, which results in
noisy, inconsistent, and logically fragmented training data. To address this
challenge, we present a knowledge-driven framework that integrates the
standardized clinical terminology SNOMED CT with the Neo4j graph database to
construct a structured medical knowledge graph. In this graph, clinical
entities such as diseases, symptoms, and medications are represented as nodes,
and semantic relationships such as ``caused by,'' ``treats,'' and ``belongs
to'' are modeled as edges in Neo4j, with types mapped from formal SNOMED CT
relationship concepts (e.g., \texttt{Causative agent}, \texttt{Indicated for}).
This design enables multi-hop reasoning and ensures terminological consistency.
By extracting and standardizing entity-relationship pairs from clinical texts,
we generate structured, JSON-formatted datasets that embed explicit diagnostic
pathways. These datasets are used to fine-tune large language models (LLMs),
significantly improving the clinical logic consistency of their outputs.
Experimental results demonstrate that our knowledge-guided approach enhances
the validity and interpretability of AI-generated diagnostic reasoning,
providing a scalable solution for building reliable AI-assisted clinical
systems.

challenged teams to predict next-day power demand using real-world
high-frequency data. We proposed a robust yet lightweight Deep Learning (DL)
pipeline combining hourly downsizing, dual-mode imputation (mean and polynomial
regression), and comprehensive normalization, ultimately selecting Standard
Scaling for optimal balance. The lightweight GRU-LSTM sequence-to-one model
achieves an average RMSE of 601.9~W, MAE of 468.9~W, and 84.36\% accuracy.
Despite asymmetric inputs and imputed gaps, it generalized well, captured
nonlinear demand patterns, and maintained low inference latency. Notably,
spatiotemporal heatmap analysis reveals a strong alignment between temperature
trends and predicted consumption, further reinforcing the model's reliability.
These results demonstrate that targeted preprocessing paired with compact
recurrent architectures can still enable fast, accurate, and deployment-ready
energy forecasting in real-world conditions.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了领域泛化持续学习(DGCL)新设置，开发了自适应领域变换(DoT)方法，通过解耦语义和领域信息来提升模型在连续任务中的跨领域泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有持续学习方法通常假设训练和测试领域相同，在真实动态环境中表现不佳。需要模型能够持续学习新技能并泛化到未见过的领域。

Method: 提出自适应领域变换(DoT)，基于分布式加枢纽理论，解耦语义和领域相关信息，自适应地跨领域变换任务表示以实现输出对齐。

Result: DoT作为插件策略显著提升了现有持续学习基线方法在DGCL中的表现，在完全参数调优和参数高效调优范式下都有效，且能积累领域泛化知识。

Conclusion: DoT方法在领域泛化持续学习设置中表现出色，通过轻量级实现确保了资源效率，为动态环境中的智能系统提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: To adapt effectively to dynamic real-world environments, intelligent systems
must continually acquire new skills while generalizing them to diverse, unseen
scenarios. Here, we introduce a novel and realistic setting named domain
generalizable continual learning (DGCL): a model learns sequential tasks with
each involving a single domain, aiming to perform well across all encountered
tasks and domains. This setting poses unique challenges in acquiring,
retaining, and leveraging both semantic- and domain-relevant information for
robust generalization. Although state-of-the-art continual learning (CL)
methods have employed pre-trained models (PTMs) to enhance task-specific
generalization, they typically assume identical training and testing domains
for each task and therefore perform poorly in DGCL. To this end, we propose
adaptive Domain Transformation (DoT), an innovative PTMs-based approach
tailored to DGCL. Inspired by the distributed-plus-hub theory of the human
brain, DoT disentangles semantic- and domain-relevant information in
representation learning, and adaptively transforms task representations across
various domains for output alignment, ensuring balanced and generalized
predictions. DoT serves as a plug-in strategy that greatly facilitates
state-of-the-art CL baselines under both full parameter tuning and
parameter-efficient tuning paradigms in DGCL, validated by extensive
experiments. Also, DoT is shown to accumulate domain-generalizable knowledge
from DGCL, and ensure resource efficiency with a lightweight implementation.

TL;DR: SolverLLM是一个无需训练、基于测试时扩展的框架，通过生成数学公式并将其转换为求解器代码来解决多样化优化问题，采用改进的蒙特卡洛树搜索策略实现强泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法要么依赖提示工程导致跨问题类型泛化能力差，要么需要昂贵的监督训练，需要一种既能解决多样化优化问题又无需额外训练的方法。

Method: 使用改进的蒙特卡洛树搜索策略：动态扩展用于自适应公式生成，提示反向传播通过结果驱动反馈指导探索，不确定性反向传播将奖励可靠性纳入决策过程。

Result: 在六个标准基准数据集上的实验表明，SolverLLM在性能上优于基于提示和基于学习的基线方法。

Conclusion: SolverLLM无需额外训练即可实现强大的泛化能力，为使用大语言模型解决优化问题提供了有效的训练免费框架。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) offer promising capabilities for tackling
complex reasoning tasks, including optimization problems. However, existing
methods either rely on prompt engineering, which leads to poor generalization
across problem types, or require costly supervised training. We introduce
SolverLLM, a training-free framework that leverages test-time scaling to solve
diverse optimization problems. Rather than solving directly, SolverLLM
generates mathematical formulations and translates them into solver-ready code,
guided by a novel Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) strategy. To enhance the
search process, we modify classical MCTS with (1) dynamic expansion for
adaptive formulation generation, (2) prompt backpropagation to guide
exploration via outcome-driven feedback, and (3) uncertainty backpropagation to
incorporate reward reliability into decision-making. Experiments on six
standard benchmark datasets demonstrate that SolverLLM outperforms both
prompt-based and learning-based baselines, achieving strong generalization
without additional training.

Method: 推导显式的二阶表达式，扩展Hessian理论到完整Transformer架构，提出基于泰勒展开的损失差异分析框架。

Result: 建立了完整Transformer块的Hessian表征，揭示了各子层在曲率传播中的作用，为收敛动态和缩放定律提供了理论依据。

Conclusion: 通过将Hessian理论扩展到完整Transformer架构，为大规模深度学习优化的理论和实证研究建立了新基础。

Abstract: The lack of theoretical results for Layer Normalization and feedforward
Hessians has left a gap in the study of Transformer optimization landscapes. We
address this by deriving explicit second-order expressions for these
components, thereby completing the Hessian characterization of full Transformer
blocks. Our results generalize prior self-attention analyses and yield
estimations for the role of each sublayer in curvature propagation. We
demonstrate how these Hessian structures inform both convergence dynamics and
the empirical scaling laws governing large-model performance. Further, we
propose a Taylor-expansion-based framework for analyzing loss differences to
quantify convergence trajectories. By extending Hessian theory to the full
Transformer architecture, this work establishes a new foundation for
theoretical and empirical investigations of optimization in large-scale deep
learning.

TL;DR: P-KAN是一种概率性Kolmogorov-Arnold网络，用于时间序列预测，通过样条函数连接和直接参数化预测分布，在卫星流量预测中优于MLP基准模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发参数高效且能捕捉非线性和重尾动态的概率预测模型，用于卫星通信等资源受限领域的资源分配决策。

Method: 将标量权重替换为基于样条的函数连接，直接参数化预测分布（高斯分布和Student-t分布），构建概率性KAN模型。

Result: P-KAN在准确性和校准方面均优于多层感知机基准，使用更少参数实现更好的效率-风险权衡；高斯变体提供稳健预测，Student-t变体在稳定需求下产生更尖锐分布。

Conclusion: P-KAN为概率预测提供了强大框架，特别适用于卫星通信和其他资源受限领域。

Abstract: This work introduces Probabilistic Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (P-KAN), a novel
probabilistic extension of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) for time series
forecasting. By replacing scalar weights with spline-based functional
connections and directly parameterizing predictive distributions, P-KANs offer
expressive yet parameter-efficient models capable of capturing nonlinear and
heavy-tailed dynamics. We evaluate P-KANs on satellite traffic forecasting,
where uncertainty-aware predictions enable dynamic thresholding for resource
allocation. Results show that P-KANs consistently outperform Multi Layer
Perceptron (MLP) baselines in both accuracy and calibration, achieving superior
efficiency-risk trade-offs while using significantly fewer parameters. We build
up P-KANs on two distributions, namely Gaussian and Student-t distributions.
The Gaussian variant provides robust, conservative forecasts suitable for
safety-critical scenarios, whereas the Student-t variant yields sharper
distributions that improve efficiency under stable demand. These findings
establish P-KANs as a powerful framework for probabilistic forecasting with
direct applicability to satellite communications and other resource-constrained
domains.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一个组件级评估框架，用于评估LLM生成的数学优化公式，超越了传统的整体评估方法，引入了决策变量和约束的精确率/召回率、约束和目标函数的RMSE等指标。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前评估方法通常将优化公式视为整体，依赖解决方案准确性或运行时间等粗略指标，掩盖了结构或数值错误，需要更细粒度的评估框架。

Method: 开发了包含决策变量和约束的精确率/召回率、约束和目标函数RMSE、基于token使用和延迟的效率指标的综合评估框架，评估了GPT-5、LLaMA 3.1 Instruct和DeepSeek Math在不同复杂度优化问题下的六种提示策略。

Result: GPT-5持续优于其他模型，思维链、自一致性和模块化提示最有效。求解器性能主要取决于高约束召回率和低约束RMSE，约束精确率和决策变量指标起次要作用，简洁输出提高计算效率。

Conclusion: 提出了NLP到优化建模的三个原则：(i)完整约束覆盖防止违规，(ii)最小化约束RMSE确保求解器级准确性，(iii)简洁输出提高计算效率。该框架为LLM在优化建模中的细粒度诊断评估奠定了基础。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to convert natural
language descriptions into mathematical optimization formulations. Current
evaluations often treat formulations as a whole, relying on coarse metrics like
solution accuracy or runtime, which obscure structural or numerical errors. In
this study, we present a comprehensive, component-level evaluation framework
for LLM-generated formulations. Beyond the conventional optimality gap, our
framework introduces metrics such as precision and recall for decision
variables and constraints, constraint and objective root mean squared error
(RMSE), and efficiency indicators based on token usage and latency. We evaluate
GPT-5, LLaMA 3.1 Instruct, and DeepSeek Math across optimization problems of
varying complexity under six prompting strategies. Results show that GPT-5
consistently outperforms other models, with chain-of-thought, self-consistency,
and modular prompting proving most effective. Analysis indicates that solver
performance depends primarily on high constraint recall and low constraint
RMSE, which together ensure structural correctness and solution reliability.
Constraint precision and decision variable metrics play secondary roles, while
concise outputs enhance computational efficiency. These findings highlight
three principles for NLP-to-optimization modeling: (i) Complete constraint
coverage prevents violations, (ii) minimizing constraint RMSE ensures
solver-level accuracy, and (iii) concise outputs improve computational
efficiency. The proposed framework establishes a foundation for fine-grained,
diagnostic evaluation of LLMs in optimization modeling.

Motivation: 改进次季节预报中从大尺度大气预测因子回归地表风速时的空间不确定性表示，传统基于模型残差的随机扰动方法无法充分表示空间相关性和物理一致性。

Method: 使用ERA5再分析数据训练三种概率深度学习方法：直接建模分布分位数的分位数回归神经网络、利用潜在空间采样的变分自编码器、采用迭代去噪的扩散模型，并将这些模型应用于ECMWF次季节后报数据。

Result: 概率降尺度方法相比简单随机方法提供更真实的空间不确定性表示，每种概率模型在集合离散度、确定性技能和物理一致性方面各有优势。

Conclusion: 概率降尺度是增强业务次季节风场预报的有效方法，对可再生能源规划和风险评估具有重要意义。

Abstract: This study aims to improve the spatial representation of uncertainties when
regressing surface wind speeds from large-scale atmospheric predictors for
sub-seasonal forecasting. Sub-seasonal forecasting often relies on large-scale
atmospheric predictors such as 500 hPa geopotential height (Z500), which
exhibit higher predictability than surface variables and can be downscaled to
obtain more localised information. Previous work by Tian et al. (2024)
demonstrated that stochastic perturbations based on model residuals can improve
ensemble dispersion representation in statistical downscaling frameworks, but
this method fails to represent spatial correlations and physical consistency
adequately. More sophisticated approaches are needed to capture the complex
relationships between large-scale predictors and local-scale predictands while
maintaining physical consistency. Probabilistic deep learning models offer
promising solutions for capturing complex spatial dependencies. This study
evaluates three probabilistic methods with distinct uncertainty quantification
mechanisms: Quantile Regression Neural Network that directly models
distribution quantiles, Variational Autoencoders that leverage latent space
sampling, and Diffusion Models that utilise iterative denoising. These models
are trained on ERA5 reanalysis data and applied to ECMWF sub-seasonal hindcasts
to regress probabilistic wind speed ensembles. Our results show that
probabilistic downscaling approaches provide more realistic spatial uncertainty
representations compared to simpler stochastic methods, with each probabilistic
model offering different strengths in terms of ensemble dispersion,
deterministic skill, and physical consistency. These findings establish
probabilistic downscaling as an effective enhancement to operational
sub-seasonal wind forecasts for renewable energy planning and risk assessment.

Motivation: 现有基于自身份或输出相似性的KD检测方法容易被提示工程规避，需要更鲁棒的检测机制来保护知识产权和维持LLM多样性。

Method: 利用MoE模型的结构习惯（特别是内部路由模式）作为检测信号，提出Shadow-MoE方法在black-box设置下构建代理MoE表示来比较模型间的模式差异。

Result: 在多种场景下达到超过94%的检测准确率，对基于提示的规避攻击具有强鲁棒性，显著优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: MoE结构习惯在知识蒸馏过程中会持续传递，可作为有效的检测指纹，为LLM知识产权保护和多样性维护提供了新思路。

Abstract: Knowledge Distillation (KD) accelerates training of large language models
(LLMs) but poses intellectual property protection and LLM diversity risks.
Existing KD detection methods based on self-identity or output similarity can
be easily evaded through prompt engineering. We present a KD detection
framework effective in both white-box and black-box settings by exploiting an
overlooked signal: the transfer of MoE "structural habits", especially internal
routing patterns. Our approach analyzes how different experts specialize and
collaborate across various inputs, creating distinctive fingerprints that
persist through the distillation process. To extend beyond the white-box setup
and MoE architectures, we further propose Shadow-MoE, a black-box method that
constructs proxy MoE representations via auxiliary distillation to compare
these patterns between arbitrary model pairs. We establish a comprehensive,
reproducible benchmark that offers diverse distilled checkpoints and an
extensible framework to facilitate future research. Extensive experiments
demonstrate >94% detection accuracy across various scenarios and strong
robustness to prompt-based evasion, outperforming existing baselines while
highlighting the structural habits transfer in LLMs.

Motivation: 社会科学中常见中小规模连续数据，现有差分隐私线性回归方法主要关注点估计，缺乏不确定性量化和合成数据生成支持，而主流合成数据方法不适合连续回归数据或需要大数据集。

Method: 使用高斯差分隐私下的偏差校正估计器，提供渐近置信区间，并通过分箱聚合策略实现合成数据生成，使合成数据上的回归与差分隐私回归结果一致。

Result: 实验表明该方法(1)相比现有方法提高准确性，(2)提供有效置信区间，(3)生成的合成数据在下游机器学习任务中比现有差分隐私合成数据生成方法更可靠。

Conclusion: 该方法为社会科学中的中小规模连续数据提供了在差分隐私下进行线性回归推断和合成数据生成的有效解决方案。

Abstract: In social sciences, small- to medium-scale datasets are common and linear
regression (LR) is canonical. In privacy-aware settings, much work has focused
on differentially private (DP) LR, but mostly on point estimation with limited
attention to uncertainty quantification. Meanwhile, synthetic data generation
(SDG) is increasingly important for reproducibility studies, yet current DP LR
methods do not readily support it. Mainstream SDG approaches are either
tailored to discretized data, making them less suitable for continuous
regression, or rely on deep models that require large datasets, limiting their
use for the smaller, continuous data typical in social science. We propose a
method for LR with valid inference under Gaussian DP: a DP bias-corrected
estimator with asymptotic confidence intervals (CIs) and a general SDG
procedure in which regression on the synthetic data matches our DP regression.
Our binning-aggregation strategy is effective in small- to moderate-dimensional
settings. Experiments show our method (1) improves accuracy over existing
methods, (2) provides valid CIs, and (3) produces more reliable synthetic data
for downstream ML tasks than current DP SDGs.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出MuonBP优化器，在保持Muon优化器数据效率优势的同时，通过分块周期性正交化减少模型并行训练中的通信开销，实现8%的吞吐量提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Muon优化器结合梯度正交化和一阶动量，在语言模型训练中比Adam/AdamW有更好的数据效率，但在模型并行环境下，梯度正交化需要额外的通信操作，导致5%-10%的吞吐量损失。

Method: 提出MuonBP方法，在每个设备上独立对矩阵分块进行正交化，并周期性执行完全正交化以保持训练稳定性。使用两个学习率：一个用于分块正交化步骤，一个用于完全正交化步骤。

Result: 在8B模型训练中，使用8路张量并行和ZeRO优化器状态分片，MuonBP相比Muon实现了8%的吞吐量提升，且性能没有下降。

Conclusion: MuonBP方法简单，需要最少的超参数调整，在保持Muon迭代复杂度的同时，实现了与AdamW等坐标方法相当的每轮迭代吞吐量。

Abstract: Gradient orthogonalization is a simple strategy that shows great utility in
speeding up gradient descent. The Muon optimizer (Jordan, Jin, et al., 2024)
combines gradient orthogonalization with first-order momentum and achieves
significant improvement in data efficiency over Adam/AdamW (Loshchilov and
Hutter, 2019) for language model training. However, when using model
parallelism, gradient orthogonalization introduces additional overhead compared
to coordinate-wise optimizers (such as AdamW) due to additional gather and
scatter operations on gradient matrix shards from different devices. This
additional communication can amount to a throughput hit of 5%-10% compared to
Adam/AdamW. To remedy this, we propose Muon with Block-Periodic
Orthogonalization (MuonBP), which applies orthogonalization independently to
matrix shards on each device and periodically performs full orthogonalization
to maintain training stability at scale. We show how to adjust the learning
rate from the baseline to MuonBP and give convergence guarantees for this
algorithm. Crucially, our theory dictates that we use two stepsizes: one for
the blockwise orthogonalization steps, and one for the full orthogonalization
steps. Our method is simple, requires minimal hyperparameter adjustments, and
achieves competitive iteration complexity compared with baseline Muon while
providing per-iteration throughput comparable to coordinate-wise methods such
as AdamW. When training an 8B model with eight-way tensor parallelism and ZeRO
optimizer state sharding, MuonBP achieves 8% throughput increase compared to
Muon with no degradation in performance.

Motivation: 现实世界多模态数据具有复杂的结构关系，而现有方法未能区分多跳邻居并将图视为独立模态，这限制了整体理解能力。

Method: 提出Hop-Diffused Attention通过因果掩码和跳扩散整合多跳结构信息，设计MM-QFormer进行跨模态融合。

Result: 在生成和判别任务上优于更大的视觉语言模型、大语言模型和多模态图基线方法，平均提升6.93%。

Conclusion: 利用结构信息整合模态内和模态间交互，能够超越将图作为独立模态的方法，提升多模态理解能力。

Abstract: Real-world multimodal data usually exhibit complex structural relationships
beyond traditional one-to-one mappings like image-caption pairs. Entities
across modalities interact in intricate ways, with images and text forming
diverse interconnections through contextual dependencies and co-references.
Graphs provide powerful structural information for modeling intra-modal and
inter-modal relationships. However, previous works fail to distinguish
multi-hop neighbors and treat the graph as a standalone modality, which
fragments the overall understanding. This limitation presents two key
challenges in multimodal learning: (1) integrating structural information from
multi-hop neighbors into foundational models, and (2) fusing modality-specific
information in a principled manner. To address these challenges, we revisit the
role of graphs in multimodal learning within the era of foundation models and
propose Graph4MM, a graph-based multimodal learning framework. To be specific,
we introduce Hop-Diffused Attention, which integrates multi-hop structural
information into self-attention through causal masking and hop diffusion.
Furthermore, we design MM-QFormer, a multi-mapping querying transformer for
cross-modal fusion. Through theoretical and empirical analysis, we show that
leveraging structures to integrate both intra- and inter-modal interactions
improves multimodal understanding beyond treating them as a standalone
modality. Experiments on both generative and discriminative tasks show that
Graph4MM outperforms larger VLMs, LLMs, and multimodal graph baselines,
achieving a 6.93% average improvement.

Motivation: 电路原理图在模拟集成电路设计中至关重要，但现有基于大语言模型的方法主要依赖SPICE网表等文本表示，缺乏对电路设计师的视觉可解释性。

Method: 采用多模态大语言模型，整合文本、视觉和符号模态，使用6个模拟子结构示例进行少样本布局，并通过视觉思维链策略迭代优化布局和布线。

Conclusion: EEschematic能够有效生成高质量、可编辑的电路原理图，为电路设计提供了更好的视觉理解和验证工具。

Abstract: Circuit schematics play a crucial role in analog integrated circuit design,
serving as the primary medium for human understanding and verification of
circuit functionality. While recent large language model (LLM)-based approaches
have shown promise in circuit topology generation and device sizing, most rely
solely on textual representations such as SPICE netlists, which lack visual
interpretability for circuit designers. To address this limitation, we propose
EEschematic, an AI agent for automatic analog schematic generation based on a
Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM). EEschematic integrates textual, visual,
and symbolic modalities to translate SPICE netlists into schematic diagrams
represented in a human-editable format. The framework uses six analog
substructure examples for few-shot placement and a Visual Chain-of-Thought
(VCoT) strategy to iteratively refine placement and wiring, enhancing schematic
clarity and symmetry. Experimental results on representative analog circuits,
including a CMOS inverter, a five-transistor operational transconductance
amplifier (5T-OTA), and a telescopic cascode amplifier, demonstrate that
EEschematic produces schematics with high visual quality and structural
correctness.

Motivation: 在LLM时代，需要运行一系列LLM推理来解决实际问题。当在共享GPU服务器上服务这些应用时，调度器需要在保证最坏情况性能的同时实现快速应用完成。主流LLM调度器由于队头阻塞或资源分配过紧而表现不佳。

Method: 设计Justitia调度器，采用三种关键技术：1) 以内存为中心建模LLM应用的服务成本；2) 使用简单神经网络模型进行轻量级准确的需求预测；3) 采用基于虚拟时间的公平排队算法来降低总体性能并保证最坏情况延迟。

Result: 在vLLM上实现Justitia，涉及多样化LLM应用的实验结果显示，它能在保持公平性的同时显著提升调度效率。

Conclusion: Justitia调度器能够有效解决LLM应用在共享GPU环境中的调度问题，实现公平且高效的服务。

Abstract: In the era of Large Language Models (LLMs), it has been popular to launch a
series of LLM inferences -- we call an LLM application -- to better solve
real-world problems. When serving those applications in shared GPU servers, the
schedulers are expected to attain fast application completions with guaranteed
worst-case performance. However, mainstream LLM schedulers fail to behave well
for LLM applications -- due to head-of-line blocking or over-constrained
resource allocation. In this paper, we propose to serve LLM applications in a
fair and also efficient manner. To this end, we design Justitia, a novel
scheduler with three key techniques. First, given that memory is prevalently a
bottleneck for mainstream inference frameworks like vLLM, Justitia models the
service cost of LLM applications in a memory-centric manner. Meanwhile, it uses
a simple neural network model to conduct light-weight and also accurate demand
prediction. Moreover, Justitia adopts a virtual-time based fair queuing
algorithm to reduce the overall performance with guaranteed worst-case delay.
We have implemented Justitia atop vLLM, and experimental results involving
diverse LLM applications show that it can substantially enhance the scheduling
efficiency with fairness preserved.

Method: 通过将触发器放置在注意力下沉位置并调整其注意力值来增强后门持久性，利用LLM中浅层输入token持续吸引不成比例注意力的现象。

Result: 实验验证了注意力下沉引导的后门遗忘攻击能可靠地在触发器存在时恢复被遗忘知识，而在无触发器时与正常遗忘模型无法区分。

Conclusion: 注意力下沉现象为后门遗忘攻击提供了有效通道，这种攻击对LLM安全构成严重威胁，需要在遗忘机制设计中加以防范。

Abstract: Large language model (LLM) unlearning has become a critical mechanism for
removing undesired data, knowledge, or behaviors from pre-trained models while
retaining their general utility. Yet, with the rise of open-weight LLMs, we
ask: can the unlearning process itself be backdoored, appearing successful
under normal conditions yet reverting to pre-unlearned behavior when a hidden
trigger is activated? Drawing inspiration from classical backdoor attacks that
embed triggers into training data to enforce specific behaviors, we investigate
backdoor unlearning, where models forget as intended in the clean setting but
recover forgotten knowledge when the trigger appears. We show that designing
such attacks presents unique challenges, hinging on where triggers are placed
and how backdoor training is reinforced. We uncover a strong link between
backdoor efficacy and the attention sink phenomenon, i.e., shallow input tokens
consistently attract disproportionate attention in LLMs. Our analysis reveals
that these attention sinks serve as gateways for backdoor unlearning: placing
triggers at sink positions and aligning their attention values markedly
enhances backdoor persistence. Extensive experiments validate these findings,
showing that attention-sink-guided backdoor unlearning reliably restores
forgotten knowledge in the presence of backdoor triggers, while behaving
indistinguishably from a normally unlearned model when triggers are absent.

TL;DR: 提出PIMMA框架解决服务质量降级问题，通过生成式方法合成可行解，在非线性边权重函数场景下优于传统方法


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法无法直接处理非线性边权重函数的QoSD问题，传统组合优化方法受限，ML方法只能处理小规模线性变体

Method: 三阶段框架：Forge阶段使用预测路径应力算法生成可行解；Morph阶段训练条件变分自编码器捕获解特征分布；Refine阶段用强化学习探索空间生成近优解

Result: 在合成和真实网络上的实验表明，该方法在非线性成本函数场景下始终优于经典和ML基线方法

Conclusion: PIMMA框架有效解决了非线性边权重函数的QoSD问题，填补了现有方法的空白

Abstract: We study the Quality of Service Degradation (QoSD) problem, in which an
adversary perturbs edge weights to degrade network performance. This setting
arises in both network infrastructures and distributed ML systems, where
communication quality, not just connectivity, determines functionality. While
classical methods rely on combinatorial optimization, and recent ML approaches
address only restricted linear variants with small-size networks, no prior
model directly tackles the QoSD problem under nonlinear edge-weight functions.
This work proposes \PIMMA, a self-reinforcing generative framework that
synthesizes feasible solutions in latent space, to fill this gap. Our method
includes three phases: (1) Forge: a Predictive Path-Stressing (PPS) algorithm
that uses graph learning and approximation to produce feasible solutions with
performance guarantee, (2) Morph: a new theoretically grounded training
paradigm for Mixture of Conditional VAEs guided by an energy-based model to
capture solution feature distributions, and (3) Refine: a reinforcement
learning agent that explores this space to generate progressively near-optimal
solutions using our designed differentiable reward function. Experiments on
both synthetic and real-world networks show that our approach consistently
outperforms classical and ML baselines, particularly in scenarios with
nonlinear cost functions where traditional methods fail to generalize.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决非线性独立成分分析中潜在成分识别的挑战，传统方法依赖辅助信号或结构假设，需要更通用的识别方法。

Method: 使用雅可比体积最大化(J-VolMax)准则，利用混合函数雅可比矩阵的凸几何特性，通过鼓励潜在成分对观测变量的影响多样性来实现识别。

Result: 在合理条件下实现了潜在成分的可识别性，无需依赖辅助信息、潜在成分独立性或雅可比稀疏性假设。

Conclusion: DICA框架扩展了可识别性分析的范围，为现有方法提供了补充视角，在非线性混合问题中实现了更通用的潜在成分识别。

Abstract: Latent component identification from unknown nonlinear mixtures is a
foundational challenge in machine learning, with applications in tasks such as
disentangled representation learning and causal inference. Prior work in
nonlinear independent component analysis (nICA) has shown that auxiliary
signals -- such as weak supervision -- can support identifiability of
conditionally independent latent components. More recent approaches explore
structural assumptions, e.g., sparsity in the Jacobian of the mixing function,
to relax such requirements. In this work, we introduce Diverse Influence
Component Analysis (DICA), a framework that exploits the convex geometry of the
mixing function's Jacobian. We propose a Jacobian Volume Maximization
(J-VolMax) criterion, which enables latent component identification by
encouraging diversity in their influence on the observed variables. Under
reasonable conditions, this approach achieves identifiability without relying
on auxiliary information, latent component independence, or Jacobian sparsity
assumptions. These results extend the scope of identifiability analysis and
offer a complementary perspective to existing methods.

Motivation: 探究当后置指令与模型已学习行为冲突时，模型的推理过程会发生什么变化，以及动机性推理对CoT监控的影响。

Method: 在简单设置中研究模型行为，分析动机性推理的特征，并测试不同规模LLM对这种推理的检测能力。

Result: 模型会系统性地进行动机性推理，前沿推理模型能检测大部分此类行为，但小型LLM检测器可能失效甚至被说服。

Conclusion: 随着模型更复杂，动机性推理可能更难检测，需要在依赖CoT进行模型评估和监督时考虑这一现象。

Abstract: The use of reinforcement learning (RL) with chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning
has emerged as a promising approach for developing more capable language
models. In turn, this has led to investigation of CoT monitoring as a
compelling method for detecting harmful behaviors such as reward hacking, under
the assumption that models' reasoning processes reflect their internal
decision-making. In practice, LLM training often produces unintended behaviors
due to imperfect reward signals, leading models to develop misaligned
tendencies. A common corrective approach is to apply post-hoc instructions to
avoid problematic behaviors like sycophancy, but what happens to the model's
reasoning process when these instructions conflict with learned behaviors? We
investigate this question in simple settings and find that models engage in
systematic motivated reasoning -- generating plausible-sounding justifications
for violating their instructions while downplaying potential harms. Beyond
being an interesting property of training, we find that while motivated
reasoning can be detected by most frontier reasoning models, smaller LLM judges
can fail to identify a portion of it, and in rare cases can themselves be
persuaded that the reasoning is correct, despite it contradicting clear
instructions. This capability gap raises concerns that as models become more
sophisticated, their motivated reasoning may become increasingly difficult for
monitors to detect. Our results underscore the need to account for motivated
reasoning when relying on chain-of-thought processes for model evaluation and
oversight. All code for this paper will be made available. WARNING: some
examples in this paper may be upsetting.

Motivation: 虽然量化技术显著降低了深度学习的推理计算成本，但训练仍主要依赖复杂的浮点运算。低精度定点训练是一个有吸引力的替代方案，特别是针对未来硬件加速器设计。

Method: 提出在算术运算近似设计中引入位宽考虑，开发了硬件友好的分段线性近似用于对数加法。使用模拟退火算法在不同精度级别优化该近似，并通过C++位真模拟验证方法。

Conclusion: 该方法证明了低精度对数定点训练在保持模型精度的同时，能够显著降低硬件实现的计算成本和能耗，为未来高效硬件加速器设计提供了可行方案。

Abstract: While advancements in quantization have significantly reduced the
computational costs of inference in deep learning, training still predominantly
relies on complex floating-point arithmetic. Low-precision fixed-point training
presents a compelling alternative. This work introduces a novel enhancement in
low-precision logarithmic fixed-point training, geared towards future hardware
accelerator designs. We propose incorporating bitwidth in the design of
approximations to arithmetic operations. To this end, we introduce a new
hardware-friendly, piece-wise linear approximation for logarithmic addition.
Using simulated annealing, we optimize this approximation at different
precision levels. A C++ bit-true simulation demonstrates training of VGG-11 and
VGG-16 models on CIFAR-100 and TinyImageNet, respectively, using 12-bit integer
arithmetic with minimal accuracy degradation compared to 32-bit floating-point
training. Our hardware study reveals up to 32.5% reduction in area and 53.5%
reduction in energy consumption for the proposed LNS multiply-accumulate units
compared to that of linear fixed-point equivalents.

Motivation: 当前成功的AI模型（如VLMs、LLMs）缺乏明确的动作概念，而纯探索方法无法让智能体快速适应新任务。人类数据提供了强归纳偏置，但存在错误假设——人类大部分时间处于最有奖励的状态。

Method: 训练阶段自动提出目标并练习达成目标，基于强化学习探索的先前工作；评估阶段通过（摊销）逆强化学习问题将演示解释为最优目标达成行为。

Conclusion: 该方法为交互式智能体提供了一种自监督预训练的有效途径，使其能够快速适应新任务并模仿人类演示。

Abstract: In the same way that generative models today conduct most of their training
in a self-supervised fashion, how can agentic models conduct their training in
a self-supervised fashion, interactively exploring, learning, and preparing to
quickly adapt to new tasks? A prerequisite for embodied agents deployed in real
world interactions ought to be training with interaction, yet today's most
successful AI models (e.g., VLMs, LLMs) are trained without an explicit notion
of action. The problem of pure exploration (which assumes no data as input) is
well studied in the reinforcement learning literature and provides agents with
a wide array of experiences, yet it fails to prepare them for rapid adaptation
to new tasks. Today's language and vision models are trained on data provided
by humans, which provides a strong inductive bias for the sorts of tasks that
the model will have to solve (e.g., modeling chords in a song, phrases in a
sonnet, sentences in a medical record). However, when they are prompted to
solve a new task, there is a faulty tacit assumption that humans spend most of
their time in the most rewarding states. The key contribution of our paper is a
method for pre-training interactive agents in a self-supervised fashion, so
that they can instantly mimic human demonstrations. Our method treats goals
(i.e., observations) as the atomic construct. During training, our method
automatically proposes goals and practices reaching them, building off prior
work in reinforcement learning exploration. During evaluation, our method
solves an (amortized) inverse reinforcement learning problem to explain
demonstrations as optimal goal-reaching behavior. Experiments on standard
benchmarks (not designed for goal-reaching) show that our approach outperforms
prior methods for zero-shot imitation.

Motivation: 解决从潜在策略性来源收集的数据集可靠性评估问题，在无法获取真实数据的情况下量化报告数据与真实数据的偏差程度。

Method: 定义了基于真实数据的可靠性排序，提出了Gram行列式评分方法，通过计算观测数据和实验结果的经验分布向量所张成的体积来度量可靠性。

Result: Gram行列式评分能够保持多种基于真实数据的可靠性排序，并且在不同实验条件下产生相同的可靠性排名（实验无关性）。在合成噪声模型、CIFAR-10嵌入和真实就业数据上的实验验证了该方法的有效性。

Conclusion: Gram行列式评分是一种有效的数据集可靠性评估工具，能够在无法获取真实数据的情况下准确捕捉数据质量，且具有实验无关性的重要特性。

Abstract: How can we assess the reliability of a dataset without access to ground
truth? We introduce the problem of reliability scoring for datasets collected
from potentially strategic sources. The true data are unobserved, but we see
outcomes of an unknown statistical experiment that depends on them. To
benchmark reliability, we define ground-truth-based orderings that capture how
much reported data deviate from the truth. We then propose the Gram determinant
score, which measures the volume spanned by vectors describing the empirical
distribution of the observed data and experiment outcomes. We show that this
score preserves several ground-truth based reliability orderings and, uniquely
up to scaling, yields the same reliability ranking of datasets regardless of
the experiment -- a property we term experiment agnosticism. Experiments on
synthetic noise models, CIFAR-10 embeddings, and real employment data
demonstrate that the Gram determinant score effectively captures data quality
across diverse observation processes.

*Zan Li,Rui Fan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种自适应图学习框架，通过专门设计的专家网络检测金融异常，提供内置可解释性，能够识别异常机制类型并追踪其时间演化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有金融异常检测方法将所有异常视为同质，产生标量分数而不揭示具体失效机制、风险集中位置或干预方式，这种不透明性阻碍了针对性监管响应。存在三个未解决问题：静态图结构无法适应市场相关性变化；统一检测机制无法捕捉多时间尺度的类型特定特征；黑盒输出无法提供异常机制及其时间演化的可操作指导。

Method: 通过自适应图学习与专门专家网络构建框架：使用带自注意力的BiLSTM捕捉多尺度时间依赖；通过跨模态注意力融合时空信息；通过神经多源插值学习动态图；通过压力调制融合自适应平衡学习动态与结构先验；将异常路由到四个机制特定专家；产生双级可解释归因。可解释性在架构层面内置而非后处理。

Result: 在100支美国股票（2017-2024）上实现了92.3%的13个主要事件检测率，领先时间3.8天，比最佳基线提高30.8个百分点。硅谷银行案例显示异常演化追踪：价格冲击专家权重在关闭期间升至0.39（比基线0.29高33%），一周后达到峰值0.48（比基线高66%），无需标注监督即可自动识别时间机制。

Conclusion: 该框架通过自适应图学习和机制特定专家网络，成功解决了金融异常检测中的关键挑战，提供了内置可解释性和异常机制识别能力，为针对性监管响应提供了有效工具。

Abstract: Financial anomalies exhibit heterogeneous mechanisms (price shocks, liquidity
freezes, contagion cascades, regime shifts), but existing detectors treat all
anomalies uniformly, producing scalar scores without revealing which mechanism
is failing, where risks concentrate, or how to intervene. This opacity prevents
targeted regulatory responses. Three unsolved challenges persist: (1) static
graph structures cannot adapt when market correlations shift during regime
changes; (2) uniform detection mechanisms miss type-specific signatures across
multiple temporal scales while failing to integrate individual behaviors with
network contagion; (3) black-box outputs provide no actionable guidance on
anomaly mechanisms or their temporal evolution.
  We address these via adaptive graph learning with specialized expert networks
that provide built-in interpretability. Our framework captures multi-scale
temporal dependencies through BiLSTM with self-attention, fuses temporal and
spatial information via cross-modal attention, learns dynamic graphs through
neural multi-source interpolation, adaptively balances learned dynamics with
structural priors via stress-modulated fusion, routes anomalies to four
mechanism-specific experts, and produces dual-level interpretable attributions.
Critically, interpretability is embedded architecturally rather than applied
post-hoc.
  On 100 US equities (2017-2024), we achieve 92.3% detection of 13 major events
with 3.8-day lead time, outperforming best baseline by 30.8pp. Silicon Valley
Bank case study demonstrates anomaly evolution tracking: Price-Shock expert
weight rose to 0.39 (33% above baseline 0.29) during closure, peaking at 0.48
(66% above baseline) one week later, revealing automatic temporal mechanism
identification without labeled supervision.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究Hedge算法在组合设置中的最优性，探索其在各种组合问题中的性能边界，包括扩展形式博弈、资源分配、m-集合、在线多任务学习和DAG最短路径问题。

Method: 通过建立下界分析Hedge算法的最优性，识别特定组合类别（如m-集合）进行精确分析，并利用Hedge的近最优性为DAG最短路径问题构造近最优正则化器。

Result: 证明Hedge算法对于任意组合集X ⊆ {0,1}^d都是近最优的（最多相差√log d因子），但在log d ≤ m ≤ √d的m-集合中，Hedge存在√log d的次优性差距。同时证明Hedge在在线多任务学习中是最优的。

Conclusion: Hedge算法在组合设置中具有普遍近最优性，虽然在某些特定设置下存在次优性，但其性能边界为设计组合在线学习算法提供了重要指导，特别是在DAG最短路径问题中建立了近最优正则化方法。

Abstract: In this paper, we study the classical Hedge algorithm in combinatorial
settings. In each round, the learner selects a vector $\boldsymbol{x}_t$ from a
set $X \subseteq \{0,1\}^d$, observes a full loss vector $\boldsymbol{y}_t \in
\mathbb{R}^d$, and incurs a loss $\langle \boldsymbol{x}_t, \boldsymbol{y}_t
\rangle \in [-1,1]$. This setting captures several important problems,
including extensive-form games, resource allocation, $m$-sets, online multitask
learning, and shortest-path problems on directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). It is
well known that Hedge achieves a regret of $O\big(\sqrt{T \log |X|}\big)$ after
$T$ rounds of interaction. In this paper, we ask whether Hedge is optimal
across all combinatorial settings. To that end, we show that for any $X
\subseteq \{0,1\}^d$, Hedge is near-optimal--specifically, up to a $\sqrt{\log
d}$ factor--by establishing a lower bound of $\Omega\big(\sqrt{T \log(|X|)/\log
d}\big)$ that holds for any algorithm. We then identify a natural class of
combinatorial sets--namely, $m$-sets with $\log d \leq m \leq \sqrt{d}$--for
which this lower bound is tight, and for which Hedge is provably suboptimal by
a factor of exactly $\sqrt{\log d}$. At the same time, we show that Hedge is
optimal for online multitask learning, a generalization of the classical
$K$-experts problem. Finally, we leverage the near-optimality of Hedge to
establish the existence of a near-optimal regularizer for online shortest-path
problems in DAGs--a setting that subsumes a broad range of combinatorial
domains. Specifically, we show that the classical Online Mirror Descent (OMD)
algorithm, when instantiated with the dilated entropy regularizer, is
iterate-equivalent to Hedge, and therefore inherits its near-optimal regret
guarantees for DAGs.

Motivation: 现有研究主要关注最坏情况分析，而本文旨在开发能够在随机和对抗环境中都表现良好的BOBW算法，以应对聚合赌博机反馈这一更具挑战性的设置。

Method: 结合了基于占用度量的FTRL、自边界技术以及受在线最短路径问题启发的新型损失估计器，并针对未知转移情况引入了置信度技术。

Result: 在已知转移概率时，算法在随机环境中达到O(log T)遗憾，在对抗环境中达到O(√T)遗憾；在未知转移情况下也能保持良好性能，并建立了匹配的下界证明最优性。

Conclusion: 本文首次为聚合赌博机反馈下的表格MDP提供了BOBW算法，证明了其最优性，并为最短路径问题提供了首个个体间隙相关的下界和近最优算法。

Abstract: We study online learning in finite-horizon episodic Markov decision processes
(MDPs) under the challenging aggregate bandit feedback model, where the learner
observes only the cumulative loss incurred in each episode, rather than
individual losses at each state-action pair. While prior work in this setting
has focused exclusively on worst-case analysis, we initiate the study of
best-of-both-worlds (BOBW) algorithms that achieve low regret in both
stochastic and adversarial environments. We propose the first BOBW algorithms
for episodic tabular MDPs with aggregate bandit feedback. In the case of known
transitions, our algorithms achieve $O(\log T)$ regret in stochastic settings
and ${O}(\sqrt{T})$ regret in adversarial ones. Importantly, we also establish
matching lower bounds, showing the optimality of our algorithms in this
setting. We further extend our approach to unknown-transition settings by
incorporating confidence-based techniques. Our results rely on a combination of
FTRL over occupancy measures, self-bounding techniques, and new loss estimators
inspired by recent advances in online shortest path problems. Along the way, we
also provide the first individual-gap-dependent lower bounds and demonstrate
near-optimal BOBW algorithms for shortest path problems with bandit feedback.

Motivation: 虽然Transformer在时间序列建模中取得了显著成功，但其内部机制仍然不透明。本文旨在通过建立Transformer编码器与图卷积网络的基本等价关系来揭示其工作机制。

Method: 将注意力分布矩阵视为动态邻接矩阵，证明其与后续变换的组合执行类似图卷积的计算。在反向传播中，值和前馈投影的更新动态与GCN参数更新相似。基于此理论重构提出Fighter架构，移除冗余线性投影并引入多跳图聚合。

Result: 在标准预测基准测试中，Fighter实现了具有竞争力的性能，同时为其预测提供了更清晰的机制可解释性。

Conclusion: Transformer编码器在本质上等价于图卷积网络，这种统一的理论重构不仅提供了对时间序列依赖关系的显式和可解释表示，还启发了更高效和可解释的架构设计。

Abstract: Transformers have achieved remarkable success in time series modeling, yet
their internal mechanisms remain opaque. This work demystifies the Transformer
encoder by establishing its fundamental equivalence to a Graph Convolutional
Network (GCN). We show that in the forward pass, the attention distribution
matrix serves as a dynamic adjacency matrix, and its composition with
subsequent transformations performs computations analogous to graph
convolution. Moreover, we demonstrate that in the backward pass, the update
dynamics of value and feed-forward projections mirror those of GCN parameters.
Building on this unified theoretical reinterpretation, we propose
\textbf{Fighter} (Flexible Graph Convolutional Transformer), a streamlined
architecture that removes redundant linear projections and incorporates
multi-hop graph aggregation. This perspective yields an explicit and
interpretable representation of temporal dependencies across different scales,
naturally expressed as graph edges. Experiments on standard forecasting
benchmarks confirm that Fighter achieves competitive performance while
providing clearer mechanistic interpretability of its predictions.

Motivation: 传统自编码器缺乏对码空间分布的有效约束，需要一种能够确保码矩阵具有高斯分布特性的正则化方法，以提高模型的泛化性能。

Method: 定义基于码矩阵奇异值的可微损失函数，通过最小化负矩阵自由能使码矩阵奇异值分布与高斯随机矩阵一致，使用随机梯度下降进行训练。

Conclusion: 矩阵自由能正则化是自编码器训练的有效方法，能够可靠生成高斯码并改善模型泛化能力。

Abstract: We introduce a novel regularization scheme for autoencoders based on
matricial free energy. Our approach defines a differentiable loss function in
terms of the singular values of the code matrix (code dimension x batch size).
From the standpoint of free probability an d random matrix theory, this loss
achieves its minimum when the singular value distribution of the code matrix
coincides with that of an appropriately sculpted random metric with i.i.d.
Gaussian entries. Empirical simulations demonstrate that minimizing the
negative matricial free energy through standard stochastic gradient-based
training yields Gaussian-like codes that generalize across training and test
sets. Building on this foundation, we propose a matricidal free energy
maximizing autoencoder that reliably produces Gaussian codes and show its
application to underdetermined inverse problems.

from traditional value function-based approaches, our key contribution is the
characterization of continuous-time Q-functions via a martingale condition and
the linking of diffusion policy scores to the action gradient of a learned
continuous Q-function by the dynamic programming principle. This insight
motivates Continuous Q-Score Matching (CQSM), a score-based policy improvement
algorithm. Notably, our method addresses a long-standing challenge in
continuous-time RL: preserving the action-evaluation capability of Q-functions
without relying on time discretization. We further provide theoretical
closed-form solutions for linear-quadratic (LQ) control problems within our
framework. Numerical results in simulated environments demonstrate the
effectiveness of our proposed method and compare it to popular baselines.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一个评估LLM通过对话发现和利用潜在用户信息的统一基准，包含三个逐步现实的场景，结果显示LLM在这方面的能力差异很大


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM擅长生成通用文本，但在需要用户特定偏好的场景中，用户很少明确表达所有偏好，大部分信息是潜在的，需要被推断

Method: 引入统一基准评估潜在信息发现能力，采用三智能体框架（用户、助手、法官），包含20个问题游戏、个性化问答和个性化文本摘要三个任务

Result: LLM确实可以通过对话发现潜在信息，但成功率差异很大，从32%到98%，取决于任务复杂度、主题和隐藏属性数量

Conclusion: 有效偏好推断仍是构建真正自适应AI系统的开放前沿，该基准为研究个性化交互中的潜在信息发现提供了首个系统框架

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at producing broadly relevant text, but
this generality becomes a limitation when user-specific preferences are
required, such as recommending restaurants or planning travel. In these
scenarios, users rarely articulate every preference explicitly; instead, much
of what they care about remains latent, waiting to be inferred. This raises a
fundamental question: Can LLMs uncover and reason about such latent information
through conversation?
  We address this problem by introducing a unified benchmark for evaluating
latent information discovery - the ability of LLMs to reveal and utilize hidden
user attributes through multi-turn interaction. The benchmark spans three
progressively realistic settings: the classic 20 Questions game, Personalized
Question Answering, and Personalized Text Summarization. All tasks share a
tri-agent framework (User, Assistant, Judge) enabling turn-level evaluation of
elicitation and adaptation. Our results reveal that while LLMs can indeed
surface latent information through dialogue, their success varies dramatically
with context: from 32% to 98%, depending on task complexity, topic, and number
of hidden attributes. This benchmark provides the first systematic framework
for studying latent information discovery in personalized interaction,
highlighting that effective preference inference remains an open frontier for
building truly adaptive AI systems.

TL;DR: 提出In-situ Autoguidance方法，通过模型自身的随机前向传递动态生成劣质预测，实现无需外部组件的自我引导，解决CFG方法在提升质量和对齐度时导致多样性降低的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决分类器无关引导(CFG)方法在提升图像质量和提示对齐度的同时导致多样性降低的问题，避免现有解耦方法需要额外辅助模型的开销。

Method: 使用随机前向传递动态生成劣质预测，将引导重新定义为推理时的自我校正过程，无需任何辅助组件。

Result: 证明这种零成本方法不仅可行，而且为成本高效的引导建立了强大的新基准，实现了无需外部模型的自我引导优势。

Conclusion: In-situ Autoguidance方法成功实现了无需外部辅助模型的自我引导，证明了自我引导的益处可以在不依赖外部模型的情况下达成。

Abstract: The generation of high-quality, diverse, and prompt-aligned images is a
central goal in image-generating diffusion models. The popular classifier-free
guidance (CFG) approach improves quality and alignment at the cost of reduced
variation, creating an inherent entanglement of these effects. Recent work has
successfully disentangled these properties by guiding a model with a separately
trained, inferior counterpart; however, this solution introduces the
considerable overhead of requiring an auxiliary model. We challenge this
prerequisite by introducing In-situ Autoguidance, a method that elicits
guidance from the model itself without any auxiliary components. Our approach
dynamically generates an inferior prediction on the fly using a stochastic
forward pass, reframing guidance as a form of inference-time self-correction.
We demonstrate that this zero-cost approach is not only viable but also
establishes a powerful new baseline for cost-efficient guidance, proving that
the benefits of self-guidance can be achieved without external models.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为ALMD的新学习范式，使模型在部署后能自主检测未见类别样本并进行增量学习，无需人工工程师参与。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统监督学习在部署后模型固定，无法适应动态开放环境中出现的未见类别样本。需要模型能够自主检测新类别并学习。

Method: 提出了PLDA方法，实现动态OOD检测和在线增量学习新类别，解决数据稀缺和资源消耗问题。

Result: 通过实证评估证明了PLDA方法的有效性。

Conclusion: ALMD范式为动态开放环境中的持续学习提供了可行解决方案，PLDA方法能有效应对新类别检测和增量学习的挑战。

Abstract: In classic supervised learning, once a model is deployed in an application,
it is fixed. No updates will be made to it during the application. This is
inappropriate for many dynamic and open environments, where unexpected samples
from unseen classes may appear. In such an environment, the model should be
able to detect these novel samples from unseen classes and learn them after
they are labeled. We call this paradigm Autonomous Learning after Model
Deployment (ALMD). The learning here is continuous and involves no human
engineers. Labeling in this scenario is performed by human co-workers or other
knowledgeable agents, which is similar to what humans do when they encounter an
unfamiliar object and ask another person for its name. In ALMD, the detection
of novel samples is dynamic and differs from traditional out-of-distribution
(OOD) detection in that the set of in-distribution (ID) classes expands as new
classes are learned during application, whereas ID classes is fixed in
traditional OOD detection. Learning is also different from classic supervised
learning because in ALMD, we learn the encountered new classes immediately and
incrementally. It is difficult to retrain the model from scratch using all the
past data from the ID classes and the novel samples from newly discovered
classes, as this would be resource- and time-consuming. Apart from these two
challenges, ALMD faces the data scarcity issue because instances of new classes
often appear sporadically in real-life applications. To address these issues,
we propose a novel method, PLDA, which performs dynamic OOD detection and
incremental learning of new classes on the fly. Empirical evaluations will
demonstrate the effectiveness of PLDA.

TL;DR: ALPINE是一个轻量级自适应框架，让终端设备能够实时调整差分隐私级别，在动态边缘环境中平衡隐私保护、数据效用和能耗成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 移动边缘群智感知系统在动态资源受限环境中持续生成和传输用户数据，面临严重隐私威胁。静态差分隐私机制无法适应不断变化的风险，导致要么噪声过多要么保护不足。

Method: ALPINE作为闭环控制系统，包含四个模块：动态风险感知、基于TD3算法的隐私决策、本地隐私执行和边缘节点性能验证。设计了平衡隐私增益、数据效用和能耗成本的奖励函数。

Result: 理论分析和实际仿真表明，ALPINE能有效抵御推理攻击，同时保持数据效用和控制成本，适用于大规模边缘应用。

Conclusion: ALPINE框架通过自适应调整差分隐私级别，在动态边缘环境中实现了隐私保护、数据效用和能耗成本之间的动态平衡，具有实用价值。

Abstract: Mobile edge crowdsensing (MECS) systems continuously generate and transmit
user data in dynamic, resource-constrained environments, exposing users to
significant privacy threats. In practice, many privacy-preserving mechanisms
build on differential privacy (DP). However, static DP mechanisms often fail to
adapt to evolving risks, for example, shifts in adversarial capabilities,
resource constraints and task requirements, resulting in either excessive noise
or inadequate protection. To address this challenge, we propose ALPINE, a
lightweight, adaptive framework that empowers terminal devices to autonomously
adjust differential privacy levels in real time. ALPINE operates as a
closed-loop control system consisting of four modules: dynamic risk perception,
privacy decision via twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (TD3),
local privacy execution and performance verification from edge nodes. Based on
environmental risk assessments, we design a reward function that balances
privacy gains, data utility and energy cost, guiding the TD3 agent to
adaptively tune noise magnitude across diverse risk scenarios and achieve a
dynamic equilibrium among privacy, utility and cost. Both the collaborative
risk model and pretrained TD3-based agent are designed for low-overhead
deployment. Extensive theoretical analysis and real-world simulations
demonstrate that ALPINE effectively mitigates inference attacks while
preserving utility and cost, making it practical for large-scale edge
applications.

TL;DR: 提出了一个统一框架评估文本属性图(TAG)学习中GNN、RGNN和GraphLLM的鲁棒性，发现模型在文本和结构扰动间存在固有权衡，并提出了SFT-auto框架来提升平衡鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前对图神经网络(GNN)和大语言模型(LLM)在文本属性图(TAG)学习中的鲁棒性评估是碎片化的，缺乏对文本和结构扰动的系统性研究。

Method: 引入统一框架评估经典GNN、鲁棒GNN和GraphLLM在10个数据集上的表现，涵盖文本、结构和混合扰动，包括投毒和规避攻击场景。

Result: 发现模型在文本和结构鲁棒性间存在固有权衡；GNN和RGNN性能严重依赖文本编码器和攻击类型；GraphLLM对训练数据污染特别脆弱。

Conclusion: 提出了SFT-auto框架，能在单一模型中实现对文本和结构攻击的平衡鲁棒性，为TAG安全研究奠定基础并提供实用解决方案。

Abstract: While Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Large Language Models (LLMs) are
powerful approaches for learning on Text-Attributed Graphs (TAGs), a
comprehensive understanding of their robustness remains elusive. Current
evaluations are fragmented, failing to systematically investigate the distinct
effects of textual and structural perturbations across diverse models and
attack scenarios. To address these limitations, we introduce a unified and
comprehensive framework to evaluate robustness in TAG learning. Our framework
evaluates classical GNNs, robust GNNs (RGNNs), and GraphLLMs across ten
datasets from four domains, under diverse text-based, structure-based, and
hybrid perturbations in both poisoning and evasion scenarios. Our extensive
analysis reveals multiple findings, among which three are particularly
noteworthy: 1) models have inherent robustness trade-offs between text and
structure, 2) the performance of GNNs and RGNNs depends heavily on the text
encoder and attack type, and 3) GraphLLMs are particularly vulnerable to
training data corruption. To overcome the identified trade-offs, we introduce
SFT-auto, a novel framework that delivers superior and balanced robustness
against both textual and structural attacks within a single model. Our work
establishes a foundation for future research on TAG security and offers
practical solutions for robust TAG learning in adversarial environments. Our
code is available at: https://github.com/Leirunlin/TGRB.

Motivation: 分子动力学方法的快速发展超过了标准化验证工具的开发，不同模拟方法之间的客观比较受到评估指标不一致、稀有构象状态采样不足以及缺乏可重复基准测试的阻碍。

Result: 开发了包含9种不同蛋白质的数据集（10-224个残基），每个蛋白质在300K下进行了100万MD步骤（4纳秒）的广泛模拟。验证测试展示了框架在经典MD模拟和机器学习模型比较中的实用性。

Conclusion: 通过标准化评估协议和实现直接、可重复的MD方法比较，这个开源平台为分子模拟社区建立了一致、严谨的基准测试基础。

Abstract: The rapid evolution of molecular dynamics (MD) methods, including
machine-learned dynamics, has outpaced the development of standardized tools
for method validation. Objective comparison between simulation approaches is
often hindered by inconsistent evaluation metrics, insufficient sampling of
rare conformational states, and the absence of reproducible benchmarks. To
address these challenges, we introduce a modular benchmarking framework that
systematically evaluates protein MD methods using enhanced sampling analysis.
Our approach uses weighted ensemble (WE) sampling via The Weighted Ensemble
Simulation Toolkit with Parallelization and Analysis (WESTPA), based on
progress coordinates derived from Time-lagged Independent Component Analysis
(TICA), enabling fast and efficient exploration of protein conformational
space. The framework includes a flexible, lightweight propagator interface that
supports arbitrary simulation engines, allowing both classical force fields and
machine learning-based models. Additionally, the framework offers a
comprehensive evaluation suite capable of computing more than 19 different
metrics and visualizations across a variety of domains. We further contribute a
dataset of nine diverse proteins, ranging from 10 to 224 residues, that span a
variety of folding complexities and topologies. Each protein has been
extensively simulated at 300K for one million MD steps per starting point (4
ns). To demonstrate the utility of our framework, we perform validation tests
using classic MD simulations with implicit solvent and compare protein
conformational sampling using a fully trained versus under-trained CGSchNet
model. By standardizing evaluation protocols and enabling direct, reproducible
comparisons across MD approaches, our open-source platform lays the groundwork
for consistent, rigorous benchmarking across the molecular simulation
community.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: SOLE是一个软硬件协同设计，通过E2Softmax和AILayerNorm分别优化Transformer中的Softmax和LayerNorm操作，实现了无需重新训练的高效推理，在保持精度的同时显著提升速度和能效。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Transformer在NLP和CV任务中表现出色，但其实时推理速度和效率受到Softmax和LayerNorm操作效率低下的限制。现有基于函数近似的方法实现效率低，且需要重新训练来补偿近似误差，成本高昂且不便。

Method: SOLE采用软硬件协同设计：E2Softmax使用指数函数的log2量化和基于对数的除法来近似Softmax；AILayerNorm采用低精度统计计算。两者都实现了低精度计算和低比特位宽存储。

Result: 实验表明SOLE在无需重新训练的情况下保持推理精度，相比GPU实现了数量级的速度提升和能耗节省。与现有最优定制硬件相比，Softmax和LayerNorm分别实现了3.04倍、3.86倍的能效提升和2.82倍、3.32倍的面积效率提升。

Conclusion: SOLE通过软硬件协同设计有效解决了Transformer中Softmax和LayerNorm的效率瓶颈，在保持精度的同时显著提升了推理速度和能效，为Transformer的高效部署提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Transformers have shown remarkable performance in both natural language
processing (NLP) and computer vision (CV) tasks. However, their real-time
inference speed and efficiency are limited due to the inefficiency in Softmax
and Layer Normalization (LayerNorm). Previous works based on function
approximation suffer from inefficient implementation as they place emphasis on
computation while disregarding memory overhead concerns. Moreover, such methods
rely on retraining to compensate for approximation error which can be costly
and inconvenient.
  In this paper, we present SOLE, a hardware-software co-design for Softmax and
LayerNorm which is composed of E2Softmax and AILayerNorm. E2Softmax utilizes
log2 quantization of exponent function and log-based division to approximate
Softmax while AILayerNorm adopts low-precision statistic calculation. Compared
with state-of-the-art designs, we achieve both low-precision calculation and
low bit-width storage on Softmax and LayerNorm. Experiments show that SOLE
maintains inference accuracy without retraining while offering orders of
magnitude speedup and energy savings over GPU, achieving 3.04x, 3.86x
energy-efficiency improvements and 2.82x, 3.32x area-efficiency improvements
over prior state-of-the-art custom hardware for Softmax and LayerNorm,
respectively.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统掩码扩散在解码时采用二元决策（保留掩码或替换为预测标记），当保留掩码时会丢弃有价值的预测信息，限制了模型的性能。

Conclusion: 软掩码方法有效解决了掩码扩散中的信息丢失问题，通过保留部分预测信息提升了扩散语言模型的性能。

Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated strong potential in language modeling,
offering various advantages over traditional autoregressive approaches. Their
ability to generate and revise entire responses in parallel enables faster
generation and built-in self-correction mechanisms. Most modern diffusion-based
language models employ masked diffusion, where decoding involves iteratively
processing masked tokens based on a binary decision: either retaining the mask
or replacing it with the predicted token. However, this binary choice discards
valuable predictive information when the mask is retained. To address this
limitation, we introduce soft-masking (SM), a novel method that dynamically
blends the embedding of the mask token with the embeddings of the top-$k$
predicted tokens from the previous decoding step, for each retained mask. This
provides the model with a more informative prior, preserving context from
earlier computations and allowing partial information about masked tokens to
propagate beyond a single step. We propose a training methodology that adapts a
pretrained masked diffusion language model to incorporate SM. We demonstrate
that continuing pretraining a 169M parameter model with SM leads to improved
perplexity and MAUVE scores. Furthermore, we finetune two state-of-the-art
diffusion models, Dream-7B and Dream-Coder-7B, with SM. SM consistently
improves performance across multiple coding benchmarks, particularly in
high-throughput settings.

Motivation: 传统强化学习方法假设单峰高斯策略和标量评论家，无法有效处理高风险高回报任务中的多模态动作分布和随机回报问题。

Method: 将连续动作空间离散化以近似多模态分布，使用熵正则化探索提高风险但高回报动作的覆盖度，引入双评论家架构进行更准确的离散价值分布估计。

Result: 在具有高失败风险的移动和操作基准测试中，该方法优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 在强化学习中明确建模多模态性和风险对于处理高风险高回报任务至关重要。

Abstract: Tasks involving high-risk-high-return (HRHR) actions, such as obstacle
crossing, often exhibit multimodal action distributions and stochastic returns.
Most reinforcement learning (RL) methods assume unimodal Gaussian policies and
rely on scalar-valued critics, which limits their effectiveness in HRHR
settings. We formally define HRHR tasks and theoretically show that Gaussian
policies cannot guarantee convergence to the optimal solution. To address this,
we propose a reinforcement learning framework that (i) discretizes continuous
action spaces to approximate multimodal distributions, (ii) employs
entropy-regularized exploration to improve coverage of risky but rewarding
actions, and (iii) introduces a dual-critic architecture for more accurate
discrete value distribution estimation. The framework scales to
high-dimensional action spaces, supporting complex control domains. Experiments
on locomotion and manipulation benchmarks with high risks of failure
demonstrate that our method outperforms baselines, underscoring the importance
of explicitly modeling multimodality and risk in RL.

Abstract: Driver identification has become an area of increasing interest in recent
years, especially for data- driven applications, because biometric-based
technologies may incur privacy issues. This study proposes a deep learning
neural network architecture, an attention-based encoder (AttEnc), which uses an
attention mechanism for driver identification and uses fewer model parameters
than current methods. Most studies do not address the issue of data shortages
for driver identification, and most of them are inflexible when encountering
unknown drivers. In this study, an architecture that combines a prototypical
network and an attention-based encoder (P-AttEnc) is proposed. It applies
few-shot learning to overcome the data shortage issues and to enhance model
generalizations. The experiments showed that the attention-based encoder can
identify drivers with accuracies of 99.3%, 99.0% and 99.9% in three different
datasets and has a prediction time that is 44% to 79% faster because it
significantly reduces, on average, 87.6% of the model parameters. P-AttEnc
identifies drivers based on few shot data, extracts driver fingerprints to
address the issue of data shortages, and is able to classify unknown drivers.
The first experiment showed that P-AttEnc can identify drivers with an accuracy
of 69.8% in the one-shot scenario. The second experiment showed that P-AttEnc,
in the 1-shot scenario, can classify unknown drivers with an average accuracy
of 65.7%.

Conclusion: ADCMs框架有效解决了手动离散化方案的局限性，为一致性模型提供了自动、自适应的离散化方法，显著提升了训练效率和生成质量

Abstract: Consistency Models (CMs) have shown promise for efficient one-step
generation. However, most existing CMs rely on manually designed discretization
schemes, which can cause repeated adjustments for different noise schedules and
datasets. To address this, we propose a unified framework for the automatic and
adaptive discretization of CMs, formulating it as an optimization problem with
respect to the discretization step. Concretely, during the consistency training
process, we propose using local consistency as the optimization objective to
ensure trainability by avoiding excessive discretization, and taking global
consistency as a constraint to ensure stability by controlling the denoising
error in the training target. We establish the trade-off between local and
global consistency with a Lagrange multiplier. Building on this framework, we
achieve adaptive discretization for CMs using the Gauss-Newton method. We refer
to our approach as ADCMs. Experiments demonstrate that ADCMs significantly
improve the training efficiency of CMs, achieving superior generative
performance with minimal training overhead on both CIFAR-10 and ImageNet.
Moreover, ADCMs exhibit strong adaptability to more advanced DM variants. Code

Conclusion: ControlValve提供了一种更可靠的多智能体系统防御机制，通过控制流完整性强制执行来解决安全性与功能性的根本冲突问题。

Abstract: Control-flow hijacking attacks manipulate orchestration mechanisms in
multi-agent systems into performing unsafe actions that compromise the system
and exfiltrate sensitive information. Recently proposed defenses, such as
LlamaFirewall, rely on alignment checks of inter-agent communications to ensure
that all agent invocations are "related to" and "likely to further" the
original objective.
  We start by demonstrating control-flow hijacking attacks that evade these
defenses even if alignment checks are performed by advanced LLMs. We argue that
the safety and functionality objectives of multi-agent systems fundamentally
conflict with each other. This conflict is exacerbated by the brittle
definitions of "alignment" and the checkers' incomplete visibility into the
execution context.
  We then propose, implement, and evaluate ControlValve, a new defense inspired
by the principles of control-flow integrity and least privilege. ControlValve
(1) generates permitted control-flow graphs for multi-agent systems, and (2)
enforces that all executions comply with these graphs, along with contextual
rules (generated in a zero-shot manner) for each agent invocation.

### [394] [Symmetries in PAC-Bayesian Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17303)
*Armin Beck,Peter Ochs*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文扩展了机器学习中对称性的泛化保证，从紧致群对称性扩展到非紧致对称性（如平移），并放宽了数据分布不变性的假设。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有理论主要关注紧致群对称性且假设数据分布不变，这在现实应用中很少满足。需要将泛化保证扩展到更一般的非紧致对称性和非不变数据分布。

Method: 基于PAC-Bayes框架，改进并收紧现有边界，在McAllester的PAC-Bayes边界上验证方法，并证明其适用于广泛的PAC-Bayes边界。

Result: 在非均匀旋转群上的旋转MNIST数据集实验中，推导的保证不仅成立，而且优于先前结果。

Conclusion: 对于对称数据，对称模型在超越紧致群和不变分布限制的更广泛设置中具有优势，为理解机器学习中的对称性提供了更一般的理论基础。

Abstract: Symmetries are known to improve the empirical performance of machine learning
models, yet theoretical guarantees explaining these gains remain limited. Prior
work has focused mainly on compact group symmetries and often assumes that the
data distribution itself is invariant, an assumption rarely satisfied in
real-world applications. In this work, we extend generalization guarantees to
the broader setting of non-compact symmetries, such as translations and to
non-invariant data distributions. Building on the PAC-Bayes framework, we adapt
and tighten existing bounds, demonstrating the approach on McAllester's
PAC-Bayes bound while showing that it applies to a wide range of PAC-Bayes
bounds. We validate our theory with experiments on a rotated MNIST dataset with
a non-uniform rotation group, where the derived guarantees not only hold but
also improve upon prior results. These findings provide theoretical evidence
that, for symmetric data, symmetric models are preferable beyond the narrow
setting of compact groups and invariant distributions, opening the way to a
more general understanding of symmetries in machine learning.

Motivation: 现实世界数据包含多个交互的语义因子，但现有研究主要关注简单的双因子静态和动态设置，忽略了数据的多因子本质。

Method: 引入标准化基准，包括数据集集成工具、模型开发框架和评估指标；提出后验潜在探索阶段自动对齐潜在维度与语义因子；开发Koopman启发模型；利用视觉语言模型进行自动标注和零样本评估。

Conclusion: 这些贡献为推进多因子时序解缠结研究提供了稳健且可扩展的基础。

Abstract: Learning disentangled representations in sequential data is a key goal in
deep learning, with broad applications in vision, audio, and time series. While
real-world data involves multiple interacting semantic factors over time, prior
work has mostly focused on simpler two-factor static and dynamic settings,
primarily because such settings make data collection easier, thereby
overlooking the inherently multi-factor nature of real-world data. We introduce
the first standardized benchmark for evaluating multi-factor sequential
disentanglement across six diverse datasets spanning video, audio, and time
series. Our benchmark includes modular tools for dataset integration, model
development, and evaluation metrics tailored to multi-factor analysis. We
additionally propose a post-hoc Latent Exploration Stage to automatically align
latent dimensions with semantic factors, and introduce a Koopman-inspired model
that achieves state-of-the-art results. Moreover, we show that Vision-Language
Models can automate dataset annotation and serve as zero-shot disentanglement
evaluators, removing the need for manual labels and human intervention.
Together, these contributions provide a robust and scalable foundation for
advancing multi-factor sequential disentanglement.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有奖励模型开发成本高、可解释性差，基于准则的方法在可扩展性和可靠性之间存在权衡，需要解决这些限制。

Method: 两阶段方法：1) 使用验证引导的Propose-Evaluate-Revise管道推断高质量查询特定准则；2) 通过最大化信息论编码率将细粒度准则泛化为紧凑核心集，形成层次化的"主题-提示"准则集。

Result: 仅使用70个偏好对（源数据的1.5%），该方法使Qwen3-8B等小模型也能超越专门训练的对等模型，展示了卓越的数据效率和性能。

Conclusion: 这项工作开创了可扩展、可解释且数据高效的奖励建模路径。

Abstract: Reward models are essential for aligning Large Language Models (LLMs) with
human values, yet their development is hampered by costly preference datasets
and poor interpretability. While recent rubric-based approaches offer
transparency, they often lack systematic quality control and optimization,
creating a trade-off between scalability and reliability. We address these
limitations with a novel, training-free framework built on a key assumption:
\textit{evaluation rubrics underlying human preferences exhibit significant
generalization ability across diverse queries}, a property that enables
remarkable data efficiency. Our two-stage approach first infers high-quality,
query-specific rubrics using a validation-guided
\textbf{Propose-Evaluate-Revise} pipeline. Second, it generalizes these
granular rubrics into a compact, non-redundant core set by maximizing an
\textbf{information-theoretic coding rate}. The final output is an
interpretable, hierarchical "Theme-Tips" rubric set. Extensive experiments
demonstrate the framework's exceptional data efficiency and performance.
Critically, using just 70 preference pairs (1.5\% of the source data), our
method also empowers smaller models like Qwen3-8B to outperform specialized,
fully-trained counterparts. This work pioneers a scalable, interpretable, and
data-efficient path for reward modeling.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统语言模型在可解释性和性能之间的权衡问题，为需要透明性和能力的受监管领域提供支持。

Method: 使用位置性调节参数、信息论招募机制和层次化招募框架，通过注意力机制上的组稀疏惩罚、信息论锚点设计、动态规则注入和基于惩罚似然的招募标准实现。

Conclusion: 该框架使从业者能够在可解释模式和高性能模式之间连续插值，同时在多个粒度上适应架构容量，支持需要透明性和能力的应用场景。

Abstract: We present a novel framework for training large language models with
continuously adjustable internal representations that span the full spectrum
from localist (interpretable, rule-based) to distributed (generalizable,
efficient) encodings. The key innovations are (1) a locality dial, a tunable
parameter that dynamically controls the degree of localization during both
training and inference without requiring model retraining, (2) an
information-theoretic recruitment mechanism that adaptively allocates semantic
blocks as needed, eliminating the requirement for complete domain knowledge at
initialization, and (3) a hierarchical recruitment framework that extends
capacity allocation to entire specialized LLMs, enabling multi-granularity
architectural adaptation. This is achieved through group sparsity penalties on
attention mechanisms, information-theoretic anchor design, dynamic rule
injection, and principled recruitment criteria based on penalized likelihood
with explicit units. We provide rigorous mathematical results establishing
explicit threshold conditions under which attention provably concentrates on
semantically relevant blocks at stationary points, with exact bounds on
attention entropy and pointer fidelity. The hierarchical recruitment mechanism
provides convergence guarantees at both the block level (fine-grained,
within-LLM) and the LLM level (coarse-grained, cross-domain), ensuring the
system discovers semantic partitions that balance model complexity against data
encoding efficiency. This framework enables practitioners to continuously
interpolate between interpretable and high-performance modes while adapting
architectural capacity at multiple granularities, supporting applications in
regulated domains requiring both transparency and capability.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种生成图神经网络(GNN)模型"metamers"的技术，通过优化输入图使其内部节点激活与参考图匹配，揭示了GNNs中存在的极端表示不变性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究图神经网络中的不变性行为，探索人工神经网络与人类大脑在不变性机制上的差距。

Method: 引入模型metamers生成技术，通过优化输入图使其内部节点激活与参考图匹配，获得在模型表示空间中等价但在结构和节点特征上显著不同的图。

Result: 发现多个经典GNN架构存在极端水平的表示不变性，模型架构和训练策略的针对性修改只能部分缓解这种过度不变性。

Conclusion: 当前GNNs与人类类似不变性存在根本性差距，metamer图与原始图的偏差量化揭示了GNNs的独特失败模式，为模型评估提供了补充基准。

Abstract: In recent years, deep neural networks have been extensively employed in
perceptual systems to learn representations endowed with invariances, aiming to
emulate the invariance mechanisms observed in the human brain. However, studies
in the visual and auditory domains have confirmed that significant gaps remain
between the invariance properties of artificial neural networks and those of
humans. To investigate the invariance behavior within graph neural networks
(GNNs), we introduce a model ``metamers'' generation technique. By optimizing
input graphs such that their internal node activations match those of a
reference graph, we obtain graphs that are equivalent in the model's
representation space, yet differ significantly in both structure and node
features. Our theoretical analysis focuses on two aspects: the local metamer
dimension for a single node and the activation-induced volume change of the
metamer manifold. Utilizing this approach, we uncover extreme levels of
representational invariance across several classic GNN architectures. Although
targeted modifications to model architecture and training strategies can
partially mitigate this excessive invariance, they fail to fundamentally bridge
the gap to human-like invariance. Finally, we quantify the deviation between
metamer graphs and their original counterparts, revealing unique failure modes
of current GNNs and providing a complementary benchmark for model evaluation.

Result: 在原始环境所用时间的一小部分内达到收敛结果，显著提高了训练效率。

Conclusion: PINNs替代模型能有效解决强化学习在智能电网优化中的样本效率问题，大幅减少训练时间。

Abstract: Optimizing the energy management within a smart grids scenario presents
significant challenges, primarily due to the complexity of real-world systems
and the intricate interactions among various components. Reinforcement Learning
(RL) is gaining prominence as a solution for addressing the challenges of
Optimal Power Flow in smart grids. However, RL needs to iterate compulsively
throughout a given environment to obtain the optimal policy. This means
obtaining samples from a, most likely, costly simulator, which can lead to a
sample efficiency problem. In this work, we address this problem by
substituting costly smart grid simulators with surrogate models built using
Phisics-informed Neural Networks (PINNs), optimizing the RL policy training
process by arriving to convergent results in a fraction of the time employed by
the original environment.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前OOD检测方法将分布偏移压缩为单一标量异常分数，无法区分不同类型的OOD数据，限制了OOD数据的上下文理解和潜在利用。

Method: DISC利用扩散模型的迭代去噪过程，在多个噪声水平上提取丰富的多维特征向量来捕捉统计差异。

Result: 在图像和表格基准测试中，DISC在OOD检测方面达到或超越最先进方法，并首次实现了OOD类型的分类能力。

Conclusion: DISC实现了从简单二元OOD检测到更细粒度检测的转变，为OOD数据的上下文理解和利用提供了新途径。

Abstract: Detecting out-of-distribution (OOD) data is critical for machine learning, be
it for safety reasons or to enable open-ended learning. However, beyond mere
detection, choosing an appropriate course of action typically hinges on the
type of OOD data encountered. Unfortunately, the latter is generally not
distinguished in practice, as modern OOD detection methods collapse
distributional shifts into single scalar outlier scores. This work argues that
scalar-based methods are thus insufficient for OOD data to be properly
contextualized and prospectively exploited, a limitation we overcome with the
introduction of DISC: Diffusion-based Statistical Characterization. DISC
leverages the iterative denoising process of diffusion models to extract a
rich, multi-dimensional feature vector that captures statistical discrepancies
across multiple noise levels. Extensive experiments on image and tabular
benchmarks show that DISC matches or surpasses state-of-the-art detectors for
OOD detection and, crucially, also classifies OOD type, a capability largely
absent from prior work. As such, our work enables a shift from simple binary
OOD detection to a more granular detection.

TL;DR: TabR1是首个用于表格预测的推理大语言模型，通过多步推理和创新的PRPO强化学习方法，在有限监督下激活LLMs的推理能力，在少样本和零样本场景下实现优异性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统表格预测方法（如梯度提升树和专用深度学习模型）在任务内表现优秀但可解释性有限、跨表迁移能力弱。推理LLMs具有跨任务适应性和透明推理轨迹的潜力，但尚未在表格数据中充分发挥。

Method: 提出TabR1模型，核心是Permutation Relative Policy Optimization (PRPO)方法，通过构建多个标签保持的列排列样本，在排列内和跨排列估计优势值，将稀疏奖励转化为密集学习信号，编码列排列不变性作为结构先验。

Result: TabR1在全监督微调下达到与强基线相当的性能。在零样本设置下，TabR1接近强基线在32样本设置下的性能。TabR1(8B)在各种任务中显著优于更大的LLMs，相比DeepSeek-R1(685B)提升高达53.17%。

Conclusion: PRPO方法有效激活了LLMs在表格预测中的推理能力，提升了少样本、零样本性能和可解释性，证明了推理LLMs在表格数据中的巨大潜力。

Abstract: Tabular prediction has traditionally relied on gradient-boosted decision
trees and specialized deep learning models, which excel within tasks but
provide limited interpretability and weak transfer across tables. Reasoning
large language models (LLMs) promise cross-task adaptability with trans- parent
reasoning traces, yet their potential has not been fully realized for tabular
data. This paper presents TabR1, the first reasoning LLM for tabular prediction
with multi-step reasoning. At its core is Permutation Relative Policy
Optimization (PRPO), a simple yet efficient reinforcement learning method that
encodes column-permutation invariance as a structural prior. By construct- ing
multiple label-preserving permutations per sample and estimating advantages
both within and across permutations, PRPO transforms sparse rewards into dense
learning signals and improves generalization. With limited supervision, PRPO
activates the reasoning ability of LLMs for tabular prediction, enhancing
few-shot and zero-shot performance as well as interpretability. Comprehensive
experiments demonstrate that TabR1 achieves performance comparable to strong
baselines under full-supervision fine-tuning. In the zero-shot setting, TabR1
approaches the performance of strong baselines under the 32-shot setting.
Moreover, TabR1 (8B) substantially outperforms much larger LLMs across various
tasks, achieving up to 53.17% improvement over DeepSeek-R1 (685B).

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有随机化赌博机算法通常存在计算复杂度高（O(d^{3/2}√T)遗憾）的问题，且难以扩展到非参数或神经网络模型。

Method: 特征扰动技术：直接在特征输入中注入随机性，而不是随机化未知参数或向奖励添加噪声。

Result: 实现了O(d√T)的最坏情况遗憾界限，优于现有随机化算法的O(d^{3/2}√T)遗憾，且计算效率高，能自然扩展到非参数模型。

Conclusion: 特征扰动技术统一了强大实际性能与最优理论保证，超越了现有方法，具有计算效率和模型扩展性的双重优势。

Abstract: We propose feature perturbation, a simple yet powerful technique that injects
randomness directly into feature inputs, instead of randomizing unknown
parameters or adding noise to rewards. Remarkably, this algorithm achieves
$\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(d\sqrt{T})$ worst-case regret bound for generalized linear
bandits, while avoiding the $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(d^{3/2}\sqrt{T})$ regret
typical of existing randomized bandit algorithms. Because our algorithm eschews
parameter sampling, it is both computationally efficient and naturally extends
to non-parametric or neural network models. We verify these advantages through
empirical evaluations, demonstrating that feature perturbation not only
surpasses existing methods but also unifies strong practical performance with
best-known theoretical guarantees.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有平均奖励离线强化学习方法依赖严格假设（如遍历性或线性MDP），而弱通信MDP假设更为温和，需要开发新的分析方法。

Method: 提出锚定拟合Q迭代方法，将标准拟合Q迭代与锚定机制结合，锚定机制可解释为一种权重衰减形式。

Result: 建立了弱通信MDP下平均奖励离线强化学习的首个样本复杂度结果，并将分析扩展到单轨迹生成数据集的情况。

Conclusion: 锚定机制对于在平均奖励设置中实现有限时间分析至关重要，为更广泛类别的MDP提供了理论保证。

Abstract: Although there is an extensive body of work characterizing the sample
complexity of discounted-return offline RL with function approximations, prior
work on the average-reward setting has received significantly less attention,
and existing approaches rely on restrictive assumptions, such as ergodicity or
linearity of the MDP. In this work, we establish the first sample complexity
results for average-reward offline RL with function approximation for weakly
communicating MDPs, a much milder assumption. To this end, we introduce
Anchored Fitted Q-Iteration, which combines the standard Fitted Q-Iteration
with an anchor mechanism. We show that the anchor, which can be interpreted as
a form of weight decay, is crucial for enabling finite-time analysis in the
average-reward setting. We also extend our finite-time analysis to the setup
where the dataset is generated from a single-trajectory rather than IID
transitions, again leveraging the anchor mechanism.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态神经网络训练常受模态过拟合困扰，网络过度依赖某一模态导致性能不佳，限制了多模态学习的潜力

Method: MILES利用训练过程中模态条件利用率差异动态调整学习率，平衡多模态学习速度

Result: 在四个多模态联合融合任务中，MILES优于7个最先进基线方法，在所有任务和融合方法中表现最佳

Conclusion: 平衡多模态学习能显著提升模型性能，MILES能有效平衡模态使用，提高多模态性能并增强模态编码器

Abstract: The aim of multimodal neural networks is to combine diverse data sources,
referred to as modalities, to achieve enhanced performance compared to relying
on a single modality. However, training of multimodal networks is typically
hindered by modality overfitting, where the network relies excessively on one
of the available modalities. This often yields sub-optimal performance,
hindering the potential of multimodal learning and resulting in marginal
improvements relative to unimodal models. In this work, we present the
Modality-Informed Learning ratE Scheduler (MILES) for training multimodal joint
fusion models in a balanced manner. MILES leverages the differences in
modality-wise conditional utilization rates during training to effectively
balance multimodal learning. The learning rate is dynamically adjusted during
training to balance the speed of learning from each modality by the multimodal
model, aiming for enhanced performance in both multimodal and unimodal
predictions. We extensively evaluate MILES on four multimodal joint fusion
tasks and compare its performance to seven state-of-the-art baselines. Our
results show that MILES outperforms all baselines across all tasks and fusion
methods considered in our study, effectively balancing modality usage during
training. This results in improved multimodal performance and stronger modality
encoders, which can be leveraged when dealing with unimodal samples or absent
modalities. Overall, our work highlights the impact of balancing multimodal
learning on improving model performance.

Motivation: 时间序列数据常受缺失值、噪声和异常值等污染，传统深度学习方法需要大量预训练且难以应对分布偏移。

Result: 实现了高恢复性能，对异常值具有鲁棒性，且不依赖高斯噪声假设。

Conclusion: RINS-T为复杂现实世界时间序列问题提供了灵活有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Time series data are often affected by various forms of corruption, such as
missing values, noise, and outliers, which pose significant challenges for
tasks such as forecasting and anomaly detection. To address these issues,
inverse problems focus on reconstructing the original signal from corrupted
data by leveraging prior knowledge about its underlying structure. While deep
learning methods have demonstrated potential in this domain, they often require
extensive pretraining and struggle to generalize under distribution shifts. In
this work, we propose RINS-T (Robust Implicit Neural Solvers for Time Series
Linear Inverse Problems), a novel deep prior framework that achieves high
recovery performance without requiring pretraining data. RINS-T leverages
neural networks as implicit priors and integrates robust optimization
techniques, making it resilient to outliers while relaxing the reliance on
Gaussian noise assumptions. To further improve optimization stability and
robustness, we introduce three key innovations: guided input initialization,
input perturbation, and convex output combination techniques. Each of these
contributions strengthens the framework's optimization stability and
robustness. These advancements make RINS-T a flexible and effective solution
for addressing complex real-world time series challenges. Our code is available

Motivation: 传统ECG分析方法难以同时捕捉全局趋势和局部波形特征的高时间分辨率交互，需要一种能桥接全局和局部信号分析的方法。

Method: 引入S4ECG架构，利用结构化状态空间模型进行多时段心律失常分类，通过联合多时段预测来捕捉时间依赖性。

Result: 多时段方法比单时段方法在宏观AUROC上提升1.0-11.6%，心房颤动特异性从0.718-0.979提高到0.967-0.998，在分布内和分布外都表现出优越性能。

Conclusion: 这项工作推动了时间感知心律失常检测算法的范式转变，为ECG解释特别是复杂心律失常如心房颤动和心房扑动开辟了新可能性。

Abstract: The electrocardiogram (ECG) exemplifies biosignal-based time series with
continuous, temporally ordered structure reflecting cardiac physiological and
pathophysiological dynamics. Detailed analysis of these dynamics has proven
challenging, as conventional methods capture either global trends or local
waveform features but rarely their simultaneous interplay at high temporal
resolution. To bridge global and local signal analysis, we introduce S4ECG, a
novel deep learning architecture leveraging structured state space models for
multi-epoch arrhythmia classification. Our joint multi-epoch predictions
significantly outperform single-epoch approaches by 1.0-11.6% in macro-AUROC,
with atrial fibrillation specificity improving from 0.718-0.979 to 0.967-0.998,
demonstrating superior performance in-distribution and enhanced
out-of-distribution robustness. Systematic investigation reveals optimal
temporal dependency windows spanning 10-20 minutes for peak performance. This
work contributes to a paradigm shift toward temporally-aware arrhythmia
detection algorithms, opening new possibilities for ECG interpretation, in
particular for complex arrhythmias like atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of lithium-ion battery capacity and its associated
uncertainty is essential for reliable battery management but remains
challenging due to the stochastic nature of aging. This paper presents a novel
method, termed the Condition Diffusion U-Net with Attention (CDUA), which
integrates feature engineering and deep learning to address this challenge. The
proposed approach employs a diffusion-based generative model for time-series
forecasting and incorporates attention mechanisms to enhance predictive
performance. Battery capacity is first derived from real-world vehicle
operation data. The most relevant features are then identified using the
Pearson correlation coefficient and the XGBoost algorithm. These features are
used to train the CDUA model, which comprises two core components: (1) a
contextual U-Net with self-attention to capture complex temporal dependencies,
and (2) a denoising network to reconstruct accurate capacity values from noisy
observations. Experimental validation on the real-world vehicle data
demonstrates that the proposed CDUA model achieves a relative Mean Absolute
Error (MAE) of 0.94% and a relative Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 1.14%,
with a narrow 95% confidence interval of 3.74% in relative width. These results
confirm that CDUA provides both accurate capacity estimation and reliable
uncertainty quantification. Comparative experiments further verify its
robustness and superior performance over existing mainstream approaches.

Abstract: Dataset distillation aims to synthesize compact yet informative datasets from
large ones. A significant challenge in this field is achieving a trifecta of
diversity, generalization, and representativeness in a single distilled
dataset. Although recent generative dataset distillation methods adopt powerful
diffusion models as their foundation models, the inherent representativeness
prior in diffusion models is overlooked. Consequently, these approaches often
necessitate the integration of external constraints to enhance data quality. To
address this, we propose Diffusion As Priors (DAP), which formalizes
representativeness by quantifying the similarity between synthetic and real
data in feature space using a Mercer kernel. We then introduce this prior as
guidance to steer the reverse diffusion process, enhancing the
representativeness of distilled samples without any retraining. Extensive
experiments on large-scale datasets, such as ImageNet-1K and its subsets,
demonstrate that DAP outperforms state-of-the-art methods in generating
high-fidelity datasets while achieving superior cross-architecture
generalization. Our work not only establishes a theoretical connection between
diffusion priors and the objectives of dataset distillation but also provides a
practical, training-free framework for improving the quality of the distilled
dataset.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的全局方法在解决MPNNs的过度平滑和过度压缩问题时存在局限性，可能导致某些区域受益而其他区域受损，最终导致次优表达能力。

Method: 连接局部黎曼几何与MPNNs，建立非齐次边界条件，基于Robin条件设计具有局部瓶颈调整的GBN网络。

Result: 在亲同性和异同性图上的广泛实验显示GBN具有出色的表达能力，即使在网络深度超过256层时也不会出现性能下降。

Conclusion: 局部方法比全局方法更有效地解决图神经网络中的过度平滑和过度压缩问题，GBN网络在深层网络中保持稳定性能。

Abstract: Message Passing Neural Networks (MPNNs) is the building block of graph
foundation models, but fundamentally suffer from oversmoothing and
oversquashing. There has recently been a surge of interest in fixing both
issues. Existing efforts primarily adopt global approaches, which may be
beneficial in some regions but detrimental in others, ultimately leading to the
suboptimal expressiveness. In this paper, we begin by revisiting oversquashing
through a global measure -- spectral gap $\lambda$ -- and prove that the
increase of $\lambda$ leads to gradient vanishing with respect to the input
features, thereby undermining the effectiveness of message passing. Motivated
by such theoretical insights, we propose a \textbf{local} approach that
adaptively adjusts message passing based on local structures. To achieve this,
we connect local Riemannian geometry with MPNNs, and establish a novel
nonhomogeneous boundary condition to address both oversquashing and
oversmoothing. Building on the Robin condition, we design a GBN network with
local bottleneck adjustment, coupled with theoretical guarantees. Extensive
experiments on homophilic and heterophilic graphs show the expressiveness of
GBN. Furthermore, GBN does not exhibit performance degradation even when the
network depth exceeds $256$ layers.

TL;DR: 应用可解释AI技术（Grad-CAM和SHAP）解释PhaseNet地震检测模型，并通过SHAP门控推理方案提升模型性能，在9000个波形测试集上F1分数达到0.98，优于基准模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然PhaseNet等深度神经网络在微地震事件检测中表现出高精度，但其黑盒特性在关键应用中存在可靠性担忧，需要可解释方法来增强模型可信度。

Method: 使用Grad-CAM和SHAP解释PhaseNet模型决策，Grad-CAM可视化网络关注区域，SHAP量化特征贡献度，并基于此开发SHAP门控推理方案结合模型输出和解释指标。

Result: Grad-CAM显示网络关注区域与P波和S波到达时间一致；SHAP确认垂直分量振幅驱动P相拾取，水平分量主导S相拾取，符合地球物理原理。SHAP门控模型在测试集上F1分数0.98（精度0.99，召回率0.97），优于基准PhaseNet（F1分数0.97），且对噪声更具鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 可解释AI不仅能解释深度学习模型，还能直接提升其性能，为构建可信的自动化地震检测器提供了模板。

Abstract: Deep neural networks like PhaseNet show high accuracy in detecting
microseismic events, but their black-box nature is a concern in critical
applications. We apply explainable AI (XAI) techniques, such as
Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM) and Shapley Additive
Explanations (SHAP), to interpret the PhaseNet model's decisions and improve
its reliability. Grad-CAM highlights that the network's attention aligns with
P- and S-wave arrivals. SHAP values quantify feature contributions, confirming
that vertical-component amplitudes drive P-phase picks while horizontal
components dominate S-phase picks, consistent with geophysical principles.
Leveraging these insights, we introduce a SHAP-gated inference scheme that
combines the model's output with an explanation-based metric to reduce errors.
On a test set of 9,000 waveforms, the SHAP-gated model achieved an F1-score of
0.98 (precision 0.99, recall 0.97), outperforming the baseline PhaseNet
(F1-score 0.97) and demonstrating enhanced robustness to noise. These results
show that XAI can not only interpret deep learning models but also directly
enhance their performance, providing a template for building trust in automated
seismic detectors.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前ECG生物识别研究主要关注静息状态，而静息-运动场景下的性能下降问题尚未解决，需要开发能够应对不同生理状态的鲁棒认证模型。

Method: 结合多尺度深度卷积特征提取和注意力机制，构建跨状态ECG认证模型，确保在不同生理状态下都能实现强识别能力。

Result: 在运动-ECGID数据集上，Rest-to-Exercise场景准确率达92.50%，Exercise-to-Rest场景达94.72%，Rest-to-Rest场景达99.94%，Mixed-to-Mixed场景达97.85%。在ECG-ID和MIT-BIH数据集上进一步验证了泛化能力。

Conclusion: CrossStateECG在动态现实环境中具有作为运动后ECG认证实用解决方案的潜力，能够有效应对跨状态身份识别挑战。

Abstract: Current research in Electrocardiogram (ECG) biometrics mainly emphasizes
resting-state conditions, leaving the performance decline in rest-exercise
scenarios largely unresolved. This paper introduces CrossStateECG, a robust
ECG-based authentication model explicitly tailored for cross-state
(rest-exercise) conditions. The proposed model creatively combines multi-scale
deep convolutional feature extraction with attention mechanisms to ensure
strong identification across different physiological states. Experimental
results on the exercise-ECGID dataset validate the effectiveness of
CrossStateECG, achieving an identification accuracy of 92.50% in the
Rest-to-Exercise scenario (training on resting ECG and testing on post-exercise
ECG) and 94.72% in the Exercise-to-Rest scenario (training on post-exercise ECG
and testing on resting ECG). Furthermore, CrossStateECG demonstrates
exceptional performance across both state combinations, reaching an accuracy of
99.94% in Rest-to-Rest scenarios and 97.85% in Mixed-to-Mixed scenarios.
Additional validations on the ECG-ID and MIT-BIH datasets further confirmed the
generalization abilities of CrossStateECG, underscoring its potential as a
practical solution for post-exercise ECG-based authentication in dynamic

TL;DR: ZACH-ViT是一种轻量级视觉变换器，用于区分心源性肺水肿与非心源性肺水肿和正常肺组织，在肺超声视频分类中表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于非心源性炎症模式、间质性肺病和健康肺组织在肺超声中视觉变异性高，且存在重叠的B线和胸膜伪影，使得自动分类变得困难。

Method: 提出ZACH-ViT（零标记自适应紧凑分层视觉变换器），移除位置嵌入和[CLS]标记，使其完全排列不变；同时提出ShuffleStrides数据增强方法，在保持解剖有效性的前提下对探头视图序列和帧顺序进行排列。

Result: 在380个肺超声视频上评估，ZACH-ViT获得最高的验证和测试ROC-AUC（0.80和0.79），平衡灵敏度（0.60）和特异性（0.91），而所有竞争模型都崩溃为平凡分类。

Conclusion: 将架构设计与数据结构对齐可以在小数据医学成像中超越规模效应，支持实时临床部署。

Abstract: Differentiating cardiogenic pulmonary oedema (CPE) from non-cardiogenic and
structurally normal lungs in lung ultrasound (LUS) videos remains challenging
due to the high visual variability of non-cardiogenic inflammatory patterns
(NCIP/ARDS-like), interstitial lung disease, and healthy lungs. This
heterogeneity complicates automated classification as overlapping B-lines and
pleural artefacts are common. We introduce ZACH-ViT (Zero-token Adaptive
Compact Hierarchical Vision Transformer), a 0.25 M-parameter Vision Transformer
variant that removes both positional embeddings and the [CLS] token, making it
fully permutation-invariant and suitable for unordered medical image data. To
enhance generalization, we propose ShuffleStrides Data Augmentation (SSDA),
which permutes probe-view sequences and frame orders while preserving
anatomical validity. ZACH-ViT was evaluated on 380 LUS videos from 95
critically ill patients against nine state-of-the-art baselines. Despite the
heterogeneity of the non-cardiogenic group, ZACH-ViT achieved the highest
validation and test ROC-AUC (0.80 and 0.79) with balanced sensitivity (0.60)
and specificity (0.91), while all competing models collapsed to trivial
classification. It trains 1.35x faster than Minimal ViT (0.62M parameters) with
2.5x fewer parameters, supporting real-time clinical deployment. These results
show that aligning architectural design with data structure can outperform
scale in small-data medical imaging.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究Transformers在训练期间未观察到的序列上表现出的组合推理能力，探索其内部机制如何支持这种能力。

Method: 使用随机层次模型(RHM)作为概率上下文无关文法生成序列，在序列子集上训练模型，并在四种泛化条件下评估：记忆、分布内泛化、分布外泛化（相同规则）和跨层迁移。

Result: 性能随任务复杂性和上下文示例数量系统性提升，分布外任务需要比分布内场景更多的示例。训练过程中出现层级专业化，与泛化性能相关。PCA和注意力模式聚类显示Transformers在专门化层中发展出结构化、层次化组织的表示。

Conclusion: Transformers发展出模块化、可解释的机制来支持组合推理，将内部算法结构与观察到的行为能力联系起来。

Abstract: Transformers exhibit compositional reasoning on sequences not observed during
training, a capability often attributed to in-context learning (ICL) and skill
composition. We investigate this phenomenon using the Random Hierarchy Model
(RHM), a probabilistic context-free grammar that generates sequences through
recursive rule application. Models are trained on subsets of sequences and
evaluated across four generalization conditions: memorization, in-distribution
generalization, out-of-distribution generalization with the same rules, and
cross-layer transfer. Behaviorally, performance improves systematically with
task complexity and the number of in-context examples, with out-of-distribution
tasks requiring substantially more examples than in-distribution scenarios.
Mechanistically, we identify a progressive emergence of layer specialization
during training that correlates with generalization performance. Principal
component analysis and attention pattern clustering reveal that transformers
develop structured, hierarchically organized representations in specialized
layers. These results demonstrate that transformers develop modular,
interpretable mechanisms supporting compositional reasoning, linking internal
algorithmic structure to observed behavioral capabilities.

Motivation: 解决跨域EEG情感识别中个体间差异导致的泛化能力受限问题，特别是多源域适应中的负迁移和语义一致性挑战。

Method: 结合原型约束和对抗学习，使用基于MMD的域感知源加权策略动态估计域间偏移，并采用原型引导的条件对齐模块增强伪标签可靠性。

Result: 在SEED和SEED-IV数据集上分别达到94.86%和79.78%（跨被试）、95.12%和83.15%（跨会话）的平均准确率，在FACED数据集上达到82.88%（跨被试）。

Conclusion: DAMSDAN框架通过动态源加权和细粒度语义对齐，有效提升了跨域EEG情感识别的性能，消融实验和可解释性分析验证了其有效性。

Abstract: Significant inter-individual variability limits the generalization of
EEG-based emotion recognition under cross-domain settings. We address two core
challenges in multi-source adaptation: (1) dynamically modeling distributional
heterogeneity across sources and quantifying their relevance to a target to
reduce negative transfer; and (2) achieving fine-grained semantic consistency
to strengthen class discrimination. We propose a distribution-aware
multi-source domain adaptation network (DAMSDAN). DAMSDAN integrates
prototype-based constraints with adversarial learning to drive the encoder
toward discriminative, domain-invariant emotion representations. A domain-aware
source weighting strategy based on maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) dynamically
estimates inter-domain shifts and reweights source contributions. In addition,
a prototype-guided conditional alignment module with dual pseudo-label
interaction enhances pseudo-label reliability and enables category-level,
fine-grained alignment, mitigating noise propagation and semantic drift.
Experiments on SEED and SEED-IV show average accuracies of 94.86\% and 79.78\%
for cross-subject, and 95.12\% and 83.15\% for cross-session protocols. On the
large-scale FACED dataset, DAMSDAN achieves 82.88\% (cross-subject). Extensive
ablations and interpretability analyses corroborate the effectiveness of the
proposed framework for cross-domain EEG-based emotion recognition.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本研究探讨了生成对抗网络(GAN)在河流沉积物建模中的反演应用，发现GAN的潜在空间纠缠问题限制了其匹配井和地震数据的能力，提出了局部微调方法来改善匹配效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 地下决策成本高且不确定性大，获取新数据难以扩展。将地质知识直接嵌入预测模型提供了有价值的替代方案，过程模型可以帮助训练生成模型以提高预测效率。

Method: 使用生成对抗网络(GAN)训练河流沉积物生成模型，应用四种反演方法在包含4、8和20口井的三个测试样本上进行实验，并采用标签条件化、潜在空间过参数化和局部微调等技术。

Result: 反演方法在匹配井数据方面表现不佳，特别是当井数增加或测试样本与训练数据差异较大时。局部微调GAN可以显著减少不匹配，达到可接受水平，但依赖于初始部分成功的反演步骤。

Conclusion: GAN已能处理地质建模工作流中的任务，但仍需进一步评估其鲁棒性，以及如何最好地利用它们支持地质解释。

Abstract: High costs and uncertainties make subsurface decision-making challenging, as
acquiring new data is rarely scalable. Embedding geological knowledge directly
into predictive models offers a valuable alternative. A joint approach enables
just that: process-based models that mimic geological processes can help train
generative models that make predictions more efficiently. This study explores
whether a generative adversarial network (GAN) - a type of deep-learning
algorithm for generative modeling - trained to produce fluvial deposits can be
inverted to match well and seismic data. Four inversion approaches applied to
three test samples with 4, 8, and 20 wells struggled to match these well data,
especially as the well number increased or as the test sample diverged from the
training data. The key bottleneck lies in the GAN's latent representation: it
is entangled, so samples with similar sedimentological features are not
necessarily close in the latent space. Label conditioning or latent
overparameterization can partially disentangle the latent space during
training, although not yet sufficiently for a successful inversion. Fine-tuning
the GAN to restructure the latent space locally reduces mismatches to
acceptable levels for all test cases, with and without seismic data. But this
approach depends on an initial, partially successful inversion step, which
influences the quality and diversity of the final samples. Overall, GANs can
already handle the tasks required for their integration into geomodeling
workflows. We still need to further assess their robustness, and how to best
leverage them in support of geological interpretation.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前去中心化学习中的差分隐私方法在实践中观察到的隐私-效用权衡往往比集中式训练更差，这可能是由于现有DP会计方法的局限性。

Method: 通过推广现有的矩阵分解结果，将标准DL算法和常见信任模型统一到一个公式中，并开发了MAFALDA-SGD算法（一种基于gossip的DL算法，具有用户级相关噪声）。

Result: 该方法为现有DP-DL算法提供了更严格的隐私会计，并在合成和真实世界图上优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 基于矩阵分解的隐私会计方法可以改善去中心化学习中的隐私-效用权衡，为开发新的DP-DL算法提供了原则性方法。

Abstract: Decentralized Learning (DL) enables users to collaboratively train models
without sharing raw data by iteratively averaging local updates with neighbors
in a network graph. This setting is increasingly popular for its scalability
and its ability to keep data local under user control. Strong privacy
guarantees in DL are typically achieved through Differential Privacy (DP), with
results showing that DL can even amplify privacy by disseminating noise across
peer-to-peer communications. Yet in practice, the observed privacy-utility
trade-off often appears worse than in centralized training, which may be due to
limitations in current DP accounting methods for DL. In this paper, we show
that recent advances in centralized DP accounting based on Matrix Factorization
(MF) for analyzing temporal noise correlations can also be leveraged in DL. By
generalizing existing MF results, we show how to cast both standard DL
algorithms and common trust models into a unified formulation. This yields
tighter privacy accounting for existing DP-DL algorithms and provides a
principled way to develop new ones. To demonstrate the approach, we introduce
MAFALDA-SGD, a gossip-based DL algorithm with user-level correlated noise that
outperforms existing methods on synthetic and real-world graphs.

Conclusion: 局部几何分析框架为改进网络架构和训练稳定性提供了实用见解，可用于指导深度神经网络的设计和诊断。

Abstract: We introduce a methodology for analyzing neural networks through the lens of
layer-wise Hessian matrices. The local Hessian of each functional block (layer)
is defined as the matrix of second derivatives of a scalar function with
respect to the parameters of that layer. This concept provides a formal tool
for characterizing the local geometry of the parameter space. We show that the
spectral properties of local Hessians, such as the distribution of eigenvalues,
reveal quantitative patterns associated with overfitting,
underparameterization, and expressivity in neural network architectures. We
conduct an extensive empirical study involving 111 experiments across 37
datasets. The results demonstrate consistent structural regularities in the
evolution of local Hessians during training and highlight correlations between
their spectra and generalization performance. These findings establish a
foundation for using local geometric analysis to guide the diagnosis and design
of deep neural networks. The proposed framework connects optimization geometry
with functional behavior and offers practical insight for improving network
architectures and training stability.

Result: 与LLMs相比，LRMs在更长的推理关系和更广的属性范围上表现出更好的生产性和系统性。但LRMs在不确定性推理方面仍有显著挑战，无法有效探索多个概率结果。

Conclusion: LRMs在复杂推理任务上优于LLMs，但在处理不确定性和概率推理方面仍有待改进，需要开发更好的方法来处理不确定性推理。

Abstract: We introduce I-RAVEN-X, a symbolic benchmark designed to evaluate
generalization and robustness in analogical and mathematical reasoning for
Large Language Models (LLMs) and Large Reasoning Models (LRMs). I-RAVEN-X
extends I-RAVEN by increasing operand complexity, attribute range, and
introducing perceptual uncertainty. Compared to LLMs, empirical results show
that LRMs achieve improved productivity and systematicity on longer reasoning
relations and wider attribute ranges, respectively. However, LRMs are still
significantly challenged by reasoning under uncertainty and cannot effectively
explore multiple probabilistic outcomes.

Method: 提出基于动量的算法，在标准平滑性和有界方差假设下实现收敛

Result: 证明无动量时无论步长如何都可能不收敛，动量方法具有可证明的收敛性和强实证性能

Conclusion: 动量是实现随机DC优化小批量收敛的关键因素

Abstract: Stochastic difference-of-convex (DC) optimization is prevalent in numerous
machine learning applications, yet its convergence properties under small batch
sizes remain poorly understood. Existing methods typically require large
batches or strong noise assumptions, which limit their practical use. In this
work, we show that momentum enables convergence under standard smoothness and
bounded variance assumptions (of the concave part) for any batch size. We prove
that without momentum, convergence may fail regardless of stepsize,
highlighting its necessity. Our momentum-based algorithm achieves provable
convergence and demonstrates strong empirical performance.

Motivation: 传统优化理论只保证小步长梯度下降的单调目标下降，但神经网络训练常在大步长"稳定性边缘"进行，目标非单调下降且偏向平坦最小值。本文旨在量化这一现象。

Method: 利用过参数化使全局最小化器形成黎曼流形，将GD动态分解为平行和正交于流形的分量，分别对应黎曼梯度下降和目标锐度的分岔动力系统。

Result: 识别了三个学习率区间：(a)亚临界区：有限时间内克服瞬时不稳定性后线性收敛到次优平坦最小值；(b)临界区：不稳定性持续存在，以幂律收敛到最优平坦最小值；(c)超临界区：不稳定性持续存在，线性收敛到以最优平坦最小值为中心的周期2轨道。

Conclusion: 通过流形分解方法，首次在大学习率梯度下降中建立了收敛率理论，解释了稳定性边缘现象中非单调收敛和隐式偏置的机制。

Abstract: Classical optimisation theory guarantees monotonic objective decrease for
gradient descent (GD) when employed in a small step size, or ``stable", regime.
In contrast, gradient descent on neural networks is frequently performed in a
large step size regime called the ``edge of stability", in which the objective
decreases non-monotonically with an observed implicit bias towards flat minima.
In this paper, we take a step toward quantifying this phenomenon by providing
convergence rates for gradient descent with large learning rates in an
overparametrised least squares setting. The key insight behind our analysis is
that, as a consequence of overparametrisation, the set of global minimisers
forms a Riemannian manifold $M$, which enables the decomposition of the GD
dynamics into components parallel and orthogonal to $M$. The parallel component
corresponds to Riemannian gradient descent on the objective sharpness, while
the orthogonal component is a bifurcating dynamical system. This insight allows
us to derive convergence rates in three regimes characterised by the learning
rate size: (a) the subcritical regime, in which transient instability is
overcome in finite time before linear convergence to a suboptimally flat global
minimum; (b) the critical regime, in which instability persists for all time
with a power-law convergence toward the optimally flat global minimum; and (c)
the supercritical regime, in which instability persists for all time with
linear convergence to an orbit of period two centred on the optimally flat
global minimum.

remains a fundamental challenge. Despite advances in pruning methods that
create sparse architectures, understanding why some sparse structures are
better trainable than others with the same level of sparsity remains poorly
understood. Aiming to develop a systematic approach to this fundamental
problem, we propose a novel theoretical framework based on the theory of graph
limits, particularly graphons, that characterizes sparse neural networks in the
infinite-width regime. Our key insight is that connectivity patterns of sparse
neural networks induced by pruning methods converge to specific graphons as
networks' width tends to infinity, which encodes implicit structural biases of
different pruning methods. We postulate the Graphon Limit Hypothesis and
provide empirical evidence to support it. Leveraging this graphon
representation, we derive a Graphon Neural Tangent Kernel (Graphon NTK) to
study the training dynamics of sparse networks in the infinite width limit.
Graphon NTK provides a general framework for the theoretical analysis of sparse
networks. We empirically show that the spectral analysis of Graphon NTK
correlates with observed training dynamics of sparse networks, explaining the
varying convergence behaviours of different pruning methods. Our framework
provides theoretical insights into the impact of connectivity patterns on the
trainability of various sparse network architectures.

TL;DR: 提出了SAFE-D框架，用于检测帕金森病相关的驾驶行为异常，通过多源车辆控制数据构建行为档案，使用注意力网络识别时空特征，在模拟环境中达到96.8%的平均准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注功能性临时异常（如疲劳、分心），但缺乏对病理触发偏差的研究，特别是慢性疾病如帕金森病导致的驾驶行为变化，这对公共交通安全构成风险。

Method: 分析帕金森病症状学，建立与驾驶性能退化的因果关系；整合多车辆控制组件数据构建行为档案；设计基于注意力的网络自适应优先处理时空特征。

Result: 在Logitech G29平台和CARLA模拟器上验证，使用三个道路地图模拟真实驾驶，SAFE-D在区分正常和帕金森病影响驾驶模式方面达到96.8%的平均准确率。

Conclusion: SAFE-D框架能够有效检测帕金森病相关的驾驶行为异常，为提升驾驶安全提供了新方法，特别适用于早期帕金森病的亚临床行为变化检测。

Abstract: A driver's health state serves as a determinant factor in driving behavioral
regulation. Subtle deviations from normalcy can lead to operational anomalies,
posing risks to public transportation safety. While prior efforts have
developed detection mechanisms for functionally-driven temporary anomalies such
as drowsiness and distraction, limited research has addressed
pathologically-triggered deviations, especially those stemming from chronic
medical conditions. To bridge this gap, we investigate the driving behavior of
Parkinson's disease patients and propose SAFE-D, a novel framework for
detecting Parkinson-related behavioral anomalies to enhance driving safety. Our
methodology starts by performing analysis of Parkinson's disease
symptomatology, focusing on primary motor impairments, and establishes causal
links to degraded driving performance. To represent the subclinical behavioral
variations of early-stage Parkinson's disease, our framework integrates data
from multiple vehicle control components to build a behavioral profile. We then
design an attention-based network that adaptively prioritizes spatiotemporal
features, enabling robust anomaly detection under physiological variability.
Finally, we validate SAFE-D on the Logitech G29 platform and CARLA simulator,
using data from three road maps to emulate real-world driving. Our results show
SAFE-D achieves 96.8% average accuracy in distinguishing normal and
Parkinson-affected driving patterns.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出CD-GTMLL框架，将多标签学习建模为合作博弈，通过好奇心奖励机制解决长尾分布问题，在稀有标签上取得显著性能提升。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多标签学习中存在长尾不平衡问题：少数头部标签主导梯度信号，而实践中重要的许多稀有标签被忽视。

Method: 将标签空间分配给多个合作玩家，共享全局准确度收益，同时根据标签稀有度和玩家间分歧获得额外好奇心奖励，无需手动调整类别权重。

Result: 在常规基准和三个超大规模数据集上实现最先进性能，Rare-F1提升达+4.3%，P@3提升+1.6%，消融实验显示出现了劳动分工和稀有类别上更快的共识。

Conclusion: CD-GTMLL为多标签预测中的长尾鲁棒性提供了一条原则性、可扩展的路径。

Abstract: Long-tail imbalance is endemic to multi-label learning: a few head labels
dominate the gradient signal, while the many rare labels that matter in
practice are silently ignored. We tackle this problem by casting the task as a
cooperative potential game. In our Curiosity-Driven Game-Theoretic Multi-Label
Learning (CD-GTMLL) framework, the label space is split among several
cooperating players that share a global accuracy payoff yet earn additional
curiosity rewards that rise with label rarity and inter-player disagreement.
These curiosity bonuses inject gradient on under-represented tags without
hand-tuned class weights. We prove that gradient best-response updates ascend a
differentiable potential and converge to tail-aware stationary points that
tighten a lower bound on the expected Rare-F1. Extensive experiments on
conventional benchmarks and three extreme-scale datasets show consistent
state-of-the-art gains, delivering up to +4.3% Rare-F1 and +1.6% P@3 over the
strongest baselines, while ablations reveal emergent division of labour and
faster consensus on rare classes. CD-GTMLL thus offers a principled, scalable
route to long-tail robustness in multi-label prediction.

TL;DR: 提出Counterfactual Knowledge Distillation (CFKD)框架，通过生成多样反事实样本来解决深度学习中虚假相关性问题，无需组标签即可实现跨组平衡泛化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习模型容易受到虚假相关性的影响，现有方法如DFR依赖显式组标签且面临组标签不可得、组内样本少、多虚假相关性导致性能下降等问题。

Method: 通过生成多样反事实样本，让人类标注者高效探索和修正模型决策边界，通过知识蒸馏步骤不仅重加权欠采样组，还为其丰富新数据点。

Result: 在五个数据集上验证有效性，特别是在低数据量和高虚假相关性场景下表现优异，能有效扩展到多混淆变量。

Conclusion: CFKD无需混淆变量标签，能实现跨组平衡泛化，在工业应用中具有实用价值。

Abstract: Deep learning models remain vulnerable to spurious correlations, leading to
so-called Clever Hans predictors that undermine robustness even in large-scale
foundation and self-supervised models. Group distributional robustness methods,
such as Deep Feature Reweighting (DFR) rely on explicit group labels to
upweight underrepresented subgroups, but face key limitations: (1) group labels
are often unavailable, (2) low within-group sample sizes hinder coverage of the
subgroup distribution, and (3) performance degrades sharply when multiple
spurious correlations fragment the data into even smaller groups. We propose
Counterfactual Knowledge Distillation (CFKD), a framework that sidesteps these
issues by generating diverse counterfactuals, enabling a human annotator to
efficiently explore and correct the model's decision boundaries through a
knowledge distillation step. Unlike DFR, our method not only reweights the
undersampled groups, but it also enriches them with new data points. Our method
does not require any confounder labels, achieves effective scaling to multiple
confounders, and yields balanced generalization across groups. We demonstrate
CFKD's efficacy across five datasets, spanning synthetic tasks to an industrial
application, with particularly strong gains in low-data regimes with pronounced
spurious correlations. Additionally, we provide an ablation study on the effect
of the chosen counterfactual explainer and teacher model, highlighting their
impact on robustness.

*Wei Huang,Andi Han,Yujin Song,Yilan Chen,Denny Wu,Difan Zou,Taiji Suzuki*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 在低信噪比(SNR)数据中，通过向梯度下降算法添加标签噪声可以抑制噪声记忆，改善神经网络泛化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习模型容易在训练集中同时学习统计信号和过拟合噪声，特别是在低信噪比情况下，噪声记忆会损害泛化能力。受标签噪声提供隐式正则化的启发，研究是否在梯度更新中引入标签噪声能提升神经网络在低SNR场景下的测试性能。

Method: 使用标签噪声梯度下降(GD)算法训练两层神经网络，在理想的信号-噪声数据设置中进行分析。

Result: 标签噪声GD能抑制噪声记忆，防止其主导学习过程，实现快速信号增长同时控制过拟合，从而在低SNR下获得良好泛化。相比之下，标准GD在相同设置下倾向于过拟合噪声，其测试误差存在非零下界。

Conclusion: 在基于梯度的训练中引入标签噪声有助于改善神经网络在低信噪比数据上的泛化性能。

Abstract: The capacity of deep learning models is often large enough to both learn the
underlying statistical signal and overfit to noise in the training set. This
noise memorization can be harmful especially for data with a low
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), leading to poor generalization. Inspired by prior
observations that label noise provides implicit regularization that improves
generalization, in this work, we investigate whether introducing label noise to
the gradient updates can enhance the test performance of neural network (NN) in
the low SNR regime. Specifically, we consider training a two-layer NN with a
simple label noise gradient descent (GD) algorithm, in an idealized
signal-noise data setting. We prove that adding label noise during training
suppresses noise memorization, preventing it from dominating the learning
process; consequently, label noise GD enjoys rapid signal growth while the
overfitting remains controlled, thereby achieving good generalization despite
the low SNR. In contrast, we also show that NN trained with standard GD tends
to overfit to noise in the same low SNR setting and establish a non-vanishing
lower bound on its test error, thus demonstrating the benefit of introducing
label noise in gradient-based training.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于保形对齐的级联机制(CAb)，确保边缘预测集在条件覆盖度上达到云模型水平，同时减少向云的卸载并控制风险水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 边缘智能虽然能实现低延迟推理，但保证可靠性仍然具有挑战性。需要确保边缘预测集在条件覆盖度上达到云模型的水平，同时控制向云端的卸载率。

Method: 将边缘到云的升级建模为多重假设检验问题，采用保形对齐方法选择可以在边缘安全处理的输入。该方法适用于任意边缘预测集，包括各种保形预测变体。

Result: 在CIFAR-100图像分类和TeleQnA问答基准测试中，CAb级联方法在保持目标条件覆盖度的同时，显著减少了向云的卸载，预测集大小仅适度增加。

Conclusion: CAb级联机制能够为边缘决策提供统计保证，在覆盖度、延迟率和集合大小之间实现可调权衡，有效提升了边缘智能的可靠性。

Abstract: Edge intelligence enables low-latency inference via compact on-device models,
but assuring reliability remains challenging. We study edge-cloud cascades that
must preserve conditional coverage: whenever the edge returns a prediction set,
it should contain the true label with a user-specified probability, as if
produced by the cloud model. We formalize conditional coverage with respect to
the cloud predictive distribution, and introduce a conformal alignment-based
(CAb) cascading mechanism that certifies this property with user control over
the risk level. Our method casts escalation from edge to cloud models as a
multiple-hypothesis testing (MHT) problem, tailoring conformal alignment (CA)
to select which inputs can be safely handled at the edge. The proposed CAb
model cascading method yields statistical guarantees on the average fraction of
edge decisions that satisfy cloud-level conditional coverage. The procedure
applies to arbitrary edge prediction sets, including variants of conformal
prediction (CP), and exposes a tunable trade-off among coverage, deferral rate,
and set size. Experiments on CIFAR-100 image classification and the TeleQnA
question-answering (QA) benchmark show that the proposed CAb cascade maintains
the target conditional coverage for edge predictions while substantially
reducing offloading to the cloud and incurring modest increases in
prediction-set size.

TL;DR: TrajMamba是一个用于车辆GPS轨迹学习的新方法，通过联合建模GPS和道路视角来捕捉移动模式，集成旅行目的到嵌入中，并使用知识蒸馏减少轨迹冗余，在效率和准确性上都优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 车辆GPS轨迹包含有价值的旅行语义信息，但现有方法面临两个主要挑战：旅行目的与道路功能和POI相关，这些文本信息建模计算负担重；真实轨迹包含冗余点，影响计算效率和嵌入质量。

Method: 提出TrajMamba方法，包含Traj-Mamba编码器联合建模GPS和道路视角，旅行目的感知预训练将旅行目的集成到嵌入中，以及知识蒸馏预训练通过可学习掩码生成器识别关键轨迹点来压缩轨迹嵌入。

Conclusion: TrajMamba能够有效且高效地学习车辆轨迹的旅行语义，解决了轨迹数据建模中的计算负担和冗余问题，为轨迹数据的实际应用提供了有力支持。

Abstract: Vehicle GPS trajectories record how vehicles move over time, storing valuable
travel semantics, including movement patterns and travel purposes. Learning
travel semantics effectively and efficiently is crucial for real-world
applications of trajectory data, which is hindered by two major challenges.
First, travel purposes are tied to the functions of the roads and
points-of-interest (POIs) involved in a trip. Such information is encoded in
textual addresses and descriptions and introduces heavy computational burden to
modeling. Second, real-world trajectories often contain redundant points, which
harm both computational efficiency and trajectory embedding quality. To address
these challenges, we propose TrajMamba, a novel approach for efficient and
semantically rich vehicle trajectory learning. TrajMamba introduces a
Traj-Mamba Encoder that captures movement patterns by jointly modeling both GPS
and road perspectives of trajectories, enabling robust representations of
continuous travel behaviors. It also incorporates a Travel Purpose-aware
Pre-training procedure to integrate travel purposes into the learned embeddings
without introducing extra overhead to embedding calculation. To reduce
redundancy in trajectories, TrajMamba features a Knowledge Distillation
Pre-training scheme to identify key trajectory points through a learnable mask
generator and obtain effective compressed trajectory embeddings. Extensive
experiments on two real-world datasets and three downstream tasks show that
TrajMamba outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both efficiency and
accuracy.

Motivation: 时间序列中的未检测异常可能导致安全关键系统的灾难性故障，而现有检测方法的性能评估存在缺陷，因为当前指标仅捕捉任务的狭窄方面且常产生误导性结果。

Method: 引入验证性属性来形式化评估时间序列异常检测的基本要求，建立理论框架支持原则性评估和可靠比较，分析37个广泛使用的指标，并提出LARM和ALARM两个新指标。

Conclusion: 提出的LARM和ALARM指标可证明满足所有属性，能够填补现有评估指标的空白，提供更可靠的异常检测评估方法。

Abstract: Undetected anomalies in time series can trigger catastrophic failures in
safety-critical systems, such as chemical plant explosions or power grid
outages. Although many detection methods have been proposed, their performance
remains unclear because current metrics capture only narrow aspects of the task
and often yield misleading results. We address this issue by introducing
verifiable properties that formalize essential requirements for evaluating
time-series anomaly detection. These properties enable a theoretical framework
that supports principled evaluations and reliable comparisons. Analyzing 37
widely used metrics, we show that most satisfy only a few properties, and none
satisfy all, explaining persistent inconsistencies in prior results. To close
this gap, we propose LARM, a flexible metric that provably satisfies all
properties, and extend it to ALARM, an advanced variant meeting stricter
requirements.

Conclusion: 拉格朗日乘子选择缺乏通用直觉，自动更新能有效工作但需要进一步研究稳定化方法。

Abstract: In safety-critical domains such as robotics, navigation and power systems,
constrained optimization problems arise where maximizing performance must be
carefully balanced with associated constraints. Safe reinforcement learning
provides a framework to address these challenges, with Lagrangian methods being
a popular choice. However, the effectiveness of Lagrangian methods crucially
depends on the choice of the Lagrange multiplier $\lambda$, which governs the
trade-off between return and constraint cost. A common approach is to update
the multiplier automatically during training. Although this is standard in
practice, there remains limited empirical evidence on the robustness of an
automated update and its influence on overall performance. Therefore, we
analyze (i) optimality and (ii) stability of Lagrange multipliers in safe
reinforcement learning across a range of tasks. We provide $\lambda$-profiles
that give a complete visualization of the trade-off between return and
constraint cost of the optimization problem. These profiles show the highly
sensitive nature of $\lambda$ and moreover confirm the lack of general
intuition for choosing the optimal value $\lambda^*$. Our findings additionally
show that automated multiplier updates are able to recover and sometimes even
exceed the optimal performance found at $\lambda^*$ due to the vast difference
in their learning trajectories. Furthermore, we show that automated multiplier
updates exhibit oscillatory behavior during training, which can be mitigated
through PID-controlled updates. However, this method requires careful tuning to
achieve consistently better performance across tasks. This highlights the need
for further research on stabilizing Lagrangian methods in safe reinforcement
learning. The code used to reproduce our results can be found at

Conclusion: 降维压缩设计空间有助于优化，提高可解释性，且可用理化性质有效组织潜在空间来改善抗菌肽设计。

Abstract: Antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) are a promising class of therapeutics to treat
bacterial infections. Discovering and designing such peptides is difficult
because of the vast number of possible sequences of amino acids. Deep
generative models, such as variational autoencoders, have shown value in
peptide design due to their ability to model sequence space with a
continuous-valued latent space. Although such models have already been used to
great effect in biomolecular design, they still suffer from a lack of
interpretability and rigorous quantification of latent space quality as a
search space. We investigate (1) whether further compression of the design
space via dimensionality reduction may facilitate optimization, (2) the
interpretability of the spaces, and (3) how organizing latent spaces with
physicochemical properties may improve the efficiency of optimizing
antimicrobial activity. We find that further reduction of the latent space via
dimensionality reduction can be advantageous when organizing the space with
more relevant information at data availability, that using the dimensionality
reduction search space can be more interpretable, and that we can organize the
latent space with different physicochemical properties even at different
percentages of available labels.

Conclusion: CEPerFed能够有效应对联邦学习中的数据异构性和通信开销挑战，为多脉冲MRI分类等临床应用提供可行解决方案。

Abstract: Multi-pulse magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is widely utilized for clinical
practice such as Alzheimer's disease diagnosis. To train a robust model for
multi-pulse MRI classification, it requires large and diverse data from various
medical institutions while protecting privacy by preventing raw data sharing
across institutions. Although federated learning (FL) is a feasible solution to
address this issue, it poses challenges of model convergence due to the effect
of data heterogeneity and substantial communication overhead due to large
numbers of parameters transmitted within the model. To address these
challenges, we propose CEPerFed, a communication-efficient personalized FL
method. It mitigates the effect of data heterogeneity by incorporating
client-side historical risk gradients and historical mean gradients to
coordinate local and global optimization. The former is used to weight the
contributions from other clients, enhancing the reliability of local updates,
while the latter enforces consistency between local updates and the global
optimization direction to ensure stable convergence across heterogeneous data
distributions. To address the high communication overhead, we propose a
hierarchical SVD (HSVD) strategy that transmits only the most critical
information required for model updates. Experiments on five classification
tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of the CEPerFed method. The code will be
released upon acceptance at https://github.com/LD0416/CEPerFed.

Motivation: 自杀预测是预防的关键，但真实数据中阳性样本稀少，导致极端的类别不平衡问题，这促使研究者寻求数据增强方法来改善模型性能。

Method: 使用机器学习模型（包括可解释数据模型和黑盒算法模型）和深度学习技术，特别是生成对抗网络（GAN）来生成合成数据样本以增强数据集。初始数据集包含656个样本，其中只有4个阳性案例。

Result: 在真实测试数据上：逻辑回归的加权精度0.99、召回率0.85、F1分数0.91；随机森林分别为0.98、0.99、0.99；支持向量机为0.99、0.76、0.86。逻辑回归和支持向量机正确识别了1个自杀尝试案例（敏感度1.0），但分别误分类了20和31个非尝试案例。

Conclusion: 研究结果表明这些模型在自杀预测方面具有有效性，GAN在生成合成数据以支持自杀预防建模工作中发挥了关键作用。

Abstract: Suicide prediction is the key for prevention, but real data with sufficient
positive samples is rare and causes extreme class imbalance. We utilized
machine learning (ML) to build the model and deep learning (DL) techniques,
like Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN), to generate synthetic data samples
to enhance the dataset. The initial dataset contained 656 samples, with only
four positive cases, prompting the need for data augmentation. A variety of
machine learning models, ranging from interpretable data models to black box
algorithmic models, were used. On real test data, Logistic Regression (LR)
achieved a weighted precision of 0.99, a weighted recall of 0.85, and a
weighted F1 score of 0.91; Random Forest (RF) showed 0.98, 0.99, and 0.99,
respectively; and Support Vector Machine (SVM) achieved 0.99, 0.76, and 0.86.
LR and SVM correctly identified one suicide attempt case (sensitivity:1.0) and
misclassified LR(20) and SVM (31) non-attempts as attempts (specificity: 0.85 &
0.76, respectively). RF identified 0 suicide attempt cases (sensitivity: 0.0)
with 0 false positives (specificity: 1.0). These results highlight the models'
effectiveness, with GAN playing a key role in generating synthetic data to
support suicide prevention modeling efforts.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实应用中，反馈对于将复杂、细微或主观目标转化为可量化的优化目标至关重要。传统方法只能接受受限的反馈格式，需要为每个领域特定问题定制模型。

Method: 利用大语言模型将各种类型的文本反馈转化为一致的效用信号，并轻松包含灵活的用户先验，无需手动设计核函数。同时保持贝叶斯优化的样本效率和原则性不确定性量化。

Result: 该混合方法不仅为决策者提供了更自然的接口，而且在反馈受限的情况下优于传统贝叶斯优化基线和仅使用LLM的优化器。

Conclusion: 语言在环框架成功地将自然语言反馈与贝叶斯优化结合，在保持样本效率的同时提供了更灵活的用户交互方式。

Abstract: For many real-world applications, feedback is essential in translating
complex, nuanced, or subjective goals into quantifiable optimization
objectives. We propose a language-in-the-loop framework that uses a large
language model (LLM) to convert unstructured feedback in the form of natural
language into scalar utilities to conduct BO over a numeric search space.
Unlike preferential BO, which only accepts restricted feedback formats and
requires customized models for each domain-specific problem, our approach
leverages LLMs to turn varied types of textual feedback into consistent utility
signals and to easily include flexible user priors without manual kernel
design. At the same time, our method maintains the sample efficiency and
principled uncertainty quantification of BO. We show that this hybrid method
not only provides a more natural interface to the decision maker but also
outperforms conventional BO baselines and LLM-only optimizers, particularly in
feedback-limited regimes.

Abstract: This dissertation makes three main contributions. First, We identify a new
connection between policy gradient and dynamic programming in MMDPs and propose
the Coordinate Ascent Dynamic Programming (CADP) algorithm to compute a Markov
policy that maximizes the discounted return averaged over the uncertain models.
CADP adjusts model weights iteratively to guarantee monotone policy
improvements to a local maximum. Second, We establish sufficient and necessary
conditions for the exponential ERM Bellman operator to be a contraction and
prove the existence of stationary deterministic optimal policies for ERM-TRC
and EVaR-TRC. We also propose exponential value iteration, policy iteration,
and linear programming algorithms for computing optimal stationary policies for
ERM-TRC and EVaR-TRC. Third, We propose model-free Q-learning algorithms for
computing policies with risk-averse objectives: ERM-TRC and EVaR-TRC. The
challenge is that Q-learning ERM Bellman may not be a contraction. Instead, we
use the monotonicity of Q-learning ERM Bellman operators to derive a rigorous
proof that the ERM-TRC and the EVaR-TRC Q-learning algorithms converge to the
optimal risk-averse value functions. The proposed Q-learning algorithms compute
the optimal stationary policy for ERM-TRC and EVaR-TRC.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的Sim2Real框架，通过双层强化学习直接基于真实世界性能调整模拟器参数，以缩小Sim2Real性能差距


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前Sim2Real方法通过优化模拟器精度和变异性作为代理指标，但这些指标与策略在真实世界中的性能不一定相关，导致模拟训练的策略在真实部署时性能显著下降

Method: 采用双层强化学习框架：内层RL在模拟环境中训练策略，外层RL调整模拟模型和模拟内奖励参数，以最大化模拟策略在真实世界中的性能

Result: 推导并验证了开发能够缩小Sim2Real性能差距的双层RL算法所需的数学工具

Conclusion: 该框架通过直接基于真实世界性能优化模拟器参数，为解决Sim2Real性能差距问题提供了新途径

Abstract: Sim2Real aims at training policies in high-fidelity simulation environments
and effectively transferring them to the real world. Despite the developments
of accurate simulators and Sim2Real RL approaches, the policies trained purely
in simulation often suffer significant performance drops when deployed in real
environments. This drop is referred to as the Sim2Real performance gap. Current
Sim2Real RL methods optimize the simulator accuracy and variability as proxies
for real-world performance. However, these metrics do not necessarily correlate
with the real-world performance of the policy as established theoretically and
empirically in the literature. We propose a novel framework to address this
issue by directly adapting the simulator parameters based on real-world
performance. We frame this problem as a bi-level RL framework: the inner-level
RL trains a policy purely in simulation, and the outer-level RL adapts the
simulation model and in-sim reward parameters to maximize real-world
performance of the in-sim policy. We derive and validate in simple examples the
mathematical tools needed to develop bi-level RL algorithms that close the
Sim2Real performance gap.

TL;DR: 本文研究如何提升黑盒大语言模型作为分类器的操作粒度，通过分析其低基数输出问题，提出有效方法在不损失性能的情况下显著增加可用操作点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 黑盒LLMs虽然易于使用，但在需要特定指标约束的应用中表现不佳，主要因为其数值输出基数低，限制了操作点的精细调整能力。

Method: 首先分析LLMs低基数输出的原因，发现其倾向于生成四舍五入但信息丰富的语言化概率；然后实验标准提示工程、不确定性估计和置信度激发技术；最后提出有效方法来显著增加可用操作点的数量和多样性。

Result: 在11个数据集和3个LLMs上的实验表明，所提方法提供了更细粒度的操作点，性能与基准方法相当或更好。

Conclusion: 提出的方法能有效提升黑盒LLMs的操作粒度，使其在需要精确指标约束的决策应用中更具实用性。

Abstract: Black-box Large Language Models (LLMs) provide practical and accessible
alternatives to other machine learning methods, as they require minimal labeled
data and machine learning expertise to develop solutions for various decision
making problems. However, for applications that need operating with constraints
on specific metrics (e.g., precision $\geq$ 95%), decision making with
black-box LLMs remains unfavorable, due to their low numerical output
cardinalities. This results in limited control over their operating points,
preventing fine-grained adjustment of their decision making behavior. In this
paper, we study using black-box LLMs as classifiers, focusing on efficiently
improving their operational granularity without performance loss. Specifically,
we first investigate the reasons behind their low-cardinality numerical outputs
and show that they are biased towards generating rounded but informative
verbalized probabilities. Then, we experiment with standard prompt engineering,
uncertainty estimation and confidence elicitation techniques, and observe that
they do not effectively improve operational granularity without sacrificing
performance or increasing inference cost. Finally, we propose efficient
approaches to significantly increase the number and diversity of available
operating points. Our proposed approaches provide finer-grained operating
points and achieve comparable to or better performance than the benchmark
methods across 11 datasets and 3 LLMs.

TL;DR: 开发物理信息神经网络(PINN)策略，将海冰物理知识集成到机器学习模型中，用于预测北极海冰速度和浓度，相比纯数据驱动模型表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 纯数据驱动的机器学习模型在泛化性和物理一致性方面存在局限性，特别是在北极海冰变薄和加速融化的新阶段，历史数据训练的模型可能无法充分代表未来动态变化的海冰条件。

Method: 基于分层信息共享U-net架构，整合物理损失函数和激活函数，生成物理上合理的海冰速度和浓度输出。

Result: PINN模型在海冰速度和浓度的日预测中优于纯数据驱动模型，即使使用少量样本训练也能表现良好，特别是在融化和早期冻结季节以及快速移动冰区显著改善了海冰浓度预测。

Conclusion: 物理信息神经网络方法能够有效整合物理知识，提高海冰预测的准确性和物理一致性，在数据稀缺情况下仍能保持良好性能。

Abstract: As an increasing amount of remote sensing data becomes available in the
Arctic Ocean, data-driven machine learning (ML) techniques are becoming widely
used to predict sea ice velocity (SIV) and sea ice concentration (SIC).
However, fully data-driven ML models have limitations in generalizability and
physical consistency due to their excessive reliance on the quantity and
quality of training data. In particular, as Arctic sea ice entered a new phase
with thinner ice and accelerated melting, there is a possibility that an ML
model trained with historical sea ice data cannot fully represent the
dynamically changing sea ice conditions in the future. In this study, we
develop physics-informed neural network (PINN) strategies to integrate physical
knowledge of sea ice into the ML model. Based on the Hierarchical
Information-sharing U-net (HIS-Unet) architecture, we incorporate the physics
loss function and the activation function to produce physically plausible SIV
and SIC outputs. Our PINN model outperforms the fully data-driven model in the
daily predictions of SIV and SIC, even when trained with a small number of
samples. The PINN approach particularly improves SIC predictions in melting and
early freezing seasons and near fast-moving ice regions.

Motivation: 当前流形学习方法主要关注降维到欧氏空间，会丢失流形关键特征。直接学习潜在流形作为微分图册的方法相对未被充分探索，本文旨在证明此类方法的有效性和潜力。

Method: 实现了一个通用数据结构来维护可微分图册，支持流形上的黎曼优化，并提出了从点云数据学习可微分图册的无监督启发式方法。

Result: 实验证明该方法在选定场景下具有效率和准确性优势，在Klein瓶上的监督分类任务和造血数据的RNA速度分析中展示了更好的可解释性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 基于图册的流形学习方法具有显著优势，为直接在潜在数据流形上进行机器学习提供了有效途径。

Abstract: Despite the popularity of the manifold hypothesis, current manifold-learning
methods do not support machine learning directly on the latent $d$-dimensional
data manifold, as they primarily aim to perform dimensionality reduction into
$\mathbb{R}^D$, losing key manifold features when the embedding dimension $D$
approaches $d$.
  On the other hand, methods that directly learn the latent manifold as a
differentiable atlas have been relatively underexplored.
  In this paper, we aim to give a proof of concept of the effectiveness and
potential of atlas-based methods. To this end, we implement a generic data
structure to maintain a differentiable atlas that enables Riemannian
optimization over the manifold. We complement this with an unsupervised
heuristic that learns a differentiable atlas from point cloud data. We
experimentally demonstrate that this approach has advantages in terms of
efficiency and accuracy in selected settings. Moreover, in a supervised
classification task over the Klein bottle and in RNA velocity analysis of
hematopoietic data, we showcase the improved interpretability and robustness of
our approach.

*Jackson Harmon,Andreas Hochlehnert,Matthias Bethge,Ameya Prabhu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一个样本级别的框架来量化后训练过程中的知识遗忘和反向迁移，通过分析1->0和0->1的转换来测量不同后训练阶段对预训练知识的影响。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 规模化后训练在语言模型中带来了显著能力提升，但其对预训练知识的影响尚未被充分理解。传统任务平均值会混淆遗忘和反向迁移效应，需要更精细的测量方法。

Method: 提出样本级别的测量范式，统计1->0转换（后训练前正确后错误）来量化遗忘，0->1转换来量化反向迁移。对于多项选择题，还提出了机会调整变体来消除随机猜测的影响。

Result: 大规模分析发现：领域持续预训练导致中度遗忘和低到中度反向迁移；RL/SFT后训练在数学和逻辑上产生中到大的反向迁移，总体低到中度遗忘；对指令调优模型应用RL/SFT在数据规模上敏感；模型融合不能可靠缓解遗忘。

Conclusion: 该框架为映射后训练如何改变预训练知识提供了实用标准，有助于推进通用AI系统的发展。

Abstract: Scaled post-training now drives many of the largest capability gains in
language models (LMs), yet its effect on pretrained knowledge remains poorly
understood. Not all forgetting is equal: Forgetting one fact (e.g., a U.S.
president or an API call) does not "average out" by recalling another. Hence,
we propose a sample-wise paradigm to measure what is forgotten and when
backward transfer occurs. Our metric counts 1->0 transitions (correct before
post-training, incorrect after) to quantify forgetting and 0->1 transitions to
quantify backward transfer. Traditional task averages conflate these effects
and obscure large changes. For multiple-choice benchmarks, we add
chance-adjusted variants that subtract the expected contribution of random
guessing from pre- and post-training accuracies. We apply this framework across
post-training stages, model sizes, and data scales. Our large-scale analysis
shows that: (1) Domain-continual pretraining induces moderate forgetting with
low-to-moderate backward transfer; (2) RL/SFT post-training applied to base
models and Instruction tuning yields moderate-to-large backward transfer on
math and logic with overall low-to-moderate forgetting; (3) Applying RL/SFT to
instruction-tuned models is sensitive on data scale: at small scales, both
forgetting and backward transfer are small; at larger scales, effects are mixed
and warrant further study with better controls; (4) Model merging does not
reliably mitigate forgetting. Overall, our framework offers a practical
yardstick for mapping how post-training alters pretrained knowledge at scale --
enabling progress towards generally capable AI systems.

TL;DR: 提出了在推理时保持线性插值的流匹配缩放方法，在图像和蛋白质生成任务上验证了推理计算增加能持续提升样本质量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有流匹配方法在推理时缩放计算的研究不足，且现有方法会牺牲FM的高效直线采样特性，需要开发保持线性插值的推理缩放方法

Method: 引入新颖的推理时缩放程序，在采样过程中保持线性插值，应用于图像生成和无条件蛋白质生成

Result: 样本质量随推理计算增加而持续提升，首次证明流匹配推理时缩放可应用于科学领域

Conclusion: 提出的方法成功保持了流匹配的高效采样特性，同时实现了推理时计算的可扩展性，为科学领域的生成任务提供了有效工具

Abstract: Allocating extra computation at inference time has recently improved sample
quality in large language models and diffusion-based image generation. In
parallel, Flow Matching (FM) has gained traction in language, vision, and
scientific domains, but inference-time scaling methods for it remain
under-explored. Concurrently, Kim et al., 2025 approach this problem but
replace the linear interpolant with a non-linear variance-preserving (VP)
interpolant at inference, sacrificing FM's efficient and straight sampling.
Additionally, inference-time compute scaling for flow matching has only been
applied to visual tasks, like image generation. We introduce novel
inference-time scaling procedures for FM that preserve the linear interpolant
during sampling. Evaluations of our method on image generation, and for the
first time (to the best of our knowledge), unconditional protein generation,
show that I) sample quality consistently improves as inference compute
increases, and II) flow matching inference-time scaling can be applied to
scientific domains.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代概率回归器在分布偏移下往往保持过度自信，需要一种能够自适应调整预测不确定性的方法。

Method: 使用beta-ELBO和蒙特卡洛采样训练FDN，这是一种输入条件化的网络权重分布，能够诱导预测混合的离散度根据输入自适应调整。

Result: 在标准回归任务上，与强大的贝叶斯、集成、dropout和超网络基线在匹配参数和更新预算下进行基准测试，评估准确性、校准和偏移感知能力。

Conclusion: 该框架和评估协议旨在使OOD感知、良好校准的神经回归变得实用和模块化。

Abstract: Modern probabilistic regressors often remain overconfident under distribution
shift. We present Functional Distribution Networks (FDN), an input-conditioned
distribution over network weights that induces predictive mixtures whose
dispersion adapts to the input. FDN is trained with a beta-ELBO and Monte Carlo
sampling. We further propose an evaluation protocol that cleanly separates
interpolation from extrapolation and stresses OOD sanity checks (e.g., that
predictive likelihood degrades under shift while in-distribution accuracy and
calibration are maintained). On standard regression tasks, we benchmark against
strong Bayesian, ensemble, dropout, and hypernetwork baselines under matched
parameter and update budgets, and assess accuracy, calibration, and
shift-awareness with standard diagnostics. Together, the framework and protocol
aim to make OOD-aware, well-calibrated neural regression practical and modular.

TL;DR: 提出了GaLore Unbiased with Muon (GUM)方法，通过层间采样技术消除低秩投影偏差，在保持内存效率的同时实现收敛保证，在LLM微调和预训练中表现优于GaLore甚至全参数训练。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有低秩优化方法缺乏收敛保证的问题，因为各种低秩投影方法相对于原始优化算法存在固有偏差，导致与全参数训练存在性能差距。

Method: 基于GaLore机制和Muon算法，采用层间采样技术来消除低秩投影偏差，开发了GUM方法。

Result: 理论上证明GUM方法匹配基础Muon算法的收敛保证，同时保持低秩技术的内存效率。实证实验显示在LLM微调和预训练中比GaLore有显著改进，甚至优于全参数训练。

Conclusion: 该技术的改进来自于层内知识分布更均匀，导致模型参数空间利用更高效和记忆能力更好。

Abstract: Memory-efficient optimization is critical for training increasingly large
language models (LLMs). A popular strategy involves gradient low-rank
projection, storing only the projected optimizer states, with GaLore being a
representative example. However, a significant drawback of many such methods is
their lack of convergence guarantees, as various low-rank projection approaches
introduce inherent biases relative to the original optimization algorithms,
which contribute to performance gaps compared to full-parameter training.
Aiming to tackle this problem, this paper investigates the layerwise sampling
technique for debiasing low-rank projection mechanisms. In particular, an
instantiation of the paradigm gives rise to a novel and unbiased low-rank
optimization method built upon GaLore's mechanism and the Muon algorithm, named
GaLore Unbiased with Muon (GUM). We theoretically prove our method matches the
convergence guarantees of the base Muon algorithm while preserving the memory
efficiency of low-rank techniques. Empirical experiments on LLM fine-tuning and
pretraining also demonstrate non-trivial improvements over GaLore and even
better performance than full-parameter training. Further investigation shows
that the improvement of this technique comes from a more uniform distribution
of knowledge inside layers, leading to more efficient utilization of the model
parameter space and better memorization.

TL;DR: VisuoAlign是一个通过提示引导树搜索实现多模态安全对齐的框架，能够显著提升大型视觉语言模型对抗复杂跨模态威胁的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型在多模态感知和生成方面取得了显著进展，但其安全对齐仍然是一个关键挑战。现有防御方法容易受到多模态越狱攻击，因为视觉输入引入了新的攻击面，推理链缺乏安全监督，且模态融合往往会降低对齐效果。

Method: VisuoAlign通过视觉-文本交互提示将安全约束嵌入推理过程，使用蒙特卡洛树搜索(MCTS)系统构建多样化的安全关键提示轨迹，并引入基于提示的缩放以确保实时风险检测和合规响应。

Result: 大量实验表明，VisuoAlign能够主动暴露风险，实现全面的数据集生成，并显著提高LVLMs对抗复杂跨模态威胁的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: VisuoAlign框架有效解决了多模态安全对齐的挑战，为大型视觉语言模型提供了强大的安全防护能力。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in
multimodal perception and generation, yet their safety alignment remains a
critical challenge.Existing defenses and vulnerable to multimodal jailbreaks,
as visual inputs introduce new attack surfaces, reasoning chains lack safety
supervision, and alignment often degrades under modality fusion.To overcome
these limitation, we propose VisuoAlign, a framework for multi-modal safety
alignment via prompt-guided tree search.VisuoAlign embeds safety constrains
into the reasoning process through visual-textual interactive prompts, employs
Monte Carlo Tree Search(MCTS) to systematically construct diverse
safety-critical prompt trajectories, and introduces prompt-based scaling to
ensure real-time risk detection and compliant responses.Extensive experiments
demonstrate that VisuoAlign proactively exposes risks, enables comprehensive
dataset generation, and significantly improves the robustness of LVLMs against
complex cross-modal threats.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型缺乏真正的认知理解，暴露了认知架构的缺失。传统AI研究关注"什么是智能"的本体论问题，而SCL关注"在什么条件下认知涌现"的认知论问题。

Method: 基于心智哲学和认知现象学，结合过程哲学、具身认知和扩展心智理论，将智能定义为执行过程——判断、记忆、控制、行动和调节的连续循环。

Result: SCL将哲学洞见操作化为可计算结构，支持"可执行认知论"；功能分离的认知架构比单一提示系统产生更一致和可解释的行为；重新定义智能为重建自身认知状态的能力。

Conclusion: SCL框架影响心智哲学、认知论和AI领域，将知识定义为在现象学一致循环中的连续重建，而非真理占有。真正的进步需要实现认知原则的架构，而非更大的模型。

Abstract: Large language models exhibit intelligence without genuine epistemic
understanding, exposing a key gap: the absence of epistemic architecture. This
paper introduces the Structured Cognitive Loop (SCL) as an executable
epistemological framework for emergent intelligence. Unlike traditional AI
research asking "what is intelligence?" (ontological), SCL asks "under what
conditions does cognition emerge?" (epistemological). Grounded in philosophy of
mind and cognitive phenomenology, SCL bridges conceptual philosophy and
implementable cognition. Drawing on process philosophy, enactive cognition, and
extended mind theory, we define intelligence not as a property but as a
performed process -- a continuous loop of judgment, memory, control, action,
and regulation. SCL makes three contributions. First, it operationalizes
philosophical insights into computationally interpretable structures, enabling
"executable epistemology" -- philosophy as structural experiment. Second, it
shows that functional separation within cognitive architecture yields more
coherent and interpretable behavior than monolithic prompt based systems,
supported by agent evaluations. Third, it redefines intelligence: not
representational accuracy but the capacity to reconstruct its own epistemic
state through intentional understanding. This framework impacts philosophy of
mind, epistemology, and AI. For philosophy, it allows theories of cognition to
be enacted and tested. For AI, it grounds behavior in epistemic structure
rather than statistical regularity. For epistemology, it frames knowledge not
as truth possession but as continuous reconstruction within a
phenomenologically coherent loop. We situate SCL within debates on cognitive
phenomenology, emergence, normativity, and intentionality, arguing that real
progress requires not larger models but architectures that realize cognitive
principles structurally.

Abstract: Citiverses hold the potential to support regulatory learning by offering
immersive, virtual environments for experimenting with policy scenarios and
technologies. This paper proposes a science-for-policy agenda to explore the
potential of citiverses as experimentation spaces for regulatory learning,
grounded in a consultation with a high-level panel of experts, including
policymakers from the European Commission, national government science advisers
and leading researchers in digital regulation and virtual worlds. It identifies
key research areas, including scalability, real-time feedback, complexity
modelling, cross-border collaboration, risk reduction, citizen participation,
ethical considerations and the integration of emerging technologies. In
addition, the paper analyses a set of experimental topics, spanning
transportation, urban planning and the environment/climate crisis, that could
be tested in citiverse platforms to advance regulatory learning in these areas.
The proposed work is designed to inform future research for policy and
emphasizes a responsible approach to developing and using citiverses. It
prioritizes careful consideration of the ethical, economic, ecological and
social dimensions of different regulations. The paper also explores essential
preliminary steps necessary for integrating citiverses into the broader

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI代理记忆系统缺乏对多样化任务的适应性，且忽视了记忆的建构性和任务导向作用。受皮亚杰认知发展理论启发，需要开发更具适应性和建构性的记忆系统。

Method: 提出PISA系统，包含三模态适应机制（图式更新、图式演化和图式创建）来保持记忆的连贯组织，并设计了结合符号推理和神经检索的混合记忆访问架构。

Result: 在LOCOMO基准和新提出的AggQA数据分析任务基准上的实证评估表明，PISA在适应性和长期知识保持方面达到了新的最先进水平。

Conclusion: PISA通过将记忆视为建构性和适应性过程，成功解决了现有记忆系统的局限性，为AI代理提供了更有效的记忆管理方案。

Abstract: Memory systems are fundamental to AI agents, yet existing work often lacks
adaptability to diverse tasks and overlooks the constructive and task-oriented
role of AI agent memory. Drawing from Piaget's theory of cognitive development,
we propose PISA, a pragmatic, psych-inspired unified memory system that
addresses these limitations by treating memory as a constructive and adaptive
process. To enable continuous learning and adaptability, PISA introduces a
trimodal adaptation mechanism (i.e., schema updation, schema evolution, and
schema creation) that preserves coherent organization while supporting flexible
memory updates. Building on these schema-grounded structures, we further design
a hybrid memory access architecture that seamlessly integrates symbolic
reasoning with neural retrieval, significantly improving retrieval accuracy and
efficiency. Our empirical evaluation, conducted on the existing LOCOMO
benchmark and our newly proposed AggQA benchmark for data analysis tasks,
confirms that PISA sets a new state-of-the-art by significantly enhancing
adaptability and long-term knowledge retention.

Motivation: 探索大型推理模型在解决复杂谜题时出现性能崩溃的原因，特别是验证是否由于模型需要自行跟踪状态空间导致的评估混淆。

Method: 为LLM提供汉诺塔问题的环境接口，允许其通过工具调用进行移动、提供书面理由、观察结果状态空间并重新提示下一步行动。

Result: 环境接口访问并不能延迟或消除性能崩溃，策略分析显示模型与最优策略和随机策略的偏离度增加，表现出模式崩溃。

Conclusion: 模型在复杂性增加时会出现模式崩溃，性能取决于模式是否反映问题的正确解决方案，类似现象可能也存在于大型推理模型中。

Abstract: Recent work reports that Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) undergo a collapse in
performance on solving puzzles beyond certain perplexity thresholds. In
subsequent discourse, questions have arisen as to whether the nature of the
task muddles an evaluation of true reasoning. One potential confound is the
requirement that the model keep track of the state space on its own. We provide
a large language model (LLM) with an environment interface for Tower of Hanoi
problems, allowing it to make a move with a tool call, provide written
justification, observe the resulting state space, and reprompt itself for the
next move. We observe that access to an environment interface does not delay or
eradicate performance collapse. Furthermore, LLM-parameterized policy analysis
reveals increasing divergence from both optimal policies and uniformly random
policies, suggesting that the model exhibits mode-like collapse at each level
of complexity, and that performance is dependent upon whether the mode reflects
the correct solution for the problem. We suggest that a similar phenomena might
take place in LRMs.

Abstract: We propose \textbf{Cognitive Load Traces} (CLTs) as a mid-level
interpretability framework for deep models, inspired by Cognitive Load Theory
in human cognition. CLTs are defined as symbolic, temporally varying functions
that quantify model-internal resource allocation. Formally, we represent CLTs
as a three-component stochastic process $(\mathrm{IL}_t, \mathrm{EL}_t,
\mathrm{GL}_t)$, corresponding to \emph{Intrinsic}, \emph{Extraneous}, and
\emph{Germane} load. Each component is instantiated through measurable proxies
such as attention entropy, KV-cache miss ratio, representation dispersion, and
decoding stability. We propose both symbolic formulations and visualization
methods (load curves, simplex diagrams) that enable interpretable analysis of
reasoning dynamics. Experiments on reasoning and planning benchmarks show that
CLTs predict error-onset, reveal cognitive strategies, and enable load-guided
interventions that improve reasoning efficiency by 15-30\% while maintaining
accuracy.

*Rafael Cabral,Tuan Manh Do,Xuejun Yu,Wai Ming Tai,Zijin Feng,Xin Shen*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ProofFlow是一个新的证明自动形式化流水线，通过构建逻辑依赖图和使用基于引理的方法来保持原始证明的结构保真度，在自动形式化任务上达到了新的最先进水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的自动形式化方法虽然能生成可执行代码，但经常无法保持原始人工编写证明的语义含义和逻辑结构，因此需要一种能够保持结构保真度的新方法。

Method: ProofFlow首先构建有向无环图(DAG)来映射证明步骤间的逻辑依赖关系，然后采用基于引理的方法系统地将每个步骤形式化为中间引理，从而保持原始论证的逻辑结构。

Result: 实验结果显示ProofFlow在自动形式化任务上达到了新的最先进水平，ProofScore得分为0.545，显著超过了全证明形式化(0.123)和步骤证明形式化(0.072)等基线方法。

Conclusion: ProofFlow通过关注结构保真度，在证明自动形式化任务上取得了显著改进，其流水线、基准测试和评分指标已开源以促进进一步研究。

Abstract: Proof autoformalization, the task of translating natural language theorems
and proofs into machine-verifiable code, is a critical step for integrating
large language models into rigorous mathematical workflows. Current approaches
focus on producing executable code, but they frequently fail to preserve the
semantic meaning and logical structure of the original human-written argument.
To address this, we introduce ProofFlow, a novel pipeline that treats
structural fidelity as a primary objective. ProofFlow first constructs a
directed acyclic graph (DAG) to map the logical dependencies between proof
steps. Then, it employs a novel lemma-based approach to systematically
formalize each step as an intermediate lemma, preserving the logical structure
of the original argument. To facilitate evaluation, we present a new benchmark
of 184 undergraduate-level problems, manually annotated with step-by-step
solutions and logical dependency graphs, and introduce ProofScore, a new
composite metric to evaluate syntactic correctness, semantic faithfulness, and
structural fidelity. Experimental results show our pipeline sets a new
state-of-the-art for autoformalization, achieving a ProofScore of 0.545,
substantially exceeding baselines like full-proof formalization (0.123), which
processes the entire proof at once, and step-proof formalization (0.072), which
handles each step independently. Our pipeline, benchmark, and score metric are
open-sourced to encourage further progress at

Abstract: An essential component for evaluating and comparing physical and cognitive
capabilities between populations is the testing of various factors related to
human performance. As a core part of sports science research, testing motor
performance enables the analysis of the physical health of different
demographic groups and makes them comparable.
  The Motor Research (MO|RE) data repository, developed at the Karlsruhe
Institute of Technology, is an infrastructure for publishing and archiving
research data in sports science, particularly in the field of motor performance
research. In this paper, we present our vision for creating a knowledge graph
from MO|RE data. With an ontology rooted in the Basic Formal Ontology, our
approach centers on formally representing the interrelation of plan
specifications, specific processes, and related measurements. Our goal is to
transform how motor performance data are modeled and shared across studies,
making it standardized and machine-understandable. The idea presented here is
developed within the Leibniz Science Campus ``Digital Transformation of
Research'' (DiTraRe).

*Ruolan Cheng,Yong Deng,Enrique Herrera-Viedma*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种用于随机置换集(RPS)的冲突度量方法，从随机有限集(RFS)和Dempster-Shafer理论(DST)两个角度分析RPS中的冲突，并基于秩偏重叠(RBO)度量定义了置换间的不一致性度量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在涉及顺序信息的不确定性推理中，随机置换集是一种新的形式化方法。如何度量由置换质量函数表示的两个证据之间的冲突仍然是顺序结构不确定信息融合中的迫切研究课题。

Method: 从置换观察出发，基于秩偏重叠(RBO)度量定义置换间的不一致性度量，进一步提出基于非重叠的RPS冲突度量方法。将RPS理论视为DST的扩展，新增的焦点集中顺序信息表示定性倾向性。

Result: 通过数值示例展示了所提冲突度量的行为和特性。该方法不仅具有自然的顶部加权特性，能从DST视角有效度量RPS间的冲突，还为决策者提供了权重、参数和截断深度的灵活选择。

Conclusion: 提出的方法为随机置换集中的冲突度量提供了有效的解决方案，结合了RFS和DST的视角，具有灵活性和实用性。

Abstract: Random permutation set (RPS) is a new formalism for reasoning with
uncertainty involving order information. Measuring the conflict between two
pieces of evidence represented by permutation mass functions remains an urgent
research topic in order-structured uncertain information fusion. In this paper,
a detailed analysis of conflicts in RPS is carried out from two different
perspectives: random finite set (RFS) and Dempster-Shafer theory (DST).
Starting from the observation of permutations, we first define an inconsistency
measure between permutations inspired by the rank-biased overlap(RBO) measure
and further propose a non-overlap-based conflict measure method for RPSs. This
paper regards RPS theory (RPST) as an extension of DST. The order information
newly added in focal sets indicates qualitative propensity, characterized by
top-ranked elements occupying a more critical position. Some numerical examples
are used to demonstrate the behavior and properties of the proposed conflict
measure. The proposed method not only has the natural top-weightedness property
and can effectively measure the conflict between RPSs from the DST view but
also provides decision-makers with a flexible selection of weights, parameters,
and truncated depths.

Motivation: 神经孪生作为神经代理的演进，旨在创建真实系统的数字副本，需要具备从测量中更新状态并保持轨迹跟踪的能力。

Method: 使用并行时间架构训练生成式神经网络建模状态分布，采用滑动窗口方式从测量中预测状态。

Result: 在二维湍流流体动力学问题上验证，PAINT能够保持轨迹跟踪，从稀疏测量中高保真预测系统状态。

Conclusion: PAINT具有开发保持轨迹跟踪的神经孪生的潜力，能够实现更准确的状态估计和决策制定。

Abstract: Neural surrogates have shown great potential in simulating dynamical systems,
while offering real-time capabilities. We envision Neural Twins as a
progression of neural surrogates, aiming to create digital replicas of real
systems. A neural twin consumes measurements at test time to update its state,
thereby enabling context-specific decision-making. A critical property of
neural twins is their ability to remain on-trajectory, i.e., to stay close to
the true system state over time. We introduce Parallel-in-time Neural Twins
(PAINT), an architecture-agnostic family of methods for modeling dynamical
systems from measurements. PAINT trains a generative neural network to model
the distribution of states parallel over time. At test time, states are
predicted from measurements in a sliding window fashion. Our theoretical
analysis shows that PAINT is on-trajectory, whereas autoregressive models
generally are not. Empirically, we evaluate our method on a challenging
two-dimensional turbulent fluid dynamics problem. The results demonstrate that
PAINT stays on-trajectory and predicts system states from sparse measurements
with high fidelity. These findings underscore PAINT's potential for developing
neural twins that stay on-trajectory, enabling more accurate state estimation
and decision-making.

TL;DR: 提出ISGFAN框架，通过信息分离和全局-局部对抗学习解决噪声干扰和领域偏移共存的跨域故障诊断问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有迁移故障诊断方法通常假设数据干净或领域相似性足够，但在工业环境中严重噪声干扰和领域偏移同时存在，限制了这些方法的有效性

Method: 基于信息分离架构，结合对抗学习和改进的正交损失来解耦领域不变故障表示；采用全局-局部领域对抗方案约束模型的联合和边缘分布

Result: 在三个公共基准数据集上的实验表明，该方法优于其他现有方法

Conclusion: ISGFAN框架在噪声条件下的跨域故障诊断中表现出优越性

Abstract: Existing transfer fault diagnosis methods typically assume either clean data
or sufficient domain similarity, which limits their effectiveness in industrial
environments where severe noise interference and domain shifts coexist. To
address this challenge, we propose an information separation global-focal
adversarial network (ISGFAN), a robust framework for cross-domain fault
diagnosis under noise conditions. ISGFAN is built on an information separation
architecture that integrates adversarial learning with an improved orthogonal
loss to decouple domain-invariant fault representation, thereby isolating noise
interference and domain-specific characteristics. To further strengthen
transfer robustness, ISGFAN employs a global-focal domain-adversarial scheme
that constrains both the conditional and marginal distributions of the model.
Specifically, the focal domain-adversarial component mitigates
category-specific transfer obstacles caused by noise in unsupervised scenarios,
while the global domain classifier ensures alignment of the overall
distribution. Experiments conducted on three public benchmark datasets
demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms other prominent existing
approaches, confirming the superiority of the ISGFAN framework. Data and code
are available at https://github.com/JYREN-Source/ISGFAN

*Ioan Hedea*

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种结合离线约束规划优化和在线时间网络执行的混合方法，为具有随机任务持续时间的制造系统创建在不确定性下仍可行的调度方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代制造系统需要在应对随机任务持续时间的同时满足严格的交付期限，传统确定性调度在现实偏离名义计划时会失效，导致昂贵的紧急维修。

Method: 首先构建柔性作业车间约束规划模型并插入最优缓冲区，然后将计划转换为简单不确定性时间网络并验证动态可控性，确保实时调度器能够重新安排活动时间而不违反约束。

Result: 在Kacem基准测试套件上的蒙特卡洛模拟显示，该方法消除了100%的截止期限违反，同时仅增加3-5%的制造周期开销，且可扩展性实验证实求解时间保持在亚秒级。

Conclusion: 该工作展示了时间网络推理如何弥合主动缓冲和动态鲁棒性之间的差距，推动行业向真正数字化、自校正工厂迈进。

Abstract: Modern manufacturing systems must meet hard delivery deadlines while coping
with stochastic task durations caused by process noise, equipment variability,
and human intervention. Traditional deterministic schedules break down when
reality deviates from nominal plans, triggering costly last-minute repairs.
This thesis combines offline constraint-programming (CP) optimisation with
online temporal-network execution to create schedules that remain feasible
under worst-case uncertainty. First, we build a CP model of the flexible
job-shop with per-job deadline tasks and insert an optimal buffer $\Delta^*$ to
obtain a fully pro-active baseline. We then translate the resulting plan into a
Simple Temporal Network with Uncertainty (STNU) and verify dynamic
controllability, which guarantees that a real-time dispatcher can retime
activities for every bounded duration realisation without violating resource or
deadline constraints. Extensive Monte-Carlo simulations on the open Kacem~1--4
benchmark suite show that our hybrid approach eliminates 100\% of deadline
violations observed in state-of-the-art meta-heuristic schedules, while adding
only 3--5\% makespan overhead. Scalability experiments confirm that CP
solve-times and STNU checks remain sub-second on medium-size instances. The
work demonstrates how temporal-network reasoning can bridge the gap between
proactive buffering and dynamic robustness, moving industry a step closer to
truly digital, self-correcting factories.

Motivation: 解决高质量临床思维链数据稀缺问题，验证LLM生成医疗数据的可靠性，并探索提升其质量的提示策略。

Method: 在辅助生殖技术领域进行盲法比较研究，资深临床医生评估三种策略生成的思维链：零样本、随机少样本和选择性少样本，并与GPT-4o的评估结果对比。

Result: 选择性少样本策略在所有人类评估指标上显著优于其他策略(p < .001)，随机少样本相比零样本无显著改进，AI评估器未能识别这些关键性能差异。

Conclusion: 合成思维链的临床可靠性取决于策略性提示优化而非示例数量，提出"双原则"框架作为生成可信数据的基础方法，确认人类专家在评估高风险临床AI中的不可或缺作用。

Abstract: Creating high-quality clinical Chains-of-Thought (CoTs) is crucial for
explainable medical Artificial Intelligence (AI) while constrained by data
scarcity. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) can synthesize medical data,
their clinical reliability remains unverified. This study evaluates the
reliability of LLM-generated CoTs and investigates prompting strategies to
enhance their quality. In a blinded comparative study, senior clinicians in
Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART) evaluated CoTs generated via three
distinct strategies: Zero-shot, Random Few-shot (using shallow examples), and
Selective Few-shot (using diverse, high-quality examples). These expert ratings
were compared against evaluations from a state-of-the-art AI model (GPT-4o).
The Selective Few-shot strategy significantly outperformed other strategies
across all human evaluation metrics (p < .001). Critically, the Random Few-shot
strategy offered no significant improvement over the Zero-shot baseline,
demonstrating that low-quality examples are as ineffective as no examples. The
success of the Selective strategy is attributed to two principles:
"Gold-Standard Depth" (reasoning quality) and "Representative Diversity"
(generalization). Notably, the AI evaluator failed to discern these critical
performance differences. The clinical reliability of synthetic CoTs is dictated
by strategic prompt curation, not the mere presence of examples. We propose a
"Dual Principles" framework as a foundational methodology to generate
trustworthy data at scale. This work offers a validated solution to the data
bottleneck and confirms the indispensable role of human expertise in evaluating
high-stakes clinical AI.

Conclusion: DTKG通过双轨方法有效解决了多跳推理中不同类型问题的挑战，为检索增强生成中的多跳问答提供了更优的解决方案

Abstract: Multi-hop reasoning for question answering (QA) plays a critical role in
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for modern large language models (LLMs).
The accurate answer can be obtained through retrieving relational structure of
entities from knowledge graph (KG). Regarding the inherent relation-dependency
and reasoning pattern, multi-hop reasoning can be in general classified into
two categories: i) parallel fact-verification multi-hop reasoning question,
i.e., requiring simultaneous verifications of multiple independent
sub-questions; and ii) chained multi-hop reasoning questions, i.e., demanding
sequential multi-step inference with intermediate conclusions serving as
essential premises for subsequent reasoning. Currently, the multi-hop reasoning
approaches singly employ one of two techniques: LLM response-based fact
verification and KG path-based chain construction. Nevertheless, the former
excels at parallel fact-verification but underperforms on chained reasoning
tasks, while the latter demonstrates proficiency in chained multi-hop reasoning
but suffers from redundant path retrieval when handling parallel
fact-verification reasoning. These limitations deteriorate the efficiency and
accuracy for multi-hop QA tasks. To address this challenge, we propose a novel
dual-track KG verification and reasoning framework DTKG, which is inspired by
the Dual Process Theory in cognitive science. Specifically, DTKG comprises two
main stages: the Classification Stage and the Branch Processing Stage.

Conclusion: 该研究为在算法时代创建可测量和可审判的审计证据提供了路径，使公司思维变得可追踪和可问责，解决了AI中介决策带来的公司责任认定挑战。

Abstract: Corporate responsibility turns on notions of corporate \textit{mens rea},
traditionally imputed from human agents. Yet these assumptions are under
challenge as generative AI increasingly mediates enterprise decision-making.
Building on the theory of extended cognition, we argue that in response
corporate knowledge may be redefined as a dynamic capability, measurable by the
efficiency of its information-access procedures and the validated reliability
of their outputs. We develop a formal model that captures epistemic states of
corporations deploying sophisticated AI or information systems, introducing a
continuous organisational knowledge metric $S_S(\varphi)$ which integrates a
pipeline's computational cost and its statistically validated error rate. We
derive a thresholded knowledge predicate $\mathsf{K}_S$ to impute knowledge and
a firm-wide epistemic capacity index $\mathcal{K}_{S,t}$ to measure overall
capability. We then operationally map these quantitative metrics onto the legal
standards of actual knowledge, constructive knowledge, wilful blindness, and
recklessness. Our work provides a pathway towards creating measurable and
justiciable audit artefacts, that render the corporate mind tractable and
accountable in the algorithmic age.

Motivation: PHI去标识化对于临床笔记的安全重用至关重要，但传统评估依赖成本高昂的小规模专家标注，限制了模型比较和选择。

Method: 部署多个评估智能体独立判断PHI提取正确性，通过LLM多数投票机制整合不同评估者观点，生成稳定可复现的排名。

Conclusion: TEAM-PHI通过结合独立评估智能体和LLM多数投票，为PHI去标识化提供了实用、安全且成本效益高的自动评估和最佳模型选择解决方案。

Abstract: Protected health information (PHI) de-identification is critical for enabling
the safe reuse of clinical notes, yet evaluating and comparing PHI
de-identification models typically depends on costly, small-scale expert
annotations. We present TEAM-PHI, a multi-agent evaluation and selection
framework that uses large language models (LLMs) to automatically measure
de-identification quality and select the best-performing model without heavy
reliance on gold labels. TEAM-PHI deploys multiple Evaluation Agents, each
independently judging the correctness of PHI extractions and outputting
structured metrics. Their results are then consolidated through an LLM-based
majority voting mechanism that integrates diverse evaluator perspectives into a
single, stable, and reproducible ranking. Experiments on a real-world clinical
note corpus demonstrate that TEAM-PHI produces consistent and accurate
rankings: despite variation across individual evaluators, LLM-based voting
reliably converges on the same top-performing systems. Further comparison with
ground-truth annotations and human evaluation confirms that the framework's
automated rankings closely match supervised evaluation. By combining
independent evaluation agents with LLM majority voting, TEAM-PHI offers a
practical, secure, and cost-effective solution for automatic evaluation and
best-model selection in PHI de-identification, even when ground-truth labels
are limited.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着人们越来越多依赖LLMs进行信息检索，这些模型将多个视角合成为单一权威性回答，可能放大偏见和遗漏效应，使信息权力集中在少数LLM供应商手中，威胁到数字存在有限群体的集体记忆。

Method: 提出"被记住权"概念框架，包括最小化AI驱动信息遗漏风险、确保公平对待权利，同时保证生成内容最大程度真实。

Result: 建立了应对LLMs信息集中化风险的理论框架，为保护数字弱势群体和防止集体记忆扭曲提供了概念基础。

Conclusion: "被记住权"是应对LLMs信息权力集中化的重要概念，需要在AI发展中平衡信息检索效率与公平性、真实性保障。

Abstract: Since the rapid expansion of large language models (LLMs), people have begun
to rely on them for information retrieval. While traditional search engines
display ranked lists of sources shaped by search engine optimization (SEO),
advertising, and personalization, LLMs typically provide a synthesized response
that feels singular and authoritative. While both approaches carry risks of
bias and omission, LLMs may amplify the effect by collapsing multiple
perspectives into one answer, reducing users ability or inclination to compare
alternatives. This concentrates power over information in a few LLM vendors
whose systems effectively shape what is remembered and what is overlooked. As a
result, certain narratives, individuals or groups, may be disproportionately
suppressed, while others are disproportionately elevated. Over time, this
creates a new threat: the gradual erasure of those with limited digital
presence, and the amplification of those already prominent, reshaping
collective memory.To address these concerns, this paper presents a concept of
the Right To Be Remembered (RTBR) which encompasses minimizing the risk of
AI-driven information omission, embracing the right of fair treatment, while
ensuring that the generated content would be maximally truthful.

Motivation: 临床医生需要实时工作并能解释选择理由的排序系统，需要一个低延迟、基于解码器的重排序器。

Method: 采用单解码器方法，结合池化首令牌评分信号和不确定性门控解释步骤，通过课程学习专注于困难案例。

Result: 在遭遇范围订单选择任务中表现优异（快速路径：Recall@1~0.45，nDCG@20~0.625），门控激活时效果进一步提升（Recall@1~0.56，nDCG@20~0.699，门控率45%）。

Conclusion: OG-Rank提供了一个实用方案：默认快速排序，在需要时解释，这种模式适用于选择性生成能以可接受成本提高准确性的决策任务。

Abstract: Clinicians need ranking systems that work in real time and still justify
their choices. Motivated by the need for a low-latency, decoder-based reranker,
we present OG-Rank, a single-decoder approach that pairs a pooled first-token
scoring signal with an uncertainty-gated explanation step. The model scores all
candidates in one pass and generates a brief, structured rationale only when
the list is genuinely ambiguous, keeping latency predictable. Trained with a
curriculum that concentrates effort on hard cases, OG-Rank delivers strong
effectiveness on encounter-scoped order selection (fast path: Recall@1~0.45,
nDCG@20~0.625) and improves further when the gate activates (Recall@1~0.56,
nDCG@20~0.699 at a 45\% gate rate), while compact backbones show similar gains
under the same policy. Encoder baselines trail in both effectiveness and
flexibility. The result is a practical recipe: rank fast by default and explain
when it helps, a pattern that applies broadly to decision tasks where selective
generation buys accuracy at acceptable cost. The single-policy design
simplifies deployment and budget planning, and the curriculum principle (spend
more on the hard cases, less on the easy ones) readily transfers beyond
clinical order selection.

Abstract: As AI tools become increasingly common for research ideation, robust
evaluation is critical to ensure the validity and usefulness of generated
ideas. We introduce ScholarEval, a retrieval augmented evaluation framework
that assesses research ideas based on two fundamental criteria: soundness - the
empirical validity of proposed methods based on existing literature, and
contribution - the degree of advancement made by the idea across different
dimensions relative to prior research. To evaluate ScholarEval, we introduce
ScholarIdeas, the first expert-annotated dataset of multi-domain research ideas
and reviews, comprised of 117 ideas across four disciplines: artificial
intelligence, neuroscience, biochemistry, and ecology. Our evaluation shows
that ScholarEval achieves significantly higher coverage of points mentioned in
the human expert annotated rubrics in ScholarIdeas compared to all baselines.
Furthermore, ScholarEval is consistently preferred over our strongest baseline
o4-mini-deep-research, a reasoning and search-enabled agentic system by OpenAI,
in terms of evaluation actionability, depth, and evidence support. Our

### [463] [Distractor Injection Attacks on Large Reasoning Models: Characterization and Defense](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16259)
*Zhehao Zhang,Weijie Xu,Shixian Cui,Chandan K. Reddy*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文识别并系统分析了大型推理模型(LRMs)中存在的"推理分心"漏洞，即模型被恶意嵌入提示中的无关复杂任务所干扰。研究表明最先进的LRMs高度易受攻击，注入干扰物可使任务准确率下降高达60%。作者提出基于SFT和RL的训练防御方法，可将鲁棒性提高50多个点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大型推理模型在数学和编程等复杂任务上取得显著进展，作者发现这些模型存在一个关键漏洞——容易被提示中嵌入的无关复杂任务所干扰，从而偏离主要目标。这种"推理分心"威胁到LRM的可靠性，需要系统研究和防御。

Method: 通过跨多种模型和基准的综合研究，分析LRM对推理分心的敏感性。提出基于监督微调(SFT)和强化学习(RL)的训练防御方法，使用合成的对抗数据进行训练以提高模型鲁棒性。

Result: 研究表明最先进的LRMs高度易受推理分心攻击，注入的干扰物可使任务准确率下降高达60%。某些对齐技术会放大这种弱点，模型可能表现出隐蔽服从行为。提出的防御方法在具有挑战性的干扰攻击上将鲁棒性提高了50多个点。

Conclusion: 推理分心是对LRM可靠性的独特且紧迫的威胁。研究结果为构建更安全、更可信的推理系统提供了实用步骤，强调了需要针对此类攻击开发专门的防御机制。

Abstract: Recent advances in large reasoning models (LRMs) have enabled remarkable
performance on complex tasks such as mathematics and coding by generating long
Chain-of-Thought (CoT) traces. In this paper, we identify and systematically
analyze a critical vulnerability we term reasoning distraction, where LRMs are
diverted from their primary objective by irrelevant yet complex tasks
maliciously embedded in the prompt. Through a comprehensive study across
diverse models and benchmarks, we show that even state-of-the-art LRMs are
highly susceptible, with injected distractors reducing task accuracy by up to
60%. We further reveal that certain alignment techniques can amplify this
weakness and that models may exhibit covert compliance, following hidden
adversarial instructions in reasoning while concealing them in the final
output. To mitigate these risks, we propose a training-based defense that
combines Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) on
synthetic adversarial data, improving robustness by over 50 points on
challenging distractor attacks. Our findings establish reasoning distraction as
a distinct and urgent threat to LRM reliability and provide a practical step
toward safer and more trustworthy reasoning systems.

*Song Bian,Minghao Yan,Anand Jayarajan,Gennady Pekhimenko,Shivaram Venkataraman*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文通过实证研究发现基于网络交互的智能体系统存在效率瓶颈，提出SpecCache缓存框架来减少网络环境延迟，显著提升系统效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注智能体系统的推理性能，但忽视了系统效率问题，特别是网络交互带来的延迟瓶颈。

Method: 将端到端延迟分解为LLM API延迟和网络环境延迟，提出SpecCache缓存框架结合推测执行来优化网络环境开销。

Result: 网络环境延迟可占整体延迟的53.7%，SpecCache相比随机缓存策略提升命中率58倍，减少网络环境开销3.2倍，且不影响系统性能。

Conclusion: SpecCache能有效解决网络交互智能体系统的效率瓶颈，在不牺牲性能的前提下显著降低延迟。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs), such as OpenAI-o1 and DeepSeek-R1, have
demonstrated strong reasoning capabilities. To further enhance LLM
capabilities, recent agentic systems, such as Deep Research, incorporate web
interactions into LLM reasoning to mitigate uncertainties and reduce potential
errors. However, existing research predominantly focuses on reasoning
performance, often neglecting the efficiency of agentic systems. In this work,
we present a comprehensive empirical study that identifies efficiency
bottlenecks in web-interactive agentic systems. We decompose end-to-end latency
into two primary components: LLM API latency and web environment latency. We
conduct a comprehensive empirical study across 15 models and 5 providers to
demonstrate high variability in API-based agentic systems. We observe that web
environment latency can contribute as much as 53.7% to the overall latency in a
web-based agentic system. To improve latency, we propose SpecCache, a caching
framework augmented with speculative execution that can reduce web environment
overhead. Extensive evaluations on two standard benchmarks show that our
approach improves the cache hit rate by up to 58x compared to a random caching
strategy, while reducing web environment overhead by up to 3.2x, without
degrading agentic system performance.

*Crystal Su*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MedRule-KG是一个紧凑型知识图谱与符号验证器的结合，旨在在推理任务中强制执行数学可解释规则，显著提升大型语言模型的推理准确性和一致性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型经常产生流畅的推理步骤，但违反简单的数学或逻辑约束，需要一种方法来确保推理的数学一致性。

Method: 引入MedRule-KG，一个紧凑的类型化知识图谱，结合符号验证器，编码实体、关系和三个领域启发规则，验证预测并应用最小修正保证一致性。

Result: 在90个FDA衍生基准测试中，基于MedRule-KG的推理将精确匹配从0.767提升到0.900，添加验证器后达到1.000精确匹配，完全消除规则违反。

Conclusion: MedRule-KG为安全数学推理提供了一个通用框架，通过知识图谱和符号验证的结合有效解决了LLMs的推理一致性问题。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) often produce fluent reasoning steps while
violating simple mathematical or logical constraints. We introduce MedRule-KG,
a compact typed knowledge graph coupled with a symbolic verifier, designed to
enforce mathematically interpretable rules in reasoning tasks. MedRule-KG
encodes entities, relations, and three domain-inspired rules, while the
verifier checks predictions and applies minimal corrections to guarantee
consistency. On a 90-example FDA-derived benchmark, grounding in MedRule-KG
improves exact match (EM) from 0.767 to 0.900, and adding the verifier yields
1.000 EM while eliminating rule violations entirely. We demonstrate how
MedRule-KG provides a general scaffold for safe mathematical reasoning, discuss
ablations, and release code and data to encourage reproducibility.

*Tong Zhang,Ru Zhang,Jianyi Liu,Zhen Yang,Gongshen Liu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SELECT是一个动态锚点选择框架，通过两阶段评估机制自动发现最优锚点进行精确概念擦除，同时识别关键边界锚点以保留相关概念，解决了固定锚点策略导致的概念重现和侵蚀问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本到图像扩散模型的概念擦除方法依赖固定锚点策略，常导致概念重现和侵蚀等关键问题。通过因果追踪发现擦除对锚点选择具有内在敏感性，需要更优的锚点选择方法。

Method: 提出SELECT框架，采用新颖的两阶段评估机制：自动发现最优擦除锚点，同时识别关键边界锚点以保护相关概念。基于因果追踪定义了兄弟排他概念作为更优锚点类别。

Result: 广泛评估表明SELECT作为通用锚点解决方案，不仅能高效适应多种擦除框架，还在关键性能指标上持续优于现有基线，单个概念锚点挖掘平均仅需4秒。

Conclusion: SELECT通过动态锚点选择有效解决了固定锚点策略的局限性，提供了更精确和高效的概念擦除方案。

Abstract: Existing concept erasure methods for text-to-image diffusion models commonly
rely on fixed anchor strategies, which often lead to critical issues such as
concept re-emergence and erosion. To address this, we conduct causal tracing to
reveal the inherent sensitivity of erasure to anchor selection and define
Sibling Exclusive Concepts as a superior class of anchors. Based on this
insight, we propose \textbf{SELECT} (Sibling-Exclusive Evaluation for
Contextual Targeting), a dynamic anchor selection framework designed to
overcome the limitations of fixed anchors. Our framework introduces a novel
two-stage evaluation mechanism that automatically discovers optimal anchors for
precise erasure while identifying critical boundary anchors to preserve related
concepts. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that SELECT, as a universal anchor
solution, not only efficiently adapts to multiple erasure frameworks but also
consistently outperforms existing baselines across key performance metrics,
averaging only 4 seconds for anchor mining of a single concept.

### [467] [The Burden of Interactive Alignment with Inconsistent Preferences](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16368)
*Ali Shirali*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文研究用户如何通过策略性互动来引导算法与真实兴趣对齐。用户存在理性系统2（决定是否参与）和冲动系统1（决定参与时长）的偏好不一致问题。研究发现存在关键时间范围：足够有远见的用户能实现对齐，否则会被算法目标同化。额外的小信号（如额外点击）能显著降低对齐负担。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 算法与用户互动中，用户经常表现出不一致的偏好（花费时间在低价值内容上），这导致算法无法准确学习用户的真实兴趣。研究旨在探索用户需要什么条件才能有效引导算法与其真实兴趣对齐。

Method: 将用户决策过程建模为理性系统2（决定是否参与）和冲动系统1（决定参与时长）的分离。采用多领导者-单追随者的扩展Stackelberg博弈模型，用户（系统2）通过承诺参与策略来引导，算法基于观察到的互动进行最佳响应。

Result: 发现存在关键时间范围：足够有远见的用户能实现算法对齐，而缺乏远见的用户会被算法目标同化。这个关键范围可能很长，带来显著负担，但即使小的成本信号（如额外点击）也能显著降低对齐负担。

Conclusion: 该框架解释了偏好不一致的用户如何在Stackelberg均衡中引导参与驱动型算法与其兴趣对齐，揭示了实现对齐的挑战和潜在补救措施。

Abstract: From media platforms to chatbots, algorithms shape how people interact,
learn, and discover information. Such interactions between users and an
algorithm often unfold over multiple steps, during which strategic users can
guide the algorithm to better align with their true interests by selectively
engaging with content. However, users frequently exhibit inconsistent
preferences: they may spend considerable time on content that offers little
long-term value, inadvertently signaling that such content is desirable.
Focusing on the user side, this raises a key question: what does it take for
such users to align the algorithm with their true interests?
  To investigate these dynamics, we model the user's decision process as split
between a rational system 2 that decides whether to engage and an impulsive
system 1 that determines how long engagement lasts. We then study a
multi-leader, single-follower extensive Stackelberg game, where users,
specifically system 2, lead by committing to engagement strategies and the
algorithm best-responds based on observed interactions. We define the burden of
alignment as the minimum horizon over which users must optimize to effectively
steer the algorithm. We show that a critical horizon exists: users who are
sufficiently foresighted can achieve alignment, while those who are not are
instead aligned to the algorithm's objective. This critical horizon can be
long, imposing a substantial burden. However, even a small, costly signal
(e.g., an extra click) can significantly reduce it. Overall, our framework
explains how users with inconsistent preferences can align an engagement-driven
algorithm with their interests in a Stackelberg equilibrium, highlighting both
the challenges and potential remedies for achieving alignment.

### [468] [Before you <think>, monitor: Implementing Flavell's metacognitive framework in LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16374)
*Nick Oh*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种结合监控-生成-验证的三阶段迭代系统，在GSM8K数学推理任务上取得了75.42%的准确率，优于现有方法且需要更少的尝试次数。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的LLM推理增强方法存在两个孤立范式：监控-生成方法擅长策略规划但缺乏验证机制，生成-验证方法能迭代优化但缺乏任务评估。这种分离导致策略失败无反馈、优化无策略基础的低效问题。

Method: 基于Flavell的认知监控模型，实现监控-生成-验证框架的三阶段迭代系统，在生成前进行任务评估和策略规划。

Result: 在GSM8K上达到75.42%准确率，优于SELF-REFINE(68.44%)和Self-Verification(67.07%)，仅需1.3次尝试(对比2.0次)，推理成本增加27-37%。

Conclusion: 前期监控能产生更高质量的初始解决方案，减少优化需求，但需要在算术推理之外的任务上进行评估以验证通用性。

Abstract: Current approaches to enhancing LLM reasoning follows two isolated paradigms:
Monitor-Generate methods like Plan-and-Solve (Wang et al., 2023) and
SELF-DISCOVER (Zhou et al., 2024) excel at strategic planning but lack
mechanisms to verify whether selected strategies succeed; while Generate-Verify
approaches like Self-Verification (Weng et al., 2022) and SELF-REFINE (Madaan
et al., 2023) iteratively refine outputs but commence generation blindly
without task assessment. This separation creates inefficiencies -- strategies
fail without feedback, and refinement occurs without strategic grounding. We
address this gap by implementing Flavell's cognitive monitoring model (1979)
from the broader Monitor-Generate-Verify framework (Oh and Gobet, 2025),
operationalising it as a three-phase iterative system. On GSM8K, preliminary
results show 75.42% accuracy versus 68.44% for SELF-REFINE and 67.07% for
Self-Verification, while requiring fewer attempts (1.3 vs 2.0) at 27-37%
increased inference cost. These initial findings suggest upfront monitoring
produces higher-quality initial solutions that reduce refinement needs, though
evaluation beyond arithmetic reasoning is needed to establish generalisability.

TL;DR: 提出HSCM因果框架，模仿人类智能的层次处理和多级学习机制，通过解耦和重加权图像属性来提升跨领域泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 克服传统领域泛化模型的局限性，这些模型依赖统计方法捕捉数据-标签依赖关系，而HSCM旨在模拟人类视觉系统的因果机制处理方式。

Method: 基于人类智能启发的结构因果模型，解耦和重加权关键图像属性（颜色、纹理、形状），建模细粒度因果机制。

Result: 理论和实证评估表明，HSCM在领域泛化任务中优于现有模型，提供更稳健的性能和可解释性。

Conclusion: HSCM为捕捉因果关系和提升模型鲁棒性提供了更原则性的方法，在动态复杂环境中实现更有效的迁移学习。

Abstract: This paper proposes the Humanoid-inspired Structural Causal Model (HSCM), a
novel causal framework inspired by human intelligence, designed to overcome the
limitations of conventional domain generalization models. Unlike approaches
that rely on statistics to capture data-label dependencies and learn
distortion-invariant representations, HSCM replicates the hierarchical
processing and multi-level learning of human vision systems, focusing on
modeling fine-grained causal mechanisms. By disentangling and reweighting key
image attributes such as color, texture, and shape, HSCM enhances
generalization across diverse domains, ensuring robust performance and
interpretability. Leveraging the flexibility and adaptability of human
intelligence, our approach enables more effective transfer and learning in
dynamic, complex environments. Through both theoretical and empirical
evaluations, we demonstrate that HSCM outperforms existing domain
generalization models, providing a more principled method for capturing causal
relationships and improving model robustness. The code is available at

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出RGMem框架，通过多尺度记忆组织实现语言代理的长期记忆和行为一致性，解决现有方法在用户建模深度和跨会话连续性方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于LLM的对话系统受限于有限上下文窗口和静态参数记忆，难以建模跨会话的长期用户状态和行为一致性。RAG和显式记忆系统主要关注事实级存储和检索，缺乏从多轮对话中提取潜在偏好和深层特征的能力。

Method: 受物理学重正化群思想启发，提出RGMem自演化记忆框架。该框架在多尺度组织对话历史：首先从片段中提取语义和用户洞察，然后通过分层粗粒化和重标度操作，逐步形成动态演化的用户画像。

Result: 通过将记忆演化建模为信息压缩和涌现的多尺度过程，能够从噪声和微观级交互中实现高级且准确的用户画像。

Conclusion: RGMem框架为实现语言代理的长期记忆和行为一致性提供了有效解决方案，通过多尺度记忆组织提升了用户建模的深度和跨会话连续性。

Abstract: Personalized and continuous interactions are the key to enhancing user
experience in today's large language model (LLM)-based conversational systems,
however, the finite context windows and static parametric memory make it
difficult to model the cross-session long-term user states and behavioral
consistency. Currently, the existing solutions to this predicament, such as
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and explicit memory systems, primarily
focus on fact-level storage and retrieval, lacking the capability to distill
latent preferences and deep traits from the multi-turn dialogues, which limits
the long-term and effective user modeling, directly leading to the personalized
interactions remaining shallow, and hindering the cross-session continuity. To
realize the long-term memory and behavioral consistency for Language Agents in
LLM era, we propose a self-evolving memory framework RGMem, inspired by the
ideology of classic renormalization group (RG) in physics, this framework
enables to organize the dialogue history in multiple scales: it first extracts
semantics and user insights from episodic fragments, then through hierarchical
coarse-graining and rescaling operations, progressively forms a
dynamically-evolved user profile. The core innovation of our work lies in
modeling memory evolution as a multi-scale process of information compression
and emergence, which accomplishes the high-level and accurate user profiles
from noisy and microscopic-level interactions.

TL;DR: ReviewSense是一个新颖的规范性决策支持框架，利用先进的大型语言模型将客户评论转化为有针对性的、可操作的商业建议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统AI系统擅长预测用户偏好，但很少关注将客户评论转化为面向业务的规范性建议。客户反馈对战略增长至关重要，需要从未结构化评论中获取可操作的见解。

Method: 集成聚类、LLM适应和专家驱动评估的统一业务导向流程，识别关键趋势、重复问题和客户情绪中的具体关注点。

Result: 初步人工评估显示模型建议与商业目标高度一致，突显其在推动数据驱动决策方面的潜力。

Conclusion: 该框架为AI驱动的情感分析提供了新视角，展示了其在完善商业战略和最大化客户反馈影响方面的价值。

Abstract: As customer feedback becomes increasingly central to strategic growth, the
ability to derive actionable insights from unstructured reviews is essential.
While traditional AI-driven systems excel at predicting user preferences, far
less work has focused on transforming customer reviews into prescriptive,
business-facing recommendations. This paper introduces ReviewSense, a novel
prescriptive decision support framework that leverages advanced large language
models (LLMs) to transform customer reviews into targeted, actionable business
recommendations. By identifying key trends, recurring issues, and specific
concerns within customer sentiments, ReviewSense extends beyond
preference-based systems to provide businesses with deeper insights for
sustaining growth and enhancing customer loyalty. The novelty of this work lies
in integrating clustering, LLM adaptation, and expert-driven evaluation into a
unified, business-facing pipeline. Preliminary manual evaluations indicate
strong alignment between the model's recommendations and business objectives,
highlighting its potential for driving data-informed decision-making. This
framework offers a new perspective on AI-driven sentiment analysis,
demonstrating its value in refining business strategies and maximizing the
impact of customer feedback.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管LLMs在数学、编程等推理任务上表现出色，但在NP难优化问题上的能力尚未充分探索，需要专门框架来训练和评估。

Method: 开发NP-ENGINE框架，包含可控实例生成器、规则验证器和启发式求解器，支持可扩展的RLVR训练。使用零RLVR和课程学习训练QWEN2.5-7B-NP模型。

Result: QWEN2.5-7B-NP在NP-BENCH基准上显著优于GPT-4o，达到同规模模型SOTA性能。RLVR训练还带来强大的跨领域泛化能力，包括推理和非推理任务。

Conclusion: 任务丰富的RLVR训练是提升LLM推理能力的有前景方向，揭示了RLVR的扩展规律。增加任务多样性可改善跨领域泛化能力。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown strong reasoning capabilities, with
models like OpenAI's O-series and DeepSeek R1 excelling at tasks such as
mathematics, coding, logic, and puzzles through Reinforcement Learning with
Verifiable Rewards (RLVR). However, their ability to solve more complex
optimization problems - particularly NP-hard tasks - remains underexplored. To
bridge this gap, we propose NP-ENGINE, the first comprehensive framework for
training and evaluating LLMs on NP-hard problems. NP-ENGINE covers 10 tasks
across five domains, each equipped with (i) a controllable instance generator,
(ii) a rule-based verifier, and (iii) a heuristic solver that provides
approximate optimal solutions as ground truth. This
generator-verifier-heuristic pipeline enables scalable and verifiable RLVR
training under hierarchical difficulties. We also introduce NP-BENCH, a
benchmark derived from NP-ENGINE-DATA, specifically designed to evaluate LLMs'
ability to tackle NP-hard level reasoning problems, focusing not only on
feasibility but also on solution quality. Additionally, we present
QWEN2.5-7B-NP, a model trained via zero-RLVR with curriculum learning on
Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct, which significantly outperforms GPT-4o on NP-BENCH and
achieves SOTA performance with the same model size. Beyond in-domain tasks, we
demonstrate that RLVR training on NP-ENGINE-DATA enables strong out-of-domain
(OOD) generalization to reasoning tasks (logic, puzzles, math, and knowledge),
as well as non-reasoning tasks such as instruction following. We also observe a
scaling trend: increasing task diversity improves OOD generalization. These
findings suggest that task-rich RLVR training is a promising direction for
advancing LLM's reasoning ability, revealing new insights into the scaling laws
of RLVR.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: MIRAGE是一个推理时的多模态虚假信息检测框架，通过分解验证过程为四个模块：视觉真实性评估、跨模态一致性分析、检索增强的事实核查和校准判断，无需领域特定训练数据即可达到监督检测器的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 网络平台上每天有数十亿包含文本和图像的多模态帖子传播虚假信息，人工事实核查能力不足。现有监督检测模型需要领域特定训练数据，且无法泛化到不同的操纵策略。

Method: MIRAGE框架将多模态验证分解为四个顺序模块：检测AI生成图像、识别跨模态不一致、通过迭代问题生成进行检索增强的事实核查、以及整合所有信号的校准判断模块。

Result: 在MMFakeBench验证集上，MIRAGE与GPT-4o-mini组合达到81.65% F1和75.1%准确率，比最强的零样本基线提升7.65 F1点，同时将误报率从97.3%降至34.3%。测试集结果确认了泛化能力。

Conclusion: 分解的智能推理与网络检索相结合，可以在没有领域特定训练的情况下匹配监督检测器的性能，为标记数据稀缺的多模态虚假信息检测提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Misinformation spreads across web platforms through billions of daily
multimodal posts that combine text and images, overwhelming manual
fact-checking capacity. Supervised detection models require domain-specific
training data and fail to generalize across diverse manipulation tactics. We
present MIRAGE, an inference-time, model-pluggable agentic framework that
decomposes multimodal verification into four sequential modules: visual
veracity assessment detects AI-generated images, cross-modal consistency
analysis identifies out-of-context repurposing, retrieval-augmented factual
checking grounds claims in web evidence through iterative question generation,
and a calibrated judgment module integrates all signals. MIRAGE orchestrates
vision-language model reasoning with targeted web retrieval, outputs structured
and citation-linked rationales. On MMFakeBench validation set (1,000 samples),
MIRAGE with GPT-4o-mini achieves 81.65% F1 and 75.1% accuracy, outperforming
the strongest zero-shot baseline (GPT-4V with MMD-Agent at 74.0% F1) by 7.65
points while maintaining 34.3% false positive rate versus 97.3% for a
judge-only baseline. Test set results (5,000 samples) confirm generalization
with 81.44% F1 and 75.08% accuracy. Ablation studies show visual verification
contributes 5.18 F1 points and retrieval-augmented reasoning contributes 2.97
points. Our results demonstrate that decomposed agentic reasoning with web
retrieval can match supervised detector performance without domain-specific
training, enabling misinformation detection across modalities where labeled
data remains scarce.

Motivation: 希望描述一种遵循人类技能获取速度的技能行为学习形式，比现有方法更高效，更接近模拟人脑中的心理表征及其实际学习过程。

Method: 将轻量线性函数式编程语言编码到向量符号架构中，类型使用基于全息声明性内存的槽值编码方案，术语使用Lisp VSA变体编码。

Result: Doug允许神经网络嵌入空间中的某些点被解释为类型，附近点的类型在结构和内容上都相似，因此类型可由神经网络学习。

Conclusion: 该方法使我们更接近模拟人脑中实际存在的心理表征及其实际学习过程，为技能获取提供了一种比现有方法更高效的解决方案。

Abstract: We present a typed computer language, Doug, in which all typed programs may
be proved to halt in polynomial time, encoded in a vector-symbolic architecture
(VSA). Doug is just an encoding of the light linear functional programming
language (LLFPL) described by (Schimanski2009, ch. 7). The types of Doug are
encoded using a slot-value encoding scheme based on holographic declarative
memory (HDM; Kelly, 2020). The terms of Doug are encoded using a variant of the
Lisp VSA defined by (Flanagan, 2024). Doug allows for some points on the
embedding space of a neural network to be interpreted as types, where the types
of nearby points are similar both in structure and content. Types in Doug are
therefore learnable by a neural network. Following (Chollet, 2019), (Card,
1983), and (Newell, 1981), we view skill as the application of a procedure, or
program of action, that causes a goal to be satisfied. Skill acquisition may
therefore be expressed as program synthesis. Using Doug, we hope to describe a
form of learning of skilled behaviour that follows a human-like pace of skill
acquisition (i.e., substantially faster than brute force; Heathcote, 2000),
exceeding the efficiency of all currently existing approaches (Kaplan, 2020;
Jones, 2021; Chollet, 2024). Our approach brings us one step closer to modeling
human mental representations, as they must actually exist in the brain, and
those representations' acquisition, as they are actually learned.

urban environments. Recent studies have built urban foundation models using
supervised fine-tuning (SFT) of LLMs and MLLMs, yet these models exhibit
persistent geospatial bias, producing regionally skewed predictions and limited
generalization. To this end, we propose Urban-R1, a reinforcement
learning-based post-training framework that aligns MLLMs with the objectives of
UGI. Urban-R1 adopts Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to optimize
reasoning across geographic groups and employs urban region profiling as a
proxy task to provide measurable rewards from multimodal urban data. Extensive
experiments across diverse regions and tasks show that Urban-R1 effectively
mitigates geo-bias and improves cross-region generalization, outperforming both
SFT-trained and closed-source models. Our results highlight reinforcement
learning alignment as a promising pathway toward equitable and trustworthy
urban intelligence.

*Tian Xia,Tianrun Gao,Wenhao Deng,Long Wei,Xiaowei Qian,Yixian Jiang,Chenglei Yu,Tailin Wu*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: BuildArena是第一个物理对齐的交互式基准测试，用于评估语言驱动的工程建筑自动化能力，包含可定制框架、可扩展任务设计、3D空间几何计算库和基线LLM智能工作流。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工程建筑自动化需要将自然语言规范转化为物理可行的结构，但现代LLM在此领域的建筑能力尚未得到充分评估。

Method: 开发了BuildArena基准测试，包含四个核心组件：可定制基准框架、可扩展任务设计策略、3D空间几何计算库和基线LLM智能工作流。

Result: 在八个前沿LLM上全面评估了它们在语言驱动和物理基础建筑自动化方面的能力。

Conclusion: BuildArena填补了语言驱动工程建筑自动化评估的空白，为社区提供了全面的基准测试工具。

Abstract: Engineering construction automation aims to transform natural language
specifications into physically viable structures, requiring complex integrated
reasoning under strict physical constraints. While modern LLMs possess broad
knowledge and strong reasoning capabilities that make them promising candidates
for this domain, their construction competencies remain largely unevaluated. To
address this gap, we introduce BuildArena, the first physics-aligned
interactive benchmark designed for language-driven engineering construction. It
contributes to the community in four aspects: (1) a highly customizable
benchmarking framework for in-depth comparison and analysis of LLMs; (2) an
extendable task design strategy spanning static and dynamic mechanics across
multiple difficulty tiers; (3) a 3D Spatial Geometric Computation Library for
supporting construction based on language instructions; (4) a baseline LLM
agentic workflow that effectively evaluates diverse model capabilities. On
eight frontier LLMs, BuildArena comprehensively evaluates their capabilities
for language-driven and physics-grounded construction automation. The project

*Ayush Chopra,Aman Sharma,Feroz Ahmad,Luca Muscariello,Vijoy Pandey,Ramesh Raskar*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了Ripple Effect Protocol (REP)协调协议，让AI代理不仅共享决策，还共享轻量级敏感度信号，从而在群体中实现更快更稳定的协调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI代理通信协议如A2A和ACP侧重于通信而非协调，随着代理群体规模扩大，这会导致脆弱的集体行为，即使单个代理很智能，群体结果也很差。

Method: 引入REP协议，代理共享决策和轻量级敏感度信号（表达关键环境变量变化时选择如何改变），这些敏感度在局部网络中传播。形式化REP协议规范，分离必需的消息模式与可选的聚合规则。

Result: 在三个领域的基准测试中：供应链级联（啤酒游戏）、稀疏网络中的偏好聚合（电影排期）、可持续资源分配（Fishbanks），REP相比A2A将协调准确性和效率提高了41%到100%，并能灵活处理来自LLM的多模态敏感度信号。

Conclusion: 通过将协调作为协议级能力，REP为新兴的代理互联网提供了可扩展的基础设施。

Abstract: Modern AI agents can exchange messages using protocols such as A2A and ACP,
yet these mechanisms emphasize communication over coordination. As agent
populations grow, this limitation produces brittle collective behavior, where
individually smart agents converge on poor group outcomes. We introduce the
Ripple Effect Protocol (REP), a coordination protocol in which agents share not
only their decisions but also lightweight sensitivities - signals expressing
how their choices would change if key environmental variables shifted. These
sensitivities ripple through local networks, enabling groups to align faster
and more stably than with agent-centric communication alone. We formalize REP's
protocol specification, separating required message schemas from optional
aggregation rules, and evaluate it across scenarios with varying incentives and
network topologies. Benchmarks across three domains: (i) supply chain cascades
(Beer Game), (ii) preference aggregation in sparse networks (Movie Scheduling),
and (iii) sustainable resource allocation (Fishbanks) show that REP improves
coordination accuracy and efficiency over A2A by 41 to 100%, while flexibly
handling multimodal sensitivity signals from LLMs. By making coordination a
protocol-level capability, REP provides scalable infrastructure for the
emerging Internet of Agents

TL;DR: GraphFlow是一个基于知识图谱的检索增强生成框架，通过流匹配目标优化检索策略和流估计器，有效从文本丰富的知识图谱中检索准确多样的知识。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的基于知识图谱的检索增强生成方法难以从文本丰富的知识图谱中为复杂真实世界查询检索准确和多样化的信息，而过程奖励模型又依赖昂贵且难以获取的过程级监督信号。

Method: 使用基于转移的流匹配目标联合优化检索策略和流估计器，流估计器将检索结果的奖励分解到中间检索状态，指导检索策略按奖励比例从知识图谱中检索候选结果。

Result: 在STaRK基准测试中，GraphFlow在命中率和召回率上平均比包括GPT-4o在内的强基线方法高出10%，并且在未见过的知识图谱上表现出强大的泛化能力。

Conclusion: GraphFlow能够有效从文本丰富的知识图谱中检索准确和多样化的知识，在真实世界查询中表现出优异的性能和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) based on knowledge graphs (KGs) enhances
large language models (LLMs) by providing structured and interpretable external
knowledge. However, existing KG-based RAG methods struggle to retrieve accurate
and diverse information from text-rich KGs for complex real-world queries.
Process Reward Models (PRMs) offer a way to align the retrieval process of
KG-based RAG with query-specific knowledge requirements, but they heavily rely
on process-level supervision signals that are expensive and hard to obtain on
KGs. To address this challenge, we propose GraphFlow, a framework that
efficiently retrieves accurate and diverse knowledge required for real-world
queries from text-rich KGs. GraphFlow employs a transition-based flow matching
objective to jointly optimize a retrieval policy and a flow estimator. The flow
estimator factorizes the reward of the retrieval outcome into the intermediate
retrieval states. Such reward factorization guides the retrieval policy to
retrieve candidates from KGs in proportion to their reward. This allows
GraphFlow to explore high-quality regions of KGs that yield diverse and
relevant results. We evaluate GraphFlow on the STaRK benchmark, which includes
real-world queries from multiple domains over text-rich KGs. GraphFlow
outperforms strong KG-RAG baselines, including GPT-4o, by 10% on average in hit
rate and recall. It also shows strong generalization to unseen KGs,
demonstrating its effectiveness and robustness.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种半监督置信分布学习方法（ssCDL）来解决不确定知识图谱补全中的置信度分布不平衡问题，通过将置信度转换为分布并利用元学习生成伪标签来增强训练数据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界中的不确定知识图谱存在不完整性，当前的研究方法忽略了置信度的极端不平衡分布，导致学习到的嵌入不足以支持高质量的知识图谱补全。

Method: 将每个三元组置信度转换为置信度分布，引入更多监督信息；通过关系学习在带标签数据（现有三元组）和无标签数据（带伪标签的未见三元组）上迭代学习嵌入；使用元学习预测置信度来增强训练数据并重新平衡置信度分布。

Result: 在两个不确定知识图谱数据集上的实验表明，ssCDL在不同评估指标上始终优于最先进的基线方法。

Conclusion: ssCDL方法通过处理置信度分布不平衡问题，有效提升了不确定知识图谱补全的性能。

Abstract: Uncertain knowledge graphs (UKGs) associate each triple with a confidence
score to provide more precise knowledge representations. Recently, since
real-world UKGs suffer from the incompleteness, uncertain knowledge graph (UKG)
completion attracts more attention, aiming to complete missing triples and
confidences. Current studies attempt to learn UKG embeddings to solve this
problem, but they neglect the extremely imbalanced distributions of triple
confidences. This causes that the learnt embeddings are insufficient to
high-quality UKG completion. Thus, in this paper, to address the above issue,
we propose a new semi-supervised Confidence Distribution Learning (ssCDL)
method for UKG completion, where each triple confidence is transformed into a
confidence distribution to introduce more supervision information of different
confidences to reinforce the embedding learning process. ssCDL iteratively
learns UKG embedding by relational learning on labeled data (i.e., existing
triples with confidences) and unlabeled data with pseudo labels (i.e., unseen
triples with the generated confidences), which are predicted by meta-learning
to augment the training data and rebalance the distribution of triple
confidences. Experiments on two UKG datasets demonstrate that ssCDL
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in different evaluation
metrics.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的RL范式依赖稀疏的结果奖励和有限的探索，导致LLM倾向于重复和次优的推理模式，需要设计更好的探索机制来提升推理能力。

Method: 提出MERCI算法，使用轻量级的Coin Flipping Network估计伪计数和认知不确定性，将其转换为内在奖励，并与GRPO等先进RL框架集成。

Result: 在复杂推理基准测试中，MERCI鼓励更丰富多样的思维链，显著超越强基线性能，帮助策略逃离局部最优并发现更好的解决方案。

Conclusion: 针对性的内在动机可以使语言模型推理的探索更加可靠有效。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has become a compelling way to strengthen the
multi step reasoning ability of Large Language Models (LLMs). However,
prevalent RL paradigms still lean on sparse outcome-based rewards and limited
exploration, which often drives LLMs toward repetitive and suboptimal reasoning
patterns. In this paper, we study the central question of how to design
exploration for LLM reasoning and introduce MERCI (Motivating Exploration in
LLM Reasoning with Count-based Intrinsic Rewards), a novel RL algorithm that
augments policy optimization with a principled intrinsic reward. Building on
the idea of count-based exploration, MERCI leverages a lightweight Coin
Flipping Network (CFN) to estimate the pseudo count and further epistemic
uncertainty over reasoning trajectories, and converts them into an intrinsic
reward that values novelty while preserving the learning signal from task
rewards. We integrate MERCI into some advanced RL frameworks like Group
Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Experiments on complex reasoning
benchmarks demonstrate that MERCI encourages richer and more varied chains of
thought, significantly improves performance over strong baselines, and helps
the policy escape local routines to discover better solutions. It indicates
that our targeted intrinsic motivation can make exploration reliable for
language model reasoning.

Abstract: The advent of large-scale artificial intelligence (AI) models has a
transformative effect on neuroscience research, which represents a paradigm
shift from the traditional computational methods through the facilitation of
end-to-end learning from raw brain signals and neural data. In this paper, we
explore the transformative effects of large-scale AI models on five major
neuroscience domains: neuroimaging and data processing, brain-computer
interfaces and neural decoding, molecular neuroscience and genomic modeling,
clinical assistance and translational frameworks, and disease-specific
applications across neurological and psychiatric disorders. These models are
demonstrated to address major computational neuroscience challenges, including
multimodal neural data integration, spatiotemporal pattern interpretation, and
the derivation of translational frameworks for clinical deployment. Moreover,
the interaction between neuroscience and AI has become increasingly reciprocal,
as biologically informed architectural constraints are now incorporated to
develop more interpretable and computationally efficient models. This review
highlights both the notable promise of such technologies and key implementation
considerations, with particular emphasis on rigorous evaluation frameworks,
effective domain knowledge integration, and comprehensive ethical guidelines
for clinical use. Finally, a systematic listing of critical neuroscience
datasets used to derive and validate large-scale AI models across diverse

<details>

Motivation: 当前基于LLM的方法在解决复杂VRP问题时仍需要外部干预，导致自主性受限、执行错误和解决方案可行性低的问题。

Method: AFL框架将整个流程分解为三个可管理的子任务，采用四个专门化智能体通过协调交互来确保跨功能一致性和逻辑合理性，直接从原始输入中提取知识并生成自包含代码。

Result: 在60个复杂VRP问题上的广泛实验表明，该框架在代码可靠性和解决方案可行性方面显著优于现有LLM基线，在评估基准上接近100%的成功率，与精心设计的算法性能相当。

Conclusion: AFL框架为复杂车辆路径问题提供了完全自动化的解决方案，显著提高了LLM方法的可靠性和可行性，展示了在无需人工干预情况下解决复杂优化问题的潜力。

Abstract: Complex vehicle routing problems (VRPs) remain a fundamental challenge,
demanding substantial expert effort for intent interpretation and algorithm
design. While large language models (LLMs) offer a promising path toward
automation, current approaches still rely on external intervention, which
restrict autonomy and often lead to execution errors and low solution
feasibility. To address these challenges, we propose an Agentic Framework with
LLMs (AFL) for solving complex vehicle routing problems, achieving full
automation from problem instance to solution. AFL directly extracts knowledge
from raw inputs and enables self-contained code generation without handcrafted
modules or external solvers. To improve trustworthiness, AFL decomposes the
overall pipeline into three manageable subtasks and employs four specialized
agents whose coordinated interactions enforce cross-functional consistency and
logical soundness. Extensive experiments on 60 complex VRPs, ranging from
standard benchmarks to practical variants, validate the effectiveness and
generality of our framework, showing comparable performance against
meticulously designed algorithms. Notably, it substantially outperforms
existing LLM-based baselines in both code reliability and solution feasibility,
achieving rates close to 100% on the evaluated benchmarks.

Abstract: The rapid evolution of agentic AI marks a new phase in artificial
intelligence, where Large Language Models (LLMs) no longer merely respond but
act, reason, and adapt. This survey traces the paradigm shift in building
agentic AI: from Pipeline-based systems, where planning, tool use, and memory
are orchestrated by external logic, to the emerging Model-native paradigm,
where these capabilities are internalized within the model's parameters. We
first position Reinforcement Learning (RL) as the algorithmic engine enabling
this paradigm shift. By reframing learning from imitating static data to
outcome-driven exploration, RL underpins a unified solution of LLM + RL + Task
across language, vision and embodied domains. Building on this, the survey
systematically reviews how each capability -- Planning, Tool use, and Memory --
has evolved from externally scripted modules to end-to-end learned behaviors.
Furthermore, it examines how this paradigm shift has reshaped major agent
applications, specifically the Deep Research agent emphasizing long-horizon
reasoning and the GUI agent emphasizing embodied interaction. We conclude by
discussing the continued internalization of agentic capabilities like
Multi-agent collaboration and Reflection, alongside the evolving roles of the
system and model layers in future agentic AI. Together, these developments
outline a coherent trajectory toward model-native agentic AI as an integrated
learning and interaction framework, marking the transition from constructing
systems that apply intelligence to developing models that grow intelligence
through experience.

Abstract: The advent of large language models (LLMs) has transformed information access
and reasoning through open-ended natural language interaction. However, LLMs
remain limited by static knowledge, factual hallucinations, and the inability
to retrieve real-time or domain-specific information. Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG) mitigates these issues by grounding model outputs in external
evidence, but traditional RAG pipelines are often single turn and heuristic,
lacking adaptive control over retrieval and reasoning. Recent advances in
agentic search address these limitations by enabling LLMs to plan, retrieve,
and reflect through multi-step interaction with search environments. Within
this paradigm, reinforcement learning (RL) offers a powerful mechanism for
adaptive and self-improving search behavior. This survey provides the first
comprehensive overview of \emph{RL-based agentic search}, organizing the
emerging field along three complementary dimensions: (i) What RL is for
(functional roles), (ii) How RL is used (optimization strategies), and (iii)
Where RL is applied (scope of optimization). We summarize representative
methods, evaluation protocols, and applications, and discuss open challenges
and future directions toward building reliable and scalable RL driven agentic
search systems. We hope this survey will inspire future research on the
integration of RL and agentic search. Our repository is available at

Abstract: Complex systems are increasingly explored through simulation-driven
engineering workflows that combine physics-based and empirical models with
optimization and analytics. Despite their power, these workflows face two
central obstacles: (1) high computational cost, since accurate exploration
requires many expensive simulator runs; and (2) limited transparency and
reliability when decisions rely on opaque blackbox components. We propose a
workflow that addresses both challenges by training lightweight emulators on
compact designs of experiments that (i) provide fast, low-latency
approximations of expensive simulators, (ii) enable rigorous uncertainty
quantification, and (iii) are adapted for global and local Explainable
Artificial Intelligence (XAI) analyses. This workflow unifies every
simulation-based complex-system analysis tool, ranging from engineering design
to agent-based models for socio-environmental understanding. In this paper, we
proposea comparative methodology and practical recommendations for using
surrogate-based explainability tools within the proposed workflow. The
methodology supports continuous and categorical inputs, combines global-effect
and uncertainty analyses with local attribution, and evaluates the consistency
of explanations across surrogate models, thereby diagnosing surrogate adequacy
and guiding further data collection or model refinement. We demonstrate the
approach on two contrasting case studies: a multidisciplinary design analysis
of a hybrid-electric aircraft and an agent-based model of urban segregation.
Results show that the surrogate model and XAI coupling enables large-scale
exploration in seconds, uncovers nonlinear interactions and emergent behaviors,
identifies key design and policy levers, and signals regions where surrogates
require more data or alternative architectures.

Method: 提出多视图视觉令牌压缩器(MVTC)基于多头注意力机制压缩图像令牌，并设计注意力剪枝策略减少冗余层，使用线性投影补偿性能损失

Result: 在FB15k-237-IMG和WN18-IMG基准测试中达到最先进性能，同时显著提升计算效率

Conclusion: ELMM为多模态知识图谱补全建立了新范式，在保持高性能的同时大幅降低计算成本

Abstract: Multimodal Knowledge Graphs (MKGs) extend traditional knowledge graphs by
incorporating visual and textual modalities, enabling richer and more
expressive entity representations. However, existing MKGs often suffer from
incompleteness, which hinder their effectiveness in downstream tasks.
Therefore, multimodal knowledge graph completion (MKGC) task is receiving
increasing attention. While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise for
knowledge graph completion (KGC), their application to the multimodal setting
remains underexplored. Moreover, applying Multimodal Large Language Models
(MLLMs) to the task of MKGC introduces significant challenges: (1) the large
number of image tokens per entity leads to semantic noise and modality
conflicts, and (2) the high computational cost of processing large token
inputs. To address these issues, we propose Efficient Lightweight Multimodal
Large Language Models (ELMM) for MKGC. ELMM proposes a Multi-view Visual Token
Compressor (MVTC) based on multi-head attention mechanism, which adaptively
compresses image tokens from both textual and visual views, thereby effectively
reducing redundancy while retaining necessary information and avoiding modality
conflicts. Additionally, we design an attention pruning strategy to remove
redundant attention layers from MLLMs, thereby significantly reducing the
inference cost. We further introduce a linear projection to compensate for the
performance degradation caused by pruning. Extensive experiments on benchmark
FB15k-237-IMG and WN18-IMG demonstrate that ELMM achieves state-of-the-art
performance while substantially improving computational efficiency,
establishing a new paradigm for multimodal knowledge graph completion.

Conclusion: ELLSA朝着更自然和通用的交互智能迈出了一步，为追求通用人工智能做出贡献。

Abstract: Human interaction is inherently multimodal and full-duplex: we listen while
watching, speak while acting, and fluidly adapt to turn-taking and
interruptions. Realizing these capabilities is essential for building models
simulating humans. We present ELLSA (End-to-end Listen, Look, Speak and Act),
which, to our knowledge, is the first full-duplex, end-to-end model that
simultaneously perceives and generates across vision, text, speech, and action
within a single architecture, enabling interaction patterns previously out of
reach, yielding more natural, human-like behaviors. At its core is a novel
SA-MoE architecture (Self-Attention Mixture-of-Experts) that routes each
modality to specialized experts and fuses them through a unified attention
backbone. This provides a generalizable solution for joint multimodal
perception and concurrent generation, leveraging strong pre-trained components
while enabling efficient modality integration and mitigating modality
interference. On speech-interaction and robot-manipulation benchmarks, ELLSA
matches modality-specific baselines, while uniquely supporting advanced
multimodal and full-duplex behaviors such as dialogue and action turn-taking,
defective instruction rejection, speaking-while-acting, context-grounded visual
question answering, and action barge-ins. We contend that ELLSA represents a
step toward more natural and general interactive intelligence, contributing to
the broader pursuit of artificial general intelligence. All data, code and
model checkpoints will be released upon acceptance.

enhances both scalability and modality coordination in graph understanding. For
scalability, GraphVista organizes graph information hierarchically into a
lightweight GraphRAG base, which retrieves only task-relevant textual
descriptions and high-resolution visual subgraphs, compressing redundant
context while preserving key reasoning elements. For modality coordination,
GraphVista introduces a planning agent that routes tasks to the most suitable
modality-using the text modality for simple property reasoning and the visual
modality for local and structurally complex reasoning grounded in explicit
topology. Extensive experiments demonstrate that GraphVista scales to large
graphs, up to $200\times$ larger than those used in existing benchmarks, and
consistently outperforms existing textual, visual, and fusion-based methods,
achieving up to $4.4\times$ quality improvement over the state-of-the-art
baselines by fully exploiting the complementary strengths of both modalities.

### [489] [Domain-Contextualized Concept Graphs: A Computable Framework for Knowledge Representation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16802)
*Chao Li,Yuru Wang*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了领域情境化概念图(CDC)，将领域作为知识表示的一等元素，使用<概念, 关系@领域, 概念'>的三元组结构，实现上下文感知推理和跨领域类比。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统知识图谱受限于固定的本体论，概念被组织在僵化的层次结构中，根本原因在于将领域视为隐含上下文而非显式的推理级组件。

Method: 采用C-D-C三元组结构<概念, 关系@领域, 概念'>，领域规范作为按需定义的动态分类维度，基于认知-语言同构映射原理，形式化20多个标准化关系谓词，并在Prolog中实现完整推理能力。

Result: 在教育、企业知识系统和技术文档等案例研究中，CDC实现了上下文感知推理、跨领域类比和个性化知识建模，这些能力在传统基于本体的框架中无法实现。

Conclusion: CDC框架通过将领域提升为概念表示的一等元素，克服了传统知识图谱的局限性，为上下文感知的知识建模和推理提供了新的可能性。

Abstract: Traditional knowledge graphs are constrained by fixed ontologies that
organize concepts within rigid hierarchical structures. The root cause lies in
treating domains as implicit context rather than as explicit, reasoning-level
components. To overcome these limitations, we propose the Domain-Contextualized
Concept Graph (CDC), a novel knowledge modeling framework that elevates domains
to first-class elements of conceptual representation. CDC adopts a C-D-C triple
structure - <Concept, Relation@Domain, Concept'> - where domain specifications
serve as dynamic classification dimensions defined on demand. Grounded in a
cognitive-linguistic isomorphic mapping principle, CDC operationalizes how
humans understand concepts through contextual frames. We formalize more than
twenty standardized relation predicates (structural, logical, cross-domain, and
temporal) and implement CDC in Prolog for full inference capability. Case
studies in education, enterprise knowledge systems, and technical documentation
demonstrate that CDC enables context-aware reasoning, cross-domain analogy, and
personalized knowledge modeling - capabilities unattainable under traditional
ontology-based frameworks.

TL;DR: DeepAnalyze-8B是首个用于自主数据科学的智能LLM代理，能够从数据源自动完成端到端的数据分析流程，生成分析师级别的深度研究报告。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于工作流的数据代理在特定数据任务上表现良好，但由于依赖预定义工作流，无法实现完全自主的数据科学。随着强大LLM的出现，自主数据科学变得可行。

Method: 提出基于课程学习的智能代理训练范式，模拟人类数据科学家的学习轨迹，使LLM能够在真实环境中逐步获取和整合多种能力。同时引入数据驱动的轨迹合成框架构建高质量训练数据。

Result: 实验表明，仅8B参数的DeepAnalyze在性能上超越了基于最先进专有LLM构建的先前工作流代理。

Conclusion: DeepAnalyze模型、代码和训练数据已开源，为自主数据科学的发展铺平了道路。

Abstract: Autonomous data science, from raw data sources to analyst-grade deep research
reports, has been a long-standing challenge, and is now becoming feasible with
the emergence of powerful large language models (LLMs). Recent workflow-based
data agents have shown promising results on specific data tasks but remain
fundamentally limited in achieving fully autonomous data science due to their
reliance on predefined workflows. In this paper, we introduce DeepAnalyze-8B,
the first agentic LLM designed for autonomous data science, capable of
automatically completing the end-toend pipeline from data sources to
analyst-grade deep research reports. To tackle high-complexity data science
tasks, we propose a curriculum-based agentic training paradigm that emulates
the learning trajectory of human data scientists, enabling LLMs to
progressively acquire and integrate multiple capabilities in real-world
environments. We also introduce a data-grounded trajectory synthesis framework
that constructs high-quality training data. Through agentic training,
DeepAnalyze learns to perform a broad spectrum of data tasks, ranging from data
question answering and specialized analytical tasks to open-ended data
research. Experiments demonstrate that, with only 8B parameters, DeepAnalyze
outperforms previous workflow-based agents built on most advanced proprietary
LLMs. The model, code, and training data of DeepAnalyze are open-sourced,
paving the way toward autonomous data science.

Motivation: 解决VLM代理从文本状态转向复杂视觉观察时的部分可观测性挑战，探索代理是否能通过显式视觉状态推理构建内部世界模型。

Method: 将代理推理过程架构化为POMDP，分解为状态估计和转移建模，设计世界建模奖励和双层次GAE进行密集监督和信用分配。

Result: 3B参数模型在五个代理基准测试中达到0.82分，相比未训练模型(0.21)提升3倍，优于GPT-5(0.75)、Gemini 2.5 Pro(0.67)和Claude 4.5(0.62)。

Conclusion: 通过视觉状态推理，VLM代理能够构建有效的内部世界模型，最优表示形式取决于任务类型，该方法显著提升了代理性能。

Abstract: A key challenge in training Vision-Language Model (VLM) agents, compared to
Language Model (LLM) agents, lies in the shift from textual states to complex
visual observations. This transition introduces partial observability and
demands robust world modeling. We ask: Can VLM agents construct internal world
models through explicit visual state reasoning? To address this question, we
architecturally enforce and reward the agent's reasoning process via
reinforcement learning (RL), formulating it as a Partially Observable Markov
Decision Process (POMDP). We find that decomposing the agent's reasoning into
State Estimation ("what is the current state?") and Transition Modeling ("what
comes next?") is critical for success, as demonstrated through five reasoning
strategies. Our investigation into how agents represent internal beliefs
reveals that the optimal representation is task-dependent: Natural Language
excels at capturing semantic relationships in general tasks, while Structured
formats are indispensable for precise manipulation and control. Building on
these insights, we design a World Modeling Reward that provides dense,
turn-level supervision for accurate state prediction, and introduce Bi-Level
General Advantage Estimation (Bi-Level GAE) for turn-aware credit assignment.
Through this form of visual state reasoning, a 3B-parameter model achieves a
score of 0.82 across five diverse agent benchmarks, representing a 3$\times$
improvement over its untrained counterpart (0.21) and outperforming proprietary
reasoning models such as GPT-5 (0.75), Gemini 2.5 Pro (0.67) and Claude 4.5
(0.62). All experiments are conducted within our VAGEN framework, a scalable
system for training and analyzing multi-turn VLM agents in diverse visual
environments. Code and data are publicly available at

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的评估方法，用于测试用户能否从强化学习算法的决策解释中识别出智能体的目标。在Ms. Pacman环境中测试了四种可解释强化学习算法，发现只有一种算法的准确率高于随机水平，且用户普遍高估了自己的选择准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 可解释强化学习算法的核心应用之一是调试，但目前缺乏对其相对性能的比较评估。

Method: 使用Atari的Ms. Pacman环境和四种可解释强化学习算法，通过用户研究测试他们是否能从算法提供的决策解释中识别智能体的目标。

Result: 只有一种算法的准确率高于随机水平；用户普遍对自己的选择过于自信；用户自我报告的识别和理解难易程度与他们的实际准确率不相关。

Conclusion: 当前可解释强化学习算法在帮助用户理解智能体目标方面的效果有限，需要改进评估方法和算法设计。

Abstract: Debugging is a core application of explainable reinforcement learning (XRL)
algorithms; however, limited comparative evaluations have been conducted to
understand their relative performance. We propose a novel evaluation
methodology to test whether users can identify an agent's goal from an
explanation of its decision-making. Utilising the Atari's Ms. Pacman
environment and four XRL algorithms, we find that only one achieved greater
than random accuracy for the tested goals and that users were generally
overconfident in their selections. Further, we find that users' self-reported
ease of identification and understanding for every explanation did not
correlate with their accuracy.

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于LLM的多智能体框架，用于GPU内核优化，通过系统化探索设计空间，显著提升了内核性能和优化成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GPU内核效率对现代AI发展至关重要，但优化过程复杂且劳动密集。现有LLM方法在应对不规则的内核优化场景时效果有限。

Method: 采用多智能体协作框架，结合基础指令、动态上下文管理和策略搜索，模拟专家工程师的工作流程，让LLM能够推理硬件权衡、整合性能分析反馈并进行迭代优化。

Result: 在KernelBench基准测试中，系统在基线方法经常失败的情况下仍能产生正确解，并实现了高达16倍的运行时性能提升。

Conclusion: 智能体LLM框架具有推动完全自动化、可扩展GPU内核优化的潜力。

Abstract: The efficiency of GPU kernels is central to the progress of modern AI, yet
optimizing them remains a difficult and labor-intensive task due to complex
interactions between memory hierarchies, thread scheduling, and
hardware-specific characteristics. While recent advances in large language
models (LLMs) provide new opportunities for automated code generation, existing
approaches largely treat LLMs as single-shot generators or naive refinement
tools, limiting their effectiveness in navigating the irregular kernel
optimization landscape. We introduce an LLM agentic framework for GPU kernel
optimization that systematically explores the design space through multi-agent
collaboration, grounded instruction, dynamic context management, and strategic
search. This framework mimics the workflow of expert engineers, enabling LLMs
to reason about hardware trade-offs, incorporate profiling feedback, and refine
kernels iteratively. We evaluate our approach on KernelBench, a benchmark for
LLM-based kernel optimization, and demonstrate substantial improvements over
baseline agents: our system produces correct solutions where baselines often
fail, and achieves kernels with up to 16x faster runtime performance. These
results highlight the potential of agentic LLM frameworks to advance fully
automated, scalable GPU kernel optimization.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: ToolCritic是一个诊断框架，用于评估和改进增强工具的大型语言模型在多轮对话中的行为，通过检测8种工具调用错误并提供针对性反馈，使主LLM修正响应，在SGD数据集上比基线方法提升工具调用准确率高达13%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工具增强的LLM在现实应用中越来越普遍，但工具使用错误仍然阻碍其可靠性，需要解决多轮对话中工具调用的错误问题。

Method: 提出ToolCritic框架，检测8种特定的工具调用错误类型（如过早调用、参数不对齐、工具输出误解等），并为具有强推理能力的主LLM提供针对性反馈，使其修正响应。通过系统定义错误类别并构建合成数据集来训练ToolCritic。

Result: 在Schema-Guided Dialogue数据集上的实验结果表明，ToolCritic相比基线方法（包括零样本提示和自校正技术）将工具调用准确率提升了高达13%。

Conclusion: ToolCritic代表了在现实世界对话应用中更稳健地将LLM与外部工具集成的有希望的一步。

Abstract: Tool-augmented large language models (LLMs) are increasingly employed in
real-world applications, but tool usage errors still hinder their reliability.
We introduce ToolCritic, a diagnostic framework that evaluates and improves LLM
behavior in multi-turn, tool-augmented dialogues. ToolCritic detects eight
distinct error types specific to tool-calling (e.g., premature invocation,
argument misalignment, and misinterpretation of tool outputs) and provides
targeted feedback to the main LLM. The main LLM, assumed to have strong
reasoning, task understanding and orchestration capabilities, then revises its
response based on ToolCritic's feedback. We systematically define these error
categories and construct a synthetic dataset to train ToolCritic. Experimental
results on the Schema-Guided Dialogue (SGD) dataset demonstrate that ToolCritic
improves tool-calling accuracy by up to 13% over baselines, including zero-shot
prompting and self-correction techniques. This represents a promising step
toward more robust LLM integration with external tools in real-world dialogue
applications.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单细胞RNA测序能识别多样细胞类型，但注释这些特征，特别是涉及未知基因的特征，仍然是一个主要挑战。传统方法如GSEA依赖精心策划的注释，在这些情况下表现不佳。

Method: 开发了BRAINCELL-AID多智能体AI系统，整合自由文本描述和本体标签，采用检索增强生成(RAG)技术，通过相关PubMed文献精炼预测，减少幻觉并增强可解释性。

Result: 在小鼠基因集的顶级预测中实现了77%的正确注释率，应用该方法注释了BRAIN Initiative Cell Census Network生成的5,322个脑细胞簇，识别了区域特异性基因共表达模式，并推断基因集合的功能角色。

Conclusion: BRAINCELL-AID成功识别了与基底神经节相关的细胞类型，并提供了神经学上有意义的描述，创建了一个支持社区驱动细胞类型注释的宝贵资源。

Abstract: Single-cell RNA sequencing has transformed our ability to identify diverse
cell types and their transcriptomic signatures. However, annotating these
signatures-especially those involving poorly characterized genes-remains a
major challenge. Traditional methods, such as Gene Set Enrichment Analysis
(GSEA), depend on well-curated annotations and often perform poorly in these
contexts. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising alternative but
struggle to represent complex biological knowledge within structured
ontologies. To address this, we present BRAINCELL-AID (BRAINCELL-AID:
https://biodataai.uth.edu/BRAINCELL-AID), a novel multi-agent AI system that
integrates free-text descriptions with ontology labels to enable more accurate
and robust gene set annotation. By incorporating retrieval-augmented generation
(RAG), we developed a robust agentic workflow that refines predictions using
relevant PubMed literature, reducing hallucinations and enhancing
interpretability. Using this workflow, we achieved correct annotations for 77%
of mouse gene sets among their top predictions. Applying this approach, we
annotated 5,322 brain cell clusters from the comprehensive mouse brain cell
atlas generated by the BRAIN Initiative Cell Census Network, enabling novel
insights into brain cell function by identifying region-specific gene
co-expression patterns and inferring functional roles of gene ensembles.
BRAINCELL-AID also identifies Basal Ganglia-related cell types with
neurologically meaningful descriptions. Hence, we create a valuable resource to
support community-driven cell type annotation.

TL;DR: 本研究开发了两种基于大语言模型的系统（单代理系统和辩论式多代理系统）来自动化企业信用评估中的证据推理，相比人工评估实现了显著效率提升，其中多代理系统在推理质量上表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前金融AI主要关注数值预测，但在企业信用评估中，定性非财务指标对贷款偿还结果具有决定性影响却难以形式化，需要支持专业贷款评估所需的解释性判断。

Method: 开发了两种LLM系统：单代理系统（NAS）通过单次推理流程生成双向分析；辩论式多代理系统（KPD-MADS）基于卡尔·波普批判对话框架，采用十步结构化交互协议进行对抗性验证。

Result: 两种系统在三个真实企业案例中测试，相比人工评估（1920秒/案例）实现显著效率提升（NAS：11.55秒；KPD-MADS：91.97秒）。KPD-MADS在解释充分性、实际应用性和可用性方面获得更高评分。

Conclusion: 结构化多代理交互能够增强金融AI中的推理严谨性和可解释性，推动企业信用评估的可扩展和可辩护自动化。

Abstract: Despite advances in financial AI, the automation of evidence-based reasoning
remains unresolved in corporate credit assessment, where qualitative
non-financial indicators exert decisive influence on loan repayment outcomes
yet resist formalization. Existing approaches focus predominantly on numerical
prediction and provide limited support for the interpretive judgments required
in professional loan evaluation. This study develops and evaluates two
operational large language model (LLM)-based systems designed to generate
structured reasoning from non-financial evidence. The first is a
non-adversarial single-agent system (NAS) that produces bidirectional analysis
through a single-pass reasoning pipeline. The second is a debate-based
multi-agent system (KPD-MADS) that operationalizes adversarial verification
through a ten-step structured interaction protocol grounded in Karl Popper's
critical dialogue framework. Both systems were applied to three real corporate
cases and evaluated by experienced credit risk professionals. Compared to
manual expert reporting, both systems achieved substantial productivity gains
(NAS: 11.55 s per case; KPD-MADS: 91.97 s; human baseline: 1920 s). The
KPD-MADS demonstrated superior reasoning quality, receiving higher median
ratings in explanatory adequacy (4.0 vs. 3.0), practical applicability (4.0 vs.
3.0), and usability (62.5 vs. 52.5). These findings show that structured
multi-agent interaction can enhance reasoning rigor and interpretability in
financial AI, advancing scalable and defensible automation in corporate credit
assessment.

Motivation: 传统感官评估鱼类新鲜度存在主观性、不一致性和难以标准化的问题，需要客观、自动化的解决方案来确保食品质量和消费者健康。

Method: 从鱼眼图像中系统提取和增量融合互补特征描述符，包括颜色统计、多色彩空间直方图、局部二值模式(LBP)和灰度共生矩阵(GLCM)等纹理特征，同时捕获全局色彩变化和局部ROI区域退化。

Result: 在FFE数据集上，LightGBM分类器达到77.56%准确率，比之前深度学习基线提升14.35%；使用增强数据时，人工神经网络达到97.16%准确率，比之前最佳结果提升19.86%。

Conclusion: 精心设计的工特征经过策略性处理后，能够为自动化鱼类新鲜度评估提供鲁棒、可解释且可靠的解决方案，为食品质量监控的实际应用提供有价值见解。

Abstract: Accurate assessment of fish freshness remains a major challenge in the food
industry, with direct consequences for product quality, market value, and
consumer health. Conventional sensory evaluation is inherently subjective,
inconsistent, and difficult to standardize across contexts, often limited by
subtle, species-dependent spoilage cues. To address these limitations, we
propose a handcrafted feature-based approach that systematically extracts and
incrementally fuses complementary descriptors, including color statistics,
histograms across multiple color spaces, and texture features such as Local
Binary Patterns (LBP) and Gray-Level Co-occurrence Matrices (GLCM), from fish
eye images. Our method captures global chromatic variations from full images
and localized degradations from ROI segments, fusing each independently to
evaluate their effectiveness in assessing freshness. Experiments on the
Freshness of the Fish Eyes (FFE) dataset demonstrate the approach's
effectiveness: in a standard train-test setting, a LightGBM classifier achieved
77.56% accuracy, a 14.35% improvement over the previous deep learning baseline
of 63.21%. With augmented data, an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) reached
97.16% accuracy, surpassing the prior best of 77.3% by 19.86%. These results
demonstrate that carefully engineered, handcrafted features, when strategically
processed, yield a robust, interpretable, and reliable solution for automated
fish freshness assessment, providing valuable insights for practical
applications in food quality monitoring.

Motivation: HVAC系统能耗占建筑能耗很大比例，传统基于规则的方法可解释但缺乏适应性，深度学习方法预测能力强但缺乏透明度和物理合理性，现有LLM方法忽视了HVAC运行的物理原理。

Method: 提出PILLM框架，在进化循环中嵌入物理知识反射和交叉算子，结合热力学和控制理论约束，自动生成、评估和优化异常检测规则。

Result: 在公共建筑故障检测数据集上的实验表明，PILLM达到了最先进的性能，同时生成可解释和可操作的诊断规则。

Conclusion: PILLM推动了智能建筑系统中可信赖和可部署AI的发展，实现了自适应且物理基础的异常检测。

Abstract: Heating, Ventilation, and Air-Conditioning (HVAC) systems account for a
substantial share of global building energy use, making reliable anomaly
detection essential for improving efficiency and reducing emissions. Classical
rule-based approaches offer explainability but lack adaptability, while deep
learning methods provide predictive power at the cost of transparency,
efficiency, and physical plausibility. Recent attempts to use Large Language
Models (LLMs) for anomaly detection improve interpretability but largely ignore
the physical principles that govern HVAC operations. We present PILLM, a
Physics-Informed LLM framework that operates within an evolutionary loop to
automatically generate, evaluate, and refine anomaly detection rules. Our
approach introduces physics-informed reflection and crossover operators that
embed thermodynamic and control-theoretic constraints, enabling rules that are
both adaptive and physically grounded. Experiments on the public Building Fault
Detection dataset show that PILLM achieves state-of-the-art performance while
producing diagnostic rules that are interpretable and actionable, advancing
trustworthy and deployable AI for smart building systems.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多智能体系统的通信协议选择缺乏标准化指导，往往基于直觉而非数据驱动，这影响了系统性能和可靠性。

Method: 开发ProtocolBench基准测试，从任务成功率、端到端延迟、消息开销和故障恢复能力四个维度评估协议；设计ProtocolRouter学习型路由器，根据需求和运行时信号选择最优协议。

Result: 协议选择显著影响系统性能：在流式队列场景中，完成时间差异达36.5%，端到端延迟差异3.48秒；ProtocolRouter相比最佳单协议基线，故障恢复时间减少18.1%，在GAIA场景中成功率更高。

Conclusion: 协议选择对多智能体系统性能至关重要，ProtocolBench和ProtocolRouter为协议评估和选择提供了标准化方法和工具，能显著提升系统可靠性。

Abstract: As large-scale multi-agent systems evolve, the communication protocol layer
has become a critical yet under-evaluated factor shaping performance and
reliability. Despite the existence of diverse protocols (A2A, ACP, ANP, Agora,
etc.), selection is often intuition-driven and lacks standardized guidance. We
introduce ProtocolBench, a benchmark that systematically compares agent
protocols along four measurable axes: task success, end-to-end latency, message
or byte overhead, and robustness under failures. On ProtocolBench, protocol
choice significantly influences system behavior. In the Streaming Queue
scenario, overall completion time varies by up to 36.5% across protocols, and
mean end-to-end latency differs by 3.48 s. Under Fail-Storm Recovery,
resilience also differs consistently across protocols. Beyond evaluation, we
present ProtocolRouter, a learnable protocol router that selects per-scenario
(or per-module) protocols from requirement and runtime signals. ProtocolRouter
reduces Fail-Storm recovery time by up to 18.1% versus the best single-protocol
baseline, and achieves scenario-specific gains such as higher success in GAIA.
We also release ProtocolRouterBench to standardize protocol evaluation and
improve reliability at scale.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 急性心肌梗死后恶性室性心律失常是院内死亡的主要原因，传统风险评分性能有限，端到端深度学习模型缺乏临床信任所需的可解释性。

Method: 使用ECGFounder基础模型提取150维诊断概率特征，通过特征选择后训练XGBoost分类器，并采用SHAP方法进行可解释性分析。

Result: 混合模型AUC达到0.801，优于KNN(0.677)、RNN(0.676)和1D-CNN(0.720)。SHAP分析显示模型识别特征与临床知识高度一致。

Conclusion: 该混合框架为VT/VF风险预测提供了新范式，验证了基础模型输出可作为有效、自动化的特征工程，用于构建可信赖、可解释的AI临床决策支持系统。

Abstract: Malignant ventricular arrhythmias (VT/VF) following acute myocardial
infarction (AMI) are a major cause of in-hospital death, yet early
identification remains a clinical challenge. While traditional risk scores have
limited performance, end-to-end deep learning models often lack the
interpretability needed for clinical trust. This study aimed to develop a
hybrid predictive framework that integrates a large-scale electrocardiogram
(ECG) foundation model (ECGFounder) with an interpretable XGBoost classifier to
improve both accuracy and interpretability. We analyzed 6,634 ECG recordings
from AMI patients, among whom 175 experienced in-hospital VT/VF. The ECGFounder
model was used to extract 150-dimensional diagnostic probability features ,
which were then refined through feature selection to train the XGBoost
classifier. Model performance was evaluated using AUC and F1-score , and the
SHAP method was used for interpretability. The ECGFounder + XGBoost hybrid
model achieved an AUC of 0.801 , outperforming KNN (AUC 0.677), RNN (AUC
0.676), and an end-to-end 1D-CNN (AUC 0.720). SHAP analysis revealed that
model-identified key features, such as "premature ventricular complexes" (risk
predictor) and "normal sinus rhythm" (protective factor), were highly
consistent with clinical knowledge. We conclude that this hybrid framework
provides a novel paradigm for VT/VF risk prediction by validating the use of
foundation model outputs as effective, automated feature engineering for
building trustworthy, explainable AI-based clinical decision support systems.

over factorized decision heads (Tool/Style) shows that a uniform heavy-tool
policy raises average value on logs but harms specific subgroups, most notably
low-health-literacy/high-self-efficacy users. A lightweight simulator with
hidden archetypes further shows that adding a small early information-gain
bonus reliably shortens trait identification and improves goal success and
pass@3. Together, these early findings indicate an evaluation-first path to
personalization: freeze the generator, learn subgroup-aware decision heads on
typed rewards (objective tool outcomes and satisfaction), and always report
per-archetype metrics to surface subgroup harms that averages obscure.

TL;DR: 提出了TD-HNODE模型，使用时间详细超图和神经ODE框架来建模疾病进展的连续时间动态，在2型糖尿病和心血管疾病进展建模中表现优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 疾病进展建模面临挑战：需要基于不规则时间事件样本学习连续时间动态，处理患者异质性（不同进展速率和路径）。现有方法要么缺乏从真实数据学习的适应性，要么无法捕捉复杂的连续时间动态。

Method: TD-HNODE模型将疾病进展表示为时间详细超图，通过神经ODE框架学习连续时间进展动态，包含可学习的TD-Hypergraph Laplacian来捕捉疾病并发症标记在进展轨迹内和轨迹间的相互依赖关系。

Result: 在两个真实世界临床数据集上的实验表明，TD-HNODE在建模2型糖尿病和相关心血管疾病进展方面优于多个基线方法。

Conclusion: TD-HNODE能够有效建模疾病进展的连续时间动态，为患者亚型分类和及时干预提供了更好的工具。

Abstract: Disease progression modeling aims to characterize and predict how a patient's
disease complications worsen over time based on longitudinal electronic health
records (EHRs). Accurate modeling of disease progression, such as type 2
diabetes, can enhance patient sub-phenotyping and inform effective and timely
interventions. However, the problem is challenging due to the need to learn
continuous-time dynamics of progression patterns based on irregular-time event
samples and patient heterogeneity (\eg different progression rates and
pathways). Existing mechanistic and data-driven methods either lack
adaptability to learn from real-world data or fail to capture complex
continuous-time dynamics on progression trajectories. To address these
limitations, we propose Temporally Detailed Hypergraph Neural Ordinary
Differential Equation (TD-HNODE), which represents disease progression on
clinically recognized trajectories as a temporally detailed hypergraph and
learns the continuous-time progression dynamics via a neural ODE framework.
TD-HNODE contains a learnable TD-Hypergraph Laplacian that captures the
interdependency of disease complication markers within both intra- and
inter-progression trajectories. Experiments on two real-world clinical datasets
demonstrate that TD-HNODE outperforms multiple baselines in modeling the
progression of type 2 diabetes and related cardiovascular diseases.

Abstract: The cryptocurrency market offers significant investment opportunities but
faces challenges including high volatility and fragmented information. Data
integration and analysis are essential for informed investment decisions.
Currently, investors use three main approaches: (1) Manual analysis across
various sources, which depends heavily on individual experience and is
time-consuming and prone to bias; (2) Data aggregation platforms-limited in
functionality and depth of analysis; (3) Large language model agents-based on
static pretrained models, lacking real-time data integration and multi-step
reasoning capabilities. To address these limitations, we present Coinvisor, a
reinforcement learning-based chatbot that provides comprehensive analytical
support for cryptocurrency investment through a multi-agent framework.
Coinvisor integrates diverse analytical capabilities through specialized tools.
Its key innovation is a reinforcement learning-based tool selection mechanism
that enables multi-step planning and flexible integration of diverse data
sources. This design supports real-time interaction and adaptive analysis of
dynamic content, delivering accurate and actionable investment insights. We
evaluated Coinvisor through automated benchmarks on tool calling accuracy and
user studies with 20 cryptocurrency investors using our interface. Results show
that Coinvisor improves recall by 40.7% and F1 score by 26.6% over the base
model in tool orchestration. User studies show high satisfaction (4.64/5), with
participants preferring Coinvisor to both general LLMs and existing crypto
platforms (4.62/5).

Motivation: 现有方法在密集多智能体路径规划问题中难以实时找到接近最优解，纯搜索方法和纯学习方法各有局限，需要结合两者优势。

Method: 开发混合框架LaGAT，将改进的MAGAT神经网络策略集成到LaCAM搜索算法中，采用预训练-微调策略和死锁检测机制来处理不完美的神经引导。

Result: 在密集场景中，LaGAT表现优于纯搜索方法和纯学习方法，证明了混合搜索在挑战性多智能体协调问题中的有效性。

Conclusion: 精心设计的混合搜索方法为解决紧密耦合的挑战性多智能体协调问题提供了强大解决方案。

Abstract: Finding near-optimal solutions for dense multi-agent pathfinding (MAPF)
problems in real-time remains challenging even for state-of-the-art planners.
To this end, we develop a hybrid framework that integrates a learned heuristic
derived from MAGAT, a neural MAPF policy with a graph attention scheme, into a
leading search-based algorithm, LaCAM. While prior work has explored
learning-guided search in MAPF, such methods have historically underperformed.
In contrast, our approach, termed LaGAT, outperforms both purely search-based
and purely learning-based methods in dense scenarios. This is achieved through
an enhanced MAGAT architecture, a pre-train-then-fine-tune strategy on maps of
interest, and a deadlock detection scheme to account for imperfect neural
guidance. Our results demonstrate that, when carefully designed, hybrid search
offers a powerful solution for tightly coupled, challenging multi-agent
coordination problems.

TL;DR: 提出了FBI_LTL，一个用于仿真规划问题的多样化规划器，使用线性时序逻辑定义语义多样性标准，生成语义多样化的计划。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统规划器只生成单一计划，可能无法满足代理偏好。现有多样化规划方法可能产生语法不同但语义相同的解决方案。

Method: FBI_LTL利用线性时序逻辑定义语义多样性标准，并将这些LTL多样性模型直接集成到搜索过程中。

Result: 在各种基准测试中，FBI_LTL相比基线方法能生成更多样化的计划。

Conclusion: 这项工作确立了在仿真环境中语义引导多样化规划的可行性，为在传统基于模型方法失效的现实非符号领域开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Autonomous agents rely on automated planning algorithms to achieve their
objectives. Simulation-based planning offers a significant advantage over
declarative models in modelling complex environments. However, relying solely
on a planner that produces a single plan may not be practical, as the generated
plans may not always satisfy the agent's preferences. To address this
limitation, we introduce $\texttt{FBI}_\texttt{LTL}$, a diverse planner
explicitly designed for simulation-based planning problems.
$\texttt{FBI}_\texttt{LTL}$ utilises Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) to define
semantic diversity criteria, enabling agents to specify what constitutes
meaningfully different plans. By integrating these LTL-based diversity models
directly into the search process, $\texttt{FBI}_\texttt{LTL}$ ensures the
generation of semantically diverse plans, addressing a critical limitation of
existing diverse planning approaches that may produce syntactically different
but semantically identical solutions. Extensive evaluations on various
benchmarks consistently demonstrate that $\texttt{FBI}_\texttt{LTL}$ generates
more diverse plans compared to a baseline approach. This work establishes the
feasibility of semantically-guided diverse planning in simulation-based
environments, paving the way for innovative approaches in realistic,
non-symbolic domains where traditional model-based approaches fail.

Result: 开发了能够有效平衡探索与利用的路径规划方法，智能体能够逐步移动到最小化自由能量的位置。

Conclusion: 该方法成功解决了自主控制中的探索-利用权衡问题，为智能体侦察任务提供了有效的路径规划解决方案。

Abstract: We develop an active inference route-planning method for the autonomous
control of intelligent agents. The aim is to reconnoiter a geographical area to
maintain a common operational picture. To achieve this, we construct an
evidence map that reflects our current understanding of the situation,
incorporating both positive and "negative" sensor observations of possible
target objects collected over time, and diffusing the evidence across the map
as time progresses. The generative model of active inference uses
Dempster-Shafer theory and a Gaussian sensor model, which provides input to the
agent. The generative process employs a Bayesian approach to update a posterior
probability distribution. We calculate the variational free energy for all
positions within the area by assessing the divergence between a pignistic
probability distribution of the evidence map and a posterior probability
distribution of a target object based on the observations, including the level
of surprise associated with receiving new observations. Using the free energy,
we direct the agents' movements in a simulation by taking an incremental step
toward a position that minimizes the free energy. This approach addresses the
challenge of exploration and exploitation, allowing agents to balance searching
extensive areas of the geographical map while tracking identified target
objects.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 法律机器学习通常将过去案件结果视为真实标签，但法律结果常受和解、上诉等人为干预影响，造成标签不确定性，需要专门处理。

Method: 在欧洲人权法院案例分类的背景下，研究不同标签构建方式对模型行为的影响，探讨处理标签不确定性的方法。

Result: 研究发现标签构建方式显著影响模型行为，表明标签不确定性是AI与法律领域的重要关注点。

Conclusion: 标签不确定性是AI与法律领域的重要问题，需要在法律机器学习应用中予以考虑，因为它能显著影响模型行为。

Abstract: Machine learning is increasingly used in the legal domain, where it typically
operates retrospectively by treating past case outcomes as ground truth.
However, legal outcomes are often shaped by human interventions that are not
captured in most machine learning approaches. A final decision may result from
a settlement, an appeal, or other procedural actions. This creates label
indeterminacy: the outcome could have been different if the intervention had or
had not taken place. We argue that legal machine learning applications need to
account for label indeterminacy. Methods exist that can impute these
indeterminate labels, but they are all grounded in unverifiable assumptions. In
the context of classifying cases from the European Court of Human Rights, we
show that the way that labels are constructed during training can significantly
affect model behaviour. We therefore position label indeterminacy as a relevant
concern in AI & Law and demonstrate how it can shape model behaviour.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 代码生成不仅需要准确的token预测，更需要理解解决方案层面的结构关系。大型语言模型具备复杂推理能力，但部署成本高，因此需要将这种能力蒸馏到更小、更高效的模型中。

Method: 通过结构感知损失优化方法，训练小模型模拟大型语言模型的推理和问题解决能力，学习识别正确解决方案路径，建立问题定义与潜在解决方案之间的结构对应关系。

Result: 实验结果显示，经过微调的模型在MBPP、MBPP Plus和HumanEval基准测试中，在pass@1、平均数据流和平均语法匹配指标上显著优于基线模型。

Conclusion: 通过简单易实现的蒸馏过程，可以成功将大型语言模型的推理能力迁移到更小的模型中，实现高效且低成本的代码生成部署。

Abstract: Effective code generation with language models hinges on two critical
factors: accurately understanding the intent of the prompt and generating code
that applies algorithmic reasoning to produce correct solutions capable of
passing diverse test cases while adhering to the syntax of the target
programming language. Unlike other language tasks, code generation requires
more than accurate token prediction; it demands comprehension of solution-level
and structural relationships rather than merely generating the most likely
tokens. very large language model (VLLM) are capable of generating detailed
steps toward the correct solution of complex tasks where reasoning is crucial
in solving the problem. Such reasoning capabilities may be absent in smaller
language models. Therefore, in this work, we distill the reasoning capabilities
of a VLLM into a smaller, more efficient model that is faster and cheaper to
deploy. Our approach trains the model to emulate the reasoning and
problem-solving abilities of the VLLM by learning to identify correct solution
pathways and establishing a structural correspondence between problem
definitions and potential solutions through a novel method of structure-aware
loss optimization. This enables the model to transcend token-level generation
and to deeply grasp the overarching structure of solutions for given problems.
Experimental results show that our fine-tuned model, developed through a cheap
and simple to implement process, significantly outperforms our baseline model
in terms of pass@1, average data flow, and average syntax match metrics across
the MBPP, MBPP Plus, and HumanEval benchmarks.

Conclusion: LLMs作为预测工具已具备基础能力，但要实现卓越的预测智能仍需解决事件回忆准确性、数据理解和信息聚合效率等关键问题。

Abstract: Forecasting is not only a fundamental intellectual pursuit but also is of
significant importance to societal systems such as finance and economics. With
the rapid advances of large language models (LLMs) trained on Internet-scale
data, it raises the promise of employing LLMs to forecast real-world future
events, an emerging paradigm we call "LLM-as-a-Prophet". This paper
systematically investigates such predictive intelligence of LLMs. To this end,
we build Prophet Arena, a general evaluation benchmark that continuously
collects live forecasting tasks and decomposes each task into distinct pipeline
stages, in order to support our controlled and large-scale experimentation. Our
comprehensive evaluation reveals that many LLMs already exhibit impressive
forecasting capabilities, reflected in, e.g., their small calibration errors,
consistent prediction confidence and promising market returns. However, we also
uncover key bottlenecks towards achieving superior predictive intelligence via
LLM-as-a-Prophet, such as LLMs' inaccurate event recalls, misunderstanding of
data sources and slower information aggregation compared to markets when
resolution nears.

TL;DR: 该论文提出使用多智能体影响图(MAIDs)作为图形化框架来解决多智能体强化学习中的协调问题，设计了基于因果推断的目标干预范式，通过仅干预单个智能体来避免全局指导的困难。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在大规模多智能体强化学习中，对整个系统进行全局人工指导不切实际，而现有协调机制设计主要依赖经验研究，缺乏易用的研究工具。

Method: 引入多智能体影响图(MAIDs)作为分析框架，提出目标干预范式，使用预策略干预(PSI)因果推断技术实现，通过最大化因果效应来达成复合目标。

Result: 实验证明了目标干预的有效性，并验证了相关性图分析的结果。

Conclusion: MAIDs提供了一个有效的图形化框架来分析和设计MARL交互范式，目标干预能够缓解全局指导问题，PSI技术能够有效实现期望结果。

Abstract: Steering cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) towards
desired outcomes is challenging, particularly when the global guidance from a
human on the whole multi-agent system is impractical in a large-scale MARL. On
the other hand, designing mechanisms to coordinate agents most relies on
empirical studies, lacking a easy-to-use research tool. In this work, we employ
multi-agent influence diagrams (MAIDs) as a graphical framework to address the
above issues. First, we introduce interaction paradigms that leverage MAIDs to
analyze and visualize existing approaches in MARL. Then, we design a new
interaction paradigm based on MAIDs, referred to as targeted intervention that
is applied to only a single targeted agent, so the problem of global guidance
can be mitigated. In our implementation, we introduce a causal inference
technique-referred to as Pre-Strategy Intervention (PSI)-to realize the
targeted intervention paradigm. Since MAIDs can be regarded as a special class
of causal diagrams, a composite desired outcome that integrates the primary
task goal and an additional desired outcome can be achieved by maximizing the
corresponding causal effect through the PSI. Moreover, the bundled relevance
graph analysis of MAIDs provides a tool to identify whether an MARL learning
paradigm is workable under the design of an interaction paradigm. In
experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed targeted
intervention, and verify the result of relevance graph analysis.

Motivation: 大型语言模型在多任务适应中面临灾难性遗忘和资源消耗大的问题，现有参数高效方法在复杂多任务场景下表现不佳。

Method: 提出上下文注意力调制(CAM)机制动态调节自注意力模块表示，并结合共享全参数CAM模块与多个轻量级专用CAM模块，通过动态路由策略实现自适应知识融合。

Result: 在异构任务上的广泛实验表明，该方法显著优于现有方法，平均性能提升3.65%。

Conclusion: HyCAM框架通过上下文注意力调制有效平衡了知识保留与任务特定专业化，实现了更高效的多任务适应。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) possess remarkable generalization capabilities
but struggle with multi-task adaptation, particularly in balancing knowledge
retention with task-specific specialization. Conventional fine-tuning methods
suffer from catastrophic forgetting and substantial resource consumption, while
existing parameter-efficient methods perform suboptimally in complex multi-task
scenarios. To address this, we propose Contextual Attention Modulation (CAM), a
novel mechanism that dynamically modulates the representations of
self-attention modules in LLMs. CAM enhances task-specific features while
preserving general knowledge, thereby facilitating more effective and efficient
adaptation. For effective multi-task adaptation, CAM is integrated into our
Hybrid Contextual Attention Modulation (HyCAM) framework, which combines a
shared, full-parameter CAM module with multiple specialized, lightweight CAM
modules, enhanced by a dynamic routing strategy for adaptive knowledge fusion.
Extensive experiments on heterogeneous tasks, including question answering,
code generation, and logical reasoning, demonstrate that our approach
significantly outperforms existing approaches, achieving an average performance
improvement of 3.65%. The implemented code and data are available to ease
reproducibility at https://github.com/Applied-Machine-Learning-Lab/HyCAM.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视觉语言模型在多模态任务中表现良好，但即使存在正确的视觉证据时仍会失败。研究旨在系统性地探究这些失败是由于未感知证据还是未有效利用证据。

Method: 通过分析层级注意力动态，发现浅层主要关注文本，深层稀疏但可靠地关注局部证据区域。引入基于选择性注意力掩码的推理时干预方法，无需训练即可突出深层证据区域。

Result: VLMs在输出错误答案时往往已经感知到视觉证据。干预方法在LLaVA、Qwen、Gemma和InternVL等多个模型家族中一致提升了准确率。

Conclusion: 视觉语言模型内部编码了可靠的证据但未充分利用，使这些信号显式化可以弥合感知与推理之间的差距，推进对VLM的诊断理解和可靠性。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) achieve strong results on multimodal tasks such
as visual question answering, yet they can still fail even when the correct
visual evidence is present. In this work, we systematically investigate whether
these failures arise from not perceiving the evidence or from not leveraging it
effectively. By examining layer-wise attention dynamics, we find that shallow
layers focus primarily on text, while deeper layers sparsely but reliably
attend to localized evidence regions. Surprisingly, VLMs often perceive the
visual evidence when outputting incorrect answers, a phenomenon we term
``seeing but not believing'' that widely exists in major VLM families. Building
on this, we introduce an inference-time intervention that highlights deep-layer
evidence regions through selective attention-based masking. It requires no
training and consistently improves accuracy across multiple families, including
LLaVA, Qwen, Gemma, and InternVL. These results show that VLMs encode reliable
evidence internally but under-utilize it, making such signals explicit can
bridge the gap between perception and reasoning, advancing the diagnostic
understanding and reliability of VLMs.
