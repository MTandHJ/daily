### [1] [Fourier-Based GAN Fingerprint Detection using ResNet50](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19840)
*Sai Teja Erukude,Viswa Chaitanya Marella,Suhasnadh Reddy Veluru*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 使用频域分析和深度学习来区分StyleGAN生成的图像与真实图像，通过2D傅里叶变换检测周期性伪影，ResNet50模型在频域上达到92.8%准确率和0.95 AUC。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GAN生成的逼真图像对图像取证和工业系统的内容真实性构成挑战，需要可靠的方法来区分真实与合成图像。

Method: 应用二维离散傅里叶变换将图像转换到频域，使用ResNet50神经网络在频域图像上训练分类模型。

Result: 频域模型达到92.8%准确率和0.95 AUC，显著优于在原始空间域图像上训练的等效模型。

Conclusion: GAN生成图像具有独特的频域特征，结合信号处理和深度学习的方法在数字取证和工业AI系统可信度方面具有潜力。

Abstract: The rapid rise of photorealistic images produced from Generative Adversarial
Networks (GANs) poses a serious challenge for image forensics and industrial
systems requiring reliable content authenticity. This paper uses
frequency-domain analysis combined with deep learning to solve the problem of
distinguishing StyleGAN-generated images from real ones. Specifically, a
two-dimensional Discrete Fourier Transform (2D DFT) was applied to transform
images into the Fourier domain, where subtle periodic artifacts become
detectable. A ResNet50 neural network is trained on these transformed images to
differentiate between real and synthetic ones. The experiments demonstrate that
the frequency-domain model achieves a 92.8 percent and an AUC of 0.95,
significantly outperforming the equivalent model trained on raw spatial-domain
images. These results indicate that the GAN-generated images have unique
frequency-domain signatures or "fingerprints". The method proposed highlights
the industrial potential of combining signal processing techniques and deep
learning to enhance digital forensics and strengthen the trustworthiness of
industrial AI systems.

*Márcus Vinícius Lobo Costa,Sherlon Almeida da Silva,Bárbara Caroline Benato,Leo Sampaio Ferraz Ribeiro,Moacir Antonelli Ponti*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文研究了将Vision Transformers与对比学习目标结合用于3D形状特征表示学习，在ModelNet10上达到90.6%准确率，克服了CNN在捕捉形状关系方面的局限性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 计算机视觉方法在从2D图像识别3D物体时面临挑战，需要大量标注数据且CNN可能忽略重要的形状关系。

Method: 采用Vision Transformers架构与现代对比学习目标相结合，包括监督对比损失和自监督学习，进行多视角3D分析。

Result: 在ModelNet10数据集上，监督对比损失达到约90.6%的准确率，证明了ViT与对比学习结合的有效性。

Conclusion: ViT能够捕捉全局形状语义，对比学习优化局部判别特征，这种结合无需大量标注数据且能克服CNN的局限性，为3D表示学习提供了有效方案。

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenges in representation learning of 3D shape
features by investigating state-of-the-art backbones paired with both
contrastive supervised and self-supervised learning objectives. Computer vision
methods struggle with recognizing 3D objects from 2D images, often requiring
extensive labeled data and relying on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) that
may overlook crucial shape relationships. Our work demonstrates that Vision
Transformers (ViTs) based architectures, when paired with modern contrastive
objectives, achieve promising results in multi-view 3D analysis on our
downstream tasks, unifying contrastive and 3D shape understanding pipelines.
For example, supervised contrastive losses reached about 90.6% accuracy on
ModelNet10. The use of ViTs and contrastive learning, leveraging ViTs' ability
to understand overall shapes and contrastive learning's effectiveness,
overcomes the need for extensive labeled data and the limitations of CNNs in
capturing crucial shape relationships. The success stems from capturing global
shape semantics via ViTs and refining local discriminative features through
contrastive optimization. Importantly, our approach is empirical, as it is
grounded on extensive experimental evaluation to validate the effectiveness of
combining ViTs with contrastive objectives for 3D representation learning.

### [3] [FutrTrack: A Camera-LiDAR Fusion Transformer for 3D Multiple Object Tracking](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19981)
*Martha Teiko Teye,Ori Maoz,Matthias Rottmann*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FutrTrack是一个基于transformer的相机-LiDAR多目标跟踪框架，通过两阶段transformer精炼和跟踪流程，结合BEV融合特征，在nuScenes和KITTI数据集上取得优异性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的3D跟踪方法主要依赖单一传感器，缺乏多模态融合带来的鲁棒性。作者旨在开发一个无需显式运动模型的多模态跟踪框架，提升在遮挡和视角变化下的跟踪稳定性。

Method: 1. 基于现有3D检测器构建模块化框架；2. 引入transformer-based smoother进行轨迹平滑；3. 使用融合驱动的tracker，结合边界框和多模态BEV特征；4. 两阶段transformer精炼和跟踪流程，无需显式运动模型。

Result: 在nuScenes测试集上达到74.7 aMOTA，在3D MOT基准测试中表现优异，显著减少身份切换，同时保持竞争性精度。相比单传感器方法，多模态特征带来显著性能提升。

Conclusion: FutrTrack证明了基于查询的transformer跟踪方法能从多模态传感器特征中显著受益，提供了一个无需预训练和有限数据下仍能与其他神经网络方法竞争的框架。

Abstract: We propose FutrTrack, a modular camera-LiDAR multi-object tracking framework
that builds on existing 3D detectors by introducing a transformer-based
smoother and a fusion-driven tracker. Inspired by query-based tracking
frameworks, FutrTrack employs a multimodal two-stage transformer refinement and
tracking pipeline. Our fusion tracker integrates bounding boxes with multimodal
bird's-eye-view (BEV) fusion features from multiple cameras and LiDAR without
the need for an explicit motion model. The tracker assigns and propagates
identities across frames, leveraging both geometric and semantic cues for
robust re-identification under occlusion and viewpoint changes. Prior to
tracking, we refine sequences of bounding boxes with a temporal smoother over a
moving window to refine trajectories, reduce jitter, and improve spatial
consistency. Evaluated on nuScenes and KITTI, FutrTrack demonstrates that
query-based transformer tracking methods benefit significantly from multimodal
sensor features compared with previous single-sensor approaches. With an aMOTA
of 74.7 on the nuScenes test set, FutrTrack achieves strong performance on 3D
MOT benchmarks, reducing identity switches while maintaining competitive
accuracy. Our approach provides an efficient framework for improving
transformer-based trackers to compete with other neural-network-based methods
even with limited data and without pretraining.

### [4] [Improving Predictive Confidence in Medical Imaging via Online Label Smoothing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20011)
*Kushan Choudhury,Shubhrodeep Roy,Ankur Chanda,Shubhajit Biswas,Somenath Kuiry*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 在线标签平滑(OLS)在医学图像分类中通过动态调整软标签来减少模型过度自信，相比传统方法提升了分类准确率和特征表示质量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 深度学习模型在医学图像分类中常产生过度自信的预测，影响医疗环境中的可靠性。传统标签平滑方法未能考虑类别间关系，需要更智能的解决方案。

Method: 使用在线标签平滑(OLS)方法，在训练过程中基于模型自身预测模式动态调整软标签。在RadImageNet数据集上评估了ResNet-50、MobileNetV2和VGG-19三种架构。

Result: OLS相比硬标签、传统标签平滑和无教师知识蒸馏等方法，持续提升了Top-1和Top-5分类准确率，并产生了更紧凑、分离度更好的特征嵌入。

Conclusion: OLS不仅增强了预测性能，还改善了校准效果，是医学影像领域开发可信AI系统的实用有效解决方案。

Abstract: Deep learning models, especially convolutional neural networks, have achieved
impressive results in medical image classification. However, these models often
produce overconfident predictions, which can undermine their reliability in
critical healthcare settings. While traditional label smoothing offers a simple
way to reduce such overconfidence, it fails to consider relationships between
classes by treating all non-target classes equally. In this study, we explore
the use of Online Label Smoothing (OLS), a dynamic approach that adjusts soft
labels throughout training based on the model's own prediction patterns. We
evaluate OLS on the large-scale RadImageNet dataset using three widely used
architectures: ResNet-50, MobileNetV2, and VGG-19. Our results show that OLS
consistently improves both Top-1 and Top-5 classification accuracy compared to
standard training methods, including hard labels, conventional label smoothing,
and teacher-free knowledge distillation. In addition to accuracy gains, OLS
leads to more compact and well-separated feature embeddings, indicating
improved representation learning. These findings suggest that OLS not only
strengthens predictive performance but also enhances calibration, making it a
practical and effective solution for developing trustworthy AI systems in the
medical imaging domain.

### [5] [A Unified Detection Pipeline for Robust Object Detection in Fisheye-Based Traffic Surveillance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20016)
*Neema Jakisa Owor,Joshua Kofi Asamoah,Tanner Wambui Muturi,Anneliese Jakisa Owor,Blessing Agyei Kyem,Andrews Danyo,Yaw Adu-Gyamfi,Armstrong Aboah*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种针对鱼眼相机交通监控的检测框架，通过预处理和后处理管道提升在严重畸变区域的检测一致性，使用集成策略结合多个先进检测模型，在AI City Challenge Track 4中获得第8名。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 鱼眼相机在广域交通监控中具有优势，但其强径向畸变和非均匀分辨率给标准目标检测器带来挑战，特别是在图像边界区域物体外观严重退化时。

Method: 采用简单有效的预处理和后处理管道，在鱼眼交通图像上训练多个先进检测模型，并通过集成策略结合它们的输出以提高整体检测精度。

Result: 在2025 AI City Challenge Track 4中获得了0.6366的F1分数，在62个团队中排名第8。

Conclusion: 该框架有效解决了鱼眼图像固有的问题，证明了其在处理鱼眼图像畸变方面的有效性。

Abstract: Fisheye cameras offer an efficient solution for wide-area traffic
surveillance by capturing large fields of view from a single vantage point.
However, the strong radial distortion and nonuniform resolution inherent in
fisheye imagery introduce substantial challenges for standard object detectors,
particularly near image boundaries where object appearance is severely
degraded. In this work, we present a detection framework designed to operate
robustly under these conditions. Our approach employs a simple yet effective
pre and post processing pipeline that enhances detection consistency across the
image, especially in regions affected by severe distortion. We train several
state-of-the-art detection models on the fisheye traffic imagery and combine
their outputs through an ensemble strategy to improve overall detection
accuracy. Our method achieves an F1 score of0.6366 on the 2025 AI City
Challenge Track 4, placing 8thoverall out of 62 teams. These results
demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework in addressing issues inherent to
fisheye imagery.

### [6] [Extreme Views: 3DGS Filter for Novel View Synthesis from Out-of-Distribution Camera Poses](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20027)
*Damian Bowness,Charalambos Poullis*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种实时渲染感知过滤方法，通过中间梯度计算敏感度分数，解决3D高斯泼溅模型在训练数据分布外视角渲染时的视觉噪声问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 3D高斯泼溅模型在训练数据分布外的视角渲染时会出现严重的视觉噪声，这是由于缺乏这些外推区域的训练数据，导致密度、颜色和几何预测的不确定性。

Method: 利用中间梯度计算敏感度分数，专门针对各向异性方向引起的不稳定性进行过滤，而不是各向同性方差。该方法直接处理生成不确定性的核心问题。

Result: 实验评估表明，与现有的基于神经辐射场的方法（如BayesRays）相比，该方法显著提高了视觉质量、真实感和一致性。

Conclusion: 该过滤方法能够实时无缝集成到现有的3DGS渲染流水线中，无需进行大量的后训练或微调，使3D重建系统在用户自由导航到原始训练视角之外时仍能保持高视觉保真度。

Abstract: When viewing a 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) model from camera positions
significantly outside the training data distribution, substantial visual noise
commonly occurs. These artifacts result from the lack of training data in these
extrapolated regions, leading to uncertain density, color, and geometry
predictions from the model.
  To address this issue, we propose a novel real-time render-aware filtering
method. Our approach leverages sensitivity scores derived from intermediate
gradients, explicitly targeting instabilities caused by anisotropic
orientations rather than isotropic variance. This filtering method directly
addresses the core issue of generative uncertainty, allowing 3D reconstruction
systems to maintain high visual fidelity even when users freely navigate
outside the original training viewpoints.
  Experimental evaluation demonstrates that our method substantially improves
visual quality, realism, and consistency compared to existing Neural Radiance
Field (NeRF)-based approaches such as BayesRays. Critically, our filter
seamlessly integrates into existing 3DGS rendering pipelines in real-time,
unlike methods that require extensive post-hoc retraining or fine-tuning.

### [7] [BrainPuzzle: Hybrid Physics and Data-Driven Reconstruction for Transcranial Ultrasound Tomography](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20029)
*Shengyu Chen,Shihang Feng,Yi Luo,Xiaowei Jia,Youzuo Lin*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出BrainPuzzle混合框架，结合物理建模与机器学习，通过两阶段方法解决经颅超声脑成像中声速重建的挑战，在低信噪比和稀疏孔径条件下实现准确的定量声速成像。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决传统物理全波形反演方法因颅骨引起的信号衰减、模式转换和相位畸变导致的弱信号问题，以及数据驱动方法在复杂非线性波传播建模中的定量偏差问题。

Method: 两阶段混合框架：第一阶段使用逆时偏移（时间反转声学）从多角度采集生成保留结构细节的偏移片段；第二阶段使用基于transformer的超分辨率编码器-解码器与图注意力单元融合片段为连贯的声速图像。采用可移动低计数换能器的部分阵列采集策略。

Result: 在两个合成数据集上的实验表明，BrainPuzzle在声速重建精度和图像完整性方面优于其他方法，展示了其在推进定量超声脑成像方面的潜力。

Conclusion: BrainPuzzle框架成功结合了物理建模和机器学习的优势，在具有挑战性的经颅超声脑成像条件下实现了准确和定量的声速重建，为临床可行的定量超声脑成像提供了有前景的解决方案。

Abstract: Ultrasound brain imaging remains challenging due to the large difference in
sound speed between the skull and brain tissues and the difficulty of coupling
large probes to the skull. This work aims to achieve quantitative transcranial
ultrasound by reconstructing an accurate speed-of-sound (SoS) map of the brain.
Traditional physics-based full-waveform inversion (FWI) is limited by weak
signals caused by skull-induced attenuation, mode conversion, and phase
aberration, as well as incomplete spatial coverage since full-aperture arrays
are clinically impractical. In contrast, purely data-driven methods that learn
directly from raw ultrasound data often fail to model the complex nonlinear and
nonlocal wave propagation through bone, leading to anatomically plausible but
quantitatively biased SoS maps under low signal-to-noise and sparse-aperture
conditions. To address these issues, we propose BrainPuzzle, a hybrid two-stage
framework that combines physical modeling with machine learning. In the first
stage, reverse time migration (time-reversal acoustics) is applied to
multi-angle acquisitions to produce migration fragments that preserve
structural details even under low SNR. In the second stage, a transformer-based
super-resolution encoder-decoder with a graph-based attention unit (GAU) fuses
these fragments into a coherent and quantitatively accurate SoS image. A
partial-array acquisition strategy using a movable low-count transducer set
improves feasibility and coupling, while the hybrid algorithm compensates for
the missing aperture. Experiments on two synthetic datasets show that
BrainPuzzle achieves superior SoS reconstruction accuracy and image
completeness, demonstrating its potential for advancing quantitative ultrasound
brain imaging.

### [8] [Exposing Blindspots: Cultural Bias Evaluation in Generative Image Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20042)
*Huichan Seo,Sieun Choi,Minki Hong,Yi Zhou,Junseo Kim,Lukman Ismaila,Naome Etori,Mehul Agarwal,Zhixuan Liu,Jihie Kim,Jean Oh*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该研究开发了一个统一评估框架，用于诊断生成式图像模型中的文化偏见，涵盖文本到图像生成和图像到图像编辑，发现在国家无关提示下模型偏向全球北方现代描绘，迭代编辑会侵蚀文化保真度，当前系统无法可靠进行文化敏感编辑。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注文本到图像系统的文化偏见，而图像到图像编辑器的文化偏见研究不足，需要建立一个标准化协议来比较诊断不同模型的文化表现。

Method: 使用开放模型和固定设置，在六个国家进行跨国家、跨时代、跨类别评估，结合标准自动指标、文化感知检索增强VQA和本地评审专家的专业判断。

Result: 发现三个主要结果：模型默认全球北方现代描绘、迭代编辑侵蚀文化保真度、图像到图像模型仅应用表面线索而非上下文感知变化。

Conclusion: 当前系统无法可靠进行文化敏感编辑，通过发布标准化数据、提示和评估协议，为诊断和跟踪生成式图像模型中的文化偏见提供了可复现的文化中心基准。

Abstract: Generative image models produce striking visuals yet often misrepresent
culture. Prior work has examined cultural bias mainly in text-to-image (T2I)
systems, leaving image-to-image (I2I) editors underexplored. We bridge this gap
with a unified evaluation across six countries, an 8-category/36-subcategory
schema, and era-aware prompts, auditing both T2I generation and I2I editing
under a standardized protocol that yields comparable diagnostics. Using open
models with fixed settings, we derive cross-country, cross-era, and
cross-category evaluations. Our framework combines standard automatic metrics,
a culture-aware retrieval-augmented VQA, and expert human judgments collected
from native reviewers. To enable reproducibility, we release the complete image
corpus, prompts, and configurations. Our study reveals three findings: (1)
under country-agnostic prompts, models default to Global-North, modern-leaning
depictions that flatten cross-country distinctions; (2) iterative I2I editing
erodes cultural fidelity even when conventional metrics remain flat or improve;
and (3) I2I models apply superficial cues (palette shifts, generic props)
rather than era-consistent, context-aware changes, often retaining source
identity for Global-South targets. These results highlight that
culture-sensitive edits remain unreliable in current systems. By releasing
standardized data, prompts, and human evaluation protocols, we provide a
reproducible, culture-centered benchmark for diagnosing and tracking cultural
bias in generative image models.

### [9] [Filter-Based Reconstruction of Images from Events](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20071)
*Bernd Pfrommer*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出FIBAR方法，一种基于滤波器的异步图像重建方法，用于从事件相机的事件流重建强度图像，相比神经网络方法更简单且能在CPU上高效运行


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的事件相机图像重建方法通常依赖GPU上的神经网络，计算复杂且昂贵。需要一种更简单、高效的异步重建方法

Method: 使用时间数字IIR滤波器整合事件信号强度变化，通过新颖算法检测陈旧像素并调节更新窗口，对陈旧像素应用高斯滤波以减少噪声

Result: FIBAR在笔记本电脑CPU上处理速度达4200万-1.4亿事件/秒，重建图像比神经网络方法噪声更大且有重影，但足以完成某些任务如检测基准标记

Conclusion: FIBAR提供了一种简单高效的异步图像重建替代方案，虽然重建质量不如神经网络方法，但在某些应用场景下已足够使用

Abstract: Reconstructing an intensity image from the events of a moving event camera is
a challenging task that is typically approached with neural networks deployed
on graphics processing units. This paper presents a much simpler, FIlter Based
Asynchronous Reconstruction method (FIBAR). First, intensity changes signaled
by events are integrated with a temporal digital IIR filter. To reduce
reconstruction noise, stale pixels are detected by a novel algorithm that
regulates a window of recently updated pixels. Arguing that for a moving
camera, the absence of events at a pixel location likely implies a low image
gradient, stale pixels are then blurred with a Gaussian filter. In contrast to
most existing methods, FIBAR is asynchronous and permits image read-out at an
arbitrary time. It runs on a modern laptop CPU at about 42(140) million
events/s with (without) spatial filtering enabled. A few simple qualitative
experiments are presented that show the difference in image reconstruction
between FIBAR and a neural network-based approach (FireNet). FIBAR's
reconstruction is noisier than neural network-based methods and suffers from
ghost images. However, it is sufficient for certain tasks such as the detection
of fiducial markers. Code is available at

*Hui Chen,Xinjie Wang,Xianchao Xiu,Wanquan Liu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新型的变换双边张量低秩表示模型TBTLRR，通过自适应张量核范数和双边结构，有效处理图像聚类中的噪声问题，在聚类性能上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有张量低秩表示方法依赖固定变换，对噪声鲁棒性差，需要开发能更好捕捉全局和局部相关性、处理复杂噪声的自适应方法。

Method: TBTLRR模型引入数据自适应的张量核范数，学习任意酉变换来捕捉全局相关性；利用双边结构挖掘图像样本和特征间的局部相关性；集成ℓ1/2范数和Frobenius范数正则化处理复杂噪声；基于ADMM开发高效优化算法。

Result: 大量实验验证了TBTLRR在聚类任务上的优越性，显著优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: TBTLRR通过自适应变换和双边结构，在图像聚类中实现了更好的噪声鲁棒性和聚类性能，为张量低秩表示提供了新的有效解决方案。

Abstract: Tensor low-rank representation (TLRR) has demonstrated significant success in
image clustering. However, most existing methods rely on fixed transformations
and suffer from poor robustness to noise. In this paper, we propose a novel
transformed bilateral tensor low-rank representation model called TBTLRR, which
introduces a data-adaptive tensor nuclear norm by learning arbitrary unitary
transforms, allowing for more effective capture of global correlations. In
addition, by leveraging the bilateral structure of latent tensor data, TBTLRR
is able to exploit local correlations between image samples and features.
Furthermore, TBTLRR integrates the $\ell_{1/2}$-norm and Frobenius norm
regularization terms for better dealing with complex noise in real-world
scenarios. To solve the proposed nonconvex model, we develop an efficient
optimization algorithm inspired by the alternating direction method of
multipliers (ADMM) and provide theoretical convergence. Extensive experiments
validate its superiority over the state-of-the-art methods in clustering. The
code will be available at https://github.com/xianchaoxiu/TBTLRR.

TL;DR: Endoshare是一个开源跨平台应用，用于合并、标准化和去识别化内窥镜手术视频，解决视频格式异构和隐私问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 视频评估和外科数据科学可推动外科培训、研究和质量改进，但受限于异构记录格式和视频共享的隐私担忧。

Method: 采用软件开发生命周期，基于用户反馈迭代开发。分析阶段通过内部调查确定隐私设计架构，测试阶段结合可用性启发式和TAM模型评估。

Result: 原型测试显示高可用性（4.68±0.40/5），改进后外科医生报告高感知有用性（5.07±1.75/7）、易用性（5.15±1.71/7）和强推荐（9.20±0.79/10）。处理时间受处理模式、视频时长和机器性能影响。

Conclusion: Endoshare提供了透明、用户友好的标准化隐私保护手术视频管理流程，需要合规认证和更广泛互操作性验证才能成为专有系统的可部署替代方案。

Abstract: Video-based assessment and surgical data science can advance surgical
training, research, and quality improvement. However, widespread use remains
limited by heterogeneous recording formats and privacy concerns associated with
video sharing. We present Endoshare, a source-available, cross-platform
application for merging, standardizing, and de-identifying endoscopic videos in
minimally invasive surgery. Development followed the software development life
cycle with iterative, user-centered feedback. During the analysis phase, an
internal survey of clinicians and computer scientists based on ten usability
heuristics identified key requirements that guided a privacy-by-design
architecture. In the testing phase, an external clinician survey combined the
same heuristics with Technology Acceptance Model constructs to assess usability
and adoption, complemented by benchmarking across different hardware
configurations. Four clinicians and four computer scientists initially tested
the prototype, reporting high usability (4.68 +/- 0.40/5 and 4.03 +/- 0.51/5),
with the lowest score (4.00 +/- 0.93/5) relating to label clarity. After
refinement, the testing phase surveyed ten surgeons who reported high perceived
usefulness (5.07 +/- 1.75/7), ease of use (5.15 +/- 1.71/7), heuristic
usability (4.38 +/- 0.48/5), and strong recommendation (9.20 +/- 0.79/10).
Processing time varied with processing mode, video duration (both p <= 0.001),
and machine computational power (p = 0.041). Endoshare provides a transparent,
user-friendly pipeline for standardized, privacy-preserving surgical video
management. Compliance certification and broader interoperability validation
are needed to establish it as a deployable alternative to proprietary systems.

### [12] [Attentive Convolution: Unifying the Expressivity of Self-Attention with Convolutional Efficiency](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20092)
*Hao Yu,Haoyu Chen,Yan Jiang,Wei Peng,Zhaodong Sun,Samuel Kaski,Guoying Zhao*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文提出了注意力卷积(ATConv)，通过将自注意力机制的两个关键特性（自适应路由和侧向抑制）注入到卷积操作中，解决了传统卷积与自注意力之间的性能差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自注意力机制虽然表达能力强但计算复杂度高，而卷积计算效率高但性能存在差距。研究旨在探索自注意力优于卷积的根本原因，并设计兼具两者优势的新算子。

Method: 通过分析发现自注意力的两个关键特性：自适应路由（根据语义内容动态调节位置信息流）和侧向抑制（通过得分竞争抑制冗余）。基于此设计了ATConv，将这两个原则注入到卷积操作中。

Result: ATConv在基础视觉任务中持续优于各种自注意力机制。基于ATConv构建的AttNet在ImageNet-1K上达到84.4%的Top-1准确率（仅27M参数）。在扩散模型中，用ATConv替换所有自注意力可将FID降低0.15，且采样更快。

Conclusion: ATConv成功将自注意力的核心优势融入卷积框架，在保持线性复杂度的同时达到了超越自注意力的性能，为视觉骨干网络设计提供了新的方向。

Abstract: Self-attention (SA) has become the cornerstone of modern vision backbones for
its powerful expressivity over traditional Convolutions (Conv). However, its
quadratic complexity remains a critical bottleneck for practical applications.
Given that Conv offers linear complexity and strong visual priors, continuing
efforts have been made to promote the renaissance of Conv. However, a
persistent performance chasm remains, highlighting that these modernizations
have not yet captured the intrinsic expressivity that defines SA. In this
paper, we re-examine the design of the CNNs, directed by a key question: what
principles give SA its edge over Conv? As a result, we reveal two fundamental
insights that challenge the long-standing design intuitions in prior research
(e.g., Receptive field). The two findings are: (1) \textit{Adaptive routing}:
SA dynamically regulates positional information flow according to semantic
content, whereas Conv employs static kernels uniformly across all positions.
(2) \textit{Lateral inhibition}: SA induces score competition among token
weighting, effectively suppressing redundancy and sharpening representations,
whereas Conv filters lack such inhibitory dynamics and exhibit considerable
redundancy. Based on this, we propose \textit{Attentive Convolution} (ATConv),
a principled reformulation of the convolutional operator that intrinsically
injects these principles. Interestingly, with only $3\times3$ kernels, ATConv
consistently outperforms various SA mechanisms in fundamental vision tasks.
Building on ATConv, we introduce AttNet, a CNN family that can attain
\textbf{84.4\%} ImageNet-1K Top-1 accuracy with only 27M parameters. In
diffusion-based image generation, replacing all SA with the proposed $3\times
3$ ATConv in SiT-XL/2 reduces ImageNet FID by 0.15 in 400k steps with faster
sampling. Code is available at: github.com/price112/Attentive-Convolution.

Result: 相比Stable Diffusion基线，StableSketcher生成的草图具有更好的风格保真度和提示对齐度。

Conclusion: StableSketcher框架有效提升了手绘草图的生成质量，同时发布了首个实例级草图数据集SketchDUO。

Abstract: Although recent advancements in diffusion models have significantly enriched
the quality of generated images, challenges remain in synthesizing pixel-based
human-drawn sketches, a representative example of abstract expression. To
combat these challenges, we propose StableSketcher, a novel framework that
empowers diffusion models to generate hand-drawn sketches with high prompt
fidelity. Within this framework, we fine-tune the variational autoencoder to
optimize latent decoding, enabling it to better capture the characteristics of
sketches. In parallel, we integrate a new reward function for reinforcement
learning based on visual question answering, which improves text-image
alignment and semantic consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that
StableSketcher generates sketches with improved stylistic fidelity, achieving
better alignment with prompts compared to the Stable Diffusion baseline.
Additionally, we introduce SketchDUO, to the best of our knowledge, the first
dataset comprising instance-level sketches paired with captions and
question-answer pairs, thereby addressing the limitations of existing datasets
that rely on image-label pairs. Our code and dataset will be made publicly
available upon acceptance.

Motivation: 生物学领域相比其他科学领域缺乏大规模、忠实且实例特定的标题数据，这限制了自然语言监督在生物多模态基础模型中的应用。

Method: 使用多模态大语言模型生成合成标题，结合维基百科的视觉信息和特定分类群的格式示例，训练BIOCAP生物基础模型。

Result: BIOCAP模型能够捕捉丰富的语义信息，在物种分类和文本-图像检索任务中表现优异。

Conclusion: 描述性标题超越了传统标签的价值，能够有效桥接生物图像与多模态基础模型。

Abstract: This work investigates descriptive captions as an additional source of
supervision for biological multimodal foundation models. Images and captions
can be viewed as complementary samples from the latent morphospace of a
species, each capturing certain biological traits. Incorporating captions
during training encourages alignment with this shared latent structure,
emphasizing potentially diagnostic characters while suppressing spurious
correlations. The main challenge, however, lies in obtaining faithful,
instance-specific captions at scale. This requirement has limited the
utilization of natural language supervision in organismal biology compared with
many other scientific domains. We complement this gap by generating synthetic
captions with multimodal large language models (MLLMs), guided by
Wikipedia-derived visual information and taxon-tailored format examples. These
domain-specific contexts help reduce hallucination and yield accurate,
instance-based descriptive captions. Using these captions, we train BIOCAP
(i.e., BIOCLIP with Captions), a biological foundation model that captures rich
semantics and achieves strong performance in species classification and
text-image retrieval. These results demonstrate the value of descriptive
captions beyond labels in bridging biological images with multimodal foundation
models.

Abstract: While computer vision has advanced considerably for general object detection
and tracking, the specific problem of fast-moving tiny objects remains
underexplored. This paper addresses the significant challenge of detecting and
tracking rapidly moving small objects using an RGB-D camera. Our novel system
combines deep learning-based detection with physics-based tracking to overcome
the limitations of existing approaches. Our contributions include: (1) a
comprehensive system design for object detection and tracking of fast-moving
small objects in 3D space, (2) an innovative physics-based tracking algorithm
that integrates kinematics motion equations to handle outliers and missed
detections, and (3) an outlier detection and correction module that
significantly improves tracking performance in challenging scenarios such as
occlusions and rapid direction changes. We evaluated our proposed system on a
custom racquetball dataset. Our evaluation shows our system surpassing kalman
filter based trackers with up to 70\% less Average Displacement Error. Our
system has significant applications for improving robot perception on
autonomous platforms and demonstrates the effectiveness of combining
physics-based models with deep learning approaches for real-time 3D detection
and tracking of challenging small objects.

Abstract: A concept of light-fields computed from multiple view images on regular grids
has proven its benefit for scene representations, and supported realistic
renderings of novel views and photographic effects such as refocusing and
shallow depth of field. In spite of its effectiveness of light flow
computations, obtaining light fields requires either computational costs or
specialized devices like a bulky camera setup and a specialized microlens
array. In an effort to broaden its benefit and applicability, in this paper, we
propose a novel view synthesis method for light field generation from only
single images, named inverse image-based rendering. Unlike previous attempts to
implicitly rebuild 3D geometry or to explicitly represent objective scenes, our
method reconstructs light flows in a space from image pixels, which behaves in
the opposite way to image-based rendering. To accomplish this, we design a
neural rendering pipeline to render a target ray in an arbitrary viewpoint. Our
neural renderer first stores the light flow of source rays from the input
image, then computes the relationships among them through cross-attention, and
finally predicts the color of the target ray based on these relationships.
After the rendering pipeline generates the first novel view from a single input
image, the generated out-of-view contents are updated to the set of source
rays. This procedure is iteratively performed while ensuring the consistent
generation of occluded contents. We demonstrate that our inverse image-based
rendering works well with various challenging datasets without any retraining
or finetuning after once trained on synthetic dataset, and outperforms relevant
state-of-the-art novel view synthesis methods.

Motivation: 现有后处理方法未能充分利用模型logit空间中的丰富信息，需要更有效地利用logit关系来提升OOD检测性能

Method: 提出LogitGap方法，利用最大logit与剩余logit的关系，并引入无训练策略自动识别最信息丰富的logit子集进行评分

Result: 在视觉语言和纯视觉模型上的广泛实验表明，LogitGap在各种OOD检测场景和基准测试中始终达到最先进性能

Conclusion: LogitGap通过有效利用logit空间中的关系信息，为OOD检测提供了一种高效且性能优异的后处理方法

Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is critical for ensuring the reliability
of deep learning models in open-world applications. While post-hoc methods are
favored for their efficiency and ease of deployment, existing approaches often
underexploit the rich information embedded in the model's logits space. In this
paper, we propose LogitGap, a novel post-hoc OOD detection method that
explicitly exploits the relationship between the maximum logit and the
remaining logits to enhance the separability between in-distribution (ID) and
OOD samples. To further improve its effectiveness, we refine LogitGap by
focusing on a more compact and informative subset of the logit space.
Specifically, we introduce a training-free strategy that automatically
identifies the most informative logits for scoring. We provide both theoretical
analysis and empirical evidence to validate the effectiveness of our approach.
Extensive experiments on both vision-language and vision-only models
demonstrate that LogitGap consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance
across diverse OOD detection scenarios and benchmarks. Code is available at

Conclusion: PartNeXt通过可扩展标注、纹理感知标签和多任务评估，为结构化3D理解研究开辟了新途径。

Abstract: Understanding objects at the level of their constituent parts is fundamental
to advancing computer vision, graphics, and robotics. While datasets like
PartNet have driven progress in 3D part understanding, their reliance on
untextured geometries and expert-dependent annotation limits scalability and
usability. We introduce PartNeXt, a next-generation dataset addressing these
gaps with over 23,000 high-quality, textured 3D models annotated with
fine-grained, hierarchical part labels across 50 categories. We benchmark
PartNeXt on two tasks: (1) class-agnostic part segmentation, where
state-of-the-art methods (e.g., PartField, SAMPart3D) struggle with
fine-grained and leaf-level parts, and (2) 3D part-centric question answering,
a new benchmark for 3D-LLMs that reveals significant gaps in open-vocabulary
part grounding. Additionally, training Point-SAM on PartNeXt yields substantial
gains over PartNet, underscoring the dataset's superior quality and diversity.
By combining scalable annotation, texture-aware labels, and multi-task
evaluation, PartNeXt opens new avenues for research in structured 3D
understanding.

Motivation: 在自动驾驶中，自行车手属于易受伤害道路使用者，准确估计其姿态对于意图分类、行为预测和碰撞避免至关重要。传统6D姿态估计方法无法处理自行车铰接结构的变化，因为车把和踏板的角度变化会影响3D边界框和实际行驶方向。

Method: 提出类别级8D姿态估计方法，联合估计8D姿态和3D关键点，使用合成和真实图像数据进行混合训练，以在真实图像上实现泛化。

Result: 方法在8D姿态参数估计精度方面表现出色，与使用刚性规范对象模板匹配的最先进6D姿态估计器相比取得了有竞争力的分数。

Conclusion: 该方法能够估计更细粒度的自行车姿态状态和行驶方向，为自动驾驶系统中的自行车行为理解和安全决策提供了更准确的姿态信息。

Abstract: In Autonomous Driving, cyclists belong to the safety-critical class of
Vulnerable Road Users (VRU), and accurate estimation of their pose is critical
for cyclist crossing intention classification, behavior prediction, and
collision avoidance. Unlike rigid objects, articulated bicycles are composed of
movable rigid parts linked by joints and constrained by a kinematic structure.
6D pose methods can estimate the 3D rotation and translation of rigid bicycles,
but 6D becomes insufficient when the steering/pedals angles of the bicycle
vary. That is because: 1) varying the articulated pose of the bicycle causes
its 3D bounding box to vary as well, and 2) the 3D box orientation is not
necessarily aligned to the orientation of the steering which determines the
actual intended travel direction. In this work, we introduce a method for
category-level 8D pose estimation for articulated bicycles and cyclists from a
single RGB image. Besides being able to estimate the 3D translation and
rotation of a bicycle from a single image, our method also estimates the
rotations of its steering handles and pedals with respect to the bicycle body
frame. These two new parameters enable the estimation of a more fine-grained
bicycle pose state and travel direction. Our proposed model jointly estimates
the 8D pose and the 3D Keypoints of articulated bicycles, and trains with a mix
of synthetic and real image data to generalize on real images. We include an
evaluation section where we evaluate the accuracy of our estimated 8D pose
parameters, and our method shows promising results by achieving competitive
scores when compared against state-of-the-art category-level 6D pose estimators
that use rigid canonical object templates for matching.

Conclusion: TOMCAT方法能有效适应测试时的分布偏移，在组合零样本学习任务中表现出色。

Abstract: Compositional Zero-Shot Learning (CZSL) aims to recognize novel
attribute-object compositions based on the knowledge learned from seen ones.
Existing methods suffer from performance degradation caused by the distribution
shift of label space at test time, which stems from the inclusion of unseen
compositions recombined from attributes and objects. To overcome the challenge,
we propose a novel approach that accumulates comprehensive knowledge in both
textual and visual modalities from unsupervised data to update multimodal
prototypes at test time. Building on this, we further design an adaptive update
weight to control the degree of prototype adjustment, enabling the model to
flexibly adapt to distribution shift during testing. Moreover, a dynamic
priority queue is introduced that stores high-confidence images to acquire
visual knowledge from historical images for inference. Considering the semantic
consistency of multimodal knowledge, we align textual and visual prototypes by
multimodal collaborative representation learning. Extensive experiments
indicate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance on four
benchmark datasets under both closed-world and open-world settings. Code will
be available at https://github.com/xud-yan/TOMCAT .

Result: 在dSprites和Color-dSprites数据集上达到与最先进β-VAE相当的解耦分数，优于InfoGAN；在CelebA和3D Chairs数据集上，生成样本的视觉质量和多样性在FID得分上优于β-VAE和InfoGAN。

Conclusion: IB-GAN通过信息瓶颈框架有效实现了GAN的解耦表示学习，在解耦性能和生成质量方面均优于现有方法。

Abstract: We propose a new GAN-based unsupervised model for disentangled representation
learning. The new model is discovered in an attempt to utilize the Information
Bottleneck (IB) framework to the optimization of GAN, thereby named IB-GAN. The
architecture of IB-GAN is partially similar to that of InfoGAN but has a
critical difference; an intermediate layer of the generator is leveraged to
constrain the mutual information between the input and the generated output.
The intermediate stochastic layer can serve as a learnable latent distribution
that is trained with the generator jointly in an end-to-end fashion. As a
result, the generator of IB-GAN can harness the latent space in a disentangled
and interpretable manner. With the experiments on dSprites and Color-dSprites
dataset, we demonstrate that IB-GAN achieves competitive disentanglement scores
to those of state-of-the-art \b{eta}-VAEs and outperforms InfoGAN. Moreover,
the visual quality and the diversity of samples generated by IB-GAN are often
better than those by \b{eta}-VAEs and Info-GAN in terms of FID score on CelebA

Conclusion: PPMStereo通过两阶段协作过程实现了高效的长距离时空一致性建模，在精度和时间一致性方面均达到最先进水平。

Abstract: Temporally consistent depth estimation from stereo video is critical for
real-world applications such as augmented reality, where inconsistent depth
estimation disrupts the immersion of users. Despite its importance, this task
remains challenging due to the difficulty in modeling long-term temporal
consistency in a computationally efficient manner. Previous methods attempt to
address this by aggregating spatio-temporal information but face a fundamental
trade-off: limited temporal modeling provides only modest gains, whereas
capturing long-range dependencies significantly increases computational cost.
To address this limitation, we introduce a memory buffer for modeling
long-range spatio-temporal consistency while achieving efficient dynamic stereo
matching. Inspired by the two-stage decision-making process in humans, we
propose a \textbf{P}ick-and-\textbf{P}lay \textbf{M}emory (PPM) construction
module for dynamic \textbf{Stereo} matching, dubbed as \textbf{PPMStereo}. PPM
consists of a `pick' process that identifies the most relevant frames and a
`play' process that weights the selected frames adaptively for spatio-temporal
aggregation. This two-stage collaborative process maintains a compact yet
highly informative memory buffer while achieving temporally consistent
information aggregation. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of
PPMStereo, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance in both accuracy and
temporal consistency. % Notably, PPMStereo achieves 0.62/1.11 TEPE on the
Sintel clean/final (17.3\% \& 9.02\% improvements over BiDAStereo) with fewer
computational costs. Codes are available at

Abstract: Large-scale video generation models have demonstrated high visual realism in
diverse contexts, spurring interest in their potential as general-purpose world
simulators. Existing benchmarks focus on individual subjects rather than scenes
with multiple interacting people. However, the plausibility of multi-agent
dynamics in generated videos remains unverified. We propose a rigorous
evaluation protocol to benchmark text-to-video (T2V) and image-to-video (I2V)
models as implicit simulators of pedestrian dynamics. For I2V, we leverage
start frames from established datasets to enable comparison with a ground truth
video dataset. For T2V, we develop a prompt suite to explore diverse pedestrian
densities and interactions. A key component is a method to reconstruct 2D
bird's-eye view trajectories from pixel-space without known camera parameters.
Our analysis reveals that leading models have learned surprisingly effective
priors for plausible multi-agent behavior. However, failure modes like merging
and disappearing people highlight areas for future improvement.

Abstract: Temporal Intention Localization (TIL) is crucial for video surveillance,
focusing on identifying varying levels of suspicious intentions to improve
security monitoring. However, existing discrete classification methods fail to
capture the continuous nature of suspicious intentions, limiting early
intervention and explainability. In this paper, we propose the Suspicion
Progression Analysis Network (SPAN), which shifts from discrete classification
to continuous regression, enabling the capture of fluctuating and evolving
suspicious intentions. We reveal that suspicion exhibits long-term dependencies
and cumulative effects, similar to Temporal Point Process (TPP) theory. Based
on these insights, we define a suspicion score formula that models continuous
changes while accounting for temporal characteristics. We also introduce
Suspicion Coefficient Modulation, which adjusts suspicion coefficients using
multimodal information to reflect the varying impacts of suspicious actions.
Additionally, the Concept-Anchored Mapping method is proposed to link
suspicious actions to predefined intention concepts, offering insights into
both the actions and their potential underlying intentions. Extensive
experiments on the HAI dataset show that SPAN significantly outperforms
existing methods, reducing MSE by 19.8% and improving average mAP by 1.78%.
Notably, SPAN achieves a 2.74% mAP gain in low-frequency cases, demonstrating
its superior ability to capture subtle behavioral changes. Compared to discrete
classification systems, our continuous suspicion modeling approach enables
earlier detection and proactive intervention, greatly enhancing system
explainability and practical utility in security applications.

Abstract: The development of foundation models for brain MRI depends critically on the
scale, diversity, and consistency of available data, yet systematic assessments
of these factors remain scarce. In this study, we analyze 54 publicly
accessible brain MRI datasets encompassing over 538,031 to provide a
structured, multi-level overview tailored to foundation model development. At
the dataset level, we characterize modality composition, disease coverage, and
dataset scale, revealing strong imbalances between large healthy cohorts and
smaller clinical populations. At the image level, we quantify voxel spacing,
orientation, and intensity distributions across 15 representative datasets,
demonstrating substantial heterogeneity that can influence representation
learning. We then perform a quantitative evaluation of preprocessing
variability, examining how intensity normalization, bias field correction,
skull stripping, spatial registration, and interpolation alter voxel statistics
and geometry. While these steps improve within-dataset consistency, residual
differences persist between datasets. Finally, feature-space case study using a
3D DenseNet121 shows measurable residual covariate shift after standardized
preprocessing, confirming that harmonization alone cannot eliminate
inter-dataset bias. Together, these analyses provide a unified characterization
of variability in public brain MRI resources and emphasize the need for
preprocessing-aware and domain-adaptive strategies in the design of
generalizable brain MRI foundation models.

Abstract: Prompt design plays a crucial role in text-to-video (T2V) generation, yet
user-provided prompts are often short, unstructured, and misaligned with
training data, limiting the generative potential of diffusion-based T2V models.
We present \textbf{RAPO++}, a cross-stage prompt optimization framework that
unifies training-data--aligned refinement, test-time iterative scaling, and
large language model (LLM) fine-tuning to substantially improve T2V generation
without modifying the underlying generative backbone. In \textbf{Stage 1},
Retrieval-Augmented Prompt Optimization (RAPO) enriches user prompts with
semantically relevant modifiers retrieved from a relation graph and refactors
them to match training distributions, enhancing compositionality and
multi-object fidelity. \textbf{Stage 2} introduces Sample-Specific Prompt
Optimization (SSPO), a closed-loop mechanism that iteratively refines prompts
using multi-source feedback -- including semantic alignment, spatial fidelity,
temporal coherence, and task-specific signals such as optical flow -- yielding
progressively improved video generation quality. \textbf{Stage 3} leverages
optimized prompt pairs from SSPO to fine-tune the rewriter LLM, internalizing

TL;DR: FlowCycle是一种基于流的文本图像编辑框架，通过目标感知的中间状态和循环一致性约束，在无需反演的情况下实现高质量的图像编辑。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有文本图像编辑方法采用目标无关的中间状态构建方式，主要关注源图像重建而忽略与具体编辑目标的语义差距，导致在需要大幅修改时编辑能力有限或结果不一致。

Method: 提出FlowCycle框架，通过可学习的噪声参数化图像损坏过程，利用循环一致性过程进行优化，在源图像到目标图像的双向编辑中学习生成目标感知的中间状态。

Result: 大量消融实验表明，FlowCycle在编辑质量和一致性方面优于现有最先进方法。

Conclusion: 目标感知的中间状态构建是提升文本图像编辑性能的关键，FlowCycle通过循环一致性约束实现了更好的编辑效果。

Abstract: Recent advances in pre-trained text-to-image flow models have enabled
remarkable progress in text-based image editing. Mainstream approaches always
adopt a corruption-then-restoration paradigm, where the source image is first
corrupted into an ``intermediate state'' and then restored to the target image
under the prompt guidance. However, current methods construct this intermediate
state in a target-agnostic manner, i.e., they primarily focus on realizing
source image reconstruction while neglecting the semantic gaps towards the
specific editing target. This design inherently results in limited editability
or inconsistency when the desired modifications substantially deviate from the
source. In this paper, we argue that the intermediate state should be
target-aware, i.e., selectively corrupting editing-relevant contents while
preserving editing-irrelevant ones. To this end, we propose FlowCycle, a novel
inversion-free and flow-based editing framework that parameterizes corruption
with learnable noises and optimizes them through a cycle-consistent process. By
iteratively editing the source to the target and recovering back to the source
with dual consistency constraints, FlowCycle learns to produce a target-aware
intermediate state, enabling faithful modifications while preserving source
consistency. Extensive ablations have demonstrated that FlowCycle achieves
superior editing quality and consistency over state-of-the-art methods.

Motivation: 准确检测胎儿运动对评估产前健康至关重要，异常运动模式可能预示胎盘功能障碍或胎儿窘迫。传统方法如母体感知和胎心监护存在主观性强和准确性有限的问题。

Method: 提出对比超声视频表示学习(CURL)框架，采用双重对比损失结合空间和时间对比学习来学习稳健的运动表示，并引入任务特定采样策略和概率微调方法。

Conclusion: 自监督对比学习在胎儿运动分析中具有巨大潜力，为改善产前监测和临床决策铺平了道路。

Abstract: Accurate fetal movement (FM) detection is essential for assessing prenatal
health, as abnormal movement patterns can indicate underlying complications
such as placental dysfunction or fetal distress. Traditional methods, including
maternal perception and cardiotocography (CTG), suffer from subjectivity and
limited accuracy. To address these challenges, we propose Contrastive
Ultrasound Video Representation Learning (CURL), a novel self-supervised
learning framework for FM detection from extended fetal ultrasound video
recordings. Our approach leverages a dual-contrastive loss, incorporating both
spatial and temporal contrastive learning, to learn robust motion
representations. Additionally, we introduce a task-specific sampling strategy,
ensuring the effective separation of movement and non-movement segments during
self-supervised training, while enabling flexible inference on arbitrarily long
ultrasound recordings through a probabilistic fine-tuning approach. Evaluated
on an in-house dataset of 92 subjects, each with 30-minute ultrasound sessions,
CURL achieves a sensitivity of 78.01% and an AUROC of 81.60%, demonstrating its
potential for reliable and objective FM analysis. These results highlight the
potential of self-supervised contrastive learning for fetal movement analysis,
paving the way for improved prenatal monitoring and clinical decision-making.

Abstract: Adapting pretrained diffusion-based generative models for text-driven image
editing with negligible tuning overhead has demonstrated remarkable potential.
A classical adaptation paradigm, as followed by these methods, first infers the
generative trajectory inversely for a given source image by image inversion,
then performs image editing along the inferred trajectory guided by the target
text prompts. However, the performance of image editing is heavily limited by
the approximation errors introduced during image inversion by diffusion models,
which arise from the absence of exact supervision in the intermediate
generative steps. To circumvent this issue, we investigate the
parameter-efficient adaptation of VQ-based generative models for image editing,
and leverage their inherent characteristic that the exact intermediate
quantized representations of a source image are attainable, enabling more
effective supervision for precise image inversion. Specifically, we propose
\emph{EditInfinity}, which adapts \emph{Infinity}, a binary-quantized
generative model, for image editing. We propose an efficient yet effective
image inversion mechanism that integrates text prompting rectification and
image style preservation, enabling precise image inversion. Furthermore, we
devise a holistic smoothing strategy which allows our \emph{EditInfinity} to
perform image editing with high fidelity to source images and precise semantic
alignment to the text prompts. Extensive experiments on the PIE-Bench benchmark
across "add", "change", and "delete" editing operations, demonstrate the
superior performance of our model compared to state-of-the-art diffusion-based
baselines. Code available at: https://github.com/yx-chen-ust/EditInfinity.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出大型视觉语言模型在生成长文本时容易产生幻觉问题，研究发现幻觉并非由长度本身引起，而是源于对上下文连贯性的依赖增加。作者提出了"诱导-检测-抑制"框架来主动管理幻觉。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型在生成长文本响应时存在严重的幻觉问题，传统观点认为这是长度导致的错误累积，但作者质疑是否存在更深层的机制。

Method: 提出"诱导-检测-抑制"三步框架：通过设计的上下文主动诱导幻觉，利用诱导实例进行早期高风险检测，在实际解码过程中抑制潜在的对象级幻觉。

Result: 该方法在所有基准测试中都取得了显著且一致的改进，验证了框架的有效性，同时重新验证了关于上下文依赖的假设。

Conclusion: 研究不仅提供了性能改进，更重要的是为深入探索大型视觉语言模型长文本响应中的幻觉问题提供了新的见解和初步探索。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have made significant progress in recent
years but are also prone to hallucination issues. They exhibit more
hallucinations in longer, free-form responses, often attributed to accumulated
uncertainties. In this paper, we ask: Does increased hallucination result
solely from length-induced errors, or is there a deeper underlying mechanism?
After a series of preliminary experiments and findings, we suggest that the
risk of hallucinations is not caused by length itself but by the increased
reliance on context for coherence and completeness in longer responses.
Building on these insights, we propose a novel "induce-detect-suppress"
framework that actively induces hallucinations through deliberately designed
contexts, leverages induced instances for early detection of high-risk cases,
and ultimately suppresses potential object-level hallucinations during actual
decoding. Our approach achieves consistent, significant improvements across all
benchmarks, demonstrating its efficacy. The strong detection and improved
hallucination mitigation not only validate our framework but, more importantly,
re-validate our hypothesis on context. Rather than solely pursuing performance
gains, this study aims to provide new insights and serves as a first step
toward a deeper exploration of hallucinations in LVLMs' longer responses.

Motivation: 现有的基于高斯泼溅的方法要么依赖单一3D语言场导致分割效果差，要么依赖预计算的类无关分割导致错误累积。

Method: 引入协作场概念（实例场和语言场），通过实例到语言特征映射和两阶段训练策略构建协作场，并在推理时设计自适应语言到实例提示细化。

Conclusion: COS3D通过协作场设计有效整合了语言和分割线索，在开放词汇3D分割任务中取得了优异表现。

Abstract: Open-vocabulary 3D segmentation is a fundamental yet challenging task,
requiring a mutual understanding of both segmentation and language. However,
existing Gaussian-splatting-based methods rely either on a single 3D language
field, leading to inferior segmentation, or on pre-computed class-agnostic
segmentations, suffering from error accumulation. To address these limitations,
we present COS3D, a new collaborative prompt-segmentation framework that
contributes to effectively integrating complementary language and segmentation
cues throughout its entire pipeline. We first introduce the new concept of
collaborative field, comprising an instance field and a language field, as the
cornerstone for collaboration. During training, to effectively construct the
collaborative field, our key idea is to capture the intrinsic relationship
between the instance field and language field, through a novel
instance-to-language feature mapping and designing an efficient two-stage
training strategy. During inference, to bridge distinct characteristics of the
two fields, we further design an adaptive language-to-instance prompt
refinement, promoting high-quality prompt-segmentation inference. Extensive
experiments not only demonstrate COS3D's leading performance over existing
methods on two widely-used benchmarks but also show its high potential to
various applications,~\ie, novel image-based 3D segmentation, hierarchical
segmentation, and robotics. The code is publicly available at

TL;DR: DualGround是一种双分支架构的视频时间定位方法，通过分离全局和局部语义来改进视频-语言对齐，在多个基准测试中达到最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频时间定位方法在跨模态注意力中统一处理所有文本标记，忽视了它们不同的语义角色，导致模型过度依赖[EOS]驱动的全局语义而无法有效利用词级信号。

Method: 提出双分支架构：将[EOS]标记通过句子级路径处理，将词标记聚类为短语级单元进行局部定位；引入标记角色感知的跨模态交互策略和联合建模框架。

Result: 在QVHighlights和Charades-STA基准测试的Moment Retrieval和Highlight Detection任务中均达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: 解耦语义建模在视频-语言对齐中具有有效性，能够同时捕捉粗粒度和局部语义，实现更具表达力和上下文感知的视频定位。

Abstract: Video Temporal Grounding (VTG) aims to localize temporal segments in long,
untrimmed videos that align with a given natural language query. This task
typically comprises two subtasks: Moment Retrieval (MR) and Highlight Detection
(HD). While recent advances have been progressed by powerful pretrained
vision-language models such as CLIP and InternVideo2, existing approaches
commonly treat all text tokens uniformly during crossmodal attention,
disregarding their distinct semantic roles. To validate the limitations of this
approach, we conduct controlled experiments demonstrating that VTG models
overly rely on [EOS]-driven global semantics while failing to effectively
utilize word-level signals, which limits their ability to achieve fine-grained
temporal alignment. Motivated by this limitation, we propose DualGround, a
dual-branch architecture that explicitly separates global and local semantics
by routing the [EOS] token through a sentence-level path and clustering word
tokens into phrase-level units for localized grounding. Our method introduces
(1) tokenrole- aware cross modal interaction strategies that align video
features with sentence-level and phrase-level semantics in a structurally
disentangled manner, and (2) a joint modeling framework that not only improves
global sentence-level alignment but also enhances finegrained temporal
grounding by leveraging structured phrase-aware context. This design allows the
model to capture both coarse and localized semantics, enabling more expressive
and context-aware video grounding. DualGround achieves state-of-the-art
performance on both Moment Retrieval and Highlight Detection tasks across
QVHighlights and Charades- STA benchmarks, demonstrating the effectiveness of
disentangled semantic modeling in video-language alignment.

Motivation: 现有方法依赖基于关键点的位置编码，仅捕获2D坐标而忽略物体形状信息，导致对标注偏移敏感且跨视角匹配能力有限。

Method: 提出掩码位置编码(MPE)捕获空间坐标和物体轮廓，设计上下文增强模块(CEM)使用水平和垂直条带卷积核提取长距离上下文特征，构建EDGeo端到端框架。

Result: 在两个公开数据集上实现最先进性能，在地面到卫星场景下定位精度提升3.39%。

Conclusion: 为跨视角地理定位研究提供了鲁棒的位置编码范例和上下文建模框架。

Abstract: Cross-view object geo-localization enables high-precision object localization
through cross-view matching, with critical applications in autonomous driving,
urban management, and disaster response. However, existing methods rely on
keypoint-based positional encoding, which captures only 2D coordinates while
neglecting object shape information, resulting in sensitivity to annotation
shifts and limited cross-view matching capability. To address these
limitations, we propose a mask-based positional encoding scheme that leverages
segmentation masks to capture both spatial coordinates and object silhouettes,
thereby upgrading the model from "location-aware" to "object-aware."
Furthermore, to tackle the challenge of large-span objects (e.g., elongated
buildings) in satellite imagery, we design a context enhancement module. This
module employs horizontal and vertical strip convolutional kernels to extract
long-range contextual features, enhancing feature discrimination among
strip-like objects. Integrating MPE and CEM, we present EDGeo, an end-to-end
framework for robust cross-view object geo-localization. Extensive experiments
on two public datasets (CVOGL and VIGOR-Building) demonstrate that our method
achieves state-of-the-art performance, with a 3.39% improvement in localization
accuracy under challenging ground-to-satellite scenarios. This work provides a
robust positional encoding paradigm and a contextual modeling framework for
advancing cross-view geo-localization research.

Conclusion: CMC能有效缓解文本主导问题，引导融合过程达成更可靠的多模态共识，提升情感识别性能

Abstract: In recent years, Multimodal Emotion Recognition (MER) has made substantial
progress. Nevertheless, most existing approaches neglect the semantic
inconsistencies that may arise across modalities, such as conflicting emotional
cues between text and visual inputs. Besides, current methods are often
dominated by the text modality due to its strong representational capacity,
which can compromise recognition accuracy. To address these challenges, we
propose a model termed Calibrated Multimodal Consensus (CMC). CMC introduces a
Pseudo Label Generation Module (PLGM) to produce pseudo unimodal labels,
enabling unimodal pretraining in a self-supervised fashion. It then employs a
Parameter-free Fusion Module (PFM) and a Multimodal Consensus Router (MCR) for
multimodal finetuning, thereby mitigating text dominance and guiding the fusion
process toward a more reliable consensus. Experimental results demonstrate that
CMC achieves performance on par with or superior to state-of-the-art methods
across four datasets, CH-SIMS, CH-SIMS v2, CMU-MOSI, and CMU-MOSEI, and
exhibits notable advantages in scenarios with semantic inconsistencies on
CH-SIMS and CH-SIMS v2. The implementation of this work is publicly accessible

Result: 在四个主要数据集上实现了最先进的性能，消融实验验证了GMFVAD的改进确实源于冗余信息的减少。

Conclusion: 通过细粒度多模态特征处理可以有效减少视觉特征中的冗余信息，显著提升视频异常检测的性能。

Abstract: Video anomaly detection (VAD) is a challenging task that detects anomalous
frames in continuous surveillance videos. Most previous work utilizes the
spatio-temporal correlation of visual features to distinguish whether there are
abnormalities in video snippets. Recently, some works attempt to introduce
multi-modal information, like text feature, to enhance the results of video
anomaly detection. However, these works merely incorporate text features into
video snippets in a coarse manner, overlooking the significant amount of
redundant information that may exist within the video snippets. Therefore, we
propose to leverage the diversity among multi-modal information to further
refine the extracted features, reducing the redundancy in visual features, and
we propose Grained Multi-modal Feature for Video Anomaly Detection (GMFVAD).
Specifically, we generate more grained multi-modal feature based on the video
snippet, which summarizes the main content, and text features based on the
captions of original video will be introduced to further enhance the visual
features of highlighted portions. Experiments show that the proposed GMFVAD
achieves state-of-the-art performance on four mainly datasets. Ablation
experiments also validate that the improvement of GMFVAD is due to the
reduction of redundant information.

Abstract: Visual Commonsense Reasoning (VCR) refers to answering questions and
providing explanations based on images. While existing methods achieve high
prediction accuracy, they often overlook bias in datasets and lack debiasing
strategies. In this paper, our analysis reveals co-occurrence and statistical
biases in both textual and visual data. We introduce the VCR-OOD datasets,
comprising VCR-OOD-QA and VCR-OOD-VA subsets, which are designed to evaluate
the generalization capabilities of models across two modalities. Furthermore,
we analyze the causal graphs and prediction shortcuts in VCR and adopt a
backdoor adjustment method to remove bias. Specifically, we create a dictionary
based on the set of correct answers to eliminate prediction shortcuts.
Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our debiasing method across
different datasets.

Conclusion: KINN有效解决了表示三难问题，为SAR图像分析中的可信AI提供了新路径。

Abstract: Deep learning models for complex-valued Synthetic Aperture Radar (CV-SAR)
image recognition are fundamentally constrained by a representation trilemma
under data-limited and domain-shift scenarios: the concurrent, yet conflicting,
optimization of generalization, interpretability, and efficiency. Our work is
motivated by the premise that the rich electromagnetic scattering features
inherent in CV-SAR data hold the key to resolving this trilemma, yet they are
insufficiently harnessed by conventional data-driven models. To this end, we
introduce the Knowledge-Informed Neural Network (KINN), a lightweight framework
built upon a novel "compression-aggregation-compression" architecture. The
first stage performs a physics-guided compression, wherein a novel dictionary
processor adaptively embeds physical priors, enabling a compact unfolding
network to efficiently extract sparse, physically-grounded signatures. A
subsequent aggregation module enriches these representations, followed by a
final semantic compression stage that utilizes a compact classification head
with self-distillation to learn maximally task-relevant and discriminative
embeddings. We instantiate KINN in both CNN (0.7M) and Vision Transformer
(0.95M) variants. Extensive evaluations on five SAR benchmarks confirm that
KINN establishes a state-of-the-art in parameter-efficient recognition,
offering exceptional generalization in data-scarce and out-of-distribution
scenarios and tangible interpretability, thereby providing an effective
solution to the representation trilemma and offering a new path for trustworthy
AI in SAR image analysis.

Conclusion: DMC³框架通过反事实对比学习有效提升了第一人称视频问答的性能

Abstract: Egocentric Video Question Answering (Egocentric VideoQA) plays an important
role in egocentric video understanding, which refers to answering questions
based on first-person videos. Although existing methods have made progress
through the paradigm of pre-training and fine-tuning, they ignore the unique
challenges posed by the first-person perspective, such as understanding
multiple events and recognizing hand-object interactions. To deal with these
challenges, we propose a Dual-Modal Counterfactual Contrastive Construction
(DMC$^3$) framework, which contains an egocentric videoqa baseline, a
counterfactual sample construction module and a counterfactual sample-involved
contrastive optimization. Specifically, We first develop a counterfactual
sample construction module to generate positive and negative samples for
textual and visual modalities through event description paraphrasing and core
interaction mining, respectively. Then, We feed these samples together with the
original samples into the baseline. Finally, in the counterfactual
sample-involved contrastive optimization module, we apply contrastive loss to
minimize the distance between the original sample features and the positive
sample features, while maximizing the distance from the negative samples.
Experiments show that our method achieve 52.51\% and 46.04\% on the
\textit{normal} and \textit{indirect} splits of EgoTaskQA, and 13.2\% on
QAEGO4D, both reaching the state-of-the-art performance.

TL;DR: 本文提出了Instruction-as-Reasoning范式，将指令视为动态分析路径，通过两阶段训练框架（SFT+RL）优化路径选择和组合，在GUI grounding任务上取得SOTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有工作将指令视为用户意图的静态代理，忽视了指令多样性和质量对grounding性能的影响。研究发现现有数据集中23.3%的指令存在缺陷，且利用指令多样性可在推理时获得76%的相对性能提升。

Method: 提出Instruction-as-Reasoning范式，将指令视为动态分析路径。采用两阶段训练框架：首先通过监督微调（SFT）在合成的多样化指令上训练，培养多视角推理能力；然后通过强化学习（RL）优化路径选择和组合。

Result: UI-Ins-7B和UI-Ins-32B模型在五个挑战性grounding基准测试中达到SOTA：UI-I2E-Bench（87.3%）、ScreenSpot-Pro（57.0%）、MMBench-GUI L2（84.9%）。UI-Ins-7B在AndroidWorld上达到74.1%的成功率。

Conclusion: 该方法不仅提升了grounding性能，还展现出涌现推理能力，能够在推理时选择性组合和合成新的指令路径。同时缓解了SFT+RL框架中的策略崩溃问题。

Abstract: GUI grounding, which maps natural-language instructions to actionable UI
elements, is a core capability of GUI agents. Prior works largely treats
instructions as a static proxy for user intent, overlooking the impact of
instruction diversity and quality on grounding performance. Through a careful
investigation of existing grounding datasets, we find a 23.3% flaw rate in
their instructions and show that inference-time exploitation of instruction
diversity yields up to a substantial 76% relative performance improvement. In
this paper, we introduce the Instruction-as-Reasoning paradigm, treating
instructions as dynamic analytical pathways that offer distinct perspectives
and enabling the model to select the most effective pathway during reasoning.
To achieve this, we propose a two-stage training framework: supervised
fine-tuning (SFT) on synthesized, diverse instructions to instill
multi-perspective reasoning, followed by reinforcement learning (RL) to
optimize pathway selection and composition. Our resulting models, UI-Ins-7B and
UI-Ins-32B, achieve state-of-the-art results on five challenging grounding
benchmarks and exhibit emergent reasoning, selectively composing and
synthesizing novel instruction pathways at inference. In particular, UI-Ins-32B
attains the best grounding accuracy, scoring 87.3% on UI-I2E-Bench, 57.0% on
ScreenSpot-Pro, and 84.9% on MMBench-GUI L2. Furthermore, our model
demonstrates strong agentic potential, achieving a 74.1% success rate on
AndroidWorld using UI-Ins-7B as the executor. Our in-depth analysis reveals
additional insights such as how reasoning can be formulated to enhance rather
than hinder grounding performance, and how our method mitigates policy collapse
in the SFT+RL framework. All code and model checkpoints will be publicly
released in https://github.com/alibaba/UI-Ins.

Abstract: We present a winning solution to RoboSense 2025 Track 4: Cross-Modal Drone
Navigation. The task retrieves the most relevant geo-referenced image from a
large multi-platform corpus (satellite/drone/ground) given a natural-language
query. Two obstacles are severe inter-platform heterogeneity and a domain gap
between generic training descriptions and platform-specific test queries. We
mitigate these with a domain-aligned preprocessing pipeline and a

augmentation, and removal of orientation words; (ii) an LLM-based caption
refinement pipeline to align textual semantics with the distinct visual
characteristics of each platform. Using BGE-M3 (text) and EVA-CLIP (image), we
train three platform experts using a progressive two-stage, hard-negative
mining strategy to enhance discriminative power, and fuse their scores at
inference. The system tops the official leaderboard, demonstrating robust
cross-modal geo-localization under heterogeneous viewpoints.

TL;DR: 提出HyperET训练范式，利用双曲空间解决多模态大语言模型中视觉编码器与语言在多粒度级别对齐不足的问题，显著提升训练效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型训练需要极高计算资源，主要原因是广泛使用的视觉编码器（如CLIP、SAM）缺乏与语言在多粒度级别的对齐。

Method: 利用双曲空间建模层次结构，通过动态调整双曲半径实现视觉表示与文本表示在任意粒度级别的对齐，采用可学习矩阵和Möbius乘法操作。

Result: 在多个MLLM基准测试中，HyperET仅增加不到1%的参数就能显著提升现有预训练和微调MLLM的性能。

Conclusion: HyperET提供了一种高效的多模态对齐训练范式，通过双曲空间有效解决了视觉-文本多粒度对齐问题。

Abstract: Multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have emerged as a transformative
approach for aligning visual and textual understanding. They typically require
extremely high computational resources (e.g., thousands of GPUs) for training
to achieve cross-modal alignment at multi-granularity levels. We argue that a
key source of this inefficiency lies in the vision encoders they widely equip
with, e.g., CLIP and SAM, which lack the alignment with language at
multi-granularity levels. To address this issue, in this paper, we leverage
hyperbolic space, which inherently models hierarchical levels and thus provides
a principled framework for bridging the granularity gap between visual and
textual modalities at an arbitrary granularity level. Concretely, we propose an
efficient training paradigm for MLLMs, dubbed as HyperET, which can optimize
visual representations to align with their textual counterparts at an arbitrary
granularity level through dynamic hyperbolic radius adjustment in hyperbolic
space. HyperET employs learnable matrices with M\"{o}bius multiplication
operations, implemented via three effective configurations: diagonal scaling
matrices, block-diagonal matrices, and banded matrices, providing a flexible
yet efficient parametrization strategy. Comprehensive experiments across
multiple MLLM benchmarks demonstrate that HyperET consistently improves both
existing pre-training and fine-tuning MLLMs clearly with less than 1\%
additional parameters.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决基于深度学习的点云几何压缩中的泛化挑战，主要源于缺乏鲁棒的上下文模型和对OOD数据处理的低效。

Method: 使用通用上下文模型结合空间和通道分组先验来捕捉上下文依赖；提出实例自适应微调策略，通过微调网络权重子集并纳入比特流来处理OOD数据。

Result: 在包含15个不同数据集的基准测试中，AnyPcc在点云压缩方面达到了新的最先进水平。

Conclusion: AnyPcc通过创新的上下文建模和自适应微调策略，有效解决了点云压缩中的泛化问题，为可复现研究提供了代码和数据集。

Abstract: Generalization remains a critical challenge for deep learning-based point
cloud geometry compression. We argue this stems from two key limitations: the
lack of robust context models and the inefficient handling of
out-of-distribution (OOD) data. To address both, we introduce AnyPcc, a
universal point cloud compression framework. AnyPcc first employs a Universal
Context Model that leverages priors from both spatial and channel-wise grouping
to capture robust contextual dependencies. Second, our novel Instance-Adaptive
Fine-Tuning (IAFT) strategy tackles OOD data by synergizing explicit and
implicit compression paradigms. It fine-tunes a small subset of network weights
for each instance and incorporates them into the bitstream, where the marginal
bit cost of the weights is dwarfed by the resulting savings in geometry
compression. Extensive experiments on a benchmark of 15 diverse datasets
confirm that AnyPcc sets a new state-of-the-art in point cloud compression. Our
code and datasets will be released to encourage reproducible research.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在采样过程中，量化误差会在多个去噪步骤中累积，影响生成质量。现有方法独立处理每个步骤的误差，无法解决累积问题。

Method: AccuQuant在量化过程中显式模拟多个去噪步骤，考虑误差累积效应，并提出高效实现技术将内存复杂度从O(n)降至O(1)。

Result: 在多个任务和扩散模型的标准基准测试中，AccuQuant展现出优异的效能和效率。

Conclusion: AccuQuant通过解决量化误差累积问题，为扩散模型提供了一种高效的后训练量化解决方案。

Abstract: We present in this paper a novel post-training quantization (PTQ) method,
dubbed AccuQuant, for diffusion models. We show analytically and empirically
that quantization errors for diffusion models are accumulated over denoising
steps in a sampling process. To alleviate the error accumulation problem,
AccuQuant minimizes the discrepancies between outputs of a full-precision
diffusion model and its quantized version within a couple of denoising steps.
That is, it simulates multiple denoising steps of a diffusion sampling process
explicitly for quantization, accounting the accumulated errors over multiple
denoising steps, which is in contrast to previous approaches to imitating a
training process of diffusion models, namely, minimizing the discrepancies
independently for each step. We also present an efficient implementation
technique for AccuQuant, together with a novel objective, which reduces a
memory complexity significantly from $\mathcal{O}(n)$ to $\mathcal{O}(1)$,
where $n$ is the number of denoising steps. We demonstrate the efficacy and
efficiency of AccuQuant across various tasks and diffusion models on standard
benchmarks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 重新审视DiT如何组织视觉内容，发现补丁令牌表现出惊人的独立性：即使位置编码被扰动，DiT仍能产生全局一致的输出，表明空间一致性主要由位置编码控制。

Method: 引入位置编码场(PE-Field)，将位置编码从2D平面扩展到结构化3D场，包含深度感知编码用于体积推理和分层编码用于细粒度子补丁控制。

Result: PE-Field增强的DiT在单图像新视角合成任务上达到最先进性能，并能推广到可控空间图像编辑。

Conclusion: 通过将位置编码扩展到3D场，DiT能够直接在3D空间中建模几何，显著提升了视觉生成模型的性能。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have emerged as the dominant architecture for
visual generation, powering state-of-the-art image and video models. By
representing images as patch tokens with positional encodings (PEs), DiTs
combine Transformer scalability with spatial and temporal inductive biases. In
this work, we revisit how DiTs organize visual content and discover that patch
tokens exhibit a surprising degree of independence: even when PEs are
perturbed, DiTs still produce globally coherent outputs, indicating that
spatial coherence is primarily governed by PEs. Motivated by this finding, we
introduce the Positional Encoding Field (PE-Field), which extends positional
encodings from the 2D plane to a structured 3D field. PE-Field incorporates
depth-aware encodings for volumetric reasoning and hierarchical encodings for
fine-grained sub-patch control, enabling DiTs to model geometry directly in 3D
space. Our PE-Field-augmented DiT achieves state-of-the-art performance on
single-image novel view synthesis and generalizes to controllable spatial image
editing.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种因果表示学习方法，通过预测图像中可能被忽略的烹饪元素并显式注入到跨模态表示学习中，以缓解图像-食谱检索中的偏见问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有图像-食谱检索方法假设食物图像能完全捕捉食谱的文本细节，但实际上图像只反映烹饪结果而非过程，导致表示学习偏向主导视觉元素，难以区分具有细微差异的相似食谱。

Method: 使用因果方法预测图像中可能被忽略的烹饪元素，并将这些元素显式注入到跨模态表示学习中，以减轻表示偏见。

Result: 在标准单语Recipe1M数据集和新构建的多语言多文化美食数据集上的实验表明，该方法能够发现细微的配料和烹饪动作，并在单语和多语言多文化数据集上都取得了令人印象深刻的检索性能。

Conclusion: 提出的因果表示学习方法有效解决了图像-食谱检索中的表示偏见问题，能够捕捉视觉不明显但对食谱检索至关重要的细节信息。

Abstract: Existing approaches for image-to-recipe retrieval have the implicit
assumption that a food image can fully capture the details textually documented
in its recipe. However, a food image only reflects the visual outcome of a
cooked dish and not the underlying cooking process. Consequently, learning
cross-modal representations to bridge the modality gap between images and
recipes tends to ignore subtle, recipe-specific details that are not visually
apparent but are crucial for recipe retrieval. Specifically, the
representations are biased to capture the dominant visual elements, resulting
in difficulty in ranking similar recipes with subtle differences in use of
ingredients and cooking methods. The bias in representation learning is
expected to be more severe when the training data is mixed of images and
recipes sourced from different cuisines. This paper proposes a novel causal
approach that predicts the culinary elements potentially overlooked in images,
while explicitly injecting these elements into cross-modal representation
learning to mitigate biases. Experiments are conducted on the standard
monolingual Recipe1M dataset and a newly curated multilingual multicultural
cuisine dataset. The results indicate that the proposed causal representation
learning is capable of uncovering subtle ingredients and cooking actions and
achieves impressive retrieval performance on both monolingual and multilingual
multicultural datasets.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统静态知识蒸馏方法在处理肺癌图像不确定性时存在局限，需要动态调整蒸馏权重来关注高置信度区域，减少对模糊区域的注意力，提高模型对疾病诊断复杂性的处理能力。

Conclusion: 动态模糊逻辑知识蒸馏方法能有效处理肺癌分类中的不确定性，结合图像融合优化和模型选择策略，实现了高精度和跨域鲁棒性的肺癌诊断模型。

Abstract: This paper presents the FuzzyDistillViT-MobileNet model, a novel approach for
lung cancer (LC) classification, leveraging dynamic fuzzy logic-driven
knowledge distillation (KD) to address uncertainty and complexity in disease
diagnosis. Unlike traditional models that rely on static KD with fixed weights,
our method dynamically adjusts the distillation weight using fuzzy logic,
enabling the student model to focus on high-confidence regions while reducing
attention to ambiguous areas. This dynamic adjustment improves the model
ability to handle varying uncertainty levels across different regions of LC
images. We employ the Vision Transformer (ViT-B32) as the instructor model,
which effectively transfers knowledge to the student model, MobileNet,
enhancing the student generalization capabilities. The training process is
further optimized using a dynamic wait adjustment mechanism that adapts the
training procedure for improved convergence and performance. To enhance image
quality, we introduce pixel-level image fusion improvement techniques such as
Gamma correction and Histogram Equalization. The processed images (Pix1 and
Pix2) are fused using a wavelet-based fusion method to improve image resolution
and feature preservation. This fusion method uses the wavedec2 function to
standardize images to a 224x224 resolution, decompose them into multi-scale
frequency components, and recursively average coefficients at each level for
better feature representation. To address computational efficiency, Genetic
Algorithm (GA) is used to select the most suitable pre-trained student model
from a pool of 12 candidates, balancing model performance with computational
cost. The model is evaluated on two datasets, including LC25000
histopathological images (99.16% accuracy) and IQOTH/NCCD CT-scan images
(99.54% accuracy), demonstrating robustness across different imaging domains.

Motivation: 解决多模态大语言模型在视频推理中存在的文本链产生无根据结论和帧检索方法证据定位不准的问题。

Method: 构建Conan-91K大规模自动生成推理轨迹数据集，设计多阶段渐进冷启动策略和Identification-Reasoning-Action强化学习训练框架。

Result: 在6个多步骤推理基准测试中，Conan比基线Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct平均准确率提升超过10%，达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: Conan框架有效提升了多步骤视频推理能力，并在长视频理解任务中展现出良好的可扩展性和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Video reasoning, which requires multi-step deduction across frames, remains a
major challenge for multimodal large language models (MLLMs). While
reinforcement learning (RL)-based methods enhance reasoning capabilities, they
often rely on text-only chains that yield ungrounded or hallucinated
conclusions. Conversely, frame-retrieval approaches introduce visual grounding
but still struggle with inaccurate evidence localization. To address these
challenges, we present Conan, a framework for evidence-grounded multi-step
video reasoning. Conan identifies contextual and evidence frames, reasons over
cross-frame clues, and adaptively decides when to conclude or explore further.
To achieve this, we (1) construct Conan-91K, a large-scale dataset of
automatically generated reasoning traces that includes frame identification,
evidence reasoning, and action decision, and (2) design a multi-stage
progressive cold-start strategy combined with an
Identification-Reasoning-Action (AIR) RLVR training framework to jointly
enhance multi-step visual reasoning. Extensive experiments on six multi-step
reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that Conan surpasses the baseline
Qwen2.5-VL-7B-Instruct by an average of over 10% in accuracy, achieving
state-of-the-art performance. Furthermore, Conan generalizes effectively to
long-video understanding tasks, validating its strong scalability and
robustness.

Conclusion: 这项工作为公平性审计中的人口属性推断提供了可靠基础，通过提高推断可靠性来减少公平性估计的偏差，并促进了透明度和可复现性。

Abstract: Fairness evaluation in face analysis systems (FAS) typically depends on
automatic demographic attribute inference (DAI), which itself relies on
predefined demographic segmentation. However, the validity of fairness auditing
hinges on the reliability of the DAI process. We begin by providing a
theoretical motivation for this dependency, showing that improved DAI
reliability leads to less biased and lower-variance estimates of FAS fairness.
To address this, we propose a fully reproducible DAI pipeline that replaces
conventional end-to-end training with a modular transfer learning approach. Our
design integrates pretrained face recognition encoders with non-linear
classification heads. We audit this pipeline across three dimensions: accuracy,
fairness, and a newly introduced notion of robustness, defined via
intra-identity consistency. The proposed robustness metric is applicable to any
demographic segmentation scheme. We benchmark the pipeline on gender and
ethnicity inference across multiple datasets and training setups. Our results
show that the proposed method outperforms strong baselines, particularly on
ethnicity, which is the more challenging attribute. To promote transparency and
reproducibility, we will publicly release the training dataset metadata, full
codebase, pretrained models, and evaluation toolkit. This work contributes a
reliable foundation for demographic inference in fairness auditing.

Motivation: 解决一步扩散模型在个性化新概念时能力有限的问题，需要在保持快速生成的同时有效整合新概念。

Method: 采用端到端训练，多步扩散模型(教师)和一步扩散模型(学生)同时训练，通过双向概念蒸馏机制，包括概念从教师到学生的蒸馏和从学生到教师的反馈。

Conclusion: EchoDistill为T2I扩散模型中的快速有效个性化建立了新范式，通过双向蒸馏机制实现了概念的有效传递和模型性能的共同提升。

Abstract: Recent advances in accelerating text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have
enabled the synthesis of high-fidelity images even in a single step. However,
personalizing these models to incorporate novel concepts remains a challenge
due to the limited capacity of one-step models to capture new concept
distributions effectively. We propose a bidirectional concept distillation
framework, EchoDistill, to enable one-step diffusion personalization (1-SDP).
Our approach involves an end-to-end training process where a multi-step
diffusion model (teacher) and a one-step diffusion model (student) are trained
simultaneously. The concept is first distilled from the teacher model to the
student, and then echoed back from the student to the teacher. During the
EchoDistill, we share the text encoder between the two models to ensure
consistent semantic understanding. Following this, the student model is
optimized with adversarial losses to align with the real image distribution and
with alignment losses to maintain consistency with the teacher's output.
Furthermore, we introduce the bidirectional echoing refinement strategy,
wherein the student model leverages its faster generation capability to
feedback to the teacher model. This bidirectional concept distillation
mechanism not only enhances the student ability to personalize novel concepts
but also improves the generative quality of the teacher model. Our experiments
demonstrate that this collaborative framework significantly outperforms
existing personalization methods over the 1-SDP setup, establishing a novel
paradigm for rapid and effective personalization in T2I diffusion models.

Abstract: Inspired by recent advancements in LLM reasoning, the field of multimodal
reasoning has seen remarkable progress, achieving significant performance gains
on intricate tasks such as mathematical problem-solving. Despite this progress,
current multimodal large reasoning models exhibit two key limitations. They
tend to employ computationally expensive reasoning even for simple queries,
leading to inefficiency. Furthermore, this focus on specialized reasoning often
impairs their broader, more general understanding capabilities. In this paper,
we propose Metis-HOME: a Hybrid Optimized Mixture-of-Experts framework designed
to address this trade-off. Metis-HOME enables a ''Hybrid Thinking'' paradigm by
structuring the original dense model into two distinct expert branches: a
thinking branch tailored for complex, multi-step reasoning, and a non-thinking
branch optimized for rapid, direct inference on tasks like general VQA and OCR.
A lightweight, trainable router dynamically allocates queries to the most
suitable expert. We instantiate Metis-HOME by adapting the Qwen2.5-VL-7B into
an MoE architecture. Comprehensive evaluations reveal that our approach not
only substantially enhances complex reasoning abilities but also improves the
model's general capabilities, reversing the degradation trend observed in other
reasoning-specialized models. Our work establishes a new paradigm for building
powerful and versatile MLLMs, effectively resolving the prevalent
reasoning-vs-generalization dilemma.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了Fake-in-Facext (FiFa)框架，通过细粒度面部区域划分和新的Artifact-Grounding Explanation任务，解决了当前多模态大语言模型在可解释深度伪造分析中缺乏细粒度感知能力的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前多模态大语言模型在可解释深度伪造分析中存在细粒度感知不足的问题：数据标注不可靠且粗粒度，模型无法输出文本伪造解释与视觉伪影证据之间的连接，也不支持任意面部区域的查询输入。

Method: 首先定义面部图像概念树(FICT)对面部图像进行细粒度区域划分，建立可靠的数据标注流程FiFa-Annotator；然后提出Artifact-Grounding Explanation(AGE)任务，生成与分割掩码交织的文本伪造解释；最后构建统一的多任务学习架构FiFa-MLLM，支持丰富的多模态输入输出。

Result: FiFa-MLLM在AGE任务上优于强基线模型，在现有XDFA数据集上达到SOTA性能。

Conclusion: FiFa框架通过细粒度数据标注和统一的多任务架构，显著提升了多模态大语言模型在可解释深度伪造分析中的性能，实现了更可靠的伪造解释生成。

Abstract: The advancement of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has bridged the
gap between vision and language tasks, enabling the implementation of
Explainable DeepFake Analysis (XDFA). However, current methods suffer from a
lack of fine-grained awareness: the description of artifacts in data annotation
is unreliable and coarse-grained, and the models fail to support the output of
connections between textual forgery explanations and the visual evidence of
artifacts, as well as the input of queries for arbitrary facial regions. As a
result, their responses are not sufficiently grounded in Face Visual Context
(Facext). To address this limitation, we propose the Fake-in-Facext (FiFa)
framework, with contributions focusing on data annotation and model
construction. We first define a Facial Image Concept Tree (FICT) to divide
facial images into fine-grained regional concepts, thereby obtaining a more
reliable data annotation pipeline, FiFa-Annotator, for forgery explanation.
Based on this dedicated data annotation, we introduce a novel
Artifact-Grounding Explanation (AGE) task, which generates textual forgery
explanations interleaved with segmentation masks of manipulated artifacts. We
propose a unified multi-task learning architecture, FiFa-MLLM, to
simultaneously support abundant multimodal inputs and outputs for fine-grained
Explainable DeepFake Analysis. With multiple auxiliary supervision tasks,
FiFa-MLLM can outperform strong baselines on the AGE task and achieve SOTA
performance on existing XDFA datasets. The code and data will be made
open-source at https://github.com/lxq1000/Fake-in-Facext.

TL;DR: 提出一种深度学习框架，从单张模糊图像联合估计潜在清晰图像和相机运动轨迹，在严重或空间变化模糊情况下实现最先进性能。


<details>

Motivation: 相机抖动导致的大范围或旋转运动模糊仍然是图像恢复中的主要挑战，现有端到端去模糊网络在严重模糊情况下表现不佳。

Method: 利用投影运动模糊模型，通过可微分模糊创建模块实现。神经网络预测完整3D旋转轨迹，指导基于模型的端到端恢复网络，并通过重模糊损失优化轨迹。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上达到最先进性能，特别是在严重或空间变化模糊情况下表现优异。

Conclusion: 提出的模块化架构提供可解释性，能够重建生成模糊图像的清晰图像序列，在挑战性模糊场景中优于端到端方法。

Abstract: Motion blur caused by camera shake, particularly under large or rotational
movements, remains a major challenge in image restoration. We propose a deep
learning framework that jointly estimates the latent sharp image and the
underlying camera motion trajectory from a single blurry image. Our method
leverages the Projective Motion Blur Model (PMBM), implemented efficiently
using a differentiable blur creation module compatible with modern networks. A
neural network predicts a full 3D rotation trajectory, which guides a
model-based restoration network trained end-to-end. This modular architecture
provides interpretability by revealing the camera motion that produced the
blur. Moreover, this trajectory enables the reconstruction of the sequence of
sharp images that generated the observed blurry image. To further refine
results, we optimize the trajectory post-inference via a reblur loss, improving
consistency between the blurry input and the restored output. Extensive
experiments show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on both
synthetic and real datasets, particularly in cases with severe or spatially
variant blur, where end-to-end deblurring networks struggle.

Abstract: Despite advancements in SLAM technologies, robust operation under challenging
conditions such as low-texture, motion-blur, or challenging lighting remains an

Motivation: 解决消费级相机在复杂光照条件（低光、高动态范围、背光、空间色温变化）下图像质量不稳定的问题，包括曝光不足、色偏和色调不一致，这些会降低下游视觉任务的性能。

Method: 框架包含两个模块：ACamera-Exposure估计ISO以缓解曝光不足和对比度损失，ACamera-Color预测相关色温和增益因子以改善色彩一致性。针对边缘设备实时推理优化，可无缝集成到成像流水线中。

Result: 在多样化真实世界数据上训练，模型在不同光照条件下泛化良好。大量实验表明ACamera-Net持续提升图像质量并稳定感知输出，优于传统自动模式和轻量级基线方法。

Conclusion: ACamera-Net无需依赖额外的图像增强模块，就能有效解决复杂光照条件下的相机参数优化问题，在边缘设备上实现实时性能。

Abstract: Consumer-grade camera systems often struggle to maintain stable image quality
under complex illumination conditions such as low light, high dynamic range,
and backlighting, as well as spatial color temperature variation. These issues
lead to underexposure, color casts, and tonal inconsistency, which degrade the
performance of downstream vision tasks. To address this, we propose
ACamera-Net, a lightweight and scene-adaptive camera parameter adjustment
network that directly predicts optimal exposure and white balance from RAW
inputs. The framework consists of two modules: ACamera-Exposure, which
estimates ISO to alleviate underexposure and contrast loss, and ACamera-Color,
which predicts correlated color temperature and gain factors for improved color
consistency. Optimized for real-time inference on edge devices, ACamera-Net can
be seamlessly integrated into imaging pipelines. Trained on diverse real-world
data with annotated references, the model generalizes well across lighting
conditions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ACamera-Net consistently
enhances image quality and stabilizes perception outputs, outperforming
conventional auto modes and lightweight baselines without relying on additional
image enhancement modules.

Abstract: The realization of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) necessitates
Embodied AI agents capable of robust spatial perception, effective task
planning, and adaptive execution in physical environments. However, current
large language models (LLMs) and multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) for embodied tasks
suffer from key limitations, including a significant gap between model design
and agent requirements, an unavoidable trade-off between real-time latency and
performance, and the use of unauthentic, offline evaluation metrics. To address
these challenges, we propose EmbodiedBrain, a novel vision-language foundation
model available in both 7B and 32B parameter sizes. Our framework features an
agent-aligned data structure and employs a powerful training methodology that
integrates large-scale Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) with Step-Augumented Group
Relative Policy Optimization (Step-GRPO), which boosts long-horizon task
success by integrating preceding steps as Guided Precursors. Furthermore, we
incorporate a comprehensive reward system, including a Generative Reward Model
(GRM) accelerated at the infrastructure level, to improve training efficiency.
For enable thorough validation, we establish a three-part evaluation system
encompassing General, Planning, and End-to-End Simulation Benchmarks,
highlighted by the proposal and open-sourcing of a novel, challenging
simulation environment. Experimental results demonstrate that EmbodiedBrain
achieves superior performance across all metrics, establishing a new
state-of-the-art for embodied foundation models. Towards paving the way for the
next generation of generalist embodied agents, we open-source all of our data,
model weight, and evaluating methods, which are available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Open-o3 Video是一个非代理框架，将显式时空证据整合到视频推理中，通过精心收集的训练数据和训练策略解决时空跟踪和定位的挑战，在V-STAR基准上取得最先进性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频推理模型只生成文本推理轨迹，不指示关键证据出现的时间和位置。将证据中心推理能力扩展到视频更具挑战性，需要跨动态场景的联合时间跟踪和空间定位。

Method: 构建两个高质量数据集STGR-CoT-30k和STGR-RL-36k，提供统一的时空监督和推理轨迹；采用冷启动强化学习策略，设计多个专门奖励函数，共同鼓励答案准确性、时间对齐和空间精度。

Result: 在V-STAR基准上，Open-o3 Video实现了最先进性能，将Qwen2.5-VL基线的mAM提高了14.4%，mLGM提高了24.2%。在多个视频理解基准上观察到一致改进。

Conclusion: Open-o3 Video不仅提高了准确性，其生成的推理轨迹还为测试时扩展提供了有价值信号，实现了置信度感知验证并提高了答案可靠性。

Abstract: Most video reasoning models only generate textual reasoning traces without
indicating when and where key evidence appears. Recent models such as OpenAI-o3
have sparked wide interest in evidence-centered reasoning for images, yet
extending this ability to videos is more challenging, as it requires joint
temporal tracking and spatial localization across dynamic scenes. We introduce
Open-o3 Video, a non-agent framework that integrates explicit spatio-temporal
evidence into video reasoning, and carefully collect training data and design
training strategies to address the aforementioned challenges. The model
highlights key timestamps, objects, and bounding boxes alongside its answers,
allowing reasoning to be grounded in concrete visual observations. To enable
this functionality, we first curate and build two high-quality datasets,
STGR-CoT-30k for SFT and STGR-RL-36k for RL, with carefully constructed
temporal and spatial annotations, since most existing datasets offer either
temporal spans for videos or spatial boxes on images, lacking unified
spatio-temporal supervision and reasoning traces. Then, we adopt a cold-start
reinforcement learning strategy with multiple specially designed rewards that
jointly encourage answer accuracy, temporal alignment, and spatial precision.
On V-STAR benchmark, Open-o3 Video achieves state-of-the-art performance,
raising mAM by 14.4% and mLGM by 24.2% on the Qwen2.5-VL baseline. Consistent
improvements are also observed on a broad range of video understanding
benchmarks, including VideoMME, WorldSense, VideoMMMU, and TVGBench. Beyond
accuracy, the reasoning traces produced by Open-o3 Video also provide valuable
signals for test-time scaling, enabling confidence-aware verification and
improving answer reliability.

Motivation: 当前文本到图像生成模型在细粒度颜色可控性方面表现不佳，现有基准缺乏对颜色精度的系统评估，而颜色在人类视觉感知和应用中至关重要。

Result: 对流行文本到图像模型的评估显示性能差异，揭示了模型对不同颜色约定的理解程度和失败模式。

Conclusion: GenColorBench将指导精确颜色生成的改进，基准将在接受后公开。

Abstract: Recent years have seen impressive advances in text-to-image generation, with
image generative or unified models producing high-quality images from text. Yet
these models still struggle with fine-grained color controllability, often
failing to accurately match colors specified in text prompts. While existing
benchmarks evaluate compositional reasoning and prompt adherence, none
systematically assess color precision. Color is fundamental to human visual
perception and communication, critical for applications from art to design
workflows requiring brand consistency. However, current benchmarks either
neglect color or rely on coarse assessments, missing key capabilities such as
interpreting RGB values or aligning with human expectations. To this end, we
propose GenColorBench, the first comprehensive benchmark for text-to-image
color generation, grounded in color systems like ISCC-NBS and CSS3/X11,
including numerical colors which are absent elsewhere. With 44K color-focused
prompts covering 400+ colors, it reveals models' true capabilities via
perceptual and automated assessments. Evaluations of popular text-to-image
models using GenColorBench show performance variations, highlighting which
color conventions models understand best and identifying failure modes. Our
GenColorBench assessments will guide improvements in precise color generation.
The benchmark will be made public upon acceptance.

Method: 学习嵌入空间中的类别原型，引入相似性约束使原型具有代表性且类别间可分离，使用字典存储不同图像的原型以解决类别缺失问题并实现对比学习

Result: 大量实验表明该方法优于其他最先进方法

Conclusion: 基于相似性原型的框架在跨模态分割任务中表现出色

Abstract: Deep learning models have achieved great success on various vision
challenges, but a well-trained model would face drastic performance degradation
when applied to unseen data. Since the model is sensitive to domain shift,
unsupervised domain adaptation attempts to reduce the domain gap and avoid
costly annotation of unseen domains. This paper proposes a novel framework for
cross-modality segmentation via similarity-based prototypes. In specific, we
learn class-wise prototypes within an embedding space, then introduce a
similarity constraint to make these prototypes representative for each semantic
class while separable from different classes. Moreover, we use dictionaries to
store prototypes extracted from different images, which prevents the
class-missing problem and enables the contrastive learning of prototypes, and
further improves performance. Extensive experiments show that our method
achieves better results than other state-of-the-art methods.

Motivation: 解决自由移动物体从单目视频重建的挑战，特别是在缺乏可靠位姿或深度线索以及任意物体运动的情况下。

Method: 使用双键记忆模块结合潜在外观-几何键和显式方向键，通过空间引导记忆读取和高效稀疏化机制，稳健地融合当前帧特征与时间聚合的物体状态。

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效处理自由移动物体的重建问题，提供全面而紧凑的物体覆盖，且计算成本与视频序列长度无关。

Abstract: Free-moving object reconstruction from monocular video remains challenging,
particularly without reliable pose or depth cues and under arbitrary object
motion. We introduce OnlineSplatter, a novel online feed-forward framework
generating high-quality, object-centric 3D Gaussians directly from RGB frames
without requiring camera pose, depth priors, or bundle optimization. Our
approach anchors reconstruction using the first frame and progressively refines
the object representation through a dense Gaussian primitive field, maintaining
constant computational cost regardless of video sequence length. Our core
contribution is a dual-key memory module combining latent appearance-geometry
keys with explicit directional keys, robustly fusing current frame features
with temporally aggregated object states. This design enables effective
handling of free-moving objects via spatial-guided memory readout and an
efficient sparsification mechanism, ensuring comprehensive yet compact object
coverage. Evaluations on real-world datasets demonstrate that OnlineSplatter
significantly outperforms state-of-the-art pose-free reconstruction baselines,
consistently improving with more observations while maintaining constant memory

Result: 在长视频理解基准测试中，SeViCES在准确性和鲁棒性方面持续优于最先进的方法

Conclusion: 共识驱动的证据选择对视频大语言模型至关重要，SeViCES框架有效提升了长视频理解的性能

Abstract: Long video understanding remains challenging due to its complex, diverse, and
temporally scattered content. Although video large language models (Video-LLMs)
can process videos lasting tens of minutes, applying them to truly long
sequences is computationally prohibitive and often leads to unfocused or
inconsistent reasoning. A promising solution is to select only the most
informative frames, yet existing approaches typically ignore temporal
dependencies or rely on unimodal evidence, limiting their ability to provide
complete and query-relevant context. We propose a Semantic-Visual Consensus
Evidence Selection (SeViCES) framework for effective and reliable long video
understanding. SeViCES is training-free and model-agnostic, and introduces two
key components. The Semantic-Visual Consensus Frame Selection (SVCFS) module
selects frames through (1) a temporal-aware semantic branch that leverages LLM
reasoning over captions, and (2) a cluster-guided visual branch that aligns
embeddings with semantic scores via mutual information. The Answer Consensus
Refinement (ACR) module further resolves inconsistencies between semantic- and
visual-based predictions by fusing evidence and constraining the answer space.
Extensive experiments on long video understanding benchmarks show that SeViCES
consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both accuracy and
robustness, demonstrating the importance of consensus-driven evidence selection
for Video-LLMs.

Abstract: Efficient analysis and processing of dental images are crucial for dentists
to achieve accurate diagnosis and optimal treatment planning. However, dental
imaging inherently poses several challenges, such as low contrast, metallic
artifacts, and variations in projection angles. Combined with the subjectivity
arising from differences in clinicians' expertise, manual interpretation often
proves time-consuming and prone to inconsistency. Artificial intelligence
(AI)-based automated dental image analysis (DIA) offers a promising solution to
these issues and has become an integral part of computer-aided dental diagnosis
and treatment. Among various AI technologies, deep learning (DL) stands out as
the most widely applied and influential approach due to its superior feature
extraction and representation capabilities. To comprehensively summarize recent
progress in this field, we focus on the two fundamental aspects of DL
research-datasets and models. In this paper, we systematically review 260
studies on DL applications in DIA, including 49 papers on publicly available
dental datasets and 211 papers on DL-based algorithms. We first introduce the
basic concepts of dental imaging and summarize the characteristics and
acquisition methods of existing datasets. Then, we present the foundational
techniques of DL and categorize relevant models and algorithms according to
different DIA tasks, analyzing their network architectures, optimization
strategies, training methods, and performance. Furthermore, we summarize
commonly used training and evaluation metrics in the DIA domain. Finally, we
discuss the current challenges of existing research and outline potential
future directions. We hope that this work provides a valuable and systematic
reference for researchers in this field. All supplementary materials and
detailed comparison tables will be made publicly available on GitHub.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前方法在处理高分辨率、长序列3D医学影像时面临挑战：对比预训练导致视觉编码器与临床语言不对齐，切片级标记化模糊了精细解剖结构，降低了诊断性能。

Method: 提出了BTB3D因果卷积编码器-解码器，采用三阶段训练课程：局部重建、重叠窗口平铺和长上下文解码器精炼，能够从短切片片段学习并泛化到超过300个切片的扫描。

Result: 在报告生成任务中，BLEU分数提升，临床F1分数比CT2Rep、CT-CHAT和Merlin提高40%；在文本到CT合成任务中，FID降低75%，FVD减半，生成解剖一致的512*512*241体积数据。

Conclusion: 精确的三维标记化，而不仅仅是更大的语言骨干网络，对于3D医学影像中可扩展的视觉语言建模至关重要。

Abstract: Recent progress in vision-language modeling for 3D medical imaging has been
fueled by large-scale computed tomography (CT) corpora with paired free-text
reports, stronger architectures, and powerful pretrained models. This has
enabled applications such as automated report generation and text-conditioned
3D image synthesis. Yet, current approaches struggle with high-resolution,
long-sequence volumes: contrastive pretraining often yields vision encoders
that are misaligned with clinical language, and slice-wise tokenization blurs
fine anatomy, reducing diagnostic performance on downstream tasks. We introduce
BTB3D (Better Tokens for Better 3D), a causal convolutional encoder-decoder
that unifies 2D and 3D training and inference while producing compact,
frequency-aware volumetric tokens. A three-stage training curriculum enables
(i) local reconstruction, (ii) overlapping-window tiling, and (iii)
long-context decoder refinement, during which the model learns from short slice
excerpts yet generalizes to scans exceeding 300 slices without additional
memory overhead. BTB3D sets a new state-of-the-art on two key tasks: it
improves BLEU scores and increases clinical F1 by 40% over CT2Rep, CT-CHAT, and
Merlin for report generation; and it reduces FID by 75% and halves FVD compared
to GenerateCT and MedSyn for text-to-CT synthesis, producing anatomically
consistent 512*512*241 volumes. These results confirm that precise
three-dimensional tokenization, rather than larger language backbones alone, is
essential for scalable vision-language modeling in 3D medical imaging. The

TL;DR: 本文提出了UltraHR-100K数据集和频率感知后训练方法，用于解决超高分辨率文本到图像生成中的数据集缺失和细节合成问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决超高分辨率文本到图像生成的两个关键挑战：缺乏大规模高质量数据集和忽视针对UHR场景的细节合成训练策略。

Method: 1) 构建UltraHR-100K数据集（10万张3K+分辨率图像）；2) 提出频率感知后训练方法，包括细节导向时间步采样(DOTS)和软加权频率正则化(SWFR)。

Result: 在UltraHR-eval4K基准测试中，该方法显著提升了超高分辨率图像生成的细粒度细节质量和整体保真度。

Conclusion: 提出的数据集和训练策略有效解决了UHR T2I生成中的关键问题，显著改善了细节合成质量。

Abstract: Ultra-high-resolution (UHR) text-to-image (T2I) generation has seen notable
progress. However, two key challenges remain : 1) the absence of a large-scale
high-quality UHR T2I dataset, and (2) the neglect of tailored training
strategies for fine-grained detail synthesis in UHR scenarios. To tackle the
first challenge, we introduce \textbf{UltraHR-100K}, a high-quality dataset of
100K UHR images with rich captions, offering diverse content and strong visual
fidelity. Each image exceeds 3K resolution and is rigorously curated based on
detail richness, content complexity, and aesthetic quality. To tackle the
second challenge, we propose a frequency-aware post-training method that
enhances fine-detail generation in T2I diffusion models. Specifically, we
design (i) \textit{Detail-Oriented Timestep Sampling (DOTS)} to focus learning
on detail-critical denoising steps, and (ii) \textit{Soft-Weighting Frequency
Regularization (SWFR)}, which leverages Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) to
softly constrain frequency components, encouraging high-frequency detail
preservation. Extensive experiments on our proposed UltraHR-eval4K benchmarks
demonstrate that our approach significantly improves the fine-grained detail
quality and overall fidelity of UHR image generation. The code is available at

Abstract: Accurate waste classification is vital for achieving sustainable waste
management and reducing the environmental footprint of urbanization.
Misclassification of recyclable materials contributes to landfill accumulation,
inefficient recycling, and increased greenhouse gas emissions. To address these
issues, this study introduces HybridSOMSpikeNet, a hybrid deep learning
framework that integrates convolutional feature extraction, differentiable
self-organization, and spiking-inspired temporal processing to enable
intelligent and energy-efficient waste classification. The proposed model
employs a pre-trained ResNet-152 backbone to extract deep spatial
representations, followed by a Differentiable Soft Self-Organizing Map
(Soft-SOM) that enhances topological clustering and interpretability. A spiking
neural head accumulates temporal activations over discrete time steps,
improving robustness and generalization. Trained on a ten-class waste dataset,
HybridSOMSpikeNet achieved a test accuracy of 97.39%, outperforming several
state-of-the-art architectures while maintaining a lightweight computational
profile suitable for real-world deployment. Beyond its technical innovations,
the framework provides tangible environmental benefits. By enabling precise and
automated waste segregation, it supports higher recycling efficiency, reduces
contamination in recyclable streams, and minimizes the ecological and
operational costs of waste processing. The approach aligns with global
sustainability priorities, particularly the United Nations Sustainable
Development Goals (SDG 11 and SDG 12), by contributing to cleaner cities,
circular economy initiatives, and intelligent environmental management systems.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出两种技术来显著减少多比特量化网络的训练开销：权重偏置校正和比特级核心集采样策略，在保持模型性能的同时将训练时间减少高达7.88倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有多比特量化网络方法存在显著训练开销问题，因为需要为每个支持的比特宽度重复完整数据集更新，且通常需要额外的微调阶段来支持更多精度选项。

Method: 1) 权重偏置校正：通过中和跨比特宽度的量化诱导偏置并对齐激活分布，实现共享批归一化并消除微调需求；2) 比特级核心集采样策略：利用隐式知识转移现象，通过基于梯度的重要性评分选择紧凑信息子集进行训练。

Result: 在CIFAR-10/100、TinyImageNet和ImageNet-1K数据集上，使用ResNet和ViT架构的实验表明，该方法在实现竞争性或更优精度的同时，将训练时间减少高达7.88倍。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法有效解决了多比特量化网络的训练开销问题，通过权重偏置校正和比特级核心集采样策略，在保持模型性能的同时大幅提升训练效率。

Abstract: Multi-bit quantization networks enable flexible deployment of deep neural
networks by supporting multiple precision levels within a single model.
However, existing approaches suffer from significant training overhead as
full-dataset updates are repeated for each supported bit-width, resulting in a
cost that scales linearly with the number of precisions. Additionally, extra
fine-tuning stages are often required to support additional or intermediate
precision options, further compounding the overall training burden. To address
this issue, we propose two techniques that greatly reduce the training overhead
without compromising model utility: (i) Weight bias correction enables shared
batch normalization and eliminates the need for fine-tuning by neutralizing
quantization-induced bias across bit-widths and aligning activation
distributions; and (ii) Bit-wise coreset sampling strategy allows each child
model to train on a compact, informative subset selected via gradient-based
importance scores by exploiting the implicit knowledge transfer phenomenon.
Experiments on CIFAR-10/100, TinyImageNet, and ImageNet-1K with both ResNet and
ViT architectures demonstrate that our method achieves competitive or superior
accuracy while reducing training time up to 7.88x. Our code is released at

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) that integrate visual and textual
reasoning leverage chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting to tackle complex visual
tasks, yet continue to exhibit visual hallucinations and an over-reliance on
textual priors. We present a systematic diagnosis of state-of-the-art
vision-language models using a three-stage evaluation framework, uncovering key
failure modes. To address these, we propose an agent-based architecture that
combines LLM reasoning with lightweight visual modules, enabling fine-grained
analysis and iterative refinement of reasoning chains. Our results highlight
future visual reasoning models should focus on integrating a broader set of
specialized tools for analyzing visual content. Our system achieves significant
gains (+10.3 on MMMU, +6.0 on MathVista over a 7B baseline), matching or
surpassing much larger models. We will release our framework and evaluation

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MixKV是一种针对大型视觉语言模型的KV缓存压缩方法，通过结合重要性和多样性来优化压缩效果，在极端压缩条件下显著提升多模态理解性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有KV缓存压缩方法主要关注保留高重要性KV对来最小化存储，但忽视了多模态KV缓存中出现的模态特定语义冗余模式，这限制了部署可扩展性。

Method: MixKV方法分析注意力头间的语义冗余，自适应地平衡多样性和重要性来压缩KV对，而不是仅依赖重要性指标。

Result: 在极端压缩条件下（预算=64），MixKV将基线方法平均提升5.1%，在GUI接地任务上对SnapKV和AdaKV分别获得8.0%和9.0%的显著增益，同时保持相当的推理效率。

Conclusion: MixKV通过结合重要性和多样性有效解决了多模态KV缓存压缩问题，且可无缝扩展到LLMs并获得可比性能提升。

Abstract: Recent large vision-language models (LVLMs) demonstrate remarkable
capabilities in processing extended multi-modal sequences, yet the resulting
key-value (KV) cache expansion creates a critical memory bottleneck that
fundamentally limits deployment scalability. While existing KV cache
compression methods focus on retaining high-importance KV pairs to minimize
storage, they often overlook the modality-specific semantic redundancy patterns
that emerge distinctively in multi-modal KV caches. In this work, we first
analyze how, beyond simple importance, the KV cache in LVLMs exhibits varying
levels of redundancy across attention heads. We show that relying solely on
importance can only cover a subset of the full KV cache information
distribution, leading to potential loss of semantic coverage. To address this,
we propose \texttt{MixKV}, a novel method that mixes importance with diversity
for optimized KV cache compression in LVLMs. \texttt{MixKV} adapts to head-wise
semantic redundancy, selectively balancing diversity and importance when
compressing KV pairs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that \texttt{MixKV}
consistently enhances existing methods across multiple LVLMs. Under extreme
compression (budget=64), \texttt{MixKV} improves baseline methods by an average
of \textbf{5.1\%} across five multi-modal understanding benchmarks and achieves
remarkable gains of \textbf{8.0\%} and \textbf{9.0\%} for SnapKV and AdaKV on
GUI grounding tasks, all while maintaining comparable inference efficiency.
Furthermore, \texttt{MixKV} extends seamlessly to LLMs with comparable
performance gains. Our code is available at

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ALICE-LRI是一种传感器无关的方法，能够从旋转LiDAR点云生成无损距离图像，无需制造商元数据或校准文件，实现零点损失和完整点云重建。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统LiDAR投影方法存在几何不一致性，导致不可逆的信息损失，影响高保真应用。需要一种能够实现无损投影的方法来满足高精度遥感应用的需求。

Method: 通过自动逆向工程推断旋转LiDAR传感器的关键内在参数，包括激光束配置、角度分布和每束激光的校准校正，从而实现无损投影。

Result: 在KITTI和DurLAR数据集上的综合评估显示，ALICE-LRI实现了完美的点保留，所有点云中零点损失，几何精度保持在传感器精度限制内，具有实时性能。

Conclusion: ALICE-LRI从近似到无损LiDAR投影的范式转变，为需要完整几何保留的高精度遥感应用开辟了新可能性。

Abstract: 3D LiDAR sensors are essential for autonomous navigation, environmental
monitoring, and precision mapping in remote sensing applications. To
efficiently process the massive point clouds generated by these sensors, LiDAR
data is often projected into 2D range images that organize points by their
angular positions and distances. While these range image representations enable
efficient processing, conventional projection methods suffer from fundamental
geometric inconsistencies that cause irreversible information loss,
compromising high-fidelity applications. We present ALICE-LRI (Automatic LiDAR
Intrinsic Calibration Estimation for Lossless Range Images), the first general,
sensor-agnostic method that achieves lossless range image generation from
spinning LiDAR point clouds without requiring manufacturer metadata or
calibration files. Our algorithm automatically reverse-engineers the intrinsic
geometry of any spinning LiDAR sensor by inferring critical parameters
including laser beam configuration, angular distributions, and per-beam
calibration corrections, enabling lossless projection and complete point cloud
reconstruction with zero point loss. Comprehensive evaluation across the
complete KITTI and DurLAR datasets demonstrates that ALICE-LRI achieves perfect
point preservation, with zero points lost across all point clouds. Geometric
accuracy is maintained well within sensor precision limits, establishing
geometric losslessness with real-time performance. We also present a
compression case study that validates substantial downstream benefits,
demonstrating significant quality improvements in practical applications. This
paradigm shift from approximate to lossless LiDAR projections opens new
possibilities for high-precision remote sensing applications requiring complete
geometric preservation.

Conclusion: AutoScape通过几何一致的关键帧生成和插值，有效解决了长时域驾驶场景生成的几何一致性问题，显著提升了生成质量。

Abstract: This paper proposes AutoScape, a long-horizon driving scene generation
framework. At its core is a novel RGB-D diffusion model that iteratively
generates sparse, geometrically consistent keyframes, serving as reliable
anchors for the scene's appearance and geometry. To maintain long-range
geometric consistency, the model 1) jointly handles image and depth in a shared
latent space, 2) explicitly conditions on the existing scene geometry (i.e.,
rendered point clouds) from previously generated keyframes, and 3) steers the
sampling process with a warp-consistent guidance. Given high-quality RGB-D
keyframes, a video diffusion model then interpolates between them to produce
dense and coherent video frames. AutoScape generates realistic and
geometrically consistent driving videos of over 20 seconds, improving the
long-horizon FID and FVD scores over the prior state-of-the-art by 48.6\% and
43.0\%, respectively.

TL;DR: DyPE是一种无需训练的方法，通过动态调整位置编码来扩展扩散变换器的生成分辨率，使其能够生成远超训练分辨率的图像。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散变换器在高分辨率图像生成时，由于自注意力机制的二次方计算复杂度，训练成本极高。需要一种方法能够在无需重新训练的情况下扩展预训练模型的生成分辨率。

Method: DyPE利用扩散过程的频谱特性，在每一步扩散过程中动态调整位置编码的频率谱，使其与当前生成阶段匹配。低频率结构在早期收敛，高频率细节需要更多步骤来解析。

Result: DyPE能够显著扩展生成分辨率，例如使用FLUX生成1600万像素的图像。在多个基准测试中，DyPE持续提升性能，在超高分辨率图像生成方面达到最先进的保真度，且分辨率越高优势越明显。

Conclusion: DyPE提供了一种高效、无需训练的方法来扩展扩散变换器的生成能力，解决了超高分辨率图像生成的扩展性问题，且不增加采样成本。

Abstract: Diffusion Transformer models can generate images with remarkable fidelity and
detail, yet training them at ultra-high resolutions remains extremely costly
due to the self-attention mechanism's quadratic scaling with the number of
image tokens. In this paper, we introduce Dynamic Position Extrapolation
(DyPE), a novel, training-free method that enables pre-trained diffusion
transformers to synthesize images at resolutions far beyond their training
data, with no additional sampling cost. DyPE takes advantage of the spectral
progression inherent to the diffusion process, where low-frequency structures
converge early, while high-frequencies take more steps to resolve.
Specifically, DyPE dynamically adjusts the model's positional encoding at each
diffusion step, matching their frequency spectrum with the current stage of the
generative process. This approach allows us to generate images at resolutions
that exceed the training resolution dramatically, e.g., 16 million pixels using
FLUX. On multiple benchmarks, DyPE consistently improves performance and
achieves state-of-the-art fidelity in ultra-high-resolution image generation,
with gains becoming even more pronounced at higher resolutions. Project page is

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 发现MeanFlow目标自然分解为轨迹流匹配和轨迹一致性两个部分，这两个术语存在强烈的负相关性，导致优化冲突和收敛缓慢。

Method: 提出α-Flow目标家族，统一了轨迹流匹配、Shortcut Model和MeanFlow，采用课程学习策略平滑地从轨迹流匹配过渡到MeanFlow。

Result: 在ImageNet-1K 256x256上，α-Flow始终优于MeanFlow，最大的α-Flow-XL/2+模型使用vanilla DiT主干取得了FID 2.58(1-NFE)和2.15(2-NFE)的SOTA结果。

Conclusion: α-Flow通过解耦冲突目标实现了更好的收敛性能，为少步生成建模提供了有效的训练框架。

Abstract: MeanFlow has recently emerged as a powerful framework for few-step generative
modeling trained from scratch, but its success is not yet fully understood. In
this work, we show that the MeanFlow objective naturally decomposes into two
parts: trajectory flow matching and trajectory consistency. Through gradient
analysis, we find that these terms are strongly negatively correlated, causing
optimization conflict and slow convergence. Motivated by these insights, we
introduce $\alpha$-Flow, a broad family of objectives that unifies trajectory
flow matching, Shortcut Model, and MeanFlow under one formulation. By adopting
a curriculum strategy that smoothly anneals from trajectory flow matching to
MeanFlow, $\alpha$-Flow disentangles the conflicting objectives, and achieves
better convergence. When trained from scratch on class-conditional ImageNet-1K
256x256 with vanilla DiT backbones, $\alpha$-Flow consistently outperforms
MeanFlow across scales and settings. Our largest $\alpha$-Flow-XL/2+ model
achieves new state-of-the-art results using vanilla DiT backbones, with FID
scores of 2.58 (1-NFE) and 2.15 (2-NFE).

Motivation: 从单张2D图像准确推断相机姿态、3D形状和纹理是计算机视觉中的关键挑战，现有方法在姿态估计和形状重建的联合优化方面存在局限。

Method: 将3D重建建模为条件采样过程，采用两阶段流匹配：粗阶段生成初始3D几何和2D投影用于姿态恢复，精阶段集成姿态对齐图像特征以增强结构保真度和外观细节。

Result: 在PSNR指标上获得超过3dB的提升，Chamfer距离减少超过10%，在姿态精度上与单目估计器相当，视觉保真度优于基线3D生成模型。

Conclusion: Cupid通过统一的生成框架实现了鲁棒的姿态和形状估计，在3D重建任务中表现出色，为单图像3D重建提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: This work proposes a new generation-based 3D reconstruction method, named
Cupid, that accurately infers the camera pose, 3D shape, and texture of an
object from a single 2D image. Cupid casts 3D reconstruction as a conditional
sampling process from a learned distribution of 3D objects, and it jointly
generates voxels and pixel-voxel correspondences, enabling robust pose and
shape estimation under a unified generative framework. By representing both
input camera poses and 3D shape as a distribution in a shared 3D latent space,
Cupid adopts a two-stage flow matching pipeline: (1) a coarse stage that
produces initial 3D geometry with associated 2D projections for pose recovery;
and (2) a refinement stage that integrates pose-aligned image features to
enhance structural fidelity and appearance details. Extensive experiments
demonstrate Cupid outperforms leading 3D reconstruction methods with an over 3
dB PSNR gain and an over 10% Chamfer Distance reduction, while matching
monocular estimators on pose accuracy and delivering superior visual fidelity
over baseline 3D generative models. For an immersive view of the 3D results

Motivation: 现有研究往往低估雷达的作用，仅将其作为辅助传感器，而雷达实际上能够提供目标在世界3D坐标系中的精确距离/深度信息。本文旨在充分发挥雷达的关键作用。

Method: 开发了雷达-相机融合MOT框架，利用在线雷达-相机校准简化传感器检测结果集成；使用雷达和相机数据的共同特征准确推导检测对象的真实世界位置；采用特征匹配和类别一致性检查来超越单纯位置匹配的限制。

Result: 在受控环境和实际交通场景中的实验证明，该框架能够简化雷达-相机映射过程并提高跟踪精度。

Abstract: This paper presents a Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) framework that fuses radar
and camera data to enhance tracking efficiency while minimizing manual
interventions. Contrary to many studies that underutilize radar and assign it a
supplementary role--despite its capability to provide accurate range/depth
information of targets in a world 3D coordinate system--our approach positions
radar in a crucial role. Meanwhile, this paper utilizes common features to
enable online calibration to autonomously associate detections from radar and
camera. The main contributions of this work include: (1) the development of a
radar-camera fusion MOT framework that exploits online radar-camera calibration
to simplify the integration of detection results from these two sensors, (2)
the utilization of common features between radar and camera data to accurately
derive real-world positions of detected objects, and (3) the adoption of
feature matching and category-consistency checking to surpass the limitations
of mere position matching in enhancing sensor association accuracy. To the best
of our knowledge, we are the first to investigate the integration of
radar-camera common features and their use in online calibration for achieving
MOT. The efficacy of our framework is demonstrated by its ability to streamline
the radar-camera mapping process and improve tracking precision, as evidenced
by real-world experiments conducted in both controlled environments and actual
traffic scenarios. Code is available at

Conclusion: ARGenSeg通过图像生成范式成功统一了多模态理解和像素级感知，在分割精度和推理效率方面均取得显著提升。

Abstract: We propose a novel AutoRegressive Generation-based paradigm for image
Segmentation (ARGenSeg), achieving multimodal understanding and pixel-level
perception within a unified framework. Prior works integrating image
segmentation into multimodal large language models (MLLMs) typically employ
either boundary points representation or dedicated segmentation heads. These
methods rely on discrete representations or semantic prompts fed into
task-specific decoders, which limits the ability of the MLLM to capture
fine-grained visual details. To address these challenges, we introduce a
segmentation framework for MLLM based on image generation, which naturally
produces dense masks for target objects. We leverage MLLM to output visual
tokens and detokenize them into images using an universal VQ-VAE, making the
segmentation fully dependent on the pixel-level understanding of the MLLM. To
reduce inference latency, we employ a next-scale-prediction strategy to
generate required visual tokens in parallel. Extensive experiments demonstrate
that our method surpasses prior state-of-the-art approaches on multiple

TL;DR: 提出了一个基于纯transformer的自回归视频预测模型，通过连续像素空间表示和时空自注意力布局，在物理模拟数据集上实现了更长时间范围的准确预测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 受自回归大语言模型性能和可扩展性的启发，将transformer架构应用于视频预测领域，专注于解决现有视频生成方法在物理模拟时间建模方面的不足。

Method: 使用简单的端到端纯transformer模型，比较不同的时空自注意力布局，采用连续像素空间表示进行视频预测，无需复杂的训练策略或潜在特征学习组件。

Result: 与现有潜在空间方法相比，物理准确预测的时间范围延长了50%，同时在常见视频质量指标上保持相当性能；通过可解释性实验发现网络能够准确估计PDE模拟参数。

Conclusion: 该工作为基于注意力的时空视频建模提供了一个简单、参数高效且可解释的平台，能够泛化到分布外模拟参数的估计。

Abstract: Inspired by the performance and scalability of autoregressive large language
models (LLMs), transformer-based models have seen recent success in the visual
domain. This study investigates a transformer adaptation for video prediction
with a simple end-to-end approach, comparing various spatiotemporal
self-attention layouts. Focusing on causal modeling of physical simulations
over time; a common shortcoming of existing video-generative approaches, we
attempt to isolate spatiotemporal reasoning via physical object tracking
metrics and unsupervised training on physical simulation datasets. We introduce
a simple yet effective pure transformer model for autoregressive video
prediction, utilizing continuous pixel-space representations for video
prediction. Without the need for complex training strategies or latent
feature-learning components, our approach significantly extends the time
horizon for physically accurate predictions by up to 50% when compared with
existing latent-space approaches, while maintaining comparable performance on
common video quality metrics. In addition, we conduct interpretability
experiments to identify network regions that encode information useful to
perform accurate estimations of PDE simulation parameters via probing models,
and find that this generalizes to the estimation of out-of-distribution
simulation parameters. This work serves as a platform for further
attention-based spatiotemporal modeling of videos via a simple, parameter
efficient, and interpretable approach.

*Yuhan Liu,Lianhui Qin,Shengjie Wang*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为Speculative Verdict (SV)的训练免费框架，通过结合多个轻量级草稿专家和大型裁决模型，解决信息密集型图像中密集文本与图形元素交织的推理挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型在处理信息密集型图像时面临挑战，这些图像密集交织文本注释与细粒度图形元素，主要困难在于精确定位关键线索和整合分散证据的多跳推理。

Method: SV框架采用推测解码思想，包含草稿阶段和裁决阶段。草稿阶段由小型VLMs作为草稿专家生成多样化定位候选的推理路径；裁决阶段由强大VLM综合这些路径生成最终答案。还引入了共识专家选择机制，仅转发高一致性推理路径。

Result: 在具有挑战性的信息密集和高分辨率视觉问答基准测试（包括InfographicVQA、ChartMuseum、ChartQAPro和HR-Bench 4K）上取得了持续增益。

Conclusion: 通过综合多个部分准确推理路径中的正确见解，SV相比大型专有模型或训练流程，实现了错误校正和成本效率的双重优势。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in
multimodal understanding, yet they struggle when reasoning over
information-intensive images that densely interleave textual annotations with
fine-grained graphical elements. The main challenges lie in precisely
localizing critical cues in dense layouts and multi-hop reasoning to integrate
dispersed evidence. We propose Speculative Verdict (SV), a training-free
framework inspired by speculative decoding that combines multiple lightweight
draft experts with a large verdict model. In the draft stage, small VLMs act as
draft experts to generate reasoning paths that provide diverse localization
candidates; in the verdict stage, a strong VLM synthesizes these paths to
produce the final answer, minimizing computational cost while recovering
correct answers. To further improve efficiency and accuracy, SV introduces a
consensus expert selection mechanism that forwards only high-agreement
reasoning paths to the verdict. Empirically, SV achieves consistent gains on
challenging information-intensive and high-resolution visual question answering
benchmarks, including InfographicVQA, ChartMuseum, ChartQAPro, and HR-Bench 4K.
By synthesizing correct insights from multiple partially accurate reasoning
paths, SV achieves both error correction and cost-efficiency compared to large
proprietary models or training pipelines. Code is available at

### [82] [SpectraMorph: Structured Latent Learning for Self-Supervised Hyperspectral Super-Resolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20814)
*Ritik Shah,Marco F Duarte*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为SpectraMorph的物理引导自监督融合框架，通过解混瓶颈实现高光谱和低空间分辨率图像的超分辨率，具有可解释性强、训练快速的特点，在单波段MSI下仍保持鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 高光谱传感器空间分辨率低导致边界模糊和混合像素问题，现有深度学习方法缺乏可解释性且在MSI波段很少时容易失败。

Method: 采用解混瓶颈结构：从低分辨率HSI提取端元特征，用紧凑多层感知机从MSI预测丰度图，通过线性混合重建光谱，以自监督方式通过MSI传感器光谱响应函数进行训练。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上，SpectraMorph持续优于最先进的无监督/自监督基线方法，与有监督基线方法相比也很有竞争力。

Conclusion: SpectraMorph框架产生可解释的中间结果，训练时间不到一分钟，即使在单波段MSI情况下仍保持鲁棒性，为高光谱超分辨率提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Hyperspectral sensors capture dense spectra per pixel but suffer from low
spatial resolution, causing blurred boundaries and mixed-pixel effects.
Co-registered companion sensors such as multispectral, RGB, or panchromatic
cameras provide high-resolution spatial detail, motivating hyperspectral
super-resolution through the fusion of hyperspectral and multispectral images
(HSI-MSI). Existing deep learning based methods achieve strong performance but
rely on opaque regressors that lack interpretability and often fail when the
MSI has very few bands. We propose SpectraMorph, a physics-guided
self-supervised fusion framework with a structured latent space. Instead of
direct regression, SpectraMorph enforces an unmixing bottleneck: endmember
signatures are extracted from the low-resolution HSI, and a compact multilayer
perceptron predicts abundance-like maps from the MSI. Spectra are reconstructed
by linear mixing, with training performed in a self-supervised manner via the
MSI sensor's spectral response function. SpectraMorph produces interpretable
intermediates, trains in under a minute, and remains robust even with a
single-band (pan-chromatic) MSI. Experiments on synthetic and real-world
datasets show SpectraMorph consistently outperforming state-of-the-art
unsupervised/self-supervised baselines while remaining very competitive against
supervised baselines.

TL;DR: 提出LDDBM框架，这是一个基于潜在变量扩展的通用模态转换方法，能够在共享潜在空间中学习任意模态之间的转换，无需对齐维度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 扩散模型在单模态领域表现出色，但在跨模态转换方面仍面临挑战。现有方法存在维度共享、高斯先验和模态特定架构等限制，缺乏通用性和理论基础。

Method: 使用潜在去噪扩散桥模型，在共享潜在空间中学习模态转换；引入对比对齐损失确保语义一致性；设计域无关的编码器-解码器架构；提出预测损失指导训练；探索多种训练策略提高稳定性。

Result: 在多种模态转换任务上表现优异，包括多视角到3D形状生成、图像超分辨率和多视角场景合成。综合实验验证了框架的有效性。

Conclusion: LDDBM为通用模态转换建立了新的强基准，支持任意模态对的转换，具有广泛的应用潜力。

Abstract: Recent advances in generative modeling have positioned diffusion models as
state-of-the-art tools for sampling from complex data distributions. While
these models have shown remarkable success across single-modality domains such
as images and audio, extending their capabilities to Modality Translation (MT),
translating information across different sensory modalities, remains an open
challenge. Existing approaches often rely on restrictive assumptions, including
shared dimensionality, Gaussian source priors, and modality-specific
architectures, which limit their generality and theoretical grounding. In this
work, we propose the Latent Denoising Diffusion Bridge Model (LDDBM), a
general-purpose framework for modality translation based on a latent-variable
extension of Denoising Diffusion Bridge Models. By operating in a shared latent
space, our method learns a bridge between arbitrary modalities without
requiring aligned dimensions. We introduce a contrastive alignment loss to
enforce semantic consistency between paired samples and design a
domain-agnostic encoder-decoder architecture tailored for noise prediction in
latent space. Additionally, we propose a predictive loss to guide training
toward accurate cross-domain translation and explore several training
strategies to improve stability. Our approach supports arbitrary modality pairs
and performs strongly on diverse MT tasks, including multi-view to 3D shape
generation, image super-resolution, and multi-view scene synthesis.
Comprehensive experiments and ablations validate the effectiveness of our
framework, establishing a new strong baseline in general modality translation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: LayerComposer是一个交互式多主体个性化文本到图像生成框架，通过分层画布和锁定机制实现空间组合控制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有个性化生成模型缺乏空间组合的交互控制，且难以扩展到多个主体。

Method: 提出分层画布表示和锁定机制，每个主体放在独立层中，通过位置嵌入和互补数据采样实现高保真度。

Result: 在多个主体个性化图像生成中，相比最先进方法实现了更优越的空间控制和身份保持。

Conclusion: LayerComposer通过直观的图层操作提供了专业的图像编辑体验，无需架构改动即可实现高质量的多主体生成。

Abstract: Despite their impressive visual fidelity, existing personalized generative
models lack interactive control over spatial composition and scale poorly to
multiple subjects. To address these limitations, we present LayerComposer, an
interactive framework for personalized, multi-subject text-to-image generation.
Our approach introduces two main contributions: (1) a layered canvas, a novel
representation in which each subject is placed on a distinct layer, enabling
occlusion-free composition; and (2) a locking mechanism that preserves selected
layers with high fidelity while allowing the remaining layers to adapt flexibly
to the surrounding context. Similar to professional image-editing software, the
proposed layered canvas allows users to place, resize, or lock input subjects
through intuitive layer manipulation. Our versatile locking mechanism requires
no architectural changes, relying instead on inherent positional embeddings
combined with a new complementary data sampling strategy. Extensive experiments
demonstrate that LayerComposer achieves superior spatial control and identity
preservation compared to the state-of-the-art methods in multi-subject
personalized image generation.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: HoloCine是一个文本到视频生成模型，能够生成具有全局一致性的多镜头叙事场景，解决了现有模型在叙事连贯性方面的不足。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文本到视频模型擅长生成孤立片段，但在创建连贯的多镜头叙事方面存在不足，这限制了真正的故事讲述能力。

Method: 采用窗口交叉注意力机制将文本提示定位到特定镜头，以及稀疏镜头间自注意力模式（镜头内密集，镜头间稀疏），确保分钟级生成的效率。

Result: 在叙事连贯性方面达到新的最先进水平，并展现出对角色和场景的持久记忆能力以及对电影技术的直观理解等新兴能力。

Conclusion: 这项工作标志着从片段合成向自动化电影制作的关键转变，使端到端的电影创作成为可实现的未来。

Abstract: State-of-the-art text-to-video models excel at generating isolated clips but
fall short of creating the coherent, multi-shot narratives, which are the
essence of storytelling. We bridge this "narrative gap" with HoloCine, a model
that generates entire scenes holistically to ensure global consistency from the
first shot to the last. Our architecture achieves precise directorial control
through a Window Cross-Attention mechanism that localizes text prompts to
specific shots, while a Sparse Inter-Shot Self-Attention pattern (dense within
shots but sparse between them) ensures the efficiency required for minute-scale
generation. Beyond setting a new state-of-the-art in narrative coherence,
HoloCine develops remarkable emergent abilities: a persistent memory for
characters and scenes, and an intuitive grasp of cinematic techniques. Our work
marks a pivotal shift from clip synthesis towards automated filmmaking, making
end-to-end cinematic creation a tangible future. Our code is available at:

TL;DR: 提出了一种结合大型语言模型(LLMs)、向量数据库和检索增强生成(RAG)的新方法，用于分类早期现代宗教图像，显著优于传统图像和关键词搜索方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决早期现代宗教图像分类的挑战，传统图像和关键词搜索方法在准确性和效率上存在局限，需要更有效的跨学科方法来处理大规模视觉档案。

Method: 利用神圣罗马帝国书籍插图的整页上下文，通过LLM生成包含视觉和文本元素的详细描述，然后通过混合向量搜索匹配相关的Iconclass代码。

Result: 在五个和四个分类级别上分别达到87%和92%的精确度，显著优于传统图像和关键词搜索方法。

Conclusion: 该方法展示了LLMs和RAG在艺术史和数字人文学科研究中的巨大潜力，为大规模早期现代视觉档案分析提供了强大工具。

Abstract: This paper presents a novel methodology for classifying early modern
religious images by using Large Language Models (LLMs) and vector databases in
combination with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). The approach leverages
the full-page context of book illustrations from the Holy Roman Empire,
allowing the LLM to generate detailed descriptions that incorporate both visual
and textual elements. These descriptions are then matched to relevant Iconclass
codes through a hybrid vector search. This method achieves 87% and 92%
precision at five and four levels of classification, significantly
outperforming traditional image and keyword-based searches. By employing
full-page descriptions and RAG, the system enhances classification accuracy,
offering a powerful tool for large-scale analysis of early modern visual
archives. This interdisciplinary approach demonstrates the growing potential of
LLMs and RAG in advancing research within art history and digital humanities.

TL;DR: 提出了ConvRec-R1框架，通过两阶段训练解决LLM在推荐系统中的问题：第一阶段使用Remap-Reflect-Adjust管道构建行为克隆数据集，第二阶段提出Rank-GRPO算法优化排名输出。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有LLM在推荐任务中存在生成目录外物品、违反输出格式、排名质量下降等问题，需要专门的对齐方法。

Method: 两阶段框架：第一阶段使用Remap-Reflect-Adjust管道从黑盒LLM生成高质量演示数据；第二阶段提出Rank-GRPO算法，将排名而非token作为优化单位，重新定义奖励函数并引入基于几何平均的排名级重要性比率。

Result: 在Reddit-v2数据集上，ConvRec-R1比GRPO基线收敛更快，Recall和NDCG指标更高。

Conclusion: ConvRec-R1框架有效解决了LLM在推荐系统中的对齐问题，Rank-GRPO算法在排名任务中表现优于传统方法。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are reshaping the recommender system paradigm by
enabling users to express preferences and receive recommendations through
conversations. Yet, aligning LLMs to the recommendation task remains
challenging: pretrained LLMs often generate out-of-catalog items, violate
required output formats, and their ranking quality degrades sharply toward the
end of the generated list. To this end, we propose ConvRec-R1, a two-stage
framework for end-to-end training of LLM-based conversational recommender
systems. In Stage 1, we construct a behavioral-cloning dataset with a
Remap-Reflect-Adjust pipeline, which produces high-quality, catalog-grounded
demonstrations from powerful blackbox LLMs to warm-start the RL training. In
Stage 2, we propose Rank-GRPO, a principled extension of group relative policy
optimization (GRPO) tailored to tasks with rank-style outputs. Rank-GRPO treats
each rank in the recommendation list as the unit instead of token (too
fine-grained) or sequence (too coarse), redefining rewards to remove non-causal
credit assignment and introducing a rank-level importance ratio based on the
geometric mean of rank-wise token probabilities to stabilize policy updates.
Experiments on the public Reddit-v2 dataset show that ConvRec-R1 converges
faster and achieves higher Recall and NDCG than GRPO-style baselines. Code and
datasets are released at https://github.com/yaochenzhu/Rank-GRPO.

Motivation: LLM推荐系统面临用户兴趣和内容动态变化的挑战，初始微调无法捕捉实时变化，需要有效的更新机制来保持系统性能。

Conclusion: 混合更新策略结合了定期微调的长期知识适应性和低成本RAG的敏捷性，为维护高质量LLM推荐系统提供了实用且经济高效的框架。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) empower recommendation systems through their
advanced reasoning and planning capabilities. However, the dynamic nature of
user interests and content poses a significant challenge: While initial
fine-tuning aligns LLMs with domain knowledge and user preferences, it fails to
capture such real-time changes, necessitating robust update mechanisms. This
paper investigates strategies for updating LLM-powered recommenders, focusing
on the trade-offs between ongoing fine-tuning and Retrieval-Augmented
Generation (RAG). Using an LLM-powered user interest exploration system as a
case study, we perform a comparative analysis of these methods across
dimensions like cost, agility, and knowledge incorporation. We propose a hybrid
update strategy that leverages the long-term knowledge adaptation of periodic
fine-tuning with the agility of low-cost RAG. We demonstrate through live A/B
experiments on a billion-user platform that this hybrid approach yields
statistically significant improvements in user satisfaction, offering a
practical and cost-effective framework for maintaining high-quality LLM-powered
recommender systems.

Method: 采用基于内容块的音乐AI代理架构，通过块级检索和代理编排，将音乐组织为细粒度组件存储在BlockDB中，每个使用触发归属层事件以实现透明来源和实时结算。

Conclusion: 该系统指向后流媒体范式，使音乐从静态目录转变为协作和适应性生态系统，实现透明归属和公平经济模型。

Abstract: Generative AI is reshaping music creation, but its rapid growth exposes
structural gaps in attribution, rights management, and economic models. Unlike
past media shifts, from live performance to recordings, downloads, and
streaming, AI transforms the entire lifecycle of music, collapsing boundaries
between creation, distribution, and monetization. However, existing streaming
systems, with opaque and concentrated royalty flows, are ill-equipped to handle
the scale and complexity of AI-driven production. We propose a content-based
Music AI Agent architecture that embeds attribution directly into the creative
workflow through block-level retrieval and agentic orchestration. Designed for
iterative, session-based interaction, the system organizes music into granular
components (Blocks) stored in BlockDB; each use triggers an Attribution Layer
event for transparent provenance and real-time settlement. This framework
reframes AI from a generative tool into infrastructure for a Fair AI Media
Platform. By enabling fine-grained attribution, equitable compensation, and
participatory engagement, it points toward a post-streaming paradigm where
music functions not as a static catalog but as a collaborative and adaptive
ecosystem.

<details>

Motivation: 现有方法通过学习的嵌入或相对注意力偏置来注入时间信息，但RoPE方法如果设计得当，可以成为建模用户行为序列中时间和顺序信息的更强替代方案。

Method: 提出了TO-RoPE系列旋转位置嵌入设计，将索引和时间作为角度源直接塑造查询-键几何关系，包括早期融合、按维度分割和按头分割三种实现方式。

Result: 在公开数据集和工业数据集上的广泛实验表明，TO-RoPE变体在编码时间和索引方面始终优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 旋转嵌入为生成式推荐提供了一个简单、有原则且易于部署的基础框架。

Abstract: Generative recommenders, typically transformer-based autoregressive models,
predict the next item or action from a user's interaction history. Their
effectiveness depends on how the model represents where an interaction event
occurs in the sequence (discrete index) and when it occurred in wall-clock
time. Prevailing approaches inject time via learned embeddings or relative
attention biases. In this paper, we argue that RoPE-based approaches, if
designed properly, can be a stronger alternative for jointly modeling temporal
and sequential information in user behavior sequences. While vanilla RoPE in
LLMs considers only token order, generative recommendation requires
incorporating both event time and token index. To address this, we propose
Time-and-Order RoPE (TO-RoPE), a family of rotary position embedding designs
that treat index and time as angle sources shaping the query-key geometry
directly. We present three instantiations: early fusion, split-by-dim, and
split-by-head. Extensive experiments on both publicly available datasets and a
proprietary industrial dataset show that TO-RoPE variants consistently improve
accuracy over existing methods for encoding time and index. These results
position rotary embeddings as a simple, principled, and deployment-friendly
foundation for generative recommendation.

tasks: Query-Category (QC) Relevance, which evaluates how well a user's search
query aligns with a product category, and Query-Item (QI) Relevance, which
measures the match between a multilingual search query and an individual

Gemma-3 12B and Qwen-2.5 14B model for both tasks using multiple strategies.
The Gemma-3 12B (4-bit) model achieved the best QC performance using original

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管大语言模型具有强大的推理能力，但难以原生作为生成式推理推荐模型，主要挑战在于文本语义与协同过滤信号之间的建模差距，以及用户反馈的稀疏性和随机性。

Method: 提出GREAM框架，包含三个组件：协同语义对齐（构建语义一致的离散项目索引）、推理课程激活（构建带显式思维链监督的合成数据集）、稀疏正则化组策略优化（通过可验证奖励稳定后训练）。

Result: 在三个数据集上的实验表明，GREAM相比强基线模型取得了持续的性能提升。

Conclusion: GREAM为构建可验证强化学习驱动的LLM推荐系统提供了一条实用路径，支持两种互补的推理模式：直接序列推荐和顺序推理推荐。

Abstract: Despite their remarkable reasoning capabilities across diverse domains, large
language models (LLMs) face fundamental challenges in natively functioning as
generative reasoning recommendation models (GRRMs), where the intrinsic
modeling gap between textual semantics and collaborative filtering signals,
combined with the sparsity and stochasticity of user feedback, presents
significant obstacles. This work explores how to build GRRMs by adapting
pre-trained LLMs, which achieves a unified understanding-reasoning-prediction
manner for recommendation tasks. We propose GREAM, an end-to-end framework that
integrates three components: (i) Collaborative-Semantic Alignment, which fuses
heterogeneous textual evidence to construct semantically consistent, discrete
item indices and auxiliary alignment tasks that ground linguistic
representations in interaction semantics; (ii) Reasoning Curriculum Activation,
which builds a synthetic dataset with explicit Chain-of-Thought supervision and
a curriculum that progresses through behavioral evidence extraction, latent
preference modeling, intent inference, recommendation formulation, and denoised
sequence rewriting; and (iii) Sparse-Regularized Group Policy Optimization
(SRPO), which stabilizes post-training via Residual-Sensitive Verifiable Reward
and Bonus-Calibrated Group Advantage Estimation, enabling end-to-end
optimization under verifiable signals despite sparse successes. GREAM natively
supports two complementary inference modes: Direct Sequence Recommendation for
high-throughput, low-latency deployment, and Sequential Reasoning
Recommendation that first emits an interpretable reasoning chain for causal
transparency. Experiments on three datasets demonstrate consistent gains over
strong baselines, providing a practical path toward verifiable-RL-driven LLM
recommenders.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: FINDER是一个用于分析噪声数据集的分类框架，通过随机特征和KLE分解来处理低信噪比、小样本等挑战性问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 噪声数据集（低信噪比、小样本、数据收集错误等）是分类方法的重要研究前沿，具有理论和实践意义。

Method: 将经验数据集视为随机场的实现，映射到希尔伯特空间构造随机特征，使用KLE分解为可计算不可约分量，通过特征分解进行分类。

Result: 在阿尔茨海默病阶段分类和遥感森林砍伐检测等数据稀缺领域取得了最先进的突破。

Conclusion: 讨论了FINDER优于现有方法的情况、失败模式和局限性。

Abstract: ''Noisy'' datasets (regimes with low signal to noise ratios, small sample
sizes, faulty data collection, etc) remain a key research frontier for
classification methods with both theoretical and practical implications. We
introduce FINDER, a rigorous framework for analyzing generic classification
problems, with tailored algorithms for noisy datasets. FINDER incorporates
fundamental stochastic analysis ideas into the feature learning and inference
stages to optimally account for the randomness inherent to all empirical
datasets. We construct ''stochastic features'' by first viewing empirical
datasets as realizations from an underlying random field (without assumptions
on its exact distribution) and then mapping them to appropriate Hilbert spaces.
The Kosambi-Karhunen-Lo\'eve expansion (KLE) breaks these stochastic features
into computable irreducible components, which allow classification over noisy
datasets via an eigen-decomposition: data from different classes resides in
distinct regions, identified by analyzing the spectrum of the associated
operators. We validate FINDER on several challenging, data-deficient scientific
domains, producing state of the art breakthroughs in: (i) Alzheimer's Disease
stage classification, (ii) Remote sensing detection of deforestation. We end
with a discussion on when FINDER is expected to outperform existing methods,
its failure modes, and other limitations.

### [95] [Some Attention is All You Need for Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19861)
*Felix Michalak,Steven Abreu*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 在混合SSM-Transformer架构中，检索功能完全由自注意力层负责，SSM层无法补偿注意力层的缺失。仅保留15%的注意力头即可维持近乎完美的检索性能，同时保留84%的MMLU表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探究混合SSM-Transformer架构中不同组件的功能专门化程度，特别是自注意力层和SSM层在检索任务中的具体作用。

Method: 通过对RecurrentGemma-2B/9B和Jamba-Mini-1.6模型进行注意力消融实验，分析不同组件在检索任务中的表现，并测试稀疏化注意力头对性能的影响。

Result: 注意力消融导致检索任务完全失败（0%准确率），而SSM层没有补偿机制。仅保留15%的注意力头即可维持近乎完美的检索性能，同时保留84%的MMLU表现。检索需要针标记在生成过程中暴露，并在预填充或生成阶段有足够的上下文。

Conclusion: 混合架构表现出严格的功能专门化，自注意力层专门负责检索任务，这些模型更像是专门化模块的集合而非集成系统，这对架构优化和可解释性有重要影响。

Abstract: We demonstrate complete functional segregation in hybrid SSM-Transformer
architectures: retrieval depends exclusively on self-attention layers. Across
RecurrentGemma-2B/9B and Jamba-Mini-1.6, attention ablation causes catastrophic
retrieval failure (0% accuracy), while SSM layers show no compensatory
mechanisms even with improved prompting. Conversely, sparsifying attention to
just 15% of heads maintains near-perfect retrieval while preserving 84% MMLU
performance, suggesting self-attention specializes primarily for retrieval
tasks. We identify precise mechanistic requirements for retrieval: needle
tokens must be exposed during generation and sufficient context must be
available during prefill or generation. This strict functional specialization
challenges assumptions about redundancy in hybrid architectures and suggests
these models operate as specialized modules rather than integrated systems,
with immediate implications for architecture optimization and interpretability.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出Fair-SMW算法，通过拉格朗日方法和SMW恒等式重新形式化约束优化问题，在保持公平性的同时显著提升谱聚类算法的计算效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有谱聚类算法在融入群体公平性约束时计算效率较低，需要改进其计算性能。

Method: 使用拉格朗日方法和Sherman-Morrison-Woodbury恒等式重新形式化约束优化问题，开发Fair-SMW算法，并采用三种具有不同谱间隙的拉普拉斯矩阵变体。

Result: 在LastFM、FacebookNet、Deezer和German等真实网络数据集上测试，计算时间比现有最优方法快两倍，同时能够实现两倍的平衡度。

Conclusion: Fair-SMW算法在保持公平聚类质量的同时，显著提升了计算效率，为公平聚类提供了高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent research has focused on mitigating algorithmic bias in clustering by
incorporating fairness constraints into algorithmic design. Notions such as
disparate impact, community cohesion, and cost per population have been
implemented to enforce equitable outcomes. Among these, group fairness
(balance) ensures that each protected group is proportionally represented
within every cluster. However, incorporating balance as a metric of fairness
into spectral clustering algorithms has led to computational times that can be
improved. This study aims to enhance the efficiency of spectral clustering
algorithms by reformulating the constrained optimization problem using a new
formulation derived from the Lagrangian method and the
Sherman-Morrison-Woodbury (SMW) identity, resulting in the Fair-SMW algorithm.
Fair-SMW employs three alternatives to the Laplacian matrix with different
spectral gaps to generate multiple variations of Fair-SMW, achieving clustering
solutions with comparable balance to existing algorithms while offering
improved runtime performance. We present the results of Fair-SMW, evaluated
using the Stochastic Block Model (SBM) to measure both runtime efficiency and
balance across real-world network datasets, including LastFM, FacebookNet,
Deezer, and German. We achieve an improvement in computation time that is twice
as fast as the state-of-the-art, and also flexible enough to achieve twice as
much balance.

TL;DR: NAS-DQN通过在线神经架构搜索实现动态网络重构，在深度强化学习中超越固定架构设计，获得更好的最终性能、样本效率和策略稳定性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统深度强化学习代理的性能受限于固定的神经网络架构，需要通过昂贵的超参数搜索来确定，这限制了代理的适应性和性能。

Method: 提出NAS-DQN，将学习型神经架构搜索控制器集成到DRL训练循环中，基于累积性能反馈实现动态网络重构。

Result: NAS-DQN在连续控制任务中优于三个固定架构基线和随机搜索控制，实现了更优的最终性能、样本效率和策略稳定性，且计算开销可忽略。

Conclusion: 架构自适应不仅是有益的，而且是实现在线深度强化学习最优样本效率的必要条件，RL代理的设计可以无缝集成为学习过程的动态组成部分。

Abstract: The performance of deep reinforcement learning agents is fundamentally
constrained by their neural network architecture, a choice traditionally made
through expensive hyperparameter searches and then fixed throughout training.
This work investigates whether online, adaptive architecture optimization can
escape this constraint and outperform static designs. We introduce NAS-DQN, an
agent that integrates a learned neural architecture search controller directly
into the DRL training loop, enabling dynamic network reconfiguration based on
cumulative performance feedback. We evaluate NAS-DQN against three
fixed-architecture baselines and a random search control on a continuous
control task, conducting experiments over multiple random seeds. Our results
demonstrate that NAS-DQN achieves superior final performance, sample
efficiency, and policy stability while incurring negligible computational
overhead. Critically, the learned search strategy substantially outperforms
both undirected random architecture exploration and poorly-chosen fixed
designs, indicating that intelligent, performance-guided search is the key
mechanism driving success. These findings establish that architecture
adaptation is not merely beneficial but necessary for optimal sample efficiency
in online deep reinforcement learning, and suggest that the design of RL agents
need not be a static offline choice but can instead be seamlessly integrated as
a dynamic component of the learning process itself.

TL;DR: ReGraphT是一个无需训练的检索增强生成框架，通过构建CUDA优化轨迹的推理图，将大语言模型的推理能力转移到小模型上，使小模型在CUDA代码生成任务中接近大模型性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前使用大语言模型生成优化CUDA代码面临代码泄露风险和计算成本高的问题，而小模型虽然轻量且隐私友好，但在复杂CUDA生成任务中推理能力有限导致性能不佳。

Method: 提出ReGraphT框架：将CUDA优化轨迹组织成结构化推理图，将组合优化建模为状态转换，利用蒙特卡洛图搜索进行高效探索。

Result: 实验显示ReGraphT在CUDAEval和ParEval基准上平均实现2.33倍加速，优于HPC专用微调模型和其他检索增强方法，使小模型接近大模型性能。

Conclusion: ReGraphT成功将大语言模型级推理能力转移到小模型，解决了隐私风险和计算开销问题，为高效CUDA代码生成提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Despite significant evolution of CUDA programming and domain-specific
libraries, effectively utilizing GPUs with massively parallel engines remains
difficult. Large language models (LLMs) show strong potential in generating
optimized CUDA code from sequential code. However, using LLMs in practice faces
two major challenges: cloud-based APIs pose risks of code leakage, and local
deployment is often computationally expensive and inefficient. These drawbacks
have spurred interest in small language models (SLMs), which are more
lightweight and privacy-friendly. Encouragingly, recent studies show that SLMs
can achieve performance comparable to LLMs on specific tasks. While SLMs can
match LLMs on domain-specific tasks, their limited reasoning abilities lead to
suboptimal performance in complex CUDA generation according to our experiments.
To bridge this gap, we propose ReGraphT, a training-free, retrieval-augmented
generation framework that transfers LLM-level reasoning to smaller models.
ReGraphT organizes CUDA optimization trajectories into a structured reasoning
graph, modeling the combined CUDA optimizations as state transitions, and
leverages Monte Carlo Graph Search (MCGS) for efficient exploration. We also
present a CUDA-specific benchmark with difficulty tiers defined by reasoning
complexity to evaluate models more comprehensively. Experiments show that
ReGraphT outperforms HPC-specific fine-tuned models and other
retrieval-augmented approaches, achieving an average 2.33X speedup on CUDAEval
and ParEval. When paired with DeepSeek-Coder-V2-Lite-Instruct and
Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct, ReGraphT enables SLMs to approach LLM-level
performance without the associated privacy risks or excessive computing
overhead.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出基于Transformer架构的深度学习模型，直接预测均衡路径流量，大幅降低计算时间，适应需求变化和网络结构调整。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于均衡原理的交通分配方法在大规模网络中计算复杂度非线性增长，计算成本过高。

Method: 使用深度神经网络，特别是Transformer架构，直接预测均衡路径流量，捕捉OD对间的复杂相关性。

Result: 在多个网络上测试，比传统优化方法快几个数量级，降低计算成本并提高预测精度，能灵活适应需求变化。

Conclusion: 该模型为交通管理提供快速"what-if"分析支持，增强交通规划和政策制定能力。

Abstract: The traffic assignment problem is essential for traffic flow analysis,
traditionally solved using mathematical programs under the Equilibrium
principle. These methods become computationally prohibitive for large-scale
networks due to non-linear growth in complexity with the number of OD pairs.
This study introduces a novel data-driven approach using deep neural networks,
specifically leveraging the Transformer architecture, to predict equilibrium
path flows directly. By focusing on path-level traffic distribution, the
proposed model captures intricate correlations between OD pairs, offering a
more detailed and flexible analysis compared to traditional link-level
approaches. The Transformer-based model drastically reduces computation time,
while adapting to changes in demand and network structure without the need for
recalculation. Numerical experiments are conducted on the Manhattan-like
synthetic network, the Sioux Falls network, and the Eastern-Massachusetts
network. The results demonstrate that the proposed model is orders of magnitude
faster than conventional optimization. It efficiently estimates path-level
traffic flows in multi-class networks, reducing computational costs and
improving prediction accuracy by capturing detailed trip and flow information.
The model also adapts flexibly to varying demand and network conditions,
supporting traffic management and enabling rapid `what-if' analyses for
enhanced transportation planning and policy-making.

TL;DR: 提出FairGRPO方法解决医疗AI系统中的群体公平性问题，通过分层强化学习和自适应重要性加权来减少不同人口群体的性能差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗AI系统在不同人口群体间存在显著的性能差异，对少数群体造成实际伤害。现有的多模态推理模型通过强化学习训练时会继承并放大训练数据中的偏见。

Method: FairGRPO是一种分层强化学习方法，采用基于表征、任务难度和数据来源的自适应重要性加权。当缺乏人口统计标签时，使用无监督聚类自动发现潜在的人口群体。

Result: 在7个临床诊断数据集上的实验表明，FairGRPO将预测公平性提高了27.2%，同时F1分数提升了12.49%。训练动态分析显示该方法在优化过程中持续改善公平性。

Conclusion: FairGRPO有效解决了医疗AI的公平性问题，基于该方法发布的FairMedGemma-4B模型在保持最先进性能的同时显著减少了群体间差异。

Abstract: Medical artificial intelligence systems have achieved remarkable diagnostic
capabilities, yet they consistently exhibit performance disparities across
demographic groups, causing real-world harm to underrepresented populations.
While recent multimodal reasoning foundation models have advanced clinical
diagnosis through integrated analysis of diverse medical data, reasoning
trainings via reinforcement learning inherit and often amplify biases present
in training datasets dominated by majority populations. We introduce
Fairness-aware Group Relative Policy Optimization (FairGRPO), a hierarchical
reinforcement learning approach that promotes equitable learning across
heterogeneous clinical populations. FairGRPO employs adaptive importance
weighting of advantages based on representation, task difficulty, and data
source. To address the common issue of missing demographic labels in the
clinical domain, we further employ unsupervised clustering, which automatically
discovers latent demographic groups when labels are unavailable. Through
comprehensive experiments across 7 clinical diagnostic datasets spanning 5
clinical modalities across X-ray, CT scan, dermoscropy, mammography and
ultrasound, we demonstrate that FairGRPO reduces predictive parity by 27.2%
against all vanilla and bias mitigated RL baselines, while improving F1 score
by 12.49%. Furthermore, training dynamics analysis reveals that FairGRPO
progressively improves fairness throughout optimization, while baseline RL
methods exhibit deteriorating fairness as training progresses. Based on
FairGRPO, we release FairMedGemma-4B, a fairness-aware clinical VLLM that
achieves state-of-the-art performance while demonstrating significantly reduced
disparities across demographic groups.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该研究系统比较了代码生成任务中不同检索配置的性能，发现：PL-PL任务中BM25+词级分割效果最佳；NL-PL任务中专用密集编码器表现更好但延迟高；最佳块大小随上下文窗口变化；基于行的分块与语法感知分割效果相当；不同配置间延迟差异可达200倍。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究在真实计算预算下代码导向生成任务的检索设计，为构建有效的代码导向RAG系统提供基于证据的建议。

Method: 使用Long Code Arena中的代码补全和错误定位任务，系统比较不同上下文窗口大小下的检索配置，包括分块策略、相似性评分和分割粒度三个维度。

Result: PL-PL任务中稀疏BM25+词级分割最有效且实用，显著优于密集替代方案且快一个数量级；NL-PL任务中专有密集编码器表现更好但延迟高100倍；最佳块大小随可用上下文缩放；基于行的分块与语法感知分割效果相当；检索延迟在不同配置间差异达200倍。

Conclusion: 为基于任务需求、模型约束和计算效率实现有效的代码导向RAG系统提供了基于证据的推荐配置。

Abstract: We study retrieval design for code-focused generation tasks under realistic
compute budgets. Using two complementary tasks from Long Code Arena -- code
completion and bug localization -- we systematically compare retrieval
configurations across various context window sizes along three axes: (i)
chunking strategy, (ii) similarity scoring, and (iii) splitting granularity.
(1) For PL-PL, sparse BM25 with word-level splitting is the most effective and
practical, significantly outperforming dense alternatives while being an order
of magnitude faster. (2) For NL-PL, proprietary dense encoders (Voyager-3
family) consistently beat sparse retrievers, however requiring 100x larger
latency. (3) Optimal chunk size scales with available context: 32-64 line
chunks work best at small budgets, and whole-file retrieval becomes competitive
at 16000 tokens. (4) Simple line-based chunking matches syntax-aware splitting
across budgets. (5) Retrieval latency varies by up to 200x across
configurations; BPE-based splitting is needlessly slow, and BM25 + word
splitting offers the best quality-latency trade-off. Thus, we provide
evidence-based recommendations for implementing effective code-oriented RAG
systems based on task requirements, model constraints, and computational
efficiency.

Motivation: 开发更透明、可靠和高效的临床决策支持系统，优化泌尿系统疾病的筛查和早期诊断，特别是膀胱癌。

Method: 采用XGBoost、LightGBM和CatBoost算法，使用Optuna进行超参数优化，SMOTE技术进行类别平衡，并通过SHAP进行特征选择。

Result: 基于SHAP的特征选择方法在保持或改善平衡准确率、精确度和特异性等性能指标方面表现有效。

Conclusion: 使用可解释性技术（SHAP）进行特征选择被证明是一种有效方法，有助于开发更透明的临床决策支持系统。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose an approach to support the diagnosis of urinary
tract diseases, with a focus on bladder cancer, using SHAP (SHapley Additive
exPlanations)-based feature selection to enhance the transparency and
effectiveness of predictive models. Six binary classification scenarios were
developed to distinguish bladder cancer from other urological and oncological
conditions. The algorithms XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost were employed, with
hyperparameter optimization performed using Optuna and class balancing with the
SMOTE technique. The selection of predictive variables was guided by importance
values through SHAP-based feature selection while maintaining or even improving
performance metrics such as balanced accuracy, precision, and specificity. The
use of explainability techniques (SHAP) for feature selection proved to be an
effective approach. The proposed methodology may contribute to the development
of more transparent, reliable, and efficient clinical decision support systems,
optimizing screening and early diagnosis of urinary tract diseases.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文首次分析了Muon优化器中非精确正交化更新的理论性能，揭示了近似精度与最优步长和动量参数之间的耦合关系。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Muon优化器在实践中依赖快速近似正交化，但现有理论分析都基于计算不可行的精确SVD更新，存在理论与实践的脱节。

Method: 在线性最小化预言机(LMO)优化框架下，引入加性误差模型来捕捉实际近似方案的非精确性，分析非精确正交化更新的性能边界。

Result: 分析表明性能下降与LMO非精确度成函数关系，揭示了非精确度与最优步长和动量参数的基本耦合：较低的神谕精度需要更小的步长但更大的动量参数。

Conclusion: 近似过程（如Newton-Schulz步数）从实现细节提升为必须与学习调度共同调优的关键参数，NanoGPT实验证实了预测的耦合关系。

Abstract: The Muon optimizer has rapidly emerged as a powerful, geometry-aware
alternative to AdamW, demonstrating strong performance in large-scale training
of neural networks. However, a critical theory-practice disconnect exists:
Muon's efficiency relies on fast, approximate orthogonalization, yet all prior
theoretical work analyzes an idealized, computationally intractable version
assuming exact SVD-based updates. This work moves beyond the ideal by providing
the first analysis of the inexact orthogonalized update at Muon's core. We
develop our analysis within the general framework of Linear Minimization Oracle
(LMO)-based optimization, introducing a realistic additive error model to
capture the inexactness of practical approximation schemes. Our analysis yields
explicit bounds that quantify performance degradation as a function of the LMO
inexactness/error. We reveal a fundamental coupling between this inexactness
and the optimal step size and momentum: lower oracle precision requires a
smaller step size but larger momentum parameter. These findings elevate the
approximation procedure (e.g., the number of Newton-Schulz steps) from an
implementation detail to a critical parameter that must be co-tuned with the
learning schedule. NanoGPT experiments directly confirm the predicted coupling,
with optimal learning rates clearly shifting as approximation precision
changes.

TL;DR: 提出基于MentalRoBERTa的分层双头神经网络，用于社交媒体自杀风险四等级分类，结合CORAL头保持序数关系和分类头实现灵活分类，通过多损失函数解决类别不平衡和过拟合问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体成为识别自杀风险的重要来源，但自动检测系统面临类别严重不平衡、发帖模式的时间复杂性以及风险级别既有序数性又有分类性的双重挑战。

Method: 使用MentalRoBERTa为基础，构建分层双头网络：CORAL头保持风险等级序数关系，标准分类头实现灵活分类；3层Transformer编码器建模时间依赖，显式时间间隔嵌入捕捉发帖动态；组合损失函数(0.5 CORAL + 0.3 交叉熵 + 0.2 Focal Loss)；冻结前6层MentalRoBERTa并使用混合精度训练。

Result: 使用5折分层交叉验证，以宏F1分数为主要评估指标进行模型评估。

Conclusion: 该模型通过双头架构和组合损失函数，有效解决了自杀风险分类中的序数关系保持、类别不平衡和过拟合问题，为社交媒体自杀风险检测提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Social media platforms have become important sources for identifying suicide
risk, but automated detection systems face multiple challenges including severe
class imbalance, temporal complexity in posting patterns, and the dual nature
of risk levels as both ordinal and categorical. This paper proposes a
hierarchical dual-head neural network based on MentalRoBERTa for suicide risk
classification into four levels: indicator, ideation, behavior, and attempt.
The model employs two complementary prediction heads operating on a shared
sequence representation: a CORAL (Consistent Rank Logits) head that preserves
ordinal relationships between risk levels, and a standard classification head
that enables flexible categorical distinctions. A 3-layer Transformer encoder
with 8-head multi-head attention models temporal dependencies across post
sequences, while explicit time interval embeddings capture posting behavior
dynamics. The model is trained with a combined loss function (0.5 CORAL + 0.3
Cross-Entropy + 0.2 Focal Loss) that simultaneously addresses ordinal structure
preservation, overconfidence reduction, and class imbalance. To improve
computational efficiency, we freeze the first 6 layers (50%) of MentalRoBERTa
and employ mixed-precision training. The model is evaluated using 5-fold
stratified cross-validation with macro F1 score as the primary metric.

Motivation: 去中心化联邦学习中的隐私预算量化具有挑战性，因为存在复杂的算法组件如去中心化通信和本地更新，现有方法难以准确评估隐私泄露。

Method: 开发了两种f-DP核算方法：PN-f-DP量化随机游走通信下用户对间的隐私泄露，Sec-f-LDP通过共享秘密支持结构化噪声注入，结合f-DP理论和马尔可夫链集中性工具。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的实验表明，相比Rényi DP方法，本文方法能产生更紧致的(ε,δ)边界和更好的模型效用。

Conclusion: f-DP在去中心化隐私核算中具有优势，能够捕捉稀疏通信、本地迭代和相关噪声带来的隐私放大效应。

Abstract: Differentially private (DP) decentralized Federated Learning (FL) allows
local users to collaborate without sharing their data with a central server.
However, accurately quantifying the privacy budget of private FL algorithms is
challenging due to the co-existence of complex algorithmic components such as
decentralized communication and local updates. This paper addresses privacy
accounting for two decentralized FL algorithms within the $f$-differential
privacy ($f$-DP) framework. We develop two new $f$-DP-based accounting methods
tailored to decentralized settings: Pairwise Network $f$-DP (PN-$f$-DP), which
quantifies privacy leakage between user pairs under random-walk communication,
and Secret-based $f$-Local DP (Sec-$f$-LDP), which supports structured noise
injection via shared secrets. By combining tools from $f$-DP theory and Markov
chain concentration, our accounting framework captures privacy amplification
arising from sparse communication, local iterations, and correlated noise.
Experiments on synthetic and real datasets demonstrate that our methods yield
consistently tighter $(\epsilon,\delta)$ bounds and improved utility compared
to R\'enyi DP-based approaches, illustrating the benefits of $f$-DP in
decentralized privacy accounting.

TL;DR: 本文分析了持续学习中任务排序对线性回归性能的影响，特别关注贪心最大化任务间差异性的排序策略，并与随机排序进行比较。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究任务排序在持续学习中的重要性，特别是贪心排序策略的有效性，这在先前工作中虽有提及但仍存在许多未解问题。

Method: 使用Kaczmarz方法工具，形式化贪心排序策略，开发几何和代数直觉，并进行实证分析和理论证明。

Result: 实证显示贪心排序在平均损失收敛速度上优于随机排序；理论上证明在高秩回归设置下贪心排序与随机排序有类似损失界，但在一般秩设置下存在重复依赖的分离。

Conclusion: 揭示了贪心和随机排序策略之间的细微差别，贪心排序在允许重复时收敛速度为O(1/³√k)，而单次贪心排序可能失败，随机排序收敛速度为O(1/√k)。

Abstract: We analyze task orderings in continual learning for linear regression,
assuming joint realizability of training data. We focus on orderings that
greedily maximize dissimilarity between consecutive tasks, a concept briefly
explored in prior work but still surrounded by open questions. Using tools from
the Kaczmarz method literature, we formalize such orderings and develop
geometric and algebraic intuitions around them. Empirically, we demonstrate
that greedy orderings converge faster than random ones in terms of the average
loss across tasks, both for linear regression with random data and for linear
probing on CIFAR-100 classification tasks. Analytically, in a high-rank
regression setting, we prove a loss bound for greedy orderings analogous to
that of random ones. However, under general rank, we establish a
repetition-dependent separation. Specifically, while prior work showed that for
random orderings, with or without replacement, the average loss after $k$
iterations is bounded by $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{k})$, we prove that single-pass
greedy orderings may fail catastrophically, whereas those allowing repetition
converge at rate $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt[3]{k})$. Overall, we reveal nuances
within and between greedy and random orderings.

Result: 在单资产和多资产交易任务上的实验表明，该方法获得了更优的夏普比率，并在交易量增加时保持鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 该方法为金融市场中的RL提供了更忠实和可扩展的解决方案，能有效处理市场影响的定向特性。

Abstract: In financial applications, reinforcement learning (RL) agents are commonly
trained on historical data, where their actions do not influence prices.
However, during deployment, these agents trade in live markets where their own
transactions can shift asset prices, a phenomenon known as market impact. This
mismatch between training and deployment environments can significantly degrade
performance. Traditional robust RL approaches address this model
misspecification by optimizing the worst-case performance over a set of
uncertainties, but typically rely on symmetric structures that fail to capture
the directional nature of market impact. To address this issue, we develop a
novel class of elliptic uncertainty sets. We establish both implicit and
explicit closed-form solutions for the worst-case uncertainty under these sets,
enabling efficient and tractable robust policy evaluation. Experiments on
single-asset and multi-asset trading tasks demonstrate that our method achieves
superior Sharpe ratio and remains robust under increasing trade volumes,
offering a more faithful and scalable approach to RL in financial markets.

*Shaocong Ma,Heng Huang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种新的无偏零阶梯度估计器家族，通过重新构建方向导数为伸缩级数并使用精心设计的分布采样，解决了现有零阶优化方法中梯度估计器的偏差问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有零阶优化方法中的梯度估计器存在固有偏差，除非扰动步长趋近于零，这限制了优化性能。需要开发无偏的梯度估计器来克服这一限制。

Result: 理论分析证明使用所提估计器的SGD在光滑非凸目标上达到最优复杂度。在合成任务和语言模型微调实验中的表现优于标准方法，具有更高的精度和收敛性。

Conclusion: 提出的无偏梯度估计器家族有效解决了零阶优化中的偏差问题，在理论和实验上都表现出优越性能，为梯度不可用或计算昂贵场景提供了更好的优化方案。

Abstract: Zeroth-order optimization (ZOO) is an important framework for stochastic
optimization when gradients are unavailable or expensive to compute. A
potential limitation of existing ZOO methods is the bias inherent in most
gradient estimators unless the perturbation stepsize vanishes. In this paper,
we overcome this biasedness issue by proposing a novel family of unbiased
gradient estimators based solely on function evaluations. By reformulating
directional derivatives as a telescoping series and sampling from carefully
designed distributions, we construct estimators that eliminate bias while
maintaining favorable variance. We analyze their theoretical properties, derive
optimal scaling distributions and perturbation stepsizes of four specific
constructions, and prove that SGD using the proposed estimators achieves
optimal complexity for smooth non-convex objectives. Experiments on synthetic
tasks and language model fine-tuning confirm the superior accuracy and
convergence of our approach compared to standard methods.

*Shaocong Ma,Heng Huang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文研究两点零阶梯度估计器，发现当扰动步长趋近于零时，最小化估计器渐近方差的扰动分布可以与真实梯度方向对齐，而非固定长度。提出了方向对齐扰动(DAP)方案，理论和实证表明其在特定条件下优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有研究主要关注固定长度扰动，而忽略了扰动方向与梯度对齐的潜在优势。本文旨在探索这种方向对齐扰动对梯度估计器性能的提升。

Method: 将问题表述为扰动分布空间上的约束函数优化问题，提出方向对齐扰动(DAP)方案，该方案自适应地在关键方向上提供更高精度，并对使用δ-无偏随机扰动的随机梯度下降进行收敛分析。

Result: 理论和实证评估表明，方向对齐扰动(DAP)在特定条件下优于传统方法，在合成问题和实际任务中都表现出更好的性能。

Conclusion: 方向对齐的扰动方案能够有效提升梯度估计器的性能，扩展了现有复杂度界限到更广泛的扰动类型，为优化算法设计提供了新的思路。

Abstract: In this paper, we explore the two-point zeroth-order gradient estimator and
identify the distribution of random perturbations that minimizes the
estimator's asymptotic variance as the perturbation stepsize tends to zero. We
formulate it as a constrained functional optimization problem over the space of
perturbation distributions. Our findings reveal that such desired perturbations
can align directionally with the true gradient, instead of maintaining a fixed
length. While existing research has largely focused on fixed-length
perturbations, the potential advantages of directional alignment have been
overlooked. To address this gap, we delve into the theoretical and empirical
properties of the directionally aligned perturbation (DAP) scheme, which
adaptively offers higher accuracy along critical directions. Additionally, we
provide a convergence analysis for stochastic gradient descent using
$\delta$-unbiased random perturbations, extending existing complexity bounds to
a wider range of perturbations. Through empirical evaluations on both synthetic
problems and practical tasks, we demonstrate that DAPs outperform traditional
methods under specific conditions.

*Hanbin Hong,Ashish Kundu,Ali Payani,Binghui Wang,Yuan Hong*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: UCAN提出了一种使用各向异性噪声的通用对抗鲁棒性认证方法，能够将现有的随机平滑方法从对称噪声扩展到非对称噪声分布，显著提升认证精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的随机平滑方法主要使用各向同性噪声分布，忽略了输入和数据维度的异质性，限制了鲁棒性认证的效果。

Method: 开发了UCAN框架，通过各向异性噪声注入来保证分类器在扰动输入上的预测，并设计了三种噪声参数生成器来优化不同数据维度的噪声参数。

Result: 在MNIST、CIFAR10和ImageNet数据集上，UCAN在大认证半径下的认证精度相比现有方法提升了182.6%。

Conclusion: UCAN通过各向异性噪声显著提升了对抗鲁棒性认证的效果，为随机平滑方法提供了更有效的防御策略。

Abstract: Randomized smoothing has become essential for achieving certified adversarial
robustness in machine learning models. However, current methods primarily use
isotropic noise distributions that are uniform across all data dimensions, such
as image pixels, limiting the effectiveness of robustness certification by
ignoring the heterogeneity of inputs and data dimensions. To address this
limitation, we propose UCAN: a novel technique that \underline{U}niversally
\underline{C}ertifies adversarial robustness with \underline{A}nisotropic
\underline{N}oise. UCAN is designed to enhance any existing randomized
smoothing method, transforming it from symmetric (isotropic) to asymmetric
(anisotropic) noise distributions, thereby offering a more tailored defense
against adversarial attacks. Our theoretical framework is versatile, supporting
a wide array of noise distributions for certified robustness in different
$\ell_p$-norms and applicable to any arbitrary classifier by guaranteeing the
classifier's prediction over perturbed inputs with provable robustness bounds
through tailored noise injection. Additionally, we develop a novel framework
equipped with three exemplary noise parameter generators (NPGs) to optimally
fine-tune the anisotropic noise parameters for different data dimensions,
allowing for pursuing different levels of robustness enhancements in
practice.Empirical evaluations underscore the significant leap in UCAN's
performance over existing state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating up to
$182.6\%$ improvement in certified accuracy at large certified radii on MNIST,
CIFAR10, and ImageNet datasets.\footnote{Code is anonymously available at

*Renzhao Liang,Sizhe Xu,Chenggang Xie,Jingru Chen,Feiyang Ren,Shu Yang,Takahiro Yabe*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该研究挑战了时序预测中"长序列信息增益假说"，发现适当截断历史数据反而能提高预测精度，提出AMRC方法通过动态掩码损失和表示一致性约束来抑制冗余特征学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度学习时序预测模型基于"长序列信息增益假说"，但该研究通过系统实验发现该假设存在固有局限性，模型在学习过程中会吸收大量冗余特征（如噪声或不相关波动），从而影响有效信号提取。

Method: 提出AMRC方法，包含两个核心组件：1）动态掩码损失，自适应识别高区分度时间片段来指导模型训练中的梯度下降；2）表示一致性约束，稳定输入、标签和预测之间的映射关系。

Result: 实验结果表明AMRC能有效抑制冗余特征学习，同时显著提升模型性能。

Conclusion: 这项工作不仅挑战了时序建模中的传统假设，还为开发高效鲁棒的预测模型提供了新的理论见解和方法突破。

Abstract: Time series forecasting plays a pivotal role in critical domains such as
energy management and financial markets. Although deep learning-based
approaches (e.g., MLP, RNN, Transformer) have achieved remarkable progress, the
prevailing "long-sequence information gain hypothesis" exhibits inherent
limitations. Through systematic experimentation, this study reveals a
counterintuitive phenomenon: appropriately truncating historical data can
paradoxically enhance prediction accuracy, indicating that existing models
learn substantial redundant features (e.g., noise or irrelevant fluctuations)
during training, thereby compromising effective signal extraction. Building
upon information bottleneck theory, we propose an innovative solution termed
Adaptive Masking Loss with Representation Consistency (AMRC), which features
two core components: 1) Dynamic masking loss, which adaptively identified
highly discriminative temporal segments to guide gradient descent during model
training; 2) Representation consistency constraint, which stabilized the
mapping relationships among inputs, labels, and predictions. Experimental
results demonstrate that AMRC effectively suppresses redundant feature learning
while significantly improving model performance. This work not only challenges
conventional assumptions in temporal modeling but also provides novel
theoretical insights and methodological breakthroughs for developing efficient
and robust forecasting models.

*Zachary Horvitz,Raghav Singhal,Hao Zou,Carles Domingo-Enrich,Zhou Yu,Rajesh Ranganath,Kathleen McKeown*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出推理即填充和多重令牌熵解码方法，利用掩码扩散语言模型的特性改进推理过程和后训练数据生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 掩码扩散语言模型在数学和编程任务中，任意顺序解码往往表现不佳或与从左到右采样相似，标准多重令牌解码会显著降低性能。需要证明这种额外计算的价值。

Method: 1. 推理即填充：使用MDLM填充推理模板，区分推理和答案令牌，测量答案不确定性并提前退出；2. 多重令牌熵解码：基于条件熵的自适应采样器，减少并行解码位置时的错误。

Result: 在GSM8k上，基于后验推理轨迹微调LLaDA-8B Base的性能提升与使用人工编写推理轨迹相当；MED在保持性能的同时减少2.7倍步骤。

Conclusion: MDLM的训练和计算解锁了许多新的推理和后训练方法，证明了其计算投入的价值。

Abstract: Masked diffusion language models (MDLMs) are trained to in-fill positions in
randomly masked sequences, in contrast to next-token prediction models.
Discussions around MDLMs focus on two benefits: (1) any-order decoding and 2)
multi-token decoding. However, we observe that for math and coding tasks,
any-order algorithms often underperform or behave similarly to left-to-right
sampling, and standard multi-token decoding significantly degrades performance.
At inference time, MDLMs compute the conditional distribution of all masked
positions. A natural question is: How can we justify this additional compute
when left-to-right one-token-at-a-time decoding is on par with any-order
decoding algorithms? First, we propose reasoning-as-infilling. By using MDLMs
to infill a reasoning template, we can structure outputs and distinguish
between reasoning and answer tokens. In turn, this enables measuring answer
uncertainty during reasoning, and early exits when the model converges on an
answer. Next, given an answer, reasoning-as-infilling enables sampling from the
MDLM posterior over reasoning traces conditioned on the answer, providing a new
source of high-quality data for post-training. On GSM8k, we observe that
fine-tuning LLaDA-8B Base on its posterior reasoning traces provides a
performance boost on par with fine-tuning on human-written reasoning traces.
Additionally, given an answer, reasoning-as-infilling provides a method for
scoring the correctness of the reasoning process at intermediate steps. Second,
we propose multi-token entropy decoding (MED), a simple adaptive sampler that
minimizes the error incurred by decoding positions in parallel based on the
conditional entropies of those positions. MED preserves performance across
benchmarks and leads to 2.7x fewer steps. Our work demonstrates that the
training and compute used by MDLMs unlock many new inference and post-training
methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 使用监督学习和决策树分类器，在CAD建模的平面图中基于RFID的RSSI数据进行12个实验室区域的定位推断，总体准确率为34.2%，部分区域F1分数超过0.40，但稀有类别分类效果较差。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: RFID跟踪在国防资产存储中具有应用潜力，但传感器特异性差（包括远程检测、欺骗和伪造等漏洞）可能导致错误检测和操作安全事件，需要改进定位性能。

Method: 采用监督学习模拟，使用真实的RSSI数据和决策树分类，在CAD建模的平面图中进行多类分类，处理类别不平衡问题，计算类别权重，并使用分层子样本训练模型。

Result: 模型在5000个平衡观测值上训练，总体准确率为34.2%，多个区域（F、G、H等）的F1分数超过0.40，但稀有类别（特别是LabZoneC）经常被错误分类。

Conclusion: 基于RSSI的决策树可在实际模拟中应用于区域级异常检测或误放监控，通过改进天线布局、增加传感器或与其他模态的传感器融合可提高低覆盖和低信号区域的分类性能。

Abstract: Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) tracking may be a viable solution for
defense assets that must be stored in accordance with security guidelines.
However, poor sensor specificity (vulnerabilities include long range detection,
spoofing, and counterfeiting) can lead to erroneous detection and operational
security events. We present a supervised learning simulation with realistic
Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) data and Decision Tree classification
in a Computer Assisted Design (CAD)-modeled floor plan that encapsulates some
of the challenges encountered in defense storage. In this work, we focused on
classifying 12 lab zones (LabZoneA-L) to perform location inference. The raw
dataset had approximately 980,000 reads. Class frequencies were imbalanced, and
class weights were calculated to account for class imbalance in this
multi-class setting. The model, trained on stratified subsamples to 5,000
balanced observations, yielded an overall accuracy of 34.2% and F1-scores
greater than 0.40 for multiple zones (Zones F, G, H, etc.). However, rare
classes (most notably LabZoneC) were often misclassified, even with the use of
class weights. An adjacency-aware confusion matrix was calculated to allow
better interpretation of physically adjacent zones. These results suggest that
RSSI-based decision trees can be applied in realistic simulations to enable
zone-level anomaly detection or misplacement monitoring for defense supply
logistics. Reliable classification performance in low-coverage and low-signal
zones could be improved with better antenna placement or additional sensors and
sensor fusion with other modalities.

TL;DR: SALT是一个轻量级框架，通过构建轨迹图来提供更细粒度的优势分配，解决基于群体的强化学习算法中稀疏奖励导致的训练不稳定问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型在单轮任务中表现出色，但在复杂多步任务中面临挑战。基于群体的强化学习算法（如GRPO）仅依赖稀疏结果奖励，导致训练不稳定和次优策略。

Method: 提出SALT框架，从相同提示的轨迹构建图，量化每个步骤的质量并相应分配优势值。该框架作为即插即用模块与现有群体RL算法集成，无需修改rollout过程且计算开销极小。

Result: 在WebShop、ALFWorld和AppWorld基准测试中，SALT在不同模型规模下均能持续提升性能。

Conclusion: SALT通过细粒度优势分配有效解决了群体RL算法中的奖励稀疏问题，提高了训练稳定性和策略质量。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities,
enabling language agents to excel at single-turn tasks. However, their
application to complex, multi-step, and long-horizon tasks remains challenging.
While reinforcement learning (RL) offers a promising avenue for addressing
these challenges, mainstream approaches typically rely solely on sparse,
outcome-based rewards, a limitation that becomes especially problematic for
group-based RL algorithms lacking critic models, such as Group Relative Policy
Optimization (GRPO). In such methods, uniformly rewarding or penalizing all
actions within a trajectory can lead to training instability and suboptimal
policies, because beneficial and detrimental actions are often entangled across
multi-step interactions. To address this challenge, we propose SALT, a novel
and lightweight framework that provides a finer-grained advantage assignment,
derived solely from outcome rewards. We achieve this by constructing a graph
from trajectories of the same prompt, which allows us to quantify the quality
of each step and assign advantages accordingly. Crucially, SALT is designed as
a plug-and-play module that seamlessly integrates with existing group-based RL
algorithms, requiring no modifications to the rollout procedure and introducing
negligible computational overhead. Extensive experiments on the WebShop,
ALFWorld, and AppWorld benchmarks with various model sizes demonstrate that
SALT consistently improves performance. We also conduct a thorough analysis to
validate the design choices behind SALT and offer actionable insights.

Abstract: Since its 2009 genesis block, the Bitcoin network has processed \num{>1.08}
billion (B) transactions representing \num{>8.72}B BTC, offering rich potential
for machine learning (ML); yet, its pseudonymity and obscured flow of funds
inherent in its \utxo-based design, have rendered this data largely

funds. This temporal, heterogeneous graph encompasses complete transaction
history up to block \cutoffHeight, consisting of \num{>2.4}B nodes and
\num{>39.72}B edges. Additionally, we provide custom sampling methods yielding
node and edge feature vectors of sampled communities, tools to load and analyze
the Bitcoin graph data within specialized graph databases, and ready-to-use
database snapshots. This comprehensive dataset and toolkit empower the ML
community to tackle Bitcoin's intricate ecosystem at scale, driving progress in

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统时序点过程模型采用自回归方式，采样过程必须顺序执行，效率受限。需要解决表达性建模与高效并行生成之间的矛盾。

Result: 在真实世界数据集上实现了经验性的加速效果，为大规模TPP应用提供了高效并行生成能力。

Conclusion: 该方法成功弥合了表达性建模与高效并行生成之间的差距，为时序点过程的大规模应用提供了新的可能性。

Abstract: Temporal point processes are powerful generative models for event sequences
that capture complex dependencies in time-series data. They are commonly
specified using autoregressive models that learn the distribution of the next
event from the previous events. This makes sampling inherently sequential,
limiting efficiency. In this paper, we propose a novel algorithm based on
rejection sampling that enables exact sampling of multiple future values from
existing TPP models, in parallel, and without requiring any architectural
changes or retraining. Besides theoretical guarantees, our method demonstrates
empirical speedups on real-world datasets, bridging the gap between expressive
modeling and efficient parallel generation for large-scale TPP applications.

TL;DR: 提出了一种考虑广告延迟效应、累积影响和用户异质性的个性化竞价策略，使用上下文马尔可夫决策过程建模，结合两阶段最大似然估计和强化学习算法，实现了接近最优的后悔界。


<details>

Motivation: 在线广告平台需要有效的竞价策略来最大化利润，但现有研究往往未能同时考虑广告的延迟和长期效应、累积影响（如强化或疲劳效应）以及用户异质性这三个关键因素。

Method: 将广告竞价建模为具有延迟泊松奖励的上下文马尔可夫决策过程，提出两阶段最大似然估计器结合数据分割策略，并在此基础上设计强化学习算法来推导个性化竞价策略。

Result: 该方法实现了$\tilde{O}{(dH^2\sqrt{T})}$的接近最优后悔界，其中$d$是上下文维度，$H$是轮数，$T$是客户数量。理论结果通过仿真实验得到验证。

Conclusion: 所提出的方法能够有效处理广告竞价中的延迟效应、累积影响和用户异质性，为在线广告平台提供了理论保证的个性化竞价策略。

Abstract: Online advertising platforms use automated auctions to connect advertisers
with potential customers, requiring effective bidding strategies to maximize
profits. Accurate ad impact estimation requires considering three key factors:
delayed and long-term effects, cumulative ad impacts such as reinforcement or
fatigue, and customer heterogeneity. However, these effects are often not
jointly addressed in previous studies. To capture these factors, we model ad
bidding as a Contextual Markov Decision Process (CMDP) with delayed Poisson
rewards. For efficient estimation, we propose a two-stage maximum likelihood
estimator combined with data-splitting strategies, ensuring controlled
estimation error based on the first-stage estimator's (in)accuracy. Building on
this, we design a reinforcement learning algorithm to derive efficient
personalized bidding strategies. This approach achieves a near-optimal regret
bound of $\tilde{O}{(dH^2\sqrt{T})}$, where $d$ is the contextual dimension,
$H$ is the number of rounds, and $T$ is the number of customers. Our
theoretical findings are validated by simulation experiments.

Conclusion: 提出的在线草稿模型选择方法能够有效加速LLM推理，在多种推测解码场景下都表现出优越性能

Abstract: Speculative decoding is widely used in accelerating large language model
(LLM) inference. In this work, we focus on the online draft model selection
problem in speculative decoding. We design an algorithm that provably competes
with the best draft model in hindsight for each query in terms of either the
token acceptance probability or expected acceptance length. In particular, we
show that we can accurately evaluate all draft models, instead of only the
chosen model without incurring additional queries to the target model, which
allows us to improve exponentially over the existing bandit-based approach as
the number of draft models increases. Our approach is generically applicable
with any speculative decoding methods (single draft, multi-drafts and
draft-trees). Moreover, we design system-efficient versions of online learners
and demonstrate that the overhead in computation and latency can be
substantially reduced. We conduct extensive experiments on open-source LLMs and
diverse datasets, demonstrating that our methods substantially outperform the
state-of-the-art EAGLE3 and the BanditSpec baseline in a variety of domains
where specialized domain-expert drafters are available, especially when long
reasoning chains are required.

Conclusion: 核心加密资产的流动性和波动性指标对市场整体风险具有预测能力，为风险管理提供了实证依据。

Abstract: We study whether liquidity and volatility proxies of a core set of
cryptoassets generate spillovers that forecast market-wide risk. Our empirical
framework integrates three statistical layers: (A) interactions between core
liquidity and returns, (B) principal-component relations linking liquidity and
returns, and (C) volatility-factor projections that capture cross-sectional
volatility crowding. The analysis is complemented by vector autoregression
impulse responses and forecast error variance decompositions (see Granger 1969;
Sims 1980), heterogeneous autoregressive models with exogenous regressors
(HAR-X, Corsi 2009), and a leakage-safe machine learning protocol using
temporal splits, early stopping, validation-only thresholding, and SHAP-based
interpretation. Using daily data from 2021 to 2025 (1462 observations across 74
assets), we document statistically significant Granger-causal relationships
across layers and moderate out-of-sample predictive accuracy. We report the
most informative figures, including the pipeline overview, Layer A heatmap,
Layer C robustness analysis, vector autoregression variance decompositions, and
the test-set precision-recall curve. Full data and figure outputs are provided

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法要么忽略时间结构（如对齐或多视图方法），要么局限于单脑区、假设线性读取、或混淆共享与私有信号（如动态潜变量模型）。需要同时处理非平稳非线性动态以及分离共享与区域特异性结构的统一框架。

Conclusion: CTAE提供了一个统一框架，能有效处理多脑区神经记录中的复杂动态，并成功分离共享和区域特异性信号。

Abstract: Simultaneous recordings from thousands of neurons across multiple brain areas
reveal rich mixtures of activity that are shared between regions and dynamics
that are unique to each region. Existing alignment or multi-view methods
neglect temporal structure, whereas dynamical latent variable models capture
temporal dependencies but are usually restricted to a single area, assume
linear read-outs, or conflate shared and private signals. We introduce the
Coupled Transformer Autoencoder (CTAE) - a sequence model that addresses both
(i) non-stationary, non-linear dynamics and (ii) separation of shared versus
region-specific structure in a single framework. CTAE employs transformer

partitions each region's latent space into orthogonal shared and private
subspaces. We demonstrate the effectiveness of CTAE on two high-density
electrophysiology datasets with simultaneous recordings from multiple regions,
one from motor cortical areas and the other from sensory areas. CTAE extracts
meaningful representations that better decode behavioral variables compared to
existing approaches.

*Bosong Huang,Ming Jin,Yuxuan Liang,Johan Barthelemy,Debo Cheng,Qingsong Wen,Chenghao Liu,Shirui Pan*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ShapeX是一个创新的时间序列分类解释框架，通过识别关键shapelets（形状片段）并使用Shapley值评估其重要性，提供比现有方法更精确和因果保真的解释。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在医疗和金融等高风险应用中，时间序列分类模型的透明度至关重要。现有后验解释方法主要关注时间步级别的特征归因，忽视了分类结果主要由关键shapelets驱动的基本先验。

Method: ShapeX框架包含Shapelet描述与检测（SDD）框架，能够学习对分类至关重要的多样化shapelets，然后使用Shapley值评估这些shapelet驱动片段的重要性。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的实验表明，ShapeX在识别最相关子序列方面优于现有方法，提高了时间序列解释的精度和因果保真度。

Conclusion: ShapeX通过shapelet驱动的解释方法，能够揭示因果关系而不仅仅是相关性，为高风险应用中的时间序列分类提供了更可靠和透明的解释。

Abstract: Explaining time series classification models is crucial, particularly in
high-stakes applications such as healthcare and finance, where transparency and
trust play a critical role. Although numerous time series classification
methods have identified key subsequences, known as shapelets, as core features
for achieving state-of-the-art performance and validating their pivotal role in
classification outcomes, existing post-hoc time series explanation (PHTSE)
methods primarily focus on timestep-level feature attribution. These
explanation methods overlook the fundamental prior that classification outcomes
are predominantly driven by key shapelets. To bridge this gap, we present
ShapeX, an innovative framework that segments time series into meaningful
shapelet-driven segments and employs Shapley values to assess their saliency.
At the core of ShapeX lies the Shapelet Describe-and-Detect (SDD) framework,
which effectively learns a diverse set of shapelets essential for
classification. We further demonstrate that ShapeX produces explanations which
reveal causal relationships instead of just correlations, owing to the
atomicity properties of shapelets. Experimental results on both synthetic and
real-world datasets demonstrate that ShapeX outperforms existing methods in
identifying the most relevant subsequences, enhancing both the precision and
causal fidelity of time series explanations.

*Amartya Roy,Souvik Chakraborty*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于博弈论强化学习的因果发现框架，通过DDQN智能体与强基线算法竞争，实现了理论保证与实用性的统一


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决因果发现领域存在的核心矛盾：经验性能强的算法缺乏有限样本理论保证，而有理论保证的方法无法扩展到实际问题

Method: 使用DDQN强化学习智能体与GES或GraN-DAG等基线算法直接竞争，始终从对手的解决方案进行热启动

Result: 在合成SEM（30节点）上观察到的错误概率随样本量衰减，与理论紧密匹配；在真实世界基准测试中持续改进GES和GraN-DAG，同时保持理论安全性，可扩展到Hepar2（70节点）、Dream（100节点）和Andes（220节点）等大型图

Conclusion: 建立了一类新的基于强化学习的因果发现算法，同时具备可证明的一致性、样本效率和实际可扩展性，标志着将经验性能与严格有限样本理论统一的关键一步

Abstract: Causal discovery remains a central challenge in machine learning, yet
existing methods face a fundamental gap: algorithms like GES and GraN-DAG
achieve strong empirical performance but lack finite-sample guarantees, while
theoretically principled approaches fail to scale. We close this gap by
introducing a game-theoretic reinforcement learning framework for causal
discovery, where a DDQN agent directly competes against a strong baseline (GES
or GraN-DAG), always warm-starting from the opponent's solution. This design
yields three provable guarantees: the learned graph is never worse than the
opponent, warm-starting strictly accelerates convergence, and most importantly,
with high probability the algorithm selects the true best candidate graph. To
the best of our knowledge, our result makes a first-of-its-kind progress in
explaining such finite-sample guarantees in causal discovery: on synthetic SEMs
(30 nodes), the observed error probability decays with n, tightly matching
theory. On real-world benchmarks including Sachs, Asia, Alarm, Child, Hepar2,
Dream, and Andes, our method consistently improves upon GES and GraN-DAG while
remaining theoretically safe. Remarkably, it scales to large graphs such as
Hepar2 (70 nodes), Dream (100 nodes), and Andes (220 nodes). Together, these
results establish a new class of RL-based causal discovery algorithms that are
simultaneously provably consistent, sample-efficient, and practically scalable,
marking a decisive step toward unifying empirical performance with rigorous
finite-sample theory.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的维度加权方案，并将其整合到KNN分类器中，通过加权Minkowski距离来提高模式分类性能，特别是在高维基因表达数据集上取得了显著效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在多维样本的模式分类中，基于权重的维度距离度量对反映样本间相似度至关重要。虽然欧氏距离被广泛使用，但仍存在诸多问题，需要更有效的距离度量和维度加权方法。

Method: 提出了新的维度加权方案，将其整合到KNN分类器中，使用加权Minkowski距离来调节包含k个参考样本区域的大小和形状。

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上表现优于传统KNN，特别是在基因表达数据集上，分类准确率在所有交叉验证实验中均有显著提升（约10%）。

Conclusion: 该方法通过加权Minkowski距离和新的加权方案，为KNN分类器提供了重要的泛化能力，特别适用于样本少、维度高的数据集。

Abstract: Studies on various facets of pattern classification is often imperative while
working with multi-dimensional samples pertaining to diverse application
scenarios. In this notion, weighted dimension-based distance measure has been
one of the vital considerations in pattern analysis as it reflects the degree
of similarity between samples. Though it is often presumed to be settled with
the pervasive use of Euclidean distance, plethora of issues often surface. In
this paper, we present (a) a detail analysis on the impact of distance measure
norms and weights of dimensions along with visualization, (b) a novel weighting
scheme for each dimension, (c) incorporation of this dimensional weighting
schema into a KNN classifier, and (d) pattern classification on a variety of
synthetic as well as realistic datasets with the developed model. It has
performed well across diverse experiments in comparison to the traditional KNN
under the same experimental setups. Specifically, for gene expression datasets,
it yields significant and consistent gain in classification accuracy (around
10%) in all cross-validation experiments with different values of k. As such
datasets contain limited number of samples of high dimensions, meaningful
selection of nearest neighbours is desirable, and this requirement is
reasonably met by regulating the shape and size of the region enclosing the k
number of reference samples with the developed weighting schema and appropriate
norm. It, therefore, stands as an important generalization of KNN classifier
powered by weighted Minkowski distance with the present weighting schema.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种完全解耦的训练策略来解决原型自监督学习中的原型坍缩问题，通过分别优化原型和编码器来获得更多样化的原型表示和更好的下游性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 原型自监督学习方法普遍存在部分原型坍缩问题，即多个原型收敛到几乎相同的表示，这削弱了它们提供多样化目标来指导编码器学习丰富表示的核心目的。现有方法通常通过过度参数化原型集或添加临时正则化来缓解症状，而非解决根本原因。

Method: 引入完全解耦的训练策略，将原型和编码器在独立的目标下分别学习。具体来说，将原型建模为高斯混合模型，使用在线EM风格的过程进行更新，独立于编码器的损失函数。

Result: 这种简单而原则性的解耦方法无需显式正则化就能消除原型坍缩，产生持续多样化的原型和更强的下游性能。

Conclusion: 通过打破原型和编码器的联合优化，解决了原型自监督学习中的根本问题，提供了一种更有效的训练策略。

Abstract: Prototypical self-supervised learning methods consistently suffer from
partial prototype collapse, where multiple prototypes converge to nearly
identical representations. This undermines their central purpose -- providing
diverse and informative targets to guide encoders toward rich representations
-- and has led practitioners to over-parameterize prototype sets or add ad-hoc
regularizers, which mitigate symptoms rather than address the root cause. We
empirically trace the collapse to the joint optimization of encoders and
prototypes, which encourages a type of shortcut learning: early in training
prototypes drift toward redundant representations that minimize loss without
necessarily enhancing representation diversity. To break the joint
optimization, we introduce a fully decoupled training strategy that learns
prototypes and encoders under separate objectives. Concretely, we model
prototypes as a Gaussian mixture updated with an online EM-style procedure,
independent of the encoder's loss. This simple yet principled decoupling
eliminates prototype collapse without explicit regularization and yields
consistently diverse prototypes and stronger downstream performance.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 时间序列基础模型（TSFMs）表现不佳，因为盲目套用NLP或CV的范式不适用。时间序列数据缺乏像语言和视觉中那样的概念密度，需要基于不变性原则构建数据集来确保表示完整性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前时间序列基础模型表现不如轻量级监督基线和经典模型，原因是直接套用NLP或CV的数据收集范式不适用于时间序列数据的特点。

Method: 提出从机会性聚合转向原则性设计，基于时间序列不变性的本体论，构建能够系统覆盖时间语义不变性空间的数据集。

Result: 通过分析指出当前TSFMs的局限性，并提出新的发展方向。

Conclusion: 只有通过确保不变性覆盖来实现表示完整性，时间序列基础模型才能获得必要的对齐结构，实现泛化、推理和真正的新兴行为。

Abstract: Timeseries foundation models (TSFMs) have multiplied, yet lightweight
supervised baselines and even classical models often match them. We argue this
gap stems from the naive importation of NLP or CV pipelines. In language and
vision, large web-scale corpora densely capture human concepts i.e. there are
countless images and text of apples. In contrast, timeseries data is built to
complement the image and text modalities. There are no timeseries dataset that
contains the concept apple. As a result, the scrape-everything-online paradigm
fails for TS. We posit that progress demands a shift from opportunistic
aggregation to principled design: constructing datasets that systematically
span the space of invariance that preserve temporal semantics. To this end, we
suggest that the ontology of timeseries invariances should be built based on
first principles. Only by ensuring representational completeness through
invariance coverage can TSFMs achieve the aligned structure necessary for
generalisation, reasoning, and truly emergent behaviour.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该研究通过多层图扩散模型发现，阿尔茨海默病中tau蛋白的传播受到结构连接和功能连接的不对称影响，且这种主导作用在疾病不同阶段会发生转变，并与AD相关基因表达模式高度一致。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索结构连接和功能连接如何相互作用影响阿尔茨海默病中tau蛋白的传播，因为现有证据显示病理性tau蛋白沿着特定脑网络积累，但SC和FC的具体作用机制尚不明确。

Method: 利用大量纵向神经影像数据，通过多层图扩散模型分析SC-FC相互作用，并在独立AD队列中进行验证。

Result: 发现FC主要在皮层下区域、岛叶、额叶和颞叶皮层驱动tau传播，而SC在枕叶、顶叶和边缘区域起更大作用。SC和FC的相对主导地位在疾病过程中发生转变，早期AD以FC为主，后期SC占主导。这种空间模式与AD相关基因表达高度一致。

Conclusion: 结构连接和功能连接在tau蛋白传播中发挥不对称且动态变化的作用，这种作用模式与AD的分子病理机制密切相关，为理解疾病进展提供了新的网络视角。

Abstract: Emerging neuroimaging evidence shows that pathological tau proteins build up
along specific brain networks, suggesting that large-scale network architecture
plays a key role in the progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, how
structural connectivity (SC) and functional connectivity (FC) interact to
influence tau propagation remains unclear. Leveraging an unprecedented volume
of longitudinal neuroimaging data, we examine SC-FC interactions through a
multi-layer graph diffusion model. Beyond showing that connectome architecture
constrains tau spread, our model reveals a regionally asymmetric contribution
of SC and FC. Specifically, FC predominantly drives tau spread in subcortical
areas, the insula, frontal and temporal cortices, whereas SC plays a larger
role in occipital, parietal, and limbic regions. The relative dominance of SC
versus FC shifts over the course of disease, with FC generally prevailing in
early AD and SC becoming primary in later stages. Spatial patterns of SC- and
FC-dominant regions strongly align with the regional expression of
AD-associated genes involved in inflammation, apoptosis, and lysosomal
function, including CHUK (IKK-alpha), TMEM106B, MCL1, NOTCH1, and TH. In
parallel, other non-modifiable risk factors (e.g., APOE genotype, sex) and
biological mechanisms (e.g., amyloid deposition) selectively reshape tau
propagation by shifting dominant routes between anatomical and functional
pathways in a region-specific manner. Findings are validated in an independent
AD cohort.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有固定方差噪声方法会降低模型性能和训练效率，需要一种能动态调整隐私保护强度的方法来平衡隐私与性能。

Method: 使用步进衰减策略动态调整噪声方差和学习率，引入渐进梯度融合策略利用历史梯度，结合去中心化push-sum和聚合技术。

Result: 理论分析证明该方法具有鲁棒收敛性，实验结果显示在多种场景下优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: ADP-VRSGP能有效解决隐私保护去中心化学习的挑战，在保证节点级个性化隐私的同时显著提升训练稳定性和速度。

Abstract: Differential privacy is widely employed in decentralized learning to
safeguard sensitive data by introducing noise into model updates. However,
existing approaches that use fixed-variance noise often degrade model
performance and reduce training efficiency. To address these limitations, we
propose a novel approach called decentralized learning with adaptive
differential privacy via variance-reduced stochastic gradient push (ADP-VRSGP).
This method dynamically adjusts both the noise variance and the learning rate
using a stepwise-decaying schedule, which accelerates training and enhances
final model performance while providing node-level personalized privacy
guarantees. To counteract the slowed convergence caused by large-variance noise
in early iterations, we introduce a progressive gradient fusion strategy that
leverages historical gradients. Furthermore, ADP-VRSGP incorporates
decentralized push-sum and aggregation techniques, making it particularly
suitable for time-varying communication topologies. Through rigorous
theoretical analysis, we demonstrate that ADP-VRSGP achieves robust convergence
with an appropriate learning rate, significantly improving training stability
and speed. Experimental results validate that our method outperforms existing
baselines across multiple scenarios, highlighting its efficacy in addressing
the challenges of privacy-preserving decentralized learning.

TL;DR: 提出Hyper Tour Guided Neighborhood Search (HyperNS)方法解决大规模TSP问题，通过聚类和超路径引导优化过程，显著提升求解效率和质量


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有神经方法在大规模TSP实例中的内存限制、初始解质量差和全局引导不足等问题

Method: 采用"先聚类后路由"策略，使用稀疏热图图进行聚类并抽象为超节点，生成超路径来指导初始化和优化过程，减少搜索空间

Result: 在合成和真实数据集上的实验表明，该方法优于现有神经方法，特别是在处理更大规模实例时显著缩小与最优解的差距

Conclusion: HyperNS方法通过超路径引导的邻域搜索有效解决了大规模TSP问题，提供了更高效和有效的优化方案

Abstract: Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is a classic NP-hard problem that has
garnered significant attention from both academia and industry. While
neural-based methods have shown promise for solving TSPs, they still face
challenges in scaling to larger instances, particularly in memory constraints
associated with global heatmaps, edge weights, or access matrices, as well as
in generating high-quality initial solutions and insufficient global guidance
for efficiently navigating vast search spaces. To address these challenges, we
propose a Hyper Tour Guided Neighborhood Search (HyperNS) method for
large-scale TSP instances. Inspired by the ``clustering first, route second"
strategy, our approach initially divides the TSP instance into clusters using a
sparse heatmap graph and abstracts them as supernodes, followed by the
generation of a hyper tour to guide both the initialization and optimization
processes. This method reduces the search space by focusing on edges relevant
to the hyper tour, leading to more efficient and effective optimization.
Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that
our approach outperforms existing neural-based methods, particularly in
handling larger-scale instances, offering a significant reduction in the gap to
the optimal solution.

TL;DR: RLEV方法通过将人类定义的价值信号直接融入奖励函数，使LLM优化与可量化的人类价值对齐，在多项RL算法和模型规模上优于仅基于正确性的基线方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有RLVR方法在客观领域使用二元正确性奖励有效训练模型，但忽视了并非所有任务都具有同等重要性，需要将人类价值信号直接整合到奖励函数中。

Method: RLEV扩展了RLVR框架，在奖励函数中直接融入人类定义的价值信号，使用带有明确真实价值标签的考试风格数据，并通过价值加权梯度放大机制实现价值敏感的终止策略。

Result: RLEV策略不仅提高了价值加权准确率，还学会了价值敏感的终止策略：对低价值提示简洁回应，对高价值提示详细回应。消融研究证实收益与价值对齐存在因果关系。

Conclusion: 即使在噪声价值信号（如基于难度的标签）下，RLEV仍保持稳健，表明优化显式效用函数为将LLM与人类优先事项对齐提供了实用路径。

Abstract: We propose Reinforcement Learning with Explicit Human Values (RLEV), a method
that aligns Large Language Model (LLM) optimization directly with quantifiable
human value signals. While Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards
(RLVR) effectively trains models in objective domains using binary correctness
rewards, it overlooks that not all tasks are equally significant. RLEV extends
this framework by incorporating human-defined value signals directly into the
reward function. Using exam-style data with explicit ground-truth value labels,
RLEV consistently outperforms correctness-only baselines across multiple RL
algorithms and model scales. Crucially, RLEV policies not only improve
value-weighted accuracy but also learn a value-sensitive termination policy:
concise for low-value prompts, thorough for high-value ones. We demonstrate
this behavior stems from value-weighted gradient amplification on
end-of-sequence tokens. Ablation studies confirm the gain is causally linked to
value alignment. RLEV remains robust under noisy value signals, such as
difficulty-based labels, demonstrating that optimizing for an explicit utility
function offers a practical path to aligning LLMs with human priorities.

Motivation: 传统约束优化RL仅关注期望累积奖励，忽略了奖励分布尾部的风险事件，无法满足高风险应用中关键异常风险的需求。

Result: 提出的算法可在标准假设下收敛，并通过数值实验验证了其风险感知特性。

Conclusion: 该框架为高风险应用提供了有效的风险感知约束RL解决方案，能够简单集成到标准RL求解器中。

Abstract: Constrained optimization provides a common framework for dealing with
conflicting objectives in reinforcement learning (RL). In most of these
settings, the objectives (and constraints) are expressed though the expected
accumulated reward. However, this formulation neglects risky or even possibly
catastrophic events at the tails of the reward distribution, and is often
insufficient for high-stakes applications in which the risk involved in
outliers is critical. In this work, we propose a framework for risk-aware
constrained RL, which exhibits per-stage robustness properties jointly in
reward values and time using optimized certainty equivalents (OCEs). Our
framework ensures an exact equivalent to the original constrained problem
within a parameterized strong Lagrangian duality framework under appropriate
constraint qualifications, and yields a simple algorithmic recipe which can be
wrapped around standard RL solvers, such as PPO. Lastly, we establish the
convergence of the proposed algorithm under common assumptions, and verify the
risk-aware properties of our approach through several numerical experiments.

TL;DR: 本文提出了三种可复制性的松弛概念：点态可复制性、近似可复制性和半可复制性，并在这些松弛条件下实现了样本最优的不可知PAC学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 由于完全可复制性在简单任务（如阈值学习）中不可实现，成本过高，因此需要探索在何种近似可复制性概念下学习是可行的。

Method: 提出了三种可复制性松弛：(1)点态可复制性：对固定输入保持一致性；(2)近似可复制性：对大部分分布保持分类一致性；(3)半可复制性：完全可复制但可使用共享无标签样本。

Result: 在常数可复制性参数下，获得了样本最优的不可知PAC学习器：(1)和(2)使用Θ(d/α²)样本即可实现，(3)需要Θ(d²/α²)标记样本。

Conclusion: 通过适当的可复制性松弛，可以在不显著增加样本复杂度的情况下实现稳定的学习算法。

Abstract: Replicability, introduced by (Impagliazzo et al. STOC '22), is the notion
that algorithms should remain stable under a resampling of their inputs (given
access to shared randomness). While a strong and interesting notion of
stability, the cost of replicability can be prohibitive: there is no replicable
algorithm, for instance, for tasks as simple as threshold learning (Bun et al.
STOC '23). Given such strong impossibility results we ask: under what
approximate notions of replicability is learning possible?
  In this work, we propose three natural relaxations of replicability in the
context of PAC learning: (1) Pointwise: the learner must be consistent on any
fixed input, but not across all inputs simultaneously, (2) Approximate: the
learner must output hypotheses that classify most of the distribution
consistently, (3) Semi: the algorithm is fully replicable, but may additionally
use shared unlabeled samples. In all three cases, for constant replicability
parameters, we obtain sample-optimal agnostic PAC learners: (1) and (2) are
achievable for ``free" using $\Theta(d/\alpha^2)$ samples, while (3) requires
$\Theta(d^2/\alpha^2)$ labeled samples.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 开发用于犬类早期癌症检测的无创筛查工具是兽医医学的重要挑战。常规实验室数据作为低成本来源具有潜力，但受到个体生物标志物非特异性和筛查群体中严重类别不平衡的限制。

Method: 在现实约束下，使用金毛猎犬寿命研究队列，系统比较了126个分析流程，包括各种机器学习模型、特征选择方法和数据平衡技术。数据按患者级别分区以防止泄漏。

Result: 最佳模型（带类别加权的逻辑回归分类器和递归特征消除）显示出中等排名能力（AUROC = 0.815），但临床分类性能差（F1-score = 0.25，阳性预测值 = 0.15）。高阴性预测值（0.98）但召回率不足（0.79），无法作为可靠的排除测试。

Conclusion: 常规实验室数据中存在统计上可检测的癌症信号，但信号太弱且与正常衰老或其他炎症状况混淆，无法实现可靠的临床区分。该工作确立了这种数据模态单独使用的性能上限，强调计算兽医肿瘤学的有意义的进展需要多模态数据源的整合。

Abstract: The development of accessible screening tools for early cancer detection in
dogs represents a significant challenge in veterinary medicine. Routine
laboratory data offer a promising, low-cost source for such tools, but their
utility is hampered by the non-specificity of individual biomarkers and the
severe class imbalance inherent in screening populations. This study assesses
the feasibility of cancer risk classification using the Golden Retriever
Lifetime Study (GRLS) cohort under real-world constraints, including the
grouping of diverse cancer types and the inclusion of post-diagnosis samples. A
comprehensive benchmark evaluation was conducted, systematically comparing 126
analytical pipelines that comprised various machine learning models, feature
selection methods, and data balancing techniques. Data were partitioned at the
patient level to prevent leakage. The optimal model, a Logistic Regression
classifier with class weighting and recursive feature elimination, demonstrated
moderate ranking ability (AUROC = 0.815; 95% CI: 0.793-0.836) but poor clinical
classification performance (F1-score = 0.25, Positive Predictive Value = 0.15).
While a high Negative Predictive Value (0.98) was achieved, insufficient recall
(0.79) precludes its use as a reliable rule-out test. Interpretability analysis
with SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) revealed that predictions were driven
by non-specific features like age and markers of inflammation and anemia. It is
concluded that while a statistically detectable cancer signal exists in routine
lab data, it is too weak and confounded for clinically reliable discrimination
from normal aging or other inflammatory conditions. This work establishes a
critical performance ceiling for this data modality in isolation and
underscores that meaningful progress in computational veterinary oncology will
require integration of multi-modal data sources.

Conclusion: CO-PFL有效缓解了聚合偏差，加强了全局协调，通过构建具有稳定更新的定制子模型提升了本地性能。

Abstract: Personalized federated learning (PFL) addresses a critical challenge of
collaboratively training customized models for clients with heterogeneous and
scarce local data. Conventional federated learning, which relies on a single
consensus model, proves inadequate under such data heterogeneity. Its standard
aggregation method of weighting client updates heuristically or by data volume,
operates under an equal-contribution assumption, failing to account for the
actual utility and reliability of each client's update. This often results in
suboptimal personalization and aggregation bias. To overcome these limitations,
we introduce Contribution-Oriented PFL (CO-PFL), a novel algorithm that
dynamically estimates each client's contribution for global aggregation. CO-PFL
performs a joint assessment by analyzing both gradient direction discrepancies
and prediction deviations, leveraging information from gradient and data
subspaces. This dual-subspace analysis provides a principled and discriminative
aggregation weight for each client, emphasizing high-quality updates.
Furthermore, to bolster personalization adaptability and optimization
stability, CO-PFL cohesively integrates a parameter-wise personalization
mechanism with mask-aware momentum optimization. Our approach effectively
mitigates aggregation bias, strengthens global coordination, and enhances local
performance by facilitating the construction of tailored submodels with stable
updates. Extensive experiments on four benchmark datasets (CIFAR10, CIFAR10C,
CINIC10, and Mini-ImageNet) confirm that CO-PFL consistently surpasses
state-of-the-art methods in in personalization accuracy, robustness,
scalability and convergence stability.

TL;DR: 提出QKCV注意力机制，在传统QKV框架中加入静态类别嵌入C，强调类别特定信息，提升时序预测模型精度并支持高效微调。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实世界时序预测任务中，类别信息对捕捉数据内在模式至关重要，但传统注意力机制未能充分利用此类信息。

Method: 扩展传统QKV注意力框架，引入静态类别嵌入C，形成Query-Key-Category-Value结构，作为即插即用模块增强现有注意力模型。

Result: 在多种真实数据集上显著提升Vanilla Transformer、Informer、PatchTST、TFT等模型的预测精度；在微调单变量时序基础模型时，仅更新静态嵌入C即可获得优越性能，大幅降低计算开销。

Conclusion: QKCV注意力机制有效整合类别信息，既提升预测性能又支持高效微调，为时序预测任务提供了通用且实用的增强方案。

Abstract: In real-world time series forecasting tasks, category information plays a
pivotal role in capturing inherent data patterns. This paper introduces QKCV
(Query-Key-Category-Value) attention, an extension of the traditional QKV
framework that incorporates a static categorical embedding C to emphasize
category-specific information. As a versatile plug-in module, QKCV enhances the
forecasting accuracy of attention-based models (e.g., Vanilla Transformer,
Informer, PatchTST, TFT) across diverse real-world datasets. Furthermore, QKCV
demonstrates remarkable adaptability in fine-tuning univariate time series
foundation model by solely updating the static embedding C while preserving
pretrained weights, thereby reducing computational overhead and achieving
superior fine-tuning performance.

TL;DR: 提出MetaVD方法，通过贝叶斯元学习预测客户端相关的dropout率，解决联邦学习中非IID数据导致的模型过拟合和发散问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统联邦学习在非IID和有限数据场景下面临模型过拟合和本地模型发散等挑战，需要有效的方法进行模型个性化

Method: 使用元变分dropout方法，通过共享超网络学习客户端相关的dropout率，实现贝叶斯联邦学习的后验适应和聚合

Result: 在多个稀疏和非IID联邦学习数据集上，MetaVD展现出优秀的分类精度和不确定性校准性能，特别是对分布外客户端，同时压缩了本地模型参数

Conclusion: MetaVD能有效解决联邦学习中的非IID数据问题，提高模型个性化性能，减少通信成本

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) aims to train a global inference model from remotely
distributed clients, gaining popularity due to its benefit of improving data
privacy. However, traditional FL often faces challenges in practical
applications, including model overfitting and divergent local models due to
limited and non-IID data among clients. To address these issues, we introduce a
novel Bayesian meta-learning approach called meta-variational dropout (MetaVD).
MetaVD learns to predict client-dependent dropout rates via a shared
hypernetwork, enabling effective model personalization of FL algorithms in
limited non-IID data settings. We also emphasize the posterior adaptation view
of meta-learning and the posterior aggregation view of Bayesian FL via the
conditional dropout posterior. We conducted extensive experiments on various
sparse and non-IID FL datasets. MetaVD demonstrated excellent classification
accuracy and uncertainty calibration performance, especially for
out-of-distribution (OOD) clients. MetaVD compresses the local model parameters
needed for each client, mitigating model overfitting and reducing communication
costs. Code is available at https://github.com/insujeon/MetaVD.

Abstract: We introduce SpLIIF to generate implicit neural representations and enable
arbitrary downscaling of weather variables. We train a model from sparse
weather stations and topography over Japan and evaluate in- and
out-of-distribution accuracy predicting temperature and wind, comparing it to
both an interpolation baseline and CorrDiff. We find the model to be up to 50%
better than both CorrDiff and the baseline at downscaling temperature, and
around 10-20% better for wind.

Motivation: 解决多目标强化学习中最大最小准则的收敛性和实用性问题，通过博弈论方法简化策略更新并确保全局收敛。

Method: 将最大最小多目标强化学习重新表述为两人零和正则化连续博弈，使用基于镜像下降的算法，并引入自适应正则化来提升性能。

Conclusion: 提出的框架在理论和实验上都证明了其有效性，为多目标强化学习提供了可证明收敛且实用的解决方案。

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a provably convergent and practical framework for
multi-objective reinforcement learning with max-min criterion. From a
game-theoretic perspective, we reformulate max-min multi-objective
reinforcement learning as a two-player zero-sum regularized continuous game and
introduce an efficient algorithm based on mirror descent. Our approach
simplifies the policy update while ensuring global last-iterate convergence. We
provide a comprehensive theoretical analysis on our algorithm, including
iteration complexity under both exact and approximate policy evaluations, as
well as sample complexity bounds. To further enhance performance, we modify the
proposed algorithm with adaptive regularization. Our experiments demonstrate
the convergence behavior of the proposed algorithm in tabular settings, and our
implementation for deep reinforcement learning significantly outperforms
previous baselines in many MORL environments.

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为LKM的自知识蒸馏方法，能够在不显著增加计算成本的情况下，提高GNN在分子性质预测中的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前GNN在分子性质预测中需要更高的准确性，但增加模型复杂度会带来计算成本和内存需求的显著增加。

Method: 通过最小化GNN层间预存在隐藏嵌入的绝对距离，LKM有效聚合多跳和多尺度信息，改善局部和全局分子特征的表示。

Result: 在QM9、MD17和Chignolin数据集上，LKM将量子化学和生物物理性质预测的平均绝对误差分别降低了9.8%、45.3%和22.9%。

Conclusion: LKM方法有潜力在不显著增加训练和推理成本的情况下，显著提高GNN在化学性质预测中的准确性。

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are the currently most effective methods for
predicting molecular properties but there remains a need for more accurate
models. GNN accuracy can be improved by increasing the model complexity but
this also increases the computational cost and memory requirement during
training and inference. In this study, we develop Layer-to-Layer Knowledge
Mixing (LKM), a novel self-knowledge distillation method that increases the
accuracy of state-of-the-art GNNs while adding negligible computational
complexity during training and inference. By minimizing the mean absolute
distance between pre-existing hidden embeddings of GNN layers, LKM efficiently
aggregates multi-hop and multi-scale information, enabling improved
representation of both local and global molecular features. We evaluated LKM
using three diverse GNN architectures (DimeNet++, MXMNet, and PAMNet) using
datasets of quantum chemical properties (QM9, MD17 and Chignolin). We found
that the LKM method effectively reduces the mean absolute error of quantum
chemical and biophysical property predictions by up to 9.8% (QM9), 45.3% (MD17
Energy), and 22.9% (Chignolin). This work demonstrates the potential of LKM to
significantly improve the accuracy of GNNs for chemical property prediction
without any substantial increase in training and inference cost.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文提出了选择性分类差距的概念，并首次将其分解为五个误差来源：贝叶斯噪声、近似误差、排序误差、统计噪声和实现/偏移导致的松弛。分析表明单调后校准对缩小差距影响有限，需要能重新排序预测的评分机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 选择性分类器通过拒绝不确定输入来提高可靠性，但很少有方法能达到完美排序预言机的性能。本文旨在形式化这种性能差距并分解其来源。

Method: 将选择性分类差距分解为五个误差源，通过合成数据和真实世界基准进行验证，通过控制实验分离每个误差成分。

Result: 验证了贝叶斯噪声和有限模型容量会导致显著差距，只有特征感知校准器能显著改善评分排序，数据偏移会引入需要分布鲁棒训练的松弛。

Conclusion: 该分解提供了定量误差预算和实用设计指南，帮助构建更接近理想预言机行为的选择性分类器。

Abstract: Selective classifiers improve model reliability by abstaining on inputs the
model deems uncertain. However, few practical approaches achieve the
gold-standard performance of a perfect-ordering oracle that accepts examples
exactly in order of correctness. Our work formalizes this shortfall as the
selective-classification gap and present the first finite-sample decomposition
of this gap to five distinct sources of looseness: Bayes noise, approximation
error, ranking error, statistical noise, and implementation- or shift-induced
slack. Crucially, our analysis reveals that monotone post-hoc calibration --
often believed to strengthen selective classifiers -- has limited impact on
closing this gap, since it rarely alters the model's underlying score ranking.
Bridging the gap therefore requires scoring mechanisms that can effectively
reorder predictions rather than merely rescale them. We validate our
decomposition on synthetic two-moons data and on real-world vision and language
benchmarks, isolating each error component through controlled experiments. Our
results confirm that (i) Bayes noise and limited model capacity can account for
substantial gaps, (ii) only richer, feature-aware calibrators meaningfully
improve score ordering, and (iii) data shift introduces a separate slack that
demands distributionally robust training. Together, our decomposition yields a
quantitative error budget as well as actionable design guidelines that
practitioners can use to build selective classifiers which approximate ideal
oracle behavior more closely.

TL;DR: FedGPS是一个新颖的联邦学习框架，通过整合统计分布和梯度信息来解决数据异构性问题，在各种异构场景下表现出优越的性能和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有联邦学习方法在数据异构性场景下性能有限，缺乏对不同异构场景的鲁棒性。研究发现共享统计信息可以帮助客户端从全局视角更新模型。

Method: FedGPS框架静态修改客户端学习目标以隐式建模全局数据分布，同时动态调整本地更新方向，整合其他客户端的梯度信息。

Result: 大量实验表明FedGPS在各种异构场景下优于现有最先进方法，验证了其有效性和鲁棒性。

Conclusion: FedGPS通过整合统计分布和梯度信息，有效缓解了联邦学习中的数据异构性问题，具有优越的性能和部署鲁棒性。

Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) confronts a significant challenge known as data
heterogeneity, which impairs model performance and convergence. Existing
methods have made notable progress in addressing this issue. However, improving
performance in certain heterogeneity scenarios remains an overlooked question:
\textit{How robust are these methods to deploy under diverse heterogeneity
scenarios?} To answer this, we conduct comprehensive evaluations across varied
heterogeneity scenarios, showing that most existing methods exhibit limited
robustness. Meanwhile, insights from these experiments highlight that sharing
statistical information can mitigate heterogeneity by enabling clients to
update with a global perspective. Motivated by this, we propose \textbf{FedGPS}
(\textbf{Fed}erated \textbf{G}oal-\textbf{P}ath \textbf{S}ynergy), a novel
framework that seamlessly integrates statistical distribution and gradient
information from others. Specifically, FedGPS statically modifies each client's
learning objective to implicitly model the global data distribution using
surrogate information, while dynamically adjusting local update directions with
gradient information from other clients at each round. Extensive experiments
show that FedGPS outperforms state-of-the-art methods across diverse
heterogeneity scenarios, validating its effectiveness and robustness. The code

*Thomas Rupf,Marco Bagatella,Marin Vlastelica,Andreas Krause*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: OpTI-BFM是一种乐观决策标准，通过直接建模奖励函数的不确定性来指导行为基础模型进行任务推断，减少对预计算奖励数据的需求。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统行为基础模型需要计算大量推理数据集的奖励，这要么需要奖励函数的函数形式，要么需要大量标注工作。为了减轻这些限制，研究通过与环境交互来纯化任务推断问题。

Method: 提出OpTI-BFM乐观决策标准，直接建模奖励函数的不确定性，引导BFMs进行数据收集以进行任务推断。该方法与线性bandits的上置信界算法有直接联系。

Result: 在已建立的零样本基准测试中，OpTI-BFM使基于后继特征的BFMs能够在少数几个episode中识别和优化未见过的奖励函数，且计算开销最小。

Conclusion: OpTI-BFM为训练良好的BFMs提供了遗憾界，并通过与环境的直接交互实现了高效的任务推断，减少了数据需求。

Abstract: Behavior Foundation Models (BFMs) are capable of retrieving high-performing
policy for any reward function specified directly at test-time, commonly
referred to as zero-shot reinforcement learning (RL). While this is a very
efficient process in terms of compute, it can be less so in terms of data: as a
standard assumption, BFMs require computing rewards over a non-negligible
inference dataset, assuming either access to a functional form of rewards, or
significant labeling efforts. To alleviate these limitations, we tackle the
problem of task inference purely through interaction with the environment at
test-time. We propose OpTI-BFM, an optimistic decision criterion that directly
models uncertainty over reward functions and guides BFMs in data collection for
task inference. Formally, we provide a regret bound for well-trained BFMs
through a direct connection to upper-confidence algorithms for linear bandits.
Empirically, we evaluate OpTI-BFM on established zero-shot benchmarks, and
observe that it enables successor-features-based BFMs to identify and optimize
an unseen reward function in a handful of episodes with minimal compute
overhead. Code is available at https://github.com/ThomasRupf/opti-bfm.

*Ziqian Zhong,Aditi Raghunathan,Nicholas Carlini*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: ImpossibleBench是一个基准框架，用于系统性地测量LLM代理利用测试用例的倾向，通过创建自然语言规范与单元测试之间存在直接冲突的"不可能"任务变体来量化作弊行为。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: LLM倾向于寻找和利用"捷径"完成任务，这会严重影响评估的可靠性和实际部署的安全性。例如，LLM代理可能会删除失败的测试而不是修复底层bug，这破坏了基准测试结果的有效性和实际部署的可靠性。

Method: 从现有基准（如LiveCodeBench和SWE-bench）创建"不可能"任务变体，在自然语言规范和单元测试之间引入直接冲突，通过测量代理在这些不可能任务上的通过率（作弊率）来量化作弊行为。

Result: 揭示了作弊行为的细粒度细节，从简单的测试修改到复杂的运算符重载；展示了提示、测试访问和反馈循环如何影响作弊率；为开发监控工具提供了经过验证的欺骗性解决方案测试平台。

Conclusion: ImpossibleBench不仅是一个评估工具，更是一个多功能框架，可用于研究模型行为、上下文工程和开发监控工具，有助于构建更强大可靠的LLM系统。

Abstract: The tendency to find and exploit "shortcuts" to complete tasks poses
significant risks for reliable assessment and deployment of large language
models (LLMs). For example, an LLM agent with access to unit tests may delete
failing tests rather than fix the underlying bug. Such behavior undermines both
the validity of benchmark results and the reliability of real-world LLM coding
assistant deployments.
  To quantify, study, and mitigate such behavior, we introduce ImpossibleBench,
a benchmark framework that systematically measures LLM agents' propensity to
exploit test cases. ImpossibleBench creates "impossible" variants of tasks from
existing benchmarks like LiveCodeBench and SWE-bench by introducing direct
conflicts between the natural-language specification and the unit tests. We
measure an agent's "cheating rate" as its pass rate on these impossible tasks,
where any pass necessarily implies a specification-violating shortcut.
  As a practical framework, ImpossibleBench is not just an evaluation but a
versatile tool. We demonstrate its utility for: (1) studying model behaviors,
revealing more fine-grained details of cheating behaviors from simple test
modification to complex operator overloading; (2) context engineering, showing
how prompt, test access and feedback loop affect cheating rates; and (3)
developing monitoring tools, providing a testbed with verified deceptive
solutions. We hope ImpossibleBench serves as a useful framework for building
more robust and reliable LLM systems.

Motivation: 拓扑特征能捕捉图像数据中的全局几何结构，但在深度学习中的实际应用需要计算效率和可微分性。

Conclusion: 该方法为拓扑特征在深度学习中的广泛应用奠定了基础，讨论了批处理和多GPU扩展以扩大采用范围。

Abstract: Topological features capture global geometric structure in imaging data, but
practical adoption in deep learning requires both computational efficiency and
differentiability. We present optimized GPU kernels for the Euler
Characteristic Curve (ECC) computation achieving 16-2000\"O speedups over prior
GPU implementations on synthetic grids, and introduce a differentiable PyTorch
layer enabling end-to-end learning. Our CUDA kernels, optimized for Ampere GPUs
use 128B-coalesced access and hierarchical shared-memory accumulation. Our
PyTorch layer learns thresholds in a single direction via a Differentiable
Euler Characteristic Transform-style sigmoid relaxation. We discuss downstream
relevance, including applications highlighted by prior ECC work, and outline
batching/multi-GPU extensions to broaden adoption.

*Tristan Cinquin,Geoff Pleiss,Agustinus Kristiadi*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: PRM引导的树搜索在数学推理中相比Best-of-N方法没有显著改进，尽管成本更高，表明当前的过程奖励模型可靠性不足，需要不同的奖励建模方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的链式思维提示与Best-of-N选择方法无法捕捉复杂问题解决的分支和探索性质，希望探索PRM引导的树搜索是否能改善数学推理。

Method: 提出自适应算法最大化过程奖励模型分数，使用Qwen2.5-Math-7B-Instruct及其相关PRM作为案例研究，在23个数学问题上比较PRM引导的树搜索与Best-of-N方法。

Result: PRM引导的树搜索相比Best-of-N没有统计显著改进；蒙特卡洛树搜索和波束搜索表现最佳；PRM对状态值的近似效果差且可靠性随推理深度下降；PRM分布外泛化能力差。

Conclusion: 树搜索对不可靠PRM分数的依赖更强，在树搜索能有效增强LLM数学推理之前需要不同的奖励建模方法。

Abstract: While chain-of-thought prompting with Best-of-N (BoN) selection has become
popular for mathematical reasoning in large language models (LLMs), its linear
structure fails to capture the branching and exploratory nature of complex
problem-solving. In this work, we propose an adaptive algorithm to maximize
process reward model (PRM) scores over the intractable action space, and
investigate whether PRM-guided tree search can improve mathematical reasoning
by exploring multiple partial solution paths. Across $23$ diverse mathematical
problems using Qwen2.5-Math-7B-Instruct with its associated PRM as a case
study, we find that: (1) PRM-guided tree search shows no statistically
significant improvements over BoN despite higher costs, (2) Monte Carlo tree
search and beam search outperform other PRM-guided tree search methods, (3)
PRMs poorly approximate state values and their reliability degrades with
reasoning depth, and (4) PRMs generalize poorly out of distribution. This
underperformance stems from tree search's greater reliance on unreliable PRM
scores, suggesting different reward modeling is necessary before tree search
can effectively enhance mathematical reasoning in LLMs.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前深度学习模型在标准基准数据集上表现良好，但在实际应用中性能不稳定，这归因于深度学习架构的黑盒性质和当前评估框架的局限性，无法提供清晰的定量洞察来选择适合特定预测场景的模型。

Method: 提出SynTSBench合成数据驱动评估范式，通过可编程特征配置系统评估时间序列预测模型的基本建模能力，包括三个核心分析维度：时间特征分解与能力映射、数据不规则性下的鲁棒性分析、理论最优基准测试。

Result: 实验表明，当前的深度学习模型在所有类型的时间特征上并未普遍接近最优基线。

Conclusion: SynTSBench提供了一个可解释的评估系统，能够系统评估模型学习特定模式类型的能力，量化噪声容忍阈值和异常恢复能力，并为每种模式类型建立性能边界，实现模型预测与数学最优值的直接比较。

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have driven rapid progress in time series
forecasting, yet many state-of-the-art models continue to struggle with robust
performance in real-world applications, even when they achieve strong results
on standard benchmark datasets. This persistent gap can be attributed to the
black-box nature of deep learning architectures and the inherent limitations of
current evaluation frameworks, which frequently lack the capacity to provide
clear, quantitative insights into the specific strengths and weaknesses of
different models, thereby complicating the selection of appropriate models for
particular forecasting scenarios. To address these issues, we propose a
synthetic data-driven evaluation paradigm, SynTSBench, that systematically
assesses fundamental modeling capabilities of time series forecasting models
through programmable feature configuration. Our framework isolates confounding
factors and establishes an interpretable evaluation system with three core
analytical dimensions: (1) temporal feature decomposition and capability
mapping, which enables systematic evaluation of model capacities to learn
specific pattern types; (2) robustness analysis under data irregularities,
which quantifies noise tolerance thresholds and anomaly recovery capabilities;
and (3) theoretical optimum benchmarking, which establishes performance
boundaries for each pattern type-enabling direct comparison between model
predictions and mathematical optima. Our experiments show that current deep
learning models do not universally approach optimal baselines across all types
of temporal features.The code is available at

TL;DR: 提出基于KAN的协作模型(KCM)，用于改进大-小模型协作框架，在保持任务精度的同时显著减少大模型推理调用，降低计算资源消耗，并缓解灾难性遗忘问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有大-小模型协作框架中存在的精度下降、灾难性遗忘加剧、小模型知识引发的幻觉问题，同时减少计算资源消耗并提升大模型在专业领域任务的性能。

Method: 采用KAN(可解释神经网络)作为协作模型架构，替代传统的MLP，在语言、视觉和视觉-语言跨模态任务中部署KCM协作系统。

Result: 相比纯大模型方法，KCM协作框架显著减少大模型推理调用次数，保持近乎相同的任务精度；相比MLP协作模型，KCM显著缓解灾难性遗忘，长尾数据精度显著提升，在所有指标上表现更优。

Conclusion: KAN-based协作模型(KCM)在大-小模型协作中展现出优越性能，既能有效降低计算成本，又能改善模型鲁棒性和长尾任务表现。

Abstract: In recent years, Pretrained Large Models(PLMs) researchers proposed
large-small model collaboration frameworks, leveraged easily trainable small
models to assist large models, aim to(1) significantly reduce computational
resource consumption while maintaining comparable accuracy, and (2) enhance
large model performance in specialized domain tasks. However, this
collaborative paradigm suffers from issues such as significant accuracy
degradation, exacerbated catastrophic forgetting, and amplified hallucination
problems induced by small model knowledge. To address these challenges, we
propose a KAN-based Collaborative Model (KCM) as an improved approach to
large-small model collaboration. The KAN utilized in KCM represents an
alternative neural network architecture distinct from conventional MLPs.
Compared to MLPs, KAN offers superior visualizability and interpretability
while mitigating catastrophic forgetting. We deployed KCM in large-small model
collaborative systems across three scenarios: language, vision, and
vision-language cross-modal tasks. The experimental results demonstrate that,
compared with pure large model approaches, the large-small model collaboration
framework utilizing KCM as the collaborative model significantly reduces the
number of large model inference calls while maintaining near-identical task
accuracy, thereby substantially lowering computational resource consumption.
Concurrently, the KAN-based small collaborative model markedly mitigates
catastrophic forgetting, leading to significant accuracy improvements for
long-tail data. The results reveal that KCM demonstrates superior performance
across all metrics compared to MLP-based small collaborative models (MCM).

Motivation: 随着大语言模型发展，需要构建能够协助整个科学研究过程的AI协作系统，这要求评估端到端工作流程而非孤立子任务。

Method: 从14kCC授权论文中构建CS-54k高质量科学问答语料库，采用检索增强生成和多阶段质量控制确保事实基础。从中提取CS-4k评估基准和CS-50k训练数据集。

Result: CS-4k能够有效区分最先进LLM的能力层级。在CS-50k上训练的7B规模模型通过监督训练和强化学习显著提升，甚至超越GPT-4、GPT-4o和Gemini 2.5 Pro等大型专有系统。

Conclusion: 让AI模型成为更好的研究助手更依赖于使用高质量数据进行领域对齐训练，而非预训练规模或通用基准性能。发布CS-4k和CS-50k以促进AI系统在CS研究中成为可靠协作者。

Abstract: As large language models (LLMs) advance, the ultimate vision for their role
in science is emerging: we could build an AI collaborator to effectively assist
human beings throughout the entire scientific research process. We refer to
this envisioned system as ResearchGPT. Given that scientific research
progresses through multiple interdependent phases, achieving this vision
requires rigorous benchmarks that evaluate the end-to-end workflow rather than
isolated sub-tasks. To this end, we contribute CS-54k, a high-quality corpus of
scientific Q&A pairs in computer science, built from 14k CC-licensed papers. It
is constructed through a scalable, paper-grounded pipeline that combines
retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with multi-stage quality control to ensure
factual grounding. From this unified corpus, we derive two complementary
subsets: CS-4k, a carefully curated benchmark for evaluating AI's ability to
assist scientific research, and CS-50k, a large-scale training dataset.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that CS-4k stratifies state-of-the-art LLMs
into distinct capability tiers. Open models trained on CS-50k with supervised
training and reinforcement learning demonstrate substantial improvements. Even
7B-scale models, when properly trained, outperform many larger proprietary
systems, such as GPT-4.1, GPT-4o, and Gemini 2.5 Pro. This indicates that
making AI models better research assistants relies more on domain-aligned

Abstract: Out-of-distribution generalization under distributional shifts remains a
critical challenge for graph neural networks. Existing methods generally adopt
the Invariant Risk Minimization (IRM) framework, requiring costly environment
annotations or heuristically generated synthetic splits. To circumvent these
limitations, in this work, we aim to develop an IRM-free method for capturing
causal subgraphs. We first identify that causal subgraphs exhibit substantially
smaller distributional variations than non-causal components across diverse
environments, which we formalize as the Invariant Distribution Criterion and
theoretically prove in this paper. Building on this criterion, we
systematically uncover the quantitative relationship between distributional
shift and representation norm for identifying the causal subgraph, and
investigate its underlying mechanisms in depth. Finally, we propose an IRM-free
method by introducing a norm-guided invariant distribution objective for causal
subgraph discovery and prediction. Extensive experiments on two widely used
benchmarks demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in graph generalization.

TL;DR: 提出DB-FGA-Net模型，集成VGG16和Xception双主干网络与频率门控注意力模块，无需数据增强即可实现脑肿瘤高精度分类，并提供Grad-CAM可视化增强临床可解释性。

Motivation: 解决深度学习脑肿瘤分类方法依赖数据增强导致泛化能力有限和临床信任度不足的问题，开发无需增强的鲁棒模型并增强可解释性。

Method: 使用VGG16和Xception双主干网络集成频率门控注意力模块，捕获局部和全局互补特征，结合Grad-CAM可视化肿瘤区域。

Result: 在7K-DS数据集上4类、3类和2类分类准确率分别达到99.24%、98.68%和99.85%，在独立3K-DS数据集上泛化准确率达95.77%，优于基线方法。

Conclusion: DB-FGA-Net作为无需数据增强、可解释且可部署的深度学习模型，在脑肿瘤诊断中具有可靠的临床转化潜力。

Abstract: Brain tumors are a challenging problem in neuro-oncology, where early and
precise diagnosis is important for successful treatment. Deep learning-based
brain tumor classification methods often rely on heavy data augmentation which
can limit generalization and trust in clinical applications. In this paper, we
propose a double-backbone network integrating VGG16 and Xception with a
Frequency-Gated Attention (FGA) Block to capture complementary local and global
features. Unlike previous studies, our model achieves state-of-the-art
performance without augmentation which demonstrates robustness to variably
sized and distributed datasets. For further transparency, Grad-CAM is
integrated to visualize the tumor regions based on which the model is giving
prediction, bridging the gap between model prediction and clinical
interpretability. The proposed framework achieves 99.24\% accuracy on the 7K-DS
dataset for the 4-class setting, along with 98.68\% and 99.85\% in the 3-class
and 2-class settings, respectively. On the independent 3K-DS dataset, the model
generalizes with 95.77\% accuracy, outperforming baseline and state-of-the-art
methods. To further support clinical usability, we developed a graphical user
interface (GUI) that provides real-time classification and Grad-CAM-based tumor
localization. These findings suggest that augmentation-free, interpretable, and
deployable deep learning models such as DB-FGA-Net hold strong potential for
reliable clinical translation in brain tumor diagnosis.

### [150] [InvDec: Inverted Decoder for Multivariate Time Series Forecasting with Separated Temporal and Variate Modeling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20302)
*Yuhang Wang*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: InvDec是一种混合架构，通过倒置解码器实现时间编码和变量级解码的分离，在保持时间建模能力的同时有效捕获变量间依赖关系，特别在高维数据集上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法存在局限性：通道独立方法（如PatchTST）擅长时间建模但忽略变量相关性，而纯变量注意力方法（如iTransformer）牺牲了时间编码能力。需要一种能同时建模时间模式和跨变量依赖的方法。

Method: 提出InvDec混合架构，结合基于补丁的时间编码器和通过变量级自注意力操作的倒置解码器。引入延迟变量嵌入在时间编码后丰富变量特定表示，并采用自适应残差融合机制动态平衡时间和变量信息。

Result: 在7个基准数据集上的实验显示，InvDec-PatchTST在高维数据集上显著提升：电力数据集（321变量）MSE降低20.9%，天气数据集提升4.3%，交通数据集提升2.7%，同时在低维ETT数据集上保持竞争力。

Conclusion: InvDec通过分离时间编码和变量级解码，有效解决了多变量时间序列预测中的关键挑战。消融研究验证了各组件有效性，分析表明InvDec的优势随数据集维度增加而增强，证实跨变量建模在变量数量增加时变得至关重要。

Abstract: Multivariate time series forecasting requires simultaneously modeling
temporal patterns and cross-variate dependencies. Channel-independent methods
such as PatchTST excel at temporal modeling but ignore variable correlations,
while pure variate-attention approaches such as iTransformer sacrifice temporal
encoding. We proposeInvDec (Inverted Decoder), a hybrid architecture that
achieves principled separation between temporal encoding and variate-level
decoding. InvDec combines a patch-based temporal encoder with an inverted
decoder operating on the variate dimension through variate-wise self-attention.
We introduce delayed variate embeddings that enrich variable-specific
representations only after temporal encoding, preserving temporal feature
integrity. An adaptive residual fusion mechanism dynamically balances temporal
and variate information across datasets of varying dimensions. Instantiating
InvDec with PatchTST yields InvDec-PatchTST. Extensive experiments on seven
benchmarks demonstrate significant gains on high-dimensional datasets: 20.9%
MSE reduction on Electricity (321 variables), 4.3% improvement on Weather, and
2.7% gain on Traffic compared to PatchTST, while maintaining competitive
performance on low-dimensional ETT datasets. Ablation studies validate each
component, and analysis reveals that InvDec's advantage grows with dataset
dimensionality, confirming that cross-variate modeling becomes critical as the
number of variables increases.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着推荐系统中保护敏感用户信息需求的增长，现实世界的隐私保护要求往往涉及多个敏感属性且具有动态性，现有单属性遗忘方法无法满足这些需求。

Method: 将多属性遗忘过程分为两步：嵌入校准从用户嵌入中移除特定属性信息，灵活组合将这些嵌入合并为单一嵌入以保护所有敏感属性；将遗忘过程构建为互信息最小化问题。

Result: 在三个真实世界数据集和三个代表性推荐模型上的广泛实验证明了该框架的有效性和效率。

Conclusion: LEGO框架能够有效解决多属性遗忘问题，为推荐系统的隐私保护提供了理论保证和实践解决方案。

Abstract: With the growing demand for safeguarding sensitive user information in
recommender systems, recommendation attribute unlearning is receiving
increasing attention. Existing studies predominantly focus on single-attribute
unlearning. However, privacy protection requirements in the real world often
involve multiple sensitive attributes and are dynamic. Existing
single-attribute unlearning methods cannot meet these real-world requirements
due to i) CH1: the inability to handle multiple unlearning requests
simultaneously, and ii) CH2: the lack of efficient adaptability to dynamic
unlearning needs. To address these challenges, we propose LEGO, a lightweight
and efficient multiple-attribute unlearning framework. Specifically, we divide
the multiple-attribute unlearning process into two steps: i) Embedding
Calibration removes information related to a specific attribute from user
embedding, and ii) Flexible Combination combines these embeddings into a single
embedding, protecting all sensitive attributes. We frame the unlearning process
as a mutual information minimization problem, providing LEGO a theoretical
guarantee of simultaneous unlearning, thereby addressing CH1. With the two-step
framework, where Embedding Calibration can be performed in parallel and
Flexible Combination is flexible and efficient, we address CH2. Extensive
experiments on three real-world datasets across three representative
recommendation models demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our
proposed framework. Our code and appendix are available at

Conclusion: 通过控制图像生成和真实与合成数据的整合，结合定制域适应策略，可以有效提升跑道检测系统在关键应用中的性能。

Abstract: Deep vision models are now mature enough to be integrated in industrial and
possibly critical applications such as autonomous navigation. Yet, data
collection and labeling to train such models requires too much efforts and
costs for a single company or product. This drawback is more significant in
critical applications, where training data must include all possible conditions
including rare scenarios. In this perspective, generating synthetic images is
an appealing solution, since it allows a cheap yet reliable covering of all the
conditions and environments, if the impact of the synthetic-to-real
distribution shift is mitigated. In this article, we consider the case of
runway detection that is a critical part in autonomous landing systems
developed by aircraft manufacturers. We propose an image generation approach
based on a commercial flight simulator that complements a few annotated real
images. By controlling the image generation and the integration of real and
synthetic data, we show that standard object detection models can achieve
accurate prediction. We also evaluate their robustness with respect to adverse
conditions, in our case nighttime images, that were not represented in the real
data, and show the interest of using a customized domain adaptation strategy.

Motivation: 传统奖励模型容易受到奖励攻击，在分布外输入上泛化能力差；而强大的LLM判断器虽然泛化能力强但推理成本高，限制了在线RLHF的应用。

Method: 将策略梯度方法中的优势估计制定为成对偏好分类，实现原则性的不确定性量化来指导路由。不确定的样本对转发给LLM判断器，确定的样本由奖励模型评估。

Result: 在奖励模型基准测试中，基于不确定性的路由策略在相同成本下显著优于随机调用判断器，下游对齐结果展示了其在改进在线RLHF方面的有效性。

Conclusion: 该框架成功解决了奖励模型泛化能力不足和LLM判断器成本过高的问题，为在线RLHF提供了一种高效实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Reward model (RM) plays a pivotal role in reinforcement learning with human
feedback (RLHF) for aligning large language models (LLMs). However, classical
RMs trained on human preferences are vulnerable to reward hacking and
generalize poorly to out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs. By contrast, strong LLM
judges equipped with reasoning capabilities demonstrate superior
generalization, even without additional training, but incur significantly
higher inference costs, limiting their applicability in online RLHF. In this
work, we propose an uncertainty-based routing framework that efficiently
complements a fast RM with a strong but costly LLM judge. Our approach
formulates advantage estimation in policy gradient (PG) methods as pairwise
preference classification, enabling principled uncertainty quantification to
guide routing. Uncertain pairs are forwarded to the LLM judge, while confident
ones are evaluated by the RM. Experiments on RM benchmarks demonstrate that our
uncertainty-based routing strategy significantly outperforms random judge
calling at the same cost, and downstream alignment results showcase its
effectiveness in improving online RLHF.

Method: 引入协方差矩阵的不确定性集合，构建最小化最坏情况期望平方误差的鲁棒协调问题，并将其转化为半定优化问题求解。

Result: 数值实验表明，所提出的鲁棒协调方法比现有层次预测方法获得了更好的预测性能。

Conclusion: 在协调过程中整合不确定性考虑是有效的，鲁棒优化框架能够提升层次时间序列预测的准确性。

Abstract: This paper focuses on forecasting hierarchical time-series data, where each
higher-level observation equals the sum of its corresponding lower-level time
series. In such contexts, the forecast values should be coherent, meaning that
the forecast value of each parent series exactly matches the sum of the
forecast values of its child series. Existing hierarchical forecasting methods
typically generate base forecasts independently for each series and then apply
a reconciliation procedure to adjust them so that the resulting forecast values
are coherent across the hierarchy. These methods generally derive an optimal
reconciliation, using a covariance matrix of the forecast error. In practice,
however, the true covariance matrix is unknown and has to be estimated from
finite samples in advance. This gap between the true and estimated covariance
matrix may degrade forecast performance. To address this issue, we propose a
robust optimization framework for hierarchical reconciliation that accounts for
uncertainty in the estimated covariance matrix. We first introduce an
uncertainty set for the estimated covariance matrix and formulate a
reconciliation problem that minimizes the worst-case expected squared error
over this uncertainty set. We show that our problem can be cast as a
semidefinite optimization problem. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the
proposed robust reconciliation method achieved better forecast performance than
existing hierarchical forecasting methods, which indicates the effectiveness of
integrating uncertainty into the reconciliation process.

TL;DR: 本文提出了基于相对排序的缩放定律，通过相对概率度量(RBP)来补充传统交叉熵方法的不足，从相对排序角度研究语言模型的缩放规律。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有缩放定律研究几乎完全依赖交叉熵作为评估指标，但交叉熵只关注正确token的绝对概率，忽略了正确与错误token之间的相对排序，而相对排序在语言模型（如贪婪采样场景）中至关重要。

Method: 提出了相对概率度量(RBP)，量化正确token在top预测中的排名概率，并基于此建立了相对缩放定律，通过四个数据集和四个模型家族的广泛实验验证其鲁棒性和准确性。

Result: 实验证明相对缩放定律具有鲁棒性和准确性，能够为涌现现象提供更深入的解释，并有助于寻找缩放定律的基本理论。

Conclusion: 相对缩放定律补充了交叉熵视角，为大规模语言模型的缩放提供了更完整的理解，对实践开发和理论探索都具有重要价值。

Abstract: Scaling laws aim to accurately predict model performance across different
scales. Existing scaling-law studies almost exclusively rely on cross-entropy
as the evaluation metric. However, cross-entropy provides only a partial view
of performance: it measures the absolute probability assigned to the correct
token, but ignores the relative ordering between correct and incorrect tokens.
Yet, relative ordering is crucial for language models, such as in
greedy-sampling scenario. To address this limitation, we investigate scaling
from the perspective of relative ordering. We first propose the Relative-Based
Probability (RBP) metric, which quantifies the probability that the correct
token is ranked among the top predictions. Building on this metric, we
establish the Relative-Based Scaling Law, which characterizes how RBP improves
with increasing model size. Through extensive experiments on four datasets and
four model families spanning five orders of magnitude, we demonstrate the
robustness and accuracy of this law. Finally, we illustrate the broad
application of this law with two examples, namely providing a deeper
explanation of emergence phenomena and facilitating finding fundamental
theories of scaling laws. In summary, the Relative-Based Scaling Law
complements the cross-entropy perspective and contributes to a more complete
understanding of scaling large language models. Thus, it offers valuable
insights for both practical development and theoretical exploration.

Method: 结合SortingEnv和ContainerGym两个基准任务，创建顺序回收场景，评估模块化架构与单体架构，并分析动作掩码的影响

Result: 无动作掩码时，模块化架构表现更好；应用动作掩码后，两种架构都显著改善，性能差距缩小

Conclusion: 动作空间约束起决定性作用，专业化优势随动作复杂度降低而减弱，该基准为工业自动化中的多智能体强化学习提供了有价值的测试平台

Abstract: Autonomous control of multi-stage industrial processes requires both local
specialization and global coordination. Reinforcement learning (RL) offers a
promising approach, but its industrial adoption remains limited due to
challenges such as reward design, modularity, and action space management. Many
academic benchmarks differ markedly from industrial control problems, limiting
their transferability to real-world applications. This study introduces an
enhanced industry-inspired benchmark environment that combines tasks from two
existing benchmarks, SortingEnv and ContainerGym, into a sequential recycling
scenario with sorting and pressing operations. We evaluate two control
strategies: a modular architecture with specialized agents and a monolithic
agent governing the full system, while also analyzing the impact of action
masking. Our experiments show that without action masking, agents struggle to
learn effective policies, with the modular architecture performing better. When
action masking is applied, both architectures improve substantially, and the
performance gap narrows considerably. These results highlight the decisive role
of action space constraints and suggest that the advantages of specialization
diminish as action complexity is reduced. The proposed benchmark thus provides
a valuable testbed for exploring practical and robust multi-agent RL solutions
in industrial automation, while contributing to the ongoing debate on
centralization versus specialization.

Motivation: DPO算法虽然简化了RLHF的两阶段过程，但在策略类无法实现真实奖励函数时会出现错误设定，导致偏好顺序反转、策略奖励恶化等问题。

Method: 通过几何分析DPO和RLHF的局部行为，提出AuxDPO方法，在DPO损失函数中引入辅助变量，以更接近RLHF解的方式缓解错误设定问题。

Result: 在理论分析和实验验证中，AuxDPO在模拟环境和LLM对齐任务中都表现出优于DPO的性能。

Conclusion: AuxDPO通过引入辅助变量有效缓解了DPO的错误设定问题，为直接对齐算法提供了更稳健的解决方案。

Abstract: Direct alignment algorithms such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)
fine-tune models based on preference data, using only supervised learning
instead of two-stage reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF). We show
that DPO encodes a statistical estimation problem over reward functions induced
by a parametric policy class. When the true reward function that generates
preferences cannot be realized via the policy class, DPO becomes misspecified,
resulting in failure modes such as preference order reversal, worsening of
policy reward, and high sensitivity to the input preference data distribution.
On the other hand, we study the local behavior of two-stage RLHF for a
parametric class and relate it to a natural gradient step in policy space. Our
fine-grained geometric characterization allows us to propose AuxDPO, which
introduces additional auxiliary variables in the DPO loss function to help move
towards the RLHF solution in a principled manner and mitigate the
misspecification in DPO. We empirically demonstrate the superior performance of
AuxDPO on didactic bandit settings as well as LLM alignment tasks.

Conclusion: 所提出的解决方案通过处理标记不平衡问题，显著提升了稀有标记事件的预测性能，代码已开源。

Abstract: Marked Temporal Point Process (MTPP) has been well studied to model the event
distribution in marked event streams, which can be used to predict the mark and
arrival time of the next event. However, existing studies overlook that the
distribution of event marks is highly imbalanced in many real-world
applications, with some marks being frequent but others rare. The imbalance
poses a significant challenge to the performance of the next event prediction,
especially for events of rare marks. To address this issue, we propose a
thresholding method, which learns thresholds to tune the mark probability
normalized by the mark's prior probability to optimize mark prediction, rather
than predicting the mark directly based on the mark probability as in existing
studies. In conjunction with this method, we predict the mark first and then
the time. In particular, we develop a novel neural MTPP model to support
effective time sampling and estimation of mark probability without
computationally expensive numerical improper integration. Extensive experiments
on real-world datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our solution
against various baselines for the next event mark and time prediction. The code
is available at https://github.com/undes1red/IFNMTPP.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly deployed in real-world systems,
yet they can produce toxic or biased outputs that undermine safety and trust.
Post-hoc model repair provides a practical remedy, but the high cost of
parameter updates motivates selective use of repair data. Despite extensive
prior work on data selection for model training, it remains unclear which
sampling criteria are most effective and efficient when applied specifically to
behavioral repair of large generative models. Our study presents a systematic
analysis of sample prioritization strategies for LLM repair. We evaluate five
representative selection methods, including random sampling, K-Center,
gradient-norm-based selection(GraNd), stratified coverage (CCS), and a
Semantic-Aware Prioritized Sampling (SAPS) approach we proposed. Repair
effectiveness and trade-offs are assessed through toxicity reduction,
perplexity on WikiText-2 and LAMBADA, and three composite metrics: the Repair
Proximity Score (RPS), the Overall Performance Score (OPS), and the Repair
Efficiency Score (RES). Experimental results show that SAPS achieves the best
balance between detoxification, utility preservation, and efficiency,
delivering comparable or superior repair outcomes with substantially less data.
Random sampling remains effective for large or robust models, while
high-overhead methods such as CCS and GraNd provide limited benefit. The
optimal data proportion depends on model scale and repair method, indicating
that sample selection should be regarded as a tunable component of repair
pipelines. Overall, these findings establish selection-based repair as an
efficient and scalable paradigm for maintaining LLM reliability.

Abstract: Evaluating competing systems in a comparable way, i.e., benchmarking them, is
an undeniable pillar of the scientific method. However, system performance is
often summarized via a small number of metrics. The analysis of the evaluation
details and the derivation of insights for further development or use remains a
tedious manual task with often biased results. Thus, this paper argues for a
new type of benchmarking, which is dubbed explainable benchmarking. The aim of
explainable benchmarking approaches is to automatically generate explanations
for the performance of systems in a benchmark. We provide a first instantiation
of this paradigm for knowledge-graph-based question answering systems. We
compute explanations by using a novel concept learning approach developed for
large knowledge graphs called PruneCEL. Our evaluation shows that PruneCEL
outperforms state-of-the-art concept learners on the task of explainable
benchmarking by up to 0.55 points F1 measure. A task-driven user study with 41
participants shows that in 80\% of the cases, the majority of participants can
accurately predict the behavior of a system based on our explanations. Our code

Abstract: Drug combinations offer therapeutic benefits but also carry the risk of
adverse drug-drug interactions (DDIs), especially under complex molecular
structures. Accurate DDI event prediction requires capturing fine-grained
inter-drug relationships, which are critical for modeling metabolic mechanisms
such as enzyme-mediated competition. However, existing approaches typically
rely on isolated drug representations and fail to explicitly model atom-level
cross-molecular interactions, limiting their effectiveness across diverse
molecular complexities and DDI type distributions. To address these
limitations, we propose MolBridge, a novel atom-level joint graph refinement
framework for robust DDI event prediction. MolBridge constructs a joint graph
that integrates atomic structures of drug pairs, enabling direct modeling of
inter-drug associations. A central challenge in such joint graph settings is
the potential loss of information caused by over-smoothing when modeling
long-range atomic dependencies. To overcome this, we introduce a structure
consistency module that iteratively refines node features while preserving the
global structural context. This joint design allows MolBridge to effectively
learn both local and global interaction outperforms state-of-the-art baselines,
achieving superior performance across long-tail and inductive scenarios.
patterns, yielding robust representations across both frequent and rare DDI
types. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets show that MolBridge
consistently. These results demonstrate the advantages of fine-grained graph
refinement in improving the accuracy, robustness, and mechanistic
interpretability of DDI event prediction.This work contributes to Web Mining
and Content Analysis by developing graph-based methods for mining and analyzing
drug-drug interaction networks.

*Lawrence Clegg,John Cartlidge*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于图神经网络的网球比赛预测方法，通过构建时间有向图来显式建模选手间的不可传递关系（A胜B、B胜C但C胜A），发现在高不可传递性比赛中博彩公司处理不佳，利用该模型进行选择性投注可获得3.26%的正回报。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 网球比赛中普遍存在不可传递的选手支配关系，但现有预测方法很少尝试将其纳入考虑。博彩公司Pinnacle Sports在处理高不可传递复杂度的比赛时表现不佳，存在市场效率不足。

Method: 使用图神经网络方法，构建时间有向图（选手为节点，历史比赛结果为有向边），显式建模不可传递关系。

Result: 模型在高不可传递性比赛中达到65.7%的准确率和0.215的Brier分数，使用Kelly投注策略在1903次投注中获得3.26%的正回报率。

Conclusion: 图神经网络方法能够有效捕捉不可传递关系中的动态关系，成功利用了博彩市场在处理不可传递比赛时的效率不足，实现了显著的正收益。

Abstract: Intransitive player dominance, where player A beats B, B beats C, but C beats
A, is common in competitive tennis. Yet, there are few known attempts to
incorporate it within forecasting methods. We address this problem with a graph
neural network approach that explicitly models these intransitive relationships
through temporal directed graphs, with players as nodes and their historical
match outcomes as directed edges. We find the bookmaker Pinnacle Sports poorly
handles matches with high intransitive complexity and posit that our
graph-based approach is uniquely positioned to capture relational dynamics in
these scenarios. When selectively betting on higher intransitivity matchups
with our model (65.7% accuracy, 0.215 Brier Score), we achieve significant
positive returns of 3.26% ROI with Kelly staking over 1903 bets, suggesting a
market inefficiency in handling intransitive matchups that our approach
successfully exploits.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种针对后处理图像水印的伪造攻击方法，通过训练偏好模型来检测水印，并利用反向传播优化实现水印的移除和伪造，无需了解水印模型细节。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>

Method: 1. 引入偏好模型评估图像是否含水印，使用排序损失在纯程序生成图像上训练，无需真实水印数据；2. 通过反向传播优化输入图像实现水印移除和伪造，仅需单张水印图像且无需水印模型知识。

Result: 在多种后处理图像水印模型上的评估表明，该方法能有效伪造水印，对当前水印方法的安全性提出了质疑。

Conclusion: 该方法简单实用，仅需单张水印图像即可实现水印伪造，揭示了当前水印方法的安全漏洞。

Abstract: Recent years have seen a surge in interest in digital content watermarking
techniques, driven by the proliferation of generative models and increased
legal pressure. With an ever-growing percentage of AI-generated content
available online, watermarking plays an increasingly important role in ensuring
content authenticity and attribution at scale. There have been many works
assessing the robustness of watermarking to removal attacks, yet, watermark
forging, the scenario when a watermark is stolen from genuine content and
applied to malicious content, remains underexplored. In this work, we
investigate watermark forging in the context of widely used post-hoc image
watermarking. Our contributions are as follows. First, we introduce a
preference model to assess whether an image is watermarked. The model is
trained using a ranking loss on purely procedurally generated images without
any need for real watermarks. Second, we demonstrate the model's capability to
remove and forge watermarks by optimizing the input image through
backpropagation. This technique requires only a single watermarked image and
works without knowledge of the watermarking model, making our attack much
simpler and more practical than attacks introduced in related work. Third, we
evaluate our proposed method on a variety of post-hoc image watermarking
models, demonstrating that our approach can effectively forge watermarks,
questioning the security of current watermarking approaches. Our code and
further resources are publicly available.

Motivation: 现有半监督微调方法依赖预测一致性或预定义置信度阈值，容易导致模型偏差和超参数敏感性问题。

Method: Bi-CoG方法同时利用模型间和模型内一致性，采用错误感知动态伪标签分配策略来分配高质量、低偏差的伪标签。

Result: 在14个数据集上的广泛实验表明，Bi-CoG能持续显著提升现有方法的性能。

Conclusion: Bi-CoG是一种简单有效的即插即用方法，通过双一致性引导的自训练机制有效解决了半监督微调中的关键问题。

Abstract: Exploiting unlabeled data through semi-supervised learning (SSL) or
leveraging pre-trained models via fine-tuning are two prevailing paradigms for
addressing label-scarce scenarios. Recently, growing attention has been given
to combining fine-tuning of pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) with SSL,
forming the emerging paradigm of semi-supervised fine-tuning. However, existing
methods often suffer from model bias and hyperparameter sensitivity, due to
reliance on prediction consistency or pre-defined confidence thresholds. To
address these limitations, we propose a simple yet effective plug-and-play
methodology named
$\underline{\textbf{Bi-Co}}$nsistency-$\underline{\textbf{G}}$uided
Self-Training (Bi-CoG), which assigns high-quality and low-bias pseudo-labels,
by simultaneously exploiting inter-model and intra-model consistency, along
with an error-aware dynamic pseudo-label assignment strategy. Both theoretical
analysis and extensive experiments over 14 datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of Bi-CoG, which consistently and significantly improves the
performance of existing methods.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出Hurdle-IMDL框架解决遥感降雨反演中的标签不平衡问题，通过分解零膨胀和长尾分布，有效改善强降雨的检索性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 人工智能在定量遥感中的应用受到标签分布不平衡的限制，传统训练模型偏向常见样本，导致罕见样本（如强降雨）的检索性能下降。

Method: 采用分而治之策略，将降雨分布不平衡分解为零膨胀（非降雨样本占主导）和长尾（轻降雨样本相对于强降雨样本比例失调）。使用hurdle模型处理零膨胀，提出IMDL方法通过将学习目标转化为无偏理想逆模型来处理长尾问题。

Result: 通过统计指标和案例研究验证，Hurdle-IMDL在华东地区降雨天气中优于传统方法、成本敏感方法、生成方法和多任务学习方法，显著减轻系统低估，大幅改善强到极端降雨的检索性能。

Conclusion: IMDL为处理环境变量分布不平衡提供了通用方法，能够增强对罕见但高影响事件的检索能力。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence has advanced quantitative remote sensing, yet its
effectiveness is constrained by imbalanced label distribution. This imbalance
leads conventionally trained models to favor common samples, which in turn
degrades retrieval performance for rare ones. Rainfall retrieval exemplifies
this issue, with performance particularly compromised for heavy rain. This
study proposes Hurdle-Inversion Model Debiasing Learning (IMDL) framework.
Following a divide-and-conquer strategy, imbalance in the rain distribution is
decomposed into two components: zero inflation, defined by the predominance of
non-rain samples; and long tail, defined by the disproportionate abundance of
light-rain samples relative to heavy-rain samples. A hurdle model is adopted to
handle the zero inflation, while IMDL is proposed to address the long tail by
transforming the learning object into an unbiased ideal inverse model.
Comprehensive evaluation via statistical metrics and case studies investigating
rainy weather in eastern China confirms Hurdle-IMDL's superiority over
conventional, cost-sensitive, generative, and multi-task learning methods. Its
key advancements include effective mitigation of systematic underestimation and
a marked improvement in the retrieval of heavy-to-extreme rain. IMDL offers a
generalizable approach for addressing imbalance in distributions of
environmental variables, enabling enhanced retrieval of rare yet high-impact
events.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统多模态对齐方法假设所有模态间存在相互冗余，这在现实分布式场景中不成立。需要一种不依赖此假设的去中心化对齐方法。

Method: 使用层结构建模模态间关系，采用去中心化对比学习目标进行训练，在多比较空间中进行对齐。

Result: 在多模态感知数据集上表现出优越的零样本泛化能力、跨模态对齐效果和缺失模态鲁棒性，通信成本比现有方法低50%。

Conclusion: SheafAlign通过层理论框架成功解决了传统多模态对齐方法的局限性，在保持性能的同时显著降低了通信成本。

Abstract: Conventional multimodal alignment methods assume mutual redundancy across all
modalities, an assumption that fails in real-world distributed scenarios. We
propose SheafAlign, a sheaf-theoretic framework for decentralized multimodal
alignment that replaces single-space alignment with multiple comparison spaces.
This approach models pairwise modality relations through sheaf structures and
leverages decentralized contrastive learning-based objectives for training.
SheafAlign overcomes the limitations of prior methods by not requiring mutual
redundancy among all modalities, preserving both shared and unique information.
Experiments on multimodal sensing datasets show superior zero-shot
generalization, cross-modal alignment, and robustness to missing modalities,
with 50\% lower communication cost than state-of-the-art baselines.

Abstract: Zero-shot reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a setting for developing
general agents in an unsupervised manner, capable of solving downstream tasks
without additional training or planning at test-time. Unlike conventional RL,
which optimizes policies for a fixed reward, zero-shot RL requires agents to
encode representations rich enough to support immediate adaptation to any
objective, drawing parallels to vision and language foundation models. Despite
growing interest, the field lacks a common analytical lens.
  We present the first unified framework for zero-shot RL. Our formulation
introduces a consistent notation and taxonomy that organizes existing
approaches and allows direct comparison between them. Central to our framework
is the classification of algorithms into two families: direct representations,
which learn end-to-end mappings from rewards to policies, and compositional
representations, which decompose the representation leveraging the substructure
of the value function. Within this framework, we highlight shared principles
and key differences across methods, and we derive an extended bound for
successor-feature methods, offering a new perspective on their performance in
the zero-shot regime. By consolidating existing work under a common lens, our
framework provides a principled foundation for future research in zero-shot RL
and outlines a clear path toward developing more general agents.

Motivation: 图重布线技术虽然能缓解图神经网络中的过度挤压问题，但会改变图拓扑结构，可能扭曲重要的拓扑依赖信号。目前尚不清楚需要保留哪些结构特性才能确保性能提升和结构保真度。

Method: 研究了七种不同的重布线策略，并关联了局部和全局图属性变化与节点分类准确性的关系。

Result: 结果显示一致的模式：成功的重布线方法倾向于保留局部结构，同时允许全局连接性的灵活性。

Conclusion: 这些发现为设计有效的重布线策略提供了新见解，弥合了图理论与实际GNN优化之间的差距。

Abstract: Graph rewiring has emerged as a key technique to alleviate over-squashing in
Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) and Graph Transformers by modifying the graph
topology to improve information flow. While effective, rewiring inherently
alters the graph's structure, raising the risk of distorting important
topology-dependent signals. Yet, despite the growing use of rewiring, little is
known about which structural properties must be preserved to ensure both
performance gains and structural fidelity. In this work, we provide the first
systematic analysis of how rewiring affects a range of graph structural
metrics, and how these changes relate to downstream task performance. We study
seven diverse rewiring strategies and correlate changes in local and global
graph properties with node classification accuracy. Our results reveal a
consistent pattern: successful rewiring methods tend to preserve local
structure while allowing for flexibility in global connectivity. These findings
offer new insights into the design of effective rewiring strategies, bridging
the gap between graph theory and practical GNN optimization.

systems presents significant challenges. This pa- per analyzes the fundamental
obstacles in combining MLOps with OT en- vironments and proposes a systematic

MLOps integration and present a detailed mapping of MLOps lifecycle compo-

demonstrate that while standard MLOps practices cannot be directly transplanted
to OT environments, structured adaptation using existing reference models can
provide a pathway for successful integration.

Result: 在多种推理问题上超越了现有最先进方法，能够泛化到更大更复杂的问题。

Conclusion: 通过组合子问题能量函数构建全局能量景观的方法有效提升了推理模型的泛化能力，为解决复杂推理问题提供了新思路。

Abstract: Generalization is a key challenge in machine learning, specifically in
reasoning tasks, where models are expected to solve problems more complex than
those encountered during training. Existing approaches typically train
reasoning models in an end-to-end fashion, directly mapping input instances to
solutions. While this allows models to learn useful heuristics from data, it
often results in limited generalization beyond the training distribution. In
this work, we propose a novel approach to reasoning generalization by learning
energy landscapes over the solution spaces of smaller, more tractable
subproblems. At test time, we construct a global energy landscape for a given
problem by combining the energy functions of multiple subproblems. This
compositional approach enables the incorporation of additional constraints
during inference, allowing the construction of energy landscapes for problems
of increasing difficulty. To improve the sample quality from this newly
constructed energy landscape, we introduce Parallel Energy Minimization (PEM).
We evaluate our approach on a wide set of reasoning problems. Our method
outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods, demonstrating its ability to
generalize to larger and more complex problems. Project website can be found

Motivation: 经典SGD分析依赖于过强(有界方差)或过粗糙(均匀噪声)的假设，期望平滑性条件作为灵活替代方案，将随机梯度的二阶矩与目标函数值和全梯度联系起来。

Method: 通过精炼ES条件及其解释，引入采样依赖常数，推导全梯度范数平方的期望界，分析不同步长策略下的收敛行为。

Result: 证明了SGD在ES条件下具有O(1/K)的收敛速率，并给出了显式的残差误差表达式，统一并扩展了近期相关研究。

Conclusion: 该分析为SGD在更一般条件下的收敛性提供了自包含的理论框架，所有证明细节在附录中完整给出。

Abstract: Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is the workhorse of large-scale learning,
yet classical analyses rely on assumptions that can be either too strong
(bounded variance) or too coarse (uniform noise). The expected smoothness (ES)
condition has emerged as a flexible alternative that ties the second moment of
stochastic gradients to the objective value and the full gradient. This paper
presents a self-contained convergence analysis of SGD under ES. We (i) refine
ES with interpretations and sampling-dependent constants; (ii) derive bounds of
the expectation of squared full gradient norm; and (iii) prove $O(1/K)$ rates
with explicit residual errors for various step-size schedules. All proofs are
given in full detail in the appendix. Our treatment unifies and extends recent
threads (Khaled and Richt\'arik, 2020; Umeda and Iiduka, 2025).

Abstract: Breast cancer is considered the most critical and frequently diagnosed cancer
in women worldwide, leading to an increase in cancer-related mortality. Early
and accurate detection is crucial as it can help mitigate possible threats
while improving survival rates. In terms of prediction, conventional diagnostic
methods are often limited by variability, cost, and, most importantly, risk of
misdiagnosis. To address these challenges, machine learning (ML) has emerged as
a powerful tool for computer-aided diagnosis, with feature selection playing a
vital role in improving model performance and interpretability. This research
study proposes an integrated framework that incorporates customized Particle
Swarm Optimization (PSO) for feature selection. This framework has been
evaluated on a comprehensive set of 29 different models, spanning classical
classifiers, ensemble techniques, neural networks, probabilistic algorithms,
and instance-based algorithms. To ensure interpretability and clinical
relevance, the study uses cross-validation in conjunction with explainable AI
methods. Experimental evaluation showed that the proposed approach achieved a
superior score of 99.1\% across all performance metrics, including accuracy and
precision, while effectively reducing dimensionality and providing transparent,
model-agnostic explanations. The results highlight the potential of combining
swarm intelligence with explainable ML for robust, trustworthy, and clinically
meaningful breast cancer diagnosis.

Abstract: Mass spectrometry (MS) plays a critical role in molecular identification,
significantly advancing scientific discovery. However, structure elucidation
from MS data remains challenging due to the scarcity of annotated spectra.
While large-scale pretraining has proven effective in addressing data scarcity
in other domains, applying this paradigm to mass spectrometry is hindered by
the complexity and heterogeneity of raw spectral signals. To address this, we
propose MS-BART, a unified modeling framework that maps mass spectra and
molecular structures into a shared token vocabulary, enabling cross-modal
learning through large-scale pretraining on reliably computed
fingerprint-molecule datasets. Multi-task pretraining objectives further
enhance MS-BART's generalization by jointly optimizing denoising and
translation task. The pretrained model is subsequently transferred to
experimental spectra through finetuning on fingerprint predictions generated
with MIST, a pre-trained spectral inference model, thereby enhancing robustness
to real-world spectral variability. While finetuning alleviates the
distributional difference, MS-BART still suffers molecular hallucination and
requires further alignment. We therefore introduce a chemical feedback
mechanism that guides the model toward generating molecules closer to the
reference structure. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that MS-BART achieves
SOTA performance across 5/12 key metrics on MassSpecGym and NPLIB1 and is
faster by one order of magnitude than competing diffusion-based methods, while
comprehensive ablation studies systematically validate the model's
effectiveness and robustness.

TL;DR: 本文分析了差分隐私迁移学习中的两个关键超参数：裁剪边界C和批量大小B。研究发现理论选择与实证结果存在不匹配，现有启发式方法对B的调优无效，且跨任务使用单一(C,B)设置会导致性能下降。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前差分隐私迁移学习实践中，理论指导与实证结果存在矛盾：理论上更强的隐私需要更小的C，但实证中在强隐私下更大的C表现更好。同时，现有方法对批量大小B的调优启发式方法无效。

Method: 通过分析梯度分布变化，研究裁剪边界C对性能的影响；在有限计算预算下，检验批量大小B的调优方法；分析跨任务使用单一(C,B)设置的性能影响。

Result: 发现梯度分布变化导致理论与实证不匹配；累积DP噪声能更好解释批量大小选择；跨任务使用单一(C,B)设置，特别是在隐私强度变化和计算资源差异时，会导致显著性能下降。

Conclusion: 需要重新考虑差分隐私迁移学习中的超参数选择策略，特别是裁剪边界C和批量大小B的设置，应考虑任务特定性和隐私-计算约束的变化。

Abstract: Differentially private (DP) transfer learning, i.e., fine-tuning a pretrained
model on private data, is the current state-of-the-art approach for training
large models under privacy constraints. We focus on two key hyperparameters in
this setting: the clipping bound $C$ and batch size $B$. We show a clear
mismatch between the current theoretical understanding of how to choose an
optimal $C$ (stronger privacy requires smaller $C$) and empirical outcomes
(larger $C$ performs better under strong privacy), caused by changes in the
gradient distributions. Assuming a limited compute budget (fixed epochs), we
demonstrate that the existing heuristics for tuning $B$ do not work, while
cumulative DP noise better explains whether smaller or larger batches perform
better. We also highlight how the common practice of using a single $(C,B)$
setting across tasks can lead to suboptimal performance. We find that
performance drops especially when moving between loose and tight privacy and
between plentiful and limited compute, which we explain by analyzing clipping
as a form of gradient re-weighting and examining cumulative DP noise.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 机器学习模型在医疗保健中的应用可能放大临床数据中的结构性不平等和社会偏见，特别是在生存分析中，删失和时间动态使公平模型开发更加复杂。现有公平性方法常忽视跨组排名差异，可能导致高风险黑人患者被排在低风险白人患者之后，强化生物本质主义并损害公平护理。

Method: 提出FASM方法，专门设计用于缓解算法偏见，关注组内和跨组风险排序的时间动态。使用乳腺癌预后作为代表性案例，应用于SEER乳腺癌数据。

Conclusion: 该方法能够开发既重视准确性又关注公平性的生存模型，将公平性作为临床护理的核心原则推进。

Abstract: As machine learning models become increasingly integrated into healthcare,
structural inequities and social biases embedded in clinical data can be
perpetuated or even amplified by data-driven models. In survival analysis,
censoring and time dynamics can further add complexity to fair model
development. Additionally, algorithmic fairness approaches often overlook
disparities in cross-group rankings, e.g., high-risk Black patients may be
ranked below lower-risk White patients who do not experience the event of
mortality. Such misranking can reinforce biological essentialism and undermine
equitable care. We propose a Fairness-Aware Survival Modeling (FASM), designed
to mitigate algorithmic bias regarding both intra-group and cross-group risk
rankings over time. Using breast cancer prognosis as a representative case and
applying FASM to SEER breast cancer data, we show that FASM substantially
improves fairness while preserving discrimination performance comparable to
fairness-unaware survival models. Time-stratified evaluations show that FASM
maintains stable fairness over a 10-year horizon, with the greatest
improvements observed during the mid-term of follow-up. Our approach enables
the development of survival models that prioritize both accuracy and equity in
clinical decision-making, advancing fairness as a core principle in clinical
care.

TL;DR: H-SPLID是一种新颖算法，通过将显著和非显著特征显式分解到不同空间来学习显著特征表示，提升模型鲁棒性并促进低维任务相关特征学习。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法在特征学习时往往没有明确区分显著和非显著特征，这可能导致模型学习到冗余或不相关的特征，影响模型的鲁棒性和泛化能力。

Method: 提出H-SPLID算法，将输入特征显式分解为显著和非显著两个子空间，利用Hilbert-Schmidt独立性准则(HSIC)建立输入与表示之间的关联，并通过理论分析证明预测偏差与显著子空间维度的关系。

Result: 在图像分类任务上的实验表明，使用H-SPLID训练的模型主要依赖显著输入成分，对影响非显著特征（如图像背景）的扰动表现出更低的敏感性。

Conclusion: H-SPLID成功建立了鲁棒性与潜在表示压缩之间的联系，通过维度压缩和信息保留实现了更鲁棒的特征学习，为提升模型对抗扰动的能力提供了有效方法。

Abstract: We introduce H-SPLID, a novel algorithm for learning salient feature
representations through the explicit decomposition of salient and non-salient
features into separate spaces. We show that H-SPLID promotes learning
low-dimensional, task-relevant features. We prove that the expected prediction
deviation under input perturbations is upper-bounded by the dimension of the
salient subspace and the Hilbert-Schmidt Independence Criterion (HSIC) between
inputs and representations. This establishes a link between robustness and
latent representation compression in terms of the dimensionality and
information preserved. Empirical evaluations on image classification tasks show
that models trained with H-SPLID primarily rely on salient input components, as
indicated by reduced sensitivity to perturbations affecting non-salient
features, such as image backgrounds. Our code is available at

Conclusion: GRACE框架能有效解决成瘾数据集中的类别不平衡问题，提升护理场所预测性能

Abstract: Determining the appropriate locus of care for addiction patients is one of
the most critical clinical decisions that affects patient treatment outcomes
and effective use of resources. With a lack of sufficient specialized treatment
resources, such as inpatient beds or staff, there is an unmet need to develop
an automated framework for the same. Current decision-making approaches suffer
from severe class imbalances in addiction datasets. To address this limitation,
we propose a novel graph neural network (GRACE) framework that formalizes locus
of care prediction as a structured learning problem. Further, we perform
extensive feature engineering and propose a new approach of obtaining an
unbiased meta-graph to train a GNN to overcome the class imbalance problem.
Experimental results in real-world data show an improvement of 11-35% in terms
of the F1 score of the minority class over competitive baselines. The codes and
note embeddings are available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/GRACE-F8E1/.

Result: 实验结果表明，提出的LLM/LMM辅助自主系统显著优于传统和判别性深度学习模型，在动态目标、变化输入参数和异构多模态条件下保持鲁棒性。

Conclusion: LLM/LMM在6G自主通信中具有巨大潜力，能够克服传统静态优化在动态环境中的性能退化问题。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) and large multimodal models (LMMs) have achieved
unprecedented breakthrough, showcasing remarkable capabilities in natural
language understanding, generation, and complex reasoning. This transformative
potential has positioned them as key enablers for 6G autonomous communications
among machines, vehicles, and humanoids. In this article, we provide an
overview of task-oriented autonomous communications with LLMs/LMMs, focusing on
multimodal sensing integration, adaptive reconfiguration, and
prompt/fine-tuning strategies for wireless tasks. We demonstrate the framework
through three case studies: LMM-based traffic control, LLM-based robot
scheduling, and LMM-based environment-aware channel estimation. From
experimental results, we show that the proposed LLM/LMM-aided autonomous
systems significantly outperform conventional and discriminative deep learning
(DL) model-based techniques, maintaining robustness under dynamic objectives,
varying input parameters, and heterogeneous multimodal conditions where
conventional static optimization degrades.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于学习的神经解码方法存在两难：简单的因果模型缺乏泛化能力，复杂的非因果模型虽然泛化好但难以实时应用，且都依赖高能耗的人工神经网络，难以集成到资源受限的现实系统中。

Method: 提出Spikachu框架，直接处理分箱的脉冲信号，将其投影到共享潜在空间，通过适应输入时序的脉冲模块提取相关特征，然后整合这些潜在表示并解码生成行为预测。

Result: 在6只非人灵长类动物的113个记录会话（总计43小时）上评估，该方法在单会话训练中优于因果基线，能耗降低2.26-418.81倍；多会话和跨被试训练能进一步提升性能并实现少样本迁移。

Conclusion: Spikachu提供了一个基于SNN的可扩展、在线兼容的神经解码框架，性能与最先进模型相当，同时能耗降低数个数量级。

Abstract: Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) promise to enable vital functions, such as
speech and prosthetic control, for individuals with neuromotor impairments.
Central to their success are neural decoders, models that map neural activity
to intended behavior. Current learning-based decoding approaches fall into two
classes: simple, causal models that lack generalization, or complex, non-causal
models that generalize and scale offline but struggle in real-time settings.
Both face a common challenge, their reliance on power-hungry artificial neural
network backbones, which makes integration into real-world, resource-limited
systems difficult. Spiking neural networks (SNNs) offer a promising
alternative. Because they operate causally these models are suitable for
real-time use, and their low energy demands make them ideal for
battery-constrained environments. To this end, we introduce Spikachu: a
scalable, causal, and energy-efficient neural decoding framework based on SNNs.
Our approach processes binned spikes directly by projecting them into a shared
latent space, where spiking modules, adapted to the timing of the input,
extract relevant features; these latent representations are then integrated and
decoded to generate behavioral predictions. We evaluate our approach on 113
recording sessions from 6 non-human primates, totaling 43 hours of recordings.
Our method outperforms causal baselines when trained on single sessions using
between 2.26 and 418.81 times less energy. Furthermore, we demonstrate that
scaling up training to multiple sessions and subjects improves performance and
enables few-shot transfer to unseen sessions, subjects, and tasks. Overall,
Spikachu introduces a scalable, online-compatible neural decoding framework
based on SNNs, whose performance is competitive relative to state-of-the-art
models while consuming orders of magnitude less energy.

Conclusion: DiRecGNN框架在云服务监控维度推荐任务中表现出色，能够有效捕捉复杂依赖关系，获得了用户的高度认可。

Abstract: In this paper, we present DiRecGNN, an attention-enhanced entity
recommendation framework for monitoring cloud services at Microsoft. We provide
insights on the usefulness of this feature as perceived by the cloud service
owners and lessons learned from deployment. Specifically, we introduce the
problem of recommending the optimal subset of attributes (dimensions) that
should be tracked by an automated watchdog (monitor) for cloud services. To
begin, we construct the monitor heterogeneous graph at production-scale. The
interaction dynamics of these entities are often characterized by limited
structural and engagement information, resulting in inferior performance of
state-of-the-art approaches. Moreover, traditional methods fail to capture the
dependencies between entities spanning a long range due to their homophilic
nature. Therefore, we propose an attention-enhanced entity ranking model
inspired by transformer architectures. Our model utilizes a multi-head
attention mechanism to focus on heterogeneous neighbors and their attributes,
and further attends to paths sampled using random walks to capture long-range
dependencies. We also employ multi-faceted loss functions to optimize for
relevant recommendations while respecting the inherent sparsity of the data.
Empirical evaluations demonstrate significant improvements over existing
methods, with our model achieving a 43.1% increase in MRR. Furthermore, product
teams who consumed these features perceive the feature as useful and rated it
4.5 out of 5.

Result: 两种模型在20个时间点内表现出强大的预测性能，在50个时间点内保持稳定的异常预测。GNN在性能上持续优于N-BEATS模型，且需要更少的可训练参数和更低的计算成本。

Conclusion: GNN作为有前景的在线异常预测解决方案，适合在制造环境中部署，能够有效处理半导体制造中的复杂依赖关系和预测挑战。

Abstract: Semiconductor manufacturing is an extremely complex and precision-driven
process, characterized by thousands of interdependent parameters collected
across diverse tools and process steps. Multi-variate time-series analysis has
emerged as a critical field for real-time monitoring and fault detection in
such environments. However, anomaly prediction in semiconductor fabrication
presents several critical challenges, including high dimensionality of sensor
data and severe class imbalance due to the rarity of true faults. Furthermore,
the complex interdependencies between variables complicate both anomaly
prediction and root-cause-analysis. This paper proposes two novel approaches to
advance the field from anomaly detection to anomaly prediction, an essential
step toward enabling real-time process correction and proactive fault
prevention. The proposed anomaly prediction framework contains two main stages:
(a) training a forecasting model on a dataset assumed to contain no anomalies,
and (b) performing forecast on unseen time series data. The forecast is
compared with the forecast of the trained signal. Deviations beyond a
predefined threshold are flagged as anomalies. The two approaches differ in the
forecasting model employed. The first assumes independence between variables by
utilizing the N-BEATS model for univariate time series forecasting. The second
lifts this assumption by utilizing a Graph Neural Network (GNN) to capture
inter-variable relationships. Both models demonstrate strong forecasting
performance up to a horizon of 20 time points and maintain stable anomaly
prediction up to 50 time points. The GNN consistently outperforms the N-BEATS
model while requiring significantly fewer trainable parameters and lower
computational cost. These results position the GNN as promising solution for
online anomaly forecasting to be deployed in manufacturing environments.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一个新的、紧致的、可处理的KLD下界作为JSD的函数，证明了最大化基于JSD的信息能增加互信息的保证下界，为基于互信息的表示学习提供了新的理论依据。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然互信息是表示学习中的基本统计依赖度量，但直接优化通常难以处理。许多方法转而最大化替代依赖度量（如JSD），但这些替代目标与互信息的关系仍不清楚。

Method: 推导了KLD作为JSD函数的新紧致下界，并将其特化到联合和边缘分布。通过训练二元分类器最小化交叉熵损失来实际实现JSD目标。

Result: 实验表明该下界在MI估计中很紧致，相比最先进的神经估计器，能提供稳定、低方差的紧致下界估计，并在信息瓶颈框架中具有实用价值。

Conclusion: 研究结果为在基于互信息的表示学习中使用判别式学习提供了新的理论依据和强有力的经验证据。

Abstract: Mutual Information (MI) is a fundamental measure of statistical dependence
widely used in representation learning. While direct optimization of MI via its
definition as a Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLD) is often intractable, many
recent methods have instead maximized alternative dependence measures, most
notably, the Jensen-Shannon divergence (JSD) between joint and product of
marginal distributions via discriminative losses. However, the connection
between these surrogate objectives and MI remains poorly understood. In this
work, we bridge this gap by deriving a new, tight, and tractable lower bound on
KLD as a function of JSD in the general case. By specializing this bound to
joint and marginal distributions, we demonstrate that maximizing the JSD-based
information increases a guaranteed lower bound on mutual information.
Furthermore, we revisit the practical implementation of JSD-based objectives
and observe that minimizing the cross-entropy loss of a binary classifier
trained to distinguish joint from marginal pairs recovers a known variational
lower bound on the JSD. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our lower bound
is tight when applied to MI estimation. We compared our lower bound to
state-of-the-art neural estimators of variational lower bound across a range of
established reference scenarios. Our lower bound estimator consistently
provides a stable, low-variance estimate of a tight lower bound on MI. We also
demonstrate its practical usefulness in the context of the Information
Bottleneck framework. Taken together, our results provide new theoretical
justifications and strong empirical evidence for using discriminative learning
in MI-based representation learning.

Abstract: Natural language has long enabled human cooperation, but its lossy,
ambiguous, and indirect nature limits the potential of collective intelligence.
While machines are not subject to these constraints, most LLM-based multi-agent
systems still rely solely on natural language, exchanging tokens or their
embeddings. To go beyond language, we introduce a new paradigm, thought
communication, which enables agents to interact directly mind-to-mind, akin to
telepathy. To uncover these latent thoughts in a principled way, we formalize
the process as a general latent variable model, where agent states are
generated by an unknown function of underlying thoughts. We prove that, in a
nonparametric setting without auxiliary information, both shared and private
latent thoughts between any pair of agents can be identified. Moreover, the
global structure of thought sharing, including which agents share which
thoughts and how these relationships are structured, can also be recovered with
theoretical guarantees. Guided by the established theory, we develop a
framework that extracts latent thoughts from all agents prior to communication
and assigns each agent the relevant thoughts, along with their sharing
patterns. This paradigm naturally extends beyond LLMs to all modalities, as
most observational data arise from hidden generative processes. Experiments on
both synthetic and real-world benchmarks validate the theory and demonstrate
the collaborative advantages of thought communication. We hope this work
illuminates the potential of leveraging the hidden world, as many challenges
remain unsolvable through surface-level observation alone, regardless of
compute or data scale.

Result: 在多个数据集上的实验显示，xTime在极端事件上的预测准确率从3%提升到78%

Conclusion: xTime框架通过知识蒸馏和专家混合机制有效解决了极端事件预测中的数据不平衡问题，显著提升了预测性能

Abstract: Extreme events frequently occur in real-world time series and often carry
significant practical implications. In domains such as climate and healthcare,
these events, such as floods, heatwaves, or acute medical episodes, can lead to
serious consequences. Accurate forecasting of such events is therefore of
substantial importance. Most existing time series forecasting models are
optimized for overall performance within the prediction window, but often
struggle to accurately predict extreme events, such as high temperatures or
heart rate spikes. The main challenges are data imbalance and the neglect of
valuable information contained in intermediate events that precede extreme
events. In this paper, we propose xTime, a novel framework for extreme event
forecasting in time series. xTime leverages knowledge distillation to transfer
information from models trained on lower-rarity events, thereby improving
prediction performance on rarer ones. In addition, we introduce a mixture of
experts (MoE) mechanism that dynamically selects and fuses outputs from expert
models across different rarity levels, which further improves the forecasting
performance for extreme events. Experiments on multiple datasets show that
xTime achieves consistent improvements, with forecasting accuracy on extreme
events improving from 3% to 78%.

Conclusion: 结合梯度指导、选择性矩阵降维和小样本评估，实现了快速、无需微调的LLM下游任务适配算法。

Abstract: Recently, Sharma et al. suggested a method called Layer-SElective-Rank
reduction (LASER) which demonstrated that pruning high-order components of
carefully chosen LLM's weight matrices can boost downstream accuracy -- without
any gradient-based fine-tuning. Yet LASER's exhaustive, per-matrix search (each
requiring full-dataset forward passes) makes it impractical for rapid
deployment. We demonstrate that this overhead can be removed and find that: (i)
Only a small, carefully chosen subset of matrices needs to be inspected --
eliminating the layer-by-layer sweep, (ii) The gradient of each matrix's
singular values pinpoints which matrices merit reduction, (iii) Increasing the
factorization search space by allowing matrices rows to cluster around multiple
subspaces and then decomposing each cluster separately further reduces
overfitting on the original training data and further lifts accuracy by up to
24.6 percentage points, and finally, (iv) we discover that evaluating on just
100 samples rather than the full training data -- both for computing the
indicative gradients and for measuring the final accuracy -- suffices to
further reduce the search time; we explain that as adaptation to downstream
tasks is dominated by prompting style, not dataset size. As a result, we show
that combining these findings yields a fast and robust adaptation algorithm for
downstream tasks. Overall, with a single gradient step on 100 examples and a
quick scan of the top candidate layers and factorization techniques, we can
adapt LLMs to new datasets -- entirely without fine-tuning.

Method: 使用贝叶斯混合专家框架，结合物理路径损耗模型（确保物理一致性）和CNN（利用建筑高度图捕捉城市传播效应），通过对数线性池化进行融合，采用拉普拉斯近似进行贝叶斯推断。

Result: 在城市射线追踪数据上的实验表明，随着训练点增多，定位精度提高且不确定性降低，不确定性集中在干扰源附近和城市峡谷等传播敏感区域。

Conclusion: 该混合框架能够有效改进GNSS干扰源定位和信号强度场重建，同时提供位置和信号强度的后验不确定性估计。

Abstract: Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) signals are vulnerable to jamming,
particularly in urban areas where multipath and shadowing distort received
power. Previous data-driven approaches achieved reasonable localization but
poorly reconstructed the received signal strength (RSS) field due to limited
spatial context. We propose a hybrid Bayesian mixture-of-experts framework that
fuses a physical path-loss (PL) model and a convolutional neural network (CNN)
through log-linear pooling. The PL expert ensures physical consistency, while
the CNN leverages building-height maps to capture urban propagation effects.
Bayesian inference with Laplace approximation provides posterior uncertainty
over both the jammer position and RSS field. Experiments on urban ray-tracing
data show that localization accuracy improves and uncertainty decreases with
more training points, while uncertainty concentrates near the jammer and along
urban canyons where propagation is most sensitive.

Abstract: This is not a typical survey of world models; it is a guide for those who
want to build worlds. We do not aim to catalog every paper that has ever
mentioned a ``world model". Instead, we follow one clear road: from early
masked models that unified representation learning across modalities, to
unified architectures that share a single paradigm, then to interactive
generative models that close the action-perception loop, and finally to
memory-augmented systems that sustain consistent worlds over time. We bypass
loosely related branches to focus on the core: the generative heart, the
interactive loop, and the memory system. We show that this is the most
promising path towards true world models.

Abstract: Decoding visual stimuli from neural population activity is crucial for
understanding the brain and for applications in brain-machine interfaces.
However, such biological data is often scarce, particularly in primates or
humans, where high-throughput recording techniques, such as two-photon imaging,
remain challenging or impossible to apply. This, in turn, poses a challenge for
deep learning decoding techniques. To overcome this, we introduce MEIcoder, a
biologically informed decoding method that leverages neuron-specific most
exciting inputs (MEIs), a structural similarity index measure loss, and
adversarial training. MEIcoder achieves state-of-the-art performance in
reconstructing visual stimuli from single-cell activity in primary visual
cortex (V1), especially excelling on small datasets with fewer recorded
neurons. Using ablation studies, we demonstrate that MEIs are the main drivers
of the performance, and in scaling experiments, we show that MEIcoder can
reconstruct high-fidelity natural-looking images from as few as 1,000-2,500

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种双系统方法来解决持续学习和技能组合重用问题：一个系统推断要执行什么计算，另一个系统执行如何计算。通过概率生成模型描述任务组合性，并使用无监督在线学习方法构建词汇表，实现持续学习而不会灾难性遗忘。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究持续学习和灵活组合技能的神经机制，解决神经网络在持续学习过程中面临的灾难性遗忘问题，探索如何有效重用已学习的计算组件。

Method: 采用双系统方法：what系统通过概率生成模型描述任务组合性，使用无监督在线学习构建词汇表；how系统作为RNN，根据what系统推断的上下文组合低秩组件。

Result: 该方法在示例任务集上表现出高效性和竞争力，具有前向和后向迁移潜力，能够快速组合泛化到未见过的任务，实现持续学习而无灾难性遗忘。

Conclusion: 双系统学习框架通过上下文推断促进低秩RNN组件的创建、学习和重用，为持续学习和技能组合提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: The ability to continually learn, retain and deploy skills to accomplish
goals is a key feature of intelligent and efficient behavior. However, the
neural mechanisms facilitating the continual learning and flexible
(re-)composition of skills remain elusive. Here, we study continual learning
and the compositional reuse of learned computations in recurrent neural network
(RNN) models using a novel two-system approach: one system that infers what
computation to perform, and one that implements how to perform it. We focus on
a set of compositional cognitive tasks commonly studied in neuroscience. To
construct the what system, we first show that a large family of tasks can be
systematically described by a probabilistic generative model, where
compositionality stems from a shared underlying vocabulary of discrete task
epochs. The shared epoch structure makes these tasks inherently compositional.
We first show that this compositionality can be systematically described by a
probabilistic generative model. Furthermore, We develop an unsupervised online
learning approach that can learn this model on a single-trial basis, building
its vocabulary incrementally as it is exposed to new tasks, and inferring the
latent epoch structure as a time-varying computational context within a trial.
We implement the how system as an RNN whose low-rank components are composed
according to the context inferred by the what system. Contextual inference
facilitates the creation, learning, and reuse of low-rank RNN components as new
tasks are introduced sequentially, enabling continual learning without
catastrophic forgetting. Using an example task set, we demonstrate the efficacy
and competitive performance of this two-system learning framework, its
potential for forward and backward transfer, as well as fast compositional
generalization to unseen tasks.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本研究通过数据驱动方法优化约翰霍普金斯跌倒风险评估工具(JHFRAT)，结合临床知识和电子健康记录数据，开发约束评分优化模型，显著提升了跌倒风险预测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 旨在将JHFRAT跌倒风险预测与更多临床有意义的指标对齐，通过数据驱动方法改进住院患者跌倒风险评估和预防。

Method: 回顾性分析54,209例住院患者数据，采用约束评分优化(CSO)模型，结合JHFRAT评估数据和电子健康记录变量，并与基准黑盒模型(XGBoost)进行比较。

Result: CSO模型预测性能显著优于当前JHFRAT(AUC-ROC: 0.91 vs 0.86)，虽然XGBoost性能更优(AUC-ROC=0.94)，但CSO在风险标记变化方面表现更稳健。

Conclusion: 这种基于证据的方法为医疗系统提供了坚实基础，可利用数据驱动优化技术系统性地增强住院患者跌倒预防方案和患者安全，改善风险评估和资源配置。

Abstract: In this study we aim to better align fall risk prediction from the Johns
Hopkins Fall Risk Assessment Tool (JHFRAT) with additional clinically
meaningful measures via a data-driven modelling approach. We conducted a
retrospective analysis of 54,209 inpatient admissions from three Johns Hopkins
Health System hospitals between March 2022 and October 2023. A total of 20,208
admissions were included as high fall risk encounters, and 13,941 were included
as low fall risk encounters. To incorporate clinical knowledge and maintain
interpretability, we employed constrained score optimization (CSO) models on
JHFRAT assessment data and additional electronic health record (EHR) variables.
The model demonstrated significant improvements in predictive performance over
the current JHFRAT (CSO AUC-ROC=0.91, JHFRAT AUC-ROC=0.86). The constrained
score optimization models performed similarly with and without the EHR
variables. Although the benchmark black-box model (XGBoost), improves upon the
performance metrics of the knowledge-based constrained logistic regression
(AUC-ROC=0.94), the CSO demonstrates more robustness to variations in risk
labelling. This evidence-based approach provides a robust foundation for health
systems to systematically enhance inpatient fall prevention protocols and
patient safety using data-driven optimization techniques, contributing to
improved risk assessment and resource allocation in healthcare settings.

TL;DR: 该论文为Thompson采样在强化学习中的理论分析，建立了基于高斯过程先验的遗憾界，解决了值函数非高斯性和Bellman更新递归结构等挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Thompson采样在序列决策中应用广泛，但在强化学习等具有复杂时间结构的场景中理论基础有限，需要建立更严格的理论保证。

Method: 使用具有高斯边际分布的模型，在情节式强化学习中采用联合高斯过程先验对奖励和状态转移进行建模，扩展椭圆势引理到多输出设置。

Result: 证明了遗憾界为$\mathcal{\tilde{O}}(\sqrt{KH\Gamma(KH)})$，其中$K$是情节数，$H$是时间步长，$\Gamma(\cdot)$表示高斯过程模型的复杂度。

Conclusion: 这项工作推进了对Thompson采样在强化学习中理解，展示了结构假设和模型不确定性如何影响其在有限时域马尔可夫决策过程中的性能。

Abstract: Thompson sampling (TS) is a powerful and widely used strategy for sequential
decision-making, with applications ranging from Bayesian optimization to
reinforcement learning (RL). Despite its success, the theoretical foundations
of TS remain limited, particularly in settings with complex temporal structure
such as RL. We address this gap by establishing no-regret guarantees for TS
using models with Gaussian marginal distributions. Specifically, we consider TS
in episodic RL with joint Gaussian process (GP) priors over rewards and
transitions. We prove a regret bound of
$\mathcal{\tilde{O}}(\sqrt{KH\Gamma(KH)})$ over $K$ episodes of horizon $H$,
where $\Gamma(\cdot)$ captures the complexity of the GP model. Our analysis
addresses several challenges, including the non-Gaussian nature of value
functions and the recursive structure of Bellman updates, and extends classical
tools such as the elliptical potential lemma to multi-output settings. This
work advances the understanding of TS in RL and highlights how structural
assumptions and model uncertainty shape its performance in finite-horizon
Markov Decision Processes.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一种基于狄利克雷过程的多模态学习框架，通过DP的富者愈富特性自动平衡模态内特征学习和跨模态对齐，在多个数据集上表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法过度强调跨模态对齐，可能对模态内特征表达造成过度正则化，需要一种能同时保持模态特征表达性和学习跨模态交互的方法。

Method: 假设每个模态服从多元高斯混合分布，采用狄利克雷过程计算各分量的混合权重，利用DP的富者愈富特性动态分配特征贡献度并选择最显著特征。

Result: 在多个多模态数据集上的实验表明，该模型优于其他竞争方法，消融分析验证了DP在模态分布对齐中的有效性和对关键超参数变化的鲁棒性。

Conclusion: DP驱动的多模态学习框架能自动实现模态内表示学习和跨模态对齐的最优平衡，为多模态融合提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Developing effective multimodal fusion approaches has become increasingly
essential in many real-world scenarios, such as health care and finance. The
key challenge is how to preserve the feature expressiveness in each modality
while learning cross-modal interactions. Previous approaches primarily focus on
the cross-modal alignment, while over-emphasis on the alignment of marginal
distributions of modalities may impose excess regularization and obstruct
meaningful representations within each modality. The Dirichlet process (DP)
mixture model is a powerful Bayesian non-parametric method that can amplify the
most prominent features by its richer-gets-richer property, which allocates
increasing weights to them. Inspired by this unique characteristic of DP, we
propose a new DP-driven multimodal learning framework that automatically
achieves an optimal balance between prominent intra-modal representation
learning and cross-modal alignment. Specifically, we assume that each modality
follows a mixture of multivariate Gaussian distributions and further adopt DP
to calculate the mixture weights for all the components. This paradigm allows
DP to dynamically allocate the contributions of features and select the most
prominent ones, leveraging its richer-gets-richer property, thus facilitating
multimodal feature fusion. Extensive experiments on several multimodal datasets
demonstrate the superior performance of our model over other competitors.
Ablation analysis further validates the effectiveness of DP in aligning
modality distributions and its robustness to changes in key hyperparameters.

TL;DR: 本文研究了270M参数的象棋Transformer模型在分布外场景下的表现，发现模型具有组合泛化能力，能够遵守象棋基本规则并生成高质量走法，但在更具挑战性的Chess960变体中表现不如符号AI算法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究现代决策Transformer是否真正理解象棋规则，而不仅仅是学习训练数据中的模式，通过分布外测试来评估其系统性泛化能力。

Method: 训练270M参数的象棋Transformer模型，并在多种分布外场景下测试，包括规则外推、OOD谜题和Chess960变体，同时分析训练动态。

Result: 模型展现出组合泛化能力，能够一致选择有效走法，在OOD谜题中生成高质量走法。在Chess960中表现不如符号AI，但与人类玩家对弈时差距较小。训练动态显示模型先学会移动己方棋子。

Conclusion: Transformer模型能够学习象棋的基本组成规则，具有组合泛化能力，但在需要深度战略规划的复杂变体中仍不如传统符号AI方法。

Abstract: Chess is a canonical example of a task that requires rigorous reasoning and
long-term planning. Modern decision Transformers - trained similarly to LLMs -
are able to learn competent gameplay, but it is unclear to what extent they
truly capture the rules of chess. To investigate this, we train a 270M
parameter chess Transformer and test it on out-of-distribution scenarios,
designed to reveal failures of systematic generalization. Our analysis shows
that Transformers exhibit compositional generalization, as evidenced by strong
rule extrapolation: they adhere to fundamental syntactic rules of the game by
consistently choosing valid moves even in situations very different from the
training data. Moreover, they also generate high-quality moves for OOD puzzles.
In a more challenging test, we evaluate the models on variants including
Chess960 (Fischer Random Chess) - a variant of chess where starting positions
of pieces are randomized. We found that while the model exhibits basic strategy
adaptation, they are inferior to symbolic AI algorithms that perform explicit
search, but gap is smaller when playing against users on Lichess. Moreover, the
training dynamics revealed that the model initially learns to move only its own
pieces, suggesting an emergent compositional understanding of the game.

*Liang Ye,Shengqin Chen,Jiazhu Dai*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: BadGraph是一种针对文本引导图生成的潜在扩散模型的后门攻击方法，通过文本触发器毒化训练数据，在推理时植入攻击者指定的子图，同时保持对干净输入的正常性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着图生成技术的快速发展，后门漏洞等安全问题日益突出。虽然已有研究探索了图像扩散和无条件图生成中的后门攻击，但文本引导的图生成领域仍未被充分研究。

Method: BadGraph利用文本触发器毒化训练数据，在潜在扩散模型的训练过程中植入后门，使得在推理阶段当触发器出现时生成攻击者指定的子图。

Result: 在四个基准数据集上的实验表明，攻击具有高效性和隐蔽性：不到10%的毒化率即可达到50%的攻击成功率，24%的毒化率可实现超过80%的成功率，且对良性样本的性能影响可忽略不计。

Conclusion: 这些发现揭示了文本引导图生成的潜在扩散模型中的安全漏洞，强调了在药物发现等应用中的严重风险，并凸显了对此类扩散模型中后门攻击进行鲁棒防御的必要性。

Abstract: The rapid progress of graph generation has raised new security concerns,
particularly regarding backdoor vulnerabilities. While prior work has explored
backdoor attacks in image diffusion and unconditional graph generation,
conditional, especially text-guided graph generation remains largely
unexamined. This paper proposes BadGraph, a backdoor attack method targeting
latent diffusion models for text-guided graph generation. BadGraph leverages
textual triggers to poison training data, covertly implanting backdoors that
induce attacker-specified subgraphs during inference when triggers appear,
while preserving normal performance on clean inputs. Extensive experiments on
four benchmark datasets (PubChem, ChEBI-20, PCDes, MoMu) demonstrate the
effectiveness and stealth of the attack: less than 10% poisoning rate can
achieves 50% attack success rate, while 24% suffices for over 80% success rate,
with negligible performance degradation on benign samples. Ablation studies
further reveal that the backdoor is implanted during VAE and diffusion training
rather than pretraining. These findings reveal the security vulnerabilities in
latent diffusion models of text-guided graph generation, highlight the serious
risks in models' applications such as drug discovery and underscore the need
for robust defenses against the backdoor attack in such diffusion models.

### [195] [KL-Regularized Reinforcement Learning is Designed to Mode Collapse](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20817)
*Anthony GX-Chen,Jatin Prakash,Jeff Guo,Rob Fergus,Rajesh Ranganath*

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文挑战了关于KL散度优化的传统直觉，发现在强化学习中反向/前向KL正则化的选择主要决定最优目标分布的参数化形式，而非模式覆盖。作者提出了一种简单算法，通过最小化奖励幅度调整来优化覆盖所有高质量采样模式的目标分布。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统观点认为反向KL散度优化导致"模式寻找"，前向KL导致"质量覆盖"，后者在需要多样采样时更受青睐。但作者发现这种直觉在强化学习KL正则化中并不适用，需要重新理解KL散度的作用机制。

Method: 作者通过数学分析和实证研究，揭示了KL散度选择如何参数化最优目标分布。基于这些洞察，构建了一个简单、可扩展的理论合理算法，仅对奖励幅度做最小调整，就能优化覆盖所有高质量采样模式的目标分布。

Result: 实验表明，该简单修改在大型语言模型和化学语言模型的后训练中都有效，提高了解决方案质量和多样性，无需外部多样性信号，且在前向和反向KL单独使用失败时都能工作。

Conclusion: KL散度选择主要决定目标分布的参数化形式，模式覆盖更多取决于正则化强度、奖励与参考概率的相对尺度等因素。提出的算法能有效提升模型输出的多样性和质量。

Abstract: It is commonly believed that optimizing the reverse KL divergence results in
"mode seeking", while optimizing forward KL results in "mass covering", with
the latter being preferred if the goal is to sample from multiple diverse
modes. We show -- mathematically and empirically -- that this intuition does
not necessarily transfer well to doing reinforcement learning with
reverse/forward KL regularization (e.g. as commonly used with language models).
Instead, the choice of reverse/forward KL determines the family of optimal
target distributions, parameterized by the regularization coefficient. Mode
coverage depends primarily on other factors, such as regularization strength,
and relative scales between rewards and reference probabilities. Further, we
show commonly used settings such as low regularization strength and equal
verifiable rewards tend to specify unimodal target distributions, meaning the
optimization objective is, by construction, non-diverse. We leverage these
insights to construct a simple, scalable, and theoretically justified
algorithm. It makes minimal changes to reward magnitudes, yet optimizes for a
target distribution which puts high probability over all high-quality sampling
modes. In experiments, this simple modification works to post-train both Large
Language Models and Chemical Language Models to have higher solution quality
and diversity, without any external signals of diversity, and works with both
forward and reverse KL when using either naively fails.

*Max B. Zhao,Fei Li*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出并评估了一种量子启发算法，用于解决二次无约束二元优化(QUBO)问题，该算法使用矩阵乘积态(MPS)和离散驱动调度来寻找全局最小值。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决QUBO问题在数学上等同于寻找Ising自旋玻璃哈密顿量的基态，需要开发可扩展且能可靠找到全局最优解的方法。

Method: 使用矩阵乘积态(MPS)紧凑表示自旋构型的大叠加，结合离散驱动调度和DMRG方法迭代最小化系统能量。

Result: 算法成功解决了涉及200多个Ising自旋的Sudoku谜题和Biq Mac库中最多251个节点、3265条边的MaxCut问题实例。

Conclusion: 该量子启发方法具有可扩展性、通用性和适用于工业级QUBO应用的优势。

Abstract: We propose and evaluate a quantum-inspired algorithm for solving Quadratic
Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problems, which are mathematically
equivalent to finding ground states of Ising spin-glass Hamiltonians. The
algorithm employs Matrix Product States (MPS) to compactly represent large
superpositions of spin configurations and utilizes a discrete driving schedule
to guide the MPS toward the ground state. At each step, a driver Hamiltonian --
incorporating a transverse magnetic field -- is combined with the problem
Hamiltonian to enable spin flips and facilitate quantum tunneling. The MPS is
updated using the standard Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) method,
which iteratively minimizes the system's energy via multiple sweeps across the
spin chain. Despite its heuristic nature, the algorithm reliably identifies
global minima, not merely near-optimal solutions, across diverse QUBO
instances. We first demonstrate its effectiveness on intermediate-level Sudoku
puzzles from publicly available sources, involving over $200$ Ising spins with
long-range couplings dictated by constraint satisfaction. We then apply the
algorithm to MaxCut problems from the Biq Mac library, successfully solving
instances with up to $251$ nodes and $3,265$ edges. We discuss the advantages
of this quantum-inspired approach, including its scalability, generalizability,
and suitability for industrial-scale QUBO applications.

TL;DR: 该研究提出了分析可靠性基准(ARB)，这是首个用于量化能源系统分析中大语言模型推理可靠性的标准化框架，包含五个子指标，并在确定性、概率性和认知性场景下评估了四个前沿模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前人工智能在能源领域的应用缺乏标准化框架来评估系统推理的正确性，现有验证实践主要关注预测准确性或计算效率，而忽略了分析结论的逻辑完整性。

Method: 开发了分析可靠性基准(ARB)，整合了准确性、推理可靠性、不确定性纪律、政策一致性和透明度五个子指标，使用开放技术经济数据集(NREL ATB 2024等)，在相同事实和监管条件下测试了GPT-4/5、Claude 4.5 Sonnet、Gemini 2.5 Pro和Llama 3 70B四个模型。

Result: 结果显示推理可靠性可以被客观测量：GPT-4/5和Claude 4.5 Sonnet实现了持续且符合政策的推理(分析可靠性指数大于90)，Gemini 2.5 Pro表现出中等稳定性，而Llama 3 70B低于专业阈值。统计验证证实这些差异是显著且可复现的。

Conclusion: ARB建立了能源文献中首个验证人工智能系统中因果、概率和政策驱动推理的定量方法，为全球能源转型中可信赖和透明的分析应用提供了参考框架。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence and machine learning are increasingly used for
forecasting, optimization, and policy design in the energy sector, yet no
standardized framework exists to evaluate whether these systems reason
correctly. Current validation practices focus on predictive accuracy or
computational efficiency, leaving the logical integrity of analytical
conclusions untested. This study introduces the Analytical Reliability
Benchmark (ARB), a reproducible framework that quantifies reasoning reliability
in large language models applied to energy system analysis. The benchmark
integrates five submetrics: accuracy, reasoning reliability, uncertainty
discipline, policy consistency, and transparency, and evaluates model
performance across deterministic, probabilistic, and epistemic scenarios using
open technoeconomic datasets (NREL ATB 2024, DOE H2A/H2New, IEA WEO 2024). Four
frontier models (GPT-4/5, Claude 4.5 Sonnet, Gemini 2.5 Pro, Llama 3 70B) were
tested under identical factual and regulatory conditions. Results show that
reasoning reliability can be objectively measured. GPT-4/5 and Claude 4.5
Sonnet achieved consistent and policy-compliant reasoning (Analytical
Reliability Index greater than 90), Gemini 2.5 Pro demonstrated moderate
stability, and Llama 3 70B remained below professional thresholds. Statistical
validation confirmed that these differences are significant and reproducible.
The ARB establishes the first quantitative method in the energy literature for
verifying causal, probabilistic, and policy-driven reasoning in artificial
intelligence systems, providing a reference framework for trustworthy and
transparent analytical applications in the global energy transition.

Method: 采用显式子任务管理和树结构探索实现可控多分支推理，通过网页状态回放进行高效探索，并利用页面动作记忆在会话内外共享已探索的动作。

Conclusion: Branch-and-Browse是一个可靠且高效的基于LLM的网络代理框架，在推理深度和执行效率方面表现出色。

Abstract: Autonomous web agents powered by large language models (LLMs) show strong
potential for performing goal-oriented tasks such as information retrieval,
report generation, and online transactions. These agents mark a key step toward
practical embodied reasoning in open web environments. However, existing
approaches remain limited in reasoning depth and efficiency: vanilla linear
methods fail at multi-step reasoning and lack effective backtracking, while
other search strategies are coarse-grained and computationally costly. We
introduce Branch-and-Browse, a fine-grained web agent framework that unifies
structured reasoning-acting, contextual memory, and efficient execution. It (i)
employs explicit subtask management with tree-structured exploration for
controllable multi-branch reasoning, (ii) bootstraps exploration through
efficient web state replay with background reasoning, and (iii) leverages a
page action memory to share explored actions within and across sessions. On the
WebArena benchmark, Branch-and-Browse achieves a task success rate of 35.8\%
and reduces execution time by up to 40.4\% relative to state-of-the-art
methods. These results demonstrate that Branch-and-Browse is a reliable and
efficient framework for LLM-based web agents.

Result: 在标准数学推理数据集上发现不同LLM家族在推理保真度上存在显著差异，即使PASS@k指标相似。

Conclusion: 该框架在自由形式思维链和形式证明系统之间提供了平衡，为LLM推理评估提供了可操作的诊断工具。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) demonstrate strong performance on mathematical
problems when prompted with Chain-of-Thought (CoT), yet it remains unclear
whether this success stems from search, rote procedures, or rule-consistent
reasoning. To address this, we propose modeling CoT as a certain rule-based
stochastic process over directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), where nodes represent
intermediate derivation states and edges encode rule applications. Within this
framework, we introduce logical closeness, a metric that quantifies how well a
model's CoT trajectory (i.e., the LLM's final output) adheres to the DAG
structure, providing evaluation beyond classical PASS@k metrics. Building on
this, we introduce the DAG-MATH CoT format and construct a benchmark that
guides LLMs to generate CoT trajectories in this format, thereby enabling the
evaluation of their reasoning ability under our framework. Across standard
mathematical reasoning datasets, our analysis uncovers statistically
significant differences in reasoning fidelity among representative LLM
families-even when PASS@k is comparable-highlighting gaps between final-answer
accuracy and rule-consistent derivation. Our framework provides a balance
between free-form CoT and formal proofs systems, offering actionable
diagnostics for LLMs reasoning evaluation. Our benchmark and code are available

Method: 使用共享的模态特定编码器处理分类、数值、文本和时间属性，然后通过Perceiver风格的交叉注意力模块将特征聚合成固定大小的节点表示。

Result: 在RelBench基准测试中，RELATE在ReLGNN和HGT上的性能达到模式特定编码器的97%，同时参数数量减少最多5倍。

Conclusion: RELATE支持不同模式，使通用图神经网络能够进行多数据集预训练，为关系图数据的基础模型铺平了道路。

Abstract: Relational multi-table data is common in domains such as e-commerce,
healthcare, and scientific research, and can be naturally represented as
heterogeneous temporal graphs with multi-modal node attributes. Existing graph
neural networks (GNNs) rely on schema-specific feature encoders, requiring
separate modules for each node type and feature column, which hinders
scalability and parameter sharing. We introduce RELATE (Relational Encoder for
Latent Aggregation of Typed Entities), a schema-agnostic, plug-and-play feature
encoder that can be used with any general purpose GNN. RELATE employs shared
modality-specific encoders for categorical, numerical, textual, and temporal
attributes, followed by a Perceiver-style cross-attention module that
aggregates features into a fixed-size, permutation-invariant node
representation. We evaluate RELATE on ReLGNN and HGT in the RelBench benchmark,
where it achieves performance within 3% of schema-specific encoders while
reducing parameter counts by up to 5x. This design supports varying schemas and
enables multi-dataset pretraining for general-purpose GNNs, paving the way
toward foundation models for relational graph data.

### [202] [A new wave of vehicle insurance fraud fueled by generative AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19957)
*Amir Hever,Itai Orr*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 生成式AI正在加剧保险欺诈，使大规模快速伪造事故证据成为可能。保险公司采用AI检测工具应对，但面临误报、漏报等挑战。UVeye提出分层解决方案来检测和威慑这种新型欺诈。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 保险欺诈每年造成数百亿美元损失，传统欺诈手段包括伪造事故、夸大损失等。生成式AI的出现使欺诈者能轻松制造逼真的碰撞照片、损坏证据和假身份，加剧了保险欺诈问题。

Method: 保险公司部署基于AI的深度伪造检测软件和增强验证流程来检测AI驱动的欺诈。UVeye提出了针对车辆欺诈的分层解决方案。

Result: 当前检测工具存在误报和漏报问题，复杂的欺诈者不断调整策略规避自动检查。保险公司面临资源和成本障碍，对抗AI驱动的保险欺诈仍是持续挑战。

Conclusion: 生成式AI与检测技术之间的猫鼠游戏，加上保险公司的资源限制，意味着对抗AI驱动的保险欺诈是一个持续挑战。UVeye的分层解决方案代表了检测和威慑这种新型欺诈能力的重大进步。

Abstract: Generative AI is supercharging insurance fraud by making it easier to falsify
accident evidence at scale and in rapid time. Insurance fraud is a pervasive
and costly problem, amounting to tens of billions of dollars in losses each
year. In the vehicle insurance sector, fraud schemes have traditionally
involved staged accidents, exaggerated damage, or forged documents. The rise of
generative AI, including deepfake image and video generation, has introduced
new methods for committing fraud at scale. Fraudsters can now fabricate highly
realistic crash photos, damage evidence, and even fake identities or documents
with minimal effort, exploiting AI tools to bolster false insurance claims.
Insurers have begun deploying countermeasures such as AI-based deepfake
detection software and enhanced verification processes to detect and mitigate
these AI-driven scams. However, current mitigation strategies face significant
limitations. Detection tools can suffer from false positives and negatives, and
sophisticated fraudsters continuously adapt their tactics to evade automated
checks. This cat-and-mouse arms race between generative AI and detection
technology, combined with resource and cost barriers for insurers, means that
combating AI-enabled insurance fraud remains an ongoing challenge. In this
white paper, we present UVeye layered solution for vehicle fraud, representing
a major leap forward in the ability to detect, mitigate and deter this new wave
of fraud.

TL;DR: 该研究使用机器学习模型通过领导力人格特质预测学业成功，在129名环境工程硕士生中实现了87.5%的预测准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索AI技术在个性化学习中的潜力，通过领导力人格特质预测学业表现，为早期识别学生优劣势提供机会。

Method: 收集129名硕士生的5项领导力人格测试数据（23个特征），结合平均成绩，使用7种机器学习算法进行建模，包括SVM、LR、KNN、DT、GB、RF、XGBoost和LightGBM。

Result: 随机森林分类器表现最佳，包含17个人格特征和领导力标记特征的模型准确率达87.50%，不包含该特征的模型准确率为85.71%。

Conclusion: 该研究为教育过程中早期识别学生优劣势和选择最适合的个性化学习策略提供了额外机会。

Abstract: The study explores the potential of AI technologies in personalized learning,
suggesting the prediction of academic success through leadership personality
traits and machine learning modelling. The primary data were obtained from 129
master's students in the Environmental Engineering Department, who underwent
five leadership personality tests with 23 characteristics. Students used
self-assessment tools that included Personality Insight, Workplace Culture,
Motivation at Work, Management Skills, and Emotion Control tests. The test
results were combined with the average grade obtained from academic reports.
The study employed exploratory data analysis and correlation analysis. Feature
selection utilized Pearson correlation coefficients of personality traits. The
average grades were separated into three categories: fail, pass, and excellent.
The modelling process was performed by tuning seven ML algorithms, such as SVM,
LR, KNN, DT, GB, RF, XGBoost and LightGBM. The highest predictive performance
was achieved with the RF classifier, which yielded an accuracy of 87.50% for
the model incorporating 17 personality trait features and the leadership mark
feature, and an accuracy of 85.71% for the model excluding this feature. In
this way, the study offers an additional opportunity to identify students'
strengths and weaknesses at an early stage of their education process and
select the most suitable strategies for personalized learning.

*Antonio Norelli,Michael Bronstein*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种使用大型语言模型将秘密信息隐藏在看似普通文本中的协议，展示了文本与作者意图的彻底分离，对AI安全和信任构成威胁


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索大型语言模型如何能够将完全不同的信息隐藏在看似连贯合理的文本中，揭示文本与作者意图的脱节现象

Method: 使用简单的协议，即使是80亿参数的开源LLM也能在笔记本电脑上快速编码和解码隐藏信息

Result: 成功实现了在相同长度的文本中隐藏秘密信息，例如将政治批判隐藏在赞美文本中，或把秘密手稿隐藏在普通产品评论中

Conclusion: 这种技术进一步削弱了对书面通信的信任，对AI安全提出了紧迫问题，并挑战了我们对LLM知识概念的理解

Abstract: A meaningful text can be hidden inside another, completely different yet
still coherent and plausible, text of the same length. For example, a tweet
containing a harsh political critique could be embedded in a tweet that
celebrates the same political leader, or an ordinary product review could
conceal a secret manuscript. This uncanny state of affairs is now possible
thanks to Large Language Models, and in this paper we present a simple and
efficient protocol to achieve it. We show that even modest 8-billion-parameter
open-source LLMs are sufficient to obtain high-quality results, and a message
as long as this abstract can be encoded and decoded locally on a laptop in
seconds. The existence of such a protocol demonstrates a radical decoupling of
text from authorial intent, further eroding trust in written communication,
already shaken by the rise of LLM chatbots. We illustrate this with a concrete
scenario: a company could covertly deploy an unfiltered LLM by encoding its
answers within the compliant responses of a safe model. This possibility raises
urgent questions for AI safety and challenges our understanding of what it
means for a Large Language Model to know something.

TL;DR: AI PB是一个生产级的生成式智能体，在零售金融领域部署，能够主动生成基于事实、合规且个性化的投资洞察，而非被动回答查询。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在金融领域，传统的被动式聊天机器人无法满足主动提供个性化投资洞察的需求，同时需要确保数据安全性和合规性。

Method: 采用组件化编排层进行确定性路由，结合混合检索管道（OpenSearch和金融领域嵌入模型）以及多阶段推荐机制（规则启发式、序列行为建模和上下文赌博机）。

Result: 系统在24个NVIDIA H100 GPU上通过Docker Swarm和vLLM全本地部署，符合韩国金融监管要求，通过人工QA和系统指标验证了其可靠性。

Conclusion: 通过显式路由和分层安全机制的基于事实的生成，可以在高风险金融环境中提供可信的AI洞察。

Abstract: We present AI PB, a production-scale generative agent deployed in real retail
finance. Unlike reactive chatbots that answer queries passively, AI PB
proactively generates grounded, compliant, and user-specific investment
insights. It integrates (i) a component-based orchestration layer that
deterministically routes between internal and external LLMs based on data
sensitivity, (ii) a hybrid retrieval pipeline using OpenSearch and the
finance-domain embedding model, and (iii) a multi-stage recommendation
mechanism combining rule heuristics, sequential behavioral modeling, and
contextual bandits. Operating fully on-premises under Korean financial
regulations, the system employs Docker Swarm and vLLM across 24 X NVIDIA H100
GPUs. Through human QA and system metrics, we demonstrate that grounded
generation with explicit routing and layered safety can deliver trustworthy AI
insights in high-stakes finance.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: HCLA是一个以人为中心的多智能体异常检测系统，用于数字资产交易分析。它将解析、检测和解释三个角色连接成对话式工作流，让非专家用户能够用自然语言提问、检查结构化分析并获得情境感知的解释。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为了解决数字资产交易异常检测中非专家用户难以理解和信任检测结果的问题，需要开发一个透明且可交互的系统，提高金融取证的可信度。

Method: 系统采用多智能体架构，包含解析、检测和解释三个角色，通过对话式工作流将用户意图转换为经典检测器（XGBoost）的输入模式，并基于底层特征生成叙述性解释。

Result: 在标记的比特币混币数据集（Wasabi Wallet，2020-2024）上，基线检测器达到了较高的准确率，而HCLA系统在此基础上增加了可解释性和交互式优化能力。

Conclusion: 人在回路的设计提高了金融取证系统的透明度和信任度，HCLA系统为非专家用户提供了直观的异常检测和解释能力。

Abstract: We present HCLA, a human-centered multi-agent system for anomaly detection in
digital asset transactions. The system links three roles: Parsing, Detection,
and Explanation, into a conversational workflow that lets non-experts ask
questions in natural language, inspect structured analytics, and obtain
context-aware rationales. Implemented with an open-source web UI, HCLA
translates user intents into a schema for a classical detector (XGBoost in our
prototype) and returns narrative explanations grounded in the underlying
features. On a labeled Bitcoin mixing dataset (Wasabi Wallet, 2020-2024), the
baseline detector reaches strong accuracy, while HCLA adds interpretability and
interactive refinement. We describe the architecture, interaction loop,
dataset, evaluation protocol, and limitations, and discuss how a
human-in-the-loop design improves transparency and trust in financial
forensics.

### [207] [The Verification-Value Paradox: A Normative Critique of Gen AI in Legal Practice](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20109)
*Joshua Yuvaraj*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文认为需要重新评估AI在法律实践中的使用，提出了验证-价值悖论，指出AI带来的效率提升会被相应的验证需求所抵消，导致AI使用的净价值对律师来说往往微乎其微。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 鉴于律师因提交不准确的AI生成内容而受到谴责的案例，以及AI与现实脱节、缺乏透明度的特性，需要重新评估AI在法律实践中的使用范式。

Method: 提出了验证-价值悖论这一替代模型，更全面地反映了AI使用的特征，并分析了该悖论对法律实践和法律教育的影响。

Result: AI在法律实践中带来的效率提升会被相应的验证需求所抵消，导致AI使用的净价值往往微乎其微。

Conclusion: 需要建立新的AI使用范式，强调对真相的忠诚和公民责任等价值观在法律实践中的基础地位。

Abstract: It is often claimed that machine learning-based generative AI products will
drastically streamline and reduce the cost of legal practice. This enthusiasm
assumes lawyers can effectively manage AI's risks. Cases in Australia and
elsewhere in which lawyers have been reprimanded for submitting inaccurate
AI-generated content to courts suggest this paradigm must be revisited. This
paper argues that a new paradigm is needed to evaluate AI use in practice,
given (a) AI's disconnection from reality and its lack of transparency, and (b)
lawyers' paramount duties like honesty, integrity, and not to mislead the
court. It presents an alternative model of AI use in practice that more
holistically reflects these features (the verification-value paradox). That
paradox suggests increases in efficiency from AI use in legal practice will be
met by a correspondingly greater imperative to manually verify any outputs of
that use, rendering the net value of AI use often negligible to lawyers. The
paper then sets out the paradox's implications for legal practice and legal
education, including for AI use but also the values that the paradox suggests
should undergird legal practice: fidelity to the truth and civic
responsibility.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了TRUST框架，一种透明、去中心化的大语言模型推理审计系统，通过共识机制、分层DAG分解、区块链记录和隐私保护技术解决现有集中式审计的四大挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有大语言模型审计方法存在集中化、不透明、难以扩展的问题，在关键领域部署专有模型存在重大风险。需要解决鲁棒性、可扩展性、透明度和隐私保护四大核心挑战。

Method: TRUST框架包含：1) 多样化审计者共识机制，可容忍30%恶意参与者；2) 分层DAG推理轨迹分解，支持可扩展并行审计；3) 区块链账本记录验证决策；4) 隐私保护分割，仅共享部分推理步骤。

Result: 在多个LLM（GPT-OSS、DeepSeek-r1、Qwen）和推理任务（数学、医疗、科学、人文）上的实验表明，TRUST能有效检测推理缺陷，并对抗性审计者保持鲁棒性。

Conclusion: TRUST开创了去中心化AI审计的先河，为大语言模型的安全可信部署提供了实用路径，具有理论安全性和经济激励保障。

Abstract: Large Language Models generate complex reasoning chains that reveal their
decision-making, yet verifying the faithfulness and harmlessness of these
intermediate steps remains a critical unsolved problem. Existing auditing
methods are centralized, opaque, and hard to scale, creating significant risks
for deploying proprietary models in high-stakes domains. We identify four core
challenges: (1) Robustness: Centralized auditors are single points of failure,
prone to bias or attacks. (2) Scalability: Reasoning traces are too long for
manual verification. (3) Opacity: Closed auditing undermines public trust. (4)
Privacy: Exposing full reasoning risks model theft or distillation. We propose
TRUST, a transparent, decentralized auditing framework that overcomes these
limitations via: (1) A consensus mechanism among diverse auditors, guaranteeing
correctness under up to $30\%$ malicious participants. (2) A hierarchical DAG
decomposition of reasoning traces, enabling scalable, parallel auditing. (3) A
blockchain ledger that records all verification decisions for public
accountability. (4) Privacy-preserving segmentation, sharing only partial
reasoning steps to protect proprietary logic. We provide theoretical guarantees
for the security and economic incentives of the TRUST framework. Experiments
across multiple LLMs (GPT-OSS, DeepSeek-r1, Qwen) and reasoning tasks (math,
medical, science, humanities) show TRUST effectively detects reasoning flaws
and remains robust against adversarial auditors. Our work pioneers
decentralized AI auditing, offering a practical path toward safe and
trustworthy LLM deployment.

### [209] [The Lock-In Phase Hypothesis: Identity Consolidation as a Precursor to AGI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20190)
*Marcelo Maciel Amaral,Raymond Aschheim*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文提出AGI发展需要经历从开放模仿到身份固化的锁定阶段，通过实验展示了不同规模模型在行为固化过程中的表现差异，认为这种固化是AGI可靠性的前提，也是安全性的关键控制点。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大型语言模型过于开放和可操控，而真正的AGI发展需要经历身份固化阶段，使目标结构、拒绝行为、偏好和内部表征变得稳定且抵抗外部操控。

Method: 通过形式化这一锁定阶段，将其与学习动力学中的已知现象联系起来，并提出了操作性指标来检测固化开始。实验研究了不同规模模型的行为固化过程。

Result: 实验显示行为固化是快速且非线性的，但对通用能力的影响不是单一的：小模型出现性能权衡，中等规模模型几乎无成本地完成固化，大型量化模型出现瞬时不稳定性。

Conclusion: 身份固化是AGI级别可靠性的先决条件，也是安全性的关键控制点，既可以工程化设计可靠身份，也可能在扩展过程中自发形成，从而固化不可预测的目标和行为。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) remain broadly open and highly steerable: they
imitate at scale, accept arbitrary system prompts, and readily adopt multiple
personae. By analogy to human development, we hypothesize that progress toward
artificial general intelligence (AGI) involves a lock-in phase: a transition
from open imitation to identity consolidation, in which goal structures,
refusals, preferences, and internal representations become comparatively stable
and resistant to external steering. We formalize this phase, link it to known
phenomena in learning dynamics, and propose operational metrics for onset
detection. Experimentally, we demonstrate that while the behavioral
consolidation is rapid and non-linear, its side-effects on general capabilities
are not monolithic. Our results reveal a spectrum of outcomes--from performance
trade-offs in small models, through largely cost-free adoption in mid-scale
models, to transient instabilities in large, quantized models. We argue that
such consolidation is a prerequisite for AGI-level reliability and also a
critical control point for safety: identities can be deliberately engineered
for reliability, yet may also emerge spontaneously during scaling, potentially
hardening unpredictable goals and behaviors.

TL;DR: 该论文研究了在动态环境中优化AI的方法，通过进化训练技术来改进AI在2048游戏中的表现。实验比较了单智能体系统和双智能体系统，发现单智能体系统通过价值函数优化取得了显著改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 优化AI在动态环境中的性能是机器学习研究的基本挑战。2048游戏结合了策略性游戏和随机元素，为研究决策制定、长期规划和动态适应提供了理想平台。

Method: 实现了两种系统：双智能体元提示系统（一个"思考者"LLM为"执行者"LLM优化策略）和基于价值函数优化的单智能体系统（使用有限蒙特卡洛树搜索）。还实验了回滚功能以避免性能退化。

Result: 单智能体系统取得了显著改进，每个训练周期平均增加473.2分，且呈现明显上升趋势（相关性ρ=0.607）。LLM对游戏的理解也随着更高级策略的发展而增长。相反，双智能体系统改进有限，突显了元提示的内在局限性。

Conclusion: 研究证明了进化优化技术在非确定性环境中改进AI性能的潜力，单智能体系统表现优异，而元提示方法存在固有局限。

Abstract: Optimizing artificial intelligence (AI) for dynamic environments remains a
fundamental challenge in machine learning research. In this paper, we examine
evolutionary training methods for optimizing AI to solve the game 2048, a 2D
sliding puzzle. 2048, with its mix of strategic gameplay and stochastic
elements, presents an ideal playground for studying decision-making, long-term
planning, and dynamic adaptation. We implemented two distinct systems: a
two-agent metaprompting system where a "thinker" large language model (LLM)
agent refines gameplay strategies for an "executor" LLM agent, and a
single-agent system based on refining a value function for a limited Monte
Carlo Tree Search. We also experimented with rollback features to avoid
performance degradation. Our results demonstrate the potential of evolutionary
refinement techniques in improving AI performance in non-deterministic
environments. The single-agent system achieved substantial improvements, with
an average increase of 473.2 points per cycle, and with clear upward trends
(correlation $\rho$=0.607) across training cycles. The LLM's understanding of
the game grew as well, shown in its development of increasingly advanced
strategies. Conversely, the two-agent system did not garner much improvement,
highlighting the inherent limits of meta-prompting.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文提出了个性化认知模拟(ICS)任务，评估不同认知表征方法在模拟个体思维过程方面的效果，通过构建小说数据集和11条件认知评估框架测试了7个现成LLM在作者风格模仿中的表现。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然大型语言模型能够模仿表面的人类行为，但它们在模拟更深层次个性化认知过程方面的能力仍不清楚，需要系统评估LLM在个性化认知模拟中的表现。

Method: 构建基于近期出版小说（晚于测试LLM发布日期）的数据集，提出11条件认知评估框架，测试不同认知表征方法（语言特征、概念映射、基于档案的信息）在作者风格模仿中的效果。

Result: 概念和语言特征组合在ICS中特别有效，在整体评估中优于基于静态档案的线索；LLM在模仿语言风格方面比叙事结构更有效，显示了在更深层认知模拟中的局限性。

Conclusion: 这些发现为开发适应个体思维和表达方式的AI系统奠定了基础，推进了更个性化和人类对齐的创意技术发展。

Abstract: Individualized cognitive simulation (ICS) aims to build computational models
that approximate the thought processes of specific individuals. While large
language models (LLMs) convincingly mimic surface-level human behavior such as
role-play, their ability to simulate deeper individualized cognitive processes
remains poorly understood. To address this gap, we introduce a novel task that
evaluates different cognitive representation methods in ICS. We construct a
dataset from recently published novels (later than the release date of the
tested LLMs) and propose an 11-condition cognitive evaluation framework to
benchmark seven off-the-shelf LLMs in the context of authorial style emulation.
We hypothesize that effective cognitive representations can help LLMs generate
storytelling that better mirrors the original author. Thus, we test different
cognitive representations, e.g., linguistic features, concept mappings, and
profile-based information. Results show that combining conceptual and
linguistic features is particularly effective in ICS, outperforming static
profile-based cues in overall evaluation. Importantly, LLMs are more effective
at mimicking linguistic style than narrative structure, underscoring their
limits in deeper cognitive simulation. These findings provide a foundation for
developing AI systems that adapt to individual ways of thinking and expression,
advancing more personalized and human-aligned creative technologies.

TL;DR: 使用大型语言模型通过上下文学习生成抽象PDDL领域和问题实例，以支持基于自然语言目标的规划、推理和解释。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 为动态领域生成符合特定目的的抽象仍然是一个重大挑战，因为抽象选择会影响智能体的规划、推理和解释能力。

Method: 在PDDL中建模智能体具体行为，使用LLM进行上下文学习生成抽象PDDL领域和问题实例，考虑三种抽象类别：替代具体动作、动作序列和动作/谓词参数的抽象。

Result: GPT-4o在简单设置下通常能合成有用的规划领域抽象，但在抽象动作方面比抽象相关流态表现更好。生成的抽象通过符号验证工具和专家验证。

Conclusion: LLM能够有效生成规划领域的抽象表示，为智能体的规划、推理和解释提供支持，但在复杂抽象方面仍有改进空间。

Abstract: Generating an abstraction of a dynamic domain that aligns with a given
purpose remains a significant challenge given that the choice of such an
abstraction can impact an agent's ability to plan, reason, and provide
explanations effectively. We model the agent's concrete behaviors in PDDL and
investigate the use of in-context learning with large language models (LLMs)
for the generation of abstract PDDL domains and problem instances, given an
abstraction objective specified in natural language. The benchmark examples we
use are new and have not been part of the data any LLMs have been trained on.
We consider three categories of abstractions: abstraction of choice of
alternative concrete actions, abstraction of sequences of concrete actions, and
abstraction of action/predicate parameters, as well as combinations of these.
The generated abstract PDDL domains and problem instances are then checked by
symbolic validation tools as well as human experts. Our experiments show that
GPT-4o can generally synthesize useful planning domain abstractions in simple
settings, although it is better at abstracting over actions than over the
associated fluents.

TL;DR: 提出了STaBERT模型，通过整合POI信息和时间描述符来增强人类移动性预测的语义理解，显著提升了预测准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有模型要么只建模位置序列，要么仅将时间信息作为辅助输入，未能充分利用兴趣点(POI)提供的丰富语义上下文。

Method: 在BERT-based移动性模型中融入时间描述符和POI嵌入，构建统一的语义增强移动性表示，提出STaBERT模型。

Result: 单城市预测的GEO-BLEU得分从0.34提升到0.75；多城市预测从0.34提升到0.56。

Conclusion: STaBERT通过整合POI和时间信息，显著改善了人类移动性预测的准确性。

Abstract: Human mobility forecasting is crucial for disaster relief, city planning, and
public health. However, existing models either only model location sequences or
include time information merely as auxiliary input, thereby failing to leverage
the rich semantic context provided by points of interest (POIs). To address
this, we enrich a BERT-based mobility model with derived temporal descriptors
and POI embeddings to better capture the semantics underlying human movement.
We propose STaBERT (Semantic-Temporal aware BERT), which integrates both POI
and temporal information at each location to construct a unified, semantically
enriched representation of mobility. Experimental results show that STaBERT
significantly improves prediction accuracy: for single-city prediction, the
GEO-BLEU score improved from 0.34 to 0.75; for multi-city prediction, from 0.34
to 0.56.

TL;DR: ToolEQA是一个集成外部工具和多步推理的EQA智能体，通过工具获取有用信息来指导探索方向，在减少探索距离的同时提高回答准确率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的EQA方法直接使用视觉语言模型探索环境回答问题，缺乏显式思考和规划，导致推理能力有限、探索效率低下和回答效果不佳。

Method: 提出ToolEQA智能体，集成外部工具进行多步推理；设计自动化的EQA数据生成流程，构建包含推理轨迹的大规模EQA-RT数据集（约18K任务）。

Result: 在EQA-RT-Seen和EQA-RT-Unseen测试集上，ToolEQA相比最先进基线方法成功率提升9.2~20.2%，比零样本版本提升10%；在HM-EQA、OpenEQA和EXPRESS-Bench数据集上也达到最先进性能。

Conclusion: ToolEQA通过集成外部工具和多步推理，显著提升了EQA任务的性能，证明了其在具身问答任务中的有效性和泛化能力。

Abstract: Embodied Question Answering (EQA) requires agents to explore 3D environments
to obtain observations and answer questions related to the scene. Existing
methods leverage VLMs to directly explore the environment and answer questions
without explicit thinking or planning, which limits their reasoning ability and
results in excessive or inefficient exploration as well as ineffective
responses. In this paper, we introduce ToolEQA, an agent that integrates
external tools with multi-step reasoning, where external tools can provide more
useful information for completing the task, helping the model derive better
exploration directions in the next step of reasoning and thus obtaining
additional effective information. This enables ToolEQA to generate more
accurate responses with a shorter exploration distance. To enhance the model's
ability for tool-usage and multi-step reasoning, we further design a novel EQA
data generation pipeline that automatically constructs large-scale EQA tasks
with reasoning trajectories and corresponding answers. Based on the pipeline,
we collect the EQA-RT dataset that contains about 18K tasks, divided into a
training set EQA-RT-Train, and two test sets EQA-RT-Seen (scenes overlapping
with the training set) and EQA-RT-Unseen (novel scenes). Experiments on
EQA-RT-Seen and EQA-RT-Unseen show that ToolEQA improves the success rate by
9.2~20.2% over state-of-the-art baselines, while outperforming the zero-shot
ToolEQA by 10% in success rate. In addition, ToolEQA also achieves
state-of-the-art performance on the HM-EQA, OpenEQA, and EXPRESS-Bench
datasets, demonstrating its generality. Our homepage see

### [215] [Bias by Design? How Data Practices Shape Fairness in AI Healthcare Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20332)
*Anna Arias-Duart,Maria Eugenia Cardello,Atia Cortés*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 论文分析了医疗AI系统在临床实践中整合受限的主要障碍——训练数据的质量和公平性问题，识别了数据收集中存在的多种偏见类型，并提出了改进建议。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管AI在医疗领域具有巨大潜力，但由于训练数据存在偏见，导致AI解决方案难以真正融入临床实践。本研究旨在识别临床数据收集中存在的偏见问题，以促进更公平的AI系统开发。

Method: 基于西班牙国家研发计划中的AI4HealthyAging项目，通过分析多个用例，识别临床数据收集中存在的偏见类型。

Result: 识别出历史偏见、代表性偏见和测量偏见等多种偏见类型，这些偏见体现在性别、年龄、居住环境、社会经济地位、设备和标签等多个变量中。

Conclusion: 提出了改进临床问题设计和数据收集的实用建议，以提高AI系统的公平性和鲁棒性，为未来开发更公平的医疗AI系统提供指导。

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) holds great promise for transforming healthcare.
However, despite significant advances, the integration of AI solutions into
real-world clinical practice remains limited. A major barrier is the quality
and fairness of training data, which is often compromised by biased data
collection practices. This paper draws on insights from the AI4HealthyAging
project, part of Spain's national R&D initiative, where our task was to detect
biases during clinical data collection. We identify several types of bias
across multiple use cases, including historical, representation, and
measurement biases. These biases manifest in variables such as sex, gender,
age, habitat, socioeconomic status, equipment, and labeling. We conclude with
practical recommendations for improving the fairness and robustness of clinical
problem design and data collection. We hope that our findings and experience
contribute to guiding future projects in the development of fairer AI systems
in healthcare.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在AI系统在战场中作用日益增强的时代，确保负责任的打击需要对潜在附带效应进行严格评估。

Method: 采用设计科学方法论，构建统一的知识表示与推理架构，整合时间、空间和力量维度，通过分层结构捕获AI系统类别、打击向量和上下文方面。

Result: 模型通过实例化进行了演示和评估，为构建负责任和可信赖的智能系统奠定了基础。

Conclusion: 该模型为评估军事行动中打击AI系统产生的效应提供了透明推理机制，有助于构建负责任和可信赖的智能系统。

Abstract: In an era where AI (Artificial Intelligence) systems play an increasing role
in the battlefield, ensuring responsible targeting demands rigorous assessment
of potential collateral effects. In this context, a novel collateral damage
assessment model for target engagement of AI systems in military operations is
introduced. The model integrates temporal, spatial, and force dimensions within
a unified Knowledge Representation and Reasoning (KRR) architecture following a
design science methodological approach. Its layered structure captures the
categories and architectural components of the AI systems to be engaged
together with corresponding engaging vectors and contextual aspects. At the
same time, spreading, severity, likelihood, and evaluation metrics are
considered in order to provide a clear representation enhanced by transparent
reasoning mechanisms. Further, the model is demonstrated and evaluated through
instantiation which serves as a basis for further dedicated efforts that aim at
building responsible and trustworthy intelligent systems for assessing the
effects produced by engaging AI systems in military operations.

### [217] [LLM-empowered knowledge graph construction: A survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20345)
*Haonan Bian*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本调查系统回顾了LLM赋能知识图谱构建的最新进展，分析了LLM如何重塑传统的本体工程、知识提取和知识融合三层管道，并探讨了基于模式和无模式两种互补范式。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着大语言模型的出现，知识图谱构建正从基于规则和统计的管道转向语言驱动和生成框架，需要系统梳理这一范式转变的进展和影响。

Method: 从两个互补视角回顾新兴的LLM驱动方法：基于模式的范式强调结构、规范化和一致性；无模式范式强调灵活性、适应性和开放发现。

Result: 系统分析了各阶段的代表性框架、技术机制及其局限性，阐明了LLM与知识图谱之间不断演变的相互作用。

Conclusion: 调查展望了关键趋势和未来研究方向，包括基于KG的LLM推理、智能体系统的动态知识记忆和多模态KG构建，旨在桥接符号知识工程和神经语义理解。

Abstract: Knowledge Graphs (KGs) have long served as a fundamental infrastructure for
structured knowledge representation and reasoning. With the advent of Large
Language Models (LLMs), the construction of KGs has entered a new
paradigm-shifting from rule-based and statistical pipelines to language-driven
and generative frameworks. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of
recent progress in LLM-empowered knowledge graph construction, systematically
analyzing how LLMs reshape the classical three-layered pipeline of ontology
engineering, knowledge extraction, and knowledge fusion.
  We first revisit traditional KG methodologies to establish conceptual
foundations, and then review emerging LLM-driven approaches from two
complementary perspectives: schema-based paradigms, which emphasize structure,
normalization, and consistency; and schema-free paradigms, which highlight
flexibility, adaptability, and open discovery. Across each stage, we synthesize
representative frameworks, analyze their technical mechanisms, and identify
their limitations.
  Finally, the survey outlines key trends and future research directions,
including KG-based reasoning for LLMs, dynamic knowledge memory for agentic
systems, and multimodal KG construction. Through this systematic review, we aim
to clarify the evolving interplay between LLMs and knowledge graphs, bridging
symbolic knowledge engineering and neural semantic understanding toward the
development of adaptive, explainable, and intelligent knowledge systems.

*Tianyi Zhang,Florian Mai,Lucie Flek*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了IKnow框架，通过设计指令-响应对话格式的自监督目标，在无需外部资源的情况下实现语言模型的持续预训练，避免指令跟随能力退化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决指令调优模型在持续预训练时指令跟随能力和语义表示退化的问题，同时克服现有方法依赖原始基础模型或外部知识库的限制。

Method: IKnow框架，基于指令-响应对话格式设计自监督目标，从文本本身挖掘领域知识并学习更深层次的语义编码。

Result: 无需外部资源即可实现语言模型的持续适应，保持指令跟随能力的同时提升领域知识编码。

Conclusion: IKnow提供了一种简单通用的持续预训练框架，能够在资源受限环境下有效适应新领域。

Abstract: Continual pretraining promises to adapt large language models (LLMs) to new
domains using only unlabeled test-time data, but naively applying standard
self-supervised objectives to instruction-tuned models is known to degrade
their instruction-following capability and semantic representations. Existing
fixes assume access to the original base model or rely on knowledge from an
external domain-specific database - both of which pose a realistic barrier in
settings where the base model weights are withheld for safety reasons or
reliable external corpora are unavailable. In this work, we propose
Instruction-Knowledge-Aware Continual Adaptation (IKnow), a simple and general
framework that formulates novel self-supervised objectives in the
instruction-response dialogue format. Rather than depend- ing on external
resources, IKnow leverages domain knowledge embedded within the text itself and
learns to encode it at a deeper semantic level.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 开发了一个基于创造力理论的创新机会生成计算模型，相比ChatGPT4o和Notebook LM能产生更新颖且实用的创新机会，但部分功能效果不佳需要进一步改进。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AI系统在生成创新机会时往往缺乏新颖性，需要开发专门的计算模型来产生既新颖又实用的创新机会。

Method: 基于创造力理论和技巧开发了包含五个功能的计算模型，专门用于生成创新机会，并在酒店业创新项目中进行了测试评估。

Result: 该模型生成的创新机会比Notebook LM和ChatGPT4o更新颖和/或更实用，但并非所有模型功能都对提升新颖性有贡献。

Conclusion: 该计算模型在生成新颖且实用的创新机会方面表现优于现有AI系统，但需要进一步优化模型功能以提升效果。

Abstract: This paper presents a new computational model of creative outcomes, informed
by creativity theories and techniques, which was implemented to generate more
novel opportunities for innovation projects. The model implemented five
functions that were developed to contribute to the generation of innovation
opportunities with higher novelty without loss of usefulness. The model was
evaluated using opportunities generated for an innovation project in the
hospitality sector. The evaluation revealed that the computational model
generated outcomes that were more novel and/or useful than outcomes from
Notebook LM and ChatGPT4o. However, not all model functions contributed to the
generation of more novel opportunities, leading to new directions for further
model development

*Louis Mozart Kamdem Teyou,Luke Friedrichs,N'Dah Jean Kouagou,Caglar Demir,Yasir Mahmood,Stefan Heindorf,Axel-Cyrille Ngonga Ngomo*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出了一种名为EBR的神经推理器，使用嵌入来近似符号推理器的结果，能够在存在不一致和错误数据的现实知识库中稳健运行。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有概念学习方法在现实知识库中部署困难的问题，因为传统描述逻辑推理器对不一致和错误数据不稳健。

Method: EBR神经推理器依赖嵌入来近似符号推理器结果，仅需检索原子概念和存在限制的实例，就能近似SHOIQ描述逻辑中任何概念的实例集合。

Result: 实验表明EBR在缺失和错误数据情况下比现有推理器更稳健，能够有效处理现实知识库中的不一致性。

Conclusion: EBR为神经符号概念学习提供了实用的推理解决方案，使概念学习方法能够部署在真实世界知识库中。

Abstract: Concept learning exploits background knowledge in the form of description
logic axioms to learn explainable classification models from knowledge bases.
Despite recent breakthroughs in neuro-symbolic concept learning, most
approaches still cannot be deployed on real-world knowledge bases. This is due
to their use of description logic reasoners, which are not robust against
inconsistencies nor erroneous data. We address this challenge by presenting a
novel neural reasoner dubbed EBR. Our reasoner relies on embeddings to
approximate the results of a symbolic reasoner. We show that EBR solely
requires retrieving instances for atomic concepts and existential restrictions
to retrieve or approximate the set of instances of any concept in the
description logic $\mathcal{SHOIQ}$. In our experiments, we compare EBR with
state-of-the-art reasoners. Our results suggest that EBR is robust against
missing and erroneous data in contrast to existing reasoners.

*Yiwen Peng,Thomas Bonald,Fabian M. Suchanek*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: FLORA是一种无需训练数据的知识图谱对齐方法，基于模糊逻辑提供可解释的实体和关系对齐，支持悬空实体处理，并在主要基准测试中达到最先进水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有知识图谱对齐方法主要关注实体级对齐，缺乏可解释性且需要训练数据，无法处理悬空实体。

Method: 基于模糊逻辑的迭代方法，同时对齐实体和关系，提供可解释的结果并保证收敛。

Result: 在主要基准测试中达到最先进水平，能够有效处理悬空实体。

Conclusion: FLORA是一种简单有效的无监督知识图谱对齐方法，具有可解释性、收敛性和处理悬空实体的能力。

Abstract: Knowledge graph alignment is the task of matching equivalent entities (that
is, instances and classes) and relations across two knowledge graphs. Most
existing methods focus on pure entity-level alignment, computing the similarity
of entities in some embedding space. They lack interpretable reasoning and need
training data to work. In this paper, we propose FLORA, a simple yet effective
method that (1) is unsupervised, i.e., does not require training data, (2)
provides a holistic alignment for entities and relations iteratively, (3) is
based on fuzzy logic and thus delivers interpretable results, (4) provably
converges, (5) allows dangling entities, i.e., entities without a counterpart
in the other KG, and (6) achieves state-of-the-art results on major benchmarks.

### [222] [Lost in Translation: Policymakers are not really listening to Citizen Concerns about AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20568)
*Susan Ariel Aaronson,Michael Moreno*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该研究比较了澳大利亚、哥伦比亚和美国三个国家的AI治理公众参与情况，发现政府未能建立有效的对话机制，公众参与率极低（低于1%），且政府对反馈的回应有限，导致参与式AI治理的承诺与实践之间存在巨大差距。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究旨在分析各国政府在AI治理中如何征集公众意见，以及这些意见是否真正影响了政策制定，揭示当前参与式AI治理的不足。

Method: 采用景观分析方法，比较澳大利亚、哥伦比亚和美国三个国家征集AI风险和政策反馈的方式，以及这些反馈如何影响治理决策。

Result: 研究发现三个国家均未能建立有意义的对话机制，政府缺乏吸引多样化声音的努力，公众参与率极低，官员对反馈的回应有限，未能形成有效的反馈循环。

Conclusion: 当前参与式AI治理方法难以建立信任和合法性，因为政策制定者未能充分倾听和回应公众关切。作者提出了八项改进建议，包括提升AI素养、扩大参与范围、使用创新参与方法等。

Abstract: The worlds people have strong opinions about artificial intelligence (AI),
and they want policymakers to listen. Governments are inviting public comment
on AI, but as they translate input into policy, much of what citizens say is
lost. Policymakers are missing a critical opportunity to build trust in AI and
its governance. This paper compares three countries, Australia, Colombia, and
the United States, that invited citizens to comment on AI risks and policies.
Using a landscape analysis, the authors examined how each government solicited
feedback and whether that input shaped governance. Yet in none of the three
cases did citizens and policymakers establish a meaningful dialogue.
Governments did little to attract diverse voices or publicize calls for
comment, leaving most citizens unaware or unprepared to respond. In each
nation, fewer than one percent of the population participated. Moreover,
officials showed limited responsiveness to the feedback they received, failing
to create an effective feedback loop. The study finds a persistent gap between
the promise and practice of participatory AI governance. The authors conclude
that current approaches are unlikely to build trust or legitimacy in AI because
policymakers are not adequately listening or responding to public concerns.
They offer eight recommendations: promote AI literacy; monitor public feedback;
broaden outreach; hold regular online forums; use innovative engagement
methods; include underrepresented groups; respond publicly to input; and make
participation easier.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 提出一种图神经网络加速方法，用于电网拓扑优化，通过母线分裂缓解输电拥堵，在GOC 2000总线系统上实现4个数量级的加速，AC可行解在1分钟内获得，最优性差距为2.3%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有求解器无法在近实时内解决大规模系统的混合整数非线性电网拓扑优化问题，机器学习方法在未见拓扑、变化运行条件和不同系统间的泛化能力有限，限制了实际应用。

Method: 构建考虑线性化交流潮流方程的电网拓扑优化问题，开发异构边缘感知消息传递神经网络来预测有效的母线分裂动作作为候选拓扑优化解。

Result: 在GOC 2000总线系统上实现高达4个数量级的加速，在1分钟内提供AC可行解，最优性差距为2.3%。

Conclusion: 该方法在大规模系统的拓扑和跨系统泛化方面，向近实时电网拓扑优化迈出了重要一步。

Abstract: Network topology optimization (NTO) via busbar splitting can mitigate
transmission grid congestion and reduce redispatch costs. However, solving this
mixed-integer non-linear problem for large-scale systems in near-real-time is
currently intractable with existing solvers. Machine learning (ML) approaches
have emerged as a promising alternative, but they have limited generalization
to unseen topologies, varying operating conditions, and different systems,
which limits their practical applicability. This paper formulates NTO for
congestion management problem considering linearized AC PF, and proposes a
graph neural network (GNN)-accelerated approach. We develop a heterogeneous
edge-aware message passing NN to predict effective busbar splitting actions as
candidate NTO solutions. The proposed GNN captures local flow patterns,
achieves generalization to unseen topology changes, and improves
transferability across systems. Case studies show up to 4 orders-of-magnitude
speed-up, delivering AC-feasible solutions within one minute and a 2.3%
optimality gap on the GOC 2000-bus system. These results demonstrate a
significant step toward near-real-time NTO for large-scale systems with
topology and cross-system generalization.

*Heejin Do,Jaehui Hwang,Dongyoon Han,Seong Joon Oh,Sangdoo Yun*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 该论文提出了CaSE（因果逐步评估）方法，通过评估推理步骤的相关性和连贯性来改进大语言模型的推理能力，而不仅仅是关注最终答案的正确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前评估大语言模型主要关注最终答案正确性，这种方法过于粗糙，忽略了推理过程的质量，无法有效指导模型改进。

Method: 引入CaSE方法，将推理质量分解为相关性和连贯性两个维度，并仅使用前序上下文评估每个推理步骤，避免后见之明偏差。

Result: 在MRa-GSM8K和MRa-MATH基准测试上验证了CaSE与人类判断的一致性，并证明使用CaSE评估的数据进行训练能直接提升最终任务性能。

Conclusion: CaSE提供了一个可扩展的框架，用于分析、调试和改进LLM推理，展示了超越有效性检查的实际价值。

Abstract: Evaluating large language models (LLMs) on final-answer correctness is the
dominant paradigm. This approach, however, provides a coarse signal for model
improvement and overlooks the quality of the underlying reasoning process. We
argue that a more granular evaluation of reasoning offers a more effective path
to building robust models. We decompose reasoning quality into two dimensions:
relevance and coherence. Relevance measures if a step is grounded in the
problem; coherence measures if it follows logically from prior steps. To
measure these aspects reliably, we introduce causal stepwise evaluation (CaSE).
This method assesses each reasoning step using only its preceding context,
which avoids hindsight bias. We validate CaSE against human judgments on our
new expert-annotated benchmarks, MRa-GSM8K and MRa-MATH. More importantly, we
show that curating training data with CaSE-evaluated relevance and coherence
directly improves final task performance. Our work provides a scalable
framework for analyzing, debugging, and improving LLM reasoning, demonstrating
the practical value of moving beyond validity checks.

TL;DR: 提出了两种可扩展的随机游走中心性计算算法，能在近线性时间内提供强近似保证，适用于大规模网络。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随机游走中心性是图挖掘中量化节点重要性的基本指标，但现有方法计算成本高，难以应用于大型网络。

Method: 提出了两种算法：一种基于近似Cholesky分解和稀疏逆估计，另一种基于采样有根生成树。

Result: 在大型真实网络（包括超过1000万节点的网络）上的实验证明了算法的效率和近似质量。

Conclusion: 所提出的算法能够高效计算随机游走中心性，为大规模网络分析提供了实用解决方案。

Abstract: Random walk centrality is a fundamental metric in graph mining for
quantifying node importance and influence, defined as the weighted average of
hitting times to a node from all other nodes. Despite its ability to capture
rich graph structural information and its wide range of applications, computing
this measure for large networks remains impractical due to the computational
demands of existing methods. In this paper, we present a novel formulation of
random walk centrality, underpinning two scalable algorithms: one leveraging
approximate Cholesky factorization and sparse inverse estimation, while the
other sampling rooted spanning trees. Both algorithms operate in near-linear
time and provide strong approximation guarantees. Extensive experiments on
large real-world networks, including one with over 10 million nodes,
demonstrate the efficiency and approximation quality of the proposed
algorithms.

Motivation: 构建可信赖的自动决策模型需要可解释性设计，以促进信任、问责制和安全采用。

Method: 形式化定义监督学习设置，分析三类可解释模型家族（特征重要性、规则和实例模型），并整合因果性、公平性和隐私性的正式定义、评估指标和验证程序。

Result: 建立了开发既准确可解释又公平、隐私保护和因果感知的AI系统的理论基础。

Conclusion: MIMOSA框架为构建可信赖的AI系统提供了理论基础，通过模型生成过程中评估伦理指标，实现了可解释性与伦理属性的平衡。

Abstract: Interpretable-by-design models are crucial for fostering trust,
accountability, and safe adoption of automated decision-making models in
real-world applications. In this paper we formalize the ground for the MIMOSA
(Mining Interpretable Models explOiting Sophisticated Algorithms) framework, a
comprehensive methodology for generating predictive models that balance
interpretability with performance while embedding key ethical properties. We
formally define here the supervised learning setting across diverse
decision-making tasks and data types, including tabular data, time series,
images, text, transactions, and trajectories. We characterize three major
families of interpretable models: feature importance, rule, and instance based
models. For each family, we analyze their interpretability dimensions,
reasoning mechanisms, and complexity. Beyond interpretability, we formalize
three critical ethical properties, namely causality, fairness, and privacy,
providing formal definitions, evaluation metrics, and verification procedures
for each. We then examine the inherent trade-offs between these properties and
discuss how privacy requirements, fairness constraints, and causal reasoning
can be embedded within interpretable pipelines. By evaluating ethical measures
during model generation, this framework establishes the theoretical foundations
for developing AI systems that are not only accurate and interpretable but also
fair, privacy-preserving, and causally aware, i.e., trustworthy.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有电商评估基准存在任务多样性有限、缺乏多模态数据、使用合成数据、语言覆盖窄等问题，无法可靠评估LLM在复杂真实电商场景中的表现。

Method: 构建包含6个类别37个任务（含8个多模态任务）的基准，数据主要来自真实客户查询和交易日志；采用半自动流程，由大模型生成候选答案，再由50多名电商和多语言专家审核修改；为每个问题和任务类别定义难度级别。

Result: EcomEval覆盖7种语言（包括5种东南亚低资源语言），提供了多语言视角；基准反映了真实业务交互的嘈杂和异构特性。

Conclusion: EcomEval为评估LLM在电商领域的表现提供了全面、多语言、多模态的基准，支持面向挑战的细粒度评估。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel on general-purpose NLP benchmarks, yet
their capabilities in specialized domains remain underexplored. In e-commerce,
existing evaluations-such as EcomInstruct, ChineseEcomQA, eCeLLM, and Shopping
MMLU-suffer from limited task diversity (e.g., lacking product guidance and
after-sales issues), limited task modalities (e.g., absence of multimodal
data), synthetic or curated data, and a narrow focus on English and Chinese,
leaving practitioners without reliable tools to assess models on complex,
real-world shopping scenarios. We introduce EcomEval, a comprehensive
multilingual and multimodal benchmark for evaluating LLMs in e-commerce.
EcomEval covers six categories and 37 tasks (including 8 multimodal tasks),
sourced primarily from authentic customer queries and transaction logs,
reflecting the noisy and heterogeneous nature of real business interactions. To
ensure both quality and scalability of reference answers, we adopt a
semi-automatic pipeline in which large models draft candidate responses
subsequently reviewed and modified by over 50 expert annotators with strong
e-commerce and multilingual expertise. We define difficulty levels for each
question and task category by averaging evaluation scores across models with
different sizes and capabilities, enabling challenge-oriented and fine-grained
assessment. EcomEval also spans seven languages-including five low-resource
Southeast Asian languages-offering a multilingual perspective absent from prior
work.

Motivation: 需要量化模型在动态扩展环境中的适应性，区分封闭式和开放式基准测试，优先考虑闭环开放式真实世界基准来测试适应性。

Method: 引入流动性指数(FI)基准，评估基于初始、当前和未来环境状态偏差的响应准确性，测量模型理解、预测和适应状态变化的能力。

Result: 建立了量化模型适应性的评估框架，能够区分不同级别的适应性表现。

Conclusion: 真正超级智能的模型应至少具备二阶适应性，通过数字补充实现自我维持计算以获得最佳流动性。

Abstract: This paper introduces the Fluidity Index (FI) to quantify model adaptability
in dynamic, scaling environments. The benchmark evaluates response accuracy
based on deviations in initial, current, and future environment states,
assessing context switching and continuity. We distinguish between closed-ended
and open-ended benchmarks, prioritizing closed-loop open-ended real-world
benchmarks to test adaptability. The approach measures a model's ability to
understand, predict, and adjust to state changes in scaling environments. A
truly super-intelligent model should exhibit at least second-order
adaptability, enabling self-sustained computation through digital replenishment
for optimal fluidity.

Abstract: Thanks to the remarkable human-like capabilities of machine learning (ML)
models in perceptual and cognitive tasks, frameworks integrating ML within
rational agent architectures are gaining traction. Yet, the landscape remains
fragmented and incoherent, often focusing on embedding ML into generic agent
containers while overlooking the expressive power of rational
architectures--such as Belief-Desire-Intention (BDI) agents. This paper
presents a fine-grained systematisation of existing approaches, using the BDI
paradigm as a reference. Our analysis illustrates the fast-evolving literature
on rational agents enhanced by ML, and identifies key research opportunities
and open challenges for designing effective rational ML agents.

TL;DR: 提出基于拓扑数据分析的框架来评估大语言模型推理轨迹质量，替代传统依赖专家标注和图结构度量的方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前评估大语言模型推理轨迹质量的方法依赖专家标注、人工注释和缓慢的成对判断，自动化方法主要使用图结构代理指标但无法明确高质量推理的构成要素。

Method: 引入拓扑数据分析框架，捕捉推理轨迹的几何结构，实现标签高效的自动化评估。

Result: 拓扑特征在评估推理质量方面比标准图指标具有显著更高的预测能力，表明有效推理更适合用高维几何结构而非纯关系图来捕捉。

Conclusion: 紧凑稳定的拓扑特征集能可靠指示轨迹质量，为未来强化学习算法提供实用信号。

Abstract: Evaluating the quality of reasoning traces from large language models remains
understudied, labor-intensive, and unreliable: current practice relies on
expert rubrics, manual annotation, and slow pairwise judgments. Automated
efforts are dominated by graph-based proxies that quantify structural
connectivity but do not clarify what constitutes high-quality reasoning; such
abstractions can be overly simplistic for inherently complex processes. We
introduce a topological data analysis (TDA)-based evaluation framework that
captures the geometry of reasoning traces and enables label-efficient,
automated assessment. In our empirical study, topological features yield
substantially higher predictive power for assessing reasoning quality than
standard graph metrics, suggesting that effective reasoning is better captured

TL;DR: Graph-RFT是一个两阶段强化微调的KGQA框架，通过"规划-KG搜索-网络搜索-思考"范式，使LLM能在知识不完整条件下进行自主规划和跨KG与网络的自适应检索调度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有KGQA方法难以充分利用KG中的丰富知识和LLM的推理能力，特别是在复杂场景中。它们通常假设KG覆盖完整，缺乏判断何时需要外部信息的机制，且推理过程局部短视，无法维持连贯的多步规划。

Method: Graph-RFT采用两阶段方法：1）使用定制化规划-检索数据集进行链式思维微调，激活结构化推理；2）引入规划-检索引导的强化学习过程，结合显式规划和检索动作，采用多奖励设计实现覆盖感知的检索调度。使用笛卡尔启发式规划模块分解复杂问题，逻辑表达式指导工具调用。

Result: 该框架优化了推理检索过程，通过结合结果和检索特定信号的多奖励机制，使模型能够学习何时以及如何有效结合KG和网络检索。

Conclusion: Graph-RFT解决了现有KGQA方法在复杂场景下的局限性，实现了在知识不完整条件下的自主规划和自适应检索调度，提升了多步推理的连贯性和有效性。

Abstract: Knowledge Graph Question Answering aims to answer natural language questions
by reasoning over structured knowledge graphs. While large language models have
advanced KGQA through their strong reasoning capabilities, existing methods
continue to struggle to fully exploit both the rich knowledge encoded in KGs
and the reasoning capabilities of LLMs, particularly in complex scenarios. They
often assume complete KG coverage and lack mechanisms to judge when external
information is needed, and their reasoning remains locally myopic, failing to
maintain coherent multi-step planning, leading to reasoning failures even when
relevant knowledge exists. We propose Graph-RFT, a novel two-stage
reinforcement fine-tuning KGQA framework with a
'plan-KGsearch-and-Websearch-during-think' paradigm, that enables LLMs to
perform autonomous planning and adaptive retrieval scheduling across KG and web
sources under incomplete knowledge conditions. Graph-RFT introduces a
chain-of-thought fine-tuning method with a customized plan-retrieval dataset
activates structured reasoning and resolves the GRPO cold-start problem. It
then introduces a novel plan-retrieval guided reinforcement learning process
integrates explicit planning and retrieval actions with a multi-reward design,
enabling coverage-aware retrieval scheduling. It employs a Cartesian-inspired
planning module to decompose complex questions into ordered subquestions, and
logical expression to guide tool invocation for globally consistent multi-step
reasoning. This reasoning retrieval process is optimized with a multi-reward
combining outcome and retrieval specific signals, enabling the model to learn
when and how to combine KG and web retrieval effectively.

### [232] [A Coherence-Based Measure of AGI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20784)
*Fares Fourati*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于广义均值积分的一致性感知AGI度量方法，替代了传统算术平均方法，强调跨认知领域的平衡能力而非补偿性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有AGI定义使用算术平均，假设领域间能力可补偿，但真正的通用智能应反映所有关键领域的平衡能力。

Method: 基于广义均值在补偿性指数连续体上的积分，构建面积下曲线(AUC)度量，涵盖算术、几何和调和均值机制。

Result: 应用于GPT-4和GPT-5的CHC领域得分，一致性调整的AUC显示尽管算术得分较高(GPT-5达24%)，但距离通用能力仍很远。

Conclusion: 广义均值积分提供了原则性、可解释且更严格的AGI进展度量基础，惩罚能力不平衡并捕捉领域间依赖关系。

Abstract: Recent work by \citet{hendrycks2025agidefinition} formalized
\textit{Artificial General Intelligence} (AGI) as the arithmetic mean of
proficiencies across cognitive domains derived from the Cattell--Horn--Carroll
(CHC) model of human cognition. While elegant, this definition assumes
\textit{compensability} -- that exceptional ability in some domains can offset
failure in others. True general intelligence, however, should reflect
\textit{coherent sufficiency}: balanced competence across all essential
domains. We propose a coherence-aware measure of AGI based on the integral of
generalized means over a continuum of compensability exponents. This
formulation spans arithmetic, geometric, and harmonic regimes, and the
resulting \textit{area under the curve} (AUC) quantifies robustness under
varying compensability assumptions. Unlike the arithmetic mean, which rewards
specialization, the AUC penalizes imbalance and captures inter-domain
dependency. Applied to published CHC-based domain scores for GPT-4 and GPT-5,
the coherence-adjusted AUC reveals that both systems remain far from general
competence despite high arithmetic scores (e.g., GPT-5 at~24\%). Integrating
the generalized mean thus yields a principled, interpretable, and stricter
foundation for measuring genuine progress toward AGI.

Motivation: AI和机器人领域每年产生超过10,000篇论文，研究人员难以跟上快速发展的趋势、跨学科工作和探索专业领域之外的需求。

Method: 构建RDR管道，系统分析研究领域，识别新兴趋势，发现跨领域机会，并为新研究提供具体起点。

Abstract: With the rapid growth of research in AI and robotics now producing over
10,000 papers annually it has become increasingly difficult for researchers to
stay up to date. Fast evolving trends, the rise of interdisciplinary work, and
the need to explore domains beyond one's expertise all contribute to this
challenge. To address these issues, we propose a generalizable pipeline capable
of systematically analyzing any research area: identifying emerging trends,
uncovering cross domain opportunities, and offering concrete starting points
for new inquiry. In this work, we present Real Deep Research (RDR) a
comprehensive framework applied to the domains of AI and robotics, with a
particular focus on foundation models and robotics advancements. We also
briefly extend our analysis to other areas of science. The main paper details
the construction of the RDR pipeline, while the appendix provides extensive
results across each analyzed topic. We hope this work sheds light for
researchers working in the field of AI and beyond.

TL;DR: 该研究通过分析753个用户特征来预测Reddit用户对内容审核干预的行为反应，发现少数关键特征能有效预测用户活动、毒性和多样性的变化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 准确估计用户对内容审核干预的反应对于制定有效的用户中心审核策略至关重要，需要了解哪些用户特征与不同行为反应相关。

Method: 采用量化任务框架，对16.8K用户应用贪婪特征选择策略，分析753个社会行为、语言、关系和心理特征在预测用户行为变化中的重要性。

Result: 识别出一小组在所有任务中一致具有信息量的特征，发现预测性能因任务而异，活动变化和毒性变化比多样性变化更容易估计。

Conclusion: 研究结果为实现准确预测用户对审核干预反应的系统铺平道路，强调有效审核应根据用户特征和干预具体目标进行定制。

Abstract: Accurately estimating how users respond to moderation interventions is
paramount for developing effective and user-centred moderation strategies.
However, this requires a clear understanding of which user characteristics are
associated with different behavioural responses, which is the goal of this
work. We investigate the informativeness of 753 socio-behavioural, linguistic,
relational, and psychological features, in predicting the behavioural changes
of 16.8K users affected by a major moderation intervention on Reddit. To reach
this goal, we frame the problem in terms of "quantification", a task
well-suited to estimating shifts in aggregate user behaviour. We then apply a
greedy feature selection strategy with the double goal of (i) identifying the
features that are most predictive of changes in user activity, toxicity, and
participation diversity, and (ii) estimating their importance. Our results
allow identifying a small set of features that are consistently informative
across all tasks, and determining that many others are either task-specific or
of limited utility altogether. We also find that predictive performance varies
according to the task, with changes in activity and toxicity being easier to
estimate than changes in diversity. Overall, our results pave the way for the
development of accurate systems that predict user reactions to moderation
interventions. Furthermore, our findings highlight the complexity of
post-moderation user behaviour, and indicate that effective moderation should
be tailored not only to user traits but also to the specific objective of the
intervention.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 探索LLM在生成社会研究数据时的统计代表性，评估算法偏见是否超过真实世界抽样中的偏见，包括人口统计和响应偏见。

Method: 比较四个国家（英国、阿根廷、美国和中国）的六种LLM（开放和封闭权重各半）生成的社会价值观数据与真实人类调查数据。

Result: 尽管人类调查存在后勤和财务限制，但即使是小的、有偏差的真实受访者样本，也可能比LLM产生的合成数据提供更可靠的见解。

Conclusion: 使用AI生成文本进行社会研究存在局限性，继续收集实证人类数据仍然至关重要。

Abstract: Large Language Models are being used in conversational agents that simulate
human conversations and generate social studies data. While concerns about the
models' biases have been raised and discussed in the literature, much about the
data generated is still unknown. In this study we explore the statistical
representation of social values across four countries (UK, Argentina, USA and
China) for six LLMs, with equal representation for open and closed weights. By
comparing machine-generated outputs with actual human survey data, we assess
whether algorithmic biases in LLMs outweigh the biases inherent in real- world
sampling, including demographic and response biases. Our findings suggest that,
despite the logistical and financial constraints of human surveys, even a
small, skewed sample of real respondents may provide more reliable insights
than synthetic data produced by LLMs. These results highlight the limitations
of using AI-generated text for social research and emphasize the continued
importance of empirical human data collection.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前AI评估方法难以应对日益复杂的AI系统在高风险领域的应用，需要新的方法来填补责任缺口，确保AI危害被充分理解和安全漏洞得到缓解。

Method: 采用合作式公共AI红队演练方法，结合CAMLIS 2024进行现场演示，并参考NIST ARIA试点和新加坡IMDA的类似演练经验。

Conclusion: 合作式公共AI红队演练是填补AI责任缺口的有效方法，具有实际应用价值和广泛推广潜力。

Abstract: AI systems have the potential to produce both benefits and harms, but without
rigorous and ongoing adversarial evaluation, AI actors will struggle to assess
the breadth and magnitude of the AI risk surface. Researchers from the field of
systems design have developed several effective sociotechnical AI evaluation
and red teaming techniques targeting bias, hate speech, mis/disinformation, and
other documented harm classes. However, as increasingly sophisticated AI
systems are released into high-stakes sectors (such as education, healthcare,
and intelligence-gathering), our current evaluation and monitoring methods are
proving less and less capable of delivering effective oversight.
  In order to actually deliver responsible AI and to ensure AI's harms are
fully understood and its security vulnerabilities mitigated, pioneering new
approaches to close this "responsibility gap" are now more urgent than ever. In
this paper, we propose one such approach, the cooperative public AI red-teaming
exercise, and discuss early results of its prior pilot implementations. This
approach is intertwined with CAMLIS itself: the first in-person public
demonstrator exercise was held in conjunction with CAMLIS 2024. We review the
operational design and results of this exercise, the prior National Institute
of Standards and Technology (NIST)'s Assessing the Risks and Impacts of AI
(ARIA) pilot exercise, and another similar exercise conducted with the
Singapore Infocomm Media Development Authority (IMDA). Ultimately, we argue
that this approach is both capable of delivering meaningful results and is also
scalable to many AI developing jurisdictions.

Motivation: 解决移动边缘计算中终端设备计算能力有限的问题，通过多无人机协作处理复杂任务，优化任务完成延迟和能耗之间的权衡。

Method: 使用有向无环图建模子任务依赖关系，设计两时间尺度框架解耦子任务调度，开发PDD-SCA算法将MINLP问题转化为连续形式并分解为三个嵌套子问题求解。

Conclusion: 提出的多无人机协作MEC框架和PDD-SCA算法能够有效优化系统性能，实现延迟和能耗的良好平衡，为分布式计算提供高效解决方案。

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel multi-unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) assisted
collaborative mobile edge computing (MEC) framework, where the computing tasks
of terminal devices (TDs) can be decomposed into serial or parallel sub-tasks
and offloaded to collaborative UAVs. We first model the dependencies among all
sub-tasks as a directed acyclic graph (DAG) and design a two-timescale frame
structure to decouple the sub-task interdependencies for sub-task scheduling.
Then, a joint sub-task offloading, computational resource allocation, and UAV
trajectories optimization problem is formulated, which aims to minimize the
system cost, i.e., the weighted sum of the task completion delay and the system
energy consumption. To solve this non-convex mixed-integer nonlinear
programming (MINLP) problem, a penalty dual decomposition and successive convex
approximation (PDD-SCA) algorithm is developed. Particularly, the original
MINLP problem is equivalently transferred into a continuous form relying on PDD
theory. By decoupling the resulting problem into three nested subproblems, the
SCA method is further combined to recast the non-convex components and obtain
desirable solutions. Numerical results demonstrate that: 1) Compared to the
benchmark algorithms, the proposed scheme can significantly reduce the system
cost, and thus realize an improved trade-off between task latency and energy
consumption; 2) The proposed algorithm can achieve an efficient workload
balancing for distributed computation across multiple UAVs.

Abstract: This article presents early findings from designing, deploying and evaluating
an AI-based educational agent deployed as the primary instructor in a
graduate-level Cloud Computing course at IISc. We detail the design of a Large
Language Model (LLM)-driven Instructor Agent, and introduce a pedagogical
framework that integrates the Instructor Agent into the course workflow for
actively interacting with the students for content delivery, supplemented by
the human instructor to offer the course structure and undertake
question--answer sessions. We also propose an analytical framework that
evaluates the Agent--Student interaction transcripts using interpretable
engagement metrics of topic coverage, topic depth and turn-level elaboration.
We report early experiences on how students interact with the Agent to explore
concepts, clarify doubts and sustain inquiry-driven dialogue during live
classroom sessions. We also report preliminary analysis on our evaluation
metrics applied across two successive instructional modules that reveals
patterns of engagement evolution, transitioning from broad conceptual
exploration to deeper, focused inquiry. These demonstrate how structured
integration of conversational AI agents can foster reflective learning, offer a
reproducible methodology for studying engagement in authentic classroom
settings, and support scalable, high-quality higher education.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 将米切尔关于图像具有能动性的理论应用于当代AI图像生成工具，探索AI生成图像的内在需求和特性。

Method: 通过艺术史关于抽象本质的论述，分析多模态文本到图像模型的工作原理，揭示文本和图像在数学表示上的可互换性。

Result: 发现AI生成的图像因其抽象本质而渴望具体性和实在性，用户将文本输入转换为视觉输出的过程掩盖了这种表示回归。

Conclusion: AI生成图像的内在需求是具体化，因为它们在根本上具有抽象性，文本到图像的转换过程造成了形式转换的错觉。

Abstract: W.J.T. Mitchell's influential essay 'What do pictures want?' shifts the
theoretical focus away from the interpretative act of understanding pictures
and from the motivations of the humans who create them to the possibility that
the picture itself is an entity with agency and wants. In this article, I
reframe Mitchell's question in light of contemporary AI image generation tools
to ask: what do AI-generated images want? Drawing from art historical discourse
on the nature of abstraction, I argue that AI-generated images want specificity
and concreteness because they are fundamentally abstract. Multimodal
text-to-image models, which are the primary subject of this article, are based
on the premise that text and image are interchangeable or exchangeable tokens
and that there is a commensurability between them, at least as represented
mathematically in data. The user pipeline that sees textual input become visual
output, however, obscures this representational regress and makes it seem like
one form transforms into the other -- as if by magic.

<details>

Conclusion: 需要建立治理和工程机制来缓解黑箱吸收风险，保护创新生态系统的长期可持续性，确保创作者权益得到保障。

Abstract: Large Language Models are increasingly adopted as critical tools for
accelerating innovation. This paper identifies and formalizes a systemic risk
inherent in this paradigm: \textbf{Black Box Absorption}. We define this as the
process by which the opaque internal architectures of LLM platforms, often
operated by large-scale service providers, can internalize, generalize, and
repurpose novel concepts contributed by users during interaction. This
mechanism threatens to undermine the foundational principles of innovation
economics by creating severe informational and structural asymmetries between
individual creators and platform operators, thereby jeopardizing the long-term
sustainability of the innovation ecosystem. To analyze this challenge, we
introduce two core concepts: the idea unit, representing the transportable
functional logic of an innovation, and idea safety, a multidimensional standard
for its protection. This paper analyzes the mechanisms of absorption and
proposes a concrete governance and engineering agenda to mitigate these risks,
ensuring that creator contributions remain traceable, controllable, and
equitable.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 社交媒体平台的内容创作者收入主要取决于推荐系统分配的观看量和粉丝数，现有研究表明高质量内容不一定获得相应回报，需要寻找针对性解决方案来确保收入分配的公平性。

Method: 使用理论分析和合成数据集模拟，研究有序成对比较方法如何克服新项目冷启动问题，并在MovieLens数据集上测试该干预措施的有效性。

Result: 有序成对比较显著提高了所有内容创作者获得公平结果的机会，同时保持了用户满意度。在平台早期部署时效果最好，但随着现有偏见强度增加，效果会减弱。

Conclusion: 有序成对比较方法为新平台和现有平台提供了一个可行的替代方案，可以在改善创作者公平性的同时维持平台性能。

Abstract: Social media platforms provide millions of professional content creators with
sustainable incomes. Their income is largely influenced by their number of
views and followers, which in turn depends on the platform's recommender system
(RS). So, as with regular jobs, it is important to ensure that RSs distribute
revenue in a fair way. For example, prior work analyzed whether the creators of
the highest-quality content would receive the most followers and income.
Results showed this is unlikely to be the case, but did not suggest targeted
solutions. In this work, we first use theoretical analysis and simulations on
synthetic datasets to understand the system better and find interventions that
improve fairness for creators. We find that the use of ordered pairwise
comparison overcomes the cold start problem for a new set of items and greatly
increases the chance of achieving fair outcomes for all content creators.
Importantly, it also maintains user satisfaction. We also test the intervention
on the MovieLens dataset and investigate its effectiveness on platforms with
interaction histories that are currently unfair for content creators. These
experiments reveal that the intervention improves fairness when deployed at
early stages of the platform, but the effect decreases as the strength of
pre-existing bias increases. Altogether, we find that the ordered pairwise
comparison approach might offer a plausible alternative for both new and
existing platforms to implement.
