Abstract: We present CageDroneRF (CDRF), a large-scale benchmark for Radio-Frequency (RF) drone detection and identification built from real-world captures and systematically generated synthetic variants. CDRF addresses the scarcity and limited diversity of existing RF datasets by coupling extensive raw recordings with a principled augmentation pipeline that (i) precisely controls Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR), (ii) injects interfering emitters, and (iii) applies frequency shifts with label-consistent bounding-box transformations for detection. This dataset spans a wide range of contemporary drone models, many unavailable in current public datasets, and acquisition conditions, derived from data collected at the Rowan University campus and within a controlled RF-cage facility. CDRF is released with interoperable open-source tools for data generation, preprocessing, augmentation, and evaluation that also operate on existing public benchmarks. CDRF enables standardized benchmarking for classification, open-set recognition, and object detection, supporting rigorous comparisons and reproducible pipelines. By releasing this comprehensive benchmark and tooling, CDRF aims to accelerate progress toward robust, generalizable RF perception models.

### [3] [Mass Concept Erasure in Diffusion Models with Concept Hierarchy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03305)
*Jiahang Tu,Ye Li,Yiming Wu,Hanbin Zhao,Chao Zhang,Hui Qian*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出基于超类型-子类型概念层次结构的群体概念消除方法，通过SuPLoRA技术保护超类型生成质量，构建跨领域概念消除基准


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有扩散模型概念消除方法在消除多个概念时效率低下且效果不佳，每个概念需要单独微调参数，随着消除概念数量增加会降低整体生成质量

Method: 提出超类型-子类型概念层次结构，将语义相关概念分组为超类型（如鸟类）和子类型（如金刚鹦鹉、秃鹰）；引入群体抑制方法，共享可学习参数联合消除相关概念；提出SuPLoRA技术，将超类型概念信息编码在冻结的下投影矩阵中，仅更新上投影矩阵以保护超类型生成质量

Result: 理论分析证明SuPLoRA能有效缓解生成性能退化；构建了包含名人、物体和色情内容等跨领域概念的同时消除基准，更具挑战性

Conclusion: 提出的超类型-子类型层次结构和SuPLoRA方法能有效且高效地消除多个概念，同时保护相关超类型的生成能力，解决了现有方法在多概念消除时的效率和效果问题

Abstract: The success of diffusion models has raised concerns about the generation of unsafe or harmful content, prompting concept erasure approaches that fine-tune modules to suppress specific concepts while preserving general generative capabilities. However, as the number of erased concepts grows, these methods often become inefficient and ineffective, since each concept requires a separate set of fine-tuned parameters and may degrade the overall generation quality. In this work, we propose a supertype-subtype concept hierarchy that organizes erased concepts into a parent-child structure. Each erased concept is treated as a child node, and semantically related concepts (e.g., macaw, and bald eagle) are grouped under a shared parent node, referred to as a supertype concept (e.g., bird). Rather than erasing concepts individually, we introduce an effective and efficient group-wise suppression method, where semantically similar concepts are grouped and erased jointly by sharing a single set of learnable parameters. During the erasure phase, standard diffusion regularization is applied to preserve denoising process in unmasked regions. To mitigate the degradation of supertype generation caused by excessive erasure of semantically related subtypes, we propose a novel method called Supertype-Preserving Low-Rank Adaptation (SuPLoRA), which encodes the supertype concept information in the frozen down-projection matrix and updates only the up-projection matrix during erasure. Theoretical analysis demonstrates the effectiveness of SuPLoRA in mitigating generation performance degradation. We construct a more challenging benchmark that requires simultaneous erasure of concepts across diverse domains, including celebrities, objects, and pornographic content.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 本文研究了视觉语言模型（VLM）的选择和能力如何影响下游视觉语言动作（VLA）策略的性能，发现VLM的通用能力并不能很好地预测其在具体控制任务中的表现，视觉模块是主要性能瓶颈。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究VLA模型中VLM的选择和能力如何转化为下游VLA策略性能，这是一个基础但很少被系统研究的问题。当前假设认为VLM的通用能力可以直接转化为更好的控制性能，但缺乏实证验证。

Method: 提出VLM4VLA最小适应管道，仅使用少量新可学习参数将通用VLM转换为VLA策略，实现公平高效的比较。在三个基准测试的多个下游任务上进行实证研究，并分析具体体现能力的影响。

Result: 1. VLM初始化相比从头训练有持续优势，但VLM的通用能力是下游任务表现的差预测指标；2. 提升VLM在具体体现任务上的性能并不能保证更好的下游控制性能；3. 视觉模块是主要性能瓶颈，向VLM视觉编码器注入控制相关监督能带来持续增益。

Conclusion: 标准VLM能力对有效体现控制是必要但不充分的，当前VLM预训练目标与体现动作规划需求之间存在持续领域差距，视觉模块是改进的关键方向。

Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models, which integrate pretrained large Vision-Language Models (VLM) into their policy backbone, are gaining significant attention for their promising generalization capabilities. This paper revisits a fundamental yet seldom systematically studied question: how VLM choice and competence translate to downstream VLA policies performance? We introduce VLM4VLA, a minimal adaptation pipeline that converts general-purpose VLMs into VLA policies using only a small set of new learnable parameters for fair and efficient comparison. Despite its simplicity, VLM4VLA proves surprisingly competitive with more sophisticated network designs. Through extensive empirical studies on various downstream tasks across three benchmarks, we find that while VLM initialization offers a consistent benefit over training from scratch, a VLM's general capabilities are poor predictors of its downstream task performance. This challenges common assumptions, indicating that standard VLM competence is necessary but insufficient for effective embodied control. We further investigate the impact of specific embodied capabilities by fine-tuning VLMs on seven auxiliary embodied tasks (e.g., embodied QA, visual pointing, depth estimation). Contrary to intuition, improving a VLM's performance on specific embodied skills does not guarantee better downstream control performance. Finally, modality-level ablations identify the visual module in VLM, rather than the language component, as the primary performance bottleneck. We demonstrate that injecting control-relevant supervision into the vision encoder of the VLM yields consistent gains, even when the encoder remains frozen during downstream fine-tuning. This isolates a persistent domain gap between current VLM pretraining objectives and the requirements of embodied action-planning.

### [5] [Higher order PCA-like rotation-invariant features for detailed shape descriptors modulo rotation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03326)
*Jarek Duda*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出将PCA的协方差矩阵扩展到高阶张量（如三阶或更高阶中心矩）来描述复杂形状，通过多项式乘以高斯函数实现可解码的高精度形状描述符及其旋转不变量。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: PCA使用协方差矩阵（二阶矩）通过椭球近似形状，但实际形状通常更复杂，需要更高阶的描述符来准确捕捉形状特征。

Method: 将PCA扩展到高阶张量，如三阶中心矩p_abc=E[(x_a-E[x_a])(x_b-E[x_b])(x_c-E[x_c])]或更高阶，使用多项式乘以高斯函数的方法，生成可解码的任意高精度形状描述符及其旋转不变量。

Result: 提出了能够描述复杂形状的高阶张量方法，相比传统PCA的椭球近似，能提供更准确的形状描述，并保持旋转不变性。

Conclusion: 高阶张量扩展为形状分析提供了更强大的工具，可用于分子形状描述、旋转不变物体识别、形状相似性度量等应用，避免了昂贵的旋转优化计算。

Abstract: PCA can be used for rotation invariant features, describing a shape with its $p_{ab}=E[(x_i-E[x_a])(x_b-E[x_b])]$ covariance matrix approximating shape by ellipsoid, allowing for rotation invariants like its traces of powers. However, real shapes are usually much more complicated, hence there is proposed its extension to e.g. $p_{abc}=E[(x_a-E[x_a])(x_b-E[x_b])(x_c-E[x_c])]$ order-3 or higher tensors describing central moments, or polynomial times Gaussian allowing decodable shape descriptors of arbitrarily high accuracy, and their analogous rotation invariants. Its practical applications could be rotation-invariant features to include shape modulo rotation e.g. for molecular shape descriptors, or for up to rotation object recognition in 2D images/3D scans, or shape similarity metric allowing their inexpensive comparison (modulo rotation) without costly optimization over rotations.

Motivation: 随着视觉语言模型在多模态学习中的进步，需要评估这些模型是否真正理解处理的内容，特别是能否检测错误的推理过程并识别错误类型。

Method: 构建MMErroR基准测试，包含2,013个样本，每个样本嵌入一个连贯的推理错误，涵盖6个顶级领域和24个子领域，进行过程级、以错误为中心的评估。

Result: 评估了20个先进的视觉语言模型，即使最佳模型(Gemini-3.0-Pro)也只能在66.47%的情况下正确分类错误，表明识别错误推理具有挑战性。

Conclusion: 准确识别错误的能力为理解多模态推理模型的能力提供了有价值的见解，MMErroR基准测试揭示了当前模型在错误检测方面的局限性。

Abstract: Recent advances in Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have improved performance in multi-modal learning, raising the question of whether these models truly understand the content they process. Crucially, can VLMs detect when a reasoning process is wrong and identify its error type? To answer this, we present MMErroR, a multi-modal benchmark of 2,013 samples, each embedding a single coherent reasoning error. These samples span 24 subdomains across six top-level domains, ensuring broad coverage and taxonomic richness. Unlike existing benchmarks that focus on answer correctness, MMErroR targets a process-level, error-centric evaluation that requires models to detect incorrect reasoning and classify the error type within both visual and linguistic contexts. We evaluate 20 advanced VLMs, even the best model (Gemini-3.0-Pro) classifies the error in only 66.47\% of cases, underscoring the challenge of identifying erroneous reasoning. Furthermore, the ability to accurately identify errors offers valuable insights into the capabilities of multi-modal reasoning models. Project Page: https://mmerror-benchmark.github.io

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有高质量重光照方法需要复杂的时间复用光照采集（如OLAT），限制了应用范围。需要一种能从普通图像重建可重光照头像的通用方法。

Method: 采用两阶段设计：第一阶段在无OLAT的多视角数据集上学习平面光照3DGS头像；第二阶段在小规模OLAT数据集上学习从平面光照到基于物理的反射参数的映射。

Result: 模型能够泛化到未见过的对象，仅需单张图像即可拟合，实现高质量的新视角合成和重光照效果，媲美需要OLAT数据的方法。

Conclusion: 提出了一种通用的可重光照3D高斯人头模型，通过两阶段学习和自监督光照对齐，实现了无需复杂光照采集的高质量头像重光照。

Abstract: 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has become a standard approach to reconstruct and render photorealistic 3D head avatars. A major challenge is to relight the avatars to match any scene illumination. For high quality relighting, existing methods require subjects to be captured under complex time-multiplexed illumination, such as one-light-at-a-time (OLAT). We propose a new generalized relightable 3D Gaussian head model that can relight any subject observed in a single- or multi-view images without requiring OLAT data for that subject. Our core idea is to learn a mapping from flat-lit 3DGS avatars to corresponding relightable Gaussian parameters for that avatar. Our model consists of two stages: a first stage that models flat-lit 3DGS avatars without OLAT lighting, and a second stage that learns the mapping to physically-based reflectance parameters for high-quality relighting. This two-stage design allows us to train the first stage across diverse existing multi-view datasets without OLAT lighting ensuring cross-subject generalization, where we learn a dataset-specific lighting code for self-supervised lighting alignment. Subsequently, the second stage can be trained on a significantly smaller dataset of subjects captured under OLAT illumination. Together, this allows our method to generalize well and relight any subject from the first stage as if we had captured them under OLAT lighting. Furthermore, we can fit our model to unseen subjects from as little as a single image, allowing several applications in novel view synthesis and relighting for digital avatars.

*Sha Luo,Yogesh Prabhu,Tim Ossowski,Kaiping Chen,Junjie Hu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 论文提出了RiskCueBench视频理解基准，要求模型从早期视觉信号预测风险事件，而非使用包含事故本身的完整视频序列。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频风险评估研究通常让模型访问包含事故本身的完整视频序列，这大大降低了任务难度，无法反映真实世界条件。需要建立能更好模拟实际应用场景的基准。

Method: 引入RiskCueBench视频理解基准，对视频进行精细标注以识别风险信号片段（risk signal clip），即指示潜在安全担忧的最早时刻。

Result: 实验结果显示当前系统在解释演变情况和从早期视觉信号预测未来风险事件方面存在显著能力差距，突显了视频风险预测模型实际部署的重要挑战。

Conclusion: RiskCueBench基准揭示了现有视频风险评估方法的局限性，强调了开发能够从早期视觉线索有效预测风险事件的模型的重要性，这对实际应用中的公共安全具有重要意义。

Abstract: With the rapid growth of video centered social media, the ability to anticipate risky events from visual data is a promising direction for ensuring public safety and preventing real world accidents. Prior work has extensively studied supervised video risk assessment across domains such as driving, protests, and natural disasters. However, many existing datasets provide models with access to the full video sequence, including the accident itself, which substantially reduces the difficulty of the task. To better reflect real world conditions, we introduce a new video understanding benchmark RiskCueBench in which videos are carefully annotated to identify a risk signal clip, defined as the earliest moment that indicates a potential safety concern. Experimental results reveal a significant gap in current systems ability to interpret evolving situations and anticipate future risky events from early visual signals, highlighting important challenges for deploying video risk prediction models in practice.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的Deepfake检测架构，结合空间域和频域特征的交叉注意力以及血液检测模块，在FF++和Celeb-DF数据集上取得了优于SOTA的检测性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着AI技术的发展，Deepfake的合成和滥用威胁日益严重，为了维持数字时代的信任，需要对Deepfake进行检测和标记。

Method: 提出了一种统一架构，使用空间域和频域特征之间的交叉注意力机制，并结合血液检测模块来分类图像的真伪。

Result: 在使用Swin Transformer和BERT时，在FF++和Celeb-DF数据集上分别达到99.80%和99.88%的AUC；使用EfficientNet-B4和BERT时分别达到99.55%和99.38%的AUC，且具有良好的跨数据集泛化能力。

Conclusion: 该架构在Deepfake检测方面表现出色，不仅超越了现有最佳方法，还具有良好的泛化性能，为Deepfake检测提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: The advancements in the field of AI is increasingly giving rise to various threats. One of the most prominent of them is the synthesis and misuse of Deepfakes. To sustain trust in this digital age, detection and tagging of deepfakes is very necessary. In this paper, a novel architecture for Deepfake detection in images and videos is presented. The architecture uses cross attention between spatial and frequency domain features along with a blood detection module to classify an image as real or fake. This paper aims to develop a unified architecture and provide insights into each step. Though this approach we achieve results better than SOTA, specifically 99.80%, 99.88% AUC on FF++ and Celeb-DF upon using Swin Transformer and BERT and 99.55, 99.38 while using EfficientNet-B4 and BERT. The approach also generalizes very well achieving great cross dataset results as well.

*Ali Najar,Alireza Mirrokni,Arshia Izadyari,Sadegh Mohammadian,Amir Homayoon Sharifizade,Asal Meskin,Mobin Bagherian,Ehsaneddin Asgari*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Eye-Q是一个多语言视觉文字谜题基准测试，要求模型通过复杂推理而非表面识别来推断目标词或短语，现有视觉语言模型在该基准上表现有限，最高准确率仅60.27%。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉语言模型在标准基准测试中表现良好，但主要依赖表面识别而非深层推理。视觉文字谜题需要发现隐含视觉线索、生成和修正假设，并将感知证据映射到非字面概念，这能更好地评估复杂视觉理解能力。

Method: 提出Eye-Q多语言基准测试，包含1,343个视觉文字谜题，模型观察概念密集的场景和简短描述，需要推断特定目标词或短语。谜题故意设计为非结构化和线索隐含，包含干扰项和需要选择性注意、抽象和关联推理的上下文关系。基准涵盖英语、波斯语、阿拉伯语和跨语言谜题。

Result: 评估最先进的视觉语言模型显示存在显著性能差距，特别是在抽象和跨语言谜题上。模型在构建和搜索适当概念表示以进行灵活图像到短语推理方面存在局限性，最高准确率仅达到60.27%。

Conclusion: 视觉文字谜题作为评估复杂视觉理解的挑战性替代方案，揭示了当前视觉语言模型在需要深层推理、假设形成和修正以及跨语言理解方面的局限性，为未来模型发展提供了重要方向。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have achieved strong performance on standard vision-language benchmarks, yet often rely on surface-level recognition rather than deeper reasoning. We propose visual word puzzles as a challenging alternative, as they require discovering implicit visual cues, generating and revising hypotheses, and mapping perceptual evidence to non-literal concepts in ways that are difficult to solve via literal grounding, OCR-heavy shortcuts, or simple retrieval-style matching. We introduce Eye-Q, a multilingual benchmark designed to assess this form of complex visual understanding. Eye-Q contains 1,343 puzzles in which a model observes a conceptually dense scene with a brief description and must infer a specific target word or phrase. The puzzles are intentionally unstructured and cue-implicit, with distractors and contextual relationships that demand selective attention, abstraction, and associative inference. The benchmark spans English, Persian, Arabic, and cross-lingual puzzles. We evaluate state-of-the-art VLMs using an open-ended, human-aligned protocol that probes hypothesis formation and revision under lightweight assistance. Results reveal substantial performance gaps, especially on abstract and cross-lingual puzzles, highlighting limitations in current models' ability to construct and search over appropriate conceptual representations for flexible image-to-phrase inference; maximum accuracy reaches only 60.27%.

### [11] [GAMBIT: A Gamified Jailbreak Framework for Multimodal Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03416)

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: GAMBIT是一种新型多模态越狱框架，通过构建游戏化场景驱动模型探索和推理，有效突破推理型MLLMs的安全对齐机制，在多个主流模型上达到高攻击成功率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有对抗攻击主要增加视觉任务复杂度，未能充分利用模型自身推理激励机制，导致在推理模型（带思维链）上表现不佳。作者提出：如果模型能像人类一样思考，能否影响其认知阶段决策，使其主动完成越狱？

Method: 提出GAMBIT框架：1)分解并重组有害视觉语义；2)构建游戏化场景驱动模型探索、重构意图；3)将模型定位为游戏参与者，通过目标追求降低安全注意力；4)引导模型回答重构后的恶意查询。

Result: 在流行的推理和非推理MLLMs上广泛实验显示，GAMBIT达到高攻击成功率：Gemini 2.5 Flash 92.13%、QvQ-MAX 91.20%、GPT-4o 85.87%，显著优于基线方法。

Conclusion: 通过利用模型自身推理激励机制构建游戏化场景，GAMBIT能有效突破多模态大语言模型的安全对齐机制，特别在推理模型上表现优异，揭示了当前安全防御的脆弱性。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have become widely deployed, yet their safety alignment remains fragile under adversarial inputs. Previous work has shown that increasing inference steps can disrupt safety mechanisms and lead MLLMs to generate attacker-desired harmful content. However, most existing attacks focus on increasing the complexity of the modified visual task itself and do not explicitly leverage the model's own reasoning incentives. This leads to them underperforming on reasoning models (Models with Chain-of-Thoughts) compared to non-reasoning ones (Models without Chain-of-Thoughts). If a model can think like a human, can we influence its cognitive-stage decisions so that it proactively completes a jailbreak? To validate this idea, we propose GAMBI} (Gamified Adversarial Multimodal Breakout via Instructional Traps), a novel multimodal jailbreak framework that decomposes and reassembles harmful visual semantics, then constructs a gamified scene that drives the model to explore, reconstruct intent, and answer as part of winning the game. The resulting structured reasoning chain increases task complexity in both vision and text, positioning the model as a participant whose goal pursuit reduces safety attention and induces it to answer the reconstructed malicious query. Extensive experiments on popular reasoning and non-reasoning MLLMs demonstrate that GAMBIT achieves high Attack Success Rates (ASR), reaching 92.13% on Gemini 2.5 Flash, 91.20% on QvQ-MAX, and 85.87% on GPT-4o, significantly outperforming baselines.

### [12] [FROST-Drive: Scalable and Efficient End-to-End Driving with a Frozen Vision Encoder](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03460)
*Zeyu Dong,Yimin Zhu,Yu Wu,Yu Sun*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FROST-Drive提出了一种新的端到端自动驾驶架构，通过冻结预训练视觉语言模型的视觉编码器权重，直接利用其强大的泛化能力，而不是在驾驶数据集上进行全微调，从而在复杂场景中实现更好的泛化性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前端到端自动驾驶模型通常会在驾驶数据集上完全微调视觉编码器，这可能导致模型过度专业化于训练数据，限制了其在新颖复杂场景中的泛化能力。本文挑战了这一训练范式的必要性。

Method: 提出FROST-Drive架构：1）冻结预训练视觉语言模型的视觉编码器权重；2）结合基于transformer的多模态融合适配器；3）使用GRU-based解码器生成平滑路径点；4）引入专门优化Rater Feedback Score的自定义损失函数。

Result: 在Waymo Open E2E数据集（专门设计用于捕捉长尾场景的大规模数据集）上的实验表明，冻结编码器方法显著优于采用全微调的模型，证明了保留VLM广泛知识是更有效的策略。

Conclusion: 保留强大视觉语言模型的广泛知识比密集的领域特定适应更能实现鲁棒、可泛化的驾驶性能，这为开发能更好处理现实世界应用复杂性的视觉模型提供了新途径。

Abstract: End-to-end (E2E) models in autonomous driving aim to directly map sensor inputs to control commands, but their ability to generalize to novel and complex scenarios remains a key challenge. The common practice of fully fine-tuning the vision encoder on driving datasets potentially limits its generalization by causing the model to specialize too heavily in the training data. This work challenges the necessity of this training paradigm. We propose FROST-Drive, a novel E2E architecture designed to preserve and leverage the powerful generalization capabilities of a pretrained vision encoder from a Vision-Language Model (VLM). By keeping the encoder's weights frozen, our approach directly transfers the rich, generalized world knowledge from the VLM to the driving task. Our model architecture combines this frozen encoder with a transformer-based adapter for multimodal fusion and a GRU-based decoder for smooth waypoint generation. Furthermore, we introduce a custom loss function designed to directly optimize for Rater Feedback Score (RFS), a metric that prioritizes robust trajectory planning. We conduct extensive experiments on Waymo Open E2E Dataset, a large-scale datasets deliberately curated to capture the long-tail scenarios, demonstrating that our frozen-encoder approach significantly outperforms models that employ full fine-tuning. Our results provide substantial evidence that preserving the broad knowledge of a capable VLM is a more effective strategy for achieving robust, generalizable driving performance than intensive domain-specific adaptation. This offers a new pathway for developing vision-based models that can better handle the complexities of real-world application domains.

Abstract: Scalability and data sparsity remain critical bottlenecks for collaborative filtering on massive interaction datasets. This work investigates the latent geometry of user preferences using the MovieLens 32M dataset, implementing a high-performance, parallelized Alternating Least Squares (ALS) framework. Through extensive hyperparameter optimization, we demonstrate that constrained low-rank models significantly outperform higher dimensional counterparts in generalization, achieving an optimal balance between Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and ranking precision. We visualize the learned embedding space to reveal the unsupervised emergence of semantic genre clusters, confirming that the model captures deep structural relationships solely from interaction data. Finally, we validate the system's practical utility in a cold-start scenario, introducing a tunable scoring parameter to manage the trade-off between popularity bias and personalized affinity effectively.

Abstract: Instruction-driven image editing with unified multimodal generative models has advanced rapidly, yet their underlying visual reasoning remains limited, leading to suboptimal performance on reasoning-centric edits. Reinforcement learning (RL) has been investigated for improving the quality of image editing, but it faces three key challenges: (1) limited reasoning exploration confined to denoising stochasticity, (2) biased reward fusion, and (3) unstable VLM-based instruction rewards. In this work, we propose ThinkRL-Edit, a reasoning-centric RL framework that decouples visual reasoning from image synthesis and expands reasoning exploration beyond denoising. To the end, we introduce Chain-of-Thought (CoT)-based reasoning sampling with planning and reflection stages prior to generation in online sampling, compelling the model to explore multiple semantic hypotheses and validate their plausibility before committing to a visual outcome. To avoid the failures of weighted aggregation, we propose an unbiased chain preference grouping strategy across multiple reward dimensions. Moreover, we replace interval-based VLM scores with a binary checklist, yielding more precise, lower-variance, and interpretable rewards for complex reasoning. Experiments show our method significantly outperforms prior work on reasoning-centric image editing, producing instruction-faithful, visually coherent, and semantically grounded edits.

*Yuxuan Xia,Siheng Wang,Peng Li*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种无需训练的方法SDCD，通过引入结构打乱的对比解码来缓解大型视觉语言模型中的物体幻觉问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型视觉语言模型在物体幻觉方面存在严重问题，现有研究多关注语言先验或高层统计偏差，但忽视了视觉编码过程中的内部复杂性。研究发现视觉统计偏差（源于视觉编码器在弱结构监督下的Bag-of-Patches行为）是导致物体幻觉的重要因素。

Method: 提出Structure-Disrupted Contrastive Decoding (SDCD)方法：通过引入结构打乱的视觉视图进行对比解码，对输出分布进行校准。该方法惩罚那些在结构缺失视图中仍保持高置信度的token，从而抑制纹理驱动的偏差。

Result: 实验结果表明，SDCD在多个基准测试中显著缓解了幻觉问题，并提升了LVLMs的整体多模态能力。

Conclusion: 视觉统计偏差是导致物体幻觉的重要因素，提出的SDCD方法通过对比解码有效抑制了纹理驱动的偏差，无需额外训练即可显著改善模型性能。

Abstract: Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) demonstrate significant progress in multimodal understanding and reasoning, yet object hallucination remains a critical challenge. While existing research focuses on mitigating language priors or high-level statistical biases, they often overlook the internal complexities of the visual encoding process. We identify that visual statistical bias, arising from the inherent Bag-of-Patches behavior of Vision Encoders under weak structural supervision, acts as a contributing factor of object hallucinations. Under this bias, models prioritize local texture features within individual patches over holistic geometric structures. This tendency may induce spurious visual confidence and result in hallucinations. To address this, we introduce a training-free algorithm called Structure-Disrupted Contrastive Decoding (SDCD), which performs contrastive calibration of the output distribution by introducing a shuffled structure-disrupted view. By penalizing tokens that maintain high confidence under this structure-less view, SDCD effectively suppresses the texture-driven bias. Experimental results demonstrate that SDCD significantly mitigates hallucinations across multiple benchmarks and enhances the overall multimodal capabilities of LVLMs.

Conclusion: G2P方法通过将3D高斯溅射的外观感知属性转移到点云中，显著提升了点云语义分割的判别能力和外观一致性，为解决几何相似物体的区分问题提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Semantic segmentation on point clouds is critical for 3D scene understanding. However, sparse and irregular point distributions provide limited appearance evidence, making geometry-only features insufficient to distinguish objects with similar shapes but distinct appearances (e.g., color, texture, material). We propose Gaussian-to-Point (G2P), which transfers appearance-aware attributes from 3D Gaussian Splatting to point clouds for more discriminative and appearance-consistent segmentation. Our G2P address the misalignment between optimized Gaussians and original point geometry by establishing point-wise correspondences. By leveraging Gaussian opacity attributes, we resolve the geometric ambiguity that limits existing models. Additionally, Gaussian scale attributes enable precise boundary localization in complex 3D scenes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves superior performance on standard benchmarks and shows significant improvements on geometrically challenging classes, all without any 2D or language supervision.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PCNet提出了一种用于热成像无人机图像超分辨率的物理约束跨模态增强方法，通过跨分辨率互增强模块和热传导物理约束，解决了现有方法中高频信息丢失和物理不一致伪影的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有光学引导的热成像超分辨率方法通常压缩光学特征以匹配热成像特征维度，这会导致对超分辨率有益的高频信息丢失，并且由于忽略模态间成像物理差异而引入纹理扭曲和边缘模糊等物理不一致的伪影。

Method: 提出PCNet框架，包含：1) 跨分辨率互增强模块(CRME)，联合优化热成像超分辨率和光学到热成像模态转换，实现双向特征交互；2) 物理驱动的热传导模块(PDTM)，将二维热传导融入光学引导过程；3) 温度一致性损失函数，确保生成的热成像符合真实热辐射原理。

Conclusion: PCNet通过物理约束的跨模态增强方法，有效解决了热成像无人机图像超分辨率中的高频信息丢失和物理不一致伪影问题，实现了更鲁棒和准确的热成像超分辨率。

Abstract: Optics-guided thermal UAV image super-resolution has attracted significant research interest due to its potential in all-weather monitoring applications. However, existing methods typically compress optical features to match thermal feature dimensions for cross-modal alignment and fusion, which not only causes the loss of high-frequency information that is beneficial for thermal super-resolution, but also introduces physically inconsistent artifacts such as texture distortions and edge blurring by overlooking differences in the imaging physics between modalities. To address these challenges, we propose PCNet to achieve cross-resolution mutual enhancement between optical and thermal modalities, while physically constraining the optical guidance process via thermal conduction to enable robust thermal UAV image super-resolution. In particular, we design a Cross-Resolution Mutual Enhancement Module (CRME) to jointly optimize thermal image super-resolution and optical-to-thermal modality conversion, facilitating effective bidirectional feature interaction across resolutions while preserving high-frequency optical priors. Moreover, we propose a Physics-Driven Thermal Conduction Module (PDTM) that incorporates two-dimensional heat conduction into optical guidance, modeling spatially-varying heat conduction properties to prevent inconsistent artifacts. In addition, we introduce a temperature consistency loss that enforces regional distribution consistency and boundary gradient smoothness to ensure generated thermal images align with real-world thermal radiation principles. Extensive experiments on VGTSR2.0 and DroneVehicle datasets demonstrate that PCNet significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on both reconstruction quality and downstream tasks including semantic segmentation and object detection.

Abstract: Due to the high cost of annotating accurate pixel-level labels, semi-supervised learning has emerged as a promising approach for cloud detection. In this paper, we propose CloudMatch, a semi-supervised framework that effectively leverages unlabeled remote sensing imagery through view-consistency learning combined with scene-mixing augmentations. An observation behind CloudMatch is that cloud patterns exhibit structural diversity and contextual variability across different scenes and within the same scene category. Our key insight is that enforcing prediction consistency across diversely augmented views, incorporating both inter-scene and intra-scene mixing, enables the model to capture the structural diversity and contextual richness of cloud patterns. Specifically, CloudMatch generates one weakly augmented view along with two complementary strongly augmented views for each unlabeled image: one integrates inter-scene patches to simulate contextual variety, while the other employs intra-scene mixing to preserve semantic coherence. This approach guides pseudolabel generation and enhances generalization. Extensive experiments show that CloudMatch achieves good performance, demonstrating its capability to utilize unlabeled data efficiently and advance semi-supervised cloud detection.

TL;DR: EASLT是一个情感感知的手语翻译框架，通过专门的情感编码器捕捉面部表情的情感动态，并使用情感感知融合模块解决手语翻译中的语义歧义问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前的无标注手语翻译方法主要关注手动信号，但忽略了面部表情在语义理解中的关键作用。当不同概念具有相同的手部动作时，这种忽略会导致翻译的歧义性。

Method: 提出EASLT框架，包含专门的情感编码器捕捉连续的情感动态，并通过情感感知融合模块自适应地重新校准时空手语特征，基于情感上下文解决语义歧义。

Result: 在PHOENIX14T和CSL-Daily基准测试中，EASLT在无标注方法中取得了先进性能，分别获得BLEU-4分数26.15和22.80，以及BLEURT分数61.0和57.8。

Conclusion: 通过显式建模情感，EASLT有效地将情感语义与手动动态解耦，显著提高了翻译的准确性，证明了面部表情在手语翻译中的关键语义作用。

Abstract: Sign Language Translation (SLT) is a complex cross-modal task requiring the integration of Manual Signals (MS) and Non-Manual Signals (NMS). While recent gloss-free SLT methods have made strides in translating manual gestures, they frequently overlook the semantic criticality of facial expressions, resulting in ambiguity when distinct concepts share identical manual articulations. To address this, we present **EASLT** (**E**motion-**A**ware **S**ign **L**anguage **T**ranslation), a framework that treats facial affect not as auxiliary information, but as a robust semantic anchor. Unlike methods that relegate facial expressions to a secondary role, EASLT incorporates a dedicated emotional encoder to capture continuous affective dynamics. These representations are integrated via a novel *Emotion-Aware Fusion* (EAF) module, which adaptively recalibrates spatio-temporal sign features based on affective context to resolve semantic ambiguities. Extensive evaluations on the PHOENIX14T and CSL-Daily benchmarks demonstrate that EASLT establishes advanced performance among gloss-free methods, achieving BLEU-4 scores of 26.15 and 22.80, and BLEURT scores of 61.0 and 57.8, respectively. Ablation studies confirm that explicitly modeling emotion effectively decouples affective semantics from manual dynamics, significantly enhancing translation fidelity.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 跨模态定位使用文本和点云使机器人能够通过自然语言描述进行定位，应用于自主导航和人机交互。由于物体在文本和点云中经常重复出现，空间关系成为最具有区分性的定位线索。

Method: 提出SpatiaLoc框架，采用从粗到精的策略：粗阶段使用贝塞尔增强对象空间编码器(BEOSE)在实例层面建模空间关系，以及频率感知编码器(FAE)在全局层面生成频域空间表示；精阶段使用不确定性感知高斯精细定位器(UGFL)通过建模高斯分布回归2D位置。

Conclusion: SpatiaLoc通过强调空间关系在实例和全局层面的建模，有效解决了跨模态定位问题，在文本和点云定位任务中取得了优异性能。

Abstract: Cross-modal localization using text and point clouds enables robots to localize themselves via natural language descriptions, with applications in autonomous navigation and interaction between humans and robots. In this task, objects often recur across text and point clouds, making spatial relationships the most discriminative cues for localization. Given this characteristic, we present SpatiaLoc, a framework utilizing a coarse-to-fine strategy that emphasizes spatial relationships at both the instance and global levels. In the coarse stage, we introduce a Bezier Enhanced Object Spatial Encoder (BEOSE) that models spatial relationships at the instance level using quadratic Bezier curves. Additionally, a Frequency Aware Encoder (FAE) generates spatial representations in the frequency domain at the global level. In the fine stage, an Uncertainty Aware Gaussian Fine Localizer (UGFL) regresses 2D positions by modeling predictions as Gaussian distributions with a loss function aware of uncertainty. Extensive experiments on KITTI360Pose demonstrate that SpatiaLoc significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种基于掩码预训练模型微调（MPFT）策略的AI生成图像检测方法，通过纹理感知掩码机制迫使CLIP-ViT关注真实图像与AI生成图像之间的分布偏差，显著提升了检测的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 生成模型的快速发展提高了AI生成图像的质量，引发了关于虚假信息和公众信任的担忧。检测AI生成图像成为关键挑战，特别是在泛化到未见过的生成模型方面。现有方法使用冻结的预训练CLIP模型虽有潜力，但仅将图像编码器作为基本特征提取器，未能充分利用其潜力。

Method: 提出掩码预训练模型微调（MPFT）策略，包含纹理感知掩码（TAM）机制。在微调过程中，TAM机制会掩码包含生成模型特定模式的纹理区域，迫使CLIP-ViT关注AI生成图像与真实图像之间的"分布偏差"，从而学习检测AI生成图像的能力。

Result: 在GenImage和UniversalFakeDetect数据集上的大量实验表明，该方法仅用少量图像进行微调，就显著优于现有方法，在两个数据集上分别达到98.2%和94.6%的平均准确率。

Conclusion: 通过深入分析CLIP-ViT的特性并设计纹理感知掩码微调策略，成功提升了AI生成图像检测的泛化性能，为解决生成模型快速发展带来的虚假信息问题提供了有效方案。

Abstract: The rapid advancement of generative models has significantly enhanced the quality of AI-generated images, raising concerns about misinformation and the erosion of public trust. Detecting AI-generated images has thus become a critical challenge, particularly in terms of generalizing to unseen generative models. Existing methods using frozen pre-trained CLIP models show promise in generalization but treat the image encoder as a basic feature extractor, failing to fully exploit its potential. In this paper, we perform an in-depth analysis of the frozen CLIP image encoder (CLIP-ViT), revealing that it effectively clusters real images in a high-level, abstract feature space. However, it does not truly possess the ability to distinguish between real and AI-generated images. Based on this analysis, we propose a Masking-based Pre-trained model Fine-Tuning (MPFT) strategy, which introduces a Texture-Aware Masking (TAM) mechanism to mask textured areas containing generative model-specific patterns during fine-tuning. This approach compels CLIP-ViT to attend to the "distributional deviations"from authentic images for AI-generated image detection, thereby achieving enhanced generalization performance. Extensive experiments on the GenImage and UniversalFakeDetect datasets demonstrate that our method, fine-tuned with only a minimal number of images, significantly outperforms existing approaches, achieving up to 98.2% and 94.6% average accuracy on the two datasets, respectively.

TL;DR: 本文介绍了SiT-Bench基准测试，用于评估纯文本大语言模型的空间智能能力，发现LLMs在局部语义任务上表现良好，但在全局一致性上存在"空间鸿沟"，显式空间推理能显著提升性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前空间智能研究主要依赖视觉语言模型，但空间理解究竟来自视觉编码器还是基础推理架构尚不明确。为了探究大语言模型本身的空间推理能力，需要设计一个不依赖像素输入的评估基准。

Method: 开发了SiT-Bench基准测试，包含3,800多个专家标注项目，涵盖5个主要类别和17个子任务。通过将单/多视角场景转换为高保真、坐标感知的文本描述，让LLMs进行符号文本推理而非视觉模式匹配。

Result: 评估结果显示，最先进的LLMs在局部语义任务上表现熟练，但在全局一致性方面存在显著的"空间鸿沟"。值得注意的是，显式空间推理能显著提升性能，表明LLMs具有潜在的世界建模能力。

Conclusion: SiT-Bench作为基础资源，将促进未来视觉语言模型和具身智能体所需的空间基础LLM架构的发展。研究结果表明LLMs具有空间推理的潜力，但需要进一步开发其世界建模能力。

Abstract: Recent advancements in Spatial Intelligence (SI) have predominantly relied on Vision-Language Models (VLMs), yet a critical question remains: does spatial understanding originate from visual encoders or the fundamental reasoning backbone? Inspired by this question, we introduce SiT-Bench, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate the SI performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) without pixel-level input, comprises over 3,800 expert-annotated items across five primary categories and 17 subtasks, ranging from egocentric navigation and perspective transformation to fine-grained robotic manipulation. By converting single/multi-view scenes into high-fidelity, coordinate-aware textual descriptions, we challenge LLMs to perform symbolic textual reasoning rather than visual pattern matching. Evaluation results of state-of-the-art (SOTA) LLMs reveals that while models achieve proficiency in localized semantic tasks, a significant "spatial gap" remains in global consistency. Notably, we find that explicit spatial reasoning significantly boosts performance, suggesting that LLMs possess latent world-modeling potential. Our proposed dataset SiT-Bench serves as a foundational resource to foster the development of spatially-grounded LLM backbones for future VLMs and embodied agents. Our code and benchmark will be released at https://github.com/binisalegend/SiT-Bench .

Abstract: Few-shot segmentation (FSS) aims to rapidly learn novel class concepts from limited examples to segment specific targets in unseen images, and has been widely applied in areas such as medical diagnosis and industrial inspection. However, existing studies largely overlook the complex environmental factors encountered in real world scenarios-such as illumination, background, and camera viewpoint-which can substantially increase the difficulty of test images. As a result, models trained under laboratory conditions often fall short of practical deployment requirements. To bridge this gap, in this paper, an environment-robust FSS setting is introduced that explicitly incorporates challenging test cases arising from complex environments-such as motion blur, small objects, and camouflaged targets-to enhance model's robustness under realistic, dynamic conditions. An environment robust FSS benchmark (ER-FSS) is established, covering eight datasets across multiple real world scenarios. In addition, an Adaptive Attention Distillation (AAD) method is proposed, which repeatedly contrasts and distills key shared semantics between known (support) and unknown (query) images to derive class-specific attention for novel categories. This strengthens the model's ability to focus on the correct targets in complex environments, thereby improving environmental robustness. Comparative experiments show that AAD improves mIoU by 3.3% - 8.5% across all datasets and settings, demonstrating superior performance and strong generalization.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 石刻铭文图像由于字符与背景对比度差、表面退化不均匀、存在干扰伪影以及文本密度和布局变化大，现有二值化技术经常失败，难以分离出连贯的字符区域

Method: 提出鲁棒自适应分块策略，通过动态采样和分块选择方法训练注意力U-Net进行二值化；注意力机制使模型能关注细微结构线索，同时克服表面噪声和布局不规则性

Result: 新型分块机制显著提升了二值化性能，尽管仅在单一印度脚本数据集上训练，模型展现出对其他印度和非印度脚本的强零样本泛化能力

Conclusion: 该方法为下游任务如脚本识别、OCR和历史文本分析提供了干净、结构化的铭文内容表示，展示了鲁棒性和脚本无关的泛化能力

Abstract: Binarization is a popular first step towards text extraction in historical artifacts. Stone inscription images pose severe challenges for binarization due to poor contrast between etched characters and the stone background, non-uniform surface degradation, distracting artifacts, and highly variable text density and layouts. These conditions frequently cause existing binarization techniques to fail and struggle to isolate coherent character regions. Many approaches sub-divide the image into patches to improve text fragment resolution and improve binarization performance. With this in mind, we present a robust and adaptive patching strategy to binarize challenging Indic inscriptions. The patches from our approach are used to train an Attention U-Net for binarization. The attention mechanism allows the model to focus on subtle structural cues, while our dynamic sampling and patch selection method ensures that the model learns to overcome surface noise and layout irregularities. We also introduce a carefully annotated, pixel-precise dataset of Indic stone inscriptions at the character-fragment level. We demonstrate that our novel patching mechanism significantly boosts binarization performance across classical and deep learning baselines. Despite training only on single script Indic dataset, our model exhibits strong zero-shot generalization to other Indic and non-indic scripts, highlighting its robustness and script-agnostic generalization capabilities. By producing clean, structured representations of inscription content, our method lays the foundation for downstream tasks such as script identification, OCR, and historical text analysis.

Motivation: 现有基于描述性特征的物体分类技术依赖对象对齐来计算相似度，这限制了方法的适用性和效率

Method: 将物体边界归一化并分割为近似凸段，按长度降序排序，提取段长度、极值点数量、面积、基部和宽度等特征袋来度量边界相似度

Result: 在多个数据集上测试，获得了可接受的结果

Conclusion: 提出的特征排序方法成功替代了对象对齐需求，为物体分类提供了一种有效的替代方案

Abstract: The existing object classification techniques based on descriptive features rely on object alignment to compute the similarity of objects for classification. This paper replaces the necessity of object alignment through sorting of feature. The object boundary is normalized and segmented into approximately convex segments and the segments are then sorted in descending order of their length. The segment length, number of extreme points in segments, area of segments, the base and the width of the segments - a bag of features - is used to measure the similarity between image boundaries. The proposed method is tested on datasets and acceptable results are observed.

Motivation: 雷达回波序列的准确高分辨率降水临近预报对灾害缓解和经济规划至关重要，但面临多尺度演化建模、帧间特征错位校正、长程时空上下文高效捕获等挑战。

Abstract: Accurate and high-resolution precipitation nowcasting from radar echo sequences is crucial for disaster mitigation and economic planning, yet it remains a significant challenge. Key difficulties include modeling complex multi-scale evolution, correcting inter-frame feature misalignment caused by displacement, and efficiently capturing long-range spatiotemporal context without sacrificing spatial fidelity. To address these issues, we present the Multi-scale Feature Communication Rectified Flow (RF) Network (MFC-RFNet), a generative framework that integrates multi-scale communication with guided feature fusion. To enhance multi-scale fusion while retaining fine detail, a Wavelet-Guided Skip Connection (WGSC) preserves high-frequency components, and a Feature Communication Module (FCM) promotes bidirectional cross-scale interaction. To correct inter-frame displacement, a Condition-Guided Spatial Transform Fusion (CGSTF) learns spatial transforms from conditioning echoes to align shallow features. The backbone adopts rectified flow training to learn near-linear probability-flow trajectories, enabling few-step sampling with stable fidelity. Additionally, lightweight Vision-RWKV (RWKV) blocks are placed at the encoder tail, the bottleneck, and the first decoder layer to capture long-range spatiotemporal dependencies at low spatial resolutions with moderate compute. Evaluations on four public datasets (SEVIR, MeteoNet, Shanghai, and CIKM) demonstrate consistent improvements over strong baselines, yielding clearer echo morphology at higher rain-rate thresholds and sustained skill at longer lead times. These results suggest that the proposed synergy of RF training with scale-aware communication, spatial alignment, and frequency-aware fusion presents an effective and robust approach for radar-based nowcasting.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CrackSegFlow是一个可控的流匹配合成框架，通过生成逼真的裂缝图像和掩码来解决裂缝分割中数据稀缺和域偏移问题，显著提升分割性能并发布大规模数据集。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 裂缝自动分割对于大规模基础设施状况评估至关重要，但实际部署受到像素级标签稀缺以及传感器、光照、纹理和标注规范之间的严重域偏移的限制。

Method: 提出CrackSegFlow框架：1) 使用拓扑保持掩码注入和边界门控调制生成逼真裂缝图像；2) 类条件流匹配模型合成裂缝掩码，控制裂缝覆盖率；3) 将裂缝掩码注入无裂缝背景以增强多样性并减少误报。

Result: 在五个基准测试中，域内性能平均提升5.37 mIoU和5.13 F1；目标引导跨域合成平均提升13.12 mIoU和14.82 F1。相比基于扩散的方法，提供更快的确定性采样和更好的薄结构几何对齐。

Conclusion: CrackSegFlow通过可控合成有效解决了裂缝分割中的数据稀缺和域偏移问题，显著提升了分割性能，并发布了包含5万对图像-掩码的CSF-50K数据集供大规模基准测试。

Abstract: Automated crack segmentation is essential for scalable condition assessment of pavements and civil infrastructure, yet practical deployment is limited by scarce pixel-level labels and severe domain shift across sensors, illumination, textures, and annotation conventions. This paper presents CrackSegFlow, a controllable flow-matching synthesis framework that generates photorealistic crack images conditioned on binary masks while preserving strict mask-image alignment. The generator combines topology-preserving mask injection with boundary-gated modulation to maintain thin-structure continuity and suppress texture-driven false positives. A second class-conditional flow-matching model synthesizes crack masks with explicit control over crack coverage, enabling balanced, topology-diverse paired data without additional manual annotation. We further inject crack masks into crack-free backgrounds to diversify illumination and surface artifacts and reduce false positives caused by shadows, joints, and pavement markings. Experiments on five benchmarks spanning four asphalt datasets and the crack class of a concrete-domain dataset demonstrate consistent improvements under an established hybrid CNN--Transformer segmentation backbone and a fixed training protocol. With real plus synthesized pairs, in-domain performance improves on average by 5.37 mIoU and 5.13 F1, and target-guided cross-domain synthesis yields average gains of 13.12 mIoU and 14.82 F1 using only limited target mask statistics. Compared with diffusion-based semantic synthesis, CrackSegFlow provides substantially faster deterministic sampling and improves fidelity and mask-image alignment for thin-structure crack geometry. Finally, we release CSF-50K, a public dataset of 50,000 paired crack images and pixel-accurate masks for large-scale benchmarking of generalizable crack segmentation.

TL;DR: VideoMemory是一个实体中心的视频生成框架，通过动态记忆库解决多镜头叙事视频中角色、道具和环境一致性的挑战。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频生成模型能产生高质量短片，但在场景变化或实体长时间间隔后重新出现时，难以保持实体身份和外观的一致性，这是叙事视频生成的核心挑战。

Method: 采用实体中心框架，结合动态记忆库。多智能体系统将叙事分解为镜头，从记忆库检索实体表示，基于检索状态合成关键帧和视频。动态记忆库存储角色、道具和背景的显式视觉和语义描述符，并在每个镜头后更新以反映故事驱动的变化。

Conclusion: VideoMemory通过动态记忆库的检索-更新机制，能够在远距离镜头间保持实体一致性，支持连贯的长格式视频生成，解决了叙事视频生成中的核心挑战。

Abstract: Maintaining consistent characters, props, and environments across multiple shots is a central challenge in narrative video generation. Existing models can produce high-quality short clips but often fail to preserve entity identity and appearance when scenes change or when entities reappear after long temporal gaps. We present VideoMemory, an entity-centric framework that integrates narrative planning with visual generation through a Dynamic Memory Bank. Given a structured script, a multi-agent system decomposes the narrative into shots, retrieves entity representations from memory, and synthesizes keyframes and videos conditioned on these retrieved states. The Dynamic Memory Bank stores explicit visual and semantic descriptors for characters, props, and backgrounds, and is updated after each shot to reflect story-driven changes while preserving identity. This retrieval-update mechanism enables consistent portrayal of entities across distant shots and supports coherent long-form generation. To evaluate this setting, we construct a 54-case multi-shot consistency benchmark covering character-, prop-, and background-persistent scenarios. Extensive experiments show that VideoMemory achieves strong entity-level coherence and high perceptual quality across diverse narrative sequences.

Abstract: Point cloud completion aims to recover complete 3D geometry from partial observations caused by limited viewpoints and occlusions. Existing learning-based works, including 3D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based, point-based, and Transformer-based methods, have achieved strong performance on synthetic benchmarks. However, due to the limitations of modality, scalability, and generative capacity, their generalization to novel objects and real-world scenarios remains challenging. In this paper, we propose MGPC, a generalizable multimodal point cloud completion framework that integrates point clouds, RGB images, and text within a unified architecture. MGPC introduces an innovative modality dropout strategy, a Transformer-based fusion module, and a novel progressive generator to improve robustness, scalability, and geometric modeling capability. We further develop an automatic data generation pipeline and construct MGPC-1M, a large-scale benchmark with over 1,000 categories and one million training pairs. Extensive experiments on MGPC-1M and in-the-wild data demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms prior baselines and exhibits strong generalization under real-world conditions.

TL;DR: 提出一种利用2D点轨迹作为额外运动线索的自我中心动作识别新方法，通过跟踪随机采样的图像点来提升识别精度，无需检测手部、物体或交互区域。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有自我中心动作识别方法主要依赖RGB外观、人体姿态估计或其组合，缺乏有效的运动信息表示。本研究旨在探索2D点轨迹作为轻量级运动线索的潜力，以提升动作识别性能。

Method: 使用CoTracker跟踪每个视频中随机初始化的点集，将得到的轨迹与对应图像帧一起作为Transformer识别模型的输入。方法不检测手部、物体或交互区域，仅利用点轨迹作为运动信息。

Result: 实验结果表明，整合2D点轨迹相比不使用运动信息的相同模型能持续提升性能。令人惊讶的是，即使只提供初始帧及其关联的点轨迹（不包含完整视频序列），也能获得显著增益。

Conclusion: 2D点轨迹作为轻量级但有效的运动表示，在自我中心动作理解中具有重要潜力，为动作识别提供了新的运动线索来源。

Abstract: We present a novel approach for egocentric action recognition that leverages 2D point tracks as an additional motion cue. While most existing methods rely on RGB appearance, human pose estimation, or their combination, our work demonstrates that tracking randomly sampled image points across video frames can substantially improve recognition accuracy. Unlike prior approaches, we do not detect hands, objects, or interaction regions. Instead, we employ CoTracker to follow a set of randomly initialized points through each video and use the resulting trajectories, together with the corresponding image frames, as input to a Transformer-based recognition model. Surprisingly, our method achieves notable gains even when only the initial frame and its associated point tracks are provided, without incorporating the full video sequence. Experimental results confirm that integrating 2D point tracks consistently enhances performance compared to the same model trained without motion information, highlighting their potential as a lightweight yet effective representation for egocentric action understanding.

  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决将视觉语言模型应用于内窥镜6-DoF相机定位面临的三大挑战：缺乏大规模高质量标注的医学定位数据集、细粒度位姿回归能力有限、以及提取时序特征时计算延迟高。

Method: 1) 构建了BREATH数据集，是目前最大的体内内窥镜定位数据集；2) 提出BREATH-VL混合框架，整合VLM的语义线索和视觉配准方法的几何信息；3) 引入轻量级上下文学习机制，将运动历史编码为语言提示以实现高效时序推理。

Result: 实验表明视觉语言模块在挑战性手术场景中提供鲁棒的语义定位。BREATH-VL在精度和泛化性上均优于最先进的纯视觉定位方法，平移误差比最佳基线减少25.5%，同时保持竞争力的计算延迟。

Conclusion: 通过结合视觉语言模型的语义理解能力和视觉配准的几何精度，BREATH-VL框架有效解决了内窥镜6-DoF定位的挑战，在复杂医学环境中实现了更准确、更鲁棒的定位性能。

Abstract: Vision-language models (VLMs) have recently shown remarkable performance in navigation and localization tasks by leveraging large-scale pretraining for semantic understanding. However, applying VLMs to 6-DoF endoscopic camera localization presents several challenges: 1) the lack of large-scale, high-quality, densely annotated, and localization-oriented vision-language datasets in real-world medical settings; 2) limited capability for fine-grained pose regression; and 3) high computational latency when extracting temporal features from past frames. To address these issues, we first construct BREATH dataset, the largest in-vivo endoscopic localization dataset to date, collected in the complex human airway. Building on this dataset, we propose BREATH-VL, a hybrid framework that integrates semantic cues from VLMs with geometric information from vision-based registration methods for accurate 6-DoF pose estimation. Our motivation lies in the complementary strengths of both approaches: VLMs offer generalizable semantic understanding, while registration methods provide precise geometric alignment. To further enhance the VLM's ability to capture temporal context, we introduce a lightweight context-learning mechanism that encodes motion history as linguistic prompts, enabling efficient temporal reasoning without expensive video-level computation. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the vision-language module delivers robust semantic localization in challenging surgical scenes. Building on this, our BREATH-VL outperforms state-of-the-art vision-only localization methods in both accuracy and generalization, reducing translational error by 25.5% compared with the best-performing baseline, while achieving competitive computational latency.

Abstract: Active Alignment (AA) is a key technology for the large-scale automated assembly of high-precision optical systems. Compared with labor-intensive per-model on-device calibration, a digital-twin pipeline built on optical simulation offers a substantial advantage in generating large-scale labeled data. However, complex imaging conditions induce a domain gap between simulation and real-world images, limiting the generalization of simulation-trained models. To address this, we propose augmenting a simulation baseline with minimal unlabeled real-world images captured at random misalignment positions, mitigating the gap from a domain adaptation perspective. We introduce Domain Adaptive Active Alignment (DA3), which utilizes an autoregressive domain transformation generator and an adversarial-based feature alignment strategy to distill real-world domain information via self-supervised learning. This enables the extraction of domain-invariant image degradation features to facilitate robust misalignment prediction. Experiments on two lens types reveal that DA3 improves accuracy by 46% over a purely simulation pipeline. Notably, it approaches the performance achieved with precisely labeled real-world data collected on 3 lens samples, while reducing on-device data collection time by 98.7%. The results demonstrate that domain adaptation effectively endows simulation-trained models with robust real-world performance, validating the digital-twin pipeline as a practical solution to significantly enhance the efficiency of large-scale optical assembly.

Abstract: Fine-grained classification of marine animals supports ecology, biodiversity and habitat conservation, and evidence-based policy-making. However, existing methods often overlook contextual interactions from the surrounding environment and insufficiently incorporate the hierarchical structure of marine biological taxonomy. To address these challenges, we propose MATANet (Multi-context Attention and Taxonomy-Aware Network), a novel model designed for fine-grained marine species classification. MATANet mimics expert strategies by using taxonomy and environmental context to interpret ambiguous features of underwater animals. It consists of two key components: a Multi-Context Environmental Attention Module (MCEAM), which learns relationships between regions of interest (ROIs) and their surrounding environments, and a Hierarchical Separation-Induced Learning Module (HSLM), which encodes taxonomic hierarchy into the feature space. MATANet combines instance and environmental features with taxonomic structure to enhance fine-grained classification. Experiments on the FathomNet2025, FAIR1M, and LifeCLEF2015-Fish datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance.

Abstract: Understanding how two radiology image sets differ is critical for generating clinical insights and for interpreting medical AI systems. We introduce RadDiff, a multimodal agentic system that performs radiologist-style comparative reasoning to describe clinically meaningful differences between paired radiology studies. RadDiff builds on a proposer-ranker framework from VisDiff, and incorporates four innovations inspired by real diagnostic workflows: (1) medical knowledge injection through domain-adapted vision-language models; (2) multimodal reasoning that integrates images with their clinical reports; (3) iterative hypothesis refinement across multiple reasoning rounds; and (4) targeted visual search that localizes and zooms in on salient regions to capture subtle findings. To evaluate RadDiff, we construct RadDiffBench, a challenging benchmark comprising 57 expert-validated radiology study pairs with ground-truth difference descriptions. On RadDiffBench, RadDiff achieves 47% accuracy, and 50% accuracy when guided by ground-truth reports, significantly outperforming the general-domain VisDiff baseline. We further demonstrate RadDiff's versatility across diverse clinical tasks, including COVID-19 phenotype comparison, racial subgroup analysis, and discovery of survival-related imaging features. Together, RadDiff and RadDiffBench provide the first method-and-benchmark foundation for systematically uncovering meaningful differences in radiological data.

Abstract: RGB-based camouflaged object detection struggles in real-world scenarios where color and texture cues are ambiguous. While hyperspectral image offers a powerful alternative by capturing fine-grained spectral signatures, progress in hyperspectral camouflaged object detection (HCOD) has been critically hampered by the absence of a dedicated, large-scale benchmark. To spur innovation, we introduce HyperCOD, the first challenging benchmark for HCOD. Comprising 350 high-resolution hyperspectral images, It features complex real-world scenarios with minimal objects, intricate shapes, severe occlusions, and dynamic lighting to challenge current models. The advent of foundation models like the Segment Anything Model (SAM) presents a compelling opportunity. To adapt the Segment Anything Model (SAM) for HCOD, we propose HyperSpectral Camouflage-aware SAM (HSC-SAM). HSC-SAM ingeniously reformulates the hyperspectral image by decoupling it into a spatial map fed to SAM's image encoder and a spectral saliency map that serves as an adaptive prompt. This translation effectively bridges the modality gap. Extensive experiments show that HSC-SAM sets a new state-of-the-art on HyperCOD and generalizes robustly to other public HSI datasets. The HyperCOD dataset and our HSC-SAM baseline provide a robust foundation to foster future research in this emerging area.

Motivation: 现有的基于强化学习的视频大语言模型后训练范式主要针对整体内容理解（如字幕生成或视频问答），缺乏对内在时序一致性和帧间相关性的显式监督，限制了模型捕捉复杂动态和细粒度视觉因果关系的能力。

Method: 提出Masked Video Prediction (MVP)后训练目标：要求模型从一组具有挑战性的干扰项中重建被掩码的连续视频片段，迫使模型关注事件的序列逻辑和时序上下文。开发可扩展的数据合成管道，将任意视频语料库转换为MVP训练样本，并采用带有细粒度奖励函数的Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO)来增强模型对视频上下文和时序属性的理解。

Conclusion: MVP作为一种新颖的后训练目标，能够有效增强视频大语言模型对时序逻辑和因果关系的理解，弥补了现有方法在显式时序监督方面的不足。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning based post-training paradigms for Video Large Language Models (VideoLLMs) have achieved significant success by optimizing for visual-semantic tasks such as captioning or VideoQA. However, while these approaches effectively enhance perception abilities, they primarily target holistic content understanding, often lacking explicit supervision for intrinsic temporal coherence and inter-frame correlations. This tendency limits the models' ability to capture intricate dynamics and fine-grained visual causality. To explicitly bridge this gap, we propose a novel post-training objective: Masked Video Prediction (MVP). By requiring the model to reconstruct a masked continuous segment from a set of challenging distractors, MVP forces the model to attend to the sequential logic and temporal context of events. To support scalable training, we introduce a scalable data synthesis pipeline capable of transforming arbitrary video corpora into MVP training samples, and further employ Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with a fine-grained reward function to enhance the model's understanding of video context and temporal properties. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that MVP enhances video reasoning capabilities by directly reinforcing temporal reasoning and causal understanding.

Abstract: In the manufacturing industry, computer vision systems based on artificial intelligence (AI) are widely used to reduce costs and increase production. Training these AI models requires a large amount of training data that is costly to acquire and annotate, especially in high-variance, low-volume manufacturing environments. A popular approach to reduce the need for real data is the use of synthetic data that is generated by leveraging computer-aided design (CAD) models available in the industry. However, in the agricultural industry these models are not readily available, increasing the difficulty in leveraging synthetic data. In this paper, we present different techniques for substituting CAD files to create synthetic datasets. We measure their relative performance when used to train an AI object detection model to separate stones and potatoes in a bin picking environment. We demonstrate that using highly representative 3D models acquired by scanning or using image-to-3D approaches can be used to generate synthetic data for training object detection models. Finetuning on a small real dataset can significantly improve the performance of the models and even get similar performance when less representative models are used.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have achieved notable performance in code synthesis; however, data-aware augmentation remains a limiting factor, handled via heuristic design or brute-force approaches. We introduce a performance-aware, closed-loop solution in the NNGPT ecosystem of projects that enables LLMs to autonomously engineer optimal transformations by internalizing empirical performance cues. We fine-tune LLMs with Low-Rank Adaptation on a novel repository of more than 6,000 empirically evaluated PyTorch augmentation functions, each annotated solely by downstream model accuracy. Training uses pairwise performance ordering (better-worse transformations), enabling alignment through empirical feedback without reinforcement learning, reward models, or symbolic objectives. This reduces the need for exhaustive search, achieving up to 600x times fewer evaluated candidates than brute-force discovery while maintaining competitive peak accuracy and shifting generation from random synthesis to task-aligned design. Ablation studies show that structured Chain-of-Thought prompting introduces syntactic noise and degrades performance, whereas direct prompting ensures stable optimization in performance-critical code tasks. Qualitative and quantitative analyses demonstrate that the model internalizes semantic performance cues rather than memorizing syntax. These results show that LLMs can exhibit task-level reasoning through non-textual feedback loops, bypassing explicit symbolic rewards.

Abstract: Developing foundation models in medical imaging requires continuous monitoring of downstream performance. Researchers are burdened with tracking numerous experiments, design choices, and their effects on performance, often relying on ad-hoc, manual workflows that are inherently slow and error-prone. We introduce EvalBlocks, a modular, plug-and-play framework for efficient evaluation of foundation models during development. Built on Snakemake, EvalBlocks supports seamless integration of new datasets, foundation models, aggregation methods, and evaluation strategies. All experiments and results are tracked centrally and are reproducible with a single command, while efficient caching and parallel execution enable scalable use on shared compute infrastructure. Demonstrated on five state-of-the-art foundation models and three medical imaging classification tasks, EvalBlocks streamlines model evaluation, enabling researchers to iterate faster and focus on model innovation rather than evaluation logistics. The framework is released as open source software at https://github.com/DIAGNijmegen/eval-blocks.

TL;DR: MDENeRF：通过NeRF不确定性迭代优化单目深度估计，融合单目全局结构和NeRF高频细节


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前单目深度估计方法通常产生平滑的深度图，缺乏精确场景理解所需的精细几何细节，限制了在自动驾驶导航和扩展现实等领域的应用效果。

Method: 提出MDENeRF迭代框架，包含三个组件：1）用于全局结构的初始单目估计；2）在扰动视点上训练的带有逐像素不确定性的NeRF；3）贝叶斯融合噪声单目深度和NeRF深度。从体渲染过程中推导NeRF不确定性来迭代注入高频细节。

Result: 在SUN RGB-D数据集的室内场景实验中，在关键指标上展示了优越性能。

Conclusion: MDENeRF通过融合单目深度估计的全局结构和NeRF的高频细节，能够生成更精确、细节更丰富的深度图，提升场景理解能力。

Abstract: Monocular depth estimation has applications in many fields, such as autonomous navigation and extended reality, making it an essential computer vision task. However, current methods often produce smooth depth maps that lack the fine geometric detail needed for accurate scene understanding. We propose MDENeRF, an iterative framework that refines monocular depth estimates using depth information from Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs). MDENeRF consists of three components: (1) an initial monocular estimate for global structure, (2) a NeRF trained on perturbed viewpoints, with per-pixel uncertainty, and (3) Bayesian fusion of the noisy monocular and NeRF depths. We derive NeRF uncertainty from the volume rendering process to iteratively inject high-frequency fine details. Meanwhile, our monocular prior maintains global structure. We demonstrate superior performance on key metrics and experiments using indoor scenes from the SUN RGB-D dataset.

Method: 提出FLNet深度学习架构，采用超分辨率技术将Sentinel-2卫星图像的10米空间分辨率提升至3米，然后进行损害分类。

Result: 在Bihar Flood Impacted Croplands Dataset (BFCD-22)上测试，关键"完全损害"类别的F1分数从0.83提升至0.89，接近商业高分辨率影像的0.89分数。

Conclusion: FLNet提供了成本效益高且可扩展的解决方案，为实现从人工到自动化、高保真度损害评估的全国性转变铺平了道路。

Abstract: Distributing government relief efforts after a flood is challenging. In India, the crops are widely affected by floods; therefore, making rapid and accurate crop damage assessment is crucial for effective post-disaster agricultural management. Traditional manual surveys are slow and biased, while current satellite-based methods face challenges like cloud cover and low spatial resolution. Therefore, to bridge this gap, this paper introduced FLNet, a novel deep learning based architecture that used super-resolution to enhance the 10 m spatial resolution of Sentinel-2 satellite images into 3 m resolution before classifying damage. We tested our model on the Bihar Flood Impacted Croplands Dataset (BFCD-22), and the results showed an improved critical "Full Damage" F1-score from 0.83 to 0.89, nearly matching the 0.89 score of commercial high-resolution imagery. This work presented a cost-effective and scalable solution, paving the way for a nationwide shift from manual to automated, high-fidelity damage assessment.

### [44] [FocusUI: Efficient UI Grounding via Position-Preserving Visual Token Selection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03928)
*Mingyu Ouyang,Kevin Qinghong Lin,Mike Zheng Shou,Hwee Tou Ng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: FocusUI提出了一种高效的UI grounding框架，通过选择与指令最相关的视觉补丁并保持位置连续性，显著减少了视觉token数量，在保持性能的同时提升了推理速度和降低了内存消耗。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前视觉语言模型在UI grounding任务中需要处理高分辨率截图，产生数千个视觉token，导致计算开销大且注意力稀释。而人类与UI交互时通常只关注感兴趣区域，因此需要一种更高效的UI grounding方法。

Method: FocusUI框架包含两个关键技术：1) 通过融合指令条件分数和基于规则的UI图分数来构建补丁级监督，选择独特且与指令相关的视觉token；2) 引入PosPad策略，将连续丢弃的视觉token序列压缩为单个特殊标记，放置在序列的最后一个索引位置，以保持位置连续性。

Result: 在四个grounding基准测试中，FocusUI超越了GUI特定基线。在ScreenSpot-Pro基准上，FocusUI-7B比GUI-Actor-7B性能提升3.7%。即使只保留30%的视觉token，性能仅下降3.2%，同时实现1.44倍推理加速和17%的GPU峰值内存降低。

Conclusion: FocusUI通过选择性视觉token保留和位置连续性保持，实现了高效的UI grounding，在显著减少计算开销的同时保持了良好的性能，为解决UI grounding任务中的效率问题提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown remarkable performance in User Interface (UI) grounding tasks, driven by their ability to process increasingly high-resolution screenshots. However, screenshots are tokenized into thousands of visual tokens (e.g., about 4700 for 2K resolution), incurring significant computational overhead and diluting attention. In contrast, humans typically focus on regions of interest when interacting with UI. In this work, we pioneer the task of efficient UI grounding. Guided by practical analysis of the task's characteristics and challenges, we propose FocusUI, an efficient UI grounding framework that selects patches most relevant to the instruction while preserving positional continuity for precise grounding. FocusUI addresses two key challenges: (1) Eliminating redundant tokens in visual encoding. We construct patch-level supervision by fusing an instruction-conditioned score with a rule-based UI-graph score that down-weights large homogeneous regions to select distinct and instruction-relevant visual tokens. (2) Preserving positional continuity during visual token selection. We find that general visual token pruning methods suffer from severe accuracy degradation on UI grounding tasks due to broken positional information. We introduce a novel PosPad strategy, which compresses each contiguous sequence of dropped visual tokens into a single special marker placed at the sequence's last index to preserve positional continuity. Comprehensive experiments on four grounding benchmarks demonstrate that FocusUI surpasses GUI-specific baselines. On the ScreenSpot-Pro benchmark, FocusUI-7B achieves a performance improvement of 3.7% over GUI-Actor-7B. Even with only 30% visual token retention, FocusUI-7B drops by only 3.2% while achieving up to 1.44x faster inference and 17% lower peak GPU memory.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了FUSION，首个基于扩散模型的无条件全身运动先验，联合建模身体和手部运动，解决了现有方法忽略手部运动或只在受限场景下生成全身运动的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手部在交互和手势表达中至关重要，但现有运动合成方法要么完全忽略手部运动，要么只在高度受限的狭窄任务中生成全身运动。主要障碍是缺乏大规模数据集来联合捕捉多样化的全身运动和详细的手部关节。

Method: 1. 整理和统一现有的手部运动数据集与大规模身体运动数据，生成包含手部和身体的全身序列；2. 提出首个基于扩散模型的无条件全身运动先验FUSION，联合建模身体和手部运动；3. 开发优化流程，通过精炼扩散模型的潜在空间来生成特定任务运动。

Result: 1. 在HumanML3D数据集的关键点跟踪任务中，FUSION超越了最先进的骨骼控制模型；2. 实现了更优的运动自然度；3. 展示了两个应用：给定物体运动时生成包含手指的详细全身交互运动，以及使用LLM将自然语言提示转化为可执行运动约束的自交互运动生成。

Conclusion: FUSION能够精确控制手部运动，同时保持合理的全身协调性，为全身运动合成提供了有效的解决方案。代码将公开。

Abstract: Hands are central to interacting with our surroundings and conveying gestures, making their inclusion essential for full-body motion synthesis. Despite this, existing human motion synthesis methods fall short: some ignore hand motions entirely, while others generate full-body motions only for narrowly scoped tasks under highly constrained settings. A key obstacle is the lack of large-scale datasets that jointly capture diverse full-body motion with detailed hand articulation. While some datasets capture both, they are limited in scale and diversity. Conversely, large-scale datasets typically focus either on body motion without hands or on hand motions without the body. To overcome this, we curate and unify existing hand motion datasets with large-scale body motion data to generate full-body sequences that capture both hand and body. We then propose the first diffusion-based unconditional full-body motion prior, FUSION, which jointly models body and hand motion. Despite using a pose-based motion representation, FUSION surpasses state-of-the-art skeletal control models on the Keypoint Tracking task in the HumanML3D dataset and achieves superior motion naturalness. Beyond standard benchmarks, we demonstrate that FUSION can go beyond typical uses of motion priors through two applications: (1) generating detailed full-body motion including fingers during interaction given the motion of an object, and (2) generating Self-Interaction motions using an LLM to transform natural language cues into actionable motion constraints. For these applications, we develop an optimization pipeline that refines the latent space of our diffusion model to generate task-specific motions. Experiments on these tasks highlight precise control over hand motion while maintaining plausible full-body coordination. The code will be public.

Abstract: Commercial-grade poster design demands the seamless integration of aesthetic appeal with precise, informative content delivery. Current automated poster generation systems face significant limitations, including incomplete design workflows, poor text rendering accuracy, and insufficient flexibility for commercial applications. To address these challenges, we propose PosterVerse, a full-workflow, commercial-grade poster generation method that seamlessly automates the entire design process while delivering high-density and scalable text rendering. PosterVerse replicates professional design through three key stages: (1) blueprint creation using fine-tuned LLMs to extract key design elements from user requirements, (2) graphical background generation via customized diffusion models to create visually appealing imagery, and (3) unified layout-text rendering with an MLLM-powered HTML engine to guarantee high text accuracy and flexible customization. In addition, we introduce PosterDNA, a commercial-grade, HTML-based dataset tailored for training and validating poster design models. To the best of our knowledge, PosterDNA is the first Chinese poster generation dataset to introduce HTML typography files, enabling scalable text rendering and fundamentally solving the challenges of rendering small and high-density text. Experimental results demonstrate that PosterVerse consistently produces commercial-grade posters with appealing visuals, accurate text alignment, and customizable layouts, making it a promising solution for automating commercial poster design.

Conclusion: REACT填补了生成视频评估中结构失真评估的空白，通过专门的帧级奖励模型和两阶段训练方法，为文本到视频生成提供了更全面的质量评估工具。

Abstract: Recent advances in video reward models and post-training strategies have improved text-to-video (T2V) generation. While these models typically assess visual quality, motion quality, and text alignment, they often overlook key structural distortions, such as abnormal object appearances and interactions, which can degrade the overall quality of the generative video. To address this gap, we introduce REACT, a frame-level reward model designed specifically for structural distortions evaluation in generative videos. REACT assigns point-wise scores and attribution labels by reasoning over video frames, focusing on recognizing distortions. To support this, we construct a large-scale human preference dataset, annotated based on our proposed taxonomy of structural distortions, and generate additional data using a efficient Chain-of-Thought (CoT) synthesis pipeline. REACT is trained with a two-stage framework: ((1) supervised fine-tuning with masked loss for domain knowledge injection, followed by (2) reinforcement learning with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and pairwise rewards to enhance reasoning capability and align output scores with human preferences. During inference, a dynamic sampling mechanism is introduced to focus on frames most likely to exhibit distortion. We also present REACT-Bench, a benchmark for generative video distortion evaluation. Experimental results demonstrate that REACT complements existing reward models in assessing structutal distortion, achieving both accurate quantitative evaluations and interpretable attribution analysis.

Abstract: Reliable operation of wind turbines requires frequent inspections, as even minor surface damages can degrade aerodynamic performance, reduce energy output, and accelerate blade wear. Central to automating these inspections is the accurate segmentation of turbine blades from visual data. This task is traditionally addressed through dense, pixel-wise deep learning models. However, such methods demand extensive annotated datasets, posing scalability challenges. In this work, we introduce an annotation-efficient segmentation approach that reframes the pixel-level task into a binary region classification problem. Image regions are generated using a fully unsupervised, interpretable Modular Adaptive Region Growing technique, guided by image-specific Adaptive Thresholding and enhanced by a Region Merging process that consolidates fragmented areas into coherent segments. To improve generalization and classification robustness, we introduce RegionMix, an augmentation strategy that synthesizes new training samples by combining distinct regions. Our framework demonstrates state-of-the-art segmentation accuracy and strong cross-site generalization by consistently segmenting turbine blades across distinct windfarms.

Motivation: 现有的直接偏好优化方法依赖多样本排序和特定任务的批评模型，效率低下且往往产生模糊的全局监督。需要更高效、细粒度的视频生成器对齐方法。

Method: 提出LocalDPO框架：1）自动化构建局部偏好对数据，将高质量真实视频作为正样本，通过随机时空掩码局部破坏并仅用冻结基础模型恢复掩码区域来生成负样本；2）引入区域感知DPO损失，将偏好学习限制在破坏区域以加速收敛。

Result: 在Wan2.1和CogVideoX上的实验表明，LocalDPO在视频保真度、时间连贯性和人类偏好得分方面持续优于其他后训练方法。

Conclusion: LocalDPO为视频生成器对齐建立了一个更高效和细粒度的范式，通过局部偏好优化显著提升文本到视频扩散模型的质量。

Abstract: Aligning text-to-video diffusion models with human preferences is crucial for generating high-quality videos. Existing Direct Preference Otimization (DPO) methods rely on multi-sample ranking and task-specific critic models, which is inefficient and often yields ambiguous global supervision. To address these limitations, we propose LocalDPO, a novel post-training framework that constructs localized preference pairs from real videos and optimizes alignment at the spatio-temporal region level. We design an automated pipeline to efficiently collect preference pair data that generates preference pairs with a single inference per prompt, eliminating the need for external critic models or manual annotation. Specifically, we treat high-quality real videos as positive samples and generate corresponding negatives by locally corrupting them with random spatio-temporal masks and restoring only the masked regions using the frozen base model. During training, we introduce a region-aware DPO loss that restricts preference learning to corrupted areas for rapid convergence. Experiments on Wan2.1 and CogVideoX demonstrate that LocalDPO consistently improves video fidelity, temporal coherence and human preference scores over other post-training approaches, establishing a more efficient and fine-grained paradigm for video generator alignment.

TL;DR: 本文发现大型多模态模型在视频推理中存在"文本惯性"问题：一旦思维过程中出现文本幻觉，模型会盲目遵循错误文本而忽略冲突的视觉证据，并提出训练无关的推理范式来缓解此问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型多模态模型在视频推理中展示了令人印象深刻的能力，但其推理链的鲁棒性存在问题。研究发现存在"文本惯性"这一关键失效模式，即一旦思维过程中出现文本幻觉，模型会盲目遵循错误文本而忽略冲突的视觉证据。

Method: 提出了LogicGraph扰动协议，在多种LMM的推理链中结构性地注入扰动来评估其自我反思能力。为缓解问题，提出了Active Visual-Context Refinement，这是一种训练无关的推理范式，通过主动视觉重定位机制强制细粒度验证，并结合自适应上下文精炼策略来总结和去噪推理历史。

Result: 实验结果显示，模型成功自我纠正的比例不到10%，主要受制于盲目的文本错误传播。提出的方法显著抑制了幻觉传播并增强了推理鲁棒性。

Conclusion: 大型多模态模型在视频推理中存在严重的文本惯性问题，需要专门的机制来强制视觉验证和上下文精炼，以提高推理链的鲁棒性和可靠性。

Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in video reasoning via Chain-of-Thought (CoT). However, the robustness of their reasoning chains remains questionable. In this paper, we identify a critical failure mode termed textual inertia, where once a textual hallucination occurs in the thinking process, models tend to blindly adhere to the erroneous text while neglecting conflicting visual evidence. To systematically investigate this, we propose the LogicGraph Perturbation Protocol that structurally injects perturbations into the reasoning chains of diverse LMMs spanning both native reasoning architectures and prompt-driven paradigms to evaluate their self-reflection capabilities. The results reveal that models successfully self-correct in less than 10% of cases and predominantly succumb to blind textual error propagation. To mitigate this, we introduce Active Visual-Context Refinement, a training-free inference paradigm which orchestrates an active visual re-grounding mechanism to enforce fine-grained verification coupled with an adaptive context refinement strategy to summarize and denoise the reasoning history. Experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly stifles hallucination propagation and enhances reasoning robustness.

Abstract: We present Gen3R, a method that bridges the strong priors of foundational reconstruction models and video diffusion models for scene-level 3D generation. We repurpose the VGGT reconstruction model to produce geometric latents by training an adapter on its tokens, which are regularized to align with the appearance latents of pre-trained video diffusion models. By jointly generating these disentangled yet aligned latents, Gen3R produces both RGB videos and corresponding 3D geometry, including camera poses, depth maps, and global point clouds. Experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art results in single- and multi-image conditioned 3D scene generation. Additionally, our method can enhance the robustness of reconstruction by leveraging generative priors, demonstrating the mutual benefit of tightly coupling reconstruction and generative models.

Motivation: 当前遥感视觉语言模型在复杂空间任务中存在逻辑幻觉问题，即正确答案来自错误推理链或依赖位置捷径而非空间逻辑，这种解耦现象削弱了战略空间决策的可靠性

Method: 提出GeoReason框架：1)构建GeoReason-Bench逻辑驱动数据集(4000个推理轨迹)；2)两阶段训练策略：监督知识初始化(学习推理语法和领域知识)和一致性感知强化学习(引入逻辑一致性奖励，通过选项排列策略惩罚逻辑漂移)

Conclusion: GeoReason框架通过同步内部思维与最终决策，有效解决了遥感视觉语言模型中的逻辑幻觉问题，为复杂空间任务提供了更可靠的认知推理能力

Abstract: The evolution of Remote Sensing Vision-Language Models(RS-VLMs) emphasizes the importance of transitioning from perception-centric recognition toward high-level deductive reasoning to enhance cognitive reliability in complex spatial tasks. However, current models often suffer from logical hallucinations, where correct answers are derived from flawed reasoning chains or rely on positional shortcuts rather than spatial logic. This decoupling undermines reliability in strategic spatial decision-making. To address this, we present GeoReason, a framework designed to synchronize internal thinking with final decisions. We first construct GeoReason-Bench, a logic-driven dataset containing 4,000 reasoning trajectories synthesized from geometric primitives and expert knowledge. We then formulate a two-stage training strategy: (1) Supervised Knowledge Initialization to equip the model with reasoning syntax and domain expertise, and (2) Consistency-Aware Reinforcement Learning to refine deductive reliability. This second stage integrates a novel Logical Consistency Reward, which penalizes logical drift via an option permutation strategy to anchor decisions in verifiable reasoning traces.

*Leandro Stival,Ricardo da Silva Torres,Helio Pedrini*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出了一种新颖的多模态方法，利用像素级二维表示更有效地编码卫星图像时间序列中的视觉属性变化，通过对比学习提升表示质量，在多个地球观测任务中优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 卫星持续产生海量数据，特别是地球观测数据，包括卫星图像时间序列。然而，大多数深度学习模型要么处理整个图像，要么处理完整的时间序列序列来提取下游任务的特征。需要更有效的方法来处理像素级的时间序列数据。

Method: 提出了一种多模态方法：1) 从基于像素的植被指数时间序列（NDVI、EVI、SAVI）生成递归图作为原始像素值的替代，创建更具信息性的表示；2) 引入PIxel-wise Multimodal Contrastive (PIMC)，一种新的多模态自监督方法，基于二维像素时间序列表示和遥感图像产生有效的编码器。

Result: 实验结果表明：1) 使用二维表示显著增强了从卫星图像时间序列中提取特征的能力；2) 对比学习提高了像素时间序列和遥感图像表示的质量；3) 在PASTIS数据集上的像素级预测和分类任务，以及EuroSAT数据集上的土地覆盖分类任务中，该方法优于最先进的方法。

Conclusion: 该多模态方法在各种地球观测任务中优于现有模型，建立了一个强大的自监督框架，用于处理卫星图像时间序列和遥感图像，为地球观测任务提供了更有效的特征提取方法。

Abstract: Satellites continuously generate massive volumes of data, particularly for Earth observation, including satellite image time series (SITS). However, most deep learning models are designed to process either entire images or complete time series sequences to extract meaningful features for downstream tasks. In this study, we propose a novel multimodal approach that leverages pixel-wise two-dimensional (2D) representations to encode visual property variations from SITS more effectively. Specifically, we generate recurrence plots from pixel-based vegetation index time series (NDVI, EVI, and SAVI) as an alternative to using raw pixel values, creating more informative representations. Additionally, we introduce PIxel-wise Multimodal Contrastive (PIMC), a new multimodal self-supervision approach that produces effective encoders based on two-dimensional pixel time series representations and remote sensing imagery (RSI). To validate our approach, we assess its performance on three downstream tasks: pixel-level forecasting and classification using the PASTIS dataset, and land cover classification on the EuroSAT dataset. Moreover, we compare our results to state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on all downstream tasks. Our experimental results show that the use of 2D representations significantly enhances feature extraction from SITS, while contrastive learning improves the quality of representations for both pixel time series and RSI. These findings suggest that our multimodal method outperforms existing models in various Earth observation tasks, establishing it as a robust self-supervision framework for processing both SITS and RSI.

*Jun Wang,Chunyu Qiang,Yuxin Guo,Yiran Wang,Xijuan Zeng,Chen Zhang,Pengfei Wan*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Klear是一个音频-视频联合生成系统，通过单塔架构、渐进式多任务训练策略和首个大规模密集标注数据集，解决了现有方法中的音频-视觉异步、唇语对齐差和模态退化问题，在联合和单模态生成任务上均表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有音频-视频联合生成方法存在三个主要问题：音频-视觉异步、唇语-语音对齐差、单模态退化。这些问题源于音频-视觉对应建模弱、泛化能力有限以及高质量密集标注数据稀缺。

Method: 从三个维度解决问题：1) 架构：采用单塔设计，统一DiT块和Omni-Full Attention机制；2) 训练策略：渐进式多任务训练，包括随机模态掩码、跨任务联合优化和多阶段课程学习；3) 数据：构建首个大规模音频-视频密集标注数据集，开发自动化数据构建流水线。

Result: Klear在多个任务上大幅超越先前方法，实现了高保真、语义和时间对齐的指令跟随生成，在联合和单模态设置中均表现优异，并能鲁棒地泛化到分布外场景，性能可与Veo 3相媲美。

Conclusion: Klear通过创新的架构设计、训练策略和数据构建，为下一代音频-视频合成提供了一个统一且可扩展的路径，解决了现有方法的核心瓶颈问题。

Abstract: Audio-video joint generation has progressed rapidly, yet substantial challenges still remain. Non-commercial approaches still suffer audio-visual asynchrony, poor lip-speech alignment, and unimodal degradation, which can be stemmed from weak audio-visual correspondence modeling, limited generalization, and scarce high-quality dense-caption data. To address these issues, we introduce Klear and delve into three axes--model architecture, training strategy, and data curation. Architecturally, we adopt a single-tower design with unified DiT blocks and an Omni-Full Attention mechanism, achieving tight audio-visual alignment and strong scalability. Training-wise, we adopt a progressive multitask regime--random modality masking to joint optimization across tasks, and a multistage curriculum, yielding robust representations, strengthening A-V aligned world knowledge, and preventing unimodal collapse. For datasets, we present the first large-scale audio-video dataset with dense captions, and introduce a novel automated data-construction pipeline which annotates and filters millions of diverse, high-quality, strictly aligned audio-video-caption triplets. Building on this, Klear scales to large datasets, delivering high-fidelity, semantically and temporally aligned, instruction-following generation in both joint and unimodal settings while generalizing robustly to out-of-distribution scenarios. Across tasks, it substantially outperforms prior methods by a large margin and achieves performance comparable to Veo 3, offering a unified, scalable path toward next-generation audio-video synthesis.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Diffusion-DRF：一种使用冻结视觉语言模型作为训练免费批评者的可微分奖励流方法，用于微调视频扩散模型，无需额外奖励模型或偏好数据集


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于DPO的文本到视频生成方法依赖不可微分的偏好信号（人类标注或学习到的奖励模型），导致训练标签密集、易产生偏见、容易被游戏化，常引发奖励黑客攻击和不稳定训练

Method: 提出Diffusion-DRF方法：1）使用冻结的现成视觉语言模型作为训练免费批评者；2）通过扩散去噪链直接反向传播VLM反馈；3）将logit级响应转换为token感知梯度进行优化；4）提出自动化、方面结构化的提示管道获取可靠的多维VLM反馈；5）使用梯度检查点实现高效更新

Result: Diffusion-DRF提高了视频质量和语义对齐，同时减轻了奖励黑客攻击和崩溃问题，无需额外奖励模型或偏好数据集。该方法具有模型无关性，可轻松推广到其他基于扩散的生成任务

Conclusion: Diffusion-DRF提供了一种可微分、高效的替代方案，通过利用现成VLM的反馈直接优化视频扩散模型，避免了传统DPO方法的标签密集和稳定性问题

Abstract: Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has recently improved Text-to-Video (T2V) generation by enhancing visual fidelity and text alignment. However, current methods rely on non-differentiable preference signals from human annotations or learned reward models. This reliance makes training label-intensive, bias-prone, and easy-to-game, which often triggers reward hacking and unstable training. We propose Diffusion-DRF, a differentiable reward flow for fine-tuning video diffusion models using a frozen, off-the-shelf Vision-Language Model (VLM) as a training-free critic. Diffusion-DRF directly backpropagates VLM feedback through the diffusion denoising chain, converting logit-level responses into token-aware gradients for optimization. We propose an automated, aspect-structured prompting pipeline to obtain reliable multi-dimensional VLM feedback, while gradient checkpointing enables efficient updates through the final denoising steps. Diffusion-DRF improves video quality and semantic alignment while mitigating reward hacking and collapse -- without additional reward models or preference datasets. It is model-agnostic and readily generalizes to other diffusion-based generative tasks.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: ToTMNet：一种轻量级远程光电容积脉搏波（rPPG）架构，使用FFT加速的Toeplitz时间混合层替代注意力机制，在保持高精度心率估计的同时大幅减少参数和计算成本。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有深度rPPG模型虽然提高了鲁棒性，但计算成本和参数数量增加，基于注意力的时间建模存在时间长度二次方扩展问题，需要更高效的架构。

Method: 提出ToTMNet，使用FFT加速的Toeplitz时间混合层替代注意力机制，通过循环嵌入和FFT卷积实现近线性时间计算，结合局部深度时间卷积分支和门控全局Toeplitz混合。

Result: 在UBFC-rPPG数据集上达到1.055 bpm MAE和0.996 Pearson相关系数；在合成到真实场景（SCAMPS到UBFC-rPPG）达到1.582 bpm MAE和0.994相关系数；仅需63k参数。

Conclusion: Toeplitz结构时间混合是rPPG中注意力机制的高效实用替代方案，门控机制对有效利用全局Toeplitz混合（特别是在域转移下）至关重要。

Abstract: Remote photoplethysmography (rPPG) estimates a blood volume pulse (BVP) waveform from facial videos captured by commodity cameras. Although recent deep models improve robustness compared to classical signal-processing approaches, many methods increase computational cost and parameter count, and attention-based temporal modeling introduces quadratic scaling with respect to the temporal length. This paper proposes ToTMNet, a lightweight rPPG architecture that replaces temporal attention with an FFT-accelerated Toeplitz temporal mixing layer. The Toeplitz operator provides full-sequence temporal receptive field using a linear number of parameters in the clip length and can be applied in near-linear time using circulant embedding and FFT-based convolution. ToTMNet integrates the global Toeplitz temporal operator into a compact gated temporal mixer that combines a local depthwise temporal convolution branch with gated global Toeplitz mixing, enabling efficient long-range temporal filtering while only having 63k parameters. Experiments on two datasets, UBFC-rPPG (real videos) and SCAMPS (synthetic videos), show that ToTMNet achieves strong heart-rate estimation accuracy with a compact design. On UBFC-rPPG intra-dataset evaluation, ToTMNet reaches 1.055 bpm MAE with Pearson correlation 0.996. In a synthetic-to-real setting (SCAMPS to UBFC-rPPG), ToTMNet reaches 1.582 bpm MAE with Pearson correlation 0.994. Ablation results confirm that the gating mechanism is important for effectively using global Toeplitz mixing, especially under domain shift. The main limitation of this preprint study is the use of only two datasets; nevertheless, the results indicate that Toeplitz-structured temporal mixing is a practical and efficient alternative to attention for rPPG.

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种结合2D图像和深度图的视觉定位方法，通过增强图像表示来提升几何推理能力，在保持易构建维护的同时达到高精度。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉定位方法存在两难：2D图像方法易于构建和维护但几何推理能力有限；3D结构方法精度高但需要集中式重建且难以更新。需要一种既能保持2D方法优势又能提升几何推理能力的新方法。

Method: 采用2D图像为基础表示，为每张图像添加估计的深度图来捕获几何结构。利用密集匹配器，结合紧凑压缩和GPU加速的LO-RANSAC实现，在存储和计算上都很高效。

Result: 该方法在各种标准基准测试中达到了新的最先进精度，在可比地图大小下优于现有的内存高效方法，实现了精度与内存效率的灵活权衡。

Conclusion: 通过增强2D图像表示，该方法在保持易构建维护优势的同时，显著提升了视觉定位的精度和几何推理能力，为实际应用提供了高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Existing visual localization methods are typically either 2D image-based, which are easy to build and maintain but limited in effective geometric reasoning, or 3D structure-based, which achieve high accuracy but require a centralized reconstruction and are difficult to update. In this work, we revisit visual localization with a 2D image-based representation and propose to augment each image with estimated depth maps to capture the geometric structure. Supported by the effective use of dense matchers, this representation is not only easy to build and maintain, but achieves highest accuracy in challenging conditions. With compact compression and a GPU-accelerated LO-RANSAC implementation, the whole pipeline is efficient in both storage and computation and allows for a flexible trade-off between accuracy and highest memory efficiency. Our method achieves a new state-of-the-art accuracy on various standard benchmarks and outperforms existing memory-efficient methods at comparable map sizes.

TL;DR: CHORD是一个通用的生成式管道，用于合成动态物体和场景的4D运动，通过从2D视频中提取拉格朗日运动信息，实现类别无关的动态生成。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统基于规则的图形管道创建动态场景需要类别特定的启发式方法，劳动密集且不可扩展；基于学习的方法通常需要大规模数据集，但可能无法覆盖所有感兴趣的物体类别。需要一种通用、可扩展的方法来生成4D场景动态。

Method: 提出基于蒸馏的管道，从2D视频的欧拉表示中提取隐藏的拉格朗日运动信息，继承视频生成模型的通用性。该方法具有通用性、多功能性和类别无关性。

Result: 实验表明该方法能生成多样化的多体4D动态，相比现有方法具有优势，并展示了在生成机器人操作策略方面的适用性。

Conclusion: CHORD提供了一个通用、可扩展的解决方案，用于合成4D场景动态，克服了传统方法和现有学习方法的局限性，在动态场景生成和机器人应用方面具有潜力。

Abstract: Dynamic objects in our physical 4D (3D + time) world are constantly evolving, deforming, and interacting with other objects, leading to diverse 4D scene dynamics. In this paper, we present a universal generative pipeline, CHORD, for CHOReographing Dynamic objects and scenes and synthesizing this type of phenomena. Traditional rule-based graphics pipelines to create these dynamics are based on category-specific heuristics, yet are labor-intensive and not scalable. Recent learning-based methods typically demand large-scale datasets, which may not cover all object categories in interest. Our approach instead inherits the universality from the video generative models by proposing a distillation-based pipeline to extract the rich Lagrangian motion information hidden in the Eulerian representations of 2D videos. Our method is universal, versatile, and category-agnostic. We demonstrate its effectiveness by conducting experiments to generate a diverse range of multi-body 4D dynamics, show its advantage compared to existing methods, and demonstrate its applicability in generating robotics manipulation policies.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统RAG系统面临检索召回率与LLM上下文限制的平衡问题：检索太少会丢失关键信息，检索太多会超出提示窗口限制，降低相关性并增加成本。

Method: 1. LLM驱动的查询扩展提高候选召回率；2. FlashRank重排序器基于边际效用动态选择最优证据子集，考虑相关性、新颖性、简洁性和交叉编码器证据，在token预算内优化选择。

Result: 该方法提高了答案准确性、忠实性和计算效率，形成了可推广的解决方案。

Conclusion: 提出的两阶段检索管道有效解决了RAG系统中检索召回与上下文限制的平衡问题，通过查询扩展和智能重排序优化证据选择，提升整体性能。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) couples a retriever with a large language model (LLM) to ground generated responses in external evidence. While this framework enhances factuality and domain adaptability, it faces a key bottleneck: balancing retrieval recall with limited LLM context. Retrieving too few passages risks missing critical context, while retrieving too many overwhelms the prompt window, diluting relevance and increasing cost.
  We propose a two-stage retrieval pipeline that integrates LLM-driven query expansion to improve candidate recall and FlashRank, a fast marginal-utility reranker that dynamically selects an optimal subset of evidence under a token budget. FlashRank models document utility as a weighted combination of relevance, novelty, brevity, and cross-encoder evidence. Together, these modules form a generalizable solution that increases answer accuracy, faithfulness, and computational efficiency.

TL;DR: LLMDiRec：一种将大语言模型与意图感知扩散模型结合的新推荐方法，通过动态融合ID嵌入和语义表示，显著提升对复杂用户意图的捕捉能力，特别是在新用户和长尾物品推荐方面表现优异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有序列推荐模型（包括先进的扩散模型）主要依赖ID嵌入，缺乏语义基础，难以捕捉用户行为背后的丰富语义意图，尤其在新用户和长尾物品推荐方面表现不佳。

Method: 提出LLMDiRec方法，将大语言模型集成到意图感知扩散模型中，通过动态融合机制和多任务目标，结合ID嵌入的协同信号和LLM的丰富语义表示，对齐两种视图。

Result: 在五个公开数据集上的实验表明，LLMDiRec优于现有最先进算法，在捕捉复杂用户意图和提升长尾物品推荐性能方面表现尤为突出。

Conclusion: 通过结合大语言模型的语义能力和扩散模型的协同过滤能力，LLMDiRec有效解决了现有推荐系统在语义意图理解方面的局限性，为新用户和长尾物品推荐提供了更优解决方案。

Abstract: Existing sequential recommendation models, even advanced diffusion-based approaches, often struggle to capture the rich semantic intent underlying user behavior, especially for new users or long-tail items. This limitation stems from their reliance on ID-based embeddings, which lack semantic grounding. We introduce LLMDiRec, a new approach that addresses this gap by integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) into an intent-aware diffusion model. Our approach combines collaborative signals from ID embeddings with rich semantic representations from LLMs, using a dynamic fusion mechanism and a multi-task objective to align both views. We run extensive experiments on five public datasets. We run extensive experiments on five public datasets. We demonstrate that \modelname outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms, with particularly strong improvements in capturing complex user intents and enhancing recommendation performance for long-tail items.

Motivation: 视觉丰富文档（如包含复杂布局、图表、表格的文档）给检索增强生成带来了特殊挑战，包括布局依赖的语义、脆弱的OCR识别以及跨复杂视觉元素分散的证据。需要探索多模态大语言模型如何使VRD检索变得实用。

Method: 将现有文献组织为三种角色：1）模态统一描述器 - 将视觉内容转换为文本描述；2）多模态嵌入器 - 生成联合嵌入表示；3）端到端表示器 - 直接处理多模态输入。从检索粒度、信息保真度、延迟和索引大小、与重排序和接地的兼容性等维度进行比较分析。

Result: 分析了三种角色的优缺点和适用场景，提供了关于何时优先选择每种角色的实用指导，并揭示了不同方法在检索性能、计算效率和信息保留方面的权衡。

Conclusion: 多模态大语言模型为视觉丰富文档检索提供了有前景的解决方案，但需要根据具体应用场景选择合适的角色。未来研究方向包括自适应检索单元、模型大小缩减和评估方法开发。

Abstract: Visually rich documents (VRDs) challenge retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with layout-dependent semantics, brittle OCR, and evidence spread across complex figures and structured tables. This survey examines how Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are being used to make VRD retrieval practical for RAG. We organize the literature into three roles: Modality-Unifying Captioners, Multimodal Embedders, and End-to-End Representers. We compare these roles along retrieval granularity, information fidelity, latency and index size, and compatibility with reranking and grounding. We also outline key trade-offs and offer some practical guidance on when to favor each role. Finally, we identify promising directions for future research, including adaptive retrieval units, model size reduction, and the development of evaluation methods.

Method: 将长用户交互历史压缩为可学习token，然后与近期交互结合生成推荐，这种方法可应用于现有的Transformer推荐模型

Abstract: Recent years have witnessed success of sequential modeling, generative recommender, and large language model for recommendation. Though the scaling law has been validated for sequential models, it showed inefficiency in computational capacity when considering real-world applications like recommendation, due to the non-linear(quadratic) increasing nature of the transformer model. To improve the efficiency of the sequential model, we introduced a novel approach to sequential recommendation that leverages personalization techniques to enhance efficiency and performance. Our method compresses long user interaction histories into learnable tokens, which are then combined with recent interactions to generate recommendations. This approach significantly reduces computational costs while maintaining high recommendation accuracy. Our method could be applied to existing transformer based recommendation models, e.g., HSTU and HLLM. Extensive experiments on multiple sequential models demonstrate its versatility and effectiveness.

Motivation: 航空航天行业严重依赖技术文档的搜索和重用，但目前缺乏反映该领域术语和查询意图特点的公开信息检索基准。

Method: 提出STELLA框架，通过文档布局检测、段落分块、术语词典构建、合成查询生成和跨语言扩展的系统流程，从NASA技术报告服务器文档构建航空航天特定IR评估集。

Result: 评估7个嵌入模型发现：大型解码器嵌入模型在语义理解方面表现最强，而BM25等词法匹配方法在需要精确匹配技术术语的领域仍具有高度竞争力。

Conclusion: STELLA基准为航空航天领域信息检索任务中嵌入模型的可靠性能评估和改进提供了可重复的基础。

Abstract: Tasks in the aerospace industry heavily rely on searching and reusing large volumes of technical documents, yet there is no public information retrieval (IR) benchmark that reflects the terminology- and query-intent characteristics of this domain. To address this gap, this paper proposes the STELLA (Self-Reflective TErminoLogy-Aware Framework for BuiLding an Aerospace Information Retrieval Benchmark) framework. Using this framework, we introduce the STELLA benchmark, an aerospace-specific IR evaluation set constructed from NASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS) documents via a systematic pipeline that comprises document layout detection, passage chunking, terminology dictionary construction, synthetic query generation, and cross-lingual extension. The framework generates two types of queries: the Terminology Concordant Query (TCQ), which includes the terminology verbatim to evaluate lexical matching, and the Terminology Agnostic Query (TAQ), which utilizes the terminology's description to assess semantic matching. This enables a disentangled evaluation of the lexical and semantic matching capabilities of embedding models. In addition, we combine Chain-of-Density (CoD) and the Self-Reflection method with query generation to improve quality and implement a hybrid cross-lingual extension that reflects real user querying practices. Evaluation of seven embedding models on the STELLA benchmark shows that large decoder-based embedding models exhibit the strongest semantic understanding, while lexical matching methods such as BM25 remain highly competitive in domains where exact lexical matching technical term is crucial. The STELLA benchmark provides a reproducible foundation for reliable performance evaluation and improvement of embedding models in aerospace-domain IR tasks.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于RLHF的推荐方法直接优化物品排序，可能会牺牲推荐系统的原始排序性能。需要一种方法既能生成个性化解释，又不影响推荐系统的核心排序准确性。

Method: 采用两塔架构：保持推荐排序模型不变，同时让语言模型学习生成有用解释。设计复合奖励信号（解释长度、内容相关性和连贯性），使用PPO和KL散度约束，通过LoRA适配器仅微调大语言模型0.4%的参数。

Result: 在亚马逊图书数据集（约5万次交互）上，相对点击率提升22.5%（1.225倍于基线），同时推荐系统的物品排序行为几乎保持不变。消融研究证实梯度屏蔽策略和奖励设计有效平衡了解释质量和策略漂移。

Conclusion: Shielded RecRL通过丰富的个性化解释增强了推荐系统的用户面向方面，同时不降低核心推荐准确性，实现了推荐性能与解释质量的平衡。

Abstract: We introduce Shielded RecRL, a reinforcement learning approach to generate personalized explanations for recommender systems without sacrificing the system's original ranking performance. Unlike prior RLHF-based recommender methods that directly optimize item rankings, our two-tower architecture keeps the recommender's ranking model intact while a language model learns to produce helpful explanations. We design a composite reward signal combining explanation length, content relevance, and coherence, and apply proximal policy optimization (PPO) with a KL-divergence constraint to fine-tune a large language model with only 0.4% of its parameters trainable via LoRA adapters. In experiments on an Amazon Books dataset (approximately 50K interactions in the fantasy and romance genres), Shielded RecRL improved the relative click-through rate (CTR) by 22.5% (1.225x over baseline) while keeping the recommender's item-ranking behavior virtually unchanged. An extensive ablation study confirms that our gradient shielding strategy and reward design effectively balance explanation quality and policy drift. Our results demonstrate that Shielded RecRL enhances user-facing aspects of recommendations through rich, personalized explanations without degrading core recommendation accuracy.

TL;DR: 本文提出维度事实模型（DFM）作为指导RAG系统多维分区的概念框架，将语义聚类与基于时间、组织背景等概念维度的分区相结合，使大规模检索从"黑盒"相似性匹配转变为可治理的确定性工作流。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前工业级RAG系统虽然通过水平分片、近似最近邻搜索等技术解决了可扩展性问题，但这些机制依赖于自底向上的相似性驱动组织，缺乏对语料库分区的概念性原理。现有系统中的时间、组织背景等维度虽然已隐含存在，但使用方式随意且缺乏结构化。

Method: 提出维度事实模型（DFM）作为概念框架，为RAG语料库的多维分区设计提供原则性指导。该框架支持对事实、维度、层次结构和粒度进行推理，自然支持分层路由和受控回退策略。

Result: DFM框架将检索过程从"黑盒"相似性匹配转变为可治理和确定性的工作流，即使在元数据不完整的情况下也能保持检索的鲁棒性。该框架为大规模RAG系统提供了原则性、可解释且可治理的检索策略设计基础。

Conclusion: 本文作为立场论文，旨在弥合OLAP风格的多维建模与现代RAG架构之间的差距，并激发对大规模原则性、可解释和可治理检索策略的进一步研究。DFM框架为设计更结构化和概念驱动的大规模RAG系统提供了理论基础。

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems are increasingly deployed on large-scale document collections, often comprising millions of documents and tens of millions of text chunks. In industrial-scale retrieval platforms, scalability is typically addressed through horizontal sharding and a combination of Approximate Nearest-Neighbor search, hybrid indexing, and optimized metadata filtering. Although effective from an efficiency perspective, these mechanisms rely on bottom-up, similarity-driven organization and lack a conceptual rationale for corpus partitioning. In this paper, we claim that the design of large-scale RAG systems may benefit from the combination of two orthogonal strategies: semantic clustering, which optimizes locality in embedding space, and multidimensional partitioning, which governs where retrieval should occur based on conceptual dimensions such as time and organizational context. Although such dimensions are already implicitly present in current systems, they are used in an ad hoc and poorly structured manner. We propose the Dimensional Fact Model (DFM) as a conceptual framework to guide the design of multidimensional partitions for RAG corpora. The DFM provides a principled way to reason about facts, dimensions, hierarchies, and granularity in retrieval-oriented settings. This framework naturally supports hierarchical routing and controlled fallback strategies, ensuring that retrieval remains robust even in the presence of incomplete metadata, while transforming the search process from a 'black-box' similarity matching into a governable and deterministic workflow. This work is intended as a position paper; its goal is to bridge the gap between OLAP-style multidimensional modeling and modern RAG architectures, and to stimulate further research on principled, explainable, and governable retrieval strategies at scale.

TL;DR: DiffSBR：一种基于扩散的潜在邻居生成模型，用于会话推荐，通过生成未直接观察但相关的潜在邻居来缓解数据稀疏问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有会话推荐方法主要依赖显式观察的会话数据，忽略了兴趣空间中潜在相关的邻居会话，未能充分利用邻居会话的潜力

Method: 提出DiffSBR模型，包含两个扩散模块：检索增强扩散（利用检索邻居作为指导信号）和自增强扩散（通过对比学习注入当前会话的多模态信号），生成高质量潜在邻居来增强会话表示

Result: 在四个公共数据集上的实验表明，DiffSBR能生成有效的潜在邻居，并在推荐性能上优于最先进的基线方法

Conclusion: DiffSBR通过生成潜在邻居有效缓解了数据稀疏问题，提升了会话推荐性能，证明了潜在邻居生成在推荐系统中的价值

Abstract: Session-based recommendation aims to predict the next item that anonymous users may be interested in, based on their current session interactions. Recent studies have demonstrated that retrieving neighbor sessions to augment the current session can effectively alleviate the data sparsity issue and improve recommendation performance. However, existing methods typically rely on explicitly observed session data, neglecting latent neighbors - not directly observed but potentially relevant within the interest space - thereby failing to fully exploit the potential of neighbor sessions in recommendation. To address the above limitation, we propose a novel model of diffusion-based latent neighbor generation for session-based recommendation, named DiffSBR. Specifically, DiffSBR leverages two diffusion modules, including retrieval-augmented diffusion and self-augmented diffusion, to generate high-quality latent neighbors. In the retrieval-augmented diffusion module, we leverage retrieved neighbors as guiding signals to constrain and reconstruct the distribution of latent neighbors. Meanwhile, we adopt a training strategy that enables the retriever to learn from the feedback provided by the generator. In the self-augmented diffusion module, we explicitly guide the generation of latent neighbors by injecting the current session's multi-modal signals through contrastive learning. After obtaining the generated latent neighbors, we utilize them to enhance session representations for improving session-based recommendation. Extensive experiments on four public datasets show that DiffSBR generates effective latent neighbors and improves recommendation performance against state-of-the-art baselines.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大型语言模型经常生成内容相关但不符合形式约束的输出，传统提示优化方法只关注重述主要任务描述，忽略了作为响应接受标准的细粒度约束条件。

Method: 采用多智能体工作流，将主要任务描述优化与约束条件解耦，使用量化评分作为反馈，迭代重写和改进提示，生成修订后的提示。

Result: 评估显示该方法生成的修订提示在Llama 3.1 8B和Mixtral-8x 7B等模型上获得了显著更高的遵从性评分。

Conclusion: 提出的多智能体工作流能有效提升LLM输出对形式约束的遵从性，解决了传统方法忽视细粒度约束条件的问题。

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often generate substantively relevant content but fail to adhere to formal constraints, leading to outputs that are conceptually correct but procedurally flawed. Traditional prompt refinement approaches focus on rephrasing the description of the primary task an LLM has to perform, neglecting the granular constraints that function as acceptance criteria for its response. We propose a novel multi-agentic workflow that decouples optimization of the primary task description from its constraints, using quantitative scores as feedback to iteratively rewrite and improve them. Our evaluation demonstrates this method produces revised prompts that yield significantly higher compliance scores from models like Llama 3.1 8B and Mixtral-8x 7B.

Abstract: Understanding how artificial agents model internal mental states is central to advancing Theory of Mind in AI. Evidence points to a unified system for self- and other-awareness. We explore this self-awareness by having reinforcement learning agents infer their own internal states in gridworld environments. Specifically, we introduce an introspective exploration component that is inspired by biological pain as a learning signal by utilizing a hidden Markov model to infer "pain-belief" from online observations. This signal is integrated into a subjective reward function to study how self-awareness affects the agent's learning abilities. Further, we use this computational framework to investigate the difference in performance between normal and chronic pain perception models. Results show that introspective agents in general significantly outperform standard baseline agents and can replicate complex human-like behaviors.

TL;DR: CPGPrompt：一种将临床实践指南转化为LLM自动提示的系统，通过结构化决策树实现指南导航，在专科转诊决策上表现优异，但在多类路径分类上表现有差异。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 临床实践指南（CPGs）为患者护理提供循证建议，但将其整合到人工智能中仍具挑战性。现有方法如基于规则的系统存在可解释性差、指南遵循不一致、领域适用性窄等限制。

Method: 开发CPGPrompt自动提示系统，将叙述性临床指南转化为结构化决策树，利用大语言模型动态导航这些决策树进行患者病例评估。在头痛、腰痛和前列腺癌三个领域生成合成病例，测试不同决策场景。

Result: 二元专科转诊分类在所有领域表现一致强劲（F1: 0.85-1.00），召回率高（1.00 ± 0.00）。多类路径分配表现下降，领域间有差异：头痛（F1: 0.47）、腰痛（F1: 0.72）、前列腺癌（F1: 0.77）。性能差异反映了各指南的结构特点。

Conclusion: CPGPrompt系统成功将临床指南转化为LLM可处理的格式，在二元决策任务上表现优异。多类路径分类的性能差异揭示了不同指南结构对AI系统的影响，为未来改进提供了方向。

Abstract: Clinical practice guidelines (CPGs) provide evidence-based recommendations for patient care; however, integrating them into Artificial Intelligence (AI) remains challenging. Previous approaches, such as rule-based systems, face significant limitations, including poor interpretability, inconsistent adherence to guidelines, and narrow domain applicability. To address this, we develop and validate CPGPrompt, an auto-prompting system that converts narrative clinical guidelines into large language models (LLMs).
  Our framework translates CPGs into structured decision trees and utilizes an LLM to dynamically navigate them for patient case evaluation. Synthetic vignettes were generated across three domains (headache, lower back pain, and prostate cancer) and distributed into four categories to test different decision scenarios. System performance was assessed on both binary specialty-referral decisions and fine-grained pathway-classification tasks.
  The binary specialty referral classification achieved consistently strong performance across all domains (F1: 0.85-1.00), with high recall (1.00 $\pm$ 0.00). In contrast, multi-class pathway assignment showed reduced performance, with domain-specific variations: headache (F1: 0.47), lower back pain (F1: 0.72), and prostate cancer (F1: 0.77). Domain-specific performance differences reflected the structure of each guideline. The headache guideline highlighted challenges with negation handling. The lower back pain guideline required temporal reasoning. In contrast, prostate cancer pathways benefited from quantifiable laboratory tests, resulting in more reliable decision-making.

TL;DR: 大型基础模型在医疗AI中具有潜力，但无法替代N-of-1试验。两者互补：基础模型擅长从群体数据生成假设，N-of-1试验擅长个体因果验证。提出结合两者的混合框架来解决个性化医疗中的矛盾。

Motivation: 大型基础模型在医疗AI领域展现出强大能力，但能否提供真正的个性化治疗建议仍存疑问。研究发现个性化与外部有效性存在根本矛盾（泛化悖论），同时存在隐私-性能、规模-特异性、自动化-同理心等多重悖论。需要明确预测与因果的界限，负责任地将AI整合到个性化医疗中。

Method: 提出混合框架：大型基础模型利用多模态数据从群体模式中快速生成干预候选假设并提供不确定性估计，然后触发N-of-1试验进行个体层面的因果验证。N-of-1试验作为交叉自实验，是个性化医疗中个体因果推断的金标准。

Abstract: Large foundation models (LFMs) transform healthcare AI in prevention, diagnostics, and treatment. However, whether LFMs can provide truly personalized treatment recommendations remains an open question. Recent research has revealed multiple challenges for personalization, including the fundamental generalizability paradox: models achieving high accuracy in one clinical study perform at chance level in others, demonstrating that personalization and external validity exist in tension. This exemplifies broader contradictions in AI-driven healthcare: the privacy-performance paradox, scale-specificity paradox, and the automation-empathy paradox. As another challenge, the degree of causal understanding required for personalized recommendations, as opposed to mere predictive capacities of LFMs, remains an open question. N-of-1 trials -- crossover self-experiments and the gold standard for individual causal inference in personalized medicine -- resolve these tensions by providing within-person causal evidence while preserving privacy through local experimentation. Despite their impressive capabilities, this paper argues that LFMs cannot replace N-of-1 trials. We argue that LFMs and N-of-1 trials are complementary: LFMs excel at rapid hypothesis generation from population patterns using multimodal data, while N-of-1 trials excel at causal validation for a given individual. We propose a hybrid framework that combines the strengths of both to enable personalization and navigate the identified paradoxes: LFMs generate ranked intervention candidates with uncertainty estimates, which trigger subsequent N-of-1 trials. Clarifying the boundary between prediction and causation and explicitly addressing the paradoxical tensions are essential for responsible AI integration in personalized medicine.

Result: 实验表明STAR-S能有效防御越狱攻击，性能优于基线方法

Conclusion: STAR-S框架通过自学习循环集成安全规则推理，为防御大语言模型越狱攻击提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Defending against jailbreak attacks is crucial for the safe deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs). Recent research has attempted to improve safety by training models to reason over safety rules before responding. However, a key issue lies in determining what form of safety reasoning effectively defends against jailbreak attacks, which is difficult to explicitly design or directly obtain. To address this, we propose \textbf{STAR-S} (\textbf{S}elf-\textbf{TA}ught \textbf{R}easoning based on \textbf{S}afety rules), a framework that integrates the learning of safety rule reasoning into a self-taught loop. The core of STAR-S involves eliciting reasoning and reflection guided by safety rules, then leveraging fine-tuning to enhance safety reasoning. Repeating this process creates a synergistic cycle. Improvements in the model's reasoning and interpretation of safety rules allow it to produce better reasoning data under safety rule prompts, which is then utilized for further training. Experiments show that STAR-S effectively defends against jailbreak attacks, outperforming baselines. Code is available at: https://github.com/pikepokenew/STAR_S.git.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前CoT评估方法的局限性使得难以区分性能提升是来自真正的推理能力还是仅仅来自更长的输出。需要一种非侵入性、全面的过程中心化评估框架来分析LLM的推理行为。

Method: 提出了一种神经符号框架，用于对推理过程进行非侵入性、全面的评估。通过该框架识别了四种不同的行为原型，并诊断了失败模式。研究了推理模式、训练策略和模型规模的影响。

Result: 发现扩展的token生成并非深度推理的必要条件。揭示了关键限制：训练中混合长短CoT数据可能导致过早饱和和崩溃；将知识蒸馏到小模型虽然能复制行为长度，但由于内在容量限制而无法复制逻辑效能。

Conclusion: 需要超越简单长度度量的更精细评估方法。模型规模、训练策略和推理模式对推理能力有重要影响，混合训练数据和模型蒸馏存在固有局限性。

Abstract: Test-time scaling has enabled Large Language Models (LLMs) to tackle complex reasoning, yet the limitations of current Chain-of-Thought (CoT) evaluation obscures whether performance gains stem from genuine reasoning or mere verbosity. To address this, (1) we propose a novel neuro-symbolic framework for the non-intrusive, comprehensive process-centric evaluation of reasoning. (2) Through this lens, we identify four distinct behavioral prototypes and diagnose the failure modes. (3) We examine the impact of inference mode, training strategy, and model scale. Our analysis reveals that extended token generation is not a prerequisite for deep reasoning. Furthermore, we reveal critical constraints: mixing long and short CoT data in training risks in premature saturation and collapse, while distillation into smaller models captures behavioral length but fails to replicate logical efficacy due to intrinsic capacity limits.

Motivation: 大推理模型虽然能自主选择推理策略，但这种自主选择常导致低效甚至错误的推理路径。现有方法难以控制细粒度推理策略，因为策略概念在隐藏状态中纠缠在一起。

Method: 使用稀疏自编码器将策略纠缠的隐藏状态分解为解耦的特征空间，提出SAE-Steering两阶段特征识别流程：首先通过放大策略特定关键词的logits召回特征，过滤99%以上特征，然后按控制效果对剩余特征排序。

Result: SAE-Steering使用识别出的策略特定特征作为控制向量，在控制效果上比现有方法高出15%以上。控制推理策略能将模型从错误路径重定向到正确路径，实现7%的绝对准确率提升。

Conclusion: 通过解耦隐藏状态并识别策略特定特征，可以有效地控制大推理模型的推理策略，提高推理的可靠性和灵活性，显著提升模型性能。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) exhibit human-like cognitive reasoning strategies (e.g. backtracking, cross-verification) during reasoning process, which improves their performance on complex tasks. Currently, reasoning strategies are autonomously selected by LRMs themselves. However, such autonomous selection often produces inefficient or even erroneous reasoning paths. To make reasoning more reliable and flexible, it is important to develop methods for controlling reasoning strategies. Existing methods struggle to control fine-grained reasoning strategies due to conceptual entanglement in LRMs' hidden states. To address this, we leverage Sparse Autoencoders (SAEs) to decompose strategy-entangled hidden states into a disentangled feature space. To identify the few strategy-specific features from the vast pool of SAE features, we propose SAE-Steering, an efficient two-stage feature identification pipeline. SAE-Steering first recalls features that amplify the logits of strategy-specific keywords, filtering out over 99\% of features, and then ranks the remaining features by their control effectiveness. Using the identified strategy-specific features as control vectors, SAE-Steering outperforms existing methods by over 15\% in control effectiveness. Furthermore, controlling reasoning strategies can redirect LRMs from erroneous paths to correct ones, achieving a 7\% absolute accuracy improvement.

Motivation: 大型推理模型通过显式思维步骤取得显著成功，但这些步骤可能放大不安全行为。现有防御机制忽视了LRM独特的推理动态，研究发现思维步骤中出现安全提醒短语对确保LRM安全至关重要。

Method: 提出SafeRemind解码时防御方法，利用熵触发器在决策锁定点进行干预，动态将安全提醒短语注入思维步骤，将潜在有害轨迹重定向到更安全的结果，无需参数更新。

Result: 在5个LRM和6个基准测试上的广泛评估表明，SafeRemind显著增强安全性，提升幅度高达45.5个百分点，同时保持核心推理效用。

Conclusion: SafeRemind通过动态注入安全提醒短语有效解决了LRM推理过程中的安全漏洞，在保持推理能力的同时大幅提升模型安全性，为LRM安全防御提供了新思路。

Abstract: Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) achieve remarkable success through explicit thinking steps, yet the thinking steps introduce a novel risk by potentially amplifying unsafe behaviors. Despite this vulnerability, conventional defense mechanisms remain ineffective as they overlook the unique reasoning dynamics of LRMs. In this work, we find that the emergence of safe-reminding phrases within thinking steps plays a pivotal role in ensuring LRM safety. Motivated by this finding, we propose SafeRemind, a decoding-time defense method that dynamically injects safe-reminding phrases into thinking steps. By leveraging entropy triggers to intervene at decision-locking points, SafeRemind redirects potentially harmful trajectories toward safer outcomes without requiring any parameter updates. Extensive evaluations across five LRMs and six benchmarks demonstrate that SafeRemind substantially enhances safety, achieving improvements of up to 45.5%p while preserving core reasoning utility.

Motivation: 查询修正是现代搜索管道的关键入口点，需要在实时延迟约束下保持高准确性。虽然思维链推理能提高准确性，但其延迟过高无法满足实时需求。提前输出答案虽然能降低延迟，但无法利用后续推理来改进准确性。

Method: 提出SandwichR方法，采用"答案-推理-答案"范式：先生成初始修正，然后进行显式推理过程，最后生成精炼的最终修正。设计了基于一致性的强化学习策略，包括一致性奖励来对齐初始和最终修正，以及基于边界的拒绝采样来优先处理推理带来最大修正增益的样本。

Conclusion: SandwichR通过创新的三明治推理结构，成功解决了查询修正中推理能力与实时延迟之间的矛盾，为在线搜索系统提供了既准确又高效的解决方案。

Abstract: Query correction is a critical entry point in modern search pipelines, demanding high accuracy strictly within real-time latency constraints. Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning improves accuracy but incurs prohibitive latency for real-time query correction. A potential solution is to output an answer before reasoning to reduce latency; however, under autoregressive decoding, the early answer is independent of subsequent reasoning, preventing the model from leveraging its reasoning capability to improve accuracy. To address this issue, we propose Sandwich Reasoning (SandwichR), a novel approach that explicitly aligns a fast initial answer with post-hoc reasoning, enabling low-latency query correction without sacrificing reasoning-aware accuracy. SandwichR follows an Answer-Reasoning-Answer paradigm, producing an initial correction, an explicit reasoning process, and a final refined correction. To align the initial answer with post-reasoning insights, we design a consistency-aware reinforcement learning (RL) strategy: a dedicated consistency reward enforces alignment between the initial and final corrections, while margin-based rejection sampling prioritizes borderline samples where reasoning drives the most impactful corrective gains. Additionally, we construct a high-quality query correction dataset, addressing the lack of specialized benchmarks for complex query correction. Experimental results demonstrate that SandwichR achieves SOTA accuracy comparable to standard CoT while delivering a 40-70% latency reduction, resolving the latency-accuracy trade-off in online search.

Motivation: 个性化药物规划需要为每位患者选择药物并确定给药方案以实现医疗目标。先前工作使用通用领域无关启发式方法，但实践中最多只能处理7种药物，这在临床应用中远远不够。

Method: 通过编程方式指定领域（定义初始状态和后继生成过程），使用LLM生成问题特定启发式，配合固定搜索算法（GBFS）进行药物规划。

Conclusion: 自动生成的领域和问题特定启发式方法能够显著提升药物规划的可扩展性，使其更适用于临床实践。

Abstract: Personalized medication planning involves selecting medications and determining a dosing schedule to achieve medical goals specific to each individual patient. Previous work successfully demonstrated that automated planners, using general domain-independent heuristics, are able to generate personalized treatments, when the domain and problems are modeled using a general domain description language (\pddlp). Unfortunately, this process was limited in practice to consider no more than seven medications. In clinical terms, this is a non-starter. In this paper, we explore the use of automatically-generated domain- and problem-specific heuristics to be used with general search, as a method of scaling up medication planning to levels allowing closer work with clinicians. Specifically, we specify the domain programmatically (specifying an initial state and a successor generation procedure), and use an LLM to generate a problem specific heuristic that can be used by a fixed search algorithm (GBFS). The results indicate dramatic improvements in coverage and planning time, scaling up the number of medications to at least 28, and bringing medication planning one step closer to practical applications.

Conclusion: EntroCoT能有效识别和优化低质量CoT监督轨迹，构建的高质量数据集显著提升大语言模型的数学推理能力，解决了"答案正确但推理错误"的问题。

Abstract: Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting has significantly enhanced the mathematical reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models. We find existing fine-tuning datasets frequently suffer from the "answer right but reasoning wrong" probelm, where correct final answers are derived from hallucinated, redundant, or logically invalid intermediate steps. This paper proposes EntroCoT, a unified framework for automatically identifying and refining low-quality CoT supervision traces. EntroCoT first proposes an entropy-based mechanism to segment the reasoning trace into multiple steps at uncertain junctures, and then introduces a Monte Carlo rollout-based mechanism to evaluate the marginal contribution of each step. By accurately filtering deceptive reasoning samples, EntroCoT constructs a high-quality dataset where every intermediate step in each reasoning trace facilitates the final answer. Extensive experiments on mathematical benchmarks demonstrate that fine-tuning on the subset constructed by EntroCoT consistently outperforms the baseslines of full-dataset supervision.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 大语言模型虽然具备强大的推理能力，但无法自动判断不同任务所需的计算量。在严格全局token约束下，需要让模型学会预测任务难度、估计投资回报率，并战略性地分配计算资源。

Method: 提出ROI-Reasoning两阶段框架：1) 元认知微调阶段：训练模型在生成前预测推理成本和预期效用，做出明确的解决或跳过决策；2) 理性感知强化学习阶段：在硬token预算下优化序列决策，学习长期分配策略。

Result: 在预算数学推理基准测试中，ROI-Reasoning在严格计算预算下持续提高总体得分，同时显著减少遗憾值。

Conclusion: 该研究将预算推理时间推理形式化为有序随机多选择背包问题，通过赋予LLMs内在的预算感知理性，实现了在有限计算资源下的高效推理分配。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) can achieve strong reasoning performance with sufficient computation, but they do not inherently know how much computation a task requires. We study budgeted inference-time reasoning for multiple tasks under a strict global token constraint and formalize it as a Ordered Stochastic Multiple-Choice Knapsack Problem(OS-MCKP). This perspective highlights a meta-cognitive requirement -- anticipating task difficulty, estimating return over investment (ROI), and allocating computation strategically. We propose ROI-Reasoning, a two-stage framework that endows LLMs with intrinsic, budget-aware rationality. In the first stage, Meta-Cognitive Fine-Tuning teaches models to predict reasoning cost and expected utility before generation, enabling explicit solve-or-skip decisions. Next, Rationality-Aware Reinforcement Learning optimizes sequential decision making under a hard token budget, allowing models to learn long-horizon allocation strategies. Across budgeted mathematical reasoning benchmarks, ROI-Reasoning consistently improves overall score while substantially reducing regret under tight computation budgets.

Abstract: Defeasible entailment is concerned with drawing plausible conclusions from incomplete information. A foundational framework for modelling defeasible entailment is the KLM framework. Introduced by Kraus, Lehmann, and Magidor, the KLM framework outlines several key properties for defeasible entailment. One of the most prominent algorithms within this framework is Rational Closure (RC). This paper presents a declarative definition for computing RC using Answer Set Programming (ASP). Our approach enables the automatic construction of the minimal ranked model from a given knowledge base and supports entailment checking for specified queries. We formally prove the correctness of our ASP encoding and conduct empirical evaluations to compare the performance of our implementation with that of existing imperative implementations, specifically the InfOCF solver. The results demonstrate that our ASP-based approach adheres to RC's theoretical foundations and offers improved computational efficiency.

Motivation: 开发工具支持法律专家在刑事审判阶段进行推理和预测法律结果，提高司法决策的可解释性

Method: 使用ASP编码意大利刑法典条款，包括"人身犯罪"和财产犯罪；通过归纳逻辑编程系统从案例中归纳法律规则；处理编码过程中的矛盾并生成解释

Result: 开发出能够对先前判决进行验证和优化的系统，能够为新案件生成可能的决策并提供基于稳定模型"支持性"的解释

Conclusion: ASP方法能有效建模刑法典并学习法律规则，工具提高了司法决策过程的透明度和可解释性

Abstract: We propose an approach to model articles of the Italian Criminal Code (ICC), using Answer Set Programming (ASP), and to semi-automatically learn legal rules from examples based on prior judicial decisions. The developed tool is intended to support legal experts during the criminal trial phase by providing reasoning and possible legal outcomes. The methodology involves analyzing and encoding articles of the ICC in ASP, including "crimes against the person" and property offenses. The resulting model is validated on a set of previous verdicts and refined as necessary. During the encoding process, contradictions may arise; these are properly handled by the system, which also generates possible decisions for new cases and provides explanations through a tool that leverages the "supportedness" of stable models. The automatic explainability offered by the tool can also be used to clarify the logic behind judicial decisions, making the decision-making process more interpretable. Furthermore, the tool integrates an inductive logic programming system for ASP, which is employed to generalize legal rules from case examples.

Abstract: Decision tree models, including random forests and gradient-boosted decision trees, are widely used in machine learning due to their high predictive performance.  However, their complex structures often make them difficult to interpret, especially in safety-critical applications where model decisions require formal justification.  Recent work has demonstrated that logical and abductive explanations can be derived through automated reasoning techniques.  In this paper, we propose a method for generating various types of explanations, namely, sufficient, contrastive, majority, and tree-specific explanations, using Answer Set Programming (ASP).  Compared to SAT-based approaches, our ASP-based method offers greater flexibility in encoding user preferences and supports enumeration of all possible explanations.  We empirically evaluate the approach on a diverse set of datasets and demonstrate its effectiveness and limitations compared to existing methods.

Method: 采用增量求解方法处理内存需求问题，并开发了约束感知猜测方法进一步减少内存需求，重点解决接地瓶颈问题

Result: 增量求解方法在实践中有效，但内存需求仍构成显著限制；约束感知猜测方法显著减少了内存需求，提高了ASP处理大规模配置问题的能力

Conclusion: ASP技术在大规模配置问题中具有潜力，但内存瓶颈是主要限制因素；通过增量求解和约束感知猜测等方法可以显著改善性能，但仍需进一步优化以处理超大规模配置问题

Abstract: Answer set programming (ASP) aims to realize the AI vision: The user specifies the problem, and the computer solves it. Indeed, ASP has made this vision true in many application domains. However, will current ASP solving techniques scale up for large configuration problems? As a benchmark for such problems, we investigated the configuration of electronic systems, which may comprise more than 30,000 components. We show the potential and limits of current ASP technology, focusing on methods that address the so-called grounding bottleneck, i.e., the sharp increase of memory demands in the size of the problem instances. To push the limits, we investigated the incremental solving approach, which proved effective in practice. However, even in the incremental approach, memory demands impose significant limits. Based on an analysis of grounding, we developed the method constraint-aware guessing, which significantly reduced the memory need.

TL;DR: Trade-R1框架通过过程级推理验证将可验证奖励与随机金融环境连接，解决标准强化学习在金融决策中的奖励黑客问题，使用三角一致性度量和两种奖励整合策略提升跨市场泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 强化学习在数学和编程等可验证奖励领域表现出色，但扩展到金融决策时面临市场随机性的挑战：奖励可验证但本质上是噪声的，导致标准强化学习退化为奖励黑客行为。

Method: 提出Trade-R1训练框架，通过过程级推理验证连接可验证奖励与随机环境。核心创新是将冗长金融文档的推理评估转化为结构化检索增强生成任务，构建三角一致性度量（检索证据、推理链和决策之间的两两对齐），作为噪声市场回报的有效性过滤器。探索两种奖励整合策略：固定效应语义奖励（FSR）提供稳定对齐信号，动态效应语义奖励（DSR）进行耦合幅度优化。

Result: 在不同国家资产选择实验中，该范式减少了奖励黑客行为，其中DSR实现了优越的跨市场泛化能力，同时保持了最高的推理一致性。

Conclusion: Trade-R1框架通过过程级推理验证有效解决了强化学习在随机金融环境中的奖励黑客问题，为大型语言模型在金融决策领域的应用提供了可行的解决方案。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has enabled Large Language Models (LLMs) to achieve remarkable reasoning in domains like mathematics and coding, where verifiable rewards provide clear signals. However, extending this paradigm to financial decision is challenged by the market's stochastic nature: rewards are verifiable but inherently noisy, causing standard RL to degenerate into reward hacking. To address this, we propose Trade-R1, a model training framework that bridges verifiable rewards to stochastic environments via process-level reasoning verification. Our key innovation is a verification method that transforms the problem of evaluating reasoning over lengthy financial documents into a structured Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) task. We construct a triangular consistency metric, assessing pairwise alignment between retrieved evidence, reasoning chains, and decisions to serve as a validity filter for noisy market returns. We explore two reward integration strategies: Fixed-effect Semantic Reward (FSR) for stable alignment signals, and Dynamic-effect Semantic Reward (DSR) for coupled magnitude optimization. Experiments on different country asset selection demonstrate that our paradigm reduces reward hacking, with DSR achieving superior cross-market generalization while maintaining the highest reasoning consistency.

Motivation: 现有强化学习增强的大推理模型在简单查询上存在过度冗长问题，导致部署成本高昂。现有的显式长度惩罚方法存在优化冲突，且未深入探究过度思考的生成机制

Method: 提出动态异常截断(DOT)训练时干预方法，选择性抑制冗余token；结合辅助KL正则化和预测性动态采样确保稳定收敛

Result: 在多个模型规模上显著提升了效率-性能帕累托前沿，在AIME-24上减少78%推理token使用，同时提高准确率，超越现有高效推理方法

Conclusion: DOT方法有效解决了大模型推理中的长度偏移现象，在保持复杂问题长程推理能力的同时，显著提高了推理效率

Abstract: Large reasoning models enhanced by reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards have achieved significant performance gains by extending their chain-of-thought. However, this paradigm incurs substantial deployment costs as models often exhibit excessive verbosity on simple queries. Existing efficient reasoning methods relying on explicit length penalties often introduce optimization conflicts and leave the generative mechanisms driving overthinking largely unexamined. In this paper, we identify a phenomenon termed length shift where models increasingly generate unnecessary reasoning on trivial inputs during training. To address this, we introduce Dynamic Outlier Truncation (DOT), a training-time intervention that selectively suppresses redundant tokens. This method targets only the extreme tail of response lengths within fully correct rollout groups while preserving long-horizon reasoning capabilities for complex problems. To complement this intervention and ensure stable convergence, we further incorporate auxiliary KL regularization and predictive dynamic sampling. Experimental results across multiple model scales demonstrate that our approach significantly pushes the efficiency-performance Pareto frontier outward. Notably, on the AIME-24, our method reduces inference token usage by 78% while simultaneously increasing accuracy compared to the initial policy and surpassing state-of-the-art efficient reasoning methods.

Conclusion: MobileDreamer通过高效的基于世界模型的前瞻框架，显著提升了移动GUI智能体在长时程任务中的性能，文本草图世界模型能够有效预测GUI状态变化。

Abstract: Mobile GUI agents have shown strong potential in real-world automation and practical applications. However, most existing agents remain reactive, making decisions mainly from current screen, which limits their performance on long-horizon tasks. Building a world model from repeated interactions enables forecasting action outcomes and supports better decision making for mobile GUI agents. This is challenging because the model must predict post-action states with spatial awareness while remaining efficient enough for practical deployment. In this paper, we propose MobileDreamer, an efficient world-model-based lookahead framework to equip the GUI agents based on the future imagination provided by the world model. It consists of textual sketch world model and rollout imagination for GUI agent. Textual sketch world model forecasts post-action states through a learning process to transform digital images into key task-related sketches, and designs a novel order-invariant learning strategy to preserve the spatial information of GUI elements. The rollout imagination strategy for GUI agent optimizes the action-selection process by leveraging the prediction capability of world model. Experiments on Android World show that MobileDreamer achieves state-of-the-art performance and improves task success by 5.25%. World model evaluations further verify that our textual sketch modeling accurately forecasts key GUI elements.

TL;DR: 该研究提出了"智能体漂移"概念，即多智能体LLM系统在长期运行中行为逐渐退化的问题，并开发了量化框架和缓解策略。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多智能体LLM系统虽然能处理复杂任务，但其长期行为稳定性尚未得到充分研究。随着系统运行时间延长，智能体可能出现行为退化、决策质量下降和协作失效等问题，这会影响生产系统的可靠性和安全性。

Method: 提出了智能体漂移的理论框架，包括语义漂移、协调漂移和行为漂移三种表现形式。开发了智能体稳定性指数（ASI），这是一个包含12个维度的复合度量框架，用于量化漂移现象。通过模拟分析和理论建模验证漂移影响。

Result: 研究表明，未受控制的智能体漂移会导致任务完成准确率显著降低，并增加人工干预需求。理论分析显示，提出的缓解策略（情景记忆巩固、漂移感知路由协议、自适应行为锚定）能显著减少漂移相关错误，同时保持系统吞吐量。

Conclusion: 该工作为生产级智能AI系统中的智能体漂移监测、度量和缓解建立了基础方法论，对企业部署可靠性和AI安全研究具有直接意义。强调了长期行为稳定性在多智能体系统中的重要性。

Abstract: Multi-agent Large Language Model (LLM) systems have emerged as powerful architectures for complex task decomposition and collaborative problem-solving. However, their long-term behavioral stability remains largely unexamined. This study introduces the concept of agent drift, defined as the progressive degradation of agent behavior, decision quality, and inter-agent coherence over extended interaction sequences. We present a comprehensive theoretical framework for understanding drift phenomena, proposing three distinct manifestations: semantic drift (progressive deviation from original intent), coordination drift (breakdown in multi-agent consensus mechanisms), and behavioral drift (emergence of unintended strategies).
  We introduce the Agent Stability Index (ASI), a novel composite metric framework for quantifying drift across twelve dimensions, including response consistency, tool usage patterns, reasoning pathway stability, and inter-agent agreement rates. Through simulation-based analysis and theoretical modeling, we demonstrate how unchecked agent drift can lead to substantial reductions in task completion accuracy and increased human intervention requirements.
  We propose three mitigation strategies: episodic memory consolidation, drift-aware routing protocols, and adaptive behavioral anchoring. Theoretical analysis suggests these approaches can significantly reduce drift-related errors while maintaining system throughput. This work establishes a foundational methodology for monitoring, measuring, and mitigating agent drift in production agentic AI systems, with direct implications for enterprise deployment reliability and AI safety research.

Motivation: 医学图像分割依赖高质量标注数据，但由于器官形态结构复杂和标注者差异，噪声标注普遍存在，严重影响分割模型性能。受医学图像标注员可根据先验知识修正标注错误的启发，需要开发能够自动处理噪声标注的鲁棒分割方法。

Conclusion: SVL-DRL框架能够有效处理医学图像分割中的噪声标注问题，通过分阶段强化学习和体素级智能体设计，自动修正标注错误，显著提升分割模型的鲁棒性和准确性。

Abstract: Deep learning has achieved significant advancements in medical image segmentation. Currently, obtaining accurate segmentation outcomes is critically reliant on large-scale datasets with high-quality annotations. However, noisy annotations are frequently encountered owing to the complex morphological structures of organs in medical images and variations among different annotators, which can substantially limit the efficacy of segmentation models. Motivated by the fact that medical imaging annotator can correct labeling errors during segmentation based on prior knowledge, we propose an end-to-end Staged Voxel-Level Deep Reinforcement Learning (SVL-DRL) framework for robust medical image segmentation under noisy annotations. This framework employs a dynamic iterative update strategy to automatically mitigate the impact of erroneous labels without requiring manual intervention. The key advancements of SVL-DRL over existing works include: i) formulating noisy annotations as a voxel-dependent problem and addressing it through a novel staged reinforcement learning framework which guarantees robust model convergence; ii) incorporating a voxel-level asynchronous advantage actor-critic (vA3C) module that conceptualizes each voxel as an autonomous agent, which allows each agent to dynamically refine its own state representation during training, thereby directly mitigating the influence of erroneous labels; iii) designing a novel action space for the agents, along with a composite reward function that strategically combines the Dice value and a spatial continuity metric to significantly boost segmentation accuracy while maintain semantic integrity. Experiments on three public medical image datasets demonstrates State-of-The-Art (SoTA) performance under various experimental settings, with an average improvement of over 3\% in both Dice and IoU scores.

Abstract: Intelligent tutoring systems have long enabled automated immediate feedback on student work when it is presented in a tightly structured format and when problems are very constrained, but reliably assessing free-form mathematical reasoning remains challenging.
  We present a system that processes free-form natural language input, handles a wide range of edge cases, and comments competently not only on the technical correctness of submitted proofs, but also on style and presentation issues. We discuss the advantages and disadvantages of various approaches to the evaluation of such a system, and show that by the metrics we evaluate, the quality of the feedback generated is comparable to that produced by human experts when assessing early undergraduate homework. We stress-test our system with a small set of more advanced and unusual questions, and report both significant gaps and encouraging successes in that more challenging setting.
  Our system uses large language models in a modular workflow. The workflow configuration is human-readable and editable without programming knowledge, and allows some intermediate steps to be precomputed or injected by the instructor.
  A version of our tool is deployed on the Imperial mathematics homework platform Lambdafeedback. We report also on the integration of our tool into this platform.

Motivation: 工程教育面临双重挑战：传统学徒制模式正在衰落，而生成式AI作为非正式指导伙伴出现。这引发了关于AI计算极限、具身理性本质以及信息处理与智慧区别的哲学问题，需要研究AI能否提供促进掌握而不仅仅是传递信息的指导。

Method: 采用混合方法研究，包括75名学生和7名教师的参与，探索在工程教育中使用指导聊天机器人。研究综合了数十年关于专业知识、隐性知识和人机交互的学术观点，并将其置于当代AI驱动教育的背景下。

Result: 研究发现一致的边界：参与者接受AI用于技术问题解决（收敛性任务，平均评分3.84/5），但对AI在道德、情感和情境判断（发散性任务）方面的能力持怀疑态度。教师对风险表达更强担忧（4.71 vs 4.14，p=0.003），64-71%参与者要求严格保密性。

Abstract: Engineering education faces a double disruption: traditional apprenticeship models that cultivated judgment and tacit skill are eroding, just as generative AI emerges as an informal coaching partner. This convergence rekindles long-standing questions in the philosophy of AI and cognition about the limits of computation, the nature of embodied rationality, and the distinction between information processing and wisdom. Building on this rich intellectual tradition, this paper examines whether AI chatbots can provide coaching that fosters mastery rather than merely delivering information. We synthesize critical perspectives from decades of scholarship on expertise, tacit knowledge, and human-machine interaction, situating them within the context of contemporary AI-driven education. Empirically, we report findings from a mixed-methods study (N = 75 students, N = 7 faculty) exploring the use of a coaching chatbot in engineering education. Results reveal a consistent boundary: participants accept AI for technical problem solving (convergent tasks; M = 3.84 on a 1-5 Likert scale) but remain skeptical of its capacity for moral, emotional, and contextual judgment (divergent tasks). Faculty express stronger concerns over risk (M = 4.71 vs. M = 4.14, p = 0.003), and privacy emerges as a key requirement, with 64-71 percent of participants demanding strict confidentiality. Our findings suggest that while generative AI can democratize access to cognitive and procedural support, it cannot replicate the embodied, value-laden dimensions of human mentorship. We propose a multiplex coaching framework that integrates human wisdom within expert-in-the-loop models, preserving the depth of apprenticeship while leveraging AI scalability to enrich the next generation of engineering education.

Abstract: Alignment of artificial intelligence (AI) encompasses the normative problem of specifying how AI systems should act and the technical problem of ensuring AI systems comply with those specifications. To date, AI alignment has generally overlooked an important source of knowledge and practice for grappling with these problems: law. In this paper, we aim to fill this gap by exploring how legal rules, principles, and methods can be leveraged to address problems of alignment and inform the design of AI systems that operate safely and ethically. This emerging field -- legal alignment -- focuses on three research directions: (1) designing AI systems to comply with the content of legal rules developed through legitimate institutions and processes, (2) adapting methods from legal interpretation to guide how AI systems reason and make decisions, and (3) harnessing legal concepts as a structural blueprint for confronting challenges of reliability, trust, and cooperation in AI systems. These research directions present new conceptual, empirical, and institutional questions, which include examining the specific set of laws that particular AI systems should follow, creating evaluations to assess their legal compliance in real-world settings, and developing governance frameworks to support the implementation of legal alignment in practice. Tackling these questions requires expertise across law, computer science, and other disciplines, offering these communities the opportunity to collaborate in designing AI for the better.

We systematically review prominent lightweight variants including MobileBERT, TinyBERT, DistilBERT, EfficientFormer, EdgeFormer, and MobileViT, providing detailed performance benchmarks on standard datasets such as GLUE, SQuAD, ImageNet-1K, and COCO. Our analysis encompasses current industry adoption patterns across major hardware platforms (NVIDIA Jetson, Qualcomm Snapdragon, Apple Neural Engine, ARM architectures), deployment frameworks (TensorFlow Lite, ONNX Runtime, PyTorch Mobile, CoreML), and optimization strategies. Experimental results demonstrate that modern lightweight transformers can achieve 75-96% of full-model accuracy while reducing model size by 4-10x and inference latency by 3-9x, enabling deployment on devices with as little as 2-5W power consumption. We identify sparse attention mechanisms, mixed-precision quantization (INT8/FP16), and hardware-aware neural architecture search as the most effective optimization strategies. Novel findings include memory-bandwidth bottleneck analysis revealing 15-40M parameter models achieve optimal hardware utilization (60-75% efficiency), quantization sweet spots for different model types, and comprehensive energy efficiency profiling across edge platforms. We establish real-time performance boundaries and provide a practical 6-step deployment pipeline achieving 8-12x size reduction with less than 2% accuracy degradation.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 论文阐明了Pivoted Cholesky分解在核方法中的几何解释，证明其枢轴选择等价于使用核度量的最远点采样，Cholesky因子构建是隐式Gram-Schmidt正交化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 虽然Pivoted Cholesky分解在数值线性代数中的代数性质已有充分研究，但其在核方法中的几何直觉往往不够清晰。本文旨在阐明该算法在再生核希尔伯特空间中的几何解释。

Method: 通过将Pivoted Cholesky分解与再生核希尔伯特空间中的几何概念联系起来，证明枢轴选择步骤在数学上等价于使用核度量的最远点采样，而Cholesky因子构建则是隐式的Gram-Schmidt正交化过程。

Result: 成功建立了Pivoted Cholesky分解的几何解释，提供了简洁的推导和极简的Python实现，弥合了理论与实践之间的差距。

Conclusion: Pivoted Cholesky分解在核方法中具有清晰的几何意义：枢轴选择对应于核度量空间中的最远点采样，而Cholesky因子构建实现了再生核希尔伯特空间中的正交化过程。

Abstract: Low-rank approximations of large kernel matrices are ubiquitous in machine learning, particularly for scaling Gaussian Processes to massive datasets. The Pivoted Cholesky decomposition is a standard tool for this task, offering a computationally efficient, greedy low-rank approximation. While its algebraic properties are well-documented in numerical linear algebra, its geometric intuition within the context of kernel methods often remains obscure. In this note, we elucidate the geometric interpretation of the algorithm within the Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS). We demonstrate that the pivotal selection step is mathematically equivalent to Farthest Point Sampling (FPS) using the kernel metric, and that the Cholesky factor construction is an implicit Gram-Schmidt orthogonalization. We provide a concise derivation and a minimalist Python implementation to bridge the gap between theory and practice.

TL;DR: R²VPO：一种基于策略比率方差约束的新型策略优化方法，通过软约束替代硬裁剪，在LLM对齐中实现更好的稳定性和数据效率


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前基于PPO和GRPO的on-policy强化学习方法使用策略比率硬裁剪，虽然稳定训练但存在两个根本问题：1）无差别截断高回报但高分歧动作的梯度，抑制复杂推理中的"顿悟时刻"；2）数据一旦过时就无法使用，导致严重的样本效率低下

Method: 提出R²VPO（Ratio-Variance Regularized Policy Optimization），基于对策略优化中信任区域目标的重新审视，通过显式约束策略比率的方差（二阶中心矩）来提供硬裁剪的原则性平滑松弛。采用原始-对偶框架，支持稳定的on-policy学习，并通过动态重新加权过时样本实现原则性的off-policy数据重用

Result: 在DeepSeek-Distill-Qwen-1.5B和openPangu-Embedded系列（1B和7B）等最先进LLM的微调实验中，R²VPO在数学推理基准测试中始终实现优越的渐近性能，相比基于硬裁剪的基线平均相对增益达17%，同时收敛所需rollout数量减少约50%

Conclusion: 策略比率方差控制是改进RL-based LLM对齐中稳定性和数据效率的有前景方向，R²VPO通过软约束方法有效解决了硬裁剪的局限性

Abstract: On-policy reinforcement learning (RL), particularly Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), has become the dominant paradigm for fine-tuning large language models (LLMs). While policy ratio clipping stabilizes training, this heuristic hard constraint incurs a fundamental cost: it indiscriminately truncates gradients from high-return yet high-divergence actions, suppressing rare but highly informative "eureka moments" in complex reasoning. Moreover, once data becomes slightly stale, hard clipping renders it unusable, leading to severe sample inefficiency. In this work, we revisit the trust-region objective in policy optimization and show that explicitly constraining the \emph{variance (second central moment) of the policy ratio} provides a principled and smooth relaxation of hard clipping. This distributional constraint stabilizes policy updates while preserving gradient signals from valuable trajectories. Building on this insight, we propose $R^2VPO$ (Ratio-Variance Regularized Policy Optimization), a novel primal-dual framework that supports stable on-policy learning and enables principled off-policy data reuse by dynamically reweighting stale samples rather than discarding them. We extensively evaluate $R^2VPO$ on fine-tuning state-of-the-art LLMs, including DeepSeek-Distill-Qwen-1.5B and the openPangu-Embedded series (1B and 7B), across challenging mathematical reasoning benchmarks. Experimental results show that $R^2VPO$ consistently achieves superior asymptotic performance, with average relative gains of up to 17% over strong clipping-based baselines, while requiring approximately 50% fewer rollouts to reach convergence. These findings establish ratio-variance control as a promising direction for improving both stability and data efficiency in RL-based LLM alignment.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种用于放射学报告生成的自洽框架，通过"推理-总结"架构和组相对策略优化，显著减少了事实性幻觉并提升了临床效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 多模态大语言模型在放射学报告生成方面展现出潜力，但面临架构异构性和事实性幻觉问题。标准监督微调难以严格对齐语言输出与视觉证据，现有强化学习方法则存在计算成本过高或探索能力有限的问题。

Method: 首先系统评估医学影像的最佳视觉编码器和LLM骨干配置；然后提出新颖的"推理-总结"架构，通过组相对策略优化进行优化；该框架将生成过程分为详细发现的"思考块"和结构化疾病标签的"回答块"；使用多维复合奖励函数，明确惩罚生成叙述与最终诊断之间的逻辑不一致。

Result: 在MIMIC-CXR基准测试上的广泛实验表明，该方法在临床效果指标上达到最先进性能，相比强监督基线显著减少了幻觉现象。

Conclusion: 提出的自洽放射学报告生成框架通过优化的架构设计和强化学习策略，有效解决了多模态大语言模型在医疗应用中的幻觉问题，为临床转化提供了可行方案。

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have shown strong potential for radiology report generation, yet their clinical translation is hindered by architectural heterogeneity and the prevalence of factual hallucinations. Standard supervised fine-tuning often fails to strictly align linguistic outputs with visual evidence, while existing reinforcement learning approaches struggle with either prohibitive computational costs or limited exploration. To address these challenges, we propose a comprehensive framework for self-consistent radiology report generation. First, we conduct a systematic evaluation to identify optimal vision encoder and LLM backbone configurations for medical imaging. Building on this foundation, we introduce a novel "Reason-then-Summarize" architecture optimized via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). This framework restructures generation into two distinct components: a think block for detailed findings and an answer block for structured disease labels. By utilizing a multi-dimensional composite reward function, we explicitly penalize logical discrepancies between the generated narrative and the final diagnosis. Extensive experiments on the MIMIC-CXR benchmark demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in clinical efficacy metrics and significantly reduces hallucinations compared to strong supervised baselines.

TL;DR: 该研究提出了首个用于法国野火严重程度预测的序数分类框架，通过比较不同损失函数设计来提升对罕见高严重度火灾的预测能力，发现序数监督显著优于传统方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 野火在空间和严重程度上高度不平衡，预测极端事件特别困难。研究旨在开发与法国运营决策直接对齐的野火严重程度预测框架，重点关注损失函数设计对预测罕见但关键的高严重度火灾能力的影响。

Method: 引入首个用于野火严重程度预测的序数分类框架，比较标准交叉熵与多种序数感知目标函数，包括提出的基于截断离散指数广义帕累托分布的概率TDeGPD损失。使用多种架构和真实运营数据进行广泛基准测试。

Result: 序数监督显著优于传统方法，加权Kappa损失（WKLoss）获得最佳整体结果，在最极端严重度类别上获得超过+0.1的IoU增益，同时保持有竞争力的校准质量。但由于数据集中罕见事件的代表性极低，对这些事件的预测性能仍然有限。

Conclusion: 研究强调了将严重程度排序、数据不平衡考虑和季节性风险整合到野火预测系统中的重要性。未来工作将专注于将季节动态和不确定性信息纳入训练，以进一步提高极端事件预测的可靠性。

Abstract: Wildfires are highly imbalanced natural hazards in both space and severity, making the prediction of extreme events particularly challenging. In this work, we introduce the first ordinal classification framework for forecasting wildfire severity levels directly aligned with operational decision-making in France. Our study investigates the influence of loss-function design on the ability of neural models to predict rare yet critical high-severity fire occurrences. We compare standard cross-entropy with several ordinal-aware objectives, including the proposed probabilistic TDeGPD loss derived from a truncated discrete exponentiated Generalized Pareto Distribution. Through extensive benchmarking over multiple architectures and real operational data, we show that ordinal supervision substantially improves model performance over conventional approaches. In particular, the Weighted Kappa Loss (WKLoss) achieves the best overall results, with more than +0.1 IoU gain on the most extreme severity classes while maintaining competitive calibration quality. However, performance remains limited for the rarest events due to their extremely low representation in the dataset. These findings highlight the importance of integrating both severity ordering, data imbalance considerations, and seasonality risk into wildfire forecasting systems. Future work will focus on incorporating seasonal dynamics and uncertainty information into training to further improve the reliability of extreme-event prediction.

TL;DR: ALERT是一个基于放大的零样本越狱检测器，通过逐层、逐模块、逐token放大良性提示与越狱提示的内部特征差异，实现高效的零样本检测。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 尽管已有丰富的安全对齐策略，大语言模型仍然容易受到越狱攻击。现有检测方法主要依赖训练数据中的越狱模板，但现实场景中新攻击不断涌现，需要解决更具挑战性的零样本越狱检测问题。

Method: 提出层级、模块级和token级的放大框架，逐步放大良性提示与越狱提示的内部特征差异。识别安全相关层、编码零样本判别信号的特定模块，以及信息丰富的安全token。在此基础上构建ALERT检测器，在放大表示上引入两个独立但互补的分类器。

Result: 在三个安全基准测试上的实验表明，ALERT实现了稳定强大的零样本检测性能：(1)在所有数据集和攻击策略中，ALERT始终排名前二；(2)在平均准确率和F1分数上至少优于第二好的基线10%，有时高达40%。

Conclusion: ALERT通过放大内部特征差异的方法，有效解决了零样本越狱检测的挑战，为应对不断演变的越狱攻击提供了高效实用的解决方案。

Abstract: Despite rich safety alignment strategies, large language models (LLMs) remain highly susceptible to jailbreak attacks, which compromise safety guardrails and pose serious security risks. Existing detection methods mainly detect jailbreak status relying on jailbreak templates present in the training data. However, few studies address the more realistic and challenging zero-shot jailbreak detection setting, where no jailbreak templates are available during training. This setting better reflects real-world scenarios where new attacks continually emerge and evolve. To address this challenge, we propose a layer-wise, module-wise, and token-wise amplification framework that progressively magnifies internal feature discrepancies between benign and jailbreak prompts. We uncover safety-relevant layers, identify specific modules that inherently encode zero-shot discriminative signals, and localize informative safety tokens. Building upon these insights, we introduce ALERT (Amplification-based Jailbreak Detector), an efficient and effective zero-shot jailbreak detector that introduces two independent yet complementary classifiers on amplified representations. Extensive experiments on three safety benchmarks demonstrate that ALERT achieves consistently strong zero-shot detection performance. Specifically, (i) across all datasets and attack strategies, ALERT reliably ranks among the top two methods, and (ii) it outperforms the second-best baseline by at least 10% in average Accuracy and F1-score, and sometimes by up to 40%.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统路径规划算法（如A*和Dijkstra）虽然能提供最优解，但计算复杂度高，在动态环境中难以实现实时应用，特别是在考虑天气条件对无人机操作影响的情况下

Method: 通过传统算法模拟生成合成数据集，训练机器学习和深度学习模型；采用基于Transformer和注意力机制的架构，整合天气启发式信息（风模式、风向、温度等）来预测最优下一节点选择

Result: 天气感知模型相比传统算法实现显著计算加速，同时保持路线优化性能；基于Transformer的架构在动态环境约束下表现出更优的适应性

Conclusion: 该框架为大规模无人机服务运营提供了实时、天气响应的路线优化能力，显著提升了自主无人机系统的效率和安全性

Abstract: This paper presents a novel framework to accelerate route prediction in Drone-as-a-Service operations through weather-aware deep learning models. While classical path-planning algorithms, such as A* and Dijkstra, provide optimal solutions, their computational complexity limits real-time applicability in dynamic environments. We address this limitation by training machine learning and deep learning models on synthetic datasets generated from classical algorithm simulations. Our approach incorporates transformer-based and attention-based architectures that utilize weather heuristics to predict optimal next-node selections while accounting for meteorological conditions affecting drone operations. The attention mechanisms dynamically weight environmental factors including wind patterns, wind bearing, and temperature to enhance routing decisions under adverse weather conditions. Experimental results demonstrate that our weather-aware models achieve significant computational speedup over traditional algorithms while maintaining route optimization performance, with transformer-based architectures showing superior adaptation to dynamic environmental constraints. The proposed framework enables real-time, weather-responsive route optimization for large-scale DaaS operations, representing a substantial advancement in the efficiency and safety of autonomous drone systems.

TL;DR: 提出SIGMA框架，通过嵌入Gram矩阵的谱分析来量化大语言模型在合成数据递归训练中的模型崩溃现象。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 合成数据训练LLM导致"模型崩溃"问题日益明显，但缺乏在高维空间中量化预测崩溃的严格方法。

Method: 引入SIGMA框架，通过推导Gram矩阵谱的确定性和随机边界，提供数学基础指标来跟踪表示空间的收缩。

Result: SIGMA能有效捕捉向退化状态的转变，其随机公式可实现可扩展的边界估计，适用于大规模基础模型。

Conclusion: SIGMA为模型崩溃机制提供理论洞察，并为递归训练管道的健康监控提供实用、可扩展的工具。

Abstract: The rapid adoption of synthetic data for training Large Language Models (LLMs) has introduced the technical challenge of "model collapse"-a degenerative process where recursive training on model-generated content leads to a contraction of distributional variance and representational quality. While the phenomenology of collapse is increasingly evident, rigorous methods to quantify and predict its onset in high-dimensional spaces remain elusive. In this paper, we introduce SIGMA (Spectral Inequalities for Gram Matrix Analysis), a unified framework that benchmarks model collapse through the spectral lens of the embedding Gram matrix. By deriving and utilizing deterministic and stochastic bounds on the matrix's spectrum, SIGMA provides a mathematically grounded metric to track the contraction of the representation space. Crucially, our stochastic formulation enables scalable estimation of these bounds, making the framework applicable to large-scale foundation models where full eigendecomposition is intractable. We demonstrate that SIGMA effectively captures the transition towards degenerate states, offering both theoretical insights into the mechanics of collapse and a practical, scalable tool for monitoring the health of recursive training pipelines.

TL;DR: PanSubNet是一个可解释的深度学习框架，能够直接从标准H&E染色全切片图像预测胰腺导管腺癌的治疗相关分子亚型（基底样和经典型），解决了传统分子分型成本高、耗时长、组织需求大的临床限制问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 胰腺导管腺癌（PDAC）的分子分型（基底样和经典型）具有重要的预后和预测价值，但在临床实践中应用受限，主要因为成本高、周转时间长、组织需求大。需要一种能够从常规H&E染色切片直接预测分子亚型的方法，以促进PDAC的精准治疗。

Method: 开发了PanSubNet深度学习框架，使用来自两个多机构队列（PANCAN，n=846；TCGA，n=209）的1055名患者的配对组织学和RNA-seq数据。采用经过GATA6表达优化的Moffitt 50基因特征作为金标准标签。模型采用双尺度架构，融合细胞级形态学和组织级结构，利用注意力机制进行多尺度表示学习和透明特征归因。

Result: 在PANCAN内部验证中（五折交叉验证），平均AUC达到88.5%，敏感性和特异性平衡。在独立TCGA队列的外部验证中（未微调）表现出强大的泛化能力（AUC 84.0%）。模型预测与转录组程序、分化标志物和DNA损伤修复特征一致。预测不确定性反映了中间转录状态而非分类噪声。

Conclusion: PanSubNet通过从常规H&E染色切片实现快速、经济有效的分子分层，提供了一个临床可部署且可解释的遗传分型工具，支持整合到数字病理工作流程中，推进PDAC的精准肿瘤学发展。

Abstract: Molecular subtyping of PDAC into basal-like and classical has established prognostic and predictive value. However, its use in clinical practice is limited by cost, turnaround time, and tissue requirements, thereby restricting its application in the management of PDAC. We introduce PanSubNet, an interpretable deep learning framework that predicts therapy-relevant molecular subtypes directly from standard H&E-stained WSIs. PanSubNet was developed using data from 1,055 patients across two multi-institutional cohorts (PANCAN, n=846; TCGA, n=209) with paired histology and RNA-seq data. Ground-truth labels were derived using the validated Moffitt 50-gene signature refined by GATA6 expression. The model employs dual-scale architecture that fuses cellular-level morphology with tissue-level architecture, leveraging attention mechanisms for multi-scale representation learning and transparent feature attribution. On internal validation within PANCAN using five-fold cross-validation, PanSubNet achieved mean AUC of 88.5% with balanced sensitivity and specificity. External validation on the independent TCGA cohort without fine-tuning demonstrated robust generalizability (AUC 84.0%). PanSubNet preserved and, in metastatic disease, strengthened prognostic stratification compared to RNA-seq based labels. Prediction uncertainty linked to intermediate transcriptional states, not classification noise. Model predictions are aligned with established transcriptomic programs, differentiation markers, and DNA damage repair signatures. By enabling rapid, cost-effective molecular stratification from routine H&E-stained slides, PanSubNet offers a clinically deployable and interpretable tool for genetic subtyping. We are gathering data from two institutions to validate and assess real-world performance, supporting integration into digital pathology workflows and advancing precision oncology for PDAC.

Motivation: 质疑混合专家模型通过稀疏路由实现领域专业化的普遍假设，探究MoE模型实际的路由行为模式。

Method: 提出COMMITTEEAUDIT后验分析框架，在专家群体层面而非个体专家层面分析路由行为，在三个代表性模型和MMLU基准上进行实验。

Result: 发现存在领域不变的"常设委员会"现象：一个紧凑的专家联盟在不同领域、层次和路由预算下都占据大部分路由权重；常设委员会锚定推理结构和语法，而边缘专家处理领域特定知识。

Conclusion: MoE模型存在强烈的集中计算结构偏向，专业化程度远低于普遍认知；当前训练目标（如强制均匀专家利用的负载均衡损失）可能违背模型的自然优化路径，限制了训练效率和性能。

Abstract: Mixture of Experts models are widely assumed to achieve domain specialization through sparse routing. In this work, we question this assumption by introducing COMMITTEEAUDIT, a post hoc framework that analyzes routing behavior at the level of expert groups rather than individual experts. Across three representative models and the MMLU benchmark, we uncover a domain-invariant Standing Committee. This is a compact coalition of routed experts that consistently captures the majority of routing mass across domains, layers, and routing budgets, even when architectures already include shared experts. Qualitative analysis further shows that Standing Committees anchor reasoning structure and syntax, while peripheral experts handle domain-specific knowledge. These findings reveal a strong structural bias toward centralized computation, suggesting that specialization in Mixture of Experts models is far less pervasive than commonly believed. This inherent bias also indicates that current training objectives, such as load-balancing losses that enforce uniform expert utilization, may be working against the model's natural optimization path, thereby limiting training efficiency and performance.

TL;DR: VNU-Bench是首个针对新闻领域的多源跨视频理解基准测试，包含429个新闻组、1,405个视频和2,501个高质量问题，旨在评估模型在多源新闻理解方面的能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有新闻视频理解基准主要关注单源、视频内推理，而现实世界新闻消费本质上是多源的——同一事件由不同媒体以互补细节、不同叙事选择和有时相互矛盾的说法报道。鲁棒的新闻理解需要模型能够比较不同来源的观点、对齐跨来源的多模态证据并综合多源信息。

Method: 1) 设计了一套新的问题类型，从多个角度测试模型理解多源多模态新闻的能力；2) 开发了新颖的混合人机QA生成流程，解决了构建跨源新闻理解大规模数据集时的可扩展性和质量控制问题。

Result: 构建的数据集包含429个新闻组、1,405个视频和2,501个高质量问题。对闭源和开源多模态模型的综合评估表明，VNU-Bench对当前MLLMs构成了实质性挑战。

Conclusion: VNU-Bench填补了多源跨视频新闻理解基准的空白，为评估模型在现实世界新闻消费场景中的能力提供了重要工具，揭示了当前MLLMs在多源新闻理解方面的局限性。

Abstract: News videos are carefully edited multimodal narratives that combine narration, visuals, and external quotations into coherent storylines. In recent years, there have been significant advances in evaluating multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for news video understanding. However, existing benchmarks largely focus on single-source, intra-video reasoning, where each report is processed in isolation. In contrast, real-world news consumption is inherently multi-sourced: the same event is reported by different outlets with complementary details, distinct narrative choices, and sometimes conflicting claims that unfold over time. Robust news understanding, therefore, requires models to compare perspectives from different sources, align multimodal evidence across sources, and synthesize multi-source information. To fill this gap, we introduce VNU-Bench, the first benchmark for multi-source, cross-video understanding in the news domain. We design a set of new question types that are unique in testing models' ability of understanding multi-source multimodal news from a variety of different angles. We design a novel hybrid human-model QA generation process that addresses the issues of scalability and quality control in building a large dataset for cross-source news understanding. The dataset comprises 429 news groups, 1,405 videos, and 2,501 high-quality questions. Comprehensive evaluation of both closed- and open-source multimodal models shows that VNU-Bench poses substantial challenges for current MLLMs.

Motivation: 用户自定义文本分类（UDTC）在实际应用中经常遇到，如企业分析、内容审核和领域特定信息检索，需要处理用户指定的、先前未见过的类别，现有方法难以有效应对这一挑战。

Method: 提出软上下文编码器架构，将每个候选标签与标签集和输入查询的静态软提示表示进行上下文化处理，在多样化的多源数据集上进行训练，使模型能够泛化到从任意领域抽取的完全未见过的主题集。

Conclusion: 提出的软上下文编码器架构能够有效处理用户自定义文本分类任务，在零样本分类场景下表现出色，为实际应用中的文本分类问题提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: User-Defined Text Classification (UDTC) considers the challenge of classifying input text to user-specified, previously unseen classes, a setting that arises frequently in real-world applications such as enterprise analytics, content moderation, and domain-specific information retrieval. We propose a soft-contextualized encoder architecture for UDTC which contextualizes each candidate label with the label set and a static soft prompt representation of the input query. Training on diverse, multi-source datasets enables the model to generalize effectively to zero-shot classification over entirely unseen topic sets drawn from arbitrary domains. We evaluate the proposed architecture both on held-out in-distribution test data and on multiple unseen UDTC benchmarks. Across datasets, the model achieves state-of-the-art performance, consistently outperforming or matching the baselines.

Motivation: 现有驾驶员行为分析方法通常使用机器学习和深度学习技术，但这些方法往往存在特征优化不足的问题，既影响了高性能又牺牲了可解释性。为了填补这些空白，需要一种既能保持高预测性能又能提供解释性的混合方法。

Method: 采用混合方法：首先使用来自Kaggle的12,857行18列数据集，应用标签编码、随机过采样和标准缩放等预处理技术；测试13种机器学习算法；然后使用LIME（局部可解释模型无关解释）技术识别对准确性影响最大的前10个特征；最后基于这些特征重新训练算法。

Result: 随机森林分类器初始准确率达到95%；应用LIME技术识别关键特征后重新训练，准确率略微下降至94.2%，但模型效率得到提升，且获得了更好的可解释性。研究表明可以在不牺牲性能的情况下提高模型效率。

Conclusion: 这种混合模型在驾驶员行为分析中提供了预测能力和可解释性的投资回报，能够在保持高性能的同时提供对决策过程的解释，有助于改善道路安全和减少攻击性或注意力不集中的驾驶行为。

Abstract: Progressive driver behavior analytics is crucial for improving road safety and mitigating the issues caused by aggressive or inattentive driving. Previous studies have employed machine learning and deep learning techniques, which often result in low feature optimization, thereby compromising both high performance and interpretability. To fill these voids, this paper proposes a hybrid approach to driver behavior analysis that uses a 12,857-row and 18-column data set taken from Kaggle. After applying preprocessing techniques such as label encoding, random oversampling, and standard scaling, 13 machine learning algorithms were tested. The Random Forest Classifier achieved an accuracy of 95%. After deploying the LIME technique in XAI, the top 10 features with the most significant positive and negative influence on accuracy were identified, and the same algorithms were retrained. The accuracy of the Random Forest Classifier decreased slightly to 94.2%, confirming that the efficiency of the model can be improved without sacrificing performance. This hybrid model can provide a return on investment in terms of the predictive power and explainability of the driver behavior process.

TL;DR: VeRPO提出了一种基于可验证执行反馈的密集奖励强化学习框架，通过加权部分成功构建密集奖励，显著提升代码生成性能，同时计算成本极低。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前代码生成强化学习中，主流的是基于单元测试通过/失败的稀疏奖励，限制了性能提升。虽然已有研究探索使用外部奖励模型生成连续奖励，但这些模型存在奖励不对齐和高计算成本的问题。

Method: VeRPO的核心思想是基于加权部分成功构建密集奖励：在训练过程中根据执行统计动态估计每个单元测试的难度权重，从通过的单元测试权重总和推导出密集奖励。为了确保部分成功与端到端功能正确性的一致性，VeRPO进一步将密集信号与全局执行结果整合，建立仅依赖可验证执行反馈的鲁棒密集奖励范式。

Result: 在多个基准测试和设置下的广泛实验表明，VeRPO始终优于基于结果驱动和基于奖励模型的基线方法，在pass@1指标上实现了高达+8.83%的提升，时间成本极低（<0.02%），且GPU内存开销为零。

Conclusion: VeRPO通过合成完全基于可验证执行反馈的鲁棒密集奖励，解决了代码生成强化学习中奖励设计的核心挑战，在保持低计算成本的同时显著提升了性能。

Abstract: Effective reward design is a central challenge in Reinforcement Learning (RL) for code generation. Mainstream pass/fail outcome rewards enforce functional correctness via executing unit tests, but the resulting sparsity limits potential performance gains. While recent work has explored external Reward Models (RM) to generate richer, continuous rewards, the learned RMs suffer from reward misalignment and prohibitive computational cost. In this paper, we introduce \textbf{VeRPO} (\textbf{V}erifiable D\textbf{e}nse \textbf{R}eward \textbf{P}olicy \textbf{O}ptimization), a novel RL framework for code generation that synthesizes \textit{robust and dense rewards fully grounded in verifiable execution feedback}. The core idea of VeRPO is constructing dense rewards from weighted partial success: by dynamically estimating the difficulty weight of each unit test based on the execution statistics during training, a dense reward is derived from the sum of weights of the passed unit tests. To solidify the consistency between partial success and end-to-end functional correctness, VeRPO further integrates the dense signal with global execution outcomes, establishing a robust and dense reward paradigm relying solely on verifiable execution feedback. Extensive experiments across diverse benchmarks and settings demonstrate that VeRPO consistently outperforms outcome-driven and RM-based baselines, achieving up to +8.83\% gain in pass@1 with negligible time cost (< 0.02\%) and zero GPU memory overhead.

TL;DR: 提出了一种可设计的格林函数框架(DGF)和基于此的格林函数球面神经算子(GSNO)，用于在保持球面几何的同时建模真实世界的异质性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的球面深度学习方法在平衡强球面几何归纳偏置与建模真实世界异质性方面面临挑战，需要一种既能保留球面几何又能处理异质性的解决方案。

Method: 首先引入可设计的格林函数框架(DGF)作为新的球面算子求解策略，然后提出GSNO融合三种算子解：等变解（用于对称一致建模）、不变解（消除干扰异质性）、各向异性解（建模各向异性系统）。

Result: 在球面MNIST、浅水方程、扩散MRI纤维预测、皮层分区和分子结构建模等任务上的评估表明GSNO具有优越性。

Conclusion: GSNO能够在保留谱效率的同时适应具有干扰变异性和各向异性的真实世界异质系统，为球面深度学习提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Spherical deep learning has been widely applied to a broad range of real-world problems. Existing approaches often face challenges in balancing strong spherical geometric inductive biases with the need to model real-world heterogeneity. To solve this while retaining spherical geometry, we first introduce a designable Green's function framework (DGF) to provide new spherical operator solution strategy: Design systematic Green's functions under rotational group. Based on DGF, to model biological heterogeneity, we propose Green's-Function Spherical Neural Operator (GSNO) fusing 3 operator solutions: (1) Equivariant Solution derived from Equivariant Green's Function for symmetry-consistent modeling; (2) Invariant Solution derived from Invariant Green's Function to eliminate nuisance heterogeneity, e.g., consistent background field; (3) Anisotropic Solution derived from Anisotropic Green's Function to model anisotropic systems, especially fibers with preferred direction. Therefore, the resulting model, GSNO can adapt to real-world heterogeneous systems with nuisance variability and anisotropy while retaining spectral efficiency. Evaluations on spherical MNIST, Shallow Water Equation, diffusion MRI fiber prediction, cortical parcellation and molecule structure modeling demonstrate the superiority of GSNO.

Motivation: 慢性疾病如糖尿病的管理面临重大挑战，特别是低血糖等并发症需要及时检测和干预。虽然可穿戴传感器的连续健康监测为血糖事件的早期预测提供了有前景的解决方案，但多传感器数据的有效使用受到信号噪声和频繁缺失值的阻碍。

Abstract: Chronic diseases such as diabetes pose significant management challenges, particularly due to the risk of complications like hypoglycemia, which require timely detection and intervention. Continuous health monitoring through wearable sensors offers a promising solution for early prediction of glycemic events. However, effective use of multisensor data is hindered by issues such as signal noise and frequent missing values. This study examines the limitations of existing datasets and emphasizes the temporal characteristics of key features relevant to hypoglycemia prediction. A comprehensive analysis of imputation techniques is conducted, focusing on those employed in state-of-the-art studies. Furthermore, imputation methods derived from machine learning and deep learning applications in other healthcare contexts are evaluated for their potential to address longer gaps in time-series data. Based on this analysis, a systematic paradigm is proposed, wherein imputation strategies are tailored to the nature of specific features and the duration of missing intervals. The review concludes by emphasizing the importance of investigating the temporal dynamics of individual features and the implementation of multiple, feature-specific imputation techniques to effectively address heterogeneous temporal patterns inherent in the data.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的时空局部内在维度（stLID）方法，用于检测滑坡灾害中的失效区域，通过结合空间和时间信息来提升检测精度和提前预警时间。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有方法主要依赖地表位移数据，通过统计或机器学习技术分析，但往往无法充分捕捉滑坡数据中固有的空间相关性和时间动态特性，导致在复杂滑坡和同一斜坡多个连续失效区域的检测上存在不足。

Method: 基于现有的sLID方法进行三方面扩展：1）运动学增强：将速度纳入sLID计算以捕捉短期时间依赖和变形率关系；2）空间融合：应用贝叶斯估计在空间邻域聚合sLID值，嵌入空间相关性；3）时间建模：引入tLID从时间序列数据学习长期动态。最终整合为统一的时空LID（stLID）框架。

Result: 大量实验表明，stLID在失效检测精度和提前预警时间方面持续优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 提出的stLID方法通过有效结合空间和时间信息，能够更准确地检测复杂滑坡和多个连续失效区域，为地质灾害缓解提供了更有效的工具。

Abstract: Local Intrinsic Dimensionality (LID) has shown strong potential for identifying anomalies and outliers in high-dimensional data across a wide range of real-world applications, including landslide failure detection in granular media. Early and accurate identification of failure zones in landslide-prone areas is crucial for effective geohazard mitigation. While existing approaches typically rely on surface displacement data analyzed through statistical or machine learning techniques, they often fall short in capturing both the spatial correlations and temporal dynamics that are inherent in such data. To address this gap, we focus on ground-monitored landslides and introduce a novel approach that jointly incorporates spatial and temporal information, enabling the detection of complex landslides and including multiple successive failures occurring in distinct areas of the same slope. To be specific, our method builds upon an existing LID-based technique, known as sLID. We extend its capabilities in three key ways. (1) Kinematic enhancement: we incorporate velocity into the sLID computation to better capture short-term temporal dependencies and deformation rate relationships. (2) Spatial fusion: we apply Bayesian estimation to aggregate sLID values across spatial neighborhoods, effectively embedding spatial correlations into the LID scores. (3) Temporal modeling: we introduce a temporal variant, tLID, that learns long-term dynamics from time series data, providing a robust temporal representation of displacement behavior. Finally, we integrate both components into a unified framework, referred to as spatiotemporal LID (stLID), to identify samples that are anomalous in either or both dimensions. Extensive experiments show that stLID consistently outperforms existing methods in failure detection precision and lead-time.

TL;DR: 本文为混合专家模型建立了首个统一理论框架，从贝叶斯和信息论角度严格推导了Top-k路由和负载均衡机制，证明了路由问题的NP-hard本质，发现了"相干性障碍"，并验证了几何正交性作为大规模模型最优工程松弛方案。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 混合专家模型虽然能高效扩展大语言模型，但其核心机制（Top-k路由和辅助负载均衡）仍然是启发式的，缺乏统一的理论基础。本文旨在为这些实践提供严谨的理论支撑。

Method: 建立统一理论框架，从贝叶斯视角将路由问题形式化为最优稀疏后验近似和先验正则化，从信息论视角将其框架化为最小化路由模糊度和最大化信道容量。将路由问题定义为NP-hard的稀疏子集选择问题，并分析几何正交性对问题可解性的影响。

Result: 严格证明了"相干性障碍"的存在：当专家表示具有高互相干性时，贪婪路由策略理论上无法恢复最优专家子集。形式化验证了在专家特征空间中施加几何正交性足以缩小NP-hard全局最优解与多项式时间贪婪近似之间的差距。

Conclusion: 正交性正则化是大规模模型的最优工程松弛方案。本文为混合专家模型的深入理解和创新设计提供了必要的理论支持和技术保证。

Abstract: Mixture-of-Experts models enable large language models to scale efficiently, as they only activate a subset of experts for each input. Their core mechanisms, Top-k routing and auxiliary load balancing, remain heuristic, however, lacking a cohesive theoretical underpinning to support them. To this end, we build the first unified theoretical framework that rigorously derives these practices as optimal sparse posterior approximation and prior regularization from a Bayesian perspective, while simultaneously framing them as mechanisms to minimize routing ambiguity and maximize channel capacity from an information-theoretic perspective. We also pinpoint the inherent combinatorial hardness of routing, defining it as the NP-hard sparse subset selection problem. We rigorously prove the existence of a "Coherence Barrier"; when expert representations exhibit high mutual coherence, greedy routing strategies theoretically fail to recover the optimal expert subset. Importantly, we formally verify that imposing geometric orthogonality in the expert feature space is sufficient to narrow the divide between the NP-hard global optimum and polynomial-time greedy approximation. Our comparative analyses confirm orthogonality regularization as the optimal engineering relaxation for large-scale models. Our work offers essential theoretical support and technical assurance for a deeper understanding and novel designs of MoE.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 联邦学习在现实部署中面临统计异构性的挑战，客户端异质性会扭曲本地梯度动态，导致系统性漂移并阻碍全局收敛，需要找到稳定异构FL系统的方法。

Method: 提出客户端视角的通用框架，通过调节本地梯度贡献来稳定FL。具体实现为探索-收敛梯度重聚合(ECGR)方法，平衡对齐和未对齐的梯度分量，保留信息性更新同时抑制不稳定效应。

Result: 理论分析和大量实验（包括LC25000医学影像数据集评估）表明，调节本地梯度动态能一致地稳定异构数据分布下的联邦学习，优于现有方法。

Conclusion: 本地梯度动态是稳定异构联邦学习的关键调节杠杆，通过客户端视角调节梯度贡献能有效提升FL稳定性而不增加通信开销，ECGR方法为此提供了有效实现。

Abstract: Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across distributed clients without sharing raw data, yet its stability is fundamentally challenged by statistical heterogeneity in realistic deployments. Here, we show that client heterogeneity destabilizes FL primarily by distorting local gradient dynamics during client-side optimization, causing systematic drift that accumulates across communication rounds and impedes global convergence. This observation highlights local gradients as a key regulatory lever for stabilizing heterogeneous FL systems. Building on this insight, we develop a general client-side perspective that regulates local gradient contributions without incurring additional communication overhead. Inspired by swarm intelligence, we instantiate this perspective through Exploratory--Convergent Gradient Re-aggregation (ECGR), which balances well-aligned and misaligned gradient components to preserve informative updates while suppressing destabilizing effects. Theoretical analysis and extensive experiments, including evaluations on the LC25000 medical imaging dataset, demonstrate that regulating local gradient dynamics consistently stabilizes federated learning across state-of-the-art methods under heterogeneous data distributions.

Motivation: 智能手机感知为追踪与心理健康相关的日常行为提供了无干扰且可扩展的方法，但现有研究主要关注已有状况的检测，而预测心理健康能够通过及时适应性干预提供主动支持。

Method: 使用College Experience Sensing（CES）数据集，这是迄今为止最广泛的大学生心理健康纵向数据集，系统评估了传统机器学习、深度学习和大型语言模型方法，考虑了时间窗口、特征粒度、个性化策略和类别不平衡处理等因素。

Result: 深度学习模型（特别是Transformer，Macro-F1 = 0.58）取得了最佳整体性能；大语言模型在上下文推理方面表现出优势但在时间建模方面较弱；个性化策略显著改善了严重心理健康状态的预测。

Conclusion: 通过揭示不同建模方法如何随时间解释手机感知行为数据，这项工作为下一代自适应、以人为中心的心理健康技术奠定了基础，能够推动研究和现实世界的福祉。

Abstract: Smartphone sensing offers an unobtrusive and scalable way to track daily behaviors linked to mental health, capturing changes in sleep, mobility, and phone use that often precede symptoms of stress, anxiety, or depression. While most prior studies focus on detection that responds to existing conditions, forecasting mental health enables proactive support through Just-in-Time Adaptive Interventions. In this paper, we present the first comprehensive benchmarking study comparing traditional machine learning (ML), deep learning (DL), and large language model (LLM) approaches for mental health forecasting using the College Experience Sensing (CES) dataset, the most extensive longitudinal dataset of college student mental health to date. We systematically evaluate models across temporal windows, feature granularities, personalization strategies, and class imbalance handling. Our results show that DL models, particularly Transformer (Macro-F1 = 0.58), achieve the best overall performance, while LLMs show strength in contextual reasoning but weaker temporal modeling. Personalization substantially improves forecasts of severe mental health states. By revealing how different modeling approaches interpret phone sensing behavioral data over time, this work lays the groundwork for next-generation, adaptive, and human-centered mental health technologies that can advance both research and real-world well-being.

Motivation: 现有Tree-of-Thoughts框架中的搜索算法往往忽视语言模型推理的高计算成本，特别是在计算预算受限的场景下，需要更高效的搜索策略来减少思维评估次数。

Method: 将Levin树搜索算法适配到ToT框架，利用语言模型输出的概率作为启发式函数指导树探索，减少思维生成数量，并分析温度参数对搜索边界的影响。

Result: 在固定语言模型查询预算下，LTS在三个领域（Blocksworld、PrOntoQA、Array Sorting）和四种不同语言模型上，相比基线搜索算法获得相当或更高的准确率。

Conclusion: LTS在ToT框架中实现了成本效益和时间效率的平衡，特别适合延迟敏感和资源受限的应用场景，为受限计算预算下的问题解决提供了有效方案。

Abstract: Recent studies explored integrating state-space search algorithms with Language Models (LM) to perform look-ahead on the token generation process, the ''Tree-of-Thoughts'' (ToT), generated by LMs, thereby improving performance on problem-solving tasks. However, the affiliated search algorithms often overlook the significant computational costs associated with LM inference, particularly in scenarios with constrained computational budgets. Consequently, we address the problem of improving LM performance on problem-solving tasks under limited computational budgets. We demonstrate how the probabilities assigned to thoughts by LMs can serve as a heuristic to guide search within the ToT framework, thereby reducing the number of thought evaluations. Building on this insight, we adapt a heuristic search algorithm, Levin Tree Search (LTS), to the ToT framework, which leverages LMs as policies to guide the tree exploration efficiently. We extend the theoretical results of LTS by showing that, for ToT (a pruned tree), LTS guarantees a bound on the number of states expanded, and consequently, on the number of thoughts generated. Additionally, we analyze the sensitivity of this bound to the temperature values commonly used in the final softmax layer of the LM. Empirical evaluation under a fixed LM query budget demonstrates that LTS consistently achieves comparable or higher accuracy than baseline search algorithms within the ToT framework, across three domains (Blocksworld, PrOntoQA, Array Sorting) and four distinct LMs. These findings highlight the efficacy of LTS on ToT, particularly in enabling cost-effective and time-efficient problem-solving, making it well-suited for latency-critical and resource-constrained applications.

Focusing on Beethoven's piano sonatas as a case study, we empirically verify the independence of pitch and hand attributes using normalized mutual information (NMI=0.167) and propose the Smart Embedding architecture, achieving a 48.30% reduction in parameters. We provide rigorous mathematical proofs using information theory (negligible loss bounded at 0.153 bits), Rademacher complexity (28.09% tighter generalization bound), and category theory to demonstrate improved stability and generalization. Empirical results show a 9.47% reduction in validation loss, confirmed by SVD analysis and an expert listening study (N=53). This dual theoretical and applied framework bridges gaps in AI music generation, offering verifiable insights for mathematically grounded deep learning.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实制造系统中的作业调度问题在规模增大时，现有解决方案存在运行时间长或调度质量不足的问题，需要更高效的调度方法。

Method: ReLA采用结构化表示学习和聚合技术，通过两个实体内部学习模块（自注意力和卷积）和一个实体间学习模块（交叉注意力）学习作业操作和机器的多样化表示，并在多尺度架构中聚合这些表示来支持强化学习决策。

Result: 在小、中、大规模作业实例实验中，ReLA在大多数测试设置中实现了最佳调度时间。在非大规模实例上，将SOTA基线的最优性差距降低了13.0%；在大规模实例上降低了78.6%，平均最优性差距分别降至7.3%和2.1%。

Conclusion: ReLA学习的表示和聚合为强化学习调度提供了强大的决策支持，能够实现快速的作业完成和决策制定，适用于实际应用场景。

Abstract: Job scheduling is widely used in real-world manufacturing systems to assign ordered job operations to machines under various constraints. Existing solutions remain limited by long running time or insufficient schedule quality, especially when problem scale increases. In this paper, we propose ReLA, a reinforcement-learning (RL) scheduler built on structured representation learning and aggregation. ReLA first learns diverse representations from scheduling entities, including job operations and machines, using two intra-entity learning modules with self-attention and convolution and one inter-entity learning module with cross-attention. These modules are applied in a multi-scale architecture, and their outputs are aggregated to support RL decision-making. Across experiments on small, medium, and large job instances, ReLA achieves the best makespan in most tested settings over the latest solutions. On non-large instances, ReLA reduces the optimality gap of the SOTA baseline by 13.0%, while on large-scale instances it reduces the gap by 78.6%, with the average optimality gaps lowered to 7.3% and 2.1%, respectively. These results confirm that ReLA's learned representations and aggregation provide strong decision support for RL scheduling, and enable fast job completion and decision-making for real-world applications.

Motivation: 基础模型虽然强大但决策过程不透明，神经科学和人工智能领域一直关注是否存在类似"祖母细胞"的神经元，即对单一概念具有排他性响应的可解释神经元。

Method: 提出两种信息论度量来量化神经元对单一概念的显著性和选择性，将这些指标应用于TabPFN表格基础模型的表示，通过简单的神经元-概念对搜索找到最显著和最具选择性的配对。

Conclusion: 可解释神经元可以自然涌现，在某些情况下无需借助更复杂的可解释性技术即可识别，这为理解基础模型的内部工作机制提供了新视角。

Abstract: Foundation models are powerful yet often opaque in their decision-making. A topic of continued interest in both neuroscience and artificial intelligence is whether some neurons behave like grandmother cells, i.e., neurons that are inherently interpretable because they exclusively respond to single concepts. In this work, we propose two information-theoretic measures that quantify the neuronal saliency and selectivity for single concepts. We apply these metrics to the representations of TabPFN, a tabular foundation model, and perform a simple search across neuron-concept pairs to find the most salient and selective pair. Our analysis provides the first evidence that some neurons in such models show moderate, statistically significant saliency and selectivity for high-level concepts. These findings suggest that interpretable neurons can emerge naturally and that they can, in some cases, be identified without resorting to more complex interpretability techniques.

TL;DR: AMIR-GRPO在GRPO基础上增加了基于组内奖励排名的隐式对比正则化器，解决了GRPO在推理任务中的长度偏差、低质量轨迹惩罚不足和标量目标信息丢失问题，在数学推理任务上表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: GRPO在复杂推理任务中存在结构性限制：序列级优势归一化引入系统长度偏差、低质量轨迹惩罚被稀释、标量目标丢弃了组内奖励排名中的丰富成对偏好信息，导致昂贵的rollout监督信息未被充分利用。

Method: 提出AMIR-GRPO，在GRPO基础上增加了一个隐式DPO风格的对比正则化器，直接从组内奖励排名构建，无需额外标注。该机制增强了对低奖励轨迹的抑制，减轻了响应级长度偏差，并将每个rollout组转化为更密集的监督约束集。

Result: 在多个数学推理基准测试中，AMIR-GRPO持续优于强GRPO基线，在正确和错误推理链之间产生更清晰的分离，并在标准GRPO已解决的实例之外提供了更广泛的覆盖增益。

Conclusion: 通过利用组内奖励排名中的成对偏好信息，AMIR-GRPO有效解决了GRPO在推理任务中的结构限制，实现了更好的监督信息利用和性能提升。

Abstract: Reinforcement learning has become the primary paradigm for aligning large language models (LLMs) on complex reasoning tasks, with group relative policy optimization (GRPO) widely used in large-scale post-training. However, GRPO faces structural limitations in reasoning-heavy settings: sequence-level advantage normalization introduces systematic length bias, penalties for low-quality trajectories are diluted, and the scalar objective discards rich pairwise preference information embedded in within-group reward rankings. As a result, valuable supervision from costly rollouts remains underutilized.
  We propose AMIR-GRPO, which augments GRPO with an implicit DPO-style contrastive regularizer constructed directly from intra-group reward rankings, requiring no additional annotations. This mechanism amplifies suppression of low-reward trajectories, attenuates response-level length bias, and transforms each rollout group into a denser set of supervision constraints. Across multiple mathematical reasoning benchmarks, AMIR-GRPO consistently outperforms strong GRPO baselines, yields clearer separation between correct and incorrect reasoning chains, and delivers broader coverage gains beyond the subset of instances solved by standard GRPO.

Motivation: 现有异常检测方法在处理具有不同局部密度的数据集时存在局限：基于距离的方法会错过局部异常，而基于密度的方法需要仔细的参数选择且具有二次时间复杂度。

Method: 提出SVEAD方法，构建随机Voronoi图集成，通过归一化的单元相对距离加权局部尺度来对点进行评分，将数据空间分解为受限区域并在每个区域内独立检查。

Result: 在45个数据集上的实验表明，SVEAD优于12种最先进的方法，实现了线性时间复杂度和常数空间复杂度。

Conclusion: 通过几何洞察将数据空间分解为受限区域，SVEAD能够有效识别局部异常，克服了现有方法在处理不同局部密度数据集时的局限性。

Abstract: Anomaly detection aims to identify data instances that deviate significantly from majority of data, which has been widely used in fraud detection, network security, and industrial quality control. Existing methods struggle with datasets exhibiting varying local densities: distance-based methods miss local anomalies, while density-based approaches require careful parameter selection and incur quadratic time complexity. We observe that local anomalies, though indistinguishable under global analysis, become conspicuous when the data space is decomposed into restricted regions and each region is examined independently. Leveraging this geometric insight, we propose SVEAD (Stochastic Voronoi Ensembles Anomaly Detector), which constructs ensemble random Voronoi diagrams and scores points by normalized cell-relative distances weighted by local scale. The proposed method achieves linear time complexity and constant space complexity. Experiments on 45 datasets demonstrate that SVEAD outperforms 12 state-of-the-art approaches.

Motivation: 传统RNN预测器采用编码器策略，将滑动历史窗口作为输入预测未来值，但这种方法对所有时间步和隐藏状态同等对待，没有考虑它们对预测的不同贡献，导致性能不佳。

Method: 提出RRE-PPO4Pred方法：1) 强化循环编码器框架，将RNN内部适应过程建模为马尔可夫决策过程；2) 改进的预测导向近端策略优化算法，配备Transformer智能体进行时序推理；3) 协同进化优化范式，促进RNN预测器和策略智能体的学习。

Result: 在五个真实世界数据集上的综合评估表明，该方法始终优于现有基准方法，并且达到了比最先进的Transformer模型更好的准确性。

Conclusion: RRE-PPO4Pred方法显著提高了RNN模型的时间序列建模能力和预测准确性，为工程信息学提供了先进的时间序列预测器。

Abstract: Time series forecasting plays a crucial role in contemporary engineering information systems for supporting decision-making across various industries, where Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) have been widely adopted due to their capability in modeling sequential data. Conventional RNN-based predictors adopt an encoder-only strategy with sliding historical windows as inputs to forecast future values. However, this approach treats all time steps and hidden states equally without considering their distinct contributions to forecasting, leading to suboptimal performance. To address this limitation, we propose a novel Reinforced Recurrent Encoder with Prediction-oriented Proximal Policy Optimization, RRE-PPO4Pred, which significantly improves time series modeling capacity and forecasting accuracy of the RNN models. The core innovations of this method are: (1) A novel Reinforced Recurrent Encoder (RRE) framework that enhances RNNs by formulating their internal adaptation as a Markov Decision Process, creating a unified decision environment capable of learning input feature selection, hidden skip connection, and output target selection; (2) An improved Prediction-oriented Proximal Policy Optimization algorithm, termed PPO4Pred, which is equipped with a Transformer-based agent for temporal reasoning and develops a dynamic transition sampling strategy to enhance sampling efficiency; (3) A co-evolutionary optimization paradigm to facilitate the learning of the RNN predictor and the policy agent, providing adaptive and interactive time series modeling. Comprehensive evaluations on five real-world datasets indicate that our method consistently outperforms existing baselines, and attains accuracy better than state-of-the-art Transformer models, thus providing an advanced time series predictor in engineering informatics.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: RXNEmb是一种基于RXNGraphormer预训练模型的新型反应级描述符，通过区分真实反应与虚构反应来学习内在的键形成和断裂模式，可用于反应指纹分析和可视化。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 随着数据驱动反应预测模型的兴起，需要有效的反应描述符来弥合真实化学与数字表示之间的差距。然而，通用的反应级描述符仍然稀缺。

Method: 研究引入RXNEmb，这是一种从RXNGraphormer模型衍生的新型反应级描述符。该模型通过预训练来区分真实反应与具有错误键变化的虚构反应，从而学习内在的键形成和断裂模式。

Result: RXNEmb成功应用于USPTO-50k数据集的数据驱动重新聚类，产生了比基于规则的分类更能直接反映键变化相似性的分类。结合降维技术，RXNEmb能够可视化反应空间的多样性。注意力权重分析揭示了模型对化学关键位点的关注，提供了机理洞察。

Conclusion: RXNEmb作为一种强大且可解释的工具，可用于反应指纹分析和分析，为反应分析和发现中更数据驱动的方法铺平了道路。

Abstract: With the rise of data-driven reaction prediction models, effective reaction descriptors are crucial for bridging the gap between real-world chemistry and digital representations. However, general-purpose, reaction-wise descriptors remain scarce. This study introduces RXNEmb, a novel reaction-level descriptor derived from RXNGraphormer, a model pre-trained to distinguish real reactions from fictitious ones with erroneous bond changes, thereby learning intrinsic bond formation and cleavage patterns. We demonstrate its utility by data-driven re-clustering of the USPTO-50k dataset, yielding a classification that more directly reflects bond-change similarities than rule-based categories. Combined with dimensionality reduction, RXNEmb enables visualization of reaction space diversity. Furthermore, attention weight analysis reveals the model's focus on chemically critical sites, providing mechanistic insight. RXNEmb serves as a powerful, interpretable tool for reaction fingerprinting and analysis, paving the way for more data-centric approaches in reaction analysis and discovery.

Conclusion: 图生成扩散模型存在严重的隐私泄露风险。作者提出的两种防御机制能够有效缓解这些推理攻击，并在防御强度和模型效用之间取得更好的平衡。

Abstract: Graph generative diffusion models have recently emerged as a powerful paradigm for generating complex graph structures, effectively capturing intricate dependencies and relationships within graph data. However, the privacy risks associated with these models remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we investigate information leakage in such models through three types of black-box inference attacks. First, we design a graph reconstruction attack, which can reconstruct graphs structurally similar to those training graphs from the generated graphs. Second, we propose a property inference attack to infer the properties of the training graphs, such as the average graph density and the distribution of densities, from the generated graphs. Third, we develop two membership inference attacks to determine whether a given graph is present in the training set. Extensive experiments on three different types of graph generative diffusion models and six real-world graphs demonstrate the effectiveness of these attacks, significantly outperforming the baseline approaches. Finally, we propose two defense mechanisms that mitigate these inference attacks and achieve a better trade-off between defense strength and target model utility than existing methods.

TL;DR: TreeAdv通过树状结构优势重分配改进基于群体的强化学习，在数学推理任务上以更少token实现更好性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统的GRPO方法将每个轨迹视为独立序列，为所有token分配相同的序列级优势，导致样本效率低下和长度偏差（倾向于冗长冗余的思维链而不增加逻辑深度）

Method: TreeAdv（树状结构优势重分配）显式地利用群体rollouts的树状结构进行探索和优势分配。具体包括：1）基于熵驱动的采样方法构建树群（森林），在高不确定性决策处分支，在低不确定性token处共享；2）通过重分配完整rollouts（所有叶节点）的优势来聚合内部树段的token级优势；3）可轻松应用于GRPO或GSPO等基于群体的目标

Result: 在10个数学推理基准测试中，TreeAdv始终优于GRPO和GSPO，同时在相同的监督、数据和解码预算下使用显著更少的生成token

Conclusion: TreeAdv通过显式建模群体rollouts的树状结构，有效解决了传统基于群体RL方法的样本效率低下和长度偏差问题，在数学推理任务上实现了更好的性能与效率平衡

Abstract: Reinforcement learning with group-based objectives, such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), is a common framework for aligning large language models on complex reasoning tasks. However, standard GRPO treats each rollout trajectory as an independent flat sequence and assigns a single sequence-level advantage to all tokens, which leads to sample inefficiency and a length bias toward verbose, redundant chains of thought without improving logical depth. We introduce TreeAdv (Tree-Structured Advantage Redistribution for Group-Based RL), which makes the tree structure of group rollouts explicit for both exploration and advantage assignment. Specifically, TreeAdv builds a group of trees (a forest) based on an entropy-driven sampling method where each tree branches at high-uncertainty decisions while sharing low-uncertainty tokens across rollouts. Then, TreeAdv aggregates token-level advantages for internal tree segments by redistributing the advantages of complete rollouts (all leaf nodes), and TreeAdv can easily apply to group-based objectives such as GRPO or GSPO. Across 10 math reasoning benchmarks, TreeAdv consistently outperforms GRPO and GSPO, while using substantially fewer generated tokens under identical supervision, data, and decoding budgets.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 该论文提出了一种基于注意力图谱的训练无关机制探针，通过计算代数连通性、平滑度和谱熵等指标，为语言模型提供稳定的"谱指纹"，揭示了传统评估方法遗漏的模型内部处理机制。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 行为基准测试只能告诉我们模型做了什么，但不能揭示模型是如何工作的。为了理解语言模型的内部工作机制，需要开发能够探测其处理机制的诊断工具。

Method: 提出一种训练无关的机制探针，将每个注意力层视为令牌图，计算代数连通性(λ₂)、平滑度和谱熵等谱特征，形成"谱指纹"来分析模型内部处理机制。

Result: 发现了四种关键结果：1) 特定课程转换导致英语语法触发的连通性崩溃(PTCC)；2) PTCC反映了形式路由强化与风格灵活性之间的权衡；3) 识别出四种可复现的处理策略；4) PTCC定位于稀疏的补偿性注意力头，激活引导可部分恢复连通性。

Conclusion: 注意力图谱为模型审计和训练机制验证提供了实用工具，揭示了模型内部处理机制与训练课程、语言特性之间的系统关系。

Abstract: Behavioral benchmarks tell us \textit{what} a model does, but not \textit{how}. We introduce a training-free mechanistic probe using attention-graph spectra. Treating each layer as a token graph, we compute algebraic connectivity ($λ_2$), smoothness, and spectral entropy. Across 12 models and 10 languages, these measures yield stable ``spectral fingerprints'' that expose discontinuities missed by standard evaluation.
  We report four results. (1) Models undergoing specific curriculum transitions (e.g., code-to-chat) show an English-only, syntax-triggered connectivity failure on non-canonical constructions, reaching $Δλ_2 \approx -0.76$. We term this scar \textit{Passive-Triggered Connectivity Collapse} (PTCC). Analysis of the Phi lineage reveals that PTCC appears and resolves across developmental stages, implicating brittle curriculum shifts rather than synthetic data per se. (2) PTCC reflects a specialization trade-off: strengthened formal routing at the expense of stylistic flexibility. (3) We identify four recurrent processing strategies; simple frozen-threshold rules enable perfect forensic identification across lineages. (4) Mechanistically, PTCC localizes to a sparse Layer 2 ``compensatory patch'' of heads that fails under syntactic stress; activation steering can partially restore connectivity, recovering $\approx 38\%$ of lost information flow.
  Finally, dominant topological regimes track tokenization density more than language identity, suggesting ``healthy'' geometry varies systematically across scripts. Overall, attention-graph spectra provide a practical tool for auditing and training-regime verification.

TL;DR: 本文提出弹性信任区域（ETR）算法，通过动态调整优化约束来改进GRPO在RLVR中的局限性，实现更好的信号利用和探索保持。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前RLVR领域主导算法GRPO存在结构限制：对所有样本施加统一、静态的信任区域约束，这假设信号同质性，与结果驱动学习中优势幅度和方差显著波动的异质性现实不符。静态约束无法充分利用高质量信号，同时抑制噪声不足，常导致快速熵崩溃。

Method: 提出弹性信任区域（ETR）机制，通过双层次弹性构建信号感知的优化景观：微观层面基于优势幅度缩放裁剪边界，加速从高置信度路径学习；宏观层面利用组方差隐式分配更大更新预算给处于最优学习区域的任务。

Result: 在AIME和MATH基准测试上的广泛实验表明，ETR始终优于GRPO，实现更高的准确性，同时有效缓解策略熵退化，确保持续探索。

Conclusion: ETR通过动态信任区域约束解决了GRPO的静态限制，更好地适应了RLVR中信号异质性的特点，在保持探索的同时提升了学习效率和性能。

Abstract: Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) has emerged as an important paradigm for unlocking reasoning capabilities in large language models, exemplified by the success of OpenAI o1 and DeepSeek-R1. Currently, Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) stands as the dominant algorithm in this domain due to its stable training and critic-free efficiency. However, we argue that GRPO suffers from a structural limitation: it imposes a uniform, static trust region constraint across all samples. This design implicitly assumes signal homogeneity, a premise misaligned with the heterogeneous nature of outcome-driven learning, where advantage magnitudes and variances fluctuate significantly. Consequently, static constraints fail to fully exploit high-quality signals while insufficiently suppressing noise, often precipitating rapid entropy collapse. To address this, we propose \textbf{E}lastic \textbf{T}rust \textbf{R}egions (\textbf{ETR}), a dynamic mechanism that aligns optimization constraints with signal quality. ETR constructs a signal-aware landscape through dual-level elasticity: at the micro level, it scales clipping boundaries based on advantage magnitude to accelerate learning from high-confidence paths; at the macro level, it leverages group variance to implicitly allocate larger update budgets to tasks in the optimal learning zone. Extensive experiments on AIME and MATH benchmarks demonstrate that ETR consistently outperforms GRPO, achieving superior accuracy while effectively mitigating policy entropy degradation to ensure sustained exploration.

TL;DR: EDCO是一个用于领域特定大语言模型微调的新型动态课程学习框架，通过推理熵和动态课程编排来提升学习效率，相比静态课程方法在多个领域表现更优。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的大语言模型微调方法大多采用静态课程学习策略，这种策略在训练前设计好课程顺序，缺乏对模型在微调过程中动态需求的适应性。为了解决这个问题，需要开发能够根据模型学习状态动态调整的课程学习框架。

Method: EDCO框架基于推理熵和动态课程编排两个核心概念，包含三个核心组件：1）使用前缀标记近似完整序列熵的高效熵估计器；2）基于熵的课程生成器，选择推理熵最高的数据点；3）在选定课程上优化模型的LLM训练器。

Result: 在通信、医学和法律领域的综合实验中，EDCO在监督学习和强化学习设置下，对Qwen3-4B和Llama3.2-3B模型的微调效果优于传统课程策略。此外，提出的高效熵估计方法在保持高精度的同时将计算时间减少了83.5%。

Conclusion: EDCO通过动态调整课程学习策略，基于推理熵优先选择对模型学习最有益的训练样本，显著提升了领域特定大语言模型的微调效率和效果，为自适应课程学习提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Domain-specific large language models (LLMs), typically developed by fine-tuning a pre-trained general-purpose LLM on specialized datasets, represent a significant advancement in applied AI. A common strategy in LLM fine-tuning is curriculum learning, which pre-orders training samples based on metrics like difficulty to improve learning efficiency compared to a random sampling strategy. However, most existing methods for LLM fine-tuning rely on a static curriculum, designed prior to training, which lacks adaptability to the model's evolving needs during fine-tuning. To address this, we propose EDCO, a novel framework based on two key concepts: inference entropy and dynamic curriculum orchestration. Inspired by recent findings that maintaining high answer entropy benefits long-term reasoning gains, EDCO prioritizes samples with high inference entropy in a continuously adapted curriculum. EDCO integrates three core components: an efficient entropy estimator that uses prefix tokens to approximate full-sequence entropy, an entropy-based curriculum generator that selects data points with the highest inference entropy, and an LLM trainer that optimizes the model on the selected curriculum. Comprehensive experiments in communication, medicine and law domains, EDCO outperforms traditional curriculum strategies for fine-tuning Qwen3-4B and Llama3.2-3B models under supervised and reinforcement learning settings. Furthermore, the proposed efficient entropy estimation reduces computational time by 83.5% while maintaining high accuracy.

TL;DR: GEM-2是一个概率变换器模型，直接学习全球大气动力学和用户决策相关的变量，相比传统数值天气预报模型和复杂ML模型，在计算效率和预测性能上都有显著优势。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 天气预报用户面临一个困难权衡：许多决策相关的目标（如极值、累积量、阈值超过）是大气状态变量的函数，而非状态变量本身。用户需要通过后处理来估计这些目标，但这可能不够优化并引入结构偏差。核心问题是决策依赖于这些函数分布的预测，而传统模型并未直接学习这些分布。

Method: 引入GEM-2概率变换器，联合学习全球大气动力学和用户直接作用的变量套件。使用CRPS（连续排名概率得分）目标训练，模型轻量级（约2.75亿参数），计算效率高（相比最先进模型有20-100倍训练加速）。

Result: GEM-2直接超越业务数值天气预报模型，与依赖昂贵多步扩散过程或需要定制多阶段微调策略的ML模型竞争。在决策理论评估下展示最先进的经济价值指标，在S2S和季节时间尺度上稳定收敛到气候学，对许多通常假设的架构和训练设计选择表现出令人惊讶的不敏感性。

Conclusion: 通过直接训练用户决策相关的目标函数，GEM-2提供了一种更有效、更准确的天气预报方法，解决了传统天气预报中后处理带来的问题，为高价值决策提供了更好的支持。

Abstract: Weather forecasts sit upstream of high-stakes decisions in domains such as grid operations, aviation, agriculture, and emergency response. Yet forecast users often face a difficult trade-off. Many decision-relevant targets are functionals of the atmospheric state variables, such as extrema, accumulations, and threshold exceedances, rather than state variables themselves. As a result, users must estimate these targets via post-processing, which can be suboptimal and can introduce structural bias. The core issue is that decisions depend on distributions over these functionals that the model is not trained to learn directly.
  In this work, we introduce GEM-2, a probabilistic transformer that jointly learns global atmospheric dynamics alongside a suite of variables that users directly act upon. Using this training recipe, we show that a lightweight (~275M params) and computationally efficient (~20-100x training speedup relative to state-of-the-art) transformer trained on the CRPS objective can directly outperform operational numerical weather prediction (NWP) models and be competitive with ML models that rely on expensive multi-step diffusion processes or require bespoke multi-stage fine-tuning strategies. We further demonstrate state-of-the-art economic value metrics under decision-theoretic evaluation, stable convergence to climatology at S2S and seasonal timescales, and a surprising insensitivity to many commonly assumed architectural and training design choices.

Motivation: 语义后门检测是一个重要但研究较少的问题。与基于触发模式的后门相比，语义后门更难检测，因为缺乏清晰可识别的模式。研究基于消费者保护场景，监管机构需要检测机器学习服务提供商是否在模型中植入了后门。

Method: 方法假设已知干净的训练数据集和训练方法。监管机构创建参考模型池，训练少量干净和中毒模型，校准模型距离阈值来识别干净模型。提出了多种计算模型距离的方法，并测试了提供者进行自适应攻击避免检测的场景。最可靠的方法是基于要求提供者进行对抗训练，通过反转模型生成最大化与干净样本距离的输入样本来测量模型距离。

Result: 该方法通常能够完全分离干净和中毒模型，在检测语义后门方面优于现有最先进的后门检测器。在对抗训练设置下，通过模型反转生成的样本测量模型距离效果最佳。

Conclusion: 提出的方法在已知训练数据和训练方法的情况下，能够有效检测语义后门攻击，为消费者保护场景中的机器学习服务安全评估提供了实用解决方案。基于对抗训练和模型反转的方法在检测可靠性和准确性方面表现最佳。

Abstract: Detecting semantic backdoors in classification models--where some classes can be activated by certain natural, but out-of-distribution inputs--is an important problem that has received relatively little attention. Semantic backdoors are significantly harder to detect than backdoors that are based on trigger patterns due to the lack of such clearly identifiable patterns. We tackle this problem under the assumption that the clean training dataset and the training recipe of the model are both known. These assumptions are motivated by a consumer protection scenario, in which the responsible authority performs mystery shopping to test a machine learning service provider. In this scenario, the authority uses the provider's resources and tools to train a model on a given dataset and tests whether the provider included a backdoor. In our proposed approach, the authority creates a reference model pool by training a small number of clean and poisoned models using trusted infrastructure, and calibrates a model distance threshold to identify clean models. We propose and experimentally analyze a number of approaches to compute model distances and we also test a scenario where the provider performs an adaptive attack to avoid detection. The most reliable method is based on requesting adversarial training from the provider. The model distance is best measured using a set of input samples generated by inverting the models in such a way as to maximize the distance from clean samples. With these settings, our method can often completely separate clean and poisoned models, and it proves to be superior to state-of-the-art backdoor detectors as well.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有单轮联邦学习方法在真实世界领域（如医学影像）性能不佳，处理非IID数据时效率低下，需要更有效的解决方案。

Method: 1) 使用预训练视觉编码器将图像压缩为分层token序列捕获多尺度语义；2) 多尺度自回归transformer生成器建模token序列分布并生成合成序列；3) 客户端上传合成序列和本地分类器；4) 服务器端引入知识蒸馏减少对精确分布建模的依赖。

Result: 在医学和自然图像数据集上的实验表明，FALCON在多种非IID场景下有效，平均准确率比最佳OSFL基线高出9.58%。

Conclusion: FALCON框架通过分层token序列生成和知识蒸馏，显著提升了单轮联邦学习在非IID图像数据上的鲁棒性和性能。

Abstract: One-shot federated learning (OSFL) reduces the communication cost and privacy risks of iterative federated learning by constructing a global model with a single round of communication. However, most existing methods struggle to achieve robust performance on real-world domains such as medical imaging, or are inefficient when handling non-IID (Independent and Identically Distributed) data. To address these limitations, we introduce FALCON, a framework that enhances the effectiveness of OSFL over non-IID image data. The core idea of FALCON is to leverage the feature-aware hierarchical token sequences generation and knowledge distillation into OSFL. First, each client leverages a pretrained visual encoder with hierarchical scale encoding to compress images into hierarchical token sequences, which capture multi-scale semantics. Second, a multi-scale autoregressive transformer generator is used to model the distribution of these token sequences and generate the synthetic sequences. Third, clients upload the synthetic sequences along with the local classifier trained on the real token sequences to the server. Finally, the server incorporates knowledge distillation into global training to reduce reliance on precise distribution modeling. Experiments on medical and natural image datasets validate the effectiveness of FALCON in diverse non-IID scenarios, outperforming the best OSFL baselines by 9.58% in average accuracy.

Result: 在数学推理任务上使用Qwen3大语言模型，ABC-GRPO相比标准GRPO取得了更优的性能，并且在训练过程中保持了更高的熵值

Conclusion: ABC-GRPO通过自适应边界裁剪机制有效提升了GRPO算法的性能，保持了模型的探索能力，避免了过早收敛，代码已开源便于复现

Abstract: Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) has emerged as a popular algorithm for reinforcement learning with large language models (LLMs). However, upon analyzing its clipping mechanism, we argue that it is suboptimal in certain scenarios. With appropriate modifications, GRPO can be significantly enhanced to improve both flexibility and generalization. To this end, we propose Adaptive-Boundary-Clipping GRPO (ABC-GRPO), an asymmetric and adaptive refinement of the original GRPO framework. We demonstrate that ABC-GRPO achieves superior performance over standard GRPO on mathematical reasoning tasks using the Qwen3 LLMs. Moreover, ABC-GRPO maintains substantially higher entropy throughout training, thereby preserving the model's exploration capacity and mitigating premature convergence. The implementation code is available online to ease reproducibility https://github.com/chi2liu/ABC-GRPO.

TL;DR: FOREVER是一个基于遗忘曲线启发的持续学习框架，通过模型时间概念和自适应重放调度来缓解大语言模型的灾难性遗忘问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有持续学习方法大多依赖固定的步数启发式重放策略，这些策略与模型实际学习进度不匹配，因为相同的训练步骤可能导致不同程度的参数变化。受人类遗忘曲线启发，作者提出需要更符合模型内部演化规律的重放调度方法。

Method: FOREVER框架包含三个核心组件：1) 基于优化器更新幅度的模型时间定义；2) 遗忘曲线启发的重放调度器，决定何时重放；3) 强度感知的正则化机制，自适应控制如何重放。该方法将重放间隔与模型内部演化而非原始训练步骤对齐。

Result: 在三个持续学习基准测试和参数规模从0.6B到13B的模型上进行的广泛实验表明，FOREVER能够持续缓解灾难性遗忘问题，表现优于传统方法。

Conclusion: FOREVER通过引入模型时间概念和遗忘曲线启发的重放调度，提供了一种更符合大语言模型学习动态的持续学习方法，有效解决了传统步数启发式策略与模型实际学习进度不匹配的问题。

Abstract: Continual learning (CL) for large language models (LLMs) aims to enable sequential knowledge acquisition without catastrophic forgetting. Memory replay methods are widely used for their practicality and effectiveness, but most rely on fixed, step-based heuristics that often misalign with the model's actual learning progress, since identical training steps can result in varying degrees of parameter change. Motivated by recent findings that LLM forgetting mirrors the Ebbinghaus human forgetting curve, we propose FOREVER (FORgEtting curVe-inspired mEmory Replay), a novel CL framework that aligns replay schedules with a model-centric notion of time. FOREVER defines model time using the magnitude of optimizer updates, allowing forgetting curve-inspired replay intervals to align with the model's internal evolution rather than raw training steps. Building on this approach, FOREVER incorporates a forgetting curve-based replay scheduler to determine when to replay and an intensity-aware regularization mechanism to adaptively control how to replay. Extensive experiments on three CL benchmarks and models ranging from 0.6B to 13B parameters demonstrate that FOREVER consistently mitigates catastrophic forgetting.

Motivation: 传统癌症生存预测模型通常将所有疾病阶段的数据混合训练，这可能高估性能并忽视阶段特异性差异。同时，现有机器学习生存分析研究缺乏可解释性和透明度。

Method: 使用SEER数据集，为结直肠癌、胃癌和肝癌创建特定阶段的机器学习预测模型，并应用SHAP和LIME等可解释性技术来分析特征与癌症阶段之间的相互作用。

Conclusion: 特定阶段的模型提供了对每个癌症阶段最重要因素的新见解，通过提高透明度和临床相关性，支持个性化治疗规划。

Abstract: Despite the fact that cancer survivability rates vary greatly between stages, traditional survival prediction models have frequently been trained and assessed using examples from all combined phases of the disease. This method may result in an overestimation of performance and ignore the stage-specific variations. Using the SEER dataset, we created and verified explainable machine learning (ML) models to predict stage-specific cancer survivability in colorectal, stomach, and liver cancers. ML-based cancer survival analysis has been a long-standing topic in the literature; however, studies involving the explainability and transparency of ML survivability models are limited. Our use of explainability techniques, including SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) and Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME), enabled us to illustrate significant feature-cancer stage interactions that would have remained hidden in traditional black-box models.

Motivation: 机械连杆机构设计面临节点位置连续变化、拓扑结构离散配置和非线性运动约束之间的复杂耦合问题。传统优化和启发式方法在组合爆炸的设计空间中计算不可行，且微小扰动会显著改变轨迹，需要新的可扩展逆向设计方法。

Conclusion: 该工作推进了自回归图生成方法和计算运动学合成，为复杂机械系统的可扩展逆向设计建立了新范式。

Abstract: Designing mechanical linkages to achieve target end-effector trajectories presents a fundamental challenge due to the intricate coupling between continuous node placements, discrete topological configurations, and nonlinear kinematic constraints. The highly nonlinear motion-to-configuration relationship means small perturbations in joint positions drastically alter trajectories, while the combinatorially expanding design space renders conventional optimization and heuristic methods computationally intractable. We introduce an autoregressive diffusion framework that exploits the dyadic nature of linkage assembly by representing mechanisms as sequentially constructed graphs, where nodes correspond to joints and edges to rigid links. Our approach combines a causal transformer with a Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM), both conditioned on target trajectories encoded via a transformer encoder. The causal transformer autoregressively predicts discrete topology node-by-node, while the DDPM refines each node's spatial coordinates and edge connectivity to previously generated nodes. This sequential generation enables adaptive trial-and-error synthesis where problematic nodes exhibiting kinematic locking or collisions can be selectively regenerated, allowing autonomous correction of degenerate configurations during design. Our graph-based, data-driven methodology surpasses traditional optimization approaches, enabling scalable inverse design that generalizes to mechanisms with arbitrary node counts. We demonstrate successful synthesis of linkage systems containing up to 20 nodes with extensibility to N-node architectures. This work advances autoregressive graph generation methodologies and computational kinematic synthesis, establishing new paradigms for scalable inverse design of complex mechanical systems.

Conclusion: Dynafit为非线性动力系统轨迹分类提供了一种有效的核方法框架，能够学习动力学相似性度量并适应不同应用场景，包括可融入部分先验知识的情况。

Abstract: We address the problem of classifying trajectory data generated by some nonlinear dynamics, where each class corresponds to a distinct dynamical system. We propose Dynafit, a kernel-based method for learning a distance metric between training trajectories and the underlying dynamics. New observations are assigned to the class with the most similar dynamics according to the learned metric. The learning algorithm approximates the Koopman operator which globally linearizes the dynamics in a (potentially infinite) feature space associated with a kernel function. The distance metric is computed in feature space independently of its dimensionality by using the kernel trick common in machine learning. We also show that the kernel function can be tailored to incorporate partial knowledge of the dynamics when available. Dynafit is applicable to various classification tasks involving nonlinear dynamical systems and sensors. We illustrate its effectiveness on three examples: chaos detection with the logistic map, recognition of handwritten dynamics and of visual dynamic textures.

TL;DR: CausalMixFT：一种通过结构因果模型生成合成样本来增强表格基础模型在数据稀缺场景下微调性能的方法，显著提升ROC-AUC并改善验证-测试性能相关性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 表格基础模型在数据稀缺场景下微调面临挑战，因为基于稀缺验证数据的早停往往无法反映真实泛化性能。需要一种能够增强微调鲁棒性和下游性能的方法。

Method: 提出CausalMixFT方法，使用在目标数据集上拟合的结构因果模型生成结构一致的合成样本。通过因果信息增强的合成示例来扩充有限的真实数据，保持特征依赖关系的同时增加训练多样性。

Result: 在TabArena的33个分类数据集和超过2300次微调实验中，CausalMixFT将归一化ROC-AUC中位数从0.10提升到0.12，优于CTGAN、TabEBM和TableAugment等统计生成方法。同时将验证-测试性能相关性差距中位数从0.67缩小到0.30。

Conclusion: 将因果结构纳入数据增强为在低数据场景下微调表格基础模型提供了一条有效且原则性的途径，能够实现更可靠的基于验证的早停，提高微调稳定性。

Abstract: Fine-tuning tabular foundation models (TFMs) under data scarcity is challenging, as early stopping on even scarcer validation data often fails to capture true generalization performance. We propose CausalMixFT, a method that enhances fine-tuning robustness and downstream performance by generating structurally consistent synthetic samples using Structural Causal Models (SCMs) fitted on the target dataset. This approach augments limited real data with causally informed synthetic examples, preserving feature dependencies while expanding training diversity. Evaluated across 33 classification datasets from TabArena and over 2300 fine-tuning runs, our CausalMixFT method consistently improves median normalized ROC-AUC from 0.10 (standard fine-tuning) to 0.12, outperforming purely statistical generators such as CTGAN (-0.01), TabEBM (-0.04), and TableAugment (-0.09). Moreover, it narrows the median validation-test performance correlation gap from 0.67 to 0.30, enabling more reliable validation-based early stopping, a key step toward improving fine-tuning stability under data scarcity. These results demonstrate that incorporating causal structure into data augmentation provides an effective and principled route to fine-tuning tabular foundation models in low-data regimes.

TL;DR: 该研究提出了一种用于白细胞形态分析的联邦学习框架，能够在保护数据隐私的前提下实现跨机构协作训练，提高模型在资源有限医疗环境中的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 在低收入和中等收入国家，自动化血液形态分析可以支持血液学诊断，但对染色变异、成像差异和罕见形态的数据集偏移敏感。由于隐私法规和数据共享限制，建立集中式数据集来捕捉这种多样性往往不可行。

Method: 引入了一个用于白细胞形态分析的联邦学习框架，使机构间能够在无需交换训练数据的情况下进行协作训练。使用来自多个临床站点的血涂片，联邦模型学习鲁棒的、领域不变的表示，同时保持完整的数据隐私。

Result: 在卷积和基于transformer的架构上的评估表明，与集中式训练相比，联邦训练实现了强大的跨站点性能，并提高了对未见机构的泛化能力。

Conclusion: 这些发现强调了联邦学习作为一种实用且保护隐私的方法，用于在资源有限的医疗环境中开发公平、可扩展和可泛化的医学影像AI。

Abstract: Automated blood morphology analysis can support hematological diagnostics in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) but remains sensitive to dataset shifts from staining variability, imaging differences, and rare morphologies. Building centralized datasets to capture this diversity is often infeasible due to privacy regulations and data-sharing restrictions. We introduce a federated learning framework for white blood cell morphology analysis that enables collaborative training across institutions without exchanging training data. Using blood films from multiple clinical sites, our federated models learn robust, domain-invariant representations while preserving complete data privacy. Evaluations across convolutional and transformer-based architectures show that federated training achieves strong cross-site performance and improved generalization to unseen institutions compared to centralized training. These findings highlight federated learning as a practical and privacy-preserving approach for developing equitable, scalable, and generalizable medical imaging AI in resource-limited healthcare environments.

TL;DR: MEDS-OWL：将医疗事件数据标准（MEDS）转化为OWL本体，实现事件型临床数据的语义网表示和RDF转换


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 医疗机器学习面临数据表示不标准化、语义不明确的问题，导致数据集和实验之间的互操作性和可重复性受限。虽然MEDS标准解决了部分问题，但缺乏与语义网生态系统的集成。

Method: 提出MEDS-OWL轻量级OWL本体，提供形式化概念和关系，使MEDS数据集能够表示为RDF图；开发meds2rdf Python转换库，将MEDS事件转化为符合本体的RDF图；在颅内动脉瘤破裂患者护理路径的合成临床数据集上验证方法，使用SHACL约束验证结果图。

Result: MEDS-OWL首个版本包含13个类、10个对象属性、20个数据属性和24个OWL公理。结合meds2rdf工具，能够实现数据向FAIR对齐数据集的转换、溯源感知的发布以及事件型临床数据的互操作性。

Conclusion: 通过将MEDS与语义网连接，这项工作为事件型临床数据提供了可重用的语义层，并为后续基于图的分析建立了坚实基础。

Abstract: The application of machine learning on healthcare data is often hindered by the lack of standardized and semantically explicit representation, leading to limited interoperability and reproducibility across datasets and experiments. The Medical Event Data Standard (MEDS) addresses these issues by introducing a minimal, event-centric data model designed for reproducible machine-learning workflows from health data. However, MEDS is defined as a data-format specification and does not natively provide integration with the Semantic Web ecosystem. In this article, we introduce MEDS-OWL, a lightweight OWL ontology that provides formal concepts and relations to enable representing MEDS datasets as RDF graphs. Additionally, we implemented meds2rdf, a Python conversion library that transforms MEDS events into RDF graphs, ensuring conformance with the ontology. We demonstrate the approach on a synthetic clinical dataset that describes patient care pathways for ruptured intracranial aneurysms and validate the resulting graph using SHACL constraints. The first release of MEDS-OWL comprises 13 classes, 10 object properties, 20 data properties, and 24 OWL axioms. Combined with meds2rdf, it enables data transformation into FAIR-aligned datasets, provenance-aware publishing, and interoperability of event-based clinical data. By bridging MEDS with the Semantic Web, this work contributes a reusable semantic layer for event-based clinical data and establishes a robust foundation for subsequent graph-based analytics.
