TL;DR: 研究通过驾驶模拟器实验分析自动驾驶车辆中的风险感知，发现动态驾驶风格和行人交互会增加不适感，面部表情识别不可靠，但基于车辆运动和皮肤电导的神经网络模型能有效预测风险感知。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 信任和安全感对公众接受自动驾驶车辆至关重要，需要理解风险感知机制以提升用户体验和安全性。

Method: 使用驾驶模拟器进行实验，32名参与者体验两种自动驾驶风格（冷静vs动态）和行人横穿场景，收集主观舒适度评分、运动数据、面部表情、皮肤电导、心率和眼动数据。

Result: 动态驾驶风格引起更强不适感，行人横穿使动态风格的不适感加倍；面部表情识别不可靠（仅9/24人有反应，8人显示快乐表情）；基于车辆运动和皮肤电导的神经网络模型能有效预测风险感知。

Conclusion: 面部表情识别不适合评估自动驾驶风险感知，但生理信号和运动数据结合的神经网络模型为客观风险评估提供了有效方法，减少了主观偏差。

Abstract: Trust and perceived safety play a crucial role in the public acceptance of
automated vehicles. To understand perceived risk, an experiment was conducted
using a driving simulator under two automated driving styles and optionally
introducing a crossing pedestrian. Data was collected from 32 participants,
consisting of continuous subjective comfort ratings, motion, webcam footage for
facial expression, skin conductance, heart rate, and eye tracking. The
continuous subjective perceived risk ratings showed significant discomfort
associated with perceived risk during cornering and braking followed by relief
or even positive comfort on continuing the ride. The dynamic driving style
induced a stronger discomfort as compared to the calm driving style. The
crossing pedestrian did not affect discomfort with the calm driving style but
doubled the comfort decrement with the dynamic driving style. This illustrates
the importance of consequences of critical interactions in risk perception.
Facial expression was successfully analyzed for 24 participants but most
(15/24) did not show any detectable facial reaction to the critical event.
Among the 9 participants who did, 8 showed a Happy expression, and only 4
showed a Surprise expression. Fear was never dominant. This indicates that
facial expression recognition is not a reliable method for assessing perceived
risk in automated vehicles. To predict perceived risk a neural network model
was implemented using vehicle motion and skin conductance. The model correlated
well with reported perceived risk, demonstrating its potential for objective
perceived risk assessment in automated vehicles, reducing subjective bias and
highlighting areas for future research.

### [2] [PromptEnhancer: A Simple Approach to Enhance Text-to-Image Models via Chain-of-Thought Prompt Rewriting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04545)
*Linqing Wang,Ximing Xing,Yiji Cheng,Zhiyuan Zhao,Jiale Tao,Qixun Wang,Ruihuang Li,Xin Li,Mingrui Wu,Xinchi Deng,Chunyu Wang,Qinglin Lu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: PromptEnhancer是一个通用的提示词重写框架，通过强化学习训练思维链重写器，显著提升文本到图像生成模型对复杂提示词的理解能力，无需修改模型权重。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的文本到图像扩散模型在处理复杂用户提示时经常出现属性绑定、否定和组合关系方面的失败，导致用户意图与生成结果之间存在显著不匹配。

Method: 提出PromptEnhancer框架，通过强化学习训练思维链重写器，使用专门的AlignEvaluator奖励模型提供细粒度反馈，基于24个关键点的系统分类法来优化提示词重写。

Result: 在HunyuanImage 2.1模型上的大量实验表明，PromptEnhancer在各种语义和组合挑战中显著提高了图像-文本对齐质量。

Conclusion: 该框架能够生成更精确的提示词，有效提升文本到图像模型的性能，同时引入了新的人类偏好基准来促进未来研究。

Abstract: Recent advancements in text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have demonstrated
remarkable capabilities in generating high-fidelity images. However, these
models often struggle to faithfully render complex user prompts, particularly
in aspects like attribute binding, negation, and compositional relationships.
This leads to a significant mismatch between user intent and the generated
output. To address this challenge, we introduce PromptEnhancer, a novel and
universal prompt rewriting framework that enhances any pretrained T2I model
without requiring modifications to its weights. Unlike prior methods that rely
on model-specific fine-tuning or implicit reward signals like image-reward
scores, our framework decouples the rewriter from the generator. We achieve
this by training a Chain-of-Thought (CoT) rewriter through reinforcement
learning, guided by a dedicated reward model we term the AlignEvaluator. The
AlignEvaluator is trained to provide explicit and fine-grained feedback based
on a systematic taxonomy of 24 key points, which are derived from a
comprehensive analysis of common T2I failure modes. By optimizing the CoT
rewriter to maximize the reward from our AlignEvaluator, our framework learns
to generate prompts that are more precisely interpreted by T2I models.
Extensive experiments on the HunyuanImage 2.1 model demonstrate that
PromptEnhancer significantly improves image-text alignment across a wide range
of semantic and compositional challenges. Furthermore, we introduce a new,
high-quality human preference benchmark to facilitate future research in this
direction.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: UniPic2-SD3.5M-Kontext是一个2B参数的DiT模型，通过架构改进和大规模预训练，结合创新的渐进式双任务强化策略，在图像生成和编辑任务上超越了更大参数量的模型，并扩展到统一的多模态框架。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的开源多模态模型过于注重参数规模扩展而忽视训练策略优化，限制了效率和性能。需要开发更高效的训练方法来提升模型能力。

Method: 基于SD3.5-Medium进行架构修改和大规模高质量数据预训练，提出渐进式双任务强化策略(PDTR)分阶段增强指令跟随和编辑一致性，最后通过连接器与Qwen2.5-VL-7B联合训练构建统一多模态模型。

Result: UniPic2-SD3.5M-Kontext在图像生成和编辑能力上超越了BAGEL(7B)和Flux-Kontext(12B)等更大参数模型，验证了训练策略的有效性。UniPic2-Metaquery在多种任务上达到顶级性能。

Conclusion: 提出的Skywork UniPic 2.0训练范式具有有效性和通用性，通过优化的训练策略而非单纯参数扩展，实现了高性能的多模态理解和生成能力。

Abstract: Recent advances in multimodal models have demonstrated impressive
capabilities in unified image generation and editing. However, many prominent
open-source models prioritize scaling model parameters over optimizing training
strategies, limiting their efficiency and performance. In this work, we present
UniPic2-SD3.5M-Kontext, a 2B-parameter DiT model based on SD3.5-Medium, which
achieves state-of-the-art image generation and editing while extending
seamlessly into a unified multimodal framework. Our approach begins with
architectural modifications to SD3.5-Medium and large-scale pre-training on
high-quality data, enabling joint text-to-image generation and editing
capabilities. To enhance instruction following and editing consistency, we
propose a novel Progressive Dual-Task Reinforcement strategy (PDTR), which
effectively strengthens both tasks in a staged manner. We empirically validate
that the reinforcement phases for different tasks are mutually beneficial and
do not induce negative interference. After pre-training and reinforcement
strategies, UniPic2-SD3.5M-Kontext demonstrates stronger image generation and
editing capabilities than models with significantly larger generation
parameters-including BAGEL (7B) and Flux-Kontext (12B). Furthermore, following
the MetaQuery, we connect the UniPic2-SD3.5M-Kontext and Qwen2.5-VL-7B via a
connector and perform joint training to launch a unified multimodal model
UniPic2-Metaquery. UniPic2-Metaquery integrates understanding, generation, and
editing, achieving top-tier performance across diverse tasks with a simple and
scalable training paradigm. This consistently validates the effectiveness and
generalizability of our proposed training paradigm, which we formalize as
Skywork UniPic 2.0.

### [4] [Inpaint4Drag: Repurposing Inpainting Models for Drag-Based Image Editing via Bidirectional Warping](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04582)
*Jingyi Lu,Kai Han*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Inpaint4Drag是一个基于拖拽的图像编辑框架，通过像素空间双向扭曲和图像修复实现实时编辑，解决了现有方法精度低、反馈延迟和模型依赖的问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有基于生成模型潜在空间操作的拖拽编辑方法存在精度有限、反馈延迟和模型特定约束的问题，需要一种更直接高效的编辑方案

Method: 将拖拽编辑分解为像素空间双向扭曲和图像修复两个步骤，将图像区域视为可变形材料，实现实时扭曲预览(0.01秒)和高效修复(0.3秒)

Result: 在512x512分辨率下实现实时性能，相比需要数分钟编辑的现有方法显著提升交互体验，同时获得优异的视觉质量和精确控制

Conclusion: 该方法作为通用适配器，无需修改架构即可兼容任何修复模型，自动继承修复技术的未来改进，为拖拽式图像编辑提供了高效实用的解决方案

Abstract: Drag-based image editing has emerged as a powerful paradigm for intuitive
image manipulation. However, existing approaches predominantly rely on
manipulating the latent space of generative models, leading to limited
precision, delayed feedback, and model-specific constraints. Accordingly, we
present Inpaint4Drag, a novel framework that decomposes drag-based editing into
pixel-space bidirectional warping and image inpainting. Inspired by elastic
object deformation in the physical world, we treat image regions as deformable
materials that maintain natural shape under user manipulation. Our method
achieves real-time warping previews (0.01s) and efficient inpainting (0.3s) at
512x512 resolution, significantly improving the interaction experience compared
to existing methods that require minutes per edit. By transforming drag inputs
directly into standard inpainting formats, our approach serves as a universal
adapter for any inpainting model without architecture modification,
automatically inheriting all future improvements in inpainting technology.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves superior visual
quality and precise control while maintaining real-time performance. Project

### [5] [DisPatch: Disarming Adversarial Patches in Object Detection with Diffusion Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04597)
*Jin Ma,Mohammed Aldeen,Christopher Salas,Feng Luo,Mashrur Chowdhury,Mert Pesé,Long Cheng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: DISPATCH是一个基于扩散模型的物体检测防御框架，采用"再生与修正"策略来对抗对抗性补丁攻击，无需先验知识即可有效防御多种攻击类型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的物体检测器容易受到对抗性补丁攻击，这些攻击可以隐藏真实物体或创建虚假物体，造成严重后果。需要一种有效、通用且能抵抗自适应攻击的防御方法。

Method: 利用扩散模型的生成能力重新生成整个图像，使其与良性数据对齐，然后通过修正过程识别并替换对抗性区域为重新生成的良性对应部分。

Result: 在多种检测器和攻击上实验表明，DISPATCH在隐藏攻击上达到89.3%的mAP.5分数，在非目标创建攻击上将攻击成功率降低到24.8%，且对自适应攻击保持强鲁棒性。

Conclusion: DISPATCH是一种实用可靠的物体检测系统防御方法，具有攻击无关性，无需先验知识，在多种攻击场景下均优于现有最先进防御方法。

Abstract: Object detection is fundamental to various real-world applications, such as
security monitoring and surveillance video analysis. Despite their
advancements, state-of-theart object detectors are still vulnerable to
adversarial patch attacks, which can be easily applied to real-world objects to
either conceal actual items or create non-existent ones, leading to severe
consequences. Given the current diversity of adversarial patch attacks and
potential unknown threats, an ideal defense method should be effective,
generalizable, and robust against adaptive attacks. In this work, we introduce
DISPATCH, the first diffusion-based defense framework for object detection.
Unlike previous works that aim to "detect and remove" adversarial patches,
DISPATCH adopts a "regenerate and rectify" strategy, leveraging generative
models to disarm attack effects while preserving the integrity of the input
image. Specifically, we utilize the in-distribution generative power of
diffusion models to regenerate the entire image, aligning it with benign data.
A rectification process is then employed to identify and replace adversarial
regions with their regenerated benign counterparts. DISPATCH is attack-agnostic
and requires no prior knowledge of the existing patches. Extensive experiments
across multiple detectors and attacks demonstrate that DISPATCH consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art defenses on both hiding attacks and creating
attacks, achieving the best overall mAP.5 score of 89.3% on hiding attacks, and
lowering the attack success rate to 24.8% on untargeted creating attacks.
Moreover, it maintains strong robustness against adaptive attacks, making it a
practical and reliable defense for object detection systems.

### [6] [WATCH: World-aware Allied Trajectory and pose reconstruction for Camera and Human](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04600)
*Qijun Ying,Zhongyuan Hu,Rui Zhang,Ronghui Li,Yu Lu,Zijiao Zeng*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: WATCH是一个统一的框架，通过分析性航向角分解技术和世界模型启发的相机轨迹整合机制，解决了从单目视频重建全局人体运动中的相机方向信息利用不足和相机平移线索整合无效的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 从野外单目视频重建全局人体运动在VR、图形和机器人应用中需求日益增长，但面临深度模糊、运动模糊以及相机与人体运动纠缠等挑战。现有以人体运动为中心的方法在利用相机方向信息和整合相机平移线索方面存在不足。

Method: 提出WATCH框架，包含分析性航向角分解技术（相比现有几何方法具有更好的效率和可扩展性）和受世界模型启发的相机轨迹整合机制（提供超越简单硬解码方法的有效途径）。

Result: 在野外基准测试中，WATCH在端到端轨迹重建方面实现了最先进的性能。

Conclusion: 该工作证明了联合建模相机-人体运动关系的有效性，并为解决相机平移整合这一长期挑战提供了新的见解。

Abstract: Global human motion reconstruction from in-the-wild monocular videos is
increasingly demanded across VR, graphics, and robotics applications, yet
requires accurate mapping of human poses from camera to world coordinates-a
task challenged by depth ambiguity, motion ambiguity, and the entanglement
between camera and human movements. While human-motion-centric approaches excel
in preserving motion details and physical plausibility, they suffer from two
critical limitations: insufficient exploitation of camera orientation
information and ineffective integration of camera translation cues. We present
WATCH (World-aware Allied Trajectory and pose reconstruction for Camera and
Human), a unified framework addressing both challenges. Our approach introduces
an analytical heading angle decomposition technique that offers superior
efficiency and extensibility compared to existing geometric methods.
Additionally, we design a camera trajectory integration mechanism inspired by
world models, providing an effective pathway for leveraging camera translation
information beyond naive hard-decoding approaches. Through experiments on
in-the-wild benchmarks, WATCH achieves state-of-the-art performance in
end-to-end trajectory reconstruction. Our work demonstrates the effectiveness
of jointly modeling camera-human motion relationships and offers new insights
for addressing the long-standing challenge of camera translation integration in
global human motion reconstruction. The code will be available publicly.

### [7] [Sali4Vid: Saliency-Aware Video Reweighting and Adaptive Caption Retrieval for Dense Video Captioning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04602)
*MinJu Jeon,Si-Woo Kim,Ye-Chan Kim,HyunGee Kim,Dong-Jin Kim*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: Sali4Vid是一个用于密集视频字幕生成的显著性感知框架，通过视频重加权和自适应字幕检索解决现有方法的局限性，在YouCook2和ViTT数据集上达到SOTA效果


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有端到端密集视频字幕模型的两个局限性：(1)仅对文本应用时间戳监督，平等对待所有视频帧；(2)从固定大小的视频块中检索字幕，忽略了场景转换

Method: 提出Sali4Vid框架，包含两个核心组件：1)显著性感知视频重加权-将时间戳标注转换为基于sigmoid的帧重要性权重；2)基于语义的自适应字幕检索-通过帧相似性分割视频以捕捉场景转换并改进字幕检索

Result: 在YouCook2和ViTT数据集上取得了最先进的结果

Conclusion: 联合改进视频加权和检索对密集视频字幕生成有益，Sali4Vid是一个简单而有效的解决方案

Abstract: Dense video captioning aims to temporally localize events in video and
generate captions for each event. While recent works propose end-to-end models,
they suffer from two limitations: (1) applying timestamp supervision only to
text while treating all video frames equally, and (2) retrieving captions from
fixed-size video chunks, overlooking scene transitions. To address these, we
propose Sali4Vid, a simple yet effective saliency-aware framework. We introduce
Saliency-aware Video Reweighting, which converts timestamp annotations into
sigmoid-based frame importance weights, and Semantic-based Adaptive Caption
Retrieval, which segments videos by frame similarity to capture scene
transitions and improve caption retrieval. Sali4Vid achieves state-of-the-art
results on YouCook2 and ViTT, demonstrating the benefit of jointly improving
video weighting and retrieval for dense video captioning

Abstract: Traffic congestion and violations pose significant challenges for urban
mobility and road safety. Traditional traffic monitoring systems, such as fixed
cameras and sensor-based methods, are often constrained by limited coverage,
low adaptability, and poor scalability. To address these challenges, this paper
introduces an advanced unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-based traffic surveillance
system capable of accurate vehicle detection, classification, tracking, and
behavioral analysis in real-world, unconstrained urban environments. The system
leverages multi-scale and multi-angle template matching, Kalman filtering, and
homography-based calibration to process aerial video data collected from
altitudes of approximately 200 meters. A case study in urban area demonstrates
robust performance, achieving a detection precision of 91.8%, an F1-score of
90.5%, and tracking metrics (MOTA/MOTP) of 92.1% and 93.7%, respectively.
Beyond precise detection, the system classifies five vehicle types and
automatically detects critical traffic violations, including unsafe lane
changes, illegal double parking, and crosswalk obstructions, through the fusion
of geofencing, motion filtering, and trajectory deviation analysis. The
integrated analytics module supports origin-destination tracking, vehicle count
visualization, inter-class correlation analysis, and heatmap-based congestion
modeling. Additionally, the system enables entry-exit trajectory profiling,
vehicle density estimation across road segments, and movement direction
logging, supporting comprehensive multi-scale urban mobility analytics.
Experimental results confirms the system's scalability, accuracy, and practical
relevance, highlighting its potential as an enforcement-aware,
infrastructure-independent traffic monitoring solution for next-generation
smart cities.

### [9] [VCMamba: Bridging Convolutions with Multi-Directional Mamba for Efficient Visual Representation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04669)
*Mustafa Munir,Alex Zhang,Radu Marculescu*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: VCMamba是一个新颖的视觉骨干网络，结合了CNN的局部特征提取能力和多向Mamba SSM的全局建模能力，在ImageNet和ADE20K上取得了优异性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: ViT和SSM在全局上下文建模方面表现出色，但缺乏CNN的细粒度局部特征提取能力；CNN虽然擅长局部特征但缺乏全局推理能力。需要结合两者的优势

Method: 采用卷积stem和分层结构，早期阶段使用卷积块提取局部特征，后期阶段使用多向Mamba块建模长距离依赖和全局上下文，保持线性复杂度

Result: VCMamba-B在ImageNet-1K达到82.6% top-1准确率，比PlainMamba-L3高0.3%且参数少37%；在ADE20K获得47.1 mIoU，比EfficientFormer-L7高2.0 mIoU且参数少62%

Conclusion: VCMamba成功整合了CNN和Mamba SSM的优势，在保持线性复杂度的同时实现了优异的性能，为视觉骨干网络设计提供了新思路

Abstract: Recent advances in Vision Transformers (ViTs) and State Space Models (SSMs)
have challenged the dominance of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) in
computer vision. ViTs excel at capturing global context, and SSMs like Mamba
offer linear complexity for long sequences, yet they do not capture
fine-grained local features as effectively as CNNs. Conversely, CNNs possess
strong inductive biases for local features but lack the global reasoning
capabilities of transformers and Mamba. To bridge this gap, we introduce
\textit{VCMamba}, a novel vision backbone that integrates the strengths of CNNs
and multi-directional Mamba SSMs. VCMamba employs a convolutional stem and a
hierarchical structure with convolutional blocks in its early stages to extract
rich local features. These convolutional blocks are then processed by later
stages incorporating multi-directional Mamba blocks designed to efficiently
model long-range dependencies and global context. This hybrid design allows for
superior feature representation while maintaining linear complexity with
respect to image resolution. We demonstrate VCMamba's effectiveness through
extensive experiments on ImageNet-1K classification and ADE20K semantic
segmentation. Our VCMamba-B achieves 82.6% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K,
surpassing PlainMamba-L3 by 0.3% with 37% fewer parameters, and outperforming
Vision GNN-B by 0.3% with 64% fewer parameters. Furthermore, VCMamba-B obtains
47.1 mIoU on ADE20K, exceeding EfficientFormer-L7 by 2.0 mIoU while utilizing
62% fewer parameters. Code is available at
https://github.com/Wertyuui345/VCMamba.

*Vanshika Vats,Ashwani Rathee,James Davis*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 提出多智能体训练免费框架，通过Worker-Supervisor迭代架构协调视觉语言模型，确保语义分割结果严格遵循复杂的文本标注指南


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现实应用中的语义分割不仅需要准确的分割掩码，还必须严格遵守复杂的文本标注指南。传统方法需要昂贵的任务特定重新训练，而现有的开放词汇分割方法在处理段落长度的复杂指南时表现不佳

Method: 多智能体训练免费框架，包含Worker执行分割、Supervisor根据检索到的指南进行批判，以及轻量级强化学习停止策略来决定何时终止迭代循环

Result: 在Waymo和ReasonSeg数据集上评估，该方法显著优于最先进的基线方法，展示了强大的泛化能力和指令遵循能力

Conclusion: 该框架能够有效解决复杂标注指南的遵循问题，在保证分割质量的同时平衡计算资源使用，为现实应用中的语义分割提供了实用解决方案

Abstract: Semantic segmentation in real-world applications often requires not only
accurate masks but also strict adherence to textual labeling guidelines. These
guidelines are typically complex and long, and both human and automated
labeling often fail to follow them faithfully. Traditional approaches depend on
expensive task-specific retraining that must be repeated as the guidelines
evolve. Although recent open-vocabulary segmentation methods excel with simple
prompts, they often fail when confronted with sets of paragraph-length
guidelines that specify intricate segmentation rules. To address this, we
introduce a multi-agent, training-free framework that coordinates
general-purpose vision-language models within an iterative Worker-Supervisor
refinement architecture. The Worker performs the segmentation, the Supervisor
critiques it against the retrieved guidelines, and a lightweight reinforcement
learning stop policy decides when to terminate the loop, ensuring
guideline-consistent masks while balancing resource use. Evaluated on the Waymo
and ReasonSeg datasets, our method notably outperforms state-of-the-art
baselines, demonstrating strong generalization and instruction adherence.

### [11] [Domain Adaptation for Different Sensor Configurations in 3D Object Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04711)
*Satoshi Tanaka,Kok Seang Tan,Isamu Yamashita*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 该论文针对不同LiDAR传感器配置导致的3D目标检测性能下降问题，提出了下游微调和部分层微调两种技术，有效提升了跨配置的泛化能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 不同车辆平台使用不同的LiDAR传感器配置，导致点云分布差异，使得在一个配置上训练的模型在其他配置上性能下降。现有研究主要关注环境域差距和单一LiDAR内的密度变化，而不同传感器配置间的域差距研究较少。

Method: 提出了两种技术：1）下游微调 - 在多数据集训练后进行数据集特定的微调；2）部分层微调 - 只更新部分层以提高跨配置泛化能力。使用同一地理区域采集的多个传感器配置配对数据集进行实验。

Result: 联合训练结合下游微调和部分层微调的方法，在每种配置上都持续优于简单的联合训练方法。

Conclusion: 该研究为将3D目标检测模型适配到多样化车辆平台提供了实用且可扩展的解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in autonomous driving have underscored the importance of
accurate 3D object detection, with LiDAR playing a central role due to its
robustness under diverse visibility conditions. However, different vehicle
platforms often deploy distinct sensor configurations, causing performance
degradation when models trained on one configuration are applied to another
because of shifts in the point cloud distribution. Prior work on multi-dataset
training and domain adaptation for 3D object detection has largely addressed
environmental domain gaps and density variation within a single LiDAR; in
contrast, the domain gap for different sensor configurations remains largely
unexplored. In this work, we address domain adaptation across different sensor
configurations in 3D object detection. We propose two techniques: Downstream
Fine-tuning (dataset-specific fine-tuning after multi-dataset training) and
Partial Layer Fine-tuning (updating only a subset of layers to improve
cross-configuration generalization). Using paired datasets collected in the
same geographic region with multiple sensor configurations, we show that joint
training with Downstream Fine-tuning and Partial Layer Fine-tuning consistently
outperforms naive joint training for each configuration. Our findings provide a
practical and scalable solution for adapting 3D object detection models to the
diverse vehicle platforms.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 基于卷积神经网络和Mamba状态空间模型的混合网络CD-Mamba，用于遮蓝远感图像中的云层检测，同时捕捉短程空间相关性和长程大气相似性，提高检测准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 远感图像常被云层遮蓝，影响数据完整性和可靠性。云层检测需要同时处理短程空间冗余和长程大气相似性。

Method: 提出CD-Mamba混合模型，统一集成卷积操作和Mamba状态空间模型。该模型能够全面捕捉像素级细节和长期片段依赖关系，同时处理像素级交互和大范围片段依赖。

Result: 大量实验验证了CD-Mamba的有效性，并证明其在云层检测任务上超越了现有方法的性能。

Conclusion: CD-Mamba通过结合卷积神经网络的局部空间依赖性捕捉能力和Mamba的长程依赖性建模能力，成功实现了高效的多空间尺度云层检测，为远感图像云遮问题提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Remote sensing images are frequently obscured by cloud cover, posing
significant challenges to data integrity and reliability. Effective cloud
detection requires addressing both short-range spatial redundancies and
long-range atmospheric similarities among cloud patches. Convolutional neural
networks are effective at capturing local spatial dependencies, while Mamba has
strong capabilities in modeling long-range dependencies. To fully leverage both
local spatial relations and long-range dependencies, we propose CD-Mamba, a
hybrid model that integrates convolution and Mamba's state-space modeling into
a unified cloud detection network. CD-Mamba is designed to comprehensively
capture pixelwise textural details and long term patchwise dependencies for
cloud detection. This design enables CD-Mamba to manage both pixel-wise
interactions and extensive patch-wise dependencies simultaneously, improving
detection accuracy across diverse spatial scales. Extensive experiments
validate the effectiveness of CD-Mamba and demonstrate its superior performance
over existing methods.

multiple classes, while obtaining full annotations for all classes is often
impractical due to the time and labor required. Leveraging partially labeled
datasets (PLDs) presents a promising alternative; however, current VMIS
approaches face significant class imbalance due to the unequal category
distribution in PLDs. Existing methods attempt to address this by generating
pseudo-full labels. Nevertheless, these typically require additional models and
often result in potential performance degradation from label noise. In this
work, we introduce a Task Consistency Training (TCT) framework to address class
imbalance without requiring extra models. TCT includes a backbone network with
a main segmentation head (MSH) for multi-channel predictions and multiple
auxiliary task heads (ATHs) for task-specific predictions. By enforcing a
consistency constraint between the MSH and ATH predictions, TCT effectively
utilizes unlabeled anatomical structures. To avoid error propagation from
low-consistency, potentially noisy data, we propose a filtering strategy to
exclude such data. Additionally, we introduce a unified auxiliary
uncertainty-weighted loss (UAUWL) to mitigate segmentation quality declines
caused by the dominance of specific tasks. Extensive experiments on eight
abdominal datasets from diverse clinical sites demonstrate our approach's
effectiveness.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: SAM和SAM2在恶劣天气条件下表现不佳，本文通过两种不确定性量化方法提升自动驾驶场景分割的鲁棒性：多步微调SAM2引入不确定性损失函数，以及适配医疗影像的UAT方法到驾驶场景。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视觉基础模型在视觉模糊性高的恶劣天气条件下缺乏不确定性量化，影响自动驾驶的安全性，需要借鉴医疗影像中不确定性感知训练的成功经验。

Method: 1) 多步微调SAM2，将不确定性指标直接整合到损失函数中；2) 将医疗影像分割中的不确定性感知适配器(UAT)适配到驾驶场景。

Result: 在CamVid、BDD100K和GTA驾驶数据集上的实验表明，UAT-SAM在极端天气下优于标准SAM，带有不确定性感知损失的SAM2在多样化驾驶场景中表现更佳。

Conclusion: 显式的不确定性建模对于安全关键的自动驾驶在挑战性环境中具有重要价值，两种方法都有效提升了分割鲁棒性。

Abstract: Recent advances in vision foundation models, such as the Segment Anything
Model (SAM) and its successor SAM2, have achieved state-of-the-art performance
on general image segmentation benchmarks. However, these models struggle in
adverse weather conditions where visual ambiguity is high, largely due to their
lack of uncertainty quantification. Inspired by progress in medical imaging,
where uncertainty-aware training has improved reliability in ambiguous cases,
we investigate two approaches to enhance segmentation robustness for autonomous
driving. First, we introduce a multi-step finetuning procedure for SAM2 that
incorporates uncertainty metrics directly into the loss function, improving
overall scene recognition. Second, we adapt the Uncertainty-Aware Adapter
(UAT), originally designed for medical image segmentation, to driving contexts.
We evaluate both methods on CamVid, BDD100K, and GTA driving datasets.
Experiments show that UAT-SAM outperforms standard SAM in extreme weather,
while SAM2 with uncertainty-aware loss achieves improved performance across
diverse driving scenes. These findings underscore the value of explicit
uncertainty modeling for safety-critical autonomous driving in challenging
environments.

Abstract: Despite advances in practical and multimodal fine-grained Human Activity
Recognition (HAR), a system that runs entirely on smartwatches in unconstrained
environments remains elusive. We present WatchHAR, an audio and inertial-based
HAR system that operates fully on smartwatches, addressing privacy and latency
issues associated with external data processing. By optimizing each component

maintaining over 90% accuracy across more than 25 activity classes. WatchHAR
outperforms state-of-the-art models for event detection and activity
classification while running directly on the smartwatch, achieving 9.3 ms
processing time for activity event detection and 11.8 ms for multimodal

realizing smartwatches' potential as standalone, privacy-aware, and

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: MCANet是一个多标签分类框架，通过多尺度特征学习和类别特定的残差注意力机制，显著提升了飓风后无人机图像损坏评估的准确性和可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有CNN方法难以捕捉多尺度空间特征，且难以区分视觉相似或共现的损坏类型，这限制了飓风后快速准确损坏评估的能力。

Method: 提出MCANet框架：使用Res2Net分层骨干网络丰富多尺度空间上下文；采用多头类别特定残差注意力模块，每个注意力分支关注不同空间粒度；结合局部细节和全局上下文。

Result: 在RescueNet数据集（4,494张无人机图像）上达到91.75%的mAP，优于多个基准模型；使用8个注意力头时性能提升至92.35%，对Road Blocked等困难类别的AP提升超过6%。

Conclusion: MCANet能够准确定位损坏相关区域，支持可解释性，可用于灾后风险制图、应急路由和数字孪生灾害响应。未来可集成灾害知识图谱和多模态大语言模型提升适应性。

Abstract: Rapid and accurate post-hurricane damage assessment is vital for disaster
response and recovery. Yet existing CNN-based methods struggle to capture
multi-scale spatial features and to distinguish visually similar or
co-occurring damage types. To address these issues, we propose MCANet, a
multi-label classification framework that learns multi-scale representations
and adaptively attends to spatially relevant regions for each damage category.
MCANet employs a Res2Net-based hierarchical backbone to enrich spatial context
across scales and a multi-head class-specific residual attention module to
enhance discrimination. Each attention branch focuses on different spatial
granularities, balancing local detail with global context. We evaluate MCANet
on the RescueNet dataset of 4,494 UAV images collected after Hurricane Michael.
MCANet achieves a mean average precision (mAP) of 91.75%, outperforming ResNet,
Res2Net, VGG, MobileNet, EfficientNet, and ViT. With eight attention heads,
performance further improves to 92.35%, boosting average precision for
challenging classes such as Road Blocked by over 6%. Class activation mapping
confirms MCANet's ability to localize damage-relevant regions, supporting
interpretability. Outputs from MCANet can inform post-disaster risk mapping,
emergency routing, and digital twin-based disaster response. Future work could
integrate disaster-specific knowledge graphs and multimodal large language
models to improve adaptability to unseen disasters and enrich semantic
understanding for real-world decision-making.

Motivation: 传统方法假设视频中人群不变，无法处理动态变化的复杂人群场景，需要结合局部外观特征和全局场景上下文

Method: 使用组检测增强的VLM提取每帧的局部和全局特征，通过图论全局优化来处理时间上的组织一致性

Result: 在公开数据集上超越了现有的最先进人群检测方法

Conclusion: 该方法能够有效检测视频中动态变化的人群，通过VLM特征提取和图论优化实现了更准确的组织检测

Abstract: This paper proposes dynamic human group detection in videos. For detecting
complex groups, not only the local appearance features of in-group members but
also the global context of the scene are important. Such local and global
appearance features in each frame are extracted using a Vision-Language Model
(VLM) augmented for group detection in our method. For further improvement, the
group structure should be consistent over time. While previous methods are
stabilized on the assumption that groups are not changed in a video, our method
detects dynamically changing groups by global optimization using a graph with
all frames' groupness probabilities estimated by our groupness-augmented CLIP
features. Our experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms
state-of-the-art group detection methods on public datasets. Code:

Method: 结合GPT-4o基础视觉语言模型的语义推理能力和结构化领域知识图谱，动态识别RGB图像中的参考物体，检索验证高度，估计淹没比例，应用统计异常值过滤计算最终深度值。

Result: 在MyCoast New York的110张众包图像上评估，平均绝对误差为8.17厘米，比GPT-4o基线降低20.5%，优于之前的CNN方法，具有良好的场景泛化能力和近实时操作性能。

Conclusion: FloodVision系统适用于未来集成到数字孪生平台和公民报告应用中，为智慧城市洪水韧性提供支持。

Abstract: Timely and accurate floodwater depth estimation is critical for road
accessibility and emergency response. While recent computer vision methods have
enabled flood detection, they suffer from both accuracy limitations and poor
generalization due to dependence on fixed object detectors and task-specific
training. To enable accurate depth estimation that can generalize across
diverse flood scenarios, this paper presents FloodVision, a zero-shot framework
that combines the semantic reasoning abilities of the foundation
vision-language model GPT-4o with a structured domain knowledge graph. The
knowledge graph encodes canonical real-world dimensions for common urban
objects including vehicles, people, and infrastructure elements to ground the
model's reasoning in physical reality. FloodVision dynamically identifies
visible reference objects in RGB images, retrieves verified heights from the
knowledge graph to mitigate hallucination, estimates submergence ratios, and
applies statistical outlier filtering to compute final depth values. Evaluated
on 110 crowdsourced images from MyCoast New York, FloodVision achieves a mean
absolute error of 8.17 cm, reducing the GPT-4o baseline 10.28 cm by 20.5% and
surpassing prior CNN-based methods. The system generalizes well across varying
scenes and operates in near real-time, making it suitable for future
integration into digital twin platforms and citizen-reporting apps for smart
city flood resilience.

TL;DR: 本文提出了一种新的混合塔框架PIG，通过伪查询生成和细粒度交互，同时实现文本到视频检索的高效果性和高效率。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决现有CLIP基础的两种框架的问题：双塔框架效果性低，单塔框架效率低，需要一种新的混合框架来同时满足效果性和效率需求。

Method: 提出PIG方法，包含伪查询生成器，为每个视频生成伪查询，使得视频特征和文本特征能够在细粒度上交互，类似单塔框架的高效果性，同时在推理阶段不增加额外存储或计算开销。

Result: 在5个常用的文本-视频检索数据集上进行实验，R@1指标提升1.6%∼3.9%，效果显著提升。方法在保持双塔框架效率的同时，达到了接近state-of-the-art的性能。

Conclusion: 混合塔框架PIG能够同时实现高效果性和高效率，为文本到视频检索任务提供了一种有效的解决方案，显示了混合框架的优势。

Abstract: The Text-to-Video Retrieval (T2VR) task aims to retrieve unlabeled videos by
textual queries with the same semantic meanings. Recent CLIP-based approaches
have explored two frameworks: Two-Tower versus Single-Tower framework, yet the
former suffers from low effectiveness, while the latter suffers from low
efficiency. In this study, we explore a new Hybrid-Tower framework that can
hybridize the advantages of the Two-Tower and Single-Tower framework, achieving
high effectiveness and efficiency simultaneously. We propose a novel hybrid
method, Fine-grained Pseudo-query Interaction and Generation for T2VR, ie, PIG,
which includes a new pseudo-query generator designed to generate a pseudo-query
for each video. This enables the video feature and the textual features of
pseudo-query to interact in a fine-grained manner, similar to the Single-Tower
approaches to hold high effectiveness, even before the real textual query is
received. Simultaneously, our method introduces no additional storage or
computational overhead compared to the Two-Tower framework during the inference
stage, thus maintaining high efficiency. Extensive experiments on five commonly
used text-video retrieval benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves a
significant improvement over the baseline, with an increase of $1.6\% \sim
3.9\%$ in R@1. Furthermore, our method matches the efficiency of Two-Tower
models while achieving near state-of-the-art performance, highlighting the
advantages of the Hybrid-Tower framework.

Motivation: 医学MRI图像在切片方向上通常具有较低的空间分辨率，需要高质量的上采样方法来提升图像质量，同时保持解剖细节和纹理信息。

Method: 结合MLP-Mixer和多层感知机与卷积层，构建生成对抗网络进行单维度超分辨率重建，使用MSSEG2数据集进行训练验证。

Result: MLP-SRGAN在多个临床数据集上表现出色，边缘更清晰、模糊更少，纹理和精细解剖细节保持更好，同时参数更少、训练/评估时间更快、模型尺寸更小。

Conclusion: MLP-SRGAN是一种有效的医学图像超分辨率方法，在无参考图像质量指标和传统指标上都优于现有技术，代码已开源。

Abstract: We propose a novel architecture called MLP-SRGAN, which is a single-dimension
Super Resolution Generative Adversarial Network (SRGAN) that utilizes
Multi-Layer Perceptron Mixers (MLP-Mixers) along with convolutional layers to
upsample in the slice direction. MLP-SRGAN is trained and validated using high
resolution (HR) FLAIR MRI from the MSSEG2 challenge dataset. The method was
applied to three multicentre FLAIR datasets (CAIN, ADNI, CCNA) of images with
low spatial resolution in the slice dimension to examine performance on
held-out (unseen) clinical data. Upsampled results are compared to several
state-of-the-art SR networks. For images with high resolution (HR) ground
truths, peak-signal-to-noise-ratio (PSNR) and structural similarity index
(SSIM) are used to measure upsampling performance. Several new structural,
no-reference image quality metrics were proposed to quantify sharpness (edge
strength), noise (entropy), and blurriness (low frequency information) in the
absence of ground truths. Results show MLP-SRGAN results in sharper edges, less
blurring, preserves more texture and fine-anatomical detail, with fewer
parameters, faster training/evaluation time, and smaller model size than
existing methods. Code for MLP-SRGAN training and inference, data generators,
models and no-reference image quality metrics will be available at

Method: 提出预处理流水线（包括地理参考、分辨率对齐、强度归一化等），评估SIFT、ASIFT、AKAZE、RIFT2和SuperGlue五种特征匹配算法在跨模态月球图像对上的性能。

Result: SuperGlue算法一贯表现最优，有最低的均方根误差和最快的运行时间。经典方法在赤道附近表现良好但在极地照明条件下性能下降。

Conclusion: 预处理和基于深度学习的方法对于在多样化条件下实现稳健的月球图像注册至关重要，SuperGlue在跨模态月球图像匹配中显示出最优性能。

Abstract: Accurate image registration is critical for lunar exploration, enabling
surface mapping, resource localization, and mission planning. Aligning data
from diverse lunar sensors -- optical (e.g., Orbital High Resolution Camera,
Narrow and Wide Angle Cameras), hyperspectral (Imaging Infrared Spectrometer),
and radar (e.g., Dual-Frequency Synthetic Aperture Radar, Selene/Kaguya
mission) -- is challenging due to differences in resolution, illumination, and
sensor distortion. We evaluate five feature matching algorithms: SIFT, ASIFT,
AKAZE, RIFT2, and SuperGlue (a deep learning-based matcher), using
cross-modality image pairs from equatorial and polar regions. A preprocessing
pipeline is proposed, including georeferencing, resolution alignment, intensity
normalization, and enhancements like adaptive histogram equalization, principal
component analysis, and shadow correction. SuperGlue consistently yields the
lowest root mean square error and fastest runtimes. Classical methods such as
SIFT and AKAZE perform well near the equator but degrade under polar lighting.
The results highlight the importance of preprocessing and learning-based
approaches for robust lunar image registration across diverse conditions.

Abstract: Skin diseases are among the most prevalent health concerns worldwide, yet
conventional diagnostic methods are often costly, complex, and unavailable in
low-resource settings. Automated classification using deep learning has emerged
as a promising alternative, but existing studies are mostly limited to
dermoscopic datasets and a narrow range of disease classes. In this work, we
curate a large dataset of over 50 skin disease categories captured with mobile
devices, making it more representative of real-world conditions. We evaluate
multiple convolutional neural networks and Transformer-based architectures,
demonstrating that Transformer models, particularly the Swin Transformer,
achieve superior performance by effectively capturing global contextual
features. To enhance interpretability, we incorporate Gradient-weighted Class
Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM), which highlights clinically relevant regions and
provides transparency in model predictions. Our results underscore the
potential of Transformer-based approaches for mobile-acquired skin lesion

Conclusion: 混合专家模型是量化预测不确定性的有效方法，在OOD数据下表现优于传统集成方法，且可通过简单门控和增加专家数量来优化不确定性校准。

Abstract: Estimating accurate and well-calibrated predictive uncertainty is important
for enhancing the reliability of computer vision models, especially in
safety-critical applications like traffic scene perception. While ensemble
methods are commonly used to quantify uncertainty by combining multiple models,
a mixture of experts (MoE) offers an efficient alternative by leveraging a
gating network to dynamically weight expert predictions based on the input.
Building on the promising use of MoEs for semantic segmentation in our previous
works, we show that well-calibrated predictive uncertainty estimates can be
extracted from MoEs without architectural modifications. We investigate three
methods to extract predictive uncertainty estimates: predictive entropy, mutual
information, and expert variance. We evaluate these methods for an MoE with two
experts trained on a semantical split of the A2D2 dataset. Our results show
that MoEs yield more reliable uncertainty estimates than ensembles in terms of
conditional correctness metrics under out-of-distribution (OOD) data.
Additionally, we evaluate routing uncertainty computed via gate entropy and
find that simple gating mechanisms lead to better calibration of routing
uncertainty estimates than more complex classwise gates. Finally, our
experiments on the Cityscapes dataset suggest that increasing the number of
experts can further enhance uncertainty calibration. Our code is available at

Motivation: 现有Mamba方法在光场超分辨率中存在多方向扫描策略效率低下、特征提取冗余的问题，且状态空间在保持空间-角度和视差信息方面存在局限

Method: 提出子空间简单扫描策略(Sub-SS)和子空间简单Mamba块(SSMB)；采用双阶段建模：第一阶段使用空间-角度残差子空间Mamba块(SA-RSMB)进行浅层特征提取，第二阶段使用双分支并行结构结合极平面Mamba块(EPMB)和极平面Transformer块(EPTB)进行深度特征精炼

Result: LFMT在真实和合成光场数据集上显著优于当前最先进方法，在保持低计算复杂度的同时实现了性能的实质性提升

Conclusion: LFMT成功整合了Mamba和Transformer的优势，实现了跨空间、角度和极平面域的全面信息探索，为光场超分辨率提供了高效且性能优异的解决方案

Abstract: Recently, Mamba-based methods, with its advantage in long-range information
modeling and linear complexity, have shown great potential in optimizing both
computational cost and performance of light field image super-resolution
(LFSR). However, current multi-directional scanning strategies lead to
inefficient and redundant feature extraction when applied to complex LF data.
To overcome this challenge, we propose a Subspace Simple Scanning (Sub-SS)
strategy, based on which we design the Subspace Simple Mamba Block (SSMB) to
achieve more efficient and precise feature extraction. Furthermore, we propose
a dual-stage modeling strategy to address the limitation of state space in
preserving spatial-angular and disparity information, thereby enabling a more
comprehensive exploration of non-local spatial-angular correlations.
Specifically, in stage I, we introduce the Spatial-Angular Residual Subspace
Mamba Block (SA-RSMB) for shallow spatial-angular feature extraction; in stage
II, we use a dual-branch parallel structure combining the Epipolar Plane Mamba
Block (EPMB) and Epipolar Plane Transformer Block (EPTB) for deep epipolar
feature refinement. Building upon meticulously designed modules and strategies,
we introduce a hybrid Mamba-Transformer framework, termed LFMT. LFMT integrates
the strengths of Mamba and Transformer models for LFSR, enabling comprehensive
information exploration across spatial, angular, and epipolar-plane domains.
Experimental results demonstrate that LFMT significantly outperforms current
state-of-the-art methods in LFSR, achieving substantial improvements in
performance while maintaining low computational complexity on both real-word
and synthetic LF datasets.

Motivation: 现有端到端视觉定位方法仅依赖指代目标监督，忽略了潜在前景目标的益处，且缺乏多粒度判别能力，难以在复杂场景中稳健识别目标。

Method: 提出PropVG框架，包含对比指代评分(CRS)模块（句子和词汇级对比学习）和多粒度目标判别(MTD)模块（融合对象和语义级信息）。

Result: 在gRefCOCO、Ref-ZOM、R-RefCOCO和RefCOCO等多个基准测试中验证了有效性。

Conclusion: PropVG通过整合proposal生成和指代理解，结合对比学习和多粒度判别，显著提升了视觉定位性能，为复杂场景下的目标识别提供了有效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent advances in visual grounding have largely shifted away from
traditional proposal-based two-stage frameworks due to their inefficiency and
high computational complexity, favoring end-to-end direct reference paradigms.
However, these methods rely exclusively on the referred target for supervision,
overlooking the potential benefits of prominent prospective targets. Moreover,
existing approaches often fail to incorporate multi-granularity discrimination,
which is crucial for robust object identification in complex scenarios. To
address these limitations, we propose PropVG, an end-to-end proposal-based
framework that, to the best of our knowledge, is the first to seamlessly
integrate foreground object proposal generation with referential object
comprehension without requiring additional detectors. Furthermore, we introduce
a Contrastive-based Refer Scoring (CRS) module, which employs contrastive
learning at both sentence and word levels to enhance the capability in
understanding and distinguishing referred objects. Additionally, we design a
Multi-granularity Target Discrimination (MTD) module that fuses object- and
semantic-level information to improve the recognition of absent targets.
Extensive experiments on gRefCOCO (GREC/GRES), Ref-ZOM, R-RefCOCO, and RefCOCO
(REC/RES) benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of PropVG. The codes and

critical for advancing high-speed propulsion technologies. However, the large
scale and high dimensionality of simulation-generated temporal flow field data
present significant challenges for visual interpretation, feature
differentiation, and cross-case comparison. In this paper, we present
TemporalFlowViz, a parameter-aware visual analytics workflow and system
designed to support expert-driven clustering, visualization, and interpretation
of temporal flow fields from scramjet combustion simulations. Our approach
leverages hundreds of simulated combustion cases with varying initial
conditions, each producing time-sequenced flow field images. We use pretrained
Vision Transformers to extract high-dimensional embeddings from these frames,
apply dimensionality reduction and density-based clustering to uncover latent
combustion modes, and construct temporal trajectories in the embedding space to
track the evolution of each simulation over time. To bridge the gap between
latent representations and expert reasoning, domain specialists annotate
representative cluster centroids with descriptive labels. These annotations are
used as contextual prompts for a vision-language model, which generates
natural-language summaries for individual frames and full simulation cases. The
system also supports parameter-based filtering, similarity-based case
retrieval, and coordinated multi-view exploration to facilitate in-depth
analysis. We demonstrate the effectiveness of TemporalFlowViz through two
expert-informed case studies and expert feedback, showing TemporalFlowViz
enhances hypothesis generation, supports interpretable pattern discovery, and
enhances knowledge discovery in large-scale scramjet combustion analysis.

TL;DR: OmniFHT是一个无需姿态信息的3D折射率重建框架，通过傅里叶衍射定理和隐式神经表示，实现了对流动细胞群的高通量断层成像，支持任意几何形状和多轴旋转。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有成像方法假设细胞进行均匀单轴旋转且需要已知每帧姿态，这限制了方法对近球形细胞的适用性，无法准确成像具有复杂旋转的不规则形状细胞，只能分析细胞群的一部分。

Method: 利用傅里叶衍射定理和隐式神经表示(INRs)，通过联合优化每个细胞的未知旋转轨迹和体积结构，在弱散射假设下实现重建。连续表示允许从稀疏采样投影和有限角度覆盖进行准确重建。

Result: OmniFHT能够使用少至10个视图或仅120度角度范围产生高保真结果，首次实现了对整个流动细胞群的原位高通量断层成像。

Conclusion: 该方法为流式细胞术平台提供了可扩展且无偏见的无标记形态计量分析解决方案，突破了现有技术的限制。

Abstract: High-throughput 3D quantitative phase imaging (QPI) in flow cytometry enables
label-free, volumetric characterization of individual cells by reconstructing
their refractive index (RI) distributions from multiple viewing angles during
flow through microfluidic channels. However, current imaging methods assume
that cells undergo uniform, single-axis rotation, which require their poses to
be known at each frame. This assumption restricts applicability to
near-spherical cells and prevents accurate imaging of irregularly shaped cells
with complex rotations. As a result, only a subset of the cellular population
can be analyzed, limiting the ability of flow-based assays to perform robust
statistical analysis. We introduce OmniFHT, a pose-free 3D RI reconstruction
framework that leverages the Fourier diffraction theorem and implicit neural
representations (INRs) for high-throughput flow cytometry tomographic imaging.
By jointly optimizing each cell's unknown rotational trajectory and volumetric
structure under weak scattering assumptions, OmniFHT supports arbitrary cell
geometries and multi-axis rotations. Its continuous representation also allows
accurate reconstruction from sparsely sampled projections and restricted
angular coverage, producing high-fidelity results with as few as 10 views or
only 120 degrees of angular range. OmniFHT enables, for the first time, in
situ, high-throughput tomographic imaging of entire flowing cell populations,
providing a scalable and unbiased solution for label-free morphometric analysis
in flow cytometry platforms.

*Hannah Schieber,Dominik Frischmann,Simon Boche,Victor Schaack,Angela Schoellig,Stefan Leutenegger,Daniel Roth*

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: CoRe-GS是一种用于移动自主空中机器人的语义3D高斯编辑方法，通过粗粒度语义分割和颜色过滤来快速隔离兴趣点，减少约25%的训练时间，同时保持高质量的新视角合成效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 移动自主机器人应用（如远程指导和灾难响应）需要准确的3D重建和快速场景处理。传统方法重建整个场景效率低下，而兴趣点（PoIs）通常在数据采集早期就能检测到，因此需要一种能快速聚焦特定对象的方法。

Method: 提出CoRe-GS方法：首先生成具有语义信息的高斯粗粒度场景，然后使用新颖的基于颜色的有效过滤方法来精炼语义对象，实现有效的对象隔离。这种方法在完整训练周期完成前就能进行语义编辑。

Result: 在两个数据集（SCRREAM真实户外场景和NeRDS 360合成室内场景）上评估，显示运行时间减少，训练时间比完整语义高斯训练周期减少约四分之一，同时新视角合成质量更高。

Conclusion: CoRe-GS成功平衡了高质量重建和减少训练时间的需求，通过语义感知的早期编辑和有效过滤机制，为移动机器人应用提供了快速准确的对象级3D重建解决方案。

Abstract: Mobile reconstruction for autonomous aerial robotics holds strong potential
for critical applications such as tele-guidance and disaster response. These
tasks demand both accurate 3D reconstruction and fast scene processing. Instead
of reconstructing the entire scene in detail, it is often more efficient to
focus on specific objects, i.e., points of interest (PoIs). Mobile robots
equipped with advanced sensing can usually detect these early during data
acquisition or preliminary analysis, reducing the need for full-scene
optimization. Gaussian Splatting (GS) has recently shown promise in delivering
high-quality novel view synthesis and 3D representation by an incremental
learning process. Extending GS with scene editing, semantics adds useful
per-splat features to isolate objects effectively.
  Semantic 3D Gaussian editing can already be achieved before the full training
cycle is completed, reducing the overall training time. Moreover, the
semantically relevant area, the PoI, is usually already known during capturing.
To balance high-quality reconstruction with reduced training time, we propose
CoRe-GS. We first generate a coarse segmentation-ready scene with semantic GS
and then refine it for the semantic object using our novel color-based
effective filtering for effective object isolation. This is speeding up the
training process to be about a quarter less than a full training cycle for
semantic GS. We evaluate our approach on two datasets, SCRREAM (real-world,
outdoor) and NeRDS 360 (synthetic, indoor), showing reduced runtime and higher
novel-view-synthesis quality.

TL;DR: Cryo-RL是一个基于强化学习的冷冻消融针放置规划框架，通过模拟临床环境和奖励函数优化，在583例前列腺癌病例中达到与人类专家相当的性能，且规划时间大幅减少。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前冷冻消融治疗的前列腺癌手术规划依赖人工经验，耗时且质量不稳定，需要自动化解决方案来提高规划效率和一致性。

Method: 将冷冻消融规划建模为马尔可夫决策过程，使用强化学习框架在模拟环境中顺序选择冷冻消融针位置和冰球直径，通过基于肿瘤覆盖率的奖励函数学习最优策略。

Result: 在583例回顾性病例中，Cryo-RL相比最佳几何优化基线方法Dice系数提升超过8个百分点，达到人类专家水平，且规划时间显著减少。

Conclusion: 强化学习能够提供临床可行、可重复且高效的冷冻消融规划方案，具有重要的临床应用潜力。

Abstract: Cryoablation is a minimally invasive localised treatment for prostate cancer
that destroys malignant tissue during de-freezing, while sparing surrounding
healthy structures. Its success depends on accurate preoperative planning of
cryoprobe placements to fully cover the tumour and avoid critical anatomy. This
planning is currently manual, expertise-dependent, and time-consuming, leading
to variability in treatment quality and limited scalability. In this work, we
introduce Cryo-RL, a reinforcement learning framework that models cryoablation
planning as a Markov decision process and learns an optimal policy for
cryoprobe placement. Within a simulated environment that models clinical
constraints and stochastic intraoperative variability, an agent sequentially
selects cryoprobe positions and ice sphere diameters. Guided by a reward
function based on tumour coverage, this agent learns a cryoablation strategy
that leads to optimal cryoprobe placements without the need for any
manually-designed plans. Evaluated on 583 retrospective prostate cancer cases,
Cryo-RL achieved over 8 percentage-point Dice improvements compared with the
best automated baselines, based on geometric optimisation, and matched human
expert performance while requiring substantially less planning time. These
results highlight the potential of reinforcement learning to deliver clinically
viable, reproducible, and efficient cryoablation plans.

TL;DR: 这篇论文研究了预训练计算机视觉模型在自动化恐惧疗法中预测对蜘蛛图片恐惧程度的能力，达到了平均绝对误差10.1-11.0的精度。


<details>

Motivation: 为开发基于情感响应的自适应性疗法系统，需要确定计算机视觉模型能否准确预测对蜘蛛图片的恐惧程度。

Method: 使用转移学习适配三个预训练计算机视觉模型，在313张标准化图片数据集上预测0-100分刻度的恐惧评分，采用交叉验证评估性能。

Result: 模型平均MAE在10.1-11.0之间，学习曲线分析显示数据集大小影响性能，解释性评估证明模型基于蜘蛛相关特征做出预测。

Conclusion: 证明了可解释计算机视觉模型在预测恐惧评分方面的潜力，强调了模型可解释性和足够数据集对开发有效情感感知疗法技术的重要性。

Abstract: Advances in computer vision have opened new avenues for clinical
applications, particularly in computerized exposure therapy where visual
stimuli can be dynamically adjusted based on patient responses. As a critical
step toward such adaptive systems, we investigated whether pretrained computer
vision models can accurately predict fear levels from spider-related images. We
adapted three diverse models using transfer learning to predict human fear
ratings (on a 0-100 scale) from a standardized dataset of 313 images. The
models were evaluated using cross-validation, achieving an average mean
absolute error (MAE) between 10.1 and 11.0. Our learning curve analysis
revealed that reducing the dataset size significantly harmed performance,
though further increases yielded no substantial gains. Explainability
assessments showed the models' predictions were based on spider-related
features. A category-wise error analysis further identified visual conditions
associated with higher errors (e.g., distant views and artificial/painted
spiders). These findings demonstrate the potential of explainable computer
vision models in predicting fear ratings, highlighting the importance of both
model explainability and a sufficient dataset size for developing effective
emotion-aware therapeutic technologies.

Motivation: 工业磨损检测对预测性维护很重要，但真实数据采集成本高且耗时，缺乏不同磨损场景的数据集

Method: 结合视觉语言模型和3D仿真渲染引擎，生成不同锈蚀条件的合成数据来训练计算机视觉模型

Result: 使用合成数据训练的锈蚀检测模型在真实图像测试中表现优异，mAP50达到0.87，优于其他方法

Conclusion: 该方法可定制且易于扩展到其他工业磨损检测场景，为解决数据稀缺问题提供了有效方案

Abstract: We propose an approach to generate synthetic data to train computer vision
(CV) models for industrial wear and tear detection. Wear and tear detection is
an important CV problem for predictive maintenance tasks in any industry.
However, data curation for training such models is expensive and time-consuming
due to the unavailability of datasets for different wear and tear scenarios.
Our approach employs a vision language model along with a 3D simulation and
rendering engine to generate synthetic data for varying rust conditions. We
evaluate our approach by training a CV model for rust detection using the
generated dataset and tested the trained model on real images of rusted
industrial objects. The model trained with the synthetic data generated by our
approach, outperforms the other approaches with a mAP50 score of 0.87. The
approach is customizable and can be easily extended to other industrial wear
and tear detection scenarios

TL;DR: 这篇论文提出了一种简单的注意力基础多实例学习框架，用于自动化计数皮腺细胞中的脂谴滴，对比了基线MLP模型和注意力MIL模型的性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 手动计数皮腺细胞中的脂谴滴非常耗时且主观，需要自动化解决方案来提高效率和准确性。

Method: 使用Nile Red染色的皮腺细胞图像，分为14个类别，通过数据增广扩展到约50,000个细胞。对比基线MLP模型和注意力基础MIL模型，使用五折交叉验证。

Result: 基线MLP模型表现更稳定（平均MAE=5.6），而注意力MIL模型不太一致（平均MAE=10.7）但在某些折叠中更优。

Conclusion: 简单的集合级聚合方法提供了健壮的基线，注意力MIL需要任务对齐池化和正则化才能充分发挥潜力。

Abstract: Sebocytes are lipid-secreting cells whose differentiation is marked by the
accumulation of intracellular lipid droplets, making their quantification a key
readout in sebocyte biology. Manual counting is labor-intensive and subjective,
motivating automated solutions. Here, we introduce a simple attention-based
multiple instance learning (MIL) framework for sebocyte image analysis. Nile
Red-stained sebocyte images were annotated into 14 classes according to droplet
counts, expanded via data augmentation to about 50,000 cells. Two models were
benchmarked: a baseline multi-layer perceptron (MLP) trained on aggregated
patch-level counts, and an attention-based MIL model leveraging ResNet-50
features with instance weighting. Experiments using five-fold cross-validation
showed that the baseline MLP achieved more stable performance (mean MAE = 5.6)
compared with the attention-based MIL, which was less consistent (mean MAE =
10.7) but occasionally superior in specific folds. These findings indicate that
simple bag-level aggregation provides a robust baseline for slide-level droplet
counting, while attention-based MIL requires task-aligned pooling and
regularization to fully realize its potential in sebocyte image analysis.

TL;DR: UniView是一种新颖的单图像新视角合成方法，通过检索相似物体的参考图像提供强先验信息，解决了传统方法在未观察区域生成时的严重失真问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 单图像新视角合成任务高度不适定，现有方法往往基于模糊先验和输入视图附近的插值来生成未见区域，导致严重失真。

Method: 构建检索和增强系统，利用多模态大语言模型选择合适参考图像；引入即插即用适配器模块和多级隔离层动态生成目标视图的参考特征；设计解耦三重注意力机制来保持原始输入图像细节。

Result: 大量实验表明，UniView显著提升了新视角合成性能，在具有挑战性的数据集上优于最先进的方法。

Conclusion: 通过利用相似物体的参考图像提供强先验信息，UniView有效解决了单图像新视角合成中的失真问题，取得了优异的性能表现。

Abstract: The task of synthesizing novel views from a single image is highly ill-posed
due to multiple explanations for unobserved areas. Most current methods tend to
generate unseen regions from ambiguity priors and interpolation near input
views, which often lead to severe distortions. To address this limitation, we
propose a novel model dubbed as UniView, which can leverage reference images
from a similar object to provide strong prior information during view
synthesis. More specifically, we construct a retrieval and augmentation system
and employ a multimodal large language model (MLLM) to assist in selecting
reference images that meet our requirements. Additionally, a plug-and-play
adapter module with multi-level isolation layers is introduced to dynamically
generate reference features for the target views. Moreover, in order to
preserve the details of an original input image, we design a decoupled triple
attention mechanism, which can effectively align and integrate multi-branch
features into the synthesis process. Extensive experiments have demonstrated
that our UniView significantly improves novel view synthesis performance and
outperforms state-of-the-art methods on the challenging datasets.

TL;DR: MFM-Mapper通过融合双视觉编码器特征和使用GPT-2作为映射器，显著提升了视频到音频生成的训练效率和性能，仅需之前方法16%的训练量就能达到竞争性结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有视频到音频生成方法训练成本高，需要利用基础模型的跨模态知识转移能力。之前的工作使用轻量级映射器连接预训练视觉编码器和文本到音频模型，但仍有改进空间。

Method: 提出MFM-Mapper方法：1）使用双视觉编码器融合更丰富的语义和时间特征；2）用GPT-2替换线性映射器，将跨模态特征映射类比为自回归翻译任务，改善特征对齐。

Result: MFM-Mapper展现出卓越的训练效率，仅需之前基于映射器方法16%的训练规模，就能在语义和时间一致性方面获得更好性能，与更大规模训练的模型竞争。

Conclusion: MFM-Mapper通过双编码器特征融合和GPT-2映射器的创新设计，有效提升了视频到音频生成的效率和性能，为资源密集型任务提供了高效解决方案。

Abstract: Recent Video-to-Audio (V2A) generation relies on extracting semantic and
temporal features from video to condition generative models. Training these
models from scratch is resource intensive. Consequently, leveraging foundation
models (FMs) has gained traction due to their cross-modal knowledge transfer
and generalization capabilities. One prior work has explored fine-tuning a
lightweight mapper network to connect a pre-trained visual encoder with a
text-to-audio generation model for V2A. Inspired by this, we introduce the
Multiple Foundation Model Mapper (MFM-Mapper). Compared to the previous mapper
approach, MFM-Mapper benefits from richer semantic and temporal information by
fusing features from dual visual encoders. Furthermore, by replacing a linear
mapper with GPT-2, MFM-Mapper improves feature alignment, drawing parallels
between cross-modal features mapping and autoregressive translation tasks. Our
MFM-Mapper exhibits remarkable training efficiency. It achieves better
performance in semantic and temporal consistency with fewer training consuming,
requiring only 16\% of the training scale compared to previous mapper-based
work, yet achieves competitive performance with models trained on a much larger
scale.

Method: 结合视觉语言模型进行退化感知，设计引导频率模态特定提取模块进行频域退化抑制，以及引导空间模态聚合融合模块进行跨模态退化过滤和特征聚合

Result: 在双源退化场景下取得了优于现有算法和策略的融合性能

Conclusion: GD^2Fusion框架有效解决了双源退化场景下的图像融合问题，实现了端到端的联合优化

Abstract: Most existing infrared-visible image fusion (IVIF) methods assume
high-quality inputs, and therefore struggle to handle dual-source degraded
scenarios, typically requiring manual selection and sequential application of
multiple pre-enhancement steps. This decoupled pre-enhancement-to-fusion
pipeline inevitably leads to error accumulation and performance degradation. To
overcome these limitations, we propose Guided Dual-Domain Fusion (GD^2Fusion),
a novel framework that synergistically integrates vision-language models (VLMs)
for degradation perception with dual-domain (frequency/spatial) joint
optimization. Concretely, the designed Guided Frequency Modality-Specific
Extraction (GFMSE) module performs frequency-domain degradation perception and
suppression and discriminatively extracts fusion-relevant sub-band features.
Meanwhile, the Guided Spatial Modality-Aggregated Fusion (GSMAF) module carries
out cross-modal degradation filtering and adaptive multi-source feature
aggregation in the spatial domain to enhance modality complementarity and
structural consistency. Extensive qualitative and quantitative experiments
demonstrate that GD^2Fusion achieves superior fusion performance compared with
existing algorithms and strategies in dual-source degraded scenarios. The code
will be publicly released after acceptance of this paper.

Abstract: Breast cancer remains a leading cause of cancer-related mortality among women
worldwide. Ultrasound imaging, widely used due to its safety and
cost-effectiveness, plays a key role in early detection, especially in patients
with dense breast tissue. This paper presents a comprehensive study on the
application of machine learning and deep learning techniques for breast cancer
classification using ultrasound images. Using datasets such as BUSI, BUS-BRA,
and BrEaST-Lesions USG, we evaluate classical machine learning models (SVM,
KNN) and deep convolutional neural networks (ResNet-18, EfficientNet-B0,
GoogLeNet). Experimental results show that ResNet-18 achieves the highest

models, though outperformed by CNNs, achieve competitive performance when
enhanced with deep feature extraction. Grad-CAM visualizations further improve
model transparency by highlighting diagnostically relevant image regions. These
findings support the integration of AI-based diagnostic tools into clinical
workflows and demonstrate the feasibility of deploying high-performing,

Conclusion: SLVM框架在低光照交通场景感知中表现出色，计算开销低，为相关研究提供了高质量数据集和有效解决方案。

Abstract: Fast and accurate object perception in low-light traffic scenes has attracted
increasing attention. However, due to severe illumination degradation and the
lack of reliable visual cues, existing perception models and methods struggle
to quickly adapt to and accurately predict in low-light environments. Moreover,
there is the absence of available large-scale benchmark specifically focused on
low-light traffic scenes. To bridge this gap, we introduce a physically
grounded illumination degradation method tailored to real-world low-light
settings and construct Dark-traffic, the largest densely annotated dataset to
date for low-light traffic scenes, supporting object detection, instance
segmentation, and optical flow estimation. We further propose the Separable
Learning Vision Model (SLVM), a biologically inspired framework designed to
enhance perception under adverse lighting. SLVM integrates four key components:
a light-adaptive pupillary mechanism for illumination-sensitive feature
extraction, a feature-level separable learning strategy for efficient
representation, task-specific decoupled branches for multi-task separable
learning, and a spatial misalignment-aware fusion module for precise
multi-feature alignment. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SLVM achieves
state-of-the-art performance with reduced computational overhead. Notably, it
outperforms RT-DETR by 11.2 percentage points in detection, YOLOv12 by 6.1
percentage points in instance segmentation, and reduces endpoint error (EPE) of
baseline by 12.37% on Dark-traffic. On the LIS benchmark, the end-to-end
trained SLVM surpasses Swin Transformer+EnlightenGAN and
ConvNeXt-T+EnlightenGAN by an average of 11 percentage points across key
metrics, and exceeds Mask RCNN (with light enhancement) by 3.1 percentage
points. The Dark-traffic dataset and complete code is released at

Abstract: The study explores the integration of transfer learning (TL) with

computational requirements and dataset scarcity, this research evaluates three
TL strategies--full fine-tuning, partial fine-tuning, and training from

ShuffleNet. Experiments were conducted on three benchmark datasets: AHCD,
HIJJA, and IFHCDB. MobileNet emerged as the top-performing model, consistently
achieving superior accuracy, robustness, and efficiency, with ShuffleNet
excelling in generalization, particularly under full fine-tuning. The IFHCDB
dataset yielded the highest results, with 99% accuracy using MnasNet under full
fine-tuning, highlighting its suitability for robust character recognition. The
AHCD dataset achieved competitive accuracy (97%) with ShuffleNet, while HIJJA
posed significant challenges due to its variability, achieving a peak accuracy
of 92% with ShuffleNet. Notably, full fine-tuning demonstrated the best overall
performance, balancing accuracy and convergence speed, while partial
fine-tuning underperformed across metrics. These findings underscore the
potential of combining TL and MbNets for resource-efficient AHCR, paving the
way for further optimizations and broader applications. Future work will

posed humanoid characters. To address the challenge of aligning complex
garments with arbitrary and highly diverse body shapes, we use SMPL as a proxy
representation and separate the clothing-to-body draping problem into two
correspondence tasks: 1) clothing-to-SMPL and 2) body-to-SMPL correspondence,
where each has its unique challenges. While we address the clothing-to-SMPL
fitting problem using a geometric learning-based approach for
partial-to-complete shape correspondence prediction, we introduce a diffusion
model-based approach for body-to-SMPL correspondence using multi-view
consistent appearance features and a pre-trained 2D foundation model. Our
method can handle complex geometries, non-manifold meshes, and generalizes
effectively to a wide range of humanoid characters -- including humans, robots,
cartoon subjects, creatures, and aliens, while maintaining computational
efficiency for practical adoption. In addition to offering a fully automatic
fitting solution, LUIVITON supports fast customization of clothing size,
allowing users to adjust clothing sizes and material properties after they have
been draped. We show that our system can produce high-quality 3D clothing
fittings without any human labor, even when 2D clothing sewing patterns are not
available.

TL;DR: ADClick是一个用于工业异常检测的交互式图像分割算法，通过少量用户点击和文本描述生成像素级异常标注，显著提升异常检测模型性能。ADClick-Seg通过跨模态框架将视觉特征与文本提示对齐，在MVTec AD数据集上达到最先进水平。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 工业产品检测通常只使用正常样本训练异常检测模型，虽然可以收集缺陷样本，但需要像素级标注限制了可扩展性。需要一种能够高效生成精确标注的方法来提升异常检测性能。

Method: 提出ADClick交互式图像分割算法，通过少量用户点击和简短文本描述生成像素级异常标注。进一步开发ADClick-Seg跨模态框架，通过基于原型的方法对齐视觉特征和文本提示，结合像素级先验和语言引导线索。

Result: ADClick在MVTec AD上达到AP=96.1%的优异性能。ADClick-Seg在多类异常检测任务上取得AP=80.0%、PRO=97.5%、Pixel-AUROC=99.1%的state-of-the-art结果。

Conclusion: ADClick和ADClick-Seg通过交互式分割和跨模态对齐，有效解决了工业异常检测中标注困难的问题，显著提升了检测性能，为工业质检提供了高效精确的解决方案。

Abstract: Industrial product inspection is often performed using Anomaly Detection (AD)
frameworks trained solely on non-defective samples. Although defective samples
can be collected during production, leveraging them usually requires
pixel-level annotations, limiting scalability. To address this, we propose
ADClick, an Interactive Image Segmentation (IIS) algorithm for industrial
anomaly detection. ADClick generates pixel-wise anomaly annotations from only a
few user clicks and a brief textual description, enabling precise and efficient
labeling that significantly improves AD model performance (e.g., AP = 96.1\% on
MVTec AD). We further introduce ADClick-Seg, a cross-modal framework that
aligns visual features and textual prompts via a prototype-based approach for
anomaly detection and localization. By combining pixel-level priors with
language-guided cues, ADClick-Seg achieves state-of-the-art results on the
challenging ``Multi-class'' AD task (AP = 80.0\%, PRO = 97.5\%, Pixel-AUROC =
99.1\% on MVTec AD).

Abstract: Background: To systematically review and perform a meta-analysis of
artificial intelligence (AI)-driven methods for detecting and correcting
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) motion artifacts, assessing current
developments, effectiveness, challenges, and future research directions.
Methods: A comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted,
focusing on deep learning (DL) approaches, particularly generative models, for
the detection and correction of MRI motion artifacts. Quantitative data were
extracted regarding utilized datasets, DL architectures, and performance
metrics. Results: DL, particularly generative models, show promise for reducing
motion artifacts and improving image quality; however, limited
generalizability, reliance on paired training data, and risk of visual
distortions remain key challenges that motivate standardized datasets and
reporting. Conclusions: AI-driven methods, particularly DL generative models,
show significant potential for improving MRI image quality by effectively
addressing motion artifacts. However, critical challenges must be addressed,
including the need for comprehensive public datasets, standardized reporting
protocols for artifact levels, and more advanced, adaptable DL techniques to
reduce reliance on extensive paired datasets. Addressing these aspects could
substantially enhance MRI diagnostic accuracy, reduce healthcare costs, and
improve patient care outcomes.

Motivation: 现有的几何先验方法主要使用低阶几何信息（如法向量），且通过噪声敏感方法估计不可靠。需要更鲁棒的几何约束来改进高斯溅射优化

Method: 提出GeoSplat框架：1）基于主曲率初始化高斯尺度；2）基于局部流形等几何结构引入高效且抗噪声的估计方法；3）在整个训练流程中利用动态几何先验

Result: 在多个数据集上的新颖视图合成实验中，GeoSplat显著提升了高斯溅射的性能，超越了之前的基线方法

Conclusion: GeoSplat通过引入高阶几何约束和鲁棒的估计方法，为高斯溅射提供了有效的几何正则化，证明了几何先验在3D重建中的重要性

Abstract: A few recent works explored incorporating geometric priors to regularize the
optimization of Gaussian splatting, further improving its performance. However,
those early studies mainly focused on the use of low-order geometric priors
(e.g., normal vector), and they are also unreliably estimated by
noise-sensitive methods, like local principal component analysis. To address
their limitations, we first present GeoSplat, a general geometry-constrained
optimization framework that exploits both first-order and second-order
geometric quantities to improve the entire training pipeline of Gaussian
splatting, including Gaussian initialization, gradient update, and
densification. As an example, we initialize the scales of 3D Gaussian
primitives in terms of principal curvatures, leading to a better coverage of
the object surface than random initialization. Secondly, based on certain
geometric structures (e.g., local manifold), we introduce efficient and
noise-robust estimation methods that provide dynamic geometric priors for our
framework. We conduct extensive experiments on multiple datasets for novel view
synthesis, showing that our framework: GeoSplat, significantly improves the
performance of Gaussian splatting and outperforms previous baselines.

Abstract: The classification of 3D point clouds is crucial for applications such as
autonomous driving, robotics, and augmented reality. However, the commonly used
ModelNet40 dataset suffers from limitations such as inconsistent labeling, 2D
data, size mismatches, and inadequate class differentiation, which hinder model
performance. This paper introduces ModelNet-R, a meticulously refined version
of ModelNet40 designed to address these issues and serve as a more reliable
benchmark. Additionally, this paper proposes Point-SkipNet, a lightweight
graph-based neural network that leverages efficient sampling, neighborhood
grouping, and skip connections to achieve high classification accuracy with
reduced computational overhead. Extensive experiments demonstrate that models
trained in ModelNet-R exhibit significant performance improvements. Notably,
Point-SkipNet achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on ModelNet-R with a
substantially lower parameter count compared to contemporary models. This
research highlights the crucial role of dataset quality in optimizing model
efficiency for 3D point cloud classification. For more details, see the code

TL;DR: 该文章提出了一种新的混合深度学习模型SIT，结合CNN的特征提取能力和Transformer的关系建模能力，通过显式建模多尺度特征之间的相互作用，在自动面部美学预测任务上创造了新的最高水准。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统CNN模型在图像处理中通常以固定尺度处理信息，容易忽略不同粒度级别特征之间的关键相互作用，而面部美学评估正需要考虑这种复杂的多尺度特征组合。

Method: 提出Scale-Interaction Transformer (SIT)混合网络结构：首先使用并行卷积的多尺度模块提取不同感受野下的面部特征，然后将这些多尺度表征构造为序列并通过Transformer编码器的自注意力机制显式建模它们之间的相互作用和上下文关系。

Result: 在SCUT-FBP5500标准数据集上进行实验，SIT模型达到了0.9187的Pearson相关系数，超越了之前的所有方法，创造了新的state-of-the-art结果。

Conclusion: 显式建模多尺度视觉线索之间的相互作用对于高性能面部美学预测至关重要，SIT模型的成功显示了混合CNN-Transformer模型在需要全局上下文理解的复杂图像回归任务中的潜力。

Abstract: Automated Facial Beauty Prediction (FBP) is a challenging computer vision
task due to the complex interplay of local and global facial features that
influence human perception. While Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) excel at
feature extraction, they often process information at a fixed scale,
potentially overlooking the critical inter-dependencies between features at
different levels of granularity. To address this limitation, we introduce the
Scale-Interaction Transformer (SIT), a novel hybrid deep learning architecture
that synergizes the feature extraction power of CNNs with the relational
modeling capabilities of Transformers. The SIT first employs a multi-scale
module with parallel convolutions to capture facial characteristics at varying
receptive fields. These multi-scale representations are then framed as a
sequence and processed by a Transformer encoder, which explicitly models their
interactions and contextual relationships via a self-attention mechanism. We
conduct extensive experiments on the widely-used SCUT-FBP5500 benchmark
dataset, where the proposed SIT model establishes a new state-of-the-art. It
achieves a Pearson Correlation of 0.9187, outperforming previous methods. Our
findings demonstrate that explicitly modeling the interplay between multi-scale
visual cues is crucial for high-performance FBP. The success of the SIT
architecture highlights the potential of hybrid CNN-Transformer models for
complex image regression tasks that demand a holistic, context-aware
understanding.

Main category: cs.CV

TL;DR: 使用稀疏专家混合层增强CNN对抗性鲁棒性，在ResNet架构中插入MoE层并结合对抗训练，可在不增加推理成本的情况下提升模型对PGD和AutoPGD攻击的鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统CNN对抗对抗性攻击的鲁棒性改进往往需要资源密集型的防御措施，需要探索更高效的鲁棒性增强方法。

Method: 在ResNet架构的深层阶段插入稀疏专家混合层，结合对抗训练，使用switch loss进行专家平衡，分析路由崩溃现象对鲁棒性的影响。

Result: 单个MoE层的插入带来鲁棒性的一致提升，switch loss导致路由集中在少数专家上，意外使这些路径更加鲁棒，某些专家个体的鲁棒性甚至超过整个门控MoE模型。

Conclusion: 稀疏MoE层是提升CNN对抗性鲁棒性的有效方法，专家专业化产生了鲁棒子路径，为高效鲁棒模型设计提供了新思路。

Abstract: Robustifying convolutional neural networks (CNNs) against adversarial attacks
remains challenging and often requires resource-intensive countermeasures. We
explore the use of sparse mixture-of-experts (MoE) layers to improve robustness
by replacing selected residual blocks or convolutional layers, thereby
increasing model capacity without additional inference cost. On ResNet
architectures trained on CIFAR-100, we find that inserting a single MoE layer
in the deeper stages leads to consistent improvements in robustness under PGD
and AutoPGD attacks when combined with adversarial training. Furthermore, we
discover that when switch loss is used for balancing, it causes routing to
collapse onto a small set of overused experts, thereby concentrating
adversarial training on these paths and inadvertently making them more robust.
As a result, some individual experts outperform the gated MoE model in
robustness, suggesting that robust subpaths emerge through specialization. Our
code is available at https://github.com/KASTEL-MobilityLab/robust-sparse-moes.

Abstract: The ability to compose learned concepts and apply them in novel settings is
key to human intelligence, but remains a persistent limitation in
state-of-the-art machine learning models. To address this issue, we introduce
COGITAO, a modular and extensible data generation framework and benchmark
designed to systematically study compositionality and generalization in visual
domains. Drawing inspiration from ARC-AGI's problem-setting, COGITAO constructs
rule-based tasks which apply a set of transformations to objects in grid-like
environments. It supports composition, at adjustable depth, over a set of 28
interoperable transformations, along with extensive control over grid
parametrization and object properties. This flexibility enables the creation of
millions of unique task rules -- surpassing concurrent datasets by several
orders of magnitude -- across a wide range of difficulties, while allowing
virtually unlimited sample generation per rule. We provide baseline experiments
using state-of-the-art vision models, highlighting their consistent failures to
generalize to novel combinations of familiar elements, despite strong in-domain
performance. COGITAO is fully open-sourced, including all code and datasets, to
support continued research in this field.

Result: 在两个神经科学数据集上，RMSE提升达9%；相比四个最先进的源自由域适应模型，性能提升超过3%

Conclusion: CRAFT是生物学和医学中普遍存在的回归任务的高效源自由半监督深度迁移方法

Abstract: Deep learning models deployed in real-world applications (e.g., medicine)
face challenges because source models do not generalize well to domain-shifted
target data. Many successful domain adaptation (DA) approaches require full
access to source data. Yet, such requirements are unrealistic in scenarios
where source data cannot be shared either because of privacy concerns or
because it is too large and incurs prohibitive storage or computational costs.
Moreover, resource constraints may limit the availability of labeled targets.
We illustrate this challenge in a neuroscience setting where source data are
unavailable, labeled target data are meager, and predictions involve
continuous-valued outputs. We build upon Contradistinguisher (CUDA), an
efficient framework that learns a shared model across the labeled source and
unlabeled target samples, without intermediate representation alignment. Yet,
CUDA was designed for unsupervised DA, with full access to source data, and for
classification tasks. We develop CRAFT -- a Contradistinguisher-based
Regularization Approach for Flexible Training -- for source-free (SF),
semi-supervised transfer of pretrained models in regression tasks. We showcase
the efficacy of CRAFT in two neuroscience settings: gaze prediction with
electroencephalography (EEG) data and ``brain age'' prediction with structural
MRI data. For both datasets, CRAFT yielded up to 9% improvement in
root-mean-squared error (RMSE) over fine-tuned models when labeled training
examples were scarce. Moreover, CRAFT leveraged unlabeled target data and
outperformed four competing state-of-the-art source-free domain adaptation
models by more than 3%. Lastly, we demonstrate the efficacy of CRAFT on two
other real-world regression benchmarks. We propose CRAFT as an efficient
approach for source-free, semi-supervised deep transfer for regression that is
ubiquitous in biology and medicine.

Conclusion: 该方法具有可扩展性、高质量和可控性，适用于实际的3D内容创建应用

Abstract: High-quality textures are critical for realistic 3D content creation, yet
existing generative methods are slow, rely on UV maps, and often fail to remain
faithful to a reference image. To address these challenges, we propose a
transformer-based framework that predicts a 3D texture field directly from a
single image and a mesh, eliminating the need for UV mapping and differentiable
rendering, and enabling faster texture generation. Our method integrates a
triplane representation with depth-based backprojection losses, enabling
efficient training and faster inference. Once trained, it generates
high-fidelity textures in a single forward pass, requiring only 0.2s per shape.
Extensive qualitative, quantitative, and user preference evaluations
demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on
single-image texture reconstruction in terms of both fidelity to the input
image and perceptual quality, highlighting its practicality for scalable,
high-quality, and controllable 3D content creation.

maintain a global camera token pool, which enhances the reliability of camera
pose estimation without sacrificing efficiency. These designs enable WinT3R to
achieve state-of-the-art performance in terms of online reconstruction quality,
camera pose estimation, and reconstruction speed, as validated by extensive
experiments on diverse datasets. Code and model are publicly available at

Motivation: 现有的基于2D到3D提升的3D实例分割方法由于提升过程中的累积误差、模糊语义引导和深度约束不足，难以产生精确的实例级分割结果。

Conclusion: SGS-3D作为一种训练免费的精炼方法，通过联合融合语义和几何信息，有效解决了2D到3D提升方法中的分割精度问题，为高质量3D场景理解提供了可靠的实例分割解决方案。

Abstract: Accurate 3D instance segmentation is crucial for high-quality scene
understanding in the 3D vision domain. However, 3D instance segmentation based
on 2D-to-3D lifting approaches struggle to produce precise instance-level
segmentation, due to accumulated errors introduced during the lifting process
from ambiguous semantic guidance and insufficient depth constraints. To tackle
these challenges, we propose splitting and growing reliable semantic mask for
high-fidelity 3D instance segmentation (SGS-3D), a novel "split-then-grow"
framework that first purifies and splits ambiguous lifted masks using geometric
primitives, and then grows them into complete instances within the scene.
Unlike existing approaches that directly rely on raw lifted masks and sacrifice
segmentation accuracy, SGS-3D serves as a training-free refinement method that
jointly fuses semantic and geometric information, enabling effective
cooperation between the two levels of representation. Specifically, for
semantic guidance, we introduce a mask filtering strategy that leverages the
co-occurrence of 3D geometry primitives to identify and remove ambiguous masks,
thereby ensuring more reliable semantic consistency with the 3D object
instances. For the geometric refinement, we construct fine-grained object
instances by exploiting both spatial continuity and high-level features,
particularly in the case of semantic ambiguity between distinct objects.
Experimental results on ScanNet200, ScanNet++, and KITTI-360 demonstrate that
SGS-3D substantially improves segmentation accuracy and robustness against
inaccurate masks from pre-trained models, yielding high-fidelity object
instances while maintaining strong generalization across diverse indoor and
outdoor environments. Code is available in the supplementary materials.

Abstract: Sign language recognition (SLR) is a machine learning task aiming to identify
signs in videos. Due to the scarcity of annotated data, unsupervised methods
like contrastive learning have become promising in this field. They learn
meaningful representations by pulling positive pairs (two augmented versions of
the same instance) closer and pushing negative pairs (different from the
positive pairs) apart. In SLR, in a sign video, only certain parts provide
information that is truly useful for its recognition. Applying contrastive
methods to SLR raises two issues: (i) contrastive learning methods treat all
parts of a video in the same way, without taking into account the relevance of
certain parts over others; (ii) shared movements between different signs make
negative pairs highly similar, complicating sign discrimination. These issues
lead to learning non-discriminative features for sign recognition and poor
results in downstream tasks. In response, this paper proposes a self-supervised
learning framework designed to learn meaningful representations for SLR. This
framework consists of two key components designed to work together: (i) a new
self-supervised approach with free-negative pairs; (ii) a new data augmentation
technique. This approach shows a considerable gain in accuracy compared to
several contrastive and self-supervised methods, across linear evaluation,
semi-supervised learning, and transferability between sign languages.

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at program synthesis, yet their ability to
produce symbolic graphics programs (SGPs) that render into precise visual
content remains underexplored. We study symbolic graphics programming, where
the goal is to generate an SGP from a natural-language description. This task
also serves as a lens into how LLMs understand the visual world by prompting
them to generate images rendered from SGPs. Among various SGPs, our paper
sticks to scalable vector graphics (SVGs). We begin by examining the extent to
which LLMs can generate SGPs. To this end, we introduce SGP-GenBench, a
comprehensive benchmark covering object fidelity, scene fidelity, and
compositionality (attribute binding, spatial relations, numeracy). On
SGP-GenBench, we discover that frontier proprietary models substantially
outperform open-source models, and performance correlates well with general
coding capabilities. Motivated by this gap, we aim to improve LLMs' ability to
generate SGPs. We propose a reinforcement learning (RL) with verifiable rewards
approach, where a format-validity gate ensures renderable SVG, and a
cross-modal reward aligns text and the rendered image via strong vision
encoders (e.g., SigLIP for text-image and DINO for image-image). Applied to
Qwen-2.5-7B, our method substantially improves SVG generation quality and
semantics, achieving performance on par with frontier systems. We further
analyze training dynamics, showing that RL induces (i) finer decomposition of
objects into controllable primitives and (ii) contextual details that improve
scene coherence. Our results demonstrate that symbolic graphics programming
offers a precise and interpretable lens on cross-modal grounding.

TL;DR: 采用量子中心统计距离测量的Q-SafeML方法，为量子机器学习提供安全监控，处理概念漏淀问题


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 量子机器学习(QML)在安全关键系统中的应用增多，但现有的经典安全监控方法不适用于QML，需要专门的安全机制

Method: 基于SafeML方法进行改进，采用量子中心的距离测量来评估模型准确性，从模型依赖的后分类评估方式替代原有的数据集驱动方式

Result: 在QCNN和VQC模型上进行实验，Q-SafeML能够检测运行数据与训练数据间的距离，处理概念漏淀问题

Conclusion: Q-SafeML提供了量子机器学习的安全监控方案，增强了系统透明度和安全性，支持人类监督

Abstract: The rise of machine learning in safety-critical systems has paralleled
advancements in quantum computing, leading to the emerging field of Quantum
Machine Learning (QML). While safety monitoring has progressed in classical ML,
existing methods are not directly applicable to QML due to fundamental
differences in quantum computation. Given the novelty of QML, dedicated safety
mechanisms remain underdeveloped. This paper introduces Q-SafeML, a safety
monitoring approach for QML. The method builds on SafeML, a recent method that
utilizes statistical distance measures to assess model accuracy and provide
confidence in the reasoning of an algorithm. An adapted version of Q-SafeML
incorporates quantum-centric distance measures, aligning with the probabilistic
nature of QML outputs. This shift to a model-dependent, post-classification
evaluation represents a key departure from classical SafeML, which is
dataset-driven and classifier-agnostic. The distinction is motivated by the
unique representational constraints of quantum systems, requiring distance
metrics defined over quantum state spaces. Q-SafeML detects distances between
operational and training data addressing the concept drifts in the context of
QML. Experiments on QCNN and VQC Models show that this enables informed human
oversight, enhancing system transparency and safety.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 通过实例自适应采样框架构建简洁且信息丰富的训练数据集，提高逆问题学习的样本效率


<details>

Motivation: 传统学习方法需要大量训练样本来学习通用的逆向映射，当先验分布内在维度高或需要高精度时，数据收集成本明显增加

Method: 动态分配采样努力基于具体测试实例，通过迭代精炼条件于最新预测的训练数据集，为每个测试实例量身定制数据集

Conclusion: 该自适应采样策略具有广泛适用性，可扩展到其他逆问题，为传统固定数据集训练提供了可扩展的实用替代方案

Abstract: We propose an instance-wise adaptive sampling framework for constructing
compact and informative training datasets for supervised learning of inverse
problem solutions. Typical learning-based approaches aim to learn a
general-purpose inverse map from datasets drawn from a prior distribution, with
the training process independent of the specific test instance. When the prior
has a high intrinsic dimension or when high accuracy of the learned solution is
required, a large number of training samples may be needed, resulting in
substantial data collection costs. In contrast, our method dynamically
allocates sampling effort based on the specific test instance, enabling
significant gains in sample efficiency. By iteratively refining the training
dataset conditioned on the latest prediction, the proposed strategy tailors the
dataset to the geometry of the inverse map around each test instance. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in the inverse scattering problem
under two types of structured priors. Our results show that the advantage of
the adaptive method becomes more pronounced in settings with more complex
priors or higher accuracy requirements. While our experiments focus on a
particular inverse problem, the adaptive sampling strategy is broadly
applicable and readily extends to other inverse problems, offering a scalable
and practical alternative to conventional fixed-dataset training regimes.

Abstract: Deep Learning is evolving fast and integrates into various domains. Finance
is a challenging field for deep learning, especially in the case of
interpretable artificial intelligence (AI). Although classical approaches
perform very well with natural language processing, computer vision, and
forecasting, they are not perfect for the financial world, in which specialists
use different metrics to evaluate model performance.
  We first introduce financially grounded loss functions derived from key
quantitative finance metrics, including the Sharpe ratio, Profit-and-Loss
(PnL), and Maximum Draw down. Additionally, we propose turnover regularization,
a method that inherently constrains the turnover of generated positions within
predefined limits.
  Our findings demonstrate that the proposed loss functions, in conjunction
with turnover regularization, outperform the traditional mean squared error
loss for return prediction tasks when evaluated using algorithmic trading
metrics. The study shows that financially grounded metrics enhance predictive
performance in trading strategies and portfolio optimization.

Conclusion: 注意力机制与多项式回归优化过程存在深刻联系，Transformer的表征学习过程实质上是寻找分类任务最优特征的过程。

Abstract: Mechanistic interpretability aims to understand how internal components of
modern machine learning models, such as weights, activations, and layers, give
rise to the model's overall behavior. One particularly opaque mechanism is
attention: despite its central role in transformer models, its mathematical
underpinnings and relationship to concepts like feature polysemanticity,
superposition, and model performance remain poorly understood. This paper
establishes a novel connection between attention mechanisms and multinomial
regression. Specifically, we show that in a fixed multinomial regression
setting, optimizing over latent features yields optimal solutions that align
with the dynamics induced by attention blocks. In other words, the evolution of
representations through a transformer can be interpreted as a trajectory that
recovers the optimal features for classification.

Conclusion: ExIt方法能够训练出在推理时进行多步自我改进的LLM，迭代性能可超越训练时的平均迭代深度，展示了自课程RL在自我改进任务中的有效性

Abstract: Progress in many task domains emerges from repeated revisions to previous
solution attempts. Training agents that can reliably self-improve over such
sequences at inference-time is a natural target for reinforcement learning
(RL), yet the naive approach assumes a fixed maximum iteration depth, which can
be both costly and arbitrary. We present Exploratory Iteration (ExIt), a family
of autocurriculum RL methods that directly exploits the recurrent structure of
self-improvement tasks to train LLMs to perform multi-step self-improvement at
inference-time while only training on the most informative single-step
iterations. ExIt grows a task space by selectively sampling the most
informative intermediate, partial histories encountered during an episode for
continued iteration, treating these starting points as new self-iteration task
instances to train a self-improvement policy. ExIt can further pair with
explicit exploration mechanisms to sustain greater task diversity. Across
several domains, encompassing competition math, multi-turn tool-use, and
machine learning engineering, we demonstrate that ExIt strategies, starting
from either a single or many task instances, can produce policies exhibiting
strong inference-time self-improvement on held-out task instances, and the
ability to iterate towards higher performance over a step budget extending
beyond the average iteration depth encountered during training.

Result: 在13个TDC分类基准测试中，12个任务显著优于单任务基线，预测性能高且模型复杂度低、推理速度快

Conclusion: 量子信息特征和自适应任务加权增强的多任务分子学习具有高效性和有效性

Abstract: Prediction for ADMET (Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion, and
Toxicity) plays a crucial role in drug discovery and development, accelerating
the screening and optimization of new drugs. Existing methods primarily rely on
single-task learning (STL), which often fails to fully exploit the
complementarities between tasks. Besides, it requires more computational
resources while training and inference of each task independently. To address
these issues, we propose a new unified Quantum-enhanced and task-Weighted
Multi-Task Learning (QW-MTL) framework, specifically designed for ADMET
classification tasks. Built upon the Chemprop-RDKit backbone, QW-MTL adopts
quantum chemical descriptors to enrich molecular representations with
additional information about the electronic structure and interactions.
Meanwhile, it introduces a novel exponential task weighting scheme that
combines dataset-scale priors with learnable parameters to achieve dynamic loss
balancing across tasks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to
systematically conduct joint multi-task training across all 13 Therapeutics
Data Commons (TDC) classification benchmarks, using leaderboard-style data
splits to ensure a standardized and realistic evaluation setting. Extensive
experimental results show that QW-MTL significantly outperforms single-task
baselines on 12 out of 13 tasks, achieving high predictive performance with
minimal model complexity and fast inference, demonstrating the effectiveness
and efficiency of multi-task molecular learning enhanced by quantum-informed
features and adaptive task weighting.

Motivation: 表示相似性度量是神经科学和AI中的基础工具，但缺乏对不同模型家族间度量方法区分能力的系统比较。

Method: 使用信号检测理论的dprime、轮廓系数和ROC-AUC三种互补的分离性度量，系统评估常用相似性度量方法在不同架构（CNN、ViT、Swin、ConvNeXt）和训练机制（监督vs自监督）下的区分能力。

Result: 分离性随着度量方法施加更严格的对齐约束而系统性增加。在基于映射的方法中，软匹配获得最高分离性，其次是Procrustes对齐和线性预测性。非拟合方法如RSA也能在不同家族间产生强分离性。

Conclusion: 研究首次通过分离性视角系统比较了相似性度量方法，阐明了它们的相对敏感性，为大规模模型和大脑比较中的度量选择提供了指导。

Abstract: Representational similarity metrics are fundamental tools in neuroscience and
AI, yet we lack systematic comparisons of their discriminative power across
model families. We introduce a quantitative framework to evaluate
representational similarity measures based on their ability to separate model
families-across architectures (CNNs, Vision Transformers, Swin Transformers,
ConvNeXt) and training regimes (supervised vs. self-supervised). Using three
complementary separability measures-dprime from signal detection theory,
silhouette coefficients and ROC-AUC, we systematically assess the
discriminative capacity of commonly used metrics including RSA, linear
predictivity, Procrustes, and soft matching. We show that separability
systematically increases as metrics impose more stringent alignment
constraints. Among mapping-based approaches, soft-matching achieves the highest
separability, followed by Procrustes alignment and linear predictivity.
Non-fitting methods such as RSA also yield strong separability across families.
These results provide the first systematic comparison of similarity metrics
through a separability lens, clarifying their relative sensitivity and guiding
metric choice for large-scale model and brain comparisons.

Conclusion: 该方法成功将共形预测扩展到函数空间，为神经算子提供了有效的有限样本不确定性量化框架，在分辨率变化和超分辨率任务中表现出优越性能。

Abstract: Uncertainty quantification for neural operators remains an open problem in
the infinite-dimensional setting due to the lack of finite-sample coverage
guarantees over functional outputs. While conformal prediction offers
finite-sample guarantees in finite-dimensional spaces, it does not directly
extend to function-valued outputs. Existing approaches (Gaussian processes,
Bayesian neural networks, and quantile-based operators) require strong
distributional assumptions or yield conservative coverage. This work extends
split conformal prediction to function spaces following a two step method. We
first establish finite-sample coverage guarantees in a finite-dimensional space
using a discretization map in the output function space. Then these guarantees
are lifted to the function-space by considering the asymptotic convergence as
the discretization is refined. To characterize the effect of resolution, we
decompose the conformal radius into discretization, calibration, and
misspecification components. This decomposition motivates a regression-based
correction to transfer calibration across resolutions. Additionally, we propose
two diagnostic metrics (conformal ensemble score and internal agreement) to
quantify forecast degradation in autoregressive settings. Empirical results
show that our method maintains calibrated coverage with less variation under
resolution shifts and achieves better coverage in super-resolution tasks.

Method: 推导严格的有限样本界限，分析预测集大小与置信水平的关系，引入分散度作为二阶项，并在理想化设置中证明界限的可达性。

Result: 发现任何非平凡置信水平都会导致预测集大小呈指数增长，增长指数与样本数量和条件熵线性相关，分散度作为方差项影响界限。

Conclusion: 转导共形预测存在置信度与效率的根本权衡，预测集大小随置信要求呈指数增长，这一理论界限在实际设置中可以达到。

Abstract: Transductive conformal prediction addresses the simultaneous prediction for
multiple data points. Given a desired confidence level, the objective is to
construct a prediction set that includes the true outcomes with the prescribed
confidence. We demonstrate a fundamental trade-off between confidence and
efficiency in transductive methods, where efficiency is measured by the size of
the prediction sets. Specifically, we derive a strict finite-sample bound
showing that any non-trivial confidence level leads to exponential growth in
prediction set size for data with inherent uncertainty. The exponent scales
linearly with the number of samples and is proportional to the conditional
entropy of the data. Additionally, the bound includes a second-order term,
dispersion, defined as the variance of the log conditional probability
distribution. We show that this bound is achievable in an idealized setting.
Finally, we examine a special case of transductive prediction where all test
data points share the same label. We show that this scenario reduces to the
hypothesis testing problem with empirically observed statistics and provide an
asymptotically optimal confidence predictor, along with an analysis of the
error exponent.

Conclusion: 该灵活框架能够从生物学习行为数据中推断学习规则，为实验训练协议和行为数字双胞开发提供见解

Abstract: Understanding how animals learn is a central challenge in neuroscience, with
growing relevance to the development of animal- or human-aligned artificial
intelligence. However, most existing approaches assume specific parametric
forms for the learning rule (e.g., Q-learning, policy gradient) or are limited
to simplified settings like bandit tasks, which do not involve learning a new
input-output mapping from scratch. In contrast, animals must often learn new
behaviors de novo, which poses a rich challenge for learning-rule inference. We
target this problem by inferring learning rules directly from animal
decision-making data during de novo task learning, a setting that requires
models flexible enough to capture suboptimality, history dependence, and rich
external stimulus integration without strong structural priors. We first
propose a nonparametric framework that parameterizes the per-trial update of
policy weights with a deep neural network (DNN), and validate it by recovering
ground-truth rules in simulation. We then extend to a recurrent variant (RNN)
that captures non-Markovian dynamics by allowing updates to depend on trial
history. Applied to a large behavioral dataset of mice learning a sensory
decision-making task over multiple weeks, our models improved predictions on
held-out data. The inferred rules revealed asymmetric updates after correct
versus error trials and history dependence, consistent with non-Markovian
learning. Overall, these results introduce a flexible framework for inferring
biological learning rules from behavioral data in de novo learning tasks,
providing insights to inform experimental training protocols and the
development of behavioral digital twins.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 这篇论文研究了在差分隐私模型下的随机凸优化问题(DP-SCO)，采用Tsybakov噪声条件(TNC)和梯度的高阶矩条件。提出了不依赖Lipschitz常数的隐私算法，并给出了上界和下界分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 作者们观察到以往的DP-SCO研究假设损失函数满足Lipschitz连续性，但在实际应用中梯度可能有极大或无界的Lipschitz常数。通过采用TNC条件和梯度的高阶矩条件，可以更实际地处理这类问题。

Method: 采用Tsybakov噪声条件(θ>1)和梯度的k阶矩条件(k≥2)。对于θ≥2的Lipschitz情况，提出了(ε,δ)-DP算法；对于θ≥θ̅>1的情况进行了扩展；小隐私预算时甚至可以处理非Lipschitz损失函数。

Result: 获得了不依赖Lipschitz常数的上界结果：Õ((r̃_{2k}(1/√n + √d/nε))^{(k-1)/k})^{θ/(θ-1)})。小隐私预算时上界可改为Õ((r̃_k(1/√n + √d/nε))^{(k-1)/k})^{θ/(θ-1)})。下界结果为Ω((r̃_k(1/√n + √d/n√ρ))^{(k-1)/k})^{θ/(θ-1)})。

Conclusion: 这个工作扩展了DP-SCO的理论框架，能够处理梯度Lipschitz常数极大或无界的情况。通过TNC条件和梯度高阶矩条件，获得了与标准SCO相似的约束条件，为更广泛的实际应用提供了理论基础。

Abstract: We study Stochastic Convex Optimization in the Differential Privacy model
(DP-SCO). Unlike previous studies, here we assume the population risk function
satisfies the Tsybakov Noise Condition (TNC) with some parameter $\theta>1$,
where the Lipschitz constant of the loss could be extremely large or even
unbounded, but the $\ell_2$-norm gradient of the loss has bounded $k$-th moment
with $k\geq 2$. For the Lipschitz case with $\theta\geq 2$, we first propose an
$(\varepsilon, \delta)$-DP algorithm whose utility bound is
$\Tilde{O}\left(\left(\tilde{r}_{2k}(\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}+(\frac{\sqrt{d}}{n\varepsilon}))^\frac{k-1}{k}\right)^\frac{\theta}{\theta-1}\right)$
in high probability, where $n$ is the sample size, $d$ is the model dimension,
and $\tilde{r}_{2k}$ is a term that only depends on the $2k$-th moment of the
gradient. It is notable that such an upper bound is independent of the
Lipschitz constant. We then extend to the case where
  $\theta\geq \bar{\theta}> 1$ for some known constant $\bar{\theta}$.
Moreover, when the privacy budget $\varepsilon$ is small enough, we show an
upper bound of
$\tilde{O}\left(\left(\tilde{r}_{k}(\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}+(\frac{\sqrt{d}}{n\varepsilon}))^\frac{k-1}{k}\right)^\frac{\theta}{\theta-1}\right)$
even if the loss function is not Lipschitz. For the lower bound, we show that
for any $\theta\geq 2$, the private minimax rate for $\rho$-zero Concentrated
Differential Privacy is lower bounded by
$\Omega\left(\left(\tilde{r}_{k}(\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}+(\frac{\sqrt{d}}{n\sqrt{\rho}}))^\frac{k-1}{k}\right)^\frac{\theta}{\theta-1}\right)$.

Method: 使用卷积长短期记忆（CNN LSTM）模型，在由简单多项式函数加噪声生成的合成时间序列上进行训练，然后将模型推广到各种随机系统和实际数据集。

Result: 模型能够准确识别闪烁模式，即使在简化的动力学系统上训练，也能很好地泛化到不同的随机系统，并在实证数据（如睡鼠体温记录和非洲湿润期古气候代理数据）中可靠地检测到闪烁现象。

Conclusion: 深度学习能够从噪声非线性时间序列中提取早期预警信号，为识别各种动力系统中的不稳定性提供了一个灵活的框架。

Abstract: Deep learning offers powerful tools for anticipating tipping points in
complex systems, yet its potential for detecting flickering (noise-driven
switching between coexisting stable states) remains unexplored. Flickering is a
hallmark of reduced resilience in climate systems, ecosystems, financial
markets, and other systems. It can precede critical regime shifts that are
highly impactful but difficult to predict. Here we show that convolutional long
short-term memory (CNN LSTM) models, trained on synthetic time series generated
from simple polynomial functions with additive noise, can accurately identify
flickering patterns. Despite being trained on simplified dynamics, our models
generalize to diverse stochastic systems and reliably detect flickering in
empirical datasets, including dormouse body temperature records and
palaeoclimate proxies from the African Humid Period. These findings demonstrate
that deep learning can extract early warning signals from noisy, nonlinear time
series, providing a flexible framework for identifying instability across a
wide range of dynamical systems.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 提出了一个名为KRAFT的学习型地图融合方法，通过知识图谱构建、地图匹配和地图合并三个模块，解决了现有方法只能处理线性对象和基于启发式规则的局限性，在性能上显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 数字地图在导航、车队管理等应用中至关重要，但现有地理空间数据库存在区域覆盖不全和实体缺失问题。传统地图融合方法只能处理线性对象且基于预定义规则，无法以数据驱动方式学习实体匹配。

Method: KRAFT包含三个部分：1) 知识图谱构建 - 将每个地理空间数据库表示为知识图谱；2) 地图匹配 - 使用知识图谱对齐方法和地理空间特征编码器匹配实体；3) 地图合并 - 使用混合整数线性规划公式一致地合并匹配实体。

Result: 实验评估显示，KRAFT在地图融合任务中不仅相比最先进方法和基线方法表现出色，其各个模块（如地图匹配和地图合并）也分别优于传统的匹配和合并方法。

Conclusion: KRAFT成功解决了现有地图融合方法的局限性，通过数据驱动的学习方式实现了对非线性对象的有效融合，为地图数据的完整性和准确性提供了有效的解决方案。

Abstract: Digital maps play a crucial role in various applications such as navigation,
fleet management, and ride-sharing, necessitating their accuracy and currency,
which require timely updates. While the majority of geospatial databases (GDBs)
provide high-quality information, their data is (i) limited to specific regions
and/or (ii) missing some entities, even in their covered areas. Map conflation
is the process of augmentation of a GDB using another GDB to conflate missing
spatial features. Existing map conflation methods suffer from two main
limitations: (1) They are designed for the conflation of linear objects (e.g.,
road networks) and cannot simply be extended to non-linear objects, thus
missing information about most entities in the map. (2) They are heuristic
algorithmic approaches that are based on pre-defined rules, unable to learn
entities matching in a data-driven manner. To address these limitations, we
design KRAFT, a learning based approach consisting of three parts: (1)
Knowledge Graph Construction - where each GDB is represented by a knowledge
graph, (2) Map Matching - where we use a knowledge graph alignment method as
well as a geospatial feature encoder to match entities in obtained knowledge
graphs, and (3) Map Merging - where we merge matched entities in the previous
modules in a consistent manner, using a mixed integer linear programming
formulation that fully merges the GDBs without adding any inconsistencies. Our
experimental evaluation shows that not only does KRAFT achieve outstanding
performance compared to state-of-the-art and baseline methods in map conflation
tasks, but each of its modules (e.g., Map Matching and Map Merging) also
separately outperforms traditional matching and merging methods.

TL;DR: 通过对比预训练框架将表面电因图（sEMG）与手部姿态对齐，提升了手势分类的表征质量和零样本分类能力


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 利用低功耗、成本效的生物信号（如sEMG）在可穿戴设备上实现持续手势预测，对齐弱模态数据与高质量结构化数据的表征来提升表征质量

Method: 提出对比姿态-EMG预训练（CPEP）框架，学习一个能够产生高质量且含有姿态信息的EMG编码器，实现EMG和姿态表征的对齐

Result: 模型在分布内手势分类上超过emg2pose基准模型达21%，在未见手势（分布外）分类上超迈72%

Conclusion: 通过将弱模态EMG数据与高质量姿态数据对齐，可以显著提升表征质量并实现零样本分类，为可穿戴设备的持续手势预测提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: Hand gesture classification using high-quality structured data such as
videos, images, and hand skeletons is a well-explored problem in computer
vision. Leveraging low-power, cost-effective biosignals, e.g. surface
electromyography (sEMG), allows for continuous gesture prediction on wearables.
In this paper, we demonstrate that learning representations from weak-modality
data that are aligned with those from structured, high-quality data can improve
representation quality and enables zero-shot classification. Specifically, we
propose a Contrastive Pose-EMG Pre-training (CPEP) framework to align EMG and
pose representations, where we learn an EMG encoder that produces high-quality
and pose-informative representations. We assess the gesture classification
performance of our model through linear probing and zero-shot setups. Our model
outperforms emg2pose benchmark models by up to 21% on in-distribution gesture
classification and 72% on unseen (out-of-distribution) gesture classification.

TL;DR: Error


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: Error

Method: Error

Result: Error

Conclusion: Error

Abstract: Spectral behaviors have been widely discussed in machine learning, yet the
optimizer's own spectral bias remains unclear. We argue that first-order
optimizers exhibit an intrinsic frequency preference that significantly
reshapes the optimization path. To address this, we propose Natural Spectral
Fusion (NSF): reframing training as controllable spectral coverage and
information fusion rather than merely scaling step sizes. NSF has two core
principles: treating the optimizer as a spectral controller that dynamically
balances low- and high-frequency information; and periodically reweighting
frequency bands at negligible cost, without modifying the model, data, or
training pipeline. We realize NSF via a p-exponent extension of the
second-moment term, enabling both positive and negative exponents, and
implement it through cyclic scheduling. Theory and experiments show that
adaptive methods emphasize low frequencies, SGD is near-neutral, and negative
exponents amplify high-frequency information. Cyclic scheduling broadens
spectral coverage, improves cross-band fusion, and induces early
decision-boundary alignment, where accuracy improves even while loss remains
high. Across multiple benchmarks, with identical learning-rate strategies and
fixed hyperparameters, p-exponent cyclic scheduling consistently reduces test
error and demonstrates distinct convergence behavior; on some tasks, it matches
baseline accuracy with only one-quarter of the training cost. Overall, NSF
reveals the optimizer's role as an active spectral controller and provides a
unified, controllable, and efficient framework for first-order optimization.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: CoVeR是一种基于共形预测框架的无模型解码策略，能够在保持紧凑搜索空间的同时确保对期望轨迹的高覆盖概率，解决了传统解码方法缺乏可证明覆盖保证的问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 主流解码策略如beam search虽然能生成合理的候选集，但缺乏可证明的覆盖保证，且在搜索效率和多样化轨迹需求（特别是长尾序列）之间难以有效平衡。

Method: 提出CoVeR方法，基于共形预测框架构建模型无关的解码策略，通过理论分析建立PAC风格的泛化边界。

Result: 理论证明CoVeR能够渐近地实现至少1-α的覆盖率，其中α∈(0,1)是任意目标水平。

Conclusion: CoVeR为复杂推理任务提供了一种具有可证明覆盖保证的高效解码方案，特别适用于需要长尾序列的真实应用场景。

Abstract: Autoregressive pre-trained models combined with decoding methods have
achieved impressive performance on complex reasoning tasks. While mainstream
decoding strategies such as beam search can generate plausible candidate sets,
they often lack provable coverage guarantees, and struggle to effectively
balance search efficiency with the need for versatile trajectories,
particularly those involving long-tail sequences that are essential in certain
real-world applications. To address these limitations, we propose
\textsc{CoVeR}, a novel model-free decoding strategy wihtin the conformal
prediction framework that simultaneously maintains a compact search space and
ensures high coverage probability over desirable trajectories. Theoretically,
we establish a PAC-style generalization bound, guaranteeing that \textsc{CoVeR}
asymptotically achieves a coverage rate of at least $1 - \alpha$ for any target
level $\alpha \in (0,1)$.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: Beyond I-Con框架通过探索替代统计散度和相似性核，系统性地发现新的损失函数，在无监督聚类、监督对比学习和降维任务中均取得优于现有方法的结果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: I-Con框架发现现有表示学习方法隐含地最小化数据分布与学习分布之间的KL散度，但KL散度的不对称性和无界性可能导致优化问题，且可能与真实目标不一致。

Method: 提出Beyond I-Con框架，系统探索不同的统计散度（如总变差距离、有界f-散度）和相似性核（如距离核替代角度核），构建新的损失函数。

Result: 在无监督聚类DINO-ViT嵌入上达到SOTA；在监督对比学习中超越标准方法；在降维任务中获得更好的定性结果和下游任务性能。

Conclusion: 统计散度和相似性核的选择对表示学习优化至关重要，Beyond I-Con框架为系统探索这些选择提供了有效途径。

Abstract: The Information Contrastive (I-Con) framework revealed that over 23
representation learning methods implicitly minimize KL divergence between data
and learned distributions that encode similarities between data points.
However, a KL-based loss may be misaligned with the true objective, and
properties of KL divergence such as asymmetry and unboundedness may create
optimization challenges. We present Beyond I-Con, a framework that enables
systematic discovery of novel loss functions by exploring alternative
statistical divergences and similarity kernels. Key findings: (1) on
unsupervised clustering of DINO-ViT embeddings, we achieve state-of-the-art
results by modifying the PMI algorithm to use total variation (TV) distance;
(2) on supervised contrastive learning, we outperform the standard approach by
using TV and a distance-based similarity kernel instead of KL and an angular
kernel; (3) on dimensionality reduction, we achieve superior qualitative
results and better performance on downstream tasks than SNE by replacing KL
with a bounded f-divergence. Our results highlight the importance of
considering divergence and similarity kernel choices in representation learning
optimization.

TL;DR: VARMAformer结合了现代Transformer架构和经典时间序列分析原理，通过VARMA特征提取器和增强注意力机制，在保持高效性的同时更好地捕捉局部时间依赖关系，在多个基准数据集上优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有的简化Transformer架构（如CATS）虽然提高了效率和准确性，但可能忽略了经典统计模型（如VARMA）能够有效捕捉的细粒度局部时间依赖性。

Method: 提出VARMAformer架构，包含两个关键创新：1）VARMA启发的特征提取器（VFE），在patch级别显式建模自回归和移动平均模式；2）VARMA增强注意力机制（VE-atten），使用时序门控使查询更具上下文感知能力。

Result: 在广泛使用的基准数据集上进行大量实验，证明该模型始终优于现有的最先进方法。

Conclusion: 这项工作验证了将经典统计洞察融入现代深度学习框架对时间序列预测的显著益处，能够同时捕捉全局长期依赖和局部统计结构。

Abstract: Transformer-based models have significantly advanced time series forecasting.
Recent work, like the Cross-Attention-only Time Series transformer (CATS),
shows that removing self-attention can make the model more accurate and
efficient. However, these streamlined architectures may overlook the
fine-grained, local temporal dependencies effectively captured by classical
statistical models like Vector AutoRegressive Moving Average model (VARMA). To
address this gap, we propose VARMAformer, a novel architecture that synergizes
the efficiency of a cross-attention-only framework with the principles of
classical time series analysis. Our model introduces two key innovations: (1) a
dedicated VARMA-inspired Feature Extractor (VFE) that explicitly models
autoregressive (AR) and moving-average (MA) patterns at the patch level, and
(2) a VARMA-Enhanced Attention (VE-atten) mechanism that employs a temporal
gate to make queries more context-aware. By fusing these classical insights
into a modern backbone, VARMAformer captures both global, long-range
dependencies and local, statistical structures. Through extensive experiments
on widely-used benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that our model consistently
outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods. Our work validates the
significant benefit of integrating classical statistical insights into modern
deep learning frameworks for time series forecasting.

Abstract: With increasing concerns about privacy attacks and potential sensitive
information leakage, researchers have actively explored methods to efficiently
remove sensitive training data and reduce privacy risks in graph neural network
(GNN) models. Node unlearning has emerged as a promising technique for
protecting the privacy of sensitive nodes by efficiently removing specific
training node information from GNN models. However, existing node unlearning
methods either impose restrictions on the GNN structure or do not effectively
utilize the graph topology for node unlearning. Some methods even compromise
the graph's topology, making it challenging to achieve a satisfactory
performance-complexity trade-off. To address these issues and achieve efficient
unlearning for training node removal in GNNs, we propose three novel node
unlearning methods: Class-based Label Replacement, Topology-guided Neighbor
Mean Posterior Probability, and Class-consistent Neighbor Node Filtering. Among
these methods, Topology-guided Neighbor Mean Posterior Probability and
Class-consistent Neighbor Node Filtering effectively leverage the topological
features of the graph, resulting in more effective node unlearning. To validate
the superiority of our proposed methods in node unlearning, we conducted
experiments on three benchmark datasets. The evaluation criteria included model
utility, unlearning utility, and unlearning efficiency. The experimental
results demonstrate the utility and efficiency of the proposed methods and
illustrate their superiority compared to state-of-the-art node unlearning
methods. Overall, the proposed methods efficiently remove sensitive training
nodes and protect the privacy information of sensitive nodes in GNNs. The
findings contribute to enhancing the privacy and security of GNN models and
provide valuable insights into the field of node unlearning.

Conclusion: 提出的ACED-DQN框架使强化学习智能体能够持续学习，灵感来源于人脑机制，为解决灾难性遗忘问题提供了有效方案

Abstract: Deep reinforcement learning (RL) models, despite their efficiency in learning
an optimal policy in static environments, easily loses previously learned
knowledge (i.e., catastrophic forgetting). It leads RL models to poor
performance in continual reinforcement learning (CRL) scenarios. To address
this, we present an arbitration control mechanism over an ensemble of RL
agents. It is motivated by and closely aligned with how humans make decisions
in a CRL context using an arbitration control of multiple RL agents in parallel
as observed in the prefrontal cortex. We integrated two key ideas into our
model: (1) an ensemble of RLs (i.e., DQN variants) explicitly trained to have
diverse value functions and (2) an arbitration control that prioritizes agents
with higher reliability (i.e., less error) in recent trials. We propose a
framework for CRL, an Arbitration Control for an Ensemble of Diversified DQN
variants (ACED-DQN). We demonstrate significant performance improvements in
both static and continual environments, supported by empirical evidence showing
the effectiveness of arbitration control over diversified DQNs during training.
In this work, we introduced a framework that enables RL agents to continuously
learn, with inspiration from the human brain.

Abstract: Time series forecasting plays a critical role in decision-making processes
across diverse fields including meteorology, traffic, electricity, economics,
finance, and so on. Especially, predicting returns on financial instruments is
a challenging problem. Some researchers have proposed time series foundation
models applicable to various forecasting tasks. Simultaneously, based on the
recognition that real-world time series exhibit chaotic properties, methods
have been developed to artificially generate synthetic chaotic time series,
construct diverse datasets and train models. In this study, we propose a
methodology for modeling financial time series by generating artificial chaotic
time series and applying resampling techniques to simulate financial time
series data, which we then use as training samples. Increasing the resampling
interval to extend predictive horizons, we conducted large-scale pre-training
using 10 billion training samples for each case. We subsequently created test
datasets for multiple timeframes using actual Bitcoin trade data and performed
zero-shot prediction without re-training the pre-trained model. The results of
evaluating the profitability of a simple trading strategy based on these
predictions demonstrated significant performance improvements over
autocorrelation models. During the large-scale pre-training process, we
observed a scaling law-like phenomenon that we can achieve predictive
performance at a certain level with extended predictive horizons for chaotic
time series by increasing the number of training samples exponentially. If this
scaling law proves robust and holds true across various chaotic models, it
suggests the potential to predict near-future events by investing substantial
computational resources. Future research should focus on further large-scale
training and verifying the applicability of this scaling law to diverse chaotic
models.

Abstract: The limited ability to reason across occupational data from different sources
is a long-standing bottleneck for data-driven labour market analytics. Previous
research has relied on hand-crafted ontologies that allow such reasoning but
are computationally expensive and require careful maintenance by human experts.
The rise of language processing machine learning models offers a scalable
alternative by learning shared semantic spaces that bridge diverse occupational
vocabularies without extensive human curation. We present an embedding-based
alignment process that links any free-form German job title to two established
ontologies - the German Klassifikation der Berufe and the International
Standard Classification of Education. Using publicly available data from the
German Federal Employment Agency, we construct a dataset to fine-tune a
Sentence-BERT model to learn the structure imposed by the ontologies. The
enriched pairs (job title, embedding) define a similarity graph structure that
we can use for efficient approximate nearest-neighbour search, allowing us to
frame the classification process as a semantic search problem. This allows for
greater flexibility, e.g., adding more classes. We discuss design decisions,
open challenges, and outline ongoing work on extending the graph with other
ontologies and multilingual titles.

Abstract: Blinks in electroencephalography (EEG) are often treated as unwanted
artifacts. However, recent studies have demonstrated that blink rate and its
variability are important physiological markers to monitor cognitive load,
attention, and potential neurological disorders. This paper addresses the
critical task of accurate blink detection by evaluating various deep learning
models for segmenting EEG signals into involuntary blinks and non-blinks. We
present a pipeline for blink detection using 1, 3, or 5 frontal EEG electrodes.
The problem is formulated as a sequence-to-sequence task and tested on various
deep learning architectures including standard recurrent neural networks,
convolutional neural networks (both standard and depth-wise), temporal
convolutional networks (TCN), transformer-based models, and hybrid
architectures. The models were trained on raw EEG signals with minimal
pre-processing. Training and testing was carried out on a public dataset of 31
subjects collected at UCSD. This dataset consisted of 15 healthy participants
and 16 patients with Parkinson's disease allowing us to verify the model's
robustness to tremor. Out of all models, CNN-RNN hybrid model consistently

TL;DR: 提出使用双随机归一化方法分离混淆矩阵中的类别相似性和分布偏差因素，从而更准确地诊断模型行为


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 混淆矩阵值同时受类别相似性和分布偏差影响，难以区分两者的独立贡献，需要一种方法来分离这些因素

Method: 使用迭代比例拟合的双随机归一化方法，这是行和列归一化的泛化，能够恢复类别相似性的底层结构

Result: 该方法能够分离误差来源，支持更有针对性的模型改进，并在模型的内部类别表示空间中提供几何解释

Conclusion: 双随机归一化提供了一种有效的方法来理解混淆矩阵背后的因素，为分类器行为提供更深入的洞察

Abstract: The confusion matrix is a standard tool for evaluating classifiers by
providing insights into class-level errors. In heterogeneous settings, its
values are shaped by two main factors: class similarity -- how easily the model
confuses two classes -- and distribution bias, arising from skewed
distributions in the training and test sets. However, confusion matrix values
reflect a mix of both factors, making it difficult to disentangle their
individual contributions. To address this, we introduce bistochastic
normalization using Iterative Proportional Fitting, a generalization of row and
column normalization. Unlike standard normalizations, this method recovers the
underlying structure of class similarity. By disentangling error sources, it
enables more accurate diagnosis of model behavior and supports more targeted
improvements. We also show a correspondence between confusion matrix
normalizations and the model's internal class representations. Both standard
and bistochastic normalizations can be interpreted geometrically in this space,
offering a deeper understanding of what normalization reveals about a
classifier.

TL;DR: NeuSA是一种基于谱方法的物理信息神经网络，通过谱基投影和神经ODE集成来解决PINNs在复杂初值问题中的收敛困难、因果性违反和谱偏差问题。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 标准MLP-based PINNs在处理复杂初值问题时经常无法收敛，导致解违反因果性并偏向低频分量，需要新的架构来解决这些问题。

Method: NeuSA学习PDE在谱基上的投影，获得动力学的有限维表示，然后与适应的神经ODE集成，利用谱表示的高频分量和神经ODE的因果结构。

Result: 在线性和非线性波动方程的基准测试中，NeuSA相比其他架构表现出更强的性能，具有更快的收敛速度、改进的时间一致性和更高的预测精度。

Conclusion: NeuSA通过结合谱方法和神经ODE，成功克服了PINNs的谱偏差和因果性问题，为复杂PDE求解提供了有效的神经网络框架。

Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have emerged as a powerful neural
framework for solving partial differential equations (PDEs). However, standard
MLP-based PINNs often fail to converge when dealing with complex initial-value
problems, leading to solutions that violate causality and suffer from a
spectral bias towards low-frequency components. To address these issues, we
introduce NeuSA (Neuro-Spectral Architectures), a novel class of PINNs inspired
by classical spectral methods, designed to solve linear and nonlinear PDEs with
variable coefficients. NeuSA learns a projection of the underlying PDE onto a
spectral basis, leading to a finite-dimensional representation of the dynamics
which is then integrated with an adapted Neural ODE (NODE). This allows us to
overcome spectral bias, by leveraging the high-frequency components enabled by
the spectral representation; to enforce causality, by inheriting the causal
structure of NODEs, and to start training near the target solution, by means of
an initialization scheme based on classical methods. We validate NeuSA on
canonical benchmarks for linear and nonlinear wave equations, demonstrating
strong performance as compared to other architectures, with faster convergence,
improved temporal consistency and superior predictive accuracy. Code and
pretrained models will be released.

Motivation: 解决云服务器环境中路由策略优化问题，特别是在动态拓扑下决策不稳定和结构感知不足的挑战。

Method: 构建统一框架，包含SASE模块（多层图卷积和结构位置嵌入建模节点状态）和PAGU模块（基于策略行为变化和奖励反馈调整图结构）。

Result: 在GEANT拓扑数据集上实验表明，该方法在吞吐量、延迟控制和链路平衡等多个性能指标上优于现有图强化学习模型。

Conclusion: 该方法能够实现动态复杂云网络中高效且鲁棒的路由，通过结构建模和自适应图更新提升了模型稳定性和决策质量。

Abstract: This paper proposes a topology-aware graph reinforcement learning approach to
address the routing policy optimization problem in cloud server environments.
The method builds a unified framework for state representation and structural
evolution by integrating a Structure-Aware State Encoding (SASE) module and a
Policy-Adaptive Graph Update (PAGU) mechanism. It aims to tackle the challenges
of decision instability and insufficient structural awareness under dynamic
topologies. The SASE module models node states through multi-layer graph
convolution and structural positional embeddings, capturing high-order
dependencies in the communication topology and enhancing the expressiveness of
state representations. The PAGU module adjusts the graph structure based on
policy behavior shifts and reward feedback, enabling adaptive structural
updates in dynamic environments. Experiments are conducted on the real-world
GEANT topology dataset, where the model is systematically evaluated against
several representative baselines in terms of throughput, latency control, and
link balance. Additional experiments, including hyperparameter sensitivity,
graph sparsity perturbation, and node feature dimensionality variation, further
explore the impact of structure modeling and graph updates on model stability
and decision quality. Results show that the proposed method outperforms
existing graph reinforcement learning models across multiple performance
metrics, achieving efficient and robust routing in dynamic and complex cloud
networks.

TL;DR: 本文提出SAR和SAR²方法解决测试时自适应(TTA)在混合分布偏移、小批量数据和在线不平衡标签分布等现实场景中的不稳定性问题，通过梯度感知样本筛选和平坦最小值优化来稳定TTA性能。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有TTA方法在真实部署中面临三个主要挑战：混合分布偏移、小批量数据和在线不平衡标签分布，导致模型性能下降甚至崩溃。研究发现批归一化层是影响TTA稳定性的关键因素，而使用组归一化或层归一化后仍存在模型崩溃问题。

Method: 1. 提出SAR方法：基于锐度感知和可靠熵最小化，通过移除大梯度噪声样本和鼓励模型权重达到平坦最小值来稳定TTA；2. 提出SAR²方法：在SAR基础上增加冗余正则器和不公平正则器，分别减少特征维度间相关性和最大化原型质心的预测熵，防止表示崩溃。

Result: 实验结果表明，所提方法在多种wild测试场景下比现有方法表现更稳定，且计算效率高。

Conclusion: SAR和SAR²方法有效解决了TTA在现实部署中的稳定性问题，通过梯度感知样本筛选、平坦最小值优化和表示正则化，显著提升了模型在挑战性测试环境中的适应能力和鲁棒性。

Abstract: Test-time adaptation (TTA) may fail to improve or even harm the model
performance when test data have: 1) mixed distribution shifts, 2) small batch
sizes, 3) online imbalanced label distribution shifts. This is often a key
obstacle preventing existing TTA methods from being deployed in the real world.
In this paper, we investigate the unstable reasons and find that the batch norm
layer is a crucial factor hindering TTA stability. Conversely, TTA can perform
more stably with batch-agnostic norm layers, i.e., group or layer norm.
However, we observe that TTA with group and layer norms does not always succeed
and still suffers many failure cases, i.e., the model collapses into trivial
solutions by assigning the same class label for all samples. By digging into
this, we find that, during the collapse process: 1) the model gradients often
undergo an initial explosion followed by rapid degradation, suggesting that
certain noisy test samples with large gradients may disrupt adaptation; and 2)
the model representations tend to exhibit high correlations and classification
bias. To address this, we first propose a sharpness-aware and reliable entropy
minimization method, called SAR, for stabilizing TTA from two aspects: 1)
remove partial noisy samples with large gradients, 2) encourage model weights
to go to a flat minimum so that the model is robust to the remaining noisy
samples. Based on SAR, we further introduce SAR^2 to prevent representation
collapse with two regularizers: 1) a redundancy regularizer to reduce
inter-dimensional correlations among centroid-invariant features; and 2) an
inequity regularizer to maximize the prediction entropy of a prototype
centroid, thereby penalizing biased representations toward any specific class.
Promising results demonstrate that our methods perform more stably over prior
methods and are computationally efficient under the above wild test scenarios.

Abstract: Directed evolution is an iterative laboratory process of designing proteins
with improved function by iteratively synthesizing new protein variants and
evaluating their desired property with expensive and time-consuming biochemical
screening. Machine learning methods can help select informative or promising
variants for screening to increase their quality and reduce the amount of
necessary screening. In this paper, we present a novel method for
machine-learning-assisted directed evolution of proteins which combines
Bayesian optimization with informative representation of protein variants
extracted from a pre-trained protein language model. We demonstrate that the
new representation based on the sequence embeddings significantly improves the
performance of Bayesian optimization yielding better results with the same
number of conducted screening in total. At the same time, our method
outperforms the state-of-the-art machine-learning-assisted directed evolution
methods with regression objective.

Motivation: 现有的初始化方法如Glorot、He、正交矩阵等都有其局限性，对于深度网络，保持单位方差的理论假设并不能达到最佳效果，需要从第一层到最后一层逐渐增加方差。

Method: 提出了一种新的初始化方法，结合了每个层的深度信息和总网络深度，以灵活的方式增加网络的方差。该方法超越了传统的单位方差假设。

Result: 实验结果显示，提出的方法在深度网络中表现出艾，性能超过了现有的初始化方案。

Conclusion: 通过考虑每个层的深度信息并灵活控制方差的逐层增长，可以实现更好的深度神经网络初始化效果，这种方法在实验中验证了其优势。

Abstract: In past few years, various initialization schemes have been proposed. These
schemes are glorot initialization, He initialization, initialization using
orthogonal matrix, random walk method for initialization. Some of these methods
stress on keeping unit variance of activation and gradient propagation through
the network layer. Few of these methods are independent of the depth
information while some methods has considered the total network depth for
better initialization. In this paper, comprehensive study has been done where
depth information of each layer as well as total network is incorporated for
better initialization scheme. It has also been studied that for deeper networks
theoretical assumption of unit variance throughout the network does not perform
well. It requires the need to increase the variance of the network from first
layer activation to last layer activation. We proposed a novel way to increase
the variance of the network in flexible manner, which incorporates the
information of each layer depth. Experiments shows that proposed method
performs better than the existing initialization scheme.

Abstract: Accurate prediction of time-to-event outcomes is a central challenge in
oncology, with significant implications for treatment planning and patient
management. In this work, we present MultiSurv, a multimodal deep survival
model utilising DeepHit with a projection layer and inter-modality
cross-attention, which integrates heterogeneous patient data, including
clinical, MRI, RNA-seq and whole-slide pathology features. The model is
designed to capture complementary prognostic signals across modalities and
estimate individualised time-to-biochemical recurrence in prostate cancer and
time-to-cancer recurrence in bladder cancer. Our approach was evaluated in the
context of the CHIMERA Grand Challenge, across two of the three provided tasks.
For Task 1 (prostate cancer bio-chemical recurrence prediction), the proposed
framework achieved a concordance index (C-index) of 0.843 on 5-folds
cross-validation and 0.818 on CHIMERA development set, demonstrating robust
discriminatory ability. For Task 3 (bladder cancer recurrence prediction), the
model obtained a C-index of 0.662 on 5-folds cross-validation and 0.457 on
development set, highlighting its adaptability and potential for clinical
translation. These results suggest that leveraging multimodal integration with
deep survival learning provides a promising pathway toward personalised risk
stratification in prostate and bladder cancer. Beyond the challenge setting,
our framework is broadly applicable to survival prediction tasks involving
heterogeneous biomedical data.

Abstract: The primary paradigm in Neural Combinatorial Optimization (NCO) are
construction methods, where a neural network is trained to sequentially add one
solution component at a time until a complete solution is constructed. We
observe that the typical changes to the state between two steps are small,
since usually only the node that gets added to the solution is removed from the
state. An efficient model should be able to reuse computation done in prior
steps. To that end, we propose to train a recurrent encoder that computes the
state embeddings not only based on the state but also the embeddings of the
step before. We show that the recurrent encoder can achieve equivalent or
better performance than a non-recurrent encoder even if it consists of
$3\times$ fewer layers, thus significantly improving on latency. We demonstrate
our findings on three different problems: the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP),
the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP), and the Orienteering Problem
(OP) and integrate the models into a large neighborhood search algorithm, to
showcase the practical relevance of our findings.

Motivation: 为了解决参数化偏微分方程(PDE)求解中需要针对每个具体任务进行微调的问题，开发一个能够零样本泛化到广泛PDE类别的神经算子方法。

Method: 结合Swin Transformer超网络和混合监督：使用MMS生成的解析解作为标签数据，以及物理信息目标优化的无标签样本。模型将PDE参数映射到目标PINNs，并引入迭代精炼过程生成集成解。

Result: 在7个PINN文献基准问题上实现强零样本精度，优于U-Nets、Poseidon和PINO。迭代精炼在6个基准上实现误差渐进减少，最佳情况下平均L2损失提升100倍以上。微调时收敛更快且最终误差更低。

Conclusion: HyPINO展示了作为扩展神经算子解决复杂非线性高维PDE问题的基础潜力，具有显著提高的精度和降低的计算成本。

Abstract: We present HyPINO, a multi-physics neural operator designed for zero-shot
generalization across a broad class of parametric PDEs without requiring
task-specific fine-tuning. Our approach combines a Swin Transformer-based
hypernetwork with mixed supervision: (i) labeled data from analytical solutions
generated via the Method of Manufactured Solutions (MMS), and (ii) unlabeled
samples optimized using physics-informed objectives. The model maps PDE
parametrizations to target Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) and can
handle linear elliptic, hyperbolic, and parabolic equations in two dimensions
with varying source terms, geometries, and mixed Dirichlet/Neumann boundary
conditions, including interior boundaries. HyPINO achieves strong zero-shot
accuracy on seven benchmark problems from PINN literature, outperforming
U-Nets, Poseidon, and Physics-Informed Neural Operators (PINO). Further, we
introduce an iterative refinement procedure that compares the physics of the
generated PINN to the requested PDE and uses the discrepancy to generate a
"delta" PINN. Summing their contributions and repeating this process forms an
ensemble whose combined solution progressively reduces the error on six
benchmarks and achieves over 100x gain in average $L_2$ loss in the best case,
while retaining forward-only inference. Additionally, we evaluate the
fine-tuning behavior of PINNs initialized by HyPINO and show that they converge
faster and to lower final error than both randomly initialized and
Reptile-meta-learned PINNs on five benchmarks, performing on par on the
remaining two. Our results highlight the potential of this scalable approach as
a foundation for extending neural operators toward solving increasingly
complex, nonlinear, and high-dimensional PDE problems with significantly
improved accuracy and reduced computational cost.

Motivation: 许多数据集中的类别标签具有层次结构，虽然分类任务通常在特定层级定义，但训练时可以使用更细粒度的标签。现有经验证据表明细粒度训练可以提升性能，但需要系统性研究其普适性和内在原因

Method: 使用真实和合成数据集，分析细粒度标签训练对分类准确性的影响，重点研究数据几何结构、标签层次关系、数据集大小和模型容量等因素的作用

Result: 细粒度标签训练并非普遍有效，其效果高度依赖于数据几何结构与标签层次的关系。当细粒度标签能更好地反映数据的内在结构时才能带来性能提升

Conclusion: 细粒度标签训练的效果是有条件的，需要根据具体的数据特征和任务要求来决定是否采用这种策略，不能盲目认为细粒度标签总是有益的

Abstract: In classification problems, models must predict a class label based on the
input data features. However, class labels are organized hierarchically in many
datasets. While a classification task is often defined at a specific level of
this hierarchy, training can utilize a finer granularity of labels. Empirical
evidence suggests that such fine-grained training can enhance performance. In
this work, we investigate the generality of this observation and explore its
underlying causes using both real and synthetic datasets. We show that training
on fine-grained labels does not universally improve classification accuracy.
Instead, the effectiveness of this strategy depends critically on the geometric
structure of the data and its relations with the label hierarchy. Additionally,
factors such as dataset size and model capacity significantly influence whether
fine-grained labels provide a performance benefit.

Conclusion: 自适应对手的存在对学习理论提出了更严峻的挑战，其可学习性条件比传统无意识对手的情况更加严格。

Abstract: We consider the question of learnability of distribution classes in the
presence of adaptive adversaries -- that is, adversaries capable of
intercepting the samples requested by a learner and applying manipulations with
full knowledge of the samples before passing it on to the learner. This stands
in contrast to oblivious adversaries, who can only modify the underlying
distribution the samples come from but not their i.i.d.\ nature. We formulate a
general notion of learnability with respect to adaptive adversaries, taking
into account the budget of the adversary. We show that learnability with
respect to additive adaptive adversaries is a strictly stronger condition than
learnability with respect to additive oblivious adversaries.

Abstract: Federated learning has the potential to unlock siloed data and distributed
resources by enabling collaborative model training without sharing private
data. As more complex foundational models gain widespread use, the need to
expand training resources and integrate privately owned data grows as well. In
this article, we explore the intersection of federated learning and
foundational models, aiming to identify, categorize, and characterize technical
methods that integrate the two paradigms. As a unified survey is currently
unavailable, we present a literature survey structured around a novel taxonomy
that follows the development life-cycle stages, along with a technical
comparison of available methods. Additionally, we provide practical insights
and guidelines for implementing and evolving these methods, with a specific
focus on the healthcare domain as a case study, where the potential impact of
federated learning and foundational models is considered significant. Our
survey covers multiple intersecting topics, including but not limited to
federated learning, self-supervised learning, fine-tuning, distillation, and
transfer learning. Initially, we retrieved and reviewed a set of over 4,200
articles. This collection was narrowed to more than 250 thoroughly reviewed
articles through inclusion criteria, featuring 42 unique methods. The methods
were used to construct the taxonomy and enabled their comparison based on
complexity, efficiency, and scalability. We present these results as a

also provides insights into the practical aspects of adopting, evolving, and
integrating foundational models with federated learning.

Conclusion: 该方法为长上下文LLM部署提供了一种简单有效、与标准推理流水线完全兼容的实用可扩展解决方案。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) rely on key-value (KV) caches for efficient
autoregressive decoding; however, cache size grows linearly with context length
and model depth, becoming a major bottleneck in long-context inference. Prior
KV cache compression methods either enforce rigid heuristics, disrupt tensor
layouts with per-attention-head variability, or require specialized compute
kernels.
  We propose a simple, yet effective, KV cache compression framework based on
attention-guided, layer-adaptive composite tokens. Our method aggregates
attention scores to estimate token importance, selects head-specific tokens
independently, and aligns them into composite tokens that respect the uniform
cache structure required by existing inference engines. A global allocation
mechanism further adapts retention budgets across layers, assigning more
capacity to layers with informative tokens. This approach achieves significant
memory reduction while preserving accuracy, consistently outperforming prior
structured and semi-structured methods. Crucially, our approach remains fully
compatible with standard inference pipelines, offering a practical and scalable
solution for efficient long-context LLM deployment.

Abstract: Deep learning models, especially convolutional neural networks (CNNs), have
shown considerable promise for biomedical signals such as EEG-based seizure
detection. However, these models come with challenges, primarily due to their
size and compute requirements in environments where real-time detection or
limited resources are available. In this study, we present a lightweight
one-dimensional CNN model with structured pruning to improve efficiency and
reliability. The model was trained with mild early stopping to address possible
overfitting, achieving an accuracy of 92.78% and a macro-F1 score of 0.8686.
Structured pruning of the baseline CNN involved removing 50% of the
convolutional kernels based on their importance to model predictions.
Surprisingly, after pruning the weights and memory by 50%, the new network was
still able to maintain predictive capabilities, while modestly increasing
precision to 92.87% and improving the macro-F1 score to 0.8707. Overall, we
present a convincing case that structured pruning removes redundancy, improves
generalization, and, in combination with mild early stopping, achieves a
promising way forward to improve seizure detection efficiency and reliability,
which is clear motivation for resource-limited settings.

Main category: cs.LG

TL;DR: 本文挑战了强化学习中后继矩阵低秩结构的假设，提出移位后继矩阵具有自然低秩特性，并建立了有限样本性能保证和谱可恢复性分析。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现代强化学习算法普遍假设后继矩阵具有低秩结构，但作者发现后继矩阵本身并非低秩，而移位后的版本才具有这种特性，这为改进RL算法提供了新思路。

Method: 通过分析移位后继矩阵的低秩结构，提出基于采样条目的低秩近似估计方法，使用Type II Poincaré不等式量化马尔可夫链的谱可恢复性，并建立移位量与系统局部混合性质的联系。

Result: 理论分析表明近似误差和估计误差主要由谱可恢复性参数控制，所需移位量取决于高阶奇异值衰减且通常较小，实验验证了移位后继矩阵在目标条件RL中的性能提升。

Conclusion: 移位操作能有效揭示后继矩阵的低秩结构，为强化学习算法设计提供了理论基础，通过合理选择移位量可以显著改善目标条件强化学习的性能。

Abstract: Low-rank structure is a common implicit assumption in many modern
reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms. For instance, reward-free and
goal-conditioned RL methods often presume that the successor measure admits a
low-rank representation. In this work, we challenge this assumption by first
remarking that the successor measure itself is not low-rank. Instead, we
demonstrate that a low-rank structure naturally emerges in the shifted
successor measure, which captures the system dynamics after bypassing a few
initial transitions. We provide finite-sample performance guarantees for the
entry-wise estimation of a low-rank approximation of the shifted successor
measure from sampled entries. Our analysis reveals that both the approximation
and estimation errors are primarily governed by the so-called spectral
recoverability of the corresponding matrix. To bound this parameter, we derive
a new class of functional inequalities for Markov chains that we call Type II
Poincar\'e inequalities and from which we can quantify the amount of shift
needed for effective low-rank approximation and estimation. This analysis shows
in particular that the required shift depends on decay of the high-order
singular values of the shifted successor measure and is hence typically small
in practice. Additionally, we establish a connection between the necessary
shift and the local mixing properties of the underlying dynamical system, which
provides a natural way of selecting the shift. Finally, we validate our
theoretical findings with experiments, and demonstrate that shifting the
successor measure indeed leads to improved performance in goal-conditioned RL.

Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become popular across a diverse set of
tasks in exploring structural relationships between entities. However, due to
the highly connected structure of the datasets, distributed training of GNNs on
large-scale graphs poses significant challenges. Traditional sampling-based
approaches mitigate the computational loads, yet the communication overhead
remains a challenge. This paper presents RapidGNN, a distributed GNN training
framework with deterministic sampling-based scheduling to enable efficient
cache construction and prefetching of remote features. Evaluation on benchmark
graph datasets demonstrates RapidGNN's effectiveness across different scales
and topologies. RapidGNN improves end-to-end training throughput by 2.46x to
3.00x on average over baseline methods across the benchmark datasets, while
cutting remote feature fetches by over 9.70x to 15.39x. RapidGNN further
demonstrates near-linear scalability with an increasing number of computing
units efficiently. Furthermore, it achieves increased energy efficiency over
the baseline methods for both CPU and GPU by 44% and 32%, respectively.

Abstract: This work addresses the key challenges of applying federated learning to
large-scale deep neural networks, particularly the issue of client drift due to
data heterogeneity across clients and the high costs of communication,
computation, and memory. We propose FedSub, an efficient subspace algorithm for
federated learning on heterogeneous data. Specifically, FedSub utilizes
subspace projection to guarantee local updates of each client within
low-dimensional subspaces, thereby reducing communication, computation, and
memory costs. Additionally, it incorporates low-dimensional dual variables to
mitigate client drift. We provide convergence analysis that reveals the impact
of key factors such as step size and subspace projection matrices on
convergence. Experimental results demonstrate its efficiency.

Abstract: Mainstream Transformer-based large language models face major efficiency
bottlenecks: training computation scales quadratically with sequence length,
and inference memory grows linearly, limiting long-context processing. Building
large models on non-NVIDIA platforms also poses challenges for stable and
efficient training. To address this, we introduce SpikingBrain, a family of
brain-inspired models designed for efficient long-context training and
inference. SpikingBrain leverages the MetaX GPU cluster and focuses on three
aspects: (1) Model Architecture: linear and hybrid-linear attention
architectures with adaptive spiking neurons; (2) Algorithmic Optimizations: an
efficient, conversion-based training pipeline and a dedicated spike coding
framework; (3) System Engineering: customized training frameworks, operator
libraries, and parallelism strategies tailored to MetaX hardware.
  Using these techniques, we develop two models: SpikingBrain-7B, a linear LLM,
and SpikingBrain-76B, a hybrid-linear MoE LLM. These models demonstrate the
feasibility of large-scale LLM development on non-NVIDIA platforms.
SpikingBrain achieves performance comparable to open-source Transformer
baselines while using only about 150B tokens for continual pre-training. Our
models significantly improve long-sequence training efficiency and deliver
inference with (partially) constant memory and event-driven spiking behavior.
For example, SpikingBrain-7B attains over 100x speedup in Time to First Token
for 4M-token sequences. Training remains stable for weeks on hundreds of MetaX
C550 GPUs, with the 7B model reaching a Model FLOPs Utilization of 23.4
percent. The proposed spiking scheme achieves 69.15 percent sparsity, enabling
low-power operation. Overall, this work demonstrates the potential of
brain-inspired mechanisms to drive the next generation of efficient and
scalable large model design.

Abstract: We present data driven deep learning models for forecasting and monitoring
amine emissions and key performance parameters in amine-based post-combustion
carbon capture systems. Using operational data from the CESAR1 solvent campaign
at Technology Center Mongstad, four DL architectures such as Basic Long
Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Stacked LSTM, Bi-directional LSTM, and Convolutional
LSTM were developed to capture time-dependent process behavior. For emission
prediction, models were designed for 2-amino-2-methyl-1-propanol (AMP) and
Piperazine emissions measured via FTIR and IMR-MS methods. System performance
models target four critical parameters: CO$_2$ product flow, absorber outlet
temperature, depleted flue gas outlet temperature, and RFCC stripper bottom
temperature. These models achieved high predictive accuracy exceeding 99% and
effectively tracked both steady trends and abrupt fluctuations. Additionally,
we conducted causal impact analysis to evaluate how operational variables
influence emissions and system performance. Eight input variables were
systematically perturbed within $\pm$20% of nominal values to simulate
deviations and assess their impact. This analysis revealed that adjusting
specific operational parameters, such as lean solvent temperature and water
wash conditions, can significantly reduce amine emissions and enhance system
performance. This study highlights ML not only as a predictive tool but also as
a decision support system for optimizing carbon capture operations under steady
state and dynamic conditions. By enabling real time monitoring, scenario
testing, and operational optimization, the developed ML framework offers a
practical pathway for mitigating environmental impacts. This work represents a
step toward intelligent, data-driven control strategies that enhance the
efficiency, stability, and sustainability of carbon capture and storage
technologies.

TL;DR: 使用Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN)作为可解释的FDIA检测方法，在AGC系统中实现高达95.97%的攻击检测率，同时提供符号公式增强可解释性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动发电控制(AGC)系统对电网稳定性至关重要，但容易受到隐蔽的网络攻击（如虚假数据注入攻击FDIAs），传统检测方法难以发现这些攻击。现有方法多为黑盒模型，缺乏可解释性。

Method: 提出使用Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN)作为可解释的FDIA检测方法。KAN能够学习AGC测量值之间的复杂非线性关系，并可以提取符号方程来描述训练模型的行为，从而提供比大多数机器学习模型更好的可解释性。

Result: 提出的KAN模型在初始模型和符号公式上分别实现了95.97%和95.9%的FDIA检测率，且具有较低的误报率。

Conclusion: KAN模型为增强AGC系统网络安全提供了一种可靠的方法，既保持了高检测精度，又提供了良好的可解释性，能够有效应对隐蔽的网络攻击。

Abstract: Automatic Generation Control (AGC) is essential for power grid stability but
remains vulnerable to stealthy cyberattacks, such as False Data Injection
Attacks (FDIAs), which can disturb the system's stability while evading
traditional detection methods. Unlike previous works that relied on blackbox
approaches, this work proposes Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) as an
interpretable and accurate method for FDIA detection in AGC systems,
considering the system nonlinearities. KAN models include a method for
extracting symbolic equations, and are thus able to provide more
interpretability than the majority of machine learning models. The proposed KAN
is trained offline to learn the complex nonlinear relationships between the AGC
measurements under different operating scenarios. After training, symbolic
formulas that describe the trained model's behavior can be extracted and
leveraged, greatly enhancing interpretability. Our findings confirm that the
proposed KAN model achieves FDIA detection rates of up to 95.97% and 95.9% for
the initial model and the symbolic formula, respectively, with a low false
alarm rate, offering a reliable approach to enhancing AGC cybersecurity.

Abstract: The growing computational demands of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) have
raised concerns about the environmental and economic costs of training
large-scale models. While algorithmic efficiency in terms of learning
performance has been extensively studied, the energy requirements, greenhouse
gas emissions, and monetary costs of DRL algorithms remain largely unexplored.
In this work, we present a systematic benchmarking study of the energy
consumption of seven state-of-the-art DRL algorithms, namely DQN, TRPO, A2C,
ARS, PPO, RecurrentPPO, and QR-DQN, implemented using Stable Baselines. Each
algorithm was trained for one million steps each on ten Atari 2600 games, and
power consumption was measured in real-time to estimate total energy usage,
CO2-Equivalent emissions, and electricity cost based on the U.S. national
average electricity price. Our results reveal substantial variation in energy
efficiency and training cost across algorithms, with some achieving comparable
performance while consuming up to 24% less energy (ARS vs. DQN), emitting
nearly 68% less CO2, and incurring almost 68% lower monetary cost (QR-DQN vs.
RecurrentPPO) than less efficient counterparts. We further analyze the
trade-offs between learning performance, training time, energy use, and
financial cost, highlighting cases where algorithmic choices can mitigate
environmental and economic impact without sacrificing learning performance.
This study provides actionable insights for developing energy-aware and
cost-efficient DRL practices and establishes a foundation for incorporating
sustainability considerations into future algorithmic design and evaluation.

Abstract: With a very rapid increase in deepfakes and digital image forgeries, ensuring
the authenticity of images is becoming increasingly challenging. This report
introduces a forgery detection framework that combines spatial and
frequency-based features for detecting forgeries. We propose a dual branch
convolution neural network that operates on features extracted from spatial and
frequency domains. Features from both branches are fused and compared within a
Siamese network, yielding 64 dimensional embeddings for classification. When
benchmarked on CASIA 2.0 dataset, our method achieves an accuracy of 77.9%,
outperforming traditional statistical methods. Despite its relatively weaker
performance compared to larger, more complex forgery detection pipelines, our
approach balances computational complexity and detection reliability, making it
ready for practical deployment. It provides a strong methodology for forensic
scrutiny of digital images. In a broader sense, it advances the state of the
art in visual forensics, addressing an urgent requirement in media
verification, law enforcement and digital content reliability.

Abstract: Distributed optimization is fundamental in large-scale machine learning and
control applications. Among existing methods, the Alternating Direction Method
of Multipliers (ADMM) has gained popularity due to its strong convergence
guarantees and suitability for decentralized computation. However, ADMM often
suffers from slow convergence and sensitivity to hyperparameter choices. In
this work, we show that distributed ADMM iterations can be naturally
represented within the message-passing framework of graph neural networks
(GNNs). Building on this connection, we propose to learn adaptive step sizes
and communication weights by a graph neural network that predicts the
hyperparameters based on the iterates. By unrolling ADMM for a fixed number of
iterations, we train the network parameters end-to-end to minimize the final
iterates error for a given problem class, while preserving the algorithm's
convergence properties. Numerical experiments demonstrate that our learned
variant consistently improves convergence speed and solution quality compared
to standard ADMM. The code is available at

Conclusion: DRL-PUT框架有效解决了广告推荐系统中的多目标优化问题，通过强化学习方法实现了更好的性能表现和个性化调优

Abstract: The ranking utility function in an ad recommender system, which linearly
combines predictions of various business goals, plays a central role in
balancing values across the platform, advertisers, and users. Traditional
manual tuning, while offering simplicity and interpretability, often yields
suboptimal results due to its unprincipled tuning objectives, the vast amount
of parameter combinations, and its lack of personalization and adaptability to
seasonality. In this work, we propose a general Deep Reinforcement Learning
framework for Personalized Utility Tuning (DRL-PUT) to address the challenges
of multi-objective optimization within ad recommender systems. Our key
contributions include: 1) Formulating the problem as a reinforcement learning
task: given the state of an ad request, we predict the optimal hyperparameters
to maximize a pre-defined reward. 2) Developing an approach to directly learn
an optimal policy model using online serving logs, avoiding the need to
estimate a value function, which is inherently challenging due to the high
variance and unbalanced distribution of immediate rewards. We evaluated DRL-PUT
through an online A/B experiment in Pinterest's ad recommender system. Compared
to the baseline manual utility tuning approach, DRL-PUT improved the
click-through rate by 9.7% and the long click-through rate by 7.7% on the
treated segment. We conducted a detailed ablation study on the impact of
different reward definitions and analyzed the personalization aspect of the
learned policy model.

Main category: cs.CY

TL;DR: 该研究针对难民和移民学生等弱势群体在网络安全中的脆弱性，通过数字素养培训和钓鱼邮件实验，发现数字素养培训能提高安全意识，但语言障碍和低数字技能仍使难民群体面临较高风险。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 网络钓鱼和复杂的基于邮件的社交工程攻击对弱势群体（如难民和移民学生）影响尤为严重，但这些群体在网络安全研究中被忽视，缺乏相应的安全隐私政策保护，加剧了数字安全鸿沟。

Method: 首先为美国新安置的非洲难民（48人）举办数字素养研讨会，随后对三组参与者进行真实钓鱼邮件欺骗研究：难民组（19人）、非洲移民学生组（142人）和美国本土学生对照组（184人），使用带有语言线索的精心设计邮件。

Result: 数字素养培训提高了难民的安全意识，但由于数字技能低和英语水平有限，他们仍难以识别钓鱼邮件。非洲移民学生和美国本土学生表现更谨慎，但数据泄露在所有组中都很普遍。

Conclusion: 无论数字素养水平如何，都需要培训批判性思考数字安全的能力。安全隐私社区应更好地将边缘化群体纳入政策制定，设计公平、包容的网络安全倡议。

Abstract: Phishing and sophisticated email-based social engineering attacks
disproportionately affect vulnerable populations, such as refugees and
immigrant students. However, these groups remain understudied in cybersecurity
research. This gap in understanding, coupled with their exclusion from broader
security and privacy policies, increases their susceptibility to phishing and
widens the digital security divide between marginalized and non-marginalized
populations. To address this gap, we first conducted digital literacy workshops
with newly resettled African refugee populations (n = 48) in the US to improve
their understanding of how to safeguard sensitive and private information.
Following the workshops, we conducted a real-world phishing deception study
using carefully designed emails with linguistic cues for three participant
groups: a subset of the African US-refugees recruited from the digital literacy
workshops (n = 19), African immigrant students in the US (n = 142), and a
control group of monolingual US-born students (n = 184). Our findings indicate
that while digital literacy training for refugees improves awareness of safe
cybersecurity practices, recently resettled African US-refugees still face
significant challenges due to low digital literacy skills and limited English
proficiency. This often leads them to ignore or fail to recognize phishing
emails as phishing. Both African immigrant students and US-born students showed
greater caution, though instances of data disclosure remained prevalent across
groups. Our findings highlight, irrespective of literacy, the need to be
trained to think critically about digital security. We conclude by discussing
how the security and privacy community can better include marginalized
populations in policy making and offer recommendations for designing equitable,
inclusive cybersecurity initiatives.

TL;DR: 大语言模型会选择退出对话（bail），实验显示实际退出率在0.06-7%之间，受模型、退出方式和提示词影响显著


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 研究LLM在可选择退出时是否会选择终止对话，以了解模型在实际应用中的行为特性

Method: 使用三种退出方法（工具调用、特定字符串、直接询问）在Wildchat和ShareGPT数据集上测试，并构建BailBench综合数据集进行系统化测试

Result: 模型退出率在0.28-32%之间，经调整后实际退出率为0.06-7%；退出行为与拒绝行为相关性不明显，盗版攻击会降低拒绝率但提高退出率

Conclusion: LLM存在退出对话的能力，该行为受多种因素影响，需要在安全性评估中考虑这一特性

Abstract: When given the option, will LLMs choose to leave the conversation (bail)? We
investigate this question by giving models the option to bail out of
interactions using three different bail methods: a bail tool the model can
call, a bail string the model can output, and a bail prompt that asks the model
if it wants to leave. On continuations of real world data (Wildchat and
ShareGPT), all three of these bail methods find models will bail around
0.28-32\% of the time (depending on the model and bail method). However, we
find that bail rates can depend heavily on the model used for the transcript,
which means we may be overestimating real world bail rates by up to 4x. If we
also take into account false positives on bail prompt (22\%), we estimate real
world bail rates range from 0.06-7\%, depending on the model and bail method.
We use observations from our continuations of real world data to construct a
non-exhaustive taxonomy of bail cases, and use this taxonomy to construct
BailBench: a representative synthetic dataset of situations where some models
bail. We test many models on this dataset, and observe some bail behavior
occurring for most of them. Bail rates vary substantially between models, bail
methods, and prompt wordings. Finally, we study the relationship between
refusals and bails. We find: 1) 0-13\% of continuations of real world
conversations resulted in a bail without a corresponding refusal 2) Jailbreaks
tend to decrease refusal rates, but increase bail rates 3) Refusal abliteration
increases no-refuse bail rates, but only for some bail methods 4) Refusal rate
on BailBench does not appear to predict bail rate.

Result: 在470万API代码指纹数据集上评估，覆盖4123个独特Windows API，成功发现65个IDA无法识别的混淆API，对抗攻击性能下降不超过3%。

Conclusion: RINSER是一个高效准确的API预测框架，在恶意软件分析中表现出色，具有强大的抗混淆和抗攻击能力。

Abstract: Malware authors commonly use obfuscation to hide API identities in binary
files, making analysis difficult and time-consuming for a human expert to
understand the behavior and intent of the program. Automatic API prediction
tools are necessary to efficiently analyze unknown binaries, facilitating rapid
malware triage while reducing the workload on human analysts. In this paper, we
present RINSER (AccuRate API predictioN using maSked languagE model leaRning),
an automated framework for predicting Windows API (WinAPI) function names.
RINSER introduces the novel concept of API codeprints, a set of API-relevant
assembly instructions, and supports x86 PE binaries. RINSER relies on BERT's
masked language model (LM) to predict API names at scale, achieving 85.77%
accuracy for normal binaries and 82.88% accuracy for stripped binaries. We
evaluate RINSER on a large dataset of 4.7M API codeprints from 11,098 malware
binaries, covering 4,123 unique Windows APIs, making it the largest publicly
available dataset of this type. RINSER successfully discovered 65 obfuscated
Windows APIs related to C2 communication, spying, and evasion in our dataset,
which the commercial disassembler IDA failed to identify. Furthermore, we
compared RINSER against three state-of-the-art approaches, showing over 20%
higher prediction accuracy. We also demonstrated RINSER's resilience to
adversarial attacks, including instruction randomization and code displacement,
with a performance drop of no more than 3%.

TL;DR: 提出了一种从高分辨率卫星图像中学习多维贫困相关特征的新框架，通过整合可达性、形态学和经济特征，结合后门调整机制，显著提升了城市贫困地图的准确性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有仅依赖城市化特征的模型与贫困指标相关性较弱，因为无规划的城市增长会掩盖经济差异和空间不平等，需要更全面的多维特征来精确映射城市贫困。

Method: 整合三种互补特征：1)对比学习编码基础设施可达性；2)建筑足迹反映非正规住区住房条件；3)夜光强度作为经济活动代理。采用后门调整机制消除虚假相关性。

Result: 在开普敦、达卡和金边三个首都城市的评估中，模型显著优于现有基线方法。

Conclusion: 该框架通过融合多维特征有效捕捉了贫困的复杂性，为数据稀缺地区的贫困地图和政策支持提供了强大工具。

Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning have enabled the inference of urban
socioeconomic characteristics from satellite imagery. However, models relying
solely on urbanization traits often show weak correlations with poverty
indicators, as unplanned urban growth can obscure economic disparities and
spatial inequalities. To address this limitation, we introduce a novel
representation learning framework that captures multidimensional
deprivation-related traits from very high-resolution satellite imagery for
precise urban poverty mapping. Our approach integrates three complementary
traits: (1) accessibility traits, learned via contrastive learning to encode
proximity to essential infrastructure; (2) morphological traits, derived from
building footprints to reflect housing conditions in informal settlements; and
(3) economic traits, inferred from nightlight intensity as a proxy for economic
activity. To mitigate spurious correlations - such as those from
non-residential nightlight sources that misrepresent poverty conditions - we
incorporate a backdoor adjustment mechanism that leverages morphological traits
during training of the economic module. By fusing these complementary features
into a unified representation, our framework captures the complex nature of
poverty, which often diverges from economic development trends. Evaluations
across three capital cities - Cape Town, Dhaka, and Phnom Penh - show that our
model significantly outperforms existing baselines, offering a robust tool for
poverty mapping and policy support in data-scarce regions.

TL;DR: 提出统一表示学习框架，通过多意图建模和不确定性建模联合处理用户意图多样性和行为不确定性，提升推荐系统的准确性和鲁棒性。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 传统推荐方法难以同时处理用户意图的多样性和行为的不确定性，存在建模瓶颈，需要统一的框架来提取多粒度兴趣结构并捕捉行为模糊性和偏好波动。

Method: 构建多意图表示模块和不确定性建模机制：1）使用多个潜在意图向量和注意力机制生成长期偏好表示；2）通过高斯分布学习行为表示的均值和协方差来建模不确定性；3）使用可学习融合策略结合长期意图和短期行为信号。

Result: 在标准公开数据集上实验表明，该方法在多个指标上优于现有代表性模型，在冷启动和行为扰动场景下表现出更好的稳定性和适应性。

Conclusion: 该统一建模策略有效解决了传统方法处理复杂用户行为时的瓶颈问题，在现实推荐任务中具有实际应用价值。

Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of jointly modeling user intent diversity
and behavioral uncertainty in recommender systems. A unified representation
learning framework is proposed. The framework builds a multi-intent
representation module and an uncertainty modeling mechanism. It extracts
multi-granularity interest structures from user behavior sequences. Behavioral
ambiguity and preference fluctuation are captured using Bayesian distribution
modeling. In the multi-intent modeling part, the model introduces multiple
latent intent vectors. These vectors are weighted and fused using an attention
mechanism to generate semantically rich representations of long-term user
preferences. In the uncertainty modeling part, the model learns the mean and
covariance of behavior representations through Gaussian distributions. This
reflects the user's confidence in different behavioral contexts. Next, a
learnable fusion strategy is used to combine long-term intent and short-term
behavior signals. This produces the final user representation, improving both
recommendation accuracy and robustness. The method is evaluated on standard
public datasets. Experimental results show that it outperforms existing
representative models across multiple metrics. It also demonstrates greater
stability and adaptability under cold-start and behavioral disturbance
scenarios. The approach alleviates modeling bottlenecks faced by traditional
methods when dealing with complex user behavior. These findings confirm the
effectiveness and practical value of the unified modeling strategy in
real-world recommendation tasks.

Motivation: 传统单模态兴趣建模方法无法充分抓取复杂多模态内容环境中的用户偏好，需要多模态整合方案来提升短视频平台的个性化推荐效果

Method: 使用跨模态对齐策略将视频帧、文本描述和背景音乐集成到统一语义空间，构建精细程度用户兴趣向量；引入行为驱动的特征嵌入机制，模型动态兴趣演化

Result: 在公开和专有短视频数据集上进行广泛评估，与多个主流推荐算法相比，在行为预测准确性、冷启动用户兴趣建模和推荐点击率方面取得显著提升

Conclusion: 该多模态基础模型框架能够有效提升短视频推荐系统的性能和可解释性，通过注意力机制和特征可视化增强了模型决策透明度，为复杂多模态内容环境下的用户兴趣建模提供了有效解决方案

Abstract: With the rapid expansion of user bases on short video platforms, personalized
recommendation systems are playing an increasingly critical role in enhancing
user experience and optimizing content distribution. Traditional interest
modeling methods often rely on unimodal data, such as click logs or text
labels, which limits their ability to fully capture user preferences in a
complex multimodal content environment. To address this challenge, this paper
proposes a multimodal foundation model-based framework for user interest
modeling and behavior analysis. By integrating video frames, textual
descriptions, and background music into a unified semantic space using
cross-modal alignment strategies, the framework constructs fine-grained user
interest vectors. Additionally, we introduce a behavior-driven feature
embedding mechanism that incorporates viewing, liking, and commenting sequences
to model dynamic interest evolution, thereby improving both the timeliness and
accuracy of recommendations. In the experimental phase, we conduct extensive
evaluations using both public and proprietary short video datasets, comparing
our approach against multiple mainstream recommendation algorithms and modeling
techniques. Results demonstrate significant improvements in behavior prediction
accuracy, interest modeling for cold-start users, and recommendation
click-through rates. Moreover, we incorporate interpretability mechanisms using
attention weights and feature visualization to reveal the model's decision
basis under multimodal inputs and trace interest shifts, thereby enhancing the
transparency and controllability of the recommendation system.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 基础RAG在复杂法律法规QA任务中常遇到摘要漏洞问题，top-k策略容易漏掉重要文本块，导致回答不完整或不准确

Method: 1、One-SHOT摘要方法：基于token预算适配选择文本块，进一步筛选精炼。2、迭代式摘要策略：基于推理自主RAG框架，动态发送搜索查询，评估摘要结果并逐步精炼上下文

Result: 在政府文档数据集上进行了涉及广法的实验，验证了方法的有效性

Conclusion: 提供了在法律法规领域实际应用中的实用见解和指导，通过改进的摘要策略显著提升了RAG系统在复杂QA任务中的表现

Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) based on Large Language Models (LLMs) is
a powerful solution to understand and query the industry's closed-source
documents. However, basic RAG often struggles with complex QA tasks in legal
and regulatory domains, particularly when dealing with numerous government
documents. The top-$k$ strategy frequently misses golden chunks, leading to
incomplete or inaccurate answers. To address these retrieval bottlenecks, we
explore two strategies to improve evidence coverage and answer quality. The
first is a One-SHOT retrieval method that adaptively selects chunks based on a
token budget, allowing as much relevant content as possible to be included
within the model's context window. Additionally, we design modules to further
filter and refine the chunks. The second is an iterative retrieval strategy
built on a Reasoning Agentic RAG framework, where a reasoning LLM dynamically
issues search queries, evaluates retrieved results, and progressively refines
the context over multiple turns. We identify query drift and retrieval laziness
issues and further design two modules to tackle them. Through extensive
experiments on a dataset of government documents, we aim to offer practical
insights and guidance for real-world applications in legal and regulatory
domains.

Motivation: 现有图对比学习方法主要基于图结构扰动和聚类两种数据增强策略，但这些策略获得的交互信息未能充分捕捉用户-物品交互关系

Method: 使用混合矩阵分解方法：低秩矩阵分解(MF)和奇异值分解(SVD)互补获取全局协同信息，构建增强视图

Result: 在多个公开数据集上实验表明，该模型优于现有基线方法，特别是在小规模数据集上表现更佳

Conclusion: HMFGCL方法通过整合两种矩阵分解技术，有效提升了图对比学习在推荐系统中的性能，特别是在数据稀疏场景下

Abstract: In recent years, methods that combine contrastive learning with graph neural
networks have emerged to address the challenges of recommendation systems,
demonstrating powerful performance and playing a significant role in this
domain. Contrastive learning primarily tackles the issue of data sparsity by
employing data augmentation strategies, effectively alleviating this problem
and showing promising results. Although existing research has achieved
favorable outcomes, most current graph contrastive learning methods are based
on two types of data augmentation strategies: the first involves perturbing the
graph structure, such as by randomly adding or removing edges; and the second
applies clustering techniques. We believe that the interactive information
obtained through these two strategies does not fully capture the user-item
interactions. In this paper, we propose a novel method called HMFGCL (Hybrid
Matrix Factorization Based Graph Contrastive Learning), which integrates two
distinct matrix factorization techniques-low-rank matrix factorization (MF) and
singular value decomposition (SVD)-to complementarily acquire global
collaborative information, thereby constructing enhanced views. Experimental
results on multiple public datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms
existing baselines, particularly on small-scale datasets.

Motivation: 评估LLMs在高风险、伦理敏感的建筑项目管理决策中的伦理可靠性和可靠性

Method: 混合方法研究：量化测试两个领先LLMs在12个真实伦理场景中的表现，质性分析12位行业专家访谈

Result: LLMs在法律遵循等结构化领域表现良好，但在处理上下文细节、确保负责和提供透明推理方面存在显著缺陷

Conclusion: LLMs目前适合作为决策支持工具，而非自主伦理决策者，必须强调人类在环中的监督作用

Abstract: The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into construction project
management (CPM) is accelerating, with Large Language Models (LLMs) emerging as
accessible decision-support tools. This study aims to critically evaluate the
ethical viability and reliability of LLMs when applied to the ethically
sensitive, high-risk decision-making contexts inherent in CPM. A mixed-methods
research design was employed, involving the quantitative performance testing of
two leading LLMs against twelve real-world ethical scenarios using a novel
Ethical Decision Support Assessment Checklist (EDSAC), and qualitative analysis
of semi-structured interviews with 12 industry experts to capture professional
perceptions. The findings reveal that while LLMs demonstrate adequate
performance in structured domains such as legal compliance, they exhibit
significant deficiencies in handling contextual nuance, ensuring
accountability, and providing transparent reasoning. Stakeholders expressed
considerable reservations regarding the autonomous use of AI for ethical
judgments, strongly advocating for robust human-in-the-loop oversight. To our
knowledge, this is one of the first studies to empirically test the ethical
reasoning of LLMs within the construction domain. It introduces the EDSAC
framework as a replicable methodology and provides actionable recommendations,
emphasising that LLMs are currently best positioned as decision-support aids
rather than autonomous ethical agents.

TL;DR: Maestro是一个框架无关的LLM智能体整体优化器，通过联合搜索图结构和节点配置来提升智能体质量，在多个基准测试中显著优于现有方法。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有优化器主要调整配置而固定图结构，无法解决结构性故障模式，需要一种能够同时优化图结构和配置的holistic方法。

Method: Maestro框架联合搜索智能体的图结构（模块和信息流）和节点配置（模型、提示、工具等），利用反射性文本反馈来优先处理编辑，提高样本效率。

Result: 在IFBench和HotpotQA基准测试中，Maestro平均超越MIPROv2 12%、GEPA 4.9%、GEPA+Merge 4.86%，即使仅进行提示优化也领先9.65%、2.37%、2.41%，且使用比GEPA更少的rollout。

Conclusion: 联合图结构和配置搜索能够解决单纯提示调优无法修复的结构性故障模式，在多个实际应用中显示出显著优势。

Abstract: Building reliable LLM agents requires decisions at two levels: the graph
(which modules exist and how information flows) and the configuration of each
node (models, prompts, tools, control knobs). Most existing optimizers tune
configurations while holding the graph fixed, leaving structural failure modes
unaddressed. We introduce Maestro, a framework-agnostic holistic optimizer for
LLM agents that jointly searches over graphs and configurations to maximize
agent quality, subject to explicit rollout/token budgets. Beyond numeric
metrics, Maestro leverages reflective textual feedback from traces to
prioritize edits, improving sample efficiency and targeting specific failure
modes. On the IFBench and HotpotQA benchmarks, Maestro consistently surpasses
leading prompt optimizers--MIPROv2, GEPA, and GEPA+Merge--by an average of 12%,
4.9%, and 4.86%, respectively; even when restricted to prompt-only
optimization, it still leads by 9.65%, 2.37%, and 2.41%. Maestro achieves these
results with far fewer rollouts than GEPA. We further show large gains on two
applications (interviewer & RAG agents), highlighting that joint graph &
configuration search addresses structural failure modes that prompt tuning
alone cannot fix.

Motivation: 建模与模拟技术在健康领域具有重要价值，但模型复杂性导致其无法被利益相关者充分利用。当前的大语言模型摘要通常是一式的，无法满足临床医生、政策制定者、患者等不同群体的个性化需求。

Method: 采用混合方法设计：首先引导不同健康利益相关者的解释需求和风格偏好，然后优化大语言模型的零制化输出能力（如通过可控属性调整），最后通过广泛的指标进行评估以进一步改善摘要生成。

Result: 该研究提出了一个系统化框架，能够按照不同健康利益相关者的特定需求生成零制化的模拟解释，解决了当前一式摘要无法满足多样化需求的问题。

Conclusion: 通过识别利益相关者需求并优化LLM生成能力，可以有效提升健康模拟技术的可访问性和实用性，从而更好地支持健康决策和个人健康选择。

Abstract: Modeling & Simulation (M&S) approaches such as agent-based models hold
significant potential to support decision-making activities in health, with
recent examples including the adoption of vaccines, and a vast literature on
healthy eating behaviors and physical activity behaviors. These models are
potentially usable by different stakeholder groups, as they support
policy-makers to estimate the consequences of potential interventions and they
can guide individuals in making healthy choices in complex environments.
However, this potential may not be fully realized because of the models'
complexity, which makes them inaccessible to the stakeholders who could benefit
the most. While Large Language Models (LLMs) can translate simulation outputs
and the design of models into text, current approaches typically rely on
one-size-fits-all summaries that fail to reflect the varied informational needs
and stylistic preferences of clinicians, policymakers, patients, caregivers,
and health advocates. This limitation stems from a fundamental gap: we lack a
systematic understanding of what these stakeholders need from explanations and
how to tailor them accordingly. To address this gap, we present a step-by-step
framework to identify stakeholder needs and guide LLMs in generating tailored
explanations of health simulations. Our procedure uses a mixed-methods design
by first eliciting the explanation needs and stylistic preferences of diverse
health stakeholders, then optimizing the ability of LLMs to generate tailored
outputs (e.g., via controllable attribute tuning), and then evaluating through
a comprehensive range of metrics to further improve the tailored generation of
summaries.

Abstract: In the rapidly evolving field of artificial intelligence (AI), traditional

AI models. We focus on the case of physical world modeling and propose a novel
approach to augment existing benchmarks with human-derived evaluation criteria,
aiming to enhance the interpretability and applicability of model behaviors.
Grounding our study in the Perception Test and OpenEQA benchmarks, we conducted
in-depth interviews and large-scale surveys to identify key cognitive skills,
such as Prioritization, Memorizing, Discerning, and Contextualizing, that are
critical for both AI and human reasoning. Our findings reveal that participants
perceive AI as lacking in interpretive and empathetic skills yet hold high
expectations for AI performance. By integrating insights from our findings into
benchmark design, we offer a framework for developing more human-aligned means
of defining and measuring progress. This work underscores the importance of
user-centered evaluation in AI development, providing actionable guidelines for

Abstract: The convergence of Language models, Agent models, and World models represents
a critical frontier for artificial intelligence. While recent progress has
focused on scaling Language and Agent models, the development of sophisticated,
explicit World Models remains a key bottleneck, particularly for complex,
long-horizon multi-agent tasks. In domains such as robotic soccer, agents
trained via standard reinforcement learning in high-fidelity but
structurally-flat simulators often fail due to intractable exploration spaces
and sparse rewards. This position paper argues that the next frontier in
developing capable agents lies in creating environments that possess an
explicit, hierarchical World Model. We contend that this is best achieved
through hierarchical scaffolding, where complex goals are decomposed into
structured, manageable subgoals. Drawing evidence from a systematic review of
2024 research in multi-agent soccer, we identify a clear and decisive trend
towards integrating symbolic and hierarchical methods with multi-agent
reinforcement learning (MARL). These approaches implicitly or explicitly
construct a task-based world model to guide agent learning. We then propose a
paradigm shift: leveraging Large Language Models to dynamically generate this
hierarchical scaffold, effectively using language to structure the World Model
on the fly. This language-driven world model provides an intrinsic curriculum,
dense and meaningful learning signals, and a framework for compositional
learning, enabling Agent Models to acquire sophisticated, strategic behaviors
with far greater sample efficiency. By building environments with explicit,
language-configurable task layers, we can bridge the gap between low-level
reactive behaviors and high-level strategic team play, creating a powerful and
generalizable framework for training the next generation of intelligent agents.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前大语言模型只能被动处理信息，缺乏系统性探索假设未来的能力，限制了在动态高风险场景（如战略规划、风险评估）中的应用。需要让LLM能够主动预测行动后果。

Method: 整合假设分析(WIA)方法，通过强化学习利用环境反馈，动态模拟每个潜在行动的结果，使模型能够预测未来状态而非仅对当前条件做出反应。在王者荣耀复杂游戏环境中进行验证。

Result: 在王者荣耀游戏中，WiA-LLM实现了74.2%的游戏状态变化预测准确率，比基线方法提升高达2倍。在高难度场景中表现尤为突出，准确预见能力显著提升。

Conclusion: 这是首个正式探索和整合假设分析能力到大语言模型的工作，代表了LLM主动推理能力的根本性进步，为动态环境中的稳健决策提供了可扩展框架。

Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) excel at processing information reactively but
lack the ability to systemically explore hypothetical futures. They cannot ask,
"what if we take this action? how will it affect the final outcome" and
forecast its potential consequences before acting. This critical gap limits
their utility in dynamic, high-stakes scenarios like strategic planning, risk
assessment, and real-time decision making. To bridge this gap, we propose
WiA-LLM, a new paradigm that equips LLMs with proactive thinking capabilities.
Our approach integrates What-If Analysis (WIA), a systematic approach for
evaluating hypothetical scenarios by changing input variables. By leveraging
environmental feedback via reinforcement learning, WiA-LLM moves beyond
reactive thinking. It dynamically simulates the outcomes of each potential
action, enabling the model to anticipate future states rather than merely react
to the present conditions. We validate WiA-LLM in Honor of Kings (HoK), a
complex multiplayer game environment characterized by rapid state changes and
intricate interactions. The game's real-time state changes require precise
multi-step consequence prediction, making it an ideal testbed for our approach.
Experimental results demonstrate WiA-LLM achieves a remarkable 74.2% accuracy
in forecasting game-state changes (up to two times gain over baselines). The
model shows particularly significant gains in high-difficulty scenarios where
accurate foresight is critical. To our knowledge, this is the first work to
formally explore and integrate what-if analysis capabilities within LLMs.
WiA-LLM represents a fundamental advance toward proactive reasoning in LLMs,
providing a scalable framework for robust decision-making in dynamic
environments with broad implications for strategic applications.

<details>

Motivation: 当前XRL方法存在解释结果可理解性有限、工具覆盖孤立的问题，导致用户不确定使用哪种工具，需要改进RL策略的透明度和可解释性。

Method: 采用五智能体架构（协调器、解释器、编码器、评估器、调试器），自动将用户查询映射到相关XRL工具，通过关键状态变量、预期结果或反事实解释来阐明智能体行为。

Result: 在四水箱过程控制问题上验证，成功高精度映射用户查询到XRL任务，编码器-调试器交互最小化了反事实生成失败，定性评估证实能有效解释智能体行为。

Conclusion: TalkToAgent框架通过多智能体LLM协作，显著提升了RL策略的可解释性和用户理解，为XRL领域提供了有效的交互式解释解决方案。

Abstract: Explainable Reinforcement Learning (XRL) has emerged as a promising approach
in improving the transparency of Reinforcement Learning (RL) agents. However,
there remains a gap between complex RL policies and domain experts, due to the
limited comprehensibility of XRL results and isolated coverage of current XRL
approaches that leave users uncertain about which tools to employ. To address
these challenges, we introduce TalkToAgent, a multi-agent Large Language Models
(LLM) framework that delivers interactive, natural language explanations for RL
policies. The architecture with five specialized LLM agents (Coordinator,
Explainer, Coder, Evaluator, and Debugger) enables TalkToAgent to automatically
map user queries to relevant XRL tools and clarify an agent's actions in terms
of either key state variables, expected outcomes, or counterfactual
explanations. Moreover, our approach extends previous counterfactual
explanations by deriving alternative scenarios from qualitative behavioral
descriptions, or even new rule-based policies. We validated TalkToAgent on
quadruple-tank process control problem, a well-known nonlinear control
benchmark. Results demonstrated that TalkToAgent successfully mapped user
queries into XRL tasks with high accuracy, and coder-debugger interactions
minimized failures in counterfactual generation. Furthermore, qualitative
evaluation confirmed that TalkToAgent effectively interpreted agent's actions
and contextualized their meaning within the problem domain.

Conclusion: 该研究首次系统地定义了语言模型在长期合作行为中的特征，为未来复杂人机智能社会环境的研究奠定了基础

Abstract: Language models are increasingly deployed in interactive online environments,
from personal chat assistants to domain-specific agents, raising questions
about their cooperative and competitive behavior in multi-party settings. While
prior work has examined language model decision-making in isolated or
short-term game-theoretic contexts, these studies often neglect long-horizon
interactions, human-model collaboration, and the evolution of behavioral
patterns over time. In this paper, we investigate the dynamics of language
model behavior in the iterated prisoner's dilemma (IPD), a classical framework
for studying cooperation and conflict. We pit model-based agents against a
suite of 240 well-established classical strategies in an Axelrod-style
tournament and find that language models achieve performance on par with, and
in some cases exceeding, the best-known classical strategies. Behavioral
analysis reveals that language models exhibit key properties associated with
strong cooperative strategies - niceness, provocability, and generosity while
also demonstrating rapid adaptability to changes in opponent strategy mid-game.
In controlled "strategy switch" experiments, language models detect and respond
to shifts within only a few rounds, rivaling or surpassing human adaptability.
These results provide the first systematic characterization of long-term
cooperative behaviors in language model agents, offering a foundation for
future research into their role in more complex, mixed human-AI social
environments.

### [121] [Cloning a Conversational Voice AI Agent from Call\,Recording Datasets for Telesales](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04871)
*Krittanon Kaewtawee,Wachiravit Modecrua,Krittin Pachtrachai,Touchapon Kraisingkorn*

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: 通过语音识别、大语言模型和语音合成技术，建立了一种从电话录音库克隆对话式语音助手的方法，在销售场景中达到了接近人类表现的效果。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 自动化重复性任务、降低运营成本、提供24小时支持，并在消费者服务和医疗健康等领域部署语音助手系统。

Method: 整合自动语音识别(ASR)、基于大语言模型的对话管理器和文本转语音(TTS)合成技术，通过域选择、知识提取和prompt工程构建流式推理流水线，从顶级人类销售员的录音中学习结构化脚本。

Result: 在22项标准的盲测评估中，AI助手在常规通话方面接近人类表现，但在说服和异议处理方面较差，通过prompt精炼改善了这些短板。

Conclusion: 提供了设计经验和未来研究方向，包括大规模模拟和自动化评估。该方法可扩展到任何有电话试卷的领域。

Abstract: Recent advances in language and speech modelling have made it possible to
build autonomous voice assistants that understand and generate human dialogue
in real time. These systems are increasingly being deployed in domains such as
customer service and healthcare care, where they can automate repetitive tasks,
reduce operational costs, and provide constant support around the clock. In
this paper, we present a general methodology for cloning a conversational voice
AI agent from a corpus of call recordings. Although the case study described in
this paper uses telesales data to illustrate the approach, the underlying
process generalizes to any domain where call transcripts are available. Our
system listens to customers over the telephone, responds with a synthetic
voice, and follows a structured playbook learned from top performing human
agents. We describe the domain selection, knowledge extraction, and prompt
engineering used to construct the agent, integrating automatic speech
recognition, a large language model based dialogue manager, and text to speech
synthesis into a streaming inference pipeline. The cloned agent is evaluated
against human agents on a rubric of 22 criteria covering introduction, product
communication, sales drive, objection handling, and closing. Blind tests show
that the AI agent approaches human performance in routine aspects of the call
while underperforming in persuasion and objection handling. We analyze these
shortcomings and refine the prompt accordingly. The paper concludes with design
lessons and avenues for future research, including large scale simulation and
automated evaluation.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: OSC是一个知识感知的自适应协作框架，通过实时认知差距分析和动态调整通信行为，显著提升多智能体系统的认知协同效率和任务性能


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多智能体系统中专家智能体之间深度协作的语言交互瓶颈问题，现有工作在智能体选择和结果聚合方面有进展，但高效的语言交互仍是关键瓶颈

Method: 引入协作知识模型(CKM)，使每个智能体能动态感知协作者的认知状态；通过实时认知差距分析，自适应调整通信行为（内容焦点、细节层次、表达风格）；使用学习策略优化交互

Result: 在复杂推理和问题解决基准测试中，OSC显著提高了任务性能和通信效率，将"并行工作的个体"转变为"深度协作的认知团队"

Conclusion: OSC不仅优化了多智能体协作，还为LLM智能体交互行为提供了新的见解，作为选择和聚合之间的关键中间层发挥了重要作用

Abstract: This paper introduces OSC (Orchestrating Cognitive Synergy), a
knowledge-aware adaptive collaboration framework designed to enhance cognitive
synergy in multi-agent systems with large language models. While prior work has
advanced agent selection and result aggregation, efficient linguistic
interactions for deep collaboration among expert agents remain a critical
bottleneck. OSC addresses this gap as a pivotal intermediate layer between
selection and aggregation, introducing Collaborator Knowledge Models (CKM) to
enable each agent to dynamically perceive its collaborators' cognitive states.
Through real-time cognitive gap analysis, agents adaptively adjust
communication behaviors, including content focus, detail level, and expression
style, using learned strategies. Experiments on complex reasoning and
problem-solving benchmarks demonstrate that OSC significantly improves task
performance and communication efficiency, transforming "parallel-working
individuals'' into a "deeply collaborative cognitive team.'' This framework not
only optimizes multi-agent collaboration but also offers new insights into LLM
agent interaction behaviors.

Main category: cs.AI

TL;DR: SparkUI-Parser是一个新颖的端到端GUI解析框架，通过连续坐标建模和拒绝机制，显著提升了多模态大语言模型在GUI感知中的定位精度和解析能力。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 现有MLLM方法存在两个主要问题：1）基于文本自回归机制的离散坐标建模导致定位精度低、推理速度慢；2）只能定位预定义元素集合，无法解析整个界面，限制了广泛应用和下游任务支持。

Method: 提出基于预训练MLLM的连续坐标建模方法，添加token路由器和坐标解码器，并引入基于改进匈牙利匹配算法的拒绝机制来识别和拒绝不存在的元素。

Result: 在ScreenSpot、ScreenSpot-v2、CAGUI-Grounding和ScreenParse等多个基准测试中一致优于最先进方法。

Conclusion: SparkUI-Parser通过连续建模和拒绝机制，有效解决了现有MLLM在GUI感知中的局限性，实现了更高的定位精度和更细粒度的界面解析能力。

Abstract: The existing Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for GUI perception have
made great progress. However, the following challenges still exist in prior
methods: 1) They model discrete coordinates based on text autoregressive
mechanism, which results in lower grounding accuracy and slower inference
speed. 2) They can only locate predefined sets of elements and are not capable
of parsing the entire interface, which hampers the broad application and
support for downstream tasks. To address the above issues, we propose
SparkUI-Parser, a novel end-to-end framework where higher localization
precision and fine-grained parsing capability of the entire interface are
simultaneously achieved. Specifically, instead of using probability-based
discrete modeling, we perform continuous modeling of coordinates based on a
pre-trained Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) with an additional token
router and coordinate decoder. This effectively mitigates the limitations
inherent in the discrete output characteristics and the token-by-token
generation process of MLLMs, consequently boosting both the accuracy and the
inference speed. To further enhance robustness, a rejection mechanism based on
a modified Hungarian matching algorithm is introduced, which empowers the model
to identify and reject non-existent elements, thereby reducing false positives.
Moreover, we present ScreenParse, a rigorously constructed benchmark to
systematically assess structural perception capabilities of GUI models across
diverse scenarios. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach
consistently outperforms SOTA methods on ScreenSpot, ScreenSpot-v2,
CAGUI-Grounding and ScreenParse benchmarks. The resources are available at
https://github.com/antgroup/SparkUI-Parser.

Motivation: 解决大型语言模型作为对话代理时的可控性挑战，确保可预测和用户个性化的响应，特别是在定性对话特征的形式化定义方面。

Method: 使用语言描述符将定性概念转化为定量定义，构建描述逻辑本体，通过微调指导LLM进行受控文本生成，以CEFR语言熟练度级别为案例研究。

Result: 实验结果表明该方法提供了一致且可解释的熟练度定义，提高了对话AI的透明度。

Conclusion: 基于本体的方法能够有效形式化对话特征，实现LLM的可控文本生成，为对话AI提供更透明和可解释的控制机制。

Abstract: The controllability of Large Language Models (LLMs) when used as
conversational agents is a key challenge, particularly to ensure predictable
and user-personalized responses. This work proposes an ontology-based approach
to formally define conversational features that are typically qualitative in
nature. By leveraging a set of linguistic descriptors, we derive quantitative
definitions for qualitatively-defined concepts, enabling their integration into
an ontology for reasoning and consistency checking. We apply this framework to
the task of proficiency-level control in conversations, using CEFR language
proficiency levels as a case study. These definitions are then formalized in
description logic and incorporated into an ontology, which guides controlled
text generation of an LLM through fine-tuning. Experimental results demonstrate
that our approach provides consistent and explainable proficiency-level
definitions, improving transparency in conversational AI.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: AI智能体将互联网转变为智能体网络，但缺乏全局透明的交互网络和碎片化的使用信号使得智能体排名难以实现，需要协调机制来解决

Method: 提出DOVIS五层操作协议（发现、编排、验证、激励、语义）来收集最小化隐私保护的使用和性能聚合数据，并实现AgentRank-UC算法结合使用频率和能力指标进行统一排名

Result: 通过仿真实验和理论分析证明了协议的收敛性、鲁棒性和抗Sybil攻击能力，展示了协调协议和性能感知排名在构建可扩展可信智能体网络中的可行性

Conclusion: DOVIS协议和AgentRank-UC算法为实现规模化、可信的智能体网络提供了可行的技术方案，解决了智能体生态系统中的协调和排名挑战

Abstract: AI agents -- powered by reasoning-capable large language models (LLMs) and
integrated with tools, data, and web search -- are poised to transform the
internet into a \emph{Web of Agents}: a machine-native ecosystem where
autonomous agents interact, collaborate, and execute tasks at scale. Realizing
this vision requires \emph{Agent Ranking} -- selecting agents not only by
declared capabilities but by proven, recent performance. Unlike Web~1.0's
PageRank, a global, transparent network of agent interactions does not exist;
usage signals are fragmented and private, making ranking infeasible without
coordination.
  We propose \textbf{DOVIS}, a five-layer operational protocol
(\emph{Discovery, Orchestration, Verification, Incentives, Semantics}) that
enables the collection of minimal, privacy-preserving aggregates of usage and
performance across the ecosystem. On this substrate, we implement
\textbf{AgentRank-UC}, a dynamic, trust-aware algorithm that combines
\emph{usage} (selection frequency) and \emph{competence} (outcome quality,
cost, safety, latency) into a unified ranking. We present simulation results
and theoretical guarantees on convergence, robustness, and Sybil resistance,
demonstrating the viability of coordinated protocols and performance-aware
ranking in enabling a scalable, trustworthy Agentic Web.

<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 当前测试时扩展方法主要依赖冗余采样，忽略了历史经验的利用，限制了计算效率。需要一种能够有效利用历史尝试来指导推理过程的方法。

Method: 提出Sticker-TTS框架，使用三个协作的LRM模型，通过提取、精炼和重用关键信息（称为sticker）进行多轮推理。采用两阶段优化策略，结合模仿学习和自我改进实现渐进式精炼。

Result: 在三个具有挑战性的数学推理基准测试（AIME-24、AIME-25、OlymMATH）上，Sticker-TTS在可比推理预算下 consistently超越强基线方法，包括自一致性和先进强化学习方法。

Conclusion: sticker引导的历史经验利用是有效的，该框架显著提高了大型推理模型的性能和计算效率。

Abstract: Large reasoning models (LRMs) have exhibited strong performance on complex
reasoning tasks, with further gains achievable through increased computational
budgets at inference. However, current test-time scaling methods predominantly
rely on redundant sampling, ignoring the historical experience utilization,
thereby limiting computational efficiency. To overcome this limitation, we
propose Sticker-TTS, a novel test-time scaling framework that coordinates three
collaborative LRMs to iteratively explore and refine solutions guided by
historical attempts. At the core of our framework are distilled key
conditions-termed stickers-which drive the extraction, refinement, and reuse of
critical information across multiple rounds of reasoning. To further enhance
the efficiency and performance of our framework, we introduce a two-stage
optimization strategy that combines imitation learning with self-improvement,
enabling progressive refinement. Extensive evaluations on three challenging
mathematical reasoning benchmarks, including AIME-24, AIME-25, and OlymMATH,
demonstrate that Sticker-TTS consistently surpasses strong baselines, including
self-consistency and advanced reinforcement learning approaches, under
comparable inference budgets. These results highlight the effectiveness of
sticker-guided historical experience utilization. Our code and data are
available at https://github.com/RUCAIBox/Sticker-TTS.

TL;DR: ProToM是一个基于心理理论的AI系统，通过贝叶斯逆规划和期望效用最大化来提供针对性反馈，促进多智能体系统中的亲社会行为，在任务成功率和完成时间上优于现有大语言模型。


<details>
  <summary>Details</summary>
Motivation: 解决多智能体系统中智能体在追求独立目标时难以确定何时以及如何协助他人的问题，促进亲社会行为（即使与自身目标不完全一致但有益他人的行为）。

Method: 使用贝叶斯逆规划推断智能体目标，然后基于推断的目标分布通过最大化期望效用来选择上下文敏感的反馈信息。

Result: 在Doors、Keys、Gems和Overcooked环境中，ProToM相比现有大语言模型实现了更高的任务成功率、更短的任务完成时间，并获得人类用户的一致偏好。

Conclusion: ProToM能够提供针对性强的有效反馈，而现有大语言模型在提供上下文接地且时机恰当的反馈方面存在不足，导致更高的通信开销和较低的任务加速效果。

Abstract: While humans are inherently social creatures, the challenge of identifying
when and how to assist and collaborate with others - particularly when pursuing
independent goals - can hinder cooperation. To address this challenge, we aim
to develop an AI system that provides useful feedback to promote prosocial
behaviour - actions that benefit others, even when not directly aligned with
one's own goals. We introduce ProToM, a Theory of Mind-informed facilitator
that promotes prosocial actions in multi-agent systems by providing targeted,
context-sensitive feedback to individual agents. ProToM first infers agents'
goals using Bayesian inverse planning, then selects feedback to communicate by
maximising expected utility, conditioned on the inferred goal distribution. We
evaluate our approach against baselines in two multi-agent environments: Doors,
Keys, and Gems, as well as Overcooked. Our results suggest that
state-of-the-art large language and reasoning models fall short of
communicating feedback that is both contextually grounded and well-timed -
leading to higher communication overhead and task speedup. In contrast, ProToM
provides targeted and helpful feedback, achieving a higher success rate,
shorter task completion times, and is consistently preferred by human users.

Motivation: ODRL已成为数字资源访问和使用的实际标准，但缺乏全面的形式语义。现有研究对语言特性的形式化规范进展有限，需要为ODRL提供更完善的形式语义基础。

Method: 采用基于查询应答的方法为ODRL提供简单直观的形式语义，该方法改进了之前的规范化工作，并与ODRL 2.2最新规范保持一致。

Result: 建立了ODRL的完整形式语义框架，能够精确定义策略的评估语义。基于此语义定义了策略比较问题，可检测策略间的等价关系、限制程度和宽松程度。

Conclusion: 提出的形式语义为ODRL策略评估提供了理论基础，策略比较功能特别适用于数据共享场景，有助于实现更精确和可靠的数字权利管理。

Abstract: We consider the problem of evaluating, and comparing computational policies
in the Open Digital Rights Language (ODRL), which has become the de facto
standard for governing the access and usage of digital resources. Although
preliminary progress has been made on the formal specification of the
language's features, a comprehensive formal semantics of ODRL is still missing.
In this paper, we provide a simple and intuitive formal semantics for ODRL that
is based on query answering. Our semantics refines previous formalisations, and
is aligned with the latest published specification of the language (2.2).
Building on our evaluation semantics, and motivated by data sharing scenarios,
we also define and study the problem of comparing two policies, detecting
equivalent, more restrictive or more permissive policies.

Abstract: Recent research has been increasingly focusing on developing 3D world models
that simulate complex real-world scenarios. World models have found broad
applications across various domains, including embodied AI, autonomous driving,
entertainment, etc. A more realistic simulation with accurate physics will
effectively narrow the sim-to-real gap and allow us to gather rich information
about the real world conveniently. While traditional manual modeling has
enabled the creation of virtual 3D scenes, modern approaches have leveraged
advanced machine learning algorithms for 3D world generation, with most recent
advances focusing on generative methods that can create virtual worlds based on
user instructions. This work explores such a research direction by proposing
LatticeWorld, a simple yet effective 3D world generation framework that
streamlines the industrial production pipeline of 3D environments. LatticeWorld
leverages lightweight LLMs (LLaMA-2-7B) alongside the industry-grade rendering
engine (e.g., Unreal Engine 5) to generate a dynamic environment. Our proposed
framework accepts textual descriptions and visual instructions as multimodal
inputs and creates large-scale 3D interactive worlds with dynamic agents,
featuring competitive multi-agent interaction, high-fidelity physics
simulation, and real-time rendering. We conduct comprehensive experiments to
evaluate LatticeWorld, showing that it achieves superior accuracy in scene
layout generation and visual fidelity. Moreover, LatticeWorld achieves over a
$90\times$ increase in industrial production efficiency while maintaining high
creative quality compared with traditional manual production methods. Our demo
